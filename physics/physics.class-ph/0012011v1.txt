Abstract

Special relativity is reformulated as a symmetry property of space-time: Space-
Time Exchange Invariance. The additional hypothesis of spatial homogeneity is
then suﬃcient to derive the Lorentz transformation without reference to the tradi-
tional form of the Principle of Special Relativity. The kinematical version of the
latter is shown to be a consequence of the Lorentz transformation. As a dynamical
application, the laws of electrodynamics and magnetodynamics are derived from
those of electrostatics and magnetostatics respectively. The 4-vector nature of the
electromagnetic potential plays a crucial role in the last two derivations.

Introduction

Two postulates were essential for Einstein’s original axiomatic derivation [1] of the Lorentz
transformation (LT) : (i) the Special Relativity Principle and (ii) the hypothesis of the
constancy of the velocity of light in all inertial frames (Einstein’s second postulate). The
Special Relativity Principle, which states that:

‘The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames’

had long been known to be respected by Newton’s laws of mechanics at the time
Einstein’s paper was written. Galileo had already stated the principle in 1588 in his
‘Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences’. The title of Einstein’s paper [1] ‘On the
Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies’ and the special role of light in his second postulate
seem to link special relativity closely to classical electrodynamics. Indeed, the LT was
discovered as the transformation that demonstrates that Maxwell’s equations may be
written in the same way in any inertial frame, and so manifestly respect the Special
Relativity Principle. The same close connection between special relativity and classical
electrodynamics is retained in virtually all text-book treatments of the subject, obscuring
the essentially geometrical and kinematical nature of special relativistic eﬀects. The latter
actually transcend the dynamics of any particular physical system. It was realised, shortly
after the space-time geometrical nature of the LT was pointed out by Minkowski [2],
that the domain of applicability of the LT extends beyond the classical electrodynamics
considered by Einstein, and that, in fact, Einstein’s second postulate is not necessary for
its derivation [3, 4]. There is now a vast literature devoted to derivations of the LT that
do not require the second postulate [5].

In a recent paper by the present author [6], the question of the minimum number
of postulates, in addition to the Special Relativity Principle, necessary to derive the
LT was addressed. The aim of the present paper is somewhat diﬀerent. The Special
Relativity Principle itself is re-stated in a simple mathematical form which, as will be
shown below, has both kinematical and dynamical applications. The new statement is a
symmetry condition relating space and time, which, it is conjectured, is respected by the
mathematical equations that decscribe all physical laws [7]. The symmetry condition is
ﬁrst used, together with the postulate of the homogeneity of space, to derive the LT. It
is then shown that the Kinematical Special Relativity Principle (KSRP) is a necessary
consequence of the LT. The KSRP, which describes the reciprocal nature of similar space
time measurements made in two diﬀerent inertial frames [8], states that:

‘Reciprocal space-time measurements of similar measuring rods and clocks
at rest in two diﬀerent inertial frames S, S′ by observers at rest in S′, S
respectively, yield identical results’

There is no reference here to any physical law. Only space-time events that may con-
stitute the raw material of any observation of a physical process are considered. In the
previous literature the KSRP (or some equivalent condition applied to a gedankenexper-
iment [9]) has been been used as a necessary postulate to derive the LT.

The symmetry condition that restates the Special Relativity Principle is:

1

(I) ‘The equations describing the laws of physics are invariant with respect
to the exchange of space and time coordinates, or, more generally, to the
exchange of the spatial and temporal components of four vectors.’

A corollary is:

(II) ‘Predictions of physical theories do not depend on the metric sign conven-
tion (space-like or time-like) used to deﬁne four-vector scalar products.’

A proof of this corollary is presented in Section 4 below.

As will become clear during the following discussion, the operation of Space-Time
Exchange (ST E) reveals an invariance property of pairs of physical equations, which are
found to map into each other under ST E. The examples of this discussed below are: the
Lorentz transformation equations of space and time, the Maxwell equations describing
electrostatics (Gauss’ law) and electrodynamics (Amp`ere’s law), and those describing
magnetostatics (Gauss’ law) and magnetodynamics (The Faraday-Lenz law). It will be
demonstrated that each of these three pairs of equations map into each other under ST E,
and so are invariants of the ST E operator. In the case of the LT equations, imposing
ST E symmetry is suﬃcient to derive them from a general form of the space transformation
equation that respects the classical limit.

The expression: ‘The equations describing the laws of physics’ in (I) should then be
understood as including both equations of each ST E invariant pair. For example, the
Gauss equation of electrostatics, considered as an independent physical law, clearly does
not respect (I).

For dimensional reasons, the deﬁnition of the exchange operation referred to in (I)
requires the time coordinate to be multiplied by a universal parameter V with the dimen-
sions of velocity. The new time coordinate with dimension[L]:

x0

V t

(1.1)

≡
may be called the ‘causality radius’ [10] to distinguish it from the cartesian spatial co-
ordinate x or the invariant interval s. Since space is three dimensional and time is one
dimensional, there is a certain ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the exchange operation in
(I). Depending on the case under discussion, the space coordinate may be either the mag-
, or a cartesian component x1,x2,x3. For any physical
nitude of the spatial vector x =
problem with a preferred spatial direction (which is the case for the LT), then, by a suit-
able choice of coordinate system, the identiﬁcation x = x1, x2 = x3 = 0 is always possible.
The exchange operation in (I) is then simply x0
x1. Formally, the exchange operation
is deﬁned by the equations:

~x
|
|

↔

where ST E denotes the space time exchange operator. As shown below, for problems
where there is no preferred direction, but rather spatial symmetry, it may also be useful

ST Ex0 = x1
ST Ex1 = x0
(ST E)2 = 1

(1.2)
(1.3)
(1.4)

to deﬁne three exchange operators:
x0

xi

↔

i = 1, 2, 3

(1.5)

with associated operations ST E(i) analagous to ST E = ST E(1) in Eqns.(1.2)-(1.4). The
operations in Eqns.(1.2) to (1.5) may also be generalised to the case of an arbitary 4-vector
with temporal and spatial components A0 and A1 respectively.

To clarify the meaning of the ST E operation, it is of interest to compare it with a
diﬀerent operator acting on space and time coordinates that may be called ‘Space-Time
Coordinate Permutation’ (ST CP ). Consider an equation of the form:

f (x0, x1) = 0.

(1.6)

The ST E conjugate equation is:

f (x1, x0) = 0.
(1.7)
This equation is diﬀerent from (1.6) because x0 and x1 have diﬀerent physical meanings.
In the ST CP operation however, the values of the space and time coordinates are inter-
changed, but no new equation is generated. If x0 = a and x1 = b in Eqn.(1.6) then the
ST CP operation applied to the latter yields:

f (x0 = b, x1 = a) = 0.

(1.8)

This equation is identical in form to (1.6); only its parameters have diﬀerent values.

The physical meaning of the universal parameter V , and its relation to the velocity of

light, c, is discussed in the following Section, after the derivation of the LT.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In the following Section the LT is derived. In
Section 3, the LT is used to derive the KSRP. The space time exchange properties of
4-vectors and the related symmetries in Minkowski space are discussed in Section 4. In
Section 5 the space-time exchange symmetries of Maxwell’s equations are used to derive
electrodynamics (Amp`ere’s law) and magnetodynamics (the Faraday-Lenz law) from the
Gauss laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics respectively. A summary is given in
Section 6.

2 Derivation of the Lorentz Transformation

Consider two inertial frames S,S′. S′ moves along the common x, x′ axis of orthogonal
cartesian coordinate systems in S,S′ with velocity v relative to S. The y, y′ axes are also
parallel. At time t = t′ = 0 the origins of S and S′ coincide. In general the transformation
equation between the coordinate x in S of a ﬁxed point on the Ox′ axis and the coordinate
x′ of the same point referred to the frame S′ is :

where β

Eqns.(2.5),(2.9) with γ given by (2.14) are the LT equations for space-time points along
the common x, x′ axis of the frames S,S′. They have been derived here solely from the
symmetry condition (I) and the assumption of spatial homogeneity, without any reference
to the Principle of Special Relativity.

The physical meaning of the universal parameter V becomes clear when the kinemat-
ical consequences of the LT for physical objects are worked out in detail. This is done,
for example, in Reference [6], where it is shown that the velocity of any massive physical
object approaches V in any inertial frame in which its energy is much greater than its
rest mass. The identiﬁcation of V with the velocity of light, c, then follows [13, 6] if it
is assumed that light consists of massless (or almost massless) particles, the light quanta
discovered by Einstein in his analysis of the photoelectric eﬀect [15]. That V is the lim-
iting velocity for the applicability of the LT equations is, however, already evident from
Eqn.(2.14). If γ(β) is real then β

3 Derivation of the Kinematical Special Relativity

Principle

The LT equations (2.5) and (2.9) and their inverses, written in terms of x, x′; t, t′ are:

Consider now observers, at rest in the frames S,S′, equipped with identical measuring
rods and clocks. The observer in S′ places a rod, of length l, along the common x, x′
x′
axis. The coordinates in S′ of the ends of the rod are x′
1 = l. If the
observer in S measures, at time t in his own frame, the ends of the rod to be at x1, x2

Consider now a clock at rest in S′ at x′ = 0. This clock is synchronized with a similar
clock in S at t = t′ = 0, when the spatial coordinate systems in S and S′ coincide.
Suppose that the observer at rest in S notes the time t recorded by his own clock, when
the moving clock records the time τ . At this time, the clock which is moving along the
common x, x′ axis with velocity v will be situated at x = vt. With the deﬁnition τS ≡

that x =

where the 1-axis is chosen parallel to ~v. The proof proceeds as before with the space
time exchange operation deﬁned as in Eqns.(1.2)-(1.4). The additional transformation
equations :

follow from spatial isotropy [1].

In the above derivation of the LT, application of the ST E operator generates the LT
of time from that of space. It is the pair of equations that is invariant with respect to the
ST E operation. Alternatively, as shown below, by a suitable change of variables, equiva-
lent equations may be deﬁned that are manifestly invariant under the ST E operation.

The 4-vector velocity U and the energy-momentum 4-vector P are deﬁned in terms of

the space-time 4-vector [2]:

where m is the Newtonian mass of the physical object and τ is its proper time, i.e. the
time in a reference frame in which the object is at rest. Since τ is a Lorentz invariant
quantity, the 4-vectors U, P have identical LT properties to X. The properties of U, P
under the ST E operation follow directly from Eqns.(1.2),(1.3) and the deﬁnitions (4.4)
and (4.5). Writing the energy-momentum 4-vector as:

the ST E operations: p0

The 4-vector product changes sign, and so the combined ST E operation is equivalent to
a change in the sign convention of the metric from space-like to time-like (or vice versa ),
hence the corollary (II) in Section 1 above.

The LT equations take a particularly simple form if new variables are deﬁned which

have simple transformation properties under the ST E operation. The variables are:

x+, x− have, respectively, even and odd ‘ST E parity’:

The manifestly ST E invariant LT equations expressed in terms of these variables are:

where

Introducing similar variables for an arbitary 4-vector:

the 4-vector scalar product of C and D may be written as:

C

D = C+D− + C−D+

·

In view of the LT equations (4.16),(4.17) C

D is manifestly Lorentz invariant. The
transformations (4.12),(4.13) and (4.19),(4.20) correspond to an anti-clockwise rotation
by 45◦ of the axes of the usual ct versus x plot. The x+,x− axes lie along the light cones
of the x-ct plot (see Fig.1).

·

The LT equations (4.16),(4.17) give a parametric representation of a hyperbola in
x+,x− space. A point on the latter corresponds to a particular space-time point as viewed
in a frame S. The point x+ = x− = 0 corresponds to the space-time origin of the frame
S′ moving with velocity βc relative to S. A point at the spatial origin of S′ at time t′ = τ
will be seen by an observer in S, as β (and hence α) varies, to lie on one of the hyperbolae

time point at the origin of S or S′, whereas (4.23) corresponds to the ‘elsewhere’ of the
same space-time points. That is, the manifold of all space-time points that are causally
disconnected from them. These are all familiar properties of the Minkowski space x-ct
plot. One may note, however, the simplicity of the equations (4.16),(4.17),(4.22), (4.23)
containing the ‘lightcone’ variables x+, x− that have simple transformation properties
under the ST E operation.

Another application of ST E symmetry may be found in [16]. It is shown there that
the apparent distortions of space-time that occur in observations of moving bodies or
clocks are related by this symmetry. For example, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction is
directly related to Time Dilatation by the ST E operations (1.2) and (1.3).

5 Dynamical Applications of Space Time Exchange

Symmetry

If a physical quantity is written in a manifestly covariant way, as a function of 4-vector
products, it will evidently be invariant with respect to ST E as the exchange operation
has the eﬀect only of changing the sign convention for 4-vector products from space-like
to time-like or vice-versa. An example of such a quantity is the invariant amplitude
M
for an arbitary scattering process in Quantum Field Theory. In this case ST E invariance
is equivalent to Corollary II of Section 1 above.

More interesting results can be obtained from equations where components of 4-vectors
appear directly. It will now be shown how ST E invariance may be used to derive Amp`ere’s
law and Maxwell’s ‘displacement current’ from the Gauss law of electrostatics, and the
Faraday-Lenz law of magnetic induction from the the Gauss law of magnetostatics (the
absence of magnetic charges). Thus electrodynamics and magnetodynamics follow from
the laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics, together with space time exchange symmetry
invariance. It will be seen that the 4-vector character of the electromagnetic potential
plays a crucial role in these derivations.

In the following, Maxwell’s equations are written in Heaviside-Lorentz units with V =
c = 1 [17]. The 4-vector potential A = (A0; ~A) is related to the electromagnetic ﬁeld
tensor F µν by the equation:

The transformation properties of contravariant and covariant 4-vectors under the ST E
operation are now discussed. They are derived from the general condition that 4-vector
products change sign under the ST E operation (Eqn.(4.11)). The 4-vector product (4.9)

mation equation (5.7) is correlated to the minus sign in front of the spatial components
of a covariant 4-vector, not whether the Lorentz index is an upper or lower one. Thus ∂µ
and ∂µ transform in an ‘anomalous’ manner under ST E as compared to the convention
of Eqns.(5.6) and (5.7). In order that the 4-vector product ∂µAµ respect the condition

Some comments now on the conditions for the validity of the above derivations. It is
essential to use the manifestly covariant form of the electrostatic Gauss law Eqn.(5.14)
and the manifestly rotationally invariant form, Eqn.(5.22), of the magnetostatic Gauss
law. For example, the 1-axis may be chosen parallel to the electric ﬁeld in Eqn.(5.13). In
this case Eqn.(5.14) simpliﬁes to

∂1(∂0A1

∂1A0) = j0

(5.27)

Applying the space-time exchange operation 0
1 to this equation yields only the
Maxwell displacement current term in Eqn.(5.19). Similarly, choosing the 1-axis parallel
to ~B in Eqn.(5.21) simpliﬁes Eqn.(5.22) to
∂1(∂3A2

∂2A3) = 0

(5.28)

↔

The index exchange 1

0 leads then to the equation:

→

−

∂B1

= 0

instead of the 1-component of the Faraday-Lenz law, as in Eqn.(5.24).

The choice of the ST E transformation properties of contravariant and covariant 4-
vectors according to Eqns.(5.6) and (5.7) is an arbitary one. Identical results are obtained
if the opposite convention is used. However, ‘anomalous’ transformation properties of ∂µ,
∂µ and Aµ, Aµ, in the sense described above, are essential. This complication results from
the upper index on the left side of Eqn.(5.2) whereas on the right side the spatial derivative
is multiplied by a minus sign. This minus sign changes the ST E transformation property
relative to that, (5.6), of conventional contravariant 4-vectors, that do not have a minus
sign multiplying the spatial components. The upper index on the left side of Eqn.(5.2) is a
consequence of the Lorentz transformation properties of the four dimensional space-time
derivative [18].

6 Summary and Discussion

In this paper the Lorentz transformation for points lying along the common x, x′ axis of
two inertial frames has been derived from only two postulates: (i) the symmetry principle
(I), and (ii) the homogeneity of space. This is the same number of axioms as used in
Ref.[6] where the postulates were: the Kinematical Special Relativity Postulate and the
uniqueness condition. Since both spatial homogeneity and uniqueness require the LT
equations to be linear, the KSRP of Ref.[6] has here, essentially, been replaced by the
space-time symmetry condition (I).

Although postulate (I) and the KRSP play equivalent roles in the derivation of the LT,
they state in a very diﬀerent way the physical foundation of special relativity. Postulate (I)
is a mathematical statement about the structure of the equations of physics, whereas the
KSRP makes, instead, a statement about the relation between space-time measurements
performed in two diﬀerent inertial frames. It is important to note that in neither case
do the dynamical laws describing any particular physical phenomenon enter into the
derivation of the LT.

Choosing postulate (I) as the fundamental principle of special relativity instead of the
Galilean Relativity Principle, as in the traditional approach, has the advantage that a clear
distinction is made, from the outset, between classical and relativistic mechanics. Both
the former and the latter respect the Galilean Relativity Principle but with diﬀerent laws.
On the other hand, only relativistic equations, such as the LT or Maxwell’s Equations,
respect the symmetry condition (I).

The teaching of, and hence the understanding of, special relativity diﬀers greatly
depending on how the parameter V is introduced. In axiomatic derivations of the LT,
that do not use Einstein’s second postulate, a universal parameter V with the dimensions
of velocity necessarily appears at an intermediate stage of the derivation [19]. Its physical
meaning, as the absolute upper limit of the observed velocity of any physical object, only
becomes clear on working out the kinematical consequences of the LT [6]. If Einstein’s
second postulate is used to introduce the parameter c, as is done in the vast majority
of text-book treatments of special relativity, justiﬁed by the empirical observation of the
constancy of the velocity of light, the actual universality of the theory is not evident.
The misleading impression may be given that special relativity is an aspect of classical
electrodynamics, the domain of physics in which it was discovered.

Formulating special relativity according to the symmetry principle (I) makes clear
the space-time geometrical basis [2] of the theory. The universal velocity parameter V
must be introduced at the outset in order even to deﬁne the space-time exchange op-
eration. Unlike the Galilean Relativity Principle, the symmetry condition (I) gives a
clear test of whether any physical equation is a candidate to describe a universal law of
physics. Such an equation must either be invariant under space-time exchange or related
by the exchange operation to another equation that also represents a universal law. The
invariant amplitudes of quantum ﬁeld theory are an example of the former case, while
the LT equations for space and time correspond to the latter. Maxwell’s equations are
examples of dynamical laws that satisfy the symmetry condition (I). The laws of electro-
statics and magnetostatics (Gauss’ law for electric and magnetic charges) are related by

14

the space-time exchange symmetry to the laws of electrodynamics (Amp`ere’s law) and
magnetodynamics (the Faraday-Lenz law) respectively. The 4-vector character [20] of the
electromagnetic potential is essential for these symmetry relations [21].

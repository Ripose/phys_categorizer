In this paper we consider the electric multipole moments of fractal distribution of charges. To de-
scribe fractal distribution, we use the fractional integrals. The fractional integrals are considered as
approximations of integrals on fractals. In the paper we compute the electric multipole moments for
homogeneous fractal distribution of charges.

1 Introduction

Integrals and derivatives of fractional order have found many applications in recent studies in science.
The interest in fractals and fractional analysis has been growing continually in the last few years.
Fractional derivatives and integrals have numerous applications: kinetic theories [1, 2, 3]; statistical
mechanics [4, 5, 6]; dynamics in complex media [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]; electrodynamics [12, 13, 14, 15] and
many others. The new type of problem has increased rapidly in areas in which the fractal features
of a process or the medium imposes the necessity of using non-traditional tools in smooth physical
In order to use fractional derivatives and fractional integrals for fractal distribution, we
models.
must use some continuous medium model [7, 8]. We propose to describe the fractal distribution by a
fractional continuous medium [7, 8], where all characteristics and ﬁelds are deﬁned everywhere in the
volume but they follow some generalized equations which are derived by using fractional integrals. In
many problems the real fractal structure of a medium can be disregarded and the fractal distribution
can be replaced by some fractional continuous mathematical model. By smoothing of microscopic
characteristics over the physically inﬁnitesimal volume, we transform the initial fractal distribution
into a fractional continuous model [7, 8] that uses the fractional integrals. The order of fractional
integral is equal to the fractal dimension of distribution. The fractional integrals allow us to take
into account the fractality of the media [7]. Fractional integrals are considered as approximations
of integrals on fractals [16]. It was proved that integrals on net of fractals can be approximated by
fractional integrals [16].
[4, 5], we proved that fractional integrals can be considered as
integrals over the space with fractional dimension up to a numerical factor.

In Refs.

In this paper, we consider electric multipole moments of the fractal distribution of charges. Fractal
distribution is described by the fractional continuous model [7, 8, 9, 10]. In the general case, the fractal
distribution cannot be considered as a continuous distribution. There are domains that are not ﬁlled
by particles. We suggest [7] to consider the fractal distribution as a special (fractional) continuous

distribution. We use the procedure of replacement of the distribution with fractal dimension by some
continuous model that uses fractional integrals. The suggested procedure can be considered as a
fractional generalization of the Christensen approach [17].

In Sec. 2, the density of electric charge for fractal distribution is considered.

In Sec. 3, we
consider the electric multipole expansion. In Sec. 4, the examples of electric dipole moment for fractal
distribution of chages are derived. In Sec. 5, we consider the electric quadrupole moment of fractal
distribution of charges. In Sec. 6, the examples of electric quadrupole moments of charged fractal
parallelepiped are computed.
In Sec. 7, the examples of electric quadrupole moments of charged
fractal ellipsoid are computed. Finally, a short conclusion is given in Sec. 8.

2 Electric Charge of Fractal Distribution

Let us consider a fractal distribution of charges. For example, we can assume that charged particles
with a constant density are distributed over the fractal. In this case, the number of particles N (R)
enclosed in a volume with characteristic size R satisﬁes the scaling law

whereas for a regular n-dimensional Euclidean object we have N (R)

For charged particles with number density n(r, t), we have that the charge density can be deﬁned

Here we use Cartesian’s coordinates x, y, and z. In order to have the usual dimensions of the physical
values, we can use vector r, and coordinates x, y, z as dimensionless values.

Note that the interpretation of fractional integration is connected with noninteger dimension [4,
5]. This interpretation follows from the well-known formulas for dimensional regularizations. The
fractional integral can be considered as an integral in the noninteger dimension space up to the
numerical factor Γ(D/2)/(2πD/2Γ(D)).

Fractal distribution of charged particles is called a homogeneous fractal distribution if the power
RD does not depend on the translation of the region. The homogeneity property of
law Q(R)
the distribution can be formulated in the following form: For all regions W and W ′ such that the
volumes are equal V (W ) = V (W ′), we have that the number of particles in these regions are equal
N (W ) = N (W ′). Note that the wide class of the fractal media satisﬁes the homogeneous property. In
Refs. [7, 8], the continuous medium model for the fractal distribution was suggested.

3 Electric Multipole Expansion for Fractal Distribution of Charges

It is known that a multipole expansion is a series expansion of the eﬀect produced by a given system in
terms of an expansion parameter which becomes small as the distance away from the system increases.

3

Therefore, the leading one of the terms in a multipole expansion are generally the strongest. The ﬁrst-
order behavior of the system at large distances can therefore be obtained from the ﬁrst terms of this
series, which is generally much easier to compute than the general solution. Multipole expansions
are most commonly used in problems involving the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of charge and current
distributions, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves.

To compute one particular case of a multipole expansion, let R = Xkek be the vector from a ﬁxed
reference point to the observation point; r = xkek be the vector from the reference point to a point
in the distribution; and s = R
r be the vector from a point in the distribution to the observation
point. The law of cosines then yields

4 Electric Dipole Moment of Fractal Distribution of Charges

An electric multipole expansion is a determination of the voltage V due to a collection of charges
obtained by performing a multipole expansion. This corresponds to a series expansion of the charge
density ρ(r) in terms of its moments, normalized by the distance to a point R far from the charge
distribution. In MKS, the electric multipole expansion is given by Eq. (18):

In this paper, we use fractional continuous model for fractal distribution of electric charges. The
fractional continuous models for fractal distribution of particles can have a wide application. This is
due in part to the relatively small number of parameters that deﬁne a fractal distribution of great
complexity and rich structure. In many cases, the real fractal structure of matter can be disregarded
and the distribution of particles can be replaced by some fractional continuous model [7, 8]. In order to
describe the distribution with noninteger dimension, we must use the fractional calculus. Smoothing
of the microscopic characteristics over the physically inﬁnitesimal volume transforms the initial fractal
distribution into fractional continuous model that uses the fractional integrals. The order of fractional
integral is equal to the fractal dimension of the distribution. The fractional continuous model for
the fractal distribution allows us to describe dynamics of a wide class fractal media [8, 9, 3]. One
of the dynamical equation of physics is a Liouville equation. Note that the Liouville equation is a
cornerstone of the statistical mechanics. The fractional generalization of the Liouville equation was
[4, 6]. The fractional generalization of the Liouville equation allows us to derive
suggested in Refs.
the fractional generalization of the Bogoliubov equations [5]. Using fractional analog of the Liouville
equation [4] and Bogoliubov equations [5, 6], we can derive the description of a fractal distribution
as a fractional system. Fractional systems can be considered as a special case of non-Hamiltonian
systems [4, 5]. Note that non-Hamiltonian systems can have stationary states of the Hamiltonian
systems [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].

Abstract
A mathematical expression of the quantitative causal principle is given, using
the expression this paper shows the uniﬁed descriptions of D’Alembert-Lagrange,
virtual work, Jourdian, Gauss and general D’Alembert-Lagrange principles of
diﬀerential style, ﬁnds the intrinsic relations among these variational principles,
among the conservation quantities and the Noether conservation charges of the
all diﬀerential variational principles.

There are numerous variational principles in physics, they are classiﬁed into
two kinds, i.e., they are diﬀerential and integral variational principles respectively[1,
2]. It is well known that the uniﬁed descriptions of the relations among so many
scrappy variational principles have not been presented up to now, and the in-
trinsic relations among the conservation quantities of these principles are not
obtained either[3].

On the other hand, in quantum ﬁeld theory the causal principle demands if
the square of the distance of spacetime coordinates of two boson (or fermion)
operators is timelike, their commutator (or anticommutator) is not equal to zero,
their measures are then coherent, for spacelike no coherent[4]. The dispersion
relations can be deduced by the causal principle etc[5], and general scientiﬁc
theories of physics should satisfy the elementary demand of the causal principle.
Therefore, the causal principle is essential to research physical laws.

In real physics, the quantitative action (cause) of some quantities must lead
to the equal action (result), that is, how much loses (cause), how much gains
(result), which is just the quantitative causal principle with the no-loss-no-gain
character[6]. Which can be concretely expressed as

DG − CG = 0

(1)

Eq.(1)’s physical meanings are that the real physical result produced by any
operator set D acting on G must lead to appearance of set C acting on G so
that DG equates to CG, where D and C may be the same or diﬀerent operator
sets, the whole process satisﬁes the quantitative causal principle so that Eq.(1)’s
right hand side satisﬁes the no-loss-no-gain principle in the Universe[6]. Eq.(1)
is thus viewed as a mathematical expression of the quantitative causal principle.

It can be seen that gauge ﬁelds of physical fundamental interactions are just
connections of principal bundle[7], the connections are obtained by Eq.(1) when
D is a connection operator, G = S section of the bundle, C = ω connection[8].
And Eq.(1) is useful for the following studies.

When G is a functional, C identity, D group operator of inﬁnitesimal continu-
ous transformation in Eq(1)[9, 10], the general expression of variational principle
of diﬀerential style is obtained as follows

△G = DG(q(t),

where

△q(r)

i = δq(r)

i (t′) + q(r+1)

i △t

Using δ

.
qi= d(δqi)/dt of equal time variational and substituting Eq(3) into

Eq.(2) , △G is then rewritten as

(5)

Namely, in a ﬁxed inﬁnitesimal time gap, the comparisons of the actual variation
of the system with the other possible variations make G take limit value, and it is
at the limit value that the system satisﬁes the quantitative causal principle with
the no-loss-no-gain character.

When the system satisﬁes the Euler-Lagrange equation ∂G

On the other hand, when integrating Eq.(5) during [t1, t2], and taking condi-
tion (i): qi |t=t1 = δqi |t=t2 = 0; or taking condition (ii): {· · ·}(t1) = {· · ·}(t2), we
have

When G is taken as Lagrangian L of the holonomic system or non-holonomic
system that can be transformed into holonomic system[11], G can be generally
written as

where Fi and Ri are general force and constraint force of the i th components of

Generally, when q

Expression (20) is also called general k-order variational principle. When k
takes value from zero to any ﬁnite positive integer, Eq.(20) gives diﬀerent varia-
tional principles, thus, for diﬀerent k, we can deﬁne the diﬀerent variational prin-
ciple. In the past, these principles are obtained by postulating Eq.(12) existence,
multiplying Eq.(12) with δq(r)
i (t) and summing subscript i. Only D’Alembert-
Lagrange principle and Gauss principle can be obtained by variational principle
and the lest action principle respectively[2, 12]. Now we generally deduce Eq.(20)
by means of the quantitative causal principle, give the uniﬁed description and
their intrinsic relations of all variational principles of diﬀerential style.

Now we generally consider conservation laws of all variational principles of

diﬀerential style.

In the condition (ii) above, when t1 , t2 and t in given [t01,t02] are arbitrary,

we obtain the conservation quantity

Expressions (6) and (21) are the same conservation quantities of the systems,
that is, they are just the found conservation quantities of the all variational prin-
ciples above. We now use the conservation quantities to ﬁnd the Noether conser-
vation charges of the systems. When the systems have the invariant properties
under the operations of Lie group D = Dm, we have[9, 10]

△q(r)

i = δq(r)

i + q(r+1)

i △t = δq(r)

i + q(r+1)

εστ σ = εσ(ξσ

(22)

where

∂t′(q(t),

|α=0 (σ = 1, 2, · · · , m)

(23)

|α=0 (σ = 1, 2, · · · , m; r = 0, 1)

(24)

in which ασ (σ = 1, 2, · · · , m) are m linearly independent inﬁnitesimal continuous
transformation parameters of Lie group Dm, Eq.(23) and Eq.(24) are inﬁnitesimal
generated functions under the transformation of spacetime coordinates about Lie
group Dm, εσ (σ = 1, 2, · · · , m) are inﬁnitesimal parameters corresponding to ασ
. Using Eqs.(21-24) and εσ’s arbitration, we obtain the Noether conservation
charges of the all diﬀerential variational principles as follows

(25)

we thus get the conclusion that the Noether conservation charges of the all dif-
ferential variational principles are the same under the operation of Lie group
Dm.

Because the quantitative causal principle is more general, the applications
of the principle to all integral variational principle, high order Lagrangian and
ﬁeld theory will be written in the other papers (e.g., Ref.[13] gives a new general
variational principle in the same time).

In summary, this paper gives a mathematical expression of the quantitative
causal principle, presents the uniﬁed descriptions of D’Alembert-Lagrange, vir-
tual work, Jourdian, Gauss and general D’Alembert-Lagrange principles of dif-
ferential style, ﬁnds the conservation quantities of the all variational principles
above, the intrinsic relations among the all diﬀerential variational principles are
exposed, and it is discovered that the conservation quantities of the all varia-
tional principles above are the same, and their Noether conservation charges of
the all diﬀerential variational principles are yet the same under the operation of
Lie group Dm.

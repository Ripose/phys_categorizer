Abstract

In this work we include, for the Carnot cycle, irreversibilities of linear ﬁnite rate of heat
transferences between the heat engine and its reservoirs, heat leak between the reservoirs and
internal dissipations of the working ﬂuid. A ﬁrst optimization of the power output, the eﬃciency
and ecological function of an irreversible Carnot cycle, with respect to: internal temperature
ratio, time ratio for the heat exchange and the allocation ratio of the heat exchangers; is per-
formed. For the second and third optimizations, the optimum values for the time ratio and
internal temperature ratio are substituted into the equation of power and, then, the optimiza-
tions with respect to the cost and eﬀectiveness ratio of the heat exchangers are performed.
Finally, a criterion of partial optimization for the class of irreversible Carnot engines is herein
presented.

Introduction

The thermal eﬃciency of a reversible Carnot cycle is an upper limit of eﬃciency for heat engines.
In according to classical thermodynamics, the Carnot eﬃciency is:

ηC = 1

TL
TH

−

(1)

where TL and TH are the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs between which the heat
engine operates. The thermal eﬃciency ηC can only be achieved through the inﬁnitely slow process
required by thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain a certain amount of
power output by using heat exchangers with ﬁnite heat transfer areas. Thus, the thermal eﬃciency
given in equation (1) does not have great signiﬁcance and is a poor guide for the performances of
real heat engines.

A more realistic upper bound could be placed on the eﬃciency of a heat engine operating at its

maximum power point; the so-called CA eﬃciency (Curzon-Alhborn [1]):

where the only source of irreversibility in the engine is a linear ﬁnite rate heat transfer between the
working ﬂuid and its two heat reservoirs.

Real heat engines are complex devices. Besides the irreversibility of ﬁnite-rate heat transfer
in ﬁnite time taken into account in the Curzon-Ahlborn engine (CA-engine), there are also other
sources of irreversibility, such as heat leaks, dissipative processes inside the working ﬂuid and so on.
Thus, it is necessary to investigate more comprehensively the inﬂuence of ﬁnite-rate heat transfer
together with other major irreversibilities on the performance of heat engines. For this aim, we
must consider general irreversible Carnot engines including three major irreversibilities, which often
exist in heat engines, and use it to optimize the performance of an irreversible Carnot engine for
several objective functions.

In the past decade some new models of irreversible Carnot engines which include other irre-
versibilities, besides thermal resistance, have been established: heat leak and internal dissipations
of the working ﬂuid (see [2], [3], [4], [5] , [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] and included references there). Never-
theless, there are another parameters involved in the performance and optimization of an irreversible
Carnot cycle; for instance, the allocation ratio of the heat exchangers, cost and eﬀectiveness ratio
of the heat exchangers and so on (see [8], [9] and [14]).

In the optimization of Carnot cycles, including those irreversibilities, has appeared four objective
functions: power, eﬃciency, ecological and entropy generation. The maximum power and eﬃciency
have been obtained in [4], [5] and [10]. The maximum ecological function was obtained in [12]
for the CA-engine and in form more general in [7]. Bejan [13] has considered the minimization of
the entropy generation. In general, these optimizations were performed with respect to only one
characteristic parameter: internal temperature ratio.

In the ﬁrst analysis of the CA-engine the time ratio of heat transfer from hot to cold side was
considered, but in further works this ratio was not taken into account (see [2] for details).
In
this work this relation is considered as a parameter. On the other hand, [13] has performed the
optimization, also, with respect to other parameter: the allocation ratio of the heat exchangers;
and [14] has considered as parameters the cost and eﬀectiveness ratio of the heat exchangers for
the CA-engine.

In this work we include, for the Carnot cycle, irreversibilities of linear ﬁnite rate of heat trans-
ferences between the heat engine and its reservoirs, heat leak between the reservoirs and internal
dissipations of the working ﬂuid. A ﬁrst optimization of the power output, the eﬃciency and eco-
logical function of an irreversible Carnot cycle, with respect to:
internal temperature ratio, time
ratio for the heat exchange and the allocation ratio of the heat exchangers; is performed. For the
second and third optimizations, the optimum values for the time ratio and internal temperature
ratio are substituted into the equation of power and, then, the optimizations with respect to the
cost and eﬀectiveness ratio of the heat exchangers are performed. Finally, a criterion of partial
optimization for the class of irreversible Carnot engines is herein presented.

This paper is organized as follows. In the section 2 the relations for the dimensionless power,
eﬃciency, entropy generation and ecological function of a class of irreversible Carnot engines are
presented. In the section 3, the optimal analytical expressions for the eﬃciencies corresponding to
power and ecological function; and maximum eﬃciency are shown. In section 4, the optimum values
for the time ratio and internal temperature ratio are substituted in the expression for dimensionless
power. Then a second and third optimizations of dimensionless power, are performed with respect
to the cost and eﬀectiveness ratio of the heat exchangers. In the section of Conclusions, a criterion
of partial optimization for power, ecological function, eﬃciency and entropy generation is presented.

Irreversible Carnot engine.

In considering the class of irreversible Carnot engines (see [2]) shown in Figure 1, which satisfy the
following ﬁve conditions:

(i) The cycle of the engine consists of two isothermal and two adiabatic processes. The temper-
atures of the working ﬂuid in the hot and cold isothermal processes are, respectively, T1 and T2,
and the times of the two isothermal processes are, respectively, tH and tL. The temperatures of
the hot and cold heat reservoirs are, respectively, TH and TL.

(i) There is thermal resistance between the working ﬂuid and the heat reservoirs.
(ii) There is a heat lost Qleak from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir [13]. In real engines
heat leaks are unavoidable, there are many features of an actual power plant which fall under that
kind of irreversibility, such as the heat lost through the walls of a boiler, a combustion chamber, or
a heat exchanger, and heat ﬂow through the cylinder walls of an internal combustion engine, and
so on.

(iii) All heat transfer is assumed to be linear in temperature diﬀerences, that is, Newtonian.
(iv) Besides thermal resistance and heat loss, there are other irreversibilities in the cycle, the
internal irreversibilities. For many devices such as gas turbines, automotive engines, and thermo-
electric generator, there are other loss mechanisms, like friction or generators losses, etc. that play
an important role, but are hard to model in detail. Some authors use the compressor (pump) and
turbine isentropic eﬃciencies to model the internal loss in the gas turbines or steam plants. Others,
in Carnot cycles, use simply one parameter to describe the internal losses. Such a parameter is
associated with the entropy produced inside the engine during a cycle. Speciﬁcally, this parameter

Thus, the irreversible Carnot engine operates with ﬁxed time t allowed for each cycle. The heat

where α, β and K are the thermal conductances and tH , tL are the time for the heat transfer in the
isothermal branches, respectively. The connecting adiabatic branches are often assumed to proceed
in negligible time ([3]), such that the cycle contact total time t is [11]:

By ﬁrst law and combining equations (3) and (2) we obtain :

Now, the equation (5) gives us the total time of the cycle, so it can be parametrized as:

where y = tH

t = tH

is other characteristic parameter of the engine.

Another parameter is the allocation of the exchangers heat [13]. The thermal conductances can

be written as:

tH = yt; tL = (1

y)t

−

α = U AH ; β = U AL

where U is overall heat transfer coeﬃcient and AH and AL are the available areas for heat transfer.
Then, an approach might be to suppose that U is ﬁxed, the same for the hot side and the cold side
heat exchangers, and that the area A can be allocated between both. The optimization problem is
then selected, besides of the optimum temperature ratio and the time ratio, as the best allocation
ratio. To take U A as a ﬁxed value can be justiﬁed in terms of the area purchased, and the ﬁxed
running costs and capital costs that altogether determine the overall heat transfer coeﬃcient (see
([14])). Thus, for the optimization we can take:

3 Maximum power, ecological function and eﬃciency.

In using the equation (10) and the extremes conditions:

∂p
∂x |(xmp,ymp,zmp) = 0;

∂p
∂y |(xmp,ymp,zmp) = 0;

∂p
∂z |(xmp,ymp,zmp) = 0

when the power reaches its maximum, xmp, ymp and zmp are given by:

In eliminating the solutions without physical meaning, we see that there is only one global
critical point given by the equations (15, 16). Moreover, at this critical point maximum power
developed. Indeed, a suﬃcient condition for maximum power is, the eingenvalues of the Hessian
(

) must be negatives ([15]). It is clearly fulﬁlled that:

The generation of entropy is minimum when y and z are given by equation (16) and x =
µ
. Nevertheless, for these values it is seen that the corresponding power does not have physical
√I
meaning. For x = µ
I (y = 0, 1 or z = 0, 1), makes the ﬁrst term of the equation(13) zero. The
corresponding values of y, z are also without physical meaning. For x = µ (y = 0, 1 or z = 0, 1) do
not have physical meaning either. Therefore, for this kind of Carnot engine, the entropy generation
does not have a global minimum within the valid interval. In [16] an engine that corresponds with
the kind of irreversible Carnot cycles herein presented is analyzed but the calculations leading to the
minimization of entropy generation are at fault, since they do not have physical meaning. It results
that the obtained power is negative! Thus, it is only possible to minimize the entropy generation
partially for the variables y, z and those values are given by:

In doing a analogous analysis for the ecological function, we have by the equation (14) that the

unique critical point of ecological function solutions with physical meaning is:

and newly can see that its Hessian has all its negative eingenvalues.

The eﬃciency that maximizes the ecological function ηmec is given by (equation (12)):

(cid:16)
Similarly, it’s easily seen that there is only one critical point, with physical meaning, for the

eﬃciency, and it is given by:

(cid:19)

To see, as above, that the eﬃciency reaches a maximum, becomes to cumbersome a task if the
solution of systems of equations are undertaken. Therefore, an alternative way is presented in that
follows, to obtain equation (22). And when the eﬃciency reaches its maximum (xme, yme, zme) is
given by the equations(22,23).

Indeed, clearly the values of yme, zme given by the equation (23) fulﬁll the following two extreme

conditions:

∂η
∂y

= 0;

= 0

∂η
∂z

Furthermore, as it was seen above, the optimal time ratio and the allocation ratio are the same

for both maximum power and ecological function (equations (19), (20)). Therefore,

ymp = ymec = yme = zmp = zmec = zme =

1
3√I + 1

Thus, this values could be included in the equations of power and heat transfer (equations
(10,11)) and proceed to optimizes the eﬃciency (equation (12) by the following criterion valid when
there is only one parameter([10]):

The behavior of the eﬃciencies ηmp, ηmec and ηmax is shown in the Figure 2.
In general it has been supposed that I

this case the internal irreversibilities can be physically interpreted as part of the engine’s heat leak
that brings us to the engine modeled in [2] and [13]. So, substitution of I = 1 into equations (15;

some of these results have been reported in the literature [6].

On the other hand, the optimization performed in this work gives results that could be applied

to the design of power plants. For instance, in the third section it is found that for

ymp = ymσ = ymec = yme = zmp = zmσ = zmec = zme =

1
3√I + 1

the engine operates at maximum power, eﬃciency and ecological function and entropy generation
local minimum. Therefore, the time rate in the isothermal processes satisﬁes:

This result generalizes to one presented in [2]. And when I = 1,

Similarly, it follows from the equation (29) that when the engine operates at maximum power,
eﬃciency and ecological function, the relation for the heat transfer areas for the cold side to the
hot side, is:

AL
AH

= 3√I

=

This result shows that the size of the heat exchanger in the cold side must be larger than the size
of heat exchanger in the hot side. Thus, in accordance with the deﬁnitions adopted for the thermal
conductance, if I > 1 the one for the cold side results greater than the hot side. Furthermore, if
I = 1

which implies that the allocation of the heat exchangers is balanced ([13]) .

By the equations (30; 31) we have:

which is satisﬁed when the heat engine operates to maximum power, ecological function and eﬃ-
ciency, and minimum entropy generation. In [17] the above relationship was obtained, by a double
optimization of power and eﬃciency. For I > 1, the irreversibility produces an inverse relationship
between the total area and the total contact time; that is, a less time is needed to transfer the heat
that the engine processes. This is due to the fact that less heat goes through the engine. Part of
the heat is lost because of internal irreversibility. For I = 1, the relationship between area and
contact time is inversely proportional; that is, if the area is augmented the time is reduced. This
result does not depend explicitly of I and diﬀers of one presented in [4] and [2].

4 A cost and eﬀectiveness optimization.

A more detailed model would involve acknowledgement that the cost of providing the same heat
transfer capability diﬀers between the cold and hot sides. Let this represented as having a cost per
unit heat transfer to be cL on the cold side but cH on the hot side ([14]). Then

where C is ﬁxed total cost. Thus we have that the third characteristic parameter z1 changes to:

The Figure 3 shows the behavior of η∗mpversus c.

In general, there are two design rules for heat exchange at the two ends of the heat engine ([18]).

The ﬁrst rule is that the thermal conductance is constrained:

where γ is a constant; which was applied herein for the allocation of the heat exchangers (see
equation (9) with γ = U A).

α + β = γ

L = 0.01.

The second rule is that the total is constrained by

A = AH + AL

where AH , AL are heat transfer areas on hot and cold side.

To apply the second rule, we may be faced with an existing heat exchange apparatus which is
to be redistributed between hot and cold sides to achieve maximum power. Now, the total area A
is ﬁxed but when distributed it has diﬀerent overall heat transfer coeﬃcients and hence diﬀerent
eﬀectiveness on hot and cold sides. Thus,

where UH , UL are overall heat transfer coeﬃcients on hot and cold side. In parametrizing again.

This result has been reported by [19] (when I = 1) using another thermoeconomic criterion. How-
ever, it diﬀers when I

5 Conclusion.

In the above section, the optimization has been carried for one objective function, that is, the power
developed, respect to two additional parameters. These parameters could be treated as economic
ones. Moreover, the obtained values, also optimizes the other considered objective functions. Such
as, entropy generation, ecological function and eﬃciency. This is due to the fact that the analyzed
Carnot engine satisfy the following partial criterion:

Criterion If fi = fi(x, z, z∗, z∗∗...) represents one of the four objective functions, that is, power,
eﬃciency, ecological function or entropy generation; with (power, i = 1, ...4; x as the internal
temperature ratio; z, z∗, z∗∗.... are the characteristic-economic parameters of Carnot cycles
belonging to the class of Carnot irreversible cycles analyzed. Moreover, if zmj, z∗mj, z∗∗mj...are
the optimum values for functions fj for some j, then zmj, z∗mj, z∗∗mj...are also the optimum
values for the functions fi, for i

= j.

It is a fact that it suﬃces to develop the optimization for a couple of objective functions, say the
power and the eﬃciency to obtain the parameters that optimizes the remaining objective functions.
For instance, the power and the eﬃciency satisfy the following functional relationship (equation

(12)):

Therefore,

This implies that their roots are the same (necessary condition).

It is easily seen that for

φmp = φme, the power and the eﬃciency reach a maximum (suﬃciency condition)

A remarkable conclusion of this work is that it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd the extreme of some of the

functions fi, say the power so that

where φ = z, z∗, z∗∗...and then substitute in the appropriate functional relationship (for the eﬃ-
ciency is equation(32)) the values of φmp = φme. The obtained fi = fi (x) (η = η(x)) are then
optimized respect to the x parameter only. It is found that the result optimizes the other objective
functions.

In other words, for the class of irreversible Carnot engines considered in this work, the x pa-
rameter could be considered as the fundamental characteristic parameter of the engine. This is the
only parameter that changes its optimal value according to the engine operation conditions. The

remaining parameters maintain their optimal value independently of the operation condition of the
engine.

Finally, the above mentioned criteria could be applied and extended to other models of irre-

versible engines [6]. Further work is underway.

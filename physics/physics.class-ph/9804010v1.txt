In the sixties Ogievetskii and Polubarinov proposed the con-
cept of a notoph, whose helicity properties are complementary
to those of a photon. We analyze the theory of antisymmet-
ric tensor ﬁelds in the view of the normalization problem. The
obtained result is that it is possible to describe both photon
and notoph degrees of freedom on the basis of the modiﬁed
Bargmann-Wigner formalism for the symmetric second-rank
spinor. Physical consequences are discussed.

In a recent series of the papers [1–5], which are the continuation of the
Ahluwalia et al work [6–8] we tried to construct a self-consistent theory
of the quantized antisymmetric tensor (AST) ﬁeld of the second rank and
[9–14], as well as text-
of the 4-vector ﬁeld. Previous published works
books [15–18] can not be considered as the works which solved the main
problems, whether the quantized AST ﬁeld and the quantized 4-vector ﬁeld
are transverse or longitudinal ﬁelds (in the sense if the helicity h = ±1 or
h = 0)? can the electromagnetic potential be a 4-vector in a quantized
theory (cf. [19, p.251])? how should the massless limit be taken? and many
other fundamental problems. The most rigorous works are refs. [20–22,19],
but it is not easy to extract corresponding answers even from them. A
lot of problems of rigorous description of the light is still opened. Ideas of
this paper are based on three referee reports from “Foundation of Physics”,
which were very useful even though critical ones.

First of all, we note after the referee that 1) “...In natural units
(c = ¯h = 1) ... a lagrangian density, since the action is dimensionless,
has dimension of [energy]4”; 2) One can always renormalize the lagrangian
density and “one can obtain the same equations of motion... by substitut-
ing L → (1/M N )L, where M is an arbitrary energy scale”, cf. [3]; 3) the
right physical dimension of the ﬁeld strength tensor F µν is [energy]2; “the
transformation F µν → (1/2m)F µν [which was regarded in ref. [5]] ... re-
quires a more detailed study ... [because] the transformation above changes
its physical dimension:
it is not a simple normalization transformation”.
Furthermore, in the ﬁrst papers on the notoph [10–12]1 the authors used
the normalization of the 4-vector F µ ﬁeld2 to [energy]2 and, hence, the
antisymmetric tensor “potentials” Aµν, to [energy]1.

After taking into account these observations let us repeat the proce-
dure of the derivations of the Proca equations from the Bargmann-Wigner

1It is also known as a longitudinal Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld, but the consideration of

Ogievetskii and Polubarinov seems to me to be more rigorous because it permits

to study the m → 0 procedure.

Matrices γµ are chosen in the Weyl representation, i.e., γ5 is assumed to be
diagonal. Constants ci are some numerical dimensionless coeﬃcients. The
reﬂection operator R has the properties

RT = −R , R† = R = R−1 ,
R−1γ5R = (γ5)T ,
R−1γµR = −(γµ)T ,
R−1σµνR = −(σµν)T .

[iγµ∂µ − m]αβ Ψ{βγ}(x) = 0 ,
[iγµ∂µ − m]γβ Ψ{αβ}(x) = 0 .

They are necessary for the expansion (1) to be possible in such a form, i.e.,
in order the γµR, σµνR and γ5σµνR to be symmetrical matrices.

The substitution of the above expansion into the Bargmann-Wigner

set [15]

gives us the new “Proca” equations:

cam(∂µAν − ∂νAµ) + cf (∂µFν − ∂νFµ) = icAm2ǫαβµν Aαβ + 2mcF Fµν
cam2Aµ + cf mFµ = icAmǫµναβ∂νAαβ + 2cF ∂νFµν .

(5a)
(5b)

In the case ca = 1, cF = 1
2 and cf = cA = 0 they are reduced to the ordinary
Proca equations.3 In the general case we obtain dynamical equations which
connect the photon, the notoph and their potentials. Divergent (in m →

by corresponding gauge (or Kalb-Ramond gauge) transformations.
It is
well known that the notoph massless ﬁeld is considered to be the pure
longitudinal ﬁeld after one takes into account ∂µAµν = 0. Apart from these
dynamical equations we can obtain the set of constraints by means of the
subtraction of the equations of the Bargmann-Wigner set (instead of the
addition as for (5a,5b)). It reads

The limit m → 0 may be taken for dynamical variables, in the end of
calculations only.

Furthermore, it is logical to introduce the normalization scalar ﬁeld ϕ(x)

and consider the expansion:

cedure m → 0. Probably, in order to avoid this obscure point one may wish

to write the Dirac equations in the form [(iγµ∂µ)/m − 11] ψ(x) = 0 which fol-

lows straightforwardly in the derivation of the Dirac equation on the basis of the

Ryder-Burgard relation [7] and the Wigner rules for boosting the ﬁeld function

from the zero-momentum frame.

to the set of the Proca equations. The additional constraints are

F µν = 0 .

At the moment it is not yet obvious how can we account for other equa-
tions in the (1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1) representation, e.g. [7b]. One can wish to seek
the generalization of the Proca set on the basis of the introduction of two
mass parameters m1 and m2. But, when we apply the BW procedure to the
Dirac equation we cannot obtain new physical content. Another equation
in the (1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2) representation was obtained in ref. [23]. It has the
form:

Ψ(x) = 0 .

The Bargmann-Wigner procedure for the set of this kind of equations (which
include the γ5 matrix in the mass term) yields:

In fact, the results of this paper develop the old results of ref. [10].
We returned to this question due to recent interpretational controversies in

claims of experimental observations of the objects E ×E∗ and A ×A∗ in the
non-linear optics [24].4 In this connection one can consider that ∼ A × A∗
term can be regarded as the part of antisymmetric tensor potential and
∼ B × B∗, as the part of the 4-vector ﬁeld (cf. the formulas (19a-c) in
ref. [5]). According to [10, Eqs.(9,10)] we proceed in the construction of the
“potentials” for the notoph as follows:

On using explicit forms for the polarization vectors in the momentum space
(e.g., refs. [19] and [5, formulas(15a,b)]) one obtains

4One can wish to compare the notoph concept with theoretical works of M. W.

Evans et al. [e.g., The Enigmatic Photon, Vols. I-IV, Kluwer Academic Publish-

ers, 1994-97]. It is easy to see from the formulas (9,10) of ref. [10] that the Evans’

proposal is not any novelty. The longitudinal ﬁeld constructed from polariza-

tion vectors is nothing more than the notoph antisymmetric tensor potentials [10,

Eq.(10)]. On the other hand, in the Evans’ B cyclic relations we found that B(3)

ﬁeld is not a part of the antisymmetric tensor due to diﬀerent Lorentz transfor-

mations [4]. While Evans refers often to A × A∗ and E × E∗ (or ∼ B(1) × B(2)) as

the same entities in all cases, this is not so. These Evans’ claims are contradictory

each other in the view of the Lorentz symmetry. While, in my opinion, Evans’

works on the theory of longitudinal modes of electromagnetism are full of errors,

the old work of V. I. Ogievetskii and I. V. Polubarinov shows that one can work

rigorously with these concepts.

i.e., it coincides with the longitudinal components of the antisymmetric
tensor obtained in refs. [7a,Eqs.(2.14,2.17)] and [5, Eqs.(17b,18b)] within
the normalization and diﬀerent forms of the spin basis. The longitudinal
states reduce to zero in the massless case under appropriate choice of the
normalization and only if a j = 1 particle moves along with the third axis
OZ. It is also useful to compare Eq. (15) with the formula (B2) in ref. [8]
in order to realize the correct procedure for taking the massless limit.

Next, the Tam-Happer experiments [25] did not ﬁnd satisfactory expla-
nation in the framework of the ordinary QED (at least, their explanation is
complicated by huge technical calculations). On the other hand, in ref. [26]
the very interesting model has been proposed. It is based on gauging the
Dirac ﬁeld on using the coordinate-dependent parameters αµν(x) in

ψ(x) → ψ′(x′) = Ωψ(x) , Ω = exp

and, thus, the second “photon” was introduced. The compensating 24-
component (in general) ﬁeld Bµ,νλ reduces to the 4-vector ﬁeld as follows
(the notation of [26] is used here):

(17)

As readily seen after the comparison of these formulas with those of
refs. [10–12], the second photon is nothing more than the Ogievetskii-
Polubarinov notoph within the normalization. Parity properties (as well
as its behavior in the massless limit) are dependent not only on the explicit
forms of the momentum-space ﬁeld functions of the (1/2, 1/2) represen-
tation, but also on the properties of corresponding creation/annihilation
operators. Helicity properties depend on the normalization.

Finally, in my opinion, the recent theoretical concepts of action-at-a-
distance reposed by A. E. Chubykalo et al., e.g., ref. [27] and the concept
of ﬂavour-oscillation clocks governed by scalar gravitational potential [28]
should ﬁnd connections with the longitudinal quantum ﬁelds.

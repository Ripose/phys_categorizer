1 Introduction.

1.1 Magnetic traps for neutral particles.

Recently there has been rapid progress in techniques for trapping samples
of neutral atoms at elevated densities and extremely low temperatures. The
development of magnetic and optical traps for atoms has proceeded in parallel
in recent years. While optical methods have proved to be an eﬃcient means
of cooling atoms to temperatures in the microKelvin range, further progress
is limited by interatomic interactions induced by the scattering of photons.
The eﬀort to attain higher densities and lower temperatures has therefore
concentrated on the development of purely magnetic traps[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
Such traps exploit the interaction of the magnetic moment of the atom with
the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld to provide spatial conﬁnement.

Microscopic particles are not the only candidates for magnetic traps. In
fact, a vivid demonstration of trapping large scale objects is the hovering
magnetic top[8, 9, 10]. This ingenues magnetic device, which hovers in mid-
air for about 2 minutes, has been studied recently by several authors [11, 12,
13, 14].

1.2 Qualitative description.

The physical mechanism underlying the operation of magnetic traps is the
adiabatic principle. The common way to describe their operation is in terms
of classical mechanics: As the particle is released into the trap, its magnetic
moment points antiparallel to the magnetization of the magnetic ﬁeld. While
inside the trap, the particle experiences lateral oscillations ωvib which are
slow compared to its precession ωprec. Under this condition the spin of the
particle may be considered as experiencing a slowly rotating magnetic ﬁeld.
Thus, the spin precesses around the local direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
B (adiabatic approximation) and, on the average, its magnetic moment µ
points antiparallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld lines. Hence, the magnetic

In the adiabatic approximation, the spin degree of freedom is rigidly coupled
to the translational degrees of freedom, and is already incorporated in Eq.(1).
Thus, under the adiabatic approximation, the particle may be considered as
having only translational degrees of freedom. When the strength of the mag-
netic ﬁeld possesses a minimum, the eﬀective potential becomes attractive
near that minimum and the whole apparatus acts as a trap. To prevent spin-
ﬂip (Majorana transitions), most magneto-static traps include bias ﬁeld, so
that the eﬀective potential Vef f possesses a nonvanishing minimum.

As mentioned above, the adiabatic approximation holds whenever ωprec ≫
ωvib. As ωprec is inversely proportional to the spin, this inequality can be
satisﬁed provided that the spin of the particle is small enough. If, on the
other hand, the spin of the particle is too large, it cannot respond fast enough
ωvib,
to the changes of the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. In this limit ωprec ≫
the spin has to be considered as ﬁxed in space and, according to Earnshaw’s
theorem[15], becomes unstable against translations.

1.3 The purpose and structure of this paper.

The discussion of magnetic traps in the literature is, almost entirely, done
in terms of classical mechanics. In microscopic systems, however, quantum
eﬀects become dominant, and in these cases quantum mechanics is suited for
the description of the trap. An even more interesting issue is the understand-
ing of how are the classical and quantum descriptions of a given system are
related. In this paper we study, both classically and quantum-mechanically,
the quantitative nature of magnetic traps. To do that, without cluttering
the underlying physics with too much calculations, we devise a simpliﬁed
model for the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld of such traps. We neglect the
eﬀect of interactions between the particles in the trap and so we analyze the
dynamics of a single particle inside the trap. For simplicity, the particle is
considered to have only a single translational degree of freedom.
Its spin
degree of freedom, on the other hand, is taken completely into account.

The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sec.(2) we start by deﬁn-
ing the system we study, together with useful parameters that will be used
throughout this paper. Next, we carry out a classical analysis of the problem
in Sec.(3). Here, we ﬁnd two stationary solutions for the particle inside the
trap. One of them corresponds to a state whose spin is parallel to the direc-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld whereas the other one corresponds to a state whose

3

spin is antiparallel to that direction. When considering the dynamical sta-
bility of these solutions, we ﬁnd that only the antiparallel stationary solution
is stable. We also study the same problem but with viscous friction added,
and arrive at the interesting result that friction destabilizes the system. In
Sec.(4) we reconsider the problem, from a quantum-mechanical point of view.
Here, we also ﬁnd states that refer to parallel and antiparallel orientations of
the spin, one of them being bound while the other one unbounded. In this
case, however, these two states are coupled due to the inhomogeneity of the
ﬁeld and we move on to calculate the lifetime of the bound state. Finally,
in Sec.(5) we compare the results of the classical analysis with these of the
quantum analysis and comment on their implications to practical magnetic
traps.

2 Description of the problem.

We consider a particle of mass m, magnetic moment µ and intrinsic spin S
(aligned with µ) moving in 1D space in an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B
given by

Though this ﬁeld is not divergenceless, it nevertheless possesses a nonzero
minimum of amplitude at the origin, which is the essential part of the trap.
Note also that the direction of the ﬁeld twists ( or curls) as one moves along
the x axis. The Hamiltonian for this system is

where P is the momentum of the particle.

We deﬁne ωprec as the precessional frequency of the particle when it is at
the origin x = 0. Since at that point the magnetic ﬁeld is B =B0ˆz we ﬁnd
that

Next, we deﬁne ωvib as the small-amplitude vibrational frequency of the par-
ticle when it is placed in the adiabatic potential ﬁeld given by

smaller and smaller, the adiabatic approximation becomes more and more
accurate. Note also that K is the only possibility to form a non-dimensional
quantity (up to an arbitrary power) out of all the parameters of the system.
The value of K therefore, completely determines the behavior of the system.

3.1 The stationary solutions.

We denote by ˆn a unit vector in the direction of the spin (and the magnetic

suggests that one of the roots for ω has a positive imaginary part for any
K and hence, the solution is unstable. We concentrate now on the other

for the precessional mode. From Eq.(16) we learn that in the vibrational
mode, the amplitudes of the translational motion of the particle and the
y-component of its spin are large compared to the amplitude of the x-
component of the spin. Furthermore, the ratio (δx0/ǫy,0)vib =
⊥ shows
that the amplitudes δx0 and ǫy,0 are related in such a manner so as to set
the direction of the spin antiparallel to the direction of the local magnetic
ﬁeld. Eq.(17) for the precessional mode tells us that the amplitude of the
translational motion of the particle is negligible, thus in this mode the par-
ticle is essentially ﬁxed. Its spin however, executes a circular motion around
the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld at the origin.

As K is increased, the mode frequencies, given in Eq.(14), change and
this describes the coupling between the translational and the precessional
degrees of freedom.

A stable solution requires that all mode frequencies ω be real. Conse-
quently, stability means that the roots for ω2 are all real and positive. From
Eq.(14) we ﬁnd that this happens when

Fig.(1) shows the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies ω of the
two modes as a function of K. We note that when K < 0.5, the imaginary
parts of both frequencies vanish, indicating a stable solution. The mode with
the lower frequency goes asymptotically to ω
0. This is
the vibrational mode. The mode corresponding to the higher frequency, goes
0. This is the precessional
asymptotically to ω
mode whose frequency, as we mentioned earlier, is inversely proportional to
the spin. When K > 0.5, both solutions for ω2 possess also an imaginary
part and the system becomes unstable.

Using Eq.(19) we conclude that for 0 < K < 0.5, the excitation energy of the
vibrational mode is positive while the excitation energy of the precessional
mode is always negative. At the point K = 0.5, where the two modes coalesce,
the excitation energy vanishes. We will further refer to these observations in
the following section.

where rt and rp are translational and precessional friction coeﬃcients, respec-
tively. The second term in the right-hand side of Eq.(27) is the spin-damping
contributed by the change in the direction of the spin from ˆn to ˆn+dˆn. Since,
by deﬁnition, ˆn is a unit vector, it must point perpendicular to dˆn. Thus,
is the angular velocity associated with the change of ˆn. Since
Ω⊥ =
the direction of Ω⊥ must be perpendicular to both dˆn and ˆn we form the
(dˆn/dt) which incorporates both the correct value
cross product Ω⊥ = ˆn
and the right direction. Multiplying Ω⊥ by rp yields spin-damping term.

to make the expression simple. Let ωn,0 be the eigenfrequencies ωn of the
frictionless problem, given by Eq.(13). When adding small friction to the
problem, the eigenfrequencies will change by a small amount δωn. We ﬁnd
an approximate expression for δωn by expanding Eq.(28) around ωn,0 to ﬁrst
order in δωn and making use of Eq.(13). This gives

Eq.(29) has an interesting consequence: From Eq.(19) we ﬁnd that the
numerator in Eq.(29) is positive for both modes while the denominator is neg-
ative for the vibrational mode and positive for the precessional mode. We
therefore conclude that friction, either translational or precessional, stabilizes
the vibrational motion and, simultaneously, destabilizes the precessional mo-
tion. The system all together becomes of course, unstable.

The fact that spin damping leads to an exponential growth of the fast
mode is no surprise in view of its negative excitation energy. Also, the expo-
nential decay of the slow mode due to translational friction is to be expected
on account of its positive excitation energy. What is important is the fact
that due to the coupling between translation and precession, translational
friction causes an exponential growth of the fast mode, with a growth time
which, compared to the eﬀect of spin damping, is smaller by a factor of K 2
in the limit of small K.

4 Quantum-mechanical analysis.

4.1 The Hamiltonian and its diagonalized form.

In this section we consider the problem of a neutral particle with spin S = ~/2
in a 1D inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld from a quantum-mechanical point of
view. Unlike the classical analysis, in which the derivation was valid for any
value of the adiabaticity parameter K, we concentrate here on the behavior
of the system when K is small. We choose to analyze the case of a spin
half particle because this case already shows the essentials of the quantum-
mechanical problem.

Now, it is convenient to express the dependence of the magnetic ﬁeld on
x in terms of its amplitude B(x) and its direction θ(x) with respect to the ˆz

11

axis. Thus, Eq.(2) is rewritten as

where

In order to diagonalize the magnetic part of the Hamiltonian, we make a
local passive transformation of coordinates on the wave function such that the
spinor is expressed in a new coordinate system whose ˆz axis coincides with the

transformation and set Ψ′ = RΨ. Thus, Ψ′ represent the same direction of
the spin as before the transformation but using the new coordinate system.
The Hamiltonian in this newly deﬁned system is clearly given by RHR−1.
In the case of the magnetic ﬁeld given in Eq.(30), the required operation is

4.2.2 Stationary spin-up states.

(cid:16)

Eq.(43) describes a particle in a repulsive potential.
It corresponds to an
unbounded state representing an untrapped particle. In this case there is a
continuum of states, each with its own energy. As we are interested in non-
radiative decay, we focus on ﬁnding a solution with an energy which is equal
to the energy found for the trapped state, that is

E↑ = E↓ ≃

µB0.

(51)

Since Hdiag is symmetric under x
x, to each energy in the continuous
→ −
spectrum there belongs one state with even parity and one state with odd
parity. Further, Hint connects states with opposite parity only. Therefore,
since the spin-down ground state is even in x, we need the spin-down state
with odd parity.

When evaluating the lifetime in the next section, we compute the matrix
element of Hint between the states ψ↑(x) and ψ↓(x). Thus, most of the contri-
bution to this integral comes from the region in x where ψ↓(x) is substantial.
According to Eq.(48), µB(x) changes very little in this range and, as a ﬁrst
approximation, we may take the potential in this region as uniform,

To evaluate the lifetime Tesc of the particle in its trapped state, which is the

according to Fermi’s golden rule[19]. Thus,

larger than ∆x↓ and the function ∂ψ↑/∂x which is a periodic function with
a characteristic period ∆x↑ which is √K smaller than ∆x↓. This suggests
that we can approximate the integral in Eq.(59) by substituting dθ/dx for
its value at x = 0,

compared to ∆xµB. In this case, the uniform potential approximation still
holds, and we may use the well-known result for the density of states for a

Looking back at the calculation of the matrix element, Eq.(61), one re-
alizes that for small K the wave function ψ↑ oscillates strongly in the region
where the wave function ψ↓ is essentially diﬀerent from zero. Thus, successive
subintervals compensate each other very eﬀectively, and it is possible that
> ∆x↓ where the x-dependence of the potential becomes im-
the regions
portant, contribute more eﬀectively to the integral than the simple estimates
indicate. We have therefore carried out a more accurate calculation, using
the WKB approximation[18], which takes the x-dependence of the potential
into account. The calculation, which is given in the Appendix, yields the

5 Discussion.

Summarizing all we have found we conclude that the problem we have studied
has three important time scales: The shortest time scale is Tprec, which is
the time required for one precession of the spin around the axis of the local
magnetic ﬁeld. The intermediate time scale is Tvib = Tprec/K, which is the
time required to complete one cycle of the center of mass around the center
of the trap. These two time scales appear both in the classical and the
quantum-mechanical analysis. The longest time scale (provided K is small)
Tesc, which is not present at the classical problem, is the time it takes for the
particle to escape from the trap.

Whereas the classical analysis yields an upper bound of K = 0.5 for
trapping to occur, no such sharp bound exists in the quantum-mechanical
analysis. This is related to the fact that one cannot associate an eﬀective po-
tential well with a ﬁnite barrier with the system. Nevertheless it is interesting
to compare the classical bound with the value of K for which the exponent
in the expression for the quantum-mechanical lifetime becomes equal to 1:

19

For the uniform-ﬁeld approximation, Eq.(66), the two values happen to agree
exactly, and in the WKB approximation, Eq.(67), they diﬀer only by a small
amount. Thus, the quantum-mechanical condition for trapping to occur is
essentially the same as the classical condition.

As an example, we apply our results to the case of a neutron and an atom
trapped with a ﬁeld B0 = 100 Oe and B0/B′
⊥ = 10cm. These parameters cor-
respond to typical traps used in Bose-Einstein condensation experiments[7].
The results, being correct to within an order of magnitude, are outlined in
the following table:

We note that in both cases K is much smaller than 1. Also, the calculated

particle (either neutron or atom) is tightly trapped in this ﬁeld.

exp [2/K 3].

Though the toy model presented in this paper is very simple, preliminary
studies[21] show that behavior similar to what we found in this model trap
appears also in more realistic magnetic traps such as those used in Bose-
Einstein condensation experiments. For example, a similar analysis of a two-
dimensional Ioﬀee trap[2] shows similar behavior when the classical analysis
and quantum-mechanical analysis are compared, but in this case we ﬁnd that
Tesc ∼
The problem studied in this paper deals with a spin 1/2 particle. Though
this fact has little inﬂuence on the solution of the classical problem, the
extension to higher spin values complicates the analysis of the quantum-
mechanical problem. In this case one has to deal with a (2S + 1)-component

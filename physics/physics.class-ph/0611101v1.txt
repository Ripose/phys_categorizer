Abstract— We consider resonant patch antennas, implemented
using loaded transmission-line networks and other exotic struc-
tures having engineered dispersion. An analytical expression is
derived for the ratio of radiation quality factors of such an-
tennas and conventional patch antennas loaded with (reference)
dielectrics. In the ideal case this ratio depends only on the
propagation constant and wave impedance of the structure under
test, and it can be conveniently used to study what kind of
dispersion leads to improved impedance bandwidth. We illustrate
the effect of dispersion by implementing a resonant patch
antenna using a periodic network of LC elements. The analytical
results predicting enhanced impedance bandwidth compared to
the reference results are validated using a commercial circuit
simulator. Discussion is conducted on the practical limitations
for the use of the proposed expression.

I. INTRODUCTION

Size reduction of patch antennas using different materials
ﬁlling the volume under the antenna element is a classical
miniaturization technique [1]. Typically, conventional dielec-
tric substrates have been used to decrease the physical di-
mensions of the radiator, and it is known that the impedance
bandwidth decreases roughly inversely with increasing the
effective permittivity of the substrate (with a ﬁxed substrate
height) [2]. It has been observed, however, that increase of
the effective substrate permeability has only a small effect on
the bandwidth, if the permeability is assumed to be lossless
and dispersion-free [2], [3]. This observation has lead to a
ﬂow of research concerning patch antenna miniaturization
using magnetodielectric substrates, e.g. [4]– [6]. Recently,
also several other exotic materials have been proposed for
size reduction: For example, authors of [7] proposed to use
a reactive impedance substrate, and authors of [8], [9] studied
miniaturization using double-negative metamaterials.

From the commonly used transmission-line (TL) represen-
tation of a patch antenna [1] it is clear that the purpose of
different loading materials is to optimize the input susceptance
seen at the antenna terminal, while maintaining the radiation
conductance at a reasonable level. If the antenna geome-
the dispersion
try leaves the radiation conductance intact,
characteristics of the loading material solely determine the
impedance bandwidth performance of the antenna under test

(AUT) compared to the performance of the same-size refer-
ence antenna, miniaturized using normal dielectrics. Authors
of [5], [6] derived an analytical expression for the ratio of
radiation quality factors (Qrel
r ) of the above referred antennas
(resonant AUT and the reference antenna), and used this
ratio as a ﬁgure of merit to test the suitability of different
materials in efﬁcient antenna miniaturization. Qrel
r derived in
[5], [6] is solely a function of the effective AUT (substrate)
material parameters, and it can be used when the material is
homogeneous and it is meaningful to assign effective material
parameters (for other criteria, please see [6]).

Recently, there have been suggestions to manipulate the
dispersion characteristics of patch antennas by implementing
the actual antennas as periodic networks of LC elements
[10]– [12]. The aim has been to reduce the resonant length
by synthesizing large propagation constants for the network.
One interesting related idea would be to synthesize a network
whose wave impedance and propagation constant resemble
those of weakly dispersive high-permeability materials. If the
implemented LC network comprising the antenna would still
allow effective radiation (the radiation conductance would not
deteriorate due to implementation details), one could possibly
beneﬁt from the advantages of magnetic loading [3] and
weaken the strong “negative” effect of frequency dispersion
[5]. This expectation follows from the important fact that
the performance of the network is not based on resonant
inclusions.

To be able to synthesize the desired dispersion characteris-
tics for the network it would be convenient to have a ﬁgure of
merit that would immediately tell if the proposed dispersion
allows the realization of a wider impedance bandwidth than
reference dielectrics. If the unit cell dimension is not very
small, it might be more meaningful to characterize the network
using its effective propagation constant and wave impedance,
rather than the extracted material parameters [13]. Thus, Qrel
proposed in [5], [6] might not be directly applicable. Here
we derive a ﬁgure of merit, similar to that in [5], [6], but
expressed as a function of the effective wave impedance and
propagation constant of the structure/material under test. This
ﬁgure of merit is used to design a patch antenna with enhanced
impedance bandwidth compared to the reference antenna using
a periodic network of LC elements.

[6] integrated the ﬁeld energy density over the volume of the
antenna, and further applied standard deﬁnitions to calculate
the quality factors using stored electromagnetic energy and
radiated power.

Let us in the following assume that m = 1 and we can
assign effective material parameters for the tested material.

and after differentiating the propagation constant we get the

2) Comments related to the practical use of eq. (10): When
deriving eq. (11) authors of [5], [6] assumed that m = 1
since the considered antennas had the same-size continuous
metal plates acting as antenna elements, and the classical
assumption according to which the width of the radiating edge
predominantly determines the radiation conductance [1], was
used. However, in the real antenna implementations based
on LC element networks the actual (realizable) radiation
properties might not be so easily predicted by standard TL-
expressions: Authors of [10] observed that the power delivered
to the furthermost radiating slot was 2 dB lower than the
power delivered to the ﬁrst slot. In addition to this, parasitic
radiation from the inductors (affecting the fringing ﬁeld) was
reported. Later authors of [11] presented an empirical formula
to estimate the radiation conductance of antennas based on

with a certain low-loss material. The TL-representation of the
antenna is shown in Fig. 1. Using standard TL-equations we
can write the input admittance of the antenna in the following
form:

Yin = G +

G[1 + j Y
1 + j G

G tan(βl)]
Y tan(βl)

,

(1)

where Y = 1/Z is the characteristic admittance of the
equivalent TL, G is the radiation conductance, and β is
the equivalent propagation constant of the antenna segment.
When the antenna operates close to its fundamental (parallel)
π), tan(βl) has a very small value. Thus,
resonance (βl
after applying Taylor expansion to the denominator of (1) we
can write the input admittance in the following approximate
form:

Typically the height of a resonant patch is a small fraction
of the wavelength and noticeably smaller than the width
of the antenna. By applying standard expressions, typically
used to estimate the characteristic admittance and radiation
conductance [1], we observe that Y 2

LC-networks, and an expression to estimate the maximum
achievable bandwidth. Authors of [12] reported rather low
radiation efﬁciencies, and speculated that the low efﬁciencies
were due to large currents concentrated near vias implemented
as lossy conductors. In this case the standing wave pattern on
the antenna element might not be anymore a pure sin-function
as in a normal patch. This has a natural implication on the
radiated power since most of the radiation should still happen
due to fringing ﬁelds (represented as a conductance sitting at
the patch edge where maximum of voltage should occur).

Due to the above uncertainties that depend highly on the
particular implementation details, and the empirical expression
for G found in [11], we assume in the following generally
that m
1. With this assumption we are able to study the
dispersion characteristics of the tested structures/materials sep-
arately from the radiation properties. If the proposed dispersion
is desirable, one should still before the ﬁnal implementation
make sure that the antenna radiates properly.

III. EXAMPLE OF APPLICATION: PATCH ANTENNA
IMPLEMENTED AS AN LC NETWORK

In this section we synthesize the performance of a com-
pact patch antenna using a periodical arrangement of loaded
transmission-lines, Fig. 2. We use eq. (10) to choose practi-
cally realizable network parameters so that Qrel
goes below
unity, i.e. the TL-antenna is more wideband than the same-
size reference antenna. It is assumed that m = 1 since we
cannot at this stage readily predict the inﬂuence of the practical
realization to the equivalent radiation conductance or voltage
wave pattern.

r

The Bloch impedance ZB and propagation constant β in
the one-dimensional (1D) line are calculated using the design
equations available in [15]. Similarly as in [16] we relate
the Bloch impedance to the effective wave impedance in the
equivalent homogeneous line:

ZB,

Zw =

p
h
where p is the unit cell period and h is the height of the
(network) substrate. With the help of eq. (10) we choose the
following parameters (notations are clear from Fig. 2): p = 5
mm, h = 2 mm, Z TL = 200 Ω, ǫTL
r = 2.33, CL = 200 pF,
LL = 100 nH.

The equivalent propagation constant and wave impedance in
the homogenized 1D line are shown in Figs. 3,4, respectively.

The relative radiation quality factor [eq. (10)] is shown in
Fig. 5. We can see that Qrel
is below unity over a wide
frequency band when the antenna operates in the right-hand
branch (forward wave) of the dispersion curve. Initial sim-
ulations with different TL-structures1 have shown that the
effective permeability is high and weakly dispersive only in the
right-hand branch. This is reﬂected also in the result depicted
in Fig. 5, which resembles the result obtained using weakly
dispersive magnetic materials under the antenna element [5],
[6].

The designed antenna has length l = 7

p = 35 mm and
p = 40 mm (see the schematic illustration in

IV. CONCLUSION

We have derived an explicit expression for the ratio of
radiation quality factors of resonant patch antennas, 1) im-
plemented using structures having engineered dispersion and
2) loaded with conventional dielectrics. This expression allows
to study conveniently what kind of dispersion leads to efﬁcient
size reduction. As an example, a patch antenna with desirable
dispersion characteristics has been implemented using a peri-
odical network of LC elements.

The inductors and capacitors have been removed from the last
periods near the radiating edges to minimize their effect on
the fringing ﬁelds. We use data in Figs. 3, 4 to calculate
the reﬂection coefﬁcient for the TL-antenna using the TL-
model introduced in [5], [6]. The calculation is repeated for
a reference antenna loaded with dispersion-free dielectrics. In
the TL-model, a short section of empty TL is left near the
radiating edges to reﬂect the absence of bulk components (the
same empty space is left in the reference calculation). In the
calculations l′ = p, and w′ has been varied to tune the quality
of matching to be the same with both antennas.

The results of calculations are depicted in Fig. 7. We
have also implemented the TL-antenna in the Agilent ADS
circuit simulator (no reference antenna simulations have been
performed since the quantitative accuracy of the TL-model
for this case has been demonstrated earlier [6]). Radiation
has been modeled both in the TL-model and in ADS by an
equivalent radiation conductance G = Gref = 1/90(w/λ0)2
[1], see Fig. 1. Qrel
calculated from the reﬂection data is
0.66, whereas eq. (10) gives 0.69. The result predicted by
ADS closely agrees with the TL-result (with a ﬁxed G) and
validates the feasibility of the proposed network (dispersion)
in antenna miniaturization. We have to bear in mind, however,
that in the practical LC network implementation the radiation
might be weaker [10], [12] than predicted by the standard
expressions for G given in [1]. This effect is, however, highly
dependent on the implementation details.

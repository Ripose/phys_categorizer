On Symplectic Reduction in Classical Mechanics

J. Butterﬁeld1

All Souls College
Oxford OX1 4AL

Abstract

Thursday 21 July 2005; a Chapter of The North Holland Handbook of Philosophy of
Physics

This Chapter expounds the modern theory of symplectic reduction in ﬁnite-
dimensional Hamiltonian mechanics. This theory generalizes the well-known con-
nection between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities, i.e. Noether’s
theorem. It also illustrates one of mechanics’ grand themes: exploiting a sym-
metry so as to reduce the number of variables needed to treat a problem. The
exposition emphasises how the theory provides insights about the rotation group
and the rigid body. The theory’s device of quotienting a state space also casts
light on philosophical issues about whether two apparently distinct but utterly
indiscernible possibilities should be ruled to be one and the same. These issues
are illustrated using “relationist” mechanics.

Mottoes

The current vitality of mechanics, including the investigation of fundamental questions,
is quite remarkable, given its long history and development. This vitality comes about
through rich interactions with pure mathematics (from topology and geometry to group
representation theory), and through new and exciting applications to areas like control
theory. It is perhaps even more remarkable that absolutely fundamental points, such
as a clear and unambiguous linking of Lie’s work on the Lie-Poisson bracket on the
dual of a Lie algebra ... with the most basic of examples in mechanics, such as the
rigid body and the motion of ideal ﬂuids, took nearly a century to complete.

Marsden and Ratiu (1999, pp. 431-432).

In the ordinary theory of the rigid body, six diﬀerent three-dimensional spaces IR3, IR3∗, g,
g∗, T Gg, T ∗Gg are identiﬁed.
Arnold (1989, p. 324).

1 Introduction

1.1 Why classical mechanics?

All hail the rise of modern physics! Between 1890 and 1930, the quantum and rela-
tivity revolutions and the consolidation of statistical physics through the discovery of
atoms, utterly transformed our understanding of nature; and had an enormous inﬂu-
ence on philosophy; (e.g. Kragh 1999; Ryckman 2005). Accordingly, this Handbook
concentrates on those three pillars of modern physics—quantum theories, spacetime
theories and thermal physics. So some initial explanation of the inclusion of a Chapter
on classical mechanics, indeed the classical mechanics of ﬁnite-dimensional systems, is
in order.

The ﬁrst point to make is that the various ﬁelds of classical physics, such as mechan-
ics and optics, are wonderfully rich and deep, not only in their technicalities, but also
in their implications for the philosophy and foundations of physics. From Newton’s
time onwards, classical mechanics and optics have engendered an enormous amount
of philosophical reﬂection. As regards mechanics, the central philosophical topics are
usually taken (and have traditionally been taken) to be space, time, determinism and
the action-at-a-distance nature of Newtonian gravity. Despite their importance, I will
not discuss these topics; but some other Chapters will do so (at least in part, and
sometimes in connection with theories other than classical mechanics). I will instead
focus on the theory of symplectic reduction, which develops the well-known connection
between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities, summed up in Noether’s
I choose this focus partly by way of preparation for parts of some
“ﬁrst theorem”.
other Chapters; and partly because, as we will see in a moment, symplectic reduction
plays a central role in the current renaissance of classical mechanics, and in its relation
to quantum physics.

I said that classical physics engendered a lot of philosophical reﬂection. It is worth
stressing two, mutually related, reasons for this: reasons which today’s philosophical
emphasis on the quantum and relativity revolutions tends to make us forget.

First: in the two centuries following Newton, these ﬁelds of classical physics were
transformed out of all recognition, so that the framework for philosophical reﬂection
about them also changed. Think of how in the nineteenth century, classical mechanics
and optics gave rise to classical ﬁeld theories, especially electromagnetism. And within
this Chapter’s speciﬁc ﬁeld, the classical mechanics of ﬁnite-dimensional systems, think
of how even its central theoretical principles were successively recast, in fundamental
ways, by ﬁgures such Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi.

Second, various diﬃcult problems beset the attempt to rigorously formulate classi-
cal mechanics and optics; some of which have considerable philosophical aspects. It is
not true that once we set aside the familiar war-horse topics—space, time, determinism
and action-at-a-distance—the world-picture of classical mechanics is straightforward:
just “matter in motion”. On the contrary. Even if we consider only ﬁnite-dimensional

4

systems, we can ask, for example:

(i) For point-particles (material points): can they have diﬀerent masses, and if
so how? What happens when they collide? Indeed, for point-particles interacting only
by Newtonian gravity, a collision involves inﬁnite kinetic energy.

(ii) For extended bodies treated as ﬁnite-dimensional because rigid: what hap-
pens when they collide? Rigidity implies that forces, and displacements, are transmit-
ted “inﬁnitely fast” through the body. Surely that should not be taken literally? But
if so, what justiﬁes this idealization; and what are its scope and limits?

As to inﬁnite-dimensional systems (elastic solids, ﬂuids and ﬁelds), many parts of
their theories remain active research areas, especially as regards rigorous formulations
and results. For contemporary work on elastic solids, for example, cf. Marsden and
Hughes (1982). As to ﬂuids, the existence and uniqueness of rigorous solutions of the
main governing equations, the Navier-Stokes equations, is still an open problem. This
problem not only has an obvious bearing on determinism; it is regarded as scientiﬁ-
cally signiﬁcant enough that its solution would secure a million-dollar Clay Millennium
prize.

These two reasons—the successive reformulations of classical mechanics, and its
philosophical problems—are of course related. The monumental ﬁgures of classical
mechanics recognized and debated the problems, and much of their technical work
was aimed at solving them. As a result, there was a rich debate about the founda-
tions of classical physics, in particular mechanics, for the two centuries after Newton’s
Principia (1687). A well-known example is Duhem’s instrumentalist philosophy of
science, which arose in large measure from his realization how hard it was to secure
rigorous foundations at the microscopic level for classical mechanics. A similar exam-
ple is Hilbert’s being prompted by his contemporaries’ continuing controversies about
the foundations of mechanics, to choose as the sixth of his famous list of outstand-
ing mathematical problems, the axiomatization of mechanics and probability; (but for
some history of this list, cf. Grattan-Guinness (2000)). A third example, spanning
both centuries, concerns variational principles: the various principles of least action
formulated ﬁrst by Maupertuis, then by Euler and later ﬁgures—ﬁrst for ﬁnite classi-
cal mechanical systems, then for inﬁnite ones—prompted much discussion of teleology.
Indeed, this discussion ensnared the logical empiricists (St¨oltzner 2003); it also bears
on contemporary philosophy of modality (Butterﬁeld 2004).

In the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, the quantum and relativity revolutions
tended to distract physicists, and thereby philosophers, from these and similar prob-
lems. The excitement of developing the new theories, and of debating their implications
for natural philosophy, made it understandable, even inevitable, that the foundational
problems of classical mechanics were ignored.

Besides, this tendency was strengthened by the demands of pedagogy: the neces-
sity of including the new theories in physics undergraduate degrees. By mid-century,
the constraints of time on the physics curriculum had led many physics undergradu-
ates’ education in classical mechanics to ﬁnish with the elementary parts of analytical

5

mechanics, especially of ﬁnite-dimensional systems:
for example, with the material
in Goldstein’s well-known textbook (1950). Such a restriction is understandable, not
least because: (i) the elementary theory of Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s equations re-
quires knowledge of ordinary diﬀerential equations, and (ii) elementary Hamiltonian
mechanics forms a springboard to learning elementary canonical quantization (as does
Hamilton-Jacobi theory, from another perspective). Besides, as I mentioned: even this
restricted body of theory provides plenty of material for philosophical analysis—witness
my examples above, and the discussions of the great ﬁgures such Euler, Lagrange,
Hamilton and Jacobi.

However, the second half of the twentieth century saw a renaissance in research in
classical mechanics: hence my ﬁrst motto. There are four obvious reasons for this: the
ﬁrst two “academic”, and the second two “practical”.

(i): Thanks partly to developments in mathematics in the decades after Hilbert’s
list of problems, the foundational questions were addressed afresh, as much by math-
ematicians and mathematically-minded engineers as by physicists. The most relevant
developments lay in such ﬁelds as topology, diﬀerential geometry, measure theory and
functional analysis. In this revival, the contributions of the Soviet school, always strong
in mechanics and probability, were second to none. And relatedly:—

(ii): The quest to deepen the formulation of quantum theory, especially quantum
ﬁeld theory, prompted investigation of (a) the structure of classical mechanics and (b)
quantization. For both (a) and (b), special interest attaches to the generally much
harder case of inﬁnite systems.

(iii): The coming of spaceﬂight, which spurred the development of celestial mechan-

(iv): The study of non-linear dynamics (“chaos theory”), which was spurred by the

ics. And relatedly:—

invention of computers.

With these diverse causes and aspects, this renaissance continues to ﬂourish—and
accordingly, I shall duck out of trying to further adumbrate it! I shall even duck out
of trying to survey the philosophical questions that arise from the various formulations
of mechanics from Newton to Jacobi and Poincar´e. Suﬃce it to say here that to the
various topics mentioned above, one could add, for example, the following two: the
ﬁrst broadly ontological, the second broadly epistemological.

(a): The analysis of notions such as mass and force (including how they change
over time). For this topic, older books include Jammer (1957, 1961) and McMullin
(1978); recent books include Boudri (2002), Jammer (2000), Lutzen (2005) and Slovik
(2002); and Grattan-Guinness (2006) is a ﬁne recent synopsis of the history, with many
references.

(b): The analysis of what it is to have an explicit solution of a mechanical problem
(including how the notion of explicit solution was gradually generalized). This topic is
multi-faceted. It not only relates to the gradual generalization of the notion of function
(a grand theme in the history of mathematics—well surveyed by Lutzen 2003), and
to modern non-linear dynamics (cf. (iv) above). It also relates to the simpliﬁcation
of problems by exploiting a symmetry so as to reduce the number of variables one

6

needs—and this is the core idea of symplectic reduction. I turn to introducing it.

1.2 Prospectus

The strategy of simplifying a mechanical problem by exploiting a symmetry so as
to reduce the number of variables is one of classical mechanics’ grand themes. It is
theoretically deep, practically important, and recurrent in the history of the subject.
The best-known general theorem about the strategy is undoubtedly Noether’s theo-
rem, which describes a correspondence between continuous symmetries and conserved
quantities. There is both a Lagrangian and a Hamiltonian version of this theorem,
though for historical reasons the name ‘Noether’s theorem’ is more strongly attached
to the Lagrangian version. However, we shall only need the Hamiltonian version of the
theorem: it will be the “springboard” for our exposition of symplectic reduction.2

So I shall begin by brieﬂy reviewing the Hamiltonian version in Section 2.1. For
the moment, suﬃce it to make four comments (in ascending order of importance for
what follows):

(i): Both versions are underpinned by the theorems in elementary Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian mechanics about cyclic (ignorable) coordinates and their corresponding
conserved momenta.3

(ii): In fact, the Hamiltonian version of the theorem is stronger. This reﬂects the
fact that the canonical transformations form a “larger” group than the point trans-
formations. A bit more precisely: though the point transformations q → q′ on the
conﬁguration space Q induce canonical transformations on the phase space Γ of the qs
and ps, q → q′, p → p′ , there are yet other canonical transformations which “mix” the
qs and ps in ways that transformations induced by point transformations do not.

(iii): I shall limit our discussion to (a) time-independent Hamiltonians and (b)
time-independent transformations. Agreed, analytical mechanics can be developed, in
both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks, while allowing time-dependent dynam-
ics and transformations. For example, in the Lagrangian framework, allowing velocity-
2For discussion of the Lagrangian version, cf. e.g. Brading and Castellani (this vol., ch. 13)
or (restricted to ﬁnite-dimensional systems) Butterﬁeld (2004a: Section 4.7). For an exposition of
both versions that is complementary to this paper (and restricted to ﬁnite-dimensional systems), cf.
Butterﬁeld (2006). Brading and Castellani also bring out that, even apart from Noether’s theorems
in other branches of mathematics, there are other ‘Noether’s theorems’ about symmetries in classical
dynamics; so the present theorem is sometimes called Noether’s “ﬁrst theorem”. Note also (though I
shall not develop this point) that symplectic structure can be seen in the classical solution space of
Lagrange’s equations, so that symplectic reduction can be developed in the Lagrangian framework;
cf. e.g. Marsden and Ratiu (1999: p. 10, Sections 7.2-7.5, and 13.5).

3Here we glimpse the long history of our subject: these theorems were of course clear to these
subjects’ founders. Indeed the strategy of exploiting a symmetry to reduce the number of variables
occurs already in 1687, in Newton’s solution of the Kepler problem; (or more generally, the problem
of two bodies exerting equal and opposite forces along the line between them). The symmetries are
translations and rotations, and the corresponding conserved quantities are the linear and angular
momenta. In what follows, these symmetries and quantities will provide us with several examples.

7

dependent potentials and-or time-dependent constraints would prompt one to use what
is often called the ‘extended conﬁguration space’ Q×IR. And in the Hamiltonian frame-
work, time-dependence prompts one to use an ‘extended phase space’ Γ × IR. Besides,
from a philosophical viewpoint, it is important to consider time-dependent transfor-
mations: for they include boosts, which are central to the philosophical discussion of
spacetime symmetry groups, and especially of relativity principles. But beware: rough-
and-ready statements about symmetry, e.g. that the Hamiltonian must be invariant
under a symmetry transformation, are liable to stumble on these transformations. To
give the simplest example: the Hamiltonian of a free particle is just its kinetic energy,
which can be made zero by transforming to the particle’s rest frame; i.e.
it is not
invariant under boosts.

So a full treatment of symmetry in Hamiltonian mechanics, and thereby of sym-
plectic reduction, needs to treat time-dependent transformations—and to beware! But
I will set aside all these complications. Here it must suﬃce to assert, without any
details, that the modern theory of symplectic reduction does cope with boosts; and
more generally, with time-dependent dynamics and transformations.

(iv): As we shall see in detail, there are three main ways in which the theory of
symplectic reduction generalizes Noether’s theorem. As one might expect, these three
ways are intimately related to one another.

(a): Noether’s theorem is “one-dimensional” in the sense that for each sym-
metry (a vector ﬁeld of a special kind on the phase space), it provides a conserved
quantity, i.e. a real-valued function on the phase space, whose value stays constant
over time. So in particular, diﬀerent components of a conserved vector quantity, such
as total linear momentum, are treated separately; (in this example, the corresponding
vector ﬁelds generate translations in three diﬀerent spatial directions). But in sym-
plectic reduction, the notion of a momentum map provides a “uniﬁed” description of
these diﬀerent components.

(b): Given a symmetry, Noether’s theorem enables us to conﬁne our attention
to the level surface of the conserved quantity, i.e. the sub-manifold of phase space on
which the quantity takes its initial value: for the system’s time-evolution is conﬁned
to that surface. In that sense, the number of variables we need to consider is reduced.
But in symplectic reduction, we go further and form a quotient space from the phase
space. That is, in the jargon of logic: we deﬁne on phase space an equivalence relation
(not in general so simple as having a common value for a conserved quantity) and form
the set of equivalence classes. In the jargon of group actions: we form the set of orbits.
Passage to this quotient space can have various good technical, and even philosophi-
cal, motivations. And under good conditions, this set is itself a manifold with lower
dimension.

(c): Hamiltonian mechanics, and so Noether’s theorem, is usually formulated
in terms of symplectic manifolds, in particular the cotangent bundle T ∗Q of the con-
ﬁguration space Q. (Section 2.1 will give details.) But in symplectic reduction, we
often need a (mild) generalization of the idea of a symplectic manifold, called a Pois-
son manifold, in which a bracket, with some of the properties of the Poisson bracket,

8

is taken as the primitive notion. Besides, this is related to (b) in that we are often
led to a Poisson manifold, and dynamics on it, by taking the quotient of a symplectic
manifold (i.e. a phase space of the usual kind) by the action of a symmetry group.

As comment (iv) hints, symplectic reduction is a large subject. So there are several
motivations for expounding it. As regards physics, many of the ideas and results can
be developed for ﬁnite-dimensional classical systems (to which I will conﬁne myself),
but then generalized to inﬁnite-dimensional systems. And in either the original or the
generalized form, they underpin developments in quantum theories. So these ideas and
results have formed part of the contemporary renaissance in classical mechanics; cf. (i)
and (ii) at the end of Section 1.1.

As regards philosophy, symmetry is both a long-established focus for philosophi-
cal discussion, and a currently active one: cf. Brading and Castellani (2003). But
philosophical discussion of symplectic reduction seems to have begun only recently,
especially in some papers of Belot and Earman. This delay is presumably because the
technical material is more sophisticated:
indeed, the theory of symplectic reduction
was cast in its current general form only in the 1970s. But as Belot and Earman em-
phasise, the philosophical beneﬁts are worth the price of learning the technicalities.
The most obvious issue is that symplectic reduction’s device of quotienting a state
space casts light on philosophical issues about whether two apparently distinct but
utterly indiscernible possibilities should be ruled to be one and the same. In Section
2, I will follow Belot in illustrating this issue with “relationist” mechanics. Indeed, I
have selected the topics for my exposition with an eye to giving philosophical readers
the background needed for some of Belot’s discussions. His papers (which I will cite
in Section 2) make many judicious philosophical points, without burdening the reader
with an exposition of technicalities: excellent stuﬀ—but to fully appreciate the issues,
one of course has to slog through the details.

Finally, in the context of this volume, symplectic reduction provides some back-
ground for the Chapters on the representation of time in mechanics (Belot, this vol.,
ch. 2), and on the relations between classical and quantum physics (Landsman, this
vol., ch. 5, especially Sections 4.3-4.5 and 6.5; Dickson, this vol., ch. 4).

The plan of the Chapter is as follows. I ﬁrst review Noether’s theorem in Hamil-
tonian mechanics as usually formulated, in Section 2.1. Then I introduce the themes
mentioned in (b) and (c) above, of quotienting a phase space, and Poisson manifolds
(Section 2.2); and illustrate these themes with “relationist” mechanics (Section 2.3).

Thereafter, I expound the basics of symplectic reduction: (conﬁning myself to ﬁnite-
dimensional Hamiltonian mechanics). Section by Section, the plan will be as follows.

motivations for Poisson manifolds (5.1); and then to exhibit examples, and prove some
main properties (Section 5.2 onwards). Section 6 applies this material to symmetry and
conservation in mechanical systems. In particular, it expresses conserved quantities as
momentum maps, and proves Noether’s theorem for Hamiltonian mechanics on Poisson
manifolds. Finally, in Section 7, we prove one of the several main theorems about
symplectic reduction. It concerns the case where the natural conﬁguration space for
a system is itself a Lie group G: this occurs both for the rigid body and ideal ﬂuids.
In this case, quotienting the natural phase space (the cotangent bundle on G) gives a
Poisson manifold that “is” the dual g∗ of G’s Lie algebra.5

To sum up:— The overall eﬀect of this exposition is, I hope, to illustrate this
Chapter’s mottoes: that classical mechanics is alive and kicking, not least through
deepening our understanding of time-honoured systems such as the rigid body—whose
analysis in traditional textbooks can be all too confusing!

2 Symplectic reduction: an overview

We begin by brieﬂy reviewing Hamiltonian mechanics and Noether’s theorem, in Sec-
tion 2.1.6 This prepares us for the idea of symplectic reduction, Section 2.2: which we
then illustrate using “relationist” mechanics, Section 2.3.

2.1 Hamiltonian mechanics and Noether’s theorem: a review

2.1.1 Symplectic manifolds; the cotangent bundle as a symplectic manifold

A symplectic structure or symplectic form on a manifold M is deﬁned to be a diﬀerential
its exterior derivative dω vanishes) and is non-
2-form ω on M that is closed (i.e.
degenerate. That is: for any x ∈ M, and any two tangent vectors at x, σ, τ ∈ Tx:

dω = 0 and ∀ τ 6= 0, ∃σ : ω(τ, σ) 6= 0 .

(2.1)

Such a pair (M, ω) is called a symplectic manifold. There is a rich theory of symplectic
manifolds; but we shall only need a small fragment of it. (In particular, the fact that
we mostly avoid the theory of canonical transformations means we will not need the
theory of Lagrangian sub-manifolds.)

5In this endeavour, my sources are four books by masters of the subject: Abraham and Marsden
(1978), Arnold (1989), Marsden and Ratiu (1999) and Olver (2000). But again, be warned: my
selection is severe, as anyone acquainted with these or similar books will recognize.

6For more details about diﬀerential geometry, cf. Sections 3.1 and 3.2. For more details about
the geometric formulation of mechanics, cf. Arnold (1989) or Marsden and Ratiu (1999); or Singer
(2001) (more elementary than this exposition) or Abraham and Marsden (1978) (more advanced); or
Butterﬁeld (2006) (at the same level). Of many good textbooks of mechanics, I admire especially
Desloge (1982) and Johns (2005).

First, it follows from the non-degeneracy of ω that M is even-dimensional. The
reason lies in a theorem of linear algebra, which one then applies to the tangent space
at each point of M. Namely, for any bilinear form ω : V ×V → IR: if ω is antisymmetric
of rank r ≤ m ≡ dim(V ), then r is even. That is: r = 2n for some integer n, and there
is a basis e1, ..., ei, ..., em of V for which ω has a simple expansion as wedge-products

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

equivalently, ω has the m × m matrix

ω = Σn

i=1 ei ∧ ei+n ;

ω = 



1 0
0
−1 0 0
0 0
0

.





where 1 is the n×n identity matrix, and similarly for the zero matrices of various sizes.
This normal form of antisymmetric bilinear forms is an analogue of the Gram-Schmidt
theorem that an inner product space has an orthonormal basis, and is proved by an
analogous argument.

So if an antisymmetric bilinear form is non-degenerate, then r ≡ 2n = m. That is:
eq. 2.3 loses its bottom row and right column consisting of zero matrices, and reduces
to the 2n × 2n symplectic matrix ω given by

ω :=

0
1
−1 0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

.

Second, the non-degeneracy of ω implies that at any x ∈ M, there is a basis-
x . Namely: for

independent isomorphism ω♭ from the tangent space Tx to its dual T ∗
any x ∈ M and τ ∈ Tx, the value of the 1-form ω♭(τ ) ∈ T ∗
x is deﬁned by

ω♭(τ )(σ) := ω(σ, τ ) ∀σ ∈ Tx .

(2.5)

This also means that a symplectic structure enables a covector ﬁeld, i.e. a diﬀerential
one-form, to determine a vector ﬁeld. Thus for any function H : M → IR, so that dH
is a diﬀerential 1-form on M, the inverse of ω♭ (which we might write as ω♯), carries
dH to a vector ﬁeld on M, written XH . This is the key idea whereby in Hamiltonian
mechanics, a scalar function H determines a dynamics; cf. Section 2.1.2.

So far, we have noted some implications of ω being non-degenerate. The other part
of the deﬁnition of a symplectic form (for a manifold), viz. ω being closed, dω = 0, is
also important. We shall see in Section 2.1.3 that it implies that a vector ﬁeld X on a
symplectic manifold M preserves the symplectic form ω (i.e. in more physical jargon:
generates (a one-parameter family of) canonical transformations) iﬀ X is Hamiltonian
in the sense that there is a scalar function f such that X = Xf ≡ ω♯(df ). Or in terms
of the Poisson bracket, with · representing the argument place for a scalar function:
X(·) = Xf (·) ≡ {·, f }.

11

So much by way of introducing symplectic manifolds. I turn to showing that any
cotangent bundle T ∗Q is such a manifold. That is: it has, independently of a choice of
coordinates or bases, a symplectic structure.

Given a manifold Q (dim(Q)=n) which we think of as the system’s conﬁguration
space, choose any local coordinate system q on Q , and the natural local coordinates
q, p thereby induced on T ∗Q. We deﬁne the 2-form

dp ∧ dq := dpi ∧ dqi := Σn

i=1dpi ∧ dqi .

(2.6)

In fact, eq. 2.6 deﬁnes the same 2-form, whatever choice we make of the chart q on Q.
For dp ∧ dq is the exterior derivative of a 1-form on T ∗Q which is deﬁned naturally (i.e.
independently of coordinates or bases) from the derivative (also known as: tangent)
map of the projection

π : (q, p) ∈ T ∗Q 7→ q ∈ Q.

Thus consider a tangent vector τ (not to Q, but) to the cotangent bundle T ∗Q at a
point η = (q, p) ∈ T ∗Q, i.e. q ∈ Q and p ∈ T ∗
q . Let us write this as: τ ∈ Tη(T ∗Q) ≡
T(q,p)(T ∗Q). The derivative map, Dπ say, of the natural projection π applies to τ :

Dπ : τ ∈ T(q,p)(T ∗Q) 7→ (Dπ(τ )) ∈ Tq .

Now deﬁne a 1-form θH on T ∗Q by

θH : τ ∈ T(q,p)(T ∗Q) 7→ p(Dπ(τ )) ∈ IR ;

where in this deﬁnition of θH, p is deﬁned to be the second component of τ ’s base-point
(q, p) ∈ T ∗Q; i.e. τ ∈ T(q,p)(T ∗Q) and p ∈ T ∗
q .
This 1-form is called the canonical 1-form on T ∗Q. One now checks that in any

natural local coordinates q, p, θH is given by

θH = pidqi.

Finally, we deﬁne a 2-form by taking the exterior derivative of θH :

d(θH ) := d(pidqi) ≡ dpi ∧ dqi .

One checks that this 2-form is closed (since d2 = 0) and non-degenerate. So (T ∗Q, d(θH ))
is a symplectic manifold. Accordingly, d(θH ), or its negative −d(θH ), is called the
canonical symplectic form, or canonical 2-form.

There is a theorem (Darboux’s theorem) to the eﬀect that locally, any symplectic
manifold “looks like” a cotangent bundle: or in other words, a cotangent bundle is
locally a “universal” example of symplectic structure. We will not go into details; but
in Section 5.3.4, we will discuss the generalization of this theorem for Poisson manifolds.
But ﬁrst we review, in the next two Subsections, Hamilton’s equations, and Noether’s
theorem.

2.1.2 Geometric formulations of Hamilton’s equations

As we already emphasised, the main geometric idea behind Hamilton’s equations is that
a gradient, i.e. covector, ﬁeld dH determines a vector ﬁeld XH. So to give a geometric
formulation of Hamilton’s equations at a point x = (q, p) in a cotangent bundle T ∗Q,
let us write ω♯ for the (basis-independent) isomorphism from the cotangent space to
x → Tx, induced by ω := −d(θH ) = dqi ∧ dpi (cf. eq. 2.5). Then
the tangent space, T ∗
Hamilton’s equations may be written as:

˙x = XH(x) = ω♯(dH(x)) = ω♯(dH(x)) .

There are various other formulations. Applying ω♭, the inverse isomorphism Tx → T ∗
x ,
to both sides, we get

In terms of the symplectic form ω at x, this is: for all vectors τ ∈ Tx

ω♭XH(x) = dH(x) .

ω(XH(x), τ ) = dH(x) · τ ;

or in terms of the contraction (also known as: interior product) iXα of a diﬀerential
form α with a vector ﬁeld X, with · marking the argument place of τ ∈ Tx:

iXH ω := ω(XH(x), ·) = dH(x)(·) .

More brieﬂy, and now written for any function f , it is:

iXf ω = df .

Finally, recall the relation between the Poisson bracket and the directional derivative
(or the Lie derivative L) of a function: viz.

LXf g = dg(Xf ) = Xf (g) = {g, f } .

(2.17)

Combining this with eq. 2.16, we can state the relation between the symplectic form
and Poisson bracket in the form:

{g, f } = dg(Xf ) = iXf dg = iXf (iXgω) = ω(Xg, Xf ) .

(2.18)

2.1.3 Noether’s theorem

The core idea of Noether’s theorem, in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frame-
works, is that to every continuous symmetry of the system there corresponds a con-
served quantity (a ﬁrst integral, a constant of the motion). The idea of a continuous
symmetry is made precise along the following lines: a symmetry is a vector ﬁeld on
the state-space that (i) preserves the Lagrangian (respectively, Hamiltonian) and (ii)
“respects” the structure of the state-space.

13

In the Hamiltonian framework, the heart of the proof is a “one-liner” based on the
fact that the Poisson bracket is antisymmetric. Thus for any scalar functions f and H
on a symplectic manifold (M, ω) (and so with a Poisson bracket given by eq. 2.18), we
have that at any point x ∈ M

Xf (H)(x) ≡ {H, f }(x) = 0

iﬀ

0 = {f, H}(x) ≡ XH(f )(x) .

(2.19)

In words: around x, H is constant under the ﬂow of the vector ﬁeld Xf (i.e. under
what the evolution would be if f was the Hamiltonian) iﬀ f is constant under the ﬂow
XH. Thinking of H as the physical Hamiltonian, so that XH represents the real time-
evolution (sometimes called: the dynamical ﬂow), this means: around x, Xf preserves
the Hamiltonian iﬀ f is constant under time-evolution, i.e. f is a conserved quantity
(a constant of the motion).

But we need to be careful about clause (ii) above: the idea that a vector ﬁeld re-
spects” the structure of the state-space. In the Hamiltonian framework, this is made
precise as preserving the symplectic form. Thus we deﬁne a vector ﬁeld X on a symplec-
tic manifold (M, ω) to be symplectic (also known as: canonical) iﬀ the Lie-derivative
along X of the symplectic form vanishes, i.e. LXω = 0. (This deﬁnition is equivalent
to X’s generating (active) canonical transformations, and to its preserving the Poisson
bracket. But I will not go into details about these equivalences: for they belong to the
theory of canonical transformations, which, as mentioned, I will not need to develop.)

We also deﬁne a Hamilton system to be a triple (M, ω, H) where (M, ω) is a sym-
plectic manifold and H : M → IR, i.e. M ∈ F (M). And then we deﬁne a (continuous)
symmetry of a Hamiltonian system to be a vector ﬁeld X on M that:

(i) preserves the Hamiltonian function, LXH = 0; and
(ii) preserves the symplectic form, LXω = 0.

These deﬁnitions mean that to prove Noether’s theorem from eq. 2.19, it will suﬃce
to prove that a vector ﬁeld X is symplectic iﬀ it is locally of the form Xf . Such a vector
ﬁeld is called locally Hamiltonian. (And a vector ﬁeld is called Hamiltonian if there is
a global scalar f : M → IR such that X = Xf .) In fact, two results from the theory of
diﬀerential forms, the Poincar´e Lemma and Cartan’s magic formula, make it easy to
prove this; (for a vector ﬁeld on any symplectic manifold (M, ω), i.e. (M, ω) does not
need to be a cotangent bundle).

Again writing d for the exterior derivative, we recall that a k-form α is called:
(i): exact if there is a (k−1)-form β such that α = dβ; (cf. the elementary deﬁnition

of an exact diﬀerential);
(ii): closed if dα = 0.

The Poincar´e Lemma states that every closed form is locally exact. To be precise: for
any open set U of M, we deﬁne the vector space Ωk(U) of k-form ﬁelds on U. Then
the Poincar´e Lemma states that if α ∈ Ωk(M) is closed, then at every x ∈ M there is
a neighbourhood U such that α |U ∈ Ωk(U) is exact.

Cartan’s magic formula is a useful formula (proved by straightforward calculation)
relating the Lie derivative, contraction and the exterior derivative. It says that if X

14

is a vector ﬁeld and α a k-form on a manifold M, then the Lie derivative of α with
respect to X (i.e. along the ﬂow of X) is

LXα = diXα + iXdα .

(2.20)

We now argue as follows. Since ω is closed, i.e. dω = 0, Cartan’s magic formula,

eq. 2.20, applied to ω becomes

LXω ≡ diXω + iXdω = diXω .

(2.21)

So for X to be symplectic is for iXω to be closed. But by the Poincar´e Lemma, if iXω
closed, it is locally exact. That is: there locally exists a scalar function f : M → IR
such that

iXω = df i.e. X = Xf .

(2.22)

So for X to be symplectic is equivalent to X being locally Hamiltonian.

Thus we have

Noether’s theorem for a Hamilton system If X is a symmetry of
a Hamiltonian system (M, ω, H), then locally X = Xf ; so by the anti-
symmetry of the Poisson bracket, eq. 2.19, f is a constant of the motion.
if f : M → IR is a constant of the motion, then Xf is a
And conversely:
symmetry.

We will see in Section 6.2 that most of this approach to Noether’s theorem, in
particular the “one-liner” appeal to the anti-symmetry of the Poisson bracket, eq. 2.19,
carries over to the more general framework of Poisson manifolds. For the moment, we
mention an example (which we will also return to).

For most Hamiltonian systems in euclidean space IR3, spatial translations and ro-
tations are (continuous) symmetries. Let us consider in particular a system we will
discuss in more detail in Section 2.3: N point-particles interacting by Newtonian grav-
ity. The Hamiltonian is a sum of two terms, which are each individually invariant
under translations and rotations:

(i) a kinetic energy term K; though I will not go into details, it is in fact deﬁned

by the euclidean metric of IR3, and is thereby invariant; and

(ii) a potential energy term V ; it depends only on the particles’ relative distances,

The corresponding conserved quantities are the total linear and angular momen-

and is thereby invariant.

tum.7

7By the way, this Hamiltonian is not invariant under boosts. But as I said in (iii) of Section 1.2, I
restrict myself to time-independent transformations; the treatment of symmetries that “represent the
relativity of motion” needs separate discussion.

15

2.2 The road ahead

In this Subsection, four comments will expand on the introductory comment (iv) of
Section 1.2, and also give some information about the history of symplectic reduction
and about some crucial examples.

(1): Generalizing from Noether’s theorem; Poisson manifolds:—

Noether’s theorem tells us that a continuous symmetry, i.e. a one-parameter group of
symmetries, determines a ﬁrst integral (i.e. a constant of the motion). So a larger group
of symmetries, i.e. a group with several parameters, implies several ﬁrst integrals. The
phase ﬂow is therefore conﬁned to the intersection of the level surfaces of these integrals:
an intersection which is in general a manifold. In other words: the simultaneous level
manifold of these integrals is an invariant manifold of the phase ﬂow.

It turns out that, in many useful cases, this manifold is also invariant under an
appropriately chosen subgroup of the group of symmetries; and that the quotient space,
i.e. the set of orbits under the action of this subgroup, is a manifold with a natural
structure induced by the original Hamiltonian system that is suﬃcient to do mechanics
in Hamiltonian style. The quotient space is therefore called the ‘reduced phase space’.

But in some cases, this natural structure is not a symplectic form, but a (mild)
generalization in which the the form is allowed to be degenerate; i.e.
like eq. 2.3
rather than eq. 2.4. A manifold equipped with such a structure need not be a quotient
manifold. It can instead be deﬁned in terms of a generalization of the usual Poisson
bracket, as deﬁned in terms of the symplectic form by eq. 2.18.

The key idea is to postulate a bracket, acting on the scalar functions F : M → IR on
any manifold M, and possessing four properties enjoyed by the usual Poisson bracket.
One of the properties is anti-symmetry, emphasised in Section 2.1.3’s proof of Noether’s
theorem. The other three are that the postulated bracket, again written {, }, is: to be
bilinear; to obey the Jacobi identity for any real functions F, G, H on M, i.e.

{{F, H}, G} + {{G, F }, H} + {{H, G}, F } = 0 ;

(2.23)

and to obey Leibniz’ rule for products, i.e.

{F, H · G} = {F, H} · G + H · {F, G} .

(2.24)

We will see in Section 5 that such a bracket, again called ‘Poisson bracket’, provides
a suﬃcient framework for mechanics in Hamiltonian style. In particular, it induces an
anti-symmetric bilinear form that may be degenerate, as in eq. 2.3. A manifold M
equipped with such a bracket is called a Poisson manifold.

The allowance of degeneracy means that a Poisson manifold can have odd dimension;
while we saw in Section 2.1.1 that any symplectic manifold is even-dimensional. On the
other hand, this generalized Hamiltonian mechanics will have clear connections with
the usual formulation of Section 2.1. The main connection will be the result that any
Poisson manifold M is a disjoint union of even-dimensional manifolds, on which M’s

16

degenerate antisymmetric bilinear form restricts to be non-degenerate.8

(2): Historical roots:—

The theory of symplectic reduction has deep historical roots in the work of classical me-
chanics’ monumental ﬁgures. In part, this is no surprise. As mentioned in (i) of Section
1.2, cyclic coordinates underpin the role of symmetry in mechanics, and in particular
Noether’s theorem. And Newton’s solution of the Kepler problem provides an exam-
ple: witness textbooks’ expositions of the transition to centre-of-mass coordinates, and
of polar coordinates with the angle being cyclic (yielding angular momentum as the
conserved quantity). So it is unsurprising that various results and ideas of symplectic
reduction can be seen in the work of such masters as Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, Ja-
cobi, Lie and Poincar´e; for example (as we will see), in Euler’s theory of the rigid body.
But the history also holds a surprise. It turns out that Lie’s epoch-making work on
Lie groups already contained a detailed development of much of the general, modern
theory.9 The sad irony is that most of Lie’s insights were not taken up—and were
then repeatedly re-discovered. So this is yet another example (of which the history of
mathematics has so many!) of the saying that he who does not learn from history is
doomed to repeat it. The consolation is of course that it is often easier, and more fun,
to re-discover something than to learn it from another...

Thus it was only from the mid-1960s that the theory, in essentially the form Lie
had, was recovered and cast in the geometric language adopted by modern mechanics;
namely, by contemporary masters such as Arnold, Kostant, Marsden, Meyer, Smale,
Souriau and Weinstein; (cf. this Chapter’s ﬁrst motto). Happily, several of these mod-
ern authors are scholars of the history, and even their textbooks give some historical
details: cf. Marsden and Ratiu (1999, pp. 336-8, 369-370, 430-432), and the notes to
each Chapter of Olver (2000: especially p.427-428). (Hawkins (2000) is a full history
of Lie groups from 1869 to 1926; for Lie, cf. especially its Sections 1.3, 2.5 and Chapter
3, especially 3.2.)

In any case, setting history aside: symplectic reduction has continued since the
1970s to be an active research area in contemporary mechanics, and allied ﬁelds such
as symplectic geometry. So it has now taken its rightful place as a major part of the
contemporary renaissance of classical mechanics: as shown by ...

(3): Two examples: the rigid body and the ideal ﬂuid:—

Two examples illustrate vividly how symplectic reduction can give new physical un-
derstanding, even of time-honoured examples: the rigid body and the ideal ﬂuid—as
attested by this Chapter’s mottoes. (Section 2.3 will develop a third example, more
closely related to philosophy.)

As to the rigid body: we will see (especially in Section 5) that symplectic reduction
considerably clariﬁes the elementary theory of the rigid body (Euler’s equations, Euler
8Because of these clear connections, it is natural to still call the more general framework ‘Hamil-

tonian’; as is usually done. But of course this is just a verbal matter.

9The main source is his (1890). Besides, Arnold (1989: 456) reports that the prototype example
of a Poisson manifold, viz. the dual of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra, was already understood by
Jacobi.

17

angles etc.): which, notoriously, can be all too confusing! For simplicity, I shall take
the rigid body to be pivoted, so as to set aside translational motion. This will mean
that the group of symmetries deﬁning the quotienting procedure will be the rotation
It will also mean that the rigid body’s conﬁguration space is given by the
group.
rotation group, since any conﬁguration can be labelled by the rotation that obtains it
from some reference-conﬁguration. So in this application of symplectic reduction, the
symmetry group (viz. the rotation group) will act on itself as the conﬁguration space.
This example will also give us our prototype example of a Poisson manifold.

As to the ideal ﬂuid, i.e. a ﬂuid that is incompressible and inviscid (with zero
viscosity): this is of course an inﬁnite-dimensional system, and so (as I announced in
Section 1.2) outside the scope of this Chapter. So I will not go into any details, but
just report the main idea.

The equations of motion of an ideal ﬂuid, Euler’s equations, are usually derived
either by applying Newton’s second law F = ma to a small ﬂuid element; or by a
heuristic use of the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian approach (as in heuristic classical ﬁeld
theories). But in the mid-1960s, Arnold showed how the latter derivations could be
understood in terms of a striking, even beautiful, analogy with the above treatment
of the rigid body. Namely, the analogy shows that the conﬁguration space of the
ﬂuid is an inﬁnite-dimensional group; as follows. The conﬁguration of an ideal ﬂuid
conﬁned to some container occupying a volume V ⊂ IR3 is an assignment to each
spatial position x ∈ V of an inﬁnitesimal ﬂuid element. Given such an assignment
as a reference-conﬁguration, any other conﬁguration can be labelled by the volume-
preserving diﬀeomorphism d from V to V that carries the reference-conﬁguration to
the given one, by dragging each ﬂuid element along by d. So given a choice of reference-
conﬁguration, the ﬂuid’s conﬁguration space is given by the inﬁnite-dimensional group
D of diﬀeomorphisms d : V → V :
just as the rotation group is the conﬁguration
space of a (pivoted) rigid body. D then forms the basis for rigorous Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian theories of an ideal ﬂuid.

These theories turn out to have considerable analogies with the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian theories of the rigid body, thanks to the fact that in both cases the sym-
metry group forms the conﬁguration space. In particular, Euler’s equations for ideal
ﬂuids are the analogues of Euler’s equations for a rigid body. Besides, these rigorous
theories of ﬂuids (and symplectic reduction applied to them) are scientiﬁcally impor-
tant: they have yielded various general theorems, and solved previously intractable
problems. (For more details, cf. Abraham and Marsden (1978: Sections 4.4 and 4.6
for the rigid body, and 5.5.8 for the ideal ﬂuid), Arnold (1989: Appendix 2:C to 2:F
for the rigid body, and 2:G to 2:L for the ideal ﬂuid), and Marsden and Ratiu (1999:
Chapters 1.4 and 15 for the rigid body, and 1.5, p. 266, for the ideal ﬂuid).)

(4): Philosophical importance:—

Symplectic reduction is also, I submit, philosophically important; in at least two ways.
The ﬁrst way is speciﬁc: it illustrates some methodological morals about how classical
mechanics analyses problems. I develop this theme in (Butterﬁeld 2005). The second

18

way is more general: the theory, or rather various applications of it, is directly relevant
to disputes in the philosophy of space and time, and of mechanics. This relevance
is recognized in contemporary philosophy of physics. So far as I know, the authors
who develop these connections in most detail are Belot and Earman. They discuss
symplectic reduction in connection with such topics as:

(i) the treatment of symmetries, including gauge symmetries;
(ii) the dispute between absolute and relationist conceptions of space and time; and
(iii) the interpretation of classical general relativity (a topic which connects (i) and

(ii), and bears on heuristics for quantum gravity).
Thus Belot (1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2003a) and Earman (2003) discuss mainly (i) and-
or (ii); Belot and Earman (2001) discusses (iii). For (i) and (ii), I also recommend
Wallace (2003).

But these papers have a demanding pre-requisite: they invoke, but do not expound,
the theory of symplectic reduction. They also discuss inﬁnite-dimensional systems
(especially classical electromagnetism and general relativity), without developing ﬁnite-
dimensional examples like the rigid body. Indeed, there is, so far as I know, no article-
length exposition of the theory which is not unduly forbidding for philosophers. So I
aim to give such an exposition, to help readers of papers such as those cited.10

As an appetizer for this exposition, I will ﬁrst (in Section 2.3) follow Belot in
presenting the general features of a ﬁnite-dimensional symplectic reduction which has
vivid philosophical connections, viz.
relationist debate. This
example concerns a system of point-particles in Euclidean space, either moving freely
or interacting by a force such as Newtonian gravity.
(The symmetries deﬁning the
quotienting procedure are given by the Euclidean group of translations and rotations.)
For philosophers, this will be a good appetizer for symplectic reduction, since it sheds
considerable light on relationism about space of the sort advocated by Leibniz and
Mach.

2.3 Appetizer: Belot on relationist mechanics

2.3.1 Comparing two quotienting procedures

In several papers, Belot discusses how symplectic reduction bears on the absolute-vs.-
relational debate about space. I shall pick out one main theme of his discussions: the
comparison of a relational classical mechanical theory with what one gets by quoti-
enting the orthodox absolutist (also called a ‘substantivalist’) classical mechanics, by

Marsden and Ratiu, and Olver. More precisely, I will mostly draw on: Abraham and Marsden (1978:
Sections 3.1-3.3, 4.1-4.3), Arnold (1989: Appendices 2, 5 and 14), Marsden and Ratiu (1999: Chapters
9-13) and Olver (2000: Chapter 6). And much of what follows—in spirit, and even in letter—is already
in Lie (1890)! As a (non-philosophical) introduction to symplectic reduction, I also recommend Singer
(2001). It is at a yet more elementary level than what follows; e.g.
it omits Poisson manifolds and
co-adjoint representations.

an appropriate symmetry group. His main contention—which I endorse—is that this
comparison sheds considerable light on relationism: on both its motivation, and its
advantages and disadvantages.11

Belot’s overall idea is as follows. Where the relationist admits one possible conﬁg-
uration, as (roughly) a speciﬁcation of all the distances (and thereby angles) between
all the parts of matter, the absolutist (or substantivalist) sees an inﬁnity of possibili-
ties: one for each way the relationist’s conﬁguration (a relative conﬁguration) can be
embedded in the absolute space. This makes it natural to take the relationist to be
envisaging a mechanics which is some sort of “quotient” of the absolutist’s mechanics.
In particular, on the traditional conception of space as Euclidean (modelled by IR3),
each of the relationist’s relative conﬁgurations corresponds to an equivalence class of
absolutist conﬁgurations (i.e. embeddings of arrangements of matter into IR3), with
the members of the class related by spatial translations and rotations, i.e. elements of
the Euclidean group. In the jargon of group actions, to be developed in Section 4: the
Euclidean group acts on the set of all absolutist conﬁgurations, and a relative conﬁgu-
ration corresponds to an orbit of this action. So it is natural to take the relationist to
be envisaging a mechanics which quotients this action of the Euclidean group, to get
a relative conﬁguration space. A relationist mechanics, of Lagrangian or Hamiltonian
type, is then to be built up on this space of relative conﬁgurations.

But as Belot emphasises, one can instead consider quotienting the absolutist’s state-
space—i.e. in a Hamiltonian framework, the phase space—rather than their conﬁgura-
tion space. Indeed, this is exactly what one does in symplectic reduction. In particular,
the Euclidean group’s action on the absolutist’s conﬁguration space, Q say, can be lifted
to give an action on the cotangent bundle T ∗Q; which is accordingly called the ‘cotan-
gent lift’. One can then take the quotient, i.e. consider the orbits into which T ∗Q is
partitioned by the cotangent lift.

We thus have two kinds of theories to compare: (i) the relationist theories, built up
from the relative conﬁguration space; which for the sake of comparison with symplectic
reduction we take to be Hamiltonian, rather than Lagrangian; (ii) theories obtained
by quotienting “later”, i.e. quotienting the absolutist’s cotangent bundle.

I will now spell out this comparison. But I will not try to summarize Belot’s more
detailed conclusions, about what such a comparison reveals about the advantages and
disadvantages of relationism. They are admirably subtle, and so defy summary: they
can mainly be found at his (2000: p. 573-574, 582; 2001: Sections VIII to X). (Rovelli
(this volume) also discusses relationism.)

As beﬁts an appetizer, I will also (like Belot) concentrate on as simple a case as
possible: a mechanics of N point-particles, which is to assume a Euclidean spatial
geometry. Of course, the absolutist make this assumption by postulating a Euclidean
space; but for the relationist, the assumption is encoded in constraints relating the
11The main references are Belot (1999, 2001, 2003: Sections 3.5, 5). Cf. also his (2000: Sections
4 to 5.3), (2003a: Section 6). Though I recommend all these papers, the closest template for what
follows is (2001: Section VI et seq.).

various inter-particle distances. The main current example of a relationist mechanics
of such a system is due to Barbour and Bertotti (1982), though they develop it in the
Lagrangian framework; (to be precise, in terms of Jacobi’s principle). Belot also dis-
cusses other relational theories, including ﬁeld theories, i.e. theories of inﬁnite systems;
some of them also due to Barbour, and in a Lagrangian framework. But in this Section
I only consider N point-particles.

Also, I will also not discuss boosts, though of course the relationist traditionally
proposes to identify any two absolutist states of motion related by a boost. In terms
of group actions, this means I will consider quotienting by an action of the euclidean
group, but not the Galilei group. (Cf. how I set aside time-dependent transformations
already in (iii) of Section 1.2.) I will also postpone to later Sections technical details,
even when our previous discussion makes them accessible.

Finally, a warning to avoid later disappointment! The later Sections will not in-
clude a full analysis of the euclidean group’s actions on conﬁguration space and phase
space, and their quotients. That would involve technicalities going beyond an appe-
tizer. Instead (as mentioned at the end of Section 1.2), the material in later Sections
is chosen so as to lead up to Section 7’s theorem, the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem,
about quotienting the phase space of a system whose conﬁguration space is a Lie group.
Further reasons for presenting the material for this theorem will be given in Section
5.1.

2.3.2 The spaces and group actions introduced

Let us begin by formulating the orthodox absolutist mechanics of N point-particles
interacting by Newtonian gravity, together with the action of the Euclidean group.

Each point-particle occupies a point of IR3, so that the conﬁguration space Q is IR3N :
dim(Q) = 3N. So the phase space for Hamiltonian mechanics will be the cotangent
bundle T ∗Q ∋ (q, p): dim(T ∗Q) = 6N.

The Hamiltonian is a sum of kinetic and potential terms, K and V . K depends
only on the ps, and V only on the qs. In cartesian coordinates, with i now labelling
particles i = 1, ..., N rather than degrees of freedom, we have the familiar expressions:

H(q, p) = K(p) + V (q) with K = Σi

, V (q) = G Σi<j

(2.25)

p2
i
2mi

mimj
k qi − qj k

where mi are the masses and G is the gravitational constant.12,13

12From the broader philosophical perspective, the most signiﬁcant feature of eq. 2.25 is no doubt
the fact that the potential is a sum of all the two-body potential energies for the conﬁguration q ∈ Q:
there are no many-body interactions.

13Incidental remark. In fact, the kinetic energy can be represented by a metric g on the conﬁguration
space. For Hamiltonian mechanics, this means that the kinetic energy scalar K on the cotangent
bundle T ∗Q can be deﬁned by applying Q’s metric g to the projections of the momenta p, where at
each point (q, p) ∈ T ∗Q the projection is made with the preferred isomorphism ω♯ : T ∗
q → Tq; (cf. eq.

21

The euclidean group E (aka: E(3)) is the group (under composition) of transla-
tions, rotations and reﬂections on IR3. But since we will be interested in continuous
symmetries, we will ignore reﬂections, and so consider the subgroup of orientation-
preserving translations and rotations; i.e. the component of the group connected to
the identity transformation (which I will also write as E). This is a Lie group, i.e. a
group which is also a manifold, with the group operations smooth with respect to the
manifold structure. Section 3 will give formal details. Here we just note that we need
three real numbers to specify a translation (x = (x, y, z)), and three to specify a rota-
tion (two for an axis, and one for the angle through which to rotate); and accordingly,
it is unsurprising that as a manifold, the dimension of E is 6: dim(E) = 6.

E acts in the obvious sense on IR3. For example, if g ∈ E is translation by x ∈ IR3,
g induces the map q ∈ IR3 7→ q + x. Similarly for a rotation induces: again, Section 3
will give a formal deﬁnition.

Now let E act in this way on each of the N factor spaces IR3 of our system’s
conﬁguration manifold Q = IR3N . This deﬁnes an action Φ on Q: i.e. for all g ∈ E,
there is a map Φg : Q → Q. For example, for g = a translation by x ∈ IR3, we have

Φg : (qj) = (q1, ..., qN ) ∈ Q 7→ (q1 + x, ..., qN + x) ∈ Q ;

(2.27)

and similarly for rotations. Since the potential function V : Q → IR of eq. 2.25 depends
only on inter-particle distances, each map Φg : Q → Q is a symmetry of the potential;
i.e. we have V (Φg(q)) = V (q).

The action Φ (i.e. the assignment g ∈ E 7→ Φg) induces an action of E on T ∗Q =
T ∗IR3N , called the cotangent lift of Φ to T ∗Q, and usually written as Φ∗; so that we
have for each g ∈ E a lifted map Φ∗
g : T ∗Q → T ∗Q. Again, the details can wait till
later (Section 4). But the idea is that each map Φg on Q is smooth, and so maps curves
to curves, and so vectors to vectors, and so covectors to covectors, and so on.

Unsurprisingly, each of the lifted maps Φ∗

g : T ∗Q → T ∗Q leaves the potential V , now
considered as a scalar on T ∗Q, invariant: i.e. we have V (Φ∗
g(q, p)) = V (q, p) ≡ V (q).
But furthermore, each of the lifted maps Φ∗
g is a symmetry of the Hamilton system, in
our previous sense (Section 2.1.3). That is: Φ∗
g preserves the Hamiltonian (indeed the
kinetic and potential terms are separately invariant); and it preserves the symplectic
structure. This means the dynamics is invariant under the action of all g ∈ G: the
dynamical histories of the system through (q, p) and through Φ∗
g(q, p) match exactly
at each time. They are qualitatively indistinguishable: in contemporary metaphysical
jargon, they are duplicates.

At this point, of course, we meet the absolute-vs.-relational debate about space. The
absolutist asserts, and the relationist denies, that there being two such indistinguishable
possibilities makes sense.14 So the relationist, presented with the theory above, says

2.12). That is:—

K : (q, p) ∈ T ∗Q 7→ gq(ω♯(p), ω♯(p)) .

(2.26)

14The locus classicus for this debate is of course the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, though the

22

we should cut down the space of possibilities. As I said in Section 2.3.1, it is natural
to make this precise in terms of quotienting the action of the euclidean group: a set of
absolutist possibilities related one to another by elements of the euclidean group form
an equivalence class (an orbit) which is to represent one relationist possibility.

But here we need to distinguish two diﬀerent quotienting procedures. I will call
them Relationism and Reductionism (with capital R’s), since the former is close to both
traditional and contemporary relationist proposals, and the latter is an example of the
orthodox idea of symplectic reduction. As I said in Section 2.3.1, the main diﬀerence
will be that:

(i): Relationism performs the quotient on E’s action on the conﬁguration space Q;
the set of orbits form a relative conﬁguration space, on which the relationist proposes
to build a dynamics, whether Lagrangian or Hamiltonian—yielding in the latter case,
a relative phase space; whereas

(ii): Reductionism performs the quotient on E’s action on the usual phase space

T ∗Q, the set of orbits forming a reduced phase space.

Since our discussion adopts the Hamiltonian framework, it will not matter for what
follows, that Relationism, as deﬁned, can adopt the Lagrangian framework, while Re-
ductionism is committed to the Hamiltonian one. What will matter is that (i) and (ii)
make for phase spaces of diﬀerent dimensions; the reduced phase space has six more
dimensions than the relative phase space. The “dimension gap” is six.

We will see that four of the six variables that describe these dimensions are con-
stants of the motion; the other two vary with time. And for certain choices of values
of the constants of the motion (roughly: no rotation), the time-varying variables drop
out, and the dynamics according to the Reductionist theory simpliﬁes so as to coincide
with that of the Relationist theory. In other words: if we impose no rotation, then the
heterodox Relationist dynamics matches the conventional Reduced dynamics.

2.3.3 The Relationist procedure

The Relationist seeks a mechanics based on the relative conﬁguration space (RCS). An
element of the RCS is to be a pattern of inter-particle distances and angles that is
geometrically possible, i.e. compatible with the N particles being embedded in IR3.
So, roughly speaking, an element of the RCS is a euclidean conﬁguration, modulo
isometries; and the RCS will be the set of orbits IR3N /E.

Even before giving a more precise statement, we can state the “punchline” about
dimensions, as follows. Since dim(E) = 6, quotienting by E subtracts six dimensions:

protagonists’ argumentation is of course sometimes theological. Clarke the absolutist maintains that
there are many possible arrangements of bits of matter in space consistent with a speciﬁcation of all
relative distances, saying ‘if [the mere will of God] could in no case act without a pre-determining
cause ... this would tend to take away all power of choosing, and to introduce fatality.’ Leibniz claims
‘those two states ... would not at all diﬀer from one another.
there is only one such arrangement:
Their diﬀerence therefore is only to be found in our chimerical supposition of the reality of space in
itself.’

23

that is, the dimension of the RCS will be 3N-6.

But we need to be more precise about the RCS. For the orbits and quotient spaces
to be manifolds, and for dimensions to add or subtract in this simple way, we need to
excise two classes of “special” points from IR3N , before we quotient. (But I postpone
till Section 4 the technical rationale for these excisions.)

Let δQ ⊂ IR3N be the set of conﬁgurations which are symmetric: i.e. each is ﬁxed
by some element of E (other than the identity element!). Any conﬁguration in which
all the point-particles are collinear provides an example: the conﬁguration is ﬁxed by
any rotation about the line as axis. Let ∆Q be the set of collision conﬁgurations; i.e.
conﬁgurations in which two or more particles are coincident in the usual conﬁguration
space IR3N . (The Q subscripts will later serve as a reminder that these sets are sets
of conﬁgurations.) δQ and ∆Q are both of measure zero in IR3N . Excise both of them,
and call the resulting space, which is again of dimension 3N: Q := IR3N − (δQ ∪ ∆Q).
δQ and ∆Q are each closed under the action of E. That is, each is a union of orbits:
a euclidean transformation of a symmetric (collision) conﬁguration is also symmetric
(collision). So E acts on Q. Now quotient Q by E. Q/E is the Relationist’s RCS.
Since dim(E) = 6, we have: dim(Q/E) = 3N-6.

These 3N −6 variables encode all of a (relative) conﬁguration’s particle-pair relative
distances, rij ∈ IR (with i, j labelling particles). Note that there are N(N − 1)/2 such
relative distances; and for N > 4, this is greater than 3N − 6: (for N >> 4, it is much
greater). So the relative distances, though physically intuitive, give an over-complete
set of coordinates on Q/E. (So they cannot be freely chosen: there are constraints
between them.)

So the Relationist seeks a mechanics that uses this RCS. Newton’s second law
being second-order in time means that she will also need quantities like velocities (in
a Lagrangian framework) or like momenta (in a Hamiltonian framework). For the
former, she will naturally consider the N(N − 1)/2 relative velocities ˙rij := d
dtrij; and
for the latter, the corresponding momenta pij := ∂L
. Again, she must beware of
∂ ˙rij
constraints. The tangent and cotangent bundles built on her RCS Q/E will each have
dimension 2(3N − 6) = 6N − 12. So again, for N > 4, the number N(N − 1)/2 of
relative velocities ˙rij, or of relative momenta pij, is greater than the number of degrees
of freedom concerned; and for N >> 4, it is much greater. So again, the relative
velocities or relative momenta are over-complete: there are constraints.

On the other hand, if the Relationist uses only these relative quantities, rij and
either ˙rij or pij (or “equivalent” coordinates on T (Q/E) or T ∗(Q/E) that are not over-
complete), she faces a traditional problem—whatever the other details of her theory. At
least, she faces a problem if she hopes for a deterministic theory which is empirically
equivalent to the orthodox absolutist theory.
I will follow tradition and state the
problem in terms of relative velocities rather than momenta.

The problem concerns rotation; (and herein lies the strength of Newton’s and
Clarke’s position in the debate against Leibniz). For according to the absolutist theory
two systems of point-particles could match with respect to all relative distances and

24

relative velocities, and yet have diﬀerent future evolutions; so that a theory allowing
the same possibilities as the absolutist one, yet using only these relative quantities (or
“equivalent” variables) would have to be indeterministic.

The simplest example is an analogue for point-particles of Newton’s two globes
thought-experiment. Thus the systems could each consist of just two point-particles
with zero relative velocity. One system could be non-rotating, so that the point-
particles fall towards each other under gravity; while the other system could be rotat-
ing about an axis normal to the line between the particles, and rotating at just such a
rate as to balance the attractive force of gravity.

The Relationist has traditionally replied that they do not hope for a theory empir-
ically equivalent to the absolutist one. Rather, they envisage a mechanics in which, of
the two systems mentioned, only the non-rotating evolution is possible: more gener-
ally, a mechanics in which the universe as a whole must have zero angular momentum.
Originally, in authors like Leibniz and Mach, this reply was a promissory note. But
modern Relationist theories such as Barbour and Bertotti’s (1982) have made good
the promise; and they have been extended well beyond point-particles interacting by
Newtonian gravity. Besides, since the universe seems in fact to be non-rotating, these
theories can even claim to be empirically adequate, at least as regards this principal
diﬀerence from absolutist theories.15

But it is not my brief to go into these theories’ details, except by way of comparison

with a quotiented version of the absolutist theory: cf. Section 2.3.4.

2.3.4 The Reductionist procedure

The Reductionist’s main idea is to quotient only after passing to the orthodox phase
space for N point-particles, i.e. the cotangent bundle T ∗IR3N of IR3N . So the idea is
to consider (T ∗IR3N )/E, i.e. the quotient of T ∗IR3N by the cotangent-lifted action Φ∗
of the euclidean group E.

More precisely, we again proceed by ﬁrst excising special points that would give
technical trouble. But now the points to be excised are in the cotangent bundle T ∗IR3N ,
not in IR3N . So let δ ⊂ T ∗IR3N be the set of phase space states whose conﬁgurations are
symmetric (in the sense of Section 2.3.3’s δQ). Let ∆ ⊂ T ∗IR3N be the set of collision
points; i.e. states in which two or more particles are coincident in the conﬁguration
space IR3N . Both δ and ∆ are of measure zero. Excise both of them, and call the
resulting phase space, which is again of dimension 6N: M := T ∗IR3N − (δ ∪ ∆).

δ and ∆ are each closed under the cotangent-lifted action of E on T ∗IR3N . That is,
each is a union of orbits: the cotangent lift of a euclidean transformation acting on a
phase space state with a symmetric (collision) conﬁguration yields a state which also
15An advocate of the absolutist theory might say that it is odd to make what seems a contingent
feature of the universe, non-rotation, a principle of mechanics; and the Relationist might reply that
their view has the merit of predicting that the universe does not rotate! I fear there are no clear
criteria for settling this methodological dispute; anyway, I will not pursue it.

25

has a symmetric (collision) conﬁguration. So E acts on M. Now quotient M by E,
getting ¯M := M/E. This is called reduced phase space. We have: dim( ¯M ) = dim(M)
- dim(E) = 6N − 6.

As emphasised at the end of Section 2.3.2, ¯M has six more dimensions than the
corresponding Relationist phase space (whether the velocity phase space (tangent bun-
dle) or the momentum phase space (cotangent bundle)). The dimension of those phase
spaces is 2(3N − 6) = 6N − 12. Indeed, we can better understand both the reduced
phase space ¯M and Relationist phase spaces by considering this “dimension gap”.
There are two extended comments to make.

(1): Obtaining the Relationist phase space:—

We can obtain the Relationist momentum phase space from our original phase space
M. Thus let M0 be the subspace of M in which the system has total linear momentum
and total angular momentum both equal to zero. Since these are constants of the
motion, M0 is dynamically closed and so supports a Hamiltonian dynamics given just
by restriction of the original dynamics. With linear and angular momentum each
contributing three real numbers, dim(M0) = dim(M) - 6 = 6N − 6. Furthermore,
M0 is closed under (is a union of orbits under) the cotangent-lifted action of E. So
let us quotient M0 by this action of E, and write ¯M0 := M0/E. Then dim( ¯M0) =
6N − 6 − 6 = 6N − 12.

Now recall that this is the dimension of the phase space of the envisaged Relationist
theory built on the RCS Q/E. And indeed, as one would hope: ¯M0 is the Hamiltonian
version of Barbour and Bertotti’s 1982 Relational theory; (recall that they work in a
Lagrangian framework).

That is: ¯M0 is a symplectic manifold, and points in ¯M0 are parametrized by all the
particle-to-particle relative distances and relative velocities. There is a deterministic
dynamics which matches that of the original absolutist theory, once the original dy-
namics is projected down to Section 2.3.3’s relative conﬁguration space Q/E.

In short: the vanishing total linear and angular momenta mean that an initial
state comprising only relative quantities is suﬃcient to determine all future relative
quantities.

(2): Decomposing the Reductionist reduced phase space:—

Let us return to the reduced phase space ¯M . The ﬁrst point to make is that since
the Hamiltonian H on M, or indeed on T ∗IR3N , is invariant under the cotangent-
lifted action of E, the usual dynamics on M projects down to ¯M = M/E. That is:
the reduced phase space dynamics captures all the E-invariant features of the usual
dynamics.

In fact, ¯M is a Poisson manifold. So it is our ﬁrst example of the more general
framework for Hamiltonian mechanics announced in (1) of Section 2.2. Again, I post-
pone technical detail till later (especially Sections 5.1 and 5.2.4). But the idea is that
a Poisson manifold has a degenerate antisymmetric bilinear map, which implies that
the manifold is a disjoint union of symplectic manifolds. Each symplectic manifold is
called a leaf of the Poisson manifold. The leaves’ symplectic structures “mesh” with

26

one another; and within each leaf there is a conventional Hamiltonian dynamics.

Even without a precise deﬁnition of a Poisson manifold, we can describe how M
is decomposed into symplectic manifolds, each with a Hamiltonian dynamics. Recall
that we have: dim( ¯M ) = dim(M) - dim(E) = 6N − 6. This breaks down as:

6N − 6 = (6N − 12) + 3 + 3 = 2(3N − 6) + 3 + 3 =: α + β + γ

(2.28)

where the right hand side deﬁnes α, β, γ respectively as 2(3N − 6), 3 and 3. In terms
of ¯M , this means the following.

(i): α corresponds to (1)’s ¯M0, i.e. to T ∗(Q/E). As discussed, 3N − 6 variables
encode all the particle-pair relative distances; and the other 3N − 6 variables encode
all the particle-pair relative momenta.

The six extra variables additional to these 6N-12 relative quantities consist of: four
constants of the motion, and two other variables which are dynamical, i.e. change in
time.

(ii): β stands for three of the four constants of the motion: viz. the three variables
that encode the total linear momentum of the system, i.e. the momentum of the centre
of mass. These constants of the motion are “just parameters” in the sense that: (a)
not only does specifying a value for all three of them ﬁx a surface, i.e. a (6N − 9)-
dimensional hypersurface in ¯M , on which there is a Hamiltonian dynamics; also (b)
this Hamiltonian and symplectic structure is independent of the values we specify.16

(iii): γ stands for the three variables that encode the total angular momentum of
the system. One of these is a fourth constant of the motion, viz. the magnitude L
of the total angular momentum. The other two time-varying quantities ﬁx a point on
a sphere (2-sphere) of radius L, encoding the direction of the angular momentum of
the system in a frame rotating with it. The situation is as in the elementary theory
of the rigid body: though the total angular momentum relative to coordinates ﬁxed
in space is a constant of the motion (three constant real numbers), the total angular
momentum relative to the body is constant only in magnitude (one real number L), not
in direction. This will be clearer in Section 5 onwards, when we describe the Poisson
manifold structure in the theory of the rigid body. For the moment, there are two main
comments to make about the N particle system:—

(a): If we specify L, in addition to the momentum of the centre of mass of the
system, we get a (6N − 10)-dimensional hypersurface in ¯M , on which (as in (ii)) there
is a Hamiltonian dynamics. So we can think of ¯M as consisting of the four real-
parameter family of these hypersurfaces, with each point of each hypersurface being
equipped with a sphere of radius L; (subject to a qualiﬁcation in (b) below).

Note that here ‘each point being equipped’ does not mean that the sphere gives
16As mentioned at the end of Section 2.3.1, the relationist traditionally proposes to identify abso-
lutist states of motion that diﬀer just by the value of the total momentum. And indeed, the proposal
can be implemented by considering an action of the Galilean group on the absolutist phase space
M , and identifying points related by Galilean boosts. For discussion and references, cf. Belot (2000:
Section 5.3).

27

the extra dimensions that would constitute ¯M as a ﬁbre bundle; (there would be two
dimensions lacking). Rather: in the point’s representation by 6N − 10 real numbers,
two of the numbers can be taken to represent a point on a sphere.

(b): But unlike the situation for β in (ii) above, the Hamiltonian dynamics on
such a hypersurface depends on the value of L.
In particular, if L = 0 the sphere
representing the body angular momentum is degenerate: it is of radius zero, and the
other two time-varying quantities drop out. A point in the hypersurface is represented
by 6N − 12 real numbers; i.e. the hypersurface is 6N − 12-dimensional.

Now recall from Section 2.3.3 or (1) above that 6N − 12 is the dimension of the
phase space of the envisaged Relationist theory built on the RCS Q/E. And indeed,
just as one would hope: the hypersurface with L = 0 and also with vanishing linear
momentum, with its dynamics, is the symplectic manifold and dynamics that is the
Hamiltonian version of Barbour and Bertotti’s 1982 Relational theory of N point-
particles. In terms of (1)’s notation, this hypersurface is ¯M0.

We can sum up this comparison as follows. On this hypersurface ¯M0, the dynamics
in the reduced phase space coincides with the dynamics one obtains for the relative
variables, if one arbitrarily embeds their initial values in the usual absolutist phase
space T ∗IR3N , subject to the constraint that the total angular and linear momenta
vanish, and then reads oﬀ (just by projection) their evolution from the usual evolution
in T ∗IR3N .

2.3.5 Comparing the Relationist and Reductionist procedures

In comparing the Relationist and Reductionist procedures, I shall just make just two ex-
tended comments, and refer to Belot for further discussion. The gist of both comments
is that Reductionism suﬃces: Relationism is not needed. The ﬁrst is a commonplace
point; the second is due to Belot.

2.3.5.A Reductionism allows for rotation The ﬁrst comment reiterates the Re-
ductionist’s ability, and the Relationist’s inability, to endorse Newton’s globes (or
bucket) thought-experiment. The Reductionist can work in either
(i) the (6N − 6)-dimensional phase space ¯M = M/E; or
(ii) the (6N − 9)-dimensional hypersurface got from (i) by specifying the centre of

mass’ linear momentum; or

zero value of L.

(iii) the (6N − 10)-dimensional hypersurface got from (ii) by also specifying a non-

In all three cases, the Reductionist can describe rotation in a way that the Relation-
ist with their (6N − 12)-dimensional space cannot. For she has to hand the three extra
non-relative variables (L and two others) that describe the rotation of the system as a
whole. (Incidentally: that they describe the system as a whole is suggested by there
being just three of them, whatever the value of N.) In particular, she can distinguish
states of rotation and non-rotation (L = 0), in the sense of endorsing the distinctions

28

advocated by the globes and bucket thought-experiments.

The Reductionist can also satisfy a traditional motivation for relationism, which
concerns general philosophy, rather than the theory of motion. It is especially associ-
ated with Leibniz: namely, our theory (or our metaphysics) should not admit distinct
but utterly indiscernible possibilities. One might well ask why we should endorse this
“principle of the identity of indiscernibles” for possibilities rather than objects. For
Leibniz himself, the answer lies (as Belot’s (2001) brings out) in his principle of suﬃ-
cient reason, and ultimately in theology.

But in any case the Reductionist can satisfy the requirement. Agreed, the usual
absolutist theory, cast in T ∗IR3N (or if you prefer, M = T ∗IR3N − (δ ∪ ∆)) has nine
variables that describe (i) the position of the centre of mass, (ii) the orientation of the
system about its centre of mass, and (iii) the system’s total linear momentum:
i.e.
three variables, a vector in IR3, for each of (i)-(iii). So the usual absolutist theory has
a nine-dimensional “proﬂigacy” of distinct but indiscernible possibilities. But as we
have seen, the Reductionist quotients by the action of the euclidean group E, and so
works in ¯M = M/E: which removes the proﬁgacy about (i) and (ii).

As to (iii), I agree that for all I have said, a job remains to be done. The foliation
of ¯M by a three real-parameter family of (6N − 9)-dimensional hypersurfaces, labelled
by the system’s total linear momentum, codiﬁes the proﬂigacy—but does not eliminate
it. But as I mentioned above (cf. footnote 16), the Reductionist can in fact quotient
further, by considering the action of Galilean boosts and identifying phase space points
that diﬀer by a boost; i.e. deﬁning orbits transverse to these hypersurfaces.

I close my philosophers’ appe-
2.3.5.B Analogous reductions in other theories
tizer for symplectic reduction by summarizing some general remarks of Belot’s (2001:
Sections VIII-IX); cf. also his (2003a, Sections 12, 13). They are about how our dis-
cussion of relational mechanics is typical of many cases; and how symplectic reduction
can be physically important. I label them (1)-(3).

(1): A general contrast: when to quotient:—

The example of N point-particles interacting by Newtonian gravity is typical of a
large class of cases (inﬁnite-dimensional, as well as ﬁnite-dimensional). There is a
conﬁguration space Q, acted on by a continuous group G of symmetries, which lifts to
the cotangent bundle T ∗Q, with the cotangent lift leaving invariant the Hamiltonian,
and so the dynamics. So we can quotient T ∗Q by G to give a reduced theory. (There
is a Lagrangian analogue; but as above, we set it aside.) But there is also some
motivation for quotienting G’s action on Q, irrespective of how we then go on the
construct dynamics. Let us adopt ‘relationism’ as a mnemonic label for whatever
motivates quotienting the conﬁguration space. Then with suitable technical conditions
assumed (recall our excision of δ and ∆), we will have:

(i): for the reduced Hamiltonian theory: dim((T ∗Q)/G) = 2 dimQ - dimG;
(ii): for the relationist theory, in a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian framework:

dim(T (Q/G)) = dim(T ∗(Q/G)) = 2(dimQ - dimG)

29

So we have in the reduced theory, dim G variables that do not occur in the relationist

theory: let us call them ‘non-relational variables’.

(2): The non-relational variables:—

Typically, these non-relational variables represent global, i.e. collective, properties of
the system. That is unsurprising since the number, dim G, of these variables is inde-
pendent of the number of degrees of freedom of the system (dim Q, or 2dim Q if you
count rate of change degrees of freedom separately).

Some of these variables are conserved quantities, which arise (by Noether’s theo-
rem) from the symmetries. Furthermore, there can be speciﬁc values of the conserved
quantities, like the vanishing angular momentum of Section 2.3.4, for which the re-
duced theory collapses into the relationist theory. That is, not only are the relevant
state spaces of equal dimension; but also their dynamics agree.

(3): The reduced theory:—

Typically, the topology and geometry of the reduced phase space (T ∗Q)/G, and the
Hamiltonian function on it, ¯H : (T ∗Q)/G → IR say, are more complex than the
corresponding features of the unreduced theory on T ∗Q.
In particular, the reduced
Hamiltonian ¯H typically has potential energy terms corresponding to forces that are
absent from the unreduced theory. But this should not be taken as necessarily a defect,
for two reasons.

First, there are famous cases in which the reduced theory has a distinctive mo-
tivation. One example is Hertz’ programme in mechanics, viz.
to “explain away”
the apparent forces of our macroscopic experience (e.g. gravity) as arising from re-
duction of a theory that has suitable symmetries. (The programme envisaged cyclic
variables for microscopic degrees of freedom that were unknown to us; cf. Lutzen (1995,
2005).) Another famous example is the Kaluza-Klein treatment of the force exerted on
a charged particle by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. That is: the familiar Lorentz force-law
describing a charged particle’s motion in four spacetime dimensions can be shown to
arise by symplectic reduction from a theory postulating a spacetime with a ﬁfth (tiny
and closed) spatial dimension, in which the particle undergoes straight-line motion.
Remarkably, the relevant conserved quantity, viz. momentum along the ﬁfth dimen-
sion, can be identiﬁed with electric charge; so that the theory can claim to explain the
conservation of electric charge. (This example generalizes to other ﬁelds: for details
and references, cf. Marsden and Ratiu (1999, Section 7.6).)

Second, the reduced theory need not be so complicated as to be impossible to work
with. Indeed, these two examples prove this point, since in them the reduced theory
is entirely tractable: for it is the familiar theory—that one might resist abandoning
for the sake of the postulated unreduced theory.17 Besides, Belot describes how, even
when the reduced theory seems complicated (and not just because it is unfamiliar!),
the general theory of symplectic reduction, as developed over the last forty years, has
17And here one should resist being prejudiced because of familiarity. Why not have Newtonian
gravity arise from a microscopic cyclic degree of freedom? Why not have the Lorentz force law arise
from geodesic motion in a ﬁve-dimensional spacetime with the ﬁfth dimension wrapped up, so that
conservation of charge is explained, in Noether’s theorem fashion, by a symmetry?

30

shown that one can often “do physics” in the reduced phase space: and that, as in the
Kaluza-Klein example, the physics in the reduced phase space can be heuristically, as
well as interpretatively, valuable.

3 Some geometric tools

So much by way of an appetizer. The rest of the Chapter, comprising this Section
and the next four, is the ﬁve-course banquet! This Section expounds some modern
diﬀerential geometry, especially about Lie algebras and Lie groups. Section 4 takes
up actions by Lie groups. Then Section 5 describes Poisson manifolds as a generalized
framework for Hamiltonian mechanics. As I mentioned in (2) of Section 2.2, Lie himself
developed this framework; so in eﬀect, he knew everything in these two Sections—so
it is a true (though painful!) pun to say that these three Sections give us the “Lie of
the land”. In any case, these two Sections will prepare us for Section 6’s description
of symmetry and conservation in terms of momentum maps. Finally, Section 7 will
It concerns the case
present one of the main theorems about symplectic reduction.
where the natural conﬁguration space for a system is itself a Lie group G; (cf. (3) of
Section 2.2). Quotienting the natural phase space (the cotangent bundle on G) will
give a Poisson manifold that “is” the dual of G’s Lie algebra.

In this Section, I ﬁrst sketch some notions of diﬀerential geometry, and ﬁx notation
(Section 3.1). Then I introduce Lie algebras and Lie brackets of vector ﬁelds (Section
3.2). Though most of this Section (indeed this Chapter!) is about diﬀerential rather
than integral notions, I will later need Frobenius’ theorem, which I present in Section
3.3. Then I give some basic information about Lie groups and their Lie algebras
(Section 3.4).

3.1 Vector ﬁelds on manifolds

3.1.1 Manifolds, vectors, curves and derivatives

By way of ﬁxing ideas and notation, I begin by giving details about some ideas in
diﬀerential geometry (some already used in Section 2.1), and introducing some new
notation for them.

A manifold M will be ﬁnite-dimensional, except for obvious and explicit excep-
tions such as the inﬁnite-dimensional group of diﬀeomorphisms of a (as usual: ﬁnite-
dimensional!) manifold. I will not be concerned about the degree of diﬀerentiability in
the deﬁnition of a manifold, or of any associated geometric objects: ‘smooth’ can be
taken throughout what follows to mean C ∞. I will often not be concerned with global,
as against local, structures and results; (though the reduction results we are driving
towards are global in nature). For example, I will not be concerned about whether
curves are inextendible, or ﬂows are complete.

31

I shall in general write a vector at a point x ∈ M as X; or in terms of local
coordinates xi, as X = X i ∂
∂xi (summation convention). From now on, I shall write the
tangent space at a point x ∈ M as TxM (rather than just Tx), thus explicitly indicating
the manifold M to which it is tangent. As before, I write the tangent bundle, consisting
of the “meshing collection” of these tangent spaces, as T M. Similarly, I write a 1-form
(covector) at a point x ∈ M as α; and so the cotangent space at x ∈ M as T ∗
x M; and
as before, the cotangent bundle as T ∗M.

A smooth map f : M → N between manifolds M and N (maybe N = M) maps
smooth curves to smooth curves, and so tangent vectors to tangent vectors; and so
on for 1-forms and higher tensors. It is convenient to write T f , called the derivative
or tangent of f (also written as f∗ or df or Df ), for the induced map on the tangent
bundle.

In more detail:

let us take a curve c in M to be a smooth map from an interval
I ⊂ IR to M, and a tangent vector at x ∈ M, X ∈ TxM, to be an equivalence class
[c]x of curves through x. (The equivalence relation is that the curves be tangent at x,
with respect to every local chart at x; but I omit the details of this.) Then we deﬁne
T f : T M → T N (also written f∗ : T M → T N) by

f∗([c]x) ≡ T f ([c]x) := [f ◦ c]f (x),

for all x ∈ M.

(3.1)

We sometimes write Txf for the restriction of T f to just the tangent space TxM at x;
i.e.

Txf : [c]x ∈ TxM 7→ [f ◦ c]f (x) ∈ Tf (x)N.

(3.2)

In Section 3.1.2.B, we will discuss how one can instead deﬁne tangent vectors to be
diﬀerential operators on the set of all scalar functions deﬁned in some neighbourhood
of the point in question, rather than equivalence classes of curves. One can then deﬁne
the tangent map f∗ ≡ T f in a way provably equivalent to that above.

3.1.2 Vector ﬁelds, integral curves and ﬂows

We will be especially concerned with vector ﬁelds deﬁned on M, i.e. X : x ∈ M 7→
X(x) ∈ TxM, or on a subset U ⊂ M. So suppose that X is vector ﬁeld on M and
f : M → N is a smooth map, so that Txf : TxM → Tf (x)N.

It is important to note (Txf )(X(x)) does
3.1.2.A Push-forwards and pullbacks
not in general deﬁne a vector ﬁeld on N. For f (M) may not be all of N, so that for
y ∈ (N − ran(f )) (Txf )(X(x)) assigns no element of TyN. And f may not be injective,
so that we could have x, x′ ∈ M and f (x) = f (x′) with (Txf )(X(x)) 6= (Tx′f )(X(x′)).
Thus we say that vector ﬁelds do not push forward.

On the other hand, suppose that f : M → N is a diﬀeomorphism onto N: that
is, the smooth map f is a bijection, and its inverse f −1 is also smooth. Then for any
vector ﬁeld X on M, T f (X) is a vector ﬁeld on N. So in this case, the vector ﬁeld does

32

push forward. Accordingly, T f (X) is called the push-forward of X; it is often written
as f∗(X). So for any x ∈ M, the pushed forward vector ﬁeld at the image point f (x)
is given by

(f∗(X))(f (x)) := Txf · X(x) .

(3.3)

(Note the previous use of the asterisk-subscript for the derivative of f , in eq. 3.1.)

This prompts three more general comments.
(1): More generally: we say that two vector ﬁelds, X on M and Y on N, are f -
related on M (respectively: on S ⊂ M) if (T f )(X) = Y at all x ∈ M (respectively:
x ∈ S).

(2): We can generalize the idea that a diﬀeomorphism implies that a vector ﬁeld can
be pushed forward, in two ways. First, the diﬀeomorphism need only be deﬁned locally,
on some neighbourhood of the point x ∈ M of interest. Second, a diﬀeomorphism
establishes a one-one correspondence, not just between vector ﬁelds deﬁned on its
domain and codomain, but also between all diﬀerential geometric objects deﬁned on
its domain and codomain: in particular, 1-form ﬁelds, and higher rank tensors.

(3): (This continues comment (2).) Though vector ﬁelds do not in general push for-
ward, 1-form ﬁelds do in general pull back. This is written with an asterisk-superscript.
That is: for any smooth f : M → N, not necessarily a diﬀeomorphism (even locally),
and any 1-form ﬁeld (diﬀerential 1-form) α on N, we deﬁne the pullback f ∗(α) to be
the 1-form on M whose action, for each x ∈ M, and each X ∈ TxM, is given by:

(f ∗(α))(X) := α |f (x) (T f (X)) .

(3.4)

Similarly, of course if the map f is deﬁned only locally on a subset of M: a 1-form
deﬁned on the range of f pulls back to a 1-form on the domain of f .

3.1.2.B The correspondence between vector ﬁelds and ﬂows The leading
idea about vector ﬁelds is that, for any manifold, the theorems on the local existence,
uniqueness and diﬀerentiability of solutions of systems of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions (e.g. Arnold (1973: 48-49, 77-78, 249-250), Olver (2000: Prop 1.29)) secure a
one-one correspondence between four notions:

(i): Vector ﬁelds X on a subset U ⊂ M, on which they are non-zero; X : x ∈ U 7→

X(x) ∈ TxM, X(x) 6= 0;

(ii): Non-zero directional derivatives at each point x ∈ U, in the direction of the
In terms of coordinates x = x1, ..., xn, these are ﬁrst-order linear dif-
vector X(x).
ferential operators X 1(x) ∂
∂xn , with X i(x) the i-component in this
coordinate system of the vector X(x). Such an operator is often introduced abstractly
as a derivation: a map on the set of smooth real-valued functions deﬁned on a neigh-
bourhood of x, that is linear and obeys the Leibniz rule.

∂x1 + . . . + X n(x) ∂

(iii): Integral curves (aka: solution curves) of the ﬁelds X in U; i.e. smooth maps
φ : I → M from a real open interval I ⊂ IR to U, with 0 ∈ I, φ(0) = x ∈ U, and whose
tangent vector at each φ(τ ), τ ∈ I is X(φ(τ )).

33

(iv): Flows X τ mapping, for each ﬁeld X and each x ∈ U, some appropriate subset
of U to another: X τ : U → M. This ﬂow is guaranteed to exist only in some neigh-
bourhood of a given point x, and for τ in some neighbourhood of 0 ∈ IR; but this will
be enough for us. Such a ﬂow is a one-parameter subgroup of the “inﬁnite-dimensional
group” of all local diﬀeomorphisms.

I spell out this correspondence in a bit more detail:— In local coordinates x1, ..., xn,
any smooth curve φ : I → M is given by n smooth functions φ(τ ) = (φ1(τ ), ..., φn(τ )),
and the tangent vector to φ at φ(τ ) ∈ M is

So for φ to be an integral curve of X requires that for all i = 1, ..., n and all τ ∈ I

˙φ(τ ) = ˙φ1(τ )

∂
∂x1 + . . . + ˙φn(τ )

∂
∂xn .

˙φi(τ ) = X i(τ ).

The local existence and uniqueness, for a given vector ﬁeld X and x ∈ M, of the
integral curve φX,x through x (with φ(0) = x) then ensures that the ﬂow, written
either as X τ or as φX(τ )

X τ : x ∈ M 7→ X τ (x) ≡ φX,x(τ ) ∈ M ,

(3.7)

is (at least locally) well-deﬁned. The ﬂow is a one-parameter group of transformations
of M, and X is called its inﬁnitesimal generator.

The exponential notation

is suggestive. For example, the group operation in the ﬂow, i.e.

exp(τ X)(x) := X τ (x) ≡ φX,x(τ )

X τ +σ(x) = X τ (X σ(x)) ,

is written in the suggestive notation

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.8)

(3.9)

exp((τ + σ)X)(x) = exp(τ X)(exp(σX)(x)) .

(3.10)

So computing the ﬂow for a given X (i.e. solving a system of n ﬁrst-order diﬀerential
equations!) is called exponentiation of the vector ﬁeld X.

Remark:— The above correspondence can be related to our discussion of diﬀeo-
morphisms and pushing forward vector ﬁelds. In particular: if two vector ﬁelds, X on
M and Y on N, are f -related by f : M → N, so that (T f )(X(x)) = Y (f (x)), then f
induces a map from integral curves of X to integral curves of Y . We can express this
in terms of exponentiation of X and Y = (T f )(X):

f (exp(τ X)x) = exp(τ (T f )(X))(f (x)).

(3.11)

Remark:— I emphasise that the above correspondence between (i), (ii), (iii) and

(iv) is not true at a single point. More precisely:

34

(a): On the one hand: the correspondence between (i) and (ii) holds at a point;
and also holds for zero vectors. That is: a single vector X ∈ TxM corresponds to a
directional derivative operator (derivation) at x; and X = 0 corresponds to the zero
derivative operator mapping all local scalars to 0. (Indeed, as I mentioned: vectors are
often deﬁned as such operators/derivations). But:

(b): On the other hand: the correspondence between (i) and (iii), or between (i)
and (iv), requires a neighbourhood. For a single vector X ∈ TxM corresponds to a
whole class of curves (and so: of ﬂows) through x, not to a single curve. Namely, it
corresponds to all the curves (ﬂows) with X as their tangent vector.

However, we shall see (starting in Section 3.4) that for a manifold with suitable
extra structure, a single vector does determine a curve. (And we will again talk of
exponentiation.)

We need to generalize one aspect of the above correspondence (i)-(iv), namely the
(i)-(ii) correspondence between vectors and directional derivatives. This generalization
is the Lie derivative.

3.1.3 The Lie derivative

Some previous Sections have brieﬂy used the Lie derivative. Since we will use it a lot
in the sequel, we now introduce it more thoroughly.

We have seen that given a vector ﬁeld X on a manifold M, a point x ∈ M, and any
scalar function f deﬁned on a neighbourhood of x, there is a naturally deﬁned rate of
change of f along X at x: the directional derivative X(x)(f ).

Now we will deﬁne the Lie derivative along X as an operator LX that deﬁnes a rate
of change along X: not only for locally deﬁned functions (for which the deﬁnition will
agree with our previous notion, i.e. we will have LX(f ) = X(f )); but also for vector
ﬁelds and diﬀerential 1-forms.18 We proceed in three stages.

(1): We ﬁrst deﬁne the Lie derivative as an operator on scalar functions, in terms
of the vector ﬁeld X on M. We deﬁne the Lie derivative along the ﬁeld X (aka: the
derivative in the direction of X), LX, as the operator on scalar functions f : M → IR
deﬁned by:

LX : f 7→ LXf : M → IR with ∀x ∈ M :

|τ =0 f (X τ (x)) ≡ X(x)(f ).
(3.12)
Though this deﬁnition assumes that both X and f are deﬁned globally, i.e. on all of
M, it can of course be restricted to a neighbourhood. Thus deﬁned, LX is linear and
obeys the Leibniz rule, i.e.

(LXf )(x) :=

d
dτ

LX(f g) = f LX(g) + gLX(f ) ;
(3.13)
18Indeed, the deﬁnition can be extended to all higher rank tensors. But I will not develop those
details, since—apart from Section 2.1.3’s mention of the Lie derivative of the symplectic form LX ω
(viz. the requirement that if X is a symmetry, LX ω = 0)—we shall not need them.

35

In coordinates x = x1, ..., xn, LXf is given by

LXf = X 1(x)

∂f
∂x1 + . . . + X n(x)

∂f
∂xn ,

(3.14)

with X i(x) the i-component of the vector X(x). Eq. 3.14 means that despite eq. 3.12’s
mention of the ﬂow X τ , the Lie derivative of a scalar agrees with our previous notion
of directional derivative: that is, for all f , LX(f ) = X(f ).

(2): In (1), the vector ﬁeld X determined the operator LX:

in terms of Section
3.1.2.B’s correspondence, we moved from (i) to (ii). But we can conversely deﬁne a
vector ﬁeld in terms of its Lie derivative; and in Section 3.2.2’s discussion of the Lie
bracket, we shall do exactly this.

In a bit more detail:— We note that the set F (M) of all scalar ﬁelds on M, f :
M → IR forms an (inﬁnite-dimensional) real vector space under pointwise addition.
So also does the set X (M) of all vector ﬁelds on M, X : x ∈ M 7→ X(x) ∈ TxM.
Furthermore, X (M) is isomorphic as a real vector space, and as an module over the
scalar ﬁelds, to the collection of operators LX. The isomorphism is given by the map
θ : X 7→ LX deﬁned in (1).

(3): We now extend the deﬁnition of LX so as to deﬁne it on vector ﬁelds Y
and 1-forms α. We can temporarily use θ as notation for either a vector ﬁeld Y or a
diﬀerential 1-form α. Given a vector ﬁeld X and ﬂow X τ ≡ φX(τ ), we need to compare
θ at the point x ∈ M with θ at the nearby point X τ (x) ≡ φX,x(τ ), in the limit as τ
tends to zero. But the value of θ at X τ (x) is in the tangent space, or cotangent space,
at X τ (x): TXτ (x)M or T ∗
Xτ (x)M. So to make the comparison, we need to somehow
transport back this value to TxM or T ∗

x M.

Fortunately, the vector ﬁeld X provides a natural way to deﬁne such a transport.
For the vector ﬁeld Y , we use the diﬀerential (i.e. push-forward) of the inverse ﬂow,
to “get back” from X τ (x) to x. Using φ∗(τ ) for this “pullback” of φX,x(τ ), we deﬁne

φ∗(τ ) := T (exp(−τ X)) ≡ d exp(−τ X) : TXτ (x)M ≡ Texp(τ X)(x)M → TxM .

(3.15)

For the 1-form α, we deﬁne the transport by the pullback, already deﬁned by eq. 3.4:

φ∗(τ ) := (exp(−τ X))∗ : T ∗

Xτ (x)M ≡ T ∗

exp(τ X)(x)M → T ∗

x M .

(3.16)

With these deﬁnitions of φ∗(τ ), we now deﬁne the Lie derivative LXθ, where θ is
a vector ﬁeld Y or a diﬀerential 1-form α, as the vector ﬁeld or diﬀerential 1-form
respectively, with value at x given by

lim
τ →0

φ∗(τ )(θ |Xτ (x)) − θ |x
τ

d
dτ

=

|τ =0 φ∗(τ )(θ |Xτ (x)) .

(3.17)

Finally, an incidental result to illustrate this Chapter’s “story so far”. It connects
Noether’s theorem, from Section 2.1.3, to this Section’s details about the Lie derivative,
and to the theorem stating the local existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary

36

diﬀerential equations (cf. the start of Section 3.1.2.B). This latter theorem implies that
on any manifold any vector ﬁeld X can be “straightened out”, in the sense that around
any point at which X is non-zero, there is a local coordinate system in which X has
all but one component vanish and the last component equal to 1. Using this theorem,
it is straightforward to show that on any even-dimensional manifold any vector ﬁeld
X is locally Hamiltonian, with respect to some symplectic form, around a point where
X is non-zero. One just deﬁnes the symplectic form by Lie-dragging from a surface
transverse to X’s integral curves.

3.2 Lie algebras and brackets

I now introduce Lie algebras and the Lie bracket of two vector ﬁelds.

3.2.1 Lie algebras

A Lie algebra is a vector space V equipped with a bilinear anti-symmetric operation,
usually denoted by square brackets (and called ‘bracket’ or ‘commutator’), [, ] : V ×V →
V , that satisﬁes the Jacobi identity, i.e.

[[X, Y ], Z] + [[Y, Z], X] + [[Z, X], Y ] = 0 .

(3.18)

3.2.1.A Examples; rotations introduced Here are three examples.

(i): n × n matrices equipped with the usual commutator, i.e. [X, Y ] := XY − Y X.
(So the matrix multiplication “contributes” to the bracket, but not to the underlying
vector space structure.)

(ii): 3 × 3 anti-symmetric matrices, equipped with the usual commutator.
(iii): IR3 equipped with vector multiplication.

In fact, example (iii) is essentially
the same as example (ii); and this example will recur in what follows, in connection
with rotations and the rigid body. (We will also see that example (ii) is in a sense more
fundamental.)

To explain this, we ﬁrst recall that every anti-symmetric operator A on a three-
dimensional oriented euclidean space is the operator of vector multiplication by a ﬁxed
vector, ω say. That is:
for all q, Aq = [ω, q] ≡ ω ∧ q. (Proof: the anti-symmetric
operators on IR3 for a 3-dimensional vector space, since an anti-symmetric 3 × 3 matrix
has three independent components. Vector multiplication by a vector ω is a linear and
anti-symmetric operator; varying ω we get a subspace of the space of all anti-symmetric
operators on IR3; but this subspace has dimension 3; so it coincides with the space of
all anti-symmetric operators.)

With this result in hand, the following three points are all readily veriﬁed.

37

(1): The matrix representation of A in cartesian coordinates is then

(3.19)

0 −ω3
ω3
−ω2

ω2
0 −ω1
ω1

0

A = 





.



1
2

We can write

A ↔ ω or Aij = −ǫijkωk or ωi = −

ǫijkAjk.

(3.20)

(2): The plane Π of vectors perpendicular to ω is an invariant subspace for A, i.e.
A(Π) = Π. And ω is an eigenvector for A with eigenvalue 0. This suggest a familiar
elementary interpretation, which will be conﬁrmed later (Section 3.4): viz. that any
3 × 3 anti-symmetric matrix A represents a inﬁnitesimal rotation, and ω represents
instantaneous angular velocity. That is, we will have, for all q ∈ IR3:
˙q = Aq = [ω, q].
(3): The commutator of any two 3 × 3 anti-symmetric matrices A, B, i.e. [A, B] :=
AB − BA, corresponds by eq. 3.20 to vector multiplication of the axes of rotation.
That is: writing eq. 3.20’s bijection from vectors to matrices as Θ : ω 7→ A =: Θ(ω),
we have for vectors q, r, s

(Θ(q)Θ(r) − Θ(r)Θ(q))s = Θ(q)[r, s] − Θ(r)[q, s]
= [q, [r, s]] − [r, [q, s]]
= [[q, r], s] = Θ([q, r]) · s.

(3.21)
(3.22)
(3.23)

where the [,] represents vector multiplication, i.e. [q, r] ≡ q ∧ r.

Eq. 3.23 means that Θ gives a Lie algebra isomorphism; and so our example (iii)

is essentially the same as example (ii).

Besides, we can already glimpse why example (ii) is in a sense more fundamental.
For this correspondence between anti-symmetric operators (or matrices) and vectors,
eq. 3.20, is speciﬁc to three dimensions. In n dimensions, the number of independent
components of an anti-symmetric matrix is n(n − 1)/2: only for n = 3 is this equal
to n. Yet we will see later (Section 3.4.4) that rotations on euclidean space IRn of
any dimension n are generated, in a precise sense, by the Lie algebra of n × n anti-
symmetric matrices. So only for n = 3 is there a corresponding representation of
rotations by vectors in IRn.

In the next two Subsections, we shall see other examples of Lie algebras: whose
vectors are vector ﬁelds (Section 3.2.2), or tangent vectors at the identity element
of a Lie group (Section 3.4). The ﬁrst example will be an inﬁnite-dimensional Lie
algebra; the second ﬁnite-dimensional (since we will only consider ﬁnite-dimensional
Lie groups). Besides, the above examples (i) and (ii) (equivalently: (i) and (iii)) will
recur: each will be the vector space of tangent vectors at the identity element of a Lie
group.

3.2.2 The Lie bracket of two vector ﬁelds

Given two vector ﬁelds X, Y on a manifold M, the corresponding ﬂows do not in general
commute: X tY s 6= Y sX t. The non-commutativity is measured by the commutator of
the Lie derivatives of X and of Y , i.e. LXLY − LY LX. (Cf. eq. 3.12 and 3.17 for a
deﬁnition of the Lie derivative.) Here, ‘measured’ can be made precise by considering
Taylor expansions; but I shall not go into detail about this.

What matters for us is that this commutator, which is at ﬁrst glance seems to be a
second-order operator, is in fact a ﬁrst-order operator. This is veriﬁed by calculating in
a coordinate system, and seeing that the second derivatives occur twice with opposite
signs:

(LXLY − LY LX)f = Σi X i ∂

ΣjY j ∂f

− Σj Y j ∂

ΣiX i ∂f

∂xi (cid:18)

∂xj (cid:19)

∂xj (cid:18)

= ... = Σi,j (cid:18)

X i ∂Y j

∂xi − Y i ∂X j

∂xi (cid:19)

(3.26)

(3.27)

∂xi (cid:19)
∂f
∂xj .

So LXLY − LY LX corresponds to a vector ﬁeld: (recall (2) of Section 3.1.3, about
deﬁning a vector ﬁeld from its Lie derivative). We call this ﬁeld Z the Lie bracket (also
known as: Poisson bracket, commutator, and Jacobi-Lie bracket!) of the ﬁelds X and
Y , and write it as [X, Y ]. It is also written as LXY and called the Lie derivative of Y
with respect to X. (Beware: some books use an opposite sign convention.)

Thus Z ≡ [X, Y ] ≡ LXY is deﬁned to be the vector ﬁeld such that

LZ ≡ L[X,Y ] = LXLY − LY LX .

(3.28)

It follows that Z ≡ [X, Y ]’s components in a coordinate system are given by eq.
3.27. This formula can be remembered by writing it (with summation convention, i.e.
omitting the Σ) as

X i ∂

∂xi , Y j ∂

∂xJ (cid:21)

(cid:20)

= X i ∂Y j
∂xi

Another way to write eq. 3.27 is as:

[X, Y ]j = (X · ∇)Y j − (Y · ∇)X j

;

(3.30)

(3.31)

or without coordinates, writing D for the derivative map given by the Jacobian matrix,
as

[X, Y ] = DY · X − DX · Y.

Again, the vector ﬁeld Z ≡ [X, Y ] measures the non-commutation of the ﬂows X t and
Y s: in particular, these ﬂows commute iﬀ [X, Y ] = 0.

We will need three results about the Lie bracket. They concern, respectively, the

relation to Lie algebras, to Poisson brackets, and to Frobenius’ theorem.

(1): The Lie bracket is obviously a bilinear and anti-symmetric operation on the
(inﬁnite-dimensional) vector space X (M) of all vector ﬁelds on M:
[, ] : X (M) ×
X (M) → X (M). One readily checks that it satisﬁed the Jacobi identity. (Expand
L[[X,Y ],Z] = L[X,Y ]LZ−LZL[X,Y ] etc.) So: X (M) is an (inﬁnite-dimensional) Lie algebra.

(2): Returning to Hamiltonian mechanics (Section 2.1): there is a simple and
fundamental relation between the Lie bracket and the Poisson bracket, via the notion
of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds (Section 2.1.3).

Namely: the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld of the Poisson bracket of two scalar functions
f, g on the symplectic manifold M is, upto a sign, the Lie bracket of the Hamiltonian
vector ﬁelds, Xf and Xg, of f and g:

X{f,g} = −[Xf , Xg] = [Xg, Xf ].

(3.32)

Proof: apply the rhs to an arbitrary scalar h : M → IR. One easily obtains X{f,g}(h),
by using:

(i) the deﬁnition of a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld;
(ii) the Lie derivative of a function equals its elementary directional derivative eq.

3.12; and

(iii) the Poisson bracket is antisymmetric and obeys the Jacobi identity.

This result means that the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on a symplectic manifold M,
equipped with the Poisson bracket, form an (inﬁnite-dimensional) Lie subalgebra of
the Lie algebra X (M) of all vector ﬁelds on the symplectic manifold M. Later, it will
be important that this result extends from symplectic manifolds to Poisson manifolds;
(details in Section 5.2.2).

(3): For Frobenius’ theorem (Section 3.3), we need to relate the Lie bracket to
Section 3.1.2’s idea of vector ﬁelds being f -related by a map f : M → N between
manifolds M and N. In short: if two pairs of vector ﬁelds are f -related, so is their Lie
bracket. More explicitly: if X, Y are vector ﬁelds on M, and f : M → N is a map such
that (T f )(X), (T f )(Y ) are well-deﬁned vector ﬁelds on N, then T f commutes with
the Lie bracket:

(T f )[X, Y ] = [(T f )X, (T f )Y ] .

(3.33)

3.3 Submanifolds and Frobenius’ theorem

This Subsection diﬀers from the preceding ones in three ways. First, it emphasises
integral, rather than diﬀerential, notions.

Second: Section 3.1.2.B have emphasised that the integral curves of a vector ﬁeld
correspond to integrating a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Since such curves
are one-dimensional submanifolds of the given manifold, our present topic, viz. higher-
dimensional submanifolds, naturally suggests partial diﬀerential equations. For their
integration involves ﬁnding, given an assignment to each point x of a manifold M of a
subspace Sx (with dimension greater than one) of the tangent space TxM, an integral
surface, i.e. a submanifold S of M whose tangent space at each of its points is Sx.19

However, we will not be concerned with partial diﬀerential equations. For us,
submanifolds of dimension higher than one arise when the span Sx of the tangent
vectors at x to a set of vector ﬁelds ﬁt together to form a submanifold. Thus Frobenius’
theorem states, roughly speaking, that a ﬁnite set of vector ﬁelds is integrable in this
sense iﬀ the vector ﬁelds are in involution. That is: iﬀ their pairwise Lie brackets are
expandable in terms of the ﬁelds; i.e. the vector ﬁelds form a Lie subalgebra of the
entire Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds. We will not need to prove this theorem. But we
need to state it and use it—in particular, for the foliation of Poisson manifolds.

Third: a warning is in order. The intuitive idea of a subset S ⊂ M that is a
smooth manifold “in its own right” can be made precise in diﬀerent ways. So there
are subtleties about the deﬁnition of ‘submanifold’, and terminology varies between
expositions—in a way it does not for the material in previous Sections. I will adopt
what seems to be a widespread, if not majority, terminology.20

3.3.1 Submanifolds

The fundamental deﬁnition is:

Given a manifold M (dim(M)=n), a submanifold of M of dimension k is a subset
N ⊂ M such that for every y ∈ N there is an admissible local chart (i.e. a chart in
19Beware: there is no analogue for partial diﬀerential equations of the local existence and uniqueness
theorem for ordinary diﬀerential equations. Even a ﬁeld of two-dimensional planes in three-dimensional
space is in general not integrable, e.g. the ﬁeld of planes given by the equation dz = ydx. So integrable
ﬁelds of planes, or other tangent subspaces on a manifold, are an exception; and accordingly, the
integration theory for partial diﬀerential equations is less uniﬁed, and more complicated, than that
for ordinary diﬀerential equations.

20My treatment is based on Marsden and Ratiu (1999, p. 124-127, 140) for Section 3.3.1, and
Olver (2000, p. 38-40) for Section 3.3.2. As to varying terminology: Olver (2000, p. 9) deﬁnes
‘submanifold’ to be what we will call an immersed submanifold; (which latter, for us, does not have
to be a submanifold, since the immersion need not be an embedding). Bishop and Goldberg (1980, p.
40-41) provide a similar example. For a detailed introduction to the diﬀerent notions of submanifold,
cf. Darling (1994, Chapters 3 and 5). Note that I will also omit some details, in particular about
Frobenius’ theorem providing regular immersions.

41

M’s maximal atlas) (U, φ) with y ∈ U and with the submanifold property, viz.

(SM). φ : U → IRk × IRn−k and φ(U ∩ N) = φ(U) ∩ (IRk × {0}).

(3.34)

The set N becomes a manifold, generated by the atlas of all charts of the form (U ∩N, φ |
(U ∩ N)), where (U, φ) is a chart of M having the submanifold property. (This makes
the topology of N the relative topology.)

We need to take note of two ways in which submanifolds can be speciﬁed in terms

of smooth functions between manifolds.

(1): A submanifold can be speciﬁed as the set on which a smooth function f : M →
P between manifolds takes a certain value. In eﬀect, this will be a generalization of
eq. 3.34’s requirement that n − k coordinate-components of a chart φ take the value
zero. This will involve the idea that the tangent map T f is surjective, in which case f
will be called a submersion. We will need this approach for quotients of actions of Lie
groups.

(2): A submanifold can be speciﬁed parametrically, as the set of values of a local
parametrization: i.e. as the range of a smooth function f with M as codomain. This
will involve the idea that the tangent map T f is injective, in which case f will be called
an immersion. We will need this approach for Frobenius’ theorem.

(1): Submersions:—

If f : M → P is a smooth map between manifolds, a point x ∈ M is called a regular
point if the tangent map Txf is surjective; otherwise x is a critical point of f . If C ⊂ M
is the set of critical points of M, we say f (C) is the set of critical values of f , and
P − f (C) is the set of regular values of f . So if p ∈ P is a regular value of f , then at
every x ∈ M with f (x) = p, Txf is surjective.

The submersion theorem states that if p ∈ P is a regular value of f , then:
(i): f −1(p) is a submanifold of M of dimension dim(M) - dim(P ); and
(ii): the tangent space of this submanifold at any point x ∈ f −1(p) is the kernel of

f ’s tangent map:

Tx(f −1(p)) = kerTxf .

(3.35)

If Txf is surjective for every x ∈ M, f is called a submersion.

(2): Immersions:—

A smooth map between manifolds f : M → P is called an immersion if Txf is injective
at every x ∈ M. The immersion theorem states that Txf is injective iﬀ there is a
neighbourhood U of x in M such that f (U) is a submanifold of P and f |U : U → f (U)
is a diﬀeomorphism.

NB: This does not say that f (M) is a submanifold of P . For f may not be injective
(so that f (M) has self-intersections). And even if f is injective, f can fail to be a
homeomorphism between M and f (M), equipped with the relative topology induced
from P . A standard simple example is an injection of an open interval of IR into an
“almost-closed” ﬁgure-of-eight in IR2.

Nevertheless, when f : M → P is an immersion, and is also injective, we call f (M)

42

an injectively immersed submanifold (or shorter: an immersed submanifold): though
f (M) might not be a submanifold.

We also deﬁne an embedding to be an immersion that is also a homeomorphism (and
so injective) between M and f (M) (where the latter has the relative topology induced
from P ). If f is an embedding, f (M) is a submanifold of N and f is a diﬀeomorphism
f : M → f (M).

In fact, Frobenius’ theorem will provide injectively immersed submanifolds that
(They must also obey

need not be embedded, and so need not be submanifolds.
another condition, called ‘regularity’, that I will not go into.)

3.3.2 The theorem

We saw at the end of Section 3.2.2 that if two pairs of vector ﬁelds are f -related, so
is their Lie bracket: cf. eq. 3.33. This result immediately yields a necessary condition
for two vector ﬁelds to be tangent to an embedded submanifold: namely

If X1, X2 are vector ﬁelds on M that are tangent to an embedded submanifold S
(i.e. at each x ∈ S, Xi(x) ∈ TxS < TxM), then their Lie bracket [X1, X2] is also
tangent to S.

This follows by considering the diﬀeomorphism f : ˜S → S that gives an embedding
of S in M. One then uses the fact that T f commutes with the Lie bracket, eq. 3.33.
That is: the Lie bracket of the f -related vector ﬁelds ˜X1, ˜X2 on ˜S, which is of course
tangent to ˜S, is carried by T f to the Lie bracket [X1, X2] of X1 and X2. So [X1, X2] is
tangent to S.

The idea of Frobenius’ theorem will be that this necessary condition of two vector
ﬁelds being tangent to a submanifold is also suﬃcient. To be more precise, we need
the following deﬁnitions.

A distribution D on a manifold M is a subset of the tangent bundle T M such that
at each x ∈ M, Dx := D ∩ TxM is a vector space. The dimension of Dx is the rank of
D at x. If the rank of D is constant on M, we say the distribution is regular.

A distribution is smooth if for every x ∈ M, and every X0 ∈ Dx, there is a neigh-
bourhood U ⊂ M of x, and a smooth vector ﬁeld X on U such that (i) X(x) = X0,
(ii) for all y ∈ U, X(y) ∈ Dy. Such a vector ﬁeld X is called a local section of D. Ex-
ample: a set of r vector ﬁelds, X1, ..., Xr each deﬁned on M, together deﬁne a smooth
distribution of rank at most r.

A distribution is involutive if for any pair X1, X2 of local sections, the Lie bracket

[X1, X2](y) ∈ Dy in the two sections’ common domain of deﬁnition.

We similarly say that a set of r smooth vector ﬁelds, X1, ..., Xr, on a manifold M
is in involution if everywhere in M they span their Lie brackets. That is: there are
smooth real functions hk

ij : M → R, i, j, k = 1, ..., r such that at each x ∈ M

[Xi, Xj](x) = Σk hk

ij(x)Xk(x).

(3.36)

(Beware: involution is used in a diﬀerent sense in connection with Liouville’s theorem,

43

viz. a set of real functions on phase space is said to be in involution when all their
pairwise Poisson brackets vanish.)

A distribution D on M is integrable if for each x ∈ M there is a local subman-
ifold N(x) of M whose tangent bundle equals the restriction of D to N(x). If D is
integrable, the various N(x) can be extended to get, through each x ∈ M, a unique
maximal connected set whose tangent space at each of its elements y is Dy. Such a set
is called a (maximal) integral manifold.

NB: In general, each integral manifold is injectively immersed in M, but not embed-
ded in it; and so, by the discussion in (2) of Section 3.3.1, an integral manifold might
not be a submanifold of M. But (like most treatments), I shall ignore this point, and
talk of them as submanifolds, integral submanifolds.

If the rank of D is constant on M, all the integral submanifolds have a common
dimension: the rank of D. But in general the rank of D varies across M, and so does
the dimension of the integral submanifolds.

We similarly say that a set of r vector ﬁelds, X1, ..., Xr, is integrable; viz. if through
every x ∈ M there passes a local submanifold N(x) of M whose tangent space at each
of its points is spanned by X1, ..., Xr. (Again: we allow that at some x, X1(x), ..., Xr(x)
may be linearly dependent, so that the dimension of the submanifolds varies.)

We say (both for distributions and sets of vector ﬁelds) that the collection of integral
manifolds is a foliation of M, and its elements are leaves. Again: if the dimension of
the leaves is constant on M, we say the foliation is regular.

With these deﬁnitions in hand, we can now state Frobenius’ theorem: both in its
usual form, which concerns the case of constant rank, i.e. regular distributions and
vector ﬁelds that are everywhere linearly independent; and in a generalized form. The
usual form is:

Frobenius’ theorem (usual form) A smooth regular distribution is in-
tegrable iﬀ it is involutive.
Or in terms of vector ﬁelds: a set of r smooth vector ﬁelds, X1, ..., Xr, on
a manifold M, that are everywhere linearly independent, is integrable iﬀ it
is in involution.

The generalization comes in two stages. The ﬁrst stage concerns varying rank, but
assumes a ﬁnite set of vector ﬁelds. It is straightforward: this very same statement
holds. That is: a set of r smooth vector ﬁelds, X1, ..., Xr, on a manifold M (perhaps
not everywhere linearly independent) is integrable iﬀ it is in involution.

But for the foliation of Poisson manifolds (Section 5.3.3), we need to consider an
inﬁnite set of vector ﬁelds, perhaps with varying rank; and for such a set, this statement
fails. Fortunately, there is a useful generalization; as follows.

Let X be a set of vector ﬁelds on a manifold M, that forms a vector space. So in
the above discussion of r vector ﬁelds, X can be taken as all the linear combinations
Σr
i=1 fi(x)Xi(x), x ∈ M, where the fi are arbitrary smooth functions f : M → IR.

44

Such an X is called ﬁnitely generated.

For any X forming a vector space, we say (as before) that X is in involution if
[X, Y ] ∈ X whenever X, Y ∈ X . Let Xx be the subspace of TxM spanned by the X(x)
for all X ∈ X . As before, we deﬁne: an integral manifold of X is a submanifold N ⊂ M
such that for all y ∈ N, TyN = Xy; and X is called integrable iﬀ through each x ∈ M
there passes an integral manifold.

As before: if X is integrable, it is in involution. But the converse fails. A further

condition is needed, as follows.

We say that X is rank-invariant if for any vector ﬁeld X ∈ X , the dimension of
the subspace Xexp(τ X)(x) along the ﬂow generated by X is a constant, independent of
τ . (But it can depend on the point x.)

Since the integral curve exp(τ X)(x) through x should be contained in any integral
submanifold, rank-invariance is certainly a necessary condition of integrability. (It also
follows from X being ﬁnitely generated.) In fact we have:

Frobenius’ theorem (generalized form) A system X of vector ﬁelds on
M is integrable iﬀ it is rank-invariant and in involution.

The idea of the proof is to directly construct the integral submanifolds. The submani-
fold through x is obtained as

N = {exp(X1) exp(X2).... exp(Xp)(x) : p ≥ 1, Xi ∈ X }.

(3.37)

The rank-invariance secures that for any y ∈ N, Xy has dimension dim(N).

3.4 Lie groups, and their Lie algebras

I introduce Lie groups and their Lie algebras. By the last two Subsections (Sections
3.4.3 and 3.4.4), we will have enough theory to compute eﬃciently the Lie algebra of
a fundamentally important Lie group, the rotation group.

3.4.1 Lie groups and matrix Lie groups

A Lie group is a group G which is also a manifold, and for which the product and
inverse operations G × G → G and G → G are smooth.

Examples:—-
(i): IRn under addition.
(ii): The group of linear isomorphisms of IRn to IRn, denoted GL(n, IR) and called
the general linear group; represented by the real invertible n × n matrices. This is
an open subset of IRn2
, and so a manifold of dimension n2; and the formulas for the
product and inverse of matrices are smooth in the matrix components.

(iii) The group of rotations about the origin of IR3, represented by 3 × 3 orthogonal

45

matrices of determinant 1; denoted SO(3), where S stands for ‘special’ (i.e. determi-
nant 1), and O for ‘orthogonal’.

In fact, all three examples can be regarded as Lie groups of matrices, with matrix
multiplication as the operation. In example (i), consider the isomorphism θ between
IRn under addition and (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrices with diagonal entries all equal to 1,
other rightmost column entries equal to the given vector in IRn, and all other entries
zero. Thus consider, for the case n = 3:

θ : 



7→



x
y
z

1 0 0 x
0 1 0 y
0 0 1 z
0 0 0 1



.

(3.38)








This suggests that we deﬁne a matrix Lie group to be any set of invertible real matrices,
under matrix multiplication, that is closed under multiplication, inversion and taking
of limits. That a matrix Lie group is a Lie group will then follow from GL(n, IR) being
a Lie group, and the theorem below (in Section 3.4.3) that any closed subgroup of a
Lie group is itself a Lie group.





For matrix Lie groups, some of the theory below simpliﬁes. For example, the
deﬁnition of exponentiation of an element of the group’s Lie algebra reduces to ex-
ponentiation of a matrix. But we will develop some of the general theory, since (as
always!) it is enlightening and powerful.

3.4.2 The Lie algebra of a Lie group

The main result in this Subsection is that for any Lie group G, the tangent space TeG
at the identity e ∈ G has a natural Lie algebra structure that is induced by certain
natural vector ﬁelds on G; as follows.

3.4.2.A Left-invariant vector ﬁelds deﬁne the Lie algebra :
Let G be a Lie group. Each g ∈ G deﬁnes a diﬀeomorphism of G onto itself by left
translation, and similarly by right translation:

Lg : h ∈ G 7→ gh ∈ G ; Rg : h ∈ G 7→ hg ∈ G.

(3.39)

Remark: In Section 4 we will describe this in the language of group actions, saying
that in eq. 3.39 G acts on itself by left and right translation.

Now consider the induced maps on the tangent spaces, i.e. the tangent (aka: deriva-
tive) maps; cf. eq.s 3.1, 3.2. They are (Lg)∗ =: Lg∗, (Rg)∗ =: Rg∗ where for each h ∈ G:

Lg∗ : ThG → TghG and Rg∗ : ThG → ThgG.

(3.40)

In particular: the derivative (Rg)∗ at e ∈ G maps TeG to TgG. This implies that
every vector ξ ∈ TeG deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld on G: its value at any g ∈ G is the image

46

(Rg)∗ξ of ξ under (Rg)∗. Such a vector ﬁeld is called a right-invariant vector ﬁeld: it
is uniquely deﬁned by (applying the derivative of right translation to) its value at the
identity e ∈ G.

In more detail, and now deﬁning left-invariant vector ﬁelds:—

A vector ﬁeld X on G is called left-invariant if for every g ∈ G, (Lg)∗X = X. More
explicitly, let us write ThLg for the tangent or derivative of Lg at h, i.e. for Lg∗ : ThG →
TghG. Then left-invariance requires that

(ThLg)X(h) = X(gh) for every g and h ∈ G.

(3.41)

Thus every vector ξ ∈ TeG deﬁnes a left-invariant vector ﬁeld, written Xξ, on G: Xξ’s
value at any g ∈ G is the image (Lg)∗ξ of ξ under (Lg)∗. In other words: Xξ(g) :=
(TeLg)ξ.

Not only is a left-invariant vector ﬁeld uniquely deﬁned by its value at the identity
e ∈ G. Also, the set XL(G) of left-invariant vector ﬁelds on G is isomorphic as a vector
space to the tangent space TeG at the identity e. For the linear maps α, β deﬁned by

α : X ∈ XL(G) 7→ X(e) ∈ TeG ; and β : ξ ∈ TeG 7→ {g 7→ Xξ(g) := (TeLg)ξ} ∈ XL(G)

compose to give the identity maps:

β ◦ α = idXL(G)

; α ◦ β = idTeG.

(3.42)

(3.43)

XL(G) is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of all vector ﬁelds on G, because it is
closed under the Lie bracket. That is: the Lie bracket of left-invariant vector ﬁelds X
and Y is itself left-invariant, since one can check that for every g ∈ G we have (with L
meaning ‘left’ not ‘Lie’ !)

Lg∗[X, Y ] = [Lg∗X, Lg∗Y ] = [X, Y ].

(3.44)

If we now deﬁne a bracket on TeG by

[ξ, η] := [Xξ, Xη](e)
then TeG becomes a Lie algebra. It is called the Lie algebra of G, written g (or, to
avoid ambiguity about which Lie group is in question: g(G)). It follows from eq. 3.44
that

(3.45)

[Xξ, Xη] = X[ξ,η]

;

(3.46)

that is to say, the maps α, β are Lie algebra isomorphisms.

This result, that TeG has a natural Lie algebra structure, is very important. For,
as we shall see in the rest of Section 3.4: the structure of a Lie group is very largely
determined by the structure of this Lie algebra. Accordingly, as we shall see in Sections
4 and 5 et seq.: this Lie algebra underpins most of the constructions made with the Lie
group, e.g. in Lie group actions. Thus Olver writes that this result ‘is the cornerstone of
Lie group theory ... almost the entire range of applications of Lie groups to diﬀerential
equations ultimately rests on this one construction!’ (Olver 2000: 42).

Before turning in the next Subsection to examples, and the topic of subgroups and
subalgebras, I end with four results, (1)-(4), which will be needed later; and a remark.

47

:

3.4.2.B Four results
(1): Lie group structure determines Lie algebra structure in the following sense.
If
G, H are Lie groups, and f : G → H is a smooth homomorphism, then the derivative
of f at the identity Tef : g(G) → g(H) is a Lie algebra homomorphism. In particular,
for all ξ, η ∈ g(G), (Tef )[ξ, η] = [Tef (ξ), Tef (η)]. (Cf. eq. 3.33.)

(2): Exponentiation again; a correspondence between left-invariant vector ﬁelds and

one-dimensional subgroups:
Recall from Section 3.1, especially eq. 3.8, that each vector ﬁeld X on the manifold G
determines an integral curve φX in G passing through the identity e (with φX(0) = e).
We now write the points in (the image of) this curve as gτ (X and e being understood):

exp(τ X)(e) ≡ X τ (e) ≡ φX,e(τ ) =: gτ .

(3.47)

It is straightforward to show that if X is left-invariant, this (image of a) curve is a one-
parameter subgroup of G: i.e. not just as eq. 3.7 et seq., a one-parameter subgroup of
the group of diﬀeomorphisms of the manifold G. In fact:

gτ +σ = gτ gσ g0 = e g−1

τ = g−τ

.

(3.48)

Besides, the group is deﬁned for all τ ∈ IR; and is isomorphic to either IR or the circle
group SO(2). Conversely, any connected one-parameter subgroup of G is generated by
a left-invariant vector ﬁeld in this way.

Accordingly, we deﬁne exponentiation of elements ξ of g by reference to the isomor-
phisms eq. 3.42 and 3.43. It is also convenient to deﬁne this as a map taking values
in G. Thus for ξ ∈ g and its corresponding left-invariant vector ﬁeld Xξ that takes
as value at g ∈ G, Xξ(g) := (TeLg)(ξ), we write the integral curve of Xξ that passes
through e (with value e for argument τ = 0) as

φξ : τ ∈ IR 7→ exp(τ Xξ)(e) ∈ G .

Then we deﬁne the exponential map of g into G to be the map

exp : ξ ∈ g 7→ φξ(1) ∈ G .

(3.49)

(3.50)

Using the linearity of β as deﬁned by eq. 3.42, these two equations, eq. 3.49 and 3.50,
are related very simply:

exp(τ ξ) := φτ ξ(1) := exp(1.Xτ ξ)(e) = exp(τ Xξ) .

(3.51)

We write expG rather than exp when the context could suggest a Lie group other than
G.

The map exp is a local diﬀeomorphism of a neighbourhood of 0 ∈ g to a neighbour-
hood of e ∈ G; but not in general a global diﬀeomorphism onto G. In modern terms,
this result follows by applying the inverse function theorem to the discussion above.
(It also represents an interesting example of the history of subject; cf. Hawkins (2000:
82-83) for Lie’s version of this result, without explicit mention of its local nature.)

48

The map exp also has the basic property, adding to result (1) above, that ...

(3): Homomorphisms respect exponentiation:

If f : G → H is a smooth homomorphism of Lie groups, then for all ξ ∈ g,

f (expG ξ) = expH ((Tef )(ξ)).

(3.52)

(4): Right-invariant vector ﬁelds as an alternative approach:

We have followed the usual practice of deﬁning g in terms of left-invariant vector ﬁelds.
One can instead use right-invariant vector ﬁelds. This produces some changes in signs,
and in whether certain deﬁned operations respect or reverse the order of two elements
used in their deﬁnition. I will not go into many details about this. But some will be
needed when we consider:

(i): Lie group actions, and especially their inﬁnitesimal generators (Section 4.4 and

4.5);

(ii): reduction on the cotangent bundle of a Lie group—as occurs in the theory of

the rigid body (Section 6.5 and 7.3.3).
For the moment we just note two basic results, (A) and (B); postponing others to
Section 4.4 et seq..

(A): Corresponding to the vector space isomorphism between g and the left-invariant

vector ﬁelds, as in eq. 3.42. viz.

ξ ∈ TeG 7→ Xξ ∈ XL(G) with Xξ(g) := (TeLg)ξ ,

(3.53)

there is a vector space isomorphism to the set of right-invariant vector ﬁelds

ξ ∈ TeG 7→ Yξ ∈ XR(G) with Yξ(g) := (TeRg)ξ .

(3.54)

Besides, the Lie bracket of right-invariant vector ﬁelds is itself right-invariant. So
corresponding to our previous deﬁnition, eq. 3.45, of a Lie bracket on TeG, and its
[Xξ, Xη] = X[ξ,η], that makes TeG ∼= XL(G) a Lie algebra
corollary eq. 3.46, i.e.
isomorphism: we can also deﬁne a Lie bracket on TeG by

[ξ, η]R := [Yξ, Yη](e) ,

(3.55)

and get a Lie algebra isomorphism TeG ∼= XR(G).

(B): But the two Lie brackets, eq. 3.45 and 3.55, on TeG are diﬀerent. In fact one

can show that:

(i): Xξ and Yξ are related by

I∗Xξ = −Yξ

where I : G → G is the inversion map I(g) := g−1, and I∗ is the push-forward on
vector ﬁelds induced by I, cf. eq. 3.3, i.e.

(3.56)

(3.57)

(I∗Xξ)(g) := (T I ◦ Xξ ◦ I −1)(g) .

49

Besides, since I is a diﬀeomorphism, eq. 3.56 makes I∗ a vector space isomorphism.

(ii): It follows from eq. 3.56 that

[Xξ, Xη](e) = −[Yξ, Yη](e) ; so [ξ, η] = −[ξ, η]R .

(3.58)

Finally, a remark about physics. In applications to physics, G is usually the group of
symmetries of a physical system, and so a vector ﬁeld on G is the inﬁnitesimal generator
of a one-parameter group of symmetries. For mechanics, we saw this repeatedly in
Section 2, especially as regards the group of translations and rotations about the origin,
in physical space IR3. This Subsection’s isomorphism between the Lie algebra g and
left-invariant vector ﬁelds on G means that we can think of g also as consisting of
inﬁnitesimal symmetries of the system. (The ξ ∈ g are also called generators of the
group G.)

3.4.3 Examples, subgroups and subalgebras

I begin with the ﬁrst two of Section 3.4.1’s three examples. That will prompt a little
more theory, which will enable us to deal eﬃciently in the next Subsection with the
third example, viz. the rotation group.

(1): Examples:—
(i): G := IRn under addition. G is abelian so that left and right translation coincide.
The invariant vector ﬁelds are just the constant vector ﬁelds, so that XL(G) ≡ XR(G) ∼=
IRn. So the tangent space at the identity TeG, i.e. the Lie algebra g, is itself IRn. The
bracket structure is wholly degenerate: for all invariant vector ﬁelds X, Y , [X, Y ] = 0;
and for all ξ, η ∈ g, [ξ, η] = 0.

(ii): G := GL(n, IR), the general linear group. Since G is open in End(IRn, IRn),
the vector space of all linear maps on IRn (‘End’ for ‘endomorphism’), G’s Lie algebra,
as a vector space, is End(IRn, IRn); (cf. example (i)). To compute what the Lie bracket
is, we ﬁrst note that any ξ ∈ End(IRn, IRn) deﬁnes a corresponding vector ﬁeld on
GL(n, IR) by

Xξ : A ∈ GL(n, IR) 7→ Aξ ∈ End(IRn, IRn) .

Besides, Xξ is left-invariant, since for every B ∈ GL(n, IR), the left translation

LB : A ∈ GL(n, IR) 7→ BA ∈ GL(n, IR)

is linear, and so

Xξ(LBA) = BAξ = TALBXξ(A) .

Applying now eq. 3.31 at the identity I ∈ GL(n, IR) to the deﬁnition of the bracket in
the Lie algebra, eq. 3.45, we have:

[ξ, η] := [Xξ, Xη](I) = DXη(I) · Xξ(I) − DXξ(I) · Xη(I).

(3.62)

But XηA = Aη is linear in A, so DXη(I) · B = Bη. This means that

DXη(I) · Xξ(I) = ξη ;

(3.63)

(3.59)

(3.60)

(3.61)

50

and similarly

DXξ(I) · Xη(I) = ηξ.
(3.64)
So the Lie algebra End(IRn, IRn) has the usual matrix commutator as its bracket:
[ξ, η] = ξη − ηξ. This Lie algebra is often written gl(n, IR).

Let us apply to this example, result (2) from Section 3.4.2.B. In short, the result
said that left-invariant vector ﬁelds correspond (by exponentiation through e ∈ G)
to connected one-parameter subgroups of G. To ﬁnd the one-parameter subgroup
exp(τ Xξ)(e) of GL(n, IR), we take the matrix entries xij, (i, j = 1, ..., n) as the n2
coordinates on GL(n, IR), so that the tangent space at the identity matrix I is the set
of vectors

Σij ξij

∂
∂xij

|I

with ξ = (ξij) an arbitrary matrix. For given ξ, exp(τ Xξ)e is found by integrating the
n2 ordinary diﬀerential equations

dxij
dτ

= Σkξikxkj

; xij(0) = δij.

The solution is just the matrix exponential:

X(τ ) = exp(τ ξ).

(3.65)

(3.66)

(3.67)

More generally, let us return to Section 3.4.1’s idea of a matrix Lie group. For a

matrix Lie group G, the deﬁnition of its Lie algebra can be given as:

g = { the set of matrices ξ = φ′(0) : φ a diﬀerentiable map : IR → G, φ(0) = eG}.

(3.68)
The deduction of the structure of the Lie algebra then proceeds straightforwardly. In
particular, we get the result that the one-parameter subgroup generated by ξ ∈ g is
given by matrix exponentials, as in eq. 3.67: the group is {exp(τ ξ) : τ ∈ IR}.

This result will help us compute our third example: ﬁnding the Lie algebra of the
rotation group. But for that example, it is worth ﬁrst developing a little the result (2)
from Section 3.4.2.B: i.e. the correspondence between left-invariant vector ﬁelds and
connected one-parameter subgroups of G.

(2): More theory:—
First, a warning remark. We will later need to take notice of the fact that a sub-
group, even a one-parameter subgroup, of a Lie group G need not be a submanifold of
G. Here we recall Section 3.3.1’s deﬁnitions of immersion and embedding. Accordingly,
we now deﬁne a subgroup H of a Lie group G to be a Lie subgroup of G if the inclusion
map i : H → G is an injective immersion.

Just as we saw in Section 3.3.1 that not every injective immersion is an embedding,
so also there are examples of Lie subgroups that are not submanifolds. Example: the
torus T2 can be made into a Lie group in a natural way (exercise: do this!); the one-
parameter subgroups on the torus T2 that wind densely on the torus are Lie subgroups

51

that are not submanifolds. (For more details about this example, cf. Arnold (1973:
160-167) or Arnold (1989: 72-74) or Butterﬁeld (2004a: Section 2.1.3.B).)

But it turns out that being closed is a suﬃcient, and necessary, further condition.

That is:

If H is a closed subgroup of a Lie group G, then H is a submanifold of G
and in particular a Lie subgroup. And conversely, if H is a Lie subgroup
that is also a submanifold, then H is closed.

Result (2) from Section 3.4.2.B, i.e. the correspondence between one-dimensional
subgroups of G and one-dimensional subspaces (and so subalgebras) of g, generalizes
to higher-dimensional subgroups and subalgebras. That is to say:

If H ⊂ G is a Lie subgroup of G, then its Lie algebra h := g(H) is a
subalgebra of g ≡ g(G). In fact

h = {ξ ∈ g : exp(τ Xξ)(e) ∈ H , for all τ ∈ IR}.

(3.69)

And conversely, if h is any m-dimensional subalgebra of g, then there is a
unique connected m-dimensional Lie subgroup H of G with Lie algebra h.

The proof of the ﬁrst two statements uses result (1) of Section 3.4.2.B. For the third,
i.e. converse, statement, the main idea is that h deﬁnes m vector ﬁelds on G that
are linearly independent and in involution, so that one can apply Frobenius’ theorem
to infer an integral submanifold. One then has to prove that H is a Lie subgroup:
Olver (2000: Theorem 1.51) and Marsden and Ratiu (1999: 279-280) give details
and references. (Historical note: to see that this result, sometimes called Lie’s ‘third
fundamental theorem’, is close to what Lie himself called the main theorem of his
theory of groups, cf. Hawkins (2000: 83).)

This general correspondence between Lie subgroups and Lie subalgebras prompts
the question whether every ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra g is the Lie algebra of a Lie
group. The answer is Yes. Besides, the question reduces to the case of a matrix Lie
group (i.e. a Lie subgroup of GL(n, IR)), in the sense that: every ﬁnite-dimensional
Lie algebra g is isomorphic to a subalgebra of gl(n, IR), for some n. But be warned:
this does not imply (and it is not true) that every Lie group is realizable as a matrix
Lie group, i.e. that every Lie group is isomorphic to a Lie subgroup of GL(n, IR).

This general correspondence also simpliﬁes greatly the computation of the Lie alge-
bras of Lie groups, for example H := SO(3), that are Lie subgroups of GL(n, IR). We
only need to combine it with example (ii) above, that gl(n, IR) is End(IRn, IRn) with
the usual matrix commutator as its bracket: [ξ, η] = ξη − ηξ.

Thus we infer that the Lie algebra of SO(3), written so(3), is a subalgebra of
End(IRn, IRn) with the matrix commutator as bracket. Besides, we can identify so(3)
by looking at all the one-dimensional subgroups of G contained in it. Combining eq.
3.67 and 3.69, we have

so(3) = {ξ ∈ gl(n, IR) : the matrix exponential exp(τ ξ) ∈ SO(3), ∀τ ∈ IR}.

(3.70)

52

With this result in hand, we can now compute so(3).

3.4.4 The Lie algebra of the rotation group

Our ﬁrst aim is to calculate the Lie algebra so(3) (also written: so(3)) of H := SO(3),
the rotation group. This will lead us back to Section 3.2.1.A’s correspondence between
anti-symmetric matrices and vectors in IR3.

SO(3) is represented by 3 × 3 orthogonal matrices of determinant 1. So the require-

ment in eq. 3.70 becomes, now writing e, not exp:

Diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst equation with respect to τ and setting τ = 0 yields

(eτ ξ)(eτ ξ)T = I and det(eτ ξ) = 1.

ξ + ξT = 0.

(3.71)

(3.72)

So ξ must be anti-symmetric, i.e. represented by an anti-symmetric matrix. Conversely,
for any such anti-symmetric matrix ξ, we can show that det(eτ ξ) = 1. So, indeed:

so(3) = {3 × 3 antisymmetric matrices}.

(3.73)

Notice that the argument is independent of choosing n = 3. It similarly computes

so(n) for any integer n:

so(n) = {n × n antisymmetric matrices}.

(3.74)

Thus the rotations on euclidean space IRn of any dimension n are generated by the Lie
algebra of n × n anti-symmetric matrices.

This justiﬁes our assertion at the end of Section 3.2.1.A that the rotation group in
three dimensions is special in being representable by vectors in the space on which it
acts, i.e. IR3. For as we have just seen, in general the inﬁnitesimal generators of rota-
tions are anti-symmetric matrices, which in n dimensions have n(n − 1)/2 independent
components. But only for n = 3 does this equal n.

Remark: An informal computation of so(3), based on the idea that higher-order
terms in eτ ξ can be neglected (cf. the physical idea that ξ represents an inﬁnitesimal
rotation), goes as follows.

For (I + τ ξ) to be a rotation requires that

(I + τ ξ)(I + τ ξ)T = I and det(I + ξτ ) = 1.

(3.75)

Dropping higher-order terms, the ﬁrst equation yields

I + τ (ξ + ξT ) = I

i.e. ξ + ξT = 0.

(3.76)

53

Besides, the second equation in eq. 3.75 yields no further constraint, since for any
anti-symmetric matrix ξ written as (cf. eq. 3.19)

0 −ξ3

ξ2
0 −ξ1

ξ = 

1 + ξ2

(3.77)

2 + ξ2
we immediately compute that det(I + ξτ ) = 1 + τ 2(ξ2
order terms, det(I + ξτ ) = 1. In short, we again conclude that

3). So, dropping higher-

so(3) = {3 × 3 antisymmetric matrices}.

(3.78)

For later use (e.g. Sections 4.4 and 4.5.1), we note that the three matrices

Having computed so(3) to consist of antisymmetric matrices, we can use Section
3.2.1.A’s correspondence between these and vectors in IR3 so as to realize so(3) as
vectors with the Lie bracket as vector multiplication. With these realizations in hand,
we can readily obtain several further results about rotations. We will not need any.
But a good example, which uses eq. 3.20’s isomorphism Θ from vectors ω ∈ IR3 to
matrices A ∈ so(3), is as follows:—

exp(τ Θ(ω)) is a rotation about the axis ω by the angle τ k ω k.

We can now begin to see the point of this Chapter’s second motto (from Arnold),
that the elementary theory of the rigid body confuses six conceptually diﬀerent three-
dimensional spaces. For our discussion has already distinguished three of the six spaces
which Arnold lists (in a diﬀerent notation). Namely, we have just distinguished:

(i) IR3, especially when taken as physical space; from (ii) so(3) ≡ Te(SO(3)), the
generators of rotations; though they are isomorphic as Lie algebras, by eq. 3.20’s bi-
jection Θ from vectors ω ∈ IR3 to matrices A ∈ so(3);

(ii) so(3) ≡ Te(SO(3)) from its isomorphic copy under the derivative of left trans-
lation by g (i.e. under (Lg)∗), viz. Tg(SO(3)): cf. eq. 3.41. (In the motto, Arnold
writes g for so(3) and G for SO(3).)

In Section 5.2.4 we will grasp (even without developing the theory of the rigid
the rest of the motto. That is, we will see why Arnold also mentions the

body!)

54

three corresponding dual spaces, IR3∗, so(3)∗ and T ∗
g (SO(3)). But we can already say
more about the two tangent spaces so(3) ≡ Te(SO(3)) and Tg(SO(3)), in connection
with the idea that for a pivoted rigid body, the conﬁguration space can be taken as
SO(3); (cf. (3) of Section 2.2). We will show that there are two isomorphisms from
Tg(SO(3)) to Te(SO(3)) that are natural, not only in the mathematical sense of being
basis-independent but also in the sense of having a physical interpretation. Namely,
they represent the computation of the angular velocity from the Lagrangian generalized
˙q. In eﬀect, one isomorphism computes the angular velocity’s components
velocity, i.e.
with respect to an orthonormal frame ﬁxed in space (called spatial coordinates); and the
other computes it with respect to a frame ﬁxed in the rigid body (body coordinates). In
fact, these isomorphisms are the derivatives of right and left translation, respectively;
(cf. eq. 3.39 and 3.40).

So suppose a pivoted rigid body has a right-handed orthonormal frame {a, b, c} ﬁxed
in it. We can think of the three unit vectors a, b, c as column vectors in IR3. Arranging
them in a 3 × 3 matrix g := (a b c) ∈ GL(3, IR), we get a matrix that maps the unit x-
vector e1 to a, the unit y-vector e2 to b, etc. That is: g maps the standard frame e1, e2, e3
to a, b, c, and g is an orthogonal matrix: g ∈ S0(3) = {g ∈ GL(3, IR) | ˜gg = I }. Thus
g represents the conﬁguration of the body, and the conﬁguration space is SO(3).

By diﬀerentiating the condition ˜gg = I, we deduce that the tangent space at a
speciﬁc g Tg(SO(3)), i.e. the space of velocities ˙g, is the 3-dimensional vector subspace
of GL(3, IR):

Tg(SO(3)) = { ˙g ∈ GL(3, IR) |

˙˜gg + ˜g ˙g = 0 }

(3.81)

Now recall examples (ii) and (iii) of Section 3.2.1.A. We saw there that though the
angular velocity of the body is usually taken to be the vector ω such that, with our
“body-vectors” a, b, c,

˙a = ω ∧ a,

˙b = ω ∧ b,

˙c = ω ∧ c :

we can instead encode the angular velocity by the antisymmetric matrix A := Θ(ω) ∈
g ≡ Te(SO(3)). As we saw, eq. 3.82 then becomes

˙a = Θ(ω)a,

˙b = Θ(ω)b,

˙c = Θ(ω)c :

or equivalently the matrix equation for the conﬁguration g = (a b c),

˙g ≡ ( ˙a ˙b ˙c) = Θ(ω)g ;

i.e. Θ(ω) = ˙gg−1 .

Thus we see that the map from Tg(SO(3)) to g = Te(SO(3))

˙g ∈ Tg(SO(3)) 7→ ˙gg−1 ≡ ˙g˜g ∈ g

(3.82)

(3.83)

(3.84)

(3.85)

maps the generalized velocity ˙g to the angular velocity Θ(ω). This is the angular
velocity represented in the usual elementary way, with respect to coordinates ﬁxed in
space. One immediately checks that it is an isomorphism (exercise!).

On the other hand, let us consider Θ(ω) as a linear transformation Θ(ω) : IR3 → IR3,

55

and express it in the body coordinates a, b, c. This gives g−1Θ(ω)g ≡ g−1 ˙g. Thus the
map

˙g ∈ Tg(SO(3)) 7→ g−1 ˙g ≡ ˜g ˙g ∈ g
maps the generalized velocity ˙g to the angular velocity expressed in body coordinates.
It also is clearly an isomorphism.

(3.86)

Summing up: we have two natural isomorphisms that compute the angular velocity,

in spatial and body coordinates respectively, from the generalized velocity ˙g.

Incidentally, one can verify directly that the images ˙g˜g and ˜g ˙g of the isomorphisms
eq. 3.85 and 3.86 lie in g, i.e. are antisymmetric matrices. Thus with · for the
elementary dot-product, we have:

g−1 ˙g ≡ ˜g ˙g = 

( ˙a ˙b ˙c) = 









˜a
˜b
˜c

a · ˙b a · ˙c
0
b · ˙c
b · ˙a
0
c · ˙a c · ˙b
0



.



(3.87)

This is an antisymmetric matrix, since diﬀerentiating a · b = b · c = a · c = 0 with
respect to time gives a · ˙b + ˙a · b = 0 etc. Finally, we deduce that ˙g˜g is antisymmetric
from the facts that ˙g˜g = g(g−1 ˙g)g−1 and antisymmetry is preserved by conjugation by
g.

We end this Subsection with two incidental remarks; (they will not be used in what

follows).

(1): In Section 2.1.1, we could have specialized the discussion from a symplectic
manifold to a symplectic vector space, i.e. a (real, ﬁnite-dimensional) vector space
equipped with a non-degenerate anti-symmetric bilinear form ω : Z × Z → IR.
It
follows that Z is of even dimension. The question then arises which linear maps
A : Z → Z preserve the normal form of ω given by eq. 2.4. It is straightforward to
show that this is equivalent to A preserving the form of Hamilton’s equations (for any
Hamiltonian); so that these maps A are called symplectic (or canonical, or Poisson).
The set of all such maps form a Lie group, the symplectic group, written Sp(Z, ω).
But since this Chapter will not need the theory of canonical transformations, I leave
the study of Sp(Z, ω)’s structure as an exercise! (For details, cf. e.g. Abraham and
Marsden (1978: 167-174), Marsden and Ratiu (1999: 69-72, 293-299).)

(2): Finally, a glimpse of the inﬁnite-dimensional manifolds that this Chapter has
foresworn. Consider the inﬁnite-dimensional Lie group Dif f (M) of all diﬀeomorphisms
on M. An element of its Lie algebra, i.e. a vector A ∈ Te(Dif f (M)), is a vector ﬁeld,
or equivalently a ﬂow, on M. Besides, the Lie bracket in this Lie algebra Te(Dif f (M)),
as deﬁned by eq. 3.45 turns out to be the usual Lie bracket of the vector ﬁelds on M,
as deﬁned in Section 3.2.2.

4 Actions of Lie groups

We turn to actions of Lie groups on manifolds. The notions, results and examples
in this Section will be crucial from Section 5.4 onwards. Fortunately, the foregoing

56

provides several examples of the notions and results we need. Section 4.1 will give basic
material, including the crucial notion of cotangent lifts. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 describe
conditions for orbits and quotient spaces to be manifolds. Section 4.4 describes actions
inﬁnitesimally, i.e. in terms of their inﬁnitesimal generators. Section 4.5 presents two
important representations of a Lie group, its adjoint and co-adjoint representations,
on its Lie algebra g and on the dual g∗ respectively. Finally, Section 4.6 gathers some
threads concerning our central, recurring example, viz. the rotation group.

4.1 Basic deﬁnitions and examples

A left action of a Lie group G on a manifold M is a smooth map Φ : G × M → M
such that:

(i): Φ(e, x) = x for all x ∈ M
(ii): Φ(g, Φ(h, x)) = Φ(gh, x) for all g, h ∈ G and all x ∈ M.
We sometimes write g · x for Φ(g, x).

Similarly, a right action of a Lie group G on a manifold M is a smooth map
Ψ : M × G → M satisfying (i) Ψ(x, e) = x and (ii) Ψ(Ψ(x, g), h) = Ψ(x, gh). We
sometimes write x · g for Ψ(x, g).

It is convenient to also have a subscript notation. For every g ∈ G, we deﬁne

Φg : M → M : x 7→ Φ(g, x).

(4.1)

In this notation, (i) becomes Φe = idM and (ii) becomes Φgh = Φg ◦ Φh. For right
actions, (ii) becomes Ψgh = Ψh ◦ Ψg.

One immediately veriﬁes that any left action Φ of G on a manifold M, g 7→ Φg :

M → M, deﬁnes a right action Ψ by

g 7→ Ψg := Φg−1 : M → M ;

i.e. Ψ : (x, g) ∈ M × G 7→ Φ(g−1, x) ∈ M .

(4.2)

(Use the fact that in G, (gh)−1 = h−1g−1.) Similarly, a right action deﬁnes a left action,
by taking the inverse in G. We will occasionally make use of this left-right “ﬂip”.

The deﬁnition of left action is equivalent to saying that the map g 7→ Φg is a
homomorphism of G into Diﬀ(M), the group of diﬀeomorphisms of M. In the special
case where M is a Banach space V and each Φg : V → V is a continuous linear
transformation, the action of G on V is called a representation of G on V .

The orbit of x ∈ M (under the action Φ) is the set

Orb(x) = {Φg(x) : g ∈ G} ⊂ M.

(4.3)

The action is called transitive if there is just one orbit, i.e. for all x, y ∈ M, there is a
g ∈ G such that g · x = y. It is called eﬀective (or faithful) if Φg = idM implies g = e,
i.e. if g 7→ Φg is one-to-one. It is called free if it has no ﬁxed points for any g 6= e: that
is, Φg(x) = x implies g = e. In other words, it is free if for each x ∈ M, g 7→ Φg(x) is
one-to-one. (So: every free action is faithful.)

4.1.A Examples; cotangent lifts We begin with geometric examples; and then
return to mechanics, giving ﬁrst some general theory, followed by some examples.

(1): Geometric examples:—
(i): SO(3) acts on IR3 by (A, x) 7→ Ax. The action is faithful. But it is neither free
(each rotation ﬁxes the points on its axis) nor transitive (the orbits are the spheres
centred at the origin).

(ii): GL(n, IR) acts on IRn by (A, x) 7→ Ax. The action is faithful, not free, and

“almost transitive”: the zero subspace {0} is an orbit, and so is IRn − {0}.

(iii): Suppose X is a vector ﬁeld on M which is complete in the sense that the ﬂow
φX(τ ) of eq. 3.7 is deﬁned for all τ ∈ IR. Then this ﬂow deﬁnes an action of IR on M.
We turn to two examples which will be central, and recurring, in our discussion of

symplectic reduction.

(iv): Left translation by each g ∈ G, Lg : h ∈ G 7→ gh ∈ G (cf. eq. 3.39), deﬁnes a
left action of G on itself. Since G is a group, it is transitive and free (and so faithful).
Similarly, right translation, g 7→ Rg with Rg : h ∈ G 7→ hg ∈ G, deﬁnes a right action.
And g 7→ Rg−1 deﬁnes a left action; cf. eq. 4.2.

One readily proves that left translation lifts to the tangent bundle T G as a left

action. That is: one veriﬁes by the chain rule that

Φg : T G → T G :

v ≡ vh ∈ ThG 7→ (ThLg)(v) ∈ TghG

(4.4)

deﬁnes a left action on T G. Similarly, right translation lifts to a right action on
T G. But our interest in Hamiltonian mechanics of course makes us more interested
in cotangent lifts. See (2) below for the general deﬁnitions, and example (viii) in (3)
below for the cotangent lift of left translation.

(v): G acts on itself by conjugation (inner automorphism): g 7→ Kg := Rg−1 ◦ Lg.
That is: Kg : h ∈ G 7→ ghg−1 ∈ G. Each Kg is an isomorphism of G. The orbits
are conjugacy classes. Section 4.5 will introduce two “diﬀerentiated versions” of action
by conjugation, viz. the adjoint and co-adjoint actions, which will be important in
symplectic reduction.

(2): Hamiltonian symmetries and cotangent lifts:—

We turn to Hamiltonian mechanics. Following the discussion in Section 2.1.3, we say:
given a Hamilton system (M, ω, H) with (M, ω) a symplectic manifold and H : M →
IR, a Hamiltonian group of symmetries is a Lie group G acting on M such that each
Φg : M → M preserves both ω and H. Then the simplest possible examples are spatial
translations and-or rotations acting on the free particle. The details of these examples,
(vi) and (vii) below, will be clearer if we ﬁrst develop some general theory.

This theory will illustrate the interaction between the left-right contrast for actions,
and the tangent-cotangent contrast for bundles. Besides, both the general theory and
the examples’ details will carry over straightforwardly, i.e. component by component,
to the case of N particles interacting by Newtonian gravity, discussed in Section 2.3.2:
the action deﬁned on a single particle is just repeated for each of the N particles.

So we will take M := (IR3) × (IR3)∗, ω := dqi ∧ dpi, H := p2/2m. In the ﬁrst place,

58

both translations (by x ∈ IR3) and rotations (by A ∈ SO(3)) act on the conﬁguration
space Q = IR3. We have actions of IR3 and SO(3) on IR3 by

Φx(q) = q + x ; ΦA(q) = Aq .

(4.5)

But these actions lift to the cotangent bundle T ∗Q = (IR3) × (IR3)∗ ∼= IR6; (as
mentioned in Section 2.3.2). The lift of these actions is deﬁned using a result that does
not use the notion of an action. Namely:

Any diﬀeomorphism f : Q1 → Q2 induces a cotangent lift T ∗f : T ∗Q2 →
T ∗Q1 (i.e.
in the opposite direction) which is symplectic, i.e. maps the
canonical one-form, and so symplectic form, on T ∗Q2 to that of T ∗Q1.

To deﬁne the lift of an action, it is worth going into detail about the deﬁnition of T ∗f .
(But I will not prove the result just stated; for details, cf. Marsden and Ratiu (1999:
Section 6.3).)

The idea is that T ∗f is to be the “pointwise adjoint” of the tangent map T f :
T Q1 → T Q2 (eq. 3.1). That is: we deﬁne T ∗f in terms of the contraction of its value,
for an arbitrary argument α ∈ T ∗
q2Q2, with an arbitrary tangent vector v ∈ Tf −1(q2)Q1.
(Here it will be harmless to (follow many presentations and) conﬂate a point in T ∗Q2,
i.e. strictly speaking a pair (q2, α), q2 ∈ Q2, α ∈ T ∗
q2Q2, with its form α. And similarly
it will be harmless to conﬂate a point (q1, v) in T Q1 with its vector v ∈ Tq1Q1.)

We recall that any ﬁnite-dimensional vector space is naturally, i.e. basis-independently,

isomorphic to its double dual: (V ∗)∗ ∼= V ; and we will use angle brackets < ; > for
the natural pairing between V and V ∗. So we deﬁne T ∗f ; T ∗Q2 → T ∗Q1 by requiring:

< (T ∗f )(α); v > := < α; (T f )(v) > , ∀ α ∈ T ∗

q2Q2, v ∈ Tf −1(q2)Q1 .

(4.6)

NB: Because T ∗f “goes in the opposite direction”, the composition of lift with function-
composition involves a reversal of the order. That is: if Q1 = Q2 ≡ Q and f, g are two
diﬀeomorphisms of Q, then

T ∗(f ◦ g) = T ∗g ◦ T ∗f.

(4.7)

With this deﬁnition of T ∗f , a left action Φ of G on the manifold Q induces for each

g ∈ G the cotangent lift of Φg : Q → Q. That is: we have the map

T ∗Φg ≡ T ∗(Φg) : T ∗Q → T ∗Q, with α ∈ T ∗

q Q 7→ (T ∗Φg)(α) ∈ T ∗

g−1 · qQ .

(4.8)

Now consider the map assigning to each g ∈ G, T ∗Φg:

g ∈ G 7→ T ∗Φg : T ∗Q → T ∗Q .

(4.9)

To check that this is indeed an action of G on T ∗Q, we ﬁrst check that since Φe = idQ,
T Φe : T Q → T Q is idT Q and T ∗(Φe) is idT ∗Q. But beware: eq. 4.7 yields

T ∗Φgh = T ∗(Φg ◦ Φh) = T ∗Φh ◦ T ∗Φg ,

(4.10)

59

so that eq. 4.9 deﬁnes a right action.

But here we recall that any left action deﬁnes a right action by using the inverse;
cf. eq. 4.2. Combining this with the idea of the cotangent lift of an action on Q, we
get:

The left action Φ on Q deﬁnes, not only the right action eq. 4.9 on T ∗Q, but also

a left action on T ∗Q, viz. by

g ∈ G 7→ Ψg := T ∗(Φg−1) : T ∗Q → T ∗Q .

(4.11)

For since (gh)−1 = h−1g−1,

Ψgh ≡ T ∗(Φ(gh)−1) = T ∗(Φh−1g−1) = T ∗(Φh−1 ◦ Φg−1) = T ∗Φg−1 ◦ T ∗Φh−1 ≡ Ψg ◦ Ψh .
(4.12)
In short, the two reversals of order cancel out. This sort of left-right ﬂip will recur in
some important contexts in the following, in particular in Sections 6.5 and 7.

(3): Mechanical examples:—

So much by way of generalities. Now we apply them to translations and rotations of a
free particle, to rotations of a pivoted rigid body, and to N point-particles.

(vi): Let the translation group G = (IR3, +) act on the free particle’s conﬁguration

space Q = IR3 by

Φx(q) = q + x .

(4.13)

Since G is abelian, the distinction between left and right actions of G collapses. (And
if we identify G with Q, this is left=right translation by IR3 on itself, i.e. example (iv)
again: and so transitive and free.) But of course the lifted actions we have deﬁned,
“with g” and “with g−1”, eq. 4.9 and 4.11 respectively, remain distinct actions.

Then, writing α = (q, p) ∈ T ∗
we see that eq. 4.6 implies that: ﬁrst,

q Q, and using the fact that T Φx(q − x, ˙q) = (q, ˙q),

T ∗(Φx)(q, p) ∈ T ∗

q−xQ ;

(4.14)

and second, that for all ˙q ∈ Tq−xQ,

< T ∗(Φx)(q, p); (q − x, ˙q) > = < (q, p); (q, ˙q) > ≡ p( ˙q) .

(4.15)

For eq. 4.15 to hold for all ˙q ∈ Tq−xQ requires that T ∗(Φx)(q, p) does not aﬀect p, i.e.

T ∗(Φx)(q, p) = (q − x, p) .

(4.16)

So this is the lifted action “with g”, corresponding to eq. 4.9. Similarly, the lifted action
“with g−1”, corresponding to eq. 4.11, is: Ψx(q, p) := T ∗(Φ−x)(q, p) = (q + x, p).

One readily checks that these lifted actions preserve both ω = dqi ∧ dpi (an exercise
in manipulating the exterior derivative) and H := p2/2m. So we have a Hamiltonian
symmetry group. The action is not transitive: the orbits are labelled by their values
of p ∈ (IR3)∗. But it is free.

60

(4.18)

(4.19)

(4.20)

(vii): Let SO(3) act on the left on Q = IR3 by

ΦA(q) = Aq .

(4.17)

(This is example (i) again.) Let us lift this action “with g”, i.e. eq. 4.9, so as to get a
right action on T ∗Q.

As in example (vi), we write α = (q, p) ∈ T ∗

q Q. Using the fact that T ΦA(q, ˙q) =

(Aq, A ˙q), eq. 4.6 then implies that: ﬁrst,

and second, that for all ˙q ∈ TA−1qQ,

T ∗(ΦA)(q, p) ∈ T ∗

A−1qQ ;

< T ∗(ΦA)(q, p); (A−1q, ˙q) > = < (q, p); (q, A ˙q) > ≡ p(A ˙q) ≡ piAi

j ˙qj .

For eq. 4.19 to hold for all ˙q ∈ TA−1qQ requires that

T ∗(ΦA)(q, p) = (A−1q, pA) ,

where pA is a row-vector. Or if one thinks of the p components as a column vector, it
requires:

T ∗(ΦA)(q, p) = (A−1q, ˜Ap) = (A−1q, A−1p) ,
where ˜ represents the transpose of a matrix, and the last equation holds because A is
an orthogonal matrix.

(4.21)

So this is the lifted action “with g”, corresponding to eq. 4.9. Similarly, the
lifted action “with g−1”, corresponding to eq. 4.11, is: ΨA(q, p) := T ∗(ΦA−1)(q, p) =
(Aq, Ap).

Again, one readily checks that these lifted actions preserve both ω = dqi ∧ dpi
(another exercise in manipulating the exterior derivative!) and H := p2/2m. So SO(3)
is a Hamiltonian symmetry group.

Like the original action of SO(3) on Q, these actions are faithful. But they are not
transitive: the orbits are labelled by the radii of two spheres centred at the origins of
IR3 and (IR3)∗. And they are not free: suppose q and p are parallel and on the axis of
rotation of A.

(viii): Now we consider the pivoted rigid body. But unlike examples (vi) and (vii),
we will consider only kinematics, not dynamics: even for a free body. That is, we will
say nothing about the deﬁnitions of, and invariance of, ω and H; for details of these,
cf. e.g. Abraham and Marsden (1978: Sections 4.4 and 4.6) and the other references
given in (3) of Section 2.2. We will in any case consider the dynamics of this example
in more general terms (using momentum maps) in Sections 6.5.3 and 7.

We recall from the discussion at the end of Section 3.4.4 that the conﬁguration
space of the pivoted rigid body is SO(3) =: G. We also saw there that the space and
body representations of the angular velocity v = ˙g ∈ TgG are given by right and left
translation. Thus eq. 3.85 and 3.86 give:

vS ≡ ˙gS := TgRg−1( ˙g) and vB ≡ ˙gB := TgLg−1( ˙g) .

(4.22)

61

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

But we are now concerned with the cotangent lift of left (or right) translation. So let
SO(3) act on itself by left translation: Φgh ≡ Lgh = gh. Let us lift this action “with g”,
h G and (T Lg)(h, ˙h) = (gh, g ˙h).
i.e. eq. 4.9, to get a right action on T ∗G. So let α ∈ T ∗
Then eq. 4.6 implies that: ﬁrst

(T ∗Lg)(α) ∈ T ∗

g−1hG ,

and second that for all v ∈ Tg−1hG

< T ∗(Lg)(α); v > = < α; gv > .

In other words, on analogy with eq. 4.16 and 4.20: for eq. 4.24 to hold for all v ∈ Tg−1hG
requires that with gv ∈ ThG:

T ∗(Lg)(α) : v ∈ Tg−1hG 7→ α(gv) .

Similarly, the lifted action “with g−1” corresponding to eq. 4.11, i.e. the left action on
T ∗G, is

< T ∗(Lg−1)(α); v > = < α; g−1v > , ∀α ∈ T ∗

h G, v ∈ TghG

(4.26)

We will continue this example in Section 4.6, after developing more of the theory of
Lie group actions.

Finally, let us sketch another mechanical example: the case of N particles with
conﬁguration space Q := IR3N interacting by Newtonian gravity—discussed in Section
2.3.2. This will combine and generalize examples (vi) and (vii); and lead on to the
next Sections’ discussions of orbits and quotients.

(ix): As I mentioned above (before eq. 4.5), the cotangent-lifted actions of trans-
lations and rotations on a single particle carry over straightforwardly to the case of
N particles: the action deﬁned on a single particle is just repeated, component by
component, for each of the N particles to give an action on T ∗Q ∼= IR3N × (IR3N )∗.

Furthermore, the groups of translations and rotations are subgroups of a single
group, the Euclidean group E. I shall not deﬁne E exactly. Here, let it suﬃce to say
that:

(a): E’s component-wise action on the conﬁguration space Q := IR3N has a cotan-

gent lift, which is of course also component by component.

(b): E’s cotangent-lifted action is not transitive, nor free; but it is faithful.
(c): If we take as the Hamiltonian function the H of eq. 2.25, describing the parti-
cles as interacting by Newtonian gravity, then E is a Hamiltonian symmetry group. In
fact, the kinetic and potential energies are separately invariant, essentially because the
particles’ interaction depends only on the inter-particle distances, not on their positions
or orientations; cf. the discussion in Section 2.3.2.

A ﬁnal comment about example (ix), which points towards the following Sections:—
Recall that in Sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4, we used this example as a springboard to
discussing Relationist and Reductionist procedures, which quotiented the conﬁguration
space or phase space. But in order for the quotient spaces (and orbits) to be manifolds,

62

and in particular for dimensions to add or subtract in a simple way, we needed to excise
two classes of “special” points, before quotienting. These were: the class of symmetric
those ﬁxed by some element of E), and the class of
conﬁgurations or states (i.e.
collision conﬁgurations or states. For the quotienting of phase space advocated by
Reductionism, the classes of states were δ ⊂ T ∗IR3N and ∆ ⊂ T ∗IR3N ; (cf. Section
2.3.4 for deﬁnitions.)

With examples (vi) to (ix) in hand, we can now see that:

(a): δ and ∆ are each closed under the cotangent-lifted action of E on T ∗IR3N ;

i.e., each is a union of orbits. So E acts on M := T ∗IR3N − (δ ∪ ∆).

(b): E acts freely on M.

We will see in the sequel (especially in Sections 4.3.B and 5.5) that an action being free
is one half (one conjunct) of an important suﬃcient condition for orbits and quotient
spaces to be manifolds. The other conjunct will be the notion of an action being proper:
which we will deﬁne in Section 4.3.

4.2 Quotient structures from group actions

In ﬁnite dimensions, any orbit Orb(x) is an immersed submanifold of M. This can
be proved directly (Abraham and Marsden (1978: Ex. 1.6F(b), p. 51, and 4.1.22 p.
265)). But for our purposes, this is best seen as a corollary of some conditions under
which quotient structures are manifolds; as follows.

The relation, x ∼= y if there is a g ∈ G such that g · x = y, is an equivalence relation,
with the orbits as equivalence classes. We denote the quotient space, i.e. the set of
orbits, by M/G (sometimes called the orbit space). We write the canonical projection
as

π : M → M/G, x 7→ Orb(x) ;

(4.27)

and we give M/G the quotient topology by deﬁning U ⊂ M/G to be open iﬀ π−1(U)
is open in M.

Simple examples (e.g. (ii) of Section 4.1.A) show that this quotient topology need

not be Hausdorﬀ. However, it is easy to show that if the set

R := {(x, Φgx) ∈ M × M : (g, x) ∈ G × M}

(4.28)

is a closed subset of M × M, then the quotient topology on M/G is Hausdorﬀ.

But to ensure that M/G has a manifold structure, further conditions are required.

The main one (and a much harder theorem) is:

R is a closed submanifold of M × M iﬀ M/G is a manifold with π : M →
M/G a submersion.

This theorem has two Corollaries which are important for us.
(1): A map h : M/G → N, from the manifold M/G, for which π : M → M/G is a

submersion, to the manifold N, is smooth iﬀ h ◦ π : M → N is smooth.

63

This corollary has a useful implication, called passage to the quotients, about the

notion of equivariance—which will be important in symplectic reduction.

A smooth map f : M → N is called equivariant if it respects the action of a Lie
group G on the manifolds. That is: Let G act on M and N by Φg : M → M and
Ψg : N → N respectively. f : M → N is called equivariant with respect to these
actions if for all g ∈ G

That is, f is equivariant iﬀ for all g, the following diagram commutes:

(4.29)

(4.30)

f ◦ Φg = Ψg ◦ f.

M

x




f−→

f−→

Ψg

Equivariance immediately implies that f naturally induces a map, ˆf say, on the quo-
tients. That is: the map

ˆf : Orb(x) ∈ M/G 7→ Orb(f (x)) ∈ N/G

(4.31)

is well-deﬁned, i.e. independent of the chosen representative x for the orbit.

Applying the corollary we have: If f : M → N is equivariant, and the quotients
M/G and M/N are manifolds with the canonical projections both submersions, then
f being smooth implies that ˆf is smooth. This is called passage to the quotients.

(2): Let H be a closed subgroup of the Lie group G. (By (2) of Section 3.4.3, this
is equivalent to H being a subgroup that is a submanifold of G.) Let H act on G by
left translation: (h, g) ∈ H × G 7→ hg ∈ G, so that the orbits are the right cosets Hg.
Then G/H is a manifold and π : G → G/H is a submersion.

4.3 Proper actions

By adding to the Section 4.2’s main theorem (i.e., R is a closed submanifold of M × M
iﬀ M/G is a manifold with π : M → M/G a submersion), the notion of a proper action
we can give useful suﬃcient conditions for:
(A): orbits to be submanifolds;
(B): M/G to be a manifold.

An action Φ : G × M → M is called proper if the map

˜Φ : (g, x) ∈ G × M 7→ (x, Φ(g, x)) ∈ M × M

(4.32)

is proper. By this we mean that if {xn} is a convergent sequence in M, and {Φgn(xn)}
is a convergent sequence in M, then {gn} has a convergent subsequence in G.
In
if
ﬁnite dimensions, this means that compact sets have compact inverse images; i.e.
K ⊂ M × M is compact, then ˜Φ−1(K) is compact.

If G is compact, this condition is automatically satisﬁed. Also, the action of a

64

group on itself by left (or by right) translation (Example (iv) of Section 4.1.A) is
always proper. Furthermore, the cotangent lift of left (or right) translation ((2) and
Example (viii) of Section 4.1.A) is always proper. We shall not prove this, but it will
be important in the sequel.

4.3.A Isotropy groups; orbits as manifolds For x ∈ M the isotropy (or stabilizer
or symmetry) group of Φ at x is

Gx := {g ∈ G : Φg(x) ≡ Φ(g, x) = x} ⊂ G.

(4.33)

(So an action is free iﬀ for all x ∈ M, Gx = {e}.)

So if we deﬁne

Φx : G → M : Φx(g) := Φ(g, x)

(4.34)

we have: Gx = (Φx)−1(x). (The notation Φx is a “cousin” of the notation Φg deﬁned
in eq. 4.1.)

So since Φx is continuous, Gx is a closed subgroup of G. So, by the result in (2)
of Section 3.4.3 (i.e. the result before eq. 3.69), Gx is a submanifold (as well as Lie
subgroup) of G. And if the action is proper, Gx is compact.

Furthermore, the fact that for all h ∈ Gx we have Φx(gh) = Φg ◦ Φh(x) = Φg(x),

implies that Φx naturally induces a map

˜Φx : [g] = gGx ∈ G/Gx 7→ Φgx ∈ Orb(x) ⊂ M .

(4.35)

That is, this map is well-deﬁned. ˜Φx is injective because if Φgx = Φhx then g−1h ∈ Gx,
so that gGx = hGx.

It follows from Section 4.2’s main theorem (i.e., R is a closed submanifold of M ×M

iﬀ M/G is a manifold with π : M → M/G a submersion) that:

(a): If Φ : G × M → M is an action and x ∈ M, then ˜Φx deﬁned by eq. 4.35 is an

Here we recall from Section 3.3.1 that injective immersions need not be embeddings.

(b): If also Φ is proper, the orbit Orb(x) is a closed submanifold of M and ˜Φx is
a diﬀeomorphism. In other words: the manifold structure of Orb(x) is given by the
bijective map [g] ∈ G/Gx 7→ g · x ∈ Orb(x) being a diﬀeomorphism.

injective immersion.

But:—

Examples:—

(We use the numbering of corresponding examples in Section 4.1.A):—

(i): G = SO(3) acts on M = IR3 by (A, x) 7→ Ax. Since Orb(x) is a sphere centred
at the origin of radius k x k, M/G ∼= IR+: which is not a manifold. But results (a) and
(b) are illustrated: the isotropy group Gx at x is the group of rotations with x on the
axis; the action is proper (for G is compact); the orbit Orb(x) is a closed manifold of
M; and the isotropy group’s cosets [g] ∈ G/Gx are mapped diﬀeomorphically by ˜Φx to
points on the sphere Orb(x).

(iii): Let X be the constant vector ﬁeld ∂x on M = IR3. X is complete. The action

65

of IR on M has as orbit through the point x = (x, y, z) ∈ IR3, the line y = constant, z =
constant. The action is free, and therefore faithful and the isotropy groups are trivial.
So G/Gx ≡ G. The action is proper. Again results (a) and (b) are illustrated: the
orbits Orb(x) are closed submanifolds of M, viz. copies of the real line IR = G ≡ G/Gx
that are diﬀeomorphic to IR by ˜Φx.

4.3.B A suﬃcient condition for the orbit space M/G to be a manifold With
result (b) from the end of Section 4.3.A,, we can prove that:

If Φ : G × M → M is a proper free action, then the orbit space M/G is a
manifold with π : M → M/G a submersion.

Examples: (again using the numbering in Section 4.1.A):—
(i): G = SO(3) acts on M = IR3 by (A, x) 7→ Ax. Since Orb(x) is a sphere centred
at the origin of radius k x k, M/G ∼= IR+: which is not a manifold, and indeed the
action is not free.

(iii): Let X be the constant vector ﬁeld ∂x on M = IR3. X is complete, and the
action of IR on M has as orbits the lines y = constant, z = constant. The action is
faithful, free and proper, so that the orbit space M/G is a manifold: M/G ∼= IR2.

(iv): Left (or right) translation is obviously a free action of a group G on itself, and
we noted above that it is proper. But since it is transitive, the orbit space G/G is the
trivial 0-dimensional manifold (the singleton set of G).

(viii): The cotangent lift of left (or right) translation by SO(3), or more generally,

by a Lie group G. This action is proper (noted after eq. 4.32), and obviously free.

(ix): The Euclidean group E acts freely on M := T ∗IR3N − (δ ∪ ∆). This action is

also proper: a (harder!) exercise for the reader.

4.4

Inﬁnitesimal generators of actions

We now connect this Subsection’s topic, group actions, with the Lie algebra of the Lie
group concerned, i.e. with the topic of Section 3.4, especially 3.4.2.

Let Φ : G × M → M be a (left) action by the Lie group G on a manifold M. Then

each ξ ∈ g deﬁnes an action of IR on M, which we write as Φξ, in the following way.

We can think either in terms of exponentiation of ξ’s corresponding left-invariant
vector ﬁeld Xξ (cf. eq. 3.8 and 3.47); or in terms of of exponentiating ξ itself (cf. eq.
3.50 and 3.51):

Φξ : IR × M → M : Φξ(τ, x) := Φ(exp(τ Xξ), x) ≡ Φ(exp(τ ξ), x).

(4.36)

That is, in terms of our subscript notation for the original action Φ (cf. eq. 4.1):
Φexp(τ Xξ) ≡ Φexp(τ ξ) : M → M is a ﬂow on M.

That the ﬂow is complete, i.e. that an action of all of IR is deﬁned, follows from
(2) Exponentiation again of Section 3.4.2, especially after eq. 3.48. Cf. also example
(iii) of Section 4.1.

66

We say that the corresponding vector ﬁeld on M, written ξM , i.e. the vector ﬁeld

deﬁned at x ∈ M by

ξM (x) :=

|τ =0 Φexp(τ Xξ)(x) ≡

|τ =0 Φexp(τ ξ)(x)

(4.37)

d
dτ

d
dτ

is the inﬁnitesimal generator of the action corresponding to ξ.

In terms of the map Φx deﬁned in eq. 4.34, we have that for all ξ ∈ g

ξM (x) = (TeΦx)(ξ) .

(4.38)

So NB: the words ‘inﬁnitesimal generator’ are used in diﬀerent, though related,
ways. In Remark (2) at the end of Section 3.4.2, a vector ﬁeld on the group G, or an
element ξ ∈ g, was called an ‘inﬁnitesimal generator’. Here the inﬁnitesimal generator
is a vector ﬁeld on the action-space M. Similarly, beware the notation: ξM is a vector
ﬁeld on M, while Xξ is a vector ﬁeld on G.

As an example, we again take the rotation group SO(3) acting on IR3: (A, x) ∈
SO(3) × IR 7→ Ax. One readily checks that with ω ∈ IR3, so that Θ(ω) ∈ so(3), the
inﬁnitesimal generator of the action corresponding to ξ ≡ Θ(ω) is the vector ﬁeld on
IR3

ξIR3(x) ≡ (Θ(ω))IR3(x) = ω ∧ x .
(4.39)
In particular, the vector ﬁeld on IR3 representing inﬁnitesimal anti-clockwise rotation
about the x-axis is e1 := y∂z −z∂y (cf. eq. 3.79). Similarly, the inﬁnitesimal generators
of the action of rotating about the y axis and about the z-axis are, respectively: e2 :=
z∂x − x∂z and e3 := x∂y − y∂x. The Lie brackets are given by:

[e1, e2] = −e3

[e3, e1] = −e2

[e2, e3] = −e1.

(4.40)

The minus signs here are a general feature of the transition ξ ∈ g 7→ ξM ∈ X (M); cf.
result (4) below.

As another example, we take the inﬁnitesimal generator of left and right transla-
tion on the group G. (We will need this example for our theorems about symplectic
reduction; cf. Sections 6.5.3, 7.2 and 7.3.3.) NB: There will be a “left-right ﬂip” here,
which continues the discussion in (4) of Section 3.4.2.B, comparing using left-invariant
vs. right-invariant vector ﬁelds to deﬁne the Lie algebra of a Lie group.
For left translation Φ(g, h) ≡ Lgh := gh, we have for all ξ ∈ g:

Φξ(τ, h) = (exp τ ξ)h = Rh(exp τ ξ) ;

so that the inﬁnitesimal generator is

(4.41)

(4.42)

So ξG is a right-invariant vector ﬁeld; and unless G is abelian, it is not equal to the
left-invariant vector ﬁeld g 7→ Xξ(g) := (TeLg)ξ; cf. eq. 3.40 and 3.42.

ξG(g) = (TeRg)ξ .

67

Similarly, for right translation (which is a right action, cf. (1) (iv) in Section 4.1.A),

the inﬁnitesimal generator is the left-invariant vector ﬁeld

g 7→ Xξ(g) := (TeLg)ξ .

(4.43)

Three straightforward results connect the notion of an inﬁnitesimal generator with
previous ideas. I will not give proofs, but will present them in the order of the previous
ideas.

(1): Recall the correspondence between Lie subgroups and Lie subalgebras, at the
end of Section 3.4.3; eq. 3.69. This implies that the Lie algebra of the isotropy group
Gx, x ∈ M (called the isotropy algebra), is

gx = {ξ ∈ g : ξM (x) = 0} .

(4.44)

(2): Inﬁnitesimal generators ξM give a diﬀerential version of the notion of equivari-

ance, discussed in (1) of Section 4.2: a version called inﬁnitesimal equivariance.

In eq. 4.29, we set g = exp(τ ξ) and diﬀerentiate with respect to τ at τ = 0. This
gives T f ◦ ξM = ξN ◦ f . That is: ξM and ξN are f -related. In terms of the pullback f ∗
of f , we have: f ∗ξN = ξM .

(3): Suppose the action Φ is proper, so that by result (b) at the end of Section
4.3.A: the orbit Orb(x) of any point x ∈ M is a (closed) submanifold of M. Then the
tangent space to Orb(x) at a point y in Orb(x) is

T Orb(x)y = {ξM (y) : ξ ∈ g} .

(4.45)

Finally, there is a fourth result relating inﬁnitesimal generators ξM to previous
its proof

ideas; as follows. (But it is less straightforward than the previous (1)-(3):
requires the notion of the adjoint representation, described in the next Section.)

(4): The inﬁnitesimal generator map ξ 7→ ξM establishes a Lie algebra anti-
homomorphism between g and the Lie algebra XM of all vector ﬁelds on M. (Contrast
the Lie algebra isomorphism between g and the set XL(G) of left-invariant vector ﬁelds
on the group G; Section 3.4.2 especially eq. 3.42.) That is:

(aξ + bη)M = aξM + bηM ;

[ξM , ηM ] = −[ξ, η]M ∀ξ, η ∈ g, and a, b ∈ IR.

(4.46)

Incidentally, returning to (4) of Section 3.4.2.B, which considered deﬁning the Lie
algebra of a Lie group in terms of right-invariant vector ﬁelds, instead of left-invariant
vector ﬁelds: had we done so, the corresponding map ξ 7→ ξM would have been a Lie
algebra homomorphism.

4.5 The adjoint and co-adjoint representations

A leading idea of later Sections (especially Sections 5.4, 6.4 and 7) will be that there is
a natural symplectic structure in the orbits of a certain natural representation of any

68

Lie group: namely a representation of the group on the dual of its own Lie algebra,
called the co-adjoint representation. Here we introduce this representation. But we
lead up to it by ﬁrst describing the adjoint representation of a Lie group on its own
Lie algebra. Even apart from symplectic structure (and so applications in mechanics),
both representations illustrate the ideas of previous Subsections. I will again use SO(3)
and so(3) as examples.

4.5.1 The adjoint representation

We proceed in four stages. We ﬁrst deﬁne the representation, then discuss inﬁnitesimal
generators, then discuss matrix Lie groups, and ﬁnally discuss the rotation group.

(1): The representation deﬁned:—

Let G be a Lie group and g its Lie algebra, i.e. the tangent space to the group at the
identity e ∈ G, equipped with the commutator bracket operation [, ].

Recall (e.g. from the beginning of Section 3.4.2) that G acts on itself by left and

right translation: each g ∈ G deﬁnes diﬀeomorphisms of G onto itself by

Lg : h ∈ G 7→ gh ∈ G ; Rg : h ∈ G 7→ hg ∈ G.

(4.47)

The induced maps of the tangent spaces are, for each h ∈ G:

Lg∗ : T Gh → T Ggh and Rg∗ : T Gh → T Ghg.

(4.48)

The diﬀeomorphism Kg := Rg−1 ◦ Lg (i.e. conjugation by g, Kg : h 7→ ghg−1) is an
inner automorphism of G. (Cf. example (v) at the end of Section 4.1.) Its derivative
at the identity e ∈ G is a linear map from the Lie algebra g to itself, which is denoted:

Adg := (Rg−1 ◦ Lg)∗e : g → g.

(4.49)

So letting g vary through G, the map Ad : g 7→ Adg assigns to each g a member of
End(g), the space of linear maps on (endomorphisms of) g. The chain rule implies that
Adgh = AdgAdh. So

Ad : g 7→ Adg

(4.50)

is a left action, a representation, of G on g: G × g → g.
representation.

It is called the adjoint

Three useful results about Ad follow from our results (1) and (3) in Section 3.4.2.B

(cf. eq. 3.52: Homomorphisms respect exponentiation):

[1]: If ξ ∈ g generates the one-parameter subgroup H = {exp(τ Xξ) : τ ∈ IR}, then

Adg(ξ) generates the conjugate subgroup Kg(H) = gHg−1.

exp(Adg(ξ)) = Kg(exp ξ) := g(exp ξ)g−1.

(4.51)

Incidentally, eq. 4.51 has a many-parameter generalization. Let H and H ′ be two
connected r-dimensional Lie subgroups of the Lie group G, with corresponding Lie

69

(4.52)

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

(4.56)

(4.57)

subalgebras h and h′ of the Lie algebra g = g(G). Then H and H ′ are conjugate
subgroups, H ′ = gHg−1, iﬀ h and h′ are corresponding conjugate subalgebras, i.e.
h′ = Adg(h).

[2]: Eq. 4.51 also implies another result which will be needed for a crucial result
about symplectic reduction, in Section 6.5.2. (The many-parameter generalization just
mentioned will not be needed.) It relates Ad to the pullback of an arbitrary action Φ.

Thus let Φ be a left action of G on M. Then for every g ∈ G and ξ ∈ g

where Φ∗ indicates pullback of the vector ﬁeld. For we have:

(Adgξ)M = Φ∗

g−1ξM ,

Φ∗

g−1ξM

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Not only is this result needed later. Also, incidentally: it is the main part of the proof
of result (4) at the end of Section 4.4, that ξ 7→ ξM is a Lie algebra anti-homomorphism.

[3]: Adg is an algebra homomorphism, i.e.

Adg[ξ, η] = [Adgξ, Adgη]

, ξ, η ∈ g.

(4.58)

(2): Inﬁnitesimal generators: the map ad:—

The map Ad is diﬀerentiable.
Its derivative at e ∈ G is a linear map from the Lie
algebra g to the space of linear maps on g. This map is called ad, and its value for
argument ξ ∈ g is written adξ. That is:

ad := Ad∗e : g → Endg ; adξ =

|τ =0 Adexp(τ ξ)

(4.59)

where exp(τ ξ) is the one-parameter subgroup with tangent vector ξ at the identity.
But if we apply the deﬁnition eq. 4.37 of the inﬁnitesimal generator of an action, to
the adjoint action Ad, we get that for each ξ ∈ g, the generator ξg, i.e. a vector ﬁeld
on g, is

ξg : η ∈ g 7→ ξg(η) ∈ g with ξg(η) :=

|τ =0 Adexp(τ ξ)(η).

(4.60)

Comparing eq. 4.59, we see that adξ is just the inﬁnitesimal generator ξg of the adjoint
action corresponding to ξ:

(4.61)

d
dτ

d
dτ

adξ = ξg .

70

We now compute the inﬁnitesimal generators of the adjoint action. It will be crucial
to later developments (especially Section 5.4) that these are given by the Lie bracket
in g.

We begin by considering the function Adexp(τ ξ)(η) to be diﬀerentiated. By eq. 4.49,

we have

Adexp(τ ξ)(η) = Te(Rexp(−τ ξ) ◦ Lexp(τ ξ))(η)
= (Texp(τ ξ)(Rexp(−τ ξ)) ◦ TeLexp(τ ξ))(η)
= (Texp(τ ξ)(Rexp(−τ ξ)) · Xη(exp(τ ξ))

(4.62)

where the second line follows by the chain rule, and the third by deﬁnition of left-
invariant vector ﬁeld. Writing the ﬂow of Xξ as φτ (g) = g exp τ ξ = Rexp(τ ξ)g, and
applying the deﬁnition of the Lie derivative (eq. 3.17), we then have

ξg(η) :=

|τ =0 Adexp(τ ξ)(η) =

dτ

Tφτ (e)φ−1

· Xη(φτ (e))

|τ =0

= [Xξ, Xη](e) = [ξ, η].

(cid:3)

(4.63)

where the ﬁnal equation is the deﬁnition eq. 3.45 of the Lie bracket in the Lie algebra.

So for the adjoint action, the inﬁnitesimal generator corresponding to ξ is taking

the Lie bracket: η 7→ [ξ, η]. To sum up: eq. 4.59 and 4.60 now become

ad = Ad∗e : g → Endg ; adξ =

|τ =0 Adexp(τ ξ) = ξg : η ∈ g 7→ [ξ, η] ∈ g.

(4.64)

d
dτ

(3): Example: matrix Lie groups:—

In the case where G ⊂ GL(n, IR) is a matrix Lie group with Lie algebra g ⊂ gl(n),
these results are easy to verify. Writing n × n matrices as A, B ∈ G, conjugation is
KA(B) = ABA−1, and the adjoint map Ad is also given by conjugation

AdA(X) = AXA−1, A ∈ G, X ∈ g.

So with A(τ ) = exp(τ X), so that A(0) = I and A′(0) = X, we have with Y ∈ g

But diﬀerentiating A(τ )A−1(τ ) = I yields

and so A−1′

(4.67)

d

so that indeed we have

d

|τ =0 Adexp τ XY = XY − Y X = [X, Y ].

(4.68)

(4): Example: the rotation group:—

It is worth giving details for the case of G = SO(3), g = so(3). We saw in Section
3.4.4 (eq. 3.79) that the three matrices

Ax = 

cal space IR3. To calculate the adjoint action of Rx
θ on the generator Ay, we diﬀerentiate
the product Rx

− sin θ 0 cos θ

−θ with respect to τ and set τ = 0. That is, we ﬁnd

θ = 



We similarly ﬁnd

AdRx

θ (Ax) = Ax, AdRx

θ (Az) = − sin θ · Ay + cos θ · Az.

(4.72)

So the adjoint action of the subgroup Rx
θ representing rotations around the x-axis of
physical space is given by rotations around the Ax-axis in the Lie algebra space so(3).
Similarly for the other subgroups representing rotations around the y or z-axis. And
so for any rotation matrix R ∈ SO(3), relative to given axes x, y, z for IR3, its adjoint
map AdR acting on so(3) ∼= IR3 has the same matrix representation relative to the
induced basis {Ax, Ay, Az} of so(3). (NB: This agreement between SO(3)’s adjoint
representation and its natural physical interpretation is special to SO(3): it does not
hold for other matrix Lie groups.)

Finally, the inﬁnitesimal generators of the adjoint action are given by diﬀerentiation.

For example, using eq. 4.71, we ﬁnd that

adAx(Ay) :=

|θ=0 AdRx

θ Ay = Az ;

d
dθ

(4.73)

which agrees with the commutator: Az = [Ax, Ay].

4.5.2 The co-adjoint representation

Again we proceed in stages. We ﬁrst deﬁne the representation, then discuss inﬁnitesi-
mal generators, and then take the rotation group as an example.

72

(1): The representation deﬁned:—

We recall that a linear map A : V → W induces (basis-independently) a transpose
(dual) map, written A∗ (or ˜A or AT ), A∗ : W ∗ → V ∗ on the dual spaces, V ∗ := {α :
V → IR | α linear } and similarly for W ∗; by

∀α ∈ W ∗, ∀v ∈ V : A∗(α)(v) ≡ < A∗(α) ; v > := α(A(v)) ≡ (α ◦ A)(v) .

(4.74)

So any representation, R say, of a group G on a vector space V , R : G → End(V ),
induces a representation R∗ of G on the dual space V ∗, by taking the transpose. We
shall call R∗ the dual or transpose of R; it is also sometimes called a ‘contragredient
representation’. That is: for R(g) : V → V , we deﬁne R∗(g) : V ∗ → V ∗ by

R∗(g) : α ∈ V ∗ 7→ R∗(g)(α) := α(R(g)) ∈ V ∗ .

(4.75)

Thus the adjoint representation of G on g induces a co-adjoint representation of G
on the dual g∗ of its Lie algebra g, i.e. on the cotangent space to the group G at the
identity, g∗ = T ∗
e G. The co-adjoint representation will play a central role in symplectic
reduction (starting in Section 5.4).

So let Ad∗

g : g∗ → g∗ be the dual (aka: transpose) of Adg, deﬁned by

∀α ∈ g∗, ξ ∈ g : < Ad∗

gα; ξ > := < α; Adgξ > .

(4.76)

Since Ad : g 7→ Adg is a left action (Adgh = AdgAdh), the assignment g 7→ Ad∗
g is a
right action. So to deﬁne a left action, we use the inverse g−1; cf. eq. 4.2 and 4.11.
Namely, we deﬁne the left action

(g, α) ∈ G × g∗ 7→ Ad∗

g−1α ∈ g∗ ;

(4.77)

called the co-adjoint action of G on g∗. And the corresponding co-adjoint representation
of G on g∗ is denoted by

Ad∗ : G → End(g∗), Ad∗

g−1 = (Te(Rg ◦ Lg−1))∗ .

(4.78)

(2): The map ad∗; inﬁnitesimal generators:—

The map Ad∗ is diﬀerentiable. Its derivative at e ∈ G is a linear map from the Lie
algebra g to the space of linear maps on g∗. This map is called ad∗, and its value for
argument ξ ∈ g is written ad∗

ξ is an endomorphism of g∗, and we have

ξ. Thus ad∗

ad∗ = Ad∗

∗e : ξ ∈ g → ad∗

ξ ∈ Endg∗ .

(4.79)

Now recall our deduction from eq. 4.59 and 4.60 that adξ = ξg, i.e. eq. 4.61. In the
same way we here deduce an equality to the inﬁnitesimal generator of the co-adjoint
action:

(4.80)

ad∗

ξ = ξg∗ .

73

In fact, ad∗

ξ is, modulo a minus sign, the adjoint of adξ, in the usual sense of the
natural pairing of a vector space with its dual: as we now show. (So the notation ad∗
is justiﬁed, modulo a minus sign.)

Let us compute for this action, the value of the inﬁnitesimal generator ξg∗ (a vector
ﬁeld on g∗, induced by ξ ∈ g) at the point α ∈ g∗. That is, we will compute the value
ξg∗(α). As usual, we identify the tangent space (T g∗)α in which this value lives, with
g∗ itself; and similarly for g. So, with ξg∗ acting on η ∈ g, we compute:

< ad∗

ξ(α); η > ≡ < ξg∗(α); η > =

|τ =0 Ad∗

exp −τ ξ(α); η

(4.83)

d
dτ

(cid:28)

So ad∗

ξ, deﬁned as the derivative of Ad∗ is, up to a sign, the adjoint of adξ.

(3): Example: the rotation group:—

Let us now write the elementary vector product in IR3 as ∧, and identify so(3) ∼=
(IR3, ∧) and so(3)∗ ∼= IR3∗
. And let us have the natural pairing given by the elementary
euclidean inner product ·. Then the result just obtained (now with • marking the
argument-place)

< ξg∗(α); • >= − < α; [ξ, •] >

becomes for α ∈ so(3)∗ and ξ ∈ so(3)

(4.84)

(4.85)

ξso(3)∗(α) · • = −α · (ξ ∧ •) .

So for η ∈ so(3), we have

In short:

< ξso(3)∗(α); η > = ξso(3)∗(α) · η = −α · (ξ ∧ η) = −(α ∧ ξ) · η = − < α ∧ ξ; η > . (4.86)

ξso(3)∗(α) = −α ∧ ξ = ξ ∧ α.

(4.87)

Now since SO(3) is compact, we know that the co-adjoint action is proper; so
Orb(α) is a closed submanifold of so(3)∗, and eq. 4.45 of Section 4.4 applies. So if we
ﬁx α, and let ξ vary through so(3) ∼= IR3, we get all of the tangent space TαOrb(α) to
the orbit passing through α. Then eq. 4.87 implies that the tangent space is the plane
normal to α, and passing through α’s end-point. Letting α vary through so(3)∗, we
conclude that the co-adjoint orbits are the spheres centred on the origin.

In the following Sections, we will see that the orbits of the co-adjoint representa-
tion of any Lie group G have a natural symplectic structure. So the orbits are always
even-dimensional; and by considering all Lie groups and all possible orbits, we can get
a series of examples of symplectic manifolds.

74

Besides, this fact will play a central role in our generalized formulation of Hamil-
tonian mechanics, and in symplectic reduction. And we will (mercifully!) get a good
understanding of that role, already in Section 5.1. To prepare for that, it is worth
gathering some threads about our recurrent example, SO(3); and generalizing them to
other Lie groups ...

4.6 Kinematics on Lie groups

To summarize some aspects of this Section, and to make our later discussion of reduc-
tion clearer, it is worth collecting and generalizing some of our results about SO(3)
and the description it provides of the rigid body. More precisely, we will now combine:
(i): the description of space and body coordinates in terms of left and right trans-

lation, at the end of Section 3.4.4;

(ii): the cotangent lift of translation (example (viii) of Section 4.1.A);
(iii): the adjoint and co-adjoint representations of SO(3) (as in (4) of Section 4.5.1,

and (3) of Section 4.5.2.

We will also generalize: namely, we will consider (i) to (iii) for an arbitrary Lie
group G, not just for SO(3). (The point of doing so will become clear in (3) of Section
5.1.) This will occur already in Section 4.6.1. Then in Section 4.6.2, we will show how
this material yields natural diﬀeomorphisms

T G → G × g and T ∗G → G × g∗ ;

(4.88)

(so if dimG = n, then all four manifolds are 2n-dimensional). We will also see that by
applying Section 4.2’s notion of equivariance, we can “pass to the quotients”, and get
from eq. 4.88, the natural diﬀeomorphisms

T G/G → g and T ∗G/G → g∗ ;

(4.89)

where the quotients on the left hand sides (the domains) is by the action of left trans-
lation; (to be precise: by the action of its derivative for T G, and its cotangent lift for
T ∗G).

4.6.1 Space and body coordinates generalized to G

So let a (ﬁnite-dimensional) Lie group G act on itself by left and right translation, Lg
and Rg. For any g ∈ G, we deﬁne

λg : TgG → g by v ∈ TgG 7→ (TeLg)−1(v) ≡ (TgLg−1)(v) ∈ g .

(4.90)

We similarly deﬁne

ρg : v ∈ TgG 7→ (TeRg)−1(v) ≡ (TgRg−1)(v) ∈ g .

(4.91)

75

On analogy with the case of the pivoted rigid body (cf. eq. 3.85 and 3.86, or eq. 4.22),
we say that λg represents v ∈ TgG in body coordinates, and ρg represents v in space
coordinates. We also speak of body and space representations. The transition from
body to space coordinates is then an isomorphism of g; viz. by eq. 4.49

∀ξ ∈ g, (ρg ◦ λ−1

g )(ξ) = ρg(TeLg(ξ)) ≡ Adgξ .

(4.92)

So we can combine the S and B superscript notation of eq. 4.22 with Section 4.5.1’s
notion of the adjoint representation, and write

vS = AdgvB .

(4.93)

In a similar way, the cotangent lifts of left and right translation provide isomor-

phisms between the dual spaces T ∗

g G, g ∈ G and g∗. Thus for any g ∈ G, we deﬁne

¯λg : T ∗

g G → g∗ by α ∈ T ∗

g G 7→ α ◦ TeLg ≡ (TeLg)∗(α) ≡ (T ∗

e Lg)(α) ∈ g∗ ;

(4.94)

and similarly

g G 7→ α ◦ TeRg ≡ (T ∗
And we again use the S and B superscript notation of eq. 4.22, and deﬁne for α ∈ T ∗

e Rg)(α) ∈ g∗ .

¯ρg : α ∈ T ∗

(4.95)

αS := (T ∗

e Rg)(α) ≡ ¯ρg(α) and αB := (T ∗

e Lg)(α) ≡ ¯λg(α) ,

which are called the space (or ‘spatial’) and body representations, respectively, of α.
The transition from body to space representations is now an isomorphism of g∗; viz.

∀α ∈ g∗, (¯ρg ◦ ¯λ−1

g )(α) = Ad∗

g−1(α) ,

i.e. αS = Ad∗

g−1(αB) .

(4.97)

(4.96)

4.6.2 Passage to the quotients

For later purposes, we need to develop the details of how the element g ∈ G “carries
along throughout” in eq. 4.90 to 4.97. More precisely, we have two isomorphisms:

T G ∼= G × g and T ∗G ∼= G × g∗ .

(4.98)

These are isomorphisms of vector bundles; but we shall not develop the language of
ﬁbre bundles. What matters for us is that once we exhibit these isomorphisms, we will
see that we have equivariant maps relating two group actions, in the sense of eq. 4.29
and 4.30. And this will mean that we can pass to the quotients to infer that T G/G is
diﬀeomorphic to g, and correspondingly that T ∗G/G is diﬀeomorphic to g∗.

This last diﬀeomorphism will form the ﬁrst part of Section 7’s main theorem, the
Lie-Poisson reduction theorem, which says that T ∗G/G and g∗ are isomorphic as Pois-
son manifolds. In Section 5 onwards, we will develop the notion of a Poisson manifold,
and the signiﬁcance of this isomorphism for the reduction of mechanical problems.

I should note here that there is a parallel story about the ﬁrst diﬀeomorphism, i.e.

76

about T G/G being diﬀeomorphic to g.
It forms the ﬁrst part of another reduction
theorem, which is the Lagrangian analogue of Section 7’s Lie-Poisson theorem. But
since this Chapter has adopted the Hamiltonian approach, I will not go into details.
They can be found in Marsden and Ratiu (1999: Sections 1.2, 13.5, 13.6), under the
title ‘Euler-Poincar´e reduction’.

Thus corresponding to eq. 4.90, we deﬁne the isomorphism

λ : T G → G × g by λ(v) := (g, (TeLg)−1(v)) ≡ (g, (TgLg−1)(v))

(4.99)

with v ∈ TgG, i.e. g = πG(v) and πG : T G → G the canonical projection.
(As
mentioned concerning eq. 4.6, it is harmless to (follow many presentations and) conﬂate
a point in T G, i.e. strictly speaking a pair (g, v), g ∈ G, v ∈ TgG, with its vector v.)
And corresponding to eq. 4.91, we deﬁne the isomorphism

ρ : T G → G × g by ρ(v) := (g, (TeRg)−1(v)) ≡ (g, (TgRg−1)(v)) .

(4.100)

The transition from body to space representations given by eq. 4.92 now implies

(ρ ◦ λ−1)(g, ξ) = ρ(g, TeLg(ξ)) = (g, (TeRg)−1 ◦ TeLg(ξ)) = (g, Adgξ).

(4.101)

In a similar way, the cotangent bundle T ∗G is isomorphic in two ways to G × g∗:

¯λ(α) := (g, α ◦ TeLg) ≡ (g, (T ∗

e Lg)α) ∈ G × g∗ ,

(4.102)

namely by

and by

¯ρ(α) := (g, α ◦ TeRg) ≡ (g, (T ∗

e Rg)α) ∈ G × g∗

(4.103)
G : T ∗G → G the canonical projection. (Again,

where α ∈ T ∗
G(α) with π∗
we harmlessly conﬂate a point (g, α) in T ∗G with its form α ∈ T ∗

g G, i.e. g = π∗

g G.)

Let us now compute in the body representation, the actions of: (i) the (derivative
of the) left translation map, T Lg, and (ii) the corresponding cotangent lift T ∗Lg. This
will show that λ and ¯λ are equivariant maps for certain group actions.

(i): We compute:

(λ ◦ T Lg ◦ λ−1)(h, ξ) = (λ ◦ T Lg)(h, T Lh(ξ)) = λ(gh, (T Lg ◦ T Lh)(ξ))
= (gh, ((T Lgh)−1 ◦ T Lgh)(ξ)) = (gh, ξ).

(4.104)
(4.105)

So in the body representation, left translation does not act on the vector component.
(That is intuitive, in that the vector ξ is “attached to the body” and so should not
vary relative to coordinates ﬁxed in it.) Eq. 4.105 means that λ is an equivariant
map relating left translation T Lg on T G to the G-action on G × g given just by left
translation on the ﬁrst component:

Φg((h, ξ)) ≡ g · (h, ξ) := (gh, ξ) .

(4.106)

77

Equivariance means that λ induces a map ˆλ on the quotients. That is: as in eq.

4.31, the map

ˆλ : T G/G → (G × g)/G

(4.107)

deﬁned as mapping, for any g, the orbit of any v ∈ TgG to the orbit of λ(v), i.e.

ˆλ : Orb(v) ≡ {u ∈ T G | TgLh(v) = u, some h ∈ G} 7→ Orb(λ(v))
≡ {(hg, (TeLg)−1(v)) | some h ∈ G}

(4.108)
(4.109)

is well-deﬁned, i.e. independent of the chosen representative v of the orbit.

Besides, since the canonical projections, v ∈ T G 7→ Orb(v) ∈ T G/G and (g, ξ) 7→
Orb((g, ξ)) ∈ (G × g)/G, are submersions, we can apply result (1) of Section 4.2 and
conclude that ˆλ is smooth.

Finally, we notice that since the action of left translation is transitive, we can
identify each orbit of the Φ of eq. 4.106 with its right component ξ ∈ g; and so we can
identify the set of orbits (G × g)/G with g.

To sum up: we have shown that T G/G and (G × g)/G, i.e. in eﬀect g, are diﬀeo-

morphic:

ˆλ : T G/G → (G × g)/G ≡ g .

(4.110)

(ii): The results for the cotangent bundle are similar to those in (i). On analogy
with eq. 4.105, the action of the cotangent lift of left translation T ∗Lg is given in body
representation by applying eq. 4.102 to get

(¯λ ◦ (T ∗Lg) ◦ ¯λ−1)(h, α) = (g−1h, α) ;

(4.111)

or equivalently, now taking the cotangent lift of left translation to deﬁne a left action
(cf. eq. 4.11),

(¯λ ◦ (T ∗Lg−1) ◦ ¯λ−1)(h, α) = (gh, α) .
So in body representation, left translation does not act on the covector component;
(again, an intuitive result in so far as α is “attached to the body”). So eq. 4.112 means
that ¯λ is an equivariant map relating the cotangent lifted left action of left translation
on T ∗G to the G-action on G × g∗ given just by left translation on the ﬁrst component:

(4.112)

Φg((h, α)) ≡ g · (h, α) := (gh, α) .

(4.113)

So, on analogy with eq. 4.107 and 4.109, we can pass to the quotients, deﬁning a map

ˆ¯λ : T ∗G/G → (G × g∗)/G

(4.114)

by requiring that for α ∈ T ∗

g G, so that T ∗Lh−1α ∈ T ∗

hgG:

Orb(¯λ(α)) ≡ {(hg, (T ∗

ˆ¯λ : Orb(α) ≡ {β ∈ T ∗G | β = T ∗Lh−1(α), some h ∈ G} 7→ (4.115)
e Lg)α) | some h ∈ G} .(4.116)

e Lg)(α)) | some h ∈ G} ≡ {(h, (T ∗

78

And ﬁnally, we identify the set of orbits (G × g∗)/G with g∗, so that we conclude
that T ∗G/G and g∗ are diﬀeomorphic. That is, we think of the diﬀeomorphism ˆ¯λ as
mapping T ∗G/G to g∗:

ˆ¯λ : Orb(α) ≡ {β ∈ T ∗G | β = T ∗Lh−1(α), some h ∈ G} ∈ T ∗G/G 7→ (T ∗

e Lg)(α) ∈ g∗.
(4.117)
As I said above, this diﬀeomorphism is the crucial ﬁrst part of Section 7’s main reduc-
tion theorem. But we will see its role there, already in (3) of Section 5.1.

Finally, a result which will not be needed later. To calculate the derivatives and
cotangent lifts of left translation in space representation, we replace λ and ¯λ by ρ and
¯ρ as deﬁned by eq. 4.100 and 4.103. We get as the analogues of eq. 4.105 and 4.111
respectively:

(ρ ◦ T Lg ◦ ρ−1)(h, ξ) = (gh, Adg(ξ)) ,

and

(¯ρ ◦ T ∗Lg ◦ ¯ρ−1)(h, α) = (g−1h, Ad∗

g(α)) .

Though these results are not needed later, they are also analogues of some later results,
eq. 6.89 and 6.90, which we will need. (Note that, in accordance with the discussion
between eq. 4.76 and 4.77, eq. 4.119 involves right actions.)

5 Poisson manifolds

5.1 Preamble: three reasons for Poisson manifolds

Now that we are equipped with Sections 3 and 4’s toolbox of modern geometry, we can
develop, in this Section and the two to follow, the theory of symplectic reduction. This
Section develops the general theory of Poisson manifolds, as a framework for a general-
ized Hamiltonian mechanics. Its main results concern the foliation, and quotienting, of
Poisson manifolds. Then Section 6 returns us to symmetries and conserved quantities:
topics which are familiar from Section 2.1.3, but which Section 6 will discuss in the
generalized framework using the notion of a momentum map. Finally, in Section 7 all
the pieces of our jigsaw puzzle will come together, in our symplectic reduction theorem.

We already glimpsed in (1) of Section 2.2 the idea of a Poisson manifold as a gen-
eralization of a symplectic manifold, that provides the appropriate framework for a
generalized Hamiltonian mechanics. It is a manifold equipped with a bracket, called a
‘Poisson bracket’, that has essentially the same formal deﬁning properties as in sym-
plectic geometry except that it can be “degenerate”. In particular, the dimension m
of a Poisson manifold M can be even or odd. As we will see, Hamiltonian mechanics
can be set up on Poisson manifolds, in a natural generalization of the usual formal-
ism: there are m ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations for the time evolution of
local coordinates x1, ..., xm, and the time-derivative of any dynamical variable (scalar

79

function on the Poisson manifold M) is given by its Poisson bracket with the Hamilto-
nian. Besides, this generalization reduces to the usual formalism in the following sense.
Any Poisson manifold M is foliated into symplectic manifolds, and any Hamiltonian
mechanics of our generalized kind deﬁned on M restricts on each symplectic leaf to a
conventional Hamiltonian mechanics using the induced symplectic form.

This last point, the invariance of the symplectic leaves under the dynamics, prompts
the question ‘why bother with the Poisson manifold, since the dynamics can be written
down on each leaf?’. There are three reasons. I will just mention the ﬁrst; the rest
of Section 5 will develop the second; and the two subsequent Sections will develop the
third.

(1): Parameters and stability:—

The ﬁrst two reasons concern the fact that for many problems in Hamiltonian mechan-
ics, it is natural to consider an odd-dimensional state-space. One principal way this
happens is if the system is characterized by some odd number, say s (maybe s = 1),
of parameters that are constant in time. Then even though for a ﬁxed value of the
parameter(s), there is a Hamiltonian mechanics on a symplectic manifold, of dimension
2n say, it is useful to envisage the 2n + s dimensional space in order to keep track of
how the behaviour of systems depends on the parameters. For example, this is very
useful for analysing stability, especially if one can somehow control the value of the pa-
rameters. Stability theory (and related ﬁelds such as bifurcation theory) are crucially
important, and vast, topics—which I will not go into.21

(2): Odd-dimensional spaces: the rigid body again:—

Secondly, even in the absence of such controllable parameters, there are mechanical
systems whose description leads naturally to an odd-dimensional state-space. The
paradigm elementary example is the rigid body pivoted at a point (mentioned in (3) of
Section 2.2). An elementary analysis, repeated in every textbook, leads to a descrip-
tion of the body by the three components of the angular momentum (relative to body
coordinates, i.e. coordinates ﬁxed in the body): these components evolve according to
the three ﬁrst-order Euler equations.

This situation prompts two foundational questions; (which of course most text-
books ignore!). First, we note that a conﬁguration of the body is given by three real
numbers: viz. to specify the rotation required to rotate the body into the given con-
ﬁguration, from a ﬁducial conﬁguration. So a conventional Hamiltonian description of
the rigid body would use six ﬁrst-order equations. (Indeed, similarly for a Lagrangian
description, if we treat the three ˙qs as variables.) So how is the description by Euler’s
equations related to a six-dimensional Hamiltonian (or indeed Lagrangian) description?
Second, can the description by the Euler equations be somehow regarded as itself

Hamiltonian, or Lagrangian?

21Except to note a broad philosophical point. These parameters illustrate the modal or coun-
terfactual involvements of mechanics. The s dimensions of the state-space, and the mathematical
constructions built on them, show how rich and structured these involvement are. For a detailed
discussion of the modal involvements of mechanics, cf. Butterﬁeld (2004).

80

This Chapter will not pursue these questions about the rigid body; for details, cf.
the references at the end of (3) of Section 2.2. For us, the important point is that
the theory of symplectic reduction shows that the answer to the second question is
Yes. Indeed, a “resounding Yes”. For we will see very soon (in Section 5.2.4.A) that
the three-dimensional space of the components, in body coordinates, of the angular
momentum is our prototype example of a Poisson manifold; and the evolution by
Euler’s equations is the Hamiltonian mechanics on each symplectic leaf of this manifold.
In short: in our generalized framework, Euler’s equations are already in Hamiltonian
form.

Furthermore, this Poisson manifold is already familiar: it is so(3)∗, the dual of the
Lie algebra of the rotation group. Here we connect with several previous discussions
(and this Chapter’s second motto).

First: we connect with the discussion of rotation in Relationist and Reductionist
mechanics (Sections 2.3.3 to 2.3.5). In particular, cf. comment (iii) about γ, the three
variables encoding the total angular momentum of the system, at the end of Section
2.3.4. (So as regards (1)’s idea of labelling the symplectic leaves by parameters constant
in time: in this example, it is the magnitude L of the total body angular momentum
which is the parameter.)

Second: we connect with Section 3.4.4’s discussion of so(3), with Section 4.5.2’s
discussion of the co-adjoint representation on so(3)∗, and with Section 4.6’s discussion
of kinematics on an arbitrary Lie group. As regards the rigid body, the main physical
idea is that the action of SO(3) on itself by left translation is interpreted in terms of
the coordinate transformation, i.e. rotation, between the space and body coordinate
systems.

But setting aside the rigid body: recall that in Section 4.5.2 we saw that for so(3)∗,
the co-adjoint orbits are the spheres centred on the origin. I also announced that they
have a natural symplectic structure—and that this was true for the orbits of the co-
adjoint representation of any Lie group. Now that we have the notion of a Poisson
manifold, we can say a bit more, though of course the proofs are yet to come:—

For any Lie group G, the dual of its Lie algebra g∗ is a Poisson manifold;
and G has on g∗ a co-adjoint representation, whose orbits are the symplectic
leaves of g∗ as a Poisson manifold.

In particular, we remark that the theory of the rigid body just sketched is inde-
it carries over to so(n)∗ for
pendent of the dimension of physical space being three:
any n. So we can readily do the Hamiltonian mechanics of the rigid body in arbitrary
dimensions. That sounds somewhat academic! But it leads to a more general point,
which is obviously of vast practical importance.

In engineering we often need to analyse or design bodies consisting of two or more
rigid bodies jointed together, e.g. at a universal joint. Often the conﬁguration space
of such a jointed body can be given by a sequence of rotations (in particular about
the joints) and-or translations from a ﬁducial conﬁguration; so that we can take an

81

appropriate Lie group G as the body’s conﬁguration space. If so, we can try to mimic
our strategy for the rigid body, i.e. to apply the result just announced. And indeed,
for such bodies, the action of left translation, and so the adjoint and co-adjoint repre-
sentations of G on g and g∗, can often be physically signiﬁcant.

But leaving engineering aside, let us sum up this second reason for Poisson manifolds
as follows. For some mechanical systems the natural state-space for a Hamiltonian
mechanics is a Poisson manifold. And in the paradigm case of the rigid body, there is
a striking interpretation of the Poisson manifold’s leaves as the orbits of the co-adjoint
representation of the rotation group SO(3).

(3): Reduction:—

My ﬁrst two reasons have not mentioned reduction. But unsurprisingly, they have
several connections with the notion. Here I shall state just one main connection, which
links Section 4.6’s kinematics on Lie groups to our main reduction theorem: this will
be my third motivation for studying Poisson manifolds.

In short, the connection is that:—
(i): For various systems, the conﬁguration space is naturally taken to be a Lie group

G; (as we have just illustrated with the rigid body).

(ii): So it is natural to set up an orthodox Hamiltonian mechanics of the system
on the cotangent bundle T ∗G. But (as in the Reductionist procedure of Section 2.3.4)
it is also natural to quotient by the lift to the cotangent bundle of G’s action on itself
by left translation.

(iii): When we do this, the resulting reduced phase space T ∗G/G is a Poisson
manifold. Indeed it is an isomorphic copy of g∗. That is, we have an isomorphism of
Poisson manifolds: g∗ ∼= T ∗G/G. This is the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem.

I shall give a bit more detail about each of (i)-(iii).

(i): For various systems, any conﬁguration can be obtained by acting with an
element of the Lie group G on some reference conﬁguration which can itself be labelled
by an element of G, say the identity e ∈ G. So we take the Lie group G to be the
conﬁguration space. As mentioned in (3) of Section 2.2, there is even an inﬁnite-
dimensional example of this: the ideal ﬂuid.

(ii): So T ∗G is the conventional Hamiltonian phase space of the system. But G
acts on itself by left translation. We can then consider the quotient of T ∗G by the
cotangent lift of left translation. Intuitively, this is a matter of “rubbing out” the way
that T ∗G encodes (i)’s choice of reference conﬁguration. By passing to the quotients
as in Section 4.6, we infer that T ∗G/G is a manifold. But of course it is in general
not even-dimensional. For its dimension is 1
2dim(T ∗G) ≡ dim(G). So consider any
odd-dimensional G: for example, our old friend, the three-dimensional rotation group
SO(3).

(iii): But T ∗G/G is always a Poisson manifold. And it is always isomorphic as a
Poisson manifold to g∗, with its symplectic leaves being the co-adjoint orbits of g∗:
g∗ ∼= T ∗G/G.

82

I end this third reason for studying Poisson manifolds with two remarks about

examples.

The ﬁrst remark echoes the end of Section 4.5.2, where I said that by considering
all possible Lie groups and all the orbits of their co-adjoint representations, we get a
series of examples of symplectic manifolds. We can now put this together with the
notion of a Poisson manifold, and with the comment at the end of Section 3.4.3, that
every (ﬁnite-dimensional) Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of a Lie group. In short: we
get a series of examples of Poisson manifolds, in either of two equivalent ways: from
the dual g∗ of any (ﬁnite-dimensional) Lie algebra g; or from the quotient T ∗G/G
of the cotangent lift of left translation. In either case, the example is the co-adjoint
representation.

The second remark is that there are yet other examples of Poisson manifolds and
reductions.
Indeed, we noted one in Section 2.3.4: viz. the Reductionist’s reduced
phase space ¯M := M/E, obtained by quotienting the phase space M := T ∗IR3N −(δ∪∆)
by the (cotangent lift) of the action of the euclidean group E on IR3N . But I shall not
go into further details about this example; (for which cf. the Belot papers listed in
Section 2.3.1, and references therein). Here it suﬃces to note that this example is not of
the above form: IR3N is not E, and the action of E on IR3N is not left translation. This
of course echoes my remarks at the end of Section 1.2 that the theory of symplectic
reduction is too large and intricate for this Chapter to be more than an “appetizer”.

So much by way of motivating Poisson manifolds. The rest of this Section will
cover reasons (1) and (2); but reason (3), about reduction, is postponed to Sections 6
and 7. We give some basics about Poisson manifolds, largely in coordinate-dependent
language, in Section 5.2. In Section 5.3, we move to a more coordinate-independent
language and show that Poisson manifolds are foliated into symplectic manifolds. In
Section 5.4, we show that the leaves of the foliation of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra
g∗ are the orbits of the co-adjoint representation of G on g∗. Finally in Section 5.5,
we prove a general theorem about quotienting a Poisson manifold by the action of Lie
group, which will be important for Section 7’s main theorem.

5.2 Basics

In Sections 5.2.1 to 5.2.3, we develop some basic deﬁnitions and results about Pois-
son manifolds. This leads up to Section 5.2.4, where we see that the dual of any
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra has a natural (i.e. basis-independent) Poisson manifold
structure. Throughout, there will be some obvious echoes of previous discussions of
anti-symmetric forms, Poisson brackets, Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds and Lie brackets
(Sections 2.1 and 3.2). But I will for the most part not articulate these echoes.

83

5.2.1 Poisson brackets

A manifold M is called a Poisson manifold if it is equipped with a Poisson bracket
(also known as: Poisson structure). A Poisson bracket is an assignment to each pair
of smooth real-valued functions F, H : M → IR, of another such function, denoted by
{F, H}, subject to the following four conditions:—
(a) Bilinearity:

{aF + bG, H} = a{F, H} + b{G, H} ; {F, aG + bH} = a{F, G} + b{F, H} ∀a, b ∈ IR.
(5.1)

(b) Anti-symmetry:

(c) Jacobi identity:

(d) Leibniz’ rule:

{F, H} = −{H, F } .

(5.2)

{{F, H}, G} + {{G, F }, H} + {{H, G}, F } = 0 .

(5.3)

{F, H · G} = {F, H} · G + H · {F, G} .

(5.4)

In other words: M is a Poisson manifold iﬀ both: (i) the set F (M) of smooth scalar
functions on M, equipped with the bracket {, }, is a Lie algebra; and (ii) the bracket
{, } is a derivation in each factor.

Any symplectic manifold is a Poisson manifold. The Poisson bracket is deﬁned by

the manifold’s symplectic form; cf. eq. 2.18.

“Canonical” Example:—

Let M = IRm, m = 2n+l, with standard coordinates (q, p, z) = (q1, ..., qn, p1, ..., pn, z1, ..., zl).
Deﬁne the Poisson bracket of any two functions F (q, p, z), H(q, p, z) by

{F, H} := Σn

∂F
∂qi

∂H
∂pi −

∂F
∂pi

∂H
∂qi (cid:19)

.

i (cid:18)

Thus this bracket ignores the z coordinates; and if l were equal to zero, it would be
the standard Poisson bracket for IR2n as a symplectic manifold. We can immediately
deduce the Poisson brackets for the coordinate functions. Those for the qs and ps are
as for the usual symplectic case:

{qi, qj} = 0

{pi, pj} = 0

{qi, pj} = δij.

On the other hand, all those involving the zs vanish:

{qi, zj} = {pi, zj} = {zi, zj} ≡ 0.

Besides, any function F depending only on the z’s, F ≡ F (z) will have vanishing
Poisson brackets with all functions H : {F, H} = 0.

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

84

This example seems special in that M is foliated into 2n-dimensional symplectic
manifolds, each labelled by l constant values of the zs. But Section 5.3.4 will give a
generalization for Poisson manifolds of Darboux’s theorem (mentioned at the end of
Section 2.1.1): a generalization saying, roughly speaking, that every Poisson manifold
“looks locally like this”.

For any Poisson manifold, we say that a function F : M → IR is distinguished
or Casimir if its Poisson bracket with all smooth functions H : M → IR vanishes
identically: {F, H} = 0.

5.2.2 Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds

Given a smooth function H : M → IR, consider the map on smooth functions: F 7→
{F, H}. The fact that the Poisson bracket is bilinear and obeys Leibniz’s rule implies
that this map F 7→ {F, H} is a derivation on the space of smooth functions, and so
determines a vector ﬁeld on M; (cf. (ii) of Section 3.1.2.B). We call this vector ﬁeld the
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld associated with (also known as: generated by) H, and denote
it by XH.

But independently of the Poisson structure, the action of any vector ﬁeld XH on
a smooth function F , XH (F ), also equals LXH (F ) ≡ dF (XH); (cf. eq. 3.12). So we
have for all smooth F

LXH (F ) ≡ dF (XH) ≡ XH(F ) = {F, H} .

(5.8)

The equations describing the ﬂow of XH are called Hamilton’s equations, for the choice
of H as “Hamiltonian”.

In the previous example with M = IR2n+l, we have

XH = Σn

∂H
∂pi

∂
∂qi −

∂H
∂qi

∂
∂pi (cid:19)

,

i (cid:18)

(5.9)

and the ﬂow is given by the ordinary diﬀerential equations

dqi
dt

=

∂H
∂pi

dpi
dt

= −

∂H
∂qi

dzj
dt

= 0.

i = 1, ..., n; j = 1, ..., l.

(5.10)

Again, the zs, and any function F (z) solely of them, are distinguished and have a
vanishing Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld. On the other hand, the coordinate functions qi
and pi generate the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds − ∂

∂pi and ∂

∂qi respectively.

Two further remarks about eq. 5.8:—
(1): It follows that a function H is distinguished (i.e. has vanishing Poisson brackets
with all functions) iﬀ its Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH vanishes everywhere. And since
the Poisson bracket is antisymmetric, this is so iﬀ H is constant along the ﬂow of all
Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds.

(2): This equation is the beginning of the theory of constants of the motion (ﬁrst

85

integrals), and of Noether’s theorem, for Poisson manifolds; just as the corresponding
equation was the beginning for the symplectic case. This will be developed in Section
6.

Poisson brackets and Lie brackets:—

With the deﬁnition eq. 5.8 in hand, we can readily establish our ﬁrst important con-
nection between Poisson manifolds and Section 3’s Lie structures. Namely: result (2)
at the end of Section 3.2.2, eq. 3.32, is also valid for Poisson manifolds.

That is: the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld of the Poisson bracket of scalars F, H on a
Poisson manifold M is, upto a sign, the Lie bracket of the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds,
XF and XH, of F and H:

X{F,H} = −[XF , XH] = [XH , XF ]

.

(5.11)

The proof is exactly as for eq. 3.32.

So the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, with the Poisson bracket, form a Lie subalgebra
of the Lie algebra XM of all vector ﬁelds on the Poisson manifold M. This result will
be important in Section 5.3.3’s proof that every Poisson manifold is a disjoint union of
symplectic manifolds.

5.2.3 Structure functions

We show that to compute the Poisson bracket of any two functions given in some local
coordinates x = x1, ..., xm, it suﬃces to know the Poisson brackets of the coordinates.
For any function H : M → IR, let the components of its Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld in the
coordinate system x be written as hi(x). So XH = Σm
∂xi . Then for any other
function F , we have

i hi(x) ∂

{F, H} = XH(F ) = Σm

i hi(x)

∂F
∂xi .

Taking xi as the function F , we get: {xi, H} = XH(xi) = hi(x). So eq. 5.12 becomes

∂F
∂xi .
If we now put xi for H and H for F in eq. 5.13, we get

{F, H} = Σm

i {xi, H}

{xi, H} = −{H, xi} = −Xxi(H) = −Σm

j {xj, xi}

(5.14)

∂H
∂xj ..

Combining eq.s 5.13 and 5.14, we get the basic formula for the Poisson bracket of any
two functions in terms of the Poisson bracket of local coordinates:

{F, H} = Σm

i Σm

j {xi, xj}

∂F
∂xi

∂H
∂xj .

We assemble these basic brackets, which we call the structure functions of the Poisson
manifold,

J ij(x) := {xi, xj} i, j = 1, ..., m

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.15)

(5.16)

86

into a m × m anti-symmetric matrix of functions, J(x), called the structure matrix of
M. More precisely, it is the structure matrix for M relative to our coordinate system
x. Of course, the transformation of J under a coordinate change x′i := x′i(x1, ..., xm)
is determined by setting F := x′i, H := x′j in the basic formula eq. 5.15.

Then, writing ∇H for the (column) gradient vector of H, eq. 5.15 becomes

{F, H} = ∇F · J∇H.

(5.17)

For example, the canonical bracket on IR2n+l, eq.5.5, written in the (q, p, z) coordinates,
has the simple form

where I is the n × n identity matrix.

We can write the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, and the Hamilton’s equations, associated

with the function H in terms of J. Since

we get:

or in matrix notation: XH = (J∇H) · ∂x. Similarly, Hamilton’s equations

To summarize how we have generalized from the usual form of Hamilton’s equations:
compare eq. 5.22, 5.17 and 5.18 respectively with eq. 2.12, 2.18 and 2.3.

Note that not every m×m anti-symmetric matrix of functions on an m-dimensional
manifold (or even: on an open subset of IRm) is the structure matrix of a Poisson
manifold: for the Jacobi identity constrains the functions. In fact it is readily shown
that the Jacobi identity corresponds to the following m3 partial diﬀerential equations
governing the J ij(x), which are in general non-linear. Writing as usual ∂l for ∂/∂xl:

5.2.4 The Poisson structure on g∗

We can now show that any m-dimensional Lie algebra g deﬁnes a Poisson structure,
often called the Lie-Poisson bracket, on any m-dimensional vector space V . We proceed
in two stages.

(1): We ﬁrst present the deﬁnition in a way that seems to depend on a choice of
bases, both in g (where the deﬁnition makes a choice of structure constants) and in
the space V .

(2): Then we will see that choosing V to be g∗, the deﬁnition is in fact basis-

independent.

This Poisson structure on g∗ will be of central importance from now on. As
Marsden and Ratiu write:
‘Besides the Poisson structure on a symplectic manifold,
the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗, the dual of a Lie algebra, is perhaps the most funda-
mental example of a Poisson structure’ (1999: 415). Here we return to our motivating
discussion of Poisson manifolds, especially reasons (2) and (3) of Section 5.1: which
concerned the rigid body and reduction, respectively. Indeed, we will see already in the
Example at the end of this Subsection (Section 5.2.4.A) how the Lie-Poisson bracket
on the special case g∗ := so(3)∗ clariﬁes the theory of the rigid body. And we will
see in Sections 7.2 and 7.3.3 how for any g, the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗ is induced
by reduction, from the canonical Poisson (viz. symplectic) structure on the cotangent
bundle T ∗G. This will be our reduction theorem, that T ∗G/G ∼= g∗.

After (2), we will see that the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗ implies that Hamilton’s
equations on g∗ can be expressed using ad∗: a form that will be needed later. This will
be (3) below. Then we will turn in Section 5.2.4.A to the example g∗ := so(3)∗.

(1): A Poisson bracket on any vector space V :—

Take a basis, say e1, ..., em, in g, and so structure constants ck
ij (cf. eq. 3.24). Consider
the space V as a manifold, and coordinatize it by taking a basis, ǫ1, ..., ǫm say, deter-
mining coordinates x1, ..., xm. We now deﬁne the Poisson bracket (in this case, often
called the Lie-Poisson bracket) between two smooth functions F, H : V → IR to be

{F, H} := Σm

i,j,k=1 ck

ijxk ∂F
∂xi

∂H
∂xj .

This takes the form of eq. 5.15, with linear structure functions J ij(x) = Σm
ijxk. One
ck
k
easily checks that anti-symmetry, and the Jacobi identity, for the structure constants,
eq. 3.25, implies that these J ij are anti-symmetric and obey their Jacobi identity eq.
5.23. So eq. 5.24 deﬁnes a Poisson bracket on V .

In particular, the associated Hamiltonian equations, eq.s 5.21 and 5.22, take the

form

(5.24)

(5.25)

(2): The Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗:—

To give a basis-independent characterization of the Lie-Poisson bracket, we ﬁrst recall

dxi
dt

= Σm

j,k=1 ck

ijxk ∂H
∂xj .

88

that:

y ∈ V

(i): the gradient ∇F (x) of F : V → IR at any point x ∈ V is in the dual space V ∗

of (continuous) linear functionals on V ;:

isomorphic to its double dual: (V ∗)∗ ∼= V .

(ii): any ﬁnite-dimensional vector space is canonically, i.e. basis-independently,

Then writing < ; > for the natural pairing between V and V ∗, we have, for any

< ∇F (x); y >:= limτ →0

F (x + τ y) − F (x)
τ

.

(5.26)

Now let us take V in our deﬁnition of the Lie-Poisson bracket to be g∗. So we will
show that g makes g∗ a Poisson manifold, in a basis-independent way. And let the basis
ǫ1, ..., ǫm be dual to the basis e1, ..., em of g. If F : g∗ → IR is any smooth function, its
gradient ∇F (x) at any point x ∈ g∗ is an element of (g∗)∗ ∼= g. One now checks that
the Lie-Poisson bracket deﬁned by eq. 5.24 has the basis-independent expression

{F, H}(x) = < x; [∇F (x), ∇H(x)] > , x ∈ g∗

(5.27)

where [, ] is the ordinary Lie bracket on the Lie algebra g itself.

(3): Hamilton’s equations on g∗:—

We can also give a basis-independent expression of the Hamilton’s equations eq. 5.25:
viz. by expressing the Lie bracket in eq. 5.27 in terms of ad, as indicated by eq. 4.64.
Thus let F ∈ F (g∗) be an arbitrary smooth scalar function on g∗. By the chain

rule

dF
dt

But applying eq.s 4.64 and 4.83 to eq. 5.27 implies:

= DF (x) · ˙x =< ˙x; ∇F (x) > .

(5.28)

{F, H}(x) =< x; [∇F (x), ∇H(x)] >= − < x; ad∇H(x)(∇F (x)) >=< ad∗

∇H(x)(x); ∇F (x) > .

(5.29)
Since F is arbitrary and the pairing is non-degenerate, we deduce that Hamilton’s
equations take the form

dx
dt

= ad∗

∇H(x)(x) .

(5.30)

7.2.4.A Example: so(3) and so(3)∗ As an example of the dual of a Lie algebra as a
Poisson manifold, let us consider again our standard example so(3)∗. We will thereby
make good our promise in (2) of Section 5.1, to show that Euler’s equations for a rigid
body are already in Hamiltonian form—in our generalized sense. We will also see why
in the Chapter’s second motto, Arnold mentions the three dual spaces, IR3∗, so(3)∗ and
T ∗(SO(3))g; (cf. the discussion at the end of Section 3.4.4).

The Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3) has a basis e1, e2, e3 representing inﬁnitesimal ro-
tations around the x-, y- and z-axes of IR3. As we have seen, we can think of these
basis elements: as vectors in IR3 with [, ] as elementary vector multiplication; or as

89

anti-symmetric matrices with [, ] as the matrix commutator; or as left-invariant vector
ﬁelds on SO(3) with [, ] as the vector ﬁeld commutator (i.e. Lie bracket).

Let ǫ1, ǫ2, ǫ3 be a dual basis for so(3)∗, with x = x1ǫ1 + x2ǫ2 + x3ǫ3 a typical point

therein. If F : so(3)∗ → IR, its gradient at x is the vector

∂F
∂x2 e2 +
Then eq. 5.27 tells us that, if we write so(3) as IR3 with × for elementary vector
multiplication, the Lie-Poisson bracket on so(3)∗ is

∂F
∂x3 e3 ∈ so(3).

∂F
∂x1 e1 +

∇F =

So the structure matrix J(x) is

Hamilton’s equations corresponding to the Hamiltonian function H(x) are therefore

Now consider the Hamiltonian representing the kinetic energy of a free pivoted rigid

body

H(x) =

in which the Ii are the moments of inertia about the three coordinate axes, and the xi
are the corresponding components of the body angular momentum. For this Hamilto-
nian, Hamilton’s equations eq. 5.35 become

dx1

(5.37)

Indeed, these are the Euler equations for a free pivoted rigid body. I shall not go into
details about the rigid body. I only note that:

(i):

In the elementary theory of such a body, the magnitude L of the angular
momentum is conserved, and eq. 5.37 describes the motion of the xi on a sphere of
radius L centred at the origin.

(ii): In Section 5.4, we will return to seeing these spheres as the orbits of the co-

adjoint representation of SO(3) on so(3)∗ (cf. Section 4.5.2).

(iii): Let us sum up this theme by saying, with Marsden and Ratiu (1999, p.11)
‘a simple and beautiful Hamiltonian structure for the rigid body

that here we see:
equations’.

5.3 The symplectic foliation of Poisson manifolds

We ﬁrst reformulate some ideas of Section 5.2 in more coordinate-independent language,
starting with Section 5.2.3’s idea of the structure matrix J(x) (Section 5.3.1). Then
we discuss canonical transformations on a Poisson manifold (Section 5.3.2). This will
lead up to showing that any Poisson manifold is foliated by symplectic leaves (Section
5.3.3). Finally, we state a generalization of Darboux’s theorem; and again take so(3)
as an example (Section 5.3.4).

5.3.1 The Poisson structure and its rank

We now pass from the structure matrix J, eq. 5.16, to a coordinate-independent object,
the Poisson structure (also known as: co-symplectic structure), written B. Whereas J
multiplied naive gradient vectors, as in eq. 5.17 and 5.22, B is to map the 1-form dH
into its Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld; as follows.

At each point x in a Poisson manifold M, there is a unique linear map Bx, which

we will also write as B

such that

For the requirement eq. 5.39 implies, by eq. 5.20, that for each j = 1, ..., m

Since the diﬀerentials dxi span T ∗
one-form α = Σajdxj is:

x M, this ﬁxes Bx, by linearity. Bx’s action on any

so that Bx is essentially matrix multiplication by J(x). Here, compare again eq. 5.21
and 5.22.

Here we recall that any linear map between (real ﬁnite-dimensional) vector spaces,

B : V → W ∗, has an associated bilinear form B♯ on V × W ∗∗ ∼= V × W given by

Accordingly, some authors introduce the Poisson structure as a bilinear form B♯
x M → IR, often called the Poisson tensor. Thus eq. 5.42 gives, for α, β ∈ T ∗
x M ×T ∗
T ∗

x :
x M

B♯(v, w)

:= < B(v) ; w > .

B♯
x(α, β) := < B(α), β > .

B♯
x is antisymmetric, since the matrix J(x) is. So, if we now let x vary over M, we
can sum up in the traditional terminology of tensor analysis: B♯ is an antisymmetric
contravariant two-tensor ﬁeld.

In this example the form of B is the same from point to point.
kernel of B has everywhere the same dimension, viz.
coordinates.

In particular, the
l, the number of distinguished

We now deﬁne the rank at x of a Poisson manifold M to be the rank of its Poisson
structure B at x, i.e. the dimension of the range of Bx. This range is also the span of
all the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on M at x:

ran(Bx) := {X ∈ TxM : X = Bx(α), some α ∈ T ∗

x M} = {XH(x) : H : M → IR smooth } .

(5.46)
x M)=dim(M),

So the rank of M at x is also equal to the dimension of Bx’s domain, i.e. dim(T ∗
minus the dimension of the kernel, dim(Bx).

Since in local coordinates, Bx is given by multiplication by the structure matrix
J(x), the rank of M at x is the rank (the same in any coordinates) of the matrix J(x).
That J(x) is anti-symmetric implies that the rank of M is even: cf. again the normal
form of antisymmetric bilinear forms, eq. 2.2 and 2.3.

The manifold M being symplectic corresponds, of course, to the rank of B being

everywhere maximal, i.e. equal to dim(M).

In this case, the kernel of B is trivial, and any distinguished function H is constant
on M. For H is distinguished iﬀ XH = 0; and if the rank is maximal, then dH = 0, so
that H is constant.

Besides, each of the Poisson structure and symplectic form on M determine the
other. In particular, the Poisson tensor B♯ of eq. 5.43 is, up to a sign, the “contravariant
cousin” of M’s symplectic form ω. For recall: (i) the relation between a symplectic
manifold’s Poisson bracket and its form, eq. 2.18, viz.

{F, H} = dF (XH) = ω(XF , XH) ;

and (ii) eq. 5.8 for Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on a Poisson manifold, viz.

XH(F ) = {F, H} .

(5.47)

(5.48)

Applying these equations yields, if we start from eq. 5.43 and eq. 5.39:

B♯(dH, dF ) := < B(dH), dF >= dF (XH) = XH(F ) = {F, H} = ω(XF , XH) . (5.49)

We have also seen examples where the Poisson structure B is of non-maximal rank:
(i): In our opening “canonical” example, the Poisson bracket eq. 5.5 on M =

92

IR2n+l has rank 2n everywhere.

(ii): In the Lie-Poisson structure on so(3)∗, the rank varies across the manifold:
it is 2 everywhere, except at the origin x = 0 where it is 0. (Cf. the rank of the matrix
J in eq. 5.34.)

5.3.2 Poisson maps

Already at the beginning of our development of Poisson manifolds, we saw that a scalar
function H : M → IR deﬁnes equations of motion, with H as “Hamiltonian”, for all
other functions F : M → IR, of the familiar Poisson bracket type:

˙F = {F, H}.

(5.50)

(Cf. Section 5.2.2, especially the remarks around eq. 5.8.) We now develop the
generalization for Poisson manifolds of some related notions and results.

We say that a smooth map f : M1 → M2 between Poisson manifolds (M1, {, }1) and
(M2, {, }2) is Poisson or canonical iﬀ it preserves the Poisson bracket. To be precise:
we ﬁrst need the idea of the pullback of a function; cf. Section 3.1.2.A. In this context,
the pullback f ∗ of a function F : M2 → IR is given by

f ∗F := F ◦ f ;

i.e. f ∗F : x ∈ M1 7→ F (f (x)) ∈ IR.

(5.51)

Then we say that f : M1 → M2 is Poisson iﬀ for all smooth functions F, G : M2 → IR
(F, G ∈ F (M2))

f ∗{F, G}2 = {f ∗F, f ∗G}1 ;
where by the deﬁnition eq. 5.51, the lhs ≡ {F, G}2 ◦ f , and the rhs ≡ {F ◦ f, G ◦ g}1.

(5.52)

We note the special case where M1 = M2 =: M and M is symplectic; i.e. the
Poisson bracket is of maximal rank, and so deﬁnes a symplectic form on M, as in eq.
5.49. In this case, we return to the equivalence in Section ??’s usual formulation of
Hamiltonian mechanics, between preserving the Poisson bracket and preserving the
symplectic form. That is: a map f : M → M on a symplectic manifold M is Poisson
iﬀ it is symplectic.

Besides, we already have for symplectic manifolds an inﬁnitesimal version of the
idea of a Poisson or symplectic map: viz. the idea of a locally Hamiltonian vector
ﬁeld; cf. Section 2.1.3. Similarly for Poisson manifolds, we will need the corresponding
inﬁnitesimal version of a Poisson map; but not till Section 6.1.1.

One can show (using in particular the Jacobi identity) that the ﬂows of a Hamilto-
nian vector ﬁeld are Poisson. (Here of course, (M1, {, }1) = (M2, {, }2).) That is: if φτ
is the ﬂow of XH (i.e. φτ = exp(τ XH )), then

τ {F, G} = {φ∗
φ∗

τ F, φ∗

τ G}

i.e. {F, G} ◦ φτ = {F ◦ φτ , G ◦ φτ } .

(5.53)

Similarly, one can readily show the equivalent proposition, that along the ﬂow of a
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld the Lie derivative of the Poisson tensor B♯ vanishes. That is:

93

for any smooth function H : M → IR, we have:

LXH

B♯ = 0 .

(5.54)

Since preserving the Poisson bracket implies in particular preserving its rank, it

follows from eq. 5.53 (or from eq. 5.54) that:

If XH is a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld on a Poisson manifold M, then for any τ ∈ IR
and x ∈ M, the rank of M at exp(τ XH)(x) is the same as the rank at x. In other
words: Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are rank-invariant in the sense used in the general
form of Frobenius’ theorem (Section 3.3.2).

This result will be important for the foliation theorem for Poisson manifolds.

We will also need the result (also readily shown) that Poisson maps push Hamil-
let f : M1 → M2 be a
tonian ﬂows forward to Hamiltonian ﬂows. More precisely:
Poisson map; so that at each x ∈ M1, we have the derivative map on the tangent
space, T f : (T M1)x → (T M2)f (x). And let H : M2 → IR be a smooth function. If φτ
is the ﬂow of XH and ψτ is the ﬂow (on M1) of XH◦f , then:

φτ ◦ f = f ◦ ψτ and T f ◦ XH◦f = XH ◦ f .

5.3.3 Poisson submanifolds: the foliation theorem

To state the foliation theorem for Poisson manifolds, we need the idea of a Poisson
immersion, which leads to the closely related idea of a Poisson submanifold. In eﬀect,
these ideas combine the idea of a Poisson map with the ideas about injective immersions
in (2) of Section 3.3.1. We recall from that discussion that for an injective immersion,
f : N → M, the range f (N) is not necessarily a submanifold of M: but f (N) is
nevertheless called an ‘injectively immersed submanifold’ of M. (But as mentioned in
Section 3.3.2, many treatments ignore this point: they in eﬀect assume that an injective
immersion f is also an embedding, i.e. a homeomorphism between N and f (N), so
that f (N) is indeed a submanifold of M and f is a diﬀeomorphism.)

An injective immersion f : N → M, with M a Poisson manifold, is called a Poisson
immersion if any Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld deﬁned on an open subset of M containing
f (N) is in the range of the derivative map of f at y ∈ N, i.e. ran(Tyf ), at all points
f (y) for y ∈ N.

Being a Poisson immersion is equivalent to the following rather technical condition.

Characterization of Poisson immersions An injective immersion f :
N → M, with M a Poisson manifold, is a Poisson immersion iﬀ:

94

if F, G : V ⊂ N → IR, where V is open in N, and if ¯F , ¯G : U → IR are
extensions of F ◦ f −1, G ◦ f −1 : f (V ) → IR to an open neighbourhood U
of f (V ) in M, then { ¯F , ¯G} |f (V ) is well-deﬁned and independent of the
extensions.

The main point of this equivalence is that it ensures that if f : N → M is a Poisson
immersion, then N has a Poisson structure, and f : N → M is a Poisson map. It is
worth seeing how this comes about—by proving the equivalence.

Proof: Let f : N→M be a Poisson immersion, and let F, G : V ⊂ N→IR and let
¯F , ¯G : U ⊃ f (V ) → IR be extensions of F ◦ f −1, G ◦ f −1 : f (V ) → IR. Then for y ∈ V ,
there is a unique vector v ∈ T Ny such that

X ¯G(f (y)) = (Tyf )(v) .

(5.57)

So evaluating the Poisson bracket of ¯F and ¯G at f (y) yields, by eq. 5.8,

{ ¯F , ¯G}(f (y)) = d ¯F (f (y))·X ¯G(f (y)) = d ¯F (f (y))·(Tyf )(v) = d( ¯F ◦f )(y)·v ≡ dF (y)·v .
(5.58)
So { ¯F , ¯G}(f (y)) is independent of the extension ¯F of F ◦f −1. Since the Poisson bracket
is antisymmetric, it is also independent of the extension ¯G of G ◦ f −1. So we can deﬁne
a Poisson structure on N by deﬁning for any y in an open V ⊂ N

{F, G}N (y) := { ¯F , ¯G}M (f (y)) .

(5.59)

This makes f : N→M a Poisson map, since for any ¯F , ¯G on M and any y ∈ N, we
have that

[f ∗{ ¯F , ¯G}M ](y) ≡ [{ ¯F , ¯G}M ◦ f ](y) = {F, G}N (y) ≡ {f ∗ ¯F , f ∗ ¯G}N (y) ;

(5.60)

where the middle equality uses eq. 5.59.

For the converse implication, assume that eq. 5.58 holds, and let H : U→IR be
a Hamiltonian deﬁned on an open subset U of M that intersects f (N). Then as we
have just seen, N is a Poisson manifold and f : N→M is a Poisson map. Because f is
Poisson, it pushes XH◦f to XH. That is: eq. 5.55 implies that if y ∈ N is such that
f (y) ∈ U, then

XH(f (y)) = (Tyf )(XH◦f (y)) .

(5.61)

So XH(f (y)) is in the range of Tyf ; so f : N→M is a Poisson immersion. QED.

Now suppose that the inclusion id : N → M is a Poisson immersion. Then we call
N a Poisson submanifold of M. We emphasise, in line with the warning we recalled
from (2) of Section 3.3.1, that N need not be a submanifold of M; but it is nevertheless
called an ‘injectively immersed submanifold’ of M.

From the deﬁnition of a Poisson immersion, it follows that any Hamiltonian vector
ﬁeld must be tangent to a Poisson submanifold. In other words: writing X for the
system of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on M, and X |x for their values at x ∈ M, we

95

have: if N is a Poisson submanifold of M, and x ∈ N, X |x⊂ T Nx.

For the special case where M is a symplectic manifold, we have X |x= TxM, and

the only Poisson submanifolds of M are its open sets.

Finally, we deﬁne the following equivalence relation on a Poisson manifold M.
Two points x1, x2 ∈ M are on the same symplectic leaf if there is a piecewise smooth
curve in M joining them, each segment of which is an integral curve of a locally
deﬁned Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld. An equivalence class of this equivalence relation is a
symplectic leaf.

We can now state and prove that Poisson manifolds are foliated.

7.3.3.A Foliation theorem for Poisson manifolds The result is:—

A Poisson manifold M is the disjoint union of its symplectic leaves. Each
symplectic leaf is an injectively immersed Poisson submanifold, and the
induced Poisson structure on the leaf is symplectic. The leaf through the
point x, Nx say, has dimension equal to the rank of the Poisson structure
at x; and the tangent space to the leaf at x equals

T Nx = ran(Bx) := {X ∈ TxM : X = Bx(α), some α ∈ T ∗

x M} (5.62)
= {XH(x) : H ∈ F (U), U open in M } (5.63)

Proof: We apply the general form of Frobenius’ theorem (Section 3.3.2) to the
system X of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds on M. We know from eq. 5.11 (Section 5.2.2)
that X is involutive, and from eq. 5.53 above that it is rank-invariant. So by Frobenius’
theorem, X is integrable. The integral submanifolds are by deﬁnition given by the rhs
of eq. 5.63. QED.

One also readily shows that:
(i): One can evaluate the Poisson bracket of F, G : M → IR at x ∈ M by restricting
F and G to the symplectic leaf Nx through x, and evaluating the Poisson bracket that
is deﬁned by the symplectic form on the leaf Nx; (i.e. the Poisson bracket deﬁned in
eq. 2.18).

(ii): A distinguished function is constant on any symplectic leaf Nx of M.

We end with two remarks. The ﬁrst is a mathematical warning; the second concerns

physical interpretation.

(1): Recall our warning that symplectic leaves need not be submanifolds. This also
means that all the distinguished functions being constants does not imply that the
Poisson structure is non-degenerate. Indeed, one can readily construct an example in
which the symplectic leaves are not manifolds, all distinguished functions are constants,
and the Poisson structure is degenerate. Namely, one adapts an example mentioned
before, in Section 3.4.3: the ﬂows on the torus T2 that wind densely around it. (For
more details about this example, cf. Arnold (1973: 160-167) or Arnold (1989: 72-74)
or Butterﬁeld (2004a: Section 2.1.3.B); for how to adapt it, cf. Marsden and Ratiu

96

(1999: 347).

(2): As we have seen, any integral curve of any Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH is
conﬁned to one of the symplectic leaves. So if we are interested only in the behaviour
of a single solution through a point x ∈ M, we can restrict our attention to the
symplectic leaf Nx through x:
for the solution will always remain in Nx. But as
stressed in Section 5.1, there are at least three good reasons not to ignore the more
general Poisson structure!

5.3.4 Darboux’s theorem

At the end of Section 2.1.1, we mentioned Darboux’s theorem: it said that any sym-
plectic manifold “looks locally like” a cotangent bundle. The generalization for Poisson
manifolds says that any Poisson manifold “looks locally like” our canonical example
on IRm, m = 2n + l, given at the start of Section 5.2.1. More precisely, we have:

Let M be an m-dimensional Poisson manifold, and let x ∈ M be a point
with an open neighbourhood U ⊂ M throughout which the rank is a con-
stant 2n ≤ m. Then deﬁning l := m − 2n, there is a possibly smaller neigh-
bourhood U ′ ⊂ U of x, on which there exist local coordinates (q, p, z) =
(q1, ..., qn, p1, ..., pn, z1, ..., zl), for which the Poisson bracket takes the form

{F, H} := Σn

∂F
∂qi

∂H
∂pi −

∂F
∂pi

∂H
∂qi (cid:19)

.

i (cid:18)

(5.64)

(So the Poisson brackets for the coordinate functions take the now-familiar
form given by eq. 5.6 and 5.7.) The symplectic leaves of M intersect the
coordinate chart in the slices {z1 = c1, . . . , zl = cl} given by constant values
of the distinguished coordinates z.

We shall not give the proof. Suﬃce it to say that:
(i): Like Darboux’s theorem for symplectic manifolds: it proceeds by induction on
the “half-rank” n; and it begins by taking any function F as the “momentum” p1 and
constructing the canonically conjugate coordinate q1 such that {q1, p1} = 1.

(ii): The induction step invokes a version of Frobenius’ theorem in which the fact
that the rank 2n is constant throughout U secures a coordinate system in which the
2n-dimensional integral manifolds are given by slices deﬁned by constant values of
the remaining l coordinates. The Poisson structure then secures that these remaining
coordinates are distinguished.

7.3.4.A Example: so(3)∗ yet again We illustrate (1) the foliation theorem and (2)
Darboux’s theorem, with so(3)∗; whose Lie-Poisson structure we described in Section
5.2.4.A.

(1): At x ∈ so(3)∗, the subspace X |x:= {XH(x) : H ∈ F (U), U open in M } of
values of locally Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds is spanned by e1 := y∂z − z∂y representing

97

inﬁnitesimal rotation about the x-axis (cf. eq. ??); e2 := z∂x − x∂z for rotation about
the y-axis; and e3 := x∂y − y∂x for rotation about the z-axis. If x 6= 0, these vectors
span a two-dimensional subspace of T so(3)∗
x: viz. the tangent plane to the sphere S|x|
of radius | x | centred at the origin. So the foliation theorem implies that so(3)∗’s
symplectic leaves are these spheres; and the origin.

We can compute the Poisson bracket of F, G : S|x|→IR by extending F and G
to a neighbourhood of S|x|; cf.
5.59. That is: we can consider extensions
¯F , ¯G : U ⊃ S|x|→IR, and calculate the Poisson bracket in so(3)∗, whose Poisson struc-
ture we already computed in eq. 5.33.

eq.

Adopting spherical polar coordinates with r =| x |, i.e. x1 = r cos θ sin φ, x2 =
r sin θ sin φ, x3 = r cos φ, we can deﬁne ¯F , ¯G merely by ¯F (r, θ, φ) := F (θ, φ), ¯G(r, θ, φ) :=
G(θ, φ); so that the partial derivatives with respect to the spherical angles θ, φ are equal,
i.e. ¯Fθ = Fθ, ¯Fφ = Fφ, ¯Gθ = Gθ, ¯Gφ = Gφ.

Besides, eq. 5.15 implies that we need only calculate the Poisson bracket in so(3)∗

of the spherical angles θ and φ. So eq. 5.33 gives

and eq. 5.59 and 5.15 give

{θ, φ} = −x · (∇θ × ∇φ) =

−1
r sin φ

;

{F, G} = { ¯F , ¯G} =

(FθGφ − FφGθ) .

−1
r sin φ

(5.65)

(5.66)

(2): z := x3 deﬁnes the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld Xz = x2∂x1 − x1∂x2 that generates
clockwise rotation about the z ≡ x3-axis. So away from the origin the polar angle
θ := arctan(x2/x1) has a Poisson bracket with z equal to: {θ, z} = Xz(θ) = −1.
Exprssing F, H : so(3)∗→IR in terms of the coordinates z, θ and r :=| x |, we ﬁnd
that the Lie-Poisson bracket is: {F, H} = FzHθ − FθHz. So (z, θ, r) are canonical
coordinates.

5.4 The symplectic structure of the co-adjoint representation

Section 5.2.4 described how the dual g∗ of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of a Lie
group G has the structure of a Poisson manifold. In this case, the foliation established
in the previous Subsection has an especially neat interpretation. Namely: the leaves
are the orbits of the co-adjoint representation of G on g∗.

This symplectic structure in the co-adjoint representation sums up themes from
Sections 4.5 (especially 4.5.2), and 5.2.4 and 5.3. In particular, it connects two prop-
erties of the Lie bracket in g, which we have already seen: viz.

(i): The Lie bracket in g gives the inﬁnitesimal generators of the adjoint action; cf.

eq. 4.64.

(ii): The Lie bracket in g deﬁnes (in a basis-independent way) a Lie-Poisson bracket
on g∗, thus making g∗ a Poisson manifold. (Cf. the deﬁnition in eq. 5.24, shown to be
basis-independent by eq. 5.27.)

98

In fact, there is a wealth of instructive results and examples about the structure of
the co-adjoint representation: we will only scratch the surface—as in other Sections!
We will give a proof, under a simplifying assumption, of one main result; and then
make a few remarks about other results.

The result is:

The orbits of the co-adjoint representation are g∗’s leaves
Let G be a Lie group, with its co-adjoint representation Ad∗ on g∗. That
is, recalling eq. 4.78, we have:

Ad∗ : G → End(g∗), Ad∗

g−1 = (Te(Rg ◦ Lg−1))∗ .

(5.67)

The orbits of this representation are the symplectic leaves of g∗, taken as
equipped with its natural Poisson structure, i.e. the Lie-Poisson bracket
eq. 5.27.

Proof:— We shall prove this under the simplifying assumption that the co-adjoint action
of G on g∗ is proper. (We recall from the deﬁnition of proper actions, eq. 4.32, that
for any compact Lie group, such as SO(3), this condition is automatically satisﬁed.)
Then we know from result (3) and eq. 4.45, at the end of Section 4.4, that this implies
that the co-adjoint orbit Orb(α) of any α ∈ g∗ is a closed submanifold of g∗, and that
the tangent space to Orb(α) at a point β ∈ Orb(α) is

T Orb(α)β = { ξg∗(β) : ξ ∈ g } .
We will see shortly how this assumption implies that g∗’s symplectic leaves are sub-
manifolds.22

(5.68)

We now argue as follows. For ξ ∈ g, consider the scalar function on g∗, Kξ : α ∈
g∗ 7→ Kξ(α) := < α; ξ > ∈ IR; and its Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XKξ. At each α ∈ g∗,
∼= g, is just ξ
the gradient ∇Kξ(α) ≡ dKξ(α), considered as an element of (T ∗g∗)α
itself. Now we will compute XKξ(F )(α) for any F : g∗ → IR and any α ∈ g∗, using in
order:

(i): the intrinsic deﬁnition of the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗, eq. 5.27;
(ii): the fact that the inﬁnitesimal generator of the adjoint action is the Lie bracket

in g, eq. 4.64;

(iii): the fact that the derivative ad∗ of the co-adjoint action Ad∗ is, up to a sign,

the adjoint of adξ; eq. 4.83.

Thus we get, for all F : g∗→IR and α ∈ g∗:

XKξ(F )(α) ≡ {F, Kξ}(α) = < α ; [∇F (α), ∇Kξ(α)] >
= < α ; [∇F (α), ξ] > = − < α ; [ξ, ∇F (α)] >
= − < α ; adξ(∇F (α)) >
ξ(α) ; ∇F (α) > .

(5.69)
(5.70)
(5.71)
(5.72)
22To verify that our condition is indeed simplifying—i.e. that in general the co-adjoint orbits in
g∗ are not submanifolds—consider the example in Marsden and Ratiu (1999: 14.1.(f), p. 449); taken
from Kirillov (1976: 293).

= < ad∗

99

But on the other hand, the vector ﬁeld XKξ is uniquely determined by its action on all
such functions F at all α ∈ g∗:

XKξ(F )(α) ≡ < XKξ(α) ; ∇F (α) > .

So we conclude that at each α ∈ g∗:

XKξ = ad∗
ξ .

(5.73)

(5.74)

But the subspace X |α of values at α of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds is spanned by the
XKξ(α), with ξ varying through g. And as ξ varies through g, ad∗
ξ(α) is the tangent
space T Orb(α)α to the co-adjoint orbit Orb(α) of G through α. So

X |α= T Orb(α)α .

(5.75)

So the integral submanifolds of the system X of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds, which are
the symplectic leaves of g∗ by Section 5.3.3.A’s foliation theorem, are the co-adjoint
orbits. QED.

For the illustration of this theorem by our standard example, so(3)∗, cf. our previous
discussions of it: in Section 4.5.2 for its co-adjoint structure; in Section 5.2.4.A for its
Lie-Poisson structure; and in Section 5.3.4.A for its symplectic leaf structure.

We end this Subsection by stating two other results. They are not needed later,

but they are enticing hints of how rich is the theory of co-adjoint orbits.

(1): For each g ∈ G, the co-adjoint map Ad∗

g : g∗→g∗ is a Poisson map that

preserves the symplectic leaves of g∗.

(2): A close cousin of the theorem just proven is that the Lie bracket on g deﬁnes
(via its deﬁnition of the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗, eq. 5.27) a symplectic form, i.e. a
non-degenerate closed two-form, on each co-adjoint orbit, by:

ω(α)(ad∗

ξ(α), ad∗

η(α))

:= < α ; [ξ, η]g > , ∀α ∈ g∗, ∀ξ, η ∈ g .

(5.76)

This theorem is proven in detail (without our simplifying assumption that G’s action
is proper) by Marsden and Ratiu (1999: Thm 14.3.1, pp. 453-456); and much more
brieﬂy by Arnold (1989: 321, 376-377, 457); and rather diﬀerently (even without using
the notion of a Poisson manifold!) in Abraham and Marsden (1978: 302-303).

5.5 Quotients of Poisson manifolds

We now end Section 5 with the simplest general theorem about quotienting a Lie group
action on a Poisson manifold, so as to get a quotient space (set of orbits) that is itself a
Poisson manifold. So this theorem combines themes from Sections 4—in particular, the
idea from Section 4.3.B that for a free and proper group action, the orbits and quotient
space are manifolds—with material about Poisson manifolds from Section 5.2. (The
material in Sections 5.3 and 5.4 will not be needed.) This theorem will be important
in Section 7. We call this result the

100

Poisson reduction theorem: Suppose the Lie group G acts on Poisson
manifold M is such a way that each Φg : M → M is a Poisson map.
Suppose also that the quotient space M/G is a manifold and the projection
π : M → M/G is a smooth submersion (say because G’s action on M is free
and proper, cf. Section 4.3.B). Then there is a unique Poisson structure on
M/G such that π is a Poisson map. The Poisson bracket on M/G is called
the reduced Poisson bracket.

Proof: Let us ﬁrst assume that M/G is a Poisson manifold and that π is a Poisson
map; and show uniqueness. We ﬁrst note that for any f : M/G → IR, the function
¯f := f ◦ π : M → IR is obviously the unique G-invariant function on M that projects
by π to f . That is: if [x] ≡ Orb(x) ≡ G · x is the orbit of x ∈ M, then ¯f assigns the
same value f ([x]) to all elements of the orbit [x]. Besides, in terms of pullbacks (eq.
5.51), ¯f = π∗f .

Then the condition that π be Poisson, eq. 5.52, is that for any two smooth scalars

f, h : M/G → IR, we have an equation of smooth scalars on M:

{f, h}M/G ◦ π = {f ◦ π, h ◦ π}M = { ¯f, ¯h}M

(5.77)

where the subscripts indicate on which space the Poisson bracket is deﬁned. Since π
is surjective, eq. 5.77 determines the value {f, h}M/G uniquely.

But eq. 5.77 also deﬁnes {f, h}M/G as a Poisson bracket; in two stages. (1): The

facts that Φg is Poisson, and ¯f and ¯h are constant on orbits imply that

{ ¯f, ¯h}(g · x) = ({ ¯f , ¯h} ◦ Φg)(x) = { ¯f ◦ Φg, ¯h ◦ Φg}(x) = { ¯f , ¯h}(x).

(5.78)

That is: { ¯f, ¯h} is also constant on orbits, and so deﬁnes {f, h} uniquely.

(2): We show that {f, h}, as thus deﬁned, is a Poisson structure on M/G, by
checking that the required properties, such as the Jacobi identity, follow from the
Poisson structure { , }M on M. QED.

This theorem is a “prototype” for material to come. We spell this out in two brief

remarks, which look forward to the following two Sections.

(1): Other theorems:— This theorem is one of many that yield new Poisson mani-
folds and symplectic manifolds from old ones by quotienting. In particular, as we will
see in detail in Section 7, this theorem is exempliﬁed by the case where M = T ∗G (so
here M is symplectic, since it is a cotangent bundle), and G acts on itself by left trans-
lations, and so acts on T ∗G by a cotangent lift. In this case, we will have M/G ∼= g∗;
and the reduced Poisson bracket just deﬁned, by eq. 5.77, will be the Lie-Poisson
bracket we have already met in Section 5.2.4.

(2): Reduction of dynamics:— Using this theorem, we can already ﬁll out a little
what is involved in reduced dynamics; which we only glimpsed in our introductory
discussions, in Section 2.3 and 5.1. We can make two basic points, as follows.

(A): If H is a G-invariant Hamiltonian function on M, it deﬁnes a corresponding
function h on M/G by H = h ◦ π. The fact that Poisson maps push Hamiltonian ﬂows

101

forward to Hamiltonian ﬂows (eq. 5.55) implies, since π is Poisson, that π transforms
XH on M to Xh on M/G. That is:

T π ◦ XH = Xh ◦ π ;

(5.79)

i.e. XH and Xh are π-related. Accordingly, we say that the Hamiltonian system XH
on M reduces to that on M/G.

(B): We shall see in Section 6.2 that G-invariance of H is associated with a family
of conserved quantities (constants of the motion, ﬁrst integrals), viz. a constant of the
motion J(ξ) : M → IR for each ξ ∈ g. Here, J being conserved means {J, H} = 0; just
as in our discussion of Noether’s theorem in ordinary Hamiltonian mechanics (Section
2.1.3). Besides, if J is also G-invariant, then the corresponding function j on M/G is
conserved by Xh since

{j, h} ◦ π = {J, H} = 0 implies {j, h} = 0 .

(5.80)

6 Symmetry and conservation revisited: momen-

tum maps

We now develop the topics of symmetry and conserved quantities (and so Noether’s
theorem) in the context of Poisson manifolds. At the centre of these topics lies the idea
of a momentum map of a Lie group action on a Poisson manifold; which we introduce in
Section 6.1. This is the modern geometric generalization of a conserved quantity, such
as linear or angular momentum for the Euclidean group—hence the name. Formally,
it will be a map J from the Poisson manifold M to the dual g∗ of the Lie algebra of the
symmetry group G. Since its values lie in a vector space, it has components. So our
description of conserved quantities will no longer be “one-dimensional”, i.e. focussed
on a single vector ﬁeld in the state space, as it was in Sections ?? and ??. The map
J will be associated with a linear map J from g to F (M), the scalar functions on
for each ξ ∈ g, J(ξ) will be a conserved quantity if the
the manifold M. That is:
Hamiltonian H is invariant under the inﬁnitesimal generator ξM , i.e. if ξM (H) = 0.

The conservation of momentum maps will be expressed by the Poisson manifold
version of Noether’s theorem (Section 6.2), and illustrated by the familiar examples
of linear and angular momentum (Section 6.3). Then we discuss the equivariance of
momentum maps, with respect to the co-adjoint representation of G on g∗; Section
6.4. Finally in Section 6.5, we discuss the crucial special case of momentum maps on
cotangent bundles, again with examples.

6.1 Canonical actions and momentum maps

We ﬁrst apply the deﬁnition of Poisson maps (from Section 5.3.2) to group actions
(Section 6.1.1). This will lead to the idea of the momentum map (Section 6.1.2).

102

6.1.1 Canonical actions and inﬁnitesimal generators

Let G be a Lie group acting on a Poisson manifold M by a smooth left action Φ :
G × M → M; so that as usual we write Φg : x ∈ M 7→ Φg(x) := g · x ∈ M. As in the
deﬁnition of a Poisson map (eq. 5.52), we say the action is canonical if

Φ∗

g{F1, F2} = {Φ∗

gF1, Φ∗

gF2}

(6.1)

for any F1, F2 ∈ F (M) and any g ∈ G. If M is symplectic with symplectic form ω,
then the action is canonical iﬀ it is symplectic, i.e. Φ∗

gω = ω for all g ∈ G.

We will be especially interested in the inﬁnitesimal version of this notion; and so
with inﬁnitesimal generators of actions. We recall from eq. 4.37 that the inﬁnitesimal
generator of the action corresponding to a Lie algebra element ξ ∈ g is the vector ﬁeld
ξM on M obtained by diﬀerentiating the action with respect to g at the identity in the
direction ξ:

ξM (x) =

[exp(τ ξ) · x] |τ =0 .

d
dτ

So we diﬀerentiate eq. 6.1 with respect to g in the direction ξ, to give:

ξM ({F1, F2}) = {ξM (F1), F2} + {F1, ξM (F2)} .

(6.2)

(6.3)

Such a vector ﬁeld ξM is called an inﬁnitesimal Poisson automorphism.

Side-remark:— We will shortly see that it is the universal quantiﬁcation over g ∈ G
in eq. 6.1, and correspondingly in eq. 6.3 and 6.5 below, that means our description
of conserved quantities is no longer focussed on a single vector ﬁeld; and in particular,
that a momentum map representing a conserved quantity has components.

In the symplectic case, diﬀerentiating Φ∗

gω = ω implies that the Lie derivative
LξM ω of ω with respect to ξ vanishes: LξM ω = 0. We saw in Section 2.1.3 that
this is equivalent to ξM being locally Hamiltonian, i.e.
there being a local scalar
J : U ⊂ M → IR such that ξM = XJ . This was how Section 2.1.3 vindicated eq.
2.19’s “one-liner” approach to Noether’s theorem: because the vector ﬁeld Xf is locally
Hamiltonian, it preserves the symplectic structure, i.e. Lie-derives the symplectic form
LXf ω = 0—as a symmetry should.

We also saw in result (2) at the end of Section 3.2.2 that the “meshing”, up to a
sign, of the Poisson bracket on scalars with the Lie bracket on vector ﬁelds implied that
the locally Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds form a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra X (M) of
all vector ﬁelds.

Turning to the context of Poisson manifolds, we need to note two points. The ﬁrst

is a similarity with the symplectic case; the second is a contrast.

(1): One readily checks, just by applying eq. 6.3, that the inﬁnitesimal Poisson
automorphisms are closed under the Lie bracket. So we write the Lie algebra of these
vector ﬁelds as P(M): P(M) ⊂ X (M).

(2): On the other hand, Section 2.1.3’s equivalence between a vector ﬁeld being
locally Hamiltonian and preserving the geometric structure of the state-space breaks

103

down.

Agreed, the ﬁrst implies the second: a locally Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld preserves the
Poisson bracket. We noted this already in Section 5.3.2. The diﬀerential statement was
B♯ = 0 (eq. 5.54). The ﬁnite
that such a ﬁeld XH Lie-derives the Poisson tensor: LXH
statement was that the ﬂows of such a ﬁeld are Poisson maps: φ∗
τ {F, G} = {φ∗
τ G}
(eq. 5.53).

τ F, φ∗

But the converse implication fails: an inﬁnitesimal Poisson automorphism on a
Poisson manifold need not be locally Hamiltonian. For example, make IR2 a Poisson
manifold by deﬁning the Poisson structure

{F, H} = x

∂F
∂x

∂H
∂y

(cid:18)

−

∂H
∂x

∂F
∂y (cid:19)

;

(6.4)

then the vector ﬁeld X = ∂/∂y in a neighbourhood of a point on the y-axis is a non-
Hamiltonian inﬁnitesimal Poisson automorphism.

This point will aﬀect the formulation of Noether’s theorem for Poisson manifolds,

in Section 6.2.

Nevertheless, we shall from now on be interested in cases where for all ξ, ξM is

globally Hamiltonian. This means there is a map J : g→F (M) such that

XJ(ξ) = ξM

(6.5)

for all ξ ∈ g. There are three points we need to note about this condition.

(1): Since the right hand side of eq. 6.5 is linear in ξ, we can require such a J to
be a linear map. For given any J obeying eq. 6.5, we can take a basis e1, . . . , em of g
and deﬁne a new linear ¯J by setting, for any ξ = ξiei, ¯J (ξ) := ξiJ(ei).

(2): Eq. 6.5 does not determine J(ξ). For by the linearity of the map B : dJ(ξ) 7→
XJ(ξ), we can add to such a J(ξ) any distinguished function, i.e. an F : M → IR such
that XF = 0. That is: XJ(ξ)+F ≡ XJ(ξ). (Of course, in the symplectic case, the only
distinguished functions are constants.)

(3): It is worth expressing eq. 6.5 in terms of Poisson brackets. Recalling that for

any F, H ∈ F (M), we have XH (F ) = {F, H}, this equation becomes

{F, J(ξ)} = ξM (F ) , ∀F ∈ F (M), ∀ξ ∈ g .

We will also need the following result:

XJ([ξ,η]) = X{J(ξ),J(η)}M .

To prove this, we just apply two previous results, each giving a Lie algebra anti-
homomorphism.

(i): Result (4) at the end of Section 4.4: for any left action of Lie group G on any
manifold M, the map ξ 7→ ξM is a Lie algebra anti-homomorphism between g and the
Lie algebra XM of all vector ﬁelds on M:

(aξ + bη)M = aξM + bηM ;

[ξM , ηM ] = −[ξ, η]M ∀ξ, η ∈ g, and a, b ∈ IR.

(6.8)

(6.6)

(6.7)

104

(ii): The “meshing” up to a sign, just as in the symplectic case, of the Poisson
bracket on scalars with the Lie bracket on vector ﬁelds, as in eq. 5.11 at the end of
Section 5.2.2:

X{F,H} = −[XF , XH] = [XH , XF ]

.

(6.9)

So for a Poisson manifold M, the map F ∈ F (M) 7→ XF ∈ X (M) is a Lie algebra
anti-homomorphism.

Applying (i) and (ii), we deduce eq. 6.7 by:

XJ([ξ,η]) = [ξ, η]M = −[ξM , ηM ] = −[XJ(ξ), XJ(η)] = X{J(ξ),J(η)}M .

(6.10)

6.1.2 Momentum maps introduced

So suppose that there is a canonical left action of G on a Poisson manifold M. And
suppose there is a linear map J : g → F (M) such that

XJ(ξ) = ξM

(6.11)

for all ξ ∈ g.

The two requirements—that the action be inﬁnitesimally canonical (i.e. each ξM ∈
P(M)) and that each ξM be globally Hamiltonian—can be expressed as requiring that
there be a J : g → F (M) such that there is a commutative diagram. Namely, the map
ξ ∈ g 7→ ξM ∈ P(M) is to equal the composed map:

Then the map J : M → g∗ deﬁned by

g J−→ F (M)

F 7→XF−→ P(M) .

< J(x) ; ξ > := J(ξ)(x)

(6.12)

(6.13)

for all ξ ∈ g and x ∈ M, is called the momentum map of the action.

Another way to state this deﬁnition is as follows. Any smooth function J : M → g∗
deﬁnes at each ξ ∈ g a scalar J(ξ) : x ∈ M 7→ (J(x))(ξ) ∈ IR. By taking J(ξ) as a
Hamiltonian function, one deﬁnes a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XJ(ξ). But since G acts
on M, each ξ ∈ g deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld on M, viz. ξM . So we say that J is a momentum
map for the action if for each ξ ∈ g, these two vector ﬁelds are identical: XJ(ξ) = ξM .

Three further remarks by way of illustrating this deﬁnition:—
(1): An isomorphism:— One readily checks that eq. 6.13 deﬁnes an isomorphism
between the space of smooth maps J from M to g∗, and the space of linear maps J
from g to scalar functions F (M). We can take J to deﬁne J by saying that at each
x ∈ M, J(x) : ξ ∈ g 7→ J(x)(ξ) ∈ IR is to be given by the composed map

g J−→ F (M)

|x−→ IR ,

(6.14)

105

where |x means evaluation at x ∈ M. Or we can take J to deﬁne J by saying that at
each ξ ∈ g, J(ξ) : x ∈ M 7→ J(ξ)(x) ∈ IR is to be given by the composed map

M

J
−→ g∗

|ξ−→ IR ,

(6.15)

where |ξ means evaluation at ξ ∈ g.

(2): Diﬀerential equations for the momentum map:— Using Hamilton’s equations,
we can readily express the deﬁnition of momentum map as a set of diﬀerential equations.
Recall that on a Poisson manifold, Hamilton’s equations are determined by eq. 5.39,
which was that at each x ∈ M

Bx(dH(x)) = XH(x) ;

or in local coordinates xi, i = 1, . . . , m ≡ dim(M), with J ij(x) ≡ {xi, xj} the structure
matrix,

Bx(

∂H
∂xj dxj) = Σi,jJ ij(x)

∂H
∂xj

∂
∂xi |x ;

(cf. eq. 5.41). So in local coordinates, Hamilton’s equations are given by eq. 5.22,
which was:

So the condition for a momentum map XJ(ξ) = ξM is that for all ξ ∈ g and all x ∈ M

In coordinates, this is the requirement that for all i = 1, . . . , m

dxi
dt

= Σm

j J ij(x)

∂H
∂xj .

Bx(d(J(ξ))(x)) = ξM (x) .

Σm

j J ij(x)

∂J(ξ)
∂xj = (ξM )i(x) ,

where—apologies!—the two Js on the left hand side have very diﬀerent meanings.

In the symplectic case, dim(M) ≡ m = 2n and we have Hamilton’s equations as

eq. 2.15, viz.

So the condition for a momentum map is that for all ξ

iXH ω := ω(XH, ·) = dH(·) .

ω(ξM , ·) = d(J(ξ))(·) .

In Hamiltonian mechanics, it is common to write the 2n local coordinates q, p as ξ, i.e.
to write

ξα := qα, α = 1, ..., n ;

ξα := pα−n, α = n + 1, ..., 2n .

(6.23)

So in order to express eq. 6.22 in local coordinates, let us temporarily write η for the
arbitrary element of g. Then writing ηM = (ηM )α ∂
∂ξβ ), eq. 6.22
becomes

∂ξα and ωαβ := ω( ∂

∂ξα , ∂

ωαβ(ηM )α =

∂J(η)
∂ξβ

.

(3): Components: an example:— As discussed after eq. 6.3, we think of the collec-

tion of functions J(ξ), as ξ varies through g, as the components of J.

To take our standard example: the angular momentum of a particle in Euclidean
space, in a state x = (q, p) is J(x) := q∧p. Identifying so(3)∗ with IR3 so that the nat-
ural pairing is given by the dot product (cf. (3) at the end of Section 4.5.2), we get that
the component of J(x) around the axis ξ ∈ IR3 is < J(x) ; ξ >= ξ ·(q∧p). The Hamil-
tonian vector ﬁeld determined by this Hamiltonian function x = (q, p) 7→ ξ · (q ∧ p) is
of course the inﬁnitesimal generator of rotations about the ξ-axis. In Section 6.3, we
will see more examples of momentum maps.

6.2 Conservation of momentum maps: Noether’s theorem

In ordinary Hamiltonian mechanics, we saw that Noether’s theorem had a simple ex-
pression as a “one-liner” based on the antisymmetry of the Poisson bracket: namely,
in eq. 2.19, which was that for any scalar functions F, H

XF (H) = {H, F } = 0

iﬀ

0 = {F, H} = XH(F ) .

(6.25)

In words: the Hamiltonian H is constant under the ﬂow induced by F iﬀ F is a con-
stant of the motion under the dynamical ﬂow XH.

More precisely, Section 2.1.3 vindicated this one-liner as expressing Noether’s theo-
rem. For the one-liner respected the requirement that a symmetry should preserve the
symplectic form (equivalently, the Poisson bracket), and not just (as in the left hand
side of eq. 6.25) the Hamiltonian function H; for, by Cartan’s magic formula, a vector
ﬁeld’s preserving the symplectic form was equivalent to its being locally Hamiltonian.

For Poisson manifolds, the equivalence corresponding to this last statement fails.
That is, as we noted in (2) of Section 6.1.1: an inﬁnitesimal Poisson automorphism
need not be locally Hamiltonian.

Nevertheless, most of the “one-liner” approach to Noether’s theorem carries over
to the framework of Poisson manifolds. In eﬀect, we just restrict discussion to cases
where the relevant Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds exist: recall our saying after (2) of Section
6.1.1 that we would concentrate on cases where all the ξM are globally Hamiltonian.

Thus, it is straightforward to show that for a Poisson manifold M, just as for
symplectic manifolds: if F, H ∈ F (M), H is constant along the integral curves of XF
iﬀ {H, F } = 0 iﬀ F is constant along the integral curves of XH. (We could have proved
this already in Section 5.2.2; but postponed it till now, when it will be used.)

With this result as a lemma, one immediately gets

Noether’s theorem for Poisson manifolds Suppose that G acts canon-
ically on a Poisson manifold M and has a momentum map J : M → g∗;
and that H is invariant under ξM for all ξ ∈ g, i.e. {H, J(ξ)} = ξM (H) =
0, ∀ξ ∈ g; (cf. eq. 6.6). Then J is a constant of the motion determined by

107

H. That is:

where φτ is the ﬂow of XH.

J ◦ φτ = J

(6.26)

Proof: By the lemma, the fact that {H, J(ξ)} = ξM (H) = 0 implies that J(ξ) is
constant along the ﬂow of XH. So by the deﬁnition of momentum map, eq. 6.13, the
corresponding g∗-valued map J is also a constant of the motion. QED.

It follows immediately that H itself, and any distinguished function, is a constant
of the motion. Besides, as remarked in (2) at the end of Section 6.1.1: a constant
of the motion J(ξ) is determined only up to an arbitrary choice of a distinguished
function.
Indeed, though this Chapter has set aside (ever since (iii) of Section 1.2)
time-dependent functions: if one considers them, then there is here an arbitrary choice
of a time-dependent distinguished function.

6.3 Examples

We give two familiar examples; and then, as a glimpse of the general power of the
theory, two abstract examples (which will not be needed later on).

(1): Total linear momentum of N particles :—

In (3) at the end of Section 4.1.A, we showed that the left cotangent lift of the ac-
tion of the translation group IR3 on Q = IR3N to M = T ∗IR3N , i.e. the left action
corresponding to eq. 4.11, is

Ψx(qi, pi) := T ∗(Φ−x)(qi, pi) = (qi + x, pi) ,

i = 1, ..., N .

(6.27)

(Here we combine the discussions of examples (vi) and (ix) in Section 4.1.A.)

To ﬁnd the momentum map, we: (a) compute the inﬁnitesimal generator ξM for an
arbitrary element ξ of g = IR3; and then (b) solve eq. 6.22, or in coordinates eq. 6.24.

(a): We diﬀerentiate eq. 6.27 with respect to x in the direction ξ, getting

ξM (qi, pi) = (ξ, ..., ξ, 0, ..., 0) .

(b): Any function J(ξ) has Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld

XJ(ξ)(qi, pi) =

∂J(ξ)
∂pi

(cid:18)

, −

∂J(ξ)
∂qi (cid:19)

;

so that the desired J(ξ) with XJ(ξ) = ξM solves

(6.28)

(6.29)

∂J(ξ)
∂pi = ξ and

∂J(ξ)
∂qi

= 0 , 1 ≤ i ≤ N .

(6.30)

Choosing constants so that J is linear, the solution is

J(ξ)(qi, pi) =

ΣN

i=1pi

· ξ ,

i.e. J(qi, pi) = ΣN

i=1pi ;

(6.31)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

108

i.e. the familiar total linear momentum.

(2): Angular momentum of a single particle :—

SO(3) acts on Q = IR3 by ΦA(q) = Aq. So the tangent (derivative) map is

TqΦA : (q, v) ∈ T IR3

q 7→ (Aq, Av) ∈ T IR3

Aq .

(6.32)

As we saw in example (vii) of Section 4.1.A, the left cotangent lift of the action to
M = T ∗IR3 (the lifted action “with g−1”, corresponding to eq. 4.11) is:

T ∗
Aq(ΦA−1)(q, p) = (Aq, Ap) .

(6.33)

To ﬁnd the momentum map, we proceed in two stages, (a) and (b), as in example (1).
(a): We diﬀerentiate eq. 6.33 with respect to A in the direction ξ = Θ(ω) ∈ so(3),

where ω ∈ IR3 and Θ is as in eq. 3.20 and 3.23. We get

ξM (q, p) = (ξq, ξp) = (ω ∧ q, ω ∧ v) .

(6.34)

(b): So the desired J(ξ) is the solution linear in ξ to the Hamilton’s equations

∂J(ξ)
∂p

∂J(ξ)
∂q

= ξq and

= −ξp .

(6.35)

So a solution is given by

so that

J(ξ)(q, p) = (ξq) · p = (ω ∧ q) · p = (q ∧ p) · ω ,

(6.36)

J(q, p) = q ∧ p ,

(6.37)

i.e. the familiar angular momentum.

(3): Dual of a Lie algebra homomorphism :—

We begin by stating a Lemma, which we will not prove; for details cf. Marsden and
let G, H be Lie groups and let α : g → h be
Ratiu (1999: 10.7.2, p. 372). Namely:
a linear map between their Lie algebras. Then α is a Lie algebra homomorphism iﬀ
its dual α∗ : h∗ → g∗ is a (linear) Poisson map (where h∗, g∗ are equipped with their
natural Lie-Poisson brackets as in Section 5.2.4).

Now let G, H be Lie groups, let A : H → G be a Lie group homomorphism, and
let α : h → g be the induced Lie algebra homomorphism; so that by the Lemma,
α∗ : g∗ → h∗ is a Poisson map. We will prove that α∗ is also a momentum map for the
action of H on g∗ given by, with h ∈ H, x ∈ g∗:

Φ(h, x) ≡ h · x := Ad∗

A(h)−1x .

(6.38)

Proof: We ﬁrst recall the adjoint and co-adjoint actions Adg : g → g and Ad∗

g :

g∗ → g∗; in particular, eq. 4.76. So the action in eq. 6.38 is:

∀x ∈ g∗, ∀ξ ∈ g : < h · x; ξ > = < x; AdA(h)−1ξ > .

(6.39)

109

As usual, we compute for η ∈ h, the inﬁnitesimal generator ηg∗ at x ∈ g∗ by diﬀer-
entiating eq. 6.39 with respect to h at e in the direction η ∈ h. We get (cf. eq.
4.83):

< ηg∗(x); ξ > = − < x; adα(η)ξ > = < ad∗

α(η)(x); ξ > .

(6.40)

We deﬁne J(x) := α∗(x): that is,

J(η)(x) ≡ < J(x); η > := < α∗(x); η > ≡ < x; α(η) > ;

(6.41)

which implies

∇xJ(η) = α(η) .
Now we recall that Hamilton’s equations for J(η) as the Hamiltonian are (cf. eq. 5.30)

(6.42)

Combining eq. 6.40 to eq. 6.43, we get:

˙x ≡ XJ(η)(x) = ad∗

∇xJ(η)(x) .

XJ(η)(x) = ad∗

α(η)(x) = ηg∗(x) ;

(6.43)

(6.44)

proving that J(x) := α∗(x) is a momentum map. QED.

(4): Momentum maps for subgroups :—

Assume that J : M → g∗ is a momentum map for a canonical left action of G on M;
and let H < G be a subgroup of G. Then H also acts canonically on M, and this
action has as a momentum map the restriction of J’s values to h ⊂ g. That is: the
map

JH : M → h∗ given by JH(x) := J(x) |h .
(6.45)
For the canonical action of G ensures that if η ∈ h ⊂ g, then ηM = XJ(η). Then
JH(η) := J(η)∀η ∈ h deﬁnes a momentum map for H’s action. That is

∀x ∈ M, ∀η ∈ h : < JH(x); η > = < J(x); η > .

(6.46)

6.4 Equivariance of momentum maps

In (1) of Section 4.2, we deﬁned the general notion of an equivariant map f : M → N
between manifolds as one that respects the actions of a group G on M and on N: eq.
4.29. We now develop an especially important case of this notion: the equivariance of
momentum maps J : M → g∗, where the action on g∗ is the co-adjoint action, eq. 4.77.

For us, this notion will have two main signiﬁcances:—
(i): many momentum maps that occur in examples are equivariant in this sense;
(ii): equivariance has various theoretical consequences:

in particular, momentum
maps for cotangent lifted actions are always equivariant (Section 6.5), and equivariance
is crucial in theorems about reduction (Section 7).

In this Section, we will glimpse these points by:
(i): deﬁning the notion, and remarking on a weakened diﬀerential version of the

notion (Section 6.4.1);

(ii): proving that equivariant momentum maps are Poisson (Section 6.4.2).

110

6.4.1 Equivariance and inﬁnitesimal equivariance

Let Φ be a canonical left action of G on M, and let J : M → g∗ be a momentum map
for it. We say J is equivariant if for all g ∈ G

cf. eq. 4.29 and the deﬁnition of co-adjoint action, eq. 4.78:

J ◦ Φg = Ad∗

g−1 ◦ J ;

An equivalent formulation arises by considering that we can add to the commutative

square in eq. 6.48 the two commutative triangles:

(6.47)

(6.48)

(6.49)

(6.50)

< Ad∗

g−1(η); Adg(ξ) > = < η; Adg−1Adg(ξ) > ≡ < η; ξ > .

(6.51)

Eq.s 6.49 and 6.50 imply that an equivalent formulation of equivariance is that for all
x ∈ M, g ∈ G and ξ ∈ g (and with g · x ≡ Φg(x))

J(g · x)(Adgξ) ≡ J(Adgξ)(g · x) = J(ξ)(x) ≡ J(x)(ξ) .

(6.52)

In (2) of Section 4.4, we diﬀerentiated the general notion of an equivariant map,
and got the weaker diﬀerential notion that the inﬁnitesimal generators ξM and ξN of
the actions of G on M and on N are f -related.

Here also we can diﬀerentiate equivariance, and get the notion of inﬁnitesimal

equivariance. But I will not go into details since:

(i): we will not need the notion, not least because (as mentioned above), many

momentum maps are equivariant;

(i): under certain common conditions (e.g. the group G is compact, or is connected)
an inﬁnitesimally equivariant momentum map can always be replaced by an equivariant
one.

So let it suﬃce to say that inﬁnitesimal equivariance is theoretically important. In

particular, the result eq. 6.7, viz.

XJ([ξ,η]) = X{J(ξ),J(η)}M

(6.53)

111

implies that

Σ(ξ, η) := J([ξ, η]) − {J(ξ), J(η)}M

(6.54)

is a distinguished function on the Poisson manifold M, and so constant on every sym-
plectic leaf.

This makes it natural to ask when Σ ≡ 0. After all, cf. eq. 6.12. Both ξ 7→ ξM and
F 7→ XF are Lie algebra anti-homomorphisms. So it is natural to ask whether J is a
Lie algebra homomorphism, i.e. whether Σ = 0. And it turns out that inﬁnitesimal
equivariance is equivalent to Σ = 0.

6.4.2 Equivariant momentum maps are Poisson

The following result is important, both as a general method of ﬁnding canonical maps
between Poisson manifolds, and for the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem of Section 7.

Equivariant momentum maps are Poisson Let J : M → g∗ be an
equivariant momentum map for a canonical left action of G on a Poisson
manifold M. Then J is a Poisson map: for all F1, F2 ∈ F (g∗),

J∗{F1, F2}g∗ = {J∗F1, J∗F2}M ; i.e. {F1, F2}g∗ ◦ J = {F1 ◦ J, F2 ◦ J}M .
(6.55)

Proof:— We will relate (i) the left hand side, then (ii) the right hand side of eq.
6.55 to J; and ﬁnally we will use the fact that the Poisson bracket on M depends only
on the values of the ﬁrst derivatives.

(i): Let x ∈ M, α = J(x) ∈ g∗; and let ξ = ∇F1 and η = ∇F2 evaluated at α, so

that ξ, η ∈ g∗∗ = g. Then

{F1, F2}g∗(J(x)) ≡< α; [∇F1, ∇F2] >=< α; [ξ, η] >= J([ξ, η])(x) = {J(ξ), J(η)}(x) ;

(6.56)
where the third equation just applies the deﬁnition of J, eq. 6.13, and the fourth
equation uses (inﬁnitesimal) equivariance.

(ii): We show that (F1 ◦ J)(x) and J(ξ)(x) have equal x-derivatives. For any x ∈ M

and vx ∈ TxM

d(F1 ◦ J)(x) · vx = dF1(α) · TxJ(vx) =< TxJ(vx); ∇F1 >= dJ(ξ)(x) · vx ;

(6.57)

where the ﬁrst equation uses the chain rule, and the last uses the deﬁnition of J, eq.
6.13 and the fact that ξ = ∇F1.

Finally, since the Poisson bracket on M depends only on the values of the ﬁrst

derivatives, we infer from eq. 6.57 that

{F1 ◦ J, F2 ◦ J}(x) = {J(ξ), J(η)}(x) .

(6.58)

Combining this with (i), the result follows. QED.

112

6.5 Momentum maps on cotangent bundles

Let a Lie group G act on a manifold (“conﬁguration space”) Q. We saw in Section
4.1.A that this action can be lifted to the cotangent bundle T ∗Q; cf. eq.s 4.6, 4.9 and
4.11. In this Section, we focus on momentum maps for such cotangent lift actions. We
shall see that any such action has an equivariant momentum map, for which there is
an explicit general formula. The general theory (Sections 6.5.1, 6.5.2) will need just
one main new notion, the momentum function. We end with some examples (Section
6.5.3).

6.5.1 Momentum functions

Given a manifold Q and its vector ﬁelds X (Q), we deﬁne the map

P : X (Q) → F (T ∗Q) by :

(P(X))(αq) := < αq; X(q) >

(6.59)

for q ∈ Q, X ∈ X (Q) and αq ∈ T ∗
q Q. Here, αq is, strictly speaking, a point in the
cotangent bundle above the base-point q ∈ Q: so αq can be written as (q, α) with α a
covector at q, i.e. α ∈ T ∗
q Q. But as we mentioned just before deﬁning cotangent lifts
(eq. 4.6): it is harmless to (follow many presentations and) conﬂate a point in T ∗Q,
i.e. a pair (q, α), q ∈ Q, α ∈ T ∗
q Q, with its form α, provided we keep track of the q by
writing the form as αq.

P(X), as deﬁned by eq. 6.59, is called the momentum function of X. In coordinates,

P(X) is given by

P(X)(qi, pi) = X j(qi)pj

(6.60)

where we sum on j = 1, ..., n := dim Q. (So NB: This P is diﬀerent from that in
P(M), the inﬁnitesimal Poisson automorphisms of M, discussed in Section 6.1.1.)

We also denote by L(T ∗Q) the space of smooth functions F : T ∗Q → IR that are
q Q as (q, α) and (q, β),

linear on ﬁbres of T ∗Q: i.e. writing the bundle points αq, βq ∈ T ∗
we have for λ, µ ∈ IR

F (q, (λα + µβ)) = λF ((q, α)) + µF ((q, β)) .

(6.61)

So functions F, H that are in L(T ∗Q) can be written in coordinates as (summing on
i = 1, ..., n)

F (q, p) = X i(q)pi and H(q, p) = Y i(q)pi

(6.62)

for functions X i and Y i; and so any momentum function P(X) is in L(T ∗Q).

One readily checks that the standard Poisson bracket (from T ∗Q’s symplectic struc-
ture, Section 2.1.1) of such an F and H is also linear on the ﬁbres of T ∗Q. In fact, eq.
6.62 implies

{F, H}(q, p) :=

∂F
∂qj

∂H
∂pj

−

∂H
∂qj

∂F
∂pj

=

∂X i
∂qj Y j −

∂Y i
∂qj X j

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

.

(6.63)

113

So L(T ∗Q) is a Lie subalgebra of F (T ∗Q).

The next result summarizes how momentum functions relate X (Q) and Hamiltonian

vector ﬁelds on T ∗Q to L(T ∗Q).

Three (anti)-isomorphic Lie algebras The two Lie algebras
(i) (X (Q), [, ]) of vector ﬁelds on Q;
(ii) Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds XF on T ∗Q with F ∈ L(T ∗Q)
are isomorphic. And each is anti-isomorphic to
(iii) (L(T ∗Q), {, }).
In particular, the map P is an anti-isomorphism from (i) to (iii), so that
we have

{P(X), P(Y )}T ∗Q = −P([X, Y ]) .

(6.64)

Proof: Since P(X) : T ∗Q → IR is linear on ﬁbres, P maps X (Q) into L(T ∗Q). P is
also onto L(T ∗Q): given F ∈ L(T ∗Q), we can deﬁne X(F ) ∈ X (Q) by

< αq; X(F )(q) > := F (αq) ∀αq ∈ T ∗

q Q

(6.65)

so that P(X(F )) = F . P is linear and P(X) = 0 implies that X = 0. Also, eq. 6.64
follows immediately by comparing eq. 6.63 with the Lie bracket of X, Y ∈ X (Q); cf.
eq. 3.27. So P is an anti-isomorphism from (X Q, [, ]) to (L(T ∗Q), {, }).

The map

F ∈ (L(T ∗Q), {, }) 7→ XF ∈ ({XF | F ∈ L(T ∗Q)}, [, ])

(6.66)

is surjective by deﬁnition. It is a Lie algebra anti-homomorphism, by eq. 3.32 (i.e.
result (2) in Section 3.2.2). And if XF = 0, then F is constant on T ∗Q; and hence
F ≡ 0 since F is linear on the ﬁbres (cf. eq. 6.61). QED.

6.5.2 Momentum maps for cotangent lifted actions

We begin this Subsection with a result relating the Hamiltonian ﬂow on T ∗Q induced
by the momentum function P(X) to the Hamiltonian ﬂow on X induced by X. From
this result, our main result—the guarantee of an equivariant momentum map for a
cotangent lifted action, and an explicit formula for it—will follow directly.

The Hamiltonian ﬂow of a momentum function Let X ∈ X (Q) have
ﬂow φτ on Q; cf. Section 3.1.2.B. Then the ﬂow of XP(X) on T ∗Q is T ∗φ−τ .
That is: the ﬂow of XP(X) is the cotangent lift (Section 4.1.A) of φ−τ , as
given by the diagram, with πQ the canonical projection:

φτ−→

T ∗φ−τ−→

Q



Proof: We diﬀerentiate the relation in eq. 6.67, i.e.

πQ ◦ T ∗φ−τ = φτ ◦ πQ

(6.68)

at τ = 0 to get

T πQ ◦ Y = X ◦ πQ with ∀αq ∈ T ∗

q Q, Y (αq) =

|τ =0 T ∗φ−τ (αq) ;

(6.69)

d
dτ

i.e. T ∗φ−τ is the ﬂow of Y .

Now we will show that Y = XP(X), using eq. 6.69 and the geometrical formulation
of Hamiltonian mechanics of Section 2.1, especially Cartan’s magic formula, eq. 2.20,
applied to the canonical one-form θ ≡ θH (deﬁned by eq. 2.8 and 2.9).

We reported (at the start of (2) of Section 4.1.A) that the cotangent lift T ∗φ−τ
preserves θ ≡ θH on T ∗Q. So LY θ = 0. Then the deﬁnition of ω as the negative
exterior derivative of θ, and Cartan’s magic formula, eq. 2.20, yields

iY ω = −iY dθ = diY θ .

(6.70)

On the other hand, we also have

iY θ(αq) ≡< θ(αq); Y (αq) >=< αq; T πQ(Y (αq)) >=< αq; X(q) >= P(X)(αq)

(6.71)

where the second equation applies the deﬁnition of the canonical one-form (eq. 2.8),
the third applies eq. 6.69, and the fourth applies the deﬁnition eq. 6.59 of momentum
functions.

Combining eq. 6.70 and 6.71, we have:

iY ω = dP(X)

(6.72)

which is Hamilton’s equations (eq. 2.15) telling us that Y = XP(X). QED.

Accordingly the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XP(X) on T ∗Q is called the cotangent lift

of X ∈ Q to T ∗Q. In local coordinates, we can write, by combining eq. ?? and 6.60

XP(X) =

∂P(X)
∂pi

∂
∂qi −

∂P(X)
∂qi

∂
∂pi

= X i ∂

∂qi −

∂X i
∂qj pi

∂
∂pj

.

(6.73)

Note in particular that, combining the usual sign-change between Lie algebras and
Poisson brackets (eq. 3.32) with the sign-change for momentum functions (eq. 6.64),
we have

[XP(X), XP(Y )] = −X{P(X),P(Y )} = −X−P([X,Y ]) = XP([X,Y ]) .

(6.74)

We can now readily prove our main result guaranteeing, and giving a formula for,

equivariant momentum maps.

115

Equivariant momentum maps Let G act on the left on Q and so by
cotangent lift on T ∗Q. The cotangent lifted action has an equivariant mo-
mentum map J : T ∗Q → g∗ given by

< J(αq); ξ > = < αq; ξQ(q) > ≡ P(ξQ)(αq) .

(6.75)

In coordinates qi, pi on T ∗Q and ξa on g, and with ξi
nents of ξQ, this reads

Q = ξaAi

a the compo-

Jaξa = piξi

Q = piAi

aξa

(6.76)

so that Ja(q, p) = piAi

a(q).

Proof: The preceding result tells us that for any ξ ∈ g, the inﬁnitesimal generator of
the cotangent lifted action on T ∗Q is ξT ∗Q ≡ XP(ξQ). So a momentum map for this
action is given by

J(ξ) = P(ξQ) .

This gives eq. 6.75, just by applying the deﬁnitions of the momentum map J (eq. 6.13)
and of momentum function (eq. 6.59).

To prove equivariance, we argue as follows:

< J(g · αq); ξ > = < (g · αq); ξQ(g · q) >
= < αq; (T Φg−1)ξQ(g · q) > ≡ < αq; (Tg·qΦg−1 ◦ ξQ ◦ Φg)(q).
gξQ)(q) >
= < αq; (Adg−1ξ)Q(q) >
g−1(J(αq)); ξ > .

= < J(αq); Adg−1ξ > = < Ad∗

= < αq; (Φ∗

Here we have applied in succession: (i) eq. 6.75; (ii) the fact that g · αq is short for
T ∗(Φg−1)(αq), cf. eq. 4.11 and 4.6; (iii) the deﬁnition of pullback, cf. eq. 4.57; (iv)
result [2], eq. 4.52, of Section 4.5.1; (v) eq. 6.75 again; and ﬁnally, (vi) the fact that
Ad∗ is the adjoint of Ad, cf. eq. 4.76. QED.

6.5.3 Examples

We discuss ﬁrst our familiar examples, linear and angular momentum i.e. (1) and (2)
from Section 6.3; and then the cotangent lift of left and right translations on G—an
example motivated by Section 4.6’s description of kinematics on a Lie group G.

(1): Total linear momentum of N particles:—

Since the translation group IR3 acts on Q := IR3N by Φ(x, (qi)) = (qi + x), the
inﬁnitesimal generator on Q is

ξIR3N (qi) = (ξ, . . . , ξ)(ξ N times)

(6.83)

(6.77)

(6.78)
(6.79)
(6.80)
(6.81)
(6.82)

116

Applying eq. 6.75, the equivariant momentum map is given by

J(ξ)(qi, pi) =

ΣN

i=1pi

· ξ ,

i.e. J(qi, pi) = ΣN

i=1pi ;

(6.84)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

agreeing with our previous solution, eq. 6.31, based on the diﬀerential equation eq.
6.24.

(2): Angular momentum of a single particle:—

SO(3) acts on IR3 by Φ(A, q) = Aq. Writing ξ ∈ so(3) as ξ = Θω (cf. eq. 3.19, 3.23
and 3.77), the inﬁnitesimal generator is

ξIR3(q) = ξq = ω ∧ q .

(6.85)

So applying eq. 6.75, the equivariant momentum map J : T ∗IR3 → so(3) ∼= IR3 is given
by

< J(q, p); ω >=< p; ω ∧q >= p·(ω ∧q) = ω ·(q∧p) ,

i.e. J(q, p) = q∧p ; (6.86)

agreeing with our previous solution, eq. 6.37, based on the diﬀerential equation eq.
6.24.

(3): The cotangent lift of left and right translations on G:—

Recalling eq. 4.42, viz. that the inﬁnitesimal generator of left translation is

ξG(g) = (TeRg)ξ ,

(6.87)

a right-invariant vector ﬁeld, and applying eq. 6.75, we see that the momentum map
JL : T ∗G → g∗ for the cotangent lift of left translation is given by

< JL(αg); ξ > = < αg; ξG(g) > = < αg; (TeRg)ξ > = < (T ∗

e Rg)(αg); ξ >

(6.88)

where the last equation applies the deﬁnition of the cotangent lift eq. 4.6. That is: the
equivariant momentum map is

JL(αg) = T ∗

e Rg(αg) .

(6.89)

In words: the momentum map JL of the cotangent lift of left translation is the cotangent
lift of right translation.

In a similar way, we could consider right translation: Rg : h 7→ hg. Right translation
deﬁnes a right action on G, has ξG(g) = (TeLg)ξ as its inﬁnitesimal generator, and so
has

JR : T ∗G → g∗ ; JR(αg) := T ∗

e Lg(αg)

(6.90)

as the momentum map of its cotangent lift. Note that this momentum map is equiv-
ariant with respect to Ad∗

g: which, as discussed after eq. 4.76, is a right action.

7 Reduction

7.1 Preamble

In this ﬁnal Section, the themes of Section 2 onwards come together—at last! As
announced in Section 5.1, we will concentrate on proving what is nowadays called the
Lie-Poisson reduction theorem: that is, the isomorphism of Poisson manifolds

T ∗G/G ∼= g∗ .

(7.1)

Here the quotient of T ∗G is by the cotangent lift of G’s action on itself by left trans-
lation.

As it happens, this Chapter’s main sources (i.e. Abraham and Marsden (1978),
Arnold (1989), Olver (2000) and Marsden and Ratiu (1999)) do not contain what is
surely the most direct proof of this result. So we give it in Section 7.2. The result
will follow directly from four previous main results, one from Section 5 and three from
Section 6.

‘Directly’, but for one wrinkle! This relates to “ﬂipping” between left and right
translation, and their various lifts. In short: the four previous results show that T ∗G/G
is isomorphic as a Poisson manifold, not to g∗ with the Lie-Poisson bracket familiar
since eq. 5.24 and 5.27, but instead to g∗ equipped with this bracket’s negative, i.e.
equipped with

{F, H}−(x) := − < x; [∇F (x), ∇H(x)] > , x ∈ g∗ .

(7.2)

But we shall (mercifully!) not reproduce, with minus signs appropriately added, our
entire discussion of the Lie-Poisson bracket that ensued after eq. 5.24; (exercise for the
reader!).

To avoid ambiguity, we shall sometimes write g∗

+ for g∗ equipped with the positive
− for g∗ equipped with the negative Lie-Poisson

Lie-Poisson bracket of eq. 5.27; and g∗
bracket of eq. 7.2.

In fact, it will be clearest from now on, to treat right actions on a par with left
actions; despite our previous emphasis on the latter. This will mean that we will also
treat right-invariant vector ﬁelds (and another notion of right-invariance deﬁned in
Section 7.3.1) on a par with left-invariant vector ﬁelds (and Section 7.3.1’s correspond-
ing new notion of left-invariance).
Indeed, we have already glimpsed this would be
necessary in:

(i): Section 4.4’s result that the inﬁnitesimal generator of left translation is a right-
invariant vector ﬁeld, and vice versa (eq. 4.42, 4.43); and its corollaries in Example
(3) of Section 6.5.3, that

(ii): the momentum map JL of the cotangent lift of left translation is the cotangent

lift of right translation; (eq. 6.89); and

gent lift of left translation; (eq. 6.90).

(iii): the momentum map JR of the cotangent lift of right translation is the cotan-

118

So by the end of Section 7.2, we will have a short proof of the Lie-Poisson reduction
theorem. But (as often happens), the most direct proof does not give very much
information about the situation. So in Section 7.3 we give more information (following
Marsden and Ratiu (1999)). Then in Section 7.4, we discuss the reduction of dynamics
(as against Poisson structure) from T ∗G to g∗.

Finally, in Section 7.5 we state another reduction theorem, which is cast in terms of
symplectic, not Poisson, manifolds—but which uses several notions from Section 3, such
as free and proper actions, and isotropy groups. But we do not prove this theorem: we
include it mostly in order to emphasize our previous remark, that (despite its length!)
this Chapter just scratches the surface of the subject. We also discuss the relation
between it and the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem.

7.2 The Lie-Poisson Reduction Theorem

First we recall from the end of Section 4.6.2 (eq. 4.112) that ¯λ : T ∗G → G × g∗ is an
equivariant map relating the cotangent lifted left action of left translation on T ∗G to
the G-action on G × g∗ given just by left translation on the ﬁrst component. So we
passed to the quotients, and deﬁned ˆ¯λ : T ∗G/G → (G × g∗)/G by eq. 4.116, viz.

Orb(¯λ(α)) ≡ {(hg, (T ∗

e Lg)(α)) | some h ∈ G} ≡ {(h, (T ∗

ˆ¯λ : Orb(α) ≡ {β ∈ T ∗G | β = T ∗Lh−1(α), some h ∈ G} 7→

(7.3)
e Lg)α) | some h ∈ G} . (7.4)

where α ∈ T ∗
so that the diﬀeomorphism ˆ¯λ maps T ∗G/G to g∗, as in eq. 4.117:

g G, so that T ∗Lh−1α ∈ T ∗

hgG. Finally, we identiﬁed (G × g∗)/G with g∗,

ˆ¯λ : Orb(α) ≡ {β ∈ T ∗G | β = T ∗Lh−1(α), some h ∈ G} ∈ T ∗G/G 7→ (T ∗

e Lg)(α) ∈ g∗.
(7.5)
So now, we are to show that the diﬀeomorphism ˆ¯λ : T ∗G/G → g∗ is a Poisson map,

in the sense of eq. 5.52 (Section 5.3.2). So we need to show:

(i): T ∗G/G is a Poisson manifold;
(ii): ˆ¯λ maps (i)’s Poisson structure on T ∗G/G to that of g∗. In fact, as announced

in Section 7.1, ˆ¯λ maps on to the Poisson structure of g∗

−, i.e. as given by eq. 7.2.

Prima facie, there could be a judicious choice to be made about (i), i.e. about how
to deﬁne the Poisson structure on T ∗G/G, so as to secure (ii), i.e. so that ˆ¯λ respects
the Poisson structure. But in fact our previous work gives a pre-eminently obvious
choice—which works. Namely: we use the Poisson structure induced on T ∗G/G by
the Poisson reduction theorem of Section 5.5. The result follows directly by combining
with this theorem, three results from Section 6:

(i): that equivariant momentum maps are Poisson; eq. 6.55 in Section 6.4.2;
(ii): that a cotangent lifted left action has an equivariant momentum map; eq. 6.75

in Section 6.5.2;

119

(iii): that the momentum maps of the cotangent lifts of left and right translation

on G are JL = T ∗

e Rg and JR = T ∗

e Lg; eq. 6.89 and 6.90 in Section 6.5.3.

In particular, combining (i)-(iii): one deduces (exercise!) that JR = T ∗

ariant with respect to Ad∗
bracket (eq. 7.2’s bracket) on g∗. That is: it is Poisson with the codomain g∗
−.

e Lg is equiv-
g, and so Poisson with respect to the negative Lie-Poisson

Thus we have the

Lie-Poisson reduction theorem The diﬀeomorphism ˆ¯λ : T ∗G/G → g∗:
ˆ¯λ : Orb(α) ≡ {β ∈ T ∗G | β = T ∗Lh−1(α), some h ∈ G} ∈ T ∗G/G 7→ (T ∗

e Lg)(α) ∈ g∗
(7.6)

is Poisson.

Proof: First, eq. 7.6 means we have a commutative triangle. For with π : T ∗G →
T ∗G/G the canonical projection, the momentum map JR : T ∗G → g∗, αg 7→ (T ∗
e Lg)αg
is equal to ˆ¯λ ◦ π:

T ∗G π−→ T ∗G/G

ˆ¯λ−→ g∗ .

(7.7)

Since left translation is a diﬀeomorphism of G, and the cotangent lift of any diﬀeomor-
phism of a manifold to its cotangent bundle is symplectic (cf. after eq. 4.5 in Section
4.1.A), the Poisson reduction theorem of Section 5.5 applies. That is, there is a unique
Poisson structure on T ∗G/G such that π is Poisson. We also know from eq. 6.75, 6.55
and 6.90 that JR = T ∗

e Lg is Poisson with respect to eq. 7.2’s bracket on g∗.
i.e.

We can now deduce that ˆ¯λ is Poisson,

that for all x ∈ T ∗G/G and all

F, H ∈ F (g∗

−)

({F, H}g∗

− ◦ ˆ¯λ) (x) = {F ◦ ˆ¯λ, H ◦ ˆ¯λ}T ∗G/G (x) .

(7.8)

We just use (in order) the facts that:

(i): π is surjective, so that for all x ∈ T ∗G/G there is an αg ∈ T ∗G with x =

π(αg) ≡ Orb(αg);

(ii): JR = ˆ¯λ ◦ π;
(iii): JR is Poisson; and
(iv): π is Poisson:

− ◦ (ˆ¯λ ◦ π) (αg)
− ◦ JR (αg) = {F ◦ JR, H ◦ JR}T ∗G (αg)
= {F ◦ ˆ¯λ, H ◦ ˆ¯λ}T ∗G/G (π(αg)) ≡ {F ◦ ˆ¯λ, H ◦ ˆ¯λ}T ∗G/G (x) . QED.

− ◦ ˆ¯λ) (x) = {F, H}g∗

= {F, H}g∗

(7.11)

7.3 Meshing with the symplectic structure on T ∗G: invariant

functions

We turn to giving more information about the situation described by the Lie-Poisson
reduction theorem. The general idea will be that the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗ meshes

120

with the canonical symplectic structure on T ∗G. This will be made precise in two
ways: the ﬁrst is discussed in the ﬁrst two Subsections, the second is discussed in the
third Subsection.

The ﬁrst discussion will have three stages:
(i): we show that scalars on g∗, F ∈ F (g∗), are in one-one correspondence with
scalars on T ∗G that are constant on the orbits of the cotangent lift of left translation,
which will be called left-invariant functions; and similarly, for the cotangent lift of right
translation (a correspondence with right-invariant functions);

(ii): we take the usual canonical Poisson bracket in T ∗G of these left-invariant or
right-invariant scalars; and restrict this bracket to g∗ regarded as the cotangent space
T ∗
e G at the identity e ∈ G; and then

(iii): we show that this restriction is the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗: the familiar
positive one for right-invariant functions, and the new negative one of eq. 7.2 for the
left-invariant functions.

We do stages (i) and (ii) in Section 7.3.1. These stages will not involve the choice
between the positive and negative Lie-Poisson brackets. But stage (iii), in Section
7.3.2, will involve this choice. It will be a one-liner corollary of Section 6.4.2’s result
that equivariant momentum maps are Poisson maps, eq. 6.55; (unsurprisingly, in that
we also used this result in Section 7.2’s proof of the reduction theorem).

In the third Subsection, we use invariant functions to show a diﬀerent sense in which
the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗ meshes with the symplectic structure on T ∗G. Namely,
we derive the Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗ from the Poisson reduction theorem of Section
5.5, by using the ideas of invariant functions and momentum functions.

7.3.1 Left-invariant and right-invariant functions on T ∗G

We say that a function F : T ∗G → IR is left-invariant if for all g ∈ G, and all αg ∈ T ∗

g G

where T ∗Lg is the cotangent lift of Lg : G → G. Similarly, F : T ∗G → IR is called
right-invariant if for all g ∈ G

(F ◦ T ∗Lg)(αg) = F (αg)

(F ◦ T ∗Rg) = F .

(7.12)

(7.13)

So if F : T ∗G → IR is left-invariant or right-invariant, it is determined by its values for
arguments in T ∗

e G = g∗.

Since any α ∈ g∗ is mapped by T ∗Lg−1 ≡ (T ∗Lg)−1 to an element of T ∗

g G, a func-
tion is left-invariant iﬀ it is constant on the orbits of the various T ∗Lg for g ∈ G,
i.e. constant on the orbits of the cotangent lift of left translation. Similarly, a function
is right-invariant iﬀ it is constant on the orbits of the cotangent lift of right translation.

So left-invariant functions induce well-deﬁned functions on the quotient space T ∗G/G;

and so, by Section 7.2, on its diﬀeomorphic (indeed Poisson manifold) copy g∗. Simi-
larly for right-invariant functions.

121

But let us for the moment consider the smooth left-invariant (or right-invariant)
functions on T ∗G, rather than the induced maps on the quotient space. We will denote
the space of all smooth left-invariant functions on T ∗G by FL(T ∗G), and similarly the
space of smooth right-invariant functions by FR(T ∗G).

Recalling (from the discussion after eq. 4.5) that cotangent lifts are symplectic
maps, i.e. T ∗Lg and T ∗Rg are symplectic maps on T ∗G, it follows immmediately that
FL(T ∗G) and FR(T ∗G) are each closed under the canonical Poisson bracket on T ∗G.
So they are each a Lie algebra with this bracket.

Now we can use the momentum maps JL and JR of Example (3) of Section 6.5.3
to extend any scalar F : g∗ → IR, i.e. F ∈ F (g∗), to a left-invariant, or right-invariant,
scalar on T ∗G.

Thus, given F : g∗ → IR and αg ∈ T ∗

g G, we deﬁne FL ∈ FL(T ∗G) by

FL(αg) := (F ◦ JR)(αg) ≡ (F ◦ T ∗

e Lg)(αg) .

(7.14)

So FL is by construction left-invariant, and is called the left-invariant extension of F
from g∗ to T ∗G.

One similarly deﬁnes the right-invariant extension FR ∈ FR(T ∗G) of any F ∈ F (g∗)

FR(αg) := (F ◦ JL)(αg) ≡ (F ◦ T ∗

e Rg)(αg) .

(7.15)

by

Then the maps

F ∈ F (g∗) 7→ FL ∈ FL(T ∗G) and F ∈ F (g∗) 7→ FR ∈ FR(T ∗G)

(7.16)

are vector space isomorphisms (exercise for the reader!) whose inverse is just restriction
to the ﬁber T ∗

e G = g∗.

This completes what we called ‘stages (i) and (ii)’: describing a correspondence
between scalars on g∗ and scalars on T ∗G that are constant on the orbits of the cotan-
gent lifts of left and right translation; and considering the canonical Poisson bracket
(on T ∗G) of these scalars, i.e. the Lie algebras FL(T ∗G) and FR(T ∗G).

7.3.2 Recovering the Lie-Poisson bracket

We now do stage (iii): we show that the restriction of the canonical Poisson bracket on
T ∗G of the right/left invariant functions, to g∗ regarded as the cotangent space T ∗
e G
at the identity e ∈ G, is the positive/negative Lie-Poisson bracket.

Since the inverses of the maps eq. 7.16 are just restriction to the ﬁber T ∗

e G = g∗, it
suﬃces to show that the maps eq. 7.16 are Lie algebra isomorphisms. More precisely:

Recovery of the Lie-Poisson bracket Using the positive Lie-Poisson
bracket on g∗ (we write g∗
+): F 7→ FR is a Lie algebra isomorphism.
Similarly: using the negative Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗ (we write g∗
F 7→ FL is a Lie algebra isomorphism.

−):

122

That is: for all F, H ∈ F (g∗)

{F, H}+ = {FR, HR}T ∗G |g∗ ; {F, H}− = {FL, HL}T ∗G |g∗

(7.17)

Proof: Consider JL : T ∗G → g∗ ≡ g∗

+, JL = T ∗

e Rg. JL is an equivariant momentum

map. So, by the result eq. 6.55 of Section 6.4.2, it is Poisson. That is:

{F, H}+ ◦ JL = {F ◦ JL, H ◦ JL}T ∗G = {FR, HR}T ∗G .

(7.18)

Restricting eq. 7.18 to g∗ gives the ﬁrst equation of eq. 7.17.

Similarly, one proves the second equation by using the fact that JR : T ∗G → g∗ ≡
e Lg is an equivariant momentum map and so is Poisson. That is:

−, JR = T ∗
g∗

{F, H}− ◦ JR = {F ◦ JR, H ◦ JR}T ∗G = {FL, HL}T ∗G .

(7.19)

We then restrict eq. 7.19 to g∗. QED.

7.3.3 Deriving the Lie-Poisson bracket

Our discussion so far, in both Section 7.2 and the two previous Subsections, has taken
the Lie-Poisson bracket (whether positive or negative) as given. We now show, using
invariant functions and Section 6.5.1’s idea of momentum functions, how to derive the
Lie-Poisson bracket on g∗.

So this derivation will amount to another, more “constructive”, proof of the Lie-

Poisson reduction theorem. As in Section 7.2’s proof, two main ingredients will be:

(a): the diﬀeomorphism ˆ¯λ between T ∗G/G and g∗ (eq. 4.117 or 7.5 or 7.6), and
(b): the Poisson reduction theorem of Section 5.5, applied to G’s action on T ∗G.
But instead of Section 7.2’s proof’s using the facts that (i) the momentum maps JR ≡
T ∗
e Lg and JL ≡ T ∗
e Rg are equivariant and (ii) equivariant momentum maps are Poisson,
we will now use the ideas of invariant functions and momentum functions.

We begin by recalling that (since left translation is a diﬀeomorphism of G, and the
cotangent lift of any diﬀeomorphism of a manifold to its cotangent bundle is symplec-
tic), the Poisson reduction theorem implies that there is a unique Poisson structure
on T ∗G/G such that π : T ∗G → T ∗G/G is Poisson. We now use the diﬀeomorphism
ˆ¯λ : T ∗G/G → g∗ to transfer this Poisson structure to g∗. Let us call the result {, }−.
Though this is not to be read (yet!) as the negative Lie-Poisson bracket, our aim now
is to calculate that it is in fact this bracket.

Notice ﬁrst that since the momentum map JR : T ∗G → g∗, αg 7→ (T ∗

e Lg)αg is equal
to ˆ¯λ ◦ π (eq. 7.7), we know that JR is Poisson with respect to this induced bracket on
g∗. That is

{F, H}− ◦ JR (αg) = {F ◦ JR, H ◦ JR}T ∗G (αg) = {FL, HL}T ∗G (αg) .

(7.20)

123

To calculate the right hand side, we will apply the ideas of invariant functions and
momentum functions to each argument of the bracket; in particular to the ﬁrst:

FL(αg) = F (T ∗

e Lg · αg) .

(7.21)

We observe that since a Poisson bracket depends only on the values of ﬁrst deriva-
tives, we can replace F ∈ F (g∗) by its linearization. That is, we can assume F is linear,
so that at any point α ∈ g∗, F (α) =< α; ∇F >, where ∇F is a constant in g ≡ g∗∗.
Applying this, and the deﬁnition of a momentum function eq. 6.59, to eq. 7.21, we
get:

F (T ∗

e Lg · αg) = < T ∗

e Lg · αg; ∇F > = < αg; TeLg · ∇F > = P(X∇F )(αg) ,

(7.22)

where the last equation applies the deﬁnition of a momentum function to the left-
invariant vector ﬁeld on G, Xξ(g) ≡ TeLg(ξ), for the case ξ = ∇F .

Now we apply to eq. 7.22, in order: eq. 6.64, the deﬁnition of the Lie algebra
bracket (cf. eq. 3.46), eq. 6.59 again, and the deﬁnition of left-invariant vector ﬁelds.
We get:

{FL, HL}T ∗G (αg) = {P(X∇F ), P(X∇H)}T ∗G (αg) = −P([X∇F , X∇H])(αg) (7.23)
= −P(X[∇F ,∇H])(αg) = − < αg; X[∇F ,∇H] > (7.24)
e Lg(αg); [∇F , ∇H] > . (7.25)

= − < αg; TeLg([∇F , ∇H]) > = − < T ∗

Combining eq. 7.20 and eq. 7.25, and writing α ∈ g∗ for (T ∗
our result:

e Lg)αg ≡ JR(αg), we have

{F, H}−(α) = − < α; [∇F , ∇H] > .

(7.26)

One similarly derives the positive Lie-Poisson bracket by considering right-invariant
extensions of linear functions. The minus sign coming from eq. 6.64 is cancelled by the
sign reversal in the Lie bracket of right-invariant vector ﬁelds. That is, it is cancelled
by a minus sign coming from eq. 3.58.

7.4 Reduction of dynamics

We end our account of the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem by discussing the reduction
of dynamics from T ∗G to g∗.

We can be brief since we have already stated the main idea, when discussing the
Poisson reduction theorem; cf.
(2)(A) in Section 5.5. Thus recall that (under the
conditions of the theorem) a G-invariant Hamiltonian function on a Poisson manifold
M, H : M → IR, deﬁnes a corresponding function h on M/G by H = h ◦ π, where π
is the projection π : M → M/G; and since π is Poisson, and so pushes Hamiltonian
ﬂows forward to Hamiltonian ﬂows, π pushes XH on M to Xh on M/G:

T π ◦ XH = Xh ◦ π .

(7.27)

Applying this, in particular eq. 7.27, to the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem, we get

124

Reduction of dynamics Let H : T ∗G → IR be left-invariant. That is:
the function H − := H |g∗ on g∗ satisﬁes

H(αg) = H −(JR(αg)) ≡ H −(T ∗

e Lg · αg) , αg ∈ T ∗

g G .

(7.28)

Then JR pushes XH forward to XH −. Or in terms of the ﬂows φ(t) and
φ−(t) of XH and XH − respectively:

JR(φ(t)(αg)) = φ−(t)(JR(αg)) .

(7.29)

Similar statements hold for a right-invariant function H : T ∗G → IR, its
restriction H + := H |g∗ and JL ≡ T ∗
e Rg.

Besides, we already know the vector ﬁeld of H − on g∗. For eq. 5.30 in (3) of Section
5.2.4 gave a basis-independent expression of Hamilton’s equations on g∗ in terms of ad∗.
We just need to note that since we are now using the negative Lie-Poisson bracket on
g∗, all terms in the deduction (eq. 5.29) apart from the left hand side, get a minus
sign. So writing α ∈ g∗, eq. 5.30 for the vector ﬁeld XH − becomes:

(7.30)

(7.31)

(7.32)

dα
dt

= − ad∗

∇H −(α)(α) .

g−1 ˙g = ∇H − .

On the other hand, we can go in the other direction, reconstructing the dynamics
on T ∗G from eq. 7.30 on g∗. The statement of the main result, below, is intuitive, in
that the “reconstruction equation” for g(t) ∈ T ∗G is

This is intuitive since it returns us to the basic idea of mechanics on g and g∗, viz. that
the map

λg : ˙g ∈ TgG 7→ λg( ˙g) := (TgLg−1) ˙g ∈ g

maps the generalized velocity to its body representation; cf. eq. 4.90. However, the
proof of this result is involved (Marsden and Ratiu (1999: theorems 13.4.3, 13.4.4, p.
423-426); so we only state the result. It is:—

Reconstruction of dynamics Suppose given a Lie group G, a left-invariant
H : T ∗G → IR, its restriction H − := H |g∗, and an integral curve α(t) of the
Lie-Poisson Hamilton’s equations eq. 7.30 on g∗, with the initial condition
α(0) = T ∗

e Lg0(αg0). Then the integral curve in T ∗G of XH is given by

where g(t) is the solution of the reconstruction equation

with initial condition g(0) = g0.

T ∗
g(t)Lg(t)−1(α(t)) ;

g−1 ˙g = ∇H −

7.5 Envoi: the Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer theorem

I emphasize that our discussion of reduction has only scratched the surface: after all
this Section has been relatively short! But now that the reader is armed with the long
and leisurely exposition from Section 3 onwards, they are well placed to pursue the
topic of reduction; e.g. through this Chapter’s main sources, Abraham and Marsden
(1978), Arnold (1989), Olver (2000) and Marsden and Ratiu (1999).

In particular, the reader can now relate the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem to an-
other main theorem about symplectic reduction, usually called the Marsden-Weinstein-
Meyer or Marsden-Weinstein theorem (after these authors’ papers in 1973 and 1974).
This theorem concerns a symplectic action of a Lie group G on a symplectic man-
ifold (M, ω). For the sake of completeness, and to orient the reader to Landsman’s
discussion of this theorem (this vol., ch. 5, especially Section 4.5), it is worth stating it
(as usual, for the ﬁnite-dimensional case only), together with the lemma used to prove
it, and the ensuing reduction of dynamics. These statements will also round oﬀ our
discussion by illustrating how some notions expounded from Section 3 onwards, but
not used in this Section, are nevertheless useful—e.g. in stating the hypotheses of this
theorem.

So suppose the Lie group G acts symplectically (eq. 6.1) on the symplectic manifold
(M, ω); and that J : M → g∗ is an Ad∗-equivariant momentum map for this action
(eq. 6.47 and 6.52). Assume also that α ∈ g∗ is a regular value of J, i.e. that at every
point x ∈ J−1(α), TxJ is surjective. So the submersion theorem of (1) of Section 3.3.1
applies; in particular, J−1(α) is a sub-manifold of M with dimension dim(M) - dim(g∗)
≡ dim(M) - dim(G).

Let Gα be the isotropy group (eq. 4.33) of α under the co-adjoint action, i.e.

Gα := {g ∈ G | Ad∗

g−1α = α}.

(7.35)

So since J is Ad∗-equivariant under Gα, the quotient space Mα := J−1(α)/Gα is well-
deﬁned.

Now assume that Gα acts freely and properly on J−1(α), so that (Section 4.3.B)
the quotient space Mα = J−1(α)/Gα is a manifold. Mα is the reduced phase space
(corresponding to the momentum value α).

Now we assert:

Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer theorem Mα has a natural symplectic form
ωα induced from (M, ω) as follows. Let u, v be two vectors tangent to Mα
at some point p ∈ Mα: so p is an orbit of Gα’s action on J−1(α), and
u, v ∈ TpMα. Then u and v are obtained, respectively, from some vectors
u′ and v′ tangent to J−1(α) at some point x ∈ J−1(α) of the orbit p, by the
projection πα : J−1(α) → Mα. That is:

T πα(u′) = u ; T πα(v′) = v .

(7.36)

126

It turns out that the value assigned by M’s symplectic form ω is the same
whatever choice of x, u′, v′ is made. So we deﬁne the symplectic form ωα on
Mα as assigning this value. In other words: writing πα for the projection,
iα : J−1(α) → M for the inclusion, and ∗ for pullback:

αωα = i∗
π∗

αω .

(7.37)

The proof of this theorem uses the following Lemma. Let us write G · x for the
orbit Orb(x) of x under the action of all of G, and similarly Gα · x for the orbit under
Gα, i.e. {Φ(g, x) | g ∈ Gα}. Then the Lemma states:

For any x ∈ J−1(α):—
(i): Tx(Gα · x) = Tx(G · x) ∩ Tx(J−1(α)); and
(ii): Tx(G · x) and Tx(J−1(α)) are ω-orthogonal complements of one another
in T M. That is: for all u′ ∈ TxM:
u′ ∈ Tx(J−1(α)) iﬀ ω(u′, v′) = 0 for all v′ ∈ Tx(G · x).

Both the Lemma and the theorem are each proven in some dozen lines. For details,
cf. Abraham and Marsden (1978: Theorems 4.3.1-2, p. 299-300), or Arnold (1989:
Appendix 5.B, p. 374-376).

Two ﬁnal remarks.

(1): The reduction of dynamics secured by the Marsden-
Weinstein-Meyer theorem is similar to what we have seen before, for both the Poisson
reduction theorem ((2) of Section 5.5), and the Lie-Poisson reduction theorem (Section
7.4). One proves, again in a few lines (Abraham and Marsden (1978: Theorems 4.3.5,
p. 304):

Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer reduction of dynamics Let H : M → IR
be invariant under the action of G on M, so that by Noether’s theorem
for momentum maps (Section 6.2) J is conserved, i.e. J−1(α) is invariant
under the ﬂow φ(t) of XH on M. Then φ(t) commutes with the action of
Gα on J−1(α) (i.e. φ(t) ◦ Φg = Φg ◦ φ(t) for g ∈ Gα), and so deﬁnes a ﬂow
ˆφ(t) on Mα such that πα ◦ φ(t) = ˆφ(t) ◦ πα, i.e.

J−1(α)

φ(t)
x
J−1(α)



πα−→

Mα

πα−→

ˆφ(t)

x
Mα



(7.38)

The ﬂow ˆφ(t) is Hamiltonian with the Hamiltonian Hα deﬁned by Hα ◦πα =
H ◦ iα.

(2): I said at the start of this Subsection that the reader can now relate the Lie-
Poisson reduction theorem to the Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer theorem. It is not hard
to show that the former is an example of the latter. As the symplectic manifold M

127

one takes T ∗G, acted on symplectically by the cotangent lift of left translation. So we
know (from (3) of Section 6.5.3) that JL := T ∗
e Rg is an Ad∗-equivariant momentum
map ... and so on: I leave this as an exercise for the reader! The answer is supplied
at Arnold (1989: 377, 321) and Abraham and Marsden (1978: 302). (Abraham and
Marsden call it the ‘Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau theorem’.)

Suﬃce it to say here that this exercise gives another illustration of one of our central
themes, that g∗’s symplectic leaves are the orbits of the co-adjoint representation. For
the reduced phase space Mα is naturally identiﬁable with the co-adjoint orbit Orb(α)
of α ∈ g∗, with the symplectic forms also naturally identiﬁed; (cf. also result (2) at the
end of Section 5.4).

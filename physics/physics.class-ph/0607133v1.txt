Abstract

In this paper we study microstrip antenna miniaturization using partial ﬁlling of the antenna
volume with dielectric materials. An analytical expression is derived for the quality factor of
an antenna loaded with a combination of two diﬀerent materials. This expression can be used
to optimize the ﬁlling pattern for the design that most eﬃciently retains the impedance band-
width after size reduction. Qualitative design rules are given, and a miniaturization example
is provided where the antenna performance is compared for diﬀerent ﬁlling patterns. Results
given by the analytical model are veriﬁed with numerical simulations and experiments.

Key words: Microstrip antenna, miniaturization, partial ﬁlling, impedance bandwidth, quality
factor.

1 Introduction

A microstrip antenna is nowadays one of the most commonly used antenna types. This is
because of its robust design that allows cheap manufacturing using the beneﬁts of printed
circuit board technology.

The main drawbacks of this antenna are its large size and narrow bandwidth. Among many
existing approaches to patch size reduction (meandering the patch, introduction of shorting
posts, etc.), one of the most commonly used miniaturization methods of microstrip antennas is
loading of the antenna volume with dielectric materials [1]–[4]. However, a dielectric loading is
known to lead to a dramatically reduced impedance bandwidth [5, 6].

Alternative approaches to path miniaturization may include the use of magnetic substrates,
which is known to be advantageous in terms of the antenna bandwidth [7]. However, available
natural magnetic materials have rather weak magnetic properties and are rather lossy in the mi-
crowave frequency range. The use of artiﬁcial materials (metamaterials) was recently analysed
in [8, 9], and it was shown that due to their dispersion the magnetic response of the substrate
does not give an advantage as compared to usual dielectrics. As one of the possibilities, the
use of non-uniform material ﬁllings was identiﬁed in [8]: A non-uniform ﬁlling can modify the
current distribution on the patch and lead to increased radiation, this way compensating the
negative eﬀect of increased reactive energy stored in the ﬁlling material. In this paper we sys-
tematically explore this miniaturization scenario for the case of non-uniform dielectric ﬁllings.
Earlier, partial ﬁlling was studied with the aim to reduce the antenna size in [10] and with the
aim to modify the standing wave pattern on the antenna element and broaden the bandwidth
in [11]. The conclusions of these two papers are contradictory, which is another motivation for
a systematic study. The ﬁndings of this paper are compared to the conclusions of [10, 11] at
the end of the paper.

First, we derive an analytical expression for the current and voltage distribution on the antenna
element loaded with a combination of two arbitrary dispersive low-loss materials. These expres-
sions can be used to ﬁnd a ﬁlling pattern that optimizes the current and voltage distributions
in a way that the quality factor is minimized. We present an example miniaturization scheme
where the antenna is partially ﬁlled with a conventional dielectric material sample located at
diﬀerent positions under the antenna element. Qualitative design rules are given, and the results
obtained from the analytical model are validated by numerical simulations and experiments.

2 Analytical model for partially ﬁlled microstrip anten-

nas

In this section we derive the voltage and current distribution for a microstrip antenna loaded
with a combination of two arbitrary low-loss materials. Further, from these distributions we
calculate the radiation quality factor via the stored electromagnetic energy and the radiated
power. We conduct the derivation for a quarter-wavelength patch antenna shorted at one end,
however, the model can be easily extended for half-wavelength patch antennas.

2.1 Voltage and current distribution

A microstrip antenna lying on top of a large, non-resonant ground plane and ﬁlled with two ma-
terials is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. The antenna can be modeled as a transmission-line
segment having certain characteristic impedances, shunt susceptance, and radiation conduc-
tance that depend on the dimensions of the antenna and on the substrate materials [1, 4]. For
the derivation we express the current and voltage waves in section 1 using coordinate x and in
section 2 using x′. The coordinate transformation is x′ = x
a, where a is the physical length
of the ﬁrst substrate, Fig. 1.

The voltage and current distributions in both substrates can be written as:

where A, B, C and D are the amplitudes of the waves (propagating along two directions),
and Y1 and Y2 are the characteristic admittances of the transmission-line segments ﬁlled with
materials 1 and 2, respectively. k1 = k0√ε1,eﬀµ1,eﬀ and k2 = k0√ε2,eﬀµ2,eﬀ are the wavenumbers
in media 1 and 2, εeﬀ and µeﬀ are the eﬀective substrate material parameters. The characteristic

In addition to the continuity conditions at the interface between the two substrates (x = a,
x′ = 0), we get two boundary conditions at the shorted edge of the patch. These conditions
can be written as

2.2 Stored electromagnetic energy and radiation quality factor

At this stage we make the assumption that both substrates have low losses. Moreover, we
assume that the height of the antenna is small and deﬁne the amplitudes of the electric and

Let us check the above formulae for the radiation quality factor by considering a particular
situation where the substrate 1 is half of the wavelength long (a = λ/2), and substrate 2 is
quarter of the wavelength long (a′ = λ/4). The voltage and current distribution in substrate
1 should then correspond to an open-ended half-wavelength patch antenna. Let us further
suppose that the patch loaded with substrate 1 would radiate from both ends, thus, Gr

3 Impedance bandwidth behavior of partially ﬁlled mi-

crostrip antennas

In this section we study the impedance bandwidth properties of λ/4-patch antennas when the
antenna volume is partially loaded with diﬀerent dielectric material loads located at diﬀerent
positions under the antenna element. The results given by the analytical model are veriﬁed
with numerical simulations and experiments. The known fundamental limit for the radiation
quality factor of electrically small antennas reads [14]:

Qr =

1
0R3 +
k3

1
k0R

,

(23)

where k0 is the free-space wavenumber and R is the radius of the smallest sphere enclosing the
antenna. According to Eq. (23), the limit does not depend on the substrate that occupies the
volume under the antenna element, because Eq. (23) takes into account only the ﬁelds outside
the antenna volume. This gives us the freedom to choose the substrate and its position under
the antenna element freely as long as the material is enclosed by the sphere. Thus, for the sake
of future comparisons we ﬁx the total volume and the resonant frequency of the antenna.

3.1 Results following from the analytical model

As an example, we have studied an antenna with the following dimensions: w = 70 mm, l = 20
mm, h = 4 mm (Fig. 2). We consider three diﬀerent ﬁlling patterns:

1) The antenna is completely ﬁlled with a dielectric substrate.

2) Position 1 is ﬁlled with a substrate and position 2 is empty.

3) Position 1 is empty and position 2 is ﬁlled with a substrate.

With all the ﬁlling patterns the resonant frequency of the antenna is kept at f = 2 GHz. Thus,
depending on the ﬁlling pattern we alter the relative permittivity of the substrate as shown in
Table 1. The current and voltage distributions corresponding to diﬀerent ﬁlling patterns are
shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding impedance bandwidth results (quality factors) are listed
in Table 1.

Figure 3: The voltage and current distributions in arbitrary units (Color ﬁgure can be viewed in the
online issue).

According to the results presented in Table 1, the most optimal location for the dielectric
load in terms of the minimized radiation quality factor is position 1.
It is seen in Fig. 3
that placing the substrate to position 1 leads to the highest voltage and current magnitudes
along the patch. These higher magnitudes increase the stored energy, however, the higher
radiation voltage (open-edge voltage) increases the radiated power. In this particular example
this increase outweighs the eﬀect of increased stored energy. When the substrate is placed
to position 2, the voltage and current magnitudes are the lowest of all the considered cases.
However, even though the amount of stored energy is the smallest, also the radiated power is
small and the radiation quality factor is the highest of all considered cases.

Results in Table 1 also show that lower permittivity dielectrics are needed to retain the resonant
frequency when the substrate is placed near the open edge where the electric response is the
strongest.

3.2 Simulation results

In this section we simulate the antenna structure introduced above. The purpose is to validate
the results given by the analytical model. We use a method of moments based simulation

software IE3D. The ground plane is inﬁnite in the simulation setup. To ensure that the radiation
conductance is not aﬀected by the substrate and corresponds as closely as possible to the
analytical model we leave a 0.5 mm long empty section before the radiating edge. The antenna
is fed with a narrow matching strip having length lf = 10 mm and width wf = 0.5 mm connected
to a 50 Ω probe.

The fractional impedance bandwidth and the unloaded quality factor Q0 can be calculated by
representing the antenna as a parallel RLC circuit in the vicinity of the fundamental resonant
frequency and using the input voltage standing wave ratio S: [15]

Above, the coupling coeﬃcient for a parallel resonant circuit is T = R0/Z0, where R0 is the
resonant resistance and Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the feed line. The voltage standing
wave ratio is deﬁned as:

We use a ρ =

6 dB matching criterion to deﬁne the impedance bandwidth.

−

The simulation results are shown in Table 1. The simulation software gives quite accurately the
same resonant frequencies for the three diﬀerent cases with nearly the same material parameters
as the analytical model.

When position 2 is ﬁlled with the substrate, the analytical model overestimates the required
substrate permittivity, and thus, predicts a higher Q0. The analytical model assumes that the
shorting metal plate is perfectly conducting whereas the ﬁnite conductivity of metal is taken
into account in the simulations. When the shorting plate has a certain eﬀective impedance, the
electric response near the plate would slightly increase due to a small increase in the electric
ﬁeld magnitude. This would lower the needed permittivity value.

3.3 Measured results

In this subsection we present some measurement results that further validate the analytical
model. We have accurately replicated the antenna described in the previous sections. In the
30 cm2, and we load diﬀerent portions of position 1
measurements the ground plane size is 30
with dielectric substrates having diﬀerent permittivity values. The permittivity is altered from
case to case in order to keep the resonant frequency ﬁxed at 2 GHz. The loss tangent of the
substrates is approximately 0.0027 in all cases.

×

The analytical value for ε1 is calculated using Eq. (11) and setting x = 0. The current amplitude
at the open edge of our quarter wavelength antenna is zero at the resonant frequency. Knowing
the resonant frequency (fr = 2 GHz) and the permittivity of the material in position 2 (ε2 = 1),
ε1 can be solved using Eq. (11).

The measured impedance bandwidths (the unloaded quality factors) are shown in Fig. 4 and
compared with the analytical results and simulated results. In the simulations the loss tangent is
0.001 in all cases. The corresponding permittivity values for each case are shown in Fig. 5. The
measured quality factors and the corresponding permittivities agree well with the simulations

measurement cases (Color ﬁgure can be viewed in the online issue).

and with the analytical model. The diﬀerence in the results given by the analytical model and
the measurements increase as the volume occupied by the substrate increases. This is expected
since in the analytical model the corresponding increase in the dielectric losses is not taken into
consideration.

3.4 Comparison with the results known from the literature

Let us compare the qualitative observations of our paper with the conclusions presented in
[11]. In [11] the authors aim to broaden the impedance bandwidth of their example antenna
by placing high permittivity dielectrics to the locations where the electric ﬁeld magnitude is
low, and low permittivity dielectrics where the electric ﬁeld magnitude is strong. The aim is to
create a more uniform ﬁeld distribution in the antenna element. To demonstrate the feasibility
3.4 mm3 λ/2-patch antenna completely with a
of the method the authors ﬁrst load a 18
12.6. In the second case portions of the substrate having length λ/12 are
substrate having εr
replaced near the open edges by a substrate having εr
2.2. The reported resonant frequencies
of the antennas are f = 2.12 GHz and f = 2.86 GHz. The authors compare qualitatively
the impedance bandwidths and mention that partial ﬁlling is a feasible method to eﬃciently
miniaturize microstrip antennas.

3.4 mm3
Here we will qualitatively replicate the comparison scheme of [11] using a 18
λ/4-patch antenna. The antenna is divided into positions 1 and 2 as in Fig. 2. The length
of position 1 is l/3 and the length of position 2 is 2l/3. When the antenna volume is ﬁlled
completely with a high-permittivity substrate having εr = 19.9 we get from the analytical model
f = 2.13 GHz and Qr = 245. Next we ﬁll position 1 with a substrate having εr = 4.4 and
use the high-permittivity substrate with εr = 19.9 in position 2. This leads to fr = 2.87 GHz
and Qr = 134. We cannot, however, readily compare the quality factors as the two antennas
operate at diﬀerent frequencies. When comparing the impedance bandwidth properties of two
antennas having the same volume and diﬀerent resonant frequencies the proper ﬁgure-of-merit
f 3 as is seen from Eq. (23). Partial ﬁlling gives a higher value for this ﬁgure-of-merit,
is Qr
thus, the impedance bandwidth vs. size characteristics of the antenna are actually better in
the case of uniform ﬁlling. If the resonant frequency of the partially ﬁlled antenna is brought
to f = 2.13 GHz we need to ﬁll position 2 with a substrate having εr = 40. This leads to
Qr = 330. Since the two antennas operate now at the same frequency, we can directly compare
the quality factors. Higher value for the partially ﬁlled case indicates that the ﬁlling scheme
proposed in [11] is not optimal in terms of retained impedance bandwidth. As is shown in our
paper, high-permittivity dielectrics need to be positioned to the locations where the electric
ﬁeld amplitude is the strongest.

×

The conclusion of paper [10] is that for eﬀective size reduction a dielectric block should be
positioned close to the radiating patch edges. This is in harmony with the conclusions from
the above analysis.

4 Conclusions

We have derived the voltage and current distribution for a microstrip antenna loaded with two
arbitrary dispersive and low-loss substrates. This model can be used to ﬁnd the ﬁlling pattern
that minimizes the antenna quality factor. We have presented an example miniaturization
scheme where the antenna is partially ﬁlled with a conventional dielectric material blocks located
in diﬀerent positions under the antenna element. Qualitative design rules are given and the
results of the analytical model are validated by numerical simulations and experiments. It has
been shown that high-permittivity dielectrics need to be positioned to the locations where the

10

electric ﬁeld amplitude is the strongest in order to minimize the quality factor.

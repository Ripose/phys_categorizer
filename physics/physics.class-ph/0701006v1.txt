In a recent paper Davis formulated the following generalization of the Helmholtz theorem

for a time-varying vector ﬁeld:1

F =

1
c2

∂
∂t (cid:18)

∇φ +

∂A
∂t (cid:19)

+ ∇ × (∇ × A),

(1)

where φ and A are the Lorenz gauge retarded potentials. The purposes of this comment are

to point out that Davis’s generalization is a version of the generalization of the Helmholtz
theorem formulated some years ago by McQuistan2 and Jeﬁmenko3 and more recently by
the present author4–6 and to show that Davis’s expression for the ﬁeld F is also valid for

potentials in gauges other than the Lorenz gauge.

The generalized Helmholtz theorem states that a retarded vector ﬁeld vanishing at inﬁnity

can be written as4

F = −∇

where the square brackets denote the retardation symbol, R = |x − x′|, and the integrals

are over all space. If we deﬁne the potentials Φ, A, and C by

then Eq. (2) can be written compactly as

F = −∇Φ + ∇ × A +

.

The potentials Φ and A in this formulation of the theorem are diﬀerent from the potentials
φ and A in Davis’s formulation. It is not diﬃcult to derive the relations ∂φ/∂t = −c2Φ, ∇ ×
A = A, and ∂A/∂t = C, which imply the formal equivalence between the two formulations.

The standard Helmholtz theorem is usually applied to solve the equations of electrostat-
ics and magnetostatics. The generalization of this theorem4 can be used to solve Maxwell’s
equations. The generalization proposed by Davis1 can be used to elucidate the form of

Maxwell’s equations. The two versions of the generalized Helmholtz theorem are comple-

mentary.

In Ref. 1 the electric ﬁeld −∇φ − ∂A/∂t and the magnetic ﬁeld ∇ × A are expressed in

terms of the Lorenz gauge potentials, which were used to formulate Eq. (1) for the time-
varying vector ﬁeld F . Equation (1) can also be formulated using potentials in other gauges.
For example, it can be formulated for potentials in the velocity gauge7 ∇·A+(1/v2)∂φ/∂t =

0, a class of gauges containing the Coulomb gauge (v = ∞), the Lorentz gauge (v = c), and
the Kirchhoﬀ gauge8 (v = ic). Jackson7 recently derived the gauge function χv (Eq. (7.5)
of Ref. 7), which transforms the Lorenz gauge potentials φL and AL to the velocity gauge
potentials φv and Av:

From Eqs. (5) we obtain

φv = φL −

∂χv
∂t

,

Av = AL + ∇χv.

∇φL +

= ∇φv +

∂AL

∂Av
∂t

∇ × AL = ∇ × Av.

Equations (6) imply that Eq. (1) is also valid for potentials in the velocity gauge, which

means that it is valid for the Coulomb and Kirchhoﬀ gauges also. The application of Eq.
(1) to potentials in the velocity gauge requires the identiﬁcation F = µ0J, where J is the

current density and µ0 the permeability of free space.

Davis introduced causality in Eq. (1) when he chose retarded potentials. But we can

equally choose acausal advanced potentials to obtain Eq. (1). Causality in Eq. (1) is not
a necessary assumption, but it is required to identify −∇φ − ∂A/∂t and ∇ × A with the
retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds. As pointed out by Rohrlich,9 causality must be inserted

by hand in classical ﬁeld theories as a condition.

The reader might wonder why Eq. (1) can also be written in terms of the Coulomb gauge

potentials when the instantaneous scalar potential φC in this gauge is clearly acausal. The

explanation is that the Coulomb gauge vector potential AC contains two parts, one of which
is causal (retarded) and the other is acausal (instantaneous). Jackson7 recently derived a

novel expression for AC (Eq. (3.10) in Ref. 7) which exhibits both parts. The fact that AC

carries a causality-violating instantaneous component has also been recently emphasized by
Yang.10 The eﬀect of the acausal part of AC vanishes identically when we take the curl and
obtain ∇ × AC = ∇ × AL. A direct calculation gives7 −∂AC/∂t = −∇φL − ∂AL/∂t + ∇φC.

The last (acausal) term cancels exactly the instantaneous electric ﬁeld −∇φC generated by
φC and we again obtain −∇φC − ∂AC/∂t = −∇φL − ∂AL/∂t. This expression has also been

recently demonstrated in Ref. 11 using a diﬀerent approach (see Eq. (29) in Ref. 11). In

other words, the explicit presence of an acausal term in Eq. (1) when it is written in terms

of the Coulomb gauge potentials is irrelevant because such a term is always canceled, which

means that causality is never eﬀectively lost.

Similar conclusions can be drawn when Eq. (1) is expressed in terms of the Kirchhoﬀ
gauge potentials φK and AK.8 In this case the potential φK propagates with the imaginary

speed ic and generates the imaginary ﬁeld −∇φK. The Kirchhoﬀ gauge vector potential

AK contains three parts: one is causal (retarded), one is imaginary, and the remaining

one mixes imaginary and retarded contributions (see Eq. (42) in Ref. 8). The eﬀect of the

imaginary terms in the last two parts vanishes identically when we take the curl and obtain
∇ × AK = ∇ × AL. A direct calculation gives8 −∂AK/∂t = −∇φL − ∂AL/∂t + ∇φK. The
last term cancels exactly the imaginary ﬁeld −∇φK and we again obtain −∇φK −∂AK/∂t =
−∇φL −∂AL/∂t. The explicit presence of an imaginary term in Eq. (1) when it is written in

terms of the Kirchhoﬀ gauge potentials is irrelevant because such a term is always canceled,

which means that causality is never eﬀectively lost.

In the same sense that the Helmholtz theorem is considered as the mathematical foun-

dation of electrostatics and magnetostatics, the generalized Helmholtz theorem can be con-

sidered as the mathematical foundation of electromagnetism. I advocate the use of both
formulations of the generalized Helmholtz theorem12 in courses of electromagnetism and

invite instructors to decide which formulation they ﬁnd more useful.

ABSTRACT

A three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (3D DNS) is performed to describe the turbulent ﬂow in
an enclosed rotor-stator cavity characterized by a large aspect ratio G = (b − a)/h = 18.32 and a small
radius ratio a/b = 0.15 (a and b the inner and outer radii of the rotating disk and h the interdisk spacing).
Recent comparisons with velocity measurements [1] have shown that, for the rotational Reynolds number
Re = Ωb2/ν = 95000 (Ω the rate of rotation of the rotating disk and ν the kinematic viscosity of water)
under consideration, the stator boundary layer is 3D turbulent and the rotor one is still laminar. Budgets for
the turbulence kinetic energy are here presented and highlight some characteristic features of the effect of
rotation on turbulence. A quadrant analysis of conditionally averaged velocities is also performed to identify
the contributions of different events (ejections and sweeps) on the Reynolds shear stress.

INTRODUCTION

Besides its primary concern to many industrial
applications, the rotor-stator problem has proved
a fruitful means of studying turbulence in con-
ﬁned rotating ﬂows. This speciﬁc conﬁguration
is indeed among the simplest ones where rota-
tion brings signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the tur-
bulent ﬁeld. The present paper is devoted to the
study of the turbulent ﬂow in an enclosed high-
speed rotor-stator system of large aspect ratio.
The ﬂow is of Batchelor type and belongs to the
regime denoted IV by Daily and Nece [2]. These
authors provided an estimated value for the local
Reynolds number at which turbulence originates
with separated boundary layers, Rer = Ωr2/ν =
1.5 × 105 (r the radial location) for G ≤ 25.
However, experiments have revealed that transi-
tion to turbulence can appear at a lower value
of the Reynolds number within the stator bound-

ary layer (the B¨odewadt layer), even though the
ﬂow remains laminar in the rotor boundary layer
(the Ekman layer). Recently, the 3D computed
solution presented here has been compared to ve-
locity measurements performed at IRPHE [1]. It
has been shown that, for the rotational Reynolds
number Re = 95000, the B¨odewadt layer is tur-
bulent and the rotor one is still laminar. The pur-
pose of this work is to provide detailed data of
the turbulent boundary layer along the stator side
in a large enclosed system (G = 18.32).

NUMERICAL APPROACH

The numerical approach is based on a pseudo-
spectral technique using Chebyshev polynomials
in the radial and axial directions with Fourier se-
ries in the azimuthal direction associated with a
semi-implicit second order time scheme. An ef-

ﬁcient projection method is introduced to solve
the pressure-velocity coupling. A grid resolution
composed of N × M × K = 300 × 80 × 100
respectively in radial, axial and azimuthal direc-
tions has been used, with a dimensionless time
step δt = 2.75 × 10−3. Numerical computations
have been carried out on NEC SX-5 (IDRIS, Or-
say, France).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The detailed description of the mean ﬁeld and of
the axial variations of the Reynolds stress tensor
is given in [1]. Nevertheless, we recall the main
results. A good agreement has been obtained be-
tween the 3D solution and the experimental data,
whereas the axisymetric solution leads to a steady
laminar ﬂow. The ﬂow is of Batchelor type: the
two boundary layers developed on each disk are
separated by a central rotating core characterized
by a quasi zero radial velocity and a constant
tangential velocity. The B¨odewadt layer along
the stator is centripetal, three-dimensional as the
Townsend structural parameter is lower than the
limit value 0.15, and turbulent with turbulence in-
tensities increasing from the axis to the periphery
of the cavity. On the contrary, the Ekman layer
on the rotor is centrifugal and laminar. The tur-
bulence is observed by the formation of turbulent
spots developing along spiral arms towards the
periphery of the cavity, as seen in ﬁgure 1 from
the instantaneous iso-values of the turbulence ki-
netic energy within the stator boundary layer.

The balance equation for the turbulence kinetic
energy k can be written:

Figures 2a and 2b show the axial variations along
z∗ = z/h of the different terms involved in the

(1)

transport equation (1) at two radial locations. It
is clearly seen that all these terms vanish towards
the rotor side (z∗ = 0), conﬁrming the lami-
nar nature of this zone up to the stator bound-
ary layer (z∗ = 1). At the stator wall, the vis-
cous diffusion balances the dissipation as well
known in 3D turbulent boundary layer. Within
the B¨odewadt layer, even though some interac-
tion between the different terms involved is ob-
served, the major contributions come from the
production, the dissipation and the viscous dif-
fusion terms. The production is balanced by the
dissipation and the viscous diffusion, the level of
which increases in association with the thicken-
ing of the boundary layer towards the periphery.
The production increases with increasing radius
as already observed with the levels of the nor-
mal Reynolds stresses [1]. The maximum of the
production term is obtained at the wall coordi-
nate z+ = zvτ /ν = 12 (vτ = ((ν∂Vθ/∂z)2 +
(ν∂Vr/∂z)2)1/4 the total friction velocity and z
the axial coordinate) for r/b = 0.56 and at z+ =
12.5 for r/b = 0.8, which conﬁrms the approx-
imately self-similar behavior of the B¨odewadt
layer. The levels of the viscous diffusion increase
when moving towards the outer casing, where the
highest turbulence intensities prevail. It indicates
that viscous effects still play an important role in
the turbulence towards these regions, which does
not allow for a distinct delineation of the viscous
sublayer. This indicates also the weak nature of
the turbulence obtained at this Reynolds number.

Conditional-averaged quadrant analysis

To gain a better insight on the near-wall struc-
ture of the turbulent boundary layer along the
stator side, a conditional-averaged quadrant anal-
ysis is performed to identify the contributions
of intense intermittent bursting events (ejections
and sweeps) on the Reynolds shear stress pro-
ducing vortical structures. It corresponds to four
subdivisions of the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld according to
the combination of the tangential v′
θ and axial

applied at z+ = 17 corresponding to the lo-
cation of the maximum value of the turbulent
shear stress. We have also considered the value
β = 2 to determine strong events, as used in
[3,4]. We display in ﬁgures 3a and 3b the varia-
tions with ∆r+ = r ± r+ (r+ the wall coordinate
in the radial direction) of the conditionally aver-

θv′

aged Reynolds shear stress normalized by the un-
conditionally ensemble averaged Reynolds shear
stress < v′
z > near a strong ejection (ﬁg.3a)
and a strong sweep (ﬁg.3b). The contributions
of each quadrant are also presented. The ﬁgures
3a and 3b clearly show that the ejection (Q2)
and sweep (Q4) quadrants contribute much more
to the Reynolds shear stress production than the
two other quadrants. On the other hand, it seems
that the weakness of the turbulence in the present
simulation accentuates the features observed in
previous works. The results obtained support the
conclusions of Littell and Eaton [3] and Lygren
and Andersson [5], in contrast with the ﬁndings
of Kang et al. [4]: the asymmetries observed
are dominated by Reynolds stress-producing co-
herent structures (sweep and ejection). Lygren
and Andersson [5] concluded that clockwise vor-
tices contribute much more to the Reynolds shear
stress than counter-clockwise vortices. The same
behavior applies in the presence of a sweep event.
In this case, the levels of the surrounding ejec-
tions approach the strong sweep level and are
even slightly beyond the ﬁxed criterion condition
β = 2, as seen in ﬁgure 3b, while the levels of
sweeps around a strong ejection are less impor-
tant (ﬁg.3a), in agreement with the results of [5].
Case 1 vortices, having induced near-wall veloc-
ity in the direction of the crossﬂow, are found
to be the major source of generation of special
strong events.

CONCLUSION

DNS calculations have been used to describe the
turbulent boundary layer along the stator side
in a large enclosed rotor-stator cavity. For the
rotational Reynolds number under consideration
Re = 9.5 × 104, the B¨odewadt layer is 3D tur-
bulent, whereas the Ekman layer on the rotor is
still laminar. The transition to turbulence is asso-
ciated with the onset of localized turbulent spots
spiraling up along the stator side. The turbulence

kinetic energy budgets have revealed that produc-
tion is the major contribution with a maximum
obtained at z+ ≃ 12 independently of the ra-
dial location, conﬁrming the self-similar behavior
of the B¨odewadt layer. The results of the quad-
rant analysis support the conclusions proposed
by [3,5]. The asymmetries observed by these au-
thors have been clearly detected and the analysis
of conditionally averaged streamwise and wall-
normal velocity components conﬁrms that these
asymmetries mainly arise from the contributions
of quadrants Q2 and Q4, responsible for the gen-
eration of ejection and sweep events. Therefore,
Case 1 vortices are found to be the major source
of generation of special strong events.

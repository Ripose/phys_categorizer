Abstract

The fully relativistic theory of the Zeeman splitting of the 1s hyperﬁne structure levels in
hydrogenlike ions is considered for the magnetic ﬁeld magnitude in the range from 1 to 10 T.
The second-order corrections to the Breit – Rabi formula are calculated and discussed. The
results can be used for a precise determination of nuclear magnetic moments from g factor
experiments.

1 Introduction

Recent measurements of the g factor of hydrogenlike carbon and oxygen have reached an accuracy
of about 7·10−10 [1–3]. Extensions of these measurements to ions with nonzero nuclear spin I would
provide the basis for new determinations of the nuclear magnetic moments [4] and the hyperﬁne
structure (HFS) splitting in hydrogenlike ions. Experimental investigations in this direction are
anticipated in the near future at GSI [5]. Corresponding values of the magnetic ﬁeld are supposed
to be in a range from 1 to 10 T.

For heavy ions with nonzero nuclear spin the ground state Zeeman splitting caused by the
magnetic ﬁeld in the range under consideration is much smaller than the hyperﬁne splitting and,
therefore, the consideration can be conveniently reduced to the g factor value [6]. However,
for ions with the nuclear charge number Z in the range Z = 1 − 20, which are being under
current experimental investigations at Mainz University, the Zeeman splitting is comparable with
the hyperﬁne splitting. This requires constructing the perturbation theory for quasidegenerate
states. To a good accuracy, the solution of the problem is given by the well-known Breit –
Rabi formula [7–9]. The aforesaid experimental precision has, however, shown the need for an
improvement of the Breit – Rabi formula.

In the present paper, we improve the Breit – Rabi formula for the 1s hyperﬁne structure levels
by calculating the second-order correction caused by the hyperﬁne interaction and the interaction
with the external magnetic ﬁeld. The obtained results are especially important for ions with
Z ≤ 20, where the 1s HFS splitting can be comparable with the Zeeman splitting if the magnitude
of the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld does not exceed 10 T.

Relativistic and Heaviside charge units (~ = c = 1 , α = e2/4π) are used in the paper, the
charge of the electron is taken to be e < 0. In some important cases, the ﬁnal formulas contain ~
and c explicitly to be applicable for arbitrary system of units.

2 The Breit – Rabi formula

We consider a H-like ion with nonzero nuclear spin I in a state with the total electron angular
momentum j = 1/2. The ion is placed in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld ~B directed along the z
axis. The magnetic splitting is linear with respect to ~B only if one of the following conditions is

fulﬁlled: either ∆Emag ≪ ∆EHFS or ∆Emag ≫ ∆EHFS, where ∆EHFS = E(F +1)−E(F ), E(F ) =
Enκ + εhfs(F ), F = I ± 1/2 is the total atomic angular momentum, and εhfs(F ) is the hyperﬁne
structure shift from the Dirac state with the energy

the state, nr = n − |κ| is the radial quantum number, γ =
and me is the electron mass.
It should be emphasized that in case the second inequality is
fulﬁlled ∆Emag must be much less than the distance to other Dirac’s levels. In the intermediate
~B case, ∆Emag ∼ ∆EHFS, we must take into account mixing the HFS sublevels with the same
MF , where MF = −F, −F + 1, ..., F − 1, F is the z projection of the total angular momentum.
For the states with j = 1/2, there are only two HFS levels F = I − 1/2 and F ′ = I + 1/2
with the same MF = −I + 1/2, ..., I − 1/2. This greatly simpliﬁes the theory. Denoting 1

section 4). Eq. (2) is usually called the Breit – Rabi formula (see, e.g., Refs. [7, 9–11]). It covers

For H-like ions with I = 1/2, F = 0 and F ′ = 1 and, therefore, the two mixed sublevels have

MF = 0. In this case the Breit – Rabi formula takes the form

It should be noted that in the original paper [7] the lowest-order nonrelativistic expression

If the magnetic ﬁeld is strong, ∆Emag ≫ ∆EHFS, Eqs. (2), (9), and (11) convert into formulas
for the anomalous Zeeman eﬀect of the state with j = 1/2. On the contrary, assuming that the
energy level shift (splitting) due to interaction with ~B is much smaller than the hyperﬁne-structure
splitting, ∆Emag ≪ ∆EHFS, we can express the linear-dependent part of this shift in terms of the
atomic g factor,

transitions into excited nuclear states via the direct interaction of the nucleus with the magnetic

4 Numerical results

In Table 1, we present the numerical results for the functions u−1(αZ), u2(αZ), U(αZ), S(αZ),
and T (αZ) (only for the isotopes with I > 1/2) deﬁned by Eqs. (36), (37), (35), (40), and (43),
respectively. upoint
−1 (αZ), Spoint(αZ), and T point(αZ) are the point-nucleus values obtained by ana-
2 (αZ), U ext(αZ), Sext(αZ), and
lytical formulas (48), (46), and (47), correspondingly. uext
T ext(αZ) are the values calculated for the extended nuclear charge distribution. The root-mean-
square nuclear charge radii hr2i1/2 were taken from Ref. [16]. The calculations were performed
using the dual-kinetic-balance (DKB) basis set method [17] with the basis functions constructed
from B-splines [18,19]. The uncertainties include the diﬀerence between the results obtained with
the Fermi and the homogeneously-charged sphere model for the nuclear charge distribution as well
as the error arising from the uncertainty of hr2i1/2.

−1(αZ), uext

In Table 2, we present the individual contributions to the 1s gj factor for some H-like ions with
I 6= 0 in the range Z = 1 − 20. The error ascribed to the Dirac point-nucleus value results from
the current uncertainty of the ﬁne structure constant, 1/α = 1/137.03599911(46) [20]. The QED
correction includes the one-loop contribution to all orders in αZ [21–23] and the existing αZ-
expansion QED terms of higher orders [24]. The recoil correction to the bound-electron gj factor
incorporates the recoil eﬀect of ﬁrst order in m/M, calculated to all orders in αZ in [25,26], and the
existing αZ-expansion terms of orders (m/M)2 and α(m/M) [27]. The nuclear-size correction was
evaluated for the homogeneously-charged-sphere model. The nuclear polarization contribution to
the 1s gj factor of light H-like ions can be neglected [28]. The gj factor values given in Table 2 are
used for calculations of the coeﬃcients in the Breit – Rabi formula, presented in Tables 3 and 4.
In Table 3, the numerical results for the coeﬃcients in Eqs. (2), (9), (49), and (55) are listed
for some isotopes with I 6= 1/2 in the interval Z = 1 − 20. The numerical values of the coeﬃcients
in Eqs. (9), (11), (55), and (58) for 13C5+ (I = 1/2) are presented in Table 4. Since in all the cases
under consideration the absolute value of the recoil correction to the bound-nucleus gI factor is
smaller than 10−11 [27], we actually have in Eq. (8): g′

I = me

gI.

5 Discussion

The energy separation between the ground-state HFS components (F = I − 1/2 and F ′ = I + 1/2)
of a hydrogenlike ion can be written as [29]

is the relativistic factor, δ(1s) is the nuclear charge distribution correction, ǫ(1s) is the nuclear mag-
netization distribution correction (the Bohr – Weisskopf eﬀect), and x(1s)
rad is the QED correction.
Therefore, the dimensionless variable x = µ0B/∆E(1s)
mec2].
Table 5 shows the value x0 for various B and Z. The intervals of B and Z, for which x ∼ 1,
are of special interest (in the original paper [7] the ﬁelds with 0.1 6 x 6 3 were considered to be
intermediate).

HFS is of order of x0 ≡ µ0B/[α(αZ)3 me
mp

For the magnetic ﬁelds with the magnitude B ∼ 1 − 10 T , that are generally used in this kind
of experiments, H-like ions with Z = 1 − 20 meet the requirement x ∼ 1. For this reason, only
such ions are presented in Tables 2 – 4.

For ions with Z ≤ 20, the electrical quadrupole corrections to the coeﬃcients a1, c1, c2, and d1
are either by a factor 10−3 − 10−4 less than the magnetic dipole ones or equal to zero, if I = 1/2.
As one can see from Tables 3 and 4, the corrections ǫ1, δ1, δ2, δ3, and η1 provide more precise

determinations of the coeﬃcients in the Breit – Rabi formula.

In the second-order approximation (26), formulas (2), (11), (49), and (58) do not contain B to
a power higher than two under the square root (because of h2(F ) = h2(F ′)). For B = 1 − 10 T ,
an estimate of the terms of higher orders with respect to B indicates that the contributions from
these terms are negligibly small as compared with both magnetic dipole and electrical quadrupole
corrections. However, it is very important to take into account ǫ2B2 and η2B2 if Z = 1 − 20. This
is due to the fact that these terms are comparable with the ones appearing from the corrections
to the Breit – Rabi formula coeﬃcients and the less Z is, the more appreciable the contributions
from ǫ2B2 and η2B2 become.

The Breit – Rabi formula for the 1s state contains ∆E(1s)

HFS, and the coeﬃcients in the formula
and the corrections to them calculated above include the value of µ/µN . Therefore, one can
determine both ∆E(1s)

HFS and µ/µN when carrying out the experiments on the Zeeman splitting.

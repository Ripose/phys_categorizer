Li´enard–Wiechert solution revisited

Nikolai V. Mitskievich∗†

Abstract

A self-suﬃcient consideration of the Li´enard–Wiechert solution is
given including its heuristic deduction, which involves a future light
cone (thus with lightlike propagation of information from an arbitrar-
ily moving pointlike charge), and physical interpretation of this ﬁeld
via application of three distinct reference frames (of an inertial ob-
server, then a non-inertial one retardedly co-moving with the charged
source, and ﬁnally, co-moving with the electromagnetic ﬁeld). In the
last frame the magnetic part of the Li´enard–Wiechert ﬁeld identically
(though not asymptotically) vanishes in all spacetime together with
the Poynting vector.
In the second frame, the properties of energy
redistribution and radiation are discussed. The dynamically caused
propagation velocity of the Li´enard–Wiechert electromagnetic ﬁeld in
a vacuum at any ﬁnal distance from the source is less than that of
light.

Key words: Light cone. Propagation of information. Propagation of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. Classiﬁcation of electromagnetic ﬁelds. Transforming
away the magnetic ﬁeld. Reference frame co-moving with the electromag-
netic ﬁeld.

In this paper we consider Maxwellian electromagnetic ﬁelds in the ﬂat Min-
kowski spacetime with the metric tensor gµν = diag(+1,
1), thus
taking Cartesian coordinates (algebraic relations used or deduced here, fre-
quently remain unaltered also in the framework of general relativity). Greek
indices are four- and Latin, three-dimensional. However we more frequently
use as three-dimensional quantities four-dimensional vectors (tensors) orthog-
onal to the timelike unit vector describing the reference frame (the monad).
Diﬀerent frames may be simultaneously applied (the test-object property
which is essential in treatment of reference frames in non-quantum theory).
In general, we do not mutually relate reference frames and systems of coor-
dinates. A comma ( ,) followed by an index is used to denote partial diﬀer-
entiation with respect to the corresponding coordinate. We also use natural
units in which the velocity of light in a vacuum is c = 1. Round brackets
mean symmetrization and square brackets, antisymmetrization in the indices
contained in them (the so-called Bach brackets). In concrete calculations no
approximations are assumed.

This material is essentially the ﬁnal chapter of my unpublished one-
semester course “Relativistic Physics” given to undergraduate (Licenciatura)
students at the Physics Department of the University of Guadalajara during
the last seven years. The students ﬁrst have to attend another course on
tensor calculus which also includes the formalism of Cartan forms with some
applications in physics. The subsection 4.3 was included in my course only
in the last semester.

1.2 Preview of the paper

More than one hundred years ago, A. Li´enard [1] and E. Wiechert [2] dis-
covered an exact solution of Maxwell’s equations describing electromagnetic
ﬁeld of a pointlike electric charge in an arbitrary motion. A frequently used
treatment of this solution can be found in [3], and its more general deduction,
including the use of an arbitrary mixture of retarded and advanced poten-
tials, in [4]. In section 2 we consider a simple and direct deduction of the
Li´enard–Wiechert (below abbreviated as LW) solution with the use of the
light cone concept which involves a supposition of lightlike propagation of

2

information from this pointlike source. Some important general properties
of the LW solution are discussed in section 3. Here a general classiﬁcation of
electromagnetic ﬁelds is outlined, and it is found that the LW ﬁeld belongs to
the pure electric type, thus its magnetic part can be transformed away when
one passes to certain non-inertial reference frames. It is well known that in
a vacuum electromagnetic waves propagate with the fundamental velocity c
(= 1). However, as it is shown in section 4, a mixture of non-radiative and
radiative electromagnetic ﬁelds has another propagation velocity (< 1). For
this reason, when we speak above and in sections 2 and 5 about ‘propagation
of information,’ we do not speak strictly about propagation of electromag-
In subsection 4.3 the general method of
netic ﬁeld in the general sense.
ﬁnding reference frames co-moving with electromagnetic ﬁelds is formulated
(mostly for the case of pure subtypes of electric or magnetic types of ﬁelds via
transformation away of the magnetic or electric ﬁeld, respectively; however
also in the impure subtypes, though there it is impossible to transform away
one or — asymptotically — both ﬁelds E and B, one always may make these
ﬁelds mutually parallel, thus transforming away the Poynting vector in the
respective frame). In frames co-moving with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
Poynting vector automatically vanishes. This method is then applied to the
LW ﬁeld. Relative motion of diﬀerent reference frames is considered in sub-
section 4.4, ﬁrst in general and then for the LW solution. In section 5 some
results obtained in the paper are discussed.
In two appendices, A and B,
a short review of the Ehlers–Zel’manov covariant theory of reference frames
(its algebraic part) is given together with applications to the description of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

2 A systematic deduction of the LW solution

Let us consider a pointlike charge Q in a motion along a worldline L para-
metrically described as

r′ = r′(t′), equivalently, x′i = x′i(t′),

(2.1)

t′ = x′0, i = 1, 2, 3. We shall determine at an arbitrary, but ﬁxed spacetime
point P with coordinates xµ (not on L), the electromagnetic ﬁeld created
by the charge Q being at another point P ′ on L; the coordinates are chosen
to be Cartesian.
It is obvious that the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by a
pointlike charge should have a singularity on L, this is why we exclude here

3

the case of coincidence of the points P and P ′. Note that the coordinates
of P represent four independent scalar variables xµ, and those of P ′ merely
are scalar functions of some parameter (this may be s′, but we shall use the
retarded time t′) along the worldline L, x′µ(t′) (there are three equations, the
fourth being simply an identity, x′0 = t′). To mutually relate the spacetime
points P and P ′, we use a hypothesis that the information about position
and state of motion of the charge propagates with the fundamental velocity
If the
(that of light) in an accordance with the relativistic causality law.
point P and worldline L are given, the point P ′ can be determined as that
of intersection of the past light cone with a vertex at P and the line L (this
simultaneously means that P is on the future light cone with a vertex at P ′).
This constructive deﬁnition is important in the subsequent calculations, but
fortunately the concrete relation between the position of P and the corre-
sponding retarded time t′ at P ′ turns out to be of no importance. Thus t′ is
a function of all four coordinates of P — we write it as t′(x); we shall easily
calculate the explicit form of derivatives of t′ with respect to the coordinates
xµ without an explicit knowledge of t′(x).

We take the Minkowski metric as gµν = gµν = diag(+1,

1) (in
fact, this is the deﬁnition of Cartesian coordinates), thus the tangent vector
to L, u′µ = dx′µ/ds′ (the four-velocity of the charge) taken at the retarded
u′
point P ′, is timelike and unitary (u′
µ = 1), its timelike property

being manifested by the relation ds′2 > 0 along L. Locally, u′ determines the
direction of growth of the proper time s′, being simultaneously the projector
onto the (retarded) physical time direction of the (retarded) reference frame
(retardedly) co-moving with the charge. Another projector, now a tensor,
can be constructed as (A.2), here

reader, beginning with (A.8), may easily reconstruct the corresponding for-
mulae and apply them to interpretation of the results and to make a com-
parison with the treatment of LW problem in [3]. The ﬁnal step in this part

The well-known Coulomb potential in a vacuum in electrostatics can be writ-
ten as Aµ = Q

notices that the four-velocity of the charge at rest is u′µ = uµ = δµ
0 . This
potential exactly satisﬁes both equations of (2.19) when r
= 0. We shall
now show that a simple generalization of the Coulomb potential is also an
exact solution of Maxwell’s equations, and this is precisely that of Li´enard–
Wiechert.

The generalization is simply

3 General properties of the LW ﬁeld

First it is worth mentioning the obvious fact that the Coulomb ﬁeld is a
special case of the LW solution: one simply has to consider a pointlike charge
at rest, that is u′µ = δµ
0 for any P ′, thus a′µ = 0. This is the reason why the
LW solution has to be interpreted as the electromagnetic ﬁeld of an arbitrarily
moving pointlike charge (of course, the Gauss theorem is here also applicable,
for example, in an inertial frame instantaneously co-moving with the central
charge at P ′).

3.1 Classiﬁcation of electromagnetic ﬁelds and its ap-

plication to the LW solution

The classiﬁcation of electromagnetic ﬁelds is based on existence of only two
invariants built with the ﬁeld tensor Fµν, while all other invariants are merely
algebraic functions of these two (if not vanish identically). The ﬁrst invariant
is I1 = FµνF µν = 2(B2
B, cf.
•
(B.2) and (B.3); the deﬁnition of I2 contains dual conjugation of Fµν,

E2), and the second, I2 = F ∗µν F µν = 4E

I2 is really invariant, and I2 itself is a pseudo-invariant which acquires the
factor J/
by a general transformation of coordinates, J being the Jacobian
of the transformation, thus the concrete sign of I2 does not matter. In terms
of I1 the invariant classiﬁcation suggests three types of ﬁelds: I1 < 0 is the
electric type (the electric ﬁeld dominates), I1 > 0 gives the magnetic type,
and to I1 = 0 corresponds the null type. On the pseudo-invariant I2 the
further working out in detail of the classiﬁcation is based: the additional
= 0) and pure (I2 = 0). It is important that the
subtypes are impure (I2 6
pure electric case permits (at least, locally, if one considers only inertial
frames) to completely eliminate the magnetic ﬁeld, and similarly, the pure
magnetic ﬁeld permits to completely eliminate the electric ﬁeld, while the
pure null electromagnetic ﬁeld in a vacuum permits to ﬁnd a coordinate
system (reference frame) in which the electric and magnetic ﬁeld intensities
would take any desired ﬁnite (nonzero and non-inﬁnite) and equal values, but,
of course, the ﬁeld will continue to pertain to the same pure null type (in
this case, both ﬁelds E and B will be ever equal in their absolute values and
mutually orthogonal, as can be seen from the structure of both invariants).
This last property is closely related to the Doppler eﬀect (not only in the sense
of the frequency, but — and more profoundly — also of the ﬁeld intensity),
in particular, a complete elimination of the pure null type ﬁeld is ‘possible’
only asymptotically (in less rich-in-content terms, this means ‘impossible’),
since there cannot exist any reference frame moving with the speed of light
with respect to an arbitrary permissible reference frame. The impure electric,
magnetic, and null types obviously do not permit such manipulations with
the three-dimensional parts E and B of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (in the
impure electric and magnetic cases it is impossible to transform away the
counterparts of these respective ﬁelds).

Let us now apply this classiﬁcation to the LW electromagnetic ﬁeld. Since
0 for any simple bivector (2.23), even with arbitrary

I2 = 1
R and U, the ﬁeld is pure. Then it is pure electric since

2ǫµναβF µνF αβ

≡

I1 =

D4 < 0

−

(3.2)

(remarkably, the structure of I1 is exactly Coulombian). This means that
at any point of the spacetime (any ﬁnite value of the distance D, i.e. not
asymptotically) it is possible to transform away the magnetic part of the
ﬁeld; moreover, it is possible to ﬁnd such a global reference frame in which
only electric part of the ﬁeld will be present. This possibility can be globally

9

In
realized for any concrete choice of the motion of the pointlike charge.
these speciﬁc reference frames which are in general non-inertial, but naturally
admissible in special relativity (like those to which we are accustomed in non-
relativistic physics, the area much more restricted than special relativity),
the Poynting vector of the LW ﬁeld will vanish globally. This fact will be
discussed in more concrete details below. Its physical meaning is that at any
ﬁnite point of the spacetime the electromagnetic LW ﬁeld propagates with
sub-luminal velocity.

4 Propagation of the LW electromagnetic ﬁeld

4.1 Viewpoint of an inertial observer

This is the least interesting case of the reference frame application to LW
solution while the approach reduces to use of a monad adapted to Cartesian
coordinates. Let the inertial observer at P measure electric and magnetic
ﬁelds E and B as well as electromagnetic energy density w and Poynting
vector S which are two of the three decomposition parts of (B.7) (we shall
not consider the stress tensor) with respect to this observer’s monad τ µ = δµ

(4.4)

However, since the Poynting vector expression is nonlinear in characteristics
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (due to multiplication of electric and magnetic
vectors), we prefer our consideration given in the next subsection to that
which splits (4.4) in two parts one of which should describe the outgoing
radiation; this reasoning works only asymptotically, and the expression (4.3)
is in this case more transparent than (4.4) due to the factor D in the corre-
sponding term in square brackets in (4.3).

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the diﬀerential characteristics of any
inertial frame (its acceleration, rotation, and rate-of-strain tensor), including
the frame considered above, identically vanish, thus of course simplifying the
considerations given in [3], though at the cost of omission of some important
details.

4.2 The retarded reference frame co-moving with the

charge

The retarded reference frame at P co-moving with the charge at P ′ is de-
termined by the monad τ µ = u′µ. Thus for electric and magnetic ﬁelds we
have

This expression however takes more transparent form if we also use the pro-

(4.8)

This remarkably simple expression of the LW energy ﬂux suggests the
following two conclusions. First, the part proportional to 1/D3 and linear in
the retarded four-acceleration a′, is perpendicular to the radial direction n
(i.e., it is restricted to the corresponding two-sphere on the future light cone
with its vertex at P ′). Thus it describes a redistribution of energy at the ﬁxed
retarded distance D from the ﬁeld source. The integral redistribution ﬂux be-
comes smaller with more distant location of the observer and asymptotically
(D
) tends to zero due to multiplication of (4.8) by the two-dimensional
D2), while the integration is performed only
surface element of the sphere (
in the sense of angular coordinates on the sphere. Of course, the very surface
(if taken not on the light cone), as well as the reference frame’s three-space,
is non-holonom since in general this frame possesses rotation

see (A.9), (A.5), (2.11), and the ﬁnal remarks in appendix A. Second, the
part proportional to 1/D2 has positive radial direction (take into account
that it gives exactly this contribution since four-dimensional square of the
spacelike vector a′ is negative due to the space-time signature). Thus it
describes an energy ﬂux from the charge to spatial inﬁnity. Moreover, all this
part of energy really goes to inﬁnity without being accumulated or rareﬁed at
any values of D. Hence this term really describes radiation of energy by the
accelerated charge. The non-holonomicity remark is here also relevant, and
in this situation one has to take certain caution; this is why we mentioned
a roundabout approach involving the light cone which always exists and
represents a real hypersurface, though its normal vector is null, thus at the
same time it is on the light cone itself. This problem goes beyond the bounds
of our paper, and we only mention here that it was successfully treated in
last few decades in general relativity. After all, we are living and working in
the rotating reference frame of our planet, therefore our three-dimensional
physical space certainly is non-holonom, but this does not prevent us to do
physics and to apply it quite well.

In the retarded co-moving reference frame of the pointlike charge the LW
electromagnetic energy ﬂux has no other constituent parts. Since the problem
does not take into account the sources of acceleration of the charge (the lack
of a strict auto-consistency of the problem), the energy ﬂux does not result
here in any change of the state of motion of charge. One may say that there
is implicitly some kind of engine which prescribes the exact world line of the
charged particle (the LW problem does not involve any information about
the particle’s mass and energy), thus this “engine” automatically “takes into
account” the particle’s energy loss due to radiation (which at ﬁnite distances
is not ligtlike, see below). Other details follow from the further consideration
of a new reference frame in which the magnetic ﬁeld of the LW solution
simply vanishes.

4.3 LW solution in the reference frame co-moving with
electromagnetic ﬁeld, but not with the charge

In a reference frame which is co-moving with electromagnetic ﬁeld, the Poynt-
ing vector should vanish. This can occur for two alternative reasons (to be
realized in this frame): either electric and magnetic vectors are mutually
parallel (this is the impure classiﬁcation subcase), or one of them is equal to

13

zero (the pure subcase). The ﬁrst case was considered by Wheeler [7] toward
other ends. The second case pertains naturally to the LW ﬁeld since this
is a pure electric one (thus Wheeler’s approach is not applicable, and the
magnetic part can be transformed away via a proper choice of the reference
frame). In fact, this possibility is scarcely encountered in literature (I even
don’t know any references), and it would be interesting to investigate it in
more detail. We shall see that this task is much simpler than one could
expect.

Remember the general form of the LW ﬁeld tensor, (2.23): Fµν = RµUν −
V = U + kR where k

UµRν. Let us (algebraically) regauge the vector U
is a scalar function. This does not change the ﬁeld tensor,

→

Fµν = RµVν −

VµRν.

(4.10)

Applying now the 1-form deﬁnition of the magnetic vector in a τ -frame (B.3)
and taking the monad as τ = NV where the scalar normalization factor is
V )−1/2, we obviously come to B= 0 in this frame. The problem
N = (V
is thus reduced to a proper choice of k such that V will be a suitable real
timelike vector with V
V > 0. This method should work in our case (for
a pure magnetic ﬁeld, a similar technique can be applied, though requiring
automatic representation of

F as a simple bivector).

4.4 Relative three-velocities of reference frames

Let us now simultaneously consider three distinct reference frames and denote
them as A, B, and C. Between such frames there can be established quite
a few algebraic relations having a clear and important physical meaning,
and it is interesting that these relations hold equally in general and special

15

relativity. One deﬁnes the relative three-velocity of frame B with respect
to frame A (and measured in A) as a (co)vector vBA perpendicular to the
monad τA. According to (A.6),

It is clear that similar relations exist for any pair of reference frames what-
ever when the respective monads are introduced. We see that there is a
symmetry for squared three-velocities between any pair of frames, in partic-
ular, v2
AB. Since these three-velocities are described as four-vectors
perpendicular to the respective monads (of the frames corresponding to the
frame subindex of τ and of b), they belong to diﬀerent (local) three-spatial
sections of spacetime and in general cannot be directly compared by mea-
surements ones with others without further projections onto alternative sub-
spaces. The inevitability of such a situation is quite obvious. Even in the gen-
erally used special-relativistic composition-of-velocities formula for globally
inertial frames in motion along “same spatial direction,” this is in fact also
the case which is tacitly assumed, but frequently not properly understood.
Its strict formulation when these velocities are not mutually “parallel,” is
however more laborious.

Another useful step in our calculations is to apply same procedure as
in (4.19), but taken with respect to the frames C and A, then to C and
B, and further applying it to the free τB, thus τC = (τA + vCA)(τA
τC) =
(τB + vCB)(τB
τC). When this expression
is multiplied by bA under a contraction with the lower (component) index of
this factor, we come to

worth giving some hints for the deduction of (4.27): The exterior product of
any odd-rank forms α and β is skew-symmetric, thus α
0. The vector
product (A.5) is applicable to a pair of arbitrary vectors, thus it automatically
projects each of them onto the three-dimensional subspace orthogonal to the
monad. One now has to apply the deﬁnition of rotation (A.9) to the monad ˆτ .
Some simpliﬁcations follow immediately. Then to complete the simpliﬁcation
one has to take into account a relation following from the form (not directly

5 Concluding remarks

We tried to give in this paper a self-suﬃcient consideration of the LW solu-
tion, from its heuristic deduction to an analysis of important properties of the
obtained ﬁeld. One of these properties is that of ﬁeld’s motion with respect
to a given reference frame. In fact, one can relate this motion to the monad
describing the frame in which the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not propagate
(its Poynting vector, the electromagnetic energy ﬂux density, vanishes in this
frame). It is possible to ﬁnd such a frame in all cases with the exception
of pure null electromagnetic ﬁelds:
in this latter case both electromagnetic
invariants are equal to zero, consequently there remains only an asymptotic
possibility to transform away the ﬁeld’s motion, but then it is transformed
away always together with the ﬁeld itself (this is precisely the asymptotic
limit of the Doppler eﬀect). This asymptotic situation does not belong to
any admissible reference frame or system of coordinates since such a frame
(or, of one wishes, a system) is a degenerate one and thus excluded from con-
sideration (whose region of application is an open one, and the ‘boundary’ is
excluded from it, though we can approach it as ‘near’ as we wish, making the
non-zero ﬁeld as weak as we choose it to become). In this pure null case (the
deﬁnition see in section 3.1) the ﬁeld by itself exercises lightlike (null) mo-
tion, that with the velocity of light. But then there cannot exist a co-moving
(with this ﬁeld) reference frame since its four-velocity should coincide with
the monad of the co-moving frame, and the monad vector is timelike by its
deﬁnition. (More physical reasons are related to the fact that the continu-
ous swarm of observers forming, together with their measuring equipment,
a reference frame, and thus being co-moving with it, should always possess
non-zero rest masses, though, of course, these masses have to be inﬁnitesi-
mal ones to guarantee the test property of a classical frame of reference. The
non-zero rest mass means a timelike worldline of the corresponding object,
thus the lightlike motion of any reference frame is physically impossible.) In
all other cases concerning electromagnetic ﬁelds’ types a co-moving frame is
easily realizable (in this paper we discussed the pure electric and pure mag-
netic types, and all impure subcases should be dealt with according to the
method used by Rainich and Wheeler, see [7]).

Another property is also related to propagation, however not of the ﬁeld
but of the information about its sources, thus this property belongs to the
deduction of the LW ﬁeld. This is a rare case when we encounter in a classical
physical context the concept of information usually alien to it. And here

18

information propagates with the velocity of light in a vacuum.

Appendices

A Description of reference frames

In this paper we use notations and deﬁnitions from [8], see also references
therein. A reference frame is understood as the splitting of general four-
dimensional physical quantities into parts referred to observer’s local time
direction and the corresponding local three-dimensional physical subspace
orthogonal to it, however the latter (or both parts) are written as four-
dimensional tensor quantities (of naturally determined ranks) being orthog-
onal (or also, if we would wish to emphasize this geometrically, parallel) to
observer’s time direction. This direction is expressed via the unit vector
(or covector, the distinction should be understandable from the context, fre-
quently mathematical) τ , the monad, tangent to the observer’s world line,
thus interpreted as the observer’s four-velocity at the event (four-dimensional
point) where is located the quantity (object) under consideration. Thus we
speak about a continuous swarm of observers, a congruence of their world
lines without singularities (the lines do not intersect, and through any event
goes one and only one such line). The monad and the metric tensor at each
event are necessary and suﬃcient for a complete description of a reference
frame. Of course, this presence of a swarm of observers, with all their equip-
ment necessary for measuring of all physical quantities at any event, should
not disturb both usual physical ﬁelds and (in general relativity) the spacetime
geometry (the gravitational ﬁeld). Here we consider such arbitrary reference
frames only in the framework of special relativity, thus the simplest choice
of coordinates is Cartesian which we use in this paper.
In our treatment
reference frames are generally not related to systems of coordinates, and in
one and the same system of coordinates any choice of a reference frame (or
diﬀerent choices simultaneously) may be used.

To split spacetime tensors into their above-mentioned parts, two typical
projectors are used. A projector is an idempotent, which means that its
repeated action automatically reduces to a single action of it, and it diﬀers
from the metric tensor possessing a similar (just mentioned) property by
the fact that an application of a projector leads to certain partial loss of
4 matrix (really, a rank two
information. If we describe a projector as a 4

×

19

tensor), its determinant should be equal to zero. In more concrete terms,
the matrix rank of a projector should be equal to one when we speak about
a projector onto a single direction (here, τ ), or three when we perform a
projection onto the local three-dimensional physical space orthogonal to τ .
Thus in the ﬁrst case we can use the projector

Traditionally, in the literature one usually ﬁnds an implicit identiﬁcation
of a four-dimensional Cartesian system of coordinates and the corresponding
(“co-moving”) reference frame. This does not pose any ambiguities, only
if diﬀerent reference frames are not considered simultaneously on the back-
ground of same system of coordinates, or a non-inertial reference frame is
involved. However it is better to take into account that this traditional
approach represents a tacit admission that the monad coincides with the
unit (timelike) vector along the t-axis and any orthonormal transformation
is accompanied with a corresponding change of the monad. There is also
a widespread prejudice that non-inertial frames cannot be used in or they
contradict to the special theory of relativity, but this is nothing more than a
prejudice. In this paper we consider such frames of non-inertial observers in
two concrete cases, and the monad approach works perfectly in description of
physical situation in these non-inertial frames. We also use another projec-
tor (of rank-two matrix, that is, realizing projection onto a two-dimensional
subspace) when it simpliﬁes description of the situation, and there should
exist a naturally determined spatial direction which enables this description.
It is convenient, in the sense of both calculations and adequate work of
physical intuition, to use the vector symbolics of scalar and vector products

well’s equations in tensor form in a vacuum and without sources. Its (single)
contraction with arbitrary monad includes the Poynting vector in that frame,

(it is interesting that this expression is not only a scalar under transforma-
tions of coordinates, but it is also independent of the choice of reference
frame: the right-hand side does not involve any mention of the monad at
all). For the LW ﬁeld [due to (3.2)] this takes a very concise form,

2This edition was not translated into English, though it is the best and most complete
version of all Russian editions of this book. We use some notations accepted in it, but our
deduction of the LW solution and its treatment are diﬀerent from those given by Landau
and Lifshitz.

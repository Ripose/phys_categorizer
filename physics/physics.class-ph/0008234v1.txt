Abstract

The violation of the invariance of the speed of light in Special Relativity has been
made. The version of the theory has been constructed in which the possibility of the
superluminal motions are permitted.

1 Introduction

In view of mathematical elegance, laconicalness and predictive power Special Relativity (SR)
is the fundamental theory of modern physics. Owing to this the mathematical postulates
of the theory, possibility of their modiﬁcation and generalization as well as of experimental
test attract attention constantly. As examples one can be presented the well known Pauli
monograph [1], containing the elements of the Abraham and Ritz theories; academician
Logunov’s lectures on the foundations of Relativity Theory with the formulation of SR in
the aﬃne space [2]; Fushchich’s publication on the non-linear electrodynamics equations with
the non-invariant speed of light [3]; Glashow’s work on the experimental consequences of the
violation of the Lorentz-invariance in astrophysics [4].

To the present time SR is one of the most experimentally-justiﬁed theories (for example,
Pauli and Landsberg monographies [1, 5]; Strakhovsky and Uspensky [6], Basov and his co-
authors [7], Møller [8] and Molchanov [9] reviews; the original publications of [10, 11, 12]).
Here one can mention the experiments on detection of the ether wind in the experiments of
the Michelson type [1, 5]; determination of the angular light aberrations [1, 5]; transversal
Doppler eﬀect measurement [10]; experiments on the proof of independence of the speed
of light from the velocity of the source of light [9, 10]; experiments on determination of
the relativistic mass dependence of the velocity of a particle motion [10]; the relativistic
retardation of time [10]; the g-2 experiments [11, 12, 10]. The results of these experiments
indicate the absence of the ether wind to closer and closer limits of accuracy, and argue for
SR.

This raises the natural question, whether do exist at all any experiments diﬀerent from
SR predictions, even though they are ambiguously interpreted. It appears that there are
a number of the publications on this theme. Let us consider those concerning the second
postulate - the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light.

Giannetto, Maccarrone, Mignani and Recami [13] have been considered the possibility of
the negative sign interpretation of the square of the neutrino 4 - momentum P 2 = E 2−p2c2 =
2c4 = (−0, 166± 0, 091) MeV 2 in the experiments on π - decay π+ → µ+ + ν as the fact of
M0
observation of a superluminal particle with imaging mass M0 = im (tachyon). Khalﬁn [14]
has established that negative sign of the square of the neutrino 4-momentum may be due to
incorrectness of the observational data processing near upper bound of β - spectrum (in our
own case near a upper bound of µ - spectrum). Thus, the possibility of the interpretation

1

of π- neutrino as a particle of the tachyon nature is eliminated practically in the light of the
contemporary explanation for the negative sign of the 4-momentum square.

Mamaev [15] has analyzed the time-ﬂight spectra of π−, µ−, e− particles from Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna) and concluded that the data from the article [16]
may be interpreted as the result of superluminal motion of mesons and electrons. However,
taking into account the presence in the signal processing electronic circuit of a threshold
device (discriminator) with 2543 channels of the analyzer, it is possible to conclude that the
velocities of these particles were 0, 92c, 0, 94c and 0, 96c respectively, where c is the speed of
light. The phenomenon of superluminal motion disappears, and mutual arrangement of the
spectral lines from [16] may be explained in the framework of SR [26].

Nevertheless numerous examples are known in which the elimination of superluminal
motion turns out to be more diﬃcult and less convincing than in the considered cases.
These are observations of superluminal motion of particles in broad atmospheric showers
and the acts of antiproton birth, as well as on expansion of the shells of some extragalactic
radiosources, for example [17, 12, 19].

Clay and Crouch has observed [17] impulses, preceding the signal induced by a broad
atmospheric shower. Let us suppose that particles from the shower had the velocity equal to
the speed of light (that is natural). Then it is not clear, what has preceded these particles.
”We conclude that we have observed non-random events preceding the arrival of an extensive
air shower. Being unable to explain this result in a more conventional manner, we suggest
that is the result of a particle traveling with an apparent velocity greater than of light ” [17].
Further the authors [17] have assumed that the impulses were stipulated by the particles
with imaginary masses (tachyons) traveling at the velocities exceeding the speed of light.

Cooper [12] has concluded that the time-ﬂight experiments on observation of antiprotons
admit the existence of superluminal particles (antimesons) connected with antiprotons. The
calculated probability of the velocity of antimesons exceeding the speed of light, is equal
0.9972. The evaluation turn out to be tolerant to various experimental errors. The author
writes: ” A reexamination of the Nobel-prize-winning experiment in which the antiproton
was discovered reveals that associated antimesons might be traveling faster than light ” [12].
The numerous publications are known on the observation of superluminal expansion
of extragalactic radiosources (for example [19, 20, 26]).
It is an interesting phenomenon,
and it is diﬃcult to be explained in terms of modern astrophysics. The observation of
the superluminal expansion became possible after the radio interferometers VLBI (Very
Long Baseline Interferometry) for the centimetre spectral range were created. These possess
a superlong trans-continental base L (thousands and tens of thousands kilometers). The
angular resolution of such telescopes δ ∼ λ/L is proportional to the ratio of a working
wavelength λ to the value of the base L. It is much higher than the one of the best optical
devices. In the optical range L/λ is equal ∼ 6 · 107, while in the radio range it is equal ∼
18· 108. The radio interferometers allow one to study such thin structure of space objects (∼
7· 10−4 angle seconds) as was inaccessible to be observed by optical means. The studies have
shown that many extragalactic radio sources have a complicated, bi-component structure.
Among of them the substructure of six radio sources run away from each other at calculated
velocities that are some times more than the speed of light. It is the radio galaxy 3C120
(z = 0.033), quasars 3C273 (z = 0.158), 3C279 (z = 0.538), 3C345 (z = 0.595), 3C179
(z = 0.846) and NRAO140 (z = 1.258) [21]. (Here z is the parameter of redshift). The

2

transversal velocities calculated within the framework of the cosmological Friedmann model
of the motion of the components are equal V⊥ ∼ (2 − 20)c. It has been proposed over ten
versions for interpretations of this phenomenon. It may be associated with more complicated
multicomponent structure of the quasars; the random superposition of radio spots on the
quasars; inﬂuence of intergalactic gravitational lens duplicating a visible image; Doppler
eﬀect; increase of Hubble’s constant that is accompanied by decreasing the distances to the
quasars, which results in disappearing the superluminal expansion. Also, it may be due
to the inﬂuence of interstellar magnetic ﬁelds; existence of tachyon matter; introduction of
5-space with an additional ﬁfth coordinate such as the speed of light running the values from
0 to ∞; model of the light echo; optical illusion not contradicting to SR [19, 20, 26]. It is
evident that the conventional explanation for the superluminal expansion is not oﬀered yet,
and various hypothesizes on the nature of this phenomenon may be discussed.

Loiseau [22] has paid attention to the little diﬀerence between the galaxy NGC 5668
redshift z′, measured by radioastronomical method at the frequency corresponding to the
wavelength 21 cm, and the redshift z, measured in the optical range for this galaxy. This
result, if it really is outside the limits of measurement errors, cannot be explained in the
framework of SR, as z′ = z should be with c′ = c. To explain this result, author [22] in-
troduced 3-dimensional non-Euclidean space, inserted into 4-dimensional Riemannian space
with some common time.
In this case it may be obtained that the galaxy speed of light
c′ and the speed of light c on the Earth are connected by the ratio c′ = c(1 + z)/(1 + z′),
where z is the redshift on a wave length in the optical range, and z′ is the redshift on a
wave frequency in the radio range.
In accordance with the observed data on the galaxy
NGC 5668 z is equal to 0.00580 in the optical range; z′ is equal to 0.00526 in the radio
range on the frequency corresponding to the wavelength 21 cm. It follows from here that
c′/c = (1 + z)/(1 + z′) = 1.00580/1.00526 = 1.0005372, and c′ = c + 182, 04 km / sec ¿ c
[22]. The estimation has shown that the speed of light from quasar QSO PKS 2134 with the
optical redshift z = 1.936 is equal to c′ = 440.000 km / sec [22]. The relationship between c′,

c and the quasar velocity v relative to the Earth is described by the formula c′ = cq1 + v2/c2

in the approximation of a weak gravitational ﬁeld. The statistical signiﬁcance of the hypoth-
esis on the diﬀerence between the redshifts in the radio and optical ranges is naturally the
deciding factor for the Loiseau work.

Thus, unambiguously interpreted experimental data distinct from SR predictions are
apparently absent now. But there are vague indications that it is not improbable that they
exist in particle physics and in astrophysics. Let us consider the hypothesis on the existence
of the superluminal motion in terms of the violation of invariance of the speed of light in the
expression for the second degree of 4-interval at the inﬁnitesimal level.

2 Space - Time Metric, Diﬀerentials Coordinates

Transformation Law

Let us start from the condition for the invariance of the 4 - interval diﬀerential in Minkowski

3

space with the metric:

′)2 =
ds2 = −(dx1
−(dx1)2 − (dx2)2 − (dx3)2 − (dx4)2 − inv.

′)2 − (dx4

′)2 − (dx3

′)2 − (dx2

(1)

Here dx1,2,3 = (dx, dy, dz), dx4 = icdt, it is not necessary for the speed of light c′ to be
equal c. Corresponding inﬁnitesimal space - time transformations, saving the invariance of
the form (1), obviously contain the group locally isomorphic to the Lorentz group [23]:

dx′

a = dxa, dx′

a = Labdxb, a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4,

(2)

where Lab is the matrix of the six-dimensional Lorentz group L6 [23] with local kinematics
parameter β. The one-dimensional inﬁnitesimal transformations corresponding to the given
matrix, take the well known form:

dx′

1 =

dx1 + iβdx4

√1 − β 2

dx4 − iβdx1
√1 − β 2

; dx′

4 =

; dx′

2 = dx2; dx′

3 = dx3

(3)

The reciprocal transformations may be obtained by the prime permutation. The group
parameters are connected by the ratio β ′ = −β [23]. But contrary to the global Lorentz
transformations [23], here the parameters β and β ′ can depend explicitly or implicitly on a
space - time point β = β(f (x, t)), β ′ = β ′(f ′(x′, t′)). This is the important circumstance
which will allow one to construct the theoretical model in which the existence of superluminal
motion is possible. The integral space - time transformations induced by (3) are:

x′

1 = Z dx1 + iβdx4

√1 − β 2 + d1; x′

4 = Z dx4 − iβdx1

√1 − β 2 + d4;

2 = x2 + d2; x′
x′

3 = x3 + d3,

(4)

where d1 − d4 are the translation parameters; the reciprocal transformations may be ob-
tained by the prime permutation; d′
a = −da, a = 1, 2, 3, 4. The transformations (4) go into
the Poincar´e ones if c = cost, c′ = c be put into them and our consideration be restricted to
inertial motions (β = const). In this case on integration they go into the standard transforma-
tions from Poincar´e group (inhomogeneous Lorentz group). Thus, Lorentz transformations
are contained here as the particular case. The group properties of the integral transforma-
tions (4) are realized due to the group properties of the diﬀerential transformations (3) and
due to the relativistic velocity addition theorem β” = (β + β ′)/(1 + ββ ′).

3 Integral of Operation, Energy, Momentum

Let us turn to the integral of operation in SR [23]. It is not invariant with respect to the
transformations with broken invariance of the speed of light. However this property may be
corrected if we start from the invariant integral of operation [26]:

S ∗ = cS = −mc2Z ds + eZ Aadxa +

16π Z Fab

2d4x =

−mc2Z ds − iZ Aajad4x +

2d4x =

16π Z Fab
8π Z (E 2 − H 2)d3x(cdt).

(5)

Here S ∗ is the new integral of operation, which we name the generalized one; mc2 is the
invariant combination corresponding to the rest energy of a particle (m is the rest-mass, c is
the speed of light); e is the invariant electrical charge of a particle; Aa = (A1, A2, A3, A4) =
(A, iφ) is the 4-potential [23]; ja = (j1, j2, j3, j4) = (ρv/c, iρ) is the 4-vector of current
density [1] instead of ja = (ρv, icρ) [23], ρ is the charge density, v is the velocity of a charge;
Fab = ∂Ab/∂xa − ∂Aa/∂xb is the tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld; E = −(1/c)∂A/∂t − ∇φ is
2 = 2(H 2 − E 2); d4x = dx1dx2dx3dx4
the electrical ﬁeld; H = ∇XA is the magnetic ﬁeld; Fab
is the element of the invariant 4-volume [23].
The transformational rest-mass properties is changed as the result from the introduction
of the generalized integral (5). The mass is not any more scalar. The mass is transformed
according to the law m′ = (c2/c′2)m = γ−2m. The rest energy mc2 has a scalar property.
The transformational property of Plank constant ¯h is changed as well. The invariant is not
the constant ¯h, but the product ¯hc. Due to the electrical charge property of invariance e,
the thin structure constant remains invariant α = e2/¯hc - inv.

The generalized Lagrangian, energy and 4 - momentum of a particle correspond to the
generalized integral of operation. We will label the generalized values with the symbol *.
We have:

mc2

P∗ =

L∗ = cL = −mc2q1 − β 2 + eA · β − eφ;
√1 − β 2 + eA = cp + eA;
√1 − β 2 + eφ = E.

E ∗ = P∗ · β − cL =

It follows from here that the motion integrals are the energy E and the product of the
speed of light by the momentum from SR: cP = cp + eA. The parameter β has meaning
as generalized velocity. The diﬀerential dx0 = cdt plays a role of the time diﬀerential. It
is essential that thanks to the diﬀerentiation with respect to the parameter β, the results
obtained do not depend on the particular assumptions concerning the properties of the speed
of light, as the value c enters into the parameter β = v/c.

Owing to the well known property of 4 - speed U 2 = −1, we have the following expression

for the generalized 4 - momentum pa

∗ = mc2ua of a free particle:

∗2 = c2p2 − E 2 = −m2c4 − inv.
As in [23], in case of a particle in electromagnetic ﬁeld we ﬁnd:

4 Equations of Motion for Charged Particle

Keeping in the mind expression (6), we shall start from Lagrange equations d(∂L∗/∂β)/dx0−
∂L∗/∂x = 0 taking into account the vector equality ∇(a·b) = (a·∇)b+(b·∇)a+ax(∇xb)+

Let us start from the permutational ratios of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor and the
ﬁeld Lagrange equations ∂(∂L∗/∂Aa,b)/∂xb − ∂L∗/∂Aa = 0 [23, 24] taking into account
ab/∂Aa,b = 4Fab [23] and the density of the Lagrange function L∗ =
the expression ∂F 2
2. Here Aa(x) is 4-potential; Aa,b = ∂Aa/∂xb; a, b = 1, 2, 3, 4;

(14)

Out of them the equation of motion (13) and the equations of electromagnetic ﬁeld (14)
coincide with the equations which are known from SR.

Let us note that according to the given scheme Maxwell equations turn out to be invariant
not only in inertial frames (it is well known), but also in non-inertial frames in the ﬂat pseudo
- Euclidean space with the metric ds2 = c2dt2 − dx2. This property of Maxwell equations
seems to be unusual, but it is known and has been noted by academician Logunov: ”... in
the framework of SR it is possible to describe a physical phenomena in non-inertial frames
as well. Fock understood this deeply ... ” [2]. The statement follows also from the general
covariant formulation of Maxwell equations [2, 23, 26].

6 Local SR

Up to this point any constraint did not placed on the transformation properties of the
It turns out that it is possible to realize various theoretical

In particular, if we postulate that c′ = c, all

constant and c′
6= c, c′t′ = ct - inv, the model may be realized which we name SR with
non-invariant speed of light [26].
It describes the same physical reality as SR and also
contains additional classiﬁcation capabilities due to the symmetry with respect to more
general group of transformations. Besides Poincar´e group, this group includes the group
induced by the generators X−1 = ∂t − t∂t/c, X0 = c∂c − t∂t, X+1 = c2∂c − ct∂t [26]. At last,
the postulation is possible which permits one to construct a version of the theory compatible
with the principle of relativity and the concept of superluminal motion. Let us consider this
capability at length.

6

According to Ritz [1] we assume that the speed of light is equal to co = 3·1010 cm/sec not
in global meaning, but only relatively to an emitter. Let us add a new physical element to
the inﬁnitesimal transformations (2) and the model based on them with equations of motion
(12), (13), ( 14). We assume that the state of motion (inertial, or non-inertial) does not
inﬂuences on the proper value of the speed of light c0, Plank constant ¯h0, the thin structure
constant α and other physical proper values, for example, the proper length l0, proper time
t0, proper frequency of oscillations ω0, rest-mass m0, electrical charge e. (A proper value is
the physical value in the frame K0 relatively to which the object is immobile). These remain
invariant in the process of motion:

c′
0 = c0 = co = 3 · 1010cm/sec;
¯h′
0 = ¯h0 = 1, 0 · 10−27g · cm2/sec;

′

0 = l0; t′

0 = t0; ω′

0 = ω; m′

0 = m0; e′ = e.

(15)

The hypothesis on the independence of proper values of physical quantities from the state
of a physical object motion we agree to name the local relativity principle.

Let us assume further that the time intervals measured by means of diﬀerently-placed
clocks in any frames K, K ′, · · · coincide with the local time in a proper frame Ko on the
trajectory of the motion of the object:

dto = dt = dt′.

(16)

We agree to name the theoretical model, realizing the local relativity principle in the
ﬂat space - time with the metric (1) in combination with the hypothetical property of time
(16), as Local Special Relativity Theory (LSR) as distinct from the classical SR. We ﬁnd
the following expressions for inﬁnitesimal space - time transformations in this case:

dx =

dxo − vodto

where v/c = −vo/co; (1 − v2/c2) · (1 + v2/co
2) = 1. In this case the following relationship
between the speed of light c and the velocity of emitter v is hold true as the result from the
transformation properties of the speed of light in the formulae ( 17):

c = cos1 +

v2
2 .
co

(18)

Here co is the speed of light in the proper frame associated with the emitter. (In the models
admitting the existence of ether co is the speed of light relatively to ether). The expressions
for the speed of light in the form of (17) or (18) were obtained by Abraham (1910) [1] and

7

Rapier (1961) [25] respectively in the framework of ether models; next they were obtained by
the author of the present publication (1968) [26] and Loiseau (1968) [22] in the framework
of the relativity principle. These formulae were reproduced further by many authors from
various points of view, in particular by Marinov (1975) [27], by Hsu (1976) [28], by Sj¨odin
(1977) [29], by Mamaev (1985) [15], by Nimbuev (1996) [30], by Klimez (1997) [31], by Russo
(1998) [32].

6.1 Generalized Momentum and Energy

Let us put the expression for the speed of light (18) into the formulae for momentum (7)
and energy (8) of a free particle. We have:

p∗ = cp =

= m0c0v;

cmv

q1 − v2/c2

mc2

= m0c0

E =

q1 − v2/c2

2q1 + v2/c0

2 = m0c0c.

(19)

The relation has a view between the generalized momentum and energy by this:

E 2 − P∗2 = E 2 − c2p2 = m0

(20)

6.2 Energy and Superluminal Motion

Let us begin with the expression v = √E 2 − m0

4/m0c0 ≥ c0. It follows from here that in
the framework of LSR a particle will move with superluminal velocity, if the particle energy
will satisfy the equality:

2c0

Etr ≥

(21)
This energy is equal ∼ 720 keV for electron and ∼ 1330 Mev for proton and neutron. We may
conclude from here that neutron physics of nuclear reactors may be formulated in the non-
relativistic approximation in LSR (as in SR). The electrons with the energy E > 720 keV (for
example, from radioactive decay) should be superluminal particles in LSR. Particle physics
on modern accelerators such as Serpukhov one with the energy of protons 66 GeV (1 Gev =
1000 MeV) should be physics of superluminal motion in the framework of LSR, if it would
be realized in reality.

√2E0 = √2m0c0

6.3 Equations of Motion for Charged Particle in LSR

After putting the expression for the speed of light (18) into the equations of motion (12), we
obtain [26]:

From here it can be seen that the integrals of motion are either the generalized momentum
cp and energy E, or the associated velocity of a particle v and the speed of light c in the
absence of external forces.

6.5 LSR and Experiment

Let us consider the examples of experiments, the interpretation of which is close to or
coincides with their interpretation in SR.

The Michelson Experiment [1, 5]. For the case of a terrestrial light source the negative
result of the experiment may be explained by space isotropy (the speed of light is the same in
all directions). Owing to this circumstance the interference pattern will not be changed for
a terrestrial observer at rotation of the interferometer. In the case of a extraterrestrial light
source the negative result may be explained by two factors: the space isotropy and the square
2

dependence of the speed of light from the velocity V of a light source c = coq1 + V 2/co

[26].

The arising little correction is the the order of V 2/c0
experimental result in linear approximation [26]. (Here V is the velocity of ﬂuid).

The Fizeau Experiment [1, 5]. The explanation is similar to the one accepted in SR.
2 ≪ 1 and does not inﬂuence on the
The Bonch-Bruevich and Molchanov Experiment [33]. The authors compared the
speeds of the light radiated by the eastern and western equatorial edge of the solar disk.
2 does not depend on the
direction of the light source motion V . Therefore the speed of light will be the same for both
the western and eastern edges of the solar disk. As in SR it is in accord with the negative
result of the experiment [26].

In the framework of LSR the speed of light c = c0q1 + V 2/c0

The Sadeh Experiment [34]. In the experiment the distinction between the speeds
of the gamma - quanta, arising as a result of the electron - positron annihilation in ﬂight,
has been observed depending on the angle between the gamma - quanta. By virtue of the
independence of the speed of light c from the direction of the velocity of the source V, the
result of the experiment should be negative in LSR as well as in SR [26].

Let us consider also the experiments, which interpretation in LSR is diﬀerent from their the
interpretations in SR.

The Doppler Eﬀect [1, 23].

In LSR the change of a wavelength λ is described by
2 − V nx/c0]. The change of

9

a frequency is described by the formula ω = ω0(c/c0)q1 − V 2/c2/(1 − V nx/c) = ω0/(1 −

V nx/c0) [26]. Here θ = arccosnx is the angle of the observation; V is the emitter velocity. It
is follows from here that in LSR there is no Doppler transversal frequent shift because with
nx = 0, ω = ωo. For a wavelength the Doppler transversal shift is retained. Hence in LSR
the parameters of redshifts zλ and zω do not coincide with each other and are equal zλ =
(λ−λ0)/λ0 → 2V /c0 at nx = −1, V → ∞; zω = (ω0−ω)/ω0 → 1 at nx = −1, V → ∞. In non
- relativistic approximation they coincide with each other zλ ∼ −V nx/co, zω ∼ −V nx/co.
When the emitters move with signiﬁcant velocities, the distinction begins to show itself with
the shifts zλ ≥ 0.6. The fulﬁllment of the inequality zλ ≥ √2 = 1.41 is the criterion for
longitudinal (nx = −1) superluminal motion. The fulﬁllment of the inequality zλ ≥ √2−1 =

0.41 is the criterion for m transversal) (nx = 0) superluminal motion [26]. The superluminal
quasars 3C279 (zλ = 0.536), 3N345 (zλ = 0.595), 3C179 (zλ = 0.846), NRAO 140 ( zλ =
1.258) [21] satisfy the letter criterion. In particular, the calculated transversal velocity of
the QSO NRAO 140 expansion is V⊥ ∼ 2co. It is surprising that this velocity is close to
the low bound of these velocities 3co within the Friedmann cosmological model [21]. It is
important for LSR to determine the frequent redshifts zω of these superluminal objects and
compare them with the lambda redshifts zλ as well as to solve the problem of the existence
of the limit zω ≤ 1. It will permit one to distinguish between LSR and SR because in SR
the ratio zλ = zω is true. The redshift of the radio emission from neutral hydrogen HI on
the frequency corresponding to the line 21 cm is attractive for this purpose. However in this
frequency range the experimental data on superluminal quasars are not avallable. Therefore
to reject LSR is not possible now.

Let us also pay attention to the relationship between the speeds of light c and co and the
parameters of redshifts c = c0(1 + zλ)/(1 + zω) → c0(1 + zλ)/2 in LSR. (The latter formula
is true with zω ∼ 1). We can conclude that it is the Loiseau formula [22]. Its application
to the observational interpretation was considered in Introduction. According to [22], the
speed of light from the galaxy NGC 5668 with the parameters of redshifts zλ = 0.00580 and
zω = 0.00526, is equal c = c0 + 182.04 km / sec. In the light of the present work this result,
however, is not of statistical signiﬁcance, as the redshift parameter zλ = 0.00580 << 1.41.
Therefore the conclusion that the NGC 5668 galaxy is superluminal fail. It also holds for
the quasar PKS 2134 with parameter of redshift zλ = 1.935. After putting this value and
frequency shift zω = 1 into above - mentioned formula we can conclude that the speed of light
from the PKS 2134 quasar is c = 300.000· 2.936/2 = 440.400 ∼ 440.000 km / sec. Thus, the
Loiseau estimation has theoretical character. This circumstance indicates once more that it
is necessary to obtain experimental data concerning the redshifts for superluminal quasars
in the radio-frequency and optical ranges [26].

Aberration of light [1, 5]. By analogy with SR we have for one - half of the aberration
angle: sinα = V /c; α ∼ (V /c0)(c0/c) = 10−4(c0/c) ∼ 10−4(2/(1 + zλ)) = (2/(1 + zλ)) · 20, 5
seconds of arc. (The latter is true with large zλ). It follows from here that, for example,
c = 2, 86c0, α = 7.2 seconds of arc for the Q 1158 + 4635 quasar with the redshift zλ = 4.73
[35]. The 7.2 seconds of arc value should be checked in the experiment [26].
Superluminal motion of nuclear reaction products. Such phenomenon is impossible
in SR. But it is possible in LSR, if the energy of a particle will be greater than √2E0. It
is 150 MeV for µ - mesons. Therefore in LSR (if it is realized in reality) the appearance
of atmospheric µ - mesons near the surface of the Earth may be explained by superluminal

10

motion of the mesons with the velocity of the order of 6 · 106/2, 2 · 10−6 ∼ 3 · 1012 cm/sec,
2 ∼ 10.6 GeV corresponds to the given
or 100c0 [26]. The energy Eµ = m0,µc0c ∼ 100m0,µc0
velocity in LSR. In virtue of the absence of the limitation on the upper value of the speed
of light, faster particles explaining the results of Clay, Crouch [17] and Cooper experiments
[18], may be observed in front of the particles from nuclear reactions.

2(0)/c0

to inﬁnity vx(t) = c0q1 + vy

Motion of a charged particle in electromagnetic ﬁeld. By integrating (12), we ﬁnd
that in the case a particle moves in constant homogeneous electrical ﬁeld, its velocity tends
2sh(eEt/m0c0) → ∞ [26]. In SR the particle velocity is
limited by value co as is known [23]. For the case of constant homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
H = (0, 0, Hz) the frequency of rotation of a particle is constant and does not depend on the
energy of a particle ω = eHz/m0c0 = const in LSR (ω ∼ 1/E in SR [23]). However if the
particle energy is great, the radius of particle rotation is connected with the particle energy
by the ratio r ∼ E /eHz as in SR. The diﬀerences in the radiuses of rotation is observed in
2 < E < m0c0v at v >> co. The
the intermediate range of particle energies, when M0c0
considered properties of particle motions in electrical and magnetic ﬁelds may be essential
in the theory of linear and cyclical accelerators [26].

7 Conclusion

Summing we shall note that the validity of LSR or the proper ﬁeld of its application are
not clear yet now. In any case the problem arises which concerns the reason of the choice of
preferable symmetry in the nature. Local SR transforms into SR, if c′ = c.

Abstract

The relativistic motion of an arbitrary point of an accelerated rigid rod is discussed
for the case when velocity and acceleration are directed along the rod’s length. The
discussion includes the case of a time-dependent force applied to a single point, as
well as a time-independent force arbitrary distributed along the rod. The validity and
meaning of the rigidity assumption are critically examined.

1 Introduction

There are several articles which discuss relativistic properties of accelerated rods for the
case when the force is time-independent and applied to a single point on the rod. Cavalleri
and Spinelli [1] found two important results for such a case. First, the application point
accelerates in the same way as it would accelerate if all mass of the rod were concentrated in
this point. Second, “a rod, pushed by a force, accelerates less than the same rod pulled by the
same force”. Some similar results were found by Nordtvedt [2] and Gr/on [3], who concluded
that “a rocket ship can be accelerated to higher speeds with a given engine by putting the
engine in the nose of the rocket”. We agree with the ﬁrst statement in quotation marks, but
we disagree with the second one. At ﬁrst sight, the second statement in quotation marks
may seem to be a consequence of the ﬁrst one. On the other hand, the second statement
cannot be consistent with the conservation of energy. We resolve the paradox by generalizing
the analysis to time-dependent forces. As an example we consider the case of a uniformly
accelerated rod during a ﬁnite time interval, after which the force turns oﬀ.
It appears
that although the motion of the rod depends on the application point of the force, the ﬁnal
velocity and relativistic length after the termination of acceleration do not depend on it.
From the point of view of a still inertial observer, a pushed rod accelerates slower than a
pulled one, but the acceleration of a pushed rod lasts longer than that of a pulled one.

In this article we also generalize the ﬁrst result of [1] by considering the case of many
time-independent forces applied to various points. We ﬁnd formula (35) which determines

1

the point which accelerates in the same way as it would accelerate if all forces were applied
to this point.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we present a general method of ﬁnding
the motion of an arbitrary point of a non-rotating rigid rod, when the motion of one of
its points is known. We also present a general method of ﬁnding the motion of a point on
the rigid rod, to which a single time-dependent force is applied. In Section 3 we apply this
general formalism to the case of a uniformly accelerated rod during a ﬁnite time interval,
after which the force turns oﬀ. In Section 4 we discuss the physical meaning of the results
obtained in Section 3. In Section 5 we analyze the case of many time-independent forces
applied to various points. In Section 6 we critically examine the validity and meaning of the
rigidity assumption. Section 7 is devoted to concluding remarks.

2 The length of a rigid accelerated rod

Let us consider a rod whose velocity and acceleration are directed along its length, but are
otherwise arbitrary functions of time. We assume that the accelerated rod is rigid, which
means that an observer located on the rod does not observe any change of the rod’s length.
(Later we discuss the validity of such an assumption.) Since the rod is rigid and does not
rotate, it is enough to know how one particular point of the rod (labelled for example by A)
changes its position with time. Let S be a stationary inertial frame and S′ the accelerated
frame of an observer on the rod. We assume that we know the function xA(tA), so we also
know the velocity

v(tA) =

dxA(tA)
dtA

.

Later we consider how the function xA(tA) can be found if it is known how the forces F (t′)
act on the rod. The function (1) deﬁnes the inﬁnite sequence of comoving inertial frames
S′(tA). The rod is instantaneously still for an observer in this frame. This means that he
observes no contraction, i.e. L0 = x′
A, where L0 is the proper length of the rod, while
A and B label the back and front ends of the rod, respectively. He observes both ends at
the same instant, so t′

A = 0. From the Lorentz transformations

B − x′

B − t′

xA,B = γv(tA)(x′

where γv(tA) = (1 − v2(tA)/c2)−1/2, we obtain

From (3) and the known functions xA(tA) and (1) we can ﬁnd the function xB(tA). From
(4) and the known function (1) we can ﬁnd the function tA(tB). Thus we ﬁnd the function

xB − xA = L0γv(tA) ,

tB − tA = L0γv(tA)

xB(tA(tB)) ≡ ˜xB(tB) .

To determine how the rod’s length changes with time for an observer in S, both ends of the
rod must be observed at the same instant, so tB = tA ≡ t. Thus the length as a function of
time is given by

Let us now see how velocity (1) can be found if the force F (t′

A) applied to the point A is

known. We introduce the quantity

L(t) = ˜xB(t) − xA(t) .

a(t′

A) = F (t′

A)/m(t′

A) ,

which we call acceleration, having in mind that this would be the second time derivative of
a position only in the nonrelativistic limit. Here m(t′
A) is the proper mass of the rod, which,
in general, can also change with time, for example by loosing the fuel of a rocket engine. As
shown in [1], if there is only one force, applied to a speciﬁc point on an elastic body, and if
F and m do not vary with time, then this point moves in the same way as it would move
if all mass of the body were concentrated in this point. If acceleration changes with time
slowly enough, then this is approximately true for a time-dependent acceleration as well.
Later we discuss the conditions for validity of such an approximation. Here we assume that
these conditions are fulﬁlled. The application point is labelled by A. Thus the inﬁnitesimal
change of velocity is given by

The point on the rod labelled by A does not change, i.e. dx′
as

q

A = 0, so (10) can be integrated

which gives a function tA = f (t′

It is also interesting to see how the length of a still rod changes with time from the point
of view of an accelerated observer. The generalized Lorentz transformations between an
inertial frame and an accelerated frame, as shown by Nelson [4], are given by

x = γu(t′)x′ +

γu(t′)u(t′)dt′ ,

accelerated observer observes both ends at the same instant, so t′

observes is L′ = x′

3 Uniformly accelerated rod during a ﬁnite time inter-

val

In the preceding section we have made a very general analysis. Here we want to illustrate
these results on a simple realistic example, in order to understand the physical meaning of
these general results. We consider the case of a rod which is still for t < 0, but at t = 0 it
turns on its engine which gives the constant acceleration a to the application point during
A < T ′ we
a ﬁnite time interval T ′, after which the engine turns oﬀ. From (9) and (11) for t′

4 Interpretation

We see the inequivalence between a still observer observing an accelerated rod and an accel-
erated observer observing a still rod. For an accelerated observer, the acceleration lasts for
a shorter time, as can be seen from (17). The time dependence of the length of a still rod is
given by the “naive” result (13), while the naive result (22) does not work for an accelerated
rod. However, (22) is a good approximation if aL0/c2 ≪ 1.

We also see that the results for a pulled rod are meaningless if aL0/c2 > 1. This suggests
that the rod cannot remain rigid under such conditions. To understand why is that so, we
calculate the velocity of the back end for a pulled rod. The result is

d˜xA(t)
dt

=

at
(1 − aL0/c2)2 + (at/c)2

.

q

(25)

We see that this velocity increases as aL0 increases and reaches the velocity of light when
aL0 = c2. Since no part of the rod can exceed the velocity of light, the rod cannot remain
rigid for aL0/c2 > 1.

Although the time dependence of the rod’s length depends on whether the rod is pushed,
pulled or still, the ﬁnal length and velocity after the forces are turned oﬀ do not depend on it.
But what varies is the time needed to observe the termination of acceleration. A still observer
observes that the acceleration of the front end of the accelerated rod lasts longer than that
of the back end. If the rod is pulled, it seems to him that the consequence (termination
of acceleration of the back end) occurs before the cause (termination of acceleration of the
front end). However, this is not a paradox, because there is a space-like separation between
these two events. A still observer cannot actually know whether this rod is pulled by an

6

acceleration a, or is pushed by an acceleration ˜a, given by

˜a =

a
1 − aL0/c2 .

(26)

(27)

This can be seen for example by replacing the acceleration in the ﬁrst case (0 ≤ t ≤ T ) in
(21) by ˜a and comparing it with the ﬁrst case (0 ≤ t ≤ T (1 − aL0/c2)) in (23). In particular,
if the rod is pulled by acceleration a = c2/L0, for a still observer it looks the same as it is
pushed by acceleration ˜a = ∞. If this pulling lasts time T , this is the same as the pushing
lasts time ˜T = T (1 − aL0/c2) = 0.

Formula (26) can be generalized to an arbitrary point on the rod. If acceleration a is
A, then this is the same as acceleration a(x′) is applied to the point

applied to the point x′
x′, where

a(x′) =

a

1 + a (x′ − x′

A)/c2 .

The important consequence of this is that an observer in a uniformly accelerated rocket does
not feel an equivalent homogeneous gravitational force, but rather an equivalent gravitational
force which decreases with x′, as given by (27). This result is obtained also in [3]. A long
rigid rod is equivalent to a series of independent shorter rods, each having its own engine,
but not with equal accelerations, but rather with accelerations which are related by formula
(27).

Note also that one can replace a by a(x′) in the ﬁrst case (0 ≤ tA ≤ T ) in (16) and thus
obtain how the velocity of various points of a rod depends on time. The result coincides
with the result obtained by Cavalleri and Spinelli [1]. They found this result by solving
a certain partial diﬀerential equation, so our derivation is much simpler. In addition, our
method allows a generalization to time-dependent accelerations as well.

5 A set of forces with various application points

It is shown in [1] that if a time-independent force is applied to a single point on the rod, then
this point moves in the same way as it would move if all mass of the rod were concentrated
in this point. However, if there are many forces directed along the length of a rigid rod,
each applied to a diﬀerent point on the rod, then, obviously, all these points cannot move in
the same way as they would move if all mass of the rod were concentrated in these points.
We remind the reader that it is enough only to ﬁnd out how one particular point of the rod
moves, because the motion of the rest of rod is determined by the rigidity requirement. Thus
the problem of many forces can be reduced to a problem of ﬁnding a point x which moves
in the same way as it would move if all forces were applied to this point (in this section we
omit a bar on x′, remembering that this is a coordinate on the rod in the accelerating rod’s
frame).

Assume that N forces Fi, i = 1, . . . , N, are applied to the rod, each applied to the point
xi. If all forces are of the same sign, then the rod (with a ﬁnite width) can be cut in N
pieces, each with a mass mi and each with only one applied force Fi, in such a way that the
collection of pieces moves in the same way as the whole rod would move without the cutting.

However, the masses mi are only auxiliary quantities. From (32) and the ﬁrst equation in
(29) we ﬁnd

Xk
This is one of the ﬁnal results, where masses mi do not appear. When N = 1 or all forces
are applied to the same point, (33) reduces to the already known result that the application
point has the acceleration ai = F/m. The point x which accelerates in the same way as it
would accelerate if all forces were applied to this point is given by

so from (34), (33) and the second equation in (29) we ﬁnd

P
Formulae (33) and (35) are the main new results of this article. We have derived them
under the assumption that all forces Fi are of the same sign. However, this assumption is
not crucial for the validity of (33) and (35). Since there must exist general formulae which
reduce to (33) and (35) when all forces are of the same sign, we may conclude that these
general formulae can be nothing else but (33) and (35) themselves. For example, one could
suspect that, in a general formula, Fk should be replaced by |Fk|, but one can discard such

the same point.

Are there any problems if all forces are not of the same sign? We assume that the square
bracket in (32) is always positive (see the discussion connected with formula (25)). Thus,
j Fj, then the
if some force Fi is of the opposite sign with respect to the total force F =
corresponding mass mi is formally negative, which means that the rod cannot be cut in a
way which was described at the beginning of this section. However, cutting the rod is not
essential at all.

P

From (35) one can also see that if all forces are not of the same sign, then the point x

may not lie on the rod itself. This may look slightly peculiar, but is not inconsistent.

Formulae (33) and (35) can be easily generalized to a continuous distribution of force.

For example, (35) generalizes to

x =

dy f (y)y
dy f (y)

,

R

(36)

where f (y) is a linear density of force, f (y) = dF/dy.

6 Discussion

In this section we want to critically examine the validity of the rigidity assumption, by taking
into consideration, on a qualitative level, the elastic properties of a rod.

First, it is clear that, in general, the proper length of a uniformly accelerated rod will
not be equal to the proper length of the same rod when it is still. For example, we expect
that a pushed rod will be contracted, while a pulled rod will be elongated. This is not a
relativistic eﬀect, but rather a real change of a proper length. It is important, however, that
if acceleration does not change with time, then this proper length does not change with time
either. Therefore, all formulae of this article which describe a uniform acceleration during a
long time interval, are correct if L0 is understood as a proper length which depends on the
acceleration and application point of the force, but not on the time of the accelerated frame.
The dynamics of a rod when acceleration changes with time is more complicated. How-
ever, some qualitative conclusions can be drawn without much eﬀort. When acceleration
is changed, the rod needs some relaxation time ∆t (here t is time in the rod’s accelerated
frame) to reach a new equilibrium proper length which depends on the new acceleration.
During this time we expect one or a few damped oscillations, so ∆t is of the order

∆t ≈ L0/vs ,

(37)

where vs is the velocity of propagation of a disturbance in a material. This velocity is equal
to the velocity of sound (not of light) in a material of which is the rod made. If acceleration
changes slowly enough, then we can use the adiabatic approximation, i.e. we can assume
that the length of the rod is always equal to its equilibrium length which depends on the
instantaneous acceleration. The small change of acceleration means that ∆a/a ≪ 1 during
the relaxation time ∆t, so from (37) and the relation ∆a = ˙a∆t, we ﬁnd the criteria for the
validity of the adiabatic approximation

˙a ≪

avs
L0

.

9

(38)

In practice, ˙a is never inﬁnite, i.e. the instantaneous changes of acceleration do not exist.

We know from experience, for example, that a realistic rocket under realistic accelerations
never changes its proper length signiﬁcantly. Thus, all formulae derived in Sections 2 and 3
can be applied to such rockets when they reach relativistic velocities, because the relativistic
changes of length are then much larger then the changes of length due to elastic properties.

7 Conclusion

In this article we have relativistically solved a general problem of motion of an arbitrary
point of a rigid rod accelerated by a time-dependent force applied to a single point, for the
case when the force and velocity are directed along the rod’s length. The time-dependence of
a rod’s relativistic length depends on the application point of the force, but the ﬁnal velocity
and length after the termination of acceleration do not depend on it. An observer on a
uniformly accelerated rod does not feel a homogeneous inertial force, but rather an inertial
force which decreases in the direction of acceleration. The main new result is formula (35),
which determines the motion of a rigid rod when many time-independent forces directed
along the rod’s length are applied to various points. The case of many time-dependent
forces applied to various points is more complicated, so we have not considered this case. In
addition, we have critically examined the validity and meaning of the assumption of rigidity.

Electromagnetic radiation of the travelling
spin wave propagating in an antiferromagnetic
plate. Exact solution.

A.A.Zhmudsky

February 2, 2008

Abstract

The exact solution of radiation problem of a spin wave travelling in
an antiferromagnetic (AFM) plate was found. The spin wave with in-
plane oscillations of antiferromagnetism vector was considered. In this
case the magnetization vector is oscillating being perpendicular to the
AFM plate and depends on time and plane coordinates as travelling
wave does. This model allows to obtain exact analytical expression for
Hertzian vector and, consequently, the retarded potentials and ﬁeld
strengths as well.

It is shown that expressions obtained describe Cherenkov radiation
caused by the travelling wave. The radiated electromagnetic wave is
the T EM type if a phase velocity exceeds the speed of light. Other-
wise electric and magnetic ﬁeld values exponentially decrease in the
direction normal to the plate. The energy losses were evaluated also.

1 Introduction

It is known that not only particles can be the Cherenkov radiation sources but
also, so-called, superlight ”reﬂections” [1] formed by the motion of particles
number large enough.

We want to point out that such eﬀects can be observed at spin wave
propagation on the magnetic surface. In particular, it is possible to receive

the exact solution of radiation problem of a spin wave travelling in an anti-
ferromagnetic plate.

2 Spin wave propagation in the antiferromag-

netic plate

Let us consider planar antiferromagnetic (AFM) containing two magnetic
sublattices with magnetizations ~M1 and ~M2. Total magnetization of the
AFM ~M = ~M1 + ~M2 in the ground state is equal zero ( ~M1 =

= M0).

At small k phase velosity of spin wave increases inﬁnitely that is why
V > c, equation (5) has stable harmonic solution and Cherenkov radiation
takes place.

Vectors ~l and

to receive the exact solution of the radiation problem.

scalar potential ϕ via:

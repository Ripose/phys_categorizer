Abstract

Although many papers have appeared on the theory of photographing
relativistically moving objects, pioneered by the classic work of Penrose and
Terrell, three problems remain outstanding. 1. There does not seem to exist a
general formula which gives the projection of a relativistically moving object,
applicable to any object no matter how complicated, on a two-dimensional
plane in conformity with Terrell’s observation. 2. No resolution seems to have
been provided for the associated so-called ‘train’ paradox.
3. No analytical
demonstration seems to have been oﬀered on how the Lorentz contraction
may be actually detected on a photograph. This paper addresses all of these
three problems. The analysis does not require any more than trigonometry
and elementary diﬀerentiation.

1 Introduction

pearance of relativistically moving objects several reﬁnements and extensions of the

above work have been carried out (see, e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]). Three problems
seem, however, to remain outstanding.

1. There does not seem to be in the literature a general formula which provides
the projection of a relativistically moving object, applicable to any object no
matter how complicated, on a two-dimensional plane in conformity with Ter-
rell’s observation. Terrell’s observation is that diﬀerent points on the object
must ‘emit’ light at diﬀerent times in order to reach an observation point si-
multaneously.

2. No resolution seems to have been oﬀered of one of the most puzzling aspects in
the above investigations referred to as the ‘train’ paradox. No much attention
has been given to this in the literature. This paradox has its roots in the early
work of Terrell [2] and Weisskopf [3] and was emphasized by Mathews and
Lakshmanan [8] almost 30 years ago.
In its simplest terms, the latter paradox
arises in the following manner. One often reads in the above papers that an
object appears to be rotated when in relative motion to an observation frame
due to the fact that diﬀerent points on the object must ‘emit’ light at diﬀerent
times in order to reach an observation point simultaneously. Such an inference
seems to indicate that a rectangular block, for example, sliding on (smooth)
rails and the edges of its lower side in contact with them, appears oﬀ them due
to the relative motion with the rails stationary relative to the observer, and
hence the paradox. The same reasoning may be applied, as shown below, to
an object with a horizontal ﬂat top touching a ‘smooth’ ﬂat horizontal plane.
Again this would seem to imply, in particular cases, that one end of the object
had miraculously broken and gone through the ﬂat plane due to the relative
motion.

3. No analytical demonstration seems to have been given on how the Lorentz
contraction may be detected on a photograph. The key point that we discover
is that, due to Terrell’s observation, the portion of a moving ruler to the left
of the observer seems elongated, while the portion of the ruler to the right of
the observer seems to be shrunk. These eﬀects work, respectively, against
and with the Lorentz contraction, in general masking it. Accordingly, we may
locate a critical point on the ruler such that the Lorentz contraction is visible
for a small interval on the ruler around this point.

The word ‘appears’ or the statement ‘appears as on a photograph’ have caused
some confusion over the years. Any such wordings necessarily involve assump-
tions used in one’s analysis. To be precise, the latter are meant in the following

manner, as working hypotheses, in the present investigation and are based on
taking into account these three points :

(i) Terrell’s observation that diﬀerent points on an object must ‘emit’ light
at diﬀerent times in order to reach an observation point simultaneously.
There is an inherit limitation in considering a point observation site. The
removal of such a restriction is certainly a formidable task, which will not
be attempted in this paper.

(ii) The Lorentz transformations.

(iii) The piercing by these light rays of an appropriate two-dimensional plane

in the observation frame.

In section 2, we provide a complete and elementary derivation of the explicit
(nonlinear) transformations arising from the application of the three points (i)–(iii),
which may be directly applied to any object no matter how complicated. The for-
mulae obtained are easily accessible to students and suﬃciently precise to illustrate
faithfully the main features of the Terrell eﬀect. These transformations are appro-
priately referred to as nonlinear Terrell transformations. The closest investigation
to these transformations was given by Hickey [9], who, however, applied methods of
mapping out the tangents to points on an object. The latter also provides no room
for resolving the ‘train’ paradox. Although the demonstration of the absence of a
paradox seems non-trivial, we provide in section 3 a rather elementary resolution of
the ‘train’ paradox. The visibility of the Lorentz contraction is studied in section 4,
where a critical point on a moving ruler is singled out around which the Lorentz

deals with our conclusions.

2 Nonlinear Terrell transformations

Consider the relative motion of the proper inertial frame F′ of an object to be along
the x-axis of an observation frame F with speed v. Let (x′, y′, z′), (x, y, z) denote,
respectively, the labellings of an arbitrary point on the object in the corresponding
F′ and F frames. The observation point O is at a height h, along the z-axis (see
ﬁgure 1) above the origin O of the F-frame. When the origins O and O′, at t = 0
and t′ = 0, of F and F′ frames coincide and the observer at O sees this happening

We are interested in all the light rays from the object which reach point O simulta-
neously. The light ray from a point (x, y, z) on the object will pierce a U-V plane
speciﬁed by a unit vector ˆn as shown in ﬁgure 1 perpendicular to the former. Here
U and V deﬁne coordinate axes on the two-dimensional plane on which the object is
projected. A point (x′, y′, z′) on the object, as labelled in its rest frame F′, will be
mapped into a point (U, V ) on the two-dimensional plane. d denotes the distance
from O (the observer) to the origin of the UV plane. For concreteness ˆn, emerging

3 Resolution of the ‘train’ paradox

Let ﬁrst β = 0. Consider a horizontal line parallel to the x′-axis, that is, take y′ and
z′ as ﬁxed. Suppose that the object in question touches this line at some point, say,
(a, y′, z′). x′ takes on arbitrary values along the line with x′ = a corresponding to
the point of contact just mentioned (see ﬁgure 4). That is, a is the x′ coordinate of
a point of contact with the horizontal line (for β = 0) and also provides a reference
point from which other points will be deﬁned as we shall now see. From (6) and (8)

Hence the above horizontal line is mapped into a straight line in the U-V plane.
We recall that (15) was derived for β = 0. For β
= 0, it is readily checked that U
and V given, respectively, in (9) and (10) fall on the same line for x′ = a. That is,
= 0, U and V also satisfy equation (15). Hence any point on the object which
for β
for β = 0 lies on the straight line (15) must also lie on the same line for β
= 0.
This provides the resolution of the ‘train’ paradox.

(cid:3)

For example, refer to ﬁgure 2(b) (and (a)) and consider an imaginary line
joining the tips of the three roofs as drawn in the observation frame. Now consider
the corresponding case for β = 0.9 in ﬁgure 3(b) with the houses pulled, so to
speak, to slide along this line relative to a stationary observer. Here one has the
impression that the tip of the roof of the ﬁrst house on the left has cut through
and passed through this line. The above demonstration shows that the tips of
the roofs of all the three houses remain always in contact for β
= 0 as well with
the straight line but at diﬀerent points for β = 0 and β
= 0 due to the relative motion.

4 Visibility of the Lorentz contraction

Consider two rulers of equal proper lengths each moving to the right with speed v,
with one approaching and one receding from the observer (see ﬁgure 5). The end
points of the ruler on the left are labelled by 1, 2, while the ones on the right by 3,
In reference to the ruler on the left (approaching the observer),
4 (see ﬁgure 5).
in order that light ‘emitted’ from the end points 1 and 2 reach the observer
simultaneously, light should be ‘emitted’ from point 1 ﬁrst.
In the meantime, the
ruler moves to the right and the end point 2 reaches some point 2′ and ‘emits’ light
to reach the observer at the same time as light that was ‘emitted’ from end point
1 earlier. Accordingly, the ruler seems to be elongated with end points eﬀectively
deﬁned by 1 and 2′. On the other hand, the same reasoning applied to the ruler
on the right (receding from the observer) shows that the ruler seems to be shrunk
with end points eﬀectively deﬁned by 3′ and 4. These facts have nothing to do with
the Lorentz transformations or the Lorentz contraction, but they would contribute
in forming the ﬁnal projected image on the two-dimensional plane, and would,
in general, mask the visibility of the Lorentz contraction, which is of diﬀerent nature.

Figure 5: For light ‘emitted’ from both ends of the moving ruler on the left
to reach the observer simultaneously, the ruler labelled by 1, 2 in its proper
frame is eﬀectively deﬁned by 1, 2′ to the observer and seems to be elongated.
Similarly, the ruler on the right, which is labelled by 3, 4 in its proper frame, is
eﬀectively deﬁned by 3′, 4 to the observer and seems to be shrunk.

The old fundamental and critical question now comes to haunt us. Can we
photograph the Lorentz contraction? To answer this question, consider a ruler
moving to the right with speed βc such that its lower edge is at z′ = 0, and y′
= 0 is
arbitrary but has some ﬁxed value. We consider the ruler to have a portion of it to
the right of the observer and a portion to the left of it. We set the observer at the
origin O of his coordinate system, i.e. set h = 0. We also choose the optic axis to
be speciﬁed by the unit vector ˆn =

To ﬁnd the above critical point in question on the ruler, draw a line making an
angle θ = cos−1(β) with the x′-axis (see ﬁgure 6) before setting the ruler to move
with a given pre-assigned speed βc. This line will cross a point on the lower edge
of the ruler deﬁning the critical point in question.

5 Conclusions

That there is contraction on the right-hand side of the houses (ﬁgure 3) and relative
elongation on their left-hand sides is clear when referring to ﬁgure 5 and is due to
the fact that light ‘emitted’ from the houses from diﬀerent parts must be ‘emitted’
at diﬀerent times to reach the observation point O simultaneously. We have also
seen that all the lines that are parallel to the x′-axis remain straight lines in the U-V
plane for all β, and this is the content of the resolution of the ‘train’ paradox given

or the z′ axes for β = 0 become curved in the U-V plane for β
= 0. The latter are
quite clear in ﬁgure 3(b), for example. Finally, the eﬀect of relative contraction and
elongation of a ruler discussed at the beginning of this section, which, in general,
would mask the Lorentz contraction, becomes, so to speak, ‘unmasked’ around a
particular point on the ruler moving with any given speed β and is easily located.
The Lorentz contraction becomes visible for a small interval of length ∆x′ around
this critical point.

All of the above observations and deductions follow from our general formulae
obtained, which are easily accessible to students and suﬃciently precise to illustrate
faithfully the main features of the Terrell eﬀect.
The next programme in this
fundamental problem of relativity is how to generalize the observation site from a
pointlike to a non-pointlike one. This is a formidable problem which will not be
attempted here and remains to be tackled.

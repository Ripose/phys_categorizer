In this brief report, the group velocity of the eigen-modes in sonic crystals is derived, and shown
to equal the averaged energy velocity of the eigen-modes. How the group velocity can be used to
describe acoustic energy ﬂows in sonic crystals is discussed.

PACS numbers: 43.20.+g, 43.90.+v

The phenomenon of band structures, revealed as waves
propagate through periodic structures, was put on a solid
foundation in the context of Bloch’s theorem[1]. It was
ﬁrst studied for electronic systems. Since the central
physics behind electronic band structures lies in the wave
nature of electrons, it is natural to extend the study
to any wave systems in general, and to electromagnetic
(EM) and acoustic systems in particular.

Not excluding other eﬀorts, band structures were ear-
lier addressed for general waves in periodic structures by
Brillouin[2], then to EM waves by Yariv and Yeh[3], later
by Yablonovitch[4] and John[5]. Since then, the study of
EM waves in periodic structures has been booming, even-
tually extended to the exploration of acoustic waves in
periodic structures (e. g. Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9]), leading to the
establishment of the ﬁeld of photonic crystals (PCs) and
sonic crystals (SCs).

Sonic crystals (SCs) are made of periodically struc-
tured materials which are sensitive to acoustic waves, and
have been studied both intensively and extensively. The
exciting phenomenon of band structures in sonic crystals
allows for many possible applications. It has been recog-
nized that SCs could be used as sound shields, acoustic
ﬁlters, acoustic ﬂow guiding, sonic crystal lenses, and so
on[7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].

One of the top issues in the research of acoustic crys-
tals is how to describe the propagation of acoustic waves
in crystal structures, by analogy with the photonic crys-
tals. The common theoretical approach to electromag-
netic propagation in periodic media has been given in
Ref. [3], and may be summarized as follows[16]. The
Maxwell equations are ﬁrst derived for waves in periodic
media. By Bloch theorem, the solution can be expanded
in terms of Bloch waves. The solution is then substituted
into the governing equations to obtain an eigen-equation
that determines the dispersion relations between the fre-
quency and the wave vector that lies within the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone for the eigen-modes. These relations are
termed as frequency band structures. Since it has been
proved[3, 17] that the averaged energy velocity ~ve equals
the group velocity which can be obtained as the gradi-
ent of the dispersion relations with the respect to the

∗Electronic address: zhen@shaw.ca

space of wave vectors, i. e. ~vg ≡ ∇ ~K ω, the investigation
of electromagnetic propagation in periodic structures is
thus reduced to the calculation of the group velocity from
the band structures.

Simply due to similarities between the electromag-
netic and acoustic waves, it is naturally expected that
the above prescription can be automatically adopted for
sonic crystals, and this recipe has been indeed used for
SCs in the literature (e. g. Ref. [18]). To the best of
our knowledge, however, so far there has been no at-
tempt in the literature to prove this analogy and con-
nection between PCs and SCs. Here, we wish to bridge
the gap. In this paper, we will provide a proof that in
analogy with PCs, the acoustic energy velocity of the
eigen-modes of a sonic crystal averaged within a unit cell
also equals the group velocity of these eigen-modes, de-
ﬁned as ~vg ≡ ∇ ~K ω. Moreover, we will discuss how the
group velocity can be used to describe acoustic energy
ﬂows in sonic crystals. In addition, following the work on
photonic crystals[19], it will be shown that measuring the
unit-cell volume averaged acoustic energy velocity can be
reduced to the measurement of the corresponding unit-
cell surface averaged components. Such a reduction is ex-
pected to facilitate the practical measurement of acoustic
energy ﬂows.

General - In the linear region, the propagation of
acoustic waves are governed by three physical princi-
ples: Newton’s second law, conservation law, and equa-
tion of states. And acoustic waves are characterized by
three major physical quantities: variations in pressure
and mass density, and the displacement velocity, denoted
respectively by δp, δρ, and ~u. The governing equations
are then

This equation can be written as

Here we assume that the band structure is known. Read-
ers may refer to Ref. [9] for details. We will prove that
the acoustic energy velocity of the eigen-modes of a sonic
crystal averaged within a unit cell equals the group ve-
locity of these eigen-modes.

represents the energy conservation. The quantities ~J and
U are the acoustic intensity and energy respectively.

Proof of ∇ ~Kω = ~ve - Now we consider sonic crystals.
We will consider three dimensional cases; the extension
to two dimensions is straightforward. The band struc-
tures can be readily computed by the plane-wave method.

Considering an arbitrary inﬁnitesimal change in ~K,
which induces the changes in ω, u, and p, Eqs. (11) and
(12) become

Due to the periodicity, the unit cell integration for any

Then we have

Since

δω = ~ve, ~K · δ ~K.

δω = ∇ ~Kω · δ ~K,

we have ﬁnally proved the identity for the group velocity
deﬁned as ~vg, ~K ≡ ∇ ~Kω:

~vg, ~K = ~ve, ~K = ∇ ~K ω.

When the index ~K for the eigen-mode is ignored, we
simply have

~vg = ~ve,

with ~vg = ∇ ~Kω, which was ﬁrst derived for PCs.

From the above, we know that ∇ ~Kω may describe the
averaged energy ﬂow in sonic crystals. For example,

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

the direction of averaged energy follows that of ∇ ~Kω.
As such, in the study of photonic crystals, ∇ ~K ω is re-
garded as the key quantity in discerning the photonic
ﬂows. Here, however, we must stress that the average
of the energy velocity is performed over the whole unit
cell of periodic media, under what condition such aver-
aged energy ﬂow can depict the actual energy ﬂow in
periodic media is worth considering. Moreover, since in
actual measurements it is often hard to detect the phys-
ical quantities inside the periodic media, how to obtain
the group velocity without having to put a detector into
the media needs also to be considered. In the following,
we will consider these two questions.

First, due to the periodicity, the local acoustic current

of the eigen-modes can be written as

~J ~K =

~J ~K( ~G)ei ~G·~r,

X~G

(26)

where ~G denotes the reciprocal vectors. It is shown that

1
Vc ZC

d~r ~J ~K =

Vc ZC

d~r

~J ~K( ~G)ei ~G·~r

X~G

=

~J ~K( ~G)δ0, ~G = ~J ~K(0).

(27)

X~G

From this result, we clearly see that when and only when
the component with ~G = 0 dominates, the group veloc-
ity ~vg = ∇ ~Kω can represent well the actual wave ﬂows.
In this case, the eigen-modes will behave eﬀectively as a
plane wave in a free space. Some recent studies indicate
that this may not be generally valid, and have caused
in certain circumstances some confusions about whether
waves are diﬀracted or refracted, referring to the discus-
sions in Refs. [20, 21]. Additionally, when a crystal is

ensoniﬁed by an external wave, many eigen-modes may
be excited for a given frequency, adding complications to
the determination of the actual acoustic propagation.

Reduction of integration - Second, it can be shown
that the unit volume averaged acoustic intensity h ~J ~Ki =
1
C d~r ~J ~K can be represented by surface averaged acous-
Vc
tic intensity. This is important, since it will allow us
R
to measure certain physical quantities at surfaces rather
than putting detectors into the volume of samples. To
brieﬂy show this, we will take the procedure stemming
from the excellent note [19]. For details, readers should
refer to Ref. [19].

We consider an acoustic lattice with the base lattice
vectors ~a1, ~a2, and ~a3. The base vectors for the reciprocal
lattice ~b1,~b2 and ~b3 are determined by ~ai ·~bj = 2πδij. We
will show that

h ~J ~Ki · ˆbi =

1
Si ZSi

ds ~J ~K · ˆbi,

(28)

~bi, and
where ˆbi is the unit vector of ~bi, given by ˆbi = Vc
2πSi
Si denotes the three surfaces of a unit cell, characterized
by ~a2 × ~a3, ~a3 × ~a1, ~a1 × ~a2 respectively.

For the stationary case, i. e. ∇ · ~J ~K = 0, we have from

Eq. (27)

~G · ~J ~K( ~G) = 0

(29)

To show the identity in Eq. (28), we consider the sur-
i=1 mi~bi, we have

face S3 as the example. Writing ~G =

Applying Eq. (29) to Eq. (30), we arrive at

1
S3 ZS3

ds ~J ~K · ˆb3 = ~J ~K(0) · ˆb3.

(31)

From Eq. (27) and by comparing to Eq. (31), we get

Following the same procedure, we can have the similar
results for the other two surfaces. Thereby we prove

h ~J ~Ki · ˆb3 =

1
Si ZSi

ds ~J ~K · ˆb3.

h ~J ~Ki · ˆbi =

1
Si ZSi

ds ~J ~K · ˆbi.

This result indicates that the components of the volume
averaged acoustic intensity can be reduced to the surface
averaged counterparts. Clearly, this is expected to be
very useful to actual measurements.

In summary, we have provided a proof that in analogy
with PCs, the acoustic energy velocity of the eigen-modes
of a sonic crystal averaged within a unit cell also equals
the group velocity of these eigen-modes, deﬁned as ~vg ≡
∇ ~Kω. We have also discussed the conditions that the
group velocity can be used to describe acoustic energy
ﬂows in sonic crystals. Then it is shown that the volume
averaged acoustic energy velocity can be reduced to the
surface averaged components.

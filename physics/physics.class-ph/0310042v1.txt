In the present paper, we investigate the properties of the sound generated by rubbing two objects.
It is clear that the sound is generated because of the rubbing between the contacting rough surfaces
of the objects. A model is presented to account for the role played by the surface roughness. The
results indicate that tonal features of the sound can be generated due to the ﬁniteness of the rubbing
surfaces. In addition, the analysis shows that with increasing rubbing speed, more and more high
frequency tones can be excited and the frequency band gets broader and broader, a feature which
appears to agree with our intuition or experience.

Rubbing objects is an everyday experience. People
who have gone through cold winters may have rubbed
hands to get warm. Rubbing also occurs in Nature. The
earthquake rupture is one of the most familiar but disas-
trous ones. A common observation is that rubbing can
generate sound or noise. The sound generated by rub-
bing hands is certainly common to nearly every one. The
sound generation by ice ﬂoe rubbing in the Arctic ocean
contributes signiﬁcantly to the ocean ambient noise[1, 2],
and may also help sea animals in ﬁnding appropriate
holes or breaking segments in ice to breath. The sound
generated by rubbing scoops against frying pans, how-
ever, is likely something most people would like to avoid.

In the present paper, we wish to consider the sound
generated by rubbing two ﬁnite objects. A model is pro-
posed for the sound generation due to the roughness of
the contacting surfaces of the two objects. The sound
ﬁeld is calculated and is analyzed for its relation to the
roughness and the rubbing speed. It is shown that sound
ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of a series of eigen-mode
excitations, leading to tonal features. It is suggested that
when the rubbing speed is low, only low frequency modes
are possibly excited. With increasing speed, more and
more high frequency modes can be excited, making the
frequency spectrum broader. These features appear to
be in accordance with our intuition or daily experience.

Consider the problem of two object rubbing. The con-
ceptual layout is shown in Fig. 1. One of the surfaces is
moving with a constant velocity along the positive y axis,
while the other is assumed to be at rest. For simplicity,
we assume that the two objects are identical; for diﬀer-
ent sizes, the eﬀective rubbing surface will equal that of
the smaller one. The shape of the objects is a cubic with
thickness L, width W and height H along the x-, y-, and
z-th axes respectively.

When rubbing occurs, a shear displacement ﬁeld will
be generated at the surfaces and is revealed as the shear
waves. Such shear waves can leak out through defects
or radiate out at the boundaries, and transform into the
sound we hear or record by machines, e. g. microphones.

The governing equation for the shear waves inside the

The stress can be separated into two parts: the mean
and the variation,
F (t, y, z) = hF (t, y, z)i +
∆F (y, z, t); here h·i denotes the ensemble average. We
assume that hF (t, y, z)i is independent of y, z. It can be
shown that the averaged stress can only excite the unin-
teresting zero-mode, and will thus be ignored.

From the above derivation, it is clear that the key is to
ﬁnd the correlation function of the ﬂuctuation part of
the stress at the surface, h∆F (y, z, t)∆F (y′, z′, t′)i. Ob-
viously the ﬂuctuation is caused by the roughness of the
contacting surfaces. If we assume that the roughness is

When the surface is moving against each other along the
y-axis, the spatial separation along this direction is cor-
related at a later time determined as ∆/v. This consid-
eration leads to

where S is a strength factor.

Applying Eq. (10), the intensity ﬁeld can be calcu-
lated. The procedure is to substitute Eqs. (6) and (8)
into Eq. (4), then calculate Eq. (9) by taking into ac-
count of Eq. (10). We ﬁnally get

A few general features can be observed from the spec-
tral formula. First, the strength factor S controls the

on a few parameters of the surfaces, such as the fric-
tion coeﬃcients and the mechanical properties of the
surfaces. Second, due to the factor sin(kmnL) in the
denominator of Qn, the resonance feature is expected
to appear when sin(kmnL) = 0,
leading to the phe-
nomenon of tonal sounds. This also shows that the thick-
ness mainly deﬁnes the resonance feature. Next, the
rubbing speed v enters Qn in the form of ω/v in the
denominator. For a ﬁxed frequency, the decreasing of
moving speed will reduced the strength of Qn. There-
fore with decreasing speed, high frequency components
tend to decay accordingly. Furthermore, since kmn =
(ω/cs)2 − (mπ/W )2 − (nπ/H)2, the cut-oﬀ frequen-
cies are determined by (ω/cs)2 − (mπ/W )2 − (nπ/H)2 ≥
p
0. These features comply with the intuition or experi-
ence. It is apparent that the present model can be ex-
tended to consider other rubbing surfaces, by adjusting
the correlation function of the surface stress. All these
features deduced from the theory tend to support the ex-
perimental observation of the sound generated by ice-ﬂoe
rubbing[2]. We note that the experimental results have
been interpreted by an alternative model [4].

To quantify our discussion, let us consider an example.
Suppose that W = H, L = 0.1W , and S is a constant.
Two moving speeds are considered: v/cs = 1/600 and
1/300. As an example, we compute the sound ﬁeld lo-

cated at (L, W/2, 0). The frequency spectra for the two
moving speed are presented in Fig. 2. The units are arbi-
trary. Here it is clearly shown that there is indeed a cut-
oﬀ frequency at about 200 for the lower speed curve. Also
for the lower speed case, the discussed resonance feature
does appear. For the higher moving speed, the spectrum
is broader. But the resonance tends to be weaker. And
the cut-oﬀ frequency is larger (not shown). Compared

to the lower speed case, the frequency band is obviously
broader. All these support the above qualitative analysis.
In summary, a model is established to investigate the
sound generated by rubbing two objects. In the model,
we have assumed that the contacting surfaces are rough
and the roughness is described as completely random.
The dependence of the frequency spectrum on the moving
speed and sample geometries is discussed. The results
seem to be in line with intuition or experience.

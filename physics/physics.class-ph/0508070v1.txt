Abstract

In the present work, the classical behavior of an electric dipole in presence of an external uniform

magnetic ﬁeld is studied. We have derived equations and constants of motion from the Lagrangian

formulation. We have obtained an inﬁnitely periodic eﬀective potential which describes a rotary

motion. The problem is not directly separable in relative and center of mass variables; even though,

we are able to write the energy of the system in terms of the relative variable. We deﬁne another

constant of motion which couples the relative with the center of mass variables. We describe

conditions for bound states of the dipole. Also, we discuss the problem in the approximation of

small oscillations. Finally, we have found a family of trapped states in a region of the space where

there is no classical turning point.

INTRODUCTION

Much attention has been paid to fundamental elements of molecular scale machinery[1,

2, 3, 4, 5, 6] due to the development of nanotechnology. An alternating electric ﬁeld is

used to explore electronic structures, however this process can be addressed to exchange

the orientation of molecules; so, it is posible to obtain some controlled molecular motion by

oscillating electric ﬁelds[3]. Devices on the molecular level are obtained from the conversion

of energy into controlled motion; regardless of this, it is diﬃcult to repeat this process in a

mechanical molecular motor, they are very common in biological systems[4]. The physical

principle for a molecular motor level can be eﬀectively found in the study of dynamics of

rotors in two dimensions as electric dipoles in a magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, owing to the scale

of the system this problem is actually a quantum problem.

In order to motivate undergraduate students to understand this kind of systems, we

proposed to introduce a description of the classical dynamics of rotors such as an electric

dipole in an external magnetic ﬁeld. Such problem can be included as an interesting topic in

a standard course of classical mechanics. That case is a many-body problem and its exact

analysis requires a diﬃcult treatment and the further useful understanding that is obtained

by approximations.

Some important remarks about dynamics of charges in oscillating electric and magnetic

ﬁeld was recently reported[7]. In addition to this, the behavior of a particle possessing a

permanent or induced electric dipole moment and interacting with external electromagnetic

ﬁelds was described. For a special conﬁguration of the ﬁelds, a quantum eﬀect is obtained

for a moving dipole. The experimental observation of this eﬀect is within reach of atom or

molecular interferometry[8].

It is well known that, the two-body is the simplest many-body system. In general, this

kind of problems can be separated in two problems of a single body. The case of two equal

charges in an external magnetic ﬁeld can be separated in two independent variables; the

motion of the center of mass and the motion of the relative coordinates. In fact, the problem

is separable in such motions. Classical[9] and quantum[10] mechanics of this problem was

discussed in details. The repulsive eﬀect is induced by the Coulomb interaction and the

conﬁnement eﬀect by the magnetic ﬁeld.

In a previous work, the two-body system of noncoupled arbitrary masses and opposite

2

charges into a magnetic ﬁeld is discussed. These equations can not be separated in two

independent variables as before; however, two constants of motion are obtained which permit

to write one equation for the energy in terms of the relative variable and the other equation

which couples the relative variable and the coordinate of the center of mass. Classical[9]

and quantum[11] results have been reported.

In the present work, we introduce a model for an electric dipole as two coupling particles

with equal and opposite charges and arbitrary masses. Firstly, we present a the general

formulation for the electric dipole in magnetic ﬁeld. We deﬁne the Lagrangian function,

constants and equations of motion, and also Hamiltonian function. Secondly, we present

the solution for a particular problem; this is, the planar motion of an electric dipole in a

perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. Rotary and bound states are discussed. Finally, we summarize

the formulation and main results.

GENERAL FORMULATION

Let us consider the motion of the two charges of the dipole in the presence of a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld given by a vector potential ~A with the position ~r1(~r2), the velocity ˙~r1( ˙~r2) and

the mass m1(m2) related to the particle 1(2). In our model, the two charges of the dipole

are held together by internal coupling and the Coulomb interaction between the charges

comes to be constant. Its application to the two charges of the dipole leads to the following

Lagrangian

where κ is the dielectric constant of the medium in which the motion of the dipole occurs.

Now, we go to carry from positions ~r1 and ~r2 to relative position ~r = ~r2 − ~r1 and the center
of mass position ~R = (m1~r1 + m2~r2)/M. Let us consider that the vector potential ~A is a
vector homogeneus function of the ~ζ × ~B of degree one, where ~ζ is a vector related to a
position vector and ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld. The Lagrangian function can be expressed as

where M = m1 +m2 is the mass of the center of mass and µ = m1m2/M is the reduced mass.

In fact, in contrast to the case of two identical particles; now, the present Lagrangian function

3

is similar to particles with opposite charges because it is a nonseparable problem; the motion

of the center of mass is coupled to the relative variable[9]. The conjugate momenta for the

center of mass is given by

A particular case has been discussed in Ref.[12], where the motion of the center of mass of

the dipole was restricted to the Z direction and rotational degrees of freedom of the dipole

to the XY plane. The magnetic ﬁeld was conﬁned to the Y direction. Hence, the classical

behaviour of the system can be recovered from basic equation of the present formulation.

MOTION IN A PERPENDICULAR PLANE

We are going to choose the most natural motion of electric charges in magnetic ﬁelds.

We consider a conﬁning motion to two dimensions in a perpendicular plane to the magnetic

ﬁeld.

In this way, we restrict the degrees of freedom of the center of mass to the plane

XY, the direction of the uniform magnetic ﬁeld is chosen to be in the direction Z, this is,
~B = B ˆz. The separation between charges is constant and |~r| = a is the linear size of the

dipole.

Let us use the symmetric gauge

~A(~r) =

~B × ~r,

and let us deﬁne variables and parameters in terms of the dimensionless units: ~ρ = ~r/a ,
~ξ = ~R/a, ˙~ρ = ˙~r/ωca,
2Ma2ωc
˙θc = ˙θ/ωc
, where ωc = eB/Mc is the cyclotron frequency and a is the size of a dipole. We deﬁne
εc ≡ e2/E0κa as the ratio between the Coulomb energy and magnetic energy. In summary,

˙~R/ωca, if E0 = 1

2, then ε = E/E0,

˙ϕc = ˙ϕ/ωc,

˙~ξ =

distances have been deﬁned in terms of a and the time in term of 1/wc.

Replacing Eq.(13) in Eq.(5) and considering the dimensionless parameters and variables,

we obtain a dimensionless expression given by

where ~Υ is a vector constant of motion and ~ρ is a position in the perpendicular plane XY

to the magnetic ﬁeld. We write the energy as a dimensionless equation

FIG. 1: An illustrative picture is shown for the angle Ψ. In addition, other parameters related to

the geometry of the dipole are depicted.

The Eq.(14) permits us to write the energy as a function of a single variable; this is,

The dimensionless eﬀective potential is given by

ε =

Vef = (~ρ − ~Υ)2 − εc.

The linear size of the dipole is the unit of the distance; thus, |~ρ| = 1,

Vef = 1 + ~Υ2 − 2Υ cos(Ψ) − εc,

(16)

(17)

(18)

where Ψ represents the angle between the line that joins the charges of the dipole and the
vector constant ~Υ. Thus, the eﬀective potential Vef is periodic function of Ψ.

In the Fig.(1), angle Ψ, dimensionless relative variable and the velocity of the center of

mass are depicted for a ﬁxed time.

Bound states

According to the previous considerations, we know that the eﬀective potential is a periodic

function that depends on Ψ. If the energy of the system is between two extreme values,

6

then there exist bound states, given by V min

ef = ((1 + Υ)2 − εc).
In this way, diﬀerent privileged orientations of the dipole are observed as a result of several

ef = ((1 − Υ)2 − εc) and V max

initial conditions in bound states.

Hence, from the Eq.(16) and by considering that ˙~ρ = dΨ/dτ ˆΨ, we have obtained by

A typical oscillation of the variable Ψ for bound states represents a bound rotation

between two angles. The angles are limited to an interval, whose extremes are given by

Ψ±

ε = ± arccos(

),

The motion of the dipole is an oscillation due to the existence of bound states. From the

Eq.(16) the amplitud of oscillation is determined by the energy of the system. According

to the Eq.(7), the energy depends on the initial orientation of the dipole. From the Eq.(19)

and the Eq.(21) the period of the motion can be given by

Which can be written in terms of a complete elliptic integral of the ﬁrst kind by an expression

given by

FIG. 2: The frequency is depicted as a function of energy ε + εc. The exact value for the frequency

coincides with the value in the aproximation of small oscillations in the limit ε → −εc

Clearly, this frequency depends on Υ, which corresponds to the initial orientation and the

initial velocity of the center of mass from the Eq.(8).

In the Fig.2 is depicted the relation between the dimensionless frequency and the dimen-

sionless energy. In the approximation of small oscillations, we get the eﬀective potential as

a quadratic function of the angle Ψ. This is, the period of such oscillations is independent

of their amplitude. The exact value for the frequency ω for ε + εc → 0 approaches to the

analytical value for the frequency ωP from small oscillations.

The classical trapped state corresponds to the case when the mean value of the velocity

That condition represents a closed motion. A particular solution is trivial and it can be
obtained from the Eq.(14) for ~ρ = ~Υ. It corresponds to a case where the projection of the

If the radius ξ is constant, the motion would correspond to a circular motion of the center

of mass of the dipole. As the dipole is ﬁxed to the orbit and the relative variable is constant
˙~ρ = 0, but this does not mean that the dipole is in rest, the dipole has an intrinsic rotation.

Now, in the limit ξ → 0 and Υ → 1; in the space, we obtain a pure rotation of the dipole;

thus,

The frequency of the rotation is the Larmor frequency that depends on the magnitud of the

magnetic ﬁeld. The single motion of the dipole is ﬁxed to a circular motion of the center of

mass, it corresponds to a pure rotation of the relative variable. This motion is a classical

trapped state of the center of mass out of the eﬀective potential with no classical turning

points. This approach suggests the existence of a rotor to level of a molecular motor. The

frequency of such rotor can be controlled by the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld.

SUMMARY

A dipole in an external ﬁeld is a very well known problem. So as the combination of

a magnetic dipole in magnetic ﬁeld as electric dipole in electric ﬁeld; even, the magnetic

dipole in electric ﬁeld have been well discussed. However, the problem of an electric dipole

in external magnetic ﬁeld has had a little dedication and discussion in the literature; then,

we think this approach ﬁlls such necessity.

Our treatment does not consider radiation eﬀects; however, the solution is nontrivial,

therefore we believe the present discussion would be pedagogically useful in topics of a

standard course of classical mechanics.

Our present application has considered the motion in a perpendicular plane to the mag-

netic ﬁeld. The motion axis concides with the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. In the present

9

view, bound states are obtained for a periodic potential with initial conditions which satisfy

Eq.(14) and Eq.(15). Rotary states can be obtained from the trapped motion in a point

of the space of the center of mass with initial conditions which satisfy Eq.(26); therefore,

motion of the dipole is turned to a pure rotation.

Finally, the general formulation of the present model can be used to study other problems

with diﬀerent initial conditions.

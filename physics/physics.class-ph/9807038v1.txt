Abstract

New, gauge-independent, second order Lagrangian for the motion of classical, charged test
particles is proposed. It diﬀers from the standard, gauge-dependent, ﬁrst order Lagrangian
by boundary terms only. A new method of deriving equations of motion from ﬁeld equations
is developed. When applied to classical electrodynamics, this method enables us to ob-
tain unambiguously the above, second order Lagrangian from the general energy-momentum
conservation principle.

1 Introduction

The motion of classical, charged test particles, in the classical Maxwell ﬁeld is derived usually
from the gauge-dependent Lagrangian function

and vk := ˙qk (we use the Heaviside-Lorentz system of units with the velocity of light c = 1).

Since the Lorentz force euµfµν derived from this Lagrangian is perfectly gauge invariant, it
is not clear, why we have to use the gauge-dependent interaction term euµAµ, with no direct
physical interpretation. Moreover, in this approach equations of motion are not uniquely implied
by ﬁeld equations. As an example, non-linear forces of the type uµf µλuκ
λfκν cannot be a priori
excluded.

equal to the amount of the angular-momentum of the ﬁeld, which is acquired by our physical sys-
tem, when the (boosted) Coulomb ﬁeld f (y,u)
, accompanying the particle moving with constant
velocity u through the space-time point y = (t, q), is added to the background (external) ﬁeld.
More precisely: the total energy-momentum tensor corresponding to the sum of the background
ﬁeld fµν and the above Coulomb ﬁeld f (y,u)
decomposes in a natural way into a sum of 1) terms
quadratic in fµν, 2) terms quadratic in f (y,u)
and 3) mixed terms. The quantity M int
µν is equal to
µν
this part of the total angular-momentum Mµν, which we obtain integrating only the mixed terms
of the energy-momentum tensor. It is proportional to the particle’s electric charge e contained

in the particle’s Coulomb ﬁeld. The interaction Lagrangian

which is obviously orthogonal to the four-velocity uµ. Therefore, it has only three independent
components. In the particle’s rest frame we have Q0 = 0 and the three-vector eQk equals to the
amount of the static moment acquired by the system when the particle’s own ﬁeld is added to
the background (external) ﬁeld. Hence, we have from (3) and (4):

We prove in Section 2 that, for a given external ﬁeld fµν , the new interaction Lagrangian
(5) diﬀers from the old one by (gauge-dependent) boundary corrections only. Hence, both
Lagrangians generate the same physical theory (although the new Lagrangian is of second dif-
ferential order, its dependence upon the second derivatives is linear; this implies that the corre-
sponding Euler – Lagrange equations of motion are of the second order). The relation between L
and
is, therefore, analogous to the one well known in General Relativity: the gauge-invariant,
second order Hilbert Lagrangian for Einstein equations may be obtained starting from the ﬁrst
order, gauge-dependent Lagrangian and supplementing it by an appropriate boundary term.

L

At this point, our result can be summarized as follows: a physical interpretation of the inter-
action Lagrangian euµAµ has been found. Up to boundary terms, it is equal to the interaction-
angular-momentum aµuνM int
µν . The question arises whether such an identity is a pure coincidence
or is a result of a universal law of physics.

In the second part of the paper (Sections 3 – 5) we try to convince the reader that the second
conjecture is correct. In fact, we propose a new method of deriving equations of motion from
ﬁeld equations. The method is based on an analysis of the geometric structure of generators of
the Poincar´e group, related with any special-relativistic, lagrangian ﬁeld theory. This analysis
leads us to a simple theorem, which we call “variational principle for an observer” (see Section
3). Applying this observation to the speciﬁc case of classical electrodynamics, we show how
to derive, in principle, equations of motion from ﬁeld equations. This derivation is based on a
following heuristic idea: a point-like particle has to be understood as an approximation of an
extended particle, i. e. of an exact, stable, soliton-like solution of a hypothetical theory of matter

2

ﬁelds interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld. To prove that the Maxwell theory (describing the
free ﬁeld outside of the “soliton’s strong-ﬁeld-core”) implies equations of motion for the solitons
themselves, we need several qualitative assumptions of heuristic nature, about their stability.
Under these assumptions the gauge-invariant Lagrangian describing the motion of point particles
is unambiguously derived from the general invariance principles of the theory.

The mathematical status of the above derivation is, therefore, similar to the Einstein – Infeld
– Hoﬀmann derivation of equations of motion from ﬁeld equations in General Relativity. It does
not depend upon a particular model which we take for the description of the gravitating body
under consideration (e. g. a hydrodynamical or an elastomechanical model). The derivation
is valid for any stable body and enables us to describe (in a good approximation) its motion
in a model-independent way, as a geodesic motion of a point-particle. Hence, even if we have
at the moment no realistic mathematical theory describing the interior of a star and fulﬁlling
all the necessary assumptions, we can expect that the above equations of motion are valid for
relatively stable objects. The present paper shows that a similar argumentation is possible also
in electrodynamics: Lorentz force acting on test particles does not need to be postulated as an
independent physical law, but is implied by the geometry of Maxwell ﬁeld, provided one accepts
the existence of the hypothetical fundamental theory of matter ﬁelds, admitting suﬃciently
stable soliton-like solutions.

The above result follows immediately from the consistent theory of interacting particles and
ﬁelds (cf. [1], [2]), called Electrodynamics of Moving Particles. All the formulae of the present
paper can be derived directly from the above theory in the test particle limit (i.e. m
0
with the ratio e/m being ﬁxed). The present paper, however, does not rely on this, much more
general, context. The consistent theory of test particles is constructed independently.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains a direct proof that our new Lagrangian
diﬀers from the standard, gauge-dependent one by boundary terms only. Section 3 contains our
basic geometric observation concerning any relativistic, Lagrangian ﬁeld theory, which makes
our approach possible. Using it, we give in Sections 4 and 5 the derivation of our variational
principle. In particular, the renormalization procedure deﬁned in Section 5 depends upon the
stability assumptions (which may be relatively diﬃcult to check for any speciﬁc mathematical
model). Accepting these assumptions on a heuristic level we obtain our theory of point particles
uniquely, as a necessary consequence of energy-momentum conservation.

In a forthcoming paper we are going to present the gauge-invariant Hamiltonian structure

of the above theory.

2 Equivalence between the two variational principles

The easiest way to prove the equivalence consists in rewriting the ﬁeld fµν in terms of the
electric and the magnetic induction, using a special accelerated reference system, adapted to
the particle’s trajectory ζ, which we deﬁne in the sequel. The system will be also very useful to
formulate our “variational principle for an observer” in the next Section.

We begin with any laboratory coordinate system (yµ) = (y0, yk) in Minkowski space-time
M and parameterize the trajectory ζ with the laboratory time t = y0. Let yk = q(t) be
the corresponding coordinate description of ζ. At each point of the trajectory we choose an
orthonormal tetrad (eµ), such that its element e0 is tangent to ζ, i. e. is equal to the four-velocity
vector u. Take now the unique boost transformation relating the laboratory time axis ∂/∂y0

3

with the observer’s time axis e0. We deﬁne the vector ek by transforming the corresponding
∂/∂yk – axis of the laboratory frame by the same boost.

It is easy to check (cf. [2]) that the above deﬁnition implies the following, explicit formula:

ek =

The above formula may be used as a starting point of the entire proof. To rewrite ﬁeld equa-
tions with respect to this system we need to calculate the components of the ﬂat Minkowskian
metric in our new coordinates. We see from (7) that, for a given value t, parameters (xk) are
cartesian coordinates on the 3-dimensional hyperplane Σt, orthogonal to ζ at the point (t, q(t)).
Hence, we get gkl = δkl for the space-space components of the metric.

The remaining information about the metric is carried by the lapse function and the shift

vector, which again may be easily calculated from formula (8):

The transformation (8) is not invertible. Coordinates (xk) are regular parameters on each
Σt. But hyperplanes Σt corresponding to diﬀerent values of t may intersect. Hence, the same
physical event may correspond to diﬀerent values of coordinates (t, xk).

Nevertheless, we may describe the free Maxwell ﬁeld in terms of our parameters (t, xk). In

particular, we have:

where Dk and Bk are the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld on each Σt, N and N m are given by
(9) and (10) (for the description of the Maxwell ﬁeld with respect to an accelerated reference
system see e. g. [3]).

Let us multiply (15) by xk

r3 and integrate this scalar product over Σt with respect to the
Lebesgue measure dx3. We ﬁrst integrate over the exterior of the sphere S(r0). Observe, that
in this region the following identity holds:

(A0(t, 0) is the only surface term which survives in the limit, due to the standard asymptotic
behaviour of the ﬁeld). Observe that the constant part of the lapse function (9) does not
produce any contribution to the right-hand side of the above formula, because the ﬂux of the
ﬁeld Dk through any sphere S(r) vanishes due to the Gauss law. Hence, we may replace “N ”

3 Variational principle for an observer

Consider any relativistic-invariant, Lagrangian ﬁeld theory (in this paper we will consider mainly
Maxwell electrodynamics, but the construction given in the present Section may be applied to
any scalar, spinor, tensor or even more general ﬁeld theory). Choose any non-inertial observer,
moving along a time-like trajectory ζ. We want to describe the ﬁeld evolution with respect to
the observer’s rest frame. For this purpose we choose the space-time parameterization deﬁned
in the previous Section.

The ﬁeld evolution with respect to the above non-inertial reference frame is a superposition

of the following three transformations:

time-translation in the direction of the local time-axis of the observer,

boost in the direction of the acceleration ak of the observer,

purely spatial O(3)-rotation ωm.

It is, therefore, obvious that the ﬁeld-theoretical generator of this evolution is equal to

frame angular momentum. The factor √1
v2 in front of the generator is necessary, because
the time t = x0, which we used to parameterize the observer’s trajectory, is not the proper
time along ζ but the laboratory time. For any point (t, q(t))
ζ the values of the Poincar´e
generators
, Rk and Sm are given as integrals of appropriate components of the ﬁeld energy-
momentum tensor over any space-like Cauchy surface Σ which intersects ζ precisely at (t, q(t))
(due to Noether’s theorem, the integrals are independent upon the choice of such a surface).
These values are, therefore, equal to the components of the total four-momentum pµ and the
total angular momentum Mµν of the ﬁeld, calculated in the observer’s co-moving frame eµ,
i.e.

E
Given a ﬁeld conﬁguration, we are going to use the quantity H as a second order Lagrangian
for the observer’s trajectory. For this purpose let us ﬁrst choose a “reference trajectory” ζ0.
Next, for each point (t, q(t))
ζ0 let us calculate the corresponding “reference values” of the
(t), Rk(t), Sm(t) and insert them into H. Finally, consider the function (23) obtained
generators
this way as a Lagrangian depending upon a generic trajectory ζ via its velocity v and acceleration

Theorem
Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the above Lagrangian are automatically satisﬁed by the
trajectory ζ = ζ0.

This theorem was derived in [2] in a much more general framework. Within this framework,
it was an obvious consequence of the invariance of the theory with respect to the choice of an
H” was proved to be a Routhian function playing the
observer. More precisely, the function “
role of the Lagrangian with respect to the observer’s degrees of freedom and the Hamiltonian
(with opposite sign) with respect to the ﬁeld degrees of freedom. For purposes of the present
paper we do not need, however, this larger context. The Theorem may be checked by simple
inspection: Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the second order Lagrangian (23) are au-
tomatically satisﬁed as a consequence of the ﬁeld energy-momentum and angular-momentum
conservation (this direct proof was also given in [2]).

4 Adding a test particle to the ﬁeld

From now on we limit ourselves to the case of electrodynamics. This means that the ﬁeld energy-
momentum and angular-momentum are deﬁned as appropriate integrals of the components of
the Maxwell energy-momentum tensor

Suppose now that to a given background ﬁeld fµν we add a test particle carrying an electric
charge e. Denote by f (y,u)
the (boosted) Coulomb ﬁeld accompanying the particle moving with
constant four-velocity u, which passes through the space-time point y. Being bi-linear in ﬁelds,
the energy-momentum tensor T total of the total ﬁeld

µν

f total
µν

:= fµν + f (y,u)

µν

may be decomposed into three terms: the energy-momentum tensor of the background ﬁeld
T f ield, the Coulomb energy-momentum tensor T particle, which is composed of terms quadratic
in f (y,u)
µν

and the “interaction tensor” T int, containing mixed terms:

T total = T f ield + T particle + T int .

Unfortunately, T total does not lead any longer to a globally conserved quantity, as in the case
of a relativistic invariant ﬁeld theory. Indeed, the relativistic invariance has been broken by the
choice of the electric current localized on the trajectory. Moreover, due to the Coulomb ﬁeld’s
singularity, integrals which would have been necessary to obtain the generator (23) from (26)
are ill deﬁned. Hence, techniques introduced in Section 3 cannot be used directly.

For reasons which will be fully explained in the next Section, we replace (23) by the following,
well deﬁned, “renormalized” quantity. To obtain this quantity we will integrate ﬁrst two terms
of (26) over any Σ which passes through y = (t, q(t)). Integration of T f ield (no singularity) and
T int (an r−
2 – singularity) is possible and gives well deﬁned quantities, which we call respectively
H f ield (“background ﬁeld generator”) and H int (“interaction generator”). Because the left-hand
side and the ﬁrst two terms of the right-hand side of (26) have a vanishing divergence (outside
of the particle’s trajectory), we conclude that also T int has a vanishing divergence. This implies,
that the above integrals are invariant with respect to changes of Σ, provided the intersection
point with the trajectory does not change (see [1] for more details).

(28)

(30)

Unfortunately, the Coulomb tensor T particle has an r−

4 singularity at y and cannot be in-
tegrated. According to the renormalization procedure deﬁned in [2] and sketched brieﬂy in
the next Section, we replace its integrals by the corresponding components of the total four-
momentum of the particle: pparticle
= 0. We
deﬁne, therefore, the renormalized particle generator as follows:

= muλ and the total angular momentum: M particle

Consequently, we deﬁne the total (already renormalized) generator as a sum of three terms

where the ﬁrst term is quadratic and the second term is linear with respect to the background
ﬁeld fµν.

Let us observe that the only non-vanishing term in H int comes from the static moment
term R in (23), because the mixed terms in both the energy
and the angular momentum S
vanish when intergated over any Σ. The easiest way to prove this fact consists in choosing the
hypersurface Σt which is orthogonal to the velocity u at (t, q(t)), i.e. the rest-frame surface
(our integrals do not depend upon the choice of a hypersurface). On this surface, the Coulomb
ﬁeld f (y,u)
is spherically symmetric and carries, therefore, only the monopole component. On
the other hand, the monopole component of the background ﬁeld fµν vanishes as a consequence
of the homogeneous Maxwell equations (no charges!). The mixed term in the energy integral
is, therefore, a product of a monopole-free functions and the pure monopole. Hence, it vanishes
after integration. A similar argument applies to the angular momentum S.

In particular, using the particle’s rest-frame and integrating over the rest-frame hypersurface

Σt we obtain formula (19) for M int
k0 .

As we have already mentioned, the quantity H total

ren deﬁned this way, cannot be directly used
in the framework of pure electrodynamics, as the “observer’s Lagrangian”. In the next Section
we will show, however, that this quantity provides a good approximation of the total generator
H within a more general framework. In this framework particles are no longer point-like, but
are extended objects, described by matter ﬁelds interacting with electrodynamics. We will
conclude, that within this approximation our “renormalized generator” may be used to derive
an “approximative trajectory” of such extended objects.

5 Renormalization. Derivation of equations of motion from ﬁeld

equations

According to the approach developed in [1] and [2] we treat the moving particle as a solution of
a hypothetical “fundamental theory of matter ﬁelds interacting with electromagnetic ﬁeld”. We

8

assume that such a theory is a relativistic, Lagrangian (possibly highly non-linear) ﬁeld theory.
Moreover, we assume linear Maxwell theory as a limiting case of the above theory, corresponding
to suﬃciently weak electromagnetic ﬁelds and vanishing matter ﬁelds.

We will suppose that the particle, whose interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld we are
going to analyze, is a global solution of the above ﬁeld theory, having following qualitative
properties:

1. it contains a tiny “strong ﬁeld region”, concentrated in the vicinity of a time-like trajectory

ζ, which we may call an approximate trajectory of the extended particle,

2. outside of this strong ﬁeld region the matter ﬁelds vanish (or almost vanish in the sense,
that the following approximation remains valid) and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is suﬃciently
weak to be described by linear Maxwell equations.

To be more precise, we imagine the “particle at rest” as a stable, static, soliton-like solution
of our hypothetical “super theory”. The solution is characterized by two parameters: its total
charge e and its total energy m. The energy is not concentrated within the interior of the particle
but contains also the part of the energy carried by its “Coulomb tail”. This means that m is
an already renormalized mass, (or dressed mass), including the energy of the ﬁeld surrounding
the particle. Within this framework questions like “how big the bare mass of the particle is and
which part of the mass is provided by the purely electromagnetic energy?” are meaningless. In
the strong ﬁeld region (i. e. inside the particle) the energy density may be highly non-linear and
there is probably no way to divide it consistently into two such components.

Due to relativistic invariance of the theory, there is a 6 parameter family of the “uniformly

moving particle” solutions obtained from our soliton via Poincar´e transformations.

Now, an arbitrarily moving particle is understood as a “perturbed soliton”. This means that
it is again an exact solution of the same “super theory”, with its strong-ﬁeld-region concentrated
in the vicinity of a time-like world line ζ, which is no longer a straight line, as it was for “uniformly
moving particles”. Let us choose an observer who follows this “approximate trajectory” ζ. We
know that he automatically satisﬁes the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the second order
, Rk and Sm are the quantities calculated for the complete non-linear
Lagrangian (23), where
theory.

E

Suppose now, that the particle may be treated as a test particle. This means, that the total
ﬁeld outside of the particle does not diﬀer considerably from a background ﬁeld f , satisfying
homogeneous Maxwell equations. Using this hypothesis we may approximate, for each point
(t, q(t)), the exact value of (23) by the value of (29).
Indeed, we may decompose the total
energy-momentum tensor of the complete non-linear ﬁeld as follows:

As a result, we obtain the ﬁrst two terms of (29). On the other hand, integrating the last term
T in (31) we obtain without any approximation the corresponding value of the four-momentum
of the particle. This way we reproduce the last term of (29).

Replacing (23) by its approximate value (29) and using the Theorem we conclude that the
trajectory ζ has to fulﬁll Euler-Lagrange equations derived from (29). Applying the Theorem to
the linear Maxwell theory we conclude, that the term H f ield produces Euler-Lagrange equations
which are automatically fulﬁlled by ζ. Hence, we may drop out this term, leaving only the
remaining two terms. They ﬁnally give us our formula (3) for the Lagrangian of the test particle
(the sign has to be changed because as a Lagrangian we should have taken “
H” instead of
“H” – see remark at the end of Section 3).

Abstract

A high-school exercise is used to get an insight into planetary motion.

Introduction: some history

Science contests for high-school students have a hundred-years-old tradition in Hungary. The
ﬁrst one, open to students who just completed their high-school cursus, was organized in 1894
to honor L. E¨otv¨os, who had beeen appointed Minister of Education. The early prize-winners
include such outstanding future scientists as L. Fej´er, Th. von K´arm´an, A. Haar, . . . followed by
many others. In 1916 a physics contest was held for the ﬁrst time – and L. Szil´ard came second.
In 1925, E. Teller got the ﬁrst prize in physics and, jointly with L. Tisza, also in mathematics.
They became friends; later Tisza changed from mathematics to physics, and published his very
ﬁrst paper jointly with Teller. Their friendship lasted until Teller’s recent death. In the late
twenties, von Neumann and Szil´ard even suggested that the university examinations could be
replaced by such a contest [1]. The tradition still continues, and contributes to forming future
generations of scientists [2].

The problems of the contest require imagination and creative thinking rather than lexical
knowledge – and can, in some cases, lead to genuine research. A famous example is that of
A. Cs´asz´ar who, as a young assistent, was called to survey the contest. While the high-school
students were working on the problem, Cs´asz´ar ﬁgured out a generalization and published a
paper on it.

Also some of the physics problems deserve further thinking. An exercise of the 1969 contest,
for example, asked the following. A spacecraft moves on a circular trajectory of radius r = 4000
km around a planet of radius R = 3600 km. Then, for a short time, the rocket engins (directed
oppositely to its motion), are switched on. This puts the spacecraft onto an elliptic trajectory,
which touches the planet’s surface at the opposite point of the trajectory. Which proportion of
its kinetic energy went lost ?

The problem can be solved using elementary methods alone [2]. It is, however, instructive

to describe it also using diﬀerent, more sophisticated, methods.

1

From a physical point of view, we have the following situation. As the engine works for a
very short time, the position of the spacecraft does not change considerably. Owing to its loss of
velocity, the gravitational attraction wins the race and pulls the circular trajectory more tight :
the trajectory becomes an ellipse with major axis 2a = r + R. Our task amounts to comparing
the kinetic energies of the two types of motions in the same (aphelium) point.

r

R

Figure 1: Reducing the velocity puts the spacecraft onto an elliptic trajectory. The relative loss
of energy is the numerical excentricity of the new orbit.

The clue is to establish the following statement: The ratio of the [aphelium] kinetic energies
of the two types of motion is the perihelium-distance divided by the major semi-axis of the
elliptical motion,

Then the answer to the originally asked question follows at once:

Now, as e = 1
R) is the excentricity, (2) is indeed ǫ = e/a : the relative loss
of energy is the numerical excentricity of the new orbit, i. e., the measure of the “ﬂattening” of
the circle. Let us observe that the answer only depends on the geometric dimensions. With the
given numerical data, we ﬁnd ǫ = 1/19.

Below we present several proofs of (1), ordered following their ever-increasing diﬃculty and

required background knowledge.

2 Demonstrations

As the answer is obviously independent of the mass of the spacecraft, we chose this latter to be
unity.

Proof I: using Kepler’s laws alone.

According to the laws of circular motion,

Then the application of Kepler’s third law to the elliptic motion yields the period of this latter,

The area of the ellipse is πab, where b is the minor semi-axis. b2 = √a2

e2 = √rR, the
area is hence π(R + r)√rR/2. The areal velocity, which is constant by Kepler’s second law, is
therefore

which implies (1).

Proof II: Using the conservation of the energy and of the angular momentum.

Denoting the aphelium and the perihelium velocities by va and vp, the conservation of the

energy and of the angular momentum requires that

Eliminating the perihelium velocity yields once again the kinetic energy (9).

Proof III: Using the formula of the total energy of planetary motion.

An important property of planetary motion [3, 5, 6] is that the total energy only depends

on the major axis, according to

Then it follows from the energy conservation that, in any point of the trajectory, the velocity
satisﬁes

For the circular motion, a = r, and for the elliptic a = (r + R)/2, respectively. Plugging this

into (13), yields (4) and (9), respectively.

Even more simply, observing that the change of the total energy is in fact that of the kinetic

energy since the potential energy is unchanged, using (12) we have

∆Ekin = ∆Etot = f M

Writing here, by (4), K kin

in place of f M/2r yields (2) directly.

It is worth noting that, in a point r of the trajectory, the ratio of the kinetic and the potential

energies is, by (13), Ekin/Epot = r/2a

1. We have therefore

which yields again (1).

Furthermore, while the total energy only depends on the major semi-axis, this is not so for
the parts taken individually by the kinetic and the potential energies. According to (15) we
have indeed

0 =

Etot
0 ,

Proof IV: The relation to Kepler’s third law.

Kepler’s third law is related to the behaviour of the system with respect to scaling [5] : if
r′ = λr,
some trajectory is dilated from the focus by λ- and the time is dilated by λ3/2, r
In those points which correspond to each
t
other, both the kinetic and the potential energies [and hence also the total energy] are related
as the inverse ratio of the geometric dimensions,

t′ = λ3/2t, yields again a possible trajectory.

Let us now retract our original circular motion so that is radius equals to the major semi-axis
2 (r + R)/r. By (17) the total
0 . This is, however, the same as the total
a , since the major semi-axes are equal. Hence once again

of our elliptic motion above, i.e., consider the dilation by λ = 1
energy [and consistently with (12)] is ˜Etot
energy of the elliptic motion, ˜Etot
a = 2r
Etot

0 . Then the result follows from (16).

0 = 2r

0 = Etot

r+R Etot

r+R Etot

Let us stress that Kepler’s third law did not suﬃce alone; we also needed the statement

about the total energy.

Proof V: Using the Frenet formulæ.

It is worth describing the motion using the moving local frame introduced by Fr´enet [7].
Then, for a trajectory of arbitrary shape, the normal component of the accelaration is v2/ρ
where ρ is the radius of curvature i. e., the radius of the osculating circle [7]. In an extremal
point of the ellipse the accelaration is normal, and points toward the focus. Hence

which generalizes the formula (3) of circular motion. For the circle ρ = r, so that

v2

since the force is the same for both problems. We have hence proved: The ratio of the kinetic
energies is therefore identical to that of the radii of curvature. In the extremal points of the
ellipse, ρ = b2/a = 2rR
r+R , which implies again (1). Using the explicit form, f M/r2, of the force,
(18) would allow us to calculate the velocity as

This is, however, not necessary for us: it was enough to know that the geometric dimensions of
the trajectory.

Proof VI: Using the “Runge-Lenz” vector.

A proof analogouos to that in II is obtained if we use the so called “Runge-Lenz” vector

[3, 4, 5, 6]

where L = r
radius vector drawn form the Earth’s center to the spacecraft’s position.

v is the conserved angular momentum; ˆr denotes the unit vector carried by the

Figure 2: The conserved Runge-Lenz vector is directed from the Earth’ center towards the peri-
helium position.

Diﬀerentiating K-t with respect to time shows that K is a constant of the motion. The
scalar product of K with L vanishes, so that K lies in the plane of the motion; it points from
the focus to the perihelium point K = K ˆbf e. Multiplying (21) with r yields the trajectory [3, 5]
as

r =

p
1 + ǫ cos θ

p =

L2
f M

ǫ =

K
f M

where θ is the angle between K and r. (22) reperesents a conic with parameter p and numerical
excentricity ǫ.

Returning to our problem, let us observe that in the extremal points

K = vpLˆe

f M ˆe =

vaLˆe + f M ˆe,

where ˆe is the unit vector directed from the center to the perihelium. The length of L is clearly
L = vprp = vara [cf. (11)]; eliminating the perihelium velocity,

For circular motion ra = rp = r yielding (4); for our elliptic motion rp = R, ra = r which

provides us again with (9), the kinetic energy in the aphelium.

Also, one could prove that

K 2 = f 2M 2 + 2EtotL2.

Hence K = f M ǫ which, together with (23) yields

Writing Ekin

for f M/r provides us again with (1) or (2).

3 Discussion

(25)

(26)

Let us summarize our various approaches. Our ﬁrst proof only used Kepler’s laws speciﬁc for
the planetary motion, and could have been obtained therefore before Newton’s time – or by a
high-school student. The second and six proof is based on conservation laws; the second uses
that of the energy and the angular momentum, and the last the Runge-Lenz vector. This is
early 19th century physics: the vector (21) was in fact introduced by Laplace in 1799, in his
Trait´e de M´ecanique C´eleste [3, 4, 6].

II, using high-school knowledge only, would clearly work for any conservative force, while VI
is related to the “hidden” symmetry of of the Kepler problem. The required knowledge goes
beyond standard university level, and leads to a group theoretical treatment [6]. For example,
K = 0 and (25) are the classical counterparts of the Casimir relations of the O(4) dynamical
L

·

symmetry used by Pauli to determine the spectrum of the hydrogen atom [6].

III and IV are based on the formula (12) of the total energy, discussed by university textbooks

[3, 5]. IV is linked to the scaling property which yields in fact Kepler’s third law [5].

Proof V uses the general framework of co-moving coordinates called the Fr´enet formulæ[7]
(late 19th century), which makes part of regular university courses on mechanics and/or diﬀer-
ential geometry. It can be applied to any central force problem: the reader is invited to work
kr (when the trajectories are again ellipses.)
out what happens, e, g., for a harmonic force F =
In conclusion, we believe that the various approaches presented above provided us with
an insight into the intricacies of planetary motion – and also into the origin of the succes of
Hungarian physicists in the twentieth century.

Abstract

This paper investigates Monte Carlo techniques for construction of compact
wavefunctions for the internal atomic motion of the D3O+ ion. The polar-
ization force ﬁeld models of Stillinger, et al. and of Ojamae, et al. were
used. Initial pair product wavefunctions were obtained from the asymptotic
high temperature many-body density matrix after contraction to atom pairs
using Metropolis Monte Carlo. Subsequent characterization shows these pair
product wavefunctions to be well optimized for atom pair correlations de-
spite that fact that the predicted zero point energies are too high. The pair
product wavefunctions are suitable to use within variational Monte Carlo, in-
cluding excited states, and density matrix Monte Carlo calculations. Together
with the pair product wavefunctions, the traditional variational theorem per-
mits identiﬁcation of wavefunction features with signiﬁcant potential for fur-
ther optimization. The most important explicit correlation variable found for
the D3O+ ion was the vector triple product rOD1·(rOD2×rOD3). Variational
Monte Carlo with 9 of such explicitly correlated functions yielded a ground
state wavefunction with an error of 5-6% in the zero point energy.

INTRODUCTION

Flexible and dissociative models for simulation of liquid water have often been used in
classical statistical mechanical studies of aqueous materials. [1–35] They present technical
advantages for carrying-out simulations and are of-the-essence where dissociation of water
molecules is necessary to the chemistry being studied. Studies of clusters suggest that quan-
tum mechanics plays a non-negligible role in proton transfer. [36] However, directly incorpo-
rating quantum mechanics via discretized path integral approaches may require one or more
orders of magnitude larger computational eﬀort. [37] This Report investigates constructing
simple intramolecular wavefunctions for aqueous species. These wavefunctions might be
used in Monte Carlo simulations of aqueous solutions with the same computational tech-
niques used to treat ﬂexible simulation models classically. More speciﬁcally, our goal is to
determine the complication and accuracy to be expected in constructing wavefunctions that
might be transferrable and useful in related studies of aqueous solution chemistry.

We take the deuterated hydronium ion, D3O+, as a speciﬁc example species. We choose
this ion because of the substantial current interest in proton exchange processes in water
and in the spectroscopy of charged clusters of water molecules; [1,23,35,36,38–40] we choose
the deuterated case to avoid the interesting complications of spin restrictions on the wave-
functions. In addition we will study here only states of zero angular momentum, J=0. Our
goal will be to obtain a simple intramolecular wavefunction for this species in a reasonably
organized fashion.

A traditional exhaustive expansion of the wavefunction into a basis will produce satis-
factory vibrational energies with eﬀort but is unlikely to produce a simple result for the
wavefunction. Less traditionally, diﬀusion Monte Carlo [41] will produce satisfactory vi-
brational energies for low energy states with eﬀort but not a simple wavefunction for other
uses.

In contrast, the historical work of McMillan [42], a variational Monte Carlo calculation
for the ground state of liquid He4, does directly center on the construction of a simple
wavefunction. The Monte Carlo character of this technique is limited to the primitive
but essential task of evaluating integrals with a many-body wavefunction. This approach
permits simple but sophisticated descriptions of correlation and can include a limited number
of excited states. The possibility of simultaneous treatment of excited states provides an
additional avenue for description of correlation. In fact, the density matrix Monte Carlo
approach [41,43–45] of recent years can be regarded as a generalization of the McMillan
calculation; the β=0 circumstance is precisely the result that we view as the McMillan
calculation with excited states.

The full power of the density matrix Monte Carlo approach can be used with rough
initial estimates of the wavefunctions sought. The Monte Carlo calculation systematically
improves the computed energy levels. However, since our goal is to derive a wavefunction
useful in other contexts, we emphasize ﬁnding and utilizing the best simple function we can
before the density matrix Monte Carlo procedure takes over.

We will initially use pair-product wavefuctions for atomic motion. The components of the
pair-product are obtained by diagonalizing an approximate density matrix. We emphasize
that initial models of a set of vibrational wavefunctions need not be orthonormal. The
possibility of using functions localized in diﬀerent conformational basins provides a well-

2

deﬁned analysis of zero-point eﬀects on conformational equilibria.

It is found (below) that these initial pair-product wavefunctions capture two body cor-
relations fairly well. Using them as a basis in McMillan and density matrix Monte Carlo
calculations incorporates further correlation eﬀects. To obtain more compact wavefunctions,
the variational principle is used to identify the important many-body correlations. These
eﬀects are included into the ground state wavefunction and yield a signiﬁcantly improved
simple wavefunction for the ground state. A few of these correlated wavefunctions can be
used as the basis in a McMillan calculation yielding reasonably accurate wavefunctions.

MODEL WAVEFUNCTIONS FOR ATOMIC MOTION

We develop the vibrational wavefunctions analogously to development of wavefunctions

for liquid He. We initially seek a pair product form

Φ0 =

φOD(rOD)

φDD(rDD) .

YOD pairs

YDD pairs

(1)

In this case, we expect the functions φOD to be local mode orbitals and the functions φDD
to serve as correlation functions.

The casual interpretation of these functions as orbitals will serve to distinguish vibra-
tional excitations. The method sketched here is based upon the observation that the eigen-
functions of the asymptotic β → 0 density matrix are suitable initial estimates of the pair
functions sought. This method has the additional advantage that harmonic analysis of a
potentially rough energy landscape is not required.

We start with a function of this simple form for several reasons. First, a similar distri-
bution is implied when ﬂexible and dissociative pair simulation models of water are treated
classically. Second, elements of such a form might be approximately transferrable to OD and
DD joint distributions in other settings - this would be the common assumption for simula-
tion calculations. Third, such a form would be similar, though not the same as a ground state
vibrational wavefunction for a harmonic system. The distinctions are that normal modes
coordinates are not used, and that functions employed can attempt to treat anharmonic sys-
tems by deviating from Gaussian form where the potential is anharmonic. The remainder
of this paper characterizes such wavefunctions and investigates some improvements.

Natural orbitals for general oscillators in one dimension

If the density matrix hx′; β|xi ≡< x′|e−βH|x > were known, its natural orbitals would

be obtained from

hx′; β|xiφn(x′)dx′ = e−βEnφn(x)

Z

In fact the asymptotic β → 0 limit of the density matrix is simple: [46]

hx′; β|xi = (m/2πβ¯h2)1/2 exp{−m(x − x′)2/2β¯h2 − β(V (x) + V (x′))/2} .

Sethia et al. showed that though the density matrix used is approximate, satisfactory orbital
functions are obtained. [47] This form for the thermal density matrix is more than merely

(2)

(3)

an approximation. For small β, it is asymptotically correct. Therefore, it is satisfactory if
the application permits a small β. The subsequent developments exploit this point.

Contraction to Pairs for the many-body Thermal Density Matrix

For higher dimensional problems, we can exploit the approximate density matrix to
produce the necessary reasonable pair functions after tracing-out all other degrees of freedom.
This tracing-out will be generally possible on the basis of classical Monte Carlo techniques.
Consider a system composed of N particles located at (r1, r2 . . . rN ). The N-body high-

temperature thermal density matrix is

hr1, r2 . . . rN ; β|r′

1, r′

2 . . . r′

N i =

(mk/2πβ¯h2)3/2 exp{−mk(rk − r′

k)2/2β¯h2}

× exp{−β(V (r1, r2 . . . rN ) + V (r′

1, r′

2 . . . r′

N ))/2} .

(4)

We now focus on the {ij} pair of particles. For all other particles, we restrict the density
matrix to the diagonal. For example, taking {ij}={12} we obtain

hr1, r2 . . . rN ; β|r′

1, r′

2 . . . rN i ∝

(mk/2πβ¯h2)3/2 exp{−mk(rk − r′

k)2/2β¯h2}

N

Yk=1

Yk=1,2

× exp{−β(V (r1, r2 . . . rN ) + V (r′

1, r′

2 . . . rN ))/2}.

(5)

where we have dropped some irrelevant multiplicative constants. Now for the {12} pair we
transform to the {12} center of mass and relative coordinates: R = (m1r1 +m2r2)/(m1 +m2)
and r = r1 − r2.

hR + m2r/M, R − m1r/M . . . rN ; β|R′ + m2r′/M, R′ − m1r′/M . . . rN i ∝

exp{−β(V (R + m2r/M, R − m1r/M . . . rN ) + V (R′ + m2r′/M, R′ − m1r′/M . . . rN ))/2}
(6)

× (M/2πβ¯h2)3/2 exp{−M(R − R′)2/2β¯h2}(µ/2πβ¯h2)3/2 exp{−µ(r − r′)2/2β¯h2}.

where we have used the notation M = m1 + m2 and µ = m1m2/M.

Note that R is not the molecular center of mass and that the potential generally does
depend on R. However, in the interest of simplicity and in view of the form sought Eq.
(1), we will trace-out the R dependence also. Our ﬁnal step will be to use classical Monte
Carlo techniques for the integrations required to bring Eq.
(6) into the form of Eq.(2)
for the relative coordinate r. Thus we sample conﬁgurations with the probability density
exp{−βV (r1, r2 . . . rN )} and we estimate the kernel

K(r, r′) ∝

e−µ(r1−r2−r′)2/2β¯h

where

δV (R + m2r′/M, R − m1r′/M . . . rN ) ≡

K(r, r′) is symmetric, though the formula Eq. (7) is asymmetric. For the case considered
here, it does not depend on the angles that r or r′ make with the laboratory ﬁxed coordinate

system. Thus, this kernel depends only on r, r′, and the angle between them. Since we here
focus on radial functions, we only need the kernel after having averaged over that polar
angle.

Note that for determination of the orbitals only, the normalization of the kernel K(r, r′)
is not signiﬁcant. To within an unimportant normalization constant we can evaluate the
required kernel through the following procedure:

1. Draw conﬁgurations (r1, r2 . . . rN ) from the probability distribution proportional to

exp{−βV (r1, r2 . . . rN )} utilizing the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm [48,49].

2. For each conﬁguration, choose an r′ from a grid and its corresponding spherical angles
θ′ and φ′ using quasi-random number series. Weight each conﬁguration (r1, r2 . . . rN )
and the corresponding r′ by

e−µ(r1−r2−r′)2/2β¯h

e−βδV ([m1r1+m2r2+m2r′]/M,[m1r1+m2r2−m1r′]/M ...rN ))/2

3. Perform a ﬁnal integration over angles

θ, φ, θ′, and φ′ are the spherical, angles corresponding to r and r′. For this case of
J = 0, it would have been suﬃcient to integrate over the angle between r and r′.

With this kernel in hand, we solve the one dimensional equation

K(R, R′)R′2φ(R′)dr′ = λφ(R) .

(11)

λ is not e−βE but is proportional to it.

This approach is not limited to the circumstances that one member of that pair is a
massive molecular center. This can be applied also for DD pairs in the D3O+ molecule.
However, for the D3O+ molecule in particular, it is natural to regard the OD functions as
local mode orbitals and the DD functions as providing a subsequent account of correlations.

D3O+ PAIR FUNCTIONS

The functions φOD and φDD are found for the second version of the Ojamae-
Shavitt-Singer (OSS) potential [35] using β−1=0.01 Hartree and a sample size of 500,000
(r1, r2 . . . rN ) conﬁgurations. This energy parameter is 6.3 kcal/mole (more than 3000 K), a
value above the D3O+ inversion barrier of 4.4 kcal/mole. Smaller values for β are problem-
atical because of the fragmentation of the D3O+ molecule at high temperatures.

Figure 1 shows φDD obtained. The additional approximation of ﬁxing one of the
deuterons in the reference bond has the signiﬁcant eﬀect of narrowing the pair function.
As expected, the eﬀect is not as dramatic for ﬁxing an oxygen atom. The co-linear assump-
tion of ﬁxing the orientation of the reference bond is not signiﬁcant.

5

These functions were also obtained for the Stillinger, Stillinger, Hogdgon (SSH) potential.
[50] A comparison of features of SSH and OSS is presented in Table I. The higher (more
realistic) binding energy for the additional proton in the SSH case and the higher inversion
barrier of this potential permits a smaller β.
In that case, the pair functions are found
for two values of 1/β, namely 0.01 Hartree and 0.01677. . . Hartree. The diﬀerence in the
“frequencies” associated with the ground and ﬁrst excited state OD “local mode” functions
changed from 3150 cm−1 to 1987 cm−1. The corresponding diﬀerences in DD frequencies
changed from 1243 cm−1 to 837 cm−1. In spite of these large frequency changes, the pair
functions, seen in Figure 2, are qualitatively similar.

ACCURACY OF THE PAIR PRODUCT WAVEFUNCTIONS

The numerical arrays describing the OD and DD functions were ﬁt to cubic splines with
ﬁrst derivatives set to zero at the end points [51] and the pair product wavefunctions of
Eq. (1) were obtained. Several steps were taken the assess the quality of these wavefunc-
tions. For the OSS and SSH potentials, the variational Monte Carlo [42] zero point energies
of the pair product wavefunctions are 0.0321(2) and 0.0367(6) Hartrees, respectively. Sim-
ple diﬀusion Monte Carlo [41] zero-point energies for the potentials are 0.02516(3) and
0.03042(3) Hartrees. (All errors are two standard deviations unless otherwise noted.) The
energy for the pair product function is between 20% and 30% too large. This function was
further optimized by introducing parameters to move (m) and scale (s) the pair functions;
φ(rnew) = φ((rold + m)/s). No signiﬁcant lowering of the energy was found.

The quality of optimization of these pair functions can be analyzed directly. The usual

variation principle can be expressed as

h(δ ln Ψ) EL(1..N)i|Ψ|

2 − h(δ ln Ψ)i|Ψ|

2 hEL(1..N)i|Ψ|

2 = 0 ,

(12)

where EL = Ψ−1HΨ is the usual local energy function and the subscripted brackets h. . .i|Ψ|
indicate an average with probability density |Ψ|2. For a pair product wavefunction this form
implies

ˆρ(2)
γν (r)EL(1..N)

ˆρ(2)
γν (r)

= 0 ,

(13)

where ˆρ(2)

γν (r) is the γν pair joint density operator.

This stationary requirement is satisﬁed for the exact ground state wavefunction since the
local energy is spatially constant. Any deviation of the left side of Eqn. 13 from zero will
be deﬁned as the optimization deﬁcit.

Figure 3 shows the optimization deﬁcit for the OSS DD pair functions and the DD VMC
radial distribution function. The OD functions show similar low optimization deﬁcits; these
pair functions lead to accurately uncorrelated pair densities and local energies and are thus
well optimized. Note that the largest deﬁcits are at the tails of the distribution. Thus further
optimization would require signiﬁcant eﬀort because of the diﬃculty of getting statistically
signiﬁcant data for those infrequent events.

CORRELATION BEYOND PAIRS: VARIATIONAL AND DENSITY MATRIX
MONTE CARLO

We can use model excited state functions to improve the ground state and get a few
low lying states at the same time. A concise expression of these approaches is obtained by
focusing on the density matrix. Suppose we have a number of approximate wavefunctions
|Φii, i = 0, . . . , N. By Monte Carlo procedures detailed elsewhere [43,44], we estimate the
matrix elements

and

ρij(β) ≡< Φi| exp{−βH}|Φj >,

H ij(β) ≡< Φi|H exp{−βH}|Φj >,

(14)

(15)

for β not too large. As β gets large, information is lost for highly excited states, so this
approach depends on location of an intermediate range of β. H and ρ are then diagonalized
simultaneously. The |Φii need not be orthonormal initially since Monte Carlo methods will
be used to perform the required integrations. The β → 0 limit may be viewed as a direct
extension of the McMillan [42] approach. The trace of ρij provides a natural importance
function for the Monte Carlo calculation.

To apply these methods to our problem, an ordered set of excited state functions is
obtained as follows. The ratio of eigenvalues of the nth function and the ground state,
δEpair
, are used to assign relative energies to the pair product functions. If a pair product
n
consists of one ground state and two ﬁrst excited states of OD interaction, and two ground
states, and a ﬁrst excited state of the DD interaction, the relative energy assigned to it
would be 2 ∗ δEOD
. These functions are symmetrized with respect to exchange of
deuterons.

These functions were used in density matrix Monte Carlo calculations.

In its β = 0
limit, density matrix Monte Carlo mixes the lowest energy functions much like conﬁguration
interaction in electronic structure calculations. Tables II and III show the energies obtained
in these variational calculations for OSS and SSH potentials, respectively. The guiding
function used was Ψtrial(q) =

of 1
2 so that higher states than M are eﬃciently sampled. Alternatively, M could be made
larger. However, the cost of making M larger is higher than the cost of making ρ = 1
4.
Independent estimates for the zero-point energy of 0.02516(3) Hartree (5522(7) /cm) and
0.03042(3) Hartree (6676(7) /cm) are found using diﬀusion Monte Carlo for the OSS and SSH
potentials, respectively. Inclusion of a small number of excited states substantially improves
the predicted zero-point energy; the 20-30% error with the pair product wavefunction is
reduced to about a 10% error with inclusion of nine states. However, the improvement of
this prediction with increasing numbers of excited states is slow. As shown in Tables II
and III, inclusion of 94 and 99 states still results in a 4-6% error.

(cid:17)

The variational energies are signiﬁcantly improved by density matrix Monte Carlo as
β increases from zero with 9 excited state functions. Including more functions accelerates
the convergence. (see Figure 4) Tables IV and V show the energy estimates for lowest 5
symmetric states for OSS and SSH respectively. The average energies and their standard

7

deviations as a function of β were used in a Marquardt’s ﬁt to the function A + Be−β/C.
Error bars were obtained by dividing the conﬁgurations used to calculate the matrices into
smaller sets, diagonalizing these sets, obtaining the standard deviation for their eigenvalues,
and dividing it by the square root of the number of sets. Assuming that the distribution
of errors is Gaussian, the ellipsoid representing 90% error can be plotted. [51] The errors
reported in Tables IV and V are χ2 90% conﬁdence intervals. Some data was not well
approximated by a decaying exponential. In this case, the point in the plateau with the
smallest standard deviation is given. For this data which is designated by a *, 2 standard
deviations are given in parenthesis.

Because it is relevant to assessment of potential energy surface models, we note in passing
that for the OSS potential the excited vibrational state with a node rOD1·(rOD2×rOD3=0
has an energy of 0.02522(4) Hartree as determined by a ﬁxed node diﬀusion Monte Carlo
calculation. This is about about 15(24) /cm higher than the zero point energy. A model ﬁt to
experiment by Sears et al. yielded a gap of 15/cm. However, the OSS potential overestimates
the inversion barrier and, therefore, we expect it to underestimate this splitting. Beyond
this comparison, our results for both the OSS and SSH potential diﬀer signicantly from the
results of Sears et al. For example, ﬁrst totally symmetric excited states are 794(10)/cm
and 731(11)/cm above the ground state for OSS and SSH respectively. The ﬁrst totally
symmetric excited state in Sears’ ﬁt was 453/cm above the ground state. [52]

EXPRESSING CORRELATIONS BEYOND PAIRS MORE COMPACTLY

The variational principle Eq. 12 and the optimization deﬁcit can be used to search for
structural variables that are correlated with the local energy. Such variables are principal
candidates for construction of explicitly correlated wavefunctions.

Consideration of several natural possibilities for such structural variables identiﬁed the
coordinate u=rOD1·(rOD2×rOD3) as more correlated with the local energy of the pair product
wavefunction than any other combination considered. Therefore, we added a product of the
form ef (u) to our pair product wavefunction. The distribution of u and the f(u) optimization
deﬁcit (see Fig. 5) with this pair product wavefunction suggested that f(u) take the form

Ψn−body = e−a(u−b)2

+ e−a(u+b)2

.

(16)

The pair product wavefunction with moving and scaling parameters times this new mul-
tiplicative many-body factor was optimized using Variational Monte Carlo. Zero point
energies of 0.02838(4) Hartree (6229(9) /cm) and 0.03326(2) Hartree (7300(4) /cm) are ob-
tained for the correlated wavefunctions with the OSS and SSH potentials, respectively. This
is nearly as good as the VMC result with mixing of 9 states. The optimized parameters are
shown in Table VI. The new distribution and optimization deﬁcit for the OSS potential are
shown in Fig. 6.

Using pair product wavefunctions with this correlation piece as the basis in a McMillan
VMC calculation with 9 functions reduced the ground state energy to 5860(2) /cm and
7041(3) /cm for OSS and SSH potentials, respectively. These energies contain 5-6% error
with respect to the DMC ground state energies.

CONCLUSION

A pair product wavefunction for D3O+ has been obtained from an approximate density
matrix. This pair product wavefunction captures two body interactions fairly well. Varia-
tional Monte Carlo includes correlation by mixing in excited states. However, it takes about
99 states to get to an error of 4-6%. Density Matrix Monte Carlo gets accurate energies
with 9 wavefunctions. However, it does not provide a simple wavefunction.

A compact ground state function is obtained by using the variational principle to iden-
tify the most signiﬁcant many-body terms and including it directly into the wavefunc-
tion. For the D3O+ ion the most signiﬁcant such variable was the vector triple product
rOD1·(rOD2×rOD3). Variational Monte Carlo with 9 of these correlated functions yields a
ground state wavefunction with an error of 5-6% in the zero point energy.

FIG. 1. The φ(rDD) obtained by ﬁxing one of the deuterons (line with open circles) is sig-
niﬁcantly narrower than that obtained from unconstrained sampling (line with diamonds). The
co-linear assumption of ﬁxing the orientation of the reference bond (line with solid circles) is not
signiﬁcant. The points were ﬁt to cubic splines. Displacements are in ˚A .

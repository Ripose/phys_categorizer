Abstract

We study the classical electron scattering from a driven inverted Gaussian potential, an open

system, in terms of its chaotic invariant set. This chaotic invariant set is described by a ternary

horseshoe construction on an appropriate Poincare surface of section. We ﬁnd the development

parameters that describe the hyperbolic component of the chaotic invariant set. In addition, we

show that the hierarchical structure of the fractal set of singularities of the scattering functions is

the same as the structure of the chaotic invariant set. Finally, we construct a symbolic encoding

of the hierarchical structure of the set of singularities of the scattering functions and use concepts

from the thermodynamical formalism to obtain one of the measures of chaos of the fractal set of

singularities, the topological entropy.

INTRODUCTION

Simple one-dimensional atomic potentials in external time-periodic electric ﬁelds have

been used to predict several phenomena in the theory of laser-atom interactions at high

laser intensity such as stabilization with increasing laser intensity. These models are of

particular interest because their classical versions display chaotic motion [1], thus providing

insight into quantum-classical correspondence.

The one-dimensional inverted Gaussian potential in the presence of a strong time-periodic

electric ﬁeld has already oﬀered interesting insights into diﬀerent aspects of the laser-atom

interactions [2, 3, 4]. This short-range driven atomic potential has also been used to study the

phase-space picture of resonance creation and to show that the resonance states are scarred

on unstable periodic orbits of the classical motion [5]. In addition, two of the authors have

studied electron scattering from the driven inverted Gaussian and, using Floquet theory, they

constructed the Floquet scattering matrix. They found that the eigenphases of the Floquet

scattering matrix undergo a number of ”avoiding crossings” as a function of the electron

Floquet energy [6] which is a quantum manifestation of the destruction of the constants of

motion and the onset of chaos in classical phase space. These ”avoided crossings” were the

motivating factor for a detailed study of the classical chaotic electron scattering from the

driven inverted Gaussian potential which is the focus of the current work.

Of primary importance in chaotic scattering [7] is the identiﬁcation of universal features

which distinguish it from regular scattering. For open systems, one such feature is the

fractal set of singularities observed in scattering functions such as the time-delay function

[8]. This fractal set of singularities is the result of the intersection of the incoming electron

asymptotes with the invariant manifolds of the chaotic invariant set in the asymptotic region.

The chaotic invariant set underlies the structure of the classical phase space in the sense

that its properties determine the quantities which characterise the scattering process. One

such property is the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set which is the same as

2

the structure of the fractal set of singularities of the time delay function.

In section IIIA of this paper, we obtain the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant

set for the driven inverted Gaussian, which is an open system. The chaotic invariant set is

represented as a horseshoe construction in an appropriate Poincare surface of section. We

also obtain the development parameter of the horseshoe construction which describes the

hyperbolic component of the invariant set while it ignores non-hyperbolic eﬀects. In section

IIIB we compute the time delay function and show that it has a fractal set of singularities

with the same structure as the hierarchical structure of the invariant set. In section IIIC

we obtain a symbolic dynamics [9, 10], that is, a symbolic encoding of the branching tree,

that describes the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set and thus the hierarchical

structure of the fractal set of singularities of the time delay function. Finally, using concepts

from the thermodynamical formalism [11, 12, 13], we obtain one of the measures of chaos of

the fractal set of singularities of the scattering functions, the topological entropy.

II. MODEL

We study the classical scattering of an electron from a one-dimensional inverted Gaus-

sian atomic potential in the presence of a strong time-periodic electric ﬁeld. The electric

ﬁeld E(t) = E0sin(ωt) (T = 2π/ω is the period of the ﬁeld) is treated within the dipole

approximation as a monochromatic inﬁnite plane wave linearly polarized along the direction

of the incident electron. In what follows, we work in the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) [14, 15]

frame of reference, which oscillates with a free electron in the time-periodic ﬁeld. In the

KH frame there are well deﬁned asymptotic regions where the electron is under free motion.

The Hamiltonian in one space dimension x that describes the dynamics of the system in the

KH frame is in atomic units (a.u.) [6]

H(x, t) =

− V0e−((x+α(t))/δ)2

,

p2
2

where α(t) = α0sin(ωt) is the classical displacement of a free electron from its center of
oscillation in the time-periodic electric ﬁeld E(t) with α0 = −qE0/ω2 (q is the particle charge

which for the electron is q = −1 a.u.). Next, we transform Eq.(1) to a two-dimensional time-

independent system, where the total energy E of the system is conserved, as follows:

(1)

(2)

H =

− V0e−((x+α0 sin(φ))/δ)2

+ ωI.

p2

I and φ are respectively the action-angle variables of the driving ﬁeld and φ = ωt. In the

limit x → ±∞ the Gaussian atomic potential tends to zero faster than 1/x [6]. Thus, there

are well deﬁned asymptotic regions where the electron is under free motion and its dynamics

is described by the asymptotic Hamiltonian:

Has =

+ ωI.

p2
2

(3)

In the asymptotic regime, Eq.(3), the electron momentum, p, as well as the action of the

ﬁeld, I, are conserved quantities. In the following sections, all our calculations are performed

with the values V0 = 0.27035 a.u. and δ = 2 a.u. assigned to the parameters of the inverted

Gaussian potential. These values of the parameters V0 and δ were shown to describe well the
quantum behaviour of a one-dimensional model negative chlorine ion Cl− in the presence of

a laser ﬁeld [3, 4, 6, 16]. The frequency of the time periodic ﬁeld, ω, and the amplitude of the

ﬁeld, α0, are taken constant and equal to 0.65 a.u. and 0.9 a.u., respectively. These values

for the frequency and amplitude of the ﬁeld were chosen so that the resulting horseshoe

construction is not prohibitively complicated to study.

III. CHAOTIC SCATTERING

We are interested in understanding the underlying structure of the classical chaotic scat-

tering system under consideration. That implies knowledge of the chaotic invariant set. In

what follows, we ﬁrst show how to construct the hierarchical structure of the chaotic in-

variant set for the inverted Gaussian atomic potential driven by a laser ﬁeld. The scheme

we follow to construct the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set is valid only

for systems with two degrees of freedom. Then, we show how the structure of the chaotic

invariant set allows us to understand the structure of the fractal set of singularities of the

scattering functions. We then obtain a symbolic dynamics for the hierarchical structure of

the chaotic invariant set. This symbolic dynamics describes the hierarchical structure of the

scattering functions as well. We express this symbolic dynamics in the form of a transfer

matrix [13] and compute the topological entropy which in our case is a measure of the fractal

structure of singularities of the scattering functions.

A. Chaotic invariant set

The chaotic invariant set is usually represented by a horseshoe construction in an ap-

propriate Poincare surface of section. In the case of the well-known Smale horseshoe the

construction is done by stretching a fundamental region R and folding it on to the original

region [17, 18]. The boundaries of R are given by segments of the invariant manifolds of

the outer ﬁxed points of the system. Following the above general scheme we ﬁrst deﬁne the

fundamental region R. The system under consideration has three period-one periodic orbits

(ﬁxed points). The inner ﬁxed point is an elliptic one. The two outer ﬁxed points are located

at x → ±∞. As x → ∞ the invariant stable and unstable manifolds of the outer ﬁxed point

C, see Fig.(1), converge to the same manifold (eigenvector), with p = 0. The same is true

for the manifolds of the ﬁxed point A at x → −∞. So, globally, the outer ﬁxed points

behave as unstable ones, that is, they produce invariant manifolds of the same topology as

the one produced by hyperbolic ﬁxed points. However, in a small neighbourhood around

them they behave as parabolic ones. That is, the tangent map at x → ±∞ has a degenerate

eigenvalue equal to one (one eigenvector) [1]. The invariant manifolds of these outer ﬁxed

points determine the boundaries of the fundamental area R, see Fig.(1).

In Fig.(1) the horseshoe is constructed on the Poincare surface of section φ = π/2. We use

the Poincare surface of section φ = π/2 for all our calculations. This choice of the Poincare

surface of section simpliﬁes the horseshoe construction because on this plane the time reversal

transformation t → −t is equivalent to the p → −p transformation. Thus, from the stable

manifolds of the outer ﬁxed points one obtains the unstable manifolds by letting p → −p

and vice versa. The driven inverted Gaussian has no right/left symmetry. That is, the

Hamiltonian is not invariant under the transformation x → −x. Thus, the invariant set of

the system is described by a ternary (three ﬁxed points) asymmetric horseshoe construction.

That is, the underlying structure of the scattering functions for electrons incident from the

right/left is described by two diﬀerent views right/left of the same horseshoe construction.

The reason we consider the invariant manifolds of the outer ﬁxed points is that these are

the manifolds that are ”seen” by the scattering trajectories and thus have an eﬀect on the

scattering functions.

Let us now obtain the right view of the hierarchical structure of the horseshoe construction

that underlies scattering for electrons incident from the right. The fundamental area R, see

5

Fig.(1), is deﬁned by the zero order tendrils as well as an inﬁnite number of preimages/images

of the unstable/stable invariant manifolds, respectively. We now add one iteration step of

the stable manifolds. That is, using Hamilton’s equations of motion for the Hamiltonian

given in Eq.(2) we propagate the points on the segments of the stable manifolds, AD and

EC in Fig.(1), backwards in time for one period of the driving ﬁeld (To obtain the tendrils

of the unstable manifolds we propagate forward in time). The intersection of the ﬁrst image,

ﬁrst order tendrils, of the stable manifolds with the unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point C,

segment CD in Fig.(1), reveals the ﬁrst order gap Gs

1, see Fig.(2). The intersection with

the unstable manifold of one more iteration step of the stable manifolds reveals the second

order gaps Gs

2, see Fig.(2). Thus, the gap Gs

the stable manifold and the boundary of the fundamental area R. A point that lies in Gs

n is the area enclosed by the nth order tendril of
n is

mapped out of the fundamental region after n applications of the map, it is thus of hierarchy

level n. These gaps play an important role because they are areas which are not needed to

cover the invariant set. No higher level tendrils of the invariant manifolds will ever enter such

gaps. So, with each iteration step one further tendril of the stable manifolds is added and one

further level of hierarchy of these gaps is displayed [19]. We therefore see the construction

scheme of the horseshoe by going from one level of hierarchy to the next. We note that

the term gaps corresponds to what is known as lobes in ﬂuid transport problems [20]. In

particular, the gaps correspond to those lobes that are inside the area R. In a similar way,

we construct the left view of the hierarchical structure of the horseshoe construction that

underlies scattering for electrons incident from the left, see Fig.(2). The intersection points

of the stable manifolds with the unstable manifolds of the outer ﬁxed points, seen in Fig.(2)

are the so called homoclinic/heteroclinic points for intersecting manifolds corresponding to

the same (homoclinic) or diﬀerent (heteroclinic) ﬁxed points. These homoclinic/heteroclinic

intersections underly the classical chaotic scattering.

Next, we compute the so called development parameter that approximately gives the

development stage of the horseshoe construction. The signiﬁcance of this parameter is that

it describes universal aspects of the horseshoe and ignores the details. That is, it determines

the hyperbolic component of the invariant set which is the important part for the scattering

behaviour and neglects non-hyperbolic eﬀects that are due to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser

(KAM) tori [19, 21, 22]. The non-hyperbolic eﬀects appear at high levels of the hierarchy as

tangencies, non transversal intersections, between stable and unstable manifolds and have a

6

very small eﬀect on the scattering functions (see [10] for more details on tangencies between

stable and unstable manifolds). For the values of the frequency and the amplitude of the

driving ﬁeld we choose, there are tangencies when 4th, n = 4, order tendrils of the stable

manifolds are intersecting 4th order tendrils of the unstable manifolds in the interior of the

fundamental region. The eﬀect of these tangencies in the interior of the fundamental region

becomes visible in the scattering functions at a hierarchical level 2n, in our case 8. The

reason is that if an nth order tendril of the stable manifold intersects tangentially an nth

order tendril of the unstable manifold in the interior of the fundamental region, then the

n + 1 tendril of the stable manifold will intersect the n − 1 tendril of the unstable manifold,

and so on, until the n + n tendril of the stable manifold intersects the zero order tendril of

the unstable manifold, that is, when the 2n tendril of the stable manifold intersects the local

segment (zero order tendril) of the unstable manifold. But, as we show in the next section,

it is exactly the structure of the intersections of the stable manifolds with the local segment

of the unstable manifold that is ”picked” by the scattering functions.

The development parameter has the value 1 for a complete horseshoe. A horseshoe is

complete when the tendril of level 1 of the unstable manifold reaches the other side of the

fundamental area R. For an incomplete horseshoe the development parameter is determined

by the relative length of the tendril of level 1 of the unstable manifold as compared to the
complete case. It is given by rnN −n [19], where n is the highest level of hierarchy considered,

rn is the number of the gap that the tendril of order 1 of the unstable manifold reaches up

to, counting the gaps starting from the ﬁxed point and N is the number of the ﬁxed points.

For the system under consideration N = 3. It is important to realize that the numbers are

assigned to the gaps of the incomplete horseshoe construction after comparing with the gaps

of the complete horseshoe construction [19]. Note, that the value of the formal parameter,
given by rnN −n, remains the same when diﬀerent hierarchy levels are considered. The

reason is, that as we go from a hierarchy level n to the next hierarchy level n + 1, N − 1

gaps are added between successive gaps at the hierarchy level n, in the complete horseshoe

construction. Thus, one can show that if the number rn is assigned to a certain gap at

hierarchy level n, the number rn+1 assigned to the same gap at hierarchy level n + 1 is
rn+1 = Nrn. So, rn+1N −(n+1) = rnN −n and the value of the formal parameter remains the

same.

As already mentioned, for ω = 0.65 a.u. and α0 = 0.9 a.u. the driven inverted Gaussian

7

is described by a ternary asymmetric horseshoe construction and it is thus described by two

development parameters. The development parameter that corresponds to the manifolds

of the ﬁxed point at x → −∞, A, has the value 1 since the ﬁrst order tendril of the

unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point A reaches the other side of the fundamental area R, see

Fig.(2). The development parameter that corresponds to the manifolds of the ﬁxed point

at x → +∞, C, has the value 1/3 as can be seen in Fig.(2). The value 1/3 is obtained

if we consider tendrils up to hierarchy level n = 1 then the ﬁrst order tendril

as follows:
of the unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point C, tu,C
consider tendrils up to hierarchy level n = 2 then tu,C
for hierarchy level n = 3 tu,C

1

1

1

, reaches up to the r = 1 gap.

If we

reaches up to the r = 3 gap and

reaches up to the r = 9 gap. That is, the value of the

development parameter remains the same when diﬀerent hierarchy levels are considered.

In Fig.(3), we see how the KAM tori around the middle ﬁxed point cause an incomplete

horseshoe construction. So for ω = 0.65 a.u. and α0 = 0.9 a.u. the chaotic invariant set is

described by a ternary asymmetric horseshoe construction with development parameters 1

and 1/3. For reasons explained at the end of section II, the frequency is taken equal to 0.65

a.u. (high frequency regime compared to V0 = 0.27035 a.u.). For this frequency a horseshoe

with development parameters 1 and 1/3 is realized approximately in the interval (0.7, 1.15)

a.u. of the amplitude of the ﬁeld, α0.

B. Scattering functions

The scattering functions give properties of the ﬁnal electron asymptotes as a function of

the incoming electron asymptotes. In the case of classical chaotic scattering the scattering

functions have a fractal set of singularities. This fractal set of singularities is the result of

the intersection of the incoming electron asymptotes with the underlying chaotic invariant

set. That is, when the scattering electron trajectory starts exactly on the stable manifold of

the chaotic invariant set it stays on the chaotic set forever, resulting in a singularity of the

scattering function. Furthermore, the structure of the set of singularities is the same as the

structure of the chaotic invariant set [19].

In what follows, we compute the time delay, T del, one of the most important scattering

functions. The time delay is a measure of how much the incoming electron delays due to its

8

interaction with the potential in the scattering region and is given by:

T del = T − |

| − |

xin
pin

xout
pout

|.

(4)

T is the time it takes for the electron to travel from the incoming to the outgoing asymptotic

region. There is an arbitrariness in the time T due to the speciﬁc choice of the initial distance

xin that the timing is initiated in the incoming asymptotic region and the ﬁnal distance xout

that the timing is stopped in the outgoing asymptotic region. To remove this arbitrariness

we substract the time that the electron spends running along the initial and ﬁnal asymptotes,
| xin
pin | and | xout

pout | respectively.

We consider scattering from the right and compute the time delay function for a line of

initial conditions in the asymptotic regime that completely intersects one tendril of the stable

manifold of the outer ﬁxed point A, see Fig.(4). We compute the time delay function, for the

choice of initial conditions denoted as 0 in Fig.(4), as a function of the initial momentum,

pin, along the line of initial conditions, see Fig.(5). This choice of initial conditions allows

us to understand the structure of singularities of the time delay function as follows. From

Fig.(4) we see that the iterates in time of the line of initial conditions converge toward the

boundary of the fundamental region that is deﬁned by the local segment of the unstable

manifold of the ﬁxed point C. The intersections of the line of initial conditions with the

stable manifold of the ﬁxed point A are mapped on intersections of the iterates with the

same stable manifold. Thus, the singularity structure of the scattering function is the same

as the pattern resulting from the intersection of the stable manifolds with the local segment

of the unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point C. That implies that the intervals of continuity of

the scattering function correspond to the gaps that the tendrils of the stable manifolds cut

into the fundamental area of the horseshoe construction. In other words, the pattern of the

fractal set of singularities of the time delay function is the same as the hierarchical structure

of the horseshoe construction. We further illustrate this point as follows.

In Fig.(6a),

we compute the hierarchy level of the intervals of continuity for part of the time delay

function, see Fig.(6b) (Fig.(6b) is a magniﬁcation of part of Fig.(5)). To do so, we initiate

trajectories at the intervals of continuity of the delay function and count the number of times

the scattering trajectories ”step” into the fundamental region, see Fig.(6a). If a scattering

trajectory ”steps” inside the area R n − 1 times that means that it takes n applications of

the map before it is mapped outside of R. We thus say that the trajectory was initiated at

9

an interval of continuity of hierarchy level n. For example, we see from Fig.(6a) that the

scattering trajectory with pin = −0.1973 ”steps” two times inside R. Thus, the interval of

continuity it was initiated at is of hierarchy level three. The resulting pattern of singularities

shown in Fig.(6a) is the same as the pattern of singularities of the time delay function as a

comparison of Figs.(6a) and (6b) reveals.

Let us now explain how the hierarchy level of the intervals of continuity is related to the

gaps of the horseshoe construction. As we illustrate in Fig.(7), if a scattering trajectory

approaches the local segment of the unstable manifold along a gap of order n, then it steps

inside the area R n − 1 times before it is mapped outside R. At the same time, if the

scattering trajectory steps inside the area R n − 1 times that means that it is mapped

outside of R after n applications of the map and thus the trajectory was initiated at an

interval of continuity of hierarchy level n. Thus, a gap of hierarchy level n of the horseshoe

construction corresponds to an interval of continuity of hierarchy level n of the time delay

function. That implies that the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set and of

the scattering functions is the same. Indeed, a comparison of Figs.(6a) and (9) (Fig.(9) is

explained in the following section) reveals that the pattern of singularities of the time delay

function in Fig.(6b) is the same as that part of the hierarchical structure of the chaotic

invariant set that is encircled by a square in Fig.(9).

For the system under consideration the potential in the interaction region is known and

so we can directly obtain the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set and thus the

structure of the scattering functions. However, when the potential in the interaction region

is not known, then one has to ﬁnd from asymptotic observations the hierarchical structure

of the scattering functions in order to obtain the structure of the chaotic invariant set.

C. Measures of Chaos

It is possible to construct a topological measure of the degree of chaos contained in this

scattering system if we can construct a symbolic dynamics which reproduces the hierarchy of

intersections of the stable and unstable manifolds. The ﬁrst step is to obtain the branching

trees that describe the right/left view of the horseshoe constructions for scattering from the

right/left respectively. The second step involves the development of a symbolic dynamics

which reproduces the structure of the branching trees.

It is important to note that for

10

the values of the amplitude and the frequency of the driving ﬁeld considered there are

tangencies between the stable and unstable manifolds on the 4th order tendrils. These

tangencies introduce non-hyperbolic eﬀects that will cause a breakdown of the symbolic

dynamics starting from hierarchy level 8 and higher. However, knowledge of the symbolic

dynamics up to hierarchy level 8 gives a signiﬁcant measure of the degree of observable chaos

in this scattering system.

1. Branching Trees

Let us ﬁrst obtain a branching tree [19], that describes the right view of the horseshoe

construction for scattering from the right. We will use information developed in Section IIIA.

First, let us consider the interval I 0

1 which corresponds to the local segment of the unstable

manifold CD of the ﬁxed point C (see Fig.(8)). This is the ﬁrst step in the construction of

the branching tree and corresponds to hierarchy level n = 0. In the second step, hierarchy

level n=1, the ﬁrst order tendril of the stable manifold of the ﬁxed point A cuts the interval

(s0, s1) out of I 0

1 and leaves two intervals I 1

1 (the segment of CD from D to s0) and I 1

2 (the

segment of CD from s1 to C). In the third step, hierarchy level n = 2, the second order
tendril of the stable manifold of the ﬁxed point A cuts the interval (s4, s5) out of I 1
leaves two intervals, I 2

21 (the segment of CD from s1 to s4) and I 2
22 (the segment of CD
from s5 to C). In the same step (the same iteration) the second order tendril of the stable
manifold of the ﬁxed point C cuts the interval (s2, s3) out of I 1
1 and leaves two intervals, I 2
11
(the segment of CD from D to s2) and I 2
12 (the segment of CD from s3 to s0). Continuing

2 and

this process we obtain the branching tree shown in Fig.(9).

In a similar way, we construct the branching tree that describes the left view of the

horseshoe construction for scattering from the left, see Fig.(10). The hierarchical structure

of these branching trees is the same as the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set.

2. Symbolic Dynamics

Having determined the geometry of the branching trees, we can now construct a symbolic

dynamics that encodes the branching trees. In principle, since we have a non-hyperbolic

horseshoe construction one needs an inﬁnite number of grammatical rules to construct a

11

symbolic dynamics. However, we can construct an approximate symbolic dynamics that

describes well the outermost hyperbolic component of the horseshoe construction. The

symbolic encoding of the branching tree is not unique, but the measures of chaos one obtains

for diﬀerent encodings are the same.

Our symbolic dynamics consists of four symbol values A,B,C and + and a set of gram-

matical rules that allow us to encode each branch of the branching tree. That is, each branch

of the tree of hierarchy level n, is labeled by a vertical sequence (string) of n symbols made

out of the four symbol values A,B,C, and +. Each symbol sequence is read vertically up

the branch of the tree (see Figs.(9) and (10)). The order in which the four symbol values

appear in each branch of the tree is determined by the grammatical rules. That is, the rules

tell us which of the four symbol values are allowed to be appended to a given branch of the

tree as we go from a certain hierarchy level to the next.

Our rules depend on the last ”word” that appears on a given branch. This ”word” is a

vertical sequence of one two or three symbols and can be either of the eleven ”words”: A,

++, B+C, C+C, ++C, CC, BC, AC, B, B+ and C+ (see Figs.(9) and (10)). The rules are:

• After a string (branch) ending in A, B + C, C + C or ++ it is allowed to attach

the symbols A, B and C, going from left to right (standard orientation). Thus, three

strings (branches) stem out ending in A, B and C.

• After a string (branch) ending in AC, B, BC, B+, C+, CC or + + C it is allowed

to attach the symbols + and C, going from left to right (standard orientation). Thus,

two strings (branches) stem out ending in +, C.

• B always inverts the previous orientation.

• C always inverts the previous orientation if it comes after S+, where S is not +.

• + always inverts the previous orientation if it comes after S where S is not +.

By previous orientation we mean the following: if at a hierarchy level n there are three

branches ending, for example, in the symbols A, B and C, going from left to right (see

Fig.(10)), then at hierarchy level n + 1, from the string ending in B two strings stem out

with symbol endings + and C, according to the second grammatical rule. According to

the third grammatical rule, the symbol endings + and C, going from left to right, at level

12

n + 1, must have the inverse orientation to the one of the symbol endings at level n. In

this example, at level n, the symbol endings A, B and C, going from left to right, have the

standard orientation. Thus, after the string ending in B, two branches stem out, at level

n + 1, with symbol endings C and +, going from left to right, see Fig.(10).

To symbolically encode the right/left branching trees in Figs.(9) and (10) we have started

at level n = 1 by attaching the symbols + and C for the right and A, B and C for the left

view of the branching trees, respectively, and then use the above grammatical rules to

continue the encoding. Using these rules we can encode and thus obtain the structure of the

branching trees safely up to hierarchy level 7. For the values of the frequency and amplitude

of the driving ﬁeld we consider here, there are tangencies between the invariant manifolds at

level four in the interior of the fundamental region. These tangencies can cause our symbolic

encoding to break down at hierarchy level 8 and higher of the branching tree. That is, these

tangencies can introduce additional branches in the branching tree, starting at level 8, which

are not accounted for by our grammatical rules. Note, that the above described symbolic

dynamics encodes the branching trees of the scattering functions as well.

If we now use concepts from a thermodynamical formalism [11, 12], we can express the

above described grammatical rules in the form of a transfer matrix [13]. To construct the

transfer matrix we use as entries the eleven ”words” listed earlier. The matrix element (l, m)

is 1 if it is possible to attach to the ”word” l a symbol such that the resulting string ending

is the ”word” m, otherwise the matrix element is 0. In other words, if the transfer matrix

element (l, m) is one it means that if at a certain hierarchy level we have a string ending

in the ”word” l when we go to the next hierarchy level it is allowed to encounter a string

ending in the ”word” m. To clarify this point, consider for example the string ending with

the ”word” l = ++ (see Fig.(11)). According to the ﬁrst grammatical rule, after the ”word”

++ we can attach three symbols labeled A, B and C and so obtain the strings + + A,

+ + B and + + C. These strings have the string endings, m = A, m = B and m = + + C,

respectively, which can be identiﬁed with three of the eleven ”words”. Thus, the matrix

elements (++, A), (++, B) and (++, + + C) are one, while all other matrix elements with

l = ++ are 0.

Having constructed the transfer matrix, we can now compute the topological entropy

of the branching tree. The topological entropy is a measure of the degree of chaos in the

scattering system. Let us ﬁrst describe the relation between the topological entropy and the

13

transfer matrix. The topological entropy K0 is the rate of exponential growth of the number

of intervals Z(n), or equivalently the number of branches Z(n), at a hierarchical level n when

n is large with Z(n) = enK0 [11]. It directly follows that K0 = ln(Z(n + 1)/Z(n)). But, for

large n, Z(n + 1)/Z(n) is the average branching ratio of the trees. This ratio is given by

the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix [13]. For our system, the largest eigenvalue is

≈ 2.31. Thus, the topological entropy of the branching tree is K0 ≈ 0.84. This topological

entropy describes the rate of growth of the branches in the hierarchical structure of the

scattering functions and is thus a measure of chaos of the fractal set of singularities.

It is useful to mention that for a horseshoe with N ﬁxed points the value of the topological

entropy, K0, can vary between 0 and ln(N). This is easily understood, since for a horseshoe

with N ﬁxed points the maximum value of the average branching ratio is N and K0 is the

logarithm of the average branching ratio. Thus, for a ternary horseshoe construction, the

case currently under consideration, K0 can vary between 0 and ln(3) ≈ 1.1. For the values

of the frequency and amplitude of the driving ﬁeld considered in this paper, we ﬁnd that

K0 ≈ 0.84, close to the maximum value of 1.1, which suggests that our system is in the

regime of strong chaos.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have studied the classical electron scattering from a driven inverted

Gaussian potential which is an open system. We have shown that the fractal pattern of sin-

gularities of the scattering functions can be understood in terms of the hierarchical structure

of the chaotic invariant set which underlies the chaotic dynamics. We have constructed a

symbolic encoding of the hierarchical structure of the chaotic invariant set. Using concepts

from the thermodynamical formalism, we have used this encoding to obtain the topological

entropy of the fractal set of singularities of the scattering functions.

• Fig1. The fundamental region R is formed by the unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point

A, segment AE, by the stable manifold of the ﬁxed point C, segment CE, by the

unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point C, segment CD, and the stable manifold of the

ﬁxed point A, segment AD.

• Fig2. Horseshoe construction up to hierarchy level two on the Poincare surface of

section φ = π/2. The solid lines indicate tendrils of order zero, the dashed lines

indicate tendrils of order one and the dotted lines indicate tendrils of order two. The

gaps Gs

n on the bottom right/top left are formed by intersections of the stable manifolds

of the ﬁxed points A and C with the local segment of the unstable manifold of the ﬁxed

point C/A, that is, CD/ AE. These intersections describe the right view/left view

of the horseshoe construction.

manifold of the ﬁxed point C.

• Fig3. The initial conditions used to generate this strobe plot lie on the line p = 0. This

strobe plot is generated by evolving the trajectories forward in time and it thus ”picks”

the unstable manifolds of the ﬁxed points A and C. The location of the middle ﬁxed

point, B, (period-1 orbit) is located at x = 0.29 and is indicated by a ﬁlled rectangle.

Comparing with Fig.(1), we see that the ﬁrst order tendril of the unstable manifold
of the ﬁxed point A, tu,A
, penetrates the fundamental area R completely. In the case
though of the ﬁrst order tendril of the unstable manifold of the ﬁxed point C, tu,C

,

the KAM tori around the ﬁxed point B prevents it from reaching the boundary of the

fundamental area R.

• Fig4. For scattering from the right, we indicate as 0 the line of initial conditions in

the asymptotic region used to compute the time delay function. This set of initial

conditions intersects the stable manifold of the ﬁxed point A. The numbers 1 − 4

indicate successive iterations in time of the set of initial conditions.

• Fig5. Time delay function as a function of the initial momentum for the set of initial

conditions shown in Fig.(4).

16

• Fig6. In a) we show the hierarchy level of the intervals of continuity for part of the

time delay function, see Fig.(5). For a given pair of initial values, x0, p0, we propagate

the trajectories until they reach one of the asymptotic regions and count the number

of times the trajectory steps in the fundamental area R.

In b) we plot the time

delay function for the same range of initial conditions as for the hierarchy level of the

intervals of continuity shown in a). We can immediately see that both functions have

the same pattern of singularities.

• Fig7. The solid lines indicate tendrils of order zero, the dashed lines tendrils of order

one, the dotted lines tendrils of order two and the dashed-dot line tendrils of order

three. We initiate a trajectory in the right asymptotic region with pin = −0.1973

which is inside an interval of continuity, see Fig.(6a). We then successively iterate

the trajectory in time (stars). The successive iterations are indicated by numbers 1-8,

respectively. The trajectory approaches the local segment CD of the unstable manifold

of the ﬁxed point C inside the third order tendril of the stable manifold of the ﬁxed

point A along a third order gap. One more iteration in time maps area a (shaded by

dots), which is enclosed by the third order tendril of the stable manifold of the ﬁxed

point A and its unstable manifold, into area b (shaded by lines), which is enclosed by

the second order tendril of the stable manifold of point A and its unstable manifold.

A further iteration in time maps area b into area c (shaded by lines), which is enclosed

by the ﬁrst order tendril of the stable manifold of point A and its unstable manifold.

Finally, area c is mapped to area d (shaded by lines) and enclosed by the zero order

tendril of the stable manifold of point A and its unstable manifold. But area d is

outside the fundamental region and thus the trajectory steps inside the fundamental

region two times. Generally, if the scattering trajectory approaches the local segment

of the unstable manifold along a gap of hierarchical order n it will ”step” inside the

fundamental area, R, n-1 times before it is mapped outside R.

• Fig8. Construction of the branching tree for scattering from the right. The ﬁrst order

gap Gs

1 reduces the initial interval I 0

1 , at hierarchy level n = 0, down to the two

intervals I 1

1 and I 1

2 . Note that for the scattering functions, we obtain exactly the same

branching tree as for the chaotic invariant set. For the scattering functions, instead of

the gaps it is the intervals of continuity that are cut out from the original interval in

17

a Cantor set structure.

• Fig9. Branching tree and symbolic dynamics for scattering from the right shown up

to hierarchy level four. Each interval corresponds to one branch of the tree. A branch

at hierarchy level n is described by a string of length n.

• Fig10. Branching tree and symbolic dynamics for scattering from the left shown up

to hierarchy level four. Let us now explain what we mean by previous orientation in

terms for example of the third grammatical rule. For example, at the hierarchical level

n = 2, indicated by the arrow, the symbol endings of the three branches going from

left to right are A, B and C which is what we deﬁne as standard orientation. After the

symbol value B we can attach the symbols + and C at the hierarchical level n = 3,

indicated again by an arrow. According to the third grammatical rule the symbols

+ and C, at level n = 3, will be attached, after B, so that they have the inverse

orientation of the symbol values at level n = 2. So, since at level n = 2 the symbols A,

B and C are attached in standard orientation then at level n = 3 we attach after B

symbols C and + going form left to right, resulting in an inverse orientation compared

to the one at level n = 2. Thus, we say that B always inverts the previous orientation.

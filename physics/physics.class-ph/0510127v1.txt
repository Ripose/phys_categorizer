Abstract. On the basis of Galilean invariance and the Doppler formula, combined with an observational condition, it is shown
that the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo can be derived, together with time-dilatation and Lorentz contraction. It is
not necessary to take the constancy as a postulate.

INTRODUCTION

In this centenary of Einstein’s annus mirabilis, it is proper to reconsider one of his breakthroughs. We shall focus here
on his 1905 paper on special relativity [1], in the language of the train-embankment setup he discussed in later works
[2].

Motivated by the results of H. A. Lorentz on electrodynamics [3, 4], involving the invariance of the velocity of light,
Einstein postulated that the speed of light is the same in all non-accelerated systems of reference. He deduced from
this statement, combined with the principle of relativity, the kinematic base of the theory of special relativity.

In particular, Einstein drew attention to the issue of the non-absolutism of time, the effect of time dilatation: a
material event lasting a certain time for an observer at rest with respect to it, lasts a longer time for an observer moving
with constant speed with respect to it. This aspect explains why cosmic muons can be observed on the surface of the
earth, since their rather short decay time is dilated for observers on the earth, so that part of them survive the travel
through the earth’s atmosphere.

It is known that non-absolutism of time is behind the constancy of the velocity of the light. But, by itself, this is a
difﬁcult notion. In observational terms the constancy of the speed of light is also difﬁcult to understand. We do not
enter here any deep discussion about non-absolutism of time, except that we call attention to the fact that atomic clocks
also emit light and, consequently, they are not so different from lamps.

It is the purpose of the present paper to offer an alternative, pedagogic derivation of the constancy of the speed of

light. We do not make any assumption on the velocity of the light but on numbers of cycles and on frequencies.

In section II we present our setup, in section III we pose our conditions and in section IV we analyze the situation.

We end up with concluding that our conditions imply a derivation of the constancy of the speed of light.

THE SETUP OF TRAIN, EMBANKMENT, LAMPS AND OBSERVERS

A train having speed ve > 0 passes an embankment. A point in the train is called the origin Otrain and at time t = 0
this passes the origin of the embankment called Oemb. In the setup there are lamps. The ﬁrst is at the origin of the
embankment Oemb, the second at the origin of the train Otrain. There are also two observers. One uses the point
Otrain as reference and is called observer-train. Another one takes the embankment as reference and is called observer-
embankment. We also consider another point on the embankment at a distance Xe > 0 in the direction of the movement
of the train, at which observer-embankment can measure light.

The lamp at the embankment has, according to observer-embankment, a certain frequency f obs−e

the train has a different frequency, f obs−t
observer-train, it has the same frequency as the light he observes from the lamp at the embankment, f obs−t

lamp−e. The lamp in
lamp−t according to observer-train. This frequency is ﬁxed such that, according to
lamp−e.

lamp−t = f obs−t

Both observers have a clock.

CONDITIONS

1: Galilean invariance

The train moves with speed ve > 0 according to the observer-embankment. We assume that the observer-train

observes that the origin of the embankment Oemb moves with respect to him with speed vt = −ve.

2: Applicability of Doppler formula

The lamp of the embankment produces in time-interval (0,te) a number of cycles Nobs−e

number Mobs−e
the classical Doppler formula to the number Nobs−e

lamp−ete. The
lamp−e(te) of cycles reaching the train in this interval is assumed, by observer-embankment, to be related by
lamp−e(te) emitted at the embankment,

lamp−e(te) = f obs−e

where

with ce the speed of light according to observer-embankment.

lamp−e(te) = (1 − b e)Nobs−e

b e =

,

3: Identiﬁcation of times

Both observers count t = 0 for the event where Otrain passes Oemb. Let us denote the time of observer-embankment
as te and the time of observer-train as tt . Later we shall see that these times are indeed different. We relate their
times by equating the number of cycles observed by observer-train with the number of cycles presumed by observer-
embankment:

lamp−e(tt ) = Mobs−e
Mobs−t

lamp−e(te).

4: Conservation of information

This is a physical condition: Observer-embankment measures the same frequency from lamp-embankment and

lamp-train:

If it is not satisﬁed, the speed of light will not be constant.

lamp−t = f obs−e
f obs−e
lamp−e.

ANALYSIS OF FREQUENCIES

The frequency for observer-train

The observer-train counts the number Mobs−t

lamp−e in a period he denotes as (0,tt ). Observer-embankment knows about
this counting and calls the period (0,te). We shall see that it is necessary to assume that for observer-embankment this

where g e is for now some unknown factor. If it would appear to be equal to unity, there would be no time-dilatation.
But we shall show below that it is equal the Lorentz factor 1/p1 − b 2
e .
The frequency of the lamp at the embankment is for observer-train

te = g ett ,

f obs−t
lamp−e =

This becomes equal to

f obs−t
lamp−e = g e(1 − b e)

= g e(1 − b e) f obs−e

lamp−e.

Nobs−e
lamp−e(te)
te

From the expression for g e that we shall deduce, this will appear to be red-shifted.

In the setup outlined above, the lamp in the train emits light with exactly this frequency, according to observer-train.
In accordance with Eq. (5), the time to reach the position Xe of observer-embankment is according to observer-train

Frequency of the lamp in the train according to observer-embankment

Now we repeat this argument for the lamp in the train, which is observed by observer-embankment. This means that
there is an interchange in the role of lamps and clocks. Whereas the lamp in the embankment was going away from
this observer, there is a time interval, according to observer-train (0,tx;t ), in which the train approaches position Xe.
Observer-embankment calls this the interval (0,tx;e), with tx;e = Xe/ve.

Consider observer-train’s time interval (t′

t ,tx,t ). In this interval the number of cycles produced by the lamp in the

where the primes indicates that now lamp-train is discussed. According to the Doppler formula, observer-train assumes
that the number of cycles received by observer-embankment in the related time-interval is

lamp, located in the train, is approaching Xe.

Because in our setup is designed such that f obs−t

lamp−t = f obs−t

lamp−e, it follows from Eq. (7) that

According to our condition 4, these frequencies are the same, so we conclude that

lamp−t = g t (1 − b t)g e(1 − b e) f obs−e
f obs−e
lamp−e.

g t (1 − b t)g e(1 − b e) = 1.

A mirror of the setup

In our setup, the origin of the train Otrain had just passed the origin of the embankment Oemb and moved on. In
an alternative setup, we might have considered the approach of the train, while observer-embankment performs a
measurement at the point −Xe < 0. For observer-train, approaching the lamp of the embankment, its frequency would
be blue-shifted rather than red-shifted, and the lamp in the train is supposed to be adjusted to this new value.

Repeating all steps one-by-one in the two related time-intervals, we would deduce that now Eq. (15) holds with the
signs of b e and b t altered, because of the interchange of approaching and separating. Keeping our previous deﬁnitions
of b e and b t , this means that

g e(1 + b e)g t (1 + b t) = 1.

Derivation of the constancy of the speed of light

When dividing Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) we obtain

This has the solution

(1 − b t)(1 − b e)
(1 + b e)(1 + b t)

= 1.

b e = −b t

or

ve
ce

= − vt
ct

.

Since by our Galilean condition we have assumed that vt = −ve, we deduce that the speed of light is the same in

both systems of reference, even though they move with respect to each other,

Now going back to (15), we are left with

ce = ct .

1 − b 2

This reveals that the classical choice g e = g t = 1 is excluded, as is the choice g t = 1/g e, that one might naively have
guessed when comparing (5) and (12). Instead, the solution is to assume that both observers are completely equivalent,
so that g e = g t , which yields

g eg t =

p1 − b 2

This is indeed the Lorentz factor. So given our Condition 4, we did have to assume time-dilatation in order to solve the
problem.

g e =

The distance between the origin Oemb and the position Xe of observer-embankment is for observer-train

where we used (8). So also the Lorentz contraction is derived in this analysis.

DISCUSSION

We have demanded a few observational conditions. The most important one is the condition on conservation of
information: the frequency directly observed from a lamp is the same as when this light is absorbed and re-emitted in
a moving reference frame. From this we were able to derive the constancy of the speed of light in vacuo, and, with it,
the time dilatation and the Lorentz contraction. This provides conditions under which the theory of special relativity
is valid.

It is interesting to see that in this approach the observers are to a large extent classical: they adopt the Galilean
principle and the Doppler formula applied to the number of cycles of the light. It is only when their times are
compared, that a time-dilatation has to be taken into account. Indeed, without it our conditions have been shown
to lead to contradictions.

The time-dilatation needs not be known to the observers themselves, they need not communicate with each other
about their ﬁndings. It is only known to “us”, as external observers, trying to unify the observations of these two
individuals.

The physical presence of observers can as usual be replaced by e.g. automated photo camera’s, as is often done in
practice. But somewhere down the line someone is needed to read and reconcile these observations. This reconciliation
is accomplished with Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which holds provided the conditions for our analysis are
valid.

ABSTRACT: The reﬂection of a normally incident wideband pulse by a half–

space whose permittivity and permeability obey the one–resonance Lorentz model

is calculated. The results are compared with those from frequency–domain reﬂection

analysis. In the spectral regime wherein the real parts of the permittivity and the

permeability are negative, as well as in small adjacent neighborhoods of that regime,

the time–domain analysis validates the conclusion that it is suﬃcient to ensure that

the imaginary part of the refractive index is positive — regardless of the sign of the

real part of the refractive index.

Key words: negative real permeability; negative real permittivity; time–domain

analysis

1 Introduction

Take a half–space occupied by an isotropic, homogeneous, dielectric medium of
relative permittivity ǫr(λ0) = ǫ′

r (λ0), where λ0 is the free–space wavelength.

r(λ0)+iǫ′′

When a plane wave with electric ﬁeld phasor of unit amplitude is incident normally

on this half–space, the amplitude r(λ0) of the electric ﬁeld phasor of the reﬂected

plane wave is given by

r(λ0) = n(λ0)−1

n(λ0)+1

n(λ0) =

ǫr(λ0)

p
where n(λ0) is the refractive index. The foregoing standard result is found in count-

less many textbooks; see, e.g., Born & Wolf [1] and Jackson [2]. It can be applied

to insulators, poor conductors as well as good conductors.

Let the medium occupying the half–space also have magnetic properties repre-

sented by the relative permeability µr(λ0) = µ′

r(λ0) + iµ′′

r (λ0). Then, the previous

result has to be modiﬁed as follows:

(2)

r(λ0) = [n(λ0)/µr (λ0)]−1

[n(λ0)/µr (λ0)]+1

n(λ0) =

ǫr(λ0) µr(λ0)

This result (2) for the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(λ0) gains particular prominence

in the context of composite materials that supposedly exhibit {ǫ′

r < 0, µ′

r < 0} and

{ǫ′′

r ≥ 0, µ′′

r ≥ 0} in some spectral regime [3] — the time–dependence exp(−iωt)

being implicit for all electromagnetic ﬁelds, with ω as the angular frequency. Shelby
et al. [3] argued that the real part of n(λ0) = n′(λ0) + in′′(λ0) must then be chosen

to be negative. Consequently, it was concluded [5] that “[p]lane waves appear to

propagate from plus and minus inﬁnity towards the source ......

[but] ...... clearly

energy propagates outwards from the source.” The conclusion has been employed

to deduce the ampliﬁcation of evanescent plane waves, leading to a proposal for

aberration–free lenses [6].

Certainly, energy does not ﬂow in the backward direction. Rather, the forward

direction is deﬁned as the direction of the energy transport, while the phase velocity

2

may then be pointed in the backward direction — a known phenomenon [7]. Assum-

ing the one–resonance Drude model for both ǫr(λ0) and µr(λ0), conﬁning themselves
to the spectral regime wherein ǫ′

r(λ0) < 0, and impedance–matching

r(λ0) < 0 and µ′

the dielectric–magnetic half–space to free space, Ziolkowski and Heyman [4] pointed

out that the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(λ0) must have ﬁnite magnitude. Employing the

one–resonance Lorentz model for both ǫr(λ0) and µr(λ0), McCall et al. [8] recently

deduced that

(i) both ǫ′

r(λ0) and µ′
n′′(λ0) to be positive, and

r(λ0) need not be negative for n′(λ0) to be negative and

(ii) the magnitude of the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(λ0) does not then exceed unity.

Let us emphasize that the spectral regime for n′(λ0) < 0 overspills into the neigh-
borhoods of the regime wherein both ǫ′

r(λ0) are negative.

r(λ0) and µ′

Whereas frequency–domain analysis for the response of a half–space calls for
the determination of the signs of n′(λ0) and n′′(λ0), the refractive index does not

enter time–domain analysis. Therefore, time–domain analysis oﬀers an independent

way of assessing the results of frequency–domain analysis. In this communication,

we present our conclusions from the response of a dielectric–magnetic half–space

with negative real refractive index in a certain spectral regime to a normally in-

cident wideband pulse. The Fourier transform of the reﬂected pulse conﬁrms the

frequency–domain calculations of r(λ0) in that spectral regime, and underscores the
requirement of n′′(λ0) > 0 for real materials (which cannot be non–dissipative due

to causality) to be suﬃcient.

2 Theory in Brief

Consider the region {z ≥ 0, t ≥ 0} of spatiotemporal space. The half–space z ≥ zℓ is

occupied by a homogeneous dielectric–magnetic medium whose constitutive relations

are given by

D(r, t) = ǫ0 [E(r, t) + (χe ∗ E)(r, t)]

B(r, t) = µ0 [H(r, t) + (χm ∗ H)(r, t)]

,

z ≥ zℓ ,

U(t) is the unit step function; pe,m denote the so–called oscillator strengths; while

Ne,m = 2πMe,m and λe,m determine the resonance wavelengths and the linewidths.

The region z ≤ zℓ is vacuous.

At time t = 0, an amplitude–modulated wave is supposedly launched normally

from the plane z = 0; therefore, all ﬁelds are independent of x and y. The initial

and boundary conditions on E(z, t) and H(z, t) are as follows:

Their solution was carried out using a ﬁnite diﬀerence calculus described elsewhere

in detail [11]. It suﬃces to state here that z and t were discretized into segments of

size ∆z and ∆t, respectively; derivatives were replaced by central diﬀerences, and

the leapfrog method was used [12].

possible, following the procedure described elsewhere [11]. The computed ratio of the

Fourier transform of the reﬂected pulse to that of the incident pulse is denoted here

by rT D(λ0), the subscript TD indicating its emergence from time–domain analysis.

3 Numerical Results and Discussion

For the sake of illustration, the following values were selected for the constitutive

parameters of the dielectric–magnetic half–space: pe = 1, pm = 0.8, λe = 300 nm,
λm = 320 nm, Me = Mm = 100. Thus, ǫ′′
However, ǫ′
λ0; while µ′

r(λ0) is negative for λ0 ∈ [212.1, 300] nm, but it is positive for all other

r(λ0) is negative for λ0 ∈ [238.6, 320] nm, and positive for all other λ0.

r (λ0) > 0 and µ′′

r (λ0) > 0 for all λ0.

The deﬁnition of the refractive index in (2) suggests two possibilities: Either

A. n′′(λ0) is negative for λ0 ∈ [236.1, 316.8] nm and positive elsewhere, consistent

with the requirement of n′(λ0) > 0 ∀λ0; or

B. n′(λ0) is negative for λ0 ∈ [236.1, 316.8] nm and positive elsewhere, consistent

with the requirement of n′′(λ0) ≥ 0 ∀λ0.

Thus, our attention had to be focussed on the anomalous spectral regime λ0 ∈

[236.1, 316.8] nm. In this regime, the reﬂection coeﬃcient r(λ0) for Possibility A

is the reciprocal of that for Possibility B. The two possibilities can therefore be

unambiguously distinguished from one another.

The carrier wavelength was chosen as λcar = 240 nm. The pulse duration is

3 fs and its 3dB band is λ0 ∈ [218, 261] nm. Therefore the anomalous spectral

regime was substantively covered by our time–domain calculations. The segment

sizes ∆z = 5 nm and ∆t = 0.015 fs used by us were adequate for the chosen

constitutive parameters, but obviously would be totally inadequate in the resonance

bands of ǫr(λ0) and µr(λ0).

Possibility A is clearly nonsensical. It implies transport of energy in the half–

space z ≥ zℓ towards the interface z = zℓ. Not surprisingly therefore, (2), (5) and

(6) yielded |r(λ0)| > 1 for all λ0 ∈ [236.1, 316.8] nm.

6

Figure 1 presents the computed values of |r(λ0)| obtained from (2), (5) and (6)
for Possibility B (i.e., when n′′(λ0) ≥ 0 is guaranteed for all λ0). The computed val-

ues of |rT D(λ0)| are also shown therein. The two sets of magnitudes compare very

well for λ0 ≤ 290 nm. Examination of the refracted pulse also showed that it trans-

ported energy away from the interface z = zℓ, which corroborates the observations

of Ziolkowski and Heyman [4].

Thus, time–domain analysis validates the conclusion that n(λ0) must be selected
in frequency–domain research in such a way that n′′(λ0) ≥ 0 — irrespective of the
sign of n′(λ0).

The frequency–domain equations (2), (5) and (6) yield the plot labeled FD, after ensuring
that n′′(λ0) is positive for all λ0. The time–domain analysis, followed by the Fourier

transformations of the electric ﬁeld associated with the incident and the reﬂected pulses,

as discussed in Section 2, yields the plot labeled TD. The time–domain analysis fails in

the resonance bands of ǫr and µr because the chosen discretization of space and time

is neccessarily very coarse therein.

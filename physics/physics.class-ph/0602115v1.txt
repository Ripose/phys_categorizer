An improved analysis of the Michelson-Morley-type experiment by P. Antonini et al.

(Phys.
Rev. A. 71, 050101 (2005)) yields the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl theory parameter combination
β − δ − 1/2 = (−0.6 ± 2.1 ± 1.2) · 10−10 and the Standard Model Extension theory parameter
(˜κe−)

= (−2.9 ± 2.2) · 10

1.) As stated in our paper [1] on page 050101-4, the measured value of (˜κe−)ZZ was consistent with a systematic
eﬀect due to variation of the temperature aﬀecting the experiment and therefore we gave its value as a probable
upper limit [2].

In order to characterize the systematic eﬀects more precisely, we have analyzed in detail the correlations between
various monitored parameters and the beat frequency. The monitored parameters were (apart from the two tilt
angles) two laboratory temperatures measured at the top and bottom of the cryostat, and ﬁve temperatures at
diﬀerent positions inside the cryostat.

A linear regression analysis showed that there are strong correlations between these parameters and the beat
frequency. The data was therefore decorrelated, whereby time intervals of 10000 s were decorrelated individually,
in order to allow for changing environmental conditions. This removed to a large extent variations of the beat
frequency with respect to a nearly constant drift.

The isotropy violation analysis was repeated for the decorrelated data. For the rotations considered in [1] the
average is h2Cνi = −2.4 Hz with a sample standard deviation of 1.9 Hz, and h2Bνi = 0.8 Hz, with a sample
standard deviation 2.6 Hz. A large number of rotations performed under diﬀerent experimental conditions allows us
to estimate the uncertainty due to (identiﬁable) systematic eﬀects at 1.8 Hz. The result is (˜κe−)ZZ = −2.9 · 10−14,
with an error of ±2.2 · 10−14, dominated by the systematic eﬀects [3].

We now discuss the arguments given in the comment by Tobar et al.

[4]. Giving a ﬁnal result with an error
equal to the standard deviation of the data, as Tobar et al have done, is certainly both a simple and a conservative
estimate, but the issue is whether this estimate is too conservative. If one believes that the systematics are dominant
(as may be safely assumed for the experiments discussed here) then this statement is simply a statement of the
instability of the apparatus. Even quoting such an error, there is no certainty that the conﬁdence interval includes
the true value, since a partial cancellation between an unknown constant systematic and the signal is still possible.
An experiment can never disprove this possibility.

Tobar et al. state that the systematic signal will cancel if the phase is random. If that is the case, then a correct
statement of the standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean. We disagree with their statement
that it should be the sample standard deviation. In practice it may be diﬃcult to asses how well the systematic
averages to zero, because usually it cannot be clearly identiﬁed. Moreover, a very small number n of data points
(as in the work by Stanwix et al. where n = 5 [5]) makes the calculated mean (in other words, a good cancellation
of the systematic due to random phase) even more uncertain, so that quoting the standard deviation as the ﬁnal
error can be accepted.

We emphasize that bounds provided by a single experiment may still be aﬀected by the presence of a (constant)
systematic eﬀect. However, the results of the three recent experiments [1, 3, 5, 6] are consistent with each other.
Because they were performed by independent groups with diﬀerent techniques, it is not likely that they all exhibit
a strong cancellation between the respective systematics and a substantial nonzero value of (˜κe−)ZZ .

2.) Concerning our statement of the improvement achieved by our experiment compared to previous ones, Tobar
et al assume that we quoted the improvement in the uncertainties of the experiment. However, we did not. In
order to quantify the progress provided by a experiment by a single number we consider more useful to quote the
improvement in the stringency of the test of the acutal hypothesis under study, namely that the speed of light is
isotropic. The previous experiments [7, 8] were consistent (at the 90% conﬁdence level) with isotropy at the level
of |β − δ − 1/2| < 4.1 × 10−9, and 4.2 × 10−9, respectively, while our reported result implied a bound of 5.1 × 10−10.
The latter bound is more stringent by a factor 8, which replaces our imprecise statement ”about a factor 10” given
in the paper.

For better comparison with the work by Stanwix et al. [5] and Herrmann et al. [6], we have analyzed in a similar
way a larger number of rotations (940, grouped in several sets) according to the RMS model. Our result is
β − δ − 1/2 = (−0.6 ± 2.1 ± 1.2) · 10−10, where the ﬁrst uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic, due
to uncertainties in tilt sensitivities and due to laser power variations [3].

On the Deﬁnition of Effective Permittivity and
Permeability For Thin Composite Layers

Abstract— The problem of deﬁnition of effective material
parameters (permittivity and permeability) for composite layers
containing only one-two parallel arrays of complex-shaped in-
clusions is discussed. Such structures are of high importance for
the design of novel metamaterials, where the realizable layers
quite often have only one or two layers of particles across
the sample thickness. Effective parameters which describe the
averaged induced polarizations are introduced. As an explicit
example, we develop an analytical model suitable for calculation
of the effective material parameters εeﬀ and µeﬀ for double
arrays of electrically small electrically polarizable scatterers.
Electric and magnetic dipole moments induced in the structure
and the corresponding reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients are
calculated using the local ﬁeld approach for the normal plane-
wave incidence, and effective parameters are introduced through
the averaged ﬁelds and polarizations. In the absence of losses both
material parameters are purely real and satisfy the Kramers-
Kronig relations and the second law of thermodynamics. We
compare the analytical results to the simulated and experimental
results available in the literature. The physical meaning of the
introduced parameters is discussed in detail.

I. INTRODUCTION

The problem of extraction of material parameters for com-
posite slabs implemented using complex-shape inclusions (of-
ten referred to as metamaterial slabs) has been discussed in
a large number of recent articles, see e.g. [1]–[10] for some
example contributions. The physical meaning of many of the
recent retrieval results is, however, controversial. Typically, the
S-parameter retrieval procedure based on the Fresnel formulae
is used to extract the effective material parameters under the
normal plane-wave incidence. This technique is often known
to lead to nonphysical material parameters that violate the
second law of thermodynamics: Either the real part of εeff
or µeff obeys antiresonance and therefore the corresponding
imaginary part has a “wrong” sign, see [3], [7] for some results
indicating this phenomenon, and [4]–[6] for related criticism.
It is important to bear in mind that even though the afore-
mentioned material parameters might satisfy the Kramers-
Kroning relations (thus being causal), these parameters have
no physical meaning in electromagnetic sense as physically
meaningful material parameters must satisfy simultaneously

both the causality requirement and the passivity requirement
[11]. The above discussed parameters (from now on we do not
use for them the term “material parameter”) allow, however,
to correctly reproduce the scattering results for normal plane
wave incidence.

One particular example of complex slabs, referred to in the
beginning of the paper, is double arrays of small scatterers.
Such slabs present a very interesting problem as in several
recent papers the authors state that double grids of electrically
short wires (or electrically small plates) can be used to produce
negative index of refraction in the optical [12]–[15] and in the
microwave regime [16]. In some cases, however, the nonphys-
ical (antiresonant) behavior is seen in the extracted material
parameters [14], [16] casting doubts over the meaningfulness
of assigning negative index of refraction for these structures.
The goal of this work is to formulate the effective material
parameters for double arrays of small scatterers through the
macroscopic polarization and magnetization, and compare
the results to those obtained using the S-parameter retrieval
method (the reference results are obtained by different authors
[14]). The particles in the arrays are modeled as electrically
small electric dipoles in order to calculate, by using the local
ﬁeld approach, currents induced to each of the particles at nor-
mal plane wave incidence. Knowing the induced currents, the
reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients for the arrays, as well
as the induced electric and magnetic dipole moment densities
(macroscopic polarization and magnetization) are calculated.
Effective material parameters are then deﬁned directly using
the expressions for the averaged ﬁelds and the macroscopic
polarization and magnetization. Finally, the double array is
represented as a slab of a homogeneous material characterized
by effective material parameters.

Since the layer is electrically thin and spatially dispersive,
it
is obvious that an effective material parameter model
cannot adequately and fully describe the layer’s electromag-
netic properties, and, moreover, effective parameters can be
introduced in different ways. It is important to understand
the physical meaning of different effective medium models
and their applicability regions. In this paper we compare the
material parameter extraction based on macroscopic properties
calculated by means of the local ﬁeld approach with the
conventional method based on the S-parameter inversion.

The paper is organized in the following way: In Section II
we use the local ﬁeld approach to calculate the electric dipole
moments induced in the particles and deﬁne the averaged
ﬁelds needed in the determination of the effective material
parameters. The derivation of these parameters is presented in

Section III. In Section IV some calculated example results are
presented, and these results are qualitatively compared with the
numerical and experimental results available in the literature.
Discussion is conducted on the physics behind the results. The
work is concluded in Section V.

β(h) takes into account the inﬂuence of the other grid.

By combining Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), the following system

of equations is obtained for the unknown dipole moments:

II. LOCAL FIELD APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE DIPOLE
MOMENTS AND THE AVERAGED FIELDS

A. Electric dipole moments induced in the particles

Consider a double array of scatterers shown in Fig. 1. At this
point the shape of the particles can be arbitrary, provided that
they can be modeled using the electric dipole approximation.
With this assumption the response of each particle can be
described in terms of the induced electric dipole moment p
which is determined by the particle polarizability α and the
local electric ﬁeld at the particle position.

The array is excited by a normally incident plane expressed

as (see Fig. 1(a))

Eext = E0ejk0z = E0xejk0z.

(1)

The common notation for the wavenumber k0 = ω√ε0µ0 and
for the free-space wave impedance η0 =
µ0/ε0 is used. The
electric dipole moment induced in a reference particle sitting
in the ﬁrst and the second grids reads:

p

p1,2 = α1,2Eloc
1,2,

(2)

where Eloc
1,2 is the local electric ﬁeld exciting the reference
particles. Since both layers are identical in this analysis, the
notation for the particle polarizability is simpliﬁed as α1 =
α2 = α. The local electric ﬁelds can be expressed as

Eloc

1 = Eext

1 + β(0)p1 + β(h)p2,

Eloc

2 = Eext

2 + β(h)p1 + β(0)p2,

(3)

where β(0) is called the self-interaction coefﬁcient and β(h)
is the mutual interaction coefﬁcient. Physically, β(0) takes
into account the contribution to the local ﬁeld of the particles

α−

1p2 = E0e−

jk0h + β(h)p1 + β(0)p2.

Solving this system of equations, the electric dipole moments

and β(h) are exact, so that the energy conservation law is
satisﬁed. The real parts are approximate, and the model is
rather accurate for ka < 1.5 . . . 2 [18]–[20]. Note that the
present deﬁnition of polarizability α includes also the effects
of scattering, thus remaining a complex number even in the
absence of absorption. If there is no absorption in the particles,
the imaginary part of α reads (e.g., [21]):

towards the second grid, and the ﬁeld scattered by the second
grid and propagating towards the ﬁrst grid are considered,
see Fig. 2. The averaged electric ﬁeld inside the slab can be

III. EFFECTIVE MATERIAL PARAMETERS

parameters of an isotropic homogeneous material:

Here P and M are the volume-averaged polarization and
magnetization, p and m are the electric and magnetic dipole
moments induced in the unit cell, and V is the volume of the
H, P, and M for our particular layer
E,
unit cell. Knowing
we deﬁne effective material parameters as:

Naturally, these parameters have more limited physical mean-
ing than the usual parameters of a bulk homogeneous sample,
but they can be used as a measure for averaged polarizations
in a thin layer. Let us next ﬁnd these parameters for our
particular example grid in terms of its geometry and inclusion
polarizabilities.

In order to simplify the forthcoming notations, the sum
and difference of the electric dipole moments with the use

The imaginary parts in the above relations satisfy (25) and

Notice that the permittivity is purely real, as it should be since
the particles in the arrays are lossless.

For our system of two identical grids of small particles
the effective permeability µeff deﬁned by (20) can be also
expressed in terms of the induced electric dipole moments.
Considering one unit cell formed by two particles of length
l with x-directed dipole moments p1,2, we can write for the
currents on the particles (averaged along x) I1,2 = jωp1,2/l.

We can again observe that this quantity is purely real, as it
should be in the absence of losses. Notice that the procedure
presented here can easily be generalized to different particle
geometries.

As is apparent from the deﬁnition, these effective parameters
measure cell-averaged electric and magnetic polarizations in
the layer. Can they be used to calculate the reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients from the layer? This question will
be considered next using a numerical example.

IV. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

In this section, the double array of square patches studied in
[14] is considered as a representative example of comparison
between the effective parameters introduced here and material
parameters formally extracted from measured or calculated S-
parameters.

The geometry of the double-grid array is the same as
considered above (Fig. 1). The unit cell is characterized by
the following parameters: Edge lengths of the patches t = l,
the lattice constants a = b, the metal layer thickness p, and the
distance between the layers equals h. The dimensions of the
unit cell considered in [14] are the following: w = l = 300
nm, t = 20 nm, a = b = 650 nm, p = 20 nm, h = 80 nm.
Since the double array considered in [14] is targeted to the use
at THz frequencies, the metal thickness p becomes comparable
to the dielectric spacer thickness h. The physical thickness of
the slab is D = h + 2p. However, at THz frequencies one
must take into account nonzero ﬁelds inside metal particles
(here gold is considered, which at these high frequencies is
usually characterized by the Drude model (e.g., [11])). For this
reason an effective thickness of Deﬀ = 1.5D is chosen for the
analysis, but we should bear in mind that this is only a rough
estimation, and an accurate determination of this effective slab
thickness is very difﬁcult.

Notice that, as it is stated in [20], the limitation ka < 1.5...2
in the analytical model for the interaction constants (Section II)
is not critical for these calculations until the lattice resonance
at ka = 2π is reached, since the reﬂection properties near
resonances are mainly determined by the particle resonances.
In this case, it means that the model is accurate enough up to
approximately 460 THz.

The following rough estimates are used for calculating the
particle polarizabilities. A known [21] antenna model for short
strip particles is used by setting the particle width equal to
the particle length. The polarizability is resonant and can be
characterized in the microwave regime by an equivalent LC-
circuit, where C is approximated as the input capacitance of
a small dipole antenna having length l and radius r0 = w/4,
and L is the inductance of a short strip having length l, width
w, and thickness t [22]:

(The values of l, w, t are inserted in eq. (34) in millimeters.
The result is in nano-Henrys.) As mentioned above, in the THz
range the behavior of metals is different from the microwave
regime. Following the treatment in [23], the penetration of
ﬁelds inside the particles can be represented by an additional
parallel capacitance Cadd and a series inductance Ladd [23]:

Cadd =

where ωp is the plasma frequency of considered metal (gold
in this case) and leff
is the effective particle length. The
physical clariﬁcation of the above parameters is available in
[23]. Due to the cosine current distribution the effective length
is approximated as leff = 2l. Finally, the particle polarizability
reads:

(C + Cadd)l2

Fig. 3 shows the magnitudes of the reﬂection and transmis-
sion coefﬁcients calculated using Eqs. (12) and (13). Com-
paring this result with the experimental results presented in
Fig. 4a of Ref. [14], good agreement is observed. The shape
of the reﬂection and transmission functions follows the ones
presented in [14]. The differences in the amplitude levels and
transmission frequencies are well expected: The model used
here does not take losses in the particles into account.

The effective material parameters calculated using Eqs. (30)
and (32) are depicted in Fig. 4. Both material parameters
clearly behave in a physically sound manner: They are purely
real, since lossless particles have been considered, and they are
growing functions outside the resonant region. Contrary, the
material parameters extracted in [14] for the same structure
behave in a nonphysical manner: The imaginary parts of
permittivity and permeability have the opposite signs over
certain frequency ranges, thus, the passivity requirement is

violated [4], [5], [11]. It is evident also from Fig. 4c and
4d of Ref. [14] that the extracted material parameters do not
satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations (e.g., the antiresonance
in the real part of permittivity cannot correspond to a positive
imaginary part (with the authors’ time dependence assump-
tion) if inserted into Kramers-Kronig relations), thus, they have
quite limited physical meaning [11]. Both of these problems
are avoided with the method described here. On the other
hand, the material parameters extracted from the reﬂection
and transmission coefﬁcients reproduce these properties of
the layer exactly, while the parameters introduced here do
not necessarily give so accurate predictions for reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients.

This is illustrated next by representing the double layer of
particles as a slab of a homogeneous material having thickness
Deﬀ and characterized by the material parameters shown in
Fig. 4. The standard transmission-line equations are used to
calculate the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients for a
normally incident plane wave. The result is depicted in Fig. 5.
When comparing Figs. 3 and 5 it can be observed that the
results do not correspond exactly to each other, even thought

the principal features such as reﬂection frequencies around
200 and 300 THz seen in Fig. 3 are reproduced in Fig. 5.
This is an expected result: There is no such uniform material
(with physically sound material parameters) that would behave
exactly as the actual double grid of resonant particles. In
a truly homogeneous material the unit cell over which the
averaging is performed should contain a large number of
“molecules” yet remaining small compared to the wavelength.
It is clear that for the considered double array this is not the
case, and also spatial dispersion effects cannot be neglected.
In particular, very close to the grid resonances the induced
dipole moments are very large, which corresponds to large
values of the present effective parameters and to large elec-
trical thickness of the homogenized slab. These large values
correctly describe large polarizations in the grids, but they fail
to correctly predict the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients.
On the contrary, the effective parameters retrieved from the
layer’s S- parameters, correctly describe these reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients, but they do not describe polarization
properties of the actual structure.

It is also important to note that the standard S-parameter
retrieval procedure often leads to nonphysical material pa-
rameters (see the discussion above). The material parameters
deﬁned through macroscopic polarization and magnetization
are always physically sound since they are deﬁned directly
by the actual dipole moments induced in the microstructure.
Thus, the effective material parameters assigned in this way
always make physical sense.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper an analytical model to assign effective material
parameters εeff and µeff for double arrays of electrically small
scatterers has been presented. The induced electric dipole mo-
ments have been calculated using the local ﬁeld approach for a
normally incident plane wave, and the corresponding averaged
ﬁelds have been determined. The effective material parameters
have been deﬁned directly through the macroscopic polariza-
tion and magnetization. The derived expressions have been

validated by comparing the calculations to the numerical and
experimental results available in the literature. The main con-
clusion from this study is that simple effective medium models
of electrically thin layers with complex internal structures
are always limited in their applicability and in their physical
meaning. Some models are best suitable to describe reﬂection
and transmission coefﬁcients at normal incidence (like the
parameters conventionally retrieved from S-parameters), other
models describe well the averaged induced polarizations in
the structure and allow one to make conclusions about, for
instance, negative permeability property (like the parameters
introduced in this paper). In applications, it is important to
understand what model is used and what properties of the layer
this particular model actually describes. Finally, it is necessary
to stress that the present study has been restricted to a particu-
lar special case of a dual layer of planar electrically polarizable
particles. This approach needs appropriate modiﬁcations and
extensions if, for instance, inclusions are also magnetically
polarizable. For slabs containing more than two layers, the
direct extension of this model corresponds to averaging over a
unit cell containing three or more particles, which apparently
is not useful for electrically thick slabs.

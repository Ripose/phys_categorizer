Lorentz Transformation”

Abstract

Rothenstein’s claim of a “faster” derivation of the Lorentz transformation
is not correct.

Many years ago I published a short note “Derivation of the Lorentz transfor-
mation”[1]. A somewhat improved version is posted on my web page under the
title “World’s fastest derivation of the Lorentz transformation” [2]. Recently
Rothenstein has written “A faster than ‘World [sic] fastest derivation of the
Lorentz transformation’ ” [3].

My purpose here is to present my “fastest” derivation and then show that

Rothenstein’s claim of a “faster” derivation is wrong.

Assume:
(A) The speed of light is the same in all inertial frames. (Take c = 1.)
(B) A clock moving with constant velocity v in an inertial frame I runs at
a constant rate γ = γ(|v|) with respect to the synchronized clocks of I which it
passes.

Assumption (B) follows directly from the relativity principle. We do not

assume that the Lorentz transformation is linear.

In the ﬁgure, E is an arbitrary event
plotted in an inertial frame I, L+ and
L− are the two light worldlines through
E, and O is the worldline of the spa-
tial origin of an inertial frame I ′ moving
with velocity v in I. On O,

X ′

= 0, X = vT, and T = γT ′.

Thus on O,

T + X = γ(1 + v)(T ′
T − X = γ(1 − v)(T ′

+ X ′
− X ′

)
).

Since c = 1 in I, an increase in T along L− is accompanied by an equal decrease
in X. Thus T + X is the same at E and F . Likewise, since c = 1 in I ′, T ′ + X ′
is the same at E and F . Thus Eq. (1), which is true at F , is also true at E.
Similar reasoning using L+ proves Eq. (2) true at E. Add and subtract Eqs.
(1) and (2):

T = γ(T ′
X = γ(vT ′

+ vX ′
+ X ′

)
).

(4)

(4), X ′ = −vT ′; the origin of I has velocity −v in I ′.
For X = 0 in Eq.
Thus, switching I and I ′ and using (B), the reasoning for Eq. (1) also gives
T ′ + X ′ = γ(1 − v)(T + X). Substituting this in Eq. (1) gives γ = (1 − v2)− 1
2 .
This completes the derivation of the Lorentz transformation.

Rothenstein writes that my “Assumption B is a cryptic way of presenting
the time dilation eﬀect.” This is not correct: Assumption B does not assume a
speciﬁc form for the time dilation eﬀect. As far as the assumption is concerned,
γ could be identically 1, meaning no time dilation. I derive the time dilation
factor γ in the course of my proof of the Lorentz transformation. On the other
hand, Rothenstein assumes a speciﬁc form for the length contraction eﬀect, his
Eq. (1). This strong assumption is what allows his “faster” derivation. In fact,
a cursory comparison of the two derivations shows that his is not even faster,
despite his strong assumption.

I pointed all this out in a reply to an email from Rothenstein, but received

no reply from him.

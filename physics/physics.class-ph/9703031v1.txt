Abstract

We considered the problem of the proportionality of inertial and gravita-
tional masses in classical mechanics. We found that the kinetic energy of a
material mass point m in a circular motion with a constant angular velocity
around another material point M depends only on its gravitational mass.
This fact, together with the known result that the straight line is a cir-
cumference with an inﬁnite radius, allowed us to prove the proportionality
between the inertial and gravitational masses.

I. INTRODUCTION

The equivalence principle (proportionality of the inertial mi and gravitational mg

masses of a body m) is a postulate in classical mechanics. It was proven experimentally

many times with a high precision. As a matter of fact, measurements veriﬁed that mi

and mg may diﬀer only by a dimensionless factor constant η

mi = ηmg

(1)

Despite the indisputible experimental proof of this principle, a theoretical possibility

of diﬀerence between inertial and gravitational masses is important for the theory (see

e.g. [1-4]). That is why a proof of the equivalence principle, at least in the framework of

Newtonian classical mechanics, is of great interest.

In this report we present the proof.

II. THEOREM OF EQUIVALENCY

A. Kinetic energy of two bodies in a circular motion with a constant angular
velocity

In this paragraph we discuss a well known example from classical mechanics which
showed us a way to prove the theorem. Let us consider two bodies1 m and M with

inertial and gravitational masses mi, Mi and mg, Mg , respectively. The conditions for

their circular motion around the center of inertia (CI) with constant linear velocities Vm

and VM are:

miV 2
m
R − x

= G

mgMg
R2

,

MiV 2
M
x

= G

mgMg
R2

(2)

In Eq.(2) R is the distance between the bodies, x is the distance between the body M
and the CI, (R − x) is the distance from the CI to the body m and G is the gravitational

constant. Eq.(2) expresses the equilibrium of the gravitational and inertial forces for both

bodies. The angular velocities ωm and ωM are obviously equal, because the CI always

lies on the straight line passing through the bodies m and M.

1In the present work we shall consider the bodies as material mass points.

If we ﬁnd the velocities Vm and VM from Eqs.(2,3) and substitute in Eq.(4) we obtain:

The fact that the inertial masses mi and Mi do not enter in Eq.(5) is quite surpris-

ing. The only thing we did was to calculate the kinetic energy without postulating the

equivalency of inertial and gravitational masses. The fact that the kinetic energy does

not depend on the inertial masses prompts us to consider that a theoretical proof of the

equivalence principle is perhaps possible in classical mechanics [5].

We found2 that the expression (5) is also valid in a coordinate system ﬁxed at the

body M.

B. The proof of the Theorem

Theorem: The inertial mass mi of a body m is proportional to its gravitational mass

Proof: 3 We have to prove the relation (1) for an arbitrary body m and for an

arbitrary velocity V . It means we have to show that the constant η does not depend on

the masses mi, mg and on the velocity V of the body m.

First, we shall show that Eq.(1) is true for a given body m with a given velocity V .

So, let some body m (with inertial mass mi) move along a straight line with constant

velocity V . Its kinetic energy is:

From a kinematic point of view, movement with constant velocity along a straight

line and movement with constant (by magnitude) linear velocity along a circumference of

inﬁnite radius are equivalent.

We can also consider the movement of a similar body (with the same inertial mass mi)

as circumference movement around the other body M. The coordinate system is ﬁxed at

the body M. Now we can set that the kinetic energy and linear velocity of body m be

equal to that of case (6). Nothing can prevent us from doing it. From the condition of

the equality of forces we have (see Appendix):

(7)

(8)

miV 2
R

= G

mg Mg
R2

K = G

mgMg
2R

where mg , Mg are gravitational masses of bodies m and M, R is the distance between
m and M. Expressing ”V 2” from (7) and substituting it into the formula of the kinetic

energy of the body m we obtain (see Eq.(5)):

Let us now increase Mg and R conserving at the same time the value of K. In other

words, we consider a series of independent circular motions:

in each of them the same

body m has the same velocity V (and, of course, the same kinetic energy K) and besides,

the values of Mg and R increase appropriately. In this case Mg(R) and R(Mg ) are one-

to-one functions. It is obvious (see (8)) that if K, mg and G are constants, Mg(R) and R

will be linear dependent (proportional) functions, i.e.

Mg (R) = C · R,

where C is some suitable dimensional constant (for the considered mi, mg and V , of
course). After substituting the last formula in (8) and tending R to inﬁnity3 (conserving

3Note that if R tends to inﬁnity, both forces (gravitational Fg = Gmg Mg /R2 and inertial

where mi, mg , C and V have ﬁnite constant values. A constant velocity V when R tends to
inﬁnity means that the angular velocity ω = V /R tends to zero. So we reach a situation without
any forces when the body m moves with a constant velocity V .

at the same time values of K, mg and G) we obtain from (8)

where “GC” has dimension of “V 2”. It means that (9) can be rewritten as

K = mg

GC

K = mg η

,

here η is a dimensionless non-deﬁned constant.

Recalling the above-mentioned remark (equivalence between straight line movement

and the movement along the circumference of the inﬁnite radius), we conclude that the

kinetic energy of the body moving along the straight line with constant velocity is pro-

portional to the gravitational mass. Comparing (10) and (6) we obtain the equality

mi = ηmg,

(11)

where η is a constant non-deﬁned in the framework of the above-mentioned considerations.

Now we have to prove the relation (1) (or (11)) for an arbitrary body m and for an

arbitrary velocity V . It means we have to show that the constant η does not depend on

the masses mi, mg and on the velocity V of the body m.

We shall now show that η does not depend on the velocity V , which the same body can

have if it moves around M but at a diﬀerent distance R. If we apply the same argument

separately for the velocities V1 and V2 of the same body m we will ﬁnd:

In the expressions (12) η1 = GC1/V 2

stants C1 and C2 have a meaning as in (9) but for the distances R1 and R2 respectively.

1 and η2 = GC2/V 2

Now from (12) follows:

mi = η1mg

mi = η2mg

(13)

5

and consequently

η1 = η2 = η

Eq.(14) means that the constant η does not depend on the velocity.

The last point is to prove that Eq.(1) is true for arbitrary masses mi and mg . We

know that (1) is true for a body m with masses mi and mg . Let us now consider another

body

mg proportional with a diﬀerent constant

mi + mi = 2mi ≡ Mi

mg + mg = 2mg ≡ Mg

But we know that mi = ηmg , so

Mi = mi + mi = ηmg + ηmg = η(mg + mg) = η2mg = ηMg

(18)

Eq.(18) shows that the masses Mi and Mg are proportional with the same constant
η. Obviously in this particular case the new masses Mi and Mg are diﬀerent from the

masses mi and mg . It is clear that Eqs.(15-18) can be generalized:

where b is an arbitrary real number. We also have :

mi = bmi

mg = bmg

mi = bmi = bηmg = ηbmg = η

III. CONCLUSION

The proof of the theorem of the equivalency is based on three facts . The ﬁrst is the

well-known result of the Euclidean geometry that a circumference with an inﬁnite radius

R coincides with a straight line. The second is that the kinetic energy of a body m in

a straight linear motion with a constant velocity V is equal to the kinetic energy of this

body in a circular motion with a linear velocity V around the body M. The third fact is

that the kinetic energy of two bodies in a circular motion was expressed only with their

gravitational masses.

In this way we proved that the inertial and gravitational masses are proportional.

Let see now, for ω = const., may we have

Fin = 0,

which could allow us to write the equation of motion (7) in

K? The eq.(24) gives two

equalities:

e

2miωV(rel)y − mi ˙VM x + miω2x(rel) = 0

2miωV(rel)x − mi ˙VM y + miω2y(rel) = 0






After elimination of ω2 we ﬁnd:

2ω(x(rel)V(rel)x + y(rel)V(rel)y) = x(rel) ˙VM y − y(rel) ˙VM x

The left part of (26) is zero, because

(rel) + y2
x2

(rel) = R2(= const.)

and the time diﬀerentiation of (27) gives:

x(rel) ˙x(rel) + y(rel) ˙y(rel) = 0 = x(rel)V(rel)x + y(rel)V(rel)y

(28)

Consequently, for ω = const, the eq.(24) fulﬁlls if the right side of eq.(26) is zero, which

means that the next equality should be true:

x(rel) ˙VM y = y(rel) ˙VM x

x(rel)/y(rel) = ˙VM x/ ˙VM y






V(tr) = VM + ω × R

To verify if (29) is true we shall make some considerations. First, let deﬁne a vector

V(tr):

The vectors V(tr) and VM are collinear because the vectors ω and VM are both perpen-
dicular to the vector R.

where k is a scalar factor. From (30) and (31) we have:

V(tr) = kVM ,

The body M moves around CI with a linear velocity VM which has a constant magnitude

VM .

If we eliminate ω in (32), will ﬁnd:

kVM x = VM x − ωy(rel)

kVM y = VM y + ωx(rel)

x(rel)VM x = y(rel)VM y

x(rel)/y(rel) = −VM y/VM x

˙VM x/ ˙VM y = −VM y/VM x






x(rel)/y(rel) = ˙VM x/ ˙VM y

After time diﬀerentiation of (34) we obtain:

Then from (33) and (35) follows:

So we have found that the relation (36) is true. But eq.(36) is the second equation in (29).

So the eq.(29) and consequently eq.(24) fulﬁll. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to

choose ω = const., for which the equation of motion in the system

K looks like:

Now from (23) and (37) we ﬁnd:

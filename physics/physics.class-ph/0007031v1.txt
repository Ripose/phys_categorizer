Some of the well-known experiments: the ”muon” experiment, the Michelson-Morley
type experiments, the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments and the Ives-Stilwell type ex-
periments are analyzed using the nonrelativistic theory, the ”apparent transformations (AT)
relativity” and the ”true transformations (TT) relativity.” It is shown that all the experi-
ments (when they are complete from the ”TT relativity” viewpoint) are in agreement with
the ”TT relativity” in which the special relativity is understood as the theory of a four-
dimensional spacetime with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry. It is also explicitly shown that,
in contrast to the usual opinion, the commonly used ”AT relativity” does not always agree
with experiments. The concept of sameness of a physical quantity is essential for the dis-
tinction between the two forms of relativity both in the theory and in experiments. The
diﬀerence in this concept causes the agreement of the ”TT relativity” with the experiments
and the disagreement of the ”AT relativity.”

Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed
to fade away into mere shadows and only a kind of union of
the two will preserve an independent reality. H. Minkowski

A quantity is therefore physically meaningful (in the sense that it is of the same nature to
all observers) if it has tensorial properties under Lorentz transformations. F. Rohrlich

I. INTRODUCTION

In [1], [2] and [3] (this paper will be referred as [I]), (see also [4]), two forms of relativity
are discussed, the ”true transformations (TT) relativity” and the ”apparent transformations
(AT) relativity.” The notions of the TT and the AT are ﬁrst introduced by Rohrlich [5], and,
in the same meaning, but not under that name, discussed in [6] too. The general theoretical
discussion of the diﬀerence between the ”TT relativity” and the ”AT relativity” is given
in detail in [I]. There (in [I]) we have also presented the theoretical discussion of the TT
of the spacetime length for a moving rod and a moving clock, and of the AT for the same
examples, i.e., the AT of the spatial distance, the Lorentz ”contraction,” and the AT of the
temporal distance, the time ”dilatation.” In this paper we use theoretical results from [I]
and compare them with some experimental results.

II. GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE COMPARISON

It is usually interpreted that the experiments on ”length contraction” and ”time dilata-
tion” test the special relativity, but the discussion from [I] shows that such an interpretation
of the experiments refers to - the ”AT relativity,” and not to - the ”TT relativity.”

It has to be noted that in the experiments in the ”TT relativity,” in the same way
as in the theory, see [I], the measurements in diﬀerent inertial frames of reference (IFRs)
(and diﬀerent coordinatizations) have to refer to the same four-dimensional (4D) tensor
quantity.
In the chosen IFR and the chosen coordinatization the measurement of some
4D quantity has to contain the measurements of all parts of such a quantity. However in
almost all experiments that refer to the special relativity only the quantities belonging to
the ”AT relativity” were measured. From the ”TT relativity” viewpoint such measurements
are incomplete, since only some parts of a 4D quantity, not all, are measured. This fact
presents a serious diﬃculty in the reliable comparison of the existing experiments with the
”TT relativity,” and, actually, we shall be able to compare in a quantitative manner only
some of the existing experiments with the ”TT relativity.”

To examine the diﬀerences between the nonrelativistic theory, the commonly used ”AT
relativity,” and the ”TT relativity” we shall make the comparison of these theories with
some experiments in the following sections.

III. THE ”MUON” EXPERIMENT

First we shall examine an experiment in which diﬀerent results will be predicted for
diﬀerent synchronizations in the conventional approach to relativity, i.e., in the ”AT rela-
tivity,” but of course the same results for all synchronizations will be obtained in the ”TT

2

relativity.” This is the ”muon” experiment, which is already theoretically discussed from the
”TT relativity” viewpoint in Sec. 3.2 in [I] and from the ”AT relativity” viewpoint in Sec.
4.2 in [I] . The ”muon” experiment is quoted in almost every text-book on general physics,
see, e.g., [7] and [8]. Moreover, an experiment [9] was the basis for a ﬁlm often shown in
introductory modern physics courses: ”Time dilation: An experiment with µ mesons.” Re-
cently, in [10], a version of such an experiment is presented, and it required travelling to
mountains of moderate heights of around 600 m.

In these experiments, [9] and [10], the ﬂuxes of muons on a mountain, Nm, and at sea
level, Ns, are measured, and the number of muons which decayed in ﬂight is determined from
their diﬀerence. Also the distribution of the decay times is measured for the case when the
muons are at rest, giving a lifetime τ of approximately 2.2µs. The rate of decay of muons at
rest, i.e., in the muon frame, is compared with their rate of decay in ﬂight, i.e., in the Earth
frame. In [9] high-velocity muons are used, which causes that the fractional energy loss of
the muons in the atmosphere is negligible, making it a constant velocity problem, while in
[10] one deals with a variable velocity problem. The discussion of the ”muon” experiment
in [I] referred to the decay of only one particle. When the real experiments are considered,
as are [9] and [10], then we use data on the decay of many such radioactive particles and
the characteristic quantities are avareged over many single decay events.

A. The nonrelativistic approach

In the nonrelativistic theory the space and time are separated. The coordinate transfor-
mations connecting the Earth frame and the muon frame are the Galilean transformations
giving that tE, the travel time from the mountain to sea level when measured in the Earth
frame, is the same as tµ, which is the elapsed time for the same travelling but measured in
the moving frame of the muon, tE = tµ. Also, in the nonrelativistic theory, the lifetimes of
muons in the mentioned two frames are equal, τE = τµ = τ. Muon counts on the mountain
Nm, and at sea level Ns, as experimentally determined numbers, must not depend on the
frame in which they are measured and on the chosen coordinatization. This result, i.e., that
Nsµ=NsE = Ns and Nmµ = NmE = Nm, has to be obtained not only in the nonrelativistic
theory but also in the ”AT relativity” and in the ”TT relativity.” The diﬀerential equation
for the radioctive-decay processes in the nonrelativistic theory can be written as

dN/dt = −λN, Ns = Nm exp(−t/τ ).

(1)

The travel time tE is not directly measured by clocks, than, in the Earth frame, it is de-
termined as the ratio of the height of the mountain HE and the velocity of the muons v,
tE = HE/v. The equation (1) holds in the Earth frame and in the muon frame too, since
the two frames are connected by the Galilean transformations, and, as mentioned above,
the corresponding times are equal, tE = tµ and τE = τµ. Hence we conclude that in the
nonrelativistic theory the exponential factors are the same in both frames and consequently
the corresponding ﬂuxes in the two frames are equal, Nsµ=NsE and Nmµ = NmE, as it must
be. However the experiments show that the actual ﬂux at sea level is much higher than that
expected from such a nonrelativistic calculation, and thus the nonrelativistic theory does
not agree with the experimental results.

3

B. The ”AT relativity” approach

In the ”AT relativity” diﬀerent physical phenomena in diﬀerent IFRs must be invoked to
explain the measured values of the ﬂuxes; the time ”dilatation” is used in the Earth frame,
but in the muon frame one explains the data by means of the Lorentz ”contraction.” In
order to exploit the results of Secs. 3.2 and 4.2 in [I] we analyse the ”muon” experiment
not only in the ”e” coordinatization but also in the ”r” coordinatization. As shown in Sec.4
in [I] the ”AT relativity” considers that the spatial and temporal parts of the spacetime
length are well-deﬁned physical quantities in 4D spacetime. (But, of course, Sec.4 in [I] also
reveals that such an assumption holds only in the Einstein coordinatization, i.e., in the ”e”
base, see [I].)

Then, as in the nonrelativistic theory, the equation for the radioactive-decay in the ”AT

relativity” can be written as

dN/dx0 = −λN, Ns = Nm exp(−λx0).

(2)

The equation (2) contains a speciﬁc coordinate, the x0 coordinate, which means that the
equation (2) will not remain unchanged upon the Lorentz transformation, i.e., it will not have
the same form in diﬀerent IFRs (and also in diﬀerent coordinatizations). But in the ”AT
relativity” it is not required that the physical quantities must be the 4D tensor quantities
that correctly transform upon the Lorentz transformations. Thus the quantities in (2) are
not the 4D tensor quantities, which actually causes that diﬀerent phenomena in diﬀerent
IFRs have to be invoked to explain the same physical eﬀect, i.e., the same experimental data.
In the Earth frame and in the ”e” base we can write in (2) that x0
E = ctE, λE = 1/cτE, which
gives that the radioactive-decay law becomes NsE = NmE exp(−tE/τE). In the experiments
[9] and [10] NsE, NmE, and tE = HE/v are measured in the Earth frame (tacitly assuming
the ”e” coordinatization). However the lifetime of muons is measured in their rest frame.
Now, in contrast to the nonrelativistic theory where τE = τµ and tE = tµ, the ”AT relativity”
assumes that in the ”e” base there is the time ”dilatation” determined by Eq.(20) in Sec.4.2
in [I], which gives the connection between the lifetimes of muons in the Earth frame τE and
the measured lifetime in the muon frame τµ as

τE = γτµ.

(3)

Using that relation one ﬁnds that the radioactive-decay law, when expressed in terms of the
measured quantities, becomes

NsE = NmE exp(−tE/τE) = NmE exp(−tE/γτµ).

(4)

This equation is used in [9] to make the ”relativistic” calculation and compare it with the
experimental data.
In fact, in [9], the comparison is made between the predicted time
dilatation factor γ of the muons and an observed γ. The predicted γ is 8.4 ± 2, while the
observed γ is found to be 8.8 ± 0.8, which is a convincing agreement. The prediction of
γ is made from the measured energies of muons on the mountain and at sea level; these
energies are determined from the measured amount of material which muons penetrated
when stopped, and then the energies are converted to the speeds of the muons using the
relativistic relation between the total energy and the speed. The observed γ is determined

4

from the relation (4), where the measured rates were NsE = 397 ± 9 and NmE = 550 ± 10,
and the measured height of the mountain is HE = 1907m. The lifetime of muons τµ in
the muon frame is taken as the information from other experiments (in order to obtain
more accurate result) and it is τµ = 2.211 · 10−6s. In [10] the relation for the ”relativistic”
calculation is written as Ns = Nm exp(−tµ/τµ) = Nm exp(−tE/(γτµ)), Eq.(2) in [10], which
shows that the time dilatation is taken into account by the relation tµ = tE/γ (the same
can be concluded from Eqs.(6) and (7) in [10]). For a given measured ﬂux NsE of muons
at sea level, NsE = 95 ± 10, the expected ﬂux on the mountain is determined from a
nonrelativistic calculation, Eq.(1), and from a ”relativistic” calculation, Eq.(4), i.e., their
Eq.(2). The comparison is made between these expected ﬂuxes and the measured counts on
the mountain. The predicted counts on the mountain ignoring time dilatation (from (1))
= 330 ± 60; predicted counts on the mountain taking into account time dilatation (from (4))
= 190 ± 20; measured counts on the mountain = 183, and diﬀerent error bars are reported
for this measured counts. We see that the nonrelativistic calculation does not agree with
the experimentally found numbers, while the ”AT relativity” calculation (made in the ”e”
base) shows a very convincing agreement with measured ﬂuxes.

Let us now see how the experiments are interpreted in the muon frame. (We note that
both [9] and [10] compared the theory (the ”AT relativity”) and the experiments only in
the Earth frame, but using τµ from the muon frame.) First we have to ﬁnd the form of
the law for the radioactive-decay processes (2) in the muon frame. As considered above
the radioactive-decay law NsE = NmE exp(−tE/τE) in the Earth frame and in the ”e” base
is obtained from the equation (2) using the relations x0
E = ctE and λE = 1/cτE. But, as
already said, the equation (2) does not remain unchanged upon the Lorentz transformation
and accordingly it cannot have the same form in the Earth frame and in the muon frame.
So, actually, in the 4D spacetime, the equation for the radioactive-decay processes in the
muon frame could have, in principle, a diﬀerent functional form than the equation (4), which
describes the same radioactive- decay processes in the Earth frame. However, in the ”AT
relativity,” despite of the fact that the quantities in the Earth frame and in the muon frame
are not connected by the Lorentz transformations, the equation for the radioactive-decay
processes in the muon frame is obtained from the equation (2) in the same way as in the
Earth frame, i.e., writting that x0
µ = ctµ, and λµ = 1/cτµ, (as seen in Eq.(2) in [10], the
relation for the ”relativistic” calculation), whence

Nsµ = Nmµ exp(−tµ/τµ).

(5)

The justiﬁcation for such a procedure can be done in the following way. In the ”AT relativity”
the principle of relativity acts as some sort of ”Deus ex machina,” which resolves problems;
the relation (2) is proclaimed to be the physical law and the principle of relativity requires
that a physical law must have the same form in diﬀerent IFRs. (This is the usual way in
which the principle of relativity is understood in the ”AT relativity.”) Therefore, one can
write in the equation (2) that x0
µ = ctµ,
and λµ = 1/cτµ in the muon frame. With such substitutions the form of the law is the
same in both frames, as it is required by the principle of relativity. Then, as we have
already seen, when the consideration is done in the Earth frame, the relation (3) for the
time dilatation is used to connect quantities in two frames,.instead of to connect them by the
Lorentz transformations. When the consideration is performed in the muon frame another

E = ctE and λE = 1/cτE in the Earth frame and x0

5

relation is invoked to connect quantities in two frames. Namely it is considered in the ”AT
relativity” that in the muon frame the mountain is moving and the muon ”sees” the height
of the mountain Lorentz contracted,

Hµ = HE/γ,

which is Eq.(18), Sec.4.1 in [I] , for the Lorentz contraction, giving that

tµ = Hµ/v = HE/γv = tE/γ.

(6)

(7)

This leads to the same exponential factor in Eq.(5) as that one in the Earth frame in Eq.(4),
exp(−tµ/τµ) = exp(−tE/(γτµ)). From that result it is concluded that in the ”AT relativity”
and in the ”e” base the corresponding ﬂuxes are equal in the two frames, Nsµ=NsE = Ns
and Nmµ = NmE = Nm. Strictly speaking, it is not the mentioned equality of ﬂuxes, but
the equality of ratios of ﬂuxes, NsE/NmE = Nsµ/Nmµ, which follows from the equality of
the exponential factors in (4) and (5). Both [9] and [10] compared the theory (the ”AT
relativity”) and the experiments only in the Earth frame, but using τµ from the muon
frame. In [9] the time tµ that the muons spent in ﬂight according to their own clocks was
inferred from the measured distribution of decay times of muons at rest, and in [10] tE and
tµ are calculated by a simple computer program using the known relation for the mean rate
of energy loss of the muons as they travel from the mountain to the sea level and dissipate
their energy in the medium (such program is necessary since in [10] one deals with a variable
velocity problem).) Since the predicted ﬂuxes NsE and NmE are in a satisfactory agreement
with the measured ones, and since the theory (which deals with the time dilatation and
the Lorentz contraction) predicts their independence on the chosen frame, it is generally
accepted that the ”AT relativity” correctly explains the measured data.

The above comparison is worked out only in the ”e” coordinatization, but the physics
demands that the independence of the ﬂuxes on the chosen frame must hold in all coordi-
natizations. Therefore we now discuss the experiments [9] and [10] from the point of view
of the ”AT relativity” but in the ”r” coordinatization, see [I]. Then, using Eq.(2), we can
write the relation for the ﬂuxes in the ”r” base and in the Earth frame as

Nr,sE = Nr,mE exp(−λr,Ex0

r,E) = Nr,mE exp(−x0

r,E/x0

r,E(τE)),

where x0
frame in terms of the measured quantity x0
”dilatation” in the ”r” base,

r,E(τE) = 1/λr,E. Again, as in the ”e” base, we have to express x0

r,E(τE) in the Earth
r,µ(τµ) using the relation (21) from [I] for the time

x0
r,E(τE) = (1 + 2βr)1/2cτµ.

Hence, the radioactive-decay law (2), in the ”r” base, and when expressed in terms of the
measured quantities, becomes

Nr,sE = Nr,mE exp(−x0

r,E/(1 + 2βr)1/2cτµ),

(8)

and it corresponds to the relation (4) in the ”e” base.
If we express βr in terms of
β = v/c as βr = β/(1 − β) (see [I]), and use Eq.(8) from [I] to connect the ”r” and
”e” bases, x0
E = ctE − HE, then the exponential factor in Eq.(8) becomes

r,E = x0

E − x1

6

= exp n−(ctE − HE)/ [(1 + β)/(1 − β)]1/2 cτµo . Using HE = vtE this exponential factor can
be written in the form that resembles to that one in (4), i.e., it is = exp(−tE/ΓrEτµ), and
Eq.(8) can be written as

Nr,sE = Nr,mE exp(−tE/ΓrEτµ).

We see that γ = (1 − β)−1/2 in (4) (the ”e” base) is replaced by a diﬀerent factor

ΓrE = (1 + β)1/2(1 − β)−3/2 = (1 + β)(1 − β)−1γ

(9)

(10)

in (9) (the ”r” base). The observed ΓrE in the experiments [9] must remain the same,
= 8.8 ± 0.8, (it is determined from (9) with the measured values of Nr,sE, Nr,mE, tE and τµ),
but the predicted ΓrE, using the above relation for Γr and the known, predicted, γ = 8.4 ± 2,
becomes ≃ 250γ,

ΓrE ≃ 250γ.

(11)

We see that from the common point of view a quite unexpected result is obtained in the
”r” coordinatization; the observed ΓrE is as before = 8.8, while the predicted ΓrE is ≃
250 · 8.4 = 2100. Similarly, one can show that there is a great discrepancy between the
ﬂuxes measured in [9] and [10] and the ﬂuxes predicted when the ”dilatation” of time is
taken into account but in the ”r” coordinatization. Furthermore, it can be easily proved
that predicted values in the ”r” base and in the muon frame will again greatly diﬀer from
the measured ones. Such results explicitly show that the ”AT relativity” is not a satisfactory
relativistic theory; it predicts, e.g., diﬀerent values of the ﬂux Ns (for the same measured
Nm) in diﬀerent synchronizations and for some synchronizations these predicted values are
quite diﬀerent than the measured ones. These results are directly contrary to the generally
accepted opinion about the validity of the ”AT relativity.”

C. The ”TT relativity” approach

Let us now examine the experiments [9] and [10] from the point of view of the ”TT
relativity.” In the ”TT relativity” all quantities entering into physical laws must be 4D
tensor quantities, and thus with correct transformation properties; the same 4D quantity
has to be considered in diﬀerent IFRs and diﬀerent coordinatizations. In the usual, ”AT
relativity,” analysis of the ”muon” experiment, for example, the lifetimes τE and τµ are
considered as the same quantity. Although the transformation connecting τE and τµ (the
dilatation of time, Eq.(3)) is only a part of the Lorentz transformation written in the ”e”
base, it is believed by all proponents of the ”AT relativity” that τE and τµ refer to the
same temporal distance (the same quantity) but measured by the observers in two relatively
moving IFRs. However, as shown in the preceding sections and in [I] ,see Fig.4, in 4D
spacetime τE and τµ refer to diﬀerent quantities, which are not connected by the Lorentz
transformation. To paraphrase Gamba [6]: ”As far as relativity is concerned, quantities
like τE and τµ are diﬀerent quantities, not necessarily related to one another. To ask the
relation between τE and τµ from the point of view of relativity, is like asking what is the
relation between the measurement of the radius of the Earth made by an observer S and the

7

measurement of the radius of Venus made by an observer S ′. We can certainly take the ratio
of the two measures; what is wrong is the tacit assumption that relativity has something to
do with the problem just because the measurements were made by two observers.”

Hence, in the ”TT relativity,” instead of the equation (2), which contains x0 coordinate,

we formulate the radioactive-decay law in terms of covariantly deﬁned quantities

dN/dl = −λN, N = N0 exp(−λl).

(12)

muons (here on the mountain; the event O) and their decay after the lifetime τ, the event
T . l, deﬁned in such a way, i.e., as a geometrical quantity, is invariant upon the covariant

velocity 4-vector of S ′ relative to S) and, as l is written in the abstract index notation, it does
not depend on the chosen coordinatization in the considered IFR. Then in the ”e” base and
in the muon frame the distance 4-vector la
µ,OA = (ctµ, 0) (the subscript µ will be
used, as previously in this section, to denote the quantities in the muon frame, while Greek
indices α, β denote the components of some geometric object, e.g., the components lα
µ,OA in
the muon frame of the distance 4-vector la
OA, see [I] for the notation) and the spacetime
length l between these events is lOA = (lβ
µ)1/2. The representation of
the distance 4-vector la
µ,OT = (cτµ, 0), whence
the spacetime length lOT = (lβ
µ)1/2. Inserting the spacetime lengths
lOA and lOT into the equation (12) we ﬁnd the expression for the radioactive-decay law in
the ”TT relativity”

OT in the ”e” base and in the muon frame is lα

µ,OAlµ,βOA)1/2 = (−c2t2

µ,OT lµ,βOT )1/2 = (−c2τ 2

Ns = Nm exp(−lOA/lOT ),

(13)

which in the ”e” base and in the muon frame takes the same form as the relation (5) (the
radioactive-decay law in the ”AT relativity” in the ”e” base and in the muon frame),

Ns = Nm exp(−lOA/lOT ) = Nm exp(−tµ/τµ).

(14)

Since the spacetime length l is independent on the chosen IFR and on the chosen coordina-
tization the relation (13) holds in the same form in the Earth frame and in the muon frame
and in both coordinatizations, the ”e” and ”r” coordinatizations. Hence we do not need to
examine Eq.(13) in the Earth frame, and in the ”r” base, but we can simply compare the
relation (14) with the experiments.

Thus, taking into account the discussion given at the begining of Sec.4 in [I], we conclude
that, in order to check the validity of the ”TT relativity” in the ”muon” experiment, we

8

would need, strictly speaking, to measure, e.g., the lifetime τµ and the time tµ in the muon
frame, where they determine lOT and lOA respectively, and then to measure the same events
(that determined τµ and tµ in the muon frame) in an IFR that is in uniform motion relative
to the muon frame (at us it is the Earth frame). Of course it is not possible to do so
in the real ”muon” experiment but, nevertheless, in this case we can use the data from
experiments [9] and [10] and interpret them as that they were obtained in the way required
by the ”TT relativity.” The reasons for such a conclusion are the identity of microparticles
of the same sort, the assumed homogeneity and isotropy of the spacetime, and some other
reasons that are actually discussed in [9] (although from another point of view). Here we
shall not discuss this, in principle, a very complex question, than we take the measured
values of τµ, tµ, Ns and Nm and compare them with the results predicted by the relation
(14). In [9] τµ is taken to be τµ = 2.211µs, Ns = 397 ± 9, Nm = 550 ± 10, but tµ is not
measured than it is estimated from Fig.6(a) in [9] to be tµ = 0.7µs. Inserting the values of
τµ, tµ and Nm from [9] (for this simple comparison we take only the mean values without
errors) into Eq.(14) we predict that Ns is Ns = 401, which is in an excellent agreement
with the measured Ns = 397. As it is already said, the spacetime length l takes the same
value in both frames and both coordinatizations, le,µ = le,E = lr,µ = lr,E. Hence, for the
measured Nm = 550 and if the distance 4-vectors lα
OT would be measured in the
Earth frame, and in both frames in the ”r” base, we would ﬁnd the same Ns = 401. This
result undoubtedly conﬁrms the consistency and the validity of the ”TT relativity.” (Note
that we cannot compare the experiments [10] with the ”TT relativity” since their tµ, Eq.(7)
in [10], is not correctly determined from the ”TT relativity” viewpoint.)

OA and lα

The nonrelativistic theory predicts the same value of the exponential factor in both frames,
exp(−tE/τE) = exp(−tµ/τµ), since it deals with the absolute time, i.e., with the Galilean
transformations. But, for the measured Nm the nonrelativistic theory predicts too small Ns.
The ”AT relativity” correctly predicts the value of Ns in both frames but only in the ”e”
coordinatization, while in the ”r” coordinatization the experimental Ns and the theoretically
predicted Ns drastically diﬀer. The ”TT relativity” completely agrees with the experiments in
all IFRs and all possible coordinatizations. Thus, only the manifestly covariant formulation
of the special relativity, i.e., the ”TT relativity,” as the theory of 4D spacetime with the
pseudo-Euclidean geometry, is in a complete agreement with the experiments.

D. Another time ”dilatation” experiments

The same conclusion can be obtained comparing the other particle lifetime measurements,
e.g., [11], or for the pion lifetime [12], with all three theories. However, as it is already said,
all the mentioned experiments, and not only them but all other too, were designed to test
the ”AT relativity.” Thus in the experiments [11], which preceded to the experiments [9] and
[10], the relation similar to (4) is used but with tE replaced by HE (=vtE) and τE (the lifetime
of muons in the Earth frame) replaced by L = vτE (L is the ”average range before decay”),
and also the connection between the lifetimes (3) (τE = γτµ) is employed. Obviously the
predictions of the results in the experiments [11] will depend on the chosen synchronization,
since they deal with the ”AT relativity” and use the radioactive-decay law in the form that
contains only a part of the distance 4-vector. The predictions obtained by the use of the ”TT
relativity” will be again independent on the chosen IFR and the chosen coordinatization.

However the comparison of these experiments [11] with the ”TT relativity” is diﬃcult since,
e.g., they have no data for tµ. Similarly happens with the experiments reported in [12].

The lifetime measurements of muons in the g-2 experiments [14] are often quoted as the
most convincing evidence for the time dilatation, i.e., they are claimed as high-precision
evidence for the special relativity. Namely in the literature the evidence for the time dilata-
tion is commonly considered as the evidence for the special relativity. The muon lifetime
in ﬂight τ is determined by ﬁtting the experimental decay electron time distribution to the
six-parameter phenomenological function describing the normal modulated exponential de-
cay spectrum (their Eq.(1)). Then by the use of the relation τ = γτ0 and of τ0 (our τµ), the
lifetime at rest (as determined by other workers), they obtained the time-dilatation factor
γ, or the kinematical γ. This γ is compared with the corresponding dynamical γ factor
(γ = (p/m)dp/dE), which they called γ (the average γ value). γ is determined from the
mean rotation frequency f rot by the use of the Lorentz force law (the ”relativistic” expres-
sion); the magnetic ﬁeld was measured in terms of the proton NMR frequency fp (for the
discussion of g − 2 experiments within the traditional ”AT relativity” see also [15]). Limits
of order 10−3 in (γ − γ)/γ at the kinematical γ = 29.3 were set. In that way they also com-
pared the value of the µ+ lifetime at rest τ +
0 (from the other precise measurements) with the
value found in their experiment τ +/γ, and obtained (τ +
0 = (2 ± 9) × 10−4, (this
is the same comparison as the mentioned comparison of γ with γ). They claimed: ”At 95%
conﬁdence the fractional diﬀerence between τ +
0 and τ +/γ is in the range (−1.6−2.0)×10−3.”
and ”To date, this is the most accurate test of relativistic time dilation using elementary
particles.” The objections to the precision of the experiments [14], and the remark that a
convincing direct test of special relativity must not assume the validity of special relativity
in advance (in the use of the ”relativistic” Lorentz force law in the determination of the
mean rotation frequency and thus of γ, and τ0), have been raised in [16]. The discussion of
these objections is given in [17].

0 − τ +/γ)/τ +

However, our objections to [14] are of a quite diﬀerent nature. Firstly, the theoretical
relations refer to the ”e” coordinatization and, e.g., Eq.(1) in the ﬁrst paper in [14] cannot be
transformed in an appropriate way to the ”r” coordinatization in order to compare the ”AT
relativity” in diﬀerent coordinatizations with the experiments. If only the exponential factor
is considered then this factor is again, as in [9], aﬀected by synchrony choice. Although
the time t in that exponential factor may be independent of the chosen synchronization
(when t is taken to be the multiple of the mean rotation period T ), but τ does not refer
to the events that happen at the same spatial point and thus it is synchrony dependent
quantity. This means that in the ”r” base one cannot use the relation τ = γτ0 to ﬁnd the
”dilatation” factor γ, but the relation (21) from [I] for the time ”dilatation” in the ”r” base,
x0
r(τ ) = (1 + 2βr)1/2cτ0 must be employed. Hence, the whole comparison of γ with γ holds
only in the ”e” base; in another coordinatization the ”AT relativity” predicts quite diﬀerent
τ0 for the same x0(τ ), which is inferred from the exponential decay spectrum.

Let us now examine the measurements [14] from the point of view of the ”TT relativity.”
But for the ”TT relativity” these experiments are incomplete and cannot be compared with
the theory. Namely, in the ”TT relativity,” as already said, it is not possible to ﬁnd the
values of the muon lifetime in ﬂight τ by analyses of the measurements of the radioactive
decay distribution, since, there, the radioactive decay law is written in terms of the spacetime
lengths and not with t and τ. Also, in the ”TT relativity,” there is not the connection between

10

the muon lifetime in ﬂight τ and the lifetime at rest τ0 in the form τ = γτ0, since τ, in the
”TT relativity,” does not exist as a well deﬁned quantity. Thus, in the ”TT relativity,” there
is no sense in the use of the relation τ = γτ0 to determine γ. An important remark is in
place here; in principle, in the ”TT relativity,” the same events and the same quantities have
to be considered in diﬀerent frames of reference, which means that in the muon experiment
[14] the lifetime at rest τ0 refers to the decaying particle in an accelerated frame and for
the theoretical discussion we would need to use the coordinate transformations connecting
an IFR with an accelerated frame of reference.
(An example of the generalized Lorentz
transformation is given in [18] but they are written in the ”e” base and thus not in fully
covariant way, i.e., not in the way as we have written the covariant Lorentz transformation,
Eq.(3) in [I].) Furthermore, in the experiments [14] the average value of γ (γ), i.e., the
dynamical γ, for the circulating muons is found by analysis of the bunch structure of the
stored muon and the use of the relation connecting γ and the mean rotation frequency
f rot; this relation is obtained by the use of the expression for the ”relativistic,” i.e., the
”AT relativity,” Lorentz force law, which is expressed by means of the 3-vectors E and B.
However, in contrast to the ”AT relativity,” and also to the usual covariant formulation, in
the ”TT relativity,” the covariant Lorentz force K a = (q/c)F abub (F ab is the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor and ub is the 4-velocity of a charge q; all is written in the abstract index notation,
[19] and [20]) cannot be expressed in terms of the 3-vectors E and B. Namely, as already
said, in the ”AT relativity” the real physical meaning is attributed not to F ab than to the
3-vectors E and B, while in the ”TT relativity” only covariantly deﬁned quantities do have
well-deﬁned physical meaning both in the theory and in experiments. (The transformations
of the 3-vectors E and B are not directly connected with the Lorentz transformations of
the whole 4D tensor quantity F ab as a geometrical quantity, but indirectly through the
transformations of some components of F ab, and that, in the speciﬁc coordinatization, the
Einstein coordinatization. This issue is discussed in [1] and [4,21], where it is also shown
that the 3-vector E (B) in an IFR S and the transformed 3-vector E′ (B′) in relatively
moving IFR S ′ do not refer to the same physical quantity in 4D spacetime, i.e., that the
conventional transformations of E and B are the AT.) From [20] and [4] one can see how the
Lorentz force K a is expressed in terms of the 4-vectors Ea and Ba and show when this form
corresponds to the classical expression for the Lorentz force with the 3-vectors E and B. Also
it can be seen from [4] that for Bα 6= 0 (Bα is the representation of Ba in the ”e” base) it is
not possible to obtain γu = 1 (the 4-velocity of a charge q in the ”e” base is uα = (γuc, γuu)
and γu = (1 − u2/c2)−1/2) and the covariant Lorentz force K a can never take the form of the
usual magnetic force FB. Hence it follows that in the ”TT relativity” it is not possible to
use the Lorentz force FB and the usual equation of motion d(γmu)/dt=q(u × B) to ﬁnd the
relation connecting γ and the mean rotation frequency f rot, and thus to ﬁnd τ0 from τ /γ, .in
the way as in [14]. The discussion about the kinematical γ (the relation τ = γτ0) and about
the dynamical γ (from the use of the Lorentz force) shows that the measurements [14] cannot
be compared with the ”TT relativity.” But, as we explained before, in contrast to the usual
opinion, these experiments do not conﬁrm the ”AT relativity” either, since if the exponential
decay spectrum is analyzed in another coordinatization, e.g., the ”r” coordinatization, then,
similarly as for the experiments [9], one ﬁnds that for the given N0 the theoretical and the
experimental N diﬀer.

IV. THE MICHELSON-MORLEY EXPERIMENT

These conclusions will be further supported considering some other experiments, which,
customarily, were assumed to conﬁrm the ”AT relativity.” The ﬁrst one will be the famous
Michelson-Morley experiment [22], and some modern versions of this experiment will be also
discussed.

In the Michelson-Morley experiment two light beams emitted by one source are sent, by
half-silvered mirror O, in orthogonal directions. These partial beams of light traverse the
two equal (of the length L) and perpendicular arms OM1 (perpendicular to the motion)
and OM2 (in the line of motion) of Michelson’s inteferometer and the behaviour of the
interference fringes produced on bringing together these two beams after reﬂection on the
mirrors M1 and M2 is examined. In order to avoid the inﬂuence of the eﬀect that the two
lengths of arms are not exactly equal the entire inteferometer is rotated through 900. Then
any small diﬀerence in length becomes unimportant. The experiment consists of looking for
a shift of the intereference fringes as the apparatus is rotated. The expected maximum shift
in the number of fringes (the measured quantity) on a 900 rotation is

△ N = △(φ2 − φ1)/2π,

(15)

where △(φ2 − φ1) is the change in the phase diﬀerence when the interferometer is rotated
through 900. φ1 and φ2 are the phases of waves moving along the paths OM1O and OM2O,
respectively.

A. The nonrelativistic approach

In the nonrelativistic approach the speed of light in the preferred frame is c. Then, on
the ether hypothesis, the speed of light, in the Earth frame, i.e., in the rest frame of the
interferometer (the S frame), on the path along an arm of the Michelson interferometer
oriented perpendicular to its motion at velocity v relative to the preferred frame (the ether)
is (c2 − v2)1/2; the Earth together with the inteferometer moving with velocity v through
the ether is equivalent to the inteferometer at rest with the ether streaming through it with
velocity −v. Since in S both waves are brought together to the same spatial point the phase
diﬀerence φ2 − φ1 is determined only by the time diﬀerence t2 − t1; φ2 − φ1 = 2π(t2 − t1)/T,
where t1 and t2 are the times required for the complete trips OM1O and OM2O, respectively,
and T (=λ/c) is the period of vibration of the light. From the known speed of light one ﬁnds
that t1 is

t1 = 2L/c(1 − v2/c2)1/2.

(16)

Similarly, the speed of light on the path OM2 is c − v, and on the return path is c + v, giving
that

t2 = 2L/c(1 − v2/c2).

(17)

We see that according to the nonrelativistic approach the time t1 is a little less than the time
t2, even though the mirrors M1 and M2 are equidistant from O. To order v2/c2 the diﬀerence

12

in the times is t2 − t1 = (L/c)(v2/c2). Inserting it into △N (15) (the measured quantity △N,
when the phase diﬀerence is determined by the time diﬀerence, is △N = 2(t2 − t1)c/λ) we
ﬁnd, to the same order v2/c2, that

△ N ≃ (2L/λ)(v2/c2).

(18)

This result is obtained by the classical analysis in the Earth frame (the interferometer rest
frame).

2 − t′

1/2 along the hypotenuse of a triangle; in the same time t′
1, i.e., to the right a distance vt′

Let us now consider the same experiment in the preferred frame (the S ′ frame).Since in
the nonrelativistic theory the two frames are connected by the Galilean transformations, it
follows that the corresponding times in both frames are equal, t1 = t′
2, whence
t2 − t1 = t′
1 and, supposing that again the phase diﬀerence is determined only by the
time diﬀerence, △N = △N ′. However, for the further purposes, it is worth to ﬁnd explicitly
t′
1 and t′
2 considering the experiment directly in the preferred frame. Since the speed of
light in the preferred frame is c, the preferred-frame observer considers that the light travels
a distance ct′
1/2 the mirror M1
moves to M ′
1/2, and from the right triangle this observer
1/2 = L/c(1 − v2/c2)1/2. The return trip is again along the hypotenuse of a triangle
ﬁnds t′
and the return time is again = t′
1/2. The total time for such a zigzag path is, as it must be,
t′
1 = t1 (16) (the half-silvered mirror O moved to O′ in t′
1). For the arm oriented parallel to
2,
its motion the preferred-frame observer considers that the light, when going from O to M ′
must traverse a distance L + vt′
3 = L/(c − v). In
a like manner, the time t′
3 + t′
4
is, as it must be, equal to t2 (17) (the half-silvered mirror O moved to O′′ in t′
2). This
discussion shows that the nonrelativistic theory is a consistent theory giving the same △N
in both frames. However it does not agree with the experiment. Namely Michelson and
Morley found from their experiment that was no observable fringe shift.

4 = L/(c + v). The total time t′

3 at the speed c, whence L + vt′

4 for the return trip is t′

3 and t′

3 = ct′

2 = t′

From the theoretical point of view it is interesting to mention an analysis of the
Michelson-Morley experiment which is given in [23]. There, the paths of light are exam-
ined in the case when the experiment is viewed from a frame in which the apparatus is
moving at velocity v (our S ′ frame). It is inquired whether the half-silvered mirror O cor-
rectly reﬂects the light to and from the interferometer arms, such that light travels in the
appropriate ”triangular path” in the transverse arm, and correctly brings the longitudinal
ray into line with the transverse ray at the detector. The result is that if in the classical
analysis the half-silvered mirror is set to exactly 450, then the transverse ray will ”over-
shoot” the desired trajectory while the longitudinal ray will ”undershoot.” The interference
pattern will be dependent on the position of the detector since there is a divergence of the
interfering light rays. The ray angles on the way to the detector are given by Eq.(16) in
[23] The diﬀerence in these angles is exceedingly small (second order in v/c), and hence
negligible in the usual Michelson-Morley experiment.

At this point it has to be noted that there are more serious objections to the traditional
derivation of △N in the nonrelativistic theory and in S ′ than the one mentioned by [23].
These objections are usually overlooked and we only brieﬂy sketch them here. Firstly, in S ′
the waves are not brought together to the same spatial point and consequently the phase
diﬀerence is not determined only by the time diﬀerence. Strictly speaking the increment of
phase φ′

What is overlooked in the usual derivation of △N in the nonrelativistic theory is that not
all ω ′ are the same due to the classical Doppler eﬀect of inertial motion of a source and of a
mirror in the S ′ frame, and that the classical aberration of light has to be taken into account
when diﬀerent k′ in S ′ are determined (this is, in fact, considered in [23]). We shall not
examine the mentioned changes of the classical derivation since △N, obtained with these
changes, will be again diﬀerent from zero.

It is possible to look at the Michelson-Morley experiment from another point of view;
the light ray going both ways in one of the arms of the interferometer can be considered as
a clock, a light clock, with the period determined by the return time of the light ray. The
experiment is then considered as the comparison of the frequencies of two clocks, and it shows
that the relative frequency does not change by a rotation of the interferometer. Such point
of view is important for the interpretation of the modern versions of the Michelson-Morley
experiment.

B. The ”AT relativity” approach

Next we examine the same experiment from the ”AT relativity” viewpoint. Again, as in
the discussion of the ”muon” experiment, we consider this experiment in both frames and in
both coordinatizations as well. First the ”e” coordinatization in both frames will be explored.
It has to be noted that the experiment is usually discussed only in the ”e” base, and again,
as in the nonrelativistic theory, the phase diﬀerence φ2 − φ1 is considered to be determined
only by the time diﬀerence t2 − t1. Further, in contrast to the nonrelativistic theory, in the
”AT relativity” and in the ”e” base it is postulated (Einstein’s second postulate) that light
always travels with speed c.

1 is exactly equal to that one in the nonrelativistic theory, t′

Hence in the S frame (the rest frame of the interferometer) t1 = 2L/c and t2 = 2L/c,
and, with the assumption that only the time diﬀerence t2 − t1 matters, it follows that
△N=0, in agreement with the experiment. In the S ′ frame (the preferred frame) the time
t′
1 is determined in the same way as in the nonrelativistic theory, i.e., supposing that a
zigzag path is taken by the light beam in a moving ”light clock”. Thus, the light-travel
1 = 2L/c(1 − v2/c2)1/2.
time t′
Comparing with t1 = 2L/c we see that, in contrast to the nonrelativistic theory, it takes
a longer time for light to go from end to end in the moving clock than in the stationary
1 = t1/(1 − v2/c2)1/2 = γt1, see, e.g., [7] p.15-6, [8] p.359, or an often cited paper on
clock, t′
modern tests of special relativity [13]. This is the usual way in which it is shown how, in
the ”AT relativity,” the time dilatation is forced upon us by the constancy of the speed of
light. However, in the ”AT relativity,” the light-travel time t′
2 is determined by invoking the
Lorentz contraction; it is argued that a preferred frame observer measures the length of the
arm oriented parallel to its motion to be contracted to a length L′ = L(1 − v2/c2)1/2, see,
2 is determined in the same way as in the nonrelativistic theory but with L′
e.g., [13]. Then t′
1, whence
replacing the rest length L, t′
1 = 0 and △N ′=0, as in the S frame. We quoted such usual derivation in order to
t′
2 − t′

2 = (L′/(c −v)) + (L′/(c + v)) = 2L/c(1 −v2/c2)1/2 = t′

14

illustrate how the time dilatation and the Lorentz contraction are used in the ”AT relativity”
to show the agreement between the theory and the famous Michelson-Morley experiment.
Although this procedure is generally accepted by the majority of physicists as the correct
one and quoted in all textbooks on the subject, we note that such an explanation of the
null result of the experiment is very awkward and does not use at all the 4D symmetry of
the spacetime; the derivation deals with the temporal and spatial distances as well deﬁned
quantities, i.e., in a similar way as in the prerelativistic physics, and then in an artiﬁcial
way introduces the changes in these distances due to the motion.

1, t′

To better illustrate the preceding assertions we derive the same results for t′

2 and △N ′
in another way too. It starts with 4D quantities, but then, as shown in [I] Sec.4.2, connects
only some parts of the distance 4-vectors, i.e., the temporal distances, in two relatively
moving frames using Eq.(20) from [I] for the time dilatation in the ”e” base instead of the
complete Lorentz transformation. Let now A, B and A1 denote the events; the departure
of the transverse ray from the half-silvered mirror O, the reﬂection of this ray on the mirror
M1 and the arrival of this beam of light after the round trip on the half-silvered mirror
O, respectively. In the same way we have, for the longitudinal arm of the inteferometer,
1 = γt1,
the corresponding events A, C and A2. Then, from Eq.(20) in [I], one ﬁnds t′
1 and consequently △N ′=0. But, note, that in both mentioned derivations
2 = γt2 = t′
t′
in the ”AT relativity,” the fequencies of the waves are supposed to be the same in S and
S ′, i.e., the Doppler eﬀect is not taken into account, and the contributions of k′ and l′
to the increments of phase in S ′ are neglected, i.e., the consideration of the aberration of
light in the determination of diﬀerent k′ in S ′ is not performed. Obviously, in the ”AT
relativity,” the same procedure is applied to the calculation of φ′
2 and △N ′ in S ′ as in
the nonrelativistic theory; only, in an artiﬁcial way, the Lorentz contraction and the time
dilatation are introduced into the calculation.

1, φ′

The same experiment can be examined in the ”r” coordinatization. This synchronization
is an asymmetric synchronization, which leads to an asymmetry in the measured one-way
speed of light, but the average speed of light on any round trip is independent of the
synchronization procedure employed, and is = c. In the Michelson-Morley experiment the
measured phase diﬀerence between the phases on the round trips OM1O and OM2O in S,
the rest frame of the interferometer, is synchrony independent, since both waves are brought
together to the same spatial point. Hence, one concludes that the same result △N=0 will
be obtained in the S frame in the ”r” base as in the ”e” coordinatization. However in the
S ′ frame such independence on the used coordinatization cannot be expected. We shall not
discuss this issue here for the sake of saving space, and since there are some more important
problems in the traditional ”AT relativity” derivation of △N.

As already mentioned, it is shown in [23] that the classical analysis of the interference,
in the frame in which the apparatus is in motion, predicts a divergence of the interfering
light rays on the way to the detector. In contrast to this result, the exact parallelness of the
longitudinal and the transverse rays is obtained in [23], but only in the case when, in addition
to the usual analysis in the ”AT relativity,” the Lorentz contraction ”tilt” of the moving
half-silvered mirror is taken into account. The analysis in [23] actually takes into account the
aberration of light, which is overlooked in the traditional derivation in the ”AT relativity”
in the same way as it is overlooked in the nonrelativistic theory. However this analysis
is performed in the ”e” coordinatization and the Lorentz contraction ”tilt” of the moving

15

half-silvered mirror, that is required for the exact parallelness of the rays, is considered in
that coordinatization.
In another coordinatization, e.g., in the ”r” coordinatization, the
Lorentz ”contraction” of the moving half-silvered mirror will be diﬀerent, it can become a
”dilatation,” and one can expect a divergence of the interfering light rays on the way to the
detector. But, as it is already said, the eﬀect is exceedingly small (second order in v/c),
and hence negligible in the usual Michelson-Morley experiment, and therefore it will not be
discussed in more detail.

1. Driscoll’s non-null fringe shift

In [24] the usual ”AT relativity” calculation in the ”e” base (see the discussion above
and also [7], [8], [13]) of the fring shift in the Michelson-Morley experiment is repeated, and,
of course, the observed null fringe shift independent of changes of v, the relative velocity of
S and S ′, and/or θ, the angle that the undivided ray from the source to the beam divider
makes with v, is obtained. However, it is noticed in [24] that in such a traditional calculation
of △(φ2 − φ1) (the change in the phase diﬀerence when the interferometer is rotated through
900) only path lengths (optical or geometrical), i.e., the temporal distances, are considered,
while the Doppler eﬀect on wavelength in the S ′ frame, in which the interferometer is moving,
1), as the traditional one,
is not taken into account. Then the same calculation of △(φ′
is performed in [24], but determing the increment of phase along some path, e.g. OM ′
1, not
only by the segment of geometric path length (i.e., the temporal distance for that path) than
also by the wavelength in that segment (i.e., the frequency of the wave in that segment).
2, in the S ′ frame, between the
Accordingly the phase diﬀerence (in our notation) φ′
ray along the vertical path OM ′
2O′′,
respectively, is found (see [24]) to be

length of the arm OM1 (L, L and ν are determined in the rest frame of the interferometer).
In this expression the Doppler eﬀect of v on the frequencies, and the Lorentz contraction
of the longitudinal arm, are taken into account. In a like manner Driscoll ﬁnds the phase

due to the Doppler shift. From the non-null result (21) the author of [24] concluded: ”that
the Maxwell-Einstein electromagnetic equations and special relativity jointly are disproved,
not conﬁrmed, by the Michelson-Morley experiment.” However such a conclusion cannot be
drawn from the result (21). The origin of the appearance of △N ′ 6= 0 (21) is quite diﬀerent
than that considered in [24], and it will be explained below. Note that in [23] the changes

16

in the usual derivation of △N ′, which are caused by the aberration of light, are considered,
while [24] investigates those changes which are caused by the Doppler eﬀect. Both changes
are examined only in the ”e” base, and both would be diﬀerent in, e.g., the ”r” base. This
means that △N ′ in S ′ will be dependent on the chosen synchronization, and consequently
that the ”AT relativity” is not capable to explain in a satisfactory manner the results of the
Michelson-Morley experiment.

C. The ”TT relativity” approach

Next we examine the Michelson-Morley experiment from the ”TT relativity” viewpoint.
Then the relevant quantity is the phase of a light wave, and it is (when written in the
abstract index notation, see [I] and [19])

φ = kagablb,

(22)

where ka is the propagation 4-vector, gab is the metric tensor and lb is the distance 4-vector.
(We note that in the ”TT relativity” the light waves are described by the 4-vectors Ea(xb)
and Ba(xb) of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (Ea(xb) = Ea
0 exp(ikbxb)), while the ”AT
relativity” works with the 3-vectors E(r,t) and B(r,t) (E(r,t) = E0 exp(i(kr−ωt))), as in
the prerelativistic physics.) The traditional derivation of △N (in the ”AT relativity”) deals
only with the calculation of t1 and t2 in S and S ′, but does not take into account either
the changes in frequencies due to the Doppler eﬀect or the aberration of light. The ”AT
relativity” calculations in [24] and [23] improve the traditional procedure taking into account
the changes in frequencies [24], and the aberration of light [23], but only in the ”e” base.
None of the ”AT relativity” calculations deals with the covariantly deﬁned 4D quantities,
in this case, the covariantly deﬁned phase (22), and it will be shown here that the non-
null theoretical result obtained in [24] is a consequence of that fact. In the ”TT relativity”
neither the Doppler eﬀect nor the aberration of light exist separately as well deﬁned physical
phenomena. The separate contributions to φ of the ωt factors and kl factors are, in general
case, meaningless in the ”TT relativity” and only their indivisible unity, the phase (22), is
meaningful quantity; it is invariant upon the covariant 4D Lorentz transformations (Eq.(3)
in [I] and Sec.3 here), and, as it is written in the abstract index notation, the phase (22)
does not depend on the chosen coordinatization in the considered IFR. (All quantities in
(22), i.e., ka, gab and lb, are the 4D tensor quantities that correctly transform upon the
covariant 4D Lorentz transformations (Eq.(3) in [I] and Sec.3 here), which means that in
all relatively moving IFRs always the same 4D quantity, e.g., ka, or lb, is considered. This
is not the case in the ”AT relativity” where, for example, the relation t′
1 = γt1 is not the
Lorentz transformation of some 4D quantity, and t′
1 and t1 do not correspond to the same
4D quantity considered in S ′ and S respectively.) Only in the ”e” coordinatization the ωt
and kl factors can be considered separately. Therefore, and in order to retain the similarity
with the prerelativistic and the ”AT relativity” considerations, we ﬁrst determine φ (22)
in the ”e” base and in the S frame (the rest frame of the interferometer). Then kµ
ABe and
lµ
ABe (the representations of ka
AB in the ”e” base and in S) for the wave on the
trip OM1 ( A and B are the corresponding events for that trip, as mentioned previously)
ABe = (ω/c, 0, 2π/λ, 0) and lµ
kµ
ABe = (ctM1, 0, L, 0), while for the wave on the return trip M1O,

BA1e = (ω/c, 0, −2π/λ, 0) and lµ
(the events B and A1) kµ
increment of phase φ1e, for the the round trip OM1O, is

BA1e = (ctM1, 0, −L, 0)). Hence the

φ1e = kµ

ABelµABe + kµ

BA1elµBA1e = 2(−ωtM1 + (2π/λ)L),

where ω is the angular frequency and, for the sake of comparison with [24], the length of
the arm OM1 is taken to be L = L(1 + ε), and L is the length of the segment OM2. In
a like manner we ﬁnd kµ
ACe for the wave on the trip OM2, (the corresponding
events for the round trip OM2O are A, C and A2) as kµ
ACe =
(ctM2, L, 0, 0), while for the wave on the return trip M2O, kµ
CA2e = (ω/c, −2π/λ, 0, 0) and
lµ
CA2e = (ctM2, −L, 0, 0)), whence

ACe = (ω/c, 2π/λ, 0, 0) and lµ

ACe and lµ

φ2e = kµ

ACelµACe + kµ

CA2elµCA2e = 2(−ωtM2 + (2π/λ)L),

and thus

φ1e − φ2e = −2ω(tM1 − tM2) + 2(2π/λ)(L − L).

(23)

Particularly for L = L, and consequently tM1 = tM2, one ﬁnds φ1e − φ2e = 0. It can
be easily shown that the same diﬀerence of phase (23) is obtained in the case when the
interferometer is rotated through 900, whence we ﬁnd that △(φ1e − φ2e)=0, and △Ne = 0.
Since, according to the construction, φ (22) is a Lorentz scalar, and does not depend on the
chosen coordinatization in a considered IFR, we immediately conclude, without calculation,
that

△ N ′

e = △Nr = △N ′

r = △Ne = 0,

(24)

which is in a complete agreement with the Michelson-Morley experiment.

connected by the Lorentz transformation, and consequently that the quantities k0
e l0e and
k′0
0e are connected by the Lorentz transformation as well. However the relations (25) and
e l′
(26) are not the Lorentz transformation of some 4D quantity, and really k0
0e do
not refer to the same 4D quantity considered in S and S ′ respectively. Thus in this case too
the quantities k0
0e are connected by the AT, and, as Gamba [6] says, whenever
two quantities, which are connected by the AT, are considered to refer to the same physical
quantity in 4D spacetime we have the case of mistaken identity.

The traditional ”AT relativity” analysis of the experiment deals only with the calculation
of t1 and t2 in S and S ′, (t1 in S is = 2tM1 and ctM1 is only zeroth component l0
ABe (= ctM1) of
lµ
ABe, and similarly for t2 and ctM2). Furthermore, such traditional ”AT relativity” calculation
simply connects, e.g., zeroth component l0

the relation for the time ”dilatation” in the ”e” base, l′0
ACe = γctM2,
although l′0
ACe = γ(ctM2 − βL),
which then yields that t′
1, and consequently one ﬁnds the null fringe
shift △N ′=0. It is clear from this discussion that, in contrast to the usual opinion, the
quantities, e.g., t′
1 and t1, etc., do not refer to the same quantity, which is measured in
relatively moving IFRs S ′ and S, but they are diﬀerent 4D quantities that are not connected
by the Lorentz transformation. Therefore the agreement of he traditional ”AT relativity”
calculation with the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment is not the ”true” agreement,
but an ”apparent” agreement that is achieved by an incorrect procedure.

The whole discussion about the the Michelson-Morley experiment reveals that, contrary to
the generaly accepted opinion, the Michelson-Morley experiment does not conﬁrm the validity
of the traditional Einstein approach to the special relativity, i.e., the ”AT relativity,” than it
conﬁrms the validity of a compete covariant approach, both in the theory and experiments,
i.e., it conﬁrms the ”TT relavitity.”

D. The modern laser versions

The modern laser versions of the Michelson-Morley experiment, e.g., [25] and [26], are
always interpreted according to the ”AT relativity.” They rely on highly monochromatic
(maser) laser frequency metrology rather than optical interferometry; the measured quantity
is not the maximum shift in the number of fringes than a beat frequency variation and the
associated (maser) laser-frequency shift. In [25] the authors recorded the variations in beat
frequency between two optical maser oscillators when rotated through 900 in space; the two
maser cavities are placed orthogonally on a rotating table and they can be considered as
two light clocks. It is stated in [25] that the highly monochromatic frequencies of masers;
”...allow very sensitive detection of any change in the round-trip optical distance between two
reﬂecting surfaces.” and that the comparison of the frequencies of two masers allows: ”...a
very precise examination of the isotropy of space with respect to light propagation.” The
result of this experiment was: ”... there was no relative variation in the maser frequencies
associated with orientation of the earth in space greater than about 3 kc/sec.” Similarly
[26] compares the frequencies of a He-Ne laser locked to the resonant frequency of a higly

19

stable Fabry-Perot cavity (the meter-stick, i.e., ”etalon of length”) and of a CH4 stabilized
”telescope-laser” frequency reference system. The beat frequency of the isolation laser (CH4
stabilized-laser) with the cavity-stabilized laser was the measured quantity; a beat frequency
variation is considered when the direction of the cavity length is rotated. The authors of
[26], in the same way as [25], consider their experiment as: ”isotropy of space experiment.”
Namely it is stated in [26] that: ”Rotation of the entire electro-optical system maps any
cosmic directional anisotropy of space into a corresponding frequency variation.” They
found a null result, i.e., a fractional length change of △l/l = (1.5 ± 2.5) × 10−15 (this is
also the fractional frequency shift) in showing the isotropy of space; this result represented
a 4000-fold improvement on the measurements [25]. In [13] the experiment [26] is quoted
as the most precise repetition of the Michelson-Morley experiment, and it is asserted that
the experiment [26] constrained the two times, our t′
2, to be equal within a fractional
error of 10−15. The times t′
2 refer to the round-trips in two maser cavities in [25], and
to the round-trips in the Fabry-Perot cavity in [26]. These times are calculated in the same
way as in the Michelson-Morley experiment.(see, for example, [13]).

1 and t′

1 and t′

1 and t′

The above brief discussion of the experiments [25] and [26], and the previous analysis
2 in the Michelson-Morley experiment,
of the usual, ”AT relativity,” calculation of t′
suggest that the same remarks as in the Michelson-Morley experiment hold also for the
experiments [25] and [26]. For example, the reﬂections of light in maser cavities or in Fabry-
Perot cavity happen on the moving mirrors as in the Michelson-Morley experiment, which
means that the optical paths between the reﬂecting ends have to be calculated taking into
account the Doppler eﬀect, i.e., as in Driscoll’s procedure [24].
In fact, the interference
of the light waves, e.g., the light waves with close frequencies from two maser cavities in
[25], is always determined by their phase diﬀerence and not only with their frequencies.
Hence, although the measurement of the beat frequency variation is more precise than the
measurement of the shift in the number of fringes, it cannot check the validity of the ”AT
relativity” in the same measure as it can the latter one. Also it has to be noted that the
theoretical predictions for the beat frequency variation are strongly dependent on the chosen
synchronization. Altogether, contrary to the generally accepted opinion, the experiments
[25] and [26] do not conﬁrm the validity of the ”AT relativity.”

Regarding the ”TT relativity,” the modern laser versions [25] and [26] of the Michelson-
Morley experiment are incomplete experiments (only the beat frequency variation is mea-
sured) and cannot be compared with the theory; in the ”TT relativity” the same 4D quantity
has to be considered in relatively moving IFRs and the frequency, taken alone, is not a 4D
quantity.

V. THE KENNEDY-THORNDIKE TYPE EXPERIMENTS

In the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment [27] a Michelson interferometer with unequal arm-
lengths was employed and they looked for possible diurnal and annual variations in the
diﬀerence of the optical paths due to the motion of the interferometer with respect to the
preferred frame. The measured quantity was, as in the Michelson-Morley experiment, the
shift in the number of fringes, and in [27] the authors also found that was no observable
fringe shift. We shall not discuss this experiment since the whole consideration is completely
the same as in the case of the Michelson-Morley experiment, and, consequently, the same

20

conclusion holds also here, i.e., the experiment [27] does not agree with the ”AT relativity,”
but directly proves the ”TT relativity.” A modern version of the Kennedy-Thorndike exper-
iment was carried out in [28], and the authors stated: ”We have performed the physically
equivalent measurement (with the Kennedy-Thorndike experiment, my remark) by search-
ing for a sidereal 24-h variation in the frequency of a stabilized laser compared with the
frequency of a laser locked to a stable cavity.” The result was: ”No variations were found
at the level of 2 × 10−13.” Also they declared: ”This represents a 300-fold improvement
over the original Kennedy-Thorndike experiment and allows the Lorentz transformations to
be deduced entirely from experiment at an accuracy level of 70 ppm.” (my emphasis) The
experiment [28] is of the same type as the experiment [26], and neither the experiment [26]
is physically equivalent to the Michelson-Morley experiment, as shown above, nor, contrary
to the opinion of the authors of [28], the experiment [28] is physically equivalent to the
Kennedy-Thorndike experiment; the measurement of the beat frequency variation is not
equivalent to the measurement of the change in the phase diﬀerence (in terms of the mea-
surement of the shift in the number of fringes). And, additionally, the Michelson-Morley and
the Kennedy-Thorndike experiments can be compared both with the ”AT relativity” and the
”TT relativity”, while the modern laser versions [26], [25] and [28] of these experiments are
incomplete experiments from the ”TT relativity” viewpoint and cannot be compared with
the ”TT relativity.” Furthermore, the ”TT relativity” deals with the covariant 4D Lorentz
transformations (Eq.(3) in [I] and in Sec.3.3 here) and they cannot be deduced from the
experiment [28].

VI. THE IVES-STILLWEL TYPE EXPERIMENTS

Ives and Stilwell [29] performed a precision Doppler eﬀect experiment in which they used
a beam of excited hydrogen molecules as a moving light source. The frequencies of the light
emitted parallel and antiparallel to the beam direction were measured by a spectograph (at
rest in the laboratory). The measured quantity in this experiment is

△ f /f0 = (△fb − △fr)/f0,

(27)

where f0 is the frequency of the light emitted from resting atoms. △fb = |fb − f0| and
△fr = |fr − f0| , where fb is the blue-Doppler-shifted frequency that is emitted in a direction
parallel to v (v is the velocity of the atoms relative to the laboratory), and fr is the red-
Doppler-shifted frequency that is emitted in a direction opposite to v. The quantity △f /
f0 measures the extent to which the frequency of the light from resting atoms fails to lie
halfway between the frequencies fr and fb. In terms of wavelengths the relation (27) can be
written as

△ λ/λ0 = (△λr − △λb)/λ0,

(28)

where △λr = |λr − λ0| and △λb = |λb − λ0| , and, as we said, λr and λb are the wavelengths
shifted due to the Doppler eﬀect to the ”red” and ”blue” regions of the spectrum. In that
way Ives and Stilwell replaced the diﬃcult problem of the precise determination of the
wavelength with much simpler problem of the determination of the asymmetry of shifts of
the ”red” and ”blue” shifted lines with respect to the unshifted line. They [29] showed

21

that the measured results agree with the formula predicted by the traditional formulation
of the special relativity, i.e., the ”AT relativity,” and not with the classical nonrelativistic
expression for the Doppler eﬀect. Let us explain it in more detail.

A. The ”AT relativity” calculation

In the ”AT relativity” one usually starts with the Lorentz transformation of the 4-
vector kµ(ω/c, k = nω/c) of the light wave from an IFR S to the relatively moving (along
the common x, x′−axes) IFR S ′. Note that only the ”e” coordinatization is used in such
traditional treatment. Then the Lorentz transformation in the ”e” base of kµ can be written
as

ω ′/c = γ(ω/c − βk1), k′1 = γ(k1 − βω/c), k′2 = k2, k′3 = k3,

(29)

or in terms of the unit wave vector n (which is in the direction of propagation of the wave)

ω ′ = γω(1 − βn1), n′1 = N(n1 − β), n′2 = (N/γ)n2, n′3 = (N/γ)n3,

(30)

where N = (1 − βn1)−1. Now comes the main point in the derivation. Although the Lorentz
transformation of the 4-vector kµ from S to S ′, Eqs.(29) and (30), transforms all four compo-
nents of kµ the usual ”AT relativity” treatment considers the transformation of the temporal
part of kµ, i.e., the frequency, as independent of the transformation of the spatial part of
kµ, i.e., the unit wave vector n, and thus the ”AT relativity” deals with two independent
physical phenomena - the Doppler eﬀect and the aberration of light. We note once again
that such distinction is possible only in the ”e” coordinatization; in the ”r” base the metric
tensor is not diagonal and consequently the separation of the temporal and spatial parts does
not exist. Thus the ”AT relativity” calculation is restricted to the ”e” base. In agreement
with such theoretical treatment the existing experiments (including the modern experiments
based on collinear laser spectroscopy; see, e.g., [30–32], or the review [33]) are designed in
such a way to measure either the Doppler eﬀect or the aberration of light. Let us write the
above transformation in the form from which one can determine the quantities in (28) and
then compare with the experiments. The spectograph is at rest in the laboratory (the S
frame) and the light source (at rest in the S ′ frame) is moving with v relative to S. Then in
the usual ”AT relativity” approach only the ﬁrst relation from (29), or (30), is used, which
means that, in the same way as shown in previous cases, the ”AT relativity” deals with two
diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime, here ω and ω ′. Then writting the transformation of
the temporal part of kµ, i.e., of ω, in terms of the wavelength λ we ﬁnd

λ = γλ0(1 − β cos θ),

(31)

where λ is the wavelength received in the laboratory from the moving source (the shifted
line), λ0 (= λ′) is the natural wavelength (the unshifted line) and θ is the angle of k relative
to the direction of v as measured in the laboratory. The nonrelativistic treatment of the
Doppler eﬀect predicts λ = λ0(1 − β cos θ), and in the classical case the Doppler shift does
not exist for θ = π/2. This transverse Doppler eﬀect (θ = π/2, λ = γλ0, or ν = ν0/γ) is
always, in the traditional, ”AT relativity,” approach considered to be a direct consequence

22

of time dilatation; it is asserted (e.g. [8]) that the frequencies must be related as the inverse
of the times in the usual relation for the time dilatation △t = △t0γ. It is usually interpreted
[33]: ”The Doppler shift experiments ... compare the rates of two ”clocks” that are in motion
relative to each other. They measure time dilatation (my emphasis) and can test the validity
of the special relativity in this respect.” Similarly it is declared in [30]: ”The experiment
represents a more than tenfold improvement over other Doppler shift measurements and
veriﬁes the time dilation eﬀect (my emphasis) at an accuracy level of 2.3ppm.” Obviously,
as we said, the Doppler shift experiments are theoretically analysed only by means of the
”AT relativity,” which treats the transformation of the temporal part of kµ as independent
of the transformation of the spatial part of kµ.

In the Ives and Stilwell type experiments the measurements are conducted at symmetric
observation angles θ and θ +1800; particularly in [29] θ is chosen to be ≃ 00. The wavelength
in the direction of motion is obtained from (31) as λb = γλ0(1−β cos θ), while that one in the
opposite direction (the angle θ + 1800) is λr = γλ0(1 + β cos θ), and then △λb = |λb − λ0| =
|λ0(1 − γ + βγ cos θ)| , △λr = |λr − λ0| = |λ0(γ − 1 + βγ cos θ)| , and the diﬀerence in shifts
is

△ λ = △λr − △λb = 2λ0(γ − 1) ≃ λ0β2,

(32)

where the last relation holds for β ≪ 1. Note that the redshift due to the transverse Doppler
eﬀect (λ0β2) is independent on the observation angle θ. In the nonrelativistic case △λ = 0,
the transverse Doppler shift is zero. Ives and Stilwell found the agreement of the experi-
mental results with the relation (32) and not with the classical result △λ = 0.

However, a more careful analysis shows that the agreement between the ”AT relativ-
ity” prediction Eq.(32) and the experiments [29] is, contrary to the general belief, only an
”apparent” agreement and not the ”true” one. This agreement actually happens for the
following reasons. First, the theoretical result (32) is obtained in the ”e” coordinatization in
which one can speak about the frequency ω and the wave vector k as well-deﬁned quantities.
Using the matrix T µ
ν , which transforms the ”e” coordinatization to the ”r” coordinatization,
kµ
r = T µ
e, whence we conclude
that in the ”r” base the theoretical predictions for the components of a 4-vector, i.e., for
λ, will be quite diﬀerent than in the ”e” base, i.e., than the result (32), and thus not in
the agreemement with the experiment [29]. Further, the speciﬁc choice of θ (θ ≃ 00) in the
experiments [29] is the next reason for the agreement with the ”AT relativity” result (32).
Namely, if θ = 00 than n1 = 1, n2 = n3 = 0, and kµ is (ω/c, ω/c, 0, 0). From (29) or (30)
one ﬁnds that in S ′ too θ′ = 00, n′1 = 1 and n′2 = n′3 = 0 (the same holds for θ = 1800,
n1 = −1, then θ′ = 1800 and n′1 = −1). In the experiments [29] the emitter is the moving
ion (its rest frame is S ′), while the observer is the spectrometer at rest in the laboratory
(the S frame). Since in [29] the angle of the ray emitted by the ion at rest is chosen to
be θ′ = 00 (1800), then the angle of this ray measured in the laboratory, where the ion is
moving, will be the same θ = 00 (1800). (Similarly happens in the modern versions [30,32] of
the Ives-Stilwell experiment; the experiments [30,32] make use of an atomic or ionic beam as
a moving light analyzer (the accelerated ion is the ”observer”) and two collinear laser beams
(parallel and antiparallel to the particle beam) as light sources (the emitter), which are at
rest in the laboratory.) From this consideration we conclude that in these experiments one
can consider only the Doppler eﬀect, that is, the transformation of ω (the temporal part of

23

kµ; ka in the ”e” base), and not the aberration of light, i.e., the transformation of n, i.e.,
k, (the spatial part of kµ); because of that they found the agreement between the relation
(31) (or (32)) with the experiments. However, the relations (29) and (30) reveal that in the
case of an arbitrary θ the transformation of the temporal part of kµ cannot be considered
as independent of the transformation of the spatial part, which means that in this case one
cannot expect that the relation (32), taken alone, will be in agreement with the experiments
performed at some arbitrary θ. Such experiments were, in fact, recently conducted and we
discuss them here.

Pobedonostsev and collaborators [34] performed the Ives-Stilwell type experiment but
improved the experimental setup and, what is particularly important, the measurements
were conducted at symmetric observation angles 770 and 2570. The work was done with
a beam of H +
2 ions at energies 175, 180, 210, 225, 260 and 275 keV, and the radiation from
hydrogen atoms in excited state, which are formed as a result of disintegration of accelerated
H +
2 , was observed. The radiation from the moving hydrogen atoms, giving the Doppler
shifted lines, was observed together with the radiation from the resting atoms existing in
the same working volume, and giving an unshifted line. The similar work was reported in
[35] in which a beam of H +
3 ions at energy 310 keV was used and the measurements were
conducted at symmetric observation angles 820 and 2620. The results of the experiments [34]
and [35] markedly diﬀered from all previous experiments that were performed at observation
angles θ = 00 (and 1800). Therefore in [35] Pobedonostsev declared: ”In comparing the
wavelength of Doppler shifted line from a moving emitter with the wavelength of an identical
static emitter, the experimental data corroborate the classical formula for the Doppler eﬀect,
not the relativistic one.” Thus, instead of to ﬁnd the ”relativistic” result △λ ≃ λ0β2 (32),
(actually the ”AT relativity” result), they found the classical result △λ ≃ 0, i.e., they found
that the redshift due to the transverse Doppler eﬀect (λ0β2) is dependent on the observation
angle θ. This experimental result strongly support our assertion that the agreement between
the ”AT relativity” and the Ives-Stilwell type experiments is only an ”apparent” agreement
and not the ”true” one.

B. The ”TT relativity” approach

As already said in the ”TT relativity” neither the Doppler eﬀect nor the aberration of
light exist separately as well deﬁned physical phenomena. As shown in Sec.3.3 here and in
[I] , in 4D spacetime the temporal distances (e.g., τE and τµ) refer to diﬀerent quantities,
which are not connected by the Lorentz transformation; the same happens with ω and ω ′ as
the temporal parts of kµ. And, as Gamba [6] stated, the fact that the measurements of such
quantities were made by two observers does not mean that relativity has something to do
with the problem. In the ”TT relativity” the entire 4D quantity has to be considered both in
the theory and in experiments. Therefore, in order to theoretically discuss the experiments
of the Ives-Stilwell type we choose as the relevant quantity the wave vector ka and its square,
for which it holds that

kagabkb = 0.

(33)

First we consider the experiments [34] and [35] since they showed the disagreement with the
traditional theory, i.e., with the ”AT relativity.” The product kagabkb is a Lorentz scalar

24

and it is also independent of the choice of the coordinatization. Hence we can calculate that
product kagabkb in the ”e” base and in the rest frame of the emitter (the S ′ frame); the
emitter is the ion moving in S, the rest frame of the spectrometer, i.e., in the laboratory
frame. Then ka in the ”e” base and in S ′ is represented by k′µ = (ω ′/c)(1, cos θ′, sin θ′, 0)
and k′µk′
µ = 0. The observer (the spectrometer) in the laboratory frame will look at the
same 4D quantity ka and ﬁnd the Lorentz transformed wave vector kµ as

kµ = [γ(ω ′/c)(1 + β cos θ′), γ(ω ′/c)(cos θ′ + β), (ω ′/c) sin θ′, 0] ,

whence kµkµ is also = 0. From that transformation one can ﬁnd that

n1 = (n′1 + β)/(1 + βn′1), n2 = n′2/γ(1 + βn′1), n3 = n′3/γ(1 + βn′1),

or that

sin θ = sin θ′/γ(1 + β cos θ′), cos θ = (cos θ′ + β)/(1 + β cos θ′),

tan θ = sin θ′/γ(β + cos θ′).

(34)

The relation (34) reveals that not only ω is changed (the Doppler eﬀect) when going from
S ′ to S than also the angle of k relative to the direction of v is changed (the aberration of
light). This means that if the observation of the unshifted line (i.e., of the frequency ω ′ = ω0
from the atom at rest) is performed at an observation angle θ′ in S ′, the rest frame of the
emitter, then the same light wave (from the same but now moving atom) will have the shifted
frequency ω and will be seen at an observation angle θ (generally, 6= θ′) in S, the rest frame
of the spectrometer. In S ′ the quantities ω ′ and θ′ deﬁne k′µ, and this propagation 4-vector
satisﬁes the relation k′µk′
µ = 0, which is the representation of the relation (33) in the ”e”
base and in the S ′ frame. The quantities ω ′ and θ′ are connected with the corresponding ω
and θ, that deﬁne the corresponding kµ in S, by the ”e” base Lorentz transformation of k′µ.
Then kµ is such that it also satisﬁes the relation kµkµ = 0 (the representation of the same
relation (33) in the ”e” base and now in the S frame). The authors of the experiments [34]
(and [35]) made the observation of the radiation from the atom at rest (the unshifted line)
and from a moving atom at the same observation angle. The preceding discussion shows
that if they succeeded to see ω0 (λ0) from the atom at rest at some symmetric observation
angles θ′ (6= 0) and θ′ + 1800 than they could not see the assymetric Doppler shift (from
moving atoms) at the same angles θ = θ′ (and θ′ + 1800). This was the reason that they
detected △λ ≃ 0 and not △λ ≃ λ0β2. But we expect that the result △λ ≃ λ0β2 can be seen
if the similar measurements of the frequencies, i.e., the wavelengths, of the radiation from
moving atoms would be performed not at θ = θ′ than at θ determined by the relation (34).
Recently, Bekljamishev [36] came to the same conclusions and explained the results of
the experiments [34] and [35] taking into account the aberration of light together with the
Doppler eﬀect. It is argued in [36] that Eq.(31) for the Doppler eﬀect can be realized only
when the condition for the aberration angle is fulﬁlled,

△ θ = β sin θ′,

(35)

where △θ = θ′ − θ, and β is taken to be β ≪ 1. The relation (35) directly follows from the
expression for sin θ in (34) taking that β ≪ 1. The assymetric shift will be seen when the

25

collimator assembly is tilted at a velocity dependent angle △θ. Instead of to work, as usual,
with the arms of the collimator at ﬁxed angles θ and θ + 1800, Bekljamishev [36] proposed
that the collimator assembly must be constructed in such a way that there is the possibility
of the correction of the observation angles independently for both arms; for example, the
arm at angle θ (θ + 1800) has to be tilted clockwise (counter-clockwise) by the aberration
angle △θ. Otherwise the assymetry in the Doppler shifts will not be observed. Thus the
experiments [34] and [35] would need to be repeated taking into account Bekljamishev’s
proposition. The positive result for the Doppler shift △λ (32), when the condition for the
aberration angle △θ (35) is fulﬁlled, will deﬁnitely show that it is not possible to treat the
Doppler eﬀect and the aberration of light as separate, well-deﬁned, eﬀects, i.e., that it is the
”TT relativity,” and not the ”AT relativity,” which correctly explains the experiments that
test the special relativity.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The analysis of the experiments which test the special relativity shows that they agree
with the predictions of the ”TT relativity” and not, as usually supposed, with those of the
”AT relativity.”

In the ”muon” experiment the ﬂuxes of muons on a mountain, Nm, and at sea level,
Ns, are measured. The ”AT relativity” predicts diﬀerent values of the ﬂux Ns (for the
same measured Nm) in diﬀerent synchronizations, but the measured Ns is independent of
the chosen coordinatization. Further, for some synchronizations these predicted values of
the ﬂux at sea level Ns are quite diﬀerent than the measured ones. The reason for such
disagreement, as explained in the text, is that in the usual, ”AT relativity,” analysis of the
”muon” experiment, for example, the lifetimes τE and τµ are considered to refer to the same
temporal distance (the same quantity) measured by the observers in two relatively moving
IFRs. But the transformation connecting τE and τµ (the dilatation of time) is only a part of
the Lorentz transformation written in the ”e” base, and, actually, τE and τµ refer to diﬀerent
quantities in 4D spacetime. Although their measurements were made by two observers, the
relativity has nothing to do with the problem, since τE and τµ are diﬀerent 4D quantities.
The ”TT relativity,” in contrast to the ”AT relativity,” completely agrees with the ”muon”
experiments in all IFRs and all possible coordinatizations. In the ”TT relativity” the same
4D quantity is considered in diﬀerent IFRs and diﬀerent coordinatizations; instead of to
work with τE and τµ the ”TT relativity” deals with the spacetime length l and formulate
the radioactive-decay law in terms of covariantly deﬁned quantities.

In the Michelson-Morley experiment the traditional, ”AT relativity,” derivation of the
fring shift △N deals only with the calculation, in the ”e” base, of path lengths (optical or
geometrical) in S and S ′, or, in other words, with the calculation of t1 and t2 (in S and S ′),
which are the times required for the complete trips OM1O and OM2O along the arms of
the Michelson-Morley interferometer. The null fringe shift obtained with such calculation
is only in an ”apparent,” not ”true,” agreement with the observed null fringe shift, since
this agreement was obtained by an incorrect procedure. Namely it is supposed in such
derivation that, e.g., t1 and t′
1 refer to the same quantity measured by the observers in
relatively moving IFRs S and S ′ that are connected by the Lorentz transformation. However
the relation t′
1 and t1 do

1 = γt1 is not the Lorentz transformation of some 4D quantity, and t′

26

not correspond to the same 4D quantity considered in S ′ and S respectively. The improved
”AT relativity” calculation from [24] (again in the ”e” base) determines the increment of
phase along some path not only by the segment of geometric path length than also by the
wavelength in that segment, and ﬁnds a non-null fringe shift. But we show that the non-null
theoretical result for the fringe shift, which is obtained in [24], is a consequence of the fact
that again two diﬀerent quantities k0
0e (only the parts of the covariantly deﬁned
phase (22) φ = kagablb) are considered to refer to the same 4D quantity, and thus that these
two quantities are connected by the Lorentz transformation. The ”TT relativity,” in contrast
to the ”AT relativity” calculations, deals always with the covariantly deﬁned 4D quantities
(in the Michelson-Morley experiment, e.g., the covariantly deﬁned phase (22) φ = kagablb),
which are connected by the Lorentz transformation. The ”TT relativity” calculations yields
the observed null fringe shift and that result holds for all IFRs and all coordinatizations.

el0e and k′0
e l′

The same conclusions can be drawn for the Kennedy-Thorndike type experiments.
In the Ives-Stilwell type experiments the agreement between the ”AT relativity” calcu-
lation for the Doppler eﬀect and the experiments is again only an ”apparent” agreement
and not the ”true” one. Namely the transverse Doppler shift (λ0β2, (32)) is obtained in the
”e” coordinatization in which one can speak about the frequency ω and the wave vector k
as well-deﬁned quantities. Further in the usual ”AT relativity” approach only the transfor-
mation of ω (the temporal part of kµ) is considered, while the aberration of light, i.e., the
transformation of n, i.e., k, (the spatial part of kµ) is neglected. Thus in this case too the
”AT relativity” deals with two diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime, ω and ω ′, which are not
connected by the Lorentz transformation. However, for the speciﬁc choice of the observation
angles θ′ = 00 (1800) in S ′ (the rest frame of the emitter), one ﬁnds from the transformation
of kµ that θ in S is again = 00 (1800). Since in the experiments [29], and its modern versions
[30,32], just such angles were chosen, it was possible to consider only the transformation of
ω, i.e., only the Doppler eﬀect, and not the concomitant aberration of light, and because
of that they found the agreement between the relation (31) (or (32)) and the experiments.
When the experiments were performed at observation angles θ 6= 00 (and 1800), as in [34]
and [35], the results disagreed with the ”AT relativity” calculation which takes into account
only the transformation of ω, i.e., only the Doppler eﬀect. The ”TT relativity” calculation
considers the same 4D quantity the wave vector ka (or its square) in S and S ′, i.e., it con-
siders the Doppler eﬀect and the aberration of light together as unseparated phenomena.
The results of such calculation agrees with the experiments [29] and [30,32] (made at θ = 00
(1800)), but also predict the positive result for the Doppler shift △λ (32) in the experiments
of the type [34] and [35], if the condition for the aberration angle △θ (35) is fulﬁlled, which
agrees with Bekljamishev’s explanation [36] of the experiments [34] and [35].

The discussion in this paper clearly shows that the ”TT relativity” completely agrees
with all considered experiments, in all IFRs and all possible coordinatizations, while the
”AT relativity” appears as an unsatisfactory relativistic theory. These results are directly
contrary to the generally accepted opinion about the validity of the ”AT relativity.”

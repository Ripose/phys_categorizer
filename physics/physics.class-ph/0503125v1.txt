The ratchet eﬀect [1-3], induced by symmetry breaking of temporal forces

both in the presence and in the absence of noise, has attracted a great deal

of attention in recent years [4-17], partly because of its clear applicability to

such diverse ﬁelds as biology, and micro- and nano-technology [2,18-22]. While

the dependence of the directed transport on each of the ratchet-controlling pa-

rameters has been individually investigated experimentally, theoretically, and

numerically, there is still no general criterion to apply to the whole set of these

parameters to optimally control directed transport in general systems. Here we

show that the mechanism ultimately responsible for any change in the averages

of relevant observables is the change of the degree of breaking of the aforemen-

tioned temporal symmetries. We demonstrate that this degree of symmetry

breaking (DSB) mechanism provides a universal criterion to optimize any ap-

plication of the ratchet eﬀect, such as electronic transport through molecules

[11], smoothing surfaces [23], controlling vortex density in superconductors [21],

separating particles [24], controlling directed current in semiconductors [6], and

rectifying the phase across a SQUID [25]. In particular, we discuss the mecha-

nism through the problem of kink-asisted directed energy transport in soliton

systems.

2

Consider a general system (classical or quantum, dissipative or non-dissipative, uni- or

multidimensional, noisy or noiseless) where a ratchet eﬀect is induced by solely violating

temporal symmetries of a T -periodic zero-mean ac force f (t) which drives the system. A

popular choice would be the simple case of a biharmonic force,

f (t) = ǫ1har1 (ωt + ϕ1) + ǫ2har2 (2ωt + ϕ2) ,

(1)

where har1,2 represents indistinctly sin or cos. In this case, the aforementioned symmetries

are the shift symmetry (Ss : f (t) =

f (t + T /2)) and the time-reversal symmetries (Str,± :

−

f (

t) =

f (t)). Now the general unsolved problem is to ﬁnd the regions of the parameter

−

±

space (ǫ2, ϕ1, ϕ2) where the ratchet eﬀect is optimal in the sense that the average of relevant

observables is maximal, the remaining parameters being held constant. We show in the

following that such regions are those where the eﬀective degree of symmetry breaking is

maximal. Without loss of generality, we shall illustrate the DSB mechanism by using the

following working model for the driving force:

fellip(t) = ǫf (t; T, m, θ)

ǫ sn (Ωt + Θ; m) cn (Ωt + Θ; m) ,

waveform changes as the shape parameter m varies from 0 to 1 (see Fig. 1, top panel).

Physically, the motivation of choice (2) is that fellip(t; T, m = 0, θ) = ǫ sin (2πt/T + θ) /2,

and that fellip(t; T, m = 1, θ) vanishes except on a set of instants that has Lebesgue measure

zero, i.e., in these two limits directed transport is not possible, while it is expected for

0 < m < 1. Thus, one may expect in general the average of any relevant observable

to

ℜ

exhibit an extremum at a certain value m = me as the shape parameter m is varied, the

remaining parameters being held constant. Clearly, two competing fundamental mechanisms

allow one to understand the appearance of such extremum: the increase of the degree of

breaking of the shift symmetry as m is increased, which increases the absolute value of the

average, and the eﬀective narrowing of the force pulse as m is increased, which decreases

the absolute value of the average. The former mechanism arises from the fact that a broken

symmetry is a structurally stable situation (Curie’s principle) and can be quantitatively

3

characterized by noting that

where dn (

of deviation from the shift symmetry condition (D (t; T, m, θ)

1) increases as m

≡

irrespective of the values of the period and initial phase (see Fig. 1, middle panel). Thus,

while increasing the shape parameter from m (0 < m < me) improves the directed transport

yielding a higher average, it simultaneously narrows the pulse force lowering the driving

eﬀectiveness of the force.

Indeed, the latter becomes the dominant eﬀect for suﬃciently

narrow pulses (m > me). We chose the function (2) to satisfy the requirement that me be

suﬃciently far from 1 so that the elliptic force is eﬀectively approximated by its ﬁrst two

harmonics. One thus obtains a relationship between the amplitudes of the two harmonics

in parametric form: ǫ1,2 = ǫ1,2(m). This relationship does not depend on the initial phase

θ, and hence neither does it depend on the breaking of time-reversal symmetries of the

biharmonic approximation corresponding to the elliptic force. For a general biharmonic

force (1), this means according to the DSB mechanism that the optimal ratchet-inducing

values of the initial phases ϕ1, ϕ2 should be those giving a maximal breaking of one of the

two time-reversal symmetries of the force (depending upon each particular system, see Table

I), while the relationship ǫ2 = ǫ2(ǫ1) should control solely the degree of breaking of the shift
symmetry. Note that this symmetry is broken for all ϕ2 6
ϕ1, while for ϕ2 = π the directed transport would simply change its direction in any case.

= π irrespective of the value of

Consequently, if the DSB mechanism is right, the relationship ǫ2 = ǫ2(ǫ1) controlling the

degree of breaking of the shift symmetry should be independent of whichever particular

system where directed transport is induced. This implies that any averaged observable <

> should be proportional to a certain function g (ǫ1, ǫ2) which is

ℜ
order, with p1 (ǫ1) , p (ǫ2) being polynomials. The transformation ǫ2 → −
implies that the directed transport changes (maintains) its direction (cf. Table I; recall

that the shift symmetry is not broken by any ϕ1). This means that p1 (ǫ1) and p2 (ǫ2)

are even and odd functions, respectively. Since the aforementioned extremum is scale-

independent, one deﬁnes ǫ1 = ǫ (1

taking ǫ = 1 without loss of generality. The problem thus reduces to ﬁnding the polynomials

p1(α)p2 (α) has a single extremum on the interval (0, 1). The only function satisfying all

these requirements in leading order is (1

theoretical analyses of every kind on a great diversity of systems [5-7,9,10,13,14,16,17] have

found that the averaged observable is always proportional to such a factor in leading order.

for the biharmonic approximation corresponding to the elliptic force. Therefore, the shape

function S(m) is a universal function which controls the breaking of the shift symmetry in

leading order. It presents a single maximum at m = 0.960057

me for which ǫ2 = ǫ2(ǫ1)

≃

ǫ1/2 (note that ǫ2 = ǫ1/2 for m = 0.983417; see Fig. 1, bottom panel).

We found that the DSB mechanism conﬁrms and explains all the previous experi-

mental, theoretical, and numerical results for a great diversity of systems subjected to

a biharmonic force (1) [5-7,9,10,13,14,16,17].

In particular,

it explains recent experi-

mental results of directed diﬀusion in a symmetric optical lattice [12], where the force

F = (constant) [(1

B) cos (ωt) + B cos (2ωt

φ)] yielded the maximum velocity of the

centre-of-mass of the atomic cloud at B

0.33, φ = π/2, and the complete data series ﬁtted

the functional form (1

B)2B (i.e., ǫ2

1ǫ2), in conﬁrmation of the predictions above. Also, the

DSB mechanism works powerfully in the case of electron transport through a molecular wire

weakly coupled to two leads and subjected to a biharmonic (A1 sin (Ωt) + A2 sin (2Ωt + φ))

laser ﬁeld [11]. Quantum calculations showed [11] that only when the symmetry break-

ing is maximal (i.e., A2 = A1/2, φ = π/2) does average current reach its maximum value,

and the average current is proportional to the coupling strength. For weak coupling, this

maximum is about ﬁve orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value at φ = 0.

We here studied the example of kink-asisted directed energy transport in a driven, damped

sine-Gordon (sG) equation (see Fig. 2), where directed energy transport requires a non-zero

topological charge, implying the existence of sG solitons (kinks) in the system. As Fig.

2 shows, the theoretical predictions are conﬁrmed by numerical simulations. Although we

have here limited ourselves to temporal symmetries, the DSB mechanism applies to spatial

symmetries as well.

In this regard, the waveform corresponding to m = 0.96 in Fig. 1

suggests that the ratchet potential underlying biological motor proteins might be optimized

according to the DSB mechanism. We would stress that the consequences of the DSB mech-

5

anism extend beyond the problem of directed transport.

It applies, for example, to the

phenomenon of synchronization of arrays of coupled limit-cycle oscillators [26], where the

maximal symmetry breaking of a homogeneous, time-delayed, and periodic coupling gave

the maximum decrease of the synchronization frequency (see Fig. 3). Finally, since the

DSB mechanism is scale-independent, the critical value me could well be deﬁned by a purely

geometric condition, A(m = me)/A(m = 0) = Φ/2, where Φ =

/2 is the golden

ratio and A(m)

fellip(t; T, m, θ = 0)dt. This gives me = 0.9830783..., but for the

Abstract. A general law for electromagnetic induction phenomena is derived from
Lorentz force and Maxwell equation connecting electric ﬁeld and time variation
of magnetic ﬁeld. The derivation provides with a uniﬁed mathematical treatment
the statement according to which electromagnetic induction is the product of two
independent phenomena: time variation of magnetic ﬁeld and eﬀects of magnetic
ﬁeld on moving charges. The general law deals easily - without ad hoc assumptions -
with typical cases usually considered as exceptions to the ﬂux rule and contains the
ﬂux rule as a particular case.

1 Introduction

It is, in general, acknowledged that the theoretical treatment of electromagnetic
induction phenomena presents some problems when part of the electrical circuit is
moving. Some authors speak of exceptions to the ﬂux rule;1 others save the ﬂux rule
by ad hoc choices of the integration line over which the induced emf is calculated.
Several attempts to overcome these diﬃculties have been made; a comprehensive one
has been performed by Scanlon, Henriksen and Allen.2 However, their treatment -
as others - fails to recognize that one must distinguish between the velocity of the
circuit elements and the velocity of the electrical charges (see section 2 below).
Therefore, these authors reestablish the ﬂux rule and, consequently, do not solve
the problems posed by its application.

Since 1992, I have been teaching electromagnetism in a course for Mathematics
students and I had to deal with the problems outlined above. I have found that
it is possible to get a general law for electromagnetic induction that contains the
standard ﬂux rule as a particular case.

The matter has conceptual relevance; it has also historical and epistemological
aspects that deserve to be investigated. Therefore, it is, perhaps, worthwhile to
submit the following considerations to the attention of a public wider than that of
my students.

2 A general law for electromagnetic induction

Textbooks show a great variety of positions about how the ﬂux rule can be applied
to the known experimental phenomena of electromagnetic induction. Among the
more lucid approaches, let us refer to the treatment given by Feynman, Leighton
and Sands in the Feynman Lectures on Physics. They write:

In general, the force per unit charge is ~F /q = ~E + ~v × ~B. In moving
wires there is the force from the second term. Also, there is an ~E ﬁeld if
there is somewhere a changing magnetic ﬁeld. They are two independent
eﬀects, but the emf around the loop of wire is always equal to the rate
of change of magnetic ﬂux through it.3

This sentence is followed by a paragraph entitled Exceptions to the “ﬂux rule”,
where the authors treat two cases - the Faraday disc and the ‘rocking plates’ - both

characterized by the fact that there is a part of the circuit in which the material of
the circuit is changing. As the authors put it, at the end of the discussion:4

The ‘ﬂux rule does not work in this case. It must be applied to circuits
in which the material of the circuit remain the same. When the material
of the circuit is changing, we must return to the basic laws. The correct
physics is always given by the two basic laws

~F = e( ~E + ~v × ~B)

∇ × ~E = −

∂ ~B
∂t

(1)

(2)

2.1 A deﬁnition of emf

In order to try shedding some more light on the subject, let us begin with the
acknowledgement that the expression of Lorentz force

~F = q( ~E + ~v × ~B)

(3)

not only gives meaning to the ﬁelds solutions of Maxwell equations when applied to
point charges, but yields new predictions.5

The velocity appearing in the expression of Lorentz force is the velocity of the
charge: from now on, we shall use the symbol ~vcharge for distinguishing the charge
velocity from the velocity ~vline of the circuit element that contains the charge. This
is a basic point of the present treatment.

Let us consider the integral of ( ~E + ~vcharge × ~B) over a closed loop:

E = Il

( ~E + ~vcharge × ~B) · ~dl = Il

~E · ~dl +Il

(~vcharge × ~B) · ~dl

(4)

This integral yields the work done by the electromagnetic ﬁeld on a unit positive
point charge along the closed path considered.
It presents itself as the natural
deﬁnition of the electromotive force, within the Maxwell - Lorentz theory: emf = E.
Let us now calculate the value of E given by equation (4). The calculation of the

ﬁrst integral appearing in the third member of equation (4) yields:

Il

~E · ~dl = ZS

rot ~E · ˆn dS = −ZS

∂ ~B
∂t

· ˆn dS

(5)

4 Ibidem, p. 17 - 3.
5 The fact that the expression of Lorentz force can be derived by considering an inertial frame in
which the charge is at rest and by assuming that the force acting on it is simply given by ~F ′ = q ~E ′,
does not change the matter.

where S is any surface having the line l as contour and where we have made use of
Maxwell equation (2). The calculation of the last integral of equation (5) yields:

~E · ~dl = −

Il

d

dt ZS

~B · ˆn dS −Il

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl

(6)

where ~vline is the velocity of the circuit element ~dl.6 Notice that equation (6) is the
result of a theorem of vectorial calculus that is valid for any vector ﬁeld ~G, like the
magnetic ﬁeld, for which div ~G = 0. Therefore, we get:

E = "−

d

dt ZS

~B · ˆn dS −Il

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl# +Il

(~vcharge × ~B) · ~dl

(7)

This equation says that:

1. The induced emf is, in general, given by three terms.

mathematical and physical origin - come from the line integral Hl

2. The ﬁrst two - grouped under square brackets for underlining their common
~E · ~dl, whose
value is controlled by Maxwell equation (2) through equation (5). Accordingly,
their sum must be zero when the magnetic ﬁeld does not depend on time. In
this case, the law assumes the simple form:

E = Il

(~vcharge × ~B) · ~dl

(8)

3. The third term comes from the magnetic component of Lorentz force; we shall

see later how this term may be diﬀerent from zero.

4. The ﬂux rule is contained in the general law as a particular case.

The general law (7) can be written also in terms of the vector potential ~A. If we
put

Il

~E · ~dl = −Il

∂ ~A
∂t

· ~dl = −ZS

rot

· ˆn dS = 0

~E = −grad ϕ −

in the ﬁrst integral of the third member of equation (4), we get at once

E = −Il

∂ ~A
∂t

· ~dl +Il

(~vcharge × ~B) · ~dl

since Hl grad ϕ · ~dl = 0. When the magnetic ﬁeld does not depend on time (∂ ~B/∂t =

0), we have:

(9)

(10)

since rot (∂ ~A/∂t) = 0, because ∂ ~B/∂t = 0. Therefore, the only surviving term in the
expression of the induced emf is coming from the magnetic component of Lorentz
force and the law assumes the form given by equation (8).

2.2

~A versus ~B

Traditionally, textbooks use equations containing the magnetic ﬁeld in dealing with
induction phenomena: the emf in a loop is partially (general law) or totally (ﬂux
rule) dependent on a surface integral of ~B. The laws are predictive, but they are
not causal laws. The values of ~B over the surface of integration cannot be causally
related to the value of the emf around the circuit because ~B acts at a distance
(with an inﬁnite propagation velocity): in this case, ~B is not a good ﬁeld, since a
good ﬁeld, in Feynman’s words, can be deﬁned as

. . . a set of numbers we specify in such a way that what happens at a
point depends only on the numbers at that point. We do not need to
know any more about what’s going on at other places.7

On the contrary, the same equations written in terms of the vector potential, are
causal laws since they relate the value of the emf around the circuit to the values of
−∂ ~A/∂t at the points of the loop: the vector potential is, in this case, a good ﬁeld.

3 How the law works

3.1 General features

Let us come back to the general law (7 or 10). The charge velocity appearing in
these equations contributes to build up, through the factor ~vcharge × ~B the induced
electromotive ﬁeld. The charge velocity is given by:

~vcharge = ~vline + ~vdrif t

(12)

where ~vdrif t is the drift velocity.

Therefore, the general equation for electromagnetic induction assumes the form:

d

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl# +
(~vdrif t × ~B) · ~dl

(13)

7 R. Feynman, R. Leighton and M. Sands The Feynman Lectures on Physics, vol. II, (Addison
Wesley, Reading, Ma., 1964), p. 15 - 7. Feynman, uses the term ‘real ﬁeld’ instead of ‘good ﬁeld’.
Feynman deals with this problem in discussing the Bohm - Aharanov eﬀect. It is interesting to see
that an identical situation arises in classical electromagnetism.

E = "−
+ Il

dt ZS
~B · ˆn dS −Il
(~vline × ~B) · ~dl +Il

5

or, in terms of the vector potential:

E = −Il

∂ ~A
∂t

· ~dl +Il

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl +Il

(~vdrif t × ~B) · ~dl

(14)

When the circuit is made by a loop of wire, equation (13) reduces to equation

E = "−

d

dt ZS

~B · ˆn dS −Il

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl# +Il

(~vcharge/line × ~B) · ~dl

(15)

and equation (14) to equation

E = −Il

∂ ~A
∂t

· ~dl +Il

(~vcharge/line × ~B) · ~dl

(16)

because the drift velocity is always parallel to the line element ~dl and, consequently,
the integral containing it is zero. We have introduced the new notation vcharge/line for
remembering that we are dealing with the velocity of the charge that, in this case,
can be replaced by the velocity of the circuit element that contains it. It is worth
stressing again that, when the magnetic ﬁeld does not depend on time, equation
(15) cannot be read in terms of ﬂux variation, since the sum of the ﬁrst two terms
under square brackets is zero as it is the equivalent term of equation (16) containing
the time derivative of the vector potential.

When part of the circuit is made by extended material, the calculation of the drift
velocity contribution to the induced emf is not an easy task, since the distribution
of current lines in the material may be very complicated.8 In section 3.2.6 and 3.2.7
we shall treat particularly simple cases with a circular symmetry. In all other cases,
we shall neglect the drift velocity in the calculation of the induced emf (look at the
end of section 3.2.6 for a further discussion of this point).

3.2 How it works in speciﬁc cases

We shall now discuss some cases widely treated in literature, in order to see how the
general law (and the ﬂux rule) can be applied to speciﬁc problems.

8 The distribution of currents in extended materials have been studied since the mid of eigh-
teenth century. The following references are those that I know: E. Jochmann, “On the electric
currents induced by a magnet in a rotating conductor”, Phil. Mag., 27, (1864), 506 - 528; Phil.
Mag., 28, (1864), 347 - 349; H. Hertz, ‘On induction in rotating spheres’, in Miscellaneous papers,
(J.A. Barth, Leipzig) 1895, pp. 35 - 126. A discussion of some aspects of Hertz’s work can be
found in: Jed Z. Buchwald, The creation of scientiﬁc eﬀects - Heinrich Hertz and electric waves,
(The University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London) 1994, pp. 95 - 103; the papers by Boltz-
mann and Corbino quoted in footnotes 12; 13. V. Volterra, “Sulle correnti elettriche in una lamina
metallica sotto l’azione di un campo magnetico”, Il Nuovo Cimento, 9, 23 - 79 (1915). One should
also see the literature on eddy currents.

3.2.1 When a bar is moving

Figure 1:
the conducting bar A, of length a, moves with constant velocity ~v in a
uniform and constant magnetic ﬁeld ~B perpendicular to and entering the page. The
bar A slides on the conducting frame T . A steady current i circulates in the circuit
T 21.

Let us consider the circuit of ﬁg. 1. The conducting bar A, of length a, slides
with constant velocity ~v over the conducting frame T in a uniform and constant
magnetic ﬁeld ~B perpendicular to the plane of the frame and entering the page:
the frame T is at rest with respect to the source of the magnetic ﬁeld. A steady
current ﬂows along the direction indicated in the ﬁgure. Notice that in this case
we can neglect without approximation the drift velocity of the charge because it is
always directed along the integration line (owing to the Hall eﬀect). According to
the general law (16), the ﬁrst integral is zero as zero is sum of the ﬁrst two terms
of equation (15): as a matter of fact, if we choose the counterclockwise direction for
the line integral, we obtain for the sum of these two terms:

The induced electromotive force is then given by:

Bavline − Bavline = 0

E = Bavcharge/line

(17)

(18)

The surviving term is the one coming from the magnetic component of Lorentz force.
Moreover, the theory predicts that the emf is localized into the bar: the bar acts
as a battery and, as a consequence, between the two points 1 and 2 of the frame
that are in contact with the bar, one should measure a potential diﬀerence given by
V1 − V2 = E − ir, where i is the circulating current and r is the resistance of the bar.
Finally, it is worth stressing that the energy balance shows that the magnetic
component of Lorentz force plays the role of an intermediary: the electrical energy
dissipated in the circuit comes from the work done by the force that must be applied
to keep the bar moving with constant velocity.

Let us now recall how the ﬂux rule deals with this case. It predicts an emf given
by Bavline. In the light of the general law (15) and of its discussion, we understand
why the ﬂux rule predicts correctly the value of the emf: the reason lies in the fact
that the two line integrals under square brackets cancel each other. However, we
have shown above that the physics embedded in the general equation (15) forbids
to read equation (18) as the result of:

E = Bavline + [−Bavline + Bavline] = Bavline

(19)

that leaves operative the ﬁrst term coming from the ﬂux variation.

Before leaving this subject, it is worth saying something about the long debate
about the meaning of ‘localized emf ’. With reference to the moving bar, we can
proceed as follows. The points 1 and 2 divide the circuit into two parts: the one
on the left obeys Ohm law ∆V = iR and the current enters it at point 1 at higher
potential and leaves it at point 2 at lower potential; the part on the right does not
obeys Ohm law and the current enters it at point 2 at lower potential and leaves it
at point 1 at higher potential. We say that the emf is localized in the right part of
the circuit: it can be experimentally distinguished from the other.

3.2.2 The Faraday disc: 1

A conducting disc is rotating with constant angular velocity ω in a uniform and
constant magnetic ﬁeld ~B perpendicular to the disc and entering the page (ﬁg. 2).
A conducting frame DABC makes conducting contacts with the center and a point
on the periphery of the disc. A steady current i circulates as indicated by the arrow.
By applying the general laws (16) or (15) to the integration line at rest ABCDA,

we see that, if we neglect the contribution of the drift velocity:

• since the magnetic ﬁeld does not depend on time, the ﬁrst integral in (16) is

zero

• equivalently, the sum of the ﬁrst two integrals in (15) is zero. In the present
case, each of the two terms is zero: the ﬂux associated with the circuit does
not change and ~vline is zero everywhere, since the integration line has been
chosen at rest

• the only surviving term is the one due to the magnetic component of Lorentz
force and its value is given by (we are taking the counterclockwise direction
for the line integration):

E =

ωBR2

(20)

2

where R is the disc radius. In doing this calculation, we have neglected - as
explained at the end of section 3.1, the charge drift velocity (we shall take it
into account in section 3.2.7).

Figure 2:
the Faraday disc. A conducting disc rotates with constant angular
velocity ω in a uniform and constant magnetic ﬁeld ~B perpendicular to and entering
the plane of the disc. A conducting frame DABC makes conducting contacts with
the center and a point on the periphery of the disc. A steady current i circulates as
indicated by the arrow.

Of course, the emf given by equation (20) is induced along any radius, as it can be
seen by considering the circuit ABCC ′DA. If the radius C ′D is considered at rest,
the case is the same as that of the circuit ABCDA discussed just before. If the
radius C ′D is considered in motion with angular velocity ω, we see again, both from
equation (16) and equation (15), that the only surviving term is the one due to the
magnetic component of Lorentz force with the only diﬀerence that, now, the ﬁrst
term of equation (15) (1/2)ωBR2 is cancelled out by the second −(1/2)ωBR2, due
to the movement of the line elements of the radius DC ′; the line elements lying on
the CC ′ arc give a null contribution.

Let us now see how the ﬂux rule deals with the Faraday disc. If we choose the
lines at rest ABCDA or ABCC ′DA, we ﬁnd that the induced emf is zero; if we
choose the integration line ABCC ′DA, with the radius C ′D considered in motion,
we obtain the correct result E = (1/2)ωBR2.

As in the case of the moving bar, the ﬂux rule gets the correct result only because
the two line integrals under square brackets in equation (15) cancel each other.
As in the case of the moving bar, the physics embedded in the general equation
forbids an interpretation of the mathematical result in terms of ﬂux variation: again
the physical origin of the induced emf is due to the intermediacy of the magnetic
component of Lorentz force.

3.2.3 The unipolar induction

the unipolar induction. A conducting cylindrical magnet rotates about its
Figure 3:
axis in a counterclockwise direction. A conducting frame ABCD makes conducting
contacts between a point on the axis of the magnet and a point on its surface. A
steady current i circulates as indicated by the arrow.

The so called unipolar induction is illustrated in ﬁg. 3. When the cylindrical
and conducting magnet M rotates about its axis with angular velocity ω in the
counterclockwise direction, a current ﬂows in the circuit as indicated by the arrow.
It is easy to see that the discussion of the unipolar induction can be reduced to
that of the Faraday disc for both general law and ﬂux rule: the general law applied
to the circuit ABCDEA at rest yields an emf induced in the radius DE given by
(1/2)ωBDE
, while the ﬂux rule applied to the same circuit predicts a zero emf.
If one consider instead the integration line ABCDD′EA with the radius D′E in
motion, analogous to the path ABCC ′DA of ﬁg. 2 concerning the Faraday disc, one
can follow the same arguments developed in that case.

Figure 4: Kaempﬀer’s example. The circuit DEF GAC is closed by the conducting
magnet M that is moving to the right with constant velocity ~v. The magnet is
suﬃciently long in the direction perpendicular to the page so that there is a magnetic
ﬁeld only within the magnet. There is no induced emf in spite of the fact that there
is a ﬂux change through the circuit at rest ACDEF GA.

3.2.4 The ﬂux varies, but. . .

In ﬁg. 4 a case discussed by Scanlon, Henriksen and Allen9 and originally due to
Kaempﬀer10 is presented. When the conducting magnet M moves, as indicated,
with constant velocity ~v, there is no induced emf - if the magnet is suﬃciently long
in the direction perpendicular to the page so that there is a magnetic ﬁeld only
within the magnet. If we consider the integration line ACDEF GA at rest, there is
a ﬂux variation without induced emf . Also in this case, we must choose ad hoc the
integration line - for instance the line ACC ′D′DEF GA, where the segment C ′D′
moves with the magnet - if we want to save the ﬂux rule. On the other hand, the
general law works well, whatever integration line is chosen.

3.2.5 The ‘rocking plates’

This is one of the two ‘exceptions to the ﬂux rule’ discussed by Feynman, Leighton
and Sands (ﬁg. 5).11 The two plates oscillate slowly back and forth so that their

the ‘rocking plates’. Two conducting plates oscillate back and forth in a

point of contact moves from P to P ′ and viceversa. The circuit is closed by a wire
that connects point A and C. The magnetic ﬁeld ~B is perpendicular to the plates
and enters the page. The authors write:

If we imagine the “circuit” to be completed through the plates on the
dotted line shown in the ﬁgure, the magnetic ﬂux through this circuit
changes by a large amount as the plates are rocked back and forth. Yet
the rocking can be done with small motions, so that ~v × ~B is very small
and there is practically no emf.

According to the general law (15) the sum of the ﬁrst two terms of equation (15)
must be zero. Hence:

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl = −

Il

d

dt ZS

~B · ˆn dS

(21)

Therefore, the third term of equation (15) coming from the magnetic component of
Lorentz force equals the magnetic ﬂux variation changed in sign, if, of course, we
assume that the charge velocity can be taken equal to the velocity of the element of
conductor that contains it (the drift velocity is neglected). The conclusion is that
there is an induced emf :
its average value is given by −∆φ/∆t where ∆φ is the
ﬂux variation between the two extreme positions of the plates and ∆t the interval
of time taken in going from one position to the other: the induced emf gets smaller
and smaller as ∆t gets larger and larger; when the motion of the plates is very slow,
we can conclude with Feynman that ‘there is practically no emf ’. Notice that the
induced emf changes in sign (and the current its direction) when the the rocking
motion is reversed.

3.2.6 The Corbino disc

The discussion of this case will show how the charge drift velocity, always neglected
before, plays its role in the building up of the induced electromotive ﬁeld and, there-
fore, of the induced emf . In 1911, Corbino studied theoretically and experimentally
the case of a conducting disc with a hole at its center. If a voltage is applied between
the inner and the outer periphery of the disc, a radial current will ﬂow, provided
that the experimental setup is realized in a way suitable for maintaining the cir-
cular symmetry: the inner and outer periphery are covered by highly conducting
electrodes; therefore, the inner and outer periphery are two equipotential lines. If a
uniform and constant magnetic ﬁeld is applied perpendicularly to the disc, a circular
current will ﬂow in the disc.12

The ﬁrst theoretical treatment of this case is due, as far as I know, to Boltz-
mann who wrote down the equations of motion of charges in combined electric and
magnetic ﬁelds.13 Corbino, apparently not aware of this fact, obtained the same
equations already developed by Boltzmann. However, while Boltzmann focused on
magnetoresistance eﬀects, Corbino interpreted the theoretical results in terms of
radial and circular currents and studied experimentally the magnetic eﬀects due to
the latter ones.

The application of the general law of electromagnetic induction to this case leads
to the same results usually obtained (as Boltzmann and Corbino did) by writing
down and solving the equations of motion of the charges in an electromagnetic ﬁeld
(by taking into account, explicitly or implicitly, the scattering processes).

If Iradial is the radial current, the radial current density J(r) will be:

where s is the thickness of the disc, n the electron concentration and e the electron
charge. In the present case the general law of electromagnetic induction assumes
the simple form of equation (8) with vcharge = vdrif t; therefore, the induced emf
around a circle of radius r is given by:

Ecircular = I 2πr

(26)

where µ is the electron mobility, r1 and r2 the inner and outer radius of the disc (we
have used the relation µ = 1/ρne). Equation (26) is the same as that derived and
experimentally tested by Corbino.

The power dissipated in the disc is:

W = (I 2R)radial + (I 2R)circular = I 2

Equation (27) shows that the phenomenon may be described as due to an increased
resistance Rradial(1 + µ2B 2): this is the magnetoresistance eﬀect. The circular in-
duced emf is ‘distributed’ homogeneously along each circle. Each circular strip of
section s · dr acts as a battery that produces current in its own resistance: therefore,
the potential diﬀerence between two points arbitrarily chosen on a circle is zero.
Hence, as it must be, each circle is an equipotential line.

The above application of the general law yields a description of Corbino disc
that combine Boltzmann (magnetoresistance eﬀects) and Corbino (circular currents)
point of view and shows how the general law can be applied to phenomena tradition-
ally considered outside the phenomenological domain for which it has been derived.

3.2.7 The Faraday disc: 2

The discussion of Corbino disc helps us in better understanding the physics of the
Faraday disc. Let us consider a Faraday disc in which the circular symmetry is
conserved. This may be diﬃcult to realize; anyway, it is interesting to discuss it. As
shown above, the steady condition will be characterized by the ﬂow of a radial and
of a circular current. The mechanical power needed to keep the disc rotating with
constant angular velocity ω is equal to the work per unit time done by the magnetic
ﬁeld on the rotating radial currents. Then, it will be given by:

W = Z 2π

(30)

where the symbols are the same as those used in the previous section. The point is
that the term

E =

ω B (r2

(31)

is the induced emf due only to the motion of the disc. This emf is the primary
source of the induced currents, radial and circular. Therefore, the physics of the
Faraday disc with circular symmetry, may be summarized as follows:

a) the source of the induced currents is the induced emf due to the rotation of

the disc

b) the primary product of the induced emf is a radial current

c) the drift velocity of the radial current produces in turn a circular induced emf

that give rise to the circular current

4 General law and ﬂux rule

The cases discussed above must be considered as illustrative examples. Obviously,
the conceptual foundations of the general law and of the ﬂux rule can be discussed
without any reference to particular cases. The general law has been already dealt
with in great detail. Let us now focus our attention on the ﬂux rule.

Let us deﬁne - this, of course, is not our choice - the induced emf as

E = Il

~E · ~dl

(32)

where ~E obeys Maxwell equations. As shown above (equations 5 - 6), this leads
immediately to the conclusion that the induced emf is given by:

E = Il

~E · ~dl = −

d

dt ZS

~B · ˆn dS −Il

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl

(33)

15

or, in terms of the vector potential, by (equations 10 - 11):

E = Il
and is always zero when ∂ ~B/∂t = 0.

~E · ~dl = −Il

∂ ~A
∂t

· ~dl

(34)

Of course, this result is not satisfactory, if we want to save the ﬂux rule. There-

fore, one may suggest to deﬁne the induced emf as:

E = Il

~E · ~dl +Il

(~vline × ~B) · ~dl = −

d

dt ZS

~B · ˆn dS

(35)

thus reestablishing the ﬂux rule. This is, for instance, the choice made by Scanlon,
Henriksen and Allen.14 However:

• since the velocity appearing in equation (35) is clearly the velocity of the line

element ~dl, this deﬁnition has no physical meaning.

• the deﬁnition is ad hoc. As a consequence, as in the paper by Scanlon, Hen-
riksen and Allen, the line of integration must be chosen ad hoc for obtaining
predictions in accordance with the experimental ﬁndings.

5 Conclusions

The straightforward application of two fundamental laws of electromagnetism –
Maxwell equation rot ~E = −∂ ~B/∂t and Lorentz law ~F = q( ~E + ~v × ~B) – leads to
a general law for electromagnetic induction phenomena: it includes, as a particular
case, the standard ﬂux rule. The treatment given in this paper shows that standard
derivations:

a) Fail to recognize that the velocity involved in the integration of Maxwell equa-
tion (2) is the velocity of the line elements composing the closed path of
integration and not the velocity of the charges.

b) Overlook the fact that the expression of Lorentz force constitutes a fundamen-
tal postulate not included in Maxwell equations; this postulate not only gives
physical meaning to the ﬁelds solutions of Maxwell equations – when applied
to charges – but allows also the prediction of new phenomena.

c) In relevant cases, when a part of the circuit is moving, they are misleading as
far as the physical origin of the phenomenon is concerned: they attribute the
eﬀect to a ﬂux variation when, instead, the origin lies in the intermediacy of
the magnetic component of Lorentz force.

Finally, the present derivation:

• provides with a rigorous mathematical treatment the statement according to
which electromagnetic induction phenomena are the product of two indepen-
dent processes: time variation of magnetic ﬁeld and eﬀects of magnetic ﬁeld
on moving charges.

• yields a law that can be successfully applied to phenomena - those presented
by Corbino disc - till now considered outside the phenomenological domain of
electromagnetic induction.

Abstract

The Maxwell equations are formulated in a generally covariant and metric-free way in 1+3
and subsequently in 4 dimensions. For this purpose, we use the excitations
and the ﬁeld
strengths E, B. A local and linear constitutive law between excitations and ﬁeld strengths is
assumed, with a constitutive tensor χijkl =
χijlk of 36 components. The properties
of this tensor are discussed.
In particular, we address the validity of the Post constraint,
a subject that is very much under discussion. In this connection, the Tellegen gyrator, the
axion ﬁeld, and the “perfect electromagnetic conductor” of Lindell & Sihvola are compared
with each other.

homogeneous equations are the electric charge density ρ and the electric current density j. These
equations are expressed in a generally covariant form, that is, they are valid in arbitrary curvilinear
coordinates. Moreover, they are metric-free and thus the concept of orthogonality is not used at
all.

As shown in the literature, see [40, 34, 5], the Maxwell equations can alternatively be written

in terms of components as

the general covariance and the condition of being free of the metric are manifest. Note, since no
metric is used, we must not raise and lower indices with the help of the metric at this stage.

The Maxwell equations need to be supplemented by constitutive relations. And this for the
description (i) of empty spacetime (the vacuum) and (ii) of material media. We will discuss here
the simplest case, namely local and linear media. Local in space as well as in time, that is, the
excitations at every point in space and time depend only on the ﬁeld strength at the very same
point.

A general local and linear constitutive relation reads (in the conventions of [5]),

magnetic-electric cross eﬀects (like the Faraday eﬀect or optical activity). Altogether, these matri-

engineering community, see Lakhtakia & Weiglhofer [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 50, 51] and Lindell, Sihvola,
Tretyakov, et al. [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 38, 43, 49] whether this constraint is valid or not. We will
address this question.

The constitutive matrices are functions of space xa and time t in general. In other words, they
are ﬁelds Aba = Aba(xa, t), etc. For applications to the case (i), to empty spacetime, they can be
constants if a ﬂat Minkowski spacetime and Cartesian coordinates are prescribed. However, if a
Riemannian spacetime of general relativity is assumed or just a 4-dimensional diﬀerential mani-
fold, then clearly the constitutive matrices are ﬁelds. Similarly, in case (ii), for material media,
a homogeneous medium requires constant constitutive matrices, as soon as inhomogeneous media
are allowed, the constitutive matrices are ﬁelds again. We may call them generalized permittiv-
ity/impermeability ﬁelds.

Before we turn to a 4-dimensional discussion of the Maxwell equations, we want to comment on
the constitutive relations (5),(6). In the next section we will show that for reasons of 4-dimensional

2 Electrodynamics in 4-dimensional spacetime

The true structure of classical electrodynamics can be more clearly recognized if we present it in a
4-dimensional way. If we deﬁne excitation, electric current, and ﬁeld strength according to

H =
F = B + E

D − H ∧
∧

dt ,
dt ,

J = ρ

j

dt ,

−

∧

then the 4-dimensional Maxwell equations (1) and (2) read

d H = J ,
d F = 0 .

This shows explicitly that they are invariant under 4-dimensional coordinate/frame transformations
and independent of the metric of spacetime, see [5]. If we require metric independence, we get a
well-prescribed way of formulating the Maxwell equations. Since the metric of spacetime is the
gravitational potential in general relativity, it is gratifying to know that there is a gravity-free way
of formulating the Maxwell equations. Accordingly, the Maxwell equations (12),(13) are valid in a
ﬂat Minkowski spacetime (in any coordinates), in a curved Riemannian spacetime, and even in the
Riemann-Cartan spacetime of the Poincar´e gauge theory of gravitation. Needless to say that this
beautiful formalism has great practical value for applying electrodynamics in accelerated reference
frames, for instance.

The excitation H is a twisted 2-form, the ﬁeld strength F an untwisted 2-form, see the discussion

It can characterize (i) either empty
spacetime or (ii) a material medium. It has at most 36 independent components. In general, it is
a ﬁeld, that is, it can describe an inhomogeneous spacetime or an inhomogeneous medium.
The relativistic invariance properties are crucial for deciding between the EB- and E

-formal-
isms. From the point of view of a 4-dimensional spacetime, E and B form the invariant ﬁeld
form the invariant excitation H. Accordingly, the linear constitutive
strength F ; likewise,
law (5),(6) is a relativistically invariant statement, as it is seen from (16). This law involves the
constitutive matrices A, B, C, and D that are combined into a covariant object – the constitutive
tensor κij
do not form any 4-dimensional relativistic
objects, and, as a result, the constitutive relation in the form of (8), (9) involves non-covariant
objects with unclear physical meaning. Therefore, the EB-scheme of (5),(6) is, from a relativistic
point of view, to be preferred against the E
-scheme of (8),(9), see O’Dell [31], Chap.2, Sec.1.2,
pp.23–24. If det B
= 0, both systems are formally equivalent; still, (8),(9), as a historical artifact,
should be phased out from use.

One can decompose the constitutive tensor κij

kl into its irreducible pieces under the linear group
acting in the tangent and the cotangent space, respectively. Contraction is the only tool for such
a decomposition. Following Post [35], we can deﬁne the contracted twisted tensor of type [1

with 16 independent components. The second contraction yields the twisted scalar function

(also called pseudo- or axial-scalar). The traceless piece

It has been shown recently [17] that taking the linear spacetime relation for granted, one can derive
a Riemannian light cone provided one forbids birefringence in vacuum. However, if one allows for
the skewon ﬁeld, then the light cone is dissolved and we ﬁnd birefringence and more general type
of optical eﬀects [30].

Let us now turn to some examples for case (i), the vacuum.

Axion electrodynamics

If we admit additionally the axion ﬁeld α
axion (Maxwell-Lorentz) electrodynamics, see Ni [25, 26, 27] and Wilczek [52], e.g.:

= 0, then H = λ0

⋆F + αF . This framework is called

λ0 d ⋆F + (dα)

F = J ,

dF = 0 .

∧

It is as if the current J picked up an additional piece depending on the gradient of the axion ﬁeld.
The real part of Kiehn’s chiral vacuum [9] is a subcase, for α = const, of axion electrodynamics.

Pure axion ﬁeld and the gyrator

As a degenerate special case, we can also consider the pure (“stand-alone”) axion ﬁeld with (1)κij

This is a special case of axion electrodynamics, namely (27) with λ0 = 0. Here we have a case
in which the constitutive matrix B in (5) vanishes. Consequently, det B = 0 and the E
-version
(8),(9) of the constitutive law loses its meaning.

H

Seemingly the ﬁrst person to discuss (and to reject) a constant pure axion ﬁeld was Schr¨odinger
[41], p.25, penultimate paragraph, and, as a non-constant ﬁeld, Dicke [3]. The framework (30),(31)
corresponds to Tellegen’s gyrator [46, 47] and to Lindell & Sihvola’s perfect electromagnetic con-
ductor (PEMC) [20, 21].

Lindell & Sihvola deﬁne their PEMC by using directly the relation H = αF . Tellegen [46, 47]

considered a linear network of two terminal pairs (four-pole or two-port):

v1 = a11 i1 + a12 i2 ,
v2 = a21 i1 + a22 i2 .

The v’s represent voltages, the i’s currents, and the (frequency dependent) a’s resistances. Since
the ﬁeld strengths are related to the voltage (E SI

i.e., the excitations are rotated into the ﬁeld strengths. As a comparison with (30) shows, this
corresponds to the axion ﬁeld. Lindell & Sihvola [20] have shown that by using the E
-formalism
and by performing a suitable limiting transition (since det B = 0), one can also arrive at (38),(39).
Consequently, it is established that the medium analogue of Tellegen’s gyrator is the axion ﬁeld —
and both are equivalent to the PEMC of Lindell & Sihvola.

3 The constitutive tensor χijkl and its properties

We can raise the two lower indices of the constitutive tensor κij
Levi–Civita symbol ǫijmn. Thus, we can introduce the constitutive tensor density of spacetime,

kl with the help of the contravariant

kl but more widely in use. The notation χ was chosen in order to conform
which is equivalent to κij
with Post’s convention [34]. The constitutive law can now be written in the conventional form as

χijkl :=

see Post [34], eq.(6.12). The constitutive tensor with all 36 components has also been discussed in
an equivalent way by Lindell in his book [19], see also [42, 11, 43, 38, 23, 24, 20, 21].

We can decompose χijkl irreducibly under the linear group, too. With the expressions

Clearly, the principal part with its 20 independent components is the one discussed by Post [34].
The skewon part with its 15 components vanishes if one assumes the existence of a Lagrangian 4-
form from which the spacetime relation can be derived in full, see below. However, this assumption
is not a necessary, as we have shown [5]. Finally, the axion piece with only 1 independent component
is totally antisymmetric:

(3)χijkl = α ǫijkl .

In Post’s book [34], eq.(6.18), this piece is forbidden; therefore, Lakhtakia and Weiglhofer [14] called
it the Post constraint:

(3)χijkl = 0

or

α = 0

(Post constraint) .

2We want to underline that the irreducible decomposition of χijkl is algebraically similar the decomposition of a
curvature tensor in a Riemann-Cartan space (Riemannian space with a metric compatible connection). Of course,
only in a Riemann-Cartan space the curvature tensor has 36 independent components and can carry a totally
antisymmetric piece R[ijkl]. This piece, by the ﬁrst Bianchi identity, is directly related to Cartan’s torsion. But
let us stress, these are just algebraic analogies, not more and not less. Premetric electrodynamics, as represented
by eqs.(1) and (2), does neither couple to the metric nor to the connection of spacetime. Thus also torsion is not
involved. Moreover, the spacetime relation eventually deﬁnes a metric, but that’s all.

Post even carries on and requires ∂iα = 0, see his eq.(6.19). The reasons he gave for the latter
constraint are incomprehensible to us. Therefore, we will not dwell on it any further.

We want now to turn to criteria that will help us to decide which pieces of the constitutive tensor
are reasonable from a physical point of view. Our kinematical analysis so far gave no convincing
argument why any of its 36 components should not exist in nature. In the sequel, we will distinguish
between case (i), the vacuum, and case (ii), material media.

In electrodynamics, after formulating the Maxwell equations, one has to specify the energy-
momentum density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Also this can be done in a metric-free environment,
see [5]. The energy-momentum 3-form in (holonomic) coordinates reads

The representation (49) is most convenient for showing that the axion piece, even as ﬁeld, doesn’t
carry electromagnetic energy-momentum. The constitutive law H = α(x)F yields F
H =
F . Together with the second piece in (49), this vanishes. For the principal
F
piece it can be shown that it leads to positive energy, see [8], also the skewon piece has non-vanishing
contributions in general, see Table 1. We are talking here about the electromagnetic energy. If the

This brings us to the Lagrangian of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The Maxwell equations (12),(13)

current (49) via the Lorentz force density. A Lagrangian is not needed in this procedure. The
same it true for the local and linear constitutive law (in the sense of irreversible thermodynamics).

By substituting H = κ(F ) into the Lagrangian, the piece (2)κ(F ) drops out because of the “anti-
Onsager” symmetry (46)2. This shows that a possible skewon piece is related to dissipative eﬀects.
For material media this is certainly a possibility. For empty spacetime it may be a legitimate
hypothesis.

We will now turn to the propagation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (of “light”). In the geometrical

optics limit, we ﬁnd for the wave covector q the Fresnel equation [29, 5]

By simple algebra it is possible to prove that χ[ijkl] drops out from the Tamm-Rubilar tensor:
ijkl((3)χ) = 0. In other words, the
G
axion part (3)χijkl = ǫijklα(x), in the geometrical optics limit, does not inﬂuence the propagation of
ijkl((2)χ) = 0. But even more far-reaching, by straightforward
light. For the skewon piece we ﬁnd
ijkl((2)χ + (3)χ) = 0. Consequently, for (1)χ = 0, the
algebra, see [5], it can be shown that
Fresnel equation collapses and there is no orderly wave propagation in the geometrical optics limit.
Therefore, the existence of conventional wave propagation requires (1)χ
= 0, that is, the principal
part of the constitutive tensor must be non-vanishing.

Although from Table 1 one may have an impression that the axion ﬁeld is to a great extent
irrelevant in experiments, it does aﬀect physical observations. In particular, the important phe-
nomenon of electromagnetic waves is certainly not exhausted by geometrical optics. Speciﬁcally,
in the framework of axion electrodynamics (27) with a constant principal part (1)χijkl, Itin [7] (see
also Carroll et al. [2]) has shown that the axion ﬁeld does inﬂuence electromagnetic waves if one
looks into exact solutions. Assuming the usual plane wave ansatz for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
strength F = f eiϕ, with the constant amplitude 2-form f and the phase function ϕ(xi), we ﬁnd a
generalization of the Fresnel equation (52) in the form of [7]

ijkl(χ) qiqjqkql −

G

χijkl(∂iα)(∂lα) qjqk = 0 .

Here qi = ∂iϕ is the wave covector, as usual. This extended Fresnel equation is no longer an
homogeneous algebraic equation, and the axion ﬁeld contributes explicitly to the second term.
This necessarily leads, in the presence of the axion ﬁeld, to the birefringence of the waves.

As another manifestation of the axion ﬁeld, let us consider the Lorentz force density fi and the

balance equation related to it (see [5], Sec. B5.1):

fi = dΣi + Xi , with Xi :=

This is the force density that an electromagnetic ﬁeld exerts on charges and currents. The axion
ﬁeld indeed drops out from the ﬁrst term, which contains the electromagnetic energy-momentum

We will now come back to the constitutive relations (5),(6). We will again work with a 3–vector
formalism. Again, we formulate it in a metric independent way. We decompose the electromagnetic
ﬁeld with respect to the 3–dimensional coframe ϑa and the 2–form basis ˆǫb = ˆǫbcd ϑc

ϑd/2:

5 Constitutive tensor and physics

Up to here, we haven’t said much about which piece of the constitutive tensor may be realized in
nature. We just made a “kinematical” investigation of the most general local and linear constitutive
tensor with its 36 independent components. From an analysis of the Tamm-Rubilar tensor we
found that (1)χijkl
= 0 is necessary for a non-degenerate propagation of electromagnetic waves in
the geometrical optics limit. Only then the Tamm-Rubilar tensor doesn’t vanish and the Fresnel
equation exists. By the same method we ﬁnd that, in the same limit, (3)χijkl
= 0 doesn’t disturb
the wave propagation at all.

The skewon part (2)χijkl, in its full generality, was discussed, amongst others, by Sihvola &
Lindell [43, 19] and by us [5]. We studied already the possible eﬀects of the skewon ﬁeld on light
propagation [30]. But we should mention Nieves and Pal [28] who introduced, besides the vacuum
impedance 1/λ0 and the velocity of light c, a third constant for the vacuum by means of a specially
chosen skewon piece. Nieves and Pal assume (in our notation)

sa

b =

a , ma = 0 , na = 0
δb

(Nieves & Pal) .

(67)

This corresponds to a spatially isotropic skewon ﬁeld. By (67), a constraint is given that restricts the
class of allowed reference frames. Lakhtakia4 calls it “isotropic chirality which is Lorentz reciprocal”.
The Post constraint doesn’t forbid it since the Nieves & Pal piece relates to the skewon part, whereas
the violation of the Post constraint to the axion part. Lakhtakia points out that s
= 0 is valid for
certain materials, but not for vacuum. Furthermore, others (see [5]) put forward the hypothesis
that there can be a fourth electromagnetic constant that makes the medium “nonreciprocal (but
still isotropic)”. It is, of course, the axion ﬁeld. With (67), the constitutive law (65),(66) reads

where we used the notation (1)
H
of a Maxwell-Lorentzian principal piece in exterior calculus as

D

:= (1)κ(F ). We rewrite (68),(69) for the case

Note how the isotropic skewon ﬁeld and the axion ﬁeld act with diﬀerent signs on Ea and Ba.
Thereby they can be distinguished phenomenologically. We stress that the axion ﬁeld α is a
premetric, 4-dimensional scalar with twist and as such of fundamental potential importance. In
contrast, the skewon ﬁeld s is only a 3-dimensional scalar valid in a constrained class of reference
frames.—

What is then the the state of the Post constraint? Of course, the somewhat abstract concepts
of a pure axion ﬁeld, the Tellegen gyrator, and the PEMC of Lindell & Sihvola all violate the Post
constraint, that is, α
= 0, whereas the other pieces of the constitutive tensor vanish at the same
time.

One argument in favor of the Post constraint is the following (see [50]): With (1)H := (1)κ(F )

and (2)H := (2)κ(F ), the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation for the linear constitutive law reads

dH = d

(1)H + (2)H
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

+ (dα)

F = J ,

∧

(72)

where we used already the homogeneous Maxwell equation dF = 0, see also (27). If the axion piece
of the constitutive tensor is constant, i.e., dα = 0, then α cannot couple to the Maxwell equations.
However, this is only true for an inﬁnitely extended material. As soon as the material has ﬁnite
size, the axion piece α jumps at the surfaces of the material — and this jump of α couples to
the Maxwell equations. In other words, the axion ﬁeld can be seen along those jump surfaces by
means of electromagnetic waves beyond the geometrical optics limit. In order to make this explicit,
let us assume that a two-dimensional surface S divides the space into two parts. Let now both
half-spaces be ﬁlled with homogeneous material media both of which are characterized by constant
but unequal values of the axion ﬁeld: α1, say, in the ﬁrst material and α2 in the second one. Then,
if we take as an example the pure gyrator case with the constitutive law (30), we ﬁnd from the
jump conditions on the boundary (see [5], Sec. B.4.3),

jump of the axion ﬁeld on the boundary. Thus, even though the constant axion drops out from the
Maxwell equations inside both homogeneous regions, it pops up in the form of the surface charge
ja induced on the boundary S. Both are proportional
density
to the jump of the axion [α].
In the more general case of axion electrodynamics, see (27), the
a
left-hand sides in (73) will include the jump of the normal components of the electric excitation
and the jump of the tangential components of the magnetic excitation
argument can be generalized straightforwardly.

D
Ha, respectively. Hence our
This enables us to measure the value of the axion ﬁeld of a homogeneous material medium. In
this sense, the axion ﬁeld of a material medium, our case (ii), always couples to the inhomogeneous
Maxwell equation, and the argument mentioned above no longer applies. In the case of spacetime,
also a curved one, the argument is correct if really everywhere dα = 0. As soon as the axion ﬁeld
becomes space and/or time dependent, also in case (i) the quoted argument loses its meaning.

e

For empty spacetime, our case (i), the Post constraint, according to experimental evidence, is
fulﬁlled. However, the relaxation of the Post constraint leads to the concept of the axion ﬁeld.
According to our Table 1, this ﬁeld is very elusive since it neither shows up in the electromagnetic
energy-momentum tensor nor in the Tamm-Rubilar-tensor, i.e., it doesn’t inﬂuence light propaga-
tion in the limit of geometrical optics. Hence it is hard to detect it. A whole industry is at work to

ﬁnd the axion ﬁeld, see the new data on elementary particles [32], p. 389. So far without success.
There is no theoretical reason known to us that would forbid the axion ﬁeld. Quite the oppo-
site. From a theoretical point of view, it appears as a quite natural extension of Maxwell-Lorentz
electrodynamics. But, as mentioned, the axion hasn’t been found so far.

For material media, our case (ii), the situation is diﬀerent. Gyrators have been engineered,
see [6]. Consequently, there is little doubt that materials can be constructed that violate the
Post constraint. The Tellegen model with parallel or antiparallel electric and magnetic dipoles
looks reasonable, see Tretyakov et al. [49]. In the meantime, Tretyakov et al. [48] built an artiﬁcial
Tellegen particle and veriﬁed its nonreciprocal magnetoelectric behavior. “Natural” material media
exist that violate the Post constraint, namely Cr2O3 and in Fe2Te O6 in static magnetic ﬁelds, see
de Lange & Raab [18]. Accordingly, model calculations [33, 38] and experiments [18] (see also [37])
show that the Post constraint is valid for many materials; however, it is deﬁnitely violated in some
rare cases. Thus, the Post constraint as a general dogma should be buried with all due honors.

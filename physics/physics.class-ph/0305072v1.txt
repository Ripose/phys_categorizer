The analysis of the dynamical behavior of a system consisting of two isolated cavities, ﬁlled
with a gas and separated by a moving adiabatic wall, reveals that the entropy of such an isolated
system can undergo a signiﬁcant decrease. This notable result is extremely sensitive to the system
dimensions, any appreciable deviation from a mesoscopic scale of the order of one micron rendering
our conclusions invalid, so that no implications can be drawn from our results on the validity of the
second law of thermodynamics at a macroscopic level.

PACS numbers:

Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the
thermodynamics of small-scale nonequilibrium devices,
especially in connection with the operation and eﬃciency
of Brownian motors. [1] In particular, the status of the
second law and the possibility that its standard interpre-
tation may not be valid when dealing with mesoscopic
regimes, as those pertaining to the biological realm, has
been thoroughly discussed in the First International Con-
ference on the ”Quantum Limits to the Second Law” (San
Diego, 2002).[2] In this contest, we wish to describe an
elementary mesoscopic dynamical system which, under
speciﬁc conditions, can give rise to a violation of the sec-
ond law.

Our system consists of two isolated cavities A and B,
ﬁlled with a common number of moles of the same gas,
separated by a movable impermeable partition which is
assumed to be initially at rest in a position corresponding
to equal volumes and temperatures (and thus pressures)
in the two cavities. Under these conditions, one would
expect the wall to remain at rest, apart from microscopic
random oscillations around the equilibrium position.

This is obviously the case in most ordinary situations,
where the wall thermal conductivity is large enough to
maintain a common temperature in the two cavities, so
that any small random displacement of the wall is imme-
diately reversed by the induced pressure change. Con-
versely, if thermal conductivity is negligible, it will be
shown below that the wall can actually undergo size-
able random displacements, during which the pressures

tion, the system evolves and the total entropy variation,
from the initial state in which both cavities have the
same volume V0/2 and temperature T0, to a generic one

stant pressure and n the common number of gas moles
on each side. The ensemble average ∆S of this intrinsi-
cally negative entropy change can assume large values in
speciﬁc mesoscopic situations, as it will be proved in this
paper. Note that in deriving Eq.(1), we have exploited
the relation TA + TB = 2T0, which corresponds to ne-
glecting the kinetic energy of the wall.
In fact, under
the adiabatic hypothesis, it can be regarded as a body
possessing a single (translational) degree of freedom. As
a consequence, its energy and entropy are of the order
kT0/2 and k, respectively, and can be neglected.

In order to corroborate the above considerations, we
investigate the so-called adiabatic-piston problem, [3, 4]
dealing with a system which, in the language of classical
thermodynamics, consists of an isolated cylinder divided
into two parts by means of a frictionless adiabatic piston,
each section containing the same number n of moles of
the same perfect gas (see Fig.(1)). Initially, the piston
is held by latches in the ﬁxed position corresponding to
equal volumes and pressures in the two sections. Once
the latches are removed, the system evolves in a labile
quasi-equilibrium state, driven by the random motion
of the wall induced by the elastic molecular collisions,
while the gas pressure on both sides remains equal to the
initial one.
[4, 5] We describe the dynamics of the sys-
tem in terms of the random variable X(t), that is the

us ﬁrst consider the intrinsically deterministic situation
[4], in which the system evolves starting from diﬀerent
initial pressures in A and B. In this case, the governing
dynamical equation (Eq.(8) of [4]) reads

where R is the gas constant, M and Mg are, respectively,
the piston mass and the common value of the gas mass
in each side (corresponding to n moles), and T1(t), T2(t)
label the temperatures in sections A and B. The above
equation describes the situation in which the macroscopic
pressure diﬀerence in A and B dictates the deterministic
dynamical behavior of the piston. In particular, the ﬁrst
term on its RHS represents the force induced on the wall
by the pressure diﬀerence on the two sides, while the
other ones are associated with the ﬁnite velocity of the
piston. More precisely, the second term plays the role of
a viscous friction , while the third term corresponds to
a restoring force pointing toward the symmetry position
X = L/2. The structure of Eq.(2) implies the piston to
reach a ﬁnal rest position Xf characterized by a common

[4].

In this paper, we consider the system evolution from a
diﬀerent initial conﬁguration of macroscopic equilibrium,

2

that is equal pressures and temperatures on both sides
and piston at rest. In this case, Eq.(2) would obviously
imply the piston to remain at rest, i.e., X(t) = L/2 at
all times. Actually, the description provided by Eq.(2)
hinges upon neglecting any kind of driving stochastic
force, as compared to the large deterministic force as-
sociated with the ﬁnite pressure diﬀerence (ﬁrst term on
the RHS of Eq.(2)). In our situation (piston initially at
rest and no initial pressure diﬀerence), the pressures re-
main equal at all times. As a consequence, the stochastic
acceleration a(t) generated by the random molecular hits
on the piston is no longer negligible as it was when start-
ing from diﬀerent pressures, being now the only driving
force acting on the piston. Therefore, the deterministic
Eq.(2) is now superseded by the stochastic equation

The question naturally arises: what are the spatial and
temporal scales over which this violation of the second law
of thermodynamics can actually occur? Before answer-
ing this question, the conceptual meaning of the result
implied by Eq.(6) has to be clariﬁed. To this aim, we
note that, according to standard thermodynamics, any
closed system in an equilibrium state, once an internal
constraint is removed, eventually reaches a new equilib-
rium state characterized by a larger value of the entropy.
The case considered in this paper represents a remarkable
exception to this statement. More precisely, our closed
system is made up of the two gases and the initial in-
ternal constraint is provided by the piston held in the
central position. After the piston is released, our anal-
ysis shows that no ﬁnal equilibrium state is eventually
reached, since the piston keeps wandering, performing
random oscillations around X=L/2, with mean-square
amplitude

= (L/2)2µ/2.

We now return to the question of the spatial and tem-
poral scales over which our results apply. To this end,
let us consider the speciﬁc case of a gas under standard
conditions of temperature and pressure, for which, ex-

its main hypotheses, that is the complete molecular-chaos
assumption (Stosszahlansatz), is not valid in our dynam-
ics: in fact, the correlation induced by the random mo-
tion of the piston favors a common sign of vx and v′
x in
the two-particle correlation function of the gas near the
piston, while the single-particle correlation functions are
independent from the sign of vx and v′
x. This prevents the
two-particle correlation distribution to factorize into the
product of the one-particle distribution functions and,
thus, the molecular-chaos assumption does not apply.

Finally, the validity of our conclusions appears to be
corroborated by suitable molecular dynamic simulations
of the evolution of our system. These typically involve a
considerable number of point particles, which model the
gas inside the cylinder, separated by a frictionless piston
against which they undergo perfect elastic collisions. Ac-
tually, a preliminary attempt in this direction [11], with
a number of particles of the order of 103, indicates that
the diﬀerence between the temperatures on the two sides
undergoes relevant oscillations, so that the system does
not reach equilibrium, as predicted by our model.

to check a posteriori the hypothesis of thermalization of
the piston velocity over a short time scale.

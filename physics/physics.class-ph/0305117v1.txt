(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We report on a new test of Lorentz invariance performed by comparing the resonance frequencies of
two orthogonal cryogenic optical resonators subject to Earth’s rotation over ∼ 1 year. For a possible
anisotropy of the speed of light c, we obtain ∆θc/c0 = (2.6 ± 1.7) · 10−15. Within the Robertson-
2 = (−2.2±1.5)·10−9 ,
Mansouri-Sexl test theory, this implies an isotropy violation parameter β −δ− 1
about three times lower than the best previous result. Within the general extension of the standard
model of particle physics, we extract limits on 7 parameters at accuracies down to 10−15, improving
the best previous result by about two orders of magnitude.

Special relativity (SR) underlies all accepted theories
of nature at the fundamental level. Therefore, it has been
and must be tested with ever increasing precision to pro-
vide a ﬁrm basis for its future application. Such tests
are also motivated by the eﬀorts to unify gravity with
the other forces of nature, one of the outstanding open
In fact, many currently
challenges in modern science.
discussed models of quantum gravity do violate the prin-
ciples of SR. In string theory, for example, violation of
Lorentz invariance might be caused by spontaneous sym-
metry breaking [1]; in loop gravity, eﬀective low–energy
equations (e.g., modiﬁed Maxwell equations [2]) that vi-
olate Lorentz invariance have been derived. Since the
natural energy scale for quantum gravity is the Planck
scale, Ep ∼ 1019 GeV, a direct experimental investigation
of quantum gravity eﬀects is not feasible. It is, however,
possible to search for residual eﬀects at an attainable en-
ergy scale in experiments of outstanding precision. High-
precision bounds on Lorentz violation might give valuable
hints for or against particular models of quantum gravity.

A sensitive probe for Lorentz violation (in electrody-
namics) is the Michelson-Morley (MM) experiment [3],
that even predated the formulation of SR. It tests the
isotropy of the speed of light, one of SR’s foundations.
In the classic setup, one compares the speed of light c
in two orthogonal interferometer arms by observing the
interference fringes. If c depends on the direction of prop-
agation, the fringes move if the setup is rotated (using,
e.g., Earth’s rotation or a turntable). In 1979, Brillet and
Hall [4] introduced the modern technique of measuring a
laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of an optical ref-
erence cavity. The frequency of such a resonance is given
by νcav = mc/(2L), where L denotes the cavity length
and m = 1, 2, . . . the mode number. Thus, a violation of
the isotropy of c can be detected by rotating the cavity
and looking for a resulting variation of νcav by comparing
the frequency of the cavity–stabilized laser against a suit-
able reference. In our experiment (Fig. 1), we compare
the frequencies νx and νy of two similar cavities oriented

in orthogonal directions, in analogy with the classical in-
terferometer tests. Compared to the single–cavity setup,
this arrangement doubles the hypothetical signal ampli-
tude and provides some common–mode rejection of sys-
tematic eﬀects.

Our results are obtained making use of the high dimen-
sional stability of cryogenic optical resonators (COREs).
Constructed from crystalline sapphire, COREs show a
low thermal expansion coeﬃcient (10−10/K at 4.2 K)
and a remarkable absence of creep (i.e., intrinsic length
changes due to material relaxation); upper limits for
the CORE frequency drift are < 2 kHz/6 months and
< 0.1 Hz/h [5], which makes COREs particularly well
suited for high-precision measurements such as relativity
tests [6, 7]. For the MM experiment, it allows us to rely
solely on Earth’s rotation. This avoids the systematic
eﬀects associated with active rotation, which previous
experiments had to use to overcome the creep of room
temperature resonators made from glass ceramics, e.g.
ULE (ultra–low–expansion), on the time–scale of a day.

A suitable theoretical framework for analyzing tests
of Lorentz invariance is the general Standard Model
Extension (SME) [8, 9]. A Lagrangian formulation of
the standard model is extended by adding all possible
observer Lorentz scalars that can be formed from known

the Lagrangian is L = 1
4 (kF )κλµν F κλF µν
[10]. The tensor (kF )κλµν (the greek indices run from
0 . . . 3) has 19 independent components; they vanish, if
SR is valid. 10 of its components, that can be arranged
into traceless symmetric 3 × 3 matrices (˜κe+)AB and
(˜κo−)AB, describe polarization–dependent eﬀects. They
are restricted to < 2 · 10−32 by polarization measure-
ments on light from astronomical sources [9] and are
assumed to be zero in the following. The remaining
9 components describe boost invariance and isotropy
of c and can be arranged into traceless 3 × 3 matrices
(˜κe−)AB (symmetric) and (˜κo+)AB (antisymmetric) plus
one additional parameter. They lead to a shift δν of the

resonance frequency of a cavity [9] with a characteristic
time signature and can thus be measured in cavity
experiments.

For our experiment (Fig. 1), we use two L = 3 cm long
COREs that feature linewidths of 100 kHz and 50 kHz,
respectively, (Finesses ∼ 105), located inside a liquid he-
lium (LHe) cryostat with a liquid nitrogen (LN2) shield.
Reﬁlls and the evaporation of coolants cause mechanical
deformations of the cryostat, which change the resonator
position. An automatic beam positioning system actively
compensates for these movements (Fig. 1). The frequen-
cies νlas of two diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers at 1064 nm
are stabilized (“locked”) to resonances of the COREs us-
ing the Pound-Drever-Hall method. The Nd:YAG laser
crystal strain (generated by a piezo attached to the crys-
tal) and temperature were used for tuning the frequency.
The phase modulation at frequencies fm around 500 kHz
is also generated by crystal strain modulation using me-
chanical resonances of the piezo. The light reﬂected from
the COREs is detected inside the cryostat (Fig. 1) on
Epitaxx 2000 InGaAs detectors. Down–conversion to DC
at 3fm rather than 1fm reduces the inﬂuence of resid-
ual amplitude modulation and gives a higher signal-to-
noise (S/N) ratio for the same circulating laser power
inside the cavity. For the detector signal, ampliﬁers con-
sisting of 8 paralleled BF1009 dual-gate MOSFETs pro-
vide low current noise in spite of the high detector ca-
pacitance (500 pF). At ∼ 80 nW laser power impinging

on the COREs, we achieve an error signal S/N ratio of
∼ 1.5 ·104 ·
τ /s. Between 80 . . . 200 nW have been used,
minimizing the change of νcav due to laser heating of the
COREs (∼ 10 Hz/µW). The error signal is generated us-
ing mini-circuits ZHL-32 high-level ampliﬁers and SAY-1
23 dBm double-balanced-mixers operating at ∼ 0 dBm
RF amplitude and thus well below saturation. This pro-
vides highly linear operation and proved very important
for a low sensitivity to systematic disturbances. On a
time scale of minutes, we reach a minimum relative fre-
quency instability of the lasers locked to the COREs of
7 · 10−16, referred to a single CORE (Fig. 2). Such a
level is reached by the best ULE-cavity stabilized lasers
[11] only if a large linear drift ∼ 2 Hz/s is subtracted.

A number of systematic disturbances (e.g.

residual
amplitude modulation, parasitic etalons, or mixer oﬀset
voltages) that cause lock–point shifts are compensated
for using a new technique: By an additional phase mod-
ulation of the laser beams, a part of the laser power is
shifted into side–bands, thus reducing the amplitude of
the useful part of the error signal.
If the parasitic ef-
fects do not have suﬃcient frequency selectivity to dis-
criminate these sidebands against the carrier, modulat-
ing the amplitude of the sidebands makes the lock–point
shifts time–dependent, so they can be identiﬁed and com-
pensated for [12]. This proved instrumental in achieving
the reliable and repeatable laser system performance re-
quired for accumulating enough data.

Except for a 10 day break around New Year 2002,
the COREs were operated continuously at 4.2 K over
more than one year. Usable data (discounting data sets
shorter than 12 hours and data taken during adjustment
or LHe reﬁlls) starts June 19, 2001 and was acquired over
390 days until July 13, 2002. A total of 146 data sets
of 12 h to 109 h in length, totaling 3461 h, are available
(Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). 49 almost equally distributed data
sets are longer then 24 h. For extracting results, simul-

cated in a copper block to provide common-mode rejection
of thermal eﬀects. LN2 is reﬁlled automatically every ∼ 3 h,
LHe manually every ∼ 2 days. Laser beams are coupled to
the COREs via windows, with polarizers P and lock detectors
PD inside the cryostat. For active beam positioning, beams
pass through galvanomter (G) mounted glass plates. The hor-
izontal and vertical displacements are adjusted to maximize
coupling into the cavities, as measured using the 2fm signal
from the detector in reﬂection. Not shown is the setup for
measuring the frequency diﬀerence νx − νy of the lasers, in
which the beams are overlapped on a high–speed photode-
tector and the beat frequency is measured against a quartz
oscillator stabilized to the GPS.

performed. Before ﬁtting, the data sets are divided into
subsets of 12 h (or 24 h for the 24 h signals). This drops
a fraction of the data, but makes the resulting sinewave
amplitudes independent of oﬀsets in the data. We obtain
199 ﬁts of 12 h data subsets (Fig. 3).

Earth’s orbital velocity. All elements of ˜κo+ and all but
one element of ˜κe− are obtained. Compared to [16], we
improve the accuracy by about two orders of magnitude.
Moreover, while [16] give limits on linear combinations
of the elements of ˜κo+, the present experiment allows in-
dividual determination, because of the > 1 year span of
our data.

While all three experiments are required for a complete
veriﬁcation of SR within this framework, the MM exper-
iment currently oﬀers the highest resolution. In case of
a violation of isotropy, B 6= 0, for our experiment we
obtain a periodic change of the beat frequency νx − νy
at 2ω⊕ [20]. For such a signal, the experiment yields an
amplitude 1.03 ± 0.53 Hz, or B = (−3.1 ± 1.6) · 10−9. As
the quality of the data is not uniform (Fig. 3), taking
a weighted vector average is more appropriate here [15].
We divide the data into the intervals A-E (Fig.3) with
approximately uniform data quality within each. The
averages over the intervals are then combined to the ﬁ-
nal result, weighted according to their standard error.
This leads to a signal of 0.73 ± 0.48 Hz, or

which we regard as the ﬁnal result within the RMS
framework. It has an inaccuracy about three times lower
than the best previous result B = (3.0 ± 4.9) · 10−9[4, 21].

In summary, we performed a modern Michelson-
Morley experiment by comparing the frequencies of two
crossed cryogenic optical resonators subject to Earth’s
rotation over a period spanning more than one year.
Within the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl
framework, our
limit on the isotropy violation parameter is about three
times lower than that from the classic experiment of Bril-

magnitude lower than the only previous result [16].
While the high long–term stability of COREs allows one
to use solely Earth’s rotation, active rotation could still
improve the accuracy signiﬁcantly. Due to the low drift of
COREs compared to ULE cavities, the optimum rotation
rate would be relatively slow, which is desirable for mini-
mizing the systematics. At a rate of ∼ 0.2/min (∼ 5/min
was used in [4]), one could utilize the optimum ∼ 7·10−16
frequency stability (Fig. 2) of the COREs, more than 10
times better than on the 12 h time scale used so far. Since
∼ 500 measurements (2 per turn) could be accumulated
per day, one should thus be able to reach the 10−17 level
of accuracy. Further improvements include ﬁber coupling
and COREs of higher ﬁnesse. Finally, space based mis-
sions with resonators are currently studied (OPTIS [22]
and SUMO [23]).

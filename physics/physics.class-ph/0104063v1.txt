Abstract. The paper elucidates the physical basis of experimental results on superluminal
signal velocity. It will be made plausible that superluminal signals do not violate the principle
of causality but they can shorten the luminal vacuum time span between cause and eﬀect.
This amazing behaviour is based on the property that any physical signal has a ﬁnite duration.

Introduction

One of the ﬁrst investigations on wave propagation was presented by Lord Rayleigh
at the end of the 19th century. He considered that the group velocity corresponds to
the velocity of energy or signal. This however raised diﬃculties with the theory of
relativity in dispersive media. The problem was resolved by Sommerfeld and Brillouin
in the case of waves with real wave numbers, however, it was not tackled for signals
composed of evanescent modes only [1, 2]. For instance in a textbook on Relativity,
Groups, Particles published recently a chapter is devoted to signal velocities faster
than light
[3]. The authors conclude that superluminal group velocities may have
been measured, however, they state the initial packet gets completely deformed and
unsuitable for perfect signal transmission during the course of propagation due to the
vastly diﬀering phase velocities of its various frequency components. The authors claim
that a signal velocity never ever can exceed the vacuum velocity of light. Allegedly
this has been proven by Einstein studying the light propagation in vacuum a hundred
years ago in his famous paper [4].

In the case of tunnelling the above cited statement vastly diﬀerent phase velocity.....
is incorrect since an evanescent (tunnelling) mode has a purely imaginary wave number
and does not experience a phase change [5, 6, 7, 8]. Therefore the phase does not
depend on the ﬁeld spreading inside a barrier. This outstanding property of the
tunnelling process can indeed result in a superluminal signal velocity as will be reported
in this article [8, 9]. Other books and papers even deny absolutely the possibility of
either superluminal energy or signal velocities, see for instance references [10, 11, 12,
13]. Some authors claim that frequency-band limitation is of course a technical and
not a fundamental limitation [14]. Yes certainly, there is a ﬁnite probability for higher
frequency components, even if their energy ¯hω exceeds tremendously the signal’s total
energy [13]. However, these high frequency components having an extremely low

probability and short lifetime are not traceable at all and their statistical nature make
ﬂuctuations not suitable for signalling. Technical signals have usually a frequency
band width much less than 1 % of the carrier frequency thus dispersion eﬀects as
a result of an interaction between the electromagnetic wave and any potential don’t
necessarily cause signiﬁcant signal reshaping. For the extensive discussion and the
various deﬁnitions of a signal see e.g. Refs. [9, 15, 16, 17]. For example a digital signal
as displayed in Fig. 2a is deﬁned by the envelope which contains the total information.
The amplitude don’t carry information only the half width represents the number
of digits. Here the carrier frequency is 2×1014 Hz and the relative frequency band
modulation is 10−4. For lang distance signal transmission signals were modulated on
a high frequency carrier.

Figure 1 presents two measured superluminal signals. They are pulse-like shaped
as we are used to from digital communication systems. One pulse has travelled at a
negative group velocity of vg = -c/310 the other one has tunnelled a photonic barrier
at a speed of vg = 4.7 c, where c is the velocity of light in vacuum. The reader should
inspect the two superluminal signals whether they are completely deformed as claimed
in Ref. [3]. A deformation of the signals is not seen and both will be detected and
interpreted properly as a well deﬁned signal by the detector in question. In digital
signal transmission the half width of the pulse represents the information (see Fig. 1
right and Fig. 2(a)). The superluminal time shift of the signal’s envelope measured in
both experiments represents the information that a superluminal signal including its
energy have been measured. The signals shown in Fig. 1 have a frequency–band width
of 120 kHz at a carrier frequency of 350 THz and 300 MHz at a carrier frequency of
10 GHz, respectively.

Obviously superluminal signal velocities do exist. As an example of superluminal
signal transmission the tunnelling process is discussed here. Electromagnetic waves
with a purely imaginary wave number are called evanescent modes. They play an

important role in microwave technology and in classical optics. As a result of their
mathematical analogy with wave mechanical tunnelling the instantaneous process of
the spreading of evanescent ﬁelds is called photonic tunnelling [5, 6]. Three prominent
photonic barriers for studying the tunnelling process are presented in Fig. 3.

The article begins with a presentation of the special properties of a physical signal.
Amazingly enough in the following section it is shown that superluminal signal veloc-
ities can shorten the luminal time span between cause and eﬀect but do not violate
the principle of causality.

2 Signals

A signal is thought to cause a corresponding eﬀect. Basically phonons, photons, and
electrons are exploited to mediate interaction or to transmit bits, words or any desired
signal to induce requested eﬀects. The front or the discontinuous beginning of a signal
is only well deﬁned in the mathematical case of an inﬁnite frequency spectrum. Any
physical transmitter produces signals of ﬁnite spectra only. Therefore a front has
no physical meaning and the narrow–band and the wide–band envelope (deﬁned and
discussed in Ref. [1, 20]) is the appropriate signal description. An example is displayed
in Fig. 2a. In the case of an inﬁnite signal spectrum the Planck quantum ¯hω of the
minimum energy of a ﬁeld would necessarily result in an inﬁnite signal energy as
mentioned in the introduction.

A signal may be a single photon or electron with a distinct energy, more general
a signal is characterized by a carrier frequency and its modulation and it is bound to
be independent of magnitude otherwise we could not listen to the radio broadcasting
or mobile phone during driving a car. There are frequency (FM) and amplitude (AM)
modulated signals or a combination of both. A signal is not described by an analytical
function, otherwise the complete information would be contained in the forward tail of
a signal. In the latter case a detector could recognize from the forward tail the rest of
the shape of the signal [21]. This becomes obvious for instance in digital optoelectronic

communication systems, where measuring the signal half width gives the number of
digits. Such a digital signal sent via glass ﬁber in modern communication systems is
presented in Fig. 2(a).

In the same ﬁgure part 2(b) is a calculated sine wave signal of 10 oscillations plot-
ted. The dotted one has an unlimited frequency–band width, whereas the solid one
has a ﬁnite frequency–band. The carrier frequency is 5 GHz and the width 500 MHz.
As a result of the frequency–band limitation there are noncausal components. The
calculated result follows from the mathematical Fourier transform of a frequency band
limitation. The noncausal components are not measurable. Any physical signal is be-
ginning gradually at the time t = 0 as seen in Figs. 1, 2(a) [1, 9, 20]. A discontinuously
signal beginning would make necessary the existence of inﬁnite frequency components.
In the following we repeat the deﬁnitions of velocities which are found presented

extensively elsewhere, e.g. in Refs. [1, 6, 7, 20, 22]:

where ω and k are the angular frequency and the wave number, respectively. vϕ is the
phase, vg is the group, and vs is the signal velocity. Relation (3) of the signal velocity
vs is valid in vacuum or in other anomalous dispersion–free media.

For the problem of signal propagation the following terms are used to describe the
delay of the various parts of a signal envelope. The delay times have been analyzed
for instance in the text book on Fourier Transform by Papoulis [20]:

vϕ = ω/k
vg = dω/dk
vs ≡ vg,

tϕ(ω) = ϕ(ω)/ω
tg(ω) = dϕ(ω)/dω
tf r(ω) = lim

delay, see Fig. 4 [20]. ϕ = kz is the phase in a medium at length z. The frequency–

does not tend to a straight line as ω tends to inﬁnity, then the term signal front delay
has no meaning [1, 20]. This behaviour takes place in the case of frequency–band
limited signals in any medium and in the case of tunnelling, where the wave number is
imaginary and thus the angle ϕ does not depend on length z. If the signal is narrow-
band limited, there is no distortion of the envelope. Therefore the delay of the signal
envelope is assumed to equal the delay of the center of gravity [20].

The classical luminal forerunners [1, 2, 22] don’t exist in the case of a tunnelling
signal containing evanescent modes only. Luminal forerunners exist only in dispersive
media with a ﬁnite real refractive index.

3 Superluminal Signals

Since Helmholtz and Schr¨odinger equations are mathematically identical, it is evident
that the three kinds of barriers displayed in Fig. 3 can be used to model the one–
dimensional process of wave mechanical tunnelling [5, 6].

Some superluminal data obtained with the historical double–prism experiment are
presented in the following [5, 6, 23, 24]. This smart experiment elucidates in a brilliant
way the time behaviour of the tunnelling process [25].

Figure 5 indicates that for an angle of incidence greater than the angle of total
reﬂection the barrier transmission time of the double–prism, or what we call here the
tunnelling time can be split into two components

one along the surface due to the Goos-H¨anchen shift D, and another part perpendicular
to the surface [23, 25]. The measured tunnelling time ttunnel represents the group time
delay which results in the group or signal velocity (see Eq. (3)).

The ﬁrst component of ttunnel is related to a non-evanescent wave characterized

ttunnel = tk + t⊥,

while the second one

is related to the evanescent mode traversing the gap between the two prisms. k0 =
2π/λ0, where λ0 is the corresponding vacuum wavelength, and n1 the refractive index
of both prisms. Details of the experiment are given in [23].

In the symmetrical design of the experiment displayed in Fig. 5 the reﬂected and
the tunnelled signal leave the ﬁrst and the second prisms at the same time. This result
represents an experimental proof that for the tunnelling time component t⊥ holds t⊥
= 0. It is in agreement with the observations on other photonic tunnelling structures:
The ﬁnite measured tunnelling time accrues at the entrance boundary and no time is
spent inside a barrier.

A couple of months after the discovery of superluminal tunnelling of microwave
signals [26] a study on superluminal group velocity and transmission of single optical
photons tunnelling a photonic barrier was published [27]. Yes certainly, as the au-
thors claimed they did not measure a signal velocity as the photons were emitted in
a spontaneous process. However, the group velocity of the investigated black box (i.e.
the tunnelling barrier) has been determined and the data are also valid for the trans-
mission of signals. Sending signals containing millions of optical photons analogous to
the microwave experiment, the black box would result in the same superluminal group
velocity as in the single photon experiment. In fact the same experimental set-up and
procedure have been proven with a sample of bulk glass instead of the tunnelling bar-
rier this black box analogy to be correct [28]. Actually in this case the single photon
experiment yielded the sub-luminal group velocity known from bulk glass as measured
in standard spectroscopy. In both in the microwave and in the single photon experi-
ments the group velocity has been measured with a detector located in free space far
away from the investigated black box. In such asymptotic measurements the relation
(3) holds, i.e. the group velocity equals the signal velocity.

4 Does Superluminal Signals Violate

The Principle Of Causality?

Photonic tunnelling experiments have revealed superluminal signal velocities [19, 23,
26] as well as superluminal group and energy velocities [27] of single photons. Accord-
ing to textbooks a superluminal signal velocity violates Einstein causality implying
that cause and eﬀect can be changed and time machines known from science ﬁc-
tion could be constructed. This interpretation, however, assumes a signal to be a
point in the time dimension neglecting its ﬁnite duration. Can a signal travelling
faster than light really violate the principle of causality stating that cause precedes
eﬀect [29]? The latter question has been widely assumed as a matter of fact and it
has allegedly been shown that a signal velocity faster than light allows to change the
past. The line of arguments how to manipulate the past in this case is illustrated in
Fig. 6 [3, 10, 11, 12, 13]. There are two frames of reference displayed. In the ﬁrst one
at the time t = 0 lottery numbers are presented, whereas at t = −10 ps the counters
were closed. Mary (A) sends the lottery numbers to her friend Susan (B) with a
signal velocity of 4 c. Susan, moving in the second inertial system at a relative speed
of 0.75 c, sends the numbers back at a speed of 2 c, which arrives in the ﬁrst system
at t = −50 ps, thus in time to deliver the correct lottery numbers before the counters
close at t = −10 ps.

signal velocity vs = 4 c and B v′
s = 2 c. The numbers in the example are chosen according
to [29]. The signal returns -50 ps in the past in A.

The time shift of a point on the time coordinate of the reference system A into the

past is given by the relation [11, 29]:

where L is the transmission length of the signal, vr is the velocity between the
two inertial systems A and B. The condition for the change of chronological order is
tA ≤ 0, the time shift between the systems A and B.

In the experiments displayed in Fig. 1 the signals travelled at a superluminal ve-
locity with −c/310 [18] and with 4.7 c [19] , respectively. Nevertheless, the principle of
causality has not been violated in both experiments. In the example with the lottery
data the signal was assumed to be a point on the time coordinate. However, a signal
has a ﬁnite duration as the pulses sketched along the time coordinate in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7 In contrast to Fig. 6 the pulse has now a ﬁnite duration of 200 ps. This data is
used for a clear demonstration of the eﬀect. In both experiments, the signal length is long
compared with the measured negative time shift in spite of the superluminal signal velocity.
A signal envelope ends generally in the future.

The two signals presented in Fig. 1 have lengths of 7 µs and 4 ns. Any signal like a
bit, a word or a sentence has a ﬁnite extension on the time coordinate. Assuming in our
example a signal’s ﬁnite duration of 200 ps the complete information is obtained with
superluminal velocity but only at positive times under the assumptions illustrated in
Fig. 7. The same holds a fortiori for the two presented experiments. The ﬁnite duration
of a signal is the reason that a superluminal velocity does not violate the principle
of causality. A shorter signal with the same information (such a transform is done
frequently in modern transmission technology) has an equivalently broader frequency
band. In this case as a result of the dispersion relations of tunnelling barriers or of any
interaction a pulse reshaping would take place. Such a pulse reshaping is demonstrated
[30].
in Fig. 8, details are presented in Ref.

The pulse reshaping is a result of a discontinuous leading front and an unlimited
frequency–band. Both shape and half width are changed during the tunnelling process.

Fig. 8 Comparison of normalized intensity vs time of an air born signal (solid line) and a
simulated tunnelled signal (dotted line) moving from right to left. The signals have a discon-
tinuous beginning and the frequency band is unlimited. The tunnelled pulse is attenuated
and reshaped. Moreover, although its maximum has travelled at superluminal speed, both
fronts have traversed the same distance with the light velocity in vacuum. Here ξ is the
maximum of the tunnelled pulse, a is the shift of the maximum, σ is the variance of the
tunnelling signal, and σ0 is the variance of the air born pulse. It is obvious that the latter is
longer than the variance of the tunnelled pulse.

5 Summing up

Evanescent modes show some amazing properties to which we are not used to from
classical physics. Apparently evanescent modes are nonlocal ﬁelds and represented by
virtuell photons [31]. Evanescent modes are easily traceable through barriers some
100 wavelengths thick and they do not spend time in the barrier. The latter is an
experimental result due to the fact that the transmission time is independent of barrier
length (Hartman eﬀect [32, 33, 34]). Another proof of this behaviour is observed in the
case of symmetrical Frustrated Total Internal Reﬂection (FTIR), where the reﬂected
and the transmitted signal have the same delay time, i.e. the time spent inside the
barrier is zero. The measured ﬁnite transmission time comes into existence at the
entrance boundary of the photonic barriers.

In conclusion the principle of causality has not been violated by superluminal
signals as a result of the ﬁnite signal length and the corresponding frequency-band
width. But amazingly enough the time span between cause and eﬀect is reduced by a
superluminal signal velocity compared with luminal cause to eﬀect propagation.

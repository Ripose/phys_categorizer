Abstract

Eﬀect of guiding magnetic ﬁeld on evolution of stimulated emission is con-
sidered. It is shown that the transverse dynamics of electrons contributes to
generation process and that contribution decreases with the magnetic ﬁeld
grows. The equation of generation for stimulated radiation of electron beam
passing over periodic medium in magnetic ﬁeld of arbitrary value is derived.
The critical value of guiding ﬁeld for which the transverse dynamics of elec-
tron don’t contribute to emission is determined. It is shown, that transverse
dynamics of electron modiﬁes the boundary conditions. It follows from the
derived generation equation that transverse dynamics yields to ∼ 25% in-
crease of the increment magnitude in high gain regime. In the limit of small
signal the generation gain twice increases when transverse dynamics evolves.
Obtained results are valid for every FEL system, which use the mechanism of
waves slowing in the slow-wave structures for generation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The various types of devices utilizing the electron beam interaction with electromagnetic
ﬁelds in slow-wave system (Cherenkov [1], Smith-Purcell [3], quasi-Cherenkov [2], transition
[4] radiation mechanisms) was considered in the past.The great number of researches in the
area of microwave electronics resulted in the traveling wave tube (TWT), backward-wave
oscillator (BWO), orotrons and so on. Theory of such generators, as a rule, considers the
one-dimentional (longitudinal) dynamics of electrons in the ﬁeld of an electromagnetic wave.
On the other hand in our previous works devoted to quasi-Cherenkov FEL the stimulated
emission of unmagnetized electron beam with three - dimensional dynamics was studied
In our works [8], [9] the guiding ﬁeld was considered as strong and the
( [5], [6], [7]).
electron beam dynamics as one-dimensional.
It was shown that quasi-Cherenkov volume
FEL (VFEL) can produce radiation with lower current density (especially in X-ray spectrum
region of frequencies) in comparison with ordinary FELs. However, multiple scattering of
electrons in the medium destructs the coherence of radiation process. The surface scheme
of the quasi-Cherenkov VFEL can be used for multiple scattering reducing ( [8], [9]). In
that case an electron beam moves over a periodic medium at a distance d ≤

is formed along the whole electron trajectory in vacuum without multiple scattering.
these works ( [8], [9]) the generation of the surface parametric FEL was considered for
electron beam placed in strong longitudinal guiding magnetic ﬁeld. So, only the contribution
of the one-dimensional (longitudinal) dynamics of electrons to stimulated radiation was

considered. This is true if inequality

eH (0)
mγc∆

≫ 1 is satisﬁed (H (0) is the magnitude of

magnetic ﬁeld, ∆ is the detuning from synchronism condition). In opposite case

it is necessary to take into account the transverse motion of electrons. The ∆ increases
with the interaction length L∗ decrease ( L∗ is the length of interaction between the electron
beam and radiation) and with the current density increase. Therefore the transverse motion
contributes to stimulated quasi-Cherenkov emission in the case of high current or small

interaction length (

frequency).

In this paper we present the analysis of volume FEL (VFEL) operation in the periodic
slow-wave structures including the eﬀect of the ﬁnite guiding magnetic ﬁeld value on stimu-
lated emission. So we take into account the contribution of transverse electron beam motion
to generation process. Using the linearized perturbation ﬁeld approximation we derive the
boundary conditions, dispersion relations and generation equation. All results received be-
low relate to Compton regime, when the amplitudes of excited longitudinal Langmuir waves
are small. Raman regime was considered in our previos work [10] in two limiting cases
1)when guiding magnetic ﬁeld is absent; 2)when guiding ﬁeld is strong.

II. THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

The considered system is represented on Figure 1. An electron beam located at height h
over the spatial periodic structure is moving parallel to structure surface. δ is the beam thick-
ness in the direction normal to the surface. The axis x is chosen along the direction of elec-
tron motion, the axis z is normal to the periodic structure surface. Dynamical diﬀraction on
the periodic structure forms the 3-dimensional volume distribution feedback which provides
generation regime. The set of reciprocal lattice vectors τn = {2πn1/d1; 2πn2/d2; 2πn3/d3}
deﬁning diﬀraction process can be directed at an arbitrary angle relative to the particle ve-
locity and to the surface, (di are translation periods of periodic structure, ni are intergers).
The interaction between the electron beam and the grating produces an emission spectrum.
The emission frequency is deﬁned by the spatial period and by the volume geometry (by the
direction of the reciprocal vectors for example). The periodic structure perfoms two basic
functions. Firstly it slows down the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave that enables
conditions for coherent radiation. Secondly, due to 3-dimensional distributed feedback, the
periodic structure is an eﬀective volume resonator,which gives the possibility for an oscillator
regime realization. The emitted photons bunch the electron beam. This bunching leads to
greater emission, which leads to more bunching.Three-dimensional Bragg distributed feed-
back keeps emission in the interaction region. The regime of an oscillator is realized as
the result of these processes. Dependence of the emitted wavelength on system geometry

provides smooth frequency tuning. For deriving the generation equation it is necessary to
obtain the dispersion equations in all regions and to use the boundary conditions on the
surfaces of the electron beam and surfaces of the slow-wave structure.

III. DISPERSION EQUATIONS

In most of previous works concerning slow-wave FELs the electron beam is considered
as magnetized. Therefore only longitudinal dynamics of electron beam was taken into ac-
count. The magnetic ﬁeld is used for electron beam guiding over slow-wave structure surface.
However, the transverse motion of electron still can contribute to the process of stimulated
radiation. The contribution of transverse degrees of freedom depends on: 1) parameters of
an electron beam such as the energy of electrons, current density, the velocity spread of an
electron beam; 2) the parameters of emitted radiation such as photon wavelength and the
ﬁeld amplitudes; 3) the parameters of the electrodynamical structure such as photoabsop-
tion length, interaction length of electron beam with emitted radiation and the binding of an
electron beam with eigenmodes of an electrodynamic system; 4) the magnitude of guiding
ﬁeld.

The slow electromagnetic wave which is in synhronism with the electron beam produces
modulation of the density and current density. This leads to development of instability. The
stimulated radiation is the result of this instability. Let us consider the inﬂuence of guiding
magnetic ﬁeld on the stimulated radiation. The velocity and radius-vector of an electron
can be presented as: vα(t) = u + δvα(t), rα(t) = r0α + ut + δrα(t). Here the pertubations
δvα(t) and δrα(t) are results of electron interaction with an electromagnetic wave. In the
linear ﬁeld approximation the current density can be written as

j(z, kx, ky, ω) = eXα

(3.1)

where xα(t) = x0α + ut + δxα(t), yα(t) = y0α + ut + δyα(t), zα(t) = z0α +
δzα(t) are the radius vectors of an electrons in a beam and {δxα, δzα, δvα}(ω) =

Current density contains terms with Cherenkov and cyclotron resonances. We shall study
the Compton regime of Cherenkov instability. The terms corresponding to second order
resonances give maximal contributions in that case. Below we use this fact for separation
of wave polarisations.

The dispersion equation in the region ﬁlled with electron beam is deﬁned by equating of

the determinant of the system to zero.

Here δj(k, ω) is derived from (3.4) (δj(z, kx, ky, ω) ∼ δj(k, ω) exp(ikzz). It is considered in
this case that f (z) = 1 in the region with electron beam).

Let us discuss some features of this dispersion equation. In general case of an arbitrary
guiding magnetic ﬁeld it has six roots kza(kx, ky, ω), a = 1 ÷6. For the case of strong guiding

magnetic ﬁeld when the condition ω − ku <<

where uα(r) satisﬁes to conditions uα(r + di) = uα(r) and di is arbitrary translation vector

IV. THE BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

To derive the generation conditions it is necessary to write the equations for ﬁeld coef-
ﬁcient in (3.7,3.8,3.9). These equations are produced by utilizing the boundary conditions
on the surfaces. If the surface currents and surface charges are not excited on the bound-
ary, then we shall use the conditions of transverse magnetic and electric ﬁeld continuity
on the boundary.In general case, as will be shown below, the induced surface currents and
charges exist at the electron beam surfaces. For deﬁning of this currents and deriving of
corresponding boundary conditions the consideration of self-consistent problem of electron
beam-radiation interaction should be performed. To produce the boundary condition for
tangential component of magnetic ﬁeld we use (3.4) and Maxwell equation

rotH =

(4.1)

By integrating left and right hand sides (4.1) in narrow region near the electron beam surface
and using (3.4), it can be derived the following boundary conditions

As can be seen from (4.2) the tangential component of magnetic ﬁeld which is normal to
electron beam velocity u don’t conserve on the electron beam surfaces. The component of

6

magnetic ﬁeld parallel to velocity is conserved. The nonconserving of Hy on the electron
beam density discontinuity is caused by arising of surface current directed along the electron
velocity vector u. The following limit cases of boundary conditions (4.2) exist.

1) the limit of strong guiding magnetic ﬁeld ∆ << a0, the y component of magnetic
ﬁeld is conserved. That is result of transverse dynamics lack in strong longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld;

2) the opposite limit of weak guiding ﬁeld ∆ >> a0, in this case the boundary condition

In (5.8) the function N(k, k1, ..., kn, ω) describes the ”cold” slow-wave system. It is easy

The terms related with electron beam diﬀer in two times. It is result of transverse dynamics
lack in the case of (5.9). In the case of slow guiding magnetic ﬁeld (5.10) the transverse
motion and longitudinal motion give the same contribution to generation process.

VI. INCREMENTS OF QUASI-CHERENKOV INSTABILITY

The slow electromagnetic wave produces the modulation in the electron current and this
modulation forms the coherent quasi-Cherenkov radiation which acts on the electron beam
again. As the result the emission increases during the process of ”electron beam - radiation”
interaction in the slow-wave system. Dynamics of this process can be described by the
increment of instability. Received generation equation (5.8) will be used for calculation of
increment.

Expanding the equation (5.8) in vicinity of Cherenkov resonance and in vicinity of the

eigenmode of slow-wave system the generation equation can be written in the form

. The dependence of increment on the value of

right hand side of (6.1). As was shown in [7], the N0 is proportional to absorption losses of

of great photoabsoption losses (|N0| ≫ |

root degeneration point dependence of increment on current density changes ν ∼ j1/(2+s),
where s is the number of degenerated modes.The dependence of increment on the magnitude
of guiding ﬁeld is presented on (Figure 2, Figure 3) for current density j = 10 A/cm2 (Figure
2) and j = 100 A/cm2 (Figure 3). The following parameters were taken: ω ∼ 5 ·1011s−1,
u ∼ 1.4 · 1010cm/s. It follows from (Figure 2, Figure 3) that for the magnitude of magnetic
H0 = 3 KGs only longitudinal motions of electron contributes to stimulated emission if the
current density j = 10 A/cm2. If j = 100 A/cm2, the critical magnitude of the guiding ﬁeld
is H0 ≈ 6 KGs. If guiding ﬁeld less these values, the transverse dynamics contributes to
emission also.

sion of electron beam. The following simple estimation for guiding ﬁeld can be used: 1) the
deviation from the Cherenkov synchronism ∆ must be less the width of stimulated emission
line

|δ∆| ∼ ωδvx/u + ωδvz/γu ≤ max{πu/Lint; βων},

(7.1)

where δvx and δvz are velocity pertubations caused by Coulomb repulsion, 2) the ampli-

eH 2 < h.

tude of oscillation in crossed ﬁelds can be less then the gap width h:
If
period of transverse electron oscillations in guiding magnetic ﬁeld less then interaction time
(ωHL/v ≥ 1), then (7.1) can be writen as ωcE/γ2uH ≤ max{πu/Lint; βων}. Take into
2πmc2I
eH 2ulγ2 < h where l is the
width of an electron beam along the y axis, I is the beam current.So, if the inequalities

, 2πωcI/(u2lH) ≤ max{πu/Lint; βων},

account that E ∼

max{

; 2πωcI/(γ2u2lH)} < max{πu/Lint; βων} are fulﬁlled, then the transverse dy-
namics of electrons contributes to generation process. As was shown above the transverse
dynamics contributes to stimulated emission for magnitude of guiding magnetic ﬁeld ≤ few
KGs. The transverse electron dynamics can increase the increment on 25 percent in the
high gain exponentional regime as can be seen from (Figure 2, Figure 3). In the slow gain
regime the magnitude of the gain can increase in two times due to transverse dynamics.

Abstract

We present measurements of the energy loss of pions and electrons in drift cham-
bers operated with a Xe,CO2(15%) mixture. The measurements are carried out for
particle momenta from 1 to 6 GeV/c using prototype drift chambers for the ALICE
TRD. Microscopic calculations are performed using input parameters calculated
with GEANT3. These calculations reproduce well the measured average and most
probable values for pions, but a higher Fermi plateau is required in order to repro-
duce our electron data. The widths of the measured distributions are smaller for
data compared to the calculations. The electron/pion identiﬁcation performance
using the energy loss is also presented.

1 Introduction

The ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) [1] is designed to provide electron iden-
tiﬁcation and particle tracking in the high-multiplicity heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.
To achieve the challenging goals of the detector, accurate pulse height measurement in
drift chambers operated with Xe,CO2(15%) over the drift time of about 2 µs is a nec-
essary requirement. For such precision measurements, it is of particular importance ﬁrst
to collect [2] and then to properly amplify [3] all the charge deposited in the detector.
For electrons, the transition radiation (TR), produced in an especially designed raditor,
is overimposed on the ionization energy loss and helps crucially in improving the elec-
tron/pion separation. A factor of 100 pion rejection for 90% electron eﬃciency is the
design goal of the detector and was demonstrated with prototypes [1]. The measurements
of ionization energy loss (dE/dx) in TRD will contribute to the identiﬁcation of other
charged particles, supplementing the identiﬁcation power of the ALICE Time Projection
Chamber. A good understanding of dE/dx in the TRD is a prerequisite for high-precision
simulations of the detector performance in terms of TR.

Existing measurements of dE/dx in Xe-based mixtures [4,5,6] are scarce and have good
precision on an absolute energy scale only in one case [6]. Calculations of dE/dx can
reproduce the measured data, in particular for Xe-based mixtures [6,7]. Ref. [8] is an
excellent early overview on energy loss measurements and calculations as well as on its
application to particle identiﬁcation. For a more recent account, see ref. [9].

We report on dE/dx measurements performed during prototype tests for the ALICE TRD.
The experimental setup and method of data analysis are described in the next section. We
then present the basic ingredients of our simulation code and discuss the general outcome.
The measured data in comparison to the calculations are presented in Section 4.

2 Experimental setup

The results are obtained using prototype drift chambers (DC) with a construction sim-
ilar to that anticipated for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD [1], but with a smaller active area

(25×32 cm2). To allow the measurement of the pure ionization energy loss for electrons,
no radiator was used for the present measurements. The prototypes have a drift region of
30 mm and an ampliﬁcation region of 7 mm. Anode wires (W-Au) of 20 µm diameter are
used, with a pitch of 5 mm. The cathode wires (Cu-Be) have 75 µm diameter and a pitch
of 2.5 mm. We read out the signal on a segmented cathode plane with rectangular pads of
8 cm length and 0.75 cm width. The entrance window (25 µm aluminized Kapton) simul-
taneously serves as gas barrier and as drift electrode. We operate the drift chambers with
the standard gas mixture for the TRD, Xe,CO2(15%), at atmospheric pressure. The gas
is recirculated using a dedicated gas system. Our nominal gain of about 4000 is achieved
with an anode voltage of 1.55 kV. For our nominal drift ﬁeld of 0.7 kV/cm, the detector
signal is spread over about 2 µs.

We use a prototype of the charge-sensitive preampliﬁer/shaper (PASA) especially de-
signed and built for the TRD in 0.35 µm CMOS technology. It has a noise on-detector
of about 1000 electrons r.m.s. and the FWHM of the output pulse is about 100 ns for an
input step function. The nominal gain of the PASA is 12 mV/fC, but during the present
measurements we use a gain of 6 mV/fC for a better match to the range of the employed
Flash ADC (FADC) system with 0.6 V voltage swing. The FADC has adjustable baseline,
an 8-bit non-linear conversion and 20 MHz sampling frequency. The FADC sampling was
rebinned in the oﬀ-line analysis to obtain 100 ns time bins as for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD
[1]. The data acquisition (DAQ) was based on a VME event builder and was developed
at GSI [15].

The energy calibration of the detectors has been performed using a 55Fe X-ray source. A
spectrum of the integrated 55Fe signal is shown in Fig. 1 for our nominal anode voltage
of 1.55 kV. The spectrum has been calibrated with one gain parameter (the baseline is
obtained using empty presamples, there is no oﬀset) using the main peak of 5.96 keV. The
arrow marks the expected position of the escape peak of Xe at 1.76 keV, (the weighted
average of the L lines of Xe is 4.202 keV), which is in good agreement with the measure-
ments. The energy resolution for the main peak is 23% FWHM.

Four identical drift chambers were used for the beam measurements, without any radiator
in front. The variation of the gas gain for each individual chamber is within 10% and is
calibrated away. The measurements are carried out at momenta of 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
6 GeV/c at the T10 secondary beamline of the CERN PS [16]. The momentum resolution
is ∆p/p ≃ 1%. The beam intensity is up to 3000 particles per spill of about 1 second.
As the beam diameter was of the order of 2.5 cm, we usually limited the readout of the
DC to 8 pads. This also minimizes data transfer on the VSB bus connecting the FADC
and the event builder. The beam is a mixture of electrons and negative pions. Similar
sample sizes of pion and electron events are acquired within the same run via dedicated
triggers. For the present analysis we have selected clean samples of pions and electrons
using coincident thresholds on two Cherenkov detectors and on a lead-glass calorimeter
[17]. The incident angle of the beam with respect to the normal to the anode wires (drift
direction)is 15◦ to avoid gas gain saturation due to space charge [3].

3 Procedure and inputs for energy loss calculations

The calculations are performed using a standalone Monte Carlo program especially writ-
ten for this purpose. In general, the ingredients needed for calculating the ionization
energy loss of an incoming charged particle in any material are just the number of the
primary inelastic collisions and the spectrum of the energy transfer in these collisions.
These quantities depend on the particle type and momentum (or Lorentz factor γ) and
on the medium traversed. In our case, the inputs were extracted from GEANT3 [10].

The energy spectrum of primary electrons released in inelastic collisions of a minimum
ionizing particle (MIP, γ=4) is presented in Fig. 2. In GEANT3 an implementation of
the photoabsorption ionization model [8] is used to calculate this spectrum. This is the
integral spectrum of the number of the inelastic collisions per centimeter with an energy
transfer greater than E, (dN/dx)>E. For comparison, we plot also, arbitrarily normalized,
the pure Rutherford spectrum, which, in the integral form, has a 1/E dependence. The
calculated spectrum has structures coresponding to the atomic shells (most conspicous
are the N and M shells of Xe) and approaches the Rutherford limit for large values of the
energy transfer.

The total number of primary collisions per cm of traversed gas, N, is the value corre-
sponding to the lower limit of the energy transfer and is 19.3 for our case. Note that

this number is much smaller compared than the values quoted in earlier works: 48 by
Ermilova et al. [11] and 44 by Sauli [12] or Zarubin [13]. On the other hand, Va’vra [9] has
recently deduced that N is about 25 for Xe. The lowest value of the energy transfer in the
GEANT3 spectrum is 11.26 eV [10]. Since the value of the lowest ionization potential for
Xe is I=12.13 eV (for CO2 I=13.81 eV) [14], we restrict for our simulations the lowest
energy transfer to this value of 12.13 eV, while keeping unchanged the number of primary
collisions. This threshold leads to an increase of the simulated average energy loss by 4%
compared to the case when 11.26 eV would be the lowest allowed energy transfer.

In addition to the material-dependent values presented above, one has to specify their
dependence on the incoming particle’s Lorentz factor, γ. We assume that the spectral
shape of the energy transfer is independent of γ and only the total number of primary
collisions depends on γ. This factor, f , is the relative increase of N with respect to the
value for MIP. Its dependence, as extracted from GEANT3, is presented in Fig. 3 for
our gas mixture. Note that in GEANT3 the Fermi plateau corresponds to a number of
primary inelastic collisions 1.55 times larger with respect to MIP. This value is sizeably
larger than the value of 1.36 calculated by Ermilova et al. [11]. As we shall see below, our
measurements favor an even higher Fermi plateau than that extracted from GEANT3, of
about 1.61. This is shown by the dashed line in Fig. 3. For a given detector thickness D and
for a given γ value, the spectrum presented in Fig. 2 is sampled on average Ntot = NDf (γ)
times. For an individual track, the actual number of inelastic collisions is obtained by
sampling a Poissonian distribution with the average Ntot.

The δ-rays (energetic electrons produced in inelastic collisions) are tracked for energies
above 10 keV. This class is what we denote here generically δ-rays (there is no accepted
threshold above which a primary electron is called δ-ray). For these electrons the range is
calculated according to the formula [14]:

with A=5.37·10−4 gcm−2keV−1, B=0.9815, and C=3.123·10−3 keV−1 [14]. E is the energy
of the δ-ray. For instance, for our gas mixture, the range is 0.52 mm for 10 keV and 27.4 mm
for 100 keV δ-rays. We assume that the δ-rays move on a straight trajectory co-linear with
the parent particle. If a δ-ray was produced in the detector depth such that the range
is greater than the remaining path length of the parent track in the detector, the γ of
the δ-ray is calculated and its energy deposit is treated as for an independent track and
added to the parent track. For our detector geometry, 15.3% of the tracks of 2 GeV/c
pions have a δ-ray above 10 keV. Of those, 16.3% (or 2.5% of all the tracks) escape from
the detector volume.

In Fig. 4 we present the comparison of the energy loss integrated over the detector thick-
ness, ∆, for pions of 2 GeV/c. The four cases are for: i) all tracks, ii) tracks not containing
any δ-ray, ii) tracks with δ-ray, but which are completely absorbed in the detector, and

contained in the detector (dotted) and iv) tracks for which a δ-ray has escaped the detector
volume (dot-dashed).

iv) tracks for which one δ-ray escapes the detector. For this last case the energy loss in
this example is calculated taking the total energy of the δ-ray. These spectra illustrate the
contribution of δ-rays to the well known Landau shape of energy loss in thin detectors:
the tail originates from the tracks for which one or more δ-rays have been produced [6].
Depending on the detector thickness, some of those will escape the detection volume. This
leads to the distinction between the energy loss and the energy deposit, which comprises
only the detected signal (and is obviously smaller than the energy loss). The ﬂat energy
loss distribution for tracks containing escaped δ-rays (dot-dashed histogram) is the result
of the random distribution of these δ-rays in the detector thickness: the lower energy
δ-rays escape only if they are produced at the end of the path of the parent particle in
the detector, while the very energetic ones escape no matter where they are produced.

4 Results and discussion

In Fig. 5 we present the measured distributions of energy loss for pions and electrons for
the momentum of 2 GeV/c. Our high-statistics measurements with FADCs with large
dynamic range make available for the ﬁrst time complete energy loss spectra. A very good
agreement between data and calculations is seen for the case of δ-rays escaping the detector

the reason why the most probable value (MPV) of the spectrum and not its mean value
is most commonly used to characterize the energy loss in thin detectors. From here on
we consider only the simulated results taking into account the tracking of escaped δ-rays.
The measurements for all momenta are presented in Fig. 6 together with simulations. One
can notice that, due to the relativistic rise of the pions, the separation between the pions
and electrons is reduced as a function of momentum. This is the reason why one employs
the extra contribution of transition radiation in order to achieve a good electron/pion
identiﬁcation with a TRD. In general, the agreement between data and calculations is
good for all momenta, but on a linear scale one can already notice that the widths of the
distributions are larger in case of simulations (see below). The calculated distributions
are for the modiﬁed Fermi plateau. All the measured spectra are available at the web
page of our collaboration [18]. Note that, due to the track incidence at 15◦ with respect
to the normal incidence, the distributions correspond to an eﬀective detector thickness of
3.83 cm.

to-point accuracy, originating from minute changes of the gas composition and pressure.
We estimate an overall uncertainty of the absolute energy calibration of about 5%. The
statistical error of the Landau ﬁt is negligible. As noted earlier, for our momentum values,
the pions are in the regime of the relativistic rise, while the electrons are at the Fermi
plateau. These two regimes are reﬂected in the measured values of the energy loss. Note
that our average values for electrons are lower than those reported by Fischer et al. [4],
who measured a value of about 9 keV/cm at the Fermi plateau. Appuhn et al. [19] have
reported for electrons even larger values of about 12 keV/cm, with a slightly increasing
trend for the same momentum range as ours.

The calculations reproduce well the absolute magnitude and the general trends of the
data, however, in case of electrons, only with the modiﬁed value of the Fermi plateau.
The calculations show a more pronounced relativistic rise than the measurements. Also, in
case of the average values, the calculations indicate that the Fermi plateau is reached for

the electrons for all momentum values, while the data show a slight increase for momenta
below 2 GeV/c. Despite the above-mentioned 5% overall uncertainty of the measured
values, it is evident that the calculations cannot consistently explain the measured values
for pions and electrons unless one introduces the modiﬁed Fermi plateau.

Fig. 8. Momentum dependence of the FWHM value of the energy loss normalized to MPV for
pions and electrons. Full symbols are measurements, open symbols are calculations.

The comparion of the measured and simulated values of the FWHM of the energy loss
spectra, normalized to MPV, is shown in Fig. 8 for pions and electrons as a function of
particle momentum. The FWHM is determined by the magnitude of the ionization, in
particular by the average number of primary inelastic collisions. For pions, as a conse-
quence of the relativistic rise, one expects that the FWHM is decreasing as a function of
momentum and this is indeed the trend of our measured values. For electrons, due to their
constant energy loss, the FWHM is expected to be constant, but the measurements show
a slight increase as a function of momentum. This is not quantitatively understood, but
Bremsstrahlung is the only candidate to explain such a behavior. Our measured values
for pions are larger than those reported in ref. [20] by about 15%.

The calculations reproduce the measured trend for pions, but show clearly larger values of
FWHM. The expected constant value of FWHM for electrons is conﬁrmed by the calcu-
lations. Bremsstrahlung is not included for the simulated events. Larger FWHMs in case
of calculations may be a consequence of too low a number of primary inelastic collisions
predicted by GEANT. Obviously, one can not increase this number unconditionally. The
spectrum of the energy transfer has to be changed in this case too, otherwise the average
values of dE/dx would no longer be in agreement with the measurements. As emphasized

11

by the authors of GEANT3 [10], the shape of the energy transfer spectrum at low energy
is strongly dependent on the choice and treatment of the photo-absorption cross sections.
If the FWHM is only determined by the number of primary collisions, a simple Poisson
scaling implies that about 25 primary collisions per cm would be required for an agreement
between our measurements and the simulations in case of pions. This value is identical
to the one inferred by Va’vra [9]. Another possibility is that for the measurements the
Penning eﬀect increases the secondary electron statistics [13,21]. We note that similarly
larger widths of simulated distributions compared to measurements are also apparent in
ref. [7].

are compared to calculations and to the measurements of Fischer et al. [4], Walenta et al. [5]
and Herold et al. [6]. The dashed line is the result of GEANT4 calculations [7].

In Fig. 9 we present the relativistic rise of the most probable value of the energy loss. Our
data are compared to other measurements [4,5,6] and to calculations. For this relative
comparison, we have normalized our measured value for 3 GeV/c pions (γ=21) to the
calculations. Note that the absolute MPVs of data and calculations agree perfectly at this
momentum value (see Fig. 7). The agreement with existing measurements is very good.
In particular, we would like to emphasize the perfect agreement with the Fermi plateau
value of Walenta et al. [5]. As expected from the previous comparisons, the calculations
reproduce the data well, but only in case of the modiﬁed Fermi plateau. The results of
GEANT4 calculations [7] are included as well. The value of the Fermi plateau in GEANT4
is very close to the GEANT3 case and, as a consequence, underpredicts our measurements.
The approach to the plateau is more gradual in case of GEANT4 and this agrees with

12

the measurements of Herold et al. [6], which are clearly overpredicted by our calculations.
A Fermi plateau of about 1.98 was calculated [4] using the density eﬀect correction of
Sternheimer and Peierls [22]. On the other hand, Cobb et al. [23] have calculated a value
of 1.73, very close to our measured value. Note that the value of the Fermi plateau in the
case of MPV, 1.75, is larger compared to the corresponding value for the average energy
loss, 1.61 (which is obviously identical to the input value for the Fermi plateau of the
number of primary collisions), and the onset of the plateau starts at somewhat larger
values of γ (see also Fig. 3) [24].

The results presented above allow the calculation of the electron/pion rejection using pure
dE/dx measurements. The results are presented in Fig. 10. A likelihood method [25] on
the total energy loss spectra (see Fig. 7) has been used to extract the pion eﬃciencies for
90% electron eﬃciency. The measured experimental data for 4 layers has been used to
calculate the expected performance for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD conﬁguration with 6 layers.
The experimental errors are of the order of the dimension of the points. The data are
compared to the performance extracted from the simulations using an identical procedure.
Clearly, the modiﬁed Fermi plateau is needed in order to explain the measured pion
eﬃciencies. Moreover, as a result of the faster relativistic rise in the simulations compared
to the data, the simulations show a degradation of the pion rejection performance which is
steeper than the measurements. The larger widths of the simulated Landau distributions
play a role, too.

In ALICE TRD the contribution of TR is signiﬁcantly improving the electron identiﬁca-
tion performance [17]. Pion eﬃciencies below 1% have been achieved in tests with pro-
totypes [17]. However, particle identiﬁcation using dE/dx will be used for other charged
particles, for which truncated means could be a more advantageous way to exploit the
measured signal. In case of electron/pion separation, the comparison of measurements
and calculations in terms of pure dE/dx is just a necessary step in understanding the
contribution of TR, in particular the comparison between measurements and simulations
of the TRD performance.

5 Summary

We have reported measurements of ionization energy loss in drift chambers operated with
Xe,CO2(15%), carried out using prototype drift chambers for the ALICE TRD. Pions and
electrons with momenta from 1 to 6 GeV/c were studied. Our high-statistics measurements
with FADCs with large dynamic range make available for the ﬁrst time complete energy
loss spectra. Our measured relativistic rise agrees well with existing measurements. The
measured distributions are in general well reproduced using microscopic calculations with
GEANT3 input parameters, but a modiﬁed value of the Fermi plateau (an increase from
1.55 to 1.61) is needed to explain the electron data. The calculations show wider distribu-
tions compared to the measurements, suggesting that the number of primary collisions is
too low in the standard GEANT3 input values. Apparently, all the noticed discrepancies
between data and GEANT3 will apply in case of GEANT4, too.

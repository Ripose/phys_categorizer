In 1998, the detector H1 at HERA has been equipped with a small backward spectrom-
eter, the Very Low Q2 (VLQ) spectrometer comprising a silicon tracker, a tungsten - scin-
tillator sandwich calorimeter, and a Time-of-Flight system. The spectrometer was designed
to measure electrons scattered under very low angles, equivalent to very low squared four -
momentum transfers Q2, and high energy photons with good energy and spatial resolution.
The VLQ was in operation during the 1999 and 2000 run periods. This paper describes the
design and construction of the VLQ calorimeter, a compact device with a fourfold projec-
tive energy read-out, and its performance during test runs and in the experiment.

Abstract

1 Introduction

1.1 Physics Motivation

The storage ring HERA at DESY where electrons or positrons of 27.5 GeV collide with protons
of 920 GeV is devoted to the investigation of deep inelastic electron - proton scattering (DIS)
and photoproduction processes. The detector H1 [1] at HERA is equally well equipped for
measuring electrons scattered in deep inelastic, i.e. high Q2, reactions, by virtue of its Liquid
Argon (LAr) [1] and SpaCal [2] calorimeters, and electrons which initiated photoproduction,
i.e. Q2
0, reactions with the help of its low angle (w.r.t. the electron beam direction) electron
spectrometers, called the “electron taggers”.

≈

However, the available range in Q2 which is linked to the electron’s scattering angle is
limited by the inner radius of the SpaCal which corresponds to a minimal Q2 of roughly 0.6
GeV2. Therefore, a large area in phase space cannot be accessed by H1 without the help of a
dedicated device, see Fig. 1 which shows the acceptance range of H1 in a Q2
y map. The
E′/E where E is the energy of the incoming,
variable y is, for vanishing Q2, deﬁned by y = 1
−
E′ that of the scattered electron. Therefore, y = 0 corresponds to vanishing, y = 1 to maximal
photon energy. The region below the SpaCal - covered Q2 range is of special interest because
here the DIS and photoproduction regimes merge: The “transition region”. A measurement of
the structure function F2(W 2, Q2), or equivalently of the total photo-absorption cross section

−

σ(γ∗p) = 4 π2 α/Q2 F2(W 2, Q2),

in this region is expected to shed light on the interplay between soft and hard processes in
electron - proton scattering. The VLQ extends the kinematically accessible range down to
values of Q2 = 0.03.

Furthermore, a measurement of vector meson production in this regime, especially a com-
parison between cross section behaviours for the production of light (ρ0, ω, φ) and heavy (J/ψ,
Υ) mesons, in the transition region will help to improve the understanding of strong interaction
mechanisms [3].

The VLQ calorimeter, which does not distinguish between high energy electrons and pho-
tons, can also serve to measure photons from meson decays, e.g. from π0 or η mesons, or from
heavier particles which decay through these intermediate states. A ﬁeld which gained new in-
terest is meson production via “Odderon” exchange, where the Odderon is the P = C =
1
−
partner of the Pomeron. Odderon - mediated reactions are expected to lead to high energy single
meson production in the “photon hemisphere”, that is in the electron beam direction [4]. The
VLQ is an ideal target for photons from these meson decays [5].

1.2 Detector Design: Constraints and Concept

The VLQ spectrometer consists of two independent modules, each comprising a tracker system
and an electromagnetic calorimeter, followed by a time-of-ﬂight (ToF) system which has the
purpose to recognize background particles travelling along with the proton beam. The phase

space region to be covered dictates the position of the VLQ to be downstream the electron
beam and close to the beam pipe. The space available to install a new detecting device there is
strongly limited, enforcing a very tight structure, and especially a highly compact calorimeter.
The solution chosen is a system of two identical spectrometer modules, one above and one
below the beam line, ﬁxed to a moving mechanics so that the modules can be moved close to
the beam, or retracted, independently. The tracker part and the ToF system connected to the
VLQ spectrometer are described in [6].

The volume available for either VLQ calorimeter module is a box of 16.3 cm length and
transverse dimensions of 15.0 x 18.0 cm2. The calorimeter operates in an energy range up to
the electron beam energy, i.e. roughly 30 GeV. The energy resolution aimed at in this regime
is 3 - 4 %. A material capable to absorb electromagnetic showers of this energy within the
given distance is tungsten, with Z = 72 and a density of 19.3 g/cm3. A sandwich calorimeter
type was chosen in a sophisticated layout which allows a “projective energy read-out”, i.e. a
fourfold projection of the shower proﬁle can be measured along the shower detector: A passive
tungsten 1 plate of 2.5 mm thickness is followed by an active scintillator layer of 3 mm thick-
ness, structured in an array of 24 vertical scintillator bars of 5 mm width each; this double layer
is continued by another tungsten plate and another scintillator layer, arranged in 18 horizontal
scintillator bars of the same width. In total there are 23 tungsten and 24 scintillator layers. The
scintillation light which is guided by total reﬂection is read out at either end of each bar, and
coupled into a wavelength shifter which guides the light towards photodiode detectors.

1For ﬁnancial and machining reasons, the material used consists of 95 % tungsten and a 5 % admixture of

nickel and copper.

2 Calorimeter Design and Construction

2.1 Design Parameters and Optimization

Detection devices positioned very close to the beam pipe are exposed to high doses of syn-
chrotron radiation and background generated by the proton beam. In order to protect the VLQ
from background radiation, a moving mechanism retracts the spectrometer from the beam pipe
during the ﬁlling phase. This condition renders a full 2π coverage in azimuth more difﬁcult and
leaves a two module solution: One module above, and another identical one below the beam
pipe, ﬁxed to the retraction mechanism which moves the modules to well deﬁned measuring
positions. The parameters of the calorimeter described below always refer to a pair of modules.
The structure of a calorimeter module is sketched in Fig. 2 , an “exploded view” is shown in
Fig. 3.

The scintillation material chosen is Bicron BC-408 with a wavelength of maximum emission

of 425 nm, a decay time of the scintillation light of 2.1 ns, and a refractive index of 1.58 [7].

Given the available space and the absorber and scintillator materials, the internal structure of
the calorimeter module has to be optimized. The total length being ﬁxed, the parameters to be
varied are number and thickness of tungsten vs. scintillator plates. The optimization procedure
was carried out using the simulation package GEANT [8]. The optimization criterion is derived
from the behaviour of the relative energy resolution σ(E)/E which is conventionally expanded
in powers of 1/√E:

σ(E)/E = S/√E

Figure 3: “Exploded view” of a calorimeter module.

Here, S/√E is the so called “sampling term” governed by Poisson statistics of shower sam-
pling. C is called the “constant term” saying that the absolute energy resolution σ(E) worsens
with increasing energy. It is mainly due to incomplete shower containment and strongly depen-
dent on the calorimeter size. N/E is the noise term which is not a property of the calorimeter
body itself but given by the readout system. It has the same inﬂuence on the absolute resolution
at any energy, i.e. it is independent of energy.

Optimization of the mechanical layout of the calorimeter can be decoupled from the elec-
tronic read-out [9]. To ﬁnd the best solution, a series of simulations was performed where the
tungsten and scintillator layer thicknesses were varied [9]. The electron impact energies were
5, 15 and 25 GeV. A curve corresponding to eq. 1 was ﬁt to the simulated energy distribu-
tion without the noise term which has not been simulated. The optimal solution, a tungsten
layer thickness of 2.5 mm and a scintillator layer thickness of 3 mm, resulted in the following
expression for the energy resolution:

A parameter for the noise term could not be derived from the simulation but was obtained from
p
an independent investigation of the read-out chip, see [9, 10] and below (Section 2.4).

An equivalent investigation was made in order to determine the optimal width of the scintil-
lator strips. A good spatial resolution is clearly in favour of a small width, but implies a larger
number of read-out channels and a smaller light yield per scintillator, with increased relative
noise contributions. The compromise found was a width of 5 mm resulting in a (one dimen-
sional) spatial resolution of 1.4 mm at 5 GeV. The resolution improves to below 1 mm for higher
energies due to reduced shower ﬂuctuations.

Another important property of any calorimeter is the relation between input energy and
measured response. Deviations from linearity lead to systematic uncertainties and deteriorate
the effective energy resolution. The simulation study on the optimized VLQ calorimeter shows
deviations from linearity below one percent which are a consequence of the compactness of the
calorimeter body and corresponding leakage effects at high energies, see Fig. 4.

Following the simulation results, the calorimeter in its structure as described above repre-
sents an “electromagnetic depth” of 16.7 radiation lengths and has a Moli`ere radius (the radius
of a cylinder containing on the average 90 % of the shower energy) of 1.25 cm.

2.2 Mechanical Layout

The two modules of the calorimeter need to be retracted during the beam ﬁlling phase in order
to protect the silicon tracking device from synchrotron and background radiation. With the help
of the moving mechanics, the radiation load of the VLQ tracking system can be reduced by a

6

factor of more than 20. The moving apparatus delivers a (vertical) position information which
is read out and continuously stored after every move-in / move-out procedure. Its accuracy is of
the same order as that of the tracker, i.e. a few µm.

The VLQ calorimeter modules, including the electronic read-out systems, are accomodated
in a solid brass housing each, with wall thicknesses of 8 mm (side walls), 5 mm (front and back
walls), and 2 mm (bottom wall, i.e. the wall closest to the beam pipe). Thus, sufﬁcient pro-
tection against synchrotron radiation is provided. Inside a module, another 10 mm thick brass
plate is mounted directly above the active volume which accomodates the cooling water tubing
system: The water serves to cool an air stream which continually ﬂows around the electronics
boards. The tracker modules are ﬁxed to the calorimeter modules, as sketched in Fig. 5.

The VLQ spectrometer is situated as close to the beam line as possible in order to catch
electrons and photons scattered or produced at very small angles. This requires a modiﬁcation to
the beam pipe because even a thin but straight cylindrical pipe would force particles to traverse
a large amount of material. The shape of the beam pipe with its changing diameter is shown in
Fig. 6. The pipe is made of aluminium, and the material in front of the VLQ corresponds to
less than one radiation length.

2.3 Light Transport and Collection

After the considerations sketched above, the structure and granularity of the scintillation and
light transport system are ﬁxed: The calorimeter has 24 scintillator layers, 12 vertically and
12 horizontally structured ones. Each vertically structured layer consists of 24 bars, each hor-
izontally structured one consists of 18 bars. An exploded view of the calorimeter structure is
displayed in Fig. 3 . The active, scintillating layers are interleaved with 23 passive, tungsten
layers. The very ﬁrst and very last passive layer are represented by the front and back brass
housing walls.

Each scintillator strip is read out at either side by a wavelength shifter (WLS) bar [11] which
collects and sums the light from 24 strips: In total, there are 2 x (18 + 24) = 84 WLS bars per
module. Each WLS bar is read out by a photodiode at either end so that 168 photodiodes are
needed per module. Each surface plane of a calorimeter module is read out in this manner, so
that four independent transverse shower projections are available.

The wavelength shifters are located close to each other with a distance of only 0.2 mm.
Consequently, the use of a single photodiode with its own housing for an individual WLS is not
possible. Instead, especially manufactured photodiode arrays which match the dimensions of
the WLS arrays were employed 2. There are two kinds of arrays, one with 18 and one with 24
diodes, each implanted in a common p - substrate, corresponding to the transverse structure of
the calorimeter with its two different sets of read-out channels. The size of the active area of
a single diode is 4.2 x 3.4 mm2. The distance between the active areas is 0.8 mm. The diode
arrays are protected by a glass surface of 0.5 mm thickness.

The determination of shower energy and shower position is based on the evaluation of the
transverse shower proﬁles. Any effect which disturbs the primary “physical” proﬁle has to be
avoided or at least minimized. One such effect ist optical cross talk between adjacent scintillator
strips: Scintillation light induced in one channel reaches neighbouring ones and thus distorts the

primary proﬁle. To avoid this, each scintillator strip was wrapped in individually prepared and
cut white paper.

Each scintillator strip matches with either end its WLS bar. Scintillator and WLS have the
same refractive index (n = 1.58) so that an intimate contact would be desirable to minimize light
losses. Since this contact could only be established manually by gluing which inevitably leads
to non-uniform connections, scintillator and WLS were separated by a 0.2 mm wide gap which
is maintained by a Nylon thread. The WLS strips guide the light directly onto the photodiode
surfaces.

Scintillator and WLS materials are selected to match the sensitivity and quantum efﬁciency
of the photodiodes. The scintillator’s wavelength of maximum emission is 425 nm; its light
is shifted by 100 nm towards larger wavelengths (from “blue” to “green”) when re-emitted
by the WLS. The photodiode reaches a modest sensitivity but high quantum efﬁciency at this
wavelength, see Fig. 7.

Finally, the glue between WLS and glass surfaces (n = 1.50) of the photodiodes was chosen
as an Epoxid resin 3 with a refractive index of n = 1.56 which means nearly optimal matching.
Its transparency in the wavelength range of the WLS is larger than 99 %.

The attenuation length of a scintillator slab of dimensions 1 x 20 x 200 cm3 is 210 cm
[7]. This changes drastically for scintillator strips of dimensions used for the VLQ calorimeter,
namely 3 x 5 x 90 (120) mm3. In these very thin strips the number of reﬂections which scin-
tillation light undergoes, and consequently the net light loss, is much larger. A measurement
of the attenuation [12] results in a parametrization by a sum of two exponential functions: The
region close to the exit surface is governed by a very small attenuation length of 2.7 mm, the
region towards the scintillator centre is described by an attenuation length of 101 mm.

The efﬁciency of light transmission from scintillators to wavelength shifters is between 80
% and 90 %, the light collection efﬁciency of the WLS is about 50 % [9]. In total, a fraction of
5 - 10 % of the light induced by an electromagnetic shower is collected onto the photodiodes.

2.4 Electronic Read-out

The read-out via photodiodes requires an electronic ampliﬁcation of the diode signals. An
energy deposition of 5 GeV in the calorimeter liberates roughly 55000 electrons in the pho-
todiodes. Since these photoelectrons are generally distributed over several detecting diodes, a
charge corresponding to 1000 electrons has to be measured well above noise. This condition
imposes demanding requirements on the read-out circuit, especially in terms of electronic noise.
The terminal capacitance of a single diode in the array is 10 pF when operated at a bias voltage
of 70 V.

The read-out of the photodiodes is performed via charge sensitive preampliﬁers realized as
full custom Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs), for reasons of compactness and
power consumption. The preampliﬁer chips are mounted with Chip On Board (COB) Tech-
nology, on the front and back printed circuit boards (PCB) of the calorimeter structure directly
behind the photodiodes, in order to avoid additional capacitive loading of the preampliﬁer inputs
through connecting wires. The ampliﬁed diode signals are brought to a top PCB where sum-
ming ampliﬁers and differential line drivers are located. The preampliﬁer chip was speciﬁcally

10

designed and produced in the Austria Micro Systems (AMS) 1.2 µm CMOS process. It features
six preampliﬁer channels with subsequent shaping, fast trigger summing (see Section 2.5) and
an on-chip charge calibration system. The rise time of the preampliﬁer output is 30 ns followed
by a 200 ns shaping. Principally, the noise goes down with increasing shaping time. On the
other hand, the probability of overlapping events increases due to the HERA bunch crossing
distance of only 96 ns. A shaping time of 200 ns was chosen as a compromise. The read-out
chain and the scheme of the read-out chip circuit are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.

With the photodiodes used here, this corresponds to an effective noise ﬁgure of 416 electrons
r.m.s. With an estimated signal of 11 000 electrons for a 1 GeV electron shower out of which
75 % are deposited in a core seen by two horizontal and two vertical scintillator bars with front
and back read-out, a calibrated noise ﬁgure of 120 MeV is anticipated.

After shaping, the two signals from either end of one WLS bar are summed and sent, through
a 30 m long cable, differentially to the analogue receivers located in the electronics hut of the
H1 experiment This system is identical to that one operated in the read-out of the H1 backward
calorimeter BEMC [13]. The read-out and ampliﬁcation electronics, including the line driver,
are located inside the VLQ calorimeter housing. The total power consumption of 25 W is
mainly due to the line drivers, and requires water cooling of the read-out electronics.

The calorimeter signals are re-transformed into unipolar signals by a differential receiver.
The signal is delayed by 2.2 µs with the help of an adjustable analogue delay line. This time is
needed to store the signals until the ﬁrst level trigger of the H1 detector has made a decision.
The signals from this analog pipeline are ampliﬁed once more and, in case of a positive trigger
decision, stored in a Sample-and-Hold circuit as analog voltages. The Sample-and-Hold circuit
stores the voltage at exactly that time when the trigger signal arrives. This requires a precise
timing of the calorimeter signals whose maxima are to be stored upon trigger signal arrival.

One analog receiving card accomodates 16 equally built channels. The voltages stored in
these 16 Sample-and-Hold circuits are, after trigger decision, transferred via a multiplexer to
the H1 standard calorimeter read-out system [14] where signals are digitized in a 12 bit ADC 4,

4Analogue-to Digital Converter

12

and stored. In this way, the 84 signal and 4 trigger channels of a calorimeter module are read
out. The trigger channels are also fed into the analog read-out in order to perform trigger control
measurements.

2.5 The Calorimeter Trigger

The VLQ spectrometer is devoted to new physics regimes where high energetic particles are
scattered through small angles into the backward region of H1, i.e. the region downstream the
electron beam. The VLQ becomes therefore an important and independent element of the H1
trigger system.

A VLQ calorimeter trigger signal can carry information on energy deposited, above a certain
threshold, in a certain section of the calorimeter. A maximum number of four trigger signals
per module is possible as dictated by the resources of the H1 Central Trigger Logics (CTL).
The signal has to be derived from the (2 x 18) + (2 x 24) read-out channels available. The most
simple conceivable trigger signal would be just the sum of the signals of all read-out channels.
This straight - forward solution has two drawbacks: First, since an electromagnetic shower
distributes its energy over few channels only, signals are added from calorimeter regions “far
away” from the shower, thus adding just noise to the sum signal. Second, a rather frequently
occurring background effect known as “Single Diode Effect” (or “Nuclear Counter Effect”)
would not be suppressed in such a simple scheme.

The calorimeter noise can be separated into two classes: Coherent and incoherent noise.
The former is due to signals, e.g. out of the electronic environment, which are picked up by all
calorimeter channels simultaneously. They will lower or raise the original signals by roughly
the same amount. Incoherent noise is individual (e.g. statistically generated) activity, with a
Gaussian amplitude spectrum centered at zero whose spread is supposed to be reduced when
summed over. The contribution from coherent noise is proportional to the number of noisy
channels, the contribution from incoherent noise to its square root. To minimize the noise
contribution, in particular from coherent noise, the number of channels to be summed up to
yield a signal must be kept as small as possible.

The “Single Diode” (SD) effect is generated by particles passing through the depletion layer

of a diode and leaving an amount of energy which mimics a high energy shower signal.

The suppression of both coherent noise and SD effect require a more segmented trigger
scheme because the “total sum” solution would lead to an intolerable trigger threshold be-
haviour, and suppression of SD events needs comparison of channels opposite to each other.
Therefore, in a ﬁrst step only calorimeter signals from horizontal scintillator bars, read out at
the vertical sides, are used for triggering. They suffer less strongly from the SD effect because
the calorimeter regions close to the beam line, and thus the corresponding horizontal photodiode
arrays, are much more frequently hit by scattered electrons due to their 1/Q4 (i.e. Rutherford)
angular distribution.

In a second step, the calorimeter module is logically divided into trigger segments. Verti-
cally, two windows are constructed of nine channels each, with an overlap of six channels. The
overlap region is chosen large enough to cover a complete shower which deposits nearly all its

13

energy in one central plus two left and two right neighbouring channels. The trigger efﬁciency
is thus not reduced for particles impinging close to the edge of a window. The trigger pattern is
shown in Fig. 11.

Each vertical window is read out at either side so that “left signal” and “right signal” can be
compared. As the light attenuation in the scintillator strips is weak, a real shower should lead to
roughly equal signals at either side, while SD events do not, and thus can easily be recognized
at the trigger level.

The outmost six channels (which point towards the main detector) are not included in the
trigger because they are hidden in the shadow of the SpaCal insert [2] which was supposed to be
modiﬁed in a later upgrade step. The trigger scheme is, as is the read-out scheme, symmetrical
for both modules. In summary, four analog trigger signals per module, or eight signals for the
entire spectrometer, are available.

The analog trigger signals are delivered to the trigger module which prepares the digital
trigger information. First, the analog signals from opposite sides of a window are added in
In addition, thresholds are applied
order to avoid inhomogeneities in the trigger efﬁciency.
to the eight original sums yielding the signals N1 to N8; these (low) thresholds are labelled
“noise triggers”. Furthermore, two independent (“low” and “high”) thresholds are applied to
the newly built sums, yielding another eight digital signals (L1+3 to L6+8, H1+3 to H6+8).
These digital signals are synchronized with the HERA clock on the trigger module. The 16
digital signals generated on the trigger module are fed into a general purpose digital input -
output card. It accomodates a freely programmable look-up table which combines the input
signals to the eight VLQ trigger elements delivered to the Central Trigger Logics of H1. All
thresholds in the trigger module can be adjusted individually.

Finally, there are eight VLQ - derived trigger elements, four derived from the top module,
and four derived from the bottom module. For symmetry reasons, only the four top - derived
elements are explained here:

“VLQ-top-low” = (L1+3) OR (L2+4)
“VLQ-top-high” = (H1+3) OR (H2+4)
“VLQ-top-SDE”, a trigger element which signals the presence of asymmetric energy deposi-
tion, i.e. a so called “single diode” event.

14

The corresponding thresholds (“noise”, “low”, “high”) are roughly 3.5 GeV, 7.0 GeV, and 10.0
GeV, respectively. The VLQ - derived trigger elements are combined with each other, and
trigger elements from other H1 subdetectors, in the Central Trigger Logic.

3 The Cluster Reconstruction Algorithm

In order to reconstruct physical quantities from calorimeter data, an energy correction and clus-
ter ﬁnding algorithm to evaluate the raw data has been developed. The calorimeter raw data
consists of the digitized signal amplitudes measured in each of the 168 calorimeter channels
and stored in units of ADC counts. In addition the amplitudes of the eight trigger summing
channels are recorded.

The reconstruction is subdivided into two separate software modules which are executed
sequentially. The ﬁrst module performs operations upon individiual channels, such as the trans-
formation of ADC counts into energies in GeV, while the second module locates compound
objects, the “clusters”, which are constructed from logically connected channels. Since the
VLQ calorimeter is part of the H1 four-level triggering system, the reconstruction is developed
such that the algorithms can be executed at the fourth trigger level, a multi-processor computing
farm. This restricts the complexity of the algorithms to be run and the size of the reconstruction
software because only a limited amount of time to evaluate the event is available, and constraints
upon the hardware resources exist.

The ﬁrst step in the reconstruction process is unpacking of the bitwise packed calorime-
ter raw data. One raw data word contains the channel energy and the corresponding channel
identiﬁer. After unpacking, the pedestal for each channel, obtained as the average from an of-
ﬂine random trigger data set and stored in an online-accessible data base, is subtracted from
the read out signal. The individual channel-to-channel alignment constants, also determined in
an ofﬂine calibration as described in Section 5, are applied. Thereafter the second module, the
cluster construction, is executed. In order to be able to reconstruct clusters, potential “single
diode” channels (SDs, see Section 2.5) have to be removed. A display with the four projections
of a typical single diode event is shown in Fig. 12.

In view of the projective read out of the VLQ calorimeter, the removal of SD channels is a
straight-forward task. Both the horizontal and the vertical scintillator strips are read out at
either end. Thus there are two independent energy measurements of each projection, and one
can compare the two signal amplitudes from the two ends of a scintillator bar. If the energy in
one channel is signiﬁcantly larger than that in the corresponding opposite one, the channel is
treated as a single diode one, and its energy is set to zero.

However, the situation is generally a bit more complicated because a “single diode” and
a “real”, i.e. scintillator light induced, event might overlap. Therefore the two neighbouring
channels of the suspected SD channel are checked if their amplitudes exceed a certain level
above noise. If this is not the case, the central channel is treated as an SD channel and its energy
is reset to zero. If the amplitudes are well above noise, they are averaged, and the mean value is
assigned to the central channel. This procedure cannot be applied, however, if the single diode

15

candidate is close to one of the calorimeter edges. In this case its amplitude is replaced with that
of its opposite partner. SD channels are detected in roughly 25 to 30 % of all events, depending
on the running conditions.

After the check for and removal of SDCs, a two step cluster construction is performed.
The ﬁrst step aims at ﬁnding “pre-clusters” independently in each of the four projections. To
recognize a pre-cluster, the prescriptions of simple calculus to ﬁnd minima and maxima of
an analytic function are applied and transposed in order to handle discrete values as those of
calorimeter channel amplitudes. The ﬁrst and second derivatives are approximated as

the derivatives, a three σ noise cut is applied on the individual channels. This reduces the
building of noise clusters due to random ﬂuctuations in the amplitude distribution.

−

After calculating the derivatives, the channels with minima and maxima in the amplitude dis-
tribution are ﬂagged. This is done for each of the four projections independently without using
any knowledge from the other projections. The projective readout is then used to cross-check
the results by using information from the opposite projection. The numbers of minima and
maxima found are compared for each corresponding projection. In the case the numbers do not
match, the region in the projection where an extremum was expected, but none was found, is
re-examined. This case is quite frequent and is not due to a malfunction of the algorithm, but
rather due to scintillator attenuation and cut-off effects. In this step, the noise cut is no longer
applied, and the pre-cluster is veriﬁed if the channels around the maximum contain at least 40 %
of the maximum amplitude. In this case a pre-cluster will be constructed in the projection where
previously none was found. To achieve consistency in the number of pre-clusters found in cor-
responding projections is important because in the ﬁnal clustering procedure the pre-clusters

16

are combined to form ﬁnal clusters. In order to verify a cluster, all four projections must match
and are needed to reconstruct both x- and y- coordinates.

The situation is somewhat more complicated if two or more particles enter the calorimeter
volume. In the case of two clusters (the rare case of three or more clusters can be neglected),
there are two possible conﬁgurations: The clusters are aligned in either x
direction, or
they are distinct. In both cases a pre-cluster construction algorithm is applied analogous to the
one - cluster case, with a few assumptions in order to deﬁne a cluster separation criterion [15],
so that channel energies can be properly assigned to clusters.

As soon as pre-clusters are identiﬁed and their energies determined, the energy-weighted
coordinates of pre-cluster cells in all four projections are used to calculate the coordinates of the
cluster centre of gravity. Following experience with the large backward calorimeter SpaCal [2],
a logarithmic weighting procedure is applied. The individual weights of contributing channels
i are determined as

W0 is a dimensionless cut-off parameter based on assumptions on the the shower proﬁle [9].

where N is the number of channels associated with the clusters, xcl the cluster center of gravity,

After reconstructing the pre-clusters in the four projections, the ﬁnal (full) cluster properties
are determined by adding the pre-cluster energies and averaging the coordinates of the pre-
cluster centres.

In case of more than one cluster per projection the situation is more difﬁcult, as illustrated

in ﬁgure 13:

Two particles hitting the calorimeter lead to eight pre-clusters from which four clusters can
be reconstructed so that there is no unique solution. If however the two incident particles deposit
clearly different amounts of energy in the calorimeter, combining the low energy pre-clusters
versus the high energy ones allows a non-ambiguous solution. This method will of course fail if
the particles have similar energies. In this case no unique solution is possible, and the decision
needs to be left over to the VLQ track detector [6].

4 The Calibration Concept

4.1 Test Beam Calibration

Both VLQ calorimeter modules were tested in an electron test beam at the Deutsches Elektronen
- Synchrotron DESY in Hamburg. The beam, supplied by the DESY synchrotron, had energies
adjustable between 1 and 6 GeV.

In the test setup, the VLQ module to be investigated was ﬁxed at the moving mechanism
constructed for operation in H1. As this device supplies only vertical movement, horizontal
displacements were performed on a support table driven by a step motor. The vertical and
horizontal displacement steps were 5 mm each, corresponding to the scintillator strip width.

The distance between beam collimator and calorimeter module was 5.70 m. The position
of the beam in a vertical plane in front of the calorimeter was deﬁned with the help of a silicon
tracker telescope. The telescope consisted of two densely packed bundles, each equipped with
four Si strip detector planes. The strip orientations were y - x - y - x - x - y - x - y. Each plane
contained 384 Si strips of 50 µm width. The distance between the layers inside one bundle was
10 mm, the two bundles were 17 cm apart from each other. The cross section covered by the
telescope was 2 x 2 cm2. The Si - telecope was read out sequentially by a 6 - bit CAMAC ADC.
It was sandwiched between two scintillation counters which, in coincidence with the telescope
signals, provided a trigger pulse. The read-out chain for the VLQ calorimeter modules was
identical to that one used in H1 with the exception that the synchronization between test beam
generated events and the HERA clock which controlls the readout had to be imposed artiﬁcially
[9].

Fig. 14 shows a test beam event as a fourfold projection of the energy deposition in the
calorimeter. Each of the four histograms displays the (pedestal corrected) contents of the corre-
sponding ADC channels. To determine the shower energy, the entries of the ADC channels of
all four histograms have to be summed up.

18

Figure 14: Energy deposit of a 6 GeV electron in the VLQ calorimeter, recorded in
a test beam.

In an ideal homogeneous sampling calorimeter of inﬁnite depth, the output signal is pro-
portional to the incident and completely absorbed energy. The proportionality factor which
converts ADC counts into energy is called calibration constant.

A real calorimeter is neither perfectly homogeneous nor inﬁnitely deep. The response will
depend on the impact position of the primary particle which, together with unavoidable leakage
effects, deteriorates the energy (and spatial) resolution. Calibration has therefore a twofold
purpose: In a ﬁrst step, the response of different channels to identical energies must be equalized
(“intercalibration”), and in the second step the conversion factor to obtain absolute energies
must be determined.

Intercalibration is performed through two independent spatial scans, one along the horizon-
tal side of the calorimeter module, and one along the vertical one. Channel-to-channel responses
vary due to inhomogeneities which are mainly caused by imperfect light connections. After a
ﬁrst go-through, the individual single channel responses can be pre-equalized by appropriate
weights. In the subsequent step, the spread of output signals will be reduced but still be present,
mainly due to light cross talk at the WLS - photodiode connections. Therefore the procedure
is repeated until a convergence criterion is fulﬁlled. In the end, after application of the overall

19

calibration constant to convert Volts into GeV, the individual calibration factors determined for
one module have a mean close to one and an r.m.s. of about 10 %, see Fig. 15.

As mentioned above, the scintillator strips of the VLQ calorimeter show an absorption
length much smaller than the corresponding bulk material. This affects the energy reconstruc-
tion and requires correction. The light attenuation process was quantiﬁed through a test series
where the beam impact was varied along a horizontal (vertical) layer of strips, and the corre-
sponding vertical (horizontal) WLS array was read out. The results are shown in Fig. 16 a and
b, and where the ADC signal height is plotted as a function of the number of the vertical (a) and
horizontal (b) strip hit.

Apparently, the extinction curve shows two components and can be ﬁt, up to the penultimate

point, by the sum of two exponentials:

where d denotes the horizontal or vertical distance between beam impact point and light con-
nection, respectively. The reduced light yield from the last strip hit is due to shower particle
losses at the calorimeter edge. The enhanced light yield close to the connection scintillator
- WLS is caused by its geometry which allows for a wider emission angle at this junction.

After an energy scan, the linearity behaviour of the calorimeter can be studied in the avail-
able energy range from 1 to 6 GeV. The result is displayed in Fig. 17 which shows the relative
deviation from linearity. Deviations are below 1 % and consistent with the simulation results
(cf. Fig. 4).

This is marginally consistent with the simulation result of eq. 2; differences are due to the
limited (low) energy range covered by the test beam and its impurities, e.g. due to secondary
scattering processes, which tend to distort the energy measurements [9].

The reconstruction of cluster spatial coordinates is also based on the energy measurement:
The shower centre of gravity in either projection is expressed as energy weighted mean of
scintillator strip coordinates which by construction have a digitization of 5 mm. For consistency,
the same ﬁve channels are used for spatial reconstruction as for shower energy reconstruction.

The spatial resolution of the calorimeter is determined by comparing the reconstructed beam
impact position (according to the procedure described above) and the impact position deﬁned
with the help of the silicon tracker matrix whose resolution is roughly 0.1 mm. The result for a
beam energy of 4 GeV, for either calorimeter projection, is about 1 mm. The resolution for the
horizontal (x -) coordinate is shown in Fig. 18. When parametrizing the spatial resolution as a
function of energy, a ﬁt of the form

The projective read-out structure of the calorimeter ﬁnally allows for a direct sampling of the
lateral shower proﬁle. This is performed by measuring a large number of showers in the central
area of a calorimeter module, at an energy of 4 GeV. In a large number of measurements, noise
and statistical ﬂuctuations in the shower proﬁle cancel. The bin size is given by the resolution
(about 1 mm). In Fig. 19 all shower proﬁles are plotted versus the radial distance from the
shower axis such that each shower centre is shifted to R = 0. One recognizes a two - component
structure of the proﬁle which can be parametrized as the sum of two exponentials. A ﬁt to the

4.2 Normal Calibration Using the “Kinematical Peak”

In order to calibrate the VLQ calorimeter during the standard experimental data taking phase
and at high energies, the observation of the “kinematical peak” in electron - proton scattering is
exploited: In the energy spectrum of electrons scattered off protons with moderate Q2, a peak
appears at the position of the incident electron beam energy. The response of a calorimeter can
be adjusted accordingly.

The calibration proceeds in several steps: After selecting the kinematical peak events, a
channel-to-channel intercalibration is performed in order to homogenize channel responses.
This is followed by adjusting the absolute energy scale in terms of position dependent calibra-
tion factors.

4.2.1 Event Selection and Channel-to-Channel Intercalibration

Figure 20: Projected views of a “Kinematical Peak” event.

Events to be used for the kinematical peak calibration must fulﬁl the following selection
criteria: The electron must deposit an energy above the highest trigger threshold in one of the
calorimeter modules; the value of the “inelasticity” y reconstructed following the prescription
by Jacquet and Blondel [16] which indicates hadronic energy deposition in the central calorime-
0.04; as at HERA the electron beam energy is 27.56 GeV, only clusters
ter must obey yJB

≤

24

20.0 GeV are accepted. A requirement of the reconstruction software is that
with energies Ecl
exactly one cluster and no SD channel was found, or at least no SD channel which is connected
to the cluster.

≥

The aim of the channel-to-channel intercalibration is to ensure that equal energy depositions
result in equal responses of all channels. Variations in the channel energy responses can have
different sources, the most important ones are due to optical and electronical cross talk. The
optical cross talk is due to light emission into neighbouring photodiodes, caused by overlapping
light cones in the thin glass pane between wavelength shifters and photodiode surfaces.

The channel-to-channel calibration is a two step procedure whose principle has been sketched

in Section 4.1 . The algorithm used for the normal calibration is brieﬂy described below:

In a ﬁrst step the signal of the channel with the maximum energy deposition is ﬁlled into a
histogram associated to that speciﬁc channel, and the mean for each channel is determined. In
order to calculate calibration factors, a reference value is needed which in this case is the “mean
of (the above deﬁned) means”, averaged over all channels belonging to one wavelength shifter
array. This procedure is expressed in the following equation:

M (1) =

i,Ni≥Nlimit m(1)
n(1).

i

P
Here, n(1) is the number of channels entering the average after the ﬁrst iteration, and m(1)
mean value of the histogram which contains the measured energies of channel i.

i

M (1) is the global mean in an given wavelength shifter array for the ﬁrst iteration. The effect

of the calibration is such that after applying the ﬁrst iteration calibration constants

(9)

is the

(10)

f (1)

M (1)
m(1)
i

.

the mean energy in any channel is shifted to the global mean. This procedure is then repeated
until the change in the mean energy of any channel with respect to the previous iteration is
smaller than 0.5%.

The second intercalibration iteration has the purpose to correct for inhomogeneities caused
by optical cross talk between adjacent wavelength shifter bars, which is of the order of 10% [9].
It is performed after the calibration factors of the ﬁrst step have been applied. The procedure is
identical to the previous one with the exception that this time the “maximum channel” energy
plus two “left” and two “right” neighbours are summed up and ﬁlled into the histogram. In this
way, with the iterations carried out as in step one, the “light sharing” between neighbouring
channels due to optical cross talk is taken into account. The distribution of the calibration
factors resulting from this procedure, for the ﬁrst of the two calorimeter modules, is shown in
Fig. 21. The distribution for the second module is similar [15]. The channels with calibration
factors close to 2 suffered from a broken light connection at one end.

4.2.2 Determination of the Absolute Energy Scale and Impact Position Dependent Cali-

bration

The calibration has to result in correction factors which ensure that the energy response for
a given particle energy is the same for all possible impact positions. This was partly done
in the intercalibration steps described above, but due to the light collection effects mentioned
and described in Section 2.3, the regions close to the calorimeter edges are not covered yet.
Therefore in the ﬁnal step of the calibration procedure the absolute energy scale in terms of
position dependent calibration factors is determined.

This correction becomes especially important for impact positions close to the calorime-
ter edges where parts of the deposited energy leak out of the active calorimeter volume into
transverse direction, and where scintillator light yield effects play an important role [12]. Af-
ter homogenizing the individual channel responses, the absolute energy scale and the position
dependend calibration factors are determined.

×

To homogenize the detector response, the detector surface is subdivided into segments of
1 mm2 bins close to the edges where the response
5 mm2 in the central region, and 1
5
depends strongly on the distance from the calorimeter edge. The mean energy ǫij, averaged
over all events reconstructed in that bin, is calculated. The calibration factor Ai,j is calculated
by normalizing the mean energy in the bin ij to the known HERA kinematical peak energy of
27.56 GeV:

The calibration constants have been determined from H1 data for the channels providing sufﬁ-
cient statistics. The mean value of the constants is 1.125 with an r.m.s. spread of 0.040 .

4.2.3 Energy Resolution after Calibration

For the kinematical peak calibration two data samples were used, namely from April 1999 and
from September - October 1999. The energy resolution after calibration, as a function of energy
and from both test beam and kinematical peak data, is displayed in Fig. 22. Using the available
data at lower and high energies, an energy resolution parametrized as

is derived. The individual contributions from sampling term, constant term, and noise term are
indicated in the ﬁgure.

When compared to the parametrization of the resolution curve obtained from test beam data
(Eq. 8), a signiﬁcant increase of the noise term is observed. This is a consequence of the
electronic environment present in the H1 experimental hall which is very much different from
the situation in the test beam area. The additional point taken at the HERA electron beam energy
constrains the ﬁt at high energy so that the constant term can be determined with high accuracy.
No such measurement was available in the test beam. The sampling term is consistent with both
that obtained from a simulation (Eq. 2) and from the low energy test beam data.

5 Performance at HERA

During its two years of operation in the H1 experiment at HERA, the main purpose of the VLQ
spectrometer was the detection of high energy electrons and photons in the context of structure
function measurements [17] and meson spectroscopy. The performance of the calorimeter is
demonstrated best with purely electromagnetic interactions where no other H1 detector com-
ponent is involved, e.g. with wide angle bremsstrahlung events, also called “QED Compton
(QED-C)” events [18], i.e.

e− p

p e− γ.

→

A striking feature of QEDC events is, due to the generally very small four-momentum trans-
fer to the target proton, the coplanarity of the ﬁnal state electron and photon: In the transverse
detector plane (“r - φ - plane”) photon and electron momentum vector components are back -
to - back. In addition, the sum of photon and ﬁnal state electron energy must equal the initial
electron beam energy.

The VLQ calorimeter is ideally suited to test these properties (or, to proﬁt from them because
they can be used for calibration and alignment purposes as described in [18]). The performance
of the calorimeter is demonstrated in Figs. 23 and 24, taken from [18]. Fig. 23 shows the sum

of ﬁnal state electron and photon energies, together with the result of a simulation, and Fig. 24
shows the azimuth angular difference, shifted by 180◦, of photon and electron impact points,
again compared to a simulation. Apparently, the calorimeter behaved as expected.

In the context of an analysis searching for single π0’s produced in the H1 backward region
[5], two - photon pairs were collected and investigated for a signal, where either both photons
had to be detected in the VLQ calorimeter, or one photon in the VLQ and the other one in the
SpaCal backward calorimeter. The low cross section, in combination with special kinematic
restrictions, did not leave a sizeable signal for the VLQ - VLQ case alone.

A clear π0 signal was observed, however, if the combination VLQ - SpaCal is added, see
Fig. 25 where a ﬁt of a Gaussian function to the π0 peak plus a polynomial for the background
is superimposed. The π0 peak is shifted towards a mass larger than the PDG value, and ap-
pears broader than expected for both SpaCal and VLQ mass resolutions [19]. There are several
reasons responsible for these effects: First, the position of the actual interaction vertex is not
known because there are no charged particle tracks in these events, and four-momenta have to
be reconstructed using the nominal vertex position. Second, both the SpaCal and VLQ calibra-
tions were performed with the help of the “Kinematical Peak”, i.e. with electrons of an energy
close to the incident electron beam energy (see Section 4.2) while photons from π0 decays have
much smaller energies. Third, no dedicated intercalibration was performed between the SpaCal
and VLQ calorimeters. In spite of these limitations, the capability of the VLQ to contribute to
the reconstruction of π0’s from their decays to two photons is convincingly demonstrated.

6 Conclusions

The Very Low Q2 calorimeter of H1, a highly compact device designed to measure high ener-
getic electrons and photons in the electron beam downstream region, was succcessfully operated
in the 1999 and 2000 data taking periods. The performance in the experiment was very close
to that expected from design and simulations. The VLQ calorimeter contributed signiﬁcantly to
measurements of the proton structure function F2 in phase space regions previously unaccessi-
ble for H1, and opened a new kinematical regime for the spectroscopy of mesons decaying to
purely photonic ﬁnal states.

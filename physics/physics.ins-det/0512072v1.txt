Cryogenic small-signal conversion with relaxation oscillations in Josephson junctions

Miha Furlan

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Broadband detection of small electronic signals from cryogenic devices, with the option of simple
implementation for multiplexing, is often a highly desired, although non-trivial task. We inves-
tigate and demonstrate a small-signal analog-to-frequency conversion system based on relaxation
oscillations in a single Josephson junction. Operation and stability conditions are derived, with
special emphasis on noise analysis, showing the dominant noise sources to originate from ﬂuctuation
processes in the junction. At optimum conditions the circuit is found to deliver excellent noise
performance over a broad dynamic range. Our simple models successfully apply within the regime
of classical Josephson junction and circuit dynamics, which we conﬁrm by experimental results. A
discussion on possible applications includes a measurement of the response to a cryogenic radiation
detector.

INTRODUCTION

Cryogenic devices are widely used in a broad range of
applications like radiation detection, quantum cryptog-
raphy, charge manipulation on the single-electron level,
quantum Hall eﬀect or in basic studies of mesoscopic
transport. Measurement of the electronic properties of
such devices usually requires sophisticated readout elec-
tronics. Detection schemes where the samples at cryo-
genic temperatures are remotely connected to room tem-
perature electronics generally face the problem of reduced
frequency bandwidth due to the impedance of long read-
out lines.
In addition, the risk of noise pickup on the
lines is intrinsically increased. Alternatively, signal read-
out relatively close to the sample can be accomplished
with SQUID ampliﬁers, which perform very successfully
in many cases but require a delicate setup (shielding)
and are usually constrained to commercially available
systems. Ampliﬁcation or impedance transformation on-
chip or very close to the sample is also possible with a
HEMT, the dissipation of which may, however, quickly
reach an unacceptable level.

In recent years it has been realized that probing the
electronic transport in a cryogenic device with an RF
signal1,2,3,4,5,6 may have considerable advantages com-
pared to direct signal readout, mainly due to a substan-
tial extension of the bandwidth.
In those schemes the
power of the reﬂected (or transmitted) RF signal from
a properly tuned tank circuit is related to the electronic
state of the device under test. The circuit needs to be
carefully designed to minimize back-action on the cryo-
genic sample. Operation at microwave frequencies also
naturally opens a potential way for frequency-domain
multiplexing.7,8

A promising new readout scheme, which we present
in this paper, consists of an on-chip analog-to-frequency
converter, delivering a frequency signal of large ampli-
tude which is easily demodulated with standard room
temperature (phase-locked loop) electronics. It has the
advantages of both the direct signal readout close to the

sample and a large frequency bandwidth. Particularly,
it is much easier to accurately analyze a frequency sig-
nal than to transmit a low-level analog signal through
long readout lines and amplify it with room temperature
equipment which typically shows inferior performance in
terms of noise with increasing temperature. Our low-
noise converter circuit is based on a hysteretic Joseph-
son junction exhibiting relaxation oscillations. Related
ideas using relaxation oscillations in Josephson junc-
tion were proposed for thermometry9 or direct radiation
detection,10 both relying on the temperature dependence
of quasiparticle population in the gap singularity peak
of asymmetric junctions, and for the (double) relaxation
oscillation SQUID,11,12,13 which is investigated and used
as a magnetometer. In our case the circuit converts an
analog current signal into a frequency with acceptable
linearity over a broad operation bias and dynamic range.
In Sec. II we review the basic principle of a relaxation
oscillation circuit and derive conditions for stable opera-
tion. Results from the model are illustrated with experi-
mental data. A thorough noise analysis with implications
for the circuit’s readout resolution is given in Sec. III.
An optimized low-noise conﬁguration with numerical es-
timates is considered in Sec. IV, followed by a discussion
on possible applications in Sec. V. As an example we
demonstrate the readout of a cryogenic radiation detec-
tor. The paper concludes with Sec. VI.

(B) Because the junction was current biased during
phase (A) via a high-impedance L it switches now
to the quasiparticle branch by developing a voltage
across Cj until it is charged to Vg. The inductance
holds the current constant if Cj is small enough,

Neglecting the short voltage switching times of phases
(B) and (D), the relaxation oscillation period is given
by (τA + τC ). However, when biasing a Josephson junc-

In the operation range RsIc < Vs ≤

oscillation frequency (τA + τB )−1 deviates from linear-
ity by less than 10% (a larger operation range can also
be chosen with an easy subsequent linearization of the
results according to circuit calibration). Linear extrapo-
lation of τ −1

Modulation of Ic by application of a magnetic ﬁeld

the relaxation oscillation frequency according to Eq. (6).
This oﬀers a convenient way to tune the circuit’s dynamic
properties as well as to extend the operation range to
lower Ib. Figure 3 shows measurements of fr as a function

Finally, a comparison between (10) and (13) shows that
the latter is the more stringent of both conditions by the
factor βc(4κ/π)2 > 1. Consequently, the very minimum

together with (14) and βc > 1, the relevant conditions for
proper observation of relaxation oscillations and which
should help to choose appropriate circuit components.

A. General

In this section we list the signiﬁcant current noise
sources referred to the circuit input (i.e. at Rb). Spe-
cial attention is paid to experimental mean ﬂuctuations
of the relaxation oscillation periods, which are denoted
by δτr. Assuming an analog signal which requires a band-
width fbw in order to resolve its dynamics in time (i.e.
−1
bw ), we measure N = fr/fbw
a sampling time period f
oscillations per sampled signal. The relative accuracy of
a measurement improves with N as

(15)

Because bias current ﬂuctuations δIb are linear to fre-
quency ﬂuctuations δfr according to Eq. (7), we can also
conclude in ﬁrst order that δτr/τr = δIb/Ib. This yields
an expression for the rms current noise of the signal sam-
pled at fbw:

B. Flicker 1/f noise in the critical current

The critical current of Josephson junctions can ﬂuctu-
ate due to stochastic charge trapping at defect sites in
(or close to) the barrier, which are known as “two-level
ﬂuctuators”. A suﬃciently large ensemble of such ﬂuc-
tuators generates a 1/f spectrum, with signiﬁcant con-
tribution only at low frequencies. According to empirical
models19,20 the critical current noise density jtlf due to
1/f ﬂicker noise can be described by

Escape from the zero-voltage state of a Josephson junc-
tion due to thermal activation is a well-known and widely
studied phenomenon. It can be treated for a large vari-
ety of junction types and external conditions. For our
noise analysis we can restrict ourselves to the simple
“transition-state” model21,22 where a particle inside a
well is thermally excited above the relative barrier poten-
tial and irreversibly leaves the bound state. This model is
appropriate for underdamped Josephson junctions and is
justiﬁed by typical device parameters and experimental
conditions as given in the numerical examples (sections
IV and V). Particularly, we assume intermediate opera-
tion temperatures satisfying

where EJ = ¯hIc/2e denotes a Josephson coupling energy,
suﬃcient to suppress the probability of retrapping from

to prevent macroscopic quantum tunneling eﬀects. Ac-
cording to the model there is a nonvanishing probability
for transitions from the superconducting to the resistive
state at current values Im < Ic. The lifetime of the zero-
voltage state in a Josephson junction as a function of the

To verify our results and to compare with other
models30,31 of diﬀerent formalism or treating diﬀerent
ranges of damping strength, we evaluated numerically
the probabilities P (i), the transition current distribu-
tions p(i) = dP (i)/di, and analyzed them with respect
to shape, expectation value m1 and width σm. We found
that, within the range of allowed and reasonable model
parameters, only the mean values m1 diﬀered quanti-
tatively for diﬀerent models, as should be expected for
diﬀerent initial conditions and excitation forms. How-
ever, there were insigniﬁcant diﬀerences in the distribu-
tion shapes and particularly of their widths σm. There-
fore, Eq. 24 can be considered a good estimate for critical
current ﬂuctuations due to thermally activated escape,
applicable over a wide range of βc > 1.

D. Other noise sources

Thermal current noise from ohmic resistors is domi-
nated by the shunt Rs and corresponds to the standard
Johnson noise j2
s = 4kT /Rs. The voltage noise gener-
Vs,
ated by Rs and seen by the junction is, due to fr ∝
not ampliﬁed and therefore equivalent to js at the circuit
input.

The real part of a good inductance L vanishes. There-
fore, L can safely be considered as a “cold resistor” with-
out thermal noise contribution. Pickup of external mag-
netic noise can be shielded and becomes negligible for
small coils.

Because the Josephson current is a property of the
ground state of the junction, it does not ﬂuctuate. Hence,
shot noise in Josephson junctions is only due to the quasi-
particle current. The relaxation oscillations within our
concept are dominantly determined by processes with the
junction in the superconducting state. Therefore, shot
noise by itself should be negligible in our case.

However, as a consequence of the random nature of
the junction phases in the quasiparticle tunneling regime,
the locking to the zero-voltage state32 at the end of an
oscillation cycle occurs within a time spread13 on the
order of δτz ≈
LCj. This results in an input current

where the constant coeﬃcients ci are orthogonal to the

capacitance Cj in Eq. (28) is implicit by taking the prod-
ucts RnA = ρn and RnCj = ρnǫ0ǫr/d to be constant
in standard Josephson junctions, respectively, where ρn
is the speciﬁc (normal) barrier resistance, ǫr the bar-
rier oxide dielectric constant and d the barrier thickness.
Furthermore, we have neglected the (ln η)1/3 dependence
in Eq. (24) assuming η

the total circuit noise with respect to the parameters in
Eq. (28). In particular, jb appears to decrease with de-

creasing T , α (although satisfying α

contributions. Assuming, for instance, a negligible con-
tribution from the fourth term in (28), a large Rs value

IV. NUMERICAL ESTIMATES

In order to build a relaxation oscillation circuit we are
in principle free to choose any device or circuit compo-
nent and derive the remaining parameters based on opti-
mum arguments as discussed in the previous sections. As
an example we start with a Josephson junction of given
area A, junction (superconducting) material and an op-
eration temperature T . The area determines Rn = ρn/A
1 kΩ µm2 in our standard devices
with a typical ρn ≈
and Cj = ǫ0ǫrA/d with ǫr ≈
2 nm.

The choice of junction material is a choice of energy gaps
∆1, ∆2, determining Vg, I 0
c and EJ . It is worth noting
κIcRn tends to
that, according to Eq. (28), a lower Vg ∝
result in a lower noise level. A lower Vg is also preferable
to exclude perturbations like Fiske modes from the gap
region. However, since Vg delivers the oscillation ampli-
tude, a minimum level is required for proper resolution
of the oscillating signal Vout. This conﬂict can eventually
be alleviated instead by a suppression of I 0
c by the factor
κ due to application of a magnetic ﬁeld, increasing the
oscillation frequency which may be a desired eﬀect. Fi-

FIG. 4: Numerical calculations of Rs, Ib and the diﬀerent
contributions to circuit input current noise as a function of
junction side length s, determined for a conﬁguration as dis-
cussed in the text. The corresponding transition current dis-
tributions p(i) = dP (i)/di due to thermally activated zero-
voltage escape are shown in the bottom graph for diﬀerent
sizes s (identiﬁed by the numbers in units of µm adjacent to
the curves.)

nally, with the choice of operation point α, the required
1 and a minimum L satisfying (13), the
ratio Rs/Rn ≪
full properties of the circuit are determined.

Figure 4 shows a numerical example of a relaxation os-
cillation circuit as a function of junction size (side length
s), assuming an Aluminum junction (∆Al = 170 µV), an
operation temperature T = 100 mK, the ratios Rn/Rs =
103, I 0
c /Ic = 1 and Ib/Ic = 3, and an eﬀective L which is
chosen 10 times larger than the minimum Lmin in (13).
The results in Fig. 4 give an idea of the order of the
parameter ranges, including the contributions from dif-
ferent noise sources. The ﬂicker 1/f noise density (at
fr) was always at least 104 times lower than any other
noise contribution and is therefore not shown in this ex-
ample. The invariant parameters of this conﬁguration
are: fr = 5.23 MHz, ωp = 151 GHz, Vs = 0.80 µV,
10−6, βL = 464.5,
βc = 28.7, βs = βc(Rs/Rn)2 = 28.6

τB = 45.1 ps and RnCj = 35.4 ps.

It is apparent in Fig. 4 that ﬂuctuations due to ther-
mally activated zero-voltage escape (i.e. current noise jm)
are the dominant noise process in the range of small
devices. For illustration the corresponding distribution
functions p(i) = dP (i)/di of transition currents are in-
cluded in Fig. 4. In spite of increasing distribution width
with decreasing junction size s, the noise density de-
creases due to a faster decay of Ib.

As a second numerical example we calculate a realis-
tic minimum-noise circuit conﬁguration without leaving
the range of classical dynamics of Josephson junctions as
assumed for our model. We choose an Al/AlOx/Al junc-
tion where we expect the best quality tunnel barriers and
a suﬃcient oscillation output amplitude Vout
340 µV.
The minimum junction size is restricted by the range of
validity of our model, requiring EJ > EC = e2/2Cj and
EJ > kT to prevent single-electron charging or macro-
scopic quantum tunneling eﬀects, respectively.38 This is
just satisﬁed with a junction of area A = 0.1 µm2
≈
(316 nm)2, which can be fabricated by standard e-beam
lithography. An operation temperature of T = 100 mK is
easily reached and maintained in modern cryostats even
in the case of some moderately low dissipation in the
circuit, namely Pdiss = I 2
b /Rs. The values for the cir-
cuit components follow from our deﬁnitions of α = 3,
Rn/Rs = 100, κ = 1, L/Lmin = 5, and are listed in Ta-
ble I. The results show a total input current noise as
low as about 1 pA/√Hz, with the dominant contribution
from thermally activated zero-voltage escape. Flicker 1/f
noise density at fr is at a negligible level and remains
insigniﬁcant down to very low readout bandwidths fbw.
The total noise ﬁgure of this conﬁguration is well com-
petitive with the best commercial SQUID ampliﬁers. In
addition, due to the advantage of improving noise be-
havior with increasing oscillation frequency, it delivers a
bandwidth superior to most SQUID systems.

It is clear that the operation point for the current or
voltage biased device under test is ﬁxed to Ib or Vs in
this example. For devices requiring diﬀerent bias values
(as in Ref. 33) the circuit components have to be adapted
with respect to the speciﬁcations.

V. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS

We have developed the relaxation oscillation analog-to-
frequency converter primarily for readout of cryogenic ra-
diation detectors.34 The aim was to overcome problems or
limitations in scaling to large number pixel readout. Be-
sides the outstanding noise properties, a particularly nice
feature of the relaxation oscillation circuit is its potential
for simple implementation into a frequency-domain mul-
tiplexing scheme by tuning the oscillation frequencies of
the individual analog-to-frequency converters to well sep-
arated values, and then using one single line to read them
out. It should be taken into account, however, that a sig-
nal excursion from a detector generates a frequency shift,

which should not overlap with a neighboring oscillator in
the simplest case. A more sophisticated scheme could
lock into the “dark” (no detector signal) characteristic
frequencies and, upon disappearance of one channel due
to an analog detector signal, remove the other frequency
bands in order to recover the signal of interest.39

To test and demonstrate the working principle we have
measured the response of a SINIS microcalorimeter35 to
irradiation with 6 keV X-rays, using a relaxation oscil-
lation circuit readout. The detector which replaced Rb
was voltage biased. Figure 5 shows the results of an X-
ray event. The circuit and device parameters were: L =
48 nH, Rs = 91 mΩ, junction size s = 15 µm and eﬀec-
tive critical current Ic = 7.28 µA (κ = 8). The detector’s
“dark” (or bias) current was I 0
b = 17.5µA = 2.4Ic, the
measured analog signal peak current was I 1
b = 46.4µA,
as shown in Fig. 5d. The relaxation oscillation frequen-
cies from Fig. 5c, taken at the same operation point and
conditions, were f 0
r = 12.1 MHz,
respectively. Taking into account the conversion fac-
tor dfr/dIb = 260 kHz/µA, see Eq. (7), the analog and
the frequency-modulated signal are perfectly compatible
quantitatively as well as qualitatively (pulse shape). The
noise level is about the same in both cases and is due
to detector noise. The circuit noise alone is estimated to
contribute about 0.3 µA rms integrated over full band-
width up to fr. We should say that the microcalorimeter
device and circuit conﬁguration are by no means opti-
mal in this example, they are rather a preliminary choice
of available components. Primarily, these results are of
illustrative nature, demonstrating the principle and fea-
sibility of cryogenic detector readout.

r = 4.47 MHz and f 1

Other possible applications for relaxation oscillation
based analog-to-frequency conversion can be, in a wider
sense, considered for any type of cryogenic device oper-
ated at relatively low bias levels, exhibiting small vari-
ations of its electronic properties or actively deliver-
ing small analog signals. A list may include quantum
dots and wires, single-electron devices and quantum Hall
structures, to name a few. Due to the large bandwidth,
the readout method is also attractive for detection of fast
processes like quantum noise or background charge ﬂuc-
tuations. The resistors Rb and Rs in our scheme just
represent a current and a voltage source, respectively,
and can be replaced by the device of choice.

It is important to note, however, that the oscillator
junction characteristics (essentially represented by Ic)

e.g. by metrologists.

As a concluding experiment we propose a setup for
high-precision thermometry at low temperatures, replac-
ing the classical four-point measurement on thermistors.
The temperature-sensitive element would typically re-
place Rs to minimize dissipation. The diﬃculty of ap-
plying small analog excitations and detecting low output
levels (across long wires), competing with noise, is cir-
cumvented by directly “digitizing” the small signal very
close to the sensor with a low-noise converter. It is clear
that this thermometer readout can only be operated in
a limited temperature range (presumably one order of
magnitude) where the junction dynamics (ﬂuctuations,
switching probabilities) are suﬃciently insensitive to T
variations.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the feasibility of a cryogenic low-
noise analog-to-frequency converter with acceptable lin-
earity over a broad range of circuit and operation param-
eters. The dynamical behavior can be well described by
simple circuit theory and classical models of the single
Josephson junction involved. Their agreement with ex-
perimental data is perfect. We have presented a thorough
analysis of noise sources, where ﬂuctuation processes in
the Josephson junction appear to usually dominate the
circuit’s noise ﬁgure for typical conﬁgurations and exper-
imental conditions. The inherent broadband operation
paired with very good noise performance oﬀers a ver-
satile system for a wide range of applications. As one
possible example we have demonstrated the readout of
a cryogenic microcalorimeter exposed to X-rays. Imple-
mentation into a multiplexing scheme was discussed and
needs to be experimentally tested for a large channel-
number readout.

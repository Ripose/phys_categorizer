purity monitor based on an α-source

Abstract

A novel liquid argon (LAr) purity monitor was developed with a sensitivity to elec-
tronegative impurities of the order of ppb (O2 equivalent). Such a high purity is e.g.
needed in a LAr drift chamber. The principle is to measure the lifetime of quasifree
electrons in LAr, since this is the important parameter for the operation of a drift
chamber. Free electrons are produced by ionizing the LAr with α-particles emitted
by the 210P o chain daughter of an isotope 210P b source. From a measurement of the
charge of the electron cloud at the beginning and at the end of a drift path, together
with the drift time, the lifetime of the electrons is obtained. The α-particles have
a very short range of about 50 µm in LAr and the ionization density is very high,
typically between 750 ÷ 1500 MeV/cm, leading to a high recombination rate. To
suppress the recombination of the argon ions with the electrons, the α-source was
put in a strong electric ﬁeld of 40 ÷ 150 kV/cm. This was achieved by depositing
the source on the surface of a spherical high voltage cathode with a diameter of
about 0.5 mm. The anode was also made as a sphere of about the same diameter
as the cathode, thus, close to the axis between the two electrodes the electric drift
ﬁeld was approximately a dipole ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

Liquid argon (LAr) detectors need to monitor the purity of the LAr since elec-
tronegative impurities (mainly O2) capture ionization electrons, and hence de-
grade the performance of the detector. Diﬀerent types of liquid argon purity
monitors were developed for the LAr detectors in use or for future experi-
ments. For the LAr calorimeters in the H1 [1] and the Atlas [2] experiments
the necessary sensitivity of the monitors to electronegative impurities is of

the order of ppm (oxygen equivalent). The pulse height spectra from β-decay
electrons and α-particles are measured in a LAr ionization chamber. In the
drift chamber of the ICARUS detector [3] drift times of the order of ms occur.
In order to measure such long drift times, it is necessary to purify the LAr
from to a level below 0.3 ppb (oxygen equivalent). Purity monitors with this
sensitivity were built [4], measuring the lifetime of electrons which drift in a
homogeneous electric ﬁeld over a distance of about 10 cm. The drift electrons
were extracted using an appropriately chosen photocathode, which is ﬂashed
periodically with a bright light pulse.

Traditionally the problems encountered in designing purity monitors were (1)
related to the creation of a suﬃciently large drift electron cloud in order to
produce clean signals above noise and (2) to the extraction of the purity with
high precision and sensitivity.

The purity monitor described in this paper is also based on a lifetime measure-
ment of electrons. The method to determine the lifetime of electrons consists
of measuring the attenuation of the charge of an electron cloud drifting in an
electric ﬁeld as a function of the drift time. The mean lifetime of the electrons
is obtained from equation (1):

N(tdrif t) = N0 · exp (−tdrif t/τ ),

(1)

where N0 is the number of electrons at the beginning and N(tdrif t) the number
of electrons at the end of the drift path corresponding to a drift time tdrif t.

However, our purity monitor includes the following new features:

• a new almost monochromatic source of free electrons based on an energetic

5.3 MeV α-source;

• a dipole geometry to introduce a very high ﬁeld in the region of the cathode
and anode, and a very low ﬁeld in the drift region in-between (inhomoge-
neous ﬁeld);

• a direct start and stop trigger for a source-event from the independent

readout of the cathode and anode induced signals;

• a built-in variation of the drift time, due to the diﬀerent path along the
dipole ﬁeld lines introducing a spread-in-time for the arrival of the electron
cloud on the anode;

• an event-by-event measurement of the drift time and induced charges be-
fore the drift at the cathode and after the drift at the anode, yielding the
attentuation as a function of the event-by-event varying drift-time.

2 The purity monitor

The purity monitor described in this paper is shown schematically in Figure 1;
it uses the ionization electrons produced by the 5.3 MeV α-particles emitted
by 210P o to measure the electron lifetime. The α-emitter 210P o is produced
with a decay fraction of almost 100% through β-decays in the decay chain of
210P b →210 Bi →210 P o. The decay chain ends at the stable 206P b isotope. In
the decay chain of 210P b several α- and β-decays occur, but only the β-decay
of 210Bi with an endpoint energy of 1.2 MeV and the α-decay of 210P o with an
energy of 5.3 MeV have decay probabilities of almost 100%, all other decays
are very rare.

The high ionization density of α-particles in LAr, typically between 750 ÷
1500 MeV/cm as opposed to about 2 MeV/cm for a m.i.p., leads to an ex-
tremely high recombination rate [5] of the argon ions with the electrons along
the track of the α-particles, thus, reducing the measurable electron charge [6].
The recombination rate is reduced, when the ionization occurs in a strong
electric ﬁeld [7]. At a typical drift ﬁeld of 500 V/cm, less than 1% is recovered
as free electrons. To expose the α source to the mandatory electric ﬁelds of
the order of 40 ÷ 150 kV/cm, it was deposited onto the surface of a spherical
platinum high voltage cathode with a diameter of about 0.5 mm; applying a
high voltage of 2 kV produces an electric ﬁeld E ≈ V /r, where r is the radius
of the sphere, of about 80 kV/cm at the surface. The spherical electrodes were
made from a 76 µm thick platinum wire by melting one end of the wire in
a ﬂame of a Bunsen burner [6]; the surface tension of the melting platinum

was forming spherical drops. The 20 kBq 210P b-source 1 with a mean lifetime
of 31.9 years was dissolved in a 1.2 molar HNO3-solution. A thin layer with
an activity of about 100 Bq was deposited electrolytically on the spherical
cathode. Figure 2 shows an electron microscope picture of a cathode, having
a thin layer of 210P b deposited on the surface; the diameter of the electrode is
458 ±12 µm.

The anode also consists of a Pt sphere with a diameter of 335 ±7 µm. A
symmetrical high voltage ±HV applied to the two electrodes produces ap-
proximately an electric dipole drift ﬁeld. The electric drift ﬁeld on the axis
between the electrodes is shown in Figure 3 for a high voltage of 1.5 kV.

The number of free ionization electrons remaining after recombination depends
on the electric ﬁeld along the entire track of the α-particle, i.e., it depends on
the high voltage applied to the cathode and its diameter. The range of the
5.3 MeV α-particles in LAr is only about 50 µm, i.e., 1/5 of the used cathode

radius. Thus, the electric ﬁeld along the entire track of the α-particle can (in
the worst case) decrease by only 33% from the value at the cathode surface.
The number N0 of electron-ion pairs produced by α-particles depositing their
total energy of 5.3 MeV in LAr is N0 = 5.3 · 106eV /w = 225 · 103, where
w = 23.6 eV is the mean energy needed to create an electron-ion pair in LAr.
We stress that this number is reduced if the alpha deposits a non-negligible
fraction of its energy in the lead (the range in lead is 16 µm). Neglecting
this eﬀect, we anticipate here (see section 3.2 for more details) that the mea-
sured quenching of this charge by the recombination (recombination factor R)
varied between 0.22 at a ﬁeld on the cathode surface of 44 kV/cm to 0.39
at 154 kV/cm (see Figure 8), a variation consistent with the Box model of
recombination.

The charge of the electron cloud at the cathode and the anode is obtained
by integrating the current signals induced on the electrodes by the movement
of the electrons in the drift ﬁeld. The fast movement in the high ﬁeld near
the surface of the electrodes induces a fast rising current signal (see Figure 6)

with a good signal to noise ratio. The argon ions have drift velocities orders
of magnitude smaller than the electrons so that they do not contribute to
the current signal. To summarize, the conﬁguration of Figure 1 combines the
following desirable features:

• the high electric ﬁeld on the cathode surface containing the α source sup-

presses the recombination,

• the fast drift velocity of the electrons in the high electric ﬁeld near the
surface of the electrodes induces a short (approx. 1 µs) current pulse, which
can be measured.

• the small drift velocity of the electrons in the central region of the dipole
ﬁeld (minimal ﬁeld strength is a few V/cm) allows to measure long drift
times.

Fig. 5. Measuring set-up.

The mechanical design of the purity monitor is shown in Figure 4. Two circular
polyethylene plates with the electrodes in the center are held by three Macor
rods. The monitor is shielded by a stainless steel cylinder and covered at the
bottom and at the top with steel plates. The distance between the electrodes
was varied between 20 mm and 50 mm. The measuring set-up is shown in
Figure 5.

A glass dewar holding the purity monitor was mounted in a vacuum chamber.
Before ﬁlling the dewar with LAr, the chamber was heated to about 70◦C
for at least one day and pumped to a pressure of about 10−6 mbar. The LAr
passed through a 5 ℓ puriﬁcation cartridge containing 50% BTS 2 catalyst and
50% copper oxide. The BTS and the copper oxide were reduced by controlled
ﬂowing of hydrogen gas through the cartridge before it could be used to purify
LAr from oxygen.

The readout electronics for the two electrodes is operated at room temperature
outside the vacuum chamber. It consists of a low noise charge preampliﬁer of
the type used for the ICARUS drift chamber [10] followed by a custom-made
ac-coupled ampliﬁer, which also acts as a bandpass ﬁlter transmitting fre-
quencies from 530 Hz to 760 kHz (-3 dB values). The preampliﬁer integrates
the current pulse from the electrode; its decay constant is about 250 µs. The
circuit has an overall sensitivity of 10.8 mV/ke− corresponding to 68 mV/fC.
Both electrodes have their own readout channels, which were carefully cali-
brated. The analog signals were sampled with 10 MHz and digitized by a 12
bit ADC card in a PC; the digital data were accumulated with a LabView
program.

3 Results

3.1 Signal shapes

Figure 6 shows the measured pulse shapes from the cathode and the anode at
a high voltage of ±1.5 kV and an electrode distance of 20 mm. The integrated
current (i.e. the charge) induced on the electrodes by the moving electron cloud
is shown as a function of time. The fast rising leading edge of the signals
is induced by the fast movement of the electrons in the high ﬁeld near the
surface of the electrodes. The decay of the signal is given by the decay time of
the integrating electronics. In the anode signal the contribution to the signal
over the whole drift time is seen: it starts with the fast movement of the
electron cloud near the cathode, gets ﬂat during the time of the slow drift
through the central region of the drift ﬁeld and rises sharply when the cloud
reaches the anode. In the cathode signal the contribution from the drift in
the low ﬁeld region is hidden in the rounding of the signal after the sharp
rise. The charge is given by the pulse height diﬀerence between the maximum
(minimum) and the base line deﬁned by the (average) signal measured at times
before the cathode pulse starts. Figure 7 shows the pulse height spectra from
the cathode and the anode measured at three diﬀerent high voltages and at a

separated form noise and the small pulses from β-decays (β-decay electrons
have a maximal range in LAr of 3 mm, compared to 50 µm for α-particles,
and hence, have a diﬀerent distribution of induced signals between cathode
and anode). The energy deposited by the α-particles in LAr is reduced from
the maximal energy of 5.3 MeV and smeared out by the energy deposition
in the lead of the source (the range in lead is 16 µm). The maximal charge
(for a ﬁxed high voltage) is given by the end point of a pulse height spectrum
and corresponds to the deposition of the total energy of 5.3 MeV in the LAr.
The values for the maximal and the mean (corresponding to the peak of the
distribution) measured charge are given in Table 1.

3.2 E-ﬁeld dependence

In order to study the recombination of the electron-ion pairs produced by
α’s as a function of the electric ﬁeld, we consider the maximal charge (i.e.

we try to suppress the uncertainties related to the energy loss of the α’s in
the source Pb before they enter the liquid Argon medium 3 . In Figure 8 the
maximum measured charged is plotted as a function of the high voltage (or as
a function of the electric ﬁeld on the cathode surface). The strong dependence
on the electric ﬁeld supports the interpretation of the events in favour of the α-
decays; the β-decays would never show such a dependence. To our knowledge,
this curve represents the ﬁrst measurement of the recombination factor for α-
particles in LAr as a function of the electric ﬁeld at ﬁeld strengths & 40 kV/cm.

where N is the number of electrons after recombination and N0 before the
recombination. C is a constant depending on the ionizing particle and the
medium, but not on the ﬁeld. For the ﬁeld, we use E = f × V where V is the
potential of the cathode, and f is the ampliﬁcation due to the sphere geometry.
For a sphere of radius r, one expects f = 1/r. From a ﬁt to the measured
curve as a function of the cathode voltage, we can extract C = 214 cm/kV,
f = 42 cm−1 and N0 = 141 · 103 electrons. The 68% C.L. for the parameters
assuming a 10% uncorrelated error on the points is 159 < C < 299 cm/kV,
29 < f < 55 cm−1 and (112 < N0 < 198)·103 electrons. A systematic variation
of the measured points by ±10% does not change appreciably the ﬁtted C and
f parameters which depend mostly on the changing slope of the curve.

The ﬁtted ampliﬁcation factor f = 42 cm−1 is in perfect agreement with the
measured properties of the cathode, since the radius of a sphere corresponding
to such an ampliﬁcation is r ≈ 1/f = 240 µm 4 . The measured diameter of
the electrode (see section 2) is 458 ±12 µm.

In order to compare this result to expectations, we developed a simulation of
the α-source. The number of ionization electrons was obtained by numerically
integrating dN/dx of the semi-empirical expression of Birks [5] along the track
of the α-particles [6]:

where w is the mean energy to produce an electron-ion pair in LAr, w =
23.6 eV. The Birks law parameters were extracted from measurements in a
LAr TPC with m.i.p. or stopping protons up to ≈ 30 MeV/cm at electric

variation of the ﬁeld over the range is less than 30%.

ﬁelds up to 500 V/cm[11]. In order to predict the recombination of the α, one
must extrapolate these parameters to very high ionization densities, between
750 and 1500 MeV/cm. The E-ﬁeld dependence of the Birks factor kB(E)
was obtained from the Box Model. For α-particles in LAr, we obtain C =
210 cm/kV. This is in excellent agreement with the observed shape of the
curve.

3.3 Drift electron lifetime

Selecting α-particle events with a cut on the pulse height, the measured anode
to cathode charge ratio Qa/Qc for each selected event is plotted versus the drift
time in Figure 9, for a distance of the electrodes of 20 mm and high voltages

12

of 1.5 and 2.5 kV. The drift time of the events varies between 15 ÷ 55µs for
the 1.5 kV and 12 ÷ 35µs for the 2.5 kV. This variation is due to diﬀerent drift
paths of the electrons in the dipole ﬁeld: the minimal drift time corresponds
to electrons drifting on the axis between the electrodes; electrons starting oﬀ
axis on the cathode sphere follow the dipole ﬁeld lines, i.e., they have a longer
drift path and, in addition, feel the smaller drift ﬁeld in the central region. A
direct ﬁt of an exponential decay function to the charge ratio as a function of
the drift time yields the mean lifetime τ of the electrons. Table 1 summarizes
the results obtained with diﬀerent high voltages for an electrode distance of
20 mm.

Fig. 9. The anode to cathode charge ratio is plotted as a function of the drift time.
From an exponential ﬁt the mean lifetime τ is obtained.

The capture cross section of electrons by electronegative impurities depends
on the electric drift ﬁeld [8], i.e., the observed drift-electron lifetime can also
depend on the drift ﬁeld and not only on the concentration of impurities. Since
the drift ﬁeld in our purity monitor is very inhomogeneous, this eﬀect can in
principle also distort the exponential decay curve of the charge. However, for
drift ﬁelds ≤ 600 V/cm the lifetime of electrons in LAr for a O2 concentration

13

of 3.5 ppb was measured to be almost constant [9]. As seen from Figure 3, the
drift path in the high ﬁeld (≥ 1 kV/cm) is only a very small fraction of the
total drift path and contributes very little to the drift time. Thus, only a small
correction, depending on the applied high voltage and the distance between
the electrodes, has to be applied to the measured drift time to normalize it to
a constant drift ﬁeld. This correction was not applied to the lifetimes given
here.

4 Conclusion

To conclude, we have developed a novel LAr purity monitor using an α-source
in a very high electric ﬁeld to produce the free drift electrons. The adopted
dipole geometry has allowed to avoid the otherwise typical strong quench-
ing of the α. We have measured the recombination factor of the ionization
charge from α-particles as the function of the electric ﬁeld, ranging from
40 ÷ 150 kV/cm.

In a series of measurements performed in a dedicated setup, drift electron
lifetimes of the order of 100 µs were measured at electrode distances of 20 mm
with a precision of 2-5 %. To measure longer lifetimes, up to a few ms, larger
electrode distances could be needed, making it necessary to install ﬁeld shaping
electrodes in the long drift region.

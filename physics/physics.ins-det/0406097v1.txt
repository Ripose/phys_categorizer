To prevent excessive radiation damage to its Silicon Vertex Tracker, the BaBar experiment at SLAC uses a
radiation monitoring and protection system that triggers a beam abort whenever radiation levels are anomalously
high. The existing system, which employs large area Si PIN diodes as radiation sensors, has become increasingly
diﬃcult to operate due to radiation damage.

We have studied CVD diamond sensors as a potential alternative for these silicon sensors. Two diamond sensors
have been routinely used since their installation in the Vertex Tracker in August 2002. The experience with these
sensors and a variety of tests in the laboratory have shown CVD diamonds to be a viable solution for dosimetry
in high radiation environments. However, our studies have also revealed surprising side-eﬀects.

1. Introduction

1 cm2

The BaBar experiment[1] at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) employs a
radiation monitoring and protection system
SVTRAD[3] to safeguard the Silicon Vertex
Tracker (SVT)[2] from excessive radiation dam-
age. The SVTRAD system uses 12 Hamamatsu
S3590-08 silicon PIN diodes with dimensions
300 µm, arranged in two rings and
1
mounted close to the readout electronics of the
Layer-1 SVT modules. The diodes are reverse bi-
ased at 50V and are connected to a custom-built,
DC-coupled read-out board. This board mea-
sures the total current ﬂowing through the sen-
sor, which consists of a dominant leakage current
and a small radiation-induced current. The read-
out board regularly calibrates the baseline leak-
age current when beams are absent and corrects
for temperature ﬂuctuations measured by ther-
mistors installed close to the PIN diodes. The
read-out board continuously subtracts the esti-
mated leakage-current from the total current to
obtain the radiation-induced component, and is-
sues a beam abort when the radiation currents
are above predeﬁned threshold values.

SVTRAD has been in active operation since
the start of BaBar in 1999 and has issued on av-
erage 2-3 beam aborts per day. While successful
so far in keeping radiation damage to the SVT
within acceptable limits, the system has become
increasingly diﬃcult to operate because of radia-
tion damage to the silicon sensors. Some of the
sensors have accumulated a dose of approximately
2 Mrad, resulting in leakage currents exceeding
3 µA. The precision on the estimated pedestal
is approximately 0.1% of the leakage current, re-
sulting in a systematic uncertainty on radiation
currents of a few nA - comparable in magnitude
to average radiation levels. Without intervention,
the system would become inoperable within one
or two years due to further radiation damage.
We therefore searched for sensor materials that
are more radiation hard than silicon. The most
promising material was CVD diamond.

2. CVD diamonds

The use of polycrystalline CVD diamond as
a radiation - or particle detector has been ex-
tensively studied by the RD42 collaboration[4,5].
Over the last 10 years, the sensitivity to ra-
diation has improved by almost an order of

1

2

magnitude, with charge-collection-distances now
reaching levels of 250 µm. Polycrystalline CVD
(pCVD) diamond sensors are grown on silicon
substrates using hydrogen and methane as source
gases. An artifact of the production process
is that diamonds exhibit a columnar growth
structure, with grain dimensions of typically 10-
100 µm. Much of the electrical properties of
pCVD diamonds are determined by the grain
boundaries, where graphite and other impuri-
ties are accumulated. These impurities lower the
resistivity and act as possible traps of drifting
charges, leading to a loss of sensitivity to radi-
ation.

When operated as a radiation sensor, a high
voltage is applied across the electrodes on either
side of the CVD diamond wafer. Electron-hole
pairs created by incident ionizing particles drift
apart in the electrical ﬁeld,
leading to a cur-
rent ﬂow that is proportional to the dose rate.
Maximum charge collection for pCVD sensors is
achieved at an electric ﬁeld of typically 1V/µm.
pCVD diamond sensors do not reach their full
eﬃciency immediately, but only after they are
fully ’pumped’ by radiation. In this process, the
charge traps in the grain boundaries are ﬁlled so
that they no longer act as a source of ineﬃciency.
An important beneﬁt of diamond over silicon as
a radiation sensor material is its radiation hard-
ness. Crucially important for the application as
a DC coupled dosimeter in BaBar is that leakage
currents are virtually absent (few pA) and do not
increase with accumulated dose.

3. CVD diamonds in BaBar

To determine whether diamond sensors present
a viable alternative to PIN diodes, two CVD dia-
mond sensors of 1x1 cm2 area and 0.5 mm thick-
ness have been installed inside the BaBar SVT in
August 2002. They were placed in the horizontal
plane of the detector, on either side of the beam
pipe, approximately 15 cm from the e+e− interac-
tion point and 5 cm from the beam line. Much of
the radiation in BaBar is concentrated in this hor-
izontal plane, since oﬀ-track beam particles are
swept in the horizontal direction by the ﬁnal fo-
cusing magnet. The dose rate during stable beam

operation is typically 25 mrad/s in this horizontal
plane, and approximately 5 mrad/s elsewhere at
the same radius.

The collection distance of both sensors has
been measured to be approximately 200 µm at
500 V. Both diamonds are biased at 500 V
to ensure maximum sensitivity. The sensitiv-
ity of this diamond sensor has been measured
to be approximately 100pC/mrad, compared to
200pC/mrad for the Si PIN diodes. Ohmic con-
tacts of 0.9x0.9 cm2 are applied to either side and
are soldered to coax cables with Indium solder,
electrically shielded and insulated.

The currents in the sensors are measured with
the same type of read-out board that is used for
the Si PIN diodes. The readout is integrated in
the BaBar online monitoring system.

4. Operational Experience

The sensors have been in routine operation for
almost two years, presenting the longest contin-
uous operation of diamond sensors and the ﬁrst
such use in a running High-Energy Physics ex-
periment. The current in one of the two diamond
sensors during typical beam conditions is shown
in ﬁgure 2, along with the radiation levels as mea-
sured by one of the 12 PIN diodes.
It can be
clearly seen that variations in dose rates due to
diﬀering beam currents are well tracked by both
sensors. The diamond sensor, however, gives a
more precise measurement since it is not aﬀected
by temperature ﬂuctuations. The correlation be-
tween the radiation levels and the current in the
diamond sensor is excellent. The SVTRAD sys-
tem stores a 10 second long snap-shot of the ra-
diation levels prior to each beam abort. Figure
1 shows that the response of the diamond sensor
on such small time scales is also well correlated
to the response in other sensor. In a dedicated
tests with a fast custom-built ampliﬁer we have
measured the response time on spikes of radia-
tion to be less than 20 ns, in agreement with and
limited by the bandwidth of the ampliﬁer. This
is comfortably within the limit of 100 µs required
for the SVTRAD system.

Up to now, the diamond sensors have received
over 500 krad of integrated radiation dose. No

5. Side-eﬀects

We have observed notable side-eﬀects related
to the stability of the current in pCVD sensors.
One is the presence of non-exponential tails after
the sudden drop in radiation levels, as illustrated

in ﬁgure 3. This ’after-glow’ is visible on time-
scales from milliseconds to minutes, and has been
reported elsewhere[6,7,8]. It could be explained
by the thermal evaporation of charge stored in
shallow traps inside the diamond bulk. The non-
exponential nature of the tails points to the pres-
ence of multiple traps with diﬀerent energies. A
continuum of traps of diﬀerent relaxation times τ
1/τ 3/2 leads to a
and occupation levels N (τ )
1/√t dependence, which gives a good description
of the data.

Another side-eﬀect is the occurrence of erratic
dark currents, which were discovered when the
1.5 T magnetic ﬁeld that immerses the BaBar de-
tector temporarily switched oﬀ. Right after the
magnetic ﬁeld disappeared, dark currents started
rising from a few pA to 100 nA for one diamond

sensor and to 4 nA for the other, both ﬂuctu-
ating by up to 50%. When the magnetic ﬁeld
reappeared the dark currents vanished.

We have carried out an extensive test program
to reproduce this eﬀect in the lab and to elucidate
the nature of the erratic dark currents. For these
test we used four new sensors of the same dimen-
sion as the sensors installed. Two of four sensors
had the electrodes segmented in 2x2 pads and all
sensors were equipped with a guard ring, giving a
total of 10+4 channels on four sensors. Further-
more, half of the sensors were metalized with Al
to study the eﬀect of the Schottky barrier.

Before irradiating the sensors they were biased
at 500 V for three weeks to see whether the dark
currents could appear spontaneously. We found
that erratic dark currents appeared in 7 of the 14
channels after a period ranging between 2 days
and two weeks. Since no anomalously high cur-
rents were present at the guard ring, and since a
single pad could show erratic dark currents while
the other three pads were still quiet, we conclude
it to be a local eﬀect.

The sensors were subsequently irradiated in a
60Co source at diﬀerent bias voltages and at dif-
ferent dose rates. We found no erratic dark cur-
rents in any of the sensors when biased at 100 V
for a week. In contrast, erratic dark currents ap-
peared in each of the 14 channels when biased
at 500 V. The currents were orders of magnitude
higher than before irradiation and persisted out-
side the 60Co source. No diﬀerences have been
observed between the two diﬀerent metalizations.
We have veriﬁed that a suﬃciently high (> 1T)
magnetic ﬁeld, perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld
inside the sensor, always eliminates the erratic
dark currents, as shown in ﬁgure 4.

Indications are that the (increase of) erratic
dark currents due to irradiation can be undone
by heating the sensor to 400 ◦C, a temperature
at which charge stored in deep traps is thermally
evaporated. At temperatures below 100 ◦C, the
erratic dark currents increase by approximately
4%/◦C.

6. Conclusions and outlook

In almost two years of operation, pCVD dia-
mond radiation sensors have proven to be a vi-
able alternative to silicon PIN diodes for radia-
tion monitoring in BaBar. Although intended as
a feasibility study, the two diamond sensors in-
stalled already play a vital role in BaBar, giving
a more precise and stable measure of the dose rate
than the PIN diodes. Still, there are important
side-eﬀects in diamonds that deserve particular
attention. In the summer of 2005 we plan to in-
stall 12 new diamond sensors to replace all of the
PIN diodes.

We thank the RD42 collaboration and Element

Six for providing the CVD diamond sensors.

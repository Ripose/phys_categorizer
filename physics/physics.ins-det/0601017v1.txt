Abstract. The main results of the quality assurance tests performed on the Resistive Plate Chamber
used by the ATLAS experiment at LHC as muon trigger chambers are reported and discussed. These
are dark current, gas volume tomography, gas tightness, efﬁciency, and noise rate.

INTRODUCTION

Resistive Plate Chamber RPC [1] will be used as the muon trigger detector, in the barrel
region of the ATLAS experiment at LHC [2]. A total number of 1116 RPC modules
will be installed, for a total surface area of about 3800 m2. The extreme difﬁculty in
accessing the ATLAS detectors, after installation is complete, imposes a high standard
quality assurance for these modules. For this purpose three cosmic ray teststands have
been built at INFN Napoli[3], Lecce [4], and Roma 2. Here, we report on the results
from the Lecce site.

ATLAS RPC MODULES

In the ATLAS muon spectrometer a large variety of sizes and shapes of stations and,
hence, RPC counters is foreseen. All counters, however, share the standard internal
structure, described here in the following.

A unit consists of a doublet of RPC detector layers enclosed in rigid lateral proﬁles
and two support panels. A thin honeycomb-paper panel with aluminum skin separates
the two layers realizing two independent Faraday cages. In ﬁgure [1] a cartoon of a RPC
layer and a read-out panel are shown. A RPC layer contains a 2 mm thick active gas
layer inside a planar bakelite gas volume (≈ 1010W cm) externally painted with graphite.
The gas volume is surrounded by two pick-up strip panels segmented in two orthogonal
views and separated by insulating plastic foils. The gas volume high voltage electrode
is connected directly to the power supply, but the other one is connected to ground by a
shunt resistor, in such a way that the dark current can be monitored.

The RPC dimension can be as large as 4.8 m in one direction and 1.1 m in the other.
Depending on the module size, a bakelite gas layer can consist of a single gas volume
or of two adjacent gas volumes, and, most of the times, a read-out strip plane consists of

FIGURE 1. Drawing of ATLAS RPC layer (a) and read-out strip panel (b).

two adjacent strip panels, instead of one. This results in modules which have 2 or 4 gas
volumes and 4 or 8 read-out strip panels.

QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURE

The quality control of the RPC chamber is accomplished with a series of accurate
measurements and tests intended to verify the correctness of the assembly and detector
performance. They represent the very ﬁrst full chamber characterization and allow to
extract statistical information useful to monitor the assembly line and give useful feed-
back for improvements.

The quality control procedure consists of main certiﬁcation tests and subsidiary con-
trol tests. The main tests regard leakage current versus high voltage curves, chamber
efﬁciency and noise versus high voltage and front-end voltage threshold, and, ﬁnally,
chamber 2D tomography. Instead, subsidiary control tests regard pulse test, gas volume
leak test, front-end current absorption, and gas volume leakage current temporal drift.

QUALITY ASSURANCE RESULTS

Gas volume tests

The radiation reliance and aging properties of the ATLAS RPC has been proven and
carefully investigated at X5 gamma irradiation facility at CERN [5]. Nevertheless, the
quality control of the gas volumes is crucial. The dark current versus high voltage curve
is measured during the chamber conditioning and at the end of the tests. Gas volumes
showing a dark current with a large ohmic or exponential part are rejected. In addition the
dark current of each gas volume is monitored continuously to look for anomalous drift
or current glitches (maybe due to local discharge or defective high voltage connectors).
In ﬁgure [2] on the left the gas volume dark current distribution of ATLAS RPC tested
in Lecce is shown at nominal conditions. On the same ﬁgure, on the right, is plotted the
distribution of the difference between the high voltage power supply current and the gas

difference distribution (on the right). The data are taken from the ATLAS RPC tested in Lecce with a high
voltage of 10kV.

volume current. From this plot is possible to infer a high level of electrical insulation
between gas volumes and other parts, such as mechanical supports and read-out strip
panels (> 100GW

) .

The 2D efﬁciency of each gas volume is measured with high accuracy and this is the
most time consuming test which takes about 24 hours of running. The muon cosmic ray
tomography is a very powerful tool to discover gas volume assembly defects (due for
example to glue spots, badly glued spacers, and inner surface contaminations) which
can compromise the aging performance of the unit. A noise rate 2D map is also taken, in
order to exclude the presence of hot spots, which can become degenerative in the long
term period. A gas volume tomography of a special unit is reported in ﬁgure [3]. This
particular gas volume has a cut-out in order to leave room for the barrel toroid feet. Other
special counters have gas volumes with cut-out for the alignment laser rays of the MDT
precision muon chambers. Figure [3] shows that the high quality of the gas volumes is
also achieved when shapes more complicated than the rectangular one are realized.

ATLAS RPC tested in Lecce with an equivalent input voltage threshold of about 0.5 mV.

Gas tightness test, which is performed independently for each layer, consists in mon-
itoring the differential pressure for about 2 hours, after imposing about 3 mbar of over-
pressure and closing the gas inlet and outlet. With our instrumental sensitivity of about
10−1 mbar we can reject modules with a gas leak larger than about 10−4mbar l
s.

Read-out strip panel tests

The read-out strip panel efﬁciency (given by the convolution of gas volume efﬁciency
and strip panel electronic efﬁciency) is measured as a function of the applied high
voltage and front-end voltage threshold. This allows to establish the detector working
point and the parameter range where the chamber performs well. In ﬁgure [4] the
distribution of the read-out strip panel efﬁciency (dead channels included) and the
average cluster sizes (number of adjacent ﬁring strips) are shown. The RPC counters
have in average an efﬁciency greater than 97%, as expected by the detector active area
coverage and required by the trigger design.

The read-out strip panel noise rate is also measured at different high voltage and
voltage threshold. In ﬁgure [5] the corresponding distribution is shown on the left. The
average noise rate is less than 1 Hz
cm2 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the
expected counting rate due to the photon and neutron background in the ATLAS exper-
iment at the designed LHC luminosity. In the same ﬁgure on the right, we reported the
distribution of the ratio between the gas volume dark current (with the ohmic component
subtracted) and the total strip panel noise rate. By assuming that the exponential part of
the dark current is due to noise counts, we can estimate an average saturated avalanche
charge of about 15 pC.

Production components yield

Table [1] reports the number of counters which failed the quality assurance test and
the defective component responsible for the rejection. A rejection rate of about 6% is due
to the gas volumes, which are discarded, 14% to the read-out panels, which are repaired,
and, ﬁnally, 6% to assembly errors. Taking into account the number of components
inside a module (we tested about 2000 strip panels and 1000 gas volumes), we have a
yield of 98.5% for gas volume and 98.3% for the strip panel (without considering the
factory single component pre-selection).

CONCLUSIONS

The cosmic rays teststand for the ATLAS RPCs in Lecce is routinely in operation
since July 2004, and up to now, july 2005, it has certiﬁed about 270 RPC modules,
corresponding to about 25% of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer. The test results and their
statistical distributions show that the RPC properties are stable and uniform, satisfying
the ATLAS experiment requirements. The end of the Quality Assurance Tests is foreseen

for the end of October 2005.

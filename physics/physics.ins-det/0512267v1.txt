The MiniBooNE neutrino oscillation experiment at Fermilab uses 1520 8-inch PMTs:

1197 PMTs
are Hamamatsu model R1408 and the rest are model R5912. All of the PMTs were tested to qual-
ify for inclusion in the detector, sorted according to their charge and time resolutions and dark rates.
Seven PMTs underwent additional
low light level tests. The relative detection eﬃciency as a function
of

incident angle for seven additional PMTs was measured.

Procedures and results are presented.

1. Introduction

The MiniBooNE experiment at the Fermi Na-
tional Accelerator Lab is searching for neutrino
oscillations of the type νµ → νe [2]. The exper-
iment is designed to conﬁrm or rule out the evi-
dence for such oscillations presented by the LSND
experiment, performed at Los Alamos in 1993-
1998 [3]. MiniBooNE started running in 2002
and expects to continue taking data at least into
2006. The MiniBooNE detector is a 12 m diam-
eter spherical tank of undoped mineral oil. The
main tank volume is deﬁned by an optical bar-
rier and is viewed by 1280 phototubes. Outside
the barrier is a veto region viewed by an addi-
tional 240 tubes. Of the 1520 phototubes in the
MiniBooNE detector, 1197 are inherited from the
LSND experiment, and the rest were more re-
cently purchased from Hamamatsu. The LSND
tubes are 8 inch (20 cm) in diameter, 9 stage,
Hamamatsu R1408 PMTs, while those newly pur-
chased are 8 inch, 10 stage, Hamamatsu model
R5912 PMTs.

A schematic and photo of the neutrino detector
is shown in Fig. 1. More details on the tests used
to characterize phototubes for installation in the
detector can be found in Ref. [4], and more on the

2. PMT qualiﬁcation and characterization

Prior to installation in the MiniBooNE detec-
tor, all PMTs were tested to measure: dark cur-
rent, time jitter, charge resolution, double puls-
ing, and pulse shape. Using these characteris-
tics the PMTs were qualiﬁed for installation, and
grouped into four categories according to time
and charge resolution. Each PMT category was

randomly distributed in the detector. Those with
the worst time resolution but low dark rate were
placed in the veto region.

A schematic of a single tube in the test setup
is shown in Fig. 2. The bulk of the measurements
were performed in a dark room that could accom-
modate up to 46 phototubes at a time. Tubes
were conditioned under high voltage in the dark
for 12-24 hours before testing. Dark rates were
recorded at a range of operating voltages with
no light source. Light from an LED pulser was
distributed to each tube with optical ﬁbers, with
the end of each ﬁber positioned about 20 cm from
PMT face. The LED wavelength was 450 nm and
it ﬂashed with 1 ns pulses at a rate of 1 kHz, pro-
ducing light levels ranging from 0.5 to 2 photo-
electrons (PE) per pulse.

Operating voltage was selected to obtain a gain
of 1.6 × 107 electrons/PE. The gain was deter-
mined by dividing the average response — the
total charge for all pulses with response above
threshold divided by the number of such re-
sponses — by the average number of PEs for
the given light level, which was determined from
the number of null responses. Charge resolution
was determined from the width of the one photo-
electron peak. Time resolution was taken as the
width of the distribution of the time the PMT
pulse crossed half maximum of its response to the
LED pulse.
In studying post-pulsing behavior,
the type of most concern for MiniBooNE is so-
called early post-pulsing, when the second pulse
occurs 8-60 ns after the primary pulse — because
data in the experiment are recorded in 100 ns
intervals. Such post-pulsing can occur when an
electron from the primary cascade is ejected from
the ﬁrst dynode and moves inside the PMT dome
before settling back on the ﬁrst dynode to initiate
a secondary cascade. Tubes were found to have

such double pulse rates of a few percent. Dis-
tributions of these measurements are shown in
Figs. 3 and 4.

3. Low light level tests

Seven phototubes

(three R5912 and four
R1408) were measured using very low light lev-
els. The same apparatus as described above was
used with the addition of neutral density ﬁlters so
that the probability for producing 2 PE or more
was less than 0.001, or equivalently less than 45
visible PMT response waveforms per 1000 LED
triggers.

The two types of PMTs show diﬀerences in

gle photoelectron response for one R1408 (dc40)

dent light consisted of a 150 liter tank with walls
coated with the same black paint used in Mini-
BooNE. A 26 cm diameter window allowed light
from outside to illuminate a PMT housed inside
the tank, and the PMT could be rotated in pitch
and yaw with externally-coupled mechanical con-
trols. An LED light source was directed toward
the window from a distance of 3 m so that the en-
tire face of the tube was approximately uniformly
illuminated with parallel light. Ambient mag-
netic ﬁelds were suppressed by a µ-metal shield
outside the tank. Measurements were performed
with and without mineral oil in the tank.

Response measurements were performed by
varying the pitch angle from −180◦ to +180◦ in 5◦
steps, and four R1408 and three R5912 tubes were
tested. Each phototube is rotationally symmetric
about its central vertical axis, except for its dyn-
ode structure. The R1408 tubes have “venetian
blind” dynodes and the R5912 tubes have “box
and line” dynodes. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were
observed when the dynodes were oriented hori-
zontally, vertically, or at 45◦ relative to the pitch
angle scan. In addition, one tube’s response as
a function of yaw angle was compared to its re-
sponse in pitch angle and no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
was observed.

Maximum response was assumed to occur at
zero incident angle, and the relative response
measured in oil for seven phototubes is shown in

(LSND) and R5912 (“new”) PMTs prior to selec-
tion for installation in MiniBooNE.

single photoelectron response. The integrated
charge distributions from one R1408 PMT and
one R5912 PMT are shown in Figure 5. The
three measured R5912 tubes had average charge
response of 2.26 pC and average charge distribu-
tion width of 0.89 pC, while the four R1408 tubes
had average charge of 1.96 pC and average charge
width of 1.32 pC. The R1408 tubes have a pro-
nounced high charge tail.

of the PMT response on the angle of the inci-

air and water measurements shown are from the
SNO experiment[6], which employs R1408 tubes.
MiniBooNE’s air measurements agree with those
from SNO.) Finally, Fig. 7 indicates the diﬀer-
ence that remains between the measured relative
response in oil and that predicted due to the PMT
geometry. This information is used to model the
PMT response in the MiniBooNE detector simu-
lation.

The relative response is predominantly due
simply to the solid angle subtended by the tube
as a function of incident angle. The curve la-
beled “Hamamatsu PMT drawing” in Fig. 7 in-
dicates the relative response predicted using the
PMT shape speciﬁed in the Hamamatsu techni-
cal drawing, which is nearly hemispherical but
a bit more bulbous. The medium surrounding
the tube also plays a role: Fig. 7 shows that the
relative response progressively increases for air,
water, and mineral oil, which is due to the pro-
gressively better matching of the medium’s re-
fractive index with that of the PMT glass. (The

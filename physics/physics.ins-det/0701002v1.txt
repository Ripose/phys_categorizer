Abstract

This article describes the technical implementation and the performance of the z-
vertex trigger (CIP2k), which is part of the H1-experiment at HERA.

The HERA storage ring and collider was designed to investigate electron (and
positron) proton scattering at a center-of-mass energy of 320 GeV. To improve the
sensitivity for detecting non-standard model physics and other high momentum
transfer phenomena, the HERA ring has been ugraded between 2000 and 2003 to
increase the speciﬁc luminosity for the experiments. In order to cope with the in-
creased event and background rate the experiments were upgraded, too. The CIP2k
trigger system is based on a set of ﬁve cylindrical multiwire proportional chambers
with cathode pad readout, and allows to distinguish between events induced by
beam background and ep-interactions at the ﬁrst trigger stage. The trigger decision
is calculated dead-time free with a latency of 1.5 µs in parallel to the beam clock
at 10.4 MHz. The trigger-logic is realized in large ﬁeld programmable gate arrays
(FPGA) using the hardware description language Verilog. The system is opera-
tional since October 2003. It suppresses background events with high eﬃciency and
provides event timing information, as designed.

1 Introduction

During the period 1993-2000 each of the two experiments at the HERA col-
lider, H1 and ZEUS, collected an integrated luminosity of approximatly 100 pb
(HERA I run). The subsequent upgrade of the accelerator lead to a signiﬁ-
cantly increased speciﬁc luminosity in 2004, namely 1.7 × 1030cm−2s−1mA−2
three times higher as compared to HERA I. The target for the integrated
luminosity is 250 pb
per year. This was achieved by increasing the proton
beam current and by reducing the beam cross sections at the interaction point
(IP). The latter required the installation of strong superconducting focussing
magnets inside the H1 experiment [1] close to the IP, which allow an early
separation of the electron and the proton beam. The new beam parameters
are listed in Table 1 in comparison to those of HERA I.

The change of the beam optics led to signiﬁcantly increased beam induced
background in the experiment, whose separation from ep interaction as fast
as possible is crucial for eﬃcient data taking. In the H1 experiment the cor-
responding event-by-event trigger decision is based on timing or on the re-
constructed vertex position using fast drift or multiwire proportional chamber
data. In HERA I running a trigger based on the information of two sets of two
cylindrical multiwire proportional chambers (central inner (CIP) and central
outer (COP) MWPC) was used for this purpose [2,3]. It reconstructed the ver-
tex position along the beam axis within ±30 cm around the IP and delivered
an event timing. This information was part of most H1 trigger decisions.

To cope with the high background rate the central inner proportional chambers

of the H1 experiment and the trigger based on their signals were redesigned
to allow reconstruction of the vertex position over a range of 3.5 m along the
beam axis (z-vertex). With increased acceptance beam induced background
can be more eﬃciently rejected.

The construction of the new central inner proportional chamber, the design
and the implementation of the z-vertex trigger derived from it, and the per-
formance of the complete system are described in this article.

1.1 Background situation

The deﬂection of the electron beam induced by the strong focussing mag-
nets near the interaction point creates a high level of synchrotron radiation of
about 100 kW intensity. The interaction region is designed such that most of
this synchrotron radiation is absorbed far away from the experiment. The clos-
est absorber for synchrotron radiation is located at z = −10.8 m, i.e. 10.8 m
away from the IP 5 . A small fraction of the synchrotron radiation is reﬂected
back rather than being absorbed. Two collimators in the beam pipe (C5A
at z = −80 cm and C5B at z = −145 cm) protect the H1 detector against
this backscattered synchrotron radiation. The setup is depicted in Fig. 1. The
synchrotron radiation leads to increased rest-gas pressure in the beam pipe
close to the absorber at z = −10.8 m, and consequently the rate of colli-
sions of protons with the gas molecules is high. In these beam-gas interactions
oﬀ-momentum particles are produced creating hadronic showers through sec-
ondary interactions in the collimators, and high particle multiplicities in the
tracking detectors. At HERA II this mechanism is the dominant source of
beam induced background [4].

In order to use the high luminosity provided by HERA II eﬃciently the fraction
of background events has to be suppressed at an early stage of the trigger.
Due to the ﬁxed bandwidth of the H1 data acquisition system, it is mandatory
to identify these interactions without causing any interruption of data taking.
Each event which is not ﬁltered out at the ﬁrst level of the pipelined trigger
system causes deadtime.

5 At the H1 experiment, the z-axis points along the proton ﬂight direction, the
x-axis points towards the center of the ring, the y-axis in the upward direction. The
origin of this right handed Cartesian coordinate system is the nominal interaction
point of the H1 experiment. The azimuthal angle in the xy-plane is ϕ. The polar
angle is Θ (positive z, Θ = 0). The parts of the detector with positive (negative) z
coordinates are often referred to as the forward (backward)regions.

Fig. 1. Synchrotron radiation background: Bending of the electrons (1) leads to a
high amount of synchrotron radiation which reduces the quality of the vacuum in
the beam pipe (2). As a consequence the background rate rises due to collisions of
protons with rest gas nuclei (3), which are observed in the H1 detector as hadronic
showers (4)

1.2 Background identiﬁcation

Background events can be identiﬁed if their origin along the beam axis (z-
vertex) is known. This is obvious from inspecting Fig. 9 in Sec. 3.1.3, which
shows the reconstructed z-vertex distribution observed in a typical HERA II
run. Beam induced background events originating from the collimators C5A
and C5B and ep-interactions can clearly be distinguished. The CIP2k z-
vertex trigger system was therefore developed to reconstruct the trajectories of
charged particles coming from interactions near the beam axis. It determines
the vertices and creates a corresponding histogram for each bunch crossing.
Event signatures with most of the tracks pointing to the backward region are
rejected by the trigger.

The track reconstruction is based on data from a set of ﬁve cylindrical mul-
tiwire proportional chambers (central inner proportional chambers: CIP2k)
with cathode pad readout. As the name indicates the CIP2k encompasses the
interaction region in the center of H1 detector. It has a total of 8480 readout
pads, providing space points and timing information. Each layer is equally
subdivided into 16 azimuthal segments in ϕ with approximately 20 mm wide
segmentation along the beam axis. The chamber has suﬃcient granularity to
resolve the event structure, even in high multiplicity events. Five layers ensure
a high redundancy for the reconstruction with a negligible rate of combinato-
rial background. Operation of the trigger system remains eﬃcient even if one

4

or two layers of the chamber are not operational. Simulation studies were done
beforehand in order to optimize the granularity of the chamber and to deter-
mine the expected redundancy and background rejection power [5, 6]. Since
multiwire proportional chambers are characterized by a response time below
10 ns [7], the CIP2k z-vertex trigger delivers accurate event timing (t0) with
optimal eﬃciency.

All H1 detectors and trigger systems store their information for 32 bunch
crossings (3.1 µs) [1]. The level 1 (L1) trigger decision starts the readout after
2.3 µs, hence all L1 signals have to be delivered not later than 2 µs. The deci-
sion has to be made for every bunch crossing. Thus all pads have to be read
out within 96 ns, corresponding to the bunch crossing frequency of 10.4 MHz.
In the CIP2k trigger system this requirement is met using large ﬁeld pro-
grammable gate arays (FPGA) both for the trigger decision and the storage
of the event data for readout by the data acquisition system.

2 Multiwire proportional chamber

2.1 Construction

The construction of the CIP2k in the University of Z¨urich shops followed
closely that of a thin cylindrical proportional chamber with cathode pad read-
out [2] which was installed in H1 during the HERA I run. This chamber also
delivered signals for a z-vertex trigger [3] and ran very stable and eﬃciently
over the whole data taking period of HERA I.

The cylindrical chamber has ﬁve radial layers with an inner radius of 154 mm
and an outer radius of 196 mm and an active length of 2170 mm. The total
length of the chamber 2366 mm including end ﬂanges and 120 mm for the
electronics and the cooling. The chamber encloses the nominal interaction
region and is mounted between the central silicon detector [8] on the inside and
the central drift chamber (CJC) [1] on the outside. The active region extends
from z=-1121 mm to z=1049 mm, corresponding to an angular acceptance
11◦ < Θ < 169◦. Figure 2 shows a cross section of the chamber. All necessary
details for the construction techniques and the choice of materials are given
in ref. [9].

The sandwich-like construction of each radial layer shown in Fig. 3 was chosen
in order to keep the material budget low without compromizing on stability
and robustness. Each layer contains 480 gold-plated tungsten anode wires,
≈2 mm spaced, with a diameter of 25 µm and mounted in a gas volume of ≈ 16
liters. They are kept at a voltage between 2250 and 2500 V. At the outer layers

a lower voltage is needed, since electric ﬁeld on the wire is higher. The wires are
supported by epoxy rings at one and two thirds of the chamber length. A 3 mm
gap separates the anode from the cathode planes, which consist an aluminum
foil (25 µm thickness) on the inner and a carbon coated capton foil on the outer
side. The charge collected on the anode wires induces a charge on the high
resistivity cathode planes (550-600 kΩ/(cid:3)) and a signal on the copper pads on
the outer side of the capton foil. Copper was chosen as pad material instead
of aluminum as in the original central inner proportional chamber [2], because

6

a large fraction of the induced signal was lost in the latter case where the pad
thickness was smaller than the skin depth. Furthermore the signal transmission
was improved by using miniature coaxial cables [10,11] with very low dielectric
and inductive coeﬃcients to transport the induced charge (O(105) electrons)
of each pad to a connector at the rear end ﬂange of the chamber. These cables
are embedded in groves in the layer of Rohacell [12] (thickness 1mm), which
backs the foils and guarantees for the mechanical stability. Each pad covers
22.5◦ in azimuth. In z-direction, the size and number of pads vary at each
layer as described below.

2.2 Pad geometry

The arrangement of the pads is optimized for a simple trigger algorithm. While
the pad size is constant within each layer along z, it increases proportional to
the distance from the beam axis from 18.25 to 23.464 mm (projective geome-
try). The innermost pad size was dictated by the requirement that two pads
taken in a logical OR match the granularity of the previous set up [3]. The
pads are arranged such that tracks from the same vertex generate similar pat-
terns independent of Θ, as described in Sec. 3.1. Every 328.50 mm the pads of
the ﬁve layers are exactly aligned above each other. This distance equals two
bins in the z-vertex histogram. In total, there are 8,480 pads in 16 ϕ-sectors
(see Table 2).

2.3 Gas system and high voltage distribution

The chamber is operated with a gas mixture of argon (49.9%), isobutane
(49.9%) and freon (0.2%). The gas ﬂow is controlled by the H1 wide gas
control system [1]. Two independent closed loops supply the ﬁve layers. The
static pressure of the chambers relative to atmospheric pressure is regulated

7

to be within ± 50 µbar. This ensures that the active gap in the chamber is not
distorted. Since the tracking detectors are surrounded by a N2 atmosphere,
contamination with N2 through leakage and other changes in the gas mixture
are monitored constantly in order to avoid changes in the gas ampliﬁcation.

The 480 anode wires of each layer are grouped into 32 sectors of 15 wires.
Each group is connected to a high voltage cable via 3.3 MΩ resistor, while
the anode wires are connected to their neighbours with a 1 MΩ resistor. This
allows a high voltage degrading in case of a short circuit in one region of the
chamber with minimal eﬃciency loss [14]. An illustration of the high voltage
distribution is given in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Two HV supplies [13] with trip protection are connected to 15 HV wires of
the chamber covering 11.25◦ in ϕ.

2.4 Front end electronics

The pad information is transferred to the front end electronics via a 120-pin
connector on the chamber. Sixteen connectors per layer transmit the signals
of all pads along z of one ϕ-sector. The front end electronics consists of 80
highly integrated readout boards with a size of 5 × 13 cm2 in 12-layer printed
circuit board (PCB) technology. They were developed at the Paul Scherrer
Institut. Each board covers one ϕ-sector and contains two application speciﬁc
integrated circuits (ASIC) especially developed for the readout (called CIPix)
and two 17:1 multiplexers [15]. The information of one double layer is sent via
an optical ﬁbre to the receiver cards 40 m away in the electronics trailer of
the experiment.

2.4.1 The CIPix readout chip

Each CIPix readout chip has capacity for 64 analog inputs, of which up to 60
are used while the remaining serve testing purposes. The CIPix readout chip
was developed at the ASIC laboratory of the University of Heidelberg in a

8

0.8 µm CMOS-process. Figure 5 shows the block diagram of one CIPix chip.
Each of the 64 analog input channels consists of:

• A charge-sensitive preampliﬁer with a gain of 20 mV per 105 electrons. The

preampliﬁer characteristics are programmable.

• An analog signal shaping to a CR-RC semi-Gaussian pulse with program-

mable shaping times.

• Digitalization by a one-bit comparator with programmable threshold and
polarity. The digitized information is synchronized to the 10.4 MHz beam
clock signal.

The digitized pad information is multiplexed fourfold into 17 digital channels
(15 outputs and two control channels) at 41.6 MHz in each CIPix. In parallel,
one analog output channel is provided, which can be used to monitor any
of the 64 input channels. The ﬁrst of the four multiplexed pads is tagged,
and hence allows a synchronization with the demultiplexing electronics in the
trigger system. All boards of one layer are interconnected by an I 2C bus
daisy-chain. This allows to set all programmable parameters layer-wise and a
serialized temperature measurement [16]. The I 2C system itself is controlled
by the experiment control system PVSS II [17, 18].

2.4.2 Readout board, optical link and cooling

Figure 6 provides an overview of the electronics on the chamber, while Figure 7
contains details of the front end PCB. The 15 plus 2 output channels of a CIPix
are multiplexed to one output signal per CIPix and transmitted to an optical
link system [19]. Pairs of adjacent boards are interconnected by a ﬂexible strip-
line on a capton foil carrier. One of the PCBs holds the optical link system
while the other one holds the I 2C interface and the voltage regulators. They
are powered from the electronics trailer. The overall synchronisation is done

9

with the global HERA clock signal. It is the input for a low jitter phase-locked
loop which generates the 41.6 MHz clock. The latter is delivered to the 17:1
multiplexers and in addition to the HERA clock to all four CIPix chips.

Fig. 6. A schematic overview of the CIPix double board which reads out the pad
information of two ϕ sectors of one layer. The two boards are interconnected by a
ﬂexible strip-line on a capton foil carrier to a double-board. One of the two boards
holds an optical transmitter unit to transmit the information of one double-board
with optical ﬁbres to the receiver cards.

Since only optical transmission can support the high rates with low cross talk
and a minimal power consumption, an optical link between the on-detector
electronics and the receiver cards was developed by ETH Z¨urich based on op-
tical hybrids which do the electro-optical conversion [19]. These hybrids have
six sender and two receiver diodes for the 10.4 MHz HERA clock. For redun-
dancy two HERA clock signals are transmitted in parallel. The six senders
transfer four digital data channels - one for each CIPix - with the signals of
two ϕ sectors and two analog channels - each shared by two CIPix - to the
readout system. All the light guides from one transmitter unit are bundled
into a single cable.

The front end boards are cooled by direct contact to copper blocks which
are connected to an outer and an inner cooling ring above and below the
readout electronics. Both rings are water-cooled. The cooling of the boards is
critical, because excessive heating may destroy the bond wires, which connect
the readout ASIC to the board. Moreover, the connections within the 12 layer

10

PCB could also suﬀer.

3 Trigger

The CIP2k trigger electronics serves two purposes:

• It uses the chamber information of all 8,480 pads to deliver trigger informa-

tion for each bunch crossing to the H1 central trigger.

• It stores all the chamber information in a pipeline and delivers it to the H1

storage system in case of a positive trigger decision.

3.1 Trigger algorithm

A pipelined trigger algorithm has been developed which is divided into ﬁve
steps [20]:

(1) Trackﬁnding
(2) Assembly of the z-vertex histogram
(3) Histogram analysis
(4) Collection of information from the ϕ-sectors.
(5) Trigger decision

The ﬁrst three steps are done in parallel for every ϕ-sector in the trigger cards,
the summation in step four in the sum cards, and the ﬁnal trigger decision in
the master sum card. The algorithm has been implemented in APEX 20k400
FPGAs [21], is written in the hardware description language Verilog and made
use of the development environment Altera Quartus (see ref. [20] for details).

11

3.1.1 Track reconstruction:

The information coming from the receiver cards is fed into the FPGAs of the
trigger where it is ﬁrst demultiplexed four times. Pads known to be defect may
be permanently switched oﬀ or on in a ﬁlter module. At every startup of the
trigger system, a list of defect pads is updated via the VME bus. In a second
step valid track patterns with hits in at least four chamber layers are searched
for. The projective geometry of the chamber simpliﬁes this task, since a given
z-position leads to a unique pattern of pads showing hits in the ﬁve layers.
This is illustrated in Fig. 8. To allow for local ineﬃciencies the corresponding
z-position of the track is stored even if a pad in a pattern is missing. The
valid patterns are predeﬁned in the local environment (LE) of every pad in
the central layer. Each possible track pattern in the LE then points to a given
z-bin. Since 22 z-bins are deﬁned there exist 22 valid patterns in each LE.

Fig. 8. Trackﬁnding with projective pad geometry: tracks from the same vertex
cause similar patterns in the local environment of each central pad in layer 2. The
grey shaded area shows the LE of central pad 42 (left) and 9 (right), respectively.
The track pattern pointing to z-bin 13 is deﬁned in the same way for every LE:
Pad 8 in layer 0, pad 6 in layer 1, pad 5 in layer 3 and pad 13 in layer 4 deﬁne a track
f rom z-bin 13, similarly for track pattern 8 (13,9,3,9).

3.1.2 Assembly of the z-vertex histogram

For each z-bin at total of 106 tracks can be identiﬁed corresponding to the
number of pads in layer 2 and hence to the number of LEs. If a track is iden-
tiﬁed in the trigger module it is written into a 106 bit wide hit vector, deﬁned
for each of the 22 z-bins. The tracks in the hit vector are counted for each
bin in the adder module, which uses a major part of the FPGA logic because
22 · 106 = 2332 possible tracks have to be checked and summed up. The re-
sult is evaluated in less then two bunch crossings (≤ 192 ns) in a cascade of
adders, which counts the tracks in the hit vector in six steps (144 ns). Only 15
consecutive bins out of 22 are used for the trigger decision, corresponding to

12

1590 possible tracks. They represent the z-vertex histogram for one ϕ-sector,
calculated in one trigger card. The selection of the 15 out of 22 bins is pro-
grammable in the range −235.4 < z < +125.4 cm (see Fig. 9). For monitoring
purposes, the histogram is stored in a pipeline and can be read out via the
VME bus together with the chamber information of the event.

3.1.3 Histogram analysis

For the trigger decision the bins of the z-vertex histogram are grouped into a
forward, a central and a backward region. This selection is programmable as
shown in Fig. 9 for two examples. The conﬁguration adapted to ep event ﬁxes
the backward region of the trigger to the range −186 < z < −55 cm and the
central region to −55 < z < 60 cm. The second example concerns the cosmic
muon trigger which requires coincidences between two ϕ quadrants.

gions of the CIP2k z-vertex trigger are shown below the histogram. 15 of 22 bins are

in luminosity runs, while conﬁguration (2) is used for cosmic muon detection. The
third line indicates the acceptance and the bin width of the old z-vertex trigger [3].

3.1.4 Summing

Once the number of tracks in the three regions of each ϕ-sector is known,
they are added in two consecutive steps to give a global, ϕ independent track
distribution. The information of four ϕ-sectors is added ﬁrst in the pre-sum
card to yield z-vertex regions for the four quadrants of the CIP2k chamber.
The number of tracks of the quadrants is then added to get the global z-regions
in the main sum card. To keep the number of transfer cables to a reasonably
low level, the number of tracks is limited to 255 in each region.

3.1.5 Trigger decision

A trigger decision is made by analyzing the track information in the forward,
central and backward region based on global track information of each event
in the pipeline. A precise timing information is evaluated (t0, 1 bit). It is set,
if at least one track in the central region is identiﬁed by the z-vertex trigger.
To analyze the quality of the ep-event, the number of tracks identiﬁed in all
three regions (4 bits) and the ratio between the number of central tracks and
backward tracks (2 bits) is given to the central H1 trigger control. Up to 16
trigger elements (bits) [20] may be deﬁned. They are transferred to the central
trigger system for every event.

3.2 Trigger electronics

Seven crates house the trigger hardware: four trigger crates (TCr), one sum
(SCr), one komposti (≡ internal label) and one subsystem trigger control (STC)
crate [22]. Figure 10 provides an overview of the trigger electronics.

3.2.1 Trigger crates:

Each trigger crate hosts ten receiver (RC), four trigger (TC) and two control
cards (CC) as well as one VME CPU. The crates have a special backplane
and additional power supply units for 3.3 V and -5 V [23].

Each optical ﬁber originating from the CIPix PCB ends in a receiver card,
which collects the information of four CIPix units, converts the optical signals
to electrical signals and performs the 1:17 demultiplexing step. A clock signal,
phase-locked to the HERA clock, is also generated here. The pad and clock
signals are sent to the P2-backplane of the trigger crate [19]. This backplane
was specially developed at the University of Heidelberg [24] to cope with the
high number of chamber signals. Ten 96-pin three-row connectors are needed.
The signals of a group of ﬁve RCs are linked into two trigger cards on the

front side. Each trigger card deals with the information of all ﬁve layers of one
ϕ-sector. A control card serves each pair of trigger cards and the ﬁve receiver
cards linked to it with the control signals and extracts the pad information of
the two innermost layers to the old z-vertex trigger system [3]. The control
card also contains hardware to monitor and control the relative phases of the
clock signals.

The trigger card contains both the logic of the trigger algorithm and the
storage pipeline for the chamber data of one ϕ-sector. In total 16 trigger cards
are needed to process the complete chamber information, distributed across
four crates. The trigger card, realized as an 8-layer PCB, was designed in
cooperation with University of Heidelberg [24]. Each trigger card contains
two Altera FPGAs [21], mounted in a ball grid array technique onto the PCB.
The board is equipped with a 5 V to 1.8 V power converter to deliver the 1.8 V
FPGA kernel voltage. External 3.3 V and 5 V power supplies are needed for
the FPGA I/O pins and the VME bus and the IsPL [27] who controls it (see
Fig. 11). Six EEPROMs [25], three for every FPGA contain the conﬁguration
code, three for every FPGA.

Fig. 11. Schematic view of the trigger card (TC).

To transport the chamber information from the 250-pin input connector on
the trigger card to the FPGAs 150 lines are needed. The trigger algorithm is
distributed over two FPGAs, because one does not suﬃce for a complete ϕ-
sector. Every FPGA deals with the information of 60 pads of ﬁve layers (15×4
multiplexed channels). Tracks that point to pads of both CIPixes deﬁne the
overlap area, known to both FPGAs. A 90 line interconnect bus connects both
FPGAs. Information evaluated by FPGA I is transferred to FPGA II. FPGA II
is connected to two SCSI-connectors to deliver ϕ-based data to the sum cards
via LVDS converters [26], which transform the 3.3 V FPGA output (LVTTL,
low voltage TTL) to a LVDS (low voltage diﬀerential standard) signal.

Every trigger card is equipped with a 32-bit VME bus controller residing in
an in-system high density programmable logic device (IsPL) [27]. The 24-bit
standard non-privileged address mode is used. 32 bidirectional data lines are
linked to both FPGAs and to the ISpL, which is set up as a VME-bus slave
unit and organizes the data transfer from the FPGAs to the VME bus master.

The pad information of the chamber is stored in a ring buﬀer (pipeline) 32
bunch crossings deep. Each trigger card provides the information of one ϕ-
sector. In case of a positive level 1 trigger decision, data taking stops and the
readout of the triggered event is organized. Five bunch crossings around the
expected ep-event are read out. It takes 20 VME read cycles to read out one
BC of one TC, 320 cycles per BC in total [20].

16

3.2.2 Summing crate

The trigger information of each trigger card is transferred to the summing
crate (VME 21-slot 64x [23]). Here all 16 ϕ sectors are combined and a trigger
decision is calculated. Five identical sum cards are used to perform this task.
Four cards receive the information of four trigger crates each and combine it
for a quadrant (pre-sum card, see Fig.10). The ﬁfth card, the main sum card,
combines everything and distributes the decision (the trigger elements (TEs))
to the H1 central trigger control (CTC). For monitoring, inputs and output
signals of each sum card are read out.

The sum card was also developed in cooperation with University of Heidel-
berg [24], and is built around a single FPGA and an ISpL for conﬁguration
and VME bus service. The sum card is equipped with a 32-bit VME bus (6
address bits in a 16-bit mode, AM 0x29). For the conﬁguration of the FPGA,
three EEPROMs [25] are used. Each sum card is equipped with six SCSI con-
nectors (ﬁve 68-pin and one 50-pin micro sub-D). The signal levels meet the
LVDS standard. Each 68-pin connector transfers 32 single channels; the 50-pin
connector transports 24 channels. In Figure 12 the sum card design is shown
in a schematic view.

case of a power failure. A 32 bit VME bus supports readout and programming of
the FPGA (6 address bits).

17

Each sum card has a piggy back board to cope with the large number of
signals, which are processed in the sum card. Three 68-pin SCSI connectors are
mounted on the piggy back board and are connected to the FPGA. The SCSI
connectors can be used as input or output channels, depending on the LVDS
converter/driver chip [26]. The master sum card receives the signals from the
four pre-sum cards by four 68-pin input connectors, the trigger decision is
provided on the 50-pin output connector.

3.2.3 Komposti crates

The komposti crate (VME 21-slot [23]) holds eight komposti cards, which use
the same hardware as the sum card, but diﬀer in the programming of the
FPGA. The komposti card demultiplexes the data of the two innermost layers
(120 pads of layer 0 and 1 of two ϕ-sectors) and merges it to 56 output signals
provided at the two output SCSI connectors. Four pads of the new chamber are
merged to one input channel for the old trigger system [3]. The merged data
is linked into 8 passive (without power supply and active electronic elements)
converter cards that form the LVDS signal of the komposti card to a pseudo-
analog diﬀerential input signal in two 50-pin connectors. Together with the
pad information of the two layers of the outer proportional chamber (COP),
the old z-vertex trigger can be used in a 3-out-of-4 layer option [3], since the
information of layer 0 and layer 1 is combined at the komposti card (logical
AND).

Running the old trigger in parallel was demanded because it entailed a thresh-
old cut on the transverse momentum of a track pt > 0.5 GeV/c, had a ﬁner
z−resolution, and it also served calorimeter trigger towers.

3.3 Data acquisition

The CIP2k DAQ system consists of four VME CPU processor boards [28],
which communicate with the trigger cards, do the initial setup of the trigger-
system and read out the stored chamber information from the ring buﬀer in the
FPGA. Each CPU reads the data of four ϕ sectors. The CPU and the trigger
card communicate via the VME bus, using single cycle D32/A24 access. The
CPUs are interconnected by a PCI vertical interconnect bus system [28].

Once the H1 central trigger decides to keep an event, all four CPUs start
the readout simultaneously, triggered by high priority interrupts. The readout
time is dominated by reading the pad data of ﬁve time slices from the VME
bus. Using the pVIC bus the information from all ϕ sectors is collected on a
single crate. This synchronous part of the readout ends after 1 ms, as required
for H1 data acquisition systems. 16 buﬀers are available at this stage, in order

18

to avoid possible second order deadtime eﬀects caused by trigger bursts. The
asynchronous part of the readout operates on these buﬀers. It starts with
a data reduction reduction process on the main CPU. The chamber data,
which are stored as bit patterns, are translated into 16-bit wide pad numbers,
resulting in an eﬀective zero suppression if the occupancy of the chamber is less
than 10 %. During this process, pads that are known to be bad are removed
from the data. Identical ﬁlters are applied during the trigger algorithm in
order to ensure consistency of data and trigger. The data are then transferred
by the VME bus to the H1 central data acquisition system [29].

3.3.1 Control system

An I 2C-bus [33] based system was developed to program the registers of the
CIPix [16]. The system is controlled by an 8-bit microprocessor (pic16F877)
that is addressed via a RS232 serial port connection. The programming of the
CIPix settings is done by a Linux-based PC, installed in the H1 control room
with a 25 m long RS232 cable connection to the I 2C-bus micro controller in
the electronics trailer (CIPix-trailer-box).

Moreover, a temperature control system was developed, using a (separate)
one-wire-bus [32], which is connected to a temperature measurement chip on
each CIPix board at the detector. This chip is connected to a second serial port
of the CIPix-trailer-box and sends the measured temperatures to the CPU in
the komposti crate, The VME CPU receives the actual temperature and sends
a continuous signal to a watch dog card. In case of high temperature or any
other failure this signal stops and the watchdog switches oﬀ all CIPix board
power supplies.

4 System performance

The CIP2K trigger system is fully operational since autumn 2003. Some basic
performance tests of the new chamber and trigger electronics will be presented
in this section. The comparisons presented below are all based on particle tra-
jectories reconstructed in the central jet chamber (CJC). The spatial resolution
of the CIP2K chamber and the trigger timing as well as single pad eﬃciencies
are studied with muons from cosmic rays, trigger eﬃciencies with ep data.

19

4.1 Spatial resolution

Events with cosmic muons are selected to determine the spatial resolution.
These events consist of two track halves, reconstructed in opposite sides of the
CJC. The two track halves are constrained to have common track parameters,
which improves the CJC z position measurement signiﬁcantly. Figure 13 shows
the diﬀerence in z between the track position extrapolated to the CIP2K wire
plane and the center of the active pads in the corresponding azimuthal sector
for three layers.

corresponding azimuthal sector.

The RMS-width of the distribution is 1.9 cm, 2.2 cm and 2.3 cm. This is in
good agreement with the expected width, dominated by the ﬁnite pad size
and the z resolution of the CJC chamber. The chamber noise is negligible, as
there are virtually no entries outside ±6 cm.

4.2 Trigger timing

The trigger timing is studied using the event sample with cosmic rays. Since
the muons are not synchronized to the HERA beam clock it is possible to
reconstruct the time resolution of the CIP2K system. The events are triggered

20

by the drift-chamber trigger [31], which has only a moderate time resolution
(στ ≫ 50 ns). Figure 14 shows the CJC event time for events with the CIP2K
T0 trigger active. The CJC event time is the time at which the muon was

The width is found to be σ = 7.1 ns, well compatible with expectations from
chamber and electronics design.

4.3 Chamber and trigger eﬃciency

The chamber eﬃciency was also deduced from the muon sample. The tracks in
this sample are predominantly produced at polar angles Θ ≈ 90◦. They cover
the full range along the z axis. Figures 15(a) and (b) show the pad eﬃciency
for all pads in one azimuthal sector in layer 0 and layer 1. Clearly visible is the
reduced eﬃciency in both planes at z ≃ −40 and z ≃ 33 cm which corresponds
to the position of the support rings for the anode wires. Figure 15(c) shows
the trigger track eﬃciency which is measured with ep data as a function of
the polar angle Θ. For this study tracks are selected which are isolated in
the CJC. A CIP2K trigger track requires a valid pattern with hits in at least
four layers. The single-track trigger eﬃciency in ep events is better than in
the muon sample, because most tracks in ep events have polar angles diﬀerent
from 90◦, so their average energy loss is higher. Furthermore, tracks passing
the chamber at these polar angles may induce signals on several adjacent
pads, again increasing the detection eﬃciency. The wire support structures
are arranged far from the nominal interaction point, and their impact on the

21

detection eﬃciency of tracks from ep collisions is not visible anymore. Lastly
Fig. 15(d) shows the t0 eﬃciency - the eﬃciency for ﬁnding a CIP2k track in the
central region needed for event timing - as a function of the track multiplicity.
For events with only one reconstructed track it is 95 %. This includes also
ineﬃciencies due to broken readout electronics and HV problems.

4.4 Background discrimination

One of the main tasks of the CIP2K trigger system is the discrimination of
ep events and high-multiplicity background events with displaced z-vertex at
the ﬁrst trigger level. For many physics channels a veto condition is applied
on the ﬁrst trigger level, based on CIP2K signals. An example of a fairly soft
veto condition is the following:

• more than 100 tracks found in the CIP2K system
• the number of tracks with reconstructed z-vertex in the central region must
not exceed the number of tracks with reconstructed z-vertex in the backward
region.

Two diﬀerent event samples have been studied to monitor the performance of
this veto condition. A minimum bias sample has been selected based on ran-

22

domly triggered events, independent of any detector activity. Alternatively,
the veto condition was studied for events triggered by a localized energy de-
position in the liquid argon calorimeter (LAr electron trigger). Only those
events are considered in the analysis with at least one good CJC track within
the CIP2K acceptance. The CJC tracks are required to have a minimum of 20
detector hits, in order to ensure a good z coordinate measurement. Since the
z-vertex reconstruction often fails for background events, the z-vertex position
of the primary interaction was estimated using the track with the largest num-
ber of hits. Events with tracks not pointing back to the same vertex within
250 cm were excluded from the analysis. This removes events where the track
reconstruction failed, but retains most events with multiple interaction ver-
tices. Figure 16 shows the z-vertex position as deﬁned above for the minimum
bias sample (top) and the sample triggered by the LAR trigger (bottom). The
shaded histogram shows the events which are rejected by the CIP2K veto
condition.

−90 cm and Z = −150 cm, correspond to the position of the collimators C5a
and C5b, respectively. Secondary interactions of proton-gas interactions in
the collimator produce events with high particle multiplicities. The ﬂat dis-
tribution along z mainly stems from electron-gas interactions. These events
usually have low track multiplicities. No enhancement around the nominal
interaction region at z = 0 ± 30 cm is visible. The background rejection by
the z-vertex trigger can be further improved if the high multiplicity cut of the
veto condition is reduced. In combination with early signals from the back-
ward scintillator veto wall [1] the rejection in the collimator region reaches
values close to 100 %.

5 Summary

This publication describes the new ﬁve layer multi wire proportional chamber
CIP2k with optical readout and a z-vertex trigger system for the H1 detector
at HERA II. The main purpose of the trigger system is the suppression of
high multiplicity background events originating from the backward part of
the detector at the ﬁrst trigger level. After the luminosity upgrade of the
HERA collider, the rate of such events has increased signiﬁcantly. The new
chamber with the z-vertex trigger system is fully operational since autumn
2003. The trigger system is capable of reconstructing the z-vertex position
in parallel to the HERA beam clock at 10.4 MHz. The latency of the trigger
decision is only 1.5 µs. This was achieved by choosing FPGA technology for
the track ﬁnding and histograming algorithms.

The performance of the new CIP2K trigger system was analyzed. The chamber
behaves as expected in terms of spatial and time resolution. The single track
trigger-eﬃciencies are close to 100 %. The CIP2k trigger decision serves as
the main time base for other track based trigger systems. A veto condition for
rejecting background produced by secondary interactions in collimators in the
vicinity of the interaction point was studied in greater detail. Such algorithms
have become an integral part of the H1 trigger system, and help to keep the
H1 data taking eﬃciency high.

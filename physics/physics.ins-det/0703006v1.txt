Abstract

The signal induced by an electron on a pickup strip has been calculated in
a RPC used in INO calorimeter [1] following Ramo’s theorem [2]. An accurate
estimation of weighting ﬁeld has been obtained using a nearly exact Boundary
Element Method (neBEM) solver [3] while the electron velocity from the real
ﬁeld values. The calculation has shown a growth and subsequent fall of pickup
signal with duration about 90ps.

Introduction

The resistive plate chamber (RPC) has become an integral part of modern high en-
ergy experinments owing to its simple design and construction, good time resolution,
high eﬃciency and low cost production. Several problems like inherent rate limita-
tion and much debated space charge eﬀect have induced various studies on detailed
simulation of RPC signals considering diﬀerent physics and electronics aspects.

The induction of signal in the electrodes of a chamber can be treated by Ramo’s
theorem following which the electrostatic and weighting ﬁelds turn out to be two
fundamental quantities. In general, instead of carrying out detailed computation for
realistic RPC geometries of severl layers of dielectrics, the weighting potential and
ﬁeld of a RPC is determined for a simpler geometry of three layers for which 2D
analytic solutions can be derived [4]. A thorough study on the 3D ﬁeld distribution
is required for realistic conﬁguration of a RPC in order to achieve a true estimation
of the induced signal. The ﬁeld computation is usually carried out using commercial
Finite Element Method (FEM) packages, although, it is known to yield poor accu-
racy despite of rigorous computation. A precise computation of 3D ﬁeld distribution
has been carried out using a nearly exact Boundary Element Method (neBEM). In
this formulation, many of the drawbacks of the standard BEM like singularities and
near-ﬁeld inaccuracies could be removed due to use of analytic solutions of potential
and ﬁeld. A simple calculation of induced signal due to the motion of an electron in

the chamber volume has been carried out with precise computation of 3D weighting
and actual ﬁeld for actual geometry of an RPC to be used in INO calorimeter.

2 Signal Induction Process

According to Ramo’s theorem, the current i(t) induced due to a charge cluster e0N (t)
moving with a drift velocity ~vD(t) = ˙~x(t) can be evaluated as follows:

i(t) = e0N (t) ~vD(t). ~Ew(~x(t))

where ~Ew(~x(t)) is the weighting ﬁeld at ~x(t) associated with the electrode under
It may be mentioned here that the weighting ﬁeld can be obtained when
study.
readout electrode is set to 1V keeping all other electrodes grounded.

The results obtained for three layer INO RPC following analytic solutions and
neBEM calculations have been illustrated in ﬁg. 1(a) for three diﬀerent positions
along the axis of the geometry. The analytic expressions have been found to be valid
up to two more resistive layers. However, inclusion of further layers has brought in a
signiﬁcant change (see ﬁg.1(b)) indicating that the naive use of analytic expressions
may lead to non-negligible errors.

3.2 Comparison with other methods

The solver has been validated by computing the electrical properties of a conﬁg-
uration containing two layers of dielectrics with a thin layer of graphite on each

dielectrics following standard formulations [5] and neBEM have been tabulated in
table 1, R being the ratio of dielectric constants of upper to lower plate.

3.3 Calculation for INO RPC

A glass RPC with glass and gas thickness of 2mm has been considered. A thin
graphite coating of thickness 50µm has been provided with a high voltage of 8.5KV.
The readout strips are separated from the graphite layers by a PET ﬁlm, 100µm
thick. Five readout strips in X-direction have been considered with thickness 16µm,
width 3cm and pitch 1mm while the Y-readout has been considered to be an uni-
form plate of same thickness. The length of the chamber in Z-direction has been
made 50cm. However the inclusion of PET ﬁlm above the graphite layer has been
found to generate some numerical instability and excluded afterwards. The dielec-
tric constants of glass, graphite and gas layers have taken to be 7.75 (ﬂoat glass),
12 and 1.000513 (Argon) respectively. The results of the weighting and real ﬁeld
distributions have been shown in ﬁg.2(a) and (b).

3.4 Calculation of induced signal

The induced current has been calculated at intervals of 10ps during the passage of
the electron in the gas gap. The electron has been assumed to pass perpendicu-
larly across the detector plane at its center with a velocity 50µm/ns [6] starting
from an initial position 10µm above the lower glass layer. The weighting ﬁeld has
been evaluated at each position of the electron due to the central readout strip
while the velocity has been determined from the real ﬁeld using neBEM. The re-
sult is plotted in ﬁg.3 which has shown the growth of the signal while electron
has moved in the gas gap and a subsequent fall as the electron has left the gap.
A rough estimate of the intrinsic tim-
ing resolution [7] with the values of
Townsend and attachment coeﬃcients
following the detector simulation pack-
age GARFIELD [8] for the electric ﬁeld
as estimated by the neBEM has turned
out to be about 1
4 ns.

Time (ps)

Using the neBEM solver, the three di-
mensional weighting potential and ﬁeld
can be calculated precisely even for a
very detailed geometry of a RPC. This
allows us to simulate the induced cur-
rent on any electrode of a RPC due to
the passage of an ionizing particle. The drift velocity of the particle can be calculated
using GARFIELD. However, the inclusion of several very thin layer of dielectrics has
been found to generate numerical instabilities for which the solver would have to be
optimized.

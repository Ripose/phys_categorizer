Abstract

In Extensive Air Shower (EAS) experiments, the primary direction is reconstructed
by the space-time pattern of secondary particles. Thus the equalization of the transit
time of signals coming from diﬀerent parts of the detector is crucial in order to get
the best angular resolution and pointing accuracy allowed by the detector. In this
paper an oﬀ-line calibration method is proposed and studied by means of proper
simulations. It allows to calibrate the array repeatedly just using the collected data
without disturbing the standard acquisition. The calibration method is based on
the deﬁnition of a Characteristic Plane introduced to analyze the eﬀects of the
time systematic oﬀsets, such as the quasi-sinusoidal modulation on azimuth angle
distribution. This calibration procedure works also when a pre-modulation on the
primary azimuthal distribution is present.

1 Introduction

In EAS experiments, the space-time information of the secondary particles is
used to reconstruct the primary direction [1,2,3]. The space information refers
to the detector unit position while the time information is achieved usually

by TDC (Time to Digital Converter). The former is easy to measure and sta-
ble in a long period, while the latter depends on detector conditions, cables,
electronics, etc, and usually varies with time and environment. The time oﬀ-
sets are the systematic time diﬀerences between detector units, which lead to
worse angular resolution, and more seriously, to wrong reconstruction of the
primary direction. As a consequence the azimuthal distribution is deformed
according to a quasi-sinusoidal modulation [4]. Thus the correction of these
systematic time oﬀsets [5] is crucial for the primary direction reconstruction,
much more when the EAS detector is devoted to gamma ray astronomy and
the pointing accuracy is required in order to associate the signals with astro-
physical sources. Usually manual absolute calibration by means of a moving
probe detector is used in EAS arrays, but this method takes time and man-
power. The diﬃculty increases taking into account that periodical checks are
necessary to correct possible time-drift of the detector units due to change in
the operation conditions. Furthermore the number of detector units in current
EAS arrays is getting larger and larger. As a conclusion, eﬀective oﬀ-line cali-
bration procedures are greatly needed because they do not hamper the normal
data taking and can be easily repeated to monitor the detector stability.

Here a new oﬀ-line calibration procedure is presented. It does not depend on
simulation and is very simple in the case of a uniform azimuthal distribution.
It works also when some small modulation of the azimuthal distribution is
expected, for istance due to the geomagnetic ﬁeld. The correctness of this
calibration method has been checked by means of simple simulations both in
the case of uniform and modulated azimuthal distribution.

2 Characteristic Plane

In EAS experiments, for an event i the time tij is measured on each ﬁred
detector unit j, whose position (xj, yj) is well known. The primary direction
cosines li = sin θi cos φi, mi = sin θi sin φi (θi and φi are zenith and azimuth
angles) can be reconstructed by a least squares ﬁt. Taking into account the
time oﬀset ∆j typical of the detector unit and assuming that the shower front is
plane and the time-spread due to its thickness is negligible, the plane-equation
is

c(tij − ∆j − t0i) = lixj + miyj

(1)

where c is the light velocity, and t0i is another parameter of the ﬁt. But the
time oﬀset ∆j is unknown and the goal of the calibration is just to determine
it. A traditional oﬀ-line calibration method is based on the study of the time-
residuals but their removal does not guarantee the removal of the complete

2

oﬀset. Therefore one can assume that the time oﬀset ∆j is the sum of two
terms: the residual term and another unknown term. Being unaware of ∆j the
plane-equation goes like:

i cos φ′
giving the fake direction cosines l′
and 2 and neglecting the residuals, it results:

i = sin θ′

i, m′

i = sin θ′

i sin φ′

i. From Eq.s 1

c (tij − t′

0i) = l′

ixj + m′

∆j = ai

+ bi

+ δ0i

xj

c

(2)

(3)

i − li, bi = m′

i − mi, and δ0i = t′

where ai = l′
0i − t0i is an irrelevant time-shift
equal for all the units. One can conclude that the oﬀset ∆j is correlated with
the position of the detector unit. The quantities ai, bi deﬁne a Characteristic
Plane (CP) in the (x, y, ∆) space, depending only on the ﬁred unit pattern,
representing the diﬀerence between the reconstructed plane without consid-
ering the time oﬀset (FP: Fake Plane) and the real one (RP: Real Plane).
Events ﬁring diﬀerent sets of units have diﬀerent CPs, while events ﬁring the
same set of units have the same CP, that is the diﬀerence between the FP and
RP is the same. We deﬁne the CP of an EAS array like the average diﬀerence
between FPs and RPs, i.e. the systematic deviation between FP and RP (the
pointing accuracy). The CP is fully determined by the direction cosines

a = hl′i − hli = sin θ0 cos φ0,

b = hm′i − hmi = sin θ0 sin φ0

(4)

associated to the angles θ0, φ0.

2.1 Quasi-Sinusoidal Modulation

If the probability density function (PDF) of the primary azimuth angle is
f (φ|θ), one can deduce that the presence of the CP introduces a quasi-sinusoidal
modulation of the reconstructed azimuth angle distribution :

f ′(φ′|θ) = f (φ|θ)

1 +

r
1 − r2 sin2(φ′ − φ0)

cos(φ′ − φ0)









q

(5)

where r = sin θ0/ sin θ. The PDF of the reconstructed azimuth angle is a
combination of multi-harmonics of odd orders with the the amplitude approx-
imately proportional to r2n+1 (n = 0, 1, 2...) when r << 1. The time oﬀset

3

(6)

(7)

does not introduce even order modulations into the reconstructed azimuth an-
gle distribution. When f (φ|θ) = 1/2π, the ﬁrst harmonic becomes dominant
and the PDF of the reconstructed azimuth angle goes as

f ′(φ′|θ) =

[1 + r cos(φ′ − φ0)]

1
2π

One can observe that the modulation parameters depend on the angles θ0 and
φ0 connected to the CP (see Eq.s 4). The phase is just φ0, while the amplitude
is proportional to r. By integrating f ′(φ′|θ) over θ it results

f ′(φ′) =

1 + sin θ0

cos(φ′ − φ0)

1
2π (cid:20)

1
sin θ (cid:29)

(cid:28)

(cid:21)

A fast Monte Carlo simulation was done to check the above conclusion. The
azimuth angle was sampled uniformly over [0, 2π] and the zenith angle from
a typical distribution modulated according to cos6 θ (the mode value is ∼ 22◦
and h1/ sin θi = 3.44). CPs with diﬀerent θ0 and φ0 were assumed, subtracting
sin θ0 cos φ0 and sin θ0 sin φ0 from the original direction cosines, respectively, in
order to get the new direction cosines. Fig. 1 shows the reconstructed azimuth
distributions for two diﬀerent CPs with θ0 = 0.02 rad, φ0 = 0.4 rad and θ0 =
0.20 rad, φ0 = 1.2 rad, respectively. The ﬁrst distribution is well reproduced by
a best-ﬁt function like that of the Eq. 7 as expected for small values of θ0. Also
the ﬁt parameters are in agreement with the simulation parameters. The higher
order harmonics must be taken into account in order to well reproduce the
second distribution (A2 and A3 are the amplitudes of 2nd and 3rd harmonics)
because in this case θ0 and r are larger.

3 Characteristic Plane Method

According to Eq. 1, if li and mi were exactly known, then any event can be
used to relatively calibrate all the detector units hit by that shower, while
l′
i − a and m′
i − b can be taken as unbiased estimate of li and mi. Therefore
the time correction is determined by a and b, i.e. the CP of the EAS array,
according to Eq. 3.

Suppose that the primary azimuth angle is independent on the zenith angle
and distributes uniformly, then hli = 0, hmi = 0. Thus a = hl′i − hli = hl′i,
b = hm′i − hmi = hm′i, which means that the CP of an EAS array can be
determined by the mean values of the reconstructed direction cosines. Then
the time oﬀsets can be calculated by means of the oﬀ-line analysis of the
collected data.

3.1 A simple simulation as a check of the CP method

Another fast geometrical simulation was implemented in order to check the CP
method. One million of showers were extracted from the same distributions
of θ and φ used in Sec. 2.1. The arrival primary directions were reconstructed
by an array of detector units (10 × 10 units on a surface of 40 × 40 m2). The
times measured by each unit were shifted by systematic time oﬀsets (ﬁrst plot
of Fig. 2). As a consequence the primary directions were reconstructed with
respect to a CP with a = 3.97 × 10−3 and b = 7.34 × 10−3 (mean values of
the reconstructed direction cosines). From the Eq.s 4 it is trivial to estimate
θ0 = 8.3 × 10−3 rad and φ0 = 1.07 rad.

The reconstructed azimuth distribution is ﬁtted according to Eq. 7 (see the
ﬁrst plot of Fig. 3). As expected the modulation coeﬃcient p1 and the phase p2
are compatible with sin θ0 h1/ sin θi = 0.029 and φ0, respectively. The angles
between reconstructed and ”true” direction are shown in the ﬁrst plot of Fig. 4.

The calibration based on the CP method allows to correct the time measure-
ments, removing the eﬀect of the time oﬀset on each detector unit. In the
second plot of Fig. 2 the oﬀset-calibration diﬀerences are almost null and the
RMS is lower than 2.3 × 10−2 ns. As an eﬀect of the CP calibration the mod-
ulation disappears in the azimuth distribution (second plot of Fig. 3) and the
reconstructed directions are very close to the ”true” ones (see the second plot
of Fig. 4). Then the validity of the CP method is fully conﬁrmed.

3.2 Pre-modulation on the primary azimuth angle

The assumption for the CP method is that the mean values of the primary
direction cosines are null. Generally this is not true for EAS experiments. The
possible primary anisotropy, the detection eﬃciency depending on the azimuth
angle, the geomagnetic eﬀect, and so on, introduce pre-modulation into the
azimuth angle distribution. Assuming that the φ-distribution is independent
on θ, the pre-modulation can be described typically as:

f (φ) =

1
2π "

1 +

∞

n=1
X

gn cos(nφ + φn)
#

.

Only g1 cos(φ + φ1) contributes to the mean values of the primary direction
cosines. Therefore they result

hli = +

cos φ1 hsin θi ,

hmi = −

sin φ1 hsin θi .

(9)

g1
2

The CP method annulls hli and hmi leaving a sinusoidal modulation on the
distribution of the new φ′′ azimuth angle. When g1 and g2 are small enough
and the higher order harmonics can be ignored (see Sec. 2.1) the distribution
approximately is

f ′′(φ′′) =

[1 + g′

1 cos (φ′′ + φ1) + g2 cos (2φ′′ + φ2)]

1 = g1

hsin θi

(cid:20)

sin θ (cid:29)(cid:21)

.

(cid:28)

On the basis of this result one can conclude that the calibration with the
CP method does not remove completely the pre-modulation on the primary
azimuthal distribution. The g1, g2 amplitudes and the φ1, φ2 phases can be
determined from the reconstructed azimuth angle distribution according to
Eq.s 10 and 11. Then the direction cosines of the real CP can be determined
by subtracting the pre-modulation term (Eq.s 9).

Fast simulations have been used also to check the calibration method in the
case of pre-modulation with one and two harmonics (g1 = 0.05, φ1 = 0.3 rad
and g2 = 0.02, φ2 = 1.2 rad). The results are very similar to those of Sec. 3.1
conﬁrming that the method works also when a pre-modulation is present. In
Fig. 5 the ”true” azimuthal distribution and the distribution after the ﬁrst
step of the calibration are shown. As expected the second distribution is well
reproduced by Eq.s 10 and 11.

Azimuth angle (rad)

Fig. 5. The pre-modulation ”true” azimuth angle distribution is ﬁtted by the
function f (φ) = k [1 + g1 cos(φ + φ1) + g2 cos(2φ + φ2)]. The after-calibration az-
imuthal distribution is ﬁtted according to Eq.s 10 and 11. The ﬁt-parameter values
are in full agreement.

3.3 Geomagnetic Eﬀect

The geomagnetic ﬁeld inﬂects the charged primaries and leads to the well
known East-West eﬀect (with the modulation period of π which does not
modify the mean values of the reconstructed direction cosines and does not
invalidate the CP method), while the secondary charged particles of EAS
are separated in the geomagnetic ﬁeld with the lateral distribution getting
wider and ﬂatter, thus aﬀecting the detection eﬃciency [6]. A non-vertical
geomagnetic ﬁeld destroys the uniformity of the detection eﬃciency along the
azimuth angle which will further leads to quasi-sinusoidal modulation on the
azimuth angle distribution [7]. The geomagnetic eﬀect on the secondaries is
typically the most signiﬁcant pre-modulation (as described in Sec. 3.2) with
amplitude of the order of few percent and very slight variations with the zenith
angle. This is just the case discussed in the above section and the modulation
can be determined according to Eq. 10, after which the time can be oﬀ-line
calibrated using the CP method.

4 Conclusion

The deﬁnition of the CP makes it easier to understand the eﬀects of the de-
tector time oﬀsets in EAS experiments, and makes the oﬀ-line calibration
possible. One can successfully correct the time oﬀsets and remove the quasi-
sinusoidal azimuthal modulation (with φ depending on θ). The calibration

procedure has been analytically deﬁned and checked by means of fast simu-
lations. The CP calibration is very simple when the ”true” azimuthal distri-
bution is uniform (this feature can be also achieved by selecting special event
sample). The CP method works also when a ”true” pre-modulation (with φ
independent on θ) of the azimuth distribution is present. The improvement in
the pointing accuracy is well shown in Fig. 4 for the simulation of Sec. 3.1.
In real cases, the pointing accuracy will depend on the detector performances
and on quality and statistics of the data used for the CP calibration.

This method has been successfully applied to calibrate EAS detectors [8]. It
has been also checked [9] by Monte Carlo full simulation and by sampling
manual calibration. The experimental results of the CP method application
will be the topic of a future paper.

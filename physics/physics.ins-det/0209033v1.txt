Abstract

The paper describes a new concept of visible pump/X-ray probe/slow detector
experiments that could be performed at third-generation synchrotron light sources.
We propose a technique that would allow time resolution up to femtosecond capa-
bilities to be recovered from a long (100 ps) X-ray probe pulse. The visible pump
pulse must be as short as the desired time resolution. The principle of operation of
the proposed pump-probe scheme is essentially based on the statistical properties
of the synchrotron radiation. These properties are well known in statistical optics
as properties of completely chaotic polarized light. Our technique utilizes the fact
that, for any synchrotron light beam there exist some characteristic time (coher-
ence time), which determines the time-scale of the random ﬂuctuations. The typical
coherence time of soft X-ray synchrotron light at the exit of monochromator is in
the femtosecond range. An excited state is prepared with a pump pulse and then
projected with a probe pulse onto a ﬁnal ion state. The ﬁrst statistical quantity
of interest is the variance of the number of photoelectrons detected during syn-
chrotron radiation pulse. The statistics of concern are deﬁned over an ensemble of
synchrotron radiation pulses. From a set of variances measured as a function of
coherence time (inversely proportional to monochromator bandwidth) it is possible
to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process.

1 Introduction

Time-resolved experiments are used to monitor time-dependent phenomena. The
study of dynamics in physical systems often requires time resolution beyond the
picosecond capabilities presently available with synchrotron radiation. Femtosecond
(10−15s) capabilities have been available for many years at visible wavelengths.
There exists a wide interest in the extension of femtosecond techniques to the soft
X-ray, and X-ray regions of spectrum.

The time resolution of pump-probe experiment is, obviously, determined by the
duration of the pump as well as the resolution of the probing. The pump pulse must
always be as short as the desired time resolution. In typical scheme of a pump-
probe experiment (see Fig. 1) the short probe pulse follows the pump pulse at some
speciﬁed delay. The signal recorded by the slow detector then reﬂects the state of
the sample during the brief probing. The experiment must be repeated many times
with diﬀerent delays in order to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process
[1,2].

The obvious temporal limitation of the typical visible pump/X-ray probe technique
is the duration of the X-ray probe. Here we will concentrate on the performance
obtained with third-generation storage rings. At these sources, the X-ray pulse du-
ration is about 100 ps. The new principle of pump-probe techniques described below
oﬀers a way around this diﬃculty. We propose visible pump / X-ray probe technique
that would allow time resolution up to femtosecond capabilities to be recovered from
a long X-ray probe pulses (see Fig. 2). The principle of operation of the proposed
pump-probe scheme is essentially based on the statistical properties of the syn-
chrotron radiation. Synchrotron radiation is a stochastic object and at a given time
it is impossible to predict the amount of energy which ﬂows to a sample. For any
synchrotron light beam there exist some characteristic time, which determines the
time-scale of the random ﬂuctuations. This characteristic time is called, in general,
the coherence time τc of the synchrotron light beam. Its magnitude is of the order
of the inverse of the frequency spread of the beam. In all the theory that follows,
attention is restricted to synchrotron light beams whose frequency spreads are small

compared with the mean frequency, that is, where ω0τc is very much larger than
unity. Figure 3 illustrates the type of ﬂuctuations that occur in the synchrotron
radiation beam intensity and phase. The ﬁgures have been constructed by a com-
puter simulation of a synchrotron light source in which the summation is carried

out explicitly for the real number of electrons (N
is seen that substantial changes in intensity (and phase) occur over a time span τc,
but these quantities are reasonably constant over time intervals ∆t

≃

τc.

≪

Our technique utilizes the fact that, over the long probe pulse, time correlations
exist in the probe pulse intensity. It was shown that the femtosecond timescale
associated with intensity ﬂuctuations in synchrotron light pulses make them well
suited for time-resolved studies. The ﬁrst statistical quantity of interest is the vari-
ance of the detector counts. The statistics of concern are deﬁned over an ensemble
of synchrotron radiation pulses. From a set of variances measured as a function of
correlation time it is possible to reconstruct the femtosecond dynamical process.

2 The principle of pump-probe techniques based on the statistical

properties of synchrotron light

The shot noise in the electron beam causes ﬂuctuations of the beam density which
are random in time and space. As a result, the radiation, produced by such a beam,
has random amplitudes and phases in time and space. These kinds of radiation
ﬁelds can be described in terms of statistical optics, branch of optics that has been
developed intensively during the last few decades and there exists a lot of experience
and a theoretical basis for the description of ﬂuctuating electromagnetic ﬁelds [3,4].

We will begin in this section by dealing with some general notions of statistical
optics. Some of the statements will be quite precise, other only partially precise.
In the framework of statistical optics the radiation ﬁeld is characterized by notions
such as time and space coherence. Let us illustrate these notions. To be speciﬁc, we

consider the radiation pulse of nearly monochromatic radiation having a duration
1/∆ω, the radiation is
and bandwidth equal to T and ∆ω, respectively. If T
partially coherent in time. The time coherence is of about τc
1/∆ω. The physical
sense of this notion is as follows. Let us separate the radiation pulse by a splitter.
These two pulses pass diﬀerent path lengths and are then combined together. If
the diﬀerence between the path lengths is less than cτc, we see the interference
pattern at the end for a shot-to-shot averaging (averaging over a large number of
radiation pulses). Using simple physical language, we can say that the radiation
ﬁeld is correlated within the time of coherence.

≫

≃

The notion of space coherence can be explained in the same way. Let us direct the
radiation onto a screen with two pinholes and look at the interference pattern in

3

the far diﬀraction zone when changing the distance between the pinholes. When
the pinholes are located close to each other, we see a clear diﬀraction pattern. As
the distance between the holes increases to some value, D > ∆rc, we come to
the situation when we do not see an interference pattern after averaging over the
ensemble of pulses. Qualitatively, the value of π(∆rc)2 is referred as the area of
coherence of the radiation pulse. The coherence volume is deﬁned as the product of
the coherence area, π(∆rc)2, with the coherence length, cτc. If one uses the notions
of quantum mechanics, this volume corresponds to one cell in the phase space of the
photons. The number of photons in the coherence volume is also referred to as the
degeneracy parameter, δW. Physically this parameter means the average number
of photons which can interfere, or the number of photons in one quantum state
(one mode). It should be noted that third-generation synchrotron light sources can
produce soft X-ray radiation with very high degeneracy parameter and in such
cases we can state that the classical approach is adequate for a description of the
statistical properties of the synchrotron radiation.

Electron beam is composed of large number of electrons, thus ﬂuctuations always
exist in the electron beam density due to the eﬀect of shot noise. When the electron
beam enters the undulator, the presence of the beam modulation at frequencies close
to the resonance frequency initiates the process of radiation. The shot noise in the
electron beam is a Gaussian random process. The monochromator can be considered
as a linear ﬁlter which does not change the statistics of the signal. As a result, we can
deﬁne general statistical properties of the radiation after monochromator without
any calculations. For instance, the real and imaginary parts of the slowly varying
complex amplitudes of the electric ﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave have a Gaussian
distribution, the instantaneous radiation power ﬂuctuates in accordance with the
negative exponential distribution, and the energy in the radiation pulse ﬂuctuates
in accordance with the gamma distribution. We can also state that the spectral
density of the radiation energy and the ﬁrst-order time correlation function should
form a Fourier transform pair (this is so-called Wiener Khintchine theorem). Also,
the higher-order correlation functions (time and spectral) should be expressed in
terms of the ﬁrst-order correlation functions. These properties are well known in
statistical optics as properties of completely chaotic polarized radiation [4]. This
demonstrate one of the most beautiful things about statistical optics - how much
can be deduced from so little. This brings up an interesting question: Why is it
that the noise in the electron bunch is a Gaussian random process? We will give an
explanation in section 3.

The arrangement of components for a long probe pulse experiment is shown in Fig. 4.
In order to use the radiation from synchrotron light source it ﬁrst has to be spatially
ﬁltered and monochromatized. We assume that synchrotron radiation reaching the
sample surface has full transverse coherence. With this assumption, attention can
be concentrated completely on temporal coherence eﬀects. The coherence time of
synchrotron light is inversely proportional to the monochromator bandwidth. So
the narrower we make the monochromator exit slit, the wider the coherence time
gets. Any measurement of photodetector counts will be accompanied by certain
unavoidable ﬂuctuations and we wish to determine the statistical distribution of
the number of photocounts observed in any radiation pulse.

Now we wish to consider one example which shows the relationship between the
ﬂuctuations of photocounts and the coherence time in a circumstances that easy to
understand. We will not discuss applications of the proposed pump-probe scheme.
There are, in fact, many applications that could be discussed. We have chosen for
emphasis here experiments aimed at measuring the lifetime of electronic excitation
in condensed matter. For our present purposes we would like to imagine a somewhat
idealized experiment. Several assumptions are made about the process of internal
conversion of the electronic excitation. First, the time dependence of the electronic
occupation is assumed to be known a priory – this is the exponential dependence
n(t) = n0 exp(
t/τ0). In practice, this is a good assumption. The purpose of the
measurement is presumably to determine the lifetime τ0. The typical lifetime of
the electronic excitation is in the femtosecond range. This type of time-resolved
experiments may be understood as preparing an excited state with a pump pulse and
then projecting it with a probe pulse onto a ﬁnal state. The ﬁnal state should be well
characterized. Photoionization detection has several advantages. The ion state may
be well characterized by independent methods such as high resolution photoelectron
spectroscopy. Schematic ionization scheme for pump-probe ionization is illustrated
and
in Fig. 5. A typical experiment would be to couple two electronic state

The dynamics is then probed by ionization and detection of the photoelectrons
as a function of the coherence time of the probe synchrotron radiation pulse. A
time-resolved experiment inherently begins with the initiation of the process under
study, at some more or less accurately deﬁned instant in time. We assume that the
pump pulse can be approximated by a δ-function. With that simplifying assumption,
the number of photoelectrons K detected during a synchrotron radiation pulse is
directly proportional to the integrated value of the physical parameter (occupation
number) to be measured:

where I(t) is the instantaneous intensity of synchrotron radiation. At time t = 0
the pump pulse perturbs the sample. Here we assume that the pump-probe process
under consideration can be separated from what might be called parasitic processes.
In practice, not every count will be detected, and some false counts will register. We
are not considering such details because our interest is in the fundamental aspects
of the problem.

A quantity of considerable physical interest is the variance of the photocount dis-

electrons is to an excellent approximation, simply the product of the instantaneous

Within the scaling factor, therefore, the probability density function of K is approx-
imately the same as the density function of the instantaneous intensity. Using the
well-known results obtained in the framework of statistical optics, we can state that
when the lifetime is much shorter than the inverse of the monochromator bandwidth,
the variance tends to unity:

At the opposite extreme, with a lifetime much longer than the coherence time, the
fact that many independent ﬂuctuations of the instantaneous intensity occur within
the interval τ0 implies, according to the theory of completely chaotic light, that the
variance is inversely proportional to the monochromator bandwidth. So, we obtain

This relation is illustrated in Fig. 6, which shows the parameter σ−2
K plotted against
∆ωmτ0. The exact results can in fact be found for certain monochromator line
shapes using the formalism introduced in Section 2. The dependence of σ−2
K on the
exact shape of the signal and of the monochromator proﬁle is rather weak and can
be ignored outside the range 0.1 < ∆ωmτ0 < 10.

It is important to note that the photocount ﬂuctuations discussed above originate
from the shot noise in the electron beam. Nevertheless, the problem of photocount
ﬂuctuations is more complicated and there is another (parasitic) ﬂuctuation eﬀect
that can be important for the proposed pump-probe experiments. The problem is
the time jitter of electron bunch and pump pulse. Any measurement of photocounts
will be accompanied by these unavoidable ﬂuctuations. To solve this problem, fem-
tosecond pump pulses from the laser system should be synchronized to the master
clock of the storage ring rf system with phase-locking technique. At present the
best achievable synchronization between the optical laser and the synchrotron light
source is of the order of a few picoseconds. On the other hand the electron bunch
length is about of 100 ps. Assuming that the electron bunch envelope is Gaussian
distribution (in practice, this is a good assumption) we can ﬁnd that the parasitic
photocount variance reaches a value of about a per cent only. Thus we ﬁnd that

7

pump pulse jitter should not be a serious limitation in our case.

The next problem is to deﬁne the sensitivity of the proposed pump-probe method.
A general study of the noise ﬂuctuations associated with the photoevents would be
nontrivial. The diﬃculty arises in simultaneously including the eﬀects of both the
classically induced ﬂuctuations and Poisson noise ﬂuctuations associated with the
basic interaction of light and matter. The ratio of the classical variance to the ”pho-
ton noise” variance is named as a photocount degeneracy parameter δc (see section
4). Physically speaking, the count degeneracy parameter can be interpreted as the
average number of counts that occur in a single coherence interval of the incident
(transversely coherent) radiation. It can also be described as the average number of
1,
counts per ”degree of freedom” or per ”mode” of the incident wave. When δc
it is highly probable that there will be no more than one count per coherence inter-
val of the wave, with the result that quantum noise predominates over classically
induced noise. On the other hand, when δc
1, there are many photoevents pre-
sented in each coherence interval of the wave. The result is a ”bunching” of the
photoevents by the classical intensity ﬂuctuations, and an increase of the variance
of the counts to the point where the classically induced ﬂuctuations are far stronger
than the quantum noise variations.

≪

≫

Let us consider the case when the degeneracy parameter is much larger than unity,
δc
1. The ﬂuctuations of the photoevents are deﬁned mainly by the classical noise
in this case and the signal-to-noise ratio for the proposed device can be written in

ness. Our physical interpretation of the result (2) is as follows. In order to use the ra-
diation from the undulator it ﬁrst has to be spatially ﬁltered and monochromatized
(see Fig. 4). We interpret the factor Rmλ3Bpeak/(4c) as representing the number
of photons per coherence interval at the monochromator exit, whereas the factor
∆ωmτ0 represents a ratio of integration time τ0 to coherence interval τc
1/∆ωm.
Let us present a speciﬁc numerical example for the case of a third-generation syn-
chrotron light source. The spectral brightness delivered by an undulators at a wave-

As we mentioned above, the dependence of σ−2
K (τc) on the exact shape of the signal is
rather weak. As a result, the behaviour of the variance as a function of synchrotron
radiation coherence time provides only very little information on the sample dy-
namics. Nevertheless, the described pump-probe technique can be used to quote a
”characteristic time” of the sample dynamics. The typical procedure is to assume a
signal shape (generally exponential shape), and to ”determine” the relaxation time
τ0 from the known ratio between the τ0/τc and σ2
K.

A more complex instrument can be used to characterize the shape of the signal
function. The pump-probe technique based on a correlation principle we are describe
in section 7 is to use two spatially separated samples and record correlation of the
count ﬂuctuations for each value of the delay τ between two pump laser pulses.
Averaged (shot to shot) count product contains information about the shape of the
signal function. Another advantage of the correlator measurement is the possibility
to remove the monochromator between spatial ﬁlter and sample and thus to increase
the count degeneracy parameter.

3 Statistical properties of synchrotron radiation

The present section considers the statistical properties of the intensity ﬂuctuations
in synchrotron light. In order to give the subject a semblance of continuity, it will be
desirable to introduce considerable matter which will be found in any of standard
works on statistical optics. Much of the credit for stimulating modern development
in statistical analysis of synchrotron radiation is due to Professor’s Goodman book
[4], which laid the groundwork for the principles of pump-probe techniques based
on statistical properties of synchrotron light. Quite basic similarities between the
methods described here and the methods introduced into X-ray free electron laser
physics by authors in [5] should be recognized. We here consider the classical the-
ory of the ﬂuctuation experiment, reserving the quantum discussion for section 4,
where the theory of intensity ﬂuctuations is reconsidered in terms of the quantized
radiation ﬁeld.

3.1 Shot noise in the electron beam

In this subsection we study the statistical properties of the shot noise in the electron
beam. It should be noted that the process under study is nonstationary with ﬁnite
pulse duration, so in what follows the averaging symbol
means the ensemble
average over bunches.

h· · ·i

Let us consider the microscopic picture of the electron beam current at the en-
trance of the undulator. The electron beam current is made up of moving electrons

undulator entrance. The electron bunch proﬁle is described by the proﬁle function
F (t). The beam current averaged over an ensemble of bunches can be written in the
form:

For instance for an electron beam with Gaussian distribution of the current along
the beam, the proﬁle function is:

regarded as uniformly distributed on the interval (0, 2π). The formal summation of
the phasors is illustrated in Fig. 7. The calculation is an example of the ”random
walk” problem, well known in the theory of stochastic process. In this case we can
use the central limit theorem and conclude that the real part and the imaginary part

3.4 The origin of shot noise in the electron beam

Why is it that the noise in electron beam is a Gaussian random process? Why is
this the right rule, what is the fundamental reason for it, and how is it connected to
anything else? The explanation is deep down in quantum mechanics 1 . It is gener-
ally accepted that quantum mechanics provides the best current picture of physical
phenomena, and the most complete description of the radiation ﬁeld must be sought
in quantum-mechanical terms. The quantum theory of radiation predicts the exis-
tence of zero-point electromagnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst step is to show that a ﬁeld mode
is equivalent to harmonic oscillator. To describe a ﬁeld mode quantum mechani-
cally, we simply describe the equivalent harmonic oscillator quantum mechanically.
The vacuum state
has no photons, but predicts that it nevertheless has an en-
ergy ¯hω/2. From the probability distribution for a ground-state harmonic oscillator,
we easily obtain the probability distribution for the electric ﬁeld in vacuum state
. What is the physical signiﬁcance of these vacuum-state expectation values?

|
i
One thing they indicate is that the electromagnetic vacuum is a stationary state of
the ﬁeld with statistical ﬂuctuations of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. As far as
measurements are concerned, however, it is often argued that the entire universe is
evidently bathed in zero-point electromagnetic ﬁeld, which is distributed according
to a Gaussian probability distribution [6].

Relativistic electron beam passing through bending magnets emits synchrotron ra-
diation, a process that leads to damping. In standard classical electrodynamics there
is only the radiation reaction ﬁeld to act on a single particle in the vacuum. All six
degrees of freedom for electron motion in storage ring are damped and the actual
value of electron beam emittance would be equal to zero. We deduce the synchrotron
radiation formula using a classical treatment. So, the reasonable question arises of
whether such a classical model describes correctly the synchrotron radiation in the
storage ring. Simple physical considerations show that such a description is valid for
any practical situation. The classical electrodynamics approach can be used when
the energy of the radiated photon ¯hω is much less than the energy of the electron. As
a rule , ¯hω/(mc2γ)
10−5 and quantum eﬀects are negligible. Classically we gen-
erally assume implicitly that the homogeneous solution of the Maxwell equations is
that in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds vanish identically. That is, we assume
that there are no ﬁelds in the absence of any sources. In the absence of sources the
vacuum ﬁeld is simply zero, with no energy or ﬂuctuations whatsoever. This is not
to say that we cannot have source-free ﬁelds in classical electrodynamics. Rather,
the absence of zero-point ﬁelds in standard classical theory lies in the assumption
that there are no ﬁelds in the absence of any sources.

≃

We can go beyond standard classical theory and postulate the existence of zero-point
electric and magnetic ﬁelds in the absence of any sources. The diﬀerence between

and continue with subsection 3.5. Noise in electron beam is a Gaussian random
process. For the moment, reader will just have to take it as one of the rules of the

classical and quantum electrodynamics, together with the evident importance of the
ﬂuctuating vacuum ﬁeld in quantum electrodynamics, suggests the adoption of a
diﬀerent boundary conditions in classical electrodynamics: instead of assuming that
the classical ﬁeld vanishes in the absence of sources, we can assume that there is
a ﬂuctuating classical ﬁeld with zero energy ¯hω/2 per mode. As long as this ﬁeld
satisﬁes the Maxwell’s equations there is no a priori inconsistency in this assump-
tion. The appearance of ¯h in this modiﬁcation of classical electrodynamics implies
no deviation from conventional classical ideas, for ¯h is regarded as nothing more
than a number chosen to obtain consistency of the predictions of the theory with
experiment. The resulting theory is able to account quantum eﬀects within a fully
classical framework [6].

We note that electron storage rings have provided strong evidence for the reality of
zero-point energy. In the experiments with stored electrons the zero-point energy
sets a lower limit to freezing of the electron motion. If there were no noise associated
with the vacuum ﬁelds, the actual value of electron beam emittance would be equal
to zero. In storage rings damping will counteract quantum excitation leading to an
equilibrium. If one looks over the derivation of the quantum diﬀusion of the electrons
in the storage ring, it becomes clear that the argument can be couched in the
language of stochastic electrodynamics rather than quantum electrodynamics. That
is , all that is really required in that derivation is zero-point energy ¯hω/2 per mode of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Whether this zero-point energy is of quantum or classical
origin is irrelevant for the purpose of deriving the diﬀusion coeﬃcient - stochastic
electrodynamics accounts perfectly well for the quantum diﬀusion of electrons in
storage ring. In this case both the ﬁeld and the particles are treated classically and
we have no practical need in accelerator physics for quantum electrodynamics.

The diﬀusion terms will introduce a statistical mixing of the phases and after some
damping times any initial azimuthal variation of the phase space density will be
washed out. Electrons in a storage ring are evidently bathed in zero-point electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, which is distributed according to a Gaussian probability distribution.
This is the explanation of the relation between vacuum ﬂuctuations and shot noise
in the electron beam.

3.5 Analysis of synchrotron radiation properties in the frequency domain

Above we described the properties of the input shot noise signal in the frequency
domain. The next step is the derivation of the spectral function connecting the
Fourier amplitudes of the output ﬁeld and the Fourier amplitudes of the input
noise signal. In the ﬁrst analysis of the problem, we adopt some rather simplifying
assumptions that are only occasionally met in practice. Following this simpliﬁed
analysis, however, we show how the validity of the results can be extended to a far
wider range of conditions than might have been thought at the start.

We will investigate the synchrotron radiation in the framework of the one-dimensional
model. For simplicity we consider linear polarization of synchrotron radiation, and

14

use a scalar representation of the radiation ﬁeld. Nevertheless, all the results are
valid for any polarization. The one-dimensional model describes the radiation of the
plane electromagnetic wave

Ey(t) = ˜Ey(t) exp[i ω(z/c

t)] + C.C. ,

−

by the electron beam in the planar undulator. The electric ﬁeld of the electromag-
netic wave in the time domain, Ey(t), and its Fourier transform, ¯E(ω), are connected
by

Ey(t) =

¯E(ω)e− i ωt d ω .

1
2π

∞

Z−∞

When ω < 0 the Fourier harmonic is deﬁned by the relation ¯E∗(ω) = ¯E(
ω). The
Fourier harmonic of the transversely coherent electromagnetic ﬁeld at the spatial
ﬁlter exit and the Fourier harmonic of the current at the undulator entrance are
connected by the relation:

−

¯E(ω) = A(ω) ¯J (ω) , ω > 0 ,

(10)

where A(ω) is the spectral function of the undulator. For an undulator of Nw periods
each electron oscillates through Nw cycles of its motion and thus radiates a wavetrain
consisting of Nw cycles of the electric ﬁeld. The Fourier transform of this waveform
which gives the spectral content of the ﬁelds, is sin(x)/x, where x = Nwπ(∆ω/ω0)
and ∆ω = (ω
ω0) is the frequency shift away from the central maximum at ω0.
Thus we can write (see section 4):

−

A(ω)

|

2= A0
|

sin2(Nwπ∆ω/ω0)
(Nwπ∆ω/ω0)2

.

It is relevant to make some remarks on the region of applicability of the one-
dimensional theory. One-dimensional model assumes the input shot noise and out-
put radiation to have full transverse coherence. This assumption allow us to assume
that the input shot noise signal is deﬁned by the value of beam current (10). In
reality the ﬂuctuations of the electron beam current density are uncorrelated in the
transverse dimension. Using the notion of the beam radiation modes, we can say
that many transverse radiation modes are radiated when the electron beam enters
the undulator. The one-dimensional model can be used for the calculations of sta-
tistical properties of transversely coherent synchrotron radiation. In practice such
an assumption is valid for synchrotron light at the exit of a spatial ﬁlter. During the
spatial ﬁltering process, the number of transverse modes decreases, and the contri-
bution of the coherent radiation into the total radiation power is increased up to
full coherence. With this assumption, attention can be concentrated completely on
temporal coherence eﬀects.

Here we have used the simplest model of synchrotron light source with zero energy
spread into electron beam. In addition, it is assumed that the electrons move along
constrained sinusoidal trajectories in parallel with the undulator axis. The ﬁrst

15

assumption is primarily a statement that the energy spread, ∆γ/γ, is so small that
Nw∆γ/γ
1. Such a condition is generally valid in practice. The second assumption
is not generally valid in practice, but it will be removed in section 5.

≪

Above we studied the properties of the Fourier harmonics of the shot noise in the
frequency domain. The Fourier harmonics of the output radiation ﬁeld are connected
with the Fourier harmonics of the input shot noise by (10). It follows from (10) that
statistical properties of the Fourier amplitudes ¯E(ω) are deﬁned by the statistical
properties of the Fourier amplitudes of the input current ¯J(ω). In particular, it

For many practical applications of the synchrotron radiation a monochromator has
to be installed at the undulator exit. We denote the frequency proﬁle function of the
monochromator as Gm(ω). The linearity of Maxwell’s equations and the fact that
a monochromator can be treated as a linear ﬁlter allows one to write the Fourier
components of the electric ﬁeld of the synchrotron radiation in the following form:

¯E(ω) = A(ω)Gm(ω) ¯J (ω) ,

ω > 0 ,

Let us calculate the correlation of the complex Fourier harmonics ¯E(ω) and ¯E(ω′).
When the monochromator bandwidth is much less than the spectral bandwidth of
the undulator radiation we obtain:

3.6 Energy ﬂuctuation experiment

In this subsection we are going to discuss the application of statistical optics to
a practical device. We will ﬁnd that many of the features of this speciﬁc problem
are quite common in the general statistical theory of synchrotron light, and we will
learn a great deal by considering this one problem in detail.

Figure 8 shows the ﬂuctuation experiment geometry under consideration. The prob-
lem is a description of the ﬂuctuations of the energy of the radiation pulse W at
the detector installed after the spatial ﬁlter and monochromator. The experiment
is here analyzed in some detail to determine the conditions under which the ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations, resulting from the chaotic nature of the light source, aﬀect the energy
ﬂuctuations. Note that in this experiment, both monochromator resolution and ra-
diation pulse duration play a role. There is no X-ray monochromator providing the
λ2/c∆λ comparable with radiation pulse duration (100 ps).
coherence time τc
The model experiment ignores these technical limitations.

Using the expression for Poynting’s vector and Parseval’s theorem, we calculate the

The analysis of this expression shows that the variance of the energy distribution
after the monochromator is a function of the frequency proﬁle of the monochroma-

18

tor, of the frequency proﬁle of the undulator, and of the electron bunch formfactor
¯F (ω

Let us consider the case of an electron bunch with a Gaussian proﬁle and a monochro-
mator with a rectangular line:

For simplicity we assume that the bandwidth of the monochromator is small and
A(ω) is constant within the monochromator bandwidth. Then the integration of the
expression (24) provides the following result:

where erf(x) is the error function and ∆ωc is given by expression (19).

Let us study the asymptotic behavior of (25). When the monochromator bandwidth
is much less than the interval of spectral coherence, the normalized dispersion tends
to unity:

σ2
W ≃

When the monochromator bandwidth is much larger than the interval of spectral
coherence, the variance is inversely proportional to the monochromator bandwidth:

≪

The next practical problem is to ﬁnd the probability density distribution of the
radiation energy after the monochromator, p(W ). Using the well-known results ob-
tained in the framework of statistical optics, we can state that the distribution of the
radiation energy after the monochromator is described rather well by the gamma
probability density function:

p(W ) =

The parameter M can be interpreted as the average number of degrees of freedom
(or modes) in the radiation pulse. It follows from (24) that this parameter cannot be

less than unity. When M tends to the unity, (26) tends to the negative exponential
distribution (11). For large values of M the distribution (26) tends to a Gaussian
distribution.

3.7 Analysis of the radiation properties in the time domain

An expression for the electric ﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave as a function of time
t can be obtained using the Fourier transform of (12). It is convenient to isolate
explicitly the slowly varying complex amplitude:

Ey(t) = ˜E(t)e− i ω0t + C.C. ,

where

˜E(t)e− i ω0t =

The analysis of the obtained relations (30) and (41) shows that the synchrotron
radiation possesses all the features of completely chaotic polarized light (see also
(11) and (21) obtained in the frequency domain).

3.8 Statistical properties of the integrated intensity

In a variety of problems, related with photon-counting statistics, ﬁnite-time integrals
of instantaneous intensity occur. In many cases the ﬂuctuations in the intensity
are too rapid for direct observation, and what is measured is some average of the
ﬂuctuations over detector response time. The calculation can be performed without
great diﬃculty in two limiting cases, namely, the response time very long and very
short compared with the electron pulse duration. In section 3.6 we discussed in
detail ﬂuctuations of the energy of the radiation pulse at the slow detector installed
after the monochromator (see Fig. 5). Note that for this class of experiments we
actually assume that the integration time is much longer than the electron pulse
duration.

Next let us consider the opposite extreme. For our simpliﬁed discussion here let us
assume that the integration time is much shorter than the electron pulse duration,
leaving the electron pulse envelope unaﬀected. There is no photodetector providing
a time resolution much shorter than the X-ray pulse duration. Present-day X-ray de-
tection will be limited in time resolution of about 100 ps. The situation is somewhat
diﬀerent in pump-probe experiments. A pump-probe experiment has analogies with
a femtosecond photodetector measurement. The basic analogy is that a femtosec-
ond pump pulse interacts with the sample and excites it into non-equilibrium state.
The sample thereafter relaxes towards a new equilibrium state. Typical relaxation
times are in the femtosecond range. This process can be mapped by sending a X-
ray probe pulse onto the sample. Such a device could be discussed as a femtosecond
X-ray detector by recording a secondary process such as photoelectrons.

Several assumptions are made about the proﬁle of the photodetector gating function.
For the present, consideration is restricted to the simplest case from the analytical
point of view, namely, completely chaotic polarized radiation and an ideal detector
with a stepped proﬁle gating function. So, the next problem is the description of

23

the ﬂuctuations of the radiation energy W detected during a ﬁnite time interval δT :

It can be shown that the integrated intensity distribution is described rather well
by the gamma probability density function (21) with parameter M equal to σ−2
W .
When δT is less than the coherence time τc (36), the parameter M tends to unity
and the gamma distribution tends to the negative exponential distribution. In the
opposite case, when δT

τc, we can write:

M −1 =

and the gamma distribution tends to a Gaussian distribution.

In some experiments, such as one in which a long probe pulse is being used to
measure lifetime of internal conversion of electronic excitation, the photocount time
dependence is exponential dependence. In this case the detector gating function is
an exponential function and the variance is calculated as follows:

Our discussion of integrated intensity ﬂuctuations would be incomplete if we did not
refer the reader to another method of calculation. The sample dynamics is in the
femtosecond range and
= const. is a good assumption. Clearly, we can assume
that the synchrotron light in question is adequately modelled as an ergodic and
hence stationary random process. Surely the preferred way to solve the problem of
integrated intensity ﬂuctuations must be stationary random process way. Although
the origins of the above viewpoint are quite clear and understandable, the conclu-
sions reached regarding the relative merits of stationary and nonstationary analysis
are very greatly in error, for several important reasons.

i

The second method of calculation has the advantage of conceptual simplicity but
the disadvantage of being not quite as general as the ﬁrst method. In defence of
our nonstationary analysis we must say that models constructed for nonstationary
analysis are inherently more general and ﬂexible. Indeed, they invariably contain

25

the model of a stationary random process as a special case. In the normal course of
events, a physicist ﬁrst encounters statistical optics in an entirely stationary random
process framework. In this case correlation functions in the frequency domain are
represented by delta functions. The physicists emerging from such an introductory
course may feel conﬁdent that they have grasped the basic statistical optics concepts
and are ready to ﬁnd a precise answer to almost any problem that comes their way.
Nevertheless, there is no diﬃculty in compiling a long list of examples for which an
analysis of nonstationary random processes is required.

The nonstationary random process approach is needed somewhat more complex
than the stationary random process approach, for it requires knowledge of the sta-
tistical properties of synchrotron radiation not only in the time domain but also in
the frequency domain. In the long run, however, the nonstationary random process
model is far more powerful and useful than the stationary random process model in
solving physical problems of practical interest.

4 Photocount ﬂuctuations in the detector of synchrotron radiation

Almost all devices that measure the intensity of a light beam depend for their op-
eration on the absorption of a portion of the beam, whose energy is converted to
a detectable form. The photographic plate, the photomultiplier tube, and ioniza-
tion and detection of photoelectrons in pump-probe experiments all fall into this
category. The present section therefore considers the absorption of light in more
detail in order to understand the nature of the intensity measurement process. It
is convenient to base the discussion on a practical intensity-measuring device, and
we select the photodetector. The photodetector depends for its operation on the
photoelectric eﬀect. Since the vast majority of pump-probe detection problems do
indeed rest on the photoelectric eﬀect, there is relatively little loss of generality by
making this assumption.

Consider a storage ring synchrotron light source. The light from this source falls on
the photosurface, and we wish to determine the statistical distribution of the number
of photoevents observed in any radiation pulse. Any measurement of light will be
accompanied by certain unavoidable ﬂuctuations. We attribute these ﬂuctuations to
quantum eﬀects; that is, light can be absorbed only in quanta. We shall deal with the
so-called semiclassical theory of photodetection. Such an approach has the beneﬁt
of being comparatively simple in terms of the mathematical background required, as
well as allowing a greater use of physical intuition. The distinguishing characteristic
of this formalism is the fact that electromagnetic ﬁelds are treated in a completely
classical manner until they interact with the atoms of the photosensitive material
on which they are incident. Thus there is no necessity to deal with quantization
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld; only the interaction of the classical ﬁeld and matter is
quantized. Fortunately it has been shown that the predictions of the semiclassical
theory are in complete agreement wit the predictions of the more rigorous quantum
mechanical approach for all detection problems involving the photoelectric eﬀect

26

[4].

We assume that the radiation reaching the detector has full transverse coherence
and that the statistical properties of the radiation follow the laws described in the
previous section. It has been shown above that the energy, W , in the radiation pulse
is unpredictable. Thus, we can predict the probability density p(W ) only. In this
case the probability of detection of K photons is given by Mandel’s semiclassical
formula [4]:

P (K) =

where α = η/¯hω0 and η is the quantum eﬃciency of the photodetector. It should
be noted that, when conditioned by knowledge of energy W , the number of counts
K is a Poisson variable with mean αW . Using formula (46) we get the expression
for the mean and for the variance of the value of K:

where σ2
W = 1/M is given by the expression (24). The expression for photocount
ﬂuctuations contains two terms. The ﬁrst term corresponds to the photon ”shot
noise” and its origin is in the Poisson distribution. The second term corresponds to
the classical ﬂuctuations of the energy in the radiation bunch and takes its origin
from the shot noise in the electron bunch. The ratio of the classical variance to the
”photon shot noise” variance is named as a photocount degeneracy parameter δc:

The probability density of the integrated synchrotron radiation intensity, p(W ), is
the gamma distribution. Substituting (26) into Mandel’s formula (46) and perform-

5 Characteristics of undulator radiation

K
h

For the proposed concept of time-resolved experiments based on the statistical prop-
erties, the critical parameter determining the performance is the count degeneracy
parameter, or the average number of photoevents produced in a single coherence in-
terval of the incident radiation. The important role of this parameter is emphasized
by giving it a name of its own. Because the count degeneracy parameter is propor-
tional to
, it is also proportional to the quantum eﬃciency of the photosurface.
i
Sometimes it is useful to remove this dependence on the characteristics of the par-
ticular detector that may be present, and to deal with a degeneracy parameter that
is a property of the synchrotron light itself. We thus deﬁne the wave degeneracy
parameter as δW = δc/η. This new degeneracy parameter may be considered to
be the count degeneracy parameter that would be obtained with an ideal detector
having a quantum eﬃciency of unity. The wave degeneracy parameter is simply the
average number of photons per mode.

In this section we are particularly concerned about the wave degeneracy parameter.
λ3Bpeak/(4c),
From this section we will see that the degeneracy parameter is δW
where Bpeak is the peak spectral brightness of the radiation source. Third-generation
synchrotron light sources achieve high spectral brightness through very low-emittance
electron beams and by inserting into the electron beam a device known as an undu-
lator. The undulator causes the electron beam to undulate or bend back and forth,
and this produces very bright and coherent light.

5.1 Number of photons radiated in the central radiation cone

Let us introduce the basic features of undulator radiation. The undulator equation

tells us the frequency of radiation as a function of undulator period λw = 2πkw,
undulator parameter Kw, electron energy m0c2γ, and polar angle of observation θ.

Here ω0 = 2γ2kw/(1 + K 2
J1(Q)],
where Jn is the Bessel function of nth order, and Q = K 2
w). Now we
would like to calculate the energy radiated into the central cone. In the small-angle
approximation the solid angle is equal to d Ω = θ d θ d ϕ. Integration of spectral and
angular density over ω and ϕ gives us factors ω0/Nw and 2π, respectively. We also
have to integrate over θ from 0 to θcen. Thus, the energy radiated into the central
cone by a single electron is given by

Individual positions of electrons in the bunch are random, thus the radiated ﬁelds
due to diﬀerent electrons are uncorrelated, and the average energy radiated by the
bunch is a simple sum of the radiated energy from the individual electrons.

Beyond the natural broadening, due to the ﬁnite number Nw of oscillations, further
spectral broadening can be incurred with the passage of many electrons through the
undulator in a bunch of ﬁnite size, divergence, and energy spread [8]. If there is an
electron energy (rms) spread within the bunch, ∆γ/γ, there will be a corresponding
photon energy spread given by ∆Eph/Eph = 2∆γ/γ, where the factor of two is
due to the square relationship between photon energy and electron energy. A more
signiﬁcant eﬀect is that due to angular distribution within the bunch. As a result,
some electrons traverse the undulator not along or parallel to the z-axis, but at
a small angle θx,y. These electrons undergo the same number Nw of oscillations,
but experience a somewhat longer period λw/ cos(θx,y). If there is an rms angular
divergence σ′ within the bunch, there will be a corresponding photon energy spread
given by ∆Eph/Eph = γ2(σ′)2/(1 + K 2
w/2). In what follows we use the following
assumption:

When these conditions are satisﬁed, the energy spread and angular divergence cause
a spectral broadening less than 1/Nw and the central cone will be rather well deﬁned
in terms of both its angular deﬁnition and spectrum.

To complete the calculation of the undulator characteristics an expression is needed
for the photon ﬂux within the central cone. We divide the radiated energy by the
energy per photon ¯hω0, and obtain

5.2 Spectral brightness of undulator radiation

deﬁned as the density of photons in the six-dimensional phase space volume [7]:

where σx,y and (σx,y)′ are the (horizontal and vertical) photon beam Gaussian
(1/√e) radius and Gaussian half angle respectively. In the case of ﬁnite particle
beam emittance the photon brightness is reduced. The amount of reduction, how-
ever, depends on the matching to the photon beam. The particle beam parameters
are

(σe)2

x,y = (ǫe)x,yβx,y ,

(σ′

e)2

x,y = (ǫe)x,y/βx,y ,

where βx,y is the betatron function in the undulator, ǫx,y is the horizontal and
vertical electron beam emittance, respectively. To modify the expression for spectral
brightness for the case of undulator radiation, we can use the previously calculated
photon ﬂux in the central radiation cone, d Ncen/ d t, which was deﬁned as having
a relative spectral bandwidth (BW) of ∆ω/ω0 = 1/Nw (under condition (51)) and
radiation cone of half angle θcen. Taking into account the contribution of diﬀraction
eﬀects, we may wright the following expressions for the size and angular divergence
of the photon beam:

dulator length [7]. It is frequently used in the synchrotron radiation community to
p
express the spectral brightness in terms of relative spectral bandwidth of 10−3. The
expression for B in terms of photon ﬂux within the central cone is [8]:

5.3 Spatial and spectral ﬁltering of undulator radiation

Our previous discussion assumed that the synchrotron light striking the photosur-
face was completely coherent in a spatial sense. In such a case the number of degrees
of freedom M is determined strictly by temporal eﬀects. When the wave is not spa-
tially coherent, its spatial structure can aﬀect the number of degrees of freedom; at

30

Fig. 10. Undulator radiation with a pinhole spatial ﬁlter

any given time, diﬀerent parts of the photosensitive surface may experience diﬀerent
levels of incident intensity. One of the way to overcome this problem is based on
the idea to use a spatial ﬁlter. This possibility to create spatially coherent radia-
tion is important for many experiments speciﬁcally for our scheme for time-resolved
experiments and we will discuss in more detail the conditions for the synchrotron
light source to emit such radiation.

As an example of pinhole spatial ﬁltering, Fig. 10 illustrates how the technique
is used to obtain spatially coherent radiation from a periodic undulator [8]. The
limiting condition of spatially coherent radiation is a space-angle product d
θ =
λ/(2π), where d is a Gaussian 1/√e diameter and θ is the Gaussian half angle [8].
In general the phase space volume of photons in the central radiation cone is larger
than the limiting condition required for spatial coherence. Thus, for experiments
that require spatial coherence, a pinhole and angular acceptance aperture are to be
introduced. This pinhole spatial ﬁlter is used to narrow, or ﬁlter, the phase space
of transmitted radiation. Filtering to d
θ = λ/(2π) requires the use of both a small
·
pinhole (d), and some limitation on θ, such that the product is equal to λ/(2π).

a downstream diaphragm of aperture d = 2σd is used for selection of the transversely

These remarks may be useful in estimating the conditions under which a spatially

5.4 Discussion of spatial coherence

The spatial coherence in a light beam generally has to do with the coherence between
two points in the ﬁeld illuminated by light source. The meaning of spatial coherence
can best be understood with the help of Young’s two-pinhole experiment (see Fig.
11). In its elementary sense, the degree of coherence between the two points simply
describes the contrast of the interference fringes that are obtained when the two
points are taken as secondary sources. Let a source S illuminate the two pinholes
S1 and S2, as shown in Fig. 11. The source is perfectly noncoherent. That is to say,
no interference fringes can be obtained by placing two pinholes in the plane of the
source. It was shown, however, that if the two slits are placed far enough away from
the noncoherent source, interference fringes of good contrast can be obtained (see
Fig. 12). It is sometimes said that the spatial coherence in light beams increases
with distance ”by mere propagation”. It would be nice to ﬁnd an explanation which
is elementary in the sense that we can see what is happening physically.

Suppose that a quasimonochromatic wave is incident on an aperture in an opaque

32

Fig. 12. Interference-fringe amplitude, in Young’s interferometer, for three values of
noncoherent source-pinhole screen distance

Fig. 13. Geometry for propagation of spatial coherence

screen, as illustrated in Fig. 13. In general, this wave may be partially coherent.
The detailed structure of an optical wave undergoes changes at the wave prop-
agates through space. In a similar fashion, the detailed structure of the spatial
coherence undergoes changes, and in this sense the transverse coherence function is
said to propagate. Knowing the spatial coherence on the aperture, we wish to ﬁnd
the spatial coherence on the observing screen at distance z beyond the aperture.
Synchrotron radiation is a stochastic object and for any synchrotron light beam
there exist some characteristic linear dimension, ∆rc, which determines the scale of
spatially random ﬂuctuations. Fig. 13 illustrates the type of spiky speckle pattern
on an aperture in an opaque screen. When ∆rc
d, the radiation beyond the aper-
ture is partially coherent. This case is shown in Fig. 13. Here ∆rc may be estimated
as the typical linear dimension of speckles.

≪

First we wish to calculate the (instantaneous) intensity distribution observed across

33

Fig. 14. Reciprocal width relations of Fourier transform pairs

a parallel plane at distance z beyond the aperture. The observed intensity distri-
bution can be found from a two-dimensional Fourier transform of the ﬁeld. The
radiation ﬁeld across the aperture may be presented as a superposition of plane
waves, all with the same wavenumber k = ω0/c. The value of k⊥/k gives the sine
of the angle between the z axis and the direction of propagation of the plane wave.
In the paraxial approximation k⊥/k = sin θ
θ. If the radiation beyond the aper-
ture is partially coherent, a spiky angular spectrum is expected. The nature of the
spikes in the angular spectrum is easily described in Fourier-transform notations.
We can expect that the typical width of the angular spectrum envelope should be
of the order of (k∆rc)−1. Also an angular spectrum of the source having transverse
size d should contain spikes with a typical width of about (kd)−1, a consequence
of the reciprocal width relations of Fourier transform pairs (see Fig. 14). It is the
source linear dimension d that determines the coherent area of the observed wave
z/(kd), but in addition the coherence linear dimension ∆rc of the source inﬂuences
the distribution of average intensity over the observing screen with typical width
z/(k∆rc). Thus, if the screen is placed far enough away from the noncoherent source,
z

d∆rc/λ, a coherence area of large linear dimension can be obtained.

5.5 Grating monochromator considered as a spatial ﬁlter

In order to use the radiation from the source it ﬁrst has to be ﬁltered and monochro-
matized. Finally, to be complete, we should remark that in the experimental ar-
rangement shown in Fig. 4 there is still one other eﬀect which gives spatial ﬁltering.
A monochromator is just a spatial ﬁlter working in dispersive direction only. We
would like to show next how it is that a monochromator can act like a spatial ﬁlter.
Figure 15 shows the grating geometry under consideration. The ﬁnite size of the
entrance and exit slits in the dispersive direction sets a limit to the achievable res-
olution. The slit-width-limited resolution can be obtained directly from the grating
equation. In particular, the entrance slit-width-limited resolution is given by [9]:

∆λ = zd cos(α)/(nm) ,

Fig. 15. Illustration of grating monochromator. The ﬁnite size of the entrance slit
in the dispersive direction sets a limit to the achievable resolution

where α is the angle of incidence, Ng is the number of lines on the grating, D is
the width of grating, n = Ng/D is the line density, m is the order of the diﬀraction
pattern, d is the width of entrance slit, z is the entrance slit-grating distance. We
see that the resolution is equal to

λ
∆λ

=

zmNgλ
Dd cos(α)

.

The coeﬃcient (mNg)−1 is just the minimal uncertainty in the wavelength that
can be measured with the given grating. The coeﬃcient of proportionality between
λ/∆λ and mNg is zλ/[Dd cos(α)]. What does all this mean? This is an example in
which transverse coherence plays an important role. The ability to spectrally ﬁlter
radiation by a monochromator requires well-deﬁned phase and amplitude variations
of the ﬁelds across the grating. So in order that we shall have a sharp line in
our spectrum corresponding to a deﬁnite wavelength with an uncertainty given by
(mNg)−1, we have to have a wave transverse coherence area of at least the size
D cos(α). If the transverse coherence area is too small we are not using the entire
grating. Suppose we have an entrance slit with aperture d and send a beam of
radiation at the grating with an aperture D cos(α). The radiation reaching the
grating is transversely coherent when the following condition for the space-angle
product is fulﬁlled:

d

θ = Dd cos(α)/(2z)

λ/(2π) .

·

≃

We expect that only for pure transverse coherence, the grating will work right and
the resolution λ/∆λ and mNg will be nearly equal. Importantly, in our scheme that
incorporates an external pinhole spatial ﬁlter (see Fig. 4), the monochromator does
not require an entrance slit.

5.6 Wave degeneracy parameter of undulator radiation

Physically the wave degeneracy parameter describes the average number of photons
which can interfere, or, according to quantum theory, the number of photons in one
quantum state (one ”mode”). We shall deal with two diﬀerent approaches to the
calculation of the wave degeneracy parameter. First we consider what can reasonably
called ”ﬂuctuation experiments in the frequency domain” (see subsection 3.6). For
the frequency domain we use the notion of the wave degeneracy parameter δW
which is equal to the average number of transversely coherent photons radiated
by the electron bunch inside the spectral interval of coherence ∆ωc. Taking into
account that the ”emittance” of the diﬀraction limited photon beam is equal to

we calculate the average number of spatially coherent photons radiated within one
pulse into the spectral interval of ∆λ/λ:

where B(t) is the instantaneous spectral brightness of the synchrotron radiation.
The value of ∆λ/λ is connected with the interval of the spectral coherence by the
relation: ∆λ/λ = ∆ωc/ω0. Using (16), (18) and Parseval’s theorem we obtain:

is a reasonable approximation. Finally, the degeneracy parameter can be estimated
simply as:

(52)

What about the other kinds of ﬂuctuation experiments, for example, integrated
intensity ﬂuctuations? For the time domain we use the notion of the wave degeneracy
parameter δW which is equal to the average number of transversely coherent photons
radiated by the electron bunch during the coherence time τc:

(∆Nph)coh =

(τcBpeak) .

Finally, the product τc∆λ/λ is given by the expression

τc∆λ/λ = A′λ/c .

The dependence of the factor A′ on the exact shape of the spectral distribution
is rather weak. Let us consider the speciﬁc case of a Gaussian line proﬁle. The
explicit expression for the coherence time is τc = √π/σm. The FWHM bandwidth
would be ∆λ/λ = 2.36(σm/ω) giving, for A′ = 0.7. Thus A′
1 is a reasonable
approximation and the wave degeneracy parameter δW is given by the expression
(52). The frequency domain calculations and time domain calculations give similar
results.

≃

Let us present a speciﬁc numerical example for the case of a third-generation syn-
chrotron light source. The peak spectral brightness at a wavelength of 10 nm is
equal to

Bpeak

1021

≃

photons/s
mm2mrad2(0.1%BW)

.

Substituting this number into (52) we obtain that the wave degeneracy parameter is
103. Hence in the soft X-ray region of the spectrum we expect classically
about δW
induced ﬂuctuations of photocounts to have a far stronger eﬀect than pure quantum
shot noise ﬂuctuations. On the other hand, in the hard X-ray region of the spectrum
(λ

0.1 nm), a source brightness in excess of

≃

≃

Bpeak

1024

≃

photons/s
mm2mrad2(0.1%BW)

is required to produce a wave degeneracy parameter greater than unity. Since third-
generation sources have a peak brightness of only this value, we can conclude that in
this region of the spectrum, the vast majority of third-generation synchrotron light
sources encountered produce radiation with wave degeneracy parameters compara-
ble with unity, and hence noise produced by the quantized nature of the radiation
is comparable with the noise produced by classical ﬂuctuations of the intensity.

37

A few additional comments are needed in closing this section. We have concen-
trated our attention on the wave degeneracy parameter, which is a property of the
synchrotron radiation falling on the photodetector. That photodetector invariably
has a quantum eﬃciency that is less than unity. In addition, the eﬃciency of the
monochromator is less than unity, too. Hence the count degeneracy parameter will
be even smaller than the wave degeneracy parameter. When the integration time is
large, τ0

τc, the parameter δc is given by:

≫

δc = ηRmδW .

δc

where Rm is the monochromator throughput. In the opposite case, at τ0
parameter δc is about

≪

τc, the

In addition, it is possible that the sample or collecting optics may intercept only a
fraction of one spatial mode from the source. In such a case the count degeneracy
parameter may again be smaller than the wave degeneracy parameter, as a result
of the incomplete capture of a spatial mode. Although the minimum value of M
is unity, the reduction of the energy striking the detector surface must be taken
into account. In such a case, the count degeneracy parameter must be reduced from
the normal value by a factor of the ratio of the eﬀective measurement area to the
coherence area of the incident light.

6 The signal-to-noise ratio associated with the output of the mea-
surement system assumed for the pump-probe experiments

The principle of operation of the proposed pump-probe scheme is based essentially
on the classical intensity ﬂuctuations of synchrotron radiation. It is shown above
that stochastic ﬂuctuations of the classical intensity can inﬂuence the statistical
properties of the photoevents that are observed. Note in particular that the variance
σ2
K of K consists of two distinct terms, each of which has a physical interpretation:

(53)

The ﬁrst term is simply the variance of the counts that would be observed if the
classical intensity were constant and the photocounts were purely Poisson. We re-
fer to this contribution to the count ﬂuctuations as ”quantum noise”. The second
term, σ2
W, is clearly zero if there are no ﬂuctuations of the classical intensity. For
instance, in the case of laser light, this component would be identically zero, and
the count variance would be simply that arising from Poisson-distributed counts.
When synchrotron light is incident on the sample surface, the classical ﬂuctuations
are nonzero, and the variance of the photocounts is larger than that expected for
a Poisson distribution by an amount that is proportional to the variance of the in-
tegrated intensity. This extra component of variance of the counts is often referred

38

to as ”excess noise,” meaning that it is above and beyond that expected for pure
Poisson ﬂuctuations [4].

Our initial goal was to ﬁnd expressions for the classical variance σ2
W of the integrated
intensity. Also of major interest is the signal-to-noise ratio, associated with the
variance, which provides us with an indication of the magnitude of the ﬂuctuations
of classical variance relative to the expectation value. The general approach to
calculating the output signal-to-noise ratio of the proposed device will be as follows.
Following subtraction of the
associated with the quantum noise (see (53)), the
signal-to-noise ratio takes the form 2

where σ2
W is calculated using (45), Nshot is the number of independent measurements
averaged in the accumulator (total number of shots). The only requirement for the
accuracy of this procedure is that the count ﬂuctuations be uncorrelated from shot
to shot, a property that does hold in our case.

A fully general study of the signal-to-noise ratio would be nontrivial. The diﬃculty
arises in simultaneously including the eﬀects on that noise of both the classically
induced ﬂuctuations and Poisson ﬂuctuations of the counts. The full analysis, in-
cluding both of these eﬀects, is a diﬃcult analytical problem. The calculation can be
performed without great diﬃculty in two limiting cases, namely, the cases of degen-
eracy parameter very large and very small compared with 1. When δc
1, there
are many photoevents present in each coherence interval of the wave. The result
is a ”bunching” of the photoevents by the classical intensity ﬂuctuations, and an
increase of the variance of the counts to the point where the classically induced ﬂuc-
tuations are far stronger than the quantum noise variations. When the degeneracy
parameter is much larger than 1, the expression (54) can be replaced by

Our consideration is restricted to the two simplest cases from the analytical point
of view, namely, the cases of integration time τ0 very short and very long com-
pared with the coherence time. For short integration time, the value of the incident
intensity I(t) is approximately constant over the entire counting interval. As a con-
sequence, the integrated intensity W is distributed in accordance with the negative

exponential distribution (30). It follows that the

We know that for the case when δc

dominated by pure quantum noise. Thus the probability of obtaining K counts is,
to a good approximation, given by the Poisson distribution. We cannot neglect the
classically induced ﬂuctuations of the counts when we calculate the signal compo-
nent of the output, but we can neglect them when we calculate the noise, simply
because their contribution to the noise is so small. For the ﬁnal approximation we
note that if the integration time τ0 is very short compared with the coherence time,
the expression for the photocounts degeneracy parameter is equal to the average
number of detected photoelectrons per pulse δc

7 Pump-probe technique based on a correlation principle

A more complex instrument can be used to characterize the shape of the signal
function. The technique we are to describe here is to use two spatially separated

ations

samples and record correlation of the count ﬂuctuations for each value of the delay τ
between two pump laser pulses. The new conﬁguration is sketched in Fig. 16. In this
case the transversely coherent probe X-ray beam is splitting and incidents on two
spatially separated samples. The detected photoevents are than correlated, and the
sample dynamics is determined from that correlation. Each detector is connected
with a separate electronic counter. The version of apparatus for measurement of
average count product depicted in Fig. 17. During one radiation pulse, each of
two detectors registers K1 and K2 number of photocounts, respectively. After each
shot, an electronic scheme multiplies these numbers and passes this product to an
averaging accumulator, where it is added to the previously stored sum of count
products. Finally, the total sum is divided by the number of shots. This result,
, contains information about the

averaged (shot to shot) count product

shape of the signal function. Another advantage of the correlator measurement is
the possibility to remove the monochromator between spatial ﬁlter and sample and
thus to increase the count degeneracy parameter.

Now our goal is to ﬁnd the relationship between the expected value of the average
count product and the sample dynamics. In addition, we wish to ﬁnd the variance

41

of this quantity, so that the signal-to-noise ratio associated with the measurement
can be determined and compared with the similar quantities found in the previous
section.

7.1 The expected value of the count-ﬂuctuation product and its relationship

to the sample dynamics

By the ”count ﬂuctuations” we mean explicitly the diﬀerence between the actual
numbers of counts obtained in one shot at detector 1 and 2 and the expected values
of these two number counts. Thus

tion is always a symmetric function. The Fourier transform of the autocorrelation
is a real function, consistent with a symmetric function in the time domain. The
question then naturally arises as to exactly what information about f (t) can be
derived from the measurement of cross-correlation (see Fig. 18). One can see that
the proposed correlation technique provides the possibility to measure the modulus
of the Fourier transform of the signal function, while information about its phase is

¯f (ω)

missing. To provide reconstruction of the signal function from the autocorrelation
function a special iterative technique should be used. Clearly, without loss of gen-
erality, we can assume that the signal function describing the sample dynamics is
zero for t < 0 and nonzero for t > 0. Additionally we know that at t = 0 the signal
function is maximum. These relationships help us with the task at hand, namely
determining the phase of ¯f (ω) from the knowledge of its modulus in the majority of
cases involving functions f (t) of considerable complexity. Nonetheless, it is possible
to ﬁnd cases in which ambiguities exist.

Let us analyse the signal-to-noise ratio taking into account the quantum eﬀects.
When calculating the signal component (numerator of (61)), we can take into ac-
count classically induced ﬂuctuations of the counts only. This can be done due to the
fact that the quantum ﬂuctuations of the counts at the outputs of two detectors are
statistically independent. General calculations of the noise ﬂuctuations associated
with the output of the correlation apparatus (denominator of (61)) should include
both the classical and the quantum eﬀects. Taking into account these considerations
we can derive the following relations:

The analysis of the obtained asymptotic expressions (64) and (67) for the signal-to-
noise ratio allows one to make the following conclusions:

(i) The signal-to-noise ratio depends on the degeneracy parameter only when δc is
much less that 1. In this case the number of independent measurements for a given
signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to (1/δc)2.

(ii) The signal-to-noise ratio is proportional to An(τ ). To hold the signal-to-noise
ratio constant, the number of independent measurements must be proportional to
A−2

n (τ ).

7.3 Other autocorrelation techniques

There are other techniques to provide the possibility to measure the integrated
intensity autocorrelation. They diﬀer from each other in the beam splitters, the
delay line and the detection system. We will now describe two new approaches. An
alternative technique to generate An(τ ) is to use one pump beam and two probe
beams. In the setup shown in Fig. 19 the pump pulse perturbs the sample at time
t = 0. A long X-ray pulse passes a beam splitter, generating two pulses travelling
diﬀerent paths. After the two paths are recombined, the two pulses impinge on the
sample at a time diﬀerence τ which can be varied. The photocounts are recorded
by a detector and the variance σ2

K is studied as a function of τ .

Now we describe the basic principles of autocorrelation measurement with this ar-
rangement. In the limit of a large photocount degeneracy parameter the expression

for the variance of counts reduces to the form (

has thus a peak to background of 2 to 1. The measurement leading to σ2
W(τ ) we can
refer to as the integrated intensities autocorrelation with background, as opposed to
the background free autocorrelation described in the previous subsection (see Fig.
16).

The most important and critical area of R&D for time-resolved experiments utilizing
the autocorrelator will be the development of X-ray beam splitters and delay lines.
Considerable work will need to be undertaken to make them routinely used optical
elements.

The technique to use two probe X-ray beams that are generated by the same electron
bunch but from two insertion devices (again with one beam delayed with respect
to the other) may be a more promising approach. The concept is very interesting
in view of the critical synchronization of probe beams (see Fig. 20). Using this
technique precisely controlled temporal resolution down to several femtoseconds
should be achievable. To delay the electron beam, a small magnetic chicane has to
be applied. The trajectory of the electron beam in the chicane has the shape of an
isosceles triangle with the base equal to L. The angle adjacent to the base, θ, is
considered to be small. The optimal parameters of the chicane can be calculated in
the following way. The electron beam delay line needed for time resolved experiments
has to satisfy two requirements. First, the electron beam extra path length, Lθ2/2,
must be long enough to reach a delay time of about 100 femtoseconds. A ﬁrst
question that arises is: why do we want to use 100 fs delay time? Here we direct

4 We can assume that τ
τc, so that no interference is possible between waves
of diﬀerent probe beams. In this case the contribution to the light intensity is
obtained by a suitable summation of the intensity contributions. Since we assume
that τch
τc, there is relatively little loss of generality by making this additional

assumption.

the attention of the reader to the fact that we assume to use 5-10 fs visible pump
pulses. On the other hand we assume that the pump pulse can be approximated
by a delta function. One can never hope to achieve a visible laser pulse duration
ten times shorter than the present. This limitation prevents the application of this
technique to the timescale shorter than 100 fs.

Second, the eﬀect of suppressing the beam density modulation due to the presence
of the energy spread in the electron beam should be avoided in order to preserve
the correlation of the radiation ﬁeld within the delay time. The energy spread sup-
presses signiﬁcantly the microbunching when ω0Lθ2∆γ/(cγ) is larger than or equal
60µm. The delay time
to unity. Parameters in our case are: ∆γ/γ
and energy spread in the electron beam dictates the choice of synchrotron radiation
wavelengths. These results demonstrate that this scheme is adequate for the VUV
spectral range, but cannot be used to produce X-ray probe beams. The situation is
quite diﬀerent for the ﬁrst scheme of autocorrelator (see Fig. 19). Since in this case
the probe beams are produced by X-ray splitter and delay line, the energy spread
limitation does not exist at all.

8 Concluding remarks

A general objective in the development of synchrotron radiation sources is to pro-
duce radiation that is brighter than that from existing sources, or to produce ra-
diation that comes in shorter pulses. Current machines produce bunch lengths in
the 100-ps regime. Many experiments exploit this time dependence. Light-triggered
time-resolved studies with 100 ps resolution are now frequently performed at syn-
chrotron light sources. However, 100 picoseconds is longer than the time associ-
ated with many interesting physical phenomena. The storage ring technology itself
approaches its limits of performance with respect to minimal pulse duration. No
practical means have been found to allow bunches of less than a ten picoseconds
duration to be stored. A proposed in this paper schemes for fast time-resolved ex-
periments could oﬀer the possibility to overcome this limitation. It was shown that
the femtosecond timescale associated with intensity ﬂuctuations in synchrotron light
pulses make them well suited for time-resolved studies. The new concept eliminates
the need for ultrashort X-ray pulses. This development in synchrotron based pump-
probe experiments allows us to investigate phenomena in the time range down to
100 fs. It is the author’s hope that the general principles of pump-probe techniques
based on statistical properties of synchrotron light, presented in this paper, may help
in stimulating further inquiry and result in success in many exciting applications,
some of which can now only be barely envisioned.

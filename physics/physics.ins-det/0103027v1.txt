Abstract

We present an original design for large area gaseous detectors based on the MICROMEGAS technology. This tech-
nology incorporates an insulating grid, sandwiched between the micro-mesh and the anode-pad plane, which provides
an uniform 200 µm ampliﬁcation gap. The uniformity of the ampliﬁcation gap thickness has been veriﬁed. The gain
performances of the detector are presented and compared to the values obtained with detectors using cylindrical micro
spacers. The new design presents several technical and ﬁnancial advantages.

Particle detectors based on the MICROMEGAS technology [1–8] consist of a parallel-plate gas-chamber split into
two asymmetric stages by an intermediate electrode made out of a micro-mesh. By applying appropriate voltages
between the three electrodes, a very high electric ﬁeld (∼ 30 kV/cm) in the thinnest stage (the “ampliﬁcation gap”) and
a low electric ﬁeld (3 kV/cm) in the thicker stage (the “drift” or “conversion gap”) can be simultaneously established.
When a charged particle traverses the conversion gap, it generates primary electrons which are subsequently multiplied
in the ampliﬁcation gap. The ampliﬁed electron cloud is collected on the anode generating a fast electric signal. The
associated ion cloud is quickly collected on the micro-mesh, whereas only a small fraction of the ion cloud enters into
the conversion region. Based on this technology, we had earlier developed [8] large area particle detectors. In the
current detector, the main modiﬁcations with respect our previous developments [8] are:

• The total area of the anode plane has been enlarged to 400×400 mm2, providing an active area of 387× 387
mm2. The anode electrode consists of a 1.0 mm thick printed circuit board. Its inner surface is segmented in
rectangular 12×12 mm2 gilded copper pads. The inter-pad width is 100 µm and the total number of pads is
1024.

• The electro-formed micro-mesh1 consists of a 7 µm thick grid of 508×508 mm2 made of pure Ni. The 106 µm
squared holes grid are outlined by a 20 µm thick border of Ni in steps of 126 µm, i.e. 200 LPI (lines per inch).
The optical transparency reaches 70%. The micro-mesh is stretched on the Plexiglas frame whose height deﬁnes
the 6 mm thick (compared to the 3 mm thick in the earlier design) conversion gap between the micro-mesh and
the cathode plane. The ampliﬁcation gap between the micro-mesh and the anode plane has been doubled to
200 µm.

In this letter, two diﬀerent designs to keep an uniform ampliﬁcation gap of 200 µm have been compared:

• Old design. The ampliﬁcation gap is deﬁned by cylindrical micro-spacers of 200 µm high and 250 µm in

diameter, glued on to the anode-pads with a pitch of 2 mm in both directions.

• New design. The micro-spacers are replaced by an insulating grid sandwiched between the micro-mesh and

the anode plane (see Fig.1).

The new design presents several decisive technical but also ﬁnancial advantages when compared to the cylindrical
micro-spacer design.
Indeed, since the grid is independent of the printed-circuit board, boards and grids can be
interchanged in case of malfunction of one of the two elements. Moreover, the printed-circuit board without cylindrical
micro-spacers is more robust. This particular feature facilitates the production process, in particular the polishing of

the anode-pad surface. In addition, the connectors can be soldered more easily to the back of the board by standard
industrial techniques, thus reducing the cost of the detectors. The choice of the grid material is dictated by the
insulation properties of the material and by its mechanical properties: It must be resistant to heat and rigid enough
to be manipulated. A 200 µm thick FR4 grid of the same size as the printed board (394×394 mm2) was chosen. The
grid consists of 1024 squared cells of 11.8 mm width and 300 µm pitch (see Fig.2). On the edge of the grid, 28 2.4
mm diameter holes provides wide opening for the gas to ﬂow inside the detector.

The critical parameter in the new design is the uniformity of the ampliﬁcation-gap across the grid cells. We have
therefore measured the ampliﬁcation-gap thickness at diﬀerent positions across the grid cell and for various voltages
applied to the micro-mesh. For that purpose, we used a magnifying camera whose position in the three spatial
directions can be accurately measured. With this technique the thickness can be determined with a 5 µm accuracy.
For non-zero voltages the mesh ﬂattens against the grid near its edge of the grid. For usual operating voltages from
-440 V to -600 V (establishing electric ﬁelds from 22 kV/cm to 30 kV/cm), the average ampliﬁcation gap thickness is
(203 ± 5)µm and the diﬀerence in the gap thickness between the edge and the center of a grid hole is less than 10 µm
at -440 V and less than 7 µm at -600V (see Fig.3). Such diﬀerences do not strongly aﬀect the gain uniformity along
the grid cell. In the worse case a gain variation of no more than 40% might occur. This would induce a minor impact
on the detection of minimum ionizing particles. At voltages above -700 V (electric ﬁeld larger than 35 kV/cm) the
mesh is deformed by the electric force and the ampliﬁcation gap thickness reaches a minimum value of (190±5) µm
at the center of the cell.

The gain of this newly designed detector has been measured for diﬀerent gas mixtures and micro-mesh voltages.
A relative determination of the gain has been obtained by measuring the electric current induced in the micro-mesh
when the detector is irradiated by a 90Sr radioactive source. The source was placed on a 50 µm mylar foil replacing
the anode of the detector. We have compared the two designs, cylindrical micro-spacers2 and insulating grid. To
eliminate most of systematic diﬀerences, the measurements have been performed simultaneously, the two detectors
being supplied with gas from the same source. To estimate the absolute gain in the ampliﬁcation gap, we have assumed
that the number of electrons collected by the cathode is equal to the number of ions collected by the micro-mesh. The
resulting electric current gives a relative measure of the detector gain and the following expression gives an estimation
of the gain in the ampliﬁcation gap:

G =

I
e < N > A

(1)

where I is the measured electrical current, e the electron charge, A the activity of the source expressed in Bq (5.6×105
Bq in the present measurement) and < N > the average number of primary electrons created in the 6 mm conversion
gap. This later number obviously depends on the gas mixture, being < N >= 27 for Ne+CO2(5%), < N >= 29 for
Ne+CO2(10%) and < N >= 56 for Ar+CO2(10%). The sensibility of the apparatus to the micro-mesh current was
1nA. The results (see Fig.4) indicate that the two designs behave similarly, although for a given voltage systematically
higher gains are reached. with the micro-spacer design: about 10 V more are needed for the grid design to reach
the same gain as with the micro-spacers. This could be related with a systematic diﬀerence of the ampliﬁcation
gap thickness between both detector designs. As a matter of fact, a variation on the micro-mesh voltage of 10 V
represents a gain variation of around 40%. This gain diﬀerence between both designs would correspond to a gap-
thickness systematic diﬀerence of only 10 µm. In addition, the electron source was placed on a mylar foil 50 µm thick
for the new design and on a Ni micro-mesh 8 µm thick for the old design.

In summary, we have presented a new design for a gas chamber based on Micromegas technology, where the 200 µm
uniform ampliﬁcation gap is provided by an insulating grid sandwiched by the micro-mesh and the cathode-pad board.
The micro-mesh is not strongly deformed for usual operating electric ﬁelds. The measured gain in the ampliﬁcation
gap for diﬀerent gas mixtures and micro-mesh voltages shows results similar to those obtained with cylindrical micro-
spacers. The grid design presents several decisive technical as well as ﬁnancial advantages when compared to the
cylindrical micro-spacers design, thus allowing for the industrial production of inexpensive particle detectors.

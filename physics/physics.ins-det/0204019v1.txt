We have built a high-accuracy wavelength meter for tunable lasers using a scanning Michelson
interferometer and a reference laser of known wavelength. The reference laser is a frequency sta-
bilized diode laser locked to an atomic transition in Rb. The wavemeter has a statistical error per
measurement of 5 parts in 107 which can be reduced considerably by averaging. Using a second
stabilized diode laser, we have veriﬁed that systematic errors are below 4 parts in 108.

The use of diode lasers has become very common in
the ﬁelds of optics and atomic physics [1]. The principal
advantages of these lasers lie in their low cost, narrow
spectral width, tunability over several nm, eﬃcient power
consumption, reliability, and ease of operation. Single
transverse mode laser diodes are available over most of
the near-infrared spectrum from 600–2000 nm. Further-
more, by placing the diode in an external cavity and using
optical feedback from an angle-tuned grating, they can
be made to operate at single frequency (single longitu-
dinal mode) with linewidths of order 1 MHz [2,3]. Such
frequency-stabilized diode lasers have increased the ac-
cess of researchers to experiments which have previously
required expensive ring-cavity dye or Ti-sapphire lasers.
In particular, the ﬁeld of laser cooling has blossomed in
the past decade as several alkali atoms and alkali-like
ions have cooling transitions in the infrared which are
accessible with diode lasers [4]. However, to use lasers
in these applications eﬀectively it is important to know
their absolute wavelength accurately. In many cases, this
is achieved by locking the laser to a known atomic or
molecular transition in a vapor cell. But this may not
always be possible, especially when working with short-
lived radioactive species or trapped ions. One solution is
to measure the wavelength of the laser precisely by beat-
ing its frequency against that of a reference laser in a
scanning optical interferometer.

In this Letter, we present a design for such a waveme-
ter in which the reference laser is a frequency-stabilized
diode laser locked to an atomic transition. This gives the
reference laser the desired frequency stability of 1 MHz
and the required wavelength calibration for absolute mea-
surements. While expensive commercial wavemeters that
use a stabilized He-Ne laser as the reference are available,
our wavemeter is built in-house around a low-cost laser
diode and the entire instrument has a component cost
of less than $1500. To characterize the accuracy of the
instrument, we have measured the wavelength of a sec-
ond stabilized diode laser system. The results indicate
an accuracy of 5 × 10−7 with a 25 cm scan distance, and
that systematic errors are below 4 × 10−8.

The wavemeter, shown schematically in Fig. 1, is based
on a design ﬁrst reported by Hall and Lee [5]. The ba-
sic idea is to obtain the wavelength of an unknown laser
in terms of the wavelength of the reference laser using a

scanning Michelson interferometer where both lasers tra-
verse essentially the same path. As the interferometer is
scanned, the interference pattern on the detectors goes
alternately through bright and dark fringes. Since both
lasers traverse the same path, the ratio of the number of
fringes counted after scanning through a certain distance
is the ratio of the two wavelengths. The ratio obtained
is a wavelength ratio in air, however, the wavelength ra-
tio in vacuum (or equivalent frequency ratio) is easily
calculated by making a small correction for the disper-
sion of air [6] between the two wavelengths. Thus, if the
absolute wavelength of the reference laser is known, the
wavelength of the unknown laser can be determined.

The interferometer consists of a beamsplitter, two
end mirrors, and two retro-reﬂectors mounted back-to-
back on a movable cart. The retro-reﬂectors, made of
three mutually orthogonal mirrors, ensure that the re-
turn beams are displaced from the input beams and do
not feed back into the laser. The movable cart is a brass
block riding on a pressurized air-bearing which allows
it to slide freely over a distance of about 100 cm. The
push-pull design of the interferometer, with the two retro-
reﬂectors mounted back-to-back, has the advantage that
the interference pattern goes through a complete fringe
cycle for every λ/4 displacement of the cart, a factor of
two improvement over designs where only one arm of the
interferometer is scanned. The interferometer produces
two output beams; of these the one on the opposite side
of the beamsplitter from the input beam has near-perfect
contrast (> 90% in our case) because it is a combina-
tion of beams each of which is once reﬂected and once
transmitted through the beamsplitter [7]. This beam is
detected for both the reference laser and the unknown
laser by Si PIN photodiodes and the two signals fed into
a frequency counter. The counter has a ratio function
and directly displays the ratio of the two inputs with
user-settable integration times of up to 10 s.

The diode laser system used as the reference laser is
built around a commercial single-mode laser diode (Mit-
subishi ML60125R-01) with a nominal operating wave-
length of 785 nm and cw output power of 30 mW. The
light is collimated using a 4.5 mm, 0.55 NA aspheric
lens. The laser is frequency stabilized in a standard ex-
ternal cavity design (Littrow conﬁguration) [2] using op-
tical feedback from an 1800 lines/mm diﬀraction grating

mounted on a piezoelectric transducer (see inset of Fig.
1). Using a combination of temperature and current con-
trol, the diode is tuned close to the 780 nm D2 line in
↔ 5P3/2 transition). A part of the out-
atomic Rb (5S1/2
put beam is tapped for Doppler-free saturated-absorption
spectroscopy in a Rb vapor cell [2]. The various hyperﬁne
transitions in the two common isotopes of Rb (85Rb and
87Rb) are clearly resolved, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1.
The linewidth of the hyperﬁne peaks is 15–20 MHz; this
is somewhat larger than the 6.1 MHz natural linewidth
and is primarily limited by power broadening due to the
pump beam [8]. The injection current into the laser diode
is modulated slightly to obtain an error signal and the
laser is locked to the F ′ = (3, 4) crossover resonance in
85Rb, i.e. 60 MHz below the F = 3 ↔ F ′ = 4 transi-
tion. From the Rb energy level tables [9] and measured
hyperﬁne shifts [10], this corresponds to a frequency of
3.8422958×1014 Hz. The elliptic laser beam (5.8 mm×1.8
mm 1/e2 dia) is directly fed into the interferometer. The
large Rayleigh ranges (∼34 m and ∼3 m, respectively)
ensure that the beam remains collimated over the length
of the interferometer.

To characterize the wavemeter, we have measured the
wavelength of a second identical diode laser system but
which was locked to a diﬀerent hyperﬁne transition in
85Rb. The measurement serves two purposes: ﬁrst, the
scatter in the data gives an estimate of the statisti-
cal error associated with our instrument since both the
reference laser and the unknown laser are stabilized to
linewidths below 1 MHz (about 3 parts in 109), and sec-
ond, the data tells us if there are any systematic errors
associated with our instrument because the diﬀerence be-
tween the two laser frequencies is already known very
precisely [10]. The measurements were done with the
second laser locked to a hyperﬁne transition in 85Rb that
was 2944 MHz higher than the frequency of the refer-
ence laser. This implies that the measured ratio should
be 1.00000766. The actual values obtained are shown in
Fig. 2 as a histogram plot. The data have a fairly good
Gaussian distribution and the ﬁt yields a mean value of
1.00000763(4) and a spread of 5.3 × 10−7.

Statistical errors in the measured data arise mainly be-
cause the frequency counter only detects zero-crossings
and does not count fractional fringes. The total num-
ber of fringes counted depends on the fringe rate (or cart
speed) coupled with the 10 s integration time. Currently
our photodiode electronics limits the cart speed so that
we can use only about 25 cm of cart travel per measure-
ment. This results in the single shot statistical error of
5 parts in 107 in the data [11]. However, the mean value
has an error of only 4×10−8 since it is an average of more
than 100 individual measurements. With some improve-
ments in the counting electronics, it should be possible
to use 50–100 cm of cart travel for each measurement
and thereby reduce the statistical error per measurement
below 1 × 10−7. Resolution enhancement is also possi-
ble by phase-locking to the fringe signal, as described in
Ref. [5]. This allows fractional fringes to be counted ac-

curately and the statistical error to be reduced for the
same cart travel. Finally, data contamination can occur
if partial fringes are counted when the cart turns around
at the end of its travel. We therefore take data only when
the cart is travelling in one direction.

It is important to eliminate all sources of systematic er-
ror when aiming for such high accuracy. The chief cause
of systematic error is non-parallelism of the two beams in
the interferomter. Any misalignment would cause an in-
crease in the measured ratio given by 1/ cos θ, where θ is
the angle between the beams. We have tried to minimize
this error by using the unused output beam of the refer-
ence laser (the one on the same side of the beamsplitter
as the input beam) as a tracer for aligning the unknown
laser beam, and checking for parallelism over a distance
of about 2 m [12]. The consistency of the mean value
of 1.00000763(3) with the expected value (1.00000766)
shows that this method works quite well for accuracies
up to 4 × 10−8. We have also found it useful to check for
parallelism by looking for a minimum in the measured
ratio as the angle of the unknown beam is varied. This
works because the measured value is always larger than
the correct value, whether θ is positive or negative, and
becomes minimum when θ = 0.

In conclusion, we have built a high-accuracy waveme-
ter using a scanning Michelson interferometer and a ref-
erence diode laser. The frequency-stabilized diode laser
is locked to an atomic transition in Rb for absolute cal-
ibration. Using a second stabilized diode laser, we have
shown that the statistical error in each measurement is 5
parts in 107, and the systematic error is less than 4 parts
in 108. We have recently used this wavemeter to measure
the wavelength of a diode laser tuned to the 795 nm D1
↔ 5P1/2 transition) [13], which yields
line in Rb (5S1/2
a precise value for the ﬁne-structure interval in the 5P
state of Rb. The precision obtained is an order of magni-
tude better than published values [9] and demonstrates
the power of the instrument for precision spectroscopy ex-
periments. Hyperﬁne splittings, which are of order GHz,
are more accessible to techniques such as microwave res-
onance or heterodyne measurements [14]. On the other
hand, ﬁne-structure splittings are of order THz and our
technique is uniquely suited for precise measurements in
this range of frequency diﬀerences.

[7] We obtain better than 90% fringe contrast even though
our beamsplitter is close to 60/40. The other output
beam has perfect contrast only if the beamsplitter is ex-
actly 50/50. However, as discussed later, this beam is
useful in reducing systematic errors by ensuring that the
unknown beam is parallel to the reference.

cell is estimated to be ∼10 kHz and the linewidth of the
laser has been independently measured to be ∼1 MHz.

[11] The calculated error from missing one fringe over a dis-
−7 at 780 nm. The measured
tance of 25 cm is about 8×10
error is smaller because we are measuring a wavelength
ratio very close to 1, and chances are high that either
both counters see a zero-crossing or miss it. In fact, if
we try to measure a ratio of exactly 1 by locking both
lasers to the same transition, we get a bimodal distribu-
tion in the measured ratios: 1.0000000 most of the time
and occasionally 1.0000008 which corresponds to one ex-
tra fringe counted by the second detector. That is why we
have chosen to measure a test ratio of 1.00000766 where
the distribution is Gaussian.

[12] Ideally, the unknown beam should enter exactly where
the reference beam exits so that both beams traverse ex-
actly the same path in opposite directions. However, this
causes one laser to feed into the other and destabilize
it. Therefore we align the beams with a small oﬀset and
check for parallelism over a ﬁnite distance.

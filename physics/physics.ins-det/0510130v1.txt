Abstract

We report on a technique developed to diagnostic for non working readout
channels of the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), one of the three inner
detectors of the ATLAS experiment. From a detailled study, we show that
99.6 % of the readout channels of the TRT endcap-detector are perfectly
operational.

1 Introduction

The ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) [1], part of the ATLAS inner detector,
is designed to provide electron identiﬁcation and charged particle track reconstruction at
the nominal design luminosity of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The initial TRT
consists of two parts, a barrel section comprising three cylindrical rings each containing
32 identical modules made of axially aligned straws (2×52544 readout channels) and two
end-cap TRT parts, made each of two sets of identical and independent eight-plane wheels
with radially oriented straws (12 A-type eight-plane wheels, 8 B-type) for a total number of
readout channels equal to 245760 straws.

The main interface of each of these wheels to the outside world consists of 2 × 32 ﬂex-
rigid printed circuit boards called Wheel End-cap Board or WEB as shown in Fig. 1, used
to connect the straws to the high-voltage supply and to collect the signal from the wire to
the front-end electronics.

Figure 1: Photograph of a Wheel End-cap Board (WEB) of the ATLAS TRT End-cap
detector.

The analogue signal collected from the anode through the WEB is transmitted to the

on-detector-front-end electronics boards, which comprise:

- the TRT Analog Shaper Discriminator Base Line Restorer chip (ASDBLR) [2], which
integrates 8 identical channels on a 3.3 × 3.6 mm 2 die. Each channel features a
preampliﬁer connected to the anode wire with an intrinsic noise of 0.3 fC and a dy-
namic range which exceeds 100 fC, a shaper for the ion tail cancellation (τ ≃ 7 ns),
a baseline restorer and two discriminators with adjustable thresholds. A low-level
threshold (typically ≃ 250 eV) is used to provide a precise measurement of the drift
time for charged particles and a high-level threshold (typically ≃ 6-7 keV) is used to
identify the absorbed transition radiation (TR) photons.

2

- the status of the low-level discriminator is then fed into the Drift-Time Measurement
Read-Out Chip (DTMROC) [3], which samples the signal eight times per bunch cross-
ing through a Delay Lock Loop (DLL), thereby providing drift time measurements
with a 25/8 ns time bin size. The result of the high-level threshold is latched and
as a result the DTMROC produces a total of 9 data bits per channel foreach bunch
crossing. A total of three bunch crossings are read out for each straw ( 27 bits total
over 75 ns).

A schematic view of one channel is presented on Fig. 2, with some speciﬁc details of the
WEB connection to the anode wires which are relevant to the results presented in this note
(blind holes and vias).

As an integral part of the quality assurance process implemented during and after as-
sembly of the TRT detector, the diﬀerent wheels of the TRT end-caps have to fulﬁll several
stringent acceptance criteria [4] and are submitted to a serie of well-deﬁned tests, such as
high-voltage tests, wire-tension measurements, gas-gain uniformity measurements, etc...
During these so-called acceptance tests (AT), straws found to be out of speciﬁcations are
disconnected from their high voltage group by un-soldering the 24Ω protection resistor (Fig.
2). Careful studies have shown that most of the problematic channels are due to metalli-
sation cracks in the signal vias or (more rarely) blind holes of the WEBs, as shown by the
photograph in Fig. 3.
After repair of these channels, the total number of disconnected channels after the acceptance
tests is below 0.2% for the ﬁrst set of end-cap wheels (122880 channels).

All relevant repair information, together with a full list of disconnected and anomalous
channels is provided as part of an electronic passport, which is stored in an ORACLE-based
database foreach eight-plane TRT wheel.

Figure 3: Crack due to a bad metallisation of one signal via of a TRT end-cap WEB.

After completion of all the Acceptance tests, the eight-plane wheels are stacked horizon-

tally and are then made available for installation of the front-end electronic boards.
The integration sequence comprises:

1) a qualiﬁcation of the front-end boards based on stringent selection criterias (all channels

operational and their electronic response within speciﬁcations).

2) a noise scan over the 8-bits low-level threshold with a step of one, taking 500 events

events per scan point.

3) a built in test pulse scan over the low-level threshold with a step of one, taking 250

4) a built in test pulse scan over the high-level threshold with a step of one, taking 250

5) a run using the accumulation mode of the DTMROC chip at one set of thresholds (120
DAC ≃ 300 eV for the tracking threshold and 45 DAC ≃ 1.2 keV ), with 50 event at
each of the diﬀerent gating time windows.

Tests 2), 3) and 4) are repeated when the electronics is connected to the detector.
The results of each of these tests are stored in a powerful MySQL-based database and
retrieved for analysis with a PHP-based web interface.

4

To check for connectivity of the diﬀerent readout channels, the latest oﬀ- and on-detector
noise scans are used together with the accumulation mode scan. The ditribution of the noise
rate diﬀerences is ﬁtted to a Gaussian curve of mean µ and RMS σ and channels with values
below µ − 3 × σ are studied in more details.
First, the electronic board is inspected for any faulty component. For instance, the Fujitsu
female connectors are carefully checked to have an impedance about 28 kΩ from one input
(active or dummy) to ground. Rare are the electronic boards which fail this test, since strin-
gent quality requirements are applied to select boards to be mounted on the detector.
Then, using a battery-operated pF-meter, the diﬀerent Fujitsu male connectors on the de-
tector are probed looking at some abnormal capacitance from active pin to ground. This
method, combined with the value obtained with the rate integral technique, permits to locate
the problem on the detector side, at the via close to the active pin of the Fujitsu, or at the
blind hole or directly at the straw as depicted on Fig. 2. Abnormal channels show usually
a capacitance value lower by more than 5 pF than the average of the corresponding WEB.
Finally a last technique uses the special ”diode check” function of a volt-meter. A small
DC current is injected between the diode ground and the signal output and then the for-
ward voltage drop of the diode is measured. An abnormal value, with respect to the Fujitsu
average, is directly linked to a problem of one of the two vias as shown on Fig. 2.

During the implementation of this procedure, robust and redundant techniques have been
developed to identify problematic channels, which may have appeared since the acceptance
testing of the wheels or the qualiﬁcation of the front-end electronic boards.

2 The Noise Rate Integral Technique

The ﬁrst method used to characterise and quantify the board performance is the noise rate
shown in Fig. 4 as a function of the low-level threshold applied to the ASDBLR chip. This
rate is deﬁned as the number of transitions from low to high discriminator level output for
a given DAC setting of the low-level threshold. For small discriminator values of the DAC
setting, the output level is almost always high for all eight time bins and the number of
transitions therefore drops to zero for low values of the low-level threshold.
For higher values of the DAC setting, the number of transitions from low to high increases
and reaches a maximum in the region between 40-50 DAC counts (near the zero threshold
of the comparator of the ASDBLR chip). The typical value of the maximum corresponds
to the maximum bandwidth of the ASDBLR (≃ 35 MHz). For even larger DAC settings,
the number of transitions decreases and reaches the design speciﬁcations (a rate of about
300 kHz) for low-threshold values of about ≃ 100-120 DAC counts, which corresponds to a
low-threshold close to 200 eV.

As show in Fig. 4, once the front-end electronics board is connected to the TRT wheel,
the input load increases to that of the WEB plus the straw itself and therefore the total
Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC) is larger. This results then in a broader noise rate curve,
which can be used to identify disconnected channels.

Threshold [DAC]

Figure 4: Noise rate as a function of the low-level threshold DAC setting for a TRT end-
cap board, when measured oﬀ-detector (full circles) and on-detector (open squares). For an
operational setting of close to 200 eV (≃ 100-120 DAC counts), the noise counting rate per
straw is about 300 kHz.

Several quantities, based on the noise rate curve shown in Fig. 4, have been investigated:

- the ≃2 % occupancy level (summed over three bunch crossing) corresponding to a rate

of 300 kHz;

5.

- within the approximation of a Gaussian distribution for the noise rate curve, the σ

obtained from a Gaussian ﬁt to the distributions of Fig. 4;

- the integral of the noise rate curves can be computed and compared as shown in Fig.

The integral noise rate turns out to be the most sensitive and reliable measurement to
identify problematic channels of the type described in the introduction, i.e. channels with
metallisation problems causing poor connectivity between the ASDBLR chip and the anode
wire.

Fig. 5 clearly demonstrates the good discrimination potential of the integral noise rate,
since a separation of about 300 counts (DAC×MHz) is observed on average between the oﬀ-

and on-detector measurements.
This is illustrated on Fig. 6 which shows the diﬀerence between the two noise rate integrals
for a well-behaved WEB and for a WEB with one channel displaying metallisation problems
not seen during the acceptance testing. For the well-behaved WEB, the distribution is
centered around 320 DAC×MHz counts with a Gaussian RMS of about 50 DAC×MHz
counts. Problematic channels appear at much lower values and front-end board behavior
have been removed by ﬁtting each distribution to ﬁnd its mean and RMS.

The mean value of the distributions shown in Fig. 6 are also quite sensitive to the two
analogue voltages used to power the ASDBLR chips. A small shift of one of these voltages
from its nominal setting at ±3 Volts will result in a shift of the noise rate integral diﬀer-
ence distribution. A careful study of the possible systematic eﬀects due to these analogue
voltages was performed by changing the voltage settings by ±0.1 Volts for the noise scan
measurements both on- and oﬀ-detector. These result in large shifts of the noise rate integral
diﬀerence distributions from 250 to 390 DAC × MHz. To minimise such eﬀects, at each mea-
surement on- and oﬀ-detector, the applied analogue voltages were tuned to be within±0.02
Volts of the nominal ±3 Volts.
The selection criteria deﬁning channels as problematic from these measurements were cho-
sen as follows: the distribution of the noise rate integral diﬀerences was ﬁtted to a Gaussian
curve of mean µ and RMS σ and channels with values below µ − 3 × σ were ﬂagged as
problematic.
The noise scan rate integral technique was then combined to another independant method
described in the next section to fully characterise the problematic channels.

3 The Accumulation Mode Technique

The DTMROC chip features a so-called accumulation mode for the high-level threshold hits.
By enabling this mode, the front-end electronics can be operated in such a way that, once
the high-level threshold bit has been set, the bit remains set until the relevant DTMROC
conﬁguration register bit is cleared.

A technique to check for the connectivity features the accumulation mode. The TRT
detector is ﬁlled with Argon-CO2 gas mixture (70:30) and a nominal high voltage of 1350

Figure 7: Total number of events with a high-level threshold bit using the accumulation
mode for a total of 50 L1A software triggers.

Volts is applied between the anode and the cathode of each of the straws. Under these con-
ditions, micro-discharges occur near the straws or on the WEBs, the signal is then collected,
ampliﬁed and shaped by the ASDBLR which ternary output is then fed into the DTMROC
for digitization. As it is shown on Fig. 2, a problem in the electronic chain, like a bad
metalization, or a problem with one of the electronic components will directly appear, since
for this particular channel, the high-level threshold accumulation state will not be reached.
The accumulation mode technique implements the following algorithm:

1) work at two well deﬁned values for the low- and high-level thresholds: 120 DAC ≃ 300

eV for the tracking threshold and 45 DAC ≃ 1.2 keV for the TR threshold.

2) set the DTMROC chip in the accumulation mode.

3) gate for a given time τi ( from some µs to a few ms).

4) issue a software trigger, read the event and decode the corresponding three bunch
crossing high-level threshold bit information. Check whether some of the 3 high-level
bits are set.

5) repeat steps 2) to 4) for a given number of events (N ≃ 50 events). Call the total

number of events with response over threshold ni.

f) increase the gating time τi, by typically a factor 2, and repeat steps 2) to 5).

Fig. 7 shows typical values for ni for diﬀerent gating times τi. As expected, ni, the number of
events for which the accumulation mode is reached, increases as the gating time τi is longer.

9

The accumulation rate, or dark current rate, is then deﬁned as:

rk′ =

Σini
Σiτi × 1 − exp (−rk × τi)

rk × τi

(1)

A distribution of the rate is shown on Fig. 8. Typically, working channels have a rate
value greater than 0.1 Hz, whereas problematic ones have values below 0.01 Hz. For some
TRT endcap-wheels, the accumulation rate distribution shows clearly a larger activity on
one of the lowest of the two 4-Planes wheels, whereas for other ones a rate of about 1 Hz is
measured across all the readout channels.
The Accumulation mode technique, combined with the noise scan method oﬀers then a
powerful method to check for additional problematic channels in the TRT detector.

4 Analysis and Results Interpretation

The connectivity check method based on the noise scan rate integral and the accumulation
mode techniques has been successfully applied during the integration of the TRT endcap-
detector.
Finally, only 487 readout channels are found not to be responding. These channels comprise
231 channels for which the protection resistors were unsoldered after they failed the serie of
acceptance tests. Typically, these channels are characterised by a noise scan rate integral
diﬀerence value about 130 DAC×MHz counts, much lower than the WEB average ( below
three σ of the mean value µ). The total distribution of the rate integral is presented on Fig.
10. In addition, their corresponding accumulation mode rate is about 10 times lower than

the WEB average, below 0.01 Hz and reaches for most of these channels a typical value of 0
Hz (see Fig. 13).
These 231 disconnected channels represent for both A-and B-type TRT endcap-detectors
about 45 % of the total number of problematic channels found at the end of the integration.
At the same time, they represent a very small fraction of the total number of readout chan-
nels of the TRT endcap-detector. Only 0.19 % of the total number of channels have been
disconnected after acceptance tests.
The tests used to check for connectivity, during the integration of the TRT endcap-detector
report a total of 256 new problematic channels, 127 for A-type and 129 for B-type wheels.
A non negligeable fraction of these channels, are ones for which several repairs have been
done during the acceptance tests. As it is shown on Tab. 1, 48 of these 256 channels have
been repaired during acceptance tests and even stronger correlation exists between these
channels and bad WEBs, i.e. WEBs for which some repairs were done.
Another interesting remark concerns the fraction of repaired channels: A-type WEBs need
more repairs than B-type ones (see Tab. 3). For several wheels, like A02C for instance, all
the repaired channels break again with time and thus fail the integration tests.
The other 208 new bad channels, perfectly operational after the completion of the accep-
tance tests, are largely due to WEB via issues. Several explanations have been suggested to
understand the apparition of these new faulty channels. For a small fraction, they appeared
during their transportation from the acceptance test stand to the integration test area. For
others, they simply have been not seen by the serie of acceptance tests, but are more sensi-
tive to the two methods implemented during the integration. For a last fraction, a possible
explanation is metallisation issues evolving with time.
The eﬃciency of the two methods described in the previous section is clearly established.
it enables to ﬁnd 256 new problematic channels, most of them being reported non working
by both methods. For instance, only 40 channels are not found by the noise scan based
technique (see Fig. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15).
At the end of the integration, the fraction of non-working readout channels represent only
0.4 % of the 122880 of the Stack C.

5 Conclusions

A powerful technique to identify possible problems for the diﬀerent readout channels of the
ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker has been described. Applied to the case of one TRT
endcap-detector, it shows that 99.6 % of the readout channels are perfectly operational. The
remaining 0.4 % are essentially due to metallisation issues of the active WEBs. Moreover,
several goals concerning electronics performance and not discussed in this report, have been
achieved, like for instance the ≃ 2% occupancy corresponding to a low-level threshold at
about 110-120 DAC counts (see Fig. 16 to Fig. 25).

An ageing test of three ATLAS production RPC stations is in course at X5-GIF, the CERN irradiation facility.
The chamber eﬃciencies are monitored using cosmic rays triggered by a scintillator hodoscope. Higher statistics
measurements are made when the X5 muon beam is available. We report here the measurements of the eﬃciency
versus operating voltage at diﬀerent source intensities, up to a maximum counting rate of about 700Hz/cm2. We
describe the performance of the chambers during the test up to an overall ageing of 4 ATLAS equivalent years

correspondong to an integrtaed charge of 0.12C/cm

, including a safety factor of 5.

1. Experimental setup

The Gamma Irradiation Facility, GIF, located
downstream of the ﬁnal dump of the X5 beam,
uses a 137Cs source of 20 Ci to produce a large
ﬂux of 660 keV γ rays. A system of lead ﬁlters
allow to reduce the ﬂux up to a factor of 104. The
X5 muon beam can also be sent into the area. A
more detailed description of this facility and of
the characteristics of the γ ﬂux can be found in
[1].

Three production ATLAS RPC chambers
(BML-D) are installed in the area, along the
beam line. The chambers have 2 detector layers
which are read out by strips oriented in both the
η and ϕ directions The chambers are perpendic-
ular to the beam line, with the long side (about

4m) oriented in the vertical direction. For details
on the chamber structure, see [6]. The cham-
bers are operated with the ATLAS gas mixture
C2H2F4/i–C4H10/SF6 = 94.7/5/0.3.

The trigger is provided by the coincidence of
three scintillator layers of 33x40 cm2, each made
of three slabs. During the beam runs, the three
layers are aligned along the beam line, while
for the cosmic rays runs, they are arranged as
a telescope with the axis oriented at 40 degrees
with respect to the vertical direction, in order to
maximize the trigger rate.
Signals from the frontend electronics are sent
to a standard ATLAS “splitter board” [5] as in
the ﬁnal architecture foreseen for the trigger and
readout electronics , and subsequently to TDCs
working in common stop mode (see [2]) which
record up to 16 hits per event per channel, in a
2µs gate. Both the leading and falling edges of

1

the signals are recorded. The data acquisition is
performed using a LabViewTMapplication.

The DCS system, also implemented using
LabViewTM, records both the low and and high
voltages as well as the gap currents. Gas compo-
sition, together with all relevant environmental
data such as pressure, temperature and relative
humidity are controlled as well. The gas relative
humidity, also monitored by the DCS, is set in the
range of 30%-50% by bubbling in water a fraction
of the total gas ﬂux.

2. Ageing status

The integrated ageing from the beginning of
irradiation (November 2002) up to July 2003, is
equivalent to 4.1 ATLAS years. The ageing is
evaluated assuming a total charge per count of
30pC and a counting rate 5 to 10 times larger
than expected from the background simulations
in the ATLAS cavern. Two main ageing parame-
ters were measured during the test: the electrode
plate resistivity, which was shown in a previous
test ([4]) to gradually increase with the inte-
grated detector current, and the noise current,
which is an indicator of possible degradations of
the electrode surface.

3. Experimental results

All along the test, the chamber eﬃciencies are
monitored using cosmic rays. The value of the de-
tector plate resistivity are also periodically mea-
sured, as discussed below. Gap currents are mea-
sured on a daily basis, both with fully open source
and closed source. A typical plot of the current
versus operating voltage is shown in ﬁgure 1.
After 3.5 Atlas years (about 100 mC/cm2 inte-
grated charge) accurate eﬃciency measurements
have been performed using the X5 muon beam.

The plate resistivity is a crucial parameter for
RPC performance because it determines the de-
tector rate capability. Two diﬀerent methods
were followed for the resitivity measurements:

HV drop correction. This method is based on
the comparison of the eﬃciency plateaus with and

without source irradiation. As shown in ﬁgure
2, the current driven under irradiation is much
higher than the one just due to the muon beam
or cosmic rays. This curent produces a signiﬁcant
voltage drop across the plates and the voltage ap-
plied to the gas can be written (see [3]) as

Vgas = V − RplIgap

(1)

where Vgas is the eﬀective voltage on the gas
gap, V is the power supply voltage and I is the
current driven by the gap.

This drop causes the eﬃciency plateaus under
irradiation to be shifted at higher HV values, as
shown in ﬁgure 2. This shift, allows to evaluate
the plate resistivity when the gap current is also
measured.

ATLAS gas mixture is replaced by pure Ar. As
shown in ﬁgure 3, the I-V curve is characterized
in this case by a transition region around V=2kV
with a fast current increase. For higher voltages
a linear current increase is observed. We assume
that above the transition voltage, the drop across
the Argon remains constant, so that the slope
∆V /∆I in the linear region gives the plates total

resistance.

During the test, the chamber eﬃciencies are
monitored using cosmic rays triggered by the
scintillators. High statistics eﬃciency measure-
ments are made when the X5 muon beam is
available.

For each event, the muon trajectory is recon-

structed.

The scintillator slabs of the trigger system, of
size 11x40cm2, would only allow a very modest
tracking, not suﬃcient to eliminate all accidental
hits at very high counting rate induced by the
source. The tracking capability is therefore im-
proved using the hits recorded by the RPCs, as
decribed below:
(1) Hits recorded by the RPC under test are
ignored in the tracking.
(2) Only hits registered in a time window of 25ns
around the beam peack are considered useful for
the track reconstruction.
(3) A track is considered reliable only if it is built

with only one cluster.
(4) A reliable tracking in both the η and ϕ direc-
tions is required.
(5) The layer is considered eﬃcient if it shows a
cluster aligned to the track within ± 1 strip.

High statistics measurements were made with
the X5 beam. Data sets were taken with diﬀerent
front end electronic thresholds, source intensities,
and operating voltages. The plateaus shown in
ﬁgure 2, for example, refer to the gap number
1, which is the nearest to the source (at about
2.5m).
Figure 4 shows, for the same gap, the counting
rate as a function of the HV for diﬀerent irradia-
tion intensities.

4. Gas recirculation

At the beginning of July 2003 the gas closed
loop was introduced on 4 out of the 6 tested gas
gaps, in order to simulate the real working condi-
tions in ATLAS. The two remaining gaps were
left in open ﬂow for comparison. The output
gas of the chambers goes through a system of ﬁl-
ters and then is sent again in the gaps, together
with a fraction of fresh gas. The total gas ﬂow
is set at 40 l/h, and the fraction of recirculated

The measurements performed at X5-GIF on
three ATLAS production RPCs have shown an
increase of the electrode plate resistivity, as ex-
pected from previous tests ([4]). The rate capa-
bility of all tested chambers remains, however,
much above the ATLAS requirements.
Indeed,
all the gaps under test showed a very good detec-
tion eﬃciency even at fully opened source, with a
counting rate of about 700Hz/cm2.
An increase of the source-oﬀ currents was ob-
served during the summer. This eﬀect, due to the
extreme conditions of the test (about 40 times the
nominal ATLAS rate), has been shown to be am-
pliﬁed by low gas ﬂow and operating temperature
above 30◦C. This eﬀect was shown to be to some
extent reversible, when the gas ﬂow and tempera-
ture conditions are set again to acceptable values
and the ageing rate is reduced. Ohmic currents
didn’t show any signiﬁcant increase all along the
ageing test, except the variations due to temper-
ature excursion.

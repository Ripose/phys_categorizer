Abstract

The barrel part of the ATLAS pixel detector will consist of 112 carbon-carbon structures called ”staves” with
13 hybrid detector modules being glued on each stave. The demands on the glue joints are high, both in terms
of mechanical precision and thermal contact. To achieve this precision a custom-made semi-automated mounting
machine has been constructed in Wuppertal, which provides a precision in the order of tens of microns. As this is
the last stage of the detector assembly providing an opportunity for stringent tests, a detailed procedure has been
deﬁned for assessing both mechanical and electrical properties. This note gives an overview of the procedure for
aﬃxation and tests, and summarizes the ﬁrst results of the production.

1. Introduction

ATLAS will be a particle physics experiment at
the future Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which
is being built at CERN and is expected to start
operation in 2007.

The pixel detector is the innermost component
of the ATLAS inner tracker. In the barrel the de-
tector modules are mounted on staves, while the
modules in the end caps are organized in disk sec-
tors.

The pixel detector consists of 1774 detector mod-

ules (barrel: 1456 modules; discs: 318).

The stave cooling circuit is made of a thin alu-

inner cross section of the stave carbon structure.

The material chosen is 6060 aluminum alloy.
This material shows good extrusion properties at
small thickness.

The most important components of a detector

module are:
– 46080 individual pixel sensors with size of

50µm × 400µm

– 16 front end read out chips
– 1 module controller chip

2. Local Supports (”Staves”)

The pixel stave is the module local support unit
of the barrel section of the pixel detector. The com-
ponents of a stave are the thermal management
tile (TMT), the stave carbon structure, and the
stave cooling circuit. Additionally, every stave has
two geometrical reference marks (ruby balls). The
stave coordinate system is speciﬁed in Figure 4.

The TMT itself consists of two parts. Both parts
have a shingled design with an angle of 1.1 degrees
which are glued together.

As material

for the TMTs, Carbon-Carbon
(C-C) has been chosen. The reason for this is a
thermal conductivity which is 10-100 times better
than standard Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic
(CFRP), even in the transverse direction to the
ﬁbres. It has excellent mechanical properties, sta-
bility, and transparency to particles.

The TMT is made of 1502 ZV 22 C-C material
from SGL (Augsburg, Germany). The raw mate-
rial is in the form of plates of about 6 mm thick-
ness. The plates consist of 2-D roving fabric carbon
ﬁbres layers overlapped in a phenolic resin matrix,
densiﬁed, and graphitized at high temperature to
enhance the thermal properties. The raw TMTs are
machined to the ﬁnal stepping shape with a CNC

linear guideways from Schneeberger 2 type Mono-
rail BM are mounted to allow movement of the
central measurement unit, the microscope M 420
from Leica 3 . The microscope itself is connected to
OWIS 4 micrometric tables and allows movements
in all dimensions. The movements are controlled
by Heidenhain 5 sealed linear encoders. Heidenhain
Digital Readouts type ND 760 are used for display-
ing and storing the position of the M 420 using a
Personal Computer. The module mounting head is
connected to several linear guides, goniometer and
rotary tables to reach any position. The module is
ﬁxed by vacuum to the mounting head and its po-
sition is always monitored by the microscope.

For the deposition of the glue a computer con-
trolled dispenser from EFD 6 type 1502 is used. The
assembly time of each module is about 1 hour, the
curing time of the glue is 2 hours. This leads to a
production rate of 1 stave per week.

The cooling system is based on the evaporation
of ﬂuorocarbon and provides an operating temper-
ature of about −6◦C.

The stave carbon structure (”omega proﬁle”)
is made of three layers of unidirectional ultra
high modulus (UHM) carbon ﬁbre reinforced
cyanate ester resin pre-preg (preimpregnated).
The adopted lay-up (0-90-0), 0.3 mm thick, has
been optimised through an extensive design and
test program. The choice of the pre-preg material
and of the lay-up with a central cross-layer has
been made in order to match the longitudinal CTE
to that of the impregnated C-C, thus minimizing
distortions resulting during cool-down. The 13
modules are arranged one after the other along
the stave axis and they are partially overlapped in
order to achieve the required coverage in the axial
direction. Thus, the surface of the stave in contact
with the modules is stepped and the modules are
arranged in a shingled layout.

However, C-C materials have two main techno-
logical drawbacks limiting their application range:
porosity and diﬃculty to achieve complex and
accurate geometries due to the high temperature
manufacturing process.

To overcome the porosity of the C-C material,
it was impregnated with resin such that inﬁltra-
tion by the thermal greases and carbon dust release
could be avoided.

3. Loading Machine

For the assembly of modules on staves a custom
made module loading machine was developed and
built in Wuppertal. The requirements of this ma-
chine are:
– handling the modules with minimal stress
– positioning of modules on the stave with an ac-

curancy better than 50 microns

– regular glue deposition

microscope positioning system

To control the applied stress the bow of each

module is measured before and after loading.

The main components of the module loading ma-
chine are the granite base of 1 × 2m and a ﬂatness
of 2µm from Johan Fischer 1 . On this base several

4. Results

The x, y, and z position of the glued modules of
each stave is controlled with respect to the stave
ruby balls. These provide the reference system for
the module position and allow one to assess the
accuracy of the loading procedure.

As a typical result the z position measurement
for 13 staves is provided in Figure 6. For each stave
the deviation from the nominal position is shown
for each of the 13 modules. The stated module ID’s
are equivalent to deﬁned locations on the stave.
The tolerances are ±50µm and are indicated in the
ﬁgure by thicker lines.

The plot shows that the accuracy of the z posi-
tioning is always within the tolerances of ±50µm.
In Figure 7, the distribution of the z-deviation is
given and demonstrates that 50% of the modules
are glued with an accuracy which is even better
than 15µm. One can also see that there is a sys-
tematic shift of 6-7µm.

As mentioned previously, the diﬀerence between
the bow of the module before and after loading is
an indicator as to whether stress has been applied
during the loading procedure. Figure 8 shows the
mean bow diﬀerence (mean value), averaged over

Fig. 7. Distribution of z-deviation

all 13 modules of one stave, as well as the Standard
Deviation (SD) and the average of the absolute
values (mean of amounts).

One can see, that the bow diﬀerence is always
better than 25µm. This is interpreted to show
that a minimum of stress is being applied to the
modules during the loading procedure.

5. Conclusion

A module loading machine for the ATLAS pixel
detector has been successfully realized in Wupper-
tal. All requirements of the mounting precision are
fulﬁlled. The position of the modules after loading
are well within the tolerances. The applied stress
during loading is negligible.

Eﬀects of ion drift on time-over-threshold charge
estimates using ﬁrst-order integrators in thermal
neutron MWPC.

Abstract

Time-over-threshold measurements of the output of a ﬁrst order in-
tegration ampliﬁer can be used as a cheap way to estimate the charge
deposited on a wire in an MWPC. Even if the time scale of the ﬁrst or-
der system is seemingly much larger than the signal development time,
we noticed experimentally a signiﬁcant deviation from the relationship
of time-over-threshold and the charge, as would be naively expected from
the exponential response of the ampliﬁer. We strongly suspect the current
induced by the residual ion movement to be at least partially responsible
for this observation. It is of course well-known that the ion movement is
responsible for the bulk of the signal generation in a wire chamber, this
is not the point ; however, the surprise is rather that this movement has
inﬂuences on time scales which are so long that the ﬁnite ion movement
could be thought negligible. In this paper we will treat theoretically the
inﬂuence of ion movement and of AC coupling on the expected time-over-
threshold relationship and confront this to the measurements on a small
test MWPC in thermal neutron detection.

1 Introduction.

In thermal neutron detection in gas detectors, a relatively short trace of charge
is generated as a result of the nuclear interaction between the thermal neutron
and an active component in the gas such as He-3. If this charge trace is de-
tected in a MWPC, it can be that several anode wires are hit. When treating
the individual wire signals by pure discrimination, some information gets lost
and deteriorates the accuracy of the position measurement. Although accurate
charge measurements on each wire are possible, this is sometimes considered as
an overkill. A ”poor man’s ADC”, such as a measure of time-over-threshold
can maybe convey enough information in order to improve the accuracy of the
measurement, while keeping the simplicity of a discrimination signal. The rela-
tionship of collected charge versus time-over-threshold (t-o-t) is deduced by the

1

authors of ([1] and [2]) purely based on the simulation of the electronic part of
the signal chain, which is probably justiﬁed because they use a fast detector.
However, in this paper we will try to show that the relationship between the
t-o-t and the charge in a MWPC cannot just be extracted from the impulse
response of the ampliﬁer alone. For a ﬁrst-order ampliﬁer transfer function, the
t-o-t is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the ion movement that induces the current
signal in the anode wire. Also AC-coupling has a strong inﬂuence on this t-o-t
measurement.

2 Experimental setup and electrostatics.

A small prismatic MWPC has been build where 16 anode wires of 25 micron
diameter and 16 cathode wires of 75 micron diameter form two parallel planes,
at 2 resp. 6 mm from the rear of the detector wall. All wires are parallel and
are spaced by 2.5 mm in each plane. The total detector gap is 36 mm, and
a negative potential can be applied to the front window of the detector. The
detector is ﬁlled with 1 bar of CF4 and 100 mbar of He-3. The anodes are
polarized at 1750 V and the cathodes are put to ground potential, as are the
walls of the detector except for the front window, which is put to -500V.

The calculation of the potential can be done analytically in this prismatic
set up, if one uses the conformal mapping (with F the elliptic integral of the
ﬁrst kind1 and am its inverse function, the Jacobi Amplitude):

w(z) = 21.7939F (arcsin(z), k2 = 0.81561)

and its inverse:

z(w) = sin(am(0.0458844w, k2 = 0.81561))

which maps the rectangle in w of width 100mm and height 36mm describing
the detector cross section into the upper half plane in z, see [3].

The potential in the z plane takes on the form [6], [8]:

giving us the solution V (z) in the z-plane, and hence the correct electrostatic
potential φ(w) = V (z(w)) in the detector volume.

The drift ﬁeld (between the front window and the cathode plane) then turns
out to be equal to 216 V/cm, which gives rise to an electron drift speed of about
4cm/µs according to Magboltz [9]. Given that in the gas mixture, the ionization
trace has a total length of about 5.6mm [10], this means that the longest charge
deposition times (when the trace is parallel to the drift ﬁeld) are about 140ns.

3 Experimental observation of d-t-o-t.

We have a ﬁrst order trans-impedance ampliﬁer, with unit response

τ being equal to 120ns in our case (this has been veriﬁed experimentally).

We can expect, from the signal maximum onward, an exponentially decreas-
ing signal, assuming that, as long as there is an avalanche going on, the signal
will still rise (during a time which is less than 140ns). There is then a very
simple relationship between this decrease-time-over-threshold (d-t-o-t) Te as a
function of the ratio 1/n of the threshold and the signal maximum:

v1(t)

∼

−t/τ

e

Te(n) = τ ln n

It would be the same as the genuine time over threshold (t-o-t) if the rise time
were negligible (impulse response). So Te(n) is a theoretical relationship between
the ratio of the maximum amplitude of a signal to a ﬁxed threshold value, n,
and a duration, and this duration ought to be equal to the t-o-t of a ﬁrst order
system when the rise time is negligible, or equal to the d-t-o-t of a ﬁrst order
system, even when the rise time is not negligible. The t-o-t, in such a case, will
then be the sum of the d-t-o-t and the rise time.

Signals have been recorded using a digital oscilloscope with 8 bit vertical
resolution and a sample period of 5ns. We will work with the ’decrease time
over threshold’, which is the time measured from the moment the signal reaches
its maximum to the time it falls below the threshold value. As said before, for
a ﬁrst order system, t-o-t and d-t-o-t are equal when the rise time is negligible.
We now deﬁne the ratio ρ of the experimentally measured d-t-o-t to what we
expect using equation 5, with n = Vmax/Vthresh,

ρ(n) =

d-t-o-t(n)
Te(n)

ρ(n) measures the deviation from the exponential model; we expect ρ(n) = 1
if the simple exponential model is correct. Experimentally, we ﬁnd the result
displayed in ﬁgure 1. Clearly, some aspect of the signal is not understood,
because equation 5 seems to predict times which are about a factor of 2 below
the measured values. We strongly suspect that the residual induced currents
by ion movement are at least partially responsible for this prolongation, and we
will work out their eﬀect theoretically using a simple model to verify whether
we obtain the right order of magnitude correction.

4 The induced signal.

The electrostatic situation around wire 8 in our test chamber allows us to es-
tablish the current induction from radial ion movement. Looking at the applied
potential around anode wire 8, we see that up to about 200µm we have a nice
isotropic ln(r) behavior as shown in ﬁgure 2 ; after that, the potential becomes
more involved and direction-dependent.

If, in order to apply the Shockley-Ramo theorem [7], we bring the 8th anode
wire to 1V and all the rest to 0V, we see in ﬁgure 3 that the sensing potential
around that anode goes in ln(r) to a signiﬁcant distance from the wire (at least
500µm).

So up to about 20 anode wire radii3, we can write, for the applied electric

surface of the anode wire (and which are proportional to the respective charges
calculated on the wire). For the applied ﬁeld in the test detector, we ﬁnd

a = 200kV /cm.

Next we determine the ion movement in this ﬁeld. Let us ﬁrst treat the low
ﬁeld case and assume constant ion mobility µ. In that case, the induced current
in the anode wire is given by:

and we are in exactly the same situation as the standard signal development in
a cylindrical proportional counter, treated for example in [7]. The solution is
given by:

The problem the authors have for the CF4-He-3 gas mixture is that no value for
the ion mobility seems to be available in the literature. However, if we assume
a mobility of the order of 1cm2/V s which is a typical mobility for many gasses
in n.c.
3ns. The ampliﬁer time constant (of the ﬁrst order
system) is 120 ns, so at ﬁrst sight, t0 is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller
than τ and can be thought to be negligible.

[11] we ﬁnd t0 ≃

If we treat the high ﬁeld limit, which is probably more appropriate for the
actual ﬁeld strengths, and where the ion velocity is proportional to the square

their charge.

i(t) = α

Ea(r)Es(r)

Working out the diﬀerential equation, we ﬁnd again the same structure for the
time dependence:

so we can again deﬁne a constant t0:

i(t) =

The authors didn’t ﬁnd any indication of the value of this constant in the
p
literature. We can make an educated guess in the following way: t0 in the high

ﬁeld limit over t0 in the low ﬁeld limit is equal to 4

strength which separates the high ﬁeld and the low ﬁeld region (of the order of
50KV /cm). This then leads to a high ﬁeld t0 value of the order of 8ns.

The important point, however, is that no matter whether we work with the
high ﬁeld or the low ﬁeld approximation, the analytical form of the induced
current is the same.

5 Electronic response with ﬁrst-order system.

In the previous section, we tried to argue that the impulse response of the linear
system ”electron arrives in avalanche region” to ”current induced in anode wire”
takes on the form:

i(t) =

1
t + t0

and this both in the low ﬁeld case and the high ﬁeld case (but with diﬀerent
values of t0).

Using our ﬁrst order electronic response as in equation 4 which converts this

current signal into a voltage signal, we obtain as an overall impulse response:

6 Time-over-threshold in our model.

We will now calculate the ratio ρ(n) of the d-t-o-t of our model given in equation
14 over the simple result of equation 5. The results are shown in ﬁgure 4, for
diﬀerent values of the ratio t0/τ .

In our measurements, we had an ampliﬁer which was AC coupled, with a
time constant θ
195.0τ . This AC coupling has a time constant which is
more than two orders of magnitude larger than τ and could be thought of being
negligible. If we use equation 15 with this value, we see in ﬁgure 5 that there
is nevertheless a very strong inﬂuence on the d-t-o-t due to this AC coupling as
compared to DC coupling in ﬁgure 4.

≃

Comparing these model predictions to our experimental results of ﬁgure 1,
although one cannot talk about a fully quantitative agreement5, the calculated
values of ρ are in the right ballpark (around a factor of 2) for reasonable values
of the unknown parameter t0. This strongly suggests that the ion movement
has a non-negligible inﬂuence on the t-o-t measurements.

7 Conclusion

Starting from the observation that a ﬁrst order model of the electronics makes
predictions of t-o-t which are about a factor of 2 smaller than what is exper-
imentally measured on a test MWPC, we tried to explain the origin of this
discrepancy with a simple model of the current induced by the ion movement.
This comparison indicates that the signal induced by residual ion movement
has to be taken into account when modeling t-o-t systems using a MWPC, even

5The fact that for small values of n, the experimental curve rises is simply due to the ﬁnite
charge collection time (which can be of the order of 140 ns) which lengthens the experimental
d-t-o-t for small values of n and hence small values of time.

when time scales of τ and t0 diﬀer by 2 orders of magnitude. As a side result,
it is also shown that an AC coupling, even with a large time constant, also has
a strong inﬂuence on the t-o-t; in this case, the t-o-t values are shortened.

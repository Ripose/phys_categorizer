A Geant4 hadronic process veriﬁcation suite has been designed to test and optimize Geant4 hadronic models
in the cascade energy range. It focuses on quantities relevant to the LHC radiation environment and spallation
source targets. The general structure of the suite is presented, including the user interface, stages of veriﬁcation,
management of experimental data, event generation, and comparison of results to data. Veriﬁcation results for
the newly released Binary cascade and Bertini cascade models are presented.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Geant4 toolkit [1] includes a collection of mod-
els and packages for hadronic physics which are ap-
plicable to various particle transport problems [2]. In
Geant4, ﬁnal state generation is separated from the
access and use of cross sections and from tracking. It is
therefore possible and desirable to have independent,
alternative physics models. In order to optimize these
models and to identify their most appropriate applica-
tion, detailed comparisons between experimental data
and model predictions are required.

The cascade energy region from the reaction thresh-
old to incident hadron energies of a few GeV is prob-
lematic for all existing Monte Carlo packages. In order
to verify and further develop Geant4 models in this en-
ergy range, a veriﬁcation suite has been created. The
stages of the veriﬁcation, including experimental data
handling, event generation and comparison to data
are described here. Results of the comparison are also
presented.

2. VERIFICATION SUITE

2.1. Method

The veriﬁcation suite is generic, as it is based on
an abstract interface to a ﬁnal state hadronic interac-
tion generator. This interface can be found in Level
2 of the Geant4 hadronic physics framework [3].
It
focuses on quantities relevant to the LHC radiation
environment and spallation source targets.

The modular structure of Geant4 allows the gener-
ation of single events with a known incident particle
energy and an explicitly deﬁned hadronic ﬁnal state
generator. The kinematics of secondaries produced in
the interaction are analyzed and the resulting angu-
lar, momentum, energy, and baryon number spectra
are stored in histograms. The energy-momentum bal-
ance can be controlled as well. The histograms are

compared to published measurements of the diﬀer-
ential and double diﬀerential cross sections, dσ/dE,
dσ/dΩ, d2σ/dEdΩ, and the invariant cross sections,
Ed3σ/d3p.

The cross section contributing to the i-th bin of the

histogram are given by

∆σi = σtotNi/N,

(1)

where σtot is the total cross section for the interaction
being tested, N is the number of simulated events
in the sample, and Ni is the number of times bin i
is incremented during the run. Each bin represents
a small region of phase space such as ∆Ω, ∆E, or
∆Ω∆E, into which the secondary particle goes after
being produced in the interaction. The double diﬀer-
ention cross section is estimatated as

d2σ
dEdΩ

=

∆σi
∆E∆Ω

.

(2)

The veriﬁcation suite is organized into a number of
test cases, each deﬁned by a unique incident beam en-
ergy and a single target nucleus. All data ﬁles, macro
ﬁles, kumac ﬁles and results for each case are stored
in a separate subdirectory. The AIDA abstract inter-
face [4] is used in the suite for histogram creation and
ﬁlling. The output is done in ASCII and HBOOK
formats.

2.2. Cross Sections

The veriﬁcation is done by comparing simulation
results with experimental data mainly from the EX-
FOR database [5]. Only data with absolute measure-
ments of the diﬀerential cross sections are utilized in
the suite. The data downloaded from the database are
re-formatted in order to provide intermediate ﬁles ac-
ceptable for PAW analysis. In some cases re-binning
of the data was performed during this process. This
was required mainly for the low energy part of the

spectra. If, within a given test case, only double dif-
ferential cross section data are available, the single
diﬀerential cross sections are obtained by numerical
integration.

Initial veriﬁcations have been performed for neu-
trons and pions produced by protons incident upon
various targets. For these test cases the initial proton
energies were all below 1 GeV. In this energy region
the inclusive reaction channel

p + A → n + X,

(3)

has been studied experimentally for many years. The
secondary neutrons can be identiﬁed and their ener-
gies can be measured with good precision by using
time-of-light techniques. Because this reaction is im-
portant for many applications, a signiﬁcant number of
test cases have been created for it (Table I).

For HEP applications and in particular for the LHC
detector, simulating secondary pion production is im-
portant. Model veriﬁcation for pion production by
incident protons is available for several test cases (Ta-
ble II) for the reactions

p + A → π

±

+ X.

2.3. User Interface

The user interface is implemented by macro ﬁles
which allow the speciﬁcation of various parameters of
the veriﬁcation. These include:

• initial particle and its energy,

• beam energy spread,

• target nucleus,

• hadronic interaction generator,

• generator options, and

• histogram types and bins.

Both linear and logarithmic binning are available.
Each veriﬁcation test case contains a script which exe-
cutes the macro ﬁles. Hence the user can perform the
complete veriﬁcation process by issuing a single com-
mand. The results are stored in HBOOK format and
can be processed in PAW by prepared kumac ﬁles.

3. HADRONIC MODELS

The veriﬁcation suite has been used extensively dur-
ing the release phase of the new Geant4 Bertini cas-
cade and Binary cascade packages [2]. The Bertini
cascade model is a classical cascade code which was
described in detail at another presentation at this con-
ference [6].

The Binary cascade introduces a new approach to
cascade calculations. The interaction is modeled ex-
clusively on binary scattering between reaction par-
ticipants and nucleons. The nucleus is described by
a detailed 3-dimensional model in which the nucleons
are explicitly positioned in phase space. Free hadron-
hadron elastic and reaction cross sections are used to
deﬁne the collisions. Propagation of the particles in
the nuclear ﬁeld is done by numerically solving the the
equation of motion.

The cascade begins with a projectile and a descrip-
tion of the nucleus, and terminates when the both
average and maximum energy of all particles within
the nuclear boundary are below a given threshold.
The remaining nuclear fragment is treated by pre-
equilibrium decay and de-excitation models [7].

4. RESULTS OF VERIFICATION

4.1. Inclusive neutron spectra

The single and the double diﬀerential inclusive neu-
tron spectra are very sensitive to the physics model
used in the cascade code. As shown in Fig. 1, the
Binary cascade reproduces the data rather well for all
targets, except for energies below 50 MeV where neu-
tron evaporation is important. In contrast, the Bertini
cascade (Fig.2) does well below 50 MeV for all but the
lightest nuclei. Above 50 MeV only the general trend
of the data is reproduced, while the overall normal-
ization improves as A increases.

Fig. 3 shows forward scattering in which the proton
transfers its energy to one target neutron. Here the
Binary cascade describes the data above 50 MeV. The
Bertini cascade (Figs.4) does less well, signiﬁcantly
underestimating the data at higher neutron energies.
This discrepancy is reduced for heavier nuclei.

Additional veriﬁcation test cases indicate that the
Binary cascade approach is reasonably accurate for
other angles and energies as well. Fig. 5 shows com-
parisons for aluminum at forward and backward neu-
tron angles at energies of 113, 256, 585 and 800 MeV.
At 113 and 256 MeV, agreement at all angles is good.
At 585 and 800 MeV the backward angle spectra are
not well-reproduced. The same set of plots is shown in
Fig. 6 for iron, and in Fig. 7 for lead. For both targets
the same trends apply as were observed in aluminum.

4.2. Pion production

Another useful test of the cascade codes is to look
at the double diﬀerential cross sections for the produc-
tion of π+ and π−. Experimental cross sections show
that π+ production by protons is signiﬁcantly larger
than that for π−. This feature is well-reproduced by
the Binary cascade as shown in Fig.8. The trend of
the cross section versus energy is also reproduced, al-
though the overall normalization is underestimated by
a factor of 2-3 for carbon, aluminum and nickel.

Similar plots for π+ and π− are shown for an inci-
dent proton energy of 730 MeV. Figs.9 and 10 show
π− and π+ at forward and backward angles from alu-
minum, while Figs. 11 and 12 show π− and π+ from

to π− production is reproduced. As was the case for
597 MeV incident protons (Fig. 8), the trend of cross

section versus energy is also reproduced. However at
730 MeV it is seen that the Binary cascade does an
increasingly poor job of reproducing the overall nor-
malization as the pion angle increases.

4.3. Future veriﬁcation work

While the existing veriﬁcation suite has already
been used extensively,
further development is re-
quired. So far the validity of the cascade codes has
only been demonstrated for incident protons at the
low end of their energy ranges. In order to test the
full range of energies and particles, many more test

• incident proton energies up to 15 GeV,

• incident pion energies up to 15 GeV.

• proton inclusive spectra.

5. CONCLUSIONS

A veriﬁcation suite for hadronic interaction models
in the cascade energy region has been designed and
implemented. This suite has been used both to de-
velop the Bertini and Binary cascade model codes for
the Geant4 toolkit and to compare their predictions
with data from thin target scattering experiments.

The suite has proved to be an eﬃcient tool for
model validation which can be used for the devel-
opment and testing of other hadronic interaction
models. The suite is also being expanded to include
tests for more types of incident particles and higher
energies.

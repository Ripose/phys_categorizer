Abstract

The original Lindhard-Scharﬀ-Schiøtt (LSS) theory and the more recent Tilinin theory for calculating the nuclear
and electronic stopping powers of slow heavy ions are compared with predictions from the SRIM code by Ziegler.
While little discrepancies are present for the nuclear contribution to the energy loss, large diﬀerences are found in
the electronic one. When full ion recoil cascade simulations are tested against the elastic neutron scattering data
available in the literature, it can be concluded that the LSS theory is the more accurate.

Key words: Energy loss, Stopping power, Nuclear recoils, Dark matter.

1. Introduction

It is well known that an ion moving inside a
medium can loose energy by collisions with both
the electrons and the nuclei. Theoretically, it is
necessary to account for both processes to reach
an accurate description of the energy loss below
a few keV/amu. From the experimental point of
view, most detectors are sensitive only to electronic
energy loss. Knowledge of the energy loss sharing
between the two processes is required to fully un-
derstand the response to particles interacting with

the detector medium through nuclear recoils. This
is the case for Weakly Interacting Massive Parti-
cles (WIMPs), which are possible constituents of
the galactic dark matter.

The purpose of the present work is to explore the
diﬀerent available descriptions for the two parts
of the energy loss between 1 and 100 keV. Range
measurements are diﬃcult at such low energies and
almost all published data have been obtained us-
ing elastic neutron scattering for transferring small
and known amounts of energy to atoms of the de-
tection material. To reduce the theoretical diﬃcul-
ties, the attention is focused on pure substances:
hence only symmetric projectile/target atom com-
binations will be investigated. From all the avail-

able measurements, known to the authors, the fol-
lowing are then selected: Si [3,4], Ge [5,6], and liq-
uid Xe [7,8,9,10]. Liquid Ar will also be considered
on account of its interest for dark matter searches.
Among the few calculations from ﬁrst principles
without free parameters, there are still the origi-
nal theory of Lindhard [1] and its reevaluation by
Tilinin [2]; they will be examined here.

From all the available codes, only SRIM [11] will
be discussed, because: i) it gives separately nuclear
and electronic energy losses, ii) it covers the low
energy range of interest, iii) from an independent
survey [12] it was found the most accurate.

2. The nuclear stopping power

to

According

the Lindhard-Scharﬀ-Schiøtt
(LSS) theory [1], the nuclear stopping power Sn
of a heavy ion is best described by rescaling its
energy E and range R to the non-dimensional
variables ǫ and ρ, respectively, deﬁned as

ǫ = CTF

E/(2 EB)

and Atot = AP + AT . In
with Z = Z
Eq. (1) N is the number density of the target ma-
terial, ZP and AP are the atomic and atomic mass
numbers of the projectile atom, respectively, ZT
and AT are the correspondents for the target atom,
aB is the Bohr radius, EB the Bohr energy and CTF
the Thomas-Fermi constant (9π2/27)1/3. In fact,
while the nuclear part of the energy loss (dE/dx)n
depends on the projectile and target ions, (dǫ/dρ)n
depends on the Thomas-Fermi interaction poten-
tial alone and is a universal function f (ǫ) that can
be calculated numerically [13]. The values of Sn
are reproduced with the physical units in Fig. 1.

A similar rescaling is employed in SRIM (Z in
all appearances in Eq. (1) is replaced by an empir-
ical Z 1/2 = Z 0.23
), but now the universal
function f (ǫ) is determined not from ﬁrst princi-
ples but from a ﬁt to experimental data. The re-
sults are also shown in Fig. 1.

While diﬀerences are small, it is known from
sputtering data [14] that the original LSS the-
ory overestimates Sn. This problem is reduced in
SRIM, as it is based on data themselves. Lindhard
et al. [13] had already warned that the Thomas-
Fermi treatment might not be adequate for very
low energies (i.e. ǫ < 10−2), where mostly the tails
of the ion-ion potential are probed. In the present
study this is of concern only for Xe below 15 keV.

3. The electronic stopping power

The electronic energy loss (dE/dx)e of a single
charged particle at a low velocity β was described
as an interaction with an electron plasma in the
original work of Fermi and Teller. They explicitly
distinguished two cases, for β above and below
the Fermi velocity βF . For β < βF , (dE/dx)e was
found to be proportional to β, with a proportion-
ality coeﬃcient being a unique function of the elec-
tron plasma density n0, usually expressed in terms
of the Wigner-Seitz radius rs = (3n0/(4π))1/3 [15].
Their result is plotted in Fig. 2. Typically, rs needs
to be corrected because tightly bound electrons
contribute only marginally to (dE/dx)e. In crys-
tals, like Si and Ge, this eﬀective density of the
free electron plasma can be deduced from optical
properties [16]. In liquids, like Ar and Xe, the prob-
lem is much more diﬃcult and no correction was
attempted in Fig. 2. Successively, Lindhard calcu-
lated in a self consistent way the local increase in
the electron plasma density around the intruder

particle due to its Coulomb ﬁeld. This leads to a
higher (dE/dx)e as can be seen in Fig. 2. Finally,
Ritchie considered the case where the Coulomb
ﬁeld is exponentially screened, slightly decreasing
(dE/dx)e (see Fig. 2). The last eﬀect is of partic-
ular relevance for ions, which can accommodate
bound states while sweeping through the electron
plasma. For a bare heavy ion, a scaling of Z 2
P with
respect to the elementary particle case is expected,
as assumed in Fig. 2. In reality, this is not correct
and the theory was extended to a partially ionized
intruder by Ferrell and Ritchie [15], but the de-
termination of the ionization level of a given ion
remains a diﬃcult task. Lindhard also indepen-
dently investigated this problem [1] and, using the
Thomas-Fermi theory, arrived at a closed form for
the proportionality coeﬃcient. In terms of the non-
dimensional variables introduced in Eq. (1), his re-
sult can be expressed as (dǫ/dρ)e = κ √ǫ where

(which is regarded only as an ap-
with ξe ≈
proximation by Lindhard). The points correspond-
ing to the projectile/target combination of interest
for the present study are also reported in Fig. 2,
where the suppression of the electronic energy loss
occurs mostly due to the partial ionization of the
intruder. It strongly increases with ZP (ZP = ZT ).
The proportionality of (dE/dx)e with β is
also included in SRIM, allowing a value of
(dE/dx)e/(β Z 2
P ) to be extracted (see Fig. 2).
While SRIM exceeds the LSS theory for Si, it then
decreases consistently below it, up to a factor of 4
for Xe. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear,
as details on the implementation of (dE/dx)e for
low velocities in SRIM are not public, but it prob-
ably resides in the estimate of the charge state
of the intruder. It has been veriﬁed that data for
protons of comparable energies per nucleon on Ar
and Xe are well reproduced by SRIM.

The big drawback of the described theoretical
approaches is to assume that the electronic and
nuclear collisions as uncorrelated [1]. In reality,
the screened Coulomb repulsion of the two col-
liding nuclei makes part of the range of impact
parameters unavailable for the scattering of the

electrons belonging to the target atom in the
screened Coulomb ﬁeld of the projectile and vice
versa. Tilinin [2] has shown that the ﬁnal net eﬀect
is a great decrease of Se for ǫ
1, with a corre-
sponding lack of proportionality to √ǫ. His results
can also be recast in the form of Eq. (2) where ξe
is replaced by a function τ (ǫ, ZP /ZT ) that can be
tabulated [2]. In the present case his theory pre-
dicts roughly half the value of Se expected from
LSS and SRIM for Si and approximately agrees
with SRIM for Xe.

4. The full ion recoil cascade

As mentioned, resort must be made to elastic
neutron scattering. Since what is really recorded is
the fraction of the total energy transferred to elec-
trons, eventually detectable as excitation or ioniza-
tion, it should be remembered that recombination
or quenching may inﬂuence the ﬁnal result, par-
ticularly in the case of scintillation yield for LXe.
Theoretically, however, an even bigger disadvan-
tage is present; especially for high Z elements: Sn
dominates over Se, and most of the primary ion
energy is transferred to the recoil of an ion in the
target material. The knocked ion undergoes the
same processes, resulting in a full cascade of re-
coils, whose total electronic energy loss must be
evaluated. In the case of the SRIM code, a second
program (TRIM [11]) takes Sn and Se from the
ﬁrst and performs the computation. Lindhard and
his group solved numerically the transport equa-

tions corresponding to the LSS theory and found
a parameterization of the results in terms of the
non dimensional energy ǫ and the parameter κ (see
Eq. (9) of Ref. [17]). Both results are compared
with data in Fig. 3 (the two series of points for
Ge are inconsistent). The LSS theory is on average
better, while SRIM both overpredicts and strongly
underpredicts the data for Si and Xe, respectively.
While the ﬁrst discrepancy could be ascribed to
recombination, the second appears even more sur-
prising due to the probable presence of quenching.

5. Conclusions

≈

For slow heavy ions, the nuclear stopping power
predicted by the original LSS theory and the cur-
rent SRIM code diﬀer at most by
15%. On the
contrary, for the electronic stopping power, big dis-
crepancies are present between the LSS theory, the
theory of Tilinin and SRIM (up to a factor of
4
for Xe). Judging from the elastic neutron scatter-
ing data, the LSS theory seems the best of all. More
detailed full cascade simulations will be performed
in the future to assess the robustness of this conclu-
sion. New experimental data for Germanium would
be highly needed for clarifying the situation.

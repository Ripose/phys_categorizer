Abstract

A novel charged particle tracking device, a high precision time projection chamber
with gas electron multiplier and pad readout, is a leading candidate as the cen-
tral tracker for an experiment at the International Linear Collider. To characterize
the performance of such a system, a small TPC has been operated within a mag-
netic ﬁeld, measuring cosmic-ray and laser tracks. Good tracking resolution and two
particle separation, suﬃcient for a large scale ILC central tracker, are achieved.

Key words: time projection chamber, gas electron multiplier
PACS: 29.40.Cs, 29.40.Gx

1 Introduction

Time projection chambers (TPCs) have been an important part of many large
particle physics experiments since their initial development in the 1970’s. [1,2]
Traditionally, ionization tracks are imaged at the endplates with wire grids,
which provide gas ampliﬁcation, and pads. The signals sensed on anode wires
and cathode pads are predominantly due to the motion of positive ions away
from the gas ampliﬁcation region. When operated in a magnetic ﬁeld parallel
to the drift ﬁeld, the momentum resolution of the device is limited by non-zero
E
B [3] in the vicinity of the wire grids. The multi-track resolution is limited
by the wide pad response function and the slow drift velocity of the positive
ions.

A time projection chamber is a leading candidate to be the main tracker for an
International Linear Collider experiment. [4] In order to improve the momen-
tum and multi-track resolutions, as required by the physics objectives, it has
been proposed that the wire grids be replaced by a micropattern gas avalanche
detector, such as a gas electron multiplier (GEM) [5] or micromegas [6]. For
these types of devices, E
B can be negligibly small. Furthermore, since the
pad signals are due to the motion of electrons as they approach and arrive on
the readout pads, the spatial extent of the signals can be much narrower and
their risetimes much faster, thereby improving the multi-track resolution.

×

In fact, the signals can be so narrow as to present a challenge for conven-
tional pad readout in a large detector. The outer radius of a linear collider
experiment main tracker is envisaged to be approximately 2 m and to keep
electronics costs reasonable, the readout pads need to be no smaller than
about 2 mm
6 mm. [4] A strong magnetic ﬁeld of 4 T is being considered
to reach the momentum resolution goal. In this magnetic ﬁeld, gases with fast
drift velocity at low drift ﬁelds can have transverse diﬀusion contants of about
30 µm/√cm. To achieve optimal transverse resolution with 2 mm wide pads,
a mechanism to defocus the drifting electron charge cloud after ampliﬁcation
is required, so that the signals are sampled by at least 2 pads per row.

×

One way to defocus the charge cloud is to use gas diﬀusion between the GEM
foils and the readout pads. In these regions the electric ﬁeld can be much
larger and by selecting an appropriate gas, the diﬀusion constant can be much
larger there than in the drift region. This is the method that is investigated
in the work reported here. Ideally, the defocusing should be suﬃcient so that
the standard deviation of the charge clouds should be at least 1
1
3 of the
pad width, as explained in appendix A. An alternative defocusing method,
particularly well suited for micromegas devices, is to place a resistive foil
above the pads. [7]

The remaining sections of the paper describe studies with a TPC consisting
of a drift volume coupled to a double GEM structure and conventional pads.
In section 2, the design and general properties of the TPC and the laser
delivery system are described. The data samples collected with this device are
summarized in section 3, and the general properties of the data are shown.
Section 4 describes a program used to simulate cosmic and laser tracks in
the TPC, which was used to develop and test reconstruction algorithms. In
section 5 the methods employed to ﬁt tracks of ionization in the TPC are
described in detail. Section 6 shows the performance of the TPC, as measured
under a variety of operating conditions, and compares these to results from
simulations.

closed gas volume. The readout module shows the 8 front end cards of the electronics
readout system inserted.

2 TPC and laser system

After gaining experience operating a 15 cm drift length TPC with GEM read-
out without magnetic ﬁelds [8], a new TPC was designed with a 30 cm drift
length, speciﬁcally to be deployed in magnets available for use at the TRIUMF
and DESY laboratories in 2003. Following successful cosmic ray tests in the
magnets that year, a laser delivery system was constructed for further tests
with the TPC in the DESY magnet in 2004.

2.1 TPC design

The TPC is a cylindrical design, constructed primarily with acrylic. The drift
length is 30 cm with a ﬁeld cage of brass hoops with a pitch of 5 mm held in
slots in an acrylic holder. The potentials of the hoops are provided by a chain
of 10 MΩ surface mount resistors in the gas volume. The cathode endpiece is a
circular piece of G10 with copper cladding. The other end of the drift volume
is terminated by a circular endpiece with a 10 cm square hole, equal to the
size of the GEM foils. The endpiece has copper cladding, and narrow wires
strung across the hole, to provide a well deﬁned termination of the electric
ﬁeld. The drift volume section of the TPC is inserted into an outer acrylic
cylinder, with an outer diameter of 8.75 in. A readout module, holding a pad
array constructed on a printed circuit board and two GEM foils, is inserted
into the cylinder on the other end, to make a closed gas volume. The readout
and drift modules design drawings are shown in Fig. 1.

toring the voltages. Not shown are the isolated voltmeters across shunts to monitor
the GEM currents.

2.2 Drift ﬁeld and GEM operation

A schematic diagram of the high voltage conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 2. All
resistors shown are installed in a HV distribution box, except for the ﬁeld
cage network, which are surface mount resistors located in the TPC volume.
The HV distribution box also contained 100 kΩ shunt resistors on one line to
each GEM, to which isolated digital voltmeters are attached. This allowed for
current monitoring at the level of 1 nA on each GEM.

During data taking, electric ﬁelds in the drift volume were 90-250 V/cm,
chosen to maximize the drift velocity, and the ﬁeld between the drift endpiece
and GEM 1 was 10 V/cm larger. The transfer ﬁeld between the two GEMs
was about 2.5 kV/cm, and the induction ﬁeld to the readout pads was about
3.5 kV/cm. The potential across each GEM was 370-380 V, providing an
eﬀective gas gain of the system in the range 5-8

103.

2.3 Readout electronics

An array of rectangular readout pads, roughly 10 mm2 in area are laid out
on a printed circuit board, arranged in rows of 31 or 32 pads across. The
pads are at nominal ground potential, and each row is connected to a front
end card developed for the STAR TPC [9]. The card contains charge sensitive

ﬁeld rings, by a movable mirror, and optionally by a movable beam splitter.

preampliﬁers-shapers and when a trigger is received, the ampliﬁed signals are
sampled and stored into a 512 time bin switched capacitor array. The card
was modiﬁed to increase the pedestal to allow negative going pulses to be
sampled with a large dynamic range. The signals are digitized asynchronously
and 10 bits per channel per 50 ns time bin are stored in the raw data ﬁles.
For cosmic ray studies, trigger signals are formed from the coincidence of
scintillator paddles placed above and below the TPC. For laser studies, trigger
signals are provided by a photodiode.

2.4 Laser system

In order to perform controlled studies of the GEM TPC, a laser delivery
system was constructed for use in the DESY magnet system with an ultraviolet
(266 nm wavelength) Nd:YAG laser. The system is able to provide a single
beam or a pair of beams to the TPC perpendicular to the drift direction, at
any location along the drift distance, under remote control. The TPC outer
acrylic tube was ﬁtted with long quartz windows to accept the laser light. A
schematic drawing is shown in Fig. 3.

The beam from the laser is reﬂected by two fused silica slides (each with the
back face sandblasted to reduce ghost reﬂections) to reduce the beam intensity

5

−

30 mm plano-concave lens followed by a F = 100 mm
and focused by a F =
plano-convex lens. The beam is split, with the reﬂected beam providing a
ﬁxed direction, and the through going beam reﬂected oﬀ a movable mirror to
provide a second beam parallel to the ﬁxed beam. The separation of the two
beams can be adjusted to between 0 and 12 mm. Beam blockers can move
into or out of either beam to provide a single beam to the TPC.

When the TPC is placed in the laser delivery system holder, a movable splitter
and mirror are underneath the TPC to reﬂect the beam into the TPC volume
at two drift distances simultaneously. The splitter can be rotated out of the
beam so that the light enters at only one drift distance. A steering mirror was
also in place to allow a transverse separation of beams that enter at two drift
distances.

Remote control was provided through the use of servos and stepper motors
controlled via the serial and parallel ports of the data acquisition computer.
Operation under remote control was necessary for personal safety considera-
tions regarding the strong magnetic ﬁeld and the ultraviolet laser.

3 Data samples and characteristics

In 2003, cosmic ray data were collected at a variety of magnetic ﬁeld strengths
for two diﬀerent gas mixtures: P5 (Ar:CH4 95:5) and a mixture referred to as
TDR-gas (Ar:CH4:CO2 95:3:2). The pad pitch was 2 mm
7 mm. Initial
tests were performed in the 1 T warm magnet at TRIUMF followed by a
longer data taking period in the superconducting magnet at DESY. Two of
the electronics cards were faulty during much of the data taking run, but
6 rows were found to provide suﬃcient information to characterize the tracking
resolution performance.

×

×

In 2004, cosmic ray and laser calibration data were collected primarily at a
magnetic ﬁeld of 4 T at DESY, with the same two gas mixtures. Two readout
pad boards were used: the original with 2 mm
7 mm pads, and a new
×
7 mm pads. The study with the narrower pads was
board with 1.2 mm
performed because it was found in the 2003 run that neither gas provides
adequate defocusing between the GEM foils for the 2 mm wide pads at high
magnetic ﬁelds. Gas mixtures with higher concentrations of methane, such
as P10, could provide the required defocusing at 4 T, but this gas was not
permitted in the DESY magnet test area. The initial data taking in 2004 was
with the wider pads, after which the TPC was brieﬂy opened to insert the
narrow pad plane. The data taking started with P5 gas when it was found
that the drift velocity at 90 V/cm, where it is expected to be maximum, was
found to be much lower than expected and increasing with time. By operating

at 160 V/cm, the drift velocity was maximised and found to be stable. After
the data taking period was completed, it was found that long lengths of the
gaslines were copper that had been previously exposed to atmosphere, and a
gas analyzer showed that under these conditions, signiﬁcant amounts of water
remain in the system for a few weeks after starting the gas ﬂow. The drift
velocity and diﬀusion of TDR gas is less sensitive to water.

The 2003 data had several faulty electronics channels, unlike the 2004 data,
and since the laser system was only incorporated for the 2004 data set, the
focus of the data analysis reported in this paper is on the 2004 data samples,
summarized in table 1.

A typical cosmic ray event is illustrated in Fig. 4, along with representative
pulses on some of the pads. Pads near the center of the track have signals
due to the collected charge that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in shape than pads
further away, which have only signals induced by the motion of electrons in
the induction gap. Due to the shaping of the readout electronics, the induced
pulses are transformed into bipolar pulses.

To estimate the charge collected by pads, clusters of signals in a row are
searched for, and the time bin with the largest sum of signals in neighbouring
pads is taken to be the arrival time of the center of the electron cloud. For each
pad in the row, the sum of the pulse height in that time bin and the three
previous and three following time bins is formed to estimate the collected
charge. Studies show that the induced signals roughly cancel out with this
algorithm.

diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds, and the eﬀect of reduced diﬀusion in the drift volume
due to the magnetic ﬁeld is apparent.

4 Simulation

A simulation package was created in order to develop reconstruction methods
and better understand the various data distributions. [10] Ionization electrons
can be inserted into a gas volume either along a straight trajectory using
a parameterization of ionization ﬂuctuations (to simulate muon tracks) or
Poisson ﬂuctuations (to simulate laser tracks), or along a realistic trajectory
by using the energy loss of particles traversing the gas, as calculated by the
GEANT3 [11] program. For most of the simulation studies presented here, the
latter approach was used with GEANT3 description of the DESY test setup
and a cosmic muon generator [13], in order to reproduce the cosmic muon
acceptance.

The ionization electrons are transported in the gas towards the TPC endplate
according to a speciﬁed drift velocity and diﬀused according to given transverse
and longitudinal diﬀusion constants. The electrons enter the GEM foil holes,
with a given collection eﬃciency, are ampliﬁed according to either a Poisson
or an exponential gain function, and exit the holes with a given extraction
eﬃciency. Between the foils and between the second foil and the pad plane they
diﬀuse, with generally larger diﬀusion constants. The electrons are collected
by an array of pads, and the pad signals are shaped, digitized, and saved in
simulated data ﬁles that can be analyzed by the same software that analyzes
the real data.

For the simulated samples shown in this paper, the drift velocity and dif-
fusion constants were set to be the values deduced from the data or from
Magboltz [12] simulations, the collection and extraction eﬃciencies set to 1,
and an exponential gain function assumed for each GEM foil.

5 Data Analysis

As part of the simulation package [10], methods were developed to ﬁnd and
reconstruct ionization tracks. A simple track ﬁnder uses the largest clusters
from the outermost rows to deﬁne straight trajectories as a starting point for
the track ﬁtter. Track ﬁtting is performed separately in the readout pad plane
and in the vertical-drift plane. The spatial resolution is most critical in the
readout pad plane, since it directly determines the momentum resolution of a
TPC. To achieve the ultimate resolution, a special track ﬁtting algorithm was
developed, and is described in detail below. No channel by channel calibration
constants or empirical corrections were applied in the analysis.

9

5.1 Tracking in the pad readout plane

To accurately reconstruct the ionization tracks from the measurements of
charge collected by the readout pads, a maximum likelihood track ﬁtting al-
gorithm was developed. This takes into account the non-linear charge sharing
function, which is necessary to achieve good resolution when the pads are
as wide as the distribution of electrons arriving on the pads. An alternative
method, using a simple linear centroid determination of the track coordinates
as it crosses each row of pads, was found to perform poorly under these con-
ditions.

−

A right handed coordinate system is used to deﬁne a set of track parameters,
x0, φ0, 1/r, and σ, that describe ionization tracks projected into the pad
y plane is parallel to the pad plane and perpendicular
readout plane. The x
to the drift direction, the +y direction is the vertical direction, and the +z
direction is opposite to the drift direction. The choice of the coordinate origin,
(x = 0, y = 0, z = 0), is chosen to be at the centre of the readout pad array.
The location of the track as it crosses the x axis is x0 and its local azimuthal
angle at that location is φ0. Vertical tracks are assigned an angle φ0 = 0, and
positive angles correspond to right handed rotations of the track about the z
direction. To account for the helical trajectories of charged particles in an axial
magnetic ﬁeld, the inverse radius of curvature, 1/r, is included, with positive
values assigned to those whose centre of curvature is displaced with respect
to the track in the +x direction. The ﬁnal track parameter, σ, is the standard
deviation of the charge distribution about the trajectory as measured at the
pads.

The maximum likelihood track ﬁt is described in detail in appendix B. A
relatively simple model is used to describe the expected charge distribution
across the readout pads, given the track parameters deﬁned above. As usual,
estimates for the track parameters for each event are made by maximizing
the likelihood function. Provided enough rows of data are recorded and good
starting values for the parameters are used, the maximum of the likelihood
function is converged upon quickly using standard numerical techniques.

The second derivatives of the likelihood function can be used to estimate the
covariance of the track parameters. The error matrix elements estimated in
this fashion are sensitive to the model assumptions and its parameters, and
therefore the resolution are estimated directly from the data, by measuring
the standard deviation of residuals from repeated measurements.

One eﬀect that causes the errors estimated by the ﬁt to be underestimated is
the non-uniform ionization that occurs within a row. Except for tracks that
are parallel to pad boundaries, this increases the variance of the probability

10

density function for charge deposition on pads near the track. The resulting
degradation of track resolution for non-vertical tracks is referred to as the
“track angle eﬀect”. Another important eﬀect that degrades the resolution is
the variance of the single-electron response of the GEM, which reduces the
statistical power of the original ionization electrons.

One eﬀect that causes the errors to be overestimated is the model assumption
that the diﬀusion within and after the GEM structure is small. The observed
distribution of charge across the pads is used to estimate the diﬀusion of the
ionization electrons, whereas in reality, the distribution is due both to the
diﬀusion in the drift volume and the diﬀusion of the ampliﬁed electrons in the
GEM structure. Since the multinomial distribution that is used refers to the
original ionization electrons, the estimated uncertainties from the track ﬁt will
be overestimated.

5.2 Two track ﬁtting in the pad plane

If two ionization tracks are near enough, some pads will collect charge from
both tracks, and the tracking resolution for each track will degrade. To analyze
data with two nearby tracks, the maximum likelihood track ﬁt was modiﬁed
to include the charge from two tracks. To allow for non-uniform ionization
along the track direction, the ratio of the charges sampled from the two tracks
is treated as an additional nuisance parameter for each row. In other words,
the relative amplitudes of the pulses from each track are not assumed to be
one half, or some other ﬁxed value, but instead the relative amplitudes for
each row are varied in the maximization of the likelihood. In these studies,
the width of the charge distribution for each track, σ, is ﬁxed.

5.3 Tracking in the vertical-drift plane

In the vertical-drift plane, a more traditional approach is applied. For each
row, the drift time is determined and converted to drift distance. The set
of points deﬁned by the pad row centres and the drift distances are ﬁt to a
straight line, by minimizing the squares of the deviations.

5.4 Selection criteria

A study of noise present in all channels identiﬁed three bad channels for the
entire 2004 data run and a few single bad channels for subsets of the data run.
The information from these pads is ignored in the analyses presented here.

Events are selected containing a cluster of signals in each row, with the thresh-
old set to be typically over 99% eﬃcient per row for cosmic ray tracks. Multiple
track events are removed by requiring no more than one cluster per row. The
reconstructed track is required to have its x0 coordinate well within the ge-
ometric acceptance of the pads, and the azimuthal angle is required to be
< 0.1. Likewise, the z0 coordinate is required to be well within the drift
φ0
|
volume, and the dip angle λ is required satisfy,
< 0.6. A small number
of events are removed by excluding those with an anomalously large σ which
arise when a very large ionization, due to a delta ray, cause large induced sig-
nals on a large number of pads in a row. Finally a few events are removed by
requiring that the track ﬁt converge properly, and the estimated errors on x0
and σ be within a reasonable range, to ensure that the ﬁt results are sensible.

The drift velocity is quickly determined with the laser system by measuring
the arrival times of laser tracks at known drift distances. This was also used to
ensure that the drift velocity was relatively constant throughout a data run.

linear ﬁts to the data.

The diﬀusion properties of the gas, both in the drift volume and in the ampli-
ﬁcation section determine, to a large extent, the performance of the TPC. The
track parameter, σ, gives an indication of the diﬀusion present for each event.
Figure 6 shows the variance (σ2) for cosmic tracks at various drift distances
in TDR gas at B = 1 and 4 T. The dependence is linear, as expected from
diﬀusion.

An estimate of the diﬀusion constant, D, is given by the square root of the
slope and the defocusing, σ0, is given by the square root of the intercept.
When the technique is applied to simulated data, for a broad range of input
diﬀusion constants, the estimated diﬀusion constants are found to be about
10% too small, when the noise parameter, described in appendix B, pnoise is
set to 0.01. Furthermore, the discrepancy increases for larger noise parameter
values. The simulation, however, appears to describe the eﬀect, since the ratio
of diﬀusion constants in data to those in the simulated data is found to be
constant within 3% for 0.001 < pnoise < 0.05. Table 2 shows the results for
diﬀusion and defocusing as measured by the cosmic ray data collected in 2004,
compared to the expectation. The measured diﬀusion constants have been
corrected by scaling by a factor of 1.11

0.03.

±

The observed drift velocity and diﬀusion constants are in relatively good agree-
ment, apart from the diﬀusion at zero magnetic ﬁeld. The defocusing term is
larger in the data as compared to the simulation, for all data sets.

The energy loss of cosmic muons traversing the gas is measured using all 11
pad rows, including the three very wide pads. Shown in Fig. 7 is the truncated
mean number of electrons collected on a pad row per mm of path length

in calculating the truncated mean. It is seen that the GEANT3 simulation
gives a somewhat broader distribution than observed in the data. The increase
in dE/dx as a function of estimated momentum, as deduced by the track
curvature, is seen, as expected. Overall, the dE/dx resolution is approximately
17%. In comparison, an empirical relation [14] that reproduces the dE/dx
performance of many large scale experiments predicts 16% for this setup. The
modest resolution is a result of the short overall sampling length of 86 mm.

6.2 Track resolution in the pad plane

The likelihood track ﬁt procedure does not involve individual space points
along the length of the track, so there is no possibility to use the scatter of
such points to estimate the transverse resolution per point. Instead, the reso-
lution is deduced by comparing the transverse coordinate estimates from ﬁts
using diﬀerent sets of rows. First, the likelihood ﬁt to all 8 rows of data is
used to deﬁne a reference. Next, the data from a single row is used to esti-
mate the horizontal coordinate, in a ﬁt that leaves the other track parameters
ﬁxed according to the reference. This is done for all events in a data set and
the distribution of residuals, between the reference and the single row ﬁt, is
ﬁt to a single Gaussian to determine the standard deviation, σw. In general,
the residual distributions are found to be well described by a single Gaus-
sian. Because the data from the single row was used in the reference, σw will
underestimate the true resolution. To overcome this, the process is repeated,
but this time the reference ﬁt does not use the information from the single
row. The corresponding standard deviation, σwo, is an overestimate of the

true resolution because the reference track is not perfectly measured itself.
To properly estimate the resolution from a single row, the geometric mean of
these two standard deviations is used. This approach is exact for a traditional
least squares ﬁt [8], and is also found to work well in simulations and with the
laser data, as described in Appendix C.

The single row resolution for cosmic ray tracks measured in a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld
by the TPC is shown in Fig. 8 as a function of drift distance and compared to
the results from simulated data sets. For both gases, the resolution is improved
substantially by reducing the pad pitch from 2 mm to 1.2 mm, indicating that
the limited charge sharing for the wide pads is a signiﬁcant factor in the
resolution for those pads. Likewise, better resolution is seen in P5 gas than
TDR gas, which would be expected, given that the defocusing is larger in the
P5 gas, thereby providing more charge sharing. The overall resolutions, by
combining events from all drift distances are summarized in table 3.

The resolution is substantially poorer at lower magnetic ﬁelds as shown in
Fig. 9. A stronger dependence on drift distance is seen as expected, due to the
increased transverse diﬀusion constant for the gas at lower ﬁelds.

Figure 10 shows that the resolution degrades with increasing azimuthal angle,
as expected from the non-uniform ionization of cosmic rays. [8] The depen-
dence is stronger for the narrow pads than wide pads. The simulation has a
stronger dependence than seen in the data, which could be related to the fact
that the ionization ﬂuctuations appear to be larger in the simulation sample,
as shown in Fig. 7.

The dependence of the location that a track crosses a pad on the bias and
resolution for a pad row, is shown in Fig. 11. In the ﬁgures, the local pad

coordinate is the location of the reference track (ﬁt from all rows) as it crosses
the pad, represented as a fraction of the total pad width. A negative bias is
seen for tracks with a somewhat negative local pad coordinate and a positive
bias is seen for tracks with a somewhat positive local pad coordinate. This is a
consequence of the fact that the width of the charge cloud, σ, is underestimated
because of the use of the noise parameter, pnoise, as described in section 6.1. For
smaller values of pnoise, σ increases and the amplitude of the bias oscillation
decreases. The magnitude of the bias oscillation is larger in the simulated
samples. In all cases, the bias is smallest at the edges or the centre of the pad, as
expected, since σ does not inﬂuence the reconstructed transverse coordinate at
those locations. Overall, the eﬀect is small enough that it does not signiﬁcantly
contribute to the overall pad row resolution.

For the wide pads, the resolution is best for tracks that cross near the edge
of the pad. This dependence is expected and described in Appendix A. The
simulation shows the same trend, but shows a much more peaked behaviour at
the centre of the pad. For the narrow pads, the resolution is roughly constant
across the pad for data and in the simulation.

track separation (mm)

Fig. 12. The degradation in transverse resolution is shown as a function of the
transverse separation between two parallel tracks, for P5 gas at 4T. The z values
shown are the drift distances of the tracks. The laser data and simulations (open
symbols with the same shape) show rough agreement. The simulation result for
muons with 2 mm wide pads, indicate good resolving power for separations above
around 3 mm.

6.3 Two track resolution in the pad plane

To study the capability of the detector to extract track coordinate information
for nearby tracks, two parallel laser beams were brought close together at the
same drift distance. This represents the most diﬃcult situation for resolving
two tracks in a TPC. By using the beam blockers, events were recorded with
individual beams, as well as events with both beams present. As described in
section 5.2, the likelihood track ﬁtter was modiﬁed to ﬁt two tracks for this
study. The fractional increase in the standard deviation of the x0 coordinates
when both beams are present is used to quantify the two track separation
power. A simulation of the laser tracks was also performed, where the laser
ionization was assumed to be Poisson distributed. Figure 12 shows the degra-
dation in the resolution as the beams are brought together for the data and
simulation, in wide and narrow pads in P5 gas at 4T. There is rough agreement
with the data and simulation. To estimate the two track resolution capability
for minimum ionizing tracks in the device, a simulated data set of muon pairs
at diﬀerent separations was generated for the wide pads, and the results are
included in Fig. 12. The track ﬁtter fails to converge for 1% (5%) of the muon
pair events for track separations of 3 mm (2 mm). In summary, this study
indicates that for a GEM TPC with 2 mm wide pads, signiﬁcant information
can be extracted from a pad row when two tracks are as near as 3 mm in that
row.

6.4 Track resolution in the drift direction

The focus of this study is on the resolution performance in the pad plane for
which the demands are the greatest and the magnetic ﬁeld has a direct impact.
For completeness, the observed resolutions in the drift direction are reported in
this section. A linear track ﬁt is performed using the vertical coordinates of the
pad rows and the drift time for the cluster observed on the row. The residuals
of the drift time from each pad row with respect to the full track ﬁt are ﬁt
to Gaussians to determine the standard deviations. As before, the geometric
mean of the standard deviations determined when the track ﬁt includes or
excludes the pad row is taken to be the resolution. The resolution is seen to
degrade with drift distance, as expected from the longitudinal diﬀusion. The
data resolution is somewhat poorer than the values found from the simulation,
as shown in table 4. Although the TDR mixture has a lower longitudinal
diﬀusion constant than P5, it has a faster drift velocity, and with the 50 ns
sampling, the resolutions of the two gases are found to be quite similar.

7 Conclusions

The results presented in this paper indicate that a GEM TPC with pad read-
out is a viable candidate for the central tracker for an experiment at the
International Linear Collider. When operated in a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld with
modest size pads, a full size TPC could collect some 200 pad-row measure-
ments each with transverse spatial resolution of approximately 100 µm, which
should be suﬃcient to achieve the transverse momentum resolution goal of

19

10−4 (GeV/c)−1. [4] In addition, the resolution does not de-
σ(1/pt) = 2
grade signiﬁcantly for nearby tracks, provided their separation is more than
about 1.5 times the pad width.

×

The relatively simple simulation package reproduces many of the general fea-
tures seen in the data. It should be useful, therefore, in optimizing the conﬁg-
uration of GEM TPCs for future experiments at the ILC and elsewhere.

A Resolution and Charge Sharing in a GEM TPC

Consider a charge cloud of np electrons arriving at the GEM plane. Due to
diﬀusion in the drift volume, the electrons are distributed in the transverse
direction, x, with standard deviation σd. If the GEMs provide a gain g (with
negligible variance), the defocusing adds a variance σ2
0 to the x distribution,
and if the x coordinate of all of the resulting electrons are measured with no
uncertainty, then the variance of the mean x coordinate is

σ2
¯x =

σ2

.

(A.1)

To achieve the diﬀusion limit, the GEM term (the second term) must be
much smaller than the diﬀusion term. In reality, the GEM term has additional
contributions from the variance in the gain, and the uncertainties in measuring
the x coordinates for each electron.

20

In a GEM-TPC the x coordinate for each electron is not measured, but rather
the charge shared by neighbouring pads is used to deduce the mean x coordi-
nate. The degradation in resolution due to using large pads can be understood
analytically. Consider two neighbouring semi-inﬁnite pads with the boundary
at x = 0. If the electrons are distributed according to the pdf G(x), the ex-
pectation for the fraction of electrons over the positive-x pad is

between the pads, the variance on the estimate ˆµ is σ2
1.6σ2/n or in other
words a factor 1.6 larger than the variance that would result in perfect x
coordinate measurements for each electron. As the mean of the pdf moves
away from the pad boundary, the variance gets larger; for µ = 1σ (2σ) the
factor increases to 2.3 (9.0). To keep the GEM contribution to the resolution
small, the pad width needs to be less than about 3-4 σ, so that µ is less
than 1.5-2 σ. The eﬀects of noise and thresholds may limit the pad sizes even
further.

B Maximum Likelihood Track Fit in the Pad Plane

The maximum likelihood track ﬁt uses a simple model to describe the way
electrons are spread about the readout pads. Due to diﬀusion, the electrons
are assumed to be distributed in a guassian fashion about the projection of the
particle trajectory onto the readout pad plane. The resulting “Line-Gaussian”
density function is a convolution of the “trajectory density function” and a
two dimensional isotropic Gaussian probability density function. The standard
deviation of the Gaussian, σ, is a free parameter in the ﬁt, like the other track
parameters. The ﬁtted value provides an estimate of the diﬀusion for each
event. For simplicity in the analysis, σ is assumed to be constant along the
the length of the track, a good approximation for the data samples described
in this paper.

The implementation of this model assumes that rectangular pads of equal
height are arranged in a parallel fashion into horizontal rows and that tracks

21

cross several rows. The height of the row is assumed to be much smaller than
the radius of curvature, so that the tracks can be considered to be straight
within the vertical extent of the row.

The true trajectory density function (tdf) for a typical track is non-uniform
along its path due to ionization ﬂuctuations. The model, however, assumes
that within a row, the tdf is uniform. The likelihood,
row, of observing the
distribution of charge is calculated for each row, and the product of the like-
lihoods for all the rows deﬁnes the overall likelihood function,
. In this way,
the model implicitly allows the tdf to vary from row to row.

The expected charge collected by a rectangular pad is determined by integrat-

In order to calculate the likelihood of the observed charge distribution in a

single row, an approximate model is used. The model is developed on the basis
that signals in a row result from a relatively small number, n
O(100), of
electrons liberated in the ionization process that are subsequently ampliﬁed
in the GEM structure. As an approximation, the distribution of charge is
assumed to be multinomial with n observations. This approximation is exact
in the limit that the diﬀusion within and after the GEM structure is small
compared to the diﬀusion in the drift region, the ﬂuctuations due to electronics
noise is small compared to that due to primary electron statistics, and that
thresholds are small. This model was initially developed to study data from
tests without magnetic ﬁelds, in which the dominant contribution to diﬀusion
was in the drift volume. For certain gases and operating conditions in strong
magnetic ﬁelds, the situation is reversed, whereby the diﬀusion primarily arises
in the GEM structure. In fact this feature is desirable in order to ensure
that there is good charge sharing across relatively large pads, as described in
section 1. Nevertheless, the model performs very well in either circumstance.

If Ni electrons are collected by pad i for a system with total GEM gain, g, the
equivalent number of the original ionization electrons associated to the pad is
simply deﬁned as

ni = Ni/g .

These values are non-integer, but a direct continuum extension of the multi-
nomial distribution, yields the log likelihood function,

where j runs over all pads in the row containing pad i.

A spurious signal in a pad far from the track can cause problems for the like-
lihood calculation, since the calculated probability for electrons to be present
there can be vanishingly small. To make the track ﬁt robust to spurious sig-
nals, the probability for a primary electron to be associated with a pad is
modiﬁed by adding a small constant, pnoise,

C Study of resolution determination method

The method used in this paper to form the estimated single row resolution
(ESSR) has been tested using simulated samples and laser data.

For simulated samples, the true values of the track parameters are known.
Events were simulated with the ionization following a straight trajectory, and
the resulting pad signals were ﬁt to straight tracks (ﬁxing 1/r = 0). The
resolution is directly determined from the standard deviation of the residuals
of the ﬁt x0 values with respect to the true values. The direct single row
resolution is deﬁned to be √8 times this standard deviation, since 8 rows are
used in the ﬁt. The ESRR is found to agree with the direct result to within
10%. When the same data is ﬁt to curved tracks (allowing 1/r to ﬂoat), the
ESRR is unaﬀected, but the standard deviation of the residuals for the direct
result increases due to the correlation between x0 and 1/r.

Laser data was used in a similar way to check the ESRR. It was found that
the laser system was quite steady; the mean of the x0 from track ﬁts to the
laser data typically drifted by less than 10 µm over a period of 12 hours. In
the data with two laser beams present at large drift separations, however, the
reconstructed x0 values for the two tracks were found to be correlated. This
is interpretted as due to an angular jitter of the laser and a simple model is
used to describe this situation. The measured track parameter x0 for track i
(i = 1 or 2 - the near or far track), is described as an outcome of a random
variable Xi,

Xi = µi + Rℓ + Ri

(C.1)

where Rℓ is a random variable of mean zero describing the jitter of the laser
system and Ri is a random variable of mean zero describing the random nature
of the x0 measurement by the TPC. The covariance,
,
i
isolates the contribution from the laser jitter, and its square root is found to
be about 10 µm, corresponding to an angular jitter of about 5 µrad.

Only data with two laser pulses are used, so that the laser jitter term can
be removed, and the standard deviation of the remainder is multiplied by √8
to form the direct single row resolution. The direct single row resolution is
determined from ﬁts with 1/r = 0, in order that the correlation between x0
and 1/r not inﬂuence the resolution measurement.

used in the ESRR calculation allowed 1/r to ﬂoat, as is done when estimating
the resolution with the cosmic ray data. The ESRR is found to be somewhat
direct.

In summary, the simulation and laser studies show that the method used in
this paper to estimate the single row resolution of a GEM TPC appears to be
correct within a systematic uncertainty of about 10%.

Abstract

We propose a method for in-situ measurement of the length of kilometer
size Fabry-Perot cavities in laser gravitational wave detectors. The method
is based on the vernier, which occurs naturally when the laser incident on
the cavity has a sideband. By changing the length of the cavity over several
wavelengths we obtain a set of carrier resonances alternating with sideband
resonances. From the measurement of the separation between the carrier
and a sideband resonance we determine the length of the cavity. We apply
the technique to the measurement of the length of a Fabry-Perot cavity in
the Caltech 40m Interferometer and discuss the accuracy of the technique.

1 Introduction

Very long Fabry-Perot cavities serve as measuring devices for interferometric
gravitational wave detectors, which are currently under construction [1, 2, 3].
Among them is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO)
which will have 4 km long cavities [2]. The cavity length, deﬁned as the coating-
to-coating distance between its mirrors, is an important parameter for these grav-
itational wave detectors. It determines the detector sensitivity and its overall per-
formance. Therefore, the length must be known with high accuracy, especially
if more than one wavelength of laser is required to resonate in the cavity. Since
the length of LIGO Fabry-Perot cavities can change by 0.4 mm due to ambient
seismic motion of the ground we do not need to measure the length with accuracy
better than a millimeter.

Measurement of distances of order a few kilometers with millimeter accuracy
requires special techniques, such as GPS or optical interferometry. Application
of the GPS technique would be difﬁcult because the mirrors of the gravitational
wave detectors are inside a vacuum envelope and the GPS receivers cannot be
placed very close to the reﬂective surfaces of the mirrors. On the other hand
optical interferometry provides both convenient and precise way to measure dis-
tances [4]. Common techniques are the method of fractional fringe, the method
of synthetic wavelength and the method frequency scanning [5]. Variations of
these techniques for different applications are discussed in the SPIE Publication
[6]. Although these techniques may provide high precision length measurements
(100 µm and better) they are not well suited for Fabry-Perot cavities of the grav-
itational wave detectors. All these techniques require installation of additional
optics, modiﬁcation of the detector conﬁguration and alignment.

In this paper we propose a technique for in-situ measurement of the cavity
length which requires no special equipment or modiﬁcation to the interferome-
ter. The technique is based on the ability of the Fabry-Perot cavity to resolve
close spectral lines. The only requirement is that there be at least two close wave-
lengths in the laser incident on the Fabry-Perot cavity. This requirement will be
easily satisﬁed by all gravitational wave detectors, which are currently under con-
struction, because optical sidebands are an essential part of their signal extraction
schemes.

For single wavelength input laser a Fabry-Perot cavity produces an array of
resonances along its optical axis. The resonances are equally spaced and sep-
arated by the half-wavelength of the laser. By moving one of the mirrors over
several wavelengths, and thus changing the cavity length, we can observe these

1

resonances. Two slightly different wavelengths give rise to two sets of resonances
with slightly different spacings, thereby forming a vernier scale along the optical
axis.

Mechanical verniers have been extensively used in various precision measure-
ment devices, such as calipers and micrometers. The idea of a vernier is that
an enhanced precision is obtained if two slightly different length scales are used
simultaneously [7], [8]. The technique we propose here is an extension of the
vernier idea to the length scales set by the laser wavelengths.

Our method is similar to the method developed by Vaziri and Chen [9] for
application to multimode optical ﬁbres. They obtain the intermodal beat length
of the two-mode optical ﬁbres by measuring a separation between the resonances
corresponding to these modes. We developed our method independently of them
for application to the very long Fabry-Perot cavities in gravitational wave detec-
tors. Although different in motivation and underlying physics our method resem-
bles theirs, because of the common vernier idea.

2 Theory of vernier method

A mechanical vernier is a combination of two length scales which usually differ
by 10%. The optical vernier, described in this paper, is made out of two laser
wavelengths which differ by roughly one part in 108. To use the laser wavelengths
in exactly the same way the mechanical verniers are used would be impossible.
Instead we relate the optical vernier with the beat length, as we describe below.

Let the primary length scale be a and a secondary length scale be a′. Assume
that a′ > a and consider two overlapping rulers made out of these length scales,
which start at the same point. Let z be a coordinate along the rulers with origin at
the starting point. The coordinates for the two sets of marks are

(1)
z = Na,
z′ = N ′a′,
(2)
where N and N ′ are integers. Each mark on the secondary rule is shifted with re-
spect to the corresponding mark on the primary ruler. The shift accumulates as we
move along the z-axis. At some locations along z-axis the shift becomes so large
that the mark on the secondary ruler passes the nearest mark on the primary ruler.
The ﬁrst passage occurs at z = b, where b is the beat length, deﬁned according to
the equation

(3)

a′ .

Other passages occur at multiples of the beat length:

y = mb,

where m is integer. Thus the number of beats within a given length, z′, is equal
to the integer part of the fraction z′/b. The beat number, m, is related to the order
numbers of the two nearest marks on the different rulers:

Periodicity of the beats manifests itself in the similarity relation

Derivation of this identity is given in the Appendix.

Let us deﬁne the shift of the mark at z′ on the secondary ruler with respect to

the nearest mark at z on the primary ruler as a fraction

Then the similarity relation, equation (6), allows us to express the length of the
secondary ruler in terms of the beat length:

m = N − N ′.

z′ = y + µb

= (m + µ)b.

Therefore, if we know the beat number, m, and the shift, µ, we can ﬁnd the length
of the ruler.

We illustrate the method on an example of a vernier with length scales: a = 1
and a′ = 1.12, shown in ﬁgure 1. In this case the beat length is 9 1
3. There are no
passages within the length shown in the ﬁgure, therefore m = 0. From the ﬁgure
we see that the shift is equal to 0.6. Thus we ﬁnd that the length of the secondary
ruler, z′ = µb, is equal to 5.6, which is a correct result as can be seen from the
ﬁgure.

For a single wavelength laser a Fabry-Perot cavity produces an array of res-
onances along its optical axis. Two slightly different wavelengths give rise to
two overlapping arrays of resonances with slightly different spacings and form a
vernier scale.

Let z be a coordinate along the optical axis of the cavity. Assume that the
input mirror is placed at z = 0 and the end mirror is at z = L. In the experiment
below different wavelengths are obtained by phase modulation of a single wave-
length laser. Let the frequency of the phase modulation be f then the modulation
wavelength is Λ = c/f . Three most prominent components of the phase modu-
lated laser are the carrier with wavelength λ0 and the ﬁrst order sidebands with
wavelengths λ±1, which are deﬁned as

Any two wavelengths can be used to form a vernier. For example, the primary
scale can be set by the carrier, a = 1
2 λ0, and the secondary scale can be set by
either of the sidebands: a′ = 1
2 λ±1. Then the coordinates for the carrier and the
sideband resonances are given by the equations (1)-(2). Correspondingly, the beat
length is set by the modulation wavelength:

Thus a vernier occurs in Fabry-Perot cavity when a multiple wavelength laser
beam is incident on it. This vernier can be used to ﬁnd the cavity length. Similar

where “ﬂoor” stands for greatest integer less than. As long as the approximate
length is known with accuracy better than the beat length the beat number is de-
ﬁned exactly. The shift, µ, can be obtained from observation of the carrier and
sideband resonances.

3 Measurement results and discussion

We apply the technique to measure the length of Fabry-Perot cavity of the 40m
prototype of LIGO interferometer at Caltech. For our measurement we use one
of the arm cavities of the interferometer and the Pound-Drever signal extraction
scheme [10]. The setup is shown in ﬁgure 2.

A single wavelength (λ0 = 514.5 nm) laser beam is generated by Ar laser. The
sidebands on the laser are produced by phase modulation at the Pockels cell, which
takes its input from the RF oscillator with modulation frequency of 32.7 MHz.
The modulation wavelength corresponding to this frequency is Λ = 9.16795 m.
The resulting multi-wavelength laser beam is incident on the Fabry-Perot cavity,
whose approximate length, L = 38.5 ± 0.2 meters, is known from previous mea-
surements. From the approximate length we ﬁnd the beat number:

m = 8.

(14)

Both the input and the end mirror of the cavity are suspended from wires and
are free to move along the optical axis of the cavity. The signals are obtained from
the photodiodes PD1 and PD2. The signals are: the cavity transmitted power and
the Pound-Drever signal, which is the output of the mixer. Although either signal
can be used for length measurement we choose the Pound-Drever signal because
it provides higher precision than the signal based on the transmitted power.

In the experiment the motion of the front mirror is damped by a local control
system and the end mirror is swinging freely through several wavelengths. As the

end mirror moves through the resonances sharp peaks appear in the output signals.
From the trace on the oscilloscope, ﬁgure 3, we obtain the times when the mirror
passes through the carrier resonances, t0(p), and the sideband resonances, t±1(p),
where p is integer from 1 to 6. The times are found with a precision of 1 µs, set
by the resolution of the oscilloscope.

The carrier resonances are located at

z0(p) = (p − 1)

+ u,

λ0

where u is an unknown constant, which cancels in the calculation. The location of
the sideband resonances can be found from the times t±1(p) if the trajectory of the
mirror is known. We ﬁnd the approximate trajectory of the mirror by polynomial
interpolation between the carrier resonances. The plot of the interpolated mirror
trajectory is shown in ﬁgure 4. Let the interpolation polynomial be F (t). Using
the polynomial we ﬁnd the location of the sideband resonances as follows

(15)

(16)
(17)

Once the locations of the carrier and the sideband resonances are known we can

z−1(p) = F (t−1(p)) + u,
z+1(p) = F (t+1(p)) + u.

Using the equation (12) we ﬁnd the length of the cavity

The error in the cavity length comes from the error in the beat length and the
error in the shift. In our experiment the dominant was the error in the shift, which
is mostly the error of the polynomial interpolation. The interpolation error can be

greatly reduced if the change in the cavity length is known with high precision.
This can be done, for example, by controlling the cavity mirrors at low frequen-
cies.

The limiting precision of the technique, δL, is determined by the signal used to
obtain the shift µ. For the transmitted power the limit comes from the ﬁnite width
of resonances in the Fabry-Perot cavity. A separation between the resonances in
the transmitted power can be measured up to a width of a resonance. Therefore,

δL ∼ Λ/2
Finesse

,

which is roughly 4 mm for our experiment. This precision limit does not depend
on the length of the cavity.

There is no limit due to the ﬁnite width if the resonances are observed in
the Pound-Drever signal. In this case the separation between the resonances are
found from zero-crossings or peaks in the Pound-Drever signal and the shifts can
be measured with a precision far better than the width of a resonance. For the
Pound-Drever signal the limit on the precision is given by the uncertainty in the
beat length

(22)

(23)

which is deﬁned by stability of the oscillator. In our case 1 Hz-stability of the
oscillator sets the limit of 1 µm to the precision of the technique.

There are two small but noteworthy systematic errors in this method: one is
due to the phase change upon reﬂection off the mirrors, the other is due to the
Guoy phase of the Gauss - Hermite modes of Fabry-Perot cavity [11]. If the phase

of the reﬂected laser is not exactly opposite to the phase of the incident laser at the
mirror surface the resonances in the cavity become shifted. This effect can be as
large as λ/4 per mirror and is far below the precision of the technique. The Guoy
phase also affects the location of the resonances and can be at most π/2 for the
lowest mode of the cavity. Thus the largest contribution due to the Guoy phase is
λ/4 and can also be neglected.

4 Conclusion

The method of optical vernier is a simple and accurate way to measure the cavity
length of the laser gravitational wave detectors in-situ. The method requires no
special equipment or modiﬁcation to the detector. We tested the method on the
40m prototype of the LIGO interferometers and attained a precision of 4 mm. The
ultimate precision of the method is deﬁned by the uncertainty in the beat length,
and is of order a few microns. The method is general and can be used for length
measurement of any Fabry-Perot cavity, which allows for small adjustment of its
length.

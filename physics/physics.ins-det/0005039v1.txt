PHOTON SENSITIVITY OF SUPERHEATED DROP

AT ROOM TEMPERATURE

Abstract

It has been reported so far that superheated drops made of R-12 at room
temperature are sensitive to neutrons yet insensitive to photons. This prop-
erty makes its use as one of the most useful neutron dosimeter. The photon
sensitivity of R-12 at room temperature (25oC) when exposed to 59.54 keV
photons obtained from radioactive 241Am has been noted for the ﬁrst time in
our laboratory. This discovery is important not only from the point of view of
basic science but more important to the users of R-12 in neutron dosimetry to
take note of this in assessing the neutron dose correctly. This discovery also
indicates a new direction of investigation with R-12 detector.

Superheated drops are known to detect energetic radiations[1,2,3]. Among the
various liquids studied, R-12 (dichlorodiﬂuoromethane) is found to be the most widely
used material in neutron dosimetry in view of its capability to detect thermal to fast
neutrons at room temperature yet insensitive to gamma rays. Apfel[4] observed R-12
to be insensitive to gamma rays at room temperature when exposed to strong 60Co
source and assumed its gamma ray sensitivity for photons only above 6 MeV, when
its energy is comparable to the binding energy per nucleon thus producing neutrons,
through photo-nuclear reactions[5]. Ing et.al.[3] also found R-12 to be insensitive to
gamma rays when exposed to a strong radioactive 60Co source.

According to the empirical relationship suggetsed by d’Errico et. al.[6], super-
heated liquid becomes sensitive to photons at a temperature close to the midpoint
between its boiling point and critical temperature. Therefore, according to this rela-
tion, R-12 (b.p. -29.79oC, Tc. 112oC) should exhibit photon sensitivity close to about
41oC. Contrary to all these predictions, the present work demonstrates the sensitiv-
ity of R12 detector to gamma rays at room temperature (25oC), when exposed to
59.54 keV photons obtained from a radioactive 241Am.

In this work, R12 drops have been suspended homogeneously in a viscoelastic
gel as has been reported elsewhere[7]. R-12 sample thus prepared, taken in a 15ml

glass vial was exposed to gamma rays (59.54kev) from 241Am (0.5Ci) at an average
room temperature of 25oC and the nucleation was observed by counting the num-
ber (N) of drops vaporised per minute (t). This was done by detecting the pressure
pulse produced due to each drop vaporisation with the help of a piezo-electric trans-
ducer[8], coupled to a drop counter and multichannel scaler (MCS). The nucleation
rate (dN/dt) has been recorded continuously in MCS. The results presented in ﬁgure
1 shows nucleation rate (dN/dt) with time (t). The nucleation rate at any time is
proportional to the ﬂux of incoming photons and the number of drops present in the
sample at that time. Therefore dN/dt decreases with time as nucleation proceeds.

Nucleations due to background radiations and due to the presence of hetero-
geneous nucleation sites, if any, have been recorded for 65 minutes at the beginning
of the experiment. The radioactive 241Am was then placed very close to the detector
(at a distance of 1.2 cm from the centre of the detector vial) to observe the nucleation
prominently and the nucleation rate was noted. Nucleation due to background was
noted again after removing the radioactive source. As can be seen from Fig. 1, there
is signiﬁcant increase in nucleation above background when the source is placed near
the detector, thus conﬁrming the gamma ray sensitivity of R-12 at room temperature.
However, the eﬃciency of R-12 for detecting such photons at room temperature is
quite small as has been observed experimentally. When the present source was placed
at a distance greater than 2.5cm from the centre of the vial (containing R-12 drops)
there was no nucleation.

In a seperate experiment, the R-12 sample was exposed to 32.5 mCi 137Cs
(662keV) and 0.45 mCi 60Co (average energy of 1225 keV), and no nucleation was
noted. This result conﬁrms the earlier observation of Apfel[5] and Ing et. al.[3].

One may ask why R-12 is sensitive to low energy photons rather than higher
energies at room temperature. The answer lies on the nature of interaction of photons
with matter. Gamma rays are detected by the initiation of vapour bubbles caused
by the energy deposition of electrons produced by photons while passing through the
liquid. Looking at the linear energy transfer (dE/dx) of electrons at these energies
(from tens of keVs to close to 1 MeV), one may ﬁnd that dE/dx is larger at lower
energies than higher electron energies. Therefore the energy deposition in the liquid
is larger for lower energy photons and favourable for nucleation compared to higher
energy photons. As the temperature of the detector sample increases, the degree of
superheat of the liquid increases and it requires lesser and lesser amount of energy for
nucleation of drops. This explanation was found to be true in a seperate experiment,
where the sample was found to be sensitive to higher energy photons (662 keV and
1225 keV) at higher temperatures. Complete investigation on this subject will be
reported elsewhere.

The present discovery of the photon sensitivity of R-12 at room temperature
opened up a new vista of investigation. More importantly this discovery demonstrates
that it is wrong to assume that R-12 is insensitive to photons at room temperature

2

and constitutes a valid warning to the users of R-12 as neutron dosimeter while
assessing the actual neutron dose. Further investigations on the sensitivity of R-12
to lower energy photons are needed.

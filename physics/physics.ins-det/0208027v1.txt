The inﬂuence of initial impurities and irradiation
conditions on defect production and annealing in
silicon for particle detectors

Ionel Lazanu∗ and Sorina Lazanu†

January 15, 2014

Abstract

Silicon detectors in particle physics experiments at the new accelerators or
in space missions for physics goals will be exposed to extreme radiation con-
ditions. The principal obstacles to long-term operation in these environments
are the changes in detector parameters, consequence of the modiﬁcations in
material properties after irradiation.

The phenomenological model developed in the present paper is able to ex-
plain quantitatively, without free parameters, the production of primary de-
fects in silicon after particle irradiation and their evolution toward equilibrium,
for a large range of generation rates of primary defects. Vacancy-interstitial
annihilation, interstitial migration to sinks, divacancy and vacancy-impurity
complex (V P , V O, V2O, CiOi and CiCs) formation are taken into account.
The eﬀects of diﬀerent initial impurity concentrations of phosphorus, oxygen
and carbon, as well as of irradiation conditions are systematically studied.
The correlation between the rate of defect production, the temperature and
the time evolution of defect concentrations is also investigated.

Introduction

The use of silicon detectors in high radiation environments, as to be expected
in future high energy accelerators or in space missions, poses severe problems due
to changes in the properties of the material, and consequently inﬂuences the per-
formances of detectors.

As a consequence of the degradation to radiation of the semiconductor material,
an increase of the reverse current due the reduction of the minority carrier lifetime,
a reduction of the charge collection eﬃciency and a modiﬁcation of the eﬀective
doping, due to the generation of trapping centres, are observed in the detector
characteristics.

In this paper, the eﬀects of irradiation conditions and various initial impurities
in the starting material are discussed in the frame of the phenomenological model
able to explain quantitatively defect production and evolution toward stable defects
during and after irradiation in silicon. The model supposes three steps.

In the ﬁrst step, the incident particle, having kinetic energies with values in the
intermediate up to high energy range, interacts with the semiconductor material.
The peculiarities of the interaction mechanisms are explicitly considered for each
kinetic energy.

In the second step, the recoil nuclei resulting from these interactions lose their
energy in the lattice. Their energy partition between displacements and ionisation
is considered in accord with the Lindhard theory ([1] and authors’ contributions
[2]).

A point defect in a crystal is an entity that causes an interruption in the lat-
tice periodicity. In this paper, the terminology and deﬁnitions in agreement with
M. Lannoo and J. Bourgoin [3] are used in relation to defects. We denote the
displacement defects, vacancies and interstitials, as primary point defects, prior to
any further rearrangement. After this step the concentration of primary defects is
calculated.

The mechanisms of interaction of the incident particle with the semiconductor
lattice, accompanied by displacement defect production have been discussed in some
papers, see, e.g. references [4, 5, 6]. The incident particle produces, as a consequence
of its interaction with ions of the semiconductor lattice, cascades of displacements.
In silicon, vacancies and interstitials are essentially unstable and interact via

migration, recombination, and annihilation or produce other defects.

The concentration of primary defects represents the starting point for the follow-
ing step of the model, the consideration of the annealing processes, treated in the
frame of the chemical rate theory. A review of previous works about the problem of
the annealing of radiation induced defects in silicon can be found, e.g. in Reference
[7].

Without free parameters, the model is able to predict the absolute values of the
concentrations of defects and their time evolution toward stable defects, starting
from the primary incident particle characterised by type and kinetic energy.

The ﬁrst two steps have been treated extensively in previous papers [4, 5, 6],
where the concentration of primary defects has been calculated. In this paper, the
third step is discussed extensively and represents a generalisation of the previous
results published in references [7, 8] including also the carbon contributions to defect
kinetics.

The inﬂuence and the eﬀects of diﬀerent initial impurity concentrations of phos-
phorus, oxygen and carbon as well as of the irradiation conditions were system-
atically studied. Vacancy-interstitial annihilation, interstitial migration to sinks,
vacancy - impurity complexes (V P , V2, V O, V2O, CiOi, CiCs) - only the stable de-
fects conﬁrmed experimentally in silicon for high energy physics applications were
considered. The correlation between the rate of defect productions, the temper-
ature and the time evolution of the defect concentrations was also investigated.
Some conclusions about the possibilities to obtain semiconductor materials harder
to radiation are given.

2 Production of primary defects

The basic assumption of the present model is that the primary defects, vacancies
and interstitials, are produced in equal quantities and are uniformly distributed in
the material bulk. They are produced by the incoming particle, as a consequence
of the subsequent collisions of the primary recoil in the lattice, or thermally (only

2

Frenkel pairs are considered). The generation term G is the sum of two components:

G = GR + GT

(1)

where GR accounts for the generation by irradiation, and GT for thermal generation.
The concentration of the primary radiation induced defects per unit ﬂuence CP D
in silicon has been calculated as the sum of the concentration of defects resulting
from all interaction processes, and all characteristic mechanisms corresponding to
each interaction process, using the explicit formula (see details, e.g.
in references
[9, 10]):

CP D (E) =

L(ERi)SidΩ =

(2)

NSi
2ESi Z Xi

dσ
dΩ (cid:19)i,Si

(cid:18)

NA

NSiASi
2ESi

where E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle, NSi is the atomic density
in silicon, ASi is the silicon atomic number, ESi - the average threshold energy
for displacements in the semiconductor, ERi - the recoil energy of the residual
nucleus produced in interaction i, L(ERi) - the Lindhard factor that describes the
partition of the recoil energy between ionisation and displacements and (dσ/dΩ)i
- the diﬀerential cross section of the interaction between the incident particle and
the nucleus of the lattice for the process or mechanism i, responsible in defect
production. NA is Avogadro’s number. The formula gives also the relation with the
non ionising energy loss (N IEL) the rate of energy loss by displacement (dE/dx)ni
[3, 11].

In Figure 1, the kinetic energy dependence of CP D for diﬀerent particles is
presented:
for pions the values are calculated in accord with equation (1) and
are from reference [12], and for the other particles these are evaluated from the
published N IEL calculations, as follows: for protons - reference [6, 13], for neutrons
- reference [14], for electrons - reference [6, 13] and for photons from [6]. The main
source of errors in the calculated concentration of primary defects comes from the
modelling of the particle - nucleus interaction and from the number and quality of
the experimental data available for these processes.

Due to the important weight of annealing processes, as well as to their very
short time scale, CP D is not a measurable physical quantity. In silicon, vacancies
and interstitials are essentially unstable and interact via migration, recombination,
and annihilation or produce other defects. In the simplifying hypothesis of random
distribution of CP D for all particles, used in the present paper, the identity of
the particle is lost after the primary interaction, and two diﬀerent particles could
produce the same generation rate (GR) for vacancy-interstitial pairs if the following
condition:

GR = [(CP D)part.a (E1)] · Φpart.a(E1) = [(CP D)part.b (E2)] · Φpart.2(E2)

(3)

is fulﬁlled. Here, Φ is the ﬂux of particles (a) and (b) respectively, and E1 and E2
their corresponding kinetic energies.

3 The kinetics of radiation induced defects

Silicon used in high energy physics detectors is n-type high resistivity (4 ÷ 6

KΩ cm) phosphorus doped FZ material.

The eﬀect of oxygen in irradiated silicon has been a subject of intensive studies
in remote past. In the last decade a lot of studies have been performed to investigate
the inﬂuence of diﬀerent impurities, especially oxygen and carbon, as possible ways
to enhance the radiation hardness of silicon for detectors in the future generation

of experiments in high energy physics - see, e.g. references [15, 16]. Some people
consider that these impurities added to the silicon bulk modify the formation of
electrically active defects, thus controlling the macroscopic device parameters. Em-
pirically, it is considered that if the silicon is enriched in oxygen, the capture of
radiation-generated vacancies is favoured by the production of the pseudo-acceptor
complex vacancy-oxygen. Interstitial oxygen acts as a sink for vacancies, thus re-
ducing the probability of formation of the divacancy related complexes, associated
with deeper levels inside the gap.

The concentrations of interstitial oxygen Oi and substitutional carbon Ci in sil-
icon are strongly dependent on the growth technique. In high purity Float Zone
Si, oxygen interstitial concentrations are around 1015 cm−3, while in Czochralski Si
these concentrations can reach values as high as 1018 cm−3. Because Czochralski
silicon is not available in detector grade quality, an oxygenation technique devel-
oped at BNL produces Diﬀusion Oxygenated Float Zone in silicon, obtaining a
Oi concentration of the order 5x1017 cm−3. These materials can be enriched in
substitutional carbon up to 1.8x1016 cm−3.

After the irradiation of silicon, the following stable defects have been identiﬁed
(see References [3, 17]): Sii, V P , V O, V2, V2O, CiOi, Ci, CiCs. The pre-existing
thermal defects and those produced by irradiation, as well as the impurities, are
assumed to be randomly distributed in the solid. An important part of the va-
cancies and interstitials annihilate. The sample contains certain concentrations of
impurities, which can trap interstitials and vacancies respectively, and form stable
defects.

Vacancy-interstitial annihilation, interstitial migration to sinks, divacancy, va-
cancy and interstitial impurity complex formation are considered. The role of phos-

4

phorus, oxygen and carbon is taken into account, and the following stable defects :
V P , V O, V2, V2O, CiOi, Ci, CiCs are considered. Other possible defects as V3O,
V2O2, V3O3 [18], are not included in the present model.

The following picture describes in terms of chemical reactions the mechanisms

of production and evolution of the defects considered in the present paper:

Some considerations about the determination of the reaction constants are given in
references [7, 8].

The reaction constants Ki (i = 1, 3 ÷ 9) have the general form:

Ki = Cν exp (−Ei/kBT )

with ν the vibration frequency of the lattice, Ei the associated activation energy
and C a numerical constant that accounts for the symmetry of the defect in the
lattice.

The reaction constant related to the migration of interstitials to sinks could be

expressed as:

K2 = ανλ2 exp (−E2/kBT )

with α the sink concentration and λ the jump distance.

The system of coupled diﬀerential equations corresponding to the reaction scheme

(4) ÷ (13) cannot be solved analytically and a numerical procedure was used.

The following values of the parameters have been used: E1=E2 = 0.4 eV, E3
= 0.8 eV, E4 = 1.4 eV, E5 = 1.1 eV, E6 = 1.3 eV, E7 = 1.6 eV, E8 = 0.8 eV, E9
= 1.7 eV, ν = 1013 Hz, λ = 1015 cm2, α = 1010 cm−2, in accord with standard
constants characterising the silicon material, see for example the books of Lannoo
and Bourgoin [3] or Damask and Dienes [19].

4 Results, discussion, comparison with experimen-

tal data and predictions

The formation and time evolution of stable defects depends on various factors,
e.g. the concentrations of impurities pre-existent in the sample, the rate of genera-
tion, and the temperature.

In Figures 2 a ÷ f, and 3 a ÷ f the formation and time evolution of the vacancy-
oxygen, vacancy-phosphorus, divacancy, divacancy-oxygen, carbon interstitial - oxy-
gen interstitial and carbon interstitial.- carbon substitutional are modelled in silicon
containing diﬀerent initial concentrations of phosphorus, oxygen and carbon, and
for two very diﬀerent rates of generation.

In Figure 2, the evolution of defect concentrations during high rate irradiation
(GR = 7x108 V I pairs/cm3s) is presented. This corresponds, in the model hypoth-
esis, to order of magnitude of the radiation levels estimated for the forward tracker
region at the future LHC accelerator.

The increase of the initial oxygen concentration in silicon, from 2x1015 O/cm3 to
4x1017 O/cm3, conduces, after ten years of operation in the ﬁeld characterised by a
high and constant generation rate, to the increase of the concentrations of V O and
CiOi centres, and to the decrease of the concentrations of V2, V P and CiCs ones.
With the increase of oxygen concentration, a variation of the V2O generation rate is
observed, so that, from the studied cases, the maximum concentration for this defect
is obtained for 5x1016 O/cm3 initial oxygen. The increase of initial phosphorus is
seen in the increase of concentration of V P centres, while the increase of initial
carbon concentration has important consequences on the concentrations of CiCs
centres.
It is interesting to observe that in almost all cases, an equilibrium in
reached between generation and annealing, and a plateau is obtained in the time
dependence of the concentrations. The slowest is, in this respect, V2O, that has the
highest binding energy.

As underlined above, vacancy-oxygen formation in oxygen enriched silicon is
favoured in respect to the generation of V2, V2O and V P . This is an important
feature that could be used for detector applications, determining the decrease of
the leakage current [8]. At high oxygen concentrations, the concentration of V O
centres attains a plateau during the 10 years period considered.

Figure 3: Same as Figure 2, GR = 200 V I pairs/cm3s.

The other extreme situation corresponds to a generation rate GR = 200 V I
pairs/cm3s, equivalent with a rate of defect production by protons from the cosmic
ray spectra in the orbit near the Earth, at about 400 Km, as will be the position
of the International Space Station. The same concentrations of P , O and C have
been considered as pre-existent in silicon as in Figure 2. For this generation rate,
the increase of the oxygen concentration produces the decrease of the concentration
of all centres, with the exception of the V O concentration, that, at these rates, it
is not inﬂuenced by the oxygen content, and of the CiOi concentration, where an
increase is observed. As could be seen from Figure 3, as a consequence of the small
rate of generation rate of vacancy - interstitial pairs, after ten years of operation the
equilibrium between generation and annealing is not reached, the concentrations of
defects being, with the exception of V P (that has a relatively low binding energy),
slightly increasing functions of time.

All curves, both from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, have been calculated for 20oC temper-
ature. Thermal generation has been taken into account in both cases, although it
is important only for the silicon exposed to low rates of defect production.

The inﬂuence of the generation rate of primary defects on the concentration of
stable defects and on their time evolution has also been investigated. In Figure 4
a ÷ f, the time evolution of the V O, V P , V2, V2O, CiOi and CiCs concentrations
is presented for six decades of generation rates of defects (GR=7x105÷ 7x1010 V I
pairs/cm3s), for silicon containing the following concentrations of impurities: 1014
P/cm3, 1016 O/cm3, and 31015 C/cm3 at 20oC temperature. At small times, the
curves corresponding to diﬀerent generation rates are all parallel and equidistant
in a log-log representation. Starting from the highest generation rates, they start
to increase slower (V2, V P ), attain a plateau V2O, or event start to decrease (V O,
CiOi, CiCs. The maximum attained can be the same, independent on the gener-
ation rate as is the case of V O concentration, or could be generation dependent
CiOi, CiCs.

The temperature is another important factor determining the time evolution of
defects. In Figure 5 a ÷ f and 6 a ÷ f, the eﬀect of the temperature is studied
for the same generation rates of primary defects as in Figures 2 and 3 respectively,
for ﬁve temperatures: 20oC, 10oC, 0oC, -10oC, and -20oC. The concentrations of
pre-existing impurities in silicon are as follows: 1014 P/cm3, 1016 O/cm3, and
3x1015 C/cm3. The decrease of the temperature decreases the generation rate
of stable defects, with the exception of V P , where the highest values correspond
to the lowest temperature. The maximum values of the V O concentration are
temperature independent; the values of the concentration on the plateau decrease
with the decrease of temperature for CiOi and CiCs and increase for V2O.

For silicon exposed to low rates of defect production the same amount of time
(Figure 6), the process of defect production in slowed down. The most unexpected
time dependence is for V2, that has the highest values at the lowest temperature.

In a previous paper [8], we demonstrated in concrete cases the importance of
the sequence of irradiation process, considering that the same total ﬂuence can be
attained in diﬀerent situations: the ideal case of instantaneous irradiation, irradia-
tion in a single pulse followed by relaxation, and respectively continuos irradiation
process. As expected, after instantaneous irradiation the concentrations of defects
are higher in respect with ”gradual” irradiation.

After this analysis, the speciﬁc importance of the irradiation and annealing
history (initial material parameters, type of irradiation particles, energetic source
spectra, ﬂux, irradiation temperature, measurement temperature, temperature and
time between irradiation and measurement) on defect evolution must be to under-
line.

The model predictions have been compared with experimental measurements.
A diﬃculty in this comparison is the insuﬃcient information in published papers

regarding the characterisation of silicon, and on the irradiation parameters and
conditions for most of the data.

It was underlined in the literature [20] that the ratio of V O to V P centres in
electron irradiated silicon is proportional to the ratio between the concentrations of
oxygen and phosphorus in the sample. For electron irradiation, in Ref. [21] a linear
dependence of the V2 versus V O centre concentration has been found experimen-
tally. In the present paper, the ratio of concentrations of V2 to V O centres and V O
to V P ones has been calculated in the frame of the model, for the material with
the characteristics speciﬁed in Ref. [21], and irradiated with 12 MeV electrons, in
the conditions of the above mentioned article. The time dependence of these two
ratios is represented in Figure 7. Annealing is considered both during and after
irradiation. It could be seen that for the ratio of V2 and V O concentrations the
curves corresponding to diﬀerent irradiation ﬂuences are parallel, while the ratio of
V O to V P concentrations is ﬂuence independent, in the interval 2x1013÷ 5.5x1014
cm−2, in good agreement with the experimental evidence. The ratio between V2
and V O concentrations is determined by the generation of primary defects by irra-
diation, while the ratio between V O and V P concentrations is determined by the

concentrations of oxygen and phosphorus in silicon.

Our estimations are also in agreement with the measurements presented in ref-
erence [22], after electron irradiation, where defect concentrations are presented as
a function of the time after irradiation. In Figure 8, both measured and calculated
dependencies of the V O and V P concentrations are given. The irradiation was
performed with 2.5 MeV electrons, up to a ﬂuence of 3x1016 e/cm2. A good agree-
ment can be observed for these concentrations. The dependencies put in evidence
the important role played by the carbon-related defects. The relative values are
imposed by the arbitrary units of experimental data.

Also, a good agreement has been obtained between the absolute values of con-
centrations of V P + V2 and CiCs predicted by the model, and the experimental
results after neutron irradiation at a total ﬂuence of 5.67x1013 cm−2, reported in
reference [23]. The calculated 1.5x1013 cm−3 and 4.1x1012 cm−3 concentrations for
V P + V2 and CiCs respectively, are in accord with the values of 1.1x1013 cm−3
and 3.8x1012 cm−3, measured experimentally. For the V O concentration, a poorer
concordance has been obtained.

5 Summary

A phenomenological model that describes silicon degradation due to irradiation
from the point of view of the kinetics of produced defects toward equilibrium was
developed.

The production of primary defects (vacancies and interstitials) in the silicon
bulk was considered in the frame of the Lindhard theory, and the peculiarities of
the particle - silicon nuclei interaction were taken into account.

The mechanisms of formation of stable defects and their evolution toward equi-
librium was modelled, and the concentrations of defects were calculated solving nu-
merically the system of coupled diﬀerential equations for these processes. Vacancy-
interstitial annihilation, interstitial migration to sinks, vacancy-impurities com-
plexes (V P , V O, V2O, CiOi, CiCs), and divacancy formation were considered in
diﬀerent irradiation conditions, for diﬀerent concentrations of impurities in the ini-
tial semiconductor, in the temperature range −20 ÷ +20oC.

The calculated results suggest the importance of the conditions of irradiation,

temperature and annealing history.

The model supports the experimental studies performed to investigate the inﬂu-
ence of oxygen in the enhancement of the radiation hardness of silicon for detectors.
The V O defects in oxygen enriched silicon are favoured in respect to the other stable
defects, so, for detector applications it is expected that the leakage current decreases
after irradiation. At high oxygen concentrations, this defect saturates starting from
low ﬂuences at high generation rates of defects.

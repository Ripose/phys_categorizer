The basic equations governing propagation of electromagnetic and grav-
itational waves in vacuum are nonlinear. As a consequence photon-photon
interaction as well as photon-graviton interaction can take place without a
medium. However, resonant interaction between less than four waves can-
not occur in vacuum, unless the interaction takes place in a bounded region,
such as a cavity or a waveguide. Recent results concerning resonant wave
interaction in bounded vacuum regions are reviewed and extended.

I. INTRODUCTION

Most examples of nonlinear wave phenomena occur as a result of some nonlinear property
of a medium. In particular this applies to electromagnetism since Maxwell’s equations are
linear. Still, nonlinear interaction between photons in vacuum may occur as a result of scat-
tering processes involving vacuum ﬂuctuations, as described by quantum electrodynamics
(QED). An eﬀective theory for this can be formulated in terms of the Euler-Heisenberg La-
grangian [1,2]. It should be noted, however, that resonant interaction between less than four
waves requires that the waves are parallel, in which case the nonlinear QED coupling van-
ishes [3,4]. Similarly, gravitons and photons couple in vacuum, as described by the Einstein-
Maxwell system of equations. But the dispersion relation implies that the waves must be
parallel, in case three wave interaction should be resonant. Just as for photon-photon inter-
action in vacuum, however, this condition means that the wave-coupling vanishes [5]. On
the other hand, the situation is changed if some or all of the interacting waves are conﬁned in
bounded regions such as waveguides or cavities [5–7]. Below we will review and extend recent
results concerning resonant photon-photon scattering as well as photon-graviton scattering
in bounded regions.

II. PHOTON-PHOTON SCATTERING

According to QED, the non-classical phenomenon of photon–photon scattering can take
place due to the exchange of virtual electron–positron pairs. This give rise to vacuum
polarization and magnetization currents, and an eﬀective ﬁeld theory can be formulated in

B, e is the electron charge,
where ξ
c the velocity of light, 2π¯h the Planck constant and me the electron mass. The latter
terms in (1) represent the eﬀects of vacuum polarization and magnetization. We note that
F = G = 0 in the limit of parallel propagating waves.
It is therefore necessary to use
other wave geometries in order to obtain an eﬀect from the QED corrections. Note that this
null-result should be expected on physical grounds, since successive Lorentz boosts along the
direction of propagation would decrease the amplitude of all waves without limit. However,
as shown in Refs. [3,4], a resonant nonlinear interaction between three waves is possible in
bounded regions, as will be considered below.

·

The most common approach [se e.g. Refs. [8]- [13]] to calculate the interaction strength
LEHd3rdt = 0 to ﬁnd
is to use the general Lagrangian, apply the variational principle δ
the inﬂuence of the QED terms in Maxwells equations (where the Lagrangian should be
expressed in terms of the 4-potential), and proceed from there using standard techniques for
weakly nonlinear waves. However, as shown in Ref. [4], the algebra is signiﬁcantly reduced if
one make an ansatz for the potentials corresponding to the ﬁeld geometry of consideration,
and then derive the evolution equations directly from the variational principle, without using
Maxwells equations as an intermediate step.

R

Following the later approach we start by considering three interacting waves in a cavity
with the shape of a rectangular prism. We let one of the corners lie in the origin, and we
let the opposite corner have coordinates (x0, y0, z0). In practice we are interested in a shape
where z0
x0, y0 but this assumption will not be used in the calculations. We let the large
amplitude pump modes have vector potentials of the form

in order for the QED corrections terms to survive the z-integration. The three diﬀerent sign
alternatives in (9) correspond to the mode number matching options (10)-(12) respectively.
Given experimental data for possible values of the pump ﬁeld strengths and the damping
coeﬃcient inside cavities, the saturation level of the excited mode can be determined from
Eq. (8). The possibilities for detection of photon-photon scattering using currently available
performance on microwave cavities will be discussed in the ﬁnal section of the paper.

III. GRAVITATIONAL INTERACTION

transverse and traceless (TT) gauge. Then we have the following line-element

and similarly for the electric ﬁeld.

In an isotropic dielectric medium with permittivity ε diﬀerent from the vacuum perme-
ability, the equation (14) still holds, simply if we replace c by c/n = c/√εr in the above
expressions, where ε = εrε0. For the moment, we will neglect mechanical eﬀects, i.e., eﬀects
which are associated with the varying coordinate distance of the cavity walls due to the
gravitational wave.

Cavity design. The coupling of two electromagnetic modes and a gravitational wave in a
cavity will depend strongly on the geometry of the electromagnetic eigenfunctions. It turns
out that we can greatly magnify the coupling, as compared to a rectangular prism geometry,
by varying the cross-section of the cavity, or by ﬁlling the cavity partially with a dielectric
medium. The former case is of more interest from a practical point of view, since a vacuum
cavity implies better detector performance, but we will here consider the later case since it
can be handled analytically.

Speciﬁcally, we choose a rectangular cross-section (side lengths x0 and y0), and we divide
the length of the cavity into three regions. Region 1 has length l1 (occupying the region
l1 < z < 0) and a refractive index n1. Region 2 has length l2 (occupying the region
−
0 < z < l2), with a refractive index n2, while region 3 consists of vacuum and has length l3
(occupying the region l2 < z < l3 + l2). We will also use l = l1 + l2 + l3 for the total length.
The cavity is supposed to have positive coordinates, with one of the corners coinciding with
the origin. Furthermore, we require that l2
l1, and that the wave number in region 2 is
≪
less than in region 1. The reason for this arrangement is twofold. Firstly, we want to obtain
a large coupling between the wave modes, and secondly we want an eﬃcient ﬁltering of the
eigenmode with the lower frequency in region three.

4

The ﬁrst step is to analyze the linear eigenmodes in this system. Those with the lowest

frequencies are modes of the type

in regions j = 1, 2 and 3, respectively, where the wave in region 3 is a standing wave.
Furthermore, in region 3 we may also have a decaying wave

Using standard boundary conditions, it is straightforward to perform most of the eigenmode
calculations analytically. Once the wavenumbers are calculated for an eigenmode, the re-
lation between the amplitudes in the three regions is found, and thereby the mode proﬁle.
We are speciﬁcally interested in the shift from decaying to oscillatory behavior in region 3,
and we denote the highest frequency which is decaying in region 3 with index a, and the
wave number and decay coeﬃcient with k1a, k2a and k3a respectively. Similarly, the next
frequency, which is oscillatory in both regions, is denoted by index b. If we have l
x0
(and m the same) these two frequencies will be very close, and a gravitational wave which
has a frequency equal to the diﬀerence between the electromagnetic modes causes a small
coupling between these modes. An example of two such eigenmodes is shown in ﬁg. 1.

and we have added a phenomenological linear damping term represented by γ. Thus we note
that for the given geometry, only the h+-polarization gives a mode-coupling. (Rotating the
cavity π/4 around the x-axis will instead give coupling to the h×-polarization.) Furthermore,
if we consider propagation in a diﬀerent angle to the cavity , the result will be slightly
modiﬁed. Calculations of the eigen-mode parameters show that Ic may be diﬀerent from
zero when n1,2
= 1, and generally Ic of the order of unity can be obtained, see ﬁg. 1 for
an example. From Eq. (18), we ﬁnd that the saturated value of the gravitationally excited

In ﬁg. 1 it is shown that we can get an appreciable mode-coupling constant Ic for a cavity
ﬁlled with materials with diﬀerent dielectric constants, and it is of much interest whether the
same can be achieved in a pure vacuum cavity. As seen by Eq. (19), the coupling is essentially
n2ω2/c2)1/2. Thus
determined by the wave numbers of the modes, given by k = (m2π2/x2
by adjusting the width x0 in a vacuum cavity, we may get the same variations in the wave
numbers as when varying the index of refraction n. The translation of our results to a
vacuum cavity with a varying width is not completely accurate, however. Firstly, when
varying x0, the mode-dependence on x and z does not exactly factorize, in particular close
to the change in width. Secondly, the contribution to the coupling Ic in each section becomes
proportional to the corresponding volume, and thereby also to the cross-section. However,
since most of the contribution to the integral in Eq. (19) comes from region 1, our results
can still be approximately translated to the case of a vacuum cavity, by varying x0 instead
of n such as to get the same wavenumber as in our above example. Thus we conclude that

our discussion of the sensitivity of a cavity based detector given below, can be based on a
vacuum cavity rather than a ”dielectric cavity”, where the former case is preferred due to
the much smaller dissipation level.

IV. DISCUSSION OF THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY

∼

For both cases considered above, as can be seen from equations (8) and (20) respectively,
the quality factor Q of the cavity (i.e. the damping time/periodtime) and the allowed ﬁeld
strength are the main parameters that determine the saturation level of the excited mode.
For superconducting niobium cavities large surface ﬁeld strengths (E
60 MV/m) and high
1010 can be obtained simultaneously [14]. For the case of photon-photon
quality factors Q
scattering this typically corresponds to a few excited microwave photons in the new mode.
kT /¯hω3) a few
Provided the number of excited photons beats the thermal noise level (Nth ∼
microwave photons is enough for detection, see e.g. [15] . However, detection of such a small
signal can only take place if the pump waves are ﬁltered out. This can be done directly in
the cavity using a ”ﬁltering geometry”, i.e. a cavity with a variable cross-section, where only
the excited mode has a frequency above cut-oﬀ in the detection region of the cavity. Our
conclusion is that detection of photon-photon scattering is possible in a microwave cavity
using current technology, provided the equipment has state of the art performance, and a
ﬁltering geometry is applied.

∼

The considerations for the gravitational wave detector are similar to the photon-photon
scattering case. However, we must also take the length variations of the detector due to
acoustic thermal noise into account. As a consequence, an eﬃcient detector must then have
106(where Qmec describes the relative
a rather high mechanical quality factor Qmec
damping of acoustic oscillations), for sensitive detection to be possible. Furthermore, we
must also be aware that the gravitational wave sources of most interest - binary systems
close to collapse - produces radiation with a ﬁnite frequency chirp, implying a ﬁnite time
of coherent interaction, typically fractions of a second. If the above aspects are taken into
account, we ﬁnd that a cavity based detector of a few meters length can detect metric
10−23(See Ref. [5] for a more thorough discussion of
perturbations of the order hmin
the detection level.).

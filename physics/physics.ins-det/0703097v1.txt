Using a test TPC, consisting of the ALICE TPC ﬁeld cage prototype in combination
with the ﬁnal ALICE TPC readout and electronics, the energy loss distribution and
resolution were measured for identiﬁed protons. The measurements were compared to
theoretical calculations and good quantitative agreement was found when detector eﬀects
were taken into account. The implications for particle identiﬁcation are discussed.

1. Introduction

The ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the main tracking detector in the
central region of the ALICE heavy ion experiment at LHC 1. In addition to excellent
tracking capabilities, the TPC has particle identiﬁcation (PID) capabilities through
the measurement of the ionization. This is especially interesting in the region of the
relativistic rise, βγ > 3 (pT > 3 GeV/c), where other ALICE detectors have little or
no PID capabilities for pions, kaons, and protons. STAR has successfully used TPC
PID on the relativistic rise to measure important features of heavy ion collisions in
2.
the regime of intermediate and high pT

For PID with TPCs a major limitation is the calibration. So far much of the
PID analysis has used phenomenological descriptions of the data, based on earlier
experience rather than theoretical calculations. In this paper we compare results
from a beam test with a theoretical model of the gas energy loss and comment on
the advantage of such a study.

2. Model Description
In the model of Hans Bichsel 3, the calculation of the energy loss is based on the
Fermi Virtual Photon concept, implemented by Allison and Cobb and elaborated
by Bichsel. The straggling function (Landau distribution), f , for the energy loss,
∆, can then be determined for all track segments, x, and βγ (f (∆) = f (∆, βγ, x)).
In general one has the bookkeeping problem that straggling functions are not
analytical functions and for diﬀerent βγ and x they are not related by a simple

one parameter scaling. However, it was shown in the paper ( 3, Section 8) that two
scaling parameters, a(βγ) and b(βγ), can be found so that:
f (∆, βγ, x) ≈ g(a(βγ) · ∆ + b(βγ, x)).
In that way all straggling functions (and associated truncated mean distributions)
can be approximated by one straggling function (here denoted g for generic) and a
table of two parameter scaling variablesa.

The ionization measured on the TPC pads is related to the energy lost by
the charged particle as it traverses the gas, but there are in principle six steps –
energy loss, energy deposition, ionization, electron transport, ampliﬁcation, and AD
conversion (see 3 p. 159) – which should be considered in going from energy loss
of particles to the ADC output measured in the TPC. So one might ask to what
extend the conclusions for the gas energy loss are also true for the experimental
data:

(i) Does the energy loss spectra calculated in the model describe the measured

charge spectra?

(ii) Can all relevant quantities for PID (such as the truncated mean distribution)

be derived from the straggling function?

(iii) Is two parameter scaling applicable for experimental distributions?

3. Experimental Results
The results presented here were obtained with a test setup described in 4, where
details of the analysis, and more results on electronics performance and spatial
resolution, can also be found.

The data were collected with an ALICE Inner Read-Out Chamber (IROC) which
has 63 pad rows with pad length of 7.5 mm each, resulting in a total track length of
472.5 mm (for the ALICE TPC there is also an Outer Read-Out Chamber (OROC)).
The test TPC was operated with the newly proposed gas mixture Ne-CO2-N2 (85.7-
9.5-4.8) 5.

The tracks originated from a secondary beam of single particles from the CERN
PS where the momentum, p, of the beam was adjustable between 1 and 7 GeV/c
with a resolution σp/p ∼ 0.01. The PID was obtained by a TOF setup that allowed
the complete separation of pions and protons up to p = 3 GeV/c. For each pad row
a cluster was reconstructed and the cluster charge, Q, was determined as the sum
of the signals in the cluster.

From the tracks the cluster charge straggling function, f (Q), was measured, and
the “truncated mean” distribution, C, was derived track by track from the average
of the 60% lowest cluster charges.

aIgnoring the high energy tail of the straggling function one could possibly to a high degree of
precision (see Figure 9 and 10 in 3) use only one relevant parameter, the number of primary
collisions N p = dN p/dx(βγ) · ∆x.

Fig. 1. The straggling data (left) and the truncated mean distribution (right) for protons with
momentum 1 and 3 GeV/c. Left: The dashed line indicates the most probable value, ∆p, of the
straggling functions while the double arrows denote the full width at half maximum FWHM, w.
Right: The solid line is a normalized Gaussian ﬁt to the distribution.

In the following we study protons with p = 1 GeV/c (294 tracks), and p =
3 GeV/c (614 tracks). This is a small subset of the beam test data with clean PID.
The straggling data and the truncated mean distributions are shown in Figure 1.
The probability of a true Gaussian ﬁt to the two truncated mean distributions
corresponding to p = 1 and 3 GeV/c was found to be only 15 %, and 0.04 %,
respectively, indicating that the truncated mean is not strictly Gaussian distributed,
with a shoulder at higher C clearly visible, especially in the 1 GeV/c data.

The energy loss resolution was found to be in agreement with that determined
in the ALICE TPC Technical Design Report 1, when one takes into account that
the track length in the full ALICE TPC is 3.3 times longer (IROC+OROC) than
in the prototype (IROC).

4. Comparison with Model Calculations

In this section we use the measurements shown in Figure 1 and model calculations
supplied by Hans Bichsel to study the questions outlined in section 2.

Figure 2 shows an overlap of the measured straggling data for 1 GeV/c protons
and the scaled measured straggling data for 3 GeV/c protons (left), and similarly
the overlap of the two truncated mean distributions (right). The scaling param-
eters were determined from the data. The close agreement demonstrates the ap-

Note that the same set of scaling variables is used for both comparisons.

plicability of two-parameter scaling between Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIPs)
(p = 3 GeV/c protons) and particles with an energy loss similar to that on the
plateau (p = 1 GeV/c protons has similar energy loss spectra as 1000 GeV/c pro-
tons (except for the large ∆ tail)). Since the scaling works for the smallest length
scale (the pads in the OROCs are longer: 10 mm and 15 mm) and for the relevant
energy loss range for high-pt PID, this scaling is probably applicable to all relevant
distributions.

Figure 3 shows a comparison between the experimental cluster charge data and
energy loss calculations for 3 GeV/c protons. The conversion factor (ADC ch/eV)
is the only free parameter and has been adjusted to align the peaks; the overall
normalization is ﬁxed by requiring the integral to be unity. The agreement between
the two straggling functions is reasonable, but the extracted resolution from the
truncated mean is σC = 8.0 % in the model and 9.3% for the data (Figure 1),

leaving a discrepancy of 15 %.

This diﬀerence is also found when comparing the experimental straggling data
to the experimental truncated mean distribution. If cluster charges are randomly
generated with probabilities according to the experimental straggling data (shown
in Figure 1) and a virtual track is constructed with the same number of clusters as
for the data, the resolution is close to the 8 %, in agreement with the model, but
not with the experimental results. The resolution of the real tracks is deteriorated
because cluster charges are correlated; when cluster charges in neighboring pad rows
are compared they exhibit a +33% correlation factor, which reduces the generic
information for the track.

Fig. 4. Comparison of the measured straggling data and truncated mean distributions (experi-
mental data) to the model of Bichsel with detector eﬀects included (simulation).

The correlations in the cluster data originate from detector eﬀects during the six
steps from energy loss to ADC output mentioned in section 2. Figure 4 shows the
comparison between the data and the adjusted Bichsel model modiﬁed for diﬀusion
(electron transport) and exponential gain ampliﬁcation variations (ampliﬁcation),
see 4 for details. From the agreement we conclude that the energy loss mechanism
and the two detector eﬀects combined are suﬃcient to describe the data.

This method also ﬁxes the adjustment of the gain to G = 9.6 ADC ch/electron
or an eﬀective gas ampliﬁcation gain of 9 600 (the fraction of the signal picked up
by the pads).

If the simulated distributions are treated as ﬁts to the truncated mean distri-
butions, the probability of the model describing the data is 21 %, and 0.11 %, for
the p = 1 and 3 GeV/c data sets respectively. In both cases, the description of
the data is better than the previous Gaussian ﬁt functions in Figure 1 where, for
each setting, there are two ﬁt parameters to adjust. For the energy loss model the
two gas gains diﬀer by less than 3 % which could be due to gas density variations
between the two runs.

5. Conclusion

We have found that it is possible to describe the test data with calculations from
ﬁrst principles when detector eﬀects are taken into account. This good agreement
between model and data led Hans Bichsel to propose an optimization of the ALICE
Monte Carlo simulation 6.

The tracks are not fully characterized by their straggling functions since the
cluster charges in a track are correlated. So it is not possible to directly use energy
loss calculations to optimize PID. Note also that a ﬁt to the cluster charges of a
single track to extract e.g. the most probable energy loss as a PID estimator will
face the same problems since the data are correlated, so that the ﬁtting assumption
of independent data is not fulﬁlled.

It is interesting to note that the two parameter scaling relation is still true for
the experimental data. This might only be true in the case, as here, where one has
almost identical track geometry, so that eﬀects of diﬀusion are the same.

Even though the disagreement between the resolution derived from the experi-
mental straggling data and the one measured from the truncated mean could have
been found in the data, it was only realized after comparing to the model calcu-
lations, so we would like to stress that a quantitative precise model of the energy
loss in gases is an important tool for calibrating and understanding a TPC (and
any other gas detector).

6. Acknowledgments

The authors would like to thank Hans Bichsel for many valuable discussions on
energy loss in gases, PID, and for supplying us with model calculations.

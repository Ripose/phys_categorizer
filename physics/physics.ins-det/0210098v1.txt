our Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM), the sample is mounted at the end of a thin
cantilever with small thermal conductance. Thus, the sample can be at a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent

magnetism in solid air provides the temperature of the sample, without any modiﬁcations to our

and

In many Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy
(MRFM)1,2,3,4,5,6
cantilever magnetometry
experiments,7 the sample being measured is mounted
at the end of a thin cantilever. The cantilever often
has very poor thermal conductance because of its small
cross section in comparison to its length. Even a small
heat input into the sample can raise its temperature
signiﬁcantly from the temperature at the opposite end
(base) of the cantilever. Obviously, the temperature of
the sample can be critical to the results of an experiment
because of many temperature dependent factors like
spin polarization or time constants.2,3 Mounting a
temperature sensor at the end of the cantilever would
be diﬃcult, requiring a sensor of ≤10 µm dimensions
integrated with the cantilever. An indirect way to
measure the temperature of a cantilever is to measure
(Brownian) motion of the cantilever.8
the thermal
Using simple Brownian motion requires that the spring
constant of the loaded cantilever is known and that the
temperature is uniform along the cantilever and equal
to the sample temperature. In addition, the Brownian
motion method relies on the absence of non-thermal
sources of cantilever motion for correct temperature
measurement. Sources of sample heating (such as RF
magnetic ﬁelds and optical power) can also be sources of
non-thermal motion.

A simple alternative is to use cantilever magnetometry
to measure the paramagnetism of oxygen in frozen air on
the sample. This technique does not require any mod-
iﬁcation of the experimental probe used for MRFM or
cantilever magnetometry, and provides a relative mea-
sure of the sample temperature up to the sublimation
temperature of the solid air.
In essence, the tempera-
ture is measured by using the temperature dependence
of the magnetic susceptibility of the air “contamination”
of the sample surface. The paramagnetic electron spins of
the oxygen molecules in the solid air have a large, easily
measureable temperature dependence of magnetic sus-
ceptibility. This technique could also be done just using
the susceptibility of the sample itself if there is enough

temperature dependence of the susceptibility.

The experimental setup is the same as used for our
sample on cantilever MRFM experiments.1 The sample
for MRFM (in this case GaAs) is mounted with ther-
mally conductive silver epoxy on a gold-coated SiNx can-
tilever with spring constant, k∼0.05 N/m. The SiNx can-
tilever has very poor thermal conductance because of the
low thermal conductivity of SiNx and thin cross section
(the cantilever is 0.6 µm thick, 22 µm wide, and 320 µm
long).9 In order to increase the thermal conductivity of
the cantilever, it was coated on each side with either 300
˚A/700 ˚A or 300 ˚A/1700 ˚A of Ti/Au. Coating on both
sides is required to reduce bending of the cantilever from
the diﬀerential contraction of the gold and SiNx on cool-
ing. The position of the cantilever is measured with an
optical interferometer.3 Below the sample is the source
of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient, a 250 µm diameter iron
cylinder. The magnetic ﬁeld gradient (δBz/δz = 6000 to
9000 T/m) applies a static force,

Fz = µz

to the net magnetic moment of the oxygen electrons, µ,
which we measure by the deﬂection of the cantilever.
Raw data from the interferometer is shown in ﬁgure 1.
As the magnetic ﬁeld is increased, the oxygen electrons
become more polarized and the force between the oxygen
and the magnetic ﬁeld gradient becomes larger. The can-
tilever deﬂects towards the iron magnet. Raising the tem-
perature decreases the susceptibility and thus the amount
of deﬂection (ﬁgure 1(c)).

This technique of temperature measurement could be
done with the sample itself, if the sample has suﬃcient
temperature dependence of its magnetic susceptibility
for easy measurement. However, “contamination” of the
sample and cantilever surface with solid air can be used
with an arbitrary sample. In addition, air is a resource
available in almost every lab. Coating the sample with a
small amount of frozen air can easily be done by not fully
pumping out the probe before cool down. Because of the

sensitivity of the cantilever, very little air is required.
Just 1011 oxygen molecules (∼monolayer) will result in
several interferometer fringes of deﬂection (hundreds of
nm) during a magnetic ﬁeld sweep to 9 T. Deliberately al-
lowing air into the vacuum system with a non-regulating
valve typically resulted in too much air contamination
and the magnetic force would stick the cantilever to the
iron magnet.

This provides a cautionary warning for cantilever mag-
netometry or MRFM experiments. Oxygen contami-
nation must be avoided for sensitive magnetometry or
MRFM experiments because of the large magnetic sus-
ceptibility of oxygen. For this reason, the temperature
measurements were done ﬁrst and then the air contami-
nation removed before the MRFM experiments. The air
contamination could be removed by heating the probe
head to about 20 K while pumping. The best technique
for avoiding air contamination was to use the heater to
keep the probe head warm, while the rest of the probe
was cooled down.

We should also note that solid air is a better choice for
large and simple temperature dependence of the mag-
netic susceptibility than pure oxygen. Pure solid oxygen
has antiferromagnetic interactions between the molecules
and undergoes two phase transitions in the solid state at
low temperatures (43.8 and 23.9 K).10,11 By contrast,
the oxygen electrons in solid air have been studied re-
cently with EPR at 5 K and shown to behave as S = 1

where g = 2.0 and the zero ﬁeld splitting D = 5.1 K.
The Hamiltonian is written for the case where the axis of
the oxygen molecule is along the magnetic ﬁeld. In the
frozen air, the oxygen molecules have a distribution of
their molecular axes with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld.10
Apparently, the oxygen molecules are dispersed enough
among the nitrogen molecules in the solid air to prevent
antiferromagnetic ordering. Similarly, dilute adsorbed
oxygen results in roughly Curie-Weiss law behavior of
the susceptibility, 1/(T − θ), with θ small and negative.11
Figure 2 shows the deﬂection of the cantilever up to high
ﬁeld. The saturation of the susceptibility at high ﬁeld
is consistent with spin 1 and g ≈ 2 electronic moments.
To provide a calibration for this temperature measure-
ment method, we heated the probe head, which results
in a nearly uniform temperature of the probe head, can-
tilever, and sample. The probe head itself has its tem-
perature measured with a resistive sensor.12 As shown
in ﬁgure 3, the temperature dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility does indeed roughly follow a Curie-Weiss
law with the ﬁtted θ = −2 K.

Then, we applied this technique to measure the sample
temperature under conditions when it is diﬀerent from
the temperature of the rest of the probe head. The mag-
netic susceptibility of the sample with air “contamina-
tion” is measured by the deﬂection of the cantilever by
a change in magnetic ﬁeld. The temperature is derived
by comparison with the calibration done by heating the
entire probe head. The calibration step could be avoided
by assuming the Curie-Weiss law temperature depen-
dence of the oxygen susceptibility and the dominance of
the oxygen susceptibility over any other magnetic sus-
ceptibility of the sample or cantilever. In these MRFM
experiments,1 the GaAs sample can be heated from two
major sources. First, we are applying RF magnetic ﬁeld
which can heat the sample and gold-coated cantilever di-
rectly by eddy current heating and indirectly through
gas conduction. Second, and more signiﬁcantly, we are

the cantilever over a magnetic ﬁeld sweep (0.15, 0.8, or 2 T)

highest temperature (◦ 14.5 K), oxygen desorbs when under
low pressure and the magnetometry is no longer reversible
with temperature. The line is a Curie-Weiss law ﬁt to the

shining light on the sample for optical pumping.13 An-
other smaller heat source is the optical power used in
the interferometer measurement. We measured the sus-
ceptibility and found, for instance, that roughly 4 Gauss
of RF (51.5 MHz) magnetic ﬁeld raised the sample tem-
perature about 1 K. Even more dramatic is the eﬀect of
optical pumping (Fig. 4). The ∼80 µW of optical power
on the GaAs sample at the end of the cantilever can heat
it by 3 K, while the main bulk of the probe has warmed
by less than 0.1 K. This local heating is consistent with
the estimated thermal conductance of the cantilever, ≈25
µW/K, which is dominated by the 700 ˚A gold coating.

We have presented a technique for measuring the tem-
perature of a sample at the end of a cantilever. In general,
oxygen contamination must be avoided for cantilever
magnetometry and MRFM experiments. But here, by
measuring the susceptibility of the oxygen in solid air
contamination, we can determine the temperature with-
out any contact to the sample. This technique can be
extended by using the susceptibility of some other “con-
taminant” or just the sample itself.
In addition, these
measurements are done without any modiﬁcation of the
apparatus which we use primarily for MRFM measure-
ment of the nuclear polarization of the sample.

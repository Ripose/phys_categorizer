Abstract

The ATLAS pixel detector consists of 1744 identical silicon pixel modules arranged in three barrel layers providing
coverage for the central region, and three disk layers on either side of the primary interaction point providing
coverage of the forward regions.

Once deployed into the experiment, the detector will employ optical data transfer, with the requisite powering
being provided by a complex system of commercial and custom-made power supplies. However, during normal
performance and production tests in the laboratory, only single modules are operated and electrical readout is
used. In addition, standard laboratory power supplies are used.

In contrast to these normal tests, the data discussed here was obtained from a multi-module assembly which
was powered and read out using production items: the optical data path, the ﬁnal design power supply system
using close to ﬁnal services, and the Detector Control System (DCS).

To demonstrate the functionality of the pixel detector system a stepwise transition was made from the normal
laboratory readout and power supply systems to the ones foreseen for the experiment, with validation of the data
obtained at each transition.

1. The Atlas Pixel Detector

The pixel detector of the ATLAS experiment is
the innermost part of the inner detector, and will
provide crucial information for precise vertex de-
termination. It will consist of 6 disks, 3 on each
side of the interaction region, and 3 barrel lay-
ers. The disks are comprised of 8 sectors, each of
which is equipped with 6 detector modules. The
3 barrel layers are composed of bi-staves (each
one equipped with 26 detector modules). The layer

closest to the beam pipe (referred to as the B-
Layer) will have 11 bi-staves, while the intermedi-
ate layer (Layer 1) and the outer layer (Layer 2)
will have 19 and 26 of these bi-staves, respectivley.
A bi-stave is divided into 4 half-staves, each with
6 or 7 detector modules.

In total the pixel detector will have 1744 detector
modules possessing 46080 pixel cells each, resulting
in a total number of just over 80 million readout
channels.

Each detector module (Figure 1) consists of 16

frontend chips which are connected to the associ-
ated sensor cells. The readout and control of the
frontend chips is provided by the Module Con-
troller Chip (MCC). The analog part of the front-
end chips is separately supplied, while their digital
part is supplied together with the MCC.

During operation of a detector module, it is also
necessary to provide a depletion supply channel for
the sensor. In addition, the detector module will
have a thermistor (NTC 1 ) which is used to provide
temperature information for each detector module.
This thermistor, with a related interlock circuit [1],
is used to prevent damage to the hardware due to
high temperatures.

3. The Embedded Local Monitor Board

The ELMB 5 , developed by the ATLAS DCS
group, is a multi purpose, low cost I/O device to
monitor and control various hardware components
[2]. Each ELMB provides up to 64 multiplexed
ADC channels and 24 digital I/O-lines. Its CAN 6
bus interface and an OPC 7 server provided by the
ATLS DCS group allow the integration into the
higher level DCS software.

One group of required channels in the pixel DCS
accounts for the large number of temperature sen-
sors that are used throughout the detector volume.
The majority of those is formed by the detector
module thermistors. Additionally the monitoring
of the environment and of other temperature sen-
sitive components needs more ADC channels. All
devices are equipped with 10 kΩ negative temper-
ature coeﬃcient thermistors and their ead out is
based on the use of the ELMB. The control of our
custom made DCS hardware is based on the usage
of the ELMB (see below).

2. The Read out Chain

4. Power Supply System

For the data stream between the detector and
the read out system an optical transfer for most of
the distance of about 80 m will be used.

An opto board is used on the on-detector side
to convert the electrical signal into optical signals
and vice versa (Figure 2). The supply of this opto
board is handled by the SC-OLink 2 which is, like
all of the supply components, placed outside the
detector volume.

The control of the detector modules, the data
taking, and the histogramming of the data is han-
dled by a ROD 3 . On its back, a BOC 4 picks up
the optical transmitter Tx, the receiver Rx, and
the S-Link card. Inside the counting room, up to 16
ROD/BOC combinations are placed inside a VME
crate together with a single board computer which
handles the data stream.

The power supply system has to provide ﬂoating
channels to be compatible to the ATLAS ground-
ing scheme. Additionaly the outputs should be ad-
justable over the full range. A high granularity is
aimed for to keep the number of operating elements
as high as possible.

To provide the supply of the detector modules,
commercial power supplies will be used. They
will be placed outside the detector volume (oﬀ-
detector) in the ATLAS counting rooms. There-
fore, the services need to be longer than 100 m,
and additional devices are required to provide an
regulated input for the low voltage channels with
higher current to the devices (Figure 2).

To deplete the sensors an iseg 8 EHQ F007n-F
with 16 outputs will be used. In the beginning of
the experiment one channel will supply 6 or 7 de-
tector modules of a sector or a half-stave. In case of
increased leakage current inside the sensors due to
radiation damages, the modularity will be reduced
during the lifetime of the experiment.

For the low voltages (analog and digital) a
WIENER 9 power supply will provide these, us-
ing 2 channels to supply 6 or 7 detector modules
(corresponding again to a sector or a half-stave).
An active regulation station [5] inside the detector
volume will be used to regulate the 2 x 6 or 2 x 7
needed voltages for the whole sector or half-stave
using remote sensing.

4.1. The Supply and Control for the OptoLink

Supplying the opto board will be done by the SC-
OLink developed by the Wuppertal DCS group [5],
each opto board having its separate power supply
outputs. Its design is based on the use of the ELMB
whichs allows to control a high number of channels
economically priced.

The SC-OLink provides two low current chan-
nels (20 V and 5 V, 20 mA each), one 10 V 800 mA
channel, and one reset signal. Each of the out-
put channels uses a separate transformer input to
achieve a galvanic separation. The monitoring of
the voltages and currents are separated from the

The precision for the channels is better than 8 bit
for the output as well as for the monitored values.
On the digital side the used DACs 10 MAX 5122
are controlled by a SPI 11 , each one is separated
through opto couplers.
The 10 V 800 mA channel does not use remote sens-
ing, as it will be adjusted by the regulator station
using two regulators for redundancy.

4.2. The Regulator Station

To protect the frontend chips, which are fabri-
cated in deep-submicron technology, against tran-
sients, remotely programmable regulator stations
are installed as close to the detector modules as
possible. This radiation hard system has been de-
veloped by the INFN Milano group[5]. The regu-
lators compensate for the large voltage drops on
the low mass cables in the detector active volume.
In parallel they provide an individually adjustable
control of the low voltage lines for each detector
module. The core of the system is an ST regulator
LHC4913 from ST Microelectronics 12 , which can
provide a maximum current up to 3 A and accepts
input voltages up to 14 V. Using digital trimmers,
the output voltages can be adjusted. The control
is based on an FPGA (XC4036XLA-09HQ240C)

5. The Detector Control System

The DCS 14 is based on the development envi-
ronment PVSS II of the Austrian company ETM 15
and will be used in all LHC experiments to build
up the SCADA 16 systems. It enables the devel-
oper to establish all necessary connections to the
supply and protection system. To give the shifters
an overview over the system status, and to allow
them to operate the system, the DCS provides an
easy to use graphical user interface.

The core of the detector control system consists
of two major parts (Figure 4): front end integration
(power supplies, sensors...) and detector integra-
tion (detctor modules, half staves...). It is supple-
mented by the communication with the data tak-
ing system and a ﬁnite state machine to simplify
the control, which is currently under development.

16 Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition

To establish the connection to the front end
hardware, the FITs 17 are used. Besides being
the underlying layer for all other hardware DCS
components, the FIT also provides panels to mon-
itor and control the connected front end devices
(functional approach). Due to the rapidly chang-
ing test conditions, especially concerning changing
front end hardware, a ﬂexible solution for the FIT
was needed. This was realised by implementing a
separate FIT for each frontend device like the iseg
power supplies or the ELMB.

Additional FITs are being implemented to pro-
vide driver functionality for the WIENER power
supplies and the regulator stations which still had
to be monitored and controlled separately at the
system test in 2005. Using the DDC data transfer
(see below), a FIT for the BOC is currently under
development.

5.2. The System Integration Tool

The mapping of the channels to the detector de-
vices (Figure 4) is done by the SIT 18 , which has
a geographical structure. While relative small test
setups only require a limited number of hardware
connections (cabling), it will be impossible to man-
age all 35000 connections of the ﬁnal detector us-
ing a functional approach. Once the physically con-
nected hardware is connected to the DCS using
the FIT, the SIT will create a virtual image of the
detector inside the DCS. This image will then be
used to navigate through the detector’s geograph-
ical structure and to monitor and control the rele-
vant data. The system therefore allows for opera-
tion of the DCS without deeper knowledge of the
physical cabling, which was also tested at the sys-
tem test.

5.3. The DAQ-DCS Communication

During the experiment, the DAQ 19 system will
not only be responsible for taking physics data but
also for starting and stopping of runs. On the other
hand, DCS has to react correspondingly to ensure
correct detector operation. Therefore it is neces-
sary to synchronize the DAQ system with DCS.

For the synchronisation DDC 20 will be used[4].
The DCS structure will follow the DAQ hierarchy,
and on the bottom of the hierarchy the connection
between DAQ and DCS will be established. The
existing DDC package allows for the bidirectional
transfer of data, for the transfer of messages from
DCS to DAQ, and for the transfer of commands
from DAQ to DCS.

PID controller 21 . It determines the control vari-
able dependent on the deviation from the set point,
the sum of the deviations and the rate of change
of the deviation. The control variable is the input
current of a mass ﬂow controller which regulates
the nitrogen ﬂow through the cooling box. The cur-
rent of up to 200 mA is provided by a modiﬁed SC-
OLink card operating as a current source supply.
The aim was a fast falling of the dewpoint be-
low the setpoint. Once it is below the dewpoint
it should stay there without the need of constant,
manual adjustment of the nitrogen ﬂow. Further
the ﬂow rate should be minimized to reduce the
hereby introduced heat.

With the PID control and additional

imple-
mented alert handling it is now possible to operate
the system test without the need of an operator.

6. The System Test

6.2. The Power Supply System

The aim of the established system test is to vali-
date the concept of the overall design consisting of
the power supply and detector control system as
well as of the data acquisition system. Interactions
between the various components were investigated.
Of special interest are studies concerning noise and
crosstalk, which could be introduced by the power
supply system, the long services, or by the com-
mon mechanical structures. It consists of a bi-stave
mounted inside a cooling box to ensure controlled
environment (regarding temperature and humid-
ity) and to protect the detector modules against
light.

6.1. Environmental Control

To avoid condensation on the staves, the cool-
ing box is ﬂushed with nitrogen. Temperature and
relative humidity in the cooling box are monitored
and used to determine the dewpoint which is cal-
culated with the Magnus [6] formula. The actual
dewpoint is the input of a PVSS-script based on a

19 DAQ: Data Ac quisition
20 DDC: DAQ DCS Communication

The supply of the system test setup is based
on the components introduced in chapter 4. All
power supplies and the regulator station are used.
Additionally one half stave is equipped with ser-
vices as they will be used in the ﬁnal experiment.
Their characteristics, including their length, meet
the properties as requested for ATLAS.

The main diﬃculties during the installation and
test of the system were caused by ground loops. It
turned out that due to the long services potential
diﬀerences could be built up which made the in-
volved electronics non-operating (Figure 8). This
eﬀect made impact on the design of the regulator
station and the SC-OLink. The monitoring circuits
were therefor equipped with linear opto couplers
which guarantee in all conditions a ﬂoating range
larger than the required ± 10 V.

6.3. The Read out System

The data path is also geared to the one used in
the ATLAS experiment. An optical data transfer
to the ead out crate is established. The DAQ soft-

troller, standard feedback loop component in industrial

ware (STcontrol 22 ) developed by the Bonn group
is based on libraries of the ATLAS DAQ, as they
are available at the moment.

6.4. Procedure of the System Test

To evaluate the performance of the whole setup,
several tests for the digital and the analog part of
the the frontend electronics were enforced for each
detector module in several states. Starting at the
assembly of a detector module down to the ﬁnal
state when mounted on the stave and integrated
in the system test environment, all these tests to-
gether allow a rating of the detector module’s per-
formance.

Altogether we got results from four diﬀerent
tests for comparison. The ﬁrst two are using the
well understood laboratory setup, as used during
production qualiﬁcation. It is based on laboratory
power supplies with remote sensing, short services
and an electrical read out.
Module Assembly -

the individual detector
module is measured directly after its assembly
with the laboratory setup

Stave Assembly - after mounting all detector
modules on the stave the perfomance of each
detector module is veriﬁed using again the lab-
oratory setup
The last two results, obtained in the system test
(ST), are all based on the system foreseen for the
ﬁnal experiment, which was built up for the ﬁrst
time in its complexity. The power supply system
and the optical ead out chain as previously de-
scribed were used together with long, realistic ser-
vices.
ST separate operation - each detector module
of the stave is operated individually using the
ﬁnal setup

ST parallel operation - parallel operating of six
detector modules on a stave using the ﬁnal setup

assembly tests. This avoids impacts on the results
due to diﬀerences in the quality of the tuning. The
disadvantage of this procedure is the temperature
dependency of the results of the analog scans.

6.5.1. Digital

The digital part showed no eﬀect to the diﬀerent
states, but it was never considered as the critical
part sensitive to crosstalk.

6.5.2. Analog

The behaviour of the threshold (Figure 5) shows
a correlated behaviour for all detector modules for
each state. Obviously the threshold is also corre-
lated to the operating temperatures (Module As-
sembly @ 25 ◦C, Stave Assembly @ 27 ◦C, ST sep-
arate operation @ 18 ◦C and ST parallel operation
@ 20 ◦C), it raises with the temperature.

Fig. 5. Comparison of the threshold for the diﬀerent states

As only one conﬁguration was used and the
threshold of the pixel cells are non-uniformly
temperature dependent, the threshold dispersion
(Figure 6) increases with the diﬀerence between
the tuning temperature and the operation tem-
perature.

The noise (Figure 7) is only dependent on the
absolute temperature of the electronics and shows
no other eﬀect as would be expected for a potential
crosstalk.

All data scans were performed with the conﬁgu-
ration of the read out chips determined during the

A system test utilizing powering and services as
foreseen to be used for the ATLAS experiment has

number of detector modules operated in parallel to
check for crosstalk due to the additional hardware
and services introduced, as well as to demonstrate
the scalability of the readout system and the de-
tector control system.

8. Acknowledgments

For building up and debugging of the system
test setup, the knowledge and encouragement of all
participating institutes - especially of the ATLAS
pixel community - were necessary. The coopera-
tion was highly productive. Thanks to all involved
colleagues.

been constructed, and has provided valuable ﬁrst
operational experience. The detector control sys-
tem successfully ensured stable operation of the
system. The grounding scheme envisioned for the
experiment has been studied extensively, resulting
in a modiﬁed design for some components of the
power supply system.

The experience gained thus far from operating
the system test setup indicates that the system of
power supplies foreseen for the experiment, as well
as the optical readout chain, operate as desired
and introduce no problematic eﬀects to the system.
This has been veriﬁed by operating single modules
as well as several modules in parallel, where no
deleterious inﬂuence has been observed.

The only observable inﬂuence was due to the dif-
ferent temperatures of operation. To compensate
for the correlation of the threshold dispersion, the
detector modules will be tuned again for a set of
diﬀerent temperatures. This should allow a direct
comparison for one conﬁguration.

Another remaining objective is to scale up the

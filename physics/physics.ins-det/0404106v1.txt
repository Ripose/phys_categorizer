Transition Radiation Spectroscopy with Prototypes of the ALICE TRD

O. Busch∗ for the ALICE TRD collaboration†

We present measurements of the transition radiation (TR) spectrum produced in an irregular radiator at

diﬀerent electron momenta. The data are compared to simulations of TR from a regular radiator.

1. Motivation

Measurements of TR yield and spectra for a
large variety of regular radiator conﬁgurations
have been presented by diﬀerent authors. In gen-
eral, data conﬁrm the theoretical predictions [1],
although total TR yield and dependence on the
momentum of the emitting particle are not al-
ways reproduced [2][3]. The ALICE Transition
Radiation Detector (TRD) consists of 540 drift
chambers with mixed ﬁbre/foam radiators. The
expected performance of the detector in heavy-
ion collisions is investigated in detailed simu-
lations of the detector response. An accurate
numerical treatment of TR production in an
irregular-layered radiator requires knowledge of
the distributions of material thickness and spac-
ing in the medium [4], information usually not
easy to quantify with precision. A realistic im-
plementation of the ALICE TRD radiator in the
simulations requires measurements of the spectral
distribution of the emitted TR.

2. Setup and simulation

The measurements were carried out using a sec-
ondary beam at the CERN PS. A schematic draw-
ing of the setup is shown in Fig. 1. Two thresh-
old Cherenkov detectors provide oﬄine electron-
pion discrimination. We use two prototype
drift chambers (DC) described in [5], operated
with the standard gas mixture for the TRD,
Xe,CO2(15%), and read out via a low-noise fast
preampliﬁer-shaper and FADC. The radiator is
composed of 8 pure polypropylene ﬁbre mats, cor-

responding to 3.6 cm total thickness, in a box
of 6 mm carbon ﬁbre-enforced Rohacell c(cid:13) HF71.
It is separated from DC1 by a He-ﬁlled plexiglas
tube, 80 cm long, with 2 aluminum coated my-
lar foils of 10 µm thickness serving as gas barri-
ers. To deﬂect and separate the beam from the
TR photons, radiator, He pipe and the DCs are
placed in a dipole magnet. For beam momenta of
1.5, 2, and 3 GeV/c the magnetic ﬁeld strength
is B=0.42, 0.42, and 0.56 T, respectively. In ad-
dition, runs at B=0 are carried out for each mo-
mentum.

TR production is simulated tuning a regular
foil stack conﬁguration to reproduce the measure-
ments. The doubly diﬀerential TR yield d2W
~dωdΩ [1]
is integrated numerically over the solid angle Ω.
The parameters (220 polypropylene foils of 12 µm
thickness, separated by air gaps of 100 µm) re-
ﬂect typical dimensions of the radiator materials
[6], but are not unambiguously determined. We
use tabulated X-ray cross sections from [7] to cal-
culate photon absorption in the materials and the
chamber gas.

3. Charge reconstruction

The signal induced by beam particles and TR
photons is measured on a row of 8 readout pads.
The integrated pulse height is a measure of the
deposited charge. Photon scattering, the angu-
lar spread of the beam and the Lorentz angle
of the ionization drifting in the detector result
in a wide distribution of the charge from ab-
sorbed TR and beam ionization over the pads.
For each incident electron a TR cluster search is
performed, connecting time intervals with signal
over threshold on adjacent pads. Local minima
in the pulse height distribution occuring simulta-
neously on adjacent pads are detected to resolve
multiple overlapping photons. The position of the
incident beam is identiﬁed from the signal in DC2.
To avoid contamination of the measured spectra
due to overlap of beam and TR, a separation of
2 pads or more is required. In case the distance
is exactly 2 pads, the signal measured on the in-
terjacent pad can not be unambiguously assigned
to the beam or the TR cluster. In this case the
cluster is rejected unless the contribution of the
interjacent pad to the total charge of the cluster
is less than 5%.

In Fig. 2 we present the TR charge spectra mea-
sured in DC1 and DC2 (upper and center panel).
A smaller number of photons with higher average
energy is detected in DC2, since most of the TR
is deposited in DC1 or absorbed in the material
before DC2, and only a fraction of hard photons
penetrates into DC2. To assess the noise rejec-
tion power of the TR search algorithm we apply
it to the sample of incident pions. The resulting
charge spectrum of fake TR clusters is shown in
the lower panel of Fig. 2. Comparing the number
of entries to the total size of the pion sample, the
probability to produce a fake TR is found to be
smaller than 2%.

4. Cluster number distribution

In the upper panel of Fig. 3 we present the nor-
malised distribution of the detected photon num-
ber per incident electron for 2 GeV/c beam mo-
mentum. The shape of the distribution compares
well with a Poissonian, indicated by the dashed

curve. On average 0.61 photons per incident elec-
tron are detected. This number is smaller than
expected from simulations (∼0.8 for the measured
momenta). To some extent, TR overlap due to
the ﬁnite time response of the detector and asso-
ciated electronics accounts for this discrepancy,
as illustrated in the lower panel. The minimum
time interval between two TR photons resolved
in the measurements is 0.2 µs. Comparing to the
distribution obtained in simulations with ideal 2-
cluster resolution we ﬁnd an overlap probability
of 38%.

For higher momenta, increasing stiﬀness of the
beam results in smaller separation to the TR pho-
tons and stronger rejection of detected clusters.
As a consequence, the number of reconstructed
TR clusters drops to 0.43 for 3 GeV/c.

5. TR energy

To relate the measured charge to the corre-
sponding photon energy we compare the charge
deposit in pion runs at B=0 to the simulated
energy deposit [8]. To avoid any bias by single
track space charge eﬀects, which are maximal at
perpendicular beam incidence, we use the charge
collected at the beginning of the drift time, in
the ampliﬁcation region of the DC. The calibra-
tion factors obtained for each momentum from
the most probable values (m.p.v.) of the mea-
sured charge and simulated energy spectra agree
to an accuracy of 2.7%. The main sources of er-
rors are: 1) the uncertainty of the assignment of
the average pulse height distribution to the ampli-
ﬁcation region, which is determined for each run

2 GeV/c electron momentum.

In Fig. 4 we present the spectra of total TR en-
ergy and energy per photon for a beam momen-
tum of 2 GeV. The simulations reproduce the to-
tal TR spectrum, whereas the single photon spec-
trum has a more pronounced tail towards higher
energies than calculated, as a consequence of clus-
ter overlap. The evolution of the mean and m.p.v.
of the spectra as function of momentum is shown
in Fig. 5. The errors on the data points are a
5% uncertainty on the measured charge, reﬂect-
ing the tolerance of the TR search algorithm to
contamination from ionization, and the error of
the energy calibration. The m.p.v. of the spectra
is determined by a gaussian ﬁt to the maximum.

An additional error of 5% on the m.p.v. accounts
for the variation of the ﬁt with the ﬁt interval.
Within the measurement errors, which are domi-
nated by the systematic error of the calibration,
the simulations agree with the measured values.
Consistently with [5] we observe a systematic in-
crease of the TR yield as function of momentum.
This trend is not reproduced by the simulations.

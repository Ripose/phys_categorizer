Study of the ATLAS central calorimeters
response to pions in 2004 combined test beam

V. Giangiobbe

Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire de Clermont-Ferrand

Abstract. During summer 2004, a testbeam for the ATLAS experiment was performed at CERN.
A full slice of the ATLAS detector was tested with the ﬁnal version of the acquisition electronics. In
the talk presented at Calor06 conference, the ATLAS calorimeters response to high and low energy
pions was presented.

DESCRIPTION OF THE 2004 COMBINED TEST BEAM OF THE
ATLAS DETECTOR

Central calorimetry in ATLAS

−

The whole calorimetry in ATLAS is contained within a 12 m long cylinder with an
outer radius of about 4.2 m. This volume is divided into 3 part along h
. The central part
1.7 < h < 1.7. The electromagnetic calorimeter (LAr calorimeter)
called barrel, covers
uses lead as absorber and the active material is liquid argon. For the hadronic calorimeter
(TileCal) the absorber is iron and the active part consists of scintillating tiles. For
mechanical reason the central hadronic calorimetry is separated in 3 parts : 1 long barrel
< 1.7. Figure 1 shows the
for
calorimetry in ATLAS. The central calorimetry which will be the subject of the present
document has a light-grey color. The dark-grey circled region represents the part that
have been exposed to the beam during the 2004 combined test-beam.

Central calorimetry in 2004 combined test beam

The 2004 combined test-beam is the ﬁrst test of a full ATLAS slice (inner detector,
calorimetry and muon spectrometer). In the following only the calorimeter response
will be discussed. A top view of the calorimetry setup is shown on Figure 2. The LAr
calorimeter is on the bottom. Half a barrel of TileCal and 1 TileCal extended barrel are
also shown. The modules were laying on a rotative Table giving the possibility to shoot
the beam at various h positions (represented in Figure 2). Comparing with Figure 1 it can
be observed that the test-beam geometry is similar to the ATLAS one. Figure 3 shows
a side view of the calorimetry on the Table. We can see the LAr calorimeter within its
large cryostat, and 3 TileCal modules. The f -coverage is 0.4 in LAr and 0.3 in TileCal.

Data sample and energy reconstruction

During summer 2004, central ATLAS calorimeter modules have been exposed to
muons, pions and electron beams with different energies. In the following only the
results obtained using the pion beams are reported. The High Energy (HE) pions had
the following energies : 50, 100, 150, 180, 200, 250, 320 and 350 GeV. They had an
impact angle with respect to the surface of the detector corresponding to the pseudo-
rapidity values : h =0.20, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65. The Very Low Energy (VLE) pion
beams had energies ranging between 1 and 9 GeV and the same h values.

In LAr calorimeter the energy scale is obtained using the features of a discharging
capacitor. For TileCal, the energy scale is determined using the response of the detector
to electron beams. In the present analysis the energy that is deposited by pions in
calorimeters is reconstructed summing the energy of cells in a limited window around
the direction of the beam. It has been checked that the pion showers are well contained

PIONS THAT DO NOT INTERACT IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC
CALORIMETER

Around 20% of the high energy pions reach the hadronic calorimeter without producing
a shower in the electromagnetic section. These pions constitute an interesting probe to
check the performances of TileCal standalone and to establish the absolute energy scale
in TileCal. In this section the response (ratio between the reconstructed and the beam
energy) and the resolution of TileCal will be reported for high energy pions.

Event selection

Figure 4 shows the correlation between the deposited energy in the electromagnetic
and hadronic calorimeters for a 180 GeV beam. It can be seen on this plot that the high
energy pion beam contains a signiﬁcant fraction of muons and electrons. Muons give a
very small energy in both calorimeters while electrons deposit all their energy in LAr.
Muons and electrons can be easily rejected looking at the longitudinal proﬁle of the
energy in calorimeters. Pions showering in both calorimeters are visible in the center of
Figure 4 (anti-correlation between LAr and TileCal). Pions interacting only in TileCal
can be selected requesting a signal compatible with the one of a minimum ionizing
particle (mip) in each of the 4 longitudinal compartments of the LAr. This is not enough
to select pions reaching TileCal without early interaction. Indeed pions passing through
the LAr at their minimum of ionization can interact in the outer cryostat wall. In order to
reject such events an additional scintillator (called cryostat scintillator) has been placed
between the outer cryostat wall and the front face of TileCal (see Figure 2). A mip-
like signal is then requested also in the cryostat scintillator. Figure 5 shows the energy
distribution in TileCal for 180 GeV pions that pass the cuts described above (ie mip-
like signal in each LAr layer and in the cryostat scintillator). A Gaussian ﬁt has been
applied in order to estimate the mean reconstructed energy Eraw and the width s of the
distribution. The ﬁt was performed in a region of 2 sigmas around the peak value.

Response and resolution

Figure 6 shows the ratio between Eraw and the beam energy for different h positions.
Two different beams have been used during the data taking. One has a negative polarity
and is expected to contain only negative pions while the other one is a positive beam

for which a proton contamination is expected. It is a well known fact that protons
produce a lower response than pions in a non-compensating calorimeter like TileCal
[1]. For this reason and because it was not possible to separate pions and protons in
2004 combined test-beam, the response for positive and negative beams have been
represented separately in Figure 6. It can be noticed that, as expected, the response
for the positive beam, (150 and 180 GeV) is systematically lower than the negative
beam one at the same energy. The effect is around 1%. Looking at Figure 6 it can be
noticed that the calorimeter response is increasing with the beam energy. This behavior
is typical of a non-compensating calorimeter. At high energy (320 and 350 GeV), due
to the transversal and longitudinal leakage, the response decreases slightly. So far two
sources of systematic effect have been considered. The beam incident energy is known
with a 0.5% precision. The inﬂuence of the selection cuts has been estimated to be
of the order of 0.2%. This gives a global systematic uncertainty of around 0.5%. The
statistical error on the reconstructed energy is around 1%. It means that the statistical
error dominates the estimation of the TileCal response to pions.

The evolution of the resolution deﬁned as s /Eraw as a function of 1/√Ebeam it shown
in Figure 7. This study has been done using the negative beam (no protons) except at 50
and 100 GeV. A ﬁt function has been applied in order to estimate the sampling term a
and the constant term b :

The obtained parameters are given in Table 1. It has to be stressed that these results
have been obtained without any correction for leakage or non-compensation. For this
reason the resolution is not the best that can be achieved. The results of Table 1 are in
good agreement with results obtained in the same conditions during previous TileCal
standalone test-beams [2].

in calorimeters is computed as the sum of energy in LAr and energy in TileCal. No
correction for non-compensation, dead material or leakage has been applied. The aim
of this analysis is to provide the combined response that can be used to ﬁx the absolute
hadronic scale and that can be reproduced by the simulation. Figure 8 shows the energy
distribution in LAr, TileCal, and the sum of the energies in the two calorimeters for
180 GeV pions at h = 0.35. The reconstructed energy for pions that start showering
in TileCal (called penetrating pions) is also shown (bottom left). As before a Gaussian
ﬁt is applied on the total energy distribution and the mean reconstructed energy Erec is
obtained from the ﬁt.

Combined response

Figure 9 shows the ratio between the mean reconstructed pion energy and the beam
energy for different h positions. Again the response is showing the typical behavior of a
non-comensating calorimeter : the response increases as the beam energy increases (due
to the increase of the fraction of p 0 in the showers). The error on the pion response is
around 0.5%. It comes from the uncertainty on the beam energy.

CALORIMETERS RESPONSE TO VERY LOW ENERGY PIONS

Motivations

In addition to the high energy program, very low energy data have been taken during
the 2004 combined testbeam. From the calorimetry point of view this is motivated by the
fact that very low energy particles (namely E<10 GeV) have an important contribution in
jets. Figure 10 shows a simulation of the fraction of energy brought by charged particles
with E<10 GeV as a function of the jet energy. One observes that about 25% of the
energy in a 150 GeV jet is brought by particles with less than 10 GeV. Therefore we
need a good knowledge of the calorimeters response to very low energy particles in
order to check and tune the simulation of jets.

Selection of the very low energy pions

Very low energy (VLE) data have been taken at h =0.2, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65
for energies between 1 and 9 GeV. The VLE beam is a mixture of low energy pions,
electrons and muons from pion decay. Due to the conﬁguration of the beam line, a large
contamination by high energy muons is also expected.

electrons. The scatter plot in Figure 11 shows on the x-axis the signal (in adc channel)
in the Cerenkov counter and on the y-axis the number of hits in TRT. In TRT, pions are
expected to produced less transition radiation X-ray than electrons. In the Cerenkov
counter a lower signal is expected for pions than for electrons. Electrons and pions
(together with muons) can be clearly identiﬁed on Figure 11. The following cuts have
been applied to select pions : Cerenkov < 630 adc and number of hits
2 (grey lines on
Figure 11).

≤

Once electrons have been rejected we still have to deal with the contamination of high
energy muons. High energy muons give a higher signal than very low energy pions in
the last TileCal layer. Indeed VLE pions are expected to lose most of their energy before
reaching the end of TileCal. High energy muons can be rejected asking less than a given
energy in the last TileCal layer. Above 5 GeV this cut can introduce a bias because some
pions can reach this layer. Nevertheless such a cut is easy to reproduce in the simulation.
Figure 12 shows the distribution of the total energy as a function of the energy in the
last TileCal layer. A large cloud with a total energy around 2 GeV is observed. This
is the expected signal for high energy muons. The following cut has been chosen to
select pions : E in the last TileCal layer < 150 MeV (grey line in Figure 12). Once pions
have been separated from electrons and muons, the energy Eraw is determined ﬁtting the
total energy distribution with a Gaussian function. Eraw corresponds to the mean of the
function. Again no corrections have been applied to take into account the dead material
effects.

Calorimeters response to VLE pions

Very low energy pions have been selected as described above for various energies
and h positions. Figure 13 gives the dependence of the response (Eraw/Ebeam) as a
function of h
. Due to the low number of pions available, the uncertainty on the response
is dominated by the statistical error on the mean reconstructed energy. This statistical
error varies from 1% at 9 GeV to 4% at 5 GeV. The error on the knowledge of the beam
energy is 0.3%. Systematic effects of the selection cuts have to be studied.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKS

In this note results concerning the response of ATLAS central calorimeter to pions have
been presented. Data collected during a CERN testbeam were used. The results were
obtained studying :

• all high energy pions (energy larger than 50 GeV)
• high energy pions that start showering in TileCal
• very low energy pions (energy lower than 9 GeV)

The study of pions which start to produce a shower in TileCal has been performed
in order to determine the hadronic absolute scale for TileCal and to compare TileCal
performances in 2004 with the results obtained during previous standalone TileCal test-
beams. From this analysis one can conclude that the resolution obtained in 2004 is
compatible with the values obtained during previous test-beams. The uncertainty on
TileCal response to pions is around 1% (dominated by the statistical error).

For the combined LAr+TileCal response to high energy pions, the uncertainty is less

than 1%. It is dominated by the error on the beam energy.

For very low energy pions, the error on the LAr+TileCal response ranges from 1% at
9 GeV to 4% at 5 GeV. Work is still in progress for the determination of the systematic

h
error introduced by the selection cuts (pion/electron separation, pion/muon separation,
beam proﬁle...).

At the end of the talk possible jet calibration strategy in ATLAS were discussed.
The response of the ATLAS calorimeters has been obtained (in the 2004 testbeam
conﬁguration). The next step, which is already in progress, is to compare these results to
the simulation in the same conditions (simulation of the test beam geometry). If needed
the simulation will be tuned according to the testbeam results (amount of dead material,
shower development...). Once a good agreement will be achieved, correction for dead
material, leakage, e/p will be derived from simulation. Algorithms could be proposed
in order to improve the calorimeters performances for single pions (like weighting
techniques to improve linearity and resolution). The ﬁnal objective is to obtain the jet
absolute energy scale with a good linearity and resolution.

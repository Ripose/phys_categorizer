106 e leading to gain saturation when the total charge is

Results obtained with a triple GEM detector operated in pure CF4 with and without a re-
ﬂective CsI photocathode are presented. The detector operates in a stable mode at gains up
to 104. A deviation from exponential growth starts to develop when the total charge exceeds
107 e and making the

structure relatively robust against discharges. No aging eﬀects are observed in the GEM foils
10 mC/cm2 at the anode. The ion back-ﬂow current to
after a total accumulated charge of
the reﬂective photocathode is comparable to the electron current to the anode. However, no
signiﬁcant degradation of the CsI photocathode is observed for a total ion back-ﬂow charge
of

7 mC/cm2.

1 Introduction

A Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) is being considered for an upgrade of the PHENIX
detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL [1]. The HBD will
allow the measurement of electron-positron pairs from the decay of the light vector
1 GeV/c2) in Au-Au
mesons, ρ, ω and φ and the low-mass pair continuum (mee
collisions at energies up to √sN N = 200 GeV. From Monte Carlo simulations and
general considerations, the main HBD speciﬁcations are: electron identiﬁcation with
very high eﬃciency (>90%), double hit recognition better than 90%, moderate pion
rejection factor of about 200, and radiation budget of the order of 1% of a radiation
length. The primary choice under study is a windowless Cherenkov detector, operated in
pure CF4 in a special proximity focus conﬁguration, with a reﬂective CsI photocathode
and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [2] detector element with a pad readout.

The proposed scheme is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from other HBD designs [3,4]. The com-
bination of a windowless detector with a CsI photocathode and CF4 results in a very
large bandwidth (from 6 to 11.5 eV) and a very high ﬁgure of merit N0 = 940. With
these unprecedented numbers, one expects approximately 40 detected photo-electrons
per incident electron in a 50 cm long radiator, thus ensuring the necessary high levels
of single electron detection eﬃciency and double hit recognition. The scheme foresees
the detection of the Cherenkov photoelectrons in a pad plane with the pad size ap-
10 cm2). This results in a
proximately equal to the photoelectron space distribution (
low granularity detector. In addition to that, since the photoelectrons produced by a
single electron will be distributed between at most three pads, one can expect a primary
charge of at least 10 e per pad allowing to operate the detector at a relatively moderate
gain of a few times 103.

In this paper, we report on the operation in pure CF4 of a triple GEM detector, with
and without a CsI photocathode evaporated on the top face of the ﬁrst GEM. Ex-
10 cm2 detectors have been performed using a Hg
tensive studies using 3
UV lamp, an Fe55 X-ray source and an Am241 alpha source. All measurements were
also performed with the conventional Ar/CO2 (70/30%) gas mixture for comparison.
Section 2 describes the various setups and conditions under which the measurements
were performed. The studies include measurements of the gain ampliﬁcation curve of
the triple GEM structure without (section 3) and with a reﬂective CsI photocathode
(section 5), discharge probability in the presence of the high ionization induced by the
Am241 α-particles (section 4) and ion back-ﬂow to the photocathode (section 6). A short
summary and conclusions are presented at the end of the paper in section 7.

For all the measurements, GEMs produced at CERN were used with 50 µm kapton
thickness, 5 µm thick copper layers, 60-80 µm diameter holes and 140 µm pitch. The

stack with G10 frames as shown in Fig. 1. The distance between the GEMs was 1.5
mm and the distance between the bottom GEM (GEM3) and the printed circuit board
(PCB) was in most (some) cases 2 mm (1.5 mm). The distance between the top GEM
(GEM1) and the drift mesh was 3 mm in the measurements with X-rays and α-particles
and 1.5 mm in the measurements with UV-photons.

The PCB consisted of 5 strips of 100
either to a charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer and shaper or to a picoammeter, depending
on the particular measurement. The other groups were grounded.

Two gases were used for the measurements in this work: an Ar/CO2 (70/30%) mixture
and CF4. We used a premixed bottle of Ar/CO2 with Ar of 99.999% purity and CO2 of
99.998% purity. The purity of the CF4 was 99.999%.

High voltage was supplied to the GEM electrodes via a resistive chain (see Fig. 1). For
most of the measurements, the resistors R were equal to 10 MΩ whereas the resistor
R1 feeding the gap between GEM3 and PCB (see Fig.1) was equal to 20 MΩ. In some

measurements with X-rays and α-particles R1 was equal to 10 MΩ. For some measure-
ments an independent voltage supply for selected electrodes was used. In particular,
this was required for the measurement of the ion current to the top electrode of GEM1,
while studying the ion back-ﬂow (see below).

We use the gap names and the ﬁeld notations as proposed in [5], i.e. the gap between the
mesh and top GEM is called ”drift” and the corresponding ﬁeld is referred to as Ed; the
gaps between GEMs are called ”transfer” and the corresponding ﬁelds are referred to as
Et; the gap between GEM3 and the PCB is called ”induction” and the corresponding
ﬁeld is referred to as Ei. Most measurements were performed with a 2 mm induction
gap and a 20 MΩ resistor feeding it. In this conﬁguration, when the voltage across the
104 in CF4 (Ar/CO2), the transfer
GEMs is 510 (370) V, corresponding to a gain of
and induction ﬁelds are about 3.4 (2.5) kV/cm and 5.1 (3.7) kV/cm, respectively. When
R1 is equal to 10 MΩ, the induction ﬁelds are half the quoted values. The ability of the
GEM to transport electrons through its holes is referred to as ”electron transparency”.
It is the product of two factors: the fraction of electrons collected from the top gap into
the holes and the fraction of electrons extracted from the holes into the bottom gap. The
electron transparency of the GEMs with the voltages and ﬁelds indicated above, can be
derived from the data presented in [5]. For GEM1 and GEM2 the electron transparency
is close to 1, while for GEM3 it is about 0.7 in the case of the lower induction ﬁeld and
approaches 1 for the high induction ﬁeld.

The photocathode was prepared by evaporating a
ﬁrst GEM previously coated with thin layers of Ni and Au to avoid chemical interaction
with the CsI ﬁlm. For the operation with the reﬂective photocathode the drift ﬁeld has
to be zero or even reversed in order to collect all the photo-electrons from the CsI
layer [6]. For those measurements the corresponding resistor in the chain was shorted.
The measurements with the CsI reﬂective photocathode were performed with a Hg lamp
and a UV-transparent window (CaF2) in the cover of the detector box. The lamp was
1000
positioned at the detector window with an absorber that reduced the UV ﬂux
times to avoid possible damage of the photocathode [7]. The illuminated area of the
detector was about 100 mm2. In this geometry, the measured photo-electron current
was about 2

106 e/(mm2

s).

The detector assembly (drift mesh, triple-GEM, and PCB) were mounted in a stainless
steel box that could be pumped down to 10−6 torr and was connected to the inlet
and outlet gas lines to allow gas ﬂushing. All measurements were done at atmospheric
pressure with an overpressure of 0.5 torr in the detector vessel. The system contained
also devices for the precise measurement of temperature, pressure and water content
down to the ppm level. The Fe55 X-ray source was positioned inside the box at a distance
of
40 mm from the mesh. The total rate of X-rays was kept at the level of 1 kHz. 5.9
keV photons from Fe55 release 210 e in Ar/CO2 (26 eV per electron-ion pair) and 110
e in CF4 (54 eV per electron-ion pair) [8].

The discharge limit in the presence of heavily ionizing particles was studied with an
Am241 source that emits 5.5 MeV α-particles. The source in a container was attached
directly to the drift mesh and strongly collimated in order to provide high energy
deposition and small energy dispersion in the drift gap. The rate of the α-particles
300 Hz. The distance between the active surface of the source and
varied between 100
10 mm. The range of 5.5 MeV α-particles in Ar/CO2 is

For the study of gain limits we needed a reliable way to monitor the discharges in the
triple GEM assembly. The resistor chain voltage was supplied by a HV power supply
CAEN N126. This module allowed us to install a protection against over-current with a
precision of 0.1 µA. The protection threshold was always kept at 5 µA above the chain
current which was usually in the range between 50 and 100 µA. This was enough to
cause a trip when a discharge occurred in a single GEM. The trip signal was reset after
1 second and counted by a scaler.

3 Gain in Ar/CO2 and CF4.

The gain as a function of the voltage across the GEM (∆VGEM ) was measured with all
GEMs at the same voltages for both Ar/CO2 and pure CF4. The absolute gas gain was
determined from the measurements of the signal from Fe55 5.9 keV X-ray photons. An
example of the pulse height spectrum for both gases is shown in Fig. 2. For Ar/CO2 the
main peak is very well separated from the escape peak of Ar and the energy resolution

22% FWHM. For CF4 the energy resolution is close to 38% FWHM. In both cases

the pulse height spectra were measured at a gain higher than 104.

The gain was calculated, using the measured relationship between the output signal
from the ampliﬁer and the input charge to a calibration capacitor and taking into
account the average charge produced by one 5.9 keV photon (see previous section).

Fig. 3 shows the typical gain curves measured with 5.9 keV X-rays in Ar/CO2 and CF4
using small and large GEMs. Several detector sets were used and good reproducibility
between the various sets was observed. Comparing the data for Ar/CO2 and CF4 in
Fig. 3 one can see that the operational voltage for CF4 is
140 V higher but the slopes
of the gain-voltage characteristics are similar for both gases, i.e. an increase of 20 V in
∆VGEM causes an increase of the gain by a factor of
3. The gain in CF4 can reach
values above 105, in spite of the very high operational voltage, as was already reported
in [11].

∼

∼

The absolute value of the gain is very sensitive to the gas density. Small variations of the
gas pressure (P ) and/or temperature (T ) signiﬁcantly aﬀect the gain as demonstrated
in Fig. 4. A change of 1% in the P/T value causes a gain variation of 17% in Ar/CO2
and of 26% in CF4.

Another feature of CF4 which can be seen in Fig. 3 is the strong deviation from expo-
nential growth at high gains. This “non-linearity” is much more pronounced when the

detector is irradiated with Am241 α-particles (Fig. 5). In that ﬁgure the saturation level
of the pre-ampliﬁer is marked with a dashed line. In the case of Ar/CO2 the charge de-
pends on ∆VGEM exponentially, and the signal is saturated by the pre-ampliﬁer. In pure
CF4, on the other hand, the dependence of charge versus ∆VGEM becomes non-linear
107 e, which is below
106 e and is completely saturated at
above the value of
the saturation level of the pre-ampliﬁer. This diﬀerence in performance in Ar/CO2 and
pure CF4 may be due to the higher primary charge density and lower diﬀusion in CF4.
These two features make the charge cluster in CF4 more compact and dense and, as a
consequence, increase the electric ﬁeld inside the charge cloud resulting in the satura-
tion of the avalanche. This saturation eﬀect is of prime importance for the anticipated
application of the HBD in the PHENIX experiment where single photoelectrons are to
be detected in a high multiplicity environment of charged particles.

4 Discharge probability in the presence of heavily ionizing particles.

Stability of operation and absence of discharges in the presence of heavily ionizing
particles is crucial for the operation of the HBD. The Am241 source was used to simulate
heavily ionizing particles under laboratory conditions. We determined quantitatively the
probability of discharge as the ratio between the number of discharges within a certain
period of time and the number of α-particles traversing the detector during the same
period. The discharge probability was measured in small GEMs and the results are
shown in Figs. 6a and 6b in two diﬀerent forms: as a function of GEM voltage and as
a function of gain.

For the Ar/CO2 mixture the probability of discharge exhibits a rapid increase between
104. In terms of gain
400 V and 420 V across the GEM when the gain reaches 3
and GEM voltage these results agree with similar data from [9]. In CF4 the discharge
probability grows at ∆VGEM above 590 V with both Ei = 2.6 kV/cm and Ei = 5.1
kV/cm. The second setup also had a CsI photocathode on GEM1. From Fig. 5 one can
see that the signal from α-particles in CF4 is completely saturated above ∆VGEM
540
107 e. As a consequence, the total charge produced by the
V at the level of

heavily ionizing particle is limited to below the Raether limit [10] and its ability to
provoke a discharge is strongly suppressed. Thus, the gain in CF4 even in the presence
of α-particles can reach extremely high values of close to 106. The HBD is expected to
104, i.e. with a comfortable margin below the discharge threshold.

values of the induction ﬁeld Ei refer to a gain of 104. The error bars represent the statistical
error. The two highest points for CF4 represent a lower limit of the discharge probability.

The measurements of the discharge probability were also performed with the large GEM
setup. However during the measurement in CF4 the GEMs were severely damaged by
the very ﬁrst spark and a similar study could not be conducted for this setup. The
damage to the GEM was severe due to the combination of high operational voltage
and high capacitance which results in the energy deposited in the discharge being too
high. We plan to repeat the studies with large GEMs with a proper segmentation of
the GEMs so as to reduce their capacitance.

5 Operation with the CsI reﬂective photocathode.

In all the tests with the CsI photocathode a mercury lamp was used for irradiation.
In order to determine the total emission from the photocathode itself without any am-

8

pliﬁcation in the GEMs, we applied a positive voltage between GEM1 and the mesh,
thus collecting the emitted photo-electrons in the mesh. The operation of the CsI pho-
tocathode is shown in Fig. 7, where the photo-electron current as a function of voltage
(7a) and time (7b) is plotted. From Fig. 7a it is seen that in order to measure the full
photo-electron emission the voltage between the mesh and GEM1 has to exceed 200
V or, since the drift gap was 1.5 mm, the ﬁeld has to be higher than 1.3 kV/cm, in
agreement with [11].

The lines are to guide the eye.

In Fig. 7b the value of the current to the mesh as a function of time is shown, demon-
strating that one has to wait about 30 min after the application of the HV in order to
stabilize the signal. As CsI is a semi-insulating material, this initial instability of the
signal might be caused by polarization and up-charging of the layer.

The study of the triple GEM detector with a reﬂective photocathode was always per-
formed in the regime with Ed = 0. Fig. 8 shows the current to the PCB as a function of
the GEM voltage for the small GEM setup. The measurements were done in Ar/CO2
and CF4. In the CF4 curve we can clearly see two regions well described by two expo-
nential dependencies on ∆VGEM (see lines in Fig. 8): an initial slow increase of current
at lower voltages related to the increase of the extraction of the photo-electrons from
the CsI surface into the holes of GEM1 and a steep exponential increase at higher volt-

9

ages due to ampliﬁcation in the GEMs. A detailed discussion of these processes and
the transition from one region to the other can be found in [12]. In Ar/CO2 these two
regions are not so clearly separated because ampliﬁcation in this mixture starts at lower
voltages. The electron extraction cannot exceed the maximum level shown in Fig. 7a. It
indeed seems to reach this level of 100% extraction indicated by the dashed line in Fig.
8. Thus, the gain is determined as the ratio between the current to the PCB and the
the extraction current. The latter is given by the ﬁrst exponential curve up to ∆VGEM
= 350 V and by the 100% extraction value at higher values of ∆VGEM .

6 Ion back-ﬂow in the triple GEM detector operating with a reﬂective

photocathode.

The ﬂow of positive ions to the CsI layer is one of the potential damaging factors that
can cause aging of the photocathode [7,13,14,15]. We call this factor ion back-ﬂow and
characterize it by the ratio between the current to the top electrode of GEM1 and the
current to the PCB. This ratio depends on both the ion current itself and the fraction
of electron current ﬂowing to the PCB. This is a convenient deﬁnition as it allows us
to estimate the actual ion current from the measured signal at the PCB. In order to
measure the current to the photocathode we supplied the voltage separately to the
top electrode of GEM1 with a CAEN N126 power supply. The voltages to all other
electrodes were supplied through the resistive chain.

In Fig. 10 the ratio of the current to the photocathode and the current to the PCB (ion
back-ﬂow factor) as a function of gain is shown for diﬀerent conditions. The errors on the
plots are mainly due to the limited accuracy of the photocathode current measurements.
The value of the induction ﬁeld was changed by changing the corresponding resistor in
the chain and the value, indicated in the caption (5.1 kV/cm), is reached at a gain of
104.

In Fig. 10a we see that in spite of the very diﬀerent transport properties of the gases
used in the measurements no signiﬁcant dependence of the ion back-ﬂow factor on the
nature of the gas is observed as a function of gain and for diﬀerent induction ﬁelds.
The insensitivity of the ion back-ﬂow factor to the particular gas at moderate gains is
similar to that seen in [14]. It means that the eﬃciency of the transport of electrons and
ions through the GEMs is the same for both gases and does not depend on diﬀusion.

The insensitivity of the ion back-ﬂow factor to the electric ﬁeld between the GEMs and
in the GEM is demonstrated in Fig. 10b. Here the value of the ion back-ﬂow factor as a
function of gain is shown for three diﬀerent electrostatic conditions: 1) standard, when
the transfer ﬁeld is equal to 3.4 kV/cm for both gaps and the induction ﬁeld is equal to
5.1 kV/cm (the values refer to a gain of 104), 2) enhanced transfer ﬁeld in both gaps,
3) reduced ﬁeld in GEM1. From Fig. 10b we see that neither variation in electrostatic
conditions between nor inside the GEMs aﬀect signiﬁcantly the ion back-ﬂow factor.

The only parameter which aﬀects the value of the ion back-ﬂow in our case is the
induction ﬁeld. Fig. 10c shows the value of the ion back-ﬂow factor as a function of the
gain for 3 values of the induction ﬁeld. The ﬁeld in the induction gap does not aﬀect
the ion ﬂow itself as ions are produced in the holes of the last GEM or in their vicinity,
collected into the holes and then transported to the top gap. The only factor that is
aﬀected is the electron ﬂow from GEM3 to the PCB. Thus the ion back-ﬂow factor
being higher than one at low induction ﬁeld means that a fraction of the electrons is
collected at the bottom face of GEM3 and consequently the amount of ions reaching
the photocathode can be larger than the amount of electrons collected at the PCB. The
increase of the induction ﬁeld improves the electron collection eﬃciency at the PCB
and reduces the value of the ion back-ﬂow factor. It is clear from the ﬁgure that for
Ei above 5 kV/cm the collection eﬃciency does not increase signiﬁcantly resulting in

We have presented very encouraging results on the operation of a triple GEM detector
in pure CF4 with and without a reﬂective CsI photocathode. The slope of the gain
curve is similar to that of the conventional Ar/CO2 (70/30%) gas mixture, however
140 V higher voltage across the GEMs is needed for a given gain. The gain curve
∼
starts deviating from exponential growth when the total charge in the detector exceeds
106 e, and the gain is fully saturated when the total avalanche charge reaches
∼
107 e. This is an interesting property making the system more robust against
∼
discharges as compared to Ar/CO2. Stable operation can be achieved at gains up to
104 in the presence of heavily ionizing particles. No deterioration of the GEM foil
performance in a pure CF4 atmosphere was observed for a total accumulated charge of
10 mC/cm2 at the PCB. The ion back-ﬂow to the photocathode is close to 100%,
∼
independent of the operating gas and of the transfer ﬁeld Et between successive GEMs.
At a gain of 104, the ion back-ﬂow factor can be reduced to
70% by applying a
relatively high induction ﬁeld of Ei
5 kV/cm. In spite of the high ion back-ﬂow no
sizable deterioration of the CsI quantum eﬃciency was observed when the photocathode
7 mC/cm2. This value is larger by about two
was exposed to a total ion charge of
orders of magnitude than the total integrated ion charge density expected during the
lifetime of the planned HBD.

Abstract

We describe the particle identiﬁcation capability of the CLEO RICH system. This
system consists of a 1 cm thick LiF radiator coupled to a photon detector that uses
wire proportional chambers ﬁlled with a mixture of CH4 and TEA. We discuss the
yield of photoelectrons observed per ring and the angular resolution. We show the
eﬃciencies achieved for particle identiﬁcation and the associated fake rates from data
collected with both CLEO III and CLEO-c detectors. Finally we show examples of
the particle separation ability which is excellent for both CLEO III and CLEO-c
data.

1 Introduction

In 1999 a particle identiﬁcation
system based on Ring Imaging
Cherenkov detector (RICH) technol-
ogy, a new vertex detector and a new
wire drift chamber were added to the
CLEO detector to probe physics of
the decays of b and c quarks, τ lep-
tons and Υ mesons produced near
10 GeV in e+e− collisions [1]. With
RICH, the goal was to achieve a

π/K separation greater than 4σ up
to 2.65 GeV/c, the mean momentum
for pions from B → ππ decays. At
this momentum, the Cherenkov an-
gle between π and K in LiF diﬀers
by 14.3 mrad. We expect to have in
a 1 cm thick sample at this momen-
tum about 12 detected photons with
a resolution per photon of 14 mrad
yielding to an angular resolution per
track of 4 mrad. This resolution is
enough for more than 3σ separation
in addition to the 2σ separation pro-
vided by dE/dx information in the
drift chamber for momenta higher
than 2.2 GeV/c. In this paper, we
compare these expectations with the
physics performance of the detector
that has been used for more than
4 years in CLEO III and recently
in CLEO-c at lower center-of-mass

2 Detector Description

Cherenkov photons are produced in
a shell of 1 cm thick LiF crystal radi-
ators which, up to a 22o angle from
the center of the solenoid, are saw-
tooth radiators [2] and the rest pla-
nar. The sawtooth radiators are used
to prevent total internal reﬂection of
Cherenkov photons where charged
particles cross the detector at near
normal incidence. The photons then
enter a 15.6 cm thick expansion
volume ﬁlled with pure N2 gas, as
shown in Fig. 1, and get detected
in multiwire proportional chambers.
The chambers have CaF2 windows

Charge signals induced on an array
of 230,400 7.5 mm x 8 mm cathode
pads are used to measure the posi-
tion of the Cherenkov photons using
custom made low noise and high dy-

namic range VA RICH ASIC’s that
convert the charge signals into dif-
ferential current signals in order to
minimize cross talk in the cables
connecting the front end electronics
to the data boards. The back end
electronics include transimpedance
receivers that transform the current
signals into voltage signals which get
digitized afterwards by 12-bit dif-
ferential ADC’s in the data boards
located in the VME crates. More
details can be found in [3] and [4].

3 PHYSICS PERFORMANCE

3.1 Photon Resolution and Photon

Yield

The physics performance studies
were made previously [3] using either
Bhabha or hadronic events 1 where
the single photon resolution parame-
ter σθ is the RMS width of the diﬀer-
ence between the measured and the
expected single-photon Cherenkov
angle distribution. The photon yield
per track is extracted from the ﬁtted
and background subtracted photon
yield per track distribution. Con-
sequently, the Cherenkov angle per
track is found as the arithmetic mean
of all photoelectrons in an image
within ±3σ for each hypothesis. A
summary of the averaged values of

1 Here, photons that match the most
likely mass hypothesis within ±3σ were
removed from consideration for the
other tracks to resolve overlaps between
Cherenkov images for diﬀerent tracks.

The components of the Cherenkov
angular resolution per track are com-
pared with the data as shown in
Fig. 2. The resolution is mainly dom-
inated by the chromatic dispersion
and the error on the photon emission
point. Smaller components include
the error on the reconstructed pho-
ton position and the error on the
charged track’s direction and posi-
tion determination.

3.2 Particle ID Likelihood: Deﬁni-
tion and Operating Modes

The particle identiﬁcation criteria we
are using for CLEO III and CLEO-
c analysis is diﬀerent from what we
presented in the last section where
only the optical path with the clos-
est Cherenkov angle to the expected
one was considered. Here, the infor-
mation on the value of the Cherenkov
angle and the photon yield for each
hypothesis is translated into a Likeli-
hood of a given photon being due to
a particular particle. Contributions

The CLEO III data at e+e− center-
of-mass energies around 10 GeV have
been used to evaluate the RICH per-
formance. Since the charge of the
slow pion in the D∗+ → π+D0 decay
is opposite to the kaon charge in the
subsequent D0 → K −π+ decay, the
kaon and pion in the D0 decay can
be identiﬁed without the RICH in-
formation. The eﬃciencies and fake
rates are hence extracted by study-
ing the RICH identiﬁcation selectiv-
ity on the particle species selected
with the D∗ tag. Here the D0 mass
peak in the K −π+ mass distribution
is ﬁtted to obtain the number of sig-
nal events for each momentum inter-
val. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of
2 ln (Lπ/LK), which is equivalent to
the χ2 diﬀerence in the Gaussian ap-
proximation, for the identiﬁed kaons
and pions with 1.0 − 1.5 GeV/c mo-
mentum.

K − χ2

At lower center-of-mass energies near
4 GeV, the CLEO-c program has
started extensive studies of charm
meson decays. In these analyses, one
of the D’s is reconstructed through
hadronic channels while the other D
is used as a signal side for various
studies. For π/K ID eﬃciency mea-
surements pions from D0 → Kππ0,
D0 → Ksππ and D+ → K −π+π+
decays and kaons from D0 → Kππ0
and D+ → K −π+π+ decays are used.
The particle identiﬁcation eﬃciency
is deﬁned in this case as the ratio of
the number of D0 events that passed
the particle ID criteria to the number
of D0 events without any PID. Eﬃ-
ciencies and fake rates for 0.9 GeV/c
momentum pions and kaons from
the data with a χ2
π cut at 0 are
summarized at the end of Table 2.

3.3 Example of Particle ID Perfor-

mance

We used recently 0.42 fb−1 of data
taken on the Υ(5S)
resonance,
6.34 fb−1 of data collected on the
Υ(4S) and 2.32 fb−1 of data taken
in the continuum below the Υ(4S)
with the CLEO III detector
to

measure

never been measured before. In this
analysis, we reconstructed Ds mesons
through the decay mode: Ds → φπ
and φ → KK where we used the
RICH information to identify one of
the kaons with a momentum higher
than 0.62 GeV/c. We show in Fig. 7
for instance the large combinatoric
backgrounds, from the Υ(4S) on res-
onance data mentioned above, that
we would have included in the Ds
candidates invariant mass spectrum
if we didn’t take advantage of the
particle identiﬁcation of one of the
kaons.

4 Conclusions

The CLEO LiF-TEA RICH is pro-
viding us with excellent particle iden-
tiﬁcation for all momenta relevant to
the CLEO III beauty threshold data
and present charm threshold CLEOc
data. It has operated successfully for
over 4 years.

We have made and are making ex-
tensive studies of the Upsilon, B and
Bs decays and, since last year, we
have used the detector for the CLEO-
c program to study charm mesons
and charmonium decays. Thus, the
physics performance of the CLEO
RICH detector has met the bench-
marks and the design criteria.

Abstract
In this course, given at the school in 3 parts of 75 minutes each, we will discuss
the physics of particle detection, the basic designs and working principles of
detectors, and, as an example with more details, some detectors for particle
identiﬁcation.

1.

Introduction

The detection and identiﬁcation of particles and nuclei is not only important in high-energy physics, but
also in cosmic ray and nuclear physics. The basic idea is that every effect of particles or radiation can
be used as a working principle for a detector. The main purpose is the detection and identiﬁcation of
particles with mass m and charge z. In particle physics, the charge is usually z = 0,
1, but in nuclear,
heavy ion physics, or cosmic rays, also higher charges are possible.

±

Examples of effects used for particle detection and identiﬁcation include the momentum p mea-
p/z = γmβc/z); the velocity
sured by deﬂecting a charged particle (charge z) in a magnetic ﬁeld (ρ
1/t) or the Cherenkov angle (θC = 1/(βn)), the total
v measured by the time of ﬂight t (β = v/c
energy E measurements with a calorimeter, and for charge z measurement the ionization energy loss
(dE/dx

z2). With all the information together one can determine the quadri-vector of the particle.
The basic detection techniques work mostly for charged particles only; neutral particles are usually

∝

∝

∝

detected indirectly via reactions producing charged particles.

Designing instrumentation and detectors requires knowledge of the basic physics of interactions
of charged and neutral particles with matter, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering (high volt-
age), electronic engineering, interfaces to trigger, data acquisition and computing, software engineering
(calibration), and operation (stability). To know any one of them is not sufﬁcient; all have to be applied
together to build, operate and use an instrument for a physics measurement. The ﬁnal goal of the mea-
surement and the precision (resolution) needed has always to be kept in mind, in order not to over-design
the instrument.

The recommended literature includes, in addition to references throughout the lecture, the follow-
ing: Particle Detectors by Claus Grupen [1], Detectors for particle radiation by Konrad Kleinknecht [2],
Introduction to Experimental Particle Physics by Richard C. Fernow [3], Calorimetry by Richard Wig-
mans [4], lecture notes and proceedings of ICFA Instrumentation Schools [5], which are held bi-yearly
since 1987, recently also as regional schools, and the Particle Data Book [6], which contains short
summaries of important topics.
In the new 2004 edition [7] a rewritten and upgraded section about
instrumentation will be included.

2.2 Energy Loss of Charged Particles

The interaction of charges particles with matter is dominated by the electromagnetic interaction, via the
exchange of virtual or real photons. Virtual photons are absorbed by the atoms of the material which
leads to ionization and/or excitation of the atoms. Real photons, also called radiation, is emitted by a
charged particle if: 1. its velocity is faster than the velocity of light in the medium (v > c/n) and is
called Cherenkov radiation. 2. if the vector velocity relative to the phase velocity of photons in matter
is called Bremsstrahlung, a

The Energy transfer ǫ in this collision is given in a classical approximation by

The interaction rate Φ, measured in cm2/g, with an atomic cross section σ, is given by

In ﬁg. 1 (taken from [6]) we show examples for energy loss in different materials. The mini-

mum energy loss of all particles in nearly all materials occurs at 3
≤
MeV/(g/cm2) (examples: helium:
dE/dx = 1.94 MeV/(g/cm2), uranium: 1.08 MeV/(g/cm2)) with
the exception of hydrogen, in which particles experience a larger energy loss (Z/A = 1). Due to the ln γ
term the energy loss increases for relativistic particles and reaches the so-called Fermi-Plateau due to the
density effect. In gases the plateau is typically

60 % higher as the minimum.

βγ

≤

−

Due to the increased energy loss at smaller βγ, particles will deposit most of their energy at the end
of their track, just before they will be completely stopped. This “Bragg Peak” is used for the treatment
of deep-seated tumors, selecting the particle type and initial energy to optimize the energy loss close to
the tumor location, avoiding too much damage to tissue above the tumor.

2.2.2 Landau Distribution of the energy loss

The energy loss is distributed asymmetrically around the mean energy loss described by the Bethe-Bloch
formula (eq. 18); the distribution can be approximated by the Landau distribution Ω(λ)

and thin absorbers the Landau ﬂuctuations have to be considered; for example a particle with βγ = 4
in Argon experience a most probable energy loss of ( dE
dx )m.p. = 1.2 keV/cm and a mean energy loss of
dE
dx i

= 2.69 keV/cm.
For particle identiﬁcation, one has to sample often (typically 160 times or more) to measure the
Landau distribution and use adequate algorithms (e.g. “truncated mean”) to obtain the mean energy loss.

h

Examples for successful application of this particle identiﬁcation method can be found in the

literature [8, 9, 10].

2.3 Scintillation

Scintillation is the de-excitation of previously exited atoms, molecules or materials. It appears in inor-
ganic crystals, organic liquids or plastics, and gases.

In inorganic crystals, scintillation is usually an effect of the lattice. Energy lost by a passing
particle is used to produce electron-hole pairs or excitons, which de-excite at activation centers (crystal
imperfections) emitting photons. Common materials used include Thallium-doped NaI and CsI, BaF2,
and BGO (Bismuth-Germanium-Oxide).

Organic scintillators in liquids or plastic come in three components:

the primary scintillator
(antracene C14H10, naphthalene C10H8); a wavelength shifter (POPOP C24H16N2O2 1.4-Bis-[2-(5-phe-
nyloxazolyl)]-benzene, BBO C27H19NO 2.5-di-(4-biphenyl)-oxazole) and a base material like mineral
oil or PMMA (C5H8O2 polymethylmetacralate).

In gases, the atoms or molecules previously excited or ionized by dE/dx emit photons due to
recombination or de-excitation. This is often a background and noise source when using effects for
measurements, for example Cherenkov. Basically all gases (Xe, Kr, Ar, N2) exhibit this behavior.

The light yield (number of photons N ) is a non-linear function of the energy and shows a saturation

behavior, usually described by Birk’s formula

N = N0

0.01 g/MeV cm2 is the so-called Birk’s density Parameter. Recently some better approxi-

Typically about 100 eV energy loss are necessary to produce one photon. The addition of wave-

length shifters is necessary to avoid self-absorption of the produced photons.

2.4 Cherenkov Radiation

A charged particle with a velocity v larger than the velocity of light in a medium emits light [12]. The
threshold velocity vthres is given by

Water Cherenkov counters were originally developed to set limits on the lifetime of protons, but
got converted for (solar) neutrino detection. On example is (Super-)Kamiokande. Cherenkov effect in
water is also used in the tanks of the Auger Experiment to detect muons produced in cosmic ray air
showers.

The simplest Cherenkov devices are threshold Cherenkov counter, only using the difference be-
tween no light or light to set ranges for the velocity of particles. A recent example is the Belle Detec-
tor [14].

Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors not only use the threshold information, but actually measure
with the help of some imaging system (see also section 16.2) the Cherenkov angle, obtaining the velocity
of the particle. A recent example for this is the SELEX RICH [15], were we show the dependency of the
ring radius (or the Cherenkov angle) on the particle momenta.

2.5 Transition Radiation

Transition radiation is emitted due to the reformation of the particle ﬁeld while traveling from a medium
with dielectric constant ǫ1 to a medium with ǫ2. The energy of the radiation emitted at a single interface

2.7 Direct Electron Pair Production

In the Coulomb ﬁeld of a nucleus electron pairs can be produced directly via virtual photons. The
corresponding energy loss is
E for large Energies, the same behavior as in the case of Bremsstrahlung
and nuclear interactions (see sections 3.). The range of muons in rock is heavily inﬂuenced by this
interaction, and yields 140 m (Eµ = 100 GeV), 800 m (Eµ = 1 TeV), and 2300 m (Eµ = 10 TeV).
For this reason experiments requiring low backgrounds have to be performed in deep (gold-)mines to be
shielded from atmospheric muons produced by cosmic rays.

comparing with table 1 one can conclude that for most material λI , λa > X0.

4.1.1 Photoelectric Effect

tive ion. The released electron comes predominantly from the K-shell. The effect presents a complicated

5. Electromagnetic Cascades

As mentioned in section 2.6, for high electron energies the most probable process is Bremsstrahlung
(eq. 28), e.g. the generation of a real photon. For high photon energies, the most probable process is
pair creation (section 4.1.3, eq. 32). We can understand the basic features of the two processes playing
ping-pong with a simple toy model. In every step t, which corresponds to one conversion, where the step
size is related to the Radiation length X0 (eq. 29), the number of particles N is doubled (N (t) = 2t) and
2−t). The multiplication stops at tmax, where the
the energy E of each particle is halved (E(t) = E0 ·
2−tmax, which we can associate to the pair
energy of the particle falls below a critical energy Ec = E0 ·
production threshold. For the position of the shower maximum we obtain

6. Hadron Showers

The longitudinal development of hadron showers is governed by the nuclear interaction length λI (see
section 3.), and the lateral development by the transverse momentum pT of secondary particles. Since
λI > X0 and the average pT from nuclear interactions is much larger than the average pT from multiple
scattering (eq. 7), hadron showers are wider and longer than electromagnetic showers of the same original
energy.

Due to the multitude of possible processes during the shower creation, the hadron energy is trans-
ferred into several groups, each of them with their own systematic energy dependencies, and the distri-
bution into the groups is subject to ﬂuctuations. Part of the energy goes into charged particles, and if
they are µ’s, some of the energy is lost (or better: not detected). π0’s produced in the shower initiate an
electromagnetic cascade, which is usually contained. Nuclear binding energy can be partially recovered
by ﬁssion, but the energy in nuclear fragments will be partially lost. In general, the visible energy is
systematically lower than the original particle energy, and due to the ﬂuctuations in the losses the energy
resolution of hadron calorimeters is worse than for electromagnetic calorimeters.

One important point to optimize the energy resolution is to balance the different responses to

electrons and hadrons (e/π = 1, compensation). We will discuss this again in the section 11.2.

7. Drift and Diffusion in Gases

In this section we will discuss effects after particle lost it’s energy and ionized the atoms or molecules of
a gas.

The electrons and ions lose their energy by multiple elastic and inelastic collisions with the other
atoms and molecules of the gas, and will shortly reach thermal equilibrium. The ionization cloud will

With an additional electric ﬁeld, the cloud will drift with a constant velocity vdrift, which depends
on the gas and the strength of the electrical ﬁeld, but is usually measured in cm/µsec (example: argon-
isobutane: velectron
5 cm/µsec). The longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefﬁcients are different,

With an additional magnetic ﬁeld, the drift will be under an angle due to the additional (velocity

dependent) Lorentz force.

Part II: Basic Design of Detectors

In this part we will apply some of the physics discussed in the ﬁrst part to examples of particle
detectors. We will discuss wire chambers in several incarnations, which are usually used to measure the
position of particles, and electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, which are used (as already indicated
by their name) to measure the total energy. In the third part we discuss speciﬁc detectors used to identify
particles.

It is important to note that in general it is not possible to classify one detector type into one speciﬁc

group; overlaps are common and useful so one detector can perform more than one speciﬁc task.

8. Wire Chambers

8.1

Ionization Chamber

This is the simplest gas detector, but also can be build with liquid or solid materials. It is basically a large
capacitor, either ﬂat or with cylindrical symmetry (a can with a wire in the center), where the ionization
(electrons and ions) drift to anode and cathode resp. The moving charges can be collected, ampliﬁed and
integrated over time, which will give a signal which is proportional to the original ionization loss.

8.2 Proportional Counters

This detector is usually build as a cylinder like an ionization chamber, but with a smaller diameter wire
in the center or operated at a higher voltage (or both). Due to the higher ﬁeld close to the surface of the
wire, the electrons gain enough energy so they are able to ionize more of the counting gas molecules
and produce an avalanche. This charge multiplication results in a higher induced current in the wire.
The word proportional in the name stems from the fact that at not too high operating voltages the gas
ampliﬁcation is constant and the measured signal is proportional to the primary ionization.

8.3 Geiger-M ¨uller Counter

This detector is build in the same geometry as the Proportional Counter, but operated at an even higher
voltage. In the gas multiplication avalanche, in addition to ions also excited atoms and molecules are
produced, where some of them de-excite via the emission of a photon. This leads to a copious production
of photons, which can ionize more via the photoelectric effect (see section 4.1.1), also far away from the
original avalanche.

Two possibilities are used to stop discharge. One is to make the resistor between the high voltage
supply and the counter big enough, so every time the counter draws a lot of current, the voltage will drop.
The other is to add alcohols, like methylal or ethyl-alcohol, or hydrocarbons, like methane, ethane, or
isobutane, to the counting gas (usually argon); they will absorb the UV photons and reduce the free path
for them.

8.4 Gas Multiplication

As seen in the previous sections, the same detector can be operated in different modes, and each of
them carries its own name. At very low voltages (or electric ﬁelds), the ions and electrons will just
recombine. At low voltages, the two charges are separated and we operate a ionization chamber. For
medium voltage, we have constant gas ampliﬁcation and are operating a proportional counter, and a high
voltages, we operate in the Geiger-Mode. At very high voltage we will experience glow discharge, which
can destroy the detector.

8.5 Multiwire Proportional Chambers

At the beginning of the 1960’s, George Charpak (Nobel Price 1992) and others started to build detectors
containing more than one counting wire, extending signiﬁcantly the use of this kind of detectors. The
advantage to the previously used bubble chambers is obvious: The signal is electric, so it can can easily
be fed into electronics, which also started to be developed around that time.

12

Fig. 3: Left: Side view of a Multiwire Proportional Chamber. Right: Electric ﬁeld lines in a MWPC.

Over a (usually rectangular) frame, several wires are stretch in parallel. A cathode foil above and
below the wire plane completes the detector. Typical dimensions are: wire distance d a few mm (smallest
known to me 0.8 mm), wire diameter 10 µm
30 µm, thickness of chamber L a few wire distances, and
total sizes up to square meters. The total size is limited by the wire tension and electrostatic repulsion.

−

The electric ﬁeld lines form automatically cells, the electrons from ionization drift to the closest
wire. The readout electronics consists of a simple discriminator sending a logical output whenever a
particle passed close to that wire. The spatial resolution is σ = d/√12, but only in one dimension.
A second, identical module, mounted under an angle, has to be used for the other dimension. Some
detectors also use segmented cathodes for that.

8.6 Planar Drift Chambers

As mentioned above, wire chambers are limited by the electrostatic repulsion between wires, which
requires a minimum distance as well as strong frames to stand the forces. At the middle of the 1960’s,
Heintze and Walenta [16], but also others, came up with a new idea: Keep the basic geometry of a
MWPC, but make the wires further apart, and use the drift time of the electrons to the wire as additional
information. As described in section 7., in an homogeneous electric ﬁeld the drift velocity is constant. A
start signal for measuring the drift time is usually readily available in an experiment, for example from a
plastic scintillator (section 2.3) deﬁning the incoming beam.

Drift distances over several centimeters can be easily achieved, and the resolution is limited by
diffusion; In small chambers, σ > 20 µm, in larger (square meter) chambers a few 100 µm can be
obtained.

8.7 Cylindrical Drift Chambers / Jet Chambers

The same idea as in the planar drift chambers can be realized in a cylindrical geometry, more adapted
to collider detectors. The wire will be (nearly) parallel to the beam pipe, and a magnet ﬁeld parallel to
the beam (so it will not disturb it) will curve the charged particles in a plane perpendicular to the beam
direction, allowing the determination of the momentum and charge of the particles. Wires are arranged
radially to the outside, and the detector looks like composed of pieces of pie in the r-φ view. The largest

13

chamber of this type is the Central Jet Chamber of the OPAL detector at LEP, with a radius of nearly
2 meters, and a length of 4 meters, containing about 3500 counting wires [10].

8.8 Time Projection Chamber

TPCs are another device which uses in a clever way drifting electrons in a gas counter. A big usually
cylindrical volume (meters in diameter, meters in length) has a (thin) positive high voltage electrode in
the center plane, forcing electrons to drift toward the end plates of the cylinder. To reduce the longitudinal
diffusion of the electrons, a magnet ﬁeld is in parallel with the electrical ﬁeld, so electrons can only spiral
around the magnet ﬁeld lines. The end plates are equipped with wires and a segmented cathode plan
taking a two-dimensional image of the arriving electrons; the third coordinate is obtained by measuring
the drift time.

This detector was successfully used in the ALEPH experiment at LEP, but also is used in Heavy
Ion experiments with extremely high track density, like in STAR at RHIC and, in preparation, for ALICE
at LHC.

9. Solid State Tracking Detectors

9.1 Silicon Strip Detectors

In the 1980’s, silicon microstrip detectors became used heavily in HEP. They are absolutely necessary
to measure properties of particles containing charm and beauty quarks. Examples for very successful
experiments using this kind of detectors include E691 at Fermilab, WA82 at CERN, and, in colliders,
CDF, the 4 LEP experiments (Aleph, DELPHI, L3, OPAL), and the HERA experiments. Today there are
a lot of experiments using silicon microstrips, with channel counts up to 1 million or more.

The detector allows to measure with a precision of down to a few µm the one-dimensional position
of a passing charged track. Newer devices, the so-called pixel detectors, measure a two-dimensional
position. The detector uses as basic detection device a pn-junction, shown in ﬁg. 4 left, a diode which is

there are no free electron-hole pairs (also called charge carriers). In one device several (thousands) of
these pn-junctions are operated, arranged in parallel strips. Should a charged particle pass through the
detector (see ﬁg. 4 right), new electron-hole pair are created and one of the carrier types will drift toward

the nearest strip. In Silicon, the energy loss dE/dx
electron-hole pair is 3.6 eV1, so in a typically 300 µm thick detector about 3

3.8 MeV/cm, and the energy needed to create one
104 pairs will be created.
The construction of the detector itself seems to be under control today. There are several compa-
nies available which will produce the silicon detector with a well understood process. The smallest strip
distance used today is 10 µm, so that the structure is actually much simpler than the achieved sub-micron
structures in todays computer chips. The real challenge in these detectors is the readout: Imagine a
5 cm
5 cm detector with 10 µm strip distance: 5000 strips with their small signals have to be read out.
Every single strip needs a preampliﬁer, and some kind of signal detection like a discriminator, otherwise
noise will overwhelm the data acquisition. To reduce the number of cables (anyway, how to have a cable
every 10 µm?) it would be nice to chain several channels together, at best even all 5000. The chips should
then be clever enough only to send a strip number to the data acquisition, e.g. the signal gets digitized
and zero suppressed already at the detector.

×

·

A system like this, called SVX [18], was developed about 10 years ago by LBL for collider ex-
periments (CDF), and also used in WA89 [19] and SELEX [17, 20]. Never version are at use now in
D0 (SVXII) and CDF (SVXIII).

The layout of a typical ﬁxed target vertex detector is shown in ﬁg. 5. Tracks originating from the
targets are traversing the silicon planes oriented in 4 different orientations (rotated by 45◦) to allow the
reconstruction of tracks in space. They eventually get ﬁt to form a vertex, and the obtained resolution is
shown in ﬁg. 5 (right). At high momentum the resolution is limited by the strip distance, but at lower
momentum multiple scattering becomes more and more important. Nevertheless, the ﬁt takes all error
contributions correctly into account, as seen from a constant χ2 = 1 for all momenta. There is a lesson
to learn: more detectors is not always good.

9.2 Other Silicon Detectors

Other silicon detectors work on the same basic principles. Double-Sided strip detectors have a second
strip structure on the back side of the silicon waver, with additional dotations to achieve the diode struc-
ture. The strips are usually, but not always, under 90◦. The readout is more complicated, two orthogonal
sides have to have readout contacts, and in general double sided silicon is noisier and more difﬁcult to
operate. The signal is still not a real 3d information, pattern recognition algorithms have to be used to
assign hits in a multi-track environment. The main advantage is the reduction of multiple scattering,

1The band gap in Silicon is only 1.1 eV, but Silicon is an indirect semiconductor.

15

since one waver can be used to measure two projections.

Silicon Drift detectors follow the same idea as wire drift chambers: use the time information to

reduce the number of readout channels. This kind of detector will be used in the ALICE detector [21].

Silicon Pixel Detectors have, as says the name, no strips, but usually rectangular pixels, and give
real 3d information of the passing tracks. The bonding process for the readout electronics is very com-
plicated, but doable, as the prototypes for the BTeV experiment show [22]. The real 3d information is a
key ingredient for the information to be used in the trigger.

10. Photomultipliers

Photomultipliers convert light (photons) via the photoelectric effect (see section 4.1.1) to an electrical
signal. The original photo-electrons (in the most extreme case only one) is multiplied by accelerating the
electron(s) in an electric ﬁeld, hitting a metallic surface and thereby releasing more electrons, in several
stages; multiplication factors of 105 or more can be obtained.

The efﬁciency to detect a photon depends on its wavelength and on the photo-cathode material,
and has a typical maximum of up to 25%. The photo-cathode material has to be adopted to the emission

Phototubes are distinguished by their diameter (available from 3/8 inch to

40 cm), and the num-
ber of multiplication stages (between 5 and 15). The entrance window can be on top (“head on”) or on
sides (“side on”). Good summaries about photomultiplier properties can be found in [23, 24].

11. Energy Measurement: Calorimeters

The shower of an electromagnetic or hadronic cascade has to be totally absorbed. If not, the resolution
will be reduced due to ﬂuctuations in the leakage. For electrons and photons (section 5.) the sizes needed
are governed by the Radiation Length X0 (eq. 29), while for hadrons (section 6.) they are governed
by the Interaction Length λI. Different optimizations have to be adopted for electrons/photons and
hadrons. In addition, for a hadron calorimeter we have to take into account the electromagnetic part of
the showers due to π0’s, which requires the concept of “compensation” [4]. A linear dependence on the

16

original particle energy of the output signal can usually be achieved. The relative energy resolution is
σ(E)/E

1/√E, while the shower maximum is a logarithmic function of the energy.

∝

11.1 Electromagnetic Calorimeters

We can distinguish two basic designs: A sampling calorimeter, which we will discuss in more detail in
section 11.2, and a homogeneous calorimeter. The latter comes in two groups: one using the scintillation
properties of matter (section 2.3), for example CsI crystals, and one measuring the amount of Cherenkov
light (section 2.4) produced in a dense but transparent material like lead-glass. The lateral segmentation
is about one Moliere Radius RM (eq. 38), and the depth has to be sufﬁcient to contain the full shower.
Each block of material has a photomultiplier attached at the end; in the case of the ionization loss mea-
surements, ionization chambers are immersed into the liquids. Successful Calorimeters include WA89
Lead-class calorimeter [25], the KTeV CsI calorimeter [26], and the BGO Calorimeter of L3 [27].

11.2 Sampling Calorimeters

A sampling calorimeter has 2 parts: Something “heavy”, inactive, like lead, uranium, iron (steel), and
something “light”, active, like plastic scintillator (section 2.3), wire chamber (section 8.5), liquid (ioniza-
tion chamber). The two materials are either put together is an alternating multilayer sandwich or mixed
together, like lead or iron tiles with scintillating ﬁber readout.

The main design choices is how to use the thicknesses, relative and absolute, of the two materials.
Problems to consider are: The inactive part absorbs some of the produced shower particles, and the
absorption fraction is different for hadrons and electrons; some part of the hadronic response is lost due
to neutron absorption; all hadronic showers have an electromagnetic component due to the π0’s produced
in the cascades, and the obtained responses e.g. the physics effects, are different.

The electromagnetic part was understood long time ago and good simulation software (EGS) was
and is available as part of the GEANT (see section 13.) package. Only in the 1980’s, ﬁrst systematic
studies for hadronic responses were performed. The ﬁrst tries led to a Uranium / Scintillator sandwich
calorimeter, of which a ﬁrst prototype had a surprisingly (for that time) good resolution. The only partly
correct explanation brought up was that ﬁssion gives back some of “lost” neutron energy. As was found
out later, the ﬁrst prototype was “compensated” by accident.

In the mid-1980’s, systematic studies on hadronic shower proﬁles and absorptions were started
by Wigmans et al. A good account of this history is the book by Wigmans [4]. The results of these
studies was that any material combination can be tuned to give identical responses to electrons and
hadrons (“compensate”), due to the different dependencies on Z of the physics processes involved. The
best resolution for hadrons can only be achieved if the calorimeter is compensated. This understanding
100 %/√E
helped to improve the resolution for hadronic showers, which was before typicallyσE /E
to the best achieved values of 30

35 %/√E.

12. Some words about Electronics

Electric signals from detectors are small and fast. This requires high frequency, high bandwidth, low
noise electronics, which are not totally compatible requirement to easily design the electronics. In ad-
C 2. All noise sources (shot noise
dition, the detector capacitance is usually big, and noise is often
(leakage current), thermal noise, 1/f noise) have to be analyzed with great care. Stray capacitances and
100 MHz) and have to be taken
inductances on printed circuits are signiﬁcant at high frequencies (
into account during the layout of a board, as well as the ﬁnite signal speed (
5 cm/nsec). All these
problems indicated here require a much more detailed study as can be provided here. A ﬁrst start for
further reading is the electronics section of the Particle Data Book [6].

13. Some words about Simulation

Detectors are complex, complicated and expensive to build. Within one sub-detector and different sub-
detectors of an experiment interferences, which seem to be mostly destructive, are possible. Long before
building even prototypes, simulations of parts or full behavior and responses of sub-detectors or full
detectors is absolutely necessary. The software tool used for these tasks is GEANT [28]. This software
package includes models all interactions of all particles, which can selectively be switch on or off. The
distribution of material is given as a start, and GEANT is doing everything else. The original versions
were written in FORTRAN, the preferred language of particle physicists. The documentation is exten-
sive, and also can serve as a summary of the modeling of physics processes. Unfortunately, for complex
geometries simulating can be very slow, and it is often necessary to parametrize the response of detectors.

18

Part III: Particle Identiﬁcation

Here we will discuss as an example for the application of the detectors described up to now, the
identiﬁcation of particles. We will discuss in more detail transition radiation detectors and Cherenkov
detectors.

To identify neutral particles, we can only measure their total energy and, if no charged track is
pointing to the signal in the calorimeter, conclude that this was a neutral particle. Usually not too many
possibilities are left; for example in a hadron calorimeter, the only choices are neutrons or K 0

L’s.

In an electromagnetic calorimeter, one can measure in addition “E/p”, e.g. the deposited energy
If E/p = 1 we have a (relativistic)

over the previously measured momentum of a charge particle.
electrons, E/p < 1 for hadrons, and if E/p is compatible with minimum ionization, we have a muon.

Long-lived neutral particles like the hyperons Λ0 and Ξ0, and short lived (but still weakly de-
caying) particles (τ , charm, beauty), we have to measure the 4-vector of all decay products to be able
calculate the invariant mass of the ﬁnal state.

The second major applications is the identiﬁcation of beam particles for Fixed Target experiments.
In both cases, the momentum of the particle is known, in the case of neutral particles by guessing, for
charged particles by direct measurement in the beam line or by a magnetic spectrometer. With this
in mind, particle identiﬁcation reduces to measure some additional quantity, like to total energy with
a calorimeter, or some velocity (β) dependent effect like time-of-ﬂight (section 14.), dE/dx (eq. 18),
Cherenkov (section 2.4) or Transition Radiation (eq. 26).

14. Time–of–ﬂight (TOF)

This is the simplest method for identifying particles: Put two scintillation (or gas) counters at a known
distance and measure the time difference between the two signals. Time resolutions of about 150 psec can
10 m for measuring
be achieved, and with the maximum distance possible between the two detectors (
decay products,
100 m in a beam line) kaons and pions can be separated up to a few GeV/c. At higher
rate and/or more than one particles hitting the same detector elements the time difference measurement
is ambiguous and the method will not work anymore.

≈

≈

15. Transition Radiation Detectors (TRD)

The physics behind these detectors was discussed in section 2.5. The detection of Transition Radiation is
complicated by the fact that the X-rays are emitted under a small angle with respect to the particle track
(eq. 26), so in a detector the X-ray and the dE/dx signal are seen together and are of the same order
of magnitude. In addition, the dE/dx signal is Landau distributed, forcing the use of several (10
30)
radiator stacks and chamber (with heavy gases like Xenon or Krypton) units to be able to distinguish the
two signals[29, 30, 31, 32].

−

Some detectors exploit the fact that the ionization due to the X-ray is more point-like (photoelectric
effect), as opposed to the more equally distributed dE/dx signal. The Charge Integration method mea-
sures the total charge of the ionization in every unit, and counts how many chambers saw a total charge
larger than some given threshold. The Cluster Counting method employs the different spatial ionization
distribution of the two source (point for X-ray, line for dE/dx) to separate them. The obtained signals
(either clusters or charge) are compared with a likelihood method to differentiate particle hypothesis,
with known momentum. The most probable hypothesis is selected as the result of the identiﬁcation.

The most extreme and sophisticated usage of TRD technology is planned for the ATLAS exper-
iment at the LHC. They will use more than 370,000 straw tubes as transition radiation detector and in
addition use the obtained information for tracking [33].

19

16. Cherenkov Detectors

16.1 Threshold Cherenkov Detectors

With a suitable medium, which has an refractive index where one of the particles is above and the other
below the threshold (eq. 22) to produce Cherenkov light, these detectors are used in ﬁxed target beam
lines to separate two particles with the same (ﬁxed) momenta.

For the identiﬁcation of decay products over a wider momentum range, and/or if more than two
particles have to be distinguished, several counters at different thresholds have to be employed. Since
each of them is typically several meters long, in practice not more than three are used. The combination
of signals for different momentum ranges yields a decent identiﬁcation probabilities.

16.2 Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors (RICH)

Even though the basic idea of determining the velocity of charged particles via measuring the Cherenkov
angle was proposed in 1960 [34], and in 1977 a ﬁrst prototype was successfully operated [35], it was
only during the last decade that Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) Detectors were successfully used in
experiments. A very useful collection of review articles and detailed descriptions can be found in the
proceedings of four international workshops on this type of detectors, which were held in 1993 (Bari,
Italy) [36], 1995 (Uppsala, Sweden) [37], 1998 (Ein Gedi, Israel) [38], and 2002 (Pylos, Greece) [39],
respectively. In 2004 the workshop will be held in Mexico [40].

By measuring the Cherenkov angle θ one can in principle determine the velocity of the particle,
which will, together with the momentum p obtained via a magnetic spectrometer, lead to the determina-
tion of the mass and therefore to the identiﬁcation of the particle.

Neglecting multiple scattering and energy loss in the medium, all the Cherenkov light (in one
plane) is parallel, and can therefore be focused (for small θ) with a spherical mirror (radius R) onto a
point. Since the emission is symmetrical in the azimuthal angle around the particle trajectory, this leads
to a ring of radius r in the focus, which is itself a sphere with radius R/2. The radius r is given by

16.2.1 A Short History of RICHes

After the ﬁrst successful laboratory tests in the 1970’s [35], at the beginning of the 1980’s the ﬁrst
generation of Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors were built, with mixed results. Examples are the
CERN Omega RICH, used by WA69 and WA82 [42], the UA2 RICH at CERN, and the E653 RICH at
Fermilab.

A second generation RICH detectors were developed and employed at the end of the 80’s and
beginning of the 90’s, with the positive and negative experiences from the ﬁrst generation incorporated.
Examples are an upgraded Omega RICH, used by WA89 and WA94 [42], Delphi, CERES (all at CERN),
and the SLD–GRID at SLAC. All these detectors had signiﬁcant startup problems to overcome, but
eventually they all worked very well and contributed to the physics analysis of the experiments.

The third generation, build and used mid-end 90’s, ﬁnally worked without too many problems
from the beginning and all of them played an important role in the physics analysis. Examples are the
SELEX RICH at Fermilab, and Hermes and Hera-B at DESY.

Since the mid-90’s, the RICHes are an established detector type, and are currently employed in
recent experiments: BaBar–DIRC (SLAC), PHENIX and STAR (Brookhaven-RHIC), CLEO–III (Cor-
nell), COMPASS (CERN).

There is a long list of future experiments, who plan to or are already building RICHes: ALICE,
LHCB (CERN), BTeV, CKM (Fermilab), and many more. Also in other ﬁelds like nuclear physics (GSI)

20

and in astroparticle physics experiments technology developed for RICHes is used.

16.2.2 General Details for RICHes

∝

λ−2 (eq. 25), most of the light is emitted in the VUV range. To
Since the number of photons is
fulﬁll equation 23, the refractive index has to be n > 1, so there will be no Cherenkov radiation in the
x-ray region. Also it is very important to remember that n is a function of the wavelength (n = n(λ),
.
chromatic dispersion) and most materials have an absorption line in the VUV region, where n
→ ∞
Since usually the wavelength of the emitted photon is not measured, this leads to a smearing of the
measured ring radius, and one has to match carefully the wavelength ranges which one wishes to use:
Lower wavelengths gives more photons, but larger chromatic dispersion.

A very useful formula is obtained by integrating eq. 25 over λ (or E), taking into account all

efﬁciencies etc., obtaining a formula for the number of detected photons Nph [35]:

Nph = N0L sin2 θ

(40)

where N0 is an overall performance measure (quality factor) of the detector, containing all the details
(sensitive wavelength range, efﬁciencies), and L is the path length of the particle within the radiator. A “
very good” RICH detector has N0 = 100 cm−1, which gives typically around 10 to 15 detected photons
(Nph) per β = 1 ring.

The usual construction of a RICH detector is to use a radiator length of L = R/2, e.g. the path
length is equal to the focal length; but any other conﬁgurations, like folding the light path with additional
(ﬂat) mirrors, are possible.

All the presented arguments only work for small θ, which is always fulﬁlled in gases, since n only
differs little from 1. Also important is the fact, that, should the particles not pass through the common
center of curvature of mirror(s) and focal spheres, the ring gets deformed to an ellipse or, in more extreme
cases, to a hyperbola. If the photon detector is able to resolve this, and the resolution is needed for the
measurement, these deviations from a perfect circle have to be taken into account in determining the
velocity β. In general this effect can be neglected, and all parallel particles (with the same β) will give
the same ring in the focal surface, due to the fact that all emitted Cherenkov light is parallel. The position
of the ring center is determined by the angle of the tracks, not by their positions.

In the following, we will describe three RICH detectors used in experiments, and a new application

for RICH detectors for a new experiment.

16.2.3 The CERN Omega-RICH

In the middle of the 1980’s, ﬁrst attempts were made to apply the prototype results obtained by S´eguinot
and Ypsilantis [35] to experiments in a larger scale. One of these attempts was performed at the CERN
Omega facility in the West Hall. Experiments WA69 and WA82 tried to use this detector for their
analysis, but only succeeded partly. An overview about this history can be found in [42]. When in 1987 a
new experiment, later named WA89, was proposed [43, 44], an important part was a necessary upgrade of
this detector for the use by this new experiment. Two main parts where changed: New photon detectors
using TMAE as photon sensitive component, and new mirrors to perform the focusing. Details about the
detector can be found in [42, 45, 46].

The overall layout of the detector shows that RICH detectors are basically simple devices: a big
box, some mirrors at the end, and photon-sensitive detectors at the entrance. The real challenge is to
combine all the parameters together to obtain a perfect match for the overall system.

The size of the radiator box and the photon detector is given by the angular distribution of tracks
which have to be identiﬁed at the location of the detector. Since usually this detector is placed behind
a magnetic spectrometer, and the momentum spectrum of the interesting tracks depends on the physics

21

goals of the experiment, the surfaces to cover have to be determined for every setup and experiment, usu-
ally with Monte Carlo simulations during the design phase of the experiment. In the case of WA89 [45],
the mirror surface needed was about 1 m
6 m covered by the original
Omega-RICH. It was therefore decided to replace only the central mirrors with smaller, higher surface
quality mirrors to obtain better resolution.

1.5 m, much smaller than the 4 m

×

×

×

×

The detector surface was calculated to be 1.6 m

0.8 m, with a spatial resolution of a few mil-
limeters for every detected photon. The pixel size could therefore not be much bigger than also a few
millimeters, leading to about 100000 pixels in the detector plane. The solution was to build drift cham-
ber (see section 8.6) (TPC) modules, covering an area of 35 cm
80 cm, and approximating the fo-
cal sphere with a polygon of 5 modules. After passing a 3 mm thick (to minimize absorption) quartz
window, the photons are absorbed by Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-ethylen (TMAE) molecules, converting
via photo-effect (section 4.1.1) into a single electron. TMAE is present with a concentration of about
0.1 % within the driftgas, which is otherwise pure Ethan. Due to the use of a quartz window together
with TMAE as photon-sensitive gas the detector is only sensitive in a small wavelength range between
165 nm < λ < 230 nm. TMAE has a very low vapor pressure, so that at ambient temperatures the
molecules are saturated within a gas. To obtain a short enough conversion length of around 1 cm (other-
wise the conversion would occur to far away from the focal plane and lead to an additional contribution
to the resolution (parallax)), the drift gas (Ethan) is led through a bubbler, containing TMAE liquid at
30◦ C. This means that everything after the bubbler, e.g. the whole detector including radiator box, had to
be heated to 40◦ C to avoid condensation. Other unpleasant properties of TMAE include a high reactivity
with Oxygen, producing highly electro-negative oxides, which will attach an electron easily, changing
the drift velocity by a factor of several thousand, leading to a loss of electrons. Since the signal is a single
electron (photo-effect!) this is catastrophic. The counting gas had an Oxygen contents of < 1 ppm.

Mostly due to the presence of TMAE, the operation of this detector was not trivial. All parameters
were monitored electronically, and hardware limits on some critical parameters (like temperature, Oxy-
gen content of Ethan) lead to a automatic shutdown of the detector, waiting for an expert to arrive in the
experimental hall.

Once the electron was released, it was drifting under the inﬂuence of an electric ﬁeld of 1 kV/cm
(drift velocity 5.4 cm/µm) upwards or downwards over maximal 40 cm toward 6 cm long counting wires
(gold-coated tungsten, 15 µm diameter), spaced by 2.54 mm. The two-dimensional spatial information
about the conversion point of the photon is obtained with the position of the wire and the drift time of the
electron. In total, 1280 wires were used in the detector. An additional complication was that the charged
particles itself were passing through the chambers, leaving a dE/dx signal of several hundred electrons,
which is to be compared to the single electron which is our signal. This leads to increased requirements
for the wire chambers (sensitive, e.g. sufﬁcient multiplication, to single electrons, but no sparking with
several hundred electrons) and to the preampliﬁer electronic (not too much dead time after a big pulse).

The overall resolution allowed the separation of pions and kaons up to a momentum of about
100 GeV/c, which was exactly the design goal. This led to a good number of physics results (about 15
papers), which would not have been possible to obtain without the RICH detector.

16.2.4 The SELEX Phototube RICH Detector

At Fermilab a new hyperon beam experiment, called SELEX, was proposed in 1987 [48]. The key
elements to perform a successful charmed-baryon experiments are 1) a high resolution silicon vertex
detector and 2) a extremely good particle identiﬁcation system based on RICH. During the following
years, a prototype for the SELEX RICH was constructed and tested successfully [49], based in some part
on experience gained by our Russian collaborators [50]. The real detector was constructed in 1993-1996,
ready for the SELEX data taking period from July 1996 to September 1997. Details and performance
descriptions of this detector can be found in [15].

22

Fig. 7: The SELEX RICH detector. The vessel has an overall length of a little over L = 10 m, the mirrors have a radius of
R = 1982 cm, and the light tight box containing the photomultipliers is clearly seen on the left. The whole vessel is tilted by
2.4◦ to avoid that the particle trajectories go through the photomultipliers.

A photo of the detector is shown in ﬁg. 7. The radiator gas is Neon at atmospheric pressure and
room temperature, ﬁlled into the vessel with a nice gas-system [51]: First the vessel is ﬂushed for about
1 day with CO2 (a cheap gas). After this the gas (mostly CO2 and little air) is pumped in a closed system
over a cold trap running at liquid Nitrogen temperature, freezing out CO2 and the remaining water vapor.
At the same time Neon gets ﬁlled into the vessel to keep the pressure constant. This part of the procedure
takes about 1/2 day, and the vessel contains afterward only Neon and about 100 ppm of Oxygen which is
removed by pumping the gas over a ﬁlter of activated charcoal for a few hours, ending with an Oxygen
contents of < 10 ppm in the radiator. After this all valves were closed and the vessels sits there for the
whole data taking of more than 1 year at a slight (

1 psi) over-pressure.

The mirror array at the end of the vessel is made of 11 mm low expansion glass, polished to an av-
erage radius of R = (1982
5) cm, coated with Aluminum and a thin over-coating of MgF2, which gives
> 85 % reﬂectivity at 155 nm. The quality of the mirrors was measured with the Ronchi technique [52]
to assure a sufﬁcient surface quality of the mirrors. The total mirror array covers 2 m
1 m and consists
of 16 hexagonally shaped segments. The mirrors are ﬁxed with a 3-point mount consisting of a double-
differential screw and a ball bearing to a low mass honeycomb panel. The mirrors are mounted on one
sphere, and were aligned by sweeping a laser beam coming from the center of curvature over the mirrors.

The photo detector is a hexagonally closed packed 89

32 array of 2848 half-inch photomultipli-
ers. In a 3 in. thick aluminum plate holes are drilled from both sides, a 2 in. deep straight hole holds the
photomultiplier, and a conical hole on the radiator side holds aluminized Mylar Winston cones, which
form on the radiator side hexagons, leading to a total coverage of the surface. The 2848 holes are indi-
vidually sealed with small quartz windows. For the central region of the array, a mixture of Hamamatsu
R760 (ﬁg. 6) and FEU60 tubes were used, in the outside rows only FEU60 tubes are present. The nearly
9000 cables (signal, hv, ground) are routed to the bottom (hv) or top, where the signal cables are con-

23

nected to preamp-discriminator-ecl-driver hybrid chips and ﬁnally readout via standard latch modules2.
The SELEX RICH demonstrated a clear multitrack capability and low noise. To analyze an event,
the ring center is predicted via the known track parameters, and a likelihood analysis [53] for different
hypothesis (the momentum is known!) is performed to identify the particle. The ﬁnal performance of this
detector was evaluated [15]. The detector is nearly 100 % efﬁcient for protons; even below the proton
threshold the efﬁciency is above 90 %. In the SELEX ofﬂine analysis, the RICH is one of the ﬁrst cuts
applied to extract physics results.

Up to date, SELEX published 10 papers with physics results from charm and hyperon physics,

three of them in PRL.

16.2.5 DIRC at BaBar

BaBar is an experiment at SLAC, one of the so-called B-Factories, which are measuring in great detail
-violation parameters in B-Mesons. They employ a RICH detector which they call DIRC (Detection

CP
of Internally Reﬂected Cherenkov light) [54].

The radiator in this case are quartz bars, which, by internal reﬂection, transport the Cherenkov
light to one side (the other side is mirrored). A standoff box, ﬁlled with water, expands the light and
couples it to about 10,000 photomultiplier tubes. Due to the multiple internal reﬂections, the primary
images are not rings, but present a more complicated pattern. Nevertheless, by considering in addition
the arrival time of the photons at the PMTs, the Cherenkov angle can be reconstructed.

The performance of the DIRC is also very good. They reported high kaon efﬁciency and a low

miss-identiﬁcation probability. More information can be found in [55].

16.2.6 Future of RICHes with a Mexican touch: CKM

In 2001, a new experiment called CKM [56] received Stage I approval at Fermilab. The goal of the
experiment is to measure the branching ratio for K +
π+ν ¯ν to an accuracy of 10 % (SM prediction
is 10−10) to measure the CKM matrix element Vtd, contributing to test the Standard Model hypothesis
that a single phase in the CKM matrix is the sole source of
violation. To withstand the high expected
physics background, the experiment will use, in addition to a conventional magnetic spectrometer, a
velocity spectrometer consisting of two phototube RICH detectors, one to measure the incoming K +,
the second the outgoing π+ [57]. The experiment is expected to take data in the second half of this
decade.

CP

→

The expected ring radii for K + and π+ from the beam, measured in the Kaon RICH, are very well
separated, so the usual resolution question is not appropriate to ask. The real question is: how Gaussian
is the response function? The result, checked with SELEX single track data, using the standard SELEX
algorithm, is that the response function is Gaussian over nearly 5 orders of magnitude.

16.2.7 Testing Cherenkov Mirrors

The HEP group in San Luis Potos´ı, Mexico is involved in the design, construction, and testing of parts of
for the CKM RICH detectors. We will mention here especially the construction and testing of mirrors.
We apply the Ronchi method [52]. The radius of a mirror is calculated from the distance of lines from a
grating projected to the mirror surface. We are currently testing the ﬁrst prototype mirrors produced in
Mexico.

17. Summary Particle Identiﬁcation

As a summary, we show in ﬁg. 8 how to use different detectors to separate particles. Incidentally, in a
ﬁxed target experiment in a linear sense, and in a collider detector radial, this is the order of detectors the

2Since the phototubes are detecting single photons, no ADCs are necessary.

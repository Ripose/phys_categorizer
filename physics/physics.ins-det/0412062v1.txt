Abstract

Since the summer of 2003, a large Micromegas TPC prototype (1000 channels, 50 cm
drift, 50 cm diameter) has been operated in a 2T superconducting magnet at Saclay.
A description of this apparatus and ﬁrst results from cosmic ray tests are presented.
Additionnal measurements using simpler detectors with a laser source, an X-ray
gun and radio-active sources are discussed. Drift velocity and gain measurements,
electron attachment and aging studies for a Micromegas TPC are presented. In
particular, using simulations and measurements, it is shown that an Argon-CF4
mixture is optimal for operation at a future Linear Collider.

1 Introduction

The European TESLA detector and American Large Detector designs include
a large Time Projection Chamber (TPC) for the main tracking device. The
eﬃcient reconstruction of collimated jets expected at high energy e+e− col-
liders requires excellent two-track separation and full coverage of endplane
detectors using few-millimeter-width anode pads. To reduce the eﬀect of the
severe background conditions, ﬁne granularity readout and low gas sensitiv-
ity to neutrons (e.g. a Hydrogen-less mixture) are required, and the chamber
must work in a magnetic ﬁeld of 3 to 4 T. We proposed Micromegas[1] for the
ampliﬁcation stage of the TPC to meet these requirements and to provide a
natural suppression of the ion backﬂow into the drift volume [2].

The Berkeley-Orsay-Saclay cosmic-ray setup and the data taking are described
in Section 2. In Section 3, we show the Monte-Carlo simulations and experi-
mental studies which favour a new mixture for use in such a TPC. In Section
4 new developments on the expected spatial resolution are addressed.

2 The Berkeley-Orsay-Saclay cosmic ray setup

A 50 cm drift length and 50 cm diameter TPC, equipped with 1024 electronic
channels, has been in operation since July 2003, and has taken magnetic ﬁeld
data in November 2003. The anode is segmented in 8 lines with 96 pads (2
×
10 mm2), plus 2 central lines of 128 narrower pads (1
10 mm2). The pads
are drawn on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) by standard etching technics.
Each pad is read out independently through a metallised via across the PCB.
Particular care has been given to the surface quality of the PCB. To sustend
the micromesh, 50 µm high polyimide pillars, 200 micron diameter, have been
formed by etching a photoimageable ﬁlm. The large copper micromesh has
been made at the CERN workshop. The detector is ﬁtted to the bore of a
2 T superconducting magnet providing a magnetic ﬁeld, homogeneous at the
percent level in the region
25 cm each side of the center of the magnet, along
the magnet axis.

The signals are ampliﬁed, shaped and sampled at the rate of 20 MHz and
digitised over 10 bits with the STAR readout electronics. This is the largest
micropattern detector ever built. The VME-based data acquisition is triggered
at a rate of about 1 Hz by the coincidence of 2 large scintillators read out
by phototubes. The data acquisition conditions were very steady, with mesh
currents less than 0.3 nA, no sparking. The data were analysed using Java
Analysis Studio and AIDA. Data have been taken with three gas mixtures:
Ar/CH4 : 90/10, Ar/Isobutane : 95/5, Ar/CF4 : 97/3. The drift ﬁeld was 120
V/cm in the ﬁrst case and 200 V/cm in the two others. Most tracks were
cosmic muons with momentum between 300 MeV and 3 GeV, thus minimum
ionising and with relatively low multiple scattering.

Prior to building the large setup, we have checked with a small detector with
a non-segmented anode that the behaviour of Micromegas was not hampered
by a large magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the mesh. We measured the position
and the relative width of the 5.9 keV line of an iron 55 source, while varying the
magnetic ﬁeld from 0 to 2 T. They show a remarkable stability as a function
of the magnetic ﬁeld (Figure 1).

3 A magic gas mixture: Ar + CF4

Beside demonstrating the feasability and operability of a large scale Mi-
cromegas TPC, the goal of the cosmic ray data taking was to conﬁrm Mag-
boltz [3] Monte Carlo calculations of the expected performance of diﬀerent gas
mixtures. Over 50 workable mixtures of a majoritary noble gas (the “carrier”)
with an admixture (the “quencher”) of one or two molecular gases to quench
the UV photons produced during the avalanche, have been considered. Simul-
taneously requiring to have enough primary electrons, have an aﬀordable cost,
and present a velocity maximum at low enough ﬁeld – a ﬁeld of 200 V/cm
already requires a 50 kV cathode voltage for a drift length of 2.5 m – point to
Argon as a carrier gas. Most of the quenchers used until now are hydrocarbons.
However, Hydrogen nuclei, protons, are bounced by O(1 MeV) neutrons that
are expected to be produced in large numbers by the accelerator and heavily
ionise while drifting around magnetic ﬁeld lines. It is thus preferable to avoid
hydrogenated gases. CO2 gives too small drift velocities in mixtures with Ar.
In contrast, a few percent of CF4 gives velocities up to 8-9 cm/µs at a low
enough ﬁeld as shown by the curves of Figure 2.

Drift velocity. With the mixture of Ar with 3% CF4, the time between
the trigger and the arrival of the ionisation buckets on each time cluster was
determined. The time distribution presents an edge at 5350 ns with a 3%
accuracy, for a 47.9 cm drift. This leads to a drift velocity determination of

Gain. The gain has been measured as a function of the mesh voltage for
various concentrations of CF4 in Ar, with a 100 µm gap. The result is shown
in ﬁgure 3. Gains up to 105 are reached before sparking. The gain shows an
exponential behaviour until a value of 1000, due to secondary eﬀects, and grows
faster than an exponential for higher voltages. With existing or foreseeable
low-noise electronics, gains as low as 300 or 500 would suﬃce to operate the
detector, and would even be seeked to avoid the formation of space charge in
the drift volume. In the cosmic setup, data were taken at a gain of about 800.

Attachment. There exists a resonance in the attachment cross-section for an
electron kinetic energy slightly below the ionisation threshold [4]. This might
hamper the operation of a device using this gas, as the negative ions formed
are excessively slow. However, the Monte Carlo simulation predicts no attach-
ment (or a negligible attachment) in the drift region, for ﬁelds less than 400
V/cm, and also predicts that the attachment is overwhelmed by the Townsend
coeﬃcient in the ampliﬁcation region. Given the smallness (a few microns) of
the transition between the two regions, the operation of Micromegas is not
aﬀected by attachment. In the cosmic ray setup, an exponential ﬁt to the
truncated mean signal versus drift distance showed no attenuation, allowing
a lower limit at 2.4 m (90% C.L.) to be set on the attenuation length.

The dependence of the attachment coeﬃcient as a function of the electric
ﬁeld has been measured from the amplitude of a laser photoelectric signal,
in a setup with a 1.29 cm drift. The data are in excellent agreement with
Magboltz predictions (Figure 4).

Monte Carlo prediction.

Aging. Mixtures containing CF4 have often been convicted of damaging the
detectors ﬂushed with them, especially in the presence of Hydrogen atoms and
in highly ionising conditions [5]. In the past 5 years however many tests have
been carried out with Micromegas detectors with CF4 mixtures, and never
signs of degradation have been observed. A dedicated aging test has been
carried out at Saclay with an Ar plus 5% CF4 mixture, by monitoring the
mesh current during 3 days, gathering 4 mC/mm2 (over 1,000 years of linear
collider with expected background conditions!). The gain was 8000 and no
degradation was observed at the percent level. Though the aging issue would
require additionnal long-term systematical studies, there is no reason to fear
anomalous aging, in well-controlled operating conditions and with a suitable
choice of the building materials.

Transverse diﬀusion. A circle has been ﬁtted to the projection of each track
onto the plane transverse to the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Six out of the ten
pad rows (including the two with narrow pads) are used in the ﬁt, while the
r.m.s. width of the 4 leftover hits is estimated from a maximum likelihood ﬁt
to the amplitude distributions as a function of the coordinate along the pad
row. Most information comes from the hits consisting of more than 2 pads

6

(50% of the pads are such) and from tracks near the edge of a single-pad hit.
The square of the average of the r.m.s. hit widths (σ2
x) for the 1 tesla data
sample are plotted versus the drift distance in ﬁgure 5. The linear increase
of σ2
x as a function of the drift distance is characteristic of the diﬀusion. The
slope gives the transverse diﬀusion constant for Ar plus 3% CF4 at B=1 T:
16 µm/√cm where the error is dominated by systematics, at this
Dt = 64
preliminary stage of the analysis. This is in agreement with the expectation
of 86 µm. Note that the ωτ factor for this fast gas for B = 1 T is as large as 4.

4 Spatial resolution

The very low transverse diﬀusion expected for a LC-TPC operating in mag-
netic ﬁelds of 3-4 T yields a potential for a very high spatial resolution. How-
ever, there is a drawback: at a typical drift distance of 1 m, the r.m.s. width of
350 µm, much smaller than the 2 mm-wide pads
a track is expected to be
that would provide the required 2-track separation. The charge would be col-
lected by a single pad, yielding resolutions of order 600 µm, much worse than
one could expect if one could make a barycenter between 2 or 3 neighbouring
pads. Narrower pads would imply an unacceptable increase in the the number
of electronic channels. Two solutions have been proposed to this problem.

∼

One possibility is to spread the charge after ampliﬁcation, by means for in-
stance of a resistive foil [6]. This has been proven to function with GEMs and

7

s
Micromegas and to yield point resolutions of 80 µm, beyond the requirements
for the LC TPC.

300 µm2 pads equipped with
Another possibility is the digital TPC [7]: 300
a digital readout would provide the ultimate resolution and a better dE/dx
measurement. Practical demonstrations of such devices with a gas ampliﬁer
combined with silicon pixels have been presented for the ﬁrst time at this
conference [8,9]. This would require 108 channels, but all integrated and with
a binary (i.e. 1 bit) output.

5 Conclusion

A large Micromegas TPC has been operated successfully for the ﬁrst time in
a magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁrst results show that an Ar CF4 mixture is particularly
suited for operation at the linear collider. Obtaining the optimal spatial res-
olution is still a challenge, but two satisfactory solutions have been recently
demonstrated in principle. At the present stage of the R&D, the adequacy of
a Micromegas TPC for the tracking at the linear collider appears thus very
promising.

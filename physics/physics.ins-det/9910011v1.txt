Abstract

The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) is a new 1000-tonne D2O ˇCerenkov
solar neutrino detector. A high energy gamma-ray source is needed to calibrate
SNO beyond the 8B solar neutrino endpoint of 15 MeV. This paper describes the
design and construction of a source that generates 19.8-MeV gamma rays using
the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction (“pT ”), and demonstrates that the source meets all the
physical, operational and lifetime requirements for calibrating SNO. An ion source
was built into this unit to generate and to accelerate protons up to 30 keV, and a high
purity scandium tritide target with a scandium-tritium atomic ratio of 1:2.0±0.2
was included. This pT source is the ﬁrst self-contained, compact, and portable high
energy gamma-ray source (Eγ >10 MeV).

1 Introduction

The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) [1] is a new heavy water (D2O)
ˇCerenkov solar neutrino detector. The detector is unique in its use of 1000
tonnes of D2O as target, which allows the detection of electron neutrinos and
neutrinos of all active ﬂavours through the following channels:

−

νe + d → p + p + e
− 1.44 MeV
νx + d → p + n + νx − 2.22 MeV
νx + e− → νx + e−

(3)

This ability to measure the total ﬂux of all active ﬂavours of neutrinos origi-
nating from the Sun will allow SNO to make a model-independent test of the
neutrino oscillation hypothesis.

The SNO collaboration needs a high energy calibration point beyond the 8B
solar neutrino energy endpoint of ∼15 MeV. This calibration point is very
important in understanding the detector’s energy response because ˇCerenkov
light production is not exactly linear in energy (e.g. energy loss to low energy
electrons below the Cˇerenkov threshold). As the energy increases, the proba-
bility that a photomultiplier tube would get hit by more than one ˇCerenkov
photon increases. Therefore, a calibration point beyond the solar neutrino
energy endpoint will provide vital information on this multiple hit eﬀect at
energies beyond the solar neutrino endpoint.

In the arsenal of calibration sources at SNO, the “pT ” source, which employs
the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction to generate 19.8-MeV gamma rays, has the highest
energy. This pT source is the ﬁrst self-contained, compact, and portable high
energy gamma-ray source (Eγ >10 MeV).

In this paper various aspects of the construction and operation of the pT source
are described. In Section 2 the design criteria for a high energy gamma-ray
calibration source at SNO are outlined. Attributes of the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction

are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, the design of the pT source is de-
scribed. Details involving the fabrication of the scandium tritide target and
the assembly of the pT source are summarized in Section 5. The experimental
setups used in measuring the neutron and the gamma-ray output of the pT
source are described in Section 6. The results of these measurements can be
found in Section 7, followed by the conclusions in Section 8.

2 Design Criteria for a High Energy Gamma-Ray Source

One way to calibrate the high-energy response (10< E <20 MeV) of a large
water ˇCerenkov detector like SNO is to use high-energy gamma rays generated
from radiative-capture reactions in an ion source. The devices that provide
these high-energy gamma rays must be compact enough to be maneuvered to
diﬀerent regions in the D2O volume using the SNO calibration source manip-
ulator system. The largest insertion port for calibration devices at SNO can
accommodate devices up to about 30 cm in diameter and 75 cm in length.
This physical constraint limits the actual size of such calibration devices.

Because the SNO detector is essentially a 100% eﬃcient, 4π detector to gamma
rays, one does not need to design a high-energy source with a high gamma-ray
production rate. The centroid of the photopeak can be measured to better
than 1% in less than an hour with a gamma-ray yield of 0.2 s−1.

SNO is designed to run with MgCl2 loaded in the heavy water to detect the
free neutron in Reaction (2). The high energy gamma-ray source is required to
have a low neutron production rate. This will minimize the signal interference
of the gamma rays resulting from thermal neutron capture by 35Cl in D2O in
the “salt” running scenario and the dead time in the data acquisition system.
A neutron production of less than 104 s−1 is needed for the design goal of
>0.2 γ s−1.

The pT source must be available to calibrate the SNO detector whenever there
is a change to the detector conﬁguration, or when a high energy calibration is
called for. An operational lifetime of >60 hours for the pT source will be more
than enough to calibrate the SNO detector during its anticipated life span.

Electromagnetic interference between this high energy calibration source and
the photomultiplier tube array must be minimal. For this reason, accelerator
sources like the pT source have to be run in direct current mode, instead of
pulsed mode, to eliminate possible electromagnetic pickup by the photomul-
tiplier tube array.

3 Attributes of a 3H(p,γ)4He Source

The 3H(p,γ)4He reaction has a Q-value of 19.8 MeV. Since 4He does not have a
bound excited state, the gamma ray emitted in this reaction is monoenergetic.
Building a compact gamma-ray calibration source using this reaction is an
attractive proposal for several reasons.

First of all, the projectile and the target have unit charge. Therefore, the
eﬀect of Coulomb suppression on the cross section for this reaction is less
than reactions with other combinations of incoming charged projectiles and
targets. Hence, the beam energy and power can be minimised. This allows the
beam to be run in a d.c. mode without incorporating a complicated cooling
system for the target.

As the Q-value of 3H(p,n)3He is -0.763 MeV, the pT source is essentially
neutron-free if the proton energy is below this threshold. However, isotopic
impurities and the isotopic exchange between the beam and the target will
give rise to undesirable neutrons through the 2H(t,n)4He, 3H(d,n)4He, and
3H(t,nn)4He reactions. In principle, one can eliminate this neutron production
problem by mass analyzing the beam. However, this option is not possible in
the pT source given the physical size constraint mentioned in the last section.

A monoenergetic calibration source like the pT source is better than sources
with multiple energy lines in calibrating water ˇCerenkov detectors which gen-
erally have poor energy resolution.

4 Design of the pT Source

In order to keep the system as clean as possible, the pT source was built
with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) hardware. A cross sectional drawing of the pT
source can be found in Figures 1. The source can essentially be divided into
three sections: the gas-discharge line, the ion acceleration line and the target
chamber. In the following, the design of these three sections is discussed.

The gas-discharge line is a cold-cathode Penning ion source, which runs in d.c.
mode with a very modest power consumption. The outer housing of the gas-
discharge line consists of two glass-to-stainless-steel adapters 5 . Each of these
adapters is 7.62 cm in length with a piece of 1.27-cm long Pyrex glass to isolate
the two ends. The electrodes E1, E2 and E3 are welded to these adapters. The
use of these glass-to-stainless-steel adapters provides convenient high voltage
isolation between the anode and the cathodes. The placement of the various

5 Manufactured by Larson Electronic Glass, Redwood City, CA, USA

electrodes in the gas-discharge line was designed using the simulation program
MacSimion [3]. In the design, eﬀorts were made to minimise ion loss to the
electrode walls; hence, a higher beam current can be attained for a given
discharge current. The beam was spread over the target; this reduces the areal
power density and improves the target’s longevity. Under the normal running
scenario, the cathodes (E1 and E3) are kept at ground, whilst the anode (E2)
is maintained at +2 kV d.c.

A SAES St-172 getter (model LHI/4-7/200) is used as the hydrogen dis-
charge gas reservoir for the ion source. The getter has 360 mg of a zirconium-
vanadium-iron alloy active material, and is mounted to the BNC connector
next to E1 in Figure 1.

The axial magnetic ﬁeld required in the discharge is provided by a cylindrical
magnet composed of seven 13.34 cm (outer diameter) by 5.88 cm (inner diam-
eter) by 1.91 cm (thick) barium ferrite feroxdur ceramic rings. The maximum
magnetic ﬁeld inside the central bore of the magnet is about 0.06 T.

The ion acceleration line is a double-ended glass adapter 6 , with one end at-
tached to the gas-discharge line and the other connected to the target chamber
which is biased at a negative high voltage. In this scheme, the construction
of complicated accelerating and focusing electrodes is avoided, and the length
can also be kept to a minimum. When the ions exit this acceleration line and
enter the target chamber, they have acquired an energy equivalent to the tar-
get bias voltage, in addition to their ejection energy from the ion discharge
region.

At the end of the ion acceleration line in the pT source is the target mount
ﬂange. The target is secured to a copper heat sink, as shown protruding from
the ﬂange in Figure 1, by a stainless steel screw-on cap. This mounting mech-
anism is designed to allow eﬃcient target mounting in the tritium glovebox in
which this operation is to be performed.

The total length of the pT source is only 50 cm. For deployment in SNO, it
will be housed inside a 25.4-cm diameter by 60-cm long stainless steel cylin-
drical deployment capsule. The dimensions of this capsule are well within the
physical limits imposed by the SNO calibration-source-deployment hardware.

The expected yield of the pT source was calculated. Because the cross section
of the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction below 50 keV is not well known, the cross section
at the operating voltage of the pT source had to be extrapolated from existing
data. Details of this extrapolation can be found in [4]. The stopping power
required in the yield calculation was calculated using the program SRIM [5].

ber DEG-150).

Figure 2 shows the estimated gamma-ray yield as a function of the the mass-1
content in a 50-µA, 27-keV beam in the constructed pT source. This calcula-
tion assumed a total mixing of hydrogen isotopes between the beam and the
target.

The ion beam current was measured in situ by a calorimetric method and
by a Faraday cup ﬁtted with a secondary electron suppression scheme. These
measurements were made with extra hardware installed in the target chamber
of an untritiated model pT source. Beam current measured by both methods
agreed with each other. The pT source is capable of generating at least 50µA
of total (atomic and molecular) beam current at a beam energy of 20 keV.
The mass composition of the beam was also measured in situ by lengthen-
ing the target chamber and installing a home-built mass spectrometer in the
model source. The mass-1 composition was determined to be (0.63±0.09) in
the H2 partial pressure range of 0.3×10−3 to 0.6×10−3 mbar, which is a factor
of ∼5 lower than the normal operating pressure of the pT source. The normal
operating pressure of the source was chosen by considering the beam stability
and longevity running in a continuous mode. The mass composition measure-
ment could not be made at the normal operating H2 pressure of the source
due to increased beam scattering in the lengthened target chamber and the
inadequate resolution of the spectrometer.

5 Construction of the pT Source

5.1 Fabrication of the Scandium Tritide Target

Molybdenum was chosen as the substrate for the scandium ﬁlm because of
the strong adhesion between the two materials [6]. To ensure high adhesion
strength of the scandium ﬁlm to the molybdenum substrate, it was prepared
by going through a series of mechanical and chemical treatments prior to ﬁlm
deposition.

A substrate disc of diameter 2.86 cm was ﬁrst cut out from a 1-mm thick sheet
of 99.95% pure molybdenum using the electro-discharge machining (EDM)
technique. This was to minimise the use of machining oil on the substrate.
The substrate was then sandblasted by ﬁne glass beads in order to increase its
eﬀective surface area and enhance the ﬁlm adhesion strength. The scandium
ﬁlm would peel oﬀ much more easily from a non-roughened substrate surface.

The substrate was then treated chemically in a multi-stage process. It was
ﬁrst cleansed in acetone in an ultrasonic bath for half an hour. The substrate
was subsequently ultrasonically cleansed in ethanol, then deionised water, for

6

half an hour in each solvent. This sequence of chemical cleansing ensured that
hydrocarbons that might have deposited on the substrate during the EDM
process to be removed. The substrate surface was then etched in a 3 M nitric
acid bath for 30 seconds. The whole chemical cleansing process was completed
by a 30-minute deionised water wash in an ultrasonic bath.

Once the substrate had gone through this series of preparation processes, it
was mounted to a copper holder in which a 110-W coil heater was embedded
and placed inside the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) evaporation system which
is described below. This heater block was outﬁtted with thermocouples for
monitoring its temperature. The substrate was baked at 400◦C in the evapo-
ration system for about four days, then at 250◦C for about a week to reduce
outgassing from its surface.

Fabrication of the scandium tritide target, and the subsequent assembly of the
pT source were performed at the tritium laboratory at Ontario Hydro Tech-
nologies (OHT) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The schematic of the vacuum
system is shown in Figure 3. To ensure that a high vacuum could be achieved
in this tritium run, oil-free vacuum pumps and UHV hardware were used in
this system. The evaporation chamber is a UHV six-way cross with an outer
ﬂange diameter of 15.24 cm. The tritium-compatible glovebox is continuously
purged with dry nitrogen. The moisture level in the glovebox is typically 30 to
50 ppm by volume. The nitrogen purge gas is routed through a Zr2Fe tritium
trap in order to remove its tritium content before venting [7]. The exhaust of
the vacuum system is also routed through a Zr2Fe trap before venting.

Two high-current feedthroughs were connected to the evaporation chamber.
A 5-coil conical tungsten evaporation basket 7 was mounted between these
feedthroughs. A (26±1)-mg lump of 99.99% pure, sublimed dendritic scan-
dium was placed inside this basket, and positioned directly above the molyb-
denum substrate in the heater block. The separation between the bottom of
the tungsten basket and the molybdenum substrate was (14±2) mm. A stain-
less steel shroud was positioned around the feedthrough-basket assembly to
prevent deposition on the viewport in the evaporation chamber and to reﬂect
radiation back to the coil to enhance heating eﬃciency. This arrangement is
shown in Figure 4.

A quartz oscillator is installed at the end of an evaporator bellows as shown
in the setup in Figure 3. When the deposition assembly is inserted into the
evaporation chamber, the oscillator can be lowered to the back side of the
assembly through an aperture in the main shroud and used to monitor the
deposition rate of scandium. The distance between the scandium source (in
the tungsten evaporation basket) and the oscillator was 27 cm.

As shown in Figure 3, there are two main gas lines connected to the evapo-
ration chamber in the vacuum system of the setup. One of these branches is
connected to a 5-g depleted uranium bed. This uranium bed is used to store
tritium which can be readily desorbed by raising it to suﬃciently high tem-
perature [8,9]. In Table 1, the isotopic purity of the tritium gas in this bed is
shown.

Prior to ﬁlm evaporation, the whole apparatus was baked for over a week
at ∼150-200 ◦C to reduce the outgassing rate of the evaporation system. The
tungsten evaporation coil was also baked by running a 10 A current through it.
The base pressure of the system was ∼6×10−7 mbar during the bakeout. After
the baking, the evaporation system reached a base pressure of 5.8×10−8 mbar.

After bakeout, the deposition assembly (i.e. the high current feedthrough-
evaporation basket assembly) was delivered into the evaporation chamber by
winding in the linear translation stage to which the deposition assembly ﬂange
was connected. The tungsten evaporation basket was positioned directly above
the centre of the molybdenum substrate.

The current fed to the tungsten basket was raised at a rate of about 1 A min−1
during the ﬁrst thirty minutes of the experiment. This rate was then decreased
to 0.2 A min−1 to lower the outgassing rate of the evaporation hardware. The
basket current was raised up to 46 A, at which point the coil temperature was
∼1900 ◦C. This was to ensure that all the scandium, whose melting point is
1539 ◦C, was evaporated. The evaporated scandium ﬁlm has a thickness of
(1.1±0.3) mg cm−2.

Immediately after the scandium deposition, the deposition assembly was re-
moved from the evaporation chamber by winding out the linear translation
stage and closing a gate valve (V2 in Figure 3). Before tritium was let into
the evaporation chamber, the evaporation chamber was isolated by closing the
remaining gate valves (V1 and V3 in Figure 3) connected to it. The molyb-
denum substrate temperature was subsequently raised to 400 ◦C to enhance
tritium sorption by the scandium ﬁlm later on.

The uranium tritide bed was ﬁrst heated to 135 ◦C to drive out the 3He from
tritium decay in the bed. At this temperature, tritium is still “locked” inside
the bed. The released 3He was ﬁrst pumped out of the system before the
uranium bed temperature was raised to 220-240 ◦C at which temperature the
tritium is desorbed. In order to measure the amount of tritium sorbed by the
scandium ﬁlm, the tritium gas released from the uranium bed was ﬁrst trapped
in the small volume between valves V6 and V10 (see Figure 3) before releasing
to the isolated evaporation chamber. This trap has a volume of (31.9±2.2) cm3.
With the tritium pressure measured by the pressure transducer connected to
this volume, the amount of tritium used could then be determined. A total of

8

(8.19±0.57) Ci of tritium was injected in 13 diﬀerent doses into the chamber.

In Figure 5 the pressure inside the evaporation chamber is plotted against
the time after Doses 1, 7, 9 and 13 were injected. It is clear from the ﬁgure
that the sorbing capacity of the scandium ﬁlm decreased as the tritium con-
centration in the ﬁlm increased. By integrating the tritium absorption curves
for all the doses and correcting for the solid angle subtended by the target
in the evaporation system, the tritium activity on the target was found to be
(3.3±0.8) Ci. The 3H/Sc atomic ratio of the target is (2.0±0.2).

5.2 Assembly of the pT Source

The ion source must be cleansed before it could accept the tritiated target. If
the outgassing rate of the ion source is too high, the getter would lose most
of its capacity on pumping the residual gas in the source, rather than serving
its purpose as the hydrogen discharge gas reservoir.

The ion source was cleansed chemically and mounted to a tritium-free bakeout
system whose schematic is shown in Figure 6. The ion source was baked at
150 ◦C for about two weeks. The bakeout vacuum system was ﬂushed with
argon for approximately 5 to 10 minutes daily during this bakeout period. This
ﬂushing procedure did improve the overall cleanliness of the vacuum system.

After the target fabrication, the ion source was removed from the bakeout
system and wrapped in layers of ParaﬁlmTM which is a ﬂexible, thermoplastic
material. It was used to minimise tritiated particles depositing on the outer
surface of the ion source once it was taken into the glovebox where the target
evaporation system was set up. The tritiated target was removed from the
evaporation system and mounted to the pT source. The ion source was then
connected to the vacuum system as indicated in Figure 3.

After the system had reached its base pressure, H2 was let into the system, and
an ion beam was allowed to strike and to bombard the target for 5 minutes.
During this time, the beam energy was gradually increased from 0 to 25 keV.
This procedure was necessary to cleanse the Penning electrodes by electro-
discharge. Contamination on the target, which might have deposited on the
target surface during the target mounting process, would also be removed by
this brief beam bombardment. It was found that if this step were not carried
out, the getter in the source would not be able to handle the residual gas load
in the source once sealed.

The St-172 getter had to be activated before loading hydrogen to it. To activate
the getter, it was heated for 10 minutes at 800◦C by passing a 4.5 A current
through it. Once activated, the getter current was lowered to about 1.6 A in

9

order to maintain a temperature of 200◦C. The getter was then loaded with
hydrogen by allowing an ambient H2 pressure of 3.3×10−4 mbar into the ion
source. After 30 minutes, ∼200 cm3 mbar of H2 would have been absorbed by
the 360 mg of active material in the getter. The getter loading procedure was
completed by turning oﬀ the getter current, and by pumping out the residual
H2 gas in the ion source. After the base pressure was reached, the source
was isolated and detached from the rest of the vacuum system by closing the
metal-seal valve on the source. The source was subsequently removed from the
glove box, and its outer surface was de-contaminated.

6 Experimental Setup for Measuring the Neutron and Gamma-

Ray Yields of the pT Source

6.1 Gamma-Ray Detection Systems

After the pT source was constructed at OHT, a quality assurance test was ﬁrst
performed at Queen’s University at Kingston, ON, Canada. The source was
subsequently transported to the University of Washington for a measurement
of the gamma-ray angular distribution in the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction [4]. In the
quality assurance test, a 12.7-cm diameter by 7.6-cm long bismuth germanate
(Bi4Ge3O12, or BGO) crystal was used as the gamma-ray detector [10]. In the
angular distribution measurement, three 14.5-diameter by 17.5 cm cylindrical
barium ﬂuoride (BaF2) crystals were used. In Figures 7 and 8 the orientations
of the pT source with respect to the detectors in the two diﬀerent test systems
are shown.

In Figure 9 the energy spectrum from the quality assurance test at Queen’s is
shown with the cosmic ray background subtracted.

6.2 Neutron Detection System

Because of beam-target mixing, fast neutrons are generated through the 2H(t,n)4He,
3H(d,n)4He, and 3H(t,nn)4He reactions. The neutron output of the pT source
during its lifetime was monitored by neutron-proton elastic scattering in or-
ganic scintillators. The neutron detector was a 12.7-cm diameter by 5.1-cm
thick Bicron BC 501 liquid scintillator, which was optically coupled to a Hama-
matsu R1250 photomultiplier tube (PMT).

A Piel 112 pulse shape discriminator (PSD) [11] was used to perform pulse
shape discrimination on gammas and fast neutrons generated by the pT source.

10

The neutron-gamma separation ability in the neutron detection system is
demonstrated in Figure 10.

7 Gamma-Ray and Neutron Yields of the Source

The gamma-ray and neutron production rates by the pT source are sum-
marised in this section. The pT source was operated in the quality assurance
test as described in the last section. It was also used in a measurement to
determine the gamma-ray angular distribution in the pT reaction. During the
98.8 hours of operational lifetime of the pT source, we took data at beam
energies of 22, 27 and 29 keV.

7.1 Gamma-Ray Yields

The gamma-ray detectors were energy calibrated by a variety of sealed sources:
137Cs(0.662 MeV), 207Bi(1.063 MeV), 12C∗(4.44 MeV), and 16O∗(6.13 MeV).
Without a readily available energy source with an energy close to 19.8 MeV,
Monte Carlo simulation using GEANT [12] was relied upon to calculate the
response of the detectors. The simulation program was checked against the
data taken with a strength calibrated 13C(α,n)16O∗ source.

Energy spectra were taken with this source placed at the centre of the de-
tector system. At the time of this experiment, this source had a strength of
(4.1±0.1)×103 γ s−1. Because of its high neutron output, energy spectra were
taken with a 2.5-cm thick slab of lead placed between the source and the detec-
tors to extract the neutron induced spectra. By comparing these two types of
spectra, the gamma-ray line shape could then be extracted for each detector. In
Figure 11, the GEANT generated line shape is compared to an experimentally
determined spectrum. After correcting for the eﬀects of lead absorption, neu-
tron induced background and dead-time, the number of detected gamma rays
and eﬃciency (εexp) were extracted. The average ratio between εexp and the
GEANT calculated eﬃciency (εM C), εexp/εM C, was found to be (1.01±0.04).

The gamma-ray penetration function ηγ(θ) was measured for the 6.13-MeV
gamma-ray line in the three BaF2 detectors. This source was positioned inside
an untritiated model pT source, the mechanical construction of which was
identical to the real pT source, at the location where the tritiated target would
be mounted. The gamma-ray detection rate was then measured experimentally
in a procedure similar to the eﬃciency measurement above. By comparing
this detection rate and the one without the presence of the model source, the
average penetration factor over the solid angle subtended by the detectors

11

hηγ(θ)iΩdet was then extracted. The average percentage diﬀerence between the
measured values and the simulated ones is ∼ ±3%.

To extract the gamma-ray yield of the pT source, the calibrated “beam-on”
data were ﬁtted to a composition of a cosmic-ray background and the 19.8-
MeV line shape for an isotropic source located at the target surface in the
pT source as generated by GEANT simulation. Because the emitted gamma
rays in the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction have a predominant sin2 θ angular distribu-
tion [4,13,14], the extracted gamma-ray amplitude from the ﬁt was corrected
for this distribution.

The average gamma-ray production rate at Ep =27 keV during the quality
assurance run in the ﬁrst 20.9 hours of the source’s lifetime was found to
be (0.67±0.11) s−1. The rate at Ep =29 keV during the gamma-ray angu-
lar distribution measurement in the last 47.2 hours of the source’s lifetime
was (0.36±0.03) s−1. In Figure 12, the gamma-ray production rate was renor-
malised to that for a 29-keV atomic beam. It is clear that the gamma-ray yield
decreased over time and is due to beam-target mixing and target sputtering
in the source. This point will be discussed after evaluating the neutron yields
in the next section.

7.2 Neutron Yields

In the pT source most of the neutrons are generated through the 3H+3H in-
teraction. Although the discharge gas stored into the hydrogen reservoir in
the pT source was initially free of any tritium, tritium would get into the
discharge gas through beam-target exchange after a period of beam bombard-
ment. Moreover, deuterium present in the discharge gas (at a 1.5×10−4 level)
and in the target (at a 1.2×10−3 level) would also enhance neutron production
by the source through the 3H(d,n)4He reaction. In the following the results of
this neutron production measurement are presented.

The fast neutron detection eﬃciency of the liquid scintillator was calibrated
using an 241Am-9Be source which generates neutrons through 9Be(α,n)12C.
This source has a calibrated neutron strength of (7.1±0.7)×103 n s−1 and
was placed on the axis of the detector with a separation of 20.6 cm, the
same distance between the tritiated target and the neutron detector in the
gamma-ray angular distribution runs. Gamma rays and neutrons generated
by the source could be cleanly separated by pulse shape discrimination. The
net neutron count rate was extracted after the correction of a (7.1±0.1)%
dead time and the subtraction of a background rate of 0.7 s−1. The detection
eﬃciency (ε∆Ω/4π) was found to be (3.6 ± 0.4) × 10−3.

Neutrons generated by the pT source would inevitably be scattered or ab-

12

sorbed by its construction material. Hence the detected neutron rate (Rdet)
would be less than the actual pT -source generated rate (Rgen) by a reduction
factor ηn. To measure this reduction coeﬃcient, the 241Am-9Be source was
placed on the target mount inside the untritiated model source. This model
source was then placed in the same orientation to the liquid scintillator as in
the gamma-ray angular distribution runs. After correcting for the dead time
and background, and comparing the neutron detection rate to that in the cal-
ibration runs without the presence of this model source, it was found that the
pT source hardware absorbed or scattered (38 ± 6) % of the neutrons that are
generated inside the source.

Because there was a variation in beam intensity on target from run to run,
the neutron production rate was normalised to the current drawn from the
target bias supply in order to provide a fair comparison. This current was a
combination of the actual ion current on target and the contribution from sec-
ondary electron emission. The pT source does not have any internal secondary
electron suppression scheme because of physical constraints imposed by the
SNO calibration hardware.

Two assumptions were made in extracting this neutron generation rate by the
pT source:

(1) the neutrons generated by the pT source have the same energy spectrum

as fast neutron spectrum from the 241Am-9Be calibration source;

(2) the angular distribution of neutrons generated by the pT source is isotropic

as in the 241Am-9Be case.

Neutrons are produced predominantly by the 3H+3H interaction in the pT
source. The reactions that are energetically possible in this system are:

3H(t, nn)4He
∗
(n)4He
3H(t, n1)5He
3H(t, n0)5He(n)4He.

(4)
(5)
(6)

In a measurement at a triton energy Et=500 keV, the branching ratio for
these reactions was found to be 70%:20%:10% (in the same order as they
appear above) [15]. The neutron energy spectrum for each of these reactions
is somewhat diﬀerent. Without any ﬁnal-state eﬀect, the direct three-body
breakup reaction in reaction (4) would yield neutrons at an average energy
of ∼ 1
6Q. With a Q-value of 11.3 MeV, the neutron energy spectrum from
reaction (4) would be a broad peak centered at about 4.7 MeV. This shape is
indeed very similar to the neutron spectrum from 9Be(α,n) sources [16].

2 · 5

The ground state transition (6) yields a 10.4-MeV neutron n0, followed by

13

a 0.9-MeV secondary neutron. The neutron detection eﬃciency for the liq-
uid scintillator is almost null at 0.9 MeV. Reaction (5) is a sequential decay
proceeding through a broad 5He excited state at about 2 MeV. Because of
the small branching ratio for this excited state transition, it would not con-
tribute much to the uncertainty in the extracted neutron generation rate by
the pT source. The uncertainty in the extracted pT -source neutron rate due to
the secondary neutrons is at most 15% if one assumes none of the secondary
neutrons from (5) and (6) were detected. The uncertainty in the extracted pT -
source neutron rate due to n0 and the 14 MeV monoenergetic neutron from
3H(d,n)4He was estimated to be 9% at Ep=29 keV.

Although the neutron detector was placed in diﬀerent orientations to the pT
source in the quality assurance runs and in the gamma-ray angular distribu-
tion measurement, continuous beam-target exchange rendered it impossible
to extract the neutron angular distribution without the presence of a second
neutron detector for normalisation purposes. Wong et al. [15] measured the
angular distribution for the 3H+3H system at Et=500 keV. They found that
the ground state transition neutron group is isotropic to within an accuracy
of ±10%. They also found that in the neutron energy range of 2 to 7.5 MeV,
the continuum neutron group is also isotropic to within an accuracy of ±20%
in the laboratory angle range of 4 to 100◦. For the 3H(d,n)4He reaction, the
angular distribution is isotropic at and below the resonance [17]. Given these
facts, the assumption that the neutrons emitted by the pT source are isotropic
was made in the yield evaluation.

In order to look at the time variation of the neutron production rate by the
pT source more closely, the neutron production rates for all the runs were
renormalised to the same atomic beam energy at 29 keV. In other words, the
rate in all of the Ep=22 keV and 27 keV runs were scaled up by a factor
corresponding to the diﬀerence in cross section at that atomic beam energy
to that at 29 keV. The resulting plot is shown in Figure 12.

In Figure 12, it is clear how the neutron production rate in the pT source varied
over time. The neutron production rate was gradually increasing initially. This
is a clear indication of beam-target exchange, as tritium in the target gets into
the discharge gas stream. The neutron production rate then began to decrease.
This can be explained by the fact that the rate of hydrogen isotope exchange
was reaching an equilibrium, and sputtering of the target became the dominant
process. The target sputtering eﬀect had caused the build-up of a thin ﬁlm on
the high voltage insulator in the acceleration section of the source. Under the
normal operating condition, one end of this insulator is grounded whilst the
other end is biased at ∼-30 kV. With a thin conductive ﬁlm build-up, a leakage
current ﬂowed across the insulator and caused a high voltage breakdown. This
build-up limited the lifetime of the pT source to 98.8 hours.

14

The neutron production rate of the pT source during calibration in the SNO
detector was estimated. Using the highest data point in Figure 12, the maxi-
mum neutron generation rate was estimated to be less than (2.5±0.4)×103 n s−1.
The uncertainty here does not include the monoenergetic neutron and the sec-
ondary neutron contributions discussed above. However, the estimated rate
quoted above should be seen as the upper limit of neutron production as it
was estimated using the highest data point in the data. In Figure 13, the re-
sults of a Monte Carlo simulation of the SNO detector response to neutrons
and gamma rays generated by the pT source are shown. This simulation was
performed using the SNO Monte Carlo and analysis program SNOMAN [18].
In this simulation, fast neutrons generated by the pT source were assumed
to be monoenergetic at 4.7 MeV. Full pT source and deployment capsule ge-
ometries were employed in this simulation, but neutron absorbers inside the
source’s stainless steel deployment housing were not. This is equivalent to as-
suming the worst possible neutron leakage into the heavy water. A neutron
production rate of 2,500 s−1 and a gamma-ray production rate of 0.6 s−1 were
assumed. The spectra in the ﬁgure represent about 3 hours of run time in the
SNO detector. From these ﬁgures, it is clear that the neutron production rate
of the pT source is low enough for an accurate measurement of the 19.8-MeV
photopeak.

8 Conclusions

A functional 19.8-MeV gamma-ray source using the 3H(p, γ)4He reaction was
built. This pT source met all the physical and operational requirements for
calibrating the SNO detector. This is the ﬁrst self-contained, compact and
portable high energy (Eγ >10 MeV) gamma-ray source of this type.

Techniques to fabricate high-quality scandium deuteride and tritide targets
were developed. The tritiated target had a Sc:3H atomic ratio of 1:2.0±0.2.

In the testing of the pT source, 19.8-MeV gamma rays from the pT reaction
were observed and found to be suﬃcient for calibrating the SNO detector. The
neutron production rate by the pT source is also low enough that the neutron
background would not mask the gamma-ray signal during calibration.

The operational lifetime of the pT source was 98.8 hours. Operation was ter-
minated by a thin conducting layer deposited on the high voltage insulator in
the ion acceleration line, which caused a high voltage breakdown across the
insulator. The origin of this layer was scandium sputtering oﬀ the target sur-
face. A second pT source has been constructed with minor engineering changes
to reduce this deposition eﬀect.

15

Calibration of large water ˇCerenkov detectors at energies near the solar neu-
trino endpoint has been a diﬃcult problem. This proof-of-principle experiment
of the pT source opens a window for more convenient calibration standards
in the future. One area in which the pT source can be improved is to imple-
ment a beam analyser to reduce the beam power on the target, and to reduce
the neutron output of the pT source. This feature was not instrumented in
this project because of stringent constraints on the physical size of calibration
sources that can be deployed in the SNO detector.

Fig. 12. Scaled neutron and gamma-ray production by the pT source at Ep=29 keV.
The rates were normalised to the current drawn from the target power supply during
the runs. Also, the production rates for the Ep=22 keV and 27 keV runs have been
scaled to the Ep=29 keV level. The scaling was done by assuming a pure atomic
beam of protons or tritons since the contribution to the signals from molecular
ions are much smaller. The “error bars” on the accumulated beam time for the
gamma-ray results represent the time intervals in which the mean production rates
were calculated.

Fig. 13. Monte Carlo simulated SNO photomultiplier tube array response to neu-
trons and gamma rays that are generated by the pT source. The abscissa value,
Nhits,
is the number of photomultiplier tube hits in the SNO detector. The
Nhits-to-energy calibration in this Monte Carlo represents our best estimate, but
not the calibrated response of the SNO detector. In the pure D2O running sce-
nario (top panel), the peak centering at Nhits ∼50 is the 6.25 MeV photopeak from
2H(n,γ)3H. In the salt running scenario, neutron capture on 35Cl generates a gamma
cascade with a total energy of 8.6 MeV. This is the reason for the broader neutron
capture peak in the bottom panel. In these ﬁgures, a neutron production rate of
2,500 s−1 and a gamma-ray production rate of 0.6 s−1 were assumed. The sharp
“peak” in the bottom panel arises from scaling of the Monte Carlo spectrum to cor-
respond to the neutron production rate above. The spectra represent about 3 hours
of run time in the SNO detector.

Abstract

This paper is devoted to the study of a degradation of CsI(Tl) crystals scin-
tillation characteristics under irradiation with γ-quanta at the uniformly dis-
tributed absorbed dose up to 3700 rad. The sample set consisted of 25 crystals
of 30 cm long having a truncated pyramid shape and 30 rectangular crystals of
the same length. A large diﬀerence in the light output deterioration caused by
the radiation was observed for the samples of the same shape. A substantial
dependence of the average light output loss from the sample shape is seen as
well. On the other hand, the crystals from the same ingot behave very similarly
under irradiation.

1 Introduction

Scintillating crystals of cesium iodide are widely used in high energy physics for
photon detection. Calorimeters made of CsI crystals achieve the best energy
resolution for photons and electrons [ 1, 2].

One of the important characteristics of scintillating materials is their radiation
hardness, i.e. their ability to retain scintillation eﬃciency and uniformity over
the crystal volume after exposure to ionizing radiation. The radiation hardness
of CsI crystals has been previously studied in [ 3, 4, 5, 6]. Each of these
studies was performed with a set of few crystals of diﬀerent sizes and shapes,
produced by diﬀerent manufacturers. Despite the large spread of the results,
it could be deduced that the CsI crystals keep the scintillating properties
at the acceptable level after the absorption of a radiation dose up to a few
hundred rads. Also, it was clear, that the degradation of scintillating properties
of crystals depends signiﬁcantly on growing technology, raw material quality
and size of the crystals.

The interest to the radiation hardness of this material increased with the de-
velopment and construction of B-, φ-, c − τ factories, e.g storage rings with
high luminosity which implies high electron and positron currents, causing
high radiation dose absorbed by the detector components. Recently, this sub-
ject became topical again due to the development of new B-factory projects
with super high luminosity [ 7, 8].

This study was motivated by an active participation of BINP in the devel-
opment and construction of the electromagnetic calorimeter of the BELLE
detector [ 9], in operation now at the KEKB collider with luminosity of
1034 cm−2s−1. The electromagnetic calorimeter of this detector contains 8736
crystals of CsI (Tl). Crystals are truncated pyramids of 300 mm length and
transverse dimensions of 50-60mm. About 2/3 of the calorimeter elements
were produced by BINP in collaboration with the Institute for Single Crystals
of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Kharkov). To achieve and retain
high energy and spatial resolution of the calorimeter it is important that the
light output and uniformity of the crystals do not change signiﬁcantly over a
few years of the experiments at the collider. Therefore, crystals had to pass
rather high requirements on radiation hardness.

During initial stages of the calorimeter development, the studies of the radi-
ation hardness of crystals were performed with a few samples [ 10, 5]. These
studies demonstrated that crystals satisfy the requirements.

This paper is devoted to study the radiation hardness of CsI(Tl) crystals
using a large number of full size samples. All 55 studied crystals were grown
using the same technology by Joint Enterprise ”Amcrys-H” of Scientiﬁc and

2

Technological Concern ”Institute for Single Crystals”, Kharkov, Ukraine. Raw
material for all crystals, high purity CsI, was supplied by Novosibirsk Plant
of Rare Metals. For irradiation of the samples we used wide bremsstrahlung
γ-quanta beam, produced by the 1.4 MeV electron accelerator, ELV-6, at
BINP SB RAS. The absorbed dose was distributed nearly uniformly over the
crystal volume. Another feature of this work is that the absorbed radiation
dose were measured with the detector based on CsI(Tl), thus avoiding error-
prone recalculation of this value depending on the radiation energy spectrum.
Preliminary results were reported at the INSTR-99 conference [ 12].

2 Studied samples and measurements of their scintillation proper-

ties

From 55 studied samples, 25 were selected from crystals produced for the elec-
tromagnetic calorimeter of the BELLE detector. These crystals failed stringent
geometry speciﬁcations or had small mechanical defects but their scintillation
properties met requirements. The samples, further referred as type ”B”, have
a shape of truncated pyramid of 300 mm height and average transverse sizes of
about 60x60 mm2. Detailed description of crystals used in the Belle detector is
given in [ 11]. The studied set comprised the crystals of 16 types which slightly
vary in shape and sizes. Area of the large face of the truncated pyramid varies
from 35 to 47 cm2 while the angle between the pyramid sides and the axis
ranged from 0.8◦ to 1.25◦, depending on the crystal type.

Other 30 studied samples were shaped as rectangular parallelepiped with sizes
of 2×2×30 cm3. These crystals were specially manufactured for the systematic
control of the radiation hardness of the calorimeter elements. These crystals
are referred to as crystals of type ”P”.

Prior to measurements all crystals were polished, wrapped in 200 µm porous
teﬂon and covered with 20 µm thick aluminized mylar ﬁlm.

The measurements of the light output of the crystals of type ”P” can be done
with the photo detector attached to any of two edges of the sample. The light
output depends on whether the other end is covered with reﬂector or not.
Marking one end of the crystal as a, and the another one as b, we classify 4
possible options of the measurements of each crystal in the Table 1. In this
work most measurements were performed using method 1. This method is
implied throughout the text unless otherwise stated. For all measurements
the sides of the crystal were covered by teﬂon and mylar in the same manner
as for the samples of type ”B”.

To measure the scintillation properties of the crystals we used the setup shown

3 Irradiation of the Crystals

Accelerator ELV-6 [ 13] generates continuous 1.4 MeV energy electron beam
with up to 100 mA current. The power in the beam reaches 100 kW. The
beam with such parameters can produce radiation dose intensity of up to 1

5

Mrad/hour. This work studied the radiation hardness at moderate doses, and
the irradiations were performed at a current that did not exceed 100mA.

Fig. 3. The setup for irradiation of crystals with the ELV-6 accelerator. 1 – accel-
erator of electrons ELV-6, 2 – tantalum converter, 3 – bremsstrahlung photons, 4 –
2mm lead plate, 5 – irradiated crystals of CsI(Tl), 6 – detector of radiation dose.

The scheme of the irradiation setup is shown in Fig. 3. The electron beam of
1.4 MeV energy hits the converter (2), composed of 0.5mm Ta, 2mm water
and 2mm stainless steel. Bremsstrahlung γ-quanta produced in the converter
irradiate crystals (5) located under the beam with its axis perpendicular to
the beam direction. Dose detector (6) is placed between the crystals. 2mm
plate of lead is used to suppress the low energy part of the photon spectrum.

The resulting photon beam has wide spectra from 0.2 to 1.4 MeV with maxi-
mum around 0.6 MeV.

The energy deposited by ionizing radiation in a unit mass of the material is
absorbed dose (D). It is measured in units of 1 Gy = 1 J/kg. Another unit of
absorbed dose is 1 rad = 0.01 Gy (1 rad = 10−2 J/kg = 5.24×108 MeV/g).

The absorbed dose is determined by the radiation intensity and spectra, as well
as by the material of the sample. Radiation ﬂux observed by samples consists of
the primary radiation and the photons scattered by the surrounding materials.
That makes calculation of the absorbed dose diﬃcult even for monochromatic
gamma-source. Detectors of absorbed dose are usually based on low-Z ma-
terials; this leads to signiﬁcant systematic errors when re-calculating to CsI.
Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we made the dose detector (DD) on
the basis of scintillation crystal CsI(Tl). Using the CsI as a detector material
we avoid dose recalculation and improve accuracy of absorbed dose measure-
ment.

6

The layout of the DD is shown in Fig. 4. Scintillation crystal CsI(Tl) with
dimensions of 2×2×1 cm3 is coupled to a vacuum photodiode (PD) with mas-
sive photocathode. Photocurrent is proportional to the dose rate in the wide
range of the radiation intensity. It is measured by the voltage drop (V) on the
load resistor (R=50KOhm)

Fig. 4. Detector of absorbed dose. CsI(Tl) - scintillation crystal, PD - Photodiode
with massive photocathode, A - Anode, C - photocathode, R - resistor, V - voltmeter,
U - DC power supply.

Detailed description of the DD design and calibration procedure is given in
Appendix A. It was measured that the intensity of absorbed dose of 1 rad/sec
results in a photocurrent of about 0.3µA. Then the dose D(rad) absorbed by
the crystal during time t0(s) at the current I(µA) can be calculated as:

D =

I(t)dt,

t0

1
IR Z
0

Where IR = 0.3µA · sec/rad.

During the irradiation, the current value was recorded every 20 sec. Typical
time dependence of the dose rate calculated from the DD current is shown in
the Fig. 5.

The relative accuracy of the absorbed dose measurement is about 10% that is
determined by the accuracy of DD calibration and taking into account slow
scintillation components of CsI(Tl).

Simple estimations show that the multiple scattering of the electrons in the
converter result in a good uniformity of the γ-beam over crystal location area.
To check this, the transverse proﬁle of the dose intensity at the ﬁxed accelera-
tor current was measured. Nonuniformity was found to be less than 5% within
the range from -15cm to 15 cm from the electron beam axis.

The γ-beam used for irradiation has wide energy spectrum from 0.2 to 1.4 MeV

with maximum around 0.6MeV. At this energy, the average photon interaction
length in CsI is about 3 cm. Since the transverse size of the crystal is about
6cm the dose absorbed near the upper side of the crystal is a few times higher
than that at the bottom one.

To determine the magnitude of this eﬀect, we performed the following mea-
surement. With certain accelerator current we measured the intensity of the
dose absorbed by the DD (J1). Then the DD was shielded with a 6cm thick
block of CsI and the measurement was repeated at the same accelerator cur-
rent (yielding J2). The ratio k=J1/J2 was found to be equal to 3.2 which,
assuming the exponential dependence of the absorbed dose on the depth, cor-
responds to the average γ-quanta attenuation length of 5.2cm.

To compensate this nonuniformity each sample was irradiated with equal doses
from opposite sides. Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the dose on the depth
calculated for k=3.2. It can be seen from the picture that nonuniformity of
the absorbed dose over the depth is about 15%.

4 Changes of the crystal scintillation characteristics induced by

the radiation

The light output of every crystal was measured several times before and after
each irradiation. Irradiation sessions were carried out consecutively with 2-
6 weeks intervals between them. No more than 3 samples of type ”B” or 5
samples of type ”P” were irradiated simultaneously in the same session.

Fig. 6. The distribution of the absorbed dose over the crystal depth after irradiation
from both sides.

Signiﬁcant afterglow of CsI(Tl) makes it diﬃcult to measure the light output
right after the irradiation. So, the ﬁrst measurement was performed only one
day after the irradiation when the afterglow became low enough not to broaden
and shift the photo-peak signiﬁcantly.

Fig. 7 shows the average light output of two ”P”-type crystals as a function
of time. Stability of the measurements performed between the irradiations
is better than 1% which allows seeing sharp drops in the light output after
irradiations with doses 700 and 3200 rad. Gradual increase in the light output
after the second irradiation could be interpreted as a partial recovery of the
light-output. This issue will be discussed in more details in the section 6.

4.1 Measurements with the type ”B” crystals (pyramids)

From the set of 25 samples shaped as truncated pyramids nine crystals were
irradiated several times up to the integrated dose of 3600-3700 rad, six crystals
up to 1300-1400 rad, while other 10 samples were irradiated twice — up to
740-780 rad and 3000-3200 rad.

Fig. 8 shows the degradation of the light output, ∆L/L, as a function of the
absorbed dose for seven pyramid-shaped crystals (type ”B”). As it’s seen in the

ﬁgure, all crystals are characterized by similar curves. The light output drops
fast at the small irradiation doses but at higher doses it decreases slower. For
example, for the crystal B91 the drop was 7% after irradiation with 220rad,
but only 27% after increase of the dose up to 3.6 Krad.

Fig. 9 shows the distribution of type ”B” samples over the light-output loss,
∆L/L, after all irradiations. It can be seen that the distribution is very wide.
Thus, after irradiation with 700-800 rad, ∆L/L varies from 5% to 21%.

As it was mentioned earlier one source of raw material and one technology were
used for the production of all studied crystals. Therefore, the wide spread
in ∆L/L is an evidence that the radiation hardness is, probably, strongly
dependent on uncontrolled impurities in the raw material or slight variations
in the crystal growth regime causing defects in the crystal lattice.

Production of crystals for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle detec-
tor, from which the samples studied in this work were selected, took about
four years. It took over three years to produce crystals for the barrel part of

the calorimeter while all the crystals for the endcaps were produces in the
last 8 months. One could suppose that over the long production period both
growth technology and raw material could vary. In Fig. 9 the endcap type
crystals produced near the end of the production are specially marked. As we
can see from the picture the distributions over the ∆L/L for these crystals
are very similar to those for the barrel ones.

Fig.10 shows the average values of ∆L/L as a function of absorbed dose.
Points corresponding to the ”endcap” crystals are somewhat lower than the
rest although the diﬀerence is insigniﬁcant when compared to the statistical
errors.

Values of ∆L/L obtained in this study do not contradict to the results of the
earlier measurements of the radiation hardness of a few samples for the electro-
magnetic calorimeter of BELLE produced by Crysmatec, Shanghai Institute
of Ceramics (SIC) and Kharkov Institute for Single Crystals [5].

We estimate the accuracy of the light output measurements in this work by
about 1%. Therefore, the width of the distribution over ∆L/L at a given
absorbed dose (see Fig. 9) is not determined by the measurement errors. This
conclusion is supported by a good correlation between the decreases of the
light output of the same crystal after irradiation with diﬀerent doses. Such
correlation is presented in Fig.11.

Strong positive correlation which can be seen in Fig. 11 supports the conclusion
made earlier that the ∆L/L dependence on the absorbed dose has similar

shape for all crystals.

The observed correlation makes possible the procedure of the radiation hard-
ness control for each crystal individually. By measuring the decrease of the
light output after irradiation with a relatively small dose and further extrap-
olating to higher doses, one could come to an expectation about the ability of
the crystal to withstand required radiation load.

Another conclusion can be made from the obtained results that if the crys-
tals are to work under high radiation background when radiation hardness is
important, it is necessary to study the radiation hardness of suﬃciently large
set of crystals.

Since this work was initiated by the Belle detector construction it should be
noted that all the studied samples satisﬁed the radiation hardness speciﬁca-
tions required for the elements of the calorimeter.

It should be noted as well, that some of the studied samples demonstrated
very high for the alcali halide crystals radiation hardness (∆L/L=8% at 3.2
Krad). It indicates that the production of the radiation hard CsI crystals is
possible after improvements of the growing technology.

4.2 Measurements with the type ”P” crystals (parallelepiped)

The set of ”P” crystals contained 30 rectangular samples of 2 × 2 × 30 cm3
size. 25 of them were irradiated with 650 rad dose in one exposition and later
with additional dose of 2550 rad that resulted in the integrated dose of 3200
rad. 5 crystals were irradiated only once with the dose of 3200 rad.

The distributions over ∆L/L for ”P” samples after the irradiation with 650
and 3200 rad are shown in Fig. 12.

The distribution is wide like for the ”B” crystals case. However, the average
decrease is much less — < ∆L/L >= (4.2±1.8)% at 650 rad and < ∆L/L >=
(9.0 ± 3.9)% at 3200 rad. Comparison of these results with those shown in
Fig. 10 leads to a conclusion that the light output decrease for parallelepiped
shaped crystals is 2-3 times less that that for pyramid ones. This eﬀect will
be discussed in more details in the section 8.

The correlation between the light output decrease after the irradiation with
650 rad and 3200 rad is shown in Fig. 13. Similarly to the crystals ”B”, good
correlation between ∆L/L values after irradiation with various doses is seen.

4.3 The light output change for type ”P” crystals at the various light collec-

tion conditions

As it was mentioned in the section 2 there are several options for light read
out for ”P” crystals (see Table 1). To estimate the precision of the ∆L/L
measurement and the inﬂuence of the uncontrolled variations in the polishing
of the crystal faces as well as wrapping with teﬂon, we compared the light
output after 650 rad dose irradiation measured by option 1 (light is read from
the edge a while the edge b is covered with two layers of teﬂon ) and option
3 (light is read from the edge b while the edge a is covered with two layers
of teﬂon). The results are presented in Fig. 14. Clear correlation between

the measurements performed by two options leads to the conclusion that the
uncontrolled variations in the procedure of the detector preparation do not
contribute substantially to our measurements.

Fig. 15 shows a comparison of ∆L/L values for 25 samples of ”P” type mea-
sured after 650 rad dose irradiation by option 1 (light is read from the edge a
while the edge b is covered with two teﬂon layers) and option 2 (light is read
from the edge a while the edge b is open). Good correspondence between the
results obtained in both options is seen. The light output deterioration with
the open rare edge somewhat less than that with covered one.

5 Radiation hardness of the crystals produced from the same ingot

Among the samples of ”B” type two pairs of crystals were produced from the
same ingot: samples B62 and B67 were cut from one ingot, while both samples
B65 and B64 were made from the another one.

The set of ”P” crystals contained 8 pairs of such type. In the plot of Fig. 16
the X-axis corresponds to ∆L/L value for the ﬁrst crystal from the pair while
this value for the second crystal of the same pair is shown along the Y-axis.
Presented results were taken for all 10 pairs of crystals after irradiation with
the dose of 650-780 rad (a) and dose of 3200 rad (b). As it’s seen in the ﬁgure
the radiation hardness of the crystals produced from the same ingot is the
same within the measurement accuracy both for ”B” type samples and for

Thus, one has to conclude that the light output deterioration of the irradi-
ated crystals is determined mostly by the properties of grown ingot while the
variation of the material properties over ingot volume as well as the uncontrol-
lable changes of the procedure of the crystal processing make much smaller
contribution.

The observed correlation provides a possibility for mass control of the radiation
hardness of the detectors. It’s enough for that to irradiate one sample from
each ingot with the desirable dose.

Light output self-recovery after irradiation

Some scintillation crystal manifest the natural recovery of the light output
damaged due to irradiation. This process was observed for BGO [ 14], BaF2 [
15], PbWO4 [ 16] and for some other materials. Existence of such a recovery
for cesium iodide crystals was noted in the works [ 5, 17].

To study this eﬀect the special measurements with 5 samples of ”P” type were
performed. The light output and nonuniformity were measured daily during
several days before irradiation and after one of 3200 rad. However, it should
be remarked that the recovery observation for CsI(Tl) crystals is complicated
due to high afterglow that makes the measurements rather inaccurate in the
ﬁrst day after the irradiation.

Fig. 17 presents light output time dependence before and after irradiation for
ﬁve crystals (P901 - P905). The results for one crystal (P925) which was not
irradiated is presented as well for comparison. It’s seen that the light output
is being recovered with a time constant of a few days up to 20% of the initial
radiation damage.

However, the reliable conclusion on the recovery observation can be barely
made since the recovery level is not large and we can’t exclude that the after-
glow can cause some average shift of the signal at the ﬁrst measurement.

7 Change of the crystal light output nonuniformity after irradia-

tion

Some change of nonuniformity was observed after irradiation with a dose of
3200 rad. For example, Fig. 18 shows the nonuniformity time dependence for
several crystals of ”P” type. Certain deterioration of light output uniformity
is seen for all irradiated crystals after dose of 3200 rad. The nonuniformity
of the sample P925 which was not irradiated referred for a comparison. The
value of the crystal nonuniformity was deﬁned by the formulae (3).

8 Discussion

Most of the papers devoted to a study of radiation hardness of scintillation
crystals consider the optical transparency deterioration as a main reason of
light output loss after the irradiation (see, for example, [ 18, 6]). On the other
hand, some authors presented mechanism of the damage of intrinsic scintilla-

of the physical models of the radiation induced changes of the properties of
the scintillation crystals as well as the wide bibliography on this subject can
be found in the book [ 21].

In this work we did not make special studies of the mechanism of the light
output degradation. It’s worth to remark, however, that during all of the time
of this work the dose intensity were measured with only one small CsI(Tl)
crystal (2 × 2 × 1cm3) which were calibrated time to time. The total dose
absorbed by this crystals amounted to 50 krad. Nevertheless, we did not ob-
serve considerable decrease of light output of this crystal within few percent
of accuracy of measurements . In contrast, the light output loss of the large
crystals occur at the much lower absorbed dose that can be explained assum-
ing that the increasing light absorbtion provides the main contribution to the
light output degradation.

In general, the inference that the main radiation stimulated eﬀect is the loss
of optical transparency of the crystal, looks to be well-grounded, at least for

moderate doses of radiation. Following arguments provide evidence for this:

• the radiation induced absorbtion are really observed in the direct measure-
ments of the optical transparency of crystals [ 5, 22] and its quantity does
not contradict to observed light output decrease for the detectors of real
sizes;

• crystals of small sizes demonstrate much lower degradation of light output

than the large crystals at the same dose.

It should be noted that besides the loss of the optical transparency, the ir-
radiation can produce both elastic and inelastic centers of photon scattering
in the material. This eﬀect can provide the deterioration of the light collec-
tion eﬃciency as well. However, this eﬀect was not carefully studied for CsI
crystals.

Let’s discuss the results obtained in the sections 4.1 and 4.2. Here, ﬁrst of all,
two features attract an attention: a) large spread of the light output loss values
after irradiation for diﬀerent samples of the same type and b) considerable

19

average diﬀerence in ∆L/L between samples having the shape of truncated
pyramid and parallelepiped.

The conclusion coming from a) is the radiation hardness of the crystals de-
pends strongly from uncontrolled variations in the growing technology from
one ingot to the another one. The high correlation between the radiation
hardness of the samples produced from the same ingot is the evidence of small
variations of the conditions during the growing process. When the radiation
hardness is a critical parameter of the detector, the tests for at least one sample
cut from each ingot should be performed.

Then we would like to refer some considerations which can explain the eﬀect
b). First of all, the light collection conditions for ”B” and ”P” samples should
be considered. The sensitive area of PM tube photocathode, Sph ≈ 16 cm2,
out=4 cm2, while this
covers completely the output edge of ”P” type crystals SP
coverage is only partial for crystals of type ”B”, SB
out =
0.35÷0.44. Meanwhile, the average light output for crystals of ”B” type is only
15% less than that for ”P” crystals. One can suppose that the light collection
in ”B” crystals involves substantially photons which had multiple reﬂection at
the crystal sides and, possibly, the scattering in the crystal volume. Besides,
the shape of the crystal plays substantial role for the light collection. These
eﬀects should lead to the increase of the photon mean path before it hits
PM tube and, respectively, to the higher sensitivity to the loss of the optical
transparency.

out= 35÷47 cm2, Sph/SB

The initial values of the light output and the values of ∆L/L for 19 irradi-
ated crystals of ”B” type versus the square, S, of the output crystal face are
presented in Fig. 19. Some correlation between light output and S as well as
between ∆L/L and S can be seen in spite of the large spread of data.

9 Conclusion

In conclusion we list the main results of this study:

• In general, all studied crystals have high enough radiation hardness to be

used in the detectors for existing B-factories;

• Crystals produced within one technology using the raw material from the
same manufacturer demonstrate, nevertheless, large spread of values of ra-
diation stimulated light output loss;

• However, crystals cut from the same ingot have the same level of radiation

hardness;

• Large diﬀerence in the values of radiation induced light collection eﬃciency
loss for the samples of diﬀerent geometry was observed. This is an evidence
of the substantial dependence of the radiation hardness on the shape of the
crystal and light collection conditions.

• There are some samples with high (for alcali halide scintillation crystals)
radiation hardness (∆L/L=8% at 3200 rad of absorbed dose). This conﬁrms
a principle possibility of the mass production of radiation hard crystals after
certain technology upgrade.

A Absorbed dose measurement

The detector of radiation dose in this work based on CsI(Tl) crystal. This
detector of 20 × 20 × 10 mm3 size was covered with two layers of the 200 µm
porous teﬂon tape. The light signal is read out with a vacuum photodiode
(VPD) with massive photocathode. The bias voltage of 40 V is applied as it
is shown in Fig. 4. The current trough the photodiode is measured.

The choice of the VPD with the solid photocathode is caused by the reason
that the measured current can be rather high, up to 10–20 µA. The vacuum
photodetectors with semitransparent photocathodes loose the eﬃciency when
the photo current exceeds ∼ 10nA due to the disturbance of the electric po-
tential over the cathode surface.

The another option for the scintillation light read out is the usage of the silicon
photodiode. But in this case one must take into account the current induced
by the interaction of gamma radiation with silicon in addition to the photo
current that can decrease the accuracy of the measurement.

The dose rate is determined by the expression:

where ID — measured photo current, and IR is the calibration constant, that
is equal to the photo current value at the dose rate of 1 rad/sec.

where C=6,24×108 MeV/g; m is crystal mass in g; e is an electron charge, N M
e
– normalization constant, the number of electrons passed trough photodiode
per 1 MeV of the energy absorbed by CsI; Kτ is a correction factor that will
be explained later.

Thus, the key task for the described method of the dose measurement is the
correct calibration, i.e. a determination of the N M
e value and, with its help,
the value of IR.

The layout of the DD calibration is presented in Fig. A.1

A photodiode is connected to the input of the charge sensitive preampliﬁer
(CSPA). The output signal comes to the shaping ampliﬁer with the shaping
time of 2 µs. The shaped pulse is digitized by the ADC.

At the ﬁrst stage of the calibration the ADC scale constant was determined,
i.e. the number of electrons at the CSPA input pulse that corresponds to

photodiode irradiated with γ-quanta of 60 keV energy from 241Am source. The
calibration constant was determined as:

where Apeak is a peak position in the pulse height spectrum, Ei — the average
ionization energy for silicon, Ei = 3.62 eV.

To measure the signal amplitude corresponding to the 1 MeV energy absorbed
in the CsI(Tl) crystal the α-source 238P u (Eα = 5.1 MeV ) was used. The direct
measurement of this value with γ-source 137Cs (662 keV) or 22Na (511 keV
and 1275 keV) was not possible since the noise level was found to be equivalent
of 300 keV. To avoid the α-particle absorption in the teﬂon coverage of the
crystal, the small hole of about 1 mm2 was made in that. The measured pulse
height spectrum is shown in Fig. A.2.

It’s known that the scintillation light output for α-particle is lower than that
for photons or electrons due to much higher ionization density. The ratio of the
signals from 238P u and total absorption peak of 137Cs was measured separately
with the light read out with PM tube. For the crystal used in DD it was found
that peak of 238P u corresponds to 3.71 ± 0.09 MeV of photon energy.

noted that for ADC scale calibration the short pulse (about 10 ns) from PIN
photodiode was used while the scintillation ﬂash of CsI(Tl) has much longer
decay time.

To take this eﬀect into account, the correction factor, Kτ , was implemented
to the formulae (A.2). Its value was calculated using the light pulse shape
measured in [ 23] where the experimental shape of this pulse was well approx-
imated by the sum of three exponents with the decay constants of τ1 = 0.7µs,
τ2 = 2.5µs and τ3 = 17µs. As a Laplas representation of the shaper (ORTEC

KL(p) =

p
s (p + 1/τs)3 ,
τ 2

where τs is the shaping time. This formula implied the single diﬀerentiation
and double integration provides good approximation of the output pulse shape
that corresponds to the input step pulse. The measured value of the correction
factor was Kτ = 1.4.

As a result of the described calibration procedure the value of IR = 0.3µA·s/rad
was obtained. This procedure was repeated several times with the interval of
several months giving the close results of IR.

We estimate the relative error of the absorption dose measurement with the
described method by about 10%. The main contributions to the inaccuracy are
connected with the inexact description of the slow components of scintillator
decay time as well as with precision of the measurement of α/γ ratio.

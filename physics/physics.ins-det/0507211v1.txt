Abstract

A prototype Secondary-electron Emission Monitor (SEM) was installed in the 8 GeV
proton transport line for the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab. The SEM is a
segmented grid made with 5 µm Ti foils, intended for use in the 120 GeV NuMI
beam at Fermilab. Similar to previous workers, we found that the full collection of
the secondary electron signal requires a bias voltage to draw the ejected electrons
cleanly oﬀ the foils, and this eﬀect is more pronounced at larger beam intensity. The
beam centroid and width resolutions of the SEM were measured at beam widths
of 3, 7, and 8 mm, and compared to calculations. Extrapolating the data from this
beam test, we expect a centroid and width resolutions of δxbeam = 20 µm and
δσbeam = 25 µm, respectively, in the NuMI beam which has 1 mm spot size.

1 Introduction

Beam proﬁles may be measured via the process of secondary electron emission[1].
A secondary electron monitor (SEM) consists of a metal screen of low work
function from which low (<100 eV) energy electrons are ejected. While the
probability for secondary electron emission is low (∼0.01/beam particle), these
devices can produce signals of 10-100nC when 4 × 1013 beam particles per spill

pass through the device, permitting their use as beam monitors[2]. Further-
more, the process of secondary electron emission is a surface phenomenon[3],
so that electron emitting foils or wires of very thin (1-10 µm) dimensions may
be used without penalty to the signal size[4]. Often a positive voltage on a
nearby foil (”clearing ﬁeld”) is used to draw the secondary electrons cleanly
away from the signal screen. A schematic SEM is shown in Figure 1.

Secondary electron emission monitors have replaced ionization chambers as
beam monitors for over 40 years[2]. An ionization chamber monitors beam in-
tensity by measuring the ionized charge in a gas volume collected on a chamber
electrode. Such a device places a large amount of material (∼ 10−2 −10−3 λint)
in the beam which results in emittance blowup and beam loss, both of which
are unacceptable in high intensity beams. A further limitation of ionization
chambers is that space charge buildup limits them to measurements of beams
with intenstities of < 1016 particles/cm2/sec[5], nearly 5 orders of magnitude
below requirements of present extracted beamlines. SEM’s, in contrast, are
extremely linear in response [2,6], and the prototype SEM discussed in this
note is 7 × 10−6 interaction lengths thick.

For the NuMI beam [7], we desire a segmented SEM which measures the
beam intensity, the beam centroid position, and the beam’s lateral proﬁle.
The beam spot is anticipated to be ∼1mm. The required SEM segmentation
is of order 1mm. The two SEM’s near the NuMI target require segmentation
of 0.5mm in order to specify the beam position and angle onto the target at
the 50 µrad level. The segmented SEM will measure proﬁle out to 22 mm
in the horizontal and vertical. A single, large foil will cover the remaining
aperture out to 50 mm radius in order to measure any potential beam halo.
Additional thin foil SEM’s are envisaged for the 8 GeV transport line for
the MiniBooNE experiment [8] and for the transfer line between the 8 GeV
Booster and 120 GeV Main Injector at FNAL.

A prototype SEM was tested in the 8 GeV beam transport line for the Mini-
BooNE experiment in May 2003. While the MiniBooNE beam parameters
diﬀer from those anticipated for NuMI (see Table 1), this test permitted early
veriﬁcation of the foil SEM design. Some diﬀerences, listed in Table 1, exist
between the foils designed for the prototype and the ﬁnal SEM chambers in-
stalled in the NuMI line. Further details of the prototype design are given in
Section 2, while the ﬁnal SEM design description can be found in Ref [9].

During the beam tests, the SEM was used to measure beam position and size
at one location in the MiniBooNE line. Because it was the only proﬁle monitor
in that portion of the transport line, no independent measurement existed to
corroborate the prototype’s beam size measurements. A pair of nearby capac-
itative Beam Position Monitors (BPM’s) was able to corroborate the SEM’s
beam centroid measurement. The SEM’s expected beam centroid resolution
and beam width resolution are related, however, because both depend upon
several aspects of the SEM design, such as readout noise and the position
accuracy of the segmented SEM grid assembly. In this note, we analyze the
SEM’s centroid and width resolution during the test in the MiniBooNE line.
These measurements are compared to calculations of expected centroid reso-
lution performance. Following the validation of the calculations using the test
beam data, we extrapolate the expected beam size resolution achievable from
the SEM’s to the case for the narrow NuMI beam.

on rails, and the vacuum during the motion is maintained by a bellows feedthrough
mounted to the vacuum chamber lid. The assembly shown is approximately 75 cm
long by 30 cm tall.

2 SEM Prototype

Borrowing from a design in use at CERN [10], the foil SEM built for this
beam test had ﬁve planes of 5 µm thick Titanium foils, as in Figure 1. The
ﬁrst, third, and ﬁfth planes were solid foils biased to as much as 100 Volts.
Planes 2 and 4 were segmented at 1 mm pitch (0.75 mm wide strips with
0.25 mm gaps between adjacent strips). The strips were mounted on ceramic
combs with rectangular grooves which mechancally held the strips and aligned
them onto the grid. Each strip had an accordion-like spring to tension it and
compensate for beam heating. The foil strips for the prototype were quite long,
ranging from 15-25 cm in length. Each strip was read out separately into a
charge-integrating circuit[11] gated around the beam spill.

A new aspect of the present SEM design is that the foils were mounted on
a frame which does not traverse the beam as the SEM is inserted into or re-
tracted from the beam. The segmented foils are mounted at ±45◦ to provide
both horizontal and vertical beam proﬁles, and these are mounted on a hexag-
onal frame which encloses the beam at all times, leaving a clear space when
it is desired to retract the foils away from the beam, as shown in Figure 2.
The signals from the foils are routed through a vacuum bellows feedthrough

4

via kapton-insulated cables to a signal feedthrough box shown at the right of
the photo. While the ﬁnal NuMI SEM chambers have stepper motor-driven
actuators [9] to move the foils into or out of the beam, the prototype required
manual manipulation of the bellows feedthrough to insert the foil paddle. A
photograph of the SEM, mounted in its rectangular vacuum chamber and
installed in the 8 GeV transport line, is shown in Figure 3.

The use of Titanium as the active medium was motivated by the loss of Sec-
ondary Electron Emission (SEE) signal from other materials after prolonged
exposure in the beam [12,13,14,15]. For beam nominally on center through a
long run, such signal loss results in degraded beam centroid magnitude and
also results in artiﬁcially enhanced beam tails, since the beam tails irradiate
the SEM to a lesser extent. Titanium suﬀers less from the loss of SEE signal,
even for relatively simple cleaning and handling procedures for the foils [15].

3 Data analysis

Figure 4 shows a schematic of the 8 GeV MiniBooNE transport line elements
near the foil SEM location. To analyse the SEM data we wanted to correlate
it with data from nearby BPM’s. However, there is no simple linear rela-
tion between all the BPM and SEM data. Changing magnet currents, beam
position and intensity causes both the slope and the oﬀset in the relation be-
tween SEM and BPM to change. The situation is worse for horizontal than
for vertical plane since there are magnets in between the SEM prototype and

horizontal BPM.

The data, consisting of ∼80,000 spills, was split into periods during which the
currents in nearby dipole, quadrupole, and trim magnets, as well as the beam
intensity, were relatively constant. The beam current transformer Tor860 was
used for intensity monitoring. Only the spills with suﬃciently high intensity
(∼ 1012 ppp) were analysed.

Figure 5 shows one example of the horizontal and vertical beam proﬁles as seen
by the SEM in one spill with 4.5 × 1012 protons per pulse (ppp). The vertical
axis on these plots is the pulse height from a given strip[16]. The beam was
broader in the horizontal direction and narrower in the vertical direction. Both
horizontal and vertical beam widths roughly agree with expectations based on
the β functions for the transport line.

Fig. 6. (Normalized) total charge collected from the SEM summed over all 44 strips,
plotted as a function of the applied bias voltage. The data were taken at several
beam intensities, ranging from 4×1011 protons/pulse to 4×1012 protons/pulse.

4 Bias Voltage Study

The voltage applied to the SEM’s bias foils was typically 100 Volts, greater
than the typical 20-30 eV kinetic energy of secondary electrons emitted from
a foil surface.[1] To understand the eﬀect of the bias voltage on the signal
collection eﬃciency, we accumulated data at several ﬁxed beam intensities
varying from 4 × 1011 protons/pulse (ppp) to 4 × 1012 ppp. During each period
of ﬁxed beam intensity, the voltage applied to the bias foils was varied and
the total charge collected from all the signal strips measured. The results are
plotted in Figure 6. The signal collected from the SEM is normalized to 100%
eﬃciency by dividing by the signal collected at 4 × 1012 ppp and 100 Volts.
Both the horizontal and vertical signal foils agree within 1.5%. As can be
seen, applying a voltage increases the eﬃciency, as has been noted by others
[12,17]. Also, our data suggest that the required applied voltage to achieve
100% eﬃciency increases as the beam intensity increases. The magnitude of
this eﬀect may reﬂect surface impurities on the foils or be caused by the
relatively poor vacuum in this chamber, which was several 10−7 Torr during
the test.

Fig. 7. (left) The correlation between positions measured by the vertical BPM and
those measured by the SEM. (right) The residuals from the best ﬁt line. From the
residuals we can infer that the sum in quadrature of BPM and SEM resolutions is
127µm.

5 Measured SEM Centroid Resolution

The centroid resolution of the SEM depends upon the width of the beam, the
intensity of the beam, and upon the electronics readout noise on the SEM
channels. The beam width in vertical direction was nearly constant at σx =
3.4 mm, while the horizontal beam size varied between σy = 7.4 mm and
σy = 8.2 mm, during the test period. This gives us 3 diﬀerent beam widths
for which we try to ﬁnd the SEM centroid resolution.

To ﬁnd the beam centroid resolution in the vertical plane we correlate its
reported beam position with that of the BPM labelled VP871. Figure 7 shows
the BPM data ploted versus SEM data over a range of spills in which the
beam was observed to move substantially across the chambers. The residuals
of the data from the best ﬁt line are also shown in a ﬁgure, and show an RMS
of 127 µm. The residuals should be a measure of the two devices’ resolutions,
added in quadrature:

qσ2

SEM + (ασBP M )2 = 127 µm.

(1)

where σSEM and σBP M are the intrinsic resolutions of the detectors, and α =
1.1 is a scale factor between the SEM and BPM which is taken from the slope
of the line in Figure 7. This scale factor can result from either optics of the
transport line or miscalibrations between the SEM and BPM.

In order to separate the individual BPM and SEM resolutions, we select a
diﬀerent time span of spills in which the beam position at the detectors was

a time period of 1329 spills when beam position is nearly constant.

observed to be consistent from spill to spill (to within <0.5mm). Figure 8 shows
a histogram of the beam positions, as measured in each of the detectors, for
one such interval of 1329 spills in which the beam motion was relatively small.
The RMS of the beam centroid positions spill-to-spill is a measure of both the
beam wandering and the device resolution, ie.

SEM + σ2
RMSSEM = qσ2
RMSBP M = q(ασBP M )2 + σ2

wander = 97.8µm

wander = 129.1µm

(2)

where σwander is a measure of the RMS variation of the beam motion spill-
to-spill due to variations in the beamline performance, σBP M is the intrinsic
resolutions of the BPM, σSEM is the intrinsic resolutions of the SEM, and
α is the scale factor to account for diﬀerences between the SEM and BPM
calibrations. The quantity σwander is not a priori known and varies from time
interval to time interval but it should be the same for both devices because of
their proximity. As may be seen in Figure 8, the BPM spread is larger than
the SEM spread, suggesting σSEM < σBP M . 1

Combining the expressions in Equation 1 and Equation 2, and using α = 1.1
for the scale factor between BPM and SEM positions, we may obtain:

1 In fact, we selected over 20 such time spans of relatively stable beam and found
that the spill-to-spill variation reported by the BPM was greater than that reported
by the SEM.

σSEM = 67 ± 5µm
σBP M = 98 ± 5µm

9

We have repeated this analysis of the vertical beam data for several time
intervals. The resolutions are observed to vary by an RMS of 5 µm, with the
variation possibly due to beam-related eﬀects or variation in resolution across
the aperture of the SEM or BPM.

In the horizontal view the presence of the focusing quadrupoles 870A and
870B, as well as the trim magnet HT870, complicates direct comparison of the
beam position reported by the prototype SEM and the nearby horizontal BPM
labelled HP870. Furthermore, the beam width varied between 7.4 mm and 8.2
mm, and was correlated with two diﬀerent beam intensities. The expected
SEM centroid resolution is quite diﬀerent for those two beam widths, so we
split data into two sets. We looked at 32 intervals with 1000 spills each. We
assumed that the resolution for the horizontal BPM HP870 is the same as
for the identically-constructed vertical BPM VP871. In each time interval we
could ﬁnd beam wandering (σwander) from the BPM measurements and then
plug that into SEM data and ﬁnd σSEM . As a result we ﬁnd:

σSEM (σx = 7.4mm) = 151 ± 5µm
σSEM (σx = 8.2mm) = 171 ± 5µm

6 Expected SEM Resolution

The previous section measured the centroid resolution at three diﬀerent beam
widths. A less reliable estimate was also made of the beam width resolution
(see below). The beam centroid and width resolutions of a SEM grid are
aﬀected by several instrumental factors[18]:

• The signal noise on each individual SEM strip (δyi).
• The non-uniformity in strip spacing (δxi)
• The number of SEM strips per beam σ

The ﬁrst eﬀect listed above smears the pulse height yi observed on an individ-
ual strip i by an amount δyi = qδ2 + (εyi)2, where δ is a presumed constant
pulse height resolution and ε describes a signal size-dependent resolution. The
second eﬀect, which arises due to the fact that the foil strips are not perfectly
positioned on the grid, causes a smearing of the actual position xi of the strips.
This form of strip placement error we accounted for by assuming an additional
uncertainty of the strip pulse heights of δyi = f ′(x) · δxi where f ′(x) is the
derivative of the gaussian ﬁtting function that we use to describe the beam
proﬁle and δxi is the uncertainty in the strip positions.

We ﬁt our beam test data to a model of expected beam centroid resolution
which incorporates the above eﬀects. We simulated beam spills in a 44-channel

10

Fig. 9. Comparison of the measured resolution of the centroid position from this
beam test to a calculation based on simulated data for diﬀerent beam widths. The

stant intensity is assumed in the calculation.

detector whose signals were smeared to account for electronics noise and foil
strip misalignments. Such simulated data was generated for diﬀerent beam
widths, and for diﬀerent assumptions on the electronics noise and strip mis-
alignments. By comparing to our data, we could in eﬀect measure the elec-
tronics noise.

Our test beam data is overlaid with the corresponding calculations in Figure 9
and 10. As can be seen, we anticipate smaller centroid and width resolutions
for narrower beams, until the beam width σbeam = 1.0 mm, which corresponds
to the strip-to-strip spacing for our SEM. As the beam becomes narrower, the
centroid and width resolutions are more sensitive to the placement accuracy
δxi of the strips in the SEM grid. Our calculation is performed for three
diﬀerent accuracies, δxi = 10, 50, and 100 µm. We expect δxi = 50 µm for
the prototype and δxi = 10 µm will be achieved for the ﬁnal NuMI SEM’s.
Figure 9 indicates a centroid resolution of order 20-30 µm may be anticipated
in the NuMI beam line, where the beam width σbeam is about 1.0 mm.

Fig. 10. Comparison of the measured resolution of the beam width from this beam
test to a calculation based on simulated data for diﬀerent beam widths. The quantity
δx is the amount by which the foil strips are misplaced on the grid. Constant
intensity is assumed in the calculation.

We have also tried to understand the expected resolution of the beam width
measured by the SEM grid. Figure 10 shows the expected resolution of the
beam width as a function of the beam width. Overlaid on the plot in Figure 10
are two points derived from the MiniBooNE test beam run which are the
variation of the width in the vertical plane as observed over two ranges of
beam spills. A similar procedure was not possible in the horizontal, as the
beam width was observed to vary dramatically at high beam intensity to to
emittance variation from the 8 GeV Booster accelerator, an eﬀect conﬁrmed
by other instrumentation in the transport line.

7 Conclusion

From the prototype data we observe that the beam centroid resolution of
the 1 mm pitch SEM prototype is around 64 ± 5 µm for the beam with

12

σ = 3.5 mm. From the extrapolation in Figure 9 to beam widths relevant
for NuMI, we anticipate a centroid resolution of 20-25 µm for a 1 mm beam.
Although the beam intensity will be a factor of 5 larger in the NuMI beam,
which might be expected to improve the SEM resolution due to increased
signal size, this signal increase will be compensated by a signal decrease arising
from the narrower foil strip size in the NuMI SEM’s. Thus, the extrapolation
shown in Figures 9 and 10 should be approximately correct.

The two SEM’s just upstream of the NuMI target will have ﬁner pitch than the
prototype SEM (0.5 mm compared to 1.0 mm), and also wider strips (0.25mm
as compared to the 0.15mm of the transport line SEM’s). One therefore expects
that (a) the mechanical assembly details of the 0.5mm SEM’s shall not be as
critical, since the beam size will be larger than the strip spacing, and (b) the
pulse height smearing will not as greatly aﬀect their resolutions because the
wider strips will yield a 1.7 times greater signal. The results of the present
study suggest that these 0.5 mm SEM’s should behave in a 1.0 mm beam
much like the 1.0 mm prototype performance for a 2.0 mm beam. That is,
an approximate scaling relation should exist between the strip pitch and the
beam width.

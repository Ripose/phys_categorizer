Abstract

The BiPo project is dedicated to the measurement of extremely low radioactivity con-
tamination of SuperNEMO source foils (208Tl < 2 µBq/kg and 214Bi < 10 µBq/kg). The
R&D phase is started: a modular BiPo prototype with its shielding test facility is un-
der construction. The goal of this prototype is to study the background and particularly
the surface contamination of scintillators. The ﬁrst capsule has been installed in the Can-
franc Underground Laboratory in October, 17th and is now taking data. After 10.7 days
of measurements, a preliminary upper limit on the surface radiopurity of the scintillators of
A(208Tl) < 60 µBq/m2 (90% C. L.) has been obtained.

Introduction

The BiPo detector is dedicated to the measurement of the ultra high radiopurity in 214Bi and
208Tl of ultra thin materials and especially the double beta source foils of the SuperNEMO
detector. The expected sensitivity is 208Tl < 2 µBq/kg and 214Bi < 10 µBq/kg.

In order to measure 208Tl and 214Bi contaminations, the original idea of the BiPo detector
is to detect the so-called Bi-Po process, a double detection of an electron followed by a delayed
alpha, with organic scintillators. The 214Bi isotope is nearly a pure β emitter (Qβ = 3.27 MeV)
decaying into 214Po, an α emitter with an half-life of 164 µs. The 208Tl isotope is measured
by detecting its parent the 212Bi isotope. 212Bi decays with a branching ratio of 64% via a β
emission in 212Po (Qβ = 2.2 MeV) which is again an α emitter with a short half-life of 300 ns. So,
for this two chains a BiPo signature is an electron and a delayed α with a delay time depending
on the isotope contamination we want to measure.

2 Two possible designs

Two designs for the BiPo detector are under study to ﬁnd the best compromise between eﬃciency
and background rejection.

2.1 Design with a tracking detector

The ﬁrst design, which derives the NEMO 3 technology, consists in a tracko-calo planar detector.
The foil to be measured is deposited directly on a horizontal plane of organic plastic scintillator
blocks (20×20 cm2) coupled to low radioactive 5” PMTs. A drift wire chamber, working in
Geiger mode, is installed above the foil. Long plastic scintillator bars, with two sides low
activity PMTs readout, close the upper part of the wire chamber (ﬁgure 2). A BiPo event from
a 212Bi decay is identiﬁed as a track of the electron in the wire chamber associated with a hit in
time in a scintillator bar and a delayed hit within 1 µs (∼3×T1/2 (212Po)) in a lower scintillator
block near the reconstructed vertex. The geometrical eﬃciency is about 25% since it requires
the electron going up and the α going down.

The BiPo events from 214Bi decays is identiﬁed by a delayed α, within 500 µs
(∼3×T1/2 (214Po)), in the tracking device.
It is however diﬃcult to tag this long delayed α
by a delay hit in the lower scintillator block because of a probable too high random coincidence
level within 500 µs.

The advantage of the design with a tracking detector is that it allows to measure 214Bi and
208Tl contaminations from natural radioactive chains with the same device. However, it requires
to build a large gaseous detector and the geometrical eﬃciency is low.

2.2 Design without tracking detector

The second design consists of two thin organic plastic scintillating plates (1 cm thick) with the
source foil sandwiched between this plates. The scintillating plates are polished without any
wrapping in order to collect the scintillation light on the lateral sides by total internal reﬂectivity.
The optical readout is done with low radioactive PMTs (ﬁgure 2). The position of the emission
of scintillation light is reconstructed by the barycenter of the amount of light of each PMT.
An external γ tagger with plastic scintillators surrounds the detector in order to reject external
background. A BiPo event corresponds to a trigger hit in one plate and a delayed hit from
the same location in the same plate or in the second one and no hit in time in the γ tagger.
Let’s notice that the 214Bi measurement will be diﬃcult because of a probable too high random
coincidences level within 500 µs.

This design has the advantage to be compact and to have a large geometrical eﬃciency.

2.3 Ultra thin scintillating optical ﬁbers

The use of ultra thin scintillating optical ﬁbers between the foil to be measured and the scin-
tillators is a very attractive technique for electrons and alphas identiﬁcation. A thickness of
200 µm allows both to contain totally and measure α particles and to tag electrons without
loosing too much energy. This technique allows to reduce strongly the single rate (and so the
random coincidence) and to suppress external γ background. This technique may be adapted
for both previous BiPo designs.

3 Expected sensitivity of the BiPo detector

3.1 α quenching factor

The sensitivity of the BiPo detector is mostly correlated to the capacity of detecting the α
emission. It requires a low energy threshold for α detection in order to be sensitive to the whole
thickness of the source (40 mg/cm2 in case of SuperNEMO foils). Moreover due to the very large
stopping power of α particles, the amount of scintillation light produced by an α is smaller than
the one produced by an electron of the same energy. A scintillation quenching factor Q(Eα) for
α particles depends on the energy of the α and is deﬁned as:

Eα

meas =

Eα
Q(Eα)

.

(1)

The quenching factor, as a function of the energy of the α particles, has been measured
for the plastic scintillators used in BiPo prototype with a dedicated test bench. α particles
of 5.5 MeV have been produced by an 241Am source. Theirs energies have been reduced by
pilling up 6 µm mylar foils between the source and the scintillator. A GEANT 4 simulation
of α particles emitted by 241Am and crossing several foils of mylar has been done in order to
determine the expected α energy spectrum (ﬁgure 3). Then the quenching factor has been
measured by comparing the observed energy with the one of 1 MeV electrons from a 207Bi
source. The result is presented in ﬁgure 3. The quenching factor is about 25 for a 1 MeV α. It
means that the expected energy threshold for electron detection of 40 keV would correspond to
an energy threshold for α detection of 1 MeV.

3.2 Eﬃciency and sensitivity

The eﬃciency of the BiPo detector depends on the capacity for an α to escape the foil. It is thus
function of the thickness of the foil to be measured and the energy threshold of the scintillator.
A GEANT4 Monte Carlo of 8.75 MeV α from 212Po decay, emitted randomly in the volume
of a 82Se foil has been done. Figure 4 shows the probability of these α to escape with an energy
greater than 1 MeV (40 keV energy threshold for electron detection) for diﬀerent thickness of
foil. For a thickness of 40 mg/cm2 (in the case of SuperNEMO foils), the eﬃciency is 25%. This
calculation is done with the hypothesis of bulk contamination. The eﬃciency to tag surface
contamination would be obviously much larger.

Figure 4: Eﬃciency to detect an alpha escaping the foil with energy greater than 1 MeV.

The total eﬃciency of the full BiPo detector without tracking device has been calculated with
a preliminary GEANT4 Monte Carlo. Assuming a thickness of the foil of 40 mg/cm2, an uniform
bulk contamination of 212Bi in the foil and an energy threshold of 40 keV for electrons (1 MeV
for alpha), the total eﬃciency is 6.5%. With a tracking device, the eﬃciency dropped to 2.5%.
This calculation takes into account rejection of the BiPo events in the case of a backscattering
of the electron on one scintillator with a deposited energy above the threshold before hitting the
second scintillator. Such events with two scintillators in time are rejected as candidate of 212Bi
contamination in the scintillators (see below).

With a surface of the detection of 10 m2 (corresponding to 5 kg of 40 mg/cm2 foils to be
measured), and with 1 month of measurement, a level of background of 1 count per month would
correspond to a sensitivity in 208Tl activity of 2 µBq/kg (1µBq/m2). In case of the design with
a tracking device, the sensitivity would be 6 µBq/kg (3µBq/m2).

4 Background

4.1 Origin of the background

The ﬁrst limitation of the BiPo detector is a random coincidence of two scintillation hits within
the 1 µs delay time window. Single counting rate is dominated by Compton electron due to
external γ.
It will be strongly reduced either by the tracking detector or by the external γ
tagger depending on the design of the BiPo detector. Thickness of scintillators must be also as
thin as possible in order to reduce Compton electrons. The use of ultra thin scintillating ﬁber
would also reduce strongly the random coincidence. One of the objective of prototypes is to
demonstrate that the random coincidence will be smaller than 1 count per month for a surface
of measurement of 10 m2.

4

The main source of background mimicking a BiPo (electron, delayed alpha) event is a 212Bi
surface contamination on the entrance surface of the scintillators block in front of the foil as it
is shown in ﬁgure 5. If the deepness of the contamination is small (typically less than 100 µm1),
the electron from the 212Bi beta decay will escape the ﬁrst scintillator and hit the second one
without depositing enough energy to trigger the ﬁrst one. It will appear exactly like a BiPo
event emitted from the foil.

However a bulk 212Bi contamination inside the block of the scintillators is not a source of
background because the emitted electron will ﬁre the scintillators block before escaping and
hitting the second one. The two ﬁred scintillators block will be in time and this background
event will be rejected.

The level of surface purity in 212Bi of the scintillators required for the BiPo detector cannot be
measured with HPGe germanium detectors. So in order to validate the surface radiopurity of the
scintillators and also to validate the technique and the level of random coincidence, prototypes
are under construction.

4.2 Preliminary measurements with NEMO 3 detector

As the technology of the ﬁrst design is the same as NEMO 3 detector, we used it to do some
measurements of the 212Bi contaminations of the plastic scintillators (bulk and surface). To
test the 212Bi contamination of the surface an analysis was done with NEMO 3 data. The
analysis channel was a crossing electron in the wire chamber without counter triggered at the
beginning of the track and a delayed hit in this scintillator. The decay spectrum was well ﬁtted
corresponding to the 300 ns half-life with a measured activity of 150 µBq/m2. This value is to
much for BiPo detector because it corresponds to 400 µBq/kg for 40 mg/cm2 foils. This result
isn’t concluding because in NEMO 3 the scintillators are wrapped with aluminized mylar for
light reﬂectivity. Our hypothesis is that this contamination comes from the standard aluminum
deposited on this mylar. A BiPo prototype is still needed.

The 212Bi bulk contamination of the NEMO 3 scintillators was measured directly on a
NEMO 3 counter with an oscilloscope looking for a PMT signal with a delayed hit within
1 µs. After 3 days no event has been observed. It corresponds to an upper limit on the 212Bi
bulk contamination of the scintillators of A(212Bi) < 3 µBq/kg, in agreement with the BiPo
requirements. This preliminary test will be conﬁrmed with the BiPo-1 prototype (see below).

1The averaged deposited energy of an electron from the 212Bi beta decay calculated with a GEANT4 Monte

Carlo is about 50 keV in 100 µm of plastic scintillator.

5 Prototypes of the BiPo detector

Two prototypes BiPo-1 and BiPo-2 are under construction. The main goal of these prototypes
is to measure the level of background: (i) the level of random coincidence; (ii) the surface
radiopurity of the scintillators.

These two prototypes will be installed in the new Canfranc Underground Laboratory in a
shielding test facility. It consists of a large tight mechanical structure with 10 cm of low active
lead (20 Bq/kg) and a inner layer of 4 cm of pure iron (in order to suppress bremsstrahlung
from the lead shielding). The inner volume of the shielding is 140×140×100 cm3 and will be
ﬂushed with radon free air.

5.1 Prototype BiPo-1

The ﬁrst BiPo-1 prototype (ﬁgure 6), consists of 20 low radioactive capsules made with Plexiglas
or carbon ﬁbers containing two organic plastic scintillators blocks face-to-face coupled with
PMMA optical light guide to 5” low radioactive PMTs (Hamamatsu R6594, 0.7 Bq/PMT total
activity). The size of the scintillator blocks are 20×20×1 cm3. Their entrance surface is covered
with 200 nm of ultra-pure aluminum in order to avoid any scintillation light crosstalk. The
capsules are ﬁlled by pure nitrogen in order to suppress radon and thoron contamination.

in Canfranc.

Surface radiopurity in 212Bi of the entrance surface of the scintillators is measured by looking
for a hit in one PMT and a delayed hit in the second PMT within 2 µs (∼7×T1/2 (212Po))
without any hit in time (bulk contamination) or short delay in within 10 ns (double Compton
from external γ). The large time window allows to distinguish BiPo candidates (up to 1 µs) from
random coincidence (ﬂat distribution). Acquisition of the full prototype will be done with the
MATACQ acquisition board, a very high dynamic range and high sampling rate VME digitizing
ADC board. It is a 4 channel boards with an amplitude resolution of 12 bits, a time range of
2.5 µs, an amplitude range of 1 V and a sampling rate of 2 Gs/s.

A ﬁrst capsule has been installed in Canfranc Underground Laboratory in October, 17th
shielded with only 10 cm of low activity lead and ﬂushed with N2 gas. The single counting rate
was 0.3 Hz with an energy threshold of 60 keV. It has been reduced to about 0.1 Hz by adding
only 1 cm of pure iron between the capsule and the lead, demonstrating that counting rate
is dominated by bremsstrahlung from lead activity. A temporary acquisition with LECROY
WAVERUNNER digital oscilloscope (2.5 GS/s and 8 bit amplitude resolution) has been used.
After 10.7 days of measurement no BiPo event has been observed with the 1 µs delay window

and one event has been observed with a 1.4 µs delay, in agreement with 0.33 count expected
from random coincidence. It corresponds to an upper limit on the surface radiopurity of the
scintillators of A(208Tl) < 60 µBq/m2 (90% C. L.).

In September 2007, 20 capsules will be fully running in the shielding test facility in Canfranc.
One month of measurement will allow to reach the sensitivity for the surface radiopurity of the
scintillators of A(208Tl) < 1 µBq/m2 (90% C. L.), level required for the ﬁnal BiPo detector.
This ﬁrst BiPo-1 prototype could be used as a ﬁrst BiPo detector with a capacity to measure a
surface of 0.8 m2 of double beta foils with a sensitivity of A(208Tl) < 20 µBq/m2 (90% C. L.).

5.2 Prototype BiPo-2
The second BiPo-2 prototype consists of two face-to-face large scintillator plates (75×75 cm2
and 1 cm of thickness). The scintillating plates are polished without any wrapping in order
to collect the scintillation light on the lateral sides by total internal reﬂectivity. The optical
readout is done for each plate on two opposite sides with low radioactive PMTs coupled with
optical light guides. The position of the emission of scintillation light is reconstructed by the
barycentre of the amount of light of each PMT. A gain survey setup done with a LED sent with
optical ﬁbers on each PMT allows to control the stability of the PMTs gains. The plates are
surrounded by a γ tagger.

This prototype will be installed by the fall 2007 in the shielding test facility in Canfranc
with the same ADC boards than for prototype BiPo-1. The objectives of this prototype are:
(i) to validate the spatial resolution of this device, (ii) to measure the level of random co-
incidence depending on the spatial resolution and γ tagger eﬃciency, (iii) the level of surface
radiopurity of the scintillators plates. With two months of measurement, and if the random coin-
cidence is low enough, the expected sensitivity of the prototype BiPo-2 is A(208Tl) < 15 µBq/m2
(90% C. L.).

6 Conclusion

The BiPo detector with its two possible designs, is mainly purposed to the measurement of the
SuperNEMO double beta source foils with a sensitivity of 2 µBq/kg in 208Tl and 10 µBq/kg
in 214Bi. The R&D phase started this year and will be going on for three years with the
development of two prototypes BiPo-1 and BiPo-2. The main goal of these prototypes is to
measure the level of backgrounds dominated by random coincidences and surface radiopurity
of the scintillators. In October, 17th a ﬁrst capsule of the prototype BiPo-1 as been installed
in Canfranc Underground Laboratory. With 10 days of data, a preliminary upper limit on the
surface radiopurity of the scintillators of A(208Tl) < 60 µBq/m2 (90% C. L.) has been obtained.
In September 2007, 20 capsules will be fully running. One month of measurement will allow
to reach the sensitivity for the surface radiopurity of the scintillators of A(208Tl) < 1 µBq/m2
(90% C. L.), level required for the ﬁnal BiPo detector. By the end of 2007, the second design
with scintillator plates will be tested for validation.

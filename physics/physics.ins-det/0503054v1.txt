Abstract

A pellet target produces micro-spheres of diﬀerent materials, which are used as an
internal target for nuclear and particle physics studies. We will describe the pellet
hydrogen behavior by means of ﬂuid dynamics and thermodynamics. In particular
one aim is to theoretically understand the cooling eﬀect in order to ﬁnd an eﬀective
method to optimize the working conditions of a pellet target. During the droplet
formation the evaporative cooling is best described by a multi-droplet diﬀusion-
controlled model, while in vacuum, the evaporation follows the (revised) Hertz–
Knudsen formula. Experimental observations compared with calculations clearly
indicated the presence of supercooling, the eﬀect of which is discussed as well.

sion in hadron physics. The ﬁgure of merit for physics experiments is usually
the (integrated) luminosity, i.e. the target thickness times the particle beam
intensity. For light targets such as hydrogen or deuterium it is quite diﬃcult
to achieve the necessary high luminosity with a conventional gas target. The
alternative of using frozen micro-spheres, so-called pellets, has been suggested
and a prototype pellet-generator was developed by Trostell [1]. A pellet target
avoids unnecessary background gas load to the accelerator ring and allows an
eﬀective target thickness of a few times 1015 atoms/cm2 [2,3]. Since the target
tubes connected to the accelerator ring are rather narrow, detectors can be
placed close to the interaction point in a nearly 4π sr conﬁguration. These par-
ticular characteristics of a pellet target have caused worldwide attention, and
in the near future pellet target facilities are foreseen in J¨ulich, Germany, and
in Lanzhou, China. Furthermore, this kind of target is considered as one of the
main options for the future PANDA experiment [4] at FAIR in Darmstadt,
Germany.

Until now there is only one pellet target facility permanently installed and ac-
tively operated inside a storage-ring accelerator. It is connected to the WASA
(Wide Angle Shower Apparatus) detector at CELSIUS at The Svedberg Lab-
oratory, Uppsala, Sweden. This target has successfully provided hydrogen pel-
lets for experimental data taking since 1999, with deuterium pellets being
produced as well since 2004.

The principle of operating a pellet target has been described elsewhere [1,5],
and here we only brieﬂy review those parts which are of importance for this
work. Compared to the earlier work, we have undertaken more systematic
studies to theoretically understand and optimize the target performance. We
will describe the behavior of a pellet target on the basis of a thermodynamic
analysis. We will further restrict ourselves to hydrogen pellets, but the mech-
anism is similar for deuterium pellets. Data values concerning hydrogen are
taken from Ref. [6], as throughout this work. Concerning the micro-spheres,
the naming convention used in this paper is droplet whenever we talk about
the liquid phase and pellet for the solid phase, while the word micro-sphere
covers both cases as well as the intermediate one.

2 Experimental setup

The pellet-generation system consists of four parts:

(1) a coldhead with heat exchangers, in which pressurized hydrogen gas is

cooled and liquiﬁed,

(2) a droplet formation chamber (DFC), where a glass nozzle together with
an acoustical excitation system produces and breaks-up the jet of liquid

2

hydrogen into uniformly spaced and sized droplets,

(3) a vacuum injection system through which the droplets transform to to-

tally frozen micro-spheres (and hereafter are called pellets), and

(4) a skimmer to collimate the pellet beam.

The hydrogen is cooled by a commercially available two-stage coldhead. At
stage 1, a ﬁrst heat exchanger is mounted to cool the gas to about 50 K. At
stage 2, a second heat exchanger regulates the temperature to 14.1 K. Inside
this latter heat exchanger the gas will be liquiﬁed and brought to the nozzle
directly attached at the exit, as depicted in Fig. 1. The carrier gas, helium,
which is brought to the DFC in a separate channel is also cooled by this heat
exchanger though it will always stay in gas phase.

Fig. 1. A schematic picture of the droplet formation chamber and the vacuum
chamber. The geometry of the DFC is complex but can be approximated by a
cylinder of diameter 22 mm and height 15 mm. The distance between the nozzle
outlet and the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary is 8 mm. The distance between
the outlet of the vacuum injection capillary and the skimmer is 70 cm.

The breakup of the liquid hydrogen jet is a result of the acoustical excita-
tion with axial symmetry induced by the ceramic piezo-electrical transducer
connected to the nozzle (see Fig. 2). The DFC is a stainless steel chamber
with four windows allowing optical observations in both transverse directions,
which enables us to control the droplet formation.

The vacuum injection consists of a 70 mm long capillary, connected to a dif-
ferentially pumped vacuum chamber. Another 70 cm downstream the exit of
the vacuum injection capillary, a collimating skimmer is placed to skim oﬀ
the pellets with too large angular divergence. The collimated pellets will pro-
ceed an additional 1.41 m before they reach the interaction point with the ion
beam. As a last step they are captured by active charcoal inside the cryogenic
beam dump. The mechanical details of this facility can be found in Ref. [1].

3 Operating conditions and measurements

The operating conditions of the pellet target have been developed steadily
over the years. The inner diameter of the nozzle exit has decreased from ini-
tially roughly 17 µm to presently 12 µm, which in turn has resulted in a pellet
diameter decrease from 50 µm to a value of about 30 µm. The rate of hy-
103 s−1
drogen pellets reaching the interaction point has increased from 3
to almost 104 s−1. The optimal working frequency of the transducer is condi-
tionally determined and may vary over a wide range, typically from 60 kHz
to 100 kHz. Nevertheless, for an individual experimental run the working fre-
quency can only change within a quite narrow frequency window. It can only
be determined experimentally by the observations of a “nice” droplet train, a
good micro-sphere survival ratio through the vacuum injection capillary, and
a strong concentration of pellets at the center of the skimmer. In this article,
the logged data from the last hydrogen run in December 2003 were used as
example. The conditions for this run were: a measured distance of 0.368 mm
between two successive droplets in the droplet formation chamber, a trans-
ducer frequency of 102.32 kHz, a nozzle diameter 12.0 µm, a pressure in the
droplet formation chamber of 21.3 mbar, and a driving pressure of 729 mbar
for the injected hydrogen gas.

×

Normally, either cooled hydrogen gas or helium gas at a temperature of about
17 K could be used as the background gas inside the DFC. To get a good
pellet concentration at the skimmer one wants to have as low pressure as
possible in the DFC, otherwise the angular pellet divergence from the vacuum

4

injection becomes too large. If the absolute pressure in the droplet chamber
is too low there is a risk that the liquid jet will degenerate into a spray which
immediately freezes and blocks the jet. This risk has been signiﬁcantly reduced
by the use of helium as background gas. The higher viscosity of helium gives
a more steady gas ﬂow through the vacuum injection capillary. As a result of
this it is possible to have a higher absolute pressure in the DFC and still get a
good concentration at the skimmer. The lower critical temperature of helium
also eliminates the risk that the gas will liquefy in the second heat exchanger.

The ambient gas in the DFC is thus a mixture of two kinds of gases; helium
and the evaporated hydrogen gas. The ﬂow of helium is regulated by the total
DFC pressure. In addition, it was found that when the helium supply was shut
oﬀ, the background gas which only consisted of hydrogen had an equilibrium
pressure of 8 mbar. Thus we assume that in the gas mixture the hydrogen vapor
was also occupying a partial pressure of 8 mbar, and the residue 13 mbar is
21 mbar in the DFC.
ascribed to helium gas for a constant total pressure of

∼

It has been theoretically and experimentally proven that the hydrogen droplets
are fragile because of their rather low surface tension and thus are easily
destroyed by the high-speed gas ﬂow in the vacuum injection capillary while
solid hydrogen-spheres would probably survive the vacuum injection better
[7,8]. To avoid freezing of the liquid jet itself but at the same time enable
the droplets to freeze as soon as possible, the temperature of liquid hydrogen
at the exit of the nozzle is precisely controlled to be a slightly higher than
the normal freezing temperature, Tm = 13.96 K, namely 14.1 K, while the
total pressure, thus also the partial pressure of hydrogen vapor, in the droplet
formation chamber is set to a value much lower than the triple-point pressure
of hydrogen (Ptp = 72 mbar).

both satellites and main droplets.

Pictures (see Fig. 3) of the droplets have been taken in the experiments by a
digital camera with the assistance of a stroboscopic ﬂash diode. The measured
inter-droplet distance λ was 0.368 mm which consequently resulted in a droplet
diameter of Dd = 39.1 µm from Eq. (3). This is also consistent with the
measured value of the ratio λ/Dd ≃
9, when the droplets are just detached
from the jet.

The droplet velocity vd is deduced from vd = λf , where f is the driving
frequency of the transducer. For our case we ﬁnd vd = 37.7 m/s. The observed
relative velocity decrease for droplets is measured to be about 6%, comparing
droplets just detached from the jet to those close to the inlet of the vacuum
injection capillary.

From experimental observations we know that the micro-spheres are in liquid
phase at the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary and completely frozen at
the skimmer. The latter conclusion comes from observing the micro-spheres
that do not pass to really rebounce like billiard balls, i.e. solid objects, as
indicated in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst conclusion arises from tilting the droplet train
to hit the capillary inlet. In this case we do not observe the “egg shells” as
described in Ref. [9] which should have been the result if the micro-spheres
been partially frozen. To conclude our observations, the micro-spheres must
freeze somewhere in between the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary and
the skimmer.

Fig. 4. Shown is the pellet concentration lit by a laser just above the skimmer, visible
as the black cone in the lower part. Its opening diameter is 0.59 mm. We also see
the traces of pellets bouncing around, conﬁrming that they really are solid at this
location, i.e. 70 cm downstream of the outlet of the vacuum injection capillary. The
horizontal pattern comes from the monitor which the photo is taken of. This also
makes the pellet concentration to look signiﬁcantly bigger compared to the original
frames from the CCD camera.

The calculations (see Fig. 6) show that the hydrogen droplets are cooled down
so fast by evaporative cooling that a solid micro-sphere (pellet) or at least a
solid shell at the droplet surface could be formed at the exit of the droplet for-
mation chamber (inlet of vacuum injection capillary). Clearly a phenomenon
called supercooling is inevitably encountered, as has been mentioned before
but not examined in greater detail [1]. It is still not clear how much of the
pellet beam divergence is ascribed to the supercooling, but as mentioned the
pellet survival rate may be deeply aﬀected by this phenomenon.

The gas ﬂow in the vacuum injection capillary will be “choked” due to the
large pressure diﬀerence in the DFC and the vacuum chamber. The droplet
carried by the gas ﬂow will endure a drag force given by Eq. (5) and as a
result the droplet will be accelerated. We have experimentally measured the
average pellet velocity of hydrogen from the pictures of the pellets just after
the vacuum injection capillary. For this particular run, the average over 52
distances together with the transducer frequency resulted in a pellet velocity
of 94 m/s. For other runs, the typical values range from 60 m/s to 100 m/s
dependent on the pressure in the DFC and the driving pressure of hydrogen
gas to the nozzle. At the moment the distribution of the pellet velocity is
unknown, but we will report on these experiments in a forthcoming paper.

A crucial topic originating from the vacuum injection is the pellet beam di-
vergence which causes about 80 percent of the produced hydrogen pellets to
be skimmed oﬀ because of their too large angular spread, i.e. most of them
never reach the interaction point. The origin of this type of divergence is not
known in detail [10].

Pellet beam proﬁles measurements were carried out by step-wise moving the
pellet beam over the skimmer aperture while counting the ones that pass. The
results are shown in Fig. 5. A priori the shape of the uncollimated beam, i.e.
before the skimmer, is unknown. However, by ﬁtting several test-functions to
the experimental results a Gaussian shape reproduces the measured values
the best. Since the size of the pellet beam is similar to the skimmer diam-
eter, the convolution between the two becomes important. We assumed the
uncollimated beam to be a symmetric Gaussian, and by ﬁtting its convoluted
result to the experimental measurements the “real” pellet beam proﬁle, with
a FWHM of 1.04 mm, was obtained.

From comparing the total number of pellets in the uncollimated beam to the
transducer frequency, a survival ratio of 50% was deduced. This rather low
number is also supported from the photos taken just below the vacuum injec-
tion capillary. They indeed show that the inter-pellet distance is sometimes
twice the distance of others. Thus a pellet in such a case is “missing”.

4 Interpretation of the results

4.1 Droplet formation

It is well known that pressurized liquid ejected from a nozzle will form a jet.
A cylinder of jet is dynamically unstable under the action of surface ten-
sion. When a vibration of a certain frequency is applied to the nozzle the
corresponding wavelength λ will force the jet to disintegrate into a stream
of uniform-sized droplets. From Lord Rayleigh’s analysis the disturbance to
the shape of the droplets grows most rapidly at an approximate wavelength
of λ = 4.5Djet, where Djet is the diameter of the jet [11,12]. In our case
the working frequency has to be set at a much lower frequency than this
optimal one to avoid the coalescence eﬀect causing clustering in the high-
frequency mode. We have observed experimentally, like others [13] also have,
that satellite droplets are inevitably formed accompanying the main droplets,
quite independent of the experimental conﬁguration. However, we can tune
the transducer frequency slightly so that the satellite droplets could merge
into the main droplets as quickly as possible due to their diﬀerent velocities.
For details of the nozzle unit, see Fig. 2.

4.1.1 Droplet size determination

To determine the droplet size one needs to know the jet diameter. However,
the small jet size for a 12-µm nozzle in a cryogenic environment is diﬃcult to

8

be measured directly. We apply ﬂuid dynamics to overcome this problem.

In ﬂuid dynamics the Reynolds number, deﬁned as Re = ρvnozDnoz/µ, is used
to distinguish between diﬀerent types of ﬂows. Here, ρ is the density of liquid
hydrogen, v is the ﬂuid velocity, and µ is the dynamic viscosity. When Re .
2000 the ﬂow is always laminar, and when Re > 4000 it is always turbulent
[10]. For a 12.0 µm inner-diameter nozzle we get Re
36v for hydrogen,
which means that in order to have a laminar ﬂow the hydrogen ﬂuid must
have a velocity . 55 m/s. This is indeed the case, because of the discussion in
Sec. 4.1.2, resulting in a Reynolds number of about 1000.

≃

Most of the pressure drop between the driving pressure and the much lower
pressure in the droplet formation chamber will take place near the exit of the
nozzle, where the narrowing of the pipe system becomes signiﬁcant.

Using the equations of continuity and momentum conservation, we can easily
ﬁnd that for laminar ﬂow the mean velocity of the liquid ﬂuid inside the nozzle
(¯vnoz) and the velocity of jet (vjet) are related as [14]

The corresponding relationship between the diameter of the ﬂuid inside the
nozzle and the diameter of the jet is given by

vjet =

¯vnoz.

(1)

(2)

To summarize: for the present nozzle with a 12-µm inner diameter we expect
a laminar ﬂow inside the nozzle and the jet size to be 10.4 µm.

It has been further derived that in turbulent ﬂow case the ratio between the
diameter of the jet and inner diameter of nozzle (Djet/Dnoz) will be less than
0.866 if we solve the momentum-conservation equation with the velocity distri-
bution of turbulent ﬂow. This could explain why the experimental measured
values of this ratio by other authors are somewhat smaller (e.g. a value of
approximately 0.80 was given by Ref. [15]).

The unstable jet will break up into droplets due to the acoustic excitation. Af-
ter the satellite droplets merge into the main droplet, the volume conservation
gives [15]

where vd is the droplet velocity, and σ is the surface tension of hydrogen liquid.

Now that the droplet velocity was 37.7 m/s, we can trace back to the jet
velocity and obtain vjet = 37.9 m/s. Recalling the relationship between the jet
velocity and the ﬂuid velocity inside the nozzle, Eq. (1), numerically, the ﬂuid
velocity at the exit of the nozzle was 28.4 m/s, thus less than 55 m/s to fulﬁl
the requirements of laminar ﬂow (see Sec. 4.1.1).

When the droplet travels in the surrounding of gas mixture, the gas actually
acts as a viscous ﬂuid and exert a frictional drag force on it. For an isolated
spherical droplet, based on Newton’s resistance law, the general expression for
the drag force in a gas surrounding can be written as [17]

FD =

ρgD2

rel/Cc

Here CD is the drag factor, which has diﬀerent forms for diﬀerent regions of
the Reynolds number of the droplet, Red = ρgvrelDd/µg. Further, ρg is the gas
density, µg is the gas viscosity, Cc is Cunningham non-continuum correction
(which is almost 1.0 in our case because we are working in the continuum
region, see Sec. 4.1.3.1), Ad is the cross sectional area of the droplet, i.e.
Ad = πD2
d/4, and vrel is the relative velocity between the droplet and the
surrounding gas. Since the gas in the droplet formation chamber can only be
pumped away via a 0.8 mm narrow vacuum injection capillary, this limits gas
ﬂow such that the resulted bulk gas velocity in the droplet formation chamber
is insigniﬁcantly small. Therefore the background gas in the DFC could be
assumed as stagnant and the relative velocity vrel to equal the droplet velocity
vd. It should be kept in mind that the surrounding gas is actually a mixture
of hydrogen vapor and helium gas, and the density is the linear combination
of speciﬁc volumes, while the viscosity is deduced according to the summing
rule of Wilke [18].

For a hydrogen droplet with a velocity of 37.7 m/s, the Reynolds number is
Red=34.4. Relevant values for the background H2-He gas at 17 K were calcu-
10−6 Pa s. The hydrogen data for
lated to ρg = 0.049 kg/m3 and µg = 2.1
this calculation were taken from Ref. [6]. The drag factor equation suitable

When the droplet passes through the DFC its diameter changes very little,
so as a ﬁrst order of estimation we can assume that the droplet diameter is
constant. The numerical calculations of Eq. (7) show that the relative velocity

loss (1
distance inside the DFC (assuming the jet length in Fig. 1 to be 1 mm). Here
v0
d is the initial droplet velocity (37.7 m/s). The observed relative velocity loss
for droplets is only about 6% from the photos, which is just one-third of the
above value for an isolated droplet. The diﬀerence may be explained by the
eﬀect of inter-droplet interactions within the droplet train, which means that
a succeeding droplet in the wake of a proceeding droplet will endure less drag
force [19]. Further eﬀects of the inter-droplet interaction will be discussed in
the next section.

4.1.3 Thermodynamic behavior of the droplet

The mass loss due to evaporation and the connected temperature develop-
ment of the droplet can only be achieved by solving the appropriate thermo-
dynamic equations of the droplet in the DFC. Many theoretical models exist
to describe the heat and mass transfer processes from micro-droplets [20,21]
to the surrounding for single isolated droplets. However, these models are of
limited beneﬁt in the case of a droplet train where the inter-droplet separation
distance is so small that droplet-droplet interactions become signiﬁcant. The
intensity of interactions can be deﬁned in terms of an interaction parameter
which is the ratio between the rate of a transfer process from a droplet in an
array compared to that from a single isolated droplet. Because the heat and
mass transfer behave very similar, we can reasonably assume that the inter-
action parameters for heat and mass transfer rates are equal, and deﬁned as
[22]

(8)

which is the ratio between the mass loss of a droplet in a linear array (train)
relative to that from a single isolated droplet. The parameter η depends only

on the dimension-less spacing between the droplets which is deﬁned as ǫ = λ/a,
where a is the droplet radius. From other experiments it has been reported
that the inter-droplet interactions are signiﬁcant (η
0.3) for ǫ < 7.0 but
negligible for ǫ > 20 [22,23]. In our case ǫ = 18.8, so we have assumed η to be
about 0.8.

4.1.3.1 Mass loss equation Once a droplet is formed, we assume it to
(i) represent all other droplets; (ii) be totally spherical; (iii) enter a uniform
environment with respect to pressure and temperature; and (iv) be surrounded
by its own evaporating gas in a quasi-steady equilibrium state at the liquid
surface so that the gas pressure follows the saturation line [6]

where PS is given in Pa if the dimension of the surface temperature Ts is K. The
heat and mass transfer process depends on the degree of rarefaction for the
system, which is represented by the dimensionless Knudsen number deﬁned as
Kn = lmfp/Dd [24]. Here, lmfp is the mean free path, i.e. the average distance
between molecule collisions, and Dd is the droplet diameter. The ambient gas
is a mixture of helium and hydrogen, so in the simple kinetic gas theory (with
the approximation of rigid spheres) the mean free path is [25]

at the “diﬀusion-controlled continuum or near-continuum limit” the evapora-
tion is best predicted by a diﬀusion-controlled model if the concentration of
the inert gas is neither too large nor tending to zero when compared to the
evaporated gas. In our case the partial pressures of helium and hydrogen are
of the same order and hence a diﬀusion-controlled model should be adequate.

coeﬃcient of gas mixture Dαβ can be deduced from the kinetic theory as
shown in Ref. [25]. We have also inserted the earlier discussed η-factor to take
inter-droplet eﬀects into account.

Since the droplet is non-stationary the mass transfer must be multiplied by
a factor, the Sherwood number, due to the forced convection. Under the as-
sumption of a negligible internal circulation inside the droplet, as has been
experimentally investigated in a similar setup and concluded to be reasonable
[28], the Sherwood number for mass transfer is given by [29]

4.1.3.3 Droplet temperature results With these mass and heat trans-
fer equations, the behavior of the hydrogen droplet can be obtained using an
updated program version with the numerical iteration method as used earlier
in Ref. [30]. With an initial droplet diameter of 39.1 µm, a velocity of 37.7 m/s,
and a temperature of 14.1 K, we see in Fig. 6 the droplet temperature evolu-
tion in the DFC for diﬀerent cases. Our ambient pressure was 21.3 mbar with
a partial hydrogen pressure of 8 mbar. The background gas temperature was
assumed to be 17 K, however, the variation of this value was shown to be neg-
ligible. To simplify the calculation, the density change which takes place at
the transition between the liquid and solid phase (about 12%), was neglected
and instead an average value was used.

When no supercooling occurs, liquid hydrogen transforms to solid at Tm =
13.96 K and this happens for the surface of the droplet already after 2.5
×
10−8 s. Assuming a smooth inward-directed freezing process, the whole micro-
sphere would turn solid at 0.24 ms corresponding to a ﬂight path of 10 mm
about 3 mm into the vacuum injection capillary. This does not correspond
to our experimental observations, because before a solid pellet is formed the
micro-sphere should be partially frozen and thus fragments of frozen hydro-
gen should be visible if the nozzle and thereby the droplet train is tilted to
hit the capillary inlet. Those fragments have never been observed and there-
fore we conclude that an additional mechanism must be present. One distinct
possibility is the presence of supercooling resulting in the corresponding tem-
perature lines in Fig. 6. To simulate supercooling for the hydrogen droplet, we
have assumed that all thermodynamic parameters of liquid hydrogen can be
extrapolated to the temperatures lower than the normal melting temperature.
If not stated otherwise, the droplet train eﬀect is η = 0.8 and the number
of layers, to account for the radial temperature distribution from Eq. (14), is
50. We see that changing η to 1.0 (no eﬀect) make almost no diﬀerence. More
surprisingly is, maybe, the small diﬀerence between the droplet with constant
temperature distribution (distillation limit model) and the ﬁnite-conductivity
model as described above.

4.1.3.4 Nucleation rate of hydrogen Generally, the reason for super-
cooling is that the crystallization has no place to take root and the molecular
motion prevents the substance from freezing. The temperature Tn at which a
droplet of volume Vd will start to freeze, is determined by the relation [38,39]

where τ is the lifetime of the supercooled droplet before freezing. Eq. (22)
has been experimentally investigated for parahydrogen (p-H2) and, to some

To turn back to normal hydrogen we use the results of Ref. [34] where it is

pointed out that the nucleation rate for n-H2 was measured to be
higher than that of p-H2, possibly due to the “onset of rotational ordering
in the solid phase”. From this and Eqs. (23), (24), and (25) the approximate
nucleation rates for n-H2 can be obtained, see Tab. 1.

∼

39 µm-diameter droplet the volume is 3

10−8 cm3. According to
For a
Eq. (22) and values from Tab. 1, the needed droplet temperature is 9.8 K for
the nucleation to start inside the DFC at about 0.19 ms. As seen in Fig. 6 this
temperature will never be reached, not even if the DFC was extended to several
decimeters. In fact, the lowest droplet temperature of 10.8 K corresponds to

×

16

a nucleation rate which is 11 orders of magnitude to low for a nucleation
trigger. Given that the nucleation rate may have a large uncertainty, this
huge order anyway points to that freezing in the DFC is impossible because
the droplet is not “supercooled enough” to experience a phase transition to
solid. Besides, if we consider the supercooling-case for the droplet center and
surface temperature, respectively, i.e. the dashed and solid lines in Fig. 6,
at the correspondent time for the inlet of the vacuum injection capillary, we
actually have Tc = 13.6 K and Ts = 11.2 K. That is greater than 10.8 K and
thus an even lower nucleation rate.

In the calculations we have changed all related working parameters, such as
the vapor pressure, the background gas pressure, and the background gas
temperature. It is found that only when the pressures of vapor and background
gas have been decreased to as low as 3 mbar and 10 mbar, respectively, the
droplet can ﬁnally reach 9.8 K in the DFC. This will however be very hard
to achieve experimentally since the hydrogen vapor pressure results from the
evaporation mechanism itself and the pumping power in the DFC is limited
by the narrow vacuum injection capillary.

To trigger the nucleation and thereby the freezing other means are needed. A
controlled introduction of impurities might be the solution, e.g. as mentioned
in Ref. [32] by heating a ﬁne tungsten ﬁlament such that impurities at the
surface are boiled oﬀ to imply a heterogenous crystallization. Or, maybe su-
personic excitation can be used to decrease the degree of supercooling even
further [36], and thereby increase the nucleation rate.

4.2 Pellet evaporation

Consider the possibility that the micro-spheres are still in liquid phase after
they have passed the vacuum injection capillary. Using liquid parameters in
the equations to come, it turns out that the droplet will reach a temperature
well below 9.8 K within 0.5 ms, almost independent of chosen diameter or
initial temperature. From the discussions on nucleation rate we thus conclude
that if the droplet does not transform to a pellet inside the vacuum injection
capillary, it will do that within some centimeters afterwards. Therefore all
equations in vacuum are subscripted p for pellets.

1),
In vacuum the pellet will evaporate in the molecular ﬂow regime (Kn
and the evaporation rate is given by the (classical) Hertz–Knudsen formula.
However, a revised version also takes the bulk velocity of the vapor in vacuum
into account [37], such that

The main heat source in the vacuum chamber, i.e. after the injection capillary,
is the thermal radiation from the walls of the vacuum pipe. The pellets are
exposed to the wall surface with a temperature of about 298 K. On the ba-
sis of the Stefan–Boltzmann law combined with Kirchhoﬀ’s law, the thermal
radiation can be written as

where kp is the thermal conductivity of the pellet and hsub is the latent heat

with that in the droplet formation chamber, i.e. Eq. (14) with the boundary
conditions Eqs. (15) and (16), but for which all involved parameters should
be interchanged to those of solid hydrogen.

Once the pellet is formed, we can assume that the initial temperature of the
pellet will be equal to the triple point temperature 13.96 K when they are just
consolidated from supercooled droplets. Of course other values are in principle
possible, but due to the rapid temperature decrease the chosen temperature
is really not of importance. The mass loss and temperature evolution can be
calculated by solving the mass transfer and heat balance, i.e. Eqs. (14), (26),
and (29). The results are shown below in Figs. 7 and 8. It turns out that pellets
will cool down to about 6 K within 10 cm of travel in the vacuum chamber. As
seen the lines overlap for the diﬀerent cases. The relative mass loss during this
process is about 14%. After that, i.e. on the way down to the skimmer and
further to the interaction point, the pellet mass loss rate will be maintained at
a rather low constant value. This is very important for a pellet target operation
inside the vacuum of a storage ring which should not be spoiled.

5 Summary

We have described how uniform spaced and sized droplets are formed in the
droplet formation chamber by an acoustical excitation method. From experi-
mental observations we know that the micro-spheres are in liquid phase at the
inlet of the vacuum injection capillary and completely frozen at the skimmer.
Thus they must freeze in between. In the absence of supercooling the calcu-

lations show that they would be only partially frozen at the capillary inlet,
in contradiction to the observations. However, with supercooling present the
experimental observations can be explained. Our calculations show that the
nucleation rate is 11 orders of magnitude too low to trigger a pellet freezing
at all. It is desirable to achieve frozen pellets within the DFC, and therefore
the introduction of impurities or the usage of supersonic excitation should be
considered. The expected advantage of pellets formed at an earlier stage is an
improvement of the survival ratio, and thus better working conditions for a
pellet target.

The total relative mass loss from the formation of droplets to pellets in the
10% decrease
reaction chamber is estimated to be 30%, corresponding to a
in diameter. The pellet size itself is actually further decreased due to the
density change for hydrogen from liquid to solid. As for an original droplet
with a diameter of 39 µm, the ﬁnal pellet size is expected to be about 33 µm.

∼

With the current setup, the droplets freeze to pellets either in the vacuum
injection capillary or a few centimeters afterwards. In either case, the pellet
equilibrium temperature of about 6 K is reached within 10 cm after the cap-
illary. Our calculations show that the mass loss has converged to an almost
constant value at this point. The mass loss results in an unwanted gas load.
Most of the gas load will come from the mass lost during those 10 cm as well
as from the skimmed oﬀ pellets eventually breaking up and evaporating in
the vacuum chamber above. However, this gas load can be pumped away by
appropriate vacuum pumps before and after the skimmer. Thus the gas load
to consider for the vacuum system of the storage ring in which the target is
installed, really originates from the converged value of the mass loss. For our
pellet target this mass loss is between 1.5 and 1.9 ng/s per pellet.

I. THE SLAC B-FACTORY

S INCE 1999, the asymmetric B factory at the Stanford Lin-

ear Accelerator Center (SLAC) is colliding 9.0 GeV elec-
trons with 3.1 GeV positrons. This total energy of 10.58 GeV
corresponds to the Υ (4S) resonance. Its decay particles, B+B−
and B0B0 pairs, are used to study CP violation and many other
processes in particle physics. The data are collected by the
BABAR Detector (Figs. 1 and 2), which is described in detail
in Ref. [1].

the back of
each crystal two photo diodes and one pre-ampliﬁer card are
attached (Fig. 3 right). On average, the diodes see about 7,300
photo-electrons/ MeV. The electronics covers the signal with
an 18-bit dynamic range by combining the output of a 10-
bit ADC with two range bits. This allows the calorimeter to
measure photon energies from 20 MeV to 8 GeV. The energy
and position resolution was determined to be the following [2]:

II. ELECTROMAGNETIC CALORIMETER OVERVIEW

The electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) consists of 6580
CsI(Tl) crystals 16 to 17.5 radiation lengths deep (Fig. 3 left),

Department of Energy grant DE-FG05-91ER40622.
J.M. Bauer is with the University of Mississippi.

The operation of the calorimeter is very stable. Out of
6580 crystals, only one crystal is dead with no hope for any
recovery. Currently four more crystals are dead, but they might
be recovered at some time. Fourteen more crystals use only one
of the two diodes; several more crystals are working incorrectly
in one energy range, for example at low energy. From time

interpolations between these two extremes following a function
linear in the logarithm of the energy.

A. Liquid Source System

Whenever a liquid source calibration is performed, a neu-
tron generator is switched on to emit 14 MeV neutrons. The
generator is surrounded by Fluorinert (FC77), a liquid rich in
ﬂuorine, and the following chain results in the emission of
6.13 MeV photons through the decay of 16N with a half-life
time of 7 seconds:

A system of pipes transports the radioactive liquid past the
front of the crystals. There the photons enter the crystals and
are detected with the regular data acquisition system. Figure 7
shows the spectrum of these photons as seen by a crystal in the

to time an ADC board becomes noisy, which, in the worst
case, results in the crystals of this board being masked out
until the board can be replaced during the next access to the
detector. The electronics is regularly calibrated by determining
the pedestals and by injecting a known charge into the pre-
ampliﬁers to measure the gain and linearity of the system (see
also Ref. [3]).

IV. CALIBRATION OF INDIVIDUAL CRYSTALS

The individual response of a crystal to deposited energy,
namely its overall light yield and its non-uniformity in the light
output (the dependence on the location of the shower inside
the crystal), depends on the details at time of manufacture
and the shape of the crystal. The light output also decreases
over time due to radiation damage. Each crystal of the BABAR
calorimeter is therefore regularly calibrated. Two absolute
energy calibrations are employed for this: The liquid source
calibration at low energy and the Bhabha calibration at high

calorimeter. Calibrations are performed about once a month to
0.5% and a systematic uncertainty
a statistical uncertainty of
of about 0.1%. The average loss in light yield over time due
to radiation damage as measured by the liquid source system
is documented in Fig. 8. Radiation measurements by RadFETs
located at the calorimeter indicate that the average radiation

calculated up to once a month, but will soon be obtained more
frequently once the code is running automatically as part of the
regular reconstruction system. The constants change over time
in a way similar to the source calibration constants (Fig. 9).

V. CLUSTER CALIBRATIONS

Not only calibrations of individual crystals are needed, but
also calibrations of the clusters, which are groups of adjacent
crystals in which the full shower energy of a particle is
deposited. These corrections adjust for shower energy lost at
the rear of the crystals, gaps between the crystals, and the sides
of the calorimeter.

For clusters with energies up to 2 GeV, the calibration is
obtained from π0 mesons by correcting the photon energies
so that the distribution of the invariant mass of two photons
agrees with the expected π0 mass distribution. Corrections are
mostly in the 6% to 8% range. Figure 10 shows a typical m(γγ)
distribution with a clear π0 peak. An improved version of the
calibration is currently being tested.

B. Bhabha Calibration

The second absolute energy calibration of individual crystals
is performed with e+e−
e+e− events from regular recorded
data. These calibrations involve crystal energies of 2.5 GeV to
8 GeV, depending on the polar angle due to the asymmetry
in the beam energies. The calibration requires most crystals to
have at least 200 direct hits in order to reach a statistical error of
0.35% for individual crystals. The systematic error is estimated

For clusters with energies above 2 GeV, the correction factors

be introduced.

VI. IMPROVEMENTS IN RECONSTRUCTION SOFTWARE

A. Position of Cluster Inside Crystals

When matching a track to a cluster of the calorimeter, the
position of the cluster in three dimensions has to be known.
Until recently, this position of the cluster center was always
the front of the crystals. This caused less than
located at
optimal performance of the matching algorithm, such as when
a low-energy track, spiraling in the magnetic ﬁeld of the
detector, enters the calorimeter at an angle. Now all clusters
are assumed to be located at a depth of 12.5 cm inside the
crystals. Figure 11 displays the improvement in the matching
by showing the azimuthal angle difference of the matched
tracks and clusters before and after this change. Similarly,
the track-matching efﬁciency improved, especially at very low
momentum (Fig. 12).

positrons. The plot is based on actual data with requirements that select a clean

simulation with measured photon energy Ecal between 0.5 GeV and 0.8 GeV.

B. Edge Correction

If a photon hits the calorimeter at a position close to the
edge between two crystals, up to 3% of its energy is lost in
gaps, as can be seen from Figs. 13 and 14. A correction is
now applied to the energy of each cluster. The effect of this
so-called “edge correction” on physics analyses can be seen
from the distributions in Fig. 15. The quantity plotted is ∆E,
the difference between the measured energy of a B meson
candidate minus the known beam energy. Without measurement
uncertainties, the peak would be exactly at zero. The underlying

VIII. CONCLUSION

REFERENCES

The BABAR electromagnetic calorimeter operates very reli-
ably and delivers very good performance for the experiment.
The damage to the crystals due to radiation is regularly mea-
sured and calibrated out. Over time, enhancements were added
to the reconstruction code, and the tweaking of the calibrations
continues in order to improve the reconstruction of the detected
particles and ultimately improve the physics analyses of BABAR.

Abstract

A novel modular high-resolution charged-particle tracking detector design using 250µm diameter, round, scintillating
ﬁbers and SiPM arrays for readout is presented. The ﬁber modules consist of 8 layers of 128 ﬁbers, mechanically
stabilized by a carbon ﬁber / Rohacell foam structure. A prototype using scintillating ﬁbers with a diameter of 300µm
and two types of silicon photomultipliers has been tested in a 10GeV proton beam in late October 2006 at the T9
PS-beamline, CERN. We present the measured spatial resolution, eﬃciency and signal-over-noise for this setup. The
advantage of this tracker concept is a compact and modular design with low material budget and only little or no
cooling requirements depending on the quality of the silicon photomultiplieres.

1. Introduction

The idea to use scintillating ﬁbers for charged-
particle tracking is not new. Several experiments
have already successfully built and used scintillat-
ing ﬁber trackers in high-energy and astro-particle
physics. The DØ experiment [1] for example chose
to use a scintillating ﬁber tracker built from 835µm
thick, multi-clad scintillating ﬁbers, read out by
Visible-Light Photon Counters (VLPC). The MICE
experiment took the idea of a scintillating ﬁber
tracker one step further, using 350µm thin mul-
ticlad ﬁbers, also read out by VLPCs. The use of
VLPCs requires a signiﬁcant overhead, because
they have to be operated in cryostats at temper-
atures of around 7K. We therefore propose a new
detector design, using 250µm thin ﬁbers, read out
by Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) that can be
used very eﬀectively with only moderate cooling.

2. Silicon Photomultipliers

A SiPM is a relatively new kind of multipixel
semiconductor photodiode that achieves a high in-
trinsic gain by being operated above its breakdown
voltage[3]. SiPMs have a high photodetection eﬃ-

ciency of up to 65%, exceeding that of regular pho-
tomultiplier tubes. In addition, they scale to small
dimensions, allowing for a compact readout of thin
scintillating ﬁbers.

Major distributors of SiPM are Hamamatsu[4],
Japan and Photonique[5], Switzerland. Pho-
tonique SiPM of type SSPM-0606EXP and SSPM-
050701GR were used during the beamtest of a
SciFi/SiPM tracker prototype.

depending on the bias voltage

SiPM from Photonique reach the peak sensitivity
at around 600nm (see ﬁg. 1). The type SSPM-
050701GR has a very high internal gain greater
than 106 while showing a dark count rate of around
1M Hz at room temperature and about 200kHz
at −10◦C at the recommended operating voltage
of typically 41V . Its photodetection eﬃciency at
494nm is 25% (see ﬁg. 2). The type Photonique
SSPM-0606EXP, which does not have any protec-
tive epoxy layers on top of the device, exhibits a
photodetection eﬃciency of about 40% at a pixel
density of 556 pixels per mm2. The gain of the
SSPM-0606EXP device is about 3 · 105. The noise
of this device is about 5 times higher than that of
the SSPM-050701GR device.

The Hamamatsu model MPPC S10361-025U has
an extremely high pixel density of 1600/mm2. The
resulting low geometrical ﬁll factor of 37% signiﬁ-
cantly limits the photodetection eﬃciency to about
25% at 494nm. Hamamatsu also oﬀers a model
S10361-100U with only 100 pixels per mm2 and
a geometrical ﬁll factor close to 80% that oﬀers a
photodetection eﬃciency of 65%[4]. The dark noise
rate of the tested Hamamatsu MPPC S10361-025U
is 300kHz at 21◦C and around 20kHz at −20◦C.

3. Beamtest of the ﬁrst Prototype

The prototype (see ﬁg. 3) consisted of 300µm ×
300µm square, multiclad ﬁbers of type Bicron[6]
BCF-20 with white EMA coating and Photonique
SiPMs of type SSPM-050701GR and of type SSPM-

0606EXP. The peak emission wavelength of BCF-20
ﬁbers is at 492nm, matching the peak sensitivity of
Photonique SSPM-0606EXP SiPM (see ﬁg. 1).

The scintillating ﬁbers were arranged in two rib-
bons of 3 × 10 ﬁbers. The ﬁber ribbons were sta-
bilized using glue as an adhesive. Both ends of the
3-ﬁber ribbons were glued into a plastic connector
and polished. One end was connected to a SiPM by
mounting it into a copper block and held in place by
a aluminum frame and a spring. The SiPM’S were
mounted into the copper-block to allow for a tem-
perature control. Part of the beam test the opposing
end of the ﬁbers was covered by a reﬂective foil to
increase the light output for the SiPMs.

A beam telescope with four silicon strip modules
from the CMS tracker project was used to measure
the position of the incident particles. The silicon
modules had a strip pitch of 113..139µm and an in-
trinsic resolution of about 40µm [7].

Four scintillator counters, two in front of and two
behind the prototype provided the trigger with a
halo counter as a veto.

The beamtest of the prototype took place in a
10GeV proton beam at PS, CERN. During the

beamtest, 1.5 million events were recorded and
about 800,000 particle tracks were reconstructed
with the beam telescope. The position of each ﬁber
column was determined by reconstructing the posi-
tion of particles that produced a high signal within
the ﬁber (see ﬁg. 4). The average measured distance
between two ﬁber columns was 309µm with a preci-
sion of 10µm. The spatial resolution for particles of
perpendicular incidence that pass through all three
ﬁbers of one ﬁber column was about 90µm which
matches the expected intrinsic resolution of

Knowing the positions of the ﬁbers, we deter-
mined the average photoelectron yield for particles

that passed through one of the ﬁber columns. For
particles with perpendicular incidence the average
photoelectron yield for both types of SiPM with and
without reﬂective foil on the opposing ﬁber end was
measured. The SSPM-050701GR signal was about
2.2 photoelectrons without and 3.5 photoelectrons
with reﬂective foil (see ﬁg. 5). The SSPM-0606EXP
achieved an average photoelectron yield of 3.8 with-
out reﬂective foil and 5.8 with reﬂective foil (omit-
ting one SiPM that actually showed a reduced pho-
toelectron yield after adding the reﬂective foil).

The measured signal-to-noise ratio was about
20 for the SSPM-0606EXP with reﬂective foil and
about 100 for the SSPM-050701GR with reﬂective
foil. The mean eﬃciency for perpendicular inci-
dence, setting a cut at 0.5 photoelectrons, was 96%
for the ribbon read out by the SSPM 0606EXP and
91% for the SSPM 050701GR.

4. Tracker Module Design

The tracker design is modular. It consists of sev-
eral layers of tracker modules, each module consist-
ing of 8 layers of scintillating ﬁbers with 128 ﬁbers
in every layer. 4 layers of ﬁbers are glued to each side
of a module core that consists of 5mm thick Roha-
cell foam covered by 100µm thin carbon ﬁber skins
on either side of the module (see ﬁg. 6). Neighboring
layers are shifted by one half of the ﬁber pitch with
respect to each other to improve the spatial resolu-
tion.

11◦ for the PEBS geometry.

5. Conclusion

The testbeam results indicate that this concept
for a high-resolution SciFi/SiPM tracker is techni-
cal feasible. The average yield of 6 photoelectrons
with a reﬂective foil on one ﬁber end and the SSPM-
0606EXP SiPM matched our requirements. SiPMs
with a reduced pixel density and a 50% higher PDE
are already commercially available from Hama-
matsu. Furthermore the light output from scintil-
lating ﬁbers can be improved by 20% − 40% using
ﬁbers without white coating as measurements with
diﬀerent ﬁber coatings conducted for the CREAM
experiment have shown[9]. Up to now we have not
engineered the optical coupling between ﬁbers and
SiPM’s at all.

A spatial resolution as good as 40µm is in prin-
ciple possible, depending on the granularity of the
readout, the quality of the SiPM’s, the qualtity of
the optical coupling of the ﬁbers to the SiPM’s and
the type of ﬁbers used. With the understanding and
technology we have today, an average spatial reso-
lution of 60µm is expected.

width from testbeam data and Monte Carlo simulations.
Testbeam data obtained with a ﬁber bundle without reﬂec-
tive foil and Photonique SSPM-050701GR SiPM readout are
plotted using square markers. Results from Monte Carlo sim-
ulations are added to study the behavior for improved photo
electron yields. A yield of 5.8 photo electrons was reached
in the testbeam with SSPM-0606EXP SiPMs and reﬂective
foil, but only data at 0◦ were taken in this conﬁguration.

SiPM arrays with a sensitive area of 8mm × 1mm
and 32 readout channels, each channel covering an
area of 0.25mm × 1mm are used for column-wise
ﬁber readout. The SiPM arrays are mounted on al-
ternating ends of the ﬁber modules along with an in-
tegrated preampliﬁer and digitization solution. The
opposing ends of the ﬁbers are covered by a reﬂec-
tive coating.

A dedicated Monte Carlo simulation, again using
the Geant4 package, has been developed for compar-
ison to and generalization of the testbeam results.
A key question to be answered was the spatial res-
olution obtained with a ﬁber module as a function
of the mean photo electron yield np.e. of the ﬁbre-
SiPM chain. Figure 7 shows the result. The spatial
resolution σy′ is plotted for diﬀerent values of np.e.
and depending on the angle α of incidence of a par-
ticle, projected into the bending plane of the mag-
net. σy′ is the resolution along the axis perpendic-
ular to the ﬁbers. Since the beam telescope used in
the testbeam measured the coordinate y perpendic-
ular the direction of incidence z, σy′ is calculated
from the measured σy and the positioning accuracy
σz = 10 µm as follows:

σy′ = σy cos α ⊕ σz sin α

beam, a spatial resolution of 72 µm is obtained at

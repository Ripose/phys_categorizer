Abstract

Standard as well as irradiated silicon pixel detectors developed for the ATLAS ex-
periment were tested in a beam. Digital and analog resolutions were determined
comparing the positions measured by a microstrip telescope and by the pixel detec-
tor. Digital resolutions of 10 µm and analog resolutions of 6 µm (before irradiation)
and 10 µm (after irradiation) are obtained without subtracting the error on the
position determined by the telescope.

Key words: Spatial resolution. Silicon pixel detectors. Radiation hardness.

1 Introduction

The ATLAS Pixel sensors [1,2] con-
sist of n+ implants on a high resis-
tivity n-bulk substrate which turns
p-type after irradiation. The pixel di-
400 µm2. Results
mensions are 50
×
on three diﬀerent sensor designs are
presented here: one with p-stop iso-
lation between pixels [3], one with
p-spray isolation [4] and one with
p-spray isolation and the pixels sur-
rounded by a ﬂoating n+ implanta-
tion. They will be referred as p-stop,
new p-spray and old p-spray designs.
The second is the nearest to ﬁnal
design for ATLAS.

The pulse height is obtained by the
Time Over Threshold technique [1].
Typical thresholds were around 3000
electrons with a dispersion of 170
electrons rms. The noise was typi-
cally 150 electrons rms.

Several single chip assemblies were
characterised extensively in test
beam experiments [5]. Only reso-
lution measurements are discussed
here. A telescope consisting of 4
planes of silicon microstrips was used
to reconstruct the tracks of the in-
cident beam particles. The setup
allowed the selection of the angle
α between the normal to the pixel
sensor plane and the beam direction.

are presented for a p-spray device (old
design) irradiated to 1015 neq/cm2.
Not irradiated sensors were operated
at 150 V bias voltage achieving full
depletion (280 µm). The irradiated
sensor was operated at 600 V corre-
sponding to a depletion depth of 190
µm [5]. The average charge collected
at the pixel centre for a perpendicular
track was thus reduced from 28000 to
15000 electrons.

2 Results

In what follows, x is the direction
along the short (50 µm) side of the
pixel, y the 400 µm direction. Beam
direction, the normal to the detector
and the x axis lie in the same plane.

The hit position can be reconstructed
using only the position of ﬁred pixels
(digital algorithm). For cluster sizes
greater than one it is possible to use
also the analog algorithm which takes
into account the correlation between
the track position and the variable
η = Ql/(Ql + Qf ) where Qf and Ql
are the charges collected by the ﬁrst
and last pixels in the cluster. The
charge collected by other (central)
pixels is not correlated to track posi-
tion and so it is not considered. More
details and a comparison with alter-
native algorithms can be found in [6].
The degradation of resolution due
to Landau ﬂuctuations is decreased
by setting to a maximum value Qcut
charges exceeding that limit.

spray device at 00. At this angle 98%
of the clusters have one or two pixels.
The few events with higher multiplic-
ity are due to delta-ray emission. At
any given angle, analogously, there
are always two dominant multiplici-
ties. Residuals are plotted separately
for each multiplicity.

Digital residual distributions are ﬁt-
ted with a square convoluted with a
gaussian. The gaussian width is taken
to be the telescope extrapolation er-
ror. Values of telescope resolution be-
tween 5.4 and 6.4 µm are found for
100. The square length is the
α
range of track positions correspond-
ing to that multiplicity. For old p-
spray devices at 00 this range is a
41 µm interval centred on the cen-
tre of the pixel for single pixel clus-
ters, a 9 µm interval centred on the

charge collection, while a resolution
of 9.8 µm at 150 is obtained for the
irradiated sensor.

After deconvolution of the telescope

In the y direction the residuals
present a ﬂat distribution between
-200 µm to +200 µm with a rms of
115 µm. A bricked structure (with
pixels in adjacent rows displaced by
200 µm) was also tested with the aim
of improving the y resolution by a
factor of two for clusters with charge
sharing in the x direction. Fig. 3

pixel clusters. The best digital resolu-
tion (Fig. 2) is obtained at angles for
which the two dominant multiplici-
ties are equally populated (50 for not
irradiated and 150 for irradiated de-
vices) while the worst resolution oc-
curs when one of them is much more
populated (as in Fig. 1).

At 50 for not irradiated and 150 for
irradiated devices single and double
pixel cluster occur with the same fre-
quency and resolution is good. At 100
for p-stop devices mainly double pixel
clusters occur and resolution is worse.

3 Conclusions

Resolution measurements have been
done on standard as well as irradi-
ated prototypes of ATLAS Pixel sen-
sors. In the short direction of the cell
analog resolutions in the range 6-14
µm have been measured before sub-
traction of telescope resolution, esti-
mated to be about 6 µm. A bricked
design has been shown to improve the
resolution in the long direction of the
cell.

Abstract

We show that doubly peaked electric ﬁelds are necessary to describe grazing-angle charge collection measurements
of irradiated silicon pixel sensors. A model of irradiated silicon based upon two defect levels with opposite charge
states and the trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to produce a good description of the measured charge
collection proﬁles in the ﬂuence range from 0.5×1014 neq/cm2 to 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. The model correctly predicts
the variation in the proﬁles as the temperature is changed from −10◦C to −25◦C. The measured charge collection
proﬁles are inconsistent with the linearly-varying electric ﬁelds predicted by the usual description based upon a
uniform eﬀective doping density. This observation calls into question the practice of using eﬀective doping densities
to characterize irradiated silicon.

1. Introduction

A silicon pixel detector [1] is currently being
developed for the CMS experiment at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The detector will be
a key component in the reconstruction of primary
and secondary vertices in the particularly harsh
LHC environment characterized by large track
multiplicities and high radiation backgrounds.
The innermost layer, located at only 4 cm from the

beam line, is expected to be exposed to a 1 MeV
neutron equivalent ﬂuence of 3 × 1014 neq/cm2 per
year at full luminosity.

The response of the silicon sensors during the
detector operation is of great concern. It is well
understood that the intra-diode electric ﬁelds in
these detectors vary linearly in depth reaching a
maximum value at the p-n junction. The linear be-
havior is a consequence of a constant space charge
density, Neﬀ , caused by thermally ionized impu-

rities in the bulk material. It is well known that
the detector characteristics are aﬀected by radia-
tion exposure, but it is generally assumed that the
same picture is valid after irradiation. In fact, it is
common to characterize the eﬀects of irradiation
in terms of a varying eﬀective charge density. In [2]
we have proved that this picture does not provide a
good description of irradiated silicon pixel sensors.
In addition, it was shown that it is possible to ade-
quately describe the charge collection characteris-
tics of a heavily irradiated silicon detector in terms
of a tuned double junction model which produces a
doubly peaked electric ﬁeld proﬁle across the sen-
sor. The modeling is supported by the evidence
of doubly peaked electric ﬁelds obtained directly
from beam test measurements and presented in [3].
The dependence of the modeled trap concentra-
tions upon ﬂuence was presented in [4]. In this pa-
per, we summarize the previous results and inves-
tigate the temperature dependence of the model.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the experimental setup, Section 3 describes
the carrier transport simulation used to interpret
the data. The tuning of the double junction model
and its resulting predictions are discussed in Sec-
tion 4. The temperature dependence of the data
and model are summarized in Section 5. The con-
clusions are given in Section 6.

2. Experimental setup

The measurements were performed in the H2
beam line of the CERN SPS in 2003/04 using 150-
225 GeV pions. The beam test apparatus is de-
scribed in [5]. A silicon beam telescope [6] consisted
of four modules each containing two 300 m m thick
single-sided silicon detectors with a strip pitch of
25 m m and readout pitch of 50 m m. The two de-
tectors in each module were oriented to measure
horizontal and vertical impact coordinates. A pixel
hybrid detector was mounted between the second
and third telescope modules on a cooled rotating
stage. A trigger signal was generated by a sili-
con PIN diode. The analog signals from all detec-
tors were digitized in a VME-based readout system
by two CAEN (V550) and one custom built ﬂash

ADCs. The entire assembly was located in an open-
geometry 3T Helmholtz magnet that produced a
magnetic ﬁeld either parallel or orthogonal to the
beam. The temperature of the tested sensors was
controlled with a Peltier cooler that was capable
of operating down to -30◦C. The telescope infor-
mation was used to reconstruct the trajectories of
individual beam particles and to achieve a precise
determination of the particle hit position in the
pixel detector. The resulting intrinsic resolution of
the beam telescope was about 1 m m.

The prototype pixel sensors are so-called “n-in-
n” devices: they are designed to collect charge from
n+ structures implanted into n–bulk silicon. All
test devices were 22×32 arrays of 125×125 µm2
pixels having a sensitive area of 2.75×4 mm2. The
substrate was 285 µm thick, n-doped, diﬀusively-
oxygenated ﬂoat zone silicon of orientation h111i,
resistivity of 3.7 kΩ·cm and oxygen concentration
in the order of 1017 cm−3. Individual sensors were
diced from fully processed wafers after the de-
position of under-bump metalization and indium
bumps. A number of sensors were irradiated at the
CERN PS with 24 GeV protons. The irradiation
was performed without cooling or bias. The deliv-
ered proton ﬂuences scaled to 1 MeV neutrons by
the hardness factor 0.62 [7] were 0.5×1014 neq/cm2,
2×1014 neq/cm2 and 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. All sam-
ples were annealed for three days at 30◦C. In order
to avoid reverse annealing, the sensors were stored
at -20◦C after irradiation and kept at room tem-
perature only for transport and bump bonding.
All sensors were bump bonded to PSI30/AC30
readout chips [8] which allow analog readout of
all 704 pixel cells without zero suppression. The
PSI30 settings were adjusted to provide a linear
response to input signals ranging from zero to
more than 30,000 electrons.

3. Sensor simulation

The interpretation of the test beam data relies
upon a detailed sensor simulation that includes the
modeling of irradiation eﬀects in silicon. The sim-
ulation, pixelav [2, 9, 10], incorporates the follow-
ing elements: an accurate model of charge deposi-

2

tion by primary hadronic tracks (in particular to
model delta rays); a realistic 3-D intra-pixel elec-
tric ﬁeld map; an established model of charge drift
physics including mobilities, Hall Eﬀect, and 3-D
diﬀusion; a simulation of charge trapping and the
signal induced from trapped charge; and a simula-
tion of electronic noise, response, and threshold ef-
fects. The intra-pixel electric ﬁeld map was gener-
ated using TCAD 9.0 [11] to simultaneously solve
Poisson’s Equation, the carrier continuity equa-
tions, and various charge transport models. A ﬁ-
nal simulation step reformatted the simulated data
into test beam format so that it could be processed
by the test beam analysis software.

The eﬀect of irradiation was implemented in the
TCAD simulation by including two defect levels in
the forbidden silicon bandgap with opposite charge
states and trapping of charge carriers. The model,
similar to one proposed in [12], is based on the
Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics and produces
an eﬀective space charge density ρeﬀ from the trap-
ping of free carriers in the leakage current. The ef-
fective charge density is related to the occupancies
and densities of traps as follows,

ρeﬀ = e [NDfD − NAfA] + ρdopants

(1)

where: ND and NA are the densities of donor and
acceptor trapping states, respectively; fD and fA
are the occupied fractions of the donor and accep-
tor states, respectively, and ρdopants is the charge
density due to ionized dopants. The donor and ac-
ceptor occupancies are related to the trap param-
eters by standard SRH expressions

donor trap; σA

capture cross sections for the acceptor trap; n and
p are the densities of free electrons and holes, re-
spectively; ni is the intrinsic density of carriers;
ED and EA are the activation energies (relative

to the mid-gap energy) of the donor and acceptor
states, respectively. Note that the single donor and
acceptor states model the eﬀects of many physical
donor and acceptor states. The two-trap model is
therefore an “eﬀective theory”.

The physics of the model is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The space charge density and electric ﬁeld proﬁle
are plotted as functions of depth z for a model
tuned to reproduce the Φ = 5.9 × 1014neqcm−2
charge collection data at 150V bias. The SRH pro-
cess produces electron-hole pairs more or less uni-
formly across the thickness of the sensor. As the
electrons drift to the n+ implant, the total elec-
tron current increases as z decreases. The hole cur-
rent similarly increases with increasing z. Trap-
ping of the mobile carriers produces a net posi-
tive space charge density near the p+ backplane
and a net negative space charge density near the
n+ implant. Since positive space charge density
corresponds to n-type doping and negative space
charge corresponds to p-type doping, there are p-n
junctions at both sides of the detector. The elec-
tric ﬁeld in the sensor follows from a simultaneous
solution of Poisson’s equation and the continuity
equations. The resulting z-component of the elec-
tric ﬁeld varies with an approximately quadratic
dependence upon z having a minimum at the zero
of the space charge density and maxima at both
implants. A more detailed description of the dou-
ble junction model and its implementation can be
found in [2].

Charge collection across the sensor bulk was
measured using the “grazing angle technique” [13].
As is shown in Fig. 2, the surface of the test sen-
sor is oriented by a small angle (15◦) with respect
to the pion beam. Several samples of data were
collected with zero magnetic ﬁeld and at temper-
ature of −10◦C and −25◦C. The charge measured
by each pixel along the y direction samples a dif-
ferent depth z in the sensor. Precise entry point
information from the beam telescope is used to
produce ﬁnely binned charge collection proﬁles.

The charge collection proﬁles for a sensor irradi-
ated to a ﬂuence of Φ = 5.9×1014 neq/cm2 and op-
erated at a temperature of −10◦C and bias voltages
of 150V and 300V are presented in Fig 3. The mea-
sured proﬁles are shown as solid dots and the simu-
lated proﬁles are shown as histograms. In order to
investigate the applicability of the traditional pic-
ture of type-inverted silicon after irradiation, the
simulated proﬁles were generated with electric ﬁeld
maps corresponding to two diﬀerent eﬀective den-
sities of acceptor impurities. The full histograms
are the simulated proﬁle for Neﬀ = 4.5×1012 cm−3.
Note that the 300V simulation reasonably agrees
with the measured proﬁle but the 150V simulation
is far too broad. The dashed histograms show the
result of increasing Neﬀ to 24 × 1012 cm−3. At this
eﬀective doping density, the width of the simulated
peak in the 150V distribution is close to correct
but it does not reproduce the “tail” observed in
the data at large y. The 300V simulated distribu-
tion is far too narrow and the predicted charge is
lower than the data (note that the proﬁles are ab-
solutely normalized). It is clear that a simulation

e , σA

The same measured proﬁles and those from bias
voltages of 200V and 450V are shown in Fig. 4.
They are compared with simulations based upon
the electric ﬁeld produced by the two trap model.
The model has six free parameters (ND, NA, σD
e ,
h , σA
σD
h ) that can be adjusted. The activa-
tion energies are kept ﬁxed to the values of [12].
Additionally, the electron and hole trapping rates,
Γe and Γh, are uncertain at the 30% level due to
the ﬂuence uncertainty and possible annealing of
the sensors. They are treated as constrained pa-
rameters. The donor concentration of the starting
material is set to 1.2 × 1012 cm−3 corresponding
to a full depletion voltage of about 70 V for an
unirradiated device. The parameters of the dou-
ble junction model were systematically varied and
the agreement between measured and simulated
charge collection proﬁles was judged subjectively.
Adequate agreement was achieved by setting the
ratio of the common hole and electron cross sec-
tions σh/σe to 0.25 and the ratio of the accep-
tor and donor densities NA/ND to 0.40. There is
a range of parameters in the ND-σe space that
produces reasonable agreement with the measured
proﬁles. The range is shown in Fig. 5a as the solid
line in the logarithmic space. If the donor density

becomes too small (ND < 20 × 1014 cm−3), the
150V simulation produces too much signal at large
z. If the donor density becomes too large (ND >
50 × 1014 cm−3), the 300V simulation produces in-
suﬃcient signal at large z. Since the simulated leak-
age current varies as Ileak ∝ σeND, diﬀerent points
on the allowed solid contour correspond to diﬀer-
ent leakage current. Contours of constant leakage
current are shown as dashed curves and are labeled
in terms of the corresponding damage parameter
α where α0 is the expected leakage current. It is
clear that the simulation can accommodate the ex-
pected leakage current which is smaller than the
measured current by a factor of three.

tion is shown as the solid histogram in each plot.

The simulation describes the measured charge
collection proﬁles well both in shape and normal-
ization. The “wiggle” observed at low bias voltages
is a signature of the doubly peaked electric ﬁeld
shown in Fig. 1. The relative signal minimum near
y = 700 µm (see Fig. 4) corresponds to the mini-
mum of the electric ﬁeld z-component, Ez, where
both electrons and holes travel only short distances

before trapping. This small separation induces only
a small signal on the n+ side of the detector. At
larger values of y, Ez increases causing the elec-
trons drift back into the minimum where they are
likely to be trapped. However, the holes drift into
the higher ﬁeld region near the p+ implant and
are more likely to be collected. The net induced
signal on the n+ side of the detector therefore in-
creases and creates the local maximum seen near
y = 900 µm.

The charge collection proﬁles at T = −10◦C
for sensors irradiated to ﬂuences of Φ = 0.5 ×
1014 neq/cm2 and Φ = 2 × 1014 neq/cm2 and op-
erated at several bias voltages are presented in
Fig. 6(a-c) and Fig. 6(d-g), respectively. The mea-
sured proﬁles, shown as solid dots, are compared to
the simulated proﬁles, shown as histograms. Note
that the “wiggle” is present at low bias even at
Φ = 0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2 which is just above the
“type-inversion” ﬂuence. This suggests that a dou-
bly peaked ﬁeld is present even at rather small ﬂu-
ences.

The double junction model can provide a reason-
able description of the lower ﬂuence measurements
using the parameters obtained with the ﬁtting pro-
cedure shown in Table 1. We observe that the donor
trap concentration increases more rapidly with ﬂu-
ence than does the acceptor trap concentration.
The ratio between acceptor and donor trap con-
centrations is 0.76 at the lowest ﬂuence and de-

the ﬁts exclude a linear dependence of the trap con-
centrations with the irradiation ﬂuence. At Φ =

is set to 0.25 for both donor and acceptor traps

e = 1 for the acceptor and donor traps, re-
spectively. The simulated leakage current is ap-
proximately linear in ﬂuence, but the ratio NA/ND
is clearly not constant. This may be a consequence
of the quadratic ﬂuence scaling of one or more di-
vacancy states or it may reﬂect the fact that the
two trap model with the particular choice of acti-
vation energies does not accurately model the de-
pendence of the trap occupancies on leakage cur-
rent. The allowed ND-σe parameter spaces for the
lower ﬂuence models are much more constrained
than in the Φ = 5.9×1014 neq/cm2 case and pre-
dict the expected leakage current.

Ez, is plotted as a function of z in Fig. 1 for Φ =

5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2, the ﬁeld proﬁle has a min-
imum near the midplane of the detector which
shifts toward the p+ implant at lower ﬂuences.
The ﬁeld has maxima at the detector implants
as discussed in Section 3. Figure 7(a) shows that

ﬂuence. The space charge density is not linear in
z due to the variation of the carrier drift velocities
with the electric ﬁelds.

5. Temperature dependence

The temperature dependence of the charge col-
lection proﬁles was studied by accumulating data
at T = −25◦C. The pixelav simulation includes
temperature dependent mobilities, diﬀusion, and
trapping rates. The TCAD calculation of the elec-
tric ﬁeld map is also based upon temperature de-
pendent quantities including the bandgap energy
and SRH lifetimes. The T = −25◦C charge collec-
tion proﬁles for the Φ = 2.0 × 1014 neq/cm2 and
Φ = 5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2 sensors are compared with
the simulation in Fig. 9. It is clear that the simu-
lation correctly tracks the temperature-dependent
variations in the measured proﬁles.

The eﬀect of temperature on the z-component
of the simulated electric ﬁeld at Φ = 5.9 ×
1014 neq/cm2 is shown in Fig. 10 for bias voltages
of 150V and 300V. It is clear that decreasing the
temperature also decreases the ﬁelds on the p+
side of the sensor and increases them on the n+
side.

6. Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that doubly peaked
electric ﬁelds are necessary to describe grazing-
angle charge collection measurements of irradiated
silicon pixel sensors. A model of irradiated silicon
based upon two defect levels with opposite charge
states and the trapping of charge carriers can be
tuned to produce a good description of the mea-
sured charge collection proﬁles in the ﬂuence range

from 0.5×1014 neq/cm2 to 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. The
model correctly predicts the variation in the pro-
ﬁles as the temperature is changed from −10◦C to

−25◦C.

The doubly peaked electric ﬁeld proﬁles have
maxima near the implants and minima near the
detector midplane. This corresponds to negative
space charge density near the n+ implant and and
positive space charge density near the p+ back-
plane. We ﬁnd that it is necessary to decrease the
ratio of acceptor concentration to donor concentra-
tion as the ﬂuence increases. This causes the elec-
tric ﬁeld proﬁle to become more symmetric as the
ﬂuence increases. The eﬀect of decreasing the tem-
perature has the opposite eﬀect of suppressing the
ﬁelds on the p+ side of the sensor and increasing
them on the n+ side.

The measured charge collection proﬁles of irra-
diated sensors are inconsistent with the linearly-
varying electric ﬁelds predicted by the usual de-
scription based upon a uniform eﬀective doping
density. This suggests that the correctness and the
physical signiﬁcance of eﬀective doping densities
determined from capacitance-voltage measure-
ments are quite unclear. In addition, we remark
that the notion of partly depleted silicon sensors
after irradiation is inconsistent with the measured
charge collection proﬁles and with the observed
doubly peaked electric ﬁelds.

The charge-sharing behavior and resolution
functions of many detectors are sensitive to the
details of the internal electric ﬁeld. A known
response function is a key element of any recon-
struction procedure. A working eﬀective model
will permit the detailed response of these detec-
tors to be tracked as they are irradiated in the
next generation of accelerators.

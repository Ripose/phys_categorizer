New frequency modulation readout based on relaxation oscillations

Abstract

Scaling of multi-pixel cryogenic detectors for imaging is rendered increasingly diﬃcult with size by the complexity
of readout circuitry and cryogenic constraints (thermal load from wiring).

We propose and demonstrate a new readout scheme based on a highly stable RF oscillator comprising a
superconducting tunnel junction which exhibits relaxation oscillations. The oscillation frequency is almost linear to
the analog bias signal over a wide operation range. The frequency signals from diﬀerent detectors can be combined
to one single readout line and easily detected outside the cryostat. The current noise of an optimized circuit
is about 5 pA/√Hz, comparable to standard SQUID ampliﬁers. We show experimental data from ‘stand-alone’
operation as well as response to microcalorimeter signals due to X-ray events.

Key words: relaxation oscillations, analog-to-frequency converter, superconducting tunnel junction, detector readout

Cryogenic radiation detectors [1] have proven to
be the devices of choice when it comes to high-
est energy sensitivity, single photon detection eﬃ-
ciency and direct spectroscopic resolution. For as-
trophysical observations a clear trend to large num-
ber pixel arrays for imaging is observed, accompa-
nied by big eﬀorts to solve the non-trivial problem
of cryogenic multiple channel readout. While most
readout schemes are based on some multiplexing
method using SQUID ampliﬁers, we propose and
demonstrate an alternative and relatively simple
low noise analog-to-frequency conversion circuit.

The operation principle is based on a hysteretic
superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) exhibiting
relaxation oscillations [2] in the RF range. If the

biasing of the device is potentially unstable [3]. An
oscillator circuit can be built with an STJ (normal

Hence, fr is proportional to Vs (or to Jb = Vs/Rs)
and the circuit behaves as an almost linear analog-
to-frequency converter over an acceptably broad
dynamic range.

Relaxation oscillations have been measured at
100 mK for various circuit parameters. An example
of an experimental fr(Vs) dependence for diﬀer-
ent critical currents Jc = J 0

the theoretical fr to the data points yielded (from bot-
tom to top): Jc = 58.07, 53.71, 48.15, 39.55, 29.98, 19.69,
and 10.63 µA (J 0

magnetic ﬁeld. This is particularly convenient for
tuning of the circuit behaviour or eventually ex-
tending the operation range to lower currents. The
slight deviation from linearity observed in Fig. 1 is
fully accounted for by using both Eqs. (1) and (2),
because τqp starts to contribute at higher Vs.

If we now introduce a cryogenic detector by re-
placing Rb with a high resistance (e.g. NIS mi-
crocalorimeter) or Rs with a low resistance de-
vice (e.g. TES), the detector signal will be directly
converted to a change in fr. The oscillator signal
Vout is easily detected (amplitude Vg) and demod-
ulated (e.g. phase-locked loop) with conventional
electronics outside the cryostat. The measured re-
sponse of the oscillator to a SINIS detector [5] sig-
nal due to an X-ray event is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Top: Relaxation oscillations during a SINIS de-
tector event (the detector replacing Rb). The amplitude
modulation and sinusoidal oscillation are due to the ap-
plied band-pass ﬁlter. Bottom: Time sequence of inverse
oscillation periods extracted from the above analog signal
(note the larger time scale, while the arrow indicates the
range of the top graph). Circuit and device parameters
were: L = 48 nH, Rs = 91 mΩ, Jc = 7.28 µA (κ = 8).

and f 1
r = 12.1 MHz, which can be related back
by Eq. (3) to obtain the currents 17.2 µA and
46.5 µA, respectively. Note the excellent agree-
ment between analog and frequency modulated
signal, which is particularly remarkable consid-
ering the model simpliﬁcations and experimental
uncertainties. The width of the oscillation period
distribution (in ‘stand-alone’ operation without
noisy detector) was typically on the order of 10−2.
For observation of stable relaxation oscillations
and optimum noise behaviour, several constraints
on circuit parameters have to be considered [4], a
discussion of which is beyond the scope of this pa-
per. Nevertheless, we present calculations and re-
alistic estimates for the proposed circuit including
standard (SI)NIS and TES detectors.

The main noise sources from the oscillator are
Johnson noise at Rs, shot noise from tunneling, 1/f
ﬂicker noise from two-level ﬂuctuators [6] and ther-
mally activated escape from the zero-voltage state
[7]. However, for typical STJ devices and high fre-
quency operation the latter process of thermal ex-
citation over an energy barrier was found to dom-
inate the circuit noise. Depending on junction pa-
rameters, temperature T and current increase rate

Jc/τsc the transitions out of the supercon-
ducting to the resistive state will occur at a current

probability function is in ﬁrst order proportional
to (T /Jc)2/3 [8]. Critical current ﬂuctuations are
directly reﬂected by ﬂuctuations of the relaxation
oscillation period δτr/τr = δJm/Jm, which allows
us to determine a current noise density (referred to
the circuit input and valid over a limited parame-
ter range [4]) of

Table 1 summarizes calculated optimum param-
eters for realistic (SI)NIS and TES readout. For
the current-to-voltage converter (NIS readout) we
have chosen the smallest STJ dimensions which
can still be easily fabricated by standard optical
lithography. In the case of TES readout we are re-
stricted to a typical resistance Rs of the detector.
The current noise levels jb in Table 1 are suﬃciently
low compared to detector or SQUID noise. Note

the main disadvantage of our TES readout scheme
which requires use of the less favoured current bi-
asing of the detector. Finally, we wish to comment
on the fact that this scheme is probably not ap-
propriate for readout of STJ detectors due to their
intrinsically low current levels compared to Jc of
the oscillator STJ.

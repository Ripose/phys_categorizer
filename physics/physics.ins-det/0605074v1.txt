Abstract

The front-end electronics of the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter (Tile Cal) is housed
in a unit, called PMT-Block. The PMT-Block is a compact instrument comprising
a light mixer, a PMT together with its divider and a 3-in-1 card, which provides
shaping, ampliﬁcation and integration for the signals. This instrument needs to
be qualiﬁed before being assembled on the detector. A PMT-Block test bench has

been developed for this purpose. This test bench is a system which allows fast, albeit
accurate enough, measurements of the main properties of a complete PMT-Block.
The system, both hardware and software, and the protocol used for the PMT-Blocks
characterisation are described in detail in this report. The results obtained in the
test of about 10000 PMT-Blocks needed for the instrumentation of the ATLAS
(LHC-CERN) hadronic Tile Calorimeter are also reported.

1 Introduction

A PMT-Block [1] [2] is the device used by the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter to
convert light into electric signals. It is composed of a photomultiplier tube 1 , a
light mixer, a high voltage divider and a 3-in-1 card [3]. The light mixer pro-
vides the interface between the PMT and the ﬁber bundle which collects some
of the light produced in the scintillator of the sampling calorimeter. The 3-in-1
card forms the front-end of the electronic read-out chain. It provides three ba-
sic functions: fast pulse shaping and ampliﬁcation to accommodate the large
dynamic range needed by the detector, charge injection calibration and slow
integration of the PMT signals for monitoring and calibrations. This paper
will not enter into a detailed description of each element. A documentation of
their characteristics has been already published for most of them.

A PMT is assembled inside a soft iron and a mu-metal cylinder, which pro-
vides adequate magnetic shielding. The individual components and the fully
assembled PMT-Block are shown in ﬁgure 1.

Figure 1. The PMT-Block. a) on the left the individual pieces are shown and b) on
the right the PMT-Block is fully assembled.

The PMT-Blocks are housed inside drawers. A drawer provides the mechanical
support both for the PMT-Block and the electronic boards (also called mother
boards). A drawer contains up to 24 PMT-Blocks. The mother boards are
connected to each PMT-Block, supplying the PMT dividers with the high
voltage, the 3-in-1 cards with the low voltages and conveying control and
calibration signals to the 3-in-1 cards. The mother board also houses the
electronics to process the signals coming from the shaper and the integrator.

All the components assembled in a PMT-Block underwent an individual Qual-
ity Control process. However, it is necessary to check the PMT-Block as a
whole before inserting it in a drawer. This test bench is intended to check
each speciﬁc functionality of a PMT-Block while no attempt is made to char-
acterise the individual components, as speciﬁc test benches are dedicated to
this task. The result of the test here described is either a certiﬁcation of full
functionality, or the identiﬁcation of the parts of the PMT-Block which are

not working properly, together with a brief description of the problem.

The PMT-Block test bench has been developed to be:

– Aﬀordable. Commercial electronics can be very expensive and should be
avoided whenever it is possible. On the other side spare electronics is avail-
able in the laboratories and can be employed for the tests.

– Easy to use. The system should be operated also by a non-expert crew,

hence it must be very intuitive and easy to use.

– Stable. A few years of work were needed to characterize all the PMT-Blocks.
During this time, the system had to operate in a stable way, with no major
breakdowns. Moreover, the test bench will be kept working during all of
the experiment’s lifetime for test purposes. This implies that the test bench
must operate in stable conditions for about 15 years.

– Portable. Since the test bench has to operate for many years, we expect
that the platform used for the DAQ system will change. It is desirable that
the high level functionality of the test bench will not change, leaving the
low level to cope with a changing platform. It has been decided to write the
DAQ in ANSI C code to minimise the eﬀorts to move the system to another
platform and to reduce the costs that another institution would bear if a
commercial DAQ system was used.

– Versatile. The DAQ system has to be easily modiﬁable and versatile enough
to accomplish any change in the protocol and also in the hardware itself.
This characteristic turned out to be very useful, since the same DAQ has
been used also in other test benches for PMT characterization.

Keeping this in mind, the design of the test bench was split into three parts:

– The hardware used in this test bench
– The protocol used for the characterization of the PMT-Block test
– The DAQ software which is rather independent of this speciﬁc test bench

In this paper each one item of the above items is described in detail and the
tests performed are reported.

2 The experimental set-up

A schematic diagram of the test bench is shown in Figure 2. Up to eight
PMT-Blocks can be housed in special cradles inside a light-tight box (Figures
3 and 4). The Blocks are connected to the High Voltage distribution, to the
signal and to the control cables, which are routed through the motherboard
as they are in the detector. In absence of a drawer the connection between the
PMT-Blocks and the motherboard is provided by special home-made boards
(Figure 4).

The controls and readout proceed through the motherboard with a protocol
which is the same as the one used in the detector.

The PMTs are illuminated by two LEDs 2 , one operating in continuous and
the second in pulsed mode. The LEDs are housed in a black plastic cylinder
and face a liquid ﬁber which is connected, inside the black box, to a ﬁber
bundle, in order to distribute the light to each PMT (Figure 5). The light
source is very simple and was designed and built in our labs. The amount of
light each PMT receives has been roughly equalised among the eight PMTs
using neutral optical ﬁlters.

The DAQ of the test bench comprises the control and readout electronics

located in the VME crate has been programmed to control the sequence of
operations. Control and pulse signals are produced by an I/O register 4 . The

Figure 5. The picture on the top shows a detail of the light source system. Two
LEDs, one operated in DC and the other in pulsed mode are assembled inside a
black cylinder and coupled to a liquid ﬁber to take the light into the black box.
The picture on the bottom shows a detail of the coupling of the liquid ﬁber to the
ﬁber bundle. The ﬁber bundle is made of 32 clear ﬁbers which are distributed four
in each PMT.

I/O bits of the register control the status of the HV power supply 5 . The signal
to pulse the LED and to STOP the ADCs is generated acting on the I/O bits
as well.

A VME Fermi ADC 6 measures the light in the pulsed mode (i.e. the signal
OUT from the 3-in-1 card of each PMT). A second ADC 7 is used to measure
the PMT current when operating in continuous light mode (integrator OUT
from the 3-in-1 card). Though the two ADC models are not optimal for this
task, they were available and could be easily included in the test bench. They
accomplished their assigned task in a satisfactory way.

A receiver card (blue box in Figure 2) converts the fast diﬀerential signals from
the 3-in-1 cards to single ended ones, and interfaces the 3-in-1 to the Fermi
ADC.

A second detector-speciﬁc unit (3-in-1 controller in Figure 2) is used to set the
mode of operation of the 3-in-1 cards and also to provide the charge injection
for the tests of the 3-in-1 electronics.

As far as the LED drivers for pulse and continuous light are concerned, we
have preferred two home-made circuits to commercial units. A VME DAC unit
sets the continuous light of the LED to the desired intensity. A NIM circuit
generates fast (20-30 ns) pulses, whose amplitude can be modulated by a DAC
(0,+60 Volts) and is triggered by one bit of the I/O register.

The DAQ system was required to be simple and inexpensive, hence it had to
be designed with a few detector speciﬁc, home-made units. The whole system
is shown in Figure 6.

3 Protocol

The sequence of operations needed for testing the PMT-Blocks is described
in this section. As already mentioned, the PMT-Block is an assembly of three
main parts: a light mixer, a PMT with its divider and the F/E electronics (the
3-in-1 card).

The 3-in-1 cards form the front end of the electronics chain. They provide 3
basic functions: a fast pulse shaping of the PMT output with two gains to
provide the dynamic range, a slow integrator circuit for measuring DC cur-
rent for detector monitoring [1], and a charge injection system for electronics
calibration. These three functions are controlled by an on-board logic driven
by a remote controller.

The test starts checking the functionality of the 3-in-1 card, independently of
the PMT, by injecting a precise quantity of charge into the 3-in-1 input and
recording the ampliﬁed and shaped output pulses. Then, short light pulses are
sent to the PMT to check its performances. Finally, continuous light of diﬀer-
ent intensities is used to test the Integrator in diﬀerent operating conditions.

3.1 The Test of the Charge Injection System

During the Charge Injection System test the high voltage and light system are
OFF and the 3-in-1 card is set in the charge injection conﬁguration. Diﬀerent
charges are then injected, covering the dynamic range of the device, both in the
low and the high gain. Output signal from the low gain, high gain and trigger
channels are recorded. At the end of this test, a linear ﬁt of the measured
output signal as function of the injected charge, is performed. The low and
high gain of each channel are the slope of the ﬁt line and are stored on disk
for further analysis.

3.2 The test with light pulse

During this part of the test the high voltage is ON and the light system
operates in pulsed mode. The aim is to simulate the working conditions of the
PMT in the experiment by ﬂashing the PMT with light of diﬀerent intensities.
In tests performed previously, all the PMTs have been characterized and their
nominal voltage has been deﬁned (nominal HV is that for which the gain of a
given PMT is 105). However, for this test a common value of the HV (800 V)
was preferred for simplicity. Three diﬀerent light levels were used to simulate:
a) the signals produced in the calorimeter by a minimum ionizing particle,

9

b) a signal falling in the energy region where the two gains overlap, and c)
a jet with energy of about one TeV. For each PMT-Block, 5000 events are
then recorded at each light setting. The pulse shape is recorded by the V571
ﬂash ADC. The program performs the pulse measurement and the pedestal
subtraction on-line. Two histograms for each PMT are ﬁlled: the ﬁrst one for
the low gain, the second one for the high gain. The average value of each
histogram and its r.m.s. are stored to disk.

3.3 The Test of the slow integrator

During the Slow Integrator test the high voltage is ON, the light system is
operated in DC mode and the 3-in-1 card is set to integrator mode. This
operation will be used to monitor the calorimeter gain using minimum bias
events when LHC is running and the light produced by a 137Cs source that, in
special runs, will move through all of the calorimeter cells [6]. Three diﬀerent
levels of DC light are used to simulate the pile-up events, the Cs source and a
level of light in between. The average output current for each level (pedestal
subtracted) is measured and stored on disk.

3.4 Data analysis and decision

The data analysis is performed on-line, right after the data taking and, at the
end of the test, the relevant information to the PMT-Block is available in an
ASCII ﬁle. Since the aim of this test is to check the functionality of the PMT-
Blocks without performing their full characterization, the measured values are
checked to be within an acceptance range. If this is the case, the PMT-Block
is accepted; otherwise it is rejected and sent back for repair. A screen message
indicates to the operator which PMT-Blocks are to be rejected. The acceptance
ranges used are summarized in Table 1. At the end of each measurement the

3.5 Sequence of operations

The sequence of operations required to perform the tests of a PMT-Block
batch described above, is the following:

(1) an ensemble of eight PMT-Blocks are mounted into the black box (man-

(2) the cables of the PMT-Blocks are connected to the patch panel (manual);
(3) the identiﬁcation information of the PMT-Block are collected and the

database initialised (manual);

(4) the CIS test is then performed and the results are stored to disk (auto-

(5) the fast pulse test is performed and the results stored to disk (automatic);
(6) the slow integrator test is performed and the results stored to disk (au-

ual);

matic);

tomatic);

(7) the results are analysed and the decision is made to accept or reject the

PMT-Block (automatic);

(8) ﬁnally the PMT-Blocks are removed from the test bench. The PMT-

Blocks to be rejected are put aside (manual).

A complete test of a batch of 8 PMT-Blocks takes about 25 minutes from the
PMT insertion to their removal.

4 Software

The guidelines followed in the development of this test bench have been stated
in the introduction. The software has to fulﬁll all these requirements, i.e. it
has to be aﬀordable, easy to use, stable, portable and versatile.

The software was developed by following a layered approach. The operations
to be performed on the VME data bus are two: write to and read from the
bus. Every board is interfaced by a small library which supplies the basic set
of routines to operate the board itself.

The layered structure of our software is the following:

– kernel – This is the part of the code that interfaces to the menu, data and
ﬁle handling and deals with error management. It takes care of the VME bus
initialization and read/write functions. This is the only platform dependent
part of the code and must be written accordingly to the hardware used to
interface the VME bus;

– libraries – Each VME board has its own library of functions that are re-
sponsible for initialization, control and data acquisition. If a new board is
added, a new library has to be written. The debugging is easy as only the
basic functions have to be checked, while more complex functions can be
obtained by suitable scripts. At this level, the software is platform indepen-
dent and can be moved from one system to another without changing the
code if the system supplies an ANSI-C compliant compiler;

– scripts – This is the part dealing with the implementation of a speciﬁc test.
The user takes advantage of the hardware functions without worrying how
operations are performed and has only to concentrate on the measurements.
This part is, of course, platform independent.

The software has been originally developed on a Cetia PowerPC board (CVME
604) with LynxOS 2.4 operating system.

Every hardware board is activated by a set of commands available from a sub-
menu in the DAQ program. These routines are used for simple operations like
setting the number of boards present in the crate, setting the VME address
to access them and the basic read/write functions.

The DAQ system is essentially a command line driven program, with simple
operations available from menus and sub-menus that perform speciﬁc actions.
Multiple commands can be written on the same line and the program takes
care of splitting them into single tokens. These commands can be grouped in
macros that the program is able to execute. Macros can be called and nested
and complicated sequences of commands are easily obtained, thus providing
a very high level of ﬂexibility. Any kind of test bench can be implemented

12

without too much trouble, provided the right macros are written.

To handle the data coming from the VME boards, we have included in the
system a histogram handling package `a la HBOOK [7] and a data handling
package `a la SIGMA [8], to perform simple mathematical operations as well
as ﬁle handling. A preliminary analysis can be performed on-line but data can
be written on disk for an accurate, oﬀ-line, analysis.

During the years this software has been tested on several systems, from Mo-
torola 68x to PowerPC and Intel based platforms. Besides the usage in the
ATLAS experiment, the same software has been used in several occasions;
from data acquisition in the test beam setup for the AMS electromagnetic
calorimeter [9] to the trigger interface in the framework of the MAGIC tele-
scope [10].

An example of the scripts used in the test is shown in the Appendix.

5 Results from the PMT Block test

In the following some results from the test of about 10000 PMT-Blocks are
presented.

5.1 Charge Injection System Test

In the charge injection test, the important parameter is the ratio (R) of the
gains measured in the high gain mode and low gain mode of the 3-in-1 card.
The distribution of R is shown in Figure 7. The mean value is 65.19, very
close to the nominal value of 64. It should be noted that the resolution of
this measurement does not reﬂect the quality of the hardware [3],[4], it rather
represents the accuracy of this test procedure.

Figure 7. Distribution of the CIS slope. The acceptance window is the interval
44 − 84.

5.2 Light Pulse test

The output of the Pulse Test provides the mean value and the r.m.s. for the
high and low gain mode of the 3-in-1 card. For a PMT-Block to pass this part
of the test, the value of the ratio: r.m.s./mean has to be less than 25%. In
Figures 8 a) and b) the distributions of this quantity for low and high gain
respectively are shown. The eﬀective resolution shown in the plots is due in
part to the photo-statistics and in part to the diﬀerent share of light in the

14

diﬀerent channels. It is clear that in both cases this condition is fulﬁlled for
the vast majority of the PMT-Blocks.

Figure 8. Top: Distribution of rms/mean · 100 for low gain working conditions.
Bottom: Distribution of the rms/mean · 100 for high gain working conditions.

5.3 Integrator test

In this third test, three diﬀerent DC light levels are used. For each level,
the current is measured and its mean value is recorded together with the
corresponding r.m.s.. The aim of the procedure is to observe an increase of
the mean value as a consequence of the increase of the light level. The mean
values of the three levels are denoted as INT1, INT2 and INT3 from the lower
to the higher, respectively. The distribution of the mean values of the three
quantities is shown in Figure 9. The acceptance ranges of the three mean values
were given in Table 1. The distributions of ﬁgure 9 are quite wide because no
attempt was done to equalize the gain of the PMTs. It was veriﬁed that the
system is behaving correctly by plotting the ratios of the integral event by
event, as is shown in Figure 10.

5.4 Fraction of rejected PMT-Blocks

The fraction of the PMT-Blocks rejected by each of the three tests in the ﬁrst
pass is shown in Table 2; the same table also summarizes the percentage of
rejected PMT Blocks.

6 Conclusions

A test bench for the PMT-Blocks employed in the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter
has been developed. The aim of these tests was to ensure the functionality
of the PMT-Blocks before their ﬁnal insertion in the super-drawers. The test
allows fast and accurate enough measurements of the main properties of a
complete PMT-Block (light mixer / PMT and divider / 3-in-1 card). The
ability of performing diﬀerent tests, each of them checking a special operation
mode of the PMT-Block, is another important characteristic of the system.
This test bench has been used for the quality control of 10300 PMT-Blocks
that will be used in the ATLAS experiment. The diﬀerent operational modes
of the Blocks were checked by three diﬀerent tests, in order to ensure their
full functionality. The DAQ system consists of basic routines, each one corre-
sponding to a diﬀerent electronic instrument housed in the VME crate, and
it is based on a structure which permits high level calls from a non-compiled
code. The fraction of the rejected PMT-Blocks in the ﬁrst pass was about
2.5%.

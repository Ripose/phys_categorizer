In 2002 the ﬁrst combined beam test of the hadronic and electromagnetic liquid-
argon endcap calorimeters of the ATLAS experiment took place at the SPS test
beam at CERN. A total of 15 million events from electrons, muons and pions in
the energy range from 6 to 200 GeV were recorded. The entire calibration chain,
from digital ﬁlter weights, over calibration constants, to clustering and energy
weights, as is relevant for the energy calibration of hadronic and electromagnetic
showers in ATLAS was tested and applied to the beam test data. The calibration
methods and ﬁrst results for the combined performance of the two calorimeters are
presented.

1. Introduction

Calorimeters

1.1. The ATLAS Hadronic and Electromagnetic Endcap

The ATLAS hadronic (HEC) and electromagnetic (EMEC) liquid-argon
endcap calorimeters 1−3 have to provide accurate measurements of jet en-
ergies and directions, missing transverse energy and particle identiﬁcation
in the pseudo-rapidity range 1.5 ≤ |η| ≤ 3.2. Methods relevant for the
energy calibration in ATLAS and ﬁrst results of the combined performance
are subject of this presentation.

1.2. The 2002 Beam Test Setup

1/8 wheel of the EMEC was placed in front of 3 out of 32 HEC1 modules and
2 out of 32 HEC2 half-modules in a cryostat in the H6 test beam area at the

CERN SPS. The restriction to 2 half modules of the second HEC wheel was
mainly due to space constraints given by the cryostat. The 2 HEC2 half-
modules were furthermore rotated by half a φ-segment around the beam
axis w.r.t the nominal position in ATLAS in order to minimize the leakage
of hadronic energy. In front of the ﬁrst EMEC layer a presampler endcap
module placed inside the cryostat allowed studies of preshower corrections
with optional additional material in front of the cryostat.

The beam particles hit the calorimeters at an angle of 90◦ in the region
corresponding to |η| ≃ 1.5−2.0. Since both calorimeters have readout struc-
tures pointing in η the observed response to electrons, pions, and muons
was spread over more cells in η than expected in ATLAS.

Scintillators for triggering and timing and 4 MWPCs with horizontal
and vertical wire planes for beam position reconstruction were present fur-
ther upstream in the beam line.

2. Signal Reconstruction

The signal reconstruction follows closely the methods deployed in previous
stand-alone beam tests of the EMEC 4 and the HEC 5.

The output from the EMEC and from the HEC summing ampliﬁers were
processed outside the cryostat in front-end-boards (FEB), which perform
the ampliﬁcation of the EMEC signals and the signal shaping for both
calorimeters. A switched capacity array holds the digitized samples at a
sampling rate of 40 MHz.

For each event 7 (16) samples per EMEC (HEC) channel were recorded
together with the MWPC response, trigger information and the TDC mea-
sured delay between the trigger and the 40 MHz sampling clock.

2.1. Optimal Filtering

The raw ADC samples are processed with an optimal ﬁltering (OF)
method 6 using 5 samples.

For the HEC the detailed knowledge of each component in the electron-
ics chain and the form of the input calibration pulse is used to determine
the response function, which in turn is used to predict the shape for physics
signals.

For the EMEC with its more complicated electronic chain a numerical
method 7 can be used to ﬁnd the signal shape from the measured cali-
bration response and the Fourier transformations of the ionization and the
calibration current.

The resulting predicted physics shapes together with the autocorrelation
matrices from noise runs are used for the computation of the OF weights.
Unlike the ﬁnal situation in ATLAS with its ﬁxed delay between trigger
and sampling clock the beam test trigger comes asynchronous w.r.t. the
sampling clock. Therefore the OF weights are calculated in steps of 0.5 ns
in order to ﬁll the 25 ns trigger window and parameterized by a 4th order
polynomial.

The achieved accuracy for the amplitude reconstruction following this
method is better than 1.5 % (2 %) for the HEC (EMEC). The OF reduces
the noise of the amplitude to 64 % (72 %) of its non-ﬁltered value in the
HEC (EMEC).

DAC level scans are used to ﬁnd the conversion factors from ADC counts

to nA. The linearity is found to be better than 0.5 %.

3. Energy Reconstruction

3.1. Signal Corrections

The non-uniformity of the E-ﬁeld and sampling-fraction variations along the
azimuth (φ) in the EMEC are accounted for by applying a correction (up
to 2 %) derived from the signal variation found for electrons as a function
of the reconstructed position in units of the cell width in the second EMEC
layer. Another correction (up to 1 %) is applied to account for residual
signal variations with the delay time between trigger and sampling clock.
A potentially relevant variation with η is ignored due to the narrow η-range
considered in the beam test.

For the HEC a high voltage failure in 1 out of 16 LAr-gaps in the second
sampling for the middle module in φ makes a correction of up to 15 % in
this φ-region in the 2nd layer necessary.

Following these corrections good uniformity for both calorimeters is ob-

served.

3.2. Clustering

In each sampling a two-dimensional topological cluster algorithm is used
to deﬁne the group of readout cells relevant for analysis. Each cluster
consists of at least one cell with a signal-to-noise ratio above 4 (E > 4σ).
A threshold on the absolute value of the signal-to-noise ratio, |E| > 2σ,
is applied to all other cells. They are included in the cluster if they share
at least one edge with a cluster member cell satisfying |E| > 3σ. The

symmetric cuts on the cell and neighbor level avoid biases due to electronics
noise. Two super-clusters for the EMEC and the HEC are deﬁned by
summing all cluster signals in the EMEC and the HEC, respectively. For
the HEC the signals in the 3rd layer are multiplied by 2 in order to account
for the 50 % smaller sampling fraction.

3.3. Response to Electrons

From Monte Carlo simulations of the test beam conﬁguration the leakage
outside the EMEC was found to be very small for electrons and is neglected.
Therefore the ratio of the known beam energy (6 − 150 GeV) and the sum
of all signals in the EMEC in nA deﬁnes the electromagnetic scale factor,
αEMEC
= 0.3855 ± 0.004 MeV/nA, where the error is statistical only. The
em
variation with energy tests the linearity in the energy range considered and
was found to be better than 0.5 %.

The energy resolution for electrons is studied with the super-cluster
in the EMEC which contains 96 − 98 % of the signal for high energies.
Below 30 GeV the containment falls from 96 % to 90 % for the lowest beam
energies.

In data the resolution is found to be σE/E = (0.111±0.002)/pE/GeV⊕
0±0.001 after noise subtraction. The noise σnoise ≃ 0.2−0.3 GeV varies with
energy due to the non-ﬁxed cluster size. Geant3 8, 9 (Geant4 10, 11) based
Monte Carlo simulations yield slightly better (worse) resolution results.

3.4. Response to Pions

The electromagnetic scale for the HEC is taken from the previous stand-
alone beam test 5, αHEC
em = 3.27 ± 0.03 MeV/nA, taking the modiﬁed
electronics into account. Good agreement of the total visible energy in
the EMEC and HEC for pions with Monte Carlo simulations based ei-
ther on Geant3 or the quark-string-gluon-plasma (QGSP) model of Geant4
is observed while the Geant4 low-and-high-energy-pion-parameterization
(LHEP) model deviates largely from data.

3.5. Weighting

The non-compensating nature of the two calorimeters makes weighting of
hadronic energy deposits necessary. A cell based weighting method which
was successfully used in previous experiments 12, 13 needs a detailed simu-
lation on the cell level, which is not yet available for ATLAS. Therefore a
more coarse weighting scheme on the super-cluster level has been applied.

With the leakage outside the detector volume as predicted by the
Monte Carlo and the known beam energy 6 weights (3 for the EMEC
and 3 for the HEC) are ﬁtted from the two super-cluster energies
and their energy density,
leading to the weighted energies Ew =
Eem (C1 · exp [−C2 · Eem/V ] + C3).

The noise subtracted resolution for negative pions σE/E = (0.827 ±
0.003)/pE/GeV ⊕ 0 ± 0.003 is slightly worse than expected from Monte
Carlo, which gives sampling terms around 70 %. For positive pions a sam-
pling term of (79.9 ± 0.4)% is found in data.

The ratio of the combined weighted energy of EMEC and HEC over
the combined electromagnetic energy yields the eﬀective e/π-ratio for the
endcap calorimeters ranging from 1.32 at 20 GeV to 1.19 at 200 GeV for
negative pions and 0.05 larger values for positive pions. Geant4 based
simulations predict smaller ratios by 0.02 for LHEP and 0.05 for QGSP,
while Geant3 is oﬀ by −0.09.

Abstract

Silicon carbide represents a class of semiconductors, due to its polytypism. Besides
its properties of interest for semiconductor devices, sometimes better than silicon
and diamond, it is supposed to have a good radiation tolerance. In the present work,
the bulk degradation of SiC in hadron ﬁelds (pions and protons), in the energy range
between 100 MeV and 10 GeV has been estimated theoretically: the nuclear stopping
power and the concentration of primary defects. The results are compared to the
similar ones corresponding to diamond and silicon.

1 Introduction. General properties

Silicon carbide is a new interesting material for use in the fabrication of opto-
electronic and electronic devices, detectors, for the nuclear waste technology
or for use in fusion reactors. In all these applications, this semiconductor mate-
rial could be exposed to extreme condition of temperature, to chemical agents
and to irradiation ﬁelds.

SiC is not a simple semiconductor, it is a whole class of semiconductors because
of its polytypism [1]. The polytypism refers to one-dimensional polymorphism,
i.e. the existence of diﬀerent stackings of the basic structural elements along
one direction. More than 200 polytypes have been reported [2]. Only few of
them have practical importance. These include the cubic form 3C (β), and the
4H and 6H hexagonal forms. For the cubic polytype, the symmetry group is
T 2

d , while for the hexagonal ones this is C 4

6v.

In Figure 1, the 3C (β), 4H and 6H polytypes are displayed. Their periodicity
is over 3, 4 and 6 bilayers of Si and C, respectively. The layer sequences are
ABC..., ABCB..., ABCACB..., respectively. It is important to note that not
all atomic bilayers of Si and C in a given structure, and thus not all Si or C
atoms, are equivalent. In Figure 1, the nonequivalent layers are denoted by the
letters h and k, for 6H SiC even with additional indices. The inequivalence is
related to the relative positioning of the layers. All atoms are located in the
h11 2 0i plane.
Some material characteristics of diﬀerent polytypes of SiC are presented in
comparison with the corresponding ones of diamond, silicon and GaAs in
Tables 1 and 2.

Electronic devices made of SiC can operate at extremely high temperatures
without suﬀering from intrinsic conduction eﬀects due to its wide bandgap.
Also, this characteristic allows to emit short wavelength light when fabricated
into a light emitting diode structure. The high breakdown electric ﬁeld, ap-
proximately one order of magnitude higher than the silicon or GaAs one, and
the high thermal conductivity, enable the fabrication of very high-voltage,
high-power devices that dissipate large amounts of the excess heat generated.
Additionally, it allows the devices to be placed very close together, providing
high device packing density for integrated circuits. SiC devices can also op-
erate at high frequencies (microwave) because of the high saturation electron
drift velocity in the material.

Some SiC material characteristics are useful for detection applications: its
radiation length lies between the corresponding values of diamond and silicon;
its relatively wide band gap and a relative dielectric constant of 7.04 allows
the assembly of detectors with low noise. With low mobilities 450 [cm2V−1s−1]
for electrons and 115 [cm2V−1s−1] for holes respectively, SiC does not permit
a fast signal development and is not able to operate in high ﬂuxes of particles.

The crystalline materials for semiconductor devices used in high ﬂuences of
particles are strongly aﬀected by the eﬀects of radiation. After the interaction
between the incoming particle and the target, mainly two classes of degra-
dation eﬀects are observed: surface and bulk material damage, due to the
displacement of atoms from their sites in the lattice. After leptons (photons,

2

electrons, muons) irradiation, the eﬀects are dominantly at the surface, while
heavy particles (hadrons and ions) produce both types of damages.

Up to now, in spite of the experimental and theoretical eﬀorts, the problems
related to the behaviour of semiconductor materials in radiation ﬁelds, the
identiﬁcation of the induced defects and their characterisation, as well as the
explanation of the degradation mechanisms are still open problems.

The diamond has the reputation of being a radiation hard material and is con-
sidered as a good competitor to silicon. It is supposed that the SiC behaviour
in the radiation ﬁeld to be between diamond and silicon.

The treatment of the interaction between the incident particle and the solid
material can be performed from the point of view of the projectile or of the tar-
get. In the ﬁrst case, the relevant quantities are the energy loss (or equivalently
stopping power) and in the second situation the eﬀects of the interactions are
described by physical quantities characterising material degradation.

2 Mechanisms of degradation

At the passage of the incident charged particle in the semiconductor material
same of its energy is deposited into the target. The charged particles interact
with both atomic and electronic systems in a solid. The total rate of energy
loss, could, in general, be divided artiﬁcially into two components, the nuclear
and the electronic part.

The energy lost due to interactions with the electrons of the target gives rise
to material ionisation, while the energy lost in interactions with nuclei is at
the origin of defect creation.

A comprehensive theoretical treatment of electronic stopping, which covers all
energies of interest cannot be formulated simply because of diﬀerent approxi-
mations concerning both the scattering and contribution of diﬀerent electrons
in the solid. For fast particles with velocities higher then the orbital velocities
of electrons, the Bethe-Bloch formula has been used [3]. At lower velocities,
inner electrons have velocities greater than particle velocity, and therefore do
not contribute to the energy loss. This regime has been modelled for the gen-
eral case by Lindhard and Scharﬀ [4] and the particular case of 6H-SiC has
been treated, e.g. in reference [5]. If the particle has a positive charge, and a
velocity close to the orbital velocity of its outer electrons, it has a high prob-
ability of capturing an electron from one of the atoms of the medium through
which it passes. This process contributes to the total inelastic energy loss since
the moving ion has to expend energy in the removal of the electrons which it

3

captures.

The nuclear stopping depends on the detailed nature of the atomic scattering,
and this in turn depends intimately on the form of the interaction potential. At
low energies, a realistic potential based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation
has been used in the literature [4] and at higher energies, where scattering
results from the interaction of unscreened nuclei, a Rutherford collision model
is to be used.

There is not one physical quantity dedicated to the global characterisation
of the eﬀects of radiation in the semiconductor material. A possible one is
the concentration of primary radiation induced defects on the unit particle
ﬂuence (CPD) [6]. Due to the fact that it does not exist a theory describing
these interaction processes, phenomenological models are used.

In this paper, the mechanism considered in the study of the interaction be-
tween the incoming particle and the solid, by which bulk defects are produced,
is the following: the particle, heavier than the electron, with electrical charge
or not, interacts with the electrons and with the nuclei of the crystalline lat-
tice. The nuclear interaction produces bulk defects. As a result of the inter-
action, depending on the energy and on the nature of the incident particle,
one or more light particles are produced, and usually one or more heavy recoil
nuclei. These nuclei have charge and mass numbers lower or at least equal
with those of the medium. After the interaction process, the recoil nucleus
or nuclei, if they have suﬃcient energy, are displaced from the lattice posi-
tions into interstitials. Then, the primary knock-on nucleus, if its energy is
large enough, can produce the displacement of a new nucleus, and the process
could continue as a cascade, until the energy of the nucleus becomes lower
than the threshold for atomic displacements. Because of the regular nature of
the crystalline lattice, the displacement energy is anisotropic. In the concrete
evaluation of defect production, the nuclear interactions must be modelled,
see for example [6–8]. The primary interaction between the hadron and the
nucleus of the lattice presents characteristics reﬂecting the peculiarities of the
hadron, especially at relatively low energies. If the inelastic process is initiated
by nucleons, the identity of the incoming projectile is lost, and the creation of
secondary particles is associated with energy exchanges which are of the order
of MeV or larger. For pion nucleus processes, the absorption, the process by
which the pion disappears as a real particle, is also possible.

The energy dependence of cross sections, for proton and pion interaction with
the nucleus, present very diﬀerent behaviours: the proton-nucleus cross sec-
tions decrease with the increase of the projectile energy, then have a minimum
at relatively low energies, followed by a smooth increase, while the pion nu-
cleus cross sections present for all processes a large maximum, at about 160
MeV, reﬂecting the resonant structure of interaction (the ∆33 resonance pro-

4

duction), followed by other resonances, at higher energies, but with much less
importance. Due to the multitude of open channels in these processes, some
simplifying hypothesis have been done [9].

The process of partitioning the energy of the recoil nuclei (produced due the
interaction of the incident particle with the nucleus, placed in its lattice site) by
new interaction processes, between electrons (ionisation) and atomic motion
(displacements) is considered in the frame of the Lindhard theory [10].

3 Results and discussions

In Figure 2, the nuclear stopping power calculated for pions, protons and C and
Si ions in SiC is represented as a function of the kinetic energy of the incident
particle. The nuclear stopping power is greater for heavier incident particles:
ions compared with protons and pions respectively. In a given medium, the
position of its maximum is the same for all particles with the same charge. The
nuclear stopping power is calculated using the Lindhard Scharﬀ hypothesis [4]
for C and Si ions, so that the charge is the atomic number, in fact the maximum
charge possible.

The concentration of the primary radiation induced defects on unit ﬂuence
has been calculated starting from the following equation:

CP D (E) =

1

2Ed Z Xi

dσi
dΩ

L (ERi) dΩ

(1)

where E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle, Ed the threshold energy
for displacements in the lattice, ERi the recoil energy of the residual nucleus,
L (ERi) the Lindhard factor describing the partition between ionisation and
displacements and dσi/dΩ the diﬀerential cross section for the process respon-
sible in defect production. In the concrete calculations, all nuclear processes,
and all mechanisms inside each process are included in the summation over
index i.

The partition of the energy of the incoming particle in the semiconductor ma-
terial between ionisation and displacements has been calculated analytically,
solving the general equations of the Lindhard theory in some physical approxi-
mations. Details about the hypothesis used could be found in reference [11]. In
the particular case of the SiC, a binary compound, the Lindhard curves have
been calculated separately for each component, and the average weight Bragg
additivity has been used. In ﬁgure 3, the displacement energy versus recoil
energy for diﬀerent recoils, characterised by their charge and mass numbers,
in SiC is represented.

5

All curves start, at low energies, from the same curve; they have at low en-
ergies identical values of the energy spent into displacements, independent on
the charge and mass number of the recoil. At higher energies, the curves start
to detach from this main branch. This happens at lower energies if their charge
and mass numbers are smaller. The maximum energy transferred into displace-
ments corresponds to recoils of maximum possible charge and mass numbers
(corresponding to the heaviest element, Si in this case). The curves present
then a smooth increase with the energy. For the energy range considered here,
the asymptotic limit of the displacement energy is not reached.

For the cross sections for protons and pions interactions with carbon and
silicon experimental data and theoretical extrapolations have been used - see
references [7,12,13] and references cited therein.

As stated in Section 2, the minimum energy required to form a stable vacancy
- interstitial pair is usually called the displacement energy (Ed). The regular
nature of the crystalline lattice, conduces to its anisotropy, atoms being more
readily displaced along some directions than in others. This anisotropy is also
at the origin of diﬀerences in the rate production of defects as a function of
orientation. In the literature, both calculated and experimental values for Ed
are reported for diﬀerent crystals.

For SiC, the situation is even more complicated, and a threshold for atomic
displacements could be deﬁned for each polytype, for each atomic species, and
for each direction in the crystal.

Some calculations have been reported in the literature for Ed: by classical
molecular-dynamics simulations using empirical potentials [14], and also using
modern ﬁrst-principle methods [15], both for β SiC and 6H SiC, along some
directions of interest.

Experimental values are obtained from high voltage electron microscopy [16],
energetic ion beam spectroscopy [17], and Rutherford backscattering analysis
along diﬀerent channelling directions [17–19].

In the opinion of some authors [18], all these methods give consistent results,
the mean threshold energy for atomic displacements being of the order of 35
eV on the Si sublattice, and of the order of 20 eV on the C sublattice. These
are the values we used in the calculations.

Figure 4 presents the energy dependence of the CPD calculated (as stated
above) for pions in SiC, together with the estimated values for proton irra-
diation. In the same ﬁgure, for comparison, the CPD produced by pions and
protons in diamond [7,13] and silicon are also represented. The values corre-
sponding to protons in silicon are averages from the calculations reported in
references [20] and [21]. It could be observed that the degradations induced by

6

pions and protons are very diﬀerent and reﬂect the peculiarities of the inter-
actions of the two particles with the nuclei of the semiconductor. For pions,
the maximum of degradation is produced in the region of the ∆33 resonance,
corresponding to about 140 - 160 MeV kinetic energy. In comparison with this
behaviour, the maximum of the degradation is produced, for protons, at low
energies, and a smooth and slow decrease of the CPD is estimated with the
increase of the energy. For the energy range considered in this paper, with
the exception of the resonance region, the degradation induced by protons is
higher than that for pions in SiC. As we expected, the degradation of SiC
induced by hadrons, is between the diamond and silicon degradations.

We also evaluated the CPD for diﬀerent polytypes, and arrived at the conclu-
sion that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between their behaviour in radiation
ﬁelds. These theoretical results are in agreement with the experimental data
reported in reference [22].

4 Summary

In the present paper we reviewed the main properties of SiC in view of its
utilisation in radiation ﬁelds. In this respect, the nuclear stopping power of
pions, protons, C and Si ions in SiC has been calculated.

The Lindhard curves, characterising the partition of the recoils energy be-
tween ionisation and displacements has also been calculated, using analytical
approximations.

The concentration of primary induced defects on unit particle ﬂuence has been
calculated for the case of pion and proton irradiation, and the eﬀects of these
particles have been found intermediate in SiC between the corresponding ones
in Si and diamond.

Negligible diﬀerences have been found between the 3C, 4H and 6H polytypes
in what regards the eﬀects of pion and proton irradiations.

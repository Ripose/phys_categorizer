COMPARISONS OF HADRONIC SHOWER PACKAGES

GEORGIOS MAVROMANOLAKIS and DAVID WARD
Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB3 0HE, U.K.

We report on simulation studies comparing various hadronic shower packages. Re-
sults show that predictions from diﬀerent models vary signiﬁcantly, illustrating the
necessity of testbeam data to resolve the situation.

1 Introduction

The high precision measurements needed to exploit the physics potential of
an e+e− Future Linear Collider with 0.5 - 1 TeV center-of-mass energy range
set strict requirements on performance of vertex, tracking and calorimetric
detectors. The CALICE Collaboration [1] has been formed to conduct the
research and development eﬀort needed to bring initial conceptual designs for
the calorimetry to a ﬁnal proposal suitable for an experiment at the Future
Linear Collider. Software development and simulation studies play a key role
in this eﬀort. Some such studies are reported here.

2 Comparisons of hadronic shower models

The CALICE Collaboration proposes that both electromagnetic and hadronic
calorimeters should be highly granular to allow very eﬃcient pattern recogni-
tion for excellent shower separation and particle identiﬁcation within jets and
subsequently to provide excellent jet reconstruction eﬃciency [1,2]. Prototypes
are being constructed and simulation studies are under way to support and
guide the forthcoming testbeam program. Such studies will help to identify re-
gions where testbeams should focus to give answers, resolve discrepancies and
ﬁnally lead to a simulation code with validated and reliable predicting power.
In the following we report brieﬂy on systematic comparisons of diﬀerent
hadronic shower models. A plethora of models are available within GEANT3 [3]
and GEANT4 [4] simulation frameworks. In table 1 we give a short descrip-
tion of those we have studied. In GEANT3 several GHEISHA and FLUKA
based models are implemented. In GEANT4 all models involve GHEISHA; low
and high energy extensions with intranuclear cascade models and quark-gluon
string models respectively can be added. We simulated an electromagnetic
calorimeter longitudinally segmented into 30 layers of W of varying thickness
as absorber (the ﬁrst 10 layers at 1.4 mm thick each, 2.8 mm in the next 10 and
4.2 mm in the ﬁnal 10) interleaved with 0.5 mm Si pads as sensitive material.

Table 1: a brief line of description per studied model.

It is read out in 1 cm2 cells. The hadronic calorimeter consists of 40 layers
of Fe absorber, each 18 mm thick, equipped with scintillator tiles or resistive
plate chambers (rpc). For the latter version digital readout is envisaged. Both
versions are simulated as being read out in 1 cm2 cells. Detector geometry
and material deﬁnition were implemented identically in both frameworks and
their corresponding physics control parameters were tuned to produce the same
mip peak value for muons. Several experimentally accessible parameters pre-
dicted by the diﬀerent models were studied, such as total response, response
per detector cell, transverse and longitudinal development of showers etc. An
example, corresponding to incident π− at 10 GeV, is shown in Fig. 1. Diﬀerent
models predict signiﬁcantly diﬀerent HCAL response, Fig. 1(a), and similarly
diﬀerent shower size, Fig. 1(b). Results for both versions of HCAL are shown.
In general, our observations from such studies can be summarised by the
following: 1) predictions of FLUKA based models are deﬁnitely diﬀerent from
those of GHEISHA ones. 2) The treatment of low energy neutrons is impor-
tant especially for the scintillator HCAL and as expected has little eﬀect on
a gaseous detector (HCAL rpc). 3) Intranuclear cascade models also play a
crucial role. 4) ECAL standalone with total depth of about 1 λI may have
some discriminating power with low energy incident hadrons, as can be seen in
Fig. 2. Further detailed studies are under way, waiting to be confronted with

3 Conclusion

Simulation studies reveal signiﬁcant discrepancies among packages, thus pre-
venting model independent predictions on calorimeter performance and reliable
detector design optimization. This underlines the necessity and the importance
of an extensive testbeam program to resolve the situation and reduce the cur-
rent large uncertainty factors.

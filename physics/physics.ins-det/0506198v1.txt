We have studied the impact of charged track resolution on Higgs mass and production cross section measurement
in the process e+e− → Z 0H, Z 0 → ℓ+ℓ−, H → X for Higgs masses between 120 and 160 GeV, and on smuon
mass measurement using smuon pair production for three diﬀerent mass pairs, assuming the International Linear
Collider(ILC) is operated at 500 GeV center of mass energies (CME) with integrated luminosities of 500 f b−1. The
eﬀect of initial state radiation (ISR), beamstrahlung and beam energy spread on Higgs and smuon mass measurement
are also estimated. Using fast Monte Carlo simulations of the 2001 North American baseline detector designs (LD
and SD), we ﬁnd that the ISR and beamstrahlung have signiﬁcant impact on Higgs and smuon mass measurement;
Charged track momentum resolution aﬀect Higgs mass signiﬁcantly with better track performance yielding better
Higgs mass resolution and precision for the track momentum resolution improvement up to a factor of about 5; Track
momentum resolution has little eﬀect on the measurement precision of the Higgsstrahlung cross section, the branching
ratio of H → C ¯C, the smuon and neutralino masses; Beam energy spread better than about 0.2% has little eﬀect
on Higgs, smuon and neutralino masses; The SD detector provides a more accurate measurement than the LD of the
Higgs mass.

1. Introduction

Precise measurements of Higgs boson mass and cross section are important goals in the future high energy e + e
−
linear collider experiments [1, 2]. Precision electroweak data in the framework of the Standard Model predict the
mass of the Higgs boson, allowing a crucial cross check of electroweak symmetry breaking models if and when the
Higgs boson is discovered.
In addition, measuring the production cross section accurately allows determination
of absolute Higgs decay branching ratios. Another important goal of the ILC is to discover light supersymmetric
particles, such as sleptons, and measure their masses and production cross sections etc. Here we explore the accuracy
with which the Higgs and Higgsstrahlung cross section can be determined at a linear collider operated at 500 GeV
CME, considering Higgs masses between 120 and 160 GeV with integrated luminosities of 500 f b−1. For smuon
and neutralino mass measurement, three diﬀerent mass pairs with high(47 GeV), medium(28 GeV) and low (6 GeV)
mass diﬀerences are considered using right-hand smuon pair production, with each smuon decaying into muon and
neutralino. For this study, we use the 2001 North American baseline detector designs (LD for “Large” and SD for
“Silicon”).

2. Higgs Property Measurement

The Higgs mass can be simply determined assuming recoil in the process e+e−

X
(ℓ = e, µ). The recoil mass is deﬁned as: M recoil
ℓ+ℓ−, where s is the CME squared, Eℓ+ℓ−
is the energy of the lepton pair from Z 0 decay, while Mℓ+ℓ− is the pair’s invariant mass. The main backgrounds of
this analysis are e+e−
Z 0Z 0, W +W −, but other sources of contamination, including Bhabha events, dimuon and
two photos events are also investigated.

2.1. Event Selection

Monte Carlo events in this analysis were generated by the Pandora(V2.2)-Pythia(V3.1) package [3, 4] with latest
patches which includes initial state radiation, beamsstrahlung, beam energy spread (full width is 0.11%), hadron
fragmentation and ﬁnal state QCD/QED radiation. In addition, the electron beam is polarized to
85%. The Java
Analysis Studio(JAS) [5] package was used to analyze fast detector simulation events, assuming the LDMAR01 and
SDMAR01 baseline detectors [1].

−

These studies are performed for a Linear Collider operated at CME of 500 GeV with integrated luminosities of
500f b−1 each, assuming Higgs mass between 120 and 160 GeV. Events are selected using a cut-based approach,
according to the following criteria [6, 7]:

< 0.9

cosθe|
|

(1) A candidate lepton must have an energy greater than 10 GeV
(2) The polar angle of a lepton must satisfy
(3) There must be at least 2 lepton candidates in the event
(4) The invariant mass of the lepton pair must lie within 5 GeV of the Z 0 mass
cosθe+e−
(5) The polar angle of two-lepton system must lie in the barrel region,
|
(6) The opening angle between the two leptons should satisfy
>
|
(7) The energy of the most energetic photon should be less than 100 GeV.
Cut (5) is used to suppress Z 0Z 0 background, while Cut (6) rejects background from W +W −, Cut (7) removes
events with one energetic photon from Zγ. The selection eﬃciency for signal is about 55-57% for √s = 500 GeV,
as listed in TABLE I. The signal eﬃciency using the same selection cuts is lower, 48-50%, at a 350 GeV machine,
mainly because the lower Lorentz boost of the leptons from Z 0 decay leads to a larger average opening angle. The
major remaining background with the above selection cuts is Z 0Z 0 events for which the selection eﬃciency is about
1%. For the Z 0Z 0 cross section of 475
3.4 fb, about 2400 Z 0Z 0 events passed the selection cuts assuming the
integrated luminosity of 500 f b−1. The corresponding Higgs events in electron channel varies from about 570 to 650
for Higgs mass between 120 GeV and 160 GeV, with lower Higgs mass yielding more signal events because of larger
production cross section.

detectors, assuming ILC is operated at 500 GeV CME with Higgs masses between 120 and 160 GeV, integrated luminosity of
500 f b−1.

2.2. Higgs Mass and Cross Section Measurement

The Higgs mass resolutions are obtained by ﬁtting the peak region of Z 0 recoil mass spectra using a Gaussian
distribution. A binned χ2 ﬁt is performed with two free parameters, the Higgs mass and width. The Z 0 recoil
mass resolution is about 4-7 GeV at √s = 500 GeV for the two baseline detectors, with better resolution obtained
for the SD detector. This analytic ﬁtting technique yields slightly larger measured mass because of the ISR and
beamstrahlung. This bias can be evaluated and corrected by ﬁtting both data and Monte Carlo events with the same
techniques. The Higgs mass precision obtained using this technique is about 0.6-1.2 GeV at √s = 500 GeV, with
lower Higgs masses yielding larger uncertainties because of higher background contamination.

Figure 1: Dependence of Higgs mass resolution (a, c-logarithm scale), precision (b, d-logarithm scale) for 120 GeV Higgs
and cross section (f-120 GeV, g-140 GeV , h-160 GeV Higgs) on various track momentum resolution, e for the measured cross
sections of the Higgsstrahlung versus the Higgs mass hypothesis between 120 GeV and 160 GeV with statistical errors.

In order to improve the mass precision, a second ﬁtting technique is used, based on two Monte Carlo samples
generated using same Higgs mass hypothesis. One sample is treated as “data”, the other is Monte Carlo template,
and the recoil mass distribution from “data” sample ﬁtted to the Monte Carlo template using a binned χ2. The
free parameters are the mass and the cross section. This method automatically corrects for biases due to any eﬀects
correctly modeled in the Monte Carlo simulation, and avoids degraded precision from non-optimal analytic modeling
of resolution.

The precision of Higgs mass measured using the Monte Carlo template is about 0.3 GeV at √s = 500 GeV, with the
SD detector slightly better than LD, as shown in Table I. The cross sections of the Higgsstrahlung signal measured
for the Higgs mass between 120 and 160 GeV are shown in Table I and Figure 1.e. The relative precision of the cross
section is determined to be 6.4-7.2% at √s = 500 GeV for both baseline detectors and nominal integrated luminosity
of 500 f b−1. Slightly better precision is obtained by the SD design.

2.3. Impact of Track Momentum Resolution on Higgs Mass and Cross Section

In order to quantify the eﬀect of charged track momentum resolution on Higgs mass and cross section measurement,
the track momentum resolution is re-scaled by a factor ranging from 0.05 to 4. The results are shown in Figure 1.
The Higgs mass resolution and precision are improved by re-scaling the factor of track momentum resolution down to
about 0.2, the purity (Nsignal/(Nsignal +Nbackground)) and signiﬁcance (Nsignal/
Nbackground) of the Higgsstrahlung
signal are also saturated around that point. The cross section is insensitive to charged track momentum resolution,
with only about 10% improvement for a the track momentum resolution improvement by a factor of 10.

c¯c is 2.8% and 1.4% for 120 GeV and 140 GeV Higgs mass, respectively. In order to estimate the
ratio of H
c¯c, we assume 50% c-tagging eﬃciency, with
impact of track momentum resolution on the branching ratio of H
eﬃciencies of b quark and uds quark are 4.4% and 0.5%, respectively. The relative precision of the H
c¯c branching
ratio improves only 5-10% if we improve the track momentum resolution by a factor of 10. For integrated luminosity
of 1000 f b−1, the relative precision is about 39% for 120 GeV Higgs and 64% for 140 GeV Higgs with the nominal
track resolution.

2.5. Effect of ISR, Beamstrahlung and Beam Energy Spread on Z 0 Recoil Mass

As is well known, the ISR and beamstrahlung broaden the Z 0 recoil mass distribution and make an extremely long
tail. The ﬁnal state radiation decreases the momentum of Z 0 and makes the apparent Z 0 recoil mass larger than the
expected value. The eﬀects of ISR, beamstrahlung, beam energy spread are shown in Figure 2, assuming a 120 GeV
Higgs with SD design. As expected, the Z 0 recoil mass peaks at the correct Higgs mass if we turn oﬀ the ISR and
the beamstrahlung. For default detector designs the eﬀect of beam energy spread becomes important for a full width
larger than about 0.2%. For the current ILC500 beam setup, the eﬀect from the beam energy spread is negligible
since its full width is 0.11%.

3. Slepton and Neutralino Mass Measurement

The study of supersymmetry (SUSY) particles is one of the most important goals for the future colliders. If SUSY
exists in nature, there may be light superpartners with masses of a few hundred GeV, hence, accessible by a current
proposed ILC which is expected to run at CME of 500 GeV to 1 TeV.

One of the “golden” channels to discover the SUSY particles is pair production of slepton with each slepton decaying
into lepton and lightest SUSY particle (LSP) neutralino. The signature of these events is two energetic leptons (e
or µ) with large missing momentum. In this paper, we use the right-hand smuon pair production for smuon and
neutralino mass measurement, assuming the ILC operated at 500 GeV CME, 80% right polarization electron with
integrated luminosity of 50 f b−1. The smuon and neutralino masses can be determined by measuring endpoints of
muon energy spectrum,

where, Ecm is CME, Emin and Emax are low and high muon energy end points, respectively. For Snowmass 2001

(mSUGRA) are listed in the following, the universal scale mass m0 = 100 GeV, the universal gaugino mass m1/2 = 250
GeV, the trilinear coupling in Higgs sector A0 =

the Higgsino mixing parameter sign(µ) = +.

The dependence of muon endpoint energy on the CME is shown in the left plot of Figure 3. For CME of 500
GeV, the low and high endpoint energies are 12.32 GeV and 124.77 GeV, respectively. The muon energy spectrum
becomes wider with the increase of the CME.

The muon energy spectra for various beam setups are shown in the middle plot of Figure 3. Apparently, the
ISR and beamstrahlung distort the endpoints of muon energy spectrum signiﬁcantly. For instance, if we turn oﬀ
ISR, beamstrahlung and beam energy spread, the measured smuon and neutralino mass precisions are 260 MeV
and 167 MeV, respectively, assuming the integrated luminosity of 50 f b−1 and 20% uniform random background
contamination (20% of signal events after selection) over the full muon energy range. Then, we turn on the beam
energy spread with full width of 0.11%, the measured smuon and neutralino mass precisions are 266 MeV and 172
MeV, degraded about 3%. If we turn on all ISR, beamstrahlung and beam energy spread, the smuon and neutralino
mass precisions become 420 MeV and 294 MeV, respectively.

The dependence of the muon energy spectrum on track momentum resolution is studied and shown in the right

plot of Figure 3. Apparently, the muon energy spectra are insensitive to track momentum resolution.

versus charged track momentum resolution for high ∆M = 47 GeV

endpoint Emin although the absolute error of Emax is larger than that of Emin. No apparent improvement on smuon
and neutralino mass precision is obtained by improving the track momentum resolution. However, the mass precision
will degrade if the track momentum resolution get worse. The smuon and neutralino mass precisions are strongly
aﬀected by the background contamination. The mass precisions degrade about 15-30% when 20% uniform random
background (20% of signal events after selection) is introduced. Considering the SUSY mass error is dominated
by the relative error of Emin, it is important to reduce the background at low energy region to improve the mass
precision.

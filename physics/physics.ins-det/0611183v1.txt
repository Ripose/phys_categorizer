Abstract

A novel technique has been developed to build vessels for liquid xenon ionization detectors entirely
out of ultra-clean ﬂuoropolymer. We describe the advantages in terms of low radioactivity con-
tamination, provide some details of the construction techniques, and show the energy resolution
achieved with a prototype all-ﬂuoropolymer ionization detector.

1 Introduction

Plastics have been studied and used as
structural materials for particle detectors
requiring ultra low levels of radioactive con-
tamination for over a decade by experiments
such as Chooz [1], Palo Verde [2], SNO [3],
Borexino/CTF [4], KamLAND [5], and
MUNU [6]. In these detectors, acrylic, ny-
lon, and EVOH 4 were used for the contain-
ers of the innermost, active liquid volumes.
Because of their light weight, low atomic
mass, and production processes that involve
eﬃcient chemical separation stages, selected
plastics have generally shown very low levels
of long-lived radioactivity, particularly in
the naturally occurring isotopes 40K, 232Th,
and 238U. Polycarbonate has also been used
for cryogenic, hermetic vessels, most notably
in small bubble chambers [7], because of its
mechanical stability, strength, and compati-
bility with low temperatures. Unfortunately
all polycarbonate samples (both in the form
of raw pellets and molded plates) measured
by our group [8] have shown substantial ra-
dioactive contaminations (especially 40K),
disqualifying them for use in low background
experiments.

EXO (“Enriched Xenon Observatory”) is a
program [9] aimed at building a ton-class
double beta decay detector with xenon-136.
The plan is to use enriched xenon (80%

While the EXO collaboration is planning to
build a ton-scale detector with the ability to
retrieve and identify the Ba atom produced
in the ββ decay of 136Xe, an intermediate
scale (200 kg of enriched xenon) detec-
tor without the Ba tagging feature, called
is currently under advanced
“EXO-200”,
construction [10]. The Xe in EXO-200 (and,
possibly, in the full size EXO) is kept in liq-
uid phase (LXe) at a temperature around
170 K at a pressure of 1 atm. The two elec-
trons produced in the ββ decay are detected
in an electric ﬁeld of 1 to 4 kV/cm by the
simultaneous readout of ionization and scin-
tillation. This technique has been shown to
provide superior energy resolution [11], as
required to suppress backgrounds without
sharp energy features, such as the 2νββ de-
cay and γ-ray Compton tails. In EXO-200
the VUV scintillation light (175 nm) is de-
tected by “bare” (i.e. without their standard
encasing) large area avalanche photodiodes
(LAAPDs) 5 , while the ionization signal is
collected by crossed grids, hence measuring
the total energy of the decay and its three
dimensional location. The third dimension
is provided by the drift time using the scin-
tillation signal as a “start”. The active LXe
has the shape of a cylinder about 40 cm long
and 40 cm in diameter. The vessel with the
LXe is submerged in HFE-7000 6 contained
in a low activity, copper cryostat. The HFE-
7000 is an ultra-clean ﬂuid that is in liquid
phase in a broad range of temperatures, en-
compassing 300 K and 170 K. This ﬂuid is
used as the innermost γ and neutron shield
and thermal bath to maintain a uniform
temperature around the LXe vessel. The

presence of a large thermal mass of HFE-
7000 ﬂuid makes it possible to use xenon
containers with poor thermal conductivity
such as plastics or thin metallic shells.

The end-point energy for the 0νββ decay
in 136Xe (2457.8 keV [12]) is substantially
higher than that of most, but not all, ra-
dioactive decays in the U and Th decay
chains. In addition, 40K and other less com-
mon backgrounds are also relevant for a
clean reconstruction of the broad energy dis-
tribution originating from the 2νββ decays.
The high monetary value of the enriched
Xe makes it impractical to use it for shield-
ing the detection volume from background
events originating from the xenon vessel
material. The intrinsic background require-
ments for all construction components and,
in particular, the relatively heavy LXe ves-
sel are therefore very challenging to achieve.
Additional constraints are given by the
cryogenic temperatures and the LXe purity
requirement with respect to electronegative
contaminations, which would reduce the
electron lifetime in the detector.

In this paper we will discuss the use of a
particular ﬂuoropolymer for the construc-
tion of a large cryogenic vessel containing
the LXe. We will also present data from an
ionization chamber built entirely out of such
ﬂuoropolymer. Structural performance and
details of the construction technology used
for the chamber will be the subject of a fu-
ture publication. Although copper was ulti-
mately chosen for the ﬁrst generation EXO-
200 chamber for scheduling reasons, the de-
velopments of a ﬂuoropolymer chamber de-
scribed here may be used at a future stage
of EXO and by other groups.

2 Fluoropolymer as a vessel material

Fluoropolymers such as polytetraﬂuoroethy-
lene (PTFE) have been used in the past in
LXe detectors as a VUV reﬂector and volume
displacer [13]. It is therefore known that it
is compatible with the clean environment re-
quired to drift electrons over large distances
of LXe. In addition, ﬂuoropolymer parts are
generally known to retain their structural in-
tegrity at cryogenic temperatures. DuPont

by ﬁrst pressing ﬁne pellets in a mold and

ments conﬁrm the extremely low level of im-
purities in the material. It was found that
other batches of the same product have a
similar level of purity and that the process
of sintering, once appropriate quality control
procedures are implemented, does not ap-
preciably degrade the purity of the material.
Final parts are obtained by conventional ma-
chining followed by an etch and rinse that
remove possible surface contaminations left
by the cutting tools. Most high grades of ﬂu-
oropolymers from other suppliers were found
not to reach the purity levels observed in TE-
6472, which are among the very best ever
measured in solid materials. Detailed com-
parison of radioactive contaminants in sev-
eral plastics and many other materials will

An important property of the TE-6472 ﬂu-
oropolymer is the addition of a thermoplas-
tic ﬂuoropolymer, or modiﬁer, to the raw
PTFE in order to turn it into a weldable
material. In addition, the pelletized form of
the raw material results in a more homoge-
neous ﬁnished material than conventional
PTFE parts. The speciﬁc gravity of ﬁnished
TE-6472 is 2.2 g/cm3 (at 20 ◦C). The weld-
ing of ﬁnished parts together is carried out
by heating the material while applying sub-
stantial pressure. Weldability is essential for
our purpose since it makes it possible to
seal the vessel hermetically, without the use
of ﬂanges, gaskets, or fasteners. Substantial
amounts of material can thus be removed
from locations close to the ﬁducial volume
of the detector and the diﬃculty of sealing
the detector using materials with vastly dif-
ferent coeﬃcients of thermal expansion, (in
this case modiﬁed PTFE 8 and metals), is
eliminated. The possibility of fusing parts
together also allows for the construction of
large components from smaller elements.
This is important considering the increasing
diﬃculty of compression molding large parts
in one piece, a process that requires a high
tonnage press with substantial platen-to-
platen clearance and ram travel to accom-
modate the typical 3:1 powder compression
ratio.

from the vessel construction, are used to sup-
port and space the electrodes in the stack and

ones for lower voltage bias and signal con-
nections at the anode end of the detector to

The vessel’s construction involves several
diﬀerent welds, that are performed in a
specialized shop using ovens and localized
heater bands and plates. Each half-body is
machined from billets which are obtained by
fusing smaller molded pre-forms in an oven
in order to reach the required size. Socket
welds are then performed to connect pipes
that then transition to the metal piping of
the xenon system, as described below. The

at both ends. These commercially available
pipes are 2.5 cm and 1.9 cm in outer diam-
eter respectively, with a wall thickness of
3 mm. They have similar welding properties
but were not screened for radioactivity. The
ability to make long pipes from TE-6472
was developed for later prototypes. Two
pipes (inlet and outlet) are included in order
to have inline recirculation and puriﬁcation
of the xenon because of the expected out-
gassing of electronegative impurities from
the ﬂuoropolymer walls of the vessels. As
discussed below,
it was later found that
Xe puriﬁcation is not necessary. Moreover,
having access to the detector via two pipes
allows one to route the cable for the high

and 2) is then inserted into the vessel that is
subsequently closed with a ﬁeld weld using
a hot clamp. In the vessel shown in ﬁgure 1
the ﬁeld weld is made using a disk-like fea-
ture designed to have enough compliance to
accommodate rather large thermal distor-
tions during the weld. The temperature in-
side the ﬂuoropolymer cell is monitored with
resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)
during the welding cycle and kept below
150 ◦C. Speciﬁc problems were observed
with a drastic reduction in the quantum
eﬃciency of the LAAPDs at 175 nm, after
they had been sealed inside the welded ﬂu-
oropolymer chambers. Although a substan-
tial array of high sensitivity surface analyses
failed to show ﬂuorine contamination on the
LAAPDs active face, a speciﬁc geometry
of the ﬁeld weld (ﬁg. 3), designed with lo-
calized water cooling and able to eﬃciently
ﬂush gases produced in the welding process
and to isolate the LAAPDs from the welded
region, completely eliminates the problem.
We note that the bare LAAPDs have been
found to be, by far, the components most
sensitive to welding fumes. Thin wire grids
and meshes made of diﬀerent metals appear
to be substantially less sensitive to this issue.

Because of the relatively large permeabil-
ity of ﬂuoropolymers to He at room tem-
perature, leak checking of the ﬁnished ves-
sels with He leak detectors requires some
care. Experience has shown, however, that
the onset of the signal from diﬀusion, for ﬂu-
oropolymers of any reasonable thickness, is
much slower than that of a real leak, so that
a clear discrimination between the two phe-
nomena is easily achieved. It was generally
found that the ﬂuoropolymer vessels with
their welds and ﬂuoropolymer plumbing are
very reliable and He leak tight even after sev-
eral cycles from room temperature to 170 K.
Typical leak rates < 10−4 cm3 mbar s−1 are

by pressing a modiﬁed Curvac ﬂange 10 onto
a carefully machined ﬂat surface of the TE-
6472 material, as schematically shown in
ﬁgure 4. Using a linear pressure of 82 kg/cm,
the circular cross section of the Curvac fea-
ture penetrates the ﬂuoropolymer up to
about half of its radius. A stack of elastic
washers insures a constant force against the
seal as materials contract or expand and,
over long periods of time, creep (in the case
of ﬂuoropolymers). Note that, as tempera-

top ﬂange of the cryostat. All wiring goes
through the transitions and onto conven-
tional metal-ceramic feedthroughs branch-
ing oﬀ the xenon feed lines. We note that
because of the poor heat conduction of ﬂu-
oropolymers, a large chamber built with
this technique would require an external Xe
condenser.

4 Permeation of HFE-7000 in ﬂuo-

ropolymers

Permeation of HFE-7000 through the ﬂuo-
ropolymer walls of the chambers was thor-
oughly investigated because of the possible
implications in terms of electronegative con-
tamination of the LXe. Long term perme-
ation measurements were undertaken in two
ﬂuoropolymers (DuPont PFA-440HP and
3M modiﬁed PTFE TFM-1700) before TE-
6472 ﬂuoropolymer was selected as the most
suitable candidate material for a LXe vessel.

Dog-bone-shaped samples, 1.6 mm-thick, 38
mm long, and 15 mm wide were immersed
in HFE-7000 at room temperature and their
weight recorded as a function of time, until
saturation was reached. Data for TFM-1700
and PFA-440HP are shown in ﬁg. 6: full sat-
uration is reached after 1.5 and 5 months re-
spectively. Data were analyzed assuming a
purely diﬀusive intake into a slab with inﬁ-
nite, parallel walls. This assumes that HFE-
7000 intake through the edges of the sample,
which constitute
15% of the exposed sur-
face, is negligible. The eﬀect of such approx-
imation is to overestimate the permeation
rate, yielding a slightly conservative result.
The solution for the fractional weight gain
versus time λ(t) is (see e.g. [16] for a deriva-

tional (metal-ceramics), mounted after the ﬂu-

ture changes, the curvac feature “glides” ra-
dially on the ﬂuoropolymer surface, without
apparent loss of the seal. Transitions built
with this technique have been shown to work
reliably between 380 and 170 K even after
several temperature cycles. Although the
transitions are rather bulky, where radioac-
tive backgrounds are a concern they can be
located far away from the active region of the
detector, by providing long ﬂuoropolymer
tubes to move them behind shielding mate-
rial (HFE-7000 in the EXO-200 design).

A chamber built with the present technique
is shown in ﬁg. 5. The ﬂuoropolymer parts of
the ﬂuoropolymer-to-metal transitions are
visible at the ends of the pipes. Electrical
wires, insulated with PFA 11 jackets are also
visible (in plastic bags to maintain cleanli-
ness). The tube with the “U” bend is located
at the bottom of the cryostat containing the
cold HFE-7000 and the two ﬂuoropolymer-

Samples of TFM-1700 and PFA-440HP were
also tested, with limited accuracy, for perme-

sidered for use in EXO-200. It was found
that, for both plastics, S

in TFM-1700, consistent with PFA-440HP
being less permeable than TFM-1700. Per-
meation tests were also performed on TFM-
1700 samples cooled down to -10 ◦C. While
saturation had not yet been reached at the
time of writing, data suggest that S is larger
by possibly
50%, while the diﬀusion coef-
ﬁcient is more than ten times smaller than
at room temperature. TE-6472 is a modiﬁed
PTFE much like TFM-1700, and the perme-
ation properties of the two are expected to be
similar. Short term tests were performed in
order to compare TE-6472 and TFM-1700,
showing a

10% lower value for TE-6472.

As a ﬁnal, crucial test, a sample of TE-6472
soaked in HFE-7000 was inserted in a LXe
cell, operated as a xenon purity monitor.
The cell, similar to the one described in [17],
has a long drift region, which allows it to
measure electron drift times up to 4 ms.
After the sample was inserted into it, the
cell was evacuated and cooled down prior
to xenon liquefaction. The intensity of the
HFE-7000 mass peaks was measured versus
temperature, providing information on the

of impurity speciﬁcally attributable to the

electron lifetime.

The intake of ﬂuorinated ﬂuids causes ﬂu-
oropolymers to swell and deteriorates their
mechanical properties. Our study shows
that TFM-1700 and PFA-440HP linearly
expand
3% when saturated with FC-87
or HFE-7100. A two-fold reduction of their
bulk modulus and yield strength is also ob-
served; such degradation is largest for TFM-

in HFE-7100.

5 Operation of an all-ﬂuoropolymer
liquid xenon ionization chamber

As illustrated in ﬁgures 1 and 2 , the ioniza-
tion chamber consists of an LAAPD package
and 3 horizontal stainless steel structures
stacked vertically, submersed in 0.5 liters
of LXe. Ionization electrons are created in
the volume between the lowest plane (cath-
ode) and the grid directly above it and are
collected by an anode behind the grid. The
cathode consists of a solid stainless steel
plate, whereas the grid and anode are made
of electroformed nickel meshes with 90%
optical transparency, mounted on stainless
steel rings. Good electron transparency is
obtained by maintaining the anode-to-grid
ﬁeld at twice the value of the drift ﬁeld.
Three LAAPDs, located above the anode
plane, detect scintillation photons. However
in the measurements shown here, the qual-
ity of the signals from the LAAPDs was
rather poor because of the damage caused
by the early welding process. Therefore
LAAPD signals were only used for trigger-
ing and timing purposes and not for energy
reconstruction. Later welding tests, that
preserved the full functionality of LAAPDs,
were performed,
in setups
with no grid structure.

After seal-welding the vessel and connecting
it to the Xe feed and recovery systems, the
entire system is baked at 380 K under vac-
uum for several days. During this operation
the interior of the cryostat is purged with Ar
so that no air or water vapor can diﬀuse into
the walls of the ﬂuoropolymer vessel and,
eventually, contaminate the xenon. After the
system is returned to room temperature, the
Ar in the cryostat is replaced with HFE-7000
and cooling is started. Commercial xenon is
puriﬁed by passing it through an Oxisorb R

obtain a relatively pure sample of internal
conversion (IC) electrons which all interact
in very close proximity to the source. The
electron signal at the anode was detected by
a low noise, charge-sensitive Amptek A250
preampliﬁer, shaped with a Canberra model
2020 spectroscopy ampliﬁer, sampled with
a transient digitizer, and recorded. Special
care is required to reduce pick-up noise. An
all-ﬂuoropolymer vessel, with no intrinsic
metallic shield around the electrodes. is an
unconventional layout for an ionization de-
tector. Proper grounding and shielding must
be provided by other means (for instance,
by the cryostat enclosure).

In the oﬀ-line analysis charge signals are ﬁt
to the following 5-parameter model of the
drift to the anode of a Gaussian ionization
distribution:

t0

A σ

erf
"

 

√2σ ! −

erf

−

t + t0
√2σ !#

 

−t+t0

e

τ +B.

Here A is the amplitude, t0 the eﬀective
drift-time, σ the rise-time parameter, τ the
integrator fall-time, and B a vertical oﬀset.
The readout was calibrated in units of elec-
tron charge by injecting a signal into the pre-
ampliﬁer through a 1 pF calibrated capaci-
tor. The electronic noise of the pre-ampliﬁer
was found to follow a Gaussian distribution
with standard deviation of 597 electrons.
Data acquisition is triggered when a delayed
coincidence between scintillation and ioniza-
tion signals is observed. The delay accounts
for the drift velocity of electrons and varies
with electric ﬁeld. The selection of IC events,
which occur along the main axis of the ion-
ization cell, alleviates the eﬀects of possible
non-uniformities in the electric ﬁeld across
the active volume of the detector, which is
not equipped with ﬁeld-shaping electrodes.

a drift ﬁeld of 1.5 kV/cm. The two peaks cor-
respond to the two internal conversion e− lines
from the 207Bi source, at 570 keV and 1064 keV
(K-shell electron events at 975 keV are also vis-
ible as a shoulder to the 1064 keV peak). In
order to evaluate the energy resolution at 570
keV, the data is ﬁt to a Gaussian plus a straight
line as shown. The higher energy peak is not in-
cluded in the ﬁt. The horizontal axis shows the
amplitude of the pulse in arbitrary units.

quate for this test. All the data shown here
was taken between 165.5 and 171 K and be-

Ionization in the LXe is produced by both
the 570 keV and 1064 keV γ ray lines fol-
lowing the β decay of 207Bi as well as by
internal conversion electrons. The source
is prepared as a monoatomic layer of ra-
dioactive Bi electroplated onto a 25 mm2
piece of electroformed nickel mesh, which is
then spot-welded to the cathode plate. The
data presented here were collected at drift
ﬁelds of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.5 kV/cm.

time. Because of the very low radioactive
contaminations in the special ﬂuoropolymer
variety discussed here, this exotic technique
has great promise for low background ex-
periments.

the 207Bi spectrum is ﬁt to a Gaussian plus a
straight line as shown. The noise-subtracted
energy resolution is shown as a function of
the drift ﬁeld in ﬁgure 9. Such resolution
for 570 keV is found to be σ/E = 5.1% at
1.5 kV/cm, in good quantitative agreement
with the results obtained by our group and
others using conventional construction tech-
niques [18].

The chamber described here was run for
10 days without re-puriﬁcation of the LXe.
No degradation of the signal amplitude or
of the resolution was observed.

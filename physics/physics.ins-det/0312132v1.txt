Abstract

With a total area of 210 squaremeters and about 15000 single silicon modules the silicon strip tracker
of the CMS experiment at the LHC will be the largest silicon strip detector ever built. While the per-
formance of the individual mechanical and electronic components has already been tested extensively,
their interplay in larger integrated substructures also has to be studied before mass production can be
launched, in order to ensure the envisaged performance of the overall system. This is the main purpose
of the system tests, during which hardware components as ﬁnal as possible are being integrated into
substructures of the tracker subsystems. System tests are currently being carried out for all subsystems
of the tracker. In addition, silicon modules and electronic components have been operated and studied
in a particle beam environment. In this report results from the CMS silicon tracker system tests and a
test beam experiment at CERN are presented.

1 The CMS Silicon Strip Tracker

The CMS silicon strip tracker is divided into four subsystems: the Tracker Inner Barrel and Inner Disks (TIB and
TID), the Tracker Outer Barrel (TOB) and the Tracker End Caps (TEC). The modularity of the system can be seen
in Fig. 1, where one quarter of the detector is shown in the longitudinal view. The total tracker will be cooled to
an operating temperature of –10◦ C. A detailed description of the layout of the silicon strip tracker is available in
Ref. [1] and references therein.
Silicon modules mounted within a radial distance of 60 cm from the beam line have 320 µm thick sensors, while
the sensors of all outer modules have a thickness of 500 µm. Single- and double-sided modules are used, the latter
being made of two single-sided modules mounted back-to-back with a stereo angle of 100 mrad. The sensor design
is described in Ref. [2].
The TIB consists of four cylindrical layers. Each layer is constructed out of two carbon ﬁber (CF) half-shells per
beam (z) direction. Strings carrying three thin modules are mounted inside and outside of the layer surfaces.
The TOB is composed of six cylindrical layers. The basic structure of the TOB is a rod: a CF support frame, which
carries either three double-sided (layers 1-2) or three single-sided (layers 3-6) thick modules on each side.
Finally, each of the two endcaps of the TEC consists of nine CF disks. On each disk 16 petals, wedge shaped CF
support plates which carry up to 28 modules arranged in seven radial rings, are mounted.
The readout is based on the APV25 chip[3] built in radiation hard 0.25 µm CMOS technology. This 128 channels
chip implements a charge-sensitive ampliﬁer, a shaper and a 192 cells pipeline (3.2 µs long). Two operation modes
can be chosen: in peak mode only one data sample is processed, while in deconvolution mode three consecutive
samples are summed with weights. This leads to a much shorter pulse and thus to correct bunch crossing identiﬁ-
cation in the high luminosity phase of the LHC. The signals of two chips are multiplexed onto one data line and
converted to optical ones in Analog Opto-Hybrids (AOHs)[4]. The data are then transmitted to the control room,
where VMEbus readout boards called Front End Drivers[5] (FEDs) provide opto-electrical conversion, digitization
and zero-suppression.
The monitoring and control is handled by Front End Controller (FEC) VMEbus cards, which communicate via
a digital optical link[4] in a token ring protocol with dedicated Communication and Control Units (CCU25)[6]
mounted on the string/rod/petal motherboards. These chips distribute the control signals to the addressed modules,
while trigger and clock signals are propagated to Phase Locked Loop (PLL) chips on the front-end hybrids.

2 Results from System Tests and the May 2003 Beam Test
System tests are currently being carried out for all subsystems of the tracker: for the TOB at CERN, for the
TIB/TID in Florence and Pisa and for the TEC in Aachen and Lyon. Both electrical behaviour, with emphasis
on the noise and signal-to-noise performance, and the cooling performance are being studied and the design is
qualiﬁed or optimized, if necessary.
For the TIB and TEC the most complete system tests up to now have been realized in a test beam environment at
CERN during May 2003. The X5 beam in the CERN West Area provided muons and/or pions (p = 120 GeV/c for
pions). The beam had a LHC-like time structure, with about 3 nsec long particle bunches, spaced by 25 nsec time
periods.
The main difference between test beam and system test setups and the ﬁnal CMS readout and control chains is that

(ﬁlled histogram) and room temperature (blank histogram). All runs were taken in peak mode.

currently PCI mezzanine cards (PMC) are used for readout and control (PMCFED[7] and PMCFEC) instead of
the ﬁnal VMEbus cards. These PMC have no implementation of optical conversion, thus additional opto-electrical
converters are necessary.
In the following the setups of the TEC and TIB beam tests and the TOB laboratory system test, along with ﬁrst
preliminary results, are described.

2.1 Test Beam Data Acquisition

In the test beam the most recent DAQ software, based on the XDAQ[8] framework, was used. For the ﬁrst time,
a prototype of the ﬁnal run control[9] was available, and an online monitoring programme provided immediate
feedback on the performance. For each subsystem (TIB, TOB, TEC) optical transmission of data as well as timing
and control signals between the control room and the beam area was realized. Each subsystem used one PC with a
PMCFEC and a second PC housing two or three PMCFEDs and a Trigger Sequencer Card, which distributed the
particle trigger and the clock from the TTC system[10] to the FEC and the FEDs.
The commissioning of the individual subsystems was ﬁnished within about two hours. This included the tuning of
the optimal FED sampling point, the adjustment of the timing difference between individual channels due to their
different positions in the trigger distribution path, the optimization of AOH parameters (adjustment of the laser
diode gain and bias current, to be repeated for each temperature change) and ﬁnally trigger latency and PLL delay
scans to ﬁnd the physics signal (the sampling point which gives the highest signal to noise). Automatized proce-
dures are implemented in the software for all these tasks. Mostly the TIB, TEC and TOB subsystems were read
out independently of each other, but ﬁnally the TIB and TOB DAQ systems were merged and the two subdetectors
read out coherently like a single detector after only a few hours of commissioning. This shows the scalability and
commissioning capability of the DAQ software.

2.2 The Tracker End Cap Beam Test

For the ﬁrst time a prototype of a TEC petal, equipped with nine modules (four thin single-sided modules on ring
four, four thick single-sided modules on ring six, plus one thick double-sided module on ring ﬁve), was studied
in a test beam. Twelve front-end hybrids plus AOHs were distributed on the remaining positions. The petal was
cooled via its own cooling pipe system and was kept inside a thermally and electrically isolated passive cooling
box, ﬂushed with dry nitrogen. Temperature and humidity inside the box were monitored and an interlock on the
low voltage was implemented. Floating power supplies (not of the ﬁnal design) were used for low voltage and
also for high voltage to bias the detectors. Both low and high voltages were transmitted to the petal via 45 m long
cables of the ﬁnal design.
The system showed excellent performance in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The S/N distributions of all
modules have been studied in peak mode running for a bias voltage of 350 V and an operating temperature of 0◦ C.
In Fig. 2 (a) two examples are shown: S/N Landau peaks of 27 and 39 are found for a thin and a thick module,
respectively. In Fig. 2 (b) the S/N of the same thick (ring ﬁve) module is compared for running at 0◦ C and at room
temperature, under otherwise identical conditions. The S/N is increased signiﬁcantly when the module is operated
at 0◦ C, compared to operation at room temperature, where a S/N of only 33.5 is measured.
Figure 3 shows the results of bias voltage scans. For a ring four module a plateau in S/N is reached for a voltage of
190 V. A double-sided ring ﬁve module consists of two single-sided modules, each with two daisy-chained wafers,
mounted with a stereo angle. For the two sensors of one single-sided ring ﬁve module the plateau voltages are
264 V and 265 V. It was possible to distinguish between the two sensors since the stereo angle was exploited to

3

calculate the radial coordinate along the strip direction. In this way the clusters can be assigned to the individual
sensors. The plateau voltage is higher than the depletion voltage, since charge collection is incomplete without
signiﬁcant overdepletion. High plateau voltages at the start ensure that after type inversion due to irradiation only
moderate bias voltages must be applied to maintain full efﬁciency.

2.3 The Tracker Inner Barrel Beam Test

The TIB test beam setup consisted of a part of a half-shell of layer three with four strings. Two of these strings
were equipped with three single-sided thin modules each, while the CCU25 and the mothercable were mounted
for all four strings. The TIB setup was thermally stabilized at room temperature. Temperature and humidity were
monitored and interfaced to an interlock system. Two different protoypes of the ﬁnal control room power supplies
(from CAEN and LABEN), supplying both low and high voltage, as well as a 125 m long low inductance power
cable of the ﬁnal design were studied for their noise behaviour, and exhibited excellent performance.
The noise of the system was found to be very low. The common mode subtracted noise of a typical TIB module
is shown in Fig. 4 (a). The mean common mode subtracted noise is only 0.97 ADC counts. In Fig. 4 (b) the
dependence of the number of noisy strips of one module on the bias voltage is shown. The number of noisy strips
is very small and stable.
The signal pulse shape, measured with a muon beam, has been reconstructed in peak and deconvolution mode.
While in peak mode a (slightly adjustable) peaking time of about 55 nsec is found, in deconvolution mode the
pulse is much sharper and the peaking time is below 20 nsec. This is known to be achieved at the cost of a lower
S/N. However, with a typical Landau peak of 18 (for 300 V bias voltage), the S/N in deconvolution mode is still
sufﬁciently high. In peak mode a S/N of about 26 is measured.

2.4 The Tracker Outer Barrel System Test

The system test of the TOB is in a very advanced state. The system test of a single-sided rod is ﬁnished and the
design has been validated. Currently a double-sided rod equipped with twelve r–φ modules is under test at CERN,
and a CMS Note summarizing the results is in preparation.
The noise performance of the rod was tested extensively. A comparison between a single module setup, consisting

of a bare module, and the rod setup equipped with the same module shows compatible noise and common mode
both in peak and deconvolution mode.
To test the TOB modules with real particles, a cosmic test stand has been realized. With this setup a S/N of 26 is
measured in deconvolution mode.
For faster measurements, important during the mass production phase, the modules are exposed to a 106
44 Ru β-
source, which provides electrons with a maximal energy of 3.5 MeV and a trigger rate of 500 Hz. For electrons,
the S/N is typically 33 in peak mode and 21 in deconvolution mode (Fig. 5). The difference in S/N for cosmic
muons and electrons is mainly due to the different mean path lengths in the silicon. The double-sided modules have
been exploited to calculate the hit efﬁciency, which is found to be as high as 99.8 %. First tracking and alignment
studies at the overlap of two double-sided modules were already carried out.

3 Conclusions
The system tests of the TEC, TIB and TOB subdetectors of the CMS silicon strip tracker are in an advanced state.
Increasingly more complex substructures are being integrated and studied in laboratory system tests as well as in
test beam experiments. Up to now the design has been proven to work very well, exhibiting low noise and excellent
signal-to-noise ratio performance. In the TEC system test a full petal will be integrated until the end of the year,
while for the TIB the next step is the integration of four full single-sided strings. Mass production of silicon strip
modules has started, and the ﬁrst fully equipped substructures will be installed on the disk and barrel structures in
the ﬁrst half of 2004.

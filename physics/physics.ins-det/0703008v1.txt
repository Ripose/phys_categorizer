Abstract

In this work, we have computed the three dimensional weighting potential,
ﬁeld and pad response function (PRF) of typical time projection chambers
(TPC) using a recently formulated and developed boundary element method
solver, namely, the nearly exact BEM solver. A realistic geometry of the device
is found to have signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the estimation of signal generation.

Introduction

Over the last three decades, the time projection chamber (TPC) [1] has been consid-
ered as one of the important and successful gas detectors, especially in accelerator
based experiments. The signal in a TPC can be estimated using the Shockley-Ramo
[2, 3] theorem following which the electric and weighting ﬁelds turn out to be two
fundamental quantities.

In this work, we have computed the weighting potential of a typical TPC using a
recently developed boundary element method (BEM) solver, namely, the nearly ex-
act BEM (neBEM) solver [4, 5]. Weighting potential, ﬁeld and pad response function
of TPC-s of realistic geometries have been accurately estimated using this solver.
Results for a two-dimensional strip detector for which an analytic solution exists
(thereby neglecting the presence of the anode wires altogether) or those obtained
by using elegantly derived semi-empirical expressions [6], cannot be considered to
be accurate for all possible geometries. As is evident from our results, presence of
the anode wires and three-dimensionality of the detectors do alter the weighting
potential considerably.

In this regard, the ﬁnite element method (FEM) packages (commercial or oth-
erwise) are known to perform poorly in spite of consuming large amount of compu-
tational resources. On the other hand, conventional BEM solvers are also known to
suﬀer from several drawbacks. In the present formulation, many of the drawbacks
of BEM have been removed and, as a result, the neBEM solver can be used very

eﬀectively to solve for problems related to estimating the electrostatic conﬁguration
of TPCs.

2 Background

According to the Shockley-Ramo theorem, the current induced at time t on an
electrode due to a charge at position ~r can be evaluated as follows:

i(t) = q~v ~Ew
(1)
where q represents the charge, ~v is its velocity and ~Ew is the weighting ﬁeld at ~r
associated with the electrode under study. Similarly, PRF is also used for estimating
signal induced on cathode pads. It is necessary to be able to compute the mentioned
parameters to an acceptable accuracy in 3D. It may be mentioned here that the ﬁnal
aspects of signal generation can be very eﬀectively modeled by Garﬁeld [7].

3 Results and discussions

3.1 Comparison with analytical solutions

A simple closed-form expression for the weighting potential exists for a 2D strip
detector with no gap between strips. It can be written as [8]

Φ(x, y) =

(arctan(tanh(β) · tan(γ)) − arctan(tanh(α) · tan(γ)))

The surface plots of weighting potentials obtained using the neBEM solver have
been presented in ﬁg.1(a). Qualitatively, the comparison with the analytic result [8]
is found to be very satisfactory.

3.2 Eﬀect of the presence of anode wires

In order to estimate the eﬀect of anode wires on the electrostatic conﬁguration, we
have included a plane of wires within the simple geometry considered above (termed
wired).

The weighting potential along Y for the unwired simple detector naturally matches
perfectly with the exact solution. The wired detector, however, has a signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent weighting potential distribution throughout, the diﬀerence being very large
near the anode wire (ﬁg.1(b)). This is logical because the anode wire provides a
new zero potential surface. This deviation creates a large electric ﬁeld, Ey, near the
anode wire which, naturally, inﬂuences the generated signal. Thus, it is noted,that
the naive use of analytic expressions may lead to non-negligible errors.

3.3 Computations for a realistic TPC

Next, we have considered a realistic TPC where the surface representation of the
cathode wire plane has been corrected. We have also considered gaps between seg-
ments in this geometry. In the idealized TPC, we have ignored these gaps. As prelim-
inary estimation, we have computed the one-dimensional PRF using the weighting
ﬁeld distribution and presented the results for the two TPCs in ﬁg.2(a). It can be
seen that omission of gaps between segments of the cathode plane can lead to small,
but ﬁnite, error in estimating the PRF as well.

3.4 Three dimensional eﬀects

In ﬁg.2(b), we show a comparison between the weighting potentials of a 2D strip
detector (analytic solution), the same at the mid-plane of a realistic (anode wires
added to the analytic geometry) TPC detector, in addition to the values obtained at
the edges of the same realistic TPC detector. The signiﬁcant amount of diﬀerence
between the mid-plane and the edge values is immediately apparent. This diﬀer-
ence emphasizes even more the importance of precise computation of electrostatic
conﬁguration for a TPC.

4 Conclusion

Accurate 3D weighting potential and ﬁelds have been calculated using the recently
developed neBEM solver. Now, it should be easy for us to simulate the charge
/ signal induced on any electrode of a detector due to the passage of an ionizing
particle passing through a detector by calculating the real ﬁeld within the detector
(can be done using the present solver) and the drift velocity (can be done using [7]).

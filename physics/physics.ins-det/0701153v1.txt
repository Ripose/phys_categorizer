Abstract

The main task of the Target Tracker detector of the long baseline neutrino oscillation
OPERA experiment is to locate in which of the target elementary constituents, the lead/emulsion
bricks, the neutrino interactions have occurred and also to give calorimetric information
about each event. The technology used consists in walls of two planes of plastic scintilla-
tor strips, one per transverse direction. Wavelength shifting ﬁbres collect the light signal
emitted by the scintillator strips and guide it to both ends where it is read by multi-anode
photomultiplier tubes. All the elements used in the construction of this detector and its main
characteristics are described.

Key words: OPERA, Target Tracker, plastic scintillator, photomultiplier, PMT,

1 Introduction

OPERA [1] is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment designed to detect the appearance
of ντ in a pure νµ beam in the parameter region indicated by the anomaly in the atmospheric
neutrino ﬂux. The detector is installed at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in
a cavern excavated under the Gran Sasso in the Italian Abruzzes. The cavern (Hall C) is in the
line of sight of the CNGS beam of neutrinos originating from CERN, Geneva, at a distance of
730 km. The beam energy has been optimized to maximize the number of ντ CC interactions.
The commissioning of the beam and of the electronic components of the detector has started in
August 2006. The data taking is due to start in spring 2007 and to last for ﬁve years.
23 = 2.5 10−3 eV2 and full νµ − ντ mixing (sin2 2θ23 = 1), as
At the nominal value of ∆m2
measured by the Super–Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment [2], OPERA will observe
about 20 ντ CC interactions after 5 years of data taking, with an estimated background of only
1 event.

The OPERA detector consists of two identical super–modules. Each super–module has a 0.9-
kton instrumented target followed by a 10 × 8 m2 dipolar magnetic muon spectrometer. One
target is the repetition of 31 6.7 × 6.7 m2 modules each including a proper target wall followed
by a tracker wall. A target wall is an assembly of 52 horizontal trays, each of which is loaded
with 64 bricks of 8.3 kg each. A brick is made of 56 lead sheets, 1 mm thick, providing the
necessary mass, interleaved with 57 nuclear emulsion ﬁlms that provide the necessary sub–
millimeter spatial resolution required to detect and separate unambiguously the production and
decay vertices of the τ − lepton produced in charged current ντ interactions with the lead nuclei.
The bricks in which neutrino interactions have occurred, typically 30 per day at the nominal
beam intensity, are identiﬁed by the event reconstruction in the trackers and the spectrometers.
They will be extracted on a regular basis, disassembled and the emulsion ﬁlms will be scanned
and analyzed by a battery of high speed, high resolution automatic microscopes in order to
locate the interaction vertex and search for candidates of τ − lepton decay.
The main role of the Target Tracker is therefore to locate the lead/emulsion brick where a neu-
trino interaction has occurred. It will also provide a neutrino interaction trigger for the readout
of the whole OPERA detector and be used as a calorimeter for the event analysis.

The required high brick ﬁnding efﬁciency puts strong requirements on the Target Tracker spa-
tial resolution and track detection efﬁciency. The replacement of faulty elements of the Target
Tracker is extremely difﬁcult and this detector must therefore present a long term stability and
reliability (at least for 5 years which is the expected OPERA data taking period). In case of
problems, the brick ﬁnding efﬁciency not only of the bricks just in front of the concerned zone,
but also of several walls upstream will severely be affected. The sensitive surface to be covered
being of the order of 2 × 3000 m2, a cost effective technology had to be used.

2 Overview of the Target Tracker

The technology selected to instrument the targets of the OPERA detector consists in scintillator
strips, 6.86 m long, 10.6 mm thick, 26.3 mm wide, read on both sides using Wave Length

2

Shifting (WLS) ﬁbres and multi-anode photomultipliers (PMT). The particle detection principle
is depicted by Fig. 1. The scintillator strips used have been produced by extrusion, with a T iO2
co-extruded reﬂective and diffusing coating for better light collection. A long groove running
on the whole length and at the center of the scintillating strips, houses the WLS ﬁbre which
is glued inside the groove using a high transparency glue. This technology is very reliable due
to the robustness of its components. Delicate elements, like electronics and PMT’s are located
outside the sensitive area where they are accessible.

A basic unit (module) of the target tracker consists of 64 strips readout by WLS ﬁbres coupled
to two 64–channel photodetectors. The 64 strips of the module are glued on the surrounding alu-
minium sheets that serve as covers (the strips are not glued together). In this way, the mechanical
strength of the module is provided by the strips themselves, the covers and the end–caps. The
ﬁbres are directly routed at both ends to the photodetectors through the end–caps (Fig. 2).
Four such modules are assembled together to construct a tracker plane covering the 6.7 ×6.7 m2
sensitive surface deﬁned by the target brick walls. One plane of 4 horizontal modules and one
plane of 4 vertical modules form a tracker wall providing 2D track information (Fig. 3). The total
OPERA target contains 62 walls, 31 per super–module. Thus, the total number of scintillating
strips is 31744 for 63488 electronic channels.

Target Tracker walls hanging in between two brick walls are shown schematically by Fig. 4, the
walls are suspended on the OPERA main I–beams independently of the brick walls. The vertical
modules are suspended on a ﬂat beam (10 mm thick, 30 cm wide and 8.24 m long) which is
hanged directly on the main I–beams of the OPERA detector supporting structure, while for the
horizontal modules only the ﬁrst one is suspended at the two ends on the ﬂat beam while the
other three modules are suspended on one another. The end–caps of the horizontal modules are
rigid enough to support the other modules.

The minimum total wall thickness in the sensitive area covered by the emulsion bricks is
28.8 mm. The dead space induced by the gap between modules, the mechanical tolerance be-

tween strips of 0.1 mm and the scintillator strip T iO2 wrapping (0.15 mm thick) is of the order
of 1.5% of the overall sensitive surface.

A description of the main components entering the Target Tracker construction is given in this
section. More information can be found in the Target Tracker Technical Design Report [4].

3 Components

3.1 Plastic Scintillator Strips

The transverse geometry of the plastic scintillator strips is shown in Fig. 5. The scintillator strips
have been extruded, with a co-extruded T iO2 reﬂective coating for improved light collection, by
the AMCRYS-H company 2 . The WLS ﬁbre is glued with high transparency glue in a machined
groove, 2.0 mm deep and 1.6 mm wide, which runs along the strip length. The plastic scintillator
is composed of polystyrene with 2% of p-Terphenyl, the primary ﬂuor, and 0.02% of POPOP,
the secondary ﬂuor. Fig. 6 [5] shows the absorption and emission spectra of the ﬂuors.

Several plastic scintillator strips produced by different companies have been tested by irradi-
ation of the strips (Fig. 7) with electrons of 1.8 MeV energy selected from a 10 mCi 90Sr β
source by a purposely developed compact magnetic spectrometer (Fig. 8). The electron trigger
at the exit of the spectrometer is provided by a 0.1 mm thick scintillator read at both ends by two
PMT’s in coincidence. The signal was read-out by two Hamamatsu bialkali PMT’s H3164-10
through the WLS ﬁbre. A correction factor of 1.19 was applied to the measurements to ex-
press the signal in terms of the number of photoelectrons (p.e) resulting from the 2.15 MeV

Fig. 9 presents the number of p.e versus the distance from the two PMT’s for several samples
provided by AMCRYS-H company. In the worst case where the particle crosses the strip at its
middle (4.5 m distance from each PMT), the number of observed p.e is well above 4 (lower
limit requested by the experiment), inducing a particle detection efﬁciency higher than 99%.

Primary photons produced in the strip by an ionizing particle make several reﬂections on the
strip surface before entering the WLS ﬁbre. To evaluate the distribution of the distance between
the point of emission and the entry point in the ﬁbre, the long WLS ﬁbre was replaced by a short
segment of 3 cm glued at both ends to clear ﬁbres. By varying the position of the spectrometer
with respect to the center of the WLS ﬁbre segment, the measured light yield shown by Fig. 10
was observed. A gaussian distribution has been ﬁtted to the data with a standard deviation of
2.3 cm. Taking into account the WLS ﬁbre length, the standard deviation of the light expansion
distribution has been calculated to be about 2.2 cm.

have been used.

3.2 Wavelength Shifting Fibres

The attenuation length has been measured for several 1 mm diameter double cladding WLS
ﬁbres commercially available from Bicron 3 , Kuraray 4 and PoL.Hi.Tech 5 . The ﬁbres were
inserted into a 1 mm diameter hole machined in a NE110 scintillator excited by an H2 UV lamp.
Fig. 11 shows the collected light intensity versus the distance between the PMT (Hamamatsu
bialkali H3164-10) and the illumination point for the Y11(175)MJ non S ﬁbre from Kuraray,
which was the ﬁnal choice for this detector. The equivalent number of p.e is just indicative. The
ﬁtted curve is the sum of two exponential distributions: e2.59−x/λs + e2.29−x/λl with λs = 79 cm
(short absorption length) and λl = 573 cm (long absorption length).

3.3 End-Caps

The ﬁbres are routed to the PMT photocathodes in the two module end-caps (Fig. 12). These
also constitute the mechanical structure by or to which the modules are suspended in the
OPERA detector. The length of the end-cap, 1.7 m, is deﬁned by the module width. Its width
is ﬁxed by the minimum ﬁbre bending radius, the photodetector and its opto–coupling window
and the electronics. Altogether it equals the maximum value of 40 cm, a limit imposed by the
design of the manipulator used for brick insertion into and extraction from the target walls. It
has a maximum thickness of 3.4 cm and weighs about 10 kg. The core of the body is a block of

the sake of shielding the PMT from the spectrometer fringe magnetic ﬁeld.

Fig. 12. 3D view of the central part of an end–cap.

The housing for the free ends of the optical ﬁbres is machined into the foam body. It is lined
with soft black tissue for the sake of protecting the ﬁbre cladding from scratches and increasing
the light tightness. Every other strip is attached to one end-cap, and so on for the other 32.
For this, the end-cap is equipped with 32 rivets of 7.3 mm diameter spaced by 52.8 mm, twice
the maximum scintillator strip width plus 0.1 mm tolerance between strips. Each rivet is due
to receive the hole drilled at one end of a strip. The ﬁbre housing is closed by the optical
coupler providing a precise positioning of each ﬁbre in front of its corresponding PMT channel.
The frame also provides housing for the multi-channel PMT and its HV power supply, the
monitoring light injection system, the front–end electronics and the data acquisition cards. The
low voltage and readout cables are extracted and routed through a path on the back of the end-
caps. When closed with its main cover, the light tightness in the ﬁbre housing is ensured.

The end–caps have been constructed by the A´eriane company 6 .

3.4 Photodetectors

The choice of the photodetector is mainly based on the single p.e detection efﬁciency, the dy-
namic range, the cost and the geometry. Other considerations are gain uniformity among chan-
nels, linearity and cross–talk. The photodetector chosen for the OPERA Target Tracker is based
on the commercially available 64-channel Hamamatsu H7546 PMT. These PMT’s are powered
by a negative polarity high voltage (in the following, the absolute value of the high voltage
will be given). This PMT has also been chosen for the MINOS [6] near detector and has been
extensively evaluated.
Each channel contains two sets of 12 dynodes and covers a surface of 2.3 × 2.3 mm2 (Fig. 13).
The PMT provides a common output of the signals on the last dynodes which can be used as a
FAST-OR to trigger the acquisition system or for timing purposes.

be scanned with a narrow light spot with a diameter < 50 µm. Alternatively, the photocathode

Fig. 15. Gain variation over a single PMT cell
(channel).

Fig. 16. Distribution of the number of p.e col-
lected over a single PMT cell.

Fine scans of the gain distribution and of the number of p.e collected inside a single channel
are shown on Fig. 15 and Fig. 16. They were obtained with a 1.0 mm ﬁbre and a light intensity
reduced to the single p.e level. A loss of p.e collection of the order of 6% is observed when
the ﬁbre is positioned between the two dynodes as is in the experiment. The number of p.e was
computed by ﬁtting the charge distribution with the convolution of a gaussian and a Poisson dis-
tribution for the signal and a gaussian distribution for the pedestal (Fig. 17) [8]. The maximum
dispersion between the two dynodes of the same channel is of the order of 20% while the gain
variation from channel to channel may reach a factor 3 (Fig. 18). The dispersion on the gain is
about 50% of the gain mean value of each channel.

The counting rate induced by natural radioactivity or PMT dark current must be as low as pos-
sible to reduce the effect of dead time. Using the PMT with a threshold corresponding to 1/3
of p.e, a noise of less than 10 Hz/channel at 25oC has been measured coming from photocath-
ode thermo–emission. This possibility of using a low threshold ensures a very high single p.e
detection efﬁciency.

The PMT’s have been customized by Hamamatsu to our requests. Modiﬁcations had to do with
mechanics (assembly and alignment of the tube with the optical coupler), electronics (rearrange-
ment of the back plane connectors) and light tightness (injection of black, high voltage resistant
resin in the space between the tube and its housing).

All PMT’s were connected to a reference optical coupling window and passed a number of
calibration measurements ([9]). These were achieved with a device in which the 64 WLS–ﬁbres
of the coupling window were divided into 8 groups of 8 arranged such that no neighbouring
ﬁbres belong to the same group. Each group of ﬁbres originated in a separate light diffusion box

system from 0.03 to 120 p.e. The signals of two additional monitoring ﬁbres arranged across
each box were read by two reference Hamamatsu HI949 PMT’s. The monitoring of the LED
light output with time was provided by comparison to the light emitted by a piece of scintillator
loaded with a weak 30 Bq Bi source. The testing device is shown in Fig. 19 where the ampliﬁer
box developed especially for this application is seen.

Fig. 19. The multianode PMT testing device.

One of the goals of the PMT tests was to determine the nominal value of the high voltage to be
applied to each unit. The high voltage was deﬁned such that the gain of the strongest channel
of each PMT equals 106. The mean high voltage applied on all tested PMT’s is 825 V varying
from 750 V to 930 V. The gains of the 64 channels are electronically equalized by means of the

front end chips (see 3.5). Along with the gain, other important characteristics were measured,
such as cross–talk and dark current. All relevant results were stored in a data base for use during
the calibration of the Target Tracker modules.

To avoid problems along time, it has been decided not to apply optical grease between the opto–
coupler and the PMT photocathode. Optical grease may also generate bubbles between the PMT
and opto–coupler surface which could create light transmission problems and also increase the
optical cross–talk between channels. This choice causes a loss of about 15% of the number of
observed p.e.

For the high voltage power supply of the PMT’s, small modules located for convenience on the
DAQ boards in the end–caps, have been selected. The modules provided by Iseg company 8
(BPS BPN 10 165 12) fulﬁll the following main requirements:
• Adjustable voltage (negative polarity) between 0 and 1000 V by means of an external control

• Accuracy of the output voltage of 1%, ripple less than 0.01% peak-to-peak and temperature

voltage not exceeding 5 V.

coefﬁcient not exceeding 0.01% ◦C.

• Output maximum current between 1 mA and 2 mA (overload and short circuit protected).
• Modules powered by a low voltage DC supply (14 V±10%).
• MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) higher than 300’000 hours at full load and 25 ◦C (a
burn–in procedure during 24 hours at maximum charge with temperature cycling was done
by the company for each module).

After testing 1032 multi-anode PMT’s, 5.4% have been rejected mainly due to high cross–talk
between neighbouring channels. The cross–talk distributions for direct and diagonal neighbours
are shown in Fig. 20. The mean cross-talk on direct neighbours is of the order of 1.43% while
for diagonal neighbours this factor goes down to 0.65%. Fig. 21 presents the mean gain of all
tested PMT’s versus the channel position. One can see that the channels of the ﬁrst (1–8) and
last (57–64) columns have a signiﬁcantly lower gain than the other channels. PMT’s where the
difference between the highest and lowest observed gain on individual channels exceeds a factor
of 3 were rejected.

Another important parameter, especially for OPERA which is a triggerless experiment, is the
PMT dark count rate. Fig. 22 presents the dark count rate of all tested PMT channels. A mean
value of 2.45 Hz is observed at 20◦C. PMT’s having channels with rate higher than 300 Hz were
rejected.

3.5 Front-End Electronics

The readout electronics of the Target Tracker is based on a 32-channel ASIC, referenced in the
following as the OPERA ReadOut Chip (ROC). Two ROC’s are used to readout each multi–
anode PMT, for a total of 1984 chips for the full detector. A detailed description of the ASIC
design and performance can be found in [10].

The main requirements that have driven the chip design are:
• Compensation for the factor 3 anode-to-anode gain variations (Fig. 18). It is equipped with an
adjustable gain system incorporated in the preampliﬁer stage that delivers a signal of identical
range to the fast and slow shapers of every channel.

• Delivery of a global low noise auto-trigger and time information with 100% trigger efﬁciency
for particles at minimum of ionization (MIP), that is for a signal as low as 1/3 of p.e, corre-
sponding to 50 fC at the anode for a PMT gain of 106.

• Delivery of a charge proportional to the signal delivered by each pixel of the PMT in a

dynamic range corresponding to 1 to 100 p.e.

Each of the 32 channels comprises a low noise variable gain preampliﬁer that feeds both a trig-
ger and a charge measurement arms (Fig. 23). The auto-trigger includes a fast shaper followed
by a comparator. The trigger decision is provided by the logical ”OR” of all 32 comparator
outputs, with a threshold set externally. A mask register allows disabling externally any mal-
functioning channel. The charge measurement arm consists of a slow shaper followed by a
Track & Hold buffer. Upon a trigger decision, charges are stored in 2 pF capacitors and the 32
channels outputs are readout sequentially at a 5 MHz frequency, in a period of 6.4 µs.
The technology of the chip is AMS BiCMOS 0.8 µm 9 Its area is about 10 mm2 and it is
packaged in a QFP100 case. Its consumption depends upon the gain correction settings and

ranges between 130 and 160 mW.

Fig. 23. Architecture of a single channel.

The variable gain system is implemented by adding selectable current mirrors with various areas
(2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.0625). The activation of the six switches thus allows setting an
effective gain correction ranging from 0 to 3.9. By turning off all current switches of a channel,
the gain is zeroed and the channel is disabled. For a correction gain set to 1, the preampliﬁer
gain is found to be 94 mV/pC , or 15 mV/p.e at a PMT gain of 106, with a rise time of about
30 ns . After ampliﬁcation, two copies of the input current are made available to feed both the
trigger and the charge measurement arms. For both arms, the RMS of the noise corresponds to
at most 0.01 p.e.

The fast shaper is directly fed with a mirror output via a 3 pF capacitance and the signal is
integrated in a 0.1 pF charge ampliﬁer. The integration time constant is 10 ns to produce a
fast signal. A differential input is used to minimize offset dispersion and to allow a common
threshold for the chip with a minimal threshold spread. The fast shaper is then followed by
a comparator, whose input stage includes a bipolar differential pair in order to minimize the
offset. With a low offset comparator and a high gain in the shaping just before, a common
threshold can be used for all channels. The trigger decision is deﬁned as the logical “OR” of all
comparator’s outputs and sets in the charge integration process.

Fast shaper characteristics are a gain of 2.5 V/pC, i.e., 400 mV/p.e and a peaking time of 10 ns
for a preampliﬁer gain set to 1. The trigger rise–time only slightly depends on the input charge
magnitude.

The trigger efﬁciency has been measured as a function of the injected charge for each individual
channel. 100% trigger efﬁciency is obtained for input charge as low as 1/10th of p.e, indepen-
dently of the preampliﬁer correction. The trigger threshold common to all channels being set
externally, the output spread among the 32 channels has been carefully controlled. It is found to
be around 0.03 p.e, an order of magnitude smaller than the useful threshold level.
The slow shaper has a long peaking time to minimize the sensitivity to the signal arrival time.
The voltage pulse available on the RC integrator is shaped by a Sallen-Key shaper characterized
by a time constant of 200 ns. This corresponds to an average rise–time of 160 ns with a spread
among the 32 channels not exceeding ±4 ns. In order to minimize pedestal variation from

13

channel-to-channel slow shaper DC offset dispersion, a differential input stage has been used.

Fig. 25. The front–end PCB connected to a
multianode PMT.

Upon a trigger decision, all the capacitors are read sequentially through a shift register made
by D-ﬂip-ﬂop. The pedestal level is 1.2 V in average, with a corresponding spread of ±6 mV.
These numbers correspond to less than 1/3rd of p.e. The signal entering the ADC is in fact the
difference between the multiplexed output and the Channel 0 output. This channel being dis-
connected from any input, this technique allows to make measurements insensitive to pedestal
variations common to all channels caused by, e.g., temperature effects.

The linearity in the charge measurement has been determined for all channels and found to be
better than 2% over the full range 1-16 pC for a preampliﬁer gain of 1, corresponding to 1-100
p.e (Fig. 24).

The noise at the multiplexed output has been measured at 12 fC, i.e., 0.075 p.e for a preampliﬁer
gain 1, and at 3.7 fC or 0.08 p.e for a maximal gain.

Cross–talk due to the ASIC has been carefully considered. Two main sources of cross–talk have
been identiﬁed. A ﬁrst effect is interpreted as a coupling between the trigger and the charge
measurement arms and has been determined to be lower than 0.1%. The second effect affects
the nearest neighbours of a hit channel, where a cross–talk of the order of 1% is measured. This
effect is negligible for far channels where a constant cross–talk component of about 0.2% is
observed.

The front–end board is a 8–layer PCB carrying two ROCs. It is directly plugged to the PMT, as
shown in Fig. 25. The lines from the PMT to the ROC inputs are well separated and protected
from external noise sources by four ground planes in the PCB. The front–end board contains
buffer ampliﬁers for the differential charge output signals of the ROC’s and logic level transla-
tors for the digital signals. It also carries ﬁve operational ampliﬁers, four for adapting the output
voltage range of the two DAC’s on the DAQ board to the threshold voltage range of the two

14

ROC’s and one for reading the high voltage of the PMT. The front–end card is connected to
the DAQ board by means of two 26–lines miniature ﬂat cables. The ADC’s (Analog Devices
AD9220, 12 bits) are located on the DAQ board, in order to minimize the length of the data
bus.

3.6 Light Injection System

The light injection system is used to test and monitor all the electronic channels and the data
acquisition system. In each end–cap, light is injected into the WLS ﬁbres just in front of the
ﬁbre–PMT opto–coupler with the help of LED’s (Kingbright 10 L-7113PBC), straight PMMA
light guides, 6 mm diameter and 50 mm long, and a white painted diffusive box (Fig. 12). The
LED’s are pulsed from outside the end–cap by a purposely designed driver activated by an
external trigger.

The gain monitoring of each PMT channel and its associated electronics can be performed in
a very short time in the single p.e mode and up to about 100 p.e. By pulsing LED’s on one
side of the module and reading the signal on the other side, a possible WLS ﬁbre ageing can be
monitored.

The system is designed to provide a rather uniform illumination, within a factor 3, of all the 64
ﬁbres bundled in a 8 × 8 dense pattern near the optical window.
The light injection system will regularly be operated during the whole experiment duration.

The LED pulser (Fig. 26) provides fast blue light pulses with an amplitude range of more than
a factor of 200, with a stability and reproducibility of about one percent at the high and medium
amplitudes and a few percent at the lowest amplitudes. The circuit, which generates the current
pulses for the pair of LEDs of the light injector, based on standard fast ampliﬁer chips, needs
only ±5 V supplies and ﬁts on a PCB area of 25 × 50 mm2. The pulser requires a LVDS trigger
signal with a width of 20 ns.

The spread of the absolute light output of 2500 LED’s was found to be within a factor of two.
Also the relative light output as a function of the DAC setting can differ up to a factor of two
for two arbitrary chosen LED’s. To improve the uniformity, LED’s of similar performance were
chosen to form a pair and adequate ﬁlters were used to equalize the absolute light yield for
all pulsing systems. The spread of the maximum light signal produced by the LED’s is then
reduced to about ±15% for all injectors and the relative light signals of the LED pairs as a
function of the DAC setting will track within about ±20%.
The variation of the response of one channel as a function of the control voltage applied to the
LED is displayed in Fig. 27. The non linear response below 20 p.e makes the amplitude setting
at the lower end of the range less critical. Signals as low as 0.02 p.e can be extracted from the
background.

4 Radioactivity in the Target Tracker

In this section the radioactivity measurements of the materials used for the Target Tracker con-
struction are presented. The goal of these measurements was mainly to ensure that the back-
ground caused by the activity of these materials was low enough not to introduce signiﬁcant
dead time during the acquisition due to high trigger rate. Using the results of these measure-
ments, a simulation to obtain an estimation of the induced background in the scintillator strips
and measured by the WLS ﬁbres and the PMT’s, has been prepared.
Target Tracker radioactivity has been measured using γ−ray spectrometry with an ultra low
background germanium detector. The “p−type” 400 cm3 Ge semiconductor is well shielded and
located underground at the “La Vue–des–Alpes” laboratory in the Swiss Jura Mountains [11]

16

under 600 m water–equivalent. This detector permits to reach a sensitivity of 10−10 g/g for U
and T h and 10−21 g/g for 60Co.
The radioactivity of the materials selected for the construction of the Target Tracker are sum-
marized in table 1. These materials have been measured during around one week each.

These measurements have been used to estimate the signal induced in a scintillator strip. For
this, all the particles (α, β, γ) coming from the decay chain of the radioactive elements are
simulated for each component. Then the produced particles are propagated in the Target Tracker
geometry and the energy they deposit in the scintillator strip is simulated. Fig. 28 shows the
geometry used for the simulation. 3 scintillator strips have been considered in order to estimate
the signal produced in the middle one.

Fig. 28. Drawing of the geometry used for the simulation.

Table 2 gives an estimation of the rate induced by the radioactivity of each component and the
total rate. The quoted error only reﬂects the uncertainty on the radioactivity measurement. The
main contribution is given by the aluminium cover which produces a total rate of 0.24 Hz. The

17

contributions of the glue and the ﬁbre are negligible. The total background rate per scintillator
strip induced by the radioactivity of all components is estimated to 0.29 ±0.05 Hz, where the
enlarged error includes the uncertainty on the triggering level which could be different in the
experiment than the one used in the simulation.

5 Effect of the magnetic ﬁeld on PMT’s

The efﬁciency of a PMT is affected by a strong enough magnetic ﬁeld because the Lorentz
force modiﬁes the p.e trajectory. Similarly, the gain is reduced by the effect of the ﬁeld on the
multiplication process of the secondary electrons. Studies done by MINOS collaboration and
Hamamatsu indicate that the efﬁciency of the PMT used in OPERA decreases signiﬁcantly if
the magnitude of the ﬁeld perpendicular to the photocathode exceeds 5 Gauss.

Simulations done with TOSCA [13], based on the ﬁnite element method, and AMPERES [14,15],
based on the boundary element method, (Fig. 29), revealed that the magnetic ﬁeld at the place
where PMT’s had to be located was largely exceeding the allowed maximum value. Fig 30
shows the variation of the magnetic ﬁeld along a line parallel to the beam direction and passing
through the series of top PMT’s of row 3 (see Fig. 3 for PMT numbering) where the fringe
ﬁeld was expected to be maximum. The right–hand plot is for the ﬁrst target, upstream of the
ﬁrst spectrometer and the left–hand plot for the second target, between the two spectrometers.
In both cases, the ﬁeld varies between 10 and 40 Gauss, showing the necessity to shield the
PMT’s.

Evaluations of the effects of a magnetic ﬁeld on the performance of the PMT have been per-
formed with a coil surrounding the PMT and its electronics. The efﬁciency, the gain and the

cross–talk between channels have been studied by varying the direction and the magnitude of
the ﬁeld. All 64 photocathode channels were uniformly illuminated with a blue LED. The ratio
Re = Npe(B)/Npe(B = 0) of the number of p.e (Npe) with and without magnetic ﬁeld is used
as a measure of the efﬁciency.

Very different behaviours are observed for channels located on the border and at the centre of the
photocathode (Fig. 31). The border channels are very sensitive to the magnetic ﬁeld while those
at the centre show no signiﬁcant effect below 30 Gauss. Similar results, though less dramatic,
are obtained for the gain dependence to the ﬁeld, evaluated by the ratio RG = G(B)/G(B = 0)

The drop in collection efﬁciency is expected to be associated with an increase in the cross–talk
between channels, a fraction of the electrons being deviated towards the neighbouring channels.
One channel in the centre (#29) and one on the border (#8) have been illuminated in turn, vary-
ing the direction and the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld. The border channels are signiﬁcantly
affected whereas the central ones are not and the effect is maximal when the ﬁeld is orthogonal
to the photocathode (Fig. 33).

prohibitive price. Adequate shielding was obtained with 0.8 mm STE37 or ARMCO (99.5%
Fe, less expensive than Mu-metal) sheets extending over the PMT and the ﬁbres optical window
and using ARMCO instead of aluminium for the bar supporting the ﬁbre–PMT opto–coupler.
STE37 was chosen for the covers for reason of cost. Fig. 34 presents the collection efﬁciency of
one border and one central PMT channel with and without applying the chosen shielding. One
can see that this shielding is very efﬁcient for both channels up to a magnetic ﬁeld of 40 Gauss.

6 Construction and Installation

Two production lines have been set up at IReS–Strasbourg to construct, test and calibrate a total
of 8 modules per week. The construction was done according to the following steps:

(1) Groups of 16 scintillator strips were placed on a frame on a table equipped with a 16–head
glue distribution system. The frame was slightly curved along its length, upward at the
centre. After mixing with the hardener, about 15 g of glue was injected in each groove.
The ﬁbres, stretched with springs at both ends, were positioned inside the grooves. The
frame curvature maintained the ﬁbres at the bottom of the grooves by gravity during glue
polymerization. After polymerization, an aluminized self adhesive Mylar band was laid
over the grooves to increase the light collection.

(2) The two end–caps were placed on the assembly table on reference positions with pins and
holes. A double face adhesive was glued on the bottom aluminium cover sheet. This sheet
was placed on the table, positioning accuracy being achieved by inserting at each end the
32 end–caps rivets in the 32 holes of the covers. To increase light tightness, black glue was
used to assemble the end-caps and the cover together.

(3) The top double face adhesive protection was removed. Thick strings were placed transver-
sally on the adhesive every 40 cm to prevent the contact of the strips with the adhesive

21

before ﬁnal positioning. The 64 strips were positioned in the module. Each strip was ac-
curately positioned at one end, alternatively left and right, by inserting the corresponding
end–cap rivet in its hole. Insuring the proper alignment of the two external strips with
guides provided the overall geometrical accuracy.

(4) All ﬁbres ends were inserted in their nominal holes in the ﬁbre/PMT opto–couplers. This
very delicate manipulation was executed prior to gluing the strips to allow their replace-
ment in case of accidental damaging of the ﬁbres.

(5) The strings were removed and the strips were glued on the double face adhesive. The top
aluminium cover with its double face adhesive was put in place and pressed against the
strips. Again, its holes and the end-caps rivets insured its proper positioning.

(6) The two light injection systems were mounted in the end–caps.
(7) Black glue was injected in the small tank of the opto–couplers. The holes of the opto–
couplers being 0.08 mm larger than the ﬁbre diameter, the glue ﬁlled the holes and slightly
expended to the outside.

(8) The end–caps covers were sealed with black glue. For mechanical protection and to insure
light tightness, an aluminium ribbon reinforced with carbon ﬁbres was glued on the two
long edges of the module. The ribbon was itself further protected by a 0.1 mm U–shape
stainless steel foil.

(9) After polymerization of the glue in the opto–coupler, the module was placed on its side
in a vacuum box. Two elastic membranes applied pressure on the two aluminium cover
sheets to complete the assembly.

(10) The opto–coupler faces were polished with a Diamond Head countersink.
(11) The two PMT’s, their front–end electronic boards, DAQ boards and pairs of LED’s for the

light injection system were mounted in the end-caps and connected.

Using this procedure, only a negligible number of ﬁbres have been broken at one end (< 0.2%)
during the module construction and after the strip gluing.

The modules were transported to Gran Sasso in special boxes of 8 modules, 4 boxes per truck,
equipped with shock absorbers. The 62 Target Tracker walls were mounted in situ in groups of
8, in parallel with the insertion inside the detector of previously mounted walls. The alignment
of the inserted walls was performed using the Leica TDA5005 theodolite. Marks on both end–
caps of the modules were used as reference points.

7 Module tests and calibration

The light tightness of the modules was tested using PMT’s dynode 12 which is the OR of all
the PMT channels. The same measurements repeated in the Gran Sasso underground laboratory
under much reduced cosmic ray and ambient radioactivity background give a counting rate of
the order of 50 Hz/channel in the absence of light leaks.

For energy calibration, each module was placed on a vertical scanning table equipped with two
electron spectrometers (see 3.1) that may irradiate simultaneously any two points of its sur-
face. The nominal high voltage values determined during the PMT acceptance tests previously
described, were applied to the tested module PMT’s. The correction factors equalizing all the
PMT’s channels were set in the front–end chips.

Distance (cm)

Fig. 35. Number of p.e observed at each end of a strip during the calibration of a Target Tracker module
versus the distance from the photodetectors.

Two scanning tables driven by the acquisition program have been used during the production
period. Measurements were taken at 9 points uniformly distributed along the length of each strip
(see example Fig. 36). All distributions of the number of p.e versus the distance have been ﬁtted
by an exponential distribution. The parameters are stored in a data base for further use during
the analysis to reconstruct by calorimetry the energy of OPERA events. Fig. 36 shows the mean
number of p.e observed at the middle of the scintillator strips versus the strips production time.
Fig. 37 is the marginal distribution of the former. The mean number of p.e is 5.9. Essentially,
all values are well above the lower limit of 4 required in the speciﬁcations.

8 Aging

The properties of the glues are well known as they have been used by other neutrino experiments
(NEMO3 [16], MINOS). Several glue samples have been followed for more than 7 years. The
strength of the double face adhesive is guaranteed by the production and selling companies
(MACTAC 11 and VARITAPE 12 ) not to vary for at least 10 years. According to tests done by

11 MACtac Europe, Boulevard Kennedy, B-7060 Soignies, Belgium
12 Varitape, NV Frankrijkstraat, 5 9140 Temse, Belgium

23

the AMCRYS–H company, an acceptable 10% decrease in the light output of the strips is ex-
pected over 10 years. Kuraray ﬁbres are also widely used and tested by high energy experiments
in much more severe conditions than in OPERA, as for example by the LHC ATLAS [17] exper-
iment where no ageing effects have been reported. No ageing is expected for the multi-channel
PMT’s.

During construction, a piece of 100 mm was cut from one every 8th scintillator strip. 63 optically
isolated pieces glued together form a strip of the same length as a regular strip. 64 such strips
made of 7936 pieces were assembled into a module. The module has been placed on a scanning
table and each piece is irradiated in turn by an electron spectrometer following the procedure
developed for the calibration of all Target Tracker modules. Any of the 7936 pieces has its light
output measured every 25 days by continuously running the system, thus allowing a follow–
up of the quality of the scintillator strips and of the glue used for ﬁbres. Natural radioactivity
in the underground laboratory is also being considered to measure the time dependence of the
light output by dedicated measurements considering the shape of the corresponding energy
distribution measured by the Target Tracker.

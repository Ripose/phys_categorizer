We desribe the work arried out at MPIK to design, model, build and hara-

terize a prototype ell (cid:28)lled with a novel indium-loaded sintillator of interest for

real-time low energy solar neutrino spetrosopy. First, light propagation in optial

modules was studied with experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. Subsequently

a 5 m ×

5 m ×

100 m prototype detetor was set-up and the optial performanes

of several samples were measured. We (cid:28)rst tested a benhmark PXE-based sintil-

lator, whih performed an attenuation length of ∼

4.2 m and a photo-eletron yield

730 pe/MeV. Then we measured three In-loaded samples. At an In-loading of

of ∼
44 g/l, an energy resolution of ∼
tained for 477 keV reoil eletrons. The long-range attenuation length in the ell was

11.6 % and a spatial resolution of ∼

7 m were at-

1.3 m and the estimated photo-eletron yield ∼

∼

200 pe/MeV. Light attenuation

and relative light output of all tested samples ould be reprodued reasonably well

by MC. All optial properties of this system have remained stable over a period of

> 1 y.

Introdution

The use of indium as a target for the real-time spetrosopy of low energy solar

νe (pp,

7

Be, CNO) has been thoroughly investigated in the past [1,2,3,4℄ and

reproposed in reent years [5,6℄. In the period 2001-2004 the feasibility study

of an In-based solar neutrino detetor has been the fous of the LENS pro jet

[7℄. The results presented here have been arried out within the framework of

this pilot phase.

The νe detetion would proeed via an inverse-EC reation on

the position of the event along the ell longitudinal axis. There is no handle

for the reonstrution of the transversal oordinates, therefore the ell ross-

setion must be hosen su(cid:30)iently small to ontrol the bakground. The length

is upper-limited by light attenuation in the module. The range onsidered for

the ell dimensions is 5

10 m side, & 1 m length.

In order to test thoroughly the detetor onept, a pilot experiment [8℄ has

been set-up at the LENS Low Bakground Faility (LLBF) [9℄, at the Gran

Sasso underground laboratory. The pilot detetor onsists of a 3

3 matrix

×

of 5 m ×

5 m ×

100 m sintillator ells. Four of the 9 ells are (cid:28)lled with

In-loaded liquid sintillators developed by us [10,11,12℄ and another group of

the LENS ollaboration [13℄.

In this paper we desribe the preparation, modeling, optimization and (cid:28)nal

optial haraterization of a prototype ell of an In-based solar neutrino de-

tetor. In Se. 2 we report on experimental studies on the light (cid:16)piping(cid:17) in the

ell. Se. 3 desribes our In-loaded liquid sintillator, with fous on its optial

properties. Se. 4 is devoted to the modeling of optis in the ell, and the re-

sults of preparatory Monte Carlo studies are presented. In Se. 5 we desribe

the prototype setup and measurement ampaigns. The results, inluding the

ruial test of the long-term (> 1 y ) stability of this system, are presented in

Se. 6. In Se. 7 we give our onlusions and outlook.

2 Measurements of light piping

The bakground suppression in an indium solar neutrino experiment requires

the unitary ell to have a small ross-setion (∼

−

5

10 m side). To limit the

3

hardware osts, the unitary ell needs to be as long as possible. In suh a

geometry (Fig. 1), photons undergo many re(cid:29)etions before hitting the PMTs

and even a small ine(cid:30)ieny an result in large light losses. These an de-

grade the detetor energy and spatial resolution, whih are the fundamental

parameters toward bakground redution.

Denoting R as the surfae re(cid:29)etane, we have estimated that with R . 98 %

the original light intensity would drop to less than 1/2 at ∼

2 m distane,

thus preventing the onstrution of su(cid:30)iently long ells (i.e., of an a(cid:27)ordable

detetor). For the validation of the detetion onept it was neessary to hek

whih level of piping e(cid:30)ieny an be met by using available tehnology.

We have experimentally investigated the re(cid:29)etion oe(cid:30)ients of two suitable

piping mehanisms: total internal re(cid:29)etion (TIR) in a quartz prototype ell;

speular re(cid:29)etane (SR) in a pipe lined with a re(cid:29)etive foil. Quartz is the

material hosen for the ells of the (cid:28)nal LENS pilot detetor, due to its low

ativity and hemial ompatibility with organi solvents.

2.1 Total internal re(cid:29)etion

Total internal re(cid:29)etion from an optially denser to a less dense medium pro-

vides in priniple a 100 % e(cid:30)ient piping for all impinging angles larger than

θc = arcsin(no/ni), where ni,o are the refrative indies of the inner and outer

media. However, beause of surfae imperfetions the real re(cid:29)etane is lower.

We have used a prototype quartz pipe to estimate the e(cid:27)etive TIR re(cid:29)etane

in a sintillation module. The pipe is ≃

110 m long, its setion is square

with rounded orners, with ≃

15 mm external dimension and ≃

2 mm quartz

4

thikness. Materials and surfae (cid:28)nishing are similar to those of the (cid:28)nal LENS

prototype ells (to desribe in Se. 5).

A drawing of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2. The quartz tube

is oupled to a PMT on one side and open on the other side for (cid:28)lling and

insertion of a light (cid:28)ber, whih is onneted to a 430 nm LED

2

. The latter

an be externally triggered to emit light in form of fast pulses. At the free

side of the (cid:28)ber a Te(cid:29)on ap di(cid:27)uses the LED light. The ell was (cid:28)lled with

liquids to simulate a sintillator-like refrative medium. We have used (cid:16)Uvasol(cid:17)

ylohexane (n ≃

1.42), (cid:16)Uvasol(cid:17) ethanol (n ≃

1.37) and (cid:16)99+%(cid:17) dodeane

1.42), all showing exellent transpareny in the UV-visible range. The

(n ≃

light (cid:28)ber an be deployed at various distanes from the PMT and we measured

the light intensity as a funtion of the distane.

Fig. 3 shows the results of the measurements and the urves we predit for

three values of the TIR re(cid:29)etane. The preditions are given by a photon-

traing MC simulation.

We observe that the two measurements using di(cid:27)erent (cid:28)lling liquids are on-

sistent with eah other. The data analysis is based on the omparison with

the MC preditions (details in [15℄). The result is:

The unertainty (1σ) inludes the statistial error (∼

0.05 %), and the sys-

temati errors due to the approximations in the MC (∼

unertainty of the attenuation length of quartz and liquids (∼

0.15 %) and to the

0.10 %).

The results of similar measurements arried out at 380 nm are reported in [15℄

2.2 Speular re(cid:29)etion by VM2000 foil

TIR is a very e(cid:30)ient piping mehanism, however has the disadvantage that

a large fration of the solid angle is not overed (∼

50 %, for n = 1.5 in the

liquid). SR an be nearly equally e(cid:30)ient at all angles, however the re(cid:29)etane

of onventional metal-oated mirrors is limited.

3M has reently issued the VM2000, a multi-layer re(cid:29)etive foil based on a

novel tehnology [16℄. We have measured the absolute re(cid:29)etane of di(cid:27)erent

samples of VM2000 using the V-W aessory of our Varian Cary 400 spe-

trophotometer.

Fig. 4 shows the result of a sample from a bath shipped by 3M in 2002

3

and, for omparison, the re(cid:29)etane of a onventional Al-oated mirror. We

found that this foil has R & 97 % for λ

400 nm (R ∼

≥

98 % at 430 nm).

1 %) is too large with

However, the systemati error of the measurement (∼

respet to the dependene of the response of an indium ell on R. Moreover,

our equipment probes only one angle of inidene (θ = 7◦).

For these reasons, the system used to investigate TIR has been adapted for

the measurement of a SR-based ell: a long square pro(cid:28)le of VM2000 was

inserted into the quartz tube, so that the quartz internal surfae was lined

with re(cid:29)etive foils (Fig. 2). Data were taken with the pipe (cid:28)lled with air and

liquids to test whether the optis of the foil is a(cid:27)eted by the refrative index

of the oupled medium, and to ross hek systematis due to the absorption

in the liquid. Data were analyzed by omparing with MC, and the result at

Older foils had signi(cid:28)antly di(cid:27)erent spetra and an overall worse performane,

tainty, the systematis deriving from the unertainty in the shape and dimen-

sions of the pipe, and as well the systematis assoiated with the MC-based

analysis proedure. The result 2 is onsistent with the V-W measurement

at near-normal inidene, however it is more preise and gives a re(cid:29)etane

averaged over the foil surfae and all angles of inidene.

2.3 Impliations

Given the results of Eqs. 1 - 2, the design optimizing light piping in an indium

solar neutrino experiment is a TIR-based ell externally wrapped with non-

oupled VM2000 foil.

We have used the measured re(cid:29)etion oe(cid:30)ients to study the optis of a

ell via MC simulations. The results, published in [15℄, indiate that with the

aforementioned TIR/SR design, piping ine(cid:30)ieny would not be limiting as

far as the attenuation length due to absorption in the sintillator is . 10 m.

This result was ruial to advane the LENS pro jet in the pilot phase.

In-loaded sintillator

One approah initially explored in LENS for the prodution of In-loaded sin-

tillators was to dissolve In as a arboxylate ompound InA3 [6℄. However, it

7

turned out that indium has a muh higher hemial reativity to OH− than to

the arboxyli aids: In

begins to reat with water to form hydroxy speies

3+

even at pH 1 [14℄.

Hydrolysis is a severe problem toward the synthesis of a stable and robust

In-loaded sintillator. The idea pursued at MPIK was to enapsulate the In

atom in a stable moleule that preserves its identity in the organi solution.

This was aomplished by using β -diketones as ligand [10℄.

Several In β -diketonates have been synthesized and studied. The β -diketone

(cid:28)nally hosen for the LENS prototype is the simplest one, aetylaetone (Ha-

a), and the In omplex is in the form In(aa)3 . The latter is produed as a

white rystalline powder, puri(cid:28)ed by sublimation and (cid:28)nally dissolved in the

sintillator base. We found the solubility of In(aa)3 in most of the standard

organi sintillator solvents (inluding PC and PXE) not to be su(cid:30)ient for

the demands of a neutrino detetor. However, anisol ensures a higher solubility,

with a limit In-loading of 7.9 % by weight [10℄.

3.1 Light yield

The In(aa)3 moleule has an absorption band that overlaps with the UV

emission of anisol [11℄. In(aa)3 gives no detetable (cid:29)uoresene when exited

at its absorption band [11℄, hene this moleule dissipates a part of the solvent

exitation that would otherwise onvert into sintillation light. The strategy

to obtain good light yields (LY) is to enhane the [anisol → (cid:29)uor℄ pathway

relative to the quenhing [anisol → In(aa)3 ℄ dissipation. The onentration

of In(aa)3 is onstrained by the demand of high In-loading, therefore the

8

only handle for ontrolling the energy transfer is the hoie of the (cid:29)uor and

its onentration. We found that the best results are given by BPO [2-(4-bi-

phenyl)-5-phenyloxazole℄ [12,18℄ and we observed that at high In-loading, the

LY in a small sample inreases monotonially with the BPO onentration,

up to its solubility limit. The dependene of the LY on the (cid:29)uor onentration

is well explained by theoretial models of energy transfer and light quenhing

[12,18℄. Fig. 5 shows the LY versus the BPO onentration in two In-aa

sintillator samples di(cid:27)ering by In-loading. At the benhmark In-loading of

50 g/l, notable light yields are only obtained with (cid:29)uor onentrations that

are (cid:16)unusual(cid:17) in standard organi sintillators, as regards the use in large

sale detetors.

We also use bis-MSB [1,4-bis(2methyl-styryl)benzene℄. The primary LY in

BPO systems is nearly independent of its onentration [12,18℄, however bis-

MSB shifts the sintillation light in a wavelength region of higher transpareny.

Fig. 6 shows the emission spetra of the two (cid:29)uoresing moleular systems

dissolved in our sintillator.

3.2 Light attenuation

For appliation in a solar neutrino detetor, the sintillator formulation has to

maximize the photo-eletron yield (PY) in a ell. In this ase, light attenuation

in the detetor plays an important role.

We have measured by spetrophotometry the extintion oe(cid:30)ients of eah

sintillator omponent, as desribed in [10,11,18℄. This information is om-

bined with the onentration to alulate the partial attenuation length, µi(λ),

9

due to the ith

solute. In our mixture the attenuation proesses due to eah om-

ponent are independent of eah other, hene the resulting global attenuation

length µ is alulated as:

1

−

1
µi !

µ =

 

Xi

(3)

As an example, the partial µi and the total µ for the system [anisol / In(aa)3

(In 50 g/l) / BPO (50 g/l) / bis-MSB (100 mg/l)℄ are plotted in Fig. 7. At the

referene wavelength of 430 nm, the dominating ontribution is due to BPO

1.5 m). Fluorimetri measurements have shown that BPO absorption for

(

∼

greater wavelengths than ∼
4

results only in a light loss

anisol and bis-MSB both ∼
430 nm is µ

∼

410 nm is not followed by re-emission and hene

[12,18℄. The puri(cid:28)ed In(aa)3 ontributes ∼
10 m. The resulting total attenuation length at

3 m,

The onlusion is that reasonable detetor performanes an be obtained either

with a more In-diluted sintillator (so that less (cid:29)uor is needed), or with shorter

ells than initially envisaged. The deision for the LENS pilot phase was the

latter and hene the dimensions of the prototype ells were (cid:28)xed to 5 m ×
100 m. The fous has then shifted to (cid:28)nd the parameter area where
5 m ×

the best ompromise between primary LY and e(cid:30)ient light transport over

1 m distane is realized. This was aomplished by MC simulations.

4 Model of an In-loaded sintillator ell

We have developed an optial model of the detetor implementing a detailed

physial desription of those features that we identi(cid:28)ed as ruial. This model

has been used to write a photon-traing MC of an In-loaded sintillator ell.

The MC implements a geometry that faithfully reprodues the atual In proto-

type ell, to be desribed later (shown in Fig. 10). The sintillator formulation

is based on the aforementioned anisol/In(aa)3/BPO/bis-MSB mixture. We

made the assumption that light is emitted aording to the (cid:29)uoresene spe-

trum of the last non-radiatively exited omponent. We have determined the

nature of the donor-aeptor energy transfer as disussed in [11,18℄. We found

that, for our onentration levels, the transfer anisol → BPO is non-radiative,

while BPO → bis-MSB is predominantly radiative. As a onsequene, we as-

sume the BPO emission spetrum as the primary (cid:29)uoresene (Fig. 6).

The basi interations of optial photons in a medium are absorption, elasti

sattering and inelasti sattering. In the latter ase the photon is absorbed

by a (cid:29)uoresing moleule, whih de-exites emitting a photon of longer wave-

length. In our systems di(cid:27)erent hemial speies are present and eah one

ontributes to some or all of the above proesses. At the spetrophotometer,

absorption, elasti and inelasti sattering are indistinguishable, as they all re-

sult in removing photons from a ollimated beam. Therefore, it is neessary to

evaluate independently their relative probabilities. We have negleted elasti

sattering, sine it is sub-dominant in most ases. Consequently, the measured

extintion is onsidered as the sum of absorption and inelasti sattering. A

(cid:29)uoresene quantum yield, φ, an be de(cid:28)ned as the probability that an ab-

11

sorption is followed by a prompt re-emission. In Table 1 the values of φ used

in our model are reported. We assume φ = 0 % for anisol at all wavelengths

beause its emission spetrum has no overlap with the emission of BPO [11℄.

BPO is expeted to have very high quantum yield, as the literature value for

the similar PPO is φ

100 % [19℄. However, we hose a more onservative

≃

90 %, with ut-o(cid:27) at 410 nm (see Se. 3.2). For bis-MSB we use the literature

φ [19℄ and our (cid:29)uorimetri measurements for the ut-o(cid:27) [18℄. In(aa)3 and

quartz do not show (cid:29)uoresene in the visible, hene φ = 0.

In our MC simulation all omponents interat with light independently of eah

other. The respetive attenuation lengths are alulated from the onentra-

tions and extintion oe(cid:30)ients, as in Fig. 7. The parameters in Table 1 are

used to deide whether an interation is an absorption or a wavelength shift.

Light piping in the ell is simulated via TIR and SR using Eqs. 1 and 2. We

(cid:28)x the refrative index of sintillator, quartz and PMT window to 1.5. The

PMTs are oupled to the ell ends with π/4 surfae overage (a disk insribed

in a square). For their sensitivity, the typial (cid:16)green-enhaned(cid:17) bialkali QE is

hosen, and the values are downsaled of a fator 0.75 to take into aount

the redued sensitive area and the olletion e(cid:30)ieny. Light interation with

the PMTs is modeled as in [20℄.

The output of the MC is the photo-detetion probability, whih an be on-

verted in absolute units by folding with the sintillator LY.

4.1 Sintil lator optimization

One ruial question addressed by MC simulation is the determination of the

optimal BPO onentration, for the given 50 g/l In-loading. For this analysis

the bis-MSB onentration was (cid:28)xed to 100 mg/l, and BPO was varied.

Taking as referene parameter the light output for a soure at the ell enter,

Fig. 8 illustrates the ompetition between LY and light transport. The best

ompromise is expeted at ∼

50 g/l BPO, whih gives LY ∼

42 % relative to

5

BC505

.

In a similar way, the e(cid:27)et of the variation of the bis-MSB onentration was

studied via MC simulation. The results are shown in Fig. 9, for a (cid:28)xed BPO

onentration of 50 g/l and soure at the ell enter. The MC preditions are

strongly model-dependent and the optimal bis-MSB onentration shifts to

higher values along with the ut-o(cid:27) for re-emission and with φ. Using the

best values from the literature and our measurements (Table 1), the optimal

onentration is expeted in the few 102

mg/l to 1 g/l range, and should yield

6

8 % relative inrease of the light output with respet to the ase of no

a ∼

−

bis-MSB. The bis-MSB onentration is therefore predited to be a non-ritial

parameter. This is due to the fat that the BPO emission is already peaked at

long wavelengths (Fig. 6) and that BPO an itself at as a wavelength shifter

(WLS) in the range λ . 410 nm.

The BICRON spei(cid:28)ation for BC505 is 80 % of Anthraene. The BC505 mea-

5 Prototype set-up and measurement ampaigns

The prototype ell reported here is one of a set of 12 idential quartz mod-

ules built by MPIK for the LENS pilot experiment [8℄. The raw pro(cid:28)le tubes

have been manufatured by the Heraeus Quartz Glas GmbH out of (cid:16)syntheti

quartz rystals(cid:17). Helma GmbH has welded the two side windows and manu-

fatured two openings and stoppers for liquid (cid:28)lling/removal. The ells have

been (cid:28)nally annealed at Heraeus.

The ell dimensions are 5 m×
ing at the orners (4 mm radius of urvature) and the wall thikness is 2 mm.

100 m, the setion is square with round-

5 m×

A 5 mm air gap is left on top of the sintillator to avoid that this touhes the

stoppers of the (cid:28)lling openings.

5.1 Experimental tehnique

A system has been set up to measure the optial performanes of the prototype

ell, inluding light attenuation, energy and spatial resolution, PY. In order

to test the detetor response to the deposition of single known energies, the

Compton-bak-sattering (CBS) tehnique was implemented.

Fig. 10 shows a drawing of the experimental set-up. The ell is irradiated with

a ollimated γ soure and the light pulses resulting from the energy deposited

by the sattered eletrons are measured in oinidene on both PMTs. An

additional liquid sintillation unit is loated on the bak side of soure and

ollimator, opposite to the ell. A three-fold oinidene an be set, whih

selets the events with simultaneous energy deposition in the ell and in the

14

bak-sattering box.

The logi sheme of the eletronis is shown in Fig. 11. The PMTs used are the

ETL9954B. Their analogial signals are doubled; one opy is disriminated and

then used to form the trigger ondition and the logi stop signals for a Time-

to-Digital-Converter (TDC); the other opy is delayed of the time required for

the system to trigger and then sent to an integrating harge-sensitive Analog-

to-Digital-Converter (ADC).

In order to improve the S/B ratio of the CBS measurement, we apply event-by-

event uts. A large part of the bakgrounds is removed by requiring that the

energy in the oinidene box is E

ECBS and that the TDC spatial

Eγ −

≤

reonstrution of the event is onsistent with the position of the irradiated

volume.

Two γ soures have been utilized:

137

54

Cs and

Mn, whih deliver CBS reoil

eletrons of 477 keV and 639 keV, respetively. These two energies are partiu-

larly signi(cid:28)ant for an In detetor: the former is lose to the energy of the se-

ond γ of the ν -tag (498 keV) and is representative of the hard-Bremsstrahlung

bakground [7℄. The CBS of the

Mn soure has an energy similar to the total

54

energy released by the ν -tag (613 keV). With these two soures it is possible

to test diretly how well the ν -tag an be resolved from bakground events

in the range of the

115

In β end-point energy. This is one of the most ruial

issues for the feasibility of an indium solar neutrino experiment [7℄.

5.2 Measurements

We have measured 4 sintillator samples, whose harateristis are reported

in Table 2. We will refer to them using the same nomenlature in the table.

After eah ell (cid:28)lling the sintillator has been (cid:29)ushed with nitrogen for about

one hour to sweep oxygen, whih an derease the LY and lead to hemial

degradation.

5.2.1 Benhmark PXE el l

The PXE-based sintillator serves to study the detetor performane in a

benhmark ase. The PXE omes from a bath used by Borexino in the CTF

[21℄. We measured the LY to be (83

4)% relative to BC505. The sample

±

has been puri(cid:28)ed by us using a solid (neutral pH silia-gel) olumn plant as

reported in [21℄. The resulting attenuation lengths at various wavelengths are

given in the (cid:28)rst row of Table 3. In the range of the emission peak µ

1 m,

≫

therefore the measurement of this sample tests the optial integrity of the

quartz ell and ross-heks the re(cid:29)etion oe(cid:30)ients given in Se. 2, through

omparison with the MC. Furthermore, assuming that no highly In-loaded

sintillator would ever perform better than this sample, the PXE performanes

provide an upper limit for those of an In-ell in the onsidered design.

5.2.2 In-loaded el ls

We have synthesized and puri(cid:28)ed several hundreds grams of In(aa)3 rystals

for use in these optial measurements and for loading in the (cid:28)nal LENS pilot

detetor at Gran Sasso. The three sintillator samples In-l, In-h1 and In-h2

16

have been prepared by subsequent additions of omponents to a ommon base.

The measurement of the In-l sample aims at studying the ell performane in

the lowest In-loading range that is onsidered of interest for a solar neutrino

detetor. The samples In-h1 and In-h2 have In-loading in the range targeted

by LENS and are the base ase for the pilot phase. Their BPO onentration

was hosen based on the results of the MC studies presented in Se. 4.1 and

they only di(cid:27)er by the bis-MSB onentration. Table 3 reports the attenuation

lengths of the three samples at various wavelengths.

6 Results

6.1 Benhmark PXE el l

Two sets of measurements have been performed:

(1) TIR light piping

(2) TIR plus VM2000 light piping

For the measurements 1 light was piped via TIR at the quartz/air and sintil-

lator/air boundaries. For the seond ampaign a non-oupled VM2000 pro(cid:28)le

has been wrapped around the ell.

6.1.1 Light attenuation

With the TIR ell the light attenuation urve has been measured by san-

ning the detetor response to a 380 nm ollimated LED. The LED exites the

sintillator (cid:29)uors, whih re-emit light isotropially. The resulting light atten-

uation urves are shown in Fig. 12. For omparison, the graphis also reports

17

the data-points obtained with the CBS peak of the

Cs soure (measurement

137

to be desribed later). The predition of the MC simulation of the system is

also shown in the (cid:28)gure.

No signi(cid:28)ant di(cid:27)erenes are observed in the attenuation urves measured

by the two PMTs, as expeted, and the CBS data are onsistent with the

LED measurement. A small departure between simulation and experiment is

observed at short distanes, where the simulation predits a slightly faster

attenuation

. However, in the rest of the urve MC and data are in good

6

agreement.

For the ell wrapped with re(cid:29)etive foil, the light attenuation urve ould not

be measured with the external LED, sine the transpareny of the VM2000

is very poor. The ell has been irradiated with the ollimated

Cs soure

137

and the system operated in simple two-fold oinidene mode, to selet all

Compton interations in the ell. The position of the Compton-edge was used

to estimate the relative light intensity. The resulting attenuation urves are

shown in Fig. 13.

The measurements of the two PMTs are in slight disagreement in the initial

part of the urves, probably due to a slow drift of the gain of one PMT. There

is however good agreement for d > 40 m.

The preditions of two MC simulations are also reported in the (cid:28)gure. Two

limit ases are shown, whih are de(cid:28)ned (cid:16)TIR or SR(cid:17) and (cid:16)TIR and SR(cid:17). In

the former, light re(cid:29)ets either via TIR or SR, depending whether θ > θc

6

Sine we ompare the attenuation urves with eah other upon normalization at

the ell enter, the fat that the simulation stays above the data at short distane

simply means that light is expeted to be attenuated faster in this range.

18

or θ < θc . (cid:16)TIR and SR(cid:17) assumes that all the light lost by TIR at θ > θc

has the opportunity to be re(cid:29)eted by the foils. This results in an e(cid:27)etive

99.99 % for θ > θc . Light di(cid:27)usion at the interfaes is not onsidered.

R ∼

We (cid:28)tted the attenuation urves with a double exponential funtion:

f = Ise−

(x

x0)/µs + Ile−

−

(x

−

x0)/µl

(4)

where x0 is the distane of the losest data point (here x0 = 5 m). The

(cid:28)t returns two e(cid:27)etive attenuation lengths (µs and µl ), the weights at the

referene distane x0 (Is and Il ) and the unertainties for those parameters.

The ratio Ws,l = Is,l/(Is+Il) gives the fration of the intensity measured by the

PMT at x0 that is attenuated with a µs,l attenuation length. Most important

for this study is the longer attenuation omponent, µl , whih haraterizes

light attenuation at a distane from the PMT where geometrial e(cid:27)ets and

short-range light-loss mehanisms have deayed out.

The analysis of the experimental and simulated urves of Figs. 12 and 13

is given in Table 4. In the ase of TIR piping, about (85

90)% of the light

−

deteted from 5 m distane propagates in the ell with an e(cid:27)etive attenuation

length of ∼

3 m. The simulation predits similar parameters. This means that

the physis of light propagation in the ell is well understood and no light loss

mehanisms beside the known ones are present.

For the ell wrapped with VM2000 foil µl = (4.2

0.3) m with weight ∼

±

91 %,

signi(cid:28)antly better than the performane of TIR alone. This result disfavors

the (cid:16)TIR or SR(cid:17) senario: for this ase, the e(cid:27)etive attenuation length should

not improve, as the VM2000 would simply pipe light outside the TIR aep-

tane, however with a lower e(cid:30)ieny than TIR (f. Eqs. 1 and 2).

19

The longitudinal san of the ell response allows alibrating the TDC. The

hannel-to-position sale is linear with good approximation. From the width

of the TDC distributions we dedue that a single LED event originating ∼

103

photo-eletrons (estimated from the width of the ADC distribution) an be

reonstruted with a spatial resolution of ∼

2 m (1σ).

6.1.2 CBS measurements

The ADC and TDC spetra of a

Cs CBS run for the ell wrapped with

137

VM2000 are shown in Fig. 14. The energy spetrum after uts shows a nearly

Gaussian CBS peak, with a modest bakground ontamination on the left side

of the peak. The latter is su(cid:30)iently small to allow a preise determination

of the energy resolution by (cid:28)tting with a Gaussian plus an asymmetri bak-

ground. The TDC spetrum obtained by seleting only the events in the CBS

energy window has a prominent Gaussian peak orresponding to the soure

position.

The results of the analysis of ADC and TDC CBS data for both measure-

ments of the PXE sample are reported in Table 5. At 477 keV, the 1σ energy

resolution is (8.8

0.2)% for TIR piping, (5.4

0.2)% for mixed TIR/SR pip-

±

ing, nearly onstant over the ell length. At the same energy, the 1σ spatial

resolution is (4.4

0.2) m and (3.2

0.2) m for the TIR and TIR/SR ells,

±

±

respetively, soure at enter; it gets slightly worse at the ell ends.

6.1.3 Photo-eletron yield

We will onsider (cid:28)rst the measurement of the TIR ell. The detetor energy

resolution gives an indiation of the PY. If it is assumed that the width of

±

20

the CBS peak is dominated by the statistial (cid:29)utuations in the average total

number of pe,

¯Ns , we (cid:28)nd

¯Ns = 123

5 at 477 keV, soure at enter. This

±

would translate to PY = (260

10) pe /MeV. Repeating the alulation for

eah PMT leads to

±
2 and

¯Nl = 57

±

¯Nr = 71

2.

±

However, the energy resolution is not expeted to be purely statistial. In

order to estimate independently the PY, we have alibrated the system by

measuring the response to a spe. For this alibration the LED has been used.

The light intensity was tuned to a sub-Poisson regime (pe/pulse ≪

1), so

that the probability to measure events with more than one pe is negligible.

The trigger was synhronized with the external LED trigger signal and a

50(1

0.03) ampli(cid:28)ation stage was introdued.

×

±

The result of the alibration is: Nl = 58

9 and Nr = 73

3. The alibration

±

±

of the (cid:16)right(cid:17) PMT is more preise due to a better peak/valley ratio of the spe

response.

The estimation of the number of pe based on this alibration is onsistent with

the energy resolution. Therefore we onlude that in this regime the detetor

resolution is dominated by the statistial (cid:29)utuations of the number of pe.

For the TIR/SR ell, the energy resolutions of the

Cs and

Mn CBS lines

137

54

orrespond to a limit PY = (720

25) pe/MeV and PY = (740

respetively. The spe alibration gives an average of (171

30) pe/MeV,

±
7) pe/PMT at

±

477 keV, translating to PY=(715

30) pe/MeV. Therefore energy resolution

±

±

and spe alibration are also in this ase in agreement with eah other.

Table 6 summarizes the analysis of the PY based on the CBS measurements

and the spe alibration. The results of the MC are also reported. The MC

21

predits more than twie as muh light as measured. This disrepany must

be understood, sine the feasibility of an In experiment depends dramatially

on the detetor energy resolution. This question will be addressed again in

Se. 6.3.

We observe that the use of the VM2000 foil improves the light olletion of

more than a fator 2. This shows that the foil serves not only to pipe the light

outside the TIR aeptane, but also ompensates the non ideal geometry of

the quartz ell (rounded orners) and other (cid:16)TIR leakages(cid:17). This e(cid:27)et is well

desribed by our model: the MC predits PY

depending on the assumed senario. The experimental value is ∼

TIR/SR

/PY

2.3

2.5,

TIR ∼

−

2.4.

6.2 Indium-loaded el ls

The measurements with PXE have shown that the prototype ell works prop-

erly and that the VM2000 wrapping inreases the PY of a fator of ∼

2.5.

Consequently this design was also hosen for the indium measurements.

6.2.1 Light attenuation

Due to the lower energy resolution, the Compton edge smears into a shoulder

and no lear peak is observed. For this reason, we preferred to perform the

san of the ell with CBS measurements.

The results for the In-h1 and In-h2 samples are shown in Fig. 15 together

with the MC-predited light attenuation urve. No signi(cid:28)ant di(cid:27)erenes are

observed in the attenuation of the two samples. The simulation reprodues

very well the long-range behavior of the experimental urves, whereas it pre-

22

dits a slightly faster light attenuation at d . 30 m. This means that this

detetor performs better than expeted at short distane, and as expeted at

long distane.

The results of the (cid:28)t of experimental and simulated urves for all In samples

are given in Table 7. The high-loading samples give µl ≃

1.3 m for 75

80 % of

−

the light. The experimental (cid:28)nding that they exhibit very similar attenuation

is also predited by the MC. The longer µl of the simulations is misleading: it

simply results from the smaller weight of the long-range omponent (µl and

Wl anti-orrelate in the (cid:28)t). The In-l sample has a slightly better performane,

as expeted.

6.2.2 CBS measurements

the errors.

6.2.3 Photo-eletron yield

Fig. 16 shows the ADC and TDC spetra of a high statistis CBS run with the

In-h2 sample.The analysis of the CBS runs is reported in Table 8. At 44 g/l

In-loading, σE = (11.6

0.2)% and σx = (7.0

0.4) m at 477 keV, soure at

±

±

enter. The results of In-h1 and In-h2 are ompatible with eah other within

The estimations of the PY are given in Table 9 The values derived from the

spe alibrations are in this ase signi(cid:28)antly higher than those based on the

energy resolution, probably beause for a low number of pe the departure of

the energy resolution from the

√N statistial limit is more important. The

light at the ell enter is for all In-loaded samples less than 1/3 of PXE. The

di(cid:27)erene of LY gives a fator ∼

1/2 and the lower transpareny explains the

1

23

rest. In fat, the MC predits a similar ratio as observed.

6.2.4 Long-term stability

We have re-measured the optial properties of the prototype ell ∼

14 months

after the (cid:28)rst ampaign (sample In-h2). During this time the ell has been

stored in darkness, at room temperature (no temperature ontrol) and ex-

posed to air (sealed in nitrogen atmosphere, however the air-tightness of the

module was not tested). The results of light attenuation, energy resolution

and PY are presented in Table 10. The results are overall onsistent with

our (cid:28)rst determination (Tables 7, 8 and 9). The large error of the long-range

attenuation length is due to the fat that less points have been probed, how-

ever for all measured positions the ratio I(x)/I(50 cm) is well onsistent with

the results of Fig. 15. The energy resolutions of the single PMTs and the spe

alibration indiate a slightly higher light output, whih we however onsider

not signi(cid:28)ant, taking into aount the systemati unertainties related to the

re-building of the eletronis and the new optial oupling of the PMTs (not

inluded in the quoted errors). We onlude that neither the transpareny, nor

the LY of the sintillator have degraded during a period of > 1 y.

6.3 Summary and disussion

The measurements of PY and light attenuation are brought together in Fig.

17, whih shows the absolute detetor performane as a funtion of the soure

position for the In-h2 sample (whih has a similar omposition as the sample

we (cid:28)lled in the Gran Sasso pilot detetor).

In Fig. 18 the CBS spetra of two runs of similar statistis are superimposed,

one with the

Cs soure, the other with

Mn (In-h1 sample). The (cid:28)gure

137

54

gives an idea of how well the MPIK LENS prototype would energetially re-

solve an event in the upper range of the

115

In β -bakground (E . 500 keV)

from the delayed ν -tag (E= 613 keV). The resolution of these two events is

the ruial parameter for the feasibility of an In solar neutrino experiment.

With the results presented in this paper, at 44 g/l In-loading those two en-

1.5 σ apart, where σ is given by the sum in quadrature of the

ergies are ∼
standard deviation of the single lines. For example, if a ut is set at the ν -tag

energy minus 1σ , the probability that a bakground event with E ∼

480 keV

survives the ut, onsidering only the deposited energy, is ∼

10 %. A detailed

Monte Carlo analysis of the signal to noise ratio has been arried out within

the LENS ollaboration [23℄. It has shown that the suppression of the In β -

Bremsstrahlung bakground to an adequate level requires an energy resolution

at ∼

480 keV of a fator of ∼

30 % better than that reported here.

In Fig. 19 all the measurements of spatial resolution have been displayed as a

funtion of the number of pe. The spatial resolution an be parametrized by

a funtion σx ∼
(cid:28)t gives k

∼

k
√Npe

, where Npe is the number of pe and k a onstant. The

65.6. The satter of the data with respet to the (cid:28)t funtion is

large, however the parametrization gives a useful (cid:16)rule of thumb(cid:17) to predit

the detetor spatial resolution for a wide range of ases with better than 20 %

preision.

The last olumn of Tables 6 and 9 reminds us that more than a fator 2 of

light is missing aording to the MC preditions. The fat that the simulations

reprodue reasonably well the experimental light attenuation urves demon-

strates that the disrepany in the PY is not related to light losses (cid:16)on the

25

way(cid:17) to the PMTs. This is supported by the observation that the experimental

de(cid:28)it relative to the MC is roughly onstant. It is possible that the 2′′ PMTs

utilized have an e(cid:27)etive photoathode overage smaller than the spei(cid:28)a-

tion, or that the PMTs are less sensitive in a broad outer photoathode area,

ompared to the enter. This explanation is orroborated by the results of the

LNGS-INR group of the LENS ollaboration, whih has measured at Gran

Sasso an idential quartz prototype ell (cid:28)lled with an In hydroxy-arboxylate

sintillator [13℄. They have used 3′′ PMTs, whih ensure full overage of the ell

ends. Their reported results [25℄ are in agreement with our MC expetations.

7 Conlusions and outlook

In this paper we have desribed the work arried out at MPIK to design,

model, build and haraterize a prototype ell of an indium solar neutrino

detetor (cid:28)lled with a novel In-loaded sintillator developed by us (In-aa).

As a (cid:28)rst step toward the validation of the experimental onept, we have

experimentally demonstrated that light-piping via total internal re(cid:29)etion on

quartz and speular re(cid:29)etion by 3M-VM2000 mirror foil is adequate for a (cid:28)ne

segmented detetor.

We have then predited by Monte Carlo the expeted optial performanes

of an In-aa ell as a funtion of the sintillator omposition, in order to

optimize the formulation at any given indium onentration.

After this preparatory phase, we have set up a prototype ell and a system

to measure the detetor optial performanes. A benhmark PXE-based sin-

tillator has shown an e(cid:27)etive long-range attenuation length of ∼

4.2 m and

26

a photo-eletron yield of ∼

730 pe/MeV. These results give the experimen-

tal upper limit of the potential of an In-based solar neutrino detetor in the

onsidered implementation.

Subsequently, three di(cid:27)erent In-loaded samples have been measured. At an

indium onentration of 44 g/l, the energy resolutions was ∼

11.6 % and the

7 m, both for 477 keV reoil eletrons. The long-range

spatial resolution ∼

attenuation length in the ell was ∼
200 pe/MeV.

1.3 m and the photo-eletron yield ∼

For all samples, the measured light attenuation was in good agreement with

the predition of our MC simulation, and the light output as well, after nor-

malization by an experimental quality fator of ∼

0.45. This means that we

an reliably predit the performane of this detetor for any hoie of the

sintillator omposition.

For our base-ase In-loading of 44 g/l, we found that the energy separation

between the In β end-point and the ν -signature is of the order of ∼

1.5 σ .

Aording to Monte Carlo studies of the full-sale detetor, this is not yet

su(cid:30)ient to guarantee an adequate signal/bakground ratio. However, we be-

lieve that there is still room to inrease the light output by simply improving

the math of the PMT surfae to the ell end. Unfortunately, the attenuation

length we measured (whih is (cid:29)uor-dominated) would limit the length of the

unitary ell to . 1.5 m.

The long-term stability of any metal-loaded sintillator is one of the ruial

issues for the feasibility of a neutrino detetor. We have demonstrated the our

system is stable and robust. This sintillator did not show any degradation

of its optial performane for a period of > 1 y, in spite of the very high

27

indium onentration and storage in an unproteted environment. This result

is of great interest not only for a solar neutrino detetor, but also for loading

of Gd in a novel liquid sintillator, to use in upoming reator anti-neutrino

detetors [26℄.

A prototype ell (cid:28)lled with a sintillator similar to the In-h2 sample reported

here has been installed in the LLBF, as a part of the LENS pilot experiment at

Gran Sasso [8℄. The bakground above the

the rate resulted only of a fator of ∼

PXE ells.

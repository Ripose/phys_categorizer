Abstract. We present the ﬁrst experimental conﬁrmation of the so-called “self-
phase-locked delay interferometry”. This laser frequency stabilization technique
consists basically in comparing the prompt laser signal with a delayed version of itself
that has been reﬂected in another LISA satellite 5 · 109 m away.

unity gain frequency is not limited by the inverse of the used delay (1.6 µs). In the
time domain the system also behaves as predicted, including the appearance of a
quasi-periodic “ringing” just after the lock acquisition, which decays exponentially. Its
initial amplitude is smaller when the loop gain is slowly ramped up instead of suddenly
switched on.

1. Motivation

LISA is an ESA-NASA project to detect gravitational waves, involving three spacecraft
ﬂying in an equilateral triangle formation approximately 5 million kilometres apart.
Together, they will act as a Michelson interferometer, covering a frequency range from
0.1 mHz to 1 Hz and having a typical strain sensitivity of 10−23 [1].

The phase noise of the LISA lasers would limit the sensitivity of the interferometer
despite the use of traditional frequency stabilization techniques such as Pound-Drever-
Hall with a stable reference cavity. TDI [2] represents an option to overcome this problem
by postprocessing the acquired data. Nevertheless, it requires high performance of the

pre-stabilization methods mentioned before and it becomes more complicated when
spacecraft motions are taken into account.

A traditional approach used with ground based detectors consists in locking the
laser frequency to the arms of the interferometer. The LISA arms are good candidates
for this technique due to their exceptional stability in the measurement frequency band,
but the delay caused by the roundtrip travel time between two satellites (33 s) had long
been considered an insurmountable limitation. The control bandwith of this kind of
loop is typically reduced to frequencies well below the inverse of this delay [3], but that
would mean a fraction of 30 mHz control bandwidth for LISA whereas very high gain at
these frequencies is necessary to make the stabilization useful. Recently, some groups
(see [4], [5] and [6]) have come up with control proposals and simulations achieving
the necessary bandwidth and gain, what has been called the “self-phase-locked delay
interferometry”. This paper describes an experimental demonstration of the principle
of operation and the performance of the technique using an electrical model system.

A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is stabilized in its frequency using a delay
of τ = 1.6 µs realized by 300 m of coaxial cable, and exhibiting the highest unity gain
frequency (UGF) of the control loop beyond 1/τ .

The predicted noise suppression was conﬁrmed by a direct measurement of the
oscillator’s signal. In the time domain, a quasi-periodic, exponential decaying transient
that was predicted to appear just after the lock acquisition ([4] and [7]) could also be
experimentally conﬁrmed. Furthermore, its initial amplitude is reduced when the loop
is closed by ramping up the gain instead of abruptly switching the loop on.

Referring to Figure 1, an oscillator signal is split into two paths. After one of them
has undergone a delay τ , they are recombined, and a phasemeter detects their phase
diﬀerence ∆Φ. When the loop is closed, ∆Φ is used as the error signal r(t) for a control
system (servo) with frequency response G(s). The output of the servo (feedback signal)

v(t) compensates the frequency ﬂuctuations p(t) of the oscillator . Finally, q(t) is the
frequency noise remaining in the stabilized system. In this paper the time will be called
t and we will use the Laplace variable s = iω. Functions in the frequency domain are
written with upper case letters and those in the time-domain in lower case letters. We
will refer to the “system” as the whole stabilization loop, consisting of the “servo” and
the “plant”.

In our experiment (see Figure 3 and Table 1) the role of the LISA laser is played by
a VCO working at approximately 72 MHz. Instead of the two times 5·109 m pathlength
between two LISA spacecraft, one of the signals goes through 300 m low-loss coaxial cable
which causes a delay of 1.6 µs. The inverse of the delay is 625 kHz, and the frequency
range equivalent to the LISA measurement window goes from 2 kHz to 20 MHz.

In this section we will compare the theoretical response of the phasemeter ∆Φ to
frequency noise p(t) of the oscillator with the one measured in our prototype in the open
loop case. Note that we actuate on the frequency of the oscillator instead of its phase,
which results in an extra factor of 1/f in the transfer function with respect to [4]. After
that, we will discuss the open loop gain (OLG) and present the characteristics of the
servo.

2.1. Transfer function

The transfer function of the plant without servo (see Figure 1), measured from the
frequency ﬂuctuations of the oscillator p(t) (expressed in rad/s) to the phasemeter
output ∆Φ (expressed in rad) can be written as

Htheo(iω) =

1 − exp(−iωτ )
iω

= τ

sin(ωτ /2)
(ωτ /2)

exp(−iωτ /2).

Figure 2 shows the Nyquist and Bode representations of this function together
with the data measured on the prototype. A model has been ﬁtted to the data that
additionally includes an extra delay τ ∗ of 75 ns. This delay τ ∗ accounts for eﬀects in the
VCO, the short interferometer arm and the phasemeter. The total eﬀect is modelled by
one single delay τ ∗ at the phasemeter output (see Figure 3). The model also includes
additional poles at ω1, ω3 and a zero at ω2 for the not ideal frequency response of the
diﬀerent components and is given by:

The highest unity gain frequency (UGF) takes place at about 3.5 MHz (see Figure 4),
clearly above the inverse of the delay (625 kHz).

point, the system becomes unstable.
In this representation, the additional phase lag
τ ∗ causes a clockwise rotation of the spiral-like gain curve and thus limits both the
loop bandwidth and the gain of the servo. It is important to distinguish between this
spurious delay τ ∗ that appears in the control loop after the signals have recombined and
the intended delay τ that is applied to only one of the split signals.

2.3. Controller

Our controller (Figure 6) consists of alternating poles and zeros at frequencies 106.6 kHz,
172.4 kHz, 843.7 kHz, 1.8 MHz, producing a frequency response approaching f 0.3 between
200 kHz and 1 MHz. Besides, there is an extra integrator from DC to 100 kHz in order
to increase the noise suppression in this region.

Figure 6. Frequency response of the used servo and a ﬁt to the measured data.

The starting point for such a controller design is the theory presented in [4]. The
only diﬀerence is that Sheard et al. consider the frequency actuator as part of the
controller rather than of the plant. This corresponds to taking a factor of 1/f from the
transfer function presented here and giving it to the servo frequency response, which
then becomes f −0.7.

3. Results

This section describes measurements of the noise behavior of the oscillator and compares
them with the theory. The signal of the oscillator (72 MHz) is directly sampled at
1 GHz. A software phasemeter performs a Single Bin Discrete Fourier Transformation
on it ([8],[9]) and delivers a time series of the oscillator’s phase q(t) at 72 MHz data rate
(see Figure 3). We will study this signal in both the time and the frequency domain.

3.1. Frequency domain

For the measurement shown in Figure 7, white frequency noise (p(t) in Figure 3) has
been added into the system thus generating phase noise with a 1/f linear spectral density

(LSD). Once the system is stabilized, the remaining noise Q(s) can be seen in the dotted
curve which shows noise reduction at certain frequencies above 1/τ . Superimposed to
this curve, the disturbance sensitivity function

P (iω)C(iω) =

P (iω)
|1 + OLG(iω)|

(6)

is plotted, where P (iω) is the LSD of the introduced frequency noise and OLG(iω) is
the measured OLG presented in Section 2.2. The reasonably good agreement between
the two curves conﬁrms the predicted noise suppression.

3.2. Time domain investigations

The time evolution of the oscillator’s phase during lock acquisition is analyzed here. For
all the ﬁgures of this subsection, the controller is turned on at t = 0 and time units
are scaled to τ . For the solid curves, the gain of the controller was turned on abruptly,
whereas for the dashed ones the gain was ramped up linearly during approximately
16 µs (10 τ ).

Figure 8 shows the transient for these two cases with white frequency noise added
as described in Section 3.1. As predicted in [4] and [7], a pseudo-periodic transient can
be observed just after the lock acquisition, whose initial amplitude is smaller when the
gain is ramped up as opposed to the case of abrupt switching.

The remaining noise is shown in the graph on the left in Figure 9. It does not show
pure repetition but a structure typical to the sum of pseudo-harmonic narrow-band
noise. This structure originates from the ﬁltering done by the controller, as can be seen
in Figure 7. On the right, 1/f noise is injected instead of white noise. It shows how the
system locks despite the strong perturbations that drive the phase of the oscillator over
several hundreds of radians before the stabilization is turned on.

4. Discussion

The “self-phase-locked delay interferometry” (see [4]) detects frequency ﬂuctuations
of a LISA laser by measuring the phase diﬀerence between the prompt laser signal
and a delayed (τ = 33 s) version of it that has been reﬂected on a diﬀerent LISA
In the hardware model presented here, the phase substraction takes place

between the signal from a VCO and a second version of it, delyed by τ = 1.6 µs.
Frequency ﬂuctuations of the VCO show up in our phase diﬀerence in the same way as
frequency ﬂuctuations of the laser do in the LISA conﬁguration, which has allowed us
the implementation of a frequency stabilization for the VCO based on the one described
in [4]. Although it takes place in a diﬀerent frequency range due to the small delay of
1.6 µs, it permits the experimental conﬁrmation of the main features of the “self-phase-
locked delay interferometry” .

First of all, the highest UGF of this kind of stabilizations is not limited to values far

under 1/τ , as was traditionally assumed (see [3]). This can be seen from the measured
OLG (Figure 4 and 5) and from the noise plots (Figure 7), in which frequency noise
reduction takes place at frequencies above 625 kHz (1/τ ) and the highest UGF appears
at about 3.5 MHz.

Actually, the performance of our loop is only limited by the spurious delay
τ ∗ = 75 ns present at the output of the phasemeter. This delay τ ∗ limits the bandwith
and gain of the servo as discussed in section 2.2. Such delays appear frequently in the
experimental realization of a phasemeter and therefore care should be taken to minimize
them in further implementations of this technique.

The frequency noise of the oscillator gets reduced when the stabilization is turned
on, as can be seen in Figure 7 for the frequency domain and Figure 8 and 9 for the time
domain. This noise reduction is also in agreement with the performance that derives
from the measured OLG (Figure 7).

Our hardware model of the“self-phase-locked delay interferometry” demonstrates
that the 33 s delay present in LISA does not represent a fundamental limitation in the
performance of the stabilization. The combination of the technique discussed here,
together with TDI and its recent improvements [10], may take us to a shot noise limited
LISA without major hardware modiﬁcations in the actual baseline.

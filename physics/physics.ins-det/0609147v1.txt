Abstract

We analyze the phase-noise measurement methods in which correlation
and averaging is used to reject the background noise of the instrument.
All the known methods make use of a mixer, used either as a saturated
phase detector or as a linear synchronous detector. Unfortunately, AM
noise is taken in through the power-to-dc-oﬀset conversion mechanism
that results from the mixer asymmetry. The measurement of some mixers
indicates that the unwanted amplitude-to-voltage gain is of the order of
5–50 mV, which is 12–35 dB lower than the phase-to-voltage gain of the
mixer. In addition, the trick of setting the mixer at a sweet point—oﬀ
the quadrature condition—where the sensitivity to AM nulls, works only
with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers have not this sweet point.
Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from the oscillator under
test, it can not be rejected by correlation. At least not with the schemes
currently used. An example shows that at some critical frequencies the
unwanted eﬀect of AM noise is of the same order—if not greater—than
the phase noise. Thus, experimental mistakes are around the corner.

Introduction

The phase noise of oscillators and of two-port devices is a relevant issue in time-
and-frequency metrology, in experimental physics, in space exploration, and in
some ﬁelds of electronics, which include at least instrumentation, telecommuni-
cations, high speed digital circuits, and radar systems.

Let us introduce the quasi-perfect sinusoidal signal of frequency ν0

vi(t) = V0[1 + α(t)] cos[2πν0t + ϕ(t)] ,

(1)

in which ϕ(t) and α(t) are the random phase ﬂuctuation and the normalized
random amplitude ﬂuctuation, respectively. Phase noise is usually described in
term of Sϕ(f ), namely, the power spectral density (PSD) of ϕ(t) as a function
of the Fourier frequency f . Similarly, Sα(f ) is the PSD of α(t). In practice,
the PSD is measured as the average square modulus of the one-sided Fourier
transform normalized for the power-type signals. Sϕ(f ) is used to describe fast
ﬂuctuations, while time-domain measurements are preferred for slow ﬂuctua-
tions. The boundary is generally set at 10−2 to 1 Hz. The general background
on phase noise and on frequency stability is available from numerous references,
among which we prefer [Cg94, Kro83, Vig99, CCI90].

Phase noise is measured by means of a phase detector followed by a low-noise
dc ampliﬁer and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyzer. In most cases the
detector is a saturated double-balanced mixer [Nel04, Agi04, Aer]. A balanced
bridge (often referred to as ‘interferometer’) with ampliﬁcation and synchronous
detection of the noise sidebands is used when the highest sensitivity is required
[San68, Lab82]. The sensitivity is limited by the equivalent temperature of the
instrument [ITW98]. Improved sensitivity is obtained by correlation and aver-
aging, with two separate—thus independent—systems that measure the same
device under test (DUT) [VMV64, WSGG76]. The dual-bridge with correlation
exhibits the highest reported sensitivity, limited by the thermal uniformity of
the instrument instead of the absolute temperature [RG00].

We observed that amplitude noise (AM noise), always present in the system,
limits the sensitivity by breaking the hypothesis of statistical independence.
The steeper is the spectrum slope (1/f and 1/f 2), more disturbing is the eﬀect
at low Fourier frequencies. Thus, we stress the importance of AM noise in
the emerging domain microwave photonics [Cha02], where the laser RIN has a
spectrum 1/f 2 at low frequencies. Unfortunately, little information on AM noise
is available (see Ref. [Rub05]). A careful analysis of the correlation schemes is
necessary to understand the eﬀect of AM noise and when it can be reduced or
eliminated. After that, the measurement of the detector parameters turns out
to be surprisingly simple.

2 Phase noise measurements

Saturated by two signals of power of 3–30 mW (5–15 dBm) in quadrature with
one another, the Schottky-diode double-balanced mixer (Fig. 1) works as a phase
detector governed by

vo(t) = kϕϕ(t) .

(2)

The phase-to-voltage gain kϕ is an experimental coeﬃcient that depends on
technology and on power. Actual values are of 0.1–0.5 V/rad. It turns out that

Conversely, the background white noise comes from the dc preampliﬁer at the

Figure 2 shows the basic correlation schemes for the measurement of phase
noise. The light shadows indicate the sources of noise removed by correlation
and averaging, while the dark shadows emphasize the points in which the eﬀect
of AM noise enters in the cross spectrum.

The scheme A is used to measure a two-port DUT [WSGG76]. In order to
reject the phase noise of the reference oscillator, the DUT group delay must
be small. Phase adjustment is necessary to ensure the quadrature relationship.
Ampliﬁcation or attenuation is needed if the DUT power does not ﬁt the mixer
input range. Yet, the 1/f phase noise of the ampliﬁer is generally higher than
that of the mixer.

The scheme B serves to measure the phase noise of an oscillator. This scheme
is routinely used at the NIST for the measurement of low-noise oscillators using
commercial synthesizers as the references [Nel04]. A tight loop is advantageous
vs. a loose loop [Aud80] because it overrides the stray injection-locking, some-
times hardly avoidable, and because it relaxes the need for large dynamic range
in the DAC converter of the FFT. Of course, the loop transfer function is to be
measured accurately and taken away.

The scheme C makes use of two reference resonators that turns the oscillator
frequency noise into phase noise at the mixer inputs. The maximum frequency
for the measurement of phase noise is limited by the resonator bandwidth. Be-
yond, the resonators attenuates the oscillator carrier, for the mixer is no longer
saturated. The reference resonator can be replaced with a delay line [LSL84].
In this case, the maximum frequency is limited by the inverse delay. A de-
lay longer than 10–100 ns can only be obtained with a photonic delay line
[RSHM05, SYMR04] because the loss of a coaxial cable is too high (
1 dB/m
at 10 GHz for a 0.141-inch semirigid cable), while the optical ﬁber exhibits a loss
of 0.2 dB/km (Corning SMF-28 at λ = 1.55 µm). The single-channel version
of the scheme C has been used to stabilize an oscillator either to a resonator
[GBW+84] or to an optical-ﬁber delay line [LMS91].

Figure 3: Basic dual-channel (correlation) spectrum measurement.

In the scheme D, the mixer works in small-signal regime at the RF port,
where only the ampliﬁed DUT noise is present. The phase-to-voltage gain is
kϕ = g
2ℓ √R0P0, minus dissipative losses [RG00]. R0 is the characteristic resis-
tance (50 Ω), P0 the DUT output power, g is the voltage gain of the ampliﬁer,
and ℓ the ssb voltage loss of the mixer (in our early publications, g and ℓ referred
to power gain and loss). Thus, if R0 = 50 Ω, P0 = 10 mW (10 dBm), g = 100
(40 dB), and ℓ = 2 (the usual 6 dB loss of a mixer), the gain is kϕ
17.7 V/rad.
At the high sensitivity of the bridge, the 1/f noise of the variable phase shifter
and attenuator shows up. The single bridge can also be used to measure or to
stabilize an oscillator [ITW98].

Owing to the asymmetry of the diodes and of the baluns (transformers),
the mixer (Fig. 1) is not perfectly balanced. Hence, the signal power aﬀects
the dc oﬀset at the mixer output. Consequently, the AM noise taken in in this

way can not be rejected by correlation. Nulling the sensitivity to AM noise
is an issue, which can be tackled by playing on power and on the quadrature
relationship. This was reported long time ago with old HF mixers [BOM75]. It
was also suggested that the mixer can be set to a sweet point, oﬀ the quadrature
condition, where the sensitivity to AM noise nulls, and the mixer is still a
valuable phase detector. A similar approach was followed in [CRTL02], with
microwave mixers. Yet, nothing is said about the generality of the method
versus the mixer type, and versus the measurement scheme.

First, we observed experimentally that the output of a saturated mixer is of

the form

vo(t) = kϕ ϕ(t) + klr α(t)

(scheme A)

(6)

if the two inputs see the same AM noise, of the form

vo(t) = kϕ ϕ(t) + kl αl(t) + kr αr(t)

(B and C)

(7)

if the two input see separate AM noises, and that Eq. (7) turns into

vo(t) = kϕ ϕ(t) + ksd αl(t)

(scheme D)

(8)

for the bridge scheme, where only the LO port is saturated. The subscripts l
and r refer to LO and to RF, and sd to synchronous detection.

The scheme A is a simple case. As the AM noise is described by

x(t) = (klr)a α(t)
y(t) = (klr)b α(t) ,

the two variable phases can be adjusted separately for the corresponding mixer
to operate at the sweet point, if it exists.

The scheme B is unfortunate because the AM noise is governed by

x(t) = (kr)a α(t)
y(t) = (kr)b α(t)

ha(t) + (kl)a α(t)
hb(t) + (kl)b α(t) .

∗

∗

The convolution (
) with the resonator low-pass transfer function h de-correlates
∗
the DUT AM noise at inputs of the mixer by introducing the resonator group
delay in one branch. This de-correlation eﬀect is inevitable because it is the
same mechanism exploited to measure the DUT PM noise. Of course, there is
no way to null both kr and kl of the same mixer by playing with the phase
around the quadrature. Unless this occurs unexpectedly, out of good luck.

The scheme C is ruled by

x(t) = (kl)a αa(t) + (kr)a αdut(t)
y(t) = (kl)b αb(t) + (kr)b αdut(t) .

In this case, the AM noise of the reference oscillators is rejected by correlation
because the two oscillators are independent. It is therefore suﬃcient to null the
two kr. Of course the sweet point, if exists, is not the same as for the scheme A.
The oﬀ-quadrature phase is set by adding a dc term at the input of the phase-
lock circuit. A sharp null is found by inspecting on the mixer output with a

must have no residual phase modulation.

In the scheme D, the eﬀect of the AM noise is

x(t) = (ksd)a α(t)
y(t) = (ksd)b α(t) .

(15)

(16)

The need for AM noise rejection may depend on the microwave gain that pre-
cedes the mixer because this parameter inﬂuences the ratio kϕ/ksd. Yet, even if
there is only one parameter, it can not be nulled by oﬀsetting the phase. This
occurs because the synchronous detection detects the DUT noise according to

x(t)

α(t) sin γ + ϕ(t) cos γ ,

(17)

∝
where γ is the phase of the mixer LO signal. Consequently, γ
= 0 results in the
DUT AM noise to be mistaken for PM noise. The solution, if any, comes from
quite a diﬀerent approach. We are exploring a chopper technique, similar to the
Dicke radiometer [Dic46].

4 Mixer measurement

We validate our analysis with the experiments of Fig. 4, which also provide
the actual parameters of some mixers. The mixers are selected among those
routinely used in our laboratory, and tested in the same conditions as in the
measurement of phase noise. These mixers are not special devices for phase noise

4.1 Microwave mixers

Out of experimental selection, we found an amplitude modulator that shows a
null of residual phase modulation at a given dc bias, where the device also shows
a suﬃciently small attenuation (1.5 dB). This loss is compensated by changing
the source power in Fig. 3 A and D, and with an attenuator in Fig. 3 B and
10−2 V−1 (0.625 dB/V). In order to

bandwidth of the modulation channel, from the ac input of the sum node to
the output of the dc ampliﬁer, is large (1 MHz, limited by the dc ampliﬁer) as
compared to the measurement frequency (10 kHz), thus there is no phase lag.
The lock-in ampliﬁer is set for the measurement of the real part, so it keeps
the sign.
In actual phase noise measurements, it is vital to understand that
this setting detects the sweet point as a smooth zero crossing. Conversely, the

measurement of the modulus shows a sharp cusp, hard to identify properly. The
lock-in can be replaced with a dual-channel FFT analyzer, used to measure the
real part of the voltage ratio.

We measured a few microwave mixers in saturated conditions, modulating
the amplitude at one input, as in Fig. 4 B-C. An example of results is reported
in Fig. 5.

With the Narda mixer, kl and kr show similar slope at diﬀerent frequencies
and power. The curves are shifted towards right as frequency increases. This
makes one think to a systematic phase shift in the baluns. In fact, the inside of
a microwave mixer diﬀers from Fig. 1 in that the transformers are replaced with
microstrip networks. In all the reported conditions, the null of AM sensitivity
is clearly visible. Yet it occurs at a phase up to 20◦ oﬀ the quadrature, which
may be too large. A lower kϕ at this large phase oﬀset is only a minor problem.
The main problem is that the dc output voltage (100 mV) is too large for the
precision dc ampliﬁer that follows. In fact, a gain of 40 dB or more is often
needed to override the input noise of commercial FFTs.

In the case of the Pulsar mixer, we observe that kl and kr can change sign
unexpectedly with frequency, and that power has a minor eﬀect. On the other
5◦ around the quadrature,
hand, the nulls are well clustered in a region of
where the output voltage is within 30 mV.

The variable phase was set for the output to be 0 V dc. We observe that ksd
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from kl. This is related to the fact that kl is measured
with the RF port is saturated, while ksd is measured with the RF terminated.
Additionally, we notice that klr diﬀers signiﬁcantly from kl + kr. This is the
signature of a bizarre saturated interaction, which indicates that there is no way
to forecast a result by adding separate eﬀects.

Figure 6 shows the eﬀect of power and frequency on two mixers. Most of the
change in the AM sensitivity is due to frequency. The same fact was observed
on other devices, not reported here. This reinforces the idea of systematic phase
errors in the baluns. Understanding this eﬀect is diﬃcult because the literature
is old (see for example [Kol84, Maa93]), and the actual design is conﬁdential.
Nonetheless, there is a simple physical interpretation. Common sense suggests
that the baluns are designed for the lowest power change in the desired frequency
range. In practice, this is close to the condition of maximally ﬂat amplitude as
a function of frequency. The amplitude vs. phase relationship is governed by
the Cauchy-Riemann condition for the uniqueness of the derivative in analytic
functions. Accordingly, the phase vs. frequency function has the steepest slope
where the amplitude vs. frequency function is ﬂat.

4.2 HF-VHF mixers

The selected mixers are suitable to the frequency range of 1–500 MHz, limited
by the toroidal transformers. This range is typical for such devices. Driven
at some 5–6 mW (7–8 dBm), the phase-to-voltage gain kϕ is of about 220
mV/rad, some 20% lower than that of microwave mixers. The general behavior
is rather uniform over the bandwidth, for there is no point in sweeping the
frequency in small steps. Thus, we choose two frequencies, 6 MHz and 200
MHz, determined by a speciﬁc application [BGB+06], and close enough to the
frequencies of general interest (5, 10, 100 MHz). The measurement system
diﬀers slightly from Fig 4 B and C. We used two synthesizers driven by the
same frequency standard, one adjusted in phase and the other modulated in
amplitude with α = 10−2 by a 1 kHz signal from the lock-in ampliﬁer. We
focused on the schemes B-C. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Surprisingly, in
most cases there is no sweet point of zero sensitivity to AM. The sweet point is
present only in some speciﬁc conditions of power and frequency. Yet, it appears
at a large phase shift, up to 40◦, where kϕ drops and the mixer is no longer
usable as a phase detector. Besides, the large dc oﬀset (up to 150 mV) makes the
dc ampliﬁer problematic. Qualitative inspection on some other mixers conﬁrms
that this behavior is rather general.

5 Final remarks

In the measurement of an oscillator the rejection of AM noise relies only on the
mixer. The AM noise of the reference can be rejected by correlation if two inde-
pendent references are used (Fig. 2 C). Yet, correlation provides no rejection of
the AM noise of the oscillator under test. The eﬀect can be surprisingly high.

Phase noise comes from the manufacturer speciﬁcations, while the 1/f ampli-

rejection (kϕ/kl, kϕ/kr, or kϕ/klr) is lower than some 20 dB, an experimental
error shows up in the region of 3 kHz. Of course, the mixer rejection can be
signiﬁcantly lower than 20 dB.

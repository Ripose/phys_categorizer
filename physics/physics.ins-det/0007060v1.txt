The BABAR Calorimeter Light Pulser System

P.J. Clark1)

Abstract

To make precision measurements with a CsI(Tl) calorimeter in a high luminosity environment requires
that the crystals are well calibrated and continually monitored for radiation damage. This should not eﬀect
the total integrated luminosity which is particularly important for the BABAR calorimeter to enable it to
make CP violation measurements in the B meson system. To achieve this goal a ﬁbre-optic light pulser
system was designed using xenon ﬂash lamps as the light source. A novel light distribution method was
developed using an array of graded index microlenses. Some initial results from performance studies are
presented.

Introduction

The light pulser system monitors short term changes in the response of the BABAR calorimeter [1].
It also
provides a useful and ﬂexible diagnostic tool for the entire readout chain of the calorimeter from light collection
through to data acquisition. The system is designed to have a stability of 0.5% over a period of around one
week. It can also monitor long term changes in the calorimeter response to an accuracy of 1% using a reference
system which cross-calibrates the intensity of the light pulses against a radioactive source.

Figure 1: Overview of the light pulser system

The overall design of the light pulser system is shown in ﬁgure 1. There are two high stability xenon ﬂash
lamps manufactured by Hamamatsu (type L4633). One of the lamps supplies the barrel and the other supplies
the endcap calorimeter. The light produced from the xenon lamps is spectrally ﬁltered to match the emission
spectrum of CsI scintillation light.
It is then attenuated by two neutral density ﬁlters to allow the correct
equivalent energy in the calorimeter crystals to be selected. The light ﬁlls a light mixer bar which uniformly
illuminates a bundle of 400 µm multi-mode ﬁbres which deliver the light to the individual calorimeter modules.
At each module there is a module mixer which takes the light from each ﬁbre and illuminates a close-packed
bundle of 200 µm ﬁbres which transport light to individual CsI crystals. The light is injected into the rear face
of each crystal and then diﬀusely reﬂects within the crystal. This eﬀectively imitates the crystal scintillation
light produced by the energy deposition of an electromagnetic shower. The light is then readout using the full
BABAR calorimeter electronic readout chain from the photodiodes right through to the data acquistion. The
light pulser system produces an equivalent energy in the calorimeter which is high enough to allow it to be run
with beam backgrounds in the detector. A more detailed description is given elsewhere [2].

There is a reference system to take out instabilities in the light source. Fibres are routed from the primary
mixer systems to the reference system. The reference system itself is cross-calibrated against a mixed alpha
source (148Gd and 241Am). Both the alpha source and the reference ﬁbres are attached to a small CsI crystal
which is readout by a photomultiplier tube and a photodiode. The reference system data from both source
events and light pulses is collected in the multi-event buﬀer of a 12 bit peak sensing ADC (CAEN V556S). The
source events are accumulated continuously in the buﬀer and readout using a 1 Hz software trigger. The readout
of light pulser system events is triggered from a signal which is derived from the photomultiplier tube in the
reference system. This is more accurate than using the input signal to the lamp trigger power supply because
there is a time jitter of 200 ns in the lamp response with respect to the trigger. The lamps are triggered at a
frequency of 14.2 Hz which comes from dividing the BABAR clock.

Figure 2: The principle of the microlens

In the endcap system graded index microlenses (Newport LGI630-3) are used to ensure that all the light
modes in the 400 µm ﬁbres are ﬁlled correctly. This led to a better uniformity in the energy distribution.
Conventional ﬁbre optics rely upon having a step refractive index where the ﬁbre core is at a higher refractive
index than the cladding. Graded index ﬁbre optics however do not have a separate core and cladding. Instead
they have a refractive index that varies radially. This results in an optical ray following a sinusoidal path down
the ﬁbre rather than discrete total internal reﬂections, see ﬁgure 2. An interesting feature of these ﬁbres is if
they are cut at speciﬁc lengths they act as minature lenses. If an optical ray completes one sinusoidal oscillation
within the lens it is said to have a pitch of 1.0. For our case lenses with a pitch of 0.25 allow a collimated light
source to be focused. This is ideal for input into a ﬁbre optic. Each lens is coated in an anti-reﬂection coating
(MgF2) to maximise its transmission. The type of lens which was chosen was plano-plano meaning that the
lens is terminated perpendicularly at both ends.

Figure 3: The stability of the light pulser system

It is important for the light pulser system to have as high a pulse-to-pulse stability as possible. In ﬁgure 3
the stability of the system is shown. This is produced by a Gauss ﬁt to the energy distribution in each channel.
The data is normalised to the mean energy in each calorimeter module on a pulse-to-pulse basis. There are a
small number of noisy channels due to preliminary electronics problems.

4 Summary

Using the light pulser data from the inner ring of crystals in the endcap calorimeter, where maximum radiation
damage occurs, it is possible to obtain a correlation between the total integrated luminosity of data taken by
BABAR and the diﬀerential radiation damage in the endcap. This is the radiation damage to the inner ring with
respect to the rest of the endcap. The correlation is shown in ﬁgure 4. This demonstrates that the light pulser
system can measure accurately very small changes in the response of the BABAR calorimeter.

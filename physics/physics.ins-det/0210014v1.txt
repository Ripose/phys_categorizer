Abstract

We describe a new type of magnetic ﬁeld sensor which is termed an Electro-
Mechanical Resonant Sensor (EMRS). The key part of this sensor is a small
conductive elastic element with low damping rate and therefore a high Q
fundamental mode of frequency f1. An AC current is driven through the
elastic element which, in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, causes an AC force
on the element. When the frequency of the AC current matches the resonant
frequency of the element, maximum vibration of the element occurs and this
can be measured precisely by optical means.

We have built and tested a model sensor of this type using for the elastic
element a length of copper wire of diameter 0.030 mm formed into a loop
shape. The wire motion was measured using a light emitting diode photo-
transistor assembly. This sensor demonstrated a sensitivity better than
0.001G for an applied magnetic ﬁeld of ∼ 1G and a good selectivity for
the magnetic ﬁeld direction. The sensitivity can be easily improved by a
factor of ∼ 10 − 100 by more sensitive measurement of the elastic element
motion and by having the element in vacuum to reduce the drag force.

Introduction

There are several types of magnetic ﬁeld sensors in common use. Included
are compass needles, Hall probes, ﬂux-gate magnetometers, and SQUIDs
(superconductive quantum interference devices). The compass needle was
discovered ∼ 2000 years ago by the Chinese. Other types of sensors were
developed relatively recently. The ﬁeld of application of the diﬀerent sen-
sors clearly depends on the required accuracy, sensitivity, and expense. A
compass needle is simple and does not require electric power or circuits but

1

it indicates only the ﬁeld direction. Hall probes are more sophisticated de-
vices which can measure ﬁelds over a large range of ﬁeld strengths. They
are simple to use, but have problems related to baseline drift and high
sensitivity to ambient temperature changes, and they tend to have noisy
signals. Their typical resolution is ∼ 10−3, but with special precautions it
can reach 5 × 10−4. Flux-gate magnetometers are versatile and sensitive but
require sophisticated signal processing which tends to limit the frequency
band of their response. The most advanced type of magnetic ﬁeld sensors
are SQUIDs (super-conductive quantum interference devices). These probes
can measure magnetic ﬁelds with extremely high precision, but they require
liquid nitrogen or liquid helium to operate and sophisticated electronics.
That makes this type of probe expensive and limits its range of application.
In this paper we discuss a new type of inexpensive magnetic ﬁeld sensor
which is depicted in Figure 1. The sensor is a highly miniaturized version
of the vibrating wire ﬁeld measuring technique (Temnykh 1997). In §2 we
brieﬂy consider the theory and in §3 we give the results of measurements on
a model EMR sensor. In §4 we give a summary.

2 Theory

Here we brieﬂy consider properties of an elastic loop sketched in Figure 2.
Assume that both ends of the loop, A and B, are ﬁxed. A torque T applied
to the loop will cause it to tilt through an angle α around horizontal x−axis,
where

πSd4
16L
where S is the shear modulus of the wire, d the wire diameter, L is the “arm”
length indicated in Figure 2 (see for example Brekhovskikh & Goncharov
1993). For copper S ≈ 0.42 × 1011Pa, with Pa ≡ N/m2.

T =

α .

Consider now a DC current I ﬂowing through the loop. The Lorentz
force between the current in the loop and the vertical magnetic ﬁeld By
gives a torque about the x−axis approximately

where H and R are deﬁned in Figure 2. In the equilibrium, TI = (πSd4/16L)α,
so that

For the loop parameters indicated in the caption of Figure 2, and By = 110G
(used in the tests described below), we obtain

δz[mm]
I[A]

≈ 0.294 .

The measured dependence discussed in §3.3 is δz[mm]/I[A] ≈ 0.35. This is
consistent with the analytic calculation if account is taken of the approxi-
mate equation (2) for the torque.

The lowest frequency of vibration f1 of the loop can be estimated as

follows. The moment of inertia of the loop about the x−axes is

For the loop dimensions shown in Figure 2 and for the copper wire used
(ρℓ = 8.9 × 103kg/m
), equation (8) gives f1 ≈ 280Hz. This is consistent
with the measured resonance frequency discussed in §3.2, f1 ≈ 259Hz.

(Landau & Lifshitz 1959), with γ ≈ 0.577 Euler’s constant, with vp the peak
velocity of the top of the loop, and with ν = η/ρair ≈ 1.5 × 10−5m2/s the
kinematic viscosity of air. Equation (9) implies that the quality factor for the
vibrations is Q = 2πf1I/K. For the displacement amplitudes discussed in
§3.2, the Reynolds numbers Re = vpd/ν are indeed less than unity, and this
formula gives the prediction Q ≈ 297 which is larger than the measured value
of 198 (§3.2). We believe that this diﬀerence is due to the approximations
in the theory of the drag coeﬃcient K.

EMR Sensor Tests

We built a number of models of EMR sensors. One of these are shown
schematically in Figures 1 and 2. The elastic element was fabricated from
a 0.030mm diameter copper wire formed into a loop shape diagrammed in
Figure 2. The fundamental mode of vibration corresponds to the top of the
loop moving in the z−direction in Figure 2. To measure position of the loop
we used a “Π” shaped opto-electronic assembly H21A1 (Newark Electronics)
consisting of a light-emitting-diode (LED) on one leg of the assembly and
a photo-transistor on other. The light ﬂux detected by photo-transistor is
very sensitive to loop position.

In the following we give the characteristics of the EMR sensor compo-

nents and results of the sensor tests.

3.1 Calibration of Loop Position Sensor

The opto-electronic detector was calibrated by the moving the entire loop us-
ing a precise micro-screw and measuring the signal from the photo-transistor.
The measured dependence is shown in Figure 3.

One can see that in the range 0.7 − 1.1mm the signal from photo-

transistor is proportional to the loop displacement.

δU [mV]
δz[mm]

= 421

(10)

Here, δz is the change of the loop position, δU is the change in the detector
signal. δU = 1mV corresponds to a current δI = δU/R = 0.16µA through
In subsequent measurements,
the external circuit resistor R = 6.35kΩ.
the loop position was adjusted to be in the middle of the range of linear
dependence.

3.2 Elastic Element Resonance Response

Important characteristics of EMR probe are the fundamental resonance fre-
quency f1 and the quality factor Q. We measured these parameters by
driving an AC current with various frequencies through the element and
measuring amplitude of the AC signal from photo-transistor. In Figure 4
the measured amplitude ( RMS of AC voltage) is plotted as a function of
frequency f of the AC current.

The data was ﬁtted to the resonance formula

A =

A0
1 )2 + f 2f 2

1 /Q2

,

(f 2 − f 2

q

(11)

where, f1 is the resonance frequency, Q is the quality factor, and A0 is a
constant. This expression follows from equation (9). The ﬁt gave: f1 =
259Hz and Q = 198. Note that according to calibration 10 the maximum
of 16mV RMS of AC signal seen at resonance on Figure 4 corresponds to
±0.053mm of amplitude of vibration of the top of the loop. This small
amplitude indicates that the optical detector was operating in the linear
region of Figure 3. In this test the AC current amplitude trough the element
was 170mA and the magnetic ﬁeld was ∼ 0.5G.

3.3 Elastic Element Static Test

This test was done to measure the static properties of the elastic element.
A triangular AC current of low frequency of 1Hz was driven through the
element. A 110G vertical magnetic ﬁeld was imposed at the EMR probe
location by a permanent magnet. The Lorentz force between the magnetic
ﬁeld and current ﬂowing through the probe caused the loop displacement.
Figure 5 shows the current through the element, Iel, and photo-transistor
signal as a function of time. One can see the triangular wave current with
1sec period and photo-transistor signal with similar form. In Figure 6 the
signal is plotted as function of current. The right-hand vertical scale shows
the element displacement, z, calculated from the signal by using calibra-
tion 10. The data indicates a linear dependence of element displacement on
current,

δI[A]

≈ 0.365 ,

(12)

for the magnetic ﬁeld of 110G.

3.4 EMR Sensor Calibration and Comparison with a Hall

Probe

In this test a Hall probe was placed very close to the EMR probe. The Hall
probe orientation was accurately adjusted so that it sensed only the vertical
component of the magnetic ﬁeld, which is the component which causes the
vibration of elastic element in EMR probe. A sinusoidal AC current of peak
amplitude 85mA at the resonance frequency 259Hz was driven through the
element. The imposed magnetic ﬁeld was created by a small permanent
magnet. The ﬁeld strength was varied by accurately moving the permanent
magnet relative to the ﬁxed probes. Figure 7 shows the ﬁeld measured by
the Hall probe and the signal from the EMR sensor as a function of the test
magnet position.

The data shown in Figure 7 was used to calibrate the EMR probe. Fig-
ure 8 shows a plot of the EMR probe signal (RMS of AC voltage) versus
magnetic ﬁeld strength measured with Hall probe and ﬁtted it with linear
dependence. This ﬁt gives

δB[G]
δUAC [mV]

≈ 0.0518 .

(13)

(14)

That is, a 1mV change of the EMR probe signal indicates a 52mG change
of the magnetic ﬁeld strength.

Note that because the size of the test magnet was much smaller than the
distance between probes and the magnet, the dependence of the magnetic
ﬁeld strength on the position p can be approximated by

B(p) = C1 +

C2
(p − C3)3 .

Here, C1 is a parameter which represents either the background ﬁeld or
the zero drift for the Hall probe. The parameter C2 is proportional to the
testing magnet magnetic moment, The parameter C3 is set by the location
of the probe in coordinate system used to deﬁne testing magnet position.
The measurements with the Hall and EMR probes were ﬁtted with the
theoretical dependence 14 using C1, C2 and C3 as a free parameters. The
residual between measured data and theoretical ﬁt for both probes is shown
in Figure 9.

For the EMR probe the diﬀerence (measurement - ﬁt) was converted
into magnetic ﬁeld strength using equation (13). Note that at each point,
the signal from EMR probe was measured several times. Bars shown for the

6

EMR sensor data represent 1σ errors found from a statistical analysis of the
measurements.

We can now compare the diﬀerence between measurement and theoreti-
cal ﬁt for the EMR sensor and that for the Hall probe. For Hall probe RMS
the residual between measured data and theoretical ﬁt is 2.9 × 10−3G, which
is consists with the probe speciﬁcations. For our EMR sensor the residual
is 0.45 × 10−3G. That is, the EMR sensor is 6 times better!

4 Discussion

In future reﬁnements, an EMR sensor element optimized for sensitivity can
be developed. The geometry may be similar to that discussed above but the
wire can be of diameter d = 0.010mm and consist of 10 turns around the loop
shown in Figures 1 and 2. Scaling of our test results using equations ( 4) and
(8) gives a sensitivity 5 × 10−6G, resonance frequency ∼ 25Hz, and a peak
current amplitude 9.4mA where the current was scaled ∝ d2. The elastic
element can be vacuum encapsulated using nano-fabrication techniques. For
vacuum conditions where the mean-free-path is longer than the dimensions
of the loop, the friction coeﬃcient K in equation (9) is proportional to the
gas density or pressure. We estimate that the quality factor of the resonant
element can be increased to Q ∼ 103 − 104. This increase in Q will increase
the sensitivity by a factor ∼ 5 − 50. As a result the EMR sensor can
have a sensitivity of 1 × 10−6 to 10−7G. This is a few orders of magnitude
more sensitivity than a Hall probe, but of course it is not as sensitive as
SQUIDS. Note that the measurement times at the lowest ﬁeld levels need
to be ∼ 1 − 10min.

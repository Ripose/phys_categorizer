Abstract

In order to evaluate the response to cosmic-ray nuclei of a Compton-Scatter Transition Radiation Detector in
the proposed ACCESS space-based mission, a hybrid Monte Carlo simulation using GEANT3 and an external
transition radiation (TR) generator routine was constructed. This simulation was employed to study the eﬀects
of delta-ray production induced by high-energy nuclei and to maximize the ratio of TR to δ-ray background. The
results demonstrate the ability of a Compton-Scatter Transition Radiation Detector to measure nuclei from boron
to iron up to Lorentz factors γ ∼ 105 taking into account the steeply falling power-law cosmic ray spectra.

1. Introduction

The proposed Advanced Cosmic-ray Composi-
tion Experiment for Space Science (ACCESS) is
a dedicated space-based mission to perform di-
rect nuclear composition measurements up to near
the ‘knee’ of the cosmic-ray spectrum, E ∼ 106
GeV/nucleus [1]. One conﬁguration [2] employs a
nearly 6 meter3 Compton-Scatter Transition Ra-
diation Detector (CSTRD) in a cubic geometry
with a smaller calorimeter underneath. The abso-
lute size of the ACCESS instrument is driven by
the requirement to obtain signiﬁcant event statis-
tics in this ﬂux-poor energy regime while being
constrained by the achievable spacecraft size and
mass.

The Compton-scatter technique exploits the
facts that 1) the x-ray spectra of emitted TR
can be hardened by a judicious choice of radia-
tor material, thickness, and spacing and 2) the
greatest energy dependence of the TR is at high
frequencies [2]. For a radiator with thickness l1,
plasma frequency ω1, and spacing l2, interference
eﬀects from the superposition of amplitudes from
each interface yield pronounced maxima and min-
imum in the TR spectra. The highest frequency
maximum is at ωmax = l1ω2
2πc (1 + ρ) while the sat-
uration energy is γs ≈ 0.6ω1
c pl1l2(1 + ρ), where
ρ = 0 except for materials with complex dielectric
constants (i.e., metals) where ρ = 1. (In order to
be conservative, the simulations employed in this
study assume ρ = 0). Thus an ensemble of alu-

minum foil radiators with 100 − 200 µm thickness
separated by several mm leads to γs ≈ 105 and
~ωmax ≈ 130 keV (for ρ = 0). As the Compton-
scattering cross-section is signiﬁcant at these en-
ergies, these photons will scatter away from the
initiating particle’s trajectory and thus spatially
separate the TR signal from the ionization path.
Furthermore, the signiﬁcant ﬂux of x-rays with
energies > 50 keV can be detected with an in-
organic (e.g., CsI) scintillator. The principle of
Compton-scatter TRDs has been demonstrated in
accelerator test beams [3].

The thick radiators used to produce such hard
x-rays also induce δ-ray production. The impact of
this background is exacerbated in cosmic-ray mea-
surements by the vast number of sub-TR events
resulting from the power-law nature of the cosmic-
ray spectrum. The study presented in this paper
optimizes the CSTRD signal in relation to this
background.

2. Simulation Studies

A hybrid Monte Carlo simulation has been
constructed using GEANT3 [4] interfaced to an
external TR generator routine based on the for-
malism of Ter-Mikaelian [5]. GEANT3 models the
dominant electromagnetic processes in the energy
range 10 keV to 10 TeV with the cross-sections
smoothly extending to higher energies. For heavy
ions, ionization losses are simulated along with
the discrete process of δ-ray production. Hadronic
interactions are not simulated for heavy ions
in GEANT3, and the ACCESS calorimeter and
ancillary charge measurement detectors are not
modeled in this study.

Although multiple CSTRD conﬁgurations were
investigated, the results employing a radiator ar-
rangement with the highest TR saturation Lorentz
factor are presented. The conﬁguration consists of
a large radiator stack surrounded on all six sides by
highly segmented scintillators which measure both
the Compton-scattered TR and ionization losses,
thus providing the primary particle charge deter-
mination. The radiator consists of 150 Al foils with
150 µm thickness separated by 1 cm vacuum gaps

with an areal size of 160 × 160 cm2. The radiator
stack is surrounded by six 160 × 160 cm2 planes of
CsI scintillator in a cubic geometry. Each scintil-
lator module contains a layer of 2 mm thick CsI,
250 µm silicon PIN diode readout, and 5 mm of
G10 encapsulated in a 1 mm Al housing. The CsI
is segmented into 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 pixels with each
pixel recording the deposited energy on an event-
by-event basis with a 50 keV threshold energy.

The pixel TR energy distribution peaks at an
energy per pixel near 100 keV with nearly 100% of
the Compton-scattered TR signal being recorded
below 500 keV. The δ-ray pixel energy distribution
shows a low energy peak below 100 keV with a pro-
nounced tail extending well above 1 MeV. A pixel
energy selection of 50 ≤ Epixel < 500 keV retains
virtually 100% of the TR hit pixels while rejecting
> 40% of the δ-ray hits. The pixels recording the
ionization of the primaries and their nearest neigh-
bors are excluded in this pixel counting.

Table 1 details the response for normally inci-
dent carbon nuclei with γ > 105 for simulated TR
only, δ-ray background only, and signal + back-
ground. Note that the pixel occupancy is at such a
low level that summing the individual signal and
background samples equals the result for simulta-
neously simulating the two processes; i.e., there are
very few events in which a δ-ray and TR photon
hit the same pixel. The results indicate that the
signal is 48.79/3.65 = 13.4 times larger than the
background. By varying the scintillator thickness
from 1 to 8 mm, the signal/background ratio was
maximized at 2 mm CsI thickness. Furthermore,

was obtained by placing the scintillators on the
outside of the radiator stack versus interspersing
them within the stack. No signiﬁcant gain in the
signal/background ratio was obtained by rejecting
pixels further from the trajectory of the primary
than just the hit pixel plus nearest neighbors.

These simulations were performed using nuclear
primaries from boron to iron and incident energies
chosen from a ﬂat log E distribution to enhance
the measured high energy response. Figure 1 shows
the results for carbon and iron for TR + back-
ground and for δ-ray background alone. This radi-
ator conﬁguration yielded a mean saturated value
of ∼ 960 TR photons for carbon and ∼ 18, 000 TR
photons for incident iron nuclei with, on average,
∼ 27% (20%) of the TR photons at energies greater
than 50 (100) keV .

The eﬀective dynamic range of the TR mea-
surement is obtained from a statistical analysis.
Assuming a power law spectrum ϕ(E) ∼ E−α
and a TR threshold energy of Ethr, the num-
ber of events above the TR threshold goes as
1−α
Nsignal ∼ E
thr . Some number of sub-threshold
events accompanied by δ-rays will masquerade as
high-energy events with TR. If the number of these
misidentiﬁed low-energy events is required to be

no more than βNsignal, then the probability of a
low-energy event with δ-rays ﬂuctuating upward
to mimic the signal of a valid event above Ethr
must be no more than P = β(E0/Ethr)α−1. Using
the conservative values of α = 2.75, β = 0.01,
E0 = 1 GeV, and Ethr = 105 GeV, the probability
is evaluated as approximately 2 × 10−11 or ∼ 7 σ
assuming a single-sided Gaussian probability dis-
tribution function. Thus the low end of the TR
dynamic range is deﬁned as that energy where
the TR response is 7 σ above the average value of
the sub-TR response. On a power-law decreasing
spectrum, the ﬂux of particles at the high end of
the energy range is depleted as compared to lower
energies. Thus, the high end of the TR dynamic
range can have a more modest 2 σ separation
between the signal and the saturated TR value.

Table 2 details the eﬀective dynamic ranges for
various nuclear species based upon the results of
this analysis. As the data demonstrate, the mod-
eled CSTRD can measure the Lorentz factors of in-
cident nuclei from boron to iron. Furthemore, the
range of Lorentz factors that guarantee signal sep-
aration from the sub-TR background and the sat-
urated value signiﬁcantly increases as the atomic
number of the incident nuclei increases.

Although hadronic interactions of the incident
nuclei are not modeled for this study, an estimate
of the attenuating eﬀects of the relatively thick ra-
diators and CsI scintillators in the CSTRD can be
obtained by consideration of the nuclear inelastic
cross-sections. For iron primaries incident upon an
aluminum target, the nuclear interaction length is
given as 20.3 g/cm2 [6] while the grammage of the
CSTRD modeled in this study is 11.5 g/cm2. Thus,
approximately 43% of an incident iron ﬂux will
be lost due to hadronic inelastic collisions. Events
with charge-changing interactions will be recog-
nized by observing a diﬀerence in the charge mea-
surement of the particles entering versus exiting
the detector.

3. Conclusions

A Monte Carlo simulation has been employed to
simulate the response of a Compton-scatter tran-
sition radiation detector and to optimize the de-
sign with respect to the background process of δ-
ray production. The results indicate that a space-
based CSTRD can perform nuclear composition
measurements up to a Lorentz factor of 105. How-
ever, while the dynamic range is more than a factor
of 10 for cosmic-ray iron measurements, the range
is more limited for lower-Z nuclei due to the rela-
tive reduction in TR generation.

Abstract

We have applied laser calorimetry to the measurement of optical absorption in mono-
crystalline sapphire at cryogenic temperatures. Sapphire is a promising candidate
for the mirror substrates of the Large-scale Cryogenic Gravitational wave Telescope.
The optical absorption coeﬃcients of diﬀerent sapphire samples at a wavelength of
1.064 µm at 5 K were found to average 90 ppm/cm.

(GW). TAMA has already reached a stage where high quality data can be
taken for several hours at a time[5]. However, much more sensitive detectors
are planned because the estimated GW event rate for coalescing neutron star
binaries is extremely low even within the Virgo cluster (at a radius of 20 Mpc,
and the main target of LIGO and VIRGO). The important limitations to the
sensitivity of these interferometers are seismic vibration, thermal Brownian
noise of mirrors and their suspensions[6], and photon shot noise. Although
fused silica is used in present interferometers as the main mirror substrate,
it is not the best material for advanced GW interferometers, due to concerns
about thermal Brownian noise and thermal lensing[7,8] at very high optical
power. Another promising candidate material is mono-crystalline sapphire,
but concerns about thermo-elastic noise[9,10] render sapphire unsuitable if
used at room temperature.

We have been developing a cryogenic mirror technique to be used in the Large-
scale Cryogenic Gravitational wave Telescope (LCGT)[11]. Sapphire will be
used due to its extremely high Q[12], large thermal conductivity and small
thermal expansion coeﬃcient at cryogenic temperature. These characteristics
drastically reduce the eﬀects of thermal Brownian noise, thermal lensing and
thermo-elastic noise[13]. However, concerns have been raised about possible
large optical losses in sapphire, which would lead to increased thermal lens-
ing. Room temperature measurements of optical absorption in sapphire re-
ported by several groups exhibit a wide spread of values from 3 ppm/cm to
140 ppm/cm, even where measurements were made on the same sample[14,15].
In these measurements, the photothermal technique[16,17] was used, which is
an indirect method.

As a fundamental study towards the development of LCGT, we measured the
optical absorption coeﬃcient in sapphire at cryogenic temperature using laser
calorimetry[16,18]. Laser calorimetry at cryogenic temperatures has merit as
a measurement method;

(1) Since it is a direct measurement, it doesn’t rely on detailed knowledge
of other material parameters such as speciﬁc heat, thermal conductivity
and temperature coeﬃcient of refractive index.

(2) Since the thermal radiation from samples is very small at cryogenic tem-
perature, small absorbed laser power makes a relatively large temperature
increase, easily measured to high precision.

(3) Since the temperature in the cryostat is very stable, this measurement

technique is very insensitive to changes in the surroundings.

(4) Highly sensitive thermometers are available for the measurement of cryo-
genic temperatures. Carbon-Glass Resistance (CGR) thermometers were
used in this measurement, which have an accuracy of better than 1 mK
near liquid helium temperatures.

Rc: Contact resistance between the sample and the aluminum wire, RAl: Thermal
resistance of the aluminum wire. RAl was chosen to be much larger than Rs and
Rc.

Changes are measured in the steady state temperature of the sample for vary-
ing incident laser powers, after cooling the sapphire sample to liquid helium
temperature using thermal conduction through an aluminum wire. In short,
this measurement is equivalent to measuring the thermal resistance of the alu-
minum wire. Figure 1 shows the equivalent circuit of this measurement. Since
the thermal resistance in the sapphire sample is much smaller than one of
the aluminum wire, we can ignore the distribution of temperature within the
sample. We can formulate a thermal equation for the steady state temperature
T (x) in the aluminum wire and the two corresponding boundary conditions
as follows:

dx2 = 0,
T (0) = T0,

κ

S = P,

where κ is the thermal conductivity of the aluminum wire, T0 is the tem-
perature of the end of the aluminum wire connected to the helium reservoir
(equivalent to the initial temperature of the sample), L is the length of the
aluminum wire, S is the cross sectional area of the aluminum wire, and P

3

is the input heat power into the sample, which is equivalent to the absorbed
laser power. The origin of the x-axis was chosen at the end of the aluminum
wire. Generally, thermal conductivity κ depends on temperature, however we
can assume it to be constant because the change of the sample temperature
is at largest 100 mK. The error caused by this assumption is at most a few
percent. Integrating the above equations, the steady state temperature at the
sample T (L) can be written as,

(4)

(5)

(6)

T (L) = RAl · P + T0,
RAl ≡ L
κS

.

The steady state temperature at the sample is proportional to the input power.
The thermal resistance RAl was determined using a heater that produces
known heat power. Other errors concerning heat ﬂux are also canceled by
calibrating in this way. After calibration, we can obtain the optical absorption
coeﬃcient α,

α =

where Pabs is the laser power absorbed in the sample, Plas is the laser power
injected into the sample and l is the length of the sample.

Figure 2 shows the experimental setup. A 1.064 µm Nd:YAG laser was used
in this measurement. This laser has 700 mW output power with a power sta-
bility of 0.1 %. Injected laser power was measured by a power meter with an
accuracy of 3 % and net laser power in the sample was calculated consider-
ing multi-reﬂection within the sample[19]. The sapphire sample was held in a
pure aluminum mounting, itself mounted on Teﬂon rods. An aluminum wire
was tightened between the holder and the sample in a crush joint, and ther-
mally connected to the helium reservoir. A CGR thermometer and a manganin
heater were mounted in the holder. The thermometer and heater wires were
both manganin and superconducting. The diameter and length were optimized
to be able to ignore both the production and the conduction of heat. We could
measure a small thermal contact resistance between the sample and the alu-
minum holder, and we corrected for this after post-experiment measurement
of the crushed area of the aluminum wire. Since some reports mention that the
sensitivity of laser calorimetry is limited by the heat produced by light scat-
tered from the sample to the thermometer[16], we suspended another CGR
thermometer as a scattering monitor near the sample to further investigate.

3 Result

We measured two mono-crystalline sapphire samples, both manufactured by
Crystal Systems Inc. using the Heat Exchange Method[20]. The grades of these
samples were speciﬁed as ”CSI white high purity” and ”Hemlite”, respectively.
These sapphire grades are characterized by the homogeneity of refractive in-
dex. Typical homogeneity of the refractive index for CSI white is 1 × 10−6 and
that for Hemlite is 3 × 10−6[20]. The CSI white sample was 10 mm in diameter
and 150 mm in length (cylinder axis was parallel to the c-axis). The Hemlite
sample was 100 mm in diameter and 60 mm in thickness (again parallel to the
c-axis). All surfaces of the samples were optically polished. Though these sam-
ples had been annealed during the process of crystal growth, they were not
re-annealed after polishing. We measured at three spatially diﬀerent points on
each sample to conﬁrm that our measurement was not aﬀected by the heat
produced by surface dust or defects, and to examine whether there was any
inhomogeneity of absorption. Measurements were repeated more at least twice
at each point. The samples were cooled to 5 K and the temperature rise due to
absorption of laser power was at most 100 mK. Figure 3 shows the steady state
temperature at the ﬁrst measurement point in the CSI white sample. Mea-
surements were done twice at this point. The error bars were derived from the
maximum ﬂuctuation of electrical output from the thermometer, which was ±

temperature of these two measurements was caused by a change of a depth
of liquid helium in the reservoir, however this drift is much slower than the
measurement time of absorption. We are only interested in the derivatives,
which are then compared to the calibration made using the heater.

Table 1 shows the measured optical absorption coeﬃcient at each point. The
optical absorption coeﬃcients in the CSI white sample ranged from 88 ppm/cm
to 93 ppm/cm. The optical absorption coeﬃcients in the Hemlite sample ranged
from 90 ppm/cm to 99 ppm/cm. The errors were about ± 10 ppm/cm for all
measurements. No heat production by light scattering from the sample was
observed at the scattering monitor (CGR). We did not ﬁnd a large diﬀerence
in the optical absorption between our cryogenic result and a previous report
at room temperature[15].

4 Conclusion

We measured optical absorption in two sapphire samples, which were man-
ufactured by Crystal Systems Inc., at 1.064 µm wavelength at 5 K, using a

6

700 mW laser. The optical absorption coeﬃcients for the CSI white sample
ranged from 88 ppm/cm to 93 ppm/cm. The optical absorption coeﬃcients for
the Hemlite sample ranged from 90 ppm/cm to 99 ppm/cm. In both samples,
the measurement errors were about ± 10 ppm/cm.

The requirements for the total optical loss for LCGT, including the optical
absorption, surface scattering[21,22] and Rayleigh scattering[23], is less than
300 ppm. When we take the length of the proposed mirror to be 100 mm, the
optical absorption in the currently available sapphire is too large to achieve
this requirement. The optical absorption in sapphire must be reduced by least
three times from the present value.

The sources of the optical absorption are suspected to be impurities or lattice
defects. We have conﬁrmed the presence of Ti3+, Cr3+ and other unidenti-
ﬁed impurities in these samples. However, we have not yet identiﬁed the true
sources of optical absorption at 1.064 µm. This problem will be addressed in
a future study.

The cryogenic measurement of optical absorption established in this study can
be used in the development of optical components for the advanced interfero-
metric gravitational wave detectors.

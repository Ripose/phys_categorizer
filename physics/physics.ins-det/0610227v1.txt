Abstract

New calibrations of CR39 and Makrofol nuclear track detectors have been obtained using 158 A GeV
P b82+ and In49+ ions; a new method for the bulk etch rate determination, using both cone height and
base diameter measurements was developed. The CR39 charge resolution based on the etch-pit base area
measurement is adequate to identify nuclear fragments in the interval 7 ≤ Z/β ≤ 49. For CR39 the detection
threshold is at REL ∼ 50 MeV cm2 g−1, corresponding to a nuclear fragment with Z/β ∼ 7. Base cone
area distributions for Makrofol foils exposed to P b82+ ions have shown for the ﬁrst time all peaks due to
nuclear fragments with Z > 50; the distribution of the etched cone heights shows well separated individual
peaks for Z/β = 78 ÷ 83 (charge pickup). The Makrofol detection threshold is at REL ∼ 2700 MeV cm2
g−1, corresponding to a nuclear fragment with Z/β ∼ 50.

1 Introduction

Nuclear Track Detectors (NTDs) are employed in several scientiﬁc and technological
applications [1,2]. The most sensitive NTD is the isotropic poly-allyl-diglycol carbonate
r(cid:13) polycarbonates are also
polymer, commercially known as CR39
largely employed. More than 4000 m2 of CR39 detectors were used in the MACRO and
SLIM experiments devoted to the search for new massive particles in the cosmic radiation
(magnetic monopoles, nuclearites, q-balls) [3,6]. Several experiments are going on in diﬀerent
ﬁelds which require an accurate detector calibration [7-8].

r(cid:13); Makrofol

r(cid:13)/Lexan

The damaged trail (called “latent track”) produced by an ionizing particle can be made
visible with an optical microscope through a chemical etching process in aqueous solution of
either NaOH or KOH at a proper concentration and temperature. The latent track develops
into a conical-shaped etch-pit, when the etching velocity along the particle trajectory (vT )
is larger than the one for the bulk etching of the material ( vB), Fig. 1 [1]. The addition of
ethyl alcohol in the etchant speeds up the etching process, improves the post-etched surface
quality of CR39 and Makrofol, but raises their detection thresholds.

For particles with constant energy loss, the etch-rate ratio p = vT /vB, may be determined
by measuring either the etch-pit surface area or the etch-pit height and the bulk etch rate,
vB. Two methods have been used to determine vB: the most common one is based on the

1

measurement of the detector thickness removed during etching. The method is aﬀected by
a systematic error of a few % [9].

The main aim of this paper is to analyze a new method of measurement of the bulk-etch

rate in CR39 and in Makrofol, and to obtain new calibrations for these detectors.

2 Experimental

A stack composed of Makrofol and CR39 foils of size 11.5 x 11.5 cm2 with a 1 cm thick
lead target was exposed to 158 A GeV P b82+ ions in 1996 (Pb96); a second stack with a
1 cm thick aluminium target was exposed to 158 A GeV In49+ ions in 2003 (In03); both
exposures were performed at the CERN-SPS, at normal incidence and a total ion density of
∼ 2000/cm2. The CR39 polymer sheets used in the present experiment were manufactured
by Intercast Europe Co., Parma, Italy using a specially designed line of production [10]. The
Makrofol detectors were manufactured by Bayer A.G., Germany. The Makrofol thickness is
500 µm, the CR39 thickness is either 700 µm or 1400 µm; all detector sheets were covered
by a 30 µm plastic ﬁlm to protect them from exposure to ambient radon; the protective
layers were removed before etching. The detector foils downstream of the target recorded
the beam ions as well as their nuclear fragments.

After exposures, two CR39 foils (In03 stack) and two Makrofol foils, (Pb96 stack), located
after the target were etched in 6 N NaOH + 1% ethyl alcohol at 70 ◦C for 40 h and 6 N
KOH + 20 % ethyl alcohol at 50 ◦C for 8 h, respectively. The etching was performed in
a stainless steel tank equipped with internal thermo-resistances and a motorized stirring
head. The temperature was stable to within ±0.1 ◦C. In order to keep homogeneous the
solution and to avoid that etched products deposit on the detector surfaces, a continuous
stirring was applied during etching.

For CR39 detectors, etch-pit base diameters and heights of In ions and their fragments
were measured with a Leica optical microscope.
In Makrofol, Pb ions and their high Z
fragments made through-holes in the detector sheets; thus the cone length Le was measured
only for high Z fragment tracks that have sharp etch-cone tips (no holes). Nuclear fragments
with charges 78 ≤ Z ≤ 82 were identiﬁed by etching another Makrofol sheet from the same
stack in the same conditions for only 5 hours.

2.1 “Standard” measurement of vB

As already recalled, the standard determination of vB is based on the measurement of the
thickness of the detector at diﬀerent etching times. The thickness is measured with an
electronic micrometer of 1 µm accuracy in 25 positions on the detector foil. The average
bulk-etch velocity is vB = ∆x/2∆t, where ∆x is the mean thickness diﬀerence after a ∆t
etching time. For CR39, at etching times shorter than 10 hours the thickness is aﬀected by
detector swelling [11-13]. The bulk etching rate must be determined by a linear ﬁt of ∆x vs
∆t for etching times longer than 10 hours. For Makrofol no signiﬁcant swelling eﬀect was
observed.

2.2 The bulk etch rate from the cone height and base diameter measurements

For relativistic charged particles the track etch rate vT can be considered constant. For
normally incident particles, the measurable quantities are the cone base diameter D, and
the height Le, see Fig. 1. Le is obtained by multiplying the measured cone height by the

2

refractive index n of the etched detector material; n is obtained from the ratio of the actual
thickness (measured with an electronic micrometer with a precision of 1 µm) to the apparent
thickness measured with an optical microscope (precision of 1 µm) [nCR39 = 1.55 ± 0.01;
nM akrof ol = 1.69 ± 0.01].

The following relations hold:

Le = (vT − vB)t

D = 2vBt

(vT − vB)
(vT + vB)

From the above relations, the following quadratic equation in vB is obtained

We may thus determine the bulk etch rate vB and the reduced etch-rate p by measuring
the track parameters Le (measured with a precision of ∼ 1 µm) and D (precision of 0.5
µm).

Relations (4-6) were tested with relativistic Pb and In ions and their nuclear fragments.
We selected only tracks for which precise measurements of the cone height and diameter
could be performed (for example we cannot measure precisely the track cone heights for
low Z fragments). Then, using equation (4) we computed the bulk-etch rate for CR39 and
Makrofol. Batches of measurements were made by diﬀerent operators, and the average vB’s
and their statistical standard deviations were computed, see Table 1. By this method we
obtain vB values with accuracies of ± 0.01 - 0.05 µm/h. The vB values obtained for the
same foils using detector thickness measurements are also given.

Notice that we can eﬀectively make measurements with the available measuring
instruments using the new method only for intermediate z-values because at low and high
z we do not have enough precision for measuring Le and D, respectively.

3 Calibrations

In ref. [14] it was shown that the reduced etch rate p of CR39 is a unique function of the
particle Restricted Energy Loss (REL). In the following sections new calibration data are
reported for CR39 and Makrofol based on the new determination of the bulk etch rate.

3.1 Calibration of the CR39 detector

Etch-pit base areas were measured with the Elbek automatic image analyzer system [15].
Fig. 2 shows the etch-pit base area distribution for Indium ions and their fragments in CR39;
averages were computed from measurements made on the ”front sides” of two detector
sheets. The peaks are well separated from Z/β ∼ 7 to 45; the charge resolution for the
average of two measurements is σZ ∼ 0.13e at Z/β ∼ 15. The charge resolution close to
the Indium peak (Z ∼ 49) can be improved by measuring the heights of the etch pit cones
[16]. The heights of 1000 etch-cones with diameter larger than 48 µm (corresponding to
nuclear fragments with Z > 45) were measured with an accuracy of ±1 µm with a Leica
microscope coupled to a CCD camera and a video monitor. The corresponding distribution
is shown in the inset in Fig. 2; each of the 4 peaks is well separated from the others, and a
charge can be assigned to each one.

The charge resolution for single measurements of diﬀerent nuclear fragments is given in
Table 2; it is σZ ∼ 0.22e at Z/β ∼ 48. The charge resolutions may be computed using the
relations [17]

σZ =

σA
δA/δZ

, σZ =

σLe
δLe/δZ

(7)

where σA and σLe are the standard deviations; A is the mean base area and Le the mean

height of the etched cones.

3.2 Calibration of the Makrofol detector

Fig. 3 shows the base area distribution for the average of 2 measurements of Pb ions and
their fragments in Makrofol; averages were computed from measurements on the front sides
of two detector foils. The peaks are well separated from Z/β = 51 to ∼ 77 (the charge
resolution is σZ ∼ 0.18e at Z/β ∼ 55. The charge resolution close to the Pb peak (Z = 82)
was improved by measuring the heights of the etch pit cones. The heights of 4000 etch cones
with base diameters larger than 47 µm were measured; the corresponding distribution is
shown in the inset in Fig. 3; each peak is well separated from the others, and a charge was
assigned to every peak. The charge resolution for single measurements of diﬀerent nuclear
fragments is σZ ∼ 0.18e at Z/β ∼ 81, see Table 2). Notice the presence of the Z = 83 peak
from a charge pick-up reaction.

For each detected nuclear fragment from Z = 7 to 48 and Indium ions (Z = 49) we
computed the REL and the reduced etch rate p = vT /vB using eq. (6). p versus REL for
CR39 is plotted in Fig. 4; the CR39 detection threshold is at REL ∼ 50 MeV cm2 g−1
(corresponding to a relativistic nuclear fragment with Z ∼ 7.

The same procedure was applied to Makrofol (Fig. 5). The Makrofol detection threshold

is at REL ∼ 2700 MeV cm2 g−1, corresponding to a nuclear fragment with Z/β ∼ 50.

As evident in Figs. 4 and 5 the reduced etch-rate p is a non-linear function of REL. For
example for CR39 up to REL ∼ 500 MeV cm2 g−1, p changes slowly with REL, while a
rapid increase is observed at larger values.

The changes δD and δLe with respect to δp can be obtained by diﬀerentiating eqs. 1 and

2 with respect to p [18]:

(9)

At large p values, δD/δp is smaller with respect to δLe/δp; for high REL it is diﬃcult to
obtain a charge resolution < 1e. From Figs. 2 and 3 it is seen that for high Z/β, the base
area distribution does not give well separated peaks, while by cone height measurements
the peaks are well separated (see the insets).

4 Discussion and Conclusions

The ”new method” for measuring the bulk etch rate for intermediate or high z values yields
slightly smaller uncertainties than the ”standard method” (change in thickness). This comes
from the use at the same time of both cone heights and base diameter measurements of
tracks.

The values obtained here by the two methods are in reasonable agreement; the diﬀerences
may arise from small systematic uncertainties aﬀecting the thickness measurement of a sheet
and the cone height and diameter of etch-pits.

Calibration data were obtained with In49+ ions of 158 A GeV for CR39 and with P b82+
ions of 158 A GeV for the Makrofol detectors. Well separated peaks for the primary ions
and for their fragments are observed in Figs. 2 and 3. At low Z/β the measurements of
the base area cones are adequate, while at high Z/β the measurements of the cone heights
are more useful. All the peaks are well separated in CR39 (In03) for Z/β ∼ 7 - 49 and in
Makrofol (Pb96) for Z/β ∼ 52 - 83; a charge value may be assigned to each peak (for these
exposures β ∼ 1).

The reduced etch rate p (computed with the new method) plotted versus REL covers a

large Z/β range for both detectors, Fig. 4 and 5.

Abstract

The physics motivations and the detector design of the long baseline OPERA experiment are discussed;
OPERA is a hybrid detector made of several types of electronic subdetectors, 2 magnets and lead/nuclear
emulsions “brick” walls. It is located in the Gran Sasso underground lab, 732 km from CERN, on the CNGS
neutrino beam. A summary of the performances and of the physics plans are presented.

1 Introduction

Neutrino physics has opened new windows into phenomena beyond the Standard Model of
particle physics. Long baseline neutrino experiments may allow further insight into neutrino
physics. The CERN to Gran Sasso neutrino beam (CNGS) is one of these projects [1], and
ντ oscillations
one of the main experiments is OPERA [2], designed to search for the νµ ←→
in the parameter region indicated by the MACRO [3], SuperKamiokande [4] and Soudan2
[5] atmospheric neutrino results [6], recently conﬁrmed by the K2K [7] and MINOS [8]
experiments. The main goal of OPERA is to ﬁnd the ντ appearance by direct detection of
νe
the τ lepton from ντ CC interactions. One may also search for the subleading νµ ←→
oscillations and make a variety of observations with or without the beam using the electronic
subdetectors.

The τ decays can be classiﬁed as muonic (BR 18%), electronic (BR 18%) and hadronic (BR
1 µm is necessary; this resolution is
64%). To observe the decays, a spatial resolution of
obtained in emulsion sheets interspersed with thin lead target plates. This technique, the
Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC), was started in the τ search experiment [9].

The basic target module is a “brick”, consisting of a sequence of 56 lead plates (1 mm
12.7 cm2, a depth of 7.5 cm (10
thick) and 57 emulsion layers. A brick has a size of 10.2
radiation lengths) and a weight of 8.3 kg. Two additional emulsion sheets, the changeable
sheets, are glued on its downstream face. The bricks are arranged in walls. Within a brick,
the achieved spatial resolution is < 1 µm and the angular resolution is 2 mrad. These values
allow the reconstruction of the ν interaction vertex and of the τ decay topology. To provide
a ν interaction trigger and to identify the brick in which the interaction took place, the
brick walls are complemented by a target tracker and a muon spectrometer. The target
tracker consists of highly segmented scintillator planes inserted between the brick walls; the
magnetic spectrometer measures the muon momentum and identiﬁes the sign of the charges.
Combining the signals left in the electronic detectors, the brick containing the ν interaction
vertex can be determined with a global eﬃciency of
9%. The brick is extracted and
its changeable sheets are developed and scanned using fast automatic microscopes. If the
presence of tracks from an interaction is conﬁrmed, all the emulsion sheets of the brick are
developed and sent to the scanning labs for further analysis.

2 The CNGS neutrino beam

Fig. 1 shows the main components of the νµ beam at CERN [1]. The CNGS beam is
optimised for a maximum number of CC ντ interactions at Gran Sasso (732 km from CERN).
The energy distribution at Gran Sasso is shown in Fig. 2: the primary p energy is 400 GeV,
the mean νµ beam energy is 17 GeV, the ¯νµ contamination is
2%, the νe ( ¯νe) is < 1% and
the number of ντ is negligible. The L/Eν ratio is 43 km/GeV. Civil engineering is completed,
all beam parts are installed and commissioning is being made; the ﬁrst low intensity beam
is expected at GS in August 2006.

3 The OPERA detector

The OPERA detector, Fig. 3, is made of two identical super-modules, each consisting of a
target section with 31 target planes followed by a muon spectrometer. With 206000 bricks,
the initial target mass is 1.8 kt.

Electronic subdetectors. The ﬁrst subdetector is an anticoincidence wall to better

separate muon events coming from interactions in OPERA and in the material before.
The target tracker is made of 32000 scintillator strips, each 7 m long and of 25 mm
15
mm cross section (7000 m2 area). Along the strip, a wavelength shifting ﬁbre of 1 mm
diameter transmits the light signals to both ends. The readout is done by 1000 64 channel
HAMAMATSU PMTs. The target of the ﬁrst super-module was installed in November
2005, the second in June 2006. A brick wall position accuracy is better than 1 mm.

×

The muon spectrometer consists of 2 iron magnets instrumented with Resistive Plate
8 m2 dipole with a ﬁeld of 1.55 T
Chambers (RPC) and drift tubes. Each magnet is an 8
in the upward direction on one side and in the downward direction on the other side. This
allows to measure the momentum twice, reducing the error by √2. A magnet consists of
twelve 5 cm thick iron slabs, alternated with RPC planes. In the magnetic ﬁeld a muon is
tracked, identiﬁed and its momentum is measured.

The precision tracker [10] measures the muon track coordinates in the horizontal plane.

It is made of 12 drift tube planes, each covering an area of 8
and behind each magnet and between the two magnets. Each drift tube is 8 m long and has
an outer diameter of 38 mm. The eﬃciency of the muon identiﬁcation, the accuracy of the
momentum measurement and sign determination are increased; the charge misidentiﬁcation
0.3%. This minimises the background from charmed particles produced in
should be 0.1
νµ interactions. The muon spectrometer allows a momentum resolution ∆p/p
0.25 for
muon momenta < 25 GeV/c. To reduce the number of “ghost tracks” two planes of glass
RPC’s (XPC’s), consisting of two 45◦ crossed planes, are installed in front of the magnets.
The construction status in July 2006 is shown in Fig. 4. The brick supporting structure,
the tracker planes, the XPC’s and three of the high precision tracker planes of the ﬁrst
supermodule are installed. The magnets, including all RPC’s and the mechanical structure
are completed.

consisting of 1200 nodes. To match the data of the diﬀerent subdetectors an event time
stamp is delivered by a clock using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The DAQ uses
a system which contains the CPU, the memory, the clock receiver for the time stamp and
the ethernet connections to the other components. The components of the DAQ system are
under test.

The commissioning of each subdetector is underway. The ﬁnal commissioning will be

made with the CNGS at reduced intensity in August 2006.

Nuclear emulsions and their scanning. The production of the bricks is made by
the Brick Assembling Machine (BAM). It consists of robots for the mechanical packing of
the bricks. In total 23 million lead and emulsion layers are needed to make the bricks. The
2 bricks
ﬁnal system is now installed in the Gran Sasso lab and its production speed is
per minute.

∼

The bricks are handled by the Brick Manipulator System (BMS), made of two robots,
each operating at one side of the detector; one robot consists of a drum for brick transfer
and a brick storage carousel. An arm is used to insert the bricks. The extraction of a brick,
in the region indicated by the electronic detectors, is done by a vacuum sucker. The ﬁrst
BMS robot was installed in 2005 and the whole system is now being commissioned.

A fast automated scanning system is needed to cope with the daily analysis of a large
20 cm2/h per
number of emulsion sheets. The minimum required scanning speed is
emulsion layer (44 µm thick). It corresponds to an increase in speed of at least one order of
magnitude with respect to past systems [11, 12]. For this purpose OPERA developed the
European Scanning System (ESS) [13] and the S-UTS in Japan [14].

∼

The main components of the ESS microscope are shown in Fig. 5 left: (i) a high quality,
rigid and vibration-free support table; (ii) a motor driven scanning stage for horizontal (XY)
motion; (iii) a granite arm; (iv) a motor driven stage mounted vertically (Z) on the granite
arm for focusing; (v) optics; (vi) digital camera for image grabbing mounted on the vertical
stage and connected with a vision processor; (vii) an illumination system located below the
scanning table. The emulsion sheet is placed on a glass plate (emulsion holder) and its
ﬂatness is guaranteed by a vacuum system.

By adjusting the focal plane of the objective, the 44 µm emulsion thickness is spanned

and 16 tomographic images of each ﬁeld of view, taken at equally spaced depth levels, are
obtained. The images are digitized, converted into a grey scale of 256 levels, sent to a
vision processor board and analyzed to recognize sequences of aligned grains. Some of these
are track grains; others are spurious grains (fog) not associated to particle tracks. The
three-dimensional structure of a track in an emulsion layer (microtrack) is reconstructed by
combining clusters belonging to images at diﬀerent levels. Each microtrack pair is connected
across the plastic base to form the base track. A set of base tracks forms a volume track. The
ESS is based on the use of commercial hardware components. The software used for data
taking and track reconstruction has a modular structure, providing the ﬂexibility needed to
upgrade the system following the technological progress.

The Japanese S-UTS system, Fig. 5 right, is based on hardware designed and made in

Nagoya; the software system is mounted in specially designed electronic boards.

4 Physics performances. Conclusions

The detection eﬃciency of tau decays was studied by MonteCarlo simulations. One
distinguishes two cases: (i) “short” decays: the tau decays in the same lead plate where it is
produced; the signature is a non-zero impact parameter of the decay products with respect
to the primary vertex, which can be determined for multi-prong deep inelastic scatterings
(DIS), Fig. 6. (ii) “long” decays: the tau is measured directly and the kink angle of the
charged decays accurately determined for DIS and quasi elastic (QE) neutrino interactions.
The ﬁrst run is scheduled for the second half of 2006. After the commissioning of the
CNGS beam and of the OPERA electronic detectors with a low intensity beam, there will
be a normal intensity run.

The interactions in the bricks allow to check the analysis procedure, the vertex ﬁnding
eﬃciencies and the beam induced background. The expected number of τ events, for a beam

by
30% and that the beam may be increased by a factor of 1.5. One should be able to
achieve the discovery potential in few years.

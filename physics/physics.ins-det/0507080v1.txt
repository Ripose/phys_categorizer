Abstract

The TOTEM collaboration has developed and tested the
ﬁrst prototype of its Roman Pots to be operated in the LHC.
TOTEM Roman Pots contain stacks of silicon detectors
with strips oriented in two orthogonal directions. To mea-
sure proton scattering angles of a few microradians, the
detectors will approach the beam centre to a distance of
10 σ + 0.5 mm (= 1.3 mm). Dead space near the detector
edge is minimised by using two novel “edgeless” detec-
tor technologies. The silicon detectors are used both for
precise track reconstruction and for triggering. The ﬁrst
full-sized prototypes of both detector technologies as well
as their read-out electronics have been developed, built and
operated. The tests took place in the proton beam-line of
the SPS accelerator ring. In addition, the pot’s shielding
against electromagnetic interference and the longitudinal
beam coupling impedance have been measured with the
wire method.

ROMAN POTS FOR THE TOTEM
EXPERIMENT AT LHC

The LHC experiment TOTEM [1] is designed for mea-
suring the elastic pp scattering cross-section, the total pp
cross-section and diffractive processes. These physics ob-
jectives require the detection of leading protons with scat-
tering angles of a few µrad, which is accomplished with
a Roman Pot (“RP”) system having stations at 147 m and
220 m from the interaction point 5 where CMS will be lo-
cated. Each station is composed of two RP units separated
by 2.5 – 4 m depending on beam equipment integration
constraints. Each RP unit consists of a vacuum chamber
equipped with two vertical insertions (top and bottom) and
a horizontal one. Each insertion (“pot”) contains a package
of 10 silicon detectors in a secondary vacuum. The pots can
be moved into the primary vacuum of the machine through
vacuum bellows. In order to minimize the distance of the
detectors from the beam, and to minimize multiple scatter-
ing, the wall thickness of the pot is locally reduced to a thin
window foil (140 – 210 µm).

The low impedance budget of the LHC machine (broad-
band longitudinal impedance limit Z/n ≈ 0.1 Ω) imposes
a tight limit on the RPs’ beam coupling impedance. Be-
cause of the beam’s bunch structure and its high inten-
sity, the pick-up noise on the detector electronics caused by
electromagnetic leakage is a potential concern and needs to
be studied and minimised.

THE ROMAN POT PROTOTYPE IN THE
SPS BEAM

During the summer 2004 the TOTEM collaboration has
performed tests on a prototype unit made of 2 vertical RPs.
The unit has been installed in the LSS5 section of the SPS
accelerator at CERN. The motors moving the pots towards
the beam, the electronics of the detectors and the cooling
system stabilising the temperature of the detectors inside
the pots were operated remotely from a temporary control
room in a surface building. The upper and lower pots con-
tained each a set of 8 silicon strip detectors with 66 µm
pitch, built in two novel technologies allowing for efﬁ-
ciency up to the physical edge [1]. Six of them were read
out with analogue APV25 chips and 2 with digital VFAT
chips delivering the fast-or signal of all 512 strips. The lat-
ter were used for triggering the data acquisition system in
coincidence with the sum signal of the four pick-up elec-
trodes of a beam position monitor.

In the retracted pot position the thin windows were
40 mm away from the beam pipe axis. To watch the effect
of the RPs’ movements on the beam quality, three beam
loss monitors (BLMs) have been installed near the unit:
one at 56 cm upstream on the top of the beam pipe and
two at 65 cm downstream, one on the top and one on the
bottom of the pipe. The BLMs used were cylindrical ioni-
sation chambers ﬁlled with air.

TOTEM was the SPS main user during 2 shifts of 8 hours
with dedicated coasting beam. Three bunch structures were
tested: 1 single bunch in the ring, 4 bunches equally spaced,
and 4 equally spaced trains of 4 bunches.

Detector data were taken with the two pots positioned in-
dependently between 6 mm and 14 mm (σbeam ≈ 0.8 mm)

from the beam pipe centre. Because of contact problems
with the Kapton connections between the individual detec-
tor/chip hybrids and the central electronics board of each
pot, 4 out of the 16 detectors could not be read out. The
high redundancy in the system’s design however allowed
us to carry out the experiment as planned.

The observed variation of the rate with the distance is not
big because all measurements were made more than 8 σ
from the beam centre where the halo is rather ﬂat.

The response of the tracking silicon detectors conforms
to expectations. Figure 3 shows the halo proﬁles measured
by detector planes with orthogonal strips.

Figure 1 shows the scraping of the beam periphery by the
pot as measured with the BLMs. The downstream monitors
show spikes whenever one of the pots approaches the pipe
centre closer than 10 mm (= 12.5 σ). As expected, the up-
stream BLM remains largely quiet, except when the bottom
pot moves closer than 8 σ, which creates an increased halo
travelling around the ring. The general trend of increasing
beam losses is caused by a slow beam growth as its quality
deteriorates.

Attenuation of Electric and Magnetic Fields by
the Roman Pot Window

The trigger rates measured in the top pot for different
distances are shown in Figure 2. Given the SPS revolution
period of 23 µs, the trigger probability varies between one
trigger per 11 bunches at d = 7 mm and one trigger per
18 bunches at d = 14 mm. The latter distance corresponds
to 17 σ, as also foreseen for the LHC at the 220 m station.

To determine the attenuation of electromagnetic ﬁelds by
the RP’s windows, the silicon detectors were replaced with
antenna insertions (Figure 4). A network analyser mea-
sured the transmission from one end of the RP (Port A)
to each of the antenna outputs (Ports 1 to 4) for frequen-
cies up to 200 MHz. The other end of the RP (Port B) was

terminated with 50 Ω. The transmitted signal was ampli-
ﬁed by 30 dB. The top and bottom insertions had 210 µm
and 140 µm thick windows respectively. To measure the
pure signal coupling between the wire and the antennas,
comparison measurements without any window have been
made. The results for a distance of 2 mm are shown in Fig-
ure 5. The transmitted electric ﬁeld is mostly smaller than
the noise level of the measurement setup. Figure 6 shows
the transmission from the wire to the antennas at the LHC
bunch frequency 40 MHz as a function of the pot distance
from the wire. The attenuation of the magnetic ﬁeld by the
140 µm and 210 µm thick pot windows amounts to 60 dB
and 70 dB respectively. The electric ﬁeld is attenuated by at
least 70 dB. The inﬂuence of bunch-generated ﬁelds on de-
tectors and electronics remains to be measured in the future
with a spark generator.

The Longitudinal Beam Coupling Impedance

To determine the longitudinal beam coupling impedance
Z, the complex transmission coefﬁcient S21 between Ports
A and B (Figure 4) was measured with a network analyser.
Then Z was calculated from S21(f, d) with the RP at a
distance d, and a reference measurement Sref
21 (f ) with the
RP in retracted position. The “improved log formula” pro-
posed by Shaposhnikova and Jensen [2]

was used, where ZC = 294 Ω is the characteristic
impedance of the unperturbed beam pipe, l = 11 cm is the
length of the perturbation (i.e. the diameter of the pot in-
sertions), and f is the frequency. The dash-dotted line in
Figure 7 shows the real part of Z for d = 2 mm with the
original conﬁguration of the RP. The dependence on d is
given in Figure 8 for the two main resonances. The approx-
imately Gaussian LHC bunch structure with σt = 0.25 ns
leads to a Gaussian envelope with σf = 0.63 GHz in
the frequency distribution of the LHC current with har-
monics every 40 MHz. Hence the relevant resonances
lie well below 1 GHz. The dominant line at 740 MHz
has an impedance of 1.2 kΩ which yields an uncomfort-
ably high Z/n = 18 mΩ where n = freson/fLHC =
740 MHz/11 kHz. After installation of little pieces of fer-
rite into the cavity around the RP insertion, this impedance
is damped by a factor 5, demonstrating the effectiveness
of the ferrite approach. For the ﬁnal RP the geometrical
ferrite arrangement will be optimised to further reduce the
impedance.

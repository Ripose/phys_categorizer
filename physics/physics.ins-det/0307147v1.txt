Abstract

Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers will constitute the large majority
of precision detectors in the Muon Spectrometer of the ATLAS experiment
at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. For commissioning and calibration
of MDT chambers, a Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility is in operation at
Munich University. The objectives of this facility are to test the chambers
and on-chamber electronics, to map the positions of the anode wires within
the chambers with the precision needed for standalone muon momentum mea-
surement in ATLAS, and to gain experience in the operation of the chambers
and on-line calibration procedures.

Until the start of muon chamber installation in ATLAS, 88 chambers built
at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich have to be commissioned
and calibrated. With a data taking period of one day individual wire positions
can be measured with an accuracy of 8.3 µm in the chamber plane and 27 µm
in the direction perpendicular to that plane.

Introduction

The large majority of the precision detectors of the muon spectrometer of the AT-
LAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be Monitored Drift Tube
(MDT) chambers. These chambers consist of 2 multilayers, each built of 3 or 4
layers of densely packed drift tubes mounted on a support frame made of aluminum
(compare ﬁgure 1). The drift tubes — which are also made of aluminum — have
an outer diameter of 3 cm and a wall thickness of 400 µm; in the middle of each
tube a gold-plated W-Re anode wire of 50 µm diameter is stretched. The anode
wire is positioned only at the two tube ends by precision end-plugs; the sag of each
chamber can be adjusted to follow the sag of the wire along the tube. The drift
tubes are operated at a pressure of 3 bar absolute with an Ar:CO2=93:7 gas mixture
at a gas gain of 2 × 104. The area covered by a complete chamber ranges from 1 m2
to 11 m2. A total of 1194 MDT chambers will be used in ATLAS [1].

In collaboration with the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Physics, Munich Uni-
versity (LMU) is responsible for the construction of 88 MDT chambers of type BOS
(Barrel Outer Small — the second largest type used in the ATLAS barrel region)
which consists of 432 drift tubes, arranged in 2×3 layers of 72 tubes, and has a size1
of 3.9 m × 2.2 m × 0.5 m. The chambers are built with high mechanical precision at
MPI [2] and are then commissioned and calibrated at the Cosmic Ray Measurement
Facility of Munich University.

The main objectives of the Cosmic Ray Facility are to test the chambers, to
map the positions of the tube layers and of individual anode wires within the cham-
bers, and to gain experience in the operation of the chambers and the calibration
procedures.

An important design goal of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is the standalone
measurement capability of muon momenta up to 1 TeV with a relative error of less
than 10%. This leads to the requirement that the anode wire positions within the
MDT chambers must be known to within 20 µm [1].

The whole setup is located in a climatized hall to ensure stable environmental

conditions during the measurements. We deﬁne a right handed coordinate system,
the x coordinate in the direction along the wires, y perpendicular to the wires in
the chamber plane, and z perpendicular to the chamber plane pointing upwards.

Three MDT chambers are operated simultaneously in the facility. Two of them,
the so-called reference chambers, encompass the third chamber — which is to be
tested — and provide track information for cosmic ray muons. The anode wire
positions of the reference chambers have been mapped with a precision of 2 µm
with an X-ray tomograph at CERN [3].

A coincidence of the three scintillator layers in the hodoscopes above and below
the MDT chambers provides the trigger. The upper hodoscope consists of one
layer of scintillator counters, the lower of two staggered layers displaced by half the
width of a counter. Only muons with a momentum greater than 600 MeV pass the
34 cm iron absorber above the lower hodoscope and can generate a trigger signal.
The trigger logic is divided into 5 segments along the x coordinate to limit the
inclination of the muons in the x-z plane. The arrangement of the scintillator
bars allows the measurement of muon tracks in the x direction with a precision of
8 cm. The time of the muon transition is determined by the lower hodoscope with
a precision of better than 800 ps. The average trigger rate is about 70 Hz.

The streamer tubes at the bottom of the setup are used together with the lower
reference chamber to determine the multiple scattering angle in the y-z plane in the
iron absorber. This angle is used in combination with the angle between the track
segments in the two reference chambers to estimate the momentum of the muon.

Two contact free alignment systems are used to continuously monitor the po-
sitions of all MDT chambers: The position of the reference chambers relative to

2

each other is measured with an optical alignment system consisting of eight RasNik
sensors [4], the position of the test chamber with respect to the upper MDT cham-
ber with eight capacitive sensors [5]. Both systems have a precision of better than
5 µm [6].

In addition to the chamber-to-chamber alignment, the internal chamber geom-

etry is also monitored with integrated RasNik sensors (compare ﬁgure 1).

3 Drift Time Spectra

The position measurement in the MDT chambers is based on the measurement of the
drift time of the electrons (from ionization by the incident muon along its trajectory)
to the anode wire. The drift time is determined with respect to the external trigger
system and translated to the impact radius (distance from the anode wire) via the
so-called r-t relation (see section 4); the drift tubes are only sensitive to the track
coordinates in a plane perpendicular to the anode wire, not along it. The drift
of the electrons depends on the gas composition, the gas density, and the electric
ﬁeld applied (i.e. the operating voltage), and is therefore characteristic of the gas
mixture and the operating conditions.

After correcting for the signal propagation times along the anode wire and in the
electronics and cables, the distributions of drift times are used as a ﬁrst check that
each tube is functioning as expected and that the detector response is homogeneous.
For the simple case of uniform illumination of a tube, the density of hits at a given
drift time is proportional to the drift velocity at the corresponding radius.

Events with more than one charged particle passing through the setup would
lead to ambiguities in the hodoscope time measurement. Therefore, exactly one hit
in the upper hodoscope and one pair of hits in overlapping counters in the lower
hodoscope are demanded, which rejects 15 % of all triggers (see table 1).

The edges of the drift time spectra are parameterized [7] with the functions

F (t) = p0 +

for the rising edge and

(1)

G (t) = pm +

for the trailing edge of the spectrum,

(2)

A0

t0 −t
1 + e
T0
αmt + Am
t−tm
Tm

1 + e

as shown in ﬁgure 3. The parameters p0 and pm correspond to the rates of accidental
hits, A0 to the height of the spectrum, and t0 to the mid-time and T0 to the steepness
of the rising edge of the spectrum, which is determined by the resolution of the drift
tube near the anode wire. Correspondingly, tm is the middle of the trailing edge
of the spectrum and Tm its steepness, which is determined by the decrease in pulse
height near the tube wall2. The parameterization with αmt + Am accounts for the
slope of the spectrum before its trailing edge that is due to the decrease of the drift
velocity with increasing radius.

The maximum drift time, deﬁned as τ = (tm + Tm) − t0, is characteristic of the
drift properties of a tube. The distribution of the maximum drift time is shown
in ﬁgure 4a for the tubes of one MDT chamber. As part of the chamber quality
control programme, it is checked that all tubes have the same drift time spectrum
characteristics within errors, compare ﬁgure 4b.

2The small pulse height for muons passing a tube close to the tube wall is due to their short

path inside the tube, which leads to smaller primary ionization.

4 The Relation between Drift Time and Drift Ra-

dius

The relation between the measured drift time and the corresponding drift radius (r-t
relation) is determined without the help of external spacial detectors and without
assumptions on uniform tube illumination. After the check described in section 3,
it is assumed that all tubes of an MDT chamber have the same r-t relation.

Events with two hits at small drift times (|t − t0| < 15 ns) in one MDT chamber
are selected. By assuming that the muon went through the two corresponding
anode wires and that the trajectory of the muon is a straight line, the impact radii

in the other tubes of the chamber can be calculated. This procedure yields drift
times for a discrete set of drift radii. The number of such points — typically 16 —
is determined by the geometry of the chamber and the angular acceptance of the
trigger. In addition to these points, the drift times corresponding to r = 0 and to
the inner tube radius are determined by the ﬁt to the drift time spectra described in
section 3. The r-t relation is then approximated by a linear interpolation between
the measured values.

5 Track Reconstruction

Within each MDT chamber a muon track segment is reconstructed from the mea-
sured hits. A track segment is assumed to be a straight line in the y − z plane3:

where the index n speciﬁes the chamber. The parameters mn and bn are determined
for each chamber by minimizing the χ2 function

y(z) = mnz + bn,

,

χ2 =

X

(3)

(4)

where the index i runs over all tubes contributing to the track segment, rtrack, i is
the distance of the track segment to the wire, rdrif t, i is the measured drift radius,
and σi is the resolution of the tube for the given radius. At a test beam measurement
using an external reference tracking system of silicon strip detectors the intrinsic
single tube resolution was determined to be around 100 µm [8].

The tubes contributing to a track segment are selected by choosing one tube
with a hit in each layer of the chamber, which is a sample of six tubes. From the
impact radii in the two outermost tubes of this sample four possible track segment
candidates are derived. If the diﬀerence between the distance of such a candidate
to the wire and the measured drift radius does not exceed 2 mm in any of the other
tubes, a track segment is ﬁtted using this sample. If more than one track segment
is found, the one with the smallest χ2 is used. If no track segment is found, the
procedure is repeated with subsamples of ﬁve tubes.

6 Chamber Alignment

The MDT chambers in the Cosmic Ray Facility are aligned mechanically with a
precision of about 100 µm. A much more precise estimate of their relative posi-
tions is then obtained by comparing the muon track segments reconstructed in each
chamber. The optical and capacitive alignment systems are used to verify that the
setup does not move signiﬁcantly during the data taking period. In the future, the
alignment information will be included in the analysis to correct for time-dependent
position shifts of the chambers.

The positions of the two reference chambers are measured relative to the test

chamber.

• A shift vy of a reference chamber with respect to the test chamber results in a
systematic shift between the track segments in the reference and test chamber
and can be obtained from the average over all events,

sag and is taken from the hodoscope information.

5

where bref and btest are the track segment parameters deﬁned in equation (3).
They are determined with a precision of 1 µm.

• A shift vz results in a relative shift of the track segments depending on the
slope m. It is determined from a linear ﬁt to the distribution of bref − btest
versus m with an error of 10 µm.

• A shift vx along the x coordinate can be ignored, as the MDT chambers are

not sensitive to such a shift along the direction of their anode wires.

• The tilt angle α of a reference chamber around the x axis is given by the

systematic deviation of the two track segment slopes as

α = hmref − mtesti .

(6)

A precision of 10−6 is achieved.

• To determine the angles β and γ corresponding to rotations of the reference
chamber around the y and z axes, the x coordinate measurement of the ho-
doscope is used. The shifts vy and vz are calculated for three one meter wide
sections in x. From the dependences vz(x) and vy(x), the angles β and γ are
obtained with precisions of 8 × 10−6 and 10−6, respectively.

In the further analysis, the parameters of track segments in the reference cham-

bers are corrected according to the measured reference chamber positions.

7 Energy Estimation

The energy of cosmic muons traversing the Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility is
estimated from multiple scattering — which depends on the muon momentum —
in the chambers and the iron absorber.

If mref, u designates the slope of the track segment reconstructed in the upper
reference chamber and mref, l the slope of the track segment reconstructed by the
lower reference chamber, the distribution of ∆m = mref, u − mref, l will be the wider
the lower the muon energy. The standard deviation σ∆m(Eµ) has been determined
as a function of the muon energy by means of a Monte Carlo simulation and can be
parameterized as [9]

σ∆m(Eµ) = σ∞ + σ0

(7)

,

with σ∞ = (2.0 ± 0.2) · 10−4, σ0 = (1.001 ± 0.008) · 10−2, and α = 1.04 ± 0.01.

Similarly, the deviation ∆y of the position measured with the streamer tubes
from the prediction obtained from the track segment in the lower reference chamber
depends on the muon energy: For its width σ∆y(Eµ), a Monte Carlo simulation
yields the values σ∞ = (4.4 ± 0.1) mm, σ0 = (183 ± 2) mm, and α = 1.44 ± 0.01.

The probability density f for measuring deviations ∆m and ∆y is then given by

For a given track, the value of Eµ that maximizes f (Eµ) is an estimate of the muon
energy. This estimator is biased and has a limited resolution but is still useful for
a selection of high momentum muons.

8 Measurement of Wire Positions

In this section, the method for the measurement of anode wire positions is presented.
To determine wire positions, the muon track segments in the reference chambers

6

are extrapolated into the test chamber, and the drift radii measured in the test
chamber are compared with the track predictions.

The Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility is particularly sensitive to displacements
δy of the wires in the chamber plane. From this, a shift of entire tube layers in the
y direction and the mean spacing g between the wires within a layer can also be
determined.

Wire displacements δz in the plane perpendicular to the chamber are accessi-
ble via tracks with diﬀerent inclinations m (cf. equation (3)). This measurement
is less precise than the δy determination owing to the limited angular acceptance
of the trigger and the angular distribution of cosmic muons. During chamber pro-
duction, z displacement and tilts of entire tube layers are more diﬃcult to control
than individual wire displacements δz with respect to the layer. Therefore, the z
displacement for each tube layer is also measured.

The measurements are performed at both ends of the chamber by selecting
muons which passed the tested chamber within one meter of the corresponding
end of the chamber using the hodoscope information. Because the wires are only
supported at the tube ends and since the sag of the anode wires is known from
wire tension measurements these two measurements completely determine the wire
position.

8.1 Event Selection

Events with one reconstructed charged particle are selected as described in sec-
tion 3. For the further analysis, the event selection proceeds in two steps: First,
the reconstructed track segments are subjected to a set of cuts, and second, the
individual hits in the tubes must pass certain quality criteria.

The presence of a reconstructed track segment with at least 5 hits is required
in each of the three MDT chambers. The track segments must also roughly match,
i.e., |bref, u − bref, l| < 4 mm and |mref, u − mref, l| < 15 mrad. This ensures that the
track segments are not aﬀected by tubes in which delta rays4 distorted the drift time
measurement. The remaining events are called good tracks. For the determination
of wire positions, tracks with high muon momentum are desirable to limit the eﬀects
from multiple scattering. Thus, the estimated muon energy is required to be larger
than 2.5 GeV. The eﬃciencies of these track cuts are given in table 1.

Tubes in the test chamber with hits generated by delta rays would aﬀect the
measurement of the wire position, and are therefore rejected: It is demanded that
the tube have contributed to a track segment in the test chamber. Also, a loose cut
on the diﬀerence between the radius prediction from the reconstructed track seg-
ments and the measured drift radius is made. For the track segment reconstructed
in the test chamber this cut is at 0.7 mm, while it is at 1.5 mm for the predicted
radius from the reference track segments extrapolated into the test chamber5. The
eﬃciencies of these cuts are given in table 2. They are very close to 100% and thus
do not bias the wire position measurement.

8.2 Determination of the Wire Positions

The reconstructed reference chamber track segments are extrapolated into the test
chamber and the drift radius measured in the test chamber is compared with the
4Energetic primary electrons knocked from the tube walls or gas atoms by the incident charged
particle. Delta rays can lead to smaller measured drift times if they are emitted in the direction
of the anode wire.

5The larger value for the reference chamber track segments is due to the long extrapolation

distance into the test chamber.

is taken, where each uncertainty σi (i = u, l for the track segment in the upper and
lower reference chamber) depends on the extrapolation distance from the reference
chamber and the estimated muon momentum (to account for the uncertainty from
multiple scattering). The value of σi is about 200 µm for the reference chamber
closer to the tube hit and ranges from 350 to 800 µm for the farther chamber.

If a given wire is displaced by δy in the y direction and δz in the z direction, the
measured drift radius rdrift in the tube will show a systematic deviation ∆r from
the predicted reference radius,

∆r = rdrift − rref = δy − m δz + O(m2) ,

(10)

as shown in ﬁgure 5.

8.3 Determination of the Wire Position Perpendicular to the

Chamber Plane

The displacement δz of an individual anode wire is determined from the slope in a
linear ﬁt to the distribution of ∆r vs. m.

The z displacement of an entire tube layer and its tilt corresponding to a rotation
about the x axis are determined from the distribution of measured δz values of all
tubes as a function of their y coordinate6. A linear ﬁt to this δz distribution is
performed separately for each layer. The oﬀset and slope of the ﬁtted line are taken
to be the z displacement and tilt of the layer, respectively.

6Here, y is taken to be the nominal wire position. Because of the large chamber width, this

approximation does not bias the result.

8

In the further analysis, each wire is assigned the measured z position of the layer
at the nominal y wire position. The single wire position measurement is used for
wires where it deviates from the layer position by more than 3 standard deviations.

8.4 Determination of the Wire Position in the Chamber Plane

Using the z position measurement described above, the displacement δy of an anode
wire is obtained as

′

h∆r

i = hr

′
ref − rdrifti = δy − hmiδz

′

≈ δy ,

(11)

where r′
ref denotes the predicted radius corrected for the wire z position and the
residual displacement δz′ after correction is of the order of the resolution of the
z position measurement. The average of the track slopes h|hmiall hits|iall tubes is7
0.06, the largest value of |hmiall hits| for a single tube being 0.15. Therefore, the
systematic error introduced in the last approximation of equation (11) is typically
much smaller than 15% times the resolution on the z position, which does not limit
the δy measurement.

In the chamber plane, the nominal wire positions can be described by a grid of

the form

y(n) = y0 + n g ,

(12)

where n denotes the index of the tube in the layer, y0 the oﬀset of the layer position
relative to the other layers in the same chamber, and g the mean distance between
two neighbouring wires. Fitting the function in equation (12) to the distribution of
the wire positions of one tube layer yields the oﬀset y0 and the mean distance g for
that layer.

8.5 Test of the Method

In order to test the method described above, one of the few chambers which have
been scanned by the X-ray tomograph at CERN has been used as a test chamber.
Two tomograph scans of the chamber were performed at a distance of 30 cm from
each chamber end. Therefore the positions of the anode wires8 are known with a
precision of 2 µm.

The analysis uses 28 hours of data taken with this chamber. During this time
1.7 million events per meter along the anode wires (x direction) have been recorded.
The number of events after each step of the event selection and the number of tube
hits in the test chamber used for the wire position measurements are given in tables 1
and 2.

All measurements at the Cosmic Ray Facility are in very good agreement with

the tomograph results.

In ﬁgure 6, the δz measurements for single wires performed at the Cosmic Ray
Facility are compared with the results of the tomograph scans. The distributions of
the diﬀerence between the cosmic ray measurement and the tomograph scan have
widths of 23 µm and 27 µm. These widths are dominated by the resolution of the
Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility.

A better precision can be obtained for the z displacement of entire tube layers.
A comparison of this measurement and the values for the tilt angle of the tube layers
around the x axis (the parameters which are more diﬃcult to control during the
MDT chamber assembly) with the tomograph results is shown in ﬁgures 7 and 8.
7The deviation from 0 is caused by a slight asymmetry of the trigger eﬃciency in the y direction

The comparison of the δy measurement with cosmic rays with the tomograph

8.5 µm at either end of the chamber (see ﬁgure 9). The precision of the Cosmic Ray
Measurement Facility is therefore 8.3 µm (after subtraction of the uncertainty on
the X-ray tomograph measurement).

The measurements of the layer oﬀset y0 and the wire grid constant g are com-
pared in ﬁgures 10 and 11. A precision of 1.8 µm for the layer oﬀset and 0.15 µm
for the grid constant is achieved.

9 Conclusions

In the Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility, ATLAS MDT muon chambers are tested
and calibrated. The Cosmic Ray Measurement Facility is capable of measuring the
positions of the individual anode wires of a chamber with a precision of 8.3 µm in
the chamber plane and 27 µm in the direction perpendicular to that plane after 28
hours of data taking.

In addition to the wire positions, the oﬀsets of the tube layers relative to each
other in the chamber plane and their grid constants have been determined with

precisions of 1.8 µm and 0.15 µm, respectively. The positions of the tube layers
in the direction perpendicular to the chamber plane and the angles for a rotation
around an axis parallel to the wires have been measured with precisions of 4.4 µm
and 17 × 10−6, respectively.

At a rate of up to two tested chambers per week, all 88 BOS chambers which
are produced in Munich will be tested until the planned start of muon chamber
installation in ATLAS.

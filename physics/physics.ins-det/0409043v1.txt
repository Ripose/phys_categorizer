POSITRON/PROTON SEPARATION USING THE AMS-02 TRD

ABSTRACT

AMS-02 is a cosmic ray experiment that will be placed on the International Space
Station. One of its goals is to search for WIMP Dark Matter, speciﬁcally from
anomalous features in the positron spectrum. In order to identify positrons at high
energy from the large background of protons, a Transition Radiation Detector (TRD)
will be used. Here we will present studies of positron/proton separation using the
TRD from the AMS-02 Simulation.

1 DARK MATTER SEARCH

One of the leading candidates for dark matter is WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Mas-
sive Particles) of which a favored type is the supersymmetric (SUSY) neutralino,
a linear superposition of the SUSY partners to the photon, Z 0, and Higgs bosons.
There is a ﬁnite cross-section for neutralinos to annihilate with each other and thus
produce standard particles such as positrons, electrons, anti-protons, etc. The out-
put of such annhilations in the Milky Way halo may be detectable as a bump in the
power-law spectrum of positrons [1].

2 AMS TRD Simulation

Transition radiation occurs when a highly relativistic (γ > 300) charged particle
passes through a material with varying index of refraction and emits an X-ray. A
simulation code primarily based on Geant 3.21 is used to study the ability of the
TRD to separate highly relativistic positrons from slower protons with the same
energy [2]. The TRD geometry includes 20 layers of radiator and straw tubes with
a mixture of gaseous Xe:CO2 in a ratio of 80:20 by volume. The code simulates TR
photon generation/absorption as well as standard dE
dX loss in the thin Xe gas layers
of the straw tubes and has been shown to reproduce test beam results.[3]

3 Positron/Proton Separation Algorithm

These studies used monoenergetic (50 GeV) protons/positrons generated at random
angles and positions above the AMS detector. A log likelihood method was used to
separate the positrons from the protons.[4] The log likelihood is deﬁned as:

L =

log

N

X
i=1

P (dEi|e)
P (dEi|p) + P (dEi|e)

(1)

where N is the number of straw tube hits in a particular event. P (dEi|e) and
P (dEi|p) are probability density functions for a positron (e) and proton (p) to
deposit energy dEi in the ith straw tube, respectively. The current method of
evaluating e/p separation starts with creating distributions of energy deposited in
each straw tube for protons and positrons using the AMS simulation. One hit is
the total energy deposited in a particular straw tube for an event, and may include
dE
dX and TR X-rays. Normalizing these histograms by the total number of proton
(positron) hits we get the probabilities that a proton (positron) will deposit a speciﬁc
amount of energy in a straw tube. Next we use the log likelihood ratio estimator in
Equation 1 to create distributions of L, for both positron and proton events.

Then the fraction of positrons (protons) above a threshold likelihood Lth
deﬁnes the positron eﬃciency (proton contamination). Integrating to the right of Lth
determines the eﬃciency vs Lth. Our goal is to minimize the proton contamination
while keeping a reasonable positron eﬃciency. Finally we plot proton contamination
vs positron eﬃciency, where each point of the plot corresponds to a diﬀerent Lth.
To compare particle separation qualities for diﬀerent conﬁgurations, we choose a
threshold likelihood for which 90% of the positrons satisfy the likelihood cut.

4 STUDIES AND RESULTS

Initial results showed that proton rejections of approximately 10−3 could be achieved
while only throwing away 10% of the positron signal. This was obtained by using all
the hits in each event. Studies were conducted at diﬀerent particle momentum. The
results agreed with the expectation that the separation became worse as the mo-
mentum rose and protons themselves began to emit transition radiation. Removing
even 2 layers had a drastically negative aﬀect on the separation (factor of 1.5 at 100
GeV). Studies were also conducted to determine how noise in the gas-gain would
aﬀect the positron/proton separation. Uncorrelated variations in the gas-gain had
a small eﬀect on separation until they reached 30% of the total gain.

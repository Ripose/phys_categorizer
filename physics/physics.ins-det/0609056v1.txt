Imaging of single infrared, optical, and ultraviolet photons using distributed tunnel
junction readout on superconducting absorbers

(Dated: January 25, 2014)

Single-photon imaging spectrometers of high quantum eﬃciency in the infrared to ultraviolet
wavelength range, with good timing resolution and with a vanishing dark count rate are on top
of the wish list in earth-bound astronomy, material and medical sciences, or quantum information
technologies. We review and present improved operation of a cryogenic detector system potentially
oﬀering all these qualities. It is based on a superconducting absorber strip read out with super-
conducting tunnel junctions. The detector performance is discussed in terms of responsivity, noise
properties, energy and position resolution. Dynamic processes involved in the signal creation and de-
tection are investigated for a basic understanding of the physics, and for possible application-speciﬁc
modiﬁcations of device characteristics.

INTRODUCTION

Superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) detectors are
among the most advanced cryogenic sensors1 with intrin-
sic spectroscopic resolution and high detection eﬃciency
over a broad energy range. Essential advantages of low-
temperature detectors in general are the small energy
gap in superconductors compared to standard semicon-
ductors (typically three orders of magnitude lower), de-
coupling of the electron and phonon systems in normal
metals below about 50 mK, and a vanishing lattice heat
capacity.

The lifetime of nonequilibrium quasiparticles gener-
ated in superconductors due to local energy deposition
in excess of a purely thermal distribution becomes very
large at operating temperatures well below the transition
temperature. Those quasiparticles can be eﬃciently de-
tected as a tunnel current in an STJ if tunneling rates
are high compared to recombination and loss processes.
In the tunneling process, a quasiparticle can tunnel back
and contribute many times to the total charge transfer.2
This internal ampliﬁcation process is a unique feature of
STJs which signiﬁcantly improves the sensitivity of the
detectors, allowing us to observe single sub-eV energy
quanta.

As a next generation detector, STJs are very promis-
ing candidates e.g. for astronomical observations.3,4 In
addition to their direct spectroscopic response and high
speed (<
105 counts/s), they can be operated with es-
∼
sentially no dark count rate, which is another enormous
advantage compared to CCD imaging systems, making
them the favored choice for detection of faint objects.
However, to satisfy the desire for detectors with imaging
capabilities as oﬀered by CCD cameras, a competitive
STJ based multipixel camera inevitably faces the com-
plexity of large channel-number readout, i.e. the problem
of transferring the small charge-signals from the cryo-
genic environment to external room-temperature elec-
tronics. One possible solution to reduce the number of
readout lines is by using distributed readout imaging de-

vices (DROIDs), where the quasiparticle distribution in
a large superconducting absorber is detected with several
STJs at diﬀerent positions. This type of detector was in-
vestigated with x-rays5,6,7,8,9,10,11 as well as with optical
photons.12,13,14,15,16

In this paper we present measurements with quasi-
onedimensional DROIDs irradiated with energy quanta
covering the ultraviolet (UV) and the entire optical
range, and including an extension to near infrared (IR)
energies below 1 eV. After a description of device prop-
erties, experimental conditions and measurement proce-
dure in Sec. II, the linearity of detector response, the
noise performance and the resolution in energy and po-
sition are discussed in Sec. III A. Time-dependent pro-
cesses in the detector involving quasiparticle diﬀusion,
loss and trapping rates, are considered in more detail in
Sec. III B. The paper concludes in Sec. IV.

II. EXPERIMENT

×

WTa = 135

The devices were fabricated by sputter deposition on
a sapphire substrate. The Ta absorber was deposited
31.5 µm2 and a
ﬁrst, with an area of LTa
thickness of 100 nm. The square shaped Ta-Al junctions
with a side length Lj = 25 µm and an Al layer thick-
ness of 38 nm were fabricated at each end on top of the
absorber. Hence, the length of the bare absorber was
Lb,Ta = 80 µm. The residual resistivity ratio of the ab-
25, where ρRT and ρLT are
sorber was RRR = ρRT/ρLT ≈
the (normal) resistivities at room temperature and low
temperature, respectively.

×

The cryogenic detectors were operated at 310 mK and
the supercurrent was suppressed by application of a mag-
netic ﬁeld parallel to the tunnel barrier. With two
independent charge-sensitive preampliﬁers operated at
room temperature the devices were voltage biased at
Vb = 80 µV where a thermal current below 50 pA was
measured. At this bias voltage the current I was found
to depend on temperature T according to the empirical

expression I = 0.345 exp(T /26.4 mK) fA. Although the
200 µV,
minimum thermal current was observed at Vb ≈
the responsivity of the devices showed a maximum at
lower Vb, in the range of negative diﬀerential resistance of
the current-voltage characteristics. We introduced ohmic
resistors of 5 kΩ in the signal lines (in series) close to the
devices, which acted together with the junction capaci-
tances as eﬃcient RC ﬁlters against high-frequency noise
on the 1.2 m cables, as well as damping resistors against
resonances of the junction-cable system corresponding to
an LRC circuit with intrinsically low damping constant.
Compared to the superconducting device resistance on
the order of 1 MΩ the inﬂuence of the ﬁlters on the de-
tector response was negligible.

A variety of pulsed light-emitting diodes (LEDs) was
used as light sources, with wavelengths ranging from IR
at 1550 nm (0.801 eV) to UV at 370 nm (3.355 eV). The
speciﬁed spectral widths of the LEDs were typically a
few percent. The photons were coupled to the detectors
via optical ﬁbres and through the sapphire substrate.
Back-illumination through the substrate was found to
be essential for optimum detector performance, probably
thanks to a clean, oxide-free interface, whereas the native
TaOx on top of the absorber appears to be less transpar-
ent. The light intensity (pulse duration) was adjusted to
observe on the order of one photon per pulse. Packets
of (incoherent) multiple photons were synchronized to a
maximum time spread of less than 200 ns.

Detection eﬃciency of Ta absorbers is about 60% for
optical and UV photons, but it drops drastically below
red photon energies <
2 eV.17 Radiation shorter than
∼
about 200 nm is expected to be cut oﬀ by the sapphire
substrate.18 Unfortunately, we had no reference system
for calibrating the absolute photon absorption probabil-
ity.

The electronic signals from the preampliﬁers had a rise-
time of about 1 µs (comparable to the tunneling time and
to the
1 MHz bandwidth of the readout electronics)
and a decay on the order of 30 µs. The preampliﬁer out-
puts were band-pass ﬁltered with a 10 µs time constant
and digitized for oﬄine analysis.

∼

Due to noticeable dependence of the device respon-
sivity on Vb and on electronics settings the system was
calibrated against an electronic pulser injecting a deﬁned
number of charges. The charge noise of the readout elec-
tronics with the junctions connected (but not irradiated)
was determined from pulser distribution spread or from
2760 e for both chan-
rms noise measurements to be qe ≈
nels combined, i.e. about 1950 e for each individual chan-
nel (at Vb = 80 µV).

Figure 1 shows results from measurements with UV as
well as with IR photons. The charges Q1 and Q2 refer
to the separate outputs from the two channels. The left-
hand plots display the total charge QΣ = Q1 + Q2 versus
the normalized (onedimensional) position of the photon
interaction x0 = (Q1

the data with respect to x0 are due to the diﬃculty of
perfect adjustment of operating point for the two chan-

detector, very close to junction 1. Therefore, a fraction
of the quasiparticles generated in the ground electrode
leak into that STJ and contribute a measurable signal.
This eﬀect exempliﬁes that one can in principle design
any absorber shape appropriate for a speciﬁc imaging
purpose.

The expected number N0 of excited quasiparticles gen-
erated upon deposition of energy E is N0 = E/1.7∆
where ∆ is the energy gap of the superconducting ab-
sorber and 1.7∆ is the eﬀective energy to create one
quasiparticle.19,20,21 Note that the energy conversion fac-
tor 1.7 is appropriate for Ta, but in general it is material
dependent.21 The intrinsic energy ﬂuctuations εi of STJs

A. Linear response and spectral resolution

At temperatures well below the superconducting tran-
sition temperature, where quasiparticle recombination
processes are very slow, and for suﬃciently low energy
densities of the nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution
(i.e. for optical photons, where self-recombination is neg-
ligible), a linear response of the detector is predicted for
single STJ detectors23 as well as for DROIDs.24 In or-
der to test the linearity of our detectors we performed
measurements with photon energies ranging from IR to
UV. Similar to Figs. 1(b) and (d) we consider only pho-
ton events with interactions in a narrow window of the
absorber’s central region, i.e. satisfying
< 0.05. In
addition to single-photon events we also extract the sig-
nals due to simultaneous two-photon events where data
of minimum interaction distance is selected. This con-
dition corresponds to the low edge of the two-photon
events contour in Fig. 1(a) and to the prominent peak
at
160 ke in Fig. 1(b), whereas events of two photons
interacting at largest distance (i.e. close to the junctions)
are expected to appear at the upper contour edge.

If we neglect quasiparticle losses during diﬀusion,
the charge noise can be translated into an imaging
position resolution δx
(LTa/xmax)(qi/QΣ) as dis-
played in Fig. 2(d), where xmax = 0.41 in our de-
vices accounts for the reduced trapping eﬃciency (see
Sec. III B). The energy-dependent number of eﬀective
pixels
LTa/2.355δx is in our case in the range of 3 . . . 6
(neglecting the real geometry where about one third of
the absorber is modiﬁed by trapping regions). A possi-
ble improvement in position resolution, however, can be
obtained for longer absorbers (for the price of reduced en-
ergy resolution due to diﬀusion losses) by measuring the
time delay of the charge signals in the two channels. As-
suming a moderate timing accuracy of 1 µs we estimate
from our timing measurements (roughly 6 µs diﬀerential
delay over Lb,Ta, see Sec. III B) a spatial resolution of
6
pixels, which is already comparable to the charge-noise
limited values.

∼

Finally, the energy-resolving power R of our DROIDs
is plotted in Fig. 2(e), showing a comfortable signal-to-
noise ratio for single-photon imaging down to near IR
wavelengths.

B. Quasiparticle diﬀusion

After localized energy deposition in a superconductor,
cascades of several fast processes eventually end with a
population of excess quasiparticles. Those initial con-
version processes are negligibly fast compared to quasi-
particle recombination and loss times.20,27 Therefore, we
expect our measurable device dynamics to be dominated
by diﬀusion and subsequent trapping and tunneling pro-
cesses. Quasiparticle diﬀusion in the absorber can be
described by the onedimensional equation

This model allows us to ﬁt the experimental data as

guish between the bare Ta absorber and the proximized

energy relevant for quasiparticle generation is reduced.

and Q0,b = 58.6 ke for the bare absorber. Applying the
same function to the data for
> 0.3 while keeping
the formerly found α and β ﬁxed yields Q0,t = 69.1 ke
in the trap regions. This implies that the mean gap en-
ergy in the trap region where quasiparticle generation
takes place is reduced by (1
Q0,b/Q0,t) = 15.2%. The
empirical ﬁt to a Monte Carlo simulation14 has found a
reduction of about 12.5% for the same devices. The dis-
crepancy between the results from the two approaches
is acceptable considering the uncertainties in empirical
parameter adjustment in the latter method. One should
note that the energy gap of 0.848∆Ta = 594 µeV in the
trap region is not equivalent to the one at the tunnel bar-
rier where about 450 µeV was found from current-voltage
characteristics measurements. This is well understood in
terms of the superconducting proximity eﬀect.28

For the parameter β the simulations14 found β
≈
(Ploss,Abs/Ptrap)1/2 = 0.483. This value is slightly lower
than our model ﬁt parameter because the simulations14
consider a trapping and a tunneling probability sep-
arately (i.e. a nonvanishing detrapping probability),
whereas our model averages over trapping and detrap-
ping processes and therefore results in a lower eﬀective
trapping rate.

The quasiparticle diﬀusion length in our absorber, i.e.
the average length a quasiparticle travels before being
lost by recombination or other loss channels, is

which suggests that there is still room for a longitudinal
extension of the absorber. In the expression above we use
LTa (and not Lb,Ta) as the eﬀective absorber length based
on the following argument: A quasiparticle entering the
trap region travels, if not tunneling before, a distance 2Lj
until it has the ﬁrst chance to detrap. The average trap-
ping length Λβ2 is on the order of 2Lj (calculated with ei-
ther LTa or Lb,Ta). The mean distance in the trap region
travelled by quasiparticles which are being trapped is
therefore roughly Lj. Consequently, the absorber length
relevant for our analysis is Lb,Ta + 2Lj = LTa. Alter-
natively, we can consider quasiparticles starting in the
trap region with arbitrary direction and position. Those
which are detected in the opposite STJ travel in aver-
age a distance Lj before leaving the trap. Therefore, the
in Fig. 3 are identiﬁed with the phys-

Measurements of the trigger time diﬀerences δtm be-
tween the two pulse-shaped detector signals for thresh-
olds set arbitrarily at 33% and 67% of the peak ampli-
tudes are shown in Fig. 4. An S-shaped timing versus
position curve, which we observed for fast signals, was
stretched to a straight line after pulse-shaping with a
time constant one order of magnitude larger than the
original signal rise-time. The results of a linear ﬁt to the

trap regions are excluded from the ﬁt because they show
a slight extra time delay.

This observation is interpreted as a consequence of de-
layed detrapping, namely the quasiparticles detected in
the opposite STJ have a non-zero probability to propa-
gate within the trap for some time before leaving for the
other side. In addition, they may initially go through a
few backtunneling cycles, which further delays the oppo-
site charge signal by the extra tunneling times.

We have numerically simulated the quasiparticle prop-
agation according to Eq. (2) to determine the detector-
signal dynamics including the response of readout elec-
tronics and pulse shaping. The normalized timing diﬀer-
ences δtn between the two channels calculated for trigger
thresholds at 33% and 67% were 0.336 and 0.351, re-

Inserting our experimental results (always for single-
photon events only) yields position resolutions in the
range δx
26.7 . . . 14.8 µm, corresponding to 5 . . . 9 pix-
els for our detector. This is in fair agreement with our
former approximations. However, we wish to empha-
size that all these rough estimates ignore the geometrical
properties of the real absorber, which needs to be taken
into account for a quantitatively precise analysis of posi-
tion resolution.32

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Detection of single (and simultaneous multiple) pho-
tons with good spectral and spacial resolution was per-
formed with STJ based DROIDs. Single-photon resolu-
tion down to near IR energies was proven, with a per-
fectly linear energy response over the entire UV to IR
wavelength range. Sensitivity to the investigated photon
energies was possible due to the backtunneling eﬀect, de-
livering in our case a device-intrinsic gain of about 33,
which is a feature unique to STJs. The detectors were
found to operate close to the thermodynamic limit im-
posed by particle ﬂuctuation statistics.

The measured dynamic response of the DROIDs was
compared to numerical modelling based on quasiparticle

diﬀusion including loss and trapping processes. The pa-
rameters extracted from experimental data are physically
meaningful and coincide reasonably with former Monte
Carlo simulations.14 However, the diﬀusion constant was
found to signiﬁcantly disagree with theoretical predic-
tions, similar to all preceding experiments of the same
kind.

Position resolution of our relatively short absorber was
estimated to about 3 . . . 6 equivalent pixels for photon
energies in the range 0.8 . . . 3.4 eV. By taking the dif-
ferential time delays of the two channels into account,
we predict an improvement in position resolution by at
least a factor of two for a longer absorber (LTa
Λ) and
better trapping eﬃciencies (τtrap ≪
High-sensitivity spectrometers with single-photon
counting capabilities in the broad optical range are
not only of high interest for astronomical observations.
Single photons at the telecommunication wavelength
of 1550 nm are currently used, e.g., in intense studies
on quantum cryptography,33 which links information
theory to quantum entanglement physics. Hence, STJ
based DROIDs with the properties and potential as
presented in this paper may as well be an interesting and
natural choice for IR single-photon counting experiments.

Abstract

We have studied the feasibility of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) to detect liquid
xenon (LXe) scintillation light. The SiPM was operated inside a small volume of
pure LXe, at -95oC, irradiated with an internal 241Am α source. The gain of the
SiPM at this temperature was estimated to be 1.8 × 106 with bias voltage at 52
V. Based on the geometry of the setup, the quantum eﬃciency of the SiPM was
estimated to be 22% at the Xe wavelength of 178 nm. The low excess noise factor,
high single photoelectron detection eﬃciency, and low bias voltage of SiPMs make
them attractive alternative UV photon detection devices to photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs) for liquid xenon detectors, especially for experiments requiring a very low
energy detection threshold, such as neutralino dark matter searches.

1 Introduction

The SiPM[1] is a promising Avanche Photodiode (APD) variant consisting
of 576 silicon micro pixels per square mm of detector surface. Each pixel is
a 21 × 21µm2 independent photon micro-counter operating in limited Geiger
mode with gain of 106. All SiPM pixels are connected to the common load, so
the output signal is the sum of all signals. Thus a proportional signal is created
by the sum of the digital micro-APD (pixel) signals. The main features of SiPM
are low excess noise factor, low bias voltage (50V), and excellent timing (30
ps for 10 photoelectrons). SiPMs have a low excess noise factor comparable
to the Hybrid Photodiode (HPD)[2] because the gain mechanism relies on
counting how many of the micro-APDs have ﬁred. The SiPM noise is high at

room temperatures[1], but is reduced signiﬁcantly when operated at cryogenic
temperatures. The photon detection eﬃciency is similar to a PMT, but comes
from the product of a higher quantum eﬃciency (QE) multiplied by the ratio
of sensitive area to the total detector area. It is thus well-suited to a purely
solid state solution to LXe scintillation detection.

Liquid xenon is a very good scintillation material for various applications of
particle detection[3,4,5,6]. The Columbia group, in particular, is interested in
development of a liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) for Compton
imaging of MeV sources in high energy astrophysics [7], and more recently,
in the development of a dual phase (liquid/gas) TPC for the direct detection
of dark matter particles in the form of WIMPs (Weakly interacting massive
particles)[8]. In all these applications, eﬃcient detection of the LXe scintilla-
tion is key to the sensitivity of the detector and its minimum energy threshold.

The wavelength of liquid xenon scintillation light is centered around 178 nm
[9], making its detection a challenge. Currently, the TPC for the XENON Dark
Matter Search[8] uses compact metal channel PMTs to detect both primary
and proportional scintillation light produced by WIMPs nuclear recoils. These
PMTs (R9288 and R8520) produced by Hamamatsu Photonics Co., have a
typical quantum eﬃciencies of 20% at liquid xenon temperature ( −95oC).

Within the R&D for XENON, we have tested alternative UV photon sensors
in liquid xenon, including multi-channel plate PMTs (MCP-PMT) and large
area avalanche photodiodes (LAAPDs). The SiPM is another very promising
device, which can detect a small amount of light, with a very good single
photoelectron detection capability. Here we summarize our ﬁrst attempt to
detect liquid xenon scintillation light with a small SiPM immersed in liquid
xenon.

2 Experimental Apparatus

The LXe detector used for the test of the SiPM is the same one used for test-
ing diﬀerent light sensors, including the Hamamatsu metal channel PMT[10]
and the LAAPD[11]. The detector consists of a 6 cm diameter stainless steel
electrode with a radioactive alpha source 241Am deposited in its center. The
1 × 1mm2 SiPM (type Z, serial number 217) was mounted on a Teﬂon support
plate facing the source plate. A blue LED was also mounted on the Teﬂon
plate. The distance between source and SiPM was 4.7 mm. The detector was
pumped down to a vacuum level of 10−8Torr and baked out for 36 hours before
ﬁlling with LXe. Xe gas, puriﬁed through a SAES getter 1 , was condensed in

the detector vessel, cooled by a bath of liquid nitrogen and alcohol mixture
at −95oC. Fig.1 shows a schematic of detector, gas system and electronics. A
scope trace of the blue LED signal as detected by SiPM is shown in Fig. 2.

The scintillation photons, absorbed by the SiPM, produce photoelectrons
which are consequently ampliﬁed inside the silicon via a Geiger mode avalanche.
The SiPM electrical signal is fed into a charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer, followed
by an ORTEC 450 shaping ampliﬁer. A test pulse generator is used to calibrate
electronics chain system.

3 Results

3.1 Calibration

The great advantage of a SiPM is that it is self-calibrating, since its single
photoelectron sensitivity can be used for calibration. The resulting low am-
plitude part of the α-source spectrum is shown in Fig. 3. Note the excellent
resolution (low excess noise factor) that allows up to 11 photoelecton peaks to

3.2 Gain measurement

We have estimated the SiPM gain g with a calibrated test pulse signal as
follows:

g =

where Vt and Mt are the test pulse amplitude and channel number in the
MCA spectrum, respectively. C is the capacitance of the charge sensitive pre-
ampliﬁer. M1 ≈ 6.2 is number of channels corresponding to a single photo-
electron and q is the elementary electronic charge. A ≈ 27 is the gain of the
ampliﬁcation system used in this measurement. Based on these values, the
SiPM gain is estimated to be around 1.8 × 106 at the operation voltage of 52
V.

3.3 Quantum Eﬃciency Estimation

In Fig. 5 the 241Am α-source energy spectrum, measured with the SiPM bias
voltage at 52 V, is shown.

Since the SiPM signal is calibrated in units of photoelectrons, the average
number of photoelectrons detected from LXe scintillation light induced by

241Am α particles is determined to be 55 p.e.

The total number of scintillation photons striking the SiPM can be calculated
using the energy of α particle (5.48 MeV), the average energy needed to pro-
duce single scintillation photon in LXe (19.6 eV for α particle [12]), and the
geometrical acceptance of the SiPM detector. For the detector geometry used
in the tests, the average number of scintillation photons produced by one 5.48
MeV α particle striking the SiPM surface is Nph = 1006 photons. Thus the
measured photon detection eﬃciency is ε = 55p.e.
1006ph. = 5.5%. The quantum ef-
ﬁciency of the SiPM (QE) can be calculated as QE = ε/A, where A is the
active area ratio of the device. Assuming A = 0.254[1], we infer a QE = 22%
including the probability of initiating the Geiger avalanche.

4 Conclusion

A silicon photomultiplier was tested for the ﬁrst time in LXe to detect its
scintillation light at λ = 178 nm, at an operation temperature at −95oC. A
high quantum eﬃciency of 22% has been demostrated. Large arrays of SiPMs
oﬀer a promising solid state photodetector approach for reaching out LXe
detectors in applications ranging from γ-ray astrophysics to particle physics
and medical imaging.

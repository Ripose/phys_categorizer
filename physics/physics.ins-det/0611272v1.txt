Abstract
Results of detailed simulations of the charge transfer inefﬁciency of a prototype CCD chip
are reported. The effect of radiation damage in a particle detector operating at a future
accelerator is studied by examining two electron trap levels, 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV below the
bottom of the conduction band. Good agreement is found between simulations using the ISE-
TCAD DESSIS program and an analytical model for the 0.17 eV level. Optimum operation is
predicted to be at about 250 K where the effect of the traps is minimal which is approximately
independent of readout frequency. This work has been carried out within the Linear Collider

Abstract— Results of detailed simulations of the charge trans-
fer inefﬁciency of a prototype CCD chip are reported. The effect
of radiation damage in a particle detector operating at a future
accelerator is studied by examining two electron trap levels,
0.17 eV and 0.44 eV below the bottom of the conduction band.
Good agreement is found between simulations using the ISE-
TCAD DESSIS program and an analytical model for the 0.17 eV
level. Optimum operation is predicted to be at about 250 K
where the effect of the traps is minimal which is approximately
independent of readout frequency. This work has been carried

(ILC) project.

I. INTRODUCTION

Particle physicists worldwide are working on the design
of a high energy collider of electrons and positrons (the
International Linear Collider or ILC) which could be oper-
ational sometime after 2016. Any experiment exploiting the
ILC will require a high performance vertex detector to detect
and measure short-lived particles. One candidate for such a
device would consist of a set of concentric cylinders of charge-
coupled devices (CCDs).

An important requirement of a vertex detector is to remain

tolerant to radiation damage for its anticipated lifetime.

CCDs suffer from both surface and bulk radiation damage.
However, when considering charge transfer losses in buried
channel devices only bulk traps are important. These defects
create energy levels between the conduction and valence band,
hence electrons may be captured by these new levels. These
electrons are also emitted back to the conduction band after a
certain time. For a signal packet this may lead to a decrease in
charge as it is transferred to the output and may be quantiﬁed
by its Charge Transfer Inefﬁciency (CTI), where a charge of
amplitude Q0 transported across m pixels will have a reduced
charge given by

Qm = Q0(1 − CTI)m.

(1)

The CTI value depends on many parameters, some related
to the trap characteristics such as: trap energy level, capture
cross-section, and trap concentration (density). Operating con-
ditions also affect the CTI as there is a strong temperature
dependence on the trap capture rate and also a variation of the
CTI with the readout frequency. Other factors are also relevant,

for example the occupancy ratio of pixels, which inﬂuences the
fraction of ﬁlled traps in the CCD transport region. Previous
studies have been reported [1]–[5].

II. SIMULATIONS

The UK Linear Collider Flavour Identiﬁcation (LCFI) col-
laboration [6], [7] has been studying a device produced by e2V
Technologies, with a manufacturer’s designation ‘CCD58’. It
is a 2.1 Mpixel, three-phase buried-channel CCD with 12 µm
square pixels.

Simulations of a simpliﬁed model of this have been per-
formed with the ISE-TCAD package (version 7.5), particularly
the DESSIS program (Device Simulation for Smart Integrated
Systems). It contains an input gate, an output gate, a substrate
gate and nine further gates (numbered 1 to 9) which form the
pixels. Each pixel consists of 3 gates but only one pixel is
important for this study—gates 5, 6 and 7. The simulation is
essentially two dimensional but internally there is a nominal
1 µm device thickness (width). This is equivalent to a thin
slice of the device with rectangular pixels 12 µm long by 1 µm
wide. The overall length and depth of the simulated device are
44 µm and 20 µm respectively (Fig. 1).

Parameters of interest are the readout frequency, up to
50 MHz, and the operating temperature between 120 K and
300 K although simulations have been done up to 500 K. The
charge in transfer and the trapped charge are shown in Fig. 2.

charge density, from transfer of signal charge. The legend box refers to the
region with positive depth values. The thin brown line is an oxide layer and
the thin yellow line is a nitride layer.

The signal charge used in the simulation is chosen to
be similar to the charge generated by a minimum ionising
particle (MIP), amounting to about 1620 electron-hole pairs1
for CCD58. DESSIS has a directive for generating heavy
ions and this is exploited to create the charges. The heavy
ion is made to travel in a downwards direction starting at
1.2 µm below gate 2 at 1 µs before charge transfer begins. This
provides ample time for the electrons to be drawn upwards
to the transport channel which is 0.25 µm beneath the gate
electrodes.

A. Calculating CTI

Charge Transfer Inefﬁciency is a measure of the fractional
loss of charge from a signal packet as it is transferred over
a pixel, or three gates. After DESSIS has simulated the
transfer process, a 2D integration of the trapped charge density
distribution is performed independently to give a total charge
under each gate.

The CTI for transfer over one gate is equivalent to

CT I =

eT − eB
eS

(2)

where:

• eS = electron signal packet density,

1This number has to be divided by 12 because the charge is assumed to
be distributed over the whole pixel but the model has only 1/12th of the true
pixel volume.

• eB = background trapped electron charge density prior to

signal packet transfer,

• eT = trapped electron charge density under the gate, after

signal transfer across gate.

In this way the CTI is normalised for each gate. The determi-
nations of the trapped charge take place for gate n when the
charge packet just arrives at gate n + 1. If the determination
were made only when the packet has cleared all three gates
of the pixel, trapped charge may have leaked out of the traps.
The total CTI (per pixel) is determined from gates 5, 6 and

7, hence

CT I =

7

Xn=5

eT − eB
eS

(3)

where n is the gate number. The background charge is taken as
the trapped charge under gate 2 because this gate is unaffected
by the signal transport when the charge has just passed gates
being processed.

B. Initial tests of the DESSIS program

DESSIS simulations have been carried out with a zero

concentration of electron traps as in unirradiated silicon.

The DESSIS program is steered with a command ﬁle which
contains electrode voltage values for each of the three phases
as a function of time. For these simulations the voltage values
(peak value 7 V), which were originally digitised from real
experiments with CCD58, were replaced by reduced values
without altering the frequency or phase.

Since there were no traps there was no trapped charge so
a different estimator of CTI is required. The electron charge
density left under gate n when the charge packet has moved
to gate n + 1 gives the partial CTI estimator. It is normalised
by the original electron charge density. As before, the CTI for
a pixel is computed by adding the partial CTI’s for gates 5,
6, and 7.

Figure 3 shows the variation of CTI with temperature for
various clock voltages. Figure 4 shows the variation of CTI
with clock voltage for a range of temperatures. The device

from the interaction point, one can estimate an e+e−
ﬂux around 3.5 hits/cm2/bunch crossing which gives a ﬂu-
ence of 0.5×1012 e/cm2/year. In the case of neutrons, from
the ﬂuence was estimated to be
two independent studies,
1010 n/cm2/year [11] and 1.6×1010 n/cm2/year [12].

Based on the literature [13]–[21], the trap densities intro-
duced by 1 MeV neutrons and 10 MeV electrons have been
estimated with two established assumptions: the electron trap
density is a linear function of dose, and the dose is a linear
function of ﬂuence. A summary is given in Table 2.

D. Partially Filled Traps

Each electron trap in the semiconductor material can either
be empty (holding no electron) or full (holding one elec-
tron). In order to simulate the normal operating conditions
of CCD58, partial trap ﬁlling was employed in the simulation
(which means that some traps are full and some are empty)
because the device will transfer many charge packets during
continuous operation.

In order to reﬂect this, even though only the transfer of a
single charge packet was simulated, the following procedure
was followed in all cases. From t = 0 seconds to t = 98 µs, the
gates ramp up and are biased in such a way to drain the charge
to the output drain. The device is in a fully normal biased
state then at 98 µs. To obtain partial trap ﬁlling, the simulation
waits2 2 µs between 98 µs and 100 µs to allow traps to partially
empty. The test charge is generated at 99 µs. The simulation
then starts the three clock phases, varying voltage with time
to cause the transfer of the signal charge packet through the
device.

III. ANALYTICAL MODELS

The motivation for introducing the following two simple
analytical models is to understand the underlying effects and
to make comparisons with the DESSIS simulations (referred
to as the “full simulations”).

50 MHz readout frequency.

operates with a negligible CTI above 3 V and has a large CTI
below 1 V. Also the CTI grows with temperature.

Examination of snapshots of electron density plots produced
by DESSIS during a simulation run conﬁrm that electrons leak
out of the main charge packet during transfer at reduced clock
voltages leading to an even distribution of electrons under all
of the gates.

C. 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV traps

This CTI study, at nominal clock voltage, focuses only
on the bulk traps with energies 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV below
the bottom of the conduction band. These will be referred
to simply as the 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV traps. An incident
particle with sufﬁcient energy is able to displace an atom
from its lattice point leading eventually to a stable defect.
These defects manifest themselves as energy levels between
the conduction and valence band, in this case the energy
levels 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV; hence electrons and/or holes may
be captured by these levels. The 0.17 eV trap is an oxygen
vacancy defect, referred to as an A-centre defect. The 0.44 eV
trap is a phosphorus-vacancy defect—an E-centre defect—that
is, a result of the silicon being doped with phosphorus and a
vacancy manifesting from the displacement of a silicon atom
bonded with the phosphorus atom [2].

In order to determine the trap densities for use in simula-
tions, a literature search on possible ILC radiation backgrounds
and trap induction rates in silicon was undertaken. The main
expected background arises from e+e− pairs with an average
energy of 10 MeV and from neutrons (knocked out of nuclei
by synchrotron radiation).

Table 1 shows results of background simulations of e+e−
pairs generation for three proposed vertex detector designs
(from three ILC detector concepts).

A. Simple CTI Model

Firstly, a simple analytical model is considered, based upon
a single trapping level—a so-called Simple CTI model. This
is signiﬁcantly faster than a full simulation. It also provides a
simple method to see the effect of changing parameters and
demonstrates physics understanding.

The charge transfer process is modelled by a differential
equation in terms of the different time constants and temper-
ature dependence of the electron capture and emission pro-
cesses. In the electron capture process, electrons are captured
from the signal packet and each captured electron ﬁlls a trap.
This occurs at the capture rate τc. The electron emission
process is described by the emission of captured electrons from
ﬁlled traps back to the conduction band, and into a second
signal packet at the emission rate τe.

1) Capture and emission time constants: The Shockley-
Read-Hall theory [22] considers a defect at an energy Et below
the bottom of the conduction band, Ec, and gives

where:

• σe = electron capture cross-section
• χe = entropy change factor by electron emission
• νth = electron thermal velocity
• Nc = density of states in the conduction band
• kB = Boltzmann’s constant
• T = absolute temperature
• ns = density of signal charge packet.

It is assumed that χe = 1.

At low temperatures, the emission time constant τe can
be very large and of the order of seconds. The charge shift
time is of the order of nanoseconds. A larger τe means that
a trap remains ﬁlled for much longer than the charge shift
time. Further trapping of signal electrons is not possible and,
consequently, CTI is small at low temperatures. A peak occurs
between low and high temperatures because the CTI is also
small at high temperatures. This manifests itself because, at
high temperatures, the emission time constant decreases to
become comparable to the charge shift time. Now, trapped
electrons rejoin their signal packet.

2) Charge Transfer Equation: From the fraction of ﬁlled

traps, the following differential equation can be derived:

where rf (t) is the time-dependent fraction of ﬁlled traps

where rf (0) is the fraction of ﬁlled traps after a mean waiting
time, tw, the differential equation can be solved to provide an
expression for the CTI:

(cid:17)

where tsh is the shift-time. For one gate, tsh = 1/(3f), where
f is the readout frequency.

This deﬁnition is for CTI for a single trap level. The factor
of three appears since there is a sum over the three gates that
make up a pixel.

3) Matching the CTI deﬁnition of

the simulation: The
Simple Model has been adapted by including initially ﬁlled
traps and by the incorporation of a so-called P factor to CTI:

P = e

−tsh/τe + e

−2tsh/τe + e

−3tsh/τe

(12)

This models the situation where the trapped charge under gate
5 started to empty at time t minus three shift-times, that under
gate 6 at t minus two shift-times and that under gate 7 at t
minus one shift-time. An alternative factor, called P ′, has also
been used to compare with simulated data. This is deﬁned as:

′

P

= 1 + e

−tsh/τe + e

−2tsh/τe

(13)

and models the situation one shift-time earlier than for P .

B. Improved Model

The second analytical model that has been developed is
referred to as the Improved Model (IM), based on the work
of T. Hardy et al. [23]. It is improved by adjusting initial
assumptions to ﬁt the study of CCD58. The Improved model
also considers the effect of a single trapping level, but only
includes the emission time in its differential equation:

dnt
dt

= − nt
τe

(14)

where nt is the density of ﬁlled traps. The traps are initially
ﬁlled for this model and τc ≪ tsh. Nevertheless,
to be
consistent with the full DESSIS simulations (that use partially
ﬁlled traps) the Improved Model uses a time constant between
the ﬁlling of the traps such that the traps remain partially ﬁlled
when the new electron packet passes through the CCD. The
solution of this differential equation leads to another estimator
of the CTI:

• nt(t) = density of traps ﬁlled by electrons
• Nt = density of traps

Considering that the traps are partially ﬁlled and using the
initial condition:

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS

The CTI dependence on temperature and readout frequency

was explored using ISE-TCAD simulations.

1) 0.17 eV traps: Figure 5 shows the CTI for simulations
with partially ﬁlled 0.17 eV traps at different frequencies for
temperatures between 123 K and 260 K, with a nominal clock
voltage of 7 V.

5

2) 0.44 eV traps: Simulations were also carried out with
partially ﬁlled 0.44 eV traps at
temperatures ranging from
250 K to 500 K. This is because previous studies [5] on 0.44 eV
traps have shown that these traps cause only a negligible CTI
at temperatures lower than 250 K due to the long emission
time and thus traps remain fully ﬁlled at lower temperatures.
The results are depicted in Fig. 6.

The peak CTI is higher for lower frequencies with little

temperature dependence of the peak position.

3) 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV traps together: The logarithmic
scale view (Fig. 7) of the simulation results at the different
frequencies and trap energies clearly identiﬁes an optimal
operating temperature of about 250 K.

clocking frequencies 7, 25 and 50 MHz.

CTI values for simulations with 0.44 eV partially ﬁlled traps at

A peak structure can be seen. For 50 MHz, the peak is at
150 K with a CTI of 27.2×10−5. The peak CTI is in the region
between 145 K and 150 K for a 25 MHz clock frequency and
with a value of about 43×10−5. This is about 1.6 times bigger
than the charge transfer inefﬁciency at 50 MHz. The peak CTI
for 7 MHz occurs at about 142 K, with a maximum value of
about 81 × 10−5, an increase from the peak CTI at 50 MHz
(27 × 10−5) by a factor of about 3 and an increase from
the peak CTI at 25 MHz (43 × 10−5) by a factor of nearly 2.
Thus CTI increases as frequency decreases. For higher readout
frequency there is less time to trap the charge, thus the CTI
is reduced. At high temperatures the emission time is so short
that trapped charges rejoin the passing signal.

to overcompensate for the deﬁciencies and the P ′ factor gives
a reasonable but not perfect agreement.

Figure 9 compares the full DESSIS simulation for 0.17 eV
and 0.44 eV traps and clocking frequency of 50 MHz to the
Improved Model. It emphasises the good agreement between
the model and full simulations at temperatures lower than
250 K with 0.17 eV traps, but shows a disagreement at higher
temperatures for the 0.44 eV traps.

traps at clocking frequency 50 MHz. Comparison of Improved Model (IM)
with full DESSIS simulation.

If the 0.44 eV trap electron capture cross-section in the
Improved Model is increased to 10−14 cm2, a somewhat better
agreement is found, as shown in Figure 10. However it is clear
that there are limitations with the Improved Model. They could
relate to a breakdown of the assumptions at high temperatures,
to ignoring the precise form of the clock voltage waveform, or
to ignoring the pixel edge effects. Further studies are required.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The Charge Transfer Inefﬁciency (CTI) of a CCD device
has been studied with a full simulation (ISE-TCAD DESSIS)
and compared with analytical models.

Partially ﬁlled traps from the 0.17 eV and 0.44 eV trap levels
have been implemented in the full simulation and variations of
the CTI with respect to temperature and frequency have been
analysed. The results conﬁrm the dependence of CTI with the
readout frequency. At low temperatures (< 250 K) the 0.17 eV
traps dominate the CTI, whereas the 0.44 eV traps dominate
at higher temperatures.

A large emission time constant τe results in a trap remaining
ﬁlled for much longer than the charge shift time. Further
trapping of signal electrons is not possible so the CTI is small
at low temperatures. At high temperatures the emission time
constant decreases to become comparable to the charge shift
time. Trapped electrons rejoin their signal packet and, because
most are emitted during the charge transfer time, there is
again a small CTI. For intermediate temperatures, a clear peak
structure is observed.

Good agreement between simulations and a so-called Im-
proved Model has been found for 0.17 eV traps but not for
0.44 eV traps. This shows the limitations of the Improved
Model with respect to the full simulation.

The optimum operating temperature for CCD58 in a high

radiation environment is found to be about 250 K.

Interest is now moving to alternative CCD designs, partic-
ularly 2-phase column-parallel readout devices. The extensive
amount of research that has been carried out on CCD58
contributes to the development of future CCD designs.

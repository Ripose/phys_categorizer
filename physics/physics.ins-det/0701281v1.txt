Abstract

A Ring Imaging ˇCerenkov detector built for the BRAHMS experiment at the
Brookhaven RHIC is described. This detector has a high index of refraction gas ra-
diator. ˇCerenkov light is focused on a photo-multiplier based photon detector with
a large spherical mirror. The combination of momentum and ring radius measure-
ment provides particle identiﬁcation from 2.5 GeV/c up to 35 GeV/c for pions and
kaons and well above 40 GeV/c for protons during runs that had the radiator index
of refraction set at n

1 = 1700

1 Introduction

The BRAHMS (Broad RAnge Hadron
Magnetic Spectrometers) Collabo-
ration is one of the four heavy ion
experiments
running currently at
the Brookhaven RHIC. This experi-
ment was designed to study particle
production from colliding systems as
varied as p+p, d+Au and Au+Au in
a wide rapidity range that extends
from 0 to 4 units of rapidity ( max-
imum beam rapidity: 5.4 ) These
measurements are primarily based
on the extraction of inclusive trans-
verse momentum distributions of
fully identiﬁed particles with moder-
ate reach in transverse momentum.

Particle identiﬁcation at momenta
lower than 7 GeV/c is done via
the time-of-ﬂight technique and the
more challenging task of identifying
high momentum particles (up and
above 30 GeV/c) is tackled with a
photo-multiplier based Ring Imaging
ˇCerenkov detector (RICH) described
in the present paper. This detector
is the last element of a two section,
movable spectrometer called For-
ward Spectrometer (FS). This spec-
trometer was designed to measure
high momentum charged particles at
angles with respect to the colliding
beams that range from 30 to 2.3◦.
Tracking and momentum measure-
ment is done with four dipole mag-
nets, two TPCs in the ﬁrst section of

can be high, and three drift chamber
modules in the back section where
lower occupancy and higher resolu-
tion provide precise measurement of
momentum.

The BRAHMS RICH shown in Fig.
1 has a nominal radiator length of
150cm, and a 55cm
70cm spher-
ical mirror with a radius R = 3m.
The mirror was manufactured as a
slump formed glass substrate later
polished to best commercial mirror
surface quality. The polished surface
was coated with Al and a protective
layer of SiO. The mirror is rotated
by 8◦ to keep the photon detector out
of the spectrometer acceptance. The
photon detector is a photo-multiplier
(PMT) based system described in
section 3. This array of PMTs is
placed on the focal plane of the ro-
tated mirror. More details about the
BRAHMS experimental setup can
be found in [1].

2 Design and construction

ˇCerenkov light is a particular form
of energy loss present whenever a
charged particle moves through the
bulk of a medium and its velocity is
higher than the velocity of light in
the medium c/n; this emitted light
appears as a conical “retarded wake”
of light that follows the particle.

The energy loss associated to ˇCerenkov
light emission is evaluated at dis-
tances much greater than the typical
atomic lengths of the material and
it appears as radiated photons of
frequency ω whenever the velocity
of the particle β attains values such
that the dielectric constant of the
material ǫ(ω) and the particle veloc-
ity satisfy the relation β2ǫ(ω) > 1
see REf. [2]. The energy radiated per
unit length is known as the Frank-
Tamm relation:

)dω

Zǫ(ω)> 1
β2

The integrand between brackets is
equal to sin2(θ) where θ is the angle
of the emitted photon with respect
to the particle velocity. From these
relations it is possible to extract an
estimate of the amount of light gen-
erated in a particular detector. The
fact that ˇCerenkov light emission
does not depend on a microscopic
description of the medium implies
that the emission is coherent, and
it is another quantum eﬀect visible
in macroscopic systems. The index

of refraction of the radiator medium
written as: n =
ǫ(ω) can be mea-
sured for the frequencies of interest.
q
A set of such measurements can be
found in [3] and [4].

The conical wave of ˇCerenkov light is
transformed into a plane wave by re-
ﬂection on a spherical mirror. If the
angles of incidence to the mirror are
small, all photons with the same an-
gle of incidence are reﬂected onto a
point on the focal plane, (located at
R/2 where R is the radius of the mir-
ror) and as ˇCerenkov light is emitted
uniformly in the azimuthal angle φ
(deﬁned with respect to the particle
velocity), the focus of ˇCerenkov light
reﬂected by an spherical mirror is a
ring centered around a point related
to the angle of incidence of the par-
ticle with respect to the axis of the
mirror. Within the approximation of
small angles, an spherical mirror fo-
cusing ˇCerenkov light on a photon de-
tector placed on its focal plane mea-
sures the charged particles angle of
incidence and their velocity.

The number of photon-electrons orig-
inating from a path of length L in the
radiator volume is written as:

Ndetected = N0L sin2(θ)

where N0 (in units of (cm)−1 ) con-
tains all the detector parameters:

N0 = 370εmτquatzfdet

set as

QP M T is the quantum eﬃciency of
the photomultiplier photo cathode.
The PMTs used in the BRAHMS
RICH have borosilicate windows
that set their quantum eﬃciency
QP M T lower wave length cutoﬀ at
250 nm and bialkali photocathodes
with a maximum in eﬃciency of 20%.
The calculated integral of QP M T for
these PMTs is equal to 0.33 eV. A
fraction of the light, estimated to be
equal to 9.7%, is lost when the pho-
tons traverse the 2.5 cm thick quartz
window. The transmission of that
window τquartz is thus set to 0.90. Fi-
nally the photon detector has dead
areas between PMTs that amount
to an ﬁducial term fdet equal to 0.7.
The expected ﬁgure of merit of the
BRAHMS RICH is then equal to:
N0 = 69 cm−1.

The focused light doesn’t form a per-
fect ring, chromatic and geometrical
aberrations will distort it. The posi-
tion resolution of the photon detector
will also contribute to the spread of
the photons away from a perfect cir-
cle. The angular or radial resolution
of a Ring Imaging ˇCerenkov detector
is critical at high values of momen-
tum where the bands of radius ver-
sus momentum for diﬀerent particles
begin to merge. The width of these
bands sets the particle discrimination
power. As mentioned above, the res-
olution of the detector will be writ-
ten as the sum in quadrature of the
chromatic aberrations and the single
hit radius resolution contribution:

The contribution from chromatic
aberrations (∆r/r)chromatic is present
because the index of refraction in
a dielectric depends on the fre-
quency of the electromagnetic wave
ǫ(ω). Photons of diﬀerent
as n =
energy focus at diﬀerent radii. For
a particular detector sensitive to a
ﬁnite band of wave lengths, the con-
tribution of this distortion to the
resolution of the detector can be
simpliﬁed at high momentum values

∆n in these relations is set by the dy-

RICH the photon detector is an array
of multianode photo-multipliers with
a FWHM quantum eﬃciency equal to
2.7 eV (from 250nm to 517nm). The
radiator is a mixture of two heavy
ﬂuorocarbon gases C4F10 and C5F12
from 3M [5].

The index of refraction of the gas
mixture was calculated using mea-
surements performed in liquid phase,
[3] and the Lorentz-Lorenz equation.

To estimate the overall eﬀect of the
geometrical aberrations we have sim-

ulated the geometry of the detector
and ray traced all ˇCerenkov pho-
tons produced by charged pions with
ﬁxed momentum set to 19 GeV/c.
Two cases are considered, in the ﬁrst
one, a set of pions move all along
the axis of symmetry of the detector.
The deviation from a perfect ring is
shown in the a and b panels of Fig 2.
Panel a shows the distribution of the
distance between the photon inter-
section with the detector plane and
a nominal center of the ring. The az-
imuthal dependence of the deviation
from a perfect ring (for pions at 19
GeV/c and n
1 = 1960 ppm) is
shown in panel b. These deviations
are all the result of the 9 degree ro-
tation of the spherical mirror and
the diﬀerent positions of the emitted
ˇCerenkov photons along the track
of the charged pion. The photons
with the smallest deviations are the
ones emitted close to the mirror. The
overall eﬀect of mirror rotation and
photon emission position is small
and transforms the rings into ellipses
with the big axis along the x axis of
the photon detector.

A second set of charged pions with
the same ﬁxed momentum was used
to extract an overall eﬀect from ge-
ometrical aberrations. This time the
tracks belong to detected particles
and give us the most realistic distri-
butions in slopes and intersections
with the radiator volume. The result
of ray tracing the Cherenkov photons
from this second set of pions is shown
in panels c and d of Fig. 2. The an-
gles of incidence into the RICH are
small, the most distorted rings are
produced by charged particles that
ﬂy close to the edges of the radiator

ometrical aberrations. For both sets of
pions, the left panel shows the distribu-

volume. We can thus quote a max-
imum value for geometrical aberra-
tions as (∆r/r)geometric = 0.025 even
though the majority of the rings are
contained in the bright band of panel
d that corresponds to 0.7% Once a
particle is identiﬁed it is posible to
correct the geometrical aberrations
in an iterative way. The present anal-
ysis does not include this correction.

A prototype of this detector was
tested in one of the experimental
halls at the BNL AGS. These stud-
ies aimed at developing a photo-
multiplier based photon detector
in collaboration with Hamamatsu

5

×

Corp. From an earlier PMT version
with 256 pixels that provided the
ﬁrst rings, the development work
continued to reduce the amount of
charge shared between neighboring
pixels. The second PMT version had
1cm2 pixel arranged in a 10X10
100
matrix. This device included an ad-
ditional focusing stage between cath-
ode and ﬁrst dynode reducing the
charge spread to 10% at the center of
the next pixel [6], but had poor pulse
height resolution, and was deemed
too diﬃcult to manufacture. Finally
we tested the R5900 four pixel PMT
mounted in a compact metallic can.
In order to achieve close packing af
these tubes Hamamtsu produced the
R7600 03 M4F that was selected to
be used in this detector. Results ob-
tained with the prototype can be
found in Refs. [6] and [7].

3 The photon detector

The photon detector is an array of 80
four-pixel photomultipliers R7600-
03-M4F [8]. Each PMT has a single
photocathode plane evaporated on a
borosilicate window. Eleven dynodes
amplify the electron extracted from
the cathode and the total charge is
collected in four independent anode
plates. A focusing stage is placed
between cathode and dynodes to
reduced the charge shared between
anodes. The complete system is en-
cased in a ﬂange-less metallic can
held at the cathode voltage.

Close packing of these PMTs was
achieved by Hamamatsu engineers
with the design of a matrix of 5 x

4 biasing bases and sockets. Each
matrix has two high voltage con-
nections such that a single channel
of a HV power supply can bias ten
PMTs. The photo-multipliers placed
in these matrices were selected to
have similar gains and pulse height
from each
resolutions. The signal
anode is routed out of each matrix
through RG17 cables. The complete
photon detector consists of four PMT
matrices, and 70% of the total area
is covered by active pixels.

The output of these PMTs is fast and
has suﬃcient pulse height resolution,
(in average the single photo-electron
peak appears as a shoulder of the
distribution) but their gain is insuf-
ﬁcient to send the signal through
some 100 meters of cable (RG58) to
be integrated in an ADC with 50 fC
coulomb resolution. This shortcom-
ing of the PMT was compensated by
the addition of one stage of ampliﬁ-
cation mounted right on the matrices
of PMT bases. Fast charge ampli-
ﬁers were AC coupled to the anode
output through impedance match-
ing 24Ω resistors to ground and a
0.1µf capacitor. Fig. 3 shows one of
the bias array with the ﬁve ampliﬁer
cards connected to it.

The response of the R7600 PMTs
was studied with a well collimated
LED positioned in front of the photo-
cathode with a two axis stepping
motor system set to move in steps
of 1 mm. The amount of light pro-
duced with green LED is constant
during the duration of the scan of
one photo-multiplier and can thus
be used to study the position depen-
dence of the response of a particular

6

pixel. As the LED is 1 mm into the
neighboring pixel it has 20% of the
average pulse height in the center.
Two mm further away that fraction
drops to
6% and is negligible at
the center of the next pixel.

∼

The 320 signal cables are connected
to a LeCroy 1885F Fastbus ADC af-
ter suitable delay to allow for a trig-
ger deﬁnition for each RHIC collision.
The charge on each channel was inte-
grated during a gate that lasted 120
ns.

C5F12 was introduced till the pres-
sure reached 392 Torr (or 41.3% of
the ﬁnal mixture pressure of 1.25 at-
mospheres). After that, C4F10 is sent
into the radiator volume till the ﬁnal
mixture pressure is reached. Once
the ﬁlling is done, a small sample of
the gas was used to measure the in-
dex of refraction by counting fringes
in a Young interferometer as one of
the split beams of laser light goes
through a volume that is ﬁlling with
the gas sample, and the other passes
through an equal length of vacuum.

Fig. 4 displays a portion of the fringes
detected with a PIN diode to convey
their good deﬁnition that makes pos-
sible to make measurement of the in-
dex of refraction with a resolution of
one part in a million.

4 Filling procedure.

Work performed on the prototype
detector proved that the only ﬁlling
procedure that guaranties the high-
est concentration of the gas mixture
in the radiator volume is the one
that starts by evacuating the vol-
ume. The drawback of this method
is the need of a vessel designed to
withstand a full atmosphere pres-
sure diﬀerential. Once the radiator
volume was evacuated, a boil oﬀ of

5 Data analysis

Tracks reconstructed with the FS
tracking system are
spectrometer
used to ﬁnd the nominal center of
rings. In case there are several tracks
in the event, the loop over tracks is
ordered such that it starts with the
one with the highest momentum.
Once a ring center is deﬁned, the dis-
tance from pixel center to ring center
is calculated for all pixels that have
charge above pedestal. The radius of
a ring candidate is set as the average
of those distances. The set of pixels
is accepted as a ring if their number
exceeds a minimum set by default
to be equal to 4 and is at least 40%
of an estimated number of photo-
electrons with a ﬁgure of merit set
low as N0 = 55.

Pixels that were included in the his-
togram are marked and will not be
used in the search for another ring in
events where there is more than one
track in the RICH. A more detailed
description of this algorithm can be
found in [9].

Particle identiﬁcation with the RICH
detector can be done with two inde-
pendent and consistent methods, the
ﬁrst one is based on the diﬀerence
between measured ring radii and the

ence falls within a set number of stan-
dard deviations the measured parti-

cle identity is set to be the one of the
candidate particle. This method re-
quires the correct value of the index
of refraction of the radiator gas ex-
tracted previously from the data and
stored in a run information database.
This method includes tools described
in section 6.2 to handle high momen-
tum particles whenever the pion and
kaon band start to overlap. The sec-
ond particle identiﬁcation method is
based on the calculated mass using
the momentum of the particle, the ra-
dius of the ˇCerenkov ring and the in-
dex of refraction of the radiator. The
resolution of this calculated mass is
momentum dependent and has con-
tributions from the momentum reso-
lution as well as the radius resolution.

squared as a function of momentum.

the γ factor at the particle threshold.

6.2 Particle identiﬁcation at high

momentum

∼

Fig. 6 shows that kaons can be sepa-
rated from pions with simple cuts of
the radius of the rings for momenta
25GeV /c, and that
smaller than
protons are well separated beyond
the momentum range of the ﬁgure.
In order to extend the separation
of kaons and pions to higher val-
ues of momentum it is necessary to
parametrize the uncorrected abun-
dance of kaons and pions in small
momentum bins in order to allocate
probabilities or weights to events
where the kaon band has started
merging with the pion band. That
parametrization was obtained at
each full ﬁeld spectrometer setting
by ﬁtting projections of narrow mo-
mentum bands (500 MeV/c) onto
the radius axis. The functional form
used for these ﬁts was the sum of two
gaussians with equal widths, the free
parameters of the ﬁt were the nor-
malizations, centroids and the com-
mon width. Fig. 10 shows the results
of those ﬁts.

Once the abundance of kaons with re-
spect to pions is know for a particu-
lar full ﬁeld spectrometer it is possi-
ble to assign probabilities to events
that lie in the overlap of the kaon and
pion bands. Fig. 11 shows the sepa-
ration between kaons (blue hatched
histogram centered around 8.1 cm)
and the more abundant pions shown
as the red histogram centered at 8.4
cm) in a wide momentum bin (from
30 to 44.6 GeV/c). Protons are also
present in this ﬁgure but their dis-
tribution is not gaussian because at

7 Conclusion

The BRAHMS RICH described here
has performed very well throughout
the six years of data collection at
RHIC. Its extended particle identiﬁ-
cation range has been instrumental
in the study of particle production
at high rapidity in several nuclear
system that include p+p, d+Au and
several heavy-ion systems. The high
resolution of the radius measure-
ment together with the simplicity
of the photo-multiplier based pho-
ton detector have made this detector
the most important tool among the
other particle identiﬁcation counters
in the BRAHMS setup.

We are greatful to the members of
the BRAHMS Collaboration whose
participation made this work pos-
sible, special thanks to F. Videbæk
and Ch. Chasman for their help and
valuable suggestions. This work was
supported by the Oﬃce of Nuclear
Physics of the U.S. Department of
Energy,
the Danish Natural Sci-
ence Research Council, the Research
Council of Norway, the Polish State
Committee for Scientiﬁc Research
(KBN) and the Romanian Ministry
of Research.

that particle discrimination between
kaons and pions is still possible even
though their radius versus momentum
bands start to overlap, the assignment
of probabilities is described in the text.

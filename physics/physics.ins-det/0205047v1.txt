AN UNEXPECTED EFFECT IN ALEPH: LONG-TERM DISPLACEMENT OF
THE SILICON VERTEX DETECTOR

Giacomo Sguazzoni
European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), CH–1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland

The ALEPH Silicon Vertex Detector for LEP2 featured a laser survey system to monitor its
mechanical stability. The analysis of laser system data from 1997 to 2000 showed that VDET
suﬀered a time-dependent displacement. It resulted to be compatible with a deformation of the
support structure that made the device to slowly rotate during the data-taking. A maximal
local displacement of ∼20 µm was observed, corresponding to a rotation of ∼10
rad. The
implementation of a time-dependent correction on the alignment by using the laser system
data led to sizeable improvements on the ALEPH data quality.

1 The ALEPH Silicon Vertex Detector

Many physics studies of the high energy phase of LEP (LEP2) relied on powerful heavy-ﬂavour
tags provided by high-resolution vertex detectors.

The ALEPH Silicon Vertex Detector1 (VDET) had an active length of ∼40 cm and consisted
of two concentric cylindrical layers of 144 micro-strip silicon detectors of ∼5.3 cm×6.5 cm with
double-sided readout. The cylinders’ axes coincided with the nominal e+e− beam axes, i.e. the z-
axis in the ALEPH reference system. Six silicon detectors were glued together and instrumented
with readout electronics to form the VDET elementary unit (face). The inner layer (∼6.3 cm
radius) was formed by 9 faces, the outer layer (∼10.5 cm radius) consisted of 15 faces.

2 Laser System

VDET featured a laser survey system2 to monitor its mechanical stability with respect to the
external tracking devices, since an undetected large movement ( >∼ 20 µm) of VDET during the
data-taking could have degraded signiﬁcantly its performances. The VDET alignment was
normally performed at the beginning of the annual data-taking with events collected during a
dedicated calibration run at the Z resonance peak. Afterwards the reduced event rate of LEP2

energies did not allow a precise survey to be done by using particle tracks, and the laser system
thus played a crucial role in monitoring the stability of the device.

The system made use of infrared light (λ = 904 nm) from two pulsed laser diodes with an
output power of 6 W each and a pulse length of 50 ns. The light was distributed via optical
ﬁbers to prisms and lenses attached to the inner wall of the Inner Tracking Chamber (ITC, the
closest outer detector). The lenses focused several light beams on 14 of the 15 VDET outer faces.
Information on the VDET displacements with respect to the ITC were obtained by monitoring
the laser beam impact position (spot) on the silicon wafers. All laser beams were nominally
parallel to the (xy)-plane. As shown in Fig. 1a and in Fig. 1b, there were normally three spots
per face: the ones close to the face ends had the beam direction normal to the silicon surface;
the one placed about in the middle had the beam direction at ∼45◦ with respect to the silicon
surface, in order to be also sensitive to displacements normal to the face.

The system was operating during standard data-taking: the lasers were ﬁred approximately
every ∼100 physics triggers (i.e. once per one to two minutes) and the spots were reconstructed
as standard particle hits. The spot position resolution was impressive, typically ∼0.5–1.5 µm,
thanks to the large signal and the cluster width extending over more than one readout strip.
After the installation ﬁve spots out of 44 were missed, probably due to misalignment or breakage
of the optics. The number of collected laser events was 62k in 1997, 129k in 1998, 125k in 1999,
and 170k in 2000.

3 Analysis of Laser System Data

The analysis of the laser system data consisted in studying the time dependence of the spot
positions. Along with the expected short-term displacements due to temperature eﬀects3, a
long-term dependence was discovered in (rφ)-spot positions since 1997. As an example, this
behaviour over the entire data-taking period in 2000 is shown in Fig. 2a and in Fig. 2b, referring
to endcap A (z < 0) and endcap B (z > 0) spots, respectively. Some time-chart is not present
because the corresponding spot was missing or removed from the analysis because of low quality3.
The size of the (rφ)-displacements was systematically dependent on the face azimuthal position,
in some case being as large as ∼10–20 µm, thus comparable to the charged track single hit
resolution (∼10 µm). On the contrary, the z-side deviations did not show any critical eﬀect.

The long-term deviations were likely to be due to a global rotation of VDET in the (xy)-
plane, as suggested by the distinctive geometrical conﬁguration. The deviations were thus
parametrized under the assumption that VDET was moving as a rigid body, i.e. by using three

parameters to correct the nominal alignment: the x-translation, the y-translation and the rota-
tion angle around the z-axis. These were extracted by a ﬁt procedure. As an example, Fig. 2c
reports the parameters relative to year 2000 plotted as a function of the time from the begin-
ning of the data-taking. A pictorial view of the corresponding VDET displacement is shown in
Fig. 3a and in Fig. 3b. The reconstructed motion was consistent with a rotation and the rigid
body model was found to reproduce the observed spot deviations within a few microns3. The
maximum z-rotation value was ∼7·10−5rad in 1997, ∼8·10−5rad in 1998, ∼3·10−5rad in 1999
and ∼9·10−5rad in 2000.

During the last three years of LEP running, several runs at the Z resonance peak were also
taken for calibration purpose, during and at the end of the data-taking. The standard alignment
performed by using these calibration data allowed to independently conﬁrm the motion of VDET
as extracted from the laser system, deﬁnitely proving its reliability. A time-dependent correction
of the alignment based on the laser data was thus applied from 1998 on.

The correction had a sensible impact on the data quality. This was pointed out studying the
Z calibration runs, where a signiﬁcant amount of data was collected in a period of time much
shorter than the time-scale of the eﬀect under observation. Figure 3c and Fig. 3d shows the
distribution of the sum of the impact parameters of the two muons in Z → µµ events, before
and after applying the laser correction. The plots refer to the Z calibration run taken in 2000,
∼150 days after the beginning of data-taking, when the displacement averaged over all VDET
faces was about ∼10 µm. Without the correction the systematic shift of the distribution is of
the same order of magnitude. Applying the laser correction the mean of the distribution is again
compatible with zero.

The rotation may be explained considering that VDET is supported by ﬂanges which slot
into two long metal rails located at the top and bottom of the ITC inner cylinder. The top ﬂanges
were not metallic as the bottom ones, but made of springy plastic to compensate for distance
variations between the rails along which VDET slided during the installation. The VDET
environmental conditions during running were quite diﬀerent with respect to the shutdown
period, both in terms of temperature and humidity. They probably had some long-term eﬀect
on the material of the plastic ﬂanges, causing a tiny deformation that made VDET to slowly
rotate around the lower rail (represented by the small crosses in Fig. 3a and in Fig. 3b).

As a further indication of the environmental conditions as the possible cause, the deformation
was found to recover during the shutdown. In the 1999–2000 shutdown VDET was not removed
for maintenance allowing its position to be monitored. At the beginning of the data-taking in
2000 the position resulted again the same as at the beginning of the data-taking in 1999.

Extrapolating the LEP experience to the next generation of experiments, the design issues
of the Silicon Tracker devices for LHC turn out to be extremely challenging. The huge scale
involved forces the eﬀects as the one here described to be carefully taken into account. In fact,
as an example, studies for the CMS Tracker support structure have shown that a variation of
environmental humidity may lead to material deformation with very long time-scale4.

4 Conclusions

The laser system of the ALEPH Vertex Detector for LEP2 was a simple but extremely eﬀective
survey system. It allowed a reliable and high-precision monitoring of the VDET position during
the data-taking revealing a tiny long-term rotation. An alignment correction based on the
information from this system was successfully applied.

We describe the oﬄine computing system of the Belle experiment, consisting of a computing farm with one
thousand IA-32 CPUs. Up to now, the Belle experiment has accumulated more than 120 fb−1 of data, which
is the world largest B ¯B sample at the Υ(4S) energy. The data have to be processed with a single version
of reconstruction software and calibration constants to perform precise measurements of B meson decays. In
addition, Monte Carlo samples three times larger than the real beam data are generated. To fullﬁll our computing
needs, we have constructed the computing system with 90(300) quad(dual) CPU PC servers from multiple
vendors as a central processing system. The details of this computing system and performance of data processing
with the current model are presented.

1. Belle Experiment

The Belle experiment[1]

is the KEK B-factory
project with an asymmetric e+e− collision to explore
CP violation in B meson system. The data-taking
stared from June 1999, and the accelerator( KEKB
)[2] gradually improved its performance. The inte-
grated luminosity logged by the Belle detector has
reached 120 fb−1 in March 2003. This corresponds
to the fact that more than 120 M B ¯B pairs have been
recorded in our tape storage. This is obviously the
largest B ¯B data sample at the Υ(4S) energy region
in the world.

The KEKB accelerator is still updating their lu-
minosity records thanks to excellent operations. The
integrated luminosity per day has been approaching
500 pb−1.

From the computing model’s point of view, a large
data sample is a challenging issue for CPU power as
well as for storage.

In daily event processing, we have to process beam
data without any delay for online data acquisition. To
do so, we need enough CPU power and a stable DST
production.

Furthermore, we have to reprocess the entire data
sample whenever we have a major update of recon-
struction codes as well as calibration constants. Here,
the whole event data have to be reconstructed from
rawdata using the same version of the codes and con-
stants to controll the systematic errors in user analy-
ses.

Considering the large amount of accumulated beam
data, it is unrealistic for users to make their analyses
in an eﬃcient way using the whole data sets. Thus,
the BELLE data processing also incorporates the data
skimming, leading to reduced data ﬁles based on a ﬁrst
event selection and called physics skims.

For the Monte Carlo( MC ) data, we require large
amount of statistics, at least 3 times larger than beam
data to evaluate systematic eﬀect related to the detec-
tor acceptance, event reconstruction and so on.

MODT010

In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce the BELLE com-
puting software(section 2) and system(section 3) in-
cluding PC farms and its upgrade(section 4). Then,
in section 5, we will explain the scheme of the DST
production/reprocessing and mention how MC events
have been produced(section 6). Finally summary and
future plan will be given.

2. Software Tools

We describe here the core software of event process-

ing which is based on “home-made” tools.

2.1. B.A.S.F. Framework

B.A.S.F.( Belle AnalySis Framework ) is a unique
framework for us from DAQ to ﬁnal user analyses.
It is composed by a set of modules written in C++,
each one having at least the following structure: a
beginning of run, an event processing and an end of
run function. Histograming is also included in the
structure of modules. These modules are compiled as
shared objects and are dynamically plugged in when
B.A.S.F. runs as shown in Figure 1. This framework
utilizes event-by-event parallel processing on SMP us-
ing a fork function.

2.2. Data Management

The data transfer between modules and I/O is man-
aged by PANTHER. This is based upon a bank sys-
tem composed of tables. The contents of tables are
deﬁned in ASCII format before loading modules and
user has to include this ﬁle in the code as header ﬁles.
In each tables, one can pick up any value correspond-
ing to each attribute and pointer which relates one
table to the other. This contains compression capa-
bility using zlib utility. PANTHER is only a data
management system in the Belle experiment. From

2

rawdata to user analyses, any stage of events can be
consistently handled only with PANTHER.

The typical event size is 35 KB for rawdata and for
60 KB for reconstructed DST data. The DST data
contains a lot of information of results from each de-
tector analyses. The quantity of information stored
in these DST ﬁles is usually too large for a standard
physics analysis. To reduce the data size, we produce
compact format of the DST data(“mini-DST”), where
the size is 12 KB per hadronic event.

2.3. Reconstruction Library and
Simulation

The detector calibration constants, used to process
data, are stored in a PostgreSQL[4] database. At
KEK, we have two database servers and one is mir-
rored to the other.
In each institution, there is a
database server of which the substance is periodically
imported from the KEK main server.

The event ﬂow of DST production is schematically
shown in Figure 1. Each step like calibration and un-
packing is performed by a set of modules which are
loaded on the B.A.S.F. platform. The reconstructed
data are transfered in the PANTHER format between
diﬀerent modules. At the end, the data are com-
pressed.

The update of the library is usually done a couple
of times in a year. In the last year, we had a major
update in April, where the tracking software for low
momentum region was improved. Once a new library
is released, all events taken so far are again processed(
reprocessing ) from rawdata in order to produce new
DST and mini-DST ﬁle.

The

simulation is performed with GEANT3
packages[3] by adding an interface to B.A.S.F. Then,
MC data follow the same treatment as the real data,
including the detector calibration constants database.
For every signiﬁcant library changes, as in spring 2002,
the MC data samples are generated using the same
version of BASF library than real data.

3. Belle Computing System

Figure 2 is an overview of our computing system
which consists of the three principal networks. The
ﬁrst one is connected between computing servers for
batch jobs and the PC farms( described in the next
section ) for DST/MC productions. This system is
composed of 38 Sun hosts as computing machines
linked to PC farms via a gigabit ethernet switch(
“computing network” ). These Sun hosts are oper-
ated under the LSF batch qeueing utility. 20 Sun
hosts out of 38 are equipped with 2 DTF2 tape drives
each and are connected to the SONY tape robotic li-
brary of 500 TB capacity. The PC farms are used for

the DST/MC productions. Rawdata from the Belle
detector are sent to an online tape server linked to
the tape drives, by which rawdata are written onto a
DTF2 tape.

The second network is used for user analyses and
data storage system. The 9 work group servers are
connected to a swiching device of a gigabit ehternet
called “internal network”. The hierarchy mass stor-
age( 120 TB capacity ) with the 4 TB staging disk in
addition to the 8 TB ﬁle servers are also connected.
The other network switch( “user network” ) links be-
tween the work group servers and 100 user PC’s. Ev-
erybody can use each PC for her/his analysis, or login
to one of the work group servers and analyze data in-
teractively. For the batch system, user can submit
batch jobs to the computing servers from the work
group servers. The CPU’s are summarised in Table I.

4. PC Farms

Two requirements on our computing system in or-

der to achieve physics goal are addressed:

• Whole beam data have to be reprocessed with
a single version of the reconstruction code and
constants to provide a consistent dataset. Our
aim is to do it within three months, which en-
ables us to obtain physics results promptly.

• Quantity of MC sample to be used for data anal-
yses must be at least 3 times larger than that of
beam data size. We need this requirement, for
instance, to study the systematic errors.

MODT010

To satisfy these requirements, we have added more
PC farms in our computing model described in the
previous section and boosted up CPU power for the
DST/MC production. Figure 3 shows total CPU of
the PC farms installed in the system as a function
of time, where a vertical axis represents CPU power
in unit of GHz, which is estimated as a product of
processor speed, # of processors and # of PC nodes.
We have started purchasing PC farms since June 1999.
Then, PC farms have been gradually installed as we
accumulated more integrated luminosity.

Table II summarises our PC farms. As we can seen,
our system is heterogeneous from various vendors. In
total, CPU power of 1508GHz is equipped in our sys-
tem.

In all PC farms, RedHat linux systems of version 6
or 7[5] have been installed and all of Belle utilities are
implemented.

5. DST Production and Reprocessing

A schematic drawing of the production scheme is
shown in Figure 4. The ﬁrst step( “production” ) is
performed in the following way. One of the comput-
ing servers of Sun hosts is employed as a tape server,
where two DTF2 tapes, one for rawdata and the other
for DST data, are mounted. Rawdata stored in a
DTF2 tape is read on the tape server and these data

are distributed over all hosts in the PC farm, in which
the event processing is performed. After the event re-
construction, the processed data are sent back to the
tape server and they are recorded in the output tape
as DST.

In the next step(“skimming”), the DST tape is read
at the diﬀerent tape server and, based upon event
classiﬁcation criteria they are categorized into several
physics skims. Then, only events of our interest are
written onto disks. These output skims are starting
point of individual analyses.

For the reprocessing, one remarkable feature in the
skimming stage is that it is possible to write the out-

put data onto a disk located outside KEK. For in-
stance, we can use a disk at Nagoya, 350 km away
from KEK. This disk is mounted to the ﬁle server us-
ing NFS via the gigabit network of SuperSINET[6].

The performace of the reprocessing we have done
since 2001 is shown in Figure 5. In 2001, the ﬁrst turn-
around of the reprocessing has started in April after
all of the reconstruction programmes together with
calibration constants had been ﬁxed. The whole data

6. MC Production

The MC data consists of 3 type of physics events of

B0 ¯B0, B+B− and continuum.

We produce these MC data using the real beam con-
ditions, like beam pipe background and interaction
point(IP) position. These conditions depending on
the run number, we called this procedure a “run-by-
run” production of MC data. Moreover, as it was al-
ready mentionned, we generate MC data with 3 times
larger statistics than real data.

Figure 6 represents how we have produced MC
events in 2002. Major update of the simulation and
reconstruction software was done in April, and since
then we have started the MC production.
In Octo-
ber, a minor change of the simulation code in order
to match to the modiﬁcation of the beam triggering
scheme was made.

The PC farms were shared between the DST and
the MC production and the allocation of the CPU
power can be easily modiﬁed according to the situa-
tion.

For the MC production, the computing resources
at remote sites have been actively used. The upper
Figure 7 indicates that total CPU power at remote
sites is about 300 GHz. This is comparable to that
of KEK availble for the MC production. The MC
events produced outside KEK amounts to 44 % of all
of events produced(shown in Figure 7). These MC
data are basically sent to KEK via network and are
saved in the disk. In case that the disk does not have
enough space, MC events were copied onto DTF2 tape
instead. The MC data tapes are released in the tape
library and then user can access these data in batch
jobs. The typical size corresponds to around 6 TB in
6-months MC production. More remote institutions
are expected to join in producing the MC events this

of 30 fb−1 has been reprocessed before August and
were used for the analyses for the 2001 summer con-
ferences. The next turn-around was made last year.
The library for the reconstruction has been frozen in
the beginning of April 2002, and the reprocessing has
started again. Here, all of the data taken from 1999
to July 2002 have been reconstructed to produce a
unique and a consistent data set for physics analyses.
As can be seen in the Figure 5, our reprocessing was
successfully done within a couple of months. For re-
processing performed in 2002, compared to 2001 beam
data, the data size is increased by a factor of 2.5, how-
ever the upgraded CPU power by adding PC farms
allows us to reconstruct all the rawdata of 78 fb−1 in
3 months.

The failure rate of the reprocessing is tabulated in
Table III. The main trouble comes from the com-
minication error among PC hosts, where possible im-
provement of the signal handling of each PC could be
expected to reduce this error. However, our total error
rate is still small enough and the whole comuputing
system has been eﬃciently working.

7. Summary and Future Pan

The Belle computing system has been operated in
an eﬃcient way so that we have successfully reprocess
more than 250 fb−1 of real beam data so far. For
the MC data, event samples 3 times larger than beam
data have been produced at KEK and at remote sites.
A higher luminosity B-factory machine at KEK(
superKEKB ) is being proposed as an upgrade plan of
the present experiment[7]. This plan aims to achieving
1035 cm−2sec−1 or more luminosity, corresponding to
a data size of 1 PB for 1-year operation. To handle
this amount of data, we may have to introduce Grid
technology, for instance, for eﬃcient usage of resources
at remote sites. The new computing model for the
superKEKB experiment will be presented in letter of
intent submitted in the end of 2003.

Abstract

The ANTARES neutrino telescope, to be immersed depth in the Mediterranean Sea,
will consist of a 3 dimensional matrix of 900 large area photomultiplier tubes housed
in pressure resistant glass spheres. The selection of the optimal photomultiplier was a
critical step for the project and required an intensive phase of tests and developments
carried out in close collaboration with the main manufacturers worldwide. This
paper provides an overview of the tests performed by the collaboration and describes
in detail the features of the photomultiplier tube chosen for ANTARES.

1 Introduction

The ANTARES collaboration is constructing a neutrino telescope [1] to be
operated at great depth in the Mediterranean Sea. This telescope is a ﬁrst
step towards a full scale km3 detector. To this end, during the last years
many eﬀorts have been put into R&D studies, especially concerning one of the
most crucial components of the detector, the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
The main results of these tests, performed in close collaboration with PMT
manufacturers, are described in this paper.

Section 2 describes the detection principle of a deep-sea neutrino telescope
and the layout of ANTARES. The requirements that the photo-sensitive de-
tectors should satisfy and other relevant PMT characteristics are reviewed in
section 3. These criteria led to the pre-selection of a limited number of PMT
candidates. The results of the main tests performed on these candidates are
given in section 4. In the last section, the main features of the PMT chosen
for ANTARES, the Hamamatsu R7081-20, are summarised. These results are
based on the measurements made on a sample of 912 units purchased and
tested in 2001.

2 Detection principle of a neutrino telescope

High energy muon neutrinos can be detected by observing the long-range
muons produced by neutrino interactions with the matter surrounding the de-
tector [2]. In a transparent medium, such as water or ice, the Cherenkov light
induced by these relativistic muons can be detected by a three-dimensional
array of PMTs. The measurement of the arrival time of the Cherenkov light
at each PMT combined with the knowledge of their positions allows the re-
construction of the muon direction. The number of photons hitting each PMT
gives an estimate of the muon energy.

Though simple in principle, the design of the telescope is limited in practice
by two essential constraints:

• A very large muon ﬂux is naturally produced by cosmic ray interactions with
the Earth’s atmosphere. In order to reduce this background, the neutrino
telescope must be located in the sea (or ice) at a depth of a few kilometres.
Therefore, the PMTs must be housed in a transparent and pressure-resistant
glass sphere. This glass sphere, together with the equipment inside, is called
Optical Module (OM).

• Due to the very low ﬂux of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources
and to the small neutrino interaction cross-section, a large-volume detector
is necessary.

Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the ANTARES telescope. It consists of
12 vertical lines, separated by 60-75 m from each other. Each line is equipped
with 75 OMs, in groups of three forming storeys separated by 14.5 m. The
whole detector is immersed at a depth of 2500 m and connected to the shore
by a 40 km long electro-optical cable.

3 Speciﬁcations for the ANTARES photomultiplier tubes

This section describes the speciﬁcations required for the photomultiplier tubes
used in ANTARES. In order to establish a standard set of measurement pa-
rameters, we require the following conditions during the tests:

- an average light level corresponding to well below one photoelectron is used;
- the high voltage is ﬁxed to HVnom (see below);
- the PMT is shielded against the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld;
- measurements are performed at room temperature (∼20◦C);
- the light source illuminating the photomultiplier should have a wavelength

of about 450 nm;

Fig. 1. The ANTARES detector will consist of 12 lines, about 450 m long, out of
which 350 m are equipped with 75 optical modules grouped in 25 triplets called
storeys.

- the temporal width of the light pulse is lower than 1 ns (FWHM);
- light homogeneously illuminates the photocathode.

• Dimensions

Figure 2 shows a sketch of the ANTARES OM [3]. It consists of a pressure-
resistant glass sphere housing the photomultiplier embedded in silicon gel to
ensure a good optical coupling. A high permittivity alloy cage surrounds the
tube, shielding it against the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Signal outputs and HV
control and monitoring are transmitted through pressure-resistant connec-
tors to and from the outside world. The glass sphere, made of two separate
halves, is closed by applying an inner under-pressure of 200-300 mbar. The
sphere dimension (41.7 cm inner diameter) limits the photocathode diame-
ter to ∼38 cm (15” PMT), and the total PMT length to ∼35 cm.

• Gain

The noise level of the electronic circuit used to digitise the PMT pulse
requires a single photoelectron (SPE) amplitude of the order of 50 mV on a
50 Ω load [4]. This requires the photomultiplier gain to be at least 5 × 107.
The HV value corresponding to this gain will be called nominal voltage,
HVnom, hereafter. The HVnom is not limited in principle, but should remain
small enough (<2000 V) to ensure long term stability and avoid ageing
problems. Experience shows that these requirements restrict the choice to
tubes equipped with at least 10 ampliﬁcation stages, linear focusing or box-
line type.

Fig. 2. Sketch of an ANTARES optical module. A large hemispherical photomulti-
plier (10 inch diameter) is protected by a pressure-resistant glass sphere. The outer
diameter of the sphere is 43.2 cm.

• Peak to valley ratio

For an absolute calibration of the telescope, it is necessary to be able to
properly isolate a single photoelectron from the pedestal. This requires a
peak to valley ratio (P/V) to be at least 2, as computed from the charge
spectrum (see section 4 for details).

• Transit time spread

The muon direction is reconstructed from the arrival time of the Cherenkov
light at each PMT. The relationship between the required muon angular res-
olution and the time resolution has been estimated using a full computer
simulation, taking into account the eﬀect of all timing uncertainties. Con-
sidering that we are aiming at an absolute time calibration better than
σcal = 1 ns, the timing uncertainty due to the jitter of the PMT response
should also remain of the order of 1 ns, in order not to degrade signiﬁcantly
the angular resolution. In the following, the so-called transit time spread
(TTS) will refer to the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the transit
time of the signal in the phototube. This TTS should not exceed 3 ns.

• Signal shape characteristics

In order to be able to separate events which are close in time, the pulse
shape must be stable, non saturated and smooth. Moreover, to improve the
time resolution and the analysis of the PMT signals, the rise-time (mea-
sured between 10% and 90% of maximum), fall-time and pulse width must
be shorter than 5 ns, 15 ns and 12 ns, respectively.

rate) for diﬀerent out-of-time pulses. The time window is deﬁned with respect to
t0. The presence of a pulse in the main pulse window (t0±10 ns) is also shown.

• Dark noise

The dark noise rate, also known as dark count (DC), does not have a
big impact on ANTARES compared to other experiments, because of the
important optical background due to natural radioactivity of potassium and
bioluminescence. Previous measurements [5] show that the continuous rate
of single photoelectron events is about 60 kHz on a 10” photomultiplier ¶ .
The DC is measured at a 0.25 photoelectron threshold level after the
PMT has been kept in the dark for two hours. In these conditions, the DC
should be less than 10 kHz.

• Out-of-time pulses

Prepulses and afterpulses have several origins which can be disentangled
if the time interval that separates them from the main pulse is long enough.
Since they are time correlated with the true pulses, prepulses as well as af-
terpulses can prevent a correct reconstruction or mimic real physical events.
We call t0 the mean arrival time of the expected PMT signal associated
with the light pulse. The deﬁnitions and limits for the diﬀerent out-of-time
pulses we have considered are given in table 1.

• Photocathode requirements

Due to the low density of photomultipliers in the ANTARES telescope
(about 10−4 PMT/m3), the photon yield produced by cosmic events on the
OMs is very small. Therefore, the photocathode must be as large as possible
to minimise the cost of mechanics, within the constraints on the dimensions
discussed previously. The geometrical surface of the photocathode should
be larger than 500 cm2. On the other hand, the quantum eﬃciency should
be at least 20% and the collection eﬃciency at least 80% over the whole
photocathode surface.

¶ PMTs also occasionally detect bioluminescence bursts which produce sudden and
short rate excursions at several MHz.

• Mechanical and environmental strength

The rather peculiar environment of the photomultipliers has to be taken
into account in deﬁning their speciﬁcations. The photomultipliers should
be able to bear vibrations of up to 1 g and 1 to 55 Hz, produced during
transport and deployment (boat, deck, etc.). They should also withstand
temperature variations from -10◦C to +60◦C. Once in place, the tubes will
stay in a rather quiet surrounding at a constant temperature (∼13◦-14◦C).

There are other features which are not considered speciﬁcations but are of
interest to characterize the tubes. The energy resolution is a useful parameter
to estimate the ﬂuctuations in charge of the SPE events. A value below 40% is
considered good enough for this kind of photomultipliers. The eﬀective area,
Aef f , is deﬁned as the product of the surface of the photocathode by the
collection eﬃciency. It should be as large as possible. Finally, the eﬀect of
ageing has also to be measured. The telescope is designed for a lifetime of
about 10 years and the total charge delivered to the anode is expected to be
0.1-0.2 C/day for each PMT. Although recovery and repair of the elements of
the detector is possible, this is a costly operation. Therefore, the PMTs should
have a good stability and a long lifetime.

4 Comparison of PMT candidates

A large variety of PMT models have been tested and characterized taking
into account the constraints listed in the previous section. Tubes considered
by ANTARES either already existed on the market or have been developed
recently and speciﬁcally for neutrino telescopes. In this case, their tests were
carried out by ANTARES in close collaboration with the manufacturers.

Among the available models, we chose those closest to the speciﬁcations: the
10” Hamamatsu R7081-20, the 10.6” Photonis XP1804/D2 and the 13” Hama-
matsu R8055. Table 2 lists the characteristics of these tubes. In the following,
detailed results of the measurements performed on these PMTs are presented.

4.1 Experimental setup

In this section, the experimental setup used at IFIC (Valencia) during the
selection stage is described. For a description of the setup at CEA/DAPNIA
(Saclay) see section 5, where the results obtained on the whole sample of
R7081-20 are presented.

List of the PMT candidates studied by ANTARES.

As it can be seen in ﬁgure 3, the photomultiplier is set in a black box (80 cm ×
80 cm × 140 cm) in order to protect it from the environmental light. A µ-metal
cage shields it against the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The HV is supplied by a NIM
module located in the crate outside the box. The photomultiplier is illuminated
by means of a green laser located in another black box and triggered by a
pulse generator. An optical ﬁbre guides the light from the laser into the PMT
black box. In order to get uniform illumination of the whole photocathode an
Oriel 48020 diﬀuser [8] is used at the end of the optical ﬁbre at a distance
of about 80 cm from the PMT head. Depending on the measurement being
performed, the output signal from the photomultiplier is sent either to NIM
and CAMAC modules or to a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS640A [9]).
Both the CAMAC modules and oscilloscope are read out through a GPIB link
by a LabView program running on a PC.

The green laser used as light source to illuminate the photomultiplier is a Nd-
YAG device k , i.e. a synthetic (Y3Al5O12) crystal doped by Nd in concentra-
tions of 1020 atoms/cm3. It is pulsed by the Q-switching mechanism, providing
very fast pulses (σ ≤0.5 ns). The emitted energy per pulse is ∼1.2 µJ. The
output stability is better than 1% over several hours and the energy emission
changes less than 1% after switching on and oﬀ. The emission wavelength is
532 nm. An internal photodiode located in its head provides a trigger signal
with an error smaller than 50 ps.

4.2 PMT comparison

The following quantities were measured for each of the 3 PMT candidates:
gain, amplitude, peak to valley ratio, energy resolution, transit time spread,
dark noise rate and out-of-time pulse rate. Much of this information (gain,
peak/valley, energy resolution) is obtained from the SPE charge spectrum.
This distribution can be described by

where Gp and Gn are the Gaussian distributions corresponding to the pedestal
and to n photoelectrons respectively and F is the valley function. The valley
is approximated by the sum of an exponential and a Gaussian. Three param-
eters are needed to describe this phenomenon: the fraction of badly ampliﬁed
photoelectrons ω, the fraction of valley events contributing to the exponential
(and not to the Gaussian) β and the “slope” of the exponential α. P is the
Poisson probability of producing n photoelectrons at the ﬁrst dynode if the
product of the number of photoelectrons emitted at each laser shot, the quan-
tum eﬃciency and the collection eﬃciency is µ. If µ1 and σ1 are the parameters
of the Gaussian for a single photoelectron reaching the ﬁrst dynode, the cor-
responding parameters for two or more (n) photoelectrons are µn = n · µ1 and
n = n · σ2

Therefore, there are 8 free parameters (µ, µp, σp, µ1, σ1, ω, α, β) that can be ob-
tained ﬁtting the measured charge spectrum to equation 1. A typical example
of a charge spectrum is shown in ﬁgure 4.

Fig. 5. Gain dependence on HV for the three candidate photomultipliers.

4.2.1 Gain

The gain is obtained from the position of the SPE peak in the charge spectrum.
Figure 5 shows the gain dependence on HV for the three candidates. From
these plots, the nominal voltage can be determined: 1340 V for the R7081-20,
1680 V for the XP1804/D2 and 1900 V for the R8055.

The highest gains are reached by the Hamamatsu R7081-20 model, as expected
since this tube has 14 dynodes. It was designed to attain gains in excess of 109,
required by some experiments to transfer the analogical PMT signal along km-
long electric cables (AMANDA [13]). In the case of the Photonis XP1804/D2,
which has only 11 dynodes, the nominal voltage is naturally higher and the

increase in gain with HV smaller than for the R7081-20 model. Finally, the
Hamamatsu R8055 needs an even higher voltage to reach the nominal gain.
This is not surprising since the HV division for this tube was optimized for
TTS and not for gain. As we will see later, all 3 PMTs are able to reach a
gain of 108 without signiﬁcant deterioration of their properties.

4.2.2 Amplitude

The experimental setup used to obtain the SPE amplitude distribution is
similar to that used for the charge spectrum measurement. In this case, the
acquisition is performed by a digital oscilloscope.

The ﬁtting procedure is simpler than in the previous case. The SPE peak is
ﬁtted to a Gaussian, whose mean is the amplitude. Figure 6 shows that the
dependence of the amplitude on HV is very similar to that of the charge. This
is to be expected since for a given PMT, amplitude and charge are nearly
proportional and related to the pulse shape which in turn is linked to the
dynode structure of the photomultiplier. It is important to note that in the
ANTARES experiment, the signal amplitude will be used in the trigger (see [4]
for a more detailed description).

The typical SPE amplitudes between anode and ground on 50 Ω at the nominal
voltage are 46, 60 and 34 mV respectively for the R7081-20, the XP1804/D2
and the R8055.

4.2.3 Peak to valley ratio

The ratio between the height of the SPE peak and the valley, measured from
the SPE charge spectrum, is important since it can be used to estimate the
capability of the photomultiplier to discriminate the number of photoelectrons
in an event. As it was seen in section 3, the ANTARES speciﬁcations require
a P/V larger than 2. Figure 7 shows the results of the measurements for this
quantity.

The peak to valley ratio of the Hamamatsu R7081-20 model at the nominal
voltage is around 2.8. For higher HV, it is almost ﬂat in the region of interest.
Concerning the Photonis photomultipliers, it can be seen that the P/V ratio
is around 2.7. It grows with HV at low voltages and then levels oﬀ. The
peak/valley ratio of all the Hamamatsu R8055 tubes is very good (P/V=3.7)
and stable near the nominal voltage. For very low or very high voltages, the
peak/valley ratio decreases.

4.2.4 Energy resolution

Energy resolution is calculated as the ratio of σ1 to µ1. The results are shown
in ﬁgure 8.

The 10” Hamamatsu model exhibits an almost ﬂat dependence on HV. The
behaviour of the XP1804/D2 is also smooth. There is a slow increase of the
energy resolution with HV, which becomes stable near the nominal voltage. At
this point, energy resolution is in general over 30%. In the curve corresponding
to the R8055, two regions can be observed: the energy resolution undergoes a
relatively fast increase at low voltages and then stabilises. Table 3 shows the

4.2.5 Transit time spread

As already pointed out, the transit time spread is a key parameter and has
to be measured with high accuracy. The setup for this measurement is as
follows. The laser illuminates the photomultiplier, whose output is discrimi-
nated in order to provide the STOP signal to the TDC. The START signal
is given by the internal photodiode of the laser. The results presented in this
section were obtained setting the discrimination threshold at 0.5 pe. The total
FWHM consists of three components: Γ2 = Γ2
e, where ΓP is the in-
trinsic TTS of the photomultiplier that we aim to measure, ΓL is the FWHM
of the laser pulse and Γe is the time jitter contribution from the electron-
ics. In order to subtract the two last terms, a very fast photomultiplier was
used. Hamamatsu indicates for this photomultiplier (model R5496) a value of
FWHM = 0.23 ± 0.01 ns. Illuminating the fast photomultiplier using the same
experimental setup it is possible to measure the total width of the distribution
Γ and calculate the eﬀect of the source and the electronics. Our measurement
shows that they contribute as much as 0.65 ± 0.05 ns to the total FWHM.

P + Γ2

L + Γ2

The dependence of the TTS on HV is shown in ﬁgure 9. As expected, the TTS
decreases for higher voltages. This behaviour is nearly the same for all three
candidates, with a decrease of about 1 ns for a 300-400 V change around the
nominal voltage.

As in the case of the charge spectrum, the errors given by the ﬁt are much
smaller than those due to ﬂuctuations in the experimental conditions, so that
an estimate of the latter is obtained by repeating the measurements. The best

values of TTS are obtained for the Photonis PMT. However, all the models
provide results within the chosen speciﬁcations.

4.2.6 Dark noise

To measure the dark current, the output from the photomultiplier is sent to
a Linear Fan In / Fan Out module that sends identical signals to amplitude
discriminators. The number of pulses above each threshold is counted. Each
discriminator uses a diﬀerent threshold. For the sake of comparison among the
tubes, this threshold is expressed in number of photoelectrons in amplitude.

The dependence of the dark noise on HV has been measured using this setup.
The results are plotted in ﬁgure 10, where the dark noise rate for a threshold
of half a photoelectron is shown.

Whereas the dark noise dependence on the HV for the 10” Hamamatsu PMT
is almost ﬂat, it increases smoothly for the other two tubes. This increase is
faster at low voltages for the 10.6” Photonis PMTs, while the opposite occurs
for the 13” Hamamatsu tubes, where the increase is faster at high voltages.

4.2.7 Out-of-time pulses

As it has been mentioned, it is important to control out-of-time pulses since
it may cause misreconstruction problems. Several kinds of events have been
analyzed.

The experimental setup used to measure the out-of-time pulse rate is similar
to that used to measure the SPE spectrum. The photomultiplier is illumi-

nated by a low level of light (∼0.1 pe per pulse) and its output is sent to the
oscilloscope, which is triggered by the laser internal photodiode. The oscillo-
scope digitizes the output from the PMT and sends it to the PC, where a
LabView program ﬁnds the peaks in the waveform. The time scale used in the
analysis of prepulses, delayed pulses and afterpulses-1 is 0.2 ns per channel
which allows to cover ±200 ns around the main pulse. On the other hand, the
scale to measure afterpulses-2 is 10 ns per channel, i.e. it covers the region
from −4 to 16 µs with respect to the main pulse window. In this case, the
signal from the photomultiplier is too narrow to be detected by the oscillo-
scope. A discriminator is used, which implies, however, a loss of the amplitude
information.

The R7081-20 is within the speciﬁcations. The XP1804/D2 shows a high rate
of afterpulses-1 and -2. Some of the rates for the R8055 are also high (see
table 3).

4.2.8 Photocathode eﬀective area

As mentioned in section 3, the eﬀective area is the surface of the photocathode
multiplied by the collection eﬃciency, which is often dependent on the hit
position. This dependence is estimated by scanning the PMT with a collimated
LED, assuming the collection eﬃciency to be near unity at the very centre of
the photocathode.

As expected, the best value of the eﬀective area corresponds to the larger PMT,
i.e. the Hamamatsu R8055. The smallest eﬀective area is that of the Photonis
XP1804/D2, although being a bit larger in diameter than the Hamamatsu

R7081-20.

4.3 Conclusions on comparison

Tables 3 and 4 summarize the value of the measured parameters. All the candi-
dates present good performance in general. All PMTs have good values for gain
(the nominal voltage is lower than 2000 V and the gain reaches 108). The peak
to valley ratio for all the models is well in agreement with our requirements for
all the models, being always above 2. The values of the energy resolution are
similar, and all within the speciﬁcations. Concerning the transit time spread,
the XP1804/D2 shows the lower value of TTS, the values for R7081-20 and
R8055 being also acceptable. The best value of dark noise is achieved by the
R7081-20 (better than expected given its smaller photocathode). The other
two models are also within the speciﬁcations. Both XP1804/D2 and R8055
present high afterpulse rates and the latter has also a high prepulse rate. The
PMT with a best ratio of the photocathode eﬀective area to the photocathode
surface is the Hamamatsu R7081-20. Finally, the Hamamatsu R7081-20 model
was chosen for the ANTARES detector.

the ANTARES test bench at CEA/DAPNIA, Saclay.

Given the high number of PMTs involved, the experimental test setup has to
allow all measurements to be performed at a fast rate. The test bench consists
of a light tight plastic cylinder 1.5 m long and 0.46 m in diameter. The cylinder
was painted in black on the inside to avoid reﬂections and covered by a µ-metal
foil externally. Light from a pulsed blue LED is fed through an optical ﬁbre
into one extremity of the tube. A Lambertian diﬀuser (Oriel 48010 [8]) located
just after the LED and about 1.1 m away from the PMT is used to ensure
uniform illumination of the whole photocathode. The PMT itself is shielded
by a µ-metal cage that reduces the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld by a factor 3 to 4.
Instead of the PMT base provided by Hamamatsu, a new base (a modiﬁed
version of the PHQ5912 base developed by ISEG [14]) was used. The HV and
the distribution for the dynodes is generated by the base itself. This change
also allowed some improvement in the PMT response, in particular in the
TTS. Due to this new design, the results given in this section for the R7081-
20 model slightly diﬀer from those given in section 4. A summary of the results
of the parameters studied for this sample of PMTs is shown in Table 5.

Finally, in order to study the ageing of the selected model, three tubes were
placed in a black box and excited by three independent blue LEDs located a
few centimeters above the top of the PMTs. LEDs were tuned to reproduce the
optical background environment (40K and bioluminescence) expected in the
ANTARES site [5]. In a ﬁrst run, the LEDs were programmed to emit a con-
tinuous rate of 100 kHz and bursts of 1 MHz lasting 0.1 second every second.
The total integrated charge in the PMTs amounts to more than 100 C, which
corresponds to two years in the sea at a constant gain of 108. Subsequently,
the LED pulse rate was increased by a factor of 5, thus allowing a total charge
of 500 C, corresponding to 10 years in the sea, to be collected by the PMTs.
The most signiﬁcant variation of the PMT properties concerns the gain. Over
the ﬁrst 100 days, all three PMTs showed an increase of 50-70% in gain, before
they level oﬀ. This phenomenon corresponds to the runnning-in phase, rather
than ageing. All other important energy and timing properties of the PMTs
(P/V, energy resolution and TTS) were stable over the test period. The dark
current remained also stable with time. However, afterpulse-2 rate showed an
increase (around 30%) during the test, possibly caused by the fact that these
pulses are usually due to gas of ionized atoms, whose number increases with

6 Conclusion

The ANTARES collaboration has carried out a study of large cathode photo-
multipliers for a submarine neutrino telescope. Several candidates have been
considered. In particular, intensive tests on the R7081-20 and R8055 models
from Hamamatsu and the XP1804/D2 from Photonis have been performed.
The measurements to compare them show that they have in general appropri-
ate performance. Finally, the R7081-20 model was chosen for the contruction
of the ANTARES neutrino telescope and the full quantity of 912 PMTs sup-
plied were tested. The measurements on this batch show that the mean values
are within the speciﬁcations (only the average afterpulse-1 rate is slightly over
the limit). The tubes which are not within the speciﬁcations are few and close
to the limits. Nevertheless they were replaced.

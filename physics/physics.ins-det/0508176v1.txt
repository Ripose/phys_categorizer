Abstract. The Q & A experiment, aiming at the detection of vacuum
birefringence predicted by quantum electrodynamics, consists mainly of a
suspended 3.5 m Fabry-Perot cavity, a rotating permanent dipole magnet and
an ellipsometer. The 2.3 T magnet can rotate up to 10 rev/s, introducing an
ellipticity signal at twice the rotation frequency. The X-pendulum gives a good
isolation ratio for seismic noise above its main resonant frequency 0.3 Hz. At
present, the ellipsometry noise decreases with frequency, from 1×10−5 rad·Hz−1/2
at 5 Hz, 2×10−6 rad·Hz−1/2 at 20 Hz to 5×10−7 rad·Hz−1/2 at 40 Hz. The shape
of the noise spectrum indicates possible improvement when the movement between
the cavity mirrors is further controlled and reduced. From the preliminary result
of yaw motion alignment control, it can be seen that some peaks due to yaw motion
of the cavity mirror was suppressed. In this paper, we ﬁrst give a schematic view of
the Q & A experiment, and then present the measurement of transfer function of
the compound X-pendulum-double pendulum suspension. A closed-loop control
was carried out to verify the validity of the measured transfer function. The
ellipsometry noise spectra with and without yaw alignment control and the newest
improvement is presented.

1. Introduction

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) predicts that vacuum is birefringent under the
inﬂuence of a strong magnetic ﬁeld [1-6]. For a B ﬁeld of 2.5 T, the diﬀerence
of index of refraction experienced by the light with polarization parallel and with
polarization perpendicular to the B ﬁeld is ∆n ≡ nk − n⊥ = 2.5 × 10−23. This
tiny eﬀect can be detected by a precision determination of the induced ellipticity on
a laser beam [5]. The development of ultrahigh-precision technology in the laser-
interferometric gravitational-wave detection community prompted our thought of its
application to this matter [6]. First experiment was done in 1993 by Cameron et al [7]
with good upper bounds on vacuum birefringence and polarization rotation. A pseudo-
scalar interaction with electromagnetism (LI ∼ Fij Fkleijkl) was proposed which was
empirically allowed in the study of equivalence principles [8-10]; in terms of Feynman
diagram, this interaction gives a 2-photon-pseudo-scalar vertex. With this interaction,
vacuum becomes birefringent and dichroic [11-13]. In 1994, 3 experiments were put
forward and started for measuring the vacuum birefringence: the PVLAS experiment

[14], the Fermilab P-877 experiment [15], and the Q & A (QED & Axion) experiment
[16]; these experiment were reported in the ”Frontier Test of QED and Physics of
Vacuum” Meeting in 1998. Fermilab P-877 experiment was terminated in 2000. This
year in the QED-2005 (QED, Quantum Vacuum and the Search for New Forces, Les
Houches, France, June, 2005) conference, again, 3 experiments were reported: the
PVLAS experiment [17], the BMV experiment [18], and the Q & A experiment [19].
A compilation of basic characteristics of these 3 experiments were given in [20]. All
3 experiments use a high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) cavity to enhance
the eﬀect to be measured. The PVLAS experiment reported a positive measurement
of polarization rotation and suggested a possible interpretation of this result to the
existence of a pseudoscalar particle coupled to photons [17, 21].

In 2002, We had constructed and tested our prototype 3.5 m high-ﬁnesse Fabry-
Perot interferometer(FPI) with ellipsometry [22]. Since then, we have been making
eﬀorts to improve the stability of feedback control and the sensitivity of ellipticity
detection. Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. The laser beam is phase modulated
at 12 MHz for Pound-Drever-Hall locking technique. Before entering the FPI, the
laser is linearly polarized by a polarizing prism of Glan-Taylor type with an extinction
ratio around 90 dB. Each mirror of the FPI is suspended by an X-pendulum [23]
with a double pendulum as the second stage, as shown in ﬁgure 2. X-pendulum
was designed and developed by the TAMA group, a two-dimensional horizontal low
frequency vibration isolator. We followed their design closely and obtained a resonant
frequency of 0.3 Hz. The double pendulum consists of an intermediate mass IM, a
recoil mass RM and the mirror CM1. The longitudinal length of the FPI can be
adjusted by applying force to magnets on the CM1 through coils held by the RM.
A 0.6 m long rotating permanent dipole magnet with a maximum central ﬁeld of 2.3
T is located between CM1 and CM2 for producing a polarized vacuum that is to be
probed by the laser beam resonating inside the FPI. After the laser leaving out of
FPI, the induced ellipticity on it is transformed into polarization rotation by a λ/4
wave-plate for frequency mixing with the modulation provided by the Faraday cell FC

[7]. Finally, the laser is extinguished by another polarizing prism whose transmission
axis is aligned orthogonally to the polarizer’s transmission axis. The transmitted light
and reﬂected light are received by PD2 and PD3 respectively. The output of PD3
is used for switching on/oﬀ the feedback force on CM1. PD1, QPD1 and QPD2 are
the essential sensors for maintaining the FPI at its working point. In the following,
we present the transfer function measurement, feedback control and the preliminary
results. Outlook and discussion is given in the end.

2. Transfer function measurement

For active control of the cavity mirror, we have measured the transfer function (TF)
from the coil-magnet pair actuators to the displacement and rotation of the cavity
mirror. An HP 3-axis heterodyne interferometer capable of sensing two rotational
and one longitudinal motions of the cavity mirror was used as the sensor. The cavity
mirror and the IM were arranged in a double pendulum conﬁguration and suspended
from the load table of the X-pendulum. Coils were held by a rigid frame extended
from the load table of the X-pendulum. Because the mass of the load table is much
larger than that of the cavity mirror, the transfer function was reduced to a double
pendulum’s TF. One of the measured transfer functions is shown in ﬁgure 3. A closed-
loop control was performed to verify the measured TFs. The loop ﬁlter was designed
and optimized by the closed-loop simulation with the model TF, and realized by a
digital control unit.
In ﬁgure 4, the rms amplitude was suppressed from 4.05 µm
to 0.23 µm for the longitudinal motion and from 15.5 µrad to 4.4 µrad for the yaw
motion. In this test, we found that when the load table of the X-pendulum was excited
by the environment, the control became unstable. It was possibly due to the presence
of the X-pendulum’s resonance which leads to an extra pole appearing in the TFs.
To overcome it, the double pendulum has been modiﬁed as it is in ﬁgure 2. Coils are
held by a weight-matched (to CM1) recoil mass, the TF for the longitudinal motion
is reduced to that of a simple pendulum. This allows a wider bandwidth and a better
stability in control. The TF for yaw is still characterized by a model TF as in ﬁgure
3, for the moment-of-inertia is not matched in this design.

3. Feedback control

3.1. Longitudinal control

Because of the large resonant displacement of the X-pendulum, the frequency range
of the laser is not suﬃcient to track the cavity resonant frequency. Thus, the error
signal for longitudinal control has to be fed back into two paths: one for frequency
of the laser with a dynamic range of ± 120 MHz and a bandwidth over 100 kHz;
another one for cavity length control with a dynamic range of ±3 mm(∼ ±240 GHz)
and a bandwidth of about 200 Hz. In the ﬁrst path, a typical loop ﬁlter consisting
of an integrator and a lag compensator was used; in the second path, the loop ﬁlter
was a ﬁrst-order low pass ﬁlter whose cut-oﬀ frequency is 100 Hz in series with a lag
compensator. The ratio of DC gains of these two paths determines the stability of the
closed-loop control. The unit gain frequency of the longitudinal open-loop TF is 13.3
kHz.

3.2. Alignment control

The diﬀerential wavefront sensing technique [24] is adopted here. We use a quadrant
photodiode (QPD) with a resonant circuit [25] as our wavefront sensor. An active
control on centering the interference pattern on the QPD was employed for reducing
spurious alignment signal. The bandwidth for the yaw alignment control was about
15 Hz and the loop ﬁlter basically consisted of an integrator and a bi-quadratic ﬁlter
(a complex zero and a complex pole). The transient response while closing the yaw
alignment control loop is plotted in ﬁgure 5. The longitudinal loop acquired the
”lock” at time = 0 s from an ”oﬀ-lock” event. Some yaw motion excited by the
event remained and can not be suppressed by the longitudinal loop. At time = 34
s, the yaw alignment control was turned on and began to rotate the mirror to its
proper orientation and to stop the mirror’s yaw motion. The consequence is that the
transmitted light power increased and its ﬂuctuation decreased. The eﬀect of the yaw
alignment control can also be seen in the ellipticity noise spectrum in ﬁgure 6. Now,
only one out of four degrees of freedom of cavity mirrors is actively controlled. The
three remaining d.o.f.’s will be controlled soon after this conference.

4. Preliminary results

The sensitivity curve of ellipticity detection by now is plotted in ﬁgure 6. The
signal current I received by PD2 in ﬁgure 1 can be described by the Malus law
I = I0[σ2 + (α + η0 cos ωf t)2] where I0 is the signal when the analyzer is rotated
for maximum transmission of analyzed light, σ2 is the extinction ratio of the analyzer,
α is the ellipticity signal coming from various noise sources and η0 cos ωf t is the
modulation of polarization rotation with a modulation depth of η0 at frequency ωf .
After demodulation, α was obtained. In the spectrum of α, the noise density decreases
with frequency, from 1 × 10−5 rad·Hz−1/2 at 5 Hz, 2 × 10−6 rad·Hz−1/2 at 20 Hz to
5 × 10−7 rad·Hz−1/2 at 40 Hz. From the shape of the spectrum, we can infer that
part of the noise comes from the noisy motion of the cavity mirror. This is more
evident when the yaw alignment control was turned on. The dashed line in ﬁgure 6 is
lower than the solid one for frequency below 15 Hz. But above 15 Hz, extra noise was
introduced by the alignment control. We are still working on this, to ﬁnd out where
the noise is from and to eliminate it.

the control is on, the ﬂuctuation in the transmitted light power diminishes.

5. Outlook and discussion

In the near future, things to be done include: (i)Add alignment control in the rest 3
d.o.f.’s and reﬁne the control; (ii)Increase the ﬁnesse of the FPI; (iii)Add a polarization
maintaining ﬁber as a simple mode cleaner [26]. Hopefully we can achieved our goal
sensitivity of 5×10−8 rad ·Hz−1/2 at 10∼20 Hz. For the next phase (third phase) after
this, with 5-fold improvement on optical sensitivity, 5 m rotating permanent magnet,
and interferometer length extended to 7 m, vacuum birefringence would be in our
reach. In this second phase, we will be able to perform an independent measurement
of polarization rotation to compare with the PVLAS result [17, 21].

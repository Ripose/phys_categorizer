Abstract

A large volume Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is being considered for the central
charged particle tracker for the detector for the proposed International Linear Col-
100 µm with
lider (ILC). To meet the ILC-TPC spatial resolution challenge of
a manageable number of readout pads and channels of electronics, Micro Pattern
Gas Detectors (MPGD) are being developed which could use pads comparable in
width to the proportional-wire/cathode-pad TPC. We have built a prototype GEM
readout TPC with 2 mm x 6 mm pads using the new concept of charge dispersion
in MPGDs with a resistive anode. The dependence of transverse resolution on the
drift distance has been measured for small angle tracks in cosmic ray tests without
a magnetic ﬁeld for Ar:CO2(90:10). The GEM-TPC resolution with charge disper-
sion readout is signiﬁcantly better than previous measurements carried out with
conventional direct charge readout techniques.

1 Introduction

Large volume time projection chambers (TPC) [1, 2] have been used as high
precision tracking detectors in many high energy physics experiments since
the 1970s. A large volume TPC is also a prime track detector candidate for

future experiments at the International Linear collider (ILC). However for
the ILC application, it will be important to improve the spatial resolution
capability for the TPC. A promising possibility is the replacement of the
traditional proportional-wire/cathode-pad readout by a Micro Pattern Gas
Detector (MPGD) like the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [3, 4]. This would
eliminate one of the major systematic errors which results from the so called
E × B eﬀect [5] that degrades the TPC spatial resolution.

The readout of a TPC with MPGD has several advantages but also some
drawbacks, both of which are related to the conﬁnement of the signal charge
to a small spatial region due to reduced transverse in a high magnetic ﬁeld. The
advantage is that the localization has the potential to improve the double track
resolution. The disadvantage with conventional MPGD direct charge readout
technique is that it leads to diﬃculties with the determination of the signal
2 mm, signals may often be conﬁned to
position. For a nominal pad size of
one or two pads only making a centroid calculation less precise, in contrast to
the proportional-wire/cathode-pad readout. A smaller pad width would lead
to a better resolution but also to a large number of readout channels which
may be diﬃcult to manage for a large detector.

∼

One possibility to improve the signal centroid determination and thus achieve
good resolution with relatively wide pads is to use a MPGD with a resistive
anode which disperses the avalanche charge and allows the signal to be recon-
structed on several pads. The principle of charge dispersion has been proven
previously [6] for a GEM using point X-ray source. The charge dispersion phe-
nomenon and its application to MPGD-TPC readout are now well understood
as shown in the excellent agreement of model simulations with experimental
data [7]. In this paper, we present our ﬁrst results of MPGD-TPC track resolu-
tion measurements with charge dispersion for cosmic-ray particles. The spatial
resolution of a GEM-TPC is measured as a function of drift distance using the
charge dispersion technique. Ar:CO2(90:10) was used as a ﬁll gas to mimic the
reduced transverse diﬀusion for a TPC in a high magnetic ﬁeld. The results
are compared to our previous measurements of GEM-TPC resolution [8] with
direct charge readout for the same gas.

2 Experimental setup

A small 15 cm drift length double-GEM TPC used earlier for cosmic ray
resolution studies with conventional direct charge readout [8] was modiﬁed for
the measurements reported here. The standard anode pad readout plane was
replaced with a resistive anode readout structure [6]. The new anode structure
is fabricated by laminating a 25 µm thick ﬁlm of carbon loaded Kapton with
an eﬀective surface resistivity of 530 KΩ/(cid:3) to the readout pad PCB using a

2

double sided insulating adhesive. The adhesive provides a 50 µm gap between
the resistive anode and the PCB. Taking the dielectric constant of the glue
0.22 pF/mm2.
into account, the gap results in a capacitance density of C
The ﬁlm surface resistivity and the capacitance results in a RC coupling of
the anode to the readout plane. An avalanche charge arriving at the anode
surface disperses with the system RC time constant. Signals are induced on
readout pads as explained in reference [6].

≃

The TPC drift ﬁeld for Ar:CO2(90:10) at 300 V/cm was larger than in our
previous measurements with direct charge readout for the same gas. From
Magboltz [9], we ﬁnd that the larger drift ﬁeld increased the electron drift ve-
locity from 8.9 to 22.75 µm/ns, and decreased the transverse diﬀusion slightly
from 0.229 to 0.223 µm/√cm. Within measurement errors, the eﬀective gas
gain for the two measurements was about the same, about 6700.

×

The layout of the readout pad system contained 5 inner rows of 12 pads each
(pad size: 2 mm
6 mm), together with two large area outer pads whose
signals are used for selecting cosmic events for analysis. Charge signals on the
central 60 pads used for tracking were read out using Aleph proportional wire
TPC readout preampliﬁers. We used 200 MHz 8 bit FADCs, designed previ-
ously for another application, to digitize preampliﬁer signals directly without
an intermediate shaper ampliﬁer. Since charge dispersion pulses are slow and
signals were integrated over a few hundred ns during analysis, 25 to 40 MHz
FADCs would have been adequate.

The data analysis method is similar to that used in our previous publica-
tion [8] on GEM-TPC with conventional direct charge readout except for the
amplitude reconstruction technique. For the direct charge measurement, sig-
nals result only from the charge deposit on a pad. Depending on the transverse
diﬀusion in the TPC gas, one or more pads in a row have a signal. In this type
of normal TPC readout, all signals have the same shape, e.g. rise-time, and
the maximum amplitude is proportional to the charge collected by the pad.
The pad response function (PRF) can be evaluated from the known diﬀusion
properties of the gas and readout geometry.

For the charge dispersion readout, in contrast, pads away from the region of
direct charge collection on the anode may still see measurable signals due to
the RC dispersion of the cluster charge on the resistive surface. The observed
amplitude and the charge pulse shape depends on the distance of the pad with
respect to the track ionization clusters and the characteristics of the front-end
electronics. Pads seeing a part of the direct charge on the anode will have a
prompt signal with a fast rise-time, while other pads with signals resulting
only from charge dispersion will have a smaller slower rise-time delayed signal
depending on the distance to the track. In principle, a determination of the
track PRF is possible starting from the charge dispersion model. However,

shaded areas indicate the regions used to compute signal amplitudes to determine

small RC inhomogeneities of the resistive anode readout structure introduce
systematic eﬀects which make the theoretical PRF deviate from the measure-
ment, as observed in Reference [7]. For the present analysis, the PRF as well as
the systematic eﬀects are determined empirically from the internal consistency
of a subset of cosmic ray track data used only for calibration. The remaining
part of the data is used for resolution studies.

As both the rise time and the pulse height carry track position information, the
PRF will depend on the method used to reconstruct the pad signal amplitude
from the measured pulse. The following method uses both the time and pulse
height information to obtain a narrower PRF with shorter tails. For a given pad
row, the largest pulse is identiﬁed and its amplitude calculated by maximizing
the average pulse height in a 150 ns window. The large fast rise time pulse
arises mainly from the primary charge. For a single track, adjacent pads in
the row have delayed slower rising smaller signals; which reach their maximum
peak pulse heights later. For these pads, the start of the integration time
window is kept at the value obtained from the largest pad signal and the
width is increased to maximize the reconstructed amplitude. The maximum
window width is limited to 500 ns.

Fast pulses, from the primary charge, are thus averaged only over a short time

4

period, leading to a larger calculated amplitude. Slower rising smaller pulses
are averaged over a longer time window, improving the signal to noise ratio.
Since the start of the time window is determined by the main pulse in the row,
late pulses will be reconstructed with a smaller computed amplitude as well
leading to a suppression of the tails of the pad response function. Figure 1
shows the observed pulses for a cosmic ray track for the ﬁve tracking rows
of pads. The time bins used for the determination of the amplitudes are also
indicated. Diﬀerences in the shapes between the main pulse dominated by
primary charge and pulses from charge dispersion on pads farther away are
visible.

Figure 2a shows the PRF data for drift distances up to 1 cm. The relative
amplitude is shown as a function of the distance between the pad-center and

∆ = 11.9 mm were held constant.

Since the track ﬁt uses a χ2 minimization, the amplitude measurement errors
must also be determined from the data. In our case, this error is dominated
by systematic eﬀects leading to a mainly linear dependence on the amplitude.

to small local variations in the RC from imperfections in the quality of ma-
terials and technique used presently in laminating the resistive anode readout
assembly. The bias is intrinsic to the detector and does not change with time.
It can therefore be easily corrected. The calibration data set used for the PRF
determination is also used to determine the bias correction for each pad row
in 500 µm steps. Figure 3b shows the mean track residuals for the central pad
row after bias correction. The remaining bias after correction was small.

where s0 is the resolution at z = 0, CD is the transverse diﬀusion constant
and Neﬀ is the eﬀective number of electrons along the track in a row.

Electronic noise and systematic eﬀects contribute to the constant term s0, the
resolution at zero drift distance. The constant term s0 is about 80 µm for the
charge dispersion readout. In contrast, as shown in Figure 5, the TPC resolu-
tion with the conventional GEM readout for drift distances approaching zero
would be much larger (138 µm at 5 mm), due to lack of precision in pad cen-
troid determination from diﬀusion. The resolution for the conventional GEM
readout improves with increasing transverse diﬀusion for larger drift distances.
Nevertheless, the TPC resolution obtained with the charge dispersion readout
remains better than with the conventional GEM readout [8] even for larger
drift distances. This is due to the fact that the charge dispersion phenom-
ena can be completely described by material properties and geometry and the
centroid of the dispersed charge signals on the resistive anode can be accu-
rately determined, in contrast to centroid determination from diﬀusion, which
is statistical in nature.

4 Summary and outlook

A GEM-TPC with a charge dispersion readout system incorporating a resis-
tive anode has been used to measure particle track resolutions for the ﬁrst
time. The resistive anode allows a controlled dispersion of the track charge
clusters over several pads which can be used for a precise determination of the
charge centroid. Using 2 mm x 6 mm pads, we have shown that charge dis-
persion improves the GEM-TPC resolution signiﬁcantly over that achievable
with conventional direct charge readout, both at short and at long drift dis-
tances. Imperfections in the resistive anode assembly and materials lead to a
position measurement bias which can be easily corrected. The bias remaining
after correction is small. With improvements in fabrication techniques and the
quality of materials, the measurement bias will be reduced further. The TPC
pad readout signals were digitized at 200 MHz for the results reported here.
We are in the process of developing slower 25 to 40 MHz digitizers which will
be adequate for these type of measurements.

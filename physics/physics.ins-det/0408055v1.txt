Abstract

Hamamatsu R5900-00-M64 and R7600-00-M64 photomultiplier tubes will be used
with wavelength–shifting optical ﬁbres to read out scintillator strips in the MINOS
near detector. We report on measurements of the gain, eﬃciency, linearity, crosstalk,
and dark noise of 232 of these PMTs, of which 219 met MINOS requirements.

large segmented tracking calorime-
ters to make precise measurements
of the atmospheric neutrino oscilla-
tion parameters [1,2]. MINOS uses
extruded scintillator strips to form
the calorimeter. Wavelength-shifting
(WLS) ﬁbres are glued into a longitu-
dinal groove along each strip, so that
some of the blue scintillation light
is absorbed in the ﬁbre and isotrop-
ically re-emitted as green light. A
fraction of green light is trapped in

the end of the strip, clear polystyrene
ﬁbres carry the light to multi-anode
PMTs. Planes of 1 cm thick scintil-
lator strips are sandwiched between
2.54 cm thick planes of steel to form
the detectors.

In the MINOS Far Detector, R5900-
00-M16 PMTs [3,4] are used with 8
ﬁbres optically coupled to each pixel
in order to reduce the cost of the
readout electronics. At the Near De-
tector, MINOS uses R5900-00-M64
and R7600-00-M64 PMTs 4 (collec-
tively referred to in this work as
“M64s”) with one ﬁbre per pixel to
avoid reconstruction ambiguities in
the higher-rate detector.

Several other experiments have needs
similar to MINOS and the same ba-
sic technology for reading out scin-
tillator. In particular, OPERA [6]
will use M64 PMTs in a tracker sim-
ilar to MINOS detectors. The pro-
posed MINERνA experiment [7] has
also chosen M64s as their baseline
technology. The K2K SciBar detec-
tor uses similar multi-anode PMTs
[8]. Scintillating ﬁbre detectors have
very similar requirements for PMTs,
and M64s have been proposed or
adopted by HERA-b [9], CALET
[10], GLAST [11], PET detectors
[12], and neutron detectors [13].

In this work we present the analysis
of 232 M64 PMTs (13 of which were
R7600, the rest of which were R5900)

4 The R5900-00-M64 and R7600-00-
M64 models diﬀer only slightly in that
the latter lacks an external mounting
ﬂange. Hamamatsu has replaced the
R5900 model with the R7600 [5].

from several production batches, de-
livered between May 2001 and Au-
gust 2003. The PMTs included in
this sample were those that passed
extensive testing and review; out of
232 PMTs tested, 13 PMTs were
rejected for use in MINOS by crite-
ria discussed below. The 13 rejected
PMTs were not included in the plots
and other results presented here.

The basic description of the M64
and the test equipment is described
in section 2. For use in MINOS, the
PMTs were required to have well-
resolved single-photoelectron peak
for each pixel, as described in section
3, to ensure high sensitivity. Because
of the limited dynamic range of MI-
NOS electronics, a speciﬁed unifor-
mity was required between pixels
on a single PMT. Uniformity con-
straints on both gain and eﬃciency
are deﬁned in section 4. Linearity,
described in section 5, was mea-
sured and was required to reduce
the systematic eﬀects when doing
calorimetry on high-density showers.
The multi-channel nature of the de-
vice raised concerns about crosstalk,
which is discussed in section 6. Fi-
nally, low dark noise, discussed in
section 7, is a required feature for
MINOS as it reduces load on the
data acquisition system.

2 Description of the M64 and

test equipment

The M64 PMT consists of a single
bi-alkali photocathode behind which
are focusing electrodes which guide
photoelectrons into one of 64 pixels

pacitive tap on the 12th dynode was
provided on the PCB. The charge on
this dynode signal was integrated to
provide a simple analog sum of the
64 channels. In the MINOS detec-
tor electronics, this dynode signal is
used for triggering readout.

Before testing, the M64s were mounted
into the MINOS PMT assembly
hardware similar to that described
in Ref. [4]. First, M64s were glued
into uniform Norel collars. These
collars were designed to slide tightly
into a “PMT holder”. The voltage-
divider PCB was attached to the
back of the holder, and the front of
the holder was attached a “cookie
holder”, which provided attachment
points for the optical ﬁbre mount.
Because the shape of the outer PMT
casing does not have a ﬁxed relation
to the pixel positions, the cookie
holder was aligned with respect to
the PMT such that it was centered
on alignment marks etched in the
ﬁrst dynode plate. This arrangement
allows any ﬁbre cookie to be attached
to any PMT with the ﬁbres in the
correct positions centered above the
pixels. The alignment system had a
precision better than 0.1 mm. (Pre-
vious measurements [15] have indi-
cated that this precision is adequate
to center the ﬁbres. At this precision,
the PMT response is reproducible
after disassembly and re-alignment.)

ﬁbres were 1.2 mm in diameter, and
were ﬂy-cut with a diamond bit to

arranged on an 8 by 8 grid. Each
pixel is multiplied by a two “metal
dynode channels”; each dynode plate
has two slits per pixel which act as
the multiplying surfaces. Focusing
wires are used to keep electrons in-
side the logical pixel areas. Each
pixel is read out by a single anode
pad. The active area of each pixel on
the PMT window is approximately
1.4 mm×1.4 mm. Between pixels is
a 0.3 mm space in which eﬃciency is
reduced. The R5900-00-M64 PMT is
shown in Figure 1.

The MINOS experiment operates
PMTs with the cathodes at nega-
tive high voltage and the anodes at
ground. A custom-made printed cir-
cuit board attached to the base of
the PMT provides a voltage-divider
circuit to apply voltage to the dyn-
odes in the ratio recommended by
Hamamatsu[14] for optimal perfor-
mance (3:2:2:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:5). Ca-
pacitors are used at the last stages to
stabilize the potentials in the case of
large instantaneous currents. In ad-
dition to the 64 anode signals, a ca-

mounted with alignment pins that
ensured that the clear ﬁbres were
centered on the active pixel areas of
the PMT.

Each clear ﬁbre terminated at the
center of a hole in an aluminum
plate. A stepper-motor system was
constructed to move a cylinder (the
“light pen”) into any one of these
holes. The pen held the end of a green
(∼530 nm) wavelength-shifting ﬁ-
bre. The other end of the 4 m WLS
ﬁbre 5 was illuminated from the side
by a blue LED.

5 A four-meter ﬁbre was used to ap-
proximate the attenuated light spec-
trum seen at the end of a MINOS scin-
tillator strip.

The spectrum of green light from the
WLS ﬁbre is shown in Figure 3[16].
The ﬁbre and LED were separated
by changeable neutral-density ﬁlters
which provided diﬀerent light levels
in the tests. The LED was pulsed
with a <5 ns wide pulse. The WLS
ﬂuor has a decay time of 7 ns, so the
light pulse at the PMT was .10 ns
FWHM.

In these tests, every channel of the
PMT was read out with charge-
integrating RABBIT PMA electronics[17].
The LED was pulsed by the RABBIT
system. The pulse rate was limited
by the data acquisition to about 200
pulses per second. This system used
a 16-bit ADC to sequentially read
out each channel with a quantization

of 0.71 fC per count and a typical
resolution of 13 fC RMS per chan-
nel. Charges were integrated over a
duration of 1.1 µs.

Up to three tubes were mounted
in the test stand at one time. The
fourth position was permanently oc-
cupied by an M64 PMT used for
monitoring the light level. For each
LED ﬂash, one pixel on one PMT
was illuminated, and all 64 pixels
were read out along with 3 pixels
on the monitoring tube. For each
complete scan of pixels on the PMT,
the three monitor PMT pixels were
also ﬂashed to track the light level
of the light pulser. Pedestals were
subtracted using data taken with the
PMT unilluminated.

A complete testing cycle of three
PMTs
took approximately three
days. Four hours were spent allowing
tubes to condition to high voltage in
the dark. Then scans were taken at
varying high voltages for ﬁve hours.

A nominal operating voltage was
chosen automatically, as described
in section 4. The tubes were then
scanned at each of 11 diﬀerent light
levels (set by the adjustable ﬁlter)
to test single-p.e. response, gain, lin-
earity, and crosstalk over the next 13
hours. Then illumination was turned
oﬀ and dark noise was recorded for
the remaining 55 hours, interrupted
by two scans to test the stability of
the gain measurements.

3 Single Photoelectron Re-

sponse

Figure 4 shows the typical charge
response for a PMT illuminated at a
light level of approximately 1 photo-
electron (p.e.) per pulse, with 10 000
pulses per histogram. The pedestal
peak can usually be distinguished
from the single–p.e. curve. The volt-
age is set to the “operating” high
voltage described in the following
section.

The relative RMS width of the 1–p.e.
peak is approximately 50% of the
mean charge. This large fractional
width is due in part to the ﬁnite
secondary emission ratio of the ﬁrst
dynode, and in part because the two
metal dynode channels in each pixel
will in general have slightly diﬀerent
gains. In addition to these eﬀects, the
electronics resolution broadens the
distribution by an additional ∼8%.

A good ﬁt to the single-p.e. charge
spectra was achieved with Eq. (1).
First, the mean number of photo-
electrons N pe was used to create a

6

Poisson distribution of n photoelec-
trons P (n|N pe). Then,
for each n
photoelectrons, the distribution of m
secondary electrons was again chosen
as a Poisson distribution P (m|nǫ),
where nǫ represents the mean num-
ber of secondary electrons. Each
value of m is in turn represented by
a Gaussian of peak position mge/ǫ
and width qm/ǫ(ge/ǫ), where m is
the number of secondary photoelec-
trons, g is the gain, e is the electron
charge, and ǫ is a ﬁt parameter de-
scribing the width of the single p.e.
peak. The parameter ǫ is analogous
to the secondary emission ratio of
the ﬁrst dynode, but cannot be inter-
preted as such due to the broadening
eﬀect of two dynode channels[18].

The measured spectra were ﬁt with a
Gaussian pedestal peak (with ﬁt pa-
rameters of mean, width, and inte-
gral) plus the single-p.e. shape given
by Eq. 1 (with ﬁt parameters N pe, ǫ
and g).

Using the ﬁt values of g and ǫ, the
fractional width of the single-p.e.
peak was characterized. The aver-
age RMS width of all pixels was
43% ± 6% of the peak position. (This
corresponds to ǫ = 5.4 ± 1.2.) The
most extreme pixels had widths as
high as 58% and as low as 35%.

Five of the 231 PMTs were rejected
from the sample for having poor

spectra.

4 Gains, Eﬃciencies, and Pixel

Uniformity

To test the pixel gains and eﬃcien-
cies, 10 000 light injections were per-
formed on each pixel at a light level
of approximately 10 p.e. per pulse.
Photon statistics were used to ﬁnd
gain and eﬃciency; that is, the width
of the charge distribution at a sin-
gle light level is due to the Poisson
ﬂuctuation in the number of photo-
electrons created at the cathode plus
the width of the single-p.e. distribu-
tion and the pedestal width. Equa-
tions (2) and (3) were used to ﬁnd
the gain g and the mean number of
p.e. per pulse N pe using the mean and
RMS of the charge distribution.

Here, Q was the mean charge of
the distribution, σQ was the RMS
of the charge distribution, σped was
the electronics resolution (i.e. the
pedestal width), and w was the frac-
tional RMS width of the single-pe
distribution.

The electronics resolution σped was
typically about 13 fC. For each pixel,
the fractional single-p.e. width w was
taken to be 50%; this simpliﬁcation
created a systematic error on g and
N pe of only a few percent, similar to
the statistical error. Measurements
of the gain and eﬃciency by this
method agreed well with the results
from the single-p.e. ﬁts described in
section 3.

The gain of the PMTs were measured
at 750, 800, 850, 900, and 950 V.
The mean gain of the 64 pixels at
each voltage was calculated and ﬁt to
a second-order polynomial for each
PMT. One such ﬁt is shown in Fig-
ure 5. A operating voltage was found
for each PMT such that the mean
gain was 0.8 × 106. The typical slope
of the gain curve near the operating
HV (expected to be ∆g
for
12 dynode stages) was 1.5%/V. The
distribution of operating voltages for
our sample is shown in Figure 6. All
subsequent measurements were per-
formed at these operating voltages.

the lowest gains on the PMT. (These
pixels had larger sensitive photo-

charge response of the pixels may be
more uniform in applications other
than ﬁbre readout.) The high–gain
pixels near the bottom of the ﬁgure
are near a small vent used to evapo-
rate the photocathode material dur-

this was related to the gain pattern.

measured photoelectrons (for a given
light level) could be compared be-
tween PMTs. The monitor PMT was
used to correct for changes in the
LED light level to within one per-
cent. The number of p.e. could then
be used to compute the “eﬀective
eﬃciency”, meaning the product of
quantum eﬃciency and collection ef-
ﬁciency integrated over the spectrum
of light shown in Figure 3. This eﬀec-
tive eﬃciency was normalized to the
520 nm quantum eﬃciency of three
PMTs evaluated by Hamamatsu to
scale to an approximate absolute
eﬃciency.

The eﬃciency of pixels on a given
PMT was more uniform than gain,
typically within 10% RMS over 64
pixels. Figure 10 shows the relative
eﬃciencies for all the pixels in the
sample. In contrast to the gain mea-
surement, there was no pattern in the
eﬃciencies of pixels at diﬀerent posi-
tions.

Fig. 10. Eﬀective pixel eﬃciencies. One
entry in this histogram corresponds to
one pixel for each of the 219 PMTs in
the sample, where each PMT was set to
the operating high voltage. The abscissa
is normalized to the quantum eﬃciency
of three reference PMTs at 520 nm to
give an approximate measure of abso-
lute eﬃciency.

Six PMTs were rejected from the
sample for having poor inter-pixel
uniformity. One or more pixels on
each of these PMTs had low gain
and sometimes low eﬃciency as well,
creating an unacceptable overall re-
sponse. These pixels were frequently
pixels 1–8 or 57–64, the low-gain
columns shown in Figure 9.

calculating the incident light level
for a diﬀerent ﬁlter by using the rel-
ative ﬁlter opacities. 6 The expected
charge for a given pixel was taken
as the incident light times the gain
times the eﬃciency of the pixel.

The magnitude of the nonlinearity
varied greatly between pixels. The
size of the bars in Figure 11 indi-
cate the RMS spread of pixels for
the given charge (including a ∼1%
statistical error). This variance can
be seen more directly in Figure 12,
which indicates the illuminated light
level at which pixels become nonlin-
ear. Some pixels remain linear up to
350 p.e., while others become non-
linear at only 70-100 p.e.

For the purposes of MINOS, where
signals are expected to be approxi-
mately 5 p.e. (for muon tracks) to
100 p.e. (for dense electron showers),
these nonlinearities are acceptable.
(An in-situ measurement of the non-
linearity will be done in MINOS to
ensure accurate calorimetry.[16])

5 Linearity

6 Crosstalk

The small size of the dynodes in an
M64 led to a concern that space-
charge eﬀects would be large enough
to induce nonlinearity at moderate
light levels. Figure 11 shows the non-
linearity of pulses in the region from
∼1000 to 70000 fC. The true inten-
sity of light (in p.e. per pulse) was
calculated by assuming the PMTs
to be linear when illuminated with
a ﬁlter to provide 15 p.e, and then

Crosstalk was measured in the test
stand by recording the integrated
charge on non-illuminated pixels
while light was injected onto one
pixel. Seven light levels between 10
and 200 p.e. were used.

6 Relative ﬁlter opacities were mea-
sured in situ by illuminating the LED
with DC and measuring the green light
with a photodiode.

The crosstalk within the readout
electronics was small. The fraction of
charge leaked to non-injected pixels
4
was measured to be less than 6×10−
4 between each
and typically 2 × 10−
pair of pixels. This contribution ac-

11

counts for only a small proportion of
the crosstalk observed.

Crosstalk between pixels on the PMT
occurs by two diﬀerent mechanisms.
The ﬁrst form, “optical” crosstalk,
is attributed to primary photoelec-
trons getting multiplied in the wrong
pixel’s dynode chain and thus giv-
ing a 1–p.e. signal in the wrong an-
ode. The second form, “electrical”
crosstalk, is attributed to electrons
leaking from one dynode chain to an-
other near the bottom of the chain,
resulting in a small fraction of the
injected pixel’s charge moving to the
wrong dynode channel or anode.

The non-illuminated pixels showed
a small charge on every pulse that
was proportional to the charge seen
in the injected pixel (i.e. “electrical”
crosstalk), and occasionally an ad-
ditional large charge consistent with
a single photoelectron (i.e. “optical”
crosstalk). The crosstalk was pa-
rameterized for every pair of pixels
for every PMT measured in the test
stand. Electrical crosstalk was pa-
rameterized as the fraction of charge
in the injected pixel that was leaked
to the non-injected pixel. This was
found by observing the shift in the
pedestal peak of the non-injected
pixel. Optical crosstalk was parame-
terized as the fractional probability
that a given photoelectron would
create a signal in the non-injected
pixel. Optical crosstalk was found by
counting the number of single-p.e.
hits in the crosstalk pixel. For both
these mechanisms, the mean charge
seen in the crosstalk pixel was pro-
portional to the charge seen in the
illuminated pixel.

A complete model was built by mea-
suring crosstalk over diﬀerent light
levels and diﬀerent PMTs. Both elec-
trical crosstalk fraction and optical
crosstalk probability were constant
with diﬀerent intensities of injected
light. In general, the crosstalk aver-
ages were consistent between diﬀer-
ent PMTs to within about 20%. The
values shown below are taken as the
average over all light levels.

Crosstalk was strongest between ad-
jacent pixels, but was not limited
to this case. Tables 2 and 3 show
the fractions of charge that were
crosstalked by each of the two mecha-
nisms for the nearest 8 pixels. In sum-
mary, approximately 2% of charge in
the injected pixel was leaked by elec-
trical crosstalk, and approximately
4% of the photons incident on the
injected pixel were detected on the
wrong anode. The precision of the
values reﬂects only statistical errors,
which were small. Systematic errors
on the values in Tables 2 and 3 are
about 20%. Poor accuracy was due
to the diﬃculty in separating the
two small crosstalk signals. However,
the total crosstalk (optical + electri-
cal) could be accurately measured as
6.9% for the whole sample.

In experiments where single-photon
response is important the optical
crosstalk mechanism dominates. For
instance, a signal of a single photo-
electron will appear to be on the in-
correct pixel 4% of the time, leading
to possible problems in interpreta-
tion of the data. For large quantities
of light the stochastic eﬀects of the
optical crosstalk average out so that
crosstalk is a simple fraction of the

7 Dark Noise

M64s were tested for dark noise by
taking data with no light on the
PMT, with the a high voltage of
950 V. The readout system was

12

pulsed 4×107 times, for an integrated
charge-collection time of 44 seconds.
Rate was determined by counting
the number of readouts for which the
integrated charge was greater than a
threshold, deﬁned as one-third of a
p.e. for the lowest-gain pixel on that
PMT. Before conducting the dark
noise measurement, the PMTs were
under high voltage and exposed to
no light for a minimum of 12 hours.
The dark noise measurement itself
was conducted over two days. The
ambient temperature was controlled
to be at 20 ± 2 C.

MINOS speciﬁed that PMTs should
have total anode noise rates (for all
64 pixels) of less than 2 kHz, but the
rates measured for most PMTs were
far lower. The average noise rate was
260 Hz per PMT. Approximately
10% of the PMTs had noise rates
greater than 500 Hz; approximately
5% had rates greater than 1000 Hz.
Two PMTs were rejected from the
sample for very high noise rates. The
spectra of noise pulses was consistent
with a single photoelectron spec-
trum. It was frequently found that
a single pixel would be considerably
more noisy than all the others on a
PMT; the noisiest pixel contributed
on average approximately one third
of the total dark noise.

In MINOS, the PMT readout is trig-
gered by a discriminator connected
to the tap on the 12th dynode. The
signal from this dynode is similar to
an analog sum of the individual pixel
signals. The rate of pulses on this
dynode, using a threshold equivalent
to the 1/3 of a p.e. on the lowest-gain
pixel, was found to give consistent

results with the method described
above.

8 Conclusions

We have found that M64s may be
used to provide good measurement
of light from wavelength-shifting op-
tical ﬁbres for intensities of 1–100
p.e., the measurement of interest to
MINOS. The variance in gain be-
tween pixels on a PMT is 25% RMS.
Quantum eﬃciency is similar be-
tween PMTs. Excepting a handful of
rejected PMTs, the single-p.e. peak
was well-resolved from the pedestal
at our operating voltage. The PMTs
are typically linear for pulses less
than 100 p.e. at 8 × 105 gain (i.e.
13 000 fC), and are comparable to
the 16-pixel R5900-00-M16 PMTs[3].
The M64s have low dark noise, typ-
ically 4 Hz per pixel, due to their
small pixel area.

Crosstalk in M64s can be a signiﬁ-
cant problem, particularly if they are
used to count single photons since
photoelectrons can get collected by
the wrong dynode. However, if typ-
ical signals are larger, and pixel oc-
cupancy small, the adjacent crosstalk
signals are easily identiﬁed.

In each of the studies described above
(single-p.e. response, uniformity, lin-
earity, crosstalk, and dark noise) no
signiﬁcant variation was seen be-
tween diﬀerent delivery batches, or
between the R5900 and R7600 mod-
els.

We have found M64 PMTs to meet or

13

surpass requirements for reading out
scintillator with wavelength-shifting
ﬁbres. A total of about 5% of PMTs
were rejected for not meeting these
requirements. The MINOS near de-
tector, under construction at the
time of this writing, will be employ-
ing these devices on a large scale.

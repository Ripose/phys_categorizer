Abstract

Crystals are used as a homogeneous calorimetric medium in many high-energy physics experiments.
For some experiments, performance has to be ensured in very difﬁcult operating conditions, like a
high radiation environment, very large particle ﬂuxes, high collision rates, placing constraints on re-
sponse and readout time. An overview is presented of recent achievements in the ﬁeld, with particular
attention given to the performance of Lead Tungstate (PWO) crystals exposed to high particle ﬂuxes.

This report is a brief overview on the existing knowledge about scintillating crystals performance, when they are
used for high-energy physics calorimetry, with particular attention given to the behavior under high radiation levels
and intense particle ﬂuxes. The way high ionizing radiation levels affect crystal performance will only be brieﬂy
summarized, since it has been thoroughly studied and reported upon by many authors in the past, as crystals were
used e.g. in e+e− collider experiments, and their growth parameters were optimized for best performance in such
environments. Today’s renewed concern deals with crystals exposed to high particle ﬂuxes, running conditions
expected in several experiments under construction or designed, such as hadron collider detectors. Some recent
and older results are thus collected herein, to provide, as far as possible, a complete picture.

Ionizing radiation produces absorption bands through formation of color centers, which reduce the Light Transmis-
sion (LT) and thus the Light Output (LO), whose importance is related to oxygen contamination in alkali halides
like BaF2 and CsI, and to oxygen vacancies and impurities in oxides like BGO and PWO [1]. Phosphorence or
afterglow may also appear [2], which increase the noise levels in the detected light, possibly worsening the en-
ergy resolution (in a negligible way for PWO in LHC experiments [3]), while the scintillation mechanism is not
damaged. Recovery of damage at room temperature can occur depending on crystal type, and growth parameters,
giving rise to a dose-rate dependence of damage equilibrium levels [4], and to a recovery speed dependent on the
depth of traps. That ionising radiation only affects LT, means the damage can be monitored through light injection
and corrected for, as it is done in the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) [5].

The way hadron ﬂuxes affect crystals has been studied to a lesser extent, but crucial questions arise while detectors
are being constructed, namely, whether such ﬂuxes cause a speciﬁc, possibly cumulative damage, and if so, what
its quantitative importance is, whether it only affects LT or also the scintillation mechanism. Tests were recently
performed on PWO at IHEP Protvino [6] for the BTeV experiment and at CERN and ETH-Z¨urich [7] for the CMS
ECAL.

In BTeV, 94% of the crystals will see relatively low particle ﬂuxes, corresponding to ionizing dose rates below 36
rad/h and doses up to 100 krad/y, while at the other end, 0.5 % of the crystals will experience high ﬂuxes (∼ 200
rad/h and beyond, up to 2 Mrad/y). These regimes were tested in crystals using e− and π beams and γ sources up
to a few krad at 1 to 60 rad/h at one end, and a very intense mixed beam of charged hadrons, neutrons and γ up to
3 Mrad at 1 krad/h and 100 krad/h equivalent ﬂuxes at the other end. In e−, π and γ irradiations, the signal loss
behavior is qualitatively similar between electrons and pions, and the damage appears to reach equilibrium at a
dose-rate dependent level. Furthermore, no indication of damage to the scintillation mechanism from π irradiation
is found [8]. A concern remains however, that for the dose-rates used, the total absorbed dose expected in the
experiment is not explored and thus an additional, speciﬁc, possibly cumulative damage from hadrons cannot
be excluded. This concern is partially answered by the irradiations in the very intense, mixed beam, where the
absorbed doses correspond to 3 y running for the most exposed crystals, yielding thus an upper limit to the damage
expected in the experiment. At the constant ﬂux used, the damage appears in fact to be steadily increasing with
accumulated dose. This is unlike pure ionizing radiation damage, which reaches equilibrium at a level depending
on dose rate, not beyond what saturation of all color centers can yield, and thus it constitutes an indication for an
additional, cumulative, hadron-speciﬁc damage.

For CMS, hadron ﬂuences have been calculated [7] for 5 × 105 pb
ECAL barrel (end caps) ∼ 1012 (∼ 1014) cm−2 . Hadron-speciﬁc damage could be due to the production, above
a ∼ 20 MeV threshold, of heavy fragments (“stars”), with up to 10 µm range and energies up to ∼100 MeV, which
cause displacement of lattice atoms and energy losses along their path up to 10000 × the one of minimum-ionizing
particles. The damage caused by these processes is likely different from the one of ionizing radiation, thus possibly
cumulative. The primarily investigated quantity was the induced absorption coefﬁcient at peak-of-emission wave-
length, deﬁned as µIN D(440 nm) = 1
LT , with LT0 and LT the longitudinal transmission at 440 nm before
and after irradiation, respectively, measured through the crystal length L. Transmission measurements are very
accurate and directly related to LO changes provided scintillation is not affected. For CMS production crystals,
µIN D(440nm) = 1 m−1 corresponds to a relative LO loss of 25% [9].
Several CMS production crystals of consistent quality1) were irradiated in a 20 GeV proton ﬂux of 1012 p/cm2/h
(a,b,c,d) and a few more (E, F, G) in 1013 p/cm2/h. The LT data in Fig. 1(a) show a possible ﬂux dependence at
low ﬂuence, no ﬂux dependence at high ﬂuence and a transmission band-edge shift, unlike what happens in purely
ionizing radiation [1]. The correlation in Fig. 1(b), between µIN D(440nm) and ﬂuence, is consistent with a linear
behavior, showing that proton-induced damage in PWO appears to predominantly yield a cumulative effect. Taking
into account the difference in composition and energy spectra between 20 GeV protons and CMS, the test results

the CMS running conditions over the entire high-precision
ECAL pseudo-rapidity region, up to ∼ 2.9.

Proton and γ data are compared in a study performed on
BGO [10]. The changes in band-edge are similar to what
is seen in PWO, and long enough after irradiation, when the
ionising-radiation damage contribution has recovered, one can
extract a remaining p-damage that behaves linearly with ﬂu-
ence, as visible in Fig. 2. The same exercise is not possible
on CsI data from the same authors [11] because the damage
caused by ionizing radiation gives a too important constribu-
tion to allow observing the proton-speciﬁc one.

In conclusion, one can say that for all crystals commonly used
in calorimetry, beyond the well-studied damage from ionizing
radiation, the understanding of additional contributions to the
damage, when crystals experience a substantial hadron ﬂux,
has become important since experiments are being built hav-
ing to cope with such running conditions. A hadron-speciﬁc, cumulative contribution, likely due to the intense local
energy deposition from heavy fragments, has been observed in tests on PWO and BGO. Within the explored ﬂux
and ﬂuence ranges, this contribution only seems to affect Light Transmission, and thus can be monitored. Addi-
tional studies, taking into account the range of operation of the envisaged experiments, are expected to consolidate
the present understanding of hadron damage.

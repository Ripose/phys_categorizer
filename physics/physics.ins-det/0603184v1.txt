Abstract

We report on a scheme for highly eﬃcient detection of single microwave photons,
with application to detecting certain exotic particles such as the axion. This scheme
utilises an experiment known as the micromaser and the phenomenon of trapping
states to amplify the signal and produce a cascade of detector counts in a ﬁeld
ionization detector. The cascade provides a time-resolved signal marking the pres-
ence of a single photon. For experimentally achievable parameters, the detection
eﬃciency exceeds 90%.

Reliable rare-event detection is vital in many ﬁelds of physics, especially in par-
ticle physics where there is a real need to observe the existence of rare or weakly
interacting particles. One such particle that has received much attention is the
axion (1), which is predicted to have a mass equivalent to a microwave pho-
ton. While it is very diﬃcult to detect the axion directly schemes do exist for
converting these particles into microwave photons via the Primakoﬀ process
(2; 3) where the problem becomes one of detecting the subsequent microwave
photon. The use of Rydberg atoms in single microwave photon detectors (4; 5)
is an attractive prospect for this purpose since it is experimentally easier to
detect the eﬀect of the photons on atoms than the photons themselves. The
typical method for detecting whether a Rydberg atom has absorbed or emitted
a microwave photon is using “state selective ﬁeld ionization” (6), where the
atoms are subjected to a varying electric ﬁeld that ionizes them in a position
dependent upon their state. Detecting a single atom in an altered state reveals
the presence of a photon. However, the nature of these detectors is such that
a number of eﬀects will produce detector clicks that have nothing to do with
a signal and are unavoidable in practice. This has important practical impli-
cations when trying to resolve a single detection event (5) in the presence of
background thermal noise.

The scheme proposed in this paper produces a signal that can be discrimi-
nated from single clicks arising from random clicks unconnected with a signal,
as the arrival of a single photon triggers a cascade of detector clicks. The mi-
crowave photon detection eﬃciency approaches 100% and is also inherently
more robust to dark counts (counts in the absence of signal), missed counts
(due to ﬁnite detector eﬃciency) and mis-counts (arising from detector cross
talk). This method of detection is based on a quantum mechanical eﬀect called
zero photon population trapping in the micromaser (7; 8; 9). The micromaser
plays the role of an ultrasensitive microwave detector for axions created in an
ancillary conversion chamber (5; 10). Mode matching between the two cavi-
ties would provide eﬃcient coupling to any type of axion conversion chamber
and therefore we will not comment on the structure of the conversion cham-
ber itself. We will instead concentrate this discussion on the structure of the
detector itself and describe how it achieves a high detection eﬃciency.

The micromaser (11) is a cavity QED experiment in which we use supercon-
1010 (single photon
ducting microwave cavities with a Q-factors up to 5
lifetime of around 0.4s), through which we pass a sequence of two level atoms
that interact one at a time with a single mode of the cavity. The atoms are
prepared initially in their excited state and the transition between the two
states is resonant with the cavity. The atoms are very strongly coupled to
the cavity mode, therefore allowing a maser ﬁeld to be produced with only
one atom passing through the cavity at a time. While the microwave photons
themselves cannot be detected, the atoms can, so we are able to derive a great
deal of information about the ﬁeld from the atoms emerging from the cavity.
The micromaser has already been used to observe the appearance of single
quanta and as a triggerable source of single microwave quanta (12) and can
be used as a microwave photon detector via population trapping states. They
occur when the cavity state is trapped and emission of the incident atoms is
forbidden until the arrival (by some other means) of a single photon, causing
a cascade of emission events. Thus the single photon is massively ampliﬁed by
the micromaser. This occurs regardless of the atomic pump rate, which can
be up to several thousand atoms per second. When a single photon enters the
cavity the conditions change from destructive to constructive interference and
emission probability can rise to nearly 100%. Thus the rate of emission events
can go from zero to thousands per second on the arrival of one photon.

Figure 1 shows the experimental operation of the micromaser. Rubidium atoms
are emitted from an oven in their ground state (unﬁlled circles) in a highly
collimated beam. A laser excites these atoms to the 63P3/2 Rydberg state

to the atomic beam to allow velocity selection via Doppler detuning. A typical
velocity resolution of 0.5% is achievable with current techniques. The excited
atoms enter the high-Q superconducting cavity and interact resonantly with a
single mode (typically the TE121 mode) of the resonator. This interaction is (to
a very good approximation) described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian

erators. This is one of the simplest Hamiltonians in quantum optics, describing
the interaction of a single two-level atom with a single ﬁeld mode. There are
no loss mechanisms in this ideal model, but since the interaction time is 3–4
orders of magnitude smaller than the time scales for losses (the micromaser
cavity has a Q-factor of up to 5

1010), this is an excellent approximation.

During the interaction, the system undergoes Rabi oscillations between the

by state selective ﬁeld ionization, giving us information about the ﬁeld. The
probability that an atom emits a photon into the cavity is given by

where τ is the interaction time and n is the number of photons already in the

to zero, which can be understood as the system undergoing an integer number

of Rabi oscillations,

τ =

where k is an integer. If equation 3 is fulﬁlled, then the cavity ﬁeld is trapped
with n photons and has zero probability of progressing to n + 1, which is
possible even for n = 0 (known as the vacuum trapping state). Such trapping
states have been experimentally observed (7; 8). By starting in the vacuum
state (which is ensured by cooling the cavity to around 40mK) and appropri-
ately tuning the velocity (and hence the interaction time) according to the
value for the vacuum trapping state, emission is forbidden and atoms are un-
able to emit photons. However, if n = 1, the probability of emission at the
same velocity is close to 93%. Thus the addition of one photon has a dramatic
eﬀect on emission probability and the count rate in the
detector goes from
zero to a detectably high number, indicating the arrival of a single photon
in the cavity. Subsequent emission events change the emission probability via
equation 2. These probabilities mean that the arrival of a single photon in the
cavity by any mechanism causes the system to jump past the vacuum trapping
state, giving a cascade of
detector counts. This is the signature of a single
i
photon arriving in the cavity.

The proposed experimental conﬁguration is similar to that in (5), with the
detection cavity replaced by the micromaser system presented here.

To examine the eﬀectiveness of this scheme, we have employed a Quantum
Trajectory Analysis method to simulate detection records of the system. This
technique involves stochastically evolving a wavefunction using a combination
of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and a set of “jump operators”. Quantum
trajectory analysis is often used to calculate an approximation to the density
matrix of a system, but here individual trajectories are used to simulate de-
tection records from the experiment. The implementation of the method here
is based upon that in (14). The non-Hermitian eﬀective Hamiltonian is given

is the operator representing an atom introducing a photon into the ﬁeld that
contains n photons, and

is the operator representing a photon being gained from the reservoir. How-
ever, since every operator maps pure states onto pure states, and for our
purposes we always begin with the (pure) vacuum state, then we can reduce
the dynamics simply to jumps occurring stochastically and the wavefunction
remaining unchanged in between.

A quantum trajectory simulation of the micromaser operating in the vacuum
trapping state was performed, in which the ground state detector count (the
rate of occurence of jump ˆC2) was monitored while single photons were added
to the cavity at random times. Figure 2 shows an example trajectory for the
ideal case, with no deviation from perfect operating conditions, in order to
illustrate the principle of the operation of the detector. It shows how the ﬁeld
evolves inside the cavity, along with the detector clicks we see when probing
the atoms.

Here we see that, for suﬃciently high atomic pump rates, once the vacuum
trapping state is passed then the ﬁeld very quickly reaches three photons,
which also gives a zero emission probability and becomes trapped again (this
is the n = 3, k = 2 trapping state, eq. 3). The ﬁeld then proceeds to rapidly
oscillate between this and the two and one photon states (due to decay from
the cavity), giving rise to the high count rate. We see that adding just one
photon at around t = 1.25s produces a detector count rate of up to around 45
counts per second, which is easily detectable, even with imperfect detectors.
Notice that, for a typical microwave frequency of around 21.5GHz, as used in
current micromaser experiments, this amounts to near perfect detection of an
energy change of less than 90µeV .

Figure 3 shows how the detection eﬃciency depends upon the pump rate R.
This simulation was performed by introducing a single photon into the cavity

To be more realistic, however, it is possible to include a number of departures
from the ideal conditions in the quantum trajectory method to investigate the
limits imposed on the system by these factors. For example, a more complete
model of this system includes practical limitations of the system. Dark Counts
are caused by detector clicks occurring by means other than ionization of the
rubidium atoms (for example simple thermal excitation in the detector or
cosmic rays passing through the detector), leading to non-zero count rates
when no atoms are present, giving a Poisson distributed background level.
High quality electron multipliers reduce this rate to around 3 counts per second
or less. Missed Counts arise when an atom is not ionized at all in the ﬁeld
ionization region, or when the liberated electron does not reach the electron

multiplier. Detector Crosstalk occurs when an atom is ionized at the wrong
detector, leading to errors in the statistics of the detected atoms.

All of these errors are incorporated into the model by means of setting the
detector eﬃciencies ηg < 1 and ηe < 1 for the ground and excited state detec-
tors respectively and adding a random background generated with a poisso-
nian distribution centred at rb counts/second to simulate the dark counts and
crosstalk.

Other errors in the system arise from the departure from ideal operating con-
ditions of the micromaser. The idealised model assumes that there is no spread
in interaction time τ , the coupling parameter g is constant and that there is
never more than one atom in the cavity at any time. In practice, we ﬁnd that,
due to the linewidths of the velocity selecting laser and atomic transition, the
interaction time has a non-zero spread. Mechanical vibrations in the system
may also cause variations in the parameter g. Hence we replace g and τ with
φ = gτ , drawn from a normal distribution centred at φ0 = π with spread
∆φ to represent these eﬀects. Perhaps the major source of error, however, is
the occurrence of multi-atom events. When there is more than one atom in
the cavity, equation 1 no longer holds, and the more complicated interaction
has a high probability of breaking the trapping state barrier and causing an
erroneous detection event. The probability of an atom contributing to a single
atom event is given by P = e−2Rτ , which gives a maximum rate of 62s−1 for a
99% probability of one atom events at our vacuum trapping state. This eﬀect
is easily included in the simulation by monitoring the time between incident
atoms. If two or more are present in the cavity, then the trapping state is
broken by the addition of one or two photons.

Fig. 6. Plot showing the composition of background counts. The lower portion rep-
resents the noise rate due to multi-atom events and the upper portion that of the
ﬁnite velocity spread.

We now see that the detection eﬃciency increases with increasing pump rate,
but that the background counts also increase, due to the higher probability
of two-atom events and outliers in the velocity distribution that disrupt the
trapping state. This clearly aﬀects the signal to noise ratio, and by plugging
in real experimental numbers for our errors we can easily predict the optimum
operating conditions to maximise our signal to noise ratio.

Figure 6 shows that, for experimentally realistic parameters, multi-atom eﬀects
are the largest single source of noise. The eﬀect of these multi-atom events can
be reduced by increasing the coupling g, and hence reducing τ , or altering the
distribution of incoming atoms. In the limit of uniform atomic spacing, for
example, we can in principle achieve an upper limit of R = τ −1
104 (a
promising method of altering the distribution is currently being investigated).

In this paper we have shown that it is possible to massively amplify the char-
acteristic signal of a single microwave photon to a level where it is easily mea-
surable with current detector technology. Furthermore, the theoretical model
presented here can be used to decide the particular operating parameters for
optimal performance.

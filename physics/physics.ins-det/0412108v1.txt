Based on a novel shower reconstruction algorithm, the study of two particle sepa-
ration with tile hadron calorimeter (HCAL) is performed. The separability of two
close-by particles is found to be strongly dependent on transverse and longitudinal
segmentation of tile HCAL.

1 Introduction

Event reconstruction in a future linear e+e− collider experiment will be based
on a particle ﬂow concept 1 aiming at reconstruction of every single particle
in an event. Clearly, performance of the particle ﬂow algorithm will strongly
depend on its capability to separate two and more close-by showers.
In its
turn particle separation capability will be inﬂuenced by transverse and longi-
tudinal segmentation of calorimeters. In this note we investigate the impact of
transverse and longitudinal segmentation of hadron calorimeter on two parti-
cle separation. The study is based on a novel shower reconstruction algorithm
which makes use of ﬁnely granulated electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters
foreseen for a linear collider detector.

2 Simulation

The detector setup used in our simulation closely follows the calorimeter de-
sign outlined in the TESLA Technical Design report 2. The elecromagnetic
calorimeter consists of tungsten absorbers interspersed with silicon diod pads
and is characterised by a very high granularity. The transverse size of the
readout cell is 1×1 cm2. The hadron calorimeter represents an analog de-
vice, consisting of stainless steel absorber plates interspersed with scintillating
tiles. Calorimeter parameters are given in Table 1. In our studies calorimeter
response has been simulated using the GEANT3 package 3. Hadronic inter-
actions are simulated using FLUKA 4 complemented with low energy neutron
transport code MICAP 5.

Several options of transverse granularity of HCAL have been considered:
1×1, 3×3 and 5×5 cm2. For the 3×3 cm2 tile size, the readout scheme with
each two adjacent layers joined in depth is also considered. The inﬂuence of
transverse tile size is studied using a recently developed shower reconstruction
procedure which takes advantage of the ﬁne granularity of calorimeters.

3 Clustering

Before describing clustering and the shower reconstruction procedure, some
deﬁnitions need to be introduced. By clusters we mean internal structures
inside shower, e.g. pieces of tracks produced by minimal ionising particles,
electromagnetic subshowers originated from neutral pions or set of adjacent
hits produced by several charged particles in the vicinity of nuclear interac-
tion points. The shower is then viewed as a group of topologically connected
clusters.

Clustering begins with the hit classiﬁcation procedure based on the en-
ergy of each hit. Hits with energy deposit greater than half a MIP signal and
less than 1.7 MIPs are assigned for the so called ”track–like” category. Hits
with an extremely dense energy deposit exceeding 3.5 times MIP expectation,
are considered as relics of electromagnetic activity. Finally, hits with energy
deposit ranging from 1.7 to 3.5 MIPs are assigned for ”hadron–like” category.
Hit classiﬁcation is illustrated in Figure 1. At the next stage, the clustering
procedure based on 3D pattern recognition is performed and clusters are classi-
ﬁed into diﬀerent categories taking into account hit categorisation, topological
properties of clusters, their inter–relations and position in the calorimeter vol-
ume. The ”track–like” clusters are classiﬁed as having small eccentricity and
low hit density. The ”hadron–like” clusters have relatively large eccentricity
and low hit density. The ”electromagnetic–like” clusters have high hit density
and small eccentricity. An additional hit category is introduced by cluster-
ing. These are hits spatially disconnected from other clusters and presumably
initiated by neutrons, hence the name for this category: ”neutron–like” hits.

Such a clustering procedure results in separation of total energy into
diﬀerent components. Correlation between hadronic component, including
energy contained in the ”track–like”, ”hadron–like” clusters and ”neutron–
like” hits and electromagnetic component, including energy contained in the
”electromagnetic–like” showers, is illustrated in Figure 2. The reconstructed
energy distribution of a 10 GeV π+ shower after dedicated energy correction
procedure similar to that used by DREAM collaboration 6 is presented in Fig-
ure 3. This energy correction procedure is based on individual weighting of
hadronic and electromagnetic components of the shower energy and uses a
priori knowledge of the π+ beam energy. Such an approach is obviously non-
Bayesian and Figure 3 indicates only the degree of correlation between mea-
sured hadronic and electromagnetic components of the shower energy rather
than realistically achievable energy resolution.

4 Shower Reconstruction

Once clustering is performed, showers are reconstructed by building a ”tree”
of ”electromagnetic–like” and ”hadron–like” clusters connected by ”track–like”
clusters. ”Neutron–like” hits and clusters disconnected from the main tree are
added to shower if their distance to the shower axis is less than some cut
parameter, Dcut. Shower axis is deﬁned at each step of the shower building

process as the main principle axis of inertia tensor associated with shower.
For showers produced by charged particles, the cluster nearest to the track
intersection point with the ECAL front plane seeds the shower. Furthermore,
for showers initiated by charged particles, parameter Dcut is adjusted itera-
tively during the process of shower building until the energy contained in the
reconstructed shower matches the best the momentum of the associated track.
Typical value of Dcut ranges from 1 to 3 cm.

5 Two Particle Separation

To estimate shower separation performance we simulated the response of the
S and π+, which
electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters to two particles, K 0
are normally incident at the ECAL front plane. Our preliminary study did
not take into account the eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld. The momentum of π+
and its trajectory are assumed to be precisely measured with an inner tracking
system. The particle separation performance is estimated as a function of
distance between two particles. Figure 4 presents an example of two resolved
showers initiated by K 0
S and π+ with an energy of 5 GeV each. Figure 5 shows
the distribution of the reconstructed energy of the neutral shower produced
by a 10 GeV K 0
L in the proximity of the shower produced by a 10 GeV π+.
The distance between the two particles is 7cm. Distributions are shown for
two options of transverse segmentation of an analog HCAL, 3×3 and 5×5

cm2. The reference energy distribution obtained for a 10 GeV K 0
L shower in
the absence of any nearby shower is also shown. Performance is quantiﬁed in
terms of particle separation quality deﬁned as a fraction of events in which
the reconstructed energy of a neutral shower lies in the interval Etrue ± 3σ,
where Etrue is the true energy of K 0
L and σ is the nominal energy resolution.
The separation quality is found to be hihgly sensitive to both transverse and
longitudinal segmentation of the HCAL as demonstrated in Figure 6. An
independent approach of shower separation based on an alternative clustering
method with minimal spanning trees gives comparable results for a digital
calorimeter with 1×1 cm2 RPC cell size 7.

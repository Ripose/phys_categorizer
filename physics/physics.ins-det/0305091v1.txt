Abstract

The FORG 1 opeeration principle uses a recirculating ring resonant cavity to get a rotation-
induced Sagnac eﬀect enhancement [1].
It grants to a FORG a comparable sensitivity in relation
an I-FOG 2that has the ﬁber lenght ℑ/2 times longer, where ℑ is equal its ﬁnesse factor. Other
advantages is despite of thermal drift because the FORG uses less quantity of ﬁbre than the I-FOG,
giving to the ﬁrst less thermal drift sensitivity than the last. But, due to the Kerr eﬀect and couplers
loss, that causes parasitics eﬀects like dissimetries on signal response [2] and cross polarization. due
to these facts, the FORG complexity is increased a lot. The signal response dissimetry caused by
kerr eﬀect can be corrected by phase nulling method, was proposed by Hotate [3]. The proposal of
this work is to show a applied to a FORG technique that simpliﬁes the signal treatment, employing
all digital setup, like as ﬁlter banks and wavelets methods, resulting in a maximally ﬂat scale factor.
In this investigation are presented over the simulations results, employing the modiﬁed digital FM
spectrometry techniques by decimation and interpolation techniques over a ring resonator that pursuit
a 10 meters SM-PM lenght ﬁber coil and 10 centimeters of diameter, with a 1.55µm laser source. The
advantages of these techniques are to simplify the electronic circuitry, oﬀering an upgrade facility,
using only one DSP (Digital Signal Processor), realizing all needed functions. The investigation of
this method is based in a optical ﬁeld switching scheme and digital frequency domain spectrometry.
The purpose of this work is to describe this digital technique, well as the simulation results, discussing
about this technique use and its limitations.

1. Introduction

The FORG operation principle is based on a recirculating light into the resonant cavity or a ﬁbre
ring resonator. It increases its sensitivity, enhancing the rotation induced Sagnac eﬀect [1] by a ℑ/2,
where ℑ is equal its ﬁnesse factor. In this work we intend to show one easy solution to signal process
employing less hardware. This technique employs light switching and digital frequency decimation
methods to get the rate measurement signal.

2. Theoretical Background

The proposed setup is depicted in ﬁgure 1, that uses two electro-optic modulators, one in each
Mach-Zehnder interferometer branch, each of wich working as an amplitude modulator (see ref.[9]
for more details). Jointly of these modulators, have two electronic switches working syncrinizatelly.
The polarization controllers and optical isolators had been supressed of ﬁg.1 for simplicity. The set
of equations that describe the FORG theory will be given in the following pharagraphs. The FORG
response equations can be found in reference [4], which will be given below.

equations are derived from coupling matrix, depicted in equation 5:

Pccw(Ω) − Pcw(Ω), and replacing the terms of φ(k) sines and cosines of equations 12 to 15 by equa-

The measured value of Ω is recursively computed using the priori values (at the k − 1 instant).

The modulator factor choice is very important because the unsuitable βm value can cause a great
overshoot, turning the system critically damped. In this work, the βm is determinated by simulation.
To correct the modulation factor, is needed to adjust the phase modulation driving ampliﬁer gain.

3. The Setup and Operation Principle

The operation principle is based on syncronization ﬁeld intensity combination, where the coun-
terpropagating ﬁelds intensity are digitally processed. These signals are sent to a processing block
separatelly into the time domain by the optical switch and electronic switch. Then, these signals are
combined by diﬀerence between them, cancelling the even powers of ΩR. The frequency decimation of
these signal have the ﬁnallity of eliminate the modulation frequency harmonics that simpliﬁes the pro-
cessing alghoritm. The system setup is depicted in ﬁgure 2, where : PD=photodiode, LD=laser diode,
PM=phase modulator, OS=optical switch, OC=optical coupler, BS=beam splitter, FOC=ﬁbre-optic
coil, PC=polarisation controller, OI=Optical isolator.

The correlation eﬀect and the oﬀset can be corrected by an additional photodiode elimination
and the employing of an optical switch pair (showed in ﬁgure 3), working syncronized with two CMOS
switches together by a clock pulse train (the optical switch operation principle is described in reference
[9]). These optical switches can be integrated in a LiN bO3 substrate. Each optical switch allows each
ﬁeld pass in a time interval equal of Ts
2 to the photodiode. The electrical switch scheme and electrical
signal conditioning setup is proposed in ﬁgure 4 and 5, respectively, where ∆Ik is the generated signal
diﬀerence by counterpropagating ﬁelds.

These optical switches provides a syncronizated signal diﬀerence with two CMOS switches, that
separate the Icw and Iccw from photodiode at several instants of Ts
2 . Note that the Iccw is delayed by
a time lack of Ts
2 . It is necessary that the Icw and Iccw signals arrive at same instant to the subtractor
to avoid the signal nulling in equation 35. These signals is subtacted one of each and decimated in
frequency, explaned already in equations 27 to 34. The diﬀerence signal is processed by a processing
algorithm, which matricial equation is described in equation 39. The modulating signal is used to
generate the calculation matrix coeﬃcients Γn
k after frequency decimation. The initial values is set
up to avoid overshoot. For small initial values, the overshoot reaches high values, otherwise, for high
initial values, the setting time becomes very long and the system turn very slow. The ideal values can
be foun by simulation. The best values of modulation factor βm minimizes the scale factor error and
serves to maintain the modulation range limit into the FSR 3 interval. The output can be sent to an
adaptive LMS ﬁlter algorithm (see reference [10]) to enhance the readout signal or at the digitalized
input signal, or a predictive Kalman ﬁlter (an LMS adaptive ﬁlter scheme for the enhancement signal
conﬁguration is depicted in ﬁgure 6).

4. Simulation Results

The simulations were made over a FORG wich uses a 10 meter lenght single mode, polarisation
maintaining, ﬁbre-optic, and 1.446 refraction index and 1.55µm source lenght. The loop has 10
centimeter diameter, and the phase modulator is working at the modulation frequency equal 5.186722
MHz over the modulation factor βm ≈ 1.7278759594 . The sampling frequency is 100 times greather
than the modulation frequency. These parameters yields a scale factor around of 1.18 × 10−3% at 20
radians per second is found. All these values are used in this work. The Signal response was plotted
at 20rad/sec rotation rate within 200 samples (see ﬁgure 7), where Iccw(k) counterclockwise signal
output, Icw(k) clockwise signal output, and signal diﬀerence. These signals had been measured before
pass by decimation frequency process.

In Figure 8, we can see the signal response at 20rad/sec rotation rate within 200 samples, where
Iccw(k) counterclockwise signal output, Icw(k) clockwise signal output, and signal diﬀerence. These
signals had been measured after pass by zero order holding and decimation frequency process, and in
the ﬁgure 9, we have the signal response at 20rad/sec rotation rate, the signal output at 200 samples,
and the signal’s FFT and phase response.

Reverting the rotation sense, note a signal response invertion (at -20rad/sec rotation rate: signal
output at 200 samples, FFT and phase response). Note the phase inversion in relation of the previous
ﬁgure. At -2rad/sec (depicted in ﬁgure 11, we get a signal response (showing signal output, FFT

3FSR: Free Spectral Range (see reference [9])

and phase response at 200 samples only), we can note that the FFT response varies proportionally
(compare with the previous ﬁgure). It shows that the alghoritm is working properly and the equations
showed in section 2 may appear valid.

But we can note the residual ripple due to the higher order expansion error approximation
too (see ﬁgure 12). These riple can be easily minimized by low pass digital ﬁltering. This ﬂuctuation
introduces a coloured noise, causing a bias drift at a mean value, masking the signal.

5. Conclusions

The use of an optical switching and digital frequency decimation can simplify the the optical
and electronic hardware, reducing the photodiode oﬀset, getting a signal directly proportional to the
rotation rate with sense information.
It can do the digital spectrometry processing method as an
useful way to improve a low cost resonant gyroscope performance using less ﬁber. In this technique,
the FORG performance is dependent of modulation factor βm, as well as the decimation factor M,
that smoot the response curve and reduces the processor’s calculations cost.

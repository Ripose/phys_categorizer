Abstract

The electro-magnetic calorimeter at the BABAR detector, part of the asymmetric
B Factory at SLAC, measures photons in the energy range from 20 MeV to 8 GeV
with good resolution. The calorimeter is calibrated at the low energy end with
6.13 MeV photons obtained from a liquid source system. During the calibration,
a ﬂuorine-rich liquid is activated via a neutron generator and pumped past the front
of the calorimeter’s crystals. Decays that occur in front of the crystals emit photons
of well-deﬁned energy, which are detected in the crystals with the regular data
acquisition system. The liquid source system adds only very little material in front
of the calorimeter, needs nearly no maintenance, and allows operation at the switch
of a key with minimal safety hazards. The report describes the system, presents
calibration results obtained from its operation since 1999, shows the crystals’ loss
of light yield due to radiation damage, and shares experiences gained over the years.

I. INTRODUCTION

S INCE 1999, the asymmetric B Factory at the Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) has been collecting
data from collisions of 9 GeV electrons and 3.1 GeV positrons.
The B mesons that are created at this 10.58 GeV center-of-
mass energy are the major topic of the physics studies at
the BABAR detector [1] which records the decay products of
the B mesons. The detection of photons and π0 mesons,
which mainly decay into photon pairs, with high efﬁciency
and good energy resolution is of utmost importance to the
physics program [2] [3]. This task is handled by the electro-
magnetic calorimeter (EMC) of the BABAR detector, designed
for the detection of photons in the energy range from 20 MeV to
8 GeV. The detector consists of 5760 CsI(Tl) crystals arranged
cylindrically in 48 rows along the polar angle (the so-called
“barrel”), and 820 CsI(Tl) crystals arranged in 8 rows at the
forward end of the detector (“endcap”), as illustrated in Figs. 1
and 2. Each crystal is of trapezoidal shape with a front face area
of approximately 47 mm ×47 mm and a length of 297.6 mm to
325.5 mm (16.0 to 17.5 radiation lengths).

II. REQUIREMENTS

In order to reach good energy resolution in the calorimeter,
accurate calibration of the crystals over the full energy range is
essential. Because radiation from the e+e− beams damages the
crystals over time, frequent calibrations are necessary to avoid
a drop in energy resolution. For lowest energies, this calibration
is achieved through the neutron-activated liquid-source system
that is the subject of this report. A calibration accuracy of
0.5% was required for the liquid source calibration system. For

III. APPARATUS AND CALIBRATION PROCEDURE

A. The Neutron Generator

The calibration relies on the reaction 19F + n → 16N + α
and the subsequent decay of 16N (T1/2 = 7 seconds) via 16O∗
into 16O and a 6.13 MeV photon. The neutrons originate from
a deuterium-tritium neutron generator ([5], Fig. 3) located in a
concrete bunker with approximately 0.8 m thick walls adjacent
to the BABAR detector. It provides 14 MeV neutrons with a
continuous ﬂux of up to 109 n/s when its high voltage is turned
on remotely. A bath (Fig. 4) surrounding the generator holds
FluorinertTM FC-77 [6], an inert ﬂuid rich in ﬂuorine that the
neutrons activate to 16N.

B. The Tube System

A pump with a supply pressure of around 4 kPa transports
the activated liquid at a rate of 150 L/min, from the neutron
generator and bath, through pipes into the BABAR detector,
forces it through thin-walled aluminum tubes in front of the
crystals, and leads it back to the bath in a continuous loop.
Since only a 15 mm gap was available between the inside of the
calorimeter and the next subsystem, the panels sliding into this
gap were allowed to have a thickness of maximal 5 mm. Fig. 5
shows one such panel in production. Round aluminum tubes of
10 mm diameter with 0.5 mm wall thickness were ﬂattened to
a 3 mm height, embedded in polyurethane and covered with
0.4 mm thick aluminum sheets on both sides. Fig. 6 shows
barrel panels at their installation location at the inside of the
calorimeter. The design was different for the endcap, as can be
seen in Fig. 7.

is the bath designed to hold the neutron generator.

missing. One can see the flattened aluminum tubes running up and down
embedded in polyurethane.

C. The Data Acquisition

Photons emitted in the decay of 16N enter the crystals of the
calorimeter at a typical rate of 40 Hz per crystal. According
to Monte Carlo simulations, about 30% of them deposit at
least 3 MeV in an individual crystal. The energies are measured
through the regular data acquisition system, starting with the
detection of the scintillation light by a pair of photo diodes.
The signal from the photo diodes passes through an analog
ampliﬁer mounted at the back of the crystal, then to a 3.7 MHz
digitizer at
the side of the detector. Via optical ﬁber the
signal arrives in Versa Module Europa (VME) crates at readout

modules (ROMs) with embedded processors running VxWorks.
Since the data acquisition system is designed for the triggered
collection of colliding beam events, not for random photons
from the source calibration system, a pulse generator provides
triggers of about 20 kHz to begin the data acquisition sequence.
The ROMs select 128 samples of the wave form that arrives
from each crystal. Since the decay time of CsI(Tl) is quite
long (several hundred nanoseconds) and since the samples are
taken every 270 ns, the signal spreads over several samples of
the wave form. If at least one of these samples is above a
pre-deﬁned threshold of the crystal, the wave form is sent to
a digital ﬁlter. The ﬁlter is based on weights optimized for the
background conditions of the source calibration and is able to
reduce the electronics noise. Then the peak height is determined
with a parabolic ﬁt to the peak of the ﬁltered wave form. If the
peak is still above the threshold of the crystal, its value in
ADC counts is accumulated into an energy spectrum as shown
in Fig. 8. At the end of the source calibration run, each ROM
writes the spectra to a ﬁle.

Since data are taken at a trigger rate of about 20 kHz and
since each wave form has an effective time window of 26 µs, a
live-time of about 50% is reached. Noisy channels can decrease
the performance of the data acquisition, and they are therefore
masked out as well as possible by raising their thresholds for
the data acquisition.

D. Fitting the Energy Spectra

The energy spectra are ﬁtted off-line to three Gaussians
centered around the 6.13 MeV peak and two escape peaks and to
a parameterization of the Compton background and electronics
noise. Other lines from the decay of 16N are negligible at the
present energy resolution. Since the energy of the peaks is
well-known, the ﬁt returns the overall gain (number of ADC
counts per MeV) as well as the resolution, deﬁned here as
the widths of each of the three Gaussian peaks. Since digital

ﬁltering reduces the electronics noise to about 230 keV, an
average energy resolution of about 300 keV is reached (Fig. 9).
This resolution is better than expected from (1) because no
beams are present during the source calibration, the digital ﬁlter
weights are optimized for this no-beam situation, and because
the photons originate right in front of the crystals and reach the
crystals after passing through only a small amount of material.
The systematic error of the measurement is estimated to be not
more than 0.1%.

E. Applying the Constants in Data Analysis

After each calibration run, the calibration constants of each
crystal are recorded into a database. When data collected during
normal e+e− collisions are processed, the energy measured in
each crystal is adjusted via an interpolation between the low-
energy source calibration constants and high-energy calibration
constants from Bhabha events [1].

IV. OPERATIONAL AND SAFETY ISSUES

The liquid source system is able to measure the light yield
to high precision in runs that last 15 to 30 minutes. The runs
are performed every ten days, on average, at times when no e+
or e− beams are present in the collider rings. The aluminum
panels with ﬂattened tubes and liquid add only about 2% in
radiation length to the material in front of the calorimeter
and therefore affect the physics data in only a minimal way.
The system requires nearly no maintenance, and safety hazards
are minimal. The neutron generator is located safely inside a
locked radiation-shielding bunker and only generates neutrons
when its high voltage is turned on. The hazard of FluorinertTM
is negligible, even to the crystals, and the short life-time of the
activated ﬂuid minimizes any radiation exposure in case of an
accidental spill.

since September 1999. The average shift of the crystals is shown for three
different subsets of the crystals. The shaded areas indicate major periods
without beams.

V. RESULTS

Calibration runs started in 1999 when the asymmetric B
Factory began its operation. Fig. 10 illustrates how the average
light yield of the crystals dropped over time for the endcap,
the forward barrel, and the backward barrel. The largest drop
is seen in the forward endcap (∼ 12%), while the smallest drop
is found in the backward barrel (∼ 4%). The shaded areas in
Fig. 10 mark major durations without beams.

Each point in Fig. 10 is an average over crystals from
different manufacturers, located in different places within the
calorimeter, and receiving different radiation doses. To illustrate
the spread of these measurements, Fig. 11 presents the light
yield change from September 1999 to October 2003 versus
the 56 crystal ring. The crystal ring number corresponds to
the order in polar angle as shown in, e.g., Fig. 2. The endcap
ranges from ring 1 to ring 8, which is adjacent to the forward
barrel (rings 9 to 29), followed by the backward barrel (rings
30 to 56). In the average, a larger change is seen toward the
forward end (low crystal ring numbers), and smaller changes
at the backward end, but within each crystal ring the crystals
show quite some spread. The same data are plotted in Fig. 12
with the mean and its error (solid line) and the spread (dotted
line). One clearly sees several rings with larger light yield
changes than their neighbors, like crystal rings 23 to 27 and
ring 52. Since those crystals were obtained from a different
manufacturer than the surrounding crystals, the dependency of
the light yield change on the crystal manufacturer is studied
more below.

Each plot in Fig. 13 shows the distribution of the light
yield change for a certain range of crystal rings for two
manufacturers. Clearly the light yield change is less for the
solid histogram in the left plot (Vendor A) than for the open

Vendor C (open histograms) show even less change than the
crystals from Vendor A. By restricting each plot in Fig. 13 to
few crystal rings, the crystal that are compared are ensured to
have received similar radiation doses.

The radiation received by the calorimeter is also monitored
by 116 special Field Effect Transistors (RadFET) mounted at
the front of the crystals [7]. Although their measurements might
not be completely representative for the dose received by the
crystals because they are based on different physical principles,
important conclusions may still be drawn. The measurements
indicate that the radiation dose inside the barrel is not varying
widely, so that the difference in the light yield changes seen
from the source calibration runs might be mainly due to crystals
originating from different vendors. The radiation dose to the
is larger than to the barrel. The endcap
endcap, however,
is thought to receive additional radiation at the rear of the
crystals from beam background originating from the beam line,
and not only radiation from the front. Similar conclusions
on the radiation dose are also reached from studies of the
change in the leakage current of the crystals’ photo diodes [8].

the source calibration runs. Since RadFET measurements are
available from May 1999 onward, when beams started to pass
through the BABAR detector, the data points in Fig. 14 are
offset horizontally, especially for the endcap. Many factors may
affect the quantities shown in this plot, for example, the beam
conditions that were changing over time, and care must be taken
when interpreting the plot.

At the time of construction, the speciﬁcations for the crystals
required that their light yield response was uniform along the
length of the crystal. But since during operation many more
low-energy photons hit the crystals in the front than in the
rear (especially in the barrel), it
is possible that the front
of the crystals is being damaged more than the rear of the
crystals. So far the drop in light yield appears to be similar
when comparing the results from the low-energy liquid source
calibration and the high-energy Bhabha calibration [8]. Changes
in light yield uniformity are further studied in [9].

VI. CONCLUSION

REFERENCES

Operating with minimal maintenance requirements and min-
imal safety hazards, the liquid source calibration system at
BABAR is frequently measuring the light yield of the crystals
at low energy to the 0.5% accuracy that it was designed for.
By monitoring the light yield changes, the system corrects for
the effects of radiation damage caused to the crystals over
time and allows the resolution of the calorimeter to remain
optimal. The liquid source system therefore serves the need of
the electro-magnetic calorimeter very well.

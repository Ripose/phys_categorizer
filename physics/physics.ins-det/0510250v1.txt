Abstract

The innermost part of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, CERN, will be a pixel detector, which is presently
under construction. The command messages and the readout data of the detector are transmitted over an optical
data path. The readout chain consists of many components which are produced at several locations around the
world, and must work together in the pixel detector. To verify that these parts are working together as expected
a system test has been built up. It consists of detector modules, optoboards, optical ﬁbres, Back of Crate cards,
Readout Drivers, and control computers.

In this paper the system test setup and the operation of the readout chain is described. Also, some results of

tests using the ﬁnal pixel detector readout chain are given.

Key words: ATLAS, Pixel, System Test, Multi-Module, Optical Readout, Optolink

1. The ATLAS Pixel Detector

The ATLAS pixel detector is the innermost de-
tector of the ATLAS experiment [1]. It is com-
prised of 3 barrel layers and 6 disks, with 3 disks
on each side of the primary interaction point. The
three barrel shells are referred as B-Layer, Layer
1, Layer 2, from inside to outside. The shells are
equipped with staves, each of which hold 13 mod-
ules glued on a carbon-carbon structure. The disks
are built up of sectors which hold 6 modules on a
carbon-carbon structure. Each disk has 8 sectors.

(Tobias Flick).

In total there will be 1744 modules having 46080
channels each. Every module is connected by a ca-
ble and a patch panel to an optoboard, which is
then connected optically to the readout electron-
ics.

2. The Readout Chain

The readout chain for the ATLAS pixel detector
consists of an on-detector part and an oﬀ-detector
part. The oﬀ-detector components,
located in
the counting room, are the Back of Crate cards
(BOC), the Readout Drivers (ROD), the Timing
and Interface Modules (TIM), and the Readout
Buﬀers (ROB). The TIM receives the ATLAS

clock and distributes it to the detector parts. The
RoBs are storing the data. These last two devices
are not part of the system test.

The on-detector components are the modules
and the optoboards. The modules are connected
by aluminium cables to patch panels on which
the optoboards are placed. Either 6 or 7 mod-
ules share one optoboard. The optoboards are
connected with optical ﬁbres to the oﬀ-detector
electronics. A scheme of the system test setup is
given in Figure 1.

2.1. Readout Driver (ROD)

In the counting room there are RODs 1 placed in
9U VME crates. The ROD is foreseen to perform
the data formatting and the building of event frag-
ments. Additionally, it has capabilities to monitor
the data taken. The card is controlled by a Single
Board Computer (SBC) placed in the same crate
and acting as a Readout Crate Controller (RCC).
For further information, please refer to [3].

1 The Readout Driver has been developed by the Lawrence
Berkeley National Lab and the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, USA.

2.2. Back of Crate Card (BOC card)

The Back of Crate card 2 is placed back-to-back
with the ROD. It is also a 9U VME-card and
serves as the optical interface between the ROD
and the optoboards. It has functionalities for data
recovery, stream demultiplexing, and timing ad-
justment. Four transmission (TX) plug-ins and
four receiver (RX) plug-ins can be mounted on the
BOC card.

2.3. Opto plug-ins

On the pixel BOC card, there will be opto plug-
ins 3 to send/receive the data to/from the mod-
ules. The transmitting device is the TX plug-in. It
contains a Bi-Phase-Mark (BPM) chip to decode
the clock and the commands for the modules to
one single stream per module, and sends it opti-
cally via Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers
(VCSEL) to the detector.

2 The Back of Crate card has been developed by Cavensich
Laboratory, Cambridge, UK. Wuppertal University, Ger-
many, has adopted it to the pixel system and is organising
the production.
3 The plug-ins have been developed by Academica Sinica,
Taiwan.

Each of these devices has 8 channels, of which 6

or 7 will be used (see also [4]).

2.4. Optoboard and Optical Fibres

Two types of ﬁbres will be used for the ATLAS
pixel detector. There are radiation hard SIMM-
ﬁbres in the inner region of the ATLAS detector
connected to less radiation tolerant GRIN-ﬁbres in
the outer region. The ﬁbres will be installed as ca-
bles containing 8 ribbons with 8 ﬁbres per ribbon.
The distance between the optoboards and the opto
plug-ins will be ∼ 80 m.

Fig. 4. Optoboard, on the top side there are two VCSEL
arrays with housings and driver chips (right side) and pas-
sive components. The optoboard measures 2 cm x 6 cm

The optoboard 5 (see Figure 4) is the electrical-
optical converter on the on-detector side. It re-
ceives the optical BPM-signal for the modules and
converts it to two electrical signals, these being the
clock and data lines.
In the opposite direction, the optoboard converts
the electrical data signals from the modules into
optical signals and then sends them to the RX plug-
in mounted on the BOC card. Each optoboard can
handle 7 modules. A detailed description is given
in [5].

The data from the modules are received by RX
plug-ins. They contain a PiN 4 -diode and an ampli-

To test the quality of the optical data transmis-
sion system, a bit error rate measurement was per-
formed. The link from the optoboard to the Back

is a P-doped layer, an intrinsic conducting part, and an
N-doped layer.

Ohio State University, USA and Siegen University, Ger-
many.

4. System Test

4.1. Setup

The system test setup has been assembled to
readout two staves, mounted together as a bi-stave.
The bi-stave is mounted into a climate chamber
to ensure operation under controlled temperature
and humidity. The modules of each half stave are
connected to a separate patch panel equipped with
an optoboard. The power cables, which also con-
nect to the patch panel, are very similar in terms
of length and material to those which will be used
in the experiment. This setup is used to study the
behaviour of the modules on stave, the readout
scheme, and the interaction of both. Of special in-
terest for this paper is if there is any diﬀerence of
the module behaviour due to the optical readout.
The powering as well as the monitoring of volt-
ages, currents, and temperatures are performed by
the Detector Control System (DCS) (see also [6]).
The system test DCS employs ﬁnal prototypes.
The interplay of the DCS and the readout system
is studied as well.

4.2. Test Results

Several tests are necessary to check the module
functionality. There are separate tests for the dig-
ital and for the analog part of the electronics.

From the analog scan (see Figures 6(a) - 6(b))
one can derive the threshold and the noise of a
module, which can then be compared to former
measurements. More information about the mo-
dule tests are given in [2].

The measurements performed in the system test
with one half of a stave (6 modules) have been com-
pared to those performed for the modules individ-
ually during production:
– Using electrical readout only, the performance
of the modules has been tested after module as-
sembly (before glueing) and after full stave as-
sembly (after glueing).

– Using optical readout, tests have been done at
stave level on a module-by-module mode (stave
separate). The modules have been powered sep-
arately and they have been read out separately.

of Crate card was used to test the transmission. A
test pattern from a Bit Error Rate Tester has been
given to the optoboard electrically. This has then
been transmitted over the optical link. The pat-
tern received by the BOC card has been compared
with the original one.

Two diﬀerent bandwidths have been studied:
40 Mb/s and 80 Mb/s, as will be used in the AT-
LAS detector. The test has shown a successful op-
eration of the optical link with a good transmission
quality. We measured no errors in the transmis-
sions. Therefore only a limit for the bit error rate
can be calculated. In the standard way one gets
this out of equation 1 assuming one error. The cal-
culated limits for the bit error rate are 6.32 · 10−15
for the 40 Mb/s and 1.57 · 10−14 for the 80 Mb/s
bandwidth. The results are listed in Table 1.

dispersion of 60 electrons are well in the speciﬁcations. (b) Noise distribution histogram for a typical noise scan. The mean
noise of 150 electrons with a spread of 10 electrons is very good. The small dispersion indicates a uniform distribution over
the whole module.

– Using optical readout, tests with all modules
together have been done at stave level as well
(stave all). All the modules have been powered
and were read out in parallel.

The results are shown in the plots given in Figures
7, 8, and 9. Small diﬀerences have been observed
which can be attributed to temperature dependen-
cies of the measurements. The electrical readout
has been tested at 25◦ C and 27◦ C while the opti-
cal readout was performed at 18◦ C and 19◦ C.

The threshold is tuned for a certain tempera-
ture. It rises with the operating temperature of the
module. The dispersion of the threshold increases
with the diﬀerence between tuning temperature
and operating temperature. Finally, a lower oper-
ation temperature decreases the noise of the mo-
dule.

5. Summary

We built up a system test in Wuppertal to study
the behaviour of a multi-module system in terms of
powering, module behaviour, and readout. Special
attention has been given to the optical data trans-
mission on the readout chain and its inﬂuence on
the module behaviour.

The results of the tests performed with the sys-
tem test setup, including the optical readout, are
in good agreement with those of previous ones.
The modules behave as expected. One observes
lower thresholds at lower temperatures. This ef-
fect is seen in the separate and common powering
schemes. The dispersion is also changing with the
change of thresholds. This one can be seen from
Figure 8.

The noise of the modules increases with the
operation temperature. This eﬀect can be seen
in the diﬀerent measurements. While the noise is
around 170 electrons for the warmer environment
(∼ 25◦C) it is around 160 electrons for the colder
one (∼ 19◦C).

The behavior of the complete system has been
studied. The transmission quality has been found
to be good. The readout of a single module or of
multiple modules is working as expected with the
optical transmission system. There is no indication
of degradation.

After showing that the small system is working
stably, the system test will be scaled to a larger
readout modularity.

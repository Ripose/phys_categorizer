Abstract— The performance of Gas Electron Multipliers
(GEMs) in gaseous He, Ne, He+H2 and Ne+H2 was studied
at temperatures in the range of 3-293 K. This paper reports
on previously published measurements and additional studies
on the effects of the purity of the gases in which the GEM
performance is evaluated. In He, at temperatures between 77
and 293 K, triple-GEM structures operate at rather high gains,
exceeding 1000. There is an indication that this high gain is
achieved through the Penning effect as a result of impurities in
the gas. At lower temperatures the gain-voltage characteristics
are signiﬁcantly modiﬁed probably due to the freeze-out of these
impurities. Double-GEM and single-GEM structures can operate
down to 3 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas density of
about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities the maximum gain drops further.
In Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures.
The gain drop in Ne at low temperatures can be re-established in
Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very high gains, exceeding 104, have
been obtained in these mixtures at 30-77 K, at a density of 9.2 g/l
which corresponds to saturated Ne vapor density at 27 K. The
addition of small amounts of H2 in He also re-establishes large
GEM gains above 30 K but no gain was observed in He+H2 at
4 K and a density of 1.7 g/l (corresponding to roughly one-tenth
of the saturated vapor density). These studies are, in part, being
pursued in the development of two-phase He and Ne detectors
for solar neutrino detection.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE motivation for studying the performance of Gas

Electron Multipliers (GEMs) at cryogenic temperatures
stems from the eBubble project [1], which aims to develop
a low energy solar neutrino detector. The eBubble detector
is currently envisioned as a two-phase detector which should
operate in those liquids which allow the formation of electron
bubbles [2].

The eBubble detector is a Time Projection Chamber-like
(TPC) tracking detector. The expected signal from low energy
solar neutrino interactions comes the measurement of ioniza-
tion of elastically scattered target electrons. The ionization sig-
nals are expected to be small and hence the signal needs to be
ampliﬁed in the saturated vapor above the liquid phase. GEMs
can operate in noble gases at high gain [3] and cryogenic
temperature [4] and therefore are naturally of interest. Other
applications for this detector include but are not limited to
WIMP detection [5] and Positron Emission Tomography [6].

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup used in these studies was developed
at Columbia University Nevis Laboratories and at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. Figure 1 illustrates the basic components
of the setup. Three GEM foils and a photocathode were
mounted in the tracking chamber. The chamber was connected
to a support tube which was in direct contact with a cryogenic
liquid reservoir. This tube also served as one port through
which the gas could be ﬁlled into the chamber. A second
method of ﬁlling the chamber was used which sealed the
central line and rather ﬁlled through a tube which passed
through the vacuum region isolated from the reservoir.

The eBubble chamber is a double walled vessel. Two
copper cooling loops for the cryogen vapor-cooling circuits
are soldered on the ﬂanges of the chamber. A needle valve in
the cryostat is used to supply and control the ﬂow rate from the
reservoir to the cooling circuits. Measurements at temperatures
between 77-293 K were performed by ﬁlling the reservoir with
liquid nitrogen and measurements at temperatures down to 2 K
were performed with liquid helium in the reservoir.

The chamber was initially ﬁlled with He, Ne and/or H2
taken directly from gas bottles with 99.999% quoted purities.
The data from this gas supply will be henceforth referred to as
“pure” gas. The gas could also be puriﬁed further by passing
the gas through an Oxisorb1 ﬁlter followed by a getter. The
additional puriﬁcation system2 is presumed to reduce the level
of impurities to 1 ppb. Data from this further puriﬁed gas will
be henceforth referred to as “ultrapure” for clarity.

The photocathode was composed of a semitransparent gold
ﬁlm deposited on a quartz substrate. A UV window at the
bottom allowed the transmission of light from a high-powered
Xe ﬂash lamp to the the photocathode.

The GEMs were produced at CERN and had the following
parameters: 50 µm thick kapton, 70 and 55 µm hole diameter
on the copper and kapton respectively, and a 140 µm hole
pitch. The active area of the GEMs was 28×28 mm2. The
GEM foils were mounted on G10 frames with an inter-GEM
separation of 2 mm. The distance between the photocathode
and the ﬁrst GEM was 10 mm.

The GEM electrodes were biased through a resistive high
voltage divider placed outside the cryostat. It was comprised
of three identical circuits connected in parallel and ensured
an equal voltage drop across the GEMs and the gaps between
them.

The “calibration” signal was induced by electrons arriving at
the ﬁrst electrode of the ﬁrst GEM from the photocathode, i.e.
before avalanche ampliﬁcation. Both avalanche and calibration
signals were read out using a charge-sensitive preampliﬁer
followed by a linear ampliﬁer. The gain is deﬁned as the pulse-
height of the avalanche signal at the last GEM divided by that
of the calibration signal, at a shaping time of 10 µs. The drift
ﬁeld was ∼ 1 kV/cm.

III. FIRST MEASUREMENTS OF GEM GAIN AT LOW
TEMPERATURES

Initial measurements were performed and published [7] in
the setup described in section II. The measurements in [7] were
made with gas directly taken from gas bottles with 99.999%
quoted purity and ﬁlled through the central tube.

The performance of GEMs in gaseous He, Ne and mixtures
of Ne and H2 was studied in the temperature range of 2.6-
293 K. Above 77 K in He, the triple-GEM structures can
operate at high gains exceeding 1000. The transition from LN2
to LHe temperatures is characterized by an increase in the
operating voltage and a dramatic decrease of the maximum
gain. Double and single-GEM structures functioned at 2.6 K
and a density of 0.5 g/l at a gain of order 10. At higher
densities the gain drops further. At a density of 1.6 g/l at
2.6K, the maximum gain observed in the double-GEM is
about 5. This corresponds to a gas density about an order of
magnitude less than saturated vapor density at 4.2K. At lower
temperatures the slope of the gain-voltage curve also decreased
which indicated a change in the avalanche mechanism.

2The additional puriﬁcation system consisted of a SAES MonoTorr heated
rare gas puriﬁer. An input ﬂow rate of 5 slpm was used which reduced the
inlet N2 impurity level to less than 1 ppb. For further purity performance spec-
iﬁcations see http://www.puregastechnologies.com/ps4.htm.

In Ne a similar effect was observed. However, in Ne the
drop in gain could be compensated for and even enhanced by
the addition of a small fraction, ∼ 0.1% of H2. Very high
gains, 104, were obtained at 55 K and a density of 9.2 g/l
which corresponds to the saturated vapor density of Ne at
27 K.

One possible explanation for the observed suppression of
the GEM gain at low temperatures was the likelihood that
the gain above 77 K was a result of Penning ionization of
impurities which freeze out as the temperature is lowered to
order of 4 K.

IV. GEM PERFORMANCE IN HELIUM

In order to test the impurity hypothesis, subsequent runs
were performed with additional puriﬁcation of the gas source
as described in section II. Figure 2 shows the gain-voltage
characteristics for a double-GEM structure at 77 K and a
density of 0.55 g/l. There is a clear suppression of the gain
in the ultrapure He as compared to the previous data taken
with pure gas directly from the gas bottle. Also shown is the
effect of the addition of 0.1% of H2 which not only restores
the large gain but enhances it further.

As the temperature is decreased to liquid helium tempera-
tures the high gain attained at 77 K in the He+H2 mixture is
lost. This is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the single-GEM
performance at a density of 1.7 g/l. The increased density and
the decreased effect of other mechanisms, such as associative
ionization which is presumed to decrease with temperature [7],
could both contribute to the loss in gain. However, at 4.4 K
the H2 vapor pressure is negligible and hence any enhanced
gain from Penning ionization is lost at low temperatures.

V. GEM PERFORMANCE IN NEON

The effect of purifying the source Ne gas on the GEM
gain is the same as in the case with He. Figure 4 shows a
comparison between pure and ultrapure Ne gas data. As in
the case between pure and ultrapure He, the ultrapure Ne gas
shows much lower gain, in a triple-GEM, than the pure Ne

gas above 77 K. In addition, there is a further reduction in
the signal between the 77 K and 30 K data which is not
understood.

At low temperatures the problem of the gain drop is solved
by the addition of a small amount of H2. Very high gains, 104,
are observed (see Fig. 5) at 30 K and a density of 9.2 g/l, which
corresponds to the saturated Ne vapor density at 27 K. The
gas mixture for all the data shown in Fig. 5 was ﬁlled into the
chamber at 77 K and kept for all the measurements. Gain
curve increases with decreasing temperature. One possible
explanation for this is that the Ne vapor pressure is falling
faster than that of the H2 resulting in a different concentration
of H2 at the various temperature points. Another and more
likely explanation is that there is a change in the concentration
of H2 as a result of stratiﬁcation that can occur due to the
temperature gradient in the ﬁlling tube.

Nonetheless, the observation of high gain in a triple-GEM
at saturated density makes the Ne+H2 mixture a viable option
for the eBubble two-phase detector.

VI. DISCUSSION

The aim of these studies was to investigate the performance
of GEMs in ultrapure He and Ne gases at low temperatures
and high densities. These are the conditions required by an
application to detect low energy solar neutrinos [1].

Previously published measurements had shown high gains
in GEMs operated in He above 62 K [7], which decreased as
the temperature was lowered. Further measurements, presented
in Fig. 2, show that with further puriﬁcation of the He a
signiﬁcant reduction in the gain at 77 K occurs. This conﬁrms
the conclusion in [7] that the gain observed above 62 K is due
to Penning ionization of impurities in the He. The addition of a
controlled impurity, namely H2, restored and further enhanced
the gain at 77 K and ρ = 0.55 g/l above the aforementioned
measurements.

Figure 3 further supported the supposition that the gain
at high temperatures was a result of Penning ionization on
impurities. At 4 K in a He+H2 mixture, there was no gain since
the vapor pressure of the H2 is neglibile at this temperature.
Some is observed at 54 K, where the H2 impurity affects the
avalanche gain.

At 30 K and a density ρ = 9.2 g/l, gains of order 104
were achieved in an ultrapure Ne+H2 mixture. Higher gains
were observed (see Fig. 5) in the same gas mixture with
decreasing temperature. This was most likely due to a change
in the H2 fraction in the mixture. The H2 concentration can
change as a result of stratiﬁcation that can occur due to the
temperature gradient in the ﬁlling tube, or because the relative
vapor pressure of Ne was falling faster than that of the H2 at
lower temperatures.

The measurements presented in this paper indicate that
impurities play a signiﬁcant role in GEM gains in He and Ne at
temperatures above 30 K. This conclusion is supported further
by Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 which show the ionization coefﬁcients es-
timated from these measurements according to the prescription
in [8]. Figure 6 shows that the ionization coefﬁcients derived
from the ultrapure He data lie close to the measurements taken
from literature, where the primary mechanism for avalanche

vapor density at 27 K. This makes the use of GEMs as a
method of ampliﬁcation of low-energy solar neutrino signals
in liquid neon an attractive and viable option for the eBubble
detector.

VII. CONCLUSION

The effect of gas purity on the performance of GEMs in He
and Ne was studied at low temperatures. When the gas supply
was taken directly from gas bottles with 99.999% quoted
purities, large gains were observed above 77 K. The gain drops
signiﬁcantly at lower temperatures which is predominantly due
to the freezing out of impurities and hence the suppression of
Penning ionization of impurities. The gain was observed to
decrease dramatically even at high temperatures after further
puriﬁcation of the gas supply, by additional ﬁltering through
Oxisorb and a getter.

High gains were restored for Ne through the addition of a
small amount of H2. This gain persisted at levels on the order
of 104 at 30 K and a density which corresponds to saturated

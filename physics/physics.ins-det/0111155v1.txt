CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN FOR THE LIGO PRE-STABILIZED LASER

Abstract

To meet the strain sensitivity requirements [1], [2] of
the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory
(LIGO), the laser frequency and amplitude noise must ini-
tially be reduced by a factor of 1000 in the pre-stabilized
portion of the interferometer [3]. A control system was
implemented to provide laser noise suppression, data ac-
quisition interfaces, diagnostics, and operator control in-
puts. This paper describes the VME-based analog and dig-
ital controls used in the LIGO Pre-stabilized Laser (PSL).

INTRODUCTION

Gravitational waves, the ripples in the fabric of space-time,
were predicted by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
Although astronomical observations have inferred the ex-
istence of gravitational waves, they have yet to be detected
directly. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Ob-
servatory (LIGO) is one of the large-scale gravitational-
wave detectors currently being built worldwide.

The Pre-stabilized Laser (PSL) subsystem is the light
source for the LIGO detector as shown in Figure 1. The
output of the PSL is modematched into the suspended mod-
ecleaner before being coupled into the LIGO interferome-
ter. The term pre-stabilized is used because the laser under-
goes two stages of stabilization prior to being injected into
the interferometer.

The 10-W laser used is conﬁgured as a master-
oscillator-power-ampliﬁer (MOPA), with a 700 mW single-
frequency, single-mode non-planar ring oscillator used as
the master oscillator. The control strategy uses the actu-
ators of the master oscillator in order to stabilize the fre-
quency. Power stabilization is achieved by control of the
power ampliﬁer output.

NOISE SUPPRESSION

The PSL topology is shown in Figure 2. Light from the
laser is modematched into a high-throughput, ring Fabry-
Perot cavity called the pre-modecleaner (PMC). The PSL
has a design requirement that the output be close to the
shot-noise limit for 600 mW of detected light at the interfer-
ometer modulation frequency of 25 MHz. As this is beyond
the bandwidth of any electronics servo, it is done by pas-
sive ﬁltering by the PMC. By appropriate choice of mirror

reﬂectivity, the PMC acts as a tracking bandpass ﬁlter with
a pole at the cavity half-bandwidth. One of the PMC mir-
rors is epoxied to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) to vary
the length of the cavity. The servo electronics constantly
adjusts the PZT voltage in order to keep the incident light
resonant with the cavity.

3 FREQUENCY STABILIZATION

Astrophysical models suggest that in order to plausibly de-
tect candidate gravitational-wave sources, the LIGO detec-
tor must achieve a displacement sensitivity of better than
10−19 m/√Hz at 100 Hz. This corresponds to a frequency
noise of 10−7 Hz/√Hz at 100 Hz.

3.1 Actuators

The frequency stabilization servo utilizes three frequency
actuators inside the 10-W laser. A thermo-electric cooler
(TEC) bonded to the laser gain medium actuates on the
laser frequency by thermally changing the optical path
length. DC–1 Hz adjustments to the laser frequency are
made with the TEC. This actuator, modeled as three poles
at 0.1 Hz, has a coefﬁcient of 4 GHz / V and is used for large
scale adjustments to the laser frequency. Also bonded to
the laser gain medium is a PZT, which covers DC–10 kHz.
A voltage applied to the PZT stresses the laser medium and
induces refractive index changes to change the laser fre-
quency. The PZT has a ﬂat response to
100 kHz and is
known to have a number of mechanical resonances beyond
100 kHz. Fast frequency ﬂuctuations beyond 10 kHz are
handled by the third frequency actuator, a Pockels cell lo-
cated between the master oscillator and power ampliﬁer.

Implementation

A small fraction of the output of the PMC is sampled and
frequency shifted through an 80 MHz acousto-optic mod-
ulator (AOM). The output of the AOM is focussed into
a phase modulator that imparts sidebands at 21.5 MHz.
The output of the phase modulator is then modematched
into a high-ﬁnesse,
linear Fabry-Perot cavity which is
used as a frequency reference against which the laser fre-
quency is stabilized. The frequency stabilization scheme
employs the well-known Pound-Drever-Hall technique in
which the light incident on the reference cavity is phase-
modulated [4]. Both the carrier and sideband light reﬂected
from the reference cavity is focused onto a tuned photode-
tector. The output of the tuned photodetector is bandpass
ﬁltered and synchronously demodulated to derive the error
signal.

In order to ensure closed-loop stability, the open-loop
gain of the PZT actuator must be well below that of the
Pockels cell at the PZT mechanical resonance frequency.
To ensure this, the PZT actuator path is aggressively rolled

of the Pockels cell, the PZT path is naturally unstable at
15 kHz. With a dynamic range some 30 times greater
∼
than that of the Pockels cell, a self-sustaining oscillation
may arise if saturation occurs in the Pockels cell path. Lim-
iting the dynamic range of the PZT actuator prevents this
instability.

INTENSITY STABILIZATION

Photons in the laser light induce a source of noise in the in-
terferometer known as radiation pressure noise. This noise
arises from the momentum imparted to the mirrors as statis-
tically different numbers of photons reﬂect off the mirrors
in the interferometer. To minimize the movement of the in-
terferometer mirrors due to radiation pressure, the intensity
ﬂuctuations of the laser must be stabilized to the level of

10−8 1 / √Hz.

4.1 Actuator

Currently in the prototype design phase, the intensity servo
utilizes a current shunt for fast regulation of the power
ampliﬁer pump diode current. Placed in parallel with the
power ampliﬁer pump diodes, the current shunt was de-
signed to carry

250 mA.

Implementation

The intensity stabilization servo adopts a dual-loop topol-
ogy as illustrated in Figure 3.
Inputs from photodetec-
tors located after the PMC and modecleaner are used in
either a single or dual sensor conﬁguration. In the single
sensor conﬁguration, the outer-loop photodetector provides
the signal to the servo electronics. In the case where the
modecleaner is not locked, the single-sensor signal comes
from the inner loop photodetector. In the dual sensor case,
both the inner and outer feedback paths provide signals to
the servo electronics.

In the dual loop conﬁguration, noise suppression is es-
tablished in two phases. Closing the inner loop yields a
high-bandwidth, well-behaved inner loop with partial noise
suppression. The outer loop is then closed around the inner
loop to provide the balance of the noise suppression.

5 DATA ACQUISITION AND USER

CONTROL

The user control and interface is via the Experimental
Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). Through
EPICS the operator can remotely monitor the performance
of the PSL and adjust the various servo loop gains and
settings. The operator interface is a series of graphical
screens, that indicate the current status of the PSL. Process-
ing the data and events is the input / output controller (IOC),
a Baja4700E MIPS-based processor running the vxWorks
kernel. The IOC performs the real-world input/output tasks
and local control tasks, and provides status information
through the Channel Access network protocol.

The control software for the PSL is event-driven and
is written in state notation language. Although not fully
debugged, automated operation from cold start through to
full operation has been demonstrated. One software rou-
tine constantly adjusts the TEC on the 10-W laser to keep
the laser frequency well within the dynamic range of the

PZT. One consequence of this is that lock re-acquisition is
instantaneous once the cause of the loss of lock is removed.
At present a dozen signals are acquired and logged
through the LIGO data acquisition system. Fast signals are
acquired at the rate of 16 kHz whilst slower signals are ac-
quired at 256 Hz. All signals are recorded and logged.

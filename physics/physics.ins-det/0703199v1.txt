Abstract

The electromagnetic calorimeter of PANDA at the FAIR facility will rely on an
operation of lead tungstate (PWO) scintillation crystals at temperatures near -25 ◦C
to provide suﬃcient resolution for photons in the energy range from 8 GeV down to
10 MeV. Radiation hardness of PWO crystals was studied at the IHEP (Protvino)
irradiation facility in the temperature range from room temperature down to -25 ◦C.
These studies have indicated a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent behaviour in the time evolution
of the damaging processes well below room temperature. Diﬀerent signal loss levels
at the same dose rate, but at diﬀerent temperatures were observed. The eﬀect of
a deep suppression of the crystal recovery process at temperatures below 0 ◦C has
been seen.

1 Introduction

Total absorption shower counters made of lead tungstate (P bW O4 or PWO) scintillation
crystals are very promising for development of high quality electromagnetic calorimeters[1].
They have already been used in the PRIMEX experiment at JLaB and manifested a
brilliant π0-mass resolution (1.5MeV /c2) [2]. The CMS electromagnetic calorimeter con-
sisting of 62,000 PWO crystals in the barrel part and 15,000 in the endcap part is due

to start operation at LHC soon [3]. Both the calorimeters work at room temperature.
ALICE, another calorimeter at LHC, will be the ﬁrst PWO-based calorimeter in the
world operating at a temperature decreased down to -25 ◦C. An increase of the light
yield by a factor of 3 in comparison with operation at room temperature (+20 ◦C) is
expected [4]. Moreover, the noise of the calorimeter electronics will be reduced. Both
these eﬀects will improve the energy resolution of the calorimeter. The same operation
temperature of -25 ◦C is selected also for 20,000 PWO crystals in the PANDA calorimeter,
a new experiment in the FAIR project at GSI, Germany [5] . Radiation hardness is another
important issue in application of PWO scintillators in high energy physics experiments.
It is well known that crystal scintillators suﬀer from radiation damage. This problem
has been extensively studied over the last seven years at CMS [6,7] and BTeV, the
Fermilab experiment which was terminated in 2005 [8,9,10]. However, all the studies of
PWO radiation hardness have been carried out only at room temperature.

In this paper we present the results of the ﬁrst investigation of PWO crystal radiation
hardness at temperatures below 0 ◦C. The temperature was varied in the range from
+20 ◦C down to -25 ◦C. The study was carried out for two diﬀerent radiation loads of
20 and 2 rad/h (radiation loads for the PANDA endcap electromagnetic calorimeter are
estimated to be up to 2-3 rad/h).

We used eight crystals produced by the ”North Crystals” Company in Apatity (denoted
by the letter “a” in this paper) and two more crystals produced by the Bogoroditsk
Techno-Chemical Plant (“b”). The crystals which are marked as “b”, as well as a1412
and a1434 were produced at the end of 2002. The other crystals were produced in 2005.
The dimensions of the crystals were ∼ 22 × 22 mm2 in cross section and 180 mm in

provided in Table 1. The data show that these samples are typical examples of PWO
scintillation crystals with similar transmittance and light yield however they diﬀer by the
doped elements and the growth number (number of a crystal growing in the same crucible
without cleaning of it).

2 Experimental procedure

A radioactive source 137Cs emitting 661 KeV photons and having activity of 5 · 1012 Bq
was used to irradiate the crystals. Five crystals were irradiated simultaneously during each
exposition. A commercial dosimeter, DKS-AT1123, was used to measure the dose rate (in
air) in proximity to the crystals. The accuracy is better than 20% [12]. The simulated
transverse radiation dose rate proﬁle in crystal is shown in Fig. 1 [13].

Layout of the gamma irradiation setup is depicted in Fig. 2. Cryothermostat LAUDA
RC6CP was exploited to stabilize and control the temperature of the crystal set under
irradiation. Cooling power of 300W provided by this cryothermostat was suﬃcient to
maintain the constant temperature for a long time with the absolute accuracy of 0.1 ◦C.
Glycol aqueous solution circulating between the LAUDA bath and the heat exchanger
plate, where the crystals were installed, was used to maintain the crystals at a required
temperature. The bases of the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), which were installed outside
the heat exchanger, were the main heat sources inside the crystal compartment. To make
the temperature distribution more uniform, a permanent gas ﬂow inside the compartment
was provided using a fan. Dry nitrogen gas was supplied to the compartment to avoid
problems with moisture gathering. To monitor the temperature of the crystals, several
thermosensors (type PT100 and PT1000) were installed on the heat exchanger plate and
directly on the crystals. To monitor variation of the light transmittance of the crystals due
to irradiation as well as possible PMT gain instabilities, we used an LED-based monitoring

system. This system enabled us to investigate the radiation-induced absorption of the
crystals in two diﬀerent spectral regions, in the vicinity of 450 nm and 640 nm. The
system consisted of two similar modules. Each module contained blue or red LEDs with
individual drivers, light mixer, one photodiode and ﬁber bundle. The system was similar
to that described in more detail in [11].

A direct current (DC) method was used to test the radiation hardness of the crystals.
The mean current value of the PMT through a 10 kOhm resistor was measured by sigma-
delta ADC. This signal was proportional to the luminescence intensity and, consequently,
to the light output of the crystal. The change of this signal provided an information on
the changes in the light output invoked by irradiation. Simultaneously, the LED based
monitoring system provided information on variation in crystal light transmittance. Since
the level of the DC signal was low (a few microamps), sensitive measurement devices were
installed in a close proximity to the photodetectors. Digitized signals were transferred
further to a remote computer using the RS485 protocol.

Ten crystals (two groups, ﬁve crystals in each group) were irradiated at the dose rate
of 20 rad/h (and 2 rad/h) at diﬀerent temperatures. Each cycle lasted from 50 to 300
hours. Before each cycle, the crystals were exposed to the daylight at room temperature
to recover after the previous cycle of irradiation. The recovery was tested by a reference
measurement of the light output at +20◦C. We observed that the crystals restore their
initial light output within 5% after four days of such recovery.

3 Results

As it might be expected, cooling of the scintillation crystals increases their light output.
Decrease of temperature from +20 ◦C down to -20 ◦C resulted in an increase in the PMT
signal corresponding to the light output by approximately a factor of 3. The distribution
of this enhancement factor for all 10 samples under study is presented in Fig. 3. The PMT
current as a function of temperature for ﬁve crystals from one group is presented in Fig. 4.
Four cycles of measurements at four diﬀerent temperatures, +20 ◦C, +5 ◦C, -10 ◦C, and
-22 ◦C, were performed. The curves in Fig. 4 are just a guide for the eye. Before the
irradiation, the light output at diﬀerent temperatures of all ﬁve samples was the same
within the experimental error. After the irradiation, the temperature dependence of the
light output became less pronounced. The trend of this dependence was the same for

all crystals, but the diﬀerences in absolute values were much higher than those before
irradiation. As the radiation hardness of the crystals is slightly diﬀerent, they loose
diﬀerent portions of their initial light output after the same period of irradiation at the
same dose rate.

To test the time evolution of the variation of the light output, we measured the PMT DC
current as a function of time when the crystals were subjected to persistent irradiation
at a constant dose rate. Typical curves of light output change under irradiation at the
dose rate of 30 rad/h are shown in Fig. 5. Initially, +20 ◦C temperature was maintained.
The signal dropped within the ﬁrst 20 hours and approached practically a constant level
afterwards. The drop was diﬀerent for diﬀerent crystals. As discussed above, decrease of
temperature down to -23 ◦C caused an increase of the signal by a factor of approximately
3. The further irradiation caused a decrease of the signal. The signal also tends to a
constant value. However, the time necessary to reach the constant value is longer, more
than 300 hours, instead of 30 h at +20 ◦C. The next set of measurements was performed
at the dose rate of 2 rad/h, which is about the maximal dose rate expected for the crystals
in calorimeter for PANDA experiment. The same groups of the crystals were irradiated
at +20 ◦C and -20 ◦C. Fig. 6 shows that after initial drop the signal in all expositions
tends to reach a constant value. The higher is the dose rate, the lower is the constant
level and the faster this constant level is reached. As demonstrated also in Fig. 6, decrease
of temperature enhances the initial signal drop and delays the process of approaching a
constant light output level.

We also observed striking diﬀerences in recovery of the initial optical transmittance at the
room and low temperatures. Almost no recovery is observed at -25 ◦C (see the ﬁrst time
period indicated in Fig. 7). Meanwhile, when the temperature is ﬁxed at +20 ◦C, we can
see a noticeable growth of the crystal transmittance (the second time period in Fig. 7).

The results of irradiation over 80 hours of the ten crystals at 2 and 20 rad/h dose rate
for the two temperatures, +20 ◦C and -20 ◦C, are collected in the Table 2. We have not
seen any signiﬁcant diﬀerence in radiation hardness of the ten crystals dependent on the
doped element (see Tables 1 and 2) neither on the manufacturer. Though we might notice
that crystal a15608 is the most radiation hard.

4 Discussion

It is most probable that the increase of light output at low temperatures is caused
by decreased loss of excitation via non-radiative recombination. Meanwhile, the lower
radiation hardness and suppressed recovery after irradiation, which were observed at
low temperatures, are of considerable importance in application of PWO scintillation
crystals as scintillators in cooled detectors. As it is generally accepted, the changes of
light output of PWO crystals subjected to irradiation are caused not by any variations
in emission eﬃciency but rather by radiation-induced absorption. Peculiarities of these
features of radiation hardness will be studied in more detail in further publications. There
are currently two approaches explaining the optical properties of PWO crystal under
irradiation [6,14,15].

According to one approach [6], transmission damage occurs in crystal when valence
electrons are trapped in metastable states around the crystal defects. The irradiation
of the crystals creates color centers which absorb light in particular spectral regions and
cause reabsorption of the PWO emission. When the rate of color centers production
(proportional to the irradiation dose rate) equals the natural temperature-dependent
recovery rate, the crystal light output reaches a saturation level (quasi-plateau). Thus,
the temperature dependent features of irradiation-induced absorption and recovery of the
initial transmittance after termination of the irradiation can be interpreted by the shift
of the balance between production and recovery of the color centers.

According to another approach [14,15], the results presented above are in agreement
with interpretation of radiation-induced changes in light output by structural changes
in inclusions of variable-valency tungstate oxides W O3−x [15]. Since tungsten has variable
valency, irradiation invokes changes in tungsten valency, rearrangement of oxygen ions
in the clusters W O3−x, and, consequently, in change of absorption by these clusters. The
irradiation-induced changes in the structure of W O3−x clusters proceed slower at decreased
temperatures, and the thermal energy is insuﬃcient to facilitate the rearrangement of the
initial cluster structure, which is necessary for recovery of initial optical transmittance.

5 Summary

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study of radiation hardness of PWO
scintillation crystals at temperatures decreased below the room temperature. Using a
selection of 10 similar commercial PWO crystals produced by diﬀerent manufactures we
demonstrate that the radiation-induced decrease of light output proceeds slower at lower
temperatures and the initial output does not recover after termination of irradiation when
the crystal temperature is maintained at -25 ◦C. Nevertheless, the constant value of light
output, which is reached after certain time under crystal irradiation at -25 ◦C, is still
considerable higher than that at the room temperature. Thus, cooling of PWO detectors
is beneﬁcial, though the long time evolution of the light output of the crystal under
irradiation at decreased temperature (of the order of hundreds hours) should be taken
into account in application of these detectors.

This work has been partially supported by the INTAS grant N2 06-10000012-8845. We

viding us a 137Cs radioactive source for our gamma irradiation studies.

1. Introduction

Abstract. An experimental report on the construction and operation of a
lead-glass calorimeter at the CERN-NA49 experiment is presented.

After the exciting and interesting RHIC results on suppression of high pT particles in
very high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions – and their absence for proton-nucleus
reactions – it is reasonable to ask: what about lower, SPS, energies, do we see
anything interesting there?

In case of proton-nucleus collisions the enhancement of high pT particles com-
pared to nucleon-nucleon collisions is the well known Cronin-eﬀect. Some recent
calculation of this phenomenon for SPS energy is given in Ref. [ 1]. As the data
available from experiments are scarce (e.g. unpublished analysis from WA98), it is
worthwhile to measure high pT particles, for example neutral pions, with a small
supplement using the existing detector system of the NA49 experiment. Its com-
pletion can also help when making exclusive studies, because the experiment up to
now could detect charged particles only, with the exception of neutrons.

The NA49 experiment is a large acceptance hadron detector for charged parti-
cles (Fig. 1). Although the SPS is closed, our group got 10 days of running in 2003,
in order to test a lead-glass detector prototype, put behind the time projection
chambers. For most of the particles having photonic decay one has acceptance in
the central region.

2. OPAL end cap electromagnetic calorimeter

The hardware for the new detector came from the OPAL experiment which ﬁnished
data-taking in 2000. During the dismantling big part of the end cap calorimeter
hardware and electronics [ 2] was salvaged. The calorimeter functions in the fol-
lowing way. The incoming γ creates an electromagnetic shower, which produces
Cherenkov light. The lead-glass has good light transmission below 400 nm and it is
long enough, thus a shower is easily contained. The light is converted to electronic
signal, by the vacuum photo triode, and it is further ampliﬁed. The triode contains
one dynode only, meaning small ampliﬁcation. The unit is sensitive to magnetic
ﬁelds but also tolerates high voltage changes. The device has acceptable resolution
in the percent range and enables hadron-electron separation.

The resulting negative signals are integrated by a dual 12 bit charge integrating
ADC of the type CIAFB F583C [ 3]. It digitizes 96 channels, measuring both the
signal and the ampliﬁed one, thus achieving 15 bit dynamic range. The device can
be gated from the front, but the generation of a test gate and a test pulse is also
possible. The device gives out the analog trigger output before conversion, thus it
may be used for triggering purposes. To enable fast clear, the conversion can be
delayed by 10-60 µs, the conversion time is 1 ms for 96 channels. The device was
used with 2 µs gate and read out via its Fastbus interface.

3. Assembly

A lead-glass wall with 16×12 units was assembled, giving 1.5 m2 sensitive area. Big
part of electronics was placed in the experimental area, see photos in Fig. 2.

In order to enhance events with photons, a photon-trigger has been developed
and built by the institute: electronic cards sum the signals from four adjacent
channels. The trigger thresholds can be set one-by-one via serial port, using a

graphical interface. The response time of the trigger is of the order of 0.5 µs,
depending on signal amplitude.

The data acquisition software runs on FIC 8234 machine, with Motorola 68040,
running OS-9 (interrupt handling, events, modules, semaphores). Fastbus is reached
via FVSBI interface. The software not only controls the measurement, but provides
an on-line display of the occurring hits in the detector.

4. Data taking

F. Sikl´er

As a ﬁrst check, data have been taken with triggering on cosmic particles (Fig. 3).
The obtained uncalibrated ADC spectrum, which in this sense is the energy spec-
trum, gives dependence close to 1/E2. By plotting the units separately one ﬁnds
that the gains are within 20-30%.

Due to problems with the accelerator and some chambers, half of the beam-
time was lost. Finally interactions of fragmented deuterons on liquid hydrogen
target with spectator proton trigger, n+p reactions, were taken. The photon-trigger,
mostly giving high pT π0s, appeared to be too slow: only minimum bias events were
recorded. Still, this data sample was enough for checking hit frequencies, event
multiplicities.

The ﬁrst attempt on reconstructing π0s failed, the correct determination of
pedestal and relative gain appears to be crucial. This information can be extracted
from the acquired data and the study of events with cosmics. Nevertheless an
absolute calibration with electron beam would be important.

5. Summary

Theoretical predictions and poor measurements of high pT particles at SPS show
that the project discussed above is reasonable. Using existing hardware parts a
working detector could be built which provided results only from some days of
running.

Full details of the analysis, with calibrated units and nice π0 mass spectrum, will
be available in the thesis of A. L´aszl´o. This would not have been possible without
the work of G. Vesztergombi and D. Varga, many graduate and PhD students,
with other researchers of the institute. This work is supported by the Hungarian

Abstract

We present results of simulations of transitions in planar arrays of superheated
superconducting granules (PASS) immersed in an external magnetic ﬁeld parallel
to the system. Analysis of the behaviour of the system when the external ﬁeld
is slowly increased from zero shows the existence of an interval of external ﬁelds
for which no transitions are produced. This gap is found to be a consequence of
ordering induced by transitions. However, this ordering is diﬀerent for diluted and
for concentrated systems. Avalanches of diﬀerent sizes with distributions depending
on concentration are observed.

1 Introduction

Experiments on dispersions of superheated superconducting granules (SSG)
have investigated the feasibility of these systems as detectors of neutrinos, dark
matter and other particles [1]. In these devices an ensemble of superconducting
type I microgranules are maintained in a metastable superheated state by
adequate conditions of temperature and external ﬁeld. If a particle or radiation
with enough energy collides with a microgranule it can produce a transition
to the normal conducting state. The disappearance of the Meissner eﬀect,
inherent to the transition, produces a change in the magnetic ﬂux that can be
detected by a magnetometer.

Despite their promising applications, some intrinsic features of SSG limit the
eﬃciency of these detectors. The metastability of each grain of the suspension
depends on its shape and surface quality and on the diamagnetic interactions
with the other microgranules. Dispersion in size combined with these eﬀects
produces a spread of transition ﬁelds of about 20%, which aﬀects the accuracy
of these devices.

Planar systems of microgranules arrayed in a regular conﬁguration (PASS)
have been presented as an alternative to SSG to reduce this spread [2]. The
present manufacturing techniques of PASS devices can only produce arrays of a
relatively small size, but with good sensitivity in both energy and position. The
regular arrangement allows the control of magnetic interactions. Furthermore,
the photolithographic procedure employed in their manufacture enables micro-
granules with excellent uniformity in shape and size to be obtained. Although
these characteristics do not completely eliminate the dispersion of superheated
transition ﬁeld values, reductions of an order of magnitude have been observed
[2]. α On the other hand, the regular spatial conﬁguration and the greater
uniformity in shape and size of these systems suggest the possibility of the
presence of avalanches that could amplify the magnetic signal. Avalanches are
a consequence of diamagnetic interactions between grains, which screen the
magnetic ﬁeld of neighbouring granules. The transition of a simple grain can
reduce or eliminate this screening in such a way that the maximum surface
ﬁeld of the nearest granules can increase. Consequently, transitions in sev-
eral neighbours can occur almost simultaneously. Diﬀusion of released heat,
inherent to any ﬁrst-order transition could also produce transitions in neigh-
bouring grains. This avalanche eﬀect could be useful for devices with very
small granules to provide high-energy sensitivity or a triggering mechanism in
high-energy particle experiments.

Avalanche experiments have been carried out on PASS devices with diﬀerent
geometries, such as regular square conﬁgurations immersed in a magnetic ﬁeld
perpendicular to the plane, or systems of a few lines of microgranules with the
magnetic ﬁeld applied along the lines. Results of these experiments show that
the simultaneous ﬂip of several granules are produced in these latter systems
with a higher incidence than in the square conﬁguration [3]. The existence of
partial avalanches and a lack of transitions of complete lines were explained
as a consequence of imperfections in the manufacturing process [3].

We have performed extensive simulations of transitions in PASS systems im-
mersed in an increasing external ﬁeld in both perpendicular and parallel mag-
netic ﬁeld set-ups. Results from the perpendicular case were presented in Ref.
[4], showing a reduction of the spread in transition ﬁelds, analogous to that
experimentally observed. In the same work, and in agreement with other au-
thors [5], the existence of a gap or interval of external ﬁeld values for which
no transitions occur was shown for concentrated systems. This corresponds

2

to a hot border, in which only transitions by increasing temperature can be
produced [6]. This gap, which appears in concentrated conﬁgurations, but not
in dilute systems, was related to transitions occurring in preferential posi-
tions, which induced spatial ordering. The presence of this ordering was found
to be consistent with the value of the fraction f of remaining superconduct-
ing microgranules for which the gap appears. This eﬀect could have relevant
consequences on the minimum energy detected by experimental detectors.

In this work we present the results corresponding to the other case: transitions
in planar arrays with the magnetic ﬁeld applied parallel to the system. A gap
or plateau zone in the transition ﬁeld values will be shown to exist for con-
centrated conﬁgurations, but not for dilute ones, for microgranules assumed
to be microspheres with defects on their surface. This eﬀect is similar to that
produced in the perpendicular external ﬁeld case, but appears for a higher
fraction f of remaining superconducting microgranules. The avalanche eﬀect
is hardly observed in these concentrated systems. An additional analysis is
performed on PASS with more perfect grains in order to reduce the inﬂuence
of the defects on the response of the system. In this case all conﬁgurations,
both concentrated and dilute, present plateau zones, but are shown to cor-
respond to two types of diﬀerent behaviour depending on lattice distance.
For separated spheres, transitions are produced in such a way that remain-
ing superconducting spheres are ordered on complete lines when the plateau
appears. After this zone, avalanches corresponding to transitions of these com-
plete lines are observed. On the contrary, transitions in conﬁgurations with
smaller lattice distances produce a quasi-homogeneous spatial distribution of
remaining superconducting spheres in the plateau zone. Furthermore, there
are a smaller number of avalanches in the evolution of these concentrated
systems, but which involve a larger number of spheres. We will explain the
appearance of the plateau zone and develop a criterion to determine the lattice
distance value that separates the two types of behaviour.

These results are presented in this paper as follows: in the next section tran-
sitions undergone by systems corresponding to diﬀerent lattice distances are
analyzed. Section III is devoted to studying the behaviour of more perfect
granules. Spatial order produced by transitions, the existence of a plateau and
the value of the fraction f of spheres that remain superconducting for which
it appears are explained in this section. The avalanche eﬀect is described in
Section IV. Section V provides our conclusions.

2 Transitions

We perform simulations of transitions on systems of superheated supercon-
ducting microgranules in an increasing external magnetic ﬁeld Bext. Micro-

3

granules are considered as spheres of equal radius a, much larger than the
London penetration length. Results presented in this paper correspond to
planar conﬁgurations of spheres ordered on square lattices immersed in an
external ﬁeld applied parallel to the lines of spheres. To take into account the
existence of possible defects on spheres we assign a random threshold mag-
netic ﬁeld value Bth to each sphere following a distribution related to the
superheated value BSH. This distribution takes the form of a parabolic distri-
∆) and BSH. A larger value
bution in an interval of values between BSH(1
of delta is related to a larger range of defects. Results presented in this section
correspond to a ∆ = 0.2 value in agreement with experimental estimations for
tin spheres [7]. We then consider that the transition of a sphere occurs when
the maximum surface ﬁeld at any point on its surface reaches its threshold
value, and that the transition is complete. We further assume that the la-
tent heat corresponding to transitions is small enough so as not to aﬀect bath
temperature and not to originate transitions in neighbouring spheres.

−

The method of calculus in our simulations is as follows: N spheres are placed
at the vertices of a planar square lattice with the lattice parameter d giv-
ing the distance between neighbours. Without loss of generality, we place the
system in the plane XZ and (lx, lz) are the coordinates of the spheres, After
assigning a random threshold ﬁeld value to each sphere, the system is im-
mersed in an external magnetic ﬁeld Bext, applied in the Z direction, which
is slowly increased from zero. Resolution of the Laplace equation for the mag-
netic scalar potential with the appropriate boundary conditions enables the
surface magnetic ﬁeld to be known on each microsphere. We have used a nu-
merical procedure that allows us both to consider the complete multi-body
problem and to reach multipolar contributions of an arbitrary order [8]. When
the maximum local magnetic ﬁeld on the surface of any sphere reaches its
threshold value Bth, the sphere transits and the conﬁguration becomes one
of N
1 superconducting spheres. Interactions between remaining supercon-
ducting microgranules change after each transition, due to the long range of
diamagnetic interactions. This leads us to repeat the process until all spheres
have transited. The applied ﬁeld for which each sphere transits, and the max-
imum surface magnetic ﬁeld value of each sphere are monitored after each
transition, allowing us to study the evolution of the system in the successive
transitions.

Numerical simulations have been performed on several conﬁgurations with
distances between sphere centres, in units of radius a, of d/a = 4.376, 3.473,
3.034, 2.757 and 2.5. In a 3-D array these distances correspond to values of
ﬁlling factors (fraction of volume occupied by the spheres), of ρ = 0.05, 0.10,
0.15, 0.20 and 0.268. The number of spheres was N = 169, that is a 13

tion of remaining superconducting spheres versus the increasing external ﬁeld
(in units of BSH) is represented for several lattice distances. We can observe
an increase in the spread of transition ﬁelds as lattice distance decreases,
as a consequence of the stronger diamagnetic interactions. The ﬁrst transi-
tions, produced at the smallest external ﬁeld values, correspond in all cases to
spheres placed at the centre of both the top and bottom borders of the system,
which have the maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld. This is because diamagnetic
interactions between microgranules produce a screening eﬀect, especially in
the direction of the applied ﬁeld. This can be seen in Fig. 2, where maximum
surface ﬁelds for spheres on a central line of granules, parallel to the external
magnetic ﬁeld, and on a line at the lateral border are represented for two
diﬀerent lattice distances. However, the most relevant feature of Fig. 1 is the
appearance, in concentrated conﬁgurations, of a gap or plateau zone corre-
sponding to an interval of external ﬁeld values for which no transition occurs.
This plateau appears at a fraction of spheres that remain superconducting at
approximately f = 0.41. In this zone, ﬂips to the normal state can only be

induced by thermal nucleation. In this sense, this eﬀect corresponds to a hot
border [6]. This behaviour is apparently similar to that observed in systems
immersed in a perpendicular applied magnetic ﬁeld [4], but here the plateau
appears for a higher f value.

The reason why the plateau appears in concentrated systems, but not in di-
lute ones, can be related to the diﬀerent dynamics in the evolution of the
system during the transitions. We have analyzed the dynamics by studying
the evolution of both maximum surface magnetic ﬁelds and spatial distribu-
tions. Fig. 3 shows such an evolution for two representative cases. The ﬁrst,
Fig. 3.a, is a concentrated conﬁguration with lattice distance d/a = 2.5 (that
would correspond to a ﬁlling factor of ρ = 26.8% in 3-D systems) and whose
evolution presents the plateau zone. The second, in Fig. 3.b, is a dilute system
(d/a = 4.38, ρ = 5%). Distributions of maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld are
represented for both conﬁgurations and correspond to values of fraction of
spheres that remain superconducting f = 1 (initial state, all spheres super-
conducting), f = 0.71 (120 superconducting spheres), f = 0.45, (74 super-
conducting spheres, which correspond to some transitions before the plateau)
and f = 0.41 (69 superconducting spheres, when the plateau appears in the

concentrated case). It can be seen that initial distributions present diﬀerent
intervals of maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld values that are larger for concen-
trated systems and which are a sign of the relevance of diamagnetic interac-
tions. However, a similar distribution in the two separated branches is shown
for both concentrations. The smaller branch, with higher surface magnetic val-
ues, corresponds to spheres placed at both the top and bottom borders of the
system. Some of these will be the next spheres to transit. Transitions change
the maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld values in a large number of spheres. There
is competition between the increment of surface magnetic ﬁeld, due to the
reduction of the screening eﬀect, and the decreasing number of interacting
microgranules. For concentrated systems a change in the population of the
two branches is produced, with an increment in the distance between both
branches. The complete disappearance of the upper branch causes the system
to enter the plateau zone and only granules with low surface magnetic ﬁeld
values remain superconducting, and are thus far from their threshold values.
They need much larger external ﬁelds to ﬂip to normal state. This explains
the appearance of the plateau. On the contrary, the two initial branches merge
and change to a more continuous distribution after some transitions in dilute
systems. Slight increments of the applied ﬁeld are able to produce subsequent
transitions and therefore no gap interval is observed.

Relating these types of behaviour with the position of the ensemble of spheres
in a phase diagram, this evolution could be described in the following way:
the initial state could be represented by a set of points along a vertical line at

the bath temperature, distributed into two separated segments, one of which
is near the superheated line (Fig. 4.a). Each point represents the state (T,H)
of a sphere and, consequently, the upper segment shows the population cor-
responding to the upper ﬁeld branch. The separation between the segments
coincides with the separation between both branches. Changes in diamagnetic
interactions by transitions produce a change in the population of each seg-
ment. In dilute conﬁgurations a connection of both segments is produced and
the phase diagram presents a population with an approximately continuous
distribution below the superheated line. On the the other hand, transitions in
concentrated systems are produced in such a way that the two segments re-
main separated until the upper segment disappears (Fig. 4.b). It is at this stage
that the plateau zone appears. Remaining superconducting spheres correspond
to the population of the remaining segment, separated from the superheated
line. This eﬀect, for each temperature, describes a hot border line in the phase
diagram separated from the superheated line by an interval of magnetic ﬁelds
corresponding to the plateau zone gap.

We have studied the relation between surface magnetic distributions and spa-
tial distributions of the remaining superconducting spheres. The evolution
of these spatial distributions present distinct features depending on the con-
centration of the system, as is shown in Fig. 5 for two representative cases
(d/a = 2.5 and 4.376 respectively). It can be observed that transitions in con-
centrated systems produce, when the plateau appears, two separated domains
with diﬀerent kinds of spatial order. For both domains the tendency is not
to have any superconducting next neighbour in the direction perpendicular to
the external ﬁeld. While spheres of the ﬁrst domain are mainly placed along
vertical lines, a tendency to align along the diagonal direction is observed for
the other domain. Dilute systems only show partial lines of superconducting

3 Defect-free granules

Results presented above correspond to spheres with a relatively large range of
defects. It is well known that defects can act as nucleation centres and therefore
transitions are produced at smaller external ﬁelds than in more perfect spheres.
This fact could have an inﬂuence on the dynamics of the system, because it can
alter spatial distributions and thus diamagnetic interactions between spheres
after transitions.

In order to gain insight into the intrinsic dynamics of the evolution of these
systems, we have reduced the inﬂuence of defects and analyzed the response
of systems formed by nearly perfect spheres. Results are obtained following
the same calculus protocol, but the threshold magnetic ﬁeld distribution is
changed in a smaller interval, that is using a smaller ∆ value. In this section
the value selected is ∆ = 10−6.

Fig. 6 displays the fraction f of remaining superconducting spheres as a func-
tion of the external ﬁeld for two lattice distances, d/a = 2.5 and 3.473 (26, 8%
and 10% respectively), comparing the results obtained for ∆ = 0.2 and 10−6.
The reduction of the spread in transition ﬁelds for the lower delta value is
observed in this ﬁgure, although the inﬂuence of diamagnetic interactions is
clearly seen in the wider interval of transition ﬁelds shown by the more con-

centrated systems. On the other hand, the more discontinuous aspect of these
transition lines for ∆ = 10−6 suggests the possibility of a more important
avalanche eﬀect. A further signiﬁcant feature in the ﬁgure is the appearance
of a plateau zone for dilute conﬁgurations. Calculations on diﬀerent lattice
distance values show the existence of such plateau zones in all conﬁgurations.
This zone is larger for small lattice distances. In addition, the plateau is pro-
duced near the f = 0.45 value, i.e. slightly higher than in spheres with defects.
This plateau appears in dilute systems for a fraction of remaining supercon-
ducting spheres of about f = 0.47.

This change in the behaviour of the system due to the inﬂuence of defects,
especially in larger lattice distances, and the value of f for the appearance
of the plateau, can be related to the diﬀerent dynamics shown in their evolu-
tion, reﬂected in both spatial and surface magnetic ﬁeld distributions. Maxi-
mum surface ﬁeld distributions corresponding to systems with lattice distances
d/a = 2.5 and 3.473 are displayed in Fig. 7. The concentrated case (Fig. 7.a)

presents an evolution similar to those of spheres with defects, showing the two
branches until the disappearance of that corresponding to higher surface ﬁeld
values when the plateau appears. The only diﬀerences are the slightly smaller
interval of values of the surface magnetic ﬁeld and the fact that the upper
branch disappears at a larger value of f . The dilute conﬁguration (Fig. 7.b)
presents, on the other hand, a qualitative change in its evolution. The two
branches of the initial distribution split into several close branches after suc-
cessive transitions. In the plateau zone (f = 0.46) the surface magnetic ﬁelds
of the remaining superconducting spheres are in a smaller interval, quite far
from their threshold values. A larger increment of the applied ﬁeld is therefore
necessary to produce the next transition. This is the reason for the appearance
of the plateau in this case. This gap in external ﬁeld values originates a hot
border zone analogous to the concentrated case. Only a temperature increase
in this zone can originate a ﬂip to the normal state.

The changes in magnetic surface ﬁeld distributions, especially for dilute sys-
tems, suggest a change in the evolution of spatial distributions with respect
to less perfect spheres. The study of spatial distributions during transitions
reveals interesting behaviour. The more perfect spheres present ordered con-
ﬁgurations at the plateau, both for concentrated and dilute systems, but the
order is clearly diﬀerent, as is shown in Fig. 8. Evolution in dilute systems is
produced in such a way that, when the plateau appears, remaining supercon-
ducting spheres display a spatial disposition in complete lines parallel to the
external ﬁeld alternating with complete lines of spheres in the normal conduct-

ing state. This spatial distribution explains the f value for which the plateau
appears. Perfect alternation of superconducting and normal lines would corre-
spond to a f = 0, 5 value. A small deviation of perfect alternation is coherent
with the f = 0.47 value obtained for these dilute systems. Repeating simula-
tions for diﬀerent lattice distance values, we observe that this kind of order
is achieved for conﬁgurations with lattice distance values d/a = 3.034 and
larger, but not for d/a = 2.757 or 2.5.

For more concentrated systems the remaining superconducting spheres appear
on the plateau aligned in the diagonal direction, i .e. with next neighbours in
the normal state, but with superconducting second neighbours. Hence, micro-
granules present a square lattice conﬁguration with a parameter of √2d value.
This fact corresponds to a f = 0.5 value for the plateau zone. Defects in this
ordering can be seen as boundaries between perfectly ordered domains and
their eﬀect is to slightly reduce this value to the obtained f = 0.46.

×

The existence of one or another kind of order depends on the concentration of
the systems. We have developed a criterion to determine the limit of lattice
distances that separates the two diﬀerent dynamics. For this criterion we con-
sider a conﬁguration similar to that of the domains present in concentrated
systems. We have simulated systems of 81 superconducting spheres placed on
a 9
18 array in the diagonal conﬁguration. An additional superconducting
sphere is placed in the middle of the 9th row, i.e. nearly in the centre of the
system and with 4 nearest neighbours. A scheme of this conﬁguration is pre-
sented in the inset of Fig. 9. The extra grain should be the ﬁrst to transit to
achieve the order present in concentrated systems. In another case this order
is not possible. We have calculated the maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld val-
ues on all spheres of this conﬁguration for several values of lattice distances.
Results of these simulations are shown in the Fig 9 for domains correspond-

ing to d/a = 3.473 and 2.756 respectively. In this ﬁgure maximum surface
ﬁeld values on the extra sphere (full symbols) and the values corresponding
to spheres with the same lz coordinate, shown by the dashed line in the inset
of the ﬁgure, are represented. It can be observed that, for the lower lattice
distance value, the extra sphere has a higher surface magnetic ﬁeld than its
neighbours so it will be the next one to transit. Consequently, the conﬁgu-
ration can present the order observed in concentrated systems. On the other
hand, for d/a = 3.437 the maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld on the central
sphere is smaller than on its neighbours, one of which will be the next to
transit, so it is thus impossible to achieve such an ordering of the domain. By
repeating simulations for additional intermediate lattice distances we can ﬁnd
the limiting value for which the change of behaviour is produced. We obtain
this limit for a distance between sphere centres of d/a = 2.921 (ρ = 16.8%).
Results displayed in Fig. 10 near this limit clearly show this change.

4 Avalanche eﬀect

Avalanches can occur in SSG systems. The transition of any microgranule
changes diamagnetic interactions in the system, especially between its neigh-
bouring granules. Depending on the relative position of the microgranules and
on the direction of the applied ﬁeld, a transition of a single grain can then
produce the ﬂip of other microspheres to the normal state.

This eﬀect can be useful in detecting low-energy radiation. To produce the
transition of a microgranule to the normal state a quantity of energy propor-
tional to the volume of the grain is necessary in the global heating model [9].
In this sense, a device composed of small microspheres could act as an ul-
trasensitive low-energy detector. The change of magnetic ﬂux induced by the
loss of the Meissner eﬀect could be ampliﬁed if an avalanche of transitions is
produced. The enhancement of the signal would permit the detection of the
incident particle or radiation. In addition, the ampliﬁed signal could be used
as a trigger in high- energy experiments.

PASS systems with the external ﬁeld parallel to the plane seem suitable sys-
tems to show avalanches. Diamagnetic interactions can favour the screening
eﬀect of a granule on neighbours, mainly on those placed on lines parallel to

the external ﬁeld. The maximum surface magnetic ﬁeld is, in consequence,
lower on internal spheres than on the spheres at the top and bottom borders.
Transition of a sphere to the normal state allows the introduction of mag-
netic ﬁeld lines around their neighbours due to the reduction of screening,
and increases their surface magnetic ﬁeld. Some of the spheres can achieve
their threshold magnetic ﬁeld values and transit simultaneously producing an
avalanche.

Results from simulations on systems with defect-free spheres are coherent with
the existence of avalanches. Fig. 11 shows the fraction of remaining supercon-
ducting spheres in an increasing external ﬁeld for several lattice distance val-
ues. The shape of transition lines indicates that a great number of transitions
are produced at very close values of the applied ﬁeld indicating an avalanche
eﬀect.

A deeper study shows that ﬁrst avalanches correspond, in all conﬁgurations, to
simultaneous transitions of two or four spheres placed at the borders, reﬂecting

15

the top-bottom and left-right symmetry. After this initial transition, systems
present clearly diﬀerentiated behaviour depending on the lattice distances.

In dilute systems the next avalanches, of 2 or 4 spheres, are only produced
in lines that have undergone previous transitions. They include transitions of
both top- and bottom-ending superconducting spheres. When 3
4 spheres at
both ends have transited on each of these lines, an avalanche of the remaining
superconducting spheres of the line takes place. This situation corresponds
to the appearance of the plateau zone, with a spatial distribution of only
complete lines of spheres that remain superconducting. An increment of the
external ﬁeld larger than the gap value generates successive avalanches of
complete lines.

−

In concentrated systems, on the other hand, initial avalanches of spheres at
the borders are followed by a small number of simultaneous transitions of 2 or
4 spheres in alternate sites near the top and bottom borders. A further small
increment of the applied ﬁeld produces a large avalanche. This avalanche in-
cludes a large number of spheres following the same alternate pattern. After
this avalanche the plateau zone appears. Remaining superconducting spheres
are located in several domains with regular square distributions. The next
avalanches correspond to simultaneous transitions of spheres from each do-
main.

In Fig. 12 the number of observed avalanches versus their size (the number of
spheres that are involved) are represented for several lattice distances. Results
show that large avalanches only appear for concentrated systems. On the con-
trary, dilute conﬁgurations show a higher number of small-size avalanches.

Experimental devices can make use of this eﬀect by placing the detector in the
desired zone of transition lines. Knowledge of the diﬀerent types of behaviour
of the system enables selection of the type of conﬁguration according to the
required size of avalanche. It should be pointed out that the experimental
precision could not be suﬃcient to resolve very close avalanches, which in
consequence would be detected as a single ﬂip.

Experimental results presented by Meagher et al [3] correspond to a system of
separated lines (l/a = 16.66) of closed spheres (d/a = 2.22). It is thus a type of
conﬁguration diﬀerent from that studied here and could be considered to be a
hybrid of both the concentrated and diluted conﬁgurations. It could therefore
show intermediate behaviour. This could explain the absence of avalanches of
complete lines observed in these experiments.

This study can be extended to other geometrical conﬁgurations of superheated
superconducting granules than can favour some types of multiple ﬂip. Simula-
tions of experimental systems and diﬀerent superpositions of planar structures
are presently in progress.

5 Conclusions

Simulations of transitions in PASS systems immersed in a parallel external
ﬁeld have been performed for several lattice distance values. Spheres with
defects on their surface, which can act as nucleation centres, and quasi defect-
free spheres are considered. A plateau zone is observed in concentrated systems
for both kinds of spheres. This zone corresponds to a gap in the external ﬁeld
values that are able to produce transitions. On the other hand, for large lattice
distances the plateau only appears for more perfect spheres. This plateau
corresponds to a hot border, in which only transitions by a ﬁnite temperature
increment can be produced. This eﬀect can have relevant consequences in
experimental detectors due to the fact that the uncertainty in the energy
threshold for transitions can be reduced. On the other hand, transitions in
this zone could characterize the emission spectrum of a source of radiation.

The existence of the plateau and the fraction of remaining superconducting
spheres for which it appears are explained as a consequence of two diﬀerent
dynamics during transitions, for dilute and concentrated conﬁgurations respec-

17

tively, which lead to two diﬀerent spatial orders. Systems with small lattice
distances present, at the plateau zone, a distribution on domains where the su-
perconducting spheres are homogeneously located. Dynamics for larger lattice
distances generates, at the plateau zone, an ordering of spheres that remain
superconducting on complete lines parallel to the external ﬁeld at the plateau
zone. This ordering is consistent with the fraction value of remaining supercon-
ducting spheres for which the plateau appears. A criterion has been developed
in order to ﬁnd the limit between the two distinguishable dynamics. This limit
is obtained for a distance between spheres of d/a = 2.921 (ρ = 16.8% in 3-D
systems).

A study of the avalanches produced in these systems shows distinct types
of behaviour depending on the lattice distance values. Concentrated systems
present, after small initial avalanches corresponding to the ﬁrst transitions, a
large avalanche before the gap is reached. After this zone, successive avalanches
corresponding to transitions of spheres from each domain are observed. Dilute
conﬁgurations show relatively small avalanches before the plateau appears.
After this zone, successive avalanches of complete lines are produced. These
eﬀects could be used in experimental devices to detect low-energy radiation
that can be ampliﬁed by multiple transitions.

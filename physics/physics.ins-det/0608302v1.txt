Abstract

In this report, we present the energy calibration of the Hall B bremsstrahlung tagging system
at the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator Facility. The calibration was performed using a
magnetic pair spectrometer. The tagged photon energy spectrum was measured in coincidence
with e+e− pairs as a function of the pair spectrometer magnetic ﬁeld. Taking advantage of the
internal linearity of the pair spectrometer, the energy of the tagging system was calibrated at the
level of ±0.1%Eγ . The absolute energy scale was determined using the e+e− rate measurements
close to the end-point of the photon spectrum. The energy variations across the full tagging
range were found to be < 3 MeV.

In this report, we present the method and the results of the energy calibration of the
Hall B photon tagging system [1] at the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator Facility
(JLab). The Hall B tagging system is the ﬁrst photon tagger in the multi-GeV energy
range with high energy resolution (∼ 0.1%Eγ) and a broad tagging range, 20% to 95%
of E0. It is used for the investigation of real photon induced reactions, primarily in
conjunction with the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS) [2]. The tagging
range of the device is divided into 767 energy bins (E-bins). In each E-bin, the central
value of the energy is used as the energy of the radiated photon. These values were
generated by a ray-tracing program using the design geometry of the scintillation counter
hodoscope (384 overlapping counters, called E-counters) and the two-dimensional ﬁeld
map of the dipole magnet.

In the analysis of fully exclusive reactions, such as photoproduction on deuterium 1 , it
was found that the photon energy deﬁned by CLAS and the central values of the E-bins
of tagged photons are diﬀerent by as much as 0.5%. The variation of this diﬀerence as
a function of the tagger E-counter position was compatible with a possible sag of the
frames which hold the E-counters. There was corroborating evidence from simulations
of the eﬀects of gravitational sagging and various possible misalignments of the tagger
focal plane [4].

To determine corrections to the central value of energy in each E-bin independent of
CLAS, the tagged photon energy spectrum was measured in coincidence with e+e− pairs
detected in the Hall-B pair spectrometer (PS)[5]. The data were collected as a function
of the PS dipole ﬁeld and at ﬁxed geometry of the e+e− detectors. These measurements,
taking advantage of the linear relationship between momentum and the magnetic ﬁeld
of the PS, allowed for the relative calibration of E-bins with high accuracy. Using mea-
surements of e+e− coincidence rates at PS settings close to the end-point energy, the
absolute energy scale of the tagging system was calibrated as well. The energy correction
factor for each E-bin is deﬁned as the ratio of photon energy, determined from momenta
of e+e− pairs, to the ideal central value of the energy of that E-bin.

To calculate the momenta of the e+ and e−, a simpliﬁed model for a homogeneous
dipole was employed, using the central value of the ﬁeld and the positions of the particle

calculate the photon energy from the momenta of the charged particles [3].

trajectories at the entrance and exit of the ﬁeld region. Two corrections were introduced
to the model based on ray-tracing simulations using measured and generated ﬁeld maps
to account for non-linearities in the ﬁeld distribution and for the ﬁnite beam and detector
sizes.

For these measurements, the PS was instrumented with micro-strip detectors for better
position determination of e+ and e−, and thus better energy resolution. Based on the
level of knowledge of the PS dipole ﬁeld distribution and the position of the micro-strip
detectors, the accuracy of the method is estimated to be δEγ ∼ ±0.1%Eγ.

2. Experimental setup and the measurements

The data were collected during a photoproduction experiment in April of 2004 using
the Hall B bremsstrahlung tagging system and the pair spectrometer. The description of
the tagging system can be found in Ref. [1], a schematic view of the setup is shown in
Fig. 1. The photon beam was generated in the interaction of a Ee = 3.776 GeV electron
beam with a 10−4 radiation length thick Au foil (“Radiator”). The tagger dipole magnet
was operated at 1273 A current (corresponding to the central ﬁeld value of 1.0627 T)
and covered the tagged photon energy range from 0.9 to 3.6 GeV. The Hall B pair
spectrometer is located ∼ 10 meters downstream of the “Radiator.” The PS consists of a
dipole magnet and two planes of scintillation counters, positioned symmetrically to the
left and the right of the beam axis in the horizontal plane downstream of the magnet.
The pair production converter, “Pair converter”, is located 55.8 cm upstream of the PS
dipole center and consists of 10−3 radiation length thick Aluminum.

For this measurement, in addition to the scintillation detectors, the PS was instru-
mented with two pairs of micro-strip detectors (MS) to provide better position determi-
nation for the e+e− behind the dipole. They were mounted 93.07 cm downstream of the
magnet center, in front of the scintillation counters. Each pair of micro-strip detectors
consisted of X and Y planes and covered 20×20mm2 of detection acceptance. (The (XZ)
plane is deﬁned by the centerline of the beam and the deﬂection plane of the dipole. The
main ﬁeld component is parallel to the Y axis). The distance between the centroids of
the “X” planes was 450 ± 0.5mm, and they were centered on the beam axis. The pitch
size of the micro-strip detectors was 50µm. In the oﬀ-line analysis, only one of the “Y”
planes was used, since the micro-strip for the second “Y” plane had a high noise level.

The measurements were conducted at a large number of settings of the PS dipole
ﬁeld in the range from 0.36 to 1.3 Tesla which corresponds to PS currents from 543A
to 2278A. At this range of the ﬁeld values, the energy range of e+e− covered almost
the full energy range of the tagging system, see Fig. 2. The PS magnetic ﬁeld value was
measured with a Hall probe positioned at the center of the magnet. The accuracy of the
device in the range of the measured ﬁelds is better than 10−3. The entire data taking
process was automated. At each ﬁeld setting, data were acquired for 15 minutes of real
beam time with a beam current > 5 nA. A total of 180 points at diﬀerent ﬁeld values
were measured.

For the determination of the absolute energy scale, data were taken at PS ﬁeld values
from 1.35 to 1.9 Tesla, corresponding to currents from 2073A to 2775A, without requir-
ing a coincidence with the tagging system. At these ﬁeld values, the sum of energies of
the detected e+ and e− covered the range slightly below and above the electron beam

energy (the end-point of the bremsstrahlung spectrum). Measurements of the e+e− co-
incidence rate at a ﬁxed acceptance of the detectors allowed us to relate the PS ﬁeld
values to the electron beam energy. Using this relation, the absolute energy scale in the
pair spectrometer was deﬁned.

3. Data analysis

A coincidence signal from the scintillator counters of the pair spectrometer was used
to form a trigger for the DAQ system. For each trigger, time information from the tagger
E- and T -counters and the amplitude of the signals in each channel of the micro-strip
detectors were recorded. Information on beam current, beam position, and magnetic ﬁeld
settings was inserted into the data stream every 10 seconds during data taking.

In the oﬀ-line analysis, events with tagger hits within 15ns relative to the trigger were
used. Hits in the tagger are selected using a tight timing coincidence between E-counters
and the corresponding T -counter. The inset in Fig. 2 shows the tagged photon energy
distribution at a single setting of the PS dipole ﬁeld (0.97 T) for selected tagger hits.
The accidental background in the tagger was of the order of 1%.

For the determination of the intersection point of e+e− trajectories with the plane of
micro-strip detectors, only channels with ADC values that were above the pedestal by
more than ﬁve standard deviations were selected. Valid hits in both “X” planes and in
one “Y” plane were required. The distributions of the number of hits in these planes
are shown in Fig. 3. A small fraction of events with more than 3 hits in X1, Y 1, or X2
planes was rejected. For the ﬁnal analysis, events with 2 or 3 hits in a given plane were
accepted if 2 of these hits were adjacent (the requirement of adjacent hits rejected only
few events). In the bottom panel of Fig. 3, the number of adjacent hits vs. the number
of hits on the X1 plane is plotted. The distributions in the Y 1 and the X2 planes were
similar. The hatched boxes on the graph correspond to the criteria for the event selection.
For adjacent hits, the position on the plane is calculated as a weighted average using the
ADC values.

To reduce uncertainties due to the PS angular acceptance, the e+e− scattering plane

was limited to ±0.25 cm around the detector mid-plane.

4. Tagger energy corrections

The derivation of corrections to the tagger energy is performed in two steps. First, the
mean values of the ratio of the photon energy, measured in the PS, to the central value
of the E-bins were calculated. Then, these mean values were scaled by the ratio of the
electron beam energy to the end-point energy measured in the PS.

The photon energy is deﬁned as a sum of the e+e− energies reconstructed in the PS.
The energies of the electron and the positron were reconstructed in a simpliﬁed model
for charged particle propagation through the magnetic ﬁeld. The ratios were calculated
on an event-by-event basis for each E-bin that was within the acceptance range of the
PS at a given ﬁeld setting.

The scale factor for the absolute energy determination in PS was derived from studies

of the e+e− coincidence rate as a function of the energy reconstructed in PS.

4.1. Model for photon energy reconstruction in PS

In Fig. 1, the particle trajectories passing through the magnetic ﬁeld of the PS dipole
magnet are shown by the solid-lines. For each event, the transverse displacements of the
trajectories from the beam centerline (d) for the e+ and the e− were measured in the
micro-strip detector plane. The momenta of leptons (P ) were calculated in a model that
assumes a uniform ﬁeld distribution between the two points along the trajectory of the
particle. In this approximation the momentum can be expressed as a linear function of
the magnetic ﬁeld strength, B, and the radius of curvature, R:

where P is in GeV/c, B in Tesla, and R in meters. The radius of curvature is deﬁned as:

where Lef f is the eﬀective ﬁeld length, lp is the distance from the magnet center to the
detector plane, and de is the transverse displacement of the trajectory at the detector
plane.

The eﬀective ﬁeld length is deﬁned as:

were the integral is measured along the trajectory and B0 is the ﬁeld value in the center of
the magnet. The ratio was calculated using the simulation of trajectories by the Runge-
Kutta-Nystroem method and the ﬁeld map generated using a TOSCA [6] model for the
magnet. The generated ﬁeld map was used in the simulation due to the limited number
of measured points for the magnetic ﬁeld in the acceptance region of the setup. Figure
4 shows the dependence of Lef f on the magnetic ﬁeld for the central trajectory inside
the acceptance region of the detector. The drop of Lef f at high B0 is due to saturation

eﬀects. It was parametrized using a third order polynomial function for the range of ﬁeld
values > 0.8 T and a linear function for the range < 0.8T. The parameterization was
then used to calculate the particle momentum. The eﬀects of the ﬁnite detector sizes,
detector geometry, and the size of the beam on Lef f were convoluted into a correction
function, G(de+ , de−), as explained below. For data analysis, another correction function,
F (B0), was introduced to account for the diﬀerence between the generated and the real
ﬁeld distributions.

Eγ = (Ee+ + Ee− ) · G(de+ , de− ) · F (B0)

(4)

As shown below, using the simulated ﬁeld, the accuracy of the approximation of Eq.(4)

is better than the required accuracy for these measurements (< 10−3).

4.2. Correction for the detector geometry

In order to determine the function G(de+ , de− ), pairs of opposite sign trajectories,
originating from the same point at the pair converter T , were generated for several PS
ﬁeld values in a large momentum space. The simulations covered the full energy range of
measurements. The starting points of the trajectories were distributed in the transverse
direction according to the photon beam proﬁle, using a Gaussian with σ ≃ 1 mm. As a
correction function G(de+ , de− ), the ratio of the sum of generated momenta to the sum of
reconstructed momenta using Eq.(1) was deﬁned. In Fig. 5 the dependence of this ratio

8

on the distance between e+ and e− for the central ﬁeld value B0 = 0.3T is presented. An
almost linear dependence was observed with very small variations (< 0.3%) over a large
range of distances. The negative slope of the dependence reﬂects the fact that Lef f was
calculated for the central trajectory that corresponds to de+ + de− = 45 cm. For tracks
with de+ + de− < 45 cm (de+ + de− > 45 cm),
Bdl, and therefore the eﬀective ﬁeld
length, is smaller (bigger) than for the central trajectory. The overall scale of the ratio,
< 1, is due to an asymmetric distribution of the ﬁeld between tracks start and end points,
the MS plane is located farther from the magnet center than the pair converter. It should
be noted that in the detector geometry of the experiment, de+ + de− spans the range
from 43 to 47 cm. A third-degree polynomial function was used to ﬁt the dependence in
Fig. 5.

Similar dependences were obtained for several other ﬁeld settings. In Fig. 6, the dis-
tribution of the ratio for several ﬁeld values (up to 1.5 T), divided by the dependence
obtained at 0.3 T, is presented. The distribution is centered at unity with an RMS value
of 1.6 · 10−4, indicating that the function G(de+ + de− ) found at 0.3 T describes the
position dependence at all ﬁelds very well. The accuracy of the approximation used in
Eq.(1) is much better than 0.1%.

4.3. Correction for using a simulated ﬁeld

The eﬀective ﬁeld length was calculated based on the TOSCA-generated ﬁeld map [6].
In Fig. 7, a comparison of the generated (dots) and the measured (open squares) ﬁeld
distributions is presented. There is a small diﬀerence in the fringe ﬁeld and, therefore,

another correction factor was introduced to account for this diﬀerence. To derive this
Bdl values along the Z-axis for the measured and the TOSCA-
correction factor, the
calculated ﬁeld distributions were studied. Since the number of points where the B-
ﬁeld was measured was too small to deﬁne the integral along the real trajectories, we
compared integrals along the Z-axis. The ratio of these integrals was studied for four
diﬀerent transverse positions, X = 0 cm, X = 8.5 cm, X = 13.6 cm, and X = 18.7
cm. In Fig. 8.a, the dependence of the ratio on the magnetic ﬁeld value is shown. For
the X = 0 point, the Z-dependence of the ﬁeld was measured at eight settings and,
therefore, the ratio was deﬁned for eight ﬁeld settings. At X = 8.5 cm, X = 13.6 cm
and X = 18.7 cm, measurements are available for only ﬁve settings of the PS ﬁeld. The
absolute scale of the ratio depends on X, but the shape is similar for all X values. Since
the real trajectories cover a larger range of X, and the absolute energy scale will be
deﬁned by the end-point measurements (see below), the absolute scale of the ratio is not
important. For the analysis, the shape of the ﬁtted dependence, F (B), at X = 0 was
used. The uncertainty in the determination of the F (B) is the largest contribution to the
uncertainty in the ﬁnal corrections. As shown in Fig. 8.b, the estimated uncertainty of
F (B), based on the variations of r(X)/r(0) for single X, is ±0.05%.

4.4. Determination of the energy ratios

The distributions of the ratio Eγ/Ei

tag are shown in Fig. 9 for E-bins i = 76, 149, 391,
and 576. Similar distributions have been analyzed for all E-bins. The distributions are
ﬁtted to a sum of two Gaussians and a linear function. In the ﬁgure, ﬁt results are shown

with lines. The mean value, Ci, of the narrow Gaussian, that describes the main peak,
was used to determine the correction factor to the tagger energy.

5. End-point measurements

For a given detector acceptance, an increase of the magnetic ﬁeld value selects e+e−
pairs from higher energy photons, and at some point reaches the end-point energy, E0.
Measurements of the e+e− coincidence rate as a function of the ﬁeld value at ﬁxed
geometry allow to determine the relation between ﬁeld value and the end-point energy
of the photon beam. For these measurements the maximum energy of photons, or the
energy of the electron beam, was E0 = 3.776 GeV. This value was determined based
on independent energy measurements performed in Hall A and in the accelerator. The
accuracy of the electron beam energy determination is ∼ 3 × 10−4.

The e+e− coincidence rate was studied for several diﬀerent detector geometries (diﬀer-
ent regions of X planes). In Figure 10, the e+e− coincidence rate is plotted as a function
of the photon energy, as deﬁned in Eq.(4). Data obtained at the PS dipole ﬁeld values
from 1.35T to 1.9T were combined. The shape of the end-point falloﬀ is deﬁned by the
detector resolution. Radiative eﬀects do not play a signiﬁcant role at these energies [7].
The deviations from the lowest order bremsstrahlung cross section at photon energies
∼ 0.999E0 is estimated to be < 10%. The energy value corresponding to the mid point
of the falling edge, EB = 3.784 GeV, was taken as the end-point energy. The accuracy of
this approximation was estimated to be of the order of 5 × 10−4, using the results from
studies with diﬀerent detector acceptances and taking into account the 10% eﬀect from
radiative corrections. A scale factor η = E0/EB = 0.9985 was found as a correction to

6. Final corrections

The ﬁnal tagger energy corrections were computed using the Ci constants for each
E-bin and the energy scale correction factor η. In Figure 11, the ﬁnal corrections are
plotted as a function of the tagger energy bin. A few outlying points around the E-bins
120 and 440 are due to mis-cablings (which were found in this measurement and were
ﬁxed at a later time). The estimated relative uncertainty of these correction constants
is ±0.1%, and is deﬁned largely by the determination of F (B0). An additional error
in the determination of the absolute energy arises from the determination of the end-
point energy and the knowledge of the electron beam energy, and is ∼ 6 × 10−4 for this
measurement.

In summary, we performed an energy calibration of the Hall B bremsstrahlung photon
tagging system at Jeﬀerson Lab. The calibration was done using the Hall B pair spectrom-
eter, instrumented with micro-strip detectors for high precision position measurements.
The calibration results were checked using exclusive photoproduction reactions detected
in CLAS. A result of such an analysis is presented in Fig. 12. The exclusive reaction

energy analysis. In the ﬁgure, the diﬀerence of the missing mass of (pπ+π−) and the
nominal mass of the neutron from the Particle Data Group (PDG) [8] is plotted as a
function of tagger E-bin. The open symbols correspond to the missing mass obtained
without tagger energy corrections, and the ﬁlled symbols correspond to results when the
tagger energy corrections were applied. The variation of the neutron missing mass with-
out the corrections are up to 15 MeV, while with corrections these variations are within
±3 MeV.

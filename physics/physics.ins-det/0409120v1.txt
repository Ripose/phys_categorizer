Abstract

A pixel detector with a CVD diamond sensor has been studied in a 180 GeV/c
pion beam. The charge collection properties of the diamond sensor were studied
as a function of the track position, which was measured with a silicon microstrip
telescope. Non-uniformities were observed on a length scale comparable to the di-
amond crystallites size. In some regions of the sensor, the charge drift appears to
have a component parallel to the sensor surface (i.e., normal to the applied elec-
tric ﬁeld) resulting in systematic residuals between the track position and the hits
position as large as 40 µm. A numerical simulation of the charge drift in polycrys-
talline diamond was developed to compute the signal induced on the electrodes by
the electrons and holes released by the passing particles. The simulation takes into
account the crystallite structure, non-uniform trapping across the sensor, diﬀusion
and polarization eﬀects. It is in qualitative agreement with the data. Additional
lateral electric ﬁeld components result from the non-uniform trapping of charges in
the bulk. These provide a good explanation for the large residuals observed.

1 Introduction

In the last decade the quality of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond
for particle detectors has greatly improved, and the use of this material has
become a potentially attractive option for vertex detectors at high luminosity
colliders (such as the LHC after the proposed luminosity upgrade [1]) promis-
ing to provide the radiation resistance needed for the challenging particle ﬂuxes
expected.

Diamond detectors are believed to be more radiation-hard than silicon [2,3,4].
Even after radiation exposures in excess of 1015 hadrons/cm2 they can be
operated at room temperature without signiﬁcant leakage current. A loss in
the charge signal of about 40% was observed with pion/proton radiation of
[2,3] . With neutrons a loss of 30% was observed at a ﬂuence

The charge collection distance is the ﬁgure of merit for diamond particle detec-
tors. It is deﬁned as dQ/Q0 where d is the diamond ﬁlm thickness, and Q/Q0
is the collection eﬃciency of the ionization charge. The collection distance has
been increased from a few micrometers in the beginning of diamond R&D to
about 250 µm, corresponding to a mean signal of 9000 electrons, today [5].

The charge collection distance depends on the presence of charge carrier
traps [6]. Once a deep level trap has captured a charge carrier the trap can
be permanently passivated. As a consequence of this process, CVD diamond
shows a signiﬁcant increase in the charge collection distance after being ex-
posed to ﬂuences of the order of 106 minimum ionizing particles per mm2, a
process called pumping or priming. CVD diamond remains for a long period
(months) in the primed state if kept in the dark and at room temperature.

CVD diamond usually has a polycrystalline structure with an average crys-
tallite size on the growth side of the order of 1/7 of the thickness [3]. On the
substrate side the crystal size is only a few micrometers. The charge collection
distance can be diﬀerent in diﬀerent crystallites [3,7], leading to a non-uniform
response and a broadening of the distribution of the charge signal from the
whole substrate.

In this paper we report test-beam measurements and simulations of diamond
pixel detectors equipped with a prototype electronics chip of the ATLAS Pixel
silicon detector [8,9,10]. In Section 2 the analysis of test-beam data taken with
two diamond pixel detectors is presented. The spatial resolution and detection
eﬃciency of the detectors are reported, and the observation of a non uniform
response of the detectors across the sensor area is discussed. In Section 4 a

numerical simulation of the charge collection processes inside the diamond
sensor and of the detector response is presented. It is shown that the non
uniform response can be reproduced as a consequence of the polarization ﬁelds
created by the charge trapped in the crystallite structure.

2 Test beam Set-up and tested devices

2.1 The test beam set-up

Test beam experiments were performed at the CERN SPS accelerator during
the years 2000 and 2001 with a pion beam of 180 GeV/c momentum.

A beam telescope consisting of 4 silicon microstrip modules was used to mea-
sure the transverse position of the incident beam particles. In the setup used
in the year 2000 [11] each module consisted of a pair of microstrip detectors,
each providing one coordinate. In the setup used in 2001 each module con-
sisted of a double-sided microstrip detector. The new telescope used a readout
architecture including zero suppression [12], which oﬀered higher trigger rate
capability. For both set-ups, the position resolution of tracks projected onto
the tested devices was about 6 µm.

2.2 The diamond sensors

Two diamond sensors, identiﬁed by UTS-5 and CD91, were tested in the
beam [13]. The sensors were grown to a thickness of about 800 µm. The
grain size on the growth side is of the order of 100 µm. The sensors were then
lapped on the substrate side by about 300 µm and on the growth side by
about 50 µm so that the ﬁnal thickness is 432 µm for UTS-5 and 470 µm for
CD91. The lateral dimensions of the sensors were 8 mm

8mm.

×

400 µm
The electrode on the growth side was segmented in pixels of 50 µm
dimensions. Each pixel was electrically connected via electroplated PbSn sol-
der bumps to a matching readout electronics cell in the front-end chip.

×

In the following, x is the coordinate along the short (50 µm) dimension of the
pixels, y is the coordinate along the long (400 µm) dimension of the pixels,
and z is the coordinate perpendicular to the pixel plane.

Before operation at the test beam, data were taken with a 241Am and a 90Sr
source, with activities of 74 MBq and 62 kBq respectively. The sources were
kept for 12 h at about 5 mm from the diamond sensor. The β source delivered

3

a ﬂuence of the order of 107 mm−2 (0.3 Gy dose) to each sensor, which is
enough to bring good quality diamond in the primed state [7]. This conclusions
is supported by the test beam data, discussed below, since the average signal
and the detection eﬃciency did not show any time dependence during the data
taking.

2.3 Front-end electronics

The electronics chips were produced during the development phase of the
ATLAS Pixel front-end electronics program [8,9,10]. Their design was simi-
lar to that of the ﬁnal front-end electronics for ATLAS Pixel [14,15]. In each
front-end chip, 2880 channels are arranged into 18 columns by 160 rows. The
charge-sensitive preampliﬁers feature a DC feedback scheme with a tunable
current providing control over the shaping-time for a given input charge. A
discrimination stage sits behind the preampliﬁer in each channel which is
sensitive to the leading edges and the trailing edges of pulses. Each channel
is equipped with its own 3-bit DAC for channel-to-channel threshold adjust-
ments, thus a means of overall dispersion reduction is provided. The chips have
a 7-bit charge measurement capability using the time-over-threshold (ToT) of
the signal. The ToT is calibrated by injecting a known charge into every chan-
nel. A 2880-bit pixel register plus one corresponding latch per channel enable
individual pixels to be masked-oﬀ independently for calibration-strobing and
readout.

The chip is operated at the 40 MHz LHC bunch crossing rate and the times
are measured in multiples of the 25 ns clock period. Only pixel signals whose
leading edge belongs to the period speciﬁed by an external trigger are read
out. At the test-beam the trigger was provided by two scintillator detectors
and 16 consecutive 25 ns time windows were accepted.

During the operation in the test beam the thresholds of the individual channels
were adjusted achieving a threshold dispersion of less than 100 e. A typical
threshold setting was 1000 e while the average noise per pixel was about 200 e.

3 Analysis of test beam data

Events were ﬁltered with the requirement of one and only one track recon-
structed by the silicon microstrip telescope in each event. Only events with a
track reconstruction χ2 probability greater than 0.02 were kept. Tracks were
required to extrapolate into a ﬁducial area. For CD91 this was the surface
covered by the pixel array, excluding the region within 40 µm of the border.

For UTS-5 it was the smaller area with a good bump-bonding yield [13].

±

±

Pixel clusters were built clustering together all adjacent pixels, independently
of track extrapolations. The cluster charge is deﬁned as the sum of the charges
measured by the pixels of the cluster. This can be less than the total collected
charge, since it does not include the pixel signals below the electronics thresh-
old. The cluster position is computed as the arithmetic mean of the coordinates
of the pixels in the cluster.

The data discussed here have been taken at normal incidence. The sensors
were operated with a bias voltage of 450 V (UTS-5) or 470 V (CD91).

At normal incidence, most clusters are composed of one or two pixels. The
average cluster size was measured to be 1.260
0.001 pixels for CD91 and
1.484

0.010 for UTS-5.

Charge calibrations were available only for UTS-5, for which the cluster charge
(the sum of the charges measured by the pixels of the cluster) was (3000

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the x residuals between the track position as
determined by the telescope and the pixel cluster position. For comparison,
the same distribution is reported for an ATLAS Pixel silicon sensor, with a
similar pixel geometry, bump-bonded to a similar electronics chip and tested
with the same test-beam setup. The r.m.s. of spatial residual distributions 2

algorithms for the position of multi-pixel clusters improves these values only
by a few tenths of a micrometer. The values of mean cluster size, detection
eﬃciency and spatial resolution are summarized in table 1.

The reasons for the poor diamond resolution were investigated by looking at
the mean x residuals 3 as a function of the track position on the sensor. The
sensor was divided in bins of 50 µm
50 µm size, and for each bin i the mean
spatial x residual ri has been computed. The same analysis was also performed
on a ATLAS Pixel silicon detector with similar sensor geometry, electronics
and test beam setup. The results are reported in Fig. 2 4 .

3 The silicon microstrip telescope provides comparable resolutions on the x and
y coordinates of the track extrapolation. The pixel cluster position, in contrast, is
determined with far better precision in the x direction, because of the 8:1 aspect
ratio of ATLAS Pixels. For this reason, the y residuals have not been taken into
consideration.

The silicon sensor (upper plot) shows a more uniform distribution. Bins with
large residuals are isolated and scattered across the sensor as one expects from
statistical ﬂuctuations. The diamond sensors (middle and lower plot) present
regions which have systematically positive or negative residuals as large as
40 µm. No correlation is observed between these regions and the segmentation
in pixels. The scale of the residual clustering is of the order of 100 µm which
is also the typical size of the diamond crystallites. This suggests that in some
crystallites the drift of the charge carriers has a component parallel to the
sensor surface, so that the average position of the pixel clusters is shifted
away from the track position.

The statistical error δri on each mean residual ri is σ/√ni where σ is the spatial
resolution and ni is the number of events inside the position bin. The weighted
r.m.s of mean residuals is R = qΣi(ri/δri)2/Σi1/δr2

In absence of systematic eﬀects on the spatial response of the detector one
expects the r.m.s. of mean residuals R to be Rstat = σ/√N where N is
the average number of entries for each position bin. For silicon it is Rstat =
0.04) µm which is indeed close to the measured value. For diamond
(6.27
an important systematic contribution exists, since the measured values of R
are much larger than the values expected from statistic ﬂuctuations, Rstat =

To quantify the apparent clustering of residual shifts, the linear correlation
coeﬃcient between the residuals of all track pairs has been determined. Since
each event which passes selection cuts has only one reconstructed track, the
pairs are formed considering the tracks of two diﬀerent events. Correlation
coeﬃcients are determined in bins of the distance between the two tracks of a
pair. An empirical ﬁt function

has been found to describe the data of the correlation coeﬃcient of residuals as
a function of track separation x. The function is the sum of two components.
A sinusoidal modulation with the periodicity of the pixel pitch describes the
correlation due to the pattern structure of the sensor. A falling exponential

The presence of the exponential peak in the diamond correlation distribution
is evidence of non-homogeneous charge collection properties producing local
systematic shifts in the position response. The investigation of their origin is
the subject of the studies described in the next chapter.

4 Simulation of the diamond sensors

In order to understand the experimental results in terms of the microscopic
properties of charge carriers drift in diamond, a numerical simulation of the
response of diamond sensors to ionizing radiation has been developed.

4.1 The model

The interactions of high-energy pions with the diamond sensor have been sim-
ulated using the GEANT4 package [17]. This step of the simulation produces
a ﬁle with a list of the energy deposits of the particles inside diamond (hits).
The energy of each hit is converted into a number of electron-hole pairs using
the conversion factor of one pair for 13.1 eV of deposited energy. The charge
carriers are then drifted in the diamond in steps of l = 5 µm until they are
trapped or they are collected at the electrodes.

Drift model: The drift direction is determined by the local electric ﬁeld and
thermal diﬀusion. The local electric ﬁeld is the superposition of the external
ﬁeld of 1040 V/mm and the polarization ﬁeld created by the charge carriers
trapped in the sensor. The diﬀusion function is a Gaussian with σ = √2Dt,
where D is the diﬀusivity and t the drift time. The diﬀusivity D is related
to the low-ﬁeld mobility µ0 and the temperature T by the Einstein relation
D = µ0kT /e, where k is the Boltzmann constant and e the elementary charge.

The drift time corresponding to one drift step is t = l/v where the drift velocity
v depends on the electric ﬁeld. It is proportional to the electric ﬁeld for low
ﬁeld intensity, and reaches saturation in the high-ﬁeld limit. The following

where µ0 is the low-ﬁeld drift mobility and vs is the high-ﬁeld saturation

Diamond grains generator: The trapping model presented below requires
the simulation of the grain structure of CVD diamond. The grains growth
generator is a generalization to three dimensions of the generator described
5 µm3) and the grains are
in [7]. The space is divided in small cubic cells (5
initially 2 x 2 cells wide. Every time that a layer of cells is added to the diamond
ﬁlm, each cell near the grain border has a probability p to be claimed by a
neighboring grain. The resulting conﬂicts between grains claiming the same
space element are solved assigning to each grain a probability to defeat the
other proportional to the grain width. This results in large grains getting larger
and small grains getting smaller and ﬁnally being overgrown. The resulting
simulated structure is shown in Fig. 5.

×

×

5

The only parameters of the model are the growth probability p and the ﬁlm
thickness, which is the sensor thickness plus the material removed from the
substrate side. The ﬁlm thickness (732 µm) is equal to the ﬁnal sensor thickness
plus the thickness of material removed from the substrate side. The growth
probability is chosen so that the resulting spatial residuals correlation length
(see Sec. 4.2) agrees with the data.

Trapping model: The probability for a charge carrier to be trapped within
the drift step l is 1

l/vτ ) where v is the velocity and τ the lifetime.

exp(

−

−

The lifetime is inversely proportional to the local density of active traps. Dif-
ferent initial trap density distributions have been implemented. In the simu-
lation presented in this paper, the initial trap density depends on the shortest
distance to the next grain boundary and is described by [7]

n = n0/[1

exp(

r/r0)]

−

−

(3)

with r the distance to the next grain boundary, n0 the minimum trap density
(deep in the grains bulk) and r0 the lifetime length. The trap density becomes
very high near the grain boundaries. This model is supported by observa-
tions that the impurity concentration is strongly enhanced at grain bound-
aries [22,23] thus resulting in a larger density of electrically active traps [7,24].

8

Priming is simulated by implementing two classes of traps [7]. After they
capture a charge, the traps of one class can act as recombination centers,
while the traps of the other class are permanently passivated. The electron
and hole lifetimes are computed as

τe = 1/βe(n0 + n+)

τh = 1/βh(n0 + n−)

(4)

(5)

n0 is the density of unﬁlled traps of both classes, n+(n−) is the density of
recombination centers ﬁlled with holes (electrons). β can be interpreted as the
product of the charge carriers thermal velocity and an eﬀective trapping cross
section. It is the same for traps of the two classes but diﬀerent values can be
set for electrons and holes.

When a charged carrier is trapped, the local density of ﬁlled and unﬁlled
traps and the local trapped charge density are updated. The polarization ﬁeld
created by the trapped charges is periodically updated and superimposed to
the external ﬁeld to get the electric ﬁeld map.

As the diamond sensor is exposed to ionizing radiation, three dose-dependent
eﬀects occur:

•

•

•

The pure trapping centers are passivated, so that the eﬀective trap density
is reduced, simulating the priming eﬀect.
Near the electrodes the charge carrier which is drifting toward the electrode
is dominant (electrons near the pixels electrodes, holes on the other side).
Thus a net space charge density develops. The resulting polarization screens
the external ﬁeld.
A net space charge develops also near the grain boundaries (only in the
scenario with non-uniform trap density). Because of grain lateral growth the
boundary surface makes in general a non-zero angle with the z direction.
Electrons and holes approach this surface from opposite directions, and are
trapped before reaching the interface because of the very high trapping
density. Hence a space charge distribution is created, with opposite signs on
the two sides of the interface. The electric ﬁeld they produce is normal to
the interface, and has a component which is transverse to the external ﬁeld.
This is the source of the charge drift parallel to the sensor surface.

The distribution of trapped charge for a two-dimensional simulation is shown
in Fig. 6. A net negative trapped charge develops near the pixels at the bottom
and a net positive charge near the other electrode. The tree-like structures are
the boundaries between grains (growing from above). There is a larger trapped
charge there, negative above the boundary and positive below it.

9

The parameters of the trapping model discussed are n0, r0, βe, βh and the frac-
tion α of pure trapping centers as explained above. A constraint on the above
parameters is provided by the measured value of the average collected charge
(3000 e−). This still leaves four degrees of freedom in the parameter choice.
Since the other parameters are related to unmeasured properties (such as the
priming ratio, or the hole/electron lifetime ratio) it is not possible to determine
them from the data.

Some educated guesses have been made instead, with the purpose of building
a model which can qualitatively reproduce the features observed in the data,
in particular the systematic position shifts. The choice of ﬁnal values for the
parameters is reported below.

•

•

•

•

The ratio between hole and electron trapping βh/βe was chosen to be 1.5
since measurements with α particles show that holes have a lower lifetime
than electrons in diamond sensors [25].
The fraction α of traps which are permanently passivated upon capture
of a charge carrier aﬀects primarily the priming ratio (the ratio between
the signals observed in the primed and unprimed state). The value α =
0.85 was used. The resulting priming ratio is 1.6 (it is also aﬀected by n0,
discussed below). The priming ratio of the sensor studied at the test beam
is not known, but the simulated value is typical for sensors with good charge
collection eﬃciency [23]. The simulated priming curve is shown in Fig. 7.
The extent of the region near the crystallite boundaries where trapping is
enhanced is determined by r0. The value r = 25 µm was chosen. This is
smaller than the crystallite size so that in the crystallite bulk the charge
lifetime is indeed larger than near the border. A lower value does not change
qualitatively the results presented in the next section, but would make them
more sensitive to the cell length l of the grid of points on which the trap
densities are computed.
The total trap concentration n0 at the center of crystallites. The value n0 =
2.5 µm−3 has been used. A smaller value results in a weaker polarization
ﬁeld and thus in a smaller lateral component of the charge drift, in contrast
with the experimental evidence. A larger trap density results in too eﬀective
external ﬁeld screening, making it diﬃcult to reproduce a typical priming
curve (the signal reaches a maximum then decreases with dose).

The sensitivity of the results of the simulation on each parameter has been
computed varying one parameter at a time and retuning β (keeping constant
βe/βh) so that the mean signal was always equal the experimental value. The
resulting variations of eﬃciency, resolution and systematic shift r.m.s. R are
reported in table 2.

Signal formation: At the end of the charge drift algorithm, a list of the posi-
tions where the electrons and holes have been trapped or collected is produced.

The charge Q induced on a given pixel electrode is computed as

−

(6)

where qi are the drifting electric charges, ~ri is the position at which they
were trapped or collected, ~r0 their initial positions, and Φw is the weighting
potential [26,27] for the pixel electrode under consideration.

The experimental electronics threshold and noise (1000 e− and 200 e− r.m.s.)
are simulated.

The pixel hits are processed with the same algorithms used for the analysis
of real data. To simulate the telescope extrapolation uncertainty of 6 µm a
Gaussian smearing is added to the true track position.

Due to the severe CPU and memory requirements of a 3D simulation, only a
0.45 mm3 volume was simulated. Trap density maps and charge drift

were made with a discretization of space in 5 µm steps while the computation
of the polarization ﬁeld was made with a grid with 20 µm pitch.

The diamond samples were in a primed state when data were collected. This
was simulated with a suﬃciently large number of traversing charged particles
to reach a primed state before events for analysis were processed.

The simulated mean spatial residuals as a function of track position are shown
in the lower plot of Fig. 8. For comparison, the upper plot reports the results
obtained with a uniform trap density (i.e., without simulating the crystallites
structure).

The simulation with trapping enhanced near the crystallites boundaries shows
systematic shifts as large as 30 µm in the position of the collected charge, as
observed with the data (Fig. 2). The agreement with experimental results is
much better than using the simulation with uniform trapping 5 .

The same conclusion holds for the residual correlation plot (Fig. 9). In the
simulation with uniform trapping (square points) only the readout pitch cor-
relation is observed, and a good ﬁt is obtained omitting the exponential term

5 The simulation with uniform trapping has an r.m.s. of mean residuals which is
even smaller than the value measured with the data of the silicon sensor. This is
due to the fact that the average number of events per bin is larger in the simulation,
so statistical ﬂuctuations are smaller.

of eq. 1, as with the experimental silicon data. For the simulation with non-
uniform trapping, however, the correlation at small distance scales seen in the
diamond data (Fig.4) is reproduced. The simulated residual correlation plot
has been ﬁtted with eq. 1.

The correlation length is determined by the average crystallite size, determined
by the growth parameter p, and by the trapping parameters, especially the
spatial scale for trapping non-uniformities r0. The correlation length was tuned
to the experimentally measured value by varying p while keeping the trapping
parameters constant, except for an overall lifetime scaling to get an average
signal equal to the measured value. As p is increased the average crystal size 6
at the growth surface increases from 0.0119 mm2 to 0.0422 mm2 and the
correlation length increases from (21.7

In table 3 the values of the spatial resolution, the r.m.s. of systematic shifts
R (computed as in section 3), the detection eﬃciency and the residuals cor-
relation length are reported for the two simulations and test-beam data. The
statistic error is quoted for simulated values.

The systematic shifts are absent in the simulation without the crystallite struc-
ture since they are produced by the lateral component of the polarization ﬁeld
created by charges trapped near the crystallite boundaries. The simulation of
the polycrystalline structure is also needed to reproduce the experimental ob-
served detection eﬃciency of about 70%. When it is omitted the eﬃciency
(respecting the experimental constraints on the average cluster charge and
discriminator threshold) is almost 100%. The simulation of the crystallites
results in a non-uniform charge collection and regions with reduced detection
eﬃciency. This reproduces the experimentally observed detection eﬃciency to
reasonable accuracy.

While the simulation with enhanced trapping near the grain borders is able
to qualitatively reproduce the lateral displacement of charge collection and
the residuals correlation at small distance scales observed in the data, these
polarization eﬀects are less pronounced in the simulation. As a result, the
amplitude and the r.m.s. of systematic shifts R are smaller and the spatial
resolution is better in the simulation than in the data.

It is possible to increase the strength of polarization eﬀects with a diﬀerent
choice of the model parameters. In particular, a larger value for n0 increases the
density of traps and thus the polarization charges. However, this also makes

the screening of the external electric ﬁeld more eﬀective, and it is no longer
possible to obtain a priming curve with a ﬂat plateau (Fig. 7), instead the
signal reaches a maximum and then decreases, as the ﬁeld screening prevails
over the passivation eﬀect. We have restricted ourselves to choices of the model
parameters which give a priming curve typical for diamond sensors exposed
to minimum ionizing particles.

Most likely, to achieve a quantitative agreement with the data requires a more
accurate trapping model. In the model described in Section 4.1 only two classes
of traps have been implemented, pure trapping centres with cross sections σe
and σh for electrons and holes respectively and trapping/recombination centres
with the same cross sections σe and σh both for trapping and recombination
processes. In general, several classes of trapping centres should be anticipated,
each one with four diﬀerent cross sections for electron trapping, hole trapping,
electron recombination and hole recombination, respectively. In order not to
spoil the predictive power of the model by a too large number of free param-
eters we refrained from introducing these parameters. A detailed microscopic
characterization of the number, spatial distribution and trapping cross sections
of defect centres in the diamond sensor would be required to better assess the
role of these trapping centres and include them in the simulation. That is,
however, beyond the scope of the study presented in this paper.

5 Conclusions

Test-beam data were taken with diamond pixel detectors. A detection eﬃ-
ciency of about 70% and a spatial resolution of about 20 µm were obtained.
The ﬁne segmentation provided by the pixels and the tracking of the particles
by a silicon microstrip telescope allowed a study of the spatial resolution of
the detector as a function of the incident position of the particles.

The spatial resolution was found to be degraded by the presence of regions
where the reconstructed impact position given by the pixel cluster and the
true track position measured with a beam telescope deviate systematically.
These regions have the same dimension of the diamond crystallites (about
100 µm) hence they appear to be related to the polycrystalline nature of the
sensor.

A model was proposed which attributes the charge collection position shifts to
the polarization ﬁeld created by charges trapped near the crystallite borders,
which can have a component parallel to the sensor surface.

A simulation was presented which implements a detailed description of the
ionizing particle interactions, the drift and the trapping of charge carriers in

13

diamond, polarization eﬀects and signal induction on the electrodes. A model
for CVD diamond growth was deployed to simulate the crystallite shape in
three dimensions, together with a model for the trap density distribution in
crystallites.

The simulation is able to reproduce at least qualitatively the lateral displace-
ment of charge collection and the residuals correlation at small distance scales
observed in the data, albeit the eﬀect is weaker in the simulation. Detection
eﬃciency for the same amount of collected charge is also reproduced. With a
uniform trap density neither the charge collection displacements and residuals
correlation nor the detection eﬃciency can be reproduced.

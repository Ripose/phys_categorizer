Abstract

A major advance in accurate electron beam polarization measurement has been

achieved at Jlab Hall A with a Compton polarimeter based on a Fabry-Perot cavity

photon beam ampliﬁer. At an electron energy of 4.6 GeV and a beam current of

40 µA, a total relative uncertainty of 1.5% is typically achieved within 40 min of

data taking. Under the same conditions monitoring of the polarization is accurate at

a level of 1%. These unprecedented results make Compton polarimetry an essential

tool for modern parity-violation experiments, which require very accurate electron

beam polarization measurements.

1 Introduction

The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at the Jeﬀerson

Laboratory(JLab) is a new particle accelerator which makes extensive use of

its highly polarized electron beam for the study of nucleons and nuclei. The

polarization is measured at the injector with a 5 MeV Mott polarimeter and in

the Hall A beam line with a Møller polarimeter and a Compton polarimeter.

Mott and Møller polarimeters require solid targets and operate respectively at

low energy and at low intensity (

1µA). Because of its thin photon target,

only Compton backscattering polarimetry provides an essential tool for accu-

rate measurement and monitoring of the beam polarization under the same

conditions as the running experiment. However, the mean Compton analyzing

power (Ac) depends strongly on the beam energy - Ac ≈

typical beam conditions provided by CEBAF, an energy of several GeV and

a beam intensity up to 100 µA, require a high laser power to provide the

required interaction luminosity. The design of the Compton polarimeter was

challenging [1,2]. The photon density is ampliﬁed with a Fabry-Perot cavity of

very high ﬁnesse which provides a power of 1700 W of IR light at the Comp-

ton interaction point. This performance, unequalled in a particle accelerator

environment, results in a statistical accuracy for a polarization measurement

below 1% within an hour at 4.6 GeV [3]. This number scales with the inverse

of the beam energy.

In section 2 of this paper, we brieﬂy summarize the experimental set-up of the

Compton polarimeter. Section refsec:datatake describes its operational prop-

erties achieved during two polarized experiments, N

∆ [4,5] and GEp [6,7].

Next, we describe a new analysis method developed to restrain systematic un-

certainties in the polarization measurement with a high conﬁdence level. We

explain in detail the sources of these systematic errors and present longitu-

dinal electron polarization measurement results. Finally, we give for the ﬁrst

time at JLab a measurement of the polarization diﬀerence between the two

helicity states of the electron beam.

beam shows an asymmetry of the counting rates n+/− for diﬀerent orientations

where the asymmetry Ac is calculated from QED. Measurements of the ex-

perimental asymmetry Aexp and of the circular photon polarization Pγ give

access to the mean longitudinal electron polarization Pe. The electron beam

polarization is ﬂipped at a 30 Hz rate to minimize systematic eﬀects.

The Compton polarimeter is composed of a magnetic chicane of four identical

dipoles connected in series and installed in the Hall A beam line. The Comp-

ton interaction takes place at the center of a symmetric Fabry-Perot cavity

in which photons, originating from a 230 mW IR laser (λ = 1064 nm) inter-

fere. The laser frequency is locked to one of the resonant frequencies of the

cavity using the Pound-Drever feedback technique [9]. The maximum power

inside the cavity reaches 1700 W, with a coupling to the fundamental mode

of 92%. The detectors are installed between the third and the fourth dipoles

of the chicane. The backscattered photons go through the gap of the third

magnet in a calorimeter consisting of 25 P bW O4 crystals (2x2x23cm3) and

the scattered electrons are detected in 4 planes of 48 silicon strips (650 µm

wide), segmented along the dispersive axis. The data acquisition can be trig-

gered by either electrons, photons, or both (in coincidence). Typical running

conditions at CEBAF during data taking in 2000 were an electron energy of

E=4.6 GeV and a beam current of Ie = 40µA. The Compton backscattered

photons energy range is from 0 to 340 MeV under these conditions.

3 Data Taking

We describe here how the Compton polarimeter data-acquisition system works,

and the strategy used to minimize false asymmetries.

4

3.1 Acquisition

The data acquisition is driven by the 30 Hz electron beam polarization ﬂip.

Two milliseconds after each reversal, the trigger system is activated and events

are taken from the photon and/or electron detectors, according to the trigger

conﬁguration determined by the user. The trigger system is inhibited a few

ms before the next reversal.

Each detector has its own trigger logic. The photon calorimeter trigger system

generates an event when the signal of one the photo-multiplier tubes exceeds

a given threshold. This signal is then integrated over a period of 150 ns. The

electron detector triggers when signals are detected in coincidence on a given

number of the silicon strip planes, at the same dispersive position. A speciﬁc

logic is used to take care of cases where both detectors ﬁre in coincidence.

The data-acquisition system can read out photon and electron events at a rate

greater than 100 kHz with a dead time of only a few percent. These data are

read by either a custom-built buﬀer card for the electron detector signals, or

10 bits buﬀered ADCs for the photon calorimeter. Calibration signals from a

LED can be used to monitor the gain variation of the photon detector.

All these raw data are read through VME block transfer by two Power PC

CPU cards working alternatively at each electron polarization reversal. At the

end of each polarization period, the CPU card that has read out the data, reads

values from scaler cards which provide summary information of that period

(counting rates, number of triggers, dead time, average value of electron and

photon beams parameters, etc. . . ). This CPU then transfers control of the

VME crate to the other CPU, produces on-line calculations and sends a data

block to a workstation where these data are stored. The goal of these on-

5

line calculations is to reduce the huge amount of data coming from both

detectors by producing computed values and histograms (in particular the

energy spectra of the scattered photons). Only a small fraction of the raw

data, controlled by prescaler factors, is kept for monitoring purposes. Thus,

the data block stored at the end of each electron polarization state consists of

the scalers summary values, the result of the on-line calculations (computed

values and histogram), and pre-scaled photon, electron and coincidence raw

data.

3.2 Photon polarization reversal

Helicity-correlated diﬀerences in the electron beam parameters (charge, posi-

tion and angle) lead to false asymmetries bi which add to the experimental

asymmetry

Aexp = PePγAc +

bi

where i runs over the diﬀerent sources of false asymmetries. The charge asym-

metry is corrected to ﬁrst order by normalizing the counting rates to the beam

current. The remaining systematic eﬀects from position and angle are inde-

pendent of the photon beam polarization state. Hence, in changing the sign

of the photon polarization the major part of this type of false asymmetries

is canceled. This deﬁnes the procedure for data taking as a sequence of al-

ternating right and left laser circular polarization, as illustrated in ﬁgure 1.

Moreover, between two photon polarization states, the cavity is unlocked in

order to measure the background. Thanks to a high quality vacuum in the

beam pipe and the control of the beam envelope using quadrupoles upstream

not to the maximum amplitude reached by the signal. It can be varied oﬀ line

in order to obtain the optimal value that maximizes the statistical accuracy

and minimizes the eﬀect of false asymmetries. This operating point is found to

be between the 6th and the 9th bin (see section 6). For a typical 40 minutes

run, a raw asymmetry AR/L

accuracy of 0.65% in one hour at I = 40µA.

5 Analysing power

The second part of this analysis concerns the determination of the analyzing

power. In order to account for detection eﬀects, we deﬁne the response function

of the calorimeter

(ADC, k) as the ADC spectrum for a set of photons with a

given energy k. From this response function the probability to detect photons

of energy k above a given ADC threshold ADCs is

The calorimeter response function depends mostly on the intrinsic properties

of the calorimeter. It is measured during dedicated runs where data are taken

in photon-electron coincidence mode on an event-by-event basis.

Thanks to its very ﬁne pitch the electron detector functions as an energy tagger

of the incident photons. The distribution of the photon energy deposited in

the central crystal for one selected strip of the electron detector is shown in

ﬁgure 4. The tail at low energy is due to shower leakage to the sides of the

central crystal (the Moli`ere radius is 2.19 cm). For practical reasons it was

found more accurate to model the response function of the central crystal

rather than dealing with the inter-calibration of all the crystals of the 5x5

matrix [10]. The response function is described by an ad hoc asymmetrical

function composed of two Gaussians and a 4th degree polynomial P4(x). Best

where A, ADC0 and σR/L are Gaussian parameters, and η, δ denote propor-

by normalizing the integral of the response function to 1 in the denomina-

9

tor of Eq.(7). The remaining ﬁve parameters are functions of the scattered

photon energy k, ﬁtted to data from all electron detector strips which ﬁred.

The Gaussian widths σR/L are corrected for smearing due to the width of the

electron strips (σE ≈

5 MeV).

and thus restricts the range over which the response function can be deter-

mined. For instance, only photon energies between 150 MeV and 340 MeV

(Compton edge) could be explored with a 4.6 GeV beam. The determination

of the calorimeter response function is well controlled inside this energy range

but the extrapolation to lower energy induces larger systematic errors (see

section 6).

5.2 Calibration and analyzing power

The response function measured during a speciﬁc reference run has to be

corrected for mean gain variations when used to analyze a later run. To this

end a calibration coeﬃcient λ is introduced which accounts for gain corrections

(ADC, k) =

The probability of photon detection is deduced from Eq.(7), where the lower

integration boundary ADCs is replaced by ADCs/λ. The analyzing power is

then calculated from Eq.(8) for each data run (with is = 8). An overview

is given in ﬁgure 6 and shows relative variations of up to 10%. Most of the

observed steps in the analyzing power originate from a retuning of the photon

detection gain (PMT high voltage or gain of the ampliﬁer). Reference runs are

repeated every few hours to check the consistency of the extracted response

function.

6 Systematic uncertainties

6.1 Experimental asymmetry

The largest source of systematic error in the experimental asymmetry is the

false asymmetry related to the electron beam position, since the Compton

luminosity is determined by the overlap of the electron and laser beams. If

one assumes a Gaussian intensity proﬁle for these two beams, the luminosity is

also a Gaussian function of the distance between the two beam centroids. Since

the optical axis of the cavity is ﬁxed by the monolithic mechanic of the mirror

holder, the position variation of the electron beam directly aﬀects the Compton

luminosity with a sensitivity equal to the derivative of this Gaussian function.

In order to minimize this eﬀect, two position-feedback systems were used, one

at high frequency to reduce the jitter (down to 20 µm) and one at low frequency

to lock the mean position at the point corresponding to the maximum of the

Gaussian overlap curve, where the sensitivity to beam position goes to zero.

Finally, averaging over several photon polarization reversals cancels out most

11

of these false asymmetries provided that the statistical weights of right and left

circularly photon polarization states are similar. In practice, these statistical

weights ωR/L are not exactly equal, and some residual eﬀects must be taken

into account. So, in agreement with equations (2) and (6), we have:

∆Asyst

expi = res(bi) =

ωLbL

ωRbR
i

i −
ωL + ωR

(12)

Studies of the four beam parameters (x, y, θx, θy) show that their correlations

tend to reduce the total false asymmetry. As a safe and simpler estimate

of the error we assume them to be uncorrelated. The ﬁnal error quoted in

Table 1 should be read as a typical run-to-run error. It corresponds to the

width of the distribution of all res(bi) which turns out to be centered at

zero. For each individual run one can also choose to correct for res(bi) and

its error. When averaging the polarization over a suﬃcient number of runs

Nr the two approaches are equivalent and the systematic error reduces as

1/√Nr. The measured background has a small rate and asymmetry, compared

to the Compton process, resulting in a negligible systematic error. Similarly

the beam current asymmetry is at the few 100 ppm level and does not aﬀect

signiﬁcantly the Compton asymmetry. The correction for the acquisition dead

time is checked by comparing the scaler asymmetry and the corrected ADC

asymmetry without applying a software threshold.

6.2 Analyzing power

There are four main sources of uncertainties in the analyzing power. The ﬁrst

comes from the dependence of the response function on the parameterization

used to describe it. To compute the systematic error we look at the variation of

12

the analyzing power for a set of parameterizations with equivalent χ2 and try

to deﬁne an envelope (ﬁg. 7). For a threshold taken around ADC = 400 (is = 8,

E = 230 MeV) the eﬀect is less than 0.45%. Note that below the electron cut,

located around channel 260 on ﬁg. 7, the systematic errors increase steeply.

The second source of uncertainty arises from the momentum calibration of the

electron detector which is used as an energy tagger in the determination of the

response function (section 5.1). This calibration error is due to the position

resolution of the electron detector (200 µm). The impact of this eﬀect on the

analyzing power is shown in ﬁgure 8 as a function of the ADC threshold. For

a threshold taken at ADC = 400 the eﬀect is 0.6 %. The third uncertainty

is due to pile-up when two events are detected within the same acquisition

gate (

150 ns) and are recorded as a single event of higher energy. The

∼

Compton spectrum is then shifted to higher energies. This modiﬁes not only

the experimental asymmetry but also the analyzing power via the calibration

coeﬃcient λ. Monte-Carlo simulations [11] were performed for a measured pile-

up rate of 0.9%. They show a relative eﬀect of 0.45% for an ADC threshold

is = 8. The fourth systematic uncertainty is due to the radiative corrections

in real Compton scattering. The interfering process e−γ

e−γγ causes a

→

deviation of the analyzing power by about 0.26% [12] at an electron beam

energy of 4.6 GeV. We decided not to correct for this eﬀect and include it in the

error budget. Systematic uncertainties on the analyzing power are summarized

in Table 2.

13

6.3 Photon polarization

The circular photon polarization is measured at the exit of the Fabry-Perot

cavity using an analysis device composed of a quarter-wave plate, a Wollaston

prism and two integrating spheres. This device allows a complete polarization

measurement through the four Stokes parameters by rotating the quarter-

wave plate. In production mode the quarter-wave plate angle is ﬁxed and the

spheres only monitor the time variations of the degree of circular polarization

(DOCP). The polarization at the center of the cavity where the Compton

interaction takes places is deduced from the Stokes parameters, knowing the

optical transport matrix of the exit line. This matrix is determined before the

installation of the cavity using a dedicated setup where polarization measure-

ments are performed for various orientations of the elliptic polarization of the

light. With this method a precision of 0.4 % is reached including both the

modelisation of the transport and the measurement errors. After the cavity

is installed, additional eﬀects coming from mirror transmission, birefringence

and optical alignment of photon beam must be taken into account. Since in

production mode only the DOCP is measured, we use the observed variations

and the transport matrix to determine the envelope of possible variations of

the polarization inside the cavity. This results in a 0.4 % systematic error. All

uncertainties are summarized in Table 3 The mean value of the DOCP for

both laser polarization states is :

7 Results and discussions

7.1 General results

A review of the uncertainties is given in Table 4. The last column shows the

accuracy of the monitoring of the electron beam polarization for which all nor-

malization errors cancel. A summary graph of all polarization measurements

performed during the N-∆ experiment is shown in ﬁgure 9 (300 measurements

in 60 days). The jumps in the beam polarization are directly correlated with

operations at the polarized electron source when the laser spot is displaced to

illuminate a diﬀerent spot on the photocathode in order to increase the beam

current. These signiﬁcant variations in the beam polarization demonstrate

that the Compton polarimeter is an ideal and a mandatory tool to provide a

meaningful polarization measurement over long data-taking periods.

Most of the polarized physics experiments in Hall A are only sensitive to the

mean longitudinal electron polarization deﬁned as

where P +

e and P −

ﬁguration (parallel or anti-parallel). However, some experiments, such as the

(16)

One way to measure this quantity is to use the photon polarization reversal,

sacriﬁcing the cancellation of helicity-correlated eﬀects. Experimental asym-

metries are thus computed from counting rates between two opposite signs of

the photon polarization, for each electron helicity [11]. However, the photon

polarization is reversed every three minutes only, resulting in a false asym-

metry of the same size as the Compton asymmetry itself. If one makes the

assumption that these false asymmetries are independent of the backscattered

photon’s energy, variation of the Compton asymmetry with respect to energy

allows one to isolate ∆Pe. An example is shown in ﬁgure 10 where the sum of
exp and A−

both experimental asymmetries A+

exp is ﬁtted with a function such

as

f (E) = ∆Pe ·

Pγ ·

AC(E) + cst.

(17)

For a set of Left/Right photon reversals over several days, we assess ∆Pe for

the ﬁrst time at JLab and ﬁnd it statistically compatible with zero at a level

16

of 0.3 %.

8 Conclusion

We have continuously measured the CEBAF electron beam polarization over

two periods of 30 days at an electron energy of 4.6 GeV and an average current

of 40 µA. The use of a highly segmented electron detector in coincidence with

the photon detector was a key element to reduce the systematic errors. By

using 40 minute runs a total relative systematic error of 1.2 % was achieved.

Thanks to our high-gain optical cavity and a double beam position feed-back, a

statistical accuracy of 1 % could be reached within 25 minutes. In the relative

variations of the beam polarization from one run to another the correlated

errors cancel out and the systematic error is reduced to 0.7 %. Because most

of the recent experiments in Hall A take advantage of the highly polarized and

intense electron beam available at JLab, the Compton polarimeter has been

routinely operated over the last three years to monitor the beam polarization.

Its performance are crucial for the upcoming parity experiments [13,14,15]

which aim for a very accurate measurements (

2%) in an energy range of

≤

0.85 to 3.00 GeV. Such a precision remains challenging and require detectors

and laser upgrades which are under study. At higher energy (6 GeV), sub-

percent measurements are feasible with only minor upgrades of the present

apparatus.

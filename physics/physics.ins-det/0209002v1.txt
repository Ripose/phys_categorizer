Abstract

The AMS spectrometer will be installed on the International Space Station in 2005.
Among other improvements over the ﬁrst version of the instrument, a ring imaging
Cherenkov detector (RICH) will be added and should open a new window for cosmic-
ray physics, allowing isotope separation up to A≈25 between 1 and 10 GeV/c and
element identiﬁcation up to Z≈25 between threshold and 1 TeV/c/nucleon. It should
also contribute to the high level of redundancy required for AMS and reject eﬃciency
albedo particles. A second generation prototype has been operated for a few months
: the architecture and the ﬁrst results are presented.

1 Introduction

The AMS spectrometer [1] will be implemented on the International Space
Station in 2005. The instrument will be made of a superconducting magnet
which inner volume will be mapped with a tracker consisting of 8 planes of sil-
icon microstrips with a set of detectors for particle identiﬁcation placed above
and below the magnet: scintillator hodoscopes, electromagnetic calorimeter
(ECAL), transition radiation detector (TRD) and ring imaging Cherenkov
(RICH). This contribution is devoted to a study a second generation proto-
type aiming at the RICH testing.

The physics capability of the RICH counter has been investigated by simula-
tions [2]. It should provide unique informations among the AMS detectors by
several respects :

• Isotopes separation up to A≈25 at best, over a momentum range extending

from about 1-2 GeV/c up to around 13 GeV/c.

• Identiﬁcation of chemical elements up to Z≈25 at best, up to approximately

1 TeV/nucleon.

• High eﬃciency rejection of albedo particles for momenta above the thresh-
old, between 1 GeV/c and 3.5 GeV/c depending on the type of radiator.

The RICH counter will allow to collect a unique sample of nuclear astrophysics
data with unprecedented statistical signiﬁcance over a momentum range to-
tally unexplored for the most interesting isotopes. Fig. 1 shows, as an example,
the 10Be to 9Be ratio with 6 weeks of counting time [3]. Both the number of
events and the covered energy range will dramatically improve the available
data (lower left points on the plot).

Recent works [4] have emphasized the importance of measuring cosmic nu-
clei spectra for: 1) Setting strong constraints on the astrophysical and cosmic
ray propagation parameters of the galaxy : the diﬀusion coeﬃcient normali-
sation and its spectral index, the halo thickness, the Alfv´en velocity and the
convection velocity; 2) Increasing the sensitivity to new physics search for su-
persymmetric particles or primordial back holes; 3) Testing for the nature of
the cosmic-ray sources : supernovae, stellar ﬂares, Wolf-Rayet stars, etc ...

2 New prototype

The second generation prototype has been developed by the RICH group of
the AMS collaboration. It is made of one half module of the ﬁnal counter and
has been operated for a few months.

It is equipped with R7600-M16 PMTs from Hamamatsu Inc. Ninety-six units
are used in the prototype, providing 1526 pixels. The R7600-M16 is a 16 pixels

PMT (16 × (4.5 × 4.5 mm2)) with 12 metal channel dynodes and a borosil-
icate glass window. The high voltage divider used is a compromise between
≈ 0.5) and linearity. Its total resistivity
single photoelectron resolution ( σ
Q
was ﬁxed at 80 MΩ, which allows a very low power consumption and remains
compatible with the expected trigger rate around 1kHz. The front-end elec-
tronics is placed next to the PMT on a ﬂex connector linked to the readout
bus. Each PMT is equipped with solid light guides to collect the Cherenkov
photons and to reduce the dead-space between photocathodes. This prototype
is installed in the same instrumental setup as the previous version [5] and uses
the same trigger and tracker system, which includes three NE102 plastic scin-
tillator units, coupled with RTC-2262B PMTs, for trigger deﬁnition, and a set
of three X-Y multiwire proportional chambers of 320 × 320 mm2 with 2 mm
wire step, and delay lines readout.
In cosmic-ray tests, the 3 available space points provide the trajectory recon-
struction in the radiator with a σtrack ≈ 1.9 mm in both directions, by means
of χ2 optimization procedure.

The main goals of this new generation of prototype are to validate the complex
assembly procedure, check the readout electronics settings and DAQ proce-
dure for all the output channels, investigate the PMT+electronics response
dynamics, measure the counter velocity resolution, test the whole structure
when submitted to vibrations, and validate the magnetic shielding eﬃciency.

It will also be tested with a secondary ion beam at CERN using a fragmenta-
tion target. The sample of nuclei from H to Fe should allow an accurate check
of the charge measurement resolution of the counter.

3 First results with cosmic rays

Fig 2 left gives an example of a Cherenkov ring obtained during a cosmic ray
run.
The best experimental velocity resolution obtained for cosmic ray test was
β = 15 10−3 with n = 1.33 NaF radiator (Cherenkov threshold around 480
δβ
β = 2.5 10−3 with n = 1.03 aerogel radiator as shown on
MeV/nucleon), δβ
β = 3.5 10−3 with n = 1.05 (Cherenkov threshold around
Fig 2 right, and δβ
3.5 GeV/nucleon). These resolutions are limited by the multiwire chambers
track reconstruction accuracy. Those results will be improved by increasing
the distance between chambers. Both the electronics and the PMTs behave as
expected.
The study has shown a good agreement between data and simulation and give
conﬁdence in the expected performances of the ﬁnal counter.

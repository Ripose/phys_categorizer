Architectures

We have developed two analytical models to describe the performance of cryogenic microcalorime-
ters and bolometers. One of the models is suitable to describe Transition Edge Sensor(TES) detec-
tors with an integrated absorber, the other is suitable for detectors with large absorbers. Both mod-
els take into account hot-electron decoupling and absorber decoupling. The diﬀerential equations
describing these models have been solved using block diagram algebra. Each model has produced
closed form solutions for the detector’s responsivity, dynamic impedance, and noise equivalent power
for phonon noise, Johnson noise, ampliﬁer noise, 1/f noise, and load resistor noise.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The operational principle of simple microcalorimeters and bolometers is based on three components. An absorber
where the incoming power or energy is dissipated and converted into a change in temperature, a sensor that reads
the change in temperature, and a thermal link from the detector to the heat sink that brings the system back to
equilibrium after a measurement. The sensor is usually a resistor whose resistance depends strongly on temperature
around the working point. In this case a change in resistance can be measured as a change in voltage or a change in
current using a current or voltage bias.

In 1982 J.C Mather1 presented a complete non-equilibrium theory for the noise in simple bolometers with ideal
resistive thermometers and in 1984 it was extended to microcalorimeter performance2. At temperatures below 200 mK
the ideal assumptions are no longer valid and complex thermal architectures are needed to understand the behavior
of these devices. At these low temperatures the thermal ﬂuctuations between the thermometer lattice and its electron
system, or between the thermometer and the absorber are no longer negligible and therefore these components must
be considered as separate entities in the model. These non-ideal eﬀects are called electron decoupling and absorber
decoupling. Another consequence of working at low temperatures is the increased dependence of the thermometer
resistance on the readout power, making the ideal resistance-temperature relationship inaccurate. Galeazzi and
McCammon3 constructed a general procedure for developing bolometer and microcalorimeter models for these complex
thermal architectures using block diagram formalism of control theory.

To quantify the relation between incoming power or energy and the measured change in voltage or current, including
non-ideal eﬀects, this paper follows the modeling procedure of Galeazzi and McCammon3. The ﬁrst step in this
modeling procedure is to set up the temperature equations, then apply a Taylor expansion to derive a linear model
for small temperature deviations from equilibrium. Afterward, Fourier transforms are used to express the equations
in the frequency domain, and ﬁnally the coupled equations are solved using block diagram algebra. This procedure
yields closed form solutions for the responsivity and dynamic impedance of the model, including noise contributions.
The two models developed in this paper are modiﬁcations of the absorber decoupling model obtained in3. Model 1
was developed to describe the new generation of transition edge sensor detectors where the absorber is not electrically
isolated from the thermometer by a gluing agent but rather the two are deposited one on top of the other4. Model 2
describes microcalorimeters that have the heat sink connected to the absorber instead of to the thermometer. This
may occur when the absorber is much bigger than the thermometer and therefore it is necessary to connect the
heat sink to the absorber rather than to the thermometer. These two models will help optimize the next generation
of detectors, and because of the analytical results of the modeling procedure the relations between the detector’s
resolution and the diﬀerent parameters included in the model should be clear.

II. MODEL 1

This model is suitable to describe TES detectors with an integrated absorber. In this model both the electron system
and the absorber are detached from the lattice. The lattice is connected to the heat sink by a thermal conductivity
G, the electron system is connected to the lattice by a thermal conductivity Ge−l, and the absorber is connected to
the electron system by a thermal conductivity Ga ( see Fig. 1). The absorber is directly connected to the electron
system instead of the lattice because with integrated absorbers the absorber-lattice thermal coupling is expected to
be negligible compared to that of the absorber-electron system.

The following equations determine the temperature for each of the three components in the model:

e) is
the Joule power dissipated into the sensor by the bias current/voltage. In the case of microcalorimeters W = Eδ(to),
where E is the photon energy and δ(to) is the delta function.

l are the corresponding temperatures. W is the incoming outside power to be measured and P (T ′

The equilibrium conditions of the system are obtained by setting the outside power to zero (W = 0), and d(T ′

x)/dt =
0 (x= a, e, or l) since the equilibrium temperatures are independent of time. Therefore the equilibrium temperatures
Ta of the absorber, Te of the electron system, and Tl of the lattice are given by the integrals in the previous three
equations. For example the integral in Eq. 1 must equal zero at equilibrium, which implies that the thermal equilibrium
temperature of the absorber is the same as that of the electron system. We are interested in small deviations about
the equilibrium temperatures, therefore we set T ′
x = Tx + ∆Tx, where Tx is the equilibrium temperature for each
component of the model, and ∆Tx is the small temperature deviation from equilibrium:

In the small signal limit ∆Tx is small compared to Tx, and a Taylor expansion up to the ﬁrst ∆Tx term is appropriate.

The results are the equations that determine small temperature deviations about equilibrium:

where ∆P = P (Te + ∆Te) − P (Te), and for simplicity we used Ga = Ga(Ta) and G = G(Tl).

These are coupled diﬀerential equations which are diﬃcult to solve directly; instead they are transformed into
coupled algebraic equations using Fourier transforms. The quantity ∆P represents what is known as the electro-
thermal feedback term and can be written as ∆P = −GET F ∆Te, where GET F = P (R − RL)α/TeR(RL + R); (see
reference3). Converting Eqs. 7, 8, and 9 into the frequency domain using Fourier transforms we obtain:

jωCa∆Ta + Ga∆Ta = W + Ga∆Te

With these equations it is possible to solve for ∆Te, which can be related to the measured quantities ∆I or ∆V ,

where α = Te/R × dR/dTe is the sensitivity of the detector, RL is the load resistance, R is the resistance of the
detector, V is the voltage across R, and I is the current ﬂowing through R.

To simplify the notation let X be either V or I, and introduce the quantity Atr = R/X × dX/dR to be deduced

from the previous two equations. Then Eqs. 13 and 14 can be summarized as:

Equations 10, 11, 12, and 15 can be solved using the block diagram of Fig. 3. To set up the block diagram consider
the left hand side of Eqs.10, 11, 12, and 15 as the response function of the absorber system, electron system, lattice
system, and circuit readout respectively. The right hand side of these equations corresponds to the input to each
system. Connecting the response functions with their appropriate inputs leads to the block diagram of Fig. 3.

To solve the block diagram in Fig. 3 for ∆X(ω) we used the procedure and simpliﬁcation rules of the block diagram
formalism described in3. This result is then used to ﬁnd the responsivity, which is deﬁned as S(ω) = ∆X(ω)/W (ω).
The following responsivity characterizes the response of Model 1 detectors:

B. Dynamic Impedance

A detector can also be described by its complex dynamic impedance Z(ω) = dV (ω)/dI(ω). The dynamic impedance
diﬀers from the detector resistance due to the eﬀect of the electro-thermal feedback. When the current changes, the
power dissipated into the detector changes too, therefore the temperature and the detector’s resistance change. The
dynamic impedance is a useful parameter because it is easily measured experimentally. To ﬁnd the dynamic impedance
we use −GET F ∆Te = ∆P in Eqs. 11, and use Eqs. 10, 11, and 12 to ﬁnd ∆Te in terms of ∆P , ω, the heat capacity
of each of the three components, and the three thermal conductivities:

(17)

Diﬀerentiating Ohm’s law (V = IR) and using the deﬁnition of sensitivity α we obtain:

Substituting Eq. 17 into Eq 18 and using the fact that dP = V dI + IdV , it is possible to solve for dV /dI and obtain
the following result for the dynamic impedance:

C. Noise

.

The eﬀect of noise on a detector’s performance is quantiﬁed by the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP). It corresponds
to the power that would be required as input to the detector in order to generate an output equal to the signal
generated by the noise. The NEP can therefore be calculated as the ratio between the output generated by the noise
and the responsivity of the detector:

The variable y stands in for any of the possible noise terms: amp=ampliﬁer noise, j=Johnson noise, RL=load resistor
noise, 1/f =1/f noise, a=absorber-electron system thermal noise, th=heat sink-lattice thermal noise or he=electron
system-lattice thermal noise.

To obtain the Noise Equivalent Power for each term, the noise contributions eamp, ej, eRL , PRL , (∆R/R)1/f , Pa,
Pth, and Phe must be added to the block diagram of Fig. 3. Figure 4 shows where each noise term should be added
to the block diagram (for more details see3). Solving the noise block diagram for each noise term independently and
dividing by the responsivity obtained in Eq. 16 we obtain the following NEP’s:

III. MODEL 2

In experiments involving dark matter detectors and double-beta decay detectors the absorber size is signiﬁcant and
can have a mass up to almost 1 Kg5. For mechanical reasons these large absorbers must be mechanically connected
to the heat sink. The thermal link between the detector and the heat sink can therefore also be through the absorber
rather than through the sensor. Model 2 reﬂects this condition by having the absorber connected to the heat sink
through a thermal conductivity G. Model 2 also takes into account absorber decoupling and electron decoupling by
connecting the lattice system to the absorber through a thermal conductivity Ga and by having the electron system
connected to the lattice system through a thermal conductivity Ge−l (see Fig. 5).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

To improve the performance of microcalorimeters and bolometers it is important to accurately understand how
it depends on the fabrications parameters. Signiﬁcant improvements in detectors performance have, in fact, been
achieved by optimizing the design based on an accurate model of the detector6. In this paper we derived detailed
theoretical models to describe the behavior of two diﬀerent detector architectures. The use of block diagram algebra
has allowed us to present the results in an analytical form that can be easily and immediately utilized by investigators
to improve the design of their detectors.

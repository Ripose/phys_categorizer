Abstract

Stable electrostatic levitation and trapping of a neutral, polarizable
object by a charged ring is shown to be theoretically impossible. Earn-
shaw’s theorem precludes the existence of such a stable, neutral particle
trap.

1 Introduction

In this tribute in honor of the memory of Prof. Dr. Herbert Walther, we
consider the possibility of extending his famous work on the trapping of an
ordered lattice of ions [1] in a Paul trap [2], to the trapping of neutral atoms, and
more generally, to the levitation of a macroscopic neutral polarizable object, in
a purely electrostatic trap, for example, in the DC electric ﬁeld conﬁguration of
a charged ring. Earnshaw’s theorem will be extended to the case of such neutral
objects, and we shall show below that the stable levitation and trapping of a
neutral, polarizable object, which is a high-ﬁeld seeker, is generally impossible
in an arbitrary electrostatic ﬁeld conﬁguration. We shall do this ﬁrst for the
special case of the electrostatic conﬁguration of a simple charged ring, and then
for the general case of any DC electric ﬁeld conﬁguration.

Consider the charged-ring geometry shown in Figure 1. The region near
the so-called “levitation” point L in this Figure is akin to the focal region of
a lens in optics. Just as two converging rays of light emerging from a lens
in physical optics cannot truly cross at a focus, but rather will undergo an

Figure 1: A uniformly charged ring with radius a lies on the horizontal x-
y plane, with its axis of symmetry pointing along the vertical z axis. Can
levitation and trapping of a neutral particle occur stably near point L, where
there is a convergence of E-ﬁeld lines?

“avoided crossing” near the focal point of this lens due to diﬀraction, so likewise
two converging lines of the electric ﬁeld cannot cross, and therefore they will
also undergo an “avoided crossing” near L. There results a maximum in the
z component of the electric ﬁeld along the vertical z axis at point L. The
resulting “avoided crossing” region of electric ﬁeld lines in the vicinity of point
L is therefore similar to the Gaussian beam-waist region of a focused laser beam.
Ashkin and his colleagues [3] showed that small dielectric particles, which are
high-ﬁeld seekers, are attracted to, and can be stably trapped at, such Gaussian
beam waists in “optical tweezers”. Similarly here a neutral dielectric particle,
which is a high-ﬁeld seeker, will also be attracted to the region of the convergence
of E-ﬁeld lines in the neighborhood of L, where there is a local maximum in the
electric ﬁeld along the z axis. The question arises: Can such a high-ﬁeld seeker
be stably levitated and trapped near L?

2 Calculation of the electric potential and ﬁeld

of a charged ring

The electric potential at the ﬁeld point P due to a charge element dq′ of the
ring is given in by

dΦ =

dq′
r

where the distance r from the source point, whose coordinates are (x′, y′, 0), to
the ﬁeld point P , whose coordinates are (x, 0, z), is

r =

(x′

x)2 + y′2 + z2.

p

(Primed quantities refer to the source point; unprimed ones to the ﬁeld point).
Since the charged ring forms a circle of radius a which lies on the horizontal x-y
plane,

direction. Note that the trap is azimuthally symmetric around the vertical axis,
so that the x and y directions are equivalent to each other. Because of the
negativity of two of the three Hooke’s constants kx, ky, and kz, the trap will
be unstable for small displacements in two of the three spatial dimensions near
L, and hence L is a saddle point. Note also that the sum of the three Hooke’s
constants in Equations (16),(19), and (20) is zero, i.e.,

3 Earnshaw’s theorem revisited

We shall see that Equation (21) can be derived from Earnshaw’s theorem when
one generalizes this theorem from the case of a charged particle to the case of a
neutral, polarizable particle in an arbitrary DC electrostatic ﬁeld conﬁguration.
A quantitative consideration of the force on the particle due to the uniform
gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth, in conjunction with the force due to the DC
electrostatic ﬁeld conﬁguration, does not change the general conclusion that
the mechanical equilibrium for both charged and neutral polarizable particles is
unstable.

4 Charged particle case

We shall ﬁrst brieﬂy review here Earnshaw’s theorem [4], which implies an
instability of a charged particle placed into any conﬁguration of electrostatic
ﬁelds in a charge-free region of space in the absence of gravity. Suppose that
there exist a point L of mechanical equilibrium of a charged particle with charge
q in the presence of arbitrary DC electrostatic ﬁelds in empty space. The
potential Φ for these ﬁelds obey Laplace’s equation

2Φ =

However, Laplace’s equation, Equation (22), can be rewritten as follows:

kx + ky + kz = 0,

(28)

i.e., the sum of the three components of Hooke’s constants for the charged par-
ticle must be exactly zero. The simultaneous positivity of all three Hooke’s
constants is inconsistent with this, and hence at least one of the Hooke’s con-
stants along one of the three spatial directions must be negative. Therefore the
system is unstable.

The azimuthally symmetric ﬁeld conﬁgurations like that of a charged ring
is an important special case. Let z be the vertical symmetry axis of the ring.
Suppose that there is stability in the longitudinal z direction (such as along the
z axis above point L), so that

5 Adding a uniform gravitational ﬁeld such as
the Earth’s, in the case of a charged object

The potential energy of a charged, massive particle in a DC electrostatic ﬁeld
in the presence of Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld is

Utot = qΦ + mgz.

(35)

7

Note that the term due to gravity, i.e., the mgz term, is linear in z, and therefore
will vanish upon taking the second partial derivatives of this term. Therefore
the Hooke’s constants kx, ky, and kz will be unaﬀected by Earth’s gravity. The
force on the particle is

Ftot =

∇Utot =

q∇Φ

mgez

−

−

−

(36)

where ez is the unit vector in the vertical z direction.
In equilibrium, Ftot =
0, but this equilibrium is again unstable, since upon taking another partial
derivative of the term mgez with respect to z will yield zero, and therefore
all of the above Hooke’s law constants are the same in the presence as in the
absence of Earth’s gravity.

6 Generalization to the case of a neutral, polar-

izable particle

Now suppose that there exists a point L of mechanical equilibrium of the neu-
tral particle with positive polarizability α > 0 somewhere within an arbitrary
electrostatic ﬁeld conﬁguration. Such a particle is a high-ﬁeld seeker, and hence
point L must be a point of high ﬁeld strength. Choose the coordinate system
so that the z axis is aligned with respect to the local dominant electric ﬁeld
at point L. Thus the dominant electric ﬁeld component at L is thus Ez. The
potential energy U for a neutral particle with polarizability α in the presence
of an electric ﬁeld (Ex, Ey, Ez) is given by

U =

since the contributions to U from the x and y components of the electric ﬁeld,
which vanish as ε4 near the z axis for small ε, can be neglected in a small
neighborhood of L. The force on the particle is

Therefore the z component of the force is, to a good approximation,

7 Adding a uniform gravitational ﬁeld such as
the Earth’s, in the case of a neutral, polariz-
able object

The potential energy of a neutral, polarizable, massive particle in a DC electro-
static ﬁeld plus Earth’s gravity is

Utot = U + mgz.

Again, note that the term due to gravity, i.e., the mgz term, is linear in z, and
therefore will vanish upon taking the second partial derivatives of this term.
Therefore again the Hooke’s constants kx, ky, and kz will not be aﬀected by
Earth’s gravity. The force on the particle is

Ftot =

∇Utot =

−

where ez is the unit vector in the vertical z direction.
In equilibrium, Ftot =
0, but this equilibrium is again unstable, since upon taking another partial
derivative of the term mgez with respect to z will yield zero, and therefore
again all of the above Hooke’s law constants are the same in the presence as in
the absence of Earth’s gravity.

8 Ways to evade Earnshaw’s theorem

Some known ways to evade Earnshaw’s theorem and thereby to construct a
truly stable trap for charged particles or for neutral particles are (1) to use
non-electrostatic ﬁelds such as a DC magnetic ﬁeld (e.g., the Penning trap [5])
in conjunction with DC electric ﬁelds, or (2) to use time-varying, AC electric
ﬁelds, rather than DC ﬁelds (e.g., the Paul trap [2]), or (3) to use active feedback
to stabilize the neutral equilibrium of a charged particle in a uniform electric
ﬁeld, such as was done for a charged superﬂuid helium drop [6], or (4) to use
the low-ﬁeld seeking property of neutral, diamagnetic objects to levitate them
in strong, inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds [7]. The latter two methods may be
useful for levitating the superﬂuid helium “Millikan oil drops” in the experiment
described in [8].

Abstract— The ATLAS Pixel Detector is the innermost layer of
the ATLAS tracking system and will contribute signiﬁcantly to the
ATLAS track and vertex reconstruction. The detector consists of
identical sensor-chip-hybrid modules, arranged in three barrels in
the centre and three disks on either side for the forward region.
The position of the Pixel Detector near the interaction point
requires excellent radiation hardness, mechanical and thermal
robustness, good long-term stability, all combined with a low
material budget. The detector layout, results from production
modules and the status of assembly are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE ATLAS Inner Detector [2] is designed for precision

tracking of charged particles with 40 MHz bunch crossing
identiﬁcation. It combines tracking straw tubes in the outer
transition-radiation tracker (TRT) and microstrip detectors of
the semiconductor tracker (SCT) in the middle with the Pixel
Detector,
the crucial part for vertex reconstruction, as the
innermost component.

The Pixel Detector [1] is subdivided into three barrel layers
in its centre, one of them around the beam pipe (r = 5 cm),
and three disks on either side for the forward direction. With a
total length of approx. 1.3 m this results in a three-hit system
for particles with |η| < 2.5.

The main components are approx. 1700 identical sensor-
chip-hybrid modules, corresponding to a total of 8 · 107 pixels.
The modules have to be radiation hard to an ATLAS life time
dose of 50 MRad or 1015 neutron-equivalent.

to 16 front-end (FE) chips using ﬁne pitch “bump bonding”
either done with Pb/Sn by IZM1 or with Indium by AMS2.
These chips are connected to a module-control chip (MCC) [4]
mounted on a kapton-ﬂex-hybrid glued onto the back-side
of the sensor. The MCC communicates with the off-detector
electronics via opto-links, whereas power is fed into the chips
via cables connected to the ﬂex-hybrid. A cross-section of an
ATLAS pixel module is shown in ﬁgure 1.

To provide a high space-point resolution of approx. 12 µm
in azimuth (rφ), and approx. 110 µm parallel to the LHC beam
(z), the sensor is subdivided into 41,984 “standard” pixels of
50 µm in rφ by 400 µm in z, and 5284 “long” pixels of
50 × 600 µm2. The long pixels are necessary to cover the
gaps between adjacent front-end chips. The module has 46,080
read-out channels, which is smaller than the number of pixels
because there is a 200 µm gap in between FE chips on opposite
sides of the module, and to get full coverage the last eight pixels
at the gap must be connected to only four channels (“ganged”
and “inter-ganged” pixels). Thus on 5% of the surface the
information has a two-fold ambiguity that will be resolved off-
line.

The FE chips [5] contain 2880 individual charge sensitive
analogue circuits with a digital read-out that operates at 40 MHz
clock. The analogue part consists of a high-gain, fast preampli-
ﬁer followed by a DC-coupled second stage and a differential
discriminator. The threshold of the discriminator ranges up to
1 fC, its nominal value being 0.5 fC. When a hit is detected
by the discriminator the pixel address is provided together
with the time over threshold (ToT) information which allows
reconstruction of the charge seen by the preampliﬁer.

III. MODULE PERFORMANCE

During prototyping several ten prototype modules have been
built with two generations of radiation-hard chips in 0.25 µm-
technology before the production started with the ﬁnal chip
generation in early 2004. Up to now roughly 200 modules have
been built; in order to assure full functionality of the modules
in the later experiment each module will be extensively tested
after assembly including measurements at the production sites
before and after thermal cycling. Moreover, several modules
from different production sites have been tested in a test beam
and after irradiation with charged hadrons.

A pixel module consists of an oxygenated single n-on-n
silicon sensor, approx. 2×6 cm2 in size [3]. The sensor is
subdivided into 47,268 pixels which are connected individually

A. Laboratory measurements

An important test that allows a large range of in-laboratory
measurements is the threshold scan. Signals are created with on-
chip charge injection and scanning the number of hits versus the

so injected charge yields the physical value of the threshold of
the discriminator and the equivalent noise charge as seen by the
preampliﬁer. A set of such scans is used to reduce the threshold
dispersion by adjusting a 7-bit DAC-parameter individually for
each channel, a procedure that takes about 1 hour. The resulting
threshold and noise after threshold tuning is shown in ﬁgures 2
and 3. Typically approx. 60 e− threshold dispersion across a
module and a noise value of well below 200 e− for standard
pixels is achieved, as is needed for good performance.

Note that there is not a single pixel with threshold lower
than 3, 900 e−. This shows the high tuning capability of this
chip allowing to reach small thresholds on the whole module
without any pixel having its threshold too close to the noise, a
fact in particular important after irradiation.

In a similar fashion, the cross-talk is measured to a few per

cent for standard 50 × 400 µm2 pixels.

A measurement of the timewalk, i.e. the variation in the time
when the discriminator input goes above threshold, is an issue
since hits with a low deposited charge have an arrival time later
than those with high charges, in particular for ganged pixels.
The difference in effective threshold for a signal arrival time
of less than 20 ns and discriminator threshold is for standard
pixels approx. 1500 e−, for ganged pixels approx. 2300 e−
and for long pixels approx. 2000 e−, see ﬁgure 4. Because
the discriminator threshold can easily be tuned to values below
3000 e− the shown timewalk is sufﬁcient to meet the ATLAS
requirement of 6000 e− for all pixels.

Data taken when illuminating the sensor with a radioactive
source allows in-laboratory detection of defective channels.
Such a measurement obtained with an Am241-source can be
seen in ﬁgure 5. 1, 400, 000 events per FE-chips have been
accumulated for this measurement to ensure enough hits per
channel for a subsequent analysis. The integrated source-
spectrum for all pixels reconstructed from the ToT-readings is
in agreement with expectations (see ﬁgure 5, middle plot); the
main 60 keV γ peak can clearly be distinguished from the
background which is dominated by events with charge sharing
between neighbouring pixels. Furthermore the individual pixel
spectrum (see ﬁgure 5, lower plot) can be used for an absolute
charge calibration per readout channel, because here also the
60 keV γ line can be identiﬁed.

EACH CHANNEL OF THE MODULE HAS BEEN INDIVIDUALLY CALIBRATED

AND THE UPPER SHOWN SPECTRUM IS A SUM OVER ALL PIXEL WITHOUT

ANY CLUSTERING WHEREAS THE LOWER SHOWN SPECTRUM IS FOR ONE

SINGLE CHANNEL.

Up to now roughly 150 modules have been produced and
completely characterized; every module undergoes an extensive
test procedure to ensure good performance inside the ATLAS
detector. This includes tests at room temperature as well as tests
at the the operation temperature of −10◦C. A thermal cycling
of at least 48 hours between −30◦C and +30◦C is also part of
the procedure. Finally each module will be tuned and calibrated
for a source test to evaluate the number of non-efﬁcient pixels.
The resulting distribution for the ﬁrst 150 modules produced is

shown in ﬁgure 6. Typically the number of defective channels
per modules is far less than 50 or 0.1% of all 46,080 pixels
showing the excellent hybridization yield of the used ﬁne pitch
bump bonding.

B. Test beam measurements

Tests have been performed in the beam line of the SPS
at CERN using 180 GeV/c hadrons. The setup consists of
a beam telescope for the position measurement [6], trigger
scintillators for timing measurement to 36 ps, and up to four
pixel modules. The number of defective channels is observed to
less than 10−3. For standard 50×400 µm2 pixels the efﬁciency
for normal incidence particles is 99.90±0.15% which can be
seen in ﬁgure 7. Because this efﬁciency measurement is done
in dependency of the incident particle time it allows also a
measurement of the timewalk. The so measured timewalk is in
agreement to those from lab tests (see above) giving a timing
window of 15 ns with high efﬁciency.

Furthermore the efﬁciency of the ATLAS pixel modules can
be improved to perfect values of 100.00−0.03% by using a
digital hit duplication of the front end chip (see ﬁgure 8). The
method duplicates all hits below an adjustable ToT threshold
to the previous bunch crossing to recover the hit information
for small charges. Of course the drawback of this method is an
increase of the data volume inside the chip.

The space resolutions measured for one hit and two hit
clusters for different incident particle angles, i.e. approx. 12 µm
in rφ and 110 µm in z as expected for the pixel size of
50 × 400 µm2.

Seven production modules have been irradiated at CERN PS
with 24 GeV/c protons to a dose of 50 MRad (1·1015 neqcm−2),
approx. the dose expected after 10 years of ATLAS operation.
The radiation damage is monitored reading the leakage current
individually for each pixel. During irradiation the single event
upset probability was measured to the order of 10−11 SEUs
per proton for the 14 pixel latches of each individual pixel cell
showing no problems with such a harsch radiation environment.
The noise after irradiation as shown in ﬁgure 9 is only mod-
estly increased and still well in agreement with requirements
for operation in ATLAS. Also the threshold dispersion of such
a highly irradiated module can be tuned to values of 60 e− as
before irradiation.

Irradiated modules have been tested in the beam line as
described in section III-B and the bias voltage needed for
full depletion is measured to be between 400 and 500 V,
see ﬁgure 10. The deposited charge measured via the ToT
readings and the mean charge for irradiated modules is ap-
prox. 15,000 e− for a m.i.p. with an acceptable uniformity
w.r.t. unirradiated modules.

Similar efﬁciency versus incident particle arrival time mea-
surements as described in the previous section show for the
highly irradiated modules efﬁciency values of 98.23±0.15%,
well above the end-of-lifetime requirement of 95%, see ﬁg-
ure 11. The slope of the efﬁciency curve is slightly distorted
w.r.t. unirradiated modules because of poor charge collection in
a small region of the irradiated sensor (“bias-dot” region) which
was implemented to allow reasonable testing of the sensor
without readout electronics [3], [7].

IV. OFF-DETECTOR ELECTRONICS

The off-detector readout electronics is designed to process
data at a rate of up to 100 kHz level-1 triggers. The main
data-processing component is the “read-out driver” (ROD), of
which ﬁnal prototypes have been built to pixel speciﬁcations
and are being evaluated. The ﬁrst-step event-building and error
ﬂagging is done via FPGAs. The communication to the rest
of the DAQ-system is run through a 1.6 Gbit/s opto-link. The
communication to modules, online monitoring and calibration
runs are performed with SRAMs and DSPs; their programming
is ongoing and modules and small systems have already been
conﬁgured and operated successfully with a ROD.

All components of the off-detector electronics are in produc-

tion now and the progress and yields are well on track.

V. SYSTEM ASPECTS

A. Support structures

The mechanics of the system has to guarantee good po-
sitional stability of the modules during operation while the
amount of material has to be kept to a minimum. At the same
time it has to provide cooling to remove the heat load from the
modules and maintain the sensors at a temperature of -6◦C to
keep the radiation damage low.

Barrel-modules are glued to “staves”,

long, ﬂat carbon-
structures with embedded cooling pipes. The staves are
mounted inside halfshells, which themselves are assembled into
frames to form the barrel system.

The disks are assembled from carbon-sectors with embedded
cooling covering 1/8 of a wheel. The modules are glued directly
to either side of the disk sectors.

The module loading to staves and disk sectors requires high
position accuracy and good thermal contact without any risks
to damage modules during the process. First disk sectors and
barrel staves have been assembled with modules showing un-
changed performance of the individual modules after assembly.
The global support structures of the pixel detector are also
made of carbon structures and have been recently delivered.
Currently these structures are under test at CERN.

B. Systemtests

First systemtests have been performed with six modules on a
disk sector and thirteen modules on a barrel-stave. The noise be-
haviour on the disks or staves shows no signiﬁcant differences
compared to similar measurements with the same modules
individually. Larger systemtests are already in preparation and
will include realistic powering and read-out.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Production modules built with the ﬁnal generation of ra-
diation hard chips show largely satisfying performance in
laboratory-test, in test beam studies and after irradiation. Mod-
ule production is well in grogress with high yield and an
acceptable rate to ﬁnish the ATLAS pixel detector in time.

Work on the off-detector electronics and the support struc-
tures have been going on in parallel and are well on track. First
systemtest results are promising.

Free-Space Antenna Field/Pattern Retrieval
in Reverberation Environments

Vincenzo Fiumara, Adele Fusco, Vincenzo Matta, Innocenzo M. Pinto

Abstract— Simple algorithms for retrieving free-space antenna
ﬁeld or directivity patterns from complex (ﬁeld) or real (intensity)
measurements taken in ideal reverberation environments are
introduced and discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Antenna measurements are usually performed under simu-
lated free-space conditions, e.g. by placing the antenna under
test (henceforth AUT) as well as the measuring probe in
an open test-range or in an electromagnetic (henceforth EM)
anechoic chamber [1].

Retrieving free-space antenna ﬁeld and/or directivity pat-
terns from measurements taken in any realistic (i.e., imperfect)
test-range or anechoic chamber relies on the possibility of re-
constructing the ray skeleton of the measured ﬁeld using robust
spectral estimation techniques, including, e.g., periodogram,
Prony, Pisarenko, Matrix-Pencil and Gabor algorithms [2]-[5],
so as to ”subtract” all environment-related reﬂected/diffracted
ﬁelds.

The direct (free-space) ﬁeld, however, cannot be unambigu-
ously identiﬁed, unless additional assumptions are made about
its relative intensity and/or phase, which do not hold true in
the most general case.

A possible way to uniquely extract the free-space (direct
path) ﬁeld is to average over many measurements obtained by
suitably changing the position of the source-probe pair with
respect to the environment, while keeping the source-probe
mutual distance and orientation ﬁxed. This obviously leaves
the free-space direct-path term unchanged, while affecting
both the amplitudes and the phases of all environment-related
reﬂected/diffracted ﬁelds. In the limit of a large number
of measurements, one might expect that these latter would
eventually average to zero. This is the rationale behind the
idea of retrieving free-space antenna parameters from mea-
surements taken in a reverberation enclosure (henceforth RE),
where the chamber boundary is effectively moved through
several positions by mechanical stirring, while the source-
probe distance and mutual orientation is ﬁxed.

Through the last decades reverberation enclosures earned
the status of elicited EMI-EMC assessment tools [6]. On the
other hand, only recently effective procedures for estimating
antenna parameters, including efﬁciency [7], diversity-gain [8],
MIMO-array channel capacity [9], and free-space radiation
resistance [10], from measurements made in a reverberation
chamber have been introduced by Kildal and co-workers, in a
series of pioneering papers.

Benevento, Italy. E-mail: pinto@sa.infn.it

Here we discuss, perhaps for the ﬁrst

time, free-space
antenna ﬁeld/directivity pattern retrieval from measurements
taken in a reverberation environment.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II the key
relevant properties of reverberation enclosure ﬁelds are sum-
marized. In Sect. III and IV simple algorithms for retrieving
free-space antenna ﬁeld or directivity patterns, respectively
from (complex) ﬁeld or (real) intensity measurements made
in a reverberation environment are discussed, including the
related absolute and relative errors. The related efﬁciency is the
subject of Sect. V, including some useful concepts on Cramer-
Rao bounds. Conclusions follow under Sect. VI.

II. FIELDS IN REVERBERATION ENVIRONMENTS

In the following we shall sketch and evaluate some straight-
forward procedures to estimate the free-space antenna ﬁeld or
directivity pattern from measurements made in a reverberation
enclosure.

The AUT ﬁeld/intensity will be sampled at a suitable
number of points P of the AUT-centered sphere r = R,
corresponding to as many sampling directions. At each point
P we shall actually make N measurements in the reverberation
environment corresponding to as many different positions of
the mode stirrers.

Throughout the rest of this paper we shall restrict to the
simplest case where both the antenna under test and the ﬁeld-
probe (henceforth FP) are linearly (co)polarized, and placed
in an ideal (fully-stirred) reverberation environment.

The relevant component of the complex electromagnetic

(henceforth EM) ﬁeld at a point P can be written:

E(P, n) = Ed(P )+Er(P, n), n = 1, 2,. . ., N.

(1)

The ﬁrst
term in (1) is the direct ﬁeld, and is the only
term which would exist in free-space; the second term is the
(pure) reverberation ﬁeld, whose value depends on the stirrers’
positions1, and n identiﬁes the different stirrers’ positions.

{

n = 1, 2, . . . , N
Er(P, n)
|

According to a widely accepted model [11], for any ﬁxed
P , the set
, can be regarded as an
ensemble of identically distributed (pseudo) random variables
resulting from the superposition of a large number of plane
waves with uniformly distributed phases and arrival directions.
Under these ideal (but not unrealistic) assumptions the real
and imaginary part of the reverberation ﬁeld Er(P, n) will be
gaussian distributed2 and uncorrelated, with zero averages and

latter is related to the total power Πt radiated into the enclosure
by the AUT as follows [14] :

III. AUT FREE-SPACE FIELD ESTIMATOR

Under the made assumption where the real and imaginary
part of the reverberation ﬁeld Er are independent, zero-average
gaussian random variables, it is natural to adopt the following
estimator of the free-space (complex) AUT ﬁeld at P in terms
of the (complex) ﬁelds (1):

distance ﬁxed, this will at the same time make θ larger, in
view of eq. (10), thus reducing the relative error (9), when
meaningful, as well. Note that this is true for both far and
near-ﬁeld measurements.

IV. AUT DIRECTIVITY ESTIMATOR

(3)

The AUT directivity can be estimated from (far ﬁeld)
intensity measurements made in a reverberation enclosure as
follows. Let

(4)

(5)

I(P, n) = Re2E(P, n)+Im2E(P, n), n = 1, 2,. . ., N.

(11)

It is convenient to scale the ﬁeld intensities I(P, n) to the
variance in (2), by letting ξn(P ) = 2I(P, n)/E2
0 , so that all
the ξn are (identically) distributed according to a noncentral
chi-square with two degrees of freedom [15] and non-centrality
parameter θ(P ) given by eq. (10).

We may use the obvious far ﬁeld formula:

2 =
Ed(P )
|
|

2η0Πt
4πR2 D(P ),

(12)

where D(P ) is the AUT directivity, together with eq.s (3) and
(4) in eq. (10) to relate θ to the AUT directivity D as follows

actually zero, i.e., for which the variance of each component

where the ξk are independent and identically distributed, with
a PDF f (ξ; X) depending on a single parameter X, equation

One can readily prove that the ﬁeld estimator (6) is an

CRLB. The simplest directivity estimator (16), on the other
hand, while not efﬁcient, gets very close to its CRLB, as shown
below.

The Cramer-Rao bound for the estimator (16), is obtained
by using the following formula, which follows directly from

VI. CONCLUSIONS

Free-space antenna ﬁeld/directivity measurements in ideal
reverberation enclosures have been shortly described and
evaluated. The main simplifying assumptions (linearly co-
polarized AUT and FP) can be more or less easily relaxed at
the expense of minor formal complications which do not alter
the main conclusions. On the basis of these preliminary results,
the possibility of performing cheap, simple and reliable in situ
antenna measurements using, e.g., ﬂexible conductive thin-ﬁlm
deployable/inﬂatable enclosures with air-blow stirring [20],
[21] is envisaged.

V. EFFICIENCY OF PROPOSED ESTIMATORS

An obvious question is now whether one could do better

using different estimators, other than (6) and (16).

The natural benchmark for gauging the goodness of an esti-
mator is the well-known Cramer-Rao lower bound (henceforth
CRLB) [19]. We limit ourselves here to remind a few basic
deﬁnitions and properties. Let ξ =

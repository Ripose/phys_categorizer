Abstract

A self quenching streamer (SQS), or limited streamer mode has been studied in
single wire chambers with cross-sections 12·12 mm2 and wire diameters 15, 25 and
50 µm. Chambers were ﬁlled with either pure dimethyl ether (DME) or isobutane
gases and irradiated with 148Gd alpha and 55Fe x-ray sources. Clear transitions from
a proportional to 100% SQS mode were observed on all three diameter wires with
both gases irradiated with alpha particles. Double SQS discharges due to inclined
tracks observed in DME gas allowed an estimation of a streamer size along the wire
of less than 1 mm. The second SQS discharge appears less than 1 mm from the
ﬁrst within about 500 ns. Charge spectra obtained with DME irradiated with 55Fe
x-rays might also be interpreted as a transition to a SQS mode, although no direct
evidence of that was seen in the observed pulse shapes.

PACS: 29.40Cs; 52.80.-s

Key words: Self quenching streamer, limited streamer, DME, isobutane.

1 Introduction

Since the ﬁrst observation of self quenching streamer (SQS), or limited
streamer signals [1,2], most models attempting to explain this discharge have
employed the mechanism of photon ionization of the gas [3,4,5]. In fact, most
studies of a SQS mode have been done with noble gas based mixtures. The high
probability of gas ionization by photons emitted by the excited atoms makes
it possible to produce SQS signals due to an initial ionization by x-rays or

beta-particles. However, the observation of SQS discharges in pure quenching
gases of hydrocarbons irradiated with alpha particles [6,7] demonstrated the
more complicated nature of this type of discharge.

This work presents a study of the transition from proportional to SQS
mode in single wire chambers ﬁlled with either pure dimethyl ether (DME)
or iso-C4H10 gases irradiated with 148Gd alpha particles or 55Fe x-rays. Both
DME and iso-C4H10 are excellent quenchers and should provide a transition
from a proportional to SQS mode without inﬂuence of photons. This could
provide data for a better understanding of the nature of this discharge.

2 Experimental setup

Single wire chambers with 15, 25 and 50 µm diameter wires were used to
carry out the tests. The chambers have square 12·12 mm2 cross sections and
were made of aluminum alloy with 6.35 µm thick aluminized mylar windows
on two sides. Wire lengths are approximately 20 cm.

Chambers were irradiated with 3.183 MeV 148Gd alpha particles and
5.9 keV 55Fe x-rays. During most test measurements sources were placed di-
rectly over the wires on a 1.6 mm thick aluminum plate with 1.2 mm diameter
collimating hole. The distance from the source to the cathode foil is about
2.3 mm. Under these conditions alpha particles entering normal to the cham-
ber lose about 1.65 MeV energy in the chamber gas volume. Their track lengths
are about 2.35 mm in chambers ﬁlled with iso-C4H10, and 3.1 mm with DME.
Alpha particles produce about 7·104 ion-electron pairs, while the x-ray par-
ticles produce about 250 pairs. The alpha particle track ranges and energy
losses were estimated with the ion range-energy code SRIM [8]. Signals from
the chambers were self triggered and fed into a LeCroy 2249W ADC. The
ADC gate signals had a duration of 2.5 µs for alpha particle irradiation and
1.5 µs for x-rays.

3 Results and discussion

Charge spectra obtained on all three wire diameters with pure iso-C4H10
irradiated with alpha particles, became wider in proportional mode upon in-
crease of high voltage. This could be explained by the wide angle distribution
of alpha particles entering the chamber volume. Further high voltage increase
resulted in the appearance of SQS signals and then a 100% transition from
proportional to SQS mode on all three tested wires. On all 3 wire diameters,
the peaks of the SQS signals on the charge spectra are well separated from the
proportional signals. However, all SQS spectra have tails in the lower portion

of charge spectra, down to the level of the proportional signals. Fig.1 shows
measured charge as a function of applied high voltage on 15, 25 and 50 µm
diameter wires irradiated with the alpha source. Mean values of proportional
and SQS spectra are plotted. The few points in the transition region and above
the mentioned tails in the SQS charge spectra could indicate that SQS signals
had not been fully developed at this voltage range.

Charge spectra from the chamber with a 50 µm wire ﬁlled with pure
iso-C4H10 and irradiated with 55Fe x-ray source do not show any transition
to SQS mode (see ﬁg.1). Our measurements for the chamber with 50 µm wire
ﬁlled with pure iso-C4H10 are consistent both for alpha particles and x-rays
with [7], where a single wire chamber with a similar geometry had been em-
ployed (50 µm wire, cell with 10.5·10.5 mm2 cross-section).

Similar to the pure iso-C4H10, in pure DME with alpha particle irradia-
tion of all three tested wires, the increase of high voltage on the chambers in
the proportional mode at ﬁrst resulted in a widening of the charge spectra.
Further increase of high voltage produced a clear transition from the limited
proportional to SQS mode on a 50 µm wire, resulting in the appearance of
a well separated second peak on the charge spectrum. For a 25 µm wire, a
second peak overlapping the upper portion of the main peak appeared in the
charge spectrum as the chamber high voltage was increased. Upon further in-
crease in high voltage, all signals moved up into the second peak. Observation
of the pulses with an oscilloscope clearly demonstrated that these were SQS

signals. They had shorter width and much higher amplitude than proportional
signals.

Charge spectra on a 15 µm diameter wire do not show any additional
peaks upon increase of high voltage. However, clear SQS signals were ob-
served on an oscilloscope at a high voltage starting at about 2000 V. Fig.2
presents ampliﬁed signals from a 15 µm diameter wire at U=2050 V. The os-
cilloscope scale was conﬁgured to provide details of the proportional signals.
Long proportional and short SQS signals with high amplitude are clearly seen
on the graph.

In order to derive the relative fractions of SQS and proportional signals,
charge spectra have been taken with diﬀerent thresholds in the transition re-
gions for 15 µm and 25 µm wires (low threshold for the total distribution,
high threshold for SQS, and diﬀerential threshold for proportional signals).
Fig.3 presents the total charge spectrum on the 15 µm wire at 2050 V, and
shows the separate contributions of the SQS and proportional signals to the
total spectrum. The charge spectrum of SQS signals overlaps the wider charge
spectrum of proportional signals.

Further increase in high voltage resulted in the appearance of a second
SQS peak on the charge spectra of all wires. This second SQS peak comprises
a small fraction of all events and is well separated from the ﬁrst SQS peak for
all three wires.

Fig.4 presents measured charge versus applied high voltage for all three
wire diameters. Mean values of measured charge spectra for both proportional
and SQS signals are plotted. 25 µm and 50 µm diameter wires have big jumps

in the measured charge when moving from the proportional to SQS mode,
while the 15 µm wire has almost no jump. The jumps are almost the same
magnitude for all three wires when moving from the ﬁrst SQS peak to the
second one.

Further tests revealed that the second SQS peak is due to the develop-
ment of a second SQS discharge along the wire, from alpha particles entering
the chamber volume at big angles, with tracks which are nearly co-planar with
the wire. Fig.5 presents charge spectra taken from the chamber with 15 µm
diameter wire at 2900 V with a 0.5·5 mm2 slot collimator. In ﬁrst case the
collimator slot was placed perpendicular to the wire (dashed line). The second
case presents data for the collimator slot placed parallel to the wire (solid line).
The 148Gd alpha particle source was set at the same height over the chamber
foil as during tests with an aluminum plate hole collimator. The second SQS
peak appears only in the case of a slot collimator parallel to the wire. These
second SQS signals are delayed relative to the ﬁrst ones by a few hundred
nanoseconds and have a smaller amplitude, as shown on ﬁg.6 for 50 µm diam-
eter wire at 3100 V with 50 Ω load. Note that the shortest drift time from the
cathode to wire at this applied voltage, estimated using Garﬁeld [9], is longer
than 800 ns. Also, delayed proportional signals appear initially on the wires

at lower voltages before they transfer into the second SQS discharge as the
voltage is increased.

The source placed over the collimator plate with a 1.2 mm hole emits al-
pha particles with angles up to 37◦ relative to the normal. The alpha particles
entering the chamber at this maximum angle have a track length inside the
chamber about 2.15 mm. The maximum projection of that track on the wire
occurs when they are co-planar, and is equal to about 1.3 mm. Two streamers
developing from these inclined tracks indicate that streamer size along the
wire is less than 1 mm. Moreover, this demonstrates that the wire becomes
sensitive to another discharge, at less than 1 mm distance from the initial
streamer, within about 500 ns, as can be seen on ﬁg.6. The dead zone values,
deﬁned as the product of dead length and dead time, obtained by other au-
thors for noble gas based mixtures [10,11,12], are orders of magnitude bigger
than that observed for DME. This suggest that photons from the excited no-
ble gas atoms play a major role in increasing the streamer size along the wire,
increasing both dead length and especially dead time.

Fig.7 presents the fraction of events in the second SQS peak (sqs2) for
three wire diameters as a function of applied high voltage. For all three wire
diameters, the fraction of events in the second peak reaches a maximum value
at some high voltage and then decreases with further increase of high voltage.
Two processes cause the drop in the fraction of events in the second peak.
Firstly, the dead zone increases as the ﬁrst streamer size increases. Secondly,

particles with a 0.5·5 mm slot collimator. The long side of the
collimator was set perpendicular (dashed line) or parallel (solid
line) to the wire. There is one SQS peak in the ﬁrst case while the
latter has two peaks.

in unsaturated DME gas, the drift time spread of electrons from the track
decreases with increasing high voltage, and becomes comparable to the dead
time. The thinner wire has the highest fraction of events in the second peak
due to having the longest drift time spread at these applied voltages.

Many other authors have observed multi streamer discharges. To our
knowledge, these multistreamer discharges were observed only in noble gas
based mixtures. In those mixtures the new streamers occur due to photons
emitted by the excited noble gas atoms. In the case of a gas photoionization,
the following streamers are indistinguishable in time from the initial ones [10].
When afterpulses appear due to a photoelectric eﬀect on the cathode surface,
the following streamers are separated by electron’s drift time from the cathode
to anode wire [13,14,15].

In our case with DME, the second SQS discharge along the wire occurs
due soley to the initial ionization from the alpha particle tracks. The absence
of second SQS discharges with a 0.5·5 mm2 slot collimator placed perpendic-
ular to the wire (see ﬁg. 5) conﬁrms that photoionization does not play any
role in the formation of SQS discharge in pure DME at these voltages.

A similar behaviour was observed for chambers with 15 µm, 25 µm and

50 µm diameter wires ﬁlled with DME and irradiated with 55Fe x-rays. In-
creasing the chamber high voltage resulted at ﬁrst in the appearance of a tail
on the upper portion of the charge spectra, and then of a second peak over-
lapping that tail. Signals from the ﬁrst peak moved up into the second peak
upon further increase in high voltage. Fig.8 shows these features of the charge
spectra on the 15 µm diameter wire at 2400 V, 2500 V and 2600 V.

Fig.9 shows collected charge from 55Fe irradiaton as a function of high
voltage for all three wire diameters. The data points represent the most prob-
able values of the charge spectra. One can see that the charge characteristics
look similar to the ones obtained by irradiation with an alpha particle source.
However, the curves will have smooth shapes if one plots the mean values of
the total charge spectra. Observation with an oscilloscope did not show clear
diﬀerences between the signals in the two peaks.

The observed charge spectra on all wires irradiated with 55Fe x-rays
could be due to the properties of DME. The widening of charge spectra of
proportional signals upon increase of high voltage on all three wires irradiated
with alpha particles, as shown on ﬁg.3 for 15 µm wire, supports this view.
On the other hand it could be a real transition to SQS mode. The signals in
the two peaks are not distinguished by oscilloscope observation because the
drift time spread of electrons produced in DME by 5.9 keV x-ray ionization is

about 50 ns, which is comparable to the duration of the typical SQS signals.

4 Conclusion

We have studied a transition from a proportional to SQS mode in single
wire chambers with wire diameters 15, 25 and 50 µm, ﬁlled with either pure
DME or iso-C4H10 gases. Chambers were irradiated with 148Gd alpha or 55Fe
x-ray particles.

All three wires demonstrate a 100% transition from proportional to SQS
mode in both gases for the ionization produced by alpha particles. All wires
show a second SQS peak with DME gas with further increase of high voltage.
It was shown that the second peak is due to the inclined tracks allowing a
second SQS discharge to develop along the wire. No second SQS peaks were
observed with iso-C4H10 gas irradiated with the same alpha source.

Double streamer discharges indicate that the wire in pure DME irradi-
ated by alpha particles has much smaller dead length and dead time compared
to those of noble gas based mixtures. The streamer size along the wire is less
than 1 mm. The second SQS discharge occurs at less than 1 mm distance
within approximately 500 ns.

The tests with a slot collimator suggest that in the applied voltage ranges

used, photons do not play any role in SQS formation in pure DME.

10

Charge distributions observed on all three diameter wires with DME ﬁll-
ing irradiated by 55Fe x-rays are not fully understood. Increasing high voltage
resulted ﬁrst in the appearance of a tail on the upper portion of the charge
spectrum, followed by a second peak overlapping that tail. All signals moved
up into the second peak upon further increase of high voltage. This could be
interpreted as a transition from a proportional to SQS mode, however the ob-
servation of signals on the oscilloscope did not provide clear evidence for this
premise.

The observed diﬀerence in charge characteristics of chambers, ﬁlled with
iso-C4H10 and DME and irradiated with alpha particles, are most likely due to
the diﬀerent electron drift velocities in the two gases and as a result, diﬀerent
space charge development dynamics.

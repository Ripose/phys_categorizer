Abstract— The Washington Area Large-scale Time coincidence
Array (WALTA) is placing particle detector arrays in secondary
schools in the Seattle area to build up a large-scale ultra-high
energy cosmic ray detector network, one of several such projects
around the world. Scintillation counters salvaged from the CASA
experiment in cooperation with the CROP group at the University
of Nebraska at Lincoln are refurbished by teachers and students,
tested, calibrated, and installed in four-fold arrays at high school
sites. To identify time coincidences, a GPS time synchronization
system is employed. Data are acquired using a custom low-
cost data acquisition card. Here we will describe the logistics of
WALTA and show samples of data taken with a prototype array
at the University of Washington.

I. INTRODUCTION

P ARTICLE physics groups around the world are starting

outreach programs to place cosmic ray detectors at sec-
ondary schools in order to study extensive air showers. In the
Seattle area, secondary schools are spaced nearly optimally to
detect ultra-high energy air showers which extend for kilome-
ters. The schools are also spread over a large area and might
detect separate, correlated pairs of air showers that are tens
of kilometers apart. With this method, the schools provide the
infrastructure to power the detectors and transfer the data to
a central location, as well as enthusiastic volunteers to set up
and monitor the detectors. In addition to air shower studies, the
equipment is also used by students and teachers for a variety
of elementary experiments and classroom activities.

In development at the University of Washington since 2000,
the WALTA project[1][2][3] now has twenty participating
schools in the Seattle area. Testing of all the pieces of the
experimental apparatus is complete. We will begin taking multi-
site coincidence data during the upcoming school year with the
new GPS-based data acquisition card.

II. ELEMENTS OF THE EXPERIMENT

Each school is provided with the same set of equipment:
four pieces of scintillator, four photo-multiplier tubes, a high
voltage supply, and a data acquisition (DAQ) card with a GPS
unit. The school is responsible for providing boxes to protect
the counters from the weather, space for counters on the rooftop
of their school or another appropriate location, a computer to
collect the data from the card, and internet access to send the
data to the university so it can be searched for coincidences.

The participants may also retrieve data from other sites for
analysis.

The scintillator, photomultiplier tube (PMT), and high volt-
age module were recovered from the CASA experiment[5] in
the Utah desert by members of WALTA and CROP[4]. Our
teachers and students refurbish the equipment, polish the edges
of the scintillator, and with our help remount the PMT. They
re-wrap each unit and test it for light leaks.

Students characterize the counters by looking at the singles
rate as a function of high voltage and threshold settings and
choose appropriate values.

Students and teachers at the schools work either as part of
their regular classroom curriculum or as after-school clubs.
In addition to preparing the apparatus for measurements of
air showers, they perform experiments on other sources of
radiation, electrical interference, and tests of muon event rates.
We invite students and teachers to attend three conferences per
year where they can hear about other physics projects and share
their own measurements with their peers.

A. The scintillator counters

Each piece of scintillator has an area of 0.36 m2 and is
1.27 cm thick. The best choices of high voltage and threshold
typically yield a singles rate near 100 Hz, including both muons
and the background radioactivity. Because our high voltage
modules allow only a single setting, the same for all four
counters at one school, the usual case is that the counter with
the lowest rate operates at 100 Hz and the others are several
times higher.

B. The DAQ card

The counters are read out by an inexpensive DAQ card[6],
shown in Fig. 1 developed with the support of QuarkNet[7] and
in collaboration with engineers at Fermilab and the University
of Nebraska. The user can select none, 2, 3, or 4-fold coinci-
dence and also select the effective gate width from 48 ns to 50
µs, based on the fundamental clock cycle of 24 ns.

When there is a coincidence, the card reports the rising and
falling edges of a discriminator, so it records when the input
pulse goes above and then falls below a threshold voltage. The
time to digital converter chip and its readout circuitry allow
for multi-hit events and we record all edges up to our gate
window – with one limitation – for each coincidence. Each
edge is recorded with ﬁve-bit resolution within this clock cycle
for an actual resolution of 0.75 nanoseconds. The limitation
mentioned above is that this chip can store only the ﬁrst rising
and the ﬁrst falling edge for each 24 nanosecond clock cycle.
Multiple, closely spaced edges will be lost.

TIME BETWEEN RISING EDGES OF TWO-FOLD COINCIDENCES

Fig. 2

This design allows us to measure the relative arrival times
of the particles in the air shower to within 0.75 nanoseconds,
which is sufﬁcient
to estimate the arrival direction of air
showers. We also plan to use the time over threshold to estimate
the particle density, and use the multihit capability to record
the width of the shower front for each coincidence. With this
precision on the card, we are actually limited by the speed of
the PMT’s.

C. The GPS unit

An add-on commercially available GPS unit provides time-
stamps for each coincidence. This is used to match events seen
at one school with particles recorded at other schools. Based
on tests with air shower data and with pulse generators, two
sites can be matched to within 24 nanoseconds in the best case
and 350 nanoseconds in the worst case, depending on the GPS
satellites in view. The GPS unit is modiﬁed slightly for our
use by the manufacturer to provide timing information that is
not normally available in a GPS navigation device. We also
designed a custom connector that allows us to use much longer
cables than we would otherwise. The method is described
in another paper in these proceedings[8]. Accuracy of tens
of nanoseconds is more than sufﬁcient for the reconstruction
of large air showers and can also be used to search for
coincidences with any similar experiment using GPS.

III. THE PROTOTYPE ARRAYS

We have run a prototype site on the rooftop of the physics de-
partment at the University of Washington to test the equipment,
make adjustments to the DAQ card, and to the experimental
design. We have conﬁgured the card to report coincidences
that are two-fold or greater with an effective gate width of
1.2 microseconds. Each of the four channels had a singles
rate between 100 and 500 Hz and the coincidence rate we
observed was around 1 Hz, though this varied with the spatial
conﬁguration of the units. We expect a range of conﬁgurations
for each of our participating schools because they will be

limited by the size and shape of their rooftops; typical spacing
of modules in our tests was 6 meters.

The card was operated with a variety of software: a basic
serial port terminal, a LabView interface for Windows, and a
command-line interface on Linux. We have also developed the
essential software to unpack the encoded data from the card,
test the data for correctness and for proper operation of the
card, and search the data for cosmic ray air shower events and
multi-site coincidences.

IV. PERFORMANCE

The distribution of the difference in rising edge times for
pairs of channels for two-fold coincidences is shown in Fig.
2. Other pairs of channels look similar. The coincidences from
air showers are clearly visible, as is the level of the random
background.

A similar demonstration can be done with three-fold co-
incidences; because there is less random background, the air
showers with hundred nanosecond structure are apparent. We
scan through the same data set for these events during ofﬂine
analysis and order the leading edge times of the pulses. There
are two time differences for each event, one on each axis in the
scatter plot in Fig. 3. As in the previous ﬁgure, 90% of the data
are within 50 ns and are in the lower left corner of the plot.
The backgrounds in this case are symmetric with respect to a
diagonal of slope one, so the excess most clearly seen along
the horizontal axis is due to air showers.

These data conﬁrm our ability to discriminate both the short
and the long time structure of air showers. These structures
are useful for the correlation of ordinary air showers and for
ultra-high energy cosmic rays, respectively.

We received our ﬁrst shipment of cards from the production
run and distributed them during our summer workshop for
teachers in August 2003. At that time we tested the multi-
site coincidence capabilities of the GPS timestamp. We set four

complete arrays on the lawn of the physics building – as if they
were on school rooftops in the Seattle area. One of the arrays
did not operate correctly; we logged 60 coincidences during a
two hour run by requiring at least two of four scintillators in
each of the three working arrays. This test, along with other

tests with pulse generators, conﬁrmed the operation of the GPS
time-matching system.

V. CHALLENGES

Nearly twenty schools have participated in the WALTA
program since it began, shown in Fig. 4. They have prepared
their scintillator modules and have been working with NIM
electronics for the past couple years. Nine schools now have
DAQ cards and are preparing to operate their counters, ﬁrst in
their classroom, and then shortly afterward put their counters
on the rooftops. The array at the University of Washington has
been operating this summer and the ﬁrst school arrays should
be operating by the end of winter. We expect several multi-site
coincidences from ultra-high energy air showers each month
from groups of closely spaced schools. We will also look for
coincidences on city-wide scales and in coordination with other
school-based arrays around the world.

In addition to preparing and maintaining the detectors for
large-area coincidence array, our participants have performed
many small scale experiments on their own as part of their
curriculum. We expect they will want to continue to do this,
and we will be challenged to make the data acquisition software
used to operate the DAQ card ﬂexible enough to allow them to
do other interesting projects.

After these ﬁrst sites are operating well we hope to expand
to other schools in the Seattle and King County area. The area
directly south of the University of Washington site is where

the highest density of schools are, with a spacing of about
one kilometer. Expanding to the rest of King County retains
a reasonable density of schools while extending the total area
covered by this experiment.

The design and testing of the many pieces of the WALTA
experiment are complete. The apparatus meets all speciﬁcations
and has been demonstrated to detect cosmic ray air showers
with very precise particle timing and also provide accurate two-
site event time matching. The software tools are available for
us and for the students, and they are now being used at the
schools.

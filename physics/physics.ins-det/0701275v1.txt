A Monolithic Time Stretcher for Precision Time Recording

Identifying light mesons which contain only up/down quarks (pions) from those containing a
strange quark (kaons) over the typical meter length scales of a particle physics detector requires
instrumentation capable of measuring ﬂight times with a resolution on the order of 20ps. In the last
few years a large number of inexpensive, multi-channel Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) chips have
become available. These devices typically have timing resolution performance in the hundreds of ps
regime. A technique is presented that is a monolithic version of “time stretcher” solution adopted for
the Belle Time-Of-Flight system to address this gap between resolution need and intrinsic multi-hit
TDC performance.

I. BACKGROUND

Particle identiﬁcation in the Belle experiment is
based upon a composite system of subdetectors, as
illustrated in Fig. 1. This hybrid system consists of
ionization loss measurements (dE/dx) in the Cen-
tral Drift Chamber (CDC), Cherenkov light emis-
sion measurement in the barrel and endcap Aerogel
Chernkov Counters (ACC), and ﬂight time measure-
ment in the Time Of Flight (TOF) system. As in-
dicated in the lower section of this ﬁgure, the three
systems work together to cover the momentum range
of interest.

Of these recording systems, the TOF system
makes the most severe demands on time resolution.
Indeed, given the 2ns spacing between RF buckets
(and possible collisions), it is not known at recording
time to which collision a given particle interaction in
the TOF system corresponds.

FIG. 1: Depiction of the composite detector conﬁguration
used by Belle for particle identiﬁcation.

Precision time recording in a very high rate envi-
ronment requires an encoding scheme capable of con-
tinuous recording, with a minimum of deadtime per
logged event. At the time of the construction of the
Belle experiment [1] at the KEK B-factory [2], a de-
cision was made to unify the entire detector readout
(except for the silicon vertex detector) on the LeCroy
1877 Multi-hit TDC Module. This Fastbus module
is based upon the MTD132A ASIC [3], which has
a 0.5ns resolution encoding, comparable to a num-
ber of similar devices [4, 5, 6]. Given the limited
manpower for DAQ system development and main-
tenance, this proved to be a wise choice. The intrin-
sic time resolution was quite adequate for recording
the timing information from the CDC, as well as the
amplitude information (through use of a charge-to-
time converter) for the CDC and ACC.

The challenge then was to be able to record PMT
hits with 20ps resolution, using a multi-hit TDC
having 500ps least count, and for collisions poten-
tially separated by only 2ns. This latter constraint
meant that traditional techniques using a common
start or stop could not be applied, since the bunch
collision of interest was not known at the time at
which the hits need to be recorded. Moreover, in or-
der to avoid incurring additional error due to com-
paring a separate ﬁducial time, it is desirable to di-
rectly reference all time measurements to the accel-
erator RF clock. The solution adopted was a so-
called Time Stretcher circuit, developed by one of
the authors in conjunction with the LeCroy Corpo-
ration [8]. This work built upon valuable lessons
learned in developing a similar recording system for
the Particle Identiﬁcation Detector system of the
CPLEAR experiment [9]. The principle of operation
is seen in Fig. 2. Hits are time-dilated with respect
to the accelerator clock and recorded at coarser reso-
lution, but in direct proportion to the stretch factor
employed. Statistically, by also logging the raw hits,
this stretch factor can be determined from the data.

2

High and low level discriminators are used, with
the high-level used to reject background photon hits
in the TOF and a low-level threshold used to provide
the best possible leading edge timing. The charge
of triggered events is also recorded with a charge
to time (Q-to-T) ASIC, which is recorded with the
same common TDC module. Charge recording is
needed to correct for amplitude dependent timing
eﬀects in the discriminator itself.

II. SUPER B FACTORY

The TOF readout system has worked well for al-
most a decade. Increased luminosity (already 60%
over design) has lead to much higher single channel
rates than had been speciﬁed in the design. From
the beginning, the maximum design speciﬁcation
was 70kHz of single particle interaction rate for each
channel. At this rate the expected ineﬃciency would
be a few percent, comparable to the geometric inef-
ﬁciency (due to cracks between scintillators).

Already the world’s highest luminosity collider,
the KEKB accelerator [2] can now produce in ex-
cess of one million B meson pairs per day. Upgrade
plans call for increasing this luminosity by a factor
of 30-50, providing huge data samples of 3rd genera-
tion quark and lepton decays. Precise interrogation
of Standard Model predictions will be possible, if
a clean operating environment can be maintained.
Extrapolation of current occupancies to this higher
luminosity mandates an upgrade of the readout elec-
tronics. The current system already suﬀers from
signiﬁcant loss of eﬃciency with higher background
rates, as may be seen in Fig. 4.

FIG. 2: Timing diagram illustrating the operating prin-
ciple of the Time Stretcher circuit, as explained in the
text.

As seen in Fig. 2, four timing edges are recorded
for each hit signal. The leading edge corresponds to
the actual output time of the discriminator. This
rising edge is paired with a falling edge, correspond-
ing to the 2nd accelerator reference clock (RF clock
divided by 16) occuring after the initial hit timing.
The interval of interest is then bounded to be be-
tween about 16-32 ns. With a TDC least count of
0.5ns, a factor of twenty time expansion is needed
– the stretch factor.
In the ﬁgure the third edge
corresponds to the time-expanded version of the in-
terval between the rising and falling edges. A beneﬁt
of this technique is that it provides self-calibration.
By recording a large number of events, the stretch
factor can be extracted from the data itself since the
raw and expanded signals are recorded. A 4th edge
is provided, two clock cycles after the 3rd edge, to
provide a return to known state before next pulse.
An obvious drawback in this scheme is that the dead-
time for each hit will be something like 320 - 640ns,
as will be discussed later.

In more detail, the signal chain of the current Belle

TOF electronics [7], is sketched in Fig. 3.

singles rates, which have increased with increased lumi-
nosity, well beyond the 70kHz design speciﬁcation.

III. PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION
IMPROVEMENT

In considering an upgrade to the TOF readout
electronics, it is worthwhile to consider the needs
of an upgraded PID system for Belle. A compara-
tive study of the Belle system, as depicted in Fig. 1,
with that of BaBar [10] PID system is informa-
tive. It is clear in Fig. 5 the Direct Internally Re-
ﬂected Cherenkov (DIRC) detector of BaBar has a
higher eﬃciency and lower fake rate than the hybrid
TOF/ACC scheme used by Belle.

Indeed, it was realized in the construction stage
of Belle that such a DIRC-type detector would have
merits, and prototypes were explored [11]. While
these results were very promising, the schedule risks
led the collaboration to stick with technologies in
which signiﬁcant time and eﬀort had already been
invested.

Thinking about an upgrade, it is reasonable to
revisit the choice of technology. In the intervening
decade, signiﬁcant progress has been made in the de-
velopment of Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) de-
tectors [12, 13], as well as detectors based upon the
arrival time of the Cherenkov photons, such at the
Correlated Cherenkov Timing (CCT) [14] and Time
Of Propagation (TOP) [15] counters.

Because of the great cost encumbered in the
procurement and construction of the CsI crystal
calorimeter, it is planned not to upgrade the barrel
section. As a consequence, the volume available for
the TOF/ACC replacement detector is rather lim-
ited. Therefore a RICH type detector has not been
pursued. The most promising technologies to date
are those illustrated in Fig. 6. The TOP concept
uses timing in place of one of the projected spatial
dimensions to reconstruct the Cherenkov emission
ring. A focusing DIRC is principally using geometry
to reconstruct the Cherenkov ring segments. How-
ever, in this case precision timing is still very useful
for two important reasons. First it allows for the
possibility of using timing to correct for chromatic
dispersion in the emission angle of the Cherenkov
photon. And second, ﬁne timing allows time of ﬂight
to be measured using the quartz radiator bar.

Therefore, in both of the viable detector options
considered, a large number of ﬁne timing resolu-
tion recording channels are required.
In the case
of a ﬁnely segmented focusing DIRC [16] option, the
number of readout channels could be comparable to
that of the current silicon vertex detector. Clearly if
such a detector is to be viable, signiﬁcant integration
of the readout electronics will be essential.

Not shown is a proposal for a multi-segmented
TOF detector consisting of short scintillator bars.
While this option remains viable (and the electron-

3

ics presented would work well with such a system),
the PID performance degradation of such a system
is probably unacceptable. Of the choices listed, the
most attractive in terms of performance is a focus-
ing DIRC detector, if the issues of the photodetector
and readout can be addressed.

Either as an upgrade of only the readout electron-
ics or as a prototype for a higher channel count PID
detector, it is worth considering improvements to the
existing readout.

IV. THE MONOLITHIC TIME STRETCHER

The Time Stretcher technique has worked very
well and Belle has been able to maintain approxi-
mately 100ps resolution performance with the TOF
system. A slow degradation with time is consistent
with loss of light output. Detailed Monte-Carlo sim-
ulation [17] has been able to reproduce much of the
performance of the TOF system and the degrada-
tion is consistent with light loss due to crazing of the
scintillator surface. A larger concern is the signiﬁ-
cant degradation of TOF system performance due to
high hit rates. While the multi-hit TDC is capable
of keeping up with high rates (though the limited
number of recorded edges (16) also leads to ineﬃ-
ciency), by its very nature, the Time Stretcher out-
put can not be signiﬁcantly reduced. Recently, the
clock speed was doubled, to help reduce this eﬀect.
Nevertheless, at ever higher hit rates, the deadtime
leads to ever increasing ineﬃciency.

A logical solution to this problem is to introduce
a device which has buﬀering. Also, while taking the
eﬀort to reduce the deadtime, it makes sense to con-
sider a much more compact form-factor. This was
done with the thought toward moving to a larger
number of readout channels in a future Belle PID
upgrade [18], as mentioned earlier. One proposed so-
lution is the Monolithic Time Stretcher (MTS) chip,
a prototype of which is shown in Fig. 7.

The fundamental logic of the device is identical to

that currently in use with two major changes:

1. High density

2. Multi-hit

High density is achieved by replacing discrete
Emitter-Coupled Logic components on daughter
cards with a full custom integrated circuit. This
higher integration permits having multiple time
stretcher channels for each input. By toggling to
a secondary output channel, the deadtime can be
signiﬁcantly reduced. Once a hit is processed in one
output channel, the next is armed to process a sub-
sequent hit.

hybrid TOF/ACC system; on the right, a similar plot for the BaBar DIRC system. In both cases at lower momentum
the K/π separation is enhanced through the use of drift-chamber dE/dx information. As may be seen, the overall fake
rate is lower and eﬃciency higher for the DIRC.

FIG. 6: Concept ﬁgures of 3 of the Cherenkov ring imaging detectors that have been considered for the Belle detector
upgrade. While simplest, the “Bar TOP” (Time-Of-Propagation) detector has been ruled out due to inadequate
performance. Of the remaining two, the number of instrumented readout channels will depend upon the photodetector
chosen, though will likely require many tens of thousands of readout channels, dictating a monolithic approach.

In Fig. 7 the 8 channel repeating structure of each
time stretcher circuit is clearly seen in the die pho-
tograph. The basics of the time-stretcher circuit are
visible in Fig. 8. A one-shot circuit at the upper left
leads to an immediate output signal, as well as starts
charging current Ihi. Pipelining of the hit signal con-

tinues for two clock cycles after which current Ihi is
switched oﬀ and discharge current Ilo is switched on.
A comparator monitors the voltage induced on the
storage capacitor due to charging and discharging,
providing an output signal to indicate the stretched
time when the voltage is discharged.

In order test the performance of the MTS1, a
multi-hit TDC should be used. As a demonstra-
tion of the power of this time stretching technique,
an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) can
be used as this TDC [21], where the results from
a simple Gray-code counter implementation of the
hit time recording may be seen in Fig. 10. The
RMS of the distribution is about 840ps for the Xilinx
Spartan-3 device used. This resolution could be im-
proved by use of a faster FPGA, though is suﬃcient
to obtain the test results shown below.

Indeed,

it is worth noting that this combined
Time-Stetcher + FPGA technique is very powerful
for two important reasons:

1. low-cost, high-density TDC implementation

2. deep and ﬂexible hit buﬀering and trigger

matching logic

The stretch factor is given by the ratio of the two
currents: SF = Ihi/Ilo. Each input channel of the
MTS1 has two time stretcher circuits, the second
corresponding to the secondary output when the pri-
mary channel is active. Each output is recorded by
a separate TDC channel. With this conﬁguration at
10% deadtime for a single channel of time stretcher
can be reduced to 1%. As the cost of the incremental
cost of additional TDC channels is rather low, it is
possible consider additional buﬀering depths, which
would reduce the deadtime by the dT N , where N
is the buﬀer depth, though that was not explored
beyond a depth of two in this device.

Reduction of cross-talk and Electro-Magnetic In-
terference is enhanced by the use of Low Voltage
Diﬀerential Signalling (LVDS) [20]. MTS1 is fabri-
cated in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corporation 0.35µm CMOS process.

A. Form Factor Reduction

When considering a photodetector with a large
number of channels, the form factor of this device is
very attractive, as shown for comparison in Fig. 9, a
substantial reduction in size has been achieved. On
the left is a 16-channel Fastbus-sized Time Stretcher
card used currently in the Belle experiment. Inset is
a test board with one of the MTS1 packaged devices
for comparison, where a dime has been placed on the
board for scale.

FIG. 9: A form-factor comparison between the current
Fastbus-sized, 16-channel Time Stretcher and the MTS1
chip on a test board. The test board occupies almost the
same space as a single daughtercard channel on the TS
motherboard, and has the same number of channels of
time-stretching as the whole module.

With this level of integration it becomes feasible to
consider integration of the time stretcher and TDC
electronics on detector, as is being done for detector
subsystems in the LHC experiments.

FIG. 10: Timing resolution obtained for the FPGA-based
TDC used in the MTS1 evaluatiton.

A test sweep of the MTS1 input is shown in
Fig. 11, where it should be noted that due to the en-
coding scheme it is only meaningful to scan within a
time expansion clock cycle period. A scan of expan-
sion ratios was performed and the best results were
obtained for stretch factors of 40-50.

As can be seen, there is some non-linearity in the
expanded time. This is more clearly seen when a plot
of the residual distribution is made by subtracting oﬀ
the linear ﬁt, as shown in Fig. 12. A periodic struc-
ture is seen, roughly consistent with the expansion
clock period, if the negative timing dips are corre-
lated to transition edges.

In practice the systematic eﬀects of the upstream
discriminator and its amplitude dependent thresh-
old crossing (and comparator overdrive) dependence
make any further improvements diﬃcult. Never-
theless it is an interesting question for future ex-
ploration. This timing resolution is comparable to
that obtained with the HPTDC after careful non-
linearity calibration.

The broader Gaussian distribution and signiﬁ-
cant non-gaussian tails are correlated with expan-
sion clock feedthrough to the ramping circuit. This
could be improved in a future version with better
layout isolation. The 0.35µm process used only had
3 metal routing layers available and migration to a
ﬁner feature size process would allow for dedicated
shields and better power routing.

2. Multi-hit Buﬀering

In order to reduce deadtime a second time-
stretcher circuit, with a separate output, is provided
for each input channel. This second circuit becomes
armed when the primary stretcher circuit is running.
Use of such a scheme can signiﬁcantly reduce data
loss due to arrival of subsequent hit during operation
of the ﬁrst second. The factor may be expressed as

Fdead = F

N
single

(2)

where N is the number of buﬀer stages. For N=2,
the case prototyped here, a large existing deadtime
of 20% could be reduced to 4%. Moreover, this tech-
nique can be extended to an even larger number of
buﬀer channels, a realistic possibility when using a
low cost FPGA-based TDC. In the case of 4 outputs,
a 20% single time stretcher deadtime would become
a completely negligible 1.6 × 10−3.

1. Timing Resolution

As with the HPTDC device [19] developed at
CERN for the ALICE detector, a ﬁne calibration
is needed to obtain a precision comparable to the
current Belle system. Applying such a calibration,
determined in a separate data set, signiﬁcantly im-
proved linearity and residuals are obtained. The
subsequent results are histogrammed in Fig. 13.

As can be seen, the timing resolution ﬁts well to
a double Gaussian, with a narrow sigma less than
20ps, which is comparable to (and actually slightly
better than) the existing Belle system. This result
is consistent with the expectation from the FPGA
TDC used, where

σTS =

and the measured sigma is about 15ps. It is possi-
ble that a ﬁner resolution FPGA TDC would allow
for an even more precise timing determination.

Apart from the arming circuitry, the second time

The impact of operation of this second channel
is clear during the ramping portion of the readout
cycle, as well as the threshold crossing at the end
of the ramping interval. While this eﬀect can be
calibrated out to some extent, just like eﬀects of the
clock feedthrough, this perturbation to the circuit
would be better mitigated through better isolation
in the IC layout.

V. FUTURE PROSPECTS

An improved layout paired with future, higher
clock frequency FPGAs could open the possibility of
very dense channel count, sub-10ps resolution TDC
recording.

For many applications the HPTDC is perfectly
suitable and gives comparable time resolution to the
MTS1 + FPGA TDC. In both cases a non-linearity
correction is required to obtain this resolution. How-
ever the time encoding itself is only part of the issue
for obtaining excellent timing resolution from a de-
tector output. Correction for time slew in the dis-
criminator threshold crossing is critical. Moreover
the addition of many channels of high-speed discrim-
inator inside a detector is a noise and power concern.
Compact, high-speed waveform recording [22] may
be a promising next evolutionary step in the read-
out of precision timing detectors.

FIG. 14: Cross-check measurement of the secondary
MTS1 output channel, where the results are seen to be
comparable to the primary channel, apart from a system-
atically smaller stretch factor as described in the text.

Note that these secondary channels have a time-
stretch factor that is systematically smaller. As the
same reference currents are mirrored in all channels,
it is believed that this is due to ramp window reduc-
tion due to latency in the arming logic.

An important check of performance of the MTS1
is the impact of time stretcher operation on one
channel while another is operating. This has been
performed in Fig. 15, where the timing of the ﬁrst
channel is ﬁxed and the timing relation of the signal
in channel 2 is varied.

As expected, impact is most sensitive during the initial
current ramping and near stretched time threshold cross-
ing.

The complex a.c. impedance of a bolometer or microcalorimeter detector is easily measured and
can be used to determine thermal time constants, thermal resistances, heat capacities, and sensitiv-
ities. Accurately extracting this information requires an understanding of the electrical and thermal
properties of both the detector and the measurement system. We show that this is a practical
method for measuring parameters in detectors with moderately complex thermal systems.

INTRODUCTION

Thermal detectors are used in a number of ﬁelds rang-
ing from particle physics to astrophysics. The two com-
monly used forms of these detectors are bolometers to
measure incident power and microcalorimeters to mea-
sure total energy. Despite these diﬀerent applications
their construction and operation principles are similar.
In general, they are composed of an absorbing element
to collect incident radiation or particles, a resistive ther-
mometer coupled to the absorber, and a weak thermal
link connecting the thermometer to a heat sink.

The simple model treated in most analytical descrip-
tions consists of a lumped heat capacity connected to a
heat sink through a weak thermal link (Fig. 1a). The
theory predicting the responsivity, noise properties, and
energy resolution of these detectors has been thoroughly
developed.1–4 However, more complex thermal models
are often needed to describe real detectors. The inter-
nal construction of these detectors often introduces ad-
ditional time constants and noise terms which can have
major detrimental eﬀects on performance.5–7

These detectors’ performance can be predicted and
optimized for speciﬁc applications,4,5,8,9 if the thermal
and electrical properties of their components are known.
These properties can be determined from measurements
of the resistance vs. temperature relation, d.c. current-
voltage (IV ) curves, and time constants. The thermal
time constant of a simple detector can be found by mea-
suring its complex a.c. impedance, Z(ω) ≡ dV /dI.2,3 The
heat capacity can then be inferred if the thermal con-
ductivity to the heat sink is also known. In this paper
we show that the internal heat capacities and thermal
conductivities of complex detectors, along with the ther-
mometer temperature sensitivity and thermometer volt-
age (or current) sensitivity can all be determined from
measurements of IV -curves and the detector’s impedance
as a function of frequency.

As examples of this technique we ﬁt impedance data
to the ideal detector model and one of the more com-
plex thermal circuits presented by Galeazzi and McCam-
mon 6. These complex models include electron-phonon
decoupling in the thermometer and a thermal resistance
between the absorber and thermometer. We begin with

weak thermal link, G. b) A more realistic model that includes

a review of the impedance of the simplest detector model
(§II). Section III presents example ﬁts of simple and
complex thermal models to measured impedance data.
In §IV we discuss the eﬀects of stray electrical capaci-
tances and inductances in the bias and readout circuits.
The examples presented here utilize a voltage readout cir-
cuit. However, we show that the equations can be readily
transformed to current readout.

II. THE SIMPLE THERMAL DETECTOR

The simplest, or ideal, detector consists of a sin-
gle lumped heat capacity, C, connected to a heat sink
through a weak thermal link of conductivity G (Figure
1a). This model has been widely discussed by other
authors;1–3,6 we brieﬂy review their results here.

The dynamic impedance for this simple model is given

Z(ω) =

1 − Lv/(1 − βv) + jωτ

For a linear thermometer the resistance is dependent only
on its temperature and βv = 0. However, this is not
generally the case so we will retain the term here.

Equation (1) can be rewritten as

Z(ω) =

Z0 + Z∞
2

+

Z0 − Z∞

1 − jω¯τz
1 + jω¯τz

where

Z∞ ≡ lim
ω→∞

Z(ω) = R/(1 − βv),

Z0 ≡ Z(0) = Z∞

, and

(10)

1 + Lv
1 − Lv/(1 − βv)

¯τz ≡

Z0 + R
Z∞ + R

τ.

Equation (8) describes a semi-circle in the complex plane
2 |Z∞ − Z0| centered on the real axis at 1
of radius 1
2 (Z∞ +
Z0). The frequency at the peak of the circle is given by
the dynamic time constant ¯τz. This time constant is not
the same as the eﬀective time constant which describes
the eﬀect of electro-thermal feedback on the detector re-
sponse and is dependent on the relative resistance values
of the detector and load resistor. The dynamic time con-
stant is a property of the detector only. Equations (8) –
(11) are equivalent to those given by Mather 3.

When αv > 0 (as is the case for a superconduct-
ing transition-edge sensor (TES)) it is possible for the
impedance to become inﬁnite (Lv = 1 − βv in eq. [10]).
To avoid this, one might instead measure the complex
admittance, A(ω) = 1/Z(ω). The relations describing
the admittance are easily found by transforming the pre-
ceding relations using the dual circuit theorem, namely

I ↔ V
(12)
R ↔ S ( ≡ 1/R)
(13)
(14)
Z ↔ A
C (parallel capacitance) ↔ L (series inductance).(15)

Since it is customary to keep α and β as derivatives of
resistance rather than conductance, the signs of these
quantities will change:

The complex admittance is then

A(ω) =

A∞ = S/(1 + βi),

A0 = A∞

1 − Li
1 + Li/(1 + βi)

, and

¯τa =

A0 + S

τ.

With these equations we see that the path a negative
detector (αv < 0) traces through the complex impedance
plane is equivalent to the path traced through the com-
plex admittance plane for a positive detector (αi > 0).

IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS

Figure 2 shows examples of impedance measurements
and ﬁtted models for three diﬀerent microcalorimeter de-
tectors. The ﬁrst example (Figs. 2a, b) is for a doped sil-
icon thermistor with no absorber. The single semi-circle
is adequately represented by equation (8) with the pa-
rameters shown in Table I. The mismatch between the
data and models at high frequency is most likely due to
incomplete modeling of stray capacitances (see §IV). In
the other two examples (Figs. 2c–f) composite absorbers
have been glued to the detectors. The more complex be-
havior of Z(ω) indicates signiﬁcant thermal resistances
which can be reasonably ﬁt by the thermal model of Fig-
ure 1b. The complex impedance for this model is derived
by Galeazzi and McCammon 6 as their equation (110)
(note that they use βi rather than βv).

The complete characterization of these thermal detec-
tors includes the sensitivities of the thermistor, α and β,
and the heat capacities and thermal conductivities of all
constituent parts. However, these parameters cannot be
determined from measurements of the impedance alone.
The impedance of the ideal thermal model is completely
described by the three parameters Z0, Z∞, and ¯τz (eq.
[8]), which are determined by ﬁtting the measured Z(ω).
A d.c. determination of the resistance yields βv, Lv, and
τ through equations (9)–(11). However, αv, C, and G
cannot be separated from Lv and τ without another in-
dependent measurement. For this last measurement we
ﬁt G(T ) to d.c. IV -curves.

The data in Figures 2c-f were ﬁt using the model in
Figure 1b, which separates the detector heat capacity
into contributions from the absorber, Ca, thermistor elec-
trons, Ce, and thermistor phonons, Cp, connected by the

the real and imaginary parts of the detectors’ complex impedance while the ﬁgures on the right (b, d, f) plot the same data

capacitances. Note that the x:y axis ratio is 1:1 in (b), and 2:1 in (d) and (f). For clarity, data above 5 kHz have been removed

labeled thermal conductivities. A complete characteri-
zation requires 8 parameters: the three heat capacities,
the three thermal conductivities, and the two thermome-
ter sensitivities. In principle, this model contains three
separate thermal time constants which could appear as
three separate circles in the complex impedance data. In
practice, the phonon heat capacity in our doped silicon
thermistors is much smaller than either the electron or
absorber heat capacities, placing this third time constant
at frequencies beyond the practical measurement range.
Therefore, we have Cp ≈ 0 and G and Ge can be re-
placed by their series combination (≡ Geﬀ ). The remain-
ing 6 parameters are still perfectly correlated in ﬁts to
the impedance alone so independent measurements are
required to separate them, just as in the ideal model.
The ﬁt parameters for Figures 2c–d are given in Table II.

The procedures outlined above for characterizing ther-
mal detectors contain at least one known systematic er-
ror. The ﬁts of G(T ) to IV -curves assume that βv = 0,
while the impedance ﬁts and resistance measurements
clearly indicate that βv 6= 0. This problem could be al-
leviated using an iterative procedure (re-ﬁtting the IV -
curves with the non-zero βv) or by performing simultane-
ous ﬁts to both the IV -curves and impedance. Without
these corrections the small values of βv measured in the
doped silicon thermometers (|βv| < 0.2) introduce only
a few percent uncertainty in the IV -curve determination
of G(T ). These required corrections may be larger in
TES detectors which can have relatively large values of
βi (≈ 1–3).10

IV. READOUT CIRCUITS

A. The Transfer Function

Figure 3 illustrates two equivalent circuits for biasing
thermal detectors, either of which can be used to mea-
sure the impedance. The ﬁrst (Fig. 3a) utilizes voltage
readout, the other (Fig. 3b) current readout. Our tech-
nique for measuring the dynamic impedance is to add a
small a.c. signal to the d.c. bias and measure the resulting
complex transfer function as a function of frequency. The
transfer functions are deﬁned as T (ω) ≡ Vout(ω)/Vin(ω)
for voltage readout and T (ω) ≡ Iout(ω)/Iin(ω) for cur-
rent readout. The a.c. signal can be either a random noise
source with a bandwidth spanning the frequencies of in-
terest or a sinusoidal source that can be scanned through
the desired frequency range. We use a commercial spec-
trum analyzer to measure the complex transfer function
using both of these methods. The sine-sweep method
could also be implemented with a two-phase lock-in am-
pliﬁer and swept sine generator.

B. Electrical Strays

For an ideal bias circuit the transfer function would
simply be the voltage or current divider formed by RL
and Z(ω).
In practice, additional reactive components
exist in the form of stray capacitances and/or induc-
tances. These stray reactances will introduce additional
phase and amplitude shifts in T (ω), but it is possible to
correct for these eﬀects if the strays in the system can be
accurately modeled and measured.

FIG. 3: Bias circuits for measuring detector transfer functions. Both circuits consist of a thermometer impedance Z(ω),
resistance R, and load resistor RL. a) Voltage readout circuit for doped silicon thermometers. The capacitors connected by
dotted lines are used to model stray capacitances in the system. CL and Ct are shunt capacitances across the load resistor and
thermometer, respectively. The load resistor is one physical resistor, but it has been split in this schematic (RL = RL1 + RL2 )
in order to partially model distributed capacitances, Cb. b) Current readout circuit for TES. The inductors shown as dotted
lines are used to model stray inductances in series with the thermometer, Lt, and load resistor, LL. If Cb = 0 these two circuits
are dual equivalents and all equations describing one system can be transformed to the other system using the substitutions in
equations (12)–(15).

The stray reactances can be determined by measuring
the transfer function of the circuit with the reactive part
of Z(ω) removed. This is done by either replacing the
detector with a pure resistor or by measuring the trans-
fer function of an unbiased (hVini = hIini = 0) detector.
If the unbiased transfer function is measured with a suﬃ-
ciently small a.c. signal, such that the detector dissipates
negligible power (P ≈ 0), then the detector is purely
resistive (see eqs. [1] and [2]). Any observed reactive
component under these conditions must be due to stray
reactances in the circuit.

The dominant reactances in our voltage readout cir-
cuit for silicon detectors are shunt capacitances across
the detector and load resistor (Ct and CL in Fig. 3, re-
spectively). For this model circuit the transfer function
is given by

Equations (26)–(28) can be similarly transformed.

Real strays are complex, involving distributed reac-
tances rather than (or in conjunction with) the simple
parallel capacitances and series inductances discussed
here.
It is the accuracy of the circuit model, not the
values of the circuit elements (both real and stray) that
limits the maximum useful frequency for impedance mea-
surements. This will particularly limit the accuracy with
which Z∞ and βv (or A∞ and βi) can be measured.

No stray inductances have been included in Figure 3a
as they are generally negligible for high-impedance sili-
con detectors. Similarly, the eﬀect of stray capacitances
can be neglected for the very low impedance TES detec-
tors. In this case the stray inductances shown in Figure
3b can be signiﬁcant. However, these stray inductances
still seem to be less of a problem for the low-impedance
detectors than stray capacitances are for high-impedance
detectors. The impedance of a TES can often be mea-
sured up to higher frequencies (tens of kHz)10 than the
silicon detectors (a few kHz).

C. Measuring Stray Capacitances

The shunt capacitance across the silicon detectors is
typically Ct ∼ 10 pF. The load resistors used in the tests
presented in this work are made of nickel-chromium thin
ﬁlm deposited on a thin silicon nitride insulating layer
on a degenerate silicon substrate15. These were found to
have shunt capacitances on the order of CL ∼ 1 pF. We
have recently installed a set of new Nichrome resistors on
quartz substrates15 and measure shunt capacitances an
order of magnitude smaller.

These two shunt capacitances alone are not always suf-
ﬁcient to ﬁt the unbiased transfer functions at high fre-
quencies.
In an eﬀort to better model the distributed
capacitance in the load resistor we have split the resis-
tance into two pieces and added a third shunt capacitor,
Cb (Fig. 3a). Typical values of these additional compo-
nents are Cb <
∼ 1 pF and RL1/RL2 ∼ 1 – 5.
Example ﬁts of an unbiased transfer function are
Including the eﬀects of the stray
shown in Figure 4.
capacitances in ﬁtting the unbiased data should result
in a completely real (resistive) impedance which is in-
dependent of frequency. The lower panel of Figure 4
makes it clear that our simplest stray model (Cb = 0)
accomplishes this only at frequencies below 500 Hz. If we
include the distributed capacitance in the load resistor
(Cb 6= 0) the eﬀects can be removed up to frequencies of
∼ 1 kHz. The remaining deviations above 1 kHz indicate
that our stray models are not an adequate representation
of the real circuit at these frequencies.

D. Biased Transfer Functions

In Figure 5a we measure the transfer function of a bi-
ased detector (dotted lines). Using this transfer function
and the measured values of the load resistor and stray
capacitances we can calculate the impedance of the ther-
mal detector from equation (23) or its equivalent; this
impedance is shown as the dotted lines in Figure 5b.
The best ﬁt to the biased transfer function (solid line
in Fig. 5a) is obtained by varying the detector parame-
ters (i.e. α, β, C’s, G’s) while the strays remain ﬁxed at
their measured values. The impedance for these best ﬁt
detector parameters is shown as the solid lines in Figure

6

FIG. 4: Example of an unbiased transfer function. a) The
measured complex transfer function (diamonds represent ev-
ery tenth data point) and ﬁts to two stray capacitance models
(dotted and dashed lines; Fig. 3a). If no strays were present
the data would follow the solid lines. b) The inferred detec-
tor impedance after correcting for each stray model (dotted
and dashed lines) is compared with an ideal resistor (solid
lines). One model uses only shunt capacitances across the de-
tector and load resistor (Cb = 0) while the other also includes
a distributed capacitance within the load resistor (Cb 6= 0).
The impedance data above 5 kHz have been removed from the
bottom plot for clarity.

5b. As already mentioned in §III, the divergence at high
frequencies is most likely due to inadequate modeling of
the stray capacitances.

V. SUMMARY

We have used the complex a.c. impedance to charac-
terize simple thermal detectors and those of moderately
complex internal construction. Along with independent
measurements of the detectors’ resistance and IV -curves
the impedance is used to determine heat capacities, ther-
mal conductivities, and thermometer temperature and
bias sensitivities. We have previously used this tech-
nique to measure the heat capacity of the electron sys-

7

tem in doped silicon detectors5,11,12 and the heat capac-
ity of several diﬀerent absorber materials (e.g. bismuth,13
mercury-telluride5). Saab et al. 14 and Lindeman et al. 10
have used the impedance to measure heat capacities and
thermometer sensitivities of TES in an eﬀort to under-
stand the physics within the superconducting transition.
The largest sources of systematic uncertainties in ﬁt-
ting the detector parameters to the measured impedance
arise from the model of stray reactances in the bias cir-
cuit. This systematic aﬀects measurements of both high-
impedance silicon detectors and low-impedance TES de-
tectors. However, it appears to be a less severe eﬀect
in TES.
In either case, the uncertainties can be mini-
mized by accurately modeling the circuit and measuring
the strays. This allows the impedance to be measured
to suﬃciently high frequencies, making this a pratical
method for characterizing thermal detectors.

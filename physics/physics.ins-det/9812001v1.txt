Abstract

Polarization characteristics of the gamma beam obtained by the Compton back
scattering of laser photons on high energy electrons are evaluated by Monte-Carlo
simulations. It is assumed that outgoing photons are tagged; the energy dispersion
of the tagging photons and emittance of the initial electrons are taken into account.
Dependence of the ﬁnal photon polarization parameters on measured photon energy
is obtained. It is shown that polarization of ﬁnal photons is decreasing with change
for the worth of the tagging energy resolution. Calculations have been applied for
the storage ring SIBERIA-2 at Kurchatov Institute. The obtained results indicate a
reasonability for construction of gamma-polarimeters on existing and planned facil-
ities for the on-line measurement of the ﬁnal photon beam polarization parameters.

1 Theoretical description of the process of Compton

scattering

Method of obtaining monochromatic and polarized photon beams of high energy and
intensity by the Compton back scattering of laser photon on high-energy electron beam is
widely used in many active and planned facilities [1, 2]. Idea of using the Compton back
scattering of laser photons on relativistic electron beams as source of monochromatic and
polarized gamma - radiation was speciﬁed in works of Harutyunian and Tumanian[3, 4] and
in work of Milborn[5], although polarization phenomenons in this reaction were considered
earlier[6]. Authors[3, 4] used in their evaluations formula for Stoke’s parameters of ﬁnal
photon from monograph[7] which contained unfaithful expression for Stoke’s parameter
ξ(f )
of ﬁnal photon circular polarization. In publishing 1969 of this monograph without

popularity of works [3, 4], casus with parameter ξ(f )
Important element in practical using of considered process is a tagging system, which
allows to measure an energy of outgoing photons. Inﬂuence of this system on polarization
features of ﬁnal photon beam hitherto not explored suﬃciently. The purpose of this work
is the detail analysis of the polarization characteristics of the outgoing photon beam and
studying of inﬂuence on it of the diﬀerent parameters - the electron beam divergence, the
uncertainties in deﬁnition of the outgoing photon energy by tagging of the ﬁnal electrons
and spin characteristics of initial electron beam.

Let’s consider the kinematics of the process, that is shown in Figure 1. In the labo-
ratory frame where axis z coincides with a beam’s axis and x axis belongs to horizontal
plane of accelerator’s beam initial electron with a momentum ~p1 ( polar angle — θ, az-
imuthal angle — ϕ) interacts with a laser photon with a momentum −→k 1 ( polar angle
— θ1, azimuthal angle — ϕ1). Scattered photon has the 3–momentum −→k 2 ( polar angle
— θ2, azimuthal angle — ϕ2). Momentum of the ﬁnal electron −→p 2 is not shown. From
4–momentum conservation law k1 + p1 = k2 + p2 follows (k2 ·

It would be mentioned that in realistic experiment of Compton backscattering of
laser photons when initial relativistic electrons have some angle dispersion there is not
existing one–to–one correspondence between direction of emitting of ﬁnal photon and it’s
polarization characteristics. Actually, photon with deﬁned energy ω2 and angles θ2, ϕ2(see
ﬁgure 1) may be emitted by the whole set of initial electrons that have direction of motion
situated at the surface of cone with corresponding to ω2 angle of opening r.

Corresponding to each such event angle ϕ

is diﬀerent and therefore will be diﬀerent
polarization of emitted photon. Hence, we have to consider only averaged over all possible
events of Compton interaction polarization characteristics of outgoing photon. We should
like to emphasize that for calculation of diﬀerent averaging polarization parameters (for
example

, one has to average values Φi and to build

2 Some details of calculations.

It follows from the previous consideration that the event generator for the Monte-Carlo
simulation of the process of Compton backscattering of laser photon by accelerated elec-
tron beam when outgoing photon beam is tagged and collimated has to consist of following
parts:

1. Generator of random numbers for the values ω2, ϕ

with appropriate distribution;

′

2. Although values which describe direction of initial electron motion, do not enter to
expressions (18) it could eﬀect on distribution of ω2, ϕ
through the condition of
ﬁnal photon passing across the collimator with radius R situated at distance L from
the Compton interaction point:

So we have to include appropriate generator for this values. Distribution of this values
is well known – with a good accuracy it described by the normal distribution with mean
θ(0)
x = θ(0)
- uniformly distributed in the range
[0, 2π], and question about distribution of ω2 requests some discussion. As it is known,
the procedure of tagging of the photons in the process of Compton backscattering of laser
photons on electron beam consists of measuring of energy of the scattered electrons ε2
that is connected with the energy of other taking part in this process particles by the
simple equation ε1 + ω1 = ε2 + ω2. Energy ε1 of initial electron and energy ω1 of laser
photon is known with a high accuracy. Energy ε2 (and therefore - ω2) usually is measured
by the magnet spectrometer with some error. Otherwise speaking, ω2 is random value
that is distributed with some appropriate distribution and result of it’s measuring - value
of mean ω20 of this distribution. Distribution of this value has to be calculated by method
of Monte-Carlo simulation for the cases of correspondent facilities.
In our calculations
should be used such a distributions for the value ω2. But in the calculations of current
article we restrict ourselves by using of the ﬁrst two known moments of such distributions
– the mean ω20 and variance σ2
ω and have approximated distribution of ω2 by the modiﬁed
Gaussian distribution:

From the beginning we should like to consider the case when initial laser photon has pure
circular polarization (ξ(1)
2 = 1.0). Eﬀects of initial electron’s polarization
will not be considered. From equation (18 - 22) one can see that in this case values
Φi do not depend on ϕ
and only source of dispersion of cros section and polarization
of outgoing photon is dispersion of measuring ω2. In the ﬁgure 2 are plotted values of
versus mean ω20 for
outgoing photon averaged circular polarization
the cases when variance σω = 0 and σω = 0.05 ω20. Shown also error bar calculated by
formula (28), N = 106 for each ω20. In the case σω = 0 ﬁnal photon energy is measured
exactly and ω2 = ω20. Corresponding to this case, the curve of polarization dependence
on ω20 could be regarded as theoretical curve for dependence of ﬁnal photon polarization
on energy ω2. One can see that taking into account dispersion of ﬁnal photon energy
measuring σω don’t leads to the increasing of ﬁnal photon polarization dispersion but
causes some systematical deviation in the dependence of averaged Stoke’s parameter on
measured photon energy ω20. This deviation increases when ω20 tends to the maximal
bound ω2maxand attains value about 1.3% for σω = 0.05 ω20.

of errors has been provided with help of equations (28) for N = 106 per each ω20. One can
see that eﬀect of deviation of dependence of ﬁnal photon Stoke’s parameters on ω20 from
theoretical dependence on ω2 (case σω = 0) is observed for the case of linear polarization
too. If σω = 0.05ω20 then maximal deviation attains about 0.7%., and if σω = 0.1 ω20 ,
then maximal deviation is

3.3%.

Mentioned eﬀect points out the necessity of gamma–polarimeter to check the ﬁnal

We investigate the source of large variations in the observed detection eﬃciencies of supercon-
ducting nanowire single-photon detectors between many nominally identical devices. Through both
electrical and optical measurements, we infer that these variations arise from “constrictions:” highly
localized regions of the nanowires where the eﬀective cross-sectional area for superconducting cur-
rent is reduced. These constrictions limit the DC bias current density to well below its critical value
over the remainder of the wire, and thus prevent the detection eﬃciency from reaching the high
values that occur in these devices only when they are biased near the critical current density.

Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors
(SNSPDs) [1, 2, 3, 4] provide access to new regimes in
high-eﬃciency, high-speed single photon counting, with
detection eﬃciencies as high as 57% at 1550nm [2], <30
ps timing resolution [3, 5], and few-ns reset times after a
detection event (for a 3 × 3.3µm active area) [4]. Appli-
cations for these devices already being pursued include
high data-rate interplanetary optical communications [6],
spectroscopy of ultrafast quantum phenomena in biolog-
ical and solid-state physics [7, 8], quantum key distri-
bution (QKD) [9], and noninvasive, high-speed digital
circuit testing [10].

In many of these applications, large arrays of SNSPDs
would be extremely important [5]. For example, exist-
ing SNSPDs have very small active areas, making optical
coupling relatively diﬃcult and ineﬃcient [7, 11]. Their
small size also limits the number of optical modes they
can collect, which is critical in free-space applications
where photons are distributed over many modes, such
as laser communication through the atmosphere (where
turbulence distorts the optical wavefront) and in ﬂuores-
cence detection. Furthermore, it was shown in Ref.
[4]
that the maximum count rate for an individual SNSPD
decreases as its active area is increased, due to its kinetic
inductance, forcing a tradeoﬀ between active area and
high count rates. Count rate limitations are particularly
important in optical communications and QKD, aﬀect-
ing the achievable receiver sensitivity or data rate [6, 12].
Detector arrays could provide a solution to these prob-
lems, giving larger active areas while simultaneously in-
creasing the maximum count rate by distributing the ﬂux
over many smaller (and therefore faster) pixels. Large ar-
rays could also provide spatial and photon-number reso-
lution. Although few-pixel detectors have been demon-
strated [5, 9, 11, 12], fabrication and readout methods
scaleable to large arrays have not yet been discussed.

A ﬁrst step towards producing large arrays of SNSPDs
is to understand (and reduce) the large observed varia-
tion of detection eﬃciencies for nominally identical de-
vices [2], which would set a crippling limit on the yield
of eﬃcient arrays of any technologically interesting size.
In this Letter, we demonstrate that these detection eﬃ-
ciency variations can be understood in terms of what we
call “constrictions:” highly localized, essentially pointlike
regions where the nanowire cross-section is eﬀectively re-
duced, and which are not due to lithographic patterning
errors (line-edge roughness).

The electrical operation of these detectors has been
discussed previously by several authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 13],
so we only summarize it here. The NbN nanowires are
biased with a DC current Ibias slightly below the crit-
ical value IC. An incident photon of suﬃcient energy
can produce a resistive “hotspot” which in turn disrupts
the superconductivity across the wire, producing a series
resistance which then expands in size due to Joule heat-
ing [4, 13]. The series resistance quickly becomes ≫50Ω,
and the current is diverted out of the device and into the
50Ω transmission line connected across it, resulting in a
propagating voltage pulse on the line. The device can
then cool back down into the superconducting state, and
the current through it recovers with the time constant
Lk/50Ω, where Lk is the kinetic inductance [4].

The nanowires were patterned at the shared scanning-
electron-beam-lithography facility in the MIT Research
Laboratory of Electronics using a process described in
Refs. [2, 4, 14], on ultrathin (∼ 5 nm) NbN ﬁlms grown
at Moscow State Pedagogical University [15]. The wires
were 50-90 nm wide, 50 µm long, and were fabricated in
a meander pattern subtending an active area of 3 × 3.3
µm [2, 4]. The devices had critical temperatures TC ∼
9 − 10 K, and critical current densities JC ∼ 5 × 1010
A/m2 at T = 1.8K.

FIG. 1: (color online) Variations in SNSPD detection eﬃ-
ciency. (a) Histogram of the DEs measured for 132 devices
from a single fabrication run, on a single chip. The devices
were 3 × 3.3 µm in size, and composed of a 50 µm long
nanowire in a meander pattern with 45% ﬁll factor. The
measurements were made at T = 1.8K, and Ibias = 0.975I obs
C .
Note that the peak DE of 22% increases to 57% with the
addition of an optical cavity, as described in Ref.
[2] (b)
Measurements of the DE vs. Ibias/I obs
C for a selection of these
devices.

The experiments were performed at MIT Lincoln Lab-
oratory, using the procedures and apparatus discussed in
detail in Refs. [2, 4]. Brieﬂy, the devices were cooled to
as low as 1.8 K inside a cryogenic probing station. Elec-
trical contact was established using a cooled 50 Ω mi-
crowave probe attached to a micromanipulator, and con-
nected via coaxial cable to the room-temperature elec-
tronics. We counted electrical pulses from the detectors
using low-noise ampliﬁers and a gated pulse counter. To
optically probe the devices, we used a 1550 nm mode-
locked ﬁber laser (with a 10 MHz pulse repetition rate
and ≤1 ps pulse duration) that was attenuated and sent
into the probing station via an optical ﬁber. The devices
were illuminated from the back (through the sapphire
substrate) using a lens attached to the end of the ﬁber
which was mounted to an automated micromanipulator.
The focal spot had a measured e−2 radius of ∼ 25 µm.
Figure 1 illustrates the detection eﬃciency (DE) vari-
ations observed on a single chip of 132 devices of the
same geometry, fabricated in a single run. These devices
are the same ones reported in Ref. [2] before the optical
cavities were added (maximum DE after the addition of
cavities was 57%). In panel (a) we show a histogram of
the measured detection eﬃciencies at Ibias = 0.975I obs
(where I obs
is the observed critical current of each de-
vice), and (b) shows some representative data of the ob-
served DE as a function of Ibias/I obs
C . Note that the shape
of these curves also varies signiﬁcantly. As we show be-
low, these data can be explained with the hypothesis,
ﬁrst suggested in Ref. [16], that some devices have “con-
strictions:” regions where the (superconducting) cross-
sectional area Acs of the wire is reduced by a factor we
label C. This eﬀectively reduces the observed critical
current by that same factor (I obs
C = JCAcsC = ICC),
and prevents the current density everywhere but near the

vs. Ibias data. (a) Universal DE curves, for T = 1.8K (•)
and T = 4.2K (+). Data from 170 devices distributed over
two separate fabrication runs is shown superposed. By rescal-
ing the I obs
C of each device such that all data lies on a single
universal curve as shown, the constriction C (which indicates
the fraction of the wire’s cross-sectional area that is supercon-
ducting at the constricted point) can be obtained. Also shown
(◦) are data for 15 devices having 54 nm wide wires (and 33%
ﬁll factor) at T = 1.8K, indicating that narrower wires exhibit
a very diﬀerent universal curve shape. These data provide ev-
idence for the localized nature of the constrictions, since any
appreciably long section of wire having a smaller cross-section
should signiﬁcantly alter the shape of the curves, making it
impossible to superpose them as shown. This is illustrated
by the dashed line, which is a simple prediction (based on the
data shown) for a 90 nm wide wire with a 54 nm wide, 0.5 µm
long constriction. (b) and (c) Constriction values C obtained

scribed below (see Fig. 3). The solid lines are straight lines

constriction from ever approaching the critical value (and
hence prevents the wire from having a high DE except
locally near the constriction).

If all the nanowires were identical in all dimensions
save for a pointlike constriction, we would expect that if
the data of Fig. 1(b) were plotted vs. absolute current
Ibias (rather than Ibias/I obs
C ) it would all lie on a single,
universal curve, with the data for more constricted de-
vices simply not extending to as high currents. This turns
out to be approximately true, but slow variations from
device to device across the chip either in ﬁlm thickness
or in the nanowire width obscure the essential feature of
the data that we wish to illustrate when it is plotted in
this simple way. Instead, we present our results as shown
In panel (a), the DE data for each of 170

devices (across two chips fabricated in separate runs) is
shown superposed (ﬁlled circles indicate T = 1.8K, and
crosses T = 4.2K). All of the data for each temperature
can be made to lie on a single universal curve by scaling
the critical current I obs
C for each device by an adjustable
factor (which is just 1/C: IC = I obs
C /C). The very fact
that data from this many devices can be so well super-
posed is already suggestive of a universal shape. How-

ever, we can now take the C value for each device ex-
tracted using this scaling procedure and cross-check it.
Based on our previous discussion, if all wires were identi-
cal save for constrictions, we would expect C = I obs
C /IC,
i.e. C to be exactly proportional to I obs
C . Due to the
slow variations across a chip this is only partially true,
as discussed above. However, we can normalize out these
variations using a very simple method:
instead of com-
paring C directly to I obs
C , we instead compare it to the
product I obs
C Rn = (C × JCAcs)(ρnl/Acs) = C × JCρnl,
where Acs and Rn are the cross-sectional area and room-
temperature resistance of each nanowire, JC and ρn are
the critical current density and room-temperature resis-
tivity of NbN, respectively, and l is the total wire length.
This product depends on the wire geometry only through
l (which is ﬁxed lithographically and does not vary appre-
ciably between devices) and not on each wire’s individual
Acs. Figure 2(b) shows a comparison between the C val-
ues extracted from the data in Fig. 2(a) and the I obs
C Rn
product. The data lie on a straight line through the ori-
gin, indicating that these two independent measures of
C are mutually self-consistent.

Our data can also be used to infer that the constric-
tions are essentially pointlike (i.e. very short in length).
The open circles in Fig. 2(a) are data for 15 devices with
a ∼54 nm wire width, and clearly show a dramatically
diﬀerent shape (i.e. high DE persists to much lower cur-
rents than for the wider wires). The broken lines are
estimates, based on the data for 90 nm and 54 nm wide
wires, of what one would expect for a device having 90
nm wide wire, except at a single constriction 54 nm wide
(corresponding to C ∼ 0.6) with a length of either 0.5
µm (dashed line) or 50 nm (dotted line) long. These
curves have a diﬀerent shape from the data for 90 nm
wide wires, which occurs because at low currents the DE
is dominated by the region of wire near the constriction,
while at higher current it becomes dominated by the con-
tribution from the rest of the wire length. This type of
very diﬀerent shape should be distinguishable if it were
present, and should prevent the data from being super-
posed onto a single curve. The absence of this in our data
at any level above the noise indicates that the constricted
regions are likely much shorter than ∼0.5µm.

So far, we have in fact only addressed constriction in
a relative sense; that is, we have no way to tell if our
best devices in fact have C = 1. To address this, we can
exploit the known dependence of the kinetic inductance
on bias current. Kinetic inductance arises from energy
stored in the eﬀectively ballistic motion of cooper pairs;
as we increase the current density towards the critical
value, the density of cooper pairs is depleted, forcing the
remaining cooper pairs to speed up (and hence store more
kinetic energy per unit volume) to maintain the current.
Hence, the kinetic inductance increases as J → JC [17].
Since the kinetic inductivity locally increases with J/JC,
the total kinetic inductance of the wire provides a way to
determine if the current density is indeed near the crit-
ical value over the whole wire or only at one localized

FIG. 3: (color online) Absolute measurement of constriction
using bias current-dependence of kinetic inductance. The ki-
netic inductance of our nanowires should increase with Ibias,
due to the depletion of the cooper-pair density near the crit-
ical current density (solid line). A detector with the high-
est observed detection eﬃciency (22%) behaves as expected
(•), with no free parameters. However, a detector with much
lower DE (0.1%) does not (△). This is due to a constriction,
which prevents the current density from approaching critical
anywhere but near this one localized point. The inset shows
the inductance ratio RL ≡ L(I0 ≈ 0.9I obs
C )/L(0) measured
for each device, plotted vs. I0/(I obs
C /C) = I0/IC, where C
is obtained from the I obs
C Rn product. These data agree with
the prediction, indicating that RL and I obs
C Rn give mutually
consistent results for the constriction.

place. We measured the inductance of our nanowires
using a network analyzer, by observing the phase of a re-
ﬂected microwave signal as a function of frequency. We
then ﬁt this data using a suitable electrical model to ex-
tract the inductance value. A bias tee was inserted into
the signal path to superpose the desired Ibias with the
network analyzer output. The phase contributions from
the coaxial cable, bias tee, and microwave probe were re-
moved by probing an in situ microwave calibration stan-
dard (GGB Industries CS-5). The microwave power used
in this measurement corresponds to a peak current am-
plitude of ≤ 0.5µA, and the critical current measured in
the presence of the microwaves was within 10% of that
measured in their absence (∼ 20µA for typical devices at
T = 1.8K).

In Fig. 3, we show the measured inductance vs. cur-
rent of two devices; one which has nearly the highest de-
tection eﬃciency observed (22% - ﬁlled circles), and the
other having one of the lowest (0.1% - ﬁlled triangles).
Also shown is the prediction for Lk(Ibias) from Ginsburg-
Landau theory (see, e.g., [17]), with no free parameters
(solid line). The data for the high-DE device show good
agreement this prediction, indicating that this device is
indeed unconstricted. However, for the low-DE device
the inductance does not increase as much as the theory
predicts, which is precisely what we would expect within
the constriction hypothesis; the current density is only
near critical at one localized place (which constitutes a
negligible fraction of the total wire length) whereas ev-

4

erywhere else the current density is lower, producing a
smaller increase in inductance. This constitutes an ab-
solute measurement of the constriction, and allows us to
correctly normalize the C values obtained using the pre-
vious methods described above (see Fig. 2).

We can also verify that the observed Lk(Ibias) and
I obs
C Rn product give mutually consistent results. To
check this, for each device we measured the inductance
ratio RL ≡ L(I0)/L(0), where I0 ≈ 0.9I obs
C . Using the
C obtained from the normalized I obs
C Rn product, we also
obtain I0/IC = I0C/I obs
C for each device. The inset to
Fig. 3 shows RL vs. I0/IC, and the data are in rea-
sonable agreement with the Ginsburg-Landau prediction
(solid line).

In addition to providing evidence for the constriction
hypothesis, the measurement of Lk(Ibias) and I obs
C Rn pro-
vide a powerful diagnostic tool, since these constitute a
purely electrical measurement of the constriction, which
can then be used to predict the detection eﬃciency. Since
optical testing of large numbers of detectors is signiﬁ-
cantly more diﬃcult than electrical testing, this is poten-
tially an important screening technique for large arrays.
As a ﬁnal note, we remark on the obvious question
of the origin of these constrictions. The most natural

explanation would be lithographic patterning errors; for
example, a small particle or defect in the resist before ex-
posure could result in a localized narrow section of wire.
However, we have performed extensive scanning electron
microscopy of devices that were measured to be severely
constricted (e.g. C ∼ 0.5) and no such errors were ob-
servable. This suggests that constrictions in our devices
result either from thickness variations or material defects,
which may even have been present in the ﬁlm before pat-
terning.

In conclusion, we have veriﬁed both optically and elec-
trically that the large variations in detection eﬃciency
between nominally identical superconducting nanowire
single photon detectors are the result of localized con-
strictions which limit the device current. Further work is
ongoing to pin down the exact source of these constric-
tions, with the hope of eventually fabricating large arrays
of these detectors.

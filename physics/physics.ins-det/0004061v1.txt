STUDY OF NUCLEATING EFFICIENCY OF
SUPERHEATED DROPLETS BY NEUTRONS

Superheated droplets have proven to be excellent detectors for neutrons and
could be used as a neutron dosimeter. To detect accurately the volume of superheated
droplets nucleated, an air displacement system has been developed. Here the air
expelled due to volume change upon nucleation displaces a column of water through
a narrow horizontal glass tube, and, the displacement of water is linearly related to
the nucleated volume and has the added advantage of being leak free.

In presence of neutrons, the rate of nucleation (rate of decrease in the volume of
superheated droplets) is proportional to the residual volume of superheated droplets
and the neutron ﬂux (φ). Hence the volume of accumulated vapour (or the volume
of the displaced air) is given as:

V = V0 (cid:16)1 − e−t/τ(cid:17)

(1)

where τ = M/(φρηNA d P niσi), M is the molecular weight and ρ is the density of the
superheated liquid, NA is the Avogadro number, ni is the abundance of the ith species
of nucleon (whose neutron elastic scattering cross section is σi) in the molecule, η is
the eﬃciency of nucleation of the droplet by a recoil nucleon, d is the average droplet
volume and V0 is the volume of vapour of the entire superheated liquid. By least
squares ﬁtting of the volume of displaced air (V) as a function of time (t), V0 and τ
are obtained. From τ one may obtain η if the other parameters are known. Results
of an experiment performed with Freon- 12 samples using an Am-Be neutron source
are presented in Fig. 1.

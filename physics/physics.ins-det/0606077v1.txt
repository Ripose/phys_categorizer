Introdution

Reently photoneutron prodution ross setions on a range of nulei [1℄ have

been measured in the energy region 11-30 MeV at the high-duty-fator, tagged-

photon faility of MAX-lab [2℄ in Lund, Sweden. The purpose is to test al-

ulations of neutron dose reeived during the ourse of bremsstrahlung ra-

diotherapy [3℄. In these time-of-(cid:29)ight (TOF) experiments, at relatively low

kineti energy (Tn ), the neutron signal is obsured by an aelerator-indued

room bakground and a high rate of random-oinidene events produed by

untagged photons inident on the experimental target. The bulk of this bak-

ground arises from deteted photons, so that good partile identi(cid:28)ation is

required to aess Tn ∼ 1 MeV, where both the photoprodution ross setion

and the biologial e(cid:27)etiveness of neutrons are at a maximum. The MAX-lab

liquid sintillator array Nordball [4℄, with good n/γ pulse shape disrimina-
∼ 1 ns (FWHM) time resolution, was used for

tion (PSD) properties and

these measurements. This paper presents Nordball alibration proedures and

a omputer model used to evaluate systemati e(cid:27)ets whih distort the mea-

sured neutron yield.

At low energies neutron attenuation and multiple sattering e(cid:27)ets on mea-

sured neutron yields are large. Thus a simulation of the experiment based

on GEANT-3 [5℄, whih models neutron interations in all materials in the

viinity of the detetor array, has been developed to orret for these e(cid:27)ets.

The non-linear pulse-height response of the sintillators to low energy reoil

protons has a ritial bearing on these alulations, espeially lose to thresh-

252

old, and so this was measured with a white

Cf neutron soure. This is a

alibration standard sine the neutron yield from spontaneous (cid:28)ssion (deay

branhing ratio 3.1%) is high and both the absolute numbers and energy spe-

trum of prompt neutrons per (cid:28)ssion are well known [6,7℄. Neutron detetor

response may be obtained in a TOF measurement if (cid:28)ssion events are tagged

by detetion of at least one heavy fragment, whih provides a time referene.

Although (cid:28)ssion hambers [8℄ are possibly the optimal detetors for fragment

detetion, a simple thin-(cid:28)lm organi sintillator presented a viable, available

alternative at the time of the measurement. This type of detetor has several

desirable properties:

(1) Insensitivity to γ -rays or neutrons as the plasti is extremely thin.

(2) Fast response with a similar time resolution to Nordball, whih also gives

high ounting rate apability.

(3) Fast, heap prodution.

Here we ompare the measured and simulated (cid:28)ssion-neutron response of the

Nordball array and desribe a test of the simulation by measurement of the

well known

2H (γ, n) p ross setion. Here the simulations have been used to

ompute the large attenuation and multiple sattering orretions, as well as

the neutron detetion e(cid:30)ieny. Se. 2 gives an overview of the experimental

setup, the measured Nordball response is presented in Se. 3, the Monte Carlo

(MC) simulation is desribed in Se. 4, measurements and simulations are

ompared in Se. 5, and a short summary is given in Se. 6.

2 The time-of-(cid:29)ight experiment

2.1 The Nordbal l array

The Nordball detetor (Fig. 1) onsists of 16 liquid sintillators, type Biron

BC-501, with PSD apability. Ten detetors are of hexagonal ross setion and

six detetors of pentagonal ross setion. Their respetive volumes are 3.3 l and

2.6 l at a ommon thikness of 16 m. The liquid is ontained within a 2 mm

thik, stainless steel annister, oated on its inner surfae with TiO2 re(cid:29)etive

paint. This is onneted to a 5 in. XP2041 photomultiplier tube (PMT) via

a Pyrex glass window. A ylinder of µ-metal shields the PMT from stray

magneti (cid:28)elds and an outer plasti housing enases tube and voltage-divider

iruit, whih provides a negative anode signal.

All detetors were mounted on aluminium frames and plaed on a 32 m thik

layer of borated para(cid:30)n, supported by an iron table. The on(cid:28)guration of

◦

Fig. 1 onsisted of (cid:28)ve detetor olumns, positioned in 15

steps, at a distane

of 150 m from the entral position where the experimental target or the

(cid:28)ssion detetor was loated. The bigger hexagonal detetors were plaed in

the two bottom rows, (cid:28)ve pentagonal detetors in the third, and the last one

on top of the entral olumn. Para(cid:30)n towers to both sides of the iron table

partially shielded the array against regions of strong neutron bakground.

For the deuteron photodisintegration experiment a 40 × 40 × 1.8 m plasti

sintillator sheet was inserted between the target and Nordball to identify

harged partile events.

2.2 Fission detetor

The thin-(cid:28)lm sintillator was prepared following Ref. [9℄. A solution of plasti

sintillator in xylene was spread uniformly over the glass window of a 2 in.

PMT (Philips XP2262B) whih was plaed upright in a vauum hamber.

Slow evauation of the hamber auses solvents to evaporate and a thin layer

of sintillating material remains on the glass. Its thikness was tuned, by vary-

ing the amount of plasti in the solution, to optimise disrimination between

(cid:28)ssion fragments and the 30 times more numerous α partiles.

The (cid:28)ssion soure [10℄ onsists of a platinum-lad, nikel disk, on to whih

2
Cf2O3 was eletro-deposited. The ative area (0.2 m

) is overed by a 50 µg/m

2

layer of gold allowing the passage of (cid:28)ssion fragments with relatively small en-

ergy loss. The soure was plaed on the entre of the sintillating (cid:28)lm and

the PMT was sealed with a plasti ap, lined with aluminised mylar foil, to

exlude external light and provide some re(cid:29)etion of sintillation light. The

(cid:28)ssion detetor was positioned so that the soure sat at the target-entre po-

sition (Fig. 1) at the same height as the middle of the seond Nordball row

and the photon beam axis.

∼ 10◦

The axis of the PMT was o(cid:27)set

from vertial. Apart from the bottom

row of the array, this o(cid:27)set avoided (cid:28)ssion neutrons having to pass through

the glass of the PMT on the way to the Nordball detetors. Plaing the PMT

horizontally would have displaed the loose soure from the ative area of the

PMT fae. As a onsequene of attenuation in glass, the deteted neutron yield

in the bottom detetors was found to be about 15% smaller at low energies

where the interation ross setion is highest. These losses are onsistent with

the preditions of a omputer model of the experiment (Se. 4.2) whih ap-

proximated the PMT by a 2 mm thik glass ylinder and alulated for tilting

angles in the range of 5(cid:21)15 degrees. However the angle was not su(cid:30)iently

well determined to enable quantitative omparisons and hene the bottom de-

tetors were exluded from the analysis of di(cid:27)erential and absolute neutron

detetion e(cid:30)ienies presented in Se. 5.

No suppression of bottom-row neutron yield was observed in the deuteron

porting the assumption of inreased neutron attenuation in glass during the

252

Cf measurement.

Fig. 2 shows the fragment pulse-height distribution obtained from the

Cf

∼ 3 kHz. With

∼ 2π aeptane for

252

soure, whih produed a ounting rate of

harged partile detetion, the e(cid:27)etive thikness of the sintillator depended

on emission angle and not all 6.11 MeV α partiles ould be separated from
heavy fragments by pulse height. A small fration of α partiles had to be

aepted in the trigger, resulting in the sharp spike observed around hannel

250. These events are ompletely unorrelated with any deteted neutron,

on(cid:28)rming that they are not produed by (cid:28)ssion fragments. The two broad

distributions represent interations of heavy and light (cid:28)ssion fragments, with

∼
10% of the former lost, judging from the width of the peak. An estimate of the

resulting distortion of the neutron spetrum was based on Ref. [6℄ where the

shapes of the neutron energy distributions and the mean numbers of emitted

neutrons per (cid:28)ssion event for light (1.97) and heavy (1.70) fragments are

presented. The distortion in the neutron spetrum is below 2%, and the mean

number of neutrons ν is redued by 5.4%. No signi(cid:28)ant deviations from this

simple estimate were observed when measured neutron spetra, orresponding

to di(cid:27)erent regions in the (cid:28)ssion pulse-height distribution, were ompared.

However rather than attempt a more sophistiated orretion we have fatored

these distortion e(cid:27)ets into the systemati unertainties assoiated with the

evaluation of the

Cf (cid:28)ssion neutron yield [7℄.

252

2.3 Eletronis

The layout of the eletronis is shown in Fig. 3 and the data aquisition and

analysis system ACQU is desribed in Ref. [11℄. Analogue to digital onverters

(ADC) and salers were read out by a VMEbus single board omputer via the

CAMAC bus and a VMEbus CAMAC parallel branh driver (CBD). During

readout the event lath prevented further triggers until reset at the end of the

event.

252

The experimental trigger for the

Cf measurement was made by the onstant-

fration disriminator (CFD) of the (cid:28)ssion detetor. The number of triggers

was reorded by a saler for normalisation purposes and the (cid:28)ssion pulse height

was reorded in a harge-integrating ADC (QDC). Gate and start signals for

the various ADCs were derived from the trigger. The anode signal of eah

Nordball sintillator was split 3 ways and fed to:

(1) a QDC to reord the pulse amplitude.

(2) a CFD onneted to a time to digital onverter (TDC) to reord the time

of (cid:29)ight to the sintillator.

3 Nordball Performane

3.1 Pulse-height alibration

The light output from the Nordball detetors was alibrated with the γ -ray
228Th, and Pu/Be. Following Ref. [13℄, the edges of the resulting

60Co,

soures

Compton eletron spetra were initially assumed to be the hannels ontaining

90% of the ounts in the peaks in the Compton end-point pulse-height distri-

butions. However this proedure may be over simplisti as the Compton edge

position depends on the resolution of the detetion system under onsideration.

In Ref. [14℄ an empirial formula was determined to estimate the resolution

from measured pulse-height spetra and tables of resolution-dependent Comp-

ton edge positions, relative to the hannel of maximum ounts, were produed.

These tables were heked using the present GEANT-3 simulation (Se. 4),

whih reprodued the result for both Nordball and the detetor geometries of

Ref. [14℄. However the simple approximation of Ref. [13℄ does not deviate from

Ref. [14℄ by more than 3%.

The pulse-height resolution (FWHM) of the Nordball array was parameterised

[14℄, in terms of sintillation light output L in units of eletron energy equiv-

alent (MeVee), as:

∆L
L

= qα2 + β2/L + γ2/L2

(1)

Small non-linearities in the low energy eletron response [15℄ were negleted.

Sine the individual detetor responses were very similar, they were summed

before least-squares (cid:28)tting to obtain the average response of the Nordball

7

g
array. Parameter values of α = 3.2 ±
with γ (cid:28)xed at zero and this resolution funtion was implemented in the MC

10 % and β = 10.9 ±

5 % were obtained

simulation. The obtained values are similar to those of Ref. [16,17,18℄.

3.2 Partile identi(cid:28)ation

Pulse shape disrimination (Fig. 4) was applied to separate deteted neutrons

and photons. To quantify neutron and photon regions, two-Gaussian (cid:28)ts were

made to pulse shape pro jetions generated for 50 keVee-wide pulse-height bins,

yielding peak positions and widths for eah distribution. Intervals of

±3σ

around the peak positions de(cid:28)ned the neutron or photon region limits at a

given pulse height and straight-line (cid:28)ts to these limits de(cid:28)ned the boundaries

of the neutron/photon regions of the pulse shape plot. Neutron events below

the dashed line of Fig. 4 have some photon ontamination at pulse heights

below

∼ 1 MeVee.

3.3 The neutron pulse-height response funtion

The non-linear sintillation response to reoil protons is vital input to a neu-

tron e(cid:30)ieny simulation and must be measured to avoid large systemati

errors lose to detetion threshold. Using TOF information, neutron events

were divided into 625 keV-wide kineti-energy bins in the range 1.25 < Tn <
10 MeV. The resulting pulse-height spetra for eah detetor were summed to
produe the overall response of the array. For eah value of Tn the maximum
proton reoil energy was determined from the half-height position C1/2 (Tn ),
orreted by a multipliative fator C(Tn) to aount for multiple neutron

interations in the sintillators.

Numerial values for C(Tn) were derived from the MC simulation (Se. 4.1),

whih mimis the 625 keV neutron energy bins used in the data analysis.

A pulse-height distribution for 5 MeV neutrons is shown in Fig. 5. The half-

height position C1/2 at 1.85 MeVee underestimates the expeted light output of

2.03 MeVee for maximum-energy reoil protons, alulated from the sintillator

response funtion. This leads to a orretion fator C(Tn) = 1.10 at 5 MeV,
while for 2 MeV neutrons C(Tn) = 1.22. A 2nd-order polynomial (cid:28)t to the
MC alulations in the range Tn = 1.25 − 10 MeV yielded:

C(Tn) = 1.335 − 0.067 · Tn + 0.004 · T 2

The proton response funtions obtained with ((cid:28)lled irles) and without (empty

irles) the orretion fators are shown in Fig. 6. The symbol size is equivalent

to the 50 keVee unertainty of the half-height position C1/2 , estimated from

variations in the spline funtions whih (cid:28)tted the edge regions of the pulse-

of individual detetors showed no signi(cid:28)ant deviations and a ommon light

output funtion for the Nordball array was implemented in the MC simulation.

traking methods from the STANTON ode [20,19℄ have been inorporated.

This oupled approah allows the use of the GEANT-3 neutron ross setion

data base (pakage GCALOR [21℄ based on ENDF/B-6 [22℄) at Tn <20 MeV
and STANTON proedures for 20 < Tn < 500 MeV, where the latter provides

a more detailed and aurate representation of neutron interations ompared

to standard GEANT-3.

The (cid:29)exible geometry framework of the MC simulation allowed omparison of

preditions with a broad range of published neutron response measurements.

The ore of the simulation, inluding the neutron traking routines of Ref.

[19℄, remained unhanged. After benhmark omparisons whih reprodued a

variety of published neutron e(cid:30)ieny measurements [23,24,25℄, the MC ode

11

was applied to Nordball (Se. 5.1,5.2).

4.2 The oupled GEANT3-STANTON ode

The geometry and materials of a partiular experiment (Fig. 1) an be de-

sribed in (cid:28)ne detail using GEANT-3 but, designed primarily for high energy

physis, this fails to model low energy neutron interations aurately. How-

ever, with the addition of the GCALOR pakage the GEANT-3 desription

of Tn < 20 MeV neutron interations is quite aurate due to the use of re-

ent Evaluated Nulear Data Files. These (cid:28)les ontain neutron partial ross

setions, angular distributions and seondary energy distributions evaluated

on a grid of disrete energy and angle points, for elements over the full range

of the periodi table. This is neessary as few-MeV neutron ross setions are

large and strongly dependent on energy and target mass. Any realisti model

requires onsideration not only of neutron interations within the detetor

volume, but also of attenuation and multiple sattering e(cid:27)ets in all bulk ma-

terials in the loality of the detetor. At higher energy suh e(cid:27)ets beome

less important, but none the less it remains important to model interations

in the detetor volume as aurately as possible.

The present implementation of GEANT-3 inorporates STANTON methods

as a subroutine whih traks neutrons inside the organi-sintillator dete-

tor volumes, while GCALOR is used for interations outside the detetor

volume. The geometry of all omponents onsidered in the simulation, and

hene alulation of volume boundaries, is ontrolled entirely by the GEANT-

3 traking system. Original STANTON geometry funtions were replaed by

the GEANT-3 subroutine gmedia, whih may be tailored to handle pentagonal

and hexagonal shaped detetors in a straightforward way.

A test of the simulation is desribed in Se. 5.3, where it has been used to

alulate systemati orretions to a measurement of the well known, two-body

deuteron photodisintegration ross setion.

Cf measurement

252

5.1 Di(cid:27)erential detetion e(cid:30)ieny

Normalised pulse-height spetra were sorted into inident neutron energy bins

of 0.5 MeV width and ompared to the MC preditions. A PSD ut was ap-

plied to selet neutrons and events with unreasonably large reoil proton pulse

height, ompared to that expeted from the inident neutron energy and mea-

sured proton response, were rejeted.

12

The resulting TOF spetrum for a hardware threshold of

∼ 0.25 MeVee, shown

in Fig. 7, is virtually free of random oinidenes whih would (cid:28)ll in the 20-

30 ns TOF region between the photon peak (some photons beat the PSD ut)

and the neutron distribution. A low energy tail due to neutrons that sattered

en route to the detetors (and hene had a longer (cid:29)ight path) is present at (cid:29)ight

times of 100 ns and longer. These events were suppressed when the detetion

threshold was raised, and above 0.7 MeVee they were virtually eliminated as

disussed in Se. 3.2.

Assuming isotropi (cid:28)ssion neutron emission and negleting absorption e(cid:27)ets

dL

(Tn) =

dNn
dL (Tn)
ν · Nf iss · fn(Tn) · ∆Tn · ∆Ω/4π

(3)

13

where

dNn
dL (Tn) is the pulse-height spetrum for a neutron energy bin of width
∆Tn entered at Tn , ν = 3.76 (5.4%) is the average number of prompt neutrons
per (cid:28)ssion event, Nf iss is the number of (cid:28)ssion fragments ounted, fn(Tn)
(3.5%) is the energy distribution of prompt neutrons and ∆Ω (0.4%) is the

solid angle subtended by a detetor. Relative unertainties are given in the

brakets. The main soures of unertainty result from distortions of ν and
fn(Tn) due to not reording the full (cid:28)ssion-fragment, pulse-height spetrum
(Se. 2.2) and the fn(Tn) unertainty ontains a further fator due to the
unertainty in Tn .

The agreement between data and simulation is generally good, as shown in

Fig. 8. Sine the statistial unertainty inreases rapidly as neutron energy

inreases, the spetra were binned a fator of 2 more oarsely above 5 MeV.

The hardware threshold uts notieably into the pulse-height distribution for

values below 0.3 MeVee. This (voltage) threshold is not sharp due to pulse

shape dependene and hene di(cid:30)ult to model aurately. Thus 0.3 MeVee

represented a minimum software threshold whih ould be used for quanti-

tative analysis. At low inident energies multiple sattering leads to a more

peak-like shape of the spetrum whih (cid:29)attens out as the inident neutron

energy inreases. Above 6 MeV ompeting arbon ross setions lead to an

enhanement of pulse heights below

∼ 0.5 MeVee.

5.2 Integral detetion e(cid:30)ieny

The neutron yield Nn(Tn) was obtained for detetion thresholds of 0.3, 0.5,
0.7, and 1.0 MeVee from the TOF distribution (Fig. 7), onverted to Tn assum-
ing a path length of 1.5 m. Only events with Tn >1 MeV (TOF below 110 ns)

where a software pulse-height threshold ould be set above the unertain hard-

ware threshold range were analysed. Substituting Nn(Tn) for

dNn
dL (Tn) in Eq.3

delivered the absolute detetion e(cid:30)ieny, but the e(cid:30)ieny ould have been

alulated alternatively by integration of the pulse-height spetra.

The average e(cid:30)ienies, exluding the bottom detetors of the array, are pre-

sented in Fig. 9 and ompared to the MC preditions. At neutron energies very

lose to threshold the simulation under predits the data, espeially for the

distributions at 0.3 and 0.5 MeVee threshold. The sharp rise in the e(cid:30)ieny

just above threshold is well desribed by the MC simulation, although here

the data fall slightly below the model. Generally, the agreement is best in the

region between 5(cid:21)7 MeV where the e(cid:30)ieny funtion (cid:29)attens out and here

the relative di(cid:27)erene, de(cid:28)ned as (εexp − εM C) /εM C , is within 5%. At higher

energies the statistial preision of the data deteriorates due to the rapid fall

in (cid:28)ssion yield.

5.3 The deuteron photodisintegration measurement

As a test of the ability of the MC model to orret for systemati sattering

and absorption e(cid:27)ets in neutron photoprodution, the

2H (γ, n) p ross se-
tion was measured with tagged photons using a D2O target. The 9 m long,

ylindrial target had a diameter of 6.6 m and a signi(cid:28)ant fration of the pro-

dued neutrons interated in the target volume. The Nordball detetors were

252

positioned as in the

Cf e(cid:30)ieny measurement (Fig. 1) with the target en-

tered at the position previously oupied by the (cid:28)ssion soure. A 18 mm thik

plasti sintillator plaed between target and detetors aided identi(cid:28)ation of

harged partiles, mainly generated by Compton sattering and pair produ-

the rate in eah plasti-sintillator element of the foal plane was

∼ 400 kHz.

The 6(cid:21)8 MeV neutrons produed by two-body photodisintegration interated

in the detetors and bulk materials in the target-detetor loality. These in-

terations were evaluated with the oupled GEANT3-STANTON simulation,

yields.

resentation of two-body deuteron photodisintegration is with respet to the

proton CM angle. The good agreement between data and evaluation supports

the ability of the simulation to take sattering and absorption e(cid:27)ets into a-

ount, bearing in mind that

∼ 30% of the neutrons interated in the target

volume and also a signi(cid:28)ant fration in the plasti-sintillator sheet. Note

that the simple analytial approah to estimate neutron absorption in eah

material, on the basis of the reation ross setion and an exponential at-

tenuation funtion, underestimates neutron losses by more than 30%. This

approah fails to aount for elasti sattering e(cid:27)ets whih are important at

low neutron energies.

The average ross setion measured at the 5 angles was 81.4 ± 4.5(stat) ±
9.7(sys)µb/sr and the parameterisation of [27℄ gives a value of 84.7 ± 1.7µb/sr

where the unertainty is due to the unertainties in the oe(cid:30)ients of the Leg-

endre expansion of the angular distribution. For the present data, the soures

of systemati unertainty were detetor solid angle (0.7%), neutron satter-

ing and absorption (3.2%), detetion e(cid:30)ieny (5%), and random-bakground

subtration (7.6%). The unertainty for sattering and absorption was esti-

mated by omparing neutron attenuation oe(cid:30)ients from other experiments

(Se. 5.3.1) with the preditions of the present MC simulation.

The present measurement at neutron θlab = 90◦

is also onsistent with the

datum of [26℄ (Fig. 10).

5.3.1 Appliation to other detetor systems

The present simulation gives an exellent aount of the tagged (by the pion

apture reation π−p→

nγ ) neutron measurement of Ref. [29℄. This reported

not only the absolute e(cid:30)ieny of a 16 (4x4) ell array of liquid sintillators (of

somewhat smaller volume than the Nordball elements), but also the magnitude

of (cid:16)ross-talk(cid:17) e(cid:27)ets where neutrons satter from one ell to another. The

pion apture reation produed mono-energeti neutrons of 8.9 MeV kineti

energy whih were tagged by detetion of the 129 MeV photon in a large NaI

detetor. With two-body kinematis the angular range of the tagged neutron

beam was determined by that of the NaI detetor, hosen suh that the neutron

beam diretly illuminated the four entral neutron ells only. The measured

detetion e(cid:30)ieny was 21.3

0.1(stat)

0.6(sys)% for the full array while the

±

±

±

simulated e(cid:30)ieny with the present ode was 21.6

0.1(stat)%. Magnitudes

and shapes of the pulse-height distributions for ross-talk events were also

well reprodued. Further omparisons of simulation preditions with neutron

measurements [30,31℄ also show good agreement.

6 Conlusions

The sintillation response and detetion e(cid:30)ieny of the Nordball liquid sin-

tillator array for neutrons was measured using the well known (cid:28)ssion, fast-

252

neutron yield from a

Cf soure. Using the measured reoil proton pulse-

height response as input to a MC omputer model of Nordball, good agree-

ment between simulated and measured detetion e(cid:30)ienies was ahieved for

neutron energies up to 8 MeV. Above this the (cid:28)ssion yield is too low for

statistially signi(cid:28)ant alibrations.

The MC simulation is intended to provide systemati orretion fators for

18

Q
m
neutron photoprodution ross setions and this was heked by measuring

the well known

H(γ, n) p ross setion in the energy range Eγ = 14 − 18 MeV.
Comparison with parameterisations of the γ + d → p + n di(cid:27)erential ross

2

setion and previous data suggest that the unertainty of the MC alulation

is within 5%.

In the future we plan to onvert of the present GEANT-3 based ode to the

more modern ob jet-oriented GEANT-4 framework. This is now used exten-

sively to model ionising-radiation interations in matter at all energies and

has branhed into many appliations inluding medial physis.

Pixel Detectors for Tracking and their Spin-oﬀ
in Imaging Applications ⋆

Abstract

To detect tracks of charged particles close to the interaction point in high energy
physics experiments of the next generation colliders, hybrid pixel detectors, in which
sensor and read-out IC are separate entities, constitute the present state of the art in
detector technology. Three of the LHC detectors as well as the BTeV detector at the
Tevatron will use vertex detectors based on this technology. A development period of
almost 10 years has resulted in pixel detector modules which can stand the extreme
rate and timing requirements as well as the very harsh radiation environment at
the LHC for its full life time and without severe compromises in performance. From
these developments a number of diﬀerent applications have spun oﬀ, most notably
for biomedical imaging. Beyond hybrid pixels, a number of trends and possibilities
with yet improved performance in some aspects have appeared and presently de-
veloped to greater maturity. Among them are monolithic or semi-monolithic pixel
detectors which do not require complicated hybridization but come as single sen-
sor/IC entities. The present state in hybrid pixel detector development for the LHC
experiments as well as for some imaging applications is reviewed and new trends
towards monolithic or semi-monolithic pixel devices are summarized.

1 Radiation hard hybrid pixel detectors for the LHC

An almost 10 year long development of pixel detectors for tracking close to the
interaction point at the LHC was needed to develop pixel detector modules
which meet the very high demands on spatial resolution, timing precision,
long term operation performance and, most importantly, radiation tolerance
to doses of as much as 500 kGy. All developments have been based on the
hybrid pixel technique, in which sensor and FE-chips are separate parts of
the detector module connected by small conducting bumps applied using the
bumping and ﬂip-chip technology. This technique is the only one which at
present is robust and mature enough to cope with the above demands. All
LHC-collider-detectors ALICE [1,2], ATLAS [3,4], and CMS [5,6], LHCb (for
the RICH system) [7] at the LHC, BTeV [8] at the TEVATRON and the
CERN ﬁxed target experiment NA60 [9,10], employ the hybrid pixel technique
to build large scale (up to ∼2m2) pixel detectors. Pixel area sizes are typically
50µm × 400µm as for ATLAS or 100µm × 150 µm as for CMS. The detectors
are arranged in cylindrical barrels of 2 to 3 layers and disks covering the
forward and backward regions.

The discovery that oxygenated silicon is more radiation hard, with respect to
the non-ionizing energy loss of protons and pions, [11] than standard silicon,
allows operation of pixel detectors at the LHC for which the radiation is
most severe due to their proximity to the interaction point. Sensors with n+
electrodes in n-bulk material have been chosen to cope with the fact that type
inversion occurs after about Φeq = 2.5 × 1013cm−2. After type inversion the
pn-diode sits on the electrode side thus allowing the sensor to be operated
partially depleted. Figures 1(a) and (b) show the charge collection and the
pixel pattern of the ATLAS pixel sensor [12]. Note the structures of a bias
grid in the center of Fig. 1(b) which causes a drop of order 10% in the charge
collection eﬃciency between pixel cells as shown in Fig. 1(a). This is considered
tolerable in light of the beneﬁt that the bias grid allows to test the sensors
without a readout chip, an essential necessity for the building of large area
detectors.

The challenge in the design of the front-end pixel electronics [13] can be sum-
marized by the following requirements: low power (< 50µW per pixel), low
noise and threshold dispersion (together < 200e), zero suppression in every
pixel, on-chip hit buﬀering, and small time-walk to be able to assign the hits
to their respective LHC bunch crossing. The pixel groups at the LHC have
reached these goals in several design iterations using ﬁrst radiation-soft proto-
types, then dedicated radhard designs, and ﬁnally using deep submicron tech-
nologies. Figure 2 shows two recent wafer maps of ATLAS and CMS which
demonstrate that radiation hard front-end chips with high yields in excess of
∼80% have been fabricated for the production of these LHC pixel detectors.

the ATLAS pixel detector.

While CMS uses analog readout of hits up to the counting house, ATLAS ob-
tains pulse height information by means of measuring the time over threshold
(ToT) for every hit. Figure 3(a) shows the distribution of measured thresholds
of an ATLAS front-end chip. The dispersion of about 600 e− can be lowered
to below 50 e− by a 7-bit tuning feature implemented in the chip. Figure 3(b)
illustrates the eﬀect of time walk for small signals. For eﬃcient signal detection
within a deﬁned time of 20 ns with respect to the bunch crossing an overdrive
of about 1200e− is necessary. The bunch crossing occurs every 25 ns.

Fig. 2. Wafer maps of the pixel front-end chips of ATLAS and CMS show high chip
yields. For ATLAS the darkly marked chips are rejects. For CMS the very light and
very dark chips are rejected.

The chip and sensor connection is done by ﬁne pitch bumping and subsequent
ﬂip-chipping which is achieved with either PbSn (solder) or Indium bumps
at a failure rate of . 10−4. The Indium bumps are applied by a wet lift-oﬀ

technique and can be mated by direct thermo-compression [14,15] or reﬂowed,
as developed by CMS [16]. After bumping the chips are thinned by backside
grinding to a thickness of 150 - 180 µm. Fig. 4 shows rows of 50µm pitch
bumps obtained by these techniques. All of these bump bonding technologies
have been successfully used with 8” IC-wafers and 4” sensor wafers.

(c) Indium with reﬂow (Photo PSI, Villigen) bump rows with 50µm pitch.

In the case of CMS and ATLAS a module (cf Fig. 5(a)) of typically 2 cm × 6.5
cm area consists of 16 FE-chips bump-connected to one silicon sensor.The I/O
lines of the chips are connected via wire bonds to a kapton ﬂex circuit glued
atop the sensor. The ﬂex houses a module control chip responsible for front
end time/trigger control and event building. The total thickness at normal
incidence is in excess of 2% X0. The modules are arranged in barrel-ladders
or disk-sectors as shown in Fig. 5(b).

The most challenging task in the pixel development for LHC was to meet
the very high radiation dose that a pixel detector is exposed to during 10
years of operation (500 kGy). The advancement of oxygenated silicon and
deep submicron chip technology made a long life time in such an environment
possible. Figures 6(a)-(c) show the comparison of critical performance ﬁgures

before and after irradiation of ATLAS pixel modules. In parts the received
dose of the modules was well in excess of that expected for 10 years operation
at the LHC. After irradiation to 500 kGy the mean collected charge fraction
has been measured to be 87±14% and the in-time eﬃciency, i.e. the eﬃciency
for hit detection within 20ns after the bunch crossing, is 98.2%.

As the physics to be addressed with ALICE pixels is diﬀerent from those
addressed by ATLAS and CMS, a pixel module for ALICE has diﬀerent
key features. Because in ALICE the expected radiation is reduced (< 5kGy,
6 × 1012neq) cooling to temperatures below 0◦C as for CMS and ATLAS is
not mandatory. Very low total radiation length values are hence aimed for
and achieved by the reduced cooling requirements (to 24◦ C), thus contribut-
ing only with 0.1%X0, by a very light weight carbon ﬁbre support structure
(0.1%X0), and by using thin sensors (200 µm) and chips (150 µm). An ALICE
module (1.28 cm × 7.0 cm) contains 5 readout chips bonded to one sensor.
The total radiation length per layer is only 0.9%.

The CERN heavy ion experiment NA60 [10] has used LHC-type pixel detectors
for the ﬁrst time in a running experiment. The setup of the NA60 pixel tracker
is shown in Fig. 7(a). For the initial running the ALICE-LHCb chip was used.
Eight 4-chip (Fig. 7(b)) and eight 8-chip planes provide track reconstruction
with 11 pixel hits on a track. In a recent run the sensors have been exposed
to a radiation dose of 1.2 kGy and were operated through type inversion. Due
to the inhomogeneous irradiation the inner part of the planes has received
a larger dose than the outer, which is demonstrated by the hit multiplicity
pattern taken with a lowered bias voltage in Fig. 7(c). The NA60 experiment
has now upgraded the pixel detector by using original ATLAS pixel production
modules.

test beams relative to a ﬁxed delay of the trigger counters. The highest point of

2 Imaging with Hybrid Pixel Detectors

Hybrid pixel detectors have had an impact on imaging applications as detec-
tors that accumulate the incident radiation through the counting of individual
radiation quanta in every pixel cell. This technique oﬀers many features which
are very attractive for X-ray imaging: full linearity in the response function, in
principle an inﬁnite dynamic range, optimal exposure times and a good image
contrast compared to conventional ﬁlm-foil based radiography (cf. Fig. 8). It
thus avoids over- and under-exposed images. Counting pixel detectors must
be considered as a very direct spin-oﬀ of the detector development for particle
physics into biomedical applications. The analog part of the pixel electron-
ics is in parts close to identical to the one for LHC pixel detectors while the
periphery has been replaced by counting circuitry [17]. The same principle is
also used for protein-crystallography with synchrotron radiation [18,19].

The challenges which are to be addressed in order to be competitive with in-
tegrating systems are: high speed (> 1 MHz) counting with a range of at least
15 bits, operation with very little dead time, low noise and particularly low
threshold operation with small threshold dispersion values. In particular the
last item is important in order to allow homogeneous imaging of soft X-rays
of energies in the energy range below 10 keV. It is also mandatory for a diﬀer-
ential energy measurement, realized so far as a double threshold with energy
windowing logic [20,21,22], which can enhance the contrast of an image as the

can oﬀer a linear response (a) and a very good image contrast without over and
under exposure (b).

shape of the X-ray energy spectrum is diﬀerent behind diﬀerent absorbers (e.g.
bone or soft tissue). Finally, for radiography, high photon absorption eﬃciency
is mandatory, requiring the use and development of high Z sensors and their
hybridization.

Several counting pixel system development eﬀorts are being carried out: the
MEDIPIX collaboration [25,22] uses the MEDIPIX chip with 256 × 256, 55
×55µm2 pixels fabricated in a 0.25µm technology, energy windowing via two
tunable discriminator thresholds, and a 13 bit counter. The maximum count
rate per pixel is about 1 MHz. Fig. 9(a) shows an image of a 57Co (122 keV γ)
1 mm diameter point source obtained with the Medipix2 SINGLE chip bonded
to a 14x14 mm2 CdTe sensor [23]. A Multi-Chip module with 2x2 chips using
high-Z CdTe sensors with the MPEC chip [24] is shown in Fig. 9(b). The
MPEC chip features 32×32 pixels (200×200µm2), double threshold operation,
18-bit counting at ∼1 MHz per pixel as well as low noise values (∼120e with

8

CdTe sensor) and threshold dispersion (21e after tuning) [26,24]. A technical
issue here is the bumping of individual die CdTe sensors which has been solved
using Au-stud bumping with In-ﬁlling [27]. A challenge for counting pixel
detectors in radiology is to build large area detectors. Commercially available
integrating pixellated systems such as ﬂat panel imagers [28,29,30,31,32] set
the competition level.

In protein crystallography with synchrotron radiation [18] the challenge is to
image many thousands of Bragg spots from X-ray photons with energies of
∼12 keV (corresponding to resolutions at the 1˚A range) or higher, scatter-
ing oﬀ protein crystals. This must be accomplished at a high rate (∼1-1.5
MHz/pixel) and by systems with a high dynamic range. The typical spot size
of a diﬀraction maximum is 100 − 200µm, calling for pixel sizes in the order of
100 − 300µm. The high linearity of the hit counting method and the absence
of so-called ”blooming eﬀects”, i.e. the response of non-hit pixels in the close
neighborhood of a Bragg spot, makes counting pixel detectors very appealing
for protein crystallography experiments. A systematic limitation and diﬃculty
is the problem that homogeneous hit/count responses in all pixels, also for hits
at the pixel boundaries or between pixels where charge sharing plays a role
must be maintained by delicate threshold tuning (cf Fig. 10(b)). Counting
pixel developments are made for the ESRF (Grenoble, France) [33,34] and the
SLS (Swiss Light Source at the Paul-Scherrer Institute, Switzerland) beam
lines. A photograph of the PILATUS 1M detector [35] at the SLS (∼ 106
217µm ×217µm pixels, 18 modules, 20×24 cm2 area) is shown in Fig. 10
(top photograph). It is the ﬁrst large scale hybrid pixel detector in operation.
Fig. 10(c) shows some Bragg spots obtained from a Lysozyme crystal with a
10s exposure to 12 keV sychrotron X-rays [36]. Some spots are contained in
only one pixel, others spread over a few pixels due to charge sharing. This
demonstrates the intrinsically good point resolution of the system. Alterna-
tive developments which aim to improve the active/inactive area ratio for
protein-crystallography X-ray detection are so-called 3-D silicon sensors (strip
or pixels) [37]. A detailed account can be found in [38].

3 New directions with Hybrid Pixel Detectors

To further develop Hybrid Pixel detectors for use in specialized applications
and to improve in certain areas, several ideas and developments are being
pursued.

Diamond Pixels

The successful development of radiation hard CVD-diamond sensors [39] with
charge collection distances approaching 300 µm has triggered the develop-
ments of a hybrid pixel detector using diamond as sensors [40]. The non-
uniform ﬁeld distribution inside CVD-diamond, which originates from the
grain structure in the charge collection bulk, leads to charge trapping at the
grain boundaries [41] and – as a result – to shift in the position of recon-
structed hits of the order of 100µm - 150µm. Diamond pixel detectors are
well suited to study this eﬀect [41]. Single chip pixel modules using ATLAS
front-end electronics have been built and tested in a high energy (180 GeV)
pion beam. Figure 11(a) shows the diamond pixel detector, Fig. 11(b) is a hit
response pattern obtained by exposing the detector to a 109Cd source of 22
keV γ rays, which deposits approximately 1/4 of the charge of a minimum
ionizing particle. This demonstrates the good charge collection eﬃciency ob-
tained. Diamond sensors with charge collection distances in in excess of 300
µm have been fabricated and tested [42]. Figure 11(c) and (d) show position
correlation and the charge distribution of the diamond pixel detector in a high
energy beam, respectively. A spatial resolution of σ = 22µm has been mea-
sured with 50µm pixel pitch, compared to about 12µm with Si pixel detectors
of the same geometry using the same electronics, revealing the inﬂuence of the
mentioned position shifts.

HAPS

MCM-D

In order to achieve smaller pixel implant pitches with relaxed readout cell
pitches capacitive coupling between pixels can be exploited as is done in the
HAPS (Hybrid (Active) Pixel Sensors) concept [43]. This technique is adopted
from capacitively coupled silicon micro strip detectors. The ratio of the num-
ber of interleaved to read-out pixels can be as large as 22/3 [43]. The charge
accumulated on interleaved pixels couples via inter-pixel capacitances to the
pixel cells which are read out. The implant pitch is designed for best spatial
resolution using charge sharing between neighbors, while the readout pitch is
tailored to the size needs of the front-end electronics cell. In this way resolu-
tions between 3µm and 10µm can be obtained with pixel (readout) pitches of
100µm (200µm) [43].

The present hybrid-pixel modules of the LHC experiments use an additional
ﬂex-kapton ﬁne-print layer on top of the Si-sensor (Fig. 12(a)) to provide power

and signal distribution to and from the module front-end chips. An alternative
to the ﬂex-kapton solution is the so-called Multi-Chip-Module Technology
deposited on Si-substrate (MCM-D) [44]. A multi-conductor-layer structure is
built up on the silicon sensor. This allows all bus structures to be buried in
four layers in the inactive area of the module thus avoiding the kapton ﬂex
layer and any wire bonding at the expense of a small thickness increase of
0.1% X0 (Fig. 12(b)). The extra freedom in routing also allows the design of
pixel detectors which have the same pixel dimensions throughout the sensor.

4 Monolithic and Semi-Monolithic Pixel Detectors

Monolithic pixel detectors, in which amplifying and logic circuitry as well
as the radiation detecting sensor are one entity, are in the focus of present
developments. To reach this ambitious goal, optimally using a commercially
available and cost eﬀective technology, would be another breakthrough in the
ﬁeld. So far it has not been completely reached and compromises are made. The
present developments have been much inﬂuenced by R&D for vertex tracking
detectors at future colliders such as the International Linear e+e− Collider
(ILC) [46]. Very low (≪1% X0) material per detector layer, small pixel sizes
(∼20µm×20µm) and a high rate capability (80 hits/mm2/ms) are required,
due to the very intense beamstrahlung of narrowly focussed electron beams
close to the interaction region, which produce electron positron pairs in vast
numbers. High readout speeds with typical line rates of 50 MHz and a 40µs
frame time are necessary.

To classify the diﬀerent monolithic approaches some distinctions can be made
by posing the following questions:

- does the device allow full CMOS circuitry ? also in the active sensor area ?

13

- is the charge collection performed in a fully depleted bulk providing a large

signal ?

- does the processing technology employ a standard process or are specialized

(non-commercial) technologies necessary ?

The above mentioned ultimate monolithic goal would be fulﬁlled with a full
CMOS commercial standard device with charge collection in a fully depleted
bulk.

The present developments can then be characterized accordingly.

- Non-standard CMOS on high resistivity bulk

The ﬁrst monolithic pixel detector was successfully operated in a particle
beam already in 1992 [47] using a high resistivity p-type bulk p-i-n detector
in which the junction had been created by an n-type diﬀusion layer. On
one side, an array of ohmic contacts to the substrate served as collection
electrodes. Due to this, only pMOS transistor circuits sitting in n-wells were
possible to be integrated in the active area. The technology was certainly
non-standard and non-commercial. No further development emerged.

- CMOS technology with charge collection in epi-layer

In some CMOS technologies a lightly doped epitaxial silicon layer of a few
to 15µm thickness between the low resistivity silicon bulk and the planar
processing layer can be used for charge collection [48,49,50]. The generated
charge is kept in a thin epi-layer atop the low resistivity silicon bulk by
potential wells at the boundary and reaches an n-well collection diode by
thermal diﬀusion (cf. Fig. 13(a)). The sensor is depleted only directly under
the n-well diode. The signal charge is hence very small (<1000e) and mostly
incomplete; low noise electronics is the challenge in this development. As a
pay-oﬀ, the fabrication of such pixel sensors is potentially very cheap. With
small pixel cells collection times in the order of 100 ns - 150 ns are obtained.
Despite using CMOS technology, the potential of full CMOS circuitry in
the active area is not available (only nMOS) because of the n-well/p-epi
collecting diode which does not permit other n-wells. CMOS monolithic ac-
tive pixel sensors are similar to CMOS camera chips, but they are larger in
area and must have a 100% ﬁll factor for eﬃcient particle detection. The
epi-layer is – technology dependent – at most 15µm thick and can also be
completely absent. Collaborating groups around IReS&LEPSI [51,52], RAL
[53], Irvine-LBNL-Ohio [54], and Hawaii-KEK [55] use similar approaches to
develop large scale CMOS active pixels also called MAPS (Monolithic Ac-
tive Pixel Sensors) [49]. Prototype detectors have been produced in 0.6µm,
0.35µm and 0.25µm CMOS technologies [56,57].

Matrix readout of MAPS is performed using a standard 3-transistor cir-
cuit (line select, source-follower stage, reset) commonly employed by CMOS
matrix devices, but can also include current ampliﬁcation and current mem-

ory [56]. For an image two complete frames are subtracted from each other
(CDS) which suppresses switching noise. Noise ﬁgures of 10-30e and S/N
∼20 have been achieved with spatial resolutions below 5µm. Regarding ra-
diation hardness MAPS appear to sustain non-ionizing radiation (NIEL) to
∼1012neq while the eﬀects of ionizing radiation damage (IEL) are at present
still under investigation. The present focus of further development lies in
making larger area devices for instance by stitching over reticle boundaries
[57], increasing the charge collection performance in the epi-layer by triple-
well [53], photo-gate [58], and photo-FET [56,52] techniques and developing
a higher radiation tolerance. In addition, for applications like e.g. precise
beam position monitoring in hadron therapy, devices with very thin en-
trance windows are needed to detect ∼20 keV electrons scattering oﬀ a thin
metal foil held in a hadron beam. Such a thinned MAPS detector, which is
also capable of autoradiographic tritium detection, is shown in Fig. 13(b).
Above all, the advantages of a fully CMOS monolithic device relate to the
adoption of standard VLSI technology and its resulting low cost potential
(∼25$ per cm2). In turn the disadvantages are also largely related to the
dependence on commercial standards. The thickness of the epi-layer varies
for diﬀerent technologies. It is thinner for processes with smaller structure
sizes and along with this also the signal decreases. Only a few process-
ing technologies are suited. With the rapid change of commercial process
technologies this is an issue of concern. Furthermore, as already stated, in
the active area, due to the n-well collection diode, only nMOS circuitry is
possible. The voltage signals are very small (∼mV), of the same order as
transistor threshold dispersions requiring very low noise VLSI design. The
radiation tolerance of CMOS pixel detectors for particle detection beyond
1012 neq is still a problem although the achieved tolerance should be well
suﬃcient for use in a future Linear Collider environment. Improved read-
out concepts and device development for high rate particle detection at a
linear collider are under development [46]. Concrete project planning to use
CMOS active pixels in real experiments are the upgrades to the STAR mi-

15

cro vertex detector [56] and to the Super Belle detector (innermost layer) at
KEK, for which very encouraging prototype developments and results have
been presented at this conference [55].

- CMOS on SOI (non-standard)

In order to exploit high resistivity bulk material, the authors of [59] develop
pixel sensors with full CMOS circuitry using the Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI)
technology. The connection to the charge collecting bulk is done by vias (Fig.
14(left)). The technology oﬀers full charge collection in 200–300µm high
resistive silicon with full CMOS electronics on top. At present the technology
is however deﬁnitely not a commercial standard and the development is still
in its beginnings. More details on this interesting new technology has been
reported at this conference and can be found in [60].

- Amorphous silicon on standard CMOS ASICs

Hydrogenated amorphous-Silicon (a-Si:H), where the H-content is up to
20%, can be put as a ﬁlm on top of CMOS ASIC electronics. a-Si:H has
been studied as a sensor material long ago and has gained interest again
[62,63] with the advancement in low noise, low power electronics. The sig-
nal charge collected in the <30µm thick ﬁlm is in the range of 500-1500
electrons. A cross section through a typical a-Si:H device is shown in Fig.
14(right). From a puristic view it is more a hybrid technology, but the main
disadvantage, the hybridization connection, is absent. The radiation hard-
ness of these detectors appears to be very high >1015cm−2 due to the defect
tolerance and defect reversing ability of the amorphous structure and the
larger band gap (1.8 eV). The carrier mobility is very low (µe = 2-5 cm2/Vs,
µh = 0.005 cm2/Vs), i.e. essentially only electrons contribute to the signal.
Basically any CMOS circuit and IC technology can be used and technology
changes are not critical for this development. For high-Z applications poly-
crystalline HgI2 constitutes a possible semiconductor ﬁlm material. The

potential advantages are small thickness, radiation hardness, and low cost.
The development is still in its beginnings and – as for CMOS active pixel
sensors – a real challenge to analog VLSI design.

- Ampliﬁcation transistor implanted in high resistivity bulk

In so-called DEPFET pixel sensors [64] a JFET or MOSFET transistor
is implanted in every pixel on a sidewards depleted [65] bulk. Electrons
generated by radiation in the bulk are collected in a potential minimum un-
derneath the transistor channel thus modulating its current (Fig. 15). The
bulk is fully depleted rendering large signals. The small capacitance of the
internal gate oﬀers low noise operation. Both together can be used to fabri-
cate thin devices. The sensor technology is non-standard and the operation
of DEPFET pixel detectors requires separate steering and ampliﬁcation ICs.

Fig. 15. Principle of operation of a DEPFET pixel structure based on a sidewards
depleted detector substrate material with an imbedded planar ﬁeld eﬀect transistor.
Cross section (left) of half a pixel with symmetry axis at the left side, and potential
proﬁle (right).

The DEPFET detector principle is shown in Fig. 15. Sidewards depletion
[65] provides a parabolic potential which has – by appropriate biasing and
a so-called deep-n implantation – a local minimum for electrons (∼ 1µm)
underneath the transistor channel. The channel current can be steered and
modulated by the voltage at the external gate and - important for the de-
tector operation - also by the deep-n potential (internal gate). Electrons
collected in the internal gate are removed by a clear pulse applied to a dedi-
cated contact outside the transistor region. The very low input capacitance
(∼ few fF) and the in situ ampliﬁcation makes DEPFET pixel detectors very
attractive for low noise operation [66]. Ampliﬁcation values of 400 pA per
electron collected in the internal gate have been achieved. Further current
ampliﬁcation and storage enters at the second level stage.

DEPFET pixels are currently being developed for three very diﬀerent ap-
plication areas: vertex detection in particle physics [67,68], X-ray astronomy
[69] and for biomedical autoradiography [66]. With round single pixel struc-
tures noise ﬁgures of 2.2e at room temperature and energy resolutions of
131 eV for 6 keV X-rays have been obtained [68]. With small (20x30 µm2)

17

linear structures fabricated for particle detection at a Linear Collider (ILC)
the noise ﬁgures are about 10e. The spatial resolution in matrices operated
with 50 kHz line rates is [68,66] σ = (4.3 ± 0.8)µm (57 LP/mm) for 22 keV
γ and σ = (6.7±0.7)µm (37 LP/mm) for 6 keV γ. The capability to observe
tritium in autoradiography applications has been demonstrated [66,68].

Fig. 16. (top) Sketch of a ILC ﬁrst layer module with thinned sensitive area sup-
ported by a silicon frame. The enlarged view show a DEPFET matrix and a
DEPFET double pixel structure, respectively, (bottom) photo of a DEPFET matrix
readout system for LC applications. The sequencer chips (SWITCHER II) for select
and clear are placed on the sides of the matrix, the current readout chip (CURO
II) at the bottom.

The very good noise capabilities of DEPFET pixels are very important
for low energy X-ray astronomy and for autoradiography applications. For
particle physics, where the signal charge is large in comparison, this fea-

18

ture is used to design very thin detectors (∼50µm) with very low power
consumption when operated as a row-wise selected matrix [70,68]. Thin-
ning of sensors to a thickness of 50µm using a technology based on deep
anisotropic etching has been successfully demonstrated [71]. For the devel-
opment of DEPFET pixels for a Linear Collider, matrix row rates of 50 MHz
and frame rates for 520x4000 pixels of 25 kHz, read out at two sides, are
targeted. Sensors with cell sizes of 20x30µm2 have been fabricated and com-
plete clearing of the internal gate, which is important for high speed on-chip
pedestal subtraction, has been demonstrated [68]. A sketch of a ﬁrst layer
module made of DEPFET sensors is shown in ﬁg. 16(top). A large matrix
is readout using sequencer chips for row selection and clear, and a column
readout chip based on current ampliﬁcation and storage [70,68]. Both chips
have been developed at close to the desired speed for a Linear Collider.
Figure 16(bottom) shows a DEPFET pixel matrix readout system suited
for readout speeds at the ILC. The estimated power consumption for a ﬁve
layer DEPFET pixel vertex detector at the ILC is only 5W. This assumes
a power duty cycle of 1:200 and no power consumption of the SWITCHER
chip in the oﬀ state. Such a performance renders a very low mass detector
without cooling pipes feasible. The most recent structures use MOSFETs
as DEPFET transistors for which the radiation tolerance still has to be
investigated.

5 Summary

The Hybrid Pixel technology, in which sensor and electronic chip are separate
entities connected via bump bonding techniques, has shown the way to large
area (∼m2) pixel detectors for experiments at the LHC. These detectors are in
construction and the maturity of the technology, including radiation tolerance
to 500 kGy doses, has been proven. New developments include interleaved
pixels having diﬀerent pixel- and readout pitches, MCM-D structures, and
the use of diamond as a sensor. Hybrid pixels in which radiation quanta are
individually counted and summed over an exposure time have opened a new
approach in radiology imaging, especially at low dose rates. Monolithic or
semi-monolithic detectors, in which detector and readout ultimately are one
entity, are currently being developed in various forms, largely driven by the
needs for particle detection at future colliders. CMOS active pixel sensors
using standard commercial technologies on low resistivity bulk and SOI pixels,
a-SI:H, and DEPFET-pixels, which try to maintain high bulk resistivity for
charge collection, constitute the diﬀerent eﬀorts to monolithic detectors which
are presently being carried out.

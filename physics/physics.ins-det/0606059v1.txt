The Beijing Electron Collider is being upgraded (BEPCII) to a two-ring collider with a design luminosity of
−1 at a center-of-mass energy of 3.89 GeV. It will operate between 2 and 4.2 GeV in the center
1
of mass. With this luminosity, the BESIII detector will be able to collect, for example, 10 billion J/ψ events in
one year of running. This will be a unique facility in the world opening many physics opportunities. BEPCII and
BESIII are currently under construction, and commissioning of both is expected to begin in summer 2007.

1. Introduction

The

Beijing

Electron-Positron Collider
(BEPC) at the Institute of High Energy Physics
(IHEP) in Beijing has been, until recently, a
unique facility running in the tau-charm center-
of-mass energy region from 2 to 5 GeV with
a luminosity at the J/ψ peak of 5 × 1030cm−2
s−1. The Beijing Spectrometer (BESI [1] and
BESII [2]) detector at the BEPC has operated
since about 1990 and studied many physics top-
ics, including a precision measurement of the tau
mass [3] and a detailed R-scan [4], and obtained
58 million events at the J/ψ, 14 million at the
ψ

, and over 30 pb−1 at the ψ′′.
In 2003, the Chinese Government approved
the upgrade of the BEPC to a two-ring col-
lider (BEPCII) with a design luminosity approx-
imately 100 times higher than that of the BEPC.
This will allow unprecedented physics opportuni-
ties in this energy region and contribute to pre-
cision ﬂavor physics. In this paper, BEPCII and
BESIII will be described, along with their sta-
tus. Another paper presented at this conference
will provide more detail on BESIII physics and
on BESIII simulation studies [5].

Currently BESII has been removed from the in-
teraction region. The BEPCII linac installation
is complete and that of the storage ring started
in March 2006. The installations of the muon

counter and the super-conducting magnet into
the BESIII detector are also complete.

2. BEPCII

BEPCII is a two-ring e+e− collider that will
run in the tau-charm energy region (Ecm = 2.0 −
4.2 GeV) with a design luminosity of 1 × 1033
cm−2s−1 at a beam energy of 1.89 GeV, an im-
provement of a factor of 100 with respect to
the BEPC. This is accomplished by using multi-
bunches and micro-beta. The upgrade uses the
existing tunnel and some old magnets.

The 2024 meter long linac has been upgraded
with new klystrons, a new electron gun, and a new
positron source to increase its energy and beam
current; it can accelerate electrons and positrons
up to 1.89 GeV with an positron injection rate of
50 mA/min. Its installation was completed in the
summer of 2005 (see Fig. 1), and it reached most
design speciﬁcations.

There are two storage rings with lengths of
237.5 meters.
The collider has new super-
conducting RF cavities, power supplies, and
control; super-conducting quadrupole magnets;
beam pipes; magnets and power supplies; kick-
ers; beam instrumentation; vacuum systems; and
control. The old dipoles are modiﬁed and used
in the outer ring. Electrons and positrons will
collide at the interaction point with a horizontal

crossing angle of 11 mrad and bunch spacing of 8
ns. Each ring has 93 bunches with a beam cur-
rent of 9170 mA. The machine will also provide a
high ﬂux of synchrotron radiation at a beam en-
ergy of 2.5 GeV. The manufacture of major equip-
ment such as magnets, superconducting RF cavi-
ties (with the cooperation of KEK and MELCO)
and quadrupole magnets (with the cooperation of
BNL), as well as the cryogenics system, is com-
plete. Installation in the tunnel began in March
2006. Beam collisions are expected in summer of
2007.

3. BESIII

The BESIII detector consists of a berylium
beam pipe, a helium-based small-celled drift
chamber, Time-Of-Flight counters for particle
identiﬁcation, a CsI(Tl) crystal calorimeter, a
super-conducting solenoidal magnet with a ﬁeld
of 1 Tesla, and a muon identiﬁer using the mag-
net yoke interleaved with Resistive Plate Coun-
ters (RPC). Fig. 2 shows the schematic view of
the BESIII detector, including both the barrel
and endcap portions.

3.1. Main Drift Chamber

The main drift chamber (MDC) is 2.58 meters
in length and has an inner radius of 63 mm and
an outer radius of 0.81 m. The inner and outer
cylinders are carbon ﬁber. As shown in Fig. 3,

Figure 2. Schematic view of the BESIII detector.

there is a short inner portion near the beam pipe,
a stepped region, and a cone shaped outer region.
The polar angle coverage is cos θ = 0.83 for a
track passing through all layers, and cos θ = 0.93
for one that passes through 20 layers. The end-
plates are machined with a hole position accu-
racy better than 25 microns. Altogether there
are 43 layers of 25 micron gold plated tungsten
wires; the ﬁeld wires are 110 micron gold-plated
aluminum. The cells are approximately square,
and the size of the half-cell is 6 mm in the in-
ner portion of the drift chamber and is 8.1 mm in
the outer portion. The chamber will use a 60/40
He/C3H8 gas mixture.

The expected spatial, momentum, and dE/dx
resolutions are σs = 130µm, σp/p = 0.5% at 1
GeV/c, and σdE/dx/dE/dx ∼ 6%, respectively.
Beam tests performed with prototype electronics
at KEK in a 1 T magnetic ﬁeld yielded a spatial
resolution better than 110 microns and dE/dx
resolution better than 5%. The readout uses the
CERN HPTDC. The wiring of the drift chamber
has been completed, and the electronics assembly
of the chamber has started.

3.2. TOF

Outside the MDC is the time of ﬂight (TOF)
system, which is crucial for particle identiﬁcation.
It consists of a two layer barrel array of 88 50 mm
x 60 mm x 2320 mm BC408 scintillators in each
layer and endcap arrays of 48 fan shaped BC404
scintillators. Hamamatsu R5942 ﬁne mesh pho-
totubes will be used - two on each barrel scintilla-
tor and one on each endcap scintillator. Expected
time resolution for kaons and pions and for two
layers is 100 to 110 ps, giving a 2σ K/π separation
up to 0.9 GeV/c for normal tracks. This has been
conﬁrmed in a beam test of a TOF counter using
prototype electronics. The scintillator and photo-
tubes for the TOF system will be delivered before
summer 2006, and the system will be tested and
ready for installation in January 2007. A laser
TOF calibration system is being built by the Uni-
versity of Hawaii.

3.3. Calorimeter

The CsI(Tl) crystal calorimeter contains 6240
crystals. The typical crystal is 5 × 5 cm2 on the
front face and 6.5 × 6.5 cm2 on the rear face with
a length of 28 cm or 15 radiation lengths. Figure 4
shows a schematic of the assembly containing an
aluminum plate with two photodiodes (Hama-
matsu S2744-08) with 10 mm by 20 mm sensi-
tive area and an aluminum box for the preamp
mounted on the end of a crystal. The expected

Figure 4.

Schematic of the photodiode and

energy and spatial resolutions at 1 Gev are 2.5 %
and 0.6 cm, respectively.

The CsI(Tl) crystals are being produced at
Saint-Gobain, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics,
and Hamamatsu (Beijing). Most of the crystals
have been delivered, and their size, light yield,
uniformity, and radiation hardness are satisfac-
tory. A beam test shows that the electronics noise
from the preampliﬁer, main ampliﬁer, charge dig-
itizer, and 18 meters of cable was less than 1000
electrons equivalent per crystal, corresponding to
about 220 keV of energy.

Figure 5 shows the prototype mechanical struc-
ture for mounting the crystals. The crystals are
held by screws and there are no walls between
crystals. Mechanical assembly will start soon and
should be completed by the end of the year. By
the end of the year, all electronics boards should
be tested and installed.

3.4. Magnet

The BESIII super-conducting magnet is the
ﬁrst of its kind built in China. The vacuum
cylinder and the supporting cylinder are made
in China, in collaboration with the Wang NMR
company of California, and the wiring of the
super-conducting cable and later the epoxy cur-

ing, assembly, and testing were all done at IHEP
with advice from experts all over the world. The
superconducting magnet is a 3.91 m long single
layer solenoid with a 1 T magnetic ﬁeld at a nom-
inal current of 3650 A. The ﬁeld in the MDC will
have a uniformity better than 5 %, and it will
be measured with an accuracy better than 0.25
%. The magnet is complete, and Fig. 6 shows
its installation into BESIII. The magnet will be
tested before summer, and the ﬁeld mapping will
be done with the super conducting quadrupoles
in place using a computer controlleed mapping
machine before December 2006.

3.5. Muon Counter

The magnet return iron has 9 layers of Resis-
tive Plate Chambers (RPC) in the barrel and 8
layers in the endcap to form a muon counter. The
electrodes of the RPCs are made from a special
phenolic paper laminate on bakelite, which has a
very good surface quality. The gas used is Ar :
C2H2F4 : Isobutane (50:42:8). Extensive testing
and long term reliability testing has shown that
the chambers have high eﬃciency, low dark cur-
rent, and good long term stability.

All the RPCs for the muon identiﬁer have been
manufactured, tested, and installed, as shown in
Fig. 7. The average dark current and noise level
for all chambers installed after one weeks training
is 1.6 µA/m2 and 0.095 Hz/cm2, respectively, for
a high voltage corresponding to an average eﬃ-

ciency of 95 %. The spatial resolution obtained
was 16.6 mm.

3.6. Trigger, Data Acquisition, and Oﬄine

Software

The trigger design is almost ﬁnalized;

it is
pipelined and uses FPGAs. Information from the
TOF, MDC, and muon counter will be used. The
maximum trigger rate at the J/ψ will be about
4000 Hz with a good event rate of about 2000 Hz.
All boards should be tested and installed by the
end of 2006.

The whole data acquisition system has been
tested to 8 kHz for an event size of 12 Kb, which is
a safety margin of a factor of two. The expected
bandwidth after level one is 48 Mbytes/s. The
data acquisition system is 1000 times the perfor-
mance of BESII.

The preliminary verson of the BES Oﬄine Soft-
ware System (BOSS) is complete. A tremen-
dous amount of work has been accomplished but
much remains to be done. Simulation is based
on Geant4. Figure 8 shows a BESIII event dis-
play. Figure 9 shows D decays reconstructed
from a simulated 50,000 ψ′′ inclusive event sam-
ple. The beam constrained mass resolution for
D0 → K −π+ is σBC = 1.2 MeV/c2. Simulation
and reconstruction is done using BOSS.

4. Physics in the tau-charm energy region

The tau-charm energy region makes available
a wide variety of interesting physics. Data can
be taken at the J/ψ, ψ(2S), and ψ(3770), at τ
threshold, and at a energy to allow production of
Ds pairs, as well as for an R-scan.

In 2003, the construction of wiggler magnets at
the CESR collider at Cornell was approved that
would allow the energy of their machine to be
lowered to compete with BES, and a test run was
made with a single wiggler magnet. Since 2005,
CESR has had a full complement of these mag-
nets, and the luminosity of CLEOc is currently
less than 1 × 1032 cm−2 s−1. CLEOc is scheduled
to ﬁnish data taking in 2008.

BEPCII and BESIII will begin commissioning
in summer 2007. The design luminosity of BE-
SIII is 1 × 1033 cm−2. Clearly BESIII with higher
luminosity will contribute greatly to precision ﬂa-
vor physics: Vcd and Vcs will be measured with
a statistical accuracy of 1.6%. D0D0 mixing and
CP violation will be searched for. Table 1 gives
the numbers of events expected during one year
of running at various energies. Huge J/ψ and
ψ(2S) samples will be obtained. The ηC , χCJ ,
and hC can be studied with high statistics. The
ρπ puzzle will be studied with better accuracy.

tion of RPCs for the muon counter.

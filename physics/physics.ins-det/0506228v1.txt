Abstract

In this paper we discuss the measurement of charge collection in irradiated silicon
pixel sensors and the comparison with a detailed simulation. The simulation im-
plements a model of radiation damage by including two defect levels with opposite
charge states and trapping of charge carriers. The modeling proves that a doubly
peaked electric ﬁeld generated by the two defect levels is necessary to describe the
data and excludes a description based on acceptor defects uniformly distributed
across the sensor bulk. In addition, the dependence of trap concentrations upon
ﬂuence is established by comparing the measured and simulated proﬁles at several
ﬂuences and bias voltages.

1 Introduction

The CMS experiment, currently under construction at the Large Hadron Col-
lider (LHC) will include a silicon pixel detector [1] to allow tracking in the
region closest to the interaction point. The detector will be a key component

for reconstructing interaction vertices and heavy quark decays in a particu-
lary harsh environment, characterized by a high track multiplicity and heavy
irradiation. The innermost layer, located at only 4 cm from the beam line, is
expected to be exposed to an equivalent ﬂuence of 3 × 1014 neq/cm2/yr at full
luminosity.

In these conditions, the response of the silicon sensors during the detector
operation is of great concern. It is well understood that the intra-diode electric
ﬁelds in these detectors vary linearly in depth reaching a maximum value at
the p-n junction. The linear behavior is a consequence of a constant space
charge density, Neﬀ, caused by thermodynamically ionized impurities in the
bulk material. It is well known that the detector characteristics are aﬀected by
radiation exposure, but it is generally assumed that the same picture is valid
after irradiation. In fact, it is common to characterize the eﬀects of irradiation
in terms of a varying eﬀective charge density. In [2] we have proved that this
picture does not provide a good description of irradiated silicon pixel sensors.
In addition, it was shown that it is possible to adequately describe the charge
collection characteristics of a heavily irradiated silicon detector in terms of a
tuned double junction model which produces a double peak electric ﬁeld proﬁle
across the sensor. The modeling is supported by the evidence of doubly peaked
electric ﬁelds obtained directly from beam test measurements and presented
in [3]. In this paper we apply our model to sensors irradiated to lower ﬂuences
demonstrating that a doubly peaked electric ﬁeld is already visible at a ﬂuence
of 0.5×1014 neq/cm2. In addition, the dependence of trap concentrations upon
ﬂuence is established by comparing the measured and simulated proﬁles at
several ﬂuences and bias voltages.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the experimental setup,
Section 3 describes the carrier transport simulation used to interpret the data.
The tuning of the double junction model is discussed in Section 4 with the
results of the ﬁt procedure. The conclusions are given in Section 5.

2 Experimental setup

The measurements were performed in the H2 line of the CERN SPS in 2003/04
using 150-225 GeV pions. The beam test apparatus is described in [4]. A silicon
beam telescope [5] consisted of four modules each containing two 300 m m thick
single-sided silicon detectors with a strip pitch of 25 m m and readout pitch
of 50 m m. The two detectors in each module were oriented to measure hori-
zontal and vertical impact coordinates. A pixel hybrid detector was mounted
between the second and third telescope modules on a cooled rotating stage. A
trigger signal was generated by a silicon PIN diode. The analog signals from
all detectors were digitized in a VME-based readout system by two CAEN

2

(V550) and one custom built ﬂash ADCs. The entire assembly was located
in an open-geometry 3T Helmholtz magnet that produced a magnetic ﬁeld
parallel or orthogonal to the beam. The temperature of the tested sensors was
controlled with a Peltier cooler that was capable of operating down to -30◦C.
The telescope information was used to reconstruct the trajectories of individ-
ual beam particles and to achieve a precise determination of the particle hit
position in the pixel detector. The resulting intrinsic resolution of the beam
telescope was about 1 m m.

The prototype pixel sensors are so-called “n-in-n” devices: they are designed
to collect charge from n+ structures implanted into n–bulk silicon. All test
devices were 22×32 arrays of 125×125 µm2 pixels having a sensitive area of
2.75×4 mm2. The substrate was 285 µm thick, n-doped, diﬀusively-oxygenated
silicon of orientation h111i, resistivity of about 3.7 kΩ·cm and oxygen concen-
tration in the order of 1017 cm−3. Individual sensors were diced from fully
processed wafers after the deposition of under-bump metalization and indium
bumps. A number of sensors were irradiated at the CERN PS with 24 GeV
protons. The irradiation was performed without cooling or bias. The deliv-
ered proton ﬂuences scaled to 1 MeV neutrons by the hardness factor 0.62 [6]
were 0.5×1014 neq/cm2, 2×1014 neq/cm2 and 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. All samples
were annealed for three days at 30◦C. In order to avoid reverse annealing,
the sensors were stored at -20◦C after irradiation and kept at room tempera-
ture only for transport and bump bonding. All sensors were bump bonded to
PSI30/AC30 readout chips [7] which allow analog readout of all 704 pixel cells
without zero suppression. The PSI30 settings were adjusted to provide a linear
response to input signals ranging from zero to more than 30,000 electrons.

3 Sensor simulation

A detailed sensor simulation was implemented, including a physical modeling
of irradiation eﬀects in silicon. Our simulation, pixelav [2, 8, 9], incorporates
the following elements: an accurate model of charge deposition by primary
hadronic tracks (in particular to model delta rays); a realistic 3-D electric ﬁeld
map resulting from the simultaneous solution of Poisson’s Equation, continuity
equations, and various charge transport models; an established model of charge
drift physics including mobilities, Hall Eﬀect, and 3-D diﬀusion; a simulation of
charge trapping and the signal induced from trapped charge; and a simulation
of electronic noise, response, and threshold eﬀects. A ﬁnal step reformats the
simulated data into test beam format so that it can be processed by the test
beam analysis software.

The eﬀect of irradiation was implemented in the simulation by including two
defect levels in the forbidden silicon bandgap with opposite charge states and

3

trapping of charge carriers. The model, similar to one proposed in [10], is
based on the Shockley-Read-Hall statistics and produces an eﬀective space
charge density ρeﬀ from the trapping of free carriers in the leakage current.
The eﬀective charge density is related to the occupancies and densities of traps
as follows,

ρeﬀ = e [NDfD − NAfA] + ρdopants

(1)

where: ND and NA are the densities of donor and acceptor trapping states,
respectively; fD and fA are the occupied fractions of the donor and acceptor
states, respectively, and ρdopants is the charge density due to ionized dopants.
Each defect level is characterized by an electron and hole trapping cross sec-
tion, σD
e/h, for the donor and acceptor trap, respectively, and by an
activation energy, ED and EA for the donor and acceptor trap, respectively. An

illustrative sketch of the model is shown in Fig. 1. Trapping of the mobile car-
riers from the generation-recombination current produces a net positive space
charge density near the p+ backplane and a net negative space charge density
near the n+ implant as shown in Fig. 1(a). Since positive space charge density
corresponds to n-type doping and negative space charge corresponds to p-
type doping, there are p-n junctions at both sides of the detector. The electric
ﬁeld in the sensor follows from a simultaneous solution of Poisson’s equation
and the continuity equations. The resulting z-component of the electric ﬁeld
is shown in Fig. 1(b). It varies with an approximately quadratic dependence
upon z having a minimum at the zero of the space charge density and maxima
at both implants. A more detailed description of the double junction model
and its implementation can be found in [2].

4 Data analysis

Charge collection across the sensor bulk was measured using the “grazing
angle technique” [11]. As is shown in Fig. 2, the surface of the test sensor is
oriented by a small angle (15◦) with respect to the pion beam. A large sample

The charge measured by each pixel along the y direction samples a diﬀerent
depth z in the sensor. Precise entry point information from the beam telescope
is used to produce ﬁnely binned charge collection proﬁles.

The charge collection proﬁles for a sensor irradiated to a ﬂuence of Φ =
0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2 and Φ = 2 × 1014 neq/cm2 and operated at several bias
voltages are presented in Fig. 3(a-c) and Fig. 3(d-g), respectively. The mea-
sured proﬁles, shown as solid dots, are compared to the simulated proﬁles,
shown as histograms. The two trap model has six free parameters (ND, NA,
σD
e , σD
h ) that can be adjusted. The activation energies are kept ﬁxed
to the values of [10]. Additionally, the electron and hole trapping rates, Γe
and Γh, are uncertain at the 30% level due to the ﬂuence uncertainty and
possible annealing of the sensors. They are treated as constrained parameters.
The donor concentration of the starting material is set to 1.2 × 1012 cm−3
corresponding to a full depletion voltage of about 70 V for an unirradiated de-
vice. The parameters of the double junction model were systematically varied
and the agreement between measured and simulated charge collection proﬁles
was judged subjectively. The procedure was repeated at the each ﬂuence and
the optimal parameter set was chosen when agreement between measured and
simulated proﬁles was achieved for all bias voltages.

The simulation describes the measured charge collection proﬁles well both
in shape and normalization. In particular,the “wiggle” observed at low bias
voltages is also nicely described. The relative signal minimum near y = 700 µm
(see Fig. 3) corresponds to the minimum of the electric ﬁeld z-component, Ez,
where both electrons and holes travel only short distances before trapping.
This small separation induces only a small signal on the n+ side of the detector.
At larger values of y, Ez increases causing the electrons drift back into the
minimum where they are likely to be trapped. However, the holes drift into the
higher ﬁeld region near the p+ implant and are more likely to be collected. The
net induced signal on the n+ side of the detector therefore increases and creates
the local maximum seen near y = 900 µm. The z-component of the simulated
electric ﬁeld, Ez, is plotted as a function of z in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) for
Φ = 0.5×1014 neq/cm2 and Φ = 2×1014 neq/cm2, respectively. The ﬁeld proﬁles

have minima near the midplane of the detector and maxima at the detector
implants as discussed in Section 3. Figure 4(a) shows that a double peak
electric ﬁeld is necessary to describe the measured charge collection proﬁles
even at the lowest measured ﬂuence, usually referred to as close to the “type
inversion point”. The dependence of the space charge density upon the z
coordinate is shown in Fig. 4(c). Before irradiation the sensor is characterized
by a constant and positive space charge density of 1.2 × 1012 cm−3 across the
sensor bulk. After a ﬂuence of 0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2 the device shows a negative
space charge density of about −1 × 1012 cm−3 for about 70% of its thickness,
a compensated region corresponding to the Ez minimum and a positive space
charge density close to the backplane. The increase of the space charge density
upon z is not linear due to the varying charge carrier mobilities across the bulk
and to the requirement of a constant current density.

The model parameters obtained with the best ﬁt procedure are shown in Ta-
ble 1 1 . We observe that the donor trap concentration increases more rapidly

5 Conclusions

In this paper we show that a model of irradiated silicon sensors based on
two defect levels with opposite charge states and trapping of charge carriers
can be tuned using charge collection measurements and provides a good de-
scription of the measured charge collection proﬁles in the ﬂuence range from
0.5×1014 neq/cm2 to 6×1014 neq/cm2.

The model produces an electric ﬁeld proﬁle across the sensor that has maxima
at the implants and a minimum near the detector midplane. This corresponds

7

to negative space charge density near the n+ implant and and positive space
charge density near the p+ backplane. We ﬁnd that it is necessary to decrease
the ratio of acceptor concentration to donor concentration as the ﬂuence in-
creases. This causes the electric ﬁeld proﬁle to become more symmetric as the
ﬂuence increases.

Given the extracted electric ﬁeld and space charge density proﬁles we suggest
that the correctness and the physical signiﬁcance of eﬀective doping densi-
ties determined from capacitance-voltage measurements are quite unclear. In
addition, we remark that the notion of partly depleted silicon sensors after ir-
radiation is inconsistent with the measured charge collection proﬁles and with
the observed doubly peaked electric ﬁelds.

The charge-sharing behavior and resolution functions of many detectors are
sensitive to the details of the internal electric ﬁeld. A known response function
is a key element of any reconstruction procedure. A working eﬀective model
will permit the detailed response of these detectors to be tracked as they are
irradiated in the next generation of accelerators.

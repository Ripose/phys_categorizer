Abstract

The design, construction and operation of a Compton back-scattering laser po-
larimeter at the HERA storage ring at DESY are described. The device measures
the longitudinal polarization of the electron beam between the spin rotators at the
HERMES experiment with a fractional systematic uncertainty of 1.6 %. A measure-
ment of the beam polarization to an absolute statistical precision of 0.01 requires
typically one minute when the device is operated in the multi-photon mode. The
polarimeter also measures the polarization of each individual electron bunch to an
absolute statistical precision of 0.06 in approximately ﬁve minutes. It was found that
colliding and non-colliding bunches can have substantially diﬀerent polarizations.
This information is important to the collider experiments H1 and ZEUS for their
future longitudinally polarized electron program because those experiments use the
colliding bunches only.

1 Introduction

In high-energy storage rings, electron (positron) beams can become trans-
versely polarized through the emission of synchrotron radiation [1]. This pro-
cess involves a small asymmetry in the spin-ﬂip amplitudes, which enhances

the population of the spin state antiparallel (parallel) to the magnetic bending
ﬁeld. The polarization develops in time according to

P (t) = P∞ (cid:16)1 − e−t/τ(cid:17) ,

(1)

where the asymptotic polarization P∞ and the time constant τ are character-
istics of the ring conditions. In the absence of depolarizing eﬀects, the max-
imum polarization theoretically achievable is Pth = 0.924, and the rise-time
constant, which depends on the bending radius of the storage ring and the
beam energy, is τth = 37 min for the HERA storage ring operated at an
energy Ee = 27.5 GeV.

Depolarizing eﬀects can however substantially reduce the maximum achievable
polarization. These intricate eﬀects cannot generally be precisely controlled,
making it necessary to continuously measure the beam polarization. The depo-
larizing eﬀects also aﬀect the actual rise-time, which scales with P∞ according
to

τ = P∞ (cid:18) τth

Pth(cid:19) .

(2)

Thus for a typical beam polarization of 0.55, the rise-time is about 22 min.

This article describes a polarization monitor at the HERA electron ring at
DESY, which is based on Compton scattering of circularly polarized photons
from an intense pulsed laser beam. This method for measuring the polariza-
tion of stored electron beams 2 was suggested more than 30 years ago [2], and
has been employed at many laboratories [3] to measure the transverse polar-
ization. Compton scattering has also been employed at linear accelerators [4]
to measure the longitudinal polarization. In recent years, the NIKHEF [5] and
MIT-Bates [6] laboratories have developed Compton polarimeters to monitor
the longitudinal beam polarization in their storage rings. At DESY, a Comp-
ton polarimeter [7] had been constructed in 1992 to measure the transverse
polarization of the electron beam in the HERA West section. This Trans-
verse Polarimeter measured the electron beam polarization with an initial
fractional systematic uncertainty of 9 %, which has subsequently been im-
proved to 3.4 % [8].

The Longitudinal Compton Polarimeter was added to obtain an independent
and more precise measurement of the beam polarization at HERA, with very
diﬀerent systematic uncertainties and the capability to measure individual
bunch polarizations. It was commissioned during fall 1996, and provides a

photons for the two helicity states λ = ±1, Pe is the longitudinal polarization
of the electron beam, and Az(Eγ) is the longitudinal asymmetry function,
which is shown in Fig. 1 for a 2.33 eV photon scattered oﬀ a 27.5 GeV electron.

Eγ (GeV)

Fig. 1. The longitudinal asymmetry function Az versus the energy Eγ of the
back-scattered Compton photons for the case of a 2.33 eV photon incident on a
27.5 GeV electron.

The total unpolarized cross section is 377 mb, and the diﬀerential cross sec-
tion is peaked at the maximum energy (Eγ,max = 13.6 GeV) of the back-
scattered Compton photons, hereafter called the Compton edge. The longitu-
dinal asymmetry function has a maximum of about 0.60 at the Compton edge.
As the energy of the Compton photons decreases, Az decreases rapidly and
becomes negative below 9.1 GeV, corresponding to scattering angles smaller
than 90◦ in the electron rest frame, and returns to zero at Eγ = 0. Due to
the enormous kinematic boost from the electron beam (the Lorentz factor is
Ee/me ≈ 5.4 · 104), most back-scattered Compton photons are contained in a
narrow cone centered around the initial direction of the struck electrons. This
is very advantageous to a polarization monitor because it allows the detector
to be far away (many tens of meters) from the interaction region. However, the

3

spatial distribution of the Compton photons on the detector surface is given
not only by the Compton kinematics but also by the electron beam optics.
Therefore, if the interaction point is chosen at a position where the divergence
of the electron beam is small, the transverse size of the photon detector can be
suﬃciently small to accommodate only moderate separations of the Compton
photons and the electron beam, and thus meet the spatial constraints given
by the HERA electron ring.

3 Apparatus

A schematic overview of the Longitudinal Polarimeter arrangement is shown
in Fig. 2. A circularly polarized photon beam from a pulsed laser is focused
on the HERA electron beam. The laser-electron interaction point is located
between the two bending magnets BH39 and BH90 at 39 m and 90 m from
the HERMES target, respectively. A calorimeter measures the energy of the
back-scattered Compton photons for each laser pulse. If the electron beam
is longitudinally polarized, the energy distributions of the Compton photons
diﬀer for left-handed and right-handed photon helicities.

3.1 Laser and Optics

A frequency-doubled, pulsed Nd:YAG laser [12] operated at 532 nm, corre-
sponding to a photon energy of Eλ = 2.33 eV, is used for the measurements.
The laser produces 3 ns long pulses of linearly polarized light and can be
operated with a continuously variable repetition rate from single shot up to
100 Hz, and pulse energies from 1 to 250 mJ. The laser is synchronized with
the electron bunches in the HERA ring, and triggered at close to 100 Hz. The
timing and the intensity of each laser pulse are measured by two photo diodes
as shown in Fig. 3. To minimize pulse-to-pulse intensity ﬂuctuations, the laser
is operated at a ﬁxed energy of 100 mJ per pulse. The intensity of the laser

4

pulses can be controlled by passing the laser beam through a rotatable half
wave plate and a ﬁxed Glan-Thompson prism.

The linearly polarized laser light is converted to a circularly polarized beam by
passing it through an electrically reversible birefringent cell, known as a Pock-
els cell. The voltage on the Pockels cell [13] is adjusted to produce a quarter
wave phase shift which is reversed each pulse. The degree of circular polariza-
tion |Pλ| of the laser beam is larger than 0.999 for each of the two helicity states
λ = ±1, and is checked regularly with a polarization analyzer [14] consisting
of a rotatable half wave plate, a Glan-Thompson prism, and a photo diode.
Before entering the laser transport system, the beam diameter is expanded by
a factor of four by a set of plano-concave and plano-convex lenses [15]. This
beam expander reduces the divergence of the laser beam to allow it to traverse
the 80 m long light path to the laser-electron interaction region and also to
reduce the resulting waist at the interaction point. In addition, it minimizes
the sensitivity to variations in the laser beam divergence, and it reduces the
energy density of the laser beam to prevent damage to the optical components
in the light path.

Fig. 3. Arrangement of the optical system in the laser room.

The laser beam is guided by six remotely controlled mirrors [16] through a total
of 72 m of stainless steel vacuum pipe, and focused with a lens doublet [17] on
the HERA electron beam, as shown in Fig. 4. The mirrors are arranged in three
phase-compensated pairs to maintain the polarization of the photon beam
close to 100 %. Behind each mirror, a video camera is installed to monitor the
laser beam position. The laser beam enters the storage ring vacuum through
a 1 cm thick fused silica window [18] and is brought into collision with the
electron beam at a vertical angle of 8.7 mrad. The window was mounted with
Helicoﬂex gaskets [19] to minimize stress such that it has negligible optical
retardation.

5

At the interaction point, the laser spot has a diameter of approximately
0.5 mm, and the transverse size of the electron beam is σx ≈ 0.6 mm hor-
izontally and σy ≈ 0.2 mm vertically. Each electron bunch is approximately
11 mm long (corresponding to 37 ps), i.e. about one hundred times shorter than
the laser pulse. After passing through the interaction point, the laser beam
exits the storage ring vacuum system through an identical vacuum window
and enters a second polarization analyzer which also monitors the position
and the intensity of the laser light.

3.2 Laser−Electron Interaction Region

The location of the laser-electron interaction region was chosen to optimize
the rate of the back-scattered Compton photons versus the background rate,
and to minimize changes to the electron ring vacuum system. Maximizing the
Compton rate means that the crossing angle between the laser beam and the
electron beam should be as small as possible, and the horizontal widths of
the electron and laser beams should both be small. In addition, the transverse
spatial distribution of the back-scattered Compton photons due to the size and
divergence of the electron beam had to be minimized, since the back-scattered
photons have to travel about 54 m to the calorimeter.

The laser-electron interaction point is located in the East Right HERA tunnel
section, 13 m downstream of the ﬁrst dipole magnet BH39, which bends the
beam by 0.54 mrad (Fig. 2). This is enough to prevent a large fraction of
the bremsstrahlung generated by the residual gas in the long straight vacuum
section upstream of BH39, and by the HERMES gas target in particular,
from reaching the calorimeter. On the other hand, it is little enough that it
rotates the spin by only 1.9◦. The corresponding reduction of the measured
longitudinal beam polarization is negligible (0.06 %).

6

The scattered electrons and photons travel with the unscattered electron beam
until the electrons are deﬂected by the dipole magnet BH90, which has a
bending radius of 1262 m and deﬂects the beam by 2.7 mrad. A collimator is
installed in the beam line 6 m downstream of BH90 to further reduce possible
bremsstrahlung contributions from the HERMES target. In order to minimize
changes to the electron ring vacuum system, the calorimeter position was cho-
sen 16 m downstream of BH90. This puts strict constraints on the transverse
size of the calorimeter, since the electron beam and the center of the back-
scattered Compton photon distribution are separated by only 42 mm at the
chosen position.

3.3 The Compton Photon Detector

The detector assembly is mounted on a remotely controlled table that can be
moved vertically and horizontally. A light tight aluminum box contains the
electromagnetic shower detector shown schematically in Fig. 5. The detector
is positioned very close to the electron beam pipe during normal operation.
Therefore, the lateral face of the box near the beam pipe is made of a 3 mm
thick tungsten plate to protect the detector against soft synchrotron radiation
emerging from the beam pipe.

The front of the detector is positioned 21 mm downstream of a copper vac-
uum window in the HERA beam tube. This window is 2 mm thick and 34 mm
in diameter. The Compton photons enter the detector through a set of two
6 mm (2 × 1.1 radiation lengths) thick lead plates, which serves as an eﬀec-
tive shield against the intense synchrotron radiation generated by the dipole
magnet BH90. The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of four optically iso-
lated NaBi(WO4)2 crystals. Each crystal is 20 cm long (19 radiation lengths),
22 mm wide and 22 mm high, arranged in a 2 × 2 array, as displayed in Fig. 5.
The crystal material has a high index of refraction (n = 2.15), and is very
radiation-hard (7·107 rad) [20,21] and compact (Moli`ere radius 2.38 cm). The
Compton photons generate an electromagnetic shower in the lead preshower

7

and the crystals. The charged particles of the electromagnetic shower pro-
duce ˇCerenkov light, which is detected by one photomultiplier tube [22] for
each crystal. The sharing of the shower between the four calorimeter blocks
allows a sub-millimeter alignment of the NaBi(WO4)2 array with respect to
the Compton photon beam.

3.4 Trigger and Electronics

The event trigger is provided by a pulser at a rate of approximately 200 Hz.
The laser is ﬁred by only every second pulse, allowing a background event to
be recorded following each Compton event. Each laser pulse is synchronized
with the HERA bunch clock, which is provided by a bunch trigger module
(BTM) [23]. The BTM is also used to select a speciﬁc electron bunch in a
sequence determined by a programmable Digital Signal Processor (DSP) [24].
Four consecutive events are recorded for each selected bunch: for each of the
two light helicity states, one background event and one event where the laser
was ﬁred. The program of the DSP further provides the option of scanning any
subset of the beam bunches in any sequence. From the recorded single bunch
data, one can extract the polarization of a single bunch, the average beam
polarization of all the bunches, or the polarization of any set of bunches, e.g.
only colliding or non-colliding bunches. The trigger also allows for pedestal or
gain monitoring events during empty HERA beam bunches. The HERMES
gain monitoring system [10] monitors the response of the Compton photon
detector by sending laser light pulses through glass ﬁbers that are coupled to
the front faces of the NaBi(WO4)2 crystals.

The signals from the four photomultiplier tubes are digitized by a charge sen-
sitive ADC [25], and transferred by the DSP to the HERMES data acquisition
system, which is described in detail elsewhere [10]. Also the signals from the
various photodiodes are recorded. For each Compton event, the timing of the
laser pulse measured by the “laser timing” PIN diode (see Fig. 3) is recorded
relative to the bunch timing by a TDC [26].

4 Polarimeter Operation

Normal operation of the Longitudinal Polarimeter requires an optimum over-
lap of the laser and electron beams in both space and time to maximize the
back-scattered Compton rate. The spatial overlap is achieved by steering the
laser beam horizontally through the interaction point with mirror M4 (see
Fig. 4). The timing of the laser pulse is set with respect to the electron bunches
by adjusting the laser trigger delay for maximum luminosity.

8

The luminosity is monitored continuously by the polarimeter control sys-
tem [27]. If the luminosity drops below a speciﬁed value, the procedures de-
scribed above are executed automatically to re-optimize it. This online feed-
back system also ensures that the calorimeter remains centered on the back-
scattered Compton photon distribution, and that the startup and shutdown
of the laser system are executed automatically. Therefore, under normal con-
ditions, polarization measurements are performed without intervention during
HERA operation.

The detector can be operated in two diﬀerent modes, the single-photon and the
multi-photon mode. In contrast to the single-photon mode, in which the energy
of each individual Compton photon is analyzed, in the multi-photon mode
one measures the total energy deposited in the detector by many Compton
photons per laser pulse interaction with an electron bunch. The multi-photon
mode was chosen as the standard mode of operation to provide high statistics
single bunch measurements in real time, and to overwhelm the bremsstrahlung
backgrounds originating from the residual vacuum pressure in the straight
section between the two dipole magnets BH39 and BH90. The single-photon
mode is used for test and diagnosis purposes only.

4.1 Single-Photon Mode

The advantages of running in single-photon mode would be twofold. The asym-
metries are large, up to 0.60 at the Compton edge (see Fig. 1), and the energy
spectra can be compared to the Compton cross sections. Operation of the
Longitudinal Polarimeter in this mode is possible if the laser pulse intensity is
drastically reduced. However, the resolution for single-photon events is rather
poor, as shown in Fig. 6, because most of the generated ˇCerenkov light is
trapped in the crystals and does not reach the photomultiplier tubes due to
the high index of refraction of the crystals and the 3 mm air gap between the
crystals and the photomultiplier tubes. While Compton spectra can be pro-
duced, and the beam polarization can be extracted, this is not a feasible mode
of operation with the 100 Hz laser, since a measurement of the beam polar-
ization with an absolute statistical accuracy of 0.01 takes about 2.5 hours. In
comparison, such a measurement takes only one minute in the multi-photon
mode.

In the single-photon mode, the asymmetry can be written as

As(Eγ) =

(dσ/dEγ) 1
(dσ/dEγ) 1

The electron beam polarization is determined by ﬁtting the energy spectra for
the two spin conﬁgurations using a simulation (solid line in Fig. 6) that in-
cludes the response function and resolution of the detector, and realistic back-
ground conditions [28] above a Compton photon energy of 4 GeV. Whereas
the simulation represents the data well above 4 GeV, it considerably underes-
timates the background at lower energies.

4.2 Multi-Photon Mode

The operation of the Longitudinal Polarimeter in multi-photon mode has the
advantage of being eﬀectively independent of bremsstrahlung background in
the HERA storage ring. A large number of Compton photons is produced
each time a laser pulse interacts with an electron bunch. These photons are
detected together by the calorimeter, which measures their energy sums I 1
2 electron-photon conﬁgurations, respectively.

sections for the spin- 1

the single-photon relative response function r(Eγ) = S(Eγ)/Eγ (where S is

Assuming a linear energy response of the detector, the analyzing power has
a value of 0.1838 for Eλ = 2.33 eV and Ee = 27.5 GeV. The energy-weighted
Compton cross sections for the two spin conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 7.
Their asymmetry is largest for photon energies close to the Compton edge
(Eγ,max). For small photon energies the two distributions are nearly identical.
This has the advantage that the analyzing power is not very sensitive to the
detector energy threshold Eγ,min.

4.3 Polarization Determination

In order to determine the single-photon relative response function r(Eγ) of the
NaBi(WO4)2 calorimeter, test beam measurements were performed at DESY
and CERN, covering the entire energy range of the back-scattered Compton
photons, as shown in Fig. 8. The resulting analyzing power was found to
be 0.1929 ± 0.0017. Note that only the precision of the measurement of the
calorimeter response is important, and not its deviation from linearity.

However, to apply the result for the relative response function obtained from
the test beam measurements to Eq. (6), it was necessary to show that the
photomultiplier response is linear over the full single-photon to multi-photon
operating range. This was veriﬁed using the gain monitoring system. The ul-
timate test was then to show that the measurement of the beam polarization

was not aﬀected by changing from single-photon to multi-photon mode. This
was demonstrated by attenuating the laser beam intensity over three orders of
magnitude using a rotatable half wave plate and a ﬁxed Glan-Thompson prism
while increasing the photomultiplier high-voltage such that the digitized sig-
nal of the photomultiplier remained constant. The test was performed during
stable electron beam conditions while monitoring the beam polarization with
the Transverse Polarimeter by observing the ratio of the polarization of the
two polarimeters. As shown in Fig. 9, the ratio was constant over the entire
range.

Once the calorimeter response was understood in the single-photon and multi-
photon modes, the longitudinal beam polarization was determined by evalu-
ating the calorimeter signals for every bunch individually. Although the laser
is triggered by a precise electronic signal that is synchronized with the HERA
bunch timing, the time of the resulting light pulse ﬂuctuates within ±1.5 ns.
Because of this ﬂuctuation and the ﬁnite crossing angle, the 37 ps long electron
bunches interact with varying parts of the 3 ns long laser pulses. As mentioned
earlier, the timing of each laser pulse is recorded relative to the trigger signal.
The calorimeter signal reﬂects the temporal proﬁle of the laser pulses if it is

12

plotted versus the relative trigger time, as shown in Fig. 10. With a ﬁt to this
distribution, the calorimeter response is corrected for this variation.

ˇCerenkov Light Attenuation

A large number of Compton photons can be produced per laser pulse when
the polarimeter is operated in the multi-photon mode, ranging from a few
photons to many thousand. During normal operating mode in which about

13

1000 back-scattered Compton photons are produced at the beginning of a ﬁll,
approximately 250 times more energy is deposited in the calorimeter than the
highest energies (bremsstrahlung) deposited in the single-photon mode, since
the average energy deposited per Compton photon is 6.8 GeV. In order to
attenuate the ˇCerenkov light to protect the photomultiplier tubes from satu-
ration, a remotely controlled movable, perforated nickel foil could be inserted
into the 3 mm air gap between the NaBi(WO4)2 crystals and the photomulti-
plier tubes. This was initially the standard mode of operation.

Even though the NaBi(WO4)2 crystals are 19 radiation lengths long, there is
a small amount of longitudinal shower leakage into the photomultiplier tubes.
Unfortunately, the corresponding shower particles generate a large signal in
the photomultiplier tubes, which introduces a substantial non-linearity in the
energy response. The longitudinal shower leakage signal derives mostly from
the highest energy Compton photons and hence has a large analyzing power.
When the ˇCerenkov light produced in the NaBi(WO4)2 crystals was attenu-
ated by the nickel foil, the shower leakage signal dominated the signal in the
photomultiplier tubes. This altered the response function and increased the
analyzing power of the detector by about 25 %.

The polarimeter has been operated without any light attenuators since early
1999. This was also the case for the test beam calibrations. The gain in the
photomultiplier tubes has to be reduced in the multi-photon mode by about a
factor of 200. As described in Section 4.3, it was veriﬁed that the photomulti-
plier tubes are linear over this large range in gain. To address concerns about
long-term stability, linearity, and radiation damage, a tungsten/scintillator
sampling calorimeter, similar to the one employed in the Transverse Polarime-
ter [7] but without position sensitivity, is moved in the Compton photon beam
periodically. It acts as an independent device to check the beam polarization
measurement and is otherwise not exposed to bremsstrahlung and direct syn-
chrotron radiation.

5 Polarimeter Performance

Since early 1997 the Longitudinal Polarimeter has routinely measured the
HERA electron beam polarization for the HERMES experiment. Typical elec-
tron beam ﬁlls last from eight to twelve hours, starting with a ramped injection
current of 40 to 45 mA and ending usually with a controlled beam dump when
the current reaches about 10 mA. Fig. 12 shows an example of polarization
measurements as a function of time for three consecutive ﬁlls. Each data point
represents a one minute measurement of the longitudinal polarization with an
absolute statistical accuracy of 0.01. The time structure in the ﬁrst ﬁll dis-
played in Fig. 12 is the result of tuning eﬀorts by the HERA operators. In the

14

1997 and 1998 running periods the electron beam helicity was reversed every
few months; since then it has been reversed once a month.

5.1 Single Bunch Measurements

The Longitudinal Polarimeter measures the polarization of individual bunches,
as shown in Fig. 13. Each data point represents a measurement lasting twenty
minutes with an absolute statistical accuracy of 0.03. Not all electron bunches
collide with proton bunches in HERA, and it was found that the colliding and
non-colliding electron bunches can have diﬀerent polarization values. This is
believed to be caused by beam-beam interactions between the electron and
proton beams and the associated tune shifts. Comparison of the polarization
of the 174 colliding and the 15 non-colliding bunches is a useful tool for tuning
the accelerator to optimize polarization. This information is shown in Fig. 14
and is provided in real time to the HERA control room every minute, with
an absolute statistical precision of 0.01 (0.04) for the colliding (non-colliding)
bunches.

Analyzing individual electron bunches is as of yet unique to the Longitudinal
Polarimeter. An upgrade of the data acquisition system [29] of the Transverse

15

Polarimeter at HERA, which is in progress, will also have this important
feature. This detailed polarization information about the electron beam will
be crucial for the collider experiments H1 and ZEUS since they are preparing
to measure spin observables after the luminosity upgrade in 2001. Whereas
the HERMES experiment is sensitive to the average beam polarization of all
the bunches, the collider experiments are sensitive to the colliding bunches
only.

5.2 Systematic Uncertainties

Various studies have been performed to investigate the systematic uncertainty
associated with the polarization measurements by the Longitudinal Polarime-
ter operated in the multi-photon mode. Since the polarization of the electron
beam is obtained from a measurement of an asymmetry Am (see Eq. (5)), po-
tential sources of false asymmetries were investigated. Other studies quantiﬁed
the precision with which the analyzing power Ap and the circular light polar-
ization Pc at the interaction point are determined. The various contributions
to the total systematic uncertainty are summarized in Table 1, and apply to
the polarimeter operating conditions without optical ﬁlters in the calorimeter,
i.e. since early 1999.

The largest contribution to the overall systematic uncertainty originates from
the determination of the analyzing power, which depends strongly on the ex-
act shape of the relative detector response function r(Eγ) (see Fig. 8). The
energy calibration of the detector in the test beams takes into account most
sources that can lead to a non-linear response of the detector including the
crystals, and the signal generated in the photomultiplier tubes by the longi-
tudinal shower leakage (see section 4.4). It does not account for the response
of the photomultiplier tubes in the multi-photon mode, but it accounts for
the low-energy cut-oﬀ from the lead absorber, and the limited size of the
calorimeter. The analyzing power was determined to a precision of 1.2 % that

16

was calculated by propagating the systematic uncertainty of the relative re-
sponse function (0.9 %) shown in Fig. 8, and by including the uncertainty
of the transition from single-photon to multi-photon mode (0.8 %) shown in
Fig. 9.

The long-term stability of the detector response function is checked by mon-
itoring the sources that can produce a time-dependent non-linear detector
response. The linearity of the photomultiplier tubes is checked continuously
with the gain monitoring system over the full multi-photon operating range
and is found to deviate by less than 0.4 % over the annual running period.
The eﬀect on the analyzing power is of the same size. The annual radiation
dose deposited in the crystals was determined to be about ten times below
the level of damage. Instead of considering all contributions separately, the
overall systematic uncertainty can also be estimated by periodically perform-
ing measurements with the sampling calorimeter to compare the polarization
measurements of the two detectors. Based on this comparison, the systematic
uncertainty associated with the long-term instability of the analyzing power
is 0.5 %.

Possible false asymmetries introduced by gain-mismatched photomultiplier
tubes have been considered. An iterative method based on data from scan-
ning the Compton photon beam across the detector front face is used to gain-
match the detector elements within an accuracy of about 5%. The gains of
the photomultiplier tubes are monitored continuously and found to change
by approximately 20 − 30 % during a beam ﬁll, returning to their initial val-
ues between ﬁlls. These short-term drifts diﬀer by only a few percent for the
four photomultiplier tubes and therefore have no net eﬀect on the polariza-
tion measurement, since the Longitudinal Polarimeter does not depend on an
absolute energy calibration. Long-term deviations of the relative gains during
the annual running were found to aﬀect the beam polarization measurement
by less than 0.3 %.

The circular polarization of the laser light can be determined very precisely [30]
immediately following the Pockels cell in the laser room. However, it can in
principle be diﬀerent at the interaction point, given the fact that the laser
beam has to be passed through windows and lenses and be reﬂected from mir-
rors before it interacts with the electron beam. To estimate this uncertainty,
the laser beam polarization was measured after the storage ring vacuum win-
dow with the identical analyzer that is normally mounted in the laser room.
The two vacuum windows were removed, then each window was mounted sep-
arately, and ﬁnally the ring vacuum was re-established, while measuring the
laser beam polarization after each step. Based on these measurements, a sys-
tematic uncertainty of 0.2 % was assigned to the circular polarization of the
laser light at the interaction point.

17

The measurement may also be aﬀected by changes in the phase space of the
laser beam at the interaction point due to an imperfectly aligned Pockels cell.
Horizontal or vertical shifts of the laser beam can occur when the voltage
across the cell is changed, resulting in a helicity-dependent luminosity and
hence a false energy asymmetry. To quantify extraneous helicity-dependent
beam shift eﬀects in the system, we performed two tests. First, a half wave
plate was temporarily mounted immediately following the Pockels cell. Except
for the expected change of sign in the measurement of the electron beam polar-
ization, no change in the magnitude was observed within the 0.3 % precision of
the test. However, this test does not account for non-optimal laser and electron
beam overlap. This is important since the sensitivity to a helicity-dependent
laser beam shift increases with decreasing overlap. Therefore a second test
was performed by changing the overlap of the two beams within the limits
of the normal operating conditions. This showed that the impact on the en-
ergy asymmetry is at most 0.3 %. Combining the two values leads to a total
contribution of 0.4 %.

The position and size of the Compton photon beam incident on the calorime-
ter is determined by the electron beam orbit conditions at the interaction
point. During normal HERA luminosity operation, variations of the size and
divergence of the electron beam are so small that the impact on the calorime-
ter response is negligible. However, a change of the position or slope of the
electron beam at the interaction point can result in a shift of the Compton
photon distribution away from the center of the calorimeter. In these cases,
the online feedback system of the polarimeter automatically repositions the
calorimeter center on the Compton photon beam to better than 1 mm preci-
sion. By scanning the Compton photon beam across the calorimeter front face,
it has been determined that within the relevant operating range, the eﬀect on
the measurement of the beam polarization is less than 0.6 %. To estimate the
eﬀect of slow beam drifts during a ﬁll, the slope of the electron beam was
moved over the maximal observed range while keeping the Compton photon
distribution centered on the calorimeter. No inﬂuence on the polarization mea-
surement was observed within the 0.5 % accuracy of the study. Combining the
uncertainties of the two tests leads to a total contribution of at most 0.8 %.

The various contributions to the systematic uncertainties of the Longitudi-
nal Polarimeter have been considered separately and added in quadrature to
a total uncertainty of 1.6 % (see Table 1). Those systematic uncertainties of
the two HERA electron beam polarimeters that relate to stability and re-
producibility (not absolute scale) can be further studied by comparing their
performances over an extended period of time. Non-statistical ﬂuctuations in
the ratio of their results over the 1999-2000 running periods correspond to
a relative systematic stability of σ = 1.6 %, which is compatible with the
quadratic sum of contributions estimated from the two instruments.

6 Summary

We have designed and constructed a Compton back-scattering laser polarime-
ter which routinely measures the longitudinal polarization of the HERA elec-
tron beam for the HERMES experiment. The Longitudinal Polarimeter de-
termines the beam polarization with an absolute statistical precision of 0.01
per minute and a fractional systematic uncertainty of 1.6 %. The polarimeter
also measures the polarization of individual electron bunches, a feature that
is currently not available to the Transverse Polarimeter. It was found that the
individual bunches can each have a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent polarization. This
observation can be further analyzed if one groups the bunches into colliding
and non-colliding bunches. The variation and the time evolution of the polar-
ization of the individual bunches and of classes of bunches provide important
additional information for achieving high beam polarization at HERA.

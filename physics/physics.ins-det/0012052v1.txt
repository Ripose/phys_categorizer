Sputtered Nb thin-ﬁlm LC resonators for low frequencies at 0.5 MHz have been fabricated and tested
in the temperature range 0.05 – 1 K in magnetic ﬁelds up to 30 mT. Their Q value increases towards
−0.5 and reaches ∼ 103 at 0.05 K. As a function of magnetic ﬁeld
decreasing temperature as Q ∝ T
Q is unstable and displays variations up to 50 %, which are reproducible from one ﬁeld sweep to the
next. These instabilities are attributed to dielectric losses in the plasma deposited SiO2 insulation
layer, since the thin-ﬁlm coil alone reaches a Q& 105 at 0.05 K.

I. INTRODUCTION

An electrical resonator with a high quality factor Q
is a sensitive device for the measurement of materials’
properties. At low frequencies (up to several MHz) the
inductive and capacitive elements are spatially separated
and allow well-deﬁned characterization of the magnetic or
dielectric properties of the sample piece. Such resonators
can be assembled from discrete components, i.e. a coil
wound from superconducting wire and a high-Q capaci-
tor [1]. With a parallel-coupled LC resonator, Q-values
104 have been reached at temperatures below
up to 9
0.1 K, when the solenoidal coil is wound from 25 µm Nb
wire, and the resonator is directly coupled to the gate of
a GaAs FET ampliﬁer which is operated in a 4 K envi-
ronment [2]. In our application the resonators have been
employed for low-frequency continuous-wave NMR [3].
In most measuring applications a more eﬃcient geometry
for the resonators is a planar Nb thin-ﬁlm construction
where the inductively or capacitively coupled sample is
sandwiched between two thin-ﬁlm devices (Fig. 1).

×

The sensitivity of the measurement is often determined
by the intrinsic losses of the resonator, i.e. by its unloaded
Q0 value. The magnetic susceptibility χm of the sample
changes the inductance

L = L0(1 + χm)

,

or equivalently in a capacitive measurement, the dielec-
tric susceptibility χe is seen in the capacitance

C = C0ǫ0(1 + χe) = C0ǫ

.

The frequency-dependent complex susceptibilities, χ =
χ′
iχ′′, consist of the dispersion χ′(ω) and absorption
χ′′(ω). In the case of dielectrics, the dielectric constant is
iǫ′′. L0 and C0 are constants which
usually used: ǫ = ǫ′

are deﬁned by the thin-ﬁlm component design. Usually
the sample does not ﬁll the entire active volume, which
is accounted for by introducing a ﬁlling factor, to modify
the eﬀective susceptibility (see e.g. [4]).

In Fig. 1 the resonator is driven from a constant cur-
rent source and the output voltage is proportional to the
impedance Z(ω) of the parallel LC circuit. The width of
the resonance peak is determined by the losses, while the
resonance frequency ωr depends on the real component
of the susceptibility χ′. Both quantities can be extracted
by recording the transfer function Z(ω) as a function
of ω and by ﬁtting the measured curve to the expected
impedance of the equivalent circuit.

Frequently applications are in the limit where χ(ω)

is small and one may use linear response at resonance.
Then the sensitivity of the measurement improves with
increasing Q. This limit is usually applied in continuous
wave NMR measurement, where the resonator is driven
at resonance and its output is modulated by taking the
sample through magnetic resonance, by sweeping an ex-
ternally applied magnetic ﬁeld H. Dispersion and ab-
sorption are then extracted from the resonance response

In the case of a dielectric sample the frequency shift due
to ǫ′ is typically large and requires retuning of the res-
onator from ω0 to ωr = (LC0ǫ′)−1/2. If we rewrite the
dielectric constant in the form ǫ = ǫ′ + δǫ′
iǫ′′, where δǫ′
represents small changes in ǫ′ during the measurement,
then the expression analogous to Eq. (3) becomes

II. DESIGN AND FABRICATION

Our thin-ﬁlm resonator design is shown in Fig. 2.
These devices are meant for magnetic measurements
where the sample is placed between two series-coupled
planar coils on separate substrates, in a Helmholtz-like
conﬁguration. A static polarizing magnetic ﬁeld is ap-
plied in the direction parallel to the two resonator plates.
The resonators are fabricated on ∅ 100 mm silicon and
sapphire wafers. The silicon wafers are cut from usual
micro-fabrication grade n-doped single crystal material,
with a 240 nm thick thermally oxidized SiO2 surface. The
[11¯20] sapphire wafers, with an epitaxially polished sur-
face, are used as reference substrates, to compare to a
pure material with inherently low losses. The resonator
circuit is fabricated in four layers which are summarized
in Table I. In addition, a layer of Nb2O5, made by an-
odizing Nb in the lower Nb layer, is added to some ca-
pacitors, to test the properties of this dielectric.

The Nb layers are sputter deposited. The supercon-
ducting transition temperature of three 200 nm thick Nb
test layers was measured to be 9.12 – 9.20 K, with a width
of the transition region . 5 mK. The SiO2 insulation and
passivation layers are deposited with plasma enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) from silane SiH4
gas. The ﬁrst 50 nm are deposited at 120 ◦C and the rest
at 150 ◦C. This process leaves typically a layer, which
contains impurities such as OH− radicals, and its etch
rate in HF acid is high.

fabricated components and to operate the resonator in
diﬀerent conﬁgurations. The bonding pads are designed
to be large, to allow easy electrical connections.

temperature resistance measurements for fabrication fail-
ures. Less than 10 % of the capacitors show very low re-
sistance and are assumed short circuited. The expected
value for the coil resistance is 106 kΩ at room tempera-
ture. However, only about 20 % of the coils reach this
value. Others have a reduced resistance indicating that
a parallel shunt resistance exists across some turns in
the coil. In this respect the most delicate section of the
present design is the return lead from the center of the
coil in the top most Nb layer. This lead crosses all 25
turns of the coil winding, with 50 steps in layer height.
In most cases coils with a reduced resistance at room-
temperature recover the proper value of 30 kΩ on cooling
to 77 K. To cure problems with the SiO2 insulation, some
resonators were annealed at 1000◦C for 2 h. This turned
out detrimental to the Nb ﬁlm. Other annealing eﬀorts at
a lower temperature of 800◦C were equally unsuccessful.
Otherwise the resonators are durable, both with respect
to storage at room temperature and thermal cycling to
4 K.

III. MEASUREMENT SETUP

The measuring setup is shown in Fig. 3. The resonator
is placed inside the mixing chamber of a small 3He–4He
dilution refrigerator which cools to 50 mK. To minimize
losses, the resonator is housed in an extension of the mix-
ing chamber which is machined from araldite epoxy. A
heat treated high-conductivity copper shield is inserted
between the mixing chamber and the steel vacuum jacket,
to reduce dissipation in the metal parts. A superconduct-
ing solenoid outside the vacuum jacket in the liquid He
bath is used to generate a homogenous magnetic ﬁeld
parallel to the Nb ﬁlm.

≈

Ultrasonic bonding with ∅ 25 µm Al alloy wire is used
to connect to the bonding pads on the resonators. High
Q values are achieved, even when the bonding wire is part
of the resonance circuit with two Nb-ﬁlm coils connected
in series. This indicates good contact of the bonding
wire to the Nb pad. Unfortunately the Al alloy loses its
superconductivity at a low magnetic ﬁeld (

8 mT).

The voltage across the resonator is measured with a
FET preampliﬁer operating at 4 K in the liquid He bath,
similar to that described in Ref. [1]. The resonator is
connected to the preampliﬁer via a twisted pair of super-
conducting wires. The resistance in these leads outside
the resonator loop is not critical since most of the cur-
rent ﬂow occurs within the resonator. The resonator is
excited via a transformer and a coupling capacitance Cex.
This represents a nonideal current source, especially for a
high-Q resonator, but it can be shown to be equivalent to
an ideal source if the resonator capacitance C is replaced
with an eﬀective capacitance C + Cex. Thus the feeding
capacitor Cex needs to be small with high Q, not to load
the resonator.

The liquid-He-temperature preampliﬁer is an integral
part of the resonator since measurements with Q values
approaching 105 are not possible without a high-input-
impedance device. Even so, we ﬁnd that the input FET
has a leak resistance and parasitic capacitance which load

coil while the lower (•) describes a series connection of two
coils.

IV. RESULTS ON Q VALUES

×

In Fig. 4 the temperature dependences of Q and the
resonance frequency ωr are shown for a single resonator
of the type shown in Fig. 2, with only SiO2 insulation
in the capacitors. The Q values turned out to be low,
103 at 50 mK, on both silicon and sapphire sub-
(1 – 2)
strates, and within measuring precision did not depend
on the resonance excitation level in the regime 0.01 –
1 mV across the resonator (at constant applied magnetic
ﬁeld). The resonance frequency has a maximum at about
400 mK, which corresponds to a minimum in the dielec-
tric constant of the SiO2 insulation in the capacitors.

To resolve the origin of the low Q value, the thin-ﬁlm
components were tested separately. If the thin-ﬁlm coil
on the resonator plate is replaced with an external wire-
wound Nb coil with a similar inductance and high Q
value, then the resonator Q is not signiﬁcantly changed
from those recorded in Fig. 4.
In contrast, when the
thin-ﬁlm capacitance on the resonator plate is replaced
with external low-loss capacitors [5], much higher Q val-
ues are measured, as shown in Fig. 5: Q climbs at 50 mK
105
105 with a single thin-ﬁlm coil and to 0.8
to 1.2
with two coils on diﬀerent resonator plates coupled in
series with Al bonding wires. Thus the thin-ﬁlm coils
perform well, at least in terms of their Q value. On
warming to 500 mK, the Q value drops by a factor of
3, which is approximately the same behavior as for the
complete thin-ﬁlm resonators in Fig. 4. With external
capacitances the change in resonance frequency is small,

Finally, it is instructive to note that the high Q val-
ues in Fig. 5 are sensitive to the preamliﬁer bias set-
tings. Fig. 6 shows the dependence on the gate-to-source
voltage of the input FET. An equivalent circuit for the
FET input [6] is shown in the inset where the input is
replaced with a parasitic capacitance Cp and a shunt re-
sistance Rs which both are connected in parallel to the
resonator. Their values depend on the FET bias set-
tings. The change in capacitance, as calculated from ∆ω
in Fig. 6, corresponds to 0.1 pF. To obtain the measured

V. MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECTS

The resonators turned out to be highly sensitive to ap-
plied magnetic ﬁeld. Fig. 7 shows an example where the
voltage across the resonator is recorded at resonance as
a function of magnetic ﬁeld. The resonance frequency
is not substantially changing during the measurement,
thus the changes in output voltage are due to absorption
and correspond roughly to similar changes in Q value.
The output is not reproducible from one resonator to the
next, but reproduces from one measurement to the next

FIG. 7. Examples of unstable resonator operation as a
function of the externally applied magnetic ﬁeld intensity B
at 90 mK and 440 kHz. The output voltage Vout of the pream-
pliﬁer is monitored at two diﬀerent amplitudes of resonance
excitation: The peak voltage in the thin-ﬁlm capacitors across
the SiO2 insulation corresponds to 1 mV (top) and 10 µV/m
(bottom). The resonator is fabricated on sapphire substrate.
In both panels the magnetic ﬁeld is swept twice back and
forth. Apart from the change in magnetic ﬁeld dependence,
the ac electric ﬁeld does not change the average Q value sig-
niﬁcantly at excitation levels in the 0.01 – 1 mV range.

as a function of ﬁeld for one particular resonator. At low
excitation (bottom panel) the changes in output voltage
as a function of ﬁeld have the appearance of noise, with
both positive and negative changes from the average. At
higher excitations (top panel) the changes look more like
reductions in Q value. The output appears to be inde-
pendent of the sweep rate of the magnetic ﬁeld and if the
sweep is stopped, then the last value is preserved. The
unstable behavior continues all the way to zero magnetic
ﬁeld.

The magnetic ﬁeld dependence of Q is present in simi-
lar magnitude in resonators on both silicon and sapphire
substrates, also with and without the extra Nb2O5 in-
sulation. If the thin-ﬁlm coil is replaced with a high-Q
wire-wound coil, then the output as a function of ﬁeld
remains unchanged.
In contrast, a thin-ﬁlm coil con-
nected in parallel with external high-Q capacitors pro-
duces a much more stable output as a function of ﬁeld
(at a much increased Q value). However, the thin-ﬁlm
coil also suﬀers from the magnetic ﬁeld dependence, al-
though to a smaller extent. For instance, with the two
thin-ﬁlm coils in series in Fig. 5, the changes in output

voltage are

the resonance frequency remained unchanged to within
1 Hz. This is a suﬃciently small change that it would
not be measurable for the complete resonator, where the
low Q value is determined by the capacitors. In the last
example the bonding to the coils was done with Al al-
loy wire. This results in a drastic drop in Q when the
bonding wire loses its superconductivity above 8 mT.

Our measurements suggest that the unstable magnetic
ﬁeld dependence originates primarily from the SiO2 insu-
lation: The eﬀects are strong when the thin-ﬁlm capaci-
tors are used. The thin-ﬁlm coil has a small parasitic ca-
pacitance of about 0.3 pF, which also involves the SiO2
insulation: This capacitance arises when the lead from
the center of the coil crosses over all the turns of the
planar windings. Thus the magnetic ﬁeld eﬀects of the
complete thin-ﬁlm resonator and those of the thin-ﬁlm
coil alone are scaled roughly in proportion to their ca-
pacitances with SiO2 insulation. Similar magnetic-ﬁeld-
dependent eﬀects have been observed previously in thin-
ﬁlm coils of much smaller size [7].

VI. AMORPHOUS THIN-FILM INSULATOR

Both the reduced Q of the resonators and their un-
stable losses as a function of magnetic ﬁeld have here
been traced to originate primarily from the amorphous
PECVD-deposited SiO2 insulation in the capacitors.
Amorphous dielectrics are known to be lossy and to ex-
hibit as a function of temperature a minimum in the di-
electric constant at a few hundred mK [8], as was the
case here. Recently the dielectric constant of the mul-
ticomponent glass BaO-Al2O3-SiO2 has been reported
to be sensitive to magnetic ﬁelds at temperatures of a
few mK [10,9]. These measurements were conducted at
1 kHz, whereas here we operate at a higher frequency of
400 kHz. The dielectric constant has also been found to
be sensitive to the excitation amplitude [11]. With our
low excitation levels, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant depen-
dence of the average dielectric losses or the resonance
frequency on the applied ac electric ﬁeld in the measure-
ments of Figs. 4 or 5.

In addition to the amorphous structure of the insula-
tion layer, impurities, or the interface between the di-
electric and the Nb may also contribute to the observed
eﬀects.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

The present work shows that Nb-ﬁlm fabrication meth-
ods turn out a good yield of durable resonators, and
that the sputtered Nb ﬁlm is a high-quality conductor
on a standard doped silicon substrate at frequencies of
about 1 MHz at mK temperatures. In contrast, PECVD
deposited SiO2 insulation does not reach corresponding

quality levels: Its dielectric losses are large and highly
magnetic ﬁeld dependent, even around zero ﬁeld. Ad-
ditional anodized Nb2O5 insulation did not increase the
losses and might be of better quality.

Secondly, the thin-ﬁlm inductor is of suﬃciently high
quality such that it can be used to investigate the prop-
erties of the dielectric in the capacitor, to ﬁnd better
alternatives. The resonator method with a high-Q coil
and a GaAs MESFET preampliﬁer thereby allows access
to the frequency range from 0.1 MHz up to several MHz,
which so far has been only rarely investigated in studies
of amorphous solids.

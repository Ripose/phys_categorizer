Abstract

Semi-insulating, undoped, Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (SI-U LEC) GaAs detectors have been irra-
diated with 1MeV neutrons, 24GeV/c protons, and 300MeV/c pions. The maximum ﬂuences used were 6,
3, and 1.8 1014 particles/cm2 respectively. For all three types of irradiation the charge collection eﬃciencies
(cce) of the detector are reduced due to the reduction in the electron and hole mean free paths. Pion and
proton irradiations produce a greater reduction in cce than neutron irradiation, with the pions having the
o
greatest eﬀect. The eﬀect of annealing the detectors at room temperature, at 200
C with a
ﬂash lamp have been shown to reduce the leakage current and increase the cce of the irradiated detectors.
The ﬂash-lamp anneal produced the greatest increase in the cce from 26% to 70% by increasing the mean free
path of the electrons. Two indium-doped samples were irradiated with 24GeV/c protons and demonstrated
no improvement over SI U GaAs with respect to post-irradiation cce.

Introduction

The possible use of GaAs detectors in the future ATLAS experiment at the LHC imposes severe demands on
the radiation hardness of the GaAs detectors. Semi-insulating, undoped GaAs detectors have been shown to
withstand doses up to 100Mrad of 60Co gamma rays [1]. Their sensitivity to neutrons, protons and pions are
reported in this paper.

The irradiations were performed at the ISIS facility [2] for the neutron exposure, with a spectrum strongly
peaked at 1MeV, the CERN PS for 24GeV/c protons [3] and the PSI, Villigen, for 300MeV/c pions [4]. All
irradiations were performed at room temperature.

2 The detectors

All the detectors (except for two described in section 6) were fabricated with SI U GaAs substrates [5], with
thicknesses varying from 115µm to 500µm. The substrates were lapped and polished at Glasgow University to
obtain the desired thickness. Various thicknesses were used so that the dependence of the leakage current and
charge collection eﬃciency on this parameter could be studied. All the detectors had 3mm diameter circular
pad contacts with a 200µm wide guard ring separated from the pad by 10µm. The Schottky contact on one
face of the wafer was metallized with Ti/Pd/Au and the ohmic contact on the other face was Pd/Ge annealed
at 300oC. The leakage current characteristics before and after the irradiations were obtained with a Keithley
237 voltage source measurement unit. A 90Sr source was used to determine the response of the detectors to
minimum ionising particles with an ampliﬁer shaping time of 500ns. The charge collection eﬃciencies of either
electrons or holes created in the ﬁrst 20µm of the detector thickness were obtained with the use of an 241Am
alpha particle source placed on the Schottky or ohmic contact, respectively. An ampliﬁer with a 500ns shaping
time was used. The current characteristics and charge collection eﬃciencies from the 90Sr source were obtained
at both 20oC and -10oC. The -10oC temperature was chosen as this is the proposed operating temperature of
the ATLAS semiconductor tracker.

3 Reverse Current

The eﬀect of all three types of irradiation on the reverse current characteristics of the GaAs detectors is small.
Figure 1 shows four reverse current characteristics with increasing proton ﬂuence for a 210µm thick detector
measured at 20oC. The plateau current after a ﬂuence of 8.9 × 1013 p/cm2 is only 2.2 times larger than
the pre-irradiated value. Before irradiation the detector is fully depleted at a bias, Vf d, of 250V; after only
1.56 × 1013 p/cm2 this has reduced to 160V. The value remains unchanged with higher ﬂuence. For an applied
bias greater than Vf d the signal created by irradiating the ohmic contact with an alpha source (the hole signal)
is non-zero, implying that the detector is active across the entire bulk. As the value of Vf d is reduced with
ﬂuence the extension of the high ﬁeld region in the detector changes after irradiation. The value of the reverse
current for biases greater than Vf d reduces with increased ﬂuence and the reverse current characteristic becomes
more resistive in nature. Although the reverse current at Vf d increases with dose up to 1 × 1014 p/cm2, the
majority of the increase occurs by 3 × 1013 p/cm2. From 1 × 1014 p/cm2 up to 2.4 × 1014 p/cm2 (the maximum
ﬂuence tested with this sample) the current at this bias remains approximately constant (see ﬁgure 2).

Reverse current characteristics of two detectors of diﬀerent thickness, 160µm and 500µm, both of which were
irradiated to 6 × 1013 p/cm2 are shown in ﬁgure 3. It can be seen that the value of the leakage current up to
Vf d is independent of the detector thickness. This is not the case in silicon where the leakage current, Ir, has
a dependence on ﬂuence, Φ, given by [6]

∆Ir
V ol

= αΦ

(1)

where α is the reverse current damage constant and Vol is the volume of the detector. No varriation in this
eﬀect on the leakage current has been observed for detectors that were biased during irradiation.

The forward current characteristics also change with increasing ﬂuence. The eﬀect of protons on a 160µm
thick detector, shown in ﬁgure 4, illustrates this. A plateau appears that extends to higher bias values with
increasing ﬂuence while the magnitude of the plateau current falls. This allows the detector to be operated
under forward bias.

4 Charge collection eﬃciency

The charge collection eﬃciencies for 200µm thick detectors as a function of neutron, proton and pion ﬂuence
are shown in ﬁgures 5, 6 and 7. These were measured using minimum ionising particles (mips) from a 90Sr

source at an applied bias of 200V. The reduction in cce with ﬂuence occurs at a greater rate for pions and
protons than for neutrons. A 10000 electron signal response to the 90Sr source, (≈ 40% cce), is obtained after
1.4 × 1014 n/cm2, 6.0 × 1013 p/cm2, and only 3.0 × 1013 π/cm2. The cce falls rapidly initially and then at a
In
slower rate for higher ﬂuences with the position of the change in gradient depending upon the particle type.
the ATLAS experiment at the LHC a particle ﬂux of 0.12 × 1014 π/cm2/year at the position of the GaAs wheels
has been calculated [7] for full luminosity. This means that after only two years at full luminosity the pion
ﬂuence would be suﬃcient to reduce the signal from a 200µm thick detector to approximately 10000 electrons.
The neutron ﬂux is the only other signiﬁcant contribution and this has been calculated to be a factor of 3 to
10 times less than the pions. The exact value depends upon the moderator used in the calorimeters. After the
10 years expected operational lifetime of ATLAS the neutron ﬂuence will not be enough to reduce the signal to
less than 10000 electrons.

Irradiated 200µm thick detectors biased in excess of 200V demonstrate an increase in cce. For example for
a 160µm thick detector irradiated to a ﬂuence of 1.0 × 1014 p/cm2 the signal increased from 8500 electrons at
200V to 12000 electrons at 400V. The reason for the increase in signal can be understood from the electron and
hole collection data. Before irradiation, the signal due to the holes is greater than that due to the electrons,
implying that the electrons are trapped more than the holes. The signal due to the holes however falls at a faster
rate with ﬂuence than that due to the electrons. This means that both electron and hole traps are introduced
with irradiation, while the electron trapping is the less important after irradiation contrary to what is observed
in unirradiated detectors. The electron signal, which is constant for a bias up to Vf d, rises at greater applied
biases as shown in ﬁgure 8. The hole signal remains almost constant with increasing bias after its initial steep
rise at Vf d. From this it is possible to conclude that ﬁeld-enhanced electron detrapping may be present.

As the mip signal for a GaAs detector irradiated in excess of 1.0 × 1014 p/cm2 appears to be independent
of substrate thickness, even at an applied bias much larger than Vf d, it is proposed that the carriers have a
mean free path less than or equal to the thickness of the thinnest detector tested, that is 115µm. The charge
deposited by a mip, Qdep is given by

where W is the width of the detector and dE/dx is the energy loss per unit length of detector traversed. If the
carrier has a mean free path, λ, then the charge collected, Qcol, is

5 Annealing studies

The change in the reverse current of a detector irradiated to 1.0 × 1014 p/cm2 has been measured over a period
of time greater than 1 year. The sample was stored at room temperature, which varied throughout the year
from 18oC to 25oC. All the current measurements were carried out at 20oC with the same Keithley 237 voltage
source measurement unit. The ﬁrst current measurement was performed 20 days after the irradiation period
due to the initial activity of the sample and holder preventing earlier handling. The value of the reverse current,
Ir, at Vf d reduced with time (t), in hours, with a logarithmic dependence given by

Ir × 107 = −0.063ln(t) + 2.4

The value of Vf d remained constant over this period. Some samples have shown an increase in cce over a similar
period of annealing, however this represented at most an improvement of 8% of the initial cce.

Elevated temperature annealing, for periods ranging from 15 minutes to 33 hours, was performed on six
irradiated detectors in an oven at 210oC in air without bias. The reverse current and charge collection eﬃciency
variations for a 180µm thick detector irradiated to 1.0 × 1014 p/cm2 are shown in ﬁgures 9 and 10. The reverse
current decreased after an 33 hour anneal from 0.22µA to 0.14µA (corresponding to 30nA/mm2 to 20nA/mm2)
where the unirradiated value was 0.10µA (14nA/mm2). The full depletion voltage remained unaﬀected by the
annealing. For an applied bias of 100V the cce increased from 23% to 30% for annealing times up to 5 hours.
As the bias increased, the increase in cce for the annealed detector was at a slower rate than in the pre-annealed
case, resulting in a lower cce for the annealed detectors at biases in excess of 400V. For longer anneal times the
cce decreased. For an anneal time of 33 hours, for example, the cce was only 15% at 100V rising to 22% for a
maximum applied bias of 500V.

Figure 9: The reverse current characteristics of a 180µm thick GaAs detector at 20oC before and after
1.0 × 1014 p/cm2 and after an anneal at 210oC for 33 hours.

The arsenic antisite defect in GaAs is known to anneal at temperatures in excess of 450oC [8]. As the
irradiation could produce such antisite defects the eﬀect of annealing at 450oC was investigated. A ﬂash-lamp
anneal was used to illuminate the detectors for either 30,60,90, or 120 seconds. The eﬀect was shown to be
independent of the detector side which was illuminated, demonstrating that the whole bulk was being heated.
The plateau reverse leakage current was reduced but so was the full depletion voltage. For an applied bias
greater than Vf d the annealed current was greater than before annealing with the gradient of this section of
the current characteristic being quite large. The mip cce of the detector was increased for applied biases less
than Vf d, however due to the large increase in leakage current above Vf d it was not always possible to measure
the charge collection at a higher applied bias. The increase in mip cce was due to an increase in electron mean
free path with anneal time while the hole mean free path remained unchanged. A bias of 300V, which could be
applied to a detector annealed at 450oC for 120s after a ﬂuence of 1.7 × 1014 π/cm2, gave a mip cce of 71%.
The pre-irradiation cce was 95% and the post-irradiation, pre-anneal value was 26%.

Indium doped samples

Two detectors were fabricated with 500µm thick SI GaAs doped with indium [5]. These were tested before and
after an exposure of 1.4 × 1014 24GeV/c protons/cm2. The reverse current of the detectors before irradiation
was 30nA/mm2, less than for the 500µm thick SI-U GaAs detectors. After the irradiation the value of Vf d was
reduced to only 220V, compared to 340V for the undoped sample. The current at the applied bias of Vf d was
0.4µA (57nA/mm2) which was higher than that of the undoped sample which was 0.22µA. The charge collection
eﬃciency for the indium doped samples was less that that of the undoped samples before irradiation by 20%.
After the irradiation the signal fell to 10% (6650 electrons) compared to 17% (11305 electrons), respectively,
for an applied bias of 1000V.

7 Conclusions

The changes in reverse current and charge collection eﬃciency for SI-U GaAs detectors have been studied after
irradiations with 1MeV neutrons, 24GeV/c protons and 300MeV/c pions. While the leakage current variations

are slight and pose little problem to the operation of the detectors, the fall in cce gives major cause for concern.
At a given high ﬂuence, the reduction is greater for charged hadrons than for neutrons (this diﬀerence is
discussed in detail in reference [9]). The cce falls rapidly in the ﬁrst 3 × 1013 p(π)/cm2. The reduction has
been shown to be due to both electrons and holes being trapped, with the hole mean free path aﬀected much
more dramatically. For an applied bias greater than Vf d the cce increases due to the increased signal from the
electrons. Room temperature annealing has been identiﬁed in the reverse current characteristics and a slight
improvement has also been seen in the cce. Annealing at elevated temperatures has shown beneﬁcial eﬀects in
both leakage current and cce. The eﬀect of proton irradiation on indium-doped GaAs detectors has shown the
material to be no more radiation-hard than SI-U GaAs. Further tests on diﬀerent samples should be performed.

Abstract

We present a ﬁrst experimental demonstration of a new method to extract a well-
collimated beam of ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) from a storage vessel. Neutrons with too
large divergence are not removed from the beam by an absorbing collimation, but a diﬀuse
or semidiﬀuse channel with high Fermi potential reﬂects them back into the vessel. This
avoids unnecessary losses and keeps the storage time high, which may be beneﬁcial when
the vessel is part of a UCN source with long buildup time of a high UCN density.

Many next-generation ultra-cold neutron sources employ conversion of cold neutrons in

solid deuterium or superﬂuid helium down to the ultra-cold regime EUCN ≤ 250 neV (see,

e.g., refs. [1, 2, 3, 4] and the book [5]). In a superthermal source UCN are accumulated in a

storage vessel to build up a high UCN density, from where they are extracted continuously

or periodically, depending on the speciﬁc experiment. The saturated UCN density is given

ρUCN = P τtot,

where P is the production rate per unit volume and τtot the storage lifetime of the vessel.

Any aperture reduces the storage time τtot and thus the maximum density, which in turn

reduces the extracted ﬂux.

If an experiment requires only a UCN beam with narrow

divergence, extraction without loosing unwanted neutrons would be advantageous. This

can be realised using a channel made of rough walls of high Fermi potential. Neutrons

scattered from the rough surface will start a diﬀuse motion inside the channel and, for a

suﬃciently long channel, be scattered back into the primary volume, unless they decay.

For deﬁnition of a beam in one dimension, we employ a channel made from two parallel

surfaces, either both rough or one rough the other specular (called diﬀuse and semidiﬀuse).

A diﬀuse channel of height h and length l will transmit a beam with a divergence of

p⊥ ≤ p|| · h/l. In a horizontal conﬁguration of same height with a specular lower surface

the angle of divergence is doubled, and neutrons with E⊥ ≤ mgh will also be transmitted.

Such a semidiﬀuse horizontal channel might be ideal for the spectrometer GRANIT [6],

currently being developed to measure transitions between gravitationally bound quantum

states of UCN above a mirror. Losses may appear inside the channel and due to outward

diﬀusion of neutrons.

The storage time τtot of UCN in a vessel with an extraction channel can be described

1/τtot = 1/τvol + 1/τch,

(2)

where τvol is the storage time of the vessel without extraction channel. The loss rate 1/τch

depends on the probability r that a UCN entering the channel becomes reﬂected back

into the vessel (in the following r is simply called ”reﬂectivity”) and the cross section Ach

of the channel,

1/τch = (1 − r)

¯vUCNAch
4V

.

(3)

V is the storage volume and ¯vUCN the mean UCN velocity. The reﬂectivity r can be

deduced experimentally from comparison of the semidiﬀuse (or diﬀuse) conﬁguration with

the specular at same height. It can not be directly deduced from the transmission because

of unknown losses due to wall absorption and up-scattering. A ﬁrst experiment was carried

out at the ultra-cold neutron installation PF2 [7] of the Institut Laue Langevin, Grenoble.

Figure 1: Experimental set-up (not to scale): UCN pass through the beam
guide (a) and a switch (b), which is used to either ﬁll the storage volume (V)
or empty it into the ”storage” detector (f). An UCN tight shutter (c) is used to
lock oﬀ the storage volume. The extraction channel (d) is made of two rectangular
pieces of sapphire (w: 80 mm, l: 30 mm, h: 8 mm), polished on one and rough on the
other side. They are externally connected to the Fomblin coated storage volume.
The ”transmission” detector (e) is ﬁxed to the volume via an aluminium tube (t)
(ø 90 mm, length: 80 mm) which is covered with a PET foil to eliminate randomly
scattered UCN.

The set-up is shown in Fig. 1.

The channel was made from sapphire plates which have a Fermi potential larger than

that of the Fomblin grease coating of the storage vessel. Each of the plates has a rough

and a specular surface. Thus it is possible to measure with two rough (double diﬀuse,

dd) or two specular (sp) surfaces, or with the semidiﬀuse (sd) conﬁguration with a rough

upper and a specular lower surface. Channel heights 100 µm, 500 µm and 1000 µm,

deﬁned by spacers, were used in the sd and sp conﬁgurations, the height of 1000 µm also

in the dd conﬁguration. A position sensitive CASCADE - U detector [8] detected the UCN

transmitted through the channel. Its readout structure consists of 30 horizontal stripes

covering a height of 90 mm. The stripes were merged to six larger zones with 30, 9, 9,

9, 9, and 24 mm height, respectively. The channel setup could be manually changed by

opening the vacuum on the side of the transmission detector. The horizontal alignment

5 × 10−4 mbar.

Table 1: Storage times of the Fomblin coated volume for diﬀerent measured chan-
nel heights and types: semidiﬀuse (sd), specular (sp), and double diﬀuse (dd). The
reﬂectivity is given relative to the specular channel of same height.

For each conﬁguration, we measured during an emptying time of 200 s the number of

UCN remaining in the vessel, having stored them with the shutter C closed for a holding

time of 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, or 300 s. After correcting each data point for losses during

counting, the storage time was obtained from a ﬁt of a single exponential decay to the

data. The results for the diﬀerent conﬁgurations are listed in Table 1. The channel height

0µm corresponds to the closed volume (the two plates are placed on top of each other

without spacer). This yields the unpertubed storage time τvol. From equations (2) and

(3), replacing τch by τsp for the specular, and by τsd for the semidiﬀuse channel, the

reﬂectivity is given as

r = 1 −

τsp
τsd

where we have assumed r = 0 for the specular channel. For all channel heights we

observed an increase of the storage lifetime of the semidiﬀuse conﬁguration with respect

to the specular one. For a channel height of 100 µm the reﬂectivity amounts to r ≥ 80 %.

This channel does not reduce the storage time of our vessel any more.

Figure 2 shows the vertical distribution of transmitted UCN. For the same channel

height, the total transmission decreases with addition of roughness to the surfaces. Fur-

thermore, the intensity distribution shows an attenuation of UCN with larger vertical mo-

mentum if the surfaces are changed from specular to semidiﬀuse, and to completely diﬀuse

zone 2 and 3. Zone 1 is on the top, whereas zone 6 is on the bottom. Furthermore,
zone 1 and 6 had larger active areas (see text). The resolution is not suﬃcient to

conﬁguration. The observed spatial distribution demonstrates the collimating properties

of the semidiﬀuse and diﬀuse channels.

In summary, we have shown that one may continuously extract, by a semidiﬀuse or

diﬀuse channel, a well-collimated beam of ultra-cold neutrons from a vessel without sig-

niﬁcantly diminishing its storage time. We measured UCN reﬂectivities from the channel

opening better than 80 % in this ﬁrst experimental test of a new method to be explored

further in future experiments.

An Electrostatic Lens to Reduce Parallax in
Banana Gas Detectors.

Abstract

Cylindrical ”banana” gas detectors are often used in ﬁxed-target ex-
periments, because they are free of parallax eﬀects in the equatorial plane.
However, there is a growing demand to increase the height of these detec-
tors in order to be more eﬃcient or to cover more solid angle, and hence
a parallax eﬀect starts to limit the resolution in that direction. In this
paper we propose a hardware correction for this problem which reduces
the parallax error thanks to an applied potential on the front window that
makes the electrostatic ﬁeld lines radially pointing to the interaction point
at the entrance window. A detailed analytical analysis of the solution is
also presented.

1 Introduction

So-called ”banana” detectors are large-area, one-dimensional or 2-dimensional
detectors that have a concave cylindrical detection surface. The axis of the cylin-
der passes through the sample position, and the detector is used to measure the
φ angle of scattered radiation from the sample in the case of a one-dimensional
detector, or to measure φ and z in a two-dimensional detector. The advantage
of also measuring z is that, in the case of anisotropic samples, one can extract
θ information, or in the case of isotropic samples, one can correct for the pro-
jection of the cone with opening angle φ projected onto a cylindrical surface.
Increasing the z-aperture of the detector increases of course the counting eﬃ-
ciency in the case of isotropic samples, and the spherical angle covered in the
case of anisotropic samples.

If the detecting volume has a non-negligible thickness, as is often the case for
gas detectors, ideally, along the radial line (pointing towards the sample) any
detection should give rise to an equivalent ”position” detection, which is actually
a radial direction detection. In gas detectors, this is a priori not so: the drift
ﬁeld in the detection volume is usually perpendicular to the cylindrical wall, so
there will be a dependence of the measured z-value on the exact detection point

1

along the particle path (a radial line). In the case of neutral particle detection,
the distance inside the detection volume of the detection point along the path
is usually a random variable with an exponential distribution. A very narrow
beam along a well-deﬁned angle θ will give rise to a spread in z-values. This
loss in resolution, together with a change of center of gravity of the impact
distribution, is called the parallax eﬀect.

The way to avoid this parallax error is to have the electrostatic drift ﬁeld be
radial until the ﬁnal signal generation. Of course, within a cylindrical geometry,
this will not be possible if the ﬁnal signal generating (gas ampliﬁcation) surface is
equipotential: there the ﬁeld lines will have to be perpendicular to the cylindrical
surface. But one can try to establish at least in the ﬁrst part of the drift volume a
more or less radial electric drift ﬁeld. A review of parallax correction techniques
is given in [1]. A straightforward method is to use a curved entrance window
at constant potential, as done by the authors of [2] and [3]. The problem with
this approach is of course that the conversion gap changes considerably over the
z-range and it is application-dependent if this is acceptable or not. We have
been inspired more by the technique described in [4] and [5], to turn the parallel
drift ﬁeld into a radial drift ﬁeld, at least in the ﬁrst part of the drift volume.
Given the structure of the ‘banana’ detector, we only wish to deﬂect the ﬁeld in
the z-direction. It turns out that, provided one can make a few approximations,
this problem leads to an analytic solution for the potential to be applied at the
entrance window.

2 Analytical solution.

We are looking for a potential function V (z), to be applied at the entrance
window, such that the E-ﬁeld is pointing to the sample position at the entrance
window. We assume the conversion gap d to be much smaller than the sample
distance R. As such we make the following approximation: we assume that the
normal component of the electric ﬁeld En is independent of the coordinate ρ
(measured perpendicularly on the cylinder surface inward the detection volume)
between the entrance window and the detection plane (supposed to be at an
equivalent constant potential Vc). Note that we don’t assume that the normal
component is independent of z. This is a priori justiﬁed by the smallness of the
gap compared to all other potential variations which should be of the order of
the sample distance. This results in our ﬁrst equation:

Next, we want the E-ﬁeld to be radial at the entrance window, leading to our
second equation:

En(z) =

In this equation, Et(z) is the tangent component of the E-ﬁeld at the entrance
window. It is determined by the potential gradient:

Et(z) =

dV
dz

−

(3)

Note that equations 2 and 3 are exact; our only approximation is equation 1
which we justiﬁed, and which we will verify later. The three equations give
rise to a linear diﬀerential equation in V (z). Solving this equation with the
boundary condition that at height h, the potential V (z) has to vanish (the cage
is supposed to be at ground potential), we ﬁnd:

h2 −z2
2Rd

V (z) = Vc

(cid:16)
which is nothing else but a Gaussian proﬁle. To apply such a proﬁle, a suit-
able sheet (Kapton, for instance) with straight metallic strips, connected by a
resistive voltage divider, can be applied. If the strips are regularly spaced at a
distance ∆, then of course the resistor values should be chosen as:

where rk is the resistor linking the k-th strip to the previous one, starting from
the strip in the middle (at z = 0). r is an arbitrary overall scale factor for the
resistors, which will determine the total resistance of the voltage divider.

3 Field and drift line calculation.

We apply the above potential in a speciﬁc example, namely the geometry for
the future D19 banana thermal neutron detector at the ILL: an active height
of 40cm (h = 20cm), a conversion gap of d = 2.6cm and a sample distance
of R = 70cm. There are 4cm of extra space on top and at the bottom in the
z direction: the entrance window will continue to be at ground potential over
these 4cm on each side, as well as the top cover and the bottom cover. The
detection ”plane” actually consists of a layer of cathode wires at 26 mm from
the entrance window, and a layer of anode wires at 30 mm from the entrance
window. We will consider the cathode wire plane to be an equipotential surface,
and with the applied potentials on the wires, this comes down to an equivalent
potential of Vc = 600V .

Using a 1mm

1mm grid of points in the rectangular drift volume, and
applying the relaxation method as explained on p47 of [6], iterating 3000 times
yields an accuracy of better than 30mV . The solution for the potential can be
seen in ﬁgure 1. One can check that the original goal set forth, namely that
the electric ﬁeld at the level of the entrance window points towards the sample
position, is satisﬁed to a high degree, as shown in ﬁgure 2 , which justiﬁes our
approximation after the fact.

On the entrance window and on the detection surface, the expression is exact,
and we have a linear interpolation perpendicular to the entrance window. This
is another way of stating our approximation as given in equation 1. Clearly, this
analytical expression is not a harmonic function and hence cannot be the true
solution, but when we take the diﬀerence between the numerical values given by
this expression and the values found by the relaxation technique, the diﬀerence
is less than 7.0V (maximum error in the middle of the drift volume), which is on
the 1% level. The advantage of such a simple expression over numerical results
is that solving for the drift lines is possible analytically. Indeed, working out
the diﬀerential equation for the drift line z(ρ) as a function of the condition
z(ρ0) = z0 gives us the solution:

We consider an incident beam from the sample position under an angle θ. After
having travelled a distance s in the conversion gap, the particle is at position
(ρ1 = cos θs, z1 = R tan θ + sin θs). The ray will thus give rise to hits which are
conﬁned between Re
2 ) tan θ and (R + d) tan θ. Without lens,
this ray would give rise to hits between R tan θ and (R + d) tan θ, which means
that the carrier of the hit distribution with lens is divided by 2 as compared
to without a lens. But in order to work out more accurately the improvement
upon the parallax error, we need to work out the projected conversion density.
If we consider an absorption (conversion) constant µ, the projected density
ξθ(z) of a narrow beam emanating from the sample under an angle θ can be
found by working out:

represented beams have angles 0.05,0.1,0.15,0.20 and 0.25 rad.

As such, this equation cannot be solved analytically. However, noting that

If s0(z, θ) is between 0 and smax, which comes down to requiring that z is
within the limits of the carrier of ξθ, we ﬁnally ﬁnd for the projected density of
a ray under the eﬀect of the lens:

5 Resolution improvement: an example.

We will now take as an example the case µ = 1cm−1, and the geometry of the
D19 prototype detector described earlier. If we compare the projected densities
for diﬀerent beams, we obtain proﬁles as shown in ﬁgure 3.

Figure 4: Resolution (standard deviation of projected density) as a function of
the impact position at the front window, for the cases µ = 1cm−1 and µ =
3cm−1, at a ﬁxed impact angle θ = 0.275.

We calculate the standard deviations of these distributions by numerical
integration, and also of the distributions obtained with µ = 3.0cm−1. We
obtain the result shown in ﬁgure 4. The resolutions are improved using a lens
by a factor slightly better than 2.2 for the case µ = 1cm−1 and a factor slightly
better than 3.3 for µ = 3cm−1. If we double the conversion gap (from 2.6 mm
to 5.2 mm), and we do the calculation again, we ﬁnd that for µ = 1cm−1 the
improvement is a factor of about 2.6 and for µ = 3cm−1 the improvement is
even a factor of about 5.5. This means that the relative improvement of the
resolution error due to parallax increases as well when d as well as when µ
become large. However, we should pay attention to the absolute resolutions as
a function of thickness. In ﬁgure 5, we can observe that the resolution without
lens has a saturating behavior as a function of conversion gap thickness, while
the behavior with lens is better, but more involved, in that the resolution reaches
a maximum, and then decreases when the conversion gap gets bigger.

Experimentally, the prototype has been ﬁlled with 5.5 bar of He-3. Neutrons
with a wavelength of 2.5 Angstrom are used, which comes down to a conversion
factor µ = 0.99cm−1. A Cd mask with 2 mm wide slits was put in front of
the entrance window, and a piece of plexiglass irradiated at the sample posi-
tion diﬀused the narrow neutron beam in a more or less radially uniform way.
Activating or not, the electrostatic lens, we obtain the resolutions, obtained by
ﬁtting a gaussian curve with oﬀset to the slit images using a least-squares algo-
rithm, as shown in ﬁgure 6. The resolution ﬁnds its origin in several diﬀerent
eﬀects (intrinsic gas resolution, electronic noise, quantization noise,...), but the
deterioration due to parallax is clearly visible, and is improved upon by the lens
action.

6 Conclusion

A solution has been presented to improve upon the parallax eﬀect in large-
aperture banana detectors, using an electrostatic lens. An approximate analyt-
ical expression of the expected image of a ray is deduced. Calculations indicate
that the relative improvement upon the parallax error with this method becomes
stronger when both µ and d are large. The absolute resolution, with lens, has a
more complicated behavior as a function of d. An experimental veriﬁcation of
the improvement, using the prototype of the new D19 thermal neutron detector
at the ILL, indicates qualitatively that the technique works in practice.

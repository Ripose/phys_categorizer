Abstract

A low mass time expansion chamber (TEC) has been developed to measure dis-
tributions of position and angle of the TRIUMF low energy surface muon beam
used for the TWIST experiment. The experiment is a high precision measurement
of muon decay and is dominated by systematic uncertainties, including the stability,
reproducibility, and characterization of the beam. The distributions measured by
the TEC are one essential ingredient of an accurate simulation of TWIST. The un-
certainties, which are extracted through comparisons of data and simulation, must
be known to assess potential systematic uncertainties of the TWIST results. The
design criteria, construction, alignment, calibration, and operation of the TEC are
discussed, including experiences from initial beam studies. A brief description of the
use of TEC data in the TWIST simulation is also included.

1 Introduction

The TRIUMF Weak Interaction Symmetry Test (TWIST) measures momen-
tum and angle distributions of positrons from the decay of highly polarized
positive muons, to determine precisely the decay (“Michel” [1,2,3]) parame-
ters. It uses a solenoidal spectrometer with 2 T magnetic ﬁeld consisting of 56
planar drift and proportional chambers arranged symmetrically with high pre-
cision on either side of a central foil that stops the low energy muon beam [4].
The incident polarized muon beam is directed along the axis of the solenoid
from the beam line, through the fringe ﬁeld region, and into the chamber
stack within the uniform tracking region. Following the decay of the muon,
the positron is tracked in the chambers and a high statistics decay distribution
is acquired. The ﬁrst results from the experiment have been published [5,6].
To extend those results to higher precision, and especially to analyze and as-
sess systematic uncertainties for the polarization dependent asymmetry decay
parameter Pµξ [7], a method was required to measure quickly and reliably
the muon beam characteristics near the entrance to the solenoid. While the
TWIST detector itself, speciﬁcally the ﬁrst several planes of drift chambers,
has some excellent properties for this kind of measurement, its placement is
disadvantageous. It is located after materials that contribute to multiple scat-
tering, such as a vacuum window and trigger scintillator. In addition, the
gas density at atmospheric pressure and the extra cathode layers of the ﬁrst
detector chambers add intolerable scattering sources.

1.1 Muon beam polarization

The requirements of high polarization and rapidly achieved high statistics are
satisﬁed by a beam of surface muons [8] produced at the surface of the primary
proton target from pion decay at rest. High polarization with respect to the
µ , which is exactly −1 if the Standard Model
direction of momentum ~p (P ~p
holds true) is assured, because the helicity of the muon neutrino determines
the spin angular momentum of the recoiling muon. The resulting particles
have momentum of 29.79 MeV/c and a range of only 0.15 g cm−2 in carbon.
Those that are created within the primary target, some distance from its
surface, will lose energy and undergo multiple scattering prior to escaping
into the surrounding vacuum. Some scattering can also occur in a removable
polyester gas barrier window in the beam line, of thickness 2 µm; it is used with
graphite targets to isolate emitted radioactive isotopes which would otherwise
migrate to the spectrometer. Scattering reduces the correlation of momentum
and spin directions, and thus the polarization, so it is essential to select only
those muons near the maximum momentum allowed in the decay to keep this
depolarization at a level negligible compared to the sensitivity of the TWIST

2

measurements.

If this goal is achieved, the muons transported to the end of the beam line by
magnetic elements will retain the correlation of momentum and spin direction,
µ . The ensemble polarization of the beam with respect to a beam axis ˆz, P ˆz
P ~p
µ ,
will be less than P ~p
µ for a beam of ﬁnite emittance, but no other signiﬁcant
depolarizing interactions intervene.

As the muon passes from the beam line through the solenoid fringe ﬁeld and
into the tracking region, the momentum and spin direction retain their cor-
relation (P ~p
µ is preserved), but transverse momentum components are added
in the fringe ﬁeld and an apparent depolarization with respect to the solenoid
(and beam) axis is the result, i.e., P ˆz
µ decreases. This can be modeled quite
precisely in simulations, assuming the ﬁeld shape is known suﬃciently well,
and also assuming the particle positions and momenta can be determined for
some point near the entrance to the ﬁeld.

A device to measure the beam particle positions and momentum directions has
been constructed, on the principles of the Time Expansion Chamber (TEC)
[9]. It determines the track of an ionizing particle in one dimension, transverse
to the particle’s direction, via the drift time of ionization in a relatively uni-
form drift ﬁeld. The ionization then reaches a region of higher ﬁeld where gas
ampliﬁcation takes place near a sense wire anode. Because we require beam
characteristics in both dimensions (x and y) transverse to the beam direction
(z), the TWIST TEC consists of two orthogonal modules.

2 Design, construction, and operation

Surface muons are easily scattered, so to minimize multiple scattering eﬀects,
the primary design criterion for the TWIST TEC was to maintain low mass.
The detector must also operate in the vacuum of the muon beam channel,
which in this case is not isolated from the primary production target nor from
the accelerator itself. Operation of the detector using low pressure dimethyl
ether (DME) gas allows the use of thin windows that isolate the chamber gas
from the beam line vacuum. DME, having a long drift time, small Lorentz
angle, and high primary ionization, is convenient because it is also used for
TWIST drift chambers. An automated control system ensures that this low
diﬀerential pressure is maintained. The overall length of the TEC was kept to
a minimum compatible with a reasonable track length necessary for an accu-
rate direction measurement. The beam size can range up to a few centimeters,
so a somewhat larger active area was chose, within which the only materi-
als in the beam path are the entrance and exit windows, the low pressure
chamber gas, and very thin ﬁeld cage wires required to deﬁne the drift ﬁeld.

3

The typical muon rate for TWIST measurements is up to several thousand
per second, so the device must be capable of recording such rates. Its opera-
tion should also not be compromised by typical beam contaminants such as
positrons. Even though the TEC material in the beam path has been mini-
mized, it scatters the beam too much to be used simultaneously during some
of TWIST’s high precision muon decay measurements. The primary role of
the TEC is to periodically tune and measure beam characteristics, verify sta-
bility, and detect possible changes in the beam that may have occurred in a
measurement interval during which it was removed to acquire precise muon
decay data. Therefore, another important design feature was that the detector
can be installed into and removed from the beam line quickly, conveniently,
and reproducibly.

2.1 Design of the TEC

The TEC is located directly upstream of the TWIST spectrometer and is
attached to the end of the TRIUMF M13 beam line [10] as shown in Fig. 1.
The beam passes from the ﬁnal two quadrupoles through a gate valve and
into the TEC. It then continues in vacuum through the fringe ﬁeld near the
yoke end plate until it reaches a vacuum window inside the high ﬁeld region.
From there, it passes through a variable density gas degrader, a thin trigger
scintillator, and into the TWIST detector.

As can be seen in Fig. 2, the TEC consists of two identical modules rotated 90
degrees with respect to each other and mounted in an aluminum gas box. One
module tracks the horizontal (x) position and angle of the incoming muons
and the other the corresponding vertical (y) components. Each module is 80
mm long. The active area that can be measured by the TEC is 60 mm ×
60 mm transverse to the beam, with an active length of 48 mm (24 wires
spaced by 2 mm). The gas box has 6 µm aluminized Mylar entrance and exit
windows and is nested in a vacuum box. The ﬂow of DME gas is maintained
in the gas box at a pressure of 80 mbar.

Figure 3 shows an exploded three-dimensional rendering of a TEC module.
The sense and grid planes are nominally 1.6 mm thick G-10 (epoxy/glass)
printed circuit boards (PCB’s) as are the side walls of the ﬁeld deﬁning cage.
The drift ﬁeld planes are 3.2 mm thick PCB’s. The remaining structural ele-
ments of the module are also manufactured from G-10. The connectors have
gold plated contacts in a glass-ﬁlled polyester matrix. The module is assem-
bled with nylon cap screws. All materials have been tested for compatibility
with the DME gas [11].

Each module contains a drift ﬁeld region and gas ampliﬁcation region. The

4

and the TWIST solenoid.

former consists of a four sided ﬁeld deﬁning cage with two wall elements con-
taining parallel printed circuit traces and two ﬁeld planes with 50 µm gold
plated Cu/Be wires strung across the opening. The wires of the ﬁeld plane are
electrically connected to the side wall traces through gold plated pins and a
socket assembly. The pitch of the wires and traces is 2.54 mm. To achieve a
uniform electric ﬁeld, each group of wires and traces is connected to its neigh-
bor through resistors of the same value creating a resistor chain to which high
voltage is applied. The drift cathode plane on the bottom of the ﬁeld cage is
a copper plane on a 1.6 mm G-10 substrate.

The gas ampliﬁcation region consists of a grid wire plane, a sense wire plane
and a solid cathode plane. These planes are separated by spacer planes made
of 1.6 mm G-10. A section of the wire geometry of this conﬁguration is shown
in Fig. 4. The grid and shield wires are 125 µm gold plated Cu/Be. The sense
wires are 25 µm gold plated tungsten. The signals from the 24 sense wires
are taken from the end of the PCB through a coaxial cable assembly to a
feedthrough in the gas box lid.

5

Fig. 2. TEC modules in the gas box.

When the elements of the drift ﬁeld region and gas ampliﬁcation region are
mated, the last resistor in the ﬁeld deﬁning cage is connected to the grid
plane, which is maintained at ground potential as is the ground plane on the
other side of the sense plane. As shown in Fig. 4, the sense plane is made
up of alternating sense and shield wires. Gas gain only occurs at the thinner
sense wires. The diameter of 25 µm was chosen for these wires based on our
previous study of gas gain at low pressure [12]. The shield wires screen the
induced pulses from adjacent wires and are necessary because the average
angle of the muon tracks through the TEC is quite small. This results in
signals on adjacent sense wires occurring at very nearly the same time, so the
mutually induced pulses would seriously aﬀect the rise time of these signals
and hence the accuracy of the drift time measurement.

2.2 TEC Alignment

It is important to align the TEC very accurately with respect to the TWIST
spectrometer and hence with the measured ﬁeld map. Cross-hairs were mounted
in the apertures at each end of the steel yoke of the spectrometer to deﬁne the
z axis. An optical surveying instrument (theodolite) was then used to align

6

Fig. 3. Exploded three-dimensional view of one TEC module.

Fig. 4. Sense plane geometry.

the TEC to these cross-hairs. First the x and y positions of the TEC were
adjusted to align the ﬁeld cage wires for both x and y modules, and then the
location was checked with the position of the central hole of the calibration
collimators (see Sec. 3.2). The accuracy was approximately ±250 µm. Once
this alignment was completed another optical device, a Leica TDA5005 Total
Station, was used to record the position of the TEC with respect to the M13
beam line and TWIST spectrometer.

7

The TEC gas box has been design to be removed and replaced in a very
reproducible manner using locating pins in the vacuum box. However, any time
the TEC is removed and replaced, a measurement of its position is made with
the Total Station to conﬁrm that proper alignment has been maintained.The
accuracy of this measurement is ±50 µm. It was necessary to take precautions
to avoid movement due to forces from vacuum loading of the beam line and
magnetic ﬁelds of the solenoid.

2.3 TEC operation

The optimum drift ﬁeld for the TEC was found to be approximately 16 V/mm.
The applied sense-wire high voltage is 1150 V and the shield wires are at
300 V. These voltages result in a muon track eﬃciency of essentially 100%
with typically up to 19 out of 24 wires hit per muon track (see 3.3). There are
intermittent sparks, the location and cause of which are still undetermined.
A degradation of eﬃciency over a period of weeks of operation has also been
observed, which may be a result of the sparking. Although the origins of these
eﬀects are not yet understood, the practical solution of regular replacement of
sense wire planes has been adopted.

2.4 Electronics and readout

The 24 wires of each of the TEC modules are connected to 24 channel pream-
pliﬁers mounted on the lid of the TEC gas box. The preampliﬁers were de-
veloped at Fermilab for use at their Colliding Detector Facility [13]. Each
channel has a gain of 1 mV/fC and a dynamic range of -400 fC to +20
fC. Signals are taken via 9.5 m of micro-coaxial cable to custom made post-
ampliﬁer/discriminator modules, which have sixteen channels in a single width
CAMAC module and are also used in the readout of the TWIST spectrom-
eter [4]. The resulting discriminated ECL logic signals are then sent via 15
m of twisted pair cable to a LeCroy 1877 FASTBUS TDC. These TDC’s are
multihit type, have 0.5 ns resolution and are operated in common stop mode.
The trigger signal for the TDC’s is derived from a plastic scintillator mounted
downstream of the TEC.

2.5 Gas system

The TEC gas system is required to provide a ﬂow (typ. 100 cc/min) of DME
to the TEC while maintaining a constant pressure (typ. 80 mbar) in the TEC.

8

Upstream pressure control is accomplished with an absolute pressure trans-
ducer that measures the pressure in the TEC volume. This transducer signal
is fed to a proportional-integral-diﬀerential (PID) device controlling the ﬂow
through a mass ﬂow controller in the gas supply line to the TEC. Downstream
ﬂow control is provided by a manual precision needle valve in the exhaust line
between the TEC and the exhaust pump. The observed pressure control sta-
bility, as reported by the pressure transducer, is approximately ±0.1%. The
manufacturer’s speciﬁcations for the pressure transducer indicate an absolute
accuracy (combined linearity, hysteresis and non repeatability) of ±0.25% and
a temperature drift of −0.048%/◦C at the typical operating pressure.

DME is a ﬂammable gas and it is separated from the cyclotron vacuum by thin
6 µm windows. Consequently, major design features of the gas system include
interlocks and procedures to prevent diﬀerential pressure from rupturing the 6
µm windows and to avoid ﬂammable mixtures of air and DME in the TEC. To
provide redundancy, an independent bipolar diﬀerential pressure transducer
is used to monitor continuously the diﬀerential pressure across the windows.
A programmable logic controller is used to read the various pressure, ﬂow and
other status inputs and implement the interlock logic. The system has three
modes of operation; TEC Out, Pump/Vent, and Normal Operation.

The TEC Out mode is used when the TEC has been removed from the vac-
uum box. Whether or not the TEC is in the vacuum box is detected by a
microswitch on the vacuum box mating ﬂange. In this mode, all the TEC sup-
ply and exhaust valves are forced closed, thus isolating the gas system. High
voltage to the TEC is disabled. The control system’s only active functions are
to control in a safe way the gate valve separating the TEC vacuum box from
the beam line, and the valve connecting the vacuum box to its vacuum pump
and vent ports, with interlocks based on the pressures reported by vacuum
gauges in the TEC vacuum box and the beam line.

In the Pump/Vent mode, some valves are forced open, while others are forced
closed, such that the TEC and all of the connecting supply and exhaust tubing,
which can be at sub-atmospheric pressure during normal operation, can be
pumped out through a bypass valve connecting the TEC to the TEC vacuum
box. This ensures that possible air leaks into the TEC or any of its connecting
plumbing can be discovered. The gate valve is forced closed in this mode,
isolating the TEC vacuum box from the beam line during vent and pump down
procedures. High voltage to the TEC is disabled. The bypass valve connecting
the TEC to the vacuum box can be closed to assist in locating leaks. However,
it is forced open if the diﬀerential pressure across the windows exceeds a set
point limit.

The Normal Operation mode has the most complex interlock scheme. The
bypass valve and the valve connecting the vacuum box to the vent and vacuum

9

pump ports cannot be opened. The TEC high voltage is enabled only if all
the valves in the gas supply and exhaust lines are open and the DME ﬂow to
the TEC exceeds a set point limit (typ. 30 cc/min). The gate valve can be
open only if the vacuum box and beam line pressures are satisfactory and the
diﬀerential pressure across the TEC windows is below a ﬁrst set point limit.
The gas system valves in the DME supply and exhaust lines can be open only
if the vacuum box pressure is satisfactory, and the diﬀerential pressure across
the windows is below the ﬁrst set point limit. If despite being isolated from
the gas system, the magnitude of the diﬀerential pressure continues to increase
beyond a second, higher set point limit, the bypass valve connecting the TEC
to the vacuum box is forced open to relieve the pressure across the windows.
This second limit is set at ±160 mbar, well below the ±500 mbar typically
required to rupture the windows.

3 Calibration and Tracking

3.1 Field distortion

The ﬁeld cage is used to produce a uniform drift ﬁeld for electron clusters. Ide-
ally, the ﬁeld along the drift direction is constant, E = −1000/60.96 ≈ −16.4
V/mm everywhere in the drift volume. In reality, however, the ﬁeld distribu-
tion is distorted because of the high voltage applied on the sense plane and the
electric ﬁeld penetrating from the adjacent module. The FEMLAB Program
[14] was employed to study such eﬀects. Figure 5, from the simulation of a
single module, shows that the drift ﬁeld at the center of the drift volume (i.e.,
at x = 0 for the X module) changes by about 10% over the length of the mod-
ule with the sense plane turned on (open squares), and a clear curve is visible.
Compared with the nominal -16.4 V/mm value, the ﬁeld intensity is enhanced
near the middle. When the sense plane is turned oﬀ (open circles), the ﬁeld is
reduced everywhere, such that the value near the middle is approximately the
nominal value. This indicates that the grid plane is not completely eﬀective
in shielding the drift region from the sense plane potential, but there is still
a curvature in the shape of the ﬁeld even without the sense plane eﬀect. This
is likely due to inﬂuence of the ﬁeld cage. In a test with FEMLAB, the grid
plane was extended to cover the gap between the edge of the grid plane and
the ﬁeld cage, and the ﬁeld cage wires were replaced with aluminized Mylar
strips. The edge eﬀects are then reduced signiﬁcantly. With the sense plane
oﬀ, the drift ﬁeld is nearly constant across the module (ﬁlled triangles). Be-
cause the aluminized Mylar strips introduce more multiple scattering into the
beam, they were not used in the actual TEC. Instead, ﬁeld variations were
accounted for via the position-dependent calibration procedure described in
the next section.

The active region, where the sense wires are located, is from z = 17 mm to z = 63

Another source of ﬁeld distortion comes from interference between the two
modules. Figure 6 is a contour plot of the change of ﬁeld in the drift region
of the X module when the Y module is turned on. This could bias the beam
angle measurements by up to roughly 5 mrad even though the interference
eﬀect is on the order of 1%.

ference in the x component of the ﬁeld, when the Y module is turned on, is plotted

3.2 Extraction of space-time relationship

Precise characterization of the muon beam requires an adequate space-time
relationship (STR) for a TEC cell, which is deﬁned by two neighboring shield
and grid wires with a sense wire in the middle. As discussed in the previous
section, the electric ﬁeld in the drift region is not uniform. The drift velocity
varies with the drift distance and the z position of the sense wire. A pair
of multi-hole collimators, installed 141 mm upstream and downstream with
respect to the center of the TEC gas box, is used as an external reference
system to measure the STR as a function of various operating parameters.
Each collimator, as shown in Fig. 7, consists of a square array of 7 × 7 holes,
1.2 mm in diameter, separated by 5.00 mm. The positions of holes were mea-
sured to an accuracy better than 40 µm. Calibration data were taken with a
diﬀuse beam tune so that all holes have exposure from the beam. We selected
the beam tracks with an angle near zero mrad for calibration purposes. An
example of a projection of measured positions from one row of the collimator
array is shown in Fig. 8.

box to deﬁne tracks to be used for calibration.

an example of the ﬁt quality. The cubic term reduces residuals by 10–20%;
higher order terms were found to be negligible. With d in cm and t in µs, the
linear term is of order one, while the quadratic and cubic terms are of order

While the calibration procedure has been shown to be quite adequate for the
central active area of the TEC (30×30 mm2) corresponding to the collimators
described above, it is likely that the derived STR is not as accurate at the
extremities. Collimators that cover the entire active region will be used in the
future.

Simulations with GARFIELD [15] suggest that the drift time has an almost
linear relationship with temperature and therefore gas density (as illustrated
at a ﬁeld of 16.4 V/mm in Fig. 10). Data taken at 22◦C and 25◦C conﬁrm the
temperature dependence. Because the DME gas pressure is ﬁxed at 80 mbar
and the temperature is recorded by the data acquisition system, variations of

13

the STR with the gas density have been taken into account either by taking
the calibration data under the same temperature or by linearly rescaling the
STR according to the density.

central axis for various gas temperatures.

3.3 Tracking resolution

The trigger for readout of an event in the TEC is provided by a signal from
a plastic scintillator placed after it. Associated with the trigger within a time
window of some 10 µs, one, or rarely more than one, muon may pass through
the TEC. Minimum ionizing positrons are also present in the beam, but are
detected only with very low eﬃciency in the low gas density. In fact, even
muons above 50 MeV/c are not tracked eﬃciently with 80 mbar pressure.
Regardless of the source, multiparticle (multitrack) events are rejected from
the analysis. In the track ﬁtting code, track candidate signals are identiﬁed
from diﬀerent wires within the time window. The drift time is determined
with respect to the trigger scintillator time, and the drift distance is derived
by converting from drift time with the help of the STR. The drift distance, or
transverse track position, is ﬁt versus the z position with a straight line. The
straight line is found to be a good approximation even though the solenoid
fringe ﬁeld extends to the TEC position, where it is typically about 0.1 T and
mostly in the z direction.

There are three major contributions to the resolution of the chamber: the
spread of drift times in a TEC cell, the multiple scattering eﬀect, and diﬀusion
of the electron clusters. Due to the TEC geometry, drift times within the same
cell can vary signiﬁcantly. Figure 11, obtained from a GARFIELD study for
drift ﬁeld of 16.4 V/mm, shows the variation of drift time versus z position of

14

ionization. A variation of up to 2% can be seen for an average drift distance,
equivalent to 75 ns or about 0.6 mm.

Z Coordinate (mm)

Fig. 11. Dependence of the drift time on z, from a GARFIELD study with drift
ﬁeld 16.4 V/mm for a muon track on the central axis. z = 0 mm corresponds to the
location of the sense wire and z = ±1 mm to the adjacent shield wires, while grid
wires are at z = ±0.5 mm.

The spatial resolution of an individual TEC cell is determined by ﬁtting the
tracks without including hits from that cell and then measuring the residuals.
It ranges from 150 to 350 µm, as a function of distance from the sense wire,
getting worse with increasing drift distance as shown in Fig. 12. The depen-
dence of hit resolution on drift distance is probably caused by transverse and
longitudinal diﬀusion of electron clusters. The longer the drift, the less likely
is the cluster to exceed electronic threshold due to the fact that diﬀusion sep-
arates the electrons in the cluster. On average, when there are 18 wires hit
in a track, the track angle resolution is ∼ 3 mrad while the position resolu-
tion, when extrapolated to a plane midway between the two TEC modules, is
∼ 150 µm.

As discussed in Sec. 2.3, while the tracking eﬃciency is essentially 100%, the
hit eﬃciency is not. Figure 13 is a distribution of the total number of wires hit
(of a maximum possible of 24 wires in a module) for a track as a function of
drift distance, where the ineﬃciency due to the longer drift is clearly visible.
Except for this distance correlation, the absence of a hit on a wire seems to
occur randomly along the length of the track.

are used by the TWIST group to adjust the beam and to analyze muon decay
data.

4.1 TEC measurements and implications for TWIST

The objectives for beam quality for TWIST were established early in the plan-
ning of the experiment. Simulations of a muon beam entering the solenoidal
ﬁeld showed that, to achieve the required small depolarization of order 10−3,
the beam should have an rms size of about 5 mm and rms angle of about 15
mrad in the absence of solenoid ﬁeld, at a position near the ﬁeld fringe where
radial ﬁeld components are highest when the solenoid is on. Therefore, the

16

calibration and resolution uncertainties of the TEC must be small compared
to these values.

Extensive beam studies based on TEC data with the solenoid ﬁeld oﬀ resulted
in beam characteristics that satisﬁed the requirements. The short beam mea-
surement time necessary for a precise measure of means and widths of size
and angle distributions, as well as indications of asymmetry or unusual beam
shape, allowed many diﬀerent beam tests and adjustments. The eﬀects of slits,
apertures, and absorbers in the M13 beam were observed and settings were
optimized. Quadrupole steering was minimized, and beam stability over days
and weeks was tested. Two surface muon production targets were used in the
studies. The ﬁrst was an edge-cooled graphite surface muon production target
of 10 mm length. The second was a beryllium target of 12 mm length encased
in a stainless steel water cooling jacket; it produced an asymmetric x proﬁle
some 20% larger than the graphite, thus it is considered inferior for TWIST
muon decay measurements.

When the solenoid was turned on to its full 2 T central ﬁeld, and correct
calibration of the TEC was veriﬁed, it was observed that the incoming muon
beam was steered to positive values of x and y. Figure 14 shows an xy beam
image with these conditions, from a graphite production target. Note that
the intrinsic beam size, without the TEC, is somewhat smaller than implied
by the ﬁgure, because some of the multiple scattering produced by the TEC
occurs prior to tracking in the TEC modules. While the solenoid fringe ﬁeld
does not appreciably alter the beam size, the shift of position away from the
solenoid axis, believed to be due to the interaction of the solenoid fringe ﬁeld
with beam quadrupoles and the ﬁnal beam dipole, is a cause for concern.
It reduces the polarization with respect to the solenoid axis (P ˆz
µ ), such that
it is less likely to be simulated with the high absolute precision required by
TWIST. Steering in the beam line to compensate for the fringe ﬁeld eﬀect is
being implemented for future TWIST measurements.

4.2 Use of TEC data in TWIST simulations

The Monte Carlo simulation of each TWIST event begins with the genera-
tion of an input muon. Other beam particles (muons and positrons) are also
generated, randomly correlated in time according to measured rates, to sim-
ulate the real beam environment. The muon beam distribution in position
and angle that is input to this simulation is derived from the TEC measured
particle tracks extrapolated to a z position corresponding to the middle of the
TEC. At this location, multiple scattering has an adequately small eﬀect on
the transverse (xy) proﬁle. The angular distributions then contain most of the
inﬂuence of scattering, and can be modiﬁed to account for it to some level of

Fig. 15. Two-dimensional distributions of the muon beam mean angle projected to
the y = 0 plane (θx, left) and to the x = 0 plane (θy, right) for the beam intensity
distribution shown in Fig. 14. Note that the color scales, representing the angles in
radians, are diﬀerent to show the trends more clearly.

Deconvolution of the angular distributions is carried out in the simulation. The
inputs to the simulation are: the probability of a muon at each xy position as
derived from a two-dimensional distribution such as Fig. 14, the mean angles of
the muon in x ( ¯θx) and y ( ¯θy) for each xy position as shown in Fig. 15, and the
rms of the angle distributions for each xy position. The simulation generates
an xy transverse location according to the probability of Fig. 14, using an array

with elements of 1×1 mm2 as shown in the ﬁgures. Random Gaussian numbers
are generated with mean given by the values of ¯θx and ¯θy at the xy point as in
Fig. 15. The ﬁgure shows the rotation of the angle-position correlation due to
the fringe ﬁeld of the solenoid, and the smaller divergence of the beam in the
x direction than in y, for this particular beam tune. The corresponding rms
widths used for the random numbers at each xy point are also taken from the
TEC information. However, they must be reduced compared to the measured
values, to account for the scattering added by the materials of the TEC as
the particle passes through it; this is the deconvolution. This technique is
intended to reproduce the correlations found between the angles, θx and θy,
and the positions, x and y. Correlations between θx and θy have been observed
to be very small and are not simulated.

ulation that uses a correlated deconvolution of the real distributions as an
input. The muon is scattered by the TEC entrance window (2.1 × 10−5 radia-
tion lengths) and by 3.5 cm of DME gas (1.3 × 10−5 radiation lengths) before
it reaches the TEC X module, resulting in a smearing of the measured θx.
Scattering has an even larger inﬂuence on the θy measurement as the muon
travels through another 12.0 cm of DME (4.6 × 10−5 radiation lengths) before
it reaches the Y module. The eﬀect of smearing due to scattering is compen-
sated by reducing each angle distribution width (deconvoluting) at an average
scattering position along the particle path. The deconvolution widths are de-
rived from comparisons of reconstructed TEC tracks from simulation runs with
the multiple scattering turned oﬀ and turned on. The values corresponding to
the analysis of recent data were 9.5 mrad for θx and 12.6 mrad for θy, which
are subtracted quadratically from the measured widths for each xy location.
When the distribution of angles for the entire beam is plotted, including this
contribution from multiple scattering, the lower two panes of Fig. 16 show a
12.4 mrad rms width of θx and a 20.1 mrad rms width of θy.

5 Summary

The TEC has already provided TWIST with extremely important information
about the muon beams used to make high precision measurements of muon
decay as a test of the Standard Model. In the future, we expect to be able to
improve the optimization of beam characteristics (beam size and divergence)
to provide the minimum possible depolarization of the beam as it enters the
solenoidal ﬁeld of the spectrometer. We will also be able to determine what
factors aﬀect the muon beam, and by how much. This in turn will enable us
to minimize systematic eﬀects of the muon decay parameter determinations
caused by variations in the muon beam, and also to assess accurately the
inﬂuence of residual systematics. Finally, data from the TEC will be crucial
to a reliable simulation of the muon beam, which in turn will be necessary for
the detailed simulation of all aspects of the experiment. Because the extraction
of muon decay parameters from data depends on a high precision comparison
to the simulation, the success of the experiment ultimately will depend in part
on the data supplied by the TEC.

Abstract

A photon detector for BNL experiment E949 is described. The detector
consists of a lead scintillator “sandwich” of 25 layers of 5 mm thick scintillator
BC404 and 24 layers of 2 mm lead absorber. Readout is implemented with
30-60 cm long WLS ﬁbers (BCF 99-29AA) glued into grooves in the BC404.
Average yield was measured with cosmic rays to be about 43 p.e./MeV. Ex-
truded plastic scintillation counters developed for sandwich detectors of pho-
tons for the KOPIO experiment are also described. For a 7 mm thick counter
with 4.3 m long WLS ﬁbers spaced at 7 mm a light yield of 18.7 p.e./MeV and
time resolution of 0.71 ns were obtained. A prototype photon veto module
consisting of 10 layers of 7 mm thick extruded plastic slabs interleaved with
1 mm lead sheets was tested.

1 Introduction

L → π0ν ¯ν
BNL experiments KOPIO [1] and E949 [2], to search rare kaon decays K 0
and K + → π+ν ¯ν, respectively, require extremely high detection eﬃciency of charged
particles and photons to suppress the dominant background from ordinary kaon
decays that are 10 orders of magnitude more frequent. For this purpose new photon
detectors were designed and built. Their common features are the wavelength shifter
ﬁber readout and Pb-scintillator sandwich design. In this work we report on the E949
collar endcap photon detector and the KOPIO photon veto prototype module.

2 Collar detector for E949

The E949 collar detectors (CO) are located at the upstream and downstream ends
of the detector, outside of the endcaps and near the beam axis. Their purpose is to
detect photons emitted from kaon decays in the kaon stopping target under small
polar angles. They cover the very forward region (from 0.995 > |cosΘ| > 0.97) as a
part of the E949 photon veto system.

2.1 Collar design

The assembly view of downstream CO is shown in Fig. 1. The upstream and down-

stream CO are similar in design, the diﬀerence is in the geometrical size. The CO
consist of 25 layers of 5 mm thick scintillator BC404 (Bicron, [3]) and 24 layers
of 2 mm lead absorber interleaved by 0.1 mm Tyvek reﬂector paper. The total
radiation thickness is limited by available space to ∼ 9X0.

A single plastic scintillator layer is segmented in 12 wedges (petals) forming 12
identical azimuthal sectors. The petal length is 165 mm. Light from the petals
is read out by 16 multiclad wave length shifting (WLS) ﬁbers (BCF99-29AA from

2

Bicron) which are glued into grooves in the scintillator to obtain a high light yield [4].
The grooves diverge radially along a petal with average spacing of 6 mm. The inner
end of the ﬁber is polished and aluminized. All 400 ﬁbers for each sector are bent
under angle of 90◦ and terminated in a connector. Fiber length is variable with an
average of about 45 cm.

Each absorber layer is composed of two halves of a 2 mm thick lead semicircular
annular disk. The Pb layers are laid out with a rotation angle of 30◦ relative to
the neighboring layer, providing coverage of the cracks between the Pb halves in
subsequent layers. The gaps between scintillator petals are also staggered so that
there is no projective cracks for photons over the CO face.

The sandwich assembly is compressed between a base plate and an endplate disk
by 12 standoﬀs. The standoﬀs prevent the collar elements from shifting down due
to gravity.

2.2 Construction and assembly

The scintillator petals were cut from cast sheets of BC404 scintillator with 0.1 mm
tolerance. Since the sheet has signiﬁcant thickness variation (range from 4.8 to
5.2 mm), petals were hand selected in groups of similar thickness. The petals from
the same group were laid out to form a single layer.

Sixteen symmetrically spaced U-shaped grooves were cut along the petal and
polished. Gluing was done in two steps. First, the grooves were ﬁlled with BC-600
epoxy, and the 65 cm long ﬁbers were inserted. In the second step, the glue was
applied over the ﬁbers to ﬁll any remaining gaps.

The scintillator is etched in a process that results in the formation of a micropore
reﬂector deposit over the surface. Long term eﬀect of Pb diﬀusion in the chemical
reﬂector is unknown so Tyvek sheets were used to separate the scintillator and lead.
The Tyvek also works as a reﬂector over the ﬁbers.

The most critical point in the collar assembly is the insertion of the ﬁbers in
the connector. Before gluing all ﬁbers were visually inspected and then bent over a
cylinder with diameter of 5 cm to expose cracks. The failure rate (a ﬁber is broken)
is below 0.5%. If Bicron ﬁber was bent with a radius of less than 3 cm, the crazing
of the cladding was observed to develop in the curved part for some ﬁbers. This
process takes place in a hour and continues over 24–48 hrs. After that stabilization
is observed (no additional crazing after 48 hours). The ﬁbers were routed to a
connector with a bending radius of 4 cm or larger. Even so some ﬁbers show crazing
which is not harmful as long as the number of such ﬁbers is less than 1%. Then the
ﬁbers have been glued in the connector, the ends were cut and polished. A view of
the assembled collar detector is shown in Fig. 2.

the ﬁbers have been shielded by protective cover.

2.3 Cosmic test

The detector was tested with cosmic rays. The trigger counters were placed above
and below each sector. Though the area of the trigger counters is larger than that
of a sector, the 50 cm separation selects minimum ionizing particles (MIP) with
incident angles close to normal. A MIP deposits about 25 MeV of visible energy
in the detector. A phototube is attached to the ﬁber connector through a silicone
cookie. All sectors were measured with the same photomultiplier EMI-9954 which
has a photocathode sensitivity extended in the green light region.

The average number of detected photoelectrons (p.e.) is calculated by dividing
the MIP peak position by the single electron peak position. An attenuator was
used to scale the large MIP signal to the single electron amplitude. The cosmic test
results are presented in Fig. 3. Average light yield is about 43 p.e./MeV, where
MeV is visible energy. Deviation from this value in diﬀerent sectors is ±3 p.e., this
is within the accuracy of the single electron peak calibration.

eﬃciency veto of any extra particles. It requires an extremely high photon detection
eﬃciency of better than 0.9996 per photon, without excessive loss from random
vetoes. High light yield over all detector volume and good timing are needed to
satisfy these requirements.

Lead–plastic scintillator sandwich detector is being considered for the barrel
photon veto in KOPIO. To read light from the scintillators, an embedded WLS
ﬁber readout will be used. Similar detectors were designed for BNL experiment
E787 [5] (without WLS ﬁbers) and KEK experiment E391 [6]. Thickness of the lead
sheets is considered to be 0.5–1.0 mm, and the thickness of extruded polystyrene
scintillator slabs is 7 mm. WLS ﬁbers are glued in the grooves which run along the
scintillator slabs with spacing of 10 mm. The schematic view of the barrel veto is
shown in Fig. 4.

3.2 Sandwich module design

The results of tests of single extruded counters and a sandwich module prototype
are reported in Ref. [7]. The main results for extruded counters with WLS ﬁber
readout are summarized in Table 1.

Extruded polystyrene scintillator with WLS ﬁber readout produces 0.8 of light
yield of BC404 scintillator. Single–clad (s.c.) and multi–clad (m.c.) ﬁbers provide
practically the same time resolution though in the tested conﬁguration the light
yield for m.c. ﬁbers was 20–24% higher than that for s.c. ones.

A schematic view of a sandwich element (module) which is used to build roof
and ﬂoor parts of the barrel is shown in Fig. 5. The number of lead–plastic layers
in a single module is 15. The width is 130 mm, spacing between grooves is 10 mm,

groove depth is 1.5–2.0 mm. Sandwich module is 4.2 m long without extending
ﬁbers. A phototube views a bundle of 195 WLS ﬁbers at each end providing a
both–side readout. A chemical etched reﬂector [7] is used to cover the scintillator
slabs. The scintillator and lead are glued together in a monolithic block using
an elastic polyurethane glue with high viscosity. The glue does not soak in the
micropore chemical reﬂector. After gluing the lead plates with scintillator covered
by the reﬂector we found the light output reduction of about 6%, but then no
degradation in the light yield was observed for two months. To test the mechanical
properties, a 4 m long dumb module (no ﬁbers) had been assembled (see Fig. 6).
10 layers of scintillator and lead were coupled together only by glue. An additional
layer of 0.1 mm stainless steel foil was also glued at the ﬁrst layer of the plastic.
The module sag under own weight was measured to be 4 cm after two weeks of test.
This value is close to the expected sag if the module would be a solid polystyrene.
Unique feature of the veto side wall is the bent sandwich modules assembled of
bent scintillator slabs as shown in Fig. 7. Bending with 10 cm radius can be done
heating the scintillator slabs with ﬁbers while the optical glue has not hardened yet.
This technique was successfully tested.

The sandwich prototype module was made with a length of 1 m while the length
of the WLS ﬁbers was 4.5 m, i.e. close to length in the real detector. Single–clad
BCF-92 ﬁbers were glued with 10 mm spacing. Light yield was measured to be
122 p.e. for MIP, and time resolution was 360 ps (rms). Light yield nonuniformity
along the module was measured in 10 cm steps. As shown in Fig. 8, the summed
light yield from both ends was stable with deviation ±1% from the average over
90 cm length.

energy fraction for 1 mm lead and 7 mm scintillator is about 0.39. From test
results we evaluate the photoyield to be 4.0 p.e. per MeV of the energy deposited
in both active (scintillator) and passive (lead) layers. It means we can collect 400
p.e. for a typical 100 MeV photon. Extrapolating the parameters obtained for the
prototype module, the time resolution of the veto detector is estimated to be close
to 200 ps (rms) for a 100 MeV photon. Direct extrapolation for higher energies
gives 63 ps/pEγ[GeV ]. However, at 1 GeV the time resolution includes not only
stochastic term but also the systematic constant term, which is diﬃcult to estimate.

Since the light propagation velocity in the ﬁbers was measured to be 17 cm/ns,
the accuracy of a localization of an electromagnetic shower could be about 3.4 cm
(rms) along the ﬁbers for a 100 MeV photon. The resolution in the other direction
is deﬁned by the width of the modules. For a 130 mm width we have σx=3.8 cm.

We are able to recover the shower direction measuring the center-of-gravity at
each level and drawing the line through these centers by χ2 method. This method
gives the systematic shift which was corrected. We simulated the photons irradiated
from the center of the decay region under angles in uniform populated range from
45 to 135◦. Angular resolution of 244 mrad (Eγ=100 MeV) for a typical angle of
70◦ leads to the measurement of the K 0
L decay position with an accuracy of about
40 cm.

4 Conclusion

Photon veto detectors for BNL experiment E949 were manufactured and tested with
cosmic rays. The detectors consist of 25 layers of 5 mm thick scintillator BC404 and
24 layers of 2 mm lead absorber. Readout is implemented with multi–clad WLS
ﬁbers (BCF 99-29AA) of 30-60 cm length. The average yield was measured with
cosmic rays to be about 43 p.e./MeV.

A lead–plastic scintillator sandwich veto system is designed for BNL experiment
KOPIO. The barrel veto features high light output and readout segmentation over
its thickness. To read light from the scintillators, an embedded wavelength–shifting
ﬁber readout technique will be used. A prototype photon veto module consisting of
10 layers of 7 mm thick extruded plastic slabs interleaved with 1 mm lead sheets was
tested. Single–clad BCF–92 ﬁbers of 4.5 m length spaced at 10 mm were used for
the readout. The module yielded 122 p.e. per MIP and time resolution of 360 ps.

Carbon Coated Gas Electron Multipliers

Abstract

Gas electron multipliers (GEMs) have been overcoated with a high
resistivity 1014−1015Ω/(cid:3) amorphous carbon layer. The coating avoids
charging up of the holes and provides a constant gain immediately
after switching on independent of the rate. The gain uniformity across
the GEM is improved. Coating opens the possibility to produce thick
GEMs of very high gain.

1 Introduction

The gas electron multiplier (GEM) [1,2] has proven to be a very attractive
new device especially in combination with MSGCs. Splitting the ampliﬁca-
tion in two steps allows to reduce the MSGC voltage to values safely below
sparking thresholds. The functionality of GEM-MSGCs has been demon-
strated in hadronic beams [3] and in magnetic ﬁelds up to 1 Tesla. Gains in
excess of 103 have been reached with GEMs [4] which open the perspective
to replace the MSGC by a simple passive anode structure. Many interesting
results have been published by the CERN group [4,5] and the large scale
application of the GEM is foreseen in the HERA-B experiment.[3,6]

Like in all gaseous detectors, the maximum gain of GEMs is limited by
discharges. Breakdown may occur through streamer discharge due to large
space charge densities. Gains of about 103 can be achieved in one ampli-
ﬁcation step depending on the strength and shape of the electric ﬁeld [7].
In the case of GEMs or similar devices a large ampliﬁcation gap with low
gain per unit length is preferable to a high condensed ﬁeld. Another limit-
ing factor is a possible non-uniformity of the ﬁeld caused by sharp electrode
edges or variable resistivity of insulating surfaces. The latter certainly limit
the maximum distance of the two conducting planes. Indirect indications for

surface discharges in GEMs have been reported [8]. The inhomogeneities in
the surface resistivities can be avoided by coating the surface with a slightly
conducting layer, a procedure which has been very successful with MSGCs.
Furthermore such a coating eliminates gain variations due to polarization of
the plastic and to charging up by ion deposition. These unpleasant eﬀects
have been observed in MSGCs on plastic substrates [9] and led to abandon
these devices. To avoid charging-up it was proposed to add a small amount
of water to the gas [2] which, however, may lead to fast aging [3]. The CERN
group reported measurements using GEMs with cylindrical holes where gain
variations were totally absent [4].

The following measurements have been performed with GEMs which were
overcoated with an amorphous carbon layer. The behavior before and after
the coating was compared.

2 The setup

The GEMs have been produced at the CERN workshop and coated by a
standard industrial CVD process1. The active GEM area was 35 × 27mm2
(type M) and 100 × 100mm2 (type L). The 50µm thick polyimide foil was
covered on both sides by 15µm copper, some of the foils have only 4µm
copper because of a second etching process. GEM foils of type M have a
square hole lattice with a pitch of 140µm, GEMs of type L have a staggered
structure with a minimum distance between two holes (center to center) of
140µm. The hole diameters varied between 45 and 90µm at the narrowest
part of the Kapton and 70 to 110µm at the copper layers. A top view of
typical GEM foils is shown in ﬁgure 1.

The quality of the ﬁrst small series (type M) was exceptionally poor with
large variations of the hole diameters of about 30% and many defects. All
the other GEM foils we investigated were of high quality like those shown in
the ﬁgure.

The GEMs were glued onto G10 frames and inserted in MSGCs con-
structed in such a way as to allow an easy exchange of the GEMs. With the
gluing of the GEMs onto frames special care has to be taken to the ﬂatness
of the GEMs. Variations in the distance between MSGC structure and GEM
foil lead to large gain variations.

The MSGC structure had 300µm pitch, the anodes and cathodes were 10
and 170µm wide. The gas volume of 6mm height was subdivided into two
equal halves by the GEM. We operated the MSGC+GEM with a gas mixture

of about 3.5kV /cm. The MSGC anodes were grounded. The voltages were
chosen such that the drift ﬁeld below the GEM foil was slightly higher than
above. The chamber was irradiated with Fe-55 and an α source (Ra-226).

The active area of the MSGC+GEM was scanned with a computer con-

trolled moveable table and a collimated Fe-55 source.

3 Results

3.1 Electrical properties of the GEMs

We have measured the electric resistance of the GEMs before and after the
coating. The electrical resistance of the small GEMs was about 1013Ω be-
fore and 1010Ω after the coating. The apparent resistivity of the uncoated
polyimide increases by about one and a half orders of magnitude during the
polarization process of about one day duration. Figure 2 compares its vari-
ation with time to the coated version which is completely stable. Notice the
diﬀerent scales. For the larger GEMs (type L) the resistance before coat-
ing was about 1014Ω. The reason for the higher resistance compared to the
small GEMs is not fully understood. A reason may be a diﬀerent polyimide
material or diﬀerent processing. After the coating the resistance of the large
GEMs was of the order of 1012Ω. (The resistivity of the coating was increased
to reduce dark currents.)

3.2 Energy resolution

As mentioned before, the GEMs of the ﬁrst small series (type M) show large
variations of the hole diameters. For this reason the energy resolution of the
uncoated GEMs of this type is rather poor. This is illustrated in Figure 3
where the iron spectrum is compared to that of the coated GEM. In both
cases the irradiated area is about 20mm2. Scanning with a strongly colli-
mated source we measured gain variation by a factor two whereas they are
in the range of about 10% for the coated GEM (Figure 4). The superior
behavior of the coated GEM is probably explained by its more homogenous
ﬁeld.

The large high quality GEMs (type L) showed comparable energy reso-

lutions and gain variations before and after coating.

3.3 Gain stability

For the uncoated GEMs drastic gain variations due to polarization of the
Kapton and to charging up by ion deposition are observed. Figure 5 shows
the gain as a function of time. The gain increases by about a factor of
two within 40 hours after switching on the HV. To disentangle the eﬀects
of polarization and charging-up we have measured the gain across the active
GEM area after diﬀerent time intervals. The GEM was irradiated at a ﬁxed
position near its center. The results are displayed in Figure 6. Initially the
gain was rather uniform across the GEM (curve 1). After ≈ 60 hours (curve
2) the gain has globally increased but at the irradiated spot an additional
40% increase is observed. The uniform gain increase of the whole GEM
is explained by polarization of the polyimide whereas the additional local
increase at the irradiated spot is due to charging-up by ion deposition. The
gain remains high for several days after the source has been removed.

The gain of coated GEMs is nearly stable directly after switching on the

HV. This is illustrated in Figure 7.

3.4 Maximum achievable Gain

Figure 8 shows the gas ampliﬁcation as a function of the cathode voltage
for diﬀerent constant GEM voltages. The leftmost curve is obtained with a
cathode voltage of the MSGC of 50V only which is needed solely to direct
the electrons towards the anodes. The GEM can safely be operated at gains
of a few hundred. Both the coated and uncoated GEMs start to produce
discharges at ampliﬁcation factors above 1000 (Figure 9). The discharges do
not destroy or modify the performance of the GEM.

3.5 Stability of the coating

A coated GEM has been irradiated at a GEM voltage of 500V with an α
source (Ra-226) of 5kHz per 10mm2 spot size for several days without any
deterioration, no discharges were observed. A long term aging test is still
required. However, experience with MSGCs indicate that coating should
rather improve the long term stability of gaseous detectors.

4 Conclusions and outlook

Coating of GEMs increases their performance. Instabilities due to charging
up and polarization are avoided. For a series of small GEMs with unusually
bad quality the coating improved the energy resolution and the spatial gain

uniformity. This observation may allow to relax the quality requirement for
the GEM production. The GEM quality of the larger GEMs (type L) we
investigated is much superior and their energy resolution and spatial gain
uniformity before coating was comparable to that of the coated GEMs.

At present we are studying GEMs with a 100µm thick polyimide layer.
These foils were produced at Moscow Lebedev Institute. Their ﬁrst attempt
to etch the hole structure lead to a very bad quality. The copper sticks into
the holes thus the maximum achievable voltages are limited by discharges.
However, gains in excess of a few 1000 can be reached. We expect a new series
with a second etching step which should avoid discharges and allows to verify
that the coating increases the maximum achievable voltages and gains. We
further intend to apply the coating technique to a two-dimensional detector
[10] where the holes of the CAT [11] are replaced by grooves.

ing us various GEM foils from the CERN workshop and for many critical

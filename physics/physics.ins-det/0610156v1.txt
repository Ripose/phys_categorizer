We discuss the special challenges posed by measuring diﬀractive and forward physics at the LHC
at high luminosity and the solutions proposed by the FP420 R&D collaboration.

Keywords: Soft QCD; Forward Physics; Diﬀraction.

1. Introduction

The term “high luminosity” throughout this
article is taken to mean “luminosities at
which event pile-up is signiﬁcant”.
In that
case, the rapidity gaps typical of diﬀractive
events tend to be ﬁlled in by particles from
the overlaid pile-up events. Hence the selec-
tion of diﬀractive events has to rely entirely
on tagging the diﬀractively scattered protons
which escape intact down the beam-pipe.

In recent years,

theoretical advances
have identiﬁed forward proton tagging at the
LHC as a promising tool for the search for
and the characterization of new particles at
the LHC.1 At the highest LHC luminosities,
central exclusive production (CEP) may be-
come a tool for the discovery of any object
that couples to gluons. A case in point is a
Standard Model or MSSM Higgs boson with
mass close to the current exclusion limit.
CEP would provide a clean experimental sig-
nature for its discovery; would make possible
an unambiguous determination of its quan-
tum numbers; and would oﬀer, as the sole
channel at the LHC, a direct means of mea-
suring the CP structure of the Higgs sector.2
Forward proton tagging at high lumi-
nosities will also give access to a rich QCD
program. Measuring diﬀraction in the pres-
ence of a hard scale will render possible the
investigation of fundamental aspects of the
proton structure as pioneered at HERA and
the TEVATRON. Diﬀractive Parton Distri-

bution Functions provide a view on the pro-
ton through a lens that ﬁlters out everything
but the vacuum quantum numbers; Gener-
alized Parton Distributions contain informa-
tion on the correlations between partons in
the proton. Along with these, the so-called
rapidity gap survival probability can be ex-
perimentally determined. This quantity is
closely linked to soft rescattering eﬀects and
to the features of the underlying event at the
LHC.3

2. The FP420 R&D project

For slightly oﬀ-momentum protons, the LHC
beamline with its magnets is essentially a
spectrometer. If diﬀractively scattered pro-
tons are bent suﬃciently, but little enough
to remain within the beam-pipe, they can be
detected by means of detectors inserted into
the beam-pipe and approaching the beam en-
velope as closely as possible.

At nominal LHC optics, an ideal position
is at a distance of
420 m from the interac-
tions points of the ATLAS and CMS experi-
ments, where coverage in the fractional mo-
mentum loss ξ of the proton of 0.002 < ξ <
0.02 can be achieved.

±

The FP420 R&D collaboration, with
members from ATLAS, CMS and the LHC,
aims at installing high precision tracking and
fast timing detectors close to the beam at
the 420 m location.4 The currently consid-
ered conﬁguration foresees, over a length of

10 m, 2 or 3 stations of Silicon detectors with
about 8 layers each. Fast timing detectors
complement this setup. They would be ca-
pable of determining, within a resolution of
a few millimeters, whether the tagged proton
candidates came from the same vertex as the
hard scatter.

±

The region at

420 m from the IP of AT-
LAS or CMS is located in the cold section of
the LHC. The engineering challenge of inte-
grating detectors operated at room temper-
ature into a beamline operated at cryogenic
temperatures can be resolved by eﬀecting a
cold-warm transition by means of modifying
an already existing LHC beamline element,
the LHC Arc Termination Module. The en-
gineering design work is already well under-
way.

The currently preferred solution for a
mechanism to insert the tracking detectors
into the beam-pipe and to approach them to
the beam to within about 3 mm is a movable
beam-pipe section to which the detector sta-
tions would be attached. Beam pipe section
and detectors would be kept in a position re-
mote from the beam during injection, and
would be moved as close as possible to the
beam-line once the beam has stabilized and
the narrow beam envelope of collision run-
ning has been reached.

The tracking detectors in the 420 m lo-
cation have to be suﬃciently radiation hard
to be operable in the immediate vicinity of
the LHC beam, and their insensitive area on
the side closest to the beam envelope needs
to be as small as possible to maximize accep-
tance. The technology currently foreseen is
edgeless 3-D Silicon where the electrodes are
processed inside of the Silicon bulk instead of
being implanted on its surface and where the
width of the insensitive volume at the edge
is smaller than 5 µm. In addition, this novel
type of Silicon detectors has been found to
withstand the dose expected at 420 m for
an integral of 5 years of LHC running at
10 times the LHC design luminosity. The

current prototypes utilize the radiation-hard
ATLAS pixel readout chip and were tested
in a test beam at CERN this summer.

With a Silicon detector electrode pitch of
50 µm, a resolution in the two spatial dimen-
sions of about 15 µm can be reached. Prelim-
inary Monte-Carlo simulations indicate that
for CEP of a Higgs boson with mass between
120 GeV and 200 GeV, this translates into
a mass resolution of around 1.5 GeV, when
the two protons are both detected at 420 m
(420+420 tag).

3. Pile-up background

Single diﬀractive events contribute about
15% of the inclusive QCD cross section at
the LHC, double Pomeron exchange events a
few percent. In addition, a certain portion
of non-diﬀractive events contain leading pro-
tons with a fractional momentum loss small
enough that they can be observed in near-
beam detectors. These generally soft events
with leading protons are present in the event
pile-up.

The unprecedented high luminosities at
the LHC come at the cost of event pile-up,
i.e. each hard scatter will be overlaid with
a luminosity-dependent number of generally
soft events. At an instantaneous luminosity
1, the average number is
of 2
1 it
7 events per crossing, at 1
is 35. Of these pile-up events, of the order
1% contain a proton within the acceptance
of near-beam detectors at 420 m from the
IP.

For the selection of diﬀractive events at
the LHC at high luminosities, these leading
protons from pile-up are a major background
source. To illustrate the point, we consider
the case of a Higgs boson with 120 GeV mass
that decays into a pair of b-jets. For the non-
diﬀractive production of a Higgs boson of
this mass and decay channel the background
from inclusive dijet production is overwhelm-
ing. Quantum number selection rules in the

case of CEP (i.e. double Pomeron exchange)
suppress this background to a large extent.
However, inclusive dijet events, when they
occur in coincidence with pile-up events that
have leading protons within the acceptance
of the near-beam detectors at
420 m, again
appear to have the same signature as the sig-
nal. Simple combinatorics yields as estimate
1 that of the order of a few
at 2
per mill of inclusive dijet events are being
mistaken as signal events. Given the much
larger cross section of inclusive dijet events
compared to the signal, this is the most im-
portant source of background.

This background can be reduced by ex-
ploiting the correlations between quantities
measured in the main detector and those
measured with the near-beam detectors. One
possibility is to estimate the fractional mo-
mentum loss, ξ, of the protons with the help
of the dijet system as ξ1,2 = 1

where the sum is over the two jets and η de-
notes their pseudorapidity.

Another possibility is the use of fast tim-
ing detectors that determine whether the
protons seen in the near-beam detectors
came from the same vertex as the hard scat-
ter. Fast timing detectors with an expected
vertex resolution of better than 3 mm are
Preliminary
part of the FP420 project.
Monte-Carlo studies indicate that with nom-
inal LHC running conditions a rejection of
about 97% is possible of events that appear
to be double Pomeron exchange events, but
where the protons in reality originated from
coincidences with pile-up events.

Two protoypes are currently under dis-
cussion, one using Quartz as Cherenkov
medium, the other gas. Both utilize mi-
cro channel plate photo-multipliers which are
known to have yielded a time resolution of
about 10 ps in Cherenkov-light based Time-
of-Flight detectors. Results from test-beam
measurements at Fermilab with the two pro-
totypes this summer will be available soon.

4. Detectors at 220 m distance

±

Additional near-beam detectors closer to the
IP than 420 m would increase the physics
reach for forward and diﬀractive physics, no-
tably with respect to triggering and with
respect to the acceptance for centrally pro-
duced mass states of higher values. A suit-
able location is at
220 m from the ATLAS
or CMS IP. At nominal LHC optics, detec-
tors there provide an acceptance of 0.02 <
ξ < 0.2, i.e. quite complementary to the ac-
ceptance at

420 m.

±

In CEP, the mass of the centrally pro-
duced system, M , and the fractional momen-
tum loss, ξ1, ξ2, of the two protons are corre-
lated via: M 2 = ξ1ξ2s, where √s = 14 TeV
at the LHC. This translates into a minimum
observable mass of about 30 GeV, when the
protons are seen in the 420 m detectors on
each side. For masses above about 80 GeV, a
marked increase in the eﬃciency results from
events with asymmetric ξ values, where one
proton is observed at 420 m and the other
at 220 m. At M = 200 GeV, for example,
420+420 tags limit the selection eﬃciency
to about 10%, while it is almost 90% for
420+220 tags.5

Preliminary Monte-Carlo studies indi-
cate for CEP of a Higgs boson that the
achievable mass resolution with 420+220 tag
varies between less than 3 GeV (3.5 GeV) for
ATLAS (CMS) at a Higgs mass of 120 GeV,
and less than 2.5 GeV (3 GeV) for ATLAS
(CMS) at a Higgs mass of 200 GeV.

The 420 m location is too far away for
signals to be processed within the ﬁrst level
trigger (L1) latency at both ATLAS and
CMS. Hence, events with protons tagged at
420 m need to be triggered either with the
central detector alone or with near-beam de-
tectors closer to the IP.

In the case of CEP of a Higgs boson of
120 GeV mass decaying into two b-jets, trig-
gering with central detector conditions alone
is only possible with high pT muons. About

10% of signal events are accepted by the L1
muon trigger stream. The L1 thresholds fore-
seen for dijets are generally too high. Adding
a L1 trigger stream that combines a dijet con-
dition with requiring a tag on one side at
220 m makes it possible to lower the dijet L1
thresholds suﬃciently to retain about 10% of
the signal events, while the output rate stays
within the L1 bandwidth limits for luminosi-
ties up to 2

The option of placing near-beam detec-
tors at
220 m from the ATLAS IP, which
would extend the ATLAS luminosity detec-
tor program at 240 m, is currently under in-
vestigation by several ATLAS groups. Near-
beam detectors at
220 m from the CMS
IP are foreseen as part of the TOTEM ex-
periment. The trigger and DAQ systems
of TOTEM will be integrated with those of
CMS such that joint data taking will be pos-
sible. The two collaborations are in the pro-
cess of deﬁning a joint diﬀractive and forward
physics program.7 The TOTEM Silicon de-
tectors are expected to withstand of the or-

detectors, an option that is currently under

5. Status of the FP420 R&D

project

the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in the
ﬁrst half of 2007. If ATLAS and/or CMS de-
cide to build the detectors FP420 suggests,
Technical Design Reports could be provided
to the LHCC in 2007.

Installation of the proposed detectors
could take place well after the LHC startup
phase, during the ﬁrst long break in the LHC
running schedule, possibly in 2009/2010.

6. Conclusions

Measuring diﬀractive events at the LHC at
luminosities where pile-up is present requires
forward proton tagging capabilities. A radip-
ity gap based selection is no longer possible.
The FP420 R&D project at CERN aims at
providing the appropriate means: radiation-
hard Silicon detectors located in the cold re-
gion of the LHC at
420 m from the ATLAS
or CMS IP, complemented with fast tim-
ing detectors to reject fake diﬀractive events
with protons from coincidences with pile-up
events. Ways of adding detectors at
220 m
from the IP for high-luminosity data taking
are under study and discussion in ATLAS,
CMS and TOTEM.

port systems are well underway. Engineer-
ing studies are well advanced to establish the
necessary modiﬁcations to the existing cryo-
genic LHC elements at 420 m in order to ac-
commodate detectors operated at room tem-
perature. The remaining R&D work is fully
funded till the middle of 2007.

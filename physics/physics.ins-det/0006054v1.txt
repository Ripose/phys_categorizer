Abstract

The utilisation of semiconductor materials as detectors and devices operating in high
radiation environments, at the future particle colliders, in space applications or in
medicine and industry, necessitates to obtain radiation harder materials. A system-
atic theoretical study has been performed, investigating the interaction of charged
hadrons with semiconductor materials and the mechanisms of defect creation by
irradiation. The mechanisms of the primary interaction of the hadron with the nu-
cleus of the semiconductor lattice have been explicitly modelled and the Lindhard
theory of the partition between ionisation and displacements has been considered.
The behaviour of silicon, diamond, and some AI I I BV compounds, as GaAs, GaP,
InP, InAs, InSb has been investigated. The nuclear energy loss, and the concentra-
tion of primary defects induced in the material bulk by the unit hadron ﬂuence have
been calculated. The peculiarities of the proton and pion interactions as well as the
speciﬁc properties of the semiconductor material have been put in evidence.

1 Introduction

The crystalline materials for semiconductor devices used in high ﬂuences of
particles are strongly aﬀected by the eﬀects of radiation. After the interaction
between the incoming particle and the target, mainly two classes of degra-
dation eﬀects are observed: surface and bulk material damage, due to the
displacement of atoms from their sites in the lattice. For electrons and gam-
mas the eﬀects are dominantly at the surface, while the heavy particles (pions,
protons, neutrons, ions) produce both types of damages.

Up to now, in spite of the experimental and theoretical eﬀorts, the problems
related to the behaviour of the semiconductor materials in radiation ﬁelds, the
identiﬁcation of the induced defects and their characterisation, as well as the
explanation of the degradation mechanisms are still open problems.

The utilisation of semiconductor materials as detectors and devices operating
in high radiation environments, at the future particle colliders, in space appli-
cations, in medicine and industry, makes necessary to obtain radiation harder
materials.

The diamond and diﬀerent AI I IBV compounds (GaAs, GaP, InP, InAs, InSb)
are in principle, possible competitors for silicon to diﬀerent electronic devices.
In the present paper a systematic theoretical study of the expected behaviour
of these semiconductor materials in hadron ﬁelds (protons and pions) is pre-
sented.

All analysed materials have a zinc-blend crystalline structure. Silicon is at
the base of electronic industry, diamond and the AI I IBV compounds present
attractive electrical and/or luminescence properties [1], of interest for diﬀerent
applications.

2 Interaction of charged hadrons with semiconductor materials

and mechanisms of defect creation by irradition

The charged particles interact with both atomic and electronic systems in a
solid. The total rate of energy loss, as a function of distance, is called the
stopping power. This one could, in general, be divided artiﬁcially into two
components, the nuclear and the electronic part:

(cid:16)−

dE

dx (cid:17)total

= (cid:16)−

dE

dx (cid:17)nuclear

+ (cid:16)−

dE

dx (cid:17)electronic

Roughly speaking, the energy lost due to interactions with electrons gives rise
to material ionisation, while the energy lost in interactions with nuclei is to

2

the origin of defect creation.

A comprehensive theoretical treatment of electronic stopping which covers all
energies of interest cannot be formulated simply because of diﬀerent approxi-
mations concerning both the scattering and contribution of diﬀerent electrons
in the solid. For fast particles with velocities higher then the orbital velocities
of the electron, the Bethe-Bloch formula is to be used [2]. At lower velocities,
inner electrons have velocities greater than particle velocity, and therefore do
not contribute to the energy loss. This regime was modelled by Lindhard and
Scharﬀ [3].

If the particle has a positive charge, and a velocity close to the orbital velocity
of its outer electrons, it has a high probability of capturing an electron from one
of the atoms of the medium through which it passes. This process contributes
to the total inelastic energy loss since the moving ion has to expend energy in
the removal of the electrons which it captures.

The nuclear stopping depends on the detailed nature of the atomic scattering,
and this in turn depends intimately on the form of the interaction potential. At
low energies, a realistic potential based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation
was used in the literature [3] and at higher energies, where scattering results
from the interaction of unscreened nuclei, a Rutherford collision model is to
be used.

In Figure 1, the nuclear stopping power calculated for protons and pions in
diamond, silicon and GaAs is represented, as a function of the kinetic energy
of the particle. The nuclear stopping power is greater for heavier incident
particles (protons compared with pions), and for lighter media (diamond in
comparison with silicon and GaAs). The position of its maximum is the same
for protons and pions in the same medium.

The process of partitioning the energy of the recoil nuclei (produced due the
interaction of the incident particle with the nucleus, placed in its lattice site) by
new interaction processes, between electrons (ionisation) and atomic motion
(displacements) is considered in the frame of Lindhard theory [4].

The mechanism considered in the study of the interaction between the incom-
ing particle and the solid, by which bulk defects are produced, is the following:
the particle, heavier than the electron, with electrical charge or not, interacts
with the electrons and with the nuclei of the crystalline lattice. The nuclear
interaction produces the bulk defects. As a result of the interaction, depending
on the energy and on the nature of the incident particle, one or more light
particles are formed, and usually one or more heavy recoil nuclei. These nuclei
have charge and mass numbers lower or at least equal with the medium. After
this interaction process, the recoil nucleus or nuclei, if they have suﬃcient en-
ergy, are displaced from the lattice positions in interstitials. Thus, the primary

3

knock-on nucleus, if its energy is large enough, can produce the displacement
of a new nucleus, and the process can continue as a cascade, until the energy
of the nucleus becomes lower than the threshold for atomic displacements. Be-
cause of the regular nature of the crystalline lattice, the displacement energy
is anisotropic. In the present model, averaged values for displacement ener-
gies have been considered. In the concrete evaluation of defect production,
the nuclear interactions must be modelled, see for example [5–7]. The primary
interaction between the hadron and the nucleus of the lattice presents charac-
teristics reﬂecting the peculiarities of the hadron, especially at relatively low
energies. If the inelastic process is initiated by nucleons, the identity of the
incoming projectile is lost, and the creation of secondary particles is associ-
ated with energy exchanges which are of the order of MeV or larger. For pion
nucleus processes, the absorption, the process by which the pion disappears
as a real particle, is also possible.

The energy dependence of cross sections, for proton and pion interaction with
the nucleus, present very diﬀerent behaviours: the proton-nucleus cross sec-
tions decrease with the increase of the projectile energy, then have a minimum
at relatively low energies, followed by a smooth increase, while the pion nu-
cleus cross sections present for all processes a large maximum, at about 160
MeV, reﬂecting the resonant structure of interaction (the ∆33 resonance pro-
duction), followed by other resonances, at higher energies, but with much less
importance. Due to the multitude of open channels in these processes, some
simplifying hypothesis have been done [8].

The physical quantity that characterise the primary defects is the concentra-
tion of primary radiation induced defects on the unit particle ﬂuence (CPD)
[6]. This quantity permits the correlation of damages produced in diﬀerent
materials at the same kinetic energy of the incident hadron. For the compar-
ison of the eﬀects of diﬀerent particles in the same semiconductor material,
the non ionising energy loss (NIEL) is useful.

3 Theoretical expected material behaviour

The behaviour of these materials in proton ﬁelds is characterised by the CPD.
In Figure 2, the dependence of the CPD as a function of the protons kinetic
energy and medium mass number (diamond, silicon, GaAs and InP) is pre-
sented - see references [5,9] and references cited therein. Low kinetic energy
protons produce higher degradation in all materials.

For pion induced degradation, the energy dependence of CPD and NIEL
presents two maxima, the relative importance of which depends on the tar-
get mass number: one in the region of the ∆33 resonance, more pronounced

4

for light elements and compounds containing light elements, and another one
around 1 GeV kinetic energy, more pronounced for heavy elements. At higher
energies, an weak energy dependence is observed, and a general dependence of
the NIEL can be approximated [8,10]. In Figure 3a, the CPD for all these ma-
terials is represented as a function of the pion kinetic energy and of material
average mass number.

These materials could be separated into two classes, the ﬁrst with monoatomic
materials or materials with relatively close mass numbers, and the second
comprising binary materials with remote mass numbers of the elements. In
Figures 3b and 3c respectively, the energy and mass number dependence of
the CPD for the two groups of materials are represented separately.

A slow variation of the primary defect concentration has been found for pion
irradiation of diamond, silicon, GaP and GaAs, in the whole energy range
of interest, with less than 2 displacements/cm/unit of ﬂuence. In contrast to
this situation, GaP, InAs and InSb are characterised by a low CPD in the
energy range up to 200 MeV, followed by a pronounced increase of displace-
ment concentration, to more than 8 displacements/cm/unit of ﬂuence at high
energies.

4 Summary

A systematic theoretical study has been performed, investigating the inter-
action of charged hadrons with semiconductor materials and the mechanisms
of defect creation by irradiation. The mechanisms of the primary interaction
of the hadron with the semiconductor nucleus lattice have been explicitly
modelled and the Lindhard theory of the partition between ionisation and
displacements has been considered.

The nuclear stopping power is greater for heavier incident particles (protons
compared with pions), and for lighter media (diamond in comparison with
silicon and GaAs). The position of its maximum is the same for protons and
pions in the same medium.

The behaviour of these materials in hadron ﬁelds is characterised by the CPD
and NIEL.

For protons, the low kinetic energy protons produce higher degradation in all
materials.

For pion induced degradation, the energy dependence of CPD and NIEL
presents two maxima, the relative importance of which depends on the tar-

5

get mass number: one in the region of the ∆33 resonance, more pronounced
for light elements and compounds containing light elements, and another one
around 1 GeV kinetic energy, more pronounced for heavy elements. At higher
energies, an weak energy dependence is observed. A slow variation of the pri-
mary defect concentration has been found for pion irradiation of diamond,
silicon, GaP and GaAs, in the whole energy range of interest, with less than
2 displacements/cm/unit of ﬂuence. In contrast to this situation, GaP, InAs
and InSb are characterised by a low CPD in the energy range up to 200 MeV,
(which represent the energy range up to their utilisation in pion ﬁeld is rec-
ommended), followed by a pronounced increase of displacement concentration
to more than 8 displacements/cm/unit of ﬂuence at high energies.

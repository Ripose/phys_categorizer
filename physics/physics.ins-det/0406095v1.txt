The front face of the CDF central calorimeter is being equipped with a new Preshower detector, based on
scintillator tiles read out by WLS ﬁbers. A light yield of about 40 pe/MIP at the tile exit was obtained, exceeding
the design requirements.

1. INTRODUCTION

The physics program at the Fermilab Tevatron
Collider will continue to explore the high energy
frontier of particle physics until the commission-
ing of the LHC at CERN. The luminosity increase
provided by the Main Injector requires upgrades
beyond those implemented for the ﬁrst stage of
the Tevatron’s Run II physics program.

contribution

The upgrade of the CDF calorimetry includes:
(i) the replacement during the Tevatron shutdown
in Fall 2004 of the slow gas detectors - Central
Preshower (CPR) and Central Crack (CCR) de-
tectors - with a faster scintillator version which
has a better segmentation, and (ii) the addi-
tion of timing information to both the Central
and EndPlug electromagnetic calorimeters to ﬁl-
ter out cosmic ray and beam related backgrounds.
new
Preshower detector, based on 20 mm thick scin-
tillator tiles, with a ﬁner segmentation than the
calorimeter towers, read out by a wavelength-
shifting (WLS) ﬁber loaded into a groove on
the surface of each tile. It also discusses brieﬂy
the replacement of the CCR with 5 mm thick
scintillator tiles (read out with the same tech-
nique) behind a tungsten bar in order to cover
the uninstrumented azimuthal regions of the cen-
tral calorimeter. Each WLS ﬁber is spliced to
a clear ﬁber after exiting the tile. To optimize
the ﬁnal design parameters we performed several
tests comparing diﬀerent scintillators, ﬁbers and
groove shapes.

The location of the new detectors on the front
face of the central calorimeter, where they will
sample early showers and cover the φ-cracks be-

The upgrade of the CDF Central Calorime-
ter is expected to play important roles in Run
II physics, such as soft electron tagging of b-
jets, photon identiﬁcation (ID) in SUSY events
or other new physics, and improving jet energy
resolution.

The CPR has been extensively used in electron
ID, providing about a factor 2-3 more rejection of
charged pions that pass all other cuts. This extra
rejection has been crucial in soft electron ID for
b-jet tagging, as was shown in the ﬁrst top evi-
dence paper [1]. The CPR has been used in sev-
eral publications involving photon ID. By using
conversion rates, which are energy independent,
it extended the QCD measurement of direct pho-

tons by more than 100 GeV in photon transverse
momentum PT [2].

The new CPR will also be used to improve the
jet energy resolution by both correcting for en-
ergy loss in the dead material in front of it and
adding its information in jet algorithms incorpo-
rating charged tracking. A Particle Flow Algo-
rithm (PFA) that combines calorimetric informa-
tion with tracking and shower max detector data
was tested on a Run I photon-jet data sample
and provided a 20% improvement in jet energy
resolution [3] (see Fig. 2).

The CCR, located after 10 radiation length
thick tungsten bars, has been checked for large
pulse heights in all the rare events CDF has ob-
served in Run I. The φ-cracks cover about 8% of
the central detector, and in events with multiple
electromagnetic objects, the possibility of one ob-
ject hitting the crack is substantial.

2. DETECTOR DESIGN

The new CPR will be based on 2 cm thick
scintillator tiles segmented in η and φ and read
out by a 1 mm diameter WLS ﬁber located in-
side a groove on the surface of each tile. Six
tiles (12.5x12.5 cm2 each) will cover the front
face of each calorimeter tower, assembled in 48
modules (Al shells) as shown in Fig. 3, cover-
ing the 48 central calorimeter wedges. On exiting

the tiles, the WLS ﬁbers will be spliced to clear
ﬁbers, which will terminate into plastic connec-
tors at the higher η edge of each module. There,
optical cables ∼5 m long will transmit the light
to 16-channel Hamamatsu R5900 PhotoMultiplier
Tubes (PMTs) at the back of the wedge.

The new CCR will use the same technique but
the available space limits the scintillator thickness
to 5 mm. Ten tiles, ∼5 cm wide, will cover each
φ-crack with the same calorimeter segmentation
of 10 towers/wedge.

Figure 4 shows a CPR tile with a spiral groove
path for the WLS ﬁber. To see minimum ionizing
particles (MIPs) in the CPR, we request at least 5
photoelectrons (pe) at the PMT, which means at
least 12 pe at the tile exit, after taking in account
a ∼60% signal loss due to light transmission by
ﬁber splicing and optical connector plus the clear
ﬁber attenuation length.

3. R&D RESULTS

A cosmic ray test of individual tiles inside a
light-sealed box was performed in order to com-
pare diﬀerent scintillators (Bicron 408 and scin-
tillator tiles provided by the CDF JINR Dubna
group), multiclad WLS and clear ﬁbers (Kuraray
and Pol.Hi.Tech), reﬂectors (Al foil, Tyvek paper,
3M VM2002 reﬂector), and to optimize the design
of the groove in the tile.

We studied the optical coupling between the
ﬁber and the groove, and obtained similar results
with either Bicron BC-600 glue or BC-630 grease,
about 40% more light yield than just air coupling
in a conﬁguration with a groove of square cross
section and several loops of WLS ﬁber.

We compared Dubna and Bicron 408 scintilla-
tors for diﬀerent conﬁgurations and always ob-
tained a similar response within 5% (see Fig. 5).
We therefore opted for the less expensive Dubna
scintillator. For each test we took the most prob-
able value of a ﬁt to a Landau distribution as the
pe/MIP light yield of our measurement.

Both response uniformity (better than 3%) and
light yield of tiles were found equal within errors
for two kinds of groove path, circular or sigma
(σ), passing 5 mm from the tile edges and having
a radius of 5 cm at the corners. A spiral σ-groove
was chosen, as shown in Fig. 4.

We studied two diﬀerent groove cross sectional
shapes. Originally the baseline design was based
on a square cross section, 6 mm deep, loaded with

4 or 5 glued loops of WLS ﬁber. Recently, the de-
sign was changed to a keyhole shape groove with
air coupling, which performed equally well with a
2-loop spiral, as seen in Fig. 4. For the interested
reader, Fig. 6 shows the result of our study on
the optimal number of ﬁber loops into a σ-groove
with a square cross section - 8 mm deep for this
particular test. For Pol.Hi.Tech ﬁbers the light
yield reaches a plateau at N=4 loops, after which
the gain of a bigger sampling seems to be com-
pensated by the attenuation of the longer ﬁber.
For a Kuraray Y11(250) ﬁber, whose attenuation
length is about 50 cm longer than Pol.Hi.Tech or
about one extra loop, the plateau is reached at
N=5 loops.

The concern about glue damaging ﬁbers
prompted us to study the response of diﬀerent
glued tiles over a period of 9 months. No time
decay was observed, as shown in Fig. 7. However,
to reduce assembly time and remove any concern
about gluing, we decided to use a keyhole groove
(1.8 mm deep) where no glue is needed to hold the
ﬁber.
In Fig. 8 the light yield from a 2-loop spiral
keyhole groove with air coupling (solid histogram
and ﬁt) is compared to the light yield from 4 glued
ﬁber loops in a 6 mm deep square cross sectional
groove (dash-dotted histogram). Both methods
give a similar result, ∼15% more light than 1
loop of keyhole groove (dashed histogram).
In
this test Tyvek paper and a mirrored Pol.Hi.Tech
ﬁber were used. The keyhole cross section, with
a diameter of 1.2 mm, seems to serve as an ex-
tra cladding to better trap the light lost by the
ﬁber. The spiral is limited to 2 loops, with outer
(inner) radius of 5 (4.5) cm, to mantain the ﬁber

curvature above a radius of 4 cm, critical for ﬁber
stress. With this design we obtained 38 pe/MIP
in the best conﬁguration with air coupling (test
7 in Tab. 1).

The study of the best conﬁguration with a
2-loop spiral keyhole groove in a Dubna tile is
summarized in Tab. 1. We obtained a simi-
lar light yield with either Pol.Hi.Tech or Ku-
raray Y11(250) ﬁbers, but Kuraray Y11(350)
were about 17% better (test 6 vs. test 3). The
3M reﬂector increased the light yield by 15% rel-

ative to Tyvek and provided good uniformity.
Aluminizing the end of the ﬁber left inside the
tile makes an important diﬀerence, ∼20% more
light in the 2-loop spiral. While test 7 is our ﬁ-
nal choice, we also tested that ﬁlling the keyhole
groove with grease would increase the light yield
to 44 pe/MIP, ∼15% more than air coupling.

Given the narrow width of 5 cm for the CCR
tile, a mirrored Kuraray Y11(350) ﬁber will be
loaded into a straight groove. We obtained 7
pe/MIP (the tile is 5 mm thick), which is accept-
able as we will measure electromagnetic showers
in the central calorimeter azimuthal cracks.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The CDF experiment is undergoing an upgrade
of the central calorimeter in order to mantain and
extend the Run I capabilities. Design choices
have been made to minimize cost and technical
risk. The light yield obtained exceeds the origi-
nal design requirements.

At the time of writing, the assembly of the ﬁnal
CPR modules is under way and preliminary tests
show an average light yield of 16 pe/MIP at the
PMT (after the whole optical chain, including 5
m of clear ﬁber), consistent with a light yield of
∼ 40 pe/MIP at the tile exit. The new CPR and
CCR detectors are to be installed on the front
face of the central calorimeter during Fall 2004.

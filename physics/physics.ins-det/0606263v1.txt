Abstract— The ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) together
with the pixel and the transition radiation detectors will form
the tracking system of the ATLAS experiment at LHC. It will
consist of 20 000 single-sided silicon microstrip sensors assembled
back-to-back into modules mounted on four concentric barrels
and two end-cap detectors formed by nine disks each. The SCT
module production and testing has ﬁnished while the macro-
assembly is well under way. After an overview of the layout
and the operating environment of the SCT, a description of the
readout electronics design and operation requirements will be
given. The quality control procedure and the DAQ software for
assuring the electrical functionality of hybrids and modules will
be discussed. The focus will be on the electrical performance
results obtained during the assembly and testing of the end-cap
SCT modules.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE ATLAS detector [1] is one of the two general-

purpose experiments currently under construction for the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. LHC is a proton-
proton collider with a 14-TeV centre-of-mass energy and a
design luminosity of 1034 cm−2s−1. ATLAS consists of the
Inner Detector (ID), the electromagnetic and the hadronic
calorimeters, and the muon spectrometer. The ID [2] is a
system designed for tracking, particle identiﬁcation and vertex
reconstruction, operating in a 2-T superconducting solenoid.
The Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) forms the middle layer of
the ID between the pixel detector and the transition radiation
detector.

The SCT system [2], [3], depicted in Fig. 1, comprises a
barrel made of four nested cylinders and two end-caps of nine
disks each. The cylinders together carry 2112 detector units
(modules) while 1976 end-cap modules are mounted on the
disks in total. The whole SCT occupies a cylinder of 5.6 m
in length and 56 cm in radius with the innermost layer at a
radius of 27 cm. It provides a pseudorapidity coverage of up
to ±2.5.

The silicon modules [4] consist of one or two pairs of
single-sided p-in-n microstrip sensors glued back-to-back at
a 40-mrad stereo angle to provide two-dimensional
track
reconstruction. The 285-µm thick sensors [5] have 768 AC-
coupled strips with an 80 µm pitch for the barrel and a 57–
94 µm pitch for the end-cap modules. Between the sensor

pairs there is a highly thermally conductive baseboard. Barrel
modules follow one common design, while for the forward
ones four different types exist based on their position in the
detector.

The readout of the module is based on 12 ABCD3TA
ASICs manufactured in the radiation-hard DMILL process
mounted on a copper/kapton hybrid [6]. The ABCD3TA
chip [7] features a 128-channel analog front end consisting
of ampliﬁers and comparators and a digital readout circuit
operating at a frequency of 40.08 MHz. This ASIC utilizes
the binary scheme where the signals from the silicon detector
are ampliﬁed, compared to a threshold and only the result
of the comparison enters the input register and the digital
pipeline. The clock and command signals as well as the data
are transferred from and to the off-detector electronics through
optical links.

The ID volume will be subject to a ﬂuence of charged
and neutral particles from the collision point and from back-
scattered neutrons from the calorimeters. An estimated ﬂu-
ence at the innermost part of the SCT is ∼ 2 × 1014 1-
MeV-neutrons/cm2 (or equivalently ∼ 3 × 1014 24-GeV-
protons/cm2) in ten years of operation. The SCT has been
designed to be able to withstand these ﬂuences [8] and its
performance has been extensively studied in beam tests using
irradiated SCT modules [9].

II. ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS

The LHC operating conditions demand challenging electri-
cal performance speciﬁcations for the SCT modules and the
limitations [10] mainly concern the accepted noise occupancy
level, the tracking efﬁciency, the timing and the power con-
sumption. The most important requirements the SCT module
needs to fulﬁl follow.

1) Noise performance: The total effective noise of the
modules results from two principal contributions; the front-
end electronics and the channel-to-channel threshold matching.
The former is the Equivalent Noise Charge (e− ENC) for
the front-end system including the silicon strip detector. It
is speciﬁed to be less than 1500 e− ENC before irradiation
and 1800 e− ENC after the full dose of 3 × 1014 24-
GeV-equivalent-protons/cm2. The noise hit rate needs to be
signiﬁcantly less than the real hit occupancy to ensure that
it does not affect
the pattern
recognition and the track reconstruction. The foreseen limit
of 5 × 10−4 per strip requires the discrimination level in the
front-end electronics to be set to 3.3 times the noise charge.
To achieve this condition at the ATLAS operating threshold of
1 fC, the total equivalent noise charge should never be greater
than 1900 e− ENC. Assuming a 3.3-fC median signal at full
depletion that corresponds to a median signal-to-noise ratio of
10:1.

the data transmission rate,

2) Tracking efﬁciency: In general the tracking performance
of a particle detector depends on various parameters: the radial
space available in the cavity, which limits the lever arm,
the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, and the intrinsic precision
and efﬁciency of the detector elements. To this respect a
starting requirement is a low number of dead readout channels,
speciﬁed to be less than 16 for each module to assure at least
99% of working channels. Furthermore no more than eight
consecutive faulty channels are accepted in a module.

3) Timing requirements: For a correct track reconstruction,
every hit has to be associated to a speciﬁc bunch crossing.
That is translated to a demand for a time-walk of less than
16 ns, where the time-walk is deﬁned as the maximum time
variation in the crossing of the comparator threshold at 1 fC
over a signal range of 1.25 to 10 fC. The fraction of output
signals shifted to the wrong beam crossing is required to be
less than 1%.

4) Power consumption: The nominal values for the power

supplies of the ASICs are set as follows:

• Analogue power supply: Vcc = 3.5 V ± 5%.
• Digital power supply: Vdd = 4.0 V ± 5%.
• Detector-bias: high voltage of up to 500 V can be

delivered by the ASICs.

The nominal power consumption of a fully loaded module
is 4.75 W during operation at 1 fC threshold with nominal
occupancy (1%) and 100 kHz trigger rate (L1 rate). Including
the optical readout, the maximal power dissipation should be
7.0 W for the hybrid and the heat generated in the detectors
just before thermal run-away should be 2.6 W for outer module
wafers and 1.6 W for inner ones.

5) Double pulse resolution: The double pulse resolution
directly affects the efﬁciency. It is required to be 50 ns to
ensure less than 1% data loss at the highest design occupancy.
Standard DAQ system and electrical tests, described in the
following sections, aim at verifying the hybrid and detector
functionality after the module assembly and at demonstrating
the module performance with respect to the required electrical
speciﬁcations.

III. DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM

In all the measurements performed, the ASICs are powered
and read out electrically via the standard SCT DAQ system
which contains the following VME modules:

• CLOAC (CLOck And Control): This module generates
the clock, fast trigger and reset commands for the SCT
modules in the absence of the timing, trigger and control
system.

• SLOG (SLOw command Generator): It allows the genera-
tion of slow commands for the control and conﬁguration
of SCT front-end chips for up to six modules. It fans
out clock and fast commands from an external source
(CLOAC). Alternatively an internal clock may be se-
lected, allowing SLOG to generate clock and commands
in stand-alone mode.

• MuSTARD (Multichannel Semiconductor Tracker ABCD
Readout Device): A unit designed to receive, store and
decode the data from multiple SCT module systems. Up
to 12 data streams (six modules) can be read out from
one MuSTARD.

• SCTHV: A prototype high voltage unit providing detector

• SCTLV: A custom-designed low voltage power supply

bias to four modules.

for two silicon modules.

The software package SCTDAQ [11] has been developed
for testing both the bare hybrids and the modules using the
aforementioned VME units. It consists of a C++ dynamically
linked library (STDLL) and a set of ROOT [12] macros which
analyze the raw data obtained in each test and stores the results
in a database [14]. A schematic diagram of the SCTDAQ is
shown in Fig. 2.

IV. CHARACTERIZATION TESTS

Every module is characterized to check the functionality
and performance stability and to verify that the speciﬁcations
are met. Using the internal calibration circuit to inject charge
of adjustable amplitude in the preampliﬁer of each channel,
the front-end parameters such as gain, noise and channel-to-
channel threshold spread are measured. The characterization
sequence [13] includes the following steps:

• Digital

tests are executed to identify chip or hybrid
damage. These include tests of the redundancy links,

• Optimization of the delay between calibration signal and
clock (strobe delay) is performed on a chip-to-chip basis.
• To minimize the impact of the threshold non-uniformity
across
the
ABCD3TA design foresees the possibility to adjust
the discriminator offset. A threshold correction using
a digital-to-analog converter (Trim DAC) per channel
with four selectable ranges (different for each chip) has
been implemented in the ASICs. The trimming procedure
allows an improved matching of the comparators thresh-
olds; this is an important issue for the irradiated modules
due to the increase of threshold spread with radiation
dose.

• The gain and electronic noise are obtained channel by
channel with threshold scans performed for ten different
values of injected charge ranging from 0.5 to 8 fC
(Response Curve procedure; see Fig. 4). For each charge
injected the corresponding value in mV is extracted as
the 50% point (vt50) of the threshold scan ﬁtted with a
complementary error function (S-curve). The gain, input
noise and offset are deduced from the correlation of the
voltage output in mV versus the injected charge in fC.
• A threshold scan without any charge injection is per-
formed to yield a direct measurement of the noise occu-
pancy at 1 fC, as shown in Fig. 3. The adjusted discrim-
inator offset is applied to ensure a uniform measurement
across the channels.

• A dedicated scan is also executed to determine the time-
walk. Setting the comparator threshold to 1 fC for each
value of injected charge ranging from 1.25 to 10 fC a
complementary error function is ﬁtted to the falling edge
of a plot of efﬁciency versus the setting of the strobe
delay to determine the 50%-efﬁciency point. The time-
walk is given by the difference between delays calculated
for 1.25 fC and for 10 fC injected charge.

As part of the quality assurance test, a long-term test with
electrical readout is also performed. The ASICs are powered,
least 18 hours while the
clocked and triggered during at
module bias voltage is kept at 150 V and its thermistor
temperature is ∼ 10 ◦C. The bias voltage, chip currents, hybrid
temperature, the leakage current and the noise occupancy are
recorded every 15 min, as shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, every

two hours a test verifying correct functionality of the module
is performed.

A ﬁnal measurement of the detector leakage current as a
function of the bias voltage (I − V curve) is also performed at
20 ◦C to assure that the current drawn by the whole module is
low enough for the safe operation of the detector. The current
values at 150 and 350 V are recorded and compared with those
of previous I − V curve measurements before and after the
module sub-assembly.

During the electrical tests the modules are mounted in a
light-tight aluminum box which supports the modules at the
two cooling blocks of the baseboard. The test box includes
a cooling channel connected to a liquid coolant system of
adjustable temperature. The operating temperature is moni-
tored by thermistors (one for the end-cap and two for the
barrel hybrid) mounted on the hybrid. The box also provides

a connector for dry air circulation. Subsequently, the module
test box is placed inside an environmental chamber and it is
electrically connected to the readout system and VME crate.
Up to six modules can be tested simultaneously with this
conﬁguration. The grounding and shielding scheme of the
setup is of crucial importance, therefore a careful optimization
is necessary. The tests are carried out at a detector bias of
150 V and at an operating temperature of 5 − 15 ◦C.

V. PRODUCTION MODULES PERFORMANCE

All production modules have to pass successfully the afore-
mentioned tests —long-term test, characterization and leakage
current measurement— as a part of their quality assurance
plan. The hybrids are also tested before assembly using the
same setup and software package. The results presented here
correspond to the end-cap production modules that qualiﬁed
for assembly onto disks, which amount to ∼ 2000 (including
spares) representing about half of the total number of SCT
modules.

In Fig. 6 the average gain per module is shown for all
qualiﬁed forward modules. The average gain value is about
57 mV/fC at a discriminator threshold of 2 fC and it is of the
same level as the one obtained from system tests.

The noise level per module is shown in Fig. 7. The two
distinct contributions reﬂect
the difference between short
modules (inner and short middle) and long ones (long middle
and outer). The former consist on only one pair of sensors
having a strip length of around 6 cm, while the latter have
two detector pairs with a total length of 12 cm, resulting in
higher strip resistance.

An average of 1550 e− ENC with an r.m.s. of about
100 e− ENC has been attained for the long modules. The
noise occupancy at a comparator threshold of 1 fC is measured

to be 2.4 × 10−5 on average, i.e. twenty times lower than the
requirement of < 5 × 10−4 per strip, as illustrated in Fig. 8.
These values are compatible with the ones acquired from
non-irradiated prototype modules [15], which also showed
that after irradiation the noise levels although higher do not
compromise the overall detector performance. It should be
stressed that the acquired noise measurements largely depend
on the degree of the setup optimization which generally varies
across the testing sites, resulting in a higher than actual
measured value of the module noise. The noise also depends
on the temperature on the hybrid increasing by ∼ 6 e− ENC
per degree Celsius. Since under standard conditions at the LHC
the modules will operate with a thermistor temperature near
2 ◦C, a lower noise level than the one obtained during quality
control tests is expected during running.

Another aspect of the readout requirements is the number of
defective channels per module. As shown in Fig. 9, on average

VI. CONCLUSION

The results of the systematic electrical tests performed in
all SCT forward production modules demonstrate that they
are well within speciﬁcations. The attained gain and the noise
performance are compatible with the ones obtained in several
system tests involving detector and electronics prototypes. The
fraction of defective channels per module is kept well below
1%. The production of the silicon modules has ﬁnished and
their mounting onto large structures (cylinders and disks) is
well under way. The whole SCT is expected to be ready for
installation in the ATLAS cavern at the LHC —together with
the transition radiation detector— in spring 2006.

less than three channels per module are lost, i.e., have to be
masked, which represents a fraction of 1.8h. This category
includes dead, stuck, noisy channels, as well as channels that
have not been wire-bonded to the strips and channels that
cannot be trimmed. Other channels exhibit less critical defects
such as low or high gain (or offset) with respect to the chip-
average. These faulty channels amount to less than two per
module (1.2h). Their presence is due either to chip defects or
defective detector strips (e.g. punch-through or short-circuited
channels).

As far as the ﬁnal I − V curves are concerned, the full
statistics results verify the good behavior of the sensors at a
high bias voltage. The very few cases where a problem was
observed was either due to detector damage after assembly
or to a defective bias voltage connection on the hybrid. In
the latter case the hybrids were reworked to re-establish the
connection.

To recapitulate, only a fraction of about 2.4% of the tested
modules does not pass at least one electrical characterization
test. Most of these modules exhibit a high number of consecu-
tive faulty channels due to minor damage (scratch) of module
components such as the sensors or the fan-ins.1 The high yield

1The fan-ins are designed to provide electrical connection between the
ABCD chips and the silicon strips and mechanical support between the hybrid
and the sensors. They are made out of metal tracks deposited on top of a glass
substrate.

Abstract

Three dimensional ﬁeld conﬁguration has been simulated for a simple wire chamber
consisting of one anode wire stretched along the axis of a grounded square cathode
tube by solving numerically the boundary integral equation of the ﬁrst kind. A
closed form expression of potential due to charge distributed over ﬂat rectangular
surface has been invoked in the solver using Green’s function formalism leading to
a nearly exact computation of electrostatic ﬁeld. The three dimensional solver has
been employed to study the eﬀect of several geometrical attributes such as the aspect
ratio (λ = l
d , deﬁned as the ratio of the length l of the tube to its width d) and the
wire modelling on the ﬁeld conﬁguration. Detailed calculation has revealed that the
ﬁeld values deviate from the analytic estimates signiﬁcantly when the λ is reduced to
2 or below. Although the deviation is more towards the cathode surface in general,
a noticeable departure is observed very close to the anode wire. The estimate of
the electrostatic ﬁeld at a close proximity of 1µm to the wire yields a remarkable
deviation from the analytic values. The relative deviation of the present calculations
from the analytic solution is more when the wire is modeled as a polygon while it
becomes negligible in case of thin-wire approximation (a << r), a being the radius
of the wire and r the distance of the observation point.

1 Introduction

Wire chambers are peerless tracking devices employed wherever it is necessary
to detect and localize radiation. Starting from its application in nuclear and
subnuclear physics, it has been employed in widely diﬀerent ﬁelds such as biol-
ogy, medicine, space, industrial radiology, over last three decades or more. The
normal operation of a wire chamber is based on the collection of the charges
created by direct ionization of the gas medium by the passage of radiation. The
charges are collected on the electrodes by application of an electric ﬁeld across
the chamber. From the electric pulses, thus generated, the relevant informa-
tion regarding the radiation is extracted. The ﬂexibility in the design of wire
chambers allows for highly innovative and often considerably complex ones
necessitating meticulous investigations on their structure and performance.
The study of the electrostatic ﬁeld plays a key role in optimizing the design
of these state of the art detectors to get a desired conﬁguration for the ﬁeld
in a given volume as per the tracking requirement. The analytic solution of
the ﬁeld conﬁguration for a speciﬁc geometry is always the best choice to
do the same. However, the analytic solution can be derived for severely re-
stricted geometries which is often not applicable to realistic and complicated
wire chambers [1,2]. The diversity in the chamber design necessitates applica-
tion of other techniques for numerical estimation like Finite Element Method
(FEM) and Finite Diﬀerence Method (FDM) [3,4]. FEM is more widely used
for the reason that it can seamlessly handle any arbitrary geometry including
even dielectrics. However, FEM has several drawbacks as well. It computes
only the potential from which the electrostatic ﬁeld can be obtained through
numerical diﬀerentiation. The ﬁeld values thus calculated, are unacceptable in
the regions where the ﬁeld gradient changes rapidly. Moreover, the interpola-
tion of potential at the non-nodal points reduces accuracy signiﬁcantly. The
other approach which can yield nominally exact result is Boundary Integral
Equation (BIE) method. This method is less popular due to its complicated
mathematics and inaccuracies near the boundaries. However, for the present
problem of computation of electrostatic ﬁeld in wire chambers, BIE method is
reasonably more suitable. It can provide accurate estimate of the electrostatic
ﬁeld at any arbitrary point by employing Green’s function formulation which
is necessary to study the avalanche happening anywhere in the chamber due
to the passage of radiation. A brief comparison of BEM, the numerical imple-
mentation of BIE method, with FEM and FDM in the context of calculating
three dimensional ﬁeld conﬁguration in wire chambers has been presented in
[5].

The major drawback of BEM is related to the approximations involved in
its numerical implementation. The approximations give rise to the infamous
numerical boundary layer where the method suﬀers from gross inaccuracies
[6]. This may lead to inaccurate estimation of electrostatic ﬁeld conﬁguration

2

which is not desirable in the close vicinity of the wires or the cathode. Recently,
we have made a novel approach in the formulation of BEM using analytic
expressions for potential and electrostatic ﬁeld which leads to their nominally
exact evaluation. The analytic expressions being valid throughout the physical
volume, the formulation is capable of yielding accurate values even in the near-
ﬁeld region. The application of this Nearly Exact Boundary Element Method
(NEBEM) solver [7] for the estimation of electrostatic ﬁeld in a wire chamber
of elementary geometry and the new results have been presented in this paper.

2 Present Approach

For electrostatic problems, the BIE can be expressed as

φ(~r) =

G(~r, ~r

)ρ(~r

)dS

′

′

′

ZS

where φ(~r) represents potential at ~r integrating the integrand over boundary
surface S, ρ(~r′) the charge density at ~r′ and G(~r, ~r′) = 1/4πǫ|~r − ~r′| with
ǫ being the permittivity of the medium. The BIE is numerically solved by
discretizing the charge carrying surface S in a number of segments on which
uniform charge densities ρ are assumed to be distributed. The discretization
leads to a matrix representation of the BIE as follows

A · ρ = φ

where Aij of A represents the potential at the mid-point of segment i due to
a unit charge density distribution at the segment j. For known potential φ,
the unknown charge distribution ρ is estimated by solving Eqn.(2) with the
elements of inﬂuence matrix A modeled by a sum of known basis functions
with constant unknown coeﬃcients.

In the present approach, namely NEBEM, the inﬂuences are calculated using
analytic solution of potential and electrostatic ﬁeld due to a uniform charge
distribution over a ﬂat rectangular surface. The expression for the potential
φ at a point P (X, Y, Z) in free space due to uniform unit charge density
distributed on a rectangular surface having corners at (x1, 0, z1) and (x2, 0, z2)
as shown in Fig.1 can be represented as a multiple of

the Eqn.(3). This can be expressed as follows.

In the present problem, two diﬀerent modelling schemes of the wire have been
used to study the ﬁeld conﬁguration. When the wire has been modeled as

a polygon, the above expressions from Eqn.(4)- Eqn.(8) have been employed
to estimate the potential and the electrostatic ﬁeld. In the other model, the
wire has been considered as a thin wire where the radius of the wire a has
been assumed to be small compared to the distance r of the observation point
(a << r). The expression for the potential at any point due to a wire element
along Z-axis is the following.

3 Numerical Implementation

The present problem studied with the NEBEM is to compute the electrostatic
potential and ﬁeld for a simple geometry consisting of a single anode wire run-
ning along the axis of a square tube. A schematic diagram of the wire chamber
has been illustrated in Fig.2. The anode wire has been supplied a positive high
voltage of 1000V olt and the surrounding cathode tube is grounded. Several

the square tube are represented by l and d respectively. The anode wire along its
axis has diameter 2a. The wire is supplied a voltage +V and the cathode is kept
grounded.

cases for altered tube cross section (d × d), length (l), wire diameter (2a) as
well as wire modelling have been studied. The four ﬂat rectangular surfaces
in this chamber have been segmented in to 21 × 21 elements. The wire when
considered as a polygon has been modeled with 12 surfaces each divided in 21
axial rectangular segments. The maximum number of elements in the inﬂuence
matrix has become 2016 with polygon representation while it has reduced to
1785 for thin-wire representation. The maximum user time has reached ap-
proximately ten minutes on a Pentium IV machine with 2GB RAM running
Fedora Core 3. It should be noted here that if only the mid-plane estimates
of the wire chamber are of importance, the computation time can be reduced
drastically by using even one element in the axial direction resulting into less
than 100 slender elements in total for the present problem.

4 Results

The NEBEM calculations for potential and normal electrostatic ﬁeld (Y -
component) at the mid-plane of the chamber have been compared with the
analytic estimates of an inﬁnitely long tube provided by the Garﬁeld code
[9] to demonstrate the accuracy of the solver. In Fig.3 and Fig.4, the re-

7

sults are shown for a variation in the tube cross-section from 5mm × 5mm
to 16mm × 16mm with wire diameter 50µm, the wire being modeled as a
polygon. The aspect ratio, λ = l
d, has been kept 10 to retain the property
of inﬁniteness so as to compare with analytic estimates of an inﬁnitely long
tube. The comparison shows an excellent agreement over the whole range of
In Fig.4, the ﬁeld values have been calculated at a spatial
tube dimensions.

ues computed throughout the cross-section of the tube by the NEBEM agree
excellently with the analytic calculation except at very close vicinity to the
anode wire which will be discussed later.

The NEBEM is a full-ﬂedged three dimensional solver and hence the eﬀect of λ
of the tube on the ﬁeld conﬁguration can be studied using it. From several such
studies it has been observed that the departure from the analytic solutions for
an inﬁnitely long tube becomes signiﬁcant when λ is reduced to 2 and below.
This has been illustrated in Fig.5 by plotting the relative deviation of normal
electrostatic ﬁeld between the analytic and the NEBEM calculations, deﬁned
as

The calculation has been done for the mid-plane of the tube for a wide vari-
ation in λ. The cross-section of the tube has been considered to be 10mm ×
10mm with wire diameter 50µm modeled as both polygon and a thin wire.
It has been seen that with the polygon model, the relative deviation towards

the cathode or the body of the tube becomes apparent (close to 1%) as λ is
dropped down to 2. It enhances up to 10% near the cathode surface while more
than 2% near the anode wire when λ is still reduced to 1. The results obtained
with thin-wire approximation agree with the analytic values with the relative

9

deviation being less than 0.05% towards the cathode and even less near the
anode at larger λs. The eﬀect of reduction in λ is similar to that observed in
the polygon model.

Since NEBEM can evaluate three dimensional ﬁeld at any point in the phys-
ical volume including the near-ﬁeld region, a study has been carried out to
calculate the ﬁeld values at a close proximity of 1µm only to the anode wire.
A signiﬁcant diﬀerence has been noticed between the present results and the
analytic values. Although this has been illustrated in Fig.4, it is not clearly
visible in the ﬁgure. In order to facilitate this comparison, the present results
have been presented numerically in Table 1 which contains the ﬁeld values for
a tube with λ = 10. As is evident from the values, the NEBEM results at 1µm
away from the anode wire are signiﬁcantly lower than the analytic results. The
latter can be reproduced when the wire is represented by a thin-wire model for
obvious reason. It should be noted from the Table 1 that the relative deviation

at 1µm away from the anode wire is as large as 25% with the polygon model
while for a thin-wire model of the wire, the relative deviation is only 0.003%.
The reduction in λ down to 1 reduces the former to 23%. It has been noted
that even with the thin-wire representation which can reproduce the analytic
estimates for all cases presented above, the drop in λ to 1 makes the deviation
as large as 18%.

Finally, the variation of normal electrostatic ﬁeld along the axial direction of
the tube has been studied which has been plotted in Fig.6. The tube dimen-
sion has been considered to be 10mm × 10mm × 100mm with wire diameter
50µm. The calculations have been carried out at three diﬀerent transverse
locations as indicated in the ﬁgure. The middle line represents the calculation
done at halfway between the anode and the cathode. The two dimensional
analytic solutions provided by the Garﬁeld code have been illustrated in three
dimension by the lines representing the uniform ﬁeld conﬁguration through-
out the length. The NEBEM results reproduce the two dimensional analytic
values for more than 85% of the tube length. However, in the remaining 15%
towards the ends, the three dimensional eﬀects are non-negligible. Even more
important point to be noted here is that the NEBEM calculation produces

10

perfectly smooth variation of the ﬁeld with a spatial frequency of 10µm only
while signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations are known to be present in FDM, FEM and usual
BEM solvers because of their strong dependence on nodal properties. This re-
markable feature of the present solver should allow more realistic estimation
of the electrostatic ﬁeld of various gas detectors resulting into better gain
estimations.

5 Conclusion

The three dimensional NEBEM solver has yielded several signiﬁcant observa-
tions in the electrostatic ﬁeld conﬁguration of a wire chamber of elementary
geometry. It has been found that the modelling of the anode wire plays an im-
portant role in the ﬁeld conﬁguration which leads to a departure of about 25%
from the analytic estimate at a very close proximity of 1µm near the anode
wire which is within the region of prime importance in the study of avalanche
in wire chambers. The disagreement can be accounted for with the thin-wire
approximation as expected since the same approximation is used in the an-
alytic calculations. The NEBEM solver has also exhibited the eﬀect of ﬁnite
geometry on the ﬁeld conﬁguration. The ﬁeld values even at the mid-plane of
the chamber start to show a departure from the analytic ones calculated for
inﬁnitely long chamber when λ of the chamber is reduced to 2 and below. Even
the thin-wire approximation can not reduce the deviation below 18% when λ
is made 1. The simple but robust formulation of the solver using closed form

11

expressions can also be used to solve for wire chambers of other geometries.
Since the solver can produce very smooth and precise estimate of three dimen-
sional electrostatic ﬁeld even in the near-ﬁeld region, it should be very useful
in providing important information related to the design and interpretation
aspects of a wire chamber.

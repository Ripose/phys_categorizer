Abstract

In this paper we propose a new concept for streamer quenching in Resistive Plate
Chambers (RPCs). In our approach, the multiplication process is quenched by the
appropriate design of a mechanical structure inserted between the two resistive
electrodes. We show that stable performance is achieved with binary gas mixtures
based on argon and a small fraction of isobutane. Fluorocarbons, deemed responsible
for the degradation of the electrode inner surface of RPC detectors, are thus fully
eliminated from the gas mixture. This design also resulted in a simpliﬁed assembly
procedure. Preliminary results obtained with a few prototypes of “Mechanically
Quenched RPCs” and some prospects for future developments are discussed.

1 Introduction

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), gaseous detectors with parallel resistive
plates [1,2], can provide both good spatial information and time resolution in
detecting charged particles over large areas at low cost.

Besides the traditional use of RPCs as a low cost coarse tracker, to identify
muons and provide an estimate of their momenta, new prospects for their
applications as the active part of a digital hadron calorimeter at the Inter-
national Linear Collider experiment [3] and for X- or gamma-source imaging
[4] are emerging. These are spurring again the R&D program toward a reli-
able detector, suited for large scale application in modern experiments, where
industrial standards for mass production with quality control and assurance
and stable performance over the long term are compulsory.

RPCs can be operated in avalanche mode and in streamer mode. The former
has an advantage in terms of a higher rate capability, while the latter car-
ries an advantage in terms of larger signals (order of 100 pC). A typical gas
mixture for RPC operated in streamer mode consists of argon (Ar), butane
(C4H10) and a non-ﬂammable ﬂuorocarbon (freon). The ternary mixtures have
been proved to provide stable operation with high eﬃciency to detect mini-
mum ionising particles. Operations without freon have also been studied by
many groups and various types of freon-less gas mixtures or mixtures with
very low freon concentration have been reported [5,6,7,8,9,10]. An interesting
alternative to freon is the use of SF6, which has a very high electron aﬃn-
ity and enables for reasonable streamer quenching at concentrations as small
as 1% [11]. These attempts, however, never resulted in a large scale applica-
tion of RPCs, where non-ﬂammable and low cost gas mixtures are required.
Thus, gas mixtures with a large fraction of an environmentally friendly freon,
the tetraﬂuoroethane (CH2FCF3) known as HFC-134a , are commonly used
[12,13]. It is however desirable not to use these gases in the future, as they
are being recognised as the main source of RPC instability in the long term.
Indeed, by decomposition of the tetraﬂuoroethane, under electrical discharges,
hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) can be formed, which is a very aggressive one and is
expected to have a main role in damaging the RPC inner surface [14]. In par-
ticular, the corrosive eﬀect of HF in RPC detectors with glass electrodes is a
fully ﬂedged phenomenon [15,16]. HF acid has long been known in glass and
silicon industry for its etching properties, indeed.

In this paper we propose a new concept for streamer quenching, based on a
completely diﬀerent approach. We argue that the role of the freon gas can
be fully replaced by the appropriate design of a mechanical structure inserted
between the two resistive electrodes. In practice this is achieved by introduc-
ing a honeycomb structure opaque to UV photons between the two resistive

2

electrodes to keep the streamer conﬁned in one single cell. There are several
technical problems that need to be addressed: the honeycomb material should
be an excellent insulator; the cell dimensions must be tuned to the streamer
area; the cell walls must be thin enough to avoid a geometrical loss of eﬃ-
ciency; a way to let the gas ﬂow through the chamber need to be found. Yet
a material almost ideal for this kind of application is commercially available.

In the following, after the description of the mechanical realisation of the ﬁrst
prototypes and of the experimental setup adopted for a preliminary charac-
terisation of the detectors, we show that stable performance is achieved with
binary gas mixes based on argon and a small fraction of isobutane.

2 Detector description and measurement setup

The basic element of our “Mechanically Quenched” RPCs is a ECA-I core
honeycomb structure 1 , made by an aramid ﬁbre paper coated with phenolic
resin. This material has a high strength-to-weight ratio, is electrically insulat-
ing, chemically, corrosion and ﬂame resistant. Honeycomb sheets are available
with hexagonal cell sizes from 3.2 mm to 19.2 mm diameter and minimum
thickness of 2 mm. The cell walls are less than 50 µm thick for the lowest
cell sizes, giving a geometric ﬁll-factor, deﬁned as the ratio of the potentially
active area to the total area, in excess of 90% for 3.2 mm wide hexagonal cells.
Moreover, a direct measurement of the light transmission through the aramid
ﬁbre paper have shown that the cell walls are opaque to UV photons up to
360 nm and transmit only about 10% of the visible light.

We constructed test RPCs 20×20 cm2 in size using resistive electrodes of 2 mm
thick ﬂoat glasses with 4 × 1012 Ωcm bulk resistivity at room temperature.
One honeycomb foil 2 mm thick with 3.2 mm hexagonal cells was inserted be-
tween the electrodes. An external frame of polycarbonate, to which the glass
electrodes were glued, guaranteed the gas tightness of the chamber (see Figure
1). This assembly procedure was simpler than for standard RPCs, as the hon-
eycomb sheet guaranteed a constant gap between the electrodes with no need
for speciﬁc spacers. Prototypes with 3 mm thick glasses were also built and
tested, but the high bulk resistivity of the glass batch used for these chambers
(> 1013 Ωcm) resulted in poor performance. The high voltage was supplied
to the outside surface of the glasses by a thin pre-coated paint (silk screen
printed) covering an area of 18×18 cm2 with 200-400 kΩ/✷ resistivity. The
signal was readout on external pickup copper electrodes, covered with a PET
sheet for electrical insulation from the chamber. In most of the measurements,

one single copper readout pad, covering the entire detector surface was used,
thus no position information was available. Both analog and digital readout of
the signal was performed, to measure the streamer charge, the chamber noise
(single count rate) and the time resolution. Digital information was obtained
after signal discrimination with -30 mV threshold.

The performance of the RPC prototypes was tested with cosmic rays. The
coincidence of two scintillators, placed above and below the chambers, pro-
vided a trigger over an area of about 8×8 cm2 around the chamber centre.
At every trigger, the ADC (LeCroy 2249A) and TDC (LeCroy 2228A) infor-
mation were readout, as well as the content of a scaler, which recorded the
single rate and the three fold coincidences of each chamber with the two scin-
tillators. For charge measurements, the ADC gate was set to 250 ns, well in
excess of the pulse duration, and the pulses were attenuated by 12 dB at the
ADC input to match the ADC dynamical range. The start to the TDC for
time measurements was given by the bottom scintillator, with one stop for
each RPC.

As the honeycomb structure was expected to play the role of HFC-134a in

4

conﬁning the transverse dimensions of the streamer, the RPCs were tested with
binary Ar/isobutane non-ﬂammable mixtures. The isobutane concentration
was varied from 2% to 8% by means of rotameters. The range of operations
of the rotameters available for this test implied a relatively high gas ﬂow rate
of around 50 cc/min in total, corresponding to the change of one chamber
volume every 2 min, approximately. The gas inlet and outlet were located on
the external frame of the RPCs (see Fig. 1) and no special care was taken in
the design of the chamber to ease the gas ﬂow through the honeycomb. This
might require further consideration in the future. It is an experimental fact
that, at the ﬂow rates used in these tests, there is enough room for the gas to
ﬂow between the inner surface of the electrodes and the honeycomb sheet 2 .

3 Detector performance

A preliminary characterisation of the detector performance was accomplished
by studying the detection eﬃciency to cosmic rays, the signal pulse shape and
the time resolution. The results reported hereafter describe the performance
of the two RPC prototypes assembled with 2 mm thick glass electrodes. After
assembly, the RPC prototypes were ﬂuxed, at the above mentioned rate, with
an Ar/isobutane 97/3 mixture and conditioned at 5 kV for about one week,
until stable eﬃciency and single count rate were achieved.

3.1 Eﬃciency and single count rate

The eﬃciency plateau and the single count rate curves of the RPC for several
Ar/isobutane mixtures are shown in Fig. 2. The curves shift toward higher
voltages when increasing the fraction of isobutane. At small isobutane frac-
tions (<4%) the chamber was not eﬃcient, as secondary streamers were not
suﬃciently quenched. In the limit of pure Ar, not reported in the ﬁgure, the
chamber was completely ineﬃcient, because of long after-pulses. Isobutane
fractions larger than 4% enabled stable RPC operation, although with an in-
eﬃciency somewhat larger than expected from geometrical considerations. The
best performance was observed with a 95/5 mixture, showing a plateau eﬃ-
ciency of about 80% for a supplied high voltage of about 6.5 kV. The eﬃciency
loss may be due to several reasons that require further investigation. The ex-
tension of the ineﬃcient area around the honeycomb has to be investigated
in detail: the ﬁeld quality there might be such that the eﬃciency loss region
is wider than the aramid structure itself. Another source of ineﬃciency may

be related to the low rate capability of the glass electrodes and the relatively
high count rate of spontaneous streamers observed.

The single count rate as a function of the bias supply was also measured (see
Fig. 2). We observed a fast rise of the single rate with no evidence of any
plateau. This is an indication that the single count rate was dominated by
spontaneous (spurious) streamers and not by physics events. At the voltage
supply corresponding to the beginning of the eﬃciency plateau, a single count
rate of about 0.2 Hz/cm2 was observed. This was four to ﬁve times larger
than the single count rate observed with standard glass chambers without the
the honeycomb insert and operated with a standard Ar/isobutane/HFC-134a
mixture 30/8/62 [16].

The dark current of the detector showed the same HV dependence of the single
count rate. The contribution to the current due to leakage in the honeycomb
structure is small, as the whole current observed could be accounted for by
the single count rate and the observed charge in the pulses.

3.2 Pulse shape and charge

Clean single pulses were observed in the test RPCs with honeycomb inserts
(see Fig. 3), with high pulse heights of typically 300 mV on the 25 Ω load
resistance. The fraction of the signals with multi-pulse is observed trough an
oscilloscope to be less than 10% for isobutane fractions larger than 4%. This

is at full variance with the behaviour of a standard (no honeycomb) RPC
operated under the same conditions (see Fig. 3), where multiple pulses were in
general observed. This testiﬁes of the eﬀectiveness of the honeycomb structure
in keeping the streamer localised within one single cell and in realising the
streamer quenching. On the other hand, the absence of a ﬂuorocarbon gas
made the quenching ineﬃcient in the standard chamber.

These qualitative indications are conﬁrmed by the results shown in Fig. 4,
where the charge distributions observed in the honeycomb RPC prototypes
and in the standard RPC detector, both operated at the plateau HV with a
Ar/isobutane 95/5 gas mixture, are compared. The charge distribution for the
honeycomb RPC shows a major ﬁrst peak with a small tail of large pulses.
A probability of multi-pulse signals of about 7% can be estimated from the
total area of the spectrum above the pedestal and the area of a Gaussian
distribution of about 700 pC mean charge and 140 pC RMS describing the
single pulse peak. The standard RPC, on the contrary, shows an indication of
the single pulse peak at around 500 pC and a long tail up to very high signal
charges corresponding to multi-pulse events. The multi-pulse probability is
about 70% with almost half of the pulses saturating the ADC upper edge at
2.2 nC. Due to the ineﬃciency of the quenching process, the standard RPC
also showed a detection eﬃciency lower than the honeycomb RPC.

The HV dependence of the charge distribution measured showed almost the
same shape for the honeycomb structure, with only a small increase in the
multi-pulse probability at the higher voltages. The peak charge induced on
the readout pad versus the high voltage for each gas mixture is shown in Fig.
5. The charge exhibits an approximately linear dependence on the operating
HV, distinctive of space charge dominated avalanche growth. The induced
charge is only mildly dependent on the isobutane fraction, but always rather
large as compared to a typical charge of about 100 pC of the streamer mode

operation with freon gas. This is explained qualitatively by the fact that the
absence of a gas with high electron aﬃnity such as freon leads to a higher gas
gain.

The streamer charge is expected to increase with the cell dimensions. A prelim-
inary indication of this eﬀect was obtained with a test RPC detector assembled
with a honeycomb sheet modiﬁed to obtain larger elementary cells. The charge
dependence on the cell size needs to be further investigated and systematic

A preliminary measurement of the time resolution of the test RPCs can be
seen in Fig. 6, where the distribution of the time diﬀerence between two cham-
bers, operated at 6.5 kV with an Ar/isobutane 95/5 gas mixture, is plotted.
Assuming that the resolution of the two chambers was identical, a RMS of
about 7.5 ns for each chamber could be estimated. Part of the large RMS can
be ascribed to the non-Gaussian tails of the distribution. If a Gaussian ﬁt to
the core of the distribution is performed, a resolution of 5 ns is obtained. This
resolution only slightly improved at higher voltages.

4 Summary and outlook

A few prototypes of “Mechanically Quenched” glass RPCs were built and
tested. In these detectors, the quenching and transverse conﬁnement of the
streamer was obtained by means of a honeycomb structure inserted between
the two resistive electrodes. We have shown that this detector design allowed
stable operation in streamer mode with Ar/isobutane non-ﬂammable gas mix-
tures. The optimal performance was achieved for isobutane fractions around
5%. This represents a new and promising approach to operate RPC detectors
with gas mixtures not containing freon, which is recognised as the main source
of RPC instability in the long term.

The preliminary results reported in this paper are encouraging, although the
chambers did show a somewhat larger ineﬃciency than expected from geo-
metrical considerations and the typical single count rate (0.2 Hz/cm2) was
about four times larger than in glass RPCs with standard Ar/isobutane/freon
mixtures. Being essentially a new technology, many aspects require further in-
vestigation. In particular, the optimisation of the honeycomb geometry, which
aﬀects the detector eﬃciency and the streamer charge, and of the electrode
material, which aﬀects the rate capability and thus the eﬃciency of a detector
with a relatively high rate of spontaneous streamers, has to be addressed. In
this prospect, RPC prototypes with diﬀerent cell dimensions and with bake-
lite electrodes are being produced. If high eﬃciencies can be demonstrated, a
careful study of the mechanical design and of the long term behaviour of these
chambers will also be deemed mandatory.

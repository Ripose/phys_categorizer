Abstract

The Silicon Drift Detectors will equip two of the six cylindrical layers of high precision position sensitive detectors
in the ITS of the ALICE experiment at LHC. In this paper we report the beam test results of a SDD irradiated
with 1 GeV electrons. The aim of this test was to verify the radiation tolerance of the device under an electron
ﬂuence equivalent to twice particle ﬂuence expected during 10 years of ALICE operation.

1. Introduction

The Inner Tracking System (ITS) is the cen-
tral detector of ALICE [1,2]. Its basic functions
are the secondary vertex reconstruction of hyperon
and charm decays, the particle identiﬁcation, the
tracking of low-momentum particles and the im-
provement of the momentum resolution. The Sili-
con Drift Detectors (SDDs) will equip the third and
the fourth layers of the ITS. They are very high-
resolution non ambiguous two dimensional readout
sensors adapted to high track density experiments
with low rate because of their relatively slow read-

out. Moreover, the operational mode allows a rad-
ical reduction in the number of readout channels.
The ALICE SDDs have to provide a spatial preci-
sion of about 30 µm for both coordinates. Perfor-
mance of diﬀerent SDD prototypes has been stud-
ied with particle beams since 1997 [3,4,5]. In this
paper we present the results obtained for detector
irradiated by 1GeV electron beam.

duced by Canberra Semiconductors on 300 µm

thick 5” thick NTD wafers with a resistivity of
3 kΩ·cm. Their active area is 7.02 × 7.53 cm2,
i.e.83% of total area. The active area is split
into two adjacent 35 mm long drift regions, each
equipped with 256 collecting anodes (294 µm
pitch), with built-in voltage dividers for the drift
and the guard regions. Design of the cathode
strips prevents any punch-through which would
deteriorate the voltage divider linearity. Due to
the strong temperature variation of detector’s
drift velocity(v ∝ T −2.4), the monitoring of this
quantity is performed by means of three rows of
33 implanted point-like MOS charge injectors for
each drift region [7,8]. During SDD operation the
hole component of the leakage current is collected
by the drift cathodes and enters the integrated
divider. This aﬀects the linearity of the poten-
tial distribution on the cathodes themselves and,
therefore, the position measurement obtained
from the drift time. Thus it is critical to monitor
such changes in order to be able to reconstruct
potential on the detector at any given time of
the experiment . This is the purpose of the MOS
injectors. The SDD front-end electronics is based
on two 64 channel ASICs named PASCAL[9] and
AMBRA[10]. Four pairs of chips per hybrid are
needed to read out one half of the SDD. Full de-
scription of the electronics is given in the paper
[11].

Important steps toward the mass production
of the detectors is evaluation of their radiation
hardness. For this study the SDD was irradiated
using 1 GeV electron beam at the LINAC of the
Synchrotron in Trieste. To reproduce the ALICE
radiation environment, the electron ﬂuence must
be 10 times the pion ﬂuence and 20 times the neu-
tron ﬂuence according to the Non-Ionizing Energy
Loss (NIEL) hypothesis [12]. For this study the
electron ﬂuence accumulated by the SDD is equiv-
alent to the total particle ﬂuence expected during
20 years of the ALICE operation and corresponds
to an absorbed dose in silicon of about 500 krad.

The laboratory measurements [13] of the an-
ode current and the voltage distribution on the
integrated divider as well as and the operation of
the MOS injectors demonstrate that the SDD is
suﬃciently radiation resistant for the full oper-
ation lifetime of the ALICE experiment. Still, it

was necessary to verify these expectations with a
beam test. Within 2002 and 2003 years, the same
detector was tested twice (before and after its irra-
diation with electrons) using CERN SPS π− beam
with p = 100 GeV/c. The detector under test was
placed on the beam line. A telescope, made up of
ﬁve pairs of single sided silicon strip detectors with
a strip pitch of 50 µm, was used to reconstruct
the tracks of passing particles. Precision in the
determination of the particle impact point in the
SDD plane was 5 µm. Since the size of the beam
spot and the area covered by the microstrip detec-
tors were smaller than the SDD sensitive area, the
SDD was mounted on a mobile support. Its posi-
tion was remotely controlled and measured with
a precision of about 30 µm. It should be noted
that during June 2002 beam test only the central
anode region of the SDD was studied, and in this
case 32-channel PASCAL prototype was used. To
study the irradiated SDD in August 2003 we used
64-channel PASCAL to readout full anode array.

3. Beam test results

3.1. Cluster Size

The electron cloud generated by an ionizing par-
ticle in the SDD undergoes a diﬀusion while drift-
ing to the collection anodes. After the digitization
of the anode signals, the cloud is represented by
a two-dimensional set of amplitude values, called
a ”cluster”. We compared cluster size in the non-
irradiated and irradiated detector. Fig. 1 shows the
relative amounts of clusters collected by one, two
and three anodes as a function of the drift time. At
a short drift distance the number of multi-anode
clusters increases after irradiation due to increased
diﬀusion coeﬃcient. For a large drift distance a
presence of one-anode clusters can be observed for
irradiated detector because of a threshold cut and
decrease of the signal amplitude.

3.2. Charge

the SDD before and after irradiation. The collected

particular wafer during detector fabrication. After
irradiation a rapidity of charge loss increases by
three times due to the increased electron trapping.
The comparison of the most probable values of the
registered charge shows that after irradiation the
charge collection drops by 60% at the maximum
drift distance.

3.3. Dopant inhomogeneity

Even though the ALICE SDDs are produced
on NTD wafers, which should have a particularly
uniform dopant concentration, the observed inho-
mogeneity characteristic eﬀects deteriorate signiﬁ-
cantly the spatial resolution of the detectors [14,5].
Inhomogeneity of the dopant concentration alters
the uniformity of the main drift ﬁeld and, thus,
creates systematic deviations in the measurement
of coordinates of the registered particle.

lected by one, two or three anodes as a function of the drift

and of the drift (bottom) coordinates as a function of the

A charge collection ineﬃciency before irradia-
tion was already observed in this detector on the
test bench in the laboratory. The most probable
reason is the presence of electron trapping centers
in the silicon bulk, occasionally introduced in that

The diﬀerences between coordinates of a par-
ticle impact point measured by the SDD and by
the microstrip telescope (residuals) are presented
in Fig.3 for the irradiated SDD. They are plot-
ted as functions of the anode coordinate and the

3

drift distance. The grey scale represents magni-
tude of residuals for the anode coordinate (top
plot) and the drift coordinate (bottom plot). The
empty areas correspond to non-working channels
or missing experimental data. Deviation of a few
tens of µm in average and with maximum values
up to 200 µm are observed and must be corrected
to reach the required spatial resolution of 30 µm.
Recently custom ingots have shown much lower
doping ﬂuctuation. The circular structures cen-
tered in the middle of the wafer clearly visible in
this plot can be attributed to the characteristic
radial dependence of the dopant concentration
ﬂuctuations [5,14,15].

Fig. 4. Simulated maps of the systematic deviations before
(top) and after (bottom) irradiation.

In addition to radial structures, the maps
present also a deviation pattern in a form of verti-
cal lines. Since the eﬀect is similar for all electrons
collected by a certain anode and looks correlated
with the intersection of the circular structure by
the anode line, we can conclude that the local ﬁeld
and its ﬂuctuations in the collection region is at
the origin of this eﬀect. We can also clearly observe
that, after irradiation, the magnitude of this lin-
ear pattern has increased. In order to understand
whether this evolution of the position correction
map is easily predictable, a charge transport simu-
lation was performed (Fig.4), taking into account
a realistic three-dimensional electrostatic ﬁeld
model in the detector. This ﬁeld was generated
by superimposing a potential ﬂuctuation map to
the solution of the Poisson equation assuming
a homogeneous silicon bulk. To reproduce qual-

4

itatively the experimental ﬂuctuation map, the
superposition of four radial waves with diﬀerent
wavelengths was used. After irradiation, the diﬀer-
ence of potential between adjacent cathodes is not
anymore constant but assumes a linear evolution,
responsible for a linear dependence of the electro-
static drift ﬁeld as a function of the drift distance.
The drift ﬁeld is weaker close to the anodes and
stronger for the maximum drift distance. In order
to optionally reproduce this eﬀect, a parabolic
component can be added to the potential in the
simulation. The transport calculation of the elec-
trons in the silicon bulk takes into account the
electrostatic ﬁeld deriving from the previously de-
scribed potential. The trajectory of the electrons
was calculated from every node of a grid covering
the half SDD surface, to the collection anodes.
Assuming a linear trajectory and a constant drift
velocity, the initial position of the electron can be
estimated from its arrival time and anode axis co-
ordinate. The two coordinates of the diﬀerence of
the predicted and the actual positions as a func-
tion of the initial position are plotted in Fig.4.
Two cases are shown: before and after irradiation.
The vertical deviation pattern can eﬀectively be
observed and its magnitude increased when the
parabolic potential is added. As a conclusion, we
can say that the irradiation has only an indirect
eﬀect on the deviation map through its inﬂuence
on the voltage divider but no signiﬁcant eﬀect on
the bulk material properties.

3.4. Spatial resolution

The detector spatial resolution is deﬁned as the
r.m.s. of the diﬀerence between the position mea-
sured by the SDD and the impact point coordinate
reconstructed with the microstrip telescope. Fig.5
shows the resolution along the anode and the drift
time directions obtained after correction of the sys-
tematic deviation for one half of the irradiated
SDD. The resolution along the anode direction has
values better than 30 µm over more than 70% of the
whole drift path and the best value reachs 15 µm
at 3 mm from the anodes. The deterioration of the
resolution at a small drift distance is due to the a
small size of the electron cloud collected on the an-

odes. The resolution along the drift direction has
a value increasing from 30 µm to 48 µm.

Even with the very strong eﬀect of the dopant in-
homogeneity which increases with irradiation, it
is demonstrated that the systematic deviations in
coordinate measurements can be corrected and a
satisfactory resolution can be achieved along both
anodic and drift directions.

4. Conclusion

Extensive study of the performance of a silicon
drift detector irradiated with dose equivalent to 20
years of the ALICE operation was carried out using
a 64-channel PASCAL front-end chip. The results
show than in spite of increased charge loss the val-
ues of the spatial resolution fully satisfy the ALICE
technical design requirements, once the correction
of the systematic errors is performed. The detec-
tor was found to be suﬃciently radiation hard for
the ALICE experiment.

narrow central anode region for non-irradiated and irradi-
ated SDD.

References

For narrow central region of the SDD anodes it
is possible to compare the spatial resolution be-
fore and after irradiation (Fig. 6). One can observe
that after irradiation in the vicinity of the anodes,
the value of the resolution along both direction be-
comes better. This behaviour is due to decreasing
fraction of the narrow clusters after irradiation. For
longer drift distances, the values of the resolution
are very similar to those for non-irradiated detec-
tor. Taking into account that the SDD was irradi-
ated with dose equivalent to 20 years of the AL-
ICE operation, the resolution remains within spec-
iﬁcations of technical design for the ALICE ITS.

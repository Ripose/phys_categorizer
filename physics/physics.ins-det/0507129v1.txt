Track ﬁtting in slightly inhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁelds

Abstract

A ﬁtting method to reconstruct the momentum and direction of charged particles
in slightly inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds is presented in detail. For magnetic ﬁelds
of the order of 1 T and inhomogeneity gradients as large as 1 T/m the typical
momentum bias due to the proposed approximations is of the order of few MeV,
to be compared with scattering components of the order of 20 MeV or even larger.
This method is currently being employed in the reconstruction programs of the
AMS experiment.

1 Introduction

The next generation of particle physics experiments will be characterized by
an unprecedented accuracy in the determination of the positions and momenta
of very energetic charged particles. The principle of momentum measurement
is, in all cases, the linear relation between the track curvature and the inverse
of the momentum in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld direction.
High energy physics experiments have successfully employed this principle for
many decades, producing many relevant physics results and discoveries.

Track ﬁtting in inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds involves the propagation of
track parameters between consecutive detector layers. Typical approaches [1,2],
use numerical methods of high order in order to integrate the equations of mo-
tion from layer to layer. This report describes a simple alternative algorithm,
currently being employed in the AMS experiment [3]. All propagation opera-
tions are expressed in terms of path integrals, which are approximated with
enough accuracy at initialization. The ﬁtting step is also reduced to a linear

problem. The simplicity of the algorithm allows fast reﬁtting of tracks, even
beyond the reconstruction phase, i.e. at the level of ﬁnal physics analyses.

The report is organized as follows. The approximations that are the basis of the
method and few formulae to estimate its accuracy are presented in section 2.
The track ﬁtting logic and a typical implementation are described in section 3.
Section 4 discusses the inclusion of multiple scattering eﬀects. The report is
summarized in section 5.

2 Basis of the method

The trajectory of a particle with charge q in a static magnetic ﬁeld ~B is
governed by the equation:

~v
≡ k

where ~p and ~v are the momentum and velocity of the particle at a given
position ~x and time t on the trajectory. An immediate conclusion is that
v
~p
and p
are constants of motion. Locally, the trajectory is a
k
~B
helix, with p sin θB = q
R, where R is the (signed) radius of curvature in a
k
plane transverse to ~B and θB the angle between ~v and ~B. Equation 1 can be
rewritten in a diﬀerent way:

where dl

ally, ~u is a unitary vector tangent to the trajectory at the point ~x. Integration

by the subscripts 0 and 1, leads to:

that is, computing the integral along the straight line connecting ~x0 and ~x1.
The approximation is exact in two cases: a) when the magnetic ﬁeld is homo-
geneous, and b) in the inﬁnite momentum limit. For the homogeneous ﬁeld
case, ~B(l)

very high momentum, case b), ~u = ~x1−~x0
k~x1−~x0k up to relative corrections of order
1/p, leading trivially again to Equation 4.

In order to estimate the accuracy of the approximation in a general case, two
additional expressions are necessary. First, the expression of the magnetic ﬁeld
as a series expansion around l1/2 ≡

(l0 + l1)/2:

where ∆B is the typical variation of the magnetic ﬁeld between l0 and l1. For
instance, inhomogeneities in the magnetic ﬁeld of the order of 1 T/m imply
uncertainties of order ∆p
1.6 MeV, independent of the absolute value of
the rigidity. This has to be compared with the typical contributions from mul-
tiple scattering in silicon detectors. For AMS-02 [3], optimized in this respect,
the expected momentum resolution at the lowest momenta suggests multiple
scattering eﬀects of order ∆p & 20 MeV [3], safely beyond the accuracy of the
approximation.

The previous expression, which is linear in ~x0, ~u0 and q/p, does not coincide
in general with the exact solution for the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld case.
Nevertheless, we will prove that it is precise enough for most cases of interest.
Let us deﬁne a convenient orthonormal reference system by the unitary vectors
~uA, ~uB and ~uC:

For a benchmark separation of 20 cm and a magnetic ﬁeld of 1 T, we obtain
a maximum possible shift of ∆p
5 MeV. In practice, the eﬀect is even
smaller, since the missing correction aﬀects coordinates in directions less sen-
sitive to bending (~u0 and ~uA). For most experiments, the ﬁtting procedure
is based on the minimization of a function in which position measurements
in bending and non-bending directions are almost decoupled. In this conﬁg-
uration, the correction above will act in quadrature, eﬀectively leading to a
momentum shift of order:

The quoted shift is negligible, even for large magnetic ﬁelds, like those of
LHC and future linear collider detectors. In fact, this conclusion is somehow
equivalent to the one reached in Reference [4] in the context of homogeneous
magnetic ﬁelds. There, only measurements along the direction of the impact
parameter with respect to the track at each point (i.e. the sensitive “bending”
direction) are considered. This assumption leads naturally to a linear problem
in terms of the curvature parameter [4].

3 Track ﬁtting

For simplicity, it is assumed that all tracker sensitive layers are parallel to the
z direction and that uncorrelated position measurements are performed along
the x and y directions. The extension to more elaborated geometrical conﬁg-
urations is straightforward, since only simple rotations of the predictions are
involved. An obvious example is that of a detector with a radial conﬁguration.
To deal with it, it is enough to substitute one of the χ2 terms in the expressions
presented later by a sum of residues along the azimuthal direction.

We consider a scenario in which z coordinates are known with inﬁnite pre-
cision, so they can be ﬁxed to their nominal values. The inclusion of an ad-

6

ditional z-term is, nevertheless, a trivial extension to the proposed scheme.
Multiple scattering eﬀects will be discussed in the next section.

We need to determine the position of the track at the ﬁrst plane, ~x0 ≡
(u0x, u0y, u0z), and the
(x0, y0, z0), the tangent vector at the ﬁrst plane, ~u0 ≡
inverse of the rigidity, q/p. From Equation 25 we obtain, on the second plane:

4 Multiple scattering treatment

It will be assumed that the amount of traversed material is reasonably small
and that the momentum range of interest is such that energy losses can be
safely neglected. In these conditions, multiple scattering between layers j
1
and j is taken into account by estimating the additional uncertainty induced
on the director vector uj. This uncertainty depends on: a) the amount of
traversed material in radiation lengths, b) the particle momentum and c) its
velocity.

−

−

From layer j
1 to layer j a particle is traversing the amount of material Xj,j−1,
measured in radiation lengths. The rms angular deviations in the xz and yz
projections are equal. Denoting them by by ∆j,j−1, they can be approximately
parametrized [5,6] as follows:

∆j,j−1 =

0.0136
β

q
p[GeV]

q

Xj,j−1 [1 + 0.038 ln(Xj,j−1)]

(37)

where β is the velocity of the particle (in c units) and p its momentum ex-
pressed in GeV. Note also that the Xj,j−1 thicknesses hide a dependence on the
director vectors ~uj. The previous expression, accurate at the few percent level
in the range 0.003 . Xj,j−1 . 0.01 [6], does not admit a Gaussian treatment,
in the sense that the expected additive property as a function of the amount
of material is not satisﬁed: ∆2(X + Y )

= ∆2(X) + ∆2(Y ).

It is convenient to work with Gaussian uncertainties in order to keep a χ2
minimization scheme. In the case of a very small amount of traversed material
a possible approach is to assume the previous formula to be correct for the total
amount of traversed material and then distribute the remaining deviations in a
linear way at any intermediate plane, i.e. such that the rms deviation is always
proportional to √X. If the total amount of material is Xtot, the suggestion
implies:

∆j,j−1 ≃

0.0136 [1 + 0.038 ln(Xtot)]
β

q
p[GeV]

Xj,j−1

(38)

The previous estimate is usually consistent with the quoted accuracy of Equa-
tion [6]. For the AMS-02 silicon tracker, it overestimates the rms deviations
at the intermediate planes by at most 4%.

From the ﬁtting point of view, multiple scattering just modiﬁes the directions
at the diﬀerent layers as follows:

~uj = ~uj(NO MS) +

~ǫk,k−1

(39)

j

Xk=1

where ~uj(NO MS) denotes the calculation in the absence of multiple scatter-
ing and ~ǫj,j−1 is a deviation that follows a Gaussian of mean zero and width
(∆j,j−1, ∆j,j−1, 0). The j dependence enters through the amount of accumu-
≈
lated radiation lengths Xj,j−1 between the exit of layer j
1 and the exit of
layer j. At the level of position measurements the modiﬁed trajectories read:

−

~xj = ~xj(NO MS) +

There are two possible options to include these additional sources of un-
certainty in the χ2. The ﬁrst one is to ﬁt all these additional parameters
(2(number of planes
2)) with additional Gaussian constraints according to
the expected widths. We will employ a second option, keeping the same num-
ber of ﬁtted parameters, but building new covariance matrices according to
the Gaussian uncertainties ∆k,k−1. In the absence of multiple scattering, the
covariance matrices for the x and y projections , V 0

Even if the χ2 to be minimized seems formally linear in the parameters ~p,
multiple scattering introduces a dependence on q/p and ~u0 via the covariance
matrices V and W . A convenient way to solve the problem is to minimize
the χ2 following an iterative procedure. In a ﬁrst step, the χ2 is minimized
using the diagonal covariance matrices V 0
ij. The minimization is then
iterated several times, using the Vij and Wij matrices determined from the
parameters of the previous step. The iterative procedure is rapidly convergent.
It may be stopped either after a couple of iterations or when some convergence
criteria are reached. If computing time is not an issue, a convenient choice is
to stop when the diﬀerence in rigidity between two consecutive steps is smaller
than the accuracy of the method (a few MeV).

5 Summary

We have presented a simple algorithm for track ﬁtting of high energy particles
traversing slightly inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds. The method is based on the

11

prior calculation of a few path integrals which depend just on the measured
positions and a few values of the magnetic ﬁeld. The minimization of a χ2,
which presents a linear dependence on the track parameters, leads to a simple
solution of the problem. Multiple scattering is considered in a straightforward
and user-controlled way. This is particularly important when potential detec-
tor resolution problems have to be disentangled from trivial material budget
eﬀects. Compared to other methods, a few simple formulae (9, 22 and 23) allow
for a fast estimate of the expected momentum uncertainties. These formulae
use as inputs the average value of the magnetic ﬁeld, the typical size of the
ﬁeld inhomogeneities and the distance between measuring layers. The uncer-
tainties translate into a shift of the measured momentum which, for most cases
of interest in present and future high energy experiments, are of the order of a
few MeV, well below the uncertainties due to multiple scattering. The method
discussed here is being employed in the context of the AMS experiment [3].
Thanks to its intrinsic simplicity, it is also being used for fast and reliable
track ﬁtting at the latest steps of data reconstruction and analysis.

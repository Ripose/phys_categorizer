ABSTRACT: A new concept is presented for the reduction of ion back-ﬂow in GEM-based cascaded
gaseous electron multipliers, by incorporating Micro-Hole & Strip Plate (MHSP) elements operat-
ing in reversed-bias mode (R-MHSP). About an order of magnitude reduction in ion back-ﬂow is
achieved by diverting back-drifting ions from their original path. A R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP cas-
caded multiplier operated at total gain of ∼1.5*105 yielded ion back-ﬂow fractions of 1.5*10−3
and 4*10−4, at drift ﬁelds of 0.5 and 0.1 kV/cm, respectively. A 2R-MHSP/MHSP cascaded multi-
plier operated at a total gain of ∼105, yielded an ion back-ﬂow fraction of 3*10−3. We discuss the
concept for trapping back-ﬂowing ions in these cascaded multipliers and the relevance to gaseous
photomultiplier and TPC applications; directions for further future developments are outlined.

1. Introduction.

During the avalanche process in gaseous detectors, a large number of ions and photons are pro-
duced. In gaseous photomultipliers (GPM), their impact on the photocathode (PC) has high proba-
bility to induce secondary electron emission (SEE) and to generate secondary avalanches, known as
ion- and photon-feedback. The secondary avalanches cause signiﬁcant gain limitations and distor-
tions of the spatial and temporal information. The photon feedback may be signiﬁcantly suppressed
by a proper choice of the electron-multiplier geometrical design and its operation conditions, and it
is practically fully suppressed in cascaded GEM multiplier conﬁgurations [1, 2]. The ion backﬂow
is much more difﬁcult to suppress without affecting the multiplier gain and detection efﬁciency,
because the ions’ and electrons’ paths are not decoupled. The ion backﬂow to the PC strongly
limits the multiplier’s gain; e.g. gains <100 were measured in GEM-based visible-light sensitive
GPMs due to the high emission properties of bialkali photocathodes, while they could attain 106
values when blocking the ions with a pulsed ion-gate electrode [3]. The back-ﬂowing ions have
further severe consequences, of physical and chemical damage to the PC surface and accelerated
degradation of its quantum efﬁciency (QE) [3, 4, 5]. The ion backﬂow is also of great concern in
Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), where the ion-cloud penetration into the drift volume builds up
space-charge and causes rate-dependent dynamic electric-ﬁeld distortions, consequently affecting
the TPC resolution. Intensive research has been carried out to reduce this effect by replacing the
standard wire-chamber TPC readout elements by cascaded GEM or Micromegas multipliers [6].

Though the demand to reduce ion backﬂow is common to TPCs and to GPMs, they differ in
their operation conditions; TPCs typically operate at relatively low gain (∼104) and with low drift
ﬁeld above the multiplier (∼0.1-0.2 kV/cm) while GPMs have to operate at higher gain (>105),

– 1 –

to ensure single-photoelectron sensitivity, and with higher drift ﬁelds (≥0.5kV/cm), to provide
efﬁcient photoelectron extraction from the PC [7]. It should be noted that a 5-fold difference in
drift ﬁeld values generally implies a corresponding 5-fold higher ion backﬂow [8, 9]; the demands
for ten-times higher gain and for full single photoelectron detection efﬁciency in GPMs imply
further constrains in this case, as will be seen below.

The fraction of the last-avalanche induced ions ﬂowing back to the drift volume or to the PC is
deﬁned here as Ion Backﬂow Fraction (IBF). The total number of electrons (and ions) created in the
last avalanche in the cascade, per single initial electron (e.g. a photoelectron or a single ionization
electron), is deﬁned as the total gain of the multiplier. The number of electrons, per single initial
electron, transferred from a given multiplier element on to a consecutive electrode is deﬁned as the
visible gain of that element.

In a single multi-wire or parallel-plate electron multiplier all the avalanche ions ﬂow back to
the cathodes, thus IBF=1. In cascaded-GEM structures some ions are trapped on GEM surfaces due
to the dipole ﬁeld within the GEM holes. It was shown [8] that the IBF in multi-GEM structures
does not depend on the gas ﬁlling but rather on the detector’s geometry and on the electric ﬁelds
conﬁguration. The charge ﬂow of both ions and electrons is reduced when choosing smaller GEM
holes and smaller transfer ﬁelds between successive elements [8].In cascades comprising 3-4 GEM
electrodes, it is possible to reduce the IBF by optimizing the hole diameter and shape as well as
the transfer ﬁelds between the elements. The lowest IBF values reported so far, at total gas gain
∼104, are of the order of 0.05 and 0.01 at respective drift ﬁelds of 0.5 and 0.1kV/cm [8, 9].The
lowest ones at higher gains, of ∼105, are ∼0.025 and 0.05 for 3 and 4 GEM-multiplier detectors
correspondingly, at a drift ﬁeld of 0.1kV/cm [10]. An operation of a 4-GEM detector with reﬂective
PC on the top most electrode provided an IBF value of ∼0.1 at a gain of 105-106 [11]. It was
recently reported [12, 13, 14] that a 3-GEM TPC readout element could be optimized as to have
IBF=0.005 at a drift ﬁeld of 0.2 kV/cm, by operating it in a highly asymmetric biasing mode:
very high (∼8kV/cm) ﬁrst and third transfer ﬁelds, very low (∼60V/cm) second transfer ﬁeld and
high bias voltage (∼350V) on the third GEM. This conﬁguration was optimized for a total gain
of 104 and it may not be adequate for higher gains, because some of the ﬁelds are already at their
maximum possible value.

The IBF values presently reached in GPMs (with high total gain and high drift ﬁeld [8, 10,
11]), of >10−2, are not sufﬁcient for their DC operation with visible-light sensitive PCs; for such
operation, considering the SEE probability of bialkali PCs, IBF<10−4 is required. Furthermore,
TPCs designed for future particle- and nuclear-physics collider experiments will operate at high
drift ﬁelds (0.5-1 kV/cm) and will also require electron multipliers with IBF∼10−4, It is therefore
clear that the current goal is an IBF∼10−4 and better for both GPMs and TPCs modes: in TPCs
it will practically eliminate all ions in the drift region and in single-photon GPMs, operating at
total gains of 105-106, it will reduce photocathode aging and ion-induced secondary avalanches to
acceptable levels [15, 16]. As long as the IBF is not reduced to these levels, it constitutes a true
obstacle in the further development of visible-light sensitive GPMs and calls for a thorough search
for novel viable solutions for substantial IBF reduction.

An effective IBF suppression was already conﬁrmed in TPCs [17] as well as in multi-GEM
based photon detectors [3, 11], by means of an ion-gate electrode, which indeed suppresses the
IBF to better than 10−4. However, ion gating often requires an external trigger source and involves

– 2 –

electronic noise problems; it induces dead-time and thus rate-limitations, restricting its range of
applications. We are therefore searching for ways to reduce the IBF in gaseous electron multipliers
in DC mode.

An attempt to do this by modifying the ﬁeld conﬁguration and thereby diverting a fraction of
the ions away from the PC in a gaseous photomultiplier was done by replacing the last GEM in
the cascade with a Micro-Hole & Strip Plate (MHSP) multiplier [18].The MHSP, like the GEM,
is a hole-multiplier (Fig. 1); in addition it has narrow anode strips patterned on the bottom side,
which under positive-voltage biasing provide a second avalanche multiplication, further to the one
occurring within the electrode’s holes. The electric ﬁeld established between the anode strips, the
cathode strips and the additional cathode plane (Fig. 2a) prevents a large fraction ( 80%) of the
ﬁnal-avalanche ions from back ﬂowing through the hole, as shown in [19]. Moreover, the two-
stage multiplication of the MHSP enables further transfer-ﬁeld optimization: by setting a small
transfer ﬁeld above the MHSP, the ﬂow of both ions and electrons between the GEMs and the
MHSP is reduced, but the loss in gain is recovered by the additional strip multiplication. Using
such a scheme in a gaseous photomultiplier comprising 3-GEMs, a reﬂective CsI PC evaporated on
the top GEM and an MHSP, the IBF was measured to be ∼0.03 at a total gain of 105 [19, 20]. This
clearly demonstrated the potential for IBF reduction when using the MHSP electrode, by creating
different paths for electrons and ions.

Following this line, it was further proposed [21] to reverse the roles of the MHSP′s anode
and cathode strips, in an attempt to trap ions originating from consecutive multiplication elements
in the cascade, preventing them to ﬂow through the holes. Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b show the ﬁeld
conﬁguration in the immediate proximity of the MHSP hole, for these two different modes of
MHSP operation, deﬁned here as the normal (MHSP) and the reversed (R-MHSP) modes (the
arrows point at the ﬁeld direction, namely to the ion drift direction). Note that in the normal MHSP
mode, the narrow strip-electrodes act as anodes; they are biased more positive than the broader
(cathode) strips surrounding the holes; in this case double-stage multiplication takes place within
the holes and at the anode strips (Fig. 2a). In the reversed R-MHSP mode, the narrow strips are
biased more negative than the broader ones; charge multiplication occurs only within the holes
while the more-negative narrow cathode-strips only collect a fraction of the ions (Fig. 2b). The
operation mode of the MHSP permits its use either as a stand-alone detector [18, 22] or as the last
element in a cascaded multiplier [19]. On the other hand, the R-MHSP, with its hole-multiplication,
can be used anywhere in the cascade, and especially as a ﬁrst element, trapping back-ﬂowing ions
from all successive elements (as shown below).

However, one should be aware that in order to have full detection efﬁciency of single photo-
electrons emitted from the photocathode, or of ionization electrons radiation-induced within the
drift volume, two conditions have to be fulﬁlled: 1) the electron’s collection efﬁciency into the
R-MHSP holes, particularly in the application to single-photon GPMs, has to be close to unity;
this was indeed conﬁrmed for GEMs [9, 23] but not yet for MHSPs, which have slightly more
"opaque" hole geometry (Fig. 1); 2) the visible gain of the ﬁrst element in the cascade should
be large enough to ensure full event’s detection efﬁciency, including in the case of exponential
pulse-height distribution of single photoelectrons; this condition implies a visible gain of at least
20. The two conditions are of prime importance, because an electron lost at the ﬁrst multiplication
element due to inefﬁcient focusing, insufﬁcient multiplication or inefﬁcient extraction cannot be
recovered. Indeed, it was found that the R-MHSP biasing scheme reduces the extraction efﬁciency
of the avalanche electrons from the holes towards the next element in the cascade, thus reducing
the visible gain of this multiplier [24].

A ﬁrst attempt to implement the above ideas, cascading two R-MHSPs with two GEMs [24]
resulted in an IBF value of 4*10−3, with a drift ﬁeld of 0.5kV/cm and a total gain of 104. This study
revealed, for the ﬁrst time, that the ion trapping also results in a considerable loss of electrons (i.e.
loss of visible gain) - necessitating a careful optimization of the operation conditions. In addition,
this particular experiment was carried out with a defective R-MHSP electrode, of a limited hole
multiplication; this resulted in a very low visible gain (only 6 electrons in average were transferred
into the next GEM multiplication stage), and did not permit raising the strip voltages to fully
exploit the possibility of ion trapping. Following the production of better quality MHSP electrodes
we continued to study this avenue of IBF reduction. We will describe below the results obtained
with different cascaded multiplier schemes combining GEM, MHSP and R-MHSP elements; the
optimization of the R-MHSP potentials permitted reaching higher gains in the ﬁrst multiplying
element, and resulting in low IBF values with good single-electron detection efﬁciencies [3].

2. Methodology.

Four multiplier conﬁgurations investigated within this work are shown in Fig. 3; they combine a
UV photocathode as a single-photoelectron source, a drift space with variable drift ﬁelds, electron
multipliers and a readout anode. Fig. 3a depicts a single R-MHSP element coupled to a readout
anode; It permitted investigating and understanding the role of the various potentials and to opti-
mize their values. Fig. 3b shows a R-MHSP followed by a GEM; the GEM avalanche was used
as an "ion generator" for studying the IBF suppression capability of the R-MHSP. The cascaded
R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP multiplier is shown in Fig. 3c; this conﬁguration permitted establishing
the IBF value of this cascaded multiplier operating at high total gains, and using various drift ﬁelds
corresponding to GPM and TPC operation conditions. In addition, a detector incorporating 2R-
MHSPs followed by an MHSP is shown in Fig. 3d; it represents a conﬁguration with a reﬂective
radiation converter, e.g. a UV-photocathode, deposited on the ﬁrst element in the cascaded GPM.
The MHSP and GEM electrodes, of 28x28 mm2 effective area, were produced at the CERN
printed circuit workshop, from 50m m thick Kapton foil with 5m m copper cladding on both sides.
The etched double-conical 70/50m m outer/inner diameter GEM holes are arranged in hexagonal
pattern of pitch 140m m. The MHSP pattern and dimensions are shown in Fig. 1. All electrodes
were stretched onto small MACOR frames. The semitransparent PC was 5mm in diameter; it was
made of 300Å thick layer of CsI, evaporated on a UV transparent window, pre-coated with a 40Å
thick Cr ﬁlm.

The detector elements were mounted within a stainless-steel vessel evacuated with a turbo-
molecular pump to ∼107 Torr prior to gas ﬁlling. The detector was operated with Ar/CH4 (95/5) at
760 Torr, under regulated gas ﬂow. The detector was irradiated with a continuous Ar(Hg) UV-lamp
through the window. Each of its electrodes was biased independently with a CAEN N471A or
CAEN N126 power supply.

In all multiplier cascade conﬁgurations, the currents on biased electrodes were recorded as
resistor with a Fluke 175 voltmeter of 10MW
a voltage-drop on a 33MW
internal impedance.
Their combined resistance was 7.69MW
from which the anode current was calculated. The ﬁ-
nal avalanche-induced currents following charge multiplication were always kept below 100 nA
by attenuating the UV-lamp photon ﬂux with absorbers, if necessary, to avoid charging-up effects.
The currents on grounded electrodes were recorded with a Keithley 485 picoamperemeter.

The IBF, visible gain and total gain were evaluated by recording currents from the various
electrodes in the cascade, as described below for each of the conﬁgurations investigated. In partic-
ular: 1) the total gain in the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP detector was calculated from the ratio of the
electron current IA on the anode of the last multiplying element (MHSP) to the PC photocurrent
IPC0, measured in photoelectron collection mode (no gain): Gtot = IA/IPC0. The total gain derived
from this currents ratio relates to the average multiplication factor; the number of electrons in an
avalanche (and therefore the number of ions that hit the PC) is distributed according to a Polya
function [26, 27, 28]. 2) The PC current recorded under multiplication conditions IPC, comprises
the photocurrent IPC0 and the ion backﬂow current - the latter is by far dominant. Therefore, in the
R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP detector the ratio of IPC to the MHSP anode current recorded under the
same conditions IA, provides the IBF= IPC/IA. The deﬁnitions are consistent with those of refer-
ences [19, 24]. 3) the visible gain of the ﬁrst R-MHSP element Fig. 3a is derived from the ratio

3. Results.

3.1 Study of a single R-MHSP.

While the MHSP operation properties are already well established [19], those of the more recent
R-MHSP [24] required some more basic study. The single R-MHSP study (Fig. 3a, Fig. 3b)
was designed to yield understanding of the various potentials′ role and conditions for minimal
IBF, minimal electron losses and maximal visible gain. The parameters affecting the R-MHSP′s
operation are: 1) the hole bias voltage (Vhole) which controls the multiplication and the IBF from

– 6 –

the ﬁrst element; 2) the anode-to-cathode strips voltage (VAC), which reduces the visible gain of
a single R-MHSP and reduces IBF from successive elements; 3) the transfer ﬁeld below the R-
MHSP (Eind in Fig. 3a or Etrans in Fig. 3b, Fig. 3c and Fig. 3d), which affects both the IBF from
successive elements and the visible gain of the R-MHSP.

D VAC=70V, dashed line: D VAC=0V.

For simplicity, and since its inﬂuence is similar to that in cascaded GEMs (i.e. a linear increase
of electron extraction efﬁciency with this ﬁeld [25]), we ﬁxed the ﬁeld under the R-MHSP to be
1kV/cm. The drift ﬁeld Edri f t was maintained at 0.5 kV/cm (i.e. typical GPM operation conditions),
which with Ar/CH4 (95/5) provides ∼70% efﬁciency to extract photoelectrons from the PC [7].At
other Edri f t values, the IBF increases linearly with the ﬁeld [8] and thus a ﬁve-fold smaller IBF
value is expected with Edri f t= 0.1 kV/cm (i.e. TPC operation conditions).The exact collection
efﬁciency (namely focusing into the holes) from the semitransparent PC into the R-MHSP holes,
as function of the drift and hole ﬁelds (Edri f t , Vhole), extensively investigated for GEM cascades
[23, 25] is a subject of another study, beyond the scope of the present article. An indication for
high collection efﬁciency arises from Fig. 2a, since there are no ﬁeld lines that start at the R-
MHSP top face, even though the ﬁgure corresponds to a cut made along the maximal hole distance.
Furthermore, this efﬁciency can be roughly estimated, by comparison to studies in GEMs: since
the holes of the R-MHSP are arranged in hexagonal pattern with maximal pitch of 210m m, it is
expected that the collection efﬁciency will be not worse than that of GEMs with identical hole
diameter and pitch of 200m m [25, 29], provided the same gas and the same Vhole and Edri f t are
used. The collection efﬁciency of a GEM, with a pitch of 200m m and hole diameter 80m m and
70m m, acting as the ﬁrst cascade element, were studied in conditions corresponding to operation
with semitransparent PC [29] and reﬂective PC [25]. It was found that in Ar/DME (90/10) with a
GEM-MWPC device preceded with a drift space, with hole voltage of 360V and drift ﬁelds in the
range of 0.1-1kV/cm, the collection efﬁciency was of 90-100% [29]; with a GEM coated with a
reﬂective PC, a collection efﬁciency of 90% was measured with hole voltage above 200V and drift
ﬁeld 0kV/cm in Ar/CH4 (95/5) [25]. Therefore, we may expect a collection efﬁciency 90% for our

R-MHSP, when operating with semitransparent PC (Edri f t =0.5kV/cm) at hole voltage >360V and
with reﬂective PC (Edri f t =0kV/cm) at hole voltage >200V.

Using MAXWELL 3D software package [30] we found for the R-MHSP (Fig. 4) that the ﬁeld
at the topside electrode, in the immediate proximity of the holes entrance, is not inﬂuenced by the
voltage difference applied to the strips at the bottom-side electrode. This means that the electron
transport and focusing into the R-MHSP holes is not affected by D VAC and should be studied only
as function of Edri f t and Vhole. As emphasized above, for efﬁcient single-photoelectron detection
the visible gain of the ﬁrst R-MHSP should be carefully monitored. Taking into account that when
D VAC is raised, only a few percents of the R-MHSP avalanche electrons are extracted to the next
element, and that single-electron multiplication is exponential, we estimated that the ﬁrst R-MHSP
element should have a visible gain >20 in order to detect photoelectrons with good efﬁciency; the

– 8 –

exact detection efﬁciency is a subject for future study, with pulse-counting method. Our current
estimation is based on the avalanche-size distribution in single electron multiplication, which in
general should follow Polya formula [26, 27, 28], but in the case of hole multiplication, in most
gases [2], simpliﬁes to an exponential distribution: P(q) = exp(−q/q), q and q are the number and
the mean of electrons in a single-electron induced avalanche. With q being the visible gain, GV IS,
of the R-MHSP, we can calculate that for GV IS=20-25 there is 90-92% chance to have two electrons
or more reaching the element following the R-MHSP, and these have high probability to be focused
into its holes and be further multiplied and detected.

Fig. 5 shows the currents measured (setup of Fig. 3a) on the R-MHSP anode strips IRA, and on
the bottom electrode IBOT , as function of the anode-to-cathode strips voltage, D VAC. Vhole was kept
constant at 410V, resulting in avalanche gain in the holes ∼500, as derived from (IRA + IBOT )/IPC0
(the electron current on the cathode strip was nearly zero). Eind and Edri f t were kept at 1 and
0.5kV/cm, respectively. While the sum of both currents is constant, varying D VAC changes the
current sharing between these two electrodes, namely the charge extraction from the R-MHSP
holes to the next element (i.e. change of visible gain). As much as it is desirable to increase D VAC
to divert more ions to the cathode strips, the drop in visible gain (Fig. 5b) sets a limitation on this
variable, at about 70V, corresponding to visible gain ∼25. This value could be further raised if
the loss of electrons could be compensated by a further increase of Vhole, but from our experience
Vhole=410V is already quite a high, though safe, operation voltage. Another possibility to maintain
visible gain ∼25 with higher D VAC is by raising Eind, as depicted in Fig. 5c. The data in Fig. 5c
conﬁrms the well known [9, 25] linear dependence of the visible gain on the induction ﬁeld. It
should be noted that the data of Fig. 5c only were taken with an R-MHSP of smaller holes (50
microns), which explains the minor difference in visible gain compared to Fig. 5b.

The IBF reduction capability of the R-MHSP was studied (Fig. 3b) with an R-MHSP followed
by a GEM, of which the avalanche acts as the source of back-ﬂowing ions. The R-MHSP was
biased at Vhole= 410V; the GEM was biased at 420V (gain ∼2000); the transfer ﬁeld in the gap
between them was Etrans=1kV/cm and the drift ﬁeld was Edri f t =0.5kV/cm. The total avalanche
current in this conﬁguration was measured as the sum of currents from the bottom anode and
from the bottom GEM electrode. The IBF was calculated as the ratio of the PC current under
multiplication, to the total avalanche current. Fig. 6a shows the IBF measured in these conditions,
as function of the total gain of both elements; the latter was adjusted only by varying the voltage
difference between the R-MHSP strips (D VAC). The IBF was reduced by a factor of 3 and the visible
gain was reduced by a factor of 5 while raising D VAC from 0V (GEM-like mode) to 70V. In Fig. 6b,
the same IBF variation caused by raising D VAC, is shown for different transfer ﬁelds. With a higher
transfer ﬁeld the visible gain is higher and D VAC can be further raised:
thus at Etrans=1kV/cm,
D VAC was varied from 0V to 70V while at Etrans=2 and 3kV/cm, D VAC was raised to 100 and 240V,
respectively; the maximal D VAC values correspond to R-MHSP visible gain of ∼25. However, as is
obvious from Fig. 6b, the IBF for different transfer ﬁelds is rather similar, and the best performance
is with Etrans=1kV/cm.

3.2 R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP cascaded multiplier.

The R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP cascaded-multiplier conﬁguration shown in Fig. 3c was chosen based
on the reduced IBF with an MHSP as a last-stage MHSP [19] and its further potential reduction by

an R-MHSP as a ﬁrst element. Note, however, that their optimization are opposite and although in
both operation modes the IBF reduces with increased strips voltage difference, in the MHSP this
increase means higher total gain while in the R-MHSP it means lower visible gain. The optimized
ﬁelds conﬁguration suggested in [19] was combined with the insight from the R-MHSP study
above, and we chose the following parameters (see Fig. 3c): Edri f t =0.5kV/cm; Etrans1=1kV/cm;

transport suppression) and Eind=-4kV/cm in order to collect ions at the bottom mesh cathode. The
ﬁrst R-MHSP voltages were: Vhole1=410V; D VAC1=70V following the results above. The GEM
voltages were: VGEM1=VGEM2=280V, equivalent to a gain of 60 on each. The bottom MHSP
voltages were: Vhole2=300V between the top and cathode strip electrodes; we have varied D VAC2 on
the bottom MHSP, to vary the total gain of the detector.

Fig. 7. The total gain of the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP cascaded multiplier of Fig. 3c, as function of the
anode-to-cathode voltage difference, D VAC2, of the last MHSP element: Edri f t =0.5kV/cm, Vhole1=410V,
D VAC1=70V, Etrans1=Etrans2=0.28kV/cm, VGEM1=VGEM2=280V, Vhole2=300V, Eind=-4kV/cm.

The total gain as function of D VAC2 on the bottom MHSP is plotted in Fig. 7. A charge
multiplication of 50 was achievable on the anode strips of the bottom MHSP, by raising the strip
voltage D VAC2 to 290V, in accordance with the results of [19].

The recorded IBF is presented in Fig. 8 as function of the total gain, for drift-ﬁeld values
of 0.1, 0.2kV/cm (TPC conditions) and 0.5kV/cm (GPM conditions). In the GPM-like operation
mode, the lowest IBF was 1.5*10−3 at a detector total gain of 1.5*105. It means that per a single-
photon event, on the average 200 ions reach the PC. The IBF recorded at the same total gain
in the TPC operation mode (drift ﬁeld of 0.1kV/cm) is ∼4*10−4, which is ∼5 times lower, as
expected from the linear dependence of IBF on the drift ﬁeld discussed in [8]. At a drift ﬁeld
0.2kV/cm the IBF is intermediate, of 7*10−4 at a total gain 1.5*105. Note that the IBF curves of
the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP cascaded-multiplier (Fig. 8) drop as IBF=C/Gtot , C being a constant,
over the entire total gain range; this is in contrast with the case of the 3GEM/MHSP multiplier
with reﬂective PC [19], shown for comparison in Fig. 8, where the IBF decreases slower than
1/Gtot at total gains above 2*104. Based on the deﬁnitions of IBF (IBF=IPC/IA) and total gain
(Gtot = IA/IPC0), it is clear that C = IPC/IPC0, which means that at a given drift ﬁeld, the PC ion
current is constant and does not increase with D VAC2. In other words, all ions created at the anode
strips of the MHSP do not reach the PC, which demonstrates full ion suppression by the electrode

cascade preceding the MHSP strips. On the contrary, with the 3GEM/MHSP detector an increasing
fraction of ions from the anode strips reach the PC, pointing at a poorer ion trapping capability of
this cascade.

3.3 2R-MHSP/MHSP cascaded multiplier with a reﬂective PC.

An important conﬁguration of cascaded gaseous photomultipliers is that with a reﬂective photo-
cathode deposited on top of the ﬁrst multiplying element, a GEM [25] or a THGEM [31].
In
addition to the higher QE values of reﬂective photocathodes, in this conﬁguration the sensitivity to
ionizing-particle background is considerably reduced [25], because the gaseous drift gap is prac-
tically eliminated. The best IBF recorded so far in a reﬂective-PC GPM, of IBF=3%, was in a
3GEM/MHSP conﬁguration with the photocathode deposited on the top GEM [19]. We have in-
vestigated a few other solutions, among them a double R-MHSP followed by a MHSP, with a CsI
photocathode deposited on the top R-MHSP [3] (Fig. 3d).

The drift gap above the photocathode, deﬁned by a mesh electrode placed at a distance of
3.5mm above the top surface of the R-MHSP (Fig. 3d), was biased to have Edri f t =0kV/cm, which
according to [25, 31] provides the best photoelectron collection efﬁciency from the photocathode
into the nearest hole. It was demonstrated that a slightly reversed ﬁeld in this gap repels negative
charges deposited there and signiﬁcantly reduces the sensitivity to charged-particles background
[32], at the expense of a minor (few percent) drop in photoelectron detection efﬁciency [25]. We
studied the IBF under these conditions, with Edri f t =-0.1kV/cm. In our experiment the potential
across the hole of the ﬁrst R-MHSP, Vhole1=400V, ensured photoelectron extraction from the PC
above 90%; the anode-to-cathode strip voltage was set to be D VAC1=50V and the ﬁrst and the

– 12 –

second transfer ﬁelds were set to rather high values, to provide a visible gain >20 for the ﬁrst R-
MHSP element and further good electron transfer to the last MHSP element:Etrans1=3kV/cm and
Etrans2=5kV/cm; the induction ﬁeld was Eind=-8kV/cm; the second R-MHSP and the last MHSP
were biased at rather high values of Vhole2=450V and Vhole3=430V across the holes, respectively.
This however, allowed setting D VAC2 at the second R-MHSP to 100V for better trapping of ions
from the last MHSP.

Total gain

Fig. 9. The IBF as a function of the total gain for the 2R-MHSP/MHSP detector (of Fig. 3d) with reﬂec-
tive photocathode on ﬁrst R-MHSP top electrode, for two different drift ﬁelds. Experimental conditions:
Vhole1=400V, D VAC1=50V, Etrans1=3kV/cm, Vhole2=450V, D VAC2=100V, Etrans2=5kV/cm, Vhole3=430V, Eind=-
8kV/cm. Shown for comparison (open diamonds) is the IBF for a 3GEM/MHSP detector with a reﬂective
PC [19].

The IBF in the 2R-MHSP/MHSP detector with reﬂective PC is shown on Fig. 9 for two
different drift ﬁelds: 0 and -0.1kV/cm (reversed ﬁeld). The lowest IBF recorded is 3*10−3 in the
total gain range of 105 - 7*105 (Fig. 9). The plots for both drift ﬁelds are nearly the same and start
saturating at total gain ∼105. This, to our opinion, is due to non optimal operation conditions: 1) a
too low D VAC1 at the ﬁrst R-MHSP and 2) a too high Etrans2 compared to the value of 0.2-0.5kV/cm
in [19]. However, the IBF values achieved in the present study are by an order of magnitude better
than the best value obtained so far with 3GEM/MHSP detector + reﬂective PC [19], at a total gain
of 105, shown for comparison in Fig. 9.

4. Conclusions and discussion.

In this work we have continued our long ongoing studies of IBF reduction in cascaded electron
multipliers, searching for further improvements that will permit their operation with a visible-light
sensitive (e.g. bialkali) PC. Following the 5-fold IBF reduction of the MHSP as a last cascade-
element [19] and the preliminary results with the reversed-bias R-MHSP as a ﬁrst cascade-element
[24], we further studied the ion trapping properties of the R-MHSP. These were systematically

– 13 –

investigated with R-MHSP as a stand-alone element, as a ﬁrst element in a R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP
cascaded multiplier and in a reﬂective-PC gaseous photomultiplier based on 2R-MHSP/MHSP
multiplier.

We found that raising the anode-to-cathode voltage in the R-MHSP from 0V (GEM mode) to
-70V (R-MHSP mode) led to a 3-fold reduction of the IBF. We further evaluated the associated
reduction in the visible gain of the R-MHSP ﬁrst element and we argue that it can be maintained
sufﬁciently high to ensure good detection efﬁciency of single-electron events: with hole multipli-
cation ∼500, a transfer ﬁeld 1kV/cm and anode-to-cathode voltage -70V the visible gain is 25,
implying that in 92% of the events at least two electrons are transferred to the following element in
the cascade.

The R-MHSP was investigated in an R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP and 2R-MHSP/MHSP detector
conﬁgurations, combining a CsI photocathode operated in semitransparent and reﬂective mode
correspondingly. For the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP with a semitransparent PC, the drift ﬁeld between
the photocathode and the R-MHSP was selected to simulate GPM and TPC operation conditions.
For the 2R-MHSP/MHSP detector with reﬂective PC, the drift ﬁeld between the PC and the mesh
was set either at 0kV/cm (corresponding to maximum photo-electron extraction from the PC) or
slightly reversed (-0.1kV/cm), in order to decrease the detector’s sensitivity to charged-particles
background.

4.1 GPM with semitransparent PC:

In the semitransparent-PC R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP GPM, the IBF was found to be inversely pro-
portional to the total gain; its best value in GPM-like mode (Edri f t =0.5kV/cm), compatible with
good single-electron detection efﬁciency, was 0.15% at a total gain of 1.5*105. This IBF is too
high for a stable operation of the multiplier in combination with a visible-light sensitive photocath-
ode (e.g. bialkali), due to the high emissivity of these photocathodes; for example, with a bialkali
PC, the 225 ions (1.5*105 x 0.015) impinging on it per single-photoelectron event will induce on
the average 8 secondary electrons [15, 16]. Thus at least an 8-fold IBF reduction is further required
to bring the gain-limiting secondary avalanches to an acceptable level.

A further IBF reduction will also prolong the photocathode’s lifetime, affected by the ion im-
pact. At present the photocathode lifetime of the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP GPM can be estimated,
for example, from the recently measured aging rate of a bialkali PC: 20% loss of QE at an accu-
mulated ion charge of 2m C/mm2 on a K-Sb-Cs PC [3, 5]. With a photon ﬂux of 1kHz/mm2 and a
QE=30%, such charge will be accumulated during 7 years of operation at a total gain of 105 and
with IBF=2*10−3.

It should be noted that the IBF reduction with the present multiplier conﬁguration is superior
to that presented in our previous work [24]; it is a result of a better-quality MHSP electrodes and a
combination of an R-MHSP and MHSP as ﬁrst and last elements, respectively.

4.2 GPM with reﬂective PC:

In the reﬂective-PC 2R-MHSP/MHSP GPM the IBF was found to be 7-5 times lower than in the
previously reported reﬂective-PC 3GEM/MHSP GPM [19], in the total gain range 105 - 106. It is
in general more difﬁcult to block the ions when using a reﬂective PC directly deposited on top of

– 14 –

the hole-multiplier, because the ﬁeld values and directions on this surface are dictated solely by the
hole dipole ﬁled, and under the large multiplication in the holes (dictated by gain considerations)
this ﬁeld is rather high [25]. Nevertheless, the R-MHSP as a ﬁrst (and second) element indeed
provides further IBF reduction.

4.3 TPC operation mode:

Due to the almost linear dependence of IBF on drift ﬁeld, it is 5-10 times smaller in TPC operation
mode compared to GPM one. In the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP detector and with Edri f t =0.1kV/cm,
the IBF is 4*10−3 and 4*10−4 at total gas gains of 1.5*104 and 1.5*105, respectively. It means that
per single-electron multiplication event, ∼60 ions ﬂow back to the drift region, independent of the
gain.

The present study was motivated by the need to reduce the IBF in GPMs and therefore the
structures under study were primarily adjusted for single-photoelectron detection conditions at high
total gain (∼105). However, the majority of IBF studies [8, 12, 13] with multi-GEM detectors
were carried out at lower gains (104), oriented towards TPC operation. With the presently studied
multiplier conﬁgurations and ﬁelds, the IBF value in TPC-mode and at total gain ∼104 is practically
not improved compared to the best results obtained so far with asymmetric 3-GEM cascade [12].
However, we expect that a better optimization of the R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP multiplier in TPC-
mode conditions (total gain 104 and Edri f t=0.1kV/cm) will further reduce the IBF. On the contrary,
at total gain 105, one order of magnitude improvement was achieved, compared to [19] as discussed
above, and compared to [8] with a 3-GEM detector and Edri f t =0.5kV/cm, reaching IBF=0.02 at
total gain 6*104.

An idea to further reduce the IBF might be the use of single, or several R-MHSPs with anode
and cathode strips patterned on both faces. According to our preliminary studies of an R-MHSP
mounted with the strips facing the drift region (ﬂipped R-MHSP), an increase of the anode-to-
cathode voltage difference did not affect much the R-MHSP gain in the holes; in addition, the
cathode strips, now facing the drift region, seem to efﬁciently capture the back-ﬂowing ions from
successive cascade elements. The results of these studies will be reported in another article.

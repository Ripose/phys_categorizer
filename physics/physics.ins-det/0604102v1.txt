Abstract

Eight PbWO4 crystals produced for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment at LHC
have been irradiated in a 20 GeV/c proton beam up to ﬂuences of 5.4 × 1013 p/cm2. The damage
recovery in these crystals, stored in the dark at room temperature, has been followed for over a year.
Comparative irradiations with 60Co photons have been performed on seven other crystals using a dose
rate of 1 kGy/h. The issue whether hadrons cause a speciﬁc damage to the scintillation mechanism
has been studied through light output measurements on the irradiated crystals using cosmic rays. The
correlation between light output changes and light transmission changes is measured to be the same for
proton-irradiated crystals and for γ-irradiated crystals. Thus, within the precision of the measurements
and for the explored range of proton ﬂuences, no additional, hadron-speciﬁc damage to the scintillation
mechanism is observed.

1 Introduction

The way large hadron ﬂuxes affect PbWO4 crystals has become relevant with the construction of LHC [1]. For the
−1,
CMS experiment, charged hadron ﬂuences have been calculated [2] for an integrated luminosity of 5 × 105 pb
which nominally corresponds to 10 years of running at LHC, yielding in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL)
barrel up to ∼ 1012 and in the end caps ∼ 1014 charged hadrons/cm2. It had to be ascertained whether such ﬂuxes
cause a speciﬁc, possibly cumulative, damage, and if so, what its quantitative importance is and whether it only
affects light transmission (LT) or also the scintillation mechanism. A hadron-speciﬁc damage could arise from the
production, above a ∼20 MeV threshold, of heavy fragments with up to 10 µm range and energies up to ∼100
MeV, causing a displacement of lattice atoms and energy losses, along their path, up to 50 000 times the one of
minimum-ionising particles. The damage caused by these processes is likely to be different from the one caused
by ionising radiation and could be cumulative.

In a study we have published recently [3], the primarily investigated quantity was the damage to light transmission,
because it can be measured very accurately. Furthermore, all damage observed in earlier tests [4, 5] could always
be ascribed to the ionising dose associated with the hadron ﬂux, apart from some indication for a hadron-speciﬁc
damage in BGO, which can be extracted [6] from existing data. None of the previous tests on lead tungstate was
extended however to the full integrated ﬂuences expected at the LHC.

Eight CMS production crystals of consistent quality were irradiated at the IRRAD1 facility of the CERN PS ac-
celerator T7 beam line [7] in a 20 GeV/c proton ﬂux of either 1012 p cm−2h−1 (crystals a, b, c, d, h) or of
1013 p cm−2h−1 (crystals E, F, G) 1). These crystals have the shape of truncated pyramids with nearly parallelepi-
pedic dimensions of 2.4 × 2.4 cm2 and a length of 23 cm. The exact ﬂuxes and ﬂuences each crystal was exposed
to are listed in Ref. [3]. The maximum ﬂuence, of 5.4 × 1013 p/cm2, was reached for crystal a”. To disentangle
the contribution to damage from the associated ionising dose, complementary 60Co γ-irradiations were performed
at a dose rate of 1 kGy/h on further seven crystals (t, u, v, w, x, y, z) at the ENEA Casaccia Calliope irradiation
facility [8], since a ﬂux of 1012 p cm−2h−1 has an associated ionising dose rate in PbWO4 of 1 kGy/h. The max-
imum dose of 50.3 kGy was reached for crystal v, just a factor ∼ 2 below the dose reached in proton irradiations,
which for a” was 97.5 kGy.

The study of transmission damage revealed that proton irradiation decreases the light transmission for all wave-
lengths and moves the ultra-violet LT band-edge to longer wavelengths, as can be seen in Fig. 9 of Ref. [3]. In
γ-irradiated crystals, the band-edge does not shift at all, even after the highest cumulated dose: only the well-known
absorption band [9] appears around 420 nm. These data demonstrate the qualitatively different nature of proton-
induced and γ-induced damage. The correlation we found, between the induced absorption coefﬁcient at the peak
of scintillation-emission wavelength, µIN D(420 nm) [3], and ﬂuence, is consistent with a linear behaviour over
two orders of magnitude, showing that proton-induced damage in PbWO4 is predominantly cumulative, unlike
γ-induced damage, which reaches equilibrium [9, 10]. The data for µIN D versus light wavelength for proton-
irradiated crystals show a λ−4 dependence, which is absent in γ - irradiated crystals. This is an indication of
Rayleigh scattering from small centres of severe damage, as it might be caused by the high energy deposition
of heavily ionising fragments along their path, locally changing the crystal structure. Taking into account the
difference in composition and energy spectra between 20 GeV/c protons and CMS, simulations indicate that the
test results cover the CMS running conditions up to a pseudorapidity of ∼ 2.6. An experimental conﬁrmation is
expected from a planned pion-irradiation of PbWO4, closer to the CMS particle spectrum average [3].

However, the relevant quantity for detector operation is the scintillation light output (LO). Detector calibration
through a light injection system, as foreseen by CMS [11], can only work, as long as changes in light output are
all due to changes in light transmission. This had been veriﬁed extensively so far for ionising radiation, but for
high hadron ﬂuxes it still had to be established: the present work deals with this question. In the following, the
measurement setup and technique are described, the data analysis is explained, and results are given, in comparison,
for proton-irradiated crystals and for γ -irradiated crystals.

2 The setup
Light output from a crystal is commonly measured in the laboratory using photons from a 60Co or 137Cs source
to excite scintillation. The light output is then determined from the position, in the spectrum, of the photoelectric
peak produced by photons which deposit all their energy in the crystal. For lead tungstate crystals, the light output

(or third) irradiation of the same crystal.

is modest, ∼ 10 photoelectrons/MeV of incoming particle energy, as detected on the bialkali photocathode of a
photomultiplier (PM) covering the whole back face of the crystal. Thus, the photoelectric peak is broadened by
statistical ﬂuctuations and merged with the Compton edge. In the present study, the hadron-irradiated crystals
will remain radioactive for years, and thus act as sources for γ and β emission over an extended range of energies,
peaked at the lowest detectable values and tailing off towards larger ones. The photoelectric peak from any common
laboratory γ source is swamped by this spectrum, and a different method of LO determination had to be adopted.

As an alternative, cosmic muons passing a crystal transversely were used. These muons deposit 24.5 MeV in the
crystal, an energy deposit which is well above all γ energies emitted by radioactive isotopes. Using these muons
to excite scintillation gave us a light output well above the crystal’s own background.

An individual crystal was placed in horizontal position, with plastic scintillator counters above and below, to
select nearly vertical muons. Since only a relative measurement of LO loss was sought, large rectangular plastic
scintillators were used, 24 cm long and 23 cm wide, sitting at 22 cm distance above and below the crystal. These
counters yielded a large angular acceptance, allowing for muons traversing the crystal at angles between 0o and
37o from the vertical, leaving thus an energy deposit Edep between 24.5 MeV and 30.6 MeV.

Figure 1: Spectrum for crystal F’.

For LO measurements, each crystal was wrapped in TyvekTM [12] on all sides but its large end, which was coupled
via an air gap to a Philips XP2262B bialkali-photocathode PM equipped with a standard CERN base type 4238.
A PVC centering tube was used for reproducible positioning. The photomultiplier was operated at a gain of
∼ 108. The current pulses from its anode were fed into an Analog-to-Digital converter 2249W from LeCroy,
which has a sensitivity of 0.25 pC. Data acquisition was performed with a PC running a Labview 7.0 virtual
instrument, interfaced via a HYTEC 1331 controller [13] to a CAMAC crate. The data acquisition was triggered
by a coincidence of the signals in both plastic scintillator counters. A CAMAC-controlled Programmable Dual
Gate and Delay Generator LeCroy 2323A deﬁned a 200 ns ADC charge integration time. The acquisition of
a spectrum with sufﬁcient statistics for one LO measurement typically took 24 h, yielding approximately 8000
events in the muon energy deposition peak. The ambient temperature was recorded at the beginning and at the
end of each measurement, since the lead tungstate LO changes by −2%/oC [14, 11] at room temperature, and the
light output determined for each run was corrected ofﬂine to its value at 18oC. The uncertainty on the correction,
coming from possible, undetected ﬂuctuations of temperature in the crystal over the duration of a run, amounts to
0.4% and is negligible compared to the other error sources affecting the LO determination, as discussed below. The
anode signal was attenuated at the input, by typically 24 db, for the acquisition of a muon spectrum. Keeping the
same PM high voltage, the stability of the setup, from the PM multiplication chain to the ADC, was monitored by

2

periodically acquiring the spectrum of single photoelectrons thermally emitted by the photocathode. In this case,
the anode signal from the PM coupled to the crystal was used for self-triggering, with no attenuation before the
ADC input, and the discriminator threshold was set low enough to see the valley below the single photoelectron
peak, according to the method we described in Ref. [10]. Pedestal data were acquired at the beginning of every
run, and subtracted on a run-by-run basis. Since we could not exclude a priori that the crystal radioactivity would
affect the detection efﬁciency of the setup over time, we also periodically monitored the stability of the setup by
acquiring the cosmic muons spectrum from a non-irradiated reference crystal, and, when necessary, corrected all
data for relative gain changes. This procedure allowed to monitor the whole light detection chain, including the
photocathode quantum efﬁciency.
As an example, Figure 1 shows a cosmic muons spectrum for F’ after an irradiation with 9.83 × 1012 p/cm2,
where the crystal experienced a considerable damage in light transmission, corresponding to an induced absorption
coefﬁcient of ∼ 3 m−1. The sharp rise which is clearly visible below channel 100 is due to light produced by the
radioactivity of the crystal.

damage can be observed, along with some accidental changes (see text).

Great care had to be given to sources of systematic errors in the measurements. For precise relative LO loss
measurements, the geometrical acceptance of each crystal for triggered muons was kept constant from one mea-
surement to the next, to ensure keeping the average muon energy deposit, < Edep >, always at the same value.
This was achieved by placing each crystal every time in the same position and orientation in the setup. The remain-
ing uncertainty has been evaluated from the ﬂuctuation of the various LO measurements for the reference crystal.
This was done separately for the period where proton-irradiated crystals were measured, whose irradiations were
performed between May and October 2003, and for the period where γ-irradiated crystals were monitored, which
were exposed to protons in May 2004 and measured over the following 7 months. Reproducibility of positioning
was signiﬁcantly improved over time as a result of the learning process. The corresponding, relative uncertainty on
LO measurements was determined as the σ of the distribution of values for the reference crystal. For γ-irradiated
crystals it amounts to 1.7% and for proton-irradiated ones, to is 2.4%, except on the data before irradiation for
crystals a and F, which were taken before monitoring the system stability with frequent reference crystal mea-
surements, and where it amounts to 3.8%. This uncertainty affects every LO measurement, and it is thus added in
quadrature to the statistical errors. However, the LO change, which we want to correlate with the damage to light
transmission, is determined as the ratio between light output at a given time after irradiation and the light output
before irradiation. The uncertainty on the light output measurement before irradiation thus affects, as an overall
scale uncertainty, the whole set of data for each crystal.

Figure 3: Correlation between µIN D(420 nm) and LO loss for proton-induced (top) and γ-induced (bottom)
damage. See the text for the systematic scale uncertainty on the data (not shown).

Direct contact was initially used between crystal and PM face, but it resulted, for the reference crystal and for the
proton-irradiated ones, in the chipping of a few corners, due to the repeated positioning of the crystals in the setup.
This caused a small, but noticeable loss of collected light with respect to the natural, room-temperature damage
recovery (see Fig. 2), since the surface of the large face was slightly reduced by the accident. To reduce the risk
of chipping, a sheet of polyethylene foam was thus ﬁrst wrapped around the Tyvek, to protect the long chamfers.
This resulted in a small rise of LO signal (see Fig. 2) because of the slight change of crystal positioning on the
photocathode, whose efﬁciency is position-dependent. Further, four tiny felt pads were applied, as a protection, to
the corners of the big end face, masking 6% of it. The LO decreased slightly this way, due to the reduced area for
light collection (Fig. 2). Since the amount of chipping was different from crystal to crystal, and since the changes
cannot be necessarily disentangled from damage recovery, no correction was applied to the data for these systematic
shifts, but we include a relative systematic uncertainty of 4% from this effect on the LO measurements for p-
irradiated crystals. The crystals irradiated with photons are not affected by this uncertainty, since the protection
was adopted before the reference data taking prior to irradiation. Furthermore, for crystal G one should notice in

4

Fig. 2 the LO difference between the value at 180 days and the one at 270 days after irradiation: this rise is due to
a step in the damage recovery, as it can be appreciated in the corresponding LT recovery data of Fig.11 in Ref. [3],
which originated from an accidental, prolonged exposure of the crystal to ﬂuorescent room light.

The correlation between µIN D(420 nm) and LO loss is shown at the top of Fig. 3 for all proton-irradiated crystals.
One should notice the very important damage for a”, which reached µIN D(420 nm) ≃ 15 m−1 after a ﬂuence
of 5.4 × 1013 p/cm2 and experienced a corresponding LO loss of nearly 96%. The correlation for all γ-irradiated
crystals is shown in the bottom part of Fig. 3. The overall, relative, systematic scale uncertainty affecting the results
amounts to 1.7% for γ-irradiated crystals and to 4.7% for p-irradiated ones, except for crystals a and F, where it is
5.5%.

Within the precision of our measurements, a clear correlation is observed between loss of light transmission, ex-
pressed through µIN D(420 nm), and the relative LO loss, both, for hadron-irradiated crystals and for γ irradiated
ones. Furthermore, the two correlations are compatible within the precision of our measurements. Thus, in the
range of proton ﬂuxes and ﬂuences used for the present irradiations, no hadron-speciﬁc alteration to the crystal
scintillation properties has been observed.

5 Conclusions
A set of lead tungstate crystals of CMS production quality have been exposed to 20 GeV/c proton ﬂuxes up to
5.4 × 1013 p/cm2. For comparison, a different set of similar quality lead tungstate crystals have been exposed to
an equivalent amount of 60Co γ-radiation in terms of ionising dose rate and dose. Measurements of changes in
scintillation light output have been performed and correlated with light transmission changes. Within the precision
of our measurements, the correlations for proton-irradiated and for γ-irradiated crystals are compatible. Thus,
for the crystals tested, and within the range of particle ﬂuxes and ﬂuences considered, we do not observe any
additional, hadron-speciﬁc alteration of lead tungstate scintillation properties.

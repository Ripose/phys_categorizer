Abstract

An accelerator beam experiment was performed using a low-energy antiproton
beam to measure the antiproton detection eﬃciency of the BESS detector. Mea-
sured and calculated eﬃciencies derived from the BESS Monte Carlo simulation
based on geant/gheisha showed good agreement. With the detailed veriﬁcation
of the BESS simulation, results demonstrate that the relative systematic error of
detection eﬃciency derived from the BESS simulation is within ± 5%, being previ-
ously estimated as ± 15% which was the dominant uncertainty for measurements
of cosmic-ray antiproton ﬂux.

1 Introduction

The BESS spectrometer was designed [1,2] and developed [3–6] as a high-
resolution spectrometer with the capability to search for rare cosmic-rays and
provide various precision measurements of cosmic-ray primaries.

Since 1993, seven balloon ﬂights have been successfully carried out and more
than 103 antiprotons (¯p’s) have been unambiguously detected. This has allowed
measuring the energy spectrum of cosmic ¯p’s [7–10] exhibiting a characteristic
peak around 2 GeV, being expected due to the existence of “secondary” ¯p’s
produced by cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas. Since at energies be-
low this peak the secondary ¯p’s show a sharp decrease due to the kinematics of
¯p production, this allows performing a sensitive search for a possible compo-
nent of low-energy “primary” ¯p’s which could be produced by novel processes
such as annihilation of neutralino dark matter or evaporation of primordial
black holes [11].

Investigating the origin of low-energy ¯p’s requires a reduction in systematic er-
rors of the resultant spectrum, as well as a reduction in statistical errors. The
dominant source of systematic error in the low energy region (< 1 GeV) is un-
certainty in the ¯p interaction losses in the instrument. For the BESS detector,
we surmised ± 15% relative error in detection eﬃciency which is evaluated us-
ing a Monte Carlo simulation (BESS MC) [12] based on the geant/gheisha
code [13,14]. The BESS MC incorporates detailed material and detector de-
scriptions such that realistic detector performance is obtained. The original
gheisha code was modiﬁed so that experimental data of ¯p-nuclei cross sec-
tions [15] are reproduced. Proton-nuclei cross sections below 1 GeV are also
modiﬁed based on the LaRC model calculation [16]. However, estimating sys-
tematic error due to interaction losses is diﬃcult because of uncertainties in
secondary multiplicity, angular distribution, and detector response; thus mak-
ing these losses the dominant source of systematic errors of ¯p ﬂux, especially
in the low energy range. Accordingly, detection eﬃciency must be directly
measured and precisely veriﬁed to reduce systematic error in the low-energy
region ¯p ﬂux.

Considering this, we performed an accelerator beam experiment at the KEK-
PS K2 beam line, i.e., the BESS detector was evaluated using a low-energy
¯p and proton beam. The main objectives of the beam experiment were as
follows:

(1) directly measure detection eﬃciencies for ¯p’s and protons;
(2) evaluate the BESS MC simulation;
(3) reduce systematic error in detection eﬃciency for ¯p’s.

Simultaneously measuring detection eﬃciencies for ¯p’s and protons helps to

2

achieve (2) and (3) because they behave similarly in the instrument except for
deﬂection in the magnetic ﬁeld and inelastic interactions.

Section 2 brieﬂy summarizes the BESS detector, while Section 3 deﬁnes the de-
tection eﬃciency. Main features of the accelerator beam setup and a summary
of collected data are presented next in Section 4, after which Section 5 de-
scribes incident beam identiﬁcation which determines the number of detector
incidence particles. Measurement of the detection eﬃciency is then presented
in Section 6, with a comparison between beam data and simulation results
being discussed in Section 7 along with an evaluation of systematic error in
detection eﬃciency. Finally, Section 8 summarizes the main results and pro-
vides conclusions.

ﬁeld of 1 Tesla is produced by a thin (4 g/cm2) superconducting coil [4],
with substantial incident particles passing through without interaction. The
magnetic-ﬁeld region is ﬁlled with a tracking detectors composed of a jet type
drift chamber (JET) and inner drift chambers (IDCs). This geometry results
in an acceptance of 0.3 m2sr, being an order of magnitude larger than those of
previous cosmic-ray spectrometers. Tracking is performed by ﬁtting up to 28
hit-points in the drift chambers, resulting in magnetic-rigidity (R ≡ P c/Ze)
resolution of 0.5% at 1 GV. Energy deposit in the drift chamber gas is also
obtained as a truncated mean of the integrated charges of hit pulses. The
upper and lower scintillator-hodoscopes (TOF) [6] provide two dE/dx mea-
surements and the time-of-ﬂight of particles. The instrument also incorporates

3

a threshold-type Cherenkov counter [5] with a silica-aerogel radiator that can
identify ¯p’s from a e−/µ− background up to a kinetic energy of 4 GeV. Here,
cylindrical coordinates (r, φ, and z) and Cartesian coordinates (x, y, and z)
are used for representing the BESS instrument, where y and z are respectively
the vertical axis and axis of the solenoid.

Although the BESS detector has been successively upgraded since the ﬁrst
successful ﬂight in 1993, the basic concept of particle identiﬁcation is the same,
i.e., mass determination using the rigidity and velocity of incident particles.
Accordingly, the presented beam results can be applied to both past and future
detectors.

3 Detection Eﬃciency

ε =

Nobs
Ninc

,

The detection eﬃciency (ε) of ¯p’s (protons) is deﬁned as

where Ninc is the number of incident ¯p’s (protons) within the acceptance of
the detector, and Nobs is the number of particles identiﬁed as ¯p’s (protons).

Due to the symmetrical detector conﬁguration of the BESS instrument, since
non-interacting antiprotons behave like protons except for deﬂection, we ap-
plied the same selection criteria as protons for ¯p identiﬁcation. In ﬂight data,
protons are obtained with suﬃcient statistics using unbiased samples, since
they are the most abundant species in cosmic radiation.

Antiproton selection is performed using the following cuts [10]:

(1) select events with a single downward-traveling particle fully contained in

the ﬁducial region of the tracking detectors;

(2) require only one (one or two) hit in the upper (lower) TOF hodoscopes;
(3) require TOF hit position consistency with the r − φ and y-z trajectory;
(4) require loose dE/dx consistency with protons in upper and lower TOF

(5) require track quality to ensure correct measurements such as reduced

(6) perform particle identiﬁcation using reconstructed mass and three dE/dx

hodoscopes;

chi-square of track ﬁtting;

measurements.

Nobs is obtained by applying cuts (1)–(6) to Ninc, i.e., together they deﬁne
detection eﬃciency. In the analysis of ﬂight data, interaction losses are esti-

4

mated using the BESS MC, while other eﬃciencies can be precisely estimated
by proton samples. Cuts (1)–(4) are expected to be suﬃcient to reject all
inelastically interacted events which are “visible” in the instrument. If, for
example, an interaction occurs at the bottom of the instrument, then it may
not be detected by applying cuts (1)–(6) and therefore be “invisible” to the
instrument. Together cuts (1)–(4) are denoted as CUT.

The detection eﬃciency can be decomposed into two factors, i.e.,

ε = εnon−int · εID,

where εnon−int is the eﬃciency of CUT, called the non-interacting eﬃciency,
and εID is the eﬃciency of (5) and (6) after applying CUT, called the identiﬁ-
cation eﬃciency. Since no diﬀerence exists in εID between protons and ¯p’s, the
detection eﬃciency can be expressed as

ε(¯p) = εnon−int(¯p) · εID(¯p) = εnon−int(¯p) · εID(p).

Considering the above equations, since εID(p) can be precisely estimated using
ﬂight data, systematic error in detection eﬃciency can be evaluated using
only εnon−int(¯p) in the beam experiment, although εID(¯p) = εID(p) should be
conﬁrmed.

4 Experimental

4.1 Beam line setup

The BESS beam experiment was performed in February 1999 at the KEK-PS
K2 beam line which is equipped with an electro-static separator [17] to en-
rich low energy ¯p’s. The BESS detector was located 8 m downstream of the
focal point because the E373 experiment [18] was being run in parallel. The
resultant beam proﬁle at the detector was about 20 cm (W) × 10 cm (H), be-
ing a beam spread in which detector performance is uniform. Figure 2 shows
a schematic view of the experimental setup. D1 and D2 are dipole magnets
and Q1–Q7 are quadrapole magnets used for beam transport and focusing.
KURAMA is another dipole magnet for analyzing momentum of incident par-
ticles. By adjusting magnet current, the deﬂection angle at KURAMA was
maintained at 8◦ irrespective of beam momentum. The BESS detector was
rotated circumferentially 70◦ in r-φ plane such that it was suitably positioned
in the beam line for proper beam incidence.

5

Fig. 2. Experimental setup of K2 beam area for BESS beam experiment.

Other than our detectors, there was more than 3 g/cm2 of materials in the K2
beam line, thus interaction and energy losses of incident particles cannot be
neglected. To reject interacted events and identify incident particles, we placed
four trigger counters (T1–T4), two drift chambers (DC1 and DC2), and an
aerogel Cherenkov counter (AC) in the beam line. A right-handed coordinate
system is obtained in which the z-axis is in the beam direction, the y-axis is
vertical and upwards, and the origin is at the center of the BESS detector
position. Detector positions are also shown in Fig. 2.

Each trigger counter consists of a 1-cm-thick Bicron BC404 plastic scintillator.
Two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are mounted on each end of the plastic
scintillator through acrylic light guides. Trigger counters are also used for
charge-amplitude/timing measurements for oﬀ-line analysis. Energy deposit
(dE/dxT1, etc.) in each counter and particle velocity (βT4−T1, etc.) between
counters were measured. The timing resolution of each counter is 30 to 40 ps.
A wider T4 is used in order to obtain better statistics for low energy ¯p’s.

Drift chambers (DCs) with a full drift length of 1 cm use a mixture of
50–50 % Ar-ethane gas. Each DC has three planes of wire layers in both the
horizontal and vertical plane such that 3D tracking is obtained. The position
resolution of each hit is about 150 µm. In order to measure the deﬂection an-
gle at KURAMA, DC1 and DC2 were placed on both sides of it. The incident
position and angle into the BESS detector were obtained from the combined
track (referred to as the beam track) ﬁtted DC1 and DC2 hits.

The aerogel Cherenkov counter (AC) uses an 8-cm-thick silica aerogel block
with refractive index of 1.03 as a Cherenkov radiator. Light output (QAC) is
collected by four PMTs mounted on the counter. The veto of QAC is integrated

6

into the trigger system which remarkably improves the ¯p/π ratio. The AC
functions as a threshold type Cherenkov counter during oﬀ-line analysis for
¯p/π separation. The mean number of photoelectrons was about 13, resulting
in a rejection factor of more than 104. Main parameters of these detectors are
summarized in Table 1.

Data from the BESS detector and beam line detectors is collected using the
BESS data acquisition system. To obtain Ninc, instead of using the BESS
standard trigger (coincidence between upper and lower TOF counters), the
trigger was generated by T1 & T2 & T3 & T4 and AC. Trigger timing was
adjusted such that the diﬀerence compared to the BESS standard trigger was
less than 5 ns, which did not aﬀect measurable quantities. The trigger rate
was kept below several kHz to maintain gain stability of the TOF hodoscopes.

4.2 Beam incidence into BESS detector

Since the BESS detector exhibits uniform performance over a wide region due
to the simple cylindrical geometry and uniform magnetic ﬁeld, there is no need
to perform a detailed position/angle scan of detection eﬃciency. Data was col-
lected for three diﬀerent detector conﬁgurations. The incident beam position
was changed by changing BESS conﬁguration in the beam line. Each conﬁgu-
ration, i.e., CFG1, CFG2, and CFG3, is shown in Fig. 3. As these conﬁgurations
were selected to represent the incidence of cosmic-ray particles in terms of the
amount of material and penetrated region, a total test of the BESS MC can
be performed by combining the data from the three conﬁgurations.

7

The BESS detector cannot be rotated more than 70 ◦ due to a constraint in
the liquid helium storage, and therefore low energy protons (Pinit < 1.0GeV /c)
were out of the BESS acceptance region in this beam experiment.

Fig. 3. Cross-sectional view of BESS detector with incident ¯p beam for each con-
ﬁguration (CFG1–3). Using CFG1 as a reference, CFG2 is the case in which the
incident beam has an angle of cosθ = 0.915, where θ is deﬁned as the angle between
the beam and y-axis in the y-z plane. CFG3 is the case in which the incident beam
passes through a diﬀerent region of the central tracking system in the r-φ plane.
The distance of incident position between CFG1 and CFG3 is 153 mm along the
x-axis.

4.3 Data summary

Table 2 summarizes the collected ¯p and proton data. The initial beam mo-
mentum (Pinit) is deﬁned by current settings of D1 and D2, which has a mo-
mentum spread of ± 3%. Data on pions, deuterons, and helium nuclei were
also collected, although data analysis will be reported elsewhere. CFG1+Al
represents a conﬁguration in which a 30-mm-thick aluminum plate was placed
just upstream of the BESS detector. As indicated, initial beam momentum
was scanned with each conﬁguration. While more than 10,000 events were
collected to obtain suﬃcient statistics, only about 1,000 events were collected

8

for very low energy ¯p’s (Pinit < 0.70 GeV/c) due to low production rate and
losses during beam transport.

5.1 Beam identiﬁcation

To determine Ninc the beam line detectors must clearly identify the incident
particle and precisely determine incident position, angle, and energy. In order
to select ¯p and proton events, the following cuts were applied on the beam
experiment data set:

(1) a good beam track exists in beam line detector DC1 and DC2;
(2) the incident particle has proper deﬂection angle at KURAMA;
(3) dE/dx in T1, T2, T3 and T4 are compatible with ¯p’s;
(4) 1/β between T2−T1, T3−T1, T4−T1, T3−T2, T4−T2, and T4−T3 are

consistent with that of ¯p’s;

(5) light particles are rejected by QAC veto.

Together these cuts are referred to as BID0. The most eﬀective cuts are
1/βT4−T3 and dE/dxT4 cut, although the QAC cut is also important because
it rejects a part of the interacted events in T4 and AC itself. Figure 4 shows
examples for BID0 for ¯p’s of Pinit = 1.67 GeV/c, where the 1/β distribution
shows a clear separation between ¯p, kaon, and pion/muon/electron particles
which allows incident beam particles to be unambiguously identiﬁed.

The hatched histogram indicates events survived after applying BID0.

The incident kinetic energy at the top of instrument (ETOI) was derived from
βT4−T3. The accuracy of energy determination was 1% in the very low energy
region around 0.2 GeV where energy resolution is important. Around 1 GeV,
energy determination is obtained with 5% accuracy. Systematic error of the
absolute energy is estimated to be ± 1% due to calibration of the time of ﬂight
measurements and energy losses in the beam line. The incident position and
angle were obtained by extrapolating the beam track to the BESS detector
considering the fringing ﬁeld produced by the BESS solenoidal magnet. The
accuracy of the incident position and angle around 1 GeV were 2.5 mm and 2
mrad (rms deviation), respectively.

In order to compare the beam data and BESS MC results, a MC data set
was generated as follows. To estimate interaction and energy losses in T4 and
AC, which were located just upstream of BESS, they were included in the
simulation. Input kinematics of beam particles was obtained by beam data
event by event; i.e., the incident position and angle were determined by beam
track, while the incident energy was determined by 1/βT4−T3. This allows
comparisons between beam data and MC results under the same conditions.
Data sets are referred to as BEAM and MC, respectively.

5.2 Additional beam identiﬁcation for BESS

Although beam identiﬁcation was performed by BID0 as mentioned above,
contamination on Ninc due to interaction and/or scattering of incident par-
ticles after DC2 was not negligible. It is therefore important to ensure that
incident particles arrive at the top of instrument by adding cuts to BID0,
with information from the upper TOF hodoscope being used for this purpose.
Such information must be carefully used so as not to reject interaction events

10

occurring in BESS.

In addition to BID0, the following cuts were applied:

(1) number of hits in the upper TOF hodoscope is one or more;
(2) beam trajectory agrees with upper TOF hit position in both r-φ and y-z

plane.

These cuts are referred to as BID1, which includes BID0.

Under this approach, an incident particle is guaranteed to pass through T4
and AC without large angle scattering or interaction. The percentage of BID1
rejected events which interacted in the BESS instrument is only 1% at most,
whereas most interacted events in T4 or AC are rejected.

After applying BID1, the mass of the incident particle was calculated using
the incident velocity determined from the TOF measurement between T4 and
the upper TOF; a value should be consistent with that of ¯p’s. Since the BEAM
and MC mass distributions showed very good agreement, it is concluded that
BID1 completely removes the eﬀect of T4 and AC such that Ninc is precisely
determined.

5.3 Systematic errors in beam experiment

Precise estimation of systematic errors and making accurate corrections are
critical to obtain absolute value of the eﬃciencies. Possible sources of beam
related systematic errors are

(1) beam dump eﬀect;
(2) accidental track identiﬁcation;
(3) beam identiﬁcation using the upper TOF;
(4) accuracy of the beam energy determination.

Each of these errors is respectively evaluated.

5.3.1 Beam dump eﬀect

With a ¯p beam, some TOF counters recorded hits with delayed timing, i.e.,
around 0.7% of Ninc, being the result of reentrant secondary particles generated
by annihilation at the beam dump. Some of these tracks were observed in
the JET chamber. To correct this eﬀect on non-interacting eﬃciency when
applying CUT, during oﬀ-line analysis the delayed hits were not included in
the number of hits in upper and lower TOF hodoscopes; thereby eliminating

11

the beam dump eﬀect such that its correction was negligible. The resultant
systematic error (δεbeam dump) is accordingly estimated as

δεbeam dump ∼ 0.002.

5.3.2 Accidental track identiﬁcation

An additional track was present in some events that was not related to a trig-
gered particle. Such accidental tracks aﬀect non-interacting eﬃciency when
selecting a single particle event. Since “slow gas” is used in the BESS cham-
bers (JET/IDCs), the drift time is relatively long so that accidental tracks can
easily appear in the tracking detectors. Since production probability of an ac-
cidental track is in general proportional to incident beam intensity, accidental
tracks appeared at most 3% of Ninc, being about 1% for a ¯p beam and below
0.3% for a proton beam according to beam intensity.

When applying the single particle selection of CUT, an accidental track should
be ignored. However, the only way to determine if a multi track event is an
accidental or actual interaction is to check whether or not it has a vertex
inside the instrument. An accidental track which exists close to the track
of a triggered particle would therefore be misidentiﬁed as an interaction. As
this ineﬃciency is about 15%, the correction (dεaccidental) to the eﬃciency is
estimated as

0.001 < dεaccidental < 0.005,

with the systematic error (δεaccidental) due to this correction being estimated
as

δεaccidental < 0.001.

This value is smaller for protons due to smaller incident beam intensity.

5.3.3 Beam identiﬁcation using upper TOF

As described in Section 5.2, BID1 can eﬀectively conﬁrm that non-interacting
particles are incident into the BESS instrument. However, since CUT will also
reject a small fraction of interacted events in BESS, a correction is needed.
Using the BESS MC, the amount of correction (dεbeam ID) is estimated as

−0.01 < dεbeam ID < −0.005,

where it is equally applied to both BEAM and MC.

12

Evaluation of systematic error is also needed in terms of correspondence be-
tween BEAM and MC, being estimated by varying the cut parameters of BID1.
The rms deviation of the diﬀerence in eﬃciency between BEAM and MC was
used to represent the systematic error, i.e.,

δεbeam ID ∼ 0.005,

which is comparable to the statistical error of the eﬃciencies. With this ap-
proach there is no large systematic error incurred using information from the
upper TOF.

5.3.4 Accuracy of beam energy determination

Since there is systematic uncertainty of about ± 1% in beam energy determi-
nation, measured eﬃciency is aﬀected where it changes rapidly with energy.
In fact, it is diﬃcult to reliably estimate the eﬀect of systematic errors on
measured eﬃciency in such an energy region.

5.3.5 Total error in direct measurement of non-interacting eﬃciency

The correction (dε) and total error (δε) in εnon−int were obtained using

dε = dεaccidental + dεbeam ID

δε2 = δε2

statistic + δε2

beam dump + δε2

accidental + δε2

beam ID,

where δεstatistic denotes the statistical error.

6 Results

6.1 Direct measurement of non-interacting eﬃciencies

Figure 5 shows for each conﬁguration the non-interacting eﬃciency for ¯p’s and
protons derived from BEAM data and MC results. Note that the error bars
include both statistical and systematic uncertainties while they are too small
to see in the ﬁgure. Exceptionally close agreement between BEAM and MC
occurs above ∼0.2 GeV, although large discrepancies exist below this energy
where non-interacting eﬃciency rapidly drops due to stopping of incident ¯p’s in
the instrument. As mentioned in Section 5.3.4, such discrepancies may be due
to the accuracy of the beam energy determination, with systematic uncertainty

6.2 Relative diﬀerence in non-interacting eﬃciency between beam and BESS

MC data

The relative diﬀerence in non-interacting eﬃciency between BEAM and MC
((∆ε/ε)non−int = (εMC − εbeam)/εbeam) for ¯p’s and protons is shown in Fig. 6
from 0.16 to 1.0 GeV for ¯p’s (0.4 to 1.0 GeV for protons), where the measured
data can be used as a reference of the non-interacting eﬃciency with well-
estimated errors. Note that good agreement between BEAM and MC exists for

Since each point of Fig. 6 corresponds to the systematic discrepancy of non-
interacting eﬃciency derived from BESS MC data for a given energy and
conﬁguration, these results are considered to clearly indicate that above 0.16
GeV (for protons above 0.4 GeV) calculated eﬃciencies are correct within ±
5%, although for ¯p’s above 0.5 GeV small but signiﬁcant discrepancies are
present.

7 Discussion

While non-interacting eﬃciency has been directly measured, BESS MC results
are nevertheless needed to estimate the non-interacting eﬃciency because (i)
eﬃciencies over the whole BESS ﬁducial are required, (ii) the detection ca-
pability of ¯p’s ranges up to 4.2 GeV, and (iii) the conﬁguration of BESS has
changed year by year. Since non-interacting eﬃciency is the output of complex
processes, a detailed systematic study of the BESS MC simulation is essential
to evaluate its reliability. Systematic errors in the simulation should accord-
ingly be evaluated using the results obtained in the previous section. Together
with this, sources of discrepancies in non-interacting eﬃciency for ¯p’s above
0.5 GeV will be discussed.

7.1 Systematic study of BESS MC related to material amount

The amount of material included in the simulation was investigated ﬁrst. Pro-
ton and helium (albedo proton) samples in ﬂight data can be used to examine
the amount of material in the lower (upper) half of the instrument. That is,
if the stopping energy is deﬁned as the energy where dE/dx in lower (upper)
TOF counter begins to decrease due to the incident particle being stopped
inside the counter, then the stopping energy of these samples measured in the
JET provides the total energy loss of the incident particle after it, a behavior
that was well-reproduced by the simulation. Regarding BEAM data, on the
other hand, the stopping energy for CFG1 and CFG3 is 0.154 and 0.160 GeV,
respectively, being in good agreement with simulation results within ± 2 MeV
and close to the accuracy of the incident energy determination. The BESS MC
is therefore correct in terms of the amount of material.

15

7.2 Systematics of BESS MC related to interactions

Interaction processes, being the most important feature of the simulation,
were investigated secondly. Antiproton events in MC can be classiﬁed into
four categories, i.e.,

(1) no interaction (including delta-ray and multiple scattering eﬀect);
(2) elastic scattering (diﬀraction scattering);
(3) inelastic scattering (incident ¯p survives);
(4) annihilation.

Note that (2) – (4) are processed in a hadronic package. Generally, about 70
to 90% of the elastically scattered events pass through CUT, while it rejects
most inelastically scattered and annihilated events; although in comparison,
inelastically scattered events have a higher survival probability. It is important
to realize that survival probability is dependent on the interaction point in the
instrument and hadronic packages. Figure 7 shows the inelastic and elastic
cross sections for ¯p to aluminum used in the BESS MC, as well as those of the
original gheisha code, fluka code, and experimental data [15]. Note that
the inelastic cross section includes both inelastic scattering and annihilation
processes. The solid curves are ﬁt with these data points and used in the BESS
MC.

To study hadronic interaction processes, it is beneﬁcial to compare gheisha
results with a diﬀerent hadronic package. Accordingly, we used fluka [19]
implemented in geant3.21 (gfluka). This version of fluka, however, is
out of date because the fluka standalone code has undergone continuous
development over the last decade.

Our investigation showed that

(1) The inelastic scattering probability is diﬀerent between gheisha and
gfluka, with that of gfluka being overestimated whereas that of
gheisha is reasonable (see Section 7.2.1 for details);

(2) For annihilation cases, although gheisha exhibits some problems in sec-
ondary multiplicity and angular distribution such that gfluka is pre-
ferred, this discrepancy does not aﬀect the non-interacting eﬃciency (see
Section 7.2.2 for details);

(3) Losses due to elastic scattering are larger in gheisha than in gfluka
because of the diﬀerence in angular distributions, with gheisha being
preferred since non-interacting eﬃciency agrees better with BEAM using
empirically determined cross sections.

Based on these ﬁndings, we conclude that gheisha is suﬃciently reliable for
our purpose.

curves are ﬁt with these data points and used in the BESS MC. The dash-dot curve
is a new ﬁt that better reproduces the results of the beam experiment.

Finally, surmising that about 10% relative error is present in our empirical
ﬁt (solid curve of Fig. 7) to the ¯p-nuclei cross section data, it then seems
reasonable to tune them in order to reproduce εnon−int of BEAM for ¯p’s above
0.5 GeV. Moreover, among all measured ¯p-nuclei cross section data, that of
Kuzichev et al. [15] are annihilation cross sections not total inelastic cross
sections. Therefore, assuming about 10% probability of inelastic scattering in
this energy range, which is consistent with the gheisha code, we reﬁt the
data below 15 GeV. With this approach to using these cross sections (see
dash-dotted line of Fig. 7), εnon−int was well reproduced up to 1 GeV.

Several kinds of implementation of hadronic packages are used to study the
eﬀect of diﬀerences in cross sections, generation of secondary particles, and
their eﬀects on eﬃciencies, i.e.,

gheisha(orig) : original gheisha;
gheisha(bess) : gheisha with total inelastic cross section modiﬁed for BESS

(solid line of Fig. 7);

: gfluka with same inelastic cross section as gheisha(bess);
: gfluka with same inelastic cross section and same proba-

bility of inelastic scattering as gheisha(bess);

gfluka3

: gfluka tuned by total inelastic cross section to reproduce

non-interacting eﬃciency of BEAM data.

7.2.1 Cross sections

Data of both ¯p’s and protons were taken using a conﬁguration in which a
30-mm-thick aluminum plate was placed just upstream of the BESS detector
(see CFG1+Al of Table 2).

A check of the ¯p-aluminum cross sections was performed by comparing the
non-interacting eﬃciency assuming that the aluminum plate was included in
the BESS instrument. When an interaction occurs in the aluminum, it is as-
suredly well detected in the BESS detector regardless whether the event is an-
nihilation or inelastic scattering. Good agreement within ± 2% was obtained
with gheisha (bess) when the aluminum plate was placed in the same posi-
tion, while εnon−int decreased by ≈ 10%. However, a discrepancy of the same
magnitude (∆εnon−int ≈ 0.015) was found for ETOI > 0.5 GeV as shown in
Fig. 6. On the other hand, when using gfluka3 as the hadronic package,
∆εnon−int ≈ −0.015 was obtained for ETOI > 0.5 GeV while gfluka3 well re-
produced εnon−int without the aluminum plate. These results can be explained
by the overestimation of inelastic scattering probability in gfluka.

7.2.2 Multiplicity and angular distribution of secondary particles

When eﬃciencies are compared at each reduction step of CUT, if gheisha
(bess) was used as the hadronic package, then the diﬀerence in eﬃciencies
between BEAM and MC becomes smaller as the cuts are added together. In
contrast, however, with gfluka2 this diﬀerence did not change as the cuts
were added together. Since both these hadronic codes have the same elastic
and inelastic cross sections, this behavior is due to secondary multiplicity and
angular distribution.

The discrepancy between BEAM and MC(gheisha(bess)) should therefore
be observed in the distribution of secondaries generated during instrument
interactions. This was accordingly investigated by comparing the timing dif-
ference (∆tU) between upper TOF counters using the events of NU > 1 for
¯p’s as shown in Fig. 8, where NU indicates the number of hit counters in the
upper TOF. The vertical axis is normalized to total incident ¯p’s, and ∆tU

corresponds to the sum of the time of ﬂight of an incident particle from the
upper TOF counter to the interaction point and that of a secondary particle
from the interaction point to another upper TOF counter. The peaks around
3 and 10 ns correspond to events in which interaction occurred at the up-
per and lower coil, respectively. The discrepancy seen in the peak around 3
ns clearly indicates that the rate of secondaries generated toward the upper
TOF hodoscope is higher in BEAM than in MC(gheisha(bess)) for ¯p’s. On
the other hand, a comparison of ∆tU shows good agreement for protons (not
shown). The discrepancy in the ∆tU distribution accordingly indicates that the
gheisha code has some problems in reproducing secondary multiplicity and
angular distribution in cases of annihilation events. The dotted histogram in
Fig. 8 corresponds to results obtained using gfluka2 vice gheisha (bess),
where in terms of secondary distribution, gfluka is preferred to gheisha.

In the case of annihilation, when comparing the survival probability of CUT be-
tween gheisha(bess) and gfluka2, the diﬀerence is less than ± 0.3%, and
gheisha(bess) gives higher probability on the average. Thus, even though
gheisha exhibit some problems in secondary multiplicity and angular distri-
bution for annihilation events, the eﬀect on non-interacting eﬃciency is quite
small. This is because of excellent capability of detecting interactions with
much independent information and uniform performance of the BESS detec-
tor.

7.3 Systematics of BESS MC related to detector descriptions

The detector description in the BESS MC was also investigated. As previously
mentioned, estimating the eﬀect on εnon−int due to discrepancies in the detector
description in MC is complicated because distinguishing those in the detector
description from those in hadronic processes is diﬃcult. However, no discrep-
ancy need be explained by detector response because εnon−int was successfully
reproduced by the BESS MC for all conﬁgurations for ¯p’s and protons, with
BESS MC estimating only a 1% loss for non-interacted events when applying
CUT. Losses are instead caused for example by adjacent TOF hits, tail of the
dE/dx distributions, or other reasons. Furthermore, since CUT for εnon−int is
a geometrical and loose cut which removes only tails of the distribution, it
should be robust against detector response and calibration, while this is not
the case for determining eﬃciency which includes a track quality cut such as
reduced χ2 and number of ﬁtted points selection. Thus, possible discrepan-
cies in detector description are not considered to aﬀect the non-interacting
eﬃciency.

7.4 Reproduction of non-interacting eﬃciency for various conﬁgurations

Since it is impossible to completely reproduce interaction processes and de-
tector response, reproducibility of eﬃciencies for various conﬁgurations is im-
portant. To study this, the maximum deviation of ∆εnon−int between all con-
ﬁgurations (δεCFG) were calculated for all energies, i.e.,

δεCFG ∼ 0.005.

Since CFG1–3 were selected to represent the incidence of cosmic-ray particles
in terms of the amount of material and tracking region, the fact that δεCFG
was kept suﬃciently low demonstrates the validity of the non-interacting eﬃ-
ciencies derived from BESS MC over the whole ﬁducial region.

7.5 Comparison of identiﬁcation eﬃciency with BESS MC data

Identiﬁcation eﬃciency was investigated lastly. While it can be estimated us-
ing unbiased proton samples in the ﬂight data, the assumption that εID(¯p) =
εID(p) must be conﬁrmed using BEAM data. Figure 9 shows the ¯p/p ratio of the
identiﬁcation eﬃciency (rID ≡ εID(¯p)/εID(p)), where the open histogram indi-
cates MC data in which an isotropic beam was incident to the instrument such
that a value of unity was present over the whole energy range. Note that rID

of BEAM shows good agreement with the histogram and MC, which conﬁrms
that εID’s were the same for protons and ¯p’s; hence “visible” interactions are
completely removed by CUT and only non-interacting eﬃciency contributes
to the systematic error due to interaction losses in detection eﬃciency.

7.6 Systematic error in detection eﬃciency

Since the BESS MC was validated and εID(¯p) = εID(p) was conﬁrmed, the sys-
tematic error in detection eﬃciency over the whole BESS ﬁducial can be eval-
uated by the relative diﬀerences in non-interacting eﬃciency between BEAM
and MC. Based on the eﬃciency calculation in ﬂux measurements (eﬃciencies
are averaged over the whole acceptance region), all data of CFG1–3 were com-
bined and δεCFG were added into the errors for each data point. This is shown
in Fig. 10 together with the systematic error used in the previous analysis,
being estimated as 15, 12, and 10% in the energy range of < 0.3, 0.3–0.5,
and 0.5–1.0 GeV, respectively. As shown, the accelerator beam calibration
conﬁrmed that the BESS MC gave reasonably correct detection eﬃciencies,
and reduced the systematic error in detection eﬃciency for ¯p’s to within 5
and 4% from 0.16 to 0.3 and 0.3 to 1.0 GeV, respectively; and for protons to
within 2% from 0.4 to 1.0 GeV (represented by closed circles obtained with
gheisha(bess)). In addition, the use of modiﬁed cross sections reproduces
detection eﬃciency exactly and the systematic error in detection eﬃciency
can be reduced to ± 2% from 0.3 to 1 GeV for ¯p’s (represented by open circles
obtained with gheisha(new)).

tained with gheisha(new). The dashed line in (a) is the previous systematic error
attributed to detection eﬃciency.

Discrepancies in non-interacting eﬃciency above 0.5 GeV have now been dis-
cussed in detail and the BESS MC itself is well understood, thus allowing
the systematic error in detection eﬃciency above 1 GeV to be estimated.
That is, based on the relative diﬀerence in non-interacting eﬃciency among
several hadronic packages (gheisha(bess), gheisha(new), gfluka(orig),
gfluka2, and gfluka3), the systematic error in detection eﬃciency above
1 GeV is estimated to be within ± 5%.

8 Summary and Conclusions

Through the accelerator beam experiment, the absolute calibration of the de-
tection eﬃciency for ¯p’s and protons were performed below 1 GeV, and the
BESS Monte Carlo simulation was veriﬁed in detail. The calibration remark-
ably reduced the relative systematic error in detection eﬃciency derived from
the simulation, especially for ¯p’s. It can be applied to systematic errors in
cosmic-ray ¯p measurements (i.e., ¯p ﬂux[8–10]), as well as forth coming data
from 1999/2000 ﬂights and future BESS experiments including high statis-
tics long-duration ﬂights[20] providing the instrumental features of BESS are
maintained. By increasing the reliability of the cosmic-ray ¯p spectrum, these
results will enable us to carry out the most sensitive-ever investigation on the

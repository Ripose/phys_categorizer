Abstract

×

Eight production quality PbWO4 crystals of CMS have been irradiated in a 20 GeV/c proton beam up
1013 cm−2. The damage recovery in these crystals has been followed for over a
to ﬂuences of 5.4
year. Comparative irradiations with 60Co photons have been performed on seven other crystals using
a dose rate of 1 kGy/h. In proton irradiated crystals the light transmission band-edge shifts and the
λ−4. In γ-irradiated crystals the band-edge does not shift but
induced absorption length µIND(λ)
formation of absorption bands is seen clearly. The absorption length induced by γ-radiation in crystals
veriﬁed to have excellent radiation hardness, saturates at a level below 0.5 m−1. In the case of protons,
we observe no correlation with the pre-characterised radiation hardness of the crystals and the induced
1013 cm−2, an induced absorption
absorption increases linearly with ﬂuence. After a ﬂuence of 5
15 m−1 is seen with no sign of saturation. These observations provide strong evidence
length of
that high-energy protons create damage that cannot be reproduced with γ-irradiation. However, these
hadronic effects manifest themselves only at integral ﬂuences well beyond 1012 cm−2 and most likely
would escape undetected at lower ﬂuences. A large fraction of the damage, both in proton- and γ-
irradiated crystals, is either stable or recovers very slowly.

1 Introduction

Lead Tungstate (PbWO 4) crystals will be used by several high-energy physics experiments [1, 2, 3] because they
provide a compact homogeneous calorimeter with fast scintillation. In view of their use in the CMS experiment,
where the calorimeters will face the harsh LHC conditions, the radiation hardness of PbWO 4 crystals has been
extensively studied over the last decade[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These studies have mostly been done at γ-irradiation
facilities, complemented with some neutron tests at reactors [10]. At LHC, however, calorimeters will also be
108 s−1 minimum bias pp interactions
exposed to a large ﬂuence of high-energy hadrons, resulting from up to 8
at √s=14 TeV.

×

Although the radiation damage caused by minimum ionising particles in PbWO 4 has been thoroughly studied
by the γ-irradiations, this cannot be considered sufﬁcient for LHC applications. In particular, the fundamental
difference between few MeV photons and energetic hadrons – the effects of nuclear interactions in the crystal –
has not been investigated in detail so far. Some pion irradiations have been performed [11, 12] but no systematic
study has been extended up to the full integrated hadron ﬂuences expected at the LHC, although the neccessity of
this has been advocated long ago [13].

Inelastic nuclear interactions break up the target nucleus and thus create impurities and distortions in the crystal
lattice. These effects, however, are expected to be negligible at LHC ﬂuences, since the natural impurity concen-
tration of the crystals is relatively high. Another unique feature of hadronic interactions is the very dense ionisation
of the created heavy nuclear fragments, which can have a range of up to 10 µm. Along their path they displace a
large number of lattice atoms, but also ionise much more densely than a minimum ionising particle. In PbWO4
the fragments with highest ionising dE/dx are known to come from ﬁssion of lead and tungsten where the cross
section for such reactions exceeds 100 mb [14]. Typical ﬁssion fragments, like Fe and Zr in Fig 1, have energies
up to 100 MeV. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the dE/dx for such fragments is four orders of magnitude larger
than for minimum-ionising protons – indicated by the solid dot in Fig 1. Since the thresholds to induce ﬁssion are
several hundred MeV, tests with reactor neutrons or low-energy protons are not suitable to probe this regime.

nuclear fragments causes the crystals to become radioactive, up to a level which does not allow handling them for
several weeks after exposure. Any front-end electronics or optical system, like photomultipliers, laser or ﬁbre is
also susceptible to damage in the hadron beam and would make the determination of an effect in the crystal itself
more complicated. Therefore our aim was to make the simplest possible test we could imagine. We irradiated
bare crystals and measured the light transmission after irradiation. Our study was targeted at stable or very slowly
recovering damage after a proton ﬂuence of up to 5

1013 cm−2.

2 The crystals

For our studies we used PbWO 4 crystals produced by the Bogoroditsk Techno-Chemical Plant (BTCP) in Russia
for the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the CMS experiment [1]. The crystals have the shape of truncated
2.4 cm2 transversely and 23 cm length. All crystals were
pyramids with nearly parallelepipedic dimensions of 2.4
×
of production quality, and only because of slightly non-compliant mechanical dimensions or mild mechanical
surface damage they could not be used in the ECAL construction. In particular, they were all pre-characterised
for their radiation hardness through γ-irradiation at the Geneva Hospital 60Co facility following a standard CMS
qualiﬁcation procedure. Throughout the paper we will refer to the results of this pre-characterisation as µγstd
IND(420).
The studies presented here concentrated on an examination of the change in longitudinal transmission (LT) at a
wavelength of 420 nm, which corresponds to the peak emission of PbWO 4 scintillation light. The CMS technical
speciﬁcations [15] require the radiation-induced absorption coefﬁcient

at λ=420 nm to be below 1.5 m−1 for a saturated damage from γ-irradiation at
100 Gy/h. In Eq. 1 LT0 (LT ) is
the longitudinal transmission value measured before (after) irradiation and ℓ is the crystal length (23 cm) through
which transmission is measured.

≈

For the proton irradiations we had 12 crystals at our disposal. In order to minimise the effect of crystal-to-crystal
variations, we selected for our irradiation 8 crystals which showed the most consistent behavior in optical charac-
teristics and in terms of µγstd
IND(420). The selected crystals are listed as a–h in Table 1.
For the γ-irradiations, performed at a dose rate corresponding to 1012 p/cm2, we used further 6 crystals, from a
later production, which are listed as u–z in Table 1. The pre-characterisation of these 6 crystals was done for 1 h
at 350 Gy/h which increases µγstd
IND(420) by about 10% [16] with respect to 2 h at 250 Gy/h, as used for the other
crystals. Crystals u, v and w were of very good quality while the three others showed after the pre-characterisation
quite high µγstd
IND(420) values. Two of them (x and z) were actually outside of the CMS speciﬁcations. In addition
to these 6, one of those remaining from the earlier 12, was considered good enough to be used in the γ-irradiations
and is labelled as t in Table 1.

The target dose rate in the γ-irradiations was 1–2 kGy/h but an exact analysis of the actual rate is presented later.
Throughout this paper we use the convention to assign small letters to crystals irradiated at a dose rate of
1 kGy/h
10 kGy/h. A prime or a double-prime after the crystal identiﬁer
and capital letters to those irradiated at rates of
indicates a second or third irradiation of the same crystal.

The tirr times given in Table 1 for the proton irradiations are the target values but the actual ﬂuences were deter-
mined by standard activation techniques. For the γ-irradiations, performed in static and very stable conditions, the
tirr values are the actual exposure times which are used in the dose determination.

3 Irradiations
For the proton irradiations we used the IRRAD1 facility [17] in the T7 beam line of the CERN PS accelerator,
which at the time of our ﬁrst irradiations was delivering a proton beam of 20 GeV/c and during a later campaign
24 GeV/c. In order to obtain a uniform irradiation over the whole crystal front face, we requested a special beam,
which had not been produced before in that facility. In particular, we asked for the lowest beam intensity which
the PS could provide in a controllable way in the T7 beam line.

4.5 cm2. At 24 GeV/c a further
At 20 GeV/c we obtained a ﬂux of
intensity reduction by a factor of 2 was reached. The uniformity was not perfect over the whole beam spot, but a
fairly uniform area covering the crystal could be found. In this low-intensity mode the PS was delivering on average
one proton spill every 42 seconds. The duration of the spill was 600 ms at 20 GeV/c and 400 ms at 24 GeV/c.

1012 cm−2h−1 over an area of roughly 4.5

×

∼

In order to investigate a possible rate dependence, we performed some irradiations at a higher intensity, of
∼
1013 cm−2h−1. To achieve this, the spill frequency was increased to 2 spills every 14 s and the beam spot was
3 cm2 which was still sufﬁcient to cover the crystal while maintaining an acceptable
reduced to a size of about 3
beam uniformity.

×

The crystals were brought into the beam by a remotely controlled shuttle. The beam was hitting the small front
face of the crystal and was parallel to the long crystal axis.

The γ-irradiations were performed at the Calliope plant of ENEA-Casaccia, Italy. The facility provides a 60Co
source which at the time of our irradiations had a total activity of 750 TBq. The 48 source rods were arranged
in two concentric cylinders of about 20 cm outer radius and 26 cm height. We irradiated simultaneously up to 5
crystals, standing side-by-side at a distance of 40 cm from the source centre, with their long side parallel to the
source axis. Each crystal was housed in its own styropor box. The distance between two adjacent crystals was
about 34 mm. In order to obtain as uniform an exposure as possible, each box was turned once by 180o around its
long axis at half-time through its exposure. Unfortunately the crystals could not be precisely adjusted with respect
to the source and an offset of 52 mm remained along the axis. Thus one extremity of the crystals was slightly less
exposed.

4 Measurement methods

4.1 Light transmission

The LT measurements were taken with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer for wavelengths between
300 and 800 nm in 1 nm steps. Since the grating which allows to select the desired wavelengths polarises light, we
used a wide-band depolariser to be reasonably free of polarisation effects. The width of the beam is deﬁned by
the slit opening which ﬁxes the wavelength distribution: this we set to ∆λ = 1 nm which yields about 7 mm beam
size. The height was adjusted with a “common beam mask” to approximately 10 mm.

We will discuss later the implications of non-uniform proton beam proﬁles, which required us to align the crystals
in a reproducible way. For each measurement we checked that the entry and exit points of the light were centred
on the crystal face. The accuracy of this alignment was roughly
1 mm. Measurements with intentionally larger
displacements showed this to be sufﬁciently good not to introduce signiﬁcant variation for any of our crystals.

±

For each proton-irradiated crystal, at least one set of LT measurements was performed, where the light was passed
not only through the centre, but also as close to each of the four sides as possible. The information gained from
these “scans” served the purpose of understanding effects of beam non-uniformities.

Before each session of measurements we experimentally veriﬁed the absolute calibration of the device by measur-
ing the LT of a non-irradiated reference crystal. Fig. 2 shows the results of these measurements as a function of
time at 420 nm. From the scatter of the points we derive a 1σ deviation of 0.58%. However, close to the band-edge
the transmission changes rapidly and the accuracy of the wavelength dominates. We were able to reproduce the
scatter of the reference crystal LT close to the band edge, if we assumed that the wavelength is reproduced with

where δLT (λ) is the difference between two adjacent LT points, 1 nm apart. The second term is signiﬁcant only
close to the band edge, when δLT (λ) can be as big as three percent-units per nm. At large wavelengths, when the
transmission changes slowly with λ, the error is given by the ﬁrst term alone.

4.2 Induced radioactivity
The induced radioactivity dose rate ( ˙Dind) was measured with an Automess 6150AD6 [18] at a distance of 4.5 cm
from the long face of the crystal at its longitudinal centre. The device was calibrated to yield the photon equivalent
dose, which is the quantity extracted from the simulations described in appendix A.

The reference point of the sensitive element in the 6150AD6 is reported to be 12 mm behind the entrance window.
Thus our actual distance was 57 mm from the crystal face. The ˙Dind values of the least active crystals were
comparable to natural background, which we determined by integrating over a long period with the 6150AD6. In
order to verify the linearity of the device even at low counting rates, we also measured the dose from a standard
point-like 137Cs source at various distances. Both methods gave a background of 0.06 µSv/h and we observed no
dependence on counting rate.

The nominal energy range of the 6150AD6 is 60 keV–1.3 MeV. Below 60 keV the efﬁciency drops abruptly, but in
our crystals only a negligible fraction of dose comes from low energy photons. The efﬁciency curve [18], which
rises steeply above 1 MeV, is cut at 1.3 MeV, which marks the end of the calibrated range. Our assumption of
constant efﬁciency above this energy most likely leads to an underestimate of our simulations with respect to the
measured values.

˙Dind provides a means to approximately
Since PbWO4 attenuates photons quite efﬁciently, a measurement of
determine the proton beam uniformity. For this purpose ˙Dind was measured on all long sides for each crystal.
Although the attenuation is exponential, a simple average over the four sides gives the total activation with an
accuracy of a few percent even for our most non-uniform irradiations.

All

˙Dind measurements were prolonged sufﬁciently to reduce the statistical uncertainty to the level of 1–2%.

Since the crystals are longer than one hadronic interaction length, the protons initiate an intense hadronic cascade.

scattered radiation cannot be ignored.

In order to properly understand the radiation ﬁeld within and around the crystal – and in particular the inﬂuence
on the determination of the incident proton ﬂuence – a full simulation of the irradiation setup was performed with
the FLUKA code [19]. For the simulations, the crystal shape was described as a 23 cm long truncated equal-sided

the same rate. But these tests cannot be considered sufﬁcient to exclude possible cumulative effects because they were not

appropriate to use, instead of dose rate, a purely hadronic quantity against which we could plot the damage.

The incident proton beam is practically monoenergetic but, due to cascade formation, the hadron spectrum within
the crystal, shown in Fig. 4, comprises all energies from sub-MeV neutrons to full beam energy. Table 2 shows the
integral ﬂuences at beam energy and above 20 MeV – the threshold indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 4. With
such a wide energy spectrum and since a dependence between damage and hadron energy cannot be excluded a
priori, it is not obvious how damage could be related to hadron ﬂuence.

It is plausible that any damage unique to hadrons should be caused by the component of the hadron spectrum which
is producing inelastic interactions. The most suitable quantity to describe the radiation ﬁeld for our purpose, is
called star density, which was originally introduced to parametrise radioactivity induced by hadron irradiation [21].
A star is deﬁned as an inelastic hadronic interaction caused by a projectile above a given threshold energy. This
means that the star density is actually the integral of the total hadron ﬂuence above a given threshold, weighted by
the inelastic cross section. The star density is exactly zero for irradiations with low energy photons or neutrons
below the threshold energy, which we take as 20 MeV. For constant beam conditions the star density is of course
proportional to the ﬂuence. In our analysis we will prefer the latter because it can be experimentally determined
with good accuracy. The simulated star densities, however, will be used to scale between different beam energies
and to compare different radiation environments.

Since the radioactivity produced in the crystal is roughly proportional to the rate at which stars are produced [22],
a measurement of ˙Dind in a crystal can provide an estimate of the star density. This is discussed in more detail in
appendix A.

5.2 60Co source

The dose rates at the Calliope plant [23] are well known from measurements, performed regularly by the operators.
However, these values refer to dose in air or water in the absence of scattering material. In order to determine
the dose proﬁle within the crystals, detailed simulations of the irradiation setup were mandatory. Fig. 5 shows the
FLUKA simulation model of the source and 5 crystals in their boxes. Since durations of irradiations were different,
not all positions were occupied at all times. Due to these changes in conﬁguration and the slightly different position
with respect to the source, the dose in individual crystals is slightly different.

As in the case of proton irradiated crystals, we again determine the transmission along the long axis of the crystal,
and therefore we are interested in the dose along the centre. Fig. 6 shows the simulated transverse dose rate proﬁles,
which exhibit a pronounced U-shape, caused by turning the crystal half-way through the irradiation. The fairly ﬂat
central part, of about
5 mm width, ﬁts very well the width of the light beam in the LT-measurements. In the other
dimension the proﬁle is ﬂat.

6 Fluence and dose determination

6.1 Proton ﬂuence determination in IRRAD1

24 mm2
The ﬂuence, Φp, of the incident proton beam was determined with aluminium foils, cut to a size of 24
and placed in front of the crystals at a distance of about 10 mm. Secondaries produced by the crystals, neutrons
in particular, inﬂuence this measurement. Therefore we preferred to use the isotope 22Na instead of the more
standard 24Na. The determined ﬂuence, in particular its relation to the star density within the crystal, is sensitive
to the geometry and alignment. A further factor to be taken into account came from a change of beam momentum
from the initial 20 GeV/c to 24 GeV/c. Therefore we paid great attention to a careful ﬂuence analysis and cross
checks with the induced radioactivity in the crystal itself. The technical aspects of this and all effects considered,
together with the correction factors derived by us, are detailed in appendix B.

×

Table 3 summarises the proton ﬂuences and gives the dose rates and total doses averaged along the axis of the
crystal. The ﬁrst column, Φp(22Na), gives the ﬂuence value obtained from the aluminium foils but corrected by
the factor of 0.89 in order to account for activation by secondaries. The
Φp-column gives the integral of all

The dose values given in Table 3 correspond to an average along the axis of the crystal, i.e. along the path of light
in the LT measurements. Averaging was done over the dimensions of the light beam. It can be seen from Fig. 3
30% above
that in the proton irradiations the maximum dose rate, at a depth of about 10 cm within the crystal, is
this average.

∼

One issue which will be discussed in detail in appendix C is the uniformity of the beam spot across the crystal
face. These effects, however, remained small enough to require no corrections. Actually, as shown in appendix C,
the simulated effects of non-uniform irradiation agree nicely with measured variations of ˙Dind and LT close to the
edges of the crystal.

6.2 Dose determination at the γ-facility

Alanine dosimeters provide a well-established method to determine cumulative ionising doses. The absolute cali-
bration is usually done with a standard 60Co source and converted to give the dose in air. Ten alanine dosimeters
which accompanied the irradiations provided a crucial cross-check of our dose simulations. Six of these dosimeters
were ﬁxed on the “front” of each of the crystals u–z, i.e. the side facing the source, while two were on the “back”
of crystals v and y. When turning the crystals, “front” and “back” got inverted so that each of these eight alanines
was averaging equally over the “front” and “back” of a crystal. A further two dosimeters were ﬁxed on the source
side of the styropor boxes housing crystals v and y. These dosimeters were removed when the boxes were turned
after the ﬁrst 23 hours of exposure. All 10 alanines were included in the simulations and the dose in them was
recorded. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the doses determined from the alanines and the simulated values.
While the low doses of the 1 h and 8.3 h irradiations are in prefect agreement, alanines exposed for the longest
times indicate a lower value than the simulations. Due to the symmetry of the simulated setup – essentially the
same result was just rescaled with time – it is inconceivable that the simulation would fail for higher doses. The
response of alanine is usually quoted to be linear up to about 100 kGy. However, when approaching the upper
limit, saturation sets in gradually. Although saturation is taken into account in the calibration [24], an explanation

for the difference observed could still be if saturation depends also on the photon energy spectrum, which is softer
in the presence of the crystal than for a plain 60Co calibration source.

Table 4 summarises the doses and dose rates reached in the γ-irradiations. These values have been extracted
directly from the simulation described in section 5.2 but their accuracy has been experimentally veriﬁed by the
comparison with the alanine data, shown in Fig. 8. The dose rate at one end was about 10% higher than the average
and dropped to 20% below average at the other end of the crystals, as can be seen in Fig. 7.

variation. This agrees well with the variation of the µγstd
IND(420) values in Table 1. No signiﬁcant correlation of this
kind is seen in the proton-irradiated crystals.

where trec is the time elapsed since the irradiation. Attempts to ﬁt Eq. 3 for each crystal, with all 5 parameters free,
revealed that the longer time constant (τ2) was comparable to, or larger than, trec and thus the correlation between
the second term and the constant was too strong to allow for a reliable ﬁt. It is, however, reasonable to assume that
the damage corresponds to the same color centres, each of which corresponds to a unique time constant. Under
this assumption we ﬁtted the τi for all crystals simultaneously and, with these ﬁxed, the amplitudes Ai for each
crystal separately. This process was iterative, i.e. τi and Ai were ﬁtted repeatedly with increasingly better initial
guesses until convergence was reached. The quality of the ﬁts, in terms of χ2, was comparable to that obtained by
the 5-parameter ﬁt of Eq. 3 for each crystal separately.

Figs. 11 and 12 show the ﬁts for proton and γ-irradiated crystals, respectively. In comparison to the observed
recovery time constants, crystals a, a’ and F were re-irradiated too soon and therefore do not allow to obtain
reasonable ﬁts.

Of the proton irradiated crystals, d was annealed 240 days after irradiation, thus we have no longer-term room
temperature recovery data for it. While essentially no recovery of crystal d was observed at 160 oC, partial recovery
took place at 250 oC. This temperature was sufﬁcient to restore the pre-irradiation transmission at λ >400 nm. At
a temperature of 350 oC almost complete recovery was reached, except for a small residual shift of the band-edge.

In the case of crystal G a peculiar step appeared after 250 days, which we traced back to an unintentional exposure
to normal room light from ﬂuorescent tubes for about 60 hours during a long radioactivity measurement. The
existence of such light-induced annealing was qualitatively veriﬁed by exposing to the same room lights a crystal

time constants are shown in Fig. 13. The amplitude corresponding to τ1 is slightly increasing with dose in the
case of proton irradiation while it decreases as a function of γ-dose. This decrease could be due to the longer-
lived defects, which build up and contribute to light attenuation, making A1 relatively less effective. Since τ2 was
ﬁtted to a value of 650 days, which is longer than the period of the recovery follow-up, the amplitudes A2 and A3
could not be reliably resolved from each other. This was particularly true for all γ-irradiated crystals and proton
200 days. However, the sum of A2 + A3 for
irradiated crystals d and G, where recovery data extends only to trec ∼
the proton irradiated crystals increases linearly with ﬂuence, while it is consistent with a constant for γ-irradiated
crystals.

All ﬁts – re-normalised to the same values at trec=60 days – are shown in Fig. 14. Re-normalisation at 60 days
was chosen such that the τ1-component of damage has practically disappeared. Thus the left side of the re-
normalisation point shows the relative amplitude of the damage corresponding to τ1, while the right side provides
a visual comparison of the magnitude of the long-term damage. Especially in terms of the short component the
1012 cm−2 (or
crystals group according to the integral ﬂuence or dose they received. Those exposed to
1 kGy) recover, in relative terms, more than those irradiated to higher ﬂuence. While a slight difference between
∼
proton- and γ-irradiated crystals can be seen in the magnitude of the fast component, the long term recovery
appears to be independent of the radiation type.

Figure 15 shows µIND(420) as a function of ﬂuence 150 days after irradiation as calculated from Eq. 3 using the
parameter values shown in Fig 13.

For crystals irradiated several times, the cumulative ﬂuence
Φp has been used and µIND(420) has been nor-
malised to the transmission before the ﬁrst irradiation. We have ﬁtted the data, which cover two orders of mag-
nitude, on a log-log scale and obtain an exponent that corresponds to only 1% deviation from linearity per order
of magnitude in ﬂuence. In particular, if the data in Fig. 15 are compared with Table 1, no correlation between
proton-induced damage and µγstd

IND(420) can be observed.

P

Fig. 16 conﬁrms that even at a dose rate as high as 1 kGy/h the γ-damage saturates. After 1 hour at 1 kGy/h,
µIND(420) has not yet reached its plateau value, but between 8.3 and 46 hours the differences observed can be
entirely attributed to crystal-to-crystal variation. This becomes particularly clear when we normalise µIND(420),

Figure 16: Values of µIND(420) measured on the 7 γ-irradiated crystals after 20 days recovery at room temperature.
The upper plot shows the measured data and the lower one the ratio to the µγstd
as measured by us, with the µγstd
IND(420)-values from Table 1, which is supposed to cancel any crystal-to-crystal
variation. It should be noted, however, that the µγstd
IND(420) values are obtained only about 1 hour after irradiation,
i.e. before short-term recovery is completed. In fact, it has been observed that about 60% of the damage con-
tributing to µγstd
IND(420) recovers during the ﬁrst 20 days while the rest is much more stable [16]. If this is taken
into account in the µIND(420)/µγstd
IND(420) ratio of Fig. 16, the 1 h points are nearly consistent with unity while the
ratios for longer irradiations get pushed to a value of about 3. This large ratio is at least partly – maybe even mostly
– due to the fact that the pre-characterisation irradiations did not last long enough to saturate all color centres.

IND(420)-values from Table 1.

Crystal t shows slightly higher µIND(420) values than the other 6 crystals in Fig. 16. The deviation is even more
pronounced in the µIND(420)/µγstd
IND(420) ratio. These differences might well be, because t is from the earlier set
of 12 crystals received for the proton tests. These had undergone a different pre-characterisation procedure almost
a year earlier. While the 10% difference in µγstd
IND(420), due to the different dose rate, has been taken into account,
there could still be other systematic or procedural effects that might have led to a slightly lower µγstd
IND(420) of
crystal t.

When comparing the data of Figs. 15 and 16, it should be taken into account that the proton irradiated crystals
IND(420) < 1 m−1 and most of them should be compared with the solid symbols in the upper plot of
all had µγstd
Fig. 16. In particular, as can be seen from Table 1, crystal a” was characterised as having the same, excellent,
radiation hardness as crystal v. After exposure to comparable integral doses, the proton irradiated crystal a” shows
an induced absorption of 15 m−1 while the γ-irradiated crystal v has saturated at a value of only 0.3 m−1.

The shape of the LT curves, in particular the shift of the band-edge after proton exposure and the fact that two
universal time constants ﬁt the data well but give very different dose-dependence for the amplitudes in Eq. 3, leads
us to the following interpretation:

scattering from small centres of severe damage.

•

•

The damage corresponding to the two τi values is produced by proton and γ-irradiation in the same way and
results in the same recovery-characteristics. Most likely this damage corresponds to the same color centres.

The band-edge shift is unique to proton irradiation and corresponds to a different damage mechanism. This
damage appears to be stable and cumulative, at least over the

Φp range explored.

P

A similar band-edge shift has been observed earlier in proton-irradiated BGO-crystals [26] while no such shift was
created by γ-exposure. A later re-analysis of the data in [26] revealed that the proton induced damage is cumulative
also in BGO [27].

The amplitudes A1 and A2 exhibit some dependence on proton ﬂuence, which is not perfectly consistent with the
above assumption. It is conceivable, however, that other defect centres, speciﬁc to protons, play some role and
have time constants that could not be resolved from our two universal τi values and the constant term.

The assumption that the highly ionising fragments, produced by inelastic hadronic interactions, would be respon-
sible for the observed speciﬁc proton damage implies that there might be very small regions of severe damage
distributed within the crystal. Fig. 17 shows µIND(λ), plotted as a function of the wavelength. Above
420 nm
the dependency for heavily proton-damaged crystals goes like λ−4, which is exactly what would result if the at-
tenuation was entirely due to Rayleigh-scattering. In γ-damaged crystals no such linear dependence appears and
only a structure due to absorption band formation is seen. The signiﬁcant crystal-to-crystal variation of γ-damage
is again evident. The µγstd
IND(420) values in Table 1 suggest that the proton-damaged crystals should rather be
compared with the less damaged γ-irradiated crystals u, w and v. For proton damaged crystals, the λ−4 slope of
Rayleigh-scattering is clearly superimposed on top of the absorption-band structure from pure ionisation damage.
This provides ﬁrm evidence that the speciﬁc proton damage is of a very different nature than what can be caused by
purely ionising radiation. At ﬂuences of the order of 1012 cm−2 and below, the λ−4 slope starts to get submerged
in the absorption band structure which means that at low ﬂuences it would be difﬁcult to distinguish the speciﬁc
proton damage.
The µIND(λ) slope starts to deviate strongly from the λ−4 behaviour at wavelengths below 420 nm where the crys-
tals become strongly absorptive. The Rayleigh scattering formalism is known to break down when the dimensions
of the scattering centres become larger than
10% of the wavelength. This means that the created defect centres
must have dimensions

0.4 µm.

The fact that proton damage seems to be connected to very small, highly damaged, regions strongly points in the
direction that the origin is indeed in the heavily ionising fragments created in inelastic hadronic interactions. In this

case, the overall dose rate of the irradiations should not be signiﬁcant, since the local instantaneous ionisation of
the fragment is overwhelmingly large. Although the PS beam did not allow to lower the intensity in order to obtain
ﬁrm experimental proof for this, all evidence supports the assumption that the proton damage will be cumulative
irrespective of the dose rate.

advantage of a homogeneous calorimeter, namely a very low stochastic term in the energy resolution, the constant
term must be kept low as well. This can be achieved only by accurate calibration and permanent monitoring of the
crystals. Radiation damage, not compensated by monitoring, would quickly degrade the calorimeter performance.
Therefore, the LT of each crystal will be calibrated with a 440 nm laser. In addition Z

events can be used for in-situ calibration. However, if the transparency of the crystals decreases, this will ultimately
affect the photostatistics and thereby increase the stochastic term in an unrecoverable way.

In Fig. 18 we compare the simulated star densities at various η-values in the EE and along the centre of a crystal

protons would correspond to the star density expected at η
2.2 over 10 years LHC operation. However, the
characteristics of stars change with energy. While in our beam test a majority of stars are generated by high-
energy protons, in the EE they are predominantly due to pion and neutron interactions at energies rarely exceeding
1 GeV. At low energy typically a few nucleons are emitted and one heavy slow recoil is produced. With increasing
energy, the multiplicity of secondary particles increases and the mean atomic mass of the heavy nuclear fragment
decreases, while its energy increases slowly. Energies of ﬁssion fragments are fairly constant but the cross section
is energy-dependent. These effects can be taken into account only by a detailed simulation of the hadron-nucleus
events followed by transport of the fragments down to zero energy. However, prior to such a simulation, it has to

be decided which is the physical process causing the damage.

We have argued that stars are likely to be at the origin of the speciﬁc proton damage and our experimental results
– especially the consistency with Rayleigh scattering – seem to support this. However, our irradiation data do not
tell us by what mechanism the stars cause the observed damage. In high-resistivity silicon the hadron damage is
known to be due to the created impurities and, especially, lattice defects [28]. However, since the natural impurity
concentrations in PbWO4 are much higher, a similar damage mechanism cannot be assumed without a quantitative
consideration. From Fig. 3 we deduce an average of 0.14 stars/cm3 per unit of ﬂux. Thus, for Φp = 1013 cm−2
10−11 per atom. This is far lower than the natural density of
we obtain an impurity concentration of about 3
imperfections in the crystal, which is at the 10−6 level.

×

However, along their path, the recoils collide elastically with atoms of the lattice and kick these out from their
position. Most of the displacements heal immediately, but some remain stable or metastable. Simulation methods
of fragment transport have been developed for studies of Single Event Upsets in silicon based electronics chips [29].
Thereafter they have been successfully applied to bulk damage studies of silicon detectors [28]. Silicon, in contrast
to PbWO 4, is a well known material from this point of view. Thus the adaption of the simulation to the crystals
introduced several uncertainties.
In particular, the displacement energy, about 20 eV in silicon, is not known
for PbWO 4. While it is likely to be higher, it is unlikely to be much different from the silicon value. For our
simulations we assume a value of 50 eV. The simulations proceed as described in [28, 29] and give on average
2700 displaced atoms per 20 GeV/c proton. Counting both the vacancies and the interstitials as defects, the number
doubles. However, at least 90% of the vacancy-interstitial pairs will recombine immediately, so a reasonable
10−8 for the
assumption for the number of defects created per proton is <500. This gives an upper limit of
defect concentration per lattice atom, which still remains about two orders of magnitude below the natural impurity
levels.

∼

A more plausible damage mechanism seems to be that the created nuclear fragments cause extremely high local
ionisation densities along the short path which they cover in the crystal. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that a lead
105 MeV/cm, which is 50000 times larger than for a minimum ionising
ion can reach a maximum dE/dx of 5

collisions. The most energetic fragments are due to high-energy induced ﬁssion of W and Pb and typically have
energies of 100 MeV or just below. Zr and Fe, shown in Fig. 1, are good examples of possible ﬁssion products.

are responsible for speciﬁc hadron damage, then the main question is what is the critical value (dE/dx)crit needed
to create a stable damage centre. If such a value can be identiﬁed, then the amount of damage is quite likely
to scale with the total tracklength of fragments exceeding (dE/dx) crit. This tracklength is shown in Fig. 19 for
(dE/dx)crit values above 100 MeV/cm. The tracklengths are normalized per star, which allows a direct comparison
of the reactions induced by 20 GeV/c protons and those expected in the CMS EE, for which an average spectrum
between η=1.9–2.8 has been used in the simulation. In order to be insensitive to the non-uniformity close to the
5 mm around the centre line of the crystal, which corresponds
crystal edges, the tracklengths were recorded only
to the region mapped in the LT measurements.

±

The difference in tracklength between the 20 GeV/c proton induced events and those created by the EE spectrum
shows only a weak dependence on (dE/dx) crit and amounts on average to a factor of 4. At (dE/dx) crit be-
low 1 GeV/cm, the tracklength is mostly due to slow protons. For these it should be noted that the simulations
consider only protons produced by the stars. Especially in the CMS EE, but to some extent also in our beam
test, protons produced elsewhere can enter the crystal and produce a highly ionising track upon stopping2). For
(dE/dx) crit >1 GeV, heavier fragments dominate because, as shown in Fig. 1, the dE/dx of a proton can never
exceed 1.5 GeV/cm. It should be pointed out that the results of Fig. 19 are not sensitive to our assumption of 50 eV
as the displacement threshold. That parameter affects only the total number of produced lattice defects, but not the
highly ionising tracks.

With the provision that these simulations are based on an unproven assumption of the mechanism causing the
speciﬁc hadron damage, Fig. 19 predicts that stars produced by our beam test are on average a factor of 4 more
damaging than those expected in the EE. With 20 GeV/c protons the speciﬁc hadron damage becomes dominant at
2 m−1. Taking the factor of 4 into account but assuming that the damage
is stable over time, this would correspond to roughly η=2.6 after an integrated LHC luminosity of 500 fb−1. If this
P
extrapolation is correct, the performance of the high-resolution region of the ECAL will not be compromised by
hadron damage during the ﬁrst 10 years of LHC operation.

9 Conclusions

We have performed an extensive irradiation campaign, aimed at verifying the possible existence of speciﬁc, hadron-
induced damage in PbWO4 crystals. Emphasis has been put on a careful analysis and detailed understanding of
the irradiation conditions and a long follow-up of damage recovery.

The very intense radiation environment would have damaged any front-end electronics or other sensitive equip-
ment, making a determination of damage on the crystal itself complicated if an in situ determination of LT had been
attempted. To avoid such ambiguities we put our emphasis on a simple procedure aimed solely at the determination
of long-term damage. Due to the high rates which we were forced to use in order to reach 10-year equivalent LHC
ﬂuences, any determination of short term damage would not have been relevant for LHC conditions, anyway.

Since no γ-irradiation data of recent CMS crystals existed at dose rates corresponding to those caused by the proton
beam, we made comparative irradiations at an intense 60Co facility.
Only at proton ﬂuences well beyond 1012 cm−2, i.e. doses much higher than 1 kGy, we start to observe clear differ-
ences in the LT-characteristics of crystals exposed to protons and those exposed to photons. The main differences
are

1. The proton induced damage increases linearly with ﬂuence while the γ-damage saturates after a few hours

of exposure at 1 kGy/h.

2. No correlation is seen between the µγstd

IND(420), from the radiation hardness pre-characterisation with 60Co
photons, and the proton induced µIND(420). In the case of our γ-irradiated crystals this correlation is nearly
perfect.

3. In proton-irradiated crystals, the band-edge shifts towards longer wavelengths and µIND(λ)

λ−4, while
the band-edge remains stable in the γ-irradiated crystals and a clear absorption-band structure appears in
µIND(λ).

It was not possible to raise the γ-intensity beyond 1 kGy/h, in order to obtain a comparison with our highest proton
beam intensities. It is usually claimed that the saturation level of γ-damage increases with dose rate. For protons,
however, we observe no difference between rates of 1012 cm−2h−1 and 1013 cm−2h−1.

A thorough exploration of ﬁtting various functions to the recovery data showed, that Eq. 3 is suitable to ﬁt all data
accumulated so far. In particular we discovered that the quality of the ﬁts does not suffer, if the time constants,
τi, are universal with values of 17.2 days and 650 days. Only the absolute amount of damage is very different for
the two radiation types, which is reﬂected in a different dose dependence for the ﬁtted amplitudes Ai, as shown in
Fig. 13.

Our results provide strong evidence that proton exposure of PbWO4 crystals causes damage that cannot be repro-
duced with γ-irradiation. This damage seems to be independent of rate and increases linearly with accumulated
ﬂuence. We strongly emphasise that the difference we observe starts to manifest itself only at proton ﬂuences well
beyond 1012 cm−2. Below this ﬂuence the “normal” γ-like damage, due to minimum ionising tracks, is dominating
to such an extent that it is probably impossible to experimentally see any difference between protons and photons.

The observation, that µIND(λ) of proton damaged crystals is consistent with Rayleigh scattering from objects
much smaller than 0.4 µm, supports our assumption that the speciﬁc proton damage is due to the very dense local
ionisation of fragments created in inelastic nuclear collisions. In this case it is likely that the 20 GeV/c proton beam
used in our tests is somewhat too pessimistic with respect to the hadron spectrum expected in the CMS ECAL.
Our simulations indicate that the damage ratio between 20 GeV/c protons and the CMS ECAL hadron spectrum,
per unit star density, might be about a factor of 4. But this remains to be veriﬁed by further irradiations with
low-energy pions, which provide a better representation of the ECAL conditions.

A Induced radioactivity
The creation of nuclear fragments during hadron irradiation causes the crystals to become radioactive. Since
PbWO4 includes the heavy elements W and Pb, the 20 GeV/c proton beam is able to produce a huge number of
different nuclides. Most of these are either stable or short-lived, but a fraction of them have long half-life and
are responsible for the remnant radioactivity of the irradiated crystals. According to simulations, there are about
1800 different nuclide species with an activity above 1 Bq/cm3 at the end of an exposure to 1013 p/cm2. Even after
50 days of cooling, 150 nuclides remain above this activity threshold.

The predictive simulation of crystal radioactivation proceeded in three steps. First, during the full FLUKA simula-
tion described before, all residual nuclides produced in the crystal were recorded. This stage relies on the accuracy
of the FLUKA models to describe the hadron-nucleus interaction in full detail. Earlier dedicated work has shown,
that an accuracy better than a factor of 2 can be expected for heavy materials [30, 31]. In a second stage the evo-
lution over time of the produced nuclide inventory was calculated with the DeTra code [32]. This calculation is
analytical and thus exact within the limits of accuracy given by the available nuclear data ﬁles. DeTra produces
a table of all nuclide activities as a function of cooling time. For the ﬁnal phase of the simulation these activities
were converted into an emitted γ-spectrum which was then used to calculate ˙Dind at our measurement point by
integrating over the entire crystal and weighting with the simulated star density within the crystal. The integration
was performed via a detailed photon transport with FLUKA.
Figure 20 compares simulated ˙Dind and all our measurements. For this purpose all measurements have been

In the small insert of Fig. 20 the doses from individual crystals are compared with the calculated ˙Dind. We observe
a systematic underestimate in the simulation. On average the deviation amounts to 29% and even at worst the dis-
agreement remains below a factor of 2, which still can be considered a very good agreement for such a prediction.
We also have to recall two uncertainties in the measured values with respect to the simulation, namely the unknown
efﬁciency of the Automess 6150AD6 above 1.3 MeV, which we probably underestimate, and a slight uncertainty
in the size and position of the sensitive element within the device.

Φp matters, not the rate. Thus a rescaling by

The most reliable standard way to determine the ﬂuence of the incident proton beam (Φp) is by means of aluminium

However, the cross section Al(n,α)24Na above
20 GeV (8.7 mb). Since the crystal produces a large ﬂux of neutrons above this threshold energy, 24Na is not a
useful isotope to monitor Φp, on top of the fact that its 15 h half-life makes it impractical for our purpose. A more
suitable isotope is 22Na. Due to its long half-life it integrates the ﬂuence, and is insensitive to short-term beam
ﬂuctuations.

a signiﬁcant spread but allow us to estimate 11.2
of a crystal, gave 10.4 mb. Since this is based on the much better known production cross section of 24Na, we use
10.4 mb for the ﬂuence analysis. However, we have to point out that even without a crystal, backscattered radiation
in IRRAD1 increases the production of 24Na more than of 22Na. Thus the 10.4 mb is likely to represent a lower
bound. Consequently, Φp is likely to be rather over- than underestimated.

±

∼

While certainly smaller than for Al(n,α)24Na, the cross sections for Al(n,X)22Na are not known well enough to
allow for an accurate analysis of the neutron contribution. With our best knowledge of the cross sections we obtain
from the FLUKA simulation a 11% contribution to the 22Na activity from non-beam particles. This we propagate
into our estimate of the incident proton ﬂuence.

The aluminium foils were cut to a size of 24
sions. Thus the foils were averaging the whole ﬂuence incident on the crystal. In a single crystal, however, protons
close to an edge contribute on average less star density, thus damage and activation, because a larger fraction of the
hadronic cascade escapes, when compared to centrally impinging ones. In fact, the leakage of the cascade causes
that the radiation intensity drops towards the edges even with a uniform beam, for which the star density in the
centre is about 17% higher than the average over the whole crystal. However, would the crystal be surrounded by

other crystals, also covered by the beam, then these would compensate for the leakage and the proﬁle would be ﬂat
and the total star density higher. Thus the relation between Φp, determined with the aluminium foil, and the star
density depends – in addition to the beam characteristics – also on the size and surroundings of the crystal.

The activation of the crystal by inelastic nuclear interactions is roughly proportional to the star density inside the
crystal. Unfortunately, this does not provide an absolute determination of Φp, because star density and ˙Dind can
be related to each other only through simulations, which introduce too large an uncertainty, as discussed in detail
in appendix A. However, since for all our irradiations the conditions within the crystals are the same, the effects
of simulations cancel out if we consider only the relative differences between irradiations. Thus we expect a near
to perfect correlation between ˙Dind and the 22Na activity of the aluminium foils. The only deviations could arise
from signiﬁcant non-uniformities of the beam spot or from a severe misalignment of the crystal during irradiation
and, to a lesser extent, from the decay corrections, for which recourse to simulation is unavoidable. This correlation
between Φp and ˙Dind, shown in Fig. 21, provided a very valuable cross-check of our ﬂuence measurements. The
˙Dind measurements were taken at different times, but all values have been corrected to 50 days after irradiation
using the simulated decay of radioactivity in the crystals. As expected, the correlation is almost perfect, indicating
that the activation foils give reliable and consistent ﬂuence values. There are no signs of severe anomalies in any
individual irradiation.

Due to a faulty magnet in the PS, the early irradiations took place with a 20 GeV/c proton beam while later
exposures (crystals a” and h) were performed at 24 GeV/c. The energy dependence of the Al(p,X)Na22 cross
section is negligible in this regime. However, as shown in Fig. 3, the 20% increase in proton momentum leads
to more intense showering and thus to a higher radiation ﬁeld within the crystal. The effect is very similar for all
hadronic radiation quantities plotted in Fig. 3 but we use the 8.6% increase in star density, averaged over the crystal
length. The LT measurements also average along the whole crystal and thus justify a simple correction by simply
rescaling Φp, as determined from the aluminium foils, by a factor of 1.086 for the two crystals irradiated with
24 GeV/c protons. In the case of ionising dose the effect is larger because the electromagnetic cascade is much
better contained even in a single crystal.

from one side of the crystal to the other5). Crystal E was identiﬁed as having received the most non-uniform
exposure. We adjusted the slope such that the ˙Dind values measured on E were roughly reproduced and ended
up with a factor of 5 intensity difference across the crystal front face. A full FLUKA simulation was done with
such a severe non-uniformity. Fig. 22 compares the lateral proﬁles of star density obtained from this simulation
and the normal uniform one. Although a larger fraction of beam hits close to the edge, the total number of stars
differs only by a few percent. Due to cascading, the variation in star density is much smaller than the factor of 5
used as incident beam intensity. We also observe that in the centre of the crystal the effects of non-uniformity are
at a minimum, which suggests that, provided the crystal alignment is the same in all LT measurements, even for
the most severe beam non-uniformity encountered the inﬂuence on the results remains negligible in comparison to
other uncertainties.

The factor of 5 beam intensity difference used in the simulations of a non-uniform beam, as described before, was
adjusted so that the relative6) variation of ˙Dind observed on the most non-uniform crystal, E, was reproduced when
the simulated data were used to calculate ˙Dind on each side.

The same simulated data were also used to integrate the star density along the light paths of the LT measurements.
Assuming that stars cause the damage, the ﬁt of Fig. 15 allows to translate these star densities into µIND(420)
values, which can be compared with the measured values on absolute scale.
Figure 23 shows such comparisons for ˙Dind and µIND(420) in the case of crystal E. The systematic underestimate
of ˙Dind is consistent with Fig. 20, where the simulated ˙Dind-values for crystal E are also slightly lower than the
measurements. However, it must be emphasised that for such a simulation an agreement better than a factor of
two, is remarkable.

The simulated µIND(420) values are in perfect agreement with measurements, except for a slight up-down asym-
metry. This is most probably related to a beam non-uniformity in the vertical direction, while the simulated beam
intensity was varied only horizontally.

5) A determination of the beam proﬁle using OSL (Optically Stimulated Luminescence) ﬁlms showed that the real non-

uniformities are not linear but exhibit a bump-like maximum on one side.
Φp is always derived from the aluminium foils.

In relative terms, the non-uniformities in both µIND(420) and ˙Dind are very well reproduced by just considering
the spatial variation of star density within the crystal.

Acknowledgements
The proton irradiations, performed at CERN, were made possible only by the efforts of R. Steerenberg, who
provided us with the required PS beam conditions. The help of M. Glaser and F. Ravotti in operating the irradiation
and dosimetry facilities is gratefully acknowledged. The support and practical help of S. Baccaro and A. Cecilia
during the γ-irradiations at ENEA-Casaccia was essential and is gratefully acknowledged, as is the contribution of
E. Auffray who provided us with the crystals after having characterised their γ-radiation hardness at the Geneva
Hospital.

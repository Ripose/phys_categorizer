Abstract

A new kind of positron sources for future linear colliders, where the converter is an
aligned tungsten crystal, oriented on the h111i axis, has been studied at CERN in
the WA103 experiment with tertiary electron beams from the SPS. In such sources
the photons resulting from channeling radiation and coherent bremsstrahlung create
the e+e− pairs.

Electron beams, of 6 and 10 GeV, were impinging on diﬀerent kinds of targets:
a 4 mm thick crystal, a 8 mm thick crystal and a compound target made of 4
mm crystal followed by 4 mm amorphous disk. An amorphous tungsten target 20
mm thick was also used for the sake of comparison with the 8 mm crystal and to
check the ability of the detection system to provide the correct track reconstruction.
The charged particles coming out from the target were detected in a drift chamber
immersed partially in a magnetic ﬁeld. The reconstruction of the particle trajectories
provided the energy and angular spectrum of the positrons in a rather wide energy
range (up to 150 MeV) and angular domain (up to 30 degrees). The experimental

approach presented in this article provides a full description of this kind of source. A
presentation of the measured positron distribution in momentum space (longitudinal
versus transverse) is given to allow an easy determination of the available yield for
a given momentum acceptance. Results on photons, measured downstream of the
positron detector, are also presented. A signiﬁcant enhancement of photon and
positron production is clearly observed. This enhancement, for a 10 GeV incident
beam, is of 4 for the 4 mm thick crystal and larger than 2 for the 8 mm thick
crystal. Another important result concerns the validation of the simulations for the
crystals, for which a quite good agreement was met between the simulations and
the experiment, for positrons as well as for photons. These results are presented
after a short presentation of the experimental setup and of the track reconstruction
procedure.

1 Introduction

Linear electron-positron colliders will be the privileged tool for studying physics
in the TeV energy region. To overcome the decrease of the e+e− annihilation
cross section, very large currents both in e− and in e+ will be needed. The con-
ventional positron source consists in an amorphous target of heavy metal, hit
by a primary electron beam. Photons, which are produced by bremsstrahlung,
are converted in the same target into e+e− pairs resulting in an electromag-
netic shower. The thickness of the target is chosen to maximize the number
of the positrons in the energy and angular domain of acceptance of the down-
stream matching system installed before the damping ring. Such positrons
represent only a small fraction of all charged particles created in the target.
This is due to their wide energy and angular spread, which comes from the
photon emission and pair production processes and, above all, from multiple
scattering of charged particles. Therefore a very intense primary electron beam
is needed to achieve the desired positron beam current.

In the high energy region, the basic processes involved in the shower devel-
opment are considerably enhanced in the oriented crystals, as compared with

corresponding amorphous media. The most pronounced eﬀects take place at
the orientation where the electrons are incident along the major axes of the
crystal. At such orientation, the incident electrons are exposed to the highest
mean electric ﬁeld provided by the atomic rows [1]. The enhancement depends
on the particle energy and the crystal orientation (see [2] for further details
concerning electromagnetic processes in crystals). Therefore, the replacement
of the conventional positron target by a crystal is expected to improve the
eﬃciency of the positron source.

When the energy increases, the coherent (crystal) eﬀects become noticeable
ﬁrst in radiation, while their contribution to the pair production is still neg-
ligible. For example, the radiation intensity caused by the electric ﬁeld of
the < 111 >-axis of a tungsten crystal exceeds that of the conventional
bremsstrahlung starting with electron energies ε ∼ 1 GeV [1]. For the same
crystal, the coherent contribution to the pair production starts to exceed that
of the standard (Bethe-Heitler) mechanism at photon energies ω ∼ 22 GeV.
For lighter crystals, the corresponding value of ω turns out to be several times
larger than for tungsten. An incident electron energy of several GeV is foreseen
for an eﬃcient positron source. Then the pair production process proceeds in
a crystal as in the corresponding amorphous medium. The enhancement of
radiation from initial electrons is thereby the main crystal eﬀect in the en-
ergy region of interest. According to theoretical estimates (see, e.g. [1]), the
eﬀective radiation length Lef in a tungsten crystal becomes smaller than the
conventional radiation length by the factor of 4.2 at ε = 4 GeV and by the
factor of 5.7 at ε = 8 GeV. Alongside with the high power, the radiation at
axial alignment is characterized by the softness of its spectrum. This leads
to further increase in the number of emitted photons and in the number of
produced positrons as compared with the amorphous target.

The description of the development of the electron-photon showers in an ax-
ially aligned crystal was elaborated in [3], [4], [5]. According to these papers
(see also Fig. 1 in [6]), the electron energy is converted in a crystal target into
photons over a thickness of several Lef . Then at the depth L0 ≈ (3 ÷ 4)Lef
most of the particles, including the initial electrons, are suﬃciently soft to re-
duce the coherent contribution to the radiation to a level below the incoherent
one. Therefore, the further development of the shower proceeds more or less in
the same way for the crystal or amorphous type of the remaining part of a tar-
get. So, we come to the idea of a compound target, which consists of a crystal
part of thickness about L0 followed by an amorphous one [7]. We emphasize
that the crystal part of a target serves as a radiator, and secondary charged
particles are still not so numerous at this stage of the shower development.
Therefore, only a small portion of the total energy loss is deposited in this
part of the target, which considerably reduces the danger of its overheating.

In the construction of an intense positron source, the thermal issues are rather

3

important. A substantial part (for example, more than 30 % in the JLC
project [8]) of the primary beam power is dissipated and transformed into heat
inside the target, mainly due to the ionization energy losses by the charged
particles of the shower. As already observed in the SLAC Linear Collider
(SLC) target, this causes serious thermal problems, which makes the actual
limitation to the beam current. For crystals, where the ionization energy losses
are practically not modiﬁed as compared with amorphous media, the thermal
issues were considered in [4], [5] and, in detail, in [6]. It was found that, in
the energy range under consideration, the positron yield at the optimal target
thickness may be larger in a crystal case only by several percent. However,
the amount of the energy deposition in a crystal turns out to be considerably
lower (by a factor 2 for the JLC project, for instance) than in an amorphous
target providing the same positron yield, while the Peak Energy Deposition
Density (PEDD) is approximately of the same magnitude in both cases.

Recently the positron production in axially aligned single crystals was studied
in two series of experiments performed at CERN [9] and KEK [10]. In both
cases, the incident electron beam of diﬀerent energies, up to 10 GeV, was
aligned with the < 111 >-axis of a tungsten crystal, which sometimes served
as a crystal part of the compound target containing an additional amorphous
tungsten part. Basing on the approach developed in [4] and [5], theoretical es-
timations were obtained in [11], which display a rather good agreement with
the experimental results of [10], where only the positrons outgoing in the for-
ward direction (i.e., with a vanishing transverse momentum) were registered
for a discrete set of their longitudinal momentum values. However, to obtain
a full description of the crystal-assisted positron source, the positron distri-
bution in the whole momentum space, longitudinal and transverse, should be
measured. This is done in the present experimental studies, where the energy
and angular distributions of the positrons are obtained in a rather wide energy
range (up to 150 MeV) and angular domain (up to 30 degrees).

2 The experimental setup

The experiment was installed on the X5 transfer line of the SPS West Hall at
CERN. It used tertiary electron beams having energies between 5 and 40 GeV.
After passing through trigger counters and proﬁle monitors (delay chambers)
the electrons impinge on the target. Photons and e+e− pairs are generated
in this target. They go mainly in the forward direction and travel across the
magnetic spectrometer made of a magnet (MBPS), with vertical magnetic
ﬁeld, inside which the drift chamber is placed. The drift chamber is completed
by two positron counters, one on the wall away from the beam, one on the
back wall (Fig. 1). The charged particles coming out from the Drift Chamber
close to the forward direction are swept by a second magnet (MBPL) while

4

the forward photons reach the photon detector made of a preshower and a
calorimeter.

2.1 The beam

The SPS beam is made of 3.2 (resp. 5.2) second duration pulses with a 14.4
(resp. 16.8) second period for the 2000 (resp. 2001) summer runs. Each pulse
contains ∼ 104 electrons representing 99 % of the particles. This intensity
value was currently reached at 6 and 10 GeV.

The channeling condition requires that the incident electron angle on the tar-
get be smaller than the Lindhard critical angle [12]; this angle is of 0.45 mrad
at 10 GeV and for the h111i orientation of the tungsten crystal. Taking into
account the persistence of crystal eﬀects at angles larger than the critical an-
gle, the acceptance angle for the trigger was chosen equal to 0.75 mrad. This
selects about 1% of the incident electrons. A trigger system made of scintilla-
tion counters, with a restricted angular aperture of 0.75 mrad, was installed
upstream of the target. The trigger selection was improved oﬀ line by the
informations provided by a proportional delay chamber. This delay chamber
with horizontal and vertical grids, put at short distance from the target, pro-
vided informations on the lateral distributions of the incident electron beam.
These informations served for beam control during the run and, as said above,
were also used in the selection criteria. On Fig. 2 we represent the lateral
distributions of the electron beam.

2.2 The targets

The crystal-assisted positron source can be an all-crystal target. However,
coherent eﬀects are mostly important at the beginning of the shower. In the
following steps of the shower the particles have lower energies, larger angles
and the crystalline eﬀects are not important. Therefore, a compound target,
made of a crystal as a primary radiator generating a large amount of photons
and an amorphous disk where the photons are converted into e+e− pairs, has
nearly the same advantages. In the experiment, four kinds of targets have been
installed on a 0.001 degree precision goniometer:

• a 4 mm thick crystal,
• a 8 mm thick crystal,
• a compound target made of 4 mm crystal followed by a 4 mm thick amor-

phous disk,

• an amorphous disk 20 mm thick; this target was used in order to check the
reconstruction eﬃciency with a number of positrons comparable to the one

5

produced in a 8 mm thick aligned crystal.

Mosaic spreads of the crystals (root mean square disorientation angle of the
crystalline domains) is measured by gamma-diﬀractometry at the Max-Planck
Institute in Stuttgart- are slightly less than 0.5 mrad. The targets alignment
was done using the data from the positron counters and from the photon
preshower. The latter gives a signal proportional to the number of photons,
which is maximum on axis position, as can be seen on the rocking curves
(Fig. 3). The signal in the preshower is formed mainly by the two processes: γ
conversion with the yield of two minimal ionizing particles (MIP) per photon
and Compton scattering with the yield of one MIP per photon. The relative
contributions of the processes depend on the emitted γ spectrum.

2.3 The positron detector

The positron detector consists in the drift chamber (DC) with hexagonal cells
and positron scintillation counters. The DC is a quasi-plane detector with its
largest dimensions in the horizontal plane and the smallest one, in the vertical
plane. It presents two parts:

• the ﬁrst part (DC1), with a cell radius of 0.9 cm, is located mainly outside
the magnetic ﬁeld of the spectrometer. It allows the measurement of the
horizontal exit angle, α of the positrons.

• the second one (DC2), with a cell radius of 1.6 cm, is immersed in the mag-
netic ﬁeld. It allows the measurement of the horizontal positron (electron)
momentum. Two values of the magnetic ﬁeld are used: 1 and 4 kilogauss
(KG), in order to investigate the whole energy region of interest, from 5 to
150 MeV.

In the drift chamber the wires are parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld (vertical). The
available space in the bending magnet (MBPS) restricts the vertical size of
the chamber and therefore, the length of the wires (6 cm). With such short
length, the border eﬀect is signiﬁcant. The drift chamber has metallic walls
therefore these border eﬀects lead to an increase of the gas ampliﬁcation. In
order to use the central part of the wires, two positron counters with a vertical
size of 3 cm were used. That sets the vertical acceptance to ±1.5 degree for a
distance target – counter of about 1 meter. The ﬁrst counter is placed on the
lateral side of the chamber and the other one on the back side. (see Fig. 1).
Low energy positrons are more likely bent toward the side positron counter.
Strictly speaking, for a many-track event, these counters told only that at
least one track was hitting the central part of the wires but did not tell which
one. The signal provided by the side counter gives a rather good indication on
the low-energy positron yield. The signal wires in the drift chamber are made

6

of gold-plated tungsten and the ﬁeld wires of titanium. The drift chamber
has 21 layers. The maximum horizontal angle being accepted is 30 degrees.
The limited vertical size sets the overall acceptance to 6 % of 2π solid angle.
In order to reduce the multiple scattering for low-energy positrons the drift
chamber is ﬁlled with an helium-based mixture He (90 %) + CH4 (10 %).
The achieved coordinate resolution is about 500 micrometers. This leads to
an angular resolution of 0.25 degree and a typical energy resolution of 0.6
MeV for both values of the magnetic ﬁeld. Standard electronics associated
to drift chambers is used. The data acquisition software is developed using
KMAX system under Windows NT environment. The collected data is saved
on a hard disk. The total amount of the raw data is approximately 3 GB.

2.4 The photon detector

The photon multiplicity is rather high: about 200 photons/event for a 8 mm
thick crystal target oriented along its < 111 > axis and 10 GeV initial electron
energy. We measure only the average photon multiplicity and the total radiated
energy, contained in a forward cone with maximum half angle of 4 mrad. For
this goal the photon detector is made of:

• a preshower made of a copper disk (0.2X0 thick), followed by a scintilla-
tor. Two sizes of copper disks (3 and 6 cm in diameter, corresponding to a
semi-angle aperture of 1.5 and 3 mrad respectively) have been used succes-
sively to look at the number of photons and at their angular distribution.
The preshower gives information on the average photon multiplicity. As the
number of photons varies more sharply than the radiated energy with re-
spect to the crystal orientation, the preshower signal is used for the crystal
alignment.

• a ”spaghetti” calorimeter with thin scintillation ﬁbers, giving the amount
of radiated energy (see [13]). The preshower is in close contact with the
”spaghetti” calorimeter.

3 Analysis

3.1 The reconstruction procedure

The track reconstruction was done with the histogram method, modiﬁed to
assign 3 parameters to each track. To avoid diﬃculties coming from the high
rate of occupancy and complications from the non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld in
the ﬁrst part of the drift chamber, the reconstructed trajectory was based on

trajectory of an electron or positron, projected on the horizontal plane, was
parametrised as a circle with the following parameters: r is the radius of the
circle; (xc, zc) are the coordinates of the circle center. To determine the track
parameters, a minimum of 3 hits must be detected. Each hit may be repre-
sented by a small circle centered on the hit wire and the radius of which is
proportional to the drift time. If n hits were detected in the drift chamber, the
number of all possible tracks based on 3 hits each is N = 8n!
3!(n−3)! , according
to combinatorial analysis. The factor 8 comes from the two possible contact
points between the track and the small hit circle, this choice being repeated 3
times. For example for the 20 mm target and 10 GeV incident electron the typ-
ical number of hits is near 50 and the typical number of reconstructed tracks
is 4 – 5. All these tracks parameters are collected in three 2D-histograms:

will give approximately the same values of parameters and hence will produce
a peak on the histograms. The histogram peak position serve as a parameter
seed for the ﬁtting procedure. The candidate with maximal number of hits
is selected and all the hits belonging to this candidate are removed from the
further consideration. After that, the next track is chosen with the same pro-
cedure and this procedure is repeated as long as at least one candidate with 4
hits exists. For each track found the optimal set of parameters is calculated:
the charge Q, the horizontal momentum ph = qp2
z and the horizontal
angle α = arctan (px/pz) with respect to the beam axis.

3.2 Reconstruction eﬃciency

We deﬁne a reconstruction eﬃciency η(p, θ) as:

η(p, θ) =

N sim
r
N sim
in

,

(1)

r

is the number of reconstructed tracks, N sim

where N sim
in , the number of positrons
passing through the chamber, i.e., crossing a minimum number of cells and
where ph is taken for p and α for the θ due to the ﬂatness of the drift chamber.
This eﬃciency is determined by the simulations. It has been calculated with
GEANT code [14]. For the case with high occupancy (20mm amorphous target
and 10 GeV incident electron beam) it reaches 80% at large angles. However
for the tracks with angles α < 7 degrees (usually high positron momenta),
this eﬃciency is reduced to 50 % due to the high occupancy. An example of

GeV. The crosses are the drift chamber wires. Circles around the crosses represent
the measured distance between tracks and wires. Lines are the reconstructed electron

the reconstructed tracks, per one event, is given in ﬁgure 4. The yield, as
reported in the results, is deﬁned as:

Y IELD(p, θ) =

N exp
r
η(p, θ) · A(p, θ)

,

(2)

r

where N exp
is the number of measured positrons given by reconstruction,
A(p, θ), the acceptance of the Drift Chamber in the horizontal and vertical
planes. The acceptance is also derived from the simulations.

Among the reconstructed tracks only a part can be considered as “good tracks”
corresponding to a proper evaluation of the positron momentum and angle.
An illustration of the quality of track reconstruction is given in ﬁgures 5 and
6, which result from simulations, where the vertical cuts limit the domain
of good tracks. Outside of these cuts, there are ”bad” reconstructed tracks
with poor resolution in momentum or also fake tracks. Assuming that the
contamination of bad tracks in the simulations and in the experiment is the
same, this contamination is automatically corrected in equation (2).

3.3 Data selection

The experimental results were obtained using the following procedure.

• The incident electrons were selected by the trigger counters. Additional oﬀ-

line selection was made with the proﬁle monitor (Fig. 2).

• For further analysis only tracks with a positron-like curvature were selected.
• To reduce the background from the charged particles created outside the
target (e.g. in the target supporting structure, in the drift chamber walls,
etc.) the reconstructed track position on the target plane xt is limited within
±3σ around the peak values, where σ is the RMS of the reconstructed
position distribution.

• To reduce the rate of the fake tracks only tracks with the number of hits
Nhits ≥ 10 were selected. In Fig. 7 one can see that there is a reasonable
agreement between the simulation and experimental data for the distribu-
tion of the number of hits for one track; hence simulation can be used safely
to determine the eﬃciency.

• The positron registration eﬃciency was determined for each energy and an-
gular bin using the simulation. Such eﬃciency value is needed to evaluate
the actual yield at the target exit. The shower development in the targets
was simulated using an event generator “Shower Generation in Crystal”
(SGC) taking into account the speciﬁc character of electromagnetic inter-
actions in axially aligned crystals. The main features of SGC are given in
[4],[5]. Note that SGC can be used to describe the shower development in
amorphous targets as well.

A full description of the detector uses a GEANT code conﬁguration.
The results on positrons presented hereafter are, henceforth, taking into
account the reconstruction eﬃciency, i.e. the number of reconstructed positrons
for each energy or angle bin was divided by the corresponding eﬃciency and
detector acceptance.

The momentum resolution is depending on p value. It is between 2 and 5 %
for the tracks in the domain of interest (p < 150 MeV/c; θ < 30 degrees);

12

the best resolution being for low momenta due to the larger curvature of the
track. This momentum resolution has been determined from the comparison
between the reconstructed and simulated momenta (see Fig. 5). The value
of the momentum resolution has low impact on the shape of the measured
histograms due to the larger energy bin width (5 MeV) with respect to this
resolution. The momentum resolution is also considered in the simulations.
• The detection eﬃciency, determined by simulations, was obtained for both
values of the magnetic ﬁeld. The data corrected by eﬃciency and detector
acceptance for 1 and 4 KG magnetic ﬁeld values were merged and the diﬀer-
ence between the data and the simulations for the 20 mm amorphous target
serves as an estimator of systematic errors (see section 4.4).

4 Results

The experimental results on the 20 mm amorphous target and on the 4 and
8 mm crystals in random orientation have been compared to the simulation
with the GEANT based generator and to those obtained with the generator
SGC. A good agreement was met between experiment and simulations in all
the cases. That means that the apparatus and the reconstruction procedure
worked quite well. Moreover, a good agreement was veriﬁed between GEANT
and the SGC for the case of the amorphous target case (see Fig. 8).

4.1 Enhancement in photon production

The preshower gives the average photon multiplicity in a forward cone as a
function of the crystal orientation. On the < 111 > axis of the tungsten crys-
tal, the ultrarelativistic electrons radiate more photons than by conventional
bremsstrahlung, as shown on the right rocking curve of ﬁgure 3. Correspond-
ingly, the positron yield is enhanced (see left rocking curve of Fig. 3). In
Figs. 9–10 we can see a good agreement between simulation and experiment
concerning the preshower for 4 and 8 mm crystal, the incident electron en-
ergy being 10 GeV. In these ﬁgures we represent the spectrum of the energy
lost in the scintillator by the charged particles, created by the photons in
the converter. The ﬁrst three peaks are corresponding to i) no interaction, ii)
Compton scattering and iii) pair creation. All the results presented in Figs. 9–
10 are normalized for one event. These results do not allow to extract the
experimental photon spectrum, but serve as a check of the correctness for the
photon part of the SGC generator.

4.2 Enhancement in positron production

Typical energy and angular distributions are presented in Fig. 11 for the 4 mm
thick crystal and amorphous targets. The energy of the initial electron is 10
GeV. Simulations and experimental data are presented on the same picture.
The energy distribution concerns all positron angles up to 30 degrees, whereas
the angular distribution concerns all energies more than 5 MeV; that means
also high energies (more than 150 MeV) for which the discrepancy between
simulation and experiment is somewhat larger. Precisely, these large momenta
exhibit low angle values. In the energy domain of interest, for the positron

sources (5 < p < 50 MeV) the agreement is good between simulation and
experiment. Moreover, if we compare the crystal and amorphous targets, an
enhancement by a factor close to 4 is obtained for the oriented crystal. Similar
considerations may be formulated for the case of the 8 mm crystal target for
which:

• an enhancement slightly larger than 2 is observed in positron production
between the crystal and an amorphous target 8 mm thick, still for incident
electrons of 10 GeV. This enhancement is present but slightly lower (than
2) when the electron incident energy is of 6 GeV.

• almost identical results about the positron yields are obtained for a 8 mm
”all crystal” target and a compound target made of a 4 mm crystal followed
by a 4 mm amorphous disk. Such results conﬁrm the interest of compound
targets for which the ﬁrst part acts as a radiator and the second part as a
converter to materialize the photons in e+e− pairs.

Results on the 8 mm target are represented in Fig. 12.

represent the population of the reconstructed positron tracks in such diagrams.
Fig. 13 corresponds to the 8 mm crystal target. Results are corrected by the
reconstruction eﬃciency and the detector acceptance. It can be seen that the
highest densities of positrons are contained in a domain deﬁned by pL < 20
MeV/c and pT < 5 MeV/c. Suitable matching systems (adiabatic devices)
which are presently considered for the future linear colliders [15] are presenting
such kind of acceptance.

We also present these results, in (pL,pT ) space, in the form of tables (tables 1 to
5) giving the number of positrons in some relevant (pL,pT ) domains for all the
targets. In those tables the simulations errors are mainly systematics and found
to be near 5%. Experimental results are presented with the statistical errors.
The numbers are corrected by the reconstruction eﬃciency and the detector
acceptance. These tables where results from experiment and simulations are

compared show that:

• the expected positron yield may be determined accurately, provided the
matching system has been precisely deﬁned. The matching systems are usu-
ally characterized by the accepted energy domain and by the maximum
transverse momentum; the latter depending on the maximum magnetic
ﬁelds of the matching lenses.

• the increase of the positron yield with the maximum longitudinal momen-
tum for a given maximum transverse momentum is rather slow, showing
that there is a predominance of soft positrons with crystal targets.

• the accepted yield may be improved signiﬁcantly by increasing the max-
imum transverse momentum. For a given energy domain, 5 < pL < 25
MeV/c the yield is improved by a factor between 1.6 and 2 when increasing
the maximum transverse momentum from 4 to 8 MeV/c.

• the discrepancies between simulations and experiment are within 10 to 25
% (for the worst case, i.e. the 8 mm target). This is not negligible but com-
parable with usual diﬀerences between phase space simulations and mea-
surements.

4.4 Systematic errors

Various sources of systematic errors on the positron yield can be considered.
They are discussed below.

Using the simulation, the inﬂuence of the beam angular spread was estimated
to be negligible. The errors induced by the trigger selection were estimated
applying a modiﬁed cut on the proﬁles given by the delay chamber: the error
is 3%.

Systematic errors on the calibration “time-radius” of the drift chamber led to
a 3% error on the results.

Measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld contain errors which led, according to
simulations, to an uncertainty of 4% on the positron momentum measurement.

Comparing the amorphous target simulations for the SGC and GEANT gen-
erators, a 5% systematic error was assigned to the generator induced uncer-
tainties.

The main source of the systematic errors is in the estimations of the eﬃciency
and fake track rate. This uncertainty has several sources: a diﬀerence between
the real and assumed positions of the positron detector relative to the target;
the charge collection dependence on the track multiplicity in the cell; the
dependence of the gas multiplication factor on the coordinates along the wire;

17

border eﬀects in the drift chamber cell. Comparing the experimental results
concerning the 20 mm amorphous target with the simulations using GEANT
and SGC generators, the error was found to be equal to 8%.

The total systematic error is 10%.

Additional reliability checks were performed. It was checked that the results
obtained with 1 and 4 KG magnetic ﬁeld are the same in the region of the
positron momentum available for both values.

The 20 mm amorphous target gives approximately the same occupancy in the
positron detector as the 8 mm crystal target. The positron spectra for the
20 mm are in good agreement with the simulation, which proves the correct
eﬃciency and fake track rate estimation for the case with the biggest track
occupancy in the experiment. However it was found that the 8 mm oriented
crystal produces 20% less positrons compared to the simulation prediction
(Fig. 12). This could be the indication that the simulation in this case is less
precise or that the experimental systematic errors are underestimated.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The main results obtained in this experiment show:

• a clear enhancement in photon and positron generations when comparing
crystal and amorphous targets of the same thickness. This enhancement is
close to 4 for 4 mm target and larger than 2 for 8 mm target with a 10 GeV
electron beam. The enhancement is somewhat lower at 6 GeV.

• a good equivalence between the results for 8 mm crystal and the compound
target allows the use of the latter instead of the all-crystal, for thermal
reasons.

• a large number of soft positrons due to the materialization of soft photons.
The channeling and coherent bremsstrahlung processes provide softer pho-
tons than classical bremsstrahlung. So an enhanced number of soft positrons
due to the materialization of these soft photons is available. The practical
interest is a better matching with known energy acceptances of currently
used matching systems.

• a good agreement between simulations and experiment for photons and
positrons. This result validates the simulations based on crystal processes,
permitting reliable simulations with diﬀerent incident energies and crystal
types (material, orientation, thickness). That is essential to optimize this
kind of source.

We may add an additive argument for the use of crystal targets, due
to investigations on the deposited energy in these targets [6]. It results

18

from these calculations that even if the PEDD in crystal and amorphous
targets giving the same yield is practically the same, the total deposited
energy is much less in the crystal case. This set of arguments make this
kind of positron source attractive. It justiﬁes also the continuous interest in
investigating such sources as it can be veriﬁed presently at KEK [16],[17].

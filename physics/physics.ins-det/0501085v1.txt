Abstract

We have derived a time dependent solution describing the development of space

charge inside an ion chamber, subjected to an externally caused ionization rate N.

The solution enables the derivation of a formula that the operational parameters

of the chamber must satisfy for saturation free operation. This formula contains a

correction factor to account for the ﬁnite duration of the ionization rate N.

Key words:

Ionization chambers, Saturation, Time dependent solution

1 Introduction

It is a well known eﬀect that the operation of ion chambers in a high ioniza-

tion environment is limited by the space charge accumulated in the chamber

active volume. This space charge is dominated by the positive ions since the

electrons move with a drift velocity 1,000 times larger. The resulting electric

ﬁeld inside the chamber is no more uniform and it takes its least absolute

value near the anode.

When this value reaches zero the electron collection stops and the chamber

becomes saturated. It is well known [1,2,3,4] that a distinction between long

and short pulses should be made when attempting to calculate saturation ef-

fects. In the short pulse approximation the duration of ionization and charge

collection time is short with respect to the time the positive ions need to move

appreciably with respect to the distance d between the chamber electrodes.

In this approximation the positive ions are considered practically immovable

throughout the whole electron collection time, thus the space charge density

inside the chamber is uniform and constant. In the long pulse approximation

the duration of ionization is long enough that a steady state is reached. In

this state the number of collected positive ions per unit time is equal to the

number of generated by the external ionization factor. The space chargg is

no more depending on time but only on the position x between the chamber

electrodes.

In this paper we derive a time dependent solution of the space charge ac-

cummulated in the chamber. We have made the assumption that the positive

ions are moving with a constant drift velocity Vdrif t=µ

V0
d throughout the

·

whole ionization and charge collection time. This solution collapses into the

short pulse approximation for ionization times much less than the characteris-

tic time of the chamber T0, and yields the steady state solution for ionization

times larger or equal to T0. We derive a simple expression for the quantity

T0, the characteristic time of the ion chamber, as well as for the electric ﬁels

inside the chamber as a function of space and time.

Finally we derive a modiﬁed saturation equation, which deﬁnes the conditions

that the operational paramenters of the ion chamber should satisfy in order for

2

the detector to operate free of saturation eﬀects. This equation is a function

not only of the positive ion mobility µ, the electrode gap d and the externally

applied voltage V0, but a function of the duration T of the external ionization

as well.

Throughout the discussion we have assumed that the cathode plate is kept at

potential -V0 at x=0 and the anode is grounded at x=d. In our calculations

we have used the esu system of units.

2 The Steady State

The accummulation of space charge inside the ion chamber, subjected in a

constant external ionization rate N, is governed by the continuity equations:

p(x, t)up(x, t) for the positive ions, and:

n(x, t)un(x, t) for the electrons.[1,4,9]

Here up is the positive ion and un the electron drift velocities. For x=d

p(d,t)=0, and for x=0 n(0,t)=0 that is the consentration of positive ions next

to the anode and the consentration of electrons next to the cathode are always

zero. Also at t=0 p(x,0)=n(x,0)=0. In the steady state:

p(x)= N (d

Since the mobility of the electrons is 1,000 larger than the positive ions we

can ignore the electron contribution to the spacecharge and thus we will write

3 The Short Pulse Approximation

When the ion chamber is subjected to an intense short lived ionization pulse

the short pulse approximation is more suitable to describe the space charge

eﬀectsin the operation of the detector. We can model the space charge density

inside the chamber at the end of the ionization pulse as ρ, constant throughout

the chamber volume. Solution of Maxwell equations for the electric ﬁeld yields:

E(x)=4πρx-2πρd- V0

d =-4π(xsat-x) where xsat= d

2+ V0

4πρd

The electric ﬁeld becomes zero at x=xsat. Thus, in order for the chamber

to work free of saturation eﬀects xsat≥

d which leads to the condition:

2πρ.

An interesting consequence of the short pulse approximation is that always, a

portion of the fast moving electrons is collected. If we suppose that the whole

ionisation happens instantaneously the fast electron swarm will keep moving

(and collected at the anode) from x=0 to x=xsat where the electric ﬁeld be-

5

comes zero. We have considered the electron drift velocity as a product of the

electron mobility times the Electric ﬁeld. If we suppose that all the electrons

from x=0 to x=xsat have been collected and electrons between x=xsat and

x=d have been lost (since the drift velosity has become zero), the collection

eﬃciency can be estimated as

ǫcoll = xsat

d = 1

2 + V0

4πρd2 if xsat ≤

d otherwise ǫcoll=1

We have ignored all recombination eﬀects during the electron movement. We

see that for extremely fast pulses the collection eﬃciency is at least 0.5, even

with the chamber operating under saturation conditions. The collection eﬃ-

ciency also increases linearly with the applied voltage V0 and it is inverseley

proportional to the charge density ρ. Recently conducted experiments have

observed this eﬀect.[10,11]

5 Conclusion

After a brief review of the operation of ion chambers in an intense ionization

environment we presented a formula describing the time development of the

space charge inside the chamber. The formula collapses into the short pulse

approximation for short enough ionization pulses with respect to the char-

acteristic time of chamber T0 and reproduces the steady state solution if the

externally caused ionization lasts long enough. Although the formula has been

derived under the assumption that the positive ions are moving always with a

constant drift velocity µ
V0
d , it helps us to understand (qualitatively and up to
·

some degree quantitatively) the operation of ion chambers. More speciﬁcally

we deduce:

The steady state is reached throughout the whole chamber volume within

a ﬁnite time T0 (the characteristic time of the ion chamber) after the onset

of the external ionization process. However, as we showed in this paper,

diﬀerent points reach the steady state at diﬀerent times.

For short enough pulsed beams with respect to the ion chamber charac-

teristic time the positive ion mobility µ does not play any role in judging

saturation eﬀects. [10]

Saturation eﬀects should be judged by taking into account not only the

chamber operating voltage, gap and ion mobility but the duration of the

ionization process as well.

Whether we assume that the positive ions move with constant drift velocity

or their speed is aﬀected by the variation of the electric ﬁeld due to the

space charge, for short pulses both solutions collapse into the short pulse

approximation and no distinction is made. Corrections may be important

when the steady state is formed due to the diﬀerent space distribution of

the positive ion charge density inside the chamber. The maximum correction

must be applied when steady state is reached. As we have seen that factor

is

1.22. An eﬀort to solve the continuity equations, that describe the

time development of the positive ion distribution in the chamber, by using

computational techniques is presented in a recent paper[8].

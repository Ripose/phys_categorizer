Abstract

Calibration of the three layer NaI(Tl) spherical calorimeter of the SND detec-
tor using electron – positron scattering events is described. Energy resolution of
5%(FWHM/2.36) for 500 MeV photons was achieved.

1 Introduction

The SND is a general purpose nonmagnetic detector ( Fig. 1 ) operating at
VEPP-2M e+e− collider in BINP ( Novosibirsk ) in the center of mass energy
range of 0.2 ÷ 1.4 GeV. [1,2]. Experimental studies include decays of ρ, ω, φ
mesons and nonresonance hadron production at low energies. Good energy
resolution for photons in a wide energy range from 30 to 700 MeV is essen-
tial for suppression of background in reconstruction of intermediate π0 and
η mesons and detection of photons emitted in radiative transitions between
diﬀerent quarkonium states. Fast preliminary calibration of the calorimeter
is based on cosmic muons [3]. It provides reasonable energy resolution of
5.5%(FWHM/2.36) for 500 MeV photons, but to increase resolution to its
highest value it is necessary to use experimental events with precisely known
energies of ﬁnal particles. In addition, such a process should have clear event
topology, be well separated from background, and have large cross section. Po-
tentially suitable processes are e+e− → e+e−, e+e− → γγ, e+e− → π+π−, e+e− →
µ+µ−, but given the VEPP-2M luminosity of 3 · 1030cm−2s−1 at 1 GeV, only
e+e− → e+e− produces enough statistics for calibration of the calorimeter in
a reasonably short time.

2 The SND calorimeter

SND detector [1] ( Fig. 1) consists of a cylindrical drift chamber, calorimeter,
and muon system. The three-layer NaI(Tl) spherical calorimeter, consisting
of 1632 individual counters ( Fig. 2) is a main part of the detector. It was
described in [3], so let us mention only some details necessary for description
of the calibration procedure.

Calorimeter solid angle coverage in a spherical coordinate system with Z axis
directed along the electron beam is 18◦ ≤ θ ≤ 162◦ and 0◦ ≤ φ ≤ 360◦.
Calorimeter is logically divided into two parts: “small” angles 18◦ ≤ θ ≤ 36◦
and 144◦ ≤ θ ≤ 162◦, and “large” angles: 36◦ ≤ θ ≤ 144◦. The angular dimen-
sions of crystals at “large” angles are ∆φ = ∆θ = 9◦ and ∆φ = 18◦, ∆θ = 9◦
at “small” angles. The calorimeter layers are enumerated starting from the
interaction point – the ﬁrst one is the nearest to the beam.

The calorimeter energy resolutions for 500 MeV electrons, photons, and muons
after primary calibration using cosmic muons are shown in the Table 1. While
peak positions in Monte Carlo simulation and experiment agree at a 1% level,
experimental resolutions are signiﬁcantly worse than simulated ones. The pos-
sible explanations of the diﬀerences in simulated and experimental spectra
could be attributed to instability of the detector electronics, systematic er-
rors in the cosmic calibration procedure, and inadequate treatment of nonuni-
formity of light collection eﬃciency over the crystal volume in Monte Carlo
simulation.

Relative stability of calibration constants in time [3], shows that electronics
and photodetectors instabilities do not contribute much into experimental
resolutions. To eliminate systematic biases of cosmic calibration procedure,
the OFF-LINE calibration based on e+e− → e+e− events was performed.

3 The calibration method.

The calibration constants based on e+e− scattering events could be obtained
by minimization of the expression:

F (Ci) = X

(X

j

i

Uij · Ci − E0)2,

(1)

where j – event number, i – crystal number, Uij is an energy deposition in
ith crystal and jth event, E0 – beam energy, Ci – calibration constant for ith
crystal. Similar calibration procedure was implemented in CLEO II detector

2

[4], but layered structure of the SND calorimeter complicates the task due to
large ﬂuctuations of energy depositions in the calorimeter layers and energy
dependence of longitudinal development of electromagnetic shower. Although
r.m.s. of the energy deposition spectra in an individual crystals are about
100%, the statistical accuracy of Ci must be high, due to strong correlations
between energy depositions in diﬀerent crystals in an event. The drawbacks of
such a direct method are that the calibration constants are dependent on the
energy of the electrons and produce biased values of average energy depositions
in calorimeter layers.

To avoid such complications the SND calorimeter calibration is based on com-
parison of coeﬃcients C mc
, obtained using simulated and experimen-
tal electrons of the same energy.

After cosmic calibration the measured energy deposition in ith crystal Ui can
be written as Ui = ǫi·Ei, where Ei is an actual energy deposition and diﬀerence
of ǫi from unity, characterizes the systematic shift of cosmic calibration for
ith crystal. To compensate for this shift it is necessary to ﬁnd corresponding
correction coeﬃcient C cal
i = 1/ǫi. These calibration constants are obtained in
the following way. First, the functions:

Eij – energy depositions in crystals in Monte Carlo simulation, Uij – measured
energy depositions in experimental e+e− events, E0 – beam energy ( the same
in experimental and simulated events ). The minimums of the functions are
determined by the following conditions:

∂F (Ci)/∂Ci = 0

The calibration constants C cal

are independent of the energy of electrons, and do not produce biases in energy
depositions in calorimeter layers.

For calorimeter calibration e+e− → e+e− events were simulated. In order to
save simulation time, angular distribution was set to uniform over the solid
angle. The passage of electrons through the detector was simulated by means
of the UNIMOD2 code [5].

Both experimental and simulated e+e− → e+e− events are selected according
to the same criteria: only two particles must be detected, the total energy
deposition in the calorimeter is greater than 1.2 · E0 and acollinearity angle
is less than 10 degrees. All crystals with energy depositions less than 5 MeV
are discarded. Remaining crystals are put into calculation of the elements of
matrix A and vector b. When events processing is ﬁnished, the linear system is
solved using SLAP2 [6] package, i.e. C exp
are obtained for all crystals
and then C cal
are calculated.

This calibration procedure was used in the OFF-LINE processing of the data
collected in 1996 ÷ 1997 in the center of mass energy range 0.99 ÷ 1.04 GeV
[1].

To obtain C mc
, 50000 simulated events with 500 MeV electrons were processed,
corresponding to about 150 electrons per crystal. The mean hC mci and their
r.m.s. values σmc are listed in the Table 2. In principle, the coeﬃcients may
depend on the electron energy, layer number, and crystal size. But at this level
of statistics no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in C mc
values for diﬀerent crystal sizes
in the “large” angle part is seen. The statistical accuracy σmc
can be
estimated as σmc

C = σmc/hC mci ( Table 2 ).

The statistical accuracy of calibration constants for the ﬁrst two layers is sat-
isfactory, but for the third layer it is larger than that for cosmic calibration
[3]. This is due to relatively small energy deposition of electromagnetic show-
ers in the third layer, combined with large number of hit crystals. Thus the
inﬂuence of the accuracy of calibration constants in the third layer on an over-
all calorimeter resolution for electrons and photons is small. The situation is
diﬀerent for muons and charged pions, where relative energy deposition in crys-

4

tals of the third layer is large. In this case high statistical error in calibration
coeﬃcients signiﬁcantly increases the widths of energy deposition spectra. So,
instead of C cal
, the coeﬃcients obtained during cosmic calibration were used
for the third layer.

i

The r.m.s. diﬀerence σsys in calibration coeﬃcients obtained using cosmic and
e+e− calibration procedures can be estimated as σsys = q(σexp)2 − (σexp
C )2.
This value is about 4% for the ﬁrst two layers and is less than 5% for the third
layer.

5 Energy resolution of the calorimeter. Implementation of the cal-

ibration procedure

As a result of e+e− calibration the calorimeter energy resolutions for 500 MeV
electrons and photons ( Table 1, Fig.3 ) were improved by 10%, but still remain
worse than those expected from Monte Carlo simulation.

A Monte Carlo simulation of energy deposition was ﬁrst carried out with a
uniform description of the nonuniformity of the light collection eﬃciency over
the crystal volume. Then, calculations taking into account nonuniform “direct”
light from a scintillation and diﬀuse reﬂection from the crystal boundaries and
wrapping were performed. The energy deposition U in crystal measured in
experiment is

U(MeV) = C(MeV/pC) · e · ν · ζ(1/MeV) · ψ · E(MeV),

(4)

where E is an energy deposition in the scintillation counter, C – ratio between
the collected electric charge from photodetector, measured in pC, and energy
deposition in the units of MeV, ν - quantum eﬃciency of the photodetector
multiplied by its gain, ζ - light yield of the scintillator, ψ - light collection
eﬃciency, e - electron charge. In general, ψ is a function of coordinates within
the crystal and depends on reﬂection coeﬃcient on the crystal boundaries and
photocathode diameter.

To take into account the nonuniformity of light collection eﬃciency, the crys-
tal response was simulated taking into account a uniform light collection due
to diﬀuse reﬂection and nonuniform “direct” light collection, depending on
a solid angle of a photocathode, visible from a scintillation point. The re-
sults of such simulation the energy distribution width for 500 MeV photons
is 4.2%(FWHM/2.36) ( Fig. 4 ). The experimental spectrum is shown in the
same ﬁgure. Calorimeter resolutions for other types of particles are also shown
in Table 1. The agreement between experiment and simulation became much

5

better and the residual disagreement could be attributed to diﬀerence in dif-
fuse reﬂection coeﬃcients values in diﬀerent crystals.

To study the calorimeter response for photons as a function of photon energy,
the events e+e− → γγ and e+e− → e+e−γ were used. The kinematic ﬁt of the
e+e− → e+e−γ events was performed taking into account energy–momentum
conservation and the reconstructed photon energies Eγ
rec were obtained. These
values were compared with direct calorimeter measurements. One could expect
strong correlation between these values, but study of the simulated e+e− →
e+e−γ events, where the energy of the photon is precisely known, showed, that
even for photons in the energy range from 30 up to 150 MeV these correlation
do not change signiﬁcantly the calorimeter response. The energy range above
170 MeV was also studied using 2γ annihilation events and results agree well
with those for e+e− → e+e−γ reaction. The dependence of calorimeter energy
resolution on photon energies ( Fig. 5 ) was ﬁtted as

σE/E(%) =

4.2%

4

qE(GeV)

(5)

After calorimeter calibration with e+e− → e+e− events, the photon energies
turned out to be biased by about 1% ( Table. 1, Fig. 4 ). In oder to compensate
this bias, the calibration coeﬃcients for photons were corrected accordingly.
The distributions over two-photon invariant masses mγγ in φ → ηγ and Ks →
π0π0 decays after such correction are shown at Fig. 6 and 7. Peaks at π0 and
η mesons masses are clearly seen.

Relative drift of calibration coeﬃcients is shown in Fig.8. It can be seen,
that for a time period between consecutive calibrations, the mean shift of the
coeﬃcients is about 1% and r.m.s. of their random spread is about 2.5% for
the ﬁrst two layers and about 5% for the third layer.

Using the described procedure for the SND calorimeter calibration the sta-
tistical accuracy of 2% in calibration constants for the ﬁrst two layers was
achieved. The ﬁnal resolution for photons varies from 10% at 50 MeV to 5%
at 500 MeV.

Abstract

We measured the thickness of an insensitive surface layer of a PIN photodiode,
Hamamatsu S3590-06, used in the Tokyo Axion Helioscope. We made alpha-particles
impinge on the PIN photodiode in various incidence angles and measured the pulse
height to estimate the thickness of the insensitive surface layer. This measurement
showed its thickness was 0.31± 0.02 µm on the assumption that the insensitive layer
consisted of Si. We calculated the peak detection eﬃciency for low energy x-rays in
consideration of the insensitive layer and escape of x-rays and Auger electrons. This
result showed the eﬃciency for 4-10keV x-rays was more than 95%.

1 Introduction

A PIN photodiode is a very useful device. It is used not just for a photosensor
but also for a detector of charged particles, x-rays and gamma-rays by a lot of
experiments in high energy physics. A PIN photodiode is an improved version
of the low-capacitance planar silicon photodiode and makes use of an extra
high-resistance I-layer between a P- and an N+-layer to improve response time.
This type of device exhibits went up response time when used with reversed
bias and so is designed with high resistance to breakdown and low leakage for
such applications. We use PIN photodiodes for an x-ray detector in the search

experiment for solar axions (the Tokyo Axion Helioscope (Fig. 1) [1] [2]),
because of a low sensitivity to magnetic ﬁelds, tolerance to low-temperature,
and high eﬃciency for low energy x-rays [3].

However, it has a slight disadvantage. There is non-active area so-called ‘a
dead layer’ which consists of the SiO2 layer formed on the detector surface as
a protective ﬁlm and the P-layer on a PIN photodiode. But these layers do
not perform as depleted layers. They have no sensitivity. It could worsen the
sensitivity to low energy x-rays in our experiment. In [1], we reported that the
thickness was 6.1 µm at 95% C.L. But we thought the true value was much
less than this one.

In this work, we determined the thickness of the insensitive surface layer of
the PIN photodiode to recalculate the upper limit of axion-photon coupling
constant using the data obtained in our earlier experiments [1] [2].

2 Experimental Apparatus

To measure the thickness of the insensitive surface layer, we made alpha-
particles from an 241Am source impinge on a PIN photodiode at various inci-
dence angles. The range for the 5486 MeV alpha-particle in silicon is 24 µm
and much less than the thickness of the expected depletion layer. Respective
path lengths of alpha-particles in the insensitive and sensitive layers depend
on their incidence angle. Therefore, it enables us to estimate the thickness
of the insensitive layer measuring pulse heights of alpha-particles in the PIN
photodiode as a function of the incidence angle.

The experimental setup is shown in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. The experimental ap-
paratus were put in a vacuum (pressure less than 10−3 Pa). We could rotate
the PIN photodiode from the outside of the vacuum to change the incidence
angle. The PIN photodiode was exposed to 5486 MeV alpha-particles from
the 241Am source installed in a brass holder. The brass holder had a stainless
steel pipe of φ4.3 mm inner diameter and 50 mm length as a collimator. The
distance between the source and the detector is 60 mm.

The PIN photodiode we used is Hamamatsu S3590-06. It is 11×11 mm2 in
size and 500 µm in thickness. This PIN photodiode is the same type as ones
used in the Tokyo Axion Helioscope [1][2]. It has high eﬃciency to x-rays of
energies up to 10 keV, energy range of x-rays to which solar axions convert in
magnetic ﬁelds.

3 Result and Discussion

We measured spectra for 8 incidence angles, 0◦, ±15◦, ±30◦, ±45◦, and +60◦
(Fig. 5). Each spectrum in Fig. 5 exhibits peaks of 5486 keV around 2900
ch. The alpha-particle peak channels shifted lower with increasing incidence
angles, suggesting an existence of the insensitive surface layer.

We determined the peak channel C(θ) by ﬁtting a gaussian function to spec-
trum of the incidence angle θ. In the ﬁtting, we use the upper half region of
each peak, because the lower half contained the eﬀect of the thickness of the
241Am source and the spread of incidence angles of alpha-particles.

Fig. 6 shows the relation between the peak channels C(θ) and incidence angles
θ together with the best ﬁt to the data by the equation,

C(θ) =

E0

,

where d is the thickness of the insensitive layer of the PIN photodiode, E0 is
the energy of alpha-particles of 241Am, dE
dx is the stopping power, the insensi-
tive layer for the alpha-particles, and α and β are parameters of the relation
between channels and energies;

E [keV] = α(C [ch] − β).

Since we do not know the percentage of Si and SiO2 in the insensitive layer,
we calculated the thickness for the case it consisted of Si and the case of SiO2.
The stopping power of SiO2 is a little larger than that of Si, therefore, the
estimate value of the thickness is a little smaller. In the ﬁtting, d and β were
left free and α was ﬁxed at 2.24. This value was determined by calibration
with alpha-particles from 241Am in vacuum and decelerated alpha-particles
from the same source in the air. Thereby we got d = 0.31 ± 0.02 µm with
χ2/ndf = 6.73/6 for Si and 13% smaller for SiO2. At worst, in the case that
the insensitive layer consisted of Si, the thickness is less than 0.35 µm at 95%
C.L. This is nearly 1

20 of the value we conservatively assumed before [1].

If the insensitive layer were relatively thick as we supposed before, then the
detection eﬃciency for the x-ray would be largely aﬀected by absorption in
it. However, it is not the case because the insensitive layer is thin enough,
less than 15% of the absorption length for 5 keV x-rays. However, one still
has to take into account loss of energy caused by escape of x-rays and Auger
electrons from the detector following photoelectric absorption of the incoming
x-ray. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate the peak detec-
tion eﬃciency for x-rays of energy range between 2 keV and 10 keV with the

GEANT4 program [4]. In the simulation we assumed that the insensitive layer
consists of Si. The results are shown in Fig. 7. The errors for the estimation are
too small to show on the data points. The estimated peak detection eﬃciency
is more than 95% in the energy range between 4 and 10 keV. The decreasing
eﬃciency toward low energy is due to the absorption in the insensitive layer
and lower eﬃciency above 9 keV is caused by the insuﬃciency of the thick-
ness of the depletion layer. Even if we simulated on the assumption that the
insensitive layer consisted of SiO2, the result did not change signiﬁcantly.

4 Conclusion

We showed the thickness of an insensitive layer of a PIN photodiode, S3590-06
produced by Hamamatsu, is 0.31 ± 0.02 µm for Si or 13% smaller for SiO2.
Therefore, the upper limit of the thickness is 0.35 µm at 95% C.L. in the
case of the insensitive layer consisted entirely of Si. We calculated the peak
eﬃciency of a PIN photodiode for x-rays in consideration of the thickness
of the insensitive layer and escape of x-rays and Auger electrons from the
detector. This result showed the eﬃciency as more than 95% for 4-10 keV
x-rays, which correspond to the energy range observed in the Tokyo Axion
Helioscope experiment [1] [2].

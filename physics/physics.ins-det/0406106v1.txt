Introdution

1.1 The Borexino experiment

Borexino, a large sale liquid sintillator detetor under onstrution at the Gran Sasso under-

ground laboratory (LNGS), is a low energy solar neutrino detetor designed for

7Be-neutrinos

registering[1℄. The sintillation photons produed by the reoil eletrons are deteted by 2200

photoeletron multiplier tubes (PMTs) plaed around a transparent inner vessel ontaining a sin-

tillating mixture.

In addition 200 PMTs are used in the external Cherenkov light muon veto

system. The Borexino design is desribed in detail elsewhere [2℄.

The Monte Carlo simulation of the Borexino detetor predit that the mean number of photo-

eletrons (p.e.) registered by one PMT will be in the region 0.02 − 2.0 for an event with energy of

250-800 keV. The interation point in the detetor is reonstruted using the time information from

PMTs. The position resolution depends therefor on the preision of measurement of the arrival

time of a single photoeletron. The aurate energy measurement in its turn demands good single

eletron harge resolution. Hene, the PMTs should demonstrate a good single eletron perfor-

mane both for the amplitude and the timing response. Furthermore, in order to minimize the

probability of the random triggers during the aquisition, the PMT should feature a low dark rate.

Another parameter to be kept under ontrol is the probability of the delayed trigger of the sys-

tem whih depends on the PMT afterpulsing rate (mainly ioni afterpulses). The overall required

detetor performanes de(cid:28)ne the aeptable harateristis for the PMTs, whih are summarized

in table 1. After preliminary tests ([3, 4, 5, 6℄), the ETL9351

with a large area photoathode

4

(8(cid:17)) has been hosen [7℄. Beause of very low radioative bakground needed for the operation

of the Borexino detetor, very strit limits were set on the ontent of the radioative impurities

in the PMT onstrutive materials. All the PMT omponents were thoroughly examined for the

ontent of the radioative elements from the

g/g) and

232T h hains (< 1 × 10−8
PMT. The radioativity measurements were performed with Ge spetrometry at the Gran Sasso

g/g of natural K ontent) in the glass of the

40K (< 2 × 10−5

g/g), and

238U (design radiopurity of < 3 × 10−8

underground laboratory. The design radiopurities of all the PMTs omponents were ahieved, the

detailed report on the measurements an be found in [8℄.

Before installation all PMTs have been tested in the speial faility. The proedure of the testing

inludes adjustment of the operating voltage in order to set the multiplier gain to k = 2 × 107

.

In August 2001 bulk testing of 2350 PMTs for the Borexino was ompleted, and 2000 PMTs

with the best performanes were seleted for the installation in the Borexino detetor. The high

e(cid:30)ieny of the equipment permitted to omplete PMT testing within 4 months.

1.2 8(cid:17) PMT ETL9351 and its harateristis

A PMT of this model has 12 dynodes with a total gain of k = 107
single p.e. response is about 1 ns. The PMT has a good energy resolution haraterized by the

. The transit time spread of the

at the time of the tests this type of photomultiplier was named Thorn EMI9351

The PMTs delivered are fatory tested and the operational high voltage (HV) is spei(cid:28)ed by

the manufaturer. Seletive measurements of the PMTs at the spei(cid:28)ed voltage showed a high

variane of the gain near its mean value of k = (0.86 ± 0.25) × 107

. Moreover, the high voltage

divider used by ETL and the one used in Borexino are di(cid:27)erent. For these reasons the operational

voltage was readjusted. The Borexino PMT divider is shown in Fig.1. The signal and the high

voltage are arried on the same able. The signal deoupler sheme is shown in Fig.2. For proper

signal termination a 50Ω resistor R1 is inluded in the anode hain. The resistor dereases the

signal amplitude by a fator of 2. The signal attenuation is ompensated by the higher operating

voltage. Thus atually, the high voltage is adjusted for eah PMT in order to provide photoeletron

multiplier gain k = 2 × 107

2 The PMT test faility at LNGS

Several PMT test failities were prepared in the past by ollaborations planning to use big number

of PMTs in their detetors, suh as the IMB [9℄, CHOOZ [10℄ and SNO [11℄ experiments. Also

for the Borexino experiment a speial PMT test faility was prepared at the LNGS. The photo-

multipliers used in the prototype of the Borexino detetor, the Counting Test Faility (CTF) [12℄,

were tested with a simpler faility, desribed in [6℄. The Borexino PMT test faility is plaed in

two adjaent rooms. In one room the eletronis is mounted, while the other one is a dark room

with 4 wooden tables designed to hold up to 64 PMTs. The tables are separated from eah other

by blak shrouds, whih shield the light re(cid:29)eted from the PMTs photoathode. Together with

the aeptane tests, performane of the PMTs immersed in water was tested, in order to study

the possible mehanial problems for PMTs to be mounted at the bottom part of the Borexino

detetor. For this purpose 3 pressurized Water Tanks (WT) were installed, eah of the tanks an

hold up to 20 PMTs. For the purpose of the long-term testing of the PMTs in onditions lose

to the ones of the Borexino detetor a Two-Liquid Test Tank (TLTT) was designed and installed

in the laboratory [13℄. 48 PMTs are installed in the TLTT, with the base being in water and the

bulb immersed in liquid sintillator. Atually, the TLTT test has now been running for more than

3 years, data is taken periodially in order to hek the PMT signal degradation. Only two PMTs

of the total 48 are found non-operational after these 3 years.

The overall test faility is therefore able to measure the harateristis of 172 PMTs if ompletely

loaded. The eletronis system onsists of the high voltage supplies and the independent signal

proessing eletronis. The high voltage supplies an provide high voltage to all PMT under test.

In order to avoid unneessary system dupliation, only 32 eletronis hannels are used for the

signal proessing at the same time. The PMTs under test are grouped by no more than 32 in

one group. The swithing between the groups is performed by means of 8 analogial multiplexers,

whih provide ontrol over 4 omplete groups. Two groups of 32 PMTs eah are onneted to the

64 ables of the dark room. Another two groups an be onneted interhanging the ables either

to the 60 PMTs in the WTs (20 PMTs eah), or to the 48 PMTs of the TLTT (24 PMT in eah

group). The tests with the TLTT are rare and the onnetion of the signal ables is performed

manually.

The dark room is equipped with a system ompensating the Earth's magneti (cid:28)eld ([14℄). The

non-uniformity of the ompensated (cid:28)eld in the plane of the tables is no more than 10%. In the

WTs and the TLTT the Earth Magneti Field is not ompensated.

The PMT harateristis are de(cid:28)ned during a 8 hours run. The stability of the parameters is

de(cid:28)ned every 12-24 hours during longer runs.

2.1 The Earth magneti (cid:28)eld ompensation system

Magneti (cid:28)elds as weak as the Earth's magneti (cid:28)eld (EMF, ∼ 40µT ) a(cid:27)et PMT performanes

and it turns out that tubes with linear fousing dynodes (as the Borexino 8" ETL9351) are most

sensitive to magneti in(cid:29)uene when the (cid:28)eld is parallel to the dynodes [5, 15℄.

In the area of the external Gran Sasso Laboratory the stati EMF is about 35µT in the

5

vertial diretion, 25µT along the north-south diretion and 8µT along the east-west diretion.
A daily hange around 0.05µT was observed. Therefore, a ompensation of the north-south and

vertial omponents of the stati EMF was needed; the omponent varying in time is negligible

and an be left without ompensation. Sine the test faility tables oupy in total 2x2 m

, a large

ompensated volume is needed. The EMF ompensation system of the test faility is based on a

system of retangular oils

; the hoie is haraterized by simple onstrution, easy aess to the

5

internal area, and by an exellent ratio of uniform (cid:28)eld to oils volume [17℄. Sine the dark room

is in iron-reinfored onrete building with dimensions of 5x5x3 m

made of two sandwih-walls,

3

one should expet spatial variations of the EMF over the useful volume. Therefore, the EMF was

mapped inside the dark room. Moreover, in order to avoid any interferene with the ompensation

system, the support struture for the phototubes has been manufatured with wood.

A number of various systems of retangular and square oils was studied. A four square oils

system (FCMS) as designed by R. Merritt and oworker [17℄ was hosen in order to ompensate

the ruial north-south omponent. In order to analyze the magneti (cid:28)eld reated by the FCMS a

master formula for a general retangular oil was written as desribed in [14℄. The (cid:28)eld uniformity

inside the oils system, U , was haraterized by the (cid:28)eld deviations with respet to the (cid:28)eld at the

enter:

U = |

−→
H (x, y, z) −

−→
H (0, 0, 0)

−→
H (x, y, z)

|.

where

−→
H (x, y, z) is the (cid:28)eld at the point (x, y, z) and

−→
H (0, 0, 0) is the (cid:28)eld at the enter of the
−→
H (0, 0, 0) was hosen to fully ompensate the measured EMF at the dark room

system. The (cid:28)eld

enter. The oil urrents were alulated on the basis of this value.

A FCMS with 2.84m oils side length was hosen to ompensate the north-south omponent.

Another system onsisting of two square oils with 2.98 m side length and spaing equal to 1.4m

(1)

6

was hosen to ompensate the vertial omponent of the EMF. The e(cid:27)et of the (cid:28)nite ross setion

of the oils (66 mm

) was taken into aount as desribed in [20℄, but the orretions were found

2

to be negligible beause of the huge oil sizes.

The useful volume for arranging the PMTs was de(cid:28)ned determining the 10% deviation of the

magneti (cid:28)eld from the mean value in a plane rossing the enter of the oil system. All (cid:28)eld

omponents were treated independently. In Fig.3 is shown the oil system with it referene frame.

The measurements on(cid:28)rmed a good uniformity of the EMF in a volume of 2x2x0.6 m

lying in

the xz plane. In Table 2 all the parameters of the six oil system are reported.

The measurements of the EMF inside the dark room were performed with an analog Magneto-

sope 1.608 by Foerster whih is an intensity and gradient magneti (cid:28)eld sensor operating with a

Foerster probe. The preision of the instrument is 3% for all the sales. Two sets of measurement

were performed at the level of 146 and 129 m from the ground. The results of measurement were

reported in [21℄. On the basis of the analysis of the (cid:28)eld uniformity, the PMT support tables were

plaed in a suitable area (far away from the entrane door and the ables path-panel). Measure-

Many oils systems have been studied in order to produe an homogeneous magneti (cid:28)eld [16, 17, 18℄.

The Helmholtz separation for suh a system is 1.62m [19℄. This spaing is not the best solution to ahieve the

maximum uniformity over a large volume with two square oils [20℄.

The power supply for the 6 oil system inside the dark room (see Fig.3) is guaranteed by a

single double Elind generator whih is able to provide a stabilized urrent up to 0.01 A. Eah oil

onsists of a wooden struture with three layers of opper-wire turns (see Table 2). Fig.4 and Fig.5

present the results of the (cid:28)nal measurements after the oil installation.

One the oil system was built and operating the measurements were performed in order to

hek the ompensated (cid:28)eld. The tables for the PMTs have in total 64 holes. The (cid:28)eld at the enter

of eah hole has been measured. Fig.6 shows the results of measurements with the ompensated

(cid:28)eld. One an see that the developed oils system ompensates the EMF at the level of 1.5 µT

for the north-south omponent (FCMS), and 5 µT for the vertial omponent (non standard
Helmholtz system of square oils). The value of 8.5 µT is measured for the non-ompensated

east-west omponent. The expeted PMT signal degradation due to the residual EMF is less than

5% [5℄.

2.2 Eletronis

One hannel of eletronis (out of the total 32) of the test faility is presented in Fig.7. The

system uses the modular CAMAC standard eletronis and is onneted to a personal omputer

by a CAEN C111 interfae.

As it was already pointed out, the test system operates only on one of 4 groups of PMTs at

the same time. The logi of the hannels multiplexing is shown in Fig.8. The swith between the

groups is performed writing the orresponding mask into the multiplexer internal register. The

Quad linear FAN-IN/OUT (Philips Mod.740) is onneted as analog signals summator. The signal

is ampli(cid:28)ed before multiplexing in order to preserve the signal-to-noise ratio. After splitting the

signals are proessed by a LeCroy Mod.4413 Leading Edge Disriminator (LED) with a threshold

set at the level of 0.05 − 0.10 p.e., just above the level of the noise. If the PMT in the urrent

hannel is too noisy, the hannel is disabled by writing the orresponding mask into the internal

register of the LED, in suh a way avoiding the in(cid:29)uene of the elevated ount rate in one hannel

on others. The signals formed by the LED are fed into the LeCroy Mod.4532 Ma jority Logi Unit

(MALU). If at least one signal from the total 32 ours inside the external gate, the output signal is

generated and the LAM signal is ativated by the MALU. The laser trigger is used as the ma jority

external gate.

The Orte Mod.CCF8200 Constant Fration Disriminator (CCF) was used for the measure-

ments of the timing harateristis with the threshold set at the 0.2 p.e. level. The formed signals

are delayed and split on the Digital Delay (LeCroy Mod.4518/300) and then fed into the CAEN

Mod.C414 Time-to-Digital-Converter (TDC), the LeCroy Mod.2277 Multihit TDC (MTDC) and

the Saler (LeCroy Mod.4434). The original signal delayed on the Delay Line is fed into the

LeCroy Mod.2249A Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC (cid:16)gate(cid:17) and the TDC/MTDC

(cid:16)start(cid:17) signals are generated using the laser internal trigger, whih has a negligible time jitter

(< 100 ps) with respet to the light pulse.

The MALU is able to memorize the pattern of the hit hannels. This information signi(cid:28)antly

inreases the data proessing rate. The read-out of the eletronis is ativated when the ma jority

LAM signal is on. Otherwise, a hardware lear is fored 400 ns after the laser trigger, using the

ma jority OUT signal.

Two modes of operation were used in our tests. In the (cid:28)rst one, the system is triggered at the

(cid:28)rst trigger from the laser that ours when the eletronis is not busy proessing the previous

event. This was realized by onneting the last (32-nd) ma jority input to the external gate signal.

This mode of operation has been used in the test of the PMTs. An example of the data aquired

during a routine PMT test is presented in Fig.9.

Another mode of operation has been used during the HV tuning. In this ase the 32-nd input

of the MALU was disabled. The eletronis read-out was ativated as before by the MALU LAM

signal, but for this time at least one signal from PMT over the LED threshold must be present to

ativate the MALU. In suh a way the (cid:16)ut(cid:17) harge histograms have been aquired with a hardware

threshold of about 5% − 10% of the (cid:16)typial(cid:17) Single Photoeletron Response (SER) mean value.

The afterpulses are registered by the MTDC whih is able to reord in the internal register up

to 16 sequential hits inside a 32 µs window for eah of its 32 hannels. The laser repetition rate
was tuned to 30 µs, so the peak orresponding to this time an be learly seen at the afterpulses

histogram. The intensity of this peak was used to monitor the intensity of the laser. The probability

of two sequential nonzero PMT signals, in the assumption of the Poisson distribution of the number

of deteted photoeletrons, is given by:

for µ ≪ 1, where N2 is number of events in the seond peak and N1 - number of events in the

(cid:28)rst peak (or the total number of the system triggers in our ase). The time of arrival of the (cid:28)rst

pulse was tuned to have it just after the MTDC start signal, so the MTDC ounts the number of

its triggers.

The high preision alibration of eah eletronis hannel was performed before the measure-

system input with the ADC pedestal subtrated (the PMT in this measurement was substituted

by a preision harge generator LeCroy 1976). The position of the ADC pedestals are de(cid:28)ned and

heked during the run.

2.3 High voltage supplies

Two types of high voltage supplies were used to provide HV to the PMTs. The CAEN mainframe

mod. SY403, with 4 mod. A505 boards (3 kV, 200 µA) of 16 hannels eah, was used to provide

HV for the PMTs in the dark room. This model has very low r.f. noise and provides the possibility

to hek the urrent on eah hannel, whih was very important during the (cid:28)rst test of the PMTs.

The HV for the TLTT and three Water Tanks were provided by the Universal Multihannel

Power Supply System CAEN mod. SY527, where the mainframe hosts 5 mod. A932AP boards

(2.5 kV, 500 µA) of 24 hannels eah. These modules have muh higher r.f. noise and do not

provide the possibility of the read-out of the individual hannel urrent; only the urrent of the

primary hannel providing power for 24 hannels an be heked.

The modules are remotely ontrolled through the CAEN mod. C117B H.S. CAENET CAMAC

Controller Interfae and the H.S. CAENET serial link and protool. Two mainframes (SY403 and

SY527) are onneted in series.

2.4 Redution of the r.f. noise and stabilization of the system

PMTs with a large area photoathode are very sensitive to environmental radio-frequeny noise.

The PMTs tested for the CTF detetor were sealed in a plasti water-proof ontainer; in order to

redue the indued noise, the PMTs were wrapped in aluminum foil before testing. The PMTs

prepared for Borexino were sealed in a metalli ylindri ontainer. Tests showed the dependene of

the noise amplitude on the width of the gap between the internal aluminum sreen and the edge of

the metalli ylinder. This noise had a smaller amplitude in omparison to the non-proteted PMTs

of the CTF and no speial measures were needed in oder to operate the PMT at the aeptable

level of the r.f. noise.

All the abling was performed with are in order to avoid ground loops. During the exploitation

of the system another soure of r.f. noise was identi(cid:28)ed. This noise was originating from the (cid:29)at

ables, onneting the personal omputer with the CAMAC rate. In the following the able has

been wrapped in aluminum foil, one end was grounded and the other one left in the air.

The eletronis room was equipped with an air onditioning system. Nevertheless, a slow

drift of the ADC pedestals was observed during the long runs. In oder to ompensate the slow

variations of the pedestal position, it was automatially heked every 30 minutes and in the ase

a statistially signi(cid:28)ant drift was measured, a software ompensation was introdued.

2.5 Optial system

The PMTs are illuminated by low intensity light pulses from a pioseond Hamamatsu Photonis

K.K. pulse laser, model PLP-02, equipped with the laser diode head SLDH-041. The model has

a peak power of 0.39 mW , the pulse width (FWHM) is less than 30 ps, and the emitted light

of 410 nm wavelength is lose to the maximum sensitivity of the ETL 9351 photoathode. The

pulsing voltage supply of the laser provides the internal trigger, whih has a negligible time jitter

(< 100 ps) with respet to the light pulse. The laser head is mounted on a standard optial benh

together with the other elements, and is enlosed in a light tight plasti box painted blak inside

(see Fig.10). The able feed-throughs are light-tight as well, whih is preventing the pik up of the

ambient light by the opti (cid:28)ber.

The light spot from the laser is interepted by a supporting struture designed to hold a set of

neutral density (cid:28)lters that an easily be hanged or removed. An optial lens has been plaed after

the (cid:28)lters to fous and reshape the laser spot; it an be aligned in three independent diretions by

means of the mirometri regulators. The laser spot is foused on the lad road, the support of the

latter an be regulated in two independent diretions. The optial devie has a high aeptane

and is espeially designed to launh the pulse in a glass (cid:28)ber of 600 µm ore and 2 m length. The

glass (cid:28)ber is terminated by an ST onnetor whih is oupled in the same way to a bunh of optial

(cid:28)bers, of 100 µm ore and 2 m length that (cid:28)t inside the glass (cid:28)ber spot. An optial grease is used

to redue the transmission losses and re(cid:29)etions. All 12 outputs are terminated through ST path

panel onnetors that go out of the blak box to deliver light into the dark-room, to the WTs and

to the TLTT.

As regards the dark room, there are 4 (cid:28)bers (12 m long) that, starting from the blak box,

arrive over the 4 tables in the dark room. Eah (cid:28)ber of the dark room and WT is supplied with

a di(cid:27)using beam probe with opal di(cid:27)user in order to provide a more uniform illumination of the

table, loated at the minimum distane of 1.5 m from the (cid:28)ber termination. The di(cid:27)user has been

espeially studied and designed.

In view of the measurements of the relative PMT sensitivity the tables were alibrated with a

probe PMT, plaed in turn at every position. The illumination of the tables follows approximately

the 1/r2

law, where r is the distane between the PMT plae and the di(cid:27)user. The sensitivity of

eah PMT was de(cid:28)ned during the tests with respet to the alibration measurement. The values

obtained should be onsidered as indiative and have no diret use for the detetor desription for

a number of reasons, namely:

• the PMTs are sensitive to the residual EMF, but the orientation of the PMT in respet to

• a di(cid:27)erent sheme of the EMF ompensation was hosen for Borexino, where the PMTs are

the probe was randomly hosen;

sreened by means of a µ-metal;

• beause of the di(cid:27)erenes in the amplitude spetra, the same CFD setting an leave di(cid:27)erent

part of the signals under the threshold. Moreover, the eletronis of Borexino will be dif-

ferent from those used in the test faility, whih makes it impossible to adjust preisely the

Relative sensitivity

omparison with the ETL provided measurements of the photoathode quantum e(cid:30)ieny at 420

The relative sensitivity of the PMTs an be easily de(cid:28)ned during the operation of the detetor

using events uniformly distributed over the detetor's volume, i.g.

14C β -deay events.

The relative sensitivity of the PMTs measured in the test faility is shown in Fig. 11 in

omparison with the ETL provided measurements of the photoathode quantum e(cid:30)ieny at

420 nm (the values for eah histogram are divided by their mean in order to make omparison

evident). The measured relative sensitivity has bigger variations with respet to those of the

quantum e(cid:30)ieny.

2.6 Test proedure

Before the installation in the test faility the PMTs were labelled. 60 PMTs were tested in one

yle of operation. The PMTs were installed in the test faility in random positions on the test

tables and with random orientations of the dynodes plane. No speial measures were undertaken

in order to prevent the illumination of the photoathodes before settling them on the test tables.

After leaving the PMTs in the dark for a ouple of hours, the nominal voltage provided by the

manufaturer was applied to the PMTs and the dark rate heked. In the ase of a PMT with a

17

too high dark rate, the voltage has been dereased in order to ensure stable dark ount rate at the

level of less than 50 Kps, and in addition the PMT was left under dark onditions for a longer

period of time (up to one week).

At the beginning of the test the expeted urrent was alulated using the known resistane

of the high voltage divider and the operating high voltage. If the deviation from the alulated

value did not fall in the (cid:28)duial interval, the PMT was examined more thoroughly. After these

preparative stages, the high voltage adjustment started as desribed below (setion 3). After

the HV tuning (cid:28)nished, the PMTs dark rates and urrents were heked one more. The PMTs

still showing any kind of problem were exluded from the urrent test, left under lower HV and

reexamined after a ouple of days.

2.7 Software

A speial data aquisition (DAQ) and analysis software have been developed for the test system.

The kernel of the DAQ program was developed in 1992-1993 using Borland Turbo-C 3.0 under the

MS-DOS operating system with a omputer on the base of an Intel 486 proessor. Following the

rapid development of the omputers, the program was adjusted to math more powerful proessors,

and in its present state the data aquisition speed is limited only by the hardware used. Now the

program is running in the MS-DOS emulator under a Linux system.

The program provides ontrol over all CAMAC settings of the eletronis (delays, thresholds,

signals width et) and high voltage supplies. The program allows to speify the time period to

save histograms on disk, the time period to hek the pedestal positions, the time period to hek

PMT urrents and high voltages, and the time period to hek the dark rate. The period of data

taking was de(cid:28)ned either by setting the maximum number of events to be aquired, or by setting

the run time. The program provides also the possibility of the automati swithing to the next

group of PMTs, after the aquisition with the urrent group is (cid:28)nished.

The ADC pedestals are de(cid:28)ned at the beginning of eah spei(cid:28)ed period and, if a shift of

the position is found, the appropriate orretion is applied to the measured harges. In this way

the low-frequeny drift of the pedestal (mainly due to the small daily temperature variations) is

ompensated.

32 hannels.

The PMT urrents are heked every spei(cid:28)ed time period and, if the urrent is too high, the

orresponding PMT is swithed o(cid:27) automatially.

In the (cid:16)pmt aeptane test(cid:17) the data is aquired in the form of 3 histograms of 1024 bins

eah: the harge spetrum (ADC), the time of arrival of the response (TDC)

, and the afterpulse

8

spetrum up to 32 µs (MTDC). The mean aquisition rate is about 1000 events per seond with

The DAQ program an be run in a (cid:16)pmt gain tuning(cid:17) mode. The operation in this mode is

desribed in more detail in the following setion.

8

The full sale of TDC was set to 200 ns with 4096 hannel resolution. Beause of the memory restritions of

the software, only part of the full range is mapped to the histogram, spei(cid:28)ally 100 ns in the region [-30 ns;+70

ns℄ around the main peak in the PMT transit time, with 1024 hannel resolution.

18

In the (cid:16)dst(cid:17) mode of operation the data is written in a (cid:28)le after eah event, allowing to study

orrelations in the data. This mode has been used in the opti (cid:28)bers test [13℄.

The analysis software was developed on the base of the CERN ROOT libraries under a Linux

system [22℄. The program automatially analyses the harge spetrum, the transit time spetrum,

and the spetrum of the ioni afterpulses and then plots all the data in the test sheet (see Fig.9

for an example). All numerial data is inserted in a database immediately.

3 Eletron multiplier gain measurements and operating volt-

age setting

3.1 Brief desription of the algorithm used

For the HV tuning it is neessary to provide a robust method of gain measurement. A method of

photomultiplier alibration with high preision of up to a few perent has been disussed in [23℄.

The method is based on preision measurements of the PMT harge response to low intensity light

pulses from a laser. It has been onluded that the preision of the method is limited only by the

systemati errors in the disrimination of the small amplitude pulses from the eletronis noise.

On the basis of our experiene with the preise PMT alibration [23℄, a fast proedure of PMT

voltage tuning has been realized for the Borexino PMT test faility [24℄.

The goal of the tuning is to (cid:28)nd the HV value that will provide an eletron gain fator k = 2·107
for eah PMT. The mean value of the harge single eletron response (SER), q1 , is determined,

and the HV is adjusted so that q1 agrees with a alibration value c1 = 1.6 pC to a prede(cid:28)ned
preision. In [24℄ was shown that for small µ one an use the following approximation for q1 :

q1 = qm

1 − µ
1 − pt

2 − pt
thr
2

,

where qm is the mean value of the ut distribution (a software ut of 15% of c1 is used in order

to avoid the e(cid:27)ets of the SER shape distortion near the hardware threshold);

µ is the mean p.e. number registered for one laser pulse;
pt is the part of the harge SER under the threshold. For the 15% software threshold, the value

pt ∼= 0.11 was used, de(cid:28)ned during the tests of the 100 PMTs for the CTF;
thr is the threshold level measured in units of c1 (0.15 in the our ase).

The mean p.e. number is de(cid:28)ned during the test by estimating the probability of two sequential

non-zero signals on PMT. Assuming a Poisson distribution of the light detetion proess, one an

write:

µ = − ln(1 −

where NT rigger is the the full number of the system triggers and Nev is the number of events

that are followed by the non-zero pulse (the (cid:28)rst signal in a two pulses sequene is triggering the

system and thus is always present). In pratie, we take as NT rigger the number of the events in the

The relative variation of the gain versus the variation of the applied voltage was de(cid:28)ned in [24℄,

,

with a onstant fator n ≃ 3.5. UD1 = 600 V is the voltage di(cid:27)erene between the (cid:28)rst dynode
and the photoathode, the stability of UD1 is provided by 3 Zener diodes of 200 V eah (see Fig.1).

The HV orretion in the automated system is alulated in the following way. If the deviation

is bigger than 10% the orretion is set to a fration of the maximum deviation of 100 V in
proportion : ( q1−c1
c1 ) to the deviation from the alibration value. The value of 100 V is used, so that

any possible over-voltage is avoided. For smaller deviations from the alibration the orretion an

be alulated more preisely from (4), namely:

3.2 Results of operating voltage tuning

The algorithm is su(cid:30)iently fast; for 30 PMTs at 1 Kps aquisition rate the HV is adjusted in

15-20 minutes with 2% statistial preision.

The results of the HV tuning with the preision set to 2% are presented in Fig.12. These

9

30 µs orresponds to the laser repetition rate of 33 kHz. The laser repetition rate is (cid:28)xed in the measurements

at this value.

Figure 13: Operating high voltage for 2000 PMTs

results were obtained during the high preision tests after the HV adjustment. The mean value of

k agrees with the expeted k = 2.0 × 107

. Statistis for the operating voltage is shown in Fig.13.

The systemati error of the method is onneted mainly with the substitution of the parameter

pt by its mean value pt = 0.11, the error aused by the preision of µ estimation is negligible. The
measured variane of the pt parameter is σpt = 0.018 [24℄. As follows from the formula (2) the
ontribution of the systemati error is equal to σpt . Summing quadratially the systemati (0.018)
and the statistial (0.02) errors one will obtain the full error of σ ≃ 0.027. The variane of the

gain distribution (0.028) agrees with the alulated value.

The method is not based on any spei(cid:28) single photoeletron spetrum model and hene an

be used for the gain adjustment of the PMT with an arbitrary single eletron response. Other

advantages of the method are the simpliity of alulations, the preditable preision and very

high speed of the algorithm. The method an be adapted for use with any type of PMT designed

to operate in single eletron regime.

4 Database

The PostgreSQL [25℄ database was prepared and (cid:28)lled with the data obtained during the tests.

The data provided by the manufaturer (ETL) were put in another table of the same database,

giving the possibility of easy aess to the data. the omplete desription of all database entries

is desribed in [26℄. The main parameters put in the database are presented in Tables 4-6. These

are mainly the parameters obtained diretly in the test or after the proessing of the data. For the

desription of the PMT harge spetrum the phenomenologial model of the PMT harge spetrum

was used as desribed in [23℄, an example of the (cid:28)t is presented in Fig.9. Complete information

on the measured parameters will be provided elsewhere [28℄.

5 Conluding remarks

The main task of the test system was the aeptane test of the Borexino PMTs. The system

proved to be very e(cid:30)ient, 2350 PMTs delivered from the manufaturer were tested in 4 months of

ontinuous system operation. The results of the test were analyzed and will be reported elsewhere

[28℄. Eletronis and software of the test system have been used also in the Borexino Muon Veto

PMTs test; in Borexino light (cid:28)bers tests [13℄; in testing of 120 PMTs for the upgrade of the CTF

detetor; in the harge spetrum study of the PMT [23℄; in time harateristis high preision

study of ETL9351 type PMT [27℄; and in the study of the sensitivity of the PMT to the Earth

magneti (cid:28)eld [21℄.

Abstract

Suspensions of superheated superconducting grains are a detecting composite ma-
terial. Each grain in the supension is a microcalorimeter with an energy threshold
deﬁned by its equatorial magnetic ﬁeld for a given temperature. The higher the
matrix density, the larger the gamma stopping power. For several years, cylindrical
cells of such suspensions about 2 cm long and 0.4 mm in diameter can be read out in
real time. As a result, using two independent cells, one can record a time coincidence
between them. This could be potentially very useful for positron cameras where two
diametrically opposite cells are simultaneously knocked by 511 keV gammas. This
paper, based on the state of art in SSG in high density matrix, discusses such a
feasibility.

1 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Suspensions of Su-
perheated Superconducting Grains in High Density Matrix

Superheated superconducting grains detectors (SSG) are made from a suspen-
sion of microspheres of type I superconductor. Kept at a temperature lower
than the superconducting critical one and in a DC magnetic ﬁeld larger than
the thermodynamical critical value at that temperature, each grain remains in
a superconducting state, which is indeed a superheated superconducting state
(this is not valid for a bulk superconductor because of surface defects acting as
permanent nucleation centers). This superheated state can be broken down,
either by ramping up the magnetic ﬁeld, or by heating the microsphere (by
energy deposition). In both cases, the perfect diamagnetism associated with
the superconducting state disappears suddenly. The resulting local magnetic
ﬂux variation can be detected in real time by a pick-up coil surrounding the
whole suspension. Although good type I superconductors are : Al, Zn, Ga, Ge,
Cd, In, Sn, Hg,Tl, the most commonly used metal is tin because of its charac-
teristic values for the superconducting state: Tc = 3.72K just below the 4, 2K
for liquid helium under atmospheric pressure, Hc(0) (at zero K) =302 Gauss
Hsh(0) =600 Gauss. Low temperature techniques are no more a problem in
medical environment: MRI magnets are immersed in tens of litres of liquid
helium and on the other hand pulse tube system can provide liquid helium
in closed loop systems. Non toxicity and friendly metallurgy of microspheres
are secondary reasons for that choice. Usually the microspheres are randomly
but homogeneously dispersed in paraﬃn wax (reference [1]). As a result such
a suspension has a low stopping power for 511 keV gamma since the ﬁlling
factor in tin grains cannot be larger than 0.1 to avoid percolation between
grains. For positron camera, it is possible to replace wax by litharge (PbO),
the composite of tin grains and PbO is therefore a suspension of SSG in High
Density Dielectric Matrix (HDDM). Because of the presence of high Z ele-
ment in such a composite one has to take into account not only the ionization
process but also the photoelectric eﬀect under 511 keV irradiation. In recent
years the sensitivity of the sudden ﬂux change read-out has been enhanced
with the use of a preampliﬁer with an HEMFET input stage (reference [2])
cooled in liquid helium. We assume throughout this paper that the sensitivity
of the preampliﬁer is high enough to read a single grain larger than 10µm
in diameter in the pixel deﬁned below or in an equivalent volume. For the
following :

1- We recall the basics physics of SSG.
2- We describe the detecting system with SSG-HDDM, with its main parame-
ters, technical limitations and constraints limiting ourselves to a single cell
of the previous system.

3- Using GEANT (reference [3]) simulation program we study its behavior
under 511keV irradiation. These results allow us to estimate the read-out

2

performance under positron irradiation.

4- Finally we discuss the requirements for a completion of such a system.

Fig. 1. Phase diagram

In a phase diagram (T, H) (reference [4] page 2, see ﬁgure1) one grain of
the suspension can be represented by one point (Hlocal, Tbath). Tbath is the
bath temperature in which the suspension is immersed. Hlocal is the value
of the magnetic ﬁeld at the equator of the grain or its surface maximum if
the grain is not perfectly spherical. Hlocal is diﬀerent from Happlied because
of diamagnetic interactions between grains. Diamagnetism is the magnetic
ﬁeld expulsion from the volume of the superconducting material (here the
grain), as a result from grain to grain there are ﬁeld variations induced by
these magnetic ﬂux expulsions. Therefore in the phase diagram a suspension
of grains at a given temperature Tbath is represented by a set of points along
the vertical line T=Tbath. If these grains are numerous, the suspension can
be represented by a vertical segment : each point of this segment represents
one grain and only one. There are two main paths for a grain to undergo a
change of state : either by heating or by magnetic ﬁeld ramping up. Heating
can be produced by energy deposition, if enough energy is deposited one has a
thermal nucleation mechanism. In the case of magnetic ﬁeld ramping up one

3

speaks of magnetic nucleation. It is the distance from the representative point
in the phase diagram to the superheated border which deﬁnes the amount of
energy necessary for thermal nucleation. It has been demonstrated that the
heating of a superheated grain under energy deposition is, after a very short
time, (10−10-10−12 second), homogeneous.

In principle, since the diamagnetic interactions between microspheres are long
range interactions, each transition of a microsphere to the normal (resistive
state) modiﬁes the magnetic ﬁeld sensed by each grain of the suspension.
However, if only a small fraction of the grains undergo a transition one can
safely consider in ﬁrst approximation that these modiﬁcations are negligible.
It is only when a large fraction of the grains have changed state that one
must take into account the modiﬁcation of diamagnetic interactions. This
problem has been analytically solved by Geigenm¨uller and Mazur (reference
[5]): given the geometrical positions of the remaining superconducting grains,
the magnetic ﬁeld at the equator of each of them is computable (reference [6]).
More recently it has been discussed by Pe˜naranda et al (reference [7]).

2.2 Geometry of a single pixel

As a starting point to evaluate which kind of beneﬁt one could expect from
such a system as a positron camera, we take the most conservative parameters
for the elementary cell :

Geometry: a cylinder 0.78 cm long ; 0.4 cm in diameter
Temperature: about 200mK
Magnetic Field: Hc (0,2K)= 300 Gauss, Hsh (0,2K)= 600 Gauss.

It is assumed that each cell is a suspension with a ﬁlling factor of 0.1 for tin
microspheres of respectively 7, 8 or 10µm diameter. For larger ﬁlling factor
contacts or quasi contacts between grains create strong diamagnetic interac-
tions resulting in local ﬁelds stronger than the theoretical superheated critical
magnetic ﬁeld : the grains are no longer superconducting. The energy loss of
the particle being proportional to the radius of the microsphere of the tra-
jectory, and the heating of the microsphere proportional to the inverse of the
cubic of radius, the heating decreases inversely to the square of the radius.
The energy thresholds decrease with the radius of the microsphere.

Due to the modularity of the system, we can take one of these cells to simulate
the behaviour under 511 keV irradiation of the full detector. Our tool for
simulation is GEANT 321 (reference [3]. This program takes into account
all the possible interactions of an impinging photon on the cell: ionisation
and radiation including secondary eﬀects. It is a step by step simulation: the
trajectory of the particle is incremented step by step in a minute quantity

4

depending on one hand on the particle nature, lifetime and momentum, and
on the other hand on the crossed media (chemical composition, density and
surrounding boundaries). To simulate the whole pixel needs too much memory
space, therefore we consider a fraction of it along the irradiation axis and a
diameter of 0.1 cm. GEANT is unable to deal at once with such a large number
of grains; therefore, along the axis we divide the cylinder into sub cylinders.
The ﬁnal simulation represents a volume of 8 mm3. In GEANT one is free to
choose the minimum step: it has been taken here as a fraction of a micrometer.
For each step GEANT gives the energy loss in that step, the eventual gamma
interaction, the deposited energy per grain and ﬁnally the number of crossed
granules with energy deposition.

Fig. 2. Geometry of simulation

The gamma beam is parallel to the cylinder axis, arbitrarily chosen as the Z
axis (2). 105 photons are sent onto the detector which is a suspension of mono-
sized tin microspheres either 7, 8, or 10 µm in diameter, representing 10% of
the volume cylinder. The microspheres are immersed in a high density matrix
made of litharge (Pb0, density =9.35). Such a detector irradiated by 511keV
gammas has a stopping power of about 37% : Simulation gives that out of 100
000 photons impinging on the cylinder, 36713 interact by electron production
either by Compton or by photoelectric eﬀect. As we will see the energy depo-
sition in both processes occurs in the vicinity of the spot of materialisation of
the impinging photon.

3.1 Distribution of the interaction points:

Figure 3 represents the projections (X and Y) on a diametrical plane of the in-
teraction spot of each interacting gamma in the whole cylinder. The aperture
of the gamma beam is reduced to 10µm around the Z axis. In this representa-
tion one does not care if the interaction takes place in a microsphere or in the
matrix. One can see that the diameter of the virtual volume is large enough
to include all the diﬀused events.

Fig. 4. Number of crossed grains versus the depth Z: the number of grains does not
depend of Z

As long as the photon does not interact with the pixel there is no energy depo-
sition. This deposition takes place only along the secondary trajectories. The
energy loss useful for read-out of a photon impact occurs only in the grains.
We reserve the denomination ”crossed grains” or ” crossed microspheres” to
these speciﬁc microspheres in which there is an energy deposition. Figure 4
represents the number of crossed grains per incoming photon as a function of
the depth Z in the cylinder. As expected, since the mean free path of electrons
is shorter than the mean free path for photons one can see that the number of
crossed granules is depth independent of the photon impact. As a result, the

6

energy loss after a photon interaction is independent of the point where it has
occurred.

Fig. 5. Number of grains hit versus the whole energy deposition in the cell (in the
litharge and in the grains)

This distribution is represented in ﬁgure 5 which gives the fraction of concerned
grains for a given range of deposited energy by an impinging electron. At this
stage we have a full description of the deposited energies in the suspension.
So far we have not used the superconducting state properties. Now we have
to estimate the response of the superheated superconducting system to this
distribution of deposited energy.

3.4 Response of superheated superconducting microspheres to an energy de-

position

For the purpose of the feasibility study it is enough to limit ourselves to
a small number of crossed grains thus representing a tiny fraction of their
overall number. In principle, for each change of state of a grain, because of the
long range diamagnetic interaction, the whole set of maxima of the equatorial
magnetic ﬁeld is changed. However, when only a small number of grains are
undergoing a transition one can assume that the distribution of maxima of
the equatorial magnetic ﬁeld remains the same.

As a result the simulation relies on two quantities which, in ﬁrst approximation
are taken as independent stochastic phenomena:

(the impact point is not a relevant parameter because the energy deposition
if large enough always creates an homogeneous nucleation : there is a uniform
and global heating of each ﬂipped grain ( ﬂipped = crossed grains that will
change state)). In other terms the distribution of deposited energies among
crossed grains is convoluted with the distribution of their equatorial magnetic
ﬁeld.

Fig. 7. Energy deposition in the grains versus ∆Hmax. Incidently for each Tbath this
gives the correspondence between ∆H in gauss and “∆H ” in eV.

Figure 7 (reference [4] page 82) shows the ∆Hmax in function of the density of
energy deposition in the grain, for three diﬀerent temperatures. If we multiply

8

this density by the volume of the microsphere (the grain) we get for a given
temperature, and a certain energy deposition, the range of ∆H, that we can
randomly choose between 0 and ∆Hmax.

Thus we obtain as a function of the impinging photon energy the intrinsic
eﬃciency of the pixel (ﬁgures 8,9 and 10 ) assuming that at H applied 20%
of the grains are already ﬂipped to the normal state and that in the interval
[Happlied, Happlied+∆Hmax] the number of grains per unit of ∆H is constant.

In fact, on ﬁgures 8, 9 and 10 for a given suspension three eﬃciencies have been
drawn as a function of the impinging gamma respectively corresponding to the
simultaneous ﬂipping of 1, 2 or 3 grains. 3 diﬀerent radius of grains has been
used, 10µm, 8µm, 7µm. Four diﬀerent ∆H were used, 1 eV, 5 eV, 10 eV, and
20 eV per µm3. As expected the resulting curves are strikingly diﬀerent and
lead us to consider that the event selection can be based not only on energy

selection by magnetic ﬁeld monitoring which is conventional in SSG systems
but, in that case can be combined with signal amplitude selection. This opens
a wide range of conﬁguration for PET. To appreciate the potentialities of a
SSG PET let us consider the classical case of a small animal camera. The
present state of art of the electronic read-out allows us to read 1 grain of 10
µm radius or 2 grains of 8 µm radius. 5 eV of ∆H is assumed. ∆Hmax of 5
eV per cubic micron is a good compromise, allowing to work with reasonable
temperature (between 200 and 500 mK, see ﬁgure 7) and precision (5 keV per
µm3 ) correspond to an energy loss of 20 keV in grain of 10 µm radius, see
ﬁgure 6). We can for example estimate the electronic eﬃciency of the system
at 511 keV:

for 10 µm: 0.534
for 8 µm: 0.380

4 Performance required for a small animal PET

The PET requirements were discussed among others by Huber et al ([8]).
One considers a mouse phantom of 29g placed in the centre of a 20 cm long
cylinder, 5 cm in diameter made of two closed compact layers of elementary
cylindrical pixels as discussed above (see ﬁgure 11).

Monte Carlo simulation gives a materialization eﬃciency (Table 1 ) to 511 Kev
irradiation of the order of 42% in a pixel. This eﬃciency can be higher if one

increases the depth of the detecting layer. This is possible because, contrary to
classical techniques neither the read-out electronics nor the detecting material
are limiting factors for an eﬃcient design of the whole system.

The energy deposited in the pixel comes from either a straight gamma (signal)
or from a diﬀused trajectory in the mouse phantom (noise). Figure 12 gives
the distribution of the deposited energy for the straights and the diﬀused pho-
tons. The eﬃciency given by ﬁg 7 allows an estimation of the noise equivalent
counting rate (NECR) which is the ratio of interest for PET performances. For
its estimation we follow conventional notations. The true (T rue) coincidental

The Noise Equivalent Count Rate (NECR) is the number of counts detected
as a function of the activity concentration, after correcting the eﬀects of ran-
dom and scatter events taking into account dead-time losses. It is a standard
measure of signal to noise in reconstructed PET images.

k is a correction factor for random coincidences (k=1 or 2).

To illuminate the possibilities of SSG HDM PET two diﬀerent grains suspen-
sions and corresponding electronic tuning are considered: the ﬁrst one with
10µm radius tin grains and with an electronic threshold corresponding to the
magnetic ﬂux penetration in one grain, the second with 8µm radius tin grains.
We presume working at a temperature (between 200 and 500 mK) allowing a
∆Hmax of 5 eV. With an electronic threshold corresponding to two simulta-
neously ﬂipping grains, the performance for each situation is given below for
106 events, by the following numbers presented in Table 2:

If we suppress the phantom and the depth of the vessel, we get 384990 gamma’s
directly in our system. Of these 384990, 367770 are on the 511keV as entry en-
ergy. In the system with phantom and vessel, we get 267670 photons with 511
keV. But, in reality, a large fraction of photons give a signal in the same angle
as the direct photons. We consider the threshold angle for diﬀused gammas as
0.234 radians.

The probability of escape P can be evaluated to 0.7281.
The probability of direct impact is 0.8793.
The solid angle of our system is for 20 cm of length of the detector and 5 cm
of radius:

The gamma materialization factor is
m = 0.367770/0.9=0.419
This gives:
For a radius of 10 µm, ǫ = 0.419*0.534=0.2036
For a radius of 8 µm, ǫ = 0.419*0.380=0.1520

Table 3
NECR according to the intensity of the source (106, 107 and 108 Becquerel), and
to the radius of the grains, given in counts per second and percentage of the whole
counting rate.

The number of diﬀused, Scatter, is 3. 105 and 0.7 105 respectively in these
two cases.

The number of random coincidences, Random, is the most important noise:
with such a source of 108, and a window of 10 nanosecond, we get 0.9 106 an
0.54 106 respective of noise.

Improvement of the NECR can be achieved by following paths:

The gt factor can be increased by a new geometry covering a larger solid
angle.
The NECR is proportional to the square of the materialization factor: with
three sheets of detecting rows, we should get an electronic eﬃciency of 0.784
instead of 0.4, this implies a multiplication of the NECR of about 4: this
should give:

NECR= 2.6 106 for 10 µm radius, and NECR= 1.2 106 for 8 µm radius.
Noise reduction is improved with sharper time coincidences: we take 10−8
second.
Increasing electronic eﬃciency can be achieved in more sophisticated recon-
struction taking into account when two cells give a signal.

In usual case, sources of lower intensity are used, in this case we get a more
eﬃcient NECR (Table 3, for 1 sheet of row):

5 Conclusions:

SSG PET is an alternative to classical techniques pushed to their limits. As
often is the case the ﬂexibility of a new solution is repaid by the familiarity with
new techniques, in this case very low temperature cryogenics which have made
signiﬁcant progress toward simplicity and an easy-to-use operation, in the last
ten years. Low temperature and superconductors are already used for medical

16

imaging (MRI magnets). We would underline the fact that SSG PET has no
optical component and no crystal detector. As a result it is open to various
designs in spite of the fact that it must operate at a low temperature. Secondly:
individual pixels at the actual stage of electronics allow high counting rates.
Thirdly : SSG allows energy selection without any numerical treatment : the
monitoring of the magnetic ﬁeld is enough. Although this paper deals with
the feasibility of PET systems for small animals we would like also stress that
the non crystalline nature of the detector allows the realization of pixels with
a volumic fraction at their input in a low density matrix. In that case the
detector is mostly sensitive to soft X ray (in fact it was most often used in
that range of energy). Therefore a combined PET+CT system with the same
geometry and electronics is perfectly feasible.

We would like to thank MM Bonnierbale for his technical help. We would like
to thank M Lallemand, Director of ASCI (Application Scientiﬁque du Calcul
Intensif), for his support and help with the numerical simulations.

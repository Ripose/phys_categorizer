Abstract

The CMS experiment at the LHC includes a hybrid silicon pixel detector for the reconstruction of charged tracks
and of the interaction vertices. The barrel region consists of n-in-n sensors with 100 × 150 µm2 cell size processed
on diﬀusion oxygenated ﬂoat zone silicon. A biasing grid is implemented and pixel isolation is achieved with the
moderated p-spray technique. An extensive test program was carried out on the H2 beam line of the CERN SPS.
In this paper we describe the sensor layout, the beam test setup and the results obtained with both irradiated and
non-irradiated prototype devices. Measurements of charge collection, hit detection eﬃciency, Lorentz angle and
spatial resolution are presented.

1. Introduction

The CMS experiment, currently under construc-
tion at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will in-
clude a silicon pixel detector [1] to allow tracking in
the region closest to the interaction point. The de-
tector will be a key component for reconstructing
interaction vertices and heavy quark decays in a
particularly harsh environment, characterized by a
high track multiplicity and heavy irradiation. The

detector will consist of three barrel layers and two
disks at each end of the barrel. The innermost bar-
rel layer has a radius of 4.3 cm, while for the second
and third layers the radius is of 7.2 cm and 11 cm,
respectively. The layers are composed of modular
detector units. These modules consist of thin, seg-
mented silicon sensors with highly integrated read-
out chips connected by the bump bonding tech-
nique. They are attached to cooling frames, the
cooling tubes being an integral part of the mechan-
ical structure. The minimal pixel size is dictated
by the readout circuit area required for each pixel.

both transverse (rφ) and longitudinal (z) coordi-
nates are important in the barrel region. Therefore
a nearly square pixel shape is preferred. Because
charge is often shared among several pixels, the use
of analogue signal readout enables position inter-
polation improving the spatial resolution. In the
barrel the charge sharing in the rφ-direction will be
large due to the 4 T magnetic ﬁeld of CMS. With
a sensitive detector thickness of 285 µm the pixel
size will be 100 µm and 150 µm along the rφ and
z coordinates, respectively. These value will give
favourable spatial resolution and cluster sizes.

1014 neq/cm2/yr and 0.6

One of the greatest challenges in the design of
the pixel detector is the high radiation level on all
components at very close distances to the colliding
beams. At full LHC luminosity the innermost layer
1014
will be exposed to a particle ﬂuence of 3
neq/cm2/yr 1 , the second and third layer to about
1014 neq/cm2/yr,
1.2
respectively. All components of the pixel system
are speciﬁed to stay operational up to a particle
1014 neq/cm2. This implies
ﬂuence of at least 6
that parts of the detector will have to be replaced
during the lifetime of the experiment. In case of a
possible luminosity upgrade of the LHC the parti-
cle ﬂuence will be even higher. For this reason it is
necessary to test whether the detectors can be op-
erated at ﬂuences above the ones speciﬁed above.
Particle irradiation aﬀects the silicon sensor
response in various ways. It is common practice
to divide radiation damage into surface and bulk
damages. The former includes all eﬀects caused by
ionization in the dielectric covering the structured
sensor surface. Most important is the increase of
charge in the silicon oxide which saturates after
some kGy to values of a few 1012 cm−2. This
changes the electric ﬁeld close to the collecting
electrodes and may lead to electric breakdown. At
higher particle ﬂuences bulk damage, caused by
the interaction of the incident particles with the
silicon lattice atoms, also becomes important. Sil-
icon atoms can be ejected from their lattice sites
leaving vacancies, and the recoil atoms can col-
lide with other lattice atoms. With large enough
recoil energy other atoms are displaced, creat-

loss (NIEL) of 1 MeV neutrons (neq/cm2).

ing more vacancies and interstitials (also called
Frenkel pairs or primary defects). The thermal
energy of the crystal enables some of the simple
defects and defect clusters to migrate through the
lattice and to react with other defects or impuri-
ties (e.g. dopants such as phosphorous and boron
or crystal impurities such as oxygen and carbon).
The formation of complex defects produces new
energy states in the band gap, some of which can
be electrically charged.

There are mainly three macroscopic manifesta-
tions of the defects in reverse biased silicon detec-
tors: An increase of the leakage current, the modi-
ﬁcation of the space charge density and of the drift
ﬁeld across the bulk, and the trapping of charge
carriers.

The increase of leakage current leads to a higher
power dissipation and to a rise of the sensor tem-
perature. Proper cooling is required to prevent a
destructive “thermal runaway” of the device. As
the pixel current is still very small the noise in-
crease is not critical. However, the preampliﬁer
DC-coupled to each pixel must be able to drain the
excess of leakage current. The formation and an-
nealing of the crystal defects show a complex time
behaviour which is strongly temperature depen-
dent. It is advantageous to keep the sensors cooled
to about -10◦C not only during operation but also
during shutdown periods to inhibit reverse anneal-
ing. In addition, it was shown that radiation tol-
erance can be improved by enriching the starting
material with oxygen [2].

Trapping of the mobile carriers from the leak-
age current produces a net positive space charge
density near the p+-backplane and a net negative
space charge density near the n+-implant. Since
positive space charge density corresponds to n-
type doping and negative space charge corresponds
to p-type doping, there are p-n junctions at both
sides of the detector. Consequently, the electric
ﬁeld proﬁle across the bulk varies with an approx-
imately quadratic dependence having a minimum
at the zero of the space charge density and maxima
at both implants [3–10]. The energy levels associ-
ated with the crystal defects are not only ﬁlled by
charge carriers from the generation-recombination
current (leakage current) but also by carriers pro-
duced by traversing particles. If these carriers are

trapped for a time longer than the signal collec-
tion time they do not contribute to particle de-
tection and are de facto lost. Trapping can be re-
duced by collecting electrons instead of holes, be-
cause they have a higher mobility and are less prone
to trapping. In addition, high drift ﬁelds and fast
signal collection can be achieved by increasing the
bias voltage. Signal reduction caused by trapping
presently limits the use of silicon detectors in en-
vironments exposed to ﬂuences higher than 1015
neq/cm2.

The optimization of the CMS barrel pixel sen-
sors was achieved through an extensive comparison
of several technological choices [11–16]. In partic-
ular, pixel sensors with p-spray and p-stop isola-
tion of the collecting electrodes were compared and
the p-spray technique was chosen for the barrel de-
sign [16]. Therefore, only the results obtained with
pixel sensors implementing a p-spray isolation are
discussed hereafter. The purpose of the beam test
program described in this paper was to investigate
several aspects of the sensors response:
– Prove that after a given irradiation ﬂuence the
bias voltage could be adjusted to collect suﬃ-
cient charge. In addition, due to the sparsiﬁed
readout, sensor regions with lower charge col-
lection can lead to detection ineﬃciencies which
may be reduced by design optimization.

– A good spatial resolution must be guaranteed
during operation. In the CMS transverse plane
most tracks are perpendicular to the sensors and
charge is distributed among several pixels by the
Lorentz deﬂection which is aﬀected both by the
applied bias voltage and by irradiation. Along
the longitudinal direction larger impact angles
produce clusters of several pixels and the unho-
mogeneous charge collection caused by trapping
produces asymmetric clusters. Thus, appropri-
ate hit reconstruction techniques have to be de-
veloped to maximize precision.
This paper presents a detailed description of the
sensors for the CMS barrel pixel detector and their
performance. Emphasis is put on highly irradi-
ated sensors. The paper is structured as follows:
A detailed description of the pixel sensors layout
is given in Section 2. Both the ﬁnal and proto-
type sensors used for the tests are discussed. The
samples used for the beam tests are described in

Section 3 and the electrical measurements are pre-
sented in Section 4. The setup developed for the
beam tests is described in Section 5 and the data
reduction discussed in Section 6. The results of the
beam test measurements are presented is Section 7.
Conclusions are presented in Section 8.

2. Sensor Description

2.1. Sensor dimensions and geometry

For the CMS barrel pixel detector two diﬀerent
sensor geometries, the so-called full and half mod-
8
ules are required. The full modules house 2

readout chips. The half modules have only 1
readout chips. Each readout chip contains 52

For the beam test measurements presented in
32 pix-
this paper a special readout chip with 22
125 µm2 was used. Special sensors were
els of 125
designed to match the chip dimensions. The pixel
cell was scaled keeping the gap between the im-
plants constant in order not to change the charge
collection properties of the sensor. All other design
features were kept identical to the ﬁnal sensors.
Therefore it is not expected that the basic proper-
ties other than the spatial resolution diﬀer signiﬁ-
cantly from the ﬁnal barrel sensor design.

2.2. Technological choices

The sensors for the CMS pixel detector adopt
the so called “n-in-n” concept: Pixels consist of
high dose n-implants introduced into a highly re-
sistive n-substrate. The backside of the substrate
is p-doped, therefore the pn-junction is placed on
the backside of the sensor. As the junction must
not extend to the diced edge of the sensor a struc-
tured back side and, consequently, a double-sided
processing of the wafers is mandatory. Additional
precautions have to be taken to suppress the elec-
tron accumulation layer shortening the pixels on
the front side of the sensor. Both considerations
lead to a signiﬁcant cost increase compared to the
single sided “p-in-n” sensors widely used for strip

detectors. However, this concept was chosen for the
following reasons:
– It assures a high signal charge at moderated bias
voltages (< 600 V) after high hadron ﬂuences
(see Sect. 7.4);

– The high mobility of electrons leads to a larger
Lorentz angle, important to reach the required
spatial resolution;

– The need to structure the back side allows to im-
plement a guard ring scheme keeping all sensor
edges at ground potential.

Two inter-pixel isolation techniques were evalu-
ated for the barrel sensors: Open p-stops [17] and
moderated p-spray [18]. The moderated p-spray
technique was eventually chosen because of the su-
perior charge collection properties obtained with
the prototype sensors [19]. The p-spray consists of a
medium dose boron implantation “sprayed” with-
out mask over the whole wafer. Due to the topology
on the wafer surface, the implant is “moderated” in
the region of the lateral pn-junction between pixel
implant and the isolation, as sketched in Fig. 2. The
implantation parameters are adjusted in a way that
in the moderated region the boron dose matches
as close as possible the expected saturation value
of the oxide charge, reached after a few kGy of ion-
ising radiation. Far from the lateral pn-junction
the boron dose reaching the silicon can be roughly
2-3 times larger. This improves the high voltage
stability of the unirradiated devices compared to
a “non-moderated” p-spray [20] while keeping the
good post-radiation behaviour.

i

As ground material n-doped FZ-silicon with
orientation and a resistivity of 3.7 kΩcm was
111
h
used. All wafers for the production of the bar-
rel sensors come from the same silicon ingot to
provide the best possible homogeneity of all ma-
terial parameters. To improve the post radiation
behaviour the wafers undergo a oxygen diﬀusion
process as recommended by the ROSE collabora-
tion [21] resulting in the so-called DOFZ-material.

2.3. Mask layout

the CMS detector will be equipped with pixels of
150 µm length along the beam pipe and 100 µm
width in the polar direction, the tested prototypes
had dimensions of 125

125 µm2.

Most of the pixel area is covered with the collect-
ing electrode formed by the n-implant. The gap be-
tween the n-implants is kept rather small (20 m m)
to provide a homogeneous drift ﬁeld for the signal
charge. On the other hand, this small gap leads to a
relatively high capacitance of the order of 80-100 fF
per pixel which is still compatible with noise re-
quirements. In order to reduce electric ﬁeld peaks
the corners of the implant are rounded.

The so-called bias dot is visible in one corner
of each pixel (Fig. 1). It consists of a circular n-
implant isolated from the pixel implant by a small
gap. It is connected through a contact via to a
circular metal pad. These pads are routed to a
metal line running along every second pixel col-
umn. They form a bias grid which provides a high
resistive punch-through connection to all pixels.
The grid allows on-wafer current-voltage (IV) mea-
surements prior to bump bonding which are per-
formed to detect faulty sensors. In the assembled
module the pixels are grounded by the bump bond
connection to the preampliﬁer (DC-coupling) and
the grid is used to bias accidentally unconnected

4

pixels.

The dark “frame” around the pixel implants vis-
ible in Fig. 2 indicates the opening in the nitride
covering the thermal oxide. In this region the p-
spray dose reaches its maximum. The boron dose
is reduced close to the lateral pn-junction between
the pixel implant and the p-sprayed inter-pixel re-
gion. To increase the punch through voltage the
full p-spray dose is applied between the bias dot
and the pixel implant. This is possible as the gap is
small compared to the gap between the pixels and
both gaps are electrically isolated from each other
another.

The pixel metalization is slightly smaller than
the pixel implant. An overhanging ﬁeld plate could
not be implemented as the metal connection of the
bias grid had to cross the edge of the pixel implant.
The metalisation is connected to the underlying
implant via several contact holes. Since too large
openings might reduce the production yield, their
total area was kept small.

The sensor shown in Fig. 1 has undergone the
bump deposition process including the reﬂow of the
bumps. The bumps are Indium droplets approxi-
mately 25 µm in diameter. Due to their ﬁnite size
they are out of the focus of the microscope.

The active area of the module is surrounded by
a 180 µm wide n-implanted ring to which all metal
lines from the bias grid are connected. This bias
ring can be contacted either by large wire bond
pads in the sensor corner or via a special bump pad
on the readout chip, although this is currently not
foreseen. The region outside this structure spans a

large area n-implant up to the scribe line. It will be
connected to the analogue ground of the readout
chip via a second special bump pad. This connec-
tion ensures that the whole sensor edge is kept at
ground potential and in addition drains the cur-
rent from the guard ring region. In the test samples
investigated during this study this connection was
open and the outer region was ﬂoating. The edge
current was therefore not drained but equally dis-
tributed over all pixels via the bias grid. However,
the noise increase produced by the extra current
ﬂowing into the preampliﬁer was negligible.

The back side of the sensor consists of a large p-
implant forming the junction that depletes the sen-
sor. This p-implant overlaps the sensitive region by
100 m m to provide a homogeneous drift ﬁeld also
in the edge pixels. The metalization is open in al-
most the whole sensitive area apart from the wire
bond pad for the bias voltage, as visible in Fig. 3.
This allows charge injection by a laser.

Fig. 3. Photograph of a sensor attached to the readout
chip. The glue guaranteeing the sample stiﬀness and the
wire bond connections are visible.

The sensor is surrounded by a multiguard ring
structure, shown in Fig. 3, that guarantees a grad-
ual potential drop to the scribe line and prevents
the lateral extension of the space charge region.
It consists on 16 p-implanted guard rings with a
distance increasing from 10 µm in the innermost
ring to 50 µm in the outermost. The aluminisa-
tion of the rings is overhanging in both directions.
A small metal overlap directed toward the scribe

5

line reduces the electric ﬁeld at the implant edge.
A larger overlap toward the device centre increases
the voltage drop between rings [22, 23].

3. Sample preparation

The single chip sensors used in the test beam
measurements (Section 7) were produced in 2002
by CiS, Erfurt, Germany. The deposition of the
under bump metalisation (UBM) and the indium
bumps on wafer was performed at PSI. Then the
wafers were diced and the bumps reﬂown. Some
of the sensors were bump bonded to the readout
chips and glued to support cards.

The treatment of irradiated sensors is more com-
plex. Sensors were irradiated before bump bond-
ing. This was required to study the eﬀects of irra-
diation on sensors only. In addition, the readout
chip used for this study was not suﬃciently radia-
tion hard. The bump deposition and reﬂow involve
temperatures above 120◦ C. To prevent reverse an-
nealing these steps had to be performed before ir-
radiation.

For irradiation the diced sensors were mounted
50 mm2
on the PCBs shown in Fig. 4. These 50
PCBs can safely be transported in slide holders,
thus the fragile bumps are protected. The wire
bond connection to the sensor’s back side easily al-
lows IV-measurements.

removed and attached to the readout chip.

The irradiation has been carried out in 2003 and
2004 at the CERN-PS using 21-24 GeV protons.
The delivered proton ﬂuences scaled to 1 MeV neu-
trons by the hardness factor 0.62 [21] were between
1015 neq/cm2. The irradiation
4.7
was performed without cooling and no bias ap-
plied. After irradiation the samples were stored in
18◦ C and warmed up to room tem-
a freezer at
perature only for handling and transport.

For mating the sensor to the readout chip a spe-
cial procedure without heat treatment was devel-
oped. The mechanical strength of the bump bond
connections usually obtained after a second reﬂow
was achieved by the application of glue (see Fig. 3).
The assembly was then attached to a Kapton card
an the electrical connections were established by
wire bonds. The Kapton cards can be inserted into
the cooled rotating stage of the beam telescope (see
Fig. 6 below).

After ﬁnal assembly the samples underwent an-
nealing of three days at 30◦ C. This was done to
adjust the depletion voltage close to its minimum
according to the Hamburg model for DOFZ mate-
rial [21].

4. Electrical measurements

To assure that the samples were not mechani-
cally damaged during the long and complex prepa-
ration, IV-characteristics were measured before
each important assembly step:

(i) Shortly before irradiation, after mounting
and wire bonding the sample to the support
structure.

(ii) A few days after irradiation, when the sample
was still mounted on the support card.
(iii) After bump bonding and mounting on the

Kapton card.

(iv) During the beam test.
Sensors with obvious damage leading to low break-
down voltage or extremely high leakage current
were excluded from further assembly. The IV-
curves of the sensors used for the measurements
discussed in Section 7 are shown in Fig. 5. The
10◦ C using the tem-
current is normalized to
perature dependence of the volume generation

where T is the absolute temperature, Eg the band
gap in silicon and k the Boltzmann constant. The
temperature was measured using a platinum ther-
mistor (PT100) located close to the sensor. The er-
ror bands visible in Fig. 5 are due to the uncertainty
2◦ C
on the temperature, which was estimated to
for the measurement of the unirradiated sensor and
the data extracted from the test beam slow control
5◦ C for the other measurements. The
system and
temperature diﬀerence between the pixel sensor
and the thermistor for bump bonded devices was
estimated by comparing the sensor leakage current
with and without power applied to the frontend
chip.

The expected leakage current [24] is in the lower
part of the error bands. A factor of about two can
be explained by the extremely large edge area of
the small sensors (the guard current is not drained
separately). The high mechanical stress caused by
the special bump bonding process involving glue
application may also leads to a current increase.

More important than the level of the leakage cur-
rent is the shape of the IV-curve. While the unirra-
diated sensors show a breakdown voltage between
400 V and 600 V, no breakdown is observed after
irradiation. This proves the high radiation toler-
ance of the moderated p-spray technique used for
these devices.

5. Beam test setup

The measurements were performed in the H2
beam line of the CERN SPS in 2003-04 using 150-
225 GeV pions. The test setup was placed in an
open-geometry 3 T Helmoltz magnet producing
a magnetic ﬁeld parallel or perpendicular to the
beam.

5.1. Beam telescope

A silicon reference telescope [25] was used to al-
low a precise determination of the particle hit co-
ordinates in the pixel detector (see Figure 6). The

(1)

telescope modules and the hybrid pixel detector
were mounted on a common frame. The beam tele-
scope consisted of four modules, each including two
orthogonal 300 µm thick single-sided silicon strip
detectors to measure the horizontal and vertical
impact coordinates. The sensors have a strip pitch
of 25 µm, a readout pitch of 50 µm and a total sen-
30 mm2. The intrinsic position
sitive surface of 32
resolution of the beam telescope is about 1 µm [25].

The pixel hybrid detector and the readout card

tion is around the horizontal axis and a precision
of 0.2◦ is achieved. A trigger signal is generated by
a silicon PIN diode placed between the ﬁrst and
second telescope modules. The horizontal and ver-
tical positions of the diode can be adjusted with a
precision of about 100 µm.

5.2. Pixel sensors assembly and cooling

The hybrid pixel sensor is enclosed in a thermo–
isolated plastic box ﬂushed with dry nitrogen to
avoid water condensation. The readout chip is
bump-bonded to the pixel sensor and glued to a
printed circuit board (PCB). The pixel readout
card is connected to the PCB via a short ﬂat cable.
The power consumption of the pixel readout chip
and the readout card is about 20 W. This heat
has to be eﬃciently removed by the cooling sys-
tem. Therefore, two high performance Peltier el-
ements attached to a liquid cooled heat sink are

the Peltier elements is in direct contact with the
coolant liquid, which is circulated by an external
Lauda WKL600 chiller.

The temperature is measured with a PT1000
platinum resistor placed on the PCB and stabilized
by regulating the voltage applied to the Peltier el-
ements. Heat conducting paste is used to improve
the thermal contact between the cold aluminum
plates and the PCB. The sensor resistance is mea-
sured with a Keithley 2000 multimeter and the
temperature can be stabilized down to -35◦ C.

Each pixel cell is read out by a preampliﬁer and a
shaper with a peaking time adjusted to 45 ns.The
readout is enabled when the particle crosses the
PIN diode area and a trigger pulse is sent to the
sample–and–hold (S/H) input of the readout chip.
The active level of the S/H signal disconnects a ca-
pacitor attached to the shaper output and the sig-
nal amplitude is stored in the capacitor. In addi-

the readout of all cells. The analog amplitudes are
digitized by a 12 bits 40 MHz ADC.

The trigger signal is also used to start the read-
out of the beam telescope modules. The charge col-
lected by the strip sensors is ampliﬁed and inte-
grated in a time window of about 2 µs. The signals
are then digitized by two CAEN V550 units con-
trolled by a CAEN V551 sequencer.

The data acquisition (DAQ) software is written
in LabView and LabWindows CVI 2 and runs on
a PC. It controls the VME crate via a National
Instruments PCI interface, the power supplies for
the pixel sensor and the Peltier elements, and the
multimeter for the temperature measurements.

The pixel settings and trigger types can be
changed. The telescope, pixel signal amplitudes
and pedestal values are stored in a data ﬁle. Each

2 LabView and LabWindows/CVI are products of Na-
tional Instruments.

6. Data analysis

6.1. Event selection

The channel noise and pedestal levels are mea-
sured with dedicated random trigger runs taken
during the spill gaps. The signal amplitudes of each
pixel cell is reconstructed with the following pro-
cedure [27]:

(i) Pixel pedestals stored in the data ﬁle are sub-
tracted from the amplitudes cell by cell.
(ii) The amplitudes of six unconnected pixel rows
are averaged and subtracted to reduce com-
mon mode ﬂuctuation.

9

(iii) Hit pixels above threshold (which depends on
the irradiation ﬂuence), are further analyzed.
The threshold is optimized for each sample
and ranges between 35 – 50 ADC counts (cor-
responding to 1000 – 1500 electrons).
(iv) If the hit frequency is below 0.1 times or
above 10 times the expected one, the pixel is
marked as noisy or dead and excluded from
the amplitude reconstruction.

(v) Improved pedestals and common mode val-
ues derived from the good pixels with am-
plitudes below threshold, are calculated and
subtracted from the pixel amplitudes.
Steps (iii), (iv) and (v) are repeated for four itera-
tions. The signal amplitudes of the telescope strip
sensors are reconstructed and corrected in a simi-
lar way.

Events used for the alignment of the pixel de-
tector with the beam telescope are selected. The
selection procedure discards the events with mul-
tiple tracks and tracks which do not ﬁt to straight
lines.

6.2. Alignment of the pixel sensor with the beam
telescope

In each beam telescope plane the position of the
impact point is reconstructed with a center of grav-
ity algorithm for clusters of two adjacent strips.
The main strip in the cluster must have a signal
between 30 and 350 ADC counts and the second
strip is the next neighbour with the highest ampli-
tude. The hit position is then corrected using the
η algorithm described in [28].

The determination of the particle impact posi-
tion in the pixel sensor depends on the track inci-
dent angle α with respect to the pixel plane (see
Fig. 8). For α > 60◦ the hit position is measured
using a center of gravity algorithm. The pixel with
the highest signal above threshold is located and
the surrounding eight pixels are included in the
cluster. The cluster is projected along the two co-
ordinates x and y. The weighted averages of the
hit coordinates x and y are calculated.

For small angles, e.g. α = 15◦, the cluster size
along x is in general larger than three pixels and a
diﬀerent approach is used. The pixel correspond-

ing to the track exit point is deﬁned by the ﬁrst
pixel above threshold along the x axis and with
the highest signal along the y axis. A 3
3 clus-
ter is constructed by including the following two
pixels along the x axis, which are required to be
over threshold, and the corresponding three pixels
in the upper and lower rows along the y axis. The
y coordinate of the cluster is determined with the
center of gravity of the signal collected in the three
x-rows. The x coordinate of the track exit point is
determined using the signal in the three cluster y-
columns. We deﬁne the signals A0, A1, A2 and the
x coordinates x0, x1, x2 of the three pixel columns,
i
respectively. The signal sums Si = P
j=0 Aj with
i = (0, 1, 2) vs. their x coordinates are ﬁtted with
a straight line. The intercept of this line with the
x axis gives the coordinate of the track exit point.
The alignment is performed by minimizing the

respectively, Cxi and Cyi are the ﬁt parameters for

6.3. Gain calibration

A calibration of the readout chain can be per-
formed by injecting a known charge at the input of
the chip preampliﬁer via a 1.7 pF capacitor. The
average signal as a function of the time interval be-
tween the calibration and the trigger pulses is show
in Fig. 9(a). The average signal measured with
straight minimum ionizing tracks and an unirradi-
ated sensor is 710 ADC counts. This implies that
the sampling time of our measurements is about
55 ns. The gain calibration is performed by setting
the delay to this value and measuring the average
signal amplitude as function of the charge injected
in the preampliﬁer (see Fig. 9(b)). The charge re-
leased by a minimum ionizing particle (m.i.p.) is
22400 electrons for a silicon thickness of 285 µm.
The response of the frontend electronics is fairly
linear up to about 1.2 m.i.p. and saturates for
higher values of the injected charge. Figure 9(b)
is used hereafter to translate the ADC values into
charge in electrons. More details about the gain
calibration can be found in [27].

7. Results

7.1. Signal-over-noise ratio

Signal, noise and their ratio measured after diffe-
rent irradiation ﬂuences and bias voltages are sum-
marized in Table 1. The signal was deﬁned as the
average signal recorded by the hit pixel with tracks
perpendicular to the sensor plane, while noise was
the r.m.s of a Gaussian ﬁt applied to the signal
distribution recorded between spill gaps. The mea-
surements were performed with tracks perpendic-
ular to the sensor surface without magnetic ﬁeld.
As discussed above, the bias voltage must be in-
creased after irradiation in order to collect charge
from the full sensor thickness. The optimal bias
voltage at each ﬂuence was set to the minimum

cussed in Section 7.4.

×

The measured signal over noise ratio is high even
1014 neq/cm2,
after high ﬂuences. At a ﬂuence of 6
roughly corresponding to the ﬁrst four years of
LHC operation of the innermost layer, it exceeds 40
which corresponds to a charge of 15500 electrons,
roughly 65% of the value measured with the unirra-
diated sensor. By doubling the irradiation ﬂuence
the signal drops to 59% of the unirradiated sensor
signal when the bias voltage is increased to 600 V.
The noise becomes quite high and the signal over
noise ratio decreases to about 20. The high noise
is partly caused by the absence of leakage current
compensation in the readout chip. Nevertheless, as
we show in Section 7.3, it is still possible to op-
erate the sensor with a charge threshold of 2000

electrons maintaining the hit detection eﬃciency
above 97%.
The most irradiated sample is a factor of four above
speciﬁcations and almost in the range of irradia-
tion ﬂuences expected after LHC upgrade. The av-
erage signal is then about 6300 electrons. For ef-
ﬁcient particle detection the threshold has to be
set below 3000 electrons and the noise level kept
below 600 electrons. This might be possible with
a readout chip implementing a well–suited leakage
current compensation.

7.2. Position dependence of charge collection

The structured surface of the sensor can lead
to spatial variations in charge collection. We have
therefore investigated the charge collection with
tracks perpendicular to the sensor plane without
magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 10 shows the average collected charge as a
function of the hit position predicted by the beam
telescope for an unirradiated sensor operated at
150 V (Fig. 10(a) and (b)) and a sensor irradi-
1014 neq/cm2 and oper-
ated to a ﬂuence of 6
×
ated at 450 V (Fig. 10(c) and (d)). Shown are four
pixel cells with the metal line along the vertical
axis at the x = 125 µm position. The left column
(Fig. 10(a) and (c)) shows the charge collected in
the hit pixel while the right column (Fig. 10(b) and
(d)) shows the charge in a 3
3 cluster around the
hit pixel.

×

In the unirradiated sensor the charge is uni-
formly collected within the pixel implant with the
exception of the punch-through biasing structure
where the signal is reduced by up to 50%. The

latter is located too far from the pixel edge so that
the charge deposited in this position is not shared
with other pixels. The eﬀect of the punch-through
structure on the overall sensor performance is very
limited as it represents only 2–3% of the total
surface.

×

In the region between pixel implants the charge
3 cluster is not noticeably af-
summed over a 3
fected (see Fig. 10(b)). Charge sharing is restricted
to a region of about 10 µm around the pixel edge,
where the signal in the hit pixel decreases. It will
be enhanced by the external 4 T magnetic ﬁeld of
CMS and also for non perpendicular tracks.

After irradiation the charge collected in the hit
pixel decreases by about 30% due to trapping of
the charge carriers and the charge losses in the
punch-through structures become more promi-
nent. The sum of the charge collected in the hit
pixel and in the surrounding neighbours is shown
in Fig. 10(d). Charge sharing is uniform after ir-
radiation along all pixel borders except for the
region around the metal line. Similar eﬀects were
observed with other hybrid pixel detectors imple-
menting a biasing grid [29] and might be due to
the capacitive coupling of the metal line to the
underlying n-bulk after irradiation.

7.3. Hit detection eﬃciency

The sensor regions with reduced charge collec-
tion can be potential sources of detection ineﬃ-
ciency when a threshold is applied. The fraction
of undetected hits, or detector ineﬃciency, was
measured with tracks perpendicular to the sen-
sor plane. The hit was counted as detected if the

pixel determined by the beam telescope collected
charge above a threshold of 2000 electrons. This
value corresponds to the foreseen threshold in the
CMS experiment. Pixels cells with high noise or
with faulty bump-bond connections were excluded
from the analysis. Readout related ineﬃciencies
were also excluded. Figure 11 shows the hit de-
tection ineﬃciency as a function of irradiation ﬂu-
ence with and without magnetic ﬁeld. For each ﬂu-
ence the bias voltage was set to the values given
in Table 1. The particle detection ineﬃciency is
well below 1% for unirradiated sensors but it in-

×

creases with irradiation ﬂuence. The ineﬃciency
depends only weakly on the applied threshold. Af-
1014 neq/cm2 the ineﬃciency
ter a ﬂuence of 6
is still below 2% and acceptable for the operation
within CMS. For the sensors irradiated to ﬂuences
1014 neq/cm2 the undetected hits
lower than 2
are uniformly distributed within the pixel cell [30].
At higher irradiation ﬂuences the undetected hits
are located mostly in the punch-through structure
and along the metal line. This is due to the reduced
charge collection in these regions, as discussed in
Section 7.2.

Fig. 11. Hit detection ineﬃciency as function of irradiation
ﬂuence with (full dots) and without (empty dots) magnetic
ﬁeld. The pixel threshold is set to 2000 electrons.

By applying a 3 T magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the
horizontal axis of Fig. 10 charge carriers are de-
ﬂected from the electric ﬁeld lines and charge is
spread over a region of about 50-130 µm, depend-
ing on the amplitude of the Lorentz angle. The
charge deﬂection is parallel to the vertical axis of
Fig. 10. In this conﬁguration, the detection ineﬃ-
ciencies related to the metal line are unaﬀected by
the magnetic ﬁeld, while the ineﬃciencies due to
the punch-through structure are suppressed. Since
the overall detection ineﬃciency after irradiation
is dominated by the hits lost along the metal line
the values measured with and without magnetic
ﬁeld generally agree.

7.4. Charge collection across the sensor bulk

As discussed in the previous sections, charge col-
lection after heavy irradiation is aﬀected by trap-
ping of charge carriers. Electron and hole pairs
produced by traversing particles drift to the sen-
sor electrodes where the signal is induced. Particle
irradiation produces defects in the silicon lattice
which can trap these carriers and reduce the am-
plitude of the signal. Charges produced close to the
sensor backplane and drifting for a longer distance
are more likely to be trapped.

In pixel sensors, eﬀects due to irradiation can be
investigated with the so-called grazing angle tech-
nique [31]. As shown in Figure 12 the surface of

the sensor is oriented at a small angle α = 15◦
with respect to the hadron beam. The charge mea-
sured by each pixel along the x direction samples
a diﬀerent depth z in the sensor. The precise entry
point from the beam telescope is used to produce
ﬁnely binned charge collection proﬁles. The clus-
ter length determines the depth over which charge
is collected in the sensor.

×

The proﬁles measured with an unirradiated sen-
sor and with a sensor irradiated to a ﬂuence of
1014 neq/cm2 are shown in Fig. 13 as function
6
of the distance from the beam entry point. The
unirradiated sensor was operated at a bias voltage
of 150 V which is well above its depletion voltage
(approximately 70 V). The proﬁle of the collected
charge is uniform and has sharp edges, indicating
full depletion. The uniformity of the signal shows
that no charge is lost when crossing the whole
thickness of the sensor (a large x coordinate cor-
responds a large collection distance), as expected
for an unirradiated device. The irradiated sensor
was operated at bias voltages between 150 V and
600 V. It appears to be partly depleted at 150 V,
however, a second peak is observed at large x. By
increasing the bias voltage the amplitude of the
second peak increases and more charge is collected
from the sensor side close to the backplane, while
the increase at the n+ side is about 30%. At 600 V
charge collection is saturated but the proﬁle is not
as uniform as for the unirradiated case due to the
trapping of carriers produced far from the collect-
ing electrode.

The observed charge collection proﬁles do not
correspond to the classical picture of a partially de-
pleted sensor and even at low bias voltages charge is
collected from the whole sensor thickness. In [8–10]
it was demonstrated that the observed proﬁles can
be described by a two trap model producing a non-
constant space charge density across the bulk. This

leads to electric ﬁeld proﬁles with two maxima, one
at each sensor edge. In particular, the high electric
ﬁeld at the sensor backplane is necessary to explain
the tails at large x observed in the charge collec-
tion proﬁles shown in Fig. 13. The model is sup-
ported by measurements of the electric ﬁeld proﬁle
based on the ﬁeld dependence upon electron mo-
bility [32].

In the classical picture of a type inverted device
with constant space charge density across the bulk
the ratio is expected to grow as the square root
of the bias voltage. The charge collection proﬁles
were integrated along the x coordinate and the in-
tegral measured with the irradiated sensors was di-
vided by the value obtained with the unirradiated
sensor operated at 150 V. Figure 14 shows this ra-
tio as function of the square root of the bias volt-
age. The values are not corrected for possible gain
and thickness diﬀerences among the samples. The
charge ratio grows with increasing bias voltage and
then reaches a plateau. With increasing irradiation
the bias voltage at which the ratio saturates also
increases, showing that the detector has to be op-
erated at higher bias voltage to collect the same
deposited charge. The measured ratio grows faster
than the √V prediction as a consequence of the
doubly peaked electric ﬁeld proﬁle.

In the presence of magnetic ﬁeld the Lorentz
force acts on the charge carrier, that are deﬂected
from their drift along the electric ﬁeld lines. The
deﬂection angle (Lorentz angle ΘL) can be mea-
sured with the grazing angle technique [33]. The

and the charge carriers are deﬂected by the 3 T
magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the beam (see Fig. 15).
By measuring the angle β between the beam direc-
tion and the direction of the collected charge we
derive the Lorentz angle

The average cluster proﬁle is reconstructed using
the track entry point predicted by the beam tele-
scope. The cluster is sliced along the x axis and the
center of the each slice is measured along the y axis.
The angle β is obtained by ﬁtting the y position of
each slice as function of x with a straight line [15].
A measurement without magnetic ﬁeld is used to
correct for detector misalignment with respect to
the beam. Fig. 16 shows the Lorentz angle as func-
tion of bias voltage, extrapolated to 4 T magnetic
ﬁeld. The Lorentz angle decreases for increasing
values of the bias voltage due to the dependence
of the charge carrier mobility on the electric ﬁeld.

carrier mobility. In an unirradiated sensor the elec-
tric ﬁeld has a maximum at the backplane, where
the reverse bias is applied, and decreases linearly
with increasing depth. However, after irradiation,
the doubly peaked electric ﬁeld produces a Lorentz
angle distribution with minima at the sensor edges
and a maximum at medium depths. The Lorentz
angle as function of depth in the sensor bulk is
shown in Fig. 17 for irradiated and unirradiated
sensors, where a zero depth corresponds to the n+
side of the device. The Lorentz angle is obtained
from Eq. 5 and the measurement of the carrier mo-
bility as a function of depth [32].

A straight line ﬁt to the charge cloud implies a
constant Lorentz deﬂection throughout the whole
sensor thickness. A deeper analysis of our data
sample shows that this assumption is valid only for
unirradiated devices [32]. The Lorentz angle de-
pends on the charge carrier mobility, which is a
function of the electric ﬁeld across the sensor and
is given by

tan ΘL = rH Bxµ(E),

(5)

where rH is the Hall factor, Bx is the projection of
the magnetic ﬁeld along the x axis and µ(E) is the

The reconstruction of the primary interaction
and secondary vertices from heavy particle decays
requires a good spatial resolution. The resolution
of the pixel sensors is mainly determined by the
readout pitch and charge sharing between neigh-
bouring cells. Pixels have a weak capacitive cou-
pling and charge sharing is mainly due to diﬀu-
sion and drift of charge carriers under the com-
bined eﬀect of the magnetic and electric ﬁelds. Af-
ter irradiation, free carriers trapping produces an
inhomogeneous charge collection across the bulk
and charge sharing between neighbouring pixels
becomes strongly nonlinear on the impact position.
In addition, the beneﬁcial eﬀect of the Lorentz de-
ﬂection is reduced when a higher bias voltage is

applied to provide a suﬃcient drift ﬁeld. In what
follows we discuss measurements of the sensor spa-
tial resolution along the rφ direction, where the
charge drift is aﬀected by Lorentz deﬂection.

For the measurement of the spatial resolution
data were recorded with a 3 T magnetic ﬁeld now
perpendicular to the incoming beam. This corre-
sponds to tracks in the experiment with rapidity
η = 0. Events were ﬁrst selected with the proce-
dure described in Section 6.1. Pixels with charge
above 2000 electrons were selected and clusters
were formed by adjacent pixels above threshold.
Both side and corner adjacent pixels were included
in the cluster and a cluster threshold of 4500 elec-
tron was applied. When more than one cluster was
found the cluster with the highest charge was used
for the hit position measurement. To ensure that
the cluster was entirely contained in the pixel sen-
sor and well reconstructed, clusters adjacent to bad
pixels or to the sensor border were rejected. For
the irradiated detectors the background from noisy
pixels was reduced by searching for further clusters
in a ﬁducial region deﬁned by a 5
5 pixels win-
dow centered at the hit position predicted by the
beam telescope.

Figure 18 shows the deﬁnition of the track im-
pact angle β with respect to the sensor plane along
the y direction. The track is orthogonal to the sen-
sor plane (parallel to the x axis). The magnetic
ﬁeld in the z direction produces a Lorentz shift L =
D tan ΘL toward the left direction (see Fig.18),
thus, the total charge width is given by

W = D tan(β

The cluster is projected along the y direction by
summing the charge collected in the pixels with

17

the same y coordinate. For a cluster size of one the
position is given by the center of the hit pixel. For
larger clusters the hit position is determined by the
expression

y = yC +

(7)

where Qf irst (Qlast) is the charge collected in the
ﬁrst (last) pixel above threshold and yC is the geo-
metrical center of the cluster. The position reso-
lution is obtained by comparing the reconstructed
position with the prediction from the beam tele-
scope, as explained in Section 6.2. We deﬁne as
residual the diﬀerence between reconstructed and
predicted position. For single pixel clusters the dis-
tribution is binary, as shown in Fig. 19(a). The
residual distribution for clusters larger than one is
shown in Fig. 19(b). It is approximately Gaussian
with non-Gaussian tails which can be due to events
where secondary electrons (or δ-electrons) are pro-
duced in addition to the electron-hole pairs. Scat-
tered electrons can travel in the silicon lattice pro-
ducing larger clusters, for which the reconstructed
position is systematically displaced. Hereafter, the
spatial resolution is given by the r.m.s. of the resid-
ual distribution for events with cluster size equal
to one and by the σ of a Gaussian ﬁt for larger
clusters.

To further improve the spatial resolution for
events in which charge is shared among several
pixels the so-called η-correction is used [28]. As we
will show, the correction is particularly eﬀective
on irradiated devices, where the eﬀects of inho-
mogeneous charge collection are larger. Assuming
that the number of particles crossing the sensor is
uniformely distributed along y one expects that
the reconstructed position within a pixel is also
uniformely distributed. We deﬁne η as the non-
integer part of the position reconstructed from
Eq. 7. Figure 20(a) shows the η-distribution for
all events, where η = 0 corresponds to the center
of the pixel cell and η =
0.5 to its borders. The
measured distribution is almost ﬂat in the pixel
regions closer to the pixel borders and it shows
a dip at the center. The peak around zero is due
to clusters of unit size. The η-correction consists
in rescaling the reconstructed position in order

for single pixel clusters. In this case, the RMS of

larger size, the position of the maximum depends
on the bias voltage. A larger bias voltage produces
a smaller Lorentz angle, therefore the maximum is
shifted towards larger β. For higher or lower values
of β the residual width is smaller and the fraction
of hits with charge sharing increases.

The fraction of clusters of size one and two is
shown in Fig. 21(d-f) as function of impact angle.
For β = 90◦ the fraction of clusters with more

The main results presented in this paper can be

summarized as follows:
– A signal over noise ratio S/N

65 was achieved
≃
with unirradiated sensors. At the speciﬁed ﬂu-
1014 neq/cm2 the S/N ratio is 50.
ence Φ = 6
– For unirradiated sensors charge is uniformly col-
lected within the pixel implant with exception
of the punch-through structure where the col-

×

lected signal is 50% lower. However, the eﬀect of
the punch-through structure on the overall sen-
sor performance is very limited as it represents
only the 2-3% of the total surface. In the CMS
experiment the eﬀect will be further reduced by
charge deﬂection due to the magnetic ﬁeld.

– The hit detection ineﬃciency is

0.1% for unir-
radiated sensors and applying a threshold of
1014
2000 electrons. After a ﬂuence of Φ = 6
neq/cm2 the ineﬃciency is below 2% and is still
acceptable for the operation within CMS.

×

≃

– The ratio of the charge collected by irradiated
sensors divided by the charge collected by an
unirradiated sensor operated at 150 V was mea-
sured as function of the bias voltage using the
grazing angle technique. For a sensor irradiated
1014 neq/cm2 this ratio is larger than
at Φ = 6
60% for Vbias > 400 V.

×

– The Lorentz angle for an unirradiated sensor and
24◦ at 150 V and de-
a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld is

creases at higher bias voltages. After irradiation
we observe a Lorentz angle distribution across
the sensor thickness with minima at the sensor
edges and a maximum at medium depths which
is consistent with a doubly peaked electric ﬁeld.
– The position resolution for perpendicular tracks
and clusters of two pixels is σ
7 µm along the
coordinate with Lorentz shift. This precision can
be achieved also after irradiation by applying
the η-correction to reconstructed position. For
clusters of a single pixel the residual distribution

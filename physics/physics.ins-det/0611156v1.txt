We present preliminary results of measurements of the quenching factor for
Na recoils in NaI(Tl) at room temperature, made at a dedicated neutron facil-
ity at the University of Sheﬃeld. Measurements have been performed with a
2.45 MeV mono-energetic neutron generator in the energy range from 10 keV
to 100 keV nuclear recoil energy. A BC501A liquid scintillator detector was
used to tag neutrons. Cuts on pulse-shape discrimination from the BC501A
liquid scintillator detector and neutron time-of-ﬂight were performed on pulses
recorded by a digitizer with a 2 ns sampling time. Measured quenching factors
range from 19% to 26%, in agreement with other experiments. From pulse-
shape analysis, a mean time of pulses from electron and nuclear recoils are
compared down to 2 keV electron equivalent energy.

1. Introduction

Thallium activated Sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) crystals are a popular choice as
a target material for dark matter experiments. This is because of their rela-
tively high light yield and pulse shape diﬀerences between nuclear and elec-
tron recoils. Currently three experiments utilise these crystals: ANAIS [1];
DAMA/NaI [2]; and ELEGANT-V [3]. Although better discrimination can
be reached with other target media, NaI(Tl) crystal-based detectors re-
main one of the best at determining spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon limits.
For instance, for direct detection techniques, the NaIAD experiment [4]
still holds the best spin-dependent limit on WIMP-proton interactions [5].
Hence, NaI(Tl) remains an important detector material in non-baryonic
dark matter searches.

2. Measuring Scintillation Eﬃciencies

An important measurement to determine a scintillating target’s sensitivity
to dark matter particles is the ratio of light induced by a nuclear recoil
(produced by WIMP/neutron collisions with nuclei) to that by an electron
recoil of the same energy. This is known as the quenching factor.

Fig. 1. Schematic view of the detector arrangement used to measure the scintillation
eﬃciency of nuclear recoils in NaI(Tl).

The 2-inch diameter, encapsulated, NaI(Tl) crystal is placed in the path
of a 2.45 MeV mono-energetic deuterium-deuterium neutron beam as shown
in Figure 1. A 3-inch ETL 9265KB photomultiplier tube is optically coupled
to the crystal. Neutrons that interact with the target nuclei scatter oﬀ at
an angle that is dependent on the deposited neutron energy:

ER ≈

2mAEnmn
(mA + mn)2 · (1 − cos θ)

(1)

where ER is the recoil energy, mA is the mass of the target nucleus, En is
the energy of the neutron beam, θ is the scattering angle and mn is the
mass of the neutron.

A BC501A liquid scintillator detector is placed at various angles around
the target to detect scattered neutrons at nuclear recoil energies given by

Eq. (1). Pulses from the target and liquid scintillator that are coincident
within a 100 ns time window are sent to a 2-channel, 8-bit, Acqiris digitizer
with a 500 MHz sampling rate, and written to disk.

3. NaI(Tl) Response to Electron Recoils

It is known that the response of NaI(Tl) to gamma-rays is non-linear at low
energies [6,7]. The crystal is exposed to gamma-rays from a variety of low
energy sources, between 29 keV (129I Xe Kα X-rays) and 122 keV (57Co
γ-rays). A decrease in detector response is observed at the iodine K-shell
absorption edge at 33.2 keV, consistent with other studies [6,7]. Therefore,
determination of the energy scale must be performed in an energy region
where a linear response is observed. The crystal is calibrated with a 57Co
source, as shown in Figure 2(a). The iodine escape peak at 90 keV is also
seen. A light yield of 5.5 photoelectrons/keV is found.

4. Quenching Factor Measurements

The nuclear recoil energy spectrum measured at each scattering angle is
converted to an electron equivalent energy scale (keVee) and compared to
the expected nuclear recoil energy (keVnr) at that angle. The ratio between
the measured nuclear recoil energy, and that calculated from Eq. (1), is the
quenching factor.

In order to eliminate the background from gamma-ray interactions,
nuclear recoils are discerned by discrimination of pulse shapes from the

BC501A detector and time-of-ﬂight measurements.

Events that arise from gamma-ray interactions in the BC501A detector
have shorter decay times relative to those from neutron collisions. Adequate
discrimination between nuclear and electron recoils is achieved by integrat-
ing over the tail of the pulse. The ratio between this partial area and the
total pulse area is then plotted as a function of the total area. An example
is illustrated in ﬁgure 3(a).

Unlike gammas, neutrons that scatter oﬀ the target in this experiment
are non-relativistic. Therefore, after interacting with a sodium nucleus in
the crystal, a neutron takes approximately 40 ns to travel the 80 cm distance
to the BC501A detector. By taking the time diﬀerence between coincident
events in the target and BC501A detector, as shown in Figure 3(b), neutron
and gamma events are separated.

Better discrimination at energy scales relevant to dark matter searches
has been demonstrated in NaI(Tl) crystals using the mean time hti [6,8]
rather than the traditional double charge method [9]. The mean time is
deﬁned as: hti = Pi Aiti
Pi Ai , where Ai is the amplitude of the digitized pulse
at the time bin ti. After gamma events have been rejected by performing the
cuts outlined above, mean time distributions for each nuclear recoil energy
are investigated. An example is shown in Figure 3(c). This is compared with
the mean time of Compton recoils induced by a 22Na source in Figure 2(b).
In agreement with previous work [10], it is clear that this diﬀerence is less
prominent at energies less than 10 keVee, limiting the discrimination power
of NaI(Tl) detectors. This cut serves to reduce the background from noise
and gamma pulses, leading to a nuclear recoil peak as shown in Figure 3(d).

5. Results

The quenching factor varies between 19% to 26% in the range 10 keV to
100 keV nuclear recoil energy, which agrees with previous experimental
results [6,10–12], as shown in Figure 4. From Figure 3(d), a scintillation
eﬃciency of 25.2 ± 6.4% has been determined for 10 keVnr Na recoils.

Figure 4 shows that the quenching factor rises at low energies, agreeing

with the trend outlined by the theoretical upper limit [13].

6. Summary

Scintillation eﬃciency measurements have been performed for Na recoils in
a NaI(Tl) crystal. The results show an average value of 22.1% at energies
less than 50 keVnr, and are in agreement with other measurements. Future

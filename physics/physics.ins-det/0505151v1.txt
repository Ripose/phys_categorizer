Abstrat

A small liquid argon Time Pro jetion Chamber (LAr TPC) was operated for the

(cid:28)rst time in a magneti (cid:28)eld of 0.55 Tesla. The imaging properties of the detetor

were not a(cid:27)eted by the magneti (cid:28)eld. In a test run with osmi rays a sample

of through going and stopping muons was olleted. The hamber with the readout

eletronis and the experimental setup are desribed. A few seleted events were

reonstruted and analyzed and the results are presented.

The magneti bending of the harged partile traks allows the determination of

the eletri harge and the momentum, even for partiles not fully ontained in the

drift hamber. These features are e.g. required for future neutrino detetors at a

neutrino fatory.

Introdution

1.1 The liquid argon Time Projetion Chamber

The liquid argon time pro jetion hamber (LAr TPC) was proposed by C. Rub-

bia in 1977 [1℄. With an extensive R&D program, inluding the onstrution

of several prototypes of inreasing mass, the ICARUS ollaboration [2℄ has

demonstrated the feasibility of this novel tehnology for large mass detetors.

A 600 ton (T600) module onsisting of two idential 300 ton half-modules was

built and suessfully tested [3℄.

The LAr TPC is a 3-dimensional homogeneous traking devie with exellent,

high resolution imaging properties, and, at the same time it is a (cid:28)ne grain

alorimeter for fully ontained partiles due to the measurement of the energy

loss dE/dx along the harged partile traks. The detetor is ideally suited for

neutrino physis and a sensitive searh for nuleon deays [4℄. In ultra-pure

LAr (ontamination < 0.1 ppb O2 equivalent) the ionization harge of a trak

an be drifted undistorted over a distane of the order of meters in a uniform

eletri (cid:28)eld.

Figure 1 shows a shemati view of a TPC; it onsists of a athode, the sen-

sor planes and (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes (not shown in the (cid:28)gure) to produe a

homogeneous drift (cid:28)eld. The ionization eletrons drift along the eletri drift

(cid:28)eld to the sensor planes, where the harge is measured. In the LAr TPC de-

sribed here there are three sensor planes: the (cid:28)rst two planes are multi-wire

proportional hambers and the third plane is a printed iruit board (PCB)

with onduting strips. Preliminary results obtained with this hamber were

published in [5℄ and a detailed desription is given in [6℄. The sensor planes

are biased with potentials, suh, that the wire hambers are transparent to

the drifting eletrons, they only pik up an indued signal from the eletrons

passing through the plane (indution planes), the eletrons are then olleted

on the strips of the third plane (olletion plane). Eah plane provides a two-

dimensional pro jetion of a trak with the number of the hit wire (strip) and

the drift time as oordinates. The t0 for the drift time is given by trigger

ounters. The drift distane is alulated from the measured drift time and

the known drift veloity vd . Combining the wire hits of equal drift time from at

least two planes allows the three(cid:21)dimensional reonstrution of a trak [3,7℄.

As a onsequene of the short mean free path of the drifting eletrons in

LAr, they do not gain enough kineti energy between ollisions to ionize other

atoms, thus, there is no harge multipliation at the wires in LAr. However,

the high ionization density in the liquid allows a diret measurement of the

ionization harge with a very low noise ampli(cid:28)er; the expeted harge for a

2

minimum ionizing partile (mip) is of the order of 13 000 eletrons for 2 mm
trak length (at a drift (cid:28)eld of 0.5 kV/m). The ommerial VME(cid:21)like CAEN

1

modules

, designed and built for the ICARUS experiment (see hapter 3),

have been used as front end eletronis.

The low drift veloity (1.6 mm/µs at a drift (cid:28)eld of 0.5 kV/m) and the long

drift paths in detetors with big sensitive volumes (as e.g. in ICARUS) im-

plies that the eletrons spend a long time in liquid argon. This leads to the

requirement of an extremely low onentration of eletronegative impurities

(as e.g. oxygen) in LAr beause the drifting eletrons an be aptured by ele-

tronegative atoms or moleules, dereasing the harge arriving at the sensors.

If the impurity onentration is onstant over the whole volume, the harge

dereases exponentially with the drift time:

Q(t) = Q(t0) e− t

τ

where τ is the mean lifetime of the eletrons in argon. The lifetime is diretly
onneted to the O2 equivalent impurity onentration ρ by an inverse linear

The ommerial LAr 48 is spei(cid:28)ed to 1 ppm; this orresponds to a mean
lifetime of only 0.3 µs, absolutely insu(cid:30)ient for a TPC. A onsiderable amount

of R&D has been performed by the ICARUS ollaboration in order to master

the argon puri(cid:28)ation proess [3,9℄.

The drift veloity of the eletrons in liquid argon is small ompared to the

thermal veloity as a result of frequent ollisions of the eletrons with the

argon atoms; it an be approximated by [10℄

where τc is the mean time between ollisions. The drift veloity has been

measured at di(cid:27)erent temperatures as a funtion of the drift (cid:28)eld, and was

(cid:28)tted to an empirial formula [11℄. For later use (see hapter 1.2) we introdue

here the mobility of the eletrons, de(cid:28)ned as [10℄:

1.2 The LAr TPC in a magneti (cid:28)eld

The possibility to omplement the features of the LAr TPC with those pro-

vided by a magneti (cid:28)eld has been onsidered and would open new possi-

bilities [5,12,13,14℄: (a) harge disrimination, (b) momentum measurement

of partiles esaping the detetor (e.g. high energy muons), () very preise

kinematis, sine the measurement preision is limited by multiple sattering

(e.g. ∆p/p 4% for a trak length of L = 12 m and a (cid:28)eld of B = 1 Tesla). The

hallenging possibility to magnetize a very large, multi(cid:21)kton, volume of argon

has been addressed in [15℄.

The orientation of the magneti (cid:28)eld an be hosen suh, that the bending

diretion is in the diretion of the drift where the best spatial resolution is

ahieved. This is possible sine the Lorentz angle is small, as is shown below.

However, it is not mandatory and the B(cid:21)(cid:28)eld ould also be parallel to the

drift (cid:28)eld. In the following we onsider the ase where the magneti (cid:28)eld is

perpendiular to the eletri drift (cid:28)eld.

The required magneti (cid:28)eld for harge disrimination for a thikness x in LAr
(xp is the pro jeted thikness into the bending plane) is given by the bending
parameter b [13℄, as de(cid:28)ned in Figure 2:

Negleting the b2

term for α

1, b an be approximated by:

≪

The radius of urvature R of the harged trak due to the magneti (cid:28)eld is

given by:

R =

where B is the magneti (cid:28)eld strength, pt is the transverse momentum, i.e.
cosλ, and λ is the angle between the trak and its pro jetion on the
pt = p

bending plane (pith angle). Thus, the bending beomes:

0.3 B(T esla)(xp(m))2
2pt(GeV )

=

0.3 B(T esla)(x(m))2 cosλ
2p(GeV )

The multiple sattering ontribution to b an be obtained from [16, eq. 27.10℄.
Negleting the logarithmi orretion, inserting X0 = 14 m as radiation length
of liquid argon and using the pro jeted deviation MS = xθ0/√3 (see also

Figure 2), one obtains:

MS

≈

0.02 (x(m))3/2
p(GeV )

=

0.02 (xp(m))3/2
pt(GeV )√cosλ

The momentum resolution of a partile bending in a uniform magneti (cid:28)eld

an be found from equation 8. With the introdution of the urvature, de(cid:28)ned

as k

1/R, it beomes:

p ∆k cosλ

At low momenta, we an safely neglet the ontribution from the position

measurement error given the readout pith and drift time resolution and use

the [16, eq. 28.44℄ for the ∆k due to the multiple sattering. The momentum

resolution is then given by

∆p
p ≈

0.14

=

0.14
B(T esla)q(xp(m)) cosλ

and the statistial signi(cid:28)ane for harge separation an be written as (b±

(13)

For example, with a (cid:28)eld of 0.55 T, the harge of traks of 10 m length an be
separated at 2.6 σ with λ = 0. The requirement for a 3σ harge disrimination
an be written as b+

b− = 2b > 3 MS, whih implies a (cid:28)eld strength of

0.2 (T esla)

For long penetrating traks like muons, a (cid:28)eld of 0.1 T allows to disriminate
the harge for traks longer than 4 m, if perpendiular to the magneti (cid:28)eld.
This orresponds for example to a muon momentum threshold of 800 MeV/.

Unlike muons or hadrons, the early showering of eletrons makes their harge

identi(cid:28)ation di(cid:30)ult. The trak-length usable for harge disrimination is

limited to a few radiation lengths after whih the showers make the reogni-

tion of the parent eletron more di(cid:30)ult. In pratie, harge disrimination

B > 0.4 Tesla,
is possible for high (cid:28)elds x = 1X0
x = 3X0
B > 0.3 Tesla. From simulations, we found that the determination
of the harge of eletrons of energy in the range between 1 and 5 GeV is fea-
sible with good purity, provided the (cid:28)eld has a strength in the range of 1 T.

Preliminary estimates show that these eletrons exhibit an average urvature

su(cid:30)ient to have eletron harge disrimination with an e(cid:30)ieny of 20 % for
a ontamination with the wrong harge of less than 1 % [14℄.

In the presene of a magneti (cid:28)eld a Lorentz fore is ating on eah moving

harge, modifying the drift properties of the eletrons. As a onsequene, the

eletrons will not move along the eletri (cid:28)eld lines, but on a straight line at an

angle α to the E(cid:21)(cid:28)eld. In general, the drift veloity in a stati eletromagneti

(cid:28)eld is given by [16, eq. 24.7℄:

From Figure 3 it an be seen that for the ase of perpendiular E(cid:21) and B(cid:21)(cid:28)elds

the Lorentz angle α is given by:

From equation 5 we obtain for τc :

With the de(cid:28)nition of the mobility in equation 5 and using the empirial

expression for the drift veloity [11℄, we an alulate the Lorentz angle for a

given magneti (cid:28)eld (for perpendiular E(cid:21) and B(cid:21)(cid:28)elds):

The Lorentz angle is expeted to be very small in the liquid, e.g. 1.7◦
E = 500 V/m

and B = 0.5 T. Embedding the volume of argon into a

−1

at

magneti (cid:28)eld should therefore not alter the imaging properties of the detetor

and the measurement of the bending of harged hadrons or penetrating muons

would allow a preise determination of the momentum and a determination of

their harge.

2 TPC onstrution

2.1 Overview

The dimensions of the ryostat and the hamber were hosen to (cid:28)t into the

2

reyled SINDRUM I magnet

. The sensitive volume of the hamber has a

length (in the diretion of the solenoid axis) of 300 mm, a height of 150 mm
and a width orresponding to a maximal drift length of 150 mm.
The drift hamber (see Figure 4) onsists of a retangular athode, 27 (cid:28)eld

shaping eletrodes equally distributed over the whole drift path and three

detetor planes. The (cid:28)rst two detetor planes are wire hambers with the

to the vertial; the 127 stainless steel wires for eah
wires oriented at ±
plane have a diameter of 100 µm and a pith of 2 mm. The third plane is a
PCB with horizontal strips with a width of 1 mm and a pith of 2 mm on

60◦

whih the drift eletrons are olleted. The potentials of the three planes an

be varied from outside; the wires and the strips are oupled through a 470 MΩ
resistor to the bias high voltage and a 1.4 pF apaitor to 3 m long twisted

pair ables (see hapter 3), whih are onneted to the feedthroughs at the

warm part of the ryostat.

The athode and the (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes are designed to hold the high

voltage (up to a maximum of 22.5 kV was applied) and are thus arefully

insulated with PCBs and Maor— rods. Eight Maor rods with a diameter of

15 mm at the bottom and the top of the hamber were used to assemble the

athode, the (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes and the the sensor planes (see Figure 5),

giving enough mehanial stability to the hamber. With a resistor hain,

onneted to the athode HV at one end and to the wire hambers at the other

end, the (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes are onneted to the appropriate potential,

in order to obtain a homogeneous drift (cid:28)eld in the whole hamber volume.

Figure 5 shows the assembled hamber ready to slide into the ryostat.

The hamber is oriented in the LAr vessel suh, that the drift diretion is

horizontal; the

~E (cid:21)(cid:28)eld is perpendiular to the

~B(cid:21)(cid:28)eld, whih is also horizontal.

This orientation of the hamber has the advantage that the bending of the

harged partiles inident from the top is in the drift diretion, where the

spatial resolution is best.

The indution planes are omposed of a robust frame made of non-magneti

152 mm (outer di-
stainless steel (316L) with inner dimensions of 302 mm ×
194 mm). The frame thikness of the (cid:28)rst indution plane
mensions: 360 mm ×
is 10 mm and for for the seond indution plane it is 8 mm; it was alu-

lated to avoid a deformation of the frames under the fore of the wires. Eah

plane has 127 wires and eah wire has a tension (at room temperature) of
0.03) N; the distane between the two wire planes was set to 2.8 mm
(0.75

±

with a plasti spaer. The PCBs to solder the wires, the oupling apaitors

and the resistors were glued to the steel frame with Araldite—. The 100 µm

wires are made of the same material as the frames (steel 316L); they were

strung and soldered at PSI.

The oupling apaitors and resistors are mounted on the same PCB with the

The olletion plane is a PCB with a size of 300 mm ×
inside the frame of the seond indution plane. On the PCB there are 75 strips,
1 mm wide and with a pith of 2 mm. On the bak side of the PCB a 2 mm
thik steel plate is mounted at a distane of 5 mm from the PCB. The steel

plate and the PCB are glued to the Maor bars. The steel plate is onneted

to ground; it stabilizes mehanially the hamber and shields the olletion

plane. The PCB with the oupling resistors, apaitors and the signal onne-

tors is glued to the bottom side of the steel plate; the strips are onneted

with opper wires to the PCB. Figure 6 shows a zoomed view of the hamber

with the assembled sensing planes and the position of the oupling resistors

and apaitors.

Tests were made to prove that the glued PCBs do not detah from the frames

and the apaitors do not break due to the mehanial stress during the ool-

ing down: the hamber (without athode and (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes) was

ooled down as quikly as possible, but avoiding exessive thermal stress. For

a ooling down time of about 10 hours, the maximal temperature di(cid:27)erene
between the frame and the surrounding temperature was about 4 ◦

C. This

value for the maximal temperature di(cid:27)erene was kept as a limit during the

ooling down of the whole hamber in the ryostat.

2.3 The athode and the (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes

The athode is a 2 mm thik stainless steel plate onneted to the high volt-

age and to the resistor hain for the (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes. The plate is big

enough not to distort the (cid:28)eld in the drift volume near the athode; it is in-

sulated by a minimal distane of 20 mm to the LAr vessel, whih is grounded.

This distane is enough for liquid argon, whih has a breakdown (cid:28)eld strength

−

of about 1.1
1.4 MV/m, depending on the purity of the argon.
The (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes are made of 27 stainless steel (316L) frames,
0.8 mm thik, and surround the hamber volume. They are held at a distane
of 5 mm by slits in the Maor— rods. The (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes are onneted

to a resistor hain from the high voltage to the wire hambers. The resistors are

surfae mounted metal (cid:28)lm resistors with a nominal value (at room tempera-

ture) of 1 GΩ. Figure 7 (left) shows the eletri sheme of the resistor hain;
the resistane between two (cid:28)eld shaping eletrodes is alled 4R (R = 1 GΩ).

The distane between the (cid:28)rst indution plane and the losest (cid:28)eld shaping

eletrode is 16 mm. To avoid a distortion of the drift (cid:28)eld near the edge of

this (cid:28)rst wire plane, a PCB with strips (see Figure 6) was glued to the inner

sides of the 10 mm thik wire frame and the strips were also onneted to the

resistor hain; the resistane between the the (cid:28)rst (cid:28)eld shaping eletrode and

the (cid:28)rst strip is 3R, and between strips it is 2R. Figure 7 (right) shows how

the resistor hain is onneted through gold plated pins to the (cid:28)eld shaping

eletrodes. The total resistane of the resistor hain is more than 100 GΩ and

the urrent is negligible. The resistors used for the hain were tested to with-

stand shok ooling in LN2 , sine they were all onneted in series, hene, if

one would break, there would be no drift (cid:28)eld.

2.4 The high voltage system

The sensing planes are put at suh a potential that the wire hambers are

transparent for the drifting eletrons and then olleted on the olletion plane.

With a wire diameter of 100 µm and a pith of 2 mm, the (cid:28)elds before (E1 )
and after (E2 ) the plane have to ful(cid:28)ll the relation E2 > 1.37
E1 in order that
the wire plane is 100 % transparent [6℄.

·

During the test of the hamber di(cid:27)erent bias voltages were tested to inrease

200 V for the (cid:28)rst
the signal to noise ratio; the planes were (cid:28)nally put to −
indution, 0 V for the seond indution and +280 V for the olletion plane,
with a drift (cid:28)eld of 300 V/m. This on(cid:28)guration orresponds to a (cid:28)eld ratio
of 2.3 through the (cid:28)rst indution, and a ratio of 1.40 through the seond

indution plane.

The potentials are set externally by a VME HV power supply

with a delared

ripple of less than 2 mVpp. The potentials were fed into the ryostat through
2
20 kV SHV feedthroughs on a CF40 (cid:29)ange. The seond indution plane
has a 5 kV SHV onnetor and it is losed with a shortut onnetor to the
ground. The feedthroughs are onneted to the hamber by 3 m long oaxial

×

ables (type RG58).

3

4

The athode is supplied by a high voltage power supply

with a delared

ripple of less than 1

or 10 mVpp. Sine the argon gas has a low dieletri

10−5

·

strength, the onnetion of the HV feedthrough to the HV able inside the

argon ontainer has been poured with Araldite— . During the test with osmi

ray muons the voltage of the athode was (cid:28)rst set to 22.5 kV. After one week of

operation breakthroughs ourred. From that point on, the maximal voltage

held was only 4.7 kV, orresponding to a drift (cid:28)eld of 300 V/m.

3 The readout eletronis and the data aquisition system

3.1 The front(cid:21)end eletronis

The readout eletronis works as a multihannel wave form digitizer for the

329 hannels from the two indution planes and the olletion plane. The V791

modules [17℄ developed for the ICARUS experiment together with CAEN were

used as front(cid:21)end eletronis. Eah hannel is equipped with a low(cid:21)noise ur-

rent integrating preampli(cid:28)er [18℄ followed by a Flash ADC with 10 bit res-
olution. All hannels are sampled with a rate of 2.5 MHz, i.e., every 400 ns.

The digitized data are ontinuously stored in a irular bu(cid:27)er, whih is large

enough to ontain the data of all hannels for a time interval of about 1 ms; the
maximal drift time (tdmax ) ouring during this experiment was only about
150 µs. Figure 8 shows a shemati view of the data aquisition system. When
a trigger ours, the (cid:28)lling of the bu(cid:27)er ontinues for at least tdmax , in order to

have all the samples of the event stored in the bu(cid:27)er. Before the next trigger

is aepted, all the data in the bu(cid:27)er are transferred to a PCI omputer ard

in a PC; the PCI ard is read out with a LabView— program and the data

stored on the hard disk.

The signal with a harge orresponding to about 13 000 eletrons is deoupled
from the high voltage by a surfae mounted 470 MΩ resistor and a erami
apaitor of 1.2 nF (large ompared to the input wire plus able apaity of
about 130 pF). The hamber and the vauum feedthroughs are onneted by
5
3 m long twisted pair (cid:29)at ables. The twisted pair ables are Te(cid:29)on insulated

and are suited to use in vauum and in high purity liquid argon. The low a-

paity twisted pair able also suppresses possible mirophoni noise due to

vibrations in the magneti (cid:28)eld.

Outside the ryostat about 20 m of the same type of twisted pair ables on-

with the preampli(cid:28)ers and the ADCs. One module has 32 input hannels. Its

funtion is to amplify, shape and digitize the signals oming from the detetor

and transmit the digitized data via a fast serial link to the bu(cid:27)er module. Two

di(cid:27)erent versions of the V791 module are available, the Mod. V791C and the

Mod. V791Q, whih operate in "quasi urrent" and "quasi harge" mode, re-

spetively; the two versions di(cid:27)er in the feed bak and restore time onstants.

Figure 9 shows shematially the pulse shapes before the ampli(cid:28)er/shaper

stage for the three sensor planes; the urrent mode is used for the unipolar

signals from the (cid:28)rst indution and the olletion plane, and the harge mode

is used for the middle plane (seond indution plane). The measured signals

are indued by the moving harge of the drift eletrons and are proportional

to the drift veloity. Thus, stritly speaking the signal from the (cid:28)rst indution

plane is also bipolar: a small negative part from the slowly drifting eletrons

approahing the plane from the drift volume, and a muh larger positive part

indued when the eletrons have passed through the plane and drift away

muh faster in the larger drift (cid:28)eld between the two indution planes. The

bipolar signal of the middle plane is aused by the eletron loud, whih is

(cid:28)rst approahing and then moving away from the plane. The olletion plane,

of ourse, produes a true unipolar signal.

The digitized data are onverted

into three LDVS (Low Voltage Di(cid:27)erential

Signaling) data streams and ontinuously sent to a speially built interfae

with a irular bu(cid:27)er. At a lok frequeny of 40 MHz, the following 21 bits

of TTL data are transmitted with every lok yle:

• 10(cid:21)bit ADC data of the hannels k ;
• 10(cid:21)bit ADC data of the hannels k+16;
• 1 SYNC(cid:21)bit, set to 11 when the ADC data of hannels 15 (k = 15) and 31

are transmitted and 0 otherwise.

3.2 The bu(cid:27)er module

An interfae between the eleven V791 CAEN ards and the omputer has been

built, able to store the ontinuous (cid:29)ow of digital data in a irular bu(cid:27)er and to

send the data to the PCI ard in the omputer, one a trigger has ourred [6℄.

The interfae onsists of eleven bu(cid:27)er ards (one per V791 module) onneted

through a dediated bus to the main board.

Figure 10 shows of the blok diagram of the bu(cid:27)er ard. A single bu(cid:27)er ard

ontains a serial link reeiver iruit (DS90CR214 of National Semiondutor)

to onvert the LVDS data streams from a V791 module bak to 21 bits of

CMOS/TTL data. As long as no trigger is deteted, the data are stored into

the memory. The bu(cid:27)er on eah ard has a size of 32 k
24 bits. The two
10(cid:21)bit data samples plus the synhronization bit transmitted in a yle an
hene be stored in a single memory ell; there are 3 bits left to store additional

×

information, e.g. about the trigger. The size of the memory is large enough to

store 2048 samples of a single hannel. The address of the memory is generated

by the main board, using an inrement on every lok yle and is the same

for all the bu(cid:27)er ards. The address is oded with the Gray method [19℄ in

order to redue the signal interferene on the bus.

The main board onsists of a bus with slots for 19 bu(cid:27)er ards, two ALTERA

FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) hips and an independent stati

. One ALTERA hip (the EPM3128ATC100-5) is

programmed to drive all the bu(cid:27)er ards during the waiting for a trigger and

also handles the trigger [6℄. After a trigger is deteted, the EPM3128ATC100-

5 hip waits a ertain number of lok ounts, whih an be seleted by a 5

dip(cid:21)swith, and then stops the memory (cid:28)lling of all bu(cid:27)er ards in order to

read the whole memory and send it to the omputer. Choosing with the swith

an appropriate waiting time to stop the memory (cid:28)lling after a trigger allows

to set the length of the pre(cid:21)trigger data, whih are stored with an event. This

is important for the (cid:28)t of the base(cid:21)line of a hannel in the time before the

atual signal starts. In our experiment with osmi rays the swith was set

so that the trigger time orresponded to the memory address 1024, i.e. the

position and the drift time indiated.

When the memory of the bu(cid:27)er ard 0 is ompletely read, the memory of the

next bu(cid:27)er ard is read. The data are transmitted to the seond ALTERA

hip, the EPM3256ATC144-7, and then to the omputer via a PCI ard. The

seond ALTERA EPM3256ATC144-7 is onneted with a 16

with the osmi rays the ALTERA hip was only programmed to transmit the

data from the bu(cid:27)er ard to the PCI omputer ard.

A LabView— program running under Windows XP on a PC read the data

from the 12 MB/s PCI-7200— from ADLink
hard disk; 100 events were stored in a 137 MB (cid:28)le. The LabView program also

and stored them in a (cid:28)le on the

was normally deativated during the data taking with osmi rays, reduing

the dead time for the next trigger. The maximal trigger rate was in this ase

about 1/2 Hz, orresponding to a data (cid:29)ow of about 685 kB/s.

4 The experimental setup

The dimensions of the hamber and the LAr ryostat are suh, that they (cid:28)t

into the bore hole of the reyled SINDRUM I magnet from PSI. Figure 13

is a 3D CAD drawing showing a ut through the setup with the essential

omponents of the experiment.

The ryostat onsists of three ylindrial stainless steel vessels (see setion 4.1).

The LAr vessel is shown in red and ontains the hamber and the puri(cid:28)ed

liquid argon. The LAr is kept in a liquid nitrogen (LN2) bath to stabilize its

temperature and pressure. The nitrogen bath, shown in blue, ontains nitrogen

with an absolute pressure of about 2.7 bar in order not to freeze out the argon,

whih is at about 1 bar. The outer most ontainer for the vauum insulation

of the ryostat is shown in green in Figure 13.

The solenoid magnet an generate an axial magneti (cid:28)eld up to 0.55 T in the

region of the hamber (see setion 4.2). The magnet is ooled with a losed

water ooling system onneted to the main laboratory water ooling iruit.

Eleven plasti sintillator ounters are mounted on top, in the bore hole and

The temperature, the pressure and the level of both ryogeni liquids are

monitored by the slow ontrol sensors and the data are stored in a (cid:28)le (see

setion 4.4).

The ommerial grade liquid argon is (cid:28)lled into the LAr ontainer through a

puri(cid:28)ation artridge (see Figure 17) in order to reah a ontamination of the

LAr with eletro-negative impurities of about 2 ppb (O2 equivalent), whih is

neessary to obtain a lifetime of the drift eletrons of the order of the maximal

drift time, i.e., about 150 µs (see setion 4.5). The LAr ontainer is pumped

before it is (cid:28)lled with LAr.

The experiment is loated 11 m underground in a laboratory of the Institute

for Partile Physis, ETH Zurih. The resulting underground depth of the

hamber is 7.3 m water equivalent (730 g/m

2

).

4.1 The ryostat

The ryostat onsists of three onentri ylinders (see Figures 5 and 13); it is

onstruted out of non(cid:21)magneti stainless steel (316L) in order not to distort

the magneti (cid:28)eld. All the signal ables, the HV ables, slow ontrol ables

(and additional (cid:28)lling tubes) pass through vertial himneys (80 mm inner
diameter and about 500 mm long) welded on top of the LAr and LN2 vessels

at the end, whih is outside the magnet (see Figure 13). A burst disk, safety

valves and an eletro(cid:21)mehanial valve to regulate the nitrogen pressure were

mounted on top of the himneys.

The LAr vessel, ontaining the hamber, has an inner diameter of 250 mm
and a total length of 1371 mm yielding a volume of about 65 ℓ of argon. The

hamber is positioned in the ryostat suh, that it is in the enter of the

magnet. The vessel is sealed on both ends with CF250 (cid:29)anges. The liquid

argon is (cid:28)lled and emptied through a 16 mm tube at the bottom of the vessel

(see Figure 17).

The next onentri ylinder around the LAr vessel ontains the liquid nitrogen

0.1 bar in order to reah the
bath. The absolute pressure is regulated to 2.7
boiling temperature of about 87 K for argon at 1 bar, hene preventing the

±

freezing out of the LAr. Sine the LAr vessel is hermeti (the over-pressure

20

valve opens at about 1.6 bar, well above the operating pressure of about 1

bar), the pressure of the argon is regulated only by its temperature, i.e., the

temperature of the bath. The LN2 ylinder is 1434 mm long and has an inner
diameter of 350 mm with a volume of about 75 ℓ of LN2 . The tehnial grade
with a total apaity of 180 ℓ at a pressure of
LN2 is ontained in a dewar
4.5 bar in order to (cid:28)ll the bath at 2.7 bar with a su(cid:30)ient (cid:29)ux. During the
data taking the LN2 bath had to be re(cid:28)lled every 12 hours (see hapter 5).

9

The (cid:29)anges of the LAr and the LN2 vessels an be heated with two heating
with a power of 40 W per foil to speed up the warming proess in ase

10

foils

the ontainers have to be opened.

Both, the LN2 and the LAr vessel, have to be vauum insulated. The last

onentrial ylinder serves as insulation vauum hamber and has an outer

diameter of 549 mm and a length of 1917 mm with an evauated volume of
about 220 ℓ. Also the vertial himneys of the LN2 and the LAr vessel are

vauum insulated up to the top. These two tubes and the whole LN2 vessel
are wrapped with about 40 layers of super(cid:21)insulation foils to suppress the

irradiated energy from the vauum hamber (whih is at room temperature).

The insulation vauum was better than 10−6

mbar with the old ryostat.

4.2 The magnet

The solenoid magnet used in this experiment is the reyled SINDRUM I

magnet from PSI. The bore holes in the end aps of the yoke were widened in

order to have a 580 mm aperture to permit the insertion of the ryostat.

The magnet has a ylindrial shape with an outer diameter of the yoke of

1260 mm and a length of 1280 mm. The power supply delivers a maximal
DC urrent of of 850 A at a voltage of 260 V; the power onsumption of the
magnet is about 220 kW for the maximal urrent. Table 2 summarizes the

most important parameters of the magnet and its ooling system.

A (cid:28)eld map was measured inside the LAr vessel, in the region of the drift

hamber; it is shown in Figure 15. The urrent for these measurements was

800 A; the magneti (cid:28)eld reahes a maximum of 0.518 T in the enter of the
volume of the hamber and about 0.511 T at the side. Extrapolating linearly
with the urrent, this orresponds to a (cid:28)eld of 0.550 T in the enter with a
urrent of 850 A. The inhomogeneity of the (cid:28)eld inside the hamber is of the
order of 1.5 %.

4.3 The trigger system

There are a total of eleven trigger sintillators mounted as shown in Figure 13:

three sintillators are on the top of the magnet, two are in the bore hole on

top of the ryostat and six are at the bottom of the magnet. The plasti sin-

tillators measure 822 mm×

11

155 mm and are 5 mm thik; they are read out at

one end by a Philips photomultiplier

tube.

The angular distribution of osmi muons on the surfae of the earth is pro-

portional to cos2θZ (θZ is the zenith angle), hene, most partiles ome from

the zenith and the (cid:29)ux dereases with inreasing zenith angle; this is even

enhaned by the surrounding material of the detetor. With a sensitive area

2

and a solid angle aeptane around the zenith diretion of 0.28 sr,
of 0.045 m
the estimated muon rate is about 0.7 Hz [6℄; this value is onsistent with the
measured trigger rate of 0.55 Hz. For stopping muons, the estimated rate or-
responds to one event every 58 s, whih is also ompatible with the measured

value.

The data were taken with two di(cid:27)erent triggers. The (cid:28)rst one tiggers on

through(cid:21)going muons and requires a oinidene between the sintillators on

top, in the bore hole and at the bottom of the magnet.

The seond trigger was used to detet stopping muons. The V791 CAEN

ards desribed in hapter 3 have an output of the ampli(cid:28)ed analog sum of

all 32 hannels. One analog sum of the module proessing the signals from

the entral region of the olletion plane was used for this trigger. The two

sintillators in the magnet bore hole were used to open a gate; if a partile

passes through the hamber the analog sum would be over a given threshold.

The oinidene of the two signals generates a trigger at the end of the gate.

The t0 (passage of the partile through the hamber), used to determine the

drift time, orresponds to the leading edge of the gate. Figure 16 shows the

timing diagram for this trigger.

4.4 The slow ontrol system

The slow ontrol sensors are ruial to ontrol the experiment during the

ritial phases, like the pumping period, the ooling down with LN2 and (cid:28)lling

LAr, and during the warming up; it is also important to monitor permanently

the experiment during the data taking phase. The slow ontrol sensors measure

the temperature in many positions of the experiment, inside the liquid argon,

around the ryostat and also in the ooling system of the magnet. Pressure

gauges measure the argon and the nitrogen pressure and the apaitive level

meters measure the level of the LN2 and the LAr. All the data are read by
a dediated omputer in a yle of about 30 s and stored in a (cid:28)le (see [6℄ for

more details).

4.5 Puri(cid:28)ation of the LAr during the (cid:28)l ling

To reah an eletron live time in liquid argon of 150 µs (orresponding to

the maximal drift time in the hamber), the vessel and the hamber had to

24

be leaned and evauated to avoid eletronegative impurities on the surfaes.

10−4

The ommerial liquid argon 46

has a delared ontent of O2 < 5 ppm and
H2O < 10 ppm and there is no ommerially available argon with a purity

12

·

of the order of ppb. Thus, a (cid:28)lter for eletronegative ions has been plaed

between the dewar with the ommerial LAr and the vessel with the hamber

as shown in Figure 17.

The (cid:28)lter onsists of a ylinder with 63 mm internal diameter and 463 mm
5 µm) opper pow-
3 µm holes in

length made of stainless steel, (cid:28)lled with (cid:28)ne (grain size ≈
der. On both ends of the tube there are metal sieves with ≈

order to ontain the powder inside the artridge. The small amount of oxygen

ontent in the liquid argon will be bound hemially by the opper in the ar-

tridge via the 2Cu + O2

2CuO reation. At 87 K the water inside the LAr

→

is trapped on the surfae of the powder and is easily (cid:28)ltered.

The artridge is enlosed by an insulated ylinder of 200 mm inner diameter
and 898 mm length. Before (cid:28)lling with LAr, the artridge is ooled by insert-

ing LN2 into this ylinder.
13
The artridge was (cid:28)rst (cid:28)lled with opper oxide (CuO) purhased from Fluka
and then redued by (cid:29)owing a hydrogen/argon gas mixture at about 200 ◦

C

through the losed artridge; the hemial reation of the redution proess

is CuO + H2

Cu + H2O. The admixture of argon gas avoids an overheat-

→

argon perentage, it also helps the water vapor to be expelled.

5 Test run with osmi rays

In November 2004 the setup was ready for a (cid:28)rst test. Starting with the

vauum pumping of the liquid argon vessel, the slow ontrol program stored

all important information on the status of the setup in a ompletely automati

way.

5.1 Vauum in the ryostat

The liquid argon vessel with the hamber installed was pumped the (cid:28)rst time in

May 2004 to test the vauum tightness of the vessel and to let the ables (with
a total length of about 3 km) out-gas. In the next month the vessel was kept

th

period, two vauum gauges mounted on the LAr vessel were read: one near the

turbomoleular pump, the other one was mounted on the (cid:28)lling tube, at the

bottom of the vessel; the pressure near the drift hamber should be between the

two values. The four spikes seen in the (cid:28)gure orrespond to vauum breaks with

Ar gas in order to (cid:28)nish the mounting. The vauum breaks had no in(cid:29)uene on

the (cid:28)nal vauum, and after a few hours the equilibrium with the out-gassing

was reahed again. Around day 5 until day 11 the temperature of the vessel
was slightly inreased up to about 35 ◦

5.2 Cooling down and (cid:28)l ling with liquid argon

In November 2004 the liquid nitrogen vessel was ooled down slowly by (cid:28)lling

small amounts of liquid nitrogen distributed over a period of about two days;

the LAr vessel was still under vauum during this phase. The (cid:28)lling rate was

hosen in order to keep the temperature of the drift hamber as homogeneous

as possible. Figure 19 shows the temperature at three di(cid:27)erent loations: at the

bottom of the LAr ylinder (blue), on the drift hamber frame (red) and the

ambient temperature in the LAr vessel (blak); the latter two temperatures are

almost indistinguishable on Figure 19. The di(cid:27)erene between the temperature

of the drift hamber frame and the ambient temperature in the LAr vessel is

shown in Figure 20; the liquid nitrogen (cid:28)lling rate was hosen in order not to

exeed a maximal di(cid:27)erene of 4 ◦

C.

One the LN2 vessel was (cid:28)lled with liquid nitrogen, the pressure was regulated
(see hapter 4) to an absolute pressure of 2.7 bar (in order to reah the right
temperature for liquid argon with an absolute pressure of about 1 bar), and

the LAr ontainer was (cid:28)lled (∼

65 ℓ) in about 2 hours.

5.3 Measurements with the LAr TPC

On November 23

2004 the setup was ready for a (cid:28)rst test. Starting the

rd

tests without magneti (cid:28)eld and triggering with the sintillator ounters, lean

osmi ray traks were immediately observed at a drift (cid:28)eld of 500 V/m.
With every run 100 trigger events were stored. At the beginning there was a

ommissioning period without magneti (cid:28)eld, when some through(cid:21)going muon

events were taken with inreasing drift (cid:28)eld. The maximum (cid:28)eld applied was

1.5 kV/m, i.e., 22.5 kV at the athode. After a week of operation, breakdowns

ourred in the high voltage system. After this time the high voltage was

limited to 4.7 kV, orresponding to a drift (cid:28)eld of 0.3 kV/m.

The level of the liquid nitrogen was monitored to avoid a drop to a too low

level, whih would ause an inrease of the temperature in the liquid argon

vessel. A re-(cid:28)lling every 12 hours was neessary to replae the evaporated
nitrogen, orresponding to a global onsumption of about 1.4 ℓ/h, equivalent
to 62 W of thermal losses. Figure 21 shows the LN2 level and the temperature

and pressure of the liquid argon during two days of data taking with the visible

liquid nitrogen (cid:28)llings twie a day.

In the beginning of the test run a oinidene of the sintillators was required

for a trigger to detet through(cid:21)going muons. In this ase only about 20 (cid:21) 30 %

of the triggered events had a trak in the drift hamber. This e(cid:30)ieny is

given by the position of the sintillators, whih give a trigger signal also for

muons passing lose to the hamber, but not traversing the sensitive volume.

To trigger on stopping muons, a oinidene between the sintillators on top

two days of data taking. Visible are the liquid nitrogen (cid:28)llings twie a day.

29

of the ryostat in the magnet bore hole and the analog sum output of the 32

hannels from a CAEN V791 board was required. The sintillators give in this

ase only the t0 time of the event, needed to determine the drift time.

Figures 22 shows some examples of visually seleted events from the total

30 400 olleted events. The raw data from the olletion plane are

sample of ∼

displayed as two-dimensional pro jetion of traks in the plane perpendiular to

the magneti (cid:28)eld: the horizontal axes orrespond to the drift time (onverted

to a drift distane with the drift veloity) with a full sale of about 150 mm,

and the vertial axes are the strip number oordinates, also with a full sale

of 150 mm. The magneti (cid:28)eld is pointing into the plane of the (cid:28)gure and had
a value of 0.55 T. The events are interpreted as a) a reation with an argon

nuleus, b) a stopping positive muon with the deay positron, ) a muon trak

with an eletron(cid:21)positron pair, d) a muon with a δ(cid:21)eletron, e) a stopping

negative muon and f ) an eletro-magneti shower.

6 Event seletion and results

For a (cid:28)rst analysis events with a simple topology, namely positrons emitted

by stopped muons and δ -eletrons from passing(cid:21)through muons were hosen

[20℄. The olleted events were sanned by eye with the Qsan program. This

program displays a two dimensional gray sale representation of the output

signal in the wire/drift time oordinate plane and provides the possibility to

all a hit (cid:28)nding and (cid:28)tting algorithm, whih gives the needed information

for the event reonstrution. Events were seleted if the trak length of the

eletron/positron (in the plane perpendiular to the magneti (cid:28)eld) is at least

2 m and if the urvature of the trak is well visible, i.e. the transverse pro-

jeted trak should be reognizable as a setion of a irle, whih biases the

event seletion.

A 3D reonstrution of the eletron/positron traks is neessary for a full

alorimetri reonstrution and a determination of the total momentum. A

detailed desription of the spatial reonstrution proedure is given in [3,7℄.

A small sample of 15 δ -eletrons and 9 deay positrons, fully ontained in the

hamber, were seleted from 30'400 reorded and sanned events. These events

were reonstruted and their momentum and kineti energy was determined

from the magneti bending and the summed up energy loss, respetively [20℄.

In Figures 23 and 24 the transverse momentum obtained from the energy

(harge) measurement is plotted against the momentum from the magneti

bending for δ -eletrons and deay positrons together (irles: δ -eletrons, tri-
x) through
angles: deay-positrons). The straight line (cid:28)t ((cid:28)t funtion: y = p1

individual data points and Figure 24 inludes the errors of the transverse mo-

errors are obviously muh larger than the sattering of the data points around

the (cid:28)tted straight line; the χ2/ndf is equal 0.05, indiating that the error is

over estimated. This disrepany an be attributed to the event seletion, in-

troduing a bias towards traks with little multiple sattering showing niely

bent traks. For the error of the transverse momentum evaluated from the

energy see [20℄.

The slopes of the two plots are p1=0.9480± 0.0431 for Figure 23, and p1=0.9122
± 0.1814 for Figure 24; thus, the slopes are ompatible with 1.

6.1 Energy loss and the eletron lifetime in LAr

Figure 25 shows the measured kineti energy plotted versus the path length.

The slope of a linear (cid:28)t gives an estimate for the (average) spei(cid:28) energy loss

dE/dx, sine the energy loss is assumed to be onstant (exept for the last

2 mm of a trak [20℄). The slope in Figure 25 orresponds to an average energy

loss of 1.642 (± 0.069) MeV/m. The theoretially expeted value is about 1.9 -

2.2 MeV/m for eletrons (positrons) in the range between 1 MeV and 20 MeV.

Thus, the measured and the expeted values di(cid:27)er by about 20%. However, the

energy loss dE/dx from the measured harge depends on the assumed lifetime

τ of the drift eletrons; a (cid:28)rst estimate of 150 µs was used for the lifetime

to alulate the kineti energy. Varying the eletron lifetime and realulating

expeted theoretial value yields an eletron lifetime in the range of 60 µs -
80µs.

7 Conlusions

In an e(cid:27)ort to further develop the LAr TPC tehnology, a small test TPC was

built and operated for the (cid:28)rst time in a magneti (cid:28)eld (0.55 T), whih was

perpendiular to the eletri drift (cid:28)eld. The quality of osmi ray traks is not

signi(cid:28)antly dereased with the magneti (cid:28)eld turned on.

Combining the exellent imaging and alorimetri properties of a LAr TPC

with a magneti (cid:28)eld opens new experimental possibilities. The magneti

bending of harged partiles allows the momentum determination also for

partiles leaving the sensitive volume and the determination of the sign of the

eletri harge. The latter feature is a must in future neutrino experiments

searhing for CP(cid:21)violating e(cid:27)ets in the lepton setor.

A speial interfae between the ICARUS front-end eletronis (V791 CAEN

boards) and the omputer was developed and built for the data aquisition

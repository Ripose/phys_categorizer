We present a simple and low-cost implementation of a fast electronic coincidence detector based
on PECL logic with a TTL-compatible interface. The detector has negligible dead time and the
coincidence window is adjustable with a minimum width of 1 ns. Coincidence measurements of
two independent sources of Bose-Einstein distributed photocounts are presented using diﬀerent
coincidence window widths.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Detecting coincidence of two events is crucial in many
areas of science, such as quantum optics [1, 2, 3], bio-
physics [4], and nuclear physics [5, 6]. Most commer-
cially available electronic coincidence detectors are based
on time-to-amplitude converters [7] and even though they
have good time resolution (∼10 ps), they are generally ex-
pensive and have relatively long dead times (1 µs). Other
types of commercial coincidence detectors [8], which use
AND gates, have ∼5–10 ns coincidence windows and they
can still be expensive. However, many applications re-
quire much narrower window to improve the signal-to-
noise ratio or to match the temporal width of the trigger-
ing event. For example, typical Si single-photon counters
for visible/near-infrared light have output pulses with
rise times that are less than 0.5 ns, which set the lower
limit of the coincidence window. Moreover, in our area of
interest, quantum optical information technology, multi-
ple coincidence measurements are often needed so that
cost and operational complexity are important consider-
ations.

In addition to time-to-amplitude conversion, there are
alternative methods to high-speed coincidence detection.
Measurements using an ultrafast digital oscilloscope on
two or more channels with deep storage memory allow a
long time history to be recorded, whose length depends
on the depth of the storage memory. This is particularly
useful for system testing and debugging purposes. How-
ever, a digital storage scope is not suitable for eﬃcient
and nearly real-time measurements because of the need
for extensive postdetection data processing. Personal
computer-based picosecond time-resolved multichannel
coincidence detection relies on measuring the time diﬀer-
ence between two events and very high time resolution
of a few picoseconds can be achieved, and is often used
in pump-probe ﬂuorescence lifetime spectroscopy. The
multichannel capability and ps time resolution requires
expensive hardware and the method is ill suited for a sim-
ple coincidence detection of two events within a ﬁxed time
window. In this work we present a simple and low-cost
circuit-board implementation of two-event coincidence
detection with a variable coincidence time window as

short as 1 ns and a small propagation delay of ∼5 ns. The
coincidence detector is based on positive emitter-coupled

used in a non-triggered continuous-wave (cw) mode or in
a triggered conﬁguration with sub-ns gating [3] that can
further improve the signal to noise ratio.
In addition,
the circuitry has essentially no dead time and hence it
can be used at rates up to hundreds of MHz. The cost
beneﬁt is signiﬁcant: our coincidence detector costs less
than $100 USD.

II. CIRCUIT IMPLEMENTATION

The easiest way to detect a coincidence of two events
is to apply an AND-logic operation to the pulses from
the two event detectors, but, in general, the output pulse
widths of the detectors are much longer than the desired
coincidence window of a few ns. For example, in our
photon counting work [2], the output pulse width from
a commercial Si single-photon counting module (SPCM)
[9] is ∼30 ns. Yet, in order to suppress accidental coinci-
dences it is desirable to detect the coincidence of the two
photons within ∼1 ns, limited by the ∼350-ps jitter of the
SPCM output pulse. Therefore, each pulse width should
be reduced to ∼1 ns before the AND operation is applied
and the AND gate should also be fast enough to detect
the sub-ns pulse overlap. Unfortunately TTL compo-
nents, which are commonly used in electronic equipment
including our SPCMs, are not fast enough to handle ns
signals. Our solution to this problem is to use PECL for
the core of the coincidence detection system and to em-
ploy TTL–PECL translators for interface compatibility.
The maximum rise or fall time for PECL is ∼400 ps and
hence PECL is suﬃciently fast for use with the Si SPCM.
The translation from TTL to PECL does not cause a loss
of timing information, but adds a common propagation
delay of a maximum of 600 ps to both channels. The
translation from PECL to TTL has a propagation delay
of 1.5–5 ns and a rise time of 0.3–1.6 ns, but these do not
aﬀect the performance because this on/oﬀ output is fed
to a counter.

Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the full circuit. For
each of the two input channels, a TTL signal derived
from an event detector such as a SPCM is translated

to PECL level (Fairchild 100ELT22MX) at the TTL-to-
PECL (TP) block. The resultant PECL pulse, which
is as long as the input TTL pulse (we shall use the Si
SPCM ∼30-ns output as the example throughout this
work), is shortened by the pulse reshaper (PR), and the
two narrowed pulses from the two channels go through
the PECL AND gate (On Semiconductor MC10E404) for
coincidence detection. Finally this PECL output is trans-
lated back to TTL level (ON Semiconductor MC10H350)
at the PECL-to-TTL (PT) block.

A disadvantage of using PECL logic to achieve low
noise and high speed core logic operation is that its sig-
nal routing is more complicated than other logic fam-
ilies. Diﬀerential interconnection between components
and several termination resistors at the output of each
component are required. The circuit board for PECL
components requires at least three layers to provide a
noise-free +5 V plane and a ground plane for the TTL
components. In our implementation, we used a four-layer
standard FR-4 laminate printed circuit board (PCB).
The line widths on the PCB were 0.25 mm (characteris-
tic impedance ∼65 Ω), except for the paths connecting to
the BNC connectors where 0.5 mm line widths were used
to provide 50 Ω impedance matching. These impedances
were calculated based on the 0.3-mm gap between the
ground layer and the top layer and a dielectric constant
of 4.6 for the substrate.

To reshape the long input pulse into a short one, we
used a NOT gate, an AND gate and a variable delay line
as shown in the schematic of Fig. 2. The delay line was
simply a short RG-58 coaxial cable whose length could
be changed to determine the reshaped pulse duration (5
ps/mm). The details of the pulse reshaper circuit are
shown in Fig. 3. The dashed box is a PECL fanout buﬀer
(Fairchild 100EL11M) that converts the diﬀerential input
into two diﬀerential outputs. The buﬀer FA was con-
nected to the diﬀerential input A of the AND gate with
62-Ω (R6) series terminations to match the characteristic
impedance of the line on the PCB [10].

The non-inverting terminal of the fanout buﬀer FB was
connected to the inverting terminal of the input B of the
AND gate to implement the NOT gate. This NOT path
includes the coaxial cable (CC in Fig. 3) to generate the
time delay. Unlike the rest of the circuit with short dis-

tances, this long delay line required a diﬀerent method
for impedence matching, and we chose the Thevenin-
equivalent parallel termination scheme [11] with a single-
ended interconnection. We did not use a diﬀerential in-
terconnection to avoid the use of two length-matched
coaxial cables for the inverting and non-inverting paths.
The non-inverting terminal of the AND gate input B is
biased at a reference voltage of 3.66 V, which is the mid-
point between PECL logic 1 and 0, and the voltage dif-
ference between this reference and the signal transmitted
by the coaxial cable serves as the diﬀerential input of the
AND gate.

the AND gate of the pulse reshaper, corresponding to
the schematic sketches of Fig. 2(b). Curve (A) of Fig. 4
shows an image of the input pulse to the reshaper with
a pulse duration of 33 ns, while curve (B) reproduces
its inverted image with a delay of ∼1 ns for the 20-cm-
long coaxial delay line. Curve (C) shows the shortened
pulse of the pulse reshaper output with a duration of the
desired width of ∼1 ns.

III. TIMING CALIBRATION

We calibrated the timing characteristics of the coinci-
dence detector by using two identical pulses with a vari-
able time delay as inputs. The two input pulses were
derived from the output pulse of a Si SPCM by split-
ting it into two signal pulses. The variable time delay
between −2000 ps and +2000 ps was obtained by us-
ing cables of diﬀerent lengths in steps of less than 1 cm
(50 ps). We measured the ratio of coincidences to singles
with an 80-MHz electronic counter (National Instruments
6602). This counter, however, cannot detect pulses less
than ∼3.5 ns in width. Since the AND gate output pulse
width is determined by the delay lines, a timing overhead
must be added. The amount of timing overhead was de-
termined experimentally by using diﬀerent lengths of de-
lay lines and measuring the eﬀective coincidence window
as described above.
In our circuitry, we increased the
delay lines to 50 cm of coaxial cables (instead of 20 cm)
to achieve a coincidence window of ∼1 ns. It should be
clear that for diﬀerent counters, the cable lengths must be
adjusted and the coincidence windows recalibrated. We
note that care was taken to reduce signal distortion be-
tween the coincidence detector and the electronic counter
by using twisted-pair connection (AWG 22 hook-up wire,
∼1 turns/cm) with series termination of 56 Ω.

Fig. 5 shows the timing results for the cases of 50 cm,
60 cm, and 70 cm delay lines, by plotting the coincidence
probability as a function of the relative delay between the
two input pulses. We note that the width of the transi-
tional region (deﬁned as the region with 10→90% proba-
bility) is ∼100 ps on each side for all three lengths of the
delay lines. We believe that the width of the transitional
region is due to the jitter of the triggering threshold of
the counter. To conﬁrm this, pulses from a digital de-
lay/pulse generator (Stanford Research Systems DG535,

3

5-ps delay resolution) were counted as the pulse width
was varied about the minimum width of ∼3.5 ns required
by the counter, and we obtained the same 100-ps tran-
sitional regions. The eﬀective coincidence window size,
deﬁned by the full width at half maxium (FWHM) in
Fig. 5, is 1.2, 2.2, and 3.26 ns for the 50-cm, 60-cm, and
70-cm delay lines, respectively.

IV. COINCIDENCE COUNTING
PERFORMANCE

We evaluated the performance of the coincidence de-
tector in a quantum optics experimental setup that we
modiﬁed to measure the accidental coincidences from two
independent Bose-Einstein distributed thermal sources of
photons and compared the results with theoretical expec-
tations. Two Si SPCMs were used as independent detec-
tors of thermal photons from room light that leaked into
the single-photon counters. The detected photocount
statistics follow the Bose-Einstein distribution for a ther-
mal ﬁeld with average singles count rates of N1 and N2 at
the two SPCMs, respectively. For a coincidence window
τ of a few ns, we set the singles detection probabilities to
be low such that N1τ, N2τ << 1, in which case the co-
incidence probability per window is simply given by the
product of the singles probabilities, N1N2τ 2. This yields
a coincidence rate of N1N2τ . In the measurements, we
counted both the coincidence and singles rates for dif-
ferent N1 and N2 and the results are shown in Fig. 6.
The horizontal axis is the product of the singles rates,
N1N2, and the plotted coincidence rates show a straight
line dependence for each coincidence window size with a
slope that is given by τ . From the slopes we obtain τ
of 1.13±0.04 ns, 2.21±0.03 ns, and 3.23±0.12 ns for the
50-cm, 60-cm, and 70-cm delay lines, respectively. The

linear dependence of the coincidence counts on N1N2 is
in good agreement with theoretical expectations, and the
measured τ values agree well with the electronic timing
measurements in Fig. 5.

V. DISCUSSION

4

We have implemented a simple design of a fast elec-
tronic coincidence detector based on inexpensive PECL
components. The coincidence window size can be eas-
ily adjusted by a change of the two coaxial cable delay
lines and can be as short as ∼1 ns. The detector has
a low propagation delay of ∼5 ns which allows this cir-
cuit to be used as a trigger for a more complex coinci-
dence measurement system. Also, the simplicity and low
cost of the demonstrated coincidence detection scheme
can be easily extended to multiple coincidence detection.
Adding timing overhead did not aﬀect the performance
of the coincidence detection. To characterize the coinci-
dence detector independently of the triggering properties
of the electronic counter, one can add a monostable mul-
tivibrator at the output of the AND gate, which can be
easily implemented using a ﬂip-ﬂop, a counter, and an
oscillator [12].

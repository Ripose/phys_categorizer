Abstract

The optical properties of LXe in the vacuum ultra violet (VUV), determining the perfor-
mance of a scintillation calorimeter, are discussed in detail. The available data, measured in
a wider spectral region from visible to UV light, and in a large range of Xe densities, from gas
to liquid, are examined. It is shown that this information can be used for deriving the LXe
optical properties in the VUV. A comparison is made with the few direct measurements in
LXe for VUV light resulting from the LXe excitation by ionizing particles. A useful relation
is obtained which connects the Rayleigh scattering length to the refractive index in LXe.

Introduction

An 800-liter LXe (liquid xenon) scintillation γ-detector is being developed for the MEG experiment,
which will search for the µ+ → e+γ decay at the Paul Scherrer Institute [1].

The MEG calorimeter is designed to achieve superior performances such as ∆Eγ = 4% for the
γ energy, a position resolution ∆xγ ≈ 5 mm, and ∆teγ = 150 ps for timing, where ∆ stands for the
FWHM resolution. The LXe calorimeter is only based on scintillation light without any attempt to
measure ionization. The ﬁnal detector will have an active volume of 800-liter LXe and 800 PMTs.
Since no such large size LXe detector was ever produced, smaller prototypes were made to gain a
know-how in LXe calorimetry. The ﬁrst prototype had an active volume of 2.34 liter LXe and 32
PMTs [2]. A second prototype has an active volume of 68.6 LXe and it is an important milestone
in view of the ﬁnal detector, since it allows to gain a practical knowledge of the behaviour of such
a device. Above all, the puriﬁcation of LXe and the long-term stability are essential for ensuring
a high light yield and a high performance of the detector.

The optical properties of Xenon in the VUV, where it emits when excited by ionizing radiation,
determine the performances of the calorimeter. These properties are not very well known for LXe.

Measurements are diﬃcult and experimental results are often not fully compatible. As it will be
discussed in detail in the next sections, extensive measurements are available for gaseous Xe at
various pressures, many in the visible region and some in the UV. The present note critically exam-
ines the experimental data. It discusses the limits in thermodynamical variables like temperature,
pressure, density, etc. within which Xe can be described by a simple approximation of a more
general expression valid for generic ﬂuids. It discusses how and up to which point measurements,
diﬀerent from the ones in the VUV for LXe, can be used to gain insight on optical properties of
interest for scintillation calorimetry.

2 Properties of LXe of interest for a scintillation calorimeter

We list in Table 1 and Table 2 quantities relative to Xenon which are of interest for its use in an
experiment. Reference is made to the sources of this information.

LXe has interesting properties as a scintillating detector medium. It has high density and high
atomic number, it competes with inorganic crystals like NaI in the number of photons emitted per
MeV, it has a fast response, it allows pulse shape analysis and particle identiﬁcation. The light

where hν is the ultraviolet photon. A remarkable feature of these processes is the close similarity
between the emission of gaseous and condensed pure noble gases. Such a behaviour is basically due
to the fact that in both cases the last relaxation step before the radiative decay is the formation
of an “excimer-like” state. This peculiarity is a strong hint at expecting that noble liquids are
transparent to their scintillation light, since the emitted VUV photons have an energy which is
appreciably lower than the minimum one for Xe atom excitation. Liquid rare gas scintillation
detectors were the subject of recent reviews [10]. The main properties of LXe we listed in Table 1
are the ones we are presently using in the Monte Carlo simulation of the MEG experiment.

Although an appreciable number of projects is based on the future use of large volume LXe
detectors, only a few, rather small size, LXe detectors were really used in experiments [15]. The
actual behaviour of a large size LXe calorimeter, namely: the quality of its energy measurements
and the determination of the event position and timing, directly depend on the transmission of the
emitted photons through the detector medium. One can introduce the quantities λatt, λabs, λdif ,
where λatt enters the expression for the light attenuation in LXe, I(x) = I0e−x/λatt and the three
characteristic lengths are related by:

(1)

(2)

(3)

λabs

λdif

.

λabs corresponds to a real absorption of photons, which are then lost for good. λdif is related
to photon elastic scattering and it can be assumed to coincide with λR, the Rayleigh scattering
length. Also relevant is the knowledge of the index of refraction n in the region of Xe VUV light
emission. The experimental knowledge of the quantities λatt, λabs, λdif and n for pure LXe is not
satisfactory. Measurements in the VUV are diﬃcult and can be inﬂuenced by spurious systematic
eﬀects, as discussed for instance in [10]. λabs has not been determined yet. A signiﬁcant lower
limit was recently established by us [1]. Several measurements of λdif and n are available, but
they diﬀer by amounts often larger than the stated errors. It should be noted that in the separate

3

determination of λabs and λdif , the linear dimension of the LXe cells must be at least comparable
with the value for the λ-parameters, if one aims at obtaining reliable measurements.

A possible explanation of some of the discrepancies among the available experimental data may
be connected with the degree of purity of the LXe. Small amounts of VUV absorbing substances
like H2O or O2, at the level of a few parts per million, can dramatically change LXe optical
parameters. No safe determination of optical parameters can leave aside monitoring the level and
the stability of the Xe purity.

While experimental measurements of the λ’s and n in LXe are scanty and suﬀer from problems,
better information is available for gaseous Xe at various pressures both for visible and VUV light
[16, 17, 18, 19].

One can then examine if optical properties for LXe can be derived from this information and if
the extrapolated values can be trusted. The passage from a dilute gas to gas under high pressure
or to the liquid phase implies a large variation in density. When this occurs non-linear eﬀects come
normally into play due to interatomic interactions.

3 Theoretical models for the optical properties of non-polar

rare gases

The link between the microscopic and the macroscopic ﬂuid properties is provided, in our case, by
the so called Clausius-Mossotti relation [20, 21]. The Clausius-Mossotti (as a function of dielectric
constant ǫ) and the Lorentz-Lorenz equation (as a function of the refractive index n) 1

FLL ≡

n2(ω) − 1
n2(ω) + 2

=

ǫ(ω) − 1
ǫ(ω) + 2

=

NAα(ω)ρ
M

= A(ω)ρm,

where NA is the Avogadro’s number and M is the molecular weight, provide a general relation,
valid for dilute non-polar gases, among the gas index of refraction n(ω), the molecular polarizability
α(ω) and the density ρ (units: g cm−3) or the molar density ρm = ρ/M (units: mol cm−3). As
we shall later see, A(ω) represents “the ﬁrst virial coeﬃcient”. At higher gas densities and for
the liquid and solid states, the simple equations (4) are in general no longer valid and non-linear
eﬀects come into play due to interatomic interactions.
In this case the Clausius-Mossotti and
Lorentz-Lorenz equations must be generalized into:

FLL ≡

n2(ω, T, ρ) − 1
n2(ω, T, ρ) + 2

=

ǫ(ω, T, ρ) − 1
ǫ(ω, T, ρ) + 2

4π
3

=

NAα(ω, T, ρ)ρm,

and one often uses a so called “virial expansion” of the type:

FLL = [AR(ω, T ) + BR(ω, T )ρm + CR(ω, T )ρ2

m + ...]ρm

where the suﬃx R indicates that AR, BR, CR are meant to be at optical and VUV wavelengths,
unlike Aǫ, Bǫ, Cǫ which are meant to be at the limit of very large wavelengths. The diﬀerent terms
of the virial expansion can be interpreted as follows: AR represents the atomic polarizability, BR
represents the interactions of two atoms, CR represents the interactions of three atoms, etc. If
instead of dealing with optical properties one deals with the ﬂuid equation of state, one often uses
the “compressibility”:

where ρm is the molar density. For a perfect gas Z = 1. For a real gas Z measures the deviations
from the perfect gas behaviour. A virial expansion can be introduced for Z:

Z = 1 + B2V (T )ρm + B3V (T )ρ2

m + B4V (T )ρ3

m + ...

Interatomic interactions are taken care of by the terms B2V , B3V , B4V , etc. It is important to note
that if the B’s are experimentally known for the ﬂuid, one can use a FLL virial expansion in terms
of the perfect gas molar density:

with coeﬃcient which can be expressed in terms of the ones of (6). The expression (6) becomes
simpler for Xenon taking into account the fact that this gas has no permanent dipole moment. It
can be shown [16] that this reﬂects into an AR(ω, T ) → AR(ω), no longer depending on temperature
and:

FLL = [AR(ω) + BR(ω, T )ρm + CR(ω, T )ρ2

m + ...]ρm.

(10)

The question is: can one use for Xenon, whatever its pressure and state, the simple Clausius-
Mossotti equation, so keeping only the ﬁrst term of the virial expansion and a linear relation with
density ? We brieﬂy discuss this point in section 5, after critically examining in section 4 the
existing literature and the experimental measurements on the relevant Xenon properties.

4 Experimental measurements available for Xe

Over the years several measurements were produced of quantities like the real and imaginary parts
of the dielectric constant (ǫ1, ǫ2), the real and the imaginary part of the refractive index (n, k),
the molecular polarizability α(ω, T, ρ), etc. over a large range of temperatures T and pressures P,
from dilute gas to liquid and solid phases. We present and discuss the available data and papers.

4.1 Experimental determination of the dielectric virial coeﬃcients of
atomic gases as a function of temperature. J. Hout and T.K. Bose
[22]

State: gas. Temperature: T = 323.15 K. Density: 0.13 < ρ < 0.79 g cm−3 equivalent to
10−3 < ρm < 6.0 10−3 mol cm−3. Method: Absolute measurement of the dielectric constant in ca-
pacitances (at low frequency). Result: Determination of the ﬁrst three virial coeﬃcients Aǫ, Bǫ, Cǫ.
At 323.15 K Aǫ = 10.122±0.002 cm3 mol−1, Bǫ = 32±2 cm6 mol−2, Cǫ = −3482±310 cm9 mol−3.
This measurement is made at very low frequency, so very far from the visible and the VUV re-
gion, and at densities which are about one hundred times smaller than the one of LXe. Moreover,
models were proposed for the dependence of Bǫ and Cǫ on the temperature T , which seem not to
be conﬁrmed by experimental data. It is remarkable that, if one, somewhat arbitrarily, computes
the Clausius-Mossotti relation in the visible and at densities up to a density ρm = 0.016 mol cm3
using Aǫ, Bǫ, Cǫ of this paper, one ﬁnds that A is not very diﬀerent from direct determinations
closer to the speciﬁed region [23] and that Bǫ and Cǫ introduce terms which produce rather small
deviations from the main A term.

4.2 Experimental determination of the refractivity virial coeﬃcients of

atomic gases. H.J. Achtermann et al. [23]

State: gas. Temperature: T = 298 − 348 K. Pressure: p < 4 × 102 Atm. Density: ρm <
0.016 mol cm−3. Method: Measurement of the refractive index by a diﬀerential interferometric

5

technique at λ = 633 nm. Result: Determination of the ﬁrst three virial coeﬃcients AR, BR, CR.
AR = 10.344 ± 0.002 cm3 mol−1, BR = 28.5 ± 0.5 cm6 mol−2, CR = −1802.0 ± 50.0 cm9 mol−3
at T = 348 K. The measurements were made in the visible region at densities close to the one of
LXe. One observes that AR is not very diﬀerent from Aǫ of the static measurement. The terms
related to BR and CR are small in respect of the main AR one at LXe densities.

4.3 Refractive indices of the condensed rare gases, argon, krypton and

xenon. A.C. Sinnock [17]

State:
liquid and solid Xe. Temperature: T = 30 − 178 K. Pressure: p ≈ 1 Atm. Density:
ρm = 0.0215−0.0280 mol cm−3. Method: Measurement of the refractive index by a total reﬂection
refractometer at λ = 546.1 nm. It studies Xe in the liquid and solid forms and in the visible region.
Result: Determination of the refractive index and determination of A from the Lorentz-Lorenz
function FLL. In LXe n ≈ 1.4 and A ≈ 10.5 ± 0.025 cm3 mol−1 at λ = 546.1 nm. The value of
A is remarkably similar to the ones in gas over a large density range. In a previous article [4],
similar measurements were performed also at diﬀerent wavelengths (361.2 < λ < 643.9 nm). The
Lorentz-Lorenz function, hence A, only varies ≈ 3% over the entire range studied; this implies that
the variation of n is ≈ 1.5% in the speciﬁed region.

4.4 Frequency-dependence of second refractivity virial coeﬃcient of small

molecules between 325 nm and 633 nm. U. Hohm [24]

State: gas. Temperature: Room temperature. Pressure: p < 3 Atm. Density: ρm < 1.25 10−4 mol cm3.
Method: Measurement of the refractive index n as a function of the gas density by a Michelson
interferometer between 325 < λ < 633 nm. Results: The ﬁrst two virial coeﬃcient AR, BR are de-
rived from the measurements. AR(633) = 10.43, AR(594) = 10.46, AR(543.5) = 10.52, AR(325.1) =
11.26 cm3 mol−1. 23.2 < BR < 25.5 cm6 mol−2. Apart from the normal dispersion as a function
of the wavelength, the values of AR and BR are remarkably stable whatever the Xe physical state.

4.5 Measurement of refractive indices of Neon, Argon, Krypton and
Xenon in the 253.7-140.4 nm wavelength range. Dispersion relations
and estimated oscillator strengths of the resonance lines. A. Bideau-
Mehu et al. [18]

State: gas. Temperature: T = 290 K. Pressure: p ≈ 1 Atm. Density: ρm = 4.49 −5 mol cm−3
Method: Measurement of the refractive index by a Fabry-Perot interferometer in the region 140.4 <
λ < 253.7 nm. One of the few precise measurement of the refractive index in the VUV and close
to the ﬁrst Xe absorption line. We saw that in the visible region A(ω) is rather stable around
10.5 cm3 mol−1 even for large density variations from dilute gas to the liquid and solid states. One
can expect that in the VUV the same is true, although normal dispersion from the visible to the
VUV region corresponds to a higher value for A(ω). From these measurements of the refractive
index one can derive a A(ω) ≈ 17.0 cm3 mol−1 at 175 nm. The LXe refractive index, in the
approximation of a Lorentz-Lorenz function linear in the density ρ, is predicted to be n ≈ 1.69 at
175 nm.

tillation light. L.M. Barkov [7]

State:
liquid Xenon. Temperature: T = 161.36 K. Pressure: p ≈ 0.81 Atm. Density: ρm ≈
2.26 10−2 mol cm−3. Method: Measurement of the refractive index by modiﬁcation of the focal-
ization of a lens when immersed in LXe, at λ = 180 nm. Result: n = 1.5655 ± 0.0024 ± 0.0078.
The quoted errors are probably underestimated.

4.7 Evolution of excitonic bands in ﬂuid xenon. P. Laporte and I.T.

Steinberger [19]

State: gas under pressure and liquid Xenon. Temperature: gas 275 < T < 292.7 K, liquid
T = 163 K. Pressure: gas 61.0 < p < 82.3 Atm, liquid p = 0.79 Atm. Density: gas 7.6 10−3 <
ρm < 1.45 10−2 mol cm−3, liquid ρm = 2.26 10−2 mol cm−3. Method: Study of the real and
imaginary parts of the refractive index by the reﬂection method, in the VUV wavelength region
115 < λ < 165 nm. Result: An important and precise study of the characteristics of the ﬁrst Xe

absorption lines and of their evolution as a function of the density. The appearance of new lines
and the broadening and displacement of normal lines is interpreted as due to Wannier excitons (see
at section 5). This can be clearly seen in ﬁg. 1 which shows the real and the imaginary parts of
the Xe refractive index as a function of the photon energy and (from bottom to top) for increasing
densities (the curves labelled from a to f ; the curve g is for LXe). The real part of n in the region
of LXe emission at λ = 175 nm cannot be easily extrapolated from these measurements, since one
should know the complex n both at lower and higher wavelengths. The data are of a suﬃciently
good quality to allow a test of the linearity on ρ of the Lorentz-Lorenz function on a large range
of densities (but at smaller wavelengths than the one of LXe emission).

4.8 VUV Optical Constants of Liquid and Solid Xenon at the Triple

Point. J.L. Subtil et al. [25]

State: liquid and solid Xenon. Temperature: 161.2 < T < 163.2 K. Pressure: p ≈ 1 Atm. Density:
ρm = 2.27 10−2 mol cm−3. Method: Study of the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index
by the reﬂection method, in the VUV wavelength region 112 < λ < 203 nm. Result: An important
and precise study of the characteristics of the ﬁrst Xe absorption lines and of their evolution in
the passage from the liquid to the solid state. A larger range of wavelengths was studied; the
LXe emission wavelength λ = 175 nm (7.1 eV) is therefore included and the corresponding LXe
refractive index is n = 1.71.
It is interesting to note that n = 1.69 is the value extrapolated
from the VUV gas measurements of Bideau-Mehu [18], assuming a linearity of the Lorentz-Lorenz
function with the density. The passage from liquid to solid Xe in the absorption region shows
eﬀects due to the Wannier excitons (see at section 5). The real and the imaginary parts of the
refractive index in LXe are shown in ﬁg. 2 over a wide range of photon energies.

4.9 Liquid Xenon Scintillation: Light Propagation and Detection. V.

Chepel [26]

State:
liquid Xenon. Temperature: T = 161.36 K. Pressure: p ≈ 1 Atm. Density: ρm =
2.26 10−2 mol cm−3. Method: Measurement of the index of refraction n and of the attenuation
length λatt at the emission wavelength λ = 178 nm by the study of light propagation in LXe over
a variable path of ≈ 10 cm. Result: n = 1.69 ± 0.02 and λatt = 36.4 ± 1.8 cm.

5 VUV light propagation in Liquid Xenon

The observation that the simple Clausius-Mossotti equation (depending only on the ﬁrst virial
coeﬃcient AR, whatever the ﬂuid density and state) might be valid for noble gases has already
been made [8]. At a closer look for Xe, it comes out that when one is approaching the region of the
Xe photon absorption lines, the Clausius-Mossotti equation is only marginally valid, but it can be
considered an acceptable approximation still at the LXe emission line. Xenon excited by ionizing
radiation emits at λ = 178 nm, that is photons with ¯hω = 7.0 eV . Photon absorption lines are
at higher energies starting from about 8.4 eV. The index of refraction n and its absorbitive part k
were extensively studied in the energy region from 7.8 to 8.8 eV over a wide pressure range, from
dilute gas to the liquid phase [19]. It was observed that, when the density reaches high values,
the absorption lines are distorted and broadened and a system of satellite lines appears, always at
energies lower than the main lines. This phenomenon is explained in terms of exciton formation 2
[19, 27, 28] and can be immediately related to higher density terms in the virial expansion. As a
consequence the Clausius-Mossotti relation is no longer linear in ρm at photon energies close to the
absorption lines. Nevertheless we checked that, when one moves to lower energies, the linearity in
ρm appears to be recovered and the values of α(ω, T, ρm) in (5) come out to be roughly the same,
whatever the pressure. This means that in the virial expansion:

FLL = [AR(ω) + BR(ω, T )ρm + CR(ω, T )ρ2

m + ...]ρm

(11)

the higher order terms give small contributions and that the AR term dominates. Since, as already
noted, some discrepancies exist among the optical data obtained by diﬀerent authors, in LXe at
7.0 eV, no fully reliable value of optical parameters at 7.0 eV is available or can be extrapolated
from higher energy measurements. The only conclusion we can reliably reach is that, in the energy
2by Wannier-excitons one means Rydberg levels, at energies between the valence band and the conduction band,

due to electron-hole bound states extending over ≈ 10 nm regions of the ﬂuid.

9

region around 7.0 eV, the simple Clausius-Mossotti equation is valid with good approximation and
that this statement rests on experimental data. This is shown in ﬁg. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 where all the
VUV results [18, 19, 25] were used to compute FLL = A(ω)ρm, in the hypothesis of the validity
of the simple Clausius-Mossotti equation. One can observe that for energies up to 8.1 eV the FLL
data are well ﬁtted by a linear dependence on the density, over quite a wide density range from
dilute gas to liquid. A(ω), the slope of the ﬁtted lines, corresponds to a rather constant value,
up to 8.1 eV, as it appears in ﬁg. 8. At higher photon energies, hence closer to the Xe photon
absorption lines, the ﬁts become increasingly worse, the linear model is rejected (and the error on
A(ω) is meaningless).

One can therefore conclude that, when ω is reasonably far from the absorption region, most of
the information obtained for gaseous Xenon in various physical conditions can be used for predicting
the optical properties of LXe at the emission wavelength [8]. The experimental determinations of
the refractive index in LXe, at the Xe emission wavelength of 178 nm [25, 26] and at 180 nm [7], are
presented in ﬁg.9 (a) and (b). The errors on n are the ones quoted in the papers with the exception
of [25], which has very small errors from point to point, but a systematic error on n which is not
clearly stated; we assumed a systematic error of ≈ 3%. The measured refractive index is compared
with an extrapolated value we derived, based on the simple Clausius-Mossotti equation utilizing
VUV data obtained in gas at low density [18]. One can observe a rather good agreement between
the measured n and the extrapolated value. The measurement corresponding to [7] gives a n value
at 180 nm which is somewhat low, but the experimental error, quoted in the paper, appears to us
over-optimistic.

Since we assumed (and checked) the validity of the simple Clausius-Mossotti equation, the
relation between n(ω) and A(ω) is ﬁxed. We present in ﬁg.10 the dispersive behaviour of A(ω) as
a function of the photon energy ¯hω. The open circles are the VUV measurements [18] obtained at
low density (p ≈ 1 Atm). The dashed line is the ﬁt to those points. The function used is:

with E = ¯hω, Pi the parameters resulting from the ﬁt and Ei the absorption line positions
(P1 = 71.23 eV2 cm3 mol−1, P2 = 77.75 eV2 cm3 mol−1, P3 = 1384.89 eV2 cm3 mol−1, E1 = 8.4
eV E2 = 8.81 eV and E3 = 13.2 eV). The star symbols are the values of A(ω) corresponding to the
ﬁts of ﬁg. 3, 4, obtained over the large density range from dilute gas to liquid Xe. The experimental
measurements of the refractive index n in LXe at 178 and 180 nm [7, 25, 26] are also shown by
their corresponding A(ω), as black symbols.

6 Relation between the Rayleigh scattering length and the

refractive index

We discuss now the relation between the index of refraction n and the Rayleigh scattering length
λR. For dilute Xe a simple relation is valid: [21]:

1
λR

≃

2k4
3πN

|(n − 1)|2

where k is the wave number of the radiation and N is the number of molecules per unit volume.
For a dense ﬂuid like LXe λR depends on density and temperature ﬂuctuations of the medium,
according to the Einstein’s expression [20]:

where c is the speed of light, κT is the isothermal compressibility, cv is the speciﬁc heat at constant
volume and K is the Boltzmann’s constant. This expression reduces to (13) in the case of dilute
gases.
Since Xenon is a non-polar ﬂuid, the second part of (14) comes out to be neglegible [8, 16, 4]. The
derivative appearing in the ﬁrst part of (14) can be computed from the Clausius-Mossotti equation

This equation establishes a useful relation between the index of refraction in pure LXe and the
Rayleigh scattering length, which can undergo an experimental test 3. Due to the form of the
relation and to error propagation, for a n ≈ 1.65 in LXe at λ ≈ 178 nm

σλR
λR ≈ 8.6 σn
n .

λR vs n from equation (15) (black circles) is presented in ﬁg.11. The input values for the
refractive index n(ω) are the ones obtained from a ﬁt to the low pressure VUV measurements [18].
The simple Clausius-Mossotti relation (4) (and its linearity as a function of ρm) is assumed to be
valid. There are only two published measurements of the Rayleigh scattering length in LXe at
178 nm which gave λR = 29 ± 2 cm [13] and λR = 36.4 ± 1.8 cm [26] (in this last case the refractive
index was also measured); we note that the two values are far apart. These determinations were
obtained for light produced by radioactive source excitation of LXe. This means that the measured
λR is an average over the 14 nm fwhm LXe emission spectrum. In checking the validity of equation
(15) an average over the LXe emission spectrum must therefore be performed. In ﬁg. 11 equation
(15) is also shown after averaging over the LXe emission spectrum (open circles); the diﬀerences
between the two curves are small. In the same ﬁgure the only available experimental measurement
of both n and λR [26] (black square) is compared with the extrapolated values for the same two
quantities (open triangle) obtained, as already explained, from the low-pressure VUV data and the
Clausius-Mossotti relation.

In the case of small amounts (ppm) of other rare gases, like Ar or Kr, added to Xe, (15)
preserves its validity and λR does not vary appreciably. This is not true in the case of absorbing
contaminants, as it was shown during the tests of the large prototype detector [1].

7 Conclusions

The experimental determination of LXe optical properties at the λ = 178 nm emission line is not
suﬃciently complete and reliable. The literature on optical characteristics of Xe in other spectral
regions and at various densities is critically examined. These data can be used to evaluate the
refractive index n and the Rayleigh scattering length λR in the VUV for LXe since the validity,
with good approximation, of the simple Clausius-Mossotti relation is conﬁrmed from dilute gas to
liquid densities. A useful relation is derived which directly links n and λR.

The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) for the International Linear Collider will need to measure about 200 track
points with a resolution close to 100 µm. A Micro Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) readout TPC could achieve the
desired resolution with existing techniques using sub-millimeter width pads at the expense of a large increase in the
detector cost and complexity. We have recently applied a new MPGD readout concept of charge dispersion to a
prototype GEM-TPC and demonstrated the feasibility of achieving good resolution with pads similar in width to
the ones used for the proportional wire TPC. The charge dispersion studies were repeated with a Micromegas TPC
ampliﬁcation stage. We present here our ﬁrst results on the Micromegas-TPC resolution with charge dispersion. The
TPC resolution with the Micromegas readout is compared to our earlier GEM results and to the resolution expected
from electron statistics and transverse diﬀusion in a gaseous TPC.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) for the future International Linear Collider will need to measure about
200 track points with a resolution of better than 100 µm. The resolution goal, close to the fundamental limit from
ionization electron statistics and transverse diﬀusion in the gas, is nearly two times better than what has been
achieved by conventional wire/pad TPCs. A TPC with a Micro Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) readout could, in
principle, reach the target resolution. However, it may require sub-millimeter wide pads resulting in a large increase
in the number of electronics channels, detector cost and complexity over conventional TPCs.

We have recently developed a new concept of position sensing from charge dispersion in MPGDs with a resistive
anode [1]. With charge dispersion wide readout pads similar in width to the ones used with proportional wire/cathode
pad TPCs can be used without sacriﬁcing resolution. This was demonstrated recently with cosmic ray tracks for a
TPC read out with a GEM with a resistive anode [2]. We present here new results on the cosmic ray track resolution
of a TPC read out with a Micromegas instrumented for charge dispersion with a resistive anode. The GEM and
the Micromegas TPC resolution measurements made with the resistive readout are compared to our earlier GEM-
TPC resolution results with a conventional readout [3] and to the expected resolution from transverse diﬀusion and
ionization electron statistics in a gaseous TPC.

2. MEASUREMENT SETUP AND ANALYSIS

A small 15 cm drift length test TPC used earlier with a conventional direct charge GEM readout [3] was modiﬁed
for charge dispersion studies. The readout endcap was modiﬁed such that it could accommodate either a GEM or
a Micromegas with a resistive anode [2] readout system. The gas used, Ar:CO2/90:10, was chosen to simulate the

Figure 1: Pad layout and observed signals for a cosmic ray track in a GEM-TPC with a resistive anode readout. Also shown
are simulated signals for the central row of pads. Detailed model simulation includes longitudinal and transverse diﬀusion, gas
gain, detector pulse formation, charge dispersion on a resistive anode and preampliﬁer rise and fall time eﬀects.

reduced transverse diﬀusion conditions of a TPC in a magnetic ﬁeld. Charge signals on 60 pads, 2 mm x 6 mm each
(see Figure 1), were read out using Aleph wire TPC preampliﬁers and digitized directly using 200 MHz custom built
8 bit FADCs.

Track reconstruction techniques used for the conventional direct charge GEM-TPC readout [3] cannot be used for
the resistive anode MPGD readout since non charge collecting pads nearby also have measurable signals. Not only
the observed amplitude, but also the pulse shape depends on the relative location of the pad with respect to the
track path. In theory, a ﬁrst principle determination of the track PRF is possible. For the present, we have chosen
to determine the PRF empirically from the internal consistency of cosmic ray track data.

For the purpose of analysis, the cosmic ray data were divided into two parts; one used for calibration and the other
for resolution studies. We use the calibration data set to determine the PRF associated with the pads in a given
row. The PRFs were determined for 15 seperate 1 cm wide regions in drift distance. Figure 2 shows examples of
PRFs for the GEM and the Micromegas readout. The measured PRFs have been parameterized with a ratio of two
symmetric 4th order polynomials:

P RF (x, Γ, ∆, a, b) =

1 + a2x2 + a4x4
1 + b2x2 + b4x4 ,

(1)

The coeﬃcients of the two 4th order polynomials a2 and a4, and b2 and b4 can be expressed in terms of the FWHM
Γ, the base width ∆ of the PRF, and two scale deﬁning parameters a and b.

The track ﬁtting parameters x0 and φ are determined by ﬁtting the PRF to the pad amplitudes for the full event
by χ2 minimization. The position in a row xrow is determined from a seperate one-parameter track ﬁt to this row

The PRF peak for longer drift distances is lower due to Z dependent normalization. Compared to the GEM, the PRF width
for the Micromegas is narrower due to the use of a higher surface resistivity anode and smaller diﬀusion after gain.

Micromegas. The bias is the mean diﬀerence xrow − xtrack as a function of xtrack = x0 + tan φ ∗ yrow, where yrow is
the y position of the row. A bias of up to 150 µm is observed which may be attributed to a non-uniform RC constant
due to inhomogeneities in the gap size and the resistivity of the foil. However, this bias is due to geometry only and
can easily be corrected. Figure 3 also shows the remaining bias after correction, which is negligible.

where s0 is the resolution at zero drift distance z. Here CD is the diﬀusion constant and Neﬀ is the eﬀective number
of track ionization electrons over the length of a pad. Neﬀ is not the average number of electrons. Rather, it is given
by: Neﬀ = 1/h
, where N is the number of electrons following the Landau distribution. N is determined from
the measured pad-signal amplitudes scaled using the most probable number of track ionization electrons obtained
from simulation.

Electronic noise and remaining systematic eﬀects contribute to the constant term s0. The constant term s0 is
about 75µm for the resistive readout for both the GEM and the Micromegas. It can be compared to the larger 97µm
constant term for the normal GEM readout.

As shown in Figure 4, the TPC resolution obtained with the resistive anode readout for both the GEM and the
Micromegas is better than our previous result with a conventional GEM readout [3], where at long drift distance the
observed resolution was about 40% worse than expected. Apart from the constant term, the dependence of resolution
on drift distance with the resistive readout follows the expectation from transverse diﬀusion in the gas and electron
statistics.

3. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In summary, the charge dispersion on a resistive anode improves the MPGD-TPC resolution signiﬁcantly over that
achievable with conventional direct charge readout for 2 mm wide pads. Bias errors due to RC inhomogeneities can
be corrected. With no magnetic ﬁeld, the measured dependence of resolution on drift distance follows the behavior
expected from transverse diﬀusion in the gas.

We wish to thank Ron Settles for lending us the ALEPH wire TPC ampliﬁers used in these measurements. The

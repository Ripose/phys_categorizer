Introduction

The thermal noise is expected to be one of the main limiting factors on the sensitivity of interfero-
metric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO and VIRGO. Thermal ﬂuctuations of internal modes
of the interferometer’s test masses and of suspension modes will dominate the noise spectrum at the
important frequency range between 50 and 200 Hz (seismic noise and photon shot noise dominate for
lower and higher frequencies, respectively). It is important to note that oﬀ-resonant thermal noise
level in high-quality systems is so low that it is unobservable in table-top experiments. Therefore,
predictions of the thermal-noise spectrum in LIGO are based on a combination of theoretical models
(with the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem of statistical mechanics serving as a basis) and experimental
measurements of quality factors of systems and materials involved. It is assumed that losses in the test
masses and suspensions will occur mainly due to internal friction in their materials, which is related
to anelasticity eﬀects in solids.

These informal notes comprise some basic results on the theory of anelasticity and thermal noise
in pendulum suspensions. This collection is by no means complete and focus on aspects which are
of interest for the author. The original results can be found in a number of books, research papers,
and theses. Some of these sources are listed in a short bibliography at the end of the present text; a
list of research papers (since 1990) devoted to various aspects of the thermal noise in interferometric
gravitational-wave detectors was prepared by the author and is available as a separate document.

2 Fluctuation-dissipation theorem

Consider a linear one-dimensional mechanical system with coordinate x(t). If a force F (t) acts on the
system, than in the frequency domain the force and the coordinate are related by

where H(ω) is the system response function. Then the spectral densities (see Appendix) are related
by

The impedance of the system is deﬁned as Z(ω) = F (ω)/v(ω) = F (ω)/[iωx(ω)]. Therefore, the
impedance and the response function are related by Z(ω) = 1/[iωH(ω)].

If the system is in equilibrium with the thermal bath of temperature
dissipation theorem (FDT) says that the spectral density of the thermal force is

is much larger than the energy quantum ¯hω. Using the FDT, one readily

equation of motion is

3 Anelasticity of solids

The FDT means that if a system has no dissipation channel, thermal ﬂuctuations will be zero. For an
ideal elastic spring without friction, ReZ(ω) = 0, and there are no ﬂuctuations: Sth
x (ω) = 0. Deviations
of solids from the ideal elastic behavior (anelasticity) will result in internal friction (dissipation) and
related thermal noise. For gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO, the test masses will be highly
isolated, so the internal friction in materials of which the masses and their suspensions are made is
believed to be the main source of dissipation and thermal noise.

3.1 The complex Young modulus and the loss function

Deformations of solids are usually described in terms of stress σ and strain ǫ (equivalents of mechanical
restoring spring force Fs and displacement x, respectively). Perfect elastic solids satisfy Hooke’s law

σ(t) = Eǫ(t),

where E is the (constant) Young modulus (an equivalent of the spring constant k). Anelasticity can be
described by introducing the complex Young modulus (or the complex spring constant in a mechanical
model). This is done in the frequency domain:

If an external force F (t) acts on a point mass m attached to such an anelastic spring, then the equation
of motion in the frequency domain is

The impedance of this system is

and Re Z(ω) = (1/ω)Im k(ω). Now, the FDT theorem gives the thermal noise spectrum:

is the so-called loss function. Note that φ = tan δ, where δ is the angle by which strain lags behind
stress. The loss function φ is a measure of the energy dissipation in the system. The rate at which
energy is dissipated is Fs ˙x. Then the energy dissipated per cycle by an anelastic spring is

Taking Fs = F0 cos ωt and x = x0 cos(ωt

For small φ (which is usually the case for the internal friction in materials used in detectors like
LIGO), it is customary to neglect the frequency dependence of kR. Then one can write k(ω) =
k[1 + iφ(ω)], where k = mω2
0 is a constant (and ω0 is the resonant frequency). Though this is a good
approximation for many practical reasons, in general kR must be frequency-dependent because real
and imaginary parts of k(ω) are related via the Kramers-Kronig relations.

3.2 Simple models

3.2.1 Perfect elastic solid

3.2.2 Maxwell solid

Here we consider some simple models of anelasticity in solids. Neither of them gives a full description
of the behavior of a real material, but nevertheless they are useful from the didactic point of view.

The mechanical model of perfect elastic solid is a lossless spring. In this case σ = Eǫ, so φ = 0. There
is no dissipation and no thermal noise.

The mechanical model of Maxwell solid is a lossless spring in series with a dashpot. The dashpot
provides a source of viscous friction with σ = η ˙ǫ. Then for Maxwell solid stress and strain are related
by equation

˙ǫ = E

−1 ˙σ + η

−1σ.

This equation shows that for a constant strain, stress decays exponentially. On the other hand, for a
constant stress, strain increases linearly, which is a very wrong description for crystalline solids. Going
to the frequency domain, one obtains

E(ω) =

and φ(ω) = E/(ηω).

3.2.3 Voigt-Kelvin solid

The mechanical model corresponding to Voigt-Kelvin anelastic solid consists of a lossless spring and a
dashpot in parallel, which corresponds to a damped harmonic oscillator. The relation between stress
and strain reads

η ˙ǫ + Eǫ = σ.

For a constant stress σ0, strain changes exponentially with the decay time η/E from its initial value ǫ0
to the equilibrium (Hooke) value σ0/E. For a constant strain, stress is also constant, like in Hooke’s
law. This is a good description for materials like cork, but it is not suitable for metals. In the frequency
domain, one has

E(ω) = E + iηω,

φ(ω) = (η/E)ω.

Substituting this φ into Eq. (3.5), we ﬁnd

3.2.4 Standard anelastic solid

Though the model of standard anelastic solid (SAS) does not gives a complete account of properties
of real metals, it describes quite well basic mechanisms responsible for anelastic eﬀects. In fact, if a
dissipation mechanism has characteristic relaxation times for strain upon a constant stress and for
stress upon a constant strain, then the SAS model gives an adequate description. The corresponding
mechanical model consists of a spring in parallel with a Maxwell unit (which is a spring in series with a
dashpot). Let E1 and E2 be the Young moduli of the separate spring and of the spring in the Maxwell
unit, respectively, and η be the dashpot constant, as usual. Then stress and strain are related by the
following equation:

E2
η

E1E2
η

σ + ˙σ =

ǫ + (E1 + E2) ˙ǫ.

For a constant strain ǫ0, stress decays exponentially from its initial value σ0 to the equilibrium (Hooke)
value E1ǫ0:

σ(t) = E1ǫ0 + (σ0

τǫ = η/E2.

Analogously, for a constant stress σ0, strain decays exponentially from its initial value ǫ0 to the

E1 is called the relaxed Young modulus. Transforming to the frequency domain, one

Thermoelastic damping mechanism Zener pointed out that the SAS model with

is suitable for describing processes in which the relaxation of stress and strain is related to a diﬀusion
process. One example of such a process is the so-called thermoelastic damping. Consider a specimen
which is a subject to a deformation in such a way that one part of it expands and the other contracts
(e.g., a wire of a pendulum which bends near the top while the pendulum swings). The temperature
increases in the contracted part and decreases in the expanded part. The resulting thermal diﬀusion
leads to the dissipation of energy. This anelastic eﬀect can be described by the SAS model with the
thermal relaxation strength and relaxation time given by

3.3 Boltzmann’s superposition principle

While the SAS has certain general features in common with actual solids, it does not reproduce
precisely the behavior of any real metal. Simple models considered above can be generalized by a
theory which only assumes that the relation between stress and strain is linear. This assumption

was expressed by Boltzmann in the form of a superposition principle: If the deformation x1(t) was
produced by the force F1(t) and the deformation x2(t) was produced by the force F2(t), then the force
F1(t) + F2(t) will produce the deformation x1(t) + x2(t). On the other hand, the deformation can be
regarded as the independent variable. In this case the superposition principle states: If the force F1(t)
is required to produce the deformation x1(t) and the force F2(t) is required to produce the deformation
x2(t), then the force F1(t) + F2(t) will be required to produce the deformation x1(t) + x2(t).

Let us introduce the quantity λ(t) which is called the creep function and is the deformation resulting
from the sudden application at t = 0 of a constant force of magnitude unity. During an inﬁnitesimal
interval from t to t + dt, the applied force F (t) can be approximated by a constant force of magnitude
˙F dt. Then the superposition principle gives

Conversely, we may regard the deformation as a speciﬁed function of time. Let us deﬁne the quantity
κ(t) which is called the stress function and is the force which must be applied in order to produce
the step-function deformation x(t) = Θ(t) (here Θ(t) is 1 for t
0 and 0 for t < 0). Then the linear
relationship is

≥

The relation between the creep function and the strain function is rather complicated; in general they
satisfy the following inequality

(3.29)
For constant κ(t) = k we recover Hooke’s law F (t) = kx(t) and then λ(t) = k−1. Integrating by parts
in Eq. (3.28), we obtain another expression of the superposition principle,

f (t) = κ(0)δ(t) + ˙κ(t).

The relationship between the force and the deformation becomes very simple in the frequency

domain. Toward this end we introduce the functions

fp(t) = f (t)Θ(t),

κp(t) = κ(t)Θ(t),

λp(t) = λ(t)Θ(t),

(3.32)

which are zero for t < 0. Using these functions, one can expand the upper integration limit in
Eqs. (3.27), (3.28), and (3.30) to
. Then we just can use the fact that a convolution in the time
domain is a product in the frequency domain. This gives

∞

F (ω) = iωκp(ω)x(ω) = fp(ω)x(ω).

Thus the Fourier transform of the stress function is simply related to the complex spring constant of
Eq. (3.2):

k(ω) = fp(ω) = iωκp(ω).

which coincides with Eq. (3.20).

4 Calculation of the thermal noise spectrum for a pendulum sus-

pension

For a point mass m attached to an anelastic spring with the complex spring constant k(ω), we found
a simple result

Z(ω) =

k(ω)

mω2

,

−
iω

which can be used in the FDT to derive the thermal noise spectrum Sth
x (ω) as given by Eq. (3.5).
However, the question is how to ﬁnd the thermal noise spectrum for more complicated systems, e.g.,
for pendulum suspensions of test masses in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO.

In the literature we can ﬁnd two diﬀerent approaches: the “direct” application of the FDT to
the whole system and the method which is based on decomposing a complicated system into a set of
normal modes. Below, we describe brieﬂy both of these approaches.

4.1 The direct approach

In brief, this method can be described as follows. First, one should write equations of motion for the
whole system and ﬁnd the impedance Z(ω). Then the FDT provides the thermal noise spectrum:

The impedance Z(ω) contains the information about resonances of the system. The dissipation enters
by taking the Young moduli of the materials to be complex:

or, for simplicity, E(ω) = E0[1 + iφ(ω)], where E0 is a constant. The loss function φ(ω) is obtained
from experiments on the anelasticity of materials used in the system (e.g., on the suspension wires).
Of course, the resulting noise spectrum Sth

x (ω) depends very much on what form of φ(ω) is used.

4.2 The normal-mode decomposition

The normal-mode decomposition is a more traditional approach. Consider, for example, an one-
dimensional system of linear mass density ρ(z) and total length L, which is described in terms of the
normal modes ψn(z). These modes satisfy the orthonormality relation,

and an arbitrary displacement x(z, t) can be decomposed as

Here, qn(t) are the mode coordinates which satisfy

is the generalized force produced by the force density f (z, t) applied to the system.

This decomposition eﬀectively replaces the complicated system by a collection of oscillators, and

each of them satisﬁes

The dissipation is included by taking

where φn(ω) are the loss functions. Then we can write

Let us assume that the force is applied at the end of the system z = L, such that f (z, t) =
L). Then the generalized forces are Fn(t) = F (t)ψn(L), and we can substitute Eq. (4.9) into

F (t)δ(z
the Fourier transform of Eq. (4.4) to obtain

mn = [ψn(L)]−2 attached to an anelastic spring with the complex spring constant kn(ω) = kn[1 +
iφn(ω)], such that the resonant angular frequencies are ωn =
kn/mn. So, in order to obtain the
thermal noise spectrum one needs to ﬁnd all the normal modes, their eﬀective masses, resonant
frequencies, and loss functions.

4.3 Modes of a pendulum suspension

The most important modes of a pendulum suspension are the pendulum mode, the rocking mode, and
the violin modes. We will not consider here the rocking mode because for multi-loop suspensions the
rocking motion of the test mass is essentially suppressed. The loss function of each mode depends on
the type of mode and on anelastic properties of the pendulum wire.

4.3.1 The pendulum mode

For the pendulum mode, we will assume that the mass of the wire is much smaller than the mass of
the bob (which is the test mass) and that the bob is attached near its center of mass. Also, the angle
by which the pendulum swings is considered to be very small. Then the pendulum may be modelled
as an oscillator of the resonant angular frequency

where g is the acceleration due to the Earth gravity ﬁeld, and L is the pendulum length.

E

The energy of the pendulum consists of two parts: the gravitational energy

gr and the elastic
energy
el due to the bending of the wire. The gravitational energy is lossless; provided that all
the losses due to interactions with the external world (friction in the residual gas, dumping by eddy
currents, recoil losses into the seismic isolation system, friction in the suspension clamps, etc.) are made

where M is the pendulum mass and θm is the maximum angle of swing. The elastic energy depends
on how many wires are used and how they are attached to the pendulum. For one wire, the ﬁber in
the pendulum mode will bend mostly near the top, with the bending elastic energy

Here, T is the tension force in the wire (T = M g for one wire), E is the Young modulus of the wire
material, and I is the moment of inertia of the wire cross section (I = 1

radius r). Using these results, one ﬁnds for a single-wire pendulum:

This result can be easily generalized for the case when the test muss is suspended by N wires. Then
the elastic energy

In Eq. (4.23) we assumed that all the wires are in one plane: a plane through the center of mass of
the pendulum, whose normal is parallel to the direction of swing. (Note that in such an conﬁguration
one should take into account the rocking mode of the test mass.) In this arrangement, the pendulum
mode causes bending of the wires mostly at the top. If one uses a number of wire loops along the
test mass length, then the rocking mode is essentially suppressed and the wires bend both at the top
and the bottom. Therefore, the bending elastic energy of the multi-loop conﬁguration is given by
multiplying the result of Eq. (4.21) by 2N ,

Then the energy ratio is

The contribution of the pendulum mode to the thermal noise spectrum is obtained from Eq. (4.14)

This expression takes into account only the contribution to the elastic energy due to wire bending

to wire bending along its length, which leads to Eq. (4.32).

For the one-loop suspension conﬁguration, the elastic energy of the lowest violin modes is about
twice of that for the pendulum mode (for the last one the wires bend only at the top while for the
former ones the wires bend at both ends). In the multi-loop conﬁguration, the elastic energy of the

5 Experiments on anelasticity eﬀects for pendulum suspensions

5.1 Basic types of experiments

In order to predict the thermal noise ﬂuctuations in pendulum suspensions, two basic types of exper-
iments are performed:

1. Investigations of anelastic properties of wires made of various materials, in order to determine

the wire loss function φw(ω).

13

2. Measurements of quality factors (Q = φ−1 at a resonance) for the pendulum and violin modes

of actual suspensions, in order to verify the relationships

φp(ω) = ξpφw(ω),

φv(ω) = ξvφw(ω).

(5.1)

Early experiments showed serious discrepancy between the measured quality factors and those pre-
dicted using Eq. (5.1). It was discussed that this discrepancy may happen due to stress-dependent
eﬀects. However, it was shown later that the internal losses of the wires are almost independent of the
applied stress. Many recent experiments proved that the above discrepancy appears due to serious
losses in the clamps. A smart design of clamps can be used to reduce these excess losses and then
predictions of Eq. (5.1) are quite accurate. A very promising possibility is the use of monolithic or
semi-monolithic suspensions. The design of clamps plays a crucial role in the reduction of the thermal
noise of the test mass suspensions.

5.2 Internal losses in wire materials

A number of experiments were performed to study internal losses of various wire materials (e.g., steel,
tungsten, fused quartz, and some others). The main drawback of many of these experiments is a
small number of frequencies for which φw was measured. Also, there are serious discrepancies between
results of diﬀerent experiments. Therefore, the exact frequency dependence of φw is still unclear for
many materials. Below, we brieﬂy review results of some recent experiments.

Kovalik and Saulson, 1993 Method: Quality factors were measured for resonances of freely sus-
pended wires. Materials: Tungsten, silicon, sapphire, fused quartz. Results: Insigniﬁcant frequency
dependence for tungsten; for fused quartz, measured φw are above those predicted by the thermoelastic
damping (TED) for some frequencies and near TED for others; sapphire and silicon showed behavior
consistent with TED.

Saulson et al., 1994 Method: Quality factors were measured for an inverted pendulum of tunable
length. Material: Free-Flex cross-spring ﬂexure made of crossed steel strips. Results: In agreement
with a frequency-independent φw.

Gillespie and Raab, 1994 Method: Quality factors were measured for resonances of freely sus-
pended wires. Material: Steel music wires. Results: A constant value of φw for low frequencies (from
30 to 150 Hz). For higher frequencies (from 150 Hz to 2 kHz) φw increases with ω, like TED predicts,
but the measured value φmeas is well above φTED. These results may be explained by the formula
φmeas = φTED + φex, where φex is a frequency-independent excess loss.

Rowan et al., 1997 Method: Quality factors were measured for resonances of ribbons ﬁxed at one
end. Material: Fused quartz ribbons. Results: Data were obtained for 5 resonances in the range from
6 to 160 Hz. φmeas is well above φTED for lower frequencies (below 30 Hz), and in agreement with
TED for higher frequencies (above 80 Hz).

Dawid and Kawamura, 1997 Method: Quality factors were measured for the violin modes of
wires ﬁxed at both ends in a “guitar”-type apparatus. Materials: Invar, titanium, steel, tungsten
and several other metals. Results: φ−1
meas was proportional to √T , in accordance with the formula
φv = (2/L)

EI/T φw for frequency-independent φw.

14

Huang and Saulson, 1998 Method: Quality factors were measured for resonances of freely sus-
pended wires. Materials: Steel and tungsten. For steel, φmeas coincides with the predictions of TED
(the characteristic Debye-peak frequency dependence). Some diﬀerences were found between proper-
ties of annealed wires (φmeas slightly above φTED) and “curly” wires (φmeas slightly below φTED). The
diﬀerence can be explained by modiﬁcations of thermal properties. For tungsten wires, φmeas only
slightly increases with frequency; the loss function increases with the wire diameter, as should be for
TED at frequencies well below ¯f .

6 Conclusions

It is seen that predictions of the spectral density for thermal ﬂuctuations in pendulum suspensions
depend strongly on the type of the dissipation mechanism. Sources of external losses (friction in the
residual gas, dumping by eddy currents, recoil losses into the seismic isolation system, friction in the
suspension clamps, etc.) should be eliminated by careful experimental design. In particular, results
of many recent experiments show that excess losses in clamps may seriously deteriorate the quality
factors of suspension resonances. When external losses are made suﬃciently small, the main source
of dissipation is the internal friction in the wires due to anelastic eﬀects. The thermal noise spectrum
depends on the form of the loss function. Unfortunately, the exact frequency dependence of the wire
loss function φw(ω) is not yet completely understood. In many experiments φw was measured only
at few frequencies and experimental uncertainty of results was often quite large. Moreover, there is a
contradiction between results of diﬀerent experiments. Therefore, it is very diﬃcult to make certain
conclusions about the behavior of φw(ω). In particular, it is unclear if clamp losses are negligible in
experiments with freely suspended wires, as is usually assumed. Certainly, there is a room for more
experiments on anelastic properties of wires, in order to clarify the issue of internal friction in the
frequency range of interest for gravitational-wave detection.

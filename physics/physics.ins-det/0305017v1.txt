FEATHER:
a fast intra-pulse feedback system for the JLC.

Nicolas Delerue
JLC Group, KEK
Talk given at the 8th Accelerator and Particle Physics Institute

APPI (Japan), February 2003

Ground motion at the Future JLC detector may aﬀect beam alignment and
cause huge luminosity loss. The FEATHER (FEedback AT High Energy
Requirements) project addresses this problem by designing a fast
intra-pulse feedback system that will correct the observed beam oﬀset.

1 Need for a fast feed-

back system

Ground motion arises from both natural
and human activities. At frequencies higher
than a few tens of hertz most of the motion
comes from “cultural noise” (ie. human ac-
tivities). At these frequencies the ampli-
tude of the ground motion, a few nanome-
is comparable to the vertical beam
ters,
size proposed for the JLC. This means that
beams may be misaligned, leading to loss
of luminosity (see ﬁgure 1) and poorer per-
formances for the collider. The eﬀects of
beam misalignment have been studied us-
ing CAIN [?].

This problem will partly be addressed
during the site selection (see [?]) but it is
unavoidable that some noise will remain (at
least the noise arising from the accelerator
operation). The ﬁgure 2 shows the accept-
able noise amplitude for various frequency
range.

of a bunch to correct the same beam. Fur-
thermore, the beam size is of the order of
a few nanometers, and most displacements
are well beyond the reach of current Beam
Position Monitors (BPM). But after the in-
teraction point (IP) both beams are de-
ﬂected with a deﬂection angle deﬁned by
their misalignment (see ﬁgure 3). Thus it
is easier to measure the misalignment on
the outgoing beam after the IP to correct
the incoming beam. This can be done ei-
ther on only one arm or on the two arms
of the collider. The two arms solution re-
duces the correction required but is more
complicated as good and fast communica-
tion between the two systems is required to
avoid “opposite” corrections.

Earlier studies of simple model of feed-
back have been done in 1999 [?, ?]. These
studies used a kicker with a slow rise time
(ie. high capacity), diﬀerent from what is
usually used at KEK. The beam oﬀset as a
function of the bunch number as calculated
in these studies can be seen on ﬁgure 5.

lution minimizing the luminosity loss is to
use a moderate gain that will lead to a small
overcorrection (green dashed line).

This is modiﬁed if a fast rise time kicker
(as those available at KEK) is used. The
ﬁgure 6 shows the beam oﬀset as a function
of the bunch number in that case.

Figure 5: Oﬀset (top) and luminosity loss
(bottom) as a function of the bunch number
in a train corrected using a simple model of
feedback with a slow rise time kicker and an
initial oﬀset of 2 σy.

As the kicker will have a slow rise time
there will be an initial rising period dur-
ing which the kicker can not fully correct
the beam oﬀset. With a high gain (red
line), when full correction is achieved, the
beam reaching the BPM is still not fully
corrected and thus the system will “over-
correct” the beam position, leading to os-
cillations as seen on ﬁgure 5. This can be
avoided by lowering the gain of the cor-
recting device, overcorrection will then be
avoided but converging time will be much
slower (blue dotted line). An average so-

bunch number in a train corrected with a
simple model of feedback using a fast rise
time kicker. Vertical units are arbitrary.
After a few oscillations the system con-
verges to an equilibrium state diﬀerent from
the full correction state.

Now, we can see that once the ﬁrst
bunches reach the BPM, correction is ap-
plied to the beam to reduce its oﬀset.
But when the corrected bunches (with a
small oﬀset) reach the BPM, the correc-
tion applied becomes small (or even 0 if the
bunches are fully corrected). The system
will then oscillate between high and low cor-
rection state.
If the gain applied is lower
than 1, the system will eventually converge
to an equilibrium state diﬀerent from the

full correction state.

Animations showing the behavior of this
model with these 2 kinds of kicker can be
seen on the FEATHER website [?].

2.2 Delayed model of feedback

To avoid the oscillations featured by the
“simple model”, a “memory” can be added
so that when corrected bunches reach the
BPM, the previously applied correction is
remembered and can be again applied.

The memory needs to remember the cor-
rection applied around 10 bunches ago,
which means keeping the information just
during a few tens of nanoseconds. This can
be done simply by adding a long wire in the
circuit as a “delay” loop (see ﬁgure 7). The
beam position as a function of the bunch
number can be seen on ﬁgure 8.

lations previously observed. But the choice
of the correction to be applied as function of
a given oﬀset will trigger another problem
as the relation between the position mea-
sured and the beam oﬀset is non linear. If
the correction is tuned for low oﬀsets the
high oﬀsets will be undercorrected (red line
on the bottom plot of ﬁgure 8). On the
other hand, tuning the system for high oﬀ-
sets would lead to overcorrection and oscil-
lations at low oﬀset (dashed green line on

the bottom plot of ﬁgure 8).

Improved model of feed-
back

The delayed model of feedback system can
be further improved to suppress the prob-
lem arising from the non linearities by ﬁt-
ting lines on the ﬁgure 3 showing the re-
lation between oﬀset and deﬂection angle.
This ﬁt is shown on ﬁgure 9. It can be real-
ized with an array of non linear components
starting to operate at a diﬀerent threshold
as shown on ﬁgure 10.

tions in Perl (and later cross-checked with
Matlab).
It has not yet been possible to
test these models in real beam conditions,
however, the technical feasibility of these
circuits has been checked on a test bench
using a pulse generator.

3.1.1 Simple feedback

As the simple model of feedback just com-
putes a correction from a given position, its
electronic layout is fairly simple: as shown
on ﬁgure 11 it should consist simply of an
ampliﬁer whose gain is adjusted to the re-
quired correction. As tunable ampliﬁer are
not easily available on the market, it is eas-
ier to amplify more than needed and then
tune the gain with well chosen attenuators
as shown on ﬁgure 12. On that ﬁgure, the
device used to merge the signal from the
BPM antenna and to split it to both kicker
strips is also shown.

This design has been tested and its per-
formances can be seen on ﬁgure 13. The
response time measured is of the order of
15 ns.

posed for the simple model. In red and blue

of the circuit and in yellow and green are the

3.1.2 Delayed feedback

The delay loop to be added to the “delayed
feedback” circuit could be made of a simple
cable, but as there are losses, an ampliﬁer
must be included in the design to ensure
that the delay loop has a gain of 1. The
noise ﬁgure of this ampliﬁer must be low to
avoid accumulating and amplifying noise in
the loop. The circuit layout is shown on
ﬁgure 14.

The ﬁgure 15 shows the input and out-
put that were measured with this layout,
using a delay loop with a length equiva-
lent to 3 pulses. It can clearly be seen that
the information is “accumulated” in the de-
lay loop while bunches arrives with oﬀset
(which means that the correction is not yet

enough) and then that once full correction
is reached (no more signal on the input) al-
most the same level of correction is kept
(the decay comes from the fact that the gain
of the delay loop was not matched to one).

3.1.3 Improved feedback: Non lin-
earity at RF frequencies.

A key issue to check the feasibility of the
improved model of feedback is the possibil-
ity of generating a non linear response out
of the components available at the working
frequency.

This non-linearity can be simulated by
using a diode. The blocking tension of this
diode can by shifted by adding a DC (or low
frequency) component to the incoming sig-

ter the diode, as shown on ﬁgure 16. Using
this design, a kink of various angle has been
observed when a normal triangle signal was
sent through the circuit (see ﬁgure 17 ).

3.2 Kicker requirements and

signal ﬁltering

With the kickers currently available at KEK
the tension required to kick the beam is of
the order of the kilovolt. The only avail-
able ampliﬁers able to deliver this power
does not work in the hundreds of megahertz
range and thus the signal must be brought
to a lower frequency.

This can be done by using a speciﬁc ﬁl-
ter that reduces the frequency of the signal.
It has been checked that the delayed model
design remains valid with such ﬁlter (see ﬁg-
ure 18).

are arbitrary. The upper line corresponds to
an incoming train of bunches. The second
line corresponds to the diﬀerence between
the 2 BPM antennas, the third to the sig-
nal in the delay loop and the fourth to the
signal sent to the kicker. The length of the
delay loop is equivalent to the interval be-
tween 3 pulses, thus the signal in the delay
loop increases by steps of 3 pulses. The de-
cay in the delay after the end of incoming
train comes from the fact that the gain in
the loop is lower than 1.

3.3 Online measurements

The response of a BPM as a function of the
Beam Position has been measured at the
ATF (here a “button” type BPM was used)
as shown on ﬁgure 19.

Other beam tests have been done to mea-

sure how the trajectory is modiﬁed by a
given kick. Initial results were not conclu-
sive due to insuﬃcient power but the eﬀect
of the kick was later observed with a more
powerful pulse generator (see ﬁgure 20). To
be able to check the full feedback system a

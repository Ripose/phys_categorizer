Two diﬀerent technologies are considered for the Beam Calorimeters of the ILC detector. Simulation studies of the
performance have been done for a diamond-tungsten sandwich calorimeter and for a homogeneous heavy element
crystal calorimeter with optical ﬁber readout. Studies of the stability and the linearity of a polycrystalline diamond
were done for the diamond-tungsten option. For the heavy crystal option the light yield reduction due to the wavelength
shifting ﬁber readout was studied.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Beam Calorimeter (BeamCal) will be positioned just adjacent to the beampipe in front of the ﬁnal focus
quadrupoles covering very low angles (4-28) mrad. One of the purposes of the BeamCal is to serve a fast beam
diagnostics detecting e+e− pairs originated from the beamstrahlung photons conversion. The calorimeter provides a
good hermiticity of the whole detector and allows to measure high energy electrons down to the very low angles. The
calorimeter also shields the inner part of the detector from backscattered beamstrahlung remnants and synchrotron
radiation.

The beamstrahlung remnants create huge energy deposition in the BeamCal. The total energy deposited in the
calorimeter is about ∼20 TeV per bunch crossing for nominal TESLA beam parameters and detector design. The
deposited energy varies signiﬁcantly with radius and azimuthal angle, providing areas of very high occupancy. The
integrated radiation dose of up to 10 Gy/year is expected for these areas [1] requiring radiation hardness to the
BeamCal sensitive material.

Measurements of high energetic electrons or photons on top of the beamstrahlung remnants require a high transver-

sal granularity and a small Moliere radius of the calorimeter.

One of the considered technologies for the BeamCal is a diamond-tungsten sandwich calorimeter. Polycrystalline
Chemical Vapour Deposition (pCVD) diamonds have been shown to be suﬃciently radiation hard [2]. A sketch of a
possible calorimeter structure is shown in Figure 1.

Another technology considered for the BeamCal design is a heavy element homogeneous calorimeter where scin-
tillator segments are read out with optical ﬁbers. A longitudinal segment of the crystal calorimeter is shown in
Figure 2. Every piece of the segment is optically isolated from the neighbors and read out with a wavelength shifting
ﬁber. The ﬁber is routed to the back of the calorimeter through optically isolated grooves in the adjacent rear parts.
As a possible material for the calorimeter lead tungstenate (PbWO4) is considered in the simulations.

2. SIMULATION OF THE CALORIMETER PERFORMANCE

The beamstrahlung is simulated using the Monte Carlo program Guinea Pig [3]. Single high energy electrons
are simulated with energies between 50 and 250 GeV using the GEANT3 [4] based detector simulation package
BRAHMS [5].

The reconstruction procedure was tuned to provide less than 1% of fake events. The fake rate was estimated by

applying the reconstruction algorithm to a pure background events.

calorimeter. Between the tungsten disks diamond sensors
are interspersed.

ment of the crystal calorimeter. Each piece is connected
to an optical ﬁber routed to the back of the calorimeter.

2.1. Diamond-Tungsten Calorimeter

The simulated calorimeter consists of 30 tungsten disks alternating with diamond sensor layers. The thickness
of the tungsten disks is chosen to be 3.5 mm (one radiation length), the diamond layers are 0.5 mm thick. Every
diamond layer is segmented into pads. The number of pads in a ring increases with the radius keeping pad dimensions
of about half a Moliere radius (5 mm).

Figure 3 shows a detection eﬃciency as a function of the radius for electrons of diﬀerent energies. The eﬃciencies
are obtained at azimuthal angle around φ = 90o where the background level is high. Figure 4 shows a map of cells
where the detection eﬃciency is less than 90%. Electron energies between 50 and 250 GeV are considered.

2.2. Heavy Scintillator Calorimeter

The study of a lead tungstenate calorimeter performance are done the same way. The transverse segmentation
is chosen to be of about half a Moliere radius (∼ 1 cm). Every segment was divided longitudinally into tree pieces
as it is shown in Figure 2. The length of the pieces is 3, 9 and 8 radiation lengths starting with a front side of the
calorimeter. To investigate the inﬂuence of the ﬁbers and wrapping material on the calorimeter performance, an
ideal homogeneous calorimeters has been studied as well as a realistic one. Figure 5 shows a cross-section of a frontal
calorimeter segment with wrapping and an attached ﬁber as it was implemented for the realistic simulation.

Figure 3 shows the eﬃciency to detect a 100 GeV electron in the low background region at azimuthal angle around
φ = 0o as a function of the radius. The deterioration of the performance due to the wrapping and ﬁber material is
clearly seen.

3. SENSOR STUDIES FOR DIAMOND-TUNGSTEN OPTION

Polycrystalline CVD diamond samples produces in Fraunhofer Institute (Freiburg, Germany), have been tested for
the diamond-tungsten option of the BeamCal. The samples have 10x10 mm2 area with a two-layer Ti/Au metalization
and thickness between 200 and 500 µm.

Measurements of the charge collection eﬃciency under low irradiation doses have been done in order to check
stability of the signal. A diamond response to irradiation with a 90Sr beta-source was monitored up to absorbed dose
of at least 20 Gy. The voltage applied during the irradiation corresponded to the electric ﬁeld of 1 V/µm.

Top plot of Figure 7 shows the mean values of the 90Sr spectrum obtained with diamond samples as a function of
the absorbed dose. The charge collection eﬃciency stabilized after the dose of about 15 Gy. Stability of current in
the high voltage circuit during is shown on bottom plot of Figure 7.

Figure 8 shows results for another diamond sample. The current increased with the absorbed dose and depended

on the dose rate. Stabilization of the current and charge collection eﬃciency has been obtained at about 20 Gy.

The linearity of diamond response has been tested with a hadron beam of about 4 GeV at the CERN PS. Beam
spills of about 10 ns duration with variable intensity (up to 107 mips per a spill) produced an integrated signal in
a diamond sample. A scintillator with two photomultipliers attached was used as a trigger and a reference for the
linearity measurements. An example of the measurement results is shown in Figure 9.

for three samples as function of the absorbed dose.

tion of the absorbed dose. The dose accumulation rate

4. STUDIES OF FIBER READOUT FOR CRYSTAL OPTION

4.1. Light Yield Reduction and Crosstalk Measurements

Measurements of light yield reduction due to the ﬁber readout have been done in order to test the feasibility of the
concept. The measurements are done using plastic scintillator (Bicron BC-408 [6]) and lead glass as the test samples.
These two materials have diﬀerent light production mechanism: in the plastic scintillator light is produced due to
scintillation, in lead glass via the ˇCerenkov eﬀect. Light produced in a crystal under tests due to traversing cosmic
muons is read out by a photomultiplying tube coupled to the scintillator directly (Setup ”a” in Figure 10, left) or
via a Bicron BCF-19A wavelength shifting ﬁber (Setup ”b” in Figure 10, left). An example of the obtained spectra
are shown in Figure 10, right. The ﬁber readout reduced the light yeld to (14±4)% for plastic scintillator and to
(16±7)% for lead glass.

and read out directly (Setup ”a”) or via a wavelength shifting ﬁber (Setup ”b”). The signal spectra obtained from relativistic
cosmic muons for Setup ”a” and Setup ”b” (Right).

To estimate the crosstalk for the considered readout, measurements with a plastic scintillator segmented into three
pieces were done. Every segment had one readout ﬁber attached and wrapping for optical insulation. The ﬁbers
were routed to one side as it is shown in Figure 2 and are optically isolated from the neighboring segments.

All three ﬁbers were read out with photomultipliers. Setup ”b” shown in Figure 10 was rearranged such to produce
a trigger signal only for muons traversing the ﬁrst segment, where all three ﬁbers were routed through. The signals
from the other two ﬁbers were monitored. The crosstalk level was estimated to be less than 1%.

4.2. Simulation Studies of Light Yield Reduction

The transport of optical photons generated in a crystal was simulated using GEANT4 [7]. Scintillation and
ˇCerenkov radiation as well as a set of optical processes including the wavelength shifting mechanism were taken into
account. The wavelength shifting process is available since version 6.0 of GEANT4. The simulation is done for the
plastic scintillator and lead glass crystals of the same geometry as in the measurements of light yield reduction. A
cross-section of the crystal is shown in Figure 11. The wavelength shifting ﬁber and its connection to the crystal
were thoroughly implemented including the ﬁber material, ﬁber cladding and optical glue. The wavelength sifting
process was based on the absorbtion and emission spectra of BCF-19A ﬁbers provided by Bicron. For the simulation
no optimization of the material surfaces and the material boundary conditions were done.

PSN 0929

A light yield reduction to (9.3-9.8)% for the plastic scintillator and (8.3-12.0)% for the lead glass has been obtained

from the simulation, that is in a good agreement with the results of measurement.

wavelength shifting ﬁber.

5. CONCLUSION

The simulation studies of the BeamCal performance showed the considered technologies to be feasible. The
eﬃciency to detect electrons with energy of about 100 GeV and higher is almost 100% for most of the calorimeter
area.

The ongoing studies of diamond samples for the diamond-tungsten options are done in contact with the diamond
manufacturer (Fraunhofer Institute). The goal of the work is to prepare a calorimeter prototype with reliable diamond
sensors for further studies in a test-beam.

The ﬁber readout for the heavy crystal calorimeter is shown to be feasible. The GEANT4 simulation of the light
transportation is shown to be in a good agreement with the measurement results. That allows to include it to the
realistic simulation of the heavy crystal BeamCal.

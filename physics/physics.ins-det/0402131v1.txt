Abstract

We present the electron/pion identiﬁcation performance measured with prototypes for ALICE TRD. Measured
spectra of energy deposit of pions and electrons as well as their average values are presented and compared to
calculations. Various radiators are investigated over the momentum range of 1 to 6 GeV/c. The time signature of
TR is exploited in a bidimensional likelihood mothod.

Key words: transition radiation detector, electron/pion identiﬁcation, drift chambers
PACS: 29.40.Cs

1. Introduction

The ALICE Transition Radiation Detector
(TRD) [1] is designed for the study of quarkonia
and open charm mesons in heavy-ion collisions at
the CERN LHC. The TRD will provide electron
identiﬁcation and particle tracking, in particular
at the trigger level. A factor of 100 pion rejection
for 90% electron eﬃciency is the design goal of
the detector and was demonstrated with earlier
prototypes [2,1].

2. Experimental setup

The measurements are performed with four
identical prototype drift chambers (DC), with a
construction similar to that of the ﬁnal ALICE

TRD [1], but of a smaller active area (25×32 cm2).
The drift chambers have a drift region of 30 mm
and an ampliﬁcation region of 7 mm. The entrance
window (25 µm aluminized Kapton) simultane-
ously serves as gas barrier and as drift electrode.
For the ﬁnal detectors this window will be glued
on the radiator wall, but for the prototypes the
window is part of the drift chamber to allow tests
of various radiators. We operate the drift cham-
bers with the standard gas mixture for the TRD,
Xe,CO2(15%), at atmospheric pressure. The gas
is recirculated using a dedicated gas system. The
gas gain is about 4000.

Our radiators are sandwiches composed of
polypropylene (PP) ﬁbre mats (of 5 mm thick-
ness each) and two sheets of Rohacell foam of
thickness 6 mm (INV6, AIK6, which contain 8
ﬁbre mats) or 8 mm (INV8, which contains only
7 mats). A carbon ﬁbre reinforcement of about
100 µm thickness is applied on the external sides
of the Rohacell sheets. INV and AIK stand for two

diﬀerent manufacturers of this coating. The total
thickness of such a radiator is 4.8 cm. In addition,
for reference purposes, we tested pure PP ﬁbres
radiator of 4 cm thickness.

We use a prototype of the charge-sensitive
preampliﬁer/shaper (PASA) especially designed
and built for the TRD in 0.35 µm CMOS tech-
nology. It has a noise on detector of about 1000
electrons r.m.s. and the FWHM of the output
pulse is about 100 ns for an input step function.
The nominal gain of the PASA is 12 mV/fC, but
during the present measurements we use a gain of
6 mV/fC for a better match to the range of the
employed Flash ADC (FADC) system with 0.6 V
voltage swing. The FADC has adjustable base-
line, an 8-bit non-linear conversion and 20 MHz
sampling frequency. The FADC sampling was re-
binned in the oﬀ-line analysis to obtain 100 ns
time bins as for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD [1].

The measurements are carried out with four
identical
layers radiator/detector at beam mo-
menta of 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 GeV/c at the
T10 secondary beamline of the CERN PS. The
momentum resolution is ∆p/p ≃ 1%. The beam is
a mixture of electrons and negative pions. Similar
sample sizes of pion and electron events are ac-
quired within the same run via dedicated triggers.
We select clean samples of pions and electrons
using coincident thresholds on two Cherenkov de-
tectors and on a lead-glass calorimeter [2]. The
incident angle of the beam with respect to the
drift direction is 15◦ to avoid gas gain saturation
due to space charge [3].

3. General detector performance

In Fig. 1 we present the measured average signals
as a function of drift time for pions and electrons
(with and without radiator), for the momentum of
2 GeV/c. For our nominal drift ﬁeld of 0.7 kV/cm,
the detector signal is spread over about 2 µs (the
time zero is arbitrarily shifted). The peak at small
drift times originates form the ampliﬁcation re-
gion, while the plateau is from the drift region. For
the electrons, when using a radiator, the contribu-
tion of TR, which is preferentially absorbed at the
entrance of the detector, is evident.

(INV6 radiator) for the momentum of 2 GeV/c. The sym-
bols represent the measurements, the lines are calculations.

In Fig. 2 we present the measured distributions
of integrated energy deposit for pions and elec-
trons for the momentum of 2 GeV/c, for each of
the four layers. The data are compared to calcula-
tions, which include ionization energy loss [4] and,
in case of electrons, transition radiation (TR). For
TR production we employ a parametrization of a
regular radiator [5], which we tune to describe the
electron spectra. The calculations include TR ab-
sorption in the radiator reinforcement as well as

in the detector volume. As seen in Fig. 2, we can
achieve a good agreement with the measurements
with a reasonable (but not unique) set of param-
eters (”foil” thickness d1=10 µm, gap d2=80 µm,
number of ”foils” Nf =270). Pure TR measuremens
are described equally well [6].

to the results of calculations using as inputs the
measured single layer performance. As expected,
the agreement between the two cases is very good.
Consequently, for the following, the expected pion
eﬃciency for six layers (ﬁnal conﬁguration in AL-
ICE) is calculated from the single-layer variables
for which the measured signals of the four layers
are added to improve statistics.

However, with this recipe we cannot consistently
describe our measurements over all the momen-
tum range, as seen in Fig. 3, where we compare the
measured average integrated energy with simula-
tions. The experimental errors represent an esti-
mated 3% value. In addition, we estimate an overall
5% systematic uncertainty of the energy calibra-
tion. The agreement on dE/dx is very good, both
for pions and for electrons [4]. The momentum de-
pendence of the TR yield is not properly described.
TR is overestimated at low momenta and underes-
timated at high momenta. Other sets of d1/d2/Nf
values also fail to reproduce the data. An imple-
mentation of an irregular radiator is in progress.

tion of the number of layers considered in the like-
lihood. Measured data (open circles) are compared

In Fig. 5 we present the pion eﬃciency (the pion
rejection is the inverse of this value) as a function
of momentum for three sandwich radiators and for
pure PP ﬁbres of 4 cm thickness. The upper panel
shows the results for a likelihood method on inte-
grated charge (LQ). For this case the results with-
out radiator are included as well, showing a strong
degradation as a function of momentum due to the
pion relativistic rise. Transition radiation nicely
compensates this, leading to a pion rejection fac-
tor of around 100 at 90% electron eﬃciency, with a
weak dependence on momentum. The three coated
sandwich radiators show a similar performance,
while the pure ﬁbres radiator is better, although it
is thinner by 0.8 cm.

The lower panel of Fig. 5 is for a so-called bidi-
mensional likelihood [7], for which the distribution
of the time bin with the maximum measured am-
plitude is used together with the integrated charge
measurement (LQX ). An improvement of the pion

5. Summary

Fig. 5. Pion eﬃciency as a function of momentum for vari-
ous radiator types. Upper panel: likelihood on total charge;
for this case the performance in case of dE/dx only (no ra-
diators) is included. Lower panel: bidimensional likelihood
on charge and position (see text).

rejection by a factor of about 1.6 is achieved with
this method. This improvement is needed to pro-
vide a safety factor for the expected degradation of
the performance in the high-multiplicity heavy-ion
collisions at the LHC [1]. The pion rejection can
be further enhanced by exploiting the amplitude
measurement in each time bin, which is, however,
highly correlated and cannot be used in a straight-
forward way in a likelihood method. Developments
in this direction are under way.

The pion eﬃciencies presented above are mea-
sured averages over 4 layers. We have observed that
the pion rejection performance extracted from in-
dividual layers improves substantially from layer
1 to layer 4. This is also apparent in Fig 2 in the
charge spectra of electrons. As seen in Fig. 6, this
improvement is bigger for larger momenta. Propa-
gation and absorption of TR deeper into the stack

We have demonstrated in measurements with
prototypes that the requested pion rejection fac-
tor of 100 can be achieved for ALICE TRD. The
measurements of energy deposit of pions and elec-
trons were compared to calculations. Various ra-
diators have been investigated over the momen-
tum range 1-6 GeV/c. A bidimensional likelihood
method sizeably enhances the pion rejection and
is under current study for further improvements.

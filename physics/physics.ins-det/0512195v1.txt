The ﬁrst-level trigger of ATLAS

Johannes Haller∗

E-mail: haller@mail.cern.ch

Due to the huge interaction rates and the tough experimental environment of pp collisions at a
centre-of-mass energy √s = 14 TeV and luminosities of up to 1034cm−
1, one of the experi-
mental challenges at the LHC is the triggering of interesting events. In the ATLAS experiment

2s−

a three-level trigger system is foreseen for this purpose. The ﬁrst-level trigger is implemented in
custom hardware and has been designed to reduce the data rate from the initial bunch-crossing
rate of 40 MHz to around 75 kHz. Its event selection is based on information from the calorime-
ters and dedicated muon detectors. This article gives an overview over the full ﬁrst-level trigger
system including the Calorimeter Trigger, the Muon Trigger and the Central Trigger Processor.

In addition, recent results are reported that have been obtained from test-beam studies performed
at CERN where the full ﬁrst-level trigger chain was established successfully for the ﬁrst time and
used to trigger the read-out of up to nine ATLAS sub-detector systems.

The ﬁrst level trigger of ATLAS

Johannes Haller

1. Introduction

∼

2s−

The LHC will collide protons at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV with luminosities of up to
1. Bunches will cross with a rate of 40 MHz, corresponding to a time interval between
1034cm−
1 GHz is expected at nominal
bunch-crossings (BC) of 25 ns. A total interaction (IA) rate of
25 IAs per BC. In this challenging environment the ATLAS trigger system
luminosity leading to
must reduce the rate to below the maximum rate that can be processed by the ofﬂine computing
facilities, about 200 Hz, while selecting previously undetected and rare physics processes. For
example a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 120 GeV, decaying into two photons, is
expected to occur in one out of 1013 IAs. The ATLAS trigger is composed of three levels. Its
ﬁrst level (LVL1) [1] is implemented in electronics and ﬁrmware, whereas the higher levels [2]
are based on software algorithms running in processor farms. In the following a brief overview of
LVL1 is given and recent results from test-beam (TB) studies are reported.

∼

2. LVL1 system overview

The ﬁrst-trigger level is a hardware-based system that reduces the event rate to below 75 kHz
(upgradeable to 100 kHz) within a ﬁxed latency of below 2.5 m s. The LVL1 is composed of three
parts (see Fig. 1 (left)): the Calorimeter Trigger (L1Calo), the Muon Trigger (L1Muon), and the
LVL1 event-decision part implemented in the Central Trigger Processor (CTP).

The Calorimeter Trigger relies heavily on FPGAs installed in the ATLAS electronics cav-
ern. In ATLAS, calorimetry is provided by lead and copper liquid-argon sampling calorimeters
(LAr) and an iron scintillator-tile sampling calorimeter (TileCal) for hadronic calorimetry in the
barrel. On-detector electronics combines the analogue signals to
7200 projective trigger towers
(TT). The Preprocessor (PPr) electronics digitises the TT signals and performs BC identiﬁcation
and calibration. The Cluster Processor (CP) identiﬁes electron/g and t /hadron candidates using
sliding window algorithms. The ET of e/g (t /hadron) candidates is discriminated against up to 16
(8) programmable thresholds. The Jet/Energy Processor (JEP) identiﬁes jet candidates and dis-
criminates their ET values against eight programmable thresholds. The JEP also evaluates several
global energy sums. Synchronously with the 40 MHz machine clock L1Calo sends multiplicities of
e/g , t /hadron and jet candidates, as well as the global energy information to the CTP via Common
Merger Modules (CMM).

∼

The ATLAS muon spectrometer consists of three stations of monitored drift-tube chambers
(MDT) and dedicated fast muon detectors for triggering – resistive-plate chambers (RPC) in the
barrel and thin-gap chambers (TGC) in the forward region. The algorithms of the Muon Trig-
ger are based on hit coincidences in different stations within a geometrical road whose width is
related to the pT threshold applied exploiting the deﬂection of muons in the magnetic ﬁeld. The
coincidence logic allows six thresholds to be used at the same time. The Muon-to-CTP-Interface
(MuCTPI) forwards the multiplicities of muon candidates for each threshold to the CTP after re-
solving possible double counting of muons that traverse more than one detector region.

The Central Trigger Processor makes the LVL1 decision (LVL1 accept, L1A) based on the
information received from L1Muon, L1Calo and other sources (scintillator counters, random trig-
gers, etc.). The CTP can handle up to 160 input trigger signals at any time and combines them

logically to up to 256 triggers according to a trigger menu. It applies deadtime and prescale factors
for each trigger. The L1A signal, the logical OR of all triggers, is then distributed to the various
sub-detectors via Trigger Timing and Control (TTC) partitions including one Local Trigger Pro-
cessor (LTP) each. A busy tree allows the sub-detectors to throttle the generation of L1As. For
accepted events, all systems send data to the second-level trigger and to the read-out system via the
Region-of-interest-Builder (RoIB).

3. Results from studies at the ATLAS combined test-beam

During 2004 a full slice of the ATLAS detector including the trigger detectors (LAr, TileCal,
RPC, TGC) was installed at the H8 beam line of CERN’s SPS providing p, e, p , m and g beams
with energies ranging from 1 GeV up to 360 GeV. The TB activity focused on testing prototypes
and ﬁnal modules of all sub-detectors, including the full trigger and data-acquisition chain. A data
taking period with 25 ns time structured beam offered the possibility to test the LVL1 trigger chain
simulating LHC conditions with real detector signals [3].

LAr and TileCal provided inputs to a full slice of L1Calo electronics (1 % of the ﬁnal ca-
pacity), i.e. prototype modules with one PPr, one JEP, two CPs and teo CMMs. The modules
successfully passed internal consistency checks and good correlation was found between the LAr
and TileCal energy reconstruction and the energies as seen in the TT read-out from the trigger hard-
ware. Figure 1 (right) shows the correlation of electromagnetic energy as measured by the LAr and
the trigger electronics for a run with a trigger threshold of 20 GeV. The clear cut-off demonstrates
that triggers were generated on genuine physics events. For the ﬁrst time L1Calo was successfully
integrated with the central trigger and provided trigger information to the CTP.

Similarly, the L1Muon electronics was successfully integrated with the RPC and TGC detec-
tors which delivered promising data. As an example Fig. 2 (left) shows the correlation between
RPC and MDT position measurements. The efﬁciency to identify the correct BC by the endcap
system is shown in Fig. 2 (right). It demonstrates the big timing margin in the TGC electronics
where the efﬁciency to trigger on the correct bunch is large while the efﬁciency for the bunch be-
fore and after is tiny. Also the coincidence algorithm was successfully tested by emulation of the
deﬂection in the magnetic ﬁeld (missing at the TB) by shifting one of the trigger-chamber stations.

trigger efﬁciencies as function of a delay parameter in the TGC electronics.

The L1Muon electronics of both barrel and endcap was successfully integrated with the full LVL1
system and provided data to the MuCTPI that sent the multiplicities to the CTP.

In total the ﬁnal modules of the CTP included 46 input trigger bits (including 3 external bits
from scintillator triggers of the beam instrumentation) in the calculation of the LVL1 decision. Us-
ing an LTP, the L1A signal was then fanned out to the sub-detector front-end electronics triggering
their read-out. A projection of the measured LVL1 latency at the TB to the ﬁnal ATLAS LVL1
latency including cable length and time-of-ﬂight corrections gave a value of 2.13 m s, which is well
within the budget of 2.5 m s. Also the busy tree was successfully established. The full LVL1 trigger
system was run routinely under the main ATLAS Run Control system.

In this article a brief overview of the ATLAS LVL1 trigger has been given and promising
results from recent TB studies have been reported. For the ﬁrst time the full LVL1 trigger chain
was established and integrated with the corresponding trigger detectors and the main ATLAS Run
Control system. The L1A signal was used to trigger the read-out of up to nine sub-detectors.

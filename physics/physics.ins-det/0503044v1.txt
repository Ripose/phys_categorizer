Abstract

In low background and low threshold particle astrophysics experiments using
observation of Cherenkov or scintillation light it is common to use pairs or arrays
of photomultipliers operated in coincidence. In such circumstances, for instance
in dark matter and neutrino experiments, unexpected PMT noise events have
been observed, probably arising from generation of light from one PMT being
detected by one or more other PMTs. We describe here experimental investiga-
tion of such coincident noise events and development of new techniques to remove
them using novel pulse shape discrimination procedures. When applied to data
from a low background NaI detector with facing PMTs the new procedures are
found to improve noise rejection by a factor of 20 over conventional techniques,
with signiﬁcantly reduced loss of signal events.

1 Introduction

Photomultiplier noise can signiﬁcantly limit the sensitivity of low background and low
threshold astroparticle physics experiments searching for rare events such as neutrinos
or WIMP dark matter using Cherenkov or scintillator technology. The drive for low
threshold, which determines, for instance, the minimum energy of neutrino that can
be detected in an astrophysical neutrino detector, requires detection of the lowest
possible number of photons in the target medium. This translates to design geometries
that use many photomultipliers to view the medium, operated in coincidence. Such
designs provide the necessary good light collection but furthermore, because of the
coincidence operation, provide an eﬀective means of suppressing certain types of well
known PMT (Photomultiplier Tubes) noise, in particular single-photoelectron (SPE)
noise and after-pulses. For these types of noise there is no causal relation between noise
generated in a given tube and that in any other tube.

However, operation of these designs in which PMTs are eﬀectively light coupled
together, makes them vulnerable to other forms of PMT noise, in particular to eﬀects
often ascribed to “dynode glow” [1, 2]. This is believed to be due to light emitted
from the dynode stack under electron bombardment being scattered and reﬂected back
to the photocathode. This can produce noise in the host tube but additionally the
photons produced can in principle also be observed by all light-coupled tubes. Such
a coincident event is not suppressed by the coincidence operation and may mimic a
signal event. Signiﬁcant phenomena of this sort have been observed in the SNO detec-
tor, where they have been termed “ﬂashers”. These are seen at ∼1000/day above an
18 hit threshold comprising relatively prompt ﬂashes of light attributed to discharges
In dark matter detectors based on NaI, liquid Xe and other
from the dynodes [3].
scintillators where high sensitivity and low background is needed, a likely related class
of events sometimes termed “step” events is seen [4, 5]. The drive for lower thresholds
and lower backgrounds means that such unusual and rare events will become an in-
creasingly signiﬁcant source of systematic error in these and other planned PMT-based
low background detectors.

In this paper we describe investigation of such coincident PMT noise events and
the development of new techniques to identify and suppress these events. The work
was undertaken using apparatus at the Boulby Underground Laboratory comprising
a low background shielding castle within which can be mounted pairs of face-to-face
low background photomultipliers with and without scintillator in various conﬁgurations
(see sec 2). The apparatus used is based on that of the modules of the NAIAD (Sodium
Iodide (NaI) Advanced Detector) experiment [6]. The NAIAD experiment is a direct
search for WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) dark matter, comprising an
array of 8 shielded low background NaI(Tl) crystals viewed by pairs of photomultipliers
[7]. WIMP search experiments use various techniques to distinguish between nuclear
recoil events, expected from WIMP interactions, and background electron recoil events.
In the case of NaI(Tl) crystals, such as used in NAIAD, and several other experiments,
this discrimination is achieved using pulse shape analysis to identify nuclear recoils
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. This is possible because in NaI(Tl), for instance, the scintillator
time constant for nuclear recoil events is shorter (typically 170-200 ns) than for electron
recoils (typically 240-300 ns).

Dark matter limits are set using this technique by determining statistically the

2

maximum number of recoil events that may be present in a dataset. However, as with
many such low background experiments it is crucial to have sensitivity at the lowest
possible energy, to probe the maximum range of initial particle energy or mass. For
this reason the coincidence threshold is usually set low, for instance at approximately 1
keV in NAIAD, allowing a sensitivity to WIMP masses in principle below 100 GeV. In
such experiments the rate of PMT noise events is greatly reduced by using coincidence
counting which demands that each PMT should see a minimum signal for an event to
be accepted. However, any coincident PMT noise remains and strategies to reduce this
(rather than just the SPE or non-causal noise) then become of major importance.

In low background experiments using optically coupled PMTs such as this, some
suppression of coincident noise can be achieved by the following two techniques: (a)
additional pulse shape analysis of the events, and (b) asymmetry cuts. The former
technique is based on the observation that the distribution of time constants of low
energy PMT coincident noise events can be ﬁtted to an exponential function. This has
a faster characteristic mean decay time than that of most scintillator events (though
slower than the normal PMT response time). This distribution can be ﬁtted and then
subtracted from the data, even though the distribution overlaps with the distribution
of time constants for scintillation events. Figure 1 shows a typical low energy time con-
stant distribution for NaI including this noise feature. The asymmetry cut technique is
based mainly on comparing the characteristics of coincident events, such as amplitude,
absolute start time of the pulse and pulse shape [6, 7, 12]. The assumption used is
that coincident noise seen in the tubes is due to light emitted from one tube being seen
by one or more other tubes, as suggested occurs in SNO and dark matter experiments
[3, 5]. In this case, unlike the situation for genuine signal events, the characteristics
are likely to be asymmetric, for instance the pulse in one PMT being of much larger
amplitude than the other, or with faster rise time.

Although these techniques are useful they both have clear drawbacks. The coinci-
dent noise subtraction technique, although powerful, assumes that the exponential ﬁt
of short time constant events may be extrapolated to higher time constants, through
the data events. This assumption introdues systematic errors into the results. Such a
subtraction also necessarily entails the possible rejection of genuine events, requiring
the introduction of an eﬃciency factor. The asymmetry cuts can not remove coincident
noise events which give pulses in the tubes of similar characteristic. The asymmetry
technique also requires operation in coincident mode, which may not always be possible
or desirable. For dark matter searches any PMT noise events misidentiﬁed as nuclear
recoil events reduce the eﬀectiveness of pulse shape discrimination analysis.

Based on the drawbacks above there is a need to develop new techniques to re-
ject coincident noise events with ﬁt time constants comparable to signal events. We
describe here new work in this area. Firstly, the apparatus used to acquire and char-
acterise samples of low background coincident PMT noise data is outlined. This is
followed by details of how the data were analysed and compared with data taken with
similar conﬁgurations but with scintillator present. We then discuss the development
of analysis techniques designed speciﬁcally to identify and reject coincident PMT noise.
Finally, we will show comparisons between the eﬀectiveness of the new procedures and
more traditional techniques.

2 Experimental setup and data

All PMT noise measurements were performed at the Boulby Underground Laboratory
at 1070 m depth, using the apparatus shown in Figure 2. The set up comprises a
shielding castle, incorporating 15 cm of low background lead, inside of which is a
further 10 cm layer of copper shielding. The castle was supplied with an automatic
source dropper to allow remote calibration of the scintillator using γ-ray sources (57Co
and 60Co). A copper support structure allows 5 inch PMTs to be mounted face to
face in a variety of conﬁgurations within the castle. EMI 9390 5 inch PMTs were used
throughout. Four arrangements were used in the present work:

(i) PMTs optically coupled to each other through two 14 cm diameter cylindrical

quartz light guides each 5 cm thick.

(ii) PMTs optically coupled directly with no intervening light guide.
(iii) PMTs coupled together but with the quartz lightguides separated and coupled

through a 5 cm long NaI(Tl) crystal of 14 cm diameter.

(iv) PMTs coupled directly face to face but with an opaque barrier to stop direct

light transmission between the tubes.

Data were collected using an in-house LabView based data aquisition system [5], the
signals from each PMT being ﬁrst passed through an integrating buﬀer. The integrated
signals were fed to discriminator units set to trigger when signals exceed a threshold
of 10 mV, equivalent to 4 photoelectrons. The logic signals from the discriminator
units were fed to a coincidence unit which triggers a digital oscilloscope when signals
arrive from both discriminators. When the oscilloscope was triggered, the integrated
signals from both PMTs were digitised and stored, each digitisation point representing
10 ns elapsed time. These signals were then read through a GPIB (General Purpose
Interface Bus) system into a computer which wrote the digitised pulses to a data ﬁle
for later analysis.

Figure 3 shows an example gamma pulse from the system when conﬁgured with
set-up (iii) with the light guides and NaI(Tl) crystal in place. Two integrated pulses,
one from each tube, are seen, plus the summed pulse. In such integrated pulses single
photoelectrons are observed as small steps in the pulse. A conventional pulse shape
analysis, such as used in dark matter searches, is performed by ﬁtting the summed
integrated signal to an exponential function:

f (A, t, t0, τ ) = A(1 − e

(t

−t)
0
τ

),

(1)

where A is the amplitude of the integrated pulse, which is proportional to the
number of photoelectrons, t0 is the start time of the rise of the integrated pulse, and τ
is the exponential ﬁt time constant. Further details of this analysis are given in [6, 7].
A pulse such as shown in Figure 3 is most likely due to scintillation. Tests with the
apparatus conﬁgured in an identical manner but without the crystal in place (set-up
(i)) reveal, as shown by the example pulse in Figure 4, that coincident PMT noise pulses
may lead to pulse shapes with similar characteristics. Tests without the light guides in
place (set-up (ii)) demonstrated that similar events are still present and so conﬁrmed
that the quartz itself is not responsible for the events. Events of this kind would not
be cut by conventional asymmetry cuts as the amplitudes and shapes in both tubes

4

are similar. Identical runs but with an opaque card in place to block direct passage of
light between the tubes (set-up (iv)) conﬁrmed that in this case no coincident events
are observed. All these results together conﬁrm the suspicion that slow (>100 ns)
coincident noise events exist and that they are due to light generated in one tube being
recorded by both tubes.

In accordance with NaI analysis procedures developed by the UKDM Collaboration
[6, 7, 12], data recorded from the experiments here were binned in 2-d histograms of
pulse height (energy) and ﬁt time constant. Figure 5 (upper points) shows a typical
extracted 1-d time constant distribution for the coincident noise events taken without
scintillator for a pulse amplitude band equivalent to 4-6 keV (set-up (i)) with no cuts.
With the scintillator in place calibration with 57Co (122 keV gamma line) is used to
determine the energy scale. Comparison with the results with no scintillator then allows
an eﬀective energy scale to be determined when no scintillator is present. For the tests
with scintillator a 60Co source was used to generate low energy compton electron recoils
via compton scattering in the crystal with a broad spectrum of energies. Since the rate
of scintillation events in such calibration runs is much higher than that of any noise
events the data may be used as a pure sample of scintillation events. By comparing
noise events from data collected with no scintillator and scintillation events from data
collected with no noise, with similar amplitude and time constant, it is possible to
identify features which are much more common in the noise events than in scintillator
events and thereby to identify noise events in real data. The rate fall oﬀ with increasing
time constant seen in Figure 5 (upper plot), has the characteristic exponential form
that is used as a basis for the conventinal noise subtraction technique [12]. This form
is seen clearly in the NaI data of Figure 1 at low time constant.

3 Investigation and improved reduction of noise

Typical asymmetry cuts used to reject noise from NAIAD data, reject events where
the ﬁt time constants of pulses from each PMT diﬀer by 100 ns or more, or where
the start times of the pulses diﬀer by 100 ns or more, or where the energy associated
with the pulses diﬀers by 40% of the combined energy or more [5, 12]. Cuts based
on these parameters represent the current best procedures but, as discussed above,
do not adeqately deal with the coincident noise phenomena. To improve the situation
and develop better rejection strategies the characteristics of noise pulses were examined
more closely. This study revealed, in particular, that a large population of the observed
smaller multi-photoelectron noise events when ﬁtted to exponentials had very short
time constants (<100 ns). Based on this, the assumption was made that the noise
events observed with longer time constants are combinations of such “step” events
each separated by a few tens of ns. These steps may have some causal relationship
but are not the result of a true exponential decay as is the case for true scintillation
pulses. Working from this assumption, various quantities relating to the quality of
ﬁts to exponentials were investigated, to determine which could be used to distinguish
the multi-step noise events from scintillation events with a similar decay proﬁle. Cuts
deﬁned based on these quantities have been termed “quality cuts”.

5

The most obvious quality cut arises from measuring the χ2 per degree of freedom:

χ2 =

n1

Xi=n0

(f (A, ti, t0, τ ) − Di)2
σ2
i

,

(2)

where n0 is the ﬁrst data point included, n1 is the last data point included, f (ti, t0, τ )
is the ﬁt as described in Equation 1, ti is the time at digitisation point i, Di is the
measured amplitude at that digitisation point and σi is the uncertainty on that ampli-
tude.

Unfortunately, although a least squares method is used to ﬁt the pulses to an
exponential, calculating the χ2 is not straightforward because the ﬁt is performed on
integrated pulses and the uncertainties on each digitised pulse point are not deﬁned.
To deal with this problem, a value for uncertainty is chosen for each pulse and applied
to all digitised points within that pulse. This uncertainty is chosen to be proportional
to the square root of the total number of photoelectrons the pulse represents and is
normalised to yield an average χ2 per degree of freedom of 1.0 for scintillation events
of all energies.

The rise of an integrated pulse represents the arrival of photons at the PMT, but
the ﬂat part of the pulse following the rise does not. Since no new information is
associated with this part of the digitised pulse, tests were made with evaluation of
the ﬁt quality within limited time regions of the pulse. The typical scintillation time
constant is 250-300 ns and it was found that calculation of χ2 per degree of freedom
using the ﬁrst 50 ns, 50 to 100 ns or 100 to 500 ns of pulse data points give quantities
which are useful in identifying noise events. The χ2 calculated using the full pulse was
also found to be useful. Usually one or more of these particular quality parameters is
typically larger for a given noise event than for similar scintillation events. However,
no one parameter set appears suﬃcient alone to identify all noise events. Noise may
be identiﬁed by some of the parameters but missed by others.

To address this, a further new quality cut technique was devised which we have
called “steppiness”. Steppiness (Γ) provides a means to quantify the tendency of the
digitised PMT coinicident noise pulse to be made up of multi-photoelectron steps. It
is described by the following equations:

N −n
i=1

µi
f ′(A,ti,t0,τ )

Γ = P

N − n

(3)

where µi =

νi − νi−1 : νi − νi−1 ≥ νcrit
0 : νi − νi−1 < νcrit

(cid:26)

and νi =

i+n−1
j=i Dj
n

.

P
Calculation of steppiness for a particular pulse proceeds as follows: each digitised
point (Dj) is converted to an average over n points starting from Di and ending at
Di+n−1. N digitisation points are used from the start of the pulse (t0) to the end
It was found that n = 3 (corresponding to a 30 ns time
of the digitisation range.
window) gives optimum results. This value is labelled ν. µ is the change in ν from
one digitisation point to the next. If the change in ν is less than that for the arrival of

6

2 photoelectrons (νcrit), calculated based on a single photoelectron calibration of the
PMT, then µ is set to zero. This was done because steps of one photoelectron are to
be expected throughout the pulse and such a step is not an indication of pulse quality.
The sum µ at each digitisation point divided by the gradient of the ﬁt at the same
point is calculated and converted to an average to acquire the value of steppiness. The
gradient is used as a measure of how reasonable it is to have a step of certain size at
each point and serves to weight the values.

The steppiness quantity and the full χ2 quantity were found to best identify noise
events which have been ﬁtted with a long time constant (>300 ns) whereas the partial
χ2 quantities were found to work best on faster events (<300 ns). Together, it has
been found that these quantities may be used to eﬃciently identify the full range of
noise events with time constants in the scintillation region. This is illustrated in Figure
5. Here the eﬀect of the quality cuts on a sample of pure PMT coincident noise data
is shown for events taken without scintillator, and for pulse heights equivalent to 4-6
keV. It can be seen that the noise suppression factor is >1000 above 70 ns and still
a factor 100 at lower time constants. Figure 6 shows the eﬀect of quality cuts on
real experimental data (lower points) compared with the eﬀect of using conventional
asymmetry cuts (upper points). An excellent reduction in noise can be seen in the
critical scintillation-like region of 30-200 ns. The improvement at 100 ns being about
a factor of 20. For NaI dark matter searches the key region of interest in a plot such
as this is the left side of the main peak at 100-200 ns, the region expected for nuclear
recoil events. The remarkable noise reduction and clariﬁcation of the electron signal
here can be expected to improve sensitivity and control of systematic errors that result
from usual noise subtraction techniques.

In addition, calculations were made of χ2 over what is expected to be the ﬂat
region of the pulse at (t − t0) >500 ns (see Figure 3). This quantity was found to be
very eﬀective for identifying events containing either PMT after-pulse signals or noise
events within scintillation events. These events are rejected from NAIAD because the
presence of the after-pulse may aﬀect the accuracy of the least squares ﬁtting routine.
Any loss of genuine scintillation or Cherenkov events from experimental data due to
application of noise cuts clearly reduces experiment sensitivity. In the case of scintilla-
tors such as NaI using pulse shape analysis the important parameters are the proportion
of electron recoils lost due to cuts and, for dark matter, the propotion of nuclear recoil
events lost. Various test runs were performed to examine these eﬃciency losses using
gamma and neutron sources. In the current apparatus, due to the saturation of the
DAq at high rates, the 60Co calibration data has a much lower PMT noise content than
normal low background data. The scintillation event rate for such data is much higher
(typically 50 s−1 within the energy range 4-15 keV compared to less than 1 s−1 for data
collected with no source) but the PMT noise rate remains constant. The fraction of
events cut from such data therefore gives a good indication of the eﬃciency of the cuts.
Table 1 shows the eﬃciency of the newly developed cuts calculated in this manner
compared to the eﬃciency of the traditional asymmetry cuts calculated by applying
the cuts to 60Co calibration data collected in the Boulby mine underground laboratory
at a controlled crystal temperature of 8◦C. The quality cuts have been optimised to
remove all noise with time constants in and around the scintillation region. Comparing,
for instance, the energy band at 6-8 keV (critical in dark matter searches) the loss of
valid events due to asymmetry cuts is no greater than 16%. The quality cut process

7

yields a slightly smaller loss, lower by typically 4%.

For NaI dark matter experiments the goal is to search for nuclear recoil events in
experimental data, so eﬃciency in terms of fraction of rejected nuclear recoil events is
also important. Neutron source calibration data collected on the surface has a very
low noise content in much the same way as 60Co calibration data. Such data were used
to measure the eﬃciency of the cuts. Table 2 compares cut eﬃciencies calculated by
applying the cuts to 60Co calibration data collected on the surface at room temperature.
Table 3 compares cut eﬃciency calculated by applying the cuts to neutron calibration
data collected on the surface at room temperature. These two tables show that the
eﬃciencies for electron recoil events are similar to those for nuclear recoil events. Again
the quality cuts cause slightly less loss of events, by typically 4-7%.

4 Conclusions

An experiment to acquire a sample of pure PMT coincident noise data was performed
using a low background shielding array underground at the Boulby facility. These data
were analysed and parameters developed to distinguish and thereby cut this noise from
real data. The newly developed cuts have been shown to be more eﬀective at remov-
ing noise from experimental data and more eﬃcient in preserving scintillation events
compared to the asymmetry cuts currently used. In the typical scintillator region of
around 100 ns the noise rejection is improved by a factor of 20. These cuts have further
been shown to preserve nuclear recoil scintillation events with the same eﬃciency as
electron recoil scintillation events and in both cases with slightly better eﬃciency than
possible with assymetry cuts (by about 4-7%). Similar quality cuts may prove eﬀective
in a range of experiments using PMTs required to work near threshold. Furthermore,
since the new technique no longer relies on measuring coincidence asymmetry, it can
in principle be applied to single PMT set-ups. The cuts developed here will be used
in analysing data from NAIAD and are expected to produce a signiﬁcant improvement
in the sensitivity of the experiment and control of systematic error that previously
resulted from noise subtraction.

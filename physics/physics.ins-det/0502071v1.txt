Abstract

Scintillation light produced in liquid xenon (LXe) by alpha particles, electrons and
gamma-rays was detected with a large area avalanche photodiode (LAAPD) im-
mersed in the liquid. The alpha scintillation yield was measured as a function of
applied electric ﬁeld. We estimate the quantum eﬃciency of the LAAPD to be
45%. The best energy resolution from the light measurement at zero electric ﬁeld
is 7.5%(σ) for 976 keV internal conversion electrons from 207Bi and 2.6%(σ) for
5.5 MeV alpha particles from 241Am. The detector used for these measurements
was also operated as a gridded ionization chamber to measure the charge yield. We
conﬁrm that using a LAAPD in LXe does not introduce impurities which inhibit
the drifting of free electrons.

liquid xenon (LXe) [4]. LXe scintillation light is in the VUV region, centered at
178 nm [5], which makes it diﬃcult to detect eﬃciently. Within the context of
the R&D for the XENON dark matter project [6], we are testing diﬀerent pho-
todetectors directly coupled to LXe, including UV sensitive photomultipliers
(Hamamatsu R9288 and R8520), microchannel plate PMTs (Burle 85006),
silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) [7] and LAAPDs from Advanced Photonix,
Inc.(API). In this paper we report our ﬁrst results on the detection of LXe
scintillation with a 16 mm diameter LAAPD, mounted on a custom designed
ceramic support [8]. The interest in LAAPDs for LXe is in their high quan-
tum eﬃciency (QE) at 178 nm, as originally reported by [4]. Their negligible
radioactive contamination is also attractive for low background experiments
based on LXe, such as direct dark matter searches (XENON [6] and ZEPLIN
[9]) and neutrinoless double beta decay searches (EXO [10]).

On the other hand, for a practical application of LAAPDs, especially for LXe
based dark matter searches, several issues remain to be addressed. The primary
concern is the capability of a light readout based on LAAPDs to achieve the
low energy threshold of a few tens of keV required for high sensitivity. Other
issues include long term stability of operation, impact on LXe purity, as well as
readout complexity and cost. The experiments presented in this paper aimed
at conﬁrming the high QE for LXe scintillation reported in the literature, and
at verifying the compatibility of LAAPDs immersed in the liquid with the
requirement to detect tiny ionization signals, at the single electron level.

2 Experimental set-up

The 16 mm diameter, windowless LAAPD tested in these experiments was
mounted inside a gridded ionization chamber, ﬁlled with high purity LXe.
A photograph of the assembled electrodes and LAAPD is shown in Fig. 1.
The cathode is a 6 cm diameter stainless steel plate with either a gamma
ray source (207Bi) or an alpha source (241Am) deposited on its center. The
shielding grid and the anode grid are made with stretched wires on stainless
steel frames, with a thickness of about 0.8 mm. The wire spacing is 2 mm,
and the wire diameter is 60 µm. The separation between cathode and grid
is 1 cm, which deﬁnes the maximum drift gap for ionization electrons. The
grid to anode separation is 3 mm. The electrodes spacing was maintained
with rings made of PTFE, for its high reﬂectivity in the UV region [11]. The
LAAPD, originally glued by API on a thin ceramic substrate, was mounted
on a PTFE disk, facing the anode grid at a distance of 6 mm above. We note
that the LAAPD had been exposed to air for several months prior to its use
in LXe. Hermetic feedthroughs are used for cathode and grid HV lines and for
anode signal readout via a charge sensitive ampliﬁer. Additional feedthroughs
are used to bias the LAAPD and to connect its output to a separate charge

2

sensitive ampliﬁer.

A schematic drawing of the detector system and electronics readout is shown
in Fig. 2. The ionization electrons, which are created from gamma rays or
alpha particles in the drift region, are drifted upward by the applied electric
ﬁeld, and are collected by a charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁer (ClearPulse Model
580 [12]) connected to the anode. The scintillation light hits the LAAPD and
produces photoelectrons, which are ampliﬁed by the avalanche process. The
avalanche electrons are collected by an AmpTek 250 pre-ampliﬁer [13]. The
charge and light signals, either from ClearPulse 580 or AmpTek A250, are fed
into a low-noise shaping ampliﬁer (ORTEC 450 [14]). The ampliﬁed signals are
further fed into a PC-based multi-channel analyser (MCA) for spectroscopy
analysis. Known test pulses are used to calibrate the DAQ system, for both
light and charge signals. The capacitances in the pre-ampliﬁers were calibrated
with a silicon detector. We used an open bath cooling apparatus with a liquid
nitrogen and alcohol mixture to condense the xenon gas. The vessel enclosing
the assembled detector was ﬁlled with high purity LXe, covering completely
the LAAPD. As shown in Fig. 2, we used a high temperature getter to pu-
rify Xe gas continuously via a diaphragm pump. The system, developed for
XENON prototypes, is described in [15].

3 Experimental measurements

3.1 LAAPD gain

The gain of the LAAPD was measured in a diﬀerent set-up conﬁguration,
which optimizes the light collection eﬃciency by placing the LAAPD very close
(about 3.5 mm) to the source plate, at -95oC (Fig. 3). The direct scintillation
from a 5.5 MeV alpha source (241Am) was measured as a function of applied
voltage on the LAAPD up to about 1500 V. Unitary gain was determined from
the average amplitude in the 300 to 500 V range [16]. The typical reduction
in applied voltage, for a constant gain, when reducing temperature [17] was
observed, corresponding to an average voltage variation of about 2.4 V/oC at
a gain of 100.

3.2 Scintillation spectroscopy

The scintillation light spectrum of the 207Bi radiation in LXe was measured,
as shown in Fig. 4. Due to the small liquid xenon sensitive volume, the energy
from most of the 1064 keV gamma rays of 207Bi is not fully deposited. The

3

second peak on the spectrum is mostly contributed by the 976 keV internal
conversion electrons. As the gamma rays interact at any point in the liquid
xenon active volume, light collection in the LAAPD varies accordingly to the
interaction position. Using PTFE reﬂectors, the variation in light collection
can be reduced to less than 1%, without compromising the energy resolution.
The energy resolution for the 976 keV electrons of 207Bi is 7.5% (σ), which is
comparable to the energy resolution obtained earlier by using a PMT in the
same chamber with similar geometry [27]. The spectrum was accumulated at
zero electric ﬁeld to maximize light output from LXe.

To better evaluate the LAAPD performance in liquid xenon, larger amounts
of scintillation light are necessary. The 5.5 MeV alpha particles from 241Am
provide typically one order of magnitude larger scintillation pulse and their in-
teraction is very localized in liquid xenon, contributing to a clear scintillation
light spectrum. To get the best possible energy resolution, the gain of LAAPD
and shaping time on the ampliﬁer were optimized and ﬁnally a gain of 57 was
selected for this measurement as shown in Fig. 5. A very good energy resolu-
tion of 2.6% (σ) (with PTFE walls) and 3.0% (σ) (without PTFE walls) was
obtained. To compare the performance of LAAPD with other photon detec-
tion devices, the alpha spectrum was also measured using a 2-inch diameter
Hamamatsu R9288 PMT with less than 20% QE at 178 nm wavelength. A
value of 2.5% energy resolution was obtained.

The energy resolution as a function of LAAPD gain can be written as follows,

σ/E =

Ne
N0M

(
s

2

)

+

F

1

−
N0

+ δ2

(1)

The ﬁrst term in this equation is contributed from electronic noise. Ne is the
noise equivalent charge, which can be measured from the distribution of a
known test pulse. N0 is the number of primary electron-hole pair produced
from the scintillation light in the photodiode surface. M is the LAAPD gain.
The second term is from the ﬂuctuations of the gain and is inherent to the elec-
tron avalanche process of the LAAPD, where F is the excess noise factor. The
experimental value for F is approximately written as F = 1.7003 + 0.0021M
[19] for M > 30. The third term δ is contributed from the scintillation process
in the liquid xenon, including statistical ﬂuctuations of scintillation photon
production, and photoelectrons created in the LAAPD. Using the gain mea-
surement with the LAAPD at 3.5 mm from the source plate, we ﬁt the results
with the above equation with Ne and δ as free parameters (Fig. 6), while ﬁx-
ing F from the experimental value [19]. The noise equivalent charge Ne from
the ﬁt agrees well with the measured value with a calibrated test pulse. From
the ﬁtted values, we infer that the statistical ﬂuctuations contribute 1.8% to
the energy resolution, with a contribution of about 1.6% (1/√N0, N0
4000)
from ﬂuctuations in the number of photoelectrons.

4 Quantum eﬃciency

The quantum eﬃciency (η) of a LAAPD can be calculated by the following
equation,

η =

=

N0
Np

Nd/M
αNtot

(2)

Here N0 is the number of photoelectrons from the LAAPD, Np is the number of
photons reaching the LAAPD surface, M is the LAAPD gain, Nd is the number
of electron charges detected by the pre-ampliﬁer and Ntot is the total number
of scintillation photons produced by an event. Ntot is approximately equal to
E/Wph, where E is the energy of the event, and Wph is the average energy
required to produce a scintillation photon in liquid xenon. The Wph values are
21.6 eV [20] and 19.6 eV [21] for gamma and alpha events respectively. α is
the light collection eﬃciency, which is deﬁned as the percentage of the total
LXe light yield reaching the LAAPD surface. We have estimated the light
collection eﬃciency by using a light tracing simulation program in GEANT4
[22] with the assumptions listed in Table 1.

±

0.7% for
The estimated light collection eﬃciency from the simulation is 7.0
the structure with 1 cm thick PTFE wall between the cathode and grid. The
error indicates the diﬀerent reﬂectivity values used in the simulations. In the
case of no PTFE walls, the light collection eﬃciency was calculated by simply
using the solid angle for alpha particles and ignoring the reﬂectivity of stainless
steel. As result, 3.3% light collection eﬃciency was obtained. Considering a
20% stainless steel reﬂectivity, 4.1% light collection eﬃciency was obtained.
In order to estimate the number of photons incident on the LAAPD surface,
an average value for light collection eﬃciency was used, as presented in Table
2.

From the above considerations, we estimated the QE of the LAAPD for diﬀer-
ent measurements, which are shown in Table 2. The main uncertainty is from
the estimation of the light collection eﬃciency. The diﬀerent values obtained
from electron and alpha events may be due to the uncertainty in Wph and the
LAAPD gain values. In conclusion, we use the average of the QE values from
the electron and alpha measurements, which is 45

5%.

5 Field dependence of light yield

The liquid xenon scintillation light yield depends on the strength of the applied
electric ﬁeld [20]. The dependence of the scintillation yield of liquid xenon for

5

alpha particles has been measured by the Columbia group several years ago,
using an external PMT coupled to a LXe volume via a CaF2 window [25]. In the
current setup, we were able to measure this ﬁeld dependence with a LAAPD.
For comparison, we also measured this ﬁeld dependence with a Hamamatsu
R9288 PMT immersed in liquid xenon, in the same chamber. Fig. 7 shows the
combined results.

The LAAPD gain varies considerably with temperature, and our simple alcohol-
LN2 cooling bath does not keep the liquid temperature stable enough to avoid
temperature dependent gain variations. The gain of the PMT is not much
aﬀected by such small temperature ﬂuctuations. The data from the LAAPD
and the PMT are in good agreement, but the result with the LAAPD has
more ﬂuctuations due to its acute temperature dependence, which is obvious
from the curve.

6 Impact of LAAPD on LXe purity

One challenge involving photon detection devices immersed in liquid xenon
is their compatibility with the high purity required for electron drift, if a
combined charge and light readout is implemented. Our experience with LXe
detectors shows that the light yield of LXe is not very sensitive to the purity
level, unlike the charge yield. Many eﬀorts have been made in the past to detect
both ionization and scintillation, using PMTs, in liquid xenon [26]. Currently
we have developed a xenon recirculation and puriﬁcation system [15], which
continuously removes impurities from the liquid xenon during experiment.
Depending on the size of the detector, we can achieve a suﬃcient purity level
for drifting ionization electrons within two to tens of hours. During the ﬁrst
experiment with the LAAPD immersed in the LXe, we used this recirculation
system to purify the xenon, continuously. We measured the 976 keV peak
position of the 207Bi to monitor the charge collection. Within a few hours of
recirculation and puriﬁcation, we achieved a high charge collection of 75%.
The ionization spectrum of 207Bi at 1 kV/cm drift ﬁeld shown in Fig. 8 is
comparable to that measured in a liquid xenon ionization chamber with an
external PMT [28]. From the second experiment, we observed the same level of
charge collection even without using the recirculation system, which indicates
that the LAAPD is clean and does not bring any impurities into the liquid
xenon.

7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have demonstrated the operation of a LAAPD in liquid
xenon to detect scintillation light from gamma rays and alpha particles. We
have achieved the best energy resolution, for alpha particles and fast electrons,
from liquid xenon scintillation light detected by a LAAPD. The inferred value
of the QE is 45%, which is lower than that previously reported in [4]. A recent
article also reports a higher QE value from a measurement in gas xenon [29].
We have repeated the measurements with the LAAPD sample and conﬁrm
that the results are reproducible. A possible explanation for the lower QE is
the intrinsic quality of the LAAPD. This explanation appears consistent with
the subsequent QE measurement of the same LAAPD at room temperature,
using an indepedent setup. The QE was inferred from the ratio of the current
output from the LAAPD and a calibrated PIN diode, by irradiating UV light
from a xenon lamp to the devices [30]. The measured value (39
3%) is very
close to what we measured in liquid xenon. We believe that the QE of this
device should not change signiﬁcantly with temperature. We intend to test
a new LAAPD of the same type as used in [29] to investigate if the QE we
measured was speciﬁc to the sensor used.

±

The gain of the LAAPD is much lower than that of PMTs. Using an external
ampliﬁcation system limits the energy detection threshold, which is very cru-
cial for a sensitive dark matter detector. The scintillation light from a WIMP
recoil of a few tens of keV energy may produce not enough light to be detected
by the LAAPD. On the other hand, properties of LAAPDs, such as their com-
pact size, very high QE, and compatibility with low radioactive background
and high LXe purity requirements, make them attractive for applications of
LXe detectors in particle physics, medical imaging and astrophysics.

sharp peak on the right of the charge spectrum is from a known test pulse. Based
on the peak values, we estimated the charge collection at about 75%, by assuming
the average energy needed to produce an electron ion pair in liquid xenon is 15.6
eV [31]. The energy resolution for the 570 keV gamma rays and 976 keV electron
peaks are 9.5% and 6.5% separately.

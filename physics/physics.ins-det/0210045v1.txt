Abstract. The preliminary results of an aging test performed at the CERN Gamma Ir-
radiation Facility on a single–gap RPC prototype developed for the LHCb Muon System are
presented. The results are based on an accumulated charge density of 0.42 C/cm2, correspond-
ing to about 4 years of LHCb running at the highest background rate. We observe a rise in the
dark current and noise measured with source oﬀ. The current drawn with source on steadily
decreased, possibly indicating an increase of resistivity of the chamber plates. The performance
of the chamber, studied with a muon beam under several photon ﬂux values, is found to still
fulﬁll the LHCb operation requirements.

Introduction.

The LHCb experiment [ 1] has chosen to equip about 48% of the
Muon System [ 2] with Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors. These detectors will
be subject to a very large particle ﬂux, potentially dangerous from the point of view of
detector aging 2. In the regions covered by RPCs, the maximum particle rate is expected
to vary between 0.19 in region 4 and 0.75 kHz/cm2 in region 3 (see [ 2] for a deﬁnition of the
regions). This leads, under reasonable hypothesis 3, to total integrated charge densities
between 0.35 C/cm2 (region 4) and 1.1 C/cm2 (region 4) for 10 years running. These
charge densities are signiﬁcantly larger than those expected by ATLAS [ 3] and CMS
experiments [ 4], whose aging tests accumulated at most about 0.3 C/cm2 [ 6], clearly
insuﬃcient to draw conclusions about LHCb RPCs. An extensive aging program has
been therefore devised for the LHCb needs exploiting the large CERN Gamma Irradiation
Facility (GIF) [ 7], where a 137Cs gamma source of about 655 GBq is available. This paper
reports the preliminary results of the ﬁrst part of the test performed with a prototype
chamber during January-December 2001. The second part, currently under preparation,
will be done with close-to-ﬁnal LHCb chambers and is expected to start March 2002.

2 Aging in RPCs is due mostly to the current ﬂowing through the resistive plates; it has been shown,
indeed, that the irradiation of bakelite slabs with photons up to an integrated dose of 20 kGy does not
produce any degradation in the bakelite properties [ 5].
3 Namely: i) running at half maximum rate; ii) assuming an average avalanche charge of 30 pC [ 5].

Setup of the aging test. The prototype RPC used for the test (irradiated RPC) is
a single gap oiled chamber, with active area 50x50 cm2, made with 2 mm thick phenolic
bakelite plates with nominal resistivity ρ = 9 · 109 Ω cm. This RPC was placed in front of
the source at a distance varying between 0.5-1 m and a photon ﬂux of about 1-2 kHz/cm2.
To facilitate disentangling the eﬀects due to variations in the environment parameters -
such as temperature, pressure or gas quality - from those due to the irradiation, a second
chamber (reference RPC), identical to the irradiated one, was placed just outside the irra-
diation area. The RPCs were operated with a gas mixture consisting of 95% C2H2F4, 4%
i−C4H10, 1% SF6. To simulate the LHCb conditions and perform the test in a reasonable
amount of time, the applied voltage was chosen in such a way to have an average avalanche
charge Qγ of about 50 pC, which, at the rate quoted above, yields a current density of
about 80 nA/cm2. All the relevant parameters of the test - temperature, pressure, high
voltage and currents drawn by the chambers - were continuously recorded. In Fig. 1a the
current drawn by the irradiated RPC and by the reference RPC during the aging test are
shown as a function of time; these currents have been corrected for temperature variations,
assuming I=I0 exp(αT) with α chosen such that intra-day ﬂuctuations are eliminated. As
it is clearly visible from the top plot, the current drawn by the irradiated RPC decreased
with time. The current drawn by the reference RPC is reasonably stable and constant
during the test. By integrating the measured current, the total charge accumulated by
the irradiated RPC has been found to be 0.42 C/cm2, representing about 4 LHCb years
in regions 3 and to more than 10 LHCb years in regions 4. The charge integrated by the
reference RPC is 0.02 C/cm2.

Measurements after the aging test. The general behavior and performance of the
irradiated RPC has been checked using the source and the muon beam available at the
GIF. The combined use of the gamma source and the beam allows a test of the chamber
performance under background conditions very similar to the ones encountered in the
experiment. Measurements were performed with diﬀerent photon ﬂuxes, ranging from
zero (source oﬀ) up to a maximum of about 1 kHz/cm2. The chambers were operated
in the same conditions as in the aging test. The eﬃciency was evaluated by tracking the
beam particles with a scintillator hodoscope and with an additional 10×10 cm2 RPC. The
photon ﬂuxes were estimated from the chamber counting rates measured during dedicated
oﬀ-spill gates. Data were collected at three diﬀerent source attenuation values, namely
attenuation 1, 2 and 5 corresponding roughly to 1 kHz/cm2, 0.7 kHz/cm2 and 0.4 kHz/cm2
photon ﬂuxes respectively.

The performances of the irradiated RPC are still very good and basically indistinguish-
able from the ones of reference chamber; as an example the eﬃciency curves are shown in
Fig. 1b for diﬀerent photon ﬂuxes 4.

In Fig. 1c the dark currents drawn by the two RPCs as a function of the applied voltage
- measured before, during and at the end of the aging test - are shown. A large increase
of the dark current drawn by the irradiated RPC can be clearly observed. The eﬀect of
the irradiation amounts, at a possible working point, to about 1.5 nA/cm2. This increase
is correlated with a corresponding increase in dark noise rate, but its origin is still under

4The shift in the plateau position was observed also before the irradiation test and is probably due to a
relative mis-calibration of the two sets of readout electronics; it is also compatible with a diﬀerence in
gap size within tolerances.

investigation. However, this increase in dark current density is still signiﬁcantly below
the limit of 3 nA/cm2 set in the LHCb-µ TDR [ 2].

The currents drawn by the two chambers under irradiation and diﬀerent photon ﬂuxes
are shown in Fig. 1d: the irradiated RPC clearly draws less current than the reference one,
indicating that Qγ, which can be obtained from the ratio of current to measured-hit-rate,
is smaller in the irradiated RPC.

The eﬀect can be interpreted within a model introduced in Ref. [ 8] in which it is
assumed that, under a high particle ﬂux, the RPC working point is determined by an
eﬀective voltage Vgas = V − IR where V is the applied voltage, I the current drawn by
the RPC and R the resistance of the resistive plates. Under these assumptions, quantities
such as Qγ are universal functions of the gas properties and of Vgas. Figure 1e shows that
this assumption works reasonably well when the appropriate value for R is used: Rirr =
23.1 MΩ and Rref = 6.6 MΩ respectively corresponding to equivalent bakelite resistivities
ρirr = 1.4 × 1011 Ωcm and ρref = 4.1 × 1010 Ωcm. This model, therefore, suggests that the
radiation caused a signiﬁcant increase of resistance in the irradiated RPC.

An increase in resistivity would result in a limitation of the rate capability of the
detectors. Figure 1f shows the eﬃciency of the two chambers, normalized to the value
obtained with source oﬀ, as a function of the photon ﬂux for three diﬀerent high voltage
values. No evidence of a diﬀerent behavior between the two RPCs up to a ﬂux of more
than 1 kHz/cm2 is observed, showing that these RPC can satisfy the LHCb requirements
at least for 4 years running in the worst expected background conditions.

Summary and conclusions. A charge density of 0.42 C/cm2 has been accumulated
on a single gap, oiled, low-resistivity RPC. Dark currents and noise rates, measured with
source oﬀ, clearly rose. The current measured with source on steadily decreased, possibly
indicating an increase of the bakelite resistivity. The performances of the chamber are not
aﬀected at least up to 1 kHz/cm2, still satisfying the LHCb requirements. The integrated
charge corresponds to about 4 years of LHCb at the highest expected background rate.

Abstract

A small drift chamber was read out by means of a MediPix2 readout chip as
direct anode. A Micromegas foil was placed 50 µm above the chip, and electron
multiplication occurred in the gap. With a He/Isobutane 80/20 mixture, gas multi-
plication factors up to tens of thousands were achieved, resulting in an eﬃciency for
detecting single electrons of better than 90% . We recorded many frames containing
2D images with tracks from cosmic muons. Along these tracks, electron clusters
were observed, as well as δ-rays.

1 Introduction

Recently [1] we have demonstrated the possibility to read out a drift chamber
by means of a direct, pixel segmented active anode. Images of the interaction
of 55Fe quanta with the gas were obtained (see Figure 1) with a rather low gas
ampliﬁcation factor, since these quanta create some 220 primary electrons in
a small volume of argon gas. The aim of the research presented in this letter
is to prove the feasibility of the detection of single (drifting) electrons, based
on the same pixel sensor/Micromegas combination.

to develop a single-electron sensitive monolithic device
Our goal
T imeP ixGrid consisting of a CMOS pixel matrix T imeP ix covered with a
Micromegas [2]. Each pixel will be equipped with a preamp, a discriminator, a
threshold DAC and time stamp circuitry. Such a sensor would replace the wires
(or GEMs, or Micromegas), anode pads, feedthroughs, readout electronics and
cables of TPCs and could generally be applied in gaseous (drift) chambers.
We intend to integrate the Micromegas grid onto the T imeP ix chip by means
of wafer post-processing technology (InGrid).

In Section 2 the test chamber including the MediPix2 readout chip and the
Micromegas are described. In Section 3 details on single electron detection and
signal development are presented. Section 4 describes the data readout and the
analysis of the cosmic ray tracks. It includes a discussion on the observation
of so-called Moir´e patterns in the detected hit pixel distribution. The paper
ends with conclusions on the present work and an outlook to our future plans.

2 The chamber, MediPix2 and Micromegas

2.1 The chamber

The test chamber is depicted in Figure 2. Above an aluminum base plate, a
cathode foil is ﬁxed, by means of spacers, forming a drift gap of 15 mm height.
By means of a cut-out in the base plate, the MediPix2 chip (mounted on a
brass pedestal), is placed ﬂush with the base plate upper plane. On top of the
chip, a Micromegas foil, ﬁxed on a frame, is held in position by means of two
silicon rubber strings (see Figure 3).

2.2 The MediPix2 CMOS pixel sensor

A MediPix2 chip [3], [4], [5] was applied as experimental readout device. This
256 pixels, each with dimensions
CMOS chip contains a square matrix of 256
55 µm2. Each pixel is equipped with a low-noise preamp, discriminator,
55
threshold DACs, a 14-bit counter and communication logic. One edge of the
chip has aluminum bonding pads. The outer dimensions of the chip are 16.12
×
14.11 mm2. The MediPix2 chip has been designed for X-ray imaging applica-
tions. For that particular application, an X-ray semiconductor converter (i.e. Si
or CdZnTe), in the form of a corresponding pixel matrix, is mounted onto the
MediPix2 chip, by means of bump-bonding. The assembly of a MediPix2 chip
and an X-ray converter forms a complete X-ray imaging device. For each pixel
the number of absorbed X-ray quanta in a given acquisition time is counted,

2

and the combined pixel content forms the X-ray image. In our application we
use the “naked” MediPix2 chip, without an X-ray convertor.

Originally, each pixel of the MediPix2 chip is covered for a large part with
an insulating passivation layer; the conductive pad (octagonally shaped, 25
µm wide) is large enough to accommodate a bump bond sphere. The electric
ﬁeld in the gap between the MediPix2 and the Micromegas is in the order of
7 kV/mm, and discharges were expected when some 70% of the anode surface
is covered with an insulating material.

In order to prevent these discharges, the MediPix2 wafers were post-processed
by MESA+ [6]. The post-processing consisted of a deposition of a thin alu-
minum layer using lift-oﬀ lithography. This allows deposition of metal on the
anode matrix without modiﬁcation of the bond pads. The pixel pads were thus
enlarged to reach a metal coverage of 80% of the anode plane (see Figure 4).
Electrical tests showed that the preampliﬁer functionality was unaﬀected by
this post-processing. We have applied both the modiﬁed and the non-modiﬁed
versions of the MediPix2 chip.

2.3 The Micromegas

The Micromegas is a copper foil, thickness 5 µm, with holes of 35 µm di-
ameter in a square pattern with 60 µm pitch [7]. At the foil side facing the
MediPix2 chip, poly-imide pillars (height 50 µm, diameter 80 - 140 µm, pitch
(square) 840 µm) are attached. The Micromegas, in its frame, was held on
the MediPix2 chip by means of two silicon rubber strings. When the voltage
on the Micromegas was applied (200 - 500 V), the electrostatic force pulls the
mesh towards the chip, and the insulating pillars deﬁne the proper gap size.

In order to prevent HV breakdowns, a square kapton foil, with a square hole
10.5 mm2, was placed between the Micromegas and the MediPix2.

The chamber was placed such that the drift direction was vertical. The ﬁducial
15 mm3 is hit by a cosmic ray particle about
drift volume of 10.5
once per minute [8].

3 Single electron detection; signal development

A muon, originating from a cosmic shower, traversing the drift volume, will
create clusters of electrons along its track. The cluster density, and the distri-
bution of the number of electrons per cluster depends on the gas composition,
gas density and the muon momentum. If argon is the main component of the

3

gas (at atmospheric pressure), some 3 clusters per mm are created for a mini-
mum ionising muon, and the average number of electrons per cluster is 2.5 [9].
Consequently, on average some 7 primary electrons are created per track length
of 1 mm. The mean distance between two primary electrons, projected onto the
anode plane, is much larger than the pixel pitch, and therefore typically single
electrons will enter a Micromegas hole. For this reason the single-electron re-
sponse is essential for the performance of the pixel-segmented anode readout.
The counting of primary ionisation clusters would allow a precise measurement
of the energy loss dE/dx [10].

After an electron has entered a hole, it will be multiplied, and the number of
electrons grows exponentially towards the anode pads. The centre-of-gravity of
the points of electron-ion separations is positioned at D ln 2/ ln M away from
the anode, where D is the distance between the Micromegas and the anode
and M is the gas multiplication factor. With D = 50 µm and M = 3000 the
charge centre-of-gravity is about 4 µm away from the anode. The electrons
will all arrive within 1 ns at the anode. Most of the ions, moving much slower,
arrive within 30 - 50 ns at the Micromegas, depending on the gas composition
and pressure. If a point charge crosses the avalanche gap, then the potentials
of both the Micromegas and the anode change linearly with the distance of
the point charge to the anode plane. The charge on the anode pad below the
avalanche is the sum of the negative electron charge and the positive induced
ion charge. The fast component has an amplitude of 10% of the total charge.
The latter (slow) component decreases during the drift of the ions towards the
Micromegas. On adjacent pads, however, the same ions will induce a positive
charge, which will be at maximum when the ions are halfway (after some 25
ns) between the anode and the Micromegas. This charge is only a fraction of
the avalanche charge, and is back to zero after the arrival of the ions at the
Micromegas. On these pads we may thus expect a bipolar current signal.

The peaking time constant of the MediPix2 preamp/shaper is 150 ns. This
is large with respect to time constants of the signal development. The
preamp/shaper output is therefore proportional to the avalanche charge, and
the discriminator threshold can be expressed unambiguously in the number of
electrons appearing at the input pad.

Although the design value of the input noise equivalent of the pixel preamps
was 90 electrons, the thresholds were set at 3000 electrons in order to limit
background hits due to (digital) feedback noise, possibly caused by the 4 mm
long bonding wires.

The average of the number of electrons in an avalanche, initiated by a single
electron is the gas multiplication factor M [9]. The ﬂuctuations in the number
of electrons in an avalanche follow an exponential function [11]:

4

p(n) = 1

M e− n

M

where p(n) equals the probability to have an avalanche with n electrons in
total. The avalanche distribution is shown for several values of the gain M in
Figure 5. Since the preamp noise is small with respect to the threshold, and
since there is no electron attachment, we apply the simple exponential distri-
bution instead of approaches like the Polya distributions [12] which include
several 2nd order eﬀects.

With a threshold set at T electrons, avalanches smaller than that are not
detected. The eﬃciency ǫ to detect single electrons is then given by:

ǫ = e− T

M

If, for instance, the threshold is set to a value that equals the gain, the eﬃciency
equals 1/e = 0.37. In Figure 6 the eﬃciency curve is depicted as a function of
the gain M for a threshold T = 3000. We would like to keep the gas gain as low
as possible in order to a) limit the risk of discharges and ageing and b) limit
the ion space charge. With the present MediPix2, with its lowest threshold of
3000 electrons, a gain of 10k would correspond to a single electron eﬃciency
of 0.74. For this reason we used He mixtures which allow a high gain, with a
small risk of discharges.

Due to discharges, four MediPix2 chips were destroyed within 24 hours of
operation. The MediPix2 chip has no protection circuitry at its pixel input
pads other than the source and drain diﬀusions of the transistors responsible
for leakage current compensation. We noticed some damage of the pixel pads,
probably due to a high temperature in the discharge region. For InGrid,
we intend to eliminate discharge damage by a) covering the bottom of the
Micromegas with a (high) resistive layer, limiting the participating charge, b)
covering the anode pads with a (high) resistive layer, in combination with c)
a protective network, for each pixel, connected to the anode pad.

4 Results

4.1 Cosmic ray tracks and data readout; calibration

The MediPix2 sensor can be externally enabled and stopped, followed by a
readout sequence in which the pixel counter data is transfered to a computer.
We enabled the counters during an exposure time of 15 or 60 s, followed by
recording the image frame in the form of 65k counter contents. No trigger was
applied.

The (positive) charge signals on the Micromegas were read out by means of a
low-noise charge sensitive preamp, with a decay time constant of 1 µs. Signals
from an 55Fe source could be recorded, and the preamp was calibrated with
charge signals from a block wave, injected by means of a 10 pF capacitor.
Together with the known number of primary electrons per 55Fe quantum, the
gas ampliﬁcation can be measured.

Some typical events are shown in Figures 7-9. Figure 7 shows a cosmic event
with environmental background. Figure 8 shows a cosmic muon that knocks
out a delta electron. Figure 9 shows a selected cosmic muon. The selection
cuts are described below. In this event the eﬀect of diﬀusion can be observed
in the spread of the hits along the track.

A selection to obtain a sample of clean cosmic events was made. For the
data a map of the noisy pixels was made. The signal from the edges and the
ineﬃcient upper left corner of the detector were removed. First, a straight
line was searched using a Hough transform. Pixels within a distance of 20
pixels are associated to the track. The following quantities were calculated:
the number of associated pixels, the r.m.s. of the distance to the track, the
track length in the detector plane Ld (in mm). The full 3D track length L
(in mm) is estimated as L = qL2
d + 152. The track is split into two equal
parts and the minimum r.m.s. value of the two parts is calculated. Clusters
are formed by stepping along the track and grouping all hits within a distance
of 5 pixels. The number of clusters is counted.

The following criteria were applied to select an event:

•

•
•
•

the number of associated pixels larger than 5 and the fraction of associated
pixels to the track to the total number of pixels hit larger than 80%;
Ld larger than 2.75 mm (i.e. 50 pixels);
the r.m.s. less than 4 ;
the number of associated pixels per millimeter of 3D track length should be
less than 4.

In total 164 events were selected in the data. The distributions of some physical
quantities are shown in Figure 10.

A simulation programme was written generating cosmic minimum ionising

6

cos2 θ. The muon was tracked through
particles with an angular distribution
∝
the sensitive volume of the detector. Clusters were generated with an average
of 1.4 per mm and per cluster 3.16 electrons were generated using a Poissonian
distribution [13]. The electrons were drifted toward the MediPix2 detector with
a diﬀusion constant of 220 µm per √cm. Ineﬃcient zones of the MediPix2
detector in the region between the pixels and below the pillars were put in.
The detector is assumed to have an eﬃciency of 100% in the eﬃcient zones.
Note that multiple hits on a single pixel are at present not separated. The
same selection cuts were applied to data and simulation.

The distribution of the minimum r.m.s. is sensitive to the diﬀusion constant.
Data give an average value of 2.0 pixels (simulation 2.4). This implies that
the diﬀusion constant is slightly better than 220 µm per √cm. The observed
number of pixels hit per mm is 1.83 on average (2.70 simulation). The number
of clusters per mm is 0.52 (simulation 0.60). The average 3D track length is
16.5 mm. The number of clusters per mm agrees within 15% with the sim-
ulation, the number of electrons within 35%. Note that a 100% eﬃciency is
assumed for the detector. Ineﬃciencies have also more impact on the number
of electrons than on the number of clusters. If we take into account system-
atic uncertainties on the expected number of clusters and electrons per mm,
uncertainties on the eﬃciency and operating conditions of the detector, we
ﬁnd the agreement reasonable. Later experiments will focus on a more precise
quantitative understanding of the detector.

4.2 Moir´e eﬀects

Figure 11 shows an image, obtained after irradiating the chamber with β’s
from a 90Sr source. The top-left corner of the image is clearly less eﬃcient.
This is due to the non-ﬂatness of the Micromegas in its frame. Apparently,
the electrostatic force could not entirely eliminate the warp in the Micromegas
foil. Here, the pillars are not in contact with the MediPix2 surface. The gap is
wider and the gain is reduced. The dead regions due to the pillars are clearly
visible as well.

Figure 12 shows the image, taken with a non-modiﬁed MediPix2 sensor, after
irradiating the drift volume with the 90Sr source. Band-shaped regions with a
reduced eﬃciency are clearly visible. Note that these bands are present in two
perpendicular directions. The same eﬀect is visible in an image (Figure 13)
which is the sum of all cosmic rays obtained during one night of data taking,
again with a non-modiﬁed MediPix. The corresponding image from a modiﬁed
MediPix2 is shown in Figure 14, where bands are still present, but much less
pronounced. The bands can well be explained in terms of a Moir´e eﬀect: the
55 µm2) does not match the pitch of
pixel size of the MediPix2 sensor (55

×

7

60 µm2). Consequently, the hole position
the holes in the Micromegas (60
with respect to its nearest pixel centre, shifts when one follows a pixel row or
pixel column. The relative hole position repeats after

60−55 = 12 pixels.

×

60

The Moir´e eﬀect can be understood in terms of the pixel signal amplitude
being dependent of the relative position of a Micromegas hole and the pixel
pad. Such a variation could not be explained by the charge sharing between
two or four pixels for avalanches (with a certain width), located in the region
near a pixel edge, because we did not observe the consequent eﬀect of having
signiﬁcantly more clusters with two, three or four hit pixels in the same less
eﬃcient regions.

Instead, the less eﬃcient regions can be explained by the partly insulator-
covered anode. If a Micromegas hole is located above the joint of two pixels,
or above the four adjacent corners of four pixels, the drifting electron will
be pulled towards one pad which is relatively far away. Along this drift path
the electric ﬁeld is less strong, and the gain is smaller. This eﬀect explains
the diﬀerence in the amplitudes of the Moir´e eﬀect when using modiﬁed or
non-modiﬁed MediPix2 sensors.

The probability for two-fold clusters was found to be homogeneous, and not
subject to the Moir´e eﬀect, but the measured value was found to be signiﬁ-
cantly higher than the MonteCarlo simulation (30% and 10%, respectively).
We explain this by the occurrence of very large but not rare avalanche charges,
following the distribution shown in Figure 5. A neighbouring pixel can be hit
due to capacitive crosstalk, in spite of the (positive) induced charge.

5 Conclusions and Outlook

We have demonstrated that single electrons can be detected with an assembly
of a CMOS pixel chip and a Micromegas foil, with an eﬃciency larger than
0.9, in a He based gas mixture. Bubble chamber like images of cosmic ray
tracks have been obtained and even δ-electrons could be observed. The device
allowed to reconstruct the number of primary ionisation clusters per unit of
track length, giving the possibility of a measurement of the ionisation loss
dE/dx.

For the future T imeP ixGrid, the grid holes are precisely centered above the
pixel pads, eliminating the non-homogeneity of the eﬃciency. The fact that the
non-modiﬁed MediPix could stand the strong electric ﬁeld, together with its
strong Moir´e eﬀect makes us conﬁdent that we can apply a pixel circuit with
small pads, provided that the grid holes are well centered above the pads. The
pad capacity can be kept small, simplifying the pixel input circuit. The inter-

8

pad capacity is then also small, reducing the crosstalk between neighbouring
pixels. A very small pad may reduce the maximum radiation dose, due to
ageing, and an optimum must be found.

The combination of a pixel sensor and a Micromegas oﬀers an instrument
capable to give a full 2D image of all single electrons in a gaseous volume.
By replacing the MediPix2 sensor with a T imeP ix chip, a full 3D image is
expected to be within reach. These circuits will open new possibilities for
particle detection, in terms of position resolution, track separation and energy
loss measurements. As an other example, the polarisation of X-ray quanta
can be measured [14], after its interaction with gas, from the direction of the
photo-electron, which is registered accurately with the new device. Applied
with a thin drift space of one mm, the device could be used as a fast vertex
detector in high radiation environments.

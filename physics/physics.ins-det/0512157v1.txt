Abstract

Physics goals of the STAR Experiment at RHIC in recent (and future) years
drive the need to operate the STAR TPC at ever higher luminosities, leading to
increased ionization levels in the TPC gas. The resulting ionic space charge intro-
duces ﬁeld distortions in the detector which impact tracking performance. Further
complications arise from ionic charge leakage into the main TPC volume from the
high gain anode region. STAR has implemented corrections for these distortions
based on measures of luminosity, which we present here. Additionally, we highlight
a novel approach to applying the corrections on an event-by-event basis applicable
in conditions of rapidly varying ionization sources.

1 Introduction

The time projection chamber (TPC) used by the STAR experiment at RHIC
has several potential sources of ﬁeld distortions [1]. While most of these sources
are static, the buildup of slow-drifting positively charged ions in the volume
gas generated from standard operation of the TPC varies with the quantity
of charged particles traversing the TPC, and thereby both the luminosity of

the collider and the multiplicity of charged particles emitted by the collisions.
The variations in this “space charge” can occur on time scales down to what
it takes the ions to drift the length of the chamber, which is approximately
one half second for the STAR TPC.

2 Space Charge Distortions

Modeling the distortions due to space charge is a straightforward process be-
ginning with a postulation of the typical three-dimensional distribution of
ionization in the TPC. The nearest measure we have of this in STAR is a
record of the distribution of electron clusters reaching the TPC endcap aver-
aged over many events using a so-called “zero-bias” trigger (which is random
with respect to collision times, removing any biases related to the deﬁnition of
a collision). This measure integrates out any drift-direction dependencies, but
compares well in radial dependence (approximately as inverse radius squared)
for √sNN = 200 Au+Au collisions to a simulation using the HIJET event
generator [2]. The simulation indicates a uniform distribution of charge in the
drift direction.

We use the HIJET charge distribution integrated along the distance from the
endcap to any point in space (representing the eﬀect of continual collision con-
tributions) in conjunction with the boundary conditions of grounded surfaces
surrounding the TPC gas volume to solve for the electrical potential due to
space charge. An analytical solution is not achievable, so we use a numerical
relaxation to solve for the potential on a grid in two dimensions (with assumed
azimuthal symmetry) and interpolate. An electric ﬁeld is obtained from the
potential and is treated as a perturbation atop the normal drift ﬁeld. The
distortions to the measured positions of electron clusters are then calculated
by integrating the eﬀects of this perturbing ﬁeld (which depend on operating
conditions of the chamber) along the path from a point in the TPC to the
endcap where the clusters are measured [1]. The amplitude of this distortion
is directly proportional to the quantity of space charge (ρSC) present. In prac-
tice, we calibrate the average charge density over the volume of the chamber:
ρSC/ǫ0

Because the Lorentz force on the drifting electron clusters is proportional
to the cross product of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld (aligned along the
drift direction in STAR) vectors, the principal distortion of consequence is
azimuthal, and is plotted in Fig. 1. This distortion has the eﬀect of rotating
reconstructed tracks in the transverse plane about a point midway along their
path through the TPC.

3 Space Charge Corrections

Knowing ρSC is suﬃcient to subtract the calculated distortions from mea-
sured electron cluster positions to obtain their approximate original, undis-
torted positions. In the absence of direct measures of ρSC, a measure of the
distortion to tracks (ﬁt from distorted clusters) may suﬃce to indirectly de-
termine ρSC. Simulation shows that for any given distorted primary particle
track, its signed distance of closest approach (sDCA) 1 to the collision ver-
tex is approximately linearly proportional to space charge, and we can obtain
C sim
track depends on the locations of points on the
track. Each real track can then be used to derive an observed space charge:

To understand the scale of this distortion, it is worthwhile to note that some
recorded events exhibited beyond 1cm oﬀsets in

track distributions. 2

A distribution of ρobs
SC values from any given collision event will include a
background from secondaries which naturally do not point to the collision
vertex, and will be smeared by the intrinsic resolution of the TPC to measure
sDCA. As seen in the distribution from a single very high multiplicity event
in Fig. 2, the centroid of a peak formed by primaries provides a means to
determine ρobs

SC more accurately.

1 The sign is determined by the Z-direction of the cross product of the track mo-
mentum vector at its closest approach and the vector pointing to the collision vertex,
essentially identifying on which “side” of the vertex the reconstructed track passes.
2 We use only TPC tracks with at least 25 points, pseudorapidity within
1, and
transverse momentum between 0.3-2.0 GeV/c for all sDCA and ρSC measurements.

determined from individual tracks in a single high-multiplicity event. The mean of
a Gaussian peak (formed from primaries) is ﬁt to extract ρobs

SC for that event.

To be eﬀective, the value of ρSC used to correct the distortions must be up-
dated on time scales shorter than the ﬂuctuations caused by collider operating
conditions. During the 2000 through 2003 years of operating RHIC, scalers of
trigger counter rates recorded online (during runs) every 30 seconds served to
measure these ﬂuctuations suﬃciently [3]. Along with a signiﬁcant luminosity
increase in 2004, however, these ﬂuctuations were observed in the systematic
behavior of sDCA distributions on sub-second time scales.

An event-by-event (E-by-E) method using only ρobs
SC from individually recorded
events suﬀers from insuﬃcient statistics to get a good measure in most events.
To compensate, we can take advantage of the fact that ρSC ﬂuctuations cannot
occur on time scales much shorter than the drift time of ions in the TPC. We
do this by building a running sum of ρobs
SC from each event and previous events
downweighted appropriately by their age. Because we measure ρobs
SC from events
which have already been corrected with some value ρused
SC , we set the new value
SC = ρused
to be ρnew
SC . This method is self-correcting in that even if the
conversion factors C sim
track are not perfect, ρSC will quickly converge to a value
which brings the sDCA distributions to peak at zero.

SC + ρobs

Weaknesses in this technique include events at the start of data ﬁles (for which
there are no previous events), sizable time gaps between some events, and
series of low multiplicity events for which insuﬃcient statistics are obtained
within short time scales. The ﬁrst problem is solved by performing a prepass
on the ﬁrst few events in each ﬁle to determine a viable initial ρprepass
, which is
then used in the production pass until the E-by-E method becomes applicable.
The latter issues are handled by falling back to ρprepass
for such events until
the E-by-E method can again be useful. Backgrounds which introduce charge
distributions diﬀerent from the HIJET model can also degrade performance.

Fig. 3 demonstrates that the ﬂuctuations in ρSC determined by the E-by-E
method are not artiﬁcial. In two independent but concurrent sets of events,
similar behaviors can be seen on sub-second time scales, while diﬀerences
in the method of about 0.0001 V/cm2.

4 Ion Leakage Around the Gated Grid

Studying residuals of TPC cluster positions from track ﬁts revealed that an
additional source of ions is also present in the TPC. A discontinuity in the
residuals at the gap between the inner and outer readout wire chambers of the
TPC, evident in Fig. 4, is consistent with incomplete blockage (by the gated
grid) at this gap of ions created in the high gain region around the anode
wires. This allows a sheet of ions to ﬂow from this gap across the TPC gas
volume to the cathode.

Again, we can model the distortions from this leak around the gated grid in
the same manner as the space charge, providing a map of cluster position
corrections whose magnitude is proportional to the amount of leaked charge
(ρleak). These distortions similarly aﬀect sDCA, and ρleak was found to scale
with collision rates in the same manner as ρSC. A calibration was performed
to ﬁnd the ratio (D) between ρleak and ρSC which removed the residual discon-
tinuities while simultaneously zeroing sDCA in a sample of events. And the
E-by-E correction was modiﬁed to track the two distortions together:

5 Summary

We have identiﬁed and corrected for distortions due to ion charge buildup in
the STAR TPC. With the onset of signiﬁcant short time scale ﬂuctuations
in the sources of the ions which were not monitored with ﬁne time granu-
larity during data acquisition, we have developed a technique to determine
and adjust for the ﬂuctuations during reconstruction on an event-by-event
basis. Performance of the corrections can be assessed by examining the dis-
as a function of luminosity, shown in Fig. 5. Here we see
tribution of

luminosities, and the mean is kept to within a few hundred microns of zero.
In 2005, online monitoring with one second granularity was implemented and
will provide further assessment of the technique’s success.

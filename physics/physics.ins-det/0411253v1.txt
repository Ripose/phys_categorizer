A CONCEPTION OF THE PHOTON COLLIDER BEAM DUMP

Photon beams at photon colliders are very narrow, powerful and can not be de-
ﬂected. For the beam dump at the TESLA-like collider we suggest to use a long
gas (Ar) spoiler in front of the water absorber, this solves the overheating and
mechanical stress problems. The neutron background at the interaction point is
estimated.
The beam dump at the linear collider TESLA suggested for the e+e−
interaction region consists of the deﬂecting magnets (deﬂect bunches inside
one train) and the water vessel at the distance 250 m from the interaction
point. 1 However it does not suit for the photon collider because the photon
beam is neutral. Characteristic beam parameters: N = 2 · 1010, the number
of bunches in one train 2820, ∆t = 337 nsec, ν = 5 Hz, the angular divergence
∼ 10−5. The beam is mixed, about half of the energy is
σθx
carried by electrons and half by photons.

∼ 3 · 10−5, σθy

Our scheme of the beam dump for the photon collider is depicted in Fig.1.
In addition to the TESLA TDR solution we added the beam spoiler of 4–5
radiation length thickness, the cheapest solution is Ar at the pressure 3–5 atm
(XAr = 110 m at P=1 atm). The deﬂecting (rotating) magnets are needed to
decrease the stress in the entrance Al-Be window situated at the distance 100
m from the IP. The circle radius of R = 0.5–1 cm is suﬃcient. The thickness of
the entrance window is small, therefore the density of electrons from the pair
production by the narrow photon beam in the entrance window is acceptable.
In the gas, photons and electrons produce showers and due to the multiple
scattering the density of particle at the exit window of the gas vessel and
entrance window of the water beam dump is also acceptable. A third critical
place is the most dense point in the shower situated in the water beam dump
between the entrance window and the shower maximum. In the chosen scheme
the rise of the water temperature at this point is also acceptable.

The simulation using FLUKA code was done for the geometry shown in
Fig.2. Some preliminary results are the following. The maximum ∆T at the
entrance Be-Al window is about 40◦ for R=0.5 cm (sweeping radius). For the
removal of the heat the thermal conductivity is suﬃcient, the gas cooling can
be added, if necessary. The maximum local ∆T at the exit Be-Al window is
small, about 10◦. The maximum local ∆T in the water dump after passage of
the train from 250 GeV photons is 75, 50, 25◦ at the Ar pressure 3, 4, 5 atm,

respectively, and by a factor of 2 lower for incident electrons.

The problem of the mechanical stress in solid materials in the TESLA
beam dump is not important because the train duration is much longer than
the decay time of local stress (r/vsound ∼ 1 µsec).
It is more serious for
warm-LC with short trains.

The simulation gives also an estimate of the neutron ﬂux at IP. For 105
incident 250 GeV electrons and PAr = 4 atm there are 6 neutrons at the IP
plain z = 0 with the radial coordinates r = 1.5, 2.5, 4.5, 14.5, 18.5 21.5 m.
Due to the collimation by the Fe tube we do not expect the uniform density,
the density per cm2 should be larger near the axis. Assuming the uniform
density for three neutrons closest to the axis we ﬁnd the ﬂux 5 · 10−11 n/cm2
per incident electron or about 1.5 · 1011 n/cm2 for 107 sec run time.

It is remarkable that after the replacement of the ﬁrst 20 m of Ar by H2
at the same pressure there is only one neutron at r = 1.5 m for 8 · 105 incident
electrons. With account of collimation by the tube it means the decrease of
the neutron ﬂux at least by a factor of ten!

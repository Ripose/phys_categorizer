Abstract

A ring-imaging ˇCerenkov counter, to be read out by four 100-channel PMT’s, is a
key element of the BRAHMS Experiment. We report here the most recent results
obtained with a prototype tested at the BNL AGS using several radiator gases,
including the heavy ﬂuorocarbon C4F10 . Ring radii were measured for diﬀerent
particles (π−, µ−, e−) for momenta ranging from 2 to 12 GeV/c employing pure
C4F10 as radiator.

1 The BRAHMS Experiment

The BRAHMS Experiment at RHIC consists of two magnetic spectrometer
arms that will survey particle production in Au - Au collisions at 100 GeV/c
per nucleon. The goal of the experiment is to study the system formed by the
two colliding ions in two regions of rapidity. A schematic description of the
BRAHMS setup is shown in Figure 1. The Midrapidity Arm will probe the
particles emerging near y ≈ 0, corresponding to spectrometer angles between
30◦ and 90◦ with respect to the beam line. The Forward Arm will study parti-
cles of higher rapidities, y ≤ 4, corresponding to spectrometer angles ranging
from 2◦ to 30◦.

The particle identiﬁcation is accomplished in each spectrometer with a combi-
nation of Time of Flight arrays and ˇCerenkov counters. Of particular interest
for this presentation is the Particle Identiﬁcation system (PID) of the For-
ward Arm spectrometer, which must identify charged particles with momenta
ranging from 1 to 25 GeV/c.

Particle identiﬁcation at high momentum is done with the second Time of
Flight wall H2 and the Ring Imaging ˇCerenkov detector RICH. Assuming the
expected time resolution of σ = 75 psec, H2 will be able to separate pions
from kaons up to 5.8 GeV/c. and kaons from protons up to 8.5 GeV/c. The

function of the RICH detector is to extend the particle identiﬁcation up to 25
GeV/c. Some considerations of its design are given in the following subsection.

2 Design of the RICH detector for BRAHMS

Figure 2 shows three aspects of the proposed detector, indicating various com-
ponents and dimensions. The lateral dimensions of the radiator volume are
somewhat larger than the aperture of D4 (h × w = 40 × 50cm2). The radiator
has L = 1.5 meters of C4F10 , which at 20◦ C and 1.25 atm. pressure has an
index of refraction n = 1.00185. The spherical mirror has a focal length of 1.5
m and is rotated by an angle α = 8◦, thus shifting the ring image (by 2α) to
a focal plane outside of the volume illuminated by the direct particle ﬂux.

The photon-imaging array consists of four Hamamatsu R-4549-01 detectors,
placed as indicated, deﬁning an image plane some 22 × 22cm2.

The expected performance of this detector, in terms of particle resolution
and eﬃciency, have been outlined previously, [2],[3], and are supported by the
results of the prototype tests presented in the following section and also in
Ref. [1].

Simulations have been performed using event generators appropiate for Au-
Au collisions, in order to determine the multiplicities expected for the various
detectors of the Forward arm. Table 1 shows the pertinent data for the RICH
detector, indicating typically one or at most two charged particles per event.

3 The Prototype Detector

The prototype RICH counter is shown schematically in ﬁgure 3 of Ref. [1].
The prototype is similar in general design to that shown in ﬁgure 2, but with
the optical system rotated by 90◦ about the beam axis, such that the reﬂection
angle is now in the horizontal plane.

The detector housing is constructed as a rectangular box, with 2 cm thick
aluminum walls, having inner dimensions of 127×64×46 cm3 (l × w × h). The
construction is such that, using gasket and o-ring seals, the pressure of the
radiator gas may be safely varied from 0 to 1.5 atm absolute. The particle
beam enters and exits through Mylar windows 0.25 mm thick and 15 cm in
diameter, at opposite ends of the long dimension. A 15-cm diameter spherical
mirror, of focal length f = 91.4 cm, is situated at a radiator distance of L =
114 cm, rotated by α = 8◦. A single 100-channel PMT is centered at α = 16◦
at the 91 cm distant focal plane.

The photon detector was a single Hamamatsu R-4549-01, one element of the
four proposed for BRAHMS. This PMT is a 20-stage device having a 10 ×
10cm2 photocathode, with the segmentation deﬁned by a 10 × 10 array of
0.9 × 0.9cm2 anode elements. At the full operating voltage of 2500 Volts, it
provides a current gain of 2 × 107 producing single-photon pulses large enough
to be fed directly to an ADC or timing electronics.

This speciﬁc module employs a special focussing electrode (between cathode
and ﬁrst dynode) which results in a rectangular ﬂat-topped response function
10 × 10mm2, with a very sharp fall oﬀ at the edges. While the photocathode
itself is quite uniform, the gain falls oﬀ a bit (50%) near the edges of the array,
and even more at the four corners. However the signal remains clean, and so
the gain can be compensated in software.

Four identical drift chambers, placed in pairs upstream and dowstream of the
prototype counter, provided tracking for determining the particle trajectory.
Thus, the expected position of the center of each RICH ring on the phototube
is determined to a resolution of approximately 500 µm in both the x and y
directions.

4 Measurements

In previous tests [1], time limitations did not permit a complete ﬁlling of
the radiator volume with pure C4F10 . Our ﬁlling system was based on the
diﬀerence (factor of six) in the molecular weights of the ﬂuorocarbon and
argon, with the heavy gas displacing the lighter one as it is brought into
the bottom of the detector. In reality we found that even though the ﬂow of
C4F10 into the detector was slow, some mixing occurs and 100% concentrations
cannot be reached in a single cycle. The measurements reported in our previous
publication were done with ≈ 70% C4F10 and 30% Argon. This time we simply
evacuated the radiator volume completely and then ﬁlled with pure C4F10 .

Measurements were made for several particle momenta, over the range 2 ≤

3

p ≤ 12 GeV /c, using the (negative) secondary beam from the BNL AGS
accelerator. (The momentum calibration for the beam-line was established in
a separate measurement, employing time-of-ﬂight techniques, to an accuracy
of better than 0.5%). For each setting, the tracking information from four drift
chambers was used to project the expected ring centers onto the PMT matrix.
Given this information, a ring-ﬁtting algorithm was employed to ﬁnd and ﬁt
the ring radius on an event by event basis. The results are shown in Fig. 3,
which plots observed ring-radius versus beam momentum for particles thus
identiﬁed as electrons, muons, and pions. The solid curves are calculated for
the indicated particles, with the focal length and index of refraction as free
parameters. Both results can be seen to agree well with the known value,f =
91.4 cm, and the calculated index of refraction (at 20◦ C, 1 atm ≈ 400 nm) n
= 1.001379 (this index is calculated using measurements in the liquid phase
reported in [5]).

We have investigated the possibility that for larger rings (r≥4.5 cm) edge-
eﬀects may be of importance, resulting in extracted radii somewhat too small.
For this purpose, the spherical mirror was further rotated by an additional
1◦ to α=9◦. The projected ring center was therefore moved by 3.4 cm, such
that one arc of the ring image was well inside the PMT’s photocathode area.
The results for this comparison are shown in Fig. 3 for the electron data at
3 GeV/c. As can be seen, the eﬀect produces, at most, a minimal displacement
in the direction that might have been expected.

As remarked previously [1], the direct determination of the number of photons
detected for a given event is precluded by the exponential shape of the PMT
single-photon response function. Instead, we have measured (over a large num-
ber of events) the statistical variation in the total charge collected per event.
The resultant distribution (≈Gaussian) is then ﬁtted to determine the mea-
sured mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ). The number of detected photons
(n) may then be estimated as n = (µ/σ′)2, where σ′ is deduced by unfolding
the exponential detector response function. We thus estimated (for 12 GeV/c
pions) that n = 26 ± 4, corresponding to N0 = 89 ± 14 cm−1.

5 Summary

The predicted behavior of the RICH detector proposed for BRAHMS has been
investigated and conﬁrmed by these additional measurements with the pro-
totype detector, which were carried out under carefully controlled conditions.
The imaging capabilities (see Fig. 3) and ﬁgure of merit (N0) are found to be
in good agreement with expectations based on the design and performance of
the individual components.

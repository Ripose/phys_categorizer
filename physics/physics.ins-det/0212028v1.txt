(February 2, 2008)

A model of carrier phase measurement (as carried out by a satellite navigation receiver) is
formulated based on electromagnetic theory. The model shows that the phase of the open-circuit
voltage induced in the receiver antenna with respect to a local oscillator (in the receiver) depends
on the relative orientation of the receiving and transmitting antennas. The model shows that using
a single receiving antenna, and making carrier phase measurements to seven satellites, the 3-axis
attitude of a user platform (in addition to its position and time) can be computed relative to an initial
point. This measurement model can also be used to create high-ﬁdelity satellite signal simulators
that take into account the eﬀect of platform rotation as well as translation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Satellite systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GLONASS) were originally designed to provide a user with position and time [1,2,3]. In addition to position and time,
orientation (with respect to some system of coordinates) or attitude information has numerous applications, such as
to aircraft ﬂying by instrument navigation, pointing communications antennas and satellites, unmanned air vehicles
(UAV), and as a source of compass heading. In recent years, attitude (or orientation) information has been obtained
from the GPS by using multiple, widely-separated antennas mounted on a (assumed) rigid platform [4]. When the
rigid platform translates and rotates, the path length changes between the transmitting satellite and each receiving
antenna. Each satellite transmits a (modulated) continuous wave sinusoidal signal. The phase of the voltage induced
in each receiving antenna changes with respect to the phase of a local oscillator in the receiver. A measurement of
this eﬀect is called a carrier phase measurement (or delta-range measurement) and is usually modeled [4] as the phase
diﬀerence (or accumulated phase diﬀerence from some point in time) between the receiver’s internal oscillator and the
voltage induced on the given receiving antenna.

In current GPS receiver technology, this phase change is modeled as arising solely from the change in path length
between transmitting satellite and receiver antenna [4]. This model is used in commercial GPS receivers to determine
the current orientation or attitude of the rigid platform (on which the antennae are mounted) relative to the (platform)
attitude at some initial point in time. The standard model of carrier phase measurement [4] completely neglects the
physical nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (i.e., that it is a vector ﬁeld) and the nature of the detection process that
occurs in a real antenna. The role of the antenna is to convert the vector electromagnetic ﬁeld into a time-dependent
voltage signal.

In recent work, Krall and Bahder [5,6] developed an improved physical model of the carrier phase measurement
process. They have shown that using a single dipole antenna two angles of attitude can be obtained by tracking six
satellites [5,6]. Their model of carrier phase measurement treats the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a vector and includes
orientation eﬀects of the detection process of the receiving antenna. In particular, the model of Krall and Bahder [5,6]
shows that the phase of the open circuit voltage induced in the receiving antenna depends on the relative orientation
of the receiving and transmitting antennas, which is a feature that is neglected by the standard model [4] of carrier
phase measurement [7].

The equations presented by Krall and Bahder [5,6] are speciﬁc to a dipole receiving antenna and these equations
cannot be simply extended to more realistic types of receiving antennas, such as those that are currently used in actual
GPS receivers. Furthermore, the Krall and Bahder equations allow determination of only two angles of attitude, while
many applications require knowledge of all three angles of attitude for a user platform.

In this paper, I generalize the work of Krall and Bahder. I show that, for a general type of antenna, all three angles
of attitude can be computed from carrier phase measurements, i.e., when the receiving antenna has no cylindrical
symmetry. I present a generalized model of the carrier phase measurement process based on the vector eﬀective length
of an arbitrary antenna. The vector eﬀective length characterizes a receiving antenna in terms of a two-component
complex vector ﬁeld, h(θ, φ), on the surface of a unit sphere surrounding the antenna [8,9,10,11]. The spherical polar
angles θ, and φ specify the direction from which the radiation is incident on the receiving antenna, as seen in the
comoving frame of the receiving antenna.

1

The improved model of carrier phase measurement developed below can be used to compute all three angles of
platform attitude from single-antenna carrier phase measurements to seven satellites. Since the phase of the voltage
induced in the receiving antenna depends on the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas, the
attitude of the satellite antennas must be known to the user of the system. For the case of GPS, the satellite orientation
is quite strict because the power in the main antenna beam is centered on the Earth [12]. So the satellite antenna
attitude is assumed known in the model presented below. However, for future high-accuracy attitude determination,
the satellite system should have its navigation message enhanced so that it contains information on the orientation of
each satellite antenna. As a result of this enhancement, the GPS would be a a navigation system that provides users
with their position, time, and orientation (or attitude).

The single-antenna feature of the model presented below permits miniaturization of the attitude determination
system over that of present systems, since multiple antennas are not needed. Consequently, this model is advantageous
in applications that require miniaturization, such as pointing communications antennas, nano-satellites [13], micro air
vehicles (MAV) [14], and wrist-mounted compass heading systems [15]. This model can also be used for developing
a satellite signal simulator that faithfully models carrier phase measurements made by a platform that undergoes
rotation (in addition to translation) such as a satellite, aircraft or missile.

Additionally, in the currently-used multiple-antenna attitude determination systems, higher accuracy of attitude
is achieved with larger antenna separations (baselines). However, in systems with large baselines, alignment of
the antennas, as well as change of antenna orientation due to ﬂexing of the (assumed rigid) mounting base, are
complications that can lead to signiﬁcant phase errors. For this reason, a single-antenna attitude determination
system may be preferable. Alternatively, it may be advantageous to use the model of carrier phase measurement
presented below in multiple antenna systems so that the requirements of platform rigidity and antenna alignment can
be relaxed.

The apparent phase center of a receiving antenna moves as a function of direction of the incident radiation from
the satellite. The direction from which the signal arrives at the receiving antenna, as seen in the comoving frame
of the receiving antenna, depends on the relative velocity of the transmitting and receiving antennas (aberration of
10−5, where v is the
star light eﬀect). This eﬀect was taken into account by Krall and Bahder to ﬁrst order in v/c
speed of the satellite antenna in the comoving frame of the receiving antenna, and c is the speed of light. For typical
satellite navigation applications, the speed of the receiver is small (compared to c) and this aberration eﬀect amounts
to approximately 10−5 radians of angle, and therefore can be neglected. In this work, I neglect this ﬁrst order eﬀect
by dropping terms of ﬁrst order in v/c. However, since the orientation eﬀects (such as dependence of the phase of the
voltage on direction of incident radiation and movement of the apparent phase center) are zeroth-order eﬀects, they
are included in the model below.

∼

In this paper, the standard model of carrier phase measurement is reviewed in section II. Section III, contains a
calculation of the open-circuit voltage induced in a receiving antenna due to the satellite signal. The carrier phase
measurement model based on the open-circuit antenna voltage is formulated in section IV. Section V deals with
application of the measurement model to attitude determination and navigation. Section IV presents a summary of
the ideas involved in this work.

II. STANDARD MODEL OF CARRIER PHASE MEASUREMENT

The standard multiple-antenna technique of attitude determination relies on a simpliﬁed model of carrier phase
measurements [4]. This standard technique makes use of diﬀerences between the phase of a local oscillator and the
phase of the incoming satellite signal, at the positions of the (multiple) receiving antennas. In this technique, the
satellite signal is essentially treated as a scalar wave of amplitude E, given by

E = Eo e

−j(kr−ωt)

R

is the distance from the satellite antenna at transmission point R to receiver
where Eo is a real amplitude, r =
antenna at reception point r, the angular frequency ω = 2πf , f is the frequency of the carrier signal and j = √
1.
The wave propagates with wave vector k = N ω/c = 2πN/λ, at speed c/N , where c is the speed of light and N is
the average index of refraction over the signal’s path. In the simpliﬁed model of carrier phase measurements, the
measured phase is taken to be the phase of the scalar ﬁeld, seen by antenna i at time t at position ri(t), due to a
satellite j at position Rj(t

The satellite receiver has a local oscillator that is not perfect. The imperfection of the oscillator is represented by
the fact that the oscillator does not keep time according to Earth-centered inertial (ECI) coordinate time or universal
coordinated time (UTC), t, but according to its own clock that counts cycles [16] according to a time scale t∗, which
is some function of, say, ECI time t. The oscillator will then have a running phase given by

(4)
where the time scale t∗ is not the same as the ECI (or UTC) time scale t, but there is a functional relation t∗ = t∗(t)
between these two times. The change in phase of the local oscillator since some initial time or epoch, to, can then be
represented by

of cycles. For example, if the geometric range between receiver and satellite is increased by an integer number of
wavelengths, the measured phase diﬀerence, as given in Eq. (7), would be the same due to a diﬀerent integer.

By taking the origin of coordinates near the user platform, and taking diﬀerences of the measured quantities in
Eq. (7), the clock bias ∆t∗ can be eliminated from the unknowns, leaving only geometric quantities, such as the baseline
vectors between antennas, ri

The standard technique [4] for attitude determination, described in Eq. (1)–(9), uses a measurement model of
carrier phase given by Eq. (7), which essentially treats the electromagnetic ﬁeld as a scalar ﬁeld, and neglects its
vector nature. The electromagnetic vector ﬁeld carries additional orientation information that can be exploited to
determine attitude of a user platform. Recently, it was shown that, using a short-dipole receiving antenna to track
signals from six GPS satellites, two angles of attitude can be determined [6,5], i.e., the orientation of the antenna can
be determined up to rotations about its axis. The method used to derive these results was limited to a short-dipole
type of receiving antenna, and to a determination of only two of the three Euler angles of attitude [6,5].

−

In what follows, I show that using a single receiving antenna of arbitrary type, and tracking the carrier phase
from seven satellites, the complete 3-axis attitude (in addition to position and time) can be determined. The results
here are based on a model of the open-circuit voltage induced in the receiving antenna. The model explicitly takes
into account the vector nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld that is broadcast by the satellite. The model shows that
the phase of the voltage induced in the receiving antenna contains an additional phase-shift δs(t), see Eq. (32), that
depends on the relative orientation of the transmitter and receiver antennas. Consequently, given the position and
orientation of the transmitting satellite antennae, the orientation (3-axis attitude) of the receiving antennae can be
computed.

III. OPEN-CIRCUIT ANTENNA VOLTAGE

The basis of the single-antenna method of attitude determination is the open-circuit voltage Vs(t) induced in a

receiving antenna [8,9,10,11] by the radiation ﬁeld from satellite s:

Vs(t) = h(ns)

Es(Ro, t)

·
where Es(Ro, t) is the electric radiation ﬁeld at the receiver antenna located at position Ro at reception time t and
h(ns) is the receiving antenna vector eﬀective length (or eﬀective height), which characterizes the antenna. The unit
vector ns speciﬁes the direction of ﬁeld propagation, as seen in the comoving frame of the receiving antenna. The
origin of this comoving system of coordinates is centered at the receiving antenna, which is at point O. See Fig. 1. In
Eq. (10), both the electric ﬁeld, Es(Ro, t), and the vector eﬀective height, h(ns), are vectors in the comoving frame
of reference of the receiver. The vector ns is given in terms of the polar coordinate angles θs and φs, in the receiving
antenna’s comoving frame:

ns =

[sin θs cos φs a1 + sin θs sin φs a2 + cos θs a3]

−

Here, a1, a2, a3 are the orthonormal unit vectors in the comoving system of coordinates that is centered at the
receiving antenna. Neglecting relativistic aberration, this direction of propagation can be speciﬁed by a unit vector
ns, pointing from the satellite to the receiver, in the ECI coordinate system [17].

The vector eﬀective height, h(ns) in Eq. (10), is a two-dimensional complex vector ﬁeld on the unit sphere sur-
rounding the receiving antenna that describes the receiving properties of an arbitrary antenna. In general, the ﬁeld
h(θ, φ) is speciﬁed on the unit sphere by two complex functions, hθ(θ, φ) and hφ(θ, φ),

h(n) = hθ(θ, φ) aθ + hφ(θ, φ) aφ

where θ and φ are the polar angles (coordinates on the unit sphere), and aθ and aφ are orthonormal basis vectors on
this sphere. The origin of coordinates is co-located with the receiving antenna. In practice, the functions hθ(θ, φ) and
hφ(θ, φ) must be found by computation, or, by experiment. In the case of experiment, these two functions are found
by mapping the far-ﬁeld pattern of the receiving antenna, when it is used in the transmission mode. Then, using the
equation for the far-ﬁeld [9,11]

where Iin is the current through the antenna, ǫ is the permittivity, µ is the permeability of the surrounding medium,
and r is the distance from the antenna, the components of the vector eﬀective height, hθ(θ, φ) and hφ(θ, φ), can
be determined. Note that this procedure is well-deﬁned for any type of receiving antenna. For a discussion of
measurements and theory of elliptically polarized ﬁelds, see Ref. [8,9,10,11] and the coordinated series of papers in
Ref. [18,19,20,21].

The electromagnetic ﬁeld broadcast by the satellite, at the position of the receiver, is a far-ﬁeld. In this far-ﬁeld

region, the general form of the electromagnetic ﬁeld at receiver position Ro at time t is given by the real part of

E(Ro, t) = [u Eu(Θ, Φ)eψu(Θ,Φ) + v Eveψv(Θ,Φ)]

where the vectors u and v are real orthogonal unit vectors that specify the polarization of the ﬁeld and the range,

r =

(tT , RT ). The quantities Eu and Ev are real amplitudes that depend on polar angles Θ and Φ, measured from the
origin at point T at the satellite antenna. See Fig. 1. Each polarization can have an arbitrary phase ψu and ψv. The
ﬁeld given by Eq. (14) is a general elliptically polarized electric ﬁeld.

−

As an example of a speciﬁc case of Eq. (14), consider a GPS satellite, where the ﬁeld near the central beam axis is

a right circularly polarized ﬁeld, given by

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

where E(Θ, Φ) is a real amplitude. If the ﬁeld broadcast by the satellite is not a right circularly polarized ﬁeld, then
Eq. (15) still applies, however, the vectors u and v will have complex phases, u = uoejφu and u = voejφv , where uo

and vo are real orthogonal unit vectors. Consequently, no generalization is lost by using Eq. (15) for the far-ﬁeld of
the satellite. This representation is used below.

Strictly, E(Ro, t) in Eq. (14) is the electric ﬁeld in the comoving frame of the satellite, while Es(Ro, t) in Eq. (10)
is the ﬁeld in the comoving frame of the receiver. The diﬀerence between these two ﬁelds is a quantity of ﬁrst order
in v/c, where v is the speed of the satellite in the frame of reference of the receiver. In what follows, I drop these
ﬁrst order terms in v/c, taking Es(Ro, t)
E(Ro, t). Furthermore, the vectors u and v in Eq. (15) are taken at the
retarded time t

rs/c, which is the time at which the signal left the satellite.

Using the far-ﬁeld of the satellite given by Eq. (15), the open-circuit voltage induced in the receiver antenna due
to the electromagnetic ﬁeld from satellite s, given in Eq. (10), can be written as (summation over repeated indices):

indices occur, unless stated otherwise. The range from the satellite s emmision event to the reception event at the
receiver, in ECI inertial coordinates, is given implicitly by

o(t) and xi

The quantities hi(ns(t)) appearing in Eq. (16) are the components of the vector eﬀective height of the receiving
antenna projected on the ECI Cartesian coordinate basis vectors ei and are given in terms of the spherical basis
components in Eq. (12), by

h(n) = hθ(θ, φ) aθ + hφ(θ, φ) aφ = h1(n) e1 + h2(n) e2 + h3(n) e3

where

h1(n) = hθ(θ, φ) cos θ cos φ
hφ(θ, φ) sin φ
h2(n) = hθ(θ, φ) cos θ sin φ + hφ(θ, φ) cos φ
h3(n) =

hθ(θ, φ) sin θ

−

These components depend on the direction (θ, φ) from which the radiation from satellite s is incident on the receiving
antenna. This direction can be speciﬁed by components of the unit vector ns(t), deﬁned in Eq. (17).

In Eq. (16), the matrix elements Dik(t) specify the attitude of the receiver platform at reception time t. The
attitude is speciﬁed by giving the inner product of the unit vectors ai, i = 1, 2, 3, of the receiver comoving coodinates
with the ECI Cartesian coordinate basis vectors ei:

where the vectors ai(t) are time-dependent, since these vectors correspond to the moving body axes of the receiver.
The receiver platform attitude matrix Dik(t) = Dik(α(t), β(t), γ(t)) has three independent parameters. This attitude
matrix can be conveniently represented in terms of three time-dependent Euler angles, α, β, and γ, by [22]

The phase of the voltage in the receiving antenna, ψs(t) given in Eq. (34), should be compared with the phase of
the scalar ﬁeld, given in Eq. (2). The vector nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld leads to an additional phase shift
δs(t) in Eq. (34). This phase shift is a function of the relative orientation of the satellite and receiver antenna. The
single-antenna method of determining attitude exploits the dependence of the phase δs(t) on the relative orientation
of the satellite and receiver antennas. Note that δs(t) in Eq.(32) depends on receiver antenna parameters hi(ns),
which are deﬁned in Eq. (22)–(24).

The model for the phase of the induced voltage in a receiving antenna, given in Eq.(32), is more accurate than the
standard model in Eq. (2), because it takes into account the orientation of the receiving antenna in the electromagnetic
ﬁeld.

IV. IMPROVED CARRIER PHASE MEASUREMENT MODEL

The satellite receiver has an electronic oscillator, whose phase is given by Eq. (4). The measured quantity is the

phase diﬀerence between the local oscillator and the phase of the voltage in Eq. (34):

ψs(t)

ψosc(t) = ks rs(t) + ω∆t

+ δs(t) + 2πm

∗

where m is an integer, since the relative phase can be measured only up to integer multiples of 2π. For comparison
purposes, Eq. (35) can be put into a notation similar to Eq. (7):
∗

ψis(t)

ψosc(t) = kis ris(t) + ω∆t

+ δis(t) + 2πmis

where the subscript i has been added to index the receiving antenna, and the subscript s still refers to transmitting
satellite s. Comparison of Eq. (36) with Eq. (34) and the previous deﬁnitions for δs(t) makes the meaning of the
terms in Eq. (36) clear.

A. Multiple-Antenna Attitude Determination

For the case of an attitude determination system that uses multiple antennas, Eq. (36) can now be used to form

diﬀerences between two antennas and one satellite, such as is done in standard carrier phase tracking (see Eq.(8)):

where ri are the positions of the receiving antennas at reception time t. The measured phase, as given by Eq. (38),
contains an additional diﬀerence of phase shifts, δis(t)
δks(t), which depends on two attitude matrices, Dis and
Dks, one for each of the two antennas mounted on the user platform. Compare Eq.(38) with Eq.(9). When the two
antennas are identical, and they are mounted on a rigid platform, and they are aligned, then these two matrices are
the same. The diﬀerence of phase shifts δis(t)
δks(t) is essentially zero. Alternatively, if these conditions are not
satisﬁed, then Eq.(38) provides the generalization of Eq.(9), and includes the eﬀects of ﬂexing of the platform and
misalignment of the antennas.

B. Single-Antenna Attitude Determination

The orientation dependence of the phase shift δi(t) in Eq. (32) can be exploited to permit determination of attitude
(by determining α, β, and γ) from carrier phase measurements made by a single antenna. Consider a receiver whose
antenna has a known orientationa and position at some initial time to. The phase change of the oscillator in the
receiver, since the initial time to can be represented by

∆ψosc(t) =

where t is the GPS time (or coordinate time in the ECI (or other) frame of reference) that is associated with a time
t∗ on the clock that counts oscillator cycles [16]. The oscillator in the user’s receiver is assumed to be imperfect. The
imperfection of the oscillator can be represented by the fact that the oscillator does not keep time according to ECI
coordinate time. The oscillator will then have a running phase given by

ψosc(t) =

where the time scale t∗ is not the same as the ECI coordinate time t. I assume that at the initial time to the oscillator
has the correct time t∗ = to. If we counted the cycles of the oscillator since the initial time to, and multiplied by the
period of the oscillator, 2π/ω, then the elapsed time, according to the oscillator is t∗
to. The diﬀerence between the
real ECI coordinate time elapsed, t
to, is

∆t∗, where ∆t∗ is the oscillator clock bias that has accrued since the initial

given by (t
time. So the time kept by the oscillator, t∗ and the coordinate time, t, are related by

Equation (44) gives the diﬀerence of the accrued phase changes in the oscillator and in the voltage of the receiver
(due to signal of satellite s). This is the quantity that is measured by satellite tracking receivers and is known as a
measurement of carrier phase or accumulated delta-range. Equation (44), together with the above deﬁnitions, deﬁnes
an algorithm for single-antenna determination of position, time, and attitude by satellite navigation.

The measured phase change given by Eq. (44) depends on seven unknown parameters and several assumed-known

parameters:

∆Ψs(xk

o, ∆t

∗

, α, β, γ; xk

s , R1k, R2k, αo, βoγo)

(45)

The unknown parameters at time t are the receiver antenna position, xk
o, k = 1, 2, 3, receiver oscillator phase correction
ω∆t∗ (or equivalently, the receiver clock bias ∆t∗), and the three Euler angles, α, β, γ, which deﬁne the attitude
matrix of the receiver antenna. The parameters that are assumed known functions of time are the satellite position
coordinates or satellite ephemeris, xk
s , k = 1, 2, 3, and the satellite attitude parameters R1k, R2k, k = 1, 2, 3. I will
collectively refer to xk
s , R1k and R2k, as the satellite enhanced ephemeris. In addition, the receiver attitude at the
initial time to must be known through, for example, the Euler angles αo, βo, and γo.

There are several modes in which a user may exploit the general single antenna attitude determination algorithm
described above. The choice of mode depends on other systems that are available to the user, and what information
the user requires. Perhaps the most basic assumption is that the user has no additional systems for navigation. In
this case, the user receiver determines the needed parameters at the initial time to, as well as the satellite enhanced
ephemeris, and then tracks the carrier phase continuously of seven satellites. At a given time t, the seven equations
, 7, are a closed system of equations that can be solved for the seven parameters of receiver
in Eq. (44), for s = 1,
o, k = 1, 2, 3, receiver clock bias ∆t∗, and the complete three-axis attitude given by the three Euler angles
position, xk
α, β, and γ. The requirement that the user’s receiver track seven satellites is not as severe as it may seem, because,
for example, in the case of GPS, there are plans to provide additional satellites to the number that are currently
operational.

· · ·

Another mode of navigation is to carry an oscillator that is suﬃciently stable over the intended time interval of
navigation. For example, in the case of a UAV, the time of ﬂight may be 10 minutes. An oscillator accurate to one
part in 109 would maintain a phase within

≈

If the oscillator is accurate enough, then the parameter ∆∗t does not have to be determined, and it is suﬃcient to
track six satellites, to compute the three position coordinates and the three Euler angles of attitude.

Still another mode of navigation is to provide the user with compass heading information. The ability to determine
three axis attitude allows the extraction of the compass heading associated with a particular axis of the receiver
platform. This requires a trivial transformation from ECI coordinates and time to topocentric coordinates.

VI. SUMMARY

Current technology of attitude determination by satellite navigation requires the use of multiple, well-separated
antennas. In this paper, I have described the theory and the algorithm for determining the position, time and three
angles of attitude (antenna orientation), when tracking the carrier phase of seven satellites using a single antenna.
The method is based on the phase change induced in the open circuit voltage in an antenna due to the signal of a
satellite that is transmitting from a known location and having a known orientation. The dependence of the phase
shift on receiving antenna orientation is given in Eq. (32).

The attitude determination algorithm described here can be applied by current GPS receivers with essentially a
software addition, since these receivers routinely track the carrier phase (or delta range) of the satellites. Furthermore,
the orientation of the GPS antennas is known quite accurately because the satellite main beam is pointed toward the
center of the Earth [12].

If a higher accuracy of attitude is required, the satellite broadcast ephemeris can be enhanced to include precise
information on the satellite antenna orientations. This enhanced ephemeris could be implemented in a future version
of the GPS, or some other satellite system. Such an architecture would make the satellite system capable of providing
a user with time, position, and orientation.

For user applications, a single-antenna (rather than multiple-antenna ) attitude determination system is preferable
because it allows miniaturization of the receiver system and is potentially less expensive to manufacture and to
install. An example where single-antenna attitude determination is preferable is in micro air vehicles (MAV), nano
satellites [13] and in general aviation aircraft. Currently, the U.S. ﬂeet of aircraft is transitioning from ground-
based navigation methods to satellite-based (mostly GPS) navigation. Attitude information is needed by a pilot

8

whenever aircraft are ﬂying by reference to instruments, such as in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).
Many general-aviation aircraft already have single-antenna GPS receivers. Therefore, it may be possible to extract
attitude information, using the single-antenna attitude determination method presented here, from GPS carrier phase
tracking data in already-installed GPS receivers, with only a software change and addition of an attitude output
channel.

Information on position, time and attitude of a platform is equivalent to knowing the compass heading. Conse-
quently, another application of attitude determination is to replace the wet compass. Satellite navigation receivers
are being miniaturized and put into a wrist watch [15]. The potential for miniaturizing the user receiver by using
the single-antenna attitude determination method may lead to production of a satellite-based compass that can be
carried by a person in a watch-sized instrument.

Finally, the algorithm presented here can be applied to GPS signal simulators, to simulate a real signal seen by a

satellite receiver that is rotating as well as translating.

[12] For the case of GPS satellites, the attitude is controlled quite precisely: the nadir pointing accuracy is 0.5 deg/sec (5σ) and
the angular rates must be less than 0.5 deg/sec or 5× 10−5 deg in 1 ms (3 σ); the yaw attitude control accuracy is better
than 3.0 deg (3σ) with respect to the sun. See the document, “System Segment Speciﬁcation for the GPS Production Space

Abstract

Measurements with low Z targets at internal experiments typically imply a gas load
which deteriorates the ring vacuum. Future experiments need reliable estimates for
the expected vacuum conditions in order to design 4π detectors closely surrounding
the interaction area.

We present a method for the calculation of the resulting vacuum of such a complex
system using a Pellet Target. In order to test the method, a vacuum system with
diagnostic tools has been set up and a Pellet Target was operated under realistic
conditions. The results for the absolute vacuum agree within factors of two with the
expected pressures.

1 Introduction

Modern storage rings need a high vacuum throughout the whole ring to main-
tain the requirements on beam precision and lifetime. Internal experiments
covering 4π acceptance have typically little space for vacuum pumps close to
the interaction point. This is, however, the region where a high gas load is
introduced if windowless Gas, Cluster, or Pellet Targets are used. When plan-
ning a new experimental facility the dimensions of the vacuum system have
to be adjusted such that an acceptable pressure is reached inside the ring. In
order to do this, it is crucial to have the means to predict the vacuum taking
the geometry and gas load by the target into account.

In this paper we present a method to calculate the vacuum in such a system
and compare it with measurements of the vacuum in a dedicated test stand.
The measurements and calculations were done using a vacuum system which
is similar to the one anticipated for the future PANDA experiment [1] and a
Pellet Target as the source of gas.

A Pellet Target consists of micro-spheres (about 30 µm in diameter) of frozen
gas called “pellets”. Typically, hydrogen, deuterium, or noble gases are used.
The pellets travel with speeds of 50 to 100 metres per second and a spread of
about 1 mrad. Thus the production can be metres away from the interaction
point. Such a target was used at the CELSIUS/WASA experiment and is
currently in operation at COSY [2,3]. A copy of the generator of this target
was set up as a testing facility at The Svedberg Laboratory (TSL), Uppsala,
Sweden. The Pellet-Test Station (PTS) has been equipped with a full vacuum
system in order to perform the measurements discussed below.

2 Experimental Set-Up

The Pellet-Test Station (PTS) is a fully operational target which has been
built to test and further develop the Pellet Target at CELSIUS/WASA. It is
a completely independent system and the pellet generator is largely a copy of
the WASA target. The details of the pellet generation can be found in Refs. [2].
The basic principle is that gas, e.g. hydrogen, is liqueﬁed in a ﬁrst stage and
small droplets are formed by vibrations with 50 to 100 kHz. These are then
injected into vacuum which causes freezing. The point of vacuum injection is
often referred to as the point of production, and we set our scale to it. To avoid
large tails of the distribution of the pellet stream and to deﬁne the width at
the interaction point, a skimmer is used at some point on the pellets’ path.
Typically rates of several thousand pellets per second are reached for a total
width of the stream of about 2 mm at an interaction point about 2 m below

2

the vacuum injection.

The PTS diﬀers by the following items from the original WASA target [2]:

•

•

•

The cold head has been improved, leading to lower vibrations, faster pump-
ing, better temperature and vacuum control.
The construction has been redesigned in order to allow for better access and
faster exchange of parts on the generator, while keeping compatibility with
the WASA system.
A new vacuum system has been added, which is designed to simulate the
interaction region of PANDA vacuum-wise. It allows vacuum measurements
at ﬁve points and visual observation of the pellets on two levels. Here cam-
eras, counters and a line-scan camera have been installed [4].

A side view of the system is sketched in Fig. 1 and important parts and their
distance to the production are listed in Table 1. The pellet-generation system
is mounted on top of a block, which contains 4 turbo-molecular pumps with
a pumping speed of 2800 l/s each. It should be noted that all the pumping
speeds given in this document refer to the respective values for hydrogen, as
this is the gas we consider here. During operation the pressure in the block is
typically 10−5 mbar.

The skimmer, a cone with a hole of 2 mm that cuts the tails of the pellet
distribution, is positioned below the Pumping Block. The upper observation
chamber holding this skimmer is used to align the pellet stream such that a
large fraction of the pellets pass through it. A side eﬀect of such a skimmer
is that some pellets are deﬂected only slightly when hitting the rim or inner
surface. These continue with the stream and may produce large gas loads,
where the system is narrow and diﬃcult to pump. In order to remove these,
a second restriction of 8 mm diameter is placed 27 cm below the skimmer. To
pump the gas away, the chamber between is equipped with a turbo-molecular
pump with 150 l/s and a vacuum gauge of Pirani type (L0).

When installing such a system at a large experimental set-up, the skimmer
would be placed much further up, e.g. in the middle of the Pumping Block. In
this case much more space would be available for detectors while leaving the
properties of the pellet stream unchanged. 2

Below this point the components which simulate the vacuum system inside a
future detector follow. It is referred to as the Central System in the following.
This corresponds also to the part which has been modelled for the calculations
discussed in Section 3. There are two feed lines and an Interaction Region. The

2 This is because the diameter of the skimmer can be changed accordingly. Studies
with several skimmer sizes have conﬁrmed the expected geometric relation without
signiﬁcant distortion.

Fig. 1. Sketch of the Pellet-Test Station (PTS). The Pellet Generator (top) ejects
pellets at the Vacuum Injection Capillary, which pass a skimmer 1.24 m below and
reach the Interaction Region about one metre further below. Finally they are col-
lected in the Dump (see also Table 1). The vacuum system resembles the situation
inside a 4π detector, where the beam would enter the Interaction Region horizon-
tally.

feed lines have a inner diameter of 6 mm close to the interaction region to sim-
ulate a typical experimental situation. Inside these lines, vacuum gauges (L1
and L3) are installed to study the vacuum gradient and systematics. At each
of the three central measurement levels (L1, L2, and L3) we have placed two
vacuum gauges: one Pirani and one Penning type. Thus a vacuum range from
atmospheric pressure down to well below 10−7 mbar is covered. The gauges
have been calibrated and all values given in the following refer to hydrogen.
The uncertainty of any vacuum measurement is estimated to be 25%.

The Interaction Region cannot be pumped eﬀectively through the narrow
pellet-feed lines. Moreover, assuming a moderate pumping speed at the region
itself, gas from the pellets is streaming into the Interaction Region rather than
being pumped away. This is because the gas load from the pellets is occurring
all along their vertical path, i.e. mostly inside the feed pipes. Both calculations
and measurements conﬁrm that, indeed, the vacuum in the Interaction Region
can be improved using thinner rather than wider feed pipes. Also a moderate
prolongation of these pipes would not lead to a signiﬁcant change of vacuum
properties.

In an experimental set-up the beam pipe would intersect in the Interaction
Region. Instead we accommodate two vacuum gauges (L2), a turbo-molecular
pump, and an observation house at this place. The pump (150 l/s) is throttled
by a conductance-limiting pipe such that theoretically a pumping speed of
47 l/s should be reached. 3 Thus we expect to reproduce the pumping speed
foreseen at PANDA. The observation house is used to observe the concentra-
0.1 mm laser and two independent counters
tion of pellets. We use a 5 mm
at this place to determine the count rate and distribution of pellets [1,4]. One
counter uses light reﬂected to angles of about 7◦, which is focused by a lens-
aperture system into a photo-multiplier. A CCD line-scan camera records light
reﬂected to 90◦. The rates recorded with both systems agree to within 10%
and we use the ﬁrst system for the following analysis.

×

The Pellet Dump is placed at the bottom. A cone reﬂects pellets to the sides
to minimise the risk of a re-entry into the feed pipe. A turbo-molecular pump
with 210 l/s pumping speed is mounted on one side and a Pirani gauge (L4)
monitors the vacuum. The system lacks an active pellet-capturing mechanism
(as e.g. active charcoal under cryogenic conditions) and therefore backﬂow
of vaporized hydrogen gas is inevitable. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded
that some bouncing pellets will ﬁnd their way back upwards into the pipe
system. If this happens, even a very small fraction will aﬀect the vacuum at
L3 signiﬁcantly.

3 Vacuum Calculations

To understand theoretically the vacuum in our system we use the following
input, which is described in greater detail below.

(1) From the knowledge of the rate, size, and temperature of the pellets their

gas load can be calculated [5].

3 In Section 3 we will see that this value is almost reached.

and 231 cm is generally referred to as the Interaction Region. The Central System
between 151 and 297 cm is modelled by the vacuum calculations.

(2) The conductances of the central system can be modeled using a one-
dimensional approach based on Kirchoﬀ-like rules for non-trivial pipe-
systems in the regime of molecular ﬂow.

(3) We have experimentally obtained the pumping speeds at three positions

of the system.

In order to determine the gas load on the system from the outgassing pellets,
item (1), we use the method in Ref. [5] where a Helmholtz equation is solved
in spherical coordinates. First we consider the mass loss per individual pellet

Here, PS is the solid-vapour saturation pressure from Ref. [6] and RH is the
speciﬁc gas constant of hydrogen. We neglect the pressure of the surrounding
vacuum P∞ as it is much smaller than PS in most cases. With this assumption
we tend to overestimate the gas load only at very high rates. The surface
area A is calculated from the pellet diameter, which was determined to be
3) µm. This is signiﬁcantly larger than during typical pellet-
on average (45
target operation due to the use of a 50% larger nozzle than at WASA. In
Ref. [5] the emissivity, which aﬀects the equilibrium temperature and mass
loss, is an unknown parameter and was set to ǫ = 0.5. In order to account for
that uncertainty, we attribute a 40% error to the mass loss.

The errors from the emissivity and the speed of the pellets dominate the total
uncertainty of 50%.

To describe eﬀectively the conductance, item (2), we limit ourselves to the rel-
atively simple central system and consider an eﬀective pumping speed for that
system for the ﬁnal analysis. A one-dimensional model based on Kirchoﬀ-like
rules can be used to describe a vacuum system with pipes of known conduc-
tance. For a pipe of circular cross section of diameter d the conductance is
calculated using the method from Ref. [7], in which a characteristic conduc-
tance of an element is Cchar = Capa , where Cap = 0.347 d2 l/(s mm2) refers
to the aperture and for hydrogen gas at 298 K. The transmission probability
a for a given pipe length l has two extreme cases: in the limit when l
d
d (long pipe),
(aperture) a equals 1, and for the other extreme case, when l
the probability is 4d/3l. Both limits, as well as intermediate cases, are well
described by the general-case probability

We use this approach and VAKLOOP [8] to model our central system between
the 8 mm Restriction and the end of feed pipe in the Dump, i.e. between 151 cm
and 297 cm from the Production Point (see shaded area in Figure 1). For the
calculation we assign three eﬀective pumping speeds to the system, one at
each end (S1 and S3), and one at 213 cm (S2), where we have our throttled
pump simulating the interaction region of PANDA.

To obtain these eﬀective pumping speeds, item (3), we have used the system
itself and injected a known amount of gas. A thermal mass ﬂow meter (V¨ogtlin,
2–100 mln/min) calibrated for hydrogen was used. The error of 16% given by
the manufacturer is shown as a band in Figure 2. The procedure has been
performed for two gas loads and at three diﬀerent positions (L1, L2, and
L3 levels). Thus 18 experimental points for the vacuum have been obtained,
which were used in a single iterative approach with the three pumping speeds
as parameters (see Figure 2).

Though the absolute pressures vary by more than three orders of magnitude,
the values are described well within two σ of the errors. The set of eﬀective
pumping speeds that reproduce the experimental observations in Figure 2 was
found to be S1 = 10 l/s, S2 = 37 l/s, and S3 = 30 l/s. From the geometry alone

Fig. 2. Measured vacuum (red points with error bars) when known ﬂows of hydrogen
gas are injected at three diﬀerent locations indicated by the upward arrows in the
panels. The green shaded area shows an approach which only uses the three eﬀective
pumping speeds (S1, S2, and S3) as free parameters (see text). The locations where
those speeds are introduced are indicated at the top of the Figure. The widths of
the curves represent only the errors from the uncertainty of the gas input. The
errors of the points correspond to an assumed uncertainty of 25% for the vacuum
measurements.

it is diﬃcult to calculate the pumping speeds for S1 and S3, because the system
is complicated and the pumps are perpendicular to the openings. Using a
signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed geometry, values are obtained which are factors 5 and 3
higher than obtained from the ﬁt, respectively. The S2 value can be calculated
with much less ambiguity as the geometry is rather simple. It is also the crucial
value for the vacuum measurements described in the following section. The
resulting value of Scalc = 47 l/s agrees within 20% with the result of S2 =
37 l/s from the measurements. This shows that the calculations have to be
restricted to geometrically rather simple arrangements. We use the measured
(S1, S2, S3) = (10, 37, 30) l/s as respective pumping speeds at the three levels

8

in the following. The uncertainty for these values is discussed in the next
section.

4 Results of the Vacuum Measurements

The vacuum measurements were performed with the set-up described in Sec-
tion 2, where we assign a 25% error to the vacuum measurements. We used
the pellet counter with the photo-multiplier tube to measure the pellet rate.
Here we have to assume an error of about 20%. We scanned a range from a
few hundred to almost 5000 pellets per second while observing the pressure
at all gauges. The pressure follows a linear relation at all levels, as expected
(see linear ﬁt in Figure 3).

Fig. 3. Measured vacuum as a function of pellet rate at the Interaction Chamber L2
(red points with error bars). The errors for the pellet rate are 20% and not shown
in order not to overcrowd the plot. The red thin dashed line is a linear ﬁt to the
data. The green line and shaded area show the vacuum expected from calculations
and the error to this calculation, respectively.

At the Interaction Region (L2 gauge) the pressure increases to a few times
10−4 mbar when pellet rates of 4000/sec are reached (see points with error
bars in Figure 3). As already shown the gas load from the pellets is propor-
tional to their surface and thus quadratically increasing with pellet size. As
the pellets were 50% larger than at typical pellet target operation, we would
expect the vacuum to always stay below 10−4 mbar with “normal” sized pel-
lets. Nevertheless, this clearly shows that the gas load is of concern if only

9

low pumping speeds, as foreseen at PANDA, can be reached at the interaction
point.

The solid and dotted lines in Figure 3 show the calculated vacuum for the cor-
responding rate and their uncertainty, respectively. The calculation has been
done as described in Section 3 considering the errors for the mass loss and
speed of the pellets. Note that the uncertainty in pellet rate of 20% is not
shown in the ﬁgure. The calculations agree within two σ but systematically
underestimate the pressures reached. For L1 the values agree within errors,
while close to the dump at L3 the calculations fail to describe the measured
pressure. These eﬀects can be explained by a contamination from bouncing
pellets, that add to the gas load. In the Interaction chamber this is less likely.
Thus we conclude that systematic errors may be slightly larger than antici-
pated. This may be attributed to the uncertainties from the pumping speeds,
which were not taken into account. A 30% overestimation of the pumping
speeds determined by the method in Section 3 would be suﬃcient to reach full
agreement within errors.

5 Conclusions

We have reported on the gas load that is expected when pellets are used as an
internal target. We have presented a method to calculate the vacuum when
such a target is operated. In order to check the results of these calculations,
measurements of the vacuum under realistic conditions were performed at the
Pellet-Test Station. The set-up was equipped with a dedicated system, which
was calibrated in terms of pumping speed. The observed vacuum shows what
has to be expected at a future experiment with low pumping speed at the
interaction point. The results of the calculations seem to lie systematically
too low, but are within factors of two in agreement with the experiment.

In conclusion, a vacuum of about 10−4 mbar has to be expected when operating
a pellet target with only 40 l/s pumping speed at the interaction point. The
model describes the vacuum resulting from the operation of a pellet target
in a complex system within factors of two. This is especially remarkable as
absolute values are calculated and the measurements cover more than one
order in magnitude in vacuum and count rate. Thus we expect that the vacuum
for other conﬁgurations may be predicted using that method within similar
accuracy. This may be a very useful tool for the design of the vacuum systems
of future experiments, like PANDA.

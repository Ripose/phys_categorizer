The use of a nonhomogeneous aerogel radiator, i.e. one consisting of layers with diﬀerent refractive indices, has
been shown to improve the resolution of the Cherenkov angle measured with a proximity focusing RICH detector.
In order to obtain further information on the performance of such a detector, a simple model has been used to
calculate the resolution and search for optimal radiator parameters.

1. Introduction

As part of the upgrade of the Belle detector
at KEK, it is planned to install a ring imaging
Cherenkov detector in the forward region of the
spectrometer to improve separation of pions and
kaons in the momentum range up to 4 GeV/c.
The limited available space has led to the deci-
sion for a proximity focusing detector using aero-
gel as radiator (1). Diﬀerent aerogel radiators (2)
as well as diﬀerent position sensitive photon de-
tectors (3; 4) have been investigated to ﬁnd an
optimal solution.

An idea to further improve the resolution, has
recently been proposed and experimentally stud-
ied (5; 6), and was later also discussed in (7).
By using a nonhomogeneous radiator, i.e. multi-
ple aerogel layers of varying refractive index, one
may increase the number of detected photons per
per charged particle, but avoid the simultaneous
increase in emission point uncertainty that would
follow from an increase in the thickness of a ho-
mogeneous radiator. This is achieved by suitably
choosing the refractive indices of the consecutive
layers, so that the corresponding Cherenkov rings
either overlap on the photon detector (focusing
conﬁguration) or they are well separated (defo-

cusing conﬁguration). Various conﬁgurations of
aerogel radiators have been experimentally inves-
tigated and have shown the expected improve-
ment in resolution (6).

In order to achieve optimal performance of the
detector in the focusing conﬁguration, we have
studied the inﬂuence of various radiator param-
eters, such as diﬀerence in refractive index be-
tween the layers, their thickness and transmission
length, on the resolution of the Cherenkov angle
measured for a charged particle of given momen-
tum. Using a simple model to calculate this res-
olution, we have attempted to ﬁnd a set of ra-
diator parameters that would produce the best
results, i.e. the lowest standard deviation of the
measured Cherenkov angle due to monoenergetic
pions or kaons.

2. The model

The detector (Fig. 1) has a double layer aerogel
radiator of total thickness D0, with the thickness
of the downstream radiator layer (labeled 2 in
Fig. 1) given as k2D0. Refractive indices n1 and
n2 = n1 + δn2 correspond to Cherenkov angles
Θ1 and Θ2. The photon detector, at a distance
L from the entry surface of the upstream radia-
tor, has square photosensitive pixels with the side
equal to ∆.

For a charged particle passing through the two-
layer radiator, in general two rings are seen at the
plane of the photon detector. We assume that the
distribution of Cherenkov photons in each ring is
uniform in the distance R from the ring center
(Fig. 2). This approximation is good for normal
incidence and high transmission lengths of both
radiator layers. The two uniform distributions
contain N1 and N2 detected photons. The num-
bers of detected photons are assumed to be:

N1 = N0D1 sin2 Θ1 exp(

N2 = N0D2 sin2 Θ2 exp(

where D2 = k2D0, D1 = (1
k2)D0 and Λ1, Λ2
are the transmission lengths2 of both aerogel lay-
ers. For N0, the ﬁgure of merit of Cherenkov
counters, we assume a value of 50/cm, which was
a typical value from experimental tests of such a
conﬁguration (3).

It may be quickly seen that the rms of the dis-
tribution of photons from both layers (Fig. 2) is
given by:

Other contributions, such as uncertainty of track

as σrest. Assuming that the contributions are not
correlated, we add them in quadrature and divide
by the square root of the number of detected pho-
tons to obtain the rms of the Cherenkov angle for
a track, i.e. the parameter that needs to be min-
imized, as

The optimization procedure described below
refers mainly to the parameters of the aerogel
radiator layers such as refractive index, thick-
ness and transmission length. Other parameters,
which are determined by our given experimen-
tal arrangement, are mainly ﬁxed at values corre-
sponding to the particular detector under study.
For example, the radiator-to-photon-detector dis-
tance is 20 cm, the photon detector pixel size
is set to 6 mm and the contribution from other
sources is found to be σrest = 6 mrad.

3. Results

3.1. Double layer radiator

−

First we have checked the equations and the
calculation by taking both radiator layers of equal
refractive index (δn2 = n2
n1 = 0). The re-
fractive index was set to n = 1.04, which corre-
sponds to a Cherenkov angle of Θ = Θ1 = Θ2 =
278 mrad for 4 GeV/c pions. The transmission
length was assumed to be Λ = Λ1 = Λ2 = 4 cm.
The photon detector, at a distance of L = 20 cm
from the entry surface of the radiator, has a
ﬁxed pad size ∆ = 6 mm. As suggested by

3

our measurements (3; 8), the contribution from
other, not yet completely understood sources, is
σrest = 6 mrad. The track resolution, given by
σtrack, was then calculated as a function of the
total radiator thickness D0. The result, shown
in Fig. 3, gives an optimal total thickness of
about 2 cm, at which the resolution amounts to
σtrack = 5.4 mrad. This is also consistent with
the experimental value obtained from our mea-
surements (3).

versus the thickness D0 of a homogeneous radi-
ator with n = 1.04 (Θ = 278 mrad), Λ = 4 cm,
L = 20 cm, ∆ = 6 mm and σrest = 6 mrad.

In the next step, the diﬀerence δn2 in refractive
indices of the two radiators has been varied for
the case of n1 = 1.04 (Θ1 = 278 mrad) and two
equally thick radiators (D0 = 4 cm, k2 = 0.5),
with attenuation lengths Λ1 = Λ2 = 4 cm, ﬁxed
distance L = 20 cm, standard pad size of 6 mm
and σrest = 6 mrad. The minimum of σtrack was
found to be about 4.3 mrad at a diﬀerence in
refractive indices of 0.009, which corresponds to
Θ1 =
a diﬀerence in Cherenkov angle of Θ2
29 mrad (Fig. 4). We note that the minimum in
σtrack is quite broad, a departure of δn2 by
0.002
from the optimal value only increases σtrack by
about 0.1 mrad.

other parameters left unchanged, the relative
thickness of aerogel 2 was varied. The minimum
is at k2 = 0.44 as may be seen in Fig. 5. We ob-
serve that the variation of σtrack with k2 is weak:
it stays within 3% of the minimum value over a
broad interval 0.35 < k2 < 0.55.

A plot of σtrack depending on both relative
thickness k2 and diﬀerence of refractive indices
δn2, gives a minimum of 4.2 mrad at δn2 = 0.009
and k2 = 0.44 (Fig. 6). If, in addition to δn2 and
k2, also the total radiator thickness D0 is varied,
σtrack has the same minimal value (4.2 mrad) at
the thickness of D0 = 3.2 cm.

parameters are: n1 = 1.04, D0 = 4 cm, Λ = 4 cm,
L = 20 cm,∆ = 6 mm and σrest = 6 mrad.

Table 1 shows the optimized parameters for dif-
ferent values of the transmission length. It is seen
that aerogels with good transmission may con-
siderably improve the resolution. Table 2 gives
the optimized parameters for the case that 5 cm
more space is available between radiator and pho-
ton detector. The beneﬁcial eﬀect of these 5 cm
of additional space is comparable to the eﬀect of
perfect transmission.

space between radiator and photon detector (L =
20 cm), for given transmission length (Λ = 4 cm)
and pixel size (∆ = 6 mm) and for the given
contribution of other sources to σtrack (σrest =
6 mrad), one may achieve an improvement in res-
olution of about 1.2 mrad (i.e.
from 5.4 mrad
to 4.2 mrad) by optimizing the thicknesses and
refractive indices of two consecutive aerogel lay-
ers. We note that a similar improvement was also
observed in experimental tests of such a counter
(6). Further improvements may be achieved with
aerogels of better transmission or with additional
space available for the detector.

3.2. Multiple layer radiator

The calculation has been extended to the case
when the radiator consists of more than two lay-
ers. Table 3 shows the optimized parameters for
3 and 4 layers compared to the dual radiator. It
is evident that the improvement of resolution is
primarily due to an increased radiator thickness,
and consequently to the measured number of pho-
tons per track, while the single photon resolution
σ0 remains approximately constant.

A simple estimate of σtrack may be obtained
just by dividing the contribution due to emission
point uncertainty by the number of layers and
adding the other (ﬁxed) contributions in quadra-
ture. The curves in Fig. 7 are obtained by such
a simpliﬁed procedure. It is seen that the results
of optimization using the model described in sec-
tion 2. of this paper and represented by points
in Fig. 7, agree quite nicely with such a simple
estimate. From Fig. 7 we also see that an in-
creased number of layers leads to an increase in
optimal overall radiator thickness. For this sim-
pliﬁed model we plot in Fig. 8 the track resolu-
tion σtrack at the optimized radiator thickness as
a function of the number of layers.

We observe that the dependence of σtrack on
radiator thickness at the minimum is relatively
weak.
It is also not symmetric with respect to
the minimum, i.e. an increase in overall thickness
produces a smaller change in σtrack than an equal
decrease (Fig. 3 and Fig. 7). It would therefore
be advisable to use a thickness, which at higher
charged particle momenta is somewhat greater
than the value required to minimize σtrack. This

in the 1-4 GeV/c momentum range.

would produce a negligible loss of resolution at
high momenta, but would represent a valuable
increase in the number of detected photons at
low momenta, where the diﬀerence in Cherenkov
angle between pions and kaons is large any-
way (or where kaons are below the threshold for
Cherenkov radiation). This low sensitivity on the
thickness of individual radiator layers (Fig. 5) also
has a practical advantage; it permits equal thick-
nesses of the diﬀerent layers, thus simplifying the
production process.

Finally we note that the quantity we are actu-
ally interested in is the separation between pi-
ons and kaons at a given momentum, sπK =
( ¯Θπ
¯ΘK)/σtrack. Since in addition to σtrack also
the average Cherenkov angle ¯Θ varies with ki, ni
and D0, these parameters assume diﬀerent values
if sπK is optimized instead of σtrack. The total ra-
diator thickness is, e.g. somewhat smaller if sπK
is maximized (D0 = 3.0 cm, 3.7 cm and 4.3 cm
for the two, three and four layer conﬁguration,
respectively). It turns out, however, that the re-
sulting σtrack and sπK are almost equal in both
cases.

4. Conclusion

We have shown that with a nonhomoge-
neous aerogel radiator in a proximity focusing
Cherenkov ring imaging detector, one may, by
adjusting the refractive index of consecutive ra-
diator layers, reduce the contribution of emission
point uncertainty to the overall Cherenkov an-
gle resolution of a charged particle track. In the
particular case of the RICH detector studied for
the Belle upgrade, the limiting factors are then
the lack of space and the pixel size. We have
also seen that the optimal resolution is not very
sensitive to minor variations of refractive index
or thickness of individual aerogel layers. This is a
very welcome property, since it somewhat reduces
the stringent demands on the aerogel production
process.

In our previous experimental studies, we have
seen that there also exists an important contri-
bution (σrest) from factors not yet understood.
These will be the subject of further study, as well
as the investigation into possibilities of improv-

Abstract

LXeGRIT – Liquid Xenon Gamma-Ray Imaging Telescope – is the ﬁrst prototype
of a Compton telescope for MeV γ-ray astrophysics based on a LXe time projec-
tion chamber. One of the most relevant ﬁgures of merit for a Compton telescope
is the detection eﬃciency for γ-rays, which depends on diverse contributions such
as detector geometry and passive materials, trigger eﬃciency, dead time, etc. A de-
tailed study of the eﬃciency of the LXeGRIT instrument, based both on laboratory
measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, is presented in this paper.

1 Introduction

The concept of Compton telescope (CT) has proved the most successful so far
in imaging astrophysical γ-ray sources in the energy band 1-30 MeV [1]. In
a classical CT, without electron tracking, the initial direction of the γ-ray is
determined to within a circle of angular radius ¯ϕ around the direction of the
scattered γ-ray, given by the spatial coordinates (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2),
the subscripts 1 and 2 indicating the ﬁrst and second interaction of the γ-ray.
The scatter angle ¯ϕ is given by an energy measurement, through the Compton
formula for photons on free electrons

γ is the energy of the scattered γ-ray, Eγ the initial energy of the γ-
ray, mec2 the mass of the electron (0.511 MeV). Any detector able to measure
E1) for each γ-ray with suﬃcient
(x1, y1, z1, E1) and (x2, y2, z2, Eγ −
precision is a CT. The correct sequence of the two interactions must also be
known.

∼

COMPTEL [2] on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) has been
the most successful CT to date. COMPTEL was a double-scatter CT with
a liquid scintillator detector as γ-ray converter and a NaI calorimeter. The
two detectors were separated by a distance of 1.5 m to allow a measurement
of the scatter direction with an accuracy of few degrees. In laboratory cali-
20 cm2 or less, out of a
bration, COMPTEL obtained an eﬀective area of
geometrical area of the upper detector of 4188 cm2, therefore with an eﬃ-
ciency well below 1%. The sequencing of Compton interactions was based on
the time of ﬂight measurement between the upper and lower detector. In ﬂight
the lower energy threshold for Compton imaging was 0.75 MeV, determined
by rate considerations. An approach to CT largely diﬀerent than COMPTEL
was proposed some time ago [3], using a compact homogeneous detector with
greatly enhanced position resolution (the principle is schematically shown in
Fig. 1), speciﬁcally a liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC), in
order to increase the eﬃciency and improve the background rejection capa-
bility well beyond the COMPTEL achievement. The practical realization of
this proposal has been the liquid xenon γ-ray imaging telescope (LXeGRIT)
[4,5]. It has been tested at balloon altitude four times: twice in 1997, mainly
engineering balloon ﬂights, in 1999 with a heavy γ-ray shield and in 2000 with
the un-shielded LXeTPC. The year 2000-balloon ﬂight, in particular, lasted 27
hours and provided a data sample large enough to address all the main techni-
cal issues, to give a thorough in-ﬂight calibration and to study the background
in the near space environment [6,7].

Aim of this paper is to present a detailed study of the eﬃciency of LXeGRIT to
MeV γ-rays, based both on experimental data and Monte Carlo (MC) simula-
tions. The focus will be on data taken just prior to the 2000 ﬂight. The overall
detection eﬃciency results from the combination of several contributions: de-
tector geometry and passive materials, trigger eﬃciency, dead time and limited
speed of the data acquisition system, on-line and oﬀ-line selections. These dif-
ferent contributions will be analyzed separately. LXeGRIT will be dealt with
as an imaging calorimeter but we will stop short of discussing the key issue of
imaging MeV γ-ray sources, too vast a subject to be included in the present
work (see, e.g., [7]–Ch. 4). The paper is organized as follows:

a. experimental measurements of the trigger eﬃciency, given in Sec. 2;
b. MC simulation of LXeGRIT, in Sec. 3;
c.

the full data/MC comparison, given in Sec. 4.

this example the γ-ray Compton-scatters twice before being photo-absorbed; the
separation between successive interactions in liquid Xe is typically few cm. Energy
and position are measured for each interaction, therefore providing (x1, y1, z1, E1)
and (x2, y2, z2, Eγ
E1). As in a classical Compton telescope, the scatter angle
¯ϕ is then determined from the Compton formula (eqn. 1) and the position of the
γ-ray source is constrained within a Compton circle of angular radius ¯ϕ around the
direction of the scattered γ-ray, as determined by the two points (x1, y1, z1) and
(x2, y2, z2).

LXeGRIT Trigger Eﬃciency Measurement

The LXeGRIT TPC is a position sensitive liquid ionization chamber self-
triggered by the fast xenon scintillation. When a γ-ray interacts in the ﬁducial
volume, both scintillation light and ionization charge are produced eﬃciently,
with W-values of Wph = 24 eV [8] and We = 15.6 eV [9]. The VUV photons
(178 nm) are detected by four photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), which provide
the event trigger and the initial time, t0. The ionization electrons drift under
an external electric ﬁeld, inducing a signal on two parallel wire planes, screened
by a Fritsch grid. There are 62 wires in each plane and the pitch of the wires
is 3 mm. The location of the hit wire(s) in the two wire planes provide the
x and y coordinates in the TPC reference frame, while the time, measured
starting from t0, gives the interaction depth (z coordinate). The wires do
not collect the charge, which is ﬁnally collected by one of four independent
anodes, and the amplitude measures the energy deposited in the interaction.
Once the event has been built by the data acquisition system (DAQ), on-line
selections are applied to the signals from the wires and the anodes. If not

3

rejected, the raw event, i.e. anode and wire digitized waveforms, is written
to disk. A detailed description of the LXeTPC and its working principle is
given in [7,5]; a schematic diagram of the LXeTPC showing the principle of
operation, readout structure and expected pulse shapes is given in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Schematic of the LXeTPC readout structure (not to scale) with correspond-
ing light trigger and charge pulse shapes. Adapted from [5].

The event trigger works on two diﬀerent levels: a ﬁrst level trigger (FLT)
which requires a signal from the PMTs and a second level trigger (SLT) which
performs further selections based on the anode/wire signature. The intercon-
nections of the LXeGRIT trigger system and readout electronics are shown
schematically in Fig. 3.

2.1

First Level Trigger

The FLT is provided by the logical OR of the four PMTs (Electron Tubes
9813QA). These 2-inch-diameter tubes, with a quantum eﬃciency of about
15% at 178 nm, see the LXe volume through four 2.4 inch diameter quartz
windows with good transparency in the UV (88% at normal incidence). The
bottom of the ﬁducial volume and the quartz windows are separated by a
3 cm thick layer of LXe plus the collection region, about 1 cm thick. This
large separation reduces the solid angle for events in the ﬁducial volume, and
consequently the light yield. Additional light losses are due to total reﬂection
at the window/PMT interface. Several photoelectrons are expected for every
MeV of energy deposited in the ﬁducial volume [11]. The FLT, while allowing
µs) decision, is unable to select speciﬁc event categories of interest for
a fast (
Compton imaging. The 1999 balloon ﬂight [12,7] clearly demonstrated that,

∼

when the energy spectrum of the incident γ-rays is soft, as for the atmospheric
γ-ray background, described by power law with spectral index 2, a high FLT
eﬃciency is equivalent to accept a dominant fraction of events at low energies
which are of little if any use for a CT, eventually reducing the eﬃciency for
Compton imaging. For the 2000 ﬂight, the light trigger eﬃciency was changed
to minimize the shortcomings detected during the previous ﬂight.

The eﬃciency was measured and resolved versus energy and position, following
the procedure described in [13]. The collected data fall into three classes:

A. events with an interaction detected in the ﬁducial volume (charge signal)
and a light trigger which matches the external trigger – this class is the one
contributing to the eﬃciency;

B. events with an interaction detected in the ﬁducial volume and a light trigger
which does not match the external trigger (just a chance coincidence count)
– this class introduces a background in the measurement, that has to be
accounted for;

C. events with an interaction detected in the ﬁducial volume and without a

light trigger – this class gives the ineﬃciency.

5

The eﬃciency is measured as the number of events in class A divided by the
total number of events subtracted class B. The measurement described in
[13] used a 22Na source, which emits three photons at the same time, one at
1.275 MeV and two at 0.511 MeV which are emitted back-to-back, so that
one of the two 0.511 MeV photons could be used to tag the source. The
spatial correlation of the two photons allowed a low contamination due to
chance-coincidences. While this allowed a detailed measurement of the spatial
dependency of the trigger eﬃciency for the 1999 balloon ﬂight settings, the
energy range of that measurement was limited up to 0.511 MeV, rather low
for a detector designed to work up to 10 MeV. A similar measurement was
repeated for the 2000 settings using an 88Y source, which emits simultaneously
two photons at 0.898 and 1.836 MeV with little angular correlation, and, sep-
arately, a 22Na source. The sources were loosely tagged detecting one of the
photons from the decay with a NaI(Tl) counter. Given a source rate of several
kHz and a low tagging eﬃciency, the level of contamination due to chance co-
incidence counts was high, and, combined with the low eﬃciency in the 2000
settings, more events ended up in class B rather than in class A. Nonetheless,
the fraction of events in class B is independently determined and the ﬁnal
result is then corrected for with good accuracy. In fact, the z (drift time) dis-
tribution for events triggered by random coincidence has no physical meaning
and extends above the nominal cathode position (7 cm), which delimitates the
TPC active volume. This is visible in Fig. 4 where the z distribution drops
sharply at z = 7 cm. The shape of the z distribution for events in class B
was determined through data where a random trigger was fed in as FLT. It
did show no appreciable dependence on z, so that the fraction of background
events was read out from the z distribution itself. The eﬃciency of the FLT
is in this way measured for energies up to about 2 MeV. The eﬃciency was
resolved in a four dimensional data space – energy, x, y, z – as made possible
by the imaging capability of the TPC. Since each event has to be spatially
resolved and, at the same time, the four PMTs see the total energy deposited
in the ﬁducial volume, the analysis was limited to 1-site events, for which a
univocal association between total energy loss and position is given. The ef-
ﬁciency in the 4D space was described factoring out the energy dependence,
i.e.

ǫ(E, x, y, z) = ǫ1(E)

w(x, y, z).

×

where w is a position dependent weighting factor. The dependence of the eﬃ-
ciency on the deposited energy is shown in Fig. 5 for the four PMTs combined,
using data from both 22Na and 88Y sources. A PMT mostly detects interac-
tions happening within its own quadrant and very few events are detected
by more than one PMT at the same time, because of the strong solid angle
eﬀect on light collection. The response of each PMT is measured and param-
eterized individually and the energy dependence is described analytically. For
use in MonteCarlo simulations, the spatial dependence was parameterized in
a lookup table with a granularity of 1.17 cm in z and 1.8 cm in x and y (6

×

11 bins in the x

y plane). The dependence on z is shown
z slices times 11
in Fig. 4 for one PMT. As expected, the eﬃciency decreases with increasing
distance from the PMT’s location (z = -4 cm). The energy spectrum is the
one in Fig. 5; selecting energy deposits larger than 1 MeV the overall eﬃciency
is greatly increased. An example of x
y eﬃciency map for the light trigger
−
is shown in Fig. 6, as measured using a tagged 88Y source, integrated over
all energies. The four panels correspond to four diﬀerent z slices, going from
the bottom of the ﬁducial volume (upper-left) to the top (bottom-right), i.e.
moving farther away from the PMTs. The impact of solid angle is apparent,
and closer to the PMTs the overall eﬃciency is higher and less uniform. At lo-
cations corresponding to the four PMTs below the wire structure an enhanced
eﬃciency is clearly visible.

Second Level Trigger

The SLT is provided by on-line selections based on the wire and anode signals:

i. the event is built (see Sec. 2.3) and the number of threshold-crossings on
the x and y wires (wire hits) is checked to be greater than a predeﬁned
minimum and less than a predeﬁned maximum. This step requires little
readout time, since each channel is 1 byte only. It is also sensitive to speciﬁc
event multiplicities, relevant for a CT since Compton imaging requires at
least two interactions;

ii. the amplitude of the anode waveform is checked against a given threshold.
Imposing a threshold on the anode waveform is very eﬀective in rejecting low

energy events which are useless for a CT, but, for LXeGRIT electronics, it
requires to readout the digitized waveforms and the slowness of this process
greatly reduces the usefulness of this on-line selection.

The SLT has proven to be a powerful tool, although critically dependent on
the noise level of the wires, and requiring careful monitoring. The impact of
the SLT was veriﬁed for each experiment by applying a posteriori the on-line
selections to a sample of data acquired with full digitization of all wires. The
outcome of one of these routine checks is shown in Figs. 7, 8 for data taken with
an 88Y source placed a few meters away from the TPC. The minimum number
of wire hits required both in the x and in the y wire plane was 6, the maximum
16. Each interaction usually gives 1 or 2 hits, depending on the energy deposit
and the threshold of the speciﬁc wire. The maximum has no impact on γ-events
and mainly ﬁlters out relativistic charged particles crossing the chamber and
giving many hits at the same time. Ideally a minimum of 6 wire hits would
select only events with 3 or more interactions, but in a situation with non-
negligible electronic noise a certain fraction of 1-site events is accepted (see
Fig. 8). Moreover, the fraction of accepted events depends on energy, since
an interaction with large energy is more likely to be detected over noise. For
80% above 1 MeV,
events with multiplicity 3 or higher the SLT eﬃciency is
where most of these events are. The main goal of this SLT ﬁlter is therefore to
reject low energy (below 0.5 MeV) 1-site events, especially important when the
γ-ray ﬂux has a soft spectrum. This simple procedure just counts the number
of wire hits and does not exploit the 3D imaging capability of the TPC. When
data are analyzed oﬀ-line, the x, y and z coordinates are matched and the
contamination due to noisy events is reduced to a truly negligible level [14].

2.3 Data acquisition

The DAQ system developed for the 2000 ﬂight of LXeGRIT is described in [10].
The total throughput of the system is limited to about 1.6 MB/s, restricting
the event building rate to 40-50 events/s when data are taken in a mode that
reads all information from anodes and wires, providing a full image of the
chamber (in this case the event size is about 30 kB). The more usual data-
taking mode transfers only wire waveforms which crossed preset thresholds
together with the four anode waveforms and the maximum rate of built events
increases to 200-400 Hz, the actual value heavily depending on the selection
parameters and the speciﬁc source. In ﬂight conditions and for typical settings
the average event size is

5.5 kB.

18.6

7 cm3 (2.4 l) is
The LXeGRIT TPC, with an active volume of a 18.6
housed inside a stainless steel cylindrical vessel, with a diameter of 35 cm and
11.5 cm high, with an internal volume of about 10 l. The walls of the vessel are
3 mm thick, and the top ﬂange is 10 mm thick, thinned to 5 mm in the area
covering the TPC. Between the bottom of the active volume and the bottom
ﬂange there is a gap of 3.6 cm, ﬁlled with passive LXe. To reduce passive LXe
around the TPC electrodes structure, stainless steel spacers are used on three
sides (the fourth one housing the HV feedthrough). Thermal insulation of the
cold vessel is provided by a vacuum cryostat. The lower section of the cryostat
encloses the four PMTs with their HV divider circuits and the electronics
boards used to decouple the HV bias to the wires from the signal coupling
boards. The cryostat, also made out of stainless steel, has a cylindrical shape
with 3 mm thick walls while and a 7 mm thick top ﬂange, thinned to 5 mm
above the sensitive area. The diameter of the vacuum cryostat is 47.6 cm and
the height is 36.1 cm. The total mass, including LXe, is about 190 kg.

A picture of the LXeGRIT payload in 2000 ﬂight’s gondola conﬁguration, is
shown in Fig. 9-lef t. The various components of the equipment are rather
evenly distributed and the most abundant material is by far aluminum. In-
cluding the gondola in the MC mass model is necessary when a large fraction
of the γ-ray ﬂux comes from below the LXeTPC, as it is the case for the at-
mospheric γ-ray ﬂux [6]. The gondola is modelled as a truncated cone, 102 cm
high with a diameter of 183 cm at the bottom and a diameter of 122 cm
at the top(see Fig. 9-right). A simpliﬁed mass model has been implemented,
using parallel “disks and donuts” at four diﬀerent locations in z. Its main
features are shown in Fig. 9-right. The accuracy of this model is expected to
be adequate when the γ-ray ﬂux is azimuthally symmetric, or any azimuthal
dependence is washed out by the spinning of the instrument around the z axis.

MC studies of the performance of the LXeGRIT instrument have been based
on the GEANT 3.21 detector simulation package [15]. Diﬀerent γ-ray sources
(from internal background to point-like monochromatic sources to diﬀuse
sources with power law spectra) have been encoded in the simulation and are
selectable through an input card ﬁle. For each interaction of a γ-ray tracked
through the mass model, x, y, z, energy deposit and interaction type are
recorded; secondary Bremsstrahlung photons are tagged as such, regardless of
their speciﬁc interaction mechanism. For each photon which deposits at least
10 keV in the ﬁducial volume, an entry is created in the output ﬁle. Up to this
point, only the mass model of the detector and the physics of γ-ray interaction
are accounted for. The other main eﬀects are then introduced in this order:
ﬁrst, treatment of the charge signal; second, treatment of the light signal.

The response of the TPC to a charge signal is parameterized in terms of
minimum energy threshold and minimum spatial separation required to resolve
two close-by interactions. Based on extensive comparisons of experimental and
MC generated data ([7]–Ch. 2 and 3), the minimum separation in the x and
y coordinates is described by a normal distribution with mean value 5 mm,
3 mm RMS and a sharp minimum of 4 mm; for the z coordinate a normal
distribution with mean value 4 mm, 1 mm RMS and a sharp minimum of
z and
3 mm is used. A pair of interactions must be resolved both in the x
z planes, but can be confused in z or x or y. If this condition is not
y
fulﬁlled the two interactions are clustered. The minimum energy threshold
follows a normal distribution with mean value 150 keV, 40 keV RMS and a
sharp minimum of 40 keV. This energy threshold is applied to each single
interaction (after clustering) and not to the total energy loss in the ﬁducial
volume. The minimum energy threshold and minimum separation match the
performance of the TPC wire readout. The deposited energy is then smeared
according to the measured energy resolution for the anode signals, ∆E/E =
10−3(FWHM), where E is the energy is MeV ([7]–
√6.7
Ch. 3). This model mainly describes the wire response, which sets an energy
threshold higher than the anode threshold, together with providing a ﬁner
spatial resolution. Only the energy resolution is determined by the ﬁtted anode
signal.

The eﬃciency of the light trigger is applied to the MC data, where each event is
described as a sequence of localized energy deposits (Ei, xi, yi, zi), i = 1, ..., n,
with n the event multiplicity. The lookup tables described in Sec. 2.1 give the
probability to trigger the detector for each individual (Ei, xi, yi, zi). For 1-
site events this immediately gives the trigger probability for the entire event,
while for multi-site events this is calculated combining the n interactions. The
corresponding statistical weight is then assigned to each γ-ray.

The part of the detector response due to further on-line checks (SLT) is intro-
duced at this point of the data analysis, parameterized versus energy for each
multiplicity, as shown in Sec. 2.2.

Fig. 10. Interaction multiplicity for diﬀerent energies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 MeV). The
superimposed dashed histogram shows the interaction multiplicity for fully contained
events.

The interaction multiplicity for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 MeV photons, for nor-
mal incidence and with the detector response as described above, but without
including the response of the FLT and SLT, DAQ deadtime and oﬀ-line data
analysis, is shown in Fig. 10. The same curves for fully contained events are su-
perimposed. While the single site events are the most numerous at all energies,
the fully contained events are more easily found in the multi site sample for
energies exceeding 1 MeV. The interaction multiplicity is reduced compared to
the true number of interactions a γ-ray undergoes before escaping the detec-
tor or being photoabsorbed. This reduction is due both to the 150 keV energy
threshold and to the spatial confusion of closeby interactions. While the en-
ergy threshold implies a neat loss of detection eﬃciency, the eﬀect of spatial
confusion is to degrade the interaction multiplicity, even if the total energy

13

is still correctly measured. At energies above 5 MeV the detected multiplicity
may substantially exceed the number of interactions of the original photon,
due to the presence of secondary Bremsstrahlung photons.

The detection eﬃciency calculated under the assumption of negligible FLT,
SLT and oﬀ-line reconstruction ineﬃciencies is shown in Fig. 11, both for
mere spectroscopy and Compton imaging. These results set an upper limit
to the eﬃciency of the detector. As a calorimeter, eﬃciencies for diﬀerent
multiplicities can be summed up, while as a CT only eﬃciencies to double and
multi site events can be combined. As a CT, the eﬃciency is overestimated
even for negligible FLT and SLT ineﬃciencies, because multiple interactions
have to be time-sequenced before proceeding to Compton imaging.

Fig. 11. Detection eﬃciency of the LXeTPC as a function of γ-ray energy. Two
cases are considered, the calorimeter mode and the Compton telescope mode, which
requires multiplicity 2 or larger and no pair-production or Bremsstrahlung interac-
tions. The correct time sequence of interactions is assumed to be known. Experi-
mental data are in calorimeter mode for 0.898 and 1.836 MeV (88Y) and 1.275 MeV
(22Na), corrected for FLT, SLT and oﬀ-line eﬃciency, and DAQ deadtime; the de-
tails of the eﬃciency measurement are given in Sec. 4. (+, calorimeter; ♦, Compton
telescope. )

In Fig. 12 the relative eﬀective area for sources at diﬀerent angles from the
vertical (z axis, in this case) is shown, deﬁning the ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) of the
instrument. A power law spectrum with spectral index 2 was assumed, as is
the case for the Crab Nebula. The large FoV is about 100◦ opening angle
(FWHM) or 2.5 steradian. Two main parameters determine the FoV: the
aspect ratio of detector diameter to depth and the amount of passive materials
surrounding the detector. LXeGRIT has a large aspect ratio of 18.6:7, which
is the dominant contributor to the decline in eﬀective area with zenith angle.
This geometrical eﬀect is energy-independent. Absorption in passive materials,
especially covering the side of the detector, yields an additional decline for
fully contained events (left panel) at large zenith angles. This eﬀect is energy-
dependent, and most pronounced at low energies, as shown in the right panel

14

for contained events. The variation in eﬀective depth of the detector is a
smaller energy-dependent eﬀect.

4 Comparison of Experimental and Monte Carlo data

Figures 13, 14 and 15 show three examples of the accuracy of the Monte Carlo
model in reproducing experimental data. Fig. 13 shows the energy spectrum
for 1-site events from an 88Y source placed at a 2 m distance from the TPC, 30◦
oﬀ-axis. On the left, the energy spectrum for MC data before including FLT
and SLT; on the right, the comparison of experimental data and MC data
after including FLT and SLT. A similar comparison for 2-site events from
the same exposure is shown in Fig. 14. Notice that the we use an absolute
normalization, given the intensity of the source, which is the same for the
energy spectra in Fig. 13 and in Fig. 14. The overall suppression of 1-site
events and the reduction of the large Compton continuum below 0.5 MeV
after FLT and SLT is apparent in Fig. 13. This is crucial for LXeGRIT, since
its eﬃciency is limited by the DAQ livetime fraction.

Fig. 15 shows an Am-Be energy spectrum, combining multiplicities up to 3:
since the cross-section for pair-production is large at 4.4 MeV, the single es-
cape peak (3.92 MeV) is the dominant feature. The full energy peak (FEP)
and the double escape peak are also well identiﬁed. At energies above 4 MeV
Bremsstrahlung plays a non negligible role in LXe 1 and it contributes to the

posed and the comparison shows that the main features are well reproduced.

4.1 A detailed example of eﬃciency calculation

A speciﬁc example of eﬃciency calculation for an 88Y source at a distance of
2 m, on-axis, is given in this section. 88Y emits two photons at 0.898 (branching
ratio 94.4%) and 1.836 MeV (100%). The total source rate was 2738 kBq,
therefore the source was emitting 1.836 MeV photons with a rate of 2738 kHz
and 0.898 MeV photons with a rate of 2585 kHz. Taking into account a 5700 s

one is left with 9.7
Counting the events in the two FEP gives the overall detection eﬃciency. This
procedure introduces an uncertainty of about 5% because of the necessary
background subtraction. The results are:

These small ﬁgures require some explanations. As discussed in Sec. 3.2, Fig. 11
gives an upper limit to the detection eﬃciency, including only the eﬃciency
for containment and the ineﬃciency due to passive materials. It is about 18%
at 0.898 MeV and 11% at 1.836 MeV. The light trigger eﬃciency alone reduces
this detection eﬃciency by a factor of almost 9 at 0.898 MeV and a factor of
3 at 1.836 MeV. The SLT further reduces the eﬃciency by a factor of 3 at
0.898 MeV and a factor 1.7 at 1.836 MeV (Fig. 7, from the same experiment).
This decreases the eﬃciency to 0.6% at 0.898 MeV and 1.9% at 1.836 MeV.

Losses due to noisy wires, events with excessive baseline noise on the anodes,
and other anomalous events identiﬁed and rejected in the oﬀ-line analysis,
account for the missing part ([7]–Ch. 3, and [14]). The eﬃciency diﬀers for
diﬀerent multiplicities, mainly as a result of the SLT, which is designed to
enhance the fraction of multi-site events. Ineﬃciencies due to DAQ livetime
and disk writing are independent of the interaction multiplicity, and the FLT
eﬃciency has on average little dependence on the interaction multiplicity.

There are various sources of uncertainty on the speciﬁc eﬃciencies, some of
them systematically lowering the ﬁnal ﬁgure:

5%);

the overall measured eﬃciency is known quite precisely, the main uncertainty
coming from the subtraction of the background beneath the line (
the FLT eﬃciency is known with 5% precision for 1-site events, but assuming
the same eﬃciency for higher multiplicities introduces a larger error. The 5%
precision is restored for multi-site events through a complete MC simulation,
as in Figs. 13, 14, 15;
for a typical data set, the SLT eﬃciency is known within 5% for all the
multiplicities, statistics usually being the limiting factor;
the eﬃciency of the oﬀ-line procedure to extract the signal is more easily
evaluated for 1-site events. In this case the eﬃciency in ﬁnding a good signal
is very close to 100% for energies larger than few hundreds keV, and the 30%
ineﬃciency comes from the fraction of “noisy” events rejected oﬀ-line. For
multi-site events the eﬃciency can be lower since, for instance, the chance
of not hitting a noisy wire decreases with interaction multiplicity.
the precision of the MC expectation before FLT and SLT should be within
5% once the assumed conditions are matched. Many factors can system-
atically reduce the detection eﬃciency: noisy or dead wires, higher energy
thresholds etc. Again, these factors are more relevant for higher multiplici-
ties.

It is clear from comparing the overall expected eﬃciencies to the measured ones,
as in Fig. 11 (where the measured eﬃciencies have been corrected for the es-
timated FLT, SLT and oﬀ-line eﬃciencies), that the expectation is optimistic
but within reason, the discrepancy ranging between 15% and 30% (roughly
equivalent, for example, to the eﬀect of 12 noisy wires out of 124), for diﬀerent
energies and multiplicities. As a conclusion, it is easy at this point to extrap-
olate what the eﬃciency would be if the DAQ could handle a 10 times larger
rate. With a light trigger eﬃciency as high as the one obtained in 1999 for the
same detector (50% or higher at 0.511 MeV, [13]) the ﬁnal eﬃciency could be
close to the one depicted in Sec. 3.2.

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have presented a study of the eﬃciency of the LXeGRIT in-
strument for detecting MeV γ-rays. We have shown that the detector response
is well understood in its various components and well reproduced through MC
methods. The LXeGRIT DAQ clearly constitutes a severe bottleneck when
dealing with sources which generate a relatively high trigger rate (few kHz),
not an uncommon situation, given the size of the LXeTPC. For the 2000 bal-
loon ﬂight in year 2000, we chose to reduce the eﬃciency at the trigger level,
to speciﬁcally select multiple Compton events in the few-MeV region. The ra-
tionale of this choice was to to maximize the fraction of multiple Compton
events given that the maximum event rate was ﬁxed by saturating the DAQ
bandwidth. If not limited by the current DAQ, this same prototype could
have achieved a detection eﬃciency as a calorimeter close to 20% at 1 MeV,
which can be obtained in the current conﬁguration only for sources generating
a trigger rate lower than 100 Hz.

Future experiments are using silicon detectors in a high radiation environment
and in high magnetic ﬁelds. The radiation tolerance of silicon improves by cooling
it to temperatures below 180 K. At low temperatures the mobility increases,
which leads to larger deﬂections of the charge carriers by the Lorentz force.
A good knowledge of the Lorentz angle is needed for design and operation of
silicon detectors. We present measurements of the Lorentz angle between 77 K
and 300 K before and after irradiation with a primary beam of 21 MeV protons.

Introduction

Future collider experiments need stronger magnetic ﬁelds for momentum measurements, be-
cause of the higher particle momenta. In high ﬁelds the drifting charge carriers generated by
traversing particles are deﬂected signiﬁcantly by the Lorentz force e~vx~B, where ~v is the drift
velocity and ~B the magnetic ﬁeld. As advantage of such a deﬂection one can consider the im-
proved charge sharing between the readout strips, which can improve the resolution for a given
readout pitch. On the other hand the charge sharing worsens the double track resolution and
the signal-to-noise ratio. As is well known[1], the drift mobility of electrons is larger than the
hole mobility, thus resulting in a considerably larger Lorentz shift for electrons than for holes.
Therefore, p+nn+ silicon detector with charge integration on both sides, show much less of an
eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld on the p-side, where the holes are collected, than on the n-side,
where the electrons are collected.

Typical position resolutions of silicon strip detectors are in the order of µm, while the Lorentz
shifts in a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld reach 200 µm for electrons in a 300 µm thick detector. Therefore,
these shifts have to be accounted for and an interesting question is the dependence of the
Lorentz shift on the irradiation dose. For an LHC experiment, where the dose reaches over
1014 particles per cm2, the change in drift mobility due to the defects introduced by the
radiation damage, might result in a continuous change of the Lorentz shift, and thus of the
calibration of the detector.

In order to increase the radiation tolerance of silicon detectors two scenarios were found by
the RD48– and RD39–collaborations: either the silicon wafer has to be oxygen enriched[2] or
the temperature of operation should be around 130 K[3]. At lower temperatures the mobility
of both electrons and holes increases rapidly (µH ∝ T −2.4) and Lorentz angles for electrons up
to 80◦ were observed in a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld.

In this paper we study the Lorentz angles of both electrons and holes in magnetic ﬁelds up to 8
T and temperatures between 77 and 300 K. This is done before and after irradiating a detector
with 21 MeV protons up to a ﬂuence of 1013/cm2, which equals 2.8 · 1013 1 MeV equivalent
neutrons.

2 Experimental setup

The Lorentz angle ΘL under which charge carriers are deﬂected in a magnetic ﬁeld perpendi-
cular to the electric ﬁeld is deﬁned by:

= µHB = rHµB

(1)

tan(ΘL) =

∆x
d

2

where the drift length corresponds to the detector thickness d and the shift of the center of
charge is ∆x (see Fig. 1). The Hall mobility is denoted by µH, the conduction mobility by µ.
The Hall mobility diﬀers from the conduction mobility by the Hall scattering factor rH. This
factor describes the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld on the mean scattering time of carriers
of diﬀerent energy and velocity[4]. The Hall scattering factor has a value of 1.15 at room
temperature and decreases towards 1.0 with temperature [5]. On the other hand, the mobility
increases with temperature proportional to T −2.42 [6].

The Lorentz angle can be measured by injecting charges at the surface on one side and observing
the drift through the detector by measuring this charge on the opposite side(see Fig. 1). Charges
were generated by injecting light with a wavelength of λ = 650 nm, which has an absorption
length of 3 mum at 300 K and 10 µm at 77 K. One type of carriers immediately recombines
at the electrode, whereas the other drifts towards the opposite side. The Lorentz angle for
electrons and holes can be measured separately by either injecting laser light on the n- or
p-side.

For our measurements the JUMBO magnet from the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe[7] was used
in a B = 10 T conﬁguration with a warm bore of 7 cm. A ﬂow of cold nitrogen gas through
the warm bore allowed the detectors to be cooled to temperatures between 77 and 300 K.
The detectors were double sided “baby” detectors of approximately 2x1 cm from the HERA–B
production by Sintef. The strip pitch is 50 micron on the p–side and 80 micron on the n–side;
the strips on opposite sides are oriented at an angle of 90 degree with respect to each other;
the strip directions are deﬁned as x- and y-direction, while the E-ﬁeld is in the z-direction. The
B-ﬁeld, perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, has to be in the x-y plane, but cannot be oriented
along the x- or y-direction, since then the Lorentz shift would be along one of the strips, i.e.
unmeasurable. Therefore, the detector was rotated 45 degrees, so that the B-ﬁeld was making
an angle of 45 degrees with both the x- and y-axis (see ﬁg. 2).

The strips on both sides are bonded to two 128 channel Premux charge sensitive ampliﬁers[8].
All signals are digitized for every laser pulse and averaged over a few 100 pulses. The signal
position is computed using either the center of gravity or a Gauss-ﬁt:

¯x(P H) =

P P Hixi
P P Hi

.

(2)

Here P Hi is the pulse height of the strip i and xi its position.

As can be seen from ﬁgure 3, the pulse on one side hardly moves due to the immediate
recombination, while the pulse on the opposite side shows a clear Lorentz shift.

The signal position is plotted as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld in ﬁgure 4, which shows
clearly that the signal on one side moves linearly with the magnetic ﬁeld, while the signal on
the injection side hardly moves.

3 Results

Instead of the Lorentz angle the shift in a 300µm thick detectors is plotted for a 4 T magnetic
ﬁeld, which is the one of interest for future experiments. The dependence on temperature and
bias voltage is shown in ﬁgures 5 and 6 together with simulations from the Davinci software
package by TMA[9]. From Davinci drift mobilities are extracted for a pad diode and Lorentz
shifts were computed using a Hall scattering factor of 1.15 and 0.7 for electrons and holes,
respectively.

For holes the temperature dependence is well described, but for electrons the Lorentz angle
ﬁrst falls below the simulation for decreasing temperature, as expected for a decreasing value
of the Hall scattering factor rH. However, below T = 160 K the Lorentz angle for electrons
rapidly increases and is a factor two above the simulation at liquid nitrogen temperature. The
simulation was done with a temperature independent Hall factor of 1.15 (0.7) for electrons
(holes), which is certainly wrong[5]. Therefore, the most likely interpretation would be in the
temperature dependence of the Hall scattering factor, since the drift mobility at low tempera-
tures is well known[5] and the electric ﬁeld dependence is well described by the simulation, as
shown in Fig. 6. However, if the data is a factor two above the simulation at low temperature,
then a Hall scattering factor around two is needed. Such a large rH is expected for impurity
scattering[4], but this cannot be reconciled with the high resistivity silicon used for the sensors,
for which the impurity doping is less then 1012/cm3.

Before irradiation the detector depletes fully with a bias voltage of 40 V, while after radiation
with 1.0·1013 21 MeV protons per cm2 the depletion voltage has increased to 100 V. This implies
that the bulk is inverted from n-type to p-type material, as expected[2]. The bulk damage of
21 MeV protons is aboout 2.8 times the damage by 1 MeV neutrons. The decrease of the
Lorentz shift for the irradiated sample below 100 V is due to the reduced eﬀective thickness
of the partially depleted detector. Numerical results on the Lorentz angles and Lorentz shifts
are given in tables 1 and 2 before and after irradiation, respectively.

Fig. 7 shows the signal from the 1050 nm infrared laser on the irradiated detector. This laser
has an absorption length of about 300 µm at room temperature, so it traverses the detector. It
can be seen that the signal on the p-side hardly moves with the magnetic ﬁeld, as expected for
a dominant contribution of holes by the charge integrating ampliﬁer, while the n-side shows a
Lorentz shift corresponding to roughly half the Lorentz shift of the red laser. This is expected
for ionization distributed in the detector, so the average drift length is half of the detector
thickness.

4 Conclusion

The Lorentz angle has been measured for electrons and holes separately. For the non-irradiated
detector the Lorentz angles of holes agree with simulations at all temperatures, but for electrons

4

the Lorentz angle agrees only at room temperature. Below ≈ 160 K the angle increases rapidly
to twice the expected value. A possible explanation could be a Hall scattering factor of ≈ 2
instead of ≈ 1.

After irradiation the Lorentz angle for holes is hardly changed at room temperatures, at least
if the bias voltage is raised to obtain full depletion again. However, for electrons the angle
decrease 25% at room temperature. At lower temperatures radiation damage increase the
Lorentz angles, both of electrons and holes.

Silicon detectors in high magnetic ﬁelds at cryogenic temperatures can be used without prob-
lems, if only the p-side (holes) is read-out. For an n–side read-out the too large Lorentz angles
can be avoided, if the strips are oriented such, that the Lorentz shift is parallel to the strips.
If this is not wanted, the Lorentz angle can be reduced by overbiasing the detector.

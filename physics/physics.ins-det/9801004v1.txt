Fiber technology applications for a
future e+e− linear collider detector

Abstract. The advantages and possibilities of ﬁber technology for the detection of
particles in 500 GeV e+e− reactions are considered.
It is suggested to build a fast
trigger which could be used also for intermediate tracking. A ﬁber preshower in front
of the electromagnetic calorimeter would allow to identify electrons and photons with
a space precision better than 100 µm.

INTRODUCTION

e+e− reactions have particular advantages for the study of particle properties
and interaction pecularities. That is the reason for the worldwide discussion about
problems and possibilities of future e+e− linear colliders in the energy range between
500 – 1500 GeV [1].

Detectors at such colliders have to handle very short bunch crossing times and/or
tremendous background rates originating from new sources due to the strongly
collimated beams. All these questions were studied in detail during an Joint
ECFA/DESY workshop in 1996 [2]. The following considerations arised from dis-
cussions during this workshop.

To investigate the capabilities of special detector conﬁgurations we simulated

benchmark e+e− reactions at 500 GeV :

and traced the resulting secondary particles through the detector, using the pro-
gram systems PYTHIA [3], ABEL [4] and GEANT [3].

The number of particles to be detected varies between 2 (pure leptonic W +W −

decays) and 200. Averages are given in table 1.

The kinematics is diﬀerent for all processes considered (see ﬁg. 1). W +W − pairs are
produced strongly in forward and backward direction in contrast to top and higgs
production. Particles from beamstrahlung are mostly low energetic and bounded
to the inner part of the detector near to the beam pipe, if a magnetic ﬁeld of 3 T
is assumed.

FAST INNER TRIGGER

To suppress background and select events with high transverse momentum jets,
a fast inner trigger could be useful in particular for collider operations with very
short bunch crossing times. We propose a layout as schematically drawn in ﬁg. 2.
In a magnetic ﬁeld of 3 Tesla two cylinders of 1 m length surround the interaction
point at r = 18 cm and r = 28 cm. Each cylinder consists of 4 layers of scintillating
ﬁbers of 1 mm diameter parallel to the z–axis. The ﬁbers are combined to form
Φ–slices for the inner and outer cylinder. For a one degree resolution one would
have to handle therefore 2 · 360 channels. The light is read out by light guides
coupled to normal photomultipliers or by hybrid devices withstanding magnetic
ﬁelds [5].

The simplest trigger condition is to demand signals above a certain threshold
from the same Φ–segment of both cylinders. Trigger times below 10 nsec seem
to be in reach with the above arrangement. A possible hardware scheme is given
in ﬁg. 3. It would allow even to form clusters between neighboured slice signals.
The trigger eﬃciency is limited only by geometry. For t¯t and Higgs production
it is nearly 100 %. The number of fake triggers may be decreased by smaller cell
sizes. With the conﬁguration described, the average occupancy is 5 %(W +W −),
14 %(t¯t) and 7 %(HX). In ﬁg. 4 the clear correlation between high pt tracks and
trigger clusters observed is demonstrated. No trigger is found using simulated

tracks from beamstrahlung. A typical particle distribution for this process in one
bunch crossing is shown in the rΦ–plane in ﬁg. 5.

CENTRAL INNER TRACKER

It is now easy to extend the mechanical trigger layout to build a central ﬁber
In addition to the ﬁbers parallel to the z-axis four layers of staggered
tracker.
ﬁbers inclined by 11 degrees will be added to both cylinders. With a pitch of 1.08
mm between adjacent ﬁbers one would have 1 050 and 1 650 ﬁbers per layer for
the inner and outer cylinder respectively, adding up to a total number of 21 600
channels to be read out e.g. via light guides and multianode photomultipliers [6]
or VLPC’s [7].

The space point resolution of such a conﬁguration would be ∆ rΦ = 80 µm and
∆z = 410 µm. The geometrical acceptance and average occupancy per layer is
given in tab.2.

actions 1-3 at the inner and outer cylinder of a central inner ﬁber

Due to multiple scattering and energy loss in the ﬁber material the described de-
tector will naturally inﬂuence the precission in reach for a following outer tracker.
That seems to be important only for particles with energies below 2 GeV, as can
be seen from ﬁg. 6.

FIBER PRESHOWER

A ﬁber tracker and preshower was ﬁrst successfully used in the UA2–experiment
[8]. We will closely follow that concept using however only ﬁbers in z–direction
because no precise tracking in two coordinates is necessary.

We suggest to build a ﬁber–lead sandwich cylinder with a radius of 1m and a total
length of 7 m splitted in two parts in the middle. Using ﬁbers of 1mm diameter and
3.5 m length arranged with a pitch of 1.05 mm this results in 6 000 ﬁbers per layer
and cylinder half. Six staggered inner layers parallel to z would allow a resolution
of ∆ rΦ = 50 µm. After 9 mm of lead corresponding to 1.6 radiation lengths, four
staggered outer layers still would give ∆ rΦ = 80 µm.

The very good two track resolution and electron identiﬁcation of such a device
allows excellent γ/e/π separation important for the precise measurement of many
physical variables. Adding up the signals of hitted ﬁbers for the inner and outer
preshower layers the corresponding diﬀerence of the number of detected photoelec-
trons is shown in ﬁg 7 for photons, electrons and pions. Correcting for the diﬀerent
number of layers one ﬁnds integral values of ∆Npe of γ/e/π = 33/105/0.

A typical t¯t–production event as seen by the preshower is shown in ﬁg. 8. In
ﬁg. 9 the position of tracks weighted with light amplitudes from the hitted ﬁbers
is plotted for sector 12 of ﬁg 8. One clearly can see the resolving power of the
detector.

An open question is how to read out the 120000 channels of the preshower.
Keeping in mind the low rate of interesting events there is no need to do it fast.
Therefore image intensiﬁer chains and CCD already applied for UA2 and now used
for the 106 channel tracker of the CHORUS experiment [9] may be a todays solution
also here.

SUMMARY

Fiber technology provides various interesting detector applications for a 500 GeV

e+e− collider.

A very fast inner trigger could select e.g. top and higgs production events with
high eﬃciency within about 10 nsec. Extended to a two coordinate measuring
inner tracker a space point resolution of ∆ rΦ = 80 µm and ∆z = 410 µm could
be reached. A nearly complete suppression of background of beamstrahlung seems
to be possible.

A one coordinate high resolution ﬁber preshower provides excellent γ/e/π sepa-

ration within ∆ rΦ below 100 µm.

1. Introduction

Keywords: Townsend coeﬃcient - gas mixtures - high ﬁelds - gas ﬁlled counters

The Townsend coeﬃcient, deﬁned as the number of ions produced per unit path by

a single electron traversing a gaseous medium, is of fundamental importance in all the

discharge processes, in particular in the description of the electronic gain of gas ioniza-

tion detectors[1] or plasma discharge devices[2]. Direct measurements of the Townsend

coeﬃcient are poorly reported in the literature[3,4,5,7,8], therefore the most used esti-

mate of the Townsend coeﬃcient is based upon a numerical solution of the Boltzmann

In this paper we report the measurement of the eﬀective Townsend coeﬃcient for Ar-

CO2 gas mixtures in the typical working condition of high gain MWPC [6]. We have

derived the eﬀective Townsend coeﬃcient α from the measurements of the gas gain M in

a cylindrical test tube, using a new method that is brieﬂy described in the following.

The gas gain M, deﬁned as the ratio of the anode current I over the primary ionization

current I0 that would be measured operating the tube in the ionization chamber mode,

can be calculated integrating the Townsend coeﬃcient from the starting point of the

avalanche r0 to the surface of the wire[11]. In practice we have

where S is the reduced ﬁeld, which in cylindrical geometry will be

S(r) =

being V the voltage applied to the anode, ra the anode wire radius, rc the cathode radius

and p the pressure of the gas. It is worth noticing that the coeﬃcient α which appears in

Eq. (1) is an eﬀective coeﬃcient in the sense that it is the diﬀerence between the absolute

coeﬃcient and the attachment coeﬃcient. Changing the integration variable[7] and using

Eq. (2), we can recast Eq. (1) in the form

ln M =

where Sa = S(ra) and S0 = S(r0). A small change in V is equivalent to a small change

variable,we obtain after some algebraic manipulations

which we have used to extract from our measurements the Townsend coeﬃcient.

It is

noteworthy that, being always ln M ≪ d ln M/d ln V , Eq. (4) can be used to estimate α

even if the primary ionization current I0 is poorly known, because d ln M ≡ d ln I if I0 is

constant.

2. Experimental setup

The experimental setup used in this work is shown in Fig.1. The active counting volume

is a cylinder with a thin anode wire of gold plated tungsten of 30 µm diameter, soft

soldered to the bronze feed-throughs and subjected to a mechanical tension of 60 g. The

wire is accurately located in the center of a precision stainless steel tube of (5.64 ± 0.01)

mm inner diameter and (0.18 ± 0.01) mm wall thickness. Research grade pure gases were

mixed, with relative percentages controlled to 0.5% accuracy level by two computer driven

mass ﬂowmeters; during operation the test tube has been ﬂuxed with a total ﬂow of 10

sccm. The high voltage is given by a power supply device, controlled with a IEEE-488

interface, while the current is read with a Keithley Mod. 485 picoammeter, using the

internal logarithmic conversion and remotely controlling the fullscale. The calibration

error of the picoammeter stated by the constructor is 0.4% plus 1/2 LSD of the readout.

The active volume of the tube has been exposed to a radioactive 55Fe source, whose

intensity was 100 µCi. The X-rays reach the gas volume by passing through a small

mylar window of 50 µm thickness placed on the cylinder external surface. The distance

Figure 1. Schematic view of the experimental set up

of the source from the mylar window has been adjusted to give a rate of current pulses

from X-rays interactions in the active volume of the tube of about 100 kHz. The primary

ionization current I0 has not been directly measured. Instead it has been calculated from

the above quoted rate multiplied by the average primary charge released in the counter

by the 5.9 keV X-rays, taking into account the escape for argon. As we said in the

discussion of Eq (4) the uncertainty in the determination of I0 has practically no eﬀect

on the calculated value of α. However we observe that also if the ﬂux of X-rays from the

radioactive source is constant, the counting rate will depend upon the relative composition

of the gas mixture, due to the diﬀerent absorption of X-rays in the two gases, and the

absolute pressure and temperature which determine the density of the gas. In fact the

primary ionization current I0 will be

being hti the average tracklength of the X-ray in the gas, mgas the molecular weight of

the gas, pgas its partial pressure, T the absolute temperature and R the gas constant. We

observe that a small variation of the pressure and/or temperature of the gas is ampliﬁed

by the exponential dependance in Eq. (5). In order to correct for small changes of the

pressure and temperature of the gas mixture during the run, we have monitored the

pressure of the gas with an accuracy of ±0.5 mb and the temperature of the test tube

with an accuracy of ±0.1 C.

3. Experimental results

We report here the results obtained in ﬁve diﬀerent experimental runs, repeated in

order to check the reproducibility of the measurements. Each run has been performed

in completely automatic mode. We have adopted a rather complex strategy after some

preliminary measurements, that have given to us a feeling for the various dynamical time

scales involved in the system. First we have observed that the ﬂow of the gas stabilizes

at the assigned partial ﬂows only after a period of at least half a day. During this period

we found that a constant applied voltage of 1000 V helps the conditioning of the test

tube to the new mixture. After this time the anode voltage is changed by the program

to the minimum voltage and raised in steps of 25 V, with slow ramp of 2 V/s. When the

high voltage has reached the programmed value, the program allows for additional 180 s

waiting time, before starting the current measurements at this voltage. The measurements

are continued until the cathode current is below 2 nA, which is in our experience the level

of self sustained discharge. We have checked that in this way no sequentiality in the

measurements is observed.

The anode current is measured integrating over a time window depending on the pi-

coammeter fullscale. For the majority of the performed measurements the integration

time of the picoammeter was ∼600 µs. As a consequence the single current measurement

is aﬀected by large poissonian ﬂuctuations. The statistical error has been reduced to be

7

negligible, compared with the calibration and linearity error of the picoammeter, aver-

aging over 300 single measurements of the current. Therefore we have assigned to each

current measurement an error corresponding to 0.4% of the measured value, plus a zero

point uncertainty of ±0.5 pA. Actually the LSD of the read out of the instrument corre-

sponds to ±0.05 pA, but we have observed that the zero point current reproducibility is

not at this level, likely due to some unavoidable parasitic current.

From the values of the current we have obtained the gas gain dividing by the calculated

primary current. Then we have corrected the calculated gain for the eﬀect of small

variations in the primary ionization current according to Eq. (5) using the pressure and

temperature data, monitored for each measurement. From these values the estimated α

coeﬃcient has been obtained, by evaluating the derivative by discrete incremental ratios.

In order to evaluate the robustness of the method against possible numerical instabilities,

we have also checked that the discrete values obtained in this way are compatible with the

smooth curve obtained from the diﬀerentiation of a polynomial ﬁt to the data. Finally we

have computed the eﬀective anode reduced ﬁeld and the value of the α coeﬃcient using

the actual pressure measurement, scaled to a reference temperature of 20◦ C.

The entire cycle of measurements and the data reduction has been repeated six times,

spanning from Ar-CO2 100-0% to 0-100% in steps of 20%. We have observed that each

set of curves is fully compatible inside the experimental error. In Fig. 2, which constitutes

the central result of this work, we have reported the average of the values obtained in the

ﬁve runs.

However a simple thermal distribution of the electron energies, leads to a function of

the type[13]

α(S) = A e−ǫionB/S

which has the appeal of a straightforward physical interpretation. In fact if we assume

that the accelerated electrons have maxwellian velocity distribution with temperature

kTe ≈ e E λcoll, the ionization rate from ground state of the gas is [14] ∝ exp[−ǫion/kTe]

giving B ≈ h1/e λcolli, while A = h1/λioni where λcoll is the m.f.p. of the electron for

elastic and inelastic scatterings, while λion is the m.f.p. for ionizing scatterings only. In

this context the hi brackets indicate an average of the energy dependent m.f.p. over the

relevant energy range of the electrons.

It is remarkable that our data for pure Argon and pure CO2, reported in Fig. 2, can

be well ﬁtted with Eq. (7) in the lower part of the reduced ﬁeld range, up to a value of

α ≈ 8, 000 ions/cm/atm. The ﬁtted value are reported in the second column of Tab. 1.

10

write for a mixture

Limiting our attention to mixtures of two gases, we propose here a simple additive

model in which the ionization densities produced in the mixed gas is the sum of the

densities in each gas. Therefore, starting from Eq. (7) for the pure gases, we can easily

α = p1 A1 e−ǫ1B∗/S + p2 A2 e−ǫ2B∗/S

(8)

where B∗ = (p1B1 + p2B2), p1 and p2 are the relative partial pressures, ǫ1 and ǫ2 the ﬁrst

ionization potential of the two gases.

In Fig. 2 we have reported as thin dot-dashed lines, the curves obtained from Eq. (8), in

which we have inserted the coeﬃcients A and B ﬁtted on the data from pure gases only.

It can be seen that the estimates of the Townsend coeﬃcient for the various mixtures

obtained in this way are not far from the measured values.

More interesting is the result that we have obtained from a two-dimensional ﬁt of the

entire data set with the model of Eq. (8), leaving as free parameters the coeﬃcients A

and B of the pure gases, and considering the reduced ﬁeld and the partial pressures

independently measured coordinates of the data points. In Fig. 2 we show the result of

the ﬁt in this case as heavy dashed lines. It is clear that in this way we obtain a more

reliable ﬁt of the coeﬃcients of the pure gases, because we use all the available information

on the A and B coeﬃcients for the pure gases at the same time. The ﬁtted parameters

are reported in the third column of Tab. 1. We have also performed a separate ﬁt to the

curves obtained from of each run. As can be seen from Figs. 3 and 4, where the 95%

conﬁdence regions are reported, we also ﬁnd that all of the ﬁts of the single runs are

compatible within 2σ.

11

We conclude that our work shows that our proposed method of estimating the Townsend

eﬀective coeﬃcient from the slope of the ln M vs.

ln V curves is experimentally robust.

It also shows that the simple functional form of Eq. (7) is adequate for predicting the

evolution of the Townsend coeﬃcient at high ﬁelds, if the detector is far from the regime

of self-sustained regenerative discharge. In spite of its simplicity the additive model for the

Townsend coeﬃcient, in the form of Eq. (8) can be reliably used to predict the behavior

of Ar-CO2 mixture. It will be interesting to extend in the future this type of investigation

to more complex mixtures, including gases with strong electron attachment and photon

regeneration such as for example the CF4.

A coupled microwave-cavity system of cylindrical TM010
single-mode has been developed to search for dark matter ax-
ions around 10 µeV(2.4 GHz) with the Rydberg-atom cavity
detector at 10 mK range temperature. One component of the
coupled cavity (conversion cavity) made of oxygen-free high-
conductivity copper is used to convert an axion into a single
photon with the Primakoﬀ process in the strong magnetic
ﬁeld, while the other component (detection cavity) made of
Nb is utilized to detect the converted photons with Rydberg
atoms passed through it without magnetic ﬁeld.

Top of the detection cavity is attached to the bottom ﬂange
of the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator, thus the
whole cavity is cooled down to 10 mK range to reduce the
background thermal blackbody-photons in the cavity.

The cavity resonant frequency is tunable over ∼ 15% by
moving dielectric rods inserted independently into each part
of the cavities along the cylindrical axis. In order to reduce
the heat load from the higher temperature side to the most
cooled dilution refrigerator part, the tuning rod at the con-
version cavity is especially driven via the Kevlar strings with
a stepping motor outside the cryostat at room temperature.
The lowest temperature achieved up to now is 12 ∼ 15
mK for the long period operation and the loaded Q value
at low temperature is 3.5 ∼ 4.5 × 104 for the whole range
of frequency tuning. Characteristics and the performance of
the coupled-cavity system are presented and discussed with
possible future improvements.

I. INTRODUCTION

Disclosing the mystery of dark matter in the Universe
is one of the most important and challenging issues in
cosmology and particle physics [1]. A pseudo-scaler par-
ticle called axion is one of the most promising candidates
for the cold dark matter. The axion was originally pro-
posed to solve the so called ”strong CP problem” in the
QCD theory [2,3], thus being well motivated from the
present particle physics. Astrophysical and cosmological
analyses on the contribution of axions to the evolution of
stars and also to the matter density of the Universe can
constraint the mass of axions and the mass window still
10−6eV [4,5]. From
10−3eV to
open now is from
the theoretical analyses of axion productions in the early
Universe, the most probable axion mass, assumed to be
the dominant component of the dark matter, is suggested
to be

10 µeV.

One of the most eﬃcient way to search for dark mat-
ter axions is to convert an axion into a single photon via
the Primakoﬀ process in a high quality-factor (Q) mi-
crowave cavity under the strong magnetic ﬁeld and then
to measure the excess microwave power in the cavity as a
function of the cavity resonant frequency (corresponding
to the mass of axions) [6]. Pioneering experiments along
this line were ﬁrst performed by Rochester-BNL-FNAL
group [7] and then by Florida group [8] with a cryogenic
microwave ampliﬁer and the super-heterodyne method.
The extension of the method has been further developed
with a large scale superconducting magnet and a cavity
system by a USA group [9].

We have developed a Rydberg-atom single-photon de-
tector [10–12] for the dark matter axion search. The
experimental principle of the method is schematically
shown in Fig. 1. The axion-converted photons in the res-
onant cavity are absorbed by Rydberg atoms in a beam
which are exclusively prepared to a lower state and the
transition frequency of which to some upper state is ap-
proximately set equal to the cavity resonant frequency.
Passed through, and just after exiting the cavity, the
Rydberg atoms excited by absorbing photons are selec-
tively ionized with the ﬁeld ionization method [13]. Since
the Rydberg atoms are prepared only to the lower state
by the multistep laser excitation with narrow bandwidth
single-mode lasers, this detection system is almost free
from the inherent noise. Then the noise of this detec-
tion system and thus ultimate sensitivity is mainly de-
termined by the background from the thermal blackbody
radiations in the cavity which can be reduced by cooling
the cavity and detection system as cold as possible with
existing methods.

The essential requirements to be fulﬁlled for the detec-
tion system are thus the following: 1) the system should
consists of coupled microwave cavities, one component of
which is under the strong magnetic ﬁeld, while the other
component is free from the magnetic ﬁeld in its inside
to avoid its strong eﬀect on the properties of the Ryd-
berg atoms to be used. 2) the resonant frequency of the
cavity should be continuously tunable over some range
of frequency to be able to search for axions covering cer-
tain range of its mass. 3) the cavity and the detection
system should be cooled enough to reduce the thermal
blackbody photons from the cavity wall, possibly down
to 10 mK range.

In addition to these fundamental requirements, the

1

quality factor (Q) should be as high as possible and also
the conversion eﬃciency of axions into photons in the
cavity should be as high as possible in order to make the
eﬃciency of axion detection high enough.

FIG. 1. Principle of the present experimental method to
search for cosmic axions with Rydberg atoms in cooled reso-
nant cavities. The axions are converted into photons in the
conversion cavity permeated by a strong magnetic ﬁeld, and
then the converted photons are absorbed by the Rydberg
atoms in the detection cavity which is free from the mag-
netic ﬁeld. Only the excited Rydberg atoms are ionized and
detected with the selective ﬁeld ionization method. The cavi-
ties are cooled down to ∼ 10 mK with a dilution refrigerator.

A pilot experimental apparatus of this line called CAR-
RACK1 has been developed and is being used to search
for dark matter axions at around 2.4 GHz (axion mass
of 10 µeV). To realize the above mentioned requirements
actually, two single-mode cylindrical TM010 cavities are
coupled through a ring-shape hole between them. One
component of the coupled cavity is made of copper which
is permeated by the strong magnetic ﬁeld produced with
a superconducting magnet and the other component is
made of niobium to expel out the external magnetic ﬁeld
with the Meissner eﬀect. Speciﬁcally the cavity system
is attached to the bottom plate of the mixing chamber
of a dilution refrigerator (DF) and thus the whole cavity
and the adjacent detector components are cooled down
to 10 mK range in order to reduce the thermal blackbody
photons in the cavity. The cavity resonant frequency is
tunable over
15% by moving dielectric rods inserted in-
dependently in both cavity components along the cylin-
drical symmetry axis. In due course of the development,
much attention has been especially paid to cool the sys-
tem down to 10 mK range and also to get high Q cavities.
Although the present cavity system was constructed
exclusively to be dedicated to search for dark matter ax-
ions, we believe that the underlying development of such
system will also be useful to other kind of applications in
general. In this note, the design principle and the actual
apparatus of the present cavity system are described in
sections 2 and 3. Then the characteristics and the per-
formance of the system is presented and discussed in sec-
tions 4 and 5 with possible improvements in future. Sec-
tion 6 is devoted to summarize the results of the present
investigation.

Assuming the dark matter of our own galaxy (dark

is given by

where ma is the mass of axion and the energy density of
the cosmic axions ρa is taken to be equal to that of the
galactic dark halo ρhalo

0.3GeVcm−3.

In the following we will ﬁrstly estimate the signal-to-
background ratio (s/n) of axion detection in a very crude
approximation without taking into account the quantum
nature of the Rydberg-atom cavity detector. The pseu-
doscaler axion of spin-parity 0− is converted to a photon
in the strong magnetic ﬁeld with the Primakoﬀ process.
The conversion rate in a resonant cavity is approximately
given by [6]

pling constant, the cavity resonant angular frequency,
the cavity quality factor, maximum magnetic ﬂux den-
sity and the geometric form factor of the cavity of order
unity as described later in detail, respectively.

Taking into account the volume of the cavity, to be
of order 103 cm3 for axions with mass of 10 µeV, the
number of converted photons produced by the Primakoﬀ
process is estimated to be of order 0.1 to 1 from the above
equations with conventionally available superconducting
magnet. While this number seems to be signiﬁcant, yet
the background thermal photon number is much larger
than this number even at 4 K temperature: In fact the
mean number of thermal blackbody radiations ¯nc present
in a resonant single-mode cavity is given by

¯nc =

e¯hωc/kBTc

B. Quantum treatment of axion - photon -
Rydberg-atom interactions in resonant cavities

Although the above analyses are useful for the very
crude estimation of the detection eﬃciency, more rig-
orous analyses have to be based on the quantum the-
ory of axion-photon-atom interactions as clariﬁed previ-
ously [11,14,15] in detail. Theoretical analyses are brieﬂy
discussed in the following.

The axion-photon interaction under a strong static
magnetic ﬁeld with ﬂux density B0 is described by the
Lagrangian density

La = ¯h1/2ǫ0gaγγφE

The parameter caγγ represents the variation of the axion-
photon-photon coupling depending on the respective

DFSZ [3].

The electric ﬁeld operator in the cavity

E(x, t) = (¯hωc/2ǫ0)1/2[α(x)c(t) + α∗(x)c†(t)]

(2.11)

where ǫ0 is the dielectric constant. The creation and
annihilation operators satisfy the usual commutation re-
lation

By solving the equations, the detection eﬃciency can
be numerically calculated as a function of various ex-
perimental parameters such as the transit time of the
atomic beam in the detection cavity, cavity temperature
and the number of Rydberg atoms passed through the
cavity. From these results the optimum condition of the
experimental parameters like the transit time of the Ry-
dberg atoms, or the velocity of the atoms can be deter-
mined. The cavity system was thus designed to meet
these requirement.

Along the line of these analyses, further reﬁned treat-
ment of the system has been recently performed by tak-
ing into account the spatial distribution of the Rydberg
atoms in the cavity and also the actual electric ﬁeld dis-
tribution along the path of the atoms in the cavity. The
resulting modiﬁcations were also taken into account for
the design of the cavity system, although the modiﬁca-
tions are not profound [14,15].

these parameters is the average number of Rydberg

teractions of the atoms with the cavity mode, the overall
coupling strength is proportional to the square of the
number of atoms in the cavity so that the most optimum
coupling strength can be tuned by adjusting the injecting
number of Rydberg atoms, thus with the oven tempera-
ture of thermal atomic beam and/or with the power of
the second laser.

Typical dependence of the necessary time to search for
axions over 10 % region with 3σ level on the number
of the Rydberg atoms are shown in Fig. 2. From this
dependence it is found that the optimum number of Ry-
105sec−1 for the 10
dberg atoms should be around 5
µeV axions with the mean atomic velocity of 350 m/sec.

system to search for cosmic axions with Rydberg atoms in

tor system are all cooled down to ∼ 10 mK with a dilution
refrigerator to reduce the thermal blackbody photons. Accel-
erated or thermally produced atomic beam of Rb in its ground
state is utilized for the Rydberg atoms.

C. Rydberg-atom cavity detector

Following the above theoretical analyses of the opti-
mum setup of the experimental system, the whole sys-
tem of the present axion search apparatus was designed
as schematically shown in Fig. 3. Thermal or accelerated
atomic beam, produced from a thermal Rb oven placed
beneath the cryostat, are injected into the low tempera-
ture cavity and stopped at 1K-pot plate of the dilution
refrigerator system after passing through the detection
cavity. Just in front of the detection cavity the ground
state atoms of 85Rb are excited to a Rydberg state with
2- or 3-step laser excitation. Laser beams are introduced
from the top into the cryostat and after interacting with
atoms are then extracted outside through a glass window.
The Rydberg atoms excited to an upper state are ion-
ized at the ﬁeld ionization electrode and the electrons
thus produced are guided through a series of focussing
ring-electrodes to, and detected with, a channeltron elec-
tron multiplier placed at the 1K-pot plate. The whole
cavity and the ﬁeld ionization detection system are cooled
down to 10 mK range with the DF. For this purpose the
top of the detection cavity is attached to the bottom plate
of the mixing chamber.

III. APPARATUS

The whole coupled-cavity system is shown in Fig. 4.
The cavity system is located in the inner vacuum cham-
ber surrounded by a liquid He bath, a liquid nitrogen
bath and a outer vacuum chamber.

Two TM010 single-mode cavities of the same inner di-
ameter are connected to each other through a ring-shape
hole. The resonant frequency of the cylindrical TM010
cavity is determined by its diameter D as

Two cavity components are made of oxygen-free high-
conductivity copper OFHC (conversion cavity) and nio-
bium (detection cavity), respectively. The detection cav-
ity is made of superconducting niobium to expel out the
external magnetic ﬁeld with the Meissner eﬀect.

The tuning of the cavity resonant frequency is accom-
plished by inserting and moving dielectric rods in both
the conversion and the detection cavities along the cylin-
drical symmetry axis. This choice of the tuning method
was adopted from its simple mechanism of driving from
the outside of the cryostat with stepping motors, al-
though the form factor of the cavity is not the best. The
rod for the detection cavity is driven from the top of the
cryostat, while that for the conversion cavity is driven
from the bottom of the cryostat.

FIG. 4. Coupled cavity and coupling structure in the

present cavity system.

A. coupled cavity

The two cavity components are coupled through a ring-
shape hole as shown in Fig. 4. The strength of the cou-
pling can be estimated by the frequency separation of
the two eigen modes. This separation is related to how
fast the stored power in one component of the cavity is
transferred to another component. This frequency sep-
aration was estimated with a two-dimensional computer
code SUPERFISH for alternating electromagnetic ﬁeld
calculations. The ﬁeld distribution in the cavity is af-
fected by the inserted rod position, due to the large di-
electric constant of the rod material. Although the elec-
tric ﬁeld direction is not always perfectly parallel to the
cylindrical axis, the whole ﬁeld distribution is consistent
with the TM010 mode for the full range of the frequency
as a function of the rod position.

One of the eigen mode (parallel mode) has an electric
ﬁeld directions in parallel for both components, while
in the other eigen mode (anti-parallel mode), the ﬁeld
direction of the conversion cavity is anti-parallel to that
of the detection cavity. The electric ﬁeld in the anti-
parallel mode is stronger in the conversion cavity than in
the detection cavity, while opposite situation is realized

to stepping motor  ( at room temperature )

FIG. 5. Schematic drawing of the driving mechanism of the
rod in the conversion cavity with Kevlar strings for frequency
tuning. The strings are moved with a stepping motor outside
the cryostat at room temperature.

B. Frequency tuning

The frequency tuning is accomplished by inserting the
dielectric rods to both the detection and conversion cav-
ities along the cylindrical axis. Depending on the size
of the inner diameter of the cavity, the diameter of the
tuning rod is determined for the resonant frequency to
cover the expected frequency regions. Aluminum-oxide
rod of 7 mm diameter is used for both cavities.

Since the cavity is cooled down to 10 mK range, heat
leak from the higher temperature side is extremely im-
portant. For the detection cavity, which is located at the
upper part of the cavity system and attached to the bot-
tom plate of the mixing chamber, the rod is inserted to
the cavity through a stainless-steel pipe and a TI-polymer
pipe [19] from the top of the cryostat. The rod was an-
chored to the liquid nitrogen shield plate, liquid He can,
and then to the cold plate shield (c/p shield plate) at

6

∼

100 mK temperature with a strand of copper meshes.
Only the c/p shield at 100 mK is available for the rod of
the conversion cavity to be anchored so that special care
has to be taken to avoid the heat leak from the room
temperature side coming into the cavity at 10 mK range.
The lower-side rod for the conversion cavity is thus moved
via Kevlar strings [19] with a stepping motor outside the
cryostat at room temperature. The driving mechanism
is shown schematically in Fig. 5. The Kevlar string has
quite low heat conductivity and still has enough strength
to drive the rod of weight
100 g. It has also quite low
∼
extensibility. The heat leak from the room temperature
parts is estimated to be less than 50 nW.

C. Magnetic ﬁeld shielding

Although we need strong magnetic ﬁeld in the con-
version cavity, it is easier to handle the Rydberg-atom
single-photon detector in a circumstance without mag-
netic ﬁeld to avoid the magnetic ﬁeld in the detection
cavity, because otherwise we have a complicated energy
levels of the Rydberg states due to the eﬀect of the Zee-
man splitting. To expel out the strong magnetic ﬁeld
from the detection cavity, following method was adopted
in the region of the detection cavity:ﬁrst, the external
magnetic ﬁeld at the detection cavity was reduced to less
than 0.09 T with a superconducting coil (cancellation
coil) with counter ﬂow of the current against the main
magnet coil. Second, the detection cavity and the cou-
pling part are made of Nb metal, which become a super-
conducting state at the cooled stage, thus the inner ﬁeld
being expelled out due to the Meissner eﬀect.

It is noted here that in order to well realize the ﬁeld free
region in the detection cavity, we have to carefully take
into account the eﬀect of the demagnetization ﬁeld in-
duced by the superconducting Nb metals. With a three-
dimensional eddy current program EDDY [20], the mag-
netic ﬂux density resulting from the insertion of the su-
perconducting Nb metals was calculated and the proper
shape of the Nb cavity were thus designed to expel the
ﬂux density out of the detection cavity. The detailed
treatment of the magnetic shield will be reported else-
where.

D. Selective-ﬁeld-ionization detector

Selective ﬁeld ionization detector consists of three
parts; ﬁeld ionization electrodes, transport electrodes for
the ionized electrons and the electron multiplier for de-
tecting the electrons. The ﬁeld ionization electrodes are
located in the Nb box set at the bottom plate of the
mixing chamber and the Rydberg atoms entered into
the electrodes after passing through the detection cav-
ity. The ionized electrons are then transported into the
electron multiplier located at the 1K-pot plate through

the number of ring electrodes for focussing. These trans-
port electrodes are distributed from the vicinity of the
ionization electrodes to the 1K-pot region through the
cold/plate region to eﬀectively transport the electrons.

These conﬁgurations are adopted to keep the cavity
and the ﬁeld ionization parts as cool as possible, since the
used channel electron multiplier produces heat power as
large as 10 mW. Moreover the channeltron multiplier can
not be used at such low temperature as 10 mK range, be-
cause the ampliﬁcation gain is strongly reduced a t such
low temperature. Therefore the channeltron multiplier
has to be always kept at temperature higher than 20 K.
In order to fulﬁll this requirement, the multiplier was
heated up with a heating coil surrounding it and sepa-
rated thermally from the 1K-pot plate by supporting it
with a low thermal conductivity dielectric material called
TI polymer. The introduced power of the heating coil is
about 30 mW and the current ﬂowing between the top
and the collector electrodes of the channeltron multiplier
is about 5 µA. Detailed description of the SFI detector
will be published elsewhere.

cut oﬀ for the estimation) and without (denoted 100%) taking
into account the lower part of the conversion cavity. See text
in detail for the treatment of the lower part of the cavity.

E. Associated equipment

In addition to the coupling hole between the two sub-
cavities and the holes for the frequency tuning rod, each
cavity has also a hole to introduce the Rydberg atomic
beam into the cavity and to make the atoms pass through
for detecting the excited atoms with the ﬁeld ionization
method. These holes have some eﬀect on the degradation
of the loaded Q value of the cavity.

7

Several associated equipments were also installed to
the cavity system. One is the electrodes for inducing
the Stark shift of the Rydberg states inserted along the
beam path in the cavity. The electrodes are used to tune
ﬁnely the Rydberg-atom transition frequency to match
with the cavity resonant frequency and thus to be able
to search for axions over some range of axion mass. The
detailed structure of the Stark electrodes will be reported
elsewhere.

Since the total length of the whole cavity system is
80 cm, some acoustic vibrational motion may possibly
be induced at the lower part of the cavity. In order to
avoid this vibration, the lower part of the cavity were
connected to the c/p cylindrical shield plate with several
small graphite rods. The induced heat leak from the c/p
shield to the cavity is negligible due to the low thermal
heat conductivity of the graphite used.

IV. PERFORMANCE

A. frequency tuning and the Q value

The cavity resonant frequency was measured with a
tracking analysis system in the ADVANTEST R3261A
spectrum analyzer. The coupling antenna in both the
cavity components are straight thin wire of about 1 mm
length. Semi-rigid UT141 cables made of Be/Cu were
used to connect the antenna to the main ampliﬁer out-
side of the cryostat. In cooled stage, a cryogenic ampli-
ﬁer and a circulator inserted between the cavity and the
main ampliﬁer outside the cryostat were used to increase
the sensitivity for the calibration. However once the cal-
ibration measurement has been ﬁnished, these auxiliary
equipments were removed, since they induce some noise
into the cavity system and thus degrade the performance
of the present Rydberg-atom cavity detector.

The tuning of the cavity resonant frequency was con-
trolled by varying the position of the rod in the cavity
with a stepping motor through a computer. A data ac-
quisition and control program LabVIEW was used for the
whole control of the tuning system. It is noted that the
tuning of the CC rod position is mostly eﬀective for the
cavity frequency tuning and is not so sensitive to the DC
rod position. It is therefore not necessary for the tuning
to ﬁnely adjust the positions of the two rods relatively to
each other.

The measured frequency range covered by the tuning
rod is shown in Fig. 6 together with the calculated result
for comparison. Although the extensibility of the strings
used is quite small, the eﬀect of backlash of the stepping
motors has some eﬀect of the reproducibility of the reso-
nant frequencies when back and forth movement has been
made. However these backlash eﬀect can be avoided by
always moving the rod to the same direction during the
course of the experiment.

4.5

The loaded Q value observed is 3.5

104 for the
whole range of the resonant frequencies tuned. The Q
value achieved is quite sensitive to the goodness of the
contact between the side cylinder and the upper and the
lower plates.
In between them we inserted and tight-
ened thin indium wires and/or thin copper rings which
have especially sharp edges on both side of the connect-
ing surfaces. Both methods worked well, although the
use of copper rings is more ﬂexible in practice.

The stability of the resonant frequency for a long pe-
riod is one of the important factors for the present pur-
pose of the experiment. We checked the stability of the
frequency by ﬁxing the rod position. It was found that
the resonant frequency is stable within 3 kHz for more
than 3 hours, enough stability for the present purpose.

B. Conversion form-factor

The form factor for the axion conversion is propor-
tional to E ˙B as described in the previous section.
In
Fig.
6 shown is the form factor G evaluated from the
electric ﬁeld distribution in the cavity with the code SU-
PERFISH. The magnetic ﬁeld in the cavity is calculated
from the superconducting coil dimensions with the pro-
gram POISSON.

The distribution of the G factor in the cavity is shown
in Fig. 7 in three dimensional representation. The distri-
bution along the symmetry z axis is mainly due to that
of the magnetic ﬁeld.

It is noted that from the view point of maximum G-
factor attainable, there should be some optimum value
for the length of the conversion cavity. However due to
the requirement of the eﬀective coupling to the detection
cavity, the conversion cavity is inevitably longer than the
optimum value. This longer cavity apparently results
in smaller eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld Beﬀ due to the weak
magnetic ﬁeld near the detection cavity region. However
actually this does not mean any serious deterioration of

8

the detection sensitivity, since this eﬀect of longer cavity
has been taken into account from the ﬁrst design stage.
The only drawback of this longer cavity is that we have
many series of higher TE modes which cross to the funda-
mental TM mode as we tune the frequency of the cavity,
thus loosing many frequency bands due to the avoided
crossings. By using another rod with diﬀerent diameter,
however, we can ﬁll these empty space in the frequency
sweep, since the diﬀerent rod brings avoid crossings at
diﬀerent frequencies.

C. Cooling

The temperature at the mixing chamber and the cavity
was measured with the anisotropy distribution of gamma
rays from an oriented 60Co single crystal source. A ther-
mometer of RuO2 was also used for the temperature mea-
surements at several places on the cavity surface. The
weight of the cavity system is about 25 kg and it takes
sometime to cool the whole cavity system down enough
to 10 mK range. In Fig. 8 shown is the cooling character-
istics of the cavity system with time after the pumping
of the 3He/4He mixture gas was started. It takes about 5
hours for the whole system to be cooled down to 12 mK.

The actual Q achieved in the present system is some-
what lower than the value estimated from this tendency.
This lower Q value may be due to many holes drilled and
the associated equipment installed in the cavity such as
the Stark plate electrodes in the cavity. Detailed analyses
on this point, however, have not yet been tried.

The form factor G of the present magnet and the cav-
ity system seems to be rather small even at the lower
frequency region where the insertion length of the rod
is rather small. As discussed already, this lower value
is, however, mainly due to the long length of the cavity,
in which the magnetic ﬁeld at the lower section is quite
small, because of the eﬀect of the cancellation magnet. If
we neglect the contribution of the lower part of the cav-
ity in the evaluation of the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld, then
the resulting values of G are improved as shown also in
Fig. 6.

Further improvement on the value of the form factor
may be possible by adopting the metal/dielectric post
system in replace of the present rods. Unfortunately this
improvement is diﬃcult in the present structure of the
cryostat, because no useful space is available at the mix-
ing chamber region where we have to install a selective
ﬁeld ionization detector and microwave power input cir-
cuitry to the cavity. However in a new large scale appara-
tus called CARRACK2 [21], we developed a new cryostat
system in which the detection cavity is set at the lower
side and the laser and the atomic beam are introduced
horizontally through the lower part of the vacuum cham-
ber, thus enabling us to install the post driving system
for the tuning of the cavity frequency. This development
will be reported elsewhere.

V. DISCUSSION

The system has fairly satisfactory performance for the
present purpose of the axion search experiment. The
15 mK. This
temperature achieved for the cavity is 12
could be further improved by reducing the heat leak from
the higher temperature side.

∼

We have developed the coupled cavity system for the
dark matter axion search with the Rydberg-atom cavity
detector. In order to fulﬁll the necessary ingredients of
the Rydberg-atom cavity detector, one of the component
of the OFHC-copper cavity (conversion cavity) is perme-
ated by the strong magnetic ﬁeld, while the other compo-
nent (detection cavity) was arranged to be free from the
external magnetic ﬁeld. The detection cavity is made of
superconducting Nb, with which the external magnetic
ﬁeld is expelled out to fulﬁll the above requirement.

The conversion cavity is attached to the bottom plate
of the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator and
thus the whole system is cooled down to 10 mK range.
Great care was taken to reduce the heat load from the
higher temperature side through the tuning rods driven

9

from the cryostat outside at room temperature. Espe-
cially Kevlar string of low heat conductivity was used to
access the tuning rod from the outside. The minimum
temperature achieved is 12 mK, and the loaded Q value
104 for the whole range of the
obtained is 3.5
∼
frequency tuning of about 15 %.

Introdution

The Borexino detetor is a large volume liquid sintillator detetor designed espeially for

detetion of Solar

7Be neutrino [1℄. The sintillation from the reoil eletrons is registered

by 2200 8(cid:17) PMTs surrounding the detetor's ative volume. All PMTs before installation

in the detetor were arefully tested in the speially designed test faility. The tehnial

desription of the PMT test faility at Gran Sasso for the Borexino experiment is presented

in another paper [2℄. Here we disuss in detail the most important PMT harateristis

measured during the tests. The measured harateristis split naturally into 4 lasses:

1. Dark noise measurements (using salers);

2. Charge spetrum measurements (using harge amplitude-to-digital onverters, ADC);

3. Transit time timing measurements on the short time sale of 100 ns (using time-to-

digital onverters (TDC) with 250 ps resolution);

4. Afterpulses timing measurements on the long time sale of 30 µs (using Multihit

TDCs with 1 ns resolution).

In this paper the detailed desription of the results of measurements for eah of the 4 lasses

is given. The set of harateristis for the PMT, whih passed the aeptane test was put

into the database prepared for the experiment, but beause of the huge amount of PMTs

used in the detetor, the straightforward use of the database for the detetor's modeling

would slow down the alulations. Therefore, for the purpose of the detetor modeling, the

average harateristis of the PMTs for eah lass of measurement have been determined.

2 Dark noise

In order to minimize the probability of the random trigger in the detetor, the PMTs

with a high dark noise rate were rejeted. Another drawbak of the high dark noise

rate is the shift of the energy sale of the detetor by the amount of the random harge

olleted during the event window. The tehnial spei(cid:28)ation for the fatory was set at the

maximum level of 20000 ounts per seond (ps). Tests showed that the initial dark rate is

dereasing exponentially during 3-4 hours, then it is still dereasing but muh slower, with

a harateristi time of up to 50 days. The typial example of the dark rate behaviour

during a 3 days run is shown in Fig.1. It should be noted that this is mainly thermoeletron

noise and orrelated with it ioni/dynodes afterpulsing (at the level of ≃

5%).

The other omponents of the dark rate, namely signals indued by high energy osmi

rays and by natural radioativity, are negligible. Furthermore, at the underground site of

the Gran Sasso laboratory (built at a depth of 3500 meters of water equivalent) the osmi

muon (cid:29)ux is redued by a fator 106
omponents, very strong limits on the ontent of the radioative elements from the U

. As onerning the natural radioativity of the PMT

T h
40K in the glass of the PMT bulb, were set for the

−

hains, and potentially very dangerous

manufaturer.

Some of the PMTs demonstrate a very rapid derease of dark rate, an example of suh

behaviour is demonstrated in Fig.2. The dark rate of the PMT has been hanged by

one order of magnitude after 1 day under dark onditions. Very probably this behaviour

re(cid:29)ets some onstrutive peuliarities of the PMT. Usually, the dark rate after 3-4 hours

was small enough to allow the starting of measurements. PMTs with a high dark rate

noise were kept in the dark for muh longer periods in order to exlude the possibility of

rejetion of devies with aeptable dark rate in stable regime. It should be noted that

the dark rate measured at the test faility is usually a fator 2-3 higher than the dark rate

at operating onditions in the detetor, due to the muh higher time of deexitation and

lower temperature at the underground site. An example of the dark rate behaviour in time

for a PMT that does not demonstrate dark rate stabilization is presented in Fig.3.

The dark rate of eah PMT has been measured every 10 minutes during the test. The

results for 2000 PMTs are presented in Fig.4.

It is a well-known fat that the dark rate of the PMTs shows signi(cid:28)ant deviations from

Poisson statistis. In order to estimate the stability of the dark rate ount we used the

exess variation over the Poisson statistis:

In the ase of normal (or Poissonian) statistis of the dark rate measurements the

variable S should be lose to unity. For the PMTs with a low dark rate (about 1 Kps)
left for a long period (at least 1 week) under dark onditions the stability S was in a range

of 1.2-1.5. The e(cid:27)et of the very slow derease of the dark rate an be due to the slow

variation of the average ambient temperature (for the same reason the S fator is greater

than 1 even for the very stable PMTs).

In the bulk measurements the PMTs were kept in the dark only for the period neessary

for the deay of the fast omponent of the dark rate (3-4 hours). The derease of the dark

rate during the measurements was the main soure of the bigger values of the parameter

S . The statistis of the parameter S over the measured sample of 2300 PMTs is shown
in Fig.5 (upper plot). One an see that high values of S , up to 50 and even more, were

observed. A strong orrelation between the PMT dark rate and the parameter S exists.
The lower plots in Fig.5 represent parameter S for the PMTs with low dark rate f < 1
Kps, and for the PMTs with high dark rate f > 10 Kps. It is learly seen the inrease

of the relative variane of the dark rate for the PMTs with higher dark rate.

3.1 Charge spetrum struture

The harge spetra of the 8(cid:17) ETL9351 series were studied at our test faility before the bulk

test of the PMTs start. The results were presented in [3℄, where a simple phenomenologial

model was proposed to desribe the data.

In partiular, it was shown that the single

photoeletron amplitude spetrum of the PMT onsists of two main ontributions. The

main ontribution (>80% of all signals) is desribed with a Gaussian distribution; the

remaining ≃

20% of signals are underampli(cid:28)ed and an be desribed by an exponential

distribution with a negative slope. Examples of various harge spetra are shown in Fig.6

(PMT with a poor resolution) and Fig.7 (PMT with a good resolution).

The data of the harge spetra for 2200 PMTs were averaged in order to obtain a

typial response of the photomultiplier. The proedure of spetra averaging onsisted of

the following steps:

1. The position of the pedestal in the harge spetrum is found and the histogram is

shifted in order to put its pedestal at the position orresponding to q = 0. The

histogram is normalized to 1.

The PMT response for a low light intensity ontains a ertain amount of multiple

primary p.e. signals. Assuming the linearity of the PMT response, one an write: qn = nq1
and σn = √nσ1 , where qn and σn are the mean value and the standard deviation of the

PMT response to n p.e., respetively. Taking into aount the Poisson distribution of the

deteted light and using a Gaussian approximation for the responses to Np.e. > 2, the

multi-p.e. response will have the following form:

is approximated by a Gaussian and P (n; µ) is the Poisson

A ertain distortion of the spetra is expeted due to the di(cid:27)erent PMTs illumination,

sensitivity and ampli(cid:28)ation. All the eletronis hannels were arefully alibrated in order

to provide exat knowledge of the ampli(cid:28)ation of the hannel and the high voltage of the

PMTs were adjusted with a preision of better than 2% [2, 5℄. Thus, the main expeted

soure of the spetrum distortions is due to the e(cid:27)et of di(cid:27)erent PMT mean ounts. The

mean photoeletrons ount was heked during the tests with a high preision, the results

are presented in Fig.8. In order to aount for the distortions of the spetrum due to the

variations of the mean photoeletron ount, the Poisson probabilities of formula (3) were

The mean gain of the multiplier is set to M = 2

multiplier is the produt of the gains at eah stage: M = 3g1g11

(on the last stages of

the eletron multiplier the gain an be redued beause of the spatial harge e(cid:27)et, as it

was noted in [5℄, but it is of no signi(cid:28)ane for our alulations), and we have a system

of two equations with two variables. Beause of the 11-th degree in the equation for g it
is pratially independent of g1and lies in the region 3.6 < g < 3.3 for 5 < g1 < 15. The
estimation of g1 for 2000 PMTs is presented in Fig.10, in Fig.11 is presented the relative

variane of the single eletron harge spetrum in dependene on the gain on the (cid:28)rst

the (cid:28)rst dynode. The average value of v1 = 0.34 orresponds to the quite low mean values

The relatively big amount of the small amplitude pulses is due to the fat that all the

events in the 60 ns window are proessed. As it will be disussed below, there is a notable

amount of small amplitude pulses whih arrives with a delay in respet to the main pulse.

They orrespond to the inelasti sattering of photoeletron on the (cid:28)rst dynode. A speial

measurement was performed with a seletion on the arrival time, showing the derease of

the ontribution of the small amplitude pulses for the event arriving in time interval t0 ±

σt .

The advaned study of the time-amplitude harateristis of the PMTs is now in progress,

the results will be presented elsewhere.

It should be noted that the model fails to desribe the s.e.r.

in all details. Though

the response to the more intense light soures with µ

1 is (cid:28)tted well [3℄, the very high

statistis of the data allows to see the deviations from the model. One an note three

features of the model in omparison to the experimental data: 1) the under(cid:28)lled valley

region between the main peak and the pedestal; 2) the lower peak value of the model;

3) the tail of the model is almost a fator 2 lower than the experimental data. The last

feature is a onsequene of the Poisson statistis of the multipliation on the (cid:28)rst dynode.

If one takes into onsideration the mean value of g1 ≃
at the position orresponding to > 2

5.7, then it is easy to hek that
g1 primary eletrons the Poisson distribution has

×

fator 2 higher tail. The mean gain for the underampli(cid:28)ed branh should orrespond to

the value 1/g1 in the ase when a primary eletron loses all its energy on the (cid:28)rst dynode
in inelasti sattering. One an see that the parameter A = 0.19 p.e. from Table 1 is very

lose to the value 0.2, that an be obtained dividing the mean ampli(cid:28)ation for a Gaussian
part of the s.e.r. spetrum q0 = 1.16 by the mean value of the g1 oe(cid:30)ient g1 = 5.7 (see

below). This fat on(cid:28)rms that the ma jor part of the underampli(cid:28)ed signals are produed

in totally inelasti sattering of the photoeletron on the (cid:28)rst dynode.

3.2 Charge spetrum haraterization

The PMT harge resolution is haraterized by the manufaturer by the peak-to-valley

ratio. The measured peak-to-valley ratio is presented in Fig.12.

For the numerial estimation of the detetor resolution this parameter has no immediate

signi(cid:28)ane. More informative is the relative resolution of the single photoeletron harge

The details of the transit time spetrum of the 8(cid:17) ETL9351 series were studied in [6℄

using the results of the bulk tests. The spetra of 2200 PMTs were used to produe an

averaged time spetrum. Beause every PMT operates at its own voltage, and the lighting

onditions depends on the position on the test tables, the proedure of averaging should

be preeded by equalizing the di(cid:27)erene in the measurement onditions.

its maximum at the position orresponding to t = 0.

4. All the histograms are summed together and normalized to 1 one more. The ob-

tained histogram ontains the mean harateristis of a sample of the PMTs used

with a peak (not mean time of the arrival) at the position t = 0.

The resulting histogram is presented in Fig.17. This is the PMT transit time p.d.f. av-

weak peak at t = 20 ns.

Below we summarize brie(cid:29)y the results of the study of these features performed in [6℄.

A small peak at about -24 ns is a result of diret photoprodution of the eletron on the

(cid:28)rst dynode. The amplitude of these pulses is a fator g1(ampli(cid:28)ation of the (cid:28)rst dynode)
5.7, these pulses
lower then the amplitude of the main peak. Beause a typial value is g1 ≃

are strongly suppressed by the disriminator threshold set at the 0.2 p.e. level. The shape

of the peak is well approximated by a Gaussian one with a total intensity of 1.22

The di(cid:27)erene dt = 23.2 ns between the position of the main peak t0 , and the position of
the prepulses peak tpp orresponds to the drift time of the eletron from the photoathode
to the (cid:28)rst dynode td with the time of (cid:29)ight of photon to the (cid:28)rst dynode ttof subtrated:
ttof . The time of (cid:29)ight an be alulated from the known distane
dt = t0 −

tpp = td −

between the photoathode and the (cid:28)rst dynode, whih is 123 mm (radius of the spherial

photoathode is 110 mm, the fousing grid is situated at the enter of the sphere, the

distane between the fousing grid and the (cid:28)rst dynode is 13 mm). Hene the time of

(cid:29)ight of photon inside the PMT is tof = 0.4 ns, and the drift time td = dt + tof = 23.6

ns. The drift time is the same for all the PMTs tested, beause the potential di(cid:27)erene

between the photoathode and the (cid:28)rst dynode is stabilized.

In setups with a large number of PMTs in use, suh as the Borexino detetor, the

presene of prepulses is a potential soure of early triggers of the system. With a total

number of the 2000 PMTs and the light yield of 400 p.e./MeV, the probability of early

trigger for an event of 500 keV is about 2.5%.

at t = 20.2 ns orresponds to the eletron's

transit time from the photoathode to the fousing grid and is aused by light feedbak

on the aelerating dynode. The spread of the peak σ = 1.07 ns oinides with the main

peak spread.

Pulses arriving with a delay relative to the main pulse in the time spetrum are alled

late pulses. The position of the last peak helps in larifying its origin. The di(cid:27)erene

between the position of the last peak and the main peak is ∆t = 47.6 ns, and it oinides
with a double drift time 2td = 47.2 ns. The double drift time an be explained by eletrons

whih elastially baksatter on the aelerating grid, then go away from it, slow down and

stop near the photoathode, and then are aelerated bak to the (cid:28)rst dynode to produe a

signal. Two experimental fats are on(cid:28)rming this onlusion. First, the position of the last

peak depends on the applied voltage, in the ase of the baksattering on the (cid:28)rst dynode

the drift time should be onstant beause the potential of the (cid:28)rst dynode is stabilized. The

seond argument is the geometry of the PMT dynode system entrane. The (cid:28)rst dynode is

designed to satter eletrons by 90◦ angle. The elastially sattered photoeletrons should

be transferred to the seond dynode with a higher speed [7℄, produing small amplitude

pulses preeding the main one. This phenomena was indeed observed in our measurements

(see [6℄), and we alled it early pulsing.

The amplitude spetrum of these pulses is very similar to that of the main peak pulses.

20

The total probability to observe photoeletron elastially sattered on the aelerating

eletrode is 0.024.

The shape of the main pulse has signi(cid:28)ant deviations from the Gaussian shape not

only in the region t < t0 , but in the region t > t0 , as well. The distortions of the shape

lose to the main peak position are due to the registering of the photons sattered inside

the PMT. The typial delay time of this signals is of the order of 1 ns.

The remaining ontribution to the late pulses orresponds to an inelasti sattering of

the photoeletron on the (cid:28)rst dynode, without any seondaries produed.

In this ase,

part of initial energy of the inident eletron is dissipated as heat in the material of the

dynode, and the drift time of the eletron in this ase depends on the remaining part of

the energy, and, naturally, is less than in the ase of elasti sattering. In the extreme ase

all the energy is dissipated, and, without any delay, the eletron is transferred to the next

stage of ampli(cid:28)ation, produing on the average a signal with an amplitude of fator g1

smaller than a normal signal. In the intermediate ase, the sattered eletron is delayed

by a time in the range 0

2td , and after returning bak to the (cid:28)rst dynode produes a

−

signal with lower amplitude in omparison to the amplitudes of the main peak signals.

The smaller the delay, the smaller is the amplitude of the signal. The total probability of

inelasti sattering of photoeletrons is 0.038.

4.2 Time spetrum Charaterization

The harateristi of main onern is the width of the main peak in the transit time spetra.

The results of measurements are presented in Fig.18. The width of the peak was de(cid:28)ned

by (cid:28)tting the main peak region with a Gaussian distribution.

As it was notied above, the prepulses orresponding to the diret photoprodution on

the (cid:28)rst dynode have a negligible probability due to the small size of the (cid:28)rst dynode in

omparison to the photoathode area. This pulses have small amplitude and an easily be

disriminated.

The more important harateristi in our ase is the amount of the early pulses, pre-

eding the main peak in the time spetrum by a few nanoseonds. We haraterize their

amount by the perentage of pulses in the interval up to t0 −
of the main peak and σ is the width of the main peak. The results are shown in Fig.19.

3σ , where t0 is the position

And, (cid:28)nally, the amount of the late pulses, arriving with a delay greater than 3σ

with respet to the main peak in the time spetrum, is the last harateristi of the time

spetrum of PMT. The results are shown in Fig.20. The mean observed amount of late

Late pulses, %

Figure 20: Statistis of the late pulses probability

pulses is 7.9% and orresponds to the CFD threshold set at the level of 0.17 p.e. The total

probability to observe elastially sattered photoeletron, as follows from the analysis of the

average transit time spetra, is 2.4%. This value is muh loser to the one measured in ETL

fatory tests. The reasons for this disrepany is the lower threshold in our measurements.

The diret hek with a CFD threshold set at the level of 0.3.-0.4 p.e. gives muh lower

values for the late pulses.

5 Afterpulses

5.1 Afterpulses spetrum struture

A photoeletron striking a residual gas trapped in the photomultiplier an ionize a gas

moleule, the ionized moleule will be aelerated bak to the athode releasing several

photoeletrons, thus forming an undesirable satellite pulse [9℄. The study of the ioni

afterpulses was performed e.g. in [10℄. In [11℄ afterpulse formation have been systematially

studied diretly introduing the trae amounts of various gases into photomultiplier tubes.

A photomultiplier exhibit the phenomenon of afterpulses in the miroseond range with

total afterpulses rate pa ranging from 0.1% to 5%. The upper limit usually is guaranteed by

the manufaturer for the spei(cid:28)ed HV. It should be noted, that the origin of the afterpulses

in PMTs is still being disussed.

23

The afterpulse rate pa is usually ited for the single photoeletron response and a ertain

time region after the main pulse. If a PMT is hit by a light pulse produing preisely n

p.e. and the afterpulse prodution is independent for eah initial eletron, then the mean

number of afterpulses will be de(cid:28)ned by the following relation:

pa(n) = n

pa

·

The value of pa(n) in (10) in priniple an be greater than 1 for large n, but the value

of pa an not exeed 1, otherwise the PMT will go into autogenerating regime.

For the series of the PMT responses to the light soure with a mean intensity orre-

sponding to µ p.e. with a Poisson law of the registered p.e. one should provide proper

averaging over the Poisson probabilities of the registering preisely n p.e.:

The delimiter in (11) re(cid:29)ets the fat that the afterpulses by their de(cid:28)nition are follow-

ing the main pulse. For the values µ

For (cid:29)ashes with a large number of initial photoeletrons seondary afterpulses are prob-

able. The probability of observing seondary pulse is psec

Formulae (10)-(11) are true as well for the afterpulses rate pa(µ, t)∆t in the interval ∆t
at any time t under the same assumptions. The last formula is the basi in the pratial

afterpulses measurements. One an see that the afterpulse rate due to the low intensity

light soure oinide with the rate of the afterpulses of the single p.e. response.

The afterpulse probability for the more than 2000 ETL PMTs has been measured at

the PMT test faility at the Gran Sasso Laboratory in the frame of the Borexino program.

It should be noted that Multihit TDC was used in the measurements in ontrast to the

more ommon orrelation measurements with ordinary start-stop TDC or multihannel

analyzers. In suh a way the aquired afterpulse spetra an in priniple ontain multiple

afterpulses (up to 15; the system was adjusted to measure the time of arrival of the main

pulse as the (cid:28)rst one). The disriminator threshold was set approximately at the level of

It is reported in literature, that an ion hitting photoathode an produe in average 3-4 p.e. [12℄

0.17 p.e.

The afterpulse spetra for 4 di(cid:27)erent PMTs are presented in Fig.21. The afterpulse

rates are presented in the (cid:28)gure as the exess dark rate ounted in Kps. The peak at

t

30 µs is due to the next laser (cid:29)ash inside the MTDC gate (laser (cid:29)ashed at ≃

≃

33 kHz).

The amount of pulses in this peak has been used to hek the laser intensity.

The spetra in Fig.21 have ommon features: relatively narrow peaks about 1 µs and

2 µs, wider peaks around 6.5 µs and 12 µs , and at t > 25 µs no afterpulses are present.

The analysis performed for the set of 2300 PMTs showed no signi(cid:28)ant dependene of the

afterpulses amount on the applied voltage. The di(cid:27)erene in the position of the peaks at 6

µs for the PMT with working voltage 1200 V and 1800 V is only 150 ns. This feature allows

to perform averaging of the afterpulse spetra over the set of all PMTs. The proedure of

averaging is performed as follows:

1. Using the measured value of the dark rate, the ontribution Ndark of the random

oinidenes at one bin was alulated and extrated from the value at eah bin.

2. For eah histogram the position of the main peak in the distribution and its integral

are found and the histogram is shifted in order to put its maximum at the position

orresponding to t = 0. The spetrum is normalized on the integral of the main peak

(number of true triggers).

3. All the histograms are summed together and normalized on the integral of the main

peak one more. The obtained histogram ontains the mean harateristis of a

sample of the PMTs used with a main peak at the position t = 0.

The resulting histogram is presented in Fig.22. The weak peak at 5 µs appears at the

histogram together with the already mentioned ones. The afterpulse amount is presented

in the histogram as an exess rate in Kps.

The systemati study of the origin of the afterpulses is now in progress and will be the

sub jet of another artile. Below we will give the main afterpulse harateristis.

Table 3: The results of the aeptane test

the di(cid:27)erent disriminator threshold setting. The measurements with a di(cid:27)erent threshold

showed that the amount of afterpulses dereases with a higher threshold. In partiular,

with a threshold set at 0.4 p.e. level one obtains pratially the same values as provided

by ETL.

6 Conluding remarks

More than 150 PMTs were rejeted during the aeptane tests of 2350 PMTs delivered

from the manufaturer. The main reasons were the high dark rate (58 PMTs) and the

high afterpulse rate (58 PMTs). 23 PMTs had a bad single eletron harge resolution

and 13 PMTs had a bad time resolution. The data is summed in Table 3. The seleted

2200 PMTs, that met the requirements of the Borexino detetor, were equipped with light

onentrators and µ-metal sreens and installed in the detetor. At the moment of the

artile submission (June, 2004), all the PMTs are installed in the Borexino detetor, the

detetor is sealed and ready to be (cid:28)lled with water.

7 Aknowledgements

We are deeply grateful to G.Korga and L.Papp who took an ative part in the test. We

also thank the LNGS sta(cid:27) for the warm atmosphere and the good working onditions. The

job of one of us (O.S.) was supported by the INFN sez. di Milano, and he is personally

indebted to Prof. G.Bellini for the possibility to work at the LNGS laboratory. The authors

appreiate the help of M.Laubenstein in preparation of the manusript.

Credit is given to the developers of the CERN ROOT program [13℄, that was used in

the alulations and to reate all the (cid:28)gures of the artile.

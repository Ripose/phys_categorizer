Abstract

The Multi-Chip-Module-Deposited (MCM-D) technique has been used to build hybrid pixel detector assemblies.
This paper summarises the results of an analysis of data obtained in a test beam campaign at CERN. Here, single
chip hybrids made of ATLAS pixel prototype read–out electronics and special sensor tiles were used. They were
prepared by the Fraunhofer Institut f¨ur Zuverl¨assigkeit und Mikrointegration, IZM, Berlin, Germany. The sensors
feature an optimized sensor geometry called “equal sized bricked”. This design enhances the spatial resolution for
double hits in the long direction of the sensor cells.

Key words: multi chip module deposited, MCM-D, ATLAS, pixel, semiconductor detector, thin ﬁlm technology, spatial

1. Introduction

The Multi-Chip-Module-Deposited (MCM-D)
technique was studied as part of the R&D work
for the ATLAS pixel detector project (for the lat-
ter, see several contributions in this proceedings).
Although for this system a more conservative ap-
proach has been chosen using a ﬂexible circuit
glued on the back side of the sensor and wire–
bonds for the i/o–connections of the electronics,
the MCM-D technique allows for some unique
features. As bump–bonding is used for all the con-
nections, the ﬁnal modules are robust and easy to
handle.

The realization of the connection structures (see
section 2) enhances the bump-bonding process,
which is needed for hybrid pixel detectors. This
reduces the amount of manual assembly steps and
moves the module assembly into the semiconduc-
tor industry environment using wafer treatment
technologies. The hybrids analysed here where
fabricated by the Fraunhofer Institut f¨ur Zu-
verl¨assigkeit und Mikrointegration, IZM (Berlin,
Germany). The manufacturing at IZM included
the build up of the thin–ﬁlm layers, the bumping
with Pb/Sn, and the ﬂip-chip assembly. A detailed
description of the same bumping process, used for
the ATLAS pixel modules, is presented by IZM in
these proceedings.

2. MCM–D technique

By using thin ﬁlm technologies like sputtering,
electro–plating, and spin-on techniques the inter-
connect system can be built in an approximately
30 µm thin multi–layer system directly on the sen-
sor substrate at wafer level. At ﬁrst a spin–on tech-
nique is used to deposit a thin layer of photosen-
sitive polymer onto a prepared silicon sensor. The
polymer is benzocyclobutene in a photosensitive
formulation, called Photo–BCB and distributed by
Chemical, which allows for the use of standard
techniques of the semiconductor industry to struc-
ture the layer. Via openings of diameters down to
22 µm have been produced with low failure rate [1].
The subsequent Cu layer is deposited by electro–
plating to achieve a suﬃcient layer thickness for
power distribution within the module. By using a
combination of sputtering, photo resist patterning,
and electro–plating, minimal structure sizes down
to 15 µm line width and 15 µm gap have been re-
alized for the ﬁrst time in our current design gen-
eration.

Figure 1 shows a picture of a module built in
MCM–D. Four Cu layers of ∼ 3.5µm thickness are
suﬃcient to fulﬁl the ATLAS requirements for volt-

age drops on the two supply voltages to be less than
100 mV. The length of the supply lines extend over
the full length of a module with a minimal width of
≈ 320 µm. The signal bus system is designed in a
microstrip conﬁguration with outstanding perfor-
mance and low crosstalk [2]. The performance of
such a module has been described in [3].

3. Equal–Sized–Bricked Sensors

Building up the module’s interconnection struc-
tures on the sensor means that every sensor cell
has to be connected to it’s corresponding readout
electronics through the thin-ﬁlm layers. A feed-
through structure establishing this connection is
shown in cross section in ﬁgure 2. The performance
of the system is not aﬀected by the additional ca-
pacitance and resistance of the feed-throughs, as
shown in [2,1].
The feed-thoughs decouple the sensor geometry
from the layout of the electronics.

In conventional hybrid detectors the sensor ge-
ometry has to follow the size of the electronic cells.
In addition, gaps at chip borders need to be ﬁlled by
enlarged or coupled sensor cells. The feed-throughs
allow for an optimisation of the sensor layout and
a matching to the electronic cells. For the stud-
ies done here, an “equal–sized–bricked” design has
been implemented making use of two main ideas.
The ﬁrst is to divide the total area covered by the
electronic ASICs (including dead rims and gaps)
by the number of readout channels. The resulting
dimensions are taken for the sensor cell. The read-
out electronics taken from an ATLAS pixel prepro-
duction has a cell size of 400 × 50µm2. Each chip
is providing 2880 readout channels, resulting in a
total area of 16.4 × 60.4mm2 to be covered by the

Fig. 3. Geometry of the parallel bias-grid design. High-
lighted is the symmetry cell.

lighted is the symmetry cell.

sensor. This includes additional area to cover the
100µm wide dead rim of the electronics and a gap of
200µm between chips. The resulting size of a sensor
cell for an equal sized design is 422.22 × 52.25µm2.
The second is to “shift” even rows of sensor cells
by a quarter of a cell length to one side and odd
rows by the same amount to the right. The result
looks like a bricked wall and features an equal sized
segmentation, which eases the spatial reconstruc-
tion and an enhanced spatial resolution for double
hits composed by cells in adjacent rows.

In order to keep the ability to test the n-on-n sen-
sors before the ﬂip–chip hybridisation, two diﬀer-
ent geometries of the bias–grid were implemented.

3.1. Parallel Grid Design

As shown in ﬁgure 3, the parallel grid imple-
ments a bias–grid line parallel to the long direction
of the sensor cells every third row. The intermedi-
ate rows are bound to the bias–grid by a punch–
through dot in the middle of the pixel. The sym-
metry cell of this design is highlighted in ﬁgure 3.
In ﬁgure 3, one can also see the solution that
was chosen for the outer edges of a module. Not to
have an increased capacitive coupling to the sen-
sors outer rim, the sensor cell size was set to 5/4
for the even and 3/4 for the odd rows of the ﬁrst
column, respectively. This is only necessary at the
outer edge of the sensor, not between the front-end
chips. In laboratory measurements, it was observed
that these enlarged (reduced) cells shows a mean
equivalent noise charge 3 of 220 e− (long) and 180
e− (short), respectively. This is to be compared to
the noise of 200e− for the uniform pixel size, and

3 The equivalent noise charge is deﬁned as the standard
deviation of the error function that is observed by scanning
the threshold of the discriminator.

demonstrates that the noise is dominated by the
sensors capacitance and not by the feed-throughs.

3.2. Zig-Zag Grid Design

A diﬀerent approach to implement the bias-grid
is shown in ﬁgure 4. Here, the bias-grid follows the
bricked structure and all bias dots are at the short
edges of the sensor cells.

Both designs where implemented and tested. In
the following sections a comparism of the two with
respect to charge collection and spatial resolution
will be given. The principle ideas of the measure-
ments enabled by data taken in test beam environ-
ment and about the set-up used can be found in
[7].

4. Charge Collection

Although a binary readout with a discriminator
is implemented in the ATLAS pixel electronics, a
so-called “Time over Threshold” mechanism pro-
vides information about the charge collected by
a sensor cell. In ﬁgure 5, the charge collected by
single hits is given. The ﬁtted Landau distribu-
tion, folded with a Gaussian to cope for the noise
sources, describes the data very well. The most
probable charge is determined as 24, 270 ± 10e−.
The error does not account for the possible error in
the calibration, which can well explain the discrep-
ancy to the expected 22, 400e− in a 280µm thick
sensor. The tail to lower charges is not described
by the function and is explained by charge losses to
adjacent cells which did not reach the threshold.

4.2. Charge Collected

The sum of the charges seen by the pixels in a
cluster gives a lower limit of the total charge liber-
ated in the sensor. Due to the threshold applied by
the discriminator in each pixel cell, some fraction
of charge may be unreported in case of unequal
charge sharing.

In ﬁgure 7, the summed charges of one to four
pixel cluster sizes are shown for diﬀerent sensor
geometries. For reference, the plots are shown for
a standard sensor in ﬁgure 7(a). This sensor has
neither bricking nor equal sized pixels. This can be
seen in the fact that triple and quadruple clusters
appear in the same shape.

Both have a Landau peak caused by minimum
ionizing particles and a broad peak at higher
charges, caused by higher energy depositions. For
the single hits, one can observe a tail towards
lower values, which is caused by charge (below
threshold) lost to neighbouring cells.

If we now compare this with ﬁgure 7(b), which is
the charge collected by an equal sized bricked sen-
sor with parallel grid, one observes that the Lan-
dau peak for the quadruple hits has disappeared.
A bricked geometry does not allow a minimal ion-
izing particle to deposit energy in four sensor cells.
Instead, the Landau peak of the triple hit clusters
increased. Especially for limited operation condi-
tions (like partly depleted sensors), this leads to an
improved eﬃciency.

4.1. Charge Collection Maps

Figure 6 shows the charge collection maps of the
symmetry cells of a parallel grid and a zig-zag grid
sensor. Here, all the charge seen by the cluster is
summed up and plotted versus the hit prediction
of the track deﬁning telescope. One can observe a
slightly higher charge loss for the parallel grid. We
will see later on that this is at least partly explained
by the diﬀerent threshold of the two devices. It is
to be pointed out that no variation of the charge
collection could be observed along the columns of
the device. This means that there is no additional
charge loss due to the increasing routing distances
towards the middle axis of a module.

charge [kelectrons]

(a) standard sensor

One can also see an increase in the tail of low
charges for single hits. This is due to the fact the
the threshold of this device was tuned to 5000e−.
This threshold is rather high, which causes some
visible fraction of lost charge, but the tracks are
registered, because there is no charge sharing be-
tween four, but only between three cells.

This can be conﬁrmed by inspecting the ﬁgure
7(c). This shows the cluster charges observed in
an equal sized bricked sensor with a zig-zag bias
grid. The thresholds where tuned to 3000e−. As ex-
pected, the tail of low charged single hits reduces,
turning into double and mostly triple hits. The
Landau-peak is now clearly visible for the triple
hits.

We made some assumptions here regarding the
constraints on charge distribution given by the sen-
sors geometry. These can be conﬁrmed by looking
at the track positions for the diﬀerent cluster sizes,
which will be done in the next section, together
with the analysis of the spatial resolution.

5. Spatial Resolution

The spatial resolution may be determined by the
residual of the centre of a cluster of pixels with re-
spect to the prediction of the telescope. The tele-
scope used has a track prediction uncertainty of
5µm within the pixel plane.

In ﬁgure 8, the hit locations of tracks causing
a single hit are shown within the cell ﬁred. One
can observe the “noses” in the middle of the long
edges, where the three pixel area is situated. The
corresponding plots for two, three and four pixel
cluster are given in ﬁgure 9. For the two and three
pixel cluster, the behaviour is as expected. One
can clearly see the edges of the cells and the areas,
where hits are causing three hit clusters.

For the four pixel clusters, no clear accumula-
tion can be observed. This is due to that fact that
four pixel clusters need a large charge to be de-
posited and spread over an appropriate area (see
above). The same is true for part of the triple hit

clusters (ﬁg. 9(b)), where one can observe sharp
peaks from the minimum ionising particles in the
regions of three cell edges. In addition, there is a
“ﬂoor” of non-located hits caused by large energy
depositions.

5.2. Residuals

The Residuals are given by the diﬀerences be-
tween the geometrical centres of the clusters and
the track positions, as determined by the telescope.
The TOT information (see section 4) can be used
to improve the information given by the pixels in
case of multiple hits. For the the results shown in
this section, only the geometrical information is
used.

The analysis of the short direction is not dis-
cussed here. This is because there is no interesting
structure visible for the equal sized sensor. (As it is
for the standard sensor, featuring coupled cells to
cover the middle axis of the module.) This is dif-
ferent for the long direction of the cells, as shown
in ﬁgure 10.

For better visualisation, there are shifts intro-
duced in all plots shown. The double and quadru-
ple hit curves are shifted by half of the pixel length.
For double hits, only those of a single column are
accepted. This suppresses the expected bump near
zero (shown here at half pixel length), caused by
two hit clusters of pixels facing their short edges.
For the standard sensor, the single hit curve
shows a plateau of the usual cell length of 400µm.
There is a step extending this to 600µm, caused
by the elongated cells to cover the inter-chip re-

be twofold. The double hits don’t show any struc-

which is the full cell length. The triple hits show
the broad distribution of high charge hits and the
peak of the minimum ionizing particles. This is
shifted by a third of the pixel length, because these
clusters consist of two pixels in one row and one in
the neighbouring row. This shifts the geometrical
centre. Similarly, for the quadruple clusters, there
is a broad background and a peak around the pre-
diction. This is because in this non-bricked design,
there is a region where four cell edges are located.
The residuals for the equal sized bricked designs
are much cleaner (ﬁgure 10(b) and 10(c)). There is
no peak in the quadruple cluster location, and the
peak for the triple hits is more pronounced, as seen
in the charges collected shown in ﬁgure 7. There is
a small peak visible for the single hit, caused by the
“noses” shown in ﬁgure 8. For the double hits, the
improved resolution of half a pixel length is clearly
visible. The width of this plateau is 208µm, which
is to be compared to the cell length of 422.22µm.

6. Summary

The performance of equal sized bricked sensors
making use of the possibilities oﬀered by the use of
the MCM-D technique was demonstrated in a test
beam environment. The charge collection is not
degraded, neither by the sensor geometry nor by
the feed-through structures. This geometry does
not allow for low charges induced in the sensor to
be shared by more than three pixel cells, which
yields an improved eﬃciency. The cleaner residual
plots eases the tracking algorithms, needing less
distinction of cases, and the spatial resolution for
double hits is improved by a factor of two for the
long direction of the cells. The results presented
here are part of a thesis [8], where more detailed
information can be found.

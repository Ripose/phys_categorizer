Abstract

The frequency ﬂicker of an oscillator, which appears as a 1/f 3 line in
the phase noise spectral density, and as a ﬂoor on the Allan variance plot,
originates from two basic phenomena, namely: (1) the 1/f phase noise
turned into 1/f frequency noise via the Leeson eﬀect, and (2) the 1/f
ﬂuctuation of the resonator natural frequency. The discussion on which is
the dominant eﬀect, thus on how to improve the stability of the oscillator,
has been going on for years without giving a clear answer. This article
tackles the question by analyzing the phase noise spectrum of several
commercial oscillators and laboratory prototypes, and demonstrates that
the ﬂuctuation of the resonator natural frequency is the dominant eﬀect.
The investigation method starts from reverse engineering the oscillator
phase noise in order to show that if the Leeson eﬀect was dominant, the
resonator merit factor Q would be too low as compared to the available
technology.

1 Introduction and summary

In the domain of ultra-stable quartz oscillators used in the most demanding ap-
plications, like space and atomic fountain clocks, we notice that the frequency
ﬂicker is often the most critical parameter. The required stability is some-
times in the upper 10−14 (Allan deviation) at 1–30 s or so, which can only be
achieved in the lower HF band (5–10 MHz), and after selection. In such cases,
identifying the dominant ﬂicker mechanism is far from being trivial. Whereas
some authors strongly suggest that the ampliﬁer noise can be the parameter
that limit the frequency stability, rather than the ﬂickering of the resonator
natural frequency [Wal95, BMG+99], the general literature seems not to give
a clear answer. This conclusion results from a set of selected articles, which
includes the measurement of the frequency stability [WW75, RGBG00] and the
interpretation of the ﬂicker noise of crystal resonators [Kro98, Kro05]; the de-
sign fundamentals of the nowadays BVA resonators [Bes77]; some pioneering
works on the low-frequency noise in quartz oscillators [BOM75, Dri75]; more
recent articles focusing on speciﬁc design solutions for ultra-stable oscillators
[Nor91, Nor96, CCG+98, CCL+03, TJA97]; and, as a complement, a thorough

review of the SiO2 crystal for the resonator fabrication is found in [Bri85]. Con-
versely, in everyday-life oscillators, which span from the low-cost XOs to the
OCXOs used in telecommunications and instrumentation, the relative simplic-
ity of the low-noise electronics required indicates that the frequency ﬂicker is
chieﬂy the 1/f ﬂuctuation of the resonator.

In a previous work [Rub05], now extended to more commercial products
and laboratory prototypes, we have analyzed the phase noise spectrum of some
oscillators, aiming at understanding the internal mechanisms and parameters.
We look at the phase-noise spectrum from the right hand to the left, hence
from the higher Fourier frequencies to the lower, matching theory, technology
and physical insight. In this way we get information on the sustaining ampliﬁer
on the output buﬀer, on the Leeson eﬀect and on the resonator.

In this article we ﬁrst explain the phase noise mechanisms in ampliﬁers.
Then we introduce the Leeson eﬀect, which consists of the phase-to-frequency
conversion of noise below the resonator cutoﬀ (Leeson) frequency fL = ν0
2Q . Fi-
nally, we analyze the phase noise spectral density Sϕ(f ) of a few oscillators.
The conclusion that the resonator natural frequency is the main cause of fre-
quency ﬂickering is based on experimental facts. After taking away the eﬀect
of the output buﬀer, we calculate the frequency f ′′
L at which the oscillator f −3
line crosses the f −1 line of the sustaining ampliﬁer. Provisionally assuming
that f ′′
L is the the Leeson frequency, we observe that the resonator merit factor
Qs = ν0
thereby calculated is far too low for a high-tech resonator. Conversely,
2f ′′
L
under any reasonable assumption about the true merit factor, the Leeson eﬀect
L. Therefore the Leeson f −3 line on the Sϕ(f )
f ′′
is found at a frequency fL
plot is well hidden below the resonator ﬂuctuation.

2 Phase noise fundamentals

Let the quasi-perfect oscillator sinusoidal signal of frequency ν0

v(t) = V0[1 + α(t)] cos[2πν0t + ϕ(t)] .

(1)

where α(t) is the fractional amplitude noise, and ϕ(t) is the phase noise. The
AM noise is not essential to this work. The phase noise is best described in
terms of Sϕ(f ), i.e., the one-sided power spectral density of ϕ(t), as a function
of the Fourier frequency f . In addition to f , we use the angular frequency ω for
both carrier-related frequencies (ω = 2πν), and Fourier frequencies (ω = 2πf )
without need of introducing it, and the normalized frequency ﬂuctuation y =
ν−ν0
. The quantities ν, f and y refer to one-sided transforms, ω to two-sided
ν0
transforms. Frequency ﬂuctuations are described in terms of Sy(f ), related to
Sϕ(f ) by

Sy(f ) =

Sϕ(f ) .

3 Phase noise in rf (and microwave) ampliﬁers

3.1 White noise

The equivalent noise spectrum density at the ampliﬁer input is N = F kT0,
where F is the noise ﬁgure and kT0 is the thermal energy. This type of noise
is additive. In the presence of a carrier of power P0, the phase noise spectral
density is

Sϕ(f ) = b0f 0 (constant)

(6)

When ampliﬁers are cascaded, the noise contribution of each stage is divided by
the gain of all the preceding stages (Friis formula [Fri44]). Accordingly, in most
practical cases the total noise is chieﬂy the noise of the ﬁrst stage. Of course,
this also holds for phase noise.

3.2 Flicker noise

Understanding the close-in noise starts from the bare observation that the out-
put spectrum is of the white type—ﬂat in a wide frequency range—when the
carrier power is zero, and that noise shows up close to the carrier only when a
suﬃciently large carrier power is present at the ampliﬁer output. The obvious
consequence is that the close-in ﬂickering results from a parametric eﬀect by
which the near-dc ﬂicker noise modulates the carrier in amplitude and phase.

The simplest way to understand the noise up-conversion is to model the

ampliﬁer signal as a nonlinear function truncated to the 2nd order

in which the complex input signal

vo(t) = a1vi(t) + a2v2

i (t) + . . . ,

vi(t) = Vi ejω0t + n

′

(t) + jn

(t)

contains the carrier and the internally generated near-dc noise n(t) = n′(t) +
jn′′(t). Rather than being an easy-to-identify voltage or current, n(t) is an
abstract random signal that also accounts for the eﬃciency of the modulation
process. Combining (7) and (8) and selecting the terms close to the carrier
frequency ω0, we get

vo(t) = Vi

Hence, the random ﬂuctuations are

Deriving Eq. (10), the statistical properties of n′(t) and n′′(t) are not aﬀected
by the carrier power. This accounts for the experimental observation that the
ampliﬁer phase noise given in rad2/Hz is about independent of power in a wide
range [HWB68, WFJ97, HHWW03]. Thus

Sϕ(f ) = b−1f

constant .

Of course, some dependence on P0 remains. We ascribe it to terms of order
higher than 2 in (7), and to the eﬀect of the large signal regime on the dc bias.

This occurs because the 1/f phase noise is about independent of power. Of
course, the ampliﬁers are supposed independent.

3.3 Phase noise spectrum

Combining white noise [Eq. (5)] and ﬂicker noise [Eq. (11)], there results the
spectral density Sϕ(f ) shown in Fig. 1. It is important to understand that the
white noise term b0f 0 depends on the carrier power P0, while the ﬂicker term
b−1f −1 does not. Accordingly, the corner frequency fc at which b−1f −1 = b0 is
a function of P0, thus fc should not be used to describe noise. The parameters
b−1, F , and P0 should be used instead.

4 Phase noise in feedback oscillators

4.1 The Leeson eﬀect

Figure 2 shows a model for the feedback oscillator, and its equivalent in the phase
space. All signals are the Laplace transform of the time-domain quantities, as a
function of the complex frequency s = σ + jω. The oscillator transfer function
is derived from Fig. 2 A according to the basic rules of linear systems

Stationary oscillation occurs at the angular frequency ω0 at which Aβ(jω) = 1,
= 1 and arg[Aβ(jω)] = 0. This is known as the Barkhausen
thus
condition for oscillation. At s = jω0 the denominator of H(s) is zero, hence
oscillation is sustained with zero input signal. Oscillation starts from noise or
> 1 (yet only slightly greater
from the switch-on transient if
than 1 for practical reasons). When the oscillation reaches a threshold ampli-
tude, the loop gain is reduced to 1 by saturation. The excess power is pushed
into harmonics multiple of ω0, and blocked by the resonator. For this reason,
at ω0 the oscillator operates in quasi-linear regime.

In most quartz oscillators, the sustaining ampliﬁer takes the form of a nega-
tive resistance that compensates for the resonator loss. Such negative resistance
is interpreted (and implemented) as a transconductance ampliﬁer that senses
the voltage across the input and feeds a current back to it. Therefore, the
negative-resistance oscillator loop is fully equivalent to that shown in Fig. 2.

This formula calls for the phase-space representation of Fig. 2 B, which deserves
the following comments.

(cid:20)

The Laplace transform of the phase of a sinusoid is probably the most com-
mon mathematical tool in the domain of PLLs [KF72, Gar79, Bes99, Ega98].
Yet it is unusual in the analysis of oscillators. The phase-space representation
is interesting in that the phase noise turns into additive noise, and the sys-
tem becomes linear. The noise-free ampliﬁer barely repeats the input phase,
for it shows a gain exactly equal to one, with no error. The resonator transfer

is known as the Leeson frequency. Equation (15) is proved in two steps:

1. Feed a Heaviside step function κU (t) in the argument of the resonator

input sinusoid. The latter becomes cos [ω0t + κU (t)].

2. Linearize the system for κ

0. This is correct in low phase noise condi-
tions, which is certainly our case. Accordingly, the input signal becomes
cos(ω0t)

κ sin(ω0t)U (t).

3. Calculate the Laplace transform of the step response, and use the prop-
erty that the Laplace transform maps the time-domain derivative into a
multiplication by the complex frequency s. The Dirac function δ(t) is the
derivative of U (t).

The full mathematical details of the proof are available in [Rub05, Chapter 3].

Figure 3: Oscillator phase noise spectra, not accounting for the output buﬀer.

The ampliﬁer phase noise spectrum contains ﬂicker and white noise, i.e.,
Sψ(f ) = (b−1)ampli f −1 + (b0)ampli. Feeding such Sψ(f ) into the Leeson formula
(14), the oscillator Sϕ(f ) can only be one of those shown in Fig. 3. Denoting with
fc the corner frequency at which ﬂicker noise equals white noise, we often ﬁnd
fL < fc in HF/VHF high-Q oscillators, and fL > fc in microwave oscillators.
In ultra-stable HF quartz oscillators (5–10 MHz), the spectrum is always of the
type A (fL < fc).

4.3 Resonator stability

The oscillator frequency follows the random ﬂuctuation of the resonator natural
frequency. However complex or tedious the formal proof for this statement can
be, the experimentalist is familiar with the fact that the quartz oscillator can
be frequency-modulated by a signal of frequency far higher than the Leeson
106 resonator
frequency. For example, a 5 MHz oscillator based on a Q = 2
shows a Leeson frequency of 1.25 Hz (see Table 2), while it can be modulated
by a signal in the kHz region. Additionally, as a matter of fact, the modulation
index does not change law from below to beyond the Leeson frequency. This
occurs because the modulation input acts on a varactor in series to the quartz,
whose capacitance is a part of the motional parameters.

4.4 Other eﬀects

The sustaining ampliﬁer of a quartz oscillator always includes some kind of feed-
back; often the feedback is used to implement a negative resistance that makes
the resonator oscillate by nulling its internal resistance. The input admittance
Yi seen at the ampliﬁer input can be represented as

Yi = Y (v)

i + Y (r)

i

,

(22)

that is, the sum of a virtual term (v) plus a real term (r). The diﬀerence
between ‘virtual’ and ‘real’ is that in the case of the virtual admittance the input
current ﬂows into the feedback path, while in the case of the real admittance
the input current ﬂows through a grounded dipole. This is exactly the same
concept of virtual impedance routinely used in the domain of analog circuits
[Fra97, Chapter 1]. The admittance Y (r)
also includes the the eﬀect of the
i
pulling capacitance in series to the resonator, and the stray capacitances of the
electrical layout. As a consequence, the ﬂuctuation δY (v)
is already accounted
for in the ampliﬁer noise, hence in the model of Fig. 2, while the ﬂuctuation
δY (r)
interacts with the resonator parameters,
i
thus δY (r)
yields frequency ﬂuctuations not included in the Leeson eﬀect. The

5 Analysis of the oscillator phase noise

This section address the core question, wether the 1/f 3 noise observed on the
oscillator Sϕ(f ) plot is due to the Leeson eﬀect, or it originates in the resonator.
The interpretation method is shown in Fig. 4, and discussed below.

1. We start from the spectrum, measured or taken from the oscillator spec-
iﬁcations. The ﬁrst step is to remove the residual of the mains (50 or 60
Hz and multiples) and other stray signals, and to ﬁt the spectrum with
the power-law [Eq. (3)]. This process is called parametric estimation of
the spectrum. With a pinch of experience, sliding old-fashion squares on
a A4-size plot gives unexpectedly good results. Otherwise, the mathe-
matical methods explained in [JW68, PW98] are useful. After this, the
spectrum looks like that of Fig. 4 A,

2. The term b0f 0 is chieﬂy due to the sustaining ampliﬁer, hence the ampliﬁer

input power can be calculated using Eq. (6)

P0 =

F kT0
b0

.

(23)

In the absence of information, it is wise to take F = 1.26 (1 dB). To the
extent of our analysis, estimating P0 is only a check of plausibility.

3. Feeding the oscillator b−3 term into Eq. (4), we calculate the ﬂoor of the
Allan deviation σy. We check on the consistency between calculated value
and speciﬁcations or measures, if available.

4. At ﬁrst sight, the cutoﬀ frequency f ′

L (Fig. 4 A) can be taken for the
Leeson frequency because there the slope changes from f −3 to f −1. Yet
the term b−1f −1 contains the ﬂicker of the sustaining ampliﬁer and of the
output buﬀer, which add [Equations (12) and (21)]. For this reason, f ′
L
can not be the Leeson frequency.

5. Actual oscillators have 2–4 buﬀer stages, the main purpose of which is
to isolate the feedback loop from the environment in order to ensure fre-
quency stability and to prevent injection locking. Owing to the Leeson
eﬀect, a wise designer will spend the lowest-noise technology in the sus-
taining ampliﬁer, rather than in the buﬀer. Thus, we assume that the
buﬀer contributes 3/4 of the total noise, and that sustaining ampliﬁer con-
6 dB). Accordingly, we plot the line b−1 a f −1 in Fig. 4 B,
tributes 1/4 (
−
6 dB below the total ﬂicker.

6. After taking away the buﬀer noise, the continuation of the b−3f −3 line
L. The latter is a new candidate for the
L into Eq. (17), we calculate the resonator

meets the b−1 af −1 line at f = f ′′

merit factor Qs (the subscript s stands for ‘spectrum’)

Qs =

.

fL =

,

7. Technology suggests a merit factor Qt (the subscript t stands for ‘technol-
ogy’) signiﬁcantly larger than Qs, even in actual load conditions. Feeding
Qt into Eq. (17), we calculate fL based on the actual merit factor

as shown in Fig. 4 C. There follows a phase noise term (b−3)L, which
account for the Leeson eﬀect alone.

8. Given Qt

Qs, thus fL

f ′′
L, the Leeson eﬀect is hidden. Consequently,
the oscillator f −3 phase noise is chieﬂy due to the ﬂuctuation of the res-
onator natural frequency.

This can be demonstrated from the b−3 term of the Leeson formula (14), using
Equations (4) and (17). The parameter R states how bad is the actual oscillator,
as compared to the same oscillator governed only by the Leeson eﬀect, with the
resonator ﬂuctuations removed. Thus, R = 1 (0 dB) indicates that the oscillator
f −3 phase noise comes from the Leeson eﬀect. Equal contribution of resonator
√2 is found when resonator
and Leeson eﬀect yield R = √2 (3 dB), while R
instability is the main cause of f −3 phase noise. In all cases we have analyzed,
discussed in the next Section, we ﬁnd R of the order of 10 dB, with a minimum
of 6.6 dB. This means that the Leeson eﬀect is hidden below the frequency
ﬂuctuation of the resonator.

≫

Coming back to the estimation of the 1/f noise of the sustaining ampliﬁer
it is to be remarked that if the 1/f noise of this is lower than 1/4 of the total
ﬂicker, f ′′
L is further pushed on the right hand on Fig. 4 B-C, which reinforces
the conclusion that the resonator is the main cause of frequency ﬂuctuation.

6 Experimental data and discussion

Figure 5 shows the phase noise spectrum of a 5 MHz oscillator, out of a small
series intended as the ﬂywheel for the space Cesium fountain clock Pharao
[LLS+01, BLA+04]. On this plot, the reader can follow the interpretation pro-
cess explained in Section 5, and illustrated in Fig. 4. Guessing on technology,

the merit factor was estimated to be 2

is less than 1/4 (
Table 2 shows the results of our analysis on some oscillators. The ability
to estimate the resonator merit factor is necessary to understand the oscillator
inside. Experience indicates that the product ν0Q is a technical constant of the
1013. As a matter
piezoelectric quartz resonator, in the range from 1
of fact, the highest values are found in the 5 MHz resonators. In load conditions,
the resonator merit factor is somewhat lower. The actual value depends on
frequency, on the designer skill, and on the budget for implementation. A bunch
of data are available from [GB85, Kro05, Wal95], and from our early attempts
to measure the resonator frequency stability [RGBG00]. The oscillators we
have analyzed exhibit the highest available stability, for we are conﬁdent about
published data. The Agilent 10811 (hence the Agilent prototype) is closer to
the routine production, and probably closer to the cost-performance tradeoﬀ,
as compared to the other ones, thus understanding oscillator the inside is more
diﬃcult. Nonetheless, in this case the value of Qs is so low that there is no
doubt that it can not be the resonator merit factor.

In the case of the Oscilloquartz 8607, the f −3 noise is too low for it to be
extracted from the Sϕ(f ) spectrum available on data sheet, which starts from
127 dBrad2/Hz,
|1 Hz =
1 Hz. Yet, we can use the device speciﬁcations Sϕ(f )

looking at the spectrum and at the Allan variance it is clear that at f = 1 Hz and
f = 10 Hz the terms b−3f −3 and b−1f −1 determine Sϕ(f ), with at most a minor
contribution of b0. It is also clear that Sϕ(f )
b0. Thus b−3 and b−1 are
obtained by solving a system of two equations like Sϕ(f ) = b−3f −3+b−1f −1+b0,
at 1 Hz and 10 Hz.

In the case of the Wenzel 501-04623 oscillator (Fig. 6), the speciﬁcations
available on the manufacturer web site consist of a few points, while the whole
spectrum is not published. Experience indicates that in the case of 100 MHz
oscillators the f −1 line tends to be hidden by the frequency ﬂickering. That
said, we can only guess that the f −1 noise of the sustaining ampliﬁer is similar
to that of other oscillators. This is suﬃcient to estimate f ′′
L, and to notice that
the merit factor Qs is far too low as compared to the state of the technology, and
to conclude that the f −3 phase noise is due to the ﬂuctuation of the resonator
natural frequency. It is to be remarked that the power at the ampliﬁer input
is of the order of 10–20 µW in all other cases, and of 1 mW here. In addition,
the 100 MHz resonator is smaller in size than the other resonator. A relatively
high frequency ﬂicker is therefore not surprising.

The examples shown above indicate that, under the assumption of Sec-
tions 3–4, the oscillator frequency ﬂickering is chieﬂy due to the ﬂuctuation
of the resonator natural frequency.

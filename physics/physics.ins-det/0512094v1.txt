Abstract

The gaseous Micromegas detector designed for the CERN Axion
search experiment CAST, operated smoothly during Phase-I, which
included the 2003 and 2004 running periods.
It exhibited linear re-
sponse in the energy range of interest (1-10keV), good spatial sensi-
tivity and energy resolution (15-19% FWHM at 5.9 keV) as well as
remarkable stability. The detector’s upgrade for the 2004 run, sup-
ported by the development of advanced oﬄine analysis tools, improved
the background rejection capability, leading to an average rate 5 · 10−5
counts/sec/cm2/keV with 94% cut eﬃciency. Also, the origin of the
detected background was studied with a Monte-Carlo simulation, using
the GEANT4 package.

Introduction

Axions are hypothetical, neutral, pseudo-scalar particles[1] that arise in the
context of the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem. Like neu-
tral pions they have a two-photon interaction and according to the Pri-
makoﬀ mechanism[2] they can transform into photons in external electric or
magnetic ﬁelds. Therefore, the Sun would be an axion source through the
transformation of thermal photons in the solar core. Actually, the expected
axion ﬂux on Earth and their spectrum has been calculated[3, 4] and is con-
ﬁned in the 1-10 keV interval. The detection of these particles is possible

1

in laboratory magnetic ﬁelds[5] by the reverse Primakoﬀ eﬀect and their
back-conversion into X-rays.

2 CAST

The CAST experiment (CERN Axion Solar Telescope) is designed to detect
solar axions or to improve the existing limits on their coupling to pho-
tons. The axion helioscope constructed at CERN uses a decommissioned,
superconducting LHC dipole magnet[6] which is 10m long and produces a
magnetic ﬁeld of 9T inside two parallel pipes. The magnet is mounted on a
rotating platform and its vertical movement allows the accurate observation
of the sun for about 3h during sunrise and sunset while the rest of the day
is devoted to taking background data. A possible excess signal in all three
diﬀerent X-ray detectors employed in CAST[7, 8] would be attributed to the
axion conversion process which is the only X-ray source through the magnet.
The operation of CAST has been divided in two phases in order to scan
the axion phase space (coupling to photons vs axion mass): during Phase I
the magnet pipes were kept in vaccum while in Phase II they will be ﬁlled
with buﬀer gas (He) to look for heavier axions.

3 The micromegas detector

The micromegas technology (MICRO-MEsh-GAseous Structure) was devel-
oped in mid 90’s in Saclay[9] and is based on a two stage parallel plate
avalanche chamber. A micromesh separates the conversion space (2-3 cm),
where the primary interaction takes place, from the ampliﬁcation gap (50-
100 µm) where charge multiplication up to 104 is easily achieved. Such a
gain is made possible due to the high electric ﬁeld applied in the ampliﬁ-
cation gap, while the large ﬁeld ratio allows for 100% electron transmission
through the mesh as well as the fast collection of positive ions (100-200
nsec). Moreover, the mesh plane is made of Copper and its allignment is
achieved by Kapton pillars spaced 1 mm apart.

The charge collection plane consists of 192 X and 192 Y strips, formed by
interconnecting pads on Kapton foil with 350 µm pitch and their readout is
based on Gassiplex chips[10]. Due to this two dimensional structure, excel-
lent spatial sensitivity is achieved which can be further improved, according
to the experimental needs, by appropriate choice of the strips’ size, the gas
mixture and the conversion gap[11].

Following the particular demands of the CAST experiment, the mi-

2

cromegas models used were ﬁlled with Argon/Isobutane mixture (95%-5%)
in atmospheric pressure and were supplied with an aluminized polypropy-
lene window (Fig.1), supported by a strong-back1. Also, the frame of the
detector was made of low natural radioactivity materials (plexiglas and plas-
tic) to reduce the background, while the chain of electronics was extended
by the installation of a high sampling VME Digitizing Board (MATACQ) to
record the time structure of the mesh pulses. It has 12 bit capacity and is
able to handle up to 300 MHz input signals with 2GHz sampling frequency,
while producing low noise (less than 0.2 mV rms).

4 Performance during Phase I

CAST Phase I has been succesfully completed and included two running
periods during 2003 and 2004, roughly from May to November. The 2003
data have been evaluated and the ﬁrst results have been published[12], while
the 2004 data analysis is still in progress.

2003 run

The V3 micromegas model was designed for the 2003 run of CAST, with
25 mm conversion space and 50 µm ampliﬁcation gap. However it was soon

realized that the strip structure had some faults, containing a few damaged
strips and giving rise to ”cross-talk” eﬀects.
In oreder to overcome the
problem and extract time information of the events, the MATACQ card
was installed and which permitted the succesfull operatiom of the detector
for the last thee months of the run. Everyday routine included calibration
measurement with 55F e source, tracking of the sun and accumulation of
background data2. The oﬄine analysis was based on sequential cuts on
pulses’ observables (risetime, width, height-integral correlation), utilizing
the calibration data and it has been possible to reduce the background rate3
to the average value of 1.4·10−4sec−1cm−2keV −1 in the 1-9 keV region with
80% and 95% cut eﬃciency at 3 keV and 5.9 keV respectively.

Moreover, the detector’s linear responce was veriﬁed (Fig.3) by using
109Cd source which produced ﬂuorescence of the device’s materials (Fig.2).
The energy resolution was 15% FWHM at 5.9 keV and the system’s stability
has been outstanding since the time characteristics of the mesh pulses as well
as the energy response variated less than 2% through the whole running
period.

2004 run

The experience acquired during the 2003 run led to the development of the
V4 model (30 mm conversion gap, 100 µm ampliﬁcation gap) which was
specially designed to eliminate the ”cross-talk” eﬀects present at the previ-
ous model and to improve the quality of the strips. As a result, both goals
were achieved4 and a faster MATACQ board was installed, reducing the
detector’s dead time to 14 msec (less than 1.5% of the net data rate) while
the energy resolution was 19% FWHM at 5.9 keV.

The oﬄine analysis was greatly improved by combining the information
from the spatial distribution of the charge produced after an event with the
time structure of the mesh pulses. More speciﬁcally, six observables (rise-
time, width, height vs integral correlation, X and Y strip multiplicity bal-
ance, X and Y strip charge balance, height vs total strip charge correlation)
were used in a Fisher discriminant method to distinguish more eﬃciently
the proper X-ray events from other signals. The resulting background re-
jection was 4.8 · 10−5sec−1cm−2keV −1 in the 1-8.5 keV region (Fig.4) with
94% uniform software eﬃciency.

The system’s stability is demonstrated through the mesh pulses’ time
structure (0.5% variation of risetime and width) and the moderate gain
variation (10% on a week scale) which was corrected with everyday calibra-
tion.

4The damaged strips were less than 1.3%.

Figure 4: 2004 background shape

In order to understand the origin of the measured background, the
GEANT4 package was used for a Monte-Carlo simulation. As a ﬁrst ap-
proach, the simulation included the responce of the detector to incident
particles without the full reconstruction of an event which can be achieved
by more specialised simulation toolkits. The ﬁrst results indicate that the
background is induced by environmental radioactivity5 and gamma radia-
tion which produce ﬂuorescence of the surrounding materials 6. It was also
revealed that the thermal neutrons present in the experimental site interact
via elastic scattering with the Ar atoms of the detector’s gas, the recoil of
which gives identical signal to an X-ray event. Other ionizing particles, such
as muons or electons are also detected but easily identiﬁed due to their non-
local energy deposition. The quantitative reproduction of the background
has not been possible because of limited knowledge about the rate and the
spectrum of the surrounding radiation but a detailed measurement has been
scheduled, which will be used in the CAST Phase II.

5 Conclusions and prospects

The micromegas technology has been employed for the construction of a
reliable X-ray detector matching the demanding requirements of CAST.
The expectation for low background and adequate stability throughout the
extended running periods of the experiment was completely met by mi-

Currently, a new micromegas detector is being developed in order to op-
erate during CAST Phase II with an X-ray focusing device. On the other
hand, Monte Carlo studies are under way to investigate the optimum shield-
ing needed for further reduction of the background.

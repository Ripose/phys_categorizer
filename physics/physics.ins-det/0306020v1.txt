The parametri formulas are obtained whereby the refrative index and the light group

veloity ould be alulated for any water state (salinity, pressure, temperature) inside of

the light wavelength region from 200nm to 1200nm. These formulas are suitable to be used

in underwater neutrino telesope ativity.

In underwater Cherenkov neutrino telesopes /1÷5/ water ats as a radiator of

Introdution

Cherenkov photons generated by harge partiles. Cherenkov photons are emitted

in one with half-angle defined by the mass and momentum of the partile and the

refrative index of the medium (water in our ase)

cosΘ = 1/(β · n(λ)),

where β is veloity of partile, n(λ) is refrative index and λ is wavelength.

Beause the medium (water) is disperseve, the group veloity (veloity of light

signal transmission in transparent material) is different from phase veloity

vph(λ) = c/n(λ) and being haraterised by a group index of this medium

vgr(λ) = c/ngr(λ),

ngr(λ) = n(λ) − λ · (dn/dλ),

where c is the light veloity in vauum.

This reality is taken into aount for example in onstrution of a large-area Time

Of Flight(TOF) ounters. The group index of sintillator is ngr = 1.75 ompared
with refrative index n = 1.5 /6/. In the DUMAND-type installation ativity a

phase veloity was used for estimation of a photon TOF till it was demonstrated

/7/ that suh approah leads to errors in results of TOF-alulations. For photon

passed through 100m water layer these errors vary from 10ns to 18ns when the light

wavelength varies from 500nm to 350nm. A disregard of the vgr − vph differene does

not affet errors in trak reonstrution for the existing projets /8/, but, as Baikal

Neutrino Telesope experiene shows, only vgr must be used for time-alibration of

the detetor modules with the help of an outside laser and its value have to be known

with a quite high auray.

The measurement of the group veloity may be performed with a help of detetor

modules lighted by an outside laser whih shines through water /9/. Comparison

of the experimental result with the value of this physial onstant gives an unique

possibility to verify the auray and reliability of all time measuring units and all

auray of vgr alulation have to be higher than this level and therefore all fators
whih affet the ngr value (wavelength dependene, temperature, pressure, salinity)

must be taken into aount.

1. Dispersion formulas for pure and sea water

In applied optis a alulation of a refration index for any wavelength in the

restrited wavelength region is performed using so alled dispersion formulas. These

formulas have the same struture for different lass of material but differ usually in the

formula oeffiients. Thus for example for optial olourless glass in the wavelength

interval 365÷10139 nm the following formula is used /10/:

n2 = A1 + A2 · λ2 + A3 · λ−2 + A4 · λ−4 + A5 · λ−6 + A6 · λ−8,

(4)

where Ai are the oeffiients of the dispersion formula, whih depend on the glass
lass and eah lass is haraterised by one's own set of Ai /10/.

There is abundane of table data/10-12/ whih ontain the results of the refra-

tion index measurements performed for pure (salinity S=0

0/00 ) water, atmospheri
pressure P = Patm and temperature t = 200C . The formula (5) represent the best fit

to these data and the lower solid line 1 on Fig.1 shows the result of the refration

index alulation by means of this expression. The points on this line orrespond to

table data used in the fitting proedure.

The sets of the same blak points whih are also shown in Fig.1 orrespond to the

sets of the table data /12/ for different states (S, P, t) of sea water. The dependenies

n versus λ for these sets are desribed by funtions

n(λ, S, P, t) = n0(λ, S0, P0, t0) + △n(S, P, t)

(6)

with quite high preision. The last fat permits to onlude, that in distint with

an optial glass, the dispersion formula oeffiients are the same for distilled water,

sea water and ompressed water and they do not depend on temperature. Thus to

alulate a refration index of any water for any wavelength the dispersion formula

(5) may be used as an universal one and just S, P, t -orretions (△n(S, P, t)) must

be taken into aount whih do not depend on wavelength.

2. S, P, t -orretions of water refrative index

is the speifi refrative index. If we suppose that the right part of the expression (7)

is onstant, the hange in refrative index with density is given by

△n
△ρ

=

(n2 + 2) · (n2 − 1)
6 · n · ρ

,

and alulation of △ρ(S, P, t) is enough for the estimation of △n(S, P, t).

Analysis of table data/12/ shows some dependene Rρ versus t and versus S

and so the desribed approah beomes not quite orret. Diret omparison of the

measured inreasing △ nexp whih ours due to water temperature fall from 20

are used as fully as possible and the formula (9) may be used, if suh results are not

available, but only for △np orretion, when density is hanged diretly due to the

pressure inreasing. To alulate the orretions it is supposed that

△n(S, P, t) = △nSt(S, P0, t) + △np(S, P, t).

(10)

The refrative index table data whih have been measured for sea water /12/ were

used to get some mathematial expressions to desribe the dependenies n versus S , t
and P . The points on Fig. 2 orrespond to sea water refrative index values measured
under atmospheri pressure for photons with λ = 583.9nm /12/ and the lines are

alulated using the expression (11), whih is the best fit to these points:

n(S, P0, t) = 1.3340 + 0.19705 · 10−3 · S−

−(0.15655 + 0.010045 · S − 0.41077 · 10−4 · S2) · 10−4 · t−
−(0.17585 − 0.14300 · 10−2 · S + 0.12525 · 10−4 · S2) · 10−5 · t2.

(11)
Beause of the salinity varies inside the region (35 ± 4)0/00 in projets planned to

be installed in a deep sea, the table data /12/ are used whih ontain refrative index

values (λ = 501.7nm) measured under high pressure in water with S = 350/00 . These

points for whih the sea depth values (h(m)) are used instead the pressure values

are shown on Fig. 3 and dependene of the refrative index versus h and versus t is

desribed well by the expression (12) :

n(35, h, t) = 1.3448 + 0.15024 · 10−5 · h − 0.13122 · 10−10 · h2−

−(0.50560 + 0.80127 · 10−4 · h − 0.99739 · 10−9 · h2) · 10−4 · t−
−(1.3118 − 0.11469 · 10−3 · h + 0.18712 · 10−8 · h2) · 10−6 · t2.

The expressions (11) and (12) may be used to alulate (S, t)-orretion and Ph -

orretion orrespondingly :

(9)

0

0

(12)

(13)

△nSt = n(S, P0, t) − n(0, P0, t0),

4

△np = n(35, Ph, t) − n(35, P0, t).

A pure water ompressibility is higher than the one for salt water and, therefore,

aording (9) one has △np(0, P, t) > △np(S, P, t). To aount it (in the absene of

diret experimental data) the depth orretion for pure water may be alulated as

△np(0, Ph, t) = △np(35, Ph, t) · KS,

4. Comparison with the experimental result

The first diret measurements of the light (λ=475nm) signal veloity (V ) have been

performed in the water volume of Baikal Neutrino Telesope (NT-200) /9/. These

measurements did not require any add devies and any hanges in NT-200 standard

regime. Data of usual laser alibration run has been used to do this. During suh

runs NT-200 Channels (Ch) detet the flashes of laser, whih has attahed to NT-

200 entral string on 20m lower than the lowest Ch. Laser generates five flash series

with the dereased photon intensity. Only entral string data have been taken into

aount to avoid the influene of the neighbour strings o-ordinates ambiguities. Mean

measured values of Time Differene(Tij ) for any of two Ch's (45 pairs in the total) and

the (measured before) spaes between Ch's attahment points and laser attahment

point were used as an input information. Inreasing of Ch time delay with the laser

flash intensity dereasing (time walk effet) was observed for all Ch's. The speial

proedure /9/ was applied to ompensate an influene of this effet on the final result.

Analysis of the V -distributions measured for different Sij = Si −Sj (Si is the distane
from laser to Chi ) has demonstrated no dependene of mean veloity values < V >
on Sij (Fig 5A). For seletion riterion Si − Sj > 12.5 m the expeted value of the

laser signal veloity

V = (2.178 ± 0.014) · 1010cm/s

had been obtained using data of 30 pairs of Ch's whih satisfy this riterion (Fig 5B).

This result is omparable with predited value 2.1919·1010

not agree with the phase veloity value. To verify an influene of salinity, pressure

and temperature on veloity the preision of measurements has to be inreased.

Next more extensive and more preise measurements have been done with the

experimental string developed near NT-200 site to test new deep underwater teh-

niques /14/. Light Beaons supplied short flashes with fixed photon intensity were

used as light soures in these measurements. UV(λ =370 ± 6 nm),blue (λ =470 ±

were deteted by four standard NT-200 Channels attahed to experimental string.

laboratory) and the distanes between light soure and Channels (31m, 34m, 58m,

5. Summary and onlusion

The measured properties /10÷12/ of the water refrative index as funtions of
light wavelength(λ), salinity(S), pressure(P) and temperature(t) have been employed

in the performed analysis as fully as possible.

The struture of dispersion formula for water was applied whih is similar with

dispersion formula struture for an optial glass /10 /. This struture was used to

desribe susesfully (see formula (5) and Fig.1) the experimental refrative index

dependene on the light wavelength in the interval (200÷1250)nm for distilled water
C and P=Patm /10÷12/. The polynomial using/14/ gives true result only
in the interval (300÷600)nm (see Fig.1) in whih Cherenkov light ontributes to the

0

with t=20

signal of a muon.

Analysis of the extensive table data /12/ shows that formula (5) may be also

suessfully used (see fig. 1) for water with other properties (S, P, t) just by means

adding some orretion △nSP t(S, P, t) whih does not depend on λ.

The assumption is used that equality △nSP t=△nSt+△nP is suffiiently true in

the onsidered ase, and these orretions are omputed for any water states using

expressions (11÷15).

To simplify alulations of the light group veloity the suitable formula (16) has

been seleted whih quite satisfatorily desribe the omputed group veloity values

in the light wavelength interval 200÷1250 nm (see Fig. 4).

The omparison of the group veloity value alulated for Baikal Neutrino Tele-

sope site with the results of in situ measurement /9, 14/ demonstrates good agree-
ment, the distintions do not exeed one standard deviation (∼ 0.7% of measured

value) /9/ and 0.4 standard deviation /14/ while the differene between alulat-

ed phase veloity value and the measured light veloity amounts to four standard

8

deviations. Moreover the results /14/ permit to onfirm a validity of △vgr (S, P, t)

estimations (see Fig.4).

The obtained parametri expressions (5), (6), (10÷16) ould be used to alulate

a veloity of monohromati light signal for alibration of TOF system by means of

a power laser lighting through water. These expressions are also suitable for using in

simulation of events detetion and in reonstrution proedure for existed Underwater

Neutrino Telesope projets and for future 1km3

Neutrino Telesopes /13/.

Preface

This report describes the GLD detector outline for International Linear Collider. The
study was initiated by the call for Detector Outline Documents by World Wide Study of
Physics and Detectors for Future Linear Colliders in 2004, following the international con-
sensus for joint eﬀorts to realize International Linear Collider (ILC).

ILC provides collision between electron and positron at the energy scale where the origin
of masses and the true nature of vacuum are expected to be uncovered and new particles
relevant to cosmology may also be discovered. With their initial states both in energy and he-
licity well deﬁned and background processes low in general, it provides unique opportunities
to discover tiny signals of new particles and unveil the underlining physics.

Progresses of high energy physics have established a modern view of ultra-microscopic

×

SU(2)

world; three generations of elementary fermions belonging to the group of SU(3)
×
U(1) with their forces being governed by the gauge principle. Particle masses are considered
to be generated by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of SU(2)
U(1) symmetry which
is cause by the yet-to-be-found Higgs boson. According to current understanding, it is
expected that the Higgs boson will be discovered at LHC. And if found, precise knowledge
of its properties such as mass and couplings to particles are crucial for our understanding
of vacuum and mechanism of mass generation. The presence of the Higgs boson, however,
poses a new problem known as the hierarchy problem. It indicates that there may exist new
physics at TeV scale where SUSY is one candidate thereof.. Also, the standard model does
not provide candidates for the dark matter which is thought to account for about one quarter
of the mass of universe. Recent studies suggest that the dark matter particle based on the
SUSY scenario may be found in the ILC energy region. The goal of the GLD experiment is
to carry out these measurements at precisions only possible at ILC.

×

In order to perform this physics program, the detector should have unprecedented preci-
sion in measurements of jets and charged particles, eﬃcient quark identiﬁcation capability,
and should have a good hermetic coverage of the interaction point. Through detector studies
for linear collider in Asia, Europe, and North America, we have developed a detector con-
cept that consists of a large calorimeter and a gaseous central tracker placed in a moderate
magnetic ﬁeld, both electro-magnetic and hadron calorimeters being placed inside the mag-
netic coil to have enough hermeticity and good jet energy resolution. Details of the detector
concept as well as expected performances are described in the following chapters.

The study of GLD concept was kicked oﬀ at the time of 7th ACFA workshop, November
2004. The group is formed as an inter-regional team lead by contact persons, two from
each region; Hitoshi Yamamoto, Hwanbae Park from Asia, Ron Settles, Mark Thomson
from Europe, Mike Ronan from Europe and Graham Wilson from North America. Since the
kickoﬀ, the concept has been developed and benchmarked through e-mail communications,
at TV meetings and a series of meetings held at workshops such as 8th ACFA workshop,
Snowmass2005, ECFA workshop at Vienna. Those who joined the GLD mailing list are
listed as authors of this document. Optimizations of detector parameters and studies of
detector technologies are still in progress and this document is to summarize the current

status of our study. New participation to our activity is highly welcomed. The home page
of the group is available at http://ilcphys.kek.jp/gld.

Description of the Concept

1.1 GLD Concept

1.1.1

Introduction

The physics gaol of the International Linear Collider (ILC) project ranges over a wide variety
of processes in a wide energy region of √s from MZ to 1 TeV [1, 2, 3].
In experiments
at the ILC, it is essential to reconstruct events at fundamental particle (leptons, quarks,
and gauge bosons) level. Most of interesting physics processes include gauge bosons (W
or Z), heavy ﬂavor quarks (b and c), and/or leptons (e, µ, τ ) as direct products of e+e−
collisions or as decay daughters of heavy particles (SUSY particles, Higgs boson, top quark,
etc.). The detectors at the ILC have to have capability of eﬃcient identiﬁcation and precise

In order to achieve these performances, we propose a large detector model based on a large
gaseous tracker, named “GLD”.

1.1.2 Basic Design Concept of GLD

The basic design of GLD has a calorimeter with ﬁne segmentation and large inner radius to
optimize it for “Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA)”. Charged tracks are measured by a large
gaseous tracker, presumably a Time Projection Chamber (TPC), with excellent momentum
resolution. The TPC also has good pattern recognition capability which is advantageous for
eﬃcient reconstruction of V 0 particles such as K 0, Λ, and new unknown long-lived particles,
and for eﬃcient matching between tracks measured by the TPC and hit clusters in the
calorimeter. The solenoid magnet is located outside of the calorimeter. Because the detector
volume is huge, a moderate magnetic ﬁeld of 3 Tesla has been chosen.

Jet energy resolution is one of the most important issues for ILC detectors. Precise mass
reconstruction and separation of W and Z in their hadronic decay mode are essential in many
physics channels. The PFA (Particle Flow Algorithm) is a method to get the best jet-energy
resolution. In this method, each particle in a jet is measured separately; charged particles by
the tracker, photons by the EM (electromagnetic) calorimeter ECAL, and neutral hadrons by
the hadron calorimeter HCAL. The ultimate PFA performance can be achieved by complete
separation of charged-particle hit clusters from neutral hit clusters in the calorimeter. Actual
jet energy resolution is dominated by a contribution from confusion between charged and
neutral clusters. Optimization of algorithm and calorimeter design for PFA is necessary
to get better jet energy resolution. In all three detector concepts (SiD, LDC, and GLD),
optimization for PFA is the major concern.

In order to avoid the confusion and to get good jet energy resolution, separation of
particles in the calorimeter is important. Therefore, the calorimeter should have a small
eﬀective Moliere length, ﬁne segmentation, and a large distance from the interaction point.
Stronger solenoid ﬁeld is preferable to spread out the charged particles more. The ﬁgure of
in/Reﬀ
merit which is often quoted for the cluster separation in ECAL is expressed as BR2

The iron return yoke and barrel calorimeters have dodecagonal shape (24-sided shape for the
outside of HCAL) rather than octagonal shape in order to reduce unnecessary gaps between
the muon system and the solenoid, between HCAL and the solenoid, and between TPC and
ECAL.

In addition to the baseline conﬁguration, the following options are being considered.
Silicon tracker between TPC and EM calorimeter in the barrel region is proposed to improve
the momentum resolution still more. It is also suggested that a TOF counter in front of the
EM calorimeter can improve the particle identiﬁcation capability, but this function could be
included in the EM calorimeter.

MDI (Machine Detector Interface) issues, as well as the physics requirements, give impact
on the detector design. Beam background has to be taken into account for the design of
ILC detectors. The beam pipe radius and inner radius of the vertex detector of GLD have
been determined based on the consideration of pair background (see Section 2.1). The
conﬁguration of FCAL and BCAL of GLD has been chosen so that the back-scattered photons
produced by the dense core of pair background at BCAL do not hit the TPC drift volume
directly.

There are three options for the beam crossing angle; 2 mrad, 14 mrad, and 20 mrad.
In case of 20 mrad crossing angle, a dipole magnetic ﬁeld could be implemented inside the
detector in order to cancel the transverse ﬁeld component of the solenoid magnet for the
incoming beam and make the electron and positron beams collide vertically head-on. This

dipole ﬁeld could be produced by a so-called detector-integrated dipole (DID). Because DID
doubles the transeverse ﬁeld component for the outgoing beam, it could cause a background
problem in SIT due to backscattering from BCAL. In case of 14 mrad crossing angle, use
of anti-DID which has reverse polarity of the DID is considered to make the beams collide
vertically head-on. In this case, SIT is free from the backscattering problem.

Another parameter which aﬀects the detector design is L∗, the distance between the
interaction point and the front surface of the ﬁnal quadrupole magnet. We assume a large
L∗ for GLD (L∗ = 4.6 m).

Time structure of the ILC beam gives impact on the requirment for the performances of
some sub-detectors. Figure 1.4 shows the time structure of the ILC beam. In the nominal
option of the ILC accelerator design, 2820 bunches of electrons and positrons make a train
with 307.7 ns time intervals between bunches, and the trains are repeated at a rate of 5 Hz.
In order to untangle the event overlap in one train, bunch-identiﬁcation (time stamping)
capability is necessary for the silicon trackers and calorimeters.

The parameters of the detector and the sub-detector technologies of GLD are modiﬁed
from time to time based on considerations on the detector performance, development of
more realistic detector design, considerations on cost issue, requirements from accelerator
It is unrealistic to do the simulation study again and again for every
side, and so on.
modiﬁcations. Therefore the detector model implemented in the detector simulator does not
necessarily reﬂect all the modiﬁcation of the baseline design. In this report, the detector
model assumed in Chapter 3 (Sections on the performance) is based on an older version than
what is described in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2. The cost estimation will be done based on
the baseline design described in this section.

1.1.4 Overview of Sub-detectors

In this subsection, we will describe each sub-detector very brieﬂy. The detail of the detector
sub-system will be described in Chapter 2. The parameters of the sub-detectors are listed in
Table 1.1 for trackers and in Table 1.2 for calorimeters. The parameters listed in this table
are based on the latest baseline design and not necessarily consistent with the parameters
given in Part 3 (Table 3.1).

Vertex Detector

Very good impact parameter resolution for charged tracks is required at ILC for eﬃcient
jet-ﬂavor identiﬁcation. The target value of the impact parameter resolution is

10
pβ sin3/2 θ
In order to achieve this resolution, the Si pixel vertex detector has to have excellent point
resolution and thin wafer thickness.

σb = 5

(µm).

⊕

For the baseline design of the vertex detector, we envisage ﬁne pixel CCDs (FPCCDs) as
the sensors. The inner radius is 20 mm and the outer radius is 50 mm. It consists of three
layers of doublets where a doublet is made by two sensor layers with 2 mm distance.

In FPCCD option, pixel occupancy is expected less than 0.5% for the inner most layer
(R=20 mm) at B=3 T for the ILC nominal machine parameters [5]. The hit density is,
however, as high as 40/mm2. Therefore, very thin wafer (much less than 100 µm) is required
in order to keep wrong-tracking probability due to multiple scattering reasonably low [6].
The R&D eﬀort on the wafer thinning is very important, as well as the fabrication of the
small pixel sensors.

Silicon Trackers

Silicon Inner Tracker

The silicon inner tracker is located between the vertex detector and main tracker.

It

consists of the barrel inner tracker (BIT) and the forward inner tracker (FIT).

The roles of the barrel inner tracker are to improve the linking eﬃciency between the main
tracker and the vertex detector, and to reconstruct and measure momenta of low pt charged
particles. Time stamping capability to separate bunches (307.7 ns or 153.8 ns interval) is
necessary as well as good spatial resolution.

Silicon strip detectors will be used for the BIT. Four layers of silicon strips are being
considered for stand-alone tracking capability. The innermost and outermost layers of the
BIT are located at the radii of 9 cm and 30 cm, respectively.

Forward silicon tracker (FIT) should cover the angular range down to

150 mrad which
corresponds to the coverage of the endcap calorimeter. The technologies used for the FIT
depends on the track density of jets and the background level (beam background and 2-
photon background). Detailed simulation study is necessary to determine the technology.
We assume silicon pixel sensors for the ﬁrst three layers and silicon strip sensors for the other
four layers.
Silicon Endcap Tracker

∼

Several layers of silicon strip detectors are placed in the relatively large gap between the
TPC and the endcap EM calorimeter. This endcap silicon tracker (ET) improves momentum
resolution for charged particles which have small number of TPC hits. Another role of the
ET is to improve matching eﬃciency between TPC tracks and shower clusters in the EM
calorimeter. This function is important particularly for low momentum tracks.

Main Tracker

A large gaseous tracker will be used for GLD as the main tracker. In the baseline design,
a TPC (Time Projection Chamber) with 40 cm inner radius and 200 cm outer radius is

CHAPTER 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE CONCEPT

assumed. The maximum drift length in z-direction is 230 cm.

The requirement for the performance of the TPC in GLD is to achieve the momentum

t < 5

TPCs have been used in a number of large collider experiments in the past and have
performed excellently. These TPCs were read out by multi-wire proportional chambers
(MWPCs). The thrust of R&D is to develop a TPC based on novel micro-pattern gas de-
tectors (MPGDs), which promise to have better point and two-track resolution than wire
chambers and to be more robust in high backgrounds than wires. Systems under study at
the moment are Micromegas[7] meshes and GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier)[8] foils. Both
operate in a gaseous atmosphere and are based on the avalanche ampliﬁcation of the pri-
mary produced electrons. The gas ampliﬁcation occurs in the large electric ﬁelds in MPGD
microscopic structures with sizes of the order of 50 µm. MPGD lend themselves naturally to
the intra-train un-gated operation at the ILC, since, when operated properly, they display a
signiﬁcant suppression of the number of back-drifting ions.

Calorimeter

As mentioned in Section 1.1.2, the calorimeter of GLD should have large radius and ﬁne 3D
segmentation in order to get excelent jet energy resolution by PFA. The target value of the
jet energy resolution is

σ(Ej)/Ej = 30%/

Ej(GeV ).

q

EM Calorimeter

The EM calorimeter (ECAL) should have small eﬀective Moliere length in order to sup-
press the shower spread and minimize the deterioration of the jet-energy resolution due to
confusion of γs and charged tracks. For this reason, tungsten will be used for the absorber
material.

Because the size of EMCAL is quite large (

100 m2/layer), it may not be practical to use
∼
silicon pad as the sensor due to cost. Therefore, the baseline design adopts scintillator strips
or tiles with wavelength-shifter ﬁber readout. As the photon sensor, the use of MPPC (Multi-
Pixel Photon Counter) is considered. It consists of 30 sampling layers of tungsten/scintillator
with the thicknesses of 3 mm/2 mm and 1 mm gap for readout. The eﬀective segmentation
cell size is 1 cm
Hadron Calorimeter

1 cm with orthogonal strips.

×

The hadron calorimeter (HCAL) of GLD, as a baseline design, consists of 46 layers of
lead/scintillator sandwiches with 20 mm/5 mm thickness and 1 mm gap for readout. This
conﬁguration is thought as a “hardware compensation” conﬁguration which gives the best
energy resolution for a single particle. The eﬀective cell size is 1 cm square to be achieved
by 1 cm x 20 cm strips and 4 cm x 4 cm tiles. As the photon sensor, the use of MPPC is
considered to read scintillating lights through a wave length shifting ﬁber. Another option
of “digital hadron calorimeter” is also considered for HCAL so as to reduce the cost of read
out electronics. For the digital HCAL, the base line design consists of scintillator strip may
have shower overlap problem. With a realistic PFA model, we need to clarify this, so as to
determine the optimal width and length of the strips.
Forward Calorimeters

CHAPTER 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE CONCEPT

9

The forward calorimeter of GLD consists of two parts: FCAL and BCAL. The z-position
of FCAL is close to that of endcap ECAL, and it locates outside of the dense core of the pair
background in R direction. BCAL is located just in front of the ﬁnal quadrupole magnet
4.5 m). The inner radius of FCAL and BCAL depends on the machine parameters. In
(
∼
case of small crossing angle of 2 mrad, the inner radius of the BCAL can be as small as
20 mm and the minimum veto angle for the electrons of 2-photon processes is

5 mrad.

Since BCAL is hit by the dense core of the pair background, it creates a lot of backscat-
tered e± and photons. A mask made by low-Z material with the same inner radius as the
BCAL should be put in front of BCAL to absorb low energy backscattered e±. The z-position
of FCAL should be chosen so that FCAL works as a mask for the backscattered photons
from BCAL and they cannot hit TPC directly.

Technology of FCAL and BCAL is still open question. For FCAL, W/Si sampling
calorimeter will work well. For BCAL, more radiation hard sensors, such as diamond, would
be the option.

∼

Muon System

The muon detector of GLD is not required to work as a tail catcher, because calorimeters of
GLD has the thickness close to 7 interatcion length which is thick enough to contain hadron
showers. Therefore, the baseline design of GLD has just 9 or 10 layers of muon detectors
interleaved with the iron return yoke, each layer being consists of two-dimensional array of
scintillator strips with wavelength-shifter ﬁber readout by MPPC.

Detector Magnet and Structure

The detector magnetic ﬁeld is generated by a super-conducting solenoid with correction
winding at both ends. The radius of the coil center is 4.0 m and the length is 8.9 m.
Additional serpentine winding for the detector integrated dipole (DID) might be necessary to
compensate the radial component due to ﬁnite crossing angle. The integrated ﬁeld uniformity
at the tracker region with this conﬁguration satisﬁes

without DID. This value is good enough for TPC. The total size of the iron structure has a
height of 15.3 m and a length of 16 m. The thick iron return yoke is required to keep leakage
ﬁeld low enough. The requirement for the leakage ﬁeld from the accelerator side is less than
50 Gauss on the beamline at z = 10 m.

Data Aquisition

The main goal of the data acquisition (DAQ) system is to take data of interesting events
eﬃciently in the presence of several orders of magnitude higher backgrounds. Although the
minimum bias event rates are expected to be lower than the hadron colliders, the data size
will be large due to the huge readout channels to measure physics processes with the required
accuracy. The bunch structure of the ILC operation conditions leads to the proposal of an
event building system without any hardware trigger and of some pipelinings to achieve a
dead-time free DAQ system.

CHAPTER 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE CONCEPT

Since the DAQ system depends on the ﬁnal design and also on the rapid development of
the technologies, the system presented here is still conceptual, showing possible options and

In GLD, K/π separation can be achieved to some extent by dE/dx measurement in the
TPC. Recently dE/dx resolution better than 3% was suggested using “digital TPC”. If this
resolution is realized, we will have a fairly good eﬃciency in K/π separation above 2 GeV/c.
However, there is an eﬃciency gap between 0.9 GeV/c and 2 GeV/c in K/π separation by
dE/dx. This gap can be ﬁlled by TOF measurement in front of ECAL with a resolution of
100 ps. If eﬃciency loss due to this gap is non-negligible, the ﬁrst layer of ECAL should

Introduction

10/pβ sin θ3/2 µm, the vertex detector
In order to achieve the performance goal of σb = 5
should have very thin layer thickness (< 100 µm/layer) and small inner radius. Compared
with other two detector concepts, GLD has relatively low magnetic ﬁeld of 3 T (LDC and
SiD have 4 T and 5 T, respectively). The impact of the magnetic ﬁeld on the vertex
detector design is the radius of the innermost layer. Higher magnetic ﬁeld conﬁnes the pair-
background in a smaller radius, and the beam pipe and the vertex detector can be put closer
to the beam line. So the GLD vertex detector has to have slightly larger inner radius RV T X
to keep background hit density same as other detector concepts.

⊕

At ILC, 2820 bunches of electron and positron beam make collisions successively with
307.7 ns bunch intervals. This succession of 2820 bunches is called “train”, and trains are
repeated at a rate of 5 Hz. Due to low energy electron/positron beam background, the
1.5 hit/cm2 at
hit rate of the innermost layer of the vertex detector is estimated to be
R=2.0 cm and B=3 T for one bunch crossing (BX). If the hits are accumulated for one train,
the hit density becomes very high, and the pixel occupancy for a pixel detector with 25 µm
pixel size exceeds 10%, which is not acceptable.

∼

One method to keep the pixel occupancy acceptable level (

0.5%) is to read out the
sensors more than 20 times in one train. Another method is to increase the number of pixels
20 useing very ﬁne pixels. In this ﬁne pixel option, the data can be read out
by factor of

Fine Pixel CCD

As the vertex detector for the ILC experiment, a lot of sensor technologies are proposed but
non of them seems to be demonstrated to work satisfactorily at ILC. For the moment, we
assume ﬁne pixel CCD (FPCCD) option for the baseline design of the GLD vertex detector.
It does not mean that the standard pixel options are rejected for GLD, of course.

For the FPCCD vertex detector [10, 11], we use very ﬁne (

5 µm) pixel CCDs. By
increasing the number of pixels by a factor of about 20 compared with standard pixel sensors,

the pixel occupancy will be less than 1% even if the hit signal is accumulated during a whole
train of 2820 bunches. In order to suppress the number of hit pixels due to diﬀusion in the
epitaxial layer, the sensitive layer of the FPCCD has to be fully depleted.

A big challenge of the FPCCD vertex detector is the high hit density due to pair-
background hits. Although the pixel occupancy is satisfactorily low, the hit density is as
high as 40 hits/mm2 at B=3 T and R=20 mm with the machine parameter of the “nominal
option” [5]. This high hit density could cause tracking ineﬃciency if the multiple scattering
eﬀect is large. When a signal hit candidate on a layer is searched for by extrapolating sig-
nal hits of outer layers, the background hits cause misidentiﬁcation probability pmis. For a
normal incident track, pmis is given by

pmis = 2πσR2
0,
R0 = dθ0

(2.1)

where σ is background hit density of the inner layer, d is the distance between inner and
outer layers, and θ0 is the multiple scattering angle by the outer layer. The angular and
4 θ, where p is the momentum and θ is the
2 sin−
momentum dependence of pmis is pmis ∝
polar angle.

p−

The misidentiﬁcation probability for 1 GeV/c particles is plotted as a function of cos θ
in Figure 2.1 assuming the layer thickness of 50 µm Si. As can be seen from this ﬁgure,
misidentiﬁcation probability quickly goes up in the forward region. If the distance between
inner two layers is 10 mm, pmis is nearly 30% at cos θ = 0.95 with the background hit
density of 40/mm2. To reduce the misidentiﬁcation probability, the distance between inner
two layers should be small. If the distance is 2 mm, pmis is as small as the case of d = 10 mm
and σ = 2/mm2, which is expected when the sensor is read out 20 times per train.

Another way to reduce pmis more is background rejection using hit cluster shape of the
FPCCD. The momentum spectrum of the pair-background particles hitting the innermost
layer of the vertex detector has a peak around 20 MeV/c at 3 T magnetic ﬁeld. Therefore,
the incident φ angle of background particles to the sensor plane is quite diﬀerent from that
of large pt signal particles. As a consequence, the hit clusters of background particles have
larger spread in φ direction and smaller spread in z direction than what is expected for the
large pt particles as shown in Figure 2.2. Background rejection of about factor 20 is expected
for large cos θ region where the misidentiﬁcation probability becomes large [11].

Layer Conﬁguration

The baseline design of the vertex detector is schematically shown in Figure 2.3. Two sensor
layers put in proximity make a doublet to reduce the misidentiﬁcation probability. CCD
wafers will be thinned down to 50 µm and glued on both sides of 2-mm-thick plates made
of rigid foam such as reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam or silicon carbide (SiC) foam.

The density of RVC can be as small as 3% of graphite, which corresponds to 0.016%X0 for
1 mm thickness.

The angular coverage is cos θ < 0.9 with 6 barrel layers and cos θ < 0.95 with 4 barrel
layers plus 2 forward-disk layers. Because we need end-plates with sizable material budget
to support barrel laddes, the role of the forward-disk layers may be less important for low
momentum tracks. The whole ladders are supported from outer shell made by berylium or
CFRP, and conﬁned in a cryostat made by low-mass material (polystyren foam for example).
The CCDs are operated at low temperature in order to keep dark current and charge transfer
ineﬃciency due to radiation damage reasonably low.

The inner radius of the vertex detector is determined by a consideration on beam back-
ground. We have estimated the possible smallest radii of the beam pipe and the innermost
layer of the vertex detector based on a simple model. The model we have used is shown in
Figure 2.4. The minimum radii of the beam pipe and the ﬁrst layer of the vertex detector
were determined using following design criteria:

•

The dense core of the pair background should not hit the beam pipe. It should have
2 mm clearance at the junction of the central

5 mm clearance at z = 350 mm and

∼
beryllium part and the conical part.

•

The silicon wafer is 2 mm longer than what is required to cover

|

|

The ladder length is longer than the silicon wafer by 15 mm. The clearance between
the ladder and the conical part of the beam pipe is 2 mm.

The simulation for pair background was done using CAIN for various ILC parameter
sets. The track density of the pair background in z-r plane is shown in Figure 2.5 with
the nominal ILC parameter set [5] and crossing angle of 2 mrad for 3, 4, and 5 T magnetic
ﬁeld. Figure 2.6 shows the track density distribution for high luminosity option of ILC
parameters [5]. The distribution of the dense core of the pair-background tracks with the
original high luminosity option is signiﬁcantly broader than that with the nominal option.
Recently, A. Seryi proposed new high-luminosity parameter sets [12]. These new high lumi-
nosity parameter sets give less and narrower pair background as can be seen from Figure 2.6.

The beam-pipe parameters and minimum radius of the vertex detector RV T X determined
by the design criteria and the background simulation described above are summarized in
Table 2.1. We can see that minimum RV T X strongly depends on the machine parameter
option.

From this study, we choose the radii of Be beam pipe (RBe) and innermost layer of the
vertex detector (RV T X) as 15 mm and 20 mm, respectively, as the baseline. We also con-
sidered two options for diﬀerent background conditions as listed in Table 2.2. The baseline
conﬁguration can be used even for High-Lum-A1 option at 1 TeV. The “small-R” conﬁgu-
ration can be used only for the nominal machine option at 500 GeV, and somewhat risky.
The “large-R” conﬁguration is compatible with the high luminosity option at 500 GeV.

Signal Readout

Each wafer of the FPCCD will have multi-port readout in order to reduce the readout time
and to reduce the eﬀect of charge transfer ineﬃciency (CTI) caused by radiation damage.
A readout ASIC consisting of ampliﬁers, correlated double samplers, and analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) will be put on both ends of a ladder. Because the FPCCD option can
achieve an excellent spatial resolution even with digital readout, few bits will be enough for
the ADCs.

The data size of the vertex detector is dominated by the contribution from the pair-

background hits. The total number of pixels is as large as
pixel data is consisted of 34 bit address plus 5 bit analog data, the data size for 1% pixel
occupancy becomes about 5 Gbits per train. Actually the pixel occupancy of the outer layers
is much less than 1%, and the dada size will be much smaller than this vaue. The data size
derived from the expected number of hits for the nominal option of the machine parameters
is less than 0.5 Gbits per train. Therefore, a small number of optical ﬁber cables with few
Gbps throughput will be enough for the data transfer.

2.1.3 Possible Options

In this report, we assume FPCCD as a technology for the vertex detector of the baseline
GLD design, but this is just an assumption. There are a lot of candidate technologies studied
all over the world. The options are; column parallel CCD (CPCCD), CMOS monolithic
active pixel sensor (MAPS), depleted FET (DEPFET), pixel sensor based on SOI technology
(SOI), CMOS pixel sensor with registers in each pixel (CAP/FAPS), in-situ storage image
sensor (ISIS), and ﬁne pixel CCD (FPCCD). Among them, CAP, FAPS, ISIS, and FPCCD
accumurate the signal during a train and are read out in between trains.

The R&D eﬀorts for these technologies will be continued for several years. The technology
choice for the vertex detector in future will be done by real “collaboration groups” of the
ILC experiment based on the results of the R&D.

2.1.4 R&D needed

Development of sensors and demonstration of their performance satisfying the requirements
as the vertex detector for ILC experiments are the highest priority R&D issues for all sensor
technologies. Study of wafer thinning technique and development of their support structure
are also indispensable. Other R&D items are; development of the front-end readout ASIC,
minimization of power consumption, data compression and the back-end electronics, cooling
system with minimum material, and development of thin beam pipe.

2.2 Silicon Inner Tracker

2.2.1 Detector Features

The silicon inner tracker (SIT) is considered to improve a momentum resolution and recon-
struction eﬃciency of long-lived particles with the vertex detector and help pattern recog-
nition in linking the tracks found in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with the tracks
found in the vertex detector. The SIT consists of the barrel inner tracker (BIT) in the barrel
region and the forward inner tracker (FIT) in the endcap region. Four cylindrical BIT layers
are located between the vertex detector and the TPC (Figure 1.3).

The four layers will consist of the double-sided silicon strip detectors with 10 µm spatial
resolution in rφ direction. Seven plane disks perpendicular to the beam direction are po-
sitioned as the FIT. The four inner planes with any pixel-based sensors and the remaining
three planes with silicon strip detectors (modest resolution) are being considered. The SIT
design of the BIT and the FIT is shown in Figure 2.7.

(BIT) and seven planes in the endcap (FIT).

Some of key mechanical parameters associated with the BIT and FIT design are listed

The multiple Coulomb scattering is dominant in the low momentum region and addition

of the SIT does not help to improve the momentum resolution.

Figure 2.9 shows the momentum resolution as a function of the momentum for the diﬀer-
ent number of layers in the SIT and the simulation result shows that four layers is reasonable
choice to achieve the required momentum resolution.

The linking and reconstruction eﬃciency of charged tracks from physics events should be
studied. Since the angular resolution in the detector performance is important in the endcap
regions, the polar angular resolution as a function of the polar angle should be studied. This

mass energy is given by error on collinearity distribution of Bhabha events.

2.2.3 Technologies

The Double-sided Silicon Strip Detector (DSSD) will be used for the BIT and 10 µm resolu-
tion in rφ is required. The SIT consist of 4 layers of DSSD. Since z measurement is needed to
improve the track ﬁnding eﬃciency, 50 µm resolution in z is largely suﬃcient. The physical

n+ strips with 50 µm pitch, and 511 p+ strips with 100 µm pitch. This type of the DSSD
sensors [15] are already used for the silicon vertex detectors in high energy experiments [16].
The inner four planes and the outer three planes of the FIT will consist of pixel and
strip detectors, respectively. Among the silicon pixel sensor technology, ATLAS pixels with
a pixel of 50 µm
300 µm can be used [13]. The requirements of the strip detectors for the
FIT are somewhat loose compared with those for the BIT. 25 µm resolution is required and
this resolution can be achieved with a strip pitch of 100 µm and a readout pitch of 300 µm.

2.2.4 Detector Conceptual Designs

Figure 2.10 shows a conceptual layout of a possible mechanical support structure. In this
design we have to consider that the SIT is not only mechanically very rigid but also as thin
as possible. The readout electronics will be located at the very end of the BIT layers in
order to minimize the material in front of the TPC. The SIT is mechanically independent of
the TPC and the whole TPC can be withdrawn from the detector.

In a recent measurement it has been shown that the Lorentz angle in silicon causes a
broadening of the clusters of about 180 µm for electrons and about 40 µm for holes for 300
µm thick detectors and a magnetic ﬁeld of 3 T if the strip are parallel to the B-ﬁled. Not to
be limited by this eﬀect one has to use the p-side of the detectors for the rφ-measurement
and the n-side for z. Table 2.5 shows parameters in the conceptual design of the BIT.

detectors of 0.5 cm2 are bonded to a detector chip allowing great ﬂexibility in the layout
of the modules.
In the strip planes of the FIT the strip disks are preferably built with
double-sided detectors to minimize the material. The material budget as a function of the
polar angle up to the end of the SIT is shown in Figure 2.11

2.2.5 R&D Program and Needed

The R&D program of the DSSD with DC-type is ongoing and AC-type is just started. Also
single sided silicon strip sensors are under study. The DC-type of DSSD design is as follows.
The sense strips on one side of the layer are orthogonal to the ones on the other side. This
way one plane measures x and y coordinates of point, where ionizing particle goes through,
on its two diﬀerent sides [14]. The p-side has two metal layers; one layer for implantation
strip and one for readout strip. The each of sensor side consists of 512 sensor strips with
50 µm and 100 µm pitch on n-side and p-side, respectively. Each strip is bias strip and the
readout pads are made large for bonding. The sensor size has an area of 13.3 cm2 and 2.6
cm long readout strips.

Two batches of 25 wafers were processed in ETRI [17] on 127 mm diameter, FZ, 380 µm
thick, <100>-oriented, n-type silicon wafers, with resistivity of > 5 kΩcm. A total of 11

masks steps were needed for the sensor fabrication process: 5 and 6 masks for n-side and
p-side, respectively. To make the junction depth of the n -side deeper we started with n+
implantation and then p+ implantation is followed and Si3N4 instead of SiO2 is employed
as the isolation material at the second batch run. Figure 2.12 shows pictures of the n-side
and p-side of the fabricated double-sided silicon strip sensors which are fabricated in 5-inch
fabrication line in Korea. The leakage current and capacitance of the prototype strip sensor
is being measured. It shows that the leakage current level of the single strip sense is from
8nA
20nA up to the full depletion voltage and values of the bulk leakage current level and
the capacitance are about 1 µA and 50 pF, respectively. This measurement provides us
information of the bulk characteristics and quality of the fabricated sensor.

−

We used 90Sr beta source for the radioactive source test purpose. After the full depletion
voltage was applied for the prototype, we measured the beta source signal with test readout
electronics. We measured noise level of the silicon sensor without the beta source and the
beta source is then put on the top of the silicon sensor in a dark box. The beta source signal
was clearly seen and signal to noise is obtained to be 25 as shown in Figure 2.13.

The full R&D of the AC-type of DSSD and single sided silicon strip is necessary. Also
comparison between the DC-type and AC-type should be done. The VA-chip was used for
current R&D for the front-end readout electronics. However, it can’t be used for the ILC

suppression and back-end electronics need to be studied.

2.3 Main Tracker

A Time Projection Chamber is chosen as central tracker for the GLD detector concept at
the ILC. An R&D program is underway to develop the technology and prove the feasibility
of a high-performance TPC required for this application. The use of new micro-pattern gas
devices (MPGD) is an attractive possibility for the gas ampliﬁcation. The decision for using
an MPGD device, either the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) or the Micromegas technique,
has included a comparison with the multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) technology
used in past TPCs in a number of large collider experiments. For future TPCs, the MPGD
technology promises to have better point and two-track resolution than wire chambers and
to be more robust in high backgrounds.

2.3.1 The Basic Concept of the LC-TPC

General arguments for a TPC as main tracker are as follows.

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

The tracks can be measured with a large number of (rφ,z) space points, so that the
tracking is continuous and the eﬃciency remains close to 100% for high multiplicity
jets and in presence of large backgrounds.

It presents a minimum of material to particles crossing it. This is important for getting
the best possible performance from the electromagnetic calorimeter, and to minimize
103 beamstrahlung photons per bunch crossing which traverse
the eﬀects due to the
the detector.

∼

The comparatively moderate σsinglepoint and double-hit resolution are compensated by
the continuous tracking and the large volume which can be ﬁlled with ﬁne-granularity
coverage.

The timing is precise to 2ns (corresponding to 50 µm/ns drift speed of tracks hooked up
to the z-strips of a silicon inner detector with 100µm pitch), so that tracks from diﬀerent
bunch crossings or from cosmics can readily be distinguished via time stamping.

To obtain good momentum resolution and to suppress backgrounds near the vertex,
the TPC has to operate in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. It is well suited for this environment
since the electrons drift parallel to ~B, which in turn improves the two-hit resolution

Non-pointing tracks, e.g.
cle ﬂow measurement and help in the reconstruction of physics signatures in many
standard-model-and-beyond scenarios.

The TPC gives good particle identiﬁcation via the speciﬁc energy loss, dE/dx, which
is valuable for many physics analyses, electron-identiﬁcation and particle-ﬂow applica-
tions.

The TPC will be designed to be robust and at the same time easy to maintain so that
an endplate readout chamber can readily be accessed or exchanged in case of accidents
like beam loss in the detector.

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

25

Two additional properties of a TPC will be compensated by proper design.

•

•

The readout endplanes and electronics present a small but non-negligible amount of
material in the forward direction. The goal is to keep this below 30%X0.

compensated by designing for the ﬁnest possible granularity: the sensitive volume will
109 3D-electronic readout voxels (two orders of magnitude better
consist of several
than at LEP). It has been estimated to result in an occupancy of the TPC of less
than 0.5% from beam backgrounds and gamma-gamma interactions[2]. (See below for
further discussion.)

2.3.2 Design issues.

There are many aspects for the layout of the LC detector and its subdetectors. The detector
has to be designed globally to cover all possible physics channels, and the roles of the
subdetectors in reconstructing many of these channels are highly interconnected. For the
TPC, the issues are performance, size, endplate, electronics, gas, alignment and robustness
in backgrounds.

Resolution expected/needed

This resolution is achievable with inner-silicon tracking and a TPC performance given
in Table 2.6. If for physics reasons, the overall tracking accuracy should be better, a larger
TPC and/or more silicon layers should be envisaged[18].

Endplate

As stated in the introduction, MPGDs are the default technologies for the gas ampliﬁcation
since they promise better performance than the MWPC. Systems mainly under study are
Micromegas [7] meshes and GEM [8] foils. Both[19] operate in a gaseous atmosphere and
are based on the avalanche ampliﬁcation of the primary produced electrons. The gas am-
pliﬁcation occurs in the large electric ﬁelds within the MPGD microscopic structures with
sizes of the order of 50µm. MPGDs lend themselves naturally to the intra-train un-gated
operation foreseen for the ILC, since, when conﬁgured properly, they display a signiﬁcant
suppression of the number of back-drifting ions. In addition a gating plane will be foreseen
for inter-train gating in order to have a safety factor in case of unexpected backgrounds (see
below).

The two TPC endplates have a surface of about 10 m2 of sensitive area each. The layout
of the endplates, i.e. conceptual design, stiﬀness, division into sectors and dead space, has
been started, for instance as shown in Figure 2.14. In this example the question arises as

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

27

correlated design tasks related to the endplates. As stated in Section 2.3.1, the material
budget for the endcap and its eﬀect on ECAL for the particle-ﬂow measurement in the
forward direction must be minimized. More details are covered in the next item.

Electronics

For the readout electronics, one of the important issues is the density of pads that can be
accommodated while guaranteeing a thin, coolable endplate. The options being studied are
(a) a standard readout (meaning, as in previous TPCs) of several million pads or (b) a pixel
readout of a few hundred times more by using CMOS techniques.
(a) Standard readout:
Pad sizes under discussion are, for example, 2 mm times 6 mm (the TDR size[2]) or 1 mm
times 6 mm which has found to be better as a result of our R&D experience (see below). A
preliminary look at the FADC-type approach using 130 nm technology indicates that even
smaller sizes like 1 mm times 1 mm might be feasible (in which case charge-spreading would
not be needed). In all of these cases there are between 1.5 and 20 million pads to be read
out. An alternative to the FADC-type is the TDC approach (see [20][21]) in which time
of arrival and charge per pulse (via time over threshold) is measured. In case the material
budget requires larger pads, then the resistive-foil technique[22] is an option to maintain the
point resolution.
(b) CMOS readout:
A new concept for the combined gas ampliﬁcation and readout is under development. In
this concept[20] the MPGD is produced in wafer using post-processing technology on top of
a CMOS pixel readout chip, thus forming a thin integrated device of an amplifying grid and
a very high granularity endplate, with all necessary readout electronics incorporated. This
concept oﬀers the possibility of pad sizes small enough to observe individual single electrons
formed in the gas and count the number of ionization clusters per unit track length, instead
of measuring the integrated charge collected. Initial tests using Micromegas[23] and GEM
foils[24] mounted on the Medipix2 chip provided 2-dimensional images of minimum ionizing
track clusters. A modiﬁcation of the Medipix2 chip (called Timepix) to measure also the drift
time is under development[21]. Also a ﬁrst working integrated grid has been produced[25].

Chamber gas

This issue involves (a) gas choice, (b) ion buildup and (c) ion feedback.

(a) Gas Choice
The choice of the gas for a TPC is an important and central parameter. Gases being
investigated are variations of standard TPC gases, e.g.,
Ar(93%)CH4(5%)CO2(2%)–“TDR” gas,
Ar(95%)CH4(5%)–“P5” gas,
Ar(90%),CH4(10%)–“P10”,
Ar (90%)CO2(10%),
Ar (95%)Isobutane(5%) and
Ar(97%)CF4(3%).

When choosing a gas a number of requirements have to be taken into account. The
σsinglepoint resolution achievable in rφ is dominated by the transverse diﬀusion, which should

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

28

be as small as possible. Simultaneously a suﬃcient number of primary electrons should be
created for the point and dE/dx measurements, and the drift velocity at a drift ﬁeld of a
few times 100 V/cm should be about 5 cm/µs or more. The hydrogen component of hy-
drocarbons, which traditionally are used as quenchers in TPCs, have a high cross section
for interaction with low energy background neutrons which will be crossing the TPC at the
ILC[2]. Thus the concentration of hydrogen in the quencher should be as low as possible, to
minimize the number of background hits due to neutrons. An interesting alternative to the
9 cm/µs
traditional gases is a Ar-CF4 mixture. These mixtures give drift velocities around 8
at drift ﬁeld of 200 V/m, have no hydrocarbon content and have a reasonably low attach-
ment coeﬃcient at low electric ﬁelds. However at intermediate ﬁelds (
5-10 kV/cm), as
are present in the ampliﬁcation region of a GEM or a Micromegas the attachment increases
drastically, thus limiting the use of this gas to systems where the intermediate ﬁeld regions
are of the order of a few microns. This is the case for Micromegas, but its use has not been
tested thoroughly for a GEM-based chamber. Whether CF4 is an appropriate quencher for
the LC TPC is not yet known and is being tested as a part of our R&D.

(b) Ion Build-up
Ion build-up at the surface of the gas-ampliﬁcation plane and in the drift volume.

•

At the surface of the gas-ampliﬁcation plane vis-a-vis the drift volume, during the
bunch train of about 1 ms and 3000 bunch crossings, there will be few-mm thick layer
of positive ions built up due to the incoming charge, subsequent gas ampliﬁcation and
ion back drift. An important property of MPGDs is that they suppress naturally the
back drift of ions produced in the ampliﬁcation stage. This layer of ions will reach
a density of some fC/cm3 depending on the background conditions during operation.
Intuitively its eﬀect on the coordinate measurement should be small since the drifting
electrons incoming to the anode only experience this environment during the last few
mm of drift. In any case, the TPC is planning to run with the lowest possible gas gain,
meaning a few times 103, in order to minimize this eﬀect.

•

In the drift volume, a positive ion density due to the primary ionization will be built up
during about 1s (the time it takes for an ion to drift the full length of the TPC), will be
higher near the cathode and will be of order fC/cm3 at nominal occupancy (
0.5%).
The tolerance on the charge density will be established by our R&D program, but a
few ⁀ fC/cm3 is orders of magnitude below this limit.

∼

(c) Ion back drift and gating

In order to minimize the impact of ion feeding back into the drift volume, a required back
drift suppression of about 1/gasgain has been used as a rule-of-thumb, since then the total
charge introduced into the drift volume is about the same as the charge produced in the
primary ionization. Not only have these levels of back drift suppression not been achieved
during our R&D program, but also this rule-of-thumb is misleading. Lower back drift levels
will be needed since these ions would drift as few-mm thick sheets through the sensitive
region during subsequent bunch trains. Even if a suppression of 1/gasgain is achieved, the
overall charge within the sheets will be the same as in the drift volume so that the density
of charge within a sheet will be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the primary

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

29

ionization in the total drift volume. How these sheets would aﬀect the track reconstruction
has to be simulated, but to be on the safe side a back drift level of << 1/gasgain will be
desirable. Therefore, since the back drift can be completely eliminated by a gating plane,
a gate should be foreseen, to guarantee a stable and robust chamber operation. The added
amount of material for a gating plane is small, < 0.5%X0 average thickness. The gate will
be closed between bunch trains and remain open throughout one full train. This will obviate
the need to make corrections to the data for such an “ion-sheets eﬀect” which could be
necessary without inter-train gating.

The ﬁeld cage

The design of the ﬁeld cage involves the geometry of the potential rings, the resistor chains,
the central HV-membrane, the gas container and a laser system. These have to be laid out
for sustaining at least 100kV at the HV-membrane and a minimum of material. Important
aspects for the gas system are purity, circulation, ﬂow rate and overpressure. The ﬁnal
conﬁguration depends on the gas mixture, which is discussed above, and the operating
voltage which must also take into account the stability under operating conditions due to
ﬂuctuations in temperature and atmospheric pressure. For alignment purposes (see next two
items) a laser system will be foreseen, either integrated in the ﬁeld cage[26] or not[27].

Eﬀect of non-uniform ﬁeld

Br

Non-uniformity of the magnetic ﬁeld of the solenoid will be by design within the tol-
dz < 2mm used for previous TPCs. This homogeneity is achieved by
erance of
corrector windings at the ends of the solenoid. At the ILC, larger gradients could arise
from the ﬁelds of the DID (Detector Integrated Dipole) or anti-DID, which are options
for handling the beams inside the detector in case a larger crossing-angle optics is cho-
sen. This issue was studied intensively at the 2005 Snowmass workshop[28], where it
was shown that the TPC performance will not be degraded if the B-ﬁeld is mapped
4 relative accuracy and the calibration procedures outlined in Section 2.3.2 are
to 10−
followed. Based on past experience, the ﬁeld-mapping gear and methods should be
able to accomplish this goal. The B-ﬁeld should also be monitored since the DID or
corrector windings may diﬀer from the conﬁgurations mapped; for this purpose the
option a matrix of hall plates and NMR probes mounted on the outer surface of the
ﬁeld cage is being studied.

Non-unformity of the electric ﬁeld can arise from the ﬁeld cage, back drift ions and
primary ions. For the ﬁrst, the ﬁeldcage design, the non-uniformities can be minimized
using the experience gained in past TPCs. For the second, as explained above, the
back drift ions can be minimized at the MPGD plane using low gas gain and elimi-
nated entirely in the drift volume using gating. The eﬀect due to the third, the primary
ions, is due to backgrounds and is irreducible. As discussed above, the maximum al-
lowable electrostatic charge density has to be established, but studies by the STAR
experiment[30] indicate that up to 1 pC/cm3 can be tolerated, whereas at nominal oc-
cupancy it will be of order fC/cm3. This will be revisited by the LC TPC collaboration
by simulation and by the R&D program below.

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

30

Calibration and alignment

The tools for solving this issue are Z peak running, the laser system, the B-ﬁeld map, a
matrix of hall plates and NMR probes and the silicon layers outside the TPC. In general
about 10/pb of data at the Z peak will be suﬃcient during commissioning to master this
task, and typically 1/pb during the year may be needed depending on the background and
energy of the ILC machine. A laser calibration system will be foreseen which can be used to
understand both magnetic and electrostatic eﬀects, while a matrix of hall plates and NMR
probes may supplement the B-ﬁeld map. The z coordinates determined by the silicon layers
inside the inner ﬁeld cage of the TPC were used in Aleph[31] for drift velocity and alignment
measurements, were found to be extremely eﬀective and will thus be included in the LC TPC
planning. The overall tolerance is that systematics have to be corrected to 30µm throughout
the chamber volume in order to guarantee the TPC performance, and this level has already
been demonstrated by the Aleph TPC[28].

Backgrounds and robustness

The issues here are the primary-ion charge buildup (discussed above) and the track-ﬁnding
eﬃciency in the presence of backgrounds, which will be discussed here. There are back-
grounds from the accelerator, from cosmics or other sources and from physics events. The
main source is the accelerator, which gives rise to gammas, neutrons and charged particles
being deposited in the TPC at each bunch crossing[32]. Preliminary simulations of these
under nominal conditions[2] indicate an occupancy of the TPC of less than about 0.5%. This
level would be of no consequence for the LC TPC performance, but caution is in order here.
The experience at LEP was that the backgrounds were much higher than expected at the
beginning of the running (year 1990), but after the simulation programs were improved and
the accelerator better understood, they were much reduced, even negligible at the end (year
2000). Since such simulations have to be tuned to the accelerator once it is commissioned,
the backgrounds at the beginning could be much larger, so the LC TPC should be prepared
for much more occupancy, up to 10 or 20%. The TPC performance at these occupancy lev-
els will hardly deteriorate due to its continuous, high 3D-granularity tracking which is still
inherently simple, robust and very eﬃcient with the remaining 80 to 90% of the chamber.

2.3.3 R&D Program

To meet the above goals and to better understand the technologies, a number of institutes[29]
have joined together as LC-TPC groups, with the goal of sharing information and experi-
ence in the process of developing a TPC for the linear collider and of providing common
infrastructure and tools to facilitate these studies.

The R&D goals are as follows:

Operate MPGDs in small test TPCs and compare with MWPC gas ampliﬁcation to
prove that they can be used reliably in such devices.

Investigate the charge transfer properties in MPGD structures and understand the
resulting ion backﬂow.

Study the behavior of GEM and Micromegas with and without magnetic ﬁelds.

of the LC-TPC groups[29]. This work is providing a basic evaluation of the properties
of a MPGD TPC and demonstrating that the requirements outlined at the beginning
of this section can be met.

and in a test beam in a 1.2T magnet at KEK (right).

An example, the small-prototype TPC tests at KEK.

To provide a comparison and explore the potential improvements using MPGDs a small
prototype chamber, initially with an MWPC endplate, was built at the Max-Planck-Institut
f¨ur Physik at Munich. This chamber was commissioned at MPI, tested using cosmics at
DESY in their 5T magnet and subsequently was exposed to many beam tests at KEK using
MWPC, GEM, Micromegas and resistive-foil technologies. The chamber will be called MPT,
for MultiPrototype-TPC, in the following.

The MPT is shown in Figure 2.15. For the MWPC version, the MPT had signiﬁcantly
reduced wire-to-wire and wires-to-pads spacing to increase the achievable resolution and two-
track separation. The wire readout consisted of a plane of sense wires with a 20µm diameter
and spaced with a 2mm pitch. The sense-wire plane was placed 1 mm above the pad plane
onto which the signal was induced. Potential wires as used in previous TPC to deﬁne the
structure of the electrostatic cell around the sense wire did not exist in this chamber. The
pads were readout by the Aleph TPC electronics.

resolution and was measured from using the behavior of signal-charge spread as a function of
drift distance. The point resolution is naively parameterized by σrφ =

and compared with Monte Carlo simulation, preliminary results have been presented at
recent conferences related to the ILC and the ﬁnal results will be published in the near
future.

2.4 Calorimeter

2.4.1

Introduction

The ﬁnal state in the next generation electron positron collider, ILC, will be dominated by
the jets. At the high energy collisions, collimated multi-jets will emerge as the ﬁnal states
of quark, gluon and weak bosons. As we search for fundamental particles and interactions,
the intrinsic interactions must be clariﬁed from the ﬁnal jets environment. The aim of the
detector is to identify and separate the source of each jet. The collimated jet makes the
detector conﬁguration diﬃcult to separate the particles in a jet, so that ﬁne granularity is
required. The information of jet-particle interactions in the calorimeter will help to resolve
a jet. Not only the transverse granularity but also the longitudinal ﬁne segmentation is
indispensable. The larger the detector, the easier to resolve jet-particles. Thus the large
detector makes the things simpler with less probability of overlapping of particle clusters.
In order to resolve jet, the most important detector is the calorimeter by using PFA. With
the help of PFA, one can analyze the jet components by ECAL for gamma contents and by
HCAL for neutral hadron contents. The precision of jet energy determination is one of the
measure of the calorimeter. The jet energy resolution is expressed as a sum of charged ,
gamma and neutral-hadron components.

In Figure 2.16, these three resolutions are compared as a function of momentum or energy. At
the lower momentum region, resolution for charged particle by tracker is much smaller than
that for photons and neutral hadrons by calorimeter. Thus we can neglect the contribution
from the charged particles in the resolution. Here the momentum resolution assumed is

The ideal jet energy resolution is about 17.5 %. It is shown that the jet energy resolution
is dominated by the energy resolution of neutral hadrons, although the average energy of
neutral hadron is as small as 10 % in a jet. There is another more important factor to
deteriorate the jet energy resolution. That is the shower overlapping of multi-particle jet.
As the energy of jet is bigger, the overlapping eﬀect becomes more serious. The overlapping
eﬀect might be reduced by optimizing the detector segmentation and layer. It should be
clariﬁed by hadron simulation, however, there are no reliable simulator. We have to make
a prototype to test these simulators. There is an eﬀect of neutron which will give delayed
signal after the jet production, due to the slow neutron generated from hadronic interaction
in the HCAL. The neutron may carry some part of jet energy.
In order to measure the
neutron contribution in jets , we need proton rich active material to be sensitive against the
neutrons.

ECAL is used to measure photons precisely. HCAL is placed behind ECAL to measure
neutral hadrons. In order to obtain the high jet energy resolution by PFA, both ECAL and
HCAL need to have ﬁner granularity than those employed for recent experiments such as
LEP and LHC. The photon shower in ECAL and neutral hadron shower in HCAL should be

are measured at the front surface of ECAL (R = 210 cm) with their distances. This distance
is in the horizontal axis. The incident π0 momentum are 4, 10, 20 and 50 GeV. It is found
that the π0 of 50 GeV or less energy can be detected separately with the granularity of 1 cm

separated and distinguished from neighboring charged particles. The shower clustering algo-
rithms and ﬁne granularity are crucial to realize this performance. However, developments
of algorithms are in progress, and the granularities of calorimeters are yet to be optimized.
The average distance of two photons from π0 decay is plotted as a function of incident
momentum for GLD ECAL in Fig 2.17. It is shown that at least the size of the minimum
detector cell is smaller than 1 cm up to 50 GeV π0. On the other hand, neutral hadron
clustering is diﬃcult, since it would contain some hadrons whose interaction length is much
longer than radiation length for electromagnetic shower case. The cluster size of HCAL
becomes bigger than the ECAL. This indicates rather bigger segmentation allowed for HCAL,
as far as the algorithms works ﬁne with respect to ECAL case.

2.4.2 Electromagnetic calorimeter

Baseline design

In order to optimize the GLD detector concept for the Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA), the
electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter is required to have:

Large inner radius to separate particles with each other,

Small eﬀective Moliere radius to resolve near-by EM showers, and

Fine granularity both in transverse and longitudinal directions.

•

•

•

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

37

We propose a tungsten-scintillator sandwich calorimeter to fulﬁll these requirements.
Tungsten is chosen as the absorption material because of its small Moliere radius (9 mm).
Scintillator is chosen as the active detector material. The scintillator is read out by the
tile/ﬁber technique ﬁrst used for the CDF plug upgrade EM calorimeter. The tile/ﬁber
system has the following features:

Essentially crack-less hermeticity,

Capability for very ﬁne longitudinal segmentation,

Capability for ﬁne transverse segmentation, and

Less expensive than silicon pads.

•

•

•

•

The last item is important to realize a very large EM calorimeter. A layer of the EM
calorimeter has a 3 mm thick tungsten layer, a 2 mm thick scintillator layer, and a 1 mm
thick space for services, resulting in one-layer thickness of 6 mm and an eﬀective Moliere
radius of 18 mm. Both barrel and endcaps of the EM calorimeter have 30 such layers,
corresponding to a total thickness of 26X0.

We have two options to realize ﬁne transverse segmentation.

1. Strip array: This is the baseline conﬁguration where a scintillator layer is composed
of short strips. A super-layer is schematically shown in Figure 2.18, where two tungsten
layers and two scintillator layers (X- and Y -layers) make a super-layer. The scintillator
strips in X- and Y -layers are arranged to orthogonal with each other. The width of the
strips is 1 cm, about a half of the eﬀective Moliere radius of the EM calorimeter. This
1 cm. To suppress
strip array is expected to have an eﬀective granularity of 1 cm
ghost images which may appear when multi-particles hit a small area of the strip array,
strips should not be long. The strip length is tentatively 4 cm and will be optimized
by simulation studies.

×

2. Small tiles: This is a backup solution. A scintillator layer is composed of small square
tiles. This conﬁguration is free from the ghost image problem but has less granularity
2 cm, and will

×

The number of the scintillator strips/tiles amounts to about 10 millions. To keep the
ﬁne granularity, signals of all the strips (tiles) must be individually read out. Photons from
each scintillator strip (tile) are read out via a WLS ﬁber embedded in its straight groove. A
very compact photon detector such as SiPM1/MPPC2 is directly attached to the WLS ﬁber

The electric signals of the photon detectors are then transported with thin ﬂex cables to
the calorimeter end where the signals are digitized. To keep the cost of the EM calorimeter
reasonable, the photon detectors and readout electronics must be cost-eﬀective.

2.4.3 R&D studies

Test beam results of strip-array ECAL

An EM calorimeter test module, made of scintillator strips and lead plates, was constructed
and tested with beam at KEK-PS [35]. The purpose of the test beam was to study EM
shower development extensively as well as to evaluate the performance of the energy, position
and angle measurements for incident electrons.

The test module (Figure 2.20) consisted of 24 sampling layers, each of which had a lead

PMTs per super-layer which was deﬁned as four successive X- or Y -layers. In the beam test,
a tracking system was placed upstream of the calorimeter in order to reconstruct a track of
the incident particle.

was evaluated. The energy resolution (sigmaE/E ) was found to be ((13.10

the uniformity results were 2.4% for the shorter (1 cm-width) direction and 1.5% for the
longer (20 cm-length) direction. With electron beams, the uniformity of the total energy
measurement was found to be 1.1 %.

The lateral shower proﬁles were also studied in detail. We introduced I(x), which was
deﬁned as the energy deposit integrated between minus inﬁnity and x, divided by the total

Figure 2.22 shows the I(x) distributions of each of the superlayers for 4 GeV/c electrons
and that of the second superlayer for MIPs. The spread of the MIP signal mainly originated
from light leakage between strips and cross-talks in the multi-anode PMT. On the other
hand, the spreads for electrons mostly came from the EM shower spread in the calorimeter.
Taking into account these detector eﬀects, we can reproduce the spreads for the electron and
also the expected eﬀective Moli`ere radius of 27 mm with the GEANT simulation.

Absorber plates

As a test sample, a tungsten-alloy plate with a dimension of 200 mm
produced by a Japanese company. Instead of pure tungsten, tungsten-alloy (W:Ni:Cu=95.0:3.4:1.6)
was used for much easier manufacturing and handling. The density of the tungsten-alloy
was 18.20 g/cm3 and the degree of hardness was 310 Hv. As the uniformity of the absorber
material is important for good energy resolution, the thickness of the plate was measured at
many points using a digital micrometer. The result is shown in Figure 2.28. The average,
minimum, and maximum thickness was 3.016 mm, 3.006 mm, and 3.032 mm, respectively,
and the RMS was 0.007 mm (0.23 %). If the uniformity of the thickness can be kept at this
level, the eﬀect to the energy resolution should be negligible.

Scintillator strips/tiles

Small plastic scintillators of diﬀerent sizes, thickness and wrapping reﬂectors are systemat-
ically studied. A 16-channel photomultiplier tube (PMT) is used as read out through the
1.0 mm and 1.6 mm diameter wavelength shifting (WLS) ﬁber. The scintillating light gen-
erated by particles from the collimated 90Sr source is collected from the scintillator by the
WLS ﬁber and converted into electrical signals at the PMT. The best light yield scintillator
2 mm2 strip scintilla-
is determined by comparing the measured pulse height of each 10
tor covered with 3M reﬂective mirror ﬁlm, teﬂon, white paint, black sheet, gold sputtering,
aluminum evaporation and white paint+teﬂon. The position, length and thickness depen-
dence of the 3M reﬂective mirror ﬁlm and teﬂon wrapped strip scintillators are measured.
The number of photons being emitted by the scintillator is also determined. As shown in
Figure 2.29 the 3M radiant mirror ﬁlm-wrapped scintillator has the greatest light yield with
an average of 9.2 photoelectrons. It is observed that light yield slightly increases with scin-
tillator’s length, but increases to about 100 % when WLS ﬁber diameter is increased from
1.0 mm to 1.6 mm.

Position dependence of the pulse height of the 10

pulse height along the scintillator strip. This means that there is uniformity of the light
transmission from the sensor to the PMT along the scintillator strip. Figure 2.31 reveals the
position dependence on pulse height across the strip scintillator. A dip is observed across
the strip which is 40 % of the maximum pulse height that corresponds to the scintillator s
thickness (300 µm) just below the 1.6 mm ﬁber. Small peaks are noticeable near the ﬁber

Photon sensors

As the whole calorimeter is designed to be located inside the superconducting solenoid,
photon detectors should be operational in strong magnetic ﬁeld.
In the case of crystal
calorimeter, the light yield is large and popular PIN silicon photo diode or APD can be
used. However, in the case of sampling calorimeter, the light yield is relatively poor and
high-gain high-sensitivity photon detectors are needed. The photon detectors must also be
very compact to be used for the ﬁne-segmented calorimeter.

A new silicon photon detector, Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM), has been developed by
several Russian Groups. SiPM consists of many micro APD pixels being operated in limited
Geiger mode, and the output signal is a sum of the signals from pixels ﬁred by photons.
A schematic view of the structure is shown in Figure 2.32. A similar photon detector is
also being developed with a name of Multi-pixel Photon Counter (MPPC) by Hamamatsu
Photonics. Evaluations of some samples are in progress: SiPMs with 1156 pixels and MPPCs
with 100, 400 and 1600 pixels.

The new silicon photon detectors are potentially ideal for tile/ﬁber readout because of

They have photon counting capability, good at measurement of low intensity light. The
photon counting capability of an MPPC with 1600 pixels is demonstrated in Figure 2.33

The signal output is fast enough for the timing measurement. A time resolution of
30 ps is obtained for 10 photoelectrons with a SiPM.

The thermal noise rate of one photo-electron (one pixel) equivalent signal is rather
high, typically about 1 MHz. This is not a serious problem because the bunch crossing
timing is exactly known at the collider and a narrow gate can be used for charge
integration.

However, SiPM/MPPC is a new and developing photon detector and there are many R&D
items to be performed.

•

According to a result of a test bench measurement where a 2 mm-thick scintillator
strip, a 1 mmφ WLS ﬁber, and a conventional PMT (QE
20 %) were used, the
average number of photoelectrons was 2.5. To have more photon statistics, we will use

1.5 mmφ diameter WLS ﬁbers. Therefore SiPM/MPPC with larger size to ﬁt to the
ﬁber diameter should be developed.

Photon detection eﬃciency (P DE) of SiPM/MPPC is deﬁned by the following formula:

•

P DE = ǫgeom ×

where ǫgeom is the geometrical eﬃciency (a fraction of active pixel area to the total
device area), QE is the wavelength-dependent quantum eﬃciency, and ǫG is the prob-
ability for a carrier created in active pixel area to initiate a Geiger-mode discharge.
The photon detection eﬃciency of the existing SiPM/MPPC is typically 20%. Higher
P DE

50 % is desired to have more photon statistics.

∼

•

Dynamic range of SiPM/MPPC is limited by the total number of pixels in the device,
Ntot. Neglecting cross talk eﬀects, the relation of the output signal (the number of
ﬁred pixels, Npix) and the number of photoelectrons, Npe, is expressed as follows:

Npix = Ntot exp(

Npe/Ntot).

−

For hadronic calorimeter and muon detector, Ntot ∼
1000 may be suﬃcient. For the
EM calorimeter where electromagnetic showers make dense energy deposit in localized
region, much more pixels is needed. According to a Monte Carlo simulation, at least
Ntot ∼
5000 is necessary for the EM calorimeter not to degrade the energy resolution.

We perform such measurements with a YAG laser system in Niigata university, where the
minimum spot size and the position precision of the laser beam are 2 µm and 2 µm, respec-
tively. An improved test bench with a new laser system is being built at KEK dedicated to
the measurements.

Some other properties are still to be tested.

Radiation damage.

We need more samples to do the tests.

We feed back our test results to the companies for further improvements. Good commu-

nication between experimental groups and companies is essential.

Electronics

The calorimeter signals are sent from the photon detectors to the the front-end electronics
through thin cables. As the gain of the new silicon photon sensor is high enough, we do
not need any preampliﬁer. The output signal is so fast that the timing measurement can
be performed with a good accuracy. An important thing is that there are huge (several ten
million) channels, thus low power consumption and small dimension are very desirable.

The readout electronics should digitize an amplitude/current and timing information of
the signal. The timing measurement is necessary to identify the bunch crossing, and the
required resolution of about 10 ns can be obtained without diﬃculty. The about 1 ns time
resolution will be required if we want to distinguish the energy deposits of slow neutrons.
Moreover, with such accurate time resolution one may identify cosmic-ray muons. The time
resolution of the optical system is dominated by that of the wavelength shifting ﬁbers, but
it is still possible to achieve it with the appropriate electronics.

The digitization will be done by either analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a time-
stamping capability or FADC. The dynamic range for the energy measurement is limited
by number of cells in the photon sensor and the electronics. Note that the former has a
saturation eﬀect even below the overﬂow.
In order to discriminate between a MIP and
sensor noises clearly, A MIP signal should produce at least 10 hit cells at the photon sensor.
On the other hand, the pulse height at the shower maximum is expected to be around 200

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

52

times that of the MIP signal. Therefore, the number of cells should be more than 2000, and
the ADC or FADC is required to have 10-bit or more accuracy.

Another important role of the electronics system is to supply power to the silicon photon
detectors. The device has very narrow range of the bias voltage for the operations (< 1
V), thus the power supply should be very stable. In addition, the operational voltage range
diﬀers between pieces; it is more than a few V or 10 V in some cases. A possible solution
would be to group the photon sensors such that the voltage range in a group can be small
enough to be adjusted by, e.g. a digital-to-analog (DAC) converter within 5 V.

The power supply as well as the ADC or FADC will be implemented in an ASIC, which
can have a buﬀer for storing data during a bunch train and a gigabit Ethernet to send data
to the trigger/DAQ system. Some components for the ASIC exists, and the integration for
all features are under development.

2.4.4 Hadron calorimeter

Baseline design

Global structure of the GLD calorimeter detector is shown in Figure 2.34. The GLD hadron
calorimeter consists of absorber (lead plate) and plastic scintillator sandwich. The plastic
scintillator has a shape of strip, which has a straight gloove where a wave length shifting ﬁber
(WLSF) is embedded. This readout scheme gives freedom for the strip length and width,
since the pulse height from the WLSF does not depend on the position where a particle is
passing by. As we are still trying to optimizing the strip length via simulation, we set the
strip length to be 20 cm as the starting point. The width of the strip is set to be 1 cm, similar
to the ECAL case, in order to achieve eﬀective granularity of 1 cm
1 cm with orthogonal
strip layers (Figure 2.35). . The thickness of the scintillator is determined to have enough
light output from minimum ionizing particles by newly developed photon sensors which has

×

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

Figure 2.35: Schematic view of GLD-HCAL super-layer is shown. It consists of three layers
of scintillator and lead.

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

54

a pixel structure. As the base line design, the thickness is set to be 5 mm.

Lead is selected as the absorber material so as to achieve hardware compensation with
scintillator. Since the energy resolution is governed by ﬂuctuation of electromagnetic shower
to the purely hadronic interaction, in order to minimize its ﬂuctuation, electromagnetic
shower output should be suppressed. According to our test beam results, the hardware
compensation is achieved by adopting the ratio of lead : plastic scintillator = 9.1 : 2.

Choice of active material

Plastic scintillator is reliable and stable material for the particle detection. For a long time
the plastic scintillator has been used to detect and measure not only the charged particles
but also neutrons. One of the reasons to choose the plastic scintillator as the active media
of the calorimeter sites on its reliability. Since we need ﬁne granularity as ever constructed
before, we have to be careful for the uniform response of each sub component in numerous
number of pieces. The plastic scintillator is one of the candidates to satisfy this requirement,
since the strip structure has ﬂexibility for its size by using a wave length shifting ﬁber as
scintillation light read out. A problem might be an increase of number of channels of photon
detector for the read out system. Recent development of new type silicon photon sensor is
quite promising for our detector. The progress is already discussed in the ECAL section.
The light signal of scintillator is fast enough to measure the timings, with which we are able
to reject background hits and to recognize neutron hits in the calorimeter.

The active material which contains hydrogen is sensitive to neutrons. It is important to
detect and measure neutrons not only for the compensation but also for the total energy
measurement of hadrons. Those neutrons appear at the tail of the hadron shower process
from decays of excited nuclei.

Generations of their signals usually delays from a particle injection to the calorimeter. In
simulation program used for evaluations of calorimeter performance, the nuclear excitation
and its decays has to be taken into account properly.

Being equipped with the the read out electronics of time measurement capability, we are
able to recognize the neutron signal from other charged hadrons. It is studied by a simulation
base on Geant4.6.2. In the simulation, single-pions is injected into a test HCAL detector
which consists of lead and plastic sandwich calorimeter of 100 layers. The thickness of the
lead plates is 8 mm and that of scintillators is 2 mm, where the size of the detector is 1 m3.
A typical shower eventinduced by a pion is shown in Figure 2.36. The hits are recorded in
1 cm
1 cm cell of plastic scintillator of 2 mm thickness, when the energy deposit exceeds
10% of that of minimum ionization particles (MIPs). In the ﬁgure, satellite hits can be seen
apart from the incident pion trajectory.

×

For the event shown in Figure 2.36, hit timing of each cell are shown as a function of
layer numbers in Figure 2.37. In the ﬁgure, some charged components come from electrons
and positrons produced by gammas in delayed decay of excited nucleus. These hits are also
shown in red round marks in the ﬁgure. The ﬁgure shows a clear separation between neutron
and charged components signals. According to this Geant 4 simulation, we can conclude
that an inclusion or exclusion of neutron contribution in hadronic shower reconstruction are
determined based on a timing information of hit cells.

The scintillator calorimeter can detect the neutrons eﬀectively, while gas calorimeter can
not. The energy measured by the scintillators are plotted as a function of timing cut in

number of hits (green bullet) are plotted as a function of timing cut. At 1000 ns, the energy
shows without any time cut. This shows about 20% of energy is taken by slow neutrons.

Figure 2.38. As seen in the ﬁgure, the energy deposit after 5 nsec amounts to about 20% of
the total energy deposit. It can be attributed to the contribution of slow neutrons. On the
other hand, the energy resolution becomes worse if we cut the slow components of signal at
5 nsec as seen in Figure 2.39. The spread of hadron shower with and without the timing cut
of 5 nsec is shown in Figure 2.40 (a) and (c). For comparison, similar plots in the case of
iron-absorber calorimeter are shown in Figure 2.40 (b) and (d), where the thickness of the
iron absorber and scintillator is 20 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Thicker material thickness
is adopted to simulate with a conﬁguration similar to the calorimeter baseline desing. Since
the nuclear interaction lengths of iron and lead are similar, the ratio of absorber and sensor
thickness are same for the both cases. A thousand of pions are injected and events are
overdrawn in a same ﬁgure. The outer shower cloud is due to the slow neutron component,
whose spreads are determined by the nuclear interaction lengths of the absorbers. Since the
nuclear interaction lengths of lead and iron are similar, the sizes of the outer shower clouds
are similar. On the other hand, the size of the central part of shower in the lead absorber
calorimeter is smaller than that of iron absorber calorimeter, because the radiation length of
lead, which characterizes the size of the central part of shower, is much shorter than that of
iron. This eﬀect is more clearly seen when slow neutron components are cut oﬀ by applying
a timing cut of 5 nsec in Figure 2.40.

This is more clearly shown in Figures 2.41 and 2.42. These ﬁgures show the averaged en-
ergy weighted radius of shower ( ¯RE) in lead and iron absorber calorimeter with (Figure 2.42)

We used the strip shaped scintillator for the calorimeter readout to achieve the eﬀective
readout granularity of 1 cm
1 cm. This is correct as far as a passage of charged particle
in x and y strips is concerned. We are developing an algorithm to resolve the problem when
multi-particles pass through in small area. When the analog information from a strip is
available, we will be able to recognize two particles with their pulse heights.

×

Choice of absorber material

We have two candidates for the absorber materials of the HCAL. One is lead which has
good nature to have compensation in reasonable dimensions, while the other is iron or steel
whose compensation condition is not far from the reality. The compensation means the total
measured energies with an HCAL by electrons and hadrons have same amount. With lead,

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

60

Figure 2.43: Schematic view of hadron calorimeter test module in 1999 at Fermilab

the compensation condition is achieved at 9.1 mm lead vs 2 mm plastic scintillator thickness
according to our test beam results [33]. The compensation condition for iron or steel is not
found by experiments, however, R. Wigmans expects it to be Fe/scintillator to be 15/1 in
the thickness, while his prediction for lead is Pb/scintillaotr to be 4/1. The compensation
can not be achieved by Liquid Ar, since it does not contain hydrogen atoms. The crucial
role of hydrogen in the active material has been demonstrated in L3 experiment at LEP.

Lead has shorter radiation length than that of iron, while the interaction lengths are
similar. As discussed already and shown in Figures 2.40, 2.41, and 2.42, the lateral spread
of shower in a calorimeter using lead absorber is smaller than that using iron absorber. The
smaller lateral spread of shower is preferable for eﬃcient particle ﬂow analysis.

Here we discuss the calorimeter absorber from the detector point of view. In the engi-
neering point of view, the iron absober is preferred because mechanical strength of iron is
much higher than that of lead.

2.4.5 R&D studies

We have already studied the lead scintillator sandwich hadron calorimeter in the test beam.
The results have been published elsewhere [34]. With 20 cm by 20 cm tile, we have con-
structed 1 m3 HCAL, which were segmented in 100 (= 5 x 5x 4) parts. The schematic view
of the detector is shown in Figure 2.43. A tile of 2 mm thick plastic scintillator were used
for the active material and 8 mm thick lead plates were the absorber in this HCAL. Wave
length shifting ﬁber was embedded in a groove of a tile in order to read the scintillation
light. The energy resolution measured up to 200 GeV was plotted for pions and electrons
in Figure 2.44. The e/p ratio which is the measured energy ratio of electrons to pions is

plotted in Figure 2.45.

Figure 2.45 shows the hardware compensation at higher energy region, since the e/p
ratio is very close to be 1.0. At lower energy region, we have measured the e/p ratio [33] by
changing the volume ratio of lead and plastic scintillator. The result is shown in Figure 2.46.

By ﬁtting those data except 1 GeV data, we found that the compensation is achieved at
9.1 mm of lead thickness when the plastic scintillator is 2 mm thick. The expected value of
lead thickness by R. Wigmans is 8 mm for 2 mm scintillator. The tile size was 20 by 20 cm2
for those data. A schematic view of groove for WLFS is shown in green in Figure 2.47. The
thickness of the plastic-scintillator is 2 mm, where we make groove of 1.2 mm to embed the
WLSF of 1 mm.

With the size of 20 cm by 20 cm , we have experienced and tested the HCAL.

2.4.6

calibration system

Unlike the gas chamber in the calorimeter, the stable response of the plastic scintillator is
well known. However, we must have a system to monitor and calibrate the detector response.
There are several ideas to check the response beside the test pulse into the electronics circuit
to test the performance.

1. Calibration with cosmic muons Suppose the size of a strip is 1 cm x 20 cm ,
expected number of cosmic muons passing by is 0.1/cm2/min
20 cm2 = 2/min. This
number is obtained assuming that the detector is located close to the ground. For the
calibration, we need about 100 muons for each strip. This will be achieved only in 50
minutes.

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

64

Figure 2.48: Schematic view of relative calibration of strips by a clear ﬁber.

2. Calibration on Z 0 pole Since the cross section of Z 0 pole is very high, there is an
idea to operate the collider at the Z 0 pole to collect calibration particles, not only for
HCAL but also for other detector components. Assuming an integrated luminosity of 1
1, we have 25 muons / strip. This number is not suﬃcient for calibration, however,
fb−
the high energy 45 GeV muons are much more reliable than cosmic ray muons. We
keep this method as an option for calibration.

3. Halo muons for the endcap HCAL calibration A large number of background
muons are expected to be generated along the ILC beam line. The number of the halo
muons are so large that the muons will be used for the calibration of HCAL in the
endcap region, where the strips are orthogonal to the beam line.

Relative monitoring of scintillation strips is discussed in the next section.

2.4.7 Missing R&Ds

1. Relative calibration scheme We need to have a stable light source to calibrate each
scintillator strip, otherwise we can’t follow the response of all strips. While the beam or
cosmic ray calibration discussed above have limited statistics, the light source system
to illuminate the strip has no such statistical problems. Systematic ﬂuctuation of light
source is rather problematic in this case. Here we have an idea to feed laser or LED
light to many strips simultaneously with clear ﬁbers (Figure 2.48). The problem is
expected at the light connection between the ﬁber and each strip point. Here we have
found a good solution to reduce the number of light source which will be the main
source of the systematic errors.

2. Support structure by engineering study Since we suppose to construct the HCAL
with lead and scintillator sandwich, we have to take into account the mechanical struc-
ture of the lead plates. The pure lead plate is not stiﬀ enough as the structure material,
however, by adding Molybdenum , hardness increases and becomes stiﬀ enough to sup-
port itself. For real structure of HCAL, we have to study this point furthermore.

2.5 Muon detector

2.5.1

Introduction

The main task of the muon detector is to identify muons. The muon momentum is precisely
determined by the inner tracking devices, therefore the muon detector should measure hit
positions with modest accuracy in order to associate them to the ﬁtted track. However,
an independent momentum measurement of the penetrating particle by the muon system
would be preferable, especially for energetic or well-collimated jets, for better matching with
the extrapolated track or even better identiﬁcation of the secondary muons. Modest timing
resolution is also required to tag cosmic-ray muons and to identify the bunch crossing as well
as to reject backgrounds.

A secondary task of the muon detector is to measure the energy leakage of the hadron
showers, i. e. work as the tail catcher. The total energy of particles entering the muon
b¯b at
detector was estimated by a Geant4 simulation for the case of the process e+e−
500 GeV center of mass energy and shown in Figure 2.49. As seen in the ﬁgure, about 10%
of the total evern energy leaks into the muon detector. Since the jet energy resolution is
expected to have 30%/√E with the particle ﬂow technique, the tail catching may become
more important than the previous experiments.

→

event of e+e−

b¯b at 500 GeV center of mass energy.

→

The muon detector will be located outside the hadron calorimeter and the solenoid coil.
The muon identiﬁers are interleaved between the return yoke layers which function as ab-
sorbers in the muon system. The magnetic ﬁeld strength is about 3 Tesla and the total iron
thickness is about 2 m. The structure of the return yoke will be optimized for better ﬁeld
strength in both the bore and the fringe. On the other hand, the shape of the muon system,

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

67

number of active layers, segmentations and detector technology will be chosen by evaluating
the muon identiﬁcation eﬃciency and the energy measurement eﬃciency by the Monte Carlo
simulation and the hardware R & D’s.

Although detector occupancy is supposed to be relatively low in case of e+e− collisions,
we need to verify that the muon detector, especially in the forward region, can cope with
dense jets or particles. Detector coverage and hermeticity of the muon detector should be
excellent for the good detection eﬃciency and the measurements of the missing momentum
with good accuracy.

The association of inner muon tracks with the segments of the muon detectors suﬀers
from energy loss and multiple scattering in the calorimeter and the coil, and the return yoke
itself. The muon momentum is required to be more than 3.5 GeV to go through the coil,
and to be more than 6 GeV to fully penetrate the return yoke in the barrel region , as shown
in Figure 2.50. Hence, in the low momentum region muons have to be identiﬁed by only the
calorimeter, and just below 5 GeV the range measurement in the muon system would help
the energy measurement of the particle.

threshold is found to be 3.5 GeV requiring a hit in the ﬁrst layer, or 6 GeV requiring hits in
all layers.

The spatial resolution of the muon system needed for the track matching should be less
than the spread from the multiple scatterings for muons, given that no other particles pass

shown in Figure 2.51. In the simulation, muons are generated at the interaction point and
emit into the direction of cos θ=0. The hit position is taken from the z-coordinate of the
muon at the ﬁrst active layer.

The relevant muon momentum region is examined by events including jets, for example
b¯b at √s = 500 GeV (Figure 2.52). As seen in the histogram, the average momentum
e+e−
is 20 GeV/c and the majority of the muons are below 50 GeV/c. As the result, we conclude
that the position resolution of about 1 cm is suﬃcient for the good association of charged
tracks from the inner trackers.

2.5.2 Baseline design

In the GLD detector, the muon detector covers a very large region and is sandwiched between
the return yoke. This implies that the technology should be inexpensive and reliable because
it will be diﬃcult to access and replace, and we have to operate it
for more than a decade. Also, the detector must be tolerant of

the radiation and the aging. Therefore a well-established technology must be chosen, and

we adopt an scintillator-ﬁber technique as the

baseline design. Since this technology is also chosen for the
calorimeter, we will be able to save the cost for production
as well as R&D’s. Photon sensor will be a Geiger-mode photon
counter, which is being developed actively, can also be shared
with the calorimeter, and the read-out electronics is similar to
that of the calorimeter. Sensitivity to neutrons is also an issue for the scintillator, as

discussed in the calorimeter section, and the timing information may be helpful again.

The cross-sectional view of the
muon detector is shown in Figure 1.2.

×

It has an dodecagonal shape in the r-φ view.
There are nine active layers in both barrel and endcap regions, and each active layer has
two orthogonal layers of the scintillator-bar arrays. The scintillator bar has a cross section
of 5
5 cm and the length varies according to the location. A wavelength shifting (WLS)
ﬁber is embedded into the straight groove along the scintillator, and at the both ends of
the groove the silicon photon sensors are directly attached to the ﬁber. The scintillator and
the WLS ﬁber might be too long to propagate photons to the sensors, and we may need to
break the scintillator into pieces to decrease the light attenuation. In this case we still keep
the detection eﬃciency high to minimize the dead space. With the readout at both ends, we

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

70

can obtain the rough hit position along the scintillator by the time diﬀerence of the signals.
Detector calibration will be performed by using cosmic muons for the barrel region and
halo muons for endcap regions. Because the scintillator size is large, we can calibrate the
system within a few % level. Additional calibration system (LED etc.) may be used for the
backup.

2.5.3 R&D studies

Since the scintillator-ﬁber scheme is well-established, we concentrate on photon sensor for
hardware R&D’s, and it is already described in the calorimeter section. The electronics for
the muon detector is also almost the same as that for the calorimeter.

Simulation studies have been performed to investigate the following items: (1) hit density
at the front of the muon detector, (2) hit point smearing due to the material in front of the
muon detector and the return yoke.

2.5.4 Missing R&Ds

In order to ﬁnalize the detector design, some parameters are still to be optimized. They are
number of layers, scintillator thickness and width. More simulation studies for the muon
detection eﬃciency and the tail catching capability are needed for tuning those parameters.
For the hardware study, as the scintillator bar and the WLS ﬁber become very long, care
should be taken for the optical quality of the detector so that the photon sensors can receive
enough photons. Thus, the optical characteristics of the scintillator and the WLS ﬁber,
scintillator length and photon-detection eﬃciency of the photon sensors should be tested
and justiﬁed for real use.

Although the scintillator-ﬁber system is expected to perform well, another technology is

considered as an option, which is resistive

plate chambers (RPCs). Large area RPC systems have been used by experiments at
B-Factories. RPC has simple structure and can be built with inexpensive cost. However,
RPC needs a mixture of gases which should be avoided if possible for stable operations.

2.6 Small Angle Detectors

2.6.1

Introduction

→

At linear colliders it is expected that a large number of e+e− pairs are created by the QED
e+e− where γ may be oﬀ-shell or near-on-shell [36]. If the charge of the created
process γγ
and the on-coming bunch have the same sign, it is known [37] that distributions of pT and
azimuthal angle of the created particles can be used to study σx and σy of the on-coming
bunch. It should be noted that this technique allows to measure independently the size of
the two beams because the created particles are deﬂected asymmetrically in the forward and
backward angular regions if the two beams have diﬀerent parameters. The goal of the pair
monitor is to detect the e+e− pairs in order to extract the beam proﬁle parameters.

Also, at linear colliders it is expected that a precise measurement of the luminosity can be
achieved by detecting electrons from Bhabha scattering. Calorimeters capable of detecting
electrons at the very forward regions are typically used for such luminosity measurement.
Another important role of such calorimeters is to veto forward leptons. It becomes important
as it is closely related with the detection of sleptons [38], in the scenario where the lightest
SUSY partile (LSP) is the lightest neutralino ˜χ0
1.This particle is considered as the best
candidate to satisfy the cosmological constraints on the dark matter in the universe. The
WMAP [39] results imply a very small diﬀerence between the lightest slepton mass, the
SUSY partner of the τ which will be called ˜τ1, and the LSP mass. Since this feature is
quite general, it is important to have an experimental access on the detection of sleptons at
the future linear collider. Experimentally, one needs to measure ˜τ1 decaying into a τ lepton
with one or two neutrinos in the ﬁnal state which even further reduced the amount of visible
energy. Near threshold, the cross section is at the 10 f b level with a potentially very large
background due to the four fermion ﬁnal states, the so-called γ
γ background, which is at
the nb level. In usual cases the standard backgrounds can be eliminated by vetoing forward
electrons. Therefore, another important role of calorimeter detectors at small angles is to
veto background events by identifying electrons in the forward region.

−

In this document, we call small angle detectors as a set of the following detectors: forward
calorimeter (FCAL), the beamline calorimeter (BCAL), and the pair monitor (PM). Silicon-
Tungsten sampling calorimeter is the default technology for both FCAL and BCAL. As an
option, diamond/W detector is considered since the diamond is the radiation hard sensor.
FCAL can also serves as a beam mask. PM serves as a beam proﬁle monitor. A 3-dimensional
silicon pixel technology is chosen for the PM. In following sections, we discuss technology
choice, conﬁguration, and performance of each detectors.

2.6.2 Forward and Beamline Calorimeters

The FCAL is located behind the endcap of the TPC in z direction.
It is a cylindrical
structure with its axis coinciding with the z axis ( see Figure 1.3). It has 45 layers of Silicon-
air gap-Tungsten sandwich. Thebaseline thickness of the detector is described in Table 2.9.
The geometry of the FCAL is described in Figure 2.53. One sandwich is 5.5 mm thick and
in total thickness of the FCAL becomes 250 mm. The FCAL covers from 260 cm to 285 cm
in z coordinates and from 12 cm to 36 cm in the radial coordinates. The segmentation in φ
direction is eight.

Figure 2.55: FCAL total deposited energy

In order to check the performance of FCAL, we used GEANT4 program to simulate
FCAL. Figure 2.54 shows the energy deposited as a function of the layer for 100 GeV
electrons hitting the detector. The shower maximum occurs at the layer 11 and small
fraction of the energy is lost. Figure 2.55 shows the variations of the total energy deposited
in the FCAL. Approximately the energy resolution(∆E/E) of 23%/√E is achieved for the
100 GeV electrons.

The BCAL is located further downstream from the IP. It covers from z = 430 cm to z =
450 cm. It has a sampling structure similar to FCAL, except the fact that the air gap is 0.7
mm.

2.6.3 Pair Monitor

The current technology for PM adapts the 3-dimentional active pixel sensor, forming a
double layer of silicon disks. It is located in front of the BCAL. The z position of the PMis
400 cm and 401 cm from the IP. The inner radius of the disk is 2 cm and the outer radius
reaches to 8.5 cm. It consists of an array of trapezoidal wedges, each composed by a sensor
and a readout chip. There will be a large mount of X-ray hits from nearby devices such as
quadrupoles, luminosity monitors that need to be removed either by requiring a coincidence
between two adjacent wheels or by being able to set a clean 70 keV threshold per hit [40],
thus reducing by 50 % the overall number of needed channels. Most of the created pairs will
hit the central part of the monitor while X-rays are almost uniformlydistributed generating
a background that needs to be removed in the external region where the monitor should
withstand an occupancy up to 30% of created pairs per train crossing.

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

74

Beam instabilities are often caused by preceding bunches in a train: it is thus desirable
to measure the beam proﬁle for individualbunch or at least as a function of time from the
beginning of train. It is also highly desirable that such information be available real time
for machine tuning. The high occupancy suggests that silicon strip detectors are not suited
for this application. A CCD sensor would be a good candidate in terms of occupancy; since
the integrated charge deposit in each pixel is read out at the end of each train, however, the
information on the location in a train is lost unless some external gating is applied. On the
other hand, active pixel sensors can handle high occupancies just as CCDs and timing of hit
can be digitized on each pixel. The 3D pixel design is particularly suited for this application
for the following reasons:

•

•

•

it is fast: the charge collection time is about 10 times faster than typical pixel devices,
for a 50 µm pitch 3D cell where the ionizing track is midway between the central p
and corner n electrode, perpendicular to the surface of the silicon crystal.

it is radiation hard: the depletion voltage is of the order of 5 V and has a large margin
for increase by radiation.

2.7 Detector Magnet and Structure

2.7.1 Detector Magnet

Introduction

A superconducting solenoid magnet has been studied for the GLD detector. The required
central magnetic ﬁeld is 3 T in a cylindrical volume of 8 m in diameter and 9.5 m in total
length. The stored energy is calculated to be 1.6 GJ. A 0.5 m length of correction coils is
attached at both end of the solenoid coil to satisfy requirement of ﬁeld uniformity. Because
the magnet is planed to locate outside of the calorimeter, it is not necessary to design as a
thin superconducting solenoid magnet. Therefore, the weight of the calorimeter estimated
2000 tons is planed to support at the inner wall of cryostat.

General Design

The magnet provides a central magnetic ﬁeld of 3 T at nominal current of 7956 A in a
cylindrical volume of 8 m in diameter and 9.5 m in length. The current density is about 60
percent of the critical current density. It is placed outside the calorimeter to achieve good
hermeticity. The coil consists of double layers of aluminum stabilized superconductor wound
around the inner surface of an aluminum support cylinder made of JIS-A5083(Figure 2.56).
According to the detector requirements, the integrated ﬁeld uniformity has to be less than
2mm. Thus 0.5 m length of four-layer coil is adopted at both of the coil. Indirect cooling will
be provided by liquid helium circulating through a single tube welded on the outer surface
of the support cylinder. Main parameters of the GLD solenoid magnet are summarized in
Table 2.10. Radiation shields consist of 20 K shield and 80 K shield are placed between the
coil and the vacuum vessel. These shields have to be decoupled electrically from both the
coil and the vessel walls in order to avoid the eﬀect of eddy current induced by the inner
and the outer coaxial cylinders that are connected by ﬂat annular bulkheads at each end.

Coil Design

Superconducting wire for the GLD solenoid is based on the ATLAS superconducting wire.
The size is scaled-up to 6.5mm width and 45mm height in order to absorb a magnetic force
in the coil. The mechanical structure of the superconduction coil must sustain two main
mechanical stresses, hoop stress and axial stress in the coil. The calculation results are
shown in Figure 2.57 and the deformation of the coil when the solenoid excitation is shown
in Figure 2.58. Even though the yield strength of superconducting wire is achieved to around
250 MPa at recent high strength superconducting wire development, it is assumed to yield
strength of 150 MPa in this design. The combined stress, Von Mises, in the coil when the
central magnetic ﬁeld of 3 T is calculated to be 130 MPa. According to the calculation
result, required thickness to keep within yield strength in the coil is to be 30 mm for support
cylinder and 2 layers of 45 mm-thick for coil, respectively. From these required thickness,
the cold mass is approximately 78 tons. The stored energy is calculated to be 1.6 GJ. The
solenoid magnet will be supported at the innermost layers of barrel iron yoke by ﬁxing the
support structure on the outer vacuum vessel. The coil support system has to transmit both
the weight of cold mass and the magnetic de-centering forces. If the geometrical center of
the solenoid and the iron yoke are deviated, an unbalanced magnetic force is generated. So
this force has to be taken into account on the coil support design. And another important
requirement is that the coil supports have to follow the thermal shrinkage in the cooling
down. The conﬁguration of the coil supports is planed to adopt a rod type made of GFRP.
In the de-centering calculation, a 380 tons in the axial direction and 130 tons in radial
directions of de-centering forces act on the coil supports if the magnet and iron yoke is
deviated 25 mm.

Cryostat Design

Since the magnet is located outside of the calorimeter, it is not necessary to design as a
thin superconducting solenoid magnet. Therefore, the weight of the calorimeter which is
estimated to be 2000 tons is planed to support at the inner wall of cryostat. Load conditions
for cryostat design are 2000 tons of self-weight of the calorimeter, 78 tons of cold mass,
380 tons of de-centering force on the bulk head and 0.1MPa of vacuum pressure. The
cryostat material is assumed to be stainless steel. Thickness of the outer vacuum vessel can

be calculated from the design guide line named NASA-SP8007. Then thickness of outer
vacuum wall was calculated to be 60 mm with a safety margin of two. Figure 2.59 shows the
calculation result when the weight of the calorimeter is suspended at horizontal positions of
the inner wall. In this calculation, 60 mm of outer vacuum vessel, 100 mm of end plate and
60 mm of inner vessel were deﬁned. The maximum stress is calculated to be about 118 MPa,
this is below the allowable stress of stainless steel. The deformation is about 9 mm. In the
seismic force calculation, load condition is 0.3 G of the self-weight of calorimeter is input to
the horizontal direction of the inner vacuum wall. This result is 125 MPa of maximum stress
and 9mm of deformation. One important thing in these calculations is that the calorimeter
has a stiﬀ structure. Otherwise, the self-weight of the calorimeter is placed on the bottom
of the inner wall of the cryostat, which will cause the high stress level in the cryostat.

Assembly Procedure

Drawing of the solenoid magnet is shown in Figure 2.60. Assembly procedure of the solenoid
magnet will be similar to the ATLAS solenoid magnet. In that procedure, the superconductor
is wound to the temporal mandrel with a cover by insulator at ﬁrst. Then the coil winding
is carried out after the temporal mandrel is set to the winding machine located inside the
support cylinder. After this process, pure-al strips are mounted on the inner surface of the
coil. The solenoid coil is completed after curing. Outer radiation shield is installed to the
inside of the outer vacuum vessel. Then the coil with axial supports is installed. The inner
radiation shield and inner vacuum vessel will be assembled. Then bulk heads are ﬁxed. After
the coil position is adjusted and the solenoid is laid down, the chimney is mounted. This
work might be done after installation of the solenoid to the return yoke.

Conclusion

The GLD superconducting solenoid magnet has been studied. The coil design and supercon-
ducting wire design has mainly reported in this section. The thermal design and cryogenic
design should be more investigated. In the mechanical design, support conﬁguration of the
solenoid magnet and the installation procedure should be carried out as the next step.

2.7.2 Structure

Introduction

An iron structure for the GLD detector has been studied and designed. The structure
consists of the barrel and two end-yoke sections with dodecagonal shape. The overall height
is about 17 m from the ﬂoor level; the depth is about 16 m. The iron structure will be made
from low-carbon steel (JIS-S10C). The total weight except for sub-detectors is approximately
16000 tons, and it will be placed on the transportation system for roll-in/out. Assembling of
the iron yoke and installation of the sub-detector will be carried out at the roll-out position
and then moved to the roll-in position for the experiment. The end-yoke separates at its
center and then opens to access the sub-detectors. Some kind of design studies are required
to optimize the iron yoke conﬁguration. Those are the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld,
stability against the acted force such as self-weight of iron yoke and assembling/maintenance
consideration. In the magnetic ﬁeld study, the iron yoke is acted on the magnetic ﬁeld of
3 T from the GLD solenoid magnet, amount of iron have to be determined for improving
the ﬁeld uniformity in the TPC volume, and leakage ﬁeld outside of the iron yoke is kept
minimize by absorbing the ﬂux return. In the mechanical design, it is required to study on
the deformation and stress level against heavy self-weight of iron and strong magnetic force.
As the other important issue for the mechanical design, an earthquake resistant design is
required.

Magnetic Field Design

There are two criteria for the magnetic design. One is integrated ﬁeld uniformity in the
TPC volume is less than 2mm. And another is leakage ﬁeld at 10 m away from the solenoid
center should be less than 50 gauss from the requirement of accelerator design. Between the

barrel-yoke and the end-yoke, a 50 mm of air-gap is provided for passing though the cables
from the inner detectors. With keeping these requirements, thickness of iron plates were
tried to minimize as much as possible. Permeability of iron plate used for the calculation
is the measurement data of the BELLE iron yoke as shown in Figure 2.61. The ways to
improve the ﬁeld uniformity without increasing the amount of iron are are to change the
parameters of correction coil, which is located at the both ends, such as current density and
coil length. Other ways are to change the radius and thickness of iron inside the solenoid. The
distribution of magnetic ﬁeld density is show in right-hand side of Figure 2.62. The calculated
ﬁeld uniformity is from -0.5 mm to +0.05 mm as shown in left-hand side of Figure 2.62. The
magnetic ﬁeld along the beam line is shown in Figure 2.63. The leakage ﬁeld at 10 m away
In this calculation, the outer two
from the solenoid center is calculated to be 44 gauss.
layers of return yoke has to be 50 cm-thick of iron plate to reduce the leakage ﬁeld. From
this calculation, each iron plate thickness of barrel and end-yoke can be optimized.

Mechanical Design

The mechanical strength of JIS-S10C are 310 MPa of tensile strength and 205 MPa of
yield strength, respectively. The iron yoke has to withstand against three kinds of load
conditions. Those are self-weight, magnetic force and seismic force. The self-weight of iron
yoke is estimated to 16000 tons. The barrel yoke is about 7500 tons and end-yoke is 8500
tons, respectively. The magnetic force is calculated to be 18000 tons. An input acceleration
for the seismic design is applied 0.3G. The gravitational sag of barrel yoke is calculated to
be 1.8 mm maximum. The stress level in the calculation was small enough. It is important
to assemble with keeping the rigid structure. The gravitational sag of end-yoke is neglected.
The deformation of the end-yoke due to the magnetic force of 18000 tons is shown in left-
hand side of Figure 2.64. The maximum deformation was calculated to be 75 mm. Becausue
this deformation can not be accepted, a support plate is required to reduce deformation and
stress. The calculation result with 75 mm-thick of support plates are shown in the right-hand
side of Figure 2.64. The support plate is mounted on every 90 degree. The deformation can
be reduced to 1.8 mm. The result of seismic force is 2.8 mm in the horizontal direction.

Conﬁgurations

Drawing of the iron yoke is shown in Figure 2.65. The prefered shape of the yoke is a
dodecagon from the viewpoint of the calorimeter design. There is a 50 mm air-gap between
the barrel-yoke and the end-yoke as cable holes. So the barrel-yoke structure is constructed
from twelve Muon modules. Each barrel Muon module consists of 9 layers with 50 mm thick
instrumental gaps. Thicknesses of steel plates are 50 cm in outer two layers and 25cm in other
layers, respectively. Few millimeters of ﬂatness of steel plate should be taken into account
on the Muon detector design. Each end-yoke is planned to separate into four quadrants
containing eleven iron plates. Plate thickness of each layer is same as the corresponding
plate of the barrel yoke. The end-yoke can slide out in order to provide an access to the
inner detector. The iron yoke is sitting on an end-yoke transportation system.

Assembling

Assembling procedure for the barrel-yoke is shown in Figure 2.66. Each Iron plates are bolted
on the support frame. There are support jigs at each corner. Assembling will be done from
the bottom side and the outer layer. At end-yoke assembling, each pieces divided to eight
are assembled by welding. Because the end-yoke must withstand the huge magnetic force,
each piece should be ﬁxed rigidly. After completing each segment, end-yoke is assembled by
bolting joints as shown in Figure 2.67.

Experimental Hall

One of the request from the facility study team is that the smaller experimental hall is
preferred from the viewpoint of the cost. To meat this request, a mechanism to open the

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

end yoke is important. The way to open the end yokes at the experimental hall is to rotate
the end-yoke by 90 degree like a door at ﬁrst, then slide it along the beam direction about
10 m. Then, an access to the inner detector is possible. There are several kinds of moving
devices available in the market, such as linear-guide system, air-pad system and so on. It
is preferred to use an spherical roller table. Because the movement of the end-yoke is not
only in one direction, i.e., including rotation and sliding. The spherical roller table can be
used to move multi directions and air supply system is unnecessary. Figure 2.68 shows the
experimental hall. The size of the hall is 72 m length, 32 m width and 40 m high. Two area,
experimental area and maintenance area, are planed. The distance from the beam line and
the nearest wall is 9 m.

Conclusion

In this magnetic ﬁeld design, ﬁeld uniformity and leakage ﬁeld can be satisﬁed. Those
are 0.2 mm and 40 gauss, respectively, and they are well below the criteria. To support the
magnetic force on the end-yoke, 75 mm-thick of support plate is necessary even though eﬀects
of self-weight and seismic force are small. Parameters of the GLD iron yoke is summarized
in Table 2.11. Based on the basic plan of the assembling procedure and the experimental
hall presented here, more detail design is necessary.

2.8 Data Acquisition

2.8.1

Introduction

In a ﬁrst look, the data acquisition (DAQ) system for a ILC detector might be just a
signiﬁcant extrapolation, using more modern technologies than those used in all prior large
scale, high energy physics collider experiments.

It should, a priori, be less demanding than the hadron colliders (Tevatron and LHC). ILC
detector doesn’t have to cope with multiple minimum bias events per bunch crossing (BX)
and high rate triggering for needles in a haystack, and radiation hardness is less critical.
Hence many more detector technologies are available and better performance is possible.
But, contrary to discovery machines, ILC detector does have to record all the observable
information; measure jets and charged tracks with unparalleled precision, measure beam
energy and its spread, diﬀerential luminosity and polarization, and tag all vertices, thus
better performance and full hermiticity are needed in order to do physics with all ﬁnal
states.

Compared to previous lepton colliders (LEP, SLC and B-Factories) where jets and leptons
are the fundamental quanta, they must be identiﬁed and measured well enough to discrimi-
nate between Z’s, W ’s, H’s and possible new states. Challenging ILC physics goals requires
to improve the jet resolution by a factor of two, and the excellent tracking capability for
recoil mass measurements in the Higgs boson search, which requires 10 times better momen-
tum resolution than LEP/SLD detectors and 1/3 better on the impact parameter resolution
t¯tH can decay into 8 jets), the need of a
than SLD. To catch multi-jet ﬁnal states (e.g.
real 4π solid angle coverage with full detector capability is fundamental. Furthermore, the
paradigm of “Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA)” for precision measurement of the jet energy
requires an unprecedented ﬁne-granularity calorimeter for good separation of charged and
neutral particles. Such hermiticity and granularity have never been done up to now. Finally,
the PFA also puts new challenge for real time analysis.

In summary, at the ILC the stringent requirements imposed by the high precision physics
goals need a detector concept structure with full hermiticity, high granularity detectors
with a DAQ able to select, analyze and store standard as well as rare events in a huge
background environment. In addition, the high luminosity operation at the interaction point
of the linear accelerator with two long independent arms needs to be optimized in real time
using simultaneous information of both machine and experiment. These features put new
requirements and challenges in this domain to be addressed.

From the conceptual point of view, the burst mode of the beam structure of the ILC
machine (3000 BXs for a duration of roughly 1 ms at 5 Hz frequency) yields a BX rate of 3
MHz for 1 ms followed by a period of almost 200 ms without any interaction. That dictates
immediately an innovative DAQ architecture with no hardware trigger.

From the technical point of view, the rapid development of computing and telecom tech-
nologies as well as the higher integration and lower power consumption of electronic com-
ponents ﬁts nicely with the requirements needed for all modern DAQ components. For such
large and long-term life system, the uniformity of the various interfaces associated with
standardized components is vital to achieve ﬂexibility, maintainability, scalability at an af-
fordable eﬀort, requiring commodity hardware and industry standards to be used wherever
possible.

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

89

Therefore, and partly because of the rather much dependence of the detector design, the
DAQ system presented at this stage is only a conceptual model with some basic principles
to be reﬁned later, for example, the implementation of special non machine synchronized
triggers such as Calibration, Cosmic. However, its aims is to deﬁne clearly the common and
uniform interfaces between the various logical components and to show the feasibility of the
system in general.

2.8.2 Event Selection System (Trigger)

The main goal of event selection system (Trigger) is to select interesting events in the pres-
ence of several orders of magnitude higher background without losing data of a possible, yet
unknown, physics process. In addition the rates of the known interesting physics processes
vary as well by several orders of magnitude. The ILC operation conditions are quite dif-
ferent from those of accelerators currently operating or being constructed. The main ILC
parameters of the 500 GeV present design, relevant for the DAQ system, are:

a long time interval between two bunch trains of 200 ms,

a separation of two bunches inside a train by 308 ns,

a train length of 868 µs.

•

•

•

These conditions drive the proposal of an event building without any hardware trigger,
followed by a fully software based event selection, identiﬁcation and analysis. This concept
allows to analyze each event one by one without taking into account a ﬁxed trigger latency
as it is done in the standard experiments.

To achieve a dead-time free data acquisition under the ILC operation conditions, a trigger-
free pipeline of 1 ms with readout of all data in the pipeline within 200 ms is proposed. The
full data paths and data ﬂow is presented in the Figure 2.69.

In the ﬁrst step, during the 1 ms bunch train of 3000 collisions, each detector channel
signal is digitally processed at its front end without any trigger interrupt. During or im-
mediately after this, 1 ms active pipeline, depending on the detector type, the raw data
throughput will be reduced directly at the subdetector front end level by implementing
the usual data compression tools and algorithms like zero suppression, sparciﬁcation, hit
detection or cluster ﬁnding before storing the relevant data fragment in a local buﬀer.

In a second step, during the ﬁrst part of 200 ms available with no beam, a collection of
all the data in the full bunch train is performed. Each locally stored front end data fragment
is digitally multiplexed in a reasonable quantity of fast read out links and then pushed to
a series of Bunch Train read out Buﬀer (BTB) mapping each detector. After the necessary
time of data collection estimated few ms, which is compatible with the power cycling of the
font-end electronics, the complete collection of the full bunch train data is performed by one
processing element, the Bunch Train Processor (BTP) of the online farm, prior to a software
selection of Bunches Of Interest (BOI) using a speciﬁc set of raw data followed by an event
classiﬁcation according to physics, calibration and machine needs. The only constraint in
this model is that the data collection task should be made within the
190 ms, remaining
several ms before the next bunch train, in order to free all the read out buﬀers (BTB’s),
however the rest of the treatment could be longer since the following bunch train will be

analyzed in another processor. This scheme of merging all the processing tasks from the
event builder and event ﬁnder in one processor unit, avoids to move data several times and
makes event management and control easier.

The evolution of embedded processing power and network will allow to merge in this
processor all the successive software tasks, accomplished today in large experiments like the
so-called Level 2 (L2), Level 3 (L3), High Level Trigger and Filter (HLT), up to the ﬁrst
full reconstruction and physics analysis using the PFA of each BOI event. In addition the
standard real time monitoring tasks should be performed like calibration and alignment for
the detectors as well as complete analysis of sampled events. From the total hadronic cross
section for e+e−-annihilation, about 0.1 for high Q2 events per train are expected and 4 for
Bhabha whereas about 200 events per train will come from γγ reactions. All these events
are potentially interesting, e.g. γγ and low ∆M SUSY are very diﬃcult to distinguish, and a
systematic storage of those candidates might be necessary prior to a complex analysis carried
out later on. Assuming a rate of 200 BOI selected per bunch train and processing time of
1 second per event in average to perform all these analysis tasks, a farm of 1024 processors
would be necessary.

2.8.3 DAQ Boundaries and Read Out Architecture

One of the most important tasks in the development of a DAQ system for the GLD detector
is the choice of a coherent architecture that meets the requirements of all subdetectors. The
system cost will be minimized and the reliability and ease of debugging optimized if an ar-
chitecture is chosen that is uniformly applied. The requirements for the GLD DAQ system
fall into four broad categories. First are the quantitative requirements such as those on the
bandwidths of data paths and the number of data sources and data volume to be accom-
modated. Second are the important architectural requirements that allow front end systems
and event selection to be operated together or independently. Third are the requirements
for initializing, controlling and monitoring the system. Last are the qualitative requirements
for items such as reliability, tolerable error rates and maintainability. All these requirements
can be grouped in four functional blocks and their interfaces.

Detector Front End Electronics (DFE)

The term of front end electronics is broadly used to denote the electronics that is physi-
cally located within the GLD detector. Its basic purpose is to convert sets of signals from
each detector element into digital event fragment. The signal processing typically contains
low-noise, high time resolution ampliﬁers and signal shapers. Each ampliﬁer receives a sig-
nal, almost always an analog signal, from one sensor element such as pixel, Si strip, TPC,
SiPM/MPPC. The signal is shaped in order to extract the best quality time and/or am-
plitude information from the input signal. Digitization or quantization occurs immediately
after this stage. The provision for generating calibration signals is typically made. This
feature can be used for channel time and/or amplitude calibration by inserting artiﬁcial sets
of data to test all or part of the electronics chain. The signal must be preserved within the
front end system for the 1 ms bunch train. The front end electronics system of the GLD
detector will be implemented in various ways, depending on the sensor type.

The impact of a 1 ms active pipeline without trigger interrupt and therefore no possibility

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

92

of a fast clear or buﬀer ﬂushing for the diﬀerent subdetector pipelines has been studied
and readout technologies able to cope with this have been proposed for several detector
technologies. For the vertex detector built in CCD technology, a column parallel readout
at a speed of 50 MHz during the active pipeline has been proposed to handle the expected
data rates. For the TPC several designs are being studied which allow the collection of
signals in an ungated mode for the full time of the pipeline by limiting the ion feedback with
Micro Pattern Detector read out (GEM, Micromegas), and for the scintillator devices (EM
and hadron calorimeters and muon detector), built out of silicon avalanche photodiode, a
continuously running pipeline with hit detection and multiplexing is foreseen. The uniform
interface between the DFE and DAQ system is the Local Detector Buﬀer (LDB).

Machine Detector Interface (MDI)

The adjustment of the luminosity should be carried out at the beginning of each bunch
train. The current thinking is to use the very forward calorimeter (BCAL) raw data of
about 10 to 50 bunches to get an immediate feedback for the machine. Accordingly, the
forward calorimeters have to be read out at each bunch crossing and the readout philosophy
is diﬀerent from the rest of the detector elements. Other complex information can be sent
during the full bunch train analysis of speciﬁc background events. Another feature connected
to the machine are the bunch synchronization and distribution.

Data Acquisition (DAQ)

This is the central part of the system. It is divided functionally into three main architectural
components, the read out node, the network switch and the bunch train processor (BTP)
farm.

The read out node associated with one detector collects all the data fragments in one
bunch train into a Bunch Train Buﬀer (BTB). This is done by regrouping and multiplexing
the various front end local buﬀer scattered inside and around the GLD physical structure
in a minimum number of fast data links. Building the bunch train sub events as well as
checking the integrity of its content requires some intelligence and fast connectivity at that
level that controls all relevant tasks associated with one detector. This is a networking hub
where a uniform interface across all the various detectors between the front end electronics
and the DAQ should be installed. Today, it will be done using PCI mezzanines with powerful
FPGA’s embedded on VME or PC boards.

The network switch with a typical capacity of 10-20 Gbit/sec will be adequate to collect
and distribute the full bunch train data, estimated today at 140 MBytes, to the designated
Bunch Train Processor.

The event building will be performed at 1-2 GByte/sec and the Bunch Of Interest se-
lection can select up to 250 events including the γγ physics processes as well as additional
calibration and background events for cross checks. The event size varies from 0.2 MBytes
to 5 MBytes, depending on the amount of background included. Assuming background data
to be suppressed, the processed event size will be on average about 1 MByte which leads
to 250 MByte/sec output to be transfer to the mass storage. This results in a total data
volume of roughly 1 GByte/sec or 10 PByte/year, e.g. 10 times the LHC production. This
seems a little bit too much and more study is needed to reduce this data volume in an

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

93

unbiased way. Considering that 90% of the data are produced by TPC, calorimeters and
VTX and that most data volume is background, some reduction would be possible to clean
up event by removing noise hits, using the time stamp on one bunch crossing and recording
only interesting regions or tracks. A rough qualitative analysis of this issue would expect a
reduction of a factor of 5 to 10.

Compared to systems built for the LHC experiments, the proposed DAQ system for GLD
is less demanding and key components like the fast switching network and the computing
units are available already today.

Global Detector Network (GDN)

The international worldwide structure of the ILC/GLD collaboration combined with the
fantastic development of fast communication tools allows us today to imagine a new way
in High Energy Physics to gain control of the experiment from the detector calibration and
monitoring to the physics analysis.

With the exceptions of the detector integration and commissioning, the rest of the de-
tector operation, in particular data taking and its associated services (ancillary controls,
partitioning, databases management, . . . ), can be distributed among several virtual control
rooms. It would be possible to select from these remote stations the running modes between
stand alone, cosmic test, calibration and global runs without coming to the detector site in
person, as is done for many embedded satellite experiments.

From the physics analysis point of view, the boundaries between so-called online and
oﬄine will disappear and the development of GRID technologies shows that it will be possible
in the future to analyze data without knowing where the processing is made.

Technologies Forecast

The fast development in the computing and network area makes it diﬃcult to predict the
technologies which will ﬁnally be used to build the DAQ system in several years from now.
A short overview of possible evolution of technologies is presented below, based on past
experiences, current running experiments and studies for the experiments planned at the
LHC.

Concerning the Standards: this is the end of traditional parallel backplane bus paradigm
(CAMAC, Fastbus, VME). It has been announced every year since
1989, but still there
at LHC with VME and PCI. Recently, a new commercial standard has been emerging from
the telecom industry named Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture (ATCA) designed
for a very high system throughput (2 Tbit/sec) and availability (99.999%, failure rate of
5
∼
min/year). It has the technical features well suited for all our needs particularly to host the
detector bunch train read out hub as well as the basic components of the machine control.
The basic software is already available under Linux.

∼

The commercial networking products for Trigger/DAQ switches was already available in
the 90’s: ATM, DS-Link, Fibre Channel, SCI, etc. Today, the Gigabit Ethernet is the most
popular with the rapid bandwidth evolution from 1 Gbit/sec to 10 Gbit/sec and with the
objective to reach 30 Gbit/sec in 2010.

The ideal fast processing / memory / IO bandwidth devices existed in the past: Trans-
puters, DSP’s, and RISC processors. Today, there are powerful FPGA’s that integrate

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

everything: the LVDS receiver links, DSP’s, large memory, as well as more general purpose
processors like PowerPC.

For the point-to-point link technology, the old style used even recently at LHC was
parallel copper or serial optical. The recent evolution is to go toward the serial copper and
parallel optics. The link speed is > 3 Gbit/sec today and 10 Gbit/sec is in demonstration.
The continuous increasing of the computing power for the processor power and clock
(today 4GHz, 10 to 15 GHz foreseen in 2010) is not anymore a critical issue. Idem for the
memory size which is now quasi unlimited (blocks of 256 MB today, few GB in 2010).

In conclusion, the evolution of technologies described above shows that there will be

adequate components when the ﬁnal decision has to be made.

2.8.4 Strategy for the Future

Previous experiences of DAQ systems demonstrate that the ﬁnal technologies and their
associated commercial components should be chosen as late as possible, e.g. 3–4 years
before the ﬁrst beam collision. However, the architectural model with its functional blocks
and interfaces should be adopted as early as possible in order that the various detectors
could develop the necessarily uniform interfaces at the front end electronic level. Hence, the
basic idea is to organize the DAQ development around a common pilot project across the
various concepts and detector R&D. This pilot project should address all the main issues and
also details attached to the conceptual model described above, such as the integration and
feedback of the machine and its synchronization, slow controls, non machine synchronized
acquisition modes like calibration, test and cosmic trigger. It is also the place where state
of the art technologies like ATCA could be practiced and evaluated. Finally, the worldwide
aspect of such pilot project will be a learning process for developing and optimizing all the
Global Detector Network functionalities.

2.9 Machine Detector Interface

2.9.1 Background Tolerances in GLD

Background tolerances of the vertex detector (VTX), the TPC, and the calorimeter (CAL)
are estimated in terms of tracking capabilities and radiation hardness. The tolerances de-
pends on readout time or sensitive time of detectors, which are O(1) msec, 50 µsec and
100 nsec for FPCCD VTX, TPC and CAL, respectively.

To achiveve a good eﬃciency in track reconstruction, the occupancy in the vertex detector
are required to be less than 1%. Major background sources are e± pairs and neutrons
backscattered at the extraction beam line.

The tolerable hit densities of pairs and neutrons of the vertex detector are 1

104/cm2hits/train

×

1010n/cm2/year, respectively, where a train have 2820 bunches with time separation

and 1
of 307.7 nsec. The hit rate corresponds to 1% occupancy.

×

The TPC has 2.46

109 voxels in total, consisting of pads and time-buckets. Tolerance
106 voxels/50µsec,
of background hits is estimated to be 0.5% occupancy, that is 12.3
where the 50 µsec is a full drift time in the TPC. Assuming a hit has 5(pads)
5(buckets),
105 hits/50µsec. From this evaluation, tolerance of

hits in the bucket of a single pad. Neutron tolerance can be estimated to be 4
µsec assuming that a neutron creates 10 hits assuming 100% eﬃciency for neutrons to make
hits which is so called neutron conversion eﬃciency. Since the eﬃciency depends on the gas
content, it has been estimated to 1% with P10-gas in the TPC.

Muons can be serious background in the endcap calorimeters since they hit all the layers
and mimic tracks. Signals can be read out with 100 nsec gate in the calorimeters. Only
one muon can be allowed in the endcap calorimeter of 30 m2 within the gate. Therefore,
tolerance of muons is 0.03 µ/m2/100 nsec .

The tolerances are listed in Table 2.12. They should be further investigated by the full

simulation of Jupiter.

Interaction Region (IR) Design

IR geometries, especially the beam pipe and the innermost radius of VTX, depend on the
machine parameters such as beam energy, intensity and sizes at the interaction point (IP)
as well as crossing angle, distance from IP to the ﬁnal quadrupole magnet (L*) and the
detector solenoid ﬁeld (B). While the accelerator can be seamlessly operated in the parameter
space[5, 41], the present designs were optimized with all the parameter sets at Ecm =500

GeV and 1 TeV, L* = 4.5 m and B = 3 Tesla for physics and background studies. As
explained in the VTX section, the beam pipe inner radius has been determined from the IP
to the ﬁnal focus quadrupole magnet (QD0) by the envelope of pairs [42]. The conﬁguration
of beam pipe is shown in Figure 2.70. The detailed geometrical data are listed together with
the extreme cases of the high luminosity parameter sets and the improved one at Ecm =1
TeV [41] in Table 2.13 . The innermost VTX layer is located to be 0.4 or 0.5 cm from the
beam pipe, e.g.
its radius is 1.7 cm with the beam pipe of 1.3 cm radius at the nominal
set. The standard radii of beam pipe and the innermost VTX layer are 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm,
respectively, for the Jupiter simulation.

is a CH2 (low Z) mask and the blue is the ﬁnal quadrupole magnet(QD0). A pair monitor
is set in front of the CH2 mask, i.e. between J and K.

2.9.3 Collimation Aperture

Synchrotron Radiation

Since the beams are accompanied by halos, they should be sharply collimated at the col-
limation section at upstream in the beam delivery system. The halo particles generate
synchrotron radiations in magnets and muons at the collimators. Collimation apertures
have been optimized for the radiation proﬁle to be small at IR region in order to prevent
the direct hits at beam pipes and inner surfaces of the ﬁnal focus magnets. We adopt the
65σy . The
collimation scheme by A. Drozhdin [43]. The apertures are set to be 8σx ×
properties of major collimators are listed in Table 2.14, where absorbers ( 30 Xo at least )
are installed behind the spoilers of SP2, SP4 and SPEX . Two masks of MSK1 and MSK2
are set to shield IR region against synchrotron radiations at downstream of the last bend
magnets which are located at 96 m from IP.

The synchrotron radiations have been simulated by a Monte Carlo program of LCBDS
[44] based on GEANT4. Transverse proﬁles of the radiations are shown in Figure 2.71, where

The alternative approach of muon attenuators has been investigated in the ACFA-LC
working group [1] . Since the beam delivery system in the previous study [47] is very similar
to the ILC one, the major results can be borrowed in this report. All the empty beam line
is covered by the attenuators which is consisted of two coaxial iron pipes of 8 cm and 78 cm
diameters around the beam pipe of 2 cm diameter. The iron pipes of 244 m toal length are
magnetized at 1 Tesla. As shown in Figure 2.72, the reduction factor of muon ﬂux is close
to that with the muon spoilers.

We are investigating the muon background by using LCBDS.

2.9.4 Crossing Angle and Final Quadrupole Magnet

Two crossing angles have been set to be 2 and 20 mrad as the baseline conﬁguration in the
Baseline Conﬁguration Document [45]. Also the baseline designs of ﬁnal focus quadrupole
magnet have been chosen to be a large bore super-conducting (SC) and a compact SC mag-
nets at the 2 and 20 mrad angles, respectively, while permanent magnets are the alternative
ones for the both angles. Their major geometries are listed in Table 2.15 which are used in
the simulation studies.

With small angle crossing, the most crucial issue is an energy deposit at the SC-QD0
in the extraction beam line. Sources of the energy deposit are pairs, disrupted beam and
radiative Bhabha events. The pairs hit uniformly inside of the QD0 for their low energies, ,
while the disrupted beam hit more at the downstream for higher energies. Table 2.16 lists
energy deposits due to the pairs at QD0 with 2 mrad crossing angle for the parameter sets,
which were calculated by LCBDS. There should be no problem in the cryogenic power with
these heat losses at any parameter sets.

Tolerance of the energy deposit in the SC magnets can be expressed in a unit weight, that
is 0.5 mW/g to break the superconducting state. Since this tolerance has been estimated for
the DC deposit, the ILC bunch-train structure may have more tolerable one. The simulation
shows that pairs deposit energies of less than the tolerance for all the parameter sets even at
Ecm = 1 TeV while the disrupted beam exceeds it in cases of the High Lum a Ecm = 500 GeV
and the Low P, High Lum at Ecm=1 TeV. The High Lum-1 has the marginal deposit energy
at High Lum at Ecm = 1 TeV. This issue requires further study to optimize the conﬁguration

With 20 mrad crossing angle, energy deposits were calculated to be 43mW due to the
pairs at ﬁrst extraction quadrupole magnet ( QDEX1 ) which is located at 3.5 m from IP.
The QDEX1 has aperture of 2.6 cm, outer-diameter of 4.78 cm and length of 2.2 m as listed
in Table 2.15. Since disrupted beam can be focused separately from incoming beam at the
QDEX1, it will not deposit energy more than the tolerance with all the parameter sets.

The typical demagniﬁcation is 0.3% with 1
artiﬁcial vibration for no cooling water and neither electricity. Therefore, it must be a good
alternative option for the QD0 [49] . Since the permanent QD0 is compact, the disrupted
beam can be extracted outside of it as similar to the compact SC one at 20 mrad crossing
angle, where the extraction line has the same conﬁguration as the baseline.
In case of 2
mrad crossing angle, the energy deposit is expected to be greater than the large SC because
of smaller aperture for pairs and disrupted beam. However, the radiation damage must be
irrelevant. Such performances will be investigated by the full simulation together with the
hardware R&D.

In the case of 20 mrad crossing angle, the Detector Integrated Dipole (DID) has been
proposed in order to tune the beam orbits with level collisions, i.e. zero vertical angles,
at IP [50] as well as to reduce the synchrotron radiation eﬀects on the beam sizes. After
SNOWMASS 2005 the intermediate crossing angle of 14mrad has been investigated as the
alternative one for less eﬀects on the orbits and the radiations. Taking account of these

CHAPTER 2. DETECTOR SUB-SYSTEMS

101

improvements, anti-DID, which has opposite sign of the DID magnetic ﬁeld, was proposed
at the 14 mrad crossing angle. An optimization of interaction region was presented at the
NANOBEAM 2005 [51].

In next section, we evaluate the DID and anti-DID in terms of backgrounds by simula-

tions.

2.9.5 Background

Hits in VTX and TPC

The incoherent pairs and disrupted beams have been generated with the machine parameter
sets by CAIN. Background hits from them have been calculated by the full detector sim-
ulation of Jupiter as well as the LCBDS . Present results are very preliminary for limited
statistics of the simulation and without optimization of detailed geometries, where a single
bunch collision has been simulated with the parameter sets, 2 mrad and 20 mrad crossing
angles and anti-DID at Ecm = 500 GeV.

The VTX hit density in the ﬁrst layer may exceed the tolerance ( 104/cm2/ train ) at
the high luminosity parameter sets, where the results have large statistical errors. There are
more hits at the outer layers at 20mrad than those of the 2 mrad. The anti-DID actually
reduced the hit densities at the outer layers close to the 2mrad cases .

Number of TPC hits may exceed the tolerance (2.46

105hits/50 µsec) with the high
luminosity and the low P sets and the tolerance is marginal with the 20 mrad crossing cases.
The anti-DID reduces the number of TPC hits below the tolerance, especially in case of the
high luminosity. The low Q parameter set has less hits by more than twice than the nominal
one in VTX and TPC.

×

Energy Deposit in BCAL, Beam Dumps and Neutrons

Neutrons are created by electromagnetic energy deposit in materials with typical rate of
130 neutrons(n)/TeV, which corresponds to 109n/J . The pairs, disrupted beams and beam-
strahlung photons hit the calorimeters (BCAL), magnets at the extraction line and the beam
dumps, where they deposit energies for neutrons to be created. The neutrons are backscat-
tered into the VTX around IP. Assuming they scatter uniformly in all solid angle, their ﬂux
density at the VTX (IP) is in inverse proportion to L2, where L is distance from the creation
point to IP. The tolerance is estimated to be 1010/cm2/year in the VTX. With the above
consideration, tolerable energy deposit can be expressed by E = 0.13 L2 with E in Watt(W)
and L in m, e.g. 0.13 W and 1 KW at L = 1 m and 88 m, respectively.

Energy deposits in BCAL are listed with various conditions in Table 2.17 .
In reality, a fraction of neutrons comes out in backward from the material. Therefore,
the above estimation is the conservative limit of energy deposit from the VTX damage. For
examples, it has been shown that neutrons were backscattered from the nearest quadrupole
magnet in JLC detector with rates of 8.1 n/TeV and 36 n/TeV by simulations of GEANT3
and FLUKA, respectively [1]. In this case, the fractions are 0.06 and 0.28, respectively. Also
the fraction from the water beam dump was estimated to be 1.67

4.

10−

At ILC, total energy deposit is 23 MW at the beam dump. Since the dump is located
at 650 m and 300 m from IP at the 2 mrad and 20 mrad crossing angles, respectively, the
tolerances are estimated to be 330 MW and 70 MW, respectively, with the fraction of the

Physics Performance

3.1 Tools for Studies of Physics Performances

The detector conﬁguration used for physics performance studies of the GLD detector pre-
sented in this chapter is summarized in Table 3.1. A cut view of the detector is shown in
Figure 3.1. The studies used the software modules QuickSim, JUPITER and SATELLITES
implemented in the JSF [54] framework unless speciﬁed otherwise. These tools are described
brieﬂy in this section before describing results in the subsequent sections.

JUPITER [54] is a full detector simulator based on Geant4 [53]. For this study, we used
version 7.0patch1. JUPITER provides a modular structure for easy update and installation of
sub-detector components. To this end, powerful base classes have been developed including:
a uniﬁed interface to facilitate easy installation of detector components, classes to help
implementation of detailed hierarchical structures, automatic naming system and material
management to minimize user-written source codes, and a mechanism to compose magnetic
ﬁelds of many accelerator components. Detector conﬁgurations are deﬁned by a external
text ﬁle to allow easy modiﬁcation of detector conﬁguration.
JSF is an analysis framework based on ROOT [55].

It provides a generic framework
for event generation, simulation and analysis. Event generator modules in JSF for Pythia
[62] and other generator data in various format are used in our studies. JUPITER was used
within a JSF framework to create Monte Carlo simulated data in ROOT format. The analysis
packages, SATELLITES and URANUS, for JUPITER data are prepared as JSF modules.
The URANUS package is a collection of analysis modules which would be applicable even
for real data, while the SATELLITES package are modules derived from URANUS adding
functions speciﬁc to analyses of simulation data.

Modules in SATELLITES includes those for Tracking, Calorimeter clustering, particle
ﬂow analysis and jet clustering of particle ﬂow objects. In tracking, we make Kalman ﬁlter ﬁts
of smeared hit points simulated for the Vertex detector (VTX), Intermediate Tracker(IT) and
Central Tracker(TPC) detectors. For the hit point selection, Monte Carlo truth information
was used. A description of a generic Kalman ﬁtter program used for this analysis can be
found in ref. [56]. The particle ﬂow analysis is described in the subsequent section.

For high statistic estimates of physics performance, we used a fast detector simulator,
QuickSim [54]. Detector components included in QuickSim are for the tracking detectors,
TPC, IT and VTX, and for the calorimeter system. In QuickSim, particles are swam through
VTX, IT, and TPC to CAL, taking into accounts smearing of particle direction by multiple

scattering in materials. Hits in VTX and IT are created as a particle traverses them. When
a particle reaches the TPC, its momentum information at the entrance is used to generate
5 element helix parameters and error matrix taking into account smearing due to multiple
scattering and measurement errors, σrφ and σz, assuming equal-spacing hit point measure-
ments along particle trajectory in TPC. These smeared TPC tracks and smeared hit points
in VTX and IT are used later to get a combined track parameter of charged particles. When
a particle reaches the calorimeter a lateral distribution of hit cells is generated as a sum of
double Gaussian distribution, then the energy of each cells are smeared with given energy
resolution parameter. For simplicity, electrons and gammas create signals only in the electro-
magnetic calorimeter, while muons and neutrinos do not generate signals in the calorimeter
system. The remaining hadronic particles create signals in the hadron calorimeter only.

3.2 Performance for Single Particles

Materials for the GLD detector up to the EM calorimeter is shown in Figure 3.2 in terms
of radiation lengths. The total material budget is about 0.1 to 0.2 X0 depending on cos θ,
except at cos θ = 0, where thin TPC central membrane ( < 100 µm ) extends from radius
of about 40 cm to about 200 cm resulting 5.4 X0. In real experiment, the probability of
particles goes into this membrane is small and not shown in the ﬁgure. Materials in terms of
nuclear interaction lengths are shown in Figure 3.3. The total is about 0.02 to 0.05 except
at cos θ = 0 where TPC central membrane has about 2.8 λ contribution.

The momentum resolution for muons produced at 90◦ is shown in Figure 3.4(A) for the
cases of TPC only, TPC and IT, and TPC, IT and VTX combined [57]. To avoid particles
hitting the TPC central membrane, particles are generated from a point slightly away from

the case of the standard conﬁguration. For the conﬁguration shown by the blue curve, the
inner radius of the innermost VTX layer is 1.7 cm, those of 5th and 6th layers are same
as the standard, and that of 3rd and 4th layers are adjusted so that to have equal distance
between 2nd and 3rd, and 4th and 5th layers. In the case of the purple curve, the inner
radius of 1st layer is move to 2.4cm, while radius of remaining layers are adjusted similar to
the blue curve case.

The energy resolutions of the EM and HD calorimeters are shown in Figure 3.5 as a
function of particle energies. In the study of the energy resolution of EM calorimeter, the
range cut value for the Geant4 simulation was 10 µm, instead of default 1mm. This was
necessary to obtain the energy resolution consistent with the beam test results. The energy
resolution of the hadron calorimeter is show in Figure 3.5B, together with the beam test
result with similar conﬁguration. It is well known that results of the hadron shower program
in Geant4 depends on the physics list. We compared models such as QGSP, LHEP and
Jupiter physics lists (J4PhysicsList), but none of them reproduced the beam data resolution
at high energies. In the Jupiter simulation, the Jupiter physics list derived from a Geant4
novice example is used as a default.

3.3 Jet Energy Resolution

To achieve good resolution for jet energy measurements particle ﬂow analysis (PFA) is crucial.
In the PFA analysis, energies of charged particles are measured by trackers and neutral
particle energies are measured by the calorimeter system. Since the calorimeter is sensitive
to charged particles, removal of charged particle energy depositions in the calorimeter is
essential. We used two methods for the PFA, cheated method [58] and realistic method [60],
which will be discussed in the following subsections.

3.3.1 Resolution by cheated PFA

In the cheated method, cluster reconstruction and linking of charged track and calorimeter
cluster for removal of charged track signals is pursued based on the Monte Carlo information.
This gives optimistic estimates of the jet energy resolution, but still includes eﬀects such as
shower ﬂuctuation in calorimeter, signal overlaps in readout cells of calorimeter, particle
decays in tracker, etc.

→

In this study, we generated e+e−

q ¯q events at center of mass energies of 91.17 GeV,
350 GeV and 500 GeV. Only u, d, s quarks were generated by Pythia [62] without initial
state radiation. Generated events were simulated by JUPITER and reconstructed by the
SATELLITES analysis modules . In this analysis charged particles measured by the TPC
were ﬁtted and connected to IT and VTX hits by the Kalman track ﬁtter to make a combined
track parameter, called hybrid track parameter. Hit points of candidate tracks were selected
based on the Monte Carlo truth information.

In the JUPITER simulation, we kept an ID of tracks at the exit of the TPC sensitive
volume and the ID is attached to each Calorimeter cells. This ID information was used to
form a calorimeter cluster. If a track with the same ID is found in the TPC, the cluster in
the calorimeter is deleted. If a track kinks in the TPC sensitive volume, we are left with a
track before the kink (kink mother), a track after the kink (kink daughter) with a connected
neutral cluster in the calorimeter, and the neutral cluster(neutral daughter) which might be
produced at the kink. In this case, we used the track information of the kink mother and
the neutral daughters for the PFO(kink mother scheme), instead of using the kink daughter
and neutral daughters(kink daughter scheme). The kink mother scheme double counts the
energies of neutral daughters, but the energy resolution was about 3% better than the link
daughter scheme according to our study.

The jet energy resolution obtained by the cheated PFA algorithm is shown in Figure 3.6.

curves shown in the ﬁgure are gaussian ﬁts in the two σ range from mean values. Fits were
repeated until the conversion of σ. The widths of the jet energy distribution obtained from
the ﬁts are summarized in the Table.3.2. As seen in the table, the energy resolution for jets
at the Z pole is about 26%/√E and worsens slightly to about 30%/√E at 500 GeV. In the
table, the resolution for the case of QuickSim are shown in the same table for comparison.
For QuickSim, we prepared two parameter sets, the good one for performance similar to the
cheated PFA performance and the bad one corresponding to the realistic PFA resolution
which will be discussed in the next subsection. The performance by the cheated PFA is
the ultimate jet energy resolution with the current detector conﬁguration which could be
achieved by a clever PFA algorithm. The performance of the realistic PFA is limited by the
performance of the PFA algorithm which will be improved in future developments. Final
performance would be somewhere between two performances, thus, we will prepared two sets
of QuickSim parameters to give optimistic and pessimistic estimates of physics performances.

Factors which aﬀect the performance of the cheated PFA are summarized in Table.3.3.
In the table, the neutrino column shows the contribution of undetected-neutrino energies to

pt less than 230 MeV. These contributions were studied based on generator data of Z pole
events. In the GLD, particles with pt less than 230 MeV is not reconstructed by TPC. If this
cut oﬀ is reduced to 100 MeV by utilizing the track ﬁnding by IT, the contribution to the jet
mass resolution from pt cut oﬀ is reduced to 0.4 GeV. On the other hand, it increases to 1.2
GeV, if a 5 Tesla solenoid ﬁeld is used instead of 3 Tesla and only TPC track ﬁnder is used.
Major contributions to the jet energy resolution are those by a ﬂuctuation of measurement
energies in EM Calorimeter and Hadron Calorimeter, which are indicated by EM CAL and
HD CAL in the Table.3.3. These contributions were estimated by using particle energies at
the entrance of the calorimeter, instead of energies measured by the scintillators.

3.3.2 Realistic PFA

The GLD-PFA mainly consists of three parts: photon ﬁnding, charged hadron ﬁnding and
neutral hadron ﬁnding. The photon ﬁnding is based on a calorimeter hit cluster. A small
cluster is formed by the so called nearest-neighbor clustering method. Further clustering
is performed by collecting the small clusters within a certain tube region. A cluster due
to photon is then identiﬁed by using the cluster information such as longitudinal energy
proﬁle. Details of the photon ﬁnding can be found in [59]. After the photon ﬁnding, the
charged hadron ﬁnding is performed. A charged track is extrapolated to the calorimeter,
and distance between a calorimeter hit cell and the extrapolated track is calculated. The
distance is calculated for any track/calorimeter cell combination. The calorimeter hit cells
within a certain tube radius are connected to form a charged hadron cluster. Note that the
tube radius for the ECAL and HCAL can be changed separately. Details of the charged
hadron ﬁnding can be found in [60, 61]. After the charged hadron ﬁnding, the remaining
calorimeter hits are classiﬁed into a hit due to a neutral hadron or a “satellite” hit due to
a charged hadron. This is done by using a velocity and energy density information. The
calculated velocity and energy density distribution can be found in Fig. 3.7.

Performance of the GLD-PFA is studied by using Z

q ¯q events at the center of mass
energy of 91.2GeV. Note that the calorimeter conﬁguration in the Jupiter is tower geometry

and cell size for ECAL and HCAL is 4 cm

Performance of each tool described above is summarized in Table 3.4. The left most column
shows a particle type identiﬁed by the GLD-PFA. The energy weighted eﬃciency (EXXX)
for the photon ﬁnding, charged hadron ﬁnding and neutral hadron ﬁnding are 85.2%, 84.4%
and 60.5%, respectively. The energy weighted purity (PXXX) for the photon ﬁnding, charged
hadron ﬁnding and neutral hadron ﬁnding are 92.2%, 91.9% and 62.2%, respectively. Note
that if satellites hits are included in the charged hadron, we gain 10% eﬃciency at a cost of
3% purity loss for the charged hadron ﬁnding. Figure 3.8 shows the energy sum for the Z
pole events when the GLD-PFA is applied. 38%/√E energy resolution is achieved by using
the PFA while that of energy sum in the calorimeter is 60%/√E.

The upper left, upper right, bottom left and bottom right histogram show the case of 30µm,
60µm, 90µm and 120µm, respectively. Notice that default resolution is 150µm.

Beam parameters compared in Figures 3.10 and 3.11 and Tables 3.6 and 3.7 are the
case without the beamstrahlung eﬀect ( ISR only), with the ”Nominal” pararameter and
”HighLum” parameter at ECM = 350 GeV, and the ”Nominal” parameter case at ECM = 250
GeV. Beamstrahlung spectrum ”Nominal”and ”HighLum” at 350 GeV and 250 GeV are
calculated by the program, CAIN, using the parameters deﬁned in ref.[5], except the center
of mass energy. The diﬀerence of the speciﬁc luminosity at diﬀerent energy is not considered
1. The width of Higgs distribution
and all results based on the integrated luminosity of 500 fb−
at 350 GeV in Table 3.6 and Figure 3.10 show that the beamstralung eﬀect increase the
width signiﬁcantly, but it is small at 250 GeV thanks to the higher cross section and better
momentum resolution due to lower lepton energies near threshold.

3.4.2 Vertex Charge Reconstruction

Quark charge sign selection is an essential tool for a number of physics analyses allowing e.g.
the unfolding of cross-sections, measurement of spin correlations or angular analysis [63]. It
is among the benchmarks for vertex detector performance [64]. For b-ﬂavour jets, the sign of
quark charge for the 40% of jets can be obtained by reconstructing the vertex charge, i.e. the
sum of the charges of all tracks assigned to the B-hadron decay chain, as described in detail
elsewhere [65]. Depending on all tracks in the decay chain being correctly distinguished from
IP tracks, an eﬃciency of vertex charge reconstruction is sensitive to the radius of the inner
vertex detector layer and to multiple scattering eﬀects [66].

Vertex charge reconstruction was studied using jets from e+e−

b¯b events generated
using the fast simulation SGV [67], interfaced to PYTHIA version 6.1.52 [68]. The vertex
ﬁnder ZVTOP [69] was run on all tracks assigned to a jet by the JADE algorithm [70].

→

The performance of the GLD baseline vertex detector in terms of vertex charge recon-
struction was studied as function of polar angle and jet energy. The leakage rate λ, deﬁned
as probability of reconstructing a neutral B hadron as charged, was used to characterise de-
tector performance. Figure 3.12 shows the angular and jet energy dependence for the GLD
vertex detector compared to the vertex detectors of the SiD and LDC concept studies. All
three vertex detectors were embedded in the same ’global detector geometry’, corresponding
to the TESLA detector design [2]. At a jet energy of 50 GeV, typical in multi-jet processes
at the ILC, one ﬁnds a leakage rate of λ
10 % in the central region of the detector, de-
< 0.9 due to increased lever arm from the IP and multiple
grading to 25 % for 0.85 <
scattering eﬀects. When averaging over 0 <
8 % at
the highest jet energy considered, Ejet = 250 GeV, to
20 % for 25 GeV jets. Those low
energy jets contain more low-momentum tracks, which are more easily lost from the B decay

chain; also those jets are broader and hence more often contain tracks outside the angular
acceptance of the detector.

Compared to the LDC vertex detector the current GLD detector design performs less
well. The main reason for this is the larger inner layer radius of the GLD detector, which is
needed because of its lower B ﬁeld of 3 T. Performance of the GLD and the SiD, averaged
over polar angle, is similar, with the GLD being worse than the SiD in the central region due
to its larger radius, but better as one moves to the detector edge, where SiD performance
is given by measurements in the vertex detector disks, which is impaired by the amount
of material at the end of the short SiD barrel staves. While this study clearly shows some
trends that ought to be taken into account in the further design, it should be noted that
it is currently based on a fast simulation, and that diﬀerences between the global detectors
were not considered. Furthermore, the diﬀerences are important only for events with high
b¯b at high energy, the measurement
jet multiplicity. For two-jet processes such as e+e−
of vertex charge is insensitive to the diﬀerent vertex detector options.

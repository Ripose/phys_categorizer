Oﬀ line Parallax Correction for Neutral Particle
Gas Detectors.

P. Van Esch

February 2, 2008

Abstract

In a neutral particle gas detector, the parallax error resulting from the
perpendicular projection on the detection plane or wire of the radial par-
ticle trajectories emanating from a point like source (such as a scattering
sample) can signiﬁcantly spoil the apparent angular resolution of the de-
tector. However, as we will show, the information is not lost. We propose
an oﬀ line data treatment to restore as much as possible the original scat-
tering information in the case of a one-dimensional parallax eﬀect. The
reversibility of parallax follows from the algebraic structure of this eﬀect,
which is diﬀerent from the resolution loss which is essentially irreversible.
The interplay between ﬁnite resolution and parallax complicates the issue,
but this can be resolved.

1 Introduction

The parallax eﬀect occurs when a point like source emits radiation along spher-
ically radial lines, which is then detected by a detector with ﬁnite thickness
and whose detection mechanism projects this radial trajectory onto a plane or
onto a line (wire). This typically occurs in gas detectors of neutral particles, as
shown in ﬁgure 1: the neutral particle follows its radial trajectory throughout
the ’conversion volume’ where it suﬀers an exponentially distributed probability
to give rise to a cloud of electrical charge (to convert). This charge then follows
electrical drift ﬁeld lines until it reaches a position sensitive detection element
(such as a wire or a micro strip detection element). Usually, for construction
reasons, these drift ﬁeld lines are perpendicular to the detection surface or line.
So the conversion point (which is randomly distributed along the radial line)
will be projected perpendicularly onto the detection element. A narrow particle
beam will thus give rise to a smeared-out spot. This smearing-out eﬀect is called
the parallax eﬀect. One tends to confuse it often with resolution loss, but we will
show in this paper that the algebraic structure of the operator corresponding to
’parallax eﬀect’ is reversible, while ’resolution loss’ is essentially irreversible. We
will also work out the reverse operation in theory and in a simulated example.

We haven’t found much literature concerning this issue ; the idea of inverting
the parallax operator was suggested in [1] in a JINR internal report; but it was
speciﬁed that the method gave problems when the detector had ﬁnite resolution.
Most people try to correct the detector hardware to avoid parallax, such as [2]
and [3] by adapting the entire detection volume, or [4], taken over by [5], by
trying to correct for the electric ﬁeld projection. An overview of hardware
correction techniques is given in the review [6].

In this paper we will focus on the algebraic structure of the parallax eﬀect
on the image, and how to inverse it, even in the case of ﬁnite resolution. We
will work out explicitly the case of two geometries: a rectangular volume with
projection perpendicular on a plane, and a cylindrical volume with projection
onto a wire. In both cases, we only consider the parallax in one dimension. We
will subdivide this relevant dimension in 128 position bins, so an image consists
of 128 intensities. We will have the ’true image’ Itrue(n) which represents the
intensity of entering neutral particles in each bin (at the entrance window level).
We have the conversion image Ipara(n), which is the perpendicular projection
of the conversion points, due to the parallax eﬀect. Finally, we have the raw
image, Iraw(n), which is the conversion image with the ﬁnite resolution of the
detection element.

2 Algebraic structure of the parallax and reso-

lution operators.

2.1 Resolution and convolution.

In the continuum limit (an inﬁnite number of inﬁnitesimal bins), ﬁnite resolution
comes down to the convolution of the original image with the point response of
the detector describing its resolution. This point response is usually very well
modelled by a gaussian distribution but this can be any function with a single
extremum. This operation can be seen as the application of a linear operator
on the image function:

iinstrument(x) =

dyg(x − y)itrue(y)

Z

(1)

As it is well known, the translation invariance of this operator results in eigen-
functions which are complex exponentials; in other words, the operator is made
diagonal by a Fourier transform. The discrete version of this operation in the
case of an inﬁnite train of samples, or a ﬁnite number of cyclic samples, is at
the heart of digital signal processing, as explained in [7]. We work however with
a ﬁnite number of bins in our detector, which are not to be considered cyclic.
As such, Fourier representation (or the Z-transform) cannot really be applied
so we have to consider the operator on the image as a general linear operator:

iinstrument(n) =

gn,kitrue(k)

(2)

N

Xk=1

The square matrix gn,k then consists of columns which are given by:

gn,k = G(n − k)

(3)

and G(l) is the sampled point response of the detector. There is still of course
a spectral representation: the eigenvalues of the matrix gn,k. This spectral rep-
resentation is what comes closest to the Fourier representation. As an example,
let us consider 128 bins with G(k) = e− k2
4 . This is a gaussian point response
that has a full width half maximum of 3.3 bins. The matrix gn,k is a symmet-
rical matrix if the point resolution function is symmetrical. Constructing the
corresponding matrix, and solving for the eigenvalues, we ﬁnd the distribution
given in ﬁgure 2. If this were a true Fourier representation, we would talk about
a low pass ﬁlter. The ratio of the highest to the lowest eigenvalue is about 104,
which indicates that this is a highly irreversible operator in practice. This is
somehow normal: a low pass ﬁlter has irreversibly cut away the high frequency
components. In our case, it has irreversibly cut away the projection onto the
eigenvector images corresponding to the small eigenvalues.

2.2 The parallax operator.

The parallax eﬀect, even in the continuum limit, can not be written as a convo-
lution of the image with a kind of ’parallax kernel function’, because the parallax
eﬀect is strongly position dependent. But of course it is still a linear operator,
so we can write its eﬀect always as:

iinstrument(n) =

pn,kitrue(k)

(4)

N

Xk=1

Because even in the continuum limit this operator is not a convolution,
there is no remote resemblance to a Fourier representation. In order to look
closer at the structure of the matrix p, we will have to think about the physical
process that is at the origin of the parallax eﬀect. We will assume, as shown
in ﬁgure 1, that bin 1 of our 128 bins is perfectly perpendicular to the sample
ray, so that no parallax occurs, and that the eﬀect becomes stronger because
the projection direction deviates more and more from the radial direction as
the bin number increases. The general structure of the matrix pn,k is a sparse
lower-triangular matrix, each column containing the ’parallax tail’ of a thin ray
leaking in the next few bins. The diagonal elements are nothing else but the
fraction of particles in the ray hitting bin k that will also convert in bin k. This
is determined by the geometry of the conversion volume, its binning and the
absorption law for the neutral particles. The diagonal elements, which are also
the eigenvalues for a triangular matrix, will not vary wildly. In ﬁgure 2, the
eigenvalues of such an operator are displayed. It is from this observation that
the reversibility of the parallax eﬀect results. Indeed, the eigenvalues all having
comparable values, the condition number of the matrix will not be very high,
and the inverse matrix will be numerically very well deﬁned. A remark is maybe

due: although very regular, the matrix may be badly scaled, so some care is
to be taken in choosing the numerical inversion technique. If the detector had
perfect resolution (meaning that G(m) ≈ δm,0), then this would be the end of
the story.

2.3 Combination of resolution and parallax.

In the previous two subsections we analyzed the algebraic structure of the linear
operator G that implements ﬁnite resolution of the detector and the operator P
that implements the parallax eﬀect. But in a real detector, both eﬀects occur.
From the diﬀerent structure of the eigenvectors, it is clear that G and P do not
commute. We will assume here that the ﬁnite resolution is an eﬀect that occurs
after the parallax eﬀect has had its eﬀect, as usually is the case in neutral (and
even sometimes in charged) particle detectors:
indeed, the trajectory of the
primary particle, before conversion into a charge cloud, is usually only aﬀected
by the geometry (parallax). Most other (resolution) eﬀects (ﬁnite spread of
charge, diﬀusion, electronic noise etc...) occur afterwards. We hence have:

Ipara = P Itrue

(5)

and:

Iraw = GIpara = GP Itrue
Because G is nearly singular, we can’t inverse the last equation, so our hope
to recover Itrue from Iraw vanishes. But that is normal, we know that we will
suﬀer from the resolution loss, and the parallax eﬀect will certainly not improve
on this. However, we would like to recover Inopara = GItrue, that is, the image
that has the resolution of the detector but doesn’t suﬀer from parallax anymore.

Formally, can write:

Inopara = G(GP )

−1Iraw

but again, because of the singular character of G this is not workable as such.
It would have been if P and G commuted, but they don’t. However, we can
now apply a truncated singular value decomposition on GP as explained in [8]:

GP ≈ U T ΣV

where we limit the diagonal matrix Σ to those eigenvalues of GP that are
signiﬁcant (it is our choice to specify what we call signiﬁcant: usually, given the
numerical precision of the data on which we will work, something of the order
of 1% or 10% will do). What has been done here is replacing the numerically
near-singular matrix GP by a numerically regular matrix Σ of lower rank (the
number of accepted eigenvalues), and two orthogonal projection operators U
and V . As such, we can work out equation 7:

Inopara ≈ Isol = GV T Σ

−1U Iraw

The solution proposed in equation 9 is numerically stable, but one should keep
in mind that it is an approximation. Indeed, eigenvectors of GP with a small
eigenvalue (which are thrown away in the truncated singular value decomposi-
tion) could have large parts of eigenvectors of G with large eigenvalues, hence
contributing to the solution. However, there is no way to calculate in a numeri-
cally stable way these contributions, so there’s more chance that they introduce
spurious terms than improve upon the solution. By using a truncated singular
value decomposition, we’ve thrown away all these potentially dangerous contri-
butions, but at the same time also their true contribution.

3 Test cases.

3.1 Case of a rectangular drift volume.

To calculate the parallax operator in the case of a rectangular drift volume, we
consider a ray k that hits the entrance window in the middle of the kth bin and
calculate the distances sj travelled on this ray from that point on to each of
the bin boundaries. The entry in the matrix for a particular bin is then simply
given by:

pk+j,k = e−µsj − e−µsj+1
This corresponds to the probability of conversion in bin k + j. We consider the
example of a rectangular drift volume with depth 3cm, a height of 40cm divided
into 128 position bins and a sample distance of 40cm. The absorption coeﬃcient
is put to 0.4 absorption lengths per cm. The resolution of the detector (FWHM)
is 3.7 bins. If we just generate a test picture, and see how the picture is aﬀected
if (1) we only had the ﬁnite resolution of the detector, or if (2) we had parallax
and the ﬁnite resolution of the detector, we obtain the images displayed in

case we only apply the ﬁnite resolution of the detector, in the second case we
apply ﬁrst the parallax eﬀect and second the ﬁnite resolution, giving us the
simulated raw data.

ﬁgure 3. When we now apply our technique as given in formula 9, even making
an error and assuming a better resolution of 2.9 bins instead of the simulated
3.7 bins, and using a relative cutoﬀ of 5% (so we reject eigenvalues of the GP
operator which are more than 20 times smaller than the largest eigenvalue), we
can restore the image. Comparing it to the image we would have obtained with
that detector if it had ﬁnite resolution, but no parallax eﬀect, we obtain ﬁgure
4: the reconstruction is almost perfect.

In order to test the practical robustness of our technique, we introduce errors
on some parameters for the parallax operator used during reconstruction. The
sample distance is increased from 40cm to 43cm and the absorption coeﬃcient is
changed from 0.4 into 0.45 absorption lengths per cm. We also add random noise
to the raw data (we added a uniformly distributed noise of relative intensity 2%).
We apply the technique keeping the tolerance to 5%. We still obtain an image
of reasonable quality, as shown in ﬁgure 5. Note that the small overall decrease
in amplitude is normal due to the diﬀerent absorption coeﬃcients. The peaks at
the right hand side are still well resolved, in the right position and of the correct
relative amplitudes and widths, which is usually the information extracted in
scattering experiments.

3.2 Case of a cylindrical detector.

We now consider a cylindrical geometry, with projection of the charges perpen-
dicular onto a central wire. Although the geometry is more complicated in this
case, and although now we have to consider not a ray (line) but a plane of radi-
ation cutting through the entire cylinder, the idea behind the calculation of the
parallax matrix elements is the same: a plane of radiation hitting (at the front

Figure 6: Cylindrical detector: the extracted picture from the raw data using
our method is compared to what the detector would have done if there was

the raw data.

part of the cylinder) the middle of bin k will give rise to a certain probability
of detection in the next few cells, and a geometrical calculation (together with
an exponential absorption law) will allow us to obtain the parallax operator.

We’ve applied this to the following case: a tube of radius 1.2cm, of length
40cm, divided into 128 bins and a sample distance of 40cm. The absorption
coeﬃcient has been taken to be 0.4 absorption lengths per cm. We take the
true resolution of the detector to be (FWHM) 3.7 bins.

Again introducing geometrical and detector parameter errors in the recon-
struction to test practical robustness, we use an erroneous resolution of 2.9 bins
instead of 3.7, together with a sample distance position of 42cm instead of 40cm,
an absorption coeﬃcient of 0.45 absorption lengths per cm instead of 0.4, and
we add 2% of relative noise to the raw data. We use a cutoﬀ of the singular
values at 5% again. We then arrive at a restored image as shown in ﬁgure 6,
which still gives a satisfying result, and the same comments apply as in the case
of a rectangular detector volume.

4 Discussion.

After a theoretical explanation, we’ve tried to show, at the hand of realistic
case studies, that even a severe parallax eﬀect does not completely spoil the
resolution of the image, and that useful information can be extracted, using the
proposed inversion technique. Sometimes some tuning of the tolerance allowed
in the truncated singular value decomposition is needed (especially in diﬃcult

9

cases of strong parallax, badly known detector parameters and noisy data) in
order to get most out of the data. We have to warn that we noticed that in the
case of severe errors on the detector parameters, or very high levels of statistical
noise, some small oscillations appear in the restored picture. So this technique
works best when we know rather well the detector parameters and have data
of relatively high statistical quality, even if the parallax eﬀect is strong. Of
course preventing parallax (using clever detector and instrument construction)
is always better than to cure it, but we tried to show in this paper that a cure
is possible for existing (or future) instruments and data suﬀering from parallax.

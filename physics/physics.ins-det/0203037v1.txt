This paper describes the construction and optimization of a Langmuir-Taylor detector for lithium,
using a rhenium ribbon. The absolute detection probability of this very sensitive detector is mea-
sured and the dependence of this probability with oxygen pressure and surface temperature is
studied. Sources of background signal and their minimization are also discussed in details. And
a comparison between our data concerning the response time of the detector and literature values
is given. A theoretical analysis has been made: this analysis supports the validity of the Saha-
Langmuir law to relate the ionization probability to the work function. Finally, the rapid variations
of the work function with oxygen pressure and temperature are explained by a chemical equilibrium
model.

INTRODUCTION

ground and limits the detection of a very low atomic
ﬂux.

Very sensitive detectors for neutral atoms, which were
ﬁrst necessary for Rabi experiments (see reviews in ref.
[1, 2]), still govern the feasibility of many experiments.
Two diﬀerent detectors fulﬁll the requirements of high
eﬃciency and low background:

•

•

the Langmuir-Taylor detector [3, 4, 5] is based on
the surface ionization process. For ground state
atoms, the ionization probability is large when the
ionization potential is low. Therefore, this detec-
tor is mostly used with alkali atoms. For thermal
atoms, the detection probability is almost indepen-
dent of their velocities. The detection of a few
atoms per second is feasible, if the produced ions
are detected with an electron multiplier.

the laser induced ﬂuorescence detector, which is
commonly used in cold atom experiments, has a
detection probability close to 100% for slow atoms.
However, its detection probability decreases rapidly
with the atom velocity and a large eﬃciency is very
diﬃcult to achieve for thermal atoms. Finally, laser
stray light is usually the dominant source of back-

Therefore, the Langmuir-Taylor detector is probably
the best detector for thermal alkali atomic beams. Op-
timization of this detector is more diﬃcult in the case of
lithium, because lithium has the highest ionization po-
tential of the alkali atoms. In the present paper, we give
a detailed description of the detector in this case. More
precisely, after the introduction, we describe the detector
principle and its design in part 2. In part 3, we present
our measurements of the detection probability, which de-
pends on the degree of oxidation of rhenium surface [6, 7].
The various sources of background signal and their min-
imization are described in part 4, while, in part 5, we
discuss the detector response time. In part 6, these ob-
servations are rationalized by a theoretical modeling of
the surface ionization process. Two appendices present
complementary information: appendix A discusses the
relation between heating current and rhenium ribbon
temperature and appendix B brieﬂy analyzes literature
data concerning the dependence of rhenium work func-
tion with surface oxidation [7, 9, 10, 11].

All the information needed to optimize this detector
is thus collected and analyzed in the present paper. A
recent paper by F. Stienkemeier et al. [12] has described
the Langmuir-Taylor detector, using a rhenium surface,
applied to detect various atoms (including lithium) at-
tached to helium droplets. Our measurements and anal-

ysis are largely complementary to those of this work.

A. Detector principle

Surface ionization of an atom A occurs if the ioniza-
tion potential I of the atom is comparable to the work
function Φ of the metal. The atom is then emitted as
a positive ion A+ with a probability P+ and as a neu-
tral atom with the probability (1
P+). The probability
P+ is usually assumed to be given by the Saha-Langmuir
law:

where g0 and g+ are the statistical weights of the ion
and atom ground states (in the case of alkali atoms,
g0/g+ = 2). The validity of this law is discussed in part
6. The wire temperature must be high, typically 1500
K or larger, not because of its inﬂuence on the ionized
fraction P+, but to reduce the ion residence time on the
surface. This residence time τ is given by:

τ = τ0 exp (Eads/kBT )

(2)

Here Eads is the ion adsorption energy (typically a few
eV) and τ0 should be close to the vibrational period of the
ion near the surface (near 10−13 s, see table 2). Finally,
the ionization probability is independent of the initial
kinetic energy as long as this energy is smaller than or
comparable to the adsorption energy, because the resi-
dence time on the surface is suﬃcient to insure thermal
equilibrium with the surface.

≈

5.9

Because of the high ionization potential of lithium,
ILi = 5.392 eV, we need a metal with a large work func-
tion Φ. Among refractory metals, the highest values of
the work function are for platinum (Φ = 5.77 eV), irid-
ium (Φ = 5.70 eV) [13], rhenium (Φ = 4.96 eV) and
tungsten (Φ = 4.54 eV) [11]. Moreover, oxidation in-
6 eV following
creases the tungsten work function (Φ
N. F. Ramsey [2], Φ
6.2 eV following H. Pauly
−
and J. P. Toennies [14]) and a similar eﬀect occurs for
rhenium [6, 7, 8, 11].
In appendix B, we discuss the
dependence of rhenium work function with temperature
and oxygen partial pressure: this information supports
strongly the idea that rhenium is probably the best ma-
terial for a lithium detector. The work function is also
a function of the alkali surface coverage [7, 8, 13]. This
eﬀect is very important if one uses a high ﬂux especially
when the residence time is long (i.e. at low temperature)
but it is usually negligible for a high sensitivity detector
dedicated to very low atomic ﬂux.

≈

B. Detector design

The central part of the detector is a rhenium ribbon.
The ribbon thickness a must be quite small, to facili-
tate resistive heating and cleaning (see part 4), while the
width b is ﬁxed by experimental needs. For example, we
use commercially available ribbons with a = 0.0008” =
20.3 µm and b = 0.040” = 1016 µm provided by A. D.
Mackay or a = 30 µm and b = 760 µm provided by
Goodfellow. The ribbon is a few centimeters long. It is
heated by circulating a DC current of a few amperes, nec-
essary to reach the operating temperature T
1500 K.
In appendix A, we discuss the relation between the cur-
rent and the ribbon temperature. Higher temperatures
2200 K) are needed during the cleaning process. At
(T
T = 2000 K, the power per unit length is about 5 W/cm
and this heat load may induce some outgassing of the
vacuum tank.

≥

≃

The ribbon expansion [15, 16] when going from ordi-
nary temperature to a temperature near 2000 K is close
to 1%. Usually, the ribbon is kept straight by a soft
spring, with an applied force less than 1 Newton (for
data concerning the mechanical strength of rhenium, see
ref. [15, 16]). In our arrangement, the rhenium ribbon is
spot-welded at both ends to tantalum sheets.

The ions emitted by the wire are collected and focussed
on the entrance funnel of a channeltron, by a simple ion
optics, as shown in ﬁgure 1. The ion trajectories have
been calculated with the SIMION software [17] and this
calculation serves to deﬁne the various electrical poten-
tials, which are further optimized by maximizing the ion
signal. The repeller plate potential must not exceed a
few volts, otherwise the electrons emitted by the hot wire
may ionize the background gas, thus contributing to the
background signal. A fast counting electronics is used to
convert the channeltron pulses into a signal expressed in

III. DETECTION PROBABILITY

The principle of our measurement is to use an eﬀusive
atomic beam of lithium. As the theory of such a beam
is perfectly understood [2], we can calculate the atomic
ﬂux dN/dt reaching the ribbon:

nLivmeana∗/(4π) (nLi is the lithium density in the oven,
8kBT /πm is the mean velocity inside the
vmean =
oven, a∗ is the area of the oven exit hole) and ∆Ω is
the solid angle of the rhenium wire seen from the oven.
In some experiments, we used a piezoelectric slit, whose
width is tunable under vacuum, to reduce this solid an-
gle, thus verifying the detector linearity with the atomic
ﬂux. Under these conditions, the signal remains in the
linearity domain of the channeltron as long as the lithium
oven temperature does not exceed 673 K.

Several equations relating the lithium vapor pressure
to the temperature appear in the literature [18, 19]. Nes-
meyanov [19] considers that the most reliable data cover-
915 K range are represented by the equation:
ing the 735

with the pressure in Torr. We use the perfect gas approx-
imation to convert pressure to density by nLi = pLi/kBT .
As we must extrapolate this equation, we made a laser
absorption experiment with the same atomic beam to
test this extrapolation. Because of laser saturation and
optical pumping, the theoretical description of laser ab-
sorption is not very simple and we use it here just as a
relative measurement. The atomic density n in the beam
is proportional to the absorption:

where I0 and It are the incident and transmitted laser
intensities. This experiment was made in the tempera-

we use the vapor pressure at the highest temperature of
our study. The results of the absorption experiment are
shown in ﬁgure 2 which plots the beam intensity

deduced. These results prove that the lithium pressure
law can be safely extrapolated,for T

On the same ﬁgure, we have plotted the beam intensity

the detection probability was equal to 100%. These re-
sults follow the same slope as the pressure law in this log-
arithmic plot, further supporting the extrapolation of the
pressure law. During this experimental run, the rhenium
ribbon temperature was T = 1590 K and the residual

quantity deduced from the Langmuir-Taylor detector signal,
assuming a 100% eﬃciency. The absorption data prove that
extrapolation of the pressure law is reasonably accurate. The
Langmuir-Taylor detector signals also support the validity of
the extrapolation of this pressure law. Finally, we deduce

(corresponding to pO2 ≈
is mostly air). From this plot, we get the detection prob-
ability D+ = 32
5%. This error bar does not include
the remaining uncertainty on the lithium vapor pressure.
In a second series of experiments, we measured the
detection probability as a function of surface temper-
ature and oxygen pressure: the ﬂux of lithium atoms
impinging on the rhenium ribbon was estimated to be
105 atoms per second. Before each measurement,
5.75
the wire was ﬂashed at T = 2250 K for 2 minutes, then
the heating current was adjusted to reach the working
temperature and oxygen was admitted. After a stabi-
lization period, the ion signal was measured with the
lithium beam on and oﬀ and the background was sub-
stracted. We have varied the rhenium ribbon tempera-
ture in the range 1590
1880 K. Two measurements were
made by introducing oxygen with a leak valve, with oxy-

with our best vacuum (3
10−9 mbar of oxygen, if the residual gas is mostly

air. We thus deduce the detection probability D+, which
is plotted in ﬁgure 3. These new values of the detection

probability and the ﬁrst measurement (D+ = 32
T = 1590 K in our best vacuum) are not in very good
agreement. This discrepancy, which illustrates the dif-
ﬁculty of such absolute measurements, may be due to a

tection chamber (the experiments corresponding to ﬁgure
2 have been made one year before the experiments with
a variable oxygen pressure).

D+ is the product of the ionization probability P+
by an ion counting eﬃciency E+. This eﬃciency com-
bines several experimental factors (ion collection eﬃ-
ciency, channeltron eﬃciency including electronic thresh-
old eﬀects) and all the errors in the estimation of the
atomic ﬂux. We have no way of measuring directly E+,
but the saturation of the detection probability with a
maximum observed value D+ = 0.66 must correspond to
an ionization probability close to 100%, following litera-
ture data [6, 7, 9, 10, 11]. From this remark, we get a
good estimate of the ion counting eﬃciency E+ = 0.71,
this precise value being such that the corresponding P+
values depend smoothly on the rhenium surface oxidized
fraction f deﬁned in Appendix B. This data is analyzed
in part 6.

The experiments of Stienkemeier et al.

[12] involve
lithium atoms attached to helium droplets and the rhe-
nium ribbon is kept in a higher vacuum (residual pressure
10−9 mbar) than in our experiment. The eﬃciency
5
was estimated indirectly by comparison with other alkali
atoms, with a peak value of 10 % near T = 1350 K. This
value, substantially lower than our own, corresponds to
a lower degree of oxidation of the rhenium surface, in
agreement with the use of a higher vacuum.

IV. OPTIMIZATION OF THE BACKGROUND
SIGNAL

The background signal has three main origins:

•

•

•

the components of the background gas with ioniza-
tion potentials below 9 eV can be ionized on the
rhenium surface

a fresh rhenium wire contains a few ppm of alkali
atoms. When the wire is hot, these atoms diﬀuse
inside the wire and reach the surface where they
are emitted as ions

the background depends strongly on the oxidation
of the rhenium ribbon and this can be explained by
the emission of rhenium oxide ions.

We are going to discuss now these three sources of back-
ground signals. All these contributions to the back-
ground signal can be emitted from any point of the rhe-
nium ribbon surface, but the corresponding ions are de-
tected only if they are focused on the channeltron en-
trance funnel. A trick to reduce the background signal
is to limit ion collection to a small part of the rhenium
ribbon. In our case, the ion optics collects the ions emit-
ted by the 5 mm long central part of the ribbon and this
length cannot be much reduced, at least for our applica-
tions.

Ionization of the background gas

Φ > 3 eV i.e.

Surface ionization of many organic molecules is pos-
sible on rhenium surfaces and this technique is well es-
tablished, as reviewed by Zandberg [8]. The ionization
probability of any component of the residual gas de-
pends rapidly on its ionization potential I, through Saha-
Langmuir law (1). For a species with a partial pressure
close to 10−8 mbar, about 5
1011 molecules impinge on
×
a 1 centimeter length of hot wire per second. Assuming
1500K and an oxidized rhenium

surface with Φ
6 eV, the corresponding contribution
to the background remains below 102 ions per second if

9 eV. Various types of or-
ganic molecules have their ﬁrst ionization potential near
this value and can be ionized: a mass spectrum produced
by ionization of the residual gas (produced by oil diﬀu-
sion pumps) on an oxidized tungsten ribbon is shown in
ref. [14] and this spectrum is very dense. It is therefore
very important to operate in a high and clean vacuum,
because an oil-free vacuum contains mostly species with
high ionization potentials (H2, H2O, CO...). Practically,
the detector should be in a UHV chamber pumped by
a turbo molecular pump or an ion getter pump. A cold
trap at liquid nitrogen temperature may be useful to re-
duce the vapor pressure of condensable species, but its
use may not be necessary.

B. Cleaning the alkali content of the rhenium
ribbon

Following Goodfellow [15], rhenium ribbons contain 4
1014
ppm of potassium in mass corresponding to 3
potassium atoms per centimeter of ribbon length. At
high temperatures, these potassium atoms diﬀuse inside
the wire, reach its surface where they are emitted as ions.
Using the diﬀusion equation, we get the value of this ion
current, assuming an homogeneous initial potassium den-
sity and a wide ribbon (a

where N is the total number of potassium atoms in the
ribbon and q is the modulus of the electron charge. This
sum of exponential is characteristic of a diﬀusion pro-
cess, the diﬀusion mode of order p decaying with a time
constant τp = τ1/p2. For long times, the decay becomes
purely exponential, with the time constant τ1 related to

During the preparation of a ribbon made at a tempera-
ture T = 2250 K, the repeller plate (see ﬁgure 1) served to
collect about 38 % of the emitted ions. The correspond-
ing total ion current is plotted as a function of time in

time constant is long and as it scales like a2, it is very
important to choose a ribbon with a small thickness a,
to minimize the duration of the cleaning process.

×

After 6.5 hours of baking, we have brieﬂy varied the
wire temperature T and recorded the ion current as a
function of temperature. This current is proportional
to the diﬀusion constant, thus giving the temperature
dependence of the diﬀusion constant D, usually described
by an Arrhenius law:

Inﬂuence of rhenium oxidation on background

While measuring the detection probability as a func-
tion of surface temperature and oxygen pressure, we have
recorded the background signal. We discuss here only the
data corresponding for T = 1508 K, because the tem-
perature dependence is not very simple. With our best

the noise of this background signal is substantially larger
than Poisson noise (up to 5 times larger for 1 second
counting periods). These two eﬀects of a strong oxida-
tion (rapid increase of the background and excess noise)
decrease considerably the performance of the detector for
a small atomic ﬂux, even if oxidation gives an important
gain on detection probability.

D. Operating conditions and ultimate
performances

−

We have already explained the need for a high and
clean vacuum. If one operates near T = 1500 K, a small
oxygen residual pressure of the order of a few 10−9 mbar
is suﬃcient to reach a detection probability of the or-
der of 10
30 % and to keep the background at a very
low level. If the initial baking time has been suﬃciently
long, the potassium content of the rhenium ribbon may
be suﬃciently reduced to give a small background signal,
as long as the working temperature is not too high. In
Bielefeld, where a very large set of experiments have been
done [20, 21], and because the background pressure, pro-
10−8 mbar, the
duced by an ion getter pump, is below 1
typical background count rate is 100 counts per second.
In Toulouse, where we have less experience and a less
10−8 mbar produced by a turbo
good vacuum (near 3

pump), the typical background count rate is 1
counts per second.

Finally, in a high vacuum, surface contamination of
the rhenium ribbon by cracking of organic molecules is
very slow, but it is nevertheless necessary to clean the
ribbon surface from time to time by ﬂashing it to a high
temperature (typically 2250 K) for a few minutes, to get
a reproducible operation.

V. TIME RESPONSE OF THE DETECTOR:
RESIDENCE TIME OF LITHIUM ON A
RHENIUM SURFACE

The time response of a detector is very important for
many applications. The dominant contribution for the
present detector is the ion residence time on the surface,
usually in the microsecond to millisecond range. The
simplest measurement technique uses a chopped atomic
beam [12]. Another method, based on the autocorrela-
tion function of the ion current [22], has also been be used
and this method extends the measurement range down
to the microsecond range, a value diﬃcult to achieve by
chopping atomic beams. All the data sets present in
the literature have been ﬁtted by equation (2) namely
τ = τ0 exp (Eads/kBT ).

Using a chopped atomic beam, we collected two mea-
surements, extending slightly the ranges covered by these
works [12, 22]. Table 1 presents a comparison of our mea-
surements to the values deduced from ﬁtted laws given
in these two papers. The agreement between these re-
sults is rather poor and this is easily understood for the
following reasons:

•

•

temperature measurement may be aﬀected by sys-
tematic errors (see appendix A) and any error on
the temperature has a large eﬀect, because the res-
idence time τ varies very rapidly with temperature

in the simplest theoretical model (for example see
ref. [24]), the adsorption energy increases with the
work function Φ and the work function depends
on the degree of oxidation of the rhenium surface.
As diﬀerent experiments test rhenium surfaces with

6

diﬀerent degrees of oxidation, the diﬀerent values of
the residence time for the same temperature may
be a real eﬀect.

Table 2 collects the information concerning the resi-
dence time of all the alkali on rhenium, so as to illustrate
the trends followed by τ0 and Eads through this chemi-
cal family. τ0 is expected to be close to the vibrational
period of the ion near the surface and this property, well
veriﬁed in several cases, is not veriﬁed by the data con-

plains the scatter on τ0 with a correlated modiﬁcation of
the adsorption energy (as an example, the very diﬀerent
parameters of ref.
[12] and [22] for lithium lead to the
same value the residence time at T = 1600 K). The ad-
sorption energy may also vary with surface oxidation, as
discussed above, but this eﬀect cannot explain the very
large diﬀerences appearing in the case of lithium .

VI. MODELING OF THE SURFACE
IONIZATION PROCESS

Surface ionization of a species A is usually described
using the Saha-Langmuir equation (1). This implicitly
assumes a thermal equilibrium between the desorbing
particle and the surface and is thus independent of the
characteristics of the electron transfer process between A
and the surface. As will be shown below, it reproduces
rather well the experimental observations. However, one
can wonder about the corresponding microscopic view of
the process and possible dynamical eﬀects. The charge
transfer between an atomic projectile and a free-electron
metal surface is rather well understood [26] and quan-
titative descriptions are available (see e.g.
[27] for the
alkali case). We can use this microscopic description to
predict the surface ionization eﬃciency and compare it
to the Saha-Langmuir prediction.

As an alkali atom approaches a metal surface, its elec-
tronic levels couple with the continuum of metal states,

resulting in a ﬁnite lifetime of the atomic levels. The
corresponding width Γ gives the charge transfer rate be-
tween the atom and the surface. At T = 0 K, the electron
is transferred from the atom to the surface if the atomic
level is above the surface Fermi level and in the opposite
direction if the atomic level is below the Fermi level. For
a ﬁnite temperature T , electron transfer occurs in both
directions according to the fractional population of the
metallic states at the atomic level energy position [26].
For a free-electron metal, the width of the alkali level
varies approximately exponentially with the distance z
to the surface [27]. Qualitatively, when an alkali leaves
the surface, the very large width at small z allows the al-
kali charge state to reach thermal equilibrium; however,
this is not true at large z and there exists a distance,
called freezing distance, zF , beyond which the charge
state of the desorbing alkali decouples from the surface
[28]. Since the alkali level energy is a function Ea(z)
(for the ionic state, it roughly follows an image potential
variation [27]), the charge state equilibrium value changes
with z and the asymptotic charge state of the desorbed
particle is diﬀerent from its value on the surface and it a
priori depends on the desorption velocity. This ’freezing
distance’ discussion provides a qualitative picture of the
charge transfer between a projectile and a metal surface.
Quantitatively, if we assume that the desorbing parti-
cle follows a classical trajectory z(t), the evolution of its
charge state is governed by a rate equation [26]:

dn+
dt

=

2Γf (Ea(t), T )n+(t)

+Γ (1

n+(t)) (1

f (Ea(t), T ))

(7)

−

where n+(t) is the ion charge fraction, f (Ea(t), T ) the
Fermi function and Ea(t) designates Ea(z(t)).

Surface ionization is modeled by solving equation (7)
for a set of diﬀerent classical trajectories, representing
the diﬀerent possibilities for a desorbing alkali. The en-
ergies and widths in (7) are taken from the parameter-
free description of the alkali free-electron metal surface
study of ref. [27]. The initial state (z = zini) close to the
surface is taken ionic (n+ = 1) and equation (7) yields
the survival probability of the ion at a large distance for
each trajectory and we then have to sum the contribu-
tions from the diﬀerent trajectories. In practice, we solve
equation (7) up to a large z distance for a set of total en-
ergies, E, of the desorbing particle in the ionic channel.
The z(t) trajectory introduced in equation (7) is com-
mon to the ionic and neutral desorption channels, which
is not appropriate for large z. To circumvent this prob-
lem in the summation over the heavy particle energies,
E, we assume that the charge state stabilizes around the
freezing distance zF where we compare the local kinetic
energy of the desorbing particle to the energy required
for desorption in the ionic or neutral channel in order to
decide whether desorption is energetically allowed or not.
Ionic and neutral potential energy curves being diﬀerent,
this leads to a lower desorption threshold for neutral des-

We thus get the surface ionization probability for a
given surface work function and temperature. Such an
approach is indeed valid for a free-electron metal and
should also be meaningful in the case of low adsorbate
coverage of a metal. In the case of a low adsorbate cover-
age on the surface, the perturbation of the charge transfer
is usually described in terms of local and non-local eﬀects
(see a review on the adsorbate eﬀects in [31]). The local
eﬀect is due to the local potential around the adsorbate
which can strongly perturb the electron transfer in a cer-
tain region surrounding the adsorbate. The non-local
eﬀect comes from the surface work function change in-
duced by the adsorbate. An approach like the present
one only considers the non-local aspects. Local aspects
are mostly visible in scattering experiments which select
speciﬁc trajectories, thus probing speciﬁc areas on the
surface. Surface ionization a priori concerns the entire
surface and thus should average over the local eﬀects. For
very large adsorbate coverages, the electronic structure
of the surface is modiﬁed, possibly leading to an insu-
lator layer on the surface, on which the charge transfer
properties are diﬀerent (see e.g. a review in [29]).

×

We are going to describe surface ionization of lithium
on a rhenium surface as a function of the temperature T
and of the residual pressure, within the above approach
and we will use the rhenium work function extracted by
Kawano et al.
[11] from their electron emission experi-
ment (either directly the published data or the modeling
of these results presented here in Appendix B). Figure 5
presents the calculated surface ionization probability of
10−7 Torr, com-
lithium for a residual air pressure of 2.0
pared to the experimental results of Kawano et al.
[7].
The present microscopic results, obtained with the sur-
face work function modeling, are seen to reproduce the
experimental trends rather well, the abrupt change of the
ionization probability from 100% down to a few % as the
temperature is increased clearly appears to be connected
with the change of surface work function or equivalently
to the degree of oxidation of the rhenium surface. The
two limits (high and low T ) in the present case corre-
spond to either an almost clean rhenium surface and an
oxidized rhenium surface. The temperature Tc at which
the abrupt change occurs depends on the residual gas
pressure which directly inﬂuences the oxygen adsorption
change with temperature. Tc decreases when the residual
pressure decreases. Typically, it changes by around 300

8

×

K for a residual air pressure change between 10−9 and
10−6 Torr. The experimental and theoretical vari-
2
ations of the ionization probability are shifted one with
respect to the other by around 40 K. This can be due
to the approximations involved in the present modeling
and/or to the accuracy of the temperature scale (see be-
low and Appendix A). Finally, the asymptotic value of
the ionisation probabibility at high temperature is under-
estimated by our calculation and this proves that we use
a too low value of the work function Φ0 of clean unoxi-
dized rhenium. Clearly, this value, Φ0 = 4.94 eV, taken
[11] data ( see Appendix
from our ﬁt of Kawano et al.
B), is slightly lower than, for instance, the value obtained
by Persky [6], Φ0 = 5.0

0.1 eV.

pearing from the result. One can notice that the freez-
ing distance approximation (9) consists in applying the
Saha-Langmuir law expression for the electronic levels
alone at the point where the electronic levels decouple;
the sum over the heavy particle energies (equation (8)),
which takes into account the energy changes between zF
and inﬁnity, transforms it into the usual Saha-Langmuir
expression for the total energy of the system evaluated at
inﬁnity. The good agreement between the present micro-
scopic model and Saha-Langmuir expression thus proves
that dynamical eﬀects are absent and that the speciﬁcity
of the metal surface-projectile charge transfer process dis-
appears. This comforts the validity of a thermal equilib-
rium approach for the surface ionization process.

the present modeling and the experimental results of

The predictions of the present microscopic study are ex-

Figure 6 presents a comparison of experimental and
theoretical results for the surface ionization probability
10−6 Torr. Two theoret-
for a residual air pressure of 2.0
ical results are presented which were obtained either by
using directly the surface work function extracted from
electron emission experiments [11] or by using its mod-
eling (Appendix B). The two results are close one to the
other, conﬁrming the eﬃciency of the modeling of the
work function change. The two experimental sets are the
results from reference [7] and the present results. The
latter have been multiplied by 1.41 = 1/E+ to transform
our detection probability result D+ into an ionization
probability P+. Although the general behaviour of P+
as a function of T is the same in the three sets, they ap-
pear shifted one with respect to the other. The abrupt

change in P+ as a function of T from ref. [7] is more rapid
than in the present study. In both cases, there is an up-
ward temperature shift when going from the model to the
experiments (about 70 K for the data of ref. [7] and 110
K for our results). These diﬀerences are tentatively at-
tributed to the accuracy of the temperature scales, both
in the experimental results on surface ionization (esti-
mated to 5 % in the present study) and in the modeling
via the use of the electron emission experimental results
[11].

long as one does not want to describe the temperature

other ribbon geometries, this factor is easily scaled, using
equation (10). All temperatures appearing in this paper
were deduced from this equation (even up to 2250 K),
without recalling our estimated 5% error bar.

We have also used an optical pyrometer to measure
the temperature: the sensitivity is close
5 Kelvin, but
we have no way to test its calibration. Moreover, such
pyrometers are calibrated to measure the temperature of
a blackbody radiation and the readings Tr must be cor-
rected to take into account rhenium spectral emittance

Appendix B: Rhenium work function Φ as a function
of oxidation and temperature

In 1999, Kawano et al.

The strong inﬂuence of oxidation of rhenium surface on
the ionization probability of lithium was ﬁrst observed by
Persky [6] in 1968. This study was continued by Kawano
and coworkers [7, 9, 10], who used the Saha-Langmuir
law to deduce the work function from the observed ion-
ization probability.
[11] also
measured the work function of oxidized rhenium from
the emitted electron current, using the Richardson law
( J = AT 2 exp (
Φ/kBT )) to relate the current density
J to the work function Φ. The two values of the work
function diﬀer noticeably, the work function for positive
ion emission deduced from the Saha-Langmuir law being
substantially larger than the work function for electron
emission deduced from the Richardson law.

−

We ﬁrst discuss the work function for electron emis-
sion because Kawano and coworkers [11] have collected a
large data set as a function of oxygen pressure and rhe-
nium temperature. We have developed a simple model
which ﬁts these results very satisfactorily. The oxygen
surface coverage is assumed to be described by the fol-
lowing chemical equilibrium:

2 rhenium sites + O2 ⇀↽ 2 oxidized rhenium sites (15)

Let σRe and σReO be the density of unoxidized and ox-
idized sites respectively, and p(O2) the partial pressure
of molecular oxygen. The equation resulting from this
chemical equilibrium is:

σReO
σRe (cid:19)

(cid:18)

2

=

p(O2)
pc(T )

(16)

where pc(T ) is the equilibrium constant of the reaction,
written so as to have the dimension of a pressure. From
this equation, we can deduce the fraction f of the oxi-
dized sites:

f =

σReO
σRe + σReO

=

p(O2)/pc(T )

p
1 +

p(O2)/pc(T )

We would get a diﬀerent equation if we consider that
each rhenium site accepts two oxygen atoms. We have
also tried to ﬁt the data with this modiﬁed equation. As
the resulting ﬁt is considerably less good, we consider
that this second hypothesis is not correct. The second
assumption of the model is that the work function Φ
increases linearly with the coverage f from the pure metal
value Φ0 to the completely oxidized value noted Φ0 + ∆:

Φ = Φ0 + f ∆

[11] in the temperature range 1400

This assumption is surely oversimpliﬁed but we do not
see how to reﬁne easily this model as it already repre-
sents quite well the results presented of H. Kawano et
al.
2000 K. Our
ﬁt to these results is presented in ﬁgure 7. Below 1400
K, the observed variations of the work function deviate
strongly from the trend observed at higher temperatures
and we have not tried to ﬁt this data. From the ﬁts, we
extract the following values: Φ0 = 4.94 eV, ∆ = 1.125
eV and for each temperature a value of the equilibrium
constant pc(T ). The data of ﬁgure 5 of reference [11]
are well ﬁtted too, but with a slightly lower ∆ value,
∆ = 1.00 eV. From these ﬁts, we have deduced 8 values
of pc(T ). A good test of the consistency of our model is

10

that, as expected from thermodynamics, these values are
well represented by the following formula:

log10(pc(T )) = A +

−

If the pressures are expressed in Torr, we get A = 9.186
25072 K. The quantity B corresponds to an
and B =
−
energy B =
2.16 eV, which represents the energy diﬀer-
ence between the two sides of the chemical equilibrium
described by equation (15). This modeling provides a
very eﬃcient way of interpolating between the measured
work function values and we used it in our treatment of
the surface ionization to deﬁne the surface work function
as a function of the operating conditions.

The work function of rhenium can also be deduced
from the measurements of the ionization probability of
sodium or lithium [7, 9, 10]. The analysis is somewhat
more complex because the experiments were done with
intense alkali halide beams and the dissociation equilib-
rium of the molecule on the surface must be taken into
account. The Saha-Langmuir law is used to extract the
work function Φ+ (thus noted as it diﬀers from the elec-
tron emission value) from the data as a function of the
surface temperature and oxygen pressure. However, two
aspects of the analysis of Kawano and coworkers deserve
further discussion:

•

•

the ionization potential I of the alkali atom is taken
as a function of the wire temperature (this function
appears to be I(T ) = I0 + 2.5kBT ). This is a sub-
stantial eﬀect which is not commonly considered
(see for instance ref.
[13], in which very accurate
measurements of the platinum and iridium work
function are made as a function of the tempera-
ture). Adding this unusual T dependence to the
atomic ionization energy signiﬁcantly contributes
to the observed diﬀerence between the surface work
function extracted from electron emission and the
eﬀective work function extracted from surface ion-
ization data.

it is surely very diﬃcult to estimate the ionization
probability to better than a few percent, in partic-
ular because the ﬂux incident on the wire is calcu-
lated from vapor pressure data which are not very
accurate (as discussed in the present paper in the
lithium case). It is therefore very diﬃcult to under-
stand how the work function Φ+ can reach a value
as large as 6.7 eV (see ﬁgure 3b of ref.
[9] where
the experiment was done with NaCl): as soon as
5.3kBT , the Saha-Langmuir law pre-
(Φ+ −
≥
0.99, almost impossible to distinguish
dicts P+ ≥
experimentally from P+ = 1. For temperatures
close to 1500 K, the maximum value of Φ+, which
can be reliably deduced from Saha-Langmuir law, is
not larger than 6.1 eV when working with lithium
(and only 5.8 eV when working with sodium for
which I = 5.139 eV).

I)

•

ﬁnally, one can stress that most of the experimen-
tal results of ref. [7] and [9] on the surface ioniza-
tion probability of lithium and sodium can be re-
produced by Saha-Langmuir law using the surface
work function extracted from electron emission [11]
and the ionization potential of the free atom. There
does not seem to be any need to introduce an ef-
fective work function for surface ionization, which

could be, at best, only a parameterization of the
experimental results.

Therefore, we think that the experimental results on
P+, obtained by Kawano and co-workers are very inter-
esting for the characterisation of a surface ionization de-
tector, but the values of Φ+ extracted from these should
be considered with caution.

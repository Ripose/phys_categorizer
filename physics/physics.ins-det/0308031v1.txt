Abstract

Spatial distribution of intensity, degree and direction of linear polarization of
tagged photon beam, which is obtained due to Compton backscattering of laser
light on high-energy electron beam, are calculated. Eﬀects of angular dispersion
and spatial spread of electron beam are taken into account. Calculations have been
carried out for the example of LEGS facility.

Method of obtaining monochromatic and polarized photon beams of high energy and
intensity by the Compton backscattering of laser photon on high-energy electron beam
is widely used in many active and planned facilities. The most attractive feature of
such photon beams is the circumstance that obtained beam completely inherits polarizing
characteristics of an initial laser beam in a vicinity of the top edge of a spectrum (Compton
edge), and these characteristics can be controlled well in this region. But in process of
deviation from Compton edge of spectrum the polarization of outgoing photons decreases
and shape of spatial distribution of intensity and polarization becomes rather complicated.
The photon beam could be eﬀectively split on two ones, linear polarization in the center
of photon spot is less than at its periphery. This moment is important for the analysis
of experimental results, but it is usually discussed at a level of scientiﬁc folklore, and the
purpose of the present note is - to discuss this eﬀects in more details.
Let’s consider kinematics of the Compton scattering process

γ(k1) + e−(p1)

γ(k2) + e−(p2)

→
in the laboratory frame where axis z coincides with a beam’s axis and x axis belongs to
horizontal plane of accelerator’s beam. From 4–momentum conservation law k1 + p1 =
k2 + p2 it follows

where

αx = θ1 cos ϕ1, αy = θ1 sin ϕ1 are plane angles in x and y directions of initial electron
(θ1, ϕ1 are its polar and azimuthal angles), θx = θ2 cos ϕ2, θy = θ2 sin ϕ2 are plane angles
in x and y directions of ﬁnal photon (θ2, ϕ2 are its polar and azimuthal angles).

Thus we can see from (1) that photons with a deﬁnite energy ω2 are emitted at the surface
of the circle cone with an axis along direction of initial electron motion and the opening
angle r. Allowable energy of outgoing photon is determined from a condition of positive
deﬁniteness of r2, and maximal possible energy of secondary photon is

Let us consider what spatial distribution of tagged photons with deﬁned energy we
shall obtain at the plane of target situated at distance L from Compton interaction region.
We shall suppose that (due to the large value of L in comparison with longitudinal size of
laser and electron beams crossing region) the Compton interaction points are distributed
at one plane according to Gaussian low with dispersions δx and δy. The plane angles θ1x,
θ1y of electrons relatively to beam axes also have Gaussian distribution with dispersion
σx and σy. So, spatial - angular density of probability of initial electron states is:

There is one-to-one correspondence between variables (ω2, ϕ) and point (x, y) of
photon arriving at the target if set of variables (x1, y1, θ1x, θ1y), which describe state of
initial electron, are ﬁxed:

p

x = x1 + L (θ1x + r cos ϕ) ;

y = y1 + L (θ1y + r sin ϕ) ;

(13)

The tagging system allows to select events with deﬁned photon energy, ω2. To take
into account inﬂuence of tagging system, we have to integrate diﬀerential cross section
(4) over photon energy with some appropriate distribution which describes this system.
Since accuracy of modern tagging systems is rather high, near (1 - 2)%, we can use as
such distribution a δ
function. Then distribution at the target plane of arrival points

At the ﬁgures (1 - 13) results of calculations on the base of formulae (16 - 18) are
depicted. This calculations have been carried out for example of LEGS facility. In this
case energy of electron beam ε1 = 2580 MeV, UV laser photons have energy ω1 = 3.7 eV,
so λ = 4ε1ω1 = 0.146 and upper limit of backscattered photons’ energy is ω2max = 330
MeV. Dispersion of electron beam in horizontal direction is σx = 240 µrad, and in vertical
direction – σy = 80 µrad. Dispersion of
distribution of Compton interaction
{
points is δx = δy = 0.1 cm.The distance from Compton interaction region to the target
is L = 45 m.
It is supposed that laser photon beam has 100% linear polarization in
horizontal plane (ξ1

3 = +1) or in vertical plane (ξ1

x1, y1}

the case when laser photons are polarized in vertical plane (ξ1
!). One can see that

polarization of ﬁnal photons is near 98.9% for this energy but in the ﬁrst case polarization
in the center of photon beam spot is slightly less.

The essentially other situation arises when photon energy decreases below 280 MeV.
Then in the case of horizontal polarization of laser (ξ1
3 = +1) secondary photon beam
is split into two ones and degree of polarization has deep minimum at line y = 0. (See
ﬁgures 4 - 5).

After change of laser polarization direction this splitting of secondary beam disap-
peared and distribution of polarization degree has a saddle shape. (See ﬁgures 6 - 7).
Let’s note that these eﬀects have been observed and reported in [6].

At the ﬁgures (8 - 9) such summarized distribution of intensity and degree of linear
polarization for the case of horizontal polarization of laser photons is shown. At the ﬁgures
(10 - 11) analogous distribution for the case of vertical polarization of laser photons are
shown.

At last, at the ﬁgures (12 - 13) the averaged over interval of photon energies 220

linear polarization of ﬁnal photons φ(x, y) are shown for the cases of horizontal (ﬁg. 12)
and vertical (ﬁg.13) polarization of initial laser photons.

From these ﬁgures one can see that φ(x, y) = 0 at the lines x = 0 and y = 0, but at
periphery of photon spot it can reach 5◦ relatively to direction of initial laser polarization
in the case of horizontal and 10◦ in the case of vertical polarization of laser.

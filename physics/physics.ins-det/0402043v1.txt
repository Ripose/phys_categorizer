Abstract

Using prototype modules of the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector we investi-
gate space charge eﬀects and the dependence of the pion rejection performance on
the incident angle of the ionizing particle. The average pulse height distributions in
the drift chambers operated with the Xe,CO2(15%) mixture provide quantitative
information on the gas gain reduction due to space charge accumulating during
the drift of the primary ionization. Our results demonstrate that the pion rejection
performance of a TRD is better for tracks which are not at normal incidence to the
anode wires. We present detailed simulations of detector signals, which reproduce
the measurements and lend strong support to our interpretation of the measure-
ments in terms of space charge eﬀects.

radiation detector, electron/pion identiﬁcation

1 Introduction

The ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) [1] is designed to provide electron iden-
tiﬁcation and particle tracking in the high-multiplicity environment of Pb+Pb collisions
at the LHC. To achieve the challenging goals of the detector, accurate pulse height mea-
surement in the drift chambers operated with a Xe,CO2(15%) gas mixture over the full
drift time of the order of 2 µs is a necessary requirement. For such precision measure-
ments, it is of particular importance ﬁrst to collect [2], and then to properly amplify all
the charge created in the detector. For electrons, the transition radiation, superimposed
on the ionization charge, provides the required electron/pion identiﬁcation capability.

For any detector with gas ampliﬁcation, the positive ions created in the avalanche move
slowly away from the anode, and this space charge leads to a local reduction of the
electric ﬁeld in the proximity of the anode. The eﬀect was recognized in the early days
of the development of proportional counters and was studied quantitatively later on [3,4].
In case of multi-wire proportional drift chambers, the space charge was also studied in
detail [5,6,7,8], as was, more recently, done for electromagnetic calorimeters [9]. Several
theoretical treatments of the problem have been published [3,10,11]. All of the previous
studies concentrated on the resulting gain drop of the detector, with its associated loss of
eﬃciency [5], as a function of the rate of incoming radiation. Recently, the eﬀect of space
charge on the position resolution of drift tubes was also investigated [12,13].

The most obvious impediment caused by space charge concerns the high-rate performance
of drift chambers (and gaseous detectors in general). However, space charge can also
inﬂuence the signal amplitude within a single track [5,8,14]. For usual ﬁeld values applied
in multi-wire drift chambers, it takes several µs for the positive ions to move away from
the anode surface to a distance of several tens of the wire radius [15], where their eﬀect
on the anode ﬁeld may be considered negligible. Since in usual drift chambers the arrival
time of the primary electrons is also of the order of microseconds, the signal will be
aﬀected by the space charge created by the ampliﬁcation of primary electrons over the
full signal collection time (track length). As noted earlier [5], the eﬀect is most pronounced
for tracks at normal incidence to the anode wires, for which all charge collection takes
place in a very conﬁned region on the anode wire. The dimension of an avalanche created
by one electron is below 100 µm, essentially independent of its total charge [16]. The most
signiﬁcant contribution to the extension of the avalanche for a cluster of electrons is in

440 µm FWHM for 1 cm drift in our detectors.

We report on measurements of space charge eﬀects within a single track in drift chambers
operated with the Xe,CO2(15%) gas mixture. The measurements were performed during
prototype tests for the ALICE TRD. The experimental setup and method of data analysis
are described in the next section. We then present our measurements of the average pulse
height dependence on drift time as a function of incident angle and gas gain. The impli-
cations of space charge on electron/pion identiﬁcation are discussed. The measurements
are compared to simulations, which strongly support our interpretation of the results in
terms of space charge eﬀects.

2 Experimental setup

×

The results are obtained using prototype drift chambers (DC) with a construction sim-
ilar to that anticipated for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD [1], but with a smaller active area
32 cm2). In Fig. 2 we present a schematic view of the DC. As the ﬁnal detectors
(25
for ALICE TRD [1], our prototypes have a drift region of 30 mm and an ampliﬁcation
region of 7 mm. Anode wires (W-Au) of 20 µm diameter are used, with a pitch of 5 mm.
The cathode wires (Cu-Be) have 75 µm diameter and a pitch of 2.5 mm, in a staggered
geometry. We read out the signal on a segmented cathode plane with rectangular pads of
8 cm length and 0.75 cm width (along the direction of the wires). The entrance window
(25 µm aluminized Kapton) simultaneously serves as gas barrier and as drift electrode.
We operate the drift chambers with the standard gas mixture for the TRD, Xe,CO2(15%),
at atmospheric pressure. The gas is recirculated using a dedicated gas system.

We use a prototype of the charge-sensitive preampliﬁer/shaper (PASA) especially designed
and built for the TRD in AMS 0.35 µm CMOS technology. It has a noise on-detector of
about 1000 electrons r.m.s. for our cathode pad capacitance of about 20 pF (including a
3 pF contribution of the connection cable). The FWHM of the slightly asymmetric output
pulse is about 100 ns for an input step function. In Fig. 1 we show an averaged PASA signal
for 55Fe source X-rays of 5.9 keV. The signal induced on the pads is determined mainly by
the ions moving slowly away from the anode, leading to a wider signal compared to the
intrinsic PASA shaping and to long tails. The contribution of the longitudinal diﬀusion
to the signal width is about 50 ns FWHM. This convolution of detector signal and PASA
response is the so-called time response function, TRF. Here and in the following, the time
zero is arbitrarily shifted by about 0.3 µs to facilitate a simultaneous measurement of the
baseline and of noise. The nominal gain of the PASA is 12 mV/fC, but during the present
measurements we lowered the gain to 6 mV/fC for a better match to the range of our Flash
ADC (FADC) system with 0.6 V voltage swing. The FADC used for the tests is diﬀerent
from the one designed for the ﬁnal detector [1]. It has an 8-bit non-linear conversion and
adjustable baseline, running at 20 MHz sampling frequency. The data acquisition (DAQ)
is based on a VME event builder and was developed at GSI [17]. As the beam diameter is

radiator used for these measurements is of the same design as the one envisaged for the
ﬁnal ALICE TRD [1]. It is a sandwich of Rohacell foam and polypropylene ﬁbres. A
reinforcement of carbon ﬁbres of about 100 µm thickness is applied to the outer surfaces
of this sandwich to ensure for the real-size detectors the ﬂatness of the drift electrode,
which will be directly glued on the radiator, for overpressures up to 1 mbar.

To study the eﬀect of space charge on the time evolution of the average signal, we vary the
angle of incidence of the beam with respect to the normal incidence to the anode wires.
A particle trajectory through the detector is sketched in Fig. 2. The measurements were
carried out at the T10 secondary beamline of the CERN PS [18] at the beam momentum
of 3 GeV/c. The resolution of the beam momentum is ∆p/p
1%. The beam intensity
was up to 3000 particles per spill of about half a second. The beam contains a mixture of
electrons and negative pions, with an electron content of about 2%. Similar sample sizes
of pion and electron events were acquired under exactly the same detector conditions,
via dedicated triggers. For the present analysis we have selected clean samples of pions
and electrons using coincident thresholds on two Cherenkov detectors and on a lead-glass
calorimeter [19].

3 Experimental results

We performed the measurements for four values of gas gain, 2400, 3900, 6200 and 9600,
corresponding to anode voltages of 1.5, 1.55, 1.6 and 1.65 kV. The drift ﬁeld for the
nominal drift voltage of -2.1 kV varies from 725 to 733 V/cm for our range of the anode
voltages. The incident angle with respect to the normal to the pad plane was varied
from 0◦ to 15◦ in steps of 5◦ by tilting the detectors with respect to the direction of the
beam about an axis perpendicular to the wires (see Fig. 2) and perpendicular to the drift
direction.

In Fig. 3 we present the dependence of the average pulse height,
for diﬀerent incident angles α, for pions and electrons. These average signals were recorded
for the anode voltage of 1.55 kV. They are the sum of all eight pads and consequently
are not inﬂuenced by the charge sharing between adjacent pads, which depends on the
angle of incidence. The overlap of the long ion tails (TRF) results, in case of pions, in
a slightly rising average pulse height as a function of the drift time, as seen in Fig. 3
for large angles. The peak at short drift times originates from the primary ionization
(dE/dx) generated in the ampliﬁcation region, where the signal from both sides of the
anode wires overlaps in the same time interval. Due to the stronger ﬁeld, the drift velocity
in the ampliﬁcation region is considerably larger than in the drift region. Consequently,
the timing characteristics of the signal from the ampliﬁcation region is determined mainly
by the shaping time of the PASA. As the angle decreases towards normal incidence, the
signal is progressively attenuated as a function of drift time, a clear indication of the
eﬀect of space charge. As this is a local eﬀect, when spreading the primary electrons along

the anode wire, the eﬀect becomes less important, at least for our moderate values of
the gain. Note that the amplitude of the signal in the ampliﬁcation region is independent
of the angle, since there are no previous avalanches that can screen it. Only a trivial
normalization of the data for diﬀerent angles is done to take into account the variation
of the eﬀective track length with the angle. We note that our measurements established
for the ﬁrst time [19,2] the expected time evolution of the signal in this type of drift
chambers. It is possible that earlier measurements [20,21,14], showing a decreasing value
of the average signal in the drift region, suﬀered from space charge eﬀects within a single
track, due to the normal incidence used. For electrons, the contribution of transition
radiation (TR), which is absorbed preferentially at the entrance of the drift chamber and
is registered superposed on dE/dx, results in the strong rise of the average signal towards
the end of the drift time. The dE/dx of electrons is in the regime of the Fermi plateau
and consequently is on average about 40% larger than for pions at 3 GeV/c [22].

charges in the ampliﬁcation region, Qa, and in the last quarter of the drift region, Q4.
These charges are plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of the anode voltage for all the incident
angles, for pions and electrons. These dependences reﬂect the exponential gas gain increase
as a function of the anode voltage, represented by the lines. In the presence of space charge
the measured charges would ﬂatten for higher anode voltages [15], in particular at normal
incidence, when the charge is collected in a narrow spot on the anode wire. An exponential
behavior is seen for Qa for all angles, demonstrating that no space charge eﬀects due to
rate occur for our voltage values. Taking into account our beam conditions (3000 particles
in half a second, spread uniformly in a disk of 3 cm diameter) results in a rate of about
50 Hz per mm of anode wire. This is a very low local rate, compared to the value of
106 Hz/mm, estimated from the X-rays measurements of ref. [7] to be the onset of rate-
induced space charge eﬀects for a gas gain of about 4000. The fact that only Q4 shows a
ﬂatter dependence on anode voltage for the normal incidence can only be caused by the
space charge produced by the avalanches of the earlier ionization electrons of the same
track. Larger dE/dx and the contribution of TR makes the eﬀect larger for electrons.

Fig. 5. Ratios of charges recorded in the drift and ampliﬁcation region as a function of incident
angle for four values of the gas gain, for pions and electrons.

The ratio Q4/Qa is plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of the incident angle for four values
of the gas gain for pions and electrons. For pions, due to track segment considerations,
this ratio should be close to unity, but its absolute value is inﬂuenced by the integration
windows (through the ﬁnite time bin size) and by the TRF. For electrons, due to the
contribution of TR, the ratio has a larger value. In the absence of screening due to space
charge, for both pions and electrons this ratio would be independent of the incident angle,
but we observe a marked variation as a function of angle, in particular a sharp drop for
small angles. A saturation is reached at large angles due to the locality of the screening.
This behavior was observed before with an Ar-based mixture [5], albeit with a diﬀerent
magnitude, due probably to the much larger gas gain used in that study. More recently,
similar results were obtained for a He-based mixture [8]. As expected from space charge
considerations, we observe a stronger variation of the ratio for larger gains, in qualitative
agreement with other observations [8].

Fig. 6. Ratio of signal of electrons and pions as a function of drift time for four values of the gas
gain. Left panel is for 15◦ incidence, right panel is for 0◦ incidence.

In Fig. 6 we present the ratio of the average signal of electrons to pions, Re/π, as a
function of drift time, for two extreme cases of incidence, 15◦ and 0◦ and for four values
of the gas gain. The time dependence of Re/π is due to the contribution of TR. This
ratio is independent of the gas gain for the angle of 15◦, when space charge plays no
role. Conversely, at normal incidence, when space charge is most important, a progressive
reduction of Re/π is seen as a function of gas gain. The ratio Re/π is a direct measure of
the electron/pion separation power of a TRD.

The observed stronger attenuation of the signal due to space charge for electrons compared
to pions does aﬀect the electron/pion identiﬁcation performance of a TRD. For our case,
we calculate the pion eﬃciency for 90% electron eﬃciency using a likelihood method [23]
on the total energy deposited in a single chamber. Again, to improve statistics, each of the
four layers has been treated as a separate detector and its total charge ﬁlled in a common
histogram, for pions and electrons separately. We use these two charge distributions in a
simulation program to calculate the likelihood (to be an electron) for a six layer detector,
corresponding to the conﬁguration of ALICE TRD. A 90% eﬃciency cut has been selected
in the likelihood distribution of electrons and the pion contamination has been calculated.
The results are presented in Fig. 7 as a function of incident angle for our four values
of the gas gain. A pion rejection factor (inverse of the pion eﬃciency) of about 100 is
achieved for ﬁnite angles of incidence, fulﬁlling the ALICE design goal [1]. One can see the
expected degradation of the pion rejection power as the incident angle approaches normal
incidence. Besides the space charge, two other contributions have to be recognized: i) the

improvement of pion rejection for larger gains due to larger values of the signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N); ii) the improvement of pion rejection as a function of angle arising from a
thicker eﬀective radiator and detector. To quantify this last eﬀect, we calculate the angle
dependence of the pion eﬃciency using simulated events. A parametrization for a regular
radiator was tuned to reproduce the measured pion eﬃciencies at 15◦. Space charge eﬀects
are not included in the simulations, which are performed at a constant S/N. The results
are represented by the dotted line and the shaded area in Fig. 7. Although the statistical
errors of the measurements are rather large, an obvious degradation of the pion rejection
is observed for normal incidence. For the upper values of our gas gain we measure at
0◦ a pion rejection worse by a factor of 1.5 beyond the expected contribution due to the
eﬀective thicknesses. A similar degradation for normal incidence was observed, albeit with
a much greater magnitude, in electron/pion identiﬁcation using dE/dx measurements with
prototypes for the PHENIX experiment and was also attributed to space charge [24].

Since our FADC measurements make available the time dependence of the avalanche
charge for each individual track, it is conceivable that the space charge eﬀects can be
corrected using this information. We have implemented such a procedure, in which the
measured amplitude of a given time bin is corrected by a factor which depends on the

10

p
total charge registered prior to this time bin. The correction is done event-by-event, in an
identical (”blind”) way for both pions and electrons and is tuned to restore the average
ratio RhP Hi (see Fig. 10) to a ﬂat dependence on the drift time. This correction is successful
in restoring the ratio Re/π (see Fig. 6) for 0◦ incidence to the value measured at 15◦.
However, the pion rejection factor is improved only marginally because the ﬂuctuations
of the charge distributions are ampliﬁed by the correction. For instance, the r.m.s. of the
pion charge distribution is 77% before and 87% after correction (compared to 71% at 15◦
incidence).

The degradation of the electron/pion identiﬁcation performance for tracks approaching
normal incidence to the anode wires is an important argument for operating detectors
at the lowest possible gas gain. Concerning the ALICE TRD, the optimal gas gain value
is a compromise between the requirements on pion rejection and on position resolution,
which is strongly improving as a function of S/N. We note that, due to the geometry of
the ALICE TRD, normal incidence occurs rather seldom. The features presented above
in case of electron/pion identiﬁcation with TRD apply also to the identiﬁcation of other
particle species using energy loss in ionization detectors. Lighter gas mixtures show the
eﬀect of space charge as well [8,25].

4 Comparison to simulations

For a quantitative understanding of the observations presented before we have performed
a Monte Carlo simulation of the detector signal. The underlying physical picture has been
described in [15] and will be brieﬂy summarized in the following.

The electric ﬁeld around the anode wire is assumed to correspond to an ideal cylindrical
geometry and is given by the charge density λ on the wire:

E0(r) =

λ
2πǫ0r

with λ = σV , where σ is the wire capacitance per unit length and V the anode voltage.
The ions produced in an avalanche form a cylinder of positive space-charge with radius
R and charge density λ⋆ surrounding the anode wire. The presence of the space-charge
cylinder leads to a modiﬁcation of the charge density on the wire. Inside the space-charge
cylinder the electric ﬁeld is

Ein(r) =

(r < R)

λ′

where λ′ is the modiﬁed charge density on the wire. Outside the space-charge cylinder the

particle trajectory in the detector gas. The arrival time at the anode wire has been calcu-
lated using GARFIELD. The arrival point along the wire is determined by the incident
angle of the simulated track and smeared by transverse diﬀusion.

The computation of the actual multiplication factor Gi of an electron i requires the con-
sideration of the ion clouds with charge density λ⋆

It is important to note that the contribution of an electron j in Eq. (11) and (12) is only
considered if the lateral distance of the arrival points at the wire of electrons i and j is
smaller than L/2. In this way, the dependence of the space charge eﬀect on the incident
angle is introduced. It is also required that the ions have drifted at least 50 µm away from
the wire to ensure that the ions are outside the ampliﬁcation region.

The number of primary electrons used in the simulations are the measured values. For
our momentum of 3 GeV/c, we measure [22] an average energy deposit for pions of 5.5
keV/cm, which amounts for our gas mixture to 243 primary electrons per cm. 170 electrons
from the ampliﬁcation region arrive at the anode in a fraction of a µs, while, from the drift
region, 729 electrons arrive at a constant rate over the drift time of 1.8 µs. For instance,
after gas ampliﬁcation this corresponds, for a gas gain of 3900, to a total charge of 106 fC
and 455 fC, respectively. For electrons we use the time-dependent ratio measured at 15◦

13

incidence (left panel of Fig. 6), which is independent of the gas gain. All the other input
values used in the calculations are summarized in Table 1.

Drift time (m s)

Fig. 8. Simulated relative gain as a function of drift time at normal incidence for three values of
the gas gain, for pions and electrons.

The calculated average relative gain values as a function of drift time are shown in Fig. 8
for pions and electrons at normal incidence, for three values of the gas gain. The sharp
drop of the gas gain in the ﬁrst 0.1 µs is due to the eﬀect of the large charge densities
from the energy deposit in the ampliﬁcation region. After this, the gain reduction due

14

to space charge approximately levels oﬀ in case of pions as a result of an equilibrium
between the incoming charge from the drift region at a roughly constant rate and the
movement of the ions from previous avalanches away from the anode. The gain reduction
for electrons is stronger than for pions and with a more pronounced time dependence.
As already explained, this is due to the larger average signals for electrons, in particular
with the contribution of TR at large drift times. For the largest value of the gas gain a
reduction of the signal at the end of the drift time by about 30% is observed for pions
and by about 40% for electrons.

For an exact description of the measured signals, the arrival time distribution of the
primary electrons is folded by the single-electron TRF, which has been determined ex-
perimentally from the signal shape of 55Fe events (see Fig. 1). The resulting simulated
signals are shown in Fig. 9 for tracks with diﬀerent incident angles. A very good overall
agreement with the measured signals is seen. As in case of the measurements, a clear
reduction of the pulse height for tracks with small incident angle can be observed as a

Drift time (m s)

Fig. 10. Ratios of signals at 0◦ and 15◦ incidence as a function of drift time for three values of
the gas gain, for pions and electrons. The measurements (symbols) are compared to calculations
(lines).

To quantify the signal reduction, we construct the ratio of the average signal at normal
incidence to the average signal at the largest incidence, RhP Hi. From the measured be-
haviour of charge ratios as a function of angle, seen in Fig. 5, one can conclude that the
screening is negligible for our largest angle of incidence. Indeed, our simulations show
that, for 15◦ incidence, the gain at the end of the drift is reduced by only 1.5%. As a
consequence, RhP Hi is a quantitative measure of the screening at normal incidence. In
Fig. 10 we present the dependence of this ratio on drift time for pions and electrons for
three values of the gas gain. The time reference has been chosen to be the time of the
0.5 µs in Figs. 3 and 9). The measurements are
maximum
compared to calculations. The ﬁne structure of the measured data is an artifact of signal
ﬂuctuations due to limited track statistics. Despite the simplifying assumptions involved,
the calculations are in a reasonable agreement with the measurements, in the magnitude
as well as in the shape.

5 Summary

We have reported measurements on space charge eﬀects within a single track and the
dependence of the pion rejection performance on the incident angle, carried out using
prototype detectors for the ALICE TRD. Our measurements of average pulse height
distributions in drift chambers operated with Xe,CO2(15%) provide quantitative results
on the signal reduction within a given track due to space charge accumulation during
the drift of the primary ionization. We have shown that the pion rejection performance
of a TRD is impaired for tracks at normal incidence to the anode wire plane. Since in
general normal incidence cannot be avoided in drift chambers, the only possibility to
minimize the space charge eﬀects is to chose the lowest possible gas gain allowed by a
reasonable compromise on the desired position resolution of the detector. Our detailed
simulations of the detector signals are in a remarkable agreement with the measurements,
hence demonstrating that space charge is the explanation for the observed signal reduction
within a signal track at normal incidence to the anode wires.

We acknowledge A. Radu and J. Hehner for the skills and dedication in building our
detectors and N. Kurz for help on data acquisition. We would also like to acknowledge P.
Szymanski for help in organizing the experiment and A. Przybyla and M. Wensveen for
technical assistance during the measurements.

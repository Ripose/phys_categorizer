Abstract

A numerical method of determining the wire sag in a multiwire proportional
chamber used in RICH [1] by solving the second order diﬀerential equation
which governs the wire stability has been presented. The three point Finite
Diﬀerence Method (FDM) has generated a tridiagonal matrix equation relating
the deﬂection of wire segments to the force acting on it. The precise estimates
of electrostatic force has been obtained from accurate ﬁeld computation using
a nearly exact Boundary Element Method (neBEM) solver [2].

Introduction

The dimension of the multiwire chambers deployed in modern high energy physics
experiments is usually large conforming to the scale of experimental setup. The
electrostatic instability in such chambers may be crucial when the amplitude of
the oscillation caused by the action of electrostatic force alone or combined with
the gravity becomes comparable to the electrode spacings. The study of the wire
deﬂection in such a geometry is usually a complex aﬀair since an interplay between
several physical forces determines the wire stability. The approximation of constant
or linear dependence of the force on the wire deﬂection is not adequate to solve for
the diﬀerential equation governing the wire dynamics because all the wires in the
chamber move in a collective way inﬂuencing each other giving rise to a nonlinear
eﬀect. Since the exact solutions for the diﬀerential equation involving the nonlinear
force are no longer known, it has to be solved numerically.

Of various methods of estimating the electrostatic sag from the diﬀerential equa-
tion, only the linear and iterative methods have been attempted in several geometries
[3, 4]. In these works, the electrostatic force has been estimated from the 2D ﬁeld
calculation [5] which diﬀers signiﬁcantly from 3D solutions. Owing to the 2D nature
of the problem, the sag is normally overestimated due to the fact that the whole

1

length of the wire is considered to be at maximum sag. In this work, an accurate 3d
computation of electrostatic ﬁeld has been carried out through the use of a nearly
exact Boundary Element Method (neBEM) [2] which has yielded precise force esti-
mation. In order to reduce complexity, only the normal component of the ﬁeld has
been considered in the calculation. The deﬂection of each segment has been assumed
to be very small in comparison to its length.

2 Geometry

The calculation has been carried out for a geometry similar to that of RICH detector
in ALICE [1]. The anode plane consists of gold-tungsten wires with 20µm diameter
with pitch 4.0 mm. The upper cathode plane is made of copper-berrylium wires
with diameter 100µm and pitch 2.0 mm while the lower one is a uniform conducting
plate. The separation of upper and lower cathodes from the anode are respectively
1.68 mm and 1.83 mm and length of the detector in Z-direction is 136.0cm. The
anode plane is supplied with high voltage w.r.t. the cathode planes.

3 Numerical Approach

The second order diﬀerential equation in an equilibrium state of the wire can be
written as

d2y
dz2 + Fe + Fg = 0
where Fe, Fg are the electrostatic and gravitational forces per unit length while T
the stringing tension of the wire. Using three point ﬁnite diﬀerence formula, it can
be rewritten as

(1)

T

yn+1 − 2yn + yn−1 = − 1
T

[Fen + Fgn].(δz)2

where yn, yn+1 and yn−1 represent the deﬂections of respective segments. The elec-
trostatic force on the n-th segment has been computed using neBEM solver for the
given 3D geometry. The required sag due to the action of either of the electrostatic
and gravitational forces or combined may be obtained from this equation. Thus the
set of equations for the segments on a wire can be represented as

(3)

where A is the tridiagonal coeﬃcient matrix whose inverse has been calculated
following standard numerical receipe. In the present work, ﬁve anode wires have
been considered with discretization of 30 linear segments while that of the cathode
plate has been 25 × 30. It should be noted that no plates on the sides of the chamber
have been taken into account.

4 Results and discussions

The calculation procedure has been validated by calculating wire sag due to gravi-
tational force and comparing with the analytic solution for gravitational force only
as

Fg
2T
where Fg = gρπr2 and L, r, ρ are the length, radius and density of the wire respec-
tively. The results has been illustrtaed in ﬁg.1 which has demonstrated the validity
of the method.

Saggita due to Electric force

The wire sag at the centre due to electrostatic force following the solution of
tridiagonal matrix equation [Eqn.3] has been shown as a function of anode volt-
age in ﬁg.3 for anode and cathode wires separately.
It is evident from the re-
sult that the sag in the anode wire changes more rapidly than the cathode wires.
The central wire in the anode plane has
been found to undergo more deﬂection
in comparison to the edge wires. The
calculation of [3] for wire sags in this
chamber has reported less deﬂection in
comparison to our result. In [3], an ad-
ditional restoring electrostatic force has
been considered to be operational when
the wire gets deﬂected which in turn has
helped to reduce the wire sag.
In our
calculation, no such dynamic consider-
ation of the electrostatic force with the
wire deﬂection has been incorporated.
To reproduce the actual wire sags, an
iterative process can be carried out each
time calculating the electrostatic force due to new position of the deﬂected wire.

5 Conclusion

Using the neBEM solver, the electrostatic ﬁeld could be accurately calculated for
the three dimensional geometry of multiwire RICH chamber. An FDM approach to
compute the wire sag has been developed and validated for the case of gravitational
sag calculation. In the present calculation, no restoring eﬀect of electrostatic force
has been considered unlike the earlier work which has led to larger sag estimates.
The restoring force aspect will be implemented in future by iterative technique to
estimate a realistic wire sag in this chamber.

New developments of photodetectors for the lake Baikal neutrino experiment are
described. Some test results of photodetectors at the lake Baikal are presented.

1 Introduction

The lake Baikal Neutrino Experiment has history of more than 20 years, start-
ing from small short experiments with a few PMTs in the early 80s to the
present large scale longterm operating neutrino telescope NT-2001, which has
been put into operation on April 6th 1998. The telescope’s eﬀective area for
muons is 2000-10000 depending on a muon energy. The rate of events due to
atmospheric neutrinos is about 1 per two days.

2 Neutrino telescope NT-200

The lake Baikal Neutrino Telescope NT-200 is located in the southern part
of the great Siberian lake Baikal at 3.6km from the shore and at the depth
of 1km. The schematic view of NT-200 and optical modules attached at a
string are presented in ﬁg.1. The telescope consists of 192 optical modules
at 8 vertical strings arranged at an umbrella like frame. Optical modules are
grouped in pairs and swithched in coincidence with 15ns time window. So two
optical modules in one pair deﬁne one optical channel resulting in rather low
optical channel background counting rate of 100–300Hz. Two pairs of optical
modules form so called svyazka. The detector electronics system is hierar-
chical: from the lowest level to the highest one - optical module electronics,
svyazka electronics module, string and detector electronics modules.
In the
latter detector trigger signals are formed and all information from string elec-
tronics modules are received and sent to the shore station. Three underwater
electrical cables connect the detector with the shore station. The detector is
operated from the shore station.

3 Quasar-370 phototube

The Quasar-370 phototube 2,3,4,5 is a hybrid phototube which consists of an
electro-optical preampliﬁer with large area hemispherical photocathode and
small conventional type PMT, see ﬁg.2. Photoelectrons from a large 37cm di-
ameter hemispherical photocathode with 2π acceptance are accelerated by 25
kV to a fast, high gain luminescent screen (Y SO scintillator is usually used).
The light ﬂashes in luminescent screen induced by photoelectrons are read out
by small PMT with 3cm diameter photocathode. The latter has been devel-
oped especially for this kind of application by INR and MELZ factory 6. As
a result one photoelectron from the hemispherical photocathode yields typ-
ically 25 photoelectrons in the small PMT.This high gain ﬁrst stage results
in an excellent single photoelectron resolution. Due to the fast acceleration
of primary photoelectrons by 25 kV high voltage and mushroom shaped glass
envelope the time jitter can be kept rather low. Last but not the least the
tube is almost insensitive to the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Averaged over more
than 200 tubes the mean values for single photoelectron resolution and time

resolution is 70% and 2ns respectively. Quasar-370 phototube is character-
ized by conspicuously low level of afterpulses in comparison with conventional
PMTs. The level of afterpulses in Quasar-370 tube is substantially less than
1%. Another advantage of Quasar-370 phototube in contrary to conventional
PMTs is the lack of prepulses due to the fact that the ﬁrst stage of the photo-
tube is optically separated from tube’s photocathode. It was shown 2,3,5 that
Quasar-370 parameters depend strongly on characteristics of a scintillator in a
luminescent screen. So recently we have developed a number of modiﬁcations
of Quasar-370 tube with new scintillators. The most promising results we have
got with ScBO3, Y AP and LSO. Unfortunately the latter one has one sub-
stantial drawback for using in Quasar-370 tube. It has rather high value of
Zef f . It is important to note here we need scintillators with Zef f as low as
possible to suppress eﬀectively late pulses 7 due to photoelectron backscatter-
ing eﬀect. With these new scintillators we have reached 1ns (FWHM) time
jitter and 40% single photoelectron resolution. It is noteworthy to mention
here about very much intriguing scintillator8 - ZnO : Ga with less than 1ns
decay time and light yield of 40% of N aI : T l. At present we try to work with
this scintillator and to reproduce results of 8. The success of this work would
undoubtedly be a kind of a breakthrough in designing of very fast and eﬀective
hybrid phototubes.

4 Two-channel optical module

The pairwise ideology pursued in NT-200 neutrino telescope has many advan-
tages. The ideology allows to suppress eﬀectively an individual optical mod-
ule background counting rate due to water luminescence and a phototube’s
dark current, to eliminate phenomena deteriorating phototube’s time resolu-
tion namely prepulses, late pulses and afterpulses. Moreover such an approach
facilitates very much designing of trigger system, data acquisition system etc.
Unfortunately there is just one but essential shortcoming. Namely it’s too ex-
pensive to have two optical modules for one optical channel. To overcome this
problem we have developed two-channel optical module based on two-channel
version of Quasar-370 phototube9.

Two-channel Quasar-370 phototube uses the same electro-optical pream-
pliﬁer and new two-anode small PMT with mesh dynode system instead of
conventional PMT. This new two-anode small PMT has following characteris-

tics: time jitter – σ = 340ps; Peak-to valley ratio of single photoelectron sharge
distribution – 1.5; cross-talks between channels – 1%. Basing on two-channel
Quasar-370 phototube we have developed two-channel optical module which
incorporates besides Quasar-370 phototube two fast transimpedance pream-
pliﬁers for each anode signals and uses the same glass pressure vessel and
In the course
the same penetrators as conventional Baikal optical module.
of the last expedition at the lake Baikal we have tested one pilot sample of
two-channel optical module in frame of a new experimental string designed to
test technological innovations for future neutrino telescopes at the lake. In the
test measurements at the lake we used ordinary but slightly modiﬁed NT-200
front-end electronics. Output signals of each channel are switched in coinci-
dence just in the same way as in NT-200. It results in the same local trigger
counting rate of 100-300Hz. Fig.3 presents the time dependence of muon trig-
ger rate for two conventional Baikal optical channels and new optical channel
based on two-channel optical module. One can see that the new optical channel
has comparable sensitivity to muons with ordinary optical channels of NT-200.
It opens new possibilities for NT-200 further extension plans.

5 Other developments

A new version of Quasar-370 phototube (Quasar-370D) with semiconductor
diode as a photoelectron multiplying element instead of a system of luminescent
screen and small PMT has been developed. We have manufactured two pilot
samples which are under studies now. Modiﬁcations of Quasar-370 phototubes
(Quasar-370G)10 which are able to withstand high current due to night sky
background operate successfully in the wide angle atmospheric air Cherenkov
detectors TUNKA11 and SMECA12. Quasar-370L is low background version
of Quasar-370 phototube. It has U 238 and T h232 content of about 10−8g/g.
Quasar-370L is aimed at using in low background experiments. Another devel-
opment is concerned with phototubes with high quantum eﬃciency (more than
40% in the range 450-550nm) photocathodes and it’s results will be reported
elsewhere.

Conclusion

The lake Baikal Neutrino Experiment successful operation proves high perfor-
mance and high reliability of a number of photodetectors developed for this
kind of application. New developments are focused at future neutrino experi-
ments at the lake Baikal and other experiments in high energy physics, cosmic
ray and astroparticle physics.

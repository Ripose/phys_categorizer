Abstract. We have built and tested a 3.5 m high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot prototype
inteferometer with a precision ellipsometer for the QED test and axion search
(Q & A) experiment. We use X-pendulum-double-pendulum suspension designs
and automatic control schemes developed by the gravitational-wave detection
community. Verdet constant and Cotton-Mouton constant of the air are measured
as a test. Double modulation with polarization modulation 100 Hz and magnetic-
ﬁeld modulation 0.05 Hz gives 10−7 rad phase noise for a 44-minute integration.

1. Introduction

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) predicts that in a background electromagnetic
ﬁeld, vacuum is refractive and birefringent. The refractive indices in a transverse
external magnetic ﬁeld ~Bext are nk = 1 + 3.5α(Bext)
c ) and n⊥ = 1 +
2α(Bext)2/(45πB2
c ) for linearly polarized lights whose polarizations are parallel and
orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld with Bc = m2c3/e¯h = 4.4 × 109 T. For a transverse
magnetic ﬁeld (dipole ﬁeld) of 2.5 T, ∆n = nk − n⊥ = 2.5 × 10−23. This birefringence
is measurable using double-modulation ultra-high sensitive interferometer techniques.
In typical invisible axion models, axion-photon coupling induces both ellipticity and
polarization-rotation for light propagation in a magnetic ﬁeld; these eﬀects are about
7 orders smaller in magnitude compared to the QED birefringence.

In 1994, we proposed the Q & A experiment to measure the vacuum birefringence
and the axion-photon coupling [1], and began to construct and test a 3.5 m high-
ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot prototype inteferometer. In [1], we presented the motivation and
background of this experiment in detail. In [2], we present methods of improvement
and make a comparison of Q & A experiment, PVLAS experiment [3], and BMV
experiment [4]. Here we present the experimental setup, and test-measurement results.

2. Experimental setup of the 3.5 m prototype interferometer

The 3.5 m prototype interferometer (ﬁgure 1) is formed using a high ﬁnesse Fabry-
Perot interferometer together with a high precision ellipsometer. The two high-
reﬂectivity mirrors of the 3.5 m prototype interferometer are suspended separately

from two X-pendulum-double-pendulum suspensions (basically the design of ICRR,
University of Tokyo [5]) mounted on two isolated tables ﬁxed to ground using bellows
inside two vacuum chambers. The characteristics of these vibration isolation sub-
systems are to be discussed in [2]. Other sub-systems are described below.

Laser, cavity and ﬁnesse measurement — We use a 1 W diode-pumped
1064 nm CW Nd:YAG laser made by Laser Zentrum Hannover as light source.
The laser frequency can be tuned using thermal control and PZT control.
We thermal-stabilize the laser at 25
◦C and use Pound-Drever scheme
to lock the laser frequency with the
resonant frequency of the 3.5 m
interferometer. The high-frequency
(> 30 Hz) part of the phase error
from the photodetector is fed to
the PZT to frequency lock the laser
to the cavity resonant frequency;
this

stage ampliﬁcation with lead-leg
compensation.
frequency
part (< 30 Hz) of the phase error
goes to a DSP based digital control
unit to control the cavity length of
the interferometer. The laser goes
through an isolator, a 882 MHz electo-optic modulator and a mode-matching lens to
the 3.5 m cavity. The modulation frequency was chosen as the free spectral range of a
0.17 m mode cleaner which was built but not used. We measure the ﬁnesse of the 3.5
m cavity in 3 ways while the laser was locked to the resonant cavity. Two methods
[6,7] are to analyze the transmission intensity proﬁle, as shown in upper part of ﬁgure
2. The third approach is to measure the life time of intra-cavity photons. Lower part
of ﬁgure 2 shows the decay of transmision intensity when the power of the input light
was suddenly turned oﬀ. All three methods give ﬁnesse 17,000 to within 1 %. This
ﬁnesse enhances the cavity birefringence measurement by 10,800 (2F/π) times.

Polarizing optics and ellipsometry — A Glan-Thompson polarizer with measured
extinction ratio 2.60 × 10−7 is placed before the 3.5 m cavity. A Glan-Laser polarizer

with measured extinction ratio 9.36 × 10−7 is placed behind the cavity as analyzer.
A Faraday glass made of terbium-boron-alumina-silicate oxide with terbium oxide
greater than 50% by weight (Kigre model M-18) is placed before the analyzer for the
purpose of signal modulation. This Faraday glass is housed in a Teﬂon mount wound
around with 2500 turns of 0.2 mm enamel-insulated wire. Modulation response of the
Faraday glass was measured to be η = 0.019 rad A−1. The polarizer, the analyzer and
the Faraday glass form a modulated Malus ellipsometer to measure the intra-cavity
polariztion change. Malus law P = P0(ǫ2 + ψ2) gives the polarization rotation angle ψ
from the power received in the photodetector. ǫ2 is the extinction ratio of the Malus
ellipsometer.

Magnet — We use a switching dipole magnet with a 25.4 mm borehole to induce
the intra-cavity birefringence of the 3.5 m prototype interferometer. This magnet can
generate up to 1.2 T transverse magnetic ﬁeld with an eﬀective magnetic length 0.2
m. A vacuum tube of ID/OD 21.4 mm/24.6 mm goes through the borehole of the
magnet to connect the two mirror-hanging vacuum chambers.

We measure the Faraday rotation of air
(polarization rotation angle ψv = CvB0Lef f )
and determine the Verdet constant Cv using
the 3.5 m prototype interferometer. We
use a 0.4 m long home-made solenoid to
apply a 100 Hz axial magnetic ﬁeld B =
B0cos(ωt), to the 3.5 m cavity. From the
response of the photodetector, we obtain
the polarization signal ρ ≡ P/P0 = ǫ2 +
(4F 2)/(π2)[(∆ψ2
v)/(2) + (∆ψ2
v)/(2)(cos(2ωt))]. When the amplitude of applied
magnetic ﬁeld is varied from 4.4 × 10−4 T to 8.8 × 10−4 T, the 200 Hz demodulated
signals gives ∆ψ2

determines the Verdet constant to be Cv = (3.91 ± 0.02)× 10−4 rad T−1m−1 at 25.5◦C
and 1 atm for λ = 1064 nm.

Cotton-Mouton eﬀect is quadratic to transverse magnetic ﬁeld: ψCM = πCCM B2Lef f .
For measuring the Cotton-Mouton eﬀect, we replace the axial ﬁeld by the transverse
ﬁeld B = B0 + Bmcos(ωmt) of the switching magnet and follow a similar procedure
as described above. Since the alignment of the magnet axis and optical axis is
not perfect, there is a small axial magnetic ﬁeld Bax = kB to induce a Faraday
rotation. The detected polarization signal ρ contains both Faraday rotation and

In order to estimate the sensi-
tivity of prototype interferome-
ter, we Fourier analyze the dou-
ble modulated signal (polariza-
tion modulation at 100 Hz us-
ing Faraday glass and magnetic
ﬁeld moduation at 0.05 Hz us-
ing switching dipole magnet) to
obtain power sprectrum using
Welch’s average and Hanning
window. The noise ﬂoor near
modulated frequency 100 Hz ±
0.05 Hz is around 10−7 rad (5 × 10−6 rad Hz−1/2) as shown in ﬁgure 5 for a 44-minute
integration. With improved optical sensitivity, higher-frequency magnetic ﬁeld mod-
ulation, larger magnetic ﬁeld, and interferometer length extended to 7 m, we expect
to measure vacuum birefringence in due time [2].

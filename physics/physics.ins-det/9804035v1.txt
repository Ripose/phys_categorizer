MSGC Development for HERA-B

Physikalisches Institut, University of Heidelberg, Philosophenweg 12,

D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany

B. SCHMIDT

The Inner Tracker System of the HERA-B experiment at DESY is build by groups 1
at the Universities of Heidelberg, Siegen and Z¨urich. The system consists of 184
Microstrip-Gas-Chambers (MSGC) with a total number of 147 456 electronic
channels. The detectors have to cope with particle ﬂuxes up to 25 kHz mm−2
and to tolerate radiation doses of 1 Mrad per year. During the development of
these chambers it was found that conventional MSGC, operated in intense hadronic
ﬂuxes, are rapidly destroyed due to the phenomenon of induced discharges. The
introduction of a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) as preampliﬁcation structure
oﬀers the possibility to build robust and reliable detectors allowing for ample gain
reserve in the hostile environment of HERA-B.

1 Introduction

The goal of HERA-B is to establish CP violation in B-decays 2. As source
of the B mesons, an internal wire target in the 800 MeV proton beam line
of HERA is used. Thus HERA-B is a ﬁxed target experiment of type forward
spectrometer. The speciﬁc requirements of the detector elements are due to the
enormous amount of 4 ×1014 events which have to be recorded per year and
from which about 1000 of the rare decays into J/ΨKs have to be extracted.

This means that HERA-B has to run at a mean interaction rate of 40 MHz.
Four overlayed events per bunch crossing every 96 nsec with a mean number
of about 200 tracks have to be recorded and analyzed. The events are strongly
boosted in the forward direction and about half of the tracks have to be
followed in the Inner Tracker system, covering the area from 5-30 cm around the
beam pipe. As solution for the inner tracker detector elements, Microstrip-Gas-
Chambers3 (MSGC) were foreseen and are, in the new version as GEM-MSGC 4,
the now approved and accepted technology.

2 The parameters of the HERA-B Inner Tracker

The task of the Inner Tracker detectors is twofold since they have to deliver
tracking information and to provide fast signals for the ﬁrst level trigger
simultaneously. The tracking requirements are rather moderate, 100 µm resolution
in the bending plane and 1 mm resolution parallel to the B-ﬁeld are suﬃcient.
Part of the detectors have to operate in a magnetic ﬁeld of 0,85 T.

1

The tracking information is obtained in the conventional way using analog
signals from individual strips. The second coordinate is measured from stereo
layers under small angles (5o) with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld. The small
stereo angles are necessary to keep the combinatorial background reasonably
small.

For the trigger signals 4 neighbouring strips are electrically ored to reduce
the number of trigger channels while keeping the occupancy at the 10-15 %
level. To enhance the trigger eﬃciency, all trigger layers are double layers of
identical orientation. The chambers have to cope with particle ﬂuxes up to 104
particles per mm2 and second, accumulating to a total radiation dose of up to
1 Mrad per year. The fundamental question of MSGC development and design
was to ﬁnd a solution which guarantees a stable operation with high gain and
high eﬃciency over several years of HERA-B operation.

The demand for fast trigger signals puts speciﬁc boundary conditions to
the operating parameters of the chambers. The pulse shaping has to be done
in a way that pile up and resulting fake triggers in successive bunch crossings
are kept at tolerable low level. A possible shaping as it could be realized with
the foreseen Helix pre-ampliﬁer is shown as inset in ﬁgure 1.

Taking the charge collection time, the ion movement and the ampliﬁer
shaping into account it becomes apparent that the eﬃctive number of electrons
contributing to the signal at optimal sampling time (95 nsec after bunch
crossing) has a broad distribution with a mean number of only 15.6 electrons
(Figure 1). Taking 7000 electrons as a realistic threshold for a strip capacity
of 40 pF (25 cm long strips) it turns out that a minimal gas gain above 2000
is required to exceed the 95 % eﬃciency level.

Simultaneously the number of fake triggers due to pulse ﬂuctuations into
the subsequent bunch crossing does not exceed 25 %. (Figure 2). It should be
mentioned that the rather delicate balance between eﬃciency and fake trigger
rate requires a suﬃciently high uniformity of gas gain, electronic ampliﬁcation
and trigger threshold.

To summarize the scope of the project, a few numbers should be given:
The Inner Tracker of HERA-B will consist of 46 detector planes grouped into
10 superlayers consisting of 184 MSGC and covering a total area of about
16 m2. 147456 channels are equiped with analog read-out and 9984 fast trigger
signals provided for the ﬁrst level trigger.

The entire project comprising the development of the chambers, the infra-
structure and the read-out electronics is realized by groups at the universities
of Heidelberg, Siegen and Z¨urich.

3 Early ﬁndings and solutions

At the time of the technical design report (1994) the development of MSGC
for high rate operation seemed to be settled.

Unfortunately it turned out rather quickly, that the misgivings of various
people were justiﬁed and the available MSGC technology did not allow a stable
operation at high rates on a time scale required for HERA-B. Even observing
the strongest precautions for gas quality and chamber material, the detectors
died suddenly after collecting only moderate amounts of total charge. Typical
examples 5 are given in ﬁgure 3. Especially operation at the required high gains
turned out to be very short lived.

The reason for that delicacy comes from the fact, that in a MSGC, produced
on bare glass plates with ionic conductivity, the electric ﬁeld close to the
surface strongly depends on the distribution of the ions in the glass. Under the
combined action of radiation and electric ﬁelds this distribution is disturbed
in a way, that the gas gain ﬁnally breaks together and stable operation is
not longer possible. To get rid of accumulating surface charges only electronic
conductivity of the substrate promise a steady and uniform operation. Electronically
conductive glass is not available in the required large plates and ruled out due
to its very short radiation length.

From a variety of eﬀorts to ﬁnd an adequate stable surface coating of
the glass 7 the diamond like coating (DLC) with amorphous carbon using a
plasma CVD process 6,7 turned out to be the most promising solution. The
DLC coatings could be well adjusted to the required surface conductivity of
1014 − 1016 Ω per square and oﬀer reasonable surface quality for the MSGC
production process.

The successful reproduction of the pioneering results of reference 6 showing
stable operation even under strong conditions and high gas gains, mark the ﬁrst
milestone of MSGC development for HERA-B (Figure 4).

4 The phenomenon of induced discharges

After a variety of successful tests in the lab we went on a ﬁrst hadronic beam
test with fullsize HERA-B chambers at PSI in April 1996. There we made the
painful discovery that testing with x-rays in the lab is not suﬃcient to simulate
the conditions of high intensity hadronic beams. As a new phenomenon we
observed frequent anode-cathode discharges visible as short current spikes
under conditions where the chambers operated with x-rays of similar intensity
completely quietly and unconspecious. After a few hours operation, an alarming
number of anodes was broken 8.

3

Visual inspection of the chambers showed an enormous number of correlated
marks in anodes and cathodes in the area where the chamber had been exposed
to the beam (Figure 5). Part of them had led to anode breaks. The fact that
comparable phenomena had never been observed with x-rays or with β-sources
but only in the hadronic beam made it fair to assume that the discharges are
induced by heavy ionizing particles. In a hadronic beam these heavy ionizing
particles can be easily produced by nuclear reactions in the MSGC substrate.
To simulate these conditions and to verify the assumption we introduced
a gaseous α-source in the chamber by ﬂushing the counting gas through a
cylinder containing thorium oxyde 8. The Rn-220 emanating from the thorium
powder is transported to the chamber with the gas stream and decays with
the half life of 55 s emitting 6,3 MeV α-particles. In fact the phenomenon
of induced discharges could be reproduced with all aspects: current spikes,
anode-cathode marks and ﬁnally broken anodes.

A concluding test of the chambers at the HERA-B beam line made clear
that under nominal conditions of a gas gain around 3000 the chambers are
destroyed within a few hours. In the following we concentrated all eﬀorts to
study this phenomenon of induced discharges in more detail in view of how to
avoid it and to extend the lifetime of the chambers.

From the bulk of results 9 the most important will be summarized here.

Figure 6 shows a strong dependence of the discharge rate on the cathode
potential at constant gas gain. The obvious recommendation from this is to
operate the chamber at the highest possible drift ﬁeld. For a constant cathode
potential no dependence of the discharge rate on the drift ﬁeld could be
observed, even if the drift ﬁeld was reversed (Figure 7). This could be taken
as a strong evidence that the triggering high primary ionization has to be
produced very close to the MSGC surface.

With special emphasis we checked the possibility to reduce the proneness to
induce discharges by changing the composition and the nature of the counting
gas. For various reasons (aging, drift velocity, diﬀusion, density of primary
ionization) Ar/DME 50:50 was chosen at the optimal composition till then.
Within the scope of these investigations we studied diﬀerent Ar/DME mixtures
as well as mixtures of Ne/DME, Ar/CO2, Ar/DEE with water, alcohol, methylal
and ammonia as additives.

Unfortunately, none of these mixtures turned out to be signiﬁcantly less
prone to induce discharges than the standard Ar/DME mixture. For identical
gas gain all mixtures exhibited comparable discharge rates under the inﬂuence
of the gasous α-source.

As a typical example ﬁgure 8 shows the discharge rate in two diﬀerent

Ar/DME mixtures:

of the gas composition.

For identical gain and drift ﬁeld the discharge rate is completely independent

Another interesting observation is the fact that MSGC on uncoated and resistively
coated substrates show quite diﬀerent discharge rates under otherwise identical
conditions. If we take the pulse height to deﬁne the operation point of the
chamber, the discharge rate on uncoated plates is reduced by a gain dependend
factor between 10 and 20 compared to diamond coated MSGC’s (Figure 9).

The reason for that becomes obvious from ﬁgure 10, where for both cases
the strength of the electric ﬁeld between anode and cathode is shown for various
heights above the MSGC plane.a For the coated plate, a constant surface
restistivity was assumed whereas the ﬁeld for the uncoated plate was calculated
using inﬁnite surface resistivity.

Since the actual ion distribution is not known, the latter has to be taken
as an approximation to the real conditions. Whereas for uncoated plates the
anode-cathode ﬁeld is strongly peaked close to the electrodes with a broad
regime of strongly reduced ﬁeld in between, coated plates have an almost
uniform ﬁeld between anode and cathode. The low ﬁeld regime on uncoated
plates eﬃciently stops the evolution of streamers and suppresses the tendency
for induced discharges.

Summarizing we have to conclude, that induced discharges are an intrinsic
problem of the MSGC geometry and principal; gain and discharge rate are
strongly entangled parameters.

Under any reasonable condition chambers operated at gas gains around
3000, even using a very high drift ﬁeld of 10 kV/cm, are severly damaged within
hours running under HERA-B conditions. This sad conclusion we veriﬁed
experimentally in December 1996. To survive 5 years the discharge rate has to
be reduced by 4 orders of magnitude, resulting in a gas gain below 1000 and a
marginal eﬃciency of the device.

In view of this universal nature of the induced discharge phenomenon we tried
to ﬁnd out if the tolerance of the chamber to discharges can be positively
eﬀected by using a clever strip material. In fact we learned very soon, that gold
strips are extremely delicate whereas chromium strips tolerate an enormous
number of sparks before showing visible marks or even anode breaks 10.

For gold strips on the other hand the charge stored in the capacity of a

single anode-cathode system with 10 cm long strips is suﬃcient to damage the
anode in a single discharge severely. Unfortunately, the resistivity of chromium
is that high that the signal risetime for strips longer than a few centimeters
become unacceptably long for a fast detector. After troublesome experiments
with electrodes made from gold, chromium, aluminum, rhodium 9 and tungsten
10 we had to conclude that it is the mere resistivity and resulting current
limitation what protects the electrodes from being damaged. Spark tolerance
and fast signals are therefore incompatible requirements.

5 The GEM-MSGC

The recovery of the HERA-B MSGC tracker came with the introduction of the
Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) by F. Sauli 11. The basic idea is to separate
the total gas gain in two independent factors both suﬃciently small to strongly
suppress induced discharges. The initial major concerns against the technology
of the GEM-MSGC where as follows:

• Does it really solve the induced discharge problem or is the total achievable
gain now limited by induced GEM- or combined GEM-MSGC discharges?

• How is the eﬃciency, the strip multiplicity and the resolution of such a

device especially if operated in a magnetic ﬁeld?

• What is the long term stability of the GEM in view of aging and the

negative experience with uncoated glass plates?

Since March 1997 we tried to answer these questions in fruitful collaboration
with F. Sauli and his team at CERN. The most fundamental answer we got
rather quickly:

The GEM-MSGC showed now induced discharges under the combined action of
the gaseous-a source and an x-ray charge load of 20 times HERA-B conditions,
even when operated at total gas gains above 4000. After troublefree operation
of a prototype chamber at the HERA-B beamline with full interaction rate
and a total gas gain of 3000 for more than 58 hours we came to the conclusion
that the problem of induced discharges is solved by using a GEM-MSGC
combination.

The second concern could be settled using the electron test beam at DESY in
July 1997. As shown in ﬁgure 11, the eﬃciency of the GEM-MSGC is excellent
and completely uneﬀected by a magnetic ﬁeld of 0.85 T parallel to the strips.

6

Operated with Ar/DME 50:50 the strip multiplicity at 95 % eﬃciency is 1.65
for 300 µm wide strips, only slightly higher than without the GEM (1.4).

The long term behaviour and aging properties of the GEM-MSGC was
one of the main concerns which ﬁnally could be dispeled by pain staking tests
at Heidelberg and CERN. The problem was aggravated by the fact that not
only the GEM introduced new materials in the chamber but also the more
robust frame replacing our initial glass tube design. All GEM’s produced on
polyimid foil exhibit time dependend and local gain variations whose amplitude
depends on the details of the GEM geometry. Part of these variations are due
to surface charge and can be avoided by adding a small amount of water to
the counting gas. Another part has to do with polarization of the polyimid foil
and is unaﬀected by the gas humidity.

Unfortunately adding water to the gas negatively aﬀects the aging properties

at the MSGC surface. With 3000 ppm of water we observed a very rapid
degradation of the MSGC gain which turned out to be due to deposits on the
anode strips. Both, Ar/DME and Ar/CO2 mixtures behaved very similarly
and thus excluded the use of water admixture to reduce surface charge.

In ﬁgure 12 the behaviour of otherwise identical chambers with and without

water admixture are confronted.

The entire gain history of a GEM-MSGC running with Ar/DME up to
an accumulated rate corresponding to 3.5 years of HERA-B operation at gain
3000 is shown in ﬁgure 13. The initial gain excursion by a factor of 1.5 is clearly
seen as well as the stabilisation after a few days of operation. After the initial
period the gain is constant even if the chamber is switched oﬀ and repowered
after several hours.

The GEM-MSGC obviously is a device that can be expected to run reliably
under HERA-B conditions with high rates for several years. Even if the initial
gain variations as well as the local ﬂuctuations of the GEM ampliﬁcation factor
are no fundamental problem for the envisaged HERA-B tracker, they are a
drawback making the operation of the chamber and the deﬁnition of the trigger
threshold more delicate.

Recently it has been shown by the HERA-B group at Siegen that both
eﬀects can be completely avoided by overcoating the GEM with a high resistive
layer of amorphous carbon using the same plasma technology as for the MSGC
plate. If this technology can be successfully applied to the sizes as needed for the
HERA-B chambers, it would further enhance the performance of the detectors.

6 Passivation of strip ends

Passivation of the strip ends is usually done by coating this dangerous area
by insulating glue either inside or outside the counting gas volume. In our
initial design the passivation was combined with the gluing of the frame on
the MSGC plate. With this technology it is unavoidable that small amounts of
glue protrude on the MSGC surface leading to the situation shown in ﬁgure 14
with an insulating layer on top of the electrodes inside the counting gas. For
whatever reasons such topping insulators are introduced, they are a source of
potential severe trouble.

In ﬁgure 15 we show the time dependent calculation of the electric ﬁeld
under these conditions. The insulator surface is charged until no more ﬁeld
lines ending there. By this very dangerous hot spots right after the edge of the
insulator are created. At these points the chamber is prone to discharges in
radiation ﬁelds even at very moderate gains below 1000.

Fortunately the problem can be cured in a very elegant way, by just leaving
the strip ends unpassivated without any coating in the counting gas volume.
We veriﬁed experimentally that free, properly designed, strip ends will not
cause any trouble even under the combined action of the gaseous α-source and
a very heavy x-ray load of several times HERA-B conditions. This positive
result could be conﬁrmed in the high-intensity pion beam at PSI in Switzerland.
Avoiding the notorious strip end passivation strongly simpliﬁes the chamber
construction and reduces the demands on the glue and the gluing procedure.

7 Status and prospects of chamber production

The MSGC plates for the HERA-B inner tracker are designed by the HERA-
B group at the University of Z¨urich and produced at IMT in Greifensee,
Switzerland. Meanwhile a ﬁrst batch of 40 plates for the 1998 preseries has
been produced. The diamond coating was done at Fraunhofer-Institut f¨ur
Schicht- und Oberﬂ¨achentechnik, Braunschweig. These coatings are of very
good homogenity and surface quality. All GEM’s have been designed by Fabio
Sauli and produced at the CERN workshop. Now in January 1998, we have
started the production of a preseries of chambers which will be installed for
the 1998 running of HERA-B. During this year the mass production of the full
set of about 200 chambers is foreseen. Installation and commissioning of the
chambers will take place in the winter shut-down of HERA 1998/99.

Figure 12: Long term behaviour of a GEM-MSGC operated with Ar-DME 50:50 with 
and without addition of water vapour. The gain loss in the case of water admixture is 
caused by the formation of deposits along the anode strips.

Figure 13: Long term behaviour of the relative gain of a GEM-MSGC starting with a 
virginal GEM. The gas was Ar/DME 50:50 and the total gain was 3000. The gain 
variations are entirely due to variations of the GEM amplification factor. The 
irradiated area was 500 mm2.

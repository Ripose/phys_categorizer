Abstract

Muon energy measurement represents an important issue for any
experiment addressing neutrino induced upgoing muon studies. Since
the neutrino oscillation probability depends on the neutrino energy,
a measurement of the muon energy adds an important piece of
information concerning the neutrino system. We show in this paper
how the MACRO limited streamer tube system can be operated in
drift mode by using the TDC’s included in the QTPs, an electronics
designed for magnetic monopole search. An improvement of the space
resolution is obtained, through an analysis of the multiple scattering
of muon tracks as they pass through our detector. This information
can be used further to obtain an estimate of the energy of muons
crossing the detector. Here we present the results of two dedicated
tests, performed at CERN PS-T9 and SPS-X7 beam lines, to provide
a full check of the electronics and to exploit the feasibility of such a
multiple scattering analysis. We show that by using a neural network
approach, we are able to reconstruct the muon energy for Eµ <40 GeV.
The test beam data provide an absolute energy calibration, which
allows us to apply this method to MACRO data.

1 Introduction

The most recent studies of neutrino induced up-going muons have been
performed by two experiments:
Super–Kamiokande[1], using a water
Cherenkov detector, and MACRO[2], tagging neutrino events with a time
of ﬂight technique. Both experiments observed a ﬂux deﬁcit and a distortion
of the up-going muon angular distribution with respect to the Monte
Carlo expectation. The oscillation probability of neutrinos depends on the
oscillation parameters (∆m2, sin22θ) and on the ratio L/E, where L is the
distance between neutrino production and interaction point, while E is the
neutrino energy. The energy of up-going neutrinos, interacting in the rock
below the apparatus, is shared by the up-going muon and by the hadrons.
Independent of the detector resolution, a precise measurement of the muon
energy is prevented by the energy lost by the muon in the rock, while the
hadrons are absorbed in the rock. Nevertheless the residual muon energy
can in principle be measured.
In this paper we explore the possibility of
performing such a measurement relying on muon multiple scattering(MS).
The r.m.s. of the lateral displacement of the muon trajectory on a projected
plane of material with depth X and radiation length Xo, can be written as:

For a given amount of crossed material, the capability of measuring
track deﬂection is possible only when the particle displacement due to the
multiple scattering is larger than the detector space resolution. The space
point resolution of the tracking system of MACRO’s (3x3)cm2 cross section
streamer tubes is of the order of 1 cm, and therefore provides a muon
(10−3eV 2)
energy estimate through MS up to

energy in MACRO, 11 GeV[3], the oscillation probability is still as high as
50%(Fig. 1), while it’s just 10% for Eµ=40 GeV: an improvement of the space
resolution oﬀers the possibility of evaluating muon energy over a suﬃciently
wide energy range.

In order to achieve this goal, we retrieve drift time information from the
limited streamer tubes by using the TDC’s implemented in the MACRO
QTP electronic system[5].

In this paper we describe the application of this electronics to evaluate
the MS eﬀect along a muon track, showing the results obtained with two
dedicated tests, performed at CERN PS-T9 and SPS-X7 beam lines,
in
October 2000 and August 2001 respectively. The application of the method
to MACRO data is then presented.

2 The MACRO limited streamer tubes in

drift mode

The MACRO streamer tube system[6] consists of about 5,600 chambers; each
chamber is made of 8 streamer tubes with cross section (3x3)cm2 and 1200
cm length, for a total of about 50,000 wires. These tubes were built in
“coverless” mode, i.e. the electric ﬁeld of the inner four walls is not exactly
the same. Despite this feature as well as the large cell dimension, the intrinsic
space resolution of these chambers can be quite good, as demonstrated in
([7]) where using a MACRO streamer tube in drift mode, a resolution of
σ
250µm was obtained using standard Lecroy 2228A TDC (0.25 ns/bin).
Such resolution has to be considered as the ultimate resolution achievable
with this device.

≃

Although the MACRO streamer tube electronics does not contain a high
resolution TDC system, information on streamer timing can be extracted
using the QTP system[5]. This electronics, designed for our magnetic
monopole search[4], consists of a ADC/TDC system and acts as a 640 µs
memory, during which the charge, the arrival time and the width of the

5

≥

streamer pulse of the particle crossing the cell are recorded. A slow particle
10−4) may take more than 500 µs to cross the detector. The
in MACRO (β
QTP-TDC system allows us to distinguish randomly distributed background
hits in this time window from a genuine slow particle, which, during the
crossing time of the detector, describes a line in the space-time plane.
For the magnetic monopole reconstruction optimization, a distributed clock
of 20/3 MHz was chosen, resulting in an equivalent TDC bin width of
∆T
150 ns. This clock frequency is quite coarse for drift time measurements
in a single cell, given that the maximum drift time for MACRO streamer
tubes, operated with a He(73%)/n-pentane(27%) mixture, is
600ns. The
ultimate resolution that can be therefore obtained with such a system is
σ
1.9mm, which is about an order of magnitude greater
than the intrinsic precision of the streamer tube, operated in drift mode.
Nevertheless,
it would be
if such improved resolution could be achieved,
suﬃcient to estimate up-going muon energies up to 30-40 GeV.

In order to reduce the number of electronic channels, a single MACRO
QTP channel, serves the OR of 4 chambers, for a total of 32 wires. Selecting
only planes with a single ﬁred tube, the association with the ﬁred QTP
channel is uniquely determined.

Given that our electronics was not designed for drift time measurements,
the relative linearity was tested only for the much larger time scale of 500µs
rather than 600 ns. To avoid any systematic eﬀects and to fully understand
the capability of the QTP system in this context, we decided to test the
electronics in a beam test at CERN PS-T9.

3 Streamer tube system performance in drift

mode

To study the QTP-TDC’s linearity, the drift velocity in He/n-pentane
mixture and to develop the software used for muon tracking, we performed
a test beam run in CERN PS-T9 beamline in October 2000.

For these tests, we reproduced a slice of the MACRO detector using 14

coverless streamer tube chambers, (25

MACRO gas mixture. The rock absorbers reproduced as much as possible
32)cm3, ﬁlled with rock
those of MACRO. We built 7 iron boxes, (40
excavated from the Gran Sasso tunnel (ρ=2.0 g/cm3). As in MACRO, each
streamer tube chamber was equipped with a streamer tube read-out card
and the analog output of a chamber was sent to a QTP channel. The digital
output, OR of each chamber signals, was sent to a Lecroy 2228A TDC.
Such double measurement of the drift time allowed us to make a comparison
between QTP-TDC’s and Lecroy TDC’s on an event by event basis. The
test beam layout is shown in Fig. 2. The trigger was provided by a fast
coincidence of the scintillators S1, S2, S3. The last scintillator, following
a 60 cm iron slab, suppresses the π,K contamination in the beam at high
energies. The data acquisition was performed using LabView, running on
a MacIntosh Quadra 950. Fig. 3 shows the plateau curve of the streamer
tubes used in the test beam. We operated these chambers at HV=4050 V,
where a full eﬃciency is reached. We collected 60 runs, with the beam
stoppers closed, for a total of about 105 muons, with energy ranging from 2
to 12 GeV. Several runs were also taken with the rock absorbers removed,
to study the QTP electronics and to allow for space resolution evaluation,
without contributions of multiple scattering in the absorbers at these low
muon energies.

First, we evaluated the QTP-TDC’s linearity, by comparing its data
with that recorded by the Lecroy TDC’s. Fig. 4 shows the relationship
between these two measurements, for values of the QTP-TDC system(75 ns,
225 ns, 375 ns, 525 ns), where we took the average of the Lecroy TDC’s time
distribution. The errors represents the width of the QTP-TDC’s and the rms
of the corresponding Lecroy-TDC time distributions.

Although the maximum drift time in our streamer tubes is about 600
ns, due to the non-homogeneity of the electric ﬁeld in the streamer tube
600 ns is not uniformly populated. We

Considering the coarseness of QTP-TDC we conclude that the comparison

We then studied the drift velocity in He/n-pentane mixture. Since in the

The evaluation of vdrif t can be therefore obtained ﬁtting the Lecroy TDC
spectrum distribution.

Fig.

5 shows the experimental results obtained, where we have
superimposed the results of a GARFIELD[8] simulation for comparison. Such
code performs a detailed simulation of electron drift and signal generation in
gaseous wire detectors. We described the electrostatic structure of a limited
streamer tube (an anode wire at the center of a square cross section cathode)
by means of a lattice made of 81 wires, spaced by 3 cm, kept at the proper
voltage (alternating the sign): the central cell in this lattice corresponds
to the actual cell. The drift velocity as a function of electric ﬁeld has
been computed assuming the standard MACRO gas mixture by using the
GARFIELD-MagBoltz interface. The experimental data are in agreement
with the simulation.

Once the TDC linearity has been checked and the vdrif t has been
measured, the test beam data can be used to measure the space resolution.
Fig. 6 shows the residuals distribution for streamer tubes in drift mode
using the Lecroy TDC’s and the QTP-TDC system. Using the LeCroy
TDC data, we ﬁnd a resolution of 500 µm, while for the QTP-TDC data
we obtained a resolution of σ

4 Study of the MACRO space resolution

To estimate the performance of the streamer tubes operated in drift mode in
MACRO, we analysed a down-going muon sample, whose average energy is
<Eµ>

320 GeV[9].

≃

The analysis was performed by using the following steps:

1) We considered the muon track reconstructed with the standard MACRO
tracking (i.e. no QTP information is used at this stage);
2) We selected those hits containing only a single ﬁred tube;
3) For each hit we looked at the corresponding QTP-TDC value in a time
window of 2 µs. Given the background rate in the MACRO streamer tubes,
480 Hz on 4 chambers ( 1 QTP channel ),
10−3 for a spurious hit to mimic a genuine QTP - TDC

count;
4) After converting the TDC values to drift radii, by using the drift velocity
measured in the test beam, a global ﬁt of the track is performed.

40 Hz/m2, this corresponds to

≃

As a ﬁrst step, we used this procedure to perform an alignment of the
detector database. The standard MACRO database was computed using
the streamer tube data in digital mode, hence to take advantage of the
improved space resolution achieved by this method, we ﬁrst had to upgrade
106
the precision of the detector database. To accomplish this we used 15
down-going muon tracks. Since the MACRO streamer tubes, 1200 cm long,
are made of PVC, a ﬂexible material, part of the misalignment may come
from the deviation from a straight line along the main axis of each streamer
tube (sagitta eﬀect). We therefore divided the streamer tube length in six
slices and computed the residuals in each slice separately. We generated a
matrix of (14,2304,6) elements, where the ﬁrst index runs over the number
of horizontal planes, the second over the wire number and the last over the
portion of the wire along its main axis. We adopted an iterative procedure,
by adding at each step, for each element of the matrix, the mean value
of the gaussian of the residuals belonging to each portion of wire. As a
results of this procedure, Fig. 7 shows the distribution of the track residuals

for the MACRO streamer tube system in drift mode(black circles) and the
MACRO simulation, GEANT based, (continuous line). The residuals of
the down-going muons have a σ = 3mm,
in good agreement with the
MACRO simulation. The continuous line shows the residuals distribution
for the streamer tube system in digital mode (σ = 1cm), where we see an
improvement of the resolution by a factor

3.5 has been obtained.

For MACRO data however, we expect the resolution to be worse than that
measured in the PS-T9 test beam (σ=2mm) due to two eﬀects. From our
simulation, the most important contribution accounting for this diﬀerence,
comes from δ -rays and radiated photons produced in the rock absorbers.
Both of these eﬀects spoil the space resolution by producing streamers closer
to the wire than those coming from the muon, resulting in smaller drift
radii. Moreover the MACRO down-going muons, despite an average energy
of <Eµ>
320 GeV still suﬀer multiple scattering, mainly coming from the
low energy tail of this distribution.

The sigma of the residuals obtained with Eµ=100 GeV and rock absorbers

the MACRO down-going muon data.

5 Muon energy estimate

A muon energy estimate can be performed in MACRO by measuring the
amount of muon multiple scattering in the rock absorbers. The tests
performed at CERN PS/SPS beam lines, allowed us to demonstrate this
as well as oﬀer the possibility of calibrating the MACRO system.

For each muon event we computed the following variables, sensitive to
muon multiple scattering. The ﬁrst three variables are just outputs from the
track ﬁtting procedure:

10

1) The highest residual of the 14 measurements;
2) The average of the residuals; and
3) The standard deviation of the residuals.
For each track, we then considered the hit with the highest height and that
with the lowest height in the lower part of the detector ( i.e. excluding the
Attico hits). Then we selected a median hit, having the maximum distance
in height from the other two hits. From this we constructed the next two
variables:
4) The diﬀerence of the residuals of the highest hit and of the median hit; and
5) The diﬀerence of the residuals of the lowest hit and of the median hit.

Lastly, we deﬁned a “progressive ﬁt” as the absolute value of the residual
di(i=1,14) as a function of the height of the streamer tube plane. For a high
energy muon, the average residual is roughly constant in the diﬀerent planes,
since the muon energy is almost constant while crossing the experimental
setup. For instance a 20 GeV muon looses less than 5% of his energy after
crossing the detector. In contrast, a low energy muon looses a high fraction
of its energy, by ionization, crossing the rock absorbers. As a result, the
average residuals are higher for the last crossed planes. A linear ﬁt of the
absolute value of the residuals as a function of the streamer tube number,
gives a small slope for high energy muons, while the slope is much larger
for low energy muons. Guided by this analysis we introduce the following
variables:
6) The slope of the “progressive-ﬁt”; and
7) The intercept of the “progressive-ﬁt”.

We followed a neural network approach(NN) in this analysis, choosing
JETNET 3.0[10], a standard package with a multilayer perceptron
architecture and with back-propagation updating. The NN was conﬁgured
with 7 input variables quoted above and 1 hidden layer, selecting the
Manhattan upgrading function. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the variables
quoted above and of the neural network output for muons with energy
Eµ=100 GeV(continuous line) and for muons with energy Eµ=2 GeV(dotted

function of the muon energy up to Eµ≃
40 GeV, saturating at higher energies.
The data collected during the PS test beam, provide an absolute energy
calibration of the method, up to muon energy of 12 GeV. In order to check
the neural network output in the whole energy range of Fig. 10, we used the
data collected at the CERN SPS-X7 beam line.

In Fig.

10 the test beam data and the Monte Carlo prediction are
compared: empty squares represent the Monte Carlo expectation, black
circles show the PS-T9 test beam points, while full triangles are the SPS-
X7 test beam data. The NN output obtained with the test beam data is
properly reproduced by the Monte Carlo simulation. The muon energy can
be reconstructed by inverting the curve shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 11 and
Table 1 show the reconstructed energy for Eµ=2,4,12,40 GeV: data collected
at PS-T9 test beam(full squares) and at SPS-X7 test beam (full triangles)
are compared with the Monte Carlo expectation(continuous line), showing a
reasonable agreement.

6 Conclusions

The use of the QTP-TDC’s, oﬀers the possibility of using the MACRO
limited streamer tube system in drift mode. The test beam run performed
at CERN PS-T9 conﬁrmed such possibility. The QTP system allows us to
improve the streamer tube system space resolution by a factor of
3.5, from
σ
3 mm. These improvements were realized by using a neural
network approach in order to obtain an energy estimate of muons crossing

the detector. The average neural network output increases as a function of
the muon energy up to
40 GeV. The comparison between Monte Carlo
expectation and the test beam data shows a good agreement. This method
oﬀers the possibility to estimate the muon energy for neutrino induced
upgoing muons in MACRO and thus to investigate the energy dependence
of the neutrino oscillation signal.

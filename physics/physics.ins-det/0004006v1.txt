Abstract

A Negative Ion Time Projection Chamber was used to measure the ﬁeld dependence
of lateral and longitudinal diﬀusion for CS2 anions drifting in mixtures of CS2 and
Ar at 40 Torr. Ion drift velocities and limits on the capture distance for electrons
as a function of ﬁeld and gas mixture are also reported.

1 Introduction

The Directional Recoil Identiﬁcation From Tracks (DRIFT) detector has recently
been proposed [1] to search for dark matter. This detector is unique in that it drifts
negative ions, instead of electrons, in a time projection chamber (TPC). A detailed de-
scription of the operation, motivation, and other uses of a negative ion TPC (NITPC)
can be found in [2]. Brieﬂy, an electronegative component in the gas captures ionized
electrons forming negative ions. These anions then drift to the anode wires where,
provided the electronegative component allows it, the anions are ionized and normal
electron avalanche occurs. The motivation for such an arrangement is that it allows
transport of charge to the anode with the minimum possible diﬀusion. Using a pro-
portional chamber, Crane showed that CS2 has the desired electronegative properties
[3]. Using a single wire drift chamber of unusual design, Martoﬀ et al. [2] measured
the drift velocity and lateral diﬀusion of CS2 ions in two diﬀerent gas mixtures. In

this paper we used a NITPC to measure the drift velocity, lateral diﬀusion and lon-
gitudinal diﬀusion in a variety of CS2-Ar gas mixtures. These measurements allowed
limits to be set on the electron capture distance in these mixtures.

2 Theory

The diﬀusion of charged particles being drifted through a gas has been parameterized
by an expression of the form [4]:

σ2 =

4εkL
3eE

(1)

where L is the drift distance, E is the drift ﬁeld and εk is the characteristic (average)
energy of the electron or ion. For electrons, εk varies from thermal (∼ kBT ) at low
drift ﬁelds to several eV at higher E/p. The nonlinear variation of εk for electrons
arises from the mass mismatch between electrons and gas atoms which prevents elas-
tic electron–atom collisions from eﬃciently thermalizing the electron energy gained
between collisions [5]. Ions, on the other hand, have masses comparable to the gas
atoms and hence would be expected to remain well thermalized even if the energy
gained between collisions became comparable with ∼ kBT . Thus εk for ions should
remain constant and one should be able to reduce the diﬀusion of ions (as 1/√E)
to much lower values than for electrons. The NITPC concept relies critically on this
hypothesis. The purpose of the present work was to test it in detail.

3 Experimental Method

3.1 Apparatus

The NITPC used in this experiment consisted of a drift region attached to a multi-
wire proportional chamber (MWPC) (Figure 1). The drift region was composed of a
solid copper cathode and ﬁeld cage. The ﬁeld cage consisted of 4 loops of 500 µm wire
supported by acrylic posts and connected by a ladder of precision 10 MΩ resistors.
The lateral dimensions of the ﬁeld cage were 15 cm by 20 cm. The MWPC was made
of three wire planes: two grid planes sandwiching an anode plane. The grid and anode
wires were 100 µm and 20 µm gold coated tungsten respectively. Anode wire spacing
was 2 mm, grid wire spacing was also 2 mm but at 45 degrees to the anodes and the
gap was 1.1 cm. The drift distance, from the solid copper cathode to the nearest grid
plane, was 10 cm.

A single negative high voltage supply connected at the cathode was used to set the

drift and MWPC potentials via the ﬁeld cage resistance and a variable resistance
between anode and grid. During operation, the MWPC voltage was kept as high as
possible to yield the greatest gas gain and to insure 100% transparency [4].

The detector was mounted with wire planes vertical in an evacuable chamber. Gas
mixtures were prepared in the chamber by introducing gases one by one through a
manifold. CS2 vapor was evolved from a liquid source by the low pressure in the cham-
ber. All experiments were done at a pressure of 40.0 Torr. The chamber pressure was
measured with a capacitive manometer allowing accurate (0.1 Torr) determination of
pressure and mixture. Before each run, the chamber was evacuated to ∼ 50 mTorr
measured using a Convectron gauge, then backﬁlled with the desired gas mixture and
pressure. A gas ﬁlling would be used for several hours, during which time the pressure
rise was about a percent.

The diﬀusion measurements were made using photoelectrons generated from the solid
copper cathode in the following way. Near the NITPC was a port containing a fused
silica window. A UV ﬂashlamp projected light through a movable 200 µm aperture,
through the silica window, through the grid and anode wire planes, and onto the
cathode. The projected spot on the cathode was ∼ 1.3 mm by ∼ 2 mm measured
using photographic ﬁlm. To maintain the photoelectron yield, the copper cathode was
cleaned with abrasive every three to ﬁve runs. A photodiode viewing the ﬂashlamp
directly provided a start signal for drift time measurements.

The anode wires were connected to Amptek A-250 charge sensitive pre-ampliﬁers
which were housed inside the chamber to reduce noise pickup. The outputs of the
Ampteks were ampliﬁed and shaped by Ortec 855 spectroscopy ampliﬁers. These
signals were digitized and stored on a 20 MHz digital oscilloscope. The scope used
the photodiode signal as a trigger. Waveform averaging was used to improve signal
to noise.

3.2 Measurement

To measure the lateral diﬀusion, the maximum pulse heights on two adjacent wires
were measured as the aperture was moved laterally through 40, 125 µm steps. Pulse
height maxima were measured on waveforms averaged over either 128 or 256 individual
ﬂashlamp shots. Space charge should not aﬀect the results of this experiment. The
number of photoelectrons produced was always less than ∼ 50 per ﬂash. The lateral
diﬀusion of the anions was always greater than 0.7 mm. Since the gain was low, ∼
3000, the size of the avalanche was ∼ 0.05 mm [4]. In those cases where two avalanches
overlapped, the reduction in gain for the second avalanche was less than 1% [4]. In
addition to these theoretical arguments, the gain linearity was tested by conﬁrming
that a ×10 reduction in ﬂash energy resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in
pulse height.

Figure 2 shows a set of measurements, with aperture position on the horizontal axis
and pulse height of the averaged waveforms on the vertical axis. The data for each
peak was ﬁt to a function that allowed deconvolution of the deposited charge from a
known electronic artifact. The distance between the two peaks represented the 2 mm
wire spacing and was used to normalize the lateral measurement. The +’s and ×’s in
Figure 2 are the data for each wire, the line is the ﬁtted function.

The longitudinal diﬀusion was determined by measuring the pulse width in time on
a single wire. To convert this measurement to distance, the drift speed as a function
of drift ﬁeld was determined for each gas mixture. This was done by measuring the
delay time between the light pulse (photoelectron generation) and the peak of the
anode signal. Though the majority of the delay was due to the time ions spent in the
drift ﬁeld, a correction was made for the delay in the MWPC.

In order to minimize variations due to changing chamber conditions, a set of runs at
diﬀerent drift ﬁelds would be done with a given gas mixture. Additionally, all of the
above measurements (lateral and longitudinal diﬀusion and drift velocity) were done
concurrently at a given drift ﬁeld. The delay time and pulse time-width were both
measured at the aperture position corresponding to maximum pulse height for the
wire under test. To reduce the eﬀects of gas aging, a gas mixture was kept for only
one set of runs, and was ﬂushed at the end of the day.

4 Results and Discussion

There are a number of contributions to the measured σ. The main ones are the ﬁnite
spot size, geometry of the chamber, capture distance, and the diﬀusion itself(given
by Equation 1). Since the gap distance in the MWPC was so small and the ﬁeld so
large the diﬀusion there was assumed to be minimal. The various contributions can
be assumed to be uncorrelated and hence to add in quadrature:

σ2
measured = σ2

spot + σ2

geometry + σ2

capture +

where εk in Equation 1 has been characterized in terms of an eﬀective temperature Teﬀ.
The NITPC hypothesis is that Teﬀ will remain constant and close to room temperature
up to very high drift ﬁelds.

For the lateral measurements, the σspot was signiﬁcant while for the longitudinal
measurements it was not due to the short duration of the pulse. In the lateral mea-
surements σgeometry arises from the 2 mm wire spacing and is signiﬁcant. For the
longitudinal measurements σgeometry arises from the diﬀerent pathlengths ions can
take to get to the anode wires and is also signiﬁcant. None of these is a function of
the ﬁeld.

Since σcapture is expected to increase with increasing ﬁeld, a linear relationship between
σ2
measured and 1/E supports the assumption that σcapture is slowly varying or constant.
In that case, Teﬀ can be deduced from the slope. The capture distance can be deduced
from the intercept if the geometry and spot size contributions are known or estimated,
since according to Equation 2

graph, the marks represent the data taken for diﬀerent gas mixtures at a variety of
drift ﬁelds. The triangles are electrons drifted in 50% propane-50%argon for reference.
The points very close to the origin are from experiments where the drift region was
removed and the MWPC used alone with a copper cathode in place of one of the grid
planes. The copper cathode was in approximately the same position relative to the
light source for both the MWPC and NITPC measurements so that the spot size was
constant. The reason that several diﬀusion values appear for each drift ﬁeld is that
two wires were used during the measurement. Since the uncertainty in the Gaussian
ﬁts for the points is much smaller than the marks, the separation between the points
at identical ﬁelds represents a systematic error. This is believed to be due to the
modulation of UV light intensity by the grid and anode wires.

Clearly, the electron data (open triangles in Figure 3) do not obey Equation (2), but
all of the ion data do. The ion data were ﬁt to lines from which Teﬀ and the intercept
were extracted. As can be seen in Table 1, all of the temperatures are consistent with

thermal diﬀusion with perhaps a hint that the lateral diﬀusion is decreasing with
increasing concentration of Ar.

The fact that the high ﬁeld points lie on the general trend of the data is important in
that it shows that electrons are captured even in very large E/p. For the 100% CS2
data the high ﬁeld was 83 V/cmTorr while for the 25% CS2 - 75% Ar data it was
45 V/cmTorr. The intercept data shown in Table 1 and Equation 3 can now be used
to ﬁgure out σcapture. Given the crude nature of our photographic measurement σspot
could not be estimated with any reliability. However, σgeometry = 2mm/√12 which
allows to us to place the upper limits on σcapture shown in Table 1.

4.2 Mobility

Figure 4 shows the drift velocity data for the gas mixtures plotted against the reduced
ﬁeld. The data from each of the gas mixtures was ﬁtted to v = m(E/p) + n(E/p)2.

Table 2 shows the drift velocity coeﬃcients for the diﬀerent gas mixtures. The drift
velocity increases with increasing concentration of argon. This is not unexpected as
an Ar atom is much smaller than a CS2 molecule and therefore the mean free path
of the CS2 ions is much larger, the mean time to collision is increased, thus yielding
a higher drift velocity. In addition the larger mass of the CS2 molecule means that it
will preferentially scatter oﬀ of the Ar atoms in the forward direction.

4.3 Longitudinal Diﬀusion

The longitudinal diﬀusion results are shown in Figure 5 and Table 3. As in the lateral
case, the rms diﬀusion squared is plotted against the inverse of the reduced drift ﬁeld.

As before, the marks represent the data for the various gas mixtures. All of the data
look linear with the obvious exception of the 25%CS2-75%Ar mixture. The linear
datasets were ﬁt to straight lines, giving the Teﬀ values and intercepts shown in Table
3. Notice that in this case the trend is for the temperature to increase with increasing
concentration of Ar.

Unlike the lateral case, σspot is small since photoelectrons are created at the same
time. Also unlike the lateral case, σgeometry is diﬃcult to calculate since it arises from
the diﬀerent path lengths traveled by the ions. It is probably signiﬁcant on the scale

of these measurements (i.e. sub-mm). Therefore we can again only infer an upper
limit on the capture distance, shown in Table 3 for the three measurements which
indicated a constant capture distance.

Given the discussion accompanying Equation 2 the interpretation of the 25%CS2-
75%Ar data is that σcapture is a stronger function of the ﬁeld for this mixture. This
interpretation is bolstered by a measurement of a 10%CS2-90%Ar mixture in which
some of the electrons drifted directly to the anode wires without being captured by
the CS2. This was seen as a “direct” pulse, arriving within several microseconds after
the light pulse instead of the several milliseconds that the ions take.

4.4 Trends

The lateral and longitudinal ion diﬀusion data are generally consistent with diﬀusion
at thermal ion energies, with the exceptions noted above (25%CS2-75%Ar mixtures).

If a further trend exists it is for the lateral diﬀusion to decrease with increasing
Ar concentration while the opposite occurs for the longitudinal diﬀusion. Removing
the systematic error discussed above may help to resolve these trends. Both of these
deviations from Equation 1 can be understood from the fact that CS2 is much heavier
than Ar and therefore tends to preserve its direction of motion after a collision with
Ar, violating one of the assumptions underlying Equation 1.

The σcapture limits are harder to understand. For gas mixtures 50% Ar or less the
lateral and longitudinal data both indicate a constant value with respect to ﬁeld
and gas mixture. One would expect each of these to increase with increasing Ar
concentration but this increase may be masked by the constant terms in Equation 3.
At 75% Ar the lateral and longitudinal data are very diﬀerent. The lateral data seem
to indicate an elevated though ﬁeld independent σcapture while the longitudinal data
clearly indicate a ﬁeld dependent σcapture. At 90% Ar the prompt arrival of electrons
is evidence for a σcapture larger than 10 cm.

5 Conclusion

The lateral and longitudinal diﬀusion of CS2 anions were systematically studied as
a function of ﬁeld and gas mixture. While mostly consistent with a thermal model
certain trends were identiﬁed which need to be explored in more detail. The drift
velocity of CS2 anions and limits on the capture distance for producing those anions
were also measured. These measurements are critical for the operation of the DRIFT
detector and for future uses for NITPCs. The results show that the NITPC concept
will permit detectors such as DRIFT[1] to achieve submillimeter track diﬀusion for
drift distances of the order of a meter, over a useful range of gas mixtures and drift
ﬁelds.

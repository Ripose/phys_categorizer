1 Introduction

Charged particle identiﬁcation is a
crucial component of any modern ex-
periment studying charm and beauty
decays. Ring Imaging Cherenkov
(RICH) detectors oﬀer a very at-
tractive approach. The BTeV RICH
detector has the important functions
of separating π, K, and p, and also
discriminating electrons and muonss
from pions.

The BTeV RICH detector is designed
to separate π/K/p in a momentum
range of 3 to 70 GeV [1]. It is essen-
tial to CP violation studies, provid-

ing separation of speciﬁc ﬁnal states,
such as K +π− from π+π−, and also
providing information on the b ﬂavor
by identifying charged kaons. The
RICH detector also complements
the electromagnetic calorimeter and
the muon detector in lepton iden-
tiﬁcation and thus it increases the
reconstruction eﬃciency in interest-
ing modes like B◦ → J/ψKs sig-
niﬁcantly. We use a freon (C4F8O)
gas radiator to generate Cherenkov
light in the optical frequency range.
The light is focused by mirrors onto
two photon detector arrays. The
two photon detector options that we
considered were hybrid photo-diodes
(HPDs), fabricated at DEP [2], the
Netherlands, and multi-anode pho-
tomultiplier tubes (MaPMTs), fabri-
cated by Hamamatsu [3], Japan. To
separate kaons from protons below
the threshold of gaseous radiator, a
liquid radiator (C5F12) is used and

the light, proximity focused onto the
sides of the vessel, is detected by 3”
PMT arrays.

The design of these devices poses in-
teresting challenges. Diﬀerent trade-
oﬀs between dynamic range and low
intrinsic noise play a role in achiev-
ing optimal performance. Timing re-
quirements are equally important, as
we need to store the time-stamped
event information in local buﬀers
prior to the next collision, assumed
to occur within 132 ns. Finally, al-
though the RICH detector has gen-
erally very low occupancy, some ar-
eas experience high rates and we
required these devices to be able to
sustain the maximum rate, expected
to be on the order of 3 MHz.

Two diﬀerent custom made ASICs
were designed and produced for us
by IDEAS, Norway [4]. The most
extensive tests were performed on
the VA MaPMT circuit, packaged in
the hybrid devices used in the BTeV
RICH beam test studies described in
another contribution to this confer-
ence [5].

2 Conceptual design of
VA MaPMT ASICs

the

The detector segmentation chosen for
our system makes it natural to use
a digital output, as the signal is ex-
pected to be contained within a sin-
gle pixel cell. In addition, this choice
minimizes the number of bits of the
hit information to be transferred. Fi-
nally, as the data needs to be col-
lected in real time, the front end elec-

tronics includes self-triggering capa-
bilities.

The speciﬁcations of the analog pro-
cessor are diﬀerent for the two photon
detectors. The hybrid photon detec-
tors (HPDs) pose the most stringent
requirements on the intrinsic and
common mode noise of the readout
system. The expected charge signal
distribution has a narrow width cen-
tered at about 5,000 e−; thus the
equivalent noise charge (ENC) of
the electronics processor should not
to exceed 500 e−. Moreover, as the
front end electronics incorporates
a built-in discriminator, common
mode noise must be negligible. This
is a signiﬁcant challenge for a device
with distributed readout electronics
and a 20 KV high voltage system.
On the other hand, the MaPMT
tubes feature an average gain in ex-
cess of 106. Even though the single
photon response in this case is rather
broad, the noise requirements can
be relaxed, but high dynamic range
becomes a critical feature.

These devices feature 64 parallel in-
puts and 64 parallel outputs. The
parallel output architecture allows a
prompt extraction of the channel hit
information and the peripheral elec-
tronics can attach a time stamp to
each event. The slow control is im-
plemented as a serial bitstream that
programs the mode of operation of
the ASIC and allows the ﬁne tuning
of the individual channel thresholds
described below.

of each readout channel. The analog
section comprises a semi-Gaussian

preampliﬁer and shaper circuit, fol-
lowed by a high pass ﬁlter that re-
duces the discriminator sensitivity
to long range drifts of the DC work-
ing point of the device. In addition,
a voltage-controlled pole-zero can-
cellation circuit is introduced to op-
timize the rate capabilities.

The input of the digital section is
a discriminator that must operate
eﬀectively at very low thresholds
and it needs to tolerate very high
rates, of the order of several MHz,
to cope with the high occupancy ex-
pected in some areas. The discrim-
inator threshold is set through an
external DAC. In addition, a 4 bit
programmable DAC is built in every
channel to ﬁne tune the threshold
of each individual channel to com-
pensate for diﬀerent DC oﬀsets. The
discriminator output drives a monos-
table circuit that produces an output
current pulse whose width is about
100 ns. Individual digital outputs
can be disabled through a channel
mask set during the initialization
sequence.

There are three modes of operation
for this ASIC: (1) an initialization se-

quence, when a bit pattern sequence
is shifted in the ASIC to program
the desired operating conditions;
(2) a calibration mode, when chan-
nels selected in the initialization se-
quence respond to an input current
pulse sent to the calibration input;
(3) ﬁnally, in normal mode, all the
working channels are activated and
respond to charge signals collected
at their inputs. In addition, a fast-
OR of all the channel hits can be
activated for monitoring or synchro-
nization purposes.

3 The front end ASICs

We started our R& D work with the
ASICs best matched to the HPD
application (VA BTeV).
In order
to operate the discriminator with
threshold levels of the order of about
30 mV, the RC-CR shaper is com-
plemented by an optional gain stage,
which provides an additional 3-fold
ampliﬁcation. When proper shield-
ing and grounding for this device was
achieved, the expected ENC of 500
e− at about 10 pF input capacitance

was achieved and we were able to see
eﬃcient response to our blue LED
single photon source.

Our next project involved the de-
velopment of an ASIC to be used
in conjunction with the R8900-
M16 MaPMT tubes. In this version
(VA MaPMT), we reduced the gain
of the analog front end, but we fo-
cused the design primarily in main-
taining the capability of operating
at very low thresholds. The linear
range of the analog front end ex-
tended to 220 fC, assumed to be
adequate for this application. An
interesting feature added to this de-
sign was an analog channel that can
be used to monitor the analog front
end response either to a calibration
pulse or can be connected to a given
MaPMT pixel. This control channel
proved extremely valuable in under-
standing the performance of this sys-
tem with diﬀerent ASIC biasing con-
ditions and MaPMT high voltages.
The performance of these ASICs will
be the focus of this paper, as they
have been more extensively tested in
a variety of conditions.

The devices described in this paper
are implemented in the 0.8 µm N-well
CMOS AMS process. A new iteration
has been implemented in the 0.35 µm
CMOS process and features an ex-
tended dynamic range for Ma PMT
applications.

The HPD application involved also
a packaging challenge. The 163 pixel

HPDs produced for us by DEP [2]
had the pixel output brought out-
side the HPD vacuum by a pin ar-
ray. This arrangement did not leave
much space for electronics compo-
nents, thus we used a rigid-ﬂex-rigid
technology, shown in Fig. 2. The oc-
tagonal rigid section contains the
VA BTeV ASICs and their biasing
circuits, while the digital back end,
coordinating the data transfer from
front end ASICs to the data acquisi-
tion system, is hosted on the bigger
rectangular section. The two rigid
elements were connected electrically
by a ﬂex circuit embedded in the
two rigid planes, that allowed the
positioning of the digital section at a
right angle with respect to the pho-
ton array plane.

Fig. 3 shows the hybrid hosting the
VA MaPMT ASICs. It is a conven-
tional 6-layer rigid printed circuit
board. The analog inputs are routed
via ﬂat multiconductor cables to the
base board hosting the MaPMT pho-
ton detectors and providing the high
voltage biasing network for their 12
stages.

Both hybrids incorporate level shifter
circuits that translate the current
output from the front end ASICs
into voltage level matching the in-
put requirements of the XILINX

tom made hybrids is about 2,000 e−.

The next tests involved the hybrids
attached to their corresponding pho-
ton detector. The assembly was lo-
cated in a test box where light from a
blue LED was collimated onto a pixel
of the photon detector. The LED
was driven by a narrow pulse genera-
tor that biased the LED at tuneable
very low light level. Both detector-
electronics pairs demonstrated very
good single photon sensitivity.

A set of ten MaPMT hybrids were
used in a gas radiator RICH proto-
type that was taken to the test beam
facility at Fermilab. Data were taken
in two diﬀerent periods, separated by
a few months.

The results of the ﬁrst set of data
are discussed in a separate contribu-
tion to this conference [5]. We were
able to operate at very low thresh-
old throughout the duration of the
data taking without additional noise
hits. In particular, we were able to
run with thresholds of 5 mV, corre-
sponding to a minimum charge signal
of 27,000 e−. With this threshold, the
ratio between the input charge pro-
ducing the onset of saturation and
the minimum input signal to trigger
the discriminator response is 52.

During the ﬁrst run we observed un-
expected cross talk between neigh-
boring channels when the high
voltages exceeded the onset of the
plateau by about 50 to 100 V. Stud-
ies on the test channel with analog
output connected to a MaPMT tube
showed that the major cause of the
cross talk was related to the analog

initialization sequence and to latch
and transfer the data from the front
end to the back end circuit with the
protocols needed by the data acqui-
sition system. The ﬁrmware can be
downloaded in the ﬁrst step of the
initialization sequence and thus we
could adapt this hybrid to diﬀer-
ent data taking modes, and diﬀerent
triggering conﬁgurations.

5 Performance

The initial set of measurements in-
volved input charge scans at diﬀerent
threshold voltages. The shape of the
transition between zero and maxi-
mal eﬃciency was used to estimate
the intrinsic noise of the ASIC un-
der test. From these measurements
we inferred that a typical noise for
the VA BTeV mounted on the hy-
brid described above is about 500
e−, whereas the typical noise for the
VA MaPMT mounted on their cus-

channel going into saturation more
and more frequently as the high volt-
age was increased above plateau. In
order to increase the range of high
voltages with negligible cross talk,
a diﬀerent biasing condition for the
MaPMT was suggested by Hama-
matsu [6]. This new voltage divider
ratio allows for the minimum voltage
between the anode and the ﬁrst dyn-
ode that is needed to achieve full col-
lection eﬃciency at a lower value of
the tube gain. The tradeoﬀ between
gain and crosstalk in the two conﬁg-
urations is shown in Fig. 4. The cross
talk is characterized by the average
number of hits recorded among the 6
closest neighbors to the channel at-
tached to the MaPMT pixel: a value
of 0 means that there is no cross talk,
a value of 6 means that the neigh-
boring channels are registering a hit
whenever the MaPMT pixel is hit.
The new biasing scheme represents
an improvement, but the spread in
gain between diﬀerent tubes suggests
that a more robust option is an in-
crease in the linear dynamic range of
the front end electronics. This option
has been implemented in a new iter-
ation of this ASIC, presently being
characterized.

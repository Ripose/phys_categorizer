Abstract

We have studied the performance of two diﬀerent types of front-end systems for our
gamma camera based on Hamamatsu H8500 (ﬂat-panel 64 channels multi-anode
PSPMT) with a CsI(Tl) scintillator array. The array consists of 64 pixels of 6 × 6 ×
20mm3 which corresponds to the anode pixels of H8500.

One of the system is based on commercial ASIC chips in order to readout every
anode. The others are based on resistive charge divider network between anodes to
reduce readout channels. In both systems, each pixel (6mm) was clearly resolved by
ﬂood ﬁeld irradiation of 137Cs. We also investigated the energy resolution of these
systems and showed the performance of the cascade connection of resistive network
between some PMTs for large area detectors.

1 Introduction

Recently, the concern with the gamma camera based on position sensitive
PMTs for application especially to nuclear medicine has been growing. The
latest developed ﬂat-panel type Hamamatsu H8500 and H9500[1] are promis-
ing devices for such purpose, and several studies have been conducted focusing
on their spatial resolution with both pixellated scintillator array and continu-
ous scintillator slab aiming at PET and SPECT applications[2,3,4].

The merit of such multi-anode ﬂat-panel type PMTs is the small non-active
area when they are arrayed and constitute large area detectors, however, de-
velopments of readout systems for large number of channels are indispensable.

On the other hand, Compton imaging detectors for gamma ray astronomy
or next generation medical imaging has been developed[5,6,7] with gamma
cameras used for the detection of scattered gamma rays. In such cases, not only
the spatial resolution but also the energy resolution is important to reconstruct
the direction of incident gamma rays.

In this paper, we report the spatial resolution and energy resolution of our
gamma camera based on H8500 with two diﬀerent types of front-end systems.
One of the system is based on commercial ASIC chips in order to readout every
anode, the others are based on the resistive charge divider network between
anodes to reduce the readout channels. In order to evaluate the performance,
we coupled a CsI(Tl) scintillator array which ﬁts to the anode pitches of
H8500. This camera is intended for arrayed and covering our micro time pro-
jection chamber (micro-TPC)[5], which constitutes a new Compton imaging
detector[8].

2 The Detector

The Hamamatsu H8500 has a very compact dimension of 52 mm × 52 mm
× 28 mm with 12 stages of metal channel dynodes and a HV divider circuit.
The active photo cathode area is 49 mm×49 mm and is covered by an 8×8
anode array. The typical anode gain is 106 (HV= −1000V) and the typical
anode gain uniformity (the ratio of the maximum gain to the minimum gain)
is about 2.5. Each anode pixel size is 5.8 mm × 5.8 mm and the pitch between
center of the anodes is 6.08 mm.

The size of each CsI(Tl) crystal is 6mm×6mm×20mm. The crystals were
also manufactured by Hamamatsu. Between the crystals, Vikuiti R(cid:13) ESR ﬁlms
(3M) of 65µm are inserted for the optical isolation, so that the pixel of scintil-

2

lator array corresponds to the anode pixel. The array is glued to H8500 using
OKEN6262A optical grease. Fig.1 shows the picture of the array.

3 Readout circuits

3.1 CP80068 system

Fig.2 shows the individual anode readout system (Clear Pulse Co., Ltd. CP80068).
The dimension of CP80068 which is designed for 2 dimensional array of H8500
is 52 mm × 52 mm × 95 mm. It is based on two types of analog ASICs,
VA32HDR14 and TA32CG2 manufactured by IDEAS ASA. VA32HDR14 con-
tains pre-ampliﬁers (input dynamic range∼ ±15pC), shapers (gain= 118mV/pC,
peaking time= 2µs), sample and hold circuits and a multiplexer. TA32CG32
contains fast shapers (peaking time= 75ns) and comparators, which can make
the trigger signals. The multiplexed 64ch data are digitized by a ﬂash ADC
on the CP80068 and sent to the VME sequence module via FPGAs. It takes
164µs to process one event (64 channels).

3.2 Resistive charge division

Fig.3 shows the charge divider network board for H8500. Using this connector
board, the anodes in horizontal rows of H8500 are connected with 100Ω chips
and the number of readout channels are reduced to 16. Each reduced channel is
preampliﬁed (integrating time constant= 66µs), shaped (Clear Pulse CP4026,
shaping time= 2µs) and digitized (CAEN V785). The last dynode output is
used as the trigger signal.

For further reduction of the readout channels, we connected the intervals of
the the both edges of the horizontal chains with 100Ω resisters, thus 4 channels
readout with resistive chain is also tested.

4 Measurements and Results

We are interested in the energy of sub-MeV region[5], accordingly, the CsI(Tl)
array was irradiated by 1 MBq 137Cs source (662keV)at a distance of 30 cm.
For the energy calibration, 22Na (511keV), 133Ba (356keV) and 57Co (122keV)
were also used. An important point to mention here is the dynamic ranges
of the readout circuits. As the input dynamic range of CP80068 is as small

as −15pC, H8500 should be operated with the gain of 104 (HV∼ 600V) to
observe 662keV gamma rays. In the case of resistive charge division circuits,
dynamic ranges of the shaper and the ADC also limit the operation gain of
H8500 to 105 (HV∼ 800V).

4.1 Spatial Resolution

The obtained ﬂood irradiation images of 137Cs are shown in Fig.4. The meth-
ods of the calculation of the position reconstruction are indicated as well.
Image spots represent pixels of the CsI(Tl) array, which indicates that the
intrinsic spatial resolution of H8500 is better than the anode pixel size.

The accidental hit events of multi pixels were rejected in the results of CP80068
system (selection eﬃciency was 79%) and the accidental hit events of more
than two horizontal rows were also rejected in the results of the 16 channels
readout system (selection eﬃciency was 85%). On the other hand, in the 4
channels readout system, there is no way to reject such events, therefore the
peak to valley ratios of the x/y cross section of the ﬂood irradiation image are
the worst.

4.2 Energy Resolution

The obtained energy spectra of the best pixel of each readout system are also
shown in Fig.4. The variations of the energy resolution of 662keV of every
readout system are summarized in Table.1.

The variation of the resolution is mainly due to the variation of the anode
gain. Near the boundary of the detection area, optical leakage (photon col-
lection ineﬃciency) also aﬀects not only the energy resolution but also the
spatial resolution. Fig.5 shows the energy resolutions of measured energy of
all the readout systems. The reason why the energy resolution of the result of
CP80068 system is the worst is its low HV operation.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

It is admitted that individual anode readout is the best way for multi anode
PMTs, however, that needs development of exclusive ASICs with consideration
for the light outputs of scintillator, gain of the PMT, and the dynamic range.
Moreover, in our case, the spatial resolution is not determined by the anode
pixel size but by the crystal pixel size.

Therefore, the advantage of energy resolution of the resistive charge divider
network and discrete modules of readout circuit is encouraging to make larger
area detector. We made cascade resistive connection of 4 H8500s as shown in
Fig.6 for example. The energy resolution is also shown in Fig.5 This connection
is another example of 4 channels/PMT readout and crystal pixel identiﬁcation
is better than that of previous 4 channels readout system.

In conclusion, large area detector of pixel scintillator and H8500 array with
resistive charge division systems have a good performance both energy and
spatial resolutions and have many possibilities in medical and gamma ray
astronomy applications.

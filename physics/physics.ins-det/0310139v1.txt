An interpolating two-dimensional X-ray imaging detector based on a
single photon counter with gas ampliﬁcation by GEM (gas electron
multiplier) structures is presented. The detector system can be used
for time-resolved structure research down to the µs-time domain. The
prototype detector has been tested at the SAXS beamline at ELET-
TRA synchrotron light source with a beam energy of 8 keV to test
its capabilities in the rough beamline environment. The imaging per-
formance is examined with apertures and standard diffraction targets.
Finally, the application in a time-resolved lipid temperature jump ex-
periment is presented.

1. Introduction

Modern synchrotron radiation facilities are able to provide extremely
high photon ﬂuxes with an enormous brilliance. However, the existing
X-ray detectors are often not capable of dealing with the enormous
photon rates produced by insertion devices like wigglers, undulators
or in future by free electron lasers, and are the bottleneck of state of the
art beamlines. To ﬁnd a solution for this mismatch one has to improve
old detector concepts or to introduce new concepts.

Detectors in general can be classiﬁed into two categories: integrat-

ing detectors and single photon counters.

Integrating devices like CCDs (charge coupled devices), image
plates or X-ray ﬁlms, measure intensities by means of a quantity which
changes as a function of X-ray ﬂux, e.g. the number of electron/hole
pairs in semiconductors which are produced by the incoming photons.
After integration of the quantity for some period of time, the infor-
mation is read out. Obviously, the precision of the intensity measure-
ment is directly connected to noise, which has a strong inﬂuence on
the performance of integrating detectors. The noise contributions can
be attributed to noise caused by ﬂuctuations of the measured quan-
tity related to the input (intrinsic noise), to dark noise and to readout
noise. The readout noise increases in proportion to the readout frame
rate, whereby in most CCDs this noise contribution is much larger
than the dark noise. Time-resolution is thus competing with intensity
precision; generally, the time-resolution is limited to keep the readout
noise contribution relatively small. At high photon rates the inﬂuence
of dark noise and readout noise becomes small and the performance
of integrating systems is getting more favourable. However, at some
value of input ﬂux the integrator saturates and can not add up more
until the content is reset. The dynamic range of integrating devices,
which is typically 104–105, is thus limited by dark noise and satura-
tion level. The detective quantum efﬁciency (DQE), which is generally

out/SNR2

deﬁned as the square of the ratio of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at
the output and the input of the detector DQE = SNR2
in, is a
quantitative measure of the noise added to the image by the detection
process. Thereby, high DQE values are equivalent to low noise addi-
tions. The DQE of integrating systems rises as a function of the photon
rate ﬁnally reaching a maximum, which is equivalent to the quantum
efﬁciency (QE), if intrinsic noise is neglected (Fig. 1). At small pho-
ton rates the DQE drops due to the increasing inﬂuence of the noise.
Integrating devices, especially solid state detectors, are often used in
high rate applications or in crystallography where the production of
parallax at large diffraction angles restricts the use of gaseous detec-
tors.

Counting detectors like MWPCs (multi wire proportional cham-
bers) or MSGCs (micro strip gas chambers) are sensitive to single
photons – deciding whether there is an event or not – and they accu-
mulate the number of measured photons. In contrast to integrating de-
vices they are not sensitive to noise contributions, described above, as
long as this noise level is below the threshold, triggering the counter.
Therefore, the DQE at small photon rates is equal to the QE (Fig. 1).
However, one single event implies a dead time caused by the length of
the produced detector signal, itself, and the electronic processing, e.g.
the readout. These dead time effects at higher rates lead to a drop of the
DQE. The dynamic range of photon counting devices is limited down-
wards by the number of counts due to false triggers (noise triggers)
and upwards by the (inverse) dead time, typically reaching values of
up to 106. To prevent the detector from too high photon rates one has
to attenuate the primary beam, and thus the full power of modern syn-
chrotrons is wasted. Due to the low noise level, the high dynamic range
and the good time-resolution, which can be approximately in the order
of magnitude of the dead time or even better, single photon counting
detectors, e.g. one-dimensional delay-line detectors (Gabriel, 1977),
are often used for example in SAXS imaging, where only small paral-
lax is obtained due to the small diffraction angles.

gle photon counters with dead times of 1 ms and 1 µs, respectively, in simple
approximations.

However, the unique detector for every application is not existent
and compromises have to be found, optimising the detector for the
particular application. Although many efforts have been started to in-
crease the readout speed of integrating CCD cameras, e.g. (Tipnis

et al., 2002), the time-resolution is still limited to about 1 ms . De-
spite their good spatial resolution and their large number of pixels
CCDs also suffer from the limited intensity precision of roughly 1 %
(Kocsis, 2001) and the limited dynamic range. In contrast to that, sin-
gle photon counters can still not deal with the enormous rates offered
by synchrotron facilities of the third or fourth generation. There are
new ideas to ﬁnd solutions to this drawback e.g. with semiconduct-
ing pixel array detectors (Datte et al., 1999; Rossi et al., 1999; Renzi
et al., 2002). With the introduction of micro pattern gaseous de-
vices like MSGCs (Oed, 1988) or GEMs (gas electron multipliers)
(Sauli, 1997) several new approaches have been carried out building
faster gaseous detectors, e.g. the RAPID system (Lewis, 1994; Lewis
et al., 1997; Lewis et al., 2000) or a GEM pixel detector (Bellazzini
et al., 2001), which replace the old detector era of MWPCs. An
overview of micro pattern gaseous detectors can be found for example
in (Sauli & Sharma, 1999).

The two-dimensional single photon counting gaseous detector for
X-rays in the energy range of 5–15 keV, described in this publication,
represents a concept which is very ﬂexible and can therefore easily be
adapted to special requirements.

2. Detector setup
In this section we brieﬂy describe the working principle and the
setup of the detector. Detailed information about the detector can be
found elsewhere (Besch et al., 1997; Sarvestani et al., 1998a; Wag-
ner et al., 2003; Orthen et al., 2003a). A review of a previous, sim-
ilar detector with smaller sensitive detection area and a less sophis-
ticated position reconstruction, with a different gas gain mechanism
and with slower electronics and readout has also been published ear-
lier (Sarvestani et al., 1999a).

Fig. 2 shows a schematic cross-section of the detector. The X-
ray photons enter the detector through the carbon ﬁbre entrance win-
dow and the subjacent 50 µm thick mylar foil clad with a few mi-

crometer thick carbon layer at the bottom side serving as drift cath-
ode. Inside the conversion region between the drift cathode and the
(ﬁrst) gas gain structure (gap of about 25 mm, which is a compro-
mise between a good photo effect efﬁciency and moderate parallax)
one single photon produces a few hundred primary electrons in the
gas volume, which is typically ﬁlled with Xe/CO2 (90/10). Since this
charge amount is too small to be detected additional ampliﬁcation
is necessary. For that purpose micro pattern devices like MicroCAT
(Sarvestani et al., 1998b) or GEM (Sauli, 1997) have been inten-
sively tested (Sarvestani et al., 1999b; Orthen et al., 2002; Orthen
et al., 2003b; Orthen et al., 2003a). The MicroCAT has many ad-
vantageous like stable gas gaining at high rates, time stability or an
enormous robustness. Nevertheless, we were not successful in ﬁnding
a suitable spacer concept which should guarantee a constant distance
to the subjacent readout anode. Therefore we refrained from using this
device. For the GEM an external spacer concept is not necessary and,
despite some disadvantages like rate- and time-dependent gas gaining
which are discussed in Sec. 3., we have decided to use a constellation
of three consecutive GEM stages. Each GEM foil produces a gas gain
of about 10–100, if the voltage difference on both copper layers of
the GEM amounts to about 300–600 V depending on gas mixture and
pressure. In the very high electric ﬁelds within the GEM holes (typ.
80 kV/cm) an avalanche process takes place, exponentially multiply-
ing the initial charge. The total gas gain of a triple-GEM constellation
can easily exceed 104 and stable operation in xenon gas mixtures up
to 2 bar are possible. Another advantage of the GEM is its production
of very short signals with lengths in the order of a few 10 ns. In com-
parison the MicroCAT’s signals are at least one order of magnitude
longer. The signal length, itself, is the main dead time contribution of
the detector and should therefore be kept as short as possible. Since
the GEM technology is well sophisticated and intensively tested also
large area GEMs can be built (Bachmann et al., 2000) and thus large
sensitive areas are feasible.

Figure 2
Schematic cross-section of the detector setup. The conversion gap between drift cathode and uppermost (ﬁrst) GEM amounts to about 25 mm. The distance between
56 mm2,
the individual GEMs amounts to 2 mm and between the undermost (third) GEM and the readout structure to 1 mm. The sensitive area has a size of 56
9 cells, whereby the outermost cells are dummy cells). The drift cathode is typically supplied
subdivided into 7
with a voltage of
1 kV/cm. The readout structure is at ground
potential. The electric ﬁeld between the individual GEMs is set to 2.5 kV/cm and between the undermost GEM and readout structure to 3 kV/cm. On the right hand
side a scanning electron microscopic view and a schematic vertical cut through the GEM with typical dimensions are shown. The GEM consists of a perforated
50 µm thick Kapton substrate, covered with 5 µm copper on each side. The optical transparency of the GEM amounts to 12 %.

After multiplication the charge cluster hits the readout anode,
which is realised by an interpolating resistive structure, where the spa-
tial information of the event is determined in two dimensions (Besch
et al., 1997). The sensitive area of the readout structure (Fig. 3) is
divided into 7 × 7 square cells. Each cell, which has an edge length
of g = 8 mm and a surface resistance of 100 kW
/(cid:3), is surrounded by
better conducting borders with a width of about 200 µm and a sur-
/(cid:3). The resistive material is printed onto an
face resistivity of 1 kW
Al2O3-ceramics or a FR4-PCB medium. The charge ﬂows to the read-
out nodes at the corners of the cells, which are connected by small
through connections to the backside of the anode. By means of lin-
ear reconstruction algorithms, e.g. using only the collected charges
Qi at the four readout nodes of one cell (4-node algorithm), the event
position can be calculated within the cell:

The y-coordinate is calculated analogically. For a proper reconstruc-
tion using combinations of several linear algorithms always 9 nodes
should be read out. Due to this interpolating concept the cells can be
subdivided into Virtual Pixels (ViP) and a large sensitive area can be
covered, simultaneously reaching a spatial resolution of the order of
100 µm (fwhm) which is nearly two orders of magnitude better than
the size of a cell (this spatial resolution can only be obtained in combi-
nation with adequate electronics and a gas gain of about 104 because
the spatial resolution is directly proportional to ∝ SNR−1).

card, controlling the data latch to the PC. This concept enables a par-
allel and asynchronous readout of the nine nodes of interest, carrying
the most important information of one event. A big advantage of this
concept is also the modularity: To build a larger detector with more
readout channels the electronic system has to be replicated n-times to
reach the desired dimension. The master cards of these sub-systems
have to be connected to an overall-master. Thereby, it should be pos-
sible to extend the detector by scaling the sensitive area and the global
rate capability at the same time without loss of spatial resolution and
local rate capability.

Together with the signal information a time stamp in terms of a µs-
or ns-counter is digitally recorded. The counter can externally be reset.
Additionally, an external signal (e.g. a linear ramp) can be digitised
by the ADC at the master-card. The time information can be used to
slice the data after the measurement has been ﬁnished.

The digitised data from the ADC-cards is stored into a FIFO inside
the Xilinx on the master card, which is connected via optocouplers
to a PC using a standard 32 bit PCI-interface. Currently, the transfer
in DMA-mode can latch data with a speed of 12 MB/s into the mem-
ory of the PC. By using an alternative PCI-card the transfer speed can
even be increased to 80 MB/s. A dedicated software package, written
in Visual C++, processes data online, so that the user is directly able to
evaluate the current measurements. The raw data as well as the already
processed image histogram can be stored to hard disk. Each event oc-
cupies 25 bytes in the raw data ﬁle. Time-slicing can be applied using
the information stored in the raw data ﬁles.

3. Detector performance

In the following subsections we investigate the general performance
of the triple-GEM ViP detector excluding the imaging performance,
which is discussed in Section 4.

3.1. Gas gain

A single GEM is able to produce stable gas gain of 101–103. By
adding several GEM stages the overall gain can be increased, reach-
ing a total gain of 103–105 for a triple-GEM constellation, depending
on gas mixture and pressure up to about 3 bar (Orthen et al., 2003a).
Higher pressure operation with high-Z gases like xenon is not advis-
able due to an unstable gain process (high sparking probability). The
use of the triple-GEM for hard X-ray detection is therefore rather lim-
ited.

The gain homogeneity over the total area of the triple-GEM con-
stellation in a homogeneous illumination is much superior to Micro-
CAT detectors because no external spacer concept is needed due to
the intrinsic constant thickness of the Kapton foil and the width of the
multiplication gap, respectively.

Disadvantageous is the fact that the GEM can easily be destroyed
by too heavy sparks. The detector should always be operated in safe
voltage and gas gain ranges, if possible. Also the time- and rate-
stability of the multiplication factor using the GEM is bad due to
charging of the insulating Kapton medium. We have measured that
the gain drops as a function of illumination time and photon rate. As
an example, Fig. 4 shows the measured relative gain distribution as a
function of the position in the detector during the measurement of a
silver behenate diffraction target with high local rates. In counting de-
tectors, like the detector presented here, the rate- and time-dependence
of the gas gain does not bother as long as the signals do not drop under
the trigger threshold. However, an energy selectivity can not be car-
ried out for inhomogeneous images and due to the decreasing signal-
to-noise ratio also the spatial resolution drops in highly illuminated
areas. This has to be compensated by a very high overall gas gain

Figure 3
Schematic of one cell of the PCB readout structure. Around the charge im-
pact point the electric potential increases displayed by the white colour and the
electric ﬁeld forces the charge to move towards the readout nodes at the cell
corners.

Each read out charge is ampliﬁed by a charge sensitive ampliﬁer
and digitized by a 12 bit ADC (analog to digital converter) sampling
with a frequency of 66 MHz. Four ADC channels corresponding to
one detector cell are placed together at one ADC-card, where they
are connected to one complex logic device (Xilinx FPGA) (Nurdan
et al., 2003). Via point to point links the sixteen ADC-cards, contain-
ing all 64 channels, can communicate with their direct neighbours,
while the data/control bus supports the communication with a master

(which is easily possible with the triple-GEM conﬁguration) but which
requires a high dynamic range of analogue and digital electronics. As
a preampliﬁcation stage in integrating systems (Menk et al., 1999) the
GEM can not be introduced. To stop the charging of the Kapton and
thus to keep the gas gain rate- and time-independent a coating of the
GEM with amorphous carbon is proposed (Beirle et al., 1999). The
energy resolution of the triple-GEM then is expected to be in the order
of 20 % at 8 keV, which can also be obtained with standard (uncoated)
GEMs in homogeneous illumination or single photon spots with con-
stant X-ray ﬂux after an equilibrium state has been reached.

Figure 4
Relative gain in the region of the inner 5
5 cells of the sensitive area during
the measurement of a silver behenate diffraction target. In the high rate area
(within the diffraction ring) the photon ﬂux is about 50 times higher than in the
background; the gain drops roughly by a factor of 2 (dark colours).

3.2. High rate capability

In counting detectors one has to make a compromise between high
rate capability and spatial resolution. In general a detector can be op-
timised to deal with high rates by a very fast shaping of the analogue
signals, at the same time, however, losing spatial resolution due to too
little collected charge and thus a too small SNR. The most elegant way
to avoid these problems is to produce very short intrinsic detector sig-
nals, which is one big advantage of micro pattern devices in contrast
to MWPCs. The GEM features a very fast signal shape at the an-
ode, which is induced only by electrons. The about 103-times slower
ions do not make any contribution to the signal, which is however the
case for other micro pattern devices like MicroCAT or micromegas
(Giomataris et al., 1996). In our detector setup the raw anode signals
have a gaussian shape with a mean length of 20–100 ns (fwhm) for
Ar/CO2 (90/10) at standard pressure and Xe/CO2 (90/10) at a pres-
sure of 3 bar, respectively (Orthen et al., 2003a). Thereby, the signal
length is mainly determined by a temporal smearing due to longitu-
dinal electron diffusion in the conversion gap. The relatively high
resistance and capacitance of the sensitive area leads to an integrat-
ing RC-element-like behaviour of the readout structure, resulting in a
temporal broadening of the input signal (cf. Fig. 5). After the signal
information has crossed the cell from the point of impact towards the
readout nodes, the total signal width has increased.

Diffusion simulation result (Wagner et al., 2002) of the δ-response of the read-
out structure for three different charge impact positions (cf. Fig. 3 for node
denotation): a) symmetrically between node 0 and 1 on the low resistivity cell
border; b) cell centre; c) close to node 2. The displayed currents are read out at
node 1. Since the absolute currents values obtained at impact positions b) and
c) are very small compared to a) we scaled the plotted functions arbitrarily to
increase the diagram’s clearness.

Due to the interpolating character of the image reconstruction we
have to make sure, that the signals do not pile up in a certain area. Af-
fected by this constraint is an area of nearly 3 × 3 cells containing the
cell with the charge impact as the central area (Fig. 6). Thereby, the
dead area is always measured in cell units, which means that decreas-
ing the cell size leads to a higher local rate acceptance per unit area.
With a typical preampliﬁed signal with a length of 100 ns the detector
accepts local rates up to 1 MHz per 3 × 3 cells with 10 % dead time
losses. One is free to adapt the cell size to be able to deal with the de-
sired photon rates. Increasing the cell size is equivalent with a larger
sensitive area and lower rate capability per unit area. Decreasing the
cell size behaves vice versa. However, the cell size is limited up-
wards by the obtained spatial resolution (which is nearly proportional
to the cell size) and downwards by the readout speed of the electron-
ics which can not be exceeded. Moreover, if the cell size is chosen too
small (g < 1 mm), the advantage of the interpolating readout system
vanishes; in this case, a pure pixel device is much more advantageous
and easier to handle. By means of a complex signal recognition dou-
ble events may potentially be processed properly in future. Yet, this
feature has not been realised.

Another rather critical point in gaseous avalanche detectors is the
inﬂuence of space charge produced by the multiplication process –
mainly of the slowly drifting ions –, causing spatial reconstruction
distortions, because the electrons, drifting from the conversion gap to-
wards the gain regions, are attracted by the ion space charge. So it
comes that a weak spot close to a hot spot is attracted. A big advan-
tage of micro pattern devices compared to e.g. MWPCs is the fact,
that the amount of ions, drifting back from the multiplication regions
to the drift cathode, is relatively small. In case of the triple-GEM the
ion feedback is in the range of < 10 % (Breskin et al., 2002; Bondar
et al., 2003). With special care in choosing the GEM type and adjust-
ing the ﬁelds the ion feedback can be suppressed to less than 3 % at a
gain of 104.

3.3. Noise level and intensity precision

The noise level of the triple-GEM detector is around a few counts
per seconds over all the sensitive area, as typical for counting de-
tectors. For a 280 × 280 virtual pixel interpolation, correspond-
ing to a pixel size of 200 × 200 µm2, the noise level is far below
10−4 cts · s−1 · pixel−1. Intensity precision is thus, as expected, only
Poisson-limited and can be better than 1 ‰.

3.4. Analogue Electronics

The charge integrating preampliﬁers with subsequent shaping, cur-
rently in use, have a shaping time of 300 ns. They have not been op-
timised for this application, but were rather built for a MWPC which
produces signals with long ion tails. We aim at using a linear trans-
impedance preampliﬁer. The charge collection by current integration
can be carried out digitally afterwards in the FPGA. One prototype
channel, which has already been tested, responds to a δ-like input
with a gaussian signal shape with a width of about σfwhm = 15 ns
due to bandwidth limitations.

3.5. Preprocessing and data readout

The data readout crucially inﬂuences the dead time behaviour of
the overall system. In the previous electronics (Stiehler et al., 1998)
the data transfer used to be the bottleneck of the readout, which lim-
ited the readout speed dramatically: For each event all 64 channels
with 16 signal points `a 8 bit have been transferred to the PC. Every
event implied additionally an electronic dead time of about 10 µs. The
synchronous readout was triggered by an externally generated signal
(“global trigger”) which was created by the discriminated signal from
the bottom side of the lowermost GEM (or from the MicroCAT, re-
spectively).

The newly developed ADC system offers the capability of prepro-
cessing before the data is latched to the PC. The processing is per-
formed by Xilinx FPGA (ﬁeld programmable array) devices which
are freely programmable using a hardware description language like
VHDL. The new system is, for example, able to integrate the current
signal, to ﬁnd the signal peak (i.e. Ref. (Conka-Nurdan et al., 2003))
and to locate the node with the maximum signal and the additional 8
surrounding nodes autonomously. Furthermore, it can work in a self-
triggering mode, i.e. a trigger is generated by a signal recognition unit.
This trigger signal needs not serve as a global but rather as a “local”

trigger which means that only the region of interest is triggered for
readout while the neighbouring channels (at least two cells away) are
not read out and thus work in a normal fashion. During the readout of
the 9 nodes of interest these ADC channels are continuously sampling
new data, so that no additional dead time occurs. With the ﬁnal ver-
sion of the local trigger concept the electronics should be able to work
with a dead time smaller than the signal widths (Martoiu et al., 2003).
Unfortunately, the measurements, described in this publication,
could only be carried out with a “slim” version, which means that
the Xilinx devices were programmed with a less complex test mode
VHDL programme.
It is still based on the global trigger which is
distributed to the whole system by one dedicated ADC-channel, that
originally used to digitise data at the corner of the sensitive area (cf.
black dead area in the lower right corner of Fig. 11). After the trigger
has been received by the other ADC-cards the peak sampling point in
a deﬁned time window of each channel is transmitted to the master
card that decides which 9 nodes are sent to the PC. The dead time of
this procedure amounts to 4 µs. The local trigger programming is cur-
rently under development, and a prototype version has already been
tested successfully.

3.6. Time-resolution

With the triple-GEM detector and the new digital (and analogue)
electronics it seems sensibly feasible to reach continuous time-
resolutions in the 100 ns-range; thereby, the time-resolution is limited
by the width of the conversion gap dgap: Incoming photons may con-
vert into electrons by photo effect everywhere in this gap (actually
more photons convert directly behind the entrance window compared
to positions directly above the GEM due to the exponential absorp-
tion law). By this physical process the time-resolution is limited by
the maximum electron drift time τmax = dgap/ve in the conversion gap.
Typical values for the electron drift velocity are ve = 3–4 cm/µs in
xenon-based gas mixtures at standard pressure (Becker et al., 1999).
This means, that the time-resolution is limited to about 800 ns for a
25 mm conversion gap. The drift gap can be chosen smaller, at the
same time losing quantum efﬁciency. Increasing gas pressure to in-
crease efﬁciency will decrease drift velocity and hence increase the
drift time. Maybe the addition of some very fast gases like CF4
to the xenon mixture can increase the electron drift velocity (Va’vra
et al., 1993). The limitation due to this phenomenon is actually sim-

ilar in all gaseous devices where a larger conversion gap is needed to
have sufﬁcient quantum efﬁciency. Incidentally, the timing structure
of the synchrotron beam caused by the individual electron bunches in
the storage ring is also lost due to the relatively slow electron drift in
the conversion gap; for ELETTRA or ESRF the minimum time differ-
ence between two bunches (with uniform bunch pattern) amounts to
about 2 ns.

4. Imaging performance

The images, shown in the next subsections, have been recorded with
two different readout structures based either on a ceramic or on a PCB-
substrate. Both substrates have advantages and disadvantages:

The AlO2-ceramic medium is very planar and therefore well suited
for operation with a MicroCAT gas gain structure. However, it suf-
fers from a high dielectric constant (ǫ = 9.9 @ 1 MHz) leading to
a large capacitance of the resistive area and therefore to a large sig-
nal broadening at the readout structure (cf. Sec. 3.2.). Furthermore,
the through-contacts have a relatively large diameter of 300–400 µm,
leading to image distortions in the surrounding area of the nodes.

The PCB is not planar and hence not suited in combination with the
MicroCAT. However, the advantages outbalance the ceramics due to
the lower dielectric constant (ǫ = 4.6 @ 1 MHz), the possibility to use
micro-vias at the readout nodes with a diameter of only 200 µm and
the very ﬂexible multi-layer conﬁguration.

4.1. Flatﬁeld response

Due to a slightly non-linear behaviour of the ViP readout structure
it is not possible to reconstruct distortion-free images with only one
linear algorithm. Fig. 7 a) shows the response of a detector with a
PCB-readout structure to a uniform illumination reconstructed with
the 4-node algorithm (cf. Eq. 1). A 55Fe-source has been used for
illumination (Eγ = 5.9 keV). The detector has been operated with
an Ar/CO2 (90/10) gas ﬁlling at standard pressure. The depletion at
the cell border shows the non-linear charge division behaviour. By
using a more complex linear 4/6/3-node algorithm these kind of dis-
tortions do not occur anymore (Fig. 7 b)). However, the population
density is still not ﬂat as it should be (i.e. the nodes are overpopulated)
due to systematic effects like cross talk, electronic gain variations1 –
i.e. of the preampliﬁer –, variations of the resistance of the sensitive
area or variations of the width of the low resistivity cell borders. To
further improve the image one can apply a non-linear correction (two-
dimensional variable transformation), resulting in an image shown in
Fig. 7 c). A detailed investigation of the image reconstruction with the
resistive ViP concept can be found elsewhere (Wagner et al., 2003).

All further images have been reconstructed with the linear 4/6/3-
node algorithm with subsequent non-linear correction at the nodes and
at the cell borders.

4.2. Aperture image

4.2.1. Hole grid collimator The image of a hole grid collimator con-
sisting of a stainless steel aperture with 0.5 mm holes at a grid distance
of 8 mm is depicted in Fig. 8. It becomes obvious, that close to the
border of the detector the image is slightly distorted. These distortions
are mainly caused by a slightly inhomogeneous drift ﬁeld and can be
avoided by the usage of an additional electrode frame which is ﬁxed
upon the ceramic frame, holding the uppermost GEM. Distortions due
to ﬁeld inhomogeneities can also be caused by inhomogeneous elec-
tric ﬁelds between the individual GEMs (transfer ﬁeld) and between
undermost GEM and readout structure (induction ﬁeld). It is very im-
portant that the distance between the individual electrodes is as con-
stant as possible. Especially the transfer and induction ﬁelds are very
sensitive to these variations due to the small distance of 1–2 mm of
the particular electrodes. Transfer and induction ﬁeld variations are
also a possible reason for global gas gain variations because the effec-
tive gas gain is determined by the electron transfer through the GEM

1 The inﬂuence of gas gain variations on the event position are far below the spatial resolution (Orthen, 2000).

4.2.2. SAXS collimator Fig. 9 shows the image of a laser cut 1 mm
thick stainless steel aperture containing “SAXS 2D” letters and ﬁve
holes with increasing hole diameters. The image has been recorded
with a PCB-readout structure using photons of an energy of 6.4 keV
(ﬂuorescence of a Fe-target in a 8 keV synchrotron beam). The de-
tector was ﬁlled with a Xe/CO2 (90/10) gas mixture at a pressure of
1.3 bar. We performed an additional ﬂatﬁeld correction with a ﬂatﬁeld
image recorded in our laboratory one week after the aperture measure-
ment with a different gas ﬁlling and a different X-ray source. Since
this ﬂatﬁeld image is different from one which we would have ob-
tained at the beamline directly after the aperture measurement (with
identical detector parameters), the corrected image still shows up
some artifacts like still visible area around the readout nodes (marked
with white circles) which should have been suppressed by the correc-
tion with a proper ﬂatﬁeld image.

The comparison to a photographic image of the aperture (right hand
side image in Fig. 9) shows a very good accordance. Only the middle
part of the second “S” (dotted circle) looks slightly distorted; at this
readout channel the preampliﬁer was not working fully correctly. The
reproduction of the small holes shows a good agreement, too.

Figure 9
Image of the “SAXS” aperture recorded with the ViP detector (left hand side) and photograph taken with a standard digital camera against the sunlight (right hand

is small. The illuminated spots at the bottom correspond to holes in the aperture with diameters of 280, 380, 480, 580 and 680 µm. The aperture is slightly tilted by
an angle of about 0.6◦, which can be recognised for example by the vertical pixel jump at the bottom of the “2” (dashed-dotted ellipse). The sizes of both depicted
images amount to 4.4

Using the image of the smallest hole of the SAXS aperture with
a diameter of 280 µm (the intensity proﬁle of the spot with a virtual
pixel size of 100 × 100 µm2 is shown in Fig. 10), we have deter-
mined the width of the point spread function (psf) to be in the order of
σpsf ≈ 120 µm (fwhm).

4.3. Diffraction measurement

All diffraction patterns, presented in the following sections, have
been recorded at the Austrian SAXS beamline (Amenitsch et al.,
1998; Bernstorff et al., 1998) at the synchrotron ELETTRA/Trieste.

4.3.1. Rat tail tendon collagen Fig. 11 shows the diffraction pattern
of a rat tail tendon with a d-spacing of about 650 ˚A which was used for
the detector calibration/alignment for the time-resolved SAXS mea-
surements described in Sec. 5. The image has been recorded with a
ceramic readout structure and a beam energy of 8 keV; the remaining
detector parameters were the same as described in Sec. 4.2.2.

The vertical intensity proﬁle is shown in Fig. 12. Even the 14th and

15th diffraction order are slightly visible.

small angle region, silver behenate (CH3(CH2)20–COOAg) with a

5. Time-resolved SAXS

The high X-ray photon ﬂux available at synchrotron light sources
opens up the possibility of fast time-resolved studies. Of spe-
cial interest are for example dynamical processes in material sci-
ence (Clery, 1997) like phase transitions, polymerisation or defor-

mations under stress.
example muscle contraction (Squire et al., 1991; Wakabayashi &
Amemiya, 1991; Holmes & Geeves, 2000; Piazzesi et al., 2002) or
lipid phase transitions (Rapp, 1991; Seddon & Templer, 1995) come
into the focus of interest.

Several mechanical test measurements in our laboratory have been
carried out with a X-ray tube showing the capability of the detector
system to resolve very fast processes up to the µs-regime (Sarvestani
et al., 2001). Since a slower electronic system has been used for these
measurements the processes had to be periodically repeated a few hun-
dred or even a few thousand times to collect sufﬁcient statistics. The
repetition is no problem at radiation stable materials which have been
used for these measurements. However, the number of repetitions in
e.g. biological X-ray diffraction measurements is limited due to severe
radiation damage of the sample.

Here, we present a time-resolved temperature jump experiment
of a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) lipid.
The sample preparation is described elsewhere (Rappolt et al., 2003).
The sample has been placed inside a thin-wallet quartz capillary with
a diameter of 1 mm. The T -jump has been induced by a light ﬂash
from a solid state laser at a wavelength of 1540 nm with erbium in
glass as the active laser medium (Rapp & Goody, 1991). We have re-
peated the experiment about ten times, which was sufﬁcient due to the
high scattering power of the sample and since we were not interested
in intensity resolution but rather in the change of the d-spacing in the
lipid due to the rapid temperature increase, manifested by a spatial
displacement of the diffraction ring.

at the intersection point of the infrared laser beam and the monochro-
matic 8 keV X-ray beam which is emitted from a wiggler insertion
device at the synchrotron acceleration ring. A water-based cooling
system combined with a heater (KHR, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) as-
sured a constant starting temperature of the sample which can be cho-
sen within a temperature range of 0–150 ◦C. The sample temperature
has been measured with a platinum resistor PT-100. Before the T -
jump the sample was equilibrated for a period of about 10 min for a
given temperature. The ﬂash-like laser pulse with a length of 2 ms and
a measured pulse energy of 0.64 J appears about 1 ms after the trigger
pulse and heats the sample very rapidly by approximately 5 K. We
have collected data for a period of 10–30 s starting about 1 s before
the triggering of the laser pulse.

After the measurement the data has been cut into ﬁne time slices
(e.g. 3 ms-slices for 0 ≤ t ≤ 60 ms, where t denotes the time after the
laser trigger). For the data analysis we have carried out a radial inte-
gration of the two-dimensional intensity histogram (the rat tail tendon
image was used for the determination of the beam centre at the detec-
tor) and a subsequent lorentzian maximum-likelihood ﬁt to the peak.
The result of the reconstructed lipid d-spacing as a function of time
after the laser trigger of one recorded T -jump is shown in Fig. 15. It
is clearly visible that the temperature increase of the lipid features a
decrease in d-spacing. More detailed results concerning the T -jump
of the POPE lipid will be published later.

after the laser trigger show that the maximum change in d-spacing (and hence
the maximum temperature change) occurs immediately after the end of the
laser pulse (i.e. 3–30 ms).

6. Conclusion

The GEM-based ViP photon counting prototype detector represents a
powerful tool for µs- or ms-time-resolved X-ray imaging applications.
The most important parameters are summarised in Tab. 1, where also a
possible future version of the detector and a comparison to the RAPID
detector is listed. Large sensitive detection areas in combination with
spatial resolution in the order of 100 µm are feasible with the virtual
pixel readout concept, at the same time saving expenses due to an
enormous reduction of electronic channels. Since the GEM produces
short signals the detector can deal with high local rates without signal
pile-up; local rates of > 1 MHz with less than 10 % dead time losses

are easily possible. However, the interpolating reconstruction must re-
ject multiple events in an area of approximately 3 × 3 cells around the
position of the photon impact. This problem could possibly be over-
come in future by a more complex signal processing. It is expected,
that the electronic local trigger concept – enabling an asynchronous
readout – will be capable of dealing with very high rates so that the
global rate capability is proportional to the number of cells; neverthe-
less, this has still to be tested. The ViP detector offers a high quantum
efﬁciency and a relatively good parallax suppression even for higher
photon energies because high pressure operation up to at least 3 bar
is possible. The overall time resolution, which is mainly determined
by the electron drift time in the conversion gap, is in the order of a
few 100 ns. Amorphous carbon coating of the GEMs should suppress

charging of the Kapton and the gas gain should be rate- and time-
independent, and also the energy resolution is expected to be around
20 % at 8 keV. A further optimisation of the GEM could possibly
provide an ion feedback < 1 % to reduce the ion space charge in the
conversion gap even more.

When the number of electronic channels increases above a certain
limit, the whole reconstruction work should be implemented in the
FPGA logic devices on the system master-card(s) by making use of
the newest generation of FPGAs featuring fast multiplier/divider units.
By only transmitting the (already time-sliced) histograms instead of
the raw data the data transfer to the PC will be compressed by several
orders of magnitude.

Pixel vertex detectors are THE instrument of choice for the tracking of charged particles close to the interaction point
at the LHC. Hybrid pixel detectors, in which sensor and read-out IC are separate entities, constitute the present
state of the art in detector technology. Three of the LHC detectors use vertex detectors based on this technology.
A development period of almost 10 years has resulted in pixel detector modules which can stand the extreme rate
and timing requirements as well as the very harsh radiation environment at the LHC for its full life time and without
severe compromises in performance. This lecture reviews the physics and technology of pixel detectors for tracking
and vertexing at the LHC.

1. Introduction

1.1. From gas-ﬁlled wire chambers to pixel vertex detectors

Advances in particle tracking have always lead to breakthroughs in experimental methods and hence to a new
quality of experiments. A prominent example of this statement is the Nobel-awarded invention of the multi-wire
proportional chamber by G. Charpak in 1968 [1, 2], which for the ﬁrst time allowed the electronic detection of particle
tracks to an accuracy in the order of a mm and below. Later (
1975) spatial resolutions in the order of 100 µm
were obtained with drift chambers. These detectors typically had a readout density of 0.05 channels/cm2. So called
vertex drift chambers (see e.g. [3]) improved the resolution of such chambers down to about 50 µm with a readout
density of 0.1 channels/cm2. These devices enabled the detection of decay vertices, and hence measurements of the
life times of long lived (

ps) particles.

∼

Silicon micro strip detectors were developed in the early eighties [4]. With this new type of detectors spatial
resolutions in the order of 10 µm became accessible for the ﬁrst time. The identiﬁcation of secondary vertices and
and hence of particle life times became precision measurements. These devices had a channel density of the order of
100 channels/cm2.

∼

Pixel detectors [5], ﬁnally, belong to this category of instruments leading the way to a new frontier in measurement
techniques and hence in physics. At the LHC, close to the interaction point, no other detector instrument is capable
to cope as well with the high density and rate of particle tracks and stand the ﬁerce radiation environment. There
is no large improvement in spatial resolution when comparing to strip detectors, however pixel detectors return
true 3D space points, a necessity for pattern recognition and tracking in the LHC environment near the interaction
point. The channel density increases by more than an order of magnitude compared to strip detectors to about 5000
channels/cm2. Fast readout of such a large (in terms of channels) and complex system required new technologies
and methods, which have been developed during the past decade and are subject to this lecture.

1.2. Tracking detectors at the LHC

At the LHC with a center of mass energy of 14 TeV on average 22 interactions with

1200 tracks occur during one
bunch crossing every 25 ns. This is a track rate of 50 GHz, about 106 times the track rate that LEP encountered.
The total particle ﬂuence is 1015 neq/cm2 over a projected 10 year life time at the LHC, where the damage created
by the charged and neutral particles, mostly pions and protons near the IP, has been normalized to the equivalent
of the damage of 1 MeV neutrons (neq). This ﬂuence of particles causes lattice damage by collisions with the lattice
atoms (non-ionizing energy loss), but also by ionization of atoms which corresponds to a total dose of 600 kGy in
250 µm silicon bulk material assuming minimum ionizing particles (mips).

hemisphere as the track, otherwise the sign is negative.

Figure 1:

1 Pattern recognition and tracking

Precision tracking points are provided in three dimensions which can be used as precise seeds for the recon-
struction of tracks. With respect to this task a pixel layer is probably as valuable as 3 to 4 layers of microstrip
detectors which need x,y as well as u,v strip orientations to resolve the ambiguities existing in an environment
with many tracks per uni area.

In order to assess which are the important parameters for a micro vertex detector, a simple 2-layer detector
example already provides the most important insights. Consider in Fig. 2 conﬁguration in which ﬁrst the outer layer,
detector-2 is assumed to have perfect resolution (σ2=0, Fig. 2(a)). The impact parameter error of the track σb is
thus determined by σ1, the resolution of the ﬁrst layer and the aspect ratio of the two layers

from which it is obvious what to pay attention to for vertexing: the innermost layer of a vertex detector must be as

The inner tracking systems of ATLAS, CMS and ALICE all employ semiconductor detectors, as the event rate
and complexity does not allow large volume gas-ﬁlled detectors which were still the best suited tracking detectors
for experiments at LEP and SLC. Some essential parameters of the tracking systems are give in Table I.

The ATLAS inner detector has three systems: a 1.8 m2 pixel detector, a semiconductor tracker (SCT) consisting
of Si micro strip detectors of about 60 m2 and a transition radiation tracker (TRT) made of individual straw tube,
providing on average 36 points on a track. The pixel detector comes as 3 barrel layers and 3 disks on either side. It

2. Hybrid Pixel Detectors for the LHC

2.1. The pixel detector principle

Figures 7(a) and (b) show the principle of the hybrid pixel technology. A pixellated silicon pn-diode as sensor and
a readout chip, 1-1 corresponding in every pixel cell, are connected via tiny conductive bumps using the bumping and
ﬂip-chip technology. A traversing particle creates charges (electrons and holes) in the sensor by ionization. Separated
by the electric ﬁeld applied to the sensor, the movements of negative and positive charges induce a signal on the
pixel electrode above (and may be also on its neighbors). The signal is ampliﬁed, discriminated and digitized by the
electronics circuitry in the pixel cell of the chip and is then transmitted to the periphery.

The detection principle is - with one peculiarity, explained below - the same as that of a pn-junction in reverse

bias (Fig. 8). The characteristic distribution of the space charge is directly derived from the neutrality condition

in which NA,ND are the number of acceptors and donors, respectively, and xn, xp denote the coordinates of the

space charge boundaries. Assuming an abrupt transition between n and p regions this results in a rectangular shape
of the respective space charge regions with a constant charge density. The electric ﬁeld and the built-in potential
result from two integrations of the ﬁrst Maxwell equation

and the electric ﬁeld falls linearly from the front to the back. Normally sensors are operated with in over-depletion
resulting in a non-zero ﬁeld at the back side which is beneﬁcial for a fast charge collection (see Fig. 9(a)). The
capacitance of the device can be treated as a parallel plate capacitor

and grows inversely propostional to √Vext. This allows to determine the full depletion voltage from a capacitance
measurement as shown in Fig. 9(b).

that pixel sensor are also suited to detect radiation: a 10 keV X-ray photon, when absorbed, generates about 3000
e/h pairs or 0.5 fC. The generated charges are separated by the electric ﬁeld inside the sensor and drift with drift

number, density and thickness of the traversed matter. This function peaks very steeply by orders of magnitude at
angles close to 90◦. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, δ-electrons are almost always emitted under right angles and are
highly ionizing. The eﬀect of a δ electron emission in a silicon pixel detector is sketched in Fig. 10. A 100 keV δ
electron occurs in 300 µm thick silicon with 6% probability and has a typical range of 60 µm. Hence it created
about 4500 e/h pairs along its path, perpendicular to the parent particle. This causes several neighbor pixels to ﬁre.
The reconstructed ’hit‘’ will thus be systematically shifted to the side of the δ electron emission.

As mentioned before the signal on the electrodes is induced by the movement of the separated charges in the

electric ﬁeld inside the sensor. This is generally described by the Ramo theorem [7] as

potential. They have nothing to do with the electric ﬁeld and potential inside the sensor, but rather determine how
the charge movement couples to a speciﬁc electrode. The weighting ﬁeld can be calculated by setting the potential
of the electrode under consideration to 1 (or 1V) and all other electrodes to 0 (0V) as indicated in Fig. 11(a).

In a 2-electrode conﬁguration (e.g. an area diode) the calculation is rather simple: set the top electrode of the

where x and y are the coordinates and a is the pixel width. The form of the weighting potential is shown in Fig. 12(a).
Also shown are two parallel drift trajectories, one ending on the electrode considered (dotted arrow) and the other
on the neighbor electrode (dashed arrow). The corresponding current signals are displayed in Fig. 12(b). For both
pixels initially the current signals are identical, independent of the electrode which eventually collects the charge.
While the trajectory of the hit pixel, however, shows a rapidly increasing (negative) current signal when approaching
the electrode, the signal of the neighbor trajectory crosses the zero line and then goes positive resulting in a vanishing
net integral of the pulse (i.e. the total charge). Most of the signal is induced on the pixel electrodes only shortly
before the drifting charge cloud arrives at the pixel (small pixel eﬀect).

Finally, pixel detectors at LHC are operated in magnetic ﬁelds (2T for ATLAS, 4T for CMS). In a B-ﬁeld the drift
motion of the charge clouds is on a circle. This motion is stopped on average after one mean free path length of the
drifting electrons, resulting in a complicated path which can be described by an eﬀective motion towards the readout
electrode under an angle αL, the Lorentz angle, as

tan αL = µHallB⊥

(14)

where µHall is the Hall mobility, which diﬀers by a factor 1.15 (0.72) from the normal mobility for electrons (holes).
The Lorentz angle has been measured [9, 10] in ATLAS (2T ﬁeld) to be -15◦ before irradiation with 150 V depletion
voltage, and to -5◦ after irradiation with 600 V depletion voltage, respectively. This diﬀerence is mostly due to a
decrease of the mobility with increasing electric ﬁeld inside the sensor. Note that the eﬀective incidence angle to the
electrode is given by the sum of the Lorentz angle and the tilt angle, by which the pixel modules are tilted out of
the perpendicular plane. This tilt angle in ATLAS is +20◦.

2.3. The noise

physical noise sources

For noise considerations in detector and electronics readout conﬁgurations it is important to consider the following

- number ﬂuctuations of quanta, which lead to 1. shot noise and 2. 1/f noise

- velocity ﬂuctuations of quanta which lead to 3. thermal noise.

Shot noise is generated when charge quanta are emitted over a barrier, as is the case in a diode. Thermal noise occurs
from statistical thermal motion of charge carriers, here inside the transistor channel of the amplifying transistor. 1/f
noise in a FET has its physical origin in the trapping and releasing of charge carriers in traps in the Si-SiO2 interface
of the transistor channel.

Where do these noise sources appear in a typical pixel detector readout chain (cf. Fig. 14) ?

(a) A typical charge integrating pixel detector readout, represented here by a single amplifying FET and the three main
noise sources: shot noise from detector leakage current, and thermal as well as 1/f noise in the transistor channel. (b)
Transistor thermal and 1/f noise is treated as serial voltage noise at the input of the preampliﬁer.

Figure 14:

Using i2 = (gmvin)2 the current noise source inside the transistor channel can be regarded as a voltage noise source

in series at the input of the ampliﬁer (c.f. Fig. 14(b)). The noise sources then can be written as

Pixel detector readout with a charge integrating preampliﬁer and a ﬁlter ampliﬁer (shaper).

Figure 15:

Note that the noise depends on three important quantities to which attention has to be paid to: the sensor leakage
current Ileak and the shaping time τ , both of which increase the parallel shot noise contribution, and the total input
capacitance, dominated by the detector capacitance CD, which increases the two parallel noise components (thermal
and 1/f). The shaping time decreases the thermal noise which results in the fact that the three noise contributions
to the detector/readout conﬁguration have a minimum at an optimum shaping time τopt, as is sketched in Fig. 16.

The three noise contributions (thermal, 1/f and shot noise) as a function of the shaping time in a logarithmic representation.
The dependence results in a minimal total noise at an optimal shaping time.

Pixel detectors have the advantage of small input capacitances in the order of several hundred fF and thus have

the potential of being low noise devices. Typical ﬁgures for LHC pixel detectors are

3. Making a Pixel Detector
From the pixel sensor to the module-ladder

The particle ﬂuence that pixel detectors at 5cm distance from the IP at LHC have to expect during 10 years of
operation is about 1015 neq/cm2. This fact constitutes enormous challenges to pixel sensors, which develop large
leakage currents and need high voltages for full depletion, as well as to the front end electronics, which suﬀers from
threshold shifts and generated parasitic transistors; but also to the mechanic elements whose material performance
degrades, glue becomes brittle, etc. This has required intensive irradiation tests over many years.

3.1. Hybrid Pixel Assembly

A so called bare pixel module consists of the pixel sensors and a number of electronics chips for ampliﬁcation
and readout (16 in the case of ATLAS and CMS, 5 for ALICE) which are mated by means of the bumping and
ﬂip-chipping technology ([11, 12] and [5]). In the case of ATLAS the 10 cm sensor wafer has three 2.1 x 6.4 cm2
sized sensor tiles. The 20 cm chip wafer instead has 288 7.1 x 11.4 mm2 sized front end chips which have been
tested to be functional with an average yield of 82%. The mating is done in part with indium bumps [12] or solder
bumps [11, 13]. Each chip has about 3000 such bumps. The chip wafers are thinned by backside grinding after
bumping from initially about 800 µm thickness down to 180 µm. Figure 17 shows a bare module after assembly and
a cut through a bump row, which nicely shows the module after the mating process (here solder). The bumps in
case of Indium are about 7 µm high and are applied on both, sensor and chip wafer. After thermo-compression the
remaining thickness is about 10 µm. Solder bumps are applied only to the chip wafers and are 25 µm in diameter,
and about 20 µm after ﬂip-chip and reﬂow (see Fig. 17).

cut through the bump row showing the bumps and the metal layers of the chip electronics.

Figure 17:

To produce a fully functional module, additional assembly steps are necessary as shown in Fig. 18. The output
lines are connected via wire bonds to a ﬂex-kapton hybrid foil with ﬁne-print lines. The signals are routed to a
further chip, the module control chip MCC and from there through another ﬂex component (pigtail) to the micro
cables which run to the electro-optical interface which is in ATLAS between about 20 cm and 120 cm away from the
module. Figure 18 also shows a CMS-pixel module, fully assembled.

3.2. Pixel Sensors in the LHC radiation environment

The intense radiation at LHC requires dedicated designs for both sensor and FE-chip. For the sensor, mostly
the non-ionizing energy loss which produces non-reversible lattice damage is important in this respect. Figure 20(a)
sketches the main defect appearances. We distinguish so called point defects and defect clusters, the latter originate
200 nm. For pixels
from damage that a recoiling lattice atom can cause. The size of the clusters typically is 10 nm

sensors the largest concern comes from double vacancies and interstitials, both producing generation/recombination
levels deep in the band gap which lead to an increase of the leakage current, and therefore to higher noise (see
eq. 17). Also the eﬀective space charge in the depletion region is changed leading to an increase of the eﬀective
doping concentration and as a consequence an increase in the necessary voltage for full depletion. This is shown in

the ﬂuence. Nef f ﬁrst decreases to zero and then becomes almost intrinsic at a ﬂuence of 2-5
rises again (type inversion) [14]. The eﬀective doping concentration after irradiation damage also changes with time
as shown in Fig. 19(b): beneﬁcial annealing occurs at short time scales, so-called reverse annealing at longer time
scales [15]. The latter is suppressed when keeping the damaged sensors at low temperatures below the freezing point.
At -10◦ C the time constant for reverse annealing is about 500 years, while at +20◦ C it is only about 500 days [16].
Finally, trapping centers are being created which can trap the signal charge and thus lead to a loss in signal.
Solutions to irradiation damage in silicon have been found through intensive R&D, most notably by the CERN

RD48 and RD50 collaboration [15, 17, 18, 19]. For the ﬂuences expected at LHC in the pixel detector oxygenated
ﬂoat zone silicon has proven to stand the expected irradiation from protons and pions within the operation specs of
the detectors (e.q. 600 V maximum bias voltage), while for neutrons which produce less point defects but more cluster
defects this is not the case. Close to the interaction region, however, particle ﬂuence by pions is dominant. The pixel
sensor design has also been adapted to the development of the eﬀective doping concentration with increasing ﬂuence
by chosing n+ pixel implants on lower doped n-bulk material. Figure 20(b) shows the development of the depletion
region for p+ in n and for n+ in n pixel sensors in comparison. The depletion zone grows from the higher doped
p-region into the lower doped n-bulk, in the presence of type-inversion under irradiation. While. after type inversion,
for the standard p in n sensors the depletion region grows from the non-pixellated bottom, which requires to always
operate under full depletion, for n in n sensors after type inversion the depletion region grows from the electrode
(i.e. pixel) side. This allows operation also without full depletion which might be unavoidable after several years of
LHC-running. At the n-pixel n-bulk interface at the top, measures are taken to prevent the electron accumulation
layer, which develops a the Si-SiO2 interface where there is no intrinsic depletion zone as is the case for a pn interface.
Figure 21 shows the diﬀerent advantages and disadvantages of isolation measures using either p-stop implants between
the n-implants, or a lighted doped boron p-spray in the entire region between implants. The highest ﬁelds occur
always at the lateral pn junctions. Irradiation increases the oxide charges and also the substrate doping, such that the
backside bias must be increased after irradiation. This generally increases also the maximum ﬁeld with irradiation.
For the p-spray situation the sensor develops high ﬁelds initially. The concentration of the shallow p-layer can be
chosen such that when the oxide charges go into saturation the p-spray layer goes into depletion which results in a
decrease of the ﬁelds with irradiation. Finally, the moderated p-spray, i.e. p-spray with a doping proﬁle, keeps the
best of both worlds [20].

Figure 22(a) shows the edge of a pixel module. As the edge of the sensor is conducting the backside bias voltage
must be brought to 0V by a voltage dividing guard ring structure. Otherwise the risk of discharge is present over

the small gap between sensor and chip. In normal operation the sensor pixels have a deﬁned potential by contact
to the FE-chip. For testing purposes of the sensor, however, before bonding has been done, this is not the case.
This problem has been overcome by introducing a bias grid which runs around all pixels (see Fig. 22(b)). Applying
the punch through voltage to the grid via an external contact, all pixels are brought to a deﬁned potential by the
punch-through eﬀect (more details can be found in [5]). The bias grid of course produces additional implants in the

pixel cell which lead to a reduced charge collection eﬃciency in this region by some 10-20%. This is however tolerable
in expense for being able to thoroughly test the sensors before module assembly.

Pixel detectors oﬀer a nice way of measuring the depletion depth after irradiation by exposing them to particle
beams under a steep angle of inclination, the shallow angle method [21]. This is illustrated in Fig. 23(a). The
observed cluster size is a direct measure for the depletion depth. Figure 23(b) shows the measured cluster size for
diﬀerent bias voltages for CMS pixels, which correspond to fully and less depleted pixel sensors. Full depletion after
irradiation is only obtained for bias voltages of more than 450 V. Trapping eﬀects due to irradiation can also be
measured using the shallow angle method as the track passes the pixel cells in a varying depth [22]. If trapping
occurs, the collected charge depends on the distance of the track passage to the pixel electrode.

sizes of ATLAS and ALICE are 50
is organized in 18 columns time 160 rows, in total 2880 pixel cells, which are processed in parallel. The readout is
zero-suppressed. A block diagram of the functionality is shown in Fig. 24. The current signal of a hit is integrated
by a charge sensitive preampliﬁer, whose feedback capacitor is discharged by a constant current. This results into
a triangular pulse shape. The pulse then runs through a discriminator which issues a norm pulse whose length is
determined by the times at which the rising and the falling edges of the input cross the discriminator threshold. The
length of the output pulse is thus a measure of the time over threshold (ToT) which in turn is a measure of the total
charge. The address of the pixel cell and the time stamps are stored into RAM storage at the periphery. A fast
scanner through a double column picks up the valid hit addresses and time stamps and stores them into buﬀers at
the bottom of the pixel columns where they remain waiting for the ATLAS ﬁrst level trigger. The hits are removed
from the buﬀers if no trigger occurs in coincidence with the time stamps. If the trigger time agrees with the time
stamp a hit is read out. Requirements to the front end chip are that the noise hit rate be kept small compared to
the real hit rate. It is demanded that the quadratic sum of the noise value and the spread of the thresholds over the
chip be more than a factor of ﬁve below the chosen threshold. For a nominal threshold setting of 3000 e− this means
less than 600 e−. The obtained noise ﬁgures are in the order of 50-60e−. The untuned threshold dispersion is
600
e−. It is possible to tune (correct) the threshold settings by a 7-bit digital trim DAC. After tuning the dispersion
is drastically reduced however to values much lower than 100e−, thus easily meeting the above requirement. The
functional blocks of the CMS Pixel chip [25, 26] are similar. However, CMS additionally stores the analog pulse
height in a sample and hold stage, i.e. have a direct analog readout, while the ATLAS readout is analog through the
ToT trick. In CMS the amplitude as well as the row and column addresses are then coded in analog levels. Figure 25
shows the overlay of 4160 pixel readouts in the CMS system [27]. Every event starts with an ’ultra black’ followed
by seven clock cycles, ﬁve of which encode 13 bits for the pixel address. The analog pixel pulse height then follows
in the seventh clock cycle.

3.4. Radiation effects in the front end electronics

The radiation eﬀects that pixel chips suﬀer from diﬀer from those already described for the pixel sensors. For
CMOS chips it is mostly the ionizing radiation that generates positive charges in the SiO2 and also creates defects
in the Si-SiO2 interface as shown in Fig. 26(a). The mobility of electrons (high) and holes (low) is vastly diﬀerent
in SiO2 such that charge pairs created by ionization produce low mobility positive charges in the gate oxide while
the electrons have escape. This creates a net positive oxide charge and as a consequence a shift in the transistor
threshold. Another eﬀect is the generation of leakage currents under the ﬁeld oxide, which in eﬀect creates parasitic

∼

Also the digital parts of the front end electronics are aﬀected by the radiation at LHC. Most prominently radiation
induced bit errors, so called ’single event upsets’ (SEU) are reasons of concern. Large amounts of charge on certain
circuit nodes, created for instance by nuclear reactions or high track densities can cause a bit-ﬂip. Two examples of

It can be noted that while the noise and threshold distributions vary more from chip to chip, which can be seen in
the bottom scatter plots, the quadratic sum of their averages still remains well under 300e−, i.e. comfortably away
from the nominal threshold setting of 3000e−. The spatial resolution of irradiated modules decreases by about 40%
and the in-time hit eﬃciency - the eﬃciency of hit detection within the 25 ns time window of the LHC bunch crossing
- decreases from 99.9% before irradiation to 97.8% after 600 kGy.

3.5. Support structures and material issues

The pixel modules are loaded on ladders and disks to complete the detector. The main goal for detector builders
in this respect is to minimize the amount of material in terms of radiation length imposed by the support structure
and the cooling mechanics, which is particularly diﬃcult to achieve when the operation temperature is required
to be about -5◦ to -10◦ C in order to block the reverse annealing eﬀect (see chapter 3.2). Figure 29 shows the
mechanical support structures of the pixel detectors for ATLAS, CMS and ALICE. In central heavy ion collisions,
the environment of the ALICE detector, up to 8000 charged particles per unit of rapidity are produced, generating
hit densities of about 80 hits / cm2. As the luminosity for heavy ion collisions is much smaller than for pp collisions

(L
≈
1012 neq / cm2. Hence, operation at temperatures below zero to suppress the reverse annealing

eﬀect, are not mandatory. Instead, operation at room temperature is possible. ALICE has exploited this [28] for the
beneﬁt of reducing the cooling needs and the material. Using a light weight carbon ﬁbre structure in a chamber type
fashion rather than ladders and shell structures, and using C4F10 as coolant with very thin cooling pipes (PHYNOX)
of 40 µm wall thickness only, they arrive at a total material budget at η = 0 of only 0.9% of a radiation length. For
comparison, ATLAS and CMS have about 2.5%.

3.6. Summary on Hybrid Pixel Detectors

Hybrid pixel detectors constitute the state of the art in pixel detectors at present. The have proven to be suited for
LHC conditions in terms of readout speed as well as radiation hardness. Every cell already provides complex signal
processing including zero suppression. Hits are temporarily stored during the trigger latency of several µm. The 3D
capability renders pixel detectors at LHC superior to any other detector regarding pattern recognition capability.
The spatial hit resolution is about 10-15 µm in the transverse direction.

4. Pixel R&D for Future Colliders

4.1. Challenges imposed by a Super-LHC

The data rate and also the radiation levels expected at an LHC upgrade, called Super-LHC or sLHC, are a factor
1016neq/cm2 at a radius of 4 cm. Concerning irradiatio issues

of up to ten higher than at the LHC, i.e. about 2
there are mainly three eﬀects as a consequence (see review [16]).

×

1. A change of the eﬀective doping concentration (higher depletion voltage necessary, under-depletion)

2. An increase of leakage current (increase of shot noise, thermal runaway)

3. An increase of charge carrier trapping (loss of charge)

Several routes to cope with this are being pursued, among them the development of even more radiation hard silicon
based on oxygenated ﬂoat-zone (DOFZ), Czochralski (Cz), n+ in p silicon sensors, as well as epitaxial silicon [16].
For this lecture I would like to address in this context two new approaches which are more linked to pixel detectors:
diamond pixel detectors and 3D-silicon devices.

4.2. Diamond Pixels

109Cd radioactive source (22 keV γ), (c) scatter plot of position correlation between the diamond pixel detector and a reference
beam telescope, and (d) measured Landau distribution in a CVD-diamond pixel detector.

24

CVD-Diamond as a sensor material has been developed by the CERN R&D group RD42 for many years [29].
Charge collection distances approaching 300 µm has also triggered the development of a hybrid pixel detector using
diamond as sensors [30, 31]. The non-uniform ﬁeld distribution inside CVD-diamond, which originates from the grain
structure in the charge collecting bulk (cf. Fig. 32(a)) introduces polarization ﬁelds inside the sensor due to charge
trapping at the grain boundaries which superimpose on the biasing electric ﬁeld. This results in position dependent
systematic shifts in the track reconstruction with a typical average grain size of 100µm - 150µm [32]. Diamond
sensors with charge collection distances in excess of 300µm have been fabricated and tested [33]. Single chip pixel
modules as well as a full size wafer scale 16-chip module assembled using ATLAS front-end chips have been built and
tested. Figure 31(a) and (b) show the diamond pixel detector and a hit response pattern obtained by exposing the
detector to a 109Cd source of 22 keV γ rays, which deposits approximately 1/4 of the charge of a minimum ionizing
particle. The single chip module has been tested in a high energy (180 GeV) pion beam at CERN, the module in a
4 GeV electron beam at DESY. Figure 31(c) and (d) show position correlation and the charge distribution of the
∼
diamond pixel detector in a high energy beam, respectively. A spatial resolution of σ = 12µm has been measured
with the single chip module at high energies with 50µm pixel pitch. A technical challenge to produce a wafer scale
module lies in the hybridization process, i.e. bump deposition and ﬂip-chipping. Figure 32 shows the 16-chip diamond
module (Fig. 32(b), chips are on the bottom) and its tuned threshold map (Fig. 32(c)) with a very small dispersion
of only 25e− and good bump yield homogeneity. One chip was damaged during test beam by electrostatic discharge.
The rms of the position residuals was measured to 24 µm in the DESY 6 GeV beam [31] including a large multiple
scattering contribution from the beam telescope.

4.3. 3D silicon sensors

So-called 3D silicon detectors have been developed [34] to overcome several limitations of conventional planar
Si-pixel detectors, in particular in high radiation environments, in applications with inhomogeneous irradiation and
in applications which require a large active/inactive area ratio such as protein crystallography. A 3D-Si-structure
(Fig. 33(a)) is obtained by processing the n+ and p+ poly silicon electrodes into the detector bulk rather than by
conventional implantation on the surface. This is done by combining VLSI and MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical
Systems) technologies. Charge carriers drift inside the bulk parallel to the detector surface over a short drift distance
of typically 50µm. Another feature is the fact that the edge of the sensor can be a collection electrode itself thus

25

planar electrode silicon detector, (bottom right) a 3D-silicon detector.

extending the active area of the sensor to within few µm to the edge. Edge electrodes also avoid inhomogeneous ﬁelds
and surface leakage currents which usually occur due to chips and cracks at the sensor edges. The main advantages
of 3D-silicon detectors, however, come from a diﬀerent way of charge collection (cf. Fig. 33(b)) and the fact that
the electrode distance is short (50µm) in comparison to conventional planar devices at the same total charge. This
results in a fast (1-2 ns) collection time, low (< 10V) depletion voltage and, with edge electrodes in addition, a large
active/inactive area ratio of the device. The technical fabrication is much more involved than for planar processes
and requires a bonded support wafer and reactive ion etching of the electrodes into the bulk. Prototype detectors
using strip or pixel electronics have been fabricated [35] and show encouraging results with respect to speed (3.5 ns
1015 protons/cm2) [36]. 3D-pixel detectors with ATLAS frontend electronics

have also been successfully built. Preliminary results have been presented in [37].

4.4. Monolithic and Semi-Monolithic Pixel Detectors

Monolithic pixel detectors, in which amplifying and logic circuitry as well as the radiation detecting sensor are
one entity, are in the focus of present developments for future experiments. To reach this ambitious goal, optimally
using a commercially available and cost eﬀective technology, would be another breakthrough in the ﬁeld. The
present developments have been much inﬂuenced by R&D for vertex tracking detectors at future colliders such as
the International Linear e+e− Collider (ILC) [38]. Very low (
1% X0) material per detector layer, small pixel sizes
≪
20µm) and a high rate capability (80 hits/mm2/ms) are required, due to the very intense beamstrahlung
(
∼
of narrowly focussed electron beams close to the interaction region, which produce electron positron pairs in vast
numbers. High readout speeds with typical line rates of several 10 MHz and a 40µs frame readout time are necessary.
At present, two developments have already reached some level of maturity: so called CMOS active pixels and
DEPFET pixels.

20µm

4.4.1. CMOS active pixels

In some CMOS chip technologies a lightly doped epitaxial silicon layer of a few to 15µm thickness between the low
resistivity silicon bulk and the planar processing layer can be used for charge collection [39, 40, 41]. The generated
charge is kept in a thin epi-layer atop the low resistivity silicon bulk by potential wells that develop at the boundary
and reaches an n-well collection diode by thermal diﬀusion (cf. Fig. 34). With small pixel cells collection times in
the order of 100 ns are obtained. The charge collecting epi-layer is – technology dependent – at most 15µm thick

26

the very few µm thick epitaxial Si-layer.

and can also be completely absent. The attractiveness of active CMOS pixels lies in the fact that standard CMOS
processing techniques are employed and hence they are potentially very cheap. CMOS active pixel sensor development
are pursued by many groups which partially collaborate in various projects (BELLE-upgrade, STAR-upgrade, ILC,
CBM at GSI) who use similar approaches to develop large scale CMOS active pixels, also called MAPS (Monolithic
Active Pixel Sensors) [39]. The sensor is depleted only directly under the n-well diode. The signal charge is hence
very small (<1000e) and full charge collection is obtained only in the depleted region under the n-well electrode.
Low noise electronics is therefore the challenge in this development.

×

Matrix readout of MAPS is performed using a standard 3-transistor circuit (line select, source-follower stage, reset)
commonly employed by CMOS matrix devices, but can also include current ampliﬁcation and current memory [42].
In the active area only nMOS transistors are permitted because of the n-well/p-epi collecting diode which does
not permit other n-wells. For an image two complete frames are subtracted from each other (correlated double
sampling, CDS) to eliminate base levels, 1/f and ﬁxed pattern noise (see Figure 35). In a second step pedestals and
common mode noise are subtracted to extract the signal and to determine the remaining noise. Detector sizes up to
17.4 mm2 with 1M pixels have been tested. Frame speeds of 10µs for 132x48 pixels have been reached for the
19.4
BELLE development, with a noise ﬁgure of 30-50e− [43]. With other pixel matrices with slower readout noise values
of 15-20 e−, S/N ratios larger than 20 and spatial resolutions of 1.5µm (5µm) for 20µm (40µm) pitch have been
measured [44]. The presently favored technology is the AMS 0.35µm OPTO process, which possesses a 10µm thick

epitaxial layer. Regarding radiation hardness MAPS appear to sustain non-ionizing radiation (NIEL) to
The eﬀects of ionizing radiation damage (IEL), the main damage source at the ILC, are threshold shifts and leakage
currents in and between nMOS transistors. The damage eﬀects are less severe when short readout integration times
(
∼

10µs) are used. This way doses of about 10 kGy can be tolerated [44].
The present focus of further development lies in improving the radiation tolerant design, making 50µm thin
detectors, making larger area devices for instance by stitching over reticle boundaries [41], and increasing the charge
collection performance in the epi-layer.

4.4.2. DEPFET pixels

transistor channel (internal gate) thus modulating its current (Fig. 36). Electrons collected in the internal gate
are completely [47] removed by a clear pulse applied to a dedicated contact outside the transistor. Ampliﬁcation
300 pA per collected electron in the internal gate have been achieved. Further current ampliﬁcation and

storage enters at the second level stage. The bulk is fully depleted yielding large signals and the small capacitance
of the internal gate oﬀers low noise operation, for a very large S/N ratio. This in turn can be used to fabricate very
thin devices. Thinning of pn-diodes to a thickness of 50µm using a technology based on wafer bonding and deep
anisotropic etching has been successfully demonstrated [48].

Readout of a DEPFET matrix is done by selecting a row by a gate voltage from a sequencer chip (SWITCHER)

DEPFET sensors is shown in Fig. 37(top). Figure 37(bottom) shows a DEPFET pixel matrix readout system used

The radiation tolerance, in particular against ionizing radiation, which is expected to doses of 2 kGy due to
10 kGy, about
beamstrahlung at the ILC, again is a crucial question. Irradiation with 30 keV X-rays up to doses of
ﬁve times the amount expected at the ILC, have lead to transistor threshold shifts of only about 4 V. Threshold shifts
of this order can be coped with by an adjustment of the corresponding gate voltages supplied by the SWITCHER
chip. The estimated power consumption for a ﬁve layer DEPFET pixel vertex detector at the ILC – assuming a

5-10W. Such a performance renders a very low mass detector without
power duty cycle of 1:200 – is in the order of
64 pixels has been tested in a 6 GeV electron beam at
cooling pipes feasible. A DEPFET pixel matrix with 128
DESY [51]. The noise values obtained for the full system in the test beam including sampling noise of the CURO chip
is 200-300e−. The signal in a 450 µm thick DEPFET sensor was about 35000e−. At 6 GeV beam energy the spatial
residuals are still multiple scattering dominated. Residuals on the order of 10µm are obtained, while with the large
S/N value of 144 true space resolutions in the order of 2µm should be possible and has been recently demonstrated
using high energy test beams at CERN [52].

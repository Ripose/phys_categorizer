Abstract— A programmable trigger logic module (TRILOMO)
was implemented successfully in an FPGA using their internal
look-up tables to save Boolean functions. Up to 16 trigger input
signals can be combined logically for a fast trigger decision. The
new feature is that the trigger decision is VME register based. The
changes are made without modifying the FPGA code. Additionally
the module has an excellent signal delay adjustment.

in the next section. Additions required for full functionality
in experimental environments like adjustable input delay and
VME access are explained in section three. Section four de-
scribes a measurement of the time jitter of the leading edge of
trigger signals passing the module. Applications of TRILOMO
in experimental setups as well as new applications which are
possible by reprogramming the FPGA are detailed in section
ﬁve.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. BASIC CONCEPTS

Increasing requirements on timing precision and speed of
logic decisions in modern experiments demand the development
of new fast and ﬂexible logic modules. Field Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGA) allow programming of highly complex
circuitries by combining a large number of small simple el-
ements. They offer a high ﬂexibility of the board after the
hardware is build. The main idea is to program the FPGA
using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) but keeping
certain ﬂexibility in the logic function. Distributed RAM can
simulate any gate functionality in FPGAs. An VME interface
is coded to select any logic function in a simple way. Thus
a change in the logic function can be done on-the-ﬂy without
altering the HDL code. This has two advantages: ﬁrst the ﬁnal
user of TRILOMO can change the logic without the knowledge
of a sophisticated HDL and second the propagation time is
independent of the logic function. That makes the presented
module special against non processor FPGA trigger modules
found elsewhere [1]. Common applications for the board can
be found in all experiments with triggered data acquisition.

The basic principle of using RAM for the logic decision
could also be achieved by commercial SRAM chips. The RAM
in FPGAs is however optimized for very fast logic decisions and
one gains in ﬂexibility. Complex programmable logic devices
(CPLD) and wired solutions miss the possibility to program
different Boolean functions and to obtain high speed at the same
time. Furthermore FPGAs are more cost effective for small
scale projects than Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits
(ASIC).

A single slot 6U VME board has been designed and as-
sembled with a FPGA as central element and NIM logic
inputs/outputs. The functionality of the FPGA can be modiﬁed
via the VME bus. The basic principle to use the RAM in
the FPGA for fast and modiﬁable logic decisions is described

The VME board hosts 16 inputs and 1 output for the logic
unit. The main processing happens in a central FPGA. The
logic combination of the inputs is arbitrarily selectable. The
result is given to the output in the fastest possible way. These
main speciﬁcations make the board ideal to obtain fast trigger
decisions.

Look-up tables (LUT) are basic combinational elements of
FPGAs and may be programmed as RAM. Spartan II XC2S200-
6 [2] produced by Xilinx Inc. provides blocks of 16 bit
RAM with 0.5 ns asynchronous read access. The use of RAM
structure ensures constant propagation times independent of
the selected function. The logic functions of the LUTs are
deﬁned by the content of the RAM and can be easily modiﬁed
by writing different values to the RAM. Since the RAM is
accessable from a VME interface [3] the logic functionality of
TRILOMO can be modiﬁed by the user without the knowledge
of a HDL.

The principle of wiring LUTs is shown in ﬁgure 1. Four
inputs are freely combined in a LUT in the ﬁrst stage giving
16 possible signal combinations. In a second stage the output
together with three other parallel outputs are combined again
in a LUT to form the ﬁnal trigger output. In standard mode the
multiplexers pass the inputs to read the LUTs asynchronously
(solid lines). In this mode the levels of the input lines form
an address to read the memory. The stored bit of that address
deﬁnes the output level.

In write mode the multiplexer disables external input lines
and instead enables lines to the VME bus to address the RAM
(dashed lines). On a rising edge of a clock cycle a data bit is
set for a given address of a selected LUT while the RAM is
hold in write access. Successively all 80 bits can be altered to
deﬁne a Boolean function.

In a mathematical subspace of four inputs all possible
Boolean functions can be coded. In the full space of 16 inputs
a large number of Boolean functions is possible but not the

whole function space. This is due to the fact that one would
need 216 bits to implement all possible functions whereas in
the presented solution 5 × 16 = 80 bits are used for the trigger
logic. However, any reasonable Boolean function should be
implementable.

III. LOGIC UNIT

A picture of the TRILOMO board is given in ﬁgure 2.
The adequate block diagram for a deeper understanding of the
electronics structure is visible in ﬁgure 3. Trigger inputs and
outputs are current driven and follow the NIM standard (high
input level -12 mA to -32 mA, output -14 mA to -32 mA; low
level > +2 mA). The minimal input pulse width is 2 ns. The
output pulse width can be adjusted between 5 ns and 30 ns. The
propagation time from any input to output is (20 ± 1) ns. The
time jitter of the output signal is less than 120 ps with respect
to the input signals.

Different signal delays, either on board or outside, can be
compensated by programmable delay lines which are imple-
mented between the input plugs and FPGA. Consequently
variation between inputs can be corrected to the order of a
few picoseconds and hence coincidence times as short as 3.9 ns
are possible. For the delay we use single-channel chips of the
type MC100EP195 [4]. The delay lines can be programmed
individually via the VME interface in steps of 10 ps up to
10.23 ns.

The key element, a Spartan II XC2S200-6, offers about
200,000 sytem gates and a system performance up to 200 MHz.
The FPGA can load the HDL design code (1.3 Mbit) after
power up via a PROM of type XC18V04 [2]. Alternatively
the program can be loaded via VME interface.

A CPLD of the type X95288XL-10 [2] realises VME access
to the FPGA. It is connected through buffers to the 32-bit VME
data bus and to the 32-bit VME address bus. Within the VME
architecture the board acts as a VME slave module. The CPLD
controls any write and read access between the FPGA and VME
bus over a 16-bit address and a 32-bit data bus. By means of this
bus the logic decision and other parameters can be redeﬁned.
Hot-swap circuitries [5] are used such that the module can
be safely inserted and extracted without the necessity to switch
off the crate. The average power consumption is 15 W.

The eight layer board is optimized in terms of impedance
lines are in

matching and cross talk avoiding. The signal
200 µm micro strip technology and the via size is 600 µm.

Additional gate, synchronisation, reset and clock inputs and
outputs are implemented to integrate the module into a wider
trigger electronics environment. Partially the signals are dubli-
cated to backplane connectors or converted to ECL standard at
the front of the module.

IV. JITTER

The time jitter of the leading edge of the input signal with re-
spect to the output signal was measured beside functional tests
and high frequency tests. The time jitter inﬂuences the minimal

coincidence time given in a former section. Furthermore is the
time jitter relevant if the time information of the leading edge of
the trigger signal is used. A high resolution TDC [6] was used
to measure the time jitter. The diagram in ﬁgure 4 shows the
distribution of the time jitter. The underlying curve reﬂects the
time resolution of the test setup, i.e. the TDC. The conclusion is
that TRILOMO does not contribute additional time jitter above
the time resolution of the test setup which is 120 ps.

V. APPLICATIONS

TRILOMO is suitable for applications where fast trigger
decisions are required. Typical applications are found in ex-
periments of atomic, nuclear and particle physics. Short signal
delays and precise timing allow high input rates up to 100 MHz.
The trigger decision can be set from a terminal on-the-ﬂy
without recabeling. The module can be cascaded so that the
number of trigger inputs can be increased easily what makes
experimental setups scalable.

The number of applications of the module can be extended
by the use of different HDL designs for the FPGA. Currently
programs are available for counters, counting rates up to
150 MHz, pre-scaler, I/O-registers and a complex veto trigger
system. Other functions known from NIM modules can be
easily implemented presuming knowledge of a HDL. Further
applications are supported by the fact that eight inputs can be

used as outputs. For precise timing applications an oven heated
oscillator is mounted to the board. It delivers 40 MHz with
accuracy of 1 ppm [7].

VI. USE AT COMPASS

TRILOMO is used in the NA58 experiment (COMPASS [8])
at CERN as a veto counter to suppress halo particles of the
muon beam. The module is connected to detectors sensitive
to the sorrounding beam area in front of a ﬁxed target. The
module blocks trigger signals which are time correlated with
halo muons missing the target. High trigger rates demand a
precise time correlation what the module is suitable for.

The functionality of the module demanded by the experiment
has been achieved with a rewritten VHDL program which
adapts the module to an input register. High input rates up
to 100 MHz have been measured.

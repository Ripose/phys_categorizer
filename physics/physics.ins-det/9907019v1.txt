Abstract

An intense 146 M eV /c pion beam was stopped inside a scintillating ﬁber detector
made out of 12 planes with 16 pixels each, where every pixel consists out of 8 × 8
scintillating ﬁbers of 500 µm diameter dense packed. The detector was irradiated for
52 hours to more than 1 Mrad at its center. Before and directly after the irradiation
the detector has been exposed to a particle beam to compare the corresponding light
output. This study was continued during the following three months using cosmic
rays. No damage was found taking into account the measurement errors of 5-10 %.
In contrast a 9 cm deep lucite degrader became irreversibly non-transparent in the
irradiation region.

1 Introduction

During the last years there was a wide discussion about the use of diﬀerent
scintillator and ﬁber materials in high luminosity environments for tracking
and calorimetric applications for new collider and ﬁxed target experiments.
Extensive radiation hardness studies for these materials have been carried out
to investigate various quantities relevant for the problem. An introduction to
the ﬁeld is given in [1] whereas selected results of several groups are quoted in
[2]-[15].

Due to the large number of relevant parameters, the published results do not
give a clear and conclusive picture of the subject. This is true also for our
own investigations which were connected with the development of a scintil-
lating ﬁber detector as backup solution for the HERA-B inner tracker [16].

particles (p,e) at low and high dose rates gave rather diﬀerent results [11],
[12]-[15]

First of all the material under study is important concerning the basic polymer
and the diﬀerent dyes used to shift scintillation light into the visible region
of the spectrum. Decreases of light emission and transparency are observed
under irradiation. It is well known that Polystyrene and PVT are much more
radiation hard than PMMA and green shifting dyes give better results than
blue ones. It seems, however, that the kind of production (e.g.polymerization
time) can be important as well as temperature and atmospheric eﬀects during
transport, storage and machining [3,10].

An increase of the total dose rate normally will increase the damage of the
material under study. However, on an absolute scale results are diﬀerent even
for the same substances. Whereas damages are observed in some cases already
at some 10 krad [9,10] other studies show considerable eﬀects only above 1
Mrad [11,12]. In situ observations seem to indicate a change of the damage
mechanism above this dose at least for speciﬁc materials [14].

Very often a recovery of the light emission and transparency has been reported
after the irradiation. Recovery times of some days [4,6,14], several weeks [12]
or even months [9] have been observed. However, for the same material total
[12] and no recovery [11] is reported.

The presence of oxygen during and after the irradiation seems to be of partic-
ular importance for the damage and recovery of materials. Parameters related
to this question are dose rate, surrounding atmosphere and coverage (glue).
Published results are again inconsistent. In [2] it was measured that low dose
rates in air produce larger damages than large ones. This was interpreted to
be due to a better possibility for oxygen diﬀusion in the material during longer
times. The same was observed in [15] for doses below 1 Mrad. At about that
value however the same damage was found. Nearly no eﬀect was seen for low
rates in [13].

If oxygen diﬀusion is important one would expect an inﬂuence if air is kept
oﬀ the material surfaces. No diﬀerences were observed for irradiation in air
and nitrogen in [4,13]. In contrast larger eﬀects for irradiation in argon [10]
and nitrogen [11] were stated. Non-glued ﬁbers were found to be less damaged
compared to glued ones [11] opposite to the measurements reported in [12,13].

All the above results underline that one is far away from a consistent under-
standing of radiation damage mechanisms in scintillator and ﬁber materials. In
addition to the large ﬁeld of parameters, measurements are diﬃcult to perform.
General problems are dose determination for small probes, low light signals
and mechanical damages of fragile objects during repeated measurements.

In order to estimate the radiation hardness of a detector of preselected ma-
terial one should therefore irradiate a ﬁnite size prototype close to the later
experimental conditions. For the SCSF-78M ﬁbers selected to build a high
rate tracking detector [11,16] and a fast active target [17] we made such a test
using 146 MeV/c pion beams at the Swiss Paul-Scherrer Institute (PSI).

2 Detector setup and readout

Most of the following activities were done in close cooperation with the FAST-
collaboration [17]. In a common test run at PSI radiation hardness studies were
performed as well as ﬁrst proofs of ideas for the precise measurement of the
muon lifetime using a fast active scintillating ﬁber target.

Two detectors - µF AST I and II - have been used for radiation hardness tests.
Both were produced at DESY Zeuthen with the winding technology [16]. A
drum grooved with a pitch of 510 µm has been used to produce detector planes
consisting of 8 ﬁber layers of 16 × 8 KURARAY SCSF-78M double clad ﬁbers
of 500 µm diameter dense packed. White acrylic paint has been taken to glue
all ﬁbers of a plane together over a length of about 10 cm. One plane has an
eﬀective width of 66 mm and a depth of 3.6 mm. Twelve of these planes were
glued on top of each other to build the ﬁnal detector.

A photo of µF AST I is displayed in ﬁg. 1. The bottom side of the detector
was polished and mirrored by an aluminium foil. The other end consists of
30 cm loose ﬁbers. 8 × 8 ﬁbers of a plane were combined to form a macroscopic
pixel. Using a plastic connector mask the 16 pixels of a plane were put to a 16
channel multianode photomultiplier Hamamatsu R5900-M16. The 192 pixels
of the detector are readout in parallel using 12 such devices.

For µF AST II both ends of the glued ﬁbers were cut and polished. This
allows to look through the ﬁbers and visually to inspect their quality. A cor-
responding photo is shown in ﬁg. 2. The readout of the detector pixels of the
same size as in µF AST I is done here by clear optical light guides. Using
500 µm double clad KURARAY clear ﬁbers exactly the same planes are pro-
duced as for scintillating ﬁbers with the same winding drum. Polished at one
end of the about 5 cm long glued part, the 30 cm long loose ends are again
ordered to macro-pixels of 8 × 8 ﬁbers feed in masks ﬁtting to the same mul-
tianode photomultipliers as mentioned above. Only four planes of this type
were available and glued together to a compact block. Using pins and holes this
block could be connected with moderate precision to all parts of the µF AST
II scintillator block.

During the test run the FAST DAQ system has been used to study light

3

signals from particles hitting µF AST I or II. The signals from the 192 pho-
tomultiplier channels were splitted passively. After a beam trigger the arrival
time of all signals appearing in an interval of ± 20 µsec were registrated by
two VME-TDC’s CAEN V767. In addition 42 PM channels were connected to
the channels of six VME ADC’s LECROY 1182 to measure signal amplitudes
within a gate of 30 nsec after the beam trigger. The detector planes were
arranged perpendicular to the incoming beam deﬁning the z-direction. The
pixels in a plane have increasing row numbers in y-direction. ADC-channels
were connected to all planes of row numbers 8 and 9 and planes 4-12 in row
numbers 7 and 10 (see also ﬁg. 2).

At DESY Zeuthen µF AST II has been studied during three months after the
test run using a cosmic ray trigger to activate a VME ADC CAEN V265 for
registration of the PM-signal of particular pixels of the detector.

3 Measurements at PSI

The basic idea for the irradiation test was to stop an intense pion beam in
the center of one of the µF AST detectors. Due to the strong increase of the
pion ionization loss near to its stopping point it should be possible to irradiate
diﬀerent detector planes with diﬀerent but correlated and calculable doses.

The concept has been tested in a low intensity positive charged particle beam
of the πM1 area at PSI which is expected to contain mainly pions. The beam
momentum was selected to be 146 MeV/c. The setup is shown schematically in
ﬁg 3a. Beam particles ﬁrst cross a 8.5 cm thick lucite degrader (D) then a beam
trigger system of three plastic scintillators (T1-T3) of 0.5 cm thickness each
and hit ﬁnally the planes of the detectors µF AST I or II perpendicularly. Using
µF AST I half a million triggers have been recorded for radiation hardness
studies with a data rate of about 100 Hz.

As came out later 80 % of all triggers were due to minimum ionizing particles
(positrons) crossing all detector planes. These triggers were used to calibrate
the 12 photomultipliers to give the same signals for any plane. The corre-
sponding energy loss spectrum is shown in ﬁg. 4a.

Pions entering the detector were already non-relativistic and gave rise to larger
energy losses (ﬁg. 4b) increasing to the stopping point (ﬁg. 4c). Comparing
the average values of the three distributions a ratio of 1.0/2.7/5.6 is found. As
required, the pions stop dominantly in the center of the detector (see ﬁg. 5).

3.1 Irradiation scheme

A high intense charged pion beam of the area πE3 of PSI has been used for a
passive irradiation of the µF AST II scintillator block selecting the same mo-
mentum of 146 MeV/c as in πM1. The corresponding arrangement is sketched
in ﬁg. 3b. The beam crosses a 9.0 cm thick lucite degrader (D). The beam
proﬁle is measured using a transparent wire chamber (C). The beam rate is
monitored by two 0.5 cm thick scintillation counters (T1-T2). Finally particles
enter the detector which was surrounded by a lead shield otherwise.

Because the scintillation counters could operate only up to moderate particle
rates the PSI proton accelerator intensity was reduced for a short time by
a factor 19.2 to measure the particle ﬂux in our beam conﬁguration. It was
assumed that a linear scaling to the nominal accelerator intensity is possible
also for the πE3 area. With that procedure we measured a particle ﬂux of
0.9 × 108 particles cm−2· sec−1 in a 2 × 1 cm2 peak region of the beam proﬁle,
illuminating the six central channels (6 - 11) of the detector in about 5 cm
height. Within a total irradiation time of 186000 sec ( 51h 40′) 1.67 × 1013
particles/cm2 hit that detector region in total.

To estimate the corresponding radiation dose per detector plane the particle
content of the beam becomes important. With the available setup it could not
be measured for the conditions in πE3. In contrast to the situation in πM1
where the beam collimators were nearly closed, they were completely opened
here what should decrease positron appearance.

In ﬁg. 6a the average energy loss in the detector planes as measured with
µF AST I in πM1 is distributed for pions and positrons. Fig. 6b shows the part
of incoming pions crossing a detector plane or stopping there. Together with
the total particle ﬂux this numbers allow to estimate the integral irradiation
dose per detector plane. To do that a GEANT-based Monte Carlo was used to
simulate the experimental conditions and ﬁt the pion stopping distributions
in ﬁgs. 6b. The corresponding Monte Carlo result for the dose per plane is
displayed in ﬁg. 6c if the beam consists only of pions or positrons and for the
particle mixture found for the measurement in πM1. Planes 4 and 5 have been
irradiated correspondingly with a dose beetween 1 - 4 Mrad.

3.2 Irradiation damage

When the irradiation was ﬁnished ﬁrst a visual inspection of the degrader and
the µF AST II detector was made.

As visible in ﬁg. 7 the degrader showed a clear damage in the region where the

5

intense beam was crossing. The degrader is made out of two blocks pressed
strongly together with screws. Both blocks arise from the same piece of lucite
of 5 cm thickness. The second one was machined down to 4 cm a few hours
before the irradiation started. During that procedure the block was warmed
up considerably. This circumstance seems to be reﬂected in an interesting way
in the damage proﬁle. Beam particle hitting the blocks from left produce in
the ﬁrst one a brown zone which becomes smaller and weaker near to its end.
At the entrance of the second block however a kind of phase transition seems
to happen. Much stronger browning is observed. The widening of the proﬁle
is due to increasing multiple scattering of pions slowing down. The damage
seems to be irreversible. After three months no change of the transparency
has been observed.

In contrast to the strong eﬀect for the degrader no visible change of the trans-
parency of the µF AST II detector ﬁbers was seen.

The detector has been studied in addition to µF AST I before and after irra-
diation in the πM1 particle beam. However only planes 2-5 were readout with
the optical light guide planes described in section 2. In table 1 the ratio R1 of
the average values of the ADC-spectra for this planes measured with µF AST
II and I is given. A light loss of about 20 % is observed for the clear light
guides due to connector coupling losses because no ﬁber-by-ﬁber coupling is
possible.

The ratio R2 of the average values of ADC-spectra measured with µF AST II
after and before the irradiation is also shown in the table. It comes out to be
near to unity, demonstrating that no clear radiation damage is appearing for
the considered detector region. One would, however, like to prove whether the
shape of the corresponding spectra remains unchanged too. That is shown in
ﬁg. 8, where the ratio R3 of the two sum spectra is distributed for the region
of reasonable statistics of the data. All values are consistent with one within
their errors, giving an average < R3 > which allows a decrease of the observed
light signal of less than 10 % due to irradiation.

4 Laboratory measurements with cosmic rays

To check the long term behavior of the irradiated µF AST II detector for all its
twelve planes, the detector was studied using a cosmic ray particle trigger in
the DESY Zeuthen laboratory during three months. The detector planes were
placed perpendicular to the zenith axis in a black box. On top of the ﬁrst plane
a scintillation counter allowed to measure at diﬀerent positions along the ﬁbers.
The complete trigger was made by a threefold coincidence of this counter and
signals from two planes directly before and/or after the measured one. For

6

every plane pixel 9 was selected for trigger and measurement. To study any
plane of µF AST II, the light guide block step by step was moved across the
planes. Repeated measurements of the same pixel were done therefore often
with diﬀerent photomultipliers. For this purpose the PM’s were calibrated
using a constant LED light signal.

In ﬁg. 9 the results of all measurements are distributed versus the plane num-
ber and a rough order in time. In contrast to the impression from the ﬁrst
measurement no dependence on the plane number is observed. As can be seen
from ﬁg. 10 all data points follow a gaussian distribution.

Due to lack of time, only a single measurement has been done before irradiation
in plane 11. It ﬁts to the gaussian behavior of all data.

In ﬁg. 11 the average values of the measurements per plane are shown together
with a total average and its one and three sigma region. The single data point
from before irradiation agrees with that average in 1.4 σ.

5 Summary

A low energy high rate beam of positive pions has been stopped in the center of
a ﬁber detector made out of 12 planes with 16 pixels each. The ﬁbers are glued
together with white acrylic paint. Every pixel consists of 8 × 8 KURARAY
SCSF-78M ﬁbers of 500 µm diameter.

Within about 52 hours a total dose of 1 - 4 Mrad has been placed in the
detector center with a rate of 20 - 80 krad/h. The large error of this number
is due to a unknown positron contribution to the beam.

Unexpectedly, all measurements are consistent with no radiation damage of
any ﬁber detector plane. However, a large and irreversible damage (browning)
reﬂecting the proﬁle of the crossing beam is observed for the lucite degrader
placed in front of the detector. Within the measurement errors we can not
exclude a maximum decrease of 10 % of the light signals of detector ﬁbers after
irradiation. If present, no recovery has been observed during three months.

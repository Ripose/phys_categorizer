We present recent results of an extensive aging test, performed at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility
on two single–gap RPC prototypes, developed for the LHCb Muon System. With a method based on a model
describing the behaviour of an RPC under high particle ﬂux conditions, we have periodically measured the
electrode resistance R of the two RPC prototypes over three years: we observe a large spontaneous increase of R
with time, from the initial value of about 2 MΩ to more than 250 MΩ. A corresponding degradation of the RPC
rate capabilities, from more than 3 kHz/cm2 to less than 0.15 kHz/cm2 is also found.

1. INTRODUCTION

Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors have
been proposed to cover a large fraction (about
48%) of the Muon System [1,2] of the LHCb ex-
periment [3]. The LHCb apparatus covers the
forward part of the solid angle and is therefore
subject to a very large particle ﬂux. In particu-
lar, the particle rates expected in the Muon Sys-
tem are signiﬁcantly larger than those expected
in the corresponding sub–detectors in ATLAS [4]
and CMS experiments [5]. In the regions covered
by RPCs, the maximum particle rate is expected
to vary between 0.25 and 0.75 kHz/cm2, depend-
ing mainly on the polar angle. To cope with such
high rates, LHCb RPCs are operated in avalanche
mode [6,7,8], allowing to obtain a rate capability
up to some kHz/cm2 [9,10,11,12]. In these condi-
tions, the rate capability of an RPC is determined
by the volume resistivity ρ of the electrodes and
scales roughly as 1/ρ. For this reason, RPCs used
in experiments working at high rates are gener-
ally built with bakelite electrodes, that can be
produced with resistivities as low as 109 Ωcm.

Variations of the electrode resistivity aﬀect di-
rectly the rate capability of the RPCs: it is there-
fore very important to be able to monitor this
parameter during the chamber operation. These
variations can be due to changes in environmental
parameters like temperature and humidity [13,14]
or to possible aging eﬀects due to operating con-
ditions.

To study these eﬀects, we have devised, in the
framework of the aging studies for the LHCb
muon chambers, an extensive series of tests which
started in January 2001 and is expected to last
until December 2002, exploiting the large CERN
Gamma Irradiation Facility [15].

In this paper we present the latest results from
these studies. Results from a systematic series
of measurements of the resistivity of the bakelite
electrodes of two RPC prototypes are presented.
A study of the RPC rate capabilities is also dis-
cussed.

2. SETUP OF THE AGING TEST

The aging tests have been performed at the
Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) at CERN. The

2

GIF is a test area where particle detectors are
exposed to an adjustable photon ﬂux from an in-
tense 137Cs radioactive source with an activity of
about 655 GBq. A muon beam from the SPS ac-
celerator traverses the test area, so that various
measurements can be performed on detectors in
presence of the high background ﬂux of photons
from the source. In our case the source was also
used to perform an accelerated aging test of the
detectors [16]. A system of remotely controlled
ﬁlters allows us to vary the photon rate by four
orders of magnitude. The photon rate has been
found to depend from the ﬁlter absorption factor

Figure 1. Schematic view of the test setup (not to
scale). The positions of the RPCs corresponding
to the various measurements are indicated (1-3).
The distance of the RPC from the source in posi-
tion 1 was about 55 cm, and in position 3 about
140 cm. The scintillator counters (S1-S3 and the
Hodoscope) were used for measuring the RPC ef-
ﬁciency with the particle beam.

In our tests, two equal RPC detectors were
operated in the GIF area. The detectors (50 ×
50 cm2 with a 2 mm gas gap) were built using

bakelite plates (2 mm thick) of nominal resistivity
≈ 1010 Ωcm, and treated internally with linseed
oil.

Both detectors were

operated with the
same gas mixture, normally 95% C2H2F4, 4%
i − C4H10 and 1% SF6. High-voltage V0, gas mix-
ture composition, currents and temperature were
continuously monitored and recorded during all
the test period.

The test setup is schematically shown in Fig-
ure 1. Normally during the aging test one detec-
tor (RPC A) was placed in position 1, very close
to the source and almost continuously exposed
to radiation, whereas the second (RPC B) was
placed far from the source (position 2), to serve
as a reference.

Position 3 was used to perform eﬃciency mea-

the signals from the RPCs were read out on 3 cm
wide strips using fast electronics. A telescope of
scintillator counters, also shown in Figure 1, pro-
vided the trigger and a hodoscope measured the
particle position (x − y) with an accuracy better
than 1 cm. At the minimum source attenuation
the measured ﬂux density in Position 3 was about
1 kHz/cm2 [17].

3. BEHAVIOUR OF RPCs UNDER

HIGH FLUX CONDITIONS

We have observed that the current drawn by
RPC detectors subject to a high particle ﬂux,
shows a characteristic behaviour:

• it depends linearly on the applied voltage,

above a certain threshold;

• it saturates with increasing ﬂux values;

• it depends exponentially from the tempera-

ture at a ﬁxed applied voltage.

We have interpreted these eﬀects with a model,
described in details in [18]. In this model we as-
sume that the onset of the avalanche in the detec-
tor arises only above a threshold voltage VT . Due
to space charge eﬀects, the avalanche charge de-
pends linearly on the eﬀective voltage Vgap across
the gas gap: q ∝ Vgap − VT . Due to the volt-
age drop across the RPC electrodes, we have:

Vgap = V0 − IR, where V0 is the nominal ap-
plied voltage, I is the current drawn by the RPC
and R is the total volume resistance of the two
electrodes. The current I depends linearly on q
In
through the incident ﬂux Φ: I = Φq(Vgap).
the limit of inﬁnite ﬂux, in order to keep the cur-
rent ﬁnite, we should have Vgap = VT and in these
conditions we get a saturation value for the cur-
rent Imax = (V0 − VT )/R. At ﬁnite ﬂux values,
one obtains [18]:

where X ∝ ΦR and Reﬀ = R(1 + X)/X. Equa-
tion 1 is the central equation of the model:
it
shows that the current depends indeed linearly
from V0 and that it saturates at high ﬂux values
and incorporates the temperature dependence of
the current through the electrode resistance R.

Typical I −V0 curves of the two detectors under
test, taken for Abs = 1 are shown in Figure 2. A
perfect linearity is observed above the threshold
voltage VT (about 8500 V in this case). The re-
sistance R can thus be measured by ﬁtting these
curves with Equation 1 and obtaining the param-
eter X by measuring the RPC current at ﬁxed V0
for diﬀerent ﬂux values. In this way, the electrode
resistance can be measured in a non destructive
way and easily monitored during detector opera-
tion.

MEASUREMENTS

In the framework of the RPC aging tests,
we have performed a systematic set of measure-
ments of the RPC electrode resistances using the
method described above.

In order to compare measurements taken at dif-
ferent ambient temperatures T , we have rescaled
the values of R to 20◦C assuming an exponen-

measurement of R for the two RPCs at diﬀer-
ent temperatures. An exponential ﬁt gives an av-
erage temperature coeﬃcient of hαi = 0.126 ±
0.008 ◦C−1 in nice agreement with that obtained
for the bakelite slabs themselves. This conﬁrms
that R is indeed the volume resistance of the RPC
electrodes.

ﬁrst 200 days, RPC A was subject to an intense
photon ﬂux and integrated a charge of about 0.4
C/cm2 which corresponds to about 10 years of
operation in LHCb [16]. As shown in Figure 6
The current drawn by the detector decreased by
a factor of six in the same period. This behaviour
was interpreted as a corresponding increase of the
electrode resistance due to the current ﬂowing
through the electrodes themselves. This is in-
deed clearly visible in Figure 4. In the remain-

ing time, the chamber was again operated at the
GIF but, because of the large resistance, the cur-
rent drawn by the detector was negligible. Still,
a large increase of R by another factor four is ob-
served. This eﬀect is conﬁrmed by the measure-
ments performed on the prototype B (Figure 5)
that was exposed to the intense photon ﬂux only
for a short time. These results seem to indicate
that the resistivity of the bakelite electrodes tends
to spontaneously increase at a rate much larger
than that observed when the RPCs are subject
to the particle ﬂux expected in the LHCb exper-
iment. It is clear that this would be by far the
main aging eﬀect over 10 years of operation in
LHCb.

We don’t have yet a quantitative interpretation
of these phenomena, although we believe that this
is probably related to a decrease of water content
in the bakelite plates. While water evaporation
from the plates is always present, it is probably
enhanced both by the current ﬂowing in the elec-
trodes and by the ﬂux of dry gas in the chambers.

5. ANALYSIS OF RATE CAPABILITIES

The maximum incident particle rate that an
RPC can stand is roughly proportional to the
inverse of the electrode volume resistivity. It is
therefore essential to check what is the eﬀect of
the increase of the bakelite resistivity described

above on the detector rate capability. To study
quantitatively this eﬀect, we deﬁne the rate ca-
pability rmax of our prototypes as the maximum
rate where their eﬃciency is at least 95%, at a
maximum operating voltage of 10.6 kV (this guar-
antees a plateau of about 400 V below the thresh-
old of streamer regime). The results of three
beam tests performed over a three years period
are summarised in Table 1. In the 1999 test, the
maximum available particle rate at the GIF was
about 3 kHz/cm2 but, at this rate, the chamber
eﬃciency was well above 95%; the rate capability

m
e
6

was therefore much larger than 3 kHz/cm2. We
can clearly see that the rate capability is dropping
roughly as 1/R as expected. The rate capability
extrapolated to the latest measurements of R is
therefore about 0.15 kHz/cm2 which is well below
the rates foreseen in LHCb (> 0.25 kHz/cm2).
These results have recently brought the LHCb
collaboration to abandon the RPC technology for
the Muon System of the experiment.

We have developed and applied a method to
measure RPC electrode resistance R, on–line,
during chamber operations, in an easy and non
destructive way. Using this method we have stud-
ied extensively the aging eﬀects on bakelite RPCs.
We have observed an increase of R by two orders
of magnitude in about three years. Pure spon-
taneous aging is the dominant eﬀect. The RPC
rate capability dropped correspondingly from a
few kHz/cm2 to less than 0.15 kHz/cm2. These
results brought the LHCb collaboration to aban-
don the RPC technology for the Muon System of
the experiment.

Abstract

The STAR Silicon Strip Detector (SSD) completes the three layers of the Silicon Vertex
Tracker (SVT) to make an inner tracking system located inside the Time Projection Cham-
ber (TPC). This additional fourth layer provides two dimensional hit position and energy
loss measurements for charged particles, improving the extrapolation of TPC tracks through
SVT hits. To match the high multiplicity of central Au+Au collisions at RHIC the double
sided silicon strip technology was chosen which makes the SSD a half million channels de-
tector. Dedicated electronics have been designed for both readout and control. Also a novel
technique of bonding, the Tape Automated Bonding (TAB), was used to fullﬁll the large
number of bounds to be done. All aspects of the SSD are shortly described here and test per-
formances of produced detection modules as well as simulated results on hit reconstruction
are given.

1 Introduction

The STAR Silicon Strip Detector (SSD) [1] constitutes the fourth layer of the inner
tracking system. Installed between the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) and the Time
Projection Chamber (TPC), the SSD will enhance the tracking capabilities of the
STAR experiment by measuring accurately the two dimensional hit position and

energy loss of charged particles. It aims speciﬁcally at improving the extrapolation
of TPC tracks through SVT hits and increasing the average number of space points
measured near the collision thus increasing the detection efﬁciency of long-lived
meta-stable particles.

The SSD is placed at a distance of 230 mm from the beam axis, covering a pseudo-
rapidity range of |η| < 1.2 which leads to a total silicon surface close to 1 m2.

The design of the SSD is based on two clamshells, each containing 10 carbon-
ﬁber ladders. Each ladder (ﬁgure 1) supports 16 wafers using double-sided silicon
strip technology (768 strips per side) and connected to the front-end electronics
(6 ALICE 128C chips per side) by means of the Tape Automated Bonded (TAB)
technology [2]. The ladders are tilted with respect to their long axis, allowing the
overlap of the detectors in the transverse plane for better hermiticity and alignment
performances. A bus cable transports the analog signals along the ladder to two
10 bits ADC boards installed at both ends. After digitization, the signals are sent
to Readout Boards which are linked to the DAQ system through Giga-link optics
ﬁbers. The whole system is remotely controlled to monitor powers and temperature
but also to calibrate and tune the front-end electronics. The cooling system is based
on an air-ﬂow through the ladder which is embedded in a mylar sheet. The total
radiation length has been estimated to be around 1%.

2 Mechanics

The mechanical design is constrained by : 1) the inner radius of the TPC (including
a safety margin in order to avoid high voltage breaks from the TPC ﬁeld cage);
2) limited material budget; 3) stability with respect to temperature variations and
minimizatiuon of the sagging due the weight of the modules in order to insure
good alignment precision. Each ladder is 1060 mm long, featuring a triangular
cross-section of 40 mm base. The ladders are made of high-modulus carbon-ﬁber
which allows for both a good rigidity and a low material budget. The saggita of
a loaded ladder has been estimated by simulation to be lower than 100 µm. The
SSD modules are glued on the carbon ladder by an elastic epoxy glue in order to
accomodate the different thermal expansion coefﬁcients of silicon and carbon. Two
sets of ten ladders are assembled on C-shaped ribs which allow for installation on
the common SVT/SSD support structure.

3 Wafers

The design of the silicon wafers was inspired by the initial design of the ALICE
experiment silicon strip detector [4]. The wafers are 75 mm by 42 mm sized and
300 µm thick. The strips are oriented perpendicularly with respect to the longest di-
mension of the detector on both sides (double-sided technology), with a pitch of 95
µm (768 strips per side). The insulation between strips on the N side is achieved by
p-spraying, and the biasing scheme uses punch-through technology. The bias ring
surrounded by a guard ring deﬁne an active area of 73 mm by 40 mm. The strips
on the P and N sides are inclined by 35 mrad with respect to each other and symet-
rically with respect to the wafer edge. Combined with the charge correlation due
to the double-sided technology, this stereo angle allows an efﬁcient 2-dimension
impact point reconstruction in a high multiplicity environment with a low ambigu-
ity yield [5]. The pitch is chosen in order to achieve a minimum resolution (digital
resolution) of 30 µm in the transverse plane and 800µm along the Z axis. During
production, all the 440 detectors were fully characterized with a probe-station al-
lowing the measurement of their depletion voltage and leakage current (ﬁgure 2).
The detectors can currently be operated between 20 V and 50 V. Moreover, the cor-
responding 680000 strips have been scanned to identify every defective strips [10].
A very low average number of dead strips have been measured, well below 1%, see
ﬁgre 3. Prototypes were irradiated in order to test their capability to cope with the
expected ﬂuxes [7].

4 Front-end electronics and modules

Each of the 320 detection modules (ﬁgure 4) is composed of a silicon wafer,two
hybrid circuits (one per side) supporting the front-end electronics and a mechanical
structure [3]. The front-end electronics is constituted by six ALICE 128C chips per
side [8]. The ALICE 128C is a low power chip, specially designed for the STAR
and ALICE silicon strip detectors using the AMS 1.2 µm CMOS technology. Each
of the 128 analog input channels of the chips allows the ampliﬁcation, shaping and
storage of the charge collected on a single strip. The shaping time is adjustable be-
tween 1.2 and 2 µs, the dynamic range extends up to ±13 MIPs ( signals collected
on each side of the wafer have different polarity) with a nominal noise of 290 e +
8 e/pF . An analog mutiplexer allows the sequential readout of the data at a rate up

to 10 MHz.The chip is controlled through JTAG protocol in order to tune and mon-
itor remotely its performance. The front-end electronics is supported by a hybrid
circuit which is a copper printed kapton tape glued on a carbon stiffener. The main
components on the hybrids are ALICE128C chips and a COSTAR (COntrol STAR)
chip [9] designed for slow control purposes : temperature and leakage current mea-
surements as well as pedestal compensation. Tape Automated Bonding (TAB) is
used for the connection between the strips on the detector and the analog inputs
of the ALICE 128C chips [12]. This bumpless technology is based on a kapton
microcable on which are printed copper strips, the ﬂexibility of the cable allow-
ing the folding of the hybrids on top of the detector in order to make the detection
module very compact, see ﬁgure 5. Furthermore, this cable plays the role of a pitch
adaptator between the 95 µm pitch of the detector and the 44µm pitch of chips on
the hybrid. The TAB technology is also used for the connection between the chip
and the hybrid. During the production stage, the chip is ﬁrst connected to a TAB
tape and then fully tested [10] before its connection to the detector. An internal
pulser permits testing of all channels individually both during stages of assembly
and on the ﬁnal installation in STAR. After the assembly of modules, each strip is
calibrated with a dedicated laser test bench.

5 Readout electronics

The Control Board which receives the signals from the modules and also takes care
of JTAG communication and latchup protection is connected to the hybrid with a
kapton cable. The analog signals are transfered from the Control Board to the ADC
Board, both located at the end of the ladder (one set per side and per ladder). The
ADC board reads sequentially the data of a full ladder at 10 MHz and digitizes
to 10 bits. The analog signal (50 mV/MiP) spans a range of 1 V. The two piece
Control Board is joined with a ﬂex cable and folded to conform to the triangular
carbon ladder. The Control Board is connected to the ADC Board which is installed
at the bottom edge of the ladder. The interface between the detector (ADC, JTAG
control of the chips) and the STAR system (DAQ, Slow-control, trigger) is done
through four Readout Boards located on the TPC wheels. All the functionalities of
the Readout Board are performed by an FPGA programable chip. The system is
able to read all the channels in less than 5 ms.

6 Performances

The most important characteristics of the SSD are spatial resolution and detection
efﬁciency. The ﬁrst is driven by the pitch, the diffusion of the charge cloud in the
the wafer bulk, the signal to noise ratios and alignment accuracy. The efﬁciency
is determined by the fraction of dead strips on the detector and dead channels on
the ALICE 128C chips, the performance of the connection between the detector
and the front end electronics and signal-to-noise ratios. Prototypes of the detection
modules, as well as of the Control and ADC boards were tested off-line and in-beam
at CERN. Figure 6 shows typical histograms of signal-to-noise ratios obtained from
in-beam tests. The 2-D spatial resolution was estimated from the beam-test data by
reconstructing impact points on both sides of detectors and combining these infor-
mation. The values are around 15 µm in the r/φ direction ( ﬁgure 7)and 750 µm in
the direction along the strips (corresponding to the beam axis in STAR)[11]. These
spatial resolutions are driven by the intrinsic resolution on each side, which are typ-
ically of 20 µm and the stereo angle. Due to the quality of the selected detectors,
chips and to the TAB connection, one can expect a level of dead channels below
2% in average. This quality is achived through full tests of all the components at all
stages of the production and assembly phases : detector, chip, hybrid, module, lad-
der, clamshell. All information collected during these tests is stored in a database 1
which may be accessed at any time and from anywhere[13]. This database sys-
tem provides information for monitoring the production, selecting elements for the
assembly and eventually checking the status of the whole detector.

Fig. 6. Typical signal-to-noise distributions obtained with SSD prototypes.

A detailed simulation of the detector as well as a hit reconstruction algorithm have
been developped to evaluate the global performances of the SSD [6]. The method
uses the matching of the signal amplitudes on both side of the detector for the
same particle to solve ambiguous situation where several particle hits are close
together. In nominal conditions for the noise and the number of dead channels the
hit reconstruction reaches 95 % efﬁciency with 98 % purity. The dependence of the
efﬁciency on the noise level and the number of dead strips is pictured in ﬁgure 8.
The general trend is that the efﬁciency decreases steadily with the average number
of dead strips whereas it is much more stable with respect to the noise. The purity
is less sensitive to this condition and stays above 98% even for 10% dead strips or
4 times nominal noise level.

7 Summary

The Silicon Strip Detector for STAR with around 1 m2 of sensitive surface and
half a million channels is one of the largest one-layer system using the doubled
sided silicon strip technology, see summary table 1. A compact module design was
achieved by using a novel Tape Automated Bonding method to connect both sides
of the silicon wafers to the front end electronics. Other innovative solutions were
used like air ﬂow cooling and full remote control of the front-end electronics to
minimize the material budget and to handle the large amount of parameters needed
to operate the SSD.

Position resolutions of 15µm in the transverse to beam direction and 750µm in the
beam direction were measured with beam test. A full simulation with realistic noise
and dead channel conditions was performed and yelded a 95 % efﬁciency with 98 %
purity for hit reconstruction.

The detector is currently in production phase and will be installed in STAR in 2002.

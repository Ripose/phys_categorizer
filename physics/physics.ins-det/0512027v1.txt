Abstract

In this paper a detailed simulation of irradiated pixel sensors was used to investigate the eﬀects of radiation damage
on the position determination and optimize the hit reconstruction algorithms. The simulation implements a model
of radiation damage by including two defect levels with opposite charge states and trapping of charge carriers.
The simulation shows that a position resolution below 15 µm along the CMS r − φ plane can be achieved after an
irradiation ﬂuence of 5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2. In addition, we show that systematic errors in the position determination
can be largely reduced by applying η corrections.

1. Introduction

The CMS experiment, currently under construc-
tion at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will in-
clude a silicon pixel detector [1] to allow tracking
in the region closest to the interaction point. The
detector will be a key component for reconstruct-
ing interaction vertices and heavy quark decays in
a particulary harsh environment, characterized by
a high track multiplicity and heavy irradiation. At
the full LHC luminosity the innermost layer, with
a radius of 4.3 cm, will be exposed to a particle
ﬂuence of 3 × 1014 neq/cm2/yr.

In order to evaluate the eﬀects of irradiation and
optimize the algorithms for the position determi-
nation a detailed simulation of the pixel sensors
was implemented. In [2] we have proved that it is
possible to adequately describe the charge collec-

tion characteristics of a heavily irradiated silicon
detector in terms of a tuned double junction model
which produces a doubly peaked electric ﬁeld pro-
ﬁle across the sensor. The modeling is supported
by the evidence of doubly peaked electric ﬁelds
obtained from beam test measurements and pre-
sented in [3]. The dependence of the modeled trap
concentrations upon ﬂuence was presented in [4]
and the temperature dependence of the model was
discussed in [5]. In this paper the simulation was
used to study the position determination in irradi-
ated pixel sensors.

This paper is organized as follows: the sensor
simulation is described in Section 2, in Section 3 the
determination of the hit position in irradiated pixel
sensors is discussed. The results are presented in
Section 4 and the conclusions are given is Section 5.

2. Sensor simulation

The results presented in this paper rely upon a
detailed sensor simulation that includes the mod-
eling of irradiation eﬀects in silicon. The simula-
tion, pixelav [2, 6, 7], incorporates the following
elements: an accurate model of charge deposition
by primary hadronic tracks (in particular to model
delta rays); a realistic 3-D intra-pixel electric ﬁeld
map; an established model of charge drift physics
including mobilities, Hall Eﬀect, and 3-D diﬀusion;
a simulation of charge trapping and the signal in-
duced from trapped charge; and a simulation of
electronic noise, response, and threshold eﬀects.
The intra-pixel electric ﬁeld map was generated
using tcad 9.0 [8] to simultaneously solve Pois-
son’s Equation, the carrier continuity equations,
and various charge transport models.

The simulated devices correspond to the base-
line sensor design for the CMS barrel pixel detec-
tor. The sensors are “n-in-n” devices, designed to
collect charge from n+ structures implanted into
n- bulk silicon. The simulated samples were 22x32
arrays of 100x150 µm2 pixels. The substrate was
285 µm thick, n-doped silicon. The donor concen-
tration was set to 1.2 × 1012 cm−3 corresponding
to a depletion voltage of about 75 V for an unir-
radiated device. The 4 T magnetic ﬁeld was set as
in the CMS conﬁguration and the sensor temper-
ature to -10◦ C. The simulation did not include
the “punch-through” structure on the n+ implants
which is used to provide a high resistance connec-
tion to ground and to provide the possibility of on-
wafer IV measurements.

The eﬀect of irradiation was implemented in the
tcad simulation by including two defect levels in
the forbidden silicon bandgap with opposite charge
states and trapping of charge carriers. The activa-
tion energies of the donor and acceptor traps were
set to (EV + 0.48) eV and (EC − 0.525) eV, re-
spectively, where EV and EC are the valence and
conduction band energy level, respectively. The
trap densities and the capture cross sections for
electrons and holes were obtained by ﬁtting the
model to beam test data as described in [2,4]. The
simulated irradiation ﬂuences were Φ = 2 × 1014
neq/cm2 and Φ = 5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2 and the re-

verse bias was set to 200 V and 300 V, respectively.
The electric ﬁeld proﬁle as function of the sen-
sor depth is shown in Fig. 1(a). The ﬁeld has max-
ima at the detector implants and a minimum near
the midplane which shifts towards the p+ implant
at lower ﬂuences. The dependence of the space
charge density upon the detector depth is shown
in Fig. 1(b). Before irradiation the sensor is char-
acterized by a constant and positive space charge
density across the sensor bulk. At a ﬂuence Φ =
2 × 1014 neq/cm2 the device shows a negative space
charge of about −6 × 1013 cm−3 for most of its
thickness, a compensated region corresponding to
the electric ﬁeld minimum and a positive space
charge density close to the backplane. The space
charge density and electric ﬁeld near the p+ im-
plant increase with the irradiation ﬂuence.

and space charge density (b), resulting from the two-trap
model, are shown as a function of z for unirradiated and
irradiated devices.

3. Hit reconstruction

The spatial resolution of the pixel sensors is
mainly determined by the readout pitch and charge
sharing between neighboring cells. Pixels have a
weak capacitive coupling and charge sharing is
mainly due to diﬀusion and drift of charge carriers
under the combined eﬀect of the magnetic and
electric ﬁelds. After irradiation, free carriers trap-
ping produces an inhomogeneous charge collection
across the bulk and charge sharing between neigh-
boring pixels becomes strongly non linear on the
impact position. In addition, the beneﬁcial eﬀect

2

of the Lorentz deﬂection is reduced when a higher
bias voltage is applied to provide a suﬃcient drift
ﬁeld. In what follows we discuss measurements of
the sensor spatial resolution along the r − φ di-
rection, where the charge drift is aﬀected by the
Lorentz deﬂection.

To reconstruct hits pixels with charge above
2000 electrons were selected and clusters were
formed by adjacent pixels above threshold. Both
side and corner adjacent pixels were included in
the cluster. In addition, clusters adjacent to the
matrix border were excluded. Figure 2 shows the
deﬁnition of the track impact angle α with respect
to the sensor plane along the x direction. The
track is orthogonal to the sensor plane along the
axis orthogonal to x. The magnetic ﬁeld produces
a Lorentz shift L = T tan(ΘL) towards the right
direction. Thus, the total charge width is given by

W = L − T tan(α).

(1)

The cluster is projected along the x axis by sum-
ming the charge collected in the pixels with the
same x coordinate. If the cluster is given by a single
pixel its position is given by the pixel center. For
larger clusters the hit position is calculated with a
center-of-gravity algorithm.

verse plane.

To further improve the spatial resolution for
events in which charge is shared among several
pixels the so-called η-correction is introduced [9].
As we will discuss, the correction is particularly
eﬀective on irradiated devices, where the eﬀects
of inhomogeneous charge collection are larger. As-
suming that the number of particles crossing the
sensor is uniformely distributed along x we should
expect the reconstructed position within a pixel
to be uniformely distributed. We deﬁne η as the
non-integer part of the reconstructed position.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of η for all events,
where η = 0 corresponds to the center of the pixel
cell and η = ±0.5 to the borders. The measured
distribution is almost ﬂat in the pixel regions
closer to the pixel borders and it shows a dip at
the center. The peak at η = 0 is due to single pixel
clusters. For each η we associate a corrected value
given by the function

F (η) =

η
−0.5 dN/d¯η d¯η
R

−0.5 dN/d¯η d¯η
R

where η is in pixel units. The F (η) function is
shown in Fig. 3. The corrected position is calcu-
lated by adding F (η) to the integer part of the re-
constructed position.

4. Cluster size and position resolution

Figure 4 shows the fraction of events for diﬀerent
cluster sizes as function of the impact angle α and
for diﬀerent irradiation ﬂuences. At negative angles
the Lorentz shift and the geometrical sharing term
sum up giving large W values. For perpendicular
tracks (α = 0◦) the total charge width is given by
the Lorentz shift and then decreases for α > 0◦.
Clusters are larger than one pixel in the majority
of cases, however at high irradiation ﬂuences the
higher bias voltage produces a narrower Lorentz
deﬂection and, consequently, a smaller cluster size.
The combination of carrier trapping and higher
bias voltage produces smaller cluster sizes after
heavy irradiation. The average cluster size for an
unirradiated detector with Vbias=200 V and per-
pendicular tracks is 2.0. After a ﬂuence of Φ =
5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2 and Vbias=300 V the value is
1.8.

The position resolution was estimated by com-
paring the hit position, xrec, reconstructed as de-
scribed in Section 3 with the true impact position,
xtrue, generated by the simulation. The residuals
were deﬁned as xres = xrec −xtrue and the position
resolution was given by the width of a Gaussian ﬁt
of the residual distribution. The position resolution
for tracks perpendicular to the sensor is summa-
rized in Table 1 for clusters of two pixels. The posi-
tion resolution for all events is shown in the last col-

tion resolution below 15 µm can be achieved even
after heavy irradiation. In addition, the precision
can be improved by correcting the reconstructed
position as described in Section 3.

The size of the η corrections become particu-
larly signiﬁcant after irradiation and for narrow

charge widths. Figure 5 shows the residuals distri-
bution for clusters of two pixels, simulated for a
sensor irradiated to Φ = 5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2 and

correction (Fig. 5(a)) is not described by a single
Gaussian and is aﬀected by large systematic errors
which depend on the interpixel hit position. The
distribution in Fig. 5(b) shows that the systematic

5. Conclusions

In this paper a detailed simulation of the sili-
con pixel sensors for the CMS tracker was used
to estimate the eﬀects of radiation damage on the
position resolution. The simulation, incorporating
a double junction model of radiation damage and
trapping of charge carriers, provides a good de-
scription of the charge collection measurements
in the ﬂuence range from 0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2 to
5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2.

The simulation shows that a position resolution
below 15 µm can be achieved for perpendicular
tracks in the CMS trasverse plane even after heavy
irradiation. In addition, we show that the position
resolution can be improved by applying η correc-
tions.

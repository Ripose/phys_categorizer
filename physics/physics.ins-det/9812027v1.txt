Abstract

We present a procedure for the design and construction of
a passive, multipole, mechanical high–stop vibration isolator.
The isolator, consisting of a stack of metal disks connected by
thin wires, attenuates frequencies in the kilohertz range, and
is suited to both vacuum and cryogenic environments. We
derive an approximate analytical model and compare its pre-
dictions for the frequencies of the normal modes to those of a
ﬁnite element analysis. The analytical model is exact for the
modes involving only motion along and rotation about the
longitudinal axis, and it gives a good approximate descrip-
tion of the transverse modes. These results show that the
high–frequency behavior of a multi–stage isolator is well char-
acterized by the natural frequencies of a single stage. From
the single–stage frequency formulae, we derive relationships
among the various geometrical parameters of the isolator to
guarantee equal attenuation in all degrees of freedom. We
then derive expressions for the attenuation attainable with a
given isolator length, and ﬁnd that the most important lim-
iting factor is the elastic limit of the spring wire material.
For our application, which requires attenuations of 250 dB
at 1 kHz, our model speciﬁes a six–stage design using brass
disks of approximately 2 cm in both radius and thickness,
connected by 3 cm steel wires of diameters ranging from 25
to 75 µm. We describe the construction of this isolator in
detail, and compare measurements of the natural frequencies
of a single stage with calculations from the analytical model
and the ﬁnite element package. For translations along and
rotations about the longitudinal axes, all three results are in
agreement to within 10% accuracy.

I. INTRODUCTION

A Taber vibration isolator (TVI) is a passive, multi-
pole, mechanical high-stop ﬁlter for vibration isolation
at audio frequencies.1 It provides isolation in six degrees
of freedom and may reach attenuations of 200–300 dB
for all motions. TVIs can be made completely metallic
and hence suitable to both cryogenic and vacuum envi-
ronments.

The TVI was invented by R. C. Taber for use with
resonant–mass gravitational wave antennas.2 These ex-
periments typically involve a massive, well–isolated,
high–Q resonator with a fundamental frequency near 1
kHz. The original application used the TVI to attenuate

1

vibrations transmitted by wiring leading to the massive
resonator. In our application, TVIs are used in an ap-
paratus designed to detect gravitational–strength forces
between test masses separated by distances less than 1
mm.3,4 Speciﬁcally, the TVIs support the test masses,
which are centimeter–scale, 1 kHz mechanical oscillators,
similar in design to those developed at Bell Labs and Cor-
nell for use in condensed matter physics experiments.5

Other types of passive, multipole, high-stop vibration
isolators have been described by Aldcroft, et al.6 and
Blair et al.,7 also in connection with resonant–mass grav-
itational wave antennas. A design involving elastomers
for use with laser interferometric gravitational wave de-
tectors has been described by Giaime, et al.8

The basic geometry of the TVI is shown in Fig. 1. It
consists of a vertical stack of cylindrical masses connected
by springs made from straight wires under tension. The
hexagonal arrangement (viewed from above) of the wire
attachment points gives the structure bending stiﬀness,
which raises the frequency of the pendulum–type modes.
With careful design, this arrangement can yield approx-
imately equal attenuation in all six degrees of freedom.
For the particular design developed below, the cylindrical
brass masses are on the centimeter scale, and the springs
are made of steel wires with diameters of tens of microns.

Sec. II presents an approximate analytical model of a
TVI. The model yields simple formulae for the natural
frequencies of an isolator with a single spring–mass pair
(or “stage”), and an accurate solution for the normal
modes of a complete isolation stack. Sec. III presents
a numerical analysis of the normal modes of a multi–
stage isolator and shows that the results agree very well
with the analytical model. Sec. IV uses the single–stage
natural frequency formulae to optimize the design of a
multi–stage isolator for uniform attenuation in all degrees
of freedom, given the speciﬁc geometrical constraint of
ﬁnite stack length. The subsequent predictions for the
number of stages and for the spring wire diameter are
used to construct an actual TVI, which is described in
Sec. V. The measurements of the natural frequencies of
a single stage are compared with calculations from the
analytical model and the numerical analysis.

II. APPROXIMATE ANALYTICAL MODEL

The analytical model of the TVI is based on a combi-
nation of the lumped–element one–dimensional spring–
mass chain shown in Fig. 2, and the single stage in Fig. 3.

stage. The displacement of each stage with respect to
that immediately above is then simply another factor of
(ω0/ω)2, so that the attenuation in displacement from
the support to the nth suspended mass, for one DOF,
is given by (ω0/ω)2n. The extremely rapid dependence
of the attenuation on frequency is, of course, the reason
why multi-stage isolators are so eﬀective.

FIG. 1. Basic geometry of six-stage Taber vibration isola-

tor.

This model is exact for translations along and rotations
about the vertical axis, and, as shown below, it gives a
good approximation of the transverse motions as well.

A single stage with one degree of freedom (DOF) is
useful for understanding the attenuation of a multi-stage
isolator. If the spring is displaced at the top by a vibra-
tion of frequency ω (the frequency to be ﬁltered by the
isolator, or operating frequency) and amplitude x(ω), the
equation of motion for this system may be written:

mω2x0(ω) = k[x(ω)

where m is the mass, k is the spring constant, and x0(ω)

Here,

µth stage, and Ων is the frequency of the νth normal
mode. In the high frequency regime, this result reduces to
(ω0/ω)2n, for an isolator with identical stages (ωµ = ω0).
In order to use Eq. 3 to estimate the total attenuation
of the TVI for each DOF, the analytical model can be
used to approximate the single–stage frequencies ωµ and
to calculate the normal mode frequencies Ων. The ﬁrst
step is to derive the linear and torsional spring constants
for each DOF.

3 from the hexagonal geometry of the attachment
points. In general, if θ is the angle between a wire and the
direction of translation, the corresponding contribution
to the spring constant for that DOF is k = EA cos2 θ/l.
Referring again to Fig. 3, two wires per stage have an-
θa3 with respect to the 1-axis. Their contri-
gle (π/2)
bution to the corresponding spring constant is therefore
k = 2EAR2/l3. The remaining four wires each have an-
gle θb1 with respect to this axis, bringing the total spring
constant to kx1 = 3EAR2/l3.

−

Finally, from the ﬁgure, four wires per stage have angle
θb2 with respect to the 2-axis, so that their total contri-
bution to the spring constant is k = 3EAR2/l3. This
is the complete expression for kx2, since the remaining
two wires are orthogonal to the 2-axis. These results are
summarized in Table I.

Computation of the torsional spring constants is sim-
pliﬁed by expressing the inﬁnitesimal torques dτj about
each axis in terms of the inﬁnitesimal displacements dxj
of the attachment points. If dφj is the inﬁnitesimal rota-
tion of the eﬀective lever arm rk about the jth axis, we
have, for each wire on the stage:

FIG. 3. Single TVI stage with parameters used for calcu-

lation of spring constants.

A. Spring Constants

Using the axes deﬁned in Fig. 3, the normal modes
of the TVI are modeled as pure translations along and
rotations about the 1-, 2-, and 3-axes. This is an approx-
imation because in reality the 1- and 2- translations and
rotations are coupled. The evaluation of the spring con-
stant for translation along the 3-axis is the most straight-
forward. In Fig. 3, θa3 is the angle between the 3-axis
and wire a, x3 is the equilibrium spacing between any two
stages, l is the length of the wire, A is the cross-sectional
area of the wire, and E is the modulus of elasticity of
the wire. In this analysis, each of these parameters is as-
sumed to have a unique value for a particular stage. Since
the basic geometry of all stages is the same, however, the
functional form of the spring constants for each stage is
also the same. The stage subscript, µ, can therefore be
dropped to economize the notation. The relationship be-
tween an inﬁnitesimal force dF along a spring wire and
displacement dl is then:

For an initial longitudinal displacement dx3, the displace-
ment along the wire is:

the moment of inertia of the disk about the 3-axis, and
Iτ1 = Iτ2 = mR2(1 + (t/R)2/3)/4 is the moment about
the 1- and 2-axes, where t is the disk thickness. The nat-
ural frequencies for each DOF are included in Table I.

p

For each DOF, the normal mode frequencies Ων
must be calculated in a complete solution to the one–
dimensional lumped–element spring–mass chain in Fig. 2.
The choice of six stages for the model, while technically
arbitrary at this point, is motivated by the results of
the design optimization in Sec. IV. The analytical solu-
tion leads to a twelfth–order polynomial in ω for trans-
lation or rotation in the relevant coordinate. The nor-
mal mode frequencies Ων are computed by substituting
the expressions for the spring constants in Table I into
the characteristic equation and ﬁnding the roots numer-
ically. The parameters entering into the characteristic
equation (mass radii and thickness, wire length, diame-
ter, and elastic modulus) also derive from the results of
the optimization procedure in Sec. IV, and are listed in
Tables II and III. The frequencies are plotted in Figs. 4
and 5. The twelve translational frequencies and twelve
rotational frequencies for the 1- and 2-axes are two–fold
degenerate.

Fig. 6 shows the transfer function evaluated for the
case of six stages and ωµ = ω0 for each stage. The high-
est normal mode frequency is close to 2ω0 (this would be
exact for an inﬁnite chain), and the asymptotic attenua-
tion is nearly reached at ω

3ω0.

≈

The single–stage natural frequency ω0 nearly com-
pletely characterizes the behavior of a multi-stage TVI
with identical stages. This frequency depends on the
design parameters of the TVI in a simple and explicit
way, and therefore can be used directly for design opti-
mization. Before discussing optimization, the analytical
model is compared to a numerical analysis.

III. FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS

A numerical model of a six stage TVI is constructed
using the ANSYS9 ﬁnite element analysis software pack-
age. Rigid bodies with six DOF model the brass disks,
and elastic beams, also with six DOF, model the steel
wires. The beams are arranged in the geometry of the
wires in Fig. 3, and are coupled rigidly at their endpoints
to the point masses representing the disks. In addition to
mass, the required input parameters for the point masses
include the moments of inertia for each rotational DOF.
The required input parameters for the beams include
density and modulus of elasticity. All input parameters
are derived from the data in Tables II and III.

The frequencies of the 36 normal modes calculated by
ANSYS are compared to the frequency calculations from
the analytical model in Figs. 4 and 5. The results in
Fig. 4 show that the analytical model is exact for trans-
lations along and rotations about the 3-axis. In Fig. 5,
remaining frequencies calculated in ANSYS are arranged

by mode number (upper axis). The results from the an-
alytical model are arranged by increasing frequency for
each DOF. The plot illustrates that the true normal mode
frequencies fall between the uncoupled translation and
rotation frequencies found analytically.

This analysis suggests that the approximate analytical
model of the TVI is suﬃciently accurate for use in the
development of a working design. Furthermore, for an
isolator with identical stages operating in the high fre-
quency domain, the single–stage resonant frequency ω0
for each DOF from the model is a suﬃcient parameter
with which to optimize the design.

IV. DESIGN OPTIMIZATION

From Eq. 3, the attenuation for a multi-stage isola-
tor is most strongly dependent on the number of stages,
n. While it is important to choose a suﬃcient number
of stages for the degree of attenuation desired, the maxi-
mization of n given the geometrical constraints of the sys-

tem must be balanced with at least two other important
factors. First, attention should be given to the extent to
which attenuation is desired in each DOF of the isolated
system. Second, it is essential that the transverse vibra-
tional modes of the spring wires be kept well above the
operational frequency, ω, so that the wires function as
simple springs.

A. Uniform Isolation in each DOF

The particular application in our laboratory requires
the isolation of vibrations in the kilohertz range in all
DOF. The normal modes for each DOF of the TVI should
therefore be essentially the same. Using the single–stage
analytical model, relations between the geometrical pa-
rameters of the TVI can be found by equating the natural
frequencies for each DOF.

From the expressions in Table I, the natural frequencies
ωx1,2 and ωτ3 always diﬀer by a factor of √3. Taking an
approximate average of these two terms and equating it
to the other natural frequencies in the table yields:

Equating the ﬁrst two terms gives the relation R = l/√2.
The second two terms yield t = R√3, and the remaining
equality yields no new information. In terms of the wire
length l, the disk radius and thickness are related by

R = l/√2, t = l

3/2.

(19)

p

Ideally, Eq. 19 guarantees equal single–stage frequencies
and therefore equal attenuation of vibrations for each
DOF of the multi–stage TVI with identical stages.
In
practice this condition is relaxed somewhat, as explained
in Sec. V and reﬂected in Figs. 4 and 5.

B. Optimal Number of Stages

The maximum attenuation per DOF can now in prin-
ciple be obtained by maximizing the number of stages n,
subject to the above constraints. At this point, however,
the design is of course limited by the geometrical con-
straints of the containment system and the properties of
appropriate TVI construction materials.

With the equality of the natural frequencies of each
DOF guaranteed by the constraints in the previous sec-
tion, the attenuation may optimized based on motion in
only one particular DOF. For the choice of longitudinal
motion along the 3-axis, the single-stage transfer function
is given by:

and substituting Eq. 19 gives:

T0x3 =

.

The geometrical constraint of the containment system
is modeled by limiting the total possible height of the
stack to some ﬁnite value. This translates into a total
ﬁnite length L for all wires along one side of the stack.
With n total stages of equal length, the wire length l per
stage is l = L/n.

The cross-sectional area A of the spring wires is limited
by the elastic limit stress s, or the stress at which acoustic
emission becomes intolerable.
If F is the force on one
of the six wires supporting a single–stage isolator, the
minimum cross-section is given by

6

A0 =

s

.

(23)

As this point, the requirement that each stage in the
multi-stage TVI model have equivalent geometry is re-
laxed in order to permit the minimum wire cross–section
per stage. This results in a range of natural frequencies
ωµ in the stack. However, as long as Eq. 19 is made to
hold for each stage, and as long as ωµ
ω for all µ, the
multi–stage TVI will still operate eﬀectively in all DOF.
For the µth stage in a stack of n stages (with µ = 1
corresponding to the top stage), the minimum wire cross
section for that stage requires a factor of (n
µ + 1) due
to the weight of the stages below it. Substituting Eq. 19,

(24)

Ensuring the maximum tolerable force on each wire also
has the eﬀect of maximizing the frequencies of the trans-
verse modes on the spring wires, an important point to
be considered below.

Inserting the last expression into Eq. 22, and again
using Eq. 19, the transfer function for the µth stage of

This expression illustrates importance of using spring

Fig. 7 shows a plot of Tx3, using the parameters in Ta-
ble II. The constraints speciﬁed in this model limit the
exponential rise in attenuation with the number of stages

stages (1 dB

only to the asymptotic regime, the upper limit of which,

C. Eﬀect of Spring Transverse Modes

In the design of a TVI, care must be taken to ensure
that the frequencies of the transverse modes of the spring
wires lie well above the operation frequency. Otherwise,
the wires will not act as lumped–element springs.

The fundamental transverse frequency of a wire of

length l is given by:

ωt =

π
l s

T
η

,

(28)

where T is the tension in the wire and η is the wire mass
per unit length. From the previous section, the tension
in the wire is automatically maximized;
it is just the
elastic limit times the cross-section: T = sA. The mass
per unit length is η = ρwA, where ρw is the wire mass
density. Applying Eq. 19, the lowest transverse frequency
becomes:

ωt =

nπ
L

s
ρw

.

r
This function is plotted in Fig. 8, using the parameters in
Table II. For this model, any choice of n greater than 3
insures that all transverse spring frequencies are at least
twice the operational frequency.

An important assumption made in the optimization
procedure is that the diameter of the spring wires is
allowed to decrease on successively lower stages in the
stack. From Eq. 24 for the cross-sectional area of the
spring wires on a given stage, and using Eq. 19, the di-
ameter of the spring wires on the µth stage of an n-stage
TVI is given by:

dw =

The diameter is plotted as a function of stage number in
Fig. 9, for the cases µ = 1 (top stage) and µ = n (bottom
stage), using the parameters in Tables II and III. The
values of the curves at a given n deﬁne the range of wire
diameters needed for the construction of a TVI with the
attenuation shown in Fig. 7.

For n > 10, the diameters required fall well below 25
µm, which may be a practical limit. Note the depen-
dence of Eq. 30 on ρd, illustrating the importance of
choosing stage masses of high density. Wires of larger
diameter may be used at some cost of attenuation, but
care should be taken to avoid transverse modes in the
operating range.

A. Choice of Materials

The preceding discussion mandates a choice of a
high–density material for the construction of the TVI
masses. For our speciﬁc application, the masses must
non-magnetic, and be vacuum and cryogenically com-
patible. An ideal choice would be tungsten, but brass
is selected for its low cost and ease of machining.

The spring wires should have a combination of low elas-
tic modulus and density, and, most importantly, high
elastic limit. Beryllium copper and certain aluminum
alloys have ideal characteristics, and have the added ad-
vantage of being non-magnetic. However, type 304 stain-

7

less steel is chosen for its availability at low cost in many
diﬀerent diameters.10

The construction of a TVI for a small laboratory ap-
plication is considerably simpliﬁed if the spring wires can
be made to attach to a set of coplanar screws bolted to
the outer rim of each suspended disk, as suggested by
Fig. 1. This makes impractical the requirement t > l,
as derived in Sec. IV A.
If the screws are set into the
midplane of each disk, the hexagonal geometry of the at-
tachment points guarantees the stage spacing to be R, as
long as R = l/√2.

FIG. 9. Wire diameter vs. number of stages for top stage
(solid curve) and bottom stage (dashed curve) in analytical
model of a TVI with operation frequency of 1 kHz and prop-
erties in Tables II and III.

A simple choice would be to set both the stage thick-
ness and the inter-stage gap to R/2. However, smaller
disk thicknesses drive the frequencies of the 1- and 2-
rotational modes higher relative to the other modes, so
that t
l/2 is a better choice. The rotational
modes increase, but not enough to reach into the do-
main of the 1 kHz operating frequency (as seen in Fig. 5).
In fact, this choice changes the optimization expressions
used in Secs. IV B and IV C only by small numerical fac-
tors.

The size of our vacuum chamber limits the total height
of the stack to 11.5 cm. With a stage separation distance
R, the total wire length is then simply L = R√2, or 16.2
cm.

The total wire length needed and the properties of the
mass and spring wire materials are listed in Tables II
and III. (These properties, and the operation frequency
ω =1 kHz, were used to generate the optimization curves
in section IV). To reduce the likelihood of acoustic emis-
sion, a value for the elastic limit of stainless steel equal
to 1/3 the tabulated value is assumed.

The required degree of vibration isolation can be

roughly estimated as the ratio of the force exerted by our
gram–mass oscillator resonating at 1 kHz to the gravita-
tional force between it and a similar oscillator spaced 1
mm away. This is roughly 1012, or 240 dB.

Reading oﬀ Fig. 7, 240 dB requires a stack of at least
ﬁve stages. A six–stage design is chosen to conserve on
labor and maintenance, which with ﬁne wires can be del-
icate and time–consuming. Fig. 8 indicates that any
transverse spring modes in a six–stage stack will have
frequencies greater 5 kHz, safely above the operating
range. Finally, Fig. 9 shows that a six–stage stack re-
quires spring wire diameters ranging from about 30 to 80
µm.

The expected loss in attenuation due to the sub–
optimal disk thickness can be compensated by choosing
smaller wire gauges than speciﬁed in Fig. 9. The design
is optimized assuming an elastic limit below the actual
maximum, so the ﬁnal design uses wire diameters ranging
from 25 to 45 µm.

B. Assembly

The choice of six stages ﬁxes the length of each wire
per stage to l = L/n = 16.2/6 = 2.7 cm. The disks
have dimensions R = l/√2 = 1.9 cm, t = l/2 = 1.3 cm,
and are easily machined from brass stock. Seven disks
are machined, with the ﬁrst intended to attach to the
support structure.

Holes are drilled and tapped into the center plane of
each disk at 60 degree intervals to provide for the six
6-32 screws which serve as wire attachment posts. Addi-
tional holes are drilled into the top and bottom surfaces
of the ﬁrst and seventh disk, for mounting to the support

structure and for attaching the isolated instruments.

Since the attachment of the wires is a delicate proce-
dure, the seven disks must ﬁrst be mounted securely. For
this purpose, additional holes are drilled into the center
plane of each disk, at 120 degree intervals. Three thin
brass strips, each with seven holes spaced 1.9 cm apart,
can then be attached to the stack using the extra holes,
ﬁrmly ﬁxing the disks in a vertical stack (Fig. 10).

With the strips in place, the wire attachment posts are
assembled using the remaining holes in each disk. Each
post consists of a vented aluminum spacer, a thin brass
washer, and a thin nylon washer, secured to the disk with
a vented screw (Fig. 11 and Table IV).

The posts are designed so that a single strand of spring
wire can be used to support each stage, rather than six
separate strands of wire. For example, in Fig. 10, one
end of a 16.2 cm piece of wire is attached between the
brass and aluminum washers at point A, and the other
end is attached to a small weight. The wire is then woven
between the washers at points B through F successively,
and re-attached at point A. During this operation, as
soon as the wire is woven around a particular post, the
weighted end is left to hang while the post screw is tight-
ened, thereby insuring uniform wire tension between each
post. The nylon washer on each post is lubricated with
vacuum pump oil, so that it does not rotate the brass
washer (and thereby apply torque to the wire) as the
screw is tightened.

As per the optimization procedure, wires of smaller
gauges are used to connect successively lower stages, as
speciﬁed in Table II. After all post screws are tightened
on each stage, the brass strips are removed and the ﬁn-
ished isolator is ready for use (Fig. 12).

C. Single–Stage Test

The experimental veriﬁcation of a multi–stage TVI is
a challenging problem due to the diﬃculty of observing
the multiple, closely–spaced normal modes and the highly
attenuated motion of the lower stages. We limit ourselves
here to checking the natural frequencies of a single stage.
The single–stage isolator is constructed using the ma-
terials and speciﬁcations in Tables II–IV (the diameter
of the single wire is 30 µm). Using the same set of de-
sign parameters, plus some small reﬁnements to include
the wire posts, a ﬁnite element analysis is performed with
ANSYS. The normal mode frequencies are also calculated
analytically using formulae similar to those in Table I,

with slight translations, so that the labels in Table V are
to some extent misnomers for the case of the numerical
analysis (and for the measurements).

The resonant frequencies of the single–stage TVI are
measured with a PZT transducer. The transducer is
bolted to the stage using one of the spare holes for the
brass assembly strips, and the output is fed to a spectrum
analyzer. Six frequencies are observed. In order to iden-
tify an observed frequency with a particular mode, the
spectrum analyzer response is monitored as the sensitive
axis of the PZT is oriented in each direction associated
with the predominant motion of the predicted modes.
The largest signal on the analyzer for a particular orien-
tation is then recorded as the frequency of the associated
mode.

Using this procedure, the six frequencies can be identi-
ﬁed with expected modes. The measurements are plotted
in Fig. 13, against the predictions from the ﬁnite element
analysis. The results agree to within 10% for each fre-
quency.

but with corrections for the eﬀect of attaching the spring
wires at points outside the disk radii, and for the ad-
ditional rotational inertia due to the wire posts. These
results are summarized in Table V.

As in the multi–stage case in Sec. III, the methods are
in better agreement (within 9%) for translations along
and rotations about the 3-axis. The 10–30% discrepan-
cies between the other modes arise because the pure 1-
and 2- translations and rotations assumed by the ana-
lytical model are only approximations of the actual mo-
tion for these modes. The ANSYS graphics indicate that
these modes involve pendulum–type motions. The modes
labeled “translations” in the transverse directions in Ta-
ble V actually mix the translations with slight rotations
about the transverse axes. Similarly, “rotations” mix

VI. CONCLUSIONS

An approximate analytical model for a multi–stage
TVI can be constructed from a one–dimensional spring–

10

mass chain, in which the spring constants are derived
from the geometry of a single stage. The full solution to
this model makes exact predictions for the normal modes
involving translations along and rotations about the lon-
gitudinal axis of the isolator, as computed with a ﬁnite
element analysis. The model gives good approximations
for the transverse modes as well.

The high–frequency behavior of an isolator with iden-
tical (or nearly identical) stages is well characterized by
the natural frequencies of a single stage in all DOF, which
are easily calculated with the model. These frequencies
depend on the design parameters of the TVI in a straight-
forward way and are very useful for the design of a multi–
stage isolator.

We have used the single–stage frequency formulae to
design a ﬁxed–length TVI for operation at 1 kHz in all
DOF. The model illustrates the importance of selecting
stage masses of high density, and spring materials of low
elastic modulus and high elastic limit. The last quality is
important for both the maximization of the attenuation
and for ensuring that the transverse modes of the spring
wires are well above the operating frequency.

The model makes accurate predicitons for the single–
frequencies in the ﬁnal design, which are in the range
of 100 Hz. With six stages, the attenuation of our
centimeter–scale TVI is estimated at 260 dB.

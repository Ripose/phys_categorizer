The Modern FPGA as Discriminator, TDC and ADC

Recent generations of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become indispensible tools
for complex state machine control and signal processing, and now routinely incorporate CPU cores
to allow execution of user software code. At the same time, their exceptional performance permits
low-power implementation of functionality previously the exclusive domain of dedicated analog
electronics. Speciﬁc examples presented here use FPGAs as discriminator, time-to-digital (TDC)
and analog-to-digital converter (ADC). All three cases are examples of instrumentation for current
or future astroparticle experiments.

I. MOTIVATION

II. ANITA DISCRIMINATOR

The Antarctic

Impulsive Transient Antenna
(ANITA) [2][3] experiment is a balloon-borne pay-
load targeted to make the ﬁrst observation of the ﬂux
of ultra-high energy neutrinos, which must exist due
to the presence of the high-energy ﬂux of cosmic ray
protons. ANITA uses the generation of impulsive
radio signals in the Antarctic ice, produced by neu-
trino interactions at very high energy, as the detec-
tion method. A photograph of the ANITA payload
preparing for its engineering ﬂight in New Mexico is
seen in Fig. 1.

Recent generations of Field Programmable Gate
Arrays (FPGAs) have become incredibly powerful
system-on-chip devices. With companion sensors
and a data interface, they become valuable data col-
lection nodes for the physical sciences. For certain
applications, it has become apparent that these logic
devices themselves can serve as the crucial process-
ing elements of instrumentation electronics. Speciﬁc
applications where this resource can be tapped in-
clude, but are not limited to:

compact form factor (complete system with
very small footprint)

ultra low-power

input-output (I/O) limited systems

low Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

Speciﬁc examples presented here use the Xilinx
Spartan-3 FPGA, a low-cost and ﬂexible device gen-
erously made available through the Xilinx University
Program [1]. High performance instrumentation is
increasingly a marriage between custom Application
Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs) and high per-
formance FPGAs, capable of processing and trans-
mitting the data collected. In certain applications,
the external circuitry simpliﬁes dramatically, and
much of the critical functionality can be provided
by the FPGA itself.

Three examples are presented here as solutions
to power, size and noise constraints of current and
planned neutrino detection experiments. While spe-
ciﬁc to these ﬁelds, the techniques are generally ap-
plicable to measurement requirements in other dis-
ciplines.

preparing to launch. Antarctic ﬂight is scheduled for De-
cember 2006.

As a long-duration balloon-borne payload over the
Antarctic continent, power is a severe constraint
on the instrumentation. Particularly for trigger-
ing and sampling many dozens of antennas over the
full bandwidth of 0.2-1.2 GHz, with greater than
Nyquist sampling. The strategy adopted for ANITA
is to split the signal as shown in Fig. 2 and use the
trigger information to decide when the analog sam-
ples [4, 5] should be held and digitized. This scheme
can reduce the power required by two orders of mag-
nitude or more.

FIG. 2: In order to minimize the power required, signals
from the antennas are split into analog sampling and trig-
ger paths. To provide trigger robustness, the full 1GHz
bandwidth is split into 4 separate frequency bands, which
serve as separate trigger inputs.

A. Triggering

In order to distinguish background thermal noise
from transient radio-frequency signatures of neu-
trino interactions, the primary trigger consists of 256
channels of high-speed discriminator. A discrimi-
nator is a combination of a fast comparator and a
1-shot circuit to give a signal passing threshold a
ﬁxed width output for the purposes of forming a
well-deﬁned signal coincidence.

In order to meet the physics requirements, thresh-
olds for the trigger must be pushed as far down into
the thermal noise as can be sustained. Studies in-
dicate [6] that this corresponds to single ﬁlter-band
trigger rates of 1-2MHz. Operation at such a high
rate near threshold requires a comparator of exceed-
ingly high gain-bandwidth (GBW) product. In ad-
dition, such comparators are likely to produce signif-
icant amounts of EMI due to fast switching output
signals.

Within the FPGA considered, it turns out that
with proper threshold setting, the Low-Voltage Dif-
ferential Signalling (LVDS) [7] comparator inputs
Internal
provide exceptional GBW performance.
logic can be used to form an adjustable width out-
put 1-shot circuit, immune from “runt” (very nar-
row temporal pulse) generation, which is a common
problem in this type of discriminator logic. This cir-
cuitry is illustrated in Fig. 3.

Using a 250MHz CLK signal, generated from the
Digital Clock Manager (DCM) as derived from a
33MHz (PCI clock) reference, the discriminator out-
put can be quantized in 4ns steps.

Avoiding full signal swings external to the FPGA
helps in two signiﬁcant ways: it reduces the power
required by providing the input directly to the
FPGA, and just as importantly, it reduces the EMI
and board-level noise induced by large, fast external
switching signals.

B.

Implementation

The printed circuit board on which this discrim-
inator is placed is denoted the Sampling Unit for
Radio Frequency (SURF) board and a photo of the
production board stack may be seen in Fig. 4. The
SURF form factor is 6U Eurocard and is designed
to work in a conduction-cooled compact-PCI crate.

B Implementation

3

Four ﬁlter-banded trigger signals for both po-
larizations of four quad-ridge horn antennas are
brought into the high density input connector indi-
cated. These 32 diﬀerential analog signals are con-
verted to 50 Ω single-ended signals, where the other
side of the transformer is held at a reference poten-
tial which optimizes the signal range to that of the
LVDS receiver inputs. Buried microstrip lines are
terminated in 50 Ω termination resistors very close
to the FPGA. The trigger thresholds are set by ap-
plying a voltage to the complementary input of the
LVDS receiver, as seen in Fig. 3. As this input is
high-impedance, threshold setting may be done with
an array of compact, low-power, multi-channel out-
put DACs. Performance of this circuit is presented
in detail in the next subsection.

An early prototype version of this board made use
of eight 4-channel high-speed comparators, which re-
quired additional space, power, and produced sig-
niﬁcant noise. With proper shielding, careful lay-
out, and working with small amplitude swings, the
board level noise was reduced drastically and ap-
pears largely dominated by ambient crate noise.

C. Performance

Performance of this discriminator was evaluated
in a number of ways. As a ﬁrst step, a simple scan
of count rate versus threshold for ampliﬁed ther-
mal noise, approximating the expected amplitude in
ﬂight, was performed as shown in Fig. 5

The curve follows expectations, considering three
key features of the 12-ns output width 1-shot logic
(adjustable in 4ns clock steps) and its “stuck on”
detect circuit. These features are enumerated in the
ﬁgure and explained in detail below.

1. Saturation at 16MHz is the result of a “stuck
on” detect circuit, which is used to resolve the
potential ambiguity in absolute trigger rate.
That is, a measured rate could be do to the
signal just poking above threshold at a rate
of 1MHz or only dropping below threshold at
a rate of 1MHz. This circuit detects the lat-
ter condition and enforces a minimum rate of
16MHz when the threshold is too low.

2. The curve deviates from linear on this plot as
the 12ns 1-shot deadtime starts to become im-
portant. At 8.3MHz (120ns average period),
this becomes a 10% eﬀect and eventually leads
to the curve rolling over, as can be seen.

3. Threshold voltage shown is on a relative scale
with respect to a voltage oﬀset; only the rela-
tive voltage is important.

Next a signal is embedded in the noise and the
trigger eﬃciency is studied as a function of thresh-
old. This scan is seen in Fig. 6 for a signal of about
the minimum assumed in Monte Carlo simulation of
the ANITA sensitivity. A coincidence is determined
if a discriminator signal is coincident within 20ns of
a reference strobe from the pulse generator used.

Finally trigger eﬃciency is studied as a function
of the threshold, for the embedded signal with a
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of about 4.1σ before
ﬁlter banding. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the eﬃ-
ciency is tuned as a function of the tolerable singles
rate in each channel.

The limit on this rate is dictated by the overall ac-
cidental trigger rate downstream, which we expect
to be in the range indicated. Since the antenna trig-
ger eﬃciency requires only a 3-of-8 coincidence, the
overall eﬃciency improves as can be seen in Fig. 8.

As seen in the ﬁgure,

if an eﬃciency of about
80% can be maintained in each band, the overall
Antenna-level trigger (“Level 1” (L1)) eﬃciency is
essentially unity. Even a degradation to 60% sin-
gle band eﬃciency means an L1 eﬃciency of roughly
95%.

In order to check the performance of the 1-shot
circuit and coincidence logic, a scan of L1 Rate was
performed as a function of single band rates for only
thermal noise input (no signal). The resultant plot
is seen in Fig. 9.

Overlaid is the expected curve for the cumulative
binomial probability of purely random trigger band
signals. The two curves are in good agreement for

an eﬀective coincidence window of 19ns, indicating
a 5ns coincidence overlap requirement.

III. HANOHANO TDC AND QDC

Detecting the much lower energy neutrinos due to
nuclear ﬁsson or fusion requires a detector of ultra-
pure material. The KamLAND detector [8] has been
very successful in measuring solar neutrinos, as well
as those from nearby power plants in Japan. How-
ever, the naturally occuring radioactivity in the sur-
rounding mountains limit the sensitivity to possi-
ble neutrinos from decays deep inside the earth. To
search for these and possible hidden nuclear reactors,
operation of such a detector deep in the ocean is at-
tactive. A prototype of such a detector, designated
HanoHano [9], may be seen in Fig. 10.

Pressure
Housing

PMT

FIG. 10: Concept drawing of HanoHano (right) and a
pixel of its instrumentation: the Photo-Multiplier Tube
(PMT) and its pressure housing (left).

The detector consists of a large volume of ultra-
pure liquid scintillator observed by a large array
of Photo-Multiplier Tubes (PMTs). Deployment of
such an extensive array far at sea is best done with-
out the requirements of a shore cable. Therefore
powering from a battery system is very attactive if
it can be made feasible. Having a single FPGA serve
as Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC), charge(Q)-to-
Digital Converter (QDC) and data collection node,
for a large number of PMTs, represents a great
power savings.

Signal ﬂow for the encoding of the PMT time this
readout can be seen in Fig. 11. Again the LVDS
receiver of the FPGA is used as the comparator in-
put. The output of this comparator is used to latch
a time of the leading edge to measure time and the
trailing edge to measure the total charge Q, which
is proportional to the time-over-threshold.

B. Test Results

The results from a simple Gray-code counter im-
plementation of the hit time recording may be seen
in Fig. 13. The sigma of the distribution is about
1ns, but there are non-Gaussian tails. In this case
the RMS resolution of about 1.3ns is more represen-
tative.

FIG. 11: Low-power PMT Readout board

Using both edges of a 250MHz clock, the expected

ideal time resolution should be

σT =

Tclock
√12

(1)

where Tclock is the 2ns period when using both
clock edges. In this case, a resolution of about 0.6
ns is theoretically possible and is explored below.

A. Readout Implementation

A prototype board for doing this readout can be

seen in Fig. 12

A bundle of 16 PMT signals are brought onto the
board via ribbon cable at left and into the FPGA.
Continuous logging of the T and Q values for each
PMT hit is performed inside the FPGA and dumped
into an on-chip FIFO. Data from this FIFO is col-
lected over a ﬁber optic link (at the right) to the
central data acquisition computer.

FIG. 13: Low-power PMT Readout board

While this is a factor of two worse than theoretical,
it should be pointed out that since the HanoHano
PMTs are largely recording single photons, and the
large PMTs being employed have a Transit-Time-
Spread (TTS) of 3ns, the expected resolution will
only degrade to

p(3ns)2 + (1.3ns)2

or by about 10%. Nevertheless, since high clock
speeds and more clever algorithms are possible, bet-
ter timing will continue to be pursed.

IV. SALSA ADC

Should the ANITA experiment conﬁrm the ex-
pected ﬂux of GZK neutrinos, a next generation of
terrestrial neutrino telescope will exploit this source
for both astronomy and particle physics. An ex-
ample of such a detector is the proposed Salt-dome
Shower Array (SalSA) [? ]. A schematic view of
such a detector may be seen in Fig. 14, where an
of drill holes into the salt (or ice) are instrumented
with a lattice of antennas.

As indicated in the ﬁgure, salt has the advantage
of being 2.4 times as dense as ice and of equally
high radio transmission. An earlier study of low-cost
readout was performed using short waveform sam-
ple buﬀers [11]. Further studies have indicated that
to perform particle identiﬁcation, improvements to
the current generation of low-power, compact Radio-
Frequency sampling ASICs [4, 5] will involve a read-
out capable of much longer waveform samples.

This may be seen in Fig. 15. Particle identiﬁca-
tion is possible by the ﬂavor-speciﬁc pattern of sub-
threshold emissions (secondary showers) along the
lepton track. However, to do so requires the ability
to record record lengths of order of the transit time
across the array in order to capture subthreshold
signals.

A proposal [12] was written to MOSIS [13] to fund
the fabrication of a test ASIC in a 0.25µm CMOS
process. This device has 64k deep sampling, which
provides for up to 32µs of storage at 2GSa/s. In or-
der to accomodate so many devices on a relatively

FIG. 16: Conversion of held samples using an external
ramp and the FPGA.

This scheme is quite general and with the use of an
array of external sample/hold circuits, or for rather
slow speed signals, direct conversion of analog sig-
nals with the FPGA may be performed. Experience
has shown that the performance of this type of en-
coding is limited by the quality of the clock source
and the linearity of the ramp. Fortunately the on-
chip PLL provides for quite stable clock sources and
because the LVDS inputs are high impedance, a very
simple and yet high-quality ramp generator can be
made with a current source, a capacitor and a reset
transistor.

Performance simulations have been done in
SPICE and may be seen in Fig. 17. The ASIC is
currently in fabrication.

One advantage of performing the time encoding in
programmable logic is that the resolution can be tai-
lored to the application. A trade-oﬀ can be made be-
tween speed and resolution in a highly ﬂexible way.

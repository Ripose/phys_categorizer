Flicker noise in high-speed p-i-n photodiodes

March 2, 2005

Abstract

The microwave signal at the output of a photodiode that detects a
modulated optical beam contains the phase noise ϕ(t) and the ampli-
tude noise α(t) of the detector. Beside the white noise, which is well
understood, the spectral densities Sϕ(f ) and Sα(f ) show ﬂicker noise,
proportional to 1/f . We report on the measurement of the phase and am-
plitude noise of high-speed p-i-n photodiodes. The main result is that the
ﬂicker coeﬃcient of the samples is ∼ 10−12
/Hz)
for phase noise, and ∼ 10−12 Hz−1 (−120 dB) for amplitude noise. These
values could be observed only after solving a number of experimental prob-
lems and in a protected environment. By contrast, in ordinary conditions
insuﬃcient EMI isolation, and also insuﬃcient mechanical isolation, are
responsible for additional noise to be taken in. This suggests that if pack-
age and EMC are revisited, applications can take the full beneﬁt from the
surprisingly low noise of the p-i-n photodiodes.

1 Introduction

Many high performance applications of microwave photonics and optics are im-
pacted by phase noise of the microwave signals modulated as sidebands on the
optical carrier. Examples of such applications include the frequency distribution
system in the NASA Deep Space Network [CWK+00], very long baseline radio
astronomy interferometry arrays (VLBI) [SHK+00], laboratory time and fre-
quency comparisons [NLL+03, BDKM99], photonic oscillators [YM96, YM97],
and laser metrology [SLK01, IDH03]. The contributions of nearly all microwave
and photonic circuit elements to the phase noise is, for most part, well un-
derstood, or at least determined experimentally. This is not the case for the
contributions of the photodetector to the phase noise. Many high performance
systems such as those mentioned above could be limited by the close-in noise
of the photodetector. Yet the lack of information regarding this topic—only

one conference article [SYML98] is found in the literature—made this work nec-
essary.
In this paper we describe a sensitive measurement technique for the
close-in phase noise and amplitude noise, and the measurement of several pho-
todetectors used to detect microwave (10 GHz) sidebands of optical carriers.

When a light beam is modulated in intensity by a microwave signal and fed
into a photodetector, the detector delivers a copy of the microwave signal at
its output, with added noise. Flicker noise is the random ﬂuctuations of the
microwave phase and of the fractional amplitude, ϕ(t) and α(t), with power
spectrum density S(f ) proportional to 1/f . This refers to the representation

s(t) = V0[1 + α(t)] cos[2πνµt + ϕ(t)] .

(1)

The phase noise spectrum Sϕ(f ) is of paramount importance because ϕ is related
to time, which is the most precisely measured physical quantity. For a review
on phase noise see the References [Rut78, CCI90, Vig99].

Most high-speed photodetectors are InGaAs p-i-n diodes operated in strong
reverse-bias condition, hence as photoconductors. Reverse biasing is necessary
for high speed because the high electric ﬁeld reduces the transit time of the
carriers, and also limits the junction capacitance. Thus, the depletion region
(the intrinsic layer) can be tailored for quantum eﬃciency and speed. The p-i-n
diode has the interesting property that even at relatively low reverse bias Vb
(∼ 5 V) the junction capacitance is chieﬂy determined by the thickness of the
i layer [Sze81, pp. 118–119], with little inﬂuence from Vb. This indicates that
phase noise may be lower than in other microwave devices.

2 Experimental method

A preliminary survey of the available detectors shows that none provides output
power suﬃcient to use a saturated mixer as the phase detector, and that typical
photodetectors have lower noise than common microwave ampliﬁers. Hence we
opt for the bridge (interferometric) method, which permits ﬂicker-free ampliﬁca-
tion before detection. This method, inspired to [San68], is now a well established
technique. The full theory and an extensive description of the experimental as-
pects is available in [RG02]. Hence, the description given here focus on the
adaptation of the bridge method to the measurement of the photodiodes.

In our conﬁguration (Fig. 1) the two detector outputs are combined with
appropriate phase and amplitude, so that the sum (Σ) and the diﬀerence (∆)
are available at the output of the hybrid junction. At the equilibrium condition
all of the microwave power goes in Σ, while only the imbalance signal, i.e., the
photodetector noise plus some residual carrier, is present in ∆. Close-in ﬂicker
noise in ampliﬁers is a parametric eﬀect that results from the ﬂicker ﬂuctuation
of the dc bias that modulates the microwave carrier. Of course, the microwave
output spectrum is white at zero or very low power. Hence the noise sidebands
present in ∆ are ampliﬁed without adding ﬂicker. The Σ ampliﬁer provides the
power needed to saturate the LO port of the mixer, for it ﬂickers. Yet it is

where g is the ampliﬁer gain, Pµ the microwave power, R0 = 50 Ω the character-
istic resistance, and ℓ the mixer ssb loss. Under the conditions of our setup (see
below) the gain is 43 dBV[/rad], including the dc preampliﬁer. The notation
[/rad] means that /rad appears when appropriate.

Calibration involves the assessment of kd and the adjustment of γ. The gain
is measured through the carrier power at the diode output, obtained as the power
at the mixer RF port when only one detector is present (no carrier suppression
takes place) divided by the detector-to-mixer gain. This measurement relies on
a power meter and on a network analyzer. The detection angle γ is ﬁrst set by
inserting a reference phase modulator in series with one detector, and nulling
the output by inspection with a lock-in ampliﬁer. Under this condition the
system detect α. After adding a reference 90◦ to γ, based either on a network
analyzer or on the calibration of the phase shifter, the system detects ϕ. The
phase modulator is subsequently removed to achieve a higher sensitivity in the
ﬁnal measurements. Removing the modulator is possible and free from errors
because the phase relationship at the mixer inputs is rigidly determined by the
carrier suppression in ∆, which exhibits the accuracy of a null measurement.

modulator (EOM) is rejected. The amplitude noise of the source is rejected
to the same degree of the carrier attenuation in ∆, as results from the general
properties of the balanced bridge. This rejection applies to amplitude noise and
to the laser relative intensity noise (RIN).

The power of the microwave source is set for the maximum modulation index
m, which is the Bessel function J1(·) that results from the sinusoidal response of
the EOM. This choice also provides increased rejection of the amplitude noise of
the microwave source. The sinusoidal response of the EOM results in harmonic
distortion, mainly of odd order; however, these harmonics are out of the system
bandwidth. The photodetectors are operated with some 0.5 mW input power,
which is low enough for the detectors to operate in a linear regime. This makes
possible a high carrier suppression (50–60 dB) in ∆, which is stable for the
duration of the measurement (half an hour), and also provides a high rejection
of the laser RIN and of the noise of the ∆ ampliﬁer. The coherence length of
the YAG laser used in our experiment is about 1 km, and all optical signals in
the system are highly coherent.

3 Results

The background noise of the instrument is measured in two steps. A ﬁrst value
is measured by replacing the photodetectors output with two microwave signals
of the same power, derived from the main source. The noise of the source is
rejected by the bridge measurement. A more subtle mechanism, which is not
detected by the ﬁrst measurement, is due to the ﬂuctuation of the mixer oﬀset
voltage induced by the ﬂuctuation of the LO power [BMU77]. This eﬀect is

measured in a second test, by restoring the photodetectors and breaking the
path from the hybrid junction to the ∆ ampliﬁer, and terminating the two
free ends. The worst case is used as the background noise. The background
thereby obtained places an upper bound for the 1/f noise, yet hides the shot
noise. This is correct because the shot noise arises in the photodiodes, not in
the instrument. The design criteria of Sec. 2 result in a background ﬂicker of
approximately −135 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz, hardly visible above 10 Hz (Fig.
2). The white noise, about −140 dB[rad2]/Hz, is close to the expected value,
within a fraction of a decibel. It is used only as a diagnostic check, to validate
the calibration.

We tested three photodetectors, a Fermionics HSD30, a Discovery Semicon-
ductors DSC30-1k, and a Lasertron QDMH3. These devices are InGaAs p-i-n
photodiodes suitable to the wavelength of 1.3 µm and 1.55 µm, exhibiting and a
bandwidth in excess of 12 GHz, and similar to one another. They are routinely
used in our photonic oscillators [YM96, YM97] and in related experiments.

Each measurement was repeated numerous times with diﬀerent averaging
samples in order to detect any degradation from low-frequency or non-stationary
phenomena, if present. Figure 2 shows an example of the measured spectra.
Combining the experimental data, we calculate the ﬂicker of each device, shown
in Table 1. Each spectrum is aﬀected by a random uncertainty is of 0.5 dB,
due to the parametric spectral estimation (Ref. [PW98], chap. 9), and to the
measurement of the photodetector output power. In addition, we account for a
systematic uncertainty of 1 dB due to the calibration of the gain. The random
uncertainty is ampliﬁed in the process of calculating the noise of the individual
detector from the available spectra. Conversely, the systematic uncertainty is a
constant error that applies to all measurements, for it is not ampliﬁed.

4 Discussion

For practical reasons, we selected the conﬁgurations that give reproducible spec-
tra with low and smooth 1/f noise that are not inﬂuenced by the sample av-
eraging size. Reproducibility is related to smoothness because technical noise
shows up at very low frequencies, while we expect from semiconductors smooth
1/f noise in a wide frequency range. Smoothness was veriﬁed by comparison
with a database of trusted spectra. Technical noise turned out to be a serious
diﬃculty. As no data was found in the literature, we give some practical hints
in Fig. 3.

The EOM requires a high microwave power (20 dBm or more), which is some
50 dB higher than the photodetector output. The isolation in the microwave
circuits is hardly higher than about 120 dB. Thus crosstalk, inﬂuenced by the

7

ﬂuctuating dielectric constant of the environment, turns into a detectable signal.
The system clearly senses the experimentalist waving a hand (≈ 0.2 m/s) at a
distance of 3 m. The spectrum (Fig. 3.1, plot W) is easily taken for ﬂicker. This
problem can be mitigated using the new high-eﬃciency EOMs [vE02].

Air ﬂow aﬀects the delay of the optical ﬁbers, thus some isolation is necessary
to mitigate this eﬀect. All our attempts failed until we inserted optical isolators
in series with the photodetectors, and spliced all the ﬁber junctions (except
the laser output). After this, the back-reﬂected light at the unused port of the
coupler was below the sensitivity of the power-meter, which is 1 nW. Without
isolation and splicing, individual spectra show spikes appearing at random times
(Fig. 3.2, plot S). Averaging yields a smooth spectrum. Yet slope is incorrect
(Fig. 3.3, plot A). Beside the mechanics of the connectors, we attribute this
eﬀect to reﬂection noise in the optical ﬁbers [lGC89, SM98].

Even after isolating and splicing, we observed that bending a ﬁber may re-
sult in increased ﬂickering. Afterwards, the spectrum may become irregular,
or still be smooth with a clean 1/f slope, as in Fig. 3.4, plot F, but neverthe-
less incorrect. We interpret this as a change in the interference pattern in the
ﬁber due to polarization. The observed increase in noise is clearly systematic,
although reproducing the numerical value takes some eﬀort.

Spectral lines at 60 Hz and its multiples are present in the noise spectra,
originated by magnetic ﬁelds, in all cases lower than −110 dB[rad2]/Hz. The
level of these stray signals is about the same found routinely in the phase noise
measurement with the saturated mixer method, yet with a carrier power of some
10 dBm instead of the −26 dBm of our experiments, thus with a signal-to-noise
ratio proportionally higher. The superior immunity of the bridge scheme is due
to microwave ampliﬁcation of the noise sidebands before detecting.

The 1/f spectra of the detectors we measured are similar, and a value of
−120 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz can be taken as representative of both amplitude
and phase noise. Using the formulae available in [Rut78, CCI90, Vig99], a
spectrum of the form h−1/f converted into the Allan (two-sample) variance
σ2(τ ) is σ2 = 2 ln(2) h−1 independent of the measurement time τ . The length
of 1 rad in a ﬁber of refraction index n = 1.45, at the modulation frequency
νµ = 9.9 GHz, of is 3.3 mm. Thus a phase noise of −120 dBrad2/Hz at f = 1 Hz
(h−1 = 10−12) is equivalent to a ﬂuctuation σl(τ ) = 3.9 nm of the optical length
l.

5 Final remarks

It is generally accepted [Sik03] that ﬂicker noise is an elusive phenomenon and
that our understanding is based on models, the most accreditated of which are
due to Hooge [Hoo69] and to McWhorter [McW57], rather than on a uniﬁed
theory. On the other hand, the presence of the phase and amplitude ﬂickering
in a microwave carrier is believed to be the dc ﬂicker, up-converted by a nonlin-
earity. This also applies to the photodiode, even though in this case the dc bias
exists only in the presence of light. In fact, removing the modulation results in

8

a white microwave spectrum, ﬂat around any frequency in the passband of the
ststem.

The experimental diﬃculties we encountered are due to various forms of
technical noise, at an exceedingly low level, which nevertheless may exceed the
detector noise, unless great care is taken. On one hand, this means that the
environment in which the diode is inserted must be revisited if one needs the
lowest achievable noise. On the other hand, this means that the photodiode
exhibits low noise and high stability, and that it has an unexploited potential
for new and emerging applications.

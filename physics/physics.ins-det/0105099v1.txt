1 Introduction

In view of the completion of the ﬁrst experimental phase at the Gran Sasso
underground laboratory, new detector requirements are emerging,
in the
framework of possible activities with atmospheric neutrino detectors, long
baseline neutrino beam from CERN[1] (CNGS), or (at present in a more
speculative way) at neutrino factories. In all the cases, although for diﬀer-
ent reasons, muon spectrometers, identifying muon charge, and possibly to
provide some momentum reconstruction[2, 3] are required. The small neu-
trino cross section reﬂects in large area and/or volume experiments:
it is
therefore mandatory to rely upon detector choices which can assure reason-
able accuracies on the basis of a well assessed technology, reducing as much
as possible the number of electronic channels to be implemented. The ex-
perience acquired with the already existing underground detectors suggests
possible solutions. For example, streamer tube chambers[4] with a cell size
of about 3x3 cm2, similar to those developed for the MACRO experiment[5],
could be operated as drift tubes. These devices were originally operated in
digital mode, with wire and pick up strip readout in two coordinates, for the
recognition of charged track pattern, with a point resolution of about 1 cm.
Therefore they have been operated with simple electronics and without strin-
gent stability and uniformity monitoring. Furthermore, these devices have
been exhibiting a remarkable reliability, being capable of continuous opera-
tion for more than ten years.

∼

The space resolution required by a massive muon spectrometer analyzing
muons from neutrino interaction in a Long Base line experiment is limited by
the multiple scattering occurring in the magnetized iron: a space resolution
1mm is considered satisfactory. Similar considerations apply to the
of
case of atmospheric neutrino detectors. For this reason it is worthwhile to
investigate the attainable space resolution of these devices.
It is already
known in literature how the streamer regime can be advantageous for drift
operation, provided that a low rate environment exists[6]: in that paper the
results obtained using a streamer tube cell with cross section (0.9x0.9) cm2

2

150µm. The goal of this paper is to
were reported, showing a resolution σx≃
show that large size cell streamer tubes, constructed in the “coverless” ﬁeld
conﬁguration[4], even if their electric ﬁeld cannot be considered as optimal
and even if the accuracy in their mechanical construction is not better than
0.1 mm, can achieve the required space resolution.

According to the present safety rules, it is not conceivable to reconvert
the already existing tubes of MACRO since they are built in PVC. However,
they can be constructed with a diﬀerent, non dangerous, thermo–plastic ma-
terial, for instance ABS(Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene), always ensuring
fabrication costs which are advantageous with respect to other wire-device
solutions.

To measure the resolution attainable in drift mode with a streamer tube
device with large cells, we made a speciﬁc test on an 8-wire “coverless tube”
chamber of the same kind as used in the MACRO experiment, with the
only diﬀerence of being 50 cm long. The test has been performed selecting
cosmic ray tracks by means of a high precision telescope realized with silicon
pixel arrays. After the description of the test set-up, we shall describe the
calibration of the measurement and the experimental results.

2 Set up description

The experimental setup for the test consisted of a high precision cosmic ray
telescope and the streamer chamber under test (Fig.1). The telescope was
built using two planes of silicon pixel arrays and two plastic scintillators
(20x70x10) mm3 for triggering purposes. The silicon pixel detectors used
were arrays of 8064 pixels with dimensions of (330 x 330) µm2, and a thickness
of about 300µm. These pixels are readout in digital mode, providing thus
only the coordinates of the pixels hit by a particle. These detectors are the
same as the ones used in the DELPHI Very Forward Tracker (VFT, [7, 8]).
The active area of 990 mm2 is divided into 10 regions of 24x24 pixels, followed
by six regions of 24x16 pixels, for a total length of 69mm and a width of

3

22mm and 17mm respectively. Typical ﬁgure of merit of these detectors are
ǫ
99%, with a threshold around 10,000 electrons, a number of noisy pixels
at 0.3% level and a point resolution of 100µm in both coordinates.

≈

A 50 cm long chamber of the same kind of those used in MACRO has been
positioned in the middle plane of the telescope (Fig. 1). The description of
the plastic streamer tubes of MACRO has been extensively reported in [5] and
references therein. We remind here that the basic unit of the tube system is
a chamber containing eight individual cells. The single cell is (2.9 x 2.7) cm2.
The anode wire (silvered Be-Cu) has a diameter of 100 µm. Three sides of the
cell are coated with a low–resistivity graphite (< 1 kΩ/square) to perform the
cathode function by the electrode-less shaping principle [10]. This structure
is inserted inside an uncoated PVC envelope (1.5 mm thick) and closed by
two plastic end caps at the ends. The overall external size of our chamber
is 3.2 cm x 25 cm x 50 cm. Each wire behaves as a transmission line with
a characteristic impedance of 330 Ω and a propagation time sligthly larger
than 3.3 ns/m. They provide both digital readout for tracking and analog
(charge) readout. The chamber is ﬂuxed with an Argon + Isobutane with
relative fractions of 50/50 gas mixture, controlled within a 15% accuracy.
In these operation conditions, full eﬃciency is achieved for an anode high
voltage value of about 5500 V, with a single counting rate plateau spanning
from 5200 V to 5900 V. The operation properties of streamer tubes operating
with various gas mixtures has been extensively studied in [4, 5, 11] and
references therein. The ﬁeld conﬁguration of the coverless MACRO tube cell
can be derived from Fig. 2 which shows the equipotential lines as obtained
with the GARFIELD program[12] for an anode voltage of 5500 V.

The geometry of the setup is sketched in Fig. 1. A cartesian coordinate
system is deﬁned , having the x axis parallel to the long side of the pixel
detectors, the z axis parallel to the short side of the pixel detectors and to
the wires of streamer tube. As a consequence the y axis is perpendicular to
the plane of the detectors. Since the pixel detectors are only 69 mm long, the
trigger area covers 2 cells and the edge region of the adjacent ones. All the

4

∼

measurements reported here have been performed with a distance between
the silicon planes of 79 mm. In this conﬁguration, we triggered only tracks
with an angle with respect to the vertical not exceeding 35◦, with a most
probable value around 10◦. The cosmic trigger rate was of

1 track/min.

The accuracy in the determination of the track position at the wire level,
taking into account the multiple scattering in the silicon pixels and in the
streamer tube walls, is <90 µm, assuming an average muon energy of
1
∼
GeV. The trigger signal is provided by the coincidence of the scintillator
pulses. The telescope is readout by means of a Pixel Readout Repeater,
driven by a Pixel Camac Board[7], that provides the necessary timing sig-
nals and the power supply lines. The signal from the tube wires are OR-ed
together by means of a resistive network, providing an output signal on 50
Ω impedance. The wire pulses are properly discriminated (50mV /50Ω) and
sent to a TDC (Lecroy 2228A), which records the time diﬀerence between
the scintillator trigger signal and the streamer chamber signals. The TDC
was used with a 1bit resolution of 250ps.

The acquisition chain has been realized by means of a Labview appli-
cation, developed in our group, and was controlled by a PC equipped with
a GPIB CAMAC controller (Lecroy 8901 A). The acquisition included also
a scaler (Lecroy 2551) to record the counts of the scintillators and of the
singles tubes, in order to perform stability checks. The Pixel Readout runs
continuously a gate–reset sequence until a scintillator trigger in coincidence
with the gate is received. In this case the ﬁrst bit of an input/output register
is used to control the synchronization between the PC and the Pixel Camac
Board. The acquisition monitoring is provided by a graphical interface.

3 Detector calibration

As a ﬁrst step, we used a small data sample to have a precise geometri-
cal survey of the actual position of the wires. Fig. 3 shows the drift dis-
tance as a function of the X position computed at the wires level Y=0,

5

measured by using the silicon pixel detector. The wires are of course posi-
tioned where the drift distance reaches his minimum, i.e. at the lower cusp
points of the v–shaped distributions. By means of a linear ﬁt to the four
straight portions of this scatter plot we obtained Xwire 1 =(1.95
0.05)cm
and Xwire 2 =(4.85
0.05)cm. A ﬁrst measurement of the average drift ve-
locity Vdrif t (neglecting diﬀerences as a function of the distance from the
wire) can be obtained by selecting vertical tracks and imposing:

±

±

·

Max(T DC)

Vdrif t = Cell/2,

RT DC ·
where Max(TDC) is the maximum value of the TDC in the data sample,
RT DC is the conversion factor from TDC channels to ns and Cell/2 is half of
the cell length. The actual cell width of each tube is known with an accuracy
of 0.1 mm.

(1)

The value of RT DC has been calibrated to be RT DC=0.242ns/channel and
RT DC=0.248ns/channel for the ﬁrst and the second cell respectively. The
resulting average drift velocity from the above mentioned data sample was
found to be Vdrif t=(4.5

0.3) cm/µs.

Data were collected at diﬀerent operation high voltage, ranging from
5500 V to 5900 V, by using simultaneously two tube cells. The gas mix-
ture was kept unchanged.

±

We do not expect a constant drift velocity as a function of position.
Therefore, in order to derive a more accurate estimate of the space-time
relation, we adopted the following method for each diﬀerent set of operation
conditions.

We have computed the minimum track-wire distance in two ways:

1. Ddrif t, using the drift time measurement (according the average drift

velocity quoted above);

2. DSi, using the track reconstructed from pixel readout.

If we plot Ddrif t versus DSi as in the top panel of Fig. 4, a clear devia-
tion from linearity is observed. We made the assumption that the required

6

correction depends only on the cell geometry, the gas mixture and the high
voltage, being independent of the speciﬁc cell used. Under this hypothesis we
considered together the data from the two cells and a correction as a a func-
tion of DSi was introduced to restore linearity. Such correction is achieved
by ﬁtting the scatter plot with a piece-wise linear ﬁt, so that 2 parameters
for each DSi section are obtained from the law:

L(cm) = p0 + p1

Such procedure can be applied to any streamer tube cell working in an actual
experiment.

4 Experimental results

The overall space accuracy from the drift time measurement can be obtained
from the distribution of the residuals of the ﬁt of Fig. 4 (bottom panel),
summing up all cells.

The results are shown in Fig. 5 for HV = 5500 V and 5900 V. The
5)µm for
gaussian ﬁts give a resolution of σtot=(271
HV = 5500, 5900 V respectively. The standard deviation of such distri-
butions can be written as σtot= qσ2
Si= 271 µm (207 µm). Since

7)µm and σtot=(207

drif t + σ2

±

±

the silicon pixel size is 330 µm the ideal contribution of σSi to σtot would be
σSi=330 µm/√12/√2=68 µm and hence the intrinsic space resolution achiev-
able with the drift time method would be σdrif t= qσ2
σ2
Si=262 µm (195
µm). Taking into account also the expected muon momentum distribution
(< Eµ >
1 GeV) and the multiple scattering inside the silicon and the
chamber walls, we obtain an average value of σSi=94. The estimated value
of σdrif t then improves and it is σdrif t=254 µm (184 µm).

∼

We also tried to measure σdrif t as a function of the X distance from the
wire, selecting diﬀerent track samples on the basis of the track parameters
reconstructed with the silicon detector. In order to maintain an high eﬃ-
ciency and reliability of the streamer tubes system in large area detectors,
the HV has to be kept within the plateau, so we did not attempt to go beyond
HV=5900 V. The results are shown in Fig. 6. We can identify at 5900 V an
optimal σdrif t in the central part of the tube, i.e. X
0.7 cm. At lower X,
the resolution is spoiled by a probable non linear space–time relation, while
at large X it is aﬀected by the reduced electrical ﬁeld in proximity of the cell
walls and corners. The resolution improves increasing the HV, due to the
reinforcement of the electric ﬁeld in the cell wall neighbourhood.

≃

In order to verify these hypotheses, we simulated the expected drift ve-
locity as a function of distance from the wire using the GARFIELD package.
To take into account the trigger acceptance, we used an angular distribution
taken from real data tracks, reconstructed with the silicon pixel detector.
The (x,y) position corresponding to the minimal distance from the wire was
estimated for each track and used as input to the GARFIELD simulation.
The curve in Fig.7 shows the simulated drift velocity as a function of the
distance from the wire, for HV=5500 V. The simulation is obtained chang-
ing the Isobutane fraction in the gas mixture from 40% to 60 %. An higher
fraction of quenching gas reﬂects in a smaller drift velocity at low electric
ﬁeld (i.e. near the tube walls). The experimental data are in satisfactory
agreement with the GARFIELD simulation. The space resolution quoted
above could be in principle slightly spoiled in a longer streamer cell, due to

8

the wire sagitta.

5 Discussion and conclusions

The performance of a large streamer tube cell in drift mode have been tested
using an high precision silicon telescope: space resolution between 150 µm
and 350 µm have been obtained, depending on the HV applied and on the
track distance from the wire.

Such quite good resolution, can be anyway spoiled, when using streamer

tubes in drift mode for real spectrometers:
a) In case of longer tubes, the practically achievable resolution is deteriorated
by the wire sag position determination. This problem is always present in
any long tube: the relevance of such eﬀects depends on the geometry of the
tube. Should the magnetic ﬁeld deﬂection lye in the same plane where the
gravitational force applies, the resolution deterioration would be more severe.
b) Concerning non superconducting spectrometer, equipped with iron, the
space resolution is deteriorated by δ-rays and electrons-positrons pairs pro-
duced in the magnetic ﬁeld iron yoke, penetrating inside the cell. When a
muon crosses the cell close to the walls, such particles may result in earlier
streamer avalanches, producing thus shorter drift times.
c) As it has been pointed out in [6], inclined tracks may hit streamer tube
cells at diﬀerent coordinates along the wires, introducing thus additional de-
lays. Due to the relatively fast signal velocity transmission along the wire,
25 cm/ns, compared to standard drift velocity, a rough knowledge of the
1m) is required to recover the full

≃
coordinate of the event along the wire, (
resolution.

≃

Summarizing, although realistic spectrometers equipped with streamer
tubes operating in drift mode, may suﬀer the space resolution deterioration
quoted above, the expected resolution is anyway well below 1 mm. Taking
into the account the multiple scattering suﬀered by muons in the iron, such
resolution is still adequate to fulﬁll the requirements for massive iron spec-

9

trometers for neutrino physics, indicating streamer tubes in drift mode as a
possible choice for particle tracking in muon charge and momentum analysis.

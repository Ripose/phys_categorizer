Abstract

We present measurements of drift velocities and gains in gas mixtures based on Ar
and Xe, with CO2, CH4, and N2 as quenchers, and compare them with calculations.
In particular, we show the dependence of Ar- and Xe-CO2 drift velocities and gains
on the amount of nitrogen contamination in the gas, which in real experiments
may build up through leaks. A quantiﬁcation of the Penning mechanism which
contributes to the Townsend coeﬃcients of a given gas mixture is proposed.

Key words: drift chambers, drift velocity, gas gain, Xe-CO2 mixtures, Nitrogen
contamination, Penning transfer

1 Introduction

Modern detectors such as those being constructed for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
include large-volume gaseous detectors which are expected to operate continuously for
several months every year. The required performance of these detectors usually involves
the precise control and monitoring of the drift velocity and the gain. These relevant
gas parameters depend on the detector ﬁeld conﬁguration and on the gas components,
composition, density, and purity. The gas mixtures used in these detectors, driven by
performance, may contain a high cost component which makes it important to recirculate
the gas in a closed loop, with a modest rate of fresh gas injection. This mode of operation
results, if no gas envelope is foreseen around the detector, in an increasing amount of air
in the gas volume, entering through leaks, however small these are. While oxygen can
be readily removed by appropriate ﬁlters, the known methods for nitrogen removal are
complex and tedious, and lead to further losses of the main gas and to the modiﬁcation
of its composition. The latter circumstance is particularly undesirable during data tak-
ing periods. Thus, nitrogen gradually builds up into the mixture. The operation of the

detector, namely the charge transport and ampliﬁcation processes, may therefore change
during running periods.

A case in point is the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) [1], which is designed
to provide electron identiﬁcation and particle tracking in the high-multiplicity environ-
ment of Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. To achieve these goals, accurate pulse height
measurements over the full drift time (order of 2 µs) in wire chambers operated with a
Xe-CO2 [85-15] gas is necessary. Therefore, knowledge of both the drift velocity and the
gas gain is important. The large volume (28 m3) of this barrel detector and the high cost
of xenon makes it mandatory to recirculate the gas mixture, and to limit the injection of
fresh gas to replenish what is lost through leaks only. In this case, the nitrogen concen-
tration in the mixture would reach 8 % after a running period of 8 months. Most of this
nitrogen may be cryogenically distilled and removed from the mixture during the shut-
down periods, at a moderate loss of xenon. Since the gas mixture during running periods
contains a varying admixture of N2, studies of the inﬂuence of N2 on the gas properties
become very important.

In the following section we describe the experimental method used to measure both the
drift velocity and the gain of various gas mixtures. In section 3 we show the measured
drift velocities. Measurements of drift velocities in some binary and ternary Xe-based
mixtures (without nitrogen) have been published earlier [2,3,4,5]. We compare our results
to existing data where available and to simulations, in order to validate our method. The
gain measurements, together with results from simulations, are presented in section 4. We
ﬁnally draw our conclusions.

2 Experimental setup

The experimental results are obtained using a small drift chamber with a geometry similar
to that anticipated for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD [1], but with a much smaller active area
(10×10 cm2). The chamber has a drift region of 31.5 mm and an ampliﬁcation region of
6.4 mm. The anode wires (W-Au, 20 µm diameter) have a pitch of 5 mm. For the cathode
wires (Cu-Be, 75 µm diameter) the pitch is 2.5 mm. The signal is read out on a cathode
plane segmented into rectangular pads of area 6 cm2. The drift electrode is made of a
25 µm aluminized Kapton foil, which also serves as gas barrier. The electric ﬁeld thus
created is suﬃciently uniform over the full active area of the pad plane.

A schematic view of the setup used for the drift velocity measurements is presented in
Fig. 1. Two sets of slits, 0.75 mm wide, are machined into the stesalit side walls of the
drift region and covered with Kapton foils. Electrons from a collimated 90Sr radioactive
source enter the drift volume through either of these slits, and ionise the gas. Some of
these particles cross the corresponding slit at the other side of the drift enclosure, behind
which a scintillator is placed for triggering purposes. Triggered events will show signals in
the 8 pads under the track, with a drift time corresponding, on average, to the distance

from the selected set of slits to the anode plane. A 2 mm thick lead absorber is placed
behind the opposite outlet slit to prevent triggers from particles going at an angle through
the detector. For each set of slits, we record on FADCs the pulse height distributions on
the pads as a function of the drift time of the tracks. The corresponding average times
are evaluated and then subtracted. In this way, the contribution to the drift time of the
ampliﬁcation region, where the electric ﬁeld is not uniform, is cancelled. The anode voltage
is adjusted for each mixture to achieve a gain near 104, and ranges between 1450 V and
1800 V. Both the pad plane and the cathode wires are kept at ground potential. The
ampliﬁcation ﬁeld leaks through the cathode wire plane and eﬀectively increases the drift
ﬁeld. In order to correct for this eﬀect, the position of the 0 Volts equipotential line,
relative to the position of the cathode wires, is computed with the Garﬁeld simulation
package [6] for each set of anode and drift voltages. This shift, which depends on both
the drift and anode voltages, ranges in our case from 0.02 mm to 6 mm. The reduced
electric ﬁeld is ﬁnally evaluated with the recorded ambient pressure. The oxygen and
water vapour in the gas was monitored during the measurements, and varied, depending
on the gas ﬂow, between 10 and 50 ppm O2, and 300 to 500 ppm H2O. The resulting drift
velocity, measured as a function of the reduced electric ﬁeld, has an uncertainty estimated
to be lower than 10 %.

The gain is measured with an 55Fe source, by counting the number of signals produced by
X-rays absorbed in the gas, and measuring the currents drawn by the anode high voltage
power supply due to these photons. Typical rates are 60 kHz in a projected area of order
1 cm2. The number of primary electrons per photon produced in the gas is derived for
each mixture separately using the work functions given in [7]. The drift voltage during
these measurements was set at -2 kV.

We use a prototype of the charge-sensitive preampliﬁer/shaper (PASA) especially designed
and built for TRD prototypes with discrete components. It has a noise on-detector of
about 2000 electrons r.m.s. and the FWHM of the output pulse is about 120 ns for an
input step function. The nominal gain of the PASA is 3 mV/fC. The FADC has an 8-bit
non-linear conversion and adjustable baseline, and runs at 100 MHz sampling frequency.

3 Drift velocity measurements

In order to validate our experimental method, we ﬁrst measured the drift velocity of a well
known mixture, Ar-CH4 [90-10], and compared our results with existing data [5] that we
refer to as MIT data. We also compare the measurements with Magboltz [8] calculations.
We show our results without and with the correction of the reduced ﬁeld due to the leakage
of the anode ﬁeld into the drift region. This correction is higher at lower drift ﬁelds. As
can be seen in Fig. 2, the agreement between this work and the calculation is good only
after the correction of the drift ﬁeld values. On the other hand, a clear discrepancy with
the MIT data is visible at low ﬁelds, and reaches 10 %.

scattering of electrons coming for the 90Sr source is signiﬁcant in xenon. This eﬀect, in
combination with the asymmetric gas volume available for tracks emerging from either
slit, biases the measurement towards larger drift velocities by, in this case, as much as
15 %. For this reason, we work with drift time distributions measured on the pad closest
to the entrance slit only, where multiple scattering is minimal. The argon data showed
no diﬀerence, within 2 %, in the results obtained from any pad, meaning that the drift
ﬁeld is uniform enough in the regions above the pads at the edges of the active area. The
resulting drift velocity and its comparisons are shown in Fig. 3. There is again a signiﬁcant
discrepancy between our measurement and the MIT results at ﬁelds above drift velocity
saturation. However, the calculations of the drift velocity in this region are compatible
with the measurement of this work. At low ﬁelds, on the contrary, the MIT data agree
well with the calculation, whereas our results underestimate the calculated values by 7 %
near 0.45 V/cm/mbar.

The next set of measurements were undertaken for Ar-CO2 [85-15] and admixtures of 0,
10 and 20 % N2. Adding, for example, 10 % N2 into the mixture results in an Ar-CO2-N2
[76.5-13.5-10] mixture. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the drift velocity decreases with increasing
concentration of nitrogen, and there is a reasonable agreement between measurements and
simulation. Due to the saturation of the drift velocity at lower values with increasing N2
content, keeping the drift velocity constant would require higher and higher drift voltages
as the gas composition changes, and to maintain a fast mixture would eventually become

impossible.

Finally, the results for Xe-CO2 [85-15] mixtures with 0, 10 and 20 % N2 admixtures, shown
in Fig. 5, exhibit a weak dependence on the nitrogen concentration. We notice deviations
of up to 12 % with respect to the calculations at intermediate ﬁelds. The calculated drift
velocities exhibit a crossing of the three curves at a ﬁeld near 800 V/cm. The measurements
show very little dependence of the drift velocity on the N2 concentration at ﬁelds up to this
value. Since, for example, the anticipated electric ﬁeld of the ALICE TRD is 700 V/cm,
this circumstance should be welcome: the change in drift velocity due to substantial
accumulations of nitrogen would be negligible in this case.

4 Gain measurements

As explained in the introduction, the absolute gain as a function of the anode voltage is
measured with the use of a 55Fe source, which is placed in front of the entrance window
of the chamber. We have also carried out calculations of the gain with the use of the
package Magboltz 2 [8]. This program computes the Townsend coeﬃcient for a given gas
mixture and electric ﬁeld. By introducing this information, together with the chamber
geometry and voltages, into Garﬁeld [6], one can calculate the gain of the detector for
each mixture and anode voltage. The multiplication factor obtained this way accounts

for the electrons produced in the avalanche by collisions of atoms or molecules with other
energetic electrons. In addition, Magboltz 2 provides information about the excited and
ionised species produced in the avalanche. This information can be used to scale up the
Townsend coeﬃcients, according to the ionisation of gas species due to collisions with other
excited metastable gas states (Penning eﬀect) [9,10,11]. Since this energy transfer rate is
a priori not known, the experimental data are used as a guide to tune one parameter,
the so-called Penning fraction, for matching the calculations to the measurements. The
Penning fraction refers to the amount of a given excited species which eﬀectively ionise
an atom or molecule, normalised to the abundance of such species and provided the
energy balance of the process allows for the reaction. It should be noted, though, that
this parameter is unique for a given gas mixture, i.e. it does not depend on the electric ﬁeld
nor the high voltage, and that it is expected to vary according to the characteristics of the
quencher(s) and noble gas used in the mixture. In other words, the Penning transfer can
be regarded as a measure of how well a quencher works: light noble gases tend, through
their excited states, to ionise quenchers such as CO2, and therefore the Penning fraction
in these mixtures are expected to be relatively large. On the other hand, heavy noble
gases will tend to be ionised, probably to a lower extent, by excited molecules of certain
quenchers (Penning mixtures).

In the case of Ar-CO2-N2 mixtures, the suggested Penning mechanism to provide extra
gain is the reaction Ar∗ + CO2 → Ar + CO2
+ + e−, where the average excitation energy
of the Ar D-levels is 14.0 eV and the ionisation potential of CO2 is 13.773 eV. Fig. 6 shows

the measured and calculated gain as a function of anode voltage for the three argon-based
mixtures. As can be observed, after tuning of the Penning fraction to the second highest
point in each curve, the slopes are properly matched by the calculations. The Penning
fraction decreases from 37 % in the case of no nitrogen to 8 % when the N2 admixture
is 20 %. This means that nitrogen limits the Penning ionisation of CO2. This eﬀect may
occur by quenching of the excited argon states by N2 or by the occasional excitation of
the nitrogen molecule thus leaving the argon atom unexcited. The highest excitation level
in N2 used in the calculations corresponds to 13.0 eV. The diﬀerence in voltage for equal
gain in this series of mixtures is about 200 V, and apparently this gap increases with the
gain.

Shown also in Fig. 6 are the calculated gains with no Penning eﬀects, which fail to re-
produce the measurements. In addition, the slopes, at least for the nitrogen free case, are
less steep than the experimental ones, and the disagreement of the calculations with the
measurements decreases with increasing N2 concentrations. Thus, the eﬀect of nitrogen
in this mixture, apart from lowering the gain at a given voltage, is to reduce the Penning
eﬀect by providing more eﬀective quenching.

The case of the Xe-CO2-N2 mixtures is, from the Penning transfer point of view, diﬀerent
from argon. In this case, the highest energy level of excited Xe is 11.7 eV, insuﬃcient

8

to ionise CO2. Levels in CO2 between the Xe ionisation energy, 12.13 eV, and the CO2
ionisation at 13.773 eV have suﬃcient energy to cause xenon ionisation. Unfortunately,
due to the lack of data, all CO2 excitations above 10.5 eV have been combined into
a single level at 10.5 eV [12,13] in the simulation program. This does not exclude an
analysis similar to the previous mixture since only a fraction of the excitation of the
10.5 eV level representing levels above 12.13 eV are used in the simulation. In conclusion
we assume that the Penning transfer occurs from CO∗
2(10.5) onto ionisation of xenon. The
eﬀect of N2 on the Xe-CO2 mixture is quite complex. There are possible energy transfer
channels from CO∗
2 to N2 as in the Ar-CO2 mixture but also from N∗
2 to ionisation of
Xe. The nitrogen excited states are produced less copiously than the CO2 excited states
according to calculations done with Magboltz 2. Therefore as an approximation we assume
the dominating transfer is from CO∗

2 to Xe.

The experimental gain measurements, and the calculations performed under these as-
sumptions, shown in Fig. 7, give an approximately constant Penning fraction (22 %). All
slopes are correctly reproduced, with and without Penning transfer. The voltage gaps
between the curves is about 50 Volts. The deviation of the data from the calculation
-tuned at the middle point of each curve- at high gains is probably an indication of space
charge eﬀects within the ampliﬁcation region due to the high X-ray rates. It is interesting
to note that this measured deviation from exponential behaviour seems to decrease with
increasing N2 concentration, probably due to the higher anode ﬁelds involved. This also
implicates space charge as the cause.

5 Conclusions

Drift velocity and gain measurements have been performed for a number of gas mixtures
in order to assess the eﬀect of nitrogen admixture in the gas. In particular, the drift
velocity measurements presented in this work show a reasonable agreement with calcu-
lations performed with Magboltz, although signiﬁcant discrepancies are clearly visible in
some cases. Our measurements have been corrected for the eﬀect of the ampliﬁcation ﬁeld
leaking between the cathode wires. The eﬀect of the multiple scattering of sub-MeV elec-
trons in xenon has been reduced to a negligible level. In the case of Xe-CO2 mixtures, the
variation of the drift velocity as a function of the N2 admixture turns out to practically
vanish at ﬁelds below 800 V/cm.

Gain measurements have been performed with mixtures with CO2 and admixtures of N2.
A phenomenological quantiﬁcation of the Penning mechanism, namely further ionisation
from excited species formed in the avalanche, has been proposed and calculated with
the Magboltz 2 simulation program. The measured gain curves are not reproduced by
the calculations without this mechanism. Penning transfer is somewhat inhibited by the
presence of N2 in the argon-based mixtures. In the case of the heavier xenon mixtures,
the role of N2 in this respect seems to be negligible.

We would like to acknowledge A. Radu and and J. Hehner for their skills and dedication

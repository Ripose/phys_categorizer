Discovery of a Planar Waveguide for

A simple model of X-Ray standing waves (XSW) formation in the

slit of a planar waveguide of X-Ray radiation beam for the angle area

restricted by the critical total reﬂection angle is developed. It is shown

that the model is true for a case of the Bragg reﬂection. The conditions

required for XSW to appear in the space between two polished parallel

plane plates are formulated and a slit size interval conforming to these

conditions is evaluated. A mechanism of a XSW intensity decrease

in a planar waveguide is proposed. This mechanism explains a high

eﬃciency of slitless collimator application for the transportation of

narrow X-Ray beams.

Some recommendations on the application of the planar X-Ray

waveguide in X-Ray structural and spectral studies of surface are pre-

sented.

Introduction

A slit former of X-Ray beams with extensive plane restraints has long been
used as one of the basic components in X-Ray optics. A well-known example
is the Soller slit that contains a set of closely spaced thin parallel metallic
plates ensuring an X-Ray beam with a required divergence [1, 2]. Another
example of the unit is an aligned diﬀractometric slit 50 mm long with a
clearance size between the parallel quartz plates of 0.1 mm [1, 3].

These slits are sometimes used to form an X-Ray excitation beam in
TXRF spectrometry [4, 5]. For example, an X-Ray collimator formed by
two quartz parallel plates with a 0.1 mm clearance served as a double X-
Ray beam reﬂector to form an excitation beam for total X-Ray reﬂection
ﬂuorescence analysis [4].

In X-Ray diﬀraction practices the plane slit monochromators used for
the X-Ray line narrowing in an excitated beam has a wide application [6, 7].
This devices designates as Bonse-Hart monochromators are distinguished by
multiple reﬂections within a groove cut into a large single crystal or within
a slit formed by two oriented monocrystal plates.

Lately, in addition to X-Ray planar extensive collimators characterized
by the visible size of a clearance between solid reﬂectors formed it, so called
slitless X-Ray collimators has come into use for X-Ray ﬂuorescence analysis
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The slitless collimator applied in those works was formed by
two quartz polished plates mated together. The clearance in it was formed
due to roughness and microsphericity of the plates, which size been made
as evaluation rather laborious and ambiguous. Experiments showed, that
these slitless collimators could transport X-Ray radiation over a distance of
100 mm without visible intensity decrease. Because the hypothesis multiple
total reﬂection of an X-Ray beam in the microclearance of a slitless collimator
failed to explain the experimental data obtained in [8, 10] , a hypothesis of an
X-Ray standing wave (XSW) formation in the microclearance was proposed
in [11, 12]. The present work is devoted to further development of this
hypothesis.

Formation of an X-Ray standing wave upon

specular reﬂection of a plane wave

Assume that an electromagnetic monochromatic plane travelling wave with
the σ-polarization (i.e. ~E0 perpendicular to the x-z plane in Fig. 1), wave-

1

length λ0 and wave vector k0 = 1
λ0 impinges on the boundary separating
two materials. If the materials have diﬀerent refraction indices, part of the
wave energy is reﬂected and the remainder passes to the second material or
is refracted. An interference ﬁeld appears in the ﬁrst material irrespective of
the remainder value. The interference ﬁeld area depends on the width of an
incident plane wave and the incidence angle θ. The intensity of the interfer-
ence area is directly determinated by the reﬂection factor on the boundary
between materials and peaks at the total reﬂection of an incident radiation
beam. Referring to Fig. 1a, the incident and reﬂected travelling E-ﬁeld plane
waves can be described as [13]:

and

~A0(~r; t) = ~E0ei[ωt−2π(~kxx−~kzz)]

~AR(~r; t) = ~ERei[ωt−2π(~kxx+~kzz)]

For the sake of convenience, let z = 0 corresponds to the reﬂector surface.
By locating the intersections of the crests and troughs of the two travelling
plane waves in Fig. 1a, one can easily show that the interference between
the two coherent waves generates a standing wave with planes of maximum
and minimum intensity parallel to the boundary surface. The period of the
standing wave is deﬁned by expression [14]:

·
In a general case the amplitude relation between the incident and reﬂected

waves is described by the Fresnel equations [13]:

where ϕ is the refraction angle and n is the relative refraction index. The
phase change of the electric vector between the incident and reﬂected waves
ψ is deﬁned by expression:

Equations (3), (4) and (5) describe the reﬂection phenomenon for any
electromagnetic plane wave on a plane interface between two materials. They
can also be used to describe, as a ﬁrst approximation, a total external X-Ray
reﬂection on a vacuum - material interface, which is usually represented as

The interference ﬁeld can be observed both at θ < θc and θ > θc, but
in the latter angle range its intensity decreases abruptly [17]. The standing

wave period D achieves its minimum at θ = θc in the 0
the incident angle decreases, the period D increases to become inﬁnitely large
at the grazing incident angle (θ = 0). But this is not case in practice, because
the coherence of incidence and reﬂected beams is broken. The most obvious
factor causing the interference ﬁeld erosion is the width ﬁniteness of incident
radiation lines ∆λ [13]. It is generally accepted, that the interference ﬁeld
does not become smeared, if the condition [16]:

Another factor inﬂuencing the interference ﬁeld picture is the roughness
of a reﬂecting surface. Evaluations show that the interference ﬁeld does not

Standing wave formation in the slit of an X-

Ray planar waveguide

A successive reﬂection of a plane electromagnetic wave in the slit formed by
two parallel plates results in the formation of several interference ﬁeld areas
in it (Fig. 1b). Varying the slit size can lead to overlapping the areas to
create the uniform interference ﬁeld zone within the total clearance of the
slit (Fig. 1c)3. So, it can be expected that an XSW excitation can be formed
in the plane slit, when it width falls within a certain range. The minimum
slit size for this can be evaluated from expression (3) for the critical angle of
total reﬂection:

For MoKα radiation, the wavelength is λ = 0.707

max = 36 nm. Similar value for CuKα
radiation is equal to D∗
max = 91 nm. Analogous parameters calculated for
the set of X-Ray and gamma radiation are collected in Table 1. Quartz total
reﬂection parameters peculiar to the radiation set are represented in the same
place. It should be stressed that the X-Ray spectra in incident and emergent
beams do not agree between them. For example, if we shall try to form the
X-Ray beam excited by X-Ray tube with Mo anode by using of an X-Ray
waveguide with a slit size D > Dmax, we shall not ﬁnd the characteristic
deposit in the spectrum of an emergent beam. But if the size will be not
excel the value Dmax (Dmin < D < Dmax), the characteristic radiation MoKα
will be present in the emergent beam X-Ray spectrum with a great intensity.
It can be expected that the slit width varying in a waveguide would cause the
X-Ray spectrum modiﬁcation in the emergent beam at the transportation of
the white X-Ray radiation.

Minimum slit sizes presented in Table 1 (without correction on the X-Ray
depth penetration) are the constant. Maximum values of this parameter are
near 100 nm for the Kα radiation of Fe group elements. Dmax and Dmin mag-
nitudes approach each other for the hard X-Ray radiation (MoKα, AgKα).
The greatest values of Dmax for the gamma radiation have engaged our atten-
tion primarily. A signiﬁcant diﬀerence between Dmax values for X-Ray and
nuclear radiations presents a unique possibility for its separation in compli-
cate spectra, even though the radiation wavelengths coinside.

The absolute values of slit widths obtained by calculations have attracted
a some attantion. The average value of a slit width accommodating an XSW
is only by an order of magnitude higher than the total surface roughness
in an X-Ray waveguide. If taking also into account that polished surfaces
are characterized by macroheterogeneities, the a high eﬃciency of a slitless

Attenuation of an X-Ray standing wave in a

planar slit waveguide

The excitation of a standing wave in a waveguide slit gives rise to a stationary
distribution of the interference ﬁeld intensity both along the slit channel
(along axis x) and crosswise (along axis z). This distribution is pictured in
Fig. 2 to ﬁt the input of a waveguide (x = 0). The distribution is plotted for
a plane X-Ray beam (CuKα) impinging into a slit of the quartz waveguide
θc on the reﬂector surface. The reﬂection conditions

intensity for a standing wave in the cross-section of an X-Ray waveguide. The

Because attenuation of a standing wave occurs only by the absorbtion in

diﬀerent standing wave parts. The attenuation of a standing wave intensity
can then be described by the expression:

W (x) = [L (0) + M (0)] e−αµx

(22)

The magnitude of α depends on the wavelength of incident radiation,
the reﬂector material properties, the angle of radiation impinging and the
width of a waveguide slit. The dependence of α on the incident angle can
be evaluated by calculating its variation with some incident angles area of
CuKα radiation in the quartz waveguide. This gives the values: α(θc) =
0.8; α(θc/2) = 0.05. The value of α decreases abruptly, if the slit width
exceeds the wavelength of a standing wave.

waveguide. The total intensity of a standing wave after passing the way
∆x = 10 mm in the waveguide is W (θc) = 0.3 W0 and W (θc/2) = 0.6 W0.
Note that the model of multiple total successive reﬂection under similar con-
ditions gives: W0 ·
The calculated data for the total intensity attenuation of an XSW in a
waveguide lend an explanation of the high eﬃciency of X-Ray slitless col-
limators for X-Ray radiation transport over long distances [8, 10, 11, 12].
However, the evaluations of clearance sizes between the mated quartz plates
in those works strongly disagree (D
150 nm [8]). More-
≃
over, the slit width in the collimators is not a stable parameter and can vary
along the collimator length. Therefore, the evaluations of quantity parame-
ters of the emergent beam intensities for a slitless collimator must be treated
with caution. In addition, note that the slit width variation can bring about
a considerable modiﬁcation of the X-Ray spectrum of an emergent beam, if
the initial X-Ray radiation is a mixed type (white and characteristics).

The above results help to elucidate the advantages and shortcomings of
X-Ray slitless collimators. Moreover, they can become the basis for an X-
Ray waveguide designing with properties predicted and high intensity of an

Application aspects of a planar X-Ray radia-

tion waveguide

An X-Ray slitless collimator is an X-Ray planar waveguide with an uncon-
trolled size of the waveguide slit, which, can be varied during one experiment.
Although these variations are not great, an X-Ray slitless collimator should
be regarded as a simple and convenient experimental model. For practical
purposes, slit waveguides are needed with the greatest possible slit size for
a chosen wavelength. Quartz waveguides with slit sizes 36 nm and 91 nm
are best suited for MoKα and CuKα radiations, respectively. To manufacture
such waveguides, the metal thin strips are deposited on to edges of one quartz
reﬂector of a waveguide, and then the waveguide is uniformly compressed be-
tween metal plates. The clearance magnitude of a slit can be controlled by
the Optical Attenuated Total Reﬂection method [19].

An X-Ray slitless collimator came into use for X-Ray ﬂuorescence analy-
sis of plane surfaces and thin ﬁlms (TXRF-SC analysis) some years ago [10].
The substitution of the slitless collimator by an X-Ray waveguide consider-
ably increases X-Ray radiation density on the surface of a target analyzed
and ensures the diagnostic reproduction. Furthermore, an X-Ray waveguide
helps avoid the target contact with reﬂector surfaces. Otherwise, an X-Ray
planar waveguide retains all advantages of a slitless collimator in TXRF spec-
troscopy. But it is notice that the spurious peaks do not disappear of the
waveguide application.

Another important ﬁeld of a planar waveguide application is in X-Ray
diﬀraction research. It can be used for structure investigation of monocrys-
tal surfaces and epitaxial ﬁlms at the total reﬂection of an incident X-Ray
beam in the parallel and perpendicular geometries [20] because a waveguide
ensures high X-Ray radiation density in the beam. One more application
is for X-Ray energy-dispersive diﬀractometry of polycrystal thin ﬁlms be-
cause this waveguide is a beautiful former of a narrow high intensity beam
of the “white” X-Ray radiation. The planar X-Ray waveguide holds greatest
promise for using in commercial diﬀractometers for symmetrical and asym-
metrical geometries.

Special choice of materials for the reﬂectors top layers is liable to provide
pseudo-monochromatization of X-Ray radiation in an emergent beam. The
waveguide-X-Ray concentrator may be preparated by a surface implantation
of reﬂectors plates with variation of high number ion concentration (Pb, Bi)
alone of its length (n – variation in top layers).

Planar X-Ray Waveguide – Monochromator

Preceding sections are devoted to discussion of the planar X-Ray waveguide
using the total X-Ray reﬂection phenomenon for the standing wave genera-
tion in a slit space of the device. But it is well known that the excitation of
X-Ray standing wave is possible for the Bragg geometry too [21]. The X-Ray
standing wave arises in a slit space between two parallel polished reﬂectors, if
the reﬂectors are perfect monocrystal been orientated mutually. The mech-
anism of the standing wave formation in Bragg reﬂection conditions is not
practically diﬀered from one in the case of a total X-Ray reﬂection (Fig. 1).
But a formal consideration of a standing wave formation in Bragg planar
X-Ray waveguide (waveguide-monochromator) requests replacement of the
X-Ray depth penetration parameter ze on the parameter of the primary ex-
tinction length zext [22]:

where σ is the extinction factor, c is the polarization factor been equal to
unity for a σ-polarization, c is the light velocity, m and e are the electron
characteristics, v is the unit cell volume for the reﬂector material, Fh is the
relative structure factor of the chosen reﬂection. The zext magnitude de-
ﬁnes the crystal thickness attenuated of the X-Ray beam intensity falling on
the crystal under Bragg angle with ¡¡e¿¿ factor. It is signiﬁcantly that the
primary extinction length is not depended on a wavelength of an X-Ray ra-
diation. Magnitudes of the primary extinction length are usually two orders
higher as values of the depth penetration at the X-Ray total reﬂection. For
example, the magnitude of zext for (200) NaCl reﬂection is equal to 660 nm
[22]. Because of this, the practical size of a waveguide-monochromator slit
may be visibly diﬀered from one calculated and its eﬃciency must be lower
as compared to a waveguide built on the total reﬂection phenomenon. But
the X-Ray radiation density in its emergent beam will be signiﬁcantly higher
as one for the conventional Bonse-Hart monochromator. The planar X-
Ray waveguide-monochromator application is conceptually iden-
tical with the Borrmann eﬀect maniﬁstation in perfect crystals
[23, 24]. Authors hope to give a comprehensive analysis of peculiarities
which are typical for the planar X-Ray waveguide-monochromator in other
work.

Conclusion

The model of XSW excitation in a planar slit waveguide has been developed
by employing the interference wave theory to treat areas whose size consider-
ably exceeds the wavelength of initial radiation but the coherence conditions
are still valid. An example of practical embodiment of the idea of such a
waveguide is an X-Ray slitless collimator whose unique properties could only
be explained in terms of the model of XSW excitation. The evaluation of the
upper and lower boundaries for the slit width which provide XSW excitation,
points out the way to waveguides building with most eﬃcient for particular
purposes.

The presented model is a simple one and disregards some phenomena as
such existence of the X-Ray interference ﬁeld in top layers of waveguide re-
ﬂectors, the Goos-Hanchen eﬀect, monotonous modiﬁcation of the refraction
index on a vacuum-material interface [25] and others. However, even the
simpliﬁed evaluations made in the work show that a planar X-Ray waveg-
uide and a waveguide-monochromator can became useful tools for the X-Ray
diﬀraction and spectroscopic investigations, especially for the work with syn-
chrotron radiation.

It is very important that the model can be applicated for the
neutron and electron beams and will stimulate the waveguides cre-
ation both for the white radiation and for the monochromatic one
for them. The waveguide-monochromator can be basis for the building of
a laser pumping system applicated for the hard X-Ray and gamma radia-
tion. The idea of the simplest X-Ray accumulator functioned on base of the
waveguide-monochromator will be described in another place.

Direct experiments with planar X-Ray waveguides is carried out today

and will be published soon after.

Captions to the Figures

Figure 1. Classical scheme of the standing wave ﬁeld formation at a spec-
ular reﬂection of a plane monochromatic wave above the mirror
surface (a), a scheme of the standing wave ﬁeld formation at mul-
tiple successive reﬂection of a plane monochromatic wave (b), the
principle scheme explaining the formation of the standing wave
uniform zone upon trapping monochromatic plane wave radiation
by a planar extensive waveguide (c).

Figure 2. Intensity distribution function for an XSW in a waveguide slit and
a top layer of quartz reﬂectors for an X-Ray beam impinging on
the slit under a certain angle of total reﬂection θ for the quartz
reﬂectors. The function without absorbtion upon total reﬂection
is shown by a dashed line. The function reﬂects the picture for
λ = 0.1541 nm (CuKα); θ = 0.92

θc; s = 97 nm.

Abstract

We report on the design and performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter
timing readout system (EMTiming) for the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF).
The system will be used in searches for rare events with high energy photons to verify
that the photon is in time with the event collision, to reject cosmic ray and beam
halo backgrounds, and to allow direct searches for new heavy long-lived particles
that decay to photons. The installation and commissioning of all 862 channels was
completed in Fall 2004 as part of an upgrade to the Run II version of the detector.

1 Introduction

for

Timing readout

the electromagnetic
(EM) calorimeters [1,2] was recently installed as
part of an upgrade to the Run II version of the Col-
lider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) [3]. This system,
known as EMTiming [4], is similar to the existing
hadronic calorimeter system [5] but has a resolution
of less than a nanosecond and covers the central

< 1.1) and plug (PEM, 1.1 <
(CEM,
portions of the calorimeter, where η =
ln tan(θ/2),
and θ is the angle from the beamline.

The design of the EMTiming system is op-
timized for searches for production of new particles
that decay into high energy photons as would be
the case in some models of Supersymmetry or Large
Extra Dimensions [6]. Final state particles from all
proton anti-proton collisions typically traverse the
CDF detector and the EMTiming system records the
time of arrival for those that deposit large amounts
of energy in the EM calorimeter. To improve the
search sensitivity and robustness, the system can
verify that all photons (or other energy) are from
the primary collision [7] and reject and estimate the
rate of cosmic ray and beam-related backgrounds.
In addition, the system also allows for a new class
of searches for heavy, long-lived particles that decay
to photons via their delayed time of arrival [8].

In the following sections we describe the var-
ious components of the EMTiming system and the
system performance from its ﬁrst four months of op-
eration. In Sections 2 - 4 we give an overview of the
system and describe the path of the calorimeter sig-
nals through the various components in the system,
with particular emphasis on the diﬀerences between
the CEM and PEM systems which were originally
built with diﬀerent readout. In Section 5 we describe
the preliminary system performance as measured us-
ing collision data in-situ.

2 Overview of the System

Particles from the collision that deposit en-
ergy in the EM calorimeters create light within the
scintillators [1,2] that can be used for a timing mea-

2

surement. Photo-multiplier tubes (PMTs) collect
this light and eﬀectively convert the particle energy
into an analog signal. Prior to the installation of
the EMTiming system this signal was only used as
part of the energy measurement. The EMTiming
system, shown schematically in ﬁg. 1, routes a copy
of the PMT signal to a passive Transition Board
(TB) and Ampliﬁer-Shaper-Discriminator board
(ASD) pair that, in turn, sends their signal to a
ﬁxed-start Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) board
for a timing measurement.

The system design takes into account the dif-
ferences between the existing CEM and PEM read-
out while trying to make the overall system as uni-
form and modular as possible. While the PEM, as-
sembled for the beginning of Run II, was designed
with a timing upgrade in mind, the CEM was not.
In Section 3 we describe the diﬀerences between the
PMT outputs for the CEM and PEM, and the de-
signs used to get a timing signal out of the PMTs
and onto the ASD boards. In Section 4 we describe
the boards that collect the signals from the PMTs,
amplify, shape, combine and use them as input to
the discriminator, and output the results to a TDC.
Table 1 provides a summary of the system speciﬁca-
tions.

Fig. 1. A schematic diagram of the EMTiming system
hardware on the CDF detector. Note that the CEM
PMTs use “splitter” outputs (described in Section 3) to
send their signals to the discriminators through transi-
tion boards, while the PEM uses dynode outputs.

Table 1
Overview of the EMTiming system hardware and performance. Note that the calorimeter is physically segmented
into 1,246 “towers”, and that each timing channel consists of two input PMTs for each ASD/TDC output line. As
described in Section 5.1 the eﬃciency for a time to be recorded is energy dependent and is well described by an
eﬃciency plateau, threshold and width. All channels have a plateau which is
100% eﬃcient, and the uncertainties
listed for the threshold and width values represent the channel-to-channel variation in the system. As described in
Section 5.2 the timing resolution asymptotically improves as a function of energy, and the numbers quoted here
are for energies above 10 GeV and 6 GeV for the CEM and PEM respectively. For more details on the CEM and
PEM calorimeters see Refs. [1,2].

3 The CEM and PEM PMT Output Signals

As described in table 1, the CEM and PEM
have both diﬀerent designs and PMT readouts. In
the CEM, the original PMT bases are custom de-
signed 1 and only provide an anode output via a
LEMO connector. In the PEM, the system was de-
signed with the dynode signal already available us-
ing AMP connector units.

In order to continue to use the pre-existing
CEM hardware, we designed an inductive signal
“splitter” board that is placed between the PMT
base and the original 25 ft RG174 cable that carries
the anode signal for an energy measurement. The
splitter eﬀectively routes a fractional portion of the
PMT pulse energy for timing use, while not aﬀect-
ing the energy measurement. As shown in ﬁg. 2 the

1 We note that these bases were built almost 20 years
prior to the EMTiming installation, and are largely un-
modiﬁed since then.

anode cable is connected, via LEMO, to a printed
circuit board where the primary and shield wires are
separated. The primary line is then passed through
a small circular ferrite after which the wires are re-
joined. A secondary wire is wound around the ferrite

measurement. Note that RG174 refers to the coaxial ca-

output is used for the timing measurement and is the
input to the transition boards.

so that a signal from the PMT anode inductively
generates a voltage for timing use. This secondary
signal is sent via RG174 with a cable length that
varies between 23 and 36 feet to the TBs depending
on the PMT location on the detector. The split-
ter solution avoids potential ground-loop problems
since there is no electrical contact between the tim-
ing and energy readout lines. All cables have LEMO
connectors on each end to facilitate installation.

The secondary pulse used for the timing mea-
surement has a voltage that is 15% of the primary
signal. Since the two lines are only inductively cou-
pled, and the energy measurement is done with a
charge integration device [9], in principle this solu-
tion should not aﬀect the energy measurement since
no charge can be lost. To test this, test stand com-
parisons of the integrated charge for a PMT pulse,
with and without a splitter, were performed at var-
ious points over the full energy integration range.
There was no observed (systematic or otherwise) ef-
fect on the linearity or resolution for all energies,
with a measurement uncertainty of approximately
10% of the 1σ variation in the charge integration
measurement itself (for a given energy).

The PEM was designed with a potential tim-
ing upgrade in mind. The dynode outputs from each
PMT are collected in groups of 16 and made avail-
able for connection via oﬀ-the-shelf AMP connec-
tors. The individual dynode outputs are then sent
via 25 ft RG174 cables to the TBs and connected
via LEMOs.

4 Signal Discrimination and Transfer to the

TDC

Beginning with the transition boards the
remaining system components, including the ASD
boards, the long cables and the TDCs, are identical
for the CEM and PEM. The number of boards for
each sub-system is summarized in table 1.

Each TB is capable of taking in the cables
from 48 PMTs. As shown in ﬁg. 3, processing begins
with an RC circuit and a transformer to both help
reduce reﬂections back to the PMT that might oth-
erwise cause a second, erroneous signal to be sent,

4

and to reduce ground-loop or DC oﬀset problems
that might induce a signal to be sent when no en-
ergy is deposited. Each line is passed, via crate back-
plane, to the ASD.

On the ASD the signals from two PMTs are
combined and compared to a threshold with the dig-
ital result sent to the TDC. As shown on the right-
hand side of ﬁg. 3, each PMT signal is ampliﬁed, then
combined in an analog sum with a threshold oﬀset,
and sent to a comparator. This eﬀectively operates
as a ﬁxed-height discriminator with a 2 mV thresh-
old. The resulting signal triggers a monostable with
an output width of 70
10 ns that in turn controls a
National Semiconductor DS90C031 LVDS driver.

±

The output for each channel on an ASD
board is placed on a single 220 ft multiwire twisted
pair cable (3M 3644B/50) that goes from the colli-
sion hall calorimeter crates upstairs to the TDCs. At
this length these cables have a rise time of
50 ns.
However, test bench studies show that as long as
the input LVDS signal width is >50 ns, then we ex-
pect negligible data-transfer loss and timing jitter
of <30 ps. The receiver chip set is located on one of
the standard CDF 96 channel TDCs [10] which are
a part of the data acquisition system (DAQ) and
readout for each event.

∼

Fig. 3. A schematic for the signal processing that
occurs on the Transition Board (TB) and Ampli-
ﬁer-Shaper-Discriminator board (ASD). The RC circuit
(R = 150 Ω, C =12 pF) in parallel with a transformer
(1:1) on the TB is designed to reduce noise and reﬂec-
tion problems at the input (Z = 50 Ω). On the ASD
the ampliﬁers and comparator eﬀectively sum the two
PMT signals and discriminate on the leading edge with
a 2 mV threshold.

5 System Performance

Central Electromagnetic Calorimeter

Plug Electromagnetic Calorimeter

The EMTiming system operates at CDF
when the Tevatron is in Collider mode. During
data taking protons and anti-protons collide every
396 ns, on average, at the center of the detector. The
variation in the time and position of the collision
is σtime
25 cm, respectively.
The typical time of ﬂight from the collision point to
the calorimeter is 5 ns and has an RMS variation of
about 0.6 ns. If there is enough energy deposited,
the TDC will record a time of arrival and this time
is straightforwardly corrected for each of the above,
and other, eﬀects.

1.3 ns and σposition

≈

≈

The system operation can be described in
terms of its eﬃciency to record a time, the timing
resolution, and the rate of pathologies. We study
the performance in-situ using collisions that produce
hadrons from jet events, and electrons from Z
ee
and W
eν events. The results presented here rep-
resent the data taken during the ﬁrst four months of
Tevatron running in 2005.

5.1 System Eﬃciency

The eﬃciency, the ratio of events with a time
recorded in the TDC to all events, is a strong func-
tion of the PMT output signal size and is thus en-
ergy dependent. The eﬃciency as a function of the
energy deposited in the tower is shown in the top
part of ﬁg. 4 for the CEM and PEM separately,
and includes all towers together. The distribution is
well described by an error/smeared step function,
Erf (Eth, σ, ǫ), where Eth is the threshold, σ is the
transition width at threshold, and ǫ is the plateau
eﬃciency. We investigated each fully instrumented
tower separately and ﬁnd that the eﬃciency plateaus
at 100% and, as shown in the bottom part of ﬁg. 4,
that the threshold and width values, as determined
from a ﬁt, are quite uniform. Table 1 summarizes
the results.

time recorded in the TDC to all events) as a function
of the energy for the CEM and PEM, and includes all
channels. The bottom two rows show histograms of the

channels and indicate the uniformity of the system.

5.2 Timing Corrections and System Resolution

The time of arrival recorded by the TDC is a
“raw” time and has a 8 ns variation due to diﬀerent
eﬀects. We take into account the dominant eﬀects
to produce a “corrected time” distribution that is
centered at 0 ns for relativistic particles promptly
produced in the collision [4]. The corrected time is
given by:

tcorrected = tRaw + CStart + CEnergy + CEnergy Asymmetry
(1)

CCollision Time,

CTime of Flight

−

where the corrections are described below and deter-
mined on a tower-by-tower basis, unless otherwise
noted, using in-situ data.

•

Since the system uses ﬁxed-start TDCs there is a
constant oﬀset between the average time of arrival

of the energy deposited in the calorimeter and the
TDC start. This constant, CStart, is dominated by
the overall cable lengths and thus can vary greatly
from tower-to-tower.
Since the ASDs use a ﬁxed-height discrimination
method the PMT pulse shape produces a “slew-
ing” that makes the recorded time energy depen-
dent. We use a set of empirically derived constants
given by:

CEnergy =

A1
ln(x)

+

A2
x2

(2)

where A1 and A2 are constants and x is the sum
of the energies from the two PMTs, as measured
in the calorimeter.
PMT energy response diﬀerences as well as the
location within a tower where the particle hits
can also aﬀect the measured time of arrival. We
correct for both eﬀects by taking into account the
energy asymmetry between the towers. We use the
empirically derived functional form:

CEnergy Asymmetry = B0 + B1

x + B2

·

x2, (3)

·

where B0, B1 and B2 are constants and x is the en-
ergy asymmetry of the two PMTs. After the above
corrections the timing distribution is roughly a
Gaussian with an RMS of 1.6 ns.
The arrival time is corrected for the expected
time-of-ﬂight, CTime of Flight, using the measured
collision position from the tracking chamber [11]
and the known calorimeter tower position.
Finally, the measured collision time, CCollision Time,
as measured by the tracking chamber, is sub-
tracted oﬀ on an event-by-event basis.

nations of electrons in the CEM-CEM, CEM-PEM

is 600

respectively, and is consistent between the measure-
ments. This includes the irreducible TDC resolu-
tion of 288 ps (the TDC has a 1 ns binning output,
which corresponds to a 1 ns/√12 = 288 ps) as well
as a negligible contribution to the uncertainty on
CTime of Flight from the vertex position measurement.

Fig. 6 shows the timing resolution as esti-
mated from a higher statistics sample of W
eν
events where the collision time is measured, and cor-
rected for, directly. While the results are consistent
with the distributions in ﬁg. 5 and show that the
timing measurement is well described by a Gaussian
even out to roughly 5σ for the CEM, a few notes
are in order to explain some of the diﬀerences. The
RMS of the distributions are slightly larger as they
include the resolution of the collision time measure-
ment that is slightly larger for the PEM than for
the CEM. In both distributions we have required a
tight match between the electron track and the mea-
sured collision time and position. However, while the
time and position for the electron track can be mea-
sured in the CEM region, only a position measure-
ment is available for tracks in the region covered by
the PEM. Thus, in the bottom part of ﬁg. 6 there
is a second Gaussian in the distribution that corre-
sponds to the case where there are two collisions in
the event that occur at the same position, but well
separated in time; the tracking for the PEM is un-
able to distinguish which is the correct one. This
second Gaussian corresponds, in this case, to 4% of
the events, but should be sample dependent, and has
an RMS that reﬂects the association of the time of
arrival with a random collision time.

Fig. 7 shows the single tower energy resolu-
tion (convoluted with the vertexing time resolution
as in ﬁg. 6) as measured from a mixed sample of jets
and electrons. While the resolution is slightly worse
for low energies, the asymptotic resolution stabilizes
at energies just above 10 GeV and 6 GeV in the
CEM and PEM respectively to values that are very
close to the electron resolution from W ’s.

5.3 Pathologies

Finally, we note the rate of system patholo-
gies. We measure the rate at which the system
records a time when there is no energy recorded
(the fake rate) by the DAQ to be typically less than
one occurrence in 108 collisions, per tower. We note
however that this rate can rise to one in 107 if we
allow cases where there is some evidence that the
energy is not properly readout by the DAQ. The
rate at which multiple times are recorded for a sin-

as discussed in the text.

gle energy deposit, presumably from reﬂections, is
roughly the same as the fake rate, but can be as
high as one in 105 collisions for a few (<10) towers.
However, this is easily corrected for in the ﬁnal data
analysis.

out for the CDF electromagnetic calorimeters with
good uniformity and resolution. It has its 50% eﬃ-

Fig. 7. The timing resolution as a function of energy.
Note that the resolution, as in ﬁg. 6, contains a contri-
bution from the uncertainty in the collision time that
is diﬀerent for the CEM and PEM. In each case the
asymptotic value is the same as the electron resolution
in ﬁg. 6.

±

10 ps and 610

cient well above threshold. After a full set of cor-
rections we ﬁnd 600
10 ps timing
resolutions, respectively, with only small deviations
from a Gaussian distribution. There are very few
pathologies observed in the data such as recording a
time when no energy is deposited or recording mul-
tiple times for a single energy deposit. The system
is well understood and ready for searches for new
particles that decay to photons.

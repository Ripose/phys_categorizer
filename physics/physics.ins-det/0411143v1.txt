Abstract— Charge collection measurements performed on heav-
ily irradiated p-spray DOFZ pixel sensors with a grazing angle
hadron beam provide a sensitive determination of the electric ﬁeld
within the detectors. The data are compared with a complete
charge transport simulation of the sensor which includes signal
trapping and charge induction effects. A linearly varying electric
ﬁeld based upon the standard picture of a constant type-inverted
effective doping density is inconsistent with the data. A two-trap
double junction model implemented in the ISE TCAD software can
be tuned to produce a doubly-peaked electric ﬁeld which describes
the data reasonably well. The modeled ﬁeld differs somewhat
from previous determinations based upon the transient current
technique. The model can also account for the level of charge
trapping observed in the data.

I. INTRODUCTION

I N the recent years, detectors consisting of one and two

dimensional arrays of silicon diodes have come into
widespread use as tracking detectors in particle and nuclear
physics experiments. It is well understood that the intra-diode
electric ﬁelds in these detectors vary linearly in depth reaching
a maximum value at the p-n junction. The linear behavior
is a consequence of a constant space charge density, Neﬀ,
caused by thermodynamically ionized impurities in the bulk
material. It is well known that the detector characteristics are
affected by radiation exposure, but it is generally assumed
that the same picture is valid after irradiation. In fact, it is

common to characterize the effects of irradiation in terms of a
varying effective charge density. The use of Neﬀ to characterize
radiation damage has persisted despite a growing body of
evidence [1]- [6] that the electric ﬁeld does not vary linearly as
a function of depth after heavy irradiation but instead exhibits
maxima at both n+ and p+ implants. The work presented in
this paper demonstrates conclusively that the standard picture
does not provide a good description of irradiated silicon pixel
detectors. We show that it is possible to adequately describe the
charge collection characteristics of a heavily irradiated silicon
detector in terms of a tuned double junction model which
produces a doubly-peaked electric ﬁeld across the detector. The
allowed parameter space of the model can also accommodate
the expected level of leakage current and the level of charge
trapping observed in the detector.

This paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the
experimental technique and data, Section III describes the car-
rier transport simulation used to interpret the data, Section IV
describes the technique used to model doubly-peaked electric
ﬁelds and the limitations of previous models. The tuning of
a successful model is discussed in Section V. Section VI
summarizes the results and develops several conclusions.

II. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE AND DATA

This investigation is based upon beam test data that were
accumulated as part of a program to develop a silicon pixel
tracking detector [7] for the CMS experiment at the CERN
Large Hadron Collider. The measurements were performed
in the H2 line of the CERN SPS in 2003/04 using 150-225
GeV pions. The beam test apparatus is described in [9] and
is shown in Fig. 1. A silicon beam telescope [8] consisted of
four modules each containing two 300 µm thick single-sided
silicon detectors with a strip pitch of 25 µm and readout pitch
of 50 µm. The two detectors in each module were oriented to
measure horizontal and vertical impact coordinates. A pixel
hybrid detector was mounted between the second and third
telescope modules on a cooled rotating stage. A trigger signal
was generated by a silicon PIN diode. The analog signals from
all detectors were digitized in a VME-based readout system

by two CAEN (V550) and one custom built FADCs. The
entire assembly was located in an open-geometry 3T Helmholtz
magnet that produced a magnetic ﬁeld parallel or orthogonal to
the beam. The temperature of the test sensors was controlled
with a Peltier cooler that was capable of operating down to
-30◦C. The telescope information was used to reconstruct the
trajectories of individual beam particles and to achieve a precise
determination of the particle hit position in the pixel detector.
The resulting intrinsic resolution of the beam telescope was
about 1 µm.

[11] which allow analog readout of all 704 pixel cells without
zero suppression. The PSI30 also has a linear response to input
signals ranging from from zero to more than 30,000 electrons.

B. Data

The main focus of the work presented in this paper involves
a set of charge collection measurements that were performed
using the “grazing angle technique” [12]. As is shown in Fig. 2,
the surface of the test sensor is oriented by a small angle
(15◦) with respect to the hadron beam. A large sample of
data is collected with zero magnetic ﬁeld and at a temperature
10◦C. The charge measured by each pixel along the y
of
direction samples a different depth z in the sensor. Precise entry
point information from the beam telescope is used to produce
ﬁnely binned charge collection proﬁles. For unirradiated sen-
sors, the cluster length determines the depth over which charge
is collected in the sensor.

A. Pixel Hybrids

The prototype pixel sensors are so-called “n-in-n” devices:
they are designed to collect charge from n+ structures im-
planted into n- bulk silicon. This design is thought to provide
greater longevity in high radiation ﬁelds and to allow “partially-
depleted” operation after “type-inversion” of the substrate. It
is more expensive than the ”p-in-n” process commonly used
in strip detectors because it requires double-sided processing
and the implementation of inter-pixel isolation. Two isolation
techniques were tested: p-spray, where a uniform medium dose
of p-impurities covers the whole structured surface, and p-
stop, where higher dose rings individually surround the n+
implants. Results on the Lorentz angle and charge collection
efﬁciency measurements as well as a detailed description of
both designs can be found elsewhere [9], [10]. In this paper we
discuss only measurements performed on p-spray sensors. All
125 µm2 pixels having
test devices were 22

1014 neq/cm2 are shown in Fig. 3. The unirradiated sensor
was operated at a bias voltage of 150V which is well above
its depletion voltage (approximately 70V). It produces a large
and uniform collected charge distribution indicating that it is
fully depleted (a large y coordinate indicates a large collection
distance). The irradiated sensor was operated at bias voltages
varying from 150V to 600V. It appears to be partly depleted at
150V, however, signal is collected across the entire thickness of
the detector. Another puzzle is that the ratio of charges collected
at 300V bias and 150V bias is 2.1 which is much larger than the
maximum value of √2 expected for a partly depleted junction.
It is clear that the proﬁles for the irradiated sensor exhibit rather
different behavior than one would expect for a heavily-doped,
unirradiated sensor.

III. SIMULATION AND COMPARISON WITH DATA

It is well-known that signal trapping is a signiﬁcant effect
in heavily irradiated silicon detectors. In order to evaluate the
effects of trapping, it is necessary to implement a detailed
simulation of the sensor. Our simulation, PIXELAV [13],
incorporates the following elements: an accurate model of
charge deposition by primary hadronic tracks (in particular
to model delta rays); a realistic electric ﬁeld map resulting
from the simultaneous solution of Poisson’s Equation, carrier
continuity equations, and various charge transport models; an

Hall Effect, and 3-D diffusion; a simulation of charge trapping
and the signal induced from trapped charge; and a simulation
of electronic noise, response, and threshold effects. A ﬁnal step
reformats the simulated data into test beam format so that it can
be processed by the test beam analysis software.

Several of the PIXELAV details described in [13] have
changed since they were published. The commercial semi-
conductor simulation code now used to generate a full three
dimensional electric ﬁeld map is the ISE TCAD package [14].
The charge transport simulation was modiﬁed to integrate only
the fully-saturated drift velocity,

where µ( ~E) is the mobility, q =
1 is the sign of the charge
carrier, ~E is the electric ﬁeld, ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld, and
rH is the Hall factor of the carrier. The use of the fully-
saturated drift velocity permits much larger integration steps
(which had previously been limited by stability considerations)
and signiﬁcantly increases the speed of the code.

The simulation was checked by comparing simulated data
with measured data from an unirradiated sensor. A plot of the
charge measured in a single pixel as a function of the horizontal
and vertical track impact position for normally incident tracks is
shown in Fig. 4. The simulation is shown as the solid histogram
and the test beam data are shown as solid points. Note that
the sensor simulation does not include the “punch-through”
structure on the n+ implants which is used to provide a high
resistance connection to ground and to provide the possibility of
on-wafer IV measurements. There is reduced charge collection
from this portion of the implant and the data shows reduced
signal in both projections at the bias dot. Another check, shown
in Table I, is the comparison of the average Lorentz angle
measured at several bias voltages [9]. In both cases, reasonable
agreement is observed between measured and simulated data.

proﬁles are shown as solid dots and the simulated proﬁles are
shown as histograms. The simulated proﬁles were generated
with electric ﬁeld maps corresponding to two different effective
densities of acceptor impurities. The full histograms are the
1012 cm−3. Note that the
simulated proﬁle for Neﬀ = 4.5
300V simulation reasonably agrees with the measured proﬁle
but the 150V simulation is far too broad. The dashed histograms

show the result of increasing Neﬀ to 24
effective doping density, the width of the simulated peak in the
150V distribution is close to correct but it does not reproduce
the “tail” observed in the data at large y. The 300V simulated
distribution is far too narrow and the predicted charge is lower
than the data (note that the proﬁles are absolutely normalized).
It is clear that a simulation based upon the standard picture
of a constant density of ionized acceptor impurities cannot
reproduce the measured proﬁles.

×

Note that the simulation of this irradiated sensor includes
the effects of trapping. The trapping rates of electron and
holes have been shown to scale linearly with ﬂuence [15],
[16]. Unfortunately, the measured ﬂuences have a fractional
uncertainty of
10% which feeds directly into the uncertainty
on the trapping rates. Additional uncertainty arises because
annealing can modify the trapping rates by 30% [15] leading
to a fairly large overall uncertainty.

IV. TWO-TRAP MODELS

The large number of measurements suggesting that large
electric ﬁelds exist at both sides of an irradiated silicon diode
has given rise to several attempts to model the effect [3], [6],
[17]. The most recent of these by Eremin, Verbitskaya, and Li

Within the EVL model, the four trapping cross sections are
set to 10−15 cm2. The leakage current is generated from an
additional SRH trapping state that is introduced for this purpose
but is assumed not to trap charge. The donor and acceptor states
are assumed not to generate leakage current which, given the
small size of the cross sections, is a self-consistent assumption.
The densities of the donor and acceptor states (ND and NA)
are adjusted to “ﬁt” TCT data. The parameters of the model
are given in Table II. The trap densities are scaled to ﬂuence
and are given in terms of introduction rates gint = NA/D/Φeq.

voltages of 150V and 300V are shown as solid dots. The full histograms are
the simulated proﬁles for a constant effective doping Neﬀ = 4.5×1012 cm−3
of acceptor impurities. The dashed histograms are the simulated proﬁles for a
constant effective doping Neﬀ = 24 × 1012 cm−3.

(EVL) [17] is based upon a modiﬁcation of the Shockley-Read-
Hall (SRH) statistics. The EVL model produces an effective
space charge density ρeﬀ from the trapping of leakage current
by one acceptor trap and one donor trap. The effective charge
density is related to the occupancies and densities of traps as
follows,

ρeﬀ = e [NDfD −

NAfA] + ρdopants

(2)

where: ND and NA are the densities of donor and acceptor trap-
ping states, respectively; fD and fA are the occupied fractions
of the donor and acceptor states, respectively, and ρdopants is
the charge density due to ionized dopants. Charge ﬂows to and
from the trapping states due to generation and recombination.
The occupied fractions are given by the following standard SRH
expressions,

from [17] and is shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6a shows a uniform
current density ﬂowing across a reverse-biased junction. Since
holes are produced uniformly across the junction and ﬂow to
the p+ backplane, the hole current density increases linearly
with increasing z from the n+ implant to the p+ implant.
The electrons ﬂow to the n+ implant and the electron current
density increases with decreasing z. The actual carrier densities
depend upon the details of the ﬁelds and mobilities but vary
monotonically across the junctions as shown in Fig. 6b. The
trapping of the mobile carriers produces a net positive space
charge density near the p+ backplane and a net negative space
charge density near the n+ implant as shown in Fig. 6c.
Since positive space charge corresponds to n-type doping and
negative space charge corresponds to p-type doping, there are
p-n junctions at both sides of the detector. The electric ﬁeld in
the sensor follows from a simultaneous solution of Poisson’s
equation and the carrier continuity equations. The resulting z-
component of the electric ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 6d. It varies
with an approximately quadratic dependence upon z having a
minimum at the zero of the space charge density and maxima
at both implants.

In order to test whether the electric ﬁeld predicted by
the EVL model would improve the agreement between the
simulated and measured charge collection proﬁles shown in
Section III, it was necessary to implement the EVL model
in ISE TCAD. TCAD contains a complete implementation of
SRH statistics. However, the EVL modiﬁcations of SRH are
not incorporated. In particular, any state added to generate
leakage current would also trap charge. It is possible to use the
TCAD “Physical Model” interface to replace the existing SRH
implementation with a modiﬁed one, however, a less invasive
approach was adopted.

Our approach is based upon three observations:

1) The trapping cross sections are poorly known. The cross
sections for states observed in various types of defect
spectroscopy vary over several orders of magnitude.
2) The occupancies fD/A of the trapping states are inde-
pendent of the scale of the cross sections. If the capture
cross sections σe/h in Eq. 3 are rescaled by a factor r,
then fD/A are unchanged. The occupancies depend only
upon the ratio of electron and hole cross sections, σh/σe.
3) The current U generated by the donor and acceptor
impurities is linear in the cross section rescaling factor
r.

e = σD

h = σA

These observations imply that it is possible to implement the
EVL model in TCAD simply by setting σD
e = σA
h
and by varying the size of the common cross section until the
generation current is equal to the observed or expected leakage
current. The trap occupancies are not affected in zeroth order
by the rescaling, but the leakage current and the free carrier
densities are affected by r. The carrier densities have a ﬁrst-
order effect on the occupancies so that varying r does alter ρeﬀ.
This approach uses the same trapping states to produce space
charge and leakage current (it is not necessary to introduce
current-generating states).

Using the activation energies and introduction rates for the
donor and acceptor states given in Table II, the only free
parameter in the TCAD implementation of the EVL model
is the size of the common cross section or equivalently, the
leakage current. The leakage current in the test sensors was
observed to increase substantially after bump-bonding to the
readout chips. Although the cause of the increased current is
not clear, it is possible that it is due to increased surface/edge
leakage or that it is caused by stressing the detector. The
measured leakage current, expressed in terms of the damage
parameter α [18], is listed in Table III. It is well established that
in large detectors, the magnitude of leakage current is expected
10−17 A/cm for a fully biased detector [18].

the leakage current adjusted to 20% of the measured value
which is comparable to the expected leakage current (α0). It
clearly substantially underestimates the collected charge at both
voltages. The effect of increasing the leakage current to 60%
of the measured value is shown as the dashed histogram. This
improves the agreement at 300V but produces too much signal
in the high z tail of the 150V distribution. Finally, in an attempt
to increase the collected charge at 300V, the introduction rates
were scaled down by a factor of eight. The common cross
section was increased by the same factor to hold the leakage
current constant. The result of this is shown as the solid
histogram in Fig. 7. Note that this does increase the collected
charge signal, however, it is still below the data at 300V and is
much too large in the tail region of the 150V distribution. We
conclude that the EVL model does not provide a quantitative
description of the measured charge collection proﬁles.

Fig. 7. The measured charge collection proﬁles for a sensor irradiated to a
ﬂuence of Φ = 8 × 1014 neq/cm2 (solid dots) and operated at 150V and
300V are compared with simulations based upon the EVL model. The dotted
histogram shows the EVL model with the leakage current adjusted to 20% of
the measured value which is comparable to the expected leakage current (α0).
The dashed histogram shows the effect of increasing the leakage current to 60%
of the measured value. The solid histogram shows the result of decreasing the
introduction rates by a factor of eight and increasing the cross sections by the
same factor.

V. AN IMPROVED TWO-TRAP MODEL

Although it led to a poor quantitative description of the
measured charge collection proﬁles, the EVL model does have
the qualitative features needed to describe the data. At low

bias voltages, the combination of the quadratic minimum in
the electric ﬁeld and signal trapping can act like a “gate”
suppressing the collection of charge from the p+ side of the
detector. The measured proﬁle would then appear to be a narrow
peak on the n+ side of the detector. As the bias is increased,
the magnitude of the ﬁeld at the minimum would also increase
and effectively “lift the gate” which would allow much more
charge collection from the p+ side of the detector.

e , σD

In order to investigate whether a two-trap double junction
EVL-like model can describe the measured charge collection
proﬁles, a tuning procedure was adopted. Relaxing the EVL
requirement that all trapping cross sections are equal, the model
has six free parameters (ND, NA, σD
h ) that
can be adjusted. The activation energies are kept ﬁxed to the
EVL values. Additionally, as was discussed in Section III,
the electron and hole signal trapping rates, Γe and Γh, are
uncertain at
the 30% level due to the ﬂuence uncertainty
and possible annealing of the sensors. They are treated as
constrained parameters. The parameters of the double junction
model were systematically varied and the agreement between
measured and simulated charge collection proﬁles was judged
subjectively.

h , σA

e , σA

In the course of the tuning procedure, it became clear that
the EVL model does not produce a sufﬁciently large electric
ﬁeld on the p+ side of the detector. The solution to this
problem is to increase the density of donors (hole traps) as
compared to the density of acceptors (electron traps). When
this is done, the z position of the minimum in the effective
charge density shifts toward the n+ implant as sketched in
Fig. 8a. Unfortunately, this causes the “peak” in the 150V
simulated charge proﬁle to become too narrow. The position of
the charge density minimum can be restored to a position nearer
the midplane of the detector by decreasing the ratios of the hole
and electron cross sections from 1.0 to 0.25 (σD
e = 0.25
and σA
e = 0.25) as shown schematically in Fig. 8b. Note
that the adjustment of the cross sections for both trap types
minimizes the ﬁeld in the quadratic minimum while allowing
for large ﬁelds at the implants. For simplicity it is assumed that
the electron cross sections are equal (σD
e = σe) and that
the hole cross sections are equal (σD

e = σA

The current best “ﬁt” to the measured charge collection
proﬁles is called model dj44 and reduces the ratio between
the densities of acceptor and donor states, NA/ND, from the
EVL value of 0.62 to 0.40. The z-component of the simulated

electric ﬁeld, Ez, is plotted as a function of z in Fig. 9 for bias
voltages of 150V and 300V. The ﬁeld proﬁles have minima
near the midplane of the detector. Note that the minimum ﬁeld
at 150V bias appears to be very small but is still approximately
400 V/cm. The electric ﬁeld proﬁles resulting from a constant
1012 cm−3 are shown
p-type doping of density Neﬀ = 4.5
as dot-dashed and dotted curves for reference.

dj44 is plotted as a function of z. The ﬁeld proﬁles for 150V and 300V are
shown as as solid and dashed curves, respectively. The electric ﬁeld proﬁles
resulting from a constant p-type doping of density Neﬀ = 4.5 × 1012 cm−3
are shown as dot-dashed and dotted curves for 150V and 300V, respectively.

The measured charge collection proﬁles at bias voltages
between 150V and 450V are compared with the dj44 simulation
1014 neq/cm2. The electron
in Fig. 10 for a ﬂuence of 6
×
trapping rate for the lower ﬂuence is set to 93% of the nominal
value.

Although for high values of the bias voltage the simulation
falls below the measured proﬁle, it provides a reasonable de-
scription of the measurements. Several features of the measured
distributions are described well by the simulation. Note that
both data and simulation show a distinctly negative signal
near y = 0 µm. This can be understood as a consequence
of hole trapping. Electrons deposited near the n+ implant are
collected with high efﬁciency whereas holes deposited near the
implant must transit the entire detector thickness to reach the p+
backplane. If the holes are collected, they produce no net signal
on the n+ side of the detector. However if the holes trap, then a
negative signal is induced and is most visible in the y < 0 µm
region. Another feature is the “wiggle” in the 150V proﬁles.
The relative signal minimum near y = 700 µm corresponds to
the Ez minimum where both electrons and holes travel only
short distances before trapping. This small separation induces
only a small signal on the n+ side of the detector. At larger
values of y, Ez increases causing the electrons drift back into
the minimum where they are likely to trap. However, the holes
drift into the higher ﬁeld region near the p+ implant and are
more likely to be collected. The net induced signal on the n+
side of the detector therefore increases and creates the local
maximum seen near y = 900 µm.

The dj44 model ﬁxes the ratios NA/ND and the ratio

where it has been assumed that
the trap occupancies are
small. Because NA/ND is assumed to be constant, contours
of constant electron trapping rate are parallel to contours of
constant leakage current in ND-σe space. The best “ﬁt” of
the simulation to the measured proﬁles reduced Γe to 93%
of the un-annealed trapping rate Γ0 for the nominal ﬂuence
[15]. These contours are compared with the allowed contour in
Fig. 11b. It is clear that the simulation can accommodate the
measured trapping rate in the same region of parameter space
that maximizes the leakage current.

Figure 11b also suggests a solution to the puzzle that the trap-
ping rates have been shown to be unaffected by the presence of
oxygen in the detector bulk [15] whereas it is well-established
that the space charge effects are quite sensitive to the presence
of oxygen in the material [19]. It is clear from Fig 11b that
small-cross-section trapping states can play a large role in the
effective charge density but a small one in the effective trapping
rates: every point on the dj44 line produces 100% of the
effective charge density but only the larger cross section points
contribute substantially to the trapping rate. If the formation
of the additional small-cross-section states were suppressed by
oxygen, then ρeﬀ could be sensitive to oxygenation whereas
Γe/h would be insensitive to oxygenation. This is another
consequence of the observation that the occupancies fD/A of
the trapping states are independent of the scale of the cross
sections in the steady state (see Section IV). The trapping of
signal carriers is not a steady-state phenomenon and is sensitive
to the scale of the trapping cross sections.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The main result of the work presented in this paper is that a
doubly-peaked electric ﬁeld is necessary to describe the charge
collection proﬁles measured in heavily irradiated pixel sensors.
A simulation utilizing a linearly varying electric ﬁeld based
upon the standard picture of a constant type-inverted effective
charge density is inconsistent with the measurements.

A two-trap EVL-like model can be tuned to provide a
reasonable description of the measurements. It can also account
for the expected level of the leakage current (although not
the observed leakage current) and the observed electron signal
trapping rate. It is important to state that any two-trap model
is, at best, an “effective theory”. It is well-known that there
are many trapping states in heavily irradiated silicon that trap
charge. There may also be thermodynamically ionized defects
that contribute to the effective space charge density. Clearly a
two-trap model can describe the gross features of the physical
processes in our sensors but it may not be able to describe all
details. This also implies that the parameters of the two-trap
model presented in this paper are unlikely to have physical
reality.

The charge-sharing behavior and resolution functions of
many detectors are sensitive to the details of the internal
electric ﬁeld. A known response function is a key element of
any reconstruction procedure. A working effective model will
permit the detailed response of these detectors to be tracked as
they are irradiated in the next generation of accelerators.

Finally, we note that despite a growing body of contrary
evidence, the overly simple picture of uniform type inversion
in irradiated silicon detectors persists in the minds of many
researchers and even in the terminology used by experts to
describe their devices. After irradiation, quantities like ℓdep
(depletion depth) and Neﬀ may correctly suggest reduced detec-
tor performance but given the reality of doubly-peaked electric
ﬁelds and signal trapping, they have no physical signiﬁcance.

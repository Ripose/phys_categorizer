Introdution

We have simulated the performanes of a GEM with a large density of multipliation holes.

The elementary ell is an equilateral triangle whose side is 90µm. We shall assume that this

pattern extends in the (x,y) plane. At eah vertex of the equilateral triangle there is a GEM

hole with an external radius of 30µm and an internal radius of 20µm. The referene frame

used in this study has the origin of axis in the enter of the GEM hole with the z axis pointing

to the drift plane. The geometry of the GEM is shown in (cid:28)gure 1.

In this short note we will desribe the simulation of the GEM and, in partiular we will

study the gain and di(cid:27)usion of the harge for di(cid:27)erent gas mixtures. This study has been

performed to (cid:28)nalize the design of the PixiE Imager Detetor.

We have started the simulation by generating single eletrons in di(cid:27)erent positions in the

(x,y) plane at (cid:28)xed z-oordinate. This is the most elementary element through whih we an

simulate traks and the imaging performane of the detetor. The proess has been followed

through multipliation in the large (cid:28)elds of the GEM and di(cid:27)usion of produed eletrons

reahing the readout plane. Due to the ylindrial symmetry of the GEM the (cid:28)rst quadrant

(x > 0, y > 0, see (cid:28)gure 1) has been seleted to produe the oordinate (r ,φ) of the starting
eletrons at the quota of 40 µm (approximately 15 µm over the top GEM):

Gain Study

We have de(cid:28)ned as absolute gain the number of eletrons whih reah the quota z = −40µm
(below the plane the GEM, approximately 15µm below the bottom GEM plane). At this

quota most of the multipliation proesses at the GEM hole are done.

However not all these eletrons drift to the readout plane, some reombine and many stik

to the lower GEM plane (re-attahment). For this reason we have de(cid:28)ned also an e(cid:27)etive

gain as the number of eletrons whih arrive at the quota z = −200µm. The eletrons

reahing this quota are onsidered to be olleted by the read out plane.

It's ustomary to desribe the gain with a Polya:

Where b is an adjustable parameter and n is the average gain. We have used this formula

and (cid:28)t the data with the funtion:

−n/b·n

· e

F (n; p0, p1, p2) = p2 · np0−1 · e

−n/p1

where p2 is a normalization fator and the gain is the Polya mean, G = p0 · p1 .

The gain distribution is di(cid:27)erent for di(cid:27)erent mixtures of gases. In partiular the absolute

gain distribution is often wide with long tails and a desription with a single Polya is not

always satisfatory. Hene, we have desribed the distribution with the sum of two Polya,

2

of whih the (cid:28)rst one (cid:28)ts most of events and the seond one aounts for the long tails. An

example is shown in (cid:28)gure 2. We have taken as the average gain of the GEM the mean of the

(cid:28)rst Polya.

Sometimes the distribution shows two lear maxima and a two Polya (cid:28)t is satisfatory. In

this ase the mean of the two Polya is the average gain of the GEM under analysis. Results

Figure 4: Left: gas mixtures of 20%Ar-80%DME and 50%Ar-50%DME. The plots show the depen-

dene of the e(cid:27)etive gain on the GEM voltage. The olletion (cid:28)eld is 4KV /cm. Right: gas mixture

80%Ar-20%DME with a large prodution of seondary avalanhes. The (cid:28)gure shows the mean of

e(cid:27)etive gain as a funtion of the GEM voltage and for a olletion (cid:28)eld of 4KV /cm. The values of

gain are the mean of (cid:28)rst (gain low) and seond (gain hight) Polya whih (cid:28)t the two peaks observed

in the gain distribution.

Firstly to establish if the GEM keeps

memory of the starting point of the ele-

trons, both in azimuth and radius (with re-

spet to the enter of the hole where the

avalanhe ours) with a better resolution

than the granularity of GEM's hole.

For this, we have studied the position

of the baryentre of harge arrived on read-

out plane (baryentre of the avalanhe) as

a funtion of the position of the starting

point.

The seond point is the RMS of Gaus-

sian distribution of harge in the olletion

gap whih is related with the spatial reso-

lution of the detetor.

We have onsidered

∆R = Rf in − Rin
where Rin = r and Rf in is the radius of the average harge at the quota z = −200µm.
First of all we have studied the dependene of ∆R on Rin

The (cid:28)gure 5 shows an example of suh a dependene. ∆R is a linear funtion of Rin and
a parameterization: ∆R = P2Rin + P1 with P2 ≈ −1 and P1 ≈ 20µm is a good (cid:28)t for
all simulations ((cid:28)gure 6). For a ideal GEM ∆R = 0 in fat this means that the position (in

radius) of the multiplied harge is the same as the initial eletron (the GEM does not disturb

the image). The results of the (cid:28)t shows instead that the average olleted harge position

is independent of the starting position (P2 ≈ −1) and that the multipliation ours at the
radius r ≈ 20 − 30µm (the lower external radius).

Figure 6: The values of p1 (µm) and p2 in funtion of perentage of Argon and Neon.

The last step is the study of the dispersion of the avalanhe's harge after it drifted to the

olletion eletrodes.

We have averaged the RMS of the events produed at eah point and veri(cid:28)ed that its value

is independent of the position of primary eletron. Hene we have averaged the RMS of all

events at all points, to improve the statistis and studied its dependene on the GEM voltage.

Sine, again, we have found no dependene, we have average on all events for a de(cid:28)ned gas

omposition.

The results for 100%CO2 gas at 0.5 atm are:
• RM Sp = 12.5 µm

• RM Ssp = 17.67 µm

The results for Argon and Neon mixtures are shown in (cid:28)gure 7, the RMS dereases mildly

with inreasing perentage of Argon and Neon.

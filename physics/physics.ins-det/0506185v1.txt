Spatial Resolution Studies with a GEM-TPC in High Magnetic Fields

Peter Wienemann
DESY, Notkestr. 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany

A large volume Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has been proposed as main tracking device at the International
Linear Collider (ILC). Gas electron multipliers (GEMs) are studied as potential replacement of the conventional wire
based gas ampliﬁcation system of TPCs. This talk presents recent results from R&D activities with a small GEM-TPC
prototype. The spatial resolution was measured for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds up to 4 T.

1. INTRODUCTION

The ambitious physics program at the International Linear Collider (ILC) poses stringent requirements on the
performance of the detector. An accurate momentum measurement and a good particle identiﬁcation relies crucially
on precise tracking information. Therefore the development of the tracker needs special attention. As main tracker
for a detector at the ILC, a large Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is being studied. It allows the instrumentation
of a large volume with many voxels and represents only a minimum amount of material before the calorimeters.
Moreover it has good particle identiﬁcation capabilities, a genuine three-dimensional track reconstruction without
ambiguities, and concentrates its sensitive parts to the endplates, allowing easy maintainability. Contrary to previous
TPCs with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs) for gas ampliﬁcation, future TPCs are likely to make use of
Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGDs). One promising MPGD candidate is the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [1].
Among its advantages are ampliﬁcation structures of order 100 µm giving rise to only tiny ~E
~B eﬀects, a fast and
narrow electron signal and intrinsic ion backdrift suppression.

2. THE DESY TPC PROTOTYPE

In order to investigate the potential of TPCs with GEM ampliﬁcation, a small prototype has been built at DESY.
The chamber has a maximal drift length of 800 mm and a diameter of 270 mm. Its size has been chosen such that
it ﬁts into a superconducting 5 T magnet available for detector R&D studies at DESY. The chamber endplate is
6.2 mm2. Two diﬀerent pad layouts are investigated: First
equipped with 24
a layout where the pads in each row are shifted by half a pitch with respect to the pads in the two neighboring rows
(staggered) and a second setup with aligned pads (non-staggered). The maximal drift length amounts to 670 mm.
Gas ampliﬁcation is provided by a triple GEM structure with two 2 mm transfer gaps and a 3 mm induction gap.
The readout electronics is based on modules developed for the ALEPH experiment at LEP.

3. MEASUREMENTS IN HIGH MAGNETIC FIELDS

One of the most important quantities of a TPC is the achievable spatial resolution. It depends on various chamber
parameters such as the diﬀusion of the chosen gas, the pad size, the electronics, the gas ampliﬁcation settings, etc.
Since the transverse diﬀusion coeﬃcient of gases strongly depends on the magnetic ﬁeld, it is necessary to perform
spatial resolution measurements in magnetic ﬁelds in order to get reliable estimates of the performance of the ﬁnal
detector. A good quantity to compare spatial resolutions of diﬀerent small prototypes and to extrapolate to a
large-scale device is the single point resolution.

(95-5) at 4 T (right).

To ﬁnd out what single point resolution might be feasible, a series of measurements was carried out with cosmic
muons at various magnetic ﬁelds up to 4 T, the value proposed in the technical design report for TESLA [2]. These
runs were performed for two diﬀerent gases, namely Ar-CH4-CO2 (93-5-2) and Ar-CH4 (95-5).

3.1. Analysis Technique

The reconstruction of tracks is done in three steps. First three-dimensional space points are reconstructed from
the pulses in each row. In a second step, these space points are combined to tracks using a three-dimensional track
following algorithm. Finally the track parameters are ﬁtted using a maximum likelihood ﬁt which takes the pad
response function into account [3]. To determine the spatial resolution, the following procedure is applied: One
row is chosen and the horizontal track position is re-ﬁtted using only data from that row keeping all other track
parameters (inclination, width and curvature) ﬁxed to the values obtained from a ﬁt to all pad rows. The distribution
of the diﬀerence of this re-ﬁtted horizontal position and the original horizontal position is stored. Subsequently the
same method is repeated with the only modiﬁcation that the ﬁxed parameters are set to the values obtained from
a track ﬁt excluding the information from the chosen row. This is done for all rows. A good estimate of the spatial
resolution is obtained by calculating the geometric mean of the widths of the two distributions determined in the
described way.

3.2. Diffusion Coefﬁcient

As mentioned above, diﬀusion is an important factor inﬂuencing the spatial resolution of a TPC. It leads to a
spread of the primary charge cloud due to collisions with gas atoms/molecules. Therefore the width σ of the charge
cloud on the pads increases with increasing drift distance z:

D is the diﬀusion constant and σ0 the defocussing term describing the charge widening in the ampliﬁcation system.
D varies with the magnetic ﬁeld according to the formula

σ2 = D2z + σ2

and the values from a Garﬁeld simulation are shown.

where ω = eB/m is the cyclotron frequency and τ the mean time between collisions.

Figure 1 shows the square of the ﬁtted charge cloud width versus the drift length for two examples, Ar-CH4-CO2
(93-5-2) at 1 T and for Ar-CH4 (95-5) at 4 T. The data is well described by Equation 1. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient
and the defocussing terms are obtained from a linear ﬁt to the data. The results are shown in the plots. Such
measurements are accomplished for various magnetic ﬁelds for both gases. The outcome is shown in Figure 2 where
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient is plotted versus the magnetic ﬁeld. In addition to the measurements, results from a Garﬁeld
simulation [4] are included. The diﬀusion coeﬃcient drops in accordance with Equation 2 with the magnetic ﬁeld.
Qualitative agreement is achieved between measurement and simulation, although quantitatively the simulation
seems to provide systematically slightly higher values than the measurement. This phenomenon has been observed
by various groups [5].

3.3. Spatial Resolution

Using the procedure described in Section 3.1, the transverse single point resolution is determined for various
magnetic ﬁelds. Figure 3 shows the results for Ar-CH4 (95-5) as a function of the drift length for 1 T, 2 T and 4 T. Due
to diﬀusion the spatial resolution gets worse for increasing drift length. This eﬀect is signiﬁcantly suppressed for high
6.2 mm2 pads, the current preliminary analysis
magnetic ﬁelds because of the reduced diﬀusion coeﬃcient. For 2.2
yields about 120 µm transverse resolution for Ar-CH4 (95-5) at 4 T. This is in full agreement with the requirements
listed in [2]. Nevertheless further studies are under way to gain a deeper understanding of the systematics involved
in the reconstruction method.

A small TPC prototype with GEM foils for gas ampliﬁcation has been successfully built to measure the spatial
6.2 mm2
resolution in high magnetic ﬁelds. Cosmic muon runs were carried out in B ﬁelds up to 4 T. For 2.2
pads, the present preliminary analysis yields about 120 µm transverse resolution with Ar-CH4 (95-5) at 4 T, in full
agreement with the TESLA TDR requirements. These are encouraging results revealing the potential of GEMs as
TPC gas ampliﬁcation system.

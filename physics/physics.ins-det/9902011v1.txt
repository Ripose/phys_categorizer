Abstract

Compton backscattering polarimetry provides a fast and accurate method to mea-
sure the polarization of an electron beam in a storage ring. Since the method is
non-destructive, the polarization of the electron beam can be monitored during
internal target experiments. For this reason, a Compton polarimeter has been con-
structed at NIKHEF to measure the polarization of the longitudinally polarized
electrons which can be stored in the AmPS ring. The design and results of the
polarimeter, the ﬁrst Compton polarimeter to measure the polarization of a stored
longitudinally polarized electron beam directly, are presented in this paper.

1 Introduction

Stored polarized electron beams are now available at many laboratories. Such
beams are produced either by radiative polarization[1,2] of the stored beam or
by injecting polarized electrons. Internal target experiments performed with

such a beam require the electron polarization to be measured during the ex-
periments. These measurements need to be done quickly, so that any changes
in polarization can be accounted for, and parasitically, so that the measure-
ment in no way aﬀects the internal target experiment. One technique to do
this is through the use of a Compton backscattering polarimeter.

In this technique, a circularly polarized photon beam is scattered oﬀ a polar-
ized electron beam. Due to the asymmetry in the spin-dependent Compton
scattering cross section, the polarization of the electron beam can be deter-
mined by changing the helicity of the photon beam. For transversely polarized
electrons the asymmetry is measured with respect to the orbital plane of the
electrons, while for longitudinally polarized electrons the asymmetry is mea-
sured in the energy-dependent cross section.

To perform spin-dependent electron scattering experiments, the MEA/AmPS
facility at NIKHEF has been upgraded to provide a longitudinally polarized
electron beam for internal target experiments[3]. An overview of the NIKHEF
electron beam facility is shown in ﬁg. 1. Polarized electrons are produced by
a recently commissioned Polarized Electron Source (PES) [3], consisting of a
laser driven photocathode electron source, a Z-shaped spin manipulator to ori-
ent the electron spin in any arbitrary direction, a Mott polarimeter to measure
the electron polarization at the source, and a post-accelerator to match the
energy of the polarized electrons to the acceptance of the chopper/buncher sys-
tem of the linac(400 keV). After the post-accelerator, the polarized electrons
are injected into the linear medium-energy accelerator (MEA) and accelerated
up to 750 MeV. The electrons are then injected into the AmPS storage ring.
Due to the low current produced by the polarized source, only a few mA can
be stored per injection, but through the use of stacking a current of more than
200 mA has been stored in the ring. A Siberian Snake [4,5] has been installed
in the ring to preserve the polarization of the stored beam and to maintain a
longitudinal orientation of the spin at the location of the internal target[6].

In this paper the performance of a laser backscattering polarimeter is pre-
sented, which was designed and constructed for the measurement of the lon-
gitudinal polarization of the stored electron beam in the AmPS ring. While
many laboratories use Compton backscattering polarimeters to measure the
polarization of stored transversely polarized electron beams[1,7,8], the present
polarimeter was the ﬁrst to measure the longitudinal polarization of a stored
polarized electron beam[9].

In section 2, the physics of Compton scattering is discussed with emphasis on
the energy range of the AmPS ring and on the technique for the measurement
of longitudinal polarization. In section 3 the layout and the technical charac-
teristics of the polarimeter are described, and in section 4 the results of the
performance tests of the polarimeter are presented. Emphasis is put on the

2 The Physics of Compton Scattering

The kinematics of Compton scattering in the lab frame is shown in ﬁg. 2. The

while the scattered photon energy is expressed as Eγ. The scattered electron
is not shown. The positive z-axis is deﬁned to be the direction of the incident
electron. Unlike the kinematics of transversely polarized electrons, the reac-
tion with longitudinally polarized electrons is symmetric about the azimuthal
angle ϕ, and thus only the angle θ, between the incident electron and scattered

tered in a narrow cone centered around the direction of the initial electron.
Typical values of the scattering angle in the lab frame, corresponding to 90◦
scattering in the electron rest frame, are given in table 1.

The polarization of the electron is speciﬁed in Cartesian coordinates by
P = Pe ˆP = (Px, Py, Pz) and that of the incident photon by the Stokes vec-
tor S = (S0, S1, S2, S3) [10]. The amount of linearly polarized light is given by
qS2
2 and that of circular polarization by |S3|. The sign of S3 indicates the
helicity of the polarization: S3 > 0 for left-handed helicity (S3L) and S3 < 0
for right-handed helicity (S3R). For normalization of the Stokes vector S0 is
taken to be unity.

This cross section and the spin correlation function are shown in ﬁg. 3. Exact
formula’s for these quantities can be found e.g. in refs. [11–14].

switching the sign of S3 which gives an asymmetry proportional with Pz.

The longitudinal polarization of the electron beam, Pz, can be determined by
taking the quantity Pz as a free parameter while ﬁtting the measured asym-
metry with eq. 2. The photon polarization term, ∆S3, needs to be measured
independently.

Typical values of the total unpolarized Compton cross section, the maximum
energy for backscattered photons, and the maximum value for the spin cor-
relation function are given in table 1 for various electron beam energies that
can be stored in the AmPS ring.

3 The NIKHEF Compton Polarimeter

A schematic layout of the Compton polarimeter is shown in ﬁg. 4. The po-
larimeter consists of the laser system with its associated optical system and a
detector for the detection of the backscattered photons[15]. Laser photons in-
teract with stored electrons in the straight section (∼ 3 m long) after the ﬁrst
dipole (bending angle 11.25◦) and before the second dipole after the Internal

where ϕe is the bending angle of the electrons and ϕp the precession angle
of the spin. The polarimeter is only sensitive to the longitudinal component
of the electron spin (see eq. 2). Therefore, the experimental asymmetry of
the polarimeter reduces with cos(ϕp). To minimize this reduction factor, the
polarimeter has to be located close to the ITF. If for example the North or
South straight (see ﬁg. 1) would be used for the polarimeter (90◦ rotation
from the ITF), the spin would be exactly transverse at Ee = 440 MeV, and
the reduction factor would be zero. On the other hand, because of the internal
target at the ITF, the residual gas pressure in the 32 m long west straight can
be orders of magnitude higher than in any other place in the ring, resulting in
a large bremsstrahlung background. The section between the ﬁrst and second
dipole after the ITF has been chosen as a compromise between spin precession
and bremsstrahlung background.

The backscattered photons leave the IR travelling in the same direction as the
electrons of the beam and are separated from them by the second dipole. The
γ-photons leave the vacuum system via a vacuum window and pass through
a mirror of the optical system, a sweeping magnet, and a hole in a concrete
shielding wall to the gamma detector.

3.1 The laser and the associated optical system

An Innova 100-25 Ar-ion laser system 4 is used which can provide a 10 W
continuous beam. The wavelength of the laser light is λ = 514 nm, the diver-
gence 0.4 mrad (full angle), and the diameter 1.8 mm. The initially linearly
polarized light is converted to circularly polarized light with an anti-reﬂection
coated λ/4-plate. Left- and right-handed light is obtained by switching the
high voltage on a Inrad 214-090 Pockels cell 5 , positioned after the λ/4-plate,
see ﬁg. 4. The Pockels cell switches between zero-wave (if high voltage is oﬀ)
and half-wave (if high voltage is on) retardation. The polarization of the laser
light is better than 99.8% directly after the Pockels cell. We have observed
a small degradation along the beam path, but the degree of polarization is
well above 95% at the IR if the system is tuned carefully. After the ﬁrst tests
with a polarized electron beam (see section 4), we have added a λ/2-plate to
our system, which reverses the sign of the laser polarization while keeping all
steering signals and the high voltage on the Pockels cell constant. The λ/2-
plate can be moved into the optical path by means of a compressed air driven
translation stage and is located directly after the Pockels cell. It has been used
to investigate false asymmetries (see section 4).

To facilitate the transport of the laser beam and in order to prevent the Pockels
cell from damage by high intensity light, a Galilean expander consisting of two
lenses is placed in front of the λ/4-plate. The focal lengths of the lenses are
-2.5 cm and 8.0 cm with almost coinciding focal points. This results in an
expansion of the laser beam by a factor 3.2 and a reduction of the divergence
by the same factor. The focal point of the expander is placed in the IR. The
lenses are diﬀraction-limited and have anti-reﬂection coatings optimized for
514 nm.

In order to protect both the Ar-ion laser and the Pockels cell from radiation
damage they are installed in a niche in the NW-curve of AmPS. The laser light
is guided to the IR, over a total path of approximately 12 m, by a system of six
dielectric mirrors. All mirrors are optimized for 90◦ scattering at 514 nm. The
ﬁrst mirror reﬂects the beam from the niche in the direction of ITF. A set of
two mirrors reﬂects the beam into the beam positioning system. Two mirrors

are used at this location in order to account for the 11.25◦ bend caused by the
ﬁrst dipole after ITF, while maintaining 90◦ reﬂections on all mirrors.

The positioning system consists of two mirrors connected to two translation
stages and a gimbal mount. Both translation stages and the gimbal mount
can be controlled with DC-motors. The positioning system gives full control
over both angle and position of the laser beam in all directions and is used
to optimize the overlap of the electron and laser beam. Initial alignment was
done manually, centering it on the entrance and exit vacuum windows of the
IR. The ﬁnal alignment of the laser beam is performed with the DC-motors,
while electrons are circulating in AmPS. The laser is aligned by optimizing
the rate of backscattered photons, see ﬁg. 5. A sixth mirror is used to reﬂect
the beam into the IR.

The laser beam enters and leaves the IR via Kodial ND-40 CF-F vacuum
windows 6 (diameter 25 mm). A system of two mirrors reﬂects the beam into
a beam analysis system after the second vacuum window. It consists of a
power meter, a linear polarizer, and λ/2-plate. The polarizer and λ/2-plate
are mounted on a motorized translation stage and can be taken out of the
beam path to measure the total transported laser power. When the λ/2-plate
and polarizer have been inserted into the beam, the λ/2-plate can be rotated
with a DC-motor and the laser polarization can be determined by measuring
the power as a function of the orientation of the λ/2-plate. Laser beam po-

larization measurements done with the beam analysis system are only used
as a monitor of the system. The polarization used in the extraction of the
electron polarization from an asymmetry measurement is measured manually
immediately before and after the vacuum windows of the IR. This ensures
the absence of systematic errors introduced by the two mirrors between the
second vacuum window and the beam analysis system.

A chopper mounted immediately after the laser is used to block the laser light
for 1/3 of the time to measure the background. The chopper, operating at a
frequency of 75 Hz, is also used to generate the driving signal for the Pockels
cell. This ensures that the background measurement and the ﬂipping of the
laser polarization have exactly the same frequency.

The small fraction of the laser light transmitted through the mirrors is utilized
to monitor the position of the laser beam using camera’s which are located
directly before and after the IR.

3.2 The gamma detector

The gamma detector of the polarimeter, situated ∼12 m downstream of the
IR, must be capable of detecting γ-rays with an energy of up to 30 MeV
(see table 1), handling rates up to 1 MHz, and be radiation resistant. Total
absorption shower counters made of dense inorganic scintillating crystals were
chosen.

For the commissioning experiments with an unpolarized stored electron beam
a cylindrical BGO scintillator crystal (102 mm diameter and 100 mm long),
optically coupled to a Hamamatsu R1250 photomultiplier 7 was used to test
and tune our laser positioning system. A disadvantage of BGO crystal is the
long decay time (300 ns) of the scintillation light which limits the maximum
rate.

The BGO crystal was later replaced by a rectangular (24 × 10 × 10 cm3) pure
CsI crystal. This crystal was optically coupled to a XP4312/B photomulti-
plier 8 . Due to the small decay time of the pure CsI crystal (35 and 6 ns),
an active base on the photomultiplier tube, and dedicated electronics, the to-
tal setup is able to handle rates up to 1 MHz. A 10 cm thick lead cylinder
surrounds the scintillator crystal for shielding purposes. A plastic scintillator
(NE102) placed in the front of the gamma detector can be used to veto charged
particles.

3.3 The Control and the Data Acquisition System

The optical system is controlled with a computer code developed with Lab-
VIEW 9 on a SUN-workstation, see ﬁg. 6. The communication between the
workstation and the optical system is realised via GPIB (IEEE-488.2), which
is connected to the workstation via Ethernet. The four DC-motors used for
the steering of the laser beam are controlled by a PI804 motor controller 10 . A
resolution of 2 µm and 60 µrad can be obtained with the PI804 and the DC-
motors. Control signals for the movement of the λ/2-plate after the Pockels
cell, and of the λ/2-plate and translation stage of the beam analysis system
are also generated in the PI804.

The data acquisition is done with a single VME-module, designed and con-
structed at NIKHEF. The module accepts the analog output of the photo-
multiplier connected to the gamma detector and digitises this signal using an
8-bit ﬂash ADC. Furthermore, it accepts logic signals representing the state
of the chopper and the Pockels cell. Based on those signals, the module con-
structs four separate energy spectra, for laser blocked or not and for left and

l
right circularly polarized light. The maximum rate the module can handle is
2.5 MHz. The energy spectra are read out typically every 30 s. The VME-
module can generate its own trigger for the ADC or it can accept an external
trigger. When the external trigger is used, more sophisticated triggering sys-
tems can be made, while the internal trigger makes any external logic modules
superﬂuous, resulting in a very compact system. An extra advantage of the
external trigger circuit is the possibility to connect the trigger not only to the
VME-module, but also to a scaler. The scaler information can then be used
for the optimization of the electron and laser beam overlap and to determine
dead-time corrections for all energy spectra. Both modes of operation have
been used.

Determining the electron polarization from the energy spectra is done via
eq. 2. All energy spectra are normalized to their integrated luminosities, taking
into account dead-time eﬀects and measuring times. Background spectra are
subtracted, after which the experimental asymmetry (Aexp) is constructed,
via:

Aexp(Eγ) =

= ∆S3Pe cos ϕpαexp
3z

(5)

nL − nR
nL + nR

where nL (nR) are the energy spectra for left (right) polarized laser light, after
normalisation and background subtraction. The experimental spin correlation
function αexp
is obtained with Monte Carlo simulations, performed with the
3z
computer code GEANT[17], taking into account the electron and laser beam
phase space along the IR and the characteristics of the gamma detector. ∆S3
is measured separately and cos ϕp is calculated from the electron beam energy.
Pe is extracted from Aexp via a ﬁt with eq. 5 with Pe as a free parameter. The
results of the Monte Carlo simulations have also been used for the energy
calibration of the gamma detector.

4 The performance of the polarimeter

The polarimeter has been tested with polarized electrons at a low beam current
of appr. 5 mA. These preliminary tests were the ﬁrst direct measurements
of longitudinal polarization in an electron storage ring. They are described
in section 4.1. The accuracy of the electron polarization enters directly in
the accuracy of all experiments performed with the polarized electron beam.
Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that the statistical and systematic
uncertainty in Pe is small and well known. Statistical accuracy of 1% can
be obtained in 1500 s and will not inﬂuence the accuracy of the internal
target experiments signiﬁcantly. We have performed extensive investigations
of the systematic uncertainty of the polarimeter, in order to minimize and

section 4.2. Finally, the polarimeter has been used to monitor the electron
polarization during the ﬁrst internal target experiment at NIKHEF that made
use of the polarized beam. This is presented in the last paragraph of this
section.

4.1 Preliminary tests

Preliminary tests with a polarized electron beam have been done with a beam
current of 2–5 mA and 3 W laser power, to avoid rate problems in the gamma-
detector and to minimize the contribution of background events. Because of
the extremely low current in the accelerator and a very poor injection eﬃ-
ciency, multiple injections were stacked to obtain the beam current mentioned.
The electron energy was 615 MeV, resulting in backscattered photons with a
maximum energy of Emax
= 13.7 MeV. 88% of all detected photons origi-
nated from Compton scattering, with a rate normalized to the beam current
of 3.5 kHz/mA, see ﬁg. 7.

reducing the polarization in AmPS to 0.39 11 .

During the experiment, an energy shift was observed between the energy spec-
tra for left- and right-handed polarized laser light, due to ground currents (see
next section). This shift of 22 keV (≈ 10−3 of the full scale) was corrected. The
asymmetry Aexp was measured and the electron polarization Pe extracted, see
ﬁg. 8. In the extraction of the electron polarization, we only used the values
of Aexp measured in the energy range from 5 to 14 MeV. The lower limit of
the range is determined by the energy threshold of the detector. As the energy
shift described above occurs before the trigger is applied, the asymmetry gets
a systematic oﬀset at the threshold (see the lowest points in ﬁg. 8). The upper
limit is chosen such that the real to background ratio is better than 4:1, to
avoid sensitivity to the background subtraction.

We measured Pe = 0.38 ± 0.04 (Pe = −0.42 ± 0.06) for electrons with positive
(negative) helicity. These numbers are in good agreement with the result from
the Mott polarimeter. We also determined Aexp for unpolarized electrons and
found Pe = 0.01 ± 0.04%, indicating the absence of false asymmetries in our
measurements. This ﬁrst result obtained with the Compton polarimeter proves
that it is possible to accelerate polarized electrons and inject them in a storage
ring, even if stacking is required. It also shows that it is possible to operate
a Compton polarimeter to determine the absolute degree of polarization of a

4.2 Systematic checks

We have performed a series of measurements to investigate the systematic
errors of the polarimeter. False asymmetries result in errors on the determi-
nation of the electron polarization. Possible sources of false asymmetries are:
a) inaccuracies in the ratio of the integrated luminosities for the two laser
polarization states; b) inaccuracies in the determination of the background
contribution, and; c) any signal in phase with the asymmetry measurement.
The ﬁrst type of false asymmetry will give a energy-independent contribution,
while type b will depend on Eγ. Type c can either be energy dependent or
independent, based on how the signal inﬂuences the asymmetry measurement.

During these measurements, the storage ring could only be operated with a
10% partial snake[19]. Therefore, it was necessary to perform all measurements
at an electron beam energy of 440 MeV, resulting in a maximum energy for
the Compton photons of 7.0 MeV. This beam energy is lower than the design
speciﬁcation of the polarimeter (500–900 MeV), resulting in a poor energy
resolution. To reduce background at this rather low energy, we performed all
measurements with beam currents smaller than 15 mA, resulting in Compton
rates ≤ 120 kHz (8.0 kHz/mA). An advantage of the low beam energy for
our measurements is an enhanced sensitivity for false asymmetries, because of
the relatively small Compton asymmetry (see table 2). The polarization mea-
sured with the Mott polarimeter was 0.69. The settings of the Z-shaped spin
manipulator were optimized for maximum polarization in the AmPS ring[20].

The measurements showed an energy-independent asymmetry of the order of

14

0.5 · 10−3. It disappeared if we disabled the switching of the Pockels cell. After
we switched the Pockels cell the rate changed of the order of 10% in 10 s, and
then stabilized. If we moved the laser beam by 0.1 mm simultaneously with
the switching of the Pockels cell, the equilibrium rate was the same for both
states. From this, we concluded that the Pockels cell is heated by applying
the high voltage. The eﬀect is a small steering of the laser beam, in the order
of 10 µrad between the two equilibrium states, or 15 nrad during normal
operation, resulting in a false asymmetry of type a. The exact value of this
false asymmetry changed over the time of days, though the order of magnitude
was constant. It can be explained by temperature drifts of the laser, because
the size of the false asymmetry depends strongly on the exact position of the
laser beam with respect to the electron beam.

False asymmetries from inaccuracies in the background contributions are neg-
ligible, because of the good real to background ratio in the energy range used
for the polarization measurements. Furthermore, the background has to be
related to the laser polarization in order to introduce false asymmetries. In
the energy range used, no physics process can contribute signiﬁcantly to the
asymmetry. The background subtraction could also introduce an error in the
size of the asymmetry, if the background subtraction was not performed ac-
curately. Also this eﬀect is negligible, because we measured the background
simultaneously, the background is small compared to the real signal, and we
correct all energy spectra for dead-time eﬀects.

The only signal in phase with the asymmetry measurements is the driving
signal of the Pockels cell and electronics. We have observed a false asymmetry
of the order of 2 · 10−3, related to the driving signal of the Pockels cell and
electronics. It is proportional to the derivative of the energy spectrum. This
indicates that the signal from the gamma detector is shifted by the driving
signal of the Pockels cell, before digitisation. This can happen either between
the detector and the electronics, or inside the VME-module. The asymmetry
disappears if we generate the driving signals for the electronics separately, in-
dicating that the shift of the analog signal happens before the signal reaches
the electronics. This is conﬁrmed by the fact that the false asymmetry also
disappears if the signal from the gamma detector is disconnected from the elec-
tronics. The shift of the analog signal results in a shift of the energy spectrum
of the order of 1 · 10−3 of the full energy scale.

Both false asymmetries mentioned above can be corrected for, if they are
known during real polarization measurements. Therefore, we have performed
all measurements in sets of six. Three measurements were done with diﬀer-
ent electron polarizations injected into the ring (positive helicity, unpolarized
and negative helicity). These measurements were repeated with the λ/2-plate
inserted in the path of the laser beam, which reverses the sign of the mea-
sured Compton asymmetry by a change of sign of the laser polarization. The

measurements with unpolarized electrons were used to determine the false
asymmetries. This is only valid, if the false asymmetries do not change on the
time scale of the 2 times 3 measurements. To check this, one measurement
of such a set was repeated nine times. To exclude sensitivity to variations in
the polarization of the injected electrons or spin life time, we choose to use
unpolarized electrons. The total measurement time was appr. 90 minutes.,
while a full set of six measurements normally takes about 60 minutes. The re-
sults are shown in ﬁg. 9 and show good stability on this time scale, indicating
that we can use measurements with unpolarized electrons to correct for false
asymmetries.

The systematic uncertainty of the polarimeter is not only determined by false
asymmetries, but also by the analysis parameters. The main contribution
comes from the energy calibration of the detector. Smaller eﬀects come from
the uncertainty in the energy of the electron beam, the laser polarization and
the parametrisation of the theoretical analysing power, folded with the pa-
rameters of the detector, like the energy resolution. The laser polarization
measured is the average polarization of the whole laser beam. The laser beam
is larger than the electron beam and therefore only its central part interacts
with the electrons. We have measured the laser polarization in a range of
transverse positions and did not observe any variation.

Table 2 shows an overview of all sources of systematic errors for electrons of
440 MeV with a polarization of 0.60. The systematic error will decrease for
higher beam energy, because the Compton asymmetry increases.

4.3 Polarization monitoring

During the ﬁrst data run of experiment 94-05 [21], the polarimeter has been
used to monitor the polarization of the electrons stored in the AmPS ring. This
data run followed immediately after the measurements described in the previ-
ous section. These measurements were also performed with a partial snake at a
beam energy of 440 MeV. The polarization could not be measured simultane-
ously with the experimental data taking, because the background rate due to
3He gas leaking into the IR from the internal target was too high. Therefore,
the electron polarization was measured once a day when no gas was fed into
the internal target.

The long-term stability was investigated from these measurements. They are
sensitive not only to variations of the polarimeter, but also to any other time-
dependent eﬀect such as a degradation of the photo-cathode used at PES. No
trend is observed in the polarization of the electrons (see ﬁg. 10), indicating
a good long-term stability for all components, including the polarimeter.

The average polarization for all measurements and for negative and positive
electron helicity determined with the λ/2-plate in (out) the laser beam was
measured to be 0.615 ± 0.009 ± 0.027 (0.595 ± 0.009 ± 0.027). This is less than
the value measured with the Mott polarimeter (0.69). No polarization loss
was observed during the ﬁrst measurement at 615 MeV (see section 4.1). The
diﬀerence between the two measurements were the beam energy, the settings
of the snake, and the orientation of the spin in the accelerator.

17

The beam energy has no direct eﬀect on the depolarization in the accelerator.
Depolarization can occur in the focussing solenoids in the ﬁrst sections of
the accelerator. Small energy diﬀerences of the electrons can cause diﬀerences
in the spin precession in the lenses, which will result in loss of coherence
of the transverse component of the electron spin. At 615 MeV the spin was
longitudinal in the accelerator and thus was not sensitive for this eﬀect. The
electron spin in the measurements at 440 MeV was completely transverse and
so had maximum sensitivity for depolarization due to the lenses.

The diﬀerence might also be explained by polarization losses during injection,
due to the partial snake. A full snake ensures that the spin tune is 0.5, so
that all possible spin resonances are far away. The spin tune with the partial
snake was 0.05. If this was close to a depolarizing resonance, it is possible
that during injection the spin life time is shorter due to larger synchrotron
oscillations and so cause a loss of polarization during the damping of the
beam. We have measured the spin life time of the damped beam, to be well
over 3600 s which can not explain the losses we have observed.

5 Summary - Conclusions

We have successfully designed, constructed, and operated a Compton po-
larimeter to measure the longitudinal polarization of a stored electron beam.
We have measured the polarization of a stored beam at beam energies of
440 MeV and 615 MeV. The absolute systematic uncertainty has been de-
termined to be 0.027 for electrons at 440 MeV with a polarization of 0.60.
The systematic uncertainty will decrease at higher beam energies. It has been
shown that the polarimeter can be operated routinely and reliably during
the ﬁrst experiment at the internal target facility that made use of polar-
ized electrons. Extra pumping capacity will be installed in the future to make
polarization measurements possible during operation of an internal target.

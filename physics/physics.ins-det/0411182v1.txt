Abstract— We have investigated the depletion voltage changes,
the leakage current increase and the charge collection efﬁciency of
a silicon microstrip detector identical to those used in the inner
layers of the BABAR Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) after heavy
non-uniform irradiation. A full SVT module with the front-end
electronics connected has been irradiated with a 0.9 GeV electron
beam up to a peak ﬂuence of 3.5×1014 e−/cm2, well beyond the
level causing substrate type inversion. We irradiated one of the
two sensors composing the module with a non-uniform proﬁle with
σ=1.4 mm that simulates the conditions encountered in the BABAR
experiment by the modules intersecting the horizontal machine
plane. The position dependence of the charge collection properties
and the depletion voltage have been investigated in detail using a
1060 nm LED and an innovative measuring technique based only
on the digital output of the chip.

I. INTRODUCTION

S EVERAL tests have been made in the past to study the

effects of radiation damage to the BABAR Silicon Vertex
Tracker (SVT) sensors and to their front-end electronics, but the
reduction of charge collection efﬁciency (CCE) after irradiation
has never been measured quantitatively. In addition, it has never
been directly demonstrated that a SVT module can be operated
normally after substrate type-inversion. This is expected to
happen at a dose of (3
1)Mrad, based on measurements
performed on test structures from the same wafers. To address
these issues a module identical to those used in the inner layer
of the SVT, with the front-end electronics connected, has been
irradiated with a 0.9 GeV electron beam. A total peak ﬂuence of
1014e−/cm2, corresponding to a peak dose of 9.3 Mrad,
3.5
has been delivered to the silicon. A second module, which has
not been irradiated, has been used as a control sample to track
variations in the environmental conditions.

ing CP -violating asymmetries and rare branching fractions in

B meson decays. BB pairs are produced in head-on collisions
between 9.0 GeV electrons and 3.1 GeV positrons. Since a
very large sample of B decays is needed, PEP-II was designed
1033 cm−2s−1 (the
to deliver the high peak luminosity of 3
production cross section is σe+e−→BB = 1.1nb)

The Silicon Vertex Tracker [3] has been installed in BABAR in
early 1999 and has been reliably operated for ﬁve years, provid-
ing excellent and efﬁcient vertexing and tracking information.
It is composed of ﬁve layers of 300 µm thick, double-sided
microstrip detectors. p+ strips on one side and n+ strips on the
other side, with orthogonal orientation with respect to the p+
ones, are implanted on a high-resistivity n− bulk. They are AC-
coupled to the electronics via integrated decoupling capacitors.
The detectors are operated in reverse mode at full depletion,
with bias voltage Vbias typically 10V higher than the depletion
voltage Vdepl (which lies in the range 25V–35V). The leakage
current under these conditions is lower than 15µA.

The main source of background in the SVT comes from
showers originated in the material of the beam-pipe by off-
momentum beam particles, which are over-bent by the perma-
nent dipole magnets located in the proximity of the interaction
point to separate the two beams. The dose absorbed by the
silicon, which is measured by means of 12 silicon p-i-n diodes
close to the inner layer of the SVT, varies strongly as a function
of the azimuthal angle around the beamline, and is highly
peaked in a narrow region of the (horizontal) bend plane of the
machine, following a roughly gaussian distribution with σ
2
mm.

≈

The inner layer of the SVT,

located at a radius of 3.3
cm from the beam line, receives the highest dose. At design
luminosity the average dose for the silicon of the inner layer
was expected to be 33 krad/yr, peaking to 240 krad/yr in
the horizontal region. The detectors were therefore originally
designed to withstand up to 2 Mrad of total radiation dose,
which would have been reached, in ten years of running, only
in the inner horizontal region of the SVT, and which is expected
to be less than the dose at which bulk type-inversion occurs.
However, PEP-II excellent performance has been signiﬁcantly
higher than expected. The peak instantaneous luminosity has
1033 cm−2s−1, three times the design value, and is
reached 9
1034 cm−2s−1. A thin horizontal
expected to increase up to 2
region of the inner part of the detector has thus already received
the dose budget of 2 Mrad and will receive 9 Mrad by 2009,

×

×

whereas a larger fraction of silicon in the inner layers away
from the horizontal plane should accumulate a dose between 2
and 5 Mrad by the same date.

III. PRINCIPLE OF THE CCE MEASUREMENT

The basic idea of the measurement is to use a 1060 nm LED,
whose attenuation length λatt = 1 mm is deeper than the 300
µm of the silicon thickness, to generate charges in the sensors.
The charges then drift in the fully depleted silicon and the
signals induced on the microstrip electrodes on the two sides
of the detectors and ampliﬁed by the front-end electronics.

Each readout strip of the sensors, whose pitch is 50 µm
on the n-side and 100 µm on the p-side, is connected to one
of the 128 channels of the AToM IC [4]. The AToM IC is a
custom readout chip produced with a Honeywell rad-hard 0.8
µm CMOS process. It is capable of simultaneous acquisition,
digitization and readout. Each channel of the AToM IC, as
shown in Figure 1, has an analog section consisting of a low-
noise charge-sensitive pre-ampliﬁer followed by a CR-(RC)2
shaper, whose output is coupled differentially into a comparator.
The nominal gain of the pre-ampliﬁer is 250 mV/fC. The
shaping time is programmable, with a minimum of 100 ns,
up to 400 ns. In our measurements we used the 100 ns setting,
which is also used in the modules in the inner layers of the
SVT. The comparator threshold is controlled by an on-chip
6-bit DAC (Thresh DAC) whose least signiﬁcant bit (LSB)
has a nominal value of 12.5 mV, corresponding to a charge
of 0.05 fC at the pre-ampliﬁer’s input. The comparator output
goes to an SRAM pipeline, which provides a trigger latency of
12.93 µs. When the input to the comparator exceeds the pre-set
threshold, the output goes high and a series of ones is clocked
into the pipeline. A calibration charge can be injected into the
preampliﬁer by means of a 50 fF capacitor (Cinj) connected
with a switch to the pre-ampliﬁer input and controlled by a 6-
bit DAC (CAL DAC). The CAL DAC LSB has a nominal value
of 10 mV, corresponding to a charge on the Cinj capacitor of
0.5 fC.

Upon receipt of an external trigger, a selectable region in the
pipeline is searched for a zero-to-one transition. The transition

indicates a “hit” and the number of following ones at the
comparator output, divided by the clock period, represents the
time-over-threshold (TOT) of the hit, which is stored as a 4-bit
number and has an approximately logarithmic dependence on
the input charge. This allows charge measurement over a broad
dynamic range (
40 fC) with a limited number of bits, but the
limited accuracy makes the TOT unsuitable for the purpose of
our measurement, where a good analog resolution is needed in
order to establish small drops in the CCE. Therefore we have
turned to an alternative method of measuring the charge, based
on “threshold scans” [5].

≈

A threshold scan consists in measuring, for each read-out
channel i at ﬁxed injected charge Qi at the input of the pre-
ampliﬁer, the hit efﬁciency as a function of the pre-set threshold
of the comparator, which is varied inside the full dynamic
range. Qi can be either a calibration charge injected through the
calibration capacitor, or the charge induced in read-out channel
i by the charge generated in the silicon by the LED. The 50%
turning point of the hit efﬁciency versus threshold distribution is
the threshold offset Voﬀ (i, Qi) for the channel i at charge Qi, as
shown in Figure 2. The threshold offset has a linear dependence

IV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. Setup for the CCE measurement

The LED is a current-driven EG&G C30116 model, with
peak wavelength λpeak = 1060 nm, risetime trise < 10 ns,
typical peak ﬂux vs LED current φpeak/ILED = 2 mW/A. It is
connected through a 1 kΩ resistor to a GPIB-controlled pulser.
A thin brass foil with a 500 µm diameter pinhole in it is placed
at a distance of 3 mm from the LED lens surface. A converging
lens with focal length f = 45 mm is placed at a distance of 90
mm from the pinhole and at the same distance from the module
plane, thus ensuring that the pinhole image is focused in the
module plane. In our measurements the light emitted from the
LED enters the silicon from the n+-doped (ohmic) side. The
dimension of the luminous spot has been chosen to be narrower
than the region in which the CCE, after irradiation with a beam
2 mm, is supposed to change, but at the same time it
with σ
is large enough that the uncertainty in the relative alignment of
the LED and the silicon detectors (<100 µm) has a negligible
impact on the uncertainty on the measured CCE. The LED,
the pinhole and the lens are mounted inside a brass cilinder
attached to a mechanical arm of a GPIB-controlled X-Y stage.
A picture of the mechanical setup is shown in Figure 3.

≈

The charge generated in the silicon is controlled by changing
the amplitude of the pulse driving the LED. We have selected a
range of amplitudes in which the LED response is linear and the
signal at the shaper output remains within the limited dynamic
range of the THR-DAC, as shown in Figure 4.

The measurement process is fully automated: a workstation
controls via GPIB connections the motion of the X-Y stage
and the voltage setting of the pulser, while at the same time
controls through an ethernet interface a VME-based computer
which is responsible for sending trigger signals to the pulser

and to the readout section of the front end electronics. An
example of the distribution of Si/Gi vs channel measured
with this setup is shown in Figure 5: the peak width is fully
consistent with the pinhole size and the readout pitch of the
strips. Once the Si/Gi distribution has been measured, an
ofﬂine algorithm identiﬁes the position of the peak, evaluates
the baseline in channels away from the peak, and computes the
baseline-subtracted sum ΣiSi/Gi over the whole peak, which
is proportional to the average CCE in the point illuminated by
the LED. Repeated tests on the control module have shown
that the single measurement resolution is about 2%. Alignment
in the relative position between the module and the X-Y stage
and aplanarity effects have been found to introduce negligible
degradation in the CCE resolution. Moreover, no signiﬁcant

variation (compared to the 2% intrinsic resolution) of the
measured CCE has been observed over a period of several hours
of continuous operations. However, differences up to 10% have
been found in CCE measurements performed in different runs.
For this reason the CCE measured for the irradiated module has
always been normalized to the average CCE measured, with a
high number of samplings, in a ﬁxed set of points of the control
module in the same environmental conditions.

B. Setup for the silicon irradiation

The module irradiation has been performed at the Elettra
Synchrotron facility in Trieste with a 0.9 GeV electron beam.
The irradiation has been performed in six steps reaching a total
peak dose of about 9 Mrad. During each irradiation step the
module is mounted on a X-Y stage, which is located at the end
of the Linac and is remotely controlled from the Linac Control
Room through a serial connection. Prior to the irradiation a
radiochromic dosimetry ﬁlm is placed close to the surface of the
silicon, to keep trace of the beam position during the irradiation.
Another radiochromic ﬁlm is placed above the chip region to
check that the electronics does not receive a signiﬁcant dose,
thus avoiding the need in the CCE measurement to disentangle
effects caused by radiation damage to the silicon from effects
caused by damage to the electronics. A third radiochromic ﬁlm
is attached to the edge of the metal frame which hosts the
module and is irradiated for a few seconds (to avoid saturation)
to obtain an image of the beam proﬁle, which is necessary to
estimate the beam size and is used to perform the alignment
between the module and the beam. The beam spot obtained with
this method is shown in Figure 6. Two sets of test structures
from the same wafer as the silicon detectors are mounted on
the module frame in a position which corresponds to the center
of the zone to be irradiated. Two pictures of the module setup
are shown in Figures 7 and 8.

Fig. 6. Beam spot obtained on a radiochromic dosimetry ﬁlm irradiated for
a few seconds.

Fig. 7. Picture of the irradiated module. During the irradiation the beam comes
from the side not shown here. The radiochromic ﬁlm keeps trace (dark stripe
at x≈21 mm) of the beam position. The aluminum foil contains test structures
used as a cross-check for the dose evaluation as described in the text.

After alignment of the module with respect to the beamline,
the linac is turned on and the module is moved back and
forth several times along a line in a plane perpendicular to the
beam. The detector is 82 mm long in the direction (y) of the
irradiation and 42 mm wide in the direction (x) orthogonal
to the irradiation. The beam has a gaussian proﬁle whose
width along the x axis, accurately measured by digitizing and
analyzing the spot obtained on the radiochromic dosimetry ﬁlm
irradiated for a few seconds, is σx
1.4 mm. By moving the
module with constant velocity vy = 1 mm/s a 50 mm long
region of the silicon is irradiated, with a dose proﬁle which is
uniform in y and gaussian in x, centered on the axis of the
module and with width equal to the beam width σx. The beam
remains several centimeters far from the chips during all the
irradiation.

This is not a good estimator when Vdepl is close to 0V, because
in that case there is a bias voltage range in which the detector
is fully depleted but the electric ﬁeld inside it is not intense
enough to achieve signal saturation. Indeed, we see that the

this operation is performed and the linac current Ilinac through

mm, vy = 1 mm/s, Ilinac = 30 nA and Nsweeps = 10), a total peak
1013e−/cm2 (corresponding to a peak
ﬂuence of about 5.3
dose of about 1.4 Mrad) is delivered to the module in about
ten minutes. The linac current is measured with 4% accuracy
from the current ﬂowing in a toroidal coil coaxial with the
beam and is the dominating source of uncertainty in the peak
ﬂuence estimate. A less precise dose estimate, obtained from
the increase in leakage current in the test structures irradiated
with the detector, is used as a cross check and is consistent
with the estimate from the linac current.

After each irradiation step we have measured the leakage

CCE never saturates at bias voltages lower than about 10V.
However, when the depletion voltage is higher than 10V then
Vsat is a good estimator for Vdepl: for instance, prior to the
ﬁrst irradiation step we estimate Vsat
1)V, which is
consistent with the depletion voltage Vdepl = 25V measured in
structure tests from the same wafer. As shown in Figure 10,
the depletion voltage in the damaged silicon ﬁrst decreases
with dose, than starts to increase again. The inversion occurs
at (2.4

of the silicon. After type inversion the detector continues to
operate without any problem.

To conﬁrm that Vsat is a good estimator of the depletion
voltage, which is shifted by bulk damage of the silicon, we
measure - after the second irradiation step, corresponding to
a total peak dose of 2.5 Mrad - Vsat in a set of 21 points,
equally spaced (at 1mm steps), on a line which is orthogonal
to the irradiation direction and crosses the irradiated region.
The distribution of Vsat, shown in Figure 11, exhibits a clear
peak whose width is consistent with the measured beam spread.

C. Charge collection efﬁciency drop

The CCE has been measured, before and after irradiation, in
a grid of 30x30 points spanning almost all the surface of the
irradiated module. The ratio between the CCE measured after
the last irradiation step and the CCE before irradiation, for the
p-side, is shown in Figure 12.

which are at least 4σ away from the irradiation axis and have
received a dose of only a few krad (the lighter lateral rectangles

We have irradiated, with a 0.9 GeV e− beam, a silicon
detector identical to those in the BABAR Silicon Vertex Tracker.
We have implemented a fully automated setup by means of
which we can generate charge in the silicon through illumina-
tion with a 1060 nm LED and measure the charge collection
efﬁciency through an innovative method based on the digital
output of the front-end electronics connected to the detector.
We have measured an increase in leakage current at 23◦C of
0.1)µA/cm2/Mrad. The detector, whose initial depletion
(2.1
voltage was 25V, has undergone type inversion at a dose of
1.0)Mrad, after which it has continued to operate without
(2.4
any problem. We have measured, in points irradiated with a
0.8)Mrad, a moderate charge collection efﬁciency
dose of (8.5
2)% on the
decrease equal to (6

be operated for the whole lifetime of the BABAR experiment
and that bulk damage in the silicon will cause only a modest

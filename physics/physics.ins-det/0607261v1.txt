One of the most important requirements for a detector at the ILC is good jet energy resolution.
It is widely believed that the particle ﬂow approach to calorimetry is the key to achieving the goal
of 0.3/pE(GeV). This paper describes the current performance of the PandoraPFA particle ﬂow
algorithm. For 45 GeV jets in the Tesla TDR detector concept, the ILC jet energy resolution goal
is reached. At higher energies the jet energy resolution becomes worse and can be described by the
empirical expression: σE/E

0.265/pE(GeV) + 1.2

10−4E(GeV).

INTRODUCTION

Many of the interesting physics processes at the ILC will be characterised by multi-jet ﬁnal states, often accompa-
nied by charged leptons and/or missing transverse energy associated with neutrinos or the lightest super-symmetric
particles. The reconstruction of the invariant masses of two or more jets will provide a powerful tool for event
reconstruction and identiﬁcation. Unlike at LEP, where kinematic ﬁtting[1] enabled precise jet-jet invariant mass
reconstruction almost independent of the jet energy resolution, at the ILC this mass reconstruction will rely on the
detector having excellent jet energy resolution. The ILC goal is to achieve a mass resolution for W
qq
decays which is comparable to their natural widths, i.e.
2 GeV. A jet energy resolution of σE/E = α/pE(GeV) leads
to a di-jet mass resolution of roughly σm/m = α/pEjj (GeV), where Ejj is the energy of the di-jet system. At the ILC

II. THE PARTICLE FLOW APPROACH TO CALORIMETRY

It is widely believed that the most promising strategy for achieving a jet energy resolution of σE/E =
0.30/pE(GeV) at the ILC is the particle ﬂow analysis (PFA) approach to calorimetry.
In contrast to a purely
calorimetric measurement, particle ﬂow requires the reconstruction of the four-vectors of all visible particles in an
event. The reconstructed jet energy is the sum of the energies of the individual particles. The momenta of charged
particles are measured in the tracking detectors, while the energy measurements for photons and neutral hadrons
is performed with the calorimetric system. The crucial step of the particle ﬂow algorithm is to assign the correct
calorimeter hits to reconstructed particles, requiring eﬃcient separation of nearby showers.

Measurements of jet fragmentation at LEP have provided detailed information on the particle composition of jets
(e.g. [3, 4]). On average, after the decay of short-lived particles, roughly 62% of the energy of jets is carried by
charged particles (mainly hadrons), around 27% by photons, about 10% by long-lived neutral hadrons (e.g. n/K0
L),
and around 1.5% by neutrinos. Assuming calorimeter resolutions of σE/E = 0.15/pE(GeV) for photons and σE/E =
0.55pE(GeV) for hadrons, a jet energy resolution of 0.19/pE(GeV) is obtained with the contributions from tracks,
photons and neutral hadrons shown in Tab. I. In practice it is not possible to reach this level of performance for
two main reasons. Firstly, particles travelling at small angles to the beam axis will not be detected. Secondly,
and more importantly, it is not possible to perfectly associate all energy deposits with the correct particles. For
example, if a photon is not resolved from a charged hadron shower, the photon energy is not counted. Similarly, if
some of the energy from a charged hadron is identiﬁed as a separate cluster the energy is eﬀectively double-counted.
This confusion degrades particle ﬂow performance. The crucial aspect of particle ﬂow is the ability to correctly

III. THE PANDORAPFA PARTICLE FLOW ALGORITHM

PandoraPFA[5] is a C++ implementation of a PFA algorithm running in the Marlin[6, 7] framework.
It
was designed to be suﬃciently generic for ILC detector optimisation studies and was developed and optimised using
events generated with the Mokka[8] program, which provides a GEANT4[9] simulation of the Tesla TDR[10] detector
concept. The PandoraPFA algorithm performs both calorimeter clustering and particle ﬂow in a single stage. The
algorithm has six main stages:
i) Tracking: for the studies presented in this paper, the track pattern recognition is performed using Monte Carlo
information[6]. The track parameters are then extracted using a helical ﬁt. The projections of tracks onto the front
face of the electromagnetic calorimeter are calculated using helical ﬁts (which do not take into account energy loss
along the track). Neutral particle decays resulting in two charged particle tracks (V 0s) are identiﬁed by searching for
pairs of tracks which do not originate from the interaction point and that are consistent with coming from a single
point in space. Kinked tracks from charged particle decays to a single charged particle and a number of neutrals
are also identiﬁed. When a kink is identiﬁed the parent track is usually removed for the purposes of forming the
reconstructed particles.
ii) Calorimeter Hit Selection and Ordering: isolated hits, deﬁned on the basis of proximity to other hits, are
removed from the initial clustering stage. The remaining hits are ordered into pseudo-layers which follow the detector
geometry so that particles propagating outward from the interaction region will cross successive pseudo-layers. In
most of the calorimeter the pseudo-layers follow the physical layers of the calorimeters except in the barrel-endcap
overlap region and where the ECAL stave structure[10] results in low numbered layers which are far from the front
face of the calorimeter. The assignment of hits to pseudo-layers removes the dependence of the algorithm on the
explicit detector geometry whilst following the actual geometry as closely as possible. Within each pseudo-layer hits
are ordered by decreasing energy.
iii) Clustering: the main clustering algorithm is a forward projective method working from innermost to outermost
pseudo-layer. In this manner hits are added to clusters or are used to seed new clusters. Throughout the clustering
algorithm clusters are assigned a direction (or directions) in which they are growing. The algorithm starts by seeding
clusters using the projections of reconstructed tracks onto the front face of the calorimeter. The initial direction of a
track-seeded cluster is obtained from the track direction. The hits in each subsequent pseudo-layer are then looped
over. Each hit, i, is compared to each clustered hit, j, in the previous layer. The vector displacement, rij, is calculated
and is used to calculate the parallel and perpendicular displacement of the hit with respect to the unit vector(s) ˆu
decribing the cluster propagation direction(s), dk = rij .ˆu and d⊥ =
ˆu
. Associations are made using a cone-cut,
|
d⊥ < dk tan α + βDpad, where α is the cone half-angle, Dpad is the size of a sensor pixel in the layer being considered,
and β is the number of pixels added to the cone radius. Diﬀerent values of α and β are used for the ECAL and HCAL
with the default values set to
respectively. Associations may
, and
be made with hits in the previous 3 layers. If no association is made, the hit is used to seed a new cluster. This
procedure is repeated sequentially for the hits in each pseudo-layer (working outward from ECAL front-face).
iv) Topological Cluster Merging: by design the initial clustering errs on the side of splitting up true clusters
rather than clustering energy deposits from more than one particle. The next stage of the algorithm is to merge
clusters from tracks and hadronic showers which show clear topological signatures of being associated. A number
of track-like and shower-like topologies are searched for including looping minimum ionising tracks, back-scattered

tracks and showers associated with a hadronic interaction. Before clusters are merged, a simple cut-based photon
identiﬁcation procedure is applied. The cluster merging algorithms are only applied to clusters which have not been
identiﬁed as photons.
v) Statistical Re-clustering: The previous four stages of the algorithm were found to perform well for 50 GeV jets.
However, at higher energies the performance degrades rapidly due to the increasing overlap between hadronic showers
from diﬀerent particles. To address this, temporary associations of tracks with reconstructed calorimeter clusters are
made. If the track momentum is incompatible with the energy of the associated cluster re-clustering is performed.
If ECAL
ETRACK > 3.5σE, where σE is the energy resolution of the cluster, the clustering algorithm, described in
iii) and iv) above, is reapplied to the hits in that cluster. This is repeated, using successively smaller values of the
αs and βs in the clustering ﬁnding algorithm (stage iii)) until the cluster splits to give an acceptable track-cluster
energy match. Similarly, if ETRACK
ECAL > 3.5σE the algorithm attempts to merge additional clusters with the
cluster associated with the track. In doing so high energy clusters may be split as above.
vi) Formation of Particle Flow Objects: The ﬁnal stage of the algorithm is to create Particle Flow Objects (PFOs)
from the results of the clustering. Tracks are matched to clusters on the basis of the distance closest approach of the
track projection into the ﬁrst 10 layers of the calorimeter. If a hit is found within 50 mm of the track extrapolation
an association is made. The reconstructed PFOs are written out in Lcio[6] format.

IV. PERFORMANCE

Fig. 1a) shows an example of a PandoraPFA reconstruction of a 100 GeV jet from a Z

uu decay at √s =
200 GeV. The ability to track particles in the high granularity Tesla TDR calorimeter can be seen clearly. Fig. 1b)
< 0.8, where θqq is the polar angle
shows the total PFA reconstructed energy for Z
of the generated qq system. These events were generated at √s = 91.2 GeV using the Tesla TDR detector model.
The root-mean-square deviation from the mean (rms) of the distribution is 4.0 GeV. However, quoting the rms as
a measure of the performance over-emphasises the importance of the tails. For example, in this ﬁgure, the central
peak is well described by a Gaussian of width 2.9 GeV, equivalent to a resolution of σE/E = 0.31/pE(GeV). In
this paper two measures of the performance are quoted. The ﬁrst measure, rms90, is the rms in the smallest range
of reconstructed energy which contains 90 % of the events. The second performance measure is obtained from a ﬁt
to the reconstructed energy distribution. The ﬁt function is the sum of two Gaussian distributions with a common
mean but diﬀerent widths. The width of the narrower Gaussian, which is constrained to contain 75 % of the events,
gives a measure of the resolution in the peak, σ75. For the data shown in Fig. 1b) both methods give a resolution

jets will be higher in energy.

The majority of interesting ILC physics will consist of ﬁnal states with at least six fermions, setting a “typical”
energy scale for ILC jets as approximately 85 GeV and 170 GeV at √s = 500 GeV and √s =1 TeV respectively.

V. DISCUSSION

The results described above are summarised in Tab. II. The observed jet energy resolution in simulated events
is not described by the expression σE/E = α/pE(GeV). This is not surprising, as the particle density increases
it becomes harder to correctly associate the calorimetric energy deposits to the particles and the confusion term
increases. Empirically it is found that the total energy resolutions in Tab. II can be described by a jet energy
10−4E(GeV), where E is the jet energy. This expression represents the
resolution of σE/E = 0.265/pE(GeV) + 1.2

hadronic showers which may not be fully contained in the HCAL. In the current version of PandoraPFA no attempt
is made to correct for this energy leakage. It is noticeable in Fig. 2b that the energy resolution improves with increasing
polar angle in the barrel region of the detector, possibly due to increasing shower containment.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

5

Particle ﬂow calorimetry is widely believed to be the key to reaching the ILC jet energy resolution goal of σE/E =
0.3/pE(GeV). Consequently, the design and optimisation of detectors for the ILC depends both on hardware and
on sophisticated software reconstruction. For the Tesla TDR detector concept, the PandoraPFA particle ﬂow
algorithm achieves good performance, < 0.4/pE(GeV), for jet energies upto about 100 GeV. For higher energies
the performance degrades signiﬁcantly reaching the equivalent of 0.6/pE(GeV) for 200 GeV jets. With further
optimisation of the algorithm the performance is expected to improve. However, the current algorithm is adequate for
most ILC physics studies at √s = 500 GeV and may be used for the optimisation of the design of the ILC detector(s).

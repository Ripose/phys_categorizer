0νββ decay search with enriched germanium (Ge) detectors

Measurements with a bare p-type high purity germanium diode (HPGe) submerged in a 19 kg liquid argon
(LAr) scintillation detector at MPIK-Heidelberg are reported. The liquid argon–germanium system (LArGe) is
operated as a 4π anti-Compton spectrometer to suppress backgrounds in the HPGe. This R&D is carried out in
the framework of the Gerda experiment which searches for 0νββ decays with HPGe detectors enriched in 76Ge.
The goal of this work is to develop a novel method to discriminate backgrounds in 0νββ search which would
ultimately allow to investigate the eﬀective neutrino mass free of background events down to the inverse mass
hierarchy scale. Other applications in low-background counting are expected.

1. Introduction

The goal of the Germanium Detector Array
(Gerda) [1] is to search for neutrinoless dou-
ble beta decays of 76Ge. Bare germanium de-
tectors (HPGe), isotopic enriched in germanium
76Ge, will be operated in liquid argon (LAr). The
cryogenic ﬂuid serves simultaneously as a cooling
medium and as a shield against external radia-
tion. R&D is carried out to use the scintilla-
tion light of LAr to tag and discriminate back-
grounds. The concept and the proof of principle
were ﬁrst reported in [2]. The signature for 0νββ
decay of 76Ge is a point-like energy deposition
with Qββ = 2.039 MeV inside a HPGe diode.
Background events come mainly from radioactive
decays and muon induced interactions. These
events deposit typically only a part of their energy
inside a HPGe crystal while the residual energy is
dissipated in the adjacent shielding material. De-
tecting the scintillation light of LAr would allow
to discriminate these events. The work presented
here is an R&D project within the framework of
the Gerda experiment.

from oxygen or water traces. Low activity cal-
ibration sources can be inserted up to 8 mm from
the HPGe crystal via a hermetically closed stain-
less steel tube. The DAQ is triggered by the
HPGe diode. The HPGe and PMT signals are
then recorded event-by-event and stored for the
oﬀ-line analysis on disk. HPGe signals are dis-
carded in the analysis if a simultaneous scintilla-
tion signal has been recorded. An analysis thresh-
old at the single photo electron level was applied.
A photo electron (pe) yield of about 410 pe/MeV
was observed during these measurements.

3. Measurements

The measurement were performed from Oc-
tober to December 2005 using various gamma
sources (137Cs, 60Co, 232Th, 226Ra), alternated
with periods of background measurements. Given
the limited space available in this proceedings, we
present only the results achieved with the 232Th
gamma source. The source consists of a natural
thorium metal wire thus containing 228Th and its
progeny 208Tl. The measured energy spectrum
is displayed in Fig. 2. The line histograms corre-
spond to spectra without background subtraction
and the ﬁlled histograms after background sub-
traction. The bottom plot shows a zoom in the
region of interest for 0νββ.

The survival probability Ps is deﬁned as the
number of counts in a given energy region after
applying the LAr anti-coincidence cut divided by
the number of counts in the same region in the
non-vetoed spectrum and the suppression factor
is deﬁned as Sf = 1−Ps. The background spectra
have been measured separately and subtracted
prior to forming the ratio. For single gamma de-
cays as for example for the 662 keV 137Cs line,
the full energy (FE) peak is not suppressed after
applying the LAr anti-coincidence cut, since no
energy deposition occurs in the LAr. The mea-
sured value for 137Cs is Ps = 1.00 ± 0.01.

An important background source for 0νββ is
the photons emitted in the decay of 208Tl, a
progeny of 232Th. As the 208Tl 2615 keV gamma
is part of a gamma cascade in the deexcitation
of 208Tl, the FE peak is suppressed in case that
a second gamma deposits energy inside the LAr.

Compton events which deposit an energy close
to Qββ = 2039 keV inside the crystal are vetoed
with Sf = 0.94 ± 0.01, or in other words, the
Compton continuum is suppressed by a factor 17.

sured with 137Cs, 232Th and 226Ra are well re-
produced within typically 5% or better. Fig. 3
shows the simulated 232Th spectrum. The back-
ground spectrum (gray) measured without source
is added to the MC spectrum describing the
source. Note that the 232Th source is not in sec-
ular equilibrium, thus the poor agreement at low
energies. The survival probability after apply-
ing the LAr veto cut at 2039 keV obtained with
MaGe MC simulation corresponds to Sf = 0.97.
A possible origin of the higher MC value may be
related to the simpliﬁed geometrical description
of the crystal holder which had small LAr dead
volumes not included in the simulation.

5. Conclusion and outlook

The experimental data show that the detec-
tion of LAr scintillation photons is a powerful
method to suppress backgrounds with negligible
loss of 0νββ signals.
In the setup with an ac-
tive LAr mass of 19 kg we observed a background
suppression of the 208Tl Compton continuum at
2039 keV by a factor of 17. The suppression
factor is limited by gammas escaping from the
small LAr volume. MaGe MC simulations re-
produce the energy spectra as well as the sup-
pression factors. An ultra-low background pro-
totype setup is presently under construction at
Lngs (Gerda-LArGe). The purpose of the de-
vice is to study the novel suppression method at
ultra-low backgrounds with an active LAr mass of
approximately 1 ton. The instrument will be used
to study the background of Gerda phase I detec-
tor assemblies prior to their operation in Gerda.
Applications of the method as an anti-Compton
spectrometer for trace analysis is envisioned.

Abstract. Several improvements were made for Nuclear Track Detectors (NTDs) used for environmental
studies and for particle searches. A new method was used to determine the bulk etch rate of CR39 and
Makrofol NTDs. It is based on the simultaneous measurement of the diameter and of the height of etch-pit
cones caused by relativistic heavy ions (158 A GeV Pb82+ and In49+ ions) and their fragments. The use
of alcohol in the etching solution improves the surface quality of NTDs and it raises their thresholds. The
detectors were used for the determination of nuclear fragmentation cross sections of Iron and Silicon ions
of 1.0 and 0.41 GeV/nucleon. These measurements are important for the determination of doses in hadron
therapy and for doses received by astronauts. The detectors were also used in the search of massive particles
in the cosmic radiation, for the determination of the mass spectrum of cosmic rays and for the evaluation
of Po210 α-decay and of natural radon concentrations.

1 Introduction

Nuclear Track Detectors (NTDs) were used to search for magnetic monopoles, nuclearites
and nuclear fragments with fractional charges [1-3]. They were also been used for the
determination of nuclear fragmentation cross-sections [4-6], the measurement of the primary
cosmic ray composition [7] and radon measurements [8]. Most studies were performed with
CR39 NTDs, which have thresholds of Z/β ≥ 5.

In this paper are described the most favourable etching conditions to obtain the best
surface quality and reduce the number of background tracks in the CR39 and Makrofol
NTD’s used in the Search for Intermediate Mass Magnetic monopoles in SLIM and in other
experiments. Formerly we used aqueous solutions of NaOH and KOH [9-11]. The addition
of ethyl alcohol in the etchant improves the etched surface quality, reduces the number of
surface defects and background tracks at the expense of a higher detection threshold. We
studied in detail the etching conditions adding diﬀerent percentages of ethyl alcohol. Special
care was also paid to proper stirring and temperature control of the solutions.

For the study of the response of NTDs we used beams of 158 A GeV Lead and Indium
ions at CERN, 1 A GeV Fe26+ and Si14+ ions at BNL, USA and 0.41 A GeV Fe26+ at
HIMAC, Japan.

The NTDs were then used for the determination of fragmentation cross sections and for

the detection of environmental contaminations [12].

2 Experimental

After exposures the detectors were etched in temperature controlled etching baths (to ± 0.1
◦C). In order to have a homogeneous solution during the etching and to avoid the deposit
of etched products on the detector surfaces, the stirring was kept constant during the whole
etching cycle.

The etchants used were water solutions of 6N NaOH and 6N KOH with diﬀerent fractions
of ethyl alcohol. These are called “soft” etching conditions. We also used “strong” etching
conditions in order to fastly reduce the thickness of the detectors. For this case we used
mainly 8N NaOH, 7N KOH, 8N KOH water solutions. In these conditions many background
tracks of 10 to 17 µm range were found; they were probably due to carbon, oxygen and proton
recoils produced in the interactions of neutrons. Moreover the surface quality was not very
good.

Recently we added alcohol in the following conditions:
Soft etching: For Makrofol we used a 6N KOH solution with 20% ethyl alcohol by volume
at 50 ◦C. For CR39 we used 6N NaOH and KOH at 70 and 60 ◦C with 1, 2 and 3% ethyl
alcohol.

After etching, the detectors were cleaned and dried in air and the etched tracks were

measured with the ELBEK automatic measuring system [13].

The presence of alcohol polishes the detector surfaces, improves the transparency of the

post-etched detectors and increases the bulk etching velocity.

Strong etching: The Makrofol sheets were etched in 6N KOH solutions with 20% ethyl
alcohol at 65 ◦C for 6 h. The transparency of the detectors was good enough for scanning
with a stereo microscope. With this etching condition the thickness was reduced from 500
µm to about 220 µm.

The CR39 sheets from “wagons” exposed at the high altitude Chacaltaya lab. (5230 m
a.s.l.) were strongly etched in a solution 8N KOH at 75 ◦C with 1.5% ethyl alcohol for 30
h.

For soft etching the CR39 threshold is at Z/β ∼ 6-7; for strong etching it is at Z/β ∼17-

19.

3 Calibration

The bulk-etch rate vB was previously determined by measuring the mean thickness diﬀerence
before and after etching; we used an electronic depth-measuring instrument with a 1 µm
accuracy.

For relativistic charged particles the track etch rate vT can be considered constant. We
measured vB by another method; for normally incident particles, the measurable quantities
are the cone base diameter D, and the height Le, see Fig. 1.

The following two relations hold:

Le = (vT − vB)t , D = 2vBtv
u

t

(vT − vB)
(vT + vB)

From the above two relations the solution for vB is

Relations (1-2) were tested with relativistic Pb and In ions and their fragments in both
CR39 and Makrofol NTDs. We selected only those tracks for which precise measurements of
the cone height and diameter was possible. Then, using eq. (2) we computed the bulk-etch
rate.

Figure 1: Sketch of an “etched track” in one side of the detector for a normally incident ion.

After “soft” etching of the CR39 and Makrofol sheets the cone base areas of the projectile
ions and their fragments were measured with the ELBEK system. Fig. 2a shows the base
area distribution of Pb ions and their fragments in Makrofol. The peaks are well separated
from Z/β ∼51 to 77. The charge resolution close to the Pb peak was improved by measuring
the heights of the etch-pit cones (see the inset of Fig. 2b). For each detected nuclear
fragment we computed the REL and the reduced etch rate p=vT /vB using the formula
[14-15]

1 + (D/2vBt)2
1 − (D/2vBt)2
where ’D’ is the diameter of the track, vT and vB are the track and bulk etch velocities

p =

and t is the etching time.

The reduced etch rate p versus REL is plotted in Figures 3a,b for CR39 and Makrofol.
The detection thresholds are at REL ∼ 50 and 2500 MeV cm2 g−1 for CR39 and Makrofol
detectors, respectively (Fig. 3a). A unique calibration curve was obtained for diﬀerent
high-energy heavy ions in CR39 (Fig. 3b).

4 Total Charge Changing Cross Sections

For the determination of the total charge changing cross sections, σtot, we used beams of 158
A GeV Pb82+ ions, 1 A GeV Fe26+ and Si14+ and 0.41 A GeV Fe26+ on diﬀerent targets. We
measured the number of incident and survived ions before and after each target material.
The fragmentation charge-changing cross section was evaluated using the formula

(4)
where XT = AT /ρT ·tT ·NA; Ni is the number of primary ions, NS the number of survived
ions after the target. AT , ρT and tT are the mass number, density and thickness of the target
material.

σtot(exp) = XT · ln(Ni / Ns)

The cross section on hydrogen was obtained by subtracting the C from the CH2 total

charge changing cross sections using the following relation

These measurements were compared with the calculations based on the equation (see

The experimental total charge changing cross sections increase with increasing target
mass number. From Table 1 it is seen that for the CH2 target the total cross sections
increase with the increase of the projectile energy.

5 Alpha Radioactivity Measurement

The α-radioactivity from Po210 of the OPERA lead plates with 0.07% Ca or 2.5% Sb were
measured with CR39 NTDs and a Surface Barrier Silicon Detector (SBSiD) [16]; comparison
of the obtained results are shown in Figure 4. We refreshed the CR39 sheets with our
improved etching conditions before α-activity measurements i.e. we removed all the pre
exposure α-activity due to radon or defects in CR39 NTDs. The exposure set up is sketched
in the inset of Fig. 4.

6 Conclusions

With use of alcohol we have improved the quality of the post etched surface, removed
background and enhanced the sharpness of the tracks in CR39 and Makrofol NTDs, but the

thresholds are higher. New calibrations curves were obtained with Pb82+, In49+, Fe26+ and
Si14+ relativistic heavy ions and improved measuring techniques [17-18].

The use of CR39 and Makrofol detectors etched with alcohol can be useful for experiments
having a substantial background originated by local sources and in the case of cosmic ray
long duration balloon ﬂights, or space experiments.

The measured total charge changing cross sections are in agreement with the calculation
based on eq. 6 within statistical standard deviations. On the basis of our results, we conclude
that NTDs, especially CR39, can be used for high energy experimental cross section studies.
The improved etching and analysis methods can be applied for the detections of alpha
particles from radon and for environmental dosimetry. We successfully applied this new
procedure for the measurements of alpha radioactivity in lead plates.

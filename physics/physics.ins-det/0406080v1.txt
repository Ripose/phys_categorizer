Abstract

I propose a new optoelectronic device that completely and instantaneously measures

the incident light’s polarization for a narrow wavelength band in a single physical

pixel. The device has four (or more) quantum-well active regions separated and

topped by four (or more) linear gratings at diﬀerent orientations. Electrical contact

is made to each grating and to a bottom contact layer to measure four (or more)

photocurrents. The device uses interference among many light paths to encode in

four photocurrents four values that completely describe the polarization state of the

incident light at a given wavelength. I begin with the motivation for the new device.

Then, I report on two computational models: the ﬁrst includes perfectly conducting

gratings, and the second includes more realistic dielectric gratings. Next, I will

describe the design and processing of a two-layer proof-of-concept device. Last, I

will recount the trials of the ﬁrst round of fabrication.

Polarimetry background

1.1 Imaging polarimetry

An imaging polarimeter captures an image with both the intensity and some mea-

sure of the polarization state recorded for each pixel. A polarimetric image has more

information than a simple intensity image and improves remote sensing and auto-

matic target recognition [27]. Polarimetry can be used to identify materials and to

distinguish samples from a cluttered background [31]. Polarimetry has also shown

promise for mine detection [12]. On average, the pixels of polarimetric images of

man-made objects have a higher degree of polarization (DOP) than the pixels of

polarimetric images of natural objects. This pattern could be useful for spectro-

polarimetric target detection with a target ﬁlling one pixel or less. Polarimetric data

is often represented in terms of Stokes parameters.

The four Stokes parameters[6], which represent all the polarization information,

are: S0 = I0 + I90, S1 = I0 −

polarized fraction of the light.

The Stokes parameters have several useful properties. If you place the four pa-

rameters into a four-dimensional vector (called a Stokes vector), they form a linear

vector space. This means that the Stokes vector of two beams of light added in-

coherently is the linear sum of the Stokes vector of each original beam. The S0 is

There are many approaches to imaging polarimetry instrument design. Some

polarimeters only measure linear polarization and intensity (S1, S2, and S0). Others

will measure all four Stokes parameters. The choice of which combination of Stokes

parameters to measure depends on the application. A full-Stokes-vector polarimeter

will measure all four Stokes parameters at every pixel.

1.2 Other polarimeter designs

The current technology of imaging polarimeters cannot reliably measure high-spatio-

temporal polarization or high-spectral-resolution polarization of a moving scene; the

camera reports huge errors at the boundaries of objects in the scene or trades-oﬀ

spatial and spectral resolution to achieve faster measurements.

The errors at the boundaries of scene-objects occur because a typical imaging

polarimeter collects several diﬀerent images of the same object, with the light ema-

nating from the object passing through a diﬀerent polarization ﬁlter in each image.

The collected images are linearly combined with positive and negative weights to ex-

tract the polarization state at each pixel. To perform the subtraction, one registers

pixels from the diﬀerent images that represent the same point in the scene. However,

because the images are taken at diﬀerent times, any motion in the image will cause a

registration error. Registration errors lead to subtracting two values that should be

of the same object but are not of the same object. The diﬀerence will falsely report

a polarization in the image with errors in the range of 100% [25].

3

Chapter 1. Polarimetry background

U. S. Patent No. 5,045,701 by Goldstein and Chipman describes one such device.

They use a rotating quarter-wave plate with a ﬁxed linear ﬁlter. With a single focal

plane, this device takes several images at diﬀerent rotations, respectively, of the

polarizing ﬁlter. Again, the collected images are linearly combined with positive and

negative weights to extract the polarization state at each pixel. Again, one must

register the pixels from the diﬀerent images that represent the same point in the

scene. As described before, any motion in the image will cause a registration error.

This precludes the use of this apparatus to obtain polarimetric images of terrestrial

objects from moving platforms, such as airplanes or orbiting satellites, or images of

objects that are translating or rotating with respect to the apparatus.

Beekman and Van Anda used neighboring pixels to detect diﬀerent polarizations;

again the pixels are misregistered by one pixel width [4]. This approach uses quantum

well infrared photodetectors with linear gratings. Quantum wells can only detect

the component of light with the electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the growth direction

[16, 19]. With linear gratings, each pixel can only detect the component of the

incident light with the electric ﬁeld perpendicular the grooves of the grating. On

a single focal plane, Beekman and Van Anda made neighboring pixels sensitive to

vertical, horizontal or diagonal polarizations by using vertical, horizontal or diagonal

gratings. Again, one linearly combines the neighboring pixels sensitive to the diﬀerent

polarizations with positive and negative weights. Because the pixels being combined

image spatially neighboring points in the scene, sharp edges or bright points will

register as erroneous polarization.

Another approach uses four separate cameras with a diﬀerent polarization ﬁlter on

each camera. The four cameras take simultaneous images of the same scene. Again,

the appropriate images are linearly combined with positive and negative weights to

extract the four Stokes parameters; however, parallax and camera misalignment will

introduce registration errors into the derived image. Polarization error follows due

4

Chapter 1. Polarimetry background

to registration errors.

In a brand new type of spectral-polarimeter, pixel registration is achieved but

spectral resolution is sacriﬁced [11]. In this case, the pixels reading nearby groups of

spectral lines contain the polarization data. Due to this source of error, sharp spec-

tral features will induce polarization errors. This example is called a polarimetric

spectral intensity modulation spectropolarimeter, and is described in U. S. Patent

No. 6,490,043 by Kebabian. This device measures the polarization of a single point

in a scene by modulating the spectrum of the light with the polarization of the light

and then measuring the spectrum of the light on a row of pixels. In order to ﬁnd

the polarization one must compare the modulated spectrum to the true spectrum.

Because the true spectrum is not known, approximations must be made that nec-

essarily sacriﬁce polarimetric and spectral accuracy and precision in favor of pixel

registration. Their approach of encoding the polarization in the spectrum is very

similar to approaches described at the Japanese SICE conference by Oka [23] and

Locke [20]. Another polarimeter design that also records the polarization as a spatial

pattern on the focal plane array is explained by Van Delden [9].

All current polarimeters are lacking in one of three areas. First is registration

errors: the error is maximum at the boundaries of objects in a scene. The second

diﬃculty is sacriﬁcing spectral resolution: sharp spectral features still introduce er-

rors. The third is a sacriﬁce in spatial resolution: one must trade-oﬀ the weight

and volume of imaging optics, which normally limit resolution, with the weight and

volume of beam splitters needed to divide the image onto several focal-plane arrays.

Introduction to a

polarimeter-in-a-pixel

The topic of this thesis is a device that should detect the full-polarization at each

pixel, and at each frame, and at each wavelength. The device was ﬁrst introduced

in reference [29], and was also reported on in references [30, 7]. In this chapter, I

describe the device.

2.1 Device description

In the device, shown in ﬁgure 2.1, quantum-well stacks are used in combination with

linear gratings to determine the degree of polarization of incident light in terms of

Stokes parameters. Interference from multiple reﬂections, diﬀractions and transmis-

sions of the light propagating from and through the linear gratings modulates the

absorption of the

1-diﬀracted orders at each quantum-well stack. The quantum-

±

well stacks, do not absorb light having an electric ﬁeld component in a plane parallel

to the quantum well stacks [16, 19]. The non-absorbed propagating light is reﬂected,

diﬀracted and transmitted at each grating as a function of its polarization. Interfer-

ence translates the incident polarization into the amount of polarized light having

an electric ﬁeld with a component in the z-direction. This z-polarized component of

the light is absorbed by the quantum wells.

Each quantum-well stack is included in a separate circuit having a voltage bias

and a current meter. The voltage bias across each circuit is individually adjusted,

and the photocurrent in each circuit, as measured by the respective current meter,

is proportional to the ﬂux of light absorbed by the respective quantum-well stack.

7

Chapter 2.

Introduction to a polarimeter-in-a-pixel

The circuit diagram is similar to that of multi-color QWIP devices [10].

The four photocurrents are thus a measure of the polarization of the incident

light by measuring what is ultimately absorbed by each of the four quantum well

stacks. More particularly, the four currents are linearly mapped to the four Stokes

parameters, which, in turn, represent the polarization of the incident light.

2.2 Principle of operation

To explain the principle underlying the polarization detection, consider a current-

technology quantum-well photodetector including single quantum-well stack with a

single linear grating and consider a simpliﬁed embodiment of the present invention

with just two quantum-well stacks and two linear gratings. Using the single layer

of gratings, this section will show the relevant physics of the quantum-well polar-

ization selection rule for absorption, and the relevant physics of diﬀraction from a

single grating. Using the two-layer structure, this section will show how the incident

photons are split and then interfere to gain additional polarization sensitivity.

2.2.1 Single-layer device

The quantum wells, and thus the quantum-well stacks, only absorb light with an

electric ﬁeld in the z-direction [16, 19]. Figures 2.2 (a) and (b) show two diﬀer-

ent polarizations of light propagating through a current-technology quantum-well

infrared detector(QWIP). The QWIP is equipped with a linear grating in the x-

direction (out of the page). This subsection will show that only the y-polarized light

is absorbed.

Because the electric ﬁeld is always perpendicular to the direction of travel, light

the polarization selection rule, the incident beam and the reﬂected beam are not

absorbed – only the diﬀracted light has a chance of being absorbed.

Figure 2.2 (a) shows how the diﬀraction grating enables light to be absorbed by

the quantum wells. The incident light is not absorbed on the ﬁrst pass through the

quantum well material. The reﬂected light is also not absorbed. The diﬀracted light

has the electric ﬁeld shifted into a component parallel to the z-axis. This light is

absorbed.

A linear grating preserves the fast polarization (electric ﬁeld parallel to the grating

grooves) of light incident from the plane perpendicular to the grooves of the grating.

Thus, the x-polarized light will be diﬀracted into x-polarized diﬀracted orders. As

shown in ﬁgure 2.2 (b), the diﬀracted x-polarized light is still perpendicular to the

In this way, a simple QWIP with a linear grating can only detect the y-polarized

component of the incident light. However, the single pixel just described will give the

same response for a ﬁxed intensity of 45-degree polarized light, 135-degree polarized

light, right-circularly polarized light, left-circularly polarized light, and unpolarized

light.

Introduction to a polarimeter-in-a-pixel

2.2.2 Two-layer test structure

To understand how my new device works, this section follows two paths of light

through a simpliﬁed two-layer embodiment of the invention. To show an improvement

over the old technology, I need to show how this new invention can distinguish 45-

degree from 135-degree polarization in a single pixel.

The non-absorbed z-propagating light is reﬂected, diﬀracted and transmitted at

each grating as a function of its polarization. One key element is that linear gratings

also have polarization-dependent physics [26, 14]. Grating diﬀraction eﬃciency is

diﬀerent for fast polarization (no magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the grating’s grooves)

and slow polarization (no electric ﬁeld parallel to the grating’s grooves).

For example, consider light with a 2.5 µm wavelength normally incident on a

perfectly conducting grating with a 3 µm period, 1.5 µm grooves, and 0.75 µm

depth. The fast polarization will be 14% reﬂected (into the 0th order) and 43%

diﬀracted into the

1 orders, and the slow-polarization will be 30% reﬂected (into

0th order) and 35% diﬀracted into the

1 orders. In addition, polarized light incident

±

on a linear grating will have a relative phase shift between the diﬀracted fast and

slow polarization components [14].

In the case of a single grating, for a ﬁxed intensity of light, we could distinguish

x-polarized from y-polarized, but we could not distinguish 45-degree-polarized from

135-degree-polarized.

I will now describe how interference from the second linear

grating at an angle of 45 degrees will modulate the photocurrent measured across

the quantum wells before the ﬁrst grating.

Each incident photon is split at each grating and takes several paths through

the device. Figure 2.3 shows an example of two paths that light can take that cre-

ate polarization dependent interference and therefore lead to polarization dependent

photocurrent. Recall, the actual device has four or more layers and many interfering

11

Chapter 2.

Introduction to a polarimeter-in-a-pixel

paths. I will just trace through two simple paths.

For 45-degree-polarized incident light, the ﬁrst path consists of a diﬀraction of

light from the grating along the x-axis. I deﬁne that when the incident light reaches

the ﬁrst grating, the phase is 180 degrees. After diﬀraction, the component of the

reﬂected +1 order that is polarized in the y-z plane has a phase of 105 degrees.

For 45-degree-polarized incident light, the second path consists of the transmis-

sion of the incident light through ﬁrst grating. Transmission through this grating

causes the light to become somewhat elliptically polarized with a major axis along

the 45-degree orientation. The component of the light polarized in the y-z plane

has a phase of -90. The propagation of light from ﬁrst grating to grating second

grating advances the phase by 400 degrees. At the second grating, the light reﬂects

backward, and the light component in the y-z plane now has a phase of 415 degrees.

The magnitude and the phase shift in the light after reﬂection from a linear grating

is highly dependent on the polarization of the light with respect to the grating. The

light advances another 400 degrees in phase while propagating back towards the ﬁrst

grating. After the light forward diﬀracts from this ﬁrst grating, the phase becomes

915 degrees, which is equivalent to 105 degrees + 90 degrees. We compare with 105

degrees because this was the phase of the light that took the ﬁrst path, i.e. was

diﬀracted and reﬂected to the +1 order.

Since the phases polarized in the y-z plane from these two paths do not cancel

out, the quantum-well stack will absorb the light and generate a photocurrent. The

absorption by quantum-well stack is proportional to the vector sum of the light from

these two paths. The two paths have a phase diﬀerence of 90, and therefore the two

paths do not interfere constructively or destructively. This leads to a measurable

amount of photocurrent across quantum well stack.

Next consider 135-degree polarized incident light. Again, I deﬁne that when the

12

Chapter 2.

Introduction to a polarimeter-in-a-pixel

incident light reaches the ﬁrst grating, the phase is 180 degrees. Since the light is

normally incident, the quantum-well stack cannot absorb the light as it ﬁrst enters

the device . Again, interference exists between two possible paths that the photon

can take. The interference is found by following a photon through two paths, which

are in principle the same photon.

For 135-degree-polarized incident light, the ﬁrst path consists of a diﬀraction

from the ﬁrst grating to the reﬂected and diﬀracted +1 order. The component of

the diﬀracted light polarized in the y-z plane will have a phase of 105 degrees.

For 135-degree-polarized incident light, the second path consists of the trans-

mission of the incident light through the ﬁrst grating. After transmission through

this ﬁrst grating, the light is slightly elliptically polarized with a major axis along

the 135-degree orientation. The component of the light polarized in the y-z plane

has a phase of -90 degrees. The propagation of the light from the ﬁrst grating up

to the second grating advances the phase by 400 degrees. After reﬂection from the

second grating, the light as a phase in the y-z plane of 505 degrees. This is the step

that diﬀerentiates between incident light polarized along 45-degree and 135-degree

axes. The reﬂection from the second grating gives a very diﬀerent phase shift when

the light is polarized with versus perpendicular to the grating grooves. Next, the

light advances another 400 degrees in phase while propagating back towards the ﬁrst

grating. After the light forward diﬀracts from this ﬁrst grating it is now in the same

mode as the light that originally reﬂected and diﬀracted into the +1 order. The

phase in the y-z plane is now 1005 degrees, which is equivalent to 105 degrees + 180

degrees.

The absorption by quantum-well stack is proportional to the vector sum of light

from both paths. The two paths have a phase diﬀerence of 180 degrees, and there-

fore the two paths interfere destructively. This leads to a negligible amount of pho-

tocurrent across quantum-well stack. Therefore, the photocurrent across this ﬁrst

13

Chapter 2.

Introduction to a polarimeter-in-a-pixel

quantum-well stack changes for 45-degree polarized incident light compared to 135-

degree polarized incident light.

In this example, I have traced through two paths from a two-layer device. To

predict the actual photocurrents of the actual device, I would need to trace through

thousands of paths in a structure with four or more layers. This process is done

through a computer model described in the next chapter.

14

Chapter 3

Modeling the complete four-layer

polarimeter-in-a-pixel

In order to validate the principle-of-operation described in the previous chapter,

I developed a working electromagnetic model of the device using transfer-matrix

techniques described in Andersson [1, 2] and Wendler [33]. The code was written in

GNU C++ on windows-based computers and is available upon request.

Figures 3.1 and 3.2 show some results of this working electromagnetic model

of the proposed device. On the graph’s ordinate, the fraction of incident light ab-

sorbed in the four quantum-well stacks respectively for 9.5 micron incident light.

The abscissa of ﬁgure 3.1 shows the angle of linearly polarized incident light. The

abscissa of ﬁgure 3.2 shows the phase lag between 0-degree polarized incident light

and 90-degree polarized incident light. The phase lag smoothly changes the polar-

ization from 45-degree linear to right circular to 135-degree linear to left circular.

The graph demonstrates that the relative photocurrents from the four quantum-well

stacks provide a means to measure the polarization of incident light.

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

3.1 The transfer-matrix method

The model that generated ﬁgures 3.1 and 3.2 is based on a transfer-matrix method.

A transfer-matrix approach breaks the problem down into slabs. The modes in each

slab are found separately. Boundary conditions at the interface between the slabs

relate the electromagnetic state in one slab to the neighboring slabs. Each slab must

be uniform along the z-axis. The N slabs are designated by the index ν:

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

ν = N
...

hN −1 < z
...

ν = 3

h2 < z < h3

ν = 2

h1 < z < h2

ν = 1

z < h1,

where hν are the z positions of the interfaces between each slab.

The ﬁelds in each slab, F (ν) (either an electric or magnetic ﬁeld) are represented

by a sum of coeﬃcients multiplied by mode functions,

F (ν)
s

(x, y, z) =

C (ν)

s,m,±Ψ(ν)

s,m,±(x, y, z),

m,±
X

where C (ν) are the coeﬃcients and Ψ(ν) are the mode functions. The index m rep-

resents the x, y component of the wave vector for that particular mode. Up-going

modes are denoted (+) where kz > 0, and down-going modes (-) where kz < 0.

The index s indicates which of two states one is in for each wave vector. The two

states could be TE and TM or fast and slow. For TE modes, the electric ﬁeld has

no z-component. For TM modes, the magnetic ﬁeld has no z-component. For fast

modes, the magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the grating grooves vanishes. For slow modes,

the electric ﬁeld parallel to the grating grooves vanishes.

16

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

The ﬁeld F (ν)

s

is chosen so that the 6 components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

are implicitly stored in at most 2 components. For example, the electric ﬁeld in the
direction ˆk
ˆz for TE modes and the magnetic ﬁeld in the direction ˆk
ˆz for TM
modes. Given these two components and the wave vector ~km for the particular mode,

×

×

one can ﬁnd all 6 components of the electric and magnetic vector ﬁelds.

The coeﬃcients C (ν)

s,m,± in each slab are collected into a vector that succinctly

represents the ﬁelds in that slab.

Because the tangental ﬁelds are continuous across the boundary of each slab,

we can easily ﬁnd the coeﬃcients that represent the ﬁeld in slab ν if we know the

coeﬃcients in slab ν +1. The matrix that relates these two sets of coeﬃcients is called

a transmission matrix. The transmission matrix D(ν, ν + 1) converts the coeﬃcients

in slab ν + 1 at z = hν to the coeﬃcients in slab ν at z = hν:

C (ν) = D(ν, ν + 1) C (ν+1).

(3.7)

Within a slab ν, one can also relate the ﬁelds at z = hν+1 to the ﬁelds at z = hν by

a diagonal propagation matrix,

Using the same parameters as reference [2], the quantum wells were represented

with a Drude model where ǫzz was imaginary and represented absorption.

By stringing together the transmission matrices and the propagation matrices,

we can relate the ﬁelds at one extreme of the stack to the ﬁelds at the other end of

17

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

T (1, N) = D(0, 1)

P (hν, hν+1) D(ν, ν + 1).

(3.9)

N −1

ν=1
Y

To use the transfer matrix, we need to know boundary conditions at one or both

ends of the stack. In our case, the incident light is given. Therefore we know the

coeﬃcients of the up-going modes in layer ν = 1. This forms one boundary condition.

Also, the top grating is completely reﬂecting so the upward and downward traveling

light at layer ν = N are related via a scattering matrix,

(3.12)

Using the scattering matrix in equation 3.10, I ﬁnd the down-going modes at layer

ν = N from the up-going modes. Using the transfer matrix, these modes can be

propagated to any layer in the structure.

The transfer matrix takes into account inﬁnite reﬂections and interference. This

is the main advantage of the method. However, the solutions of thick structures,
where hN −

maxm(Im{kz s,m}) , involve inverses that become unstable. Therefore,

h1 >>

the transfer-matrix method degrades as the structure being modeled becomes thicker

and higher order modes are considered.

3.2 Transmission matrices for the quantum-well

slabs

The ﬁrst type of transmission matrix we need is for the quantum-well slabs. The

interface is assumed smooth so the modes are not mixed; we need only consider

reﬂections and transmissions. The transmission matrix is given by

(3.13)

where rs and ts are the Fresnel reﬂection and transmission coﬃcients respectively

and s is an index which indicates if we want the TE or TM case.

In the case of anisotropic media, the Fresnel coeﬃcients need to be more carefully

deﬁned. The coeﬃcients are normally deﬁned in terms of a plane wave with the

electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane of incidence (TE), or a plane wave with the

electric ﬁeld parallel to the plane of incidence (TM). Also, the traditional deﬁnition

of the angle of incidence and angle of transmission is insuﬃcient in uniaxial media

because the dispersion relation relating kx, ky, and kz is diﬀerent for T E and T M

polarization.

To clarify, I present the dispersion relation for a uniaxial non-istropic material

in terms of the wave vector components. The dielectric constant is the same for the

ˆx and ˆy directions, denoted ǫk and diﬀerent for the ˆz direction, denoted ǫzz. Due

to the continuous translational symmetry parallel to the ﬂat interfaces of the layers,

3.3 Modes in the bulk structure

I am solving a problem involving gratings. A tutorial introduction to the methods of

solving diﬀraction grating problems is given by Petit in Ref. [26]. Grating periodicity

places limits on the modes that I can consider in the bulk. I approximate the periodic

grating to have an inﬁnite extent. For electromagnetic waves of frequency ω in the

presence of a linear grating, the ﬁelds must satisﬁes the quasi periodicity condition,

f (y) = f (y + d)exp(i ko y),

where ko is the component of the incident wave vector perpendicular to the grooves

of the grating. The ﬁelds can then be expressed as a sum of a discrete set of modes,

F (y, z) =

Cm,± exp(iαmy

Because each discrete symmetry ~dj is a two-dimensional vector, we cannot ﬁnd a set of

reciprical lattice vectors if there are more than two independent discrete symmetries.

Physically, more than two independent discrete symmetries will lead to an inﬁnitely

dense set of modes to consider.

In my structure, I need to have four or more gratings at four or more diﬀerent

orientations. However, if they are independent discrete symmetries, I will have an

inﬁnite number of modes to consider. To solve this problem, I constrain the discrete

symmetries to be linearly dependent. I limit my attention to cases where the period

and orientation of the four gratings form a repeating unit cell as shown in ﬁg. 3.3.

Each grating has one reciprocal lattice vector. Because our four gratings share a

repeating unit cell, the reciprocal lattice vectors kB and kD are formed by ∆kB(D) =

and where kh,o is an oﬀset momentum in the h direction set by the incident light.
To ﬁnd the modes, we make αb(αa) and β(αa) both functions of αa, and we scan αa

until we ﬁnd values where Det(M) = 0. Each of these values is a mode of the grating

and enumerated with the subscript m. For ǫa, ǫb

R, all αa

m will be either purely

∈

real or purely imaginary.

For γ = 0, the matrix M becomes block diagonal. Due to symmetry consider-

ations, the location of the zeros of Det(M) are independent of γ. Therefore, for

compuational simplicity, I found separately scanning the determinant of each γ = 0

submatrix was faster and more reliable than ﬁnding the zeros of the entire matrix

M in one scan.

For each zero we have one vector that spans the null space that satisfy eq. (3.41).

I have found that in only two cases is the null space multi-dimensional, and in both

cases the associated mode is trivial( Eg = 0 and Bg = 0) and should be omitted.

These null vectors can be found using the singular value decomposition.

Finding the zeros was a major hurdle in the process. Many curves are like parabo-

las that reach down and barely cross zero. These situations need to return the two

zeros or the resulting transfer matrix is singular.

faces

steps: Set up the boundary requirement in terms of the the ﬁelds F (ν)

and the

appropriate map (eqns. 3.28 - 3.31) from F to the vector ﬁelds of interest. Multiply

both sides of the equation by a list of complementary modes and integrating over a

unit cell. For example, the complimentary mode to exp(+iγg + iαmh) is exp(

A few ﬁnal notes. The modes in the grating need not be orthogonal because

they do not satisfy the Sturm Louiville conditions. I do not present the integrals

here because I performed them numerically in the C++ code. Currently, the pixel-

polarimeter model has about 20 design parameters and 20 parameters to describe

the physics of the constituent materials and the incident light.

3.7 Calibration and Measurement Uncertainty

Using this toolbox, the C++ code starts from a given incident polarization state,

calculates the coeﬃcients at layer ν = N, propagates these coeﬃcients to the regions

above and below each quantum-well stack, and calculates the energy lost in each of

the quantum-well stacks. The absorption by the quantum-well stack is proportional

to the energy lost across the stack. The photocurrent is proportional to the absorp-

tion. In this way, I can predict the photocurrent from any number of layers given

a pure, incident polarization state. The photocurrents representative of unpolarized

light are found by averaging the photocurrents from x-polarized light and y-polarized

light.

27

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

Because the Stokes vectors are a linear vector space, the response of an arbitrary

incident polarization state can be summarized in a polarization response matrix

(P RM). This matrix maps the four components of the incident light’s Stokes vector

Sin to the photocurrents R:

where the index j runs from 1 to the number of readouts NR. For full polarimetric
detection NR ≥

4 is required.

If NR > 4,the P RM represents an over-determined system. The pseudoinverse,

i.e. least squares ﬁt, gives the Stokes vector from the device readouts1. The Stokes

Conceptually, the uncertainty in δSj can be understood as the ability to distin-

guish two Stokes basis vectors (SBV ) on a two-dimensional readout vector space.

If the uncertainties in the two dimensions of the readout space are assumed to be

equal, δR = δR1 = δR2, then the 2

the Stokes basis vector SBVj as depicted in ﬁg. 3.5. The uncertainty in each Stokes

vector is found to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of that Stokes basis

vector and to the sine of the angle between that Stokes basis vector and the other

three Stokes basis vectors.

In order to relate the inherent polarization uncertainty factor Λj to a meaningful

polarization detection performance, I need to know the signal to noise ratio of our

quantum-well detectors. Using current QWIP cameras as a reference [24], each

quantum-well readout can detect changes in photocurrent larger than about 0.02%

of a room-temperature signal (this corresponds to an NE∆T of 9mK for a 300K

blackbody background). This gives us a signal-to-noise ratio SNR = R/δR = 5000

for the photocurrent from each quantum-well stack.

Using these ﬁgures, the normalized Stokes error is given by

δSj/S0 = Λj (δR/R) = Λj ×

0.0002

(3.59)

29

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

A typical signal of interest in the infrared is 2% to 5% linearly polarized. This means
that for a signal to noise ratio of 2, we need Λj ≤

100.

3.8 Results

I constructed a C++ code from these elements to model the behavior of the proposed

device. In this section, I will relate some of the results of the model indicating the

underlying physics and ways to improve performance.

3.8.1 Using Perfectly Conducting Gratings

The predicted response of a pixel-polarimeter at λ = 8.42 µm is shown in ﬁgs. 3.1 and

3.2. In both plots, the pixel-polarimeter that is modeled has 50 quantum wells each

with peak absorption at λQW = 8.42 µm, well width of 0.005µm and barrier width

of 0.03µm. The quantum well absorption was modeled with a Drude model, and the

Drude model parameters we used were taken from Anderson and Lundqvist’s paper

[1]. The gratings are structured with orientations as shown in ﬁg. 2.1. The gratings

at 45o and 135o have periods of 3.13 µm, and, due to the unit cell, the gratings at

0o and 90o have periods of √2

3.13 µm = 4.42649 µm. I refer to the period of the

gratings at 45o and 135o as the base period. All gratings have depths of 0.3 µm, and

·

duty cycles with GaAs for 0.7 of each period followed by a perfect conductor for 0.3

of the period. The contact layers above and below the gratings are 0.5 µm each.

Fig. 3.1 shows the linear-polarization responses of the four layers of the pixel

30

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

polarimeter. The relative response changes as the angle of the linearly-polarized

incident light varies. Fig. 3.2 shows the elliptical-polarization response of the four

layers of the pixel polarimeter. The relative response changes as we change the phase

lag between an x-polarized and a y-polarized plane wave. Notice that at phase lags of

0o and 180o the waves are linearly polarized with angles of 45o and 135o respectively.

To keep these scans representative of the scattering physics and independent of the

quantum-well design choices, we set the quantum-well peak-absorption wavelength

equal to the wavelength of the incident light.

In ﬁgs. 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8, we show the regions of parameter space with reasonable

polarization detection performance. The dark regions correspond to parameters for
a given incident wavelength where ΛWC ≤
QWIP noise and performance values, the device can detect DOP changes of 0.02.

100. In these regions for some reasonable

Fig. 3.6 shows how the polarization detection sensitivity changes as I vary the

wavelength and the base period of the four gratings. The responses from the four

layers shown in ﬁgs. 3.1 and 3.2 correspond to the parameters of the upper-left dark

region of ﬁg. 3.6.

The angled, dark streaks in ﬁgure 3.6 near 11 microns show a pattern that can

be exploited in designing a push-broom imaging spectral polarimeter. As one moves

along the focal plane of an imaging spectral polarimeter, the pixels detect diﬀerent

wavelengths.

If the focal plane is designed with a period that gets larger as the

wavelength gets larger, the resulting structure will allow near uniform polarization

sensitivity across a region of the spectrum.

Fig. 3.7 shows how the polarization detection sensitivity changes as I vary the

wavelength and the width of the dielectric grooves in all four gratings. In ﬁg. 3.7

the computer simulation becomes unstable for small groove widths and large wave-

lengths. Under these circumstances, not enough light penetrates through to the

31

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

deepest MQW stack to maintain a transfer matrix that can be meaningfully inverted.

Fig. 3.8 shows how the polarization detection sensitivity changes as I vary the

wavelength and the thickness of the contact layers above and below each MQW stack.

The device’s dependence on interference between the grating layers can be inferred

from ﬁg. 3.8. As you vary the contact layer thickness by δ you change the distance

between the gratings by 2δ and the round-trip path-length diﬀerence by 4 m δ where

m is a positive integer representing interference from layer m. The constructive

or destructive interference is caused by two paths for light with an optical phase

diﬀerence Φ that changes with δ and λ in the following manner:

Φ =

√ǫGaAs 2π
λ

4 m δ = n π

where n is an integer. The constructive or destructive interference can be maintained

if we change the contact layer thickness and the wavelength in such a way that Φ

is held constant. For constructive interference features, n is even. For destructive

interference features, n is odd.

In order to detect the polarization, interference

is needed from some round trips between gratings at diﬀerent orientations. Full

polarization detection requires interference from all four gratings.

We can compare the slope of the trends on ﬁg. 3.8 to Eq. (3.61) by solving for δ:

(3.61)

(3.62)

δ =

n
8 m √ǫGaAs

λ

In our code, √ǫGaAs = 3.28. For interference between the ﬁrst and fourth grating,

m = 3. For contact layer thickness around 0.5 µm the distance between gratings is

about 2.75 µm. Recall the grating depth is 0.3 µm. This means the actual distance

traversed across the four gratings is nearly 3.05µm

6. Because the wavelength of

10 µm radiation in GaAs is about 3 µm, the phase must advance about 6

2π during

the round trip across the four gratings. From the distance traversed, we determine

×

·

32

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

the choices of n to be n = 12 for constructive interference and n = 11 or 13 for

destructive interference. A choice of n = 13 and m = 3 gives a slope of 0.165. The

slope of the thin line near 10.5 µm and a contact thickness of 0.5µm is 0.166. This

analysis can be repeated for the other clearly deﬁned lines in ﬁg. 3.8 to discover which

interference paths dominate the polarization detection for the various wavelengths

and contact layer thicknesses.

3.8.2 Using Dielectric Gratings

The polarization sensitivity can be further improved by increasing the fraction of

light reaching the quantum wells deep inside the pixel. Again, to keep the scans

representative of the scattering physics and independent of the quantum-well de-

sign choices, as we change wavelengths, we set the quantum-well peak-absorption

wavelength equal to the wavelength of the incident light.

In ﬁg. 3.9, we plot the worst case polarization uncertainty factor for a sample

set of design parameters as a function of wavelength. Although not universal, the

dielectric grating device does have a generally lower uncertainty than the perfectly

conducting grating counterpart. For this particular scan, the gratings periods were

the same as the scans from ﬁgs. 3.1 and 3.2. The dielectric grating was formed by

rectangular strips of air.

The reason for the improved performance for a dielectric grating design is that

more light is able to propagate through the NR-layers of the pixel leading to a stronger

signal. In the case of perfectly conducting gratings, the stronger reﬂectivity causes

a very small fraction of the light to reach the deepest quantum wells.

33

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

3.9 Future modeling work

There are many improvements that can be done with the model. First, the code

is still very unstable. I cannot model structures with 5 or more layers because the

transfer matrices become singular. One way to avoid this problem is to re-write

the code with a scattering matrix approach. Another possibility is to use a ﬁnite

time domain (FTD) model. Although the structure is tall, the unit cell is small and

the solution should be possible in a resonable amount of time. This FTD approach

will be too slow for extended scans of the parameter space, but it could conﬁrm the

presented results.

The current code has several improvements possible. The code currently assumes

a real dielectric constant in the grating. In practice, the GaAs is n-doped and will

have some free carrier absorption. Incorporating a complex dielectric constant for the

grating would allow us to model these eﬀects. The modes used for all the calculations

in this section were the 3

3 set of modes shown in ﬁgure 3.3. I suspect the stability

×

would be improved if I used all modes that lie within a given radius. Last, the process

of ﬁnding the zeros of Det(M) can be improved dramatically. Currently, I sample

the curve at a ﬁne interval and search for when the function changes sign. I should

be scanning for the extrema of the curve and using these to bound the search region

when ﬁnding zeros.

With whatever code one chooses, there are also many tasks left to be solved. If

a focal-plane array for a grating spectrometer were to be constructed, the depth of

each grating would need to remain ﬁxed across the focal plane. However, something

must be varied so that the pixels will be optimized for the wavelength of the incident

light falling on that pixel. Figure 3.6 suggests the period could be a good choice to

vary.

Also, can the device be used in conjunction with a Fourier transform imager?

34

Chapter 3. Modeling the complete four-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

Would one need to know the P RM as a function of wavelength for each pixel? Will

this perform better than the grating spectrometer?

Last, one can always further scan or explore the 20-dimensional parameter space

to ﬁnd large islands of strong polarization sensitivity or parameters that are more
easy to fabricate. I am particularly interested in using NR ≥
demonstrated NR = 4. This will introduce an over determined system and average

5 layers, rather than the

out noise. A modeling study of this approach would be valuable.

Process design for a two-layer

polarimeter-in-a-pixel

The next formidable challenge was to ﬁnd a process that will allow fabrication of the

device. We begin with a proof-of-concept two-layer test structure. The purpose of

this structure is to demonstrate the underlying physics of the proposed device, and

to pave the path for fabricating the more complex four-layer structure.

The ﬁnal semiconductor structure is similar to the photonic crystal structures

built by Lin, Flemming, Yamamoto, Noda, [18, 35, 3]. Lin and Flemming used Si

and a pattern of etchings, regrowth, and chemical-mechanical-polishing. Aoki used

InP and micromanipulation move individual trays of periodic gratings onto a stack.

Yamamoto and Noda used GaAs and a pattern of etching gratings on separate wafers,

wafer-to-wafer bonding, and etching away the substrate.

The regrowth option is diﬃcult when one needs to grow quantum wells over a

grating[34]. Re-achieving planarization is even more challenging, and the resulting

quantum wells are of low quality which degrades their responsivity and the intersub-

band selection-rule critical for our application. The micromanipulation technique is

43

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

useful for fabricating gratings, but the technique is foreign to detector development,

and is not in wide spread use even among research organizations.

I anticipate that a wafer fusion approach will be more successful for building the

pixel-polarimeter. The quantum wells will each be grown on a perfect substrate and

then gratings will be etched and ﬁnally joined. The technique has been demonstrated

on GaAs, a favored material system for quantum-well devices and was ﬁrst developed

by Dr Liau’s group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, an Air Force FFRDC (Fedrally

Funded Research and Development Center) [17].

Because the test structure only has two layers, these pixels cannot detect the

full polarization state. The full polarization state requires four parameters. With a

two-layer structure we can measure at most two parameters per pixel. This means

that given two of the Stokes parameters, we should be able to measure the remaining

two.

In this chapter, I review the techniques on which I based my process for the device

fabrication. I will discuss the wafer fusion in more detail, substrate removal, and the

design of the mask set.

4.1 Process overview

The process I designed uses wafer fusion to bury quantum wells between two gratings.

We begin with a standard wafer with a thin (300 Angstrom) AlAs etch stop layer,

an n-doped contact layer, 50 repetitions of a quantum-well followed by a barrier, and

topped oﬀ with a second n-doped contact layer. We cleave the wafer into smaller

pieces. On both pieces, we grow Si3N4 to protect the surface. On the ﬁrst piece, we

etch gratings. On the second piece, we do not etch gratings. We then wafer fuse the

epilayers of the ﬁrst piece and the second piece together. Next, the substrate of the

44

second piece is removed by a selective wet chemical etch. The sacriﬁcial etch stop

layer is also removed. Now, gratings are etched into the stacked epilayers. We now

have two quantum-well stacks and two gratings stacked atop one another. After the

top grating, we deposit the n-metal for the top contact.

Now we isolate pixels. We etch the top mesa, and then with a slightly larger

mask, we etch the bottom mesa.

In order to make contact to the middle mesa,

we need to run a contact pad from the bottom of the tall pixel up a wall to the

middle layer of the tall pixel. We also need to insulate this middle contact pad from

the n-doped bottom surface. To insulate the middle contact pad from the bottom

surface, we deposit a layer of Si3N4. The Si3N4 coats all walls and surfaces of the

structure. Holes need to be opened in the Si3N4 to allow contact to the top of the

pixels, middle, and bottom of the pixel. In order to ensure electrical contact across

the interface, I make separate contact to a layer right above and right below the

fused interface.

have written a detailed list of the processing steps in appendix A. The remainder

of this section gives details and background on the constituent steps that form this

4.2 Wafer fusion overview

Wafer fusion and wafer bonding are techniques used to join two materials. Typically,

but not always, wafer bonding refers to the use of an adhesive or intermediate layer,

and wafer fusion refers to direct union of the two materials without an adhesive [21].

Wafer bonding is an older technique and will be skipped in this report. In addition

to direct fusion and bonding with an adhesive or intermediate layer, anodic bonding

is a third category of wafer fusion that makes use of an electric ﬁeld to encourage

the bonding process [28].

In 1986, Lasky ﬁrst reported wafer fusion to achieve a high quality Si crystal

over an insulator [15]. In 1990, Liau and Mull from MIT Lincoln Laboratories ﬁrst

reported wafer fusion in III-V semiconductors [17]. They reported bonding n-doped

and p-doped materials and demonstrating normal diode characteristics. Liau and

Mull also reported success on joining materials of diﬀerent lattice constants. All

their wafer fusion was done on samples with fused areas smaller than 4 cm2. Since

these seminal papers, many people have achieved wafer fusion with GaAs, InP, and

Si surfaces; these examples and studies will be addressed in the body of this chapter.

Wafer fusion is accomplished by ﬁrst cleaning and polishing each sample, placing

and aligning the two wafers together in an H2 environment, and then applying heat

46

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

and pressure to allow the bonds to break and reform across the interface.

The wafer surfaces to be fused need to be smooth and clean to enable wafer fusion

to take place. The surfaces can to have a local RMS roughness of no greater than

about 10 Angstroms, and the overall wafer surface must have bowing of less than 5

µm per 4 in wafer [28].

In some cases, one of the layers can be prepared with shallow channels to allow

liquid and gas bubbles to escape and improve the uniformity of the fused surface

[21]. Another alternative is to include gratings or other patterns that allow bubbles

to percolate to these collection points [17].

After the wafers are cleaned and joined, they are heated under pressure. The

device that performs this process is called a wafer fusion reactor.

The original paper by Liau et.al. on wafer fusion, used a wafer-fusion reactor

based on the diﬀering coeﬃcients of thermal expansion between graphite and quartz

[17]. A similar setup was used by ref. [36]. Others have found the pressure required

is not that large; conventional pressure source can also work. The setup used at

University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) is based on a half dome pressing the

two wafers together. The pressure source is tightening screws that hold the dome in

place. The dome is critical because it diminishes the dependence on tightening the

screws evenly [21].

Wafer fusion is facilitated by heat and uniform pressure. The pressure brings the

two surfaces into contact and eliminates air bubbles [28]. The heat allows the crystal

bonds to re-arrange and join the two surfaces. The wafer fusion reactor is designed

such that the two wafers experience nearly uniform pressure. The pressure used in

wafer fusion varies from 3 kPa to 3 MPa [5]. Higher pressure should allow fusion at

lower temperatures.

47

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

4.3 Substrate Removal Overview

One of the dominant reasons to use wafer fusion is to transfer the epitaxial layer of

one wafer onto the epitaxial layer of the second wafer. Once wafer fusion has been

performed, the substrate of one of the wafers needs to be removed [36, 21]. This

is facilitated by the use of a pregrown, thin, etch-stop layer on the substrate to be

removed.

One problem not clariﬁed in the literature is how to protect the back side. One

method that we considered was to spin photoresist on the back. Another possibility

is to mount the samples on a Si wafer or a glass slide with wax. As will be discussed

in the next chapter, the glass slide technique was found to be better.

To remove GaAs substrates, Zhu suggests jet etching with NH4OH-H2O2 solution

with a PH of 8.4. During jet etching, protect the wafer edges with wax to prevent

undercut. The etching will stop at any layer with AlxGa1−xAs (x > 0.6) or a lattice

matched InGaP layer. Both InGaP and AlGaAs etch stop layers can be removed

with HCl.

The GaAs vs AlAs selective etching technique which was best documented was

a citric acid : H2O2 etch [32, 13, 8]. Citric-acid monohydride is mixed 1:1 with

deionized water to form a citric-acid solution. The citric-acid solution is then mixed

with H2O2 at a ratio of 4:1 to form the etching solution. The solution has a selectivity

for etching GaAs over AlAs of over 1000 to 1.

As explained in the next chapter, we deduced a few missing details not mentioned

in the literature. The etch rate was not suﬃciently uniform to remove the entire 500

micron substrate with just the wet etch, so we needed to lap the substrate down to

100 microns. We also found the solution looses potency after a couple of hours so

the solution needed to be replaced several times during an etching procedure. The

48

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

end-point is easy to tell because the rough surface of the etched GaAs becomes a

smooth glass like surface when the etching reaches the AlAs. Last the etch-stop layer

should not be too thick because the AlAs forms a stressed oxide when exposed to

the solution [8]. The stressed oxide will crumble thin samples.

4.4 A map of the mask set

With these processes in mind, I designed the mask set using AutoCAD software.

Each die contains six pixels optimized to distinguish between two Stokes param-

eters given the other two Stokes parameters are known. Each die also contains a

number of diagnostic structures. The die is shown in ﬁgure 4.2.

Each two-layer pixel on the die allows us to make contact to the top, middle,

and bottom of the pixel with separate wire bonds. Figure 4.3 shows an SEM of the

contact pads to the three layers of the pixel from our ﬁrst round of fabrication. On

top of each pixel, we have a top contact pad. The ‘C’ shaped structure to the left of

the pixels is the middle layer’s contact pad. The middle contact pad has metal arms

that climb up to the mesa and make contact with the middle of the structure. The

long strips to the right of the column of pixels form a bottom contact pad. Each

contact pad is about 200 to 250 microns. The large size was to enable easy wire

bonding.

The right column contains pixels 1 through 5 which are each designed to be sensi-

tive to distinguish two polarization states. Pixel 8 on the left column is also designed

to distinguish polarization states. Table 4.1 lists the design parameters of these six

pixels and their intended polarization sensitivity. The next section explains how I

chose these design parameters and how sensitive the performance is to variations in

construction.

49

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

In practice, the fabrication process will probably not be able to guarantee the

design parameters to allow predictive design of the structure.

I expect that the

irregularities in the manufacture process will primarily shift the optimal wavelength

for the polarization sensitivity.

The left column contains mostly diagnostic devices. The top four horizontal bars

are mesas with small contact pads at varying distances from each other. I will refer

to these as ohmic contact probing mesas. There is one such horizontal mesa for each

depth that ohmic contacts are to form. These structures will allow us to measure

the quality of the ohmic contacts.

Below the ohmic contact probing mesas, two small squares side by side will test

the electrical behavior of the fused interface. The left square is just below the fused

interface; the right square will be just above the fused interface. Measuring the

resistance across these two pads will give some indication of the resistance across the

fused interface.

Pixels 6 and 7 are to test the quantum wells. If we have diﬃculty with the main

experiment (pixels 1-5 and 8), these two structures will allow us to test if the quantum

wells in either layer are working, and if so which layer is providing the photocurrent.

This could also be a useful way of measuring the amount of free-carrier absorption

in the doped region between the two quantum-well stacks. Pixel 6 has no gratings at

the fused interface, and a grating at the very top of the structure. Photocurrent can

be generated and measured across both sets of quantum-well stacks. Pixel 7 has had

the top quantum-well stack etched away and consists only of the lower quantum-well

stack and a grating on the same layer as the fused interface.

Pixel 9 is a copy of pixel 4 with one change. The gratings extend to the edge of

the mesa. There was no clear answer or reason that the gratings should be exposed

to the air or trapped in the semiconductor structure. This device explored this

50

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

variation. I also hoped this device would expose the fused gratings to facilitate good

SEM pictures.

Last, there are several large rectangles on the edge of the die. These are win-

dows to facilitate aligning the metal-ﬁeld masks. They were also intended as visible

alignment marks to be used in the ﬁrst alignment step after the substrate removal.

4.5 Choosing the grating design parameters

The computer model described earlier was modiﬁed to calculate the polarization sen-

sitivity of a two-layer structure. I scanned parameter space to ﬁnd parameters that

give reasonable performance and designed pixels on the mask to these speciﬁcations.

During this process, I encountered substantial instabilities in my computer code.

As I changed the angle between the gratings, energy conservation was oﬀ by more

than 100%. After weeks of debugging, I found the instability was due to my choice

of modes hard wired into the code. The code was relatively stable for gratings whose

angular separation is greater than 50 degrees. If I were able to choose modes that lie

within a ﬁxed radius, I expect this instability would be substantially more contained.

To account for this numerical instability, I added the numerical error to the

normalized Stokes error to create a total error measure. The numerical error was

estimated by the loss of energy conservation. To measure energy conservation with

my code (as written), I needed to assume a lossless contact layer (no free-carrier

absorption). The numerical error was added in quadrature to the inherent normalized

Stokes error. All plots shown in this section include both sources of error.

The decision to model without free-carrier absorption was found to be reasonable

in several ways. For parameters found to be stable, I noted that the free carrier

absorption lessened the signal by a small amount and shifted the wavelength of peak

51

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

polarimetric sensitivity. This suggested that the design parameters found with the

free-carrier absorption turned oﬀ would be good for detecting polarization at some

wavelength near the design wavelength, but not at the design wavelength. When I

say near, I mean within 0.1 microns of the 9 micron design wavelength.

Figure 4.4 shows a scan across the angular separation between the two gratings

while keeping all other grating parameters constant. Only normalized Stokes error

values less than one can be trusted to give a lab-observable polarization sensitivity

. The diﬀerent curves represent the ability to distinguish between two polarization

states, for example S1 and S2.

How closely does the fabrication process need to reproduce these design parame-

ters? Figure 4.5 provides us with some indication. In this ﬁgure, black means good

polarization sensitivity and white is unacceptable polarization sensitivity. For the

dielectric gratings in the top plot, the period must be speciﬁed to within 0.03 mi-

crons. The duty cycle (grating groove width / grating period) has more ﬂexibility.

The reﬂective grating parameters show much greater tolerance. The entire scanned

region of parameter space is acceptable. The performance appears to improve as we

move to shorter periods and smaller duty cycles. This rapidly becomes impossible

to fabricate due to very small feature sizes. I limited the feature sizes on the mask

set to 0.85 microns.

To choose these design parameters, I ran hundreds of scans on 10 computers

over the course of two weeks generating nearly 2 gigabytes of data. The results are

summarized in table 4.1.

During these scans, two classes of solutions become apparent. The ﬁrst class

involved both gratings diﬀracting incident light at angles in the range of 50 degrees

to 80 degrees.

The second class of solutions had one grating with a period such that the light

52

Chapter 4. Process design for a two-layer polarimeter-in-a-pixel

was diﬀracted to some angle in the range of 50 degrees to 80 degrees. The second

grating had a period so small that there were no diﬀracted orders. The grating’s

purpose was to create a bi-refringent layer to rotate the polarization state of light

diﬀracted by the ﬁrst grating.

Although both types of solutions displayed sensitivity similar to that summarized

in ﬁgure 4.5, the solutions where one grating was behaving purely like a birefringent

layer were much more tolerant to changes in the design parameters.

Lessons from the ﬁrst round of

The story of fabricating our two-layer test device reads like a Greek epic / trajedy.

Our heroes leave home for a long journey away from family to prove their worth, gain

fame and fortune, and bravely overcome nearly-insurmountable odds. They narrowly

escape near-certain destruction on many occasions. After months away on the long

voyage, they return home and tell the glorious stories of their battles to their friends

and family. Years later, their tales inspire the next generation of adventures to leave

the nest and brave uncharted waters.

In this chapter, I will describe the journey that we took to build a ﬁrst iteration

of a two-layer proof-of-concept device. I describe the several Achilles’ heels of the

proposed process, and I will give my suggestions to avoid these obstacles. I will also

describe the near-certain destruction that we found on other paths. After all, the

drama and intrigue of the story lie in the battles and challenges that we encountered.

At the end of this story, we ﬁnd the working device still not in our possession but

within sight. The reader is left with one burning question: Will there be a sequel?

59

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

5.1 The plan

During the time between November 2002 and February 2003, I was trying to isolate

some numerical instabilities in the computer model, and I was planning how to

fabricate the structure. The largest obstacle at the time was the wafer-fusion. The

University of New Mexico has not performed wafer fusion with GaAs and did not

have the facilities that the literature described for the process.

During October of 2002, I tried to collaborate with Prof. Noda from the Univer-

sity of Kyoto, but the international issues proved too complex. During November and

December of 2002, I tried collaborating with Sandia. Although this looked promis-

ing, my contact became too busy. In February of 2003, I established a collaboration

with MIT Lincoln Laboratory to do the wafer fusion.

The University of New Mexico would ship Dr. Liau at Lincoln Labs the sam-

ples to be fused, and they would ship them back fused. Dr Liau did request that

Si3N4 be deposited before performing any photolithography or etching to protect the

surface. UNM would perform the remainder of the processing including substrate

removal, etching the mesas, Si3N4 deposition, the metal contacts, and ﬁnally the

characterization.

The masks were designed by early March 2003. Processing was set to begin the

last week of March 2003. Purchasing paperwork delayed mask delivery until early

April. The original sample grown for this device was found unsatisfactory so a new

sample was grown in mid April. An FTIR test was performed that week to verify

the new QW structure. Sample processing began the last week of April.

The processing challenges described in this chapter continued to slow us down.

The wafers were shipped to MIT Lincoln laboratory on 6 May 2003.

The wafers were fused by 8 May 2003, but paper work to have them shipped

60

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

delayed their arrival until 15 May 2003. During that week, I debugged the substrate

removal process. By 19 May the substrate of the fused sample was removed, and we

began what we thought would be standard processing steps.

On 22 May, we discovered the diﬃculty with the wet etch for the mesa. Address-

ing this issue delayed us until the beginning of June. During June, we debugged the

Si3N4 etch and had a ﬁnalized sample wire bonded and ready to characterize on 10

Developing a characterization setup was done in parallel to the sample processing

during the months of May and June 2003. The polarimetric tools needed for char-

acterization were borrowed from Tom Caudill’s research group at AFRL/VS. The

characterization setup was tested on well-characterized QWIP structures with linear

law.

5.2 The quantum-well structure

Two wafers were grown for this device. The ﬁrst wafer was UNM 1374. Two QWIPs

were processed from this device. Each QWIP exhibited a short like behavior at 77

Kelvin. The dark current was in the range of a mAmp at 1 to 2 volts of bias. There

was no discernible photocurrent above this high dark current.

After comparing the structure of 1374 to structures designed at the Air Force

Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) by Dr. Dan Huang,

we noticed the quantum-well doping was signiﬁcantly higher in the 1374 sample. We

hypothesize that the Fermi-level was raised so high that the upper quantum well

state was largely occupied even at 77K. This would explain the ’short’ like behavior

We designed our next structure more closely to the validated designs used at

AFRL/VS. The main changes were to design the sample for 9 micron absorption

and to use a contact-layer doping of 1.75

doping. The 9 micron absorption was because this was the wavelength for which the

mask set was already designed. The reasoning to lower the doping was to mitigate

excess free-carrier absorption without sacriﬁcing the ability to form ohmic contacts.

The new structure is shown in ﬁgure 5.1.

To verify the quality of the new sample in a more timely manner than processing

a single-layer QWIP, we measured the sample’s absorption spectra with an FTIR at

Brewster’s angle. As can be seen in ﬁgure 5.2, the sample showed an absorption near

9 microns.

As will be described later in this chapter, our device did not form good ohmic

contacts. To test if this low doping level is the cause, I suggest processing a more

simple structure and verifying that ohmic contacts can be formed.

5.3 Etching the gratings

Patterning the photoresist for the gratings was much more diﬃcult than anticipated.

Per the suggestion of Beth Fuchs, we used AZ 5206 photoresist. Because we have

features just under one micron, the thin photoresist should be able to transfer the

pattern with greater ease. There were three main complications, an unknown process,

poor adhesion to the Si3N4, and a diﬀerent etch rate in the gratings due to transport

limitations in the ICP.

Figure 5.3: For a variety of conditions, despite using HMDS, the photoresist AZ5206
would loose adhesion to the GaAs or Si3N4 surface.

To this day the process for 5206 is still not well characterized by our group. We

began with exposures of 7.2 seconds and ended with exposures near 4.5 seconds. In

all cases we found similar problems. Either the photoresist that patterns the gratings

would loose adhesion leaving a spagetti like structure, or the developer would leave

a layer near the bottom of the grating grooves that blocked the ICP from etching a

grating at all. In all cases, we used HMDS. An example of loss of adhesion is shown

in ﬁgure 5.3. An example of the photoresist being barely patterned is shown in ﬁgure

5.4.

We did ﬁnd generally better behavior as we lowered the exposure time. Both

symptoms still occurred (sometimes on the same exposure), but with lower frequency.

We progressed by reworking the actual sample about 5 times until we had a yield

near 70% of the pixels.

The pixel quality could be judged quickly by the color at the lowest microscope

magniﬁcation. If all pixels were red, then without fail, the PR would be patterned

perfectly upon closer inspection. If the pixels were multicolored, we generally found

poor gratings upon inspection with higher magniﬁcations.

One possible suggestion is to try an anti-reﬂective coating (ARC) below the pho-

toresist.

The second major issue with the gratings is the etch rate. Using two data points,

we estimated the etch rate of the grating region using the CHTM ICP H2Anneal

recipe to be about 2400 Angstroms per minute and the etch rate through the Si3N4

to be 920 Angstroms per minute. However, the etch rate for mask GDS1 and GDS2

are diﬀerent because they have diﬀerent groove widths. The etch rate of the gratings

should be better characterized.

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

5.4 Removing the substrate

The task of removing the substrate required two practice rounds before we tried the

last set of adjustments on the actual device. As described in the previous chapter,

we used a 4:1 citric acid to H2O2 wet etch.

The etching was performed in a 1000 mL beaker with about 500 mL of etching

solution in the beaker. A magnetic stirring rod was used to improve the etch rate

and etch uniformity. The etch rate is in the range of 0.2 microns per min to 0.4

microns per min. This gives a total etch time of nearly 36 hours.

During the etching, I would remove the samples from the etching solution, rinse

and dry the samples, and measure their thickness with a micrometer.

Each time, before placing the samples in the etch solution, one should dip the

samples into a solution of 1:10 NH4OH to H2O to remove the surface oxide.

In

principle, this should improve the etch rate uniformity across the sample.

I ﬁrst practiced the etching on some samples mounted to glass slides with pho-

toresist.

I found the etch rate slowed with time. After 4 to 6 hours the etching

solution needed to be replaced. During the last 10 hours of the etch, the photoresist

broke free from the glass slide and the samples were etched away from both sides.

The next iteration involved mounting the sample to glass slides with melted

wax. This time I was testing two diﬀerent samples: a brag mirror with many 3000

Angstrom layers of AlAs, and a quantum-well structure with a single 300-Angstrom

etch-stop layer of AlAs. When the sample was less than 10 microns thick, the brag

mirror crumbled. I suspect the crumbling was due to the stress of the oxide formed

in the reaction with the AlAs layer[8].

On the quantum-well sample, I saw the rough surface turn into a mirror-like

surface over the course of four hours. The mirror-like surfaces would start as small

66

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

spots at random locations on the surface and grow. When the surface was 90 %

mirror-like, I removed it from solution. Visually the surface looked smooth with

small discolorations. An alpha step scan revealed that the etch stop layer had broken

through and the etching had again paused on the AlGaAs forming the barriers of

the quantum wells.

We needed to improve the etch rate uniformity or decrease the amount of wet

etching necessary to remove the substrate. Our solution was to lap 400 microns from

the substrate before performing the wet etch. With this additional step, we removed

the substrate trivially. The surface turned from rough to mirror-like in less than 5

minutes.

The substrate removal revealed a few indications of the wafer-fusion quality. The

substrate removal revealed that the windows buried between the two epilayers had

warped the epilayer above it into a 0.3 micron arroyo. Second, during a buﬀered

oxide etch (BOE) dip to remove the AlAs etch-stop layer, the epilayer above one

pixel popped oﬀ.

5.5 Etching the Si3N4

Three approaches were considered for etching the Si3N4. First was an ICP chlorine-

based etch. This etches GaAs twice as fast as the Si3N4. Although a small etch into

the GaAs would not be disastrous for the process, the combined uncertainties of our

etch rate in the ICP made this less desirable.

A second possibility is to use a BOE etch. I tried using a 90 second 1:20 BOE

etch on three occasions on practice wafers. On two occasion, the BOE etched the

large contact strips without diﬃculty, but did not etch the small 15 micron holes on

the middle mesa that are needed to make contact with this layer. The third occasion

67

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

will be discussed in the next paragraph.

The ﬁnal method considered was a Reactive Ion Etch (RIE) with CHF3. This

process worked beautifully on three trial samples. For a 100 watt plasma, and 100

mTorr of CHF3, the etch rate appeared to be more than 300 Angstroms per min.

When we placed our actual, oﬃcal sample in the RIE, we found the process was

etching more strongly on the edges near the mesa walls. Figure 5.5 shows the Si3N4

etched away to the walls. We believed the etching on these edges was due to residual

O2 attacking the number of sharp corners in the photoresist near this corner.

On the third re-work of this step, we tried purging the O2 from the RIE exensively.

During the conditioning runs, with the main O2 valve behind the RIE shut oﬀ, we

opened the O2 line in the RIE to evacuate the pipe of all O2. We also did a 30 minute

conditioning run. Before the etch, we performed 8 pump-and-purge cycles to remove

the atmospheric O2.

During the actual etch, we ran out of CHF3. Under a microscope, the etch

rate was observed to be highly non-uniform, but the edges near the mesa walls were

untouched. Because we did not have an option to get more CHF3 for several weeks,

we choose to ﬁnish the etch with a one-minute etch in 1:20 BOE. About 80% of the

Si3N4 appeared to have cleared, but about 20% was still a brown or blue color. After

much concern, we proceeded with the process for depositing the bottom and middle

contacts.

As we discuss later in this chapter, the device exhibited open-circuit behavior

on all devices. Si3N4 will form an insulating barrier for 5 volts with as little as 50

Angstroms [22]. For a thickness of 50 Angstroms, the Si3N4 will appear the same

color as the semiconductor. We could have a small layer of Si3N4 insulating our

substrate from our metal contacts.

To use O2 or not to use O2, that is the question. The Reactive Ion Etching (RIE)

68

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

of the Si3N4 was done with a CHF3 plasma. Other users use a small amount of O2

in the RIE plasma. The reason is the CHF3 etching process tends to leave behind
organic compounds 1. The small amount of O2 is intended to remove the organic

compounds from the surface. As shown in ﬁgure 5.5, adding O2 to the CHF3 during

the RIE etch will not work for our process. One possible solution is to ﬁrst perform

the CHF3 etch, then after purging the system and removing the photoresist, to do

an O2 plasma clean.

5.6 Driving metal up the mesa walls

The original plan was to use a wet etch for the bottom mesa. The reason was to

create a slopped side wall that would facilitate the metal climbing up the mesa wall

to make contact with the middle layer. The wet etch was supposed to be nearly

isotropic to make these slopped side walls.

We tried several variations of a wet etch in H3P O4 : H2O2 : H2O of concentration

1:1:45. We tried with and without a magnetic stirring rod and we tried a stronger

concentration of 1:1:15. The etch rate was very non-isotropic. The solution appeared

to be etching laterally a factor of 40 times faster than the etch rate downward.

Instead of the wet etch, we decided to do a straight wall ICP etch and mount the

sample in the metal evaporator at a small angle. The samples were mounted on the

rough side of a Si wafer and loaded at an angle of 5.5 degrees such that the wall that

the metal was going to climb was facing the oncoming particle ﬂux.

This technique has shown mixed success. Figure 5.6 shows our success in getting

the metal to climb the wall. However, on all three iterations that we tried this

1I would like to thank Capt Chris Morath at AFRL/SN and Dr. Gabriel Font-Rodriguez

at the US Air Force Academy for bringing this concern to my attention.

69

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

process, the lift-oﬀ procedure was diﬃcult. In two cases, the lift-oﬀ procedure also

removed metal that was intended to stick to the surface, and left metal where it was

suppose to be removed. On one iteration, the lift-oﬀ procedure completely removed

all the metal leaving nothing.

I think the cause for these complications is the metal-ﬂux angle is overshooting the

angle of the undercut of the photoresist. Metal lift-oﬀ is best performed with image

reversal photoresist. The image reversal leaves the photoresist with an undercut that

forces clean breaks in the metal deposited on the surface from the metal deposited

on the photoresist. If during the metal deposition, the sample is slopped at an angle

higher than the undercut, then the metal will climb up the photoresist walls and tie

the two layers together.

To verify that the angle was responsible for the diﬃculties, we processed other

samples in parallel with our sample. For the other samples that were loaded ﬂat in

the metal evaporator, the lift-oﬀ procedure was smooth and uneventful. The metal

was all lifted-oﬀ within about 2 minutes using the acetone spray brush. For the

polarimeter loaded at a 5.5 degree angle during the same run, lift-oﬀ involved more

than 30 minutes with the acetone spray brush. The resulting metal deposited was

partly a success but also had many regions of metal lifted-oﬀ that were suppose to

stay and many regions of the surface with metal that was suppose to be lifted oﬀ.

Adhesion to the Si3N4 was also considered a potential source of diﬃculty. On

the ﬁnal metal evaporator run with the oﬃcial sample, we tried using a 50 Angstrom

layer of titanium to improve the metal adhesion to Si3N4.

70

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

5.7 Wire bonding

Once the metal was annealed, we proceeded to wire bond the structure. The middle-

layer contact pads required care to bond to. If the wrong temperature was used, the

metal would rip from the Si3N4 insulating it from the bottom contact layer. Patience

was the key for bonding these structures.

The top contacts were more diﬃcult. Each time a wire bond was made to the

top surface, the bond would break loose, and the contacting metal surface would

disappear. Closer inspection with an SEM revealed the source of the diﬃculty.

Figure 5.7 shows one such example of a pixel where the attempt to bond to the top

contact failed. Every top-contact to which a traditional wire-bond was attempted

resulted in the failure of the fused interface. The wire bonds were adhering to the top

metal contact pads without diﬃculty, but they were breaking oﬀ the fused epilayer.

Sunil Raghavan was able to make contact to the pixels despite this complication.

The solution involved a conducting epoxy and can be seen in ﬁgure 4.3.

5.8 The failure of ohmic contacts

After the device was wire bonded, we tested the structure with a semiconductor

parameter analyzer. Every pair of contacts, including the ground to ground contacts,

showed an open behavior at room temperature with resistances greater than 1 giga

ohm. A typical QWIP device at room temperature has a resistance near 10 to 20

ohms.

Where we had multiple contacts on a single ground strip, we would get the

expected short like behavior with resistance less than 1 ohm. This veriﬁed the set-

up and wiring diagrams were correct. The resistance of a quantum-well structure

71

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

rises as one lowers the temperature.

To test the quality of the ohmic contacts, we used the ohmic contact probing

mesas. Probes were placed on the top contact probing mesa. The current did not

need to do anything diﬀerent from entering the n-doped layer and leaving the n-

doped layer 100 microns away. The resistance was still greater than a giga ohm.

Unfortunately the middle and bottom ohmic contact probing mesas did not have

any metal due to the diﬃculties during the metal lift-oﬀ procedure.

There are several possible causes for the failure to form ohmic contacts.

One possible cause is Si3N4 remained on the surface due to the diﬃculties we

had removing it. Si3N4 will form an insulating barrier for 5 volts with as little as 50

Angstroms [22]. For a thickness of 50 Angstroms, the Si3N4 will appear the same

color as the semiconductor. We could have a small layer of Si3N4 insulating our

substrate from our metal contacts.

Another possibility is the RIE etch left a small layer of organics on the surface

that is insulating the metal contacts from the n-doped surface. If this is the case,

no amount of CHF3 etching will remove this layer without use of some O2. Perhaps

after the Si3N4 etch with CHF3, a very pure O2 plasma will ensure the surface is

free of an organic insulator. Pure O2 plasma should not attack the Si3N4 so long as

there is no residual CHF3.

A third possibility is the 1.75

1018 cm−3 Si doping is not enough to form good

×

ohmic contacts. To evaluate this, we should process a much more simple structure

and evaluate the quality of the ohmic contacts.

72

Chapter 5. Lessons from the ﬁrst round of fabrication

5.9 Characterization setup

Also as a part of the project, at AFRL/VS, we validated an approach to characterize

the polarimeter. A wire grid polarizer was inserted in-between a monochometer and

the dewar window. A known QWIP sample with a linear grating was placed in

the dewar. We measured the photocurrent as a function of polarizer angle. This

experiment showed that the photocurrent was related to the angle of the polarizer

in complete agreement with theory.

5.10 Suggestions for future processing rounds

The good news: at the end of the ﬁrst round of processing, the physical structure

on the chips is the desired physical structure. Figures 4.3, 5.6 and 5.7 show two

quantum-well stacks and two gratings with one grating is buried in between the two

quantum-well stacks. This is itself a substantial accomplishment.

For the next round of processing, I have the following suggestions.

1. Test the quantum-wells and the contact layer of the wafer with a simple struc-

ture.

2. Characterize the photoresist AZ5206 better or try a diﬀerent photoresist. Some

suggested an anti-reﬂective coating could help.

3. Better characterize the etch rate of the gratings.

4. Test for residue left from the RIE etch of the Si3N4. Build a test structure with

an n-doped GaAs surface. Deposit Si3N4. Etch the Si3N4 holes, and deposit

metal. Test for conduction through the n-doped GaAs.

73

5. Test if the metal climbs the walls without the lift-oﬀ complications at a smaller

angle (3 degrees for example).

Conclusions

This thesis reported on a new optoelectronic device to detect, simultaneously and

instantaneously, the four parameters that fully describe the polarization state of an

ensemble of incident photons in a narrow wavelength band.

In chapter 1, I introduced the Stokes parameters as a way of fully describing the

polarization state of incident light. I also introduced polarimetric imaging, and I re-

viewed other techniques for capturing polarimetric images. Other techniques involve

large errors at the edges of objects in the scene or require the designer to sacriﬁce

spectral resolution or increase the weight by using beam splitters and multiple focal

plane arrays.

Chapter 2 introduced my solution to this diﬃculty. The new device uses the

interference between multiple diﬀractions and reﬂections in the structure to encode

in the multiple photocurrents the polarimetric information.

A computer model, developed in chapter 3, demonstrates the device’s prelimi-

nary polarimetric capabilities. The chapter describes the methodology of the model,

reviews data generated by the model, and analyzes the data to gather worst-case

77

Chapter 6. Conclusions

performance estimates.

Finally, in chapters 4 and 5, I explain our approach and progress in building

the device. These sections reviewed the overall approach, the wafer-fusion process,

the substrate removal process, and recounted the diﬃculties we had in building

the device: the diﬃculty with etching the gratings, the diﬃculties with etching the

Si3N4, and the diﬃculty with the metal lift-oﬀ. The ﬁnal product did not have ohmic

contacts into the device. I also listed a few possible explanations for this failure: an

insulator was left on the surface or the contact layer’s doping is too low. Appendix

A will enumerate the detailed processing recipe that I suggest for future fabrication

attempts.

The polarimeter-in-a-pixel will be a totally new type of optoelectronic sensor.

This is the ﬁrst sensor that detects all the polarization information on a single phys-

ical pixel. The ﬁrst round of fabrication brought into focus many hurdles that we

overcame in building the physical structure. I expect that after solving the problem

with the ohmic contacts, the concept for the device will be successfully validated.

DI water (to remove isopropanol residue). Dip into 1:5 HF for 30 seconds to

remove native oxides formed, then a 5-minute soak in running DI water to

remove the HF and allow safe handling of the wafer. Now a 20 second dip in

1:30 NH4OH : H2O. Immediately blow dry (removes last of oxides) and place

in PECVD vacuum in less than 10 minutes to beat oxide re-growth.

PECVD: Deposit 2000 Angstroms of Si3N4 oxide on both wafers to protect the

clean surface. Use a surface temperature = 300 C, an operating pressure of

500 mTorr, use N2 ﬂow = 85 sccm, NH3 ﬂow = 12 sccm, SiH4 ﬂow = 65 sccm,

RF Power = 55 watts. It should take about 17 minutes for 2000 Angstroms to

grow. Let the sample cool to 150 C before removing from the chamber.

2. Photolithography (this step is still producing a 70% pixel yield, and needs to

be further reﬁned). Only one of the two wafers needs this photolithography.

Clean the Si3N4 surface. Note humidity and temperature. Again a 5-minute

acetone soak and an acetone spray brush (to remove organics). Swirl the ace-

tone constantly. Next, a 5-minute isopropanol soak (to remove acetone), again

swirling constantly. Now a 5-minute soak in running DI water (to remove

isopropanol residue). Blow dry the sample.

Dehydration Bake: 150 C for 7 min. Cover surface with HMDS, spin at 5k for

30 seconds. Bake on hotplate 150 C for 30 seconds. Add positive PR AZ 5206

to the wafer. Beth recommended this PR because it produces a more thin coat

to get sharp grating features. Spin at 5k, 30 seconds. Check for photoresist

that climbed over edge onto bottom. If found, restart step 2.

Softbake 90 C for 90 seconds. Remove edge beads (optional). If you do remove

edge beads, use the edge bead removal mask. Expose between 3.5 and 5.7

seconds. Develop for 80 seconds in 1:5 AZ400 developer. Use the Dielectric-

Grating mask (a negative mask) located on GDS-1. See ﬁgure A.1 for more

mask location.

Appendix A. Suggested processing recipe

3. ICP Etch of the dielectric grating through the Si3N4.

We need a reproducible etch depth known depth to within 0.02 microns. Our

two-point calibration showed that using the H2Aneal recipe the etch rate in

Si3N4 is 926 Angstroms per min. For 2000 Angstroms, the etch time is 2.1587

min. After etching the Si3N4 one needs to etch the GaAs. The etch rate is

about 2410 Angstroms per min. With a desired depth of 8800 Angstroms, the

etch time is an additional 3.65 min.

Total etch time is 5.81 min = 5 min 49 seconds.

Next we remove the photoresist with an acetone spray brush, followed by stan-

dard cleaning.

Standard cleaning is a 5-minute acetone soak and spray (to remove organics).

Next a 5-minute isopropanol soak (to remove acetone). Now a 5-minute soak

in running DI water (to remove isopropanol residue). Blow dry.

You will probably need to use an O2 plasma to remove the remaining photoresist

from surface. After the O2 plasma, repeat the above cleaning procedure with

soaks in acetone, IPA, DI water, and blow dry.

4. Wafer fuse the samples.

In the case of this thesis, we shipped the samples to Lincoln Lab Attention Dr.

He is doing this as a ﬁrst-time small eﬀort favor, and will probably not be able

to perform wafer fusion on a regular basis without some funding support.

Wafer Fusion begins with removing Si3N4 protective layer with BOE wet etch.

19. RIE Selective Etch of Si3N4.

First clear out the O2 in the pipe. Bring the RIE to about 10 mTorr. Now

make sure the O2 valve behind the RIE is closed, and turn on the O2 switch

on the RIE. Wait till the pressure returns to about 10 mTorr. Now close the

O2 swith on the RIE and perform a long conditioning run with CHF3. About

100 watts with about 100 mTorr pressure. 30 minutes should be enough. Now

load the sample. Do eight pump-and-purge cycles to remove any O2 from the

atmosphere in the chamber. Now do the CHF3 etch for 9 minutes with the

same settings as the conditioning run.

Now remove the photoresist with acetone spray brush followed by a standard

clean.

Next do an O2 clean. Again do an extensive purge of the system to remove

any CHF3 in the chamber. Clear out the CHF3 pipe just as we cleared out

the O2 pipe in the previous paragraph. Do a 30 minute conditioning run. Now

load the sample, do 4 pump-and-purge cycles, and do a 5 minute O2 plasma

clean. The O2 plasma (if free of any CHF3) should not attack the Si3N4 and

will remove only the organics left on the surface.

Pixel Detectors

Abstract

Pixel detectors for precise particle tracking in high
energy physics have been developed to a level of ma-
turity during the past decade. Three of the LHC de-
tectors will use vertex detectors close to the inter-
action point based on the hybrid pixel technology
which can be considered the ‘state of the art‘ in this
ﬁeld of instrumentation. A development period of al-
most 10 years has resulted in pixel detector modules
which can stand the extreme rate and timing require-
ments as well as the very harsh radiation environment
at the LHC without severe compromises in perfor-
mance. From these developments a number of dif-
ferent applications have spun off, most notably for
biomedical imaging. Beyond hybrid pixels, a num-
ber of monolithic or semi-monolithic developments,
which do not require complicated hybridization but
come as single sensor/IC entities, have appeared and
are currently developed to greater maturity. Most ad-
vanced in terms of maturity are so called CMOS ac-
tive pixels and DEPFET pixels. The present state in
the construction of the hybrid pixel detectors for the
LHC experiments together with some hybrid pixel
detector spin-off is reviewed. In addition, new devel-
opments in monolithic or semi-monolithic pixel de-
vices are summarized.

I. HYBRID PIXEL DETECTORS FOR THE LHC

EXPERIMENTS

The truly challenging requirements on detectors
operation close to the interaction points at the LHC
are on spatial resolution, on timing precision, and
most importantly on the long term operation perfor-

mance and radiation tolerance to particle ﬂuences
as high as 1015neq/cm−2. At present, these demands
are only met by so-called hybrid pixel detectors, for
which the particle sensing element, the sensor, and
the integrated electronics circuitry, the readout chip,
are separate entities. They are mated by a hybridiza-
tion technique, known as bump and ﬂip-chip tech-
nology. All of the LHC-collider-detectors ALICE
[1,2], ATLAS [3,4], and CMS [5,6], LHCb (for the
RICH system) [7] at the LHC, and the CERN ﬁxed
target experiment NA60 [8], employ the hybrid pixel
technique to build large scale (up to ∼2m2) pixel de-
tectors. Pixel area sizes are typically 50 × 400 µm2
as for ATLAS or 100 × 150 µm2 as for CMS. The
detectors are arranged in cylindrical barrels of 2 to 3
layers and disks covering the forward and backward
regions.

A. The sensors

The discovery that oxygenated silicon is more ra-
diation hard, with respect to the non-ionizing energy
loss of protons and pions [9] than standard silicon,
allows operation of pixel detectors at the LHC for
which the radiation is most severe due to their prox-
imity to the interaction point. Sensors with n+ elec-
trodes in n-bulk material have been chosen to cope
with the fact that type inversion occurs after about
Φeq = 2 × 1012cm−2. After type inversion to p-type
bulk material the pn-diode sits on the electrode side,
from which the depletion zone develops into the bulk,
thus allowing the sensor to be operated partially de-
pleted. For the Super-LHC, a name termed for an
LHC-upgrade programme which targets a luminos-
ity of 1035cm−2s−1 and hence scales the environment
at the LHC by a factor ten in all aspects, new sensor
technologies are needed to cope with the radiation
hardness demands. Figures 1(a) and (b) show pho-
tographs of the sensor wafers of ATLAS and CMS,
respectively, which both use oxygenated silicon as the
sensor material.

B. The FE electronics

The challenge in the design of the front-end pixel
electronics [10] can be summarized by the follow-
ing requirements: low power (. 50µW per pixel),
low noise and threshold dispersion (together . 200e),
zero suppression in every pixel, on-chip hit buffer-
ing, and small time-walk to be able to assign the hits
to their respective LHC bunch crossing. The pixel
groups at the LHC have reached these goals in sev-
eral design iterations using ﬁrst radiation-soft pro-
totypes, then dedicated radhard designs, and ﬁnally
using deep submicron technologies. For ATLAS the
full production quantity of chip wafers has been pro-
cessed and tested with an average yield of 82%. CMS
yields are in the same order and ALICE chip yields
are 51% with a chip area of 13.5 × 15.8 mm2. While
CMS uses analog readout of hits, ATLAS obtains
pulse height information by means of measuring the
time over threshold (ToT) for every hit. Figure 2(a)
shows the distribution of measured thresholds of an
ATLAS front-end chip. The dispersion of about 600

e− can be lowered to below 50 e− by a 7-bit tuning
feature implemented in the chip. Figure 2(b) illus-
trates the effect of time walk for small signals. For
efﬁcient signal detection within a deﬁned time of 20
ns with respect to the bunch crossing an overdrive of
about 1200e− is necessary. The bunch crossing oc-
curs every 25 ns.

The hit information is extracted as follows: A 40
MHz Gray coded clock is transmitted to all pixel
cells. If the pixel circuit detects a hit signal (analog)
it generates digital hit information. The hit data (ad-
dress and time stamp) are transmitted to the bottom
of the chip and temporarily stored in end of column
buffers outside pixel matrix. The buffers monitor the
age of each hit data and delete hits when no trigger
coincidence occurs. Hits having their time stamp co-
incident with the LV1 trigger are ﬁnally read out.

C. Hybridization

Figure 3. (a) solder (PbSn, Photo IZM, Berlin) (b) Indium (Photo
AMS, Rome), and (c) Indium with reﬂow (Photo PSI, Villigen) bump
rows with 50µm pitch.

Figure 4. SEM cross section (IZM, Berlin) of a bumped ATLAS
assembly with the sensor on the top and the FE-chip on the bottom.

Hybridization of chip and sensor is done by ﬁne
pitch bumping and subsequent ﬂip-chipping, either
with PbSn (solder) or with Indium bumps. The In-
dium bumps are applied by a wet lift-off technique
and can be mated by direct thermo-compression
[11,12] or reﬂown, as developed by CMS [13]. After
bumping the chips are thinned by backside grinding
to a thickness of 150 - 180 µm. Fig. 4 shows rows
of 50µm pitch bumps obtained by these techniques.
All of these bump bonding technologies have been
successfully used with 8” IC-wafers and 4” sensor
wafers.

ATLAS pixel modules are hybridized by two ven-
dors (one using indium one solder) at a rate of about
up to 2 × 20 per week. The fraction of broken, bridged
or missing bumps is at the level of 10−4. Above 85%
of all modules have less than 0.1% of bad bumps.
About 10-15% of the modules arriving from the ven-
dor have a chip with an unacceptably high number of
bump failures and need to be reworked, i.e. remov-
ing the FE-chip from the module and ﬂip-chipping of
a new one. The success fraction of this operation is
99% for solder and 80% for indium, mostly due to the
fact that In-bumps are ﬂatter and remnants of dirt in
the reworking process do more harm. The total reject
fraction of modules to date is 1% and 14% [14] for
PbSn- and Indium bumped modules, respectively.

D. The modules

The CMS and ATLAS modules (cf Fig. 5(a)) typ-
ically have 2 cm × 6.5 cm area consisting of 16 FE-
chips bump-connected to one silicon sensor.The I/O
lines of the chips are connected via wire bonds to
a kapton ﬂex circuit glued atop the sensor. The ﬂex
houses a module control chip responsible for front
end time/trigger control as well as event building. The
total thickness at normal incidence is in excess of
2.5% X0. The modules are arranged in barrel-ladders
or disk-sectors as shown in Fig. 5(b) for the case of
ATLAS.

Production pixel modules are scrutinized by exten-
sive tests in the lab, among them their analog and dig-
ital functionality, noise and threshold performance,
response to an X-ray source scan, as well as temper-
ature cycling of modules and also of assembled lad-
ders. For ATLAS modules, after tuning the threshold
spread is well below 100e− and the mean value of the
noise distribution is between 150e− and 200e− (cf.
Fig. 6). The quadratic sum of both is many sigmas
away from the typical threshold setting of 3000e−
or above, a requirement at LHC in order to keep the
noise hit occupancy low. In order to qualify the mod-
ules for their placement inside the ATLAS pixel de-
tector arrangement, a ranking factor based on pixel
efﬁciency, sensor quality, noise and threshold perfor-
mance, and rework penalty is introduced and a cut is
placed to qualify the modules as barrel layer B, 1, or 2
or as disk modules. Based on a sample of about 1300
modules to date 54% of the produced modules meet
the most demanding qualiﬁcation as B-layer mod-
ules. Finally, complete ladders of 13 module undergo
a so-called system test, i.e. a test procedure involv-

readout chips. (b) ATLAS modules mounted to a bi-stave unit and to

ing the complete readout chain of ATLAS, includ-
ing micro-cables, conversion into optical signal and
clock transmission and their routing over the full ca-
ble length in ATLAS. Comparison to module stand-
alone tests show no signiﬁcant chances in the perfor-
mance.

E. Radiation tolerance

Most challenging at LHC is the requirement on
radiation tolerance of the pixel detector which is ex-
posed to (mostly) pion ﬂuences of 1015 neq/cm2 or
500 kGy during 10 years of LHC operation. The ad-
vancement of oxygenated silicon and deep submicron
chip technology made a long life time in such an en-
vironment possible. Figures 7(a)-(c) show the com-
parison of critical performance ﬁgures before and af-
ter irradiation of ATLAS pixel modules. In parts the
received dose of the modules was well in excess of
that expected for 10 years operation at the LHC. Af-
ter irradiation to 500 kGy the mean collected charge
fraction has been measured to be ∼80% and the in-
time efﬁciency, i.e. the efﬁciency for hit detection
within 20ns after the bunch crossing, is 97.8±0.1%.

Figure 6. Threshold (top) and noise (bottom) distributions and maps
of ATLAS production modules.

An important characterization ﬁgure is the in-time
efﬁciency, which in test beams, at which the arrival
of the beam particles is asynchronous to the system
clock, can be determined by plotting the hit efﬁciency
as a function of the delay between the arrival time
and the clock edge, measured by a TDC. It is manda-
tory that a high efﬁciency is reached somewhere in-
side a plateau. The width and ﬂatness of the plateau
is a measure of some kind of margin that exists. The
plateau width decreases after irradiation from origi-
nally 14 ns to 9.7 ns. Figure 8 shows a comparison
between irradiated and not irradiated pixel sensors
regarding the amount of trapping. By measuring the
charge collection efﬁciency under inclined angles dif-
ferent depths for the charge deposition in the sensor
can be addressed and hence trapping can be studied

track density (∼80 hits/cm2) with 8000 charged par-
ticles per rapidity interval for central heavy ion colli-
sions is truly formidable, the radiation level of 5 kGy
or 6×1012neq/cm2, due to the much lower collision
rate, is much lower than for pp collisions. As a con-
sequence cooling to temperatures below 0◦C as for
CMS and ATLAS is not mandatory, but instead very
thin materials for a small total radiation length are
aimed for. The reduced cooling requirement (24◦ C)
allows the use of a very light weight structure with
40µm wall thickness PHYNOX tubes and a total con-
tribution of 0.3%X0. Together with thin sensors (200
µm) and chips (150 µm) an ALICE module (1.28 cm
× 7.0 cm, 5 readout chips bonded to one sensor) ar-
rives at a total radiation length per layer of only 0.9%.

the track traversing the detector.

irradiation to doses up to 100 Mrad. Hit map, noise and threshold
dispersions (top), spatial resolution in the 50 µm direction of the
pixels at 10o incidence angle (center), and the hit efﬁciency (bottom).
The in-time efﬁciency of a hit to be earlier than 25 ns is determined
in test beams relative to a ﬁxed delay of the trigger counters. The
highest point of the plateau shows the in-time efﬁciency. The width
of the plateau characterizes the available margin during operation.

as shown by Fig. 8. After 10 years at the LHC the
charge collection efﬁciency is about 80%. The charge
yield as a function of depth can be translated into an
electron carrier life time of τ = 4.1± 0.6 ns.

F. Support structures and total thickness

For ALICE the demands imposed by the physics
are different than for ATLAS and CMS. While the

II. SPIN-OFF FROM HYBRID PIXEL DETEC-

TORS INTO OTHER FIELDS

The CERN heavy ion experiment NA60 [15] has
used LHC-type pixel detectors for the ﬁrst time in
a running experiment. The setup of the NA60 pixel
tracker is shown in Fig. 10 (top). For the initial run-
ning the ALICE-LHCb chip was used. Eight 4-chip
(Fig. 10(bottom left)) and eight 8-chip planes pro-
vide track reconstruction with 12 pixel hits on a track.
The sensors have been exposed to a radiation dose of
120 kGy and were operated through type inversion.
Due to the inhomogeneous irradiation the inner part
of the planes has received a larger dose than the outer,
which is demonstrated by the hit multiplicity pattern
taken with a lowered bias voltage in Fig. 10(bottom
right). The improvement in physics from the oper-
ation of the pixel vertex detector has been reported
in [15]. The Indium target position can be resolved
to 20µm in the direction transverse to the beam and
200µm in the longitudinal direction. The meson reso-
nances ρ and ω could be detected with a resolution of
23 MeV in the di-muon invariant mass. In 2005, data
for p-nucleus running at a beam intensity of 2×109
p/burst and an interaction rate of one per 25 ns has
been taken. In order to cope with such LHC-like data
rates, four planes using ATLAS production modules
were added to the setup.

Figure 10. Pixel detector tracker in the NA60 experiment (top) con-
sisting in total of 16 track hit planes, four of these using ATLAS
production modules. The pixel planes(bottom left) were operated
through partial type-inversion, with the results demonstrated in the
hit-multiplicity plot (bottom right).

A. X-ray imaging using counting pixel detectors

Spin-off from hybrid pixel detectors in particle
physics has most directly arisen in imaging applica-
tions as detectors that accumulate the incident radi-
ation by the counting of individual radiation quanta
in every pixel cell. This technique offers many fea-
tures which are very attractive for X-ray imaging: full
linearity in the response function, in principle an in-
ﬁnite dynamic range, optimal exposure times and a
good image contrast compared to conventional ﬁlm-
foil based radiography, thus avoiding over- and under-
exposed images. The analog part of the pixel elec-
tronics is in parts close to identical to the one for LHC
pixel detectors while the periphery has been replaced
by counting circuitry [16]. The same principle is also
used for protein-crystallography with synchrotron ra-
diation [17,18].

The challenges which are to be addressed in order
to be competitive with integrating systems are: high
speed (> 1 MHz) counting with a range of at least 15
bits, operation with very little dead time, low noise
and particularly low threshold operation with small
threshold dispersion values. In particular, the last item
is important in order to allow homogeneous imaging
of soft X-rays of energies in the energy range below
10 keV. It is also mandatory for a differential energy
measurement, realized so far as a double threshold
with energy windowing logic [19,20,21], which can
enhance the contrast of an image as the shape of the
X-ray energy spectrum is different behind different
absorbers (e.g. bone or soft tissue). Finally, for radio-
graphy, high photon absorption efﬁciency is manda-
tory, requiring the use and development of high-Z
sensors and their hybridization.

The MEDIPIX collaboration [21] uses the MEDI-
PIX2 chip with 256 × 256, 55×55 µm2 pixels fab-
ricated in a 0.25µm technology, energy windowing
via two tunable discriminator thresholds, and a 13
bit counter. The maximum count rate per pixel is
about 1 MHz. Fig. 11(a) a single chip module to-
gether with an image of a bee taken using 14 keV
X-rays [21]. A Multi-Chip module with 2x2 chips
using high-Z CdTe sensors is shown in Fig. 11(b)
using the MPEC chip [22], together with two X-ray
images. The MPEC chip features 32 × 32 pixels
(200×200µm2), double threshold operation, 18-bit
counting at ∼1 MHz per pixel as well as low noise

tained by delicate threshold tuning (cf Fig. 12(b)).
Fig. 12(c) shows a ﬂat-ﬁeld image obtained with a
PILATUS module, which demonstrates that this prin-
ciple problem can be overcome [27]. Figure 12(d),
shows some Bragg spots obtained with a 10s expo-
sure to 12 keV synchrotron X-rays [28]. Some spots
are contained in only one pixel, others spread over a
few pixels due to charge sharing. This demonstrates
the intrinsically good point resolution of the system.
Figure 12(e) is a reconstructed electron density map
of the thaumtin crystal [27]. Alternative develop-
ments which aim to improve the active/inactive area
ratio for protein-crystallography X-ray detection are
so-called 3-D silicon sensors (strip or pixels) [29]. A
detailed account can be found in [30].

III. CHALLENGES IMPOSED BY A SUPER-

LHC

The radiation levels expected at an LHC upgrade,
called Super-LHC or SLHC, are a factor of ten higher
than at the LHC, i.e. to 1016neq/cm2. There are mainly
three effects as a consequence [31].

1. A change of the effective doping concentra-
tion (higher depletion voltage necessary, under-
depletion)

2. An increase of leakage current (increase of shot

noise, thermal runaway)

3. An increase of charge carrier trapping (loss of

charge)

Several routes to cope with this are being pursued,
among them the development of even more radiation
hard silicon based on oxygenated ﬂoat-zone (DOFZ),
Czochralski (Cz) and epitaxial silicon [31]. For this
review I would like to address in this context two new
approaches which are more linked to pixel detectors:
diamond pixel detectors and 3D-silicon devices.

A. Diamond Pixels

CVD-Diamond as a sensor material has been de-
veloped by the CERN R&D group RD42 for many
years [32]. Charge collection distances approaching
300 µm has also triggered the development of a hy-
brid pixel detector using diamond as sensors [33,34].
The non-uniform ﬁeld distribution inside CVD-
diamond, which originates from the grain structure in
the charge collecting bulk (cf. Fig. 14(a)) introduces
polarization ﬁelds inside the sensor due to charge

55×55µm pixel size) with Si sensor [21] (top) and an image of a bee

values (∼120e with CdTe sensor) and threshold dis-
persion (21e after tuning) [23,22]. A technical issue
here is the bumping of individual die CdTe sensors
which has been solved using Au-stud bumping with
Indium-ﬁlling [24].

B. Counting pixels in protein crystallography

In protein crystallography with synchrotron radia-
tion [17] the challenge is to image many thousands of
Bragg spots from X-ray photons with energies of ∼12
keV (corresponding to resolutions at the 1 ˚A range)
or higher, scattering off protein crystals. This must be
accomplished at a high rate (∼1-1.5 MHz/pixel) and
by systems with a high dynamic range. The typical
spot size of a diffraction maximum is 100 − 200µm,
calling for pixel sizes in the order of 100 − 300µm.
The high linearity of the hit counting method and
the absence of so-called ”blooming effects”, i.e. the
response of non-hit pixels in the close neighborhood
of a Bragg spot, makes counting pixel detectors very
appealing for protein crystallography experiments.
Counting pixel developments are made for the ESRF
(Grenoble, France) [25] and the SLS (Swiss Light
Source at the Paul-Scherrer Institute, Switzerland)
beam lines. A photograph of the PILATUS 1M de-
tector [26] at the SLS (∼ 106 217µm×217µm pixels,
18 modules, 20×24 cm2 area) is shown in Fig. 12(a).
A systematic limitation and difﬁculty is the problem
that homogeneous hit/count responses in all pixels,
also for hits at the pixel boundaries or between pixels
where charge sharing plays a role must be main-

Figure 13. (a) Single chip diamond pixel module using ATLAS

radioactive source (22 keV γ), (c) scatter plot of position correlation
between the diamond pixel detector and a reference beam telescope,
and (d) measured Landau distribution in a CVD-diamond pixel de-
tector.

ATLAS front-end chips have been built and tested.
Figure 13(a) and (b) show the diamond pixel detector
and a hit response pattern obtained by exposing the
detector to a 109Cd source of 22 keV γ rays, which
deposits approximately 1/4 of the charge of a mini-
mum ionizing particle. The single chip module has
been tested in a high energy (180 GeV) pion beam
at CERN, the module in a ∼4 GeV electron beam at
DESY. Figure 13(c) and (d) show position correla-
tion and the charge distribution of the diamond pixel
detector in a high energy beam, respectively. A spa-
tial resolution of σ = 12µm has been measured with
the single chip module at high energies with 50µm
pixel pitch. A technical challenge to produce a wafer
scale module lies in the hybridization process, i.e.
bump deposition and ﬂip-chipping. Figure 14 shows
the 16-chip diamond module (Fig. 14(b)) and its
tuned threshold map (Fig. 14(c)) with a very small
dispersion of only 25e− and good bump yield homo-
geneity. One chip was damaged during test beam by
electrostatic discharge. The rms of the position resid-
uals was measured to 24 µm in the DESY 6 GeV
beam [34]. This value is dominated by the multiple
scattering contribution from the beam telescope.

Bragg spots of an image taken with PILATUS 1M [28] are often

trapping at the grain boundaries which superimpose
on the biasing electric ﬁeld. This results in position
dependent systematic shifts in the track reconstruc-
tion with a typical average grain size of 100µm -
150µm [35]. Diamond sensors with charge collection
distances in excess of 300µm have been fabricated
and tested [36]. Single chip pixel modules as well as a
full size wafer scale 16-chip module assembled using

the bulk parallel to the detector surface over a short
drift distance of typically 50µm. Another feature is
the fact that the edge of the sensor can be a collec-
tion electrode itself thus extending the active area of
the sensor to within few µm to the edge. Edge elec-
trodes also avoid inhomogeneous ﬁelds and surface
leakage currents which usually occur due to chips
and cracks at the sensor edges. The main advantages
of 3D-silicon detectors, however come from a dif-
ferent way of charge collection and the fact that the
electrode distance is short (50µm) in comparison to
conventional planar devices at the same total charge,
This results in a fast (1-2 ns) collection time, low
(< 10V) depletion voltage and, with edge electrodes
in addition, a large active/inactive area ratio of the
device (cf. Fig. 15(b)).

The technical fabrication is much more involved
than for planar processes and requires a bonded sup-
port wafer and reactive ion etching of the electrodes
into the bulk. A compromise between 3D and planar
detectors, so called planar-3D detectors maintaining
the large active area, use planar technology but with
edge electrodes [37], obtained by diffusing the dopant
from the deeply etched edge and then ﬁlling it with
poly-silicon. Prototype detectors using strip or pixel
electronics have been fabricated and show encourag-
ing results with respect to speed (3.5 ns rise time)
and radiation hardness (≫ 1015 protons/cm2) [38].
3D-pixel detectors with LHC-type frontend electron-
ics have not been successfully built yet, although the
hybridization imposed no problem compared to stan-
dard hybrid pixel devices. A fabrication of 3D-pixel
structures adapted to the ATLAS FE-chip is under-
way [39].

IV. MONOLITHIC AND SEMI-MONOLITHIC

PIXEL DETECTORS

Monolithic pixel detectors, in which amplifying
and logic circuitry as well as the radiation detecting
sensor are one entity, are in the focus of present de-
velopments. To reach this ambitious goal, optimally
using a commercially available and cost effective
technology, would be another breakthrough in the
ﬁeld. The present developments have been much
inﬂuenced by R&D for vertex tracking detectors at
future colliders such as the International Linear e+e−
Collider (ILC) [40]. Very low (≪1% X0) material per
detector layer, small pixel sizes (∼20µm×20µm) and
a high rate capability (80 hits/mm2/ms) are required,
due to the very intense beamstrahlung of narrowly

B.

3D silicon sensors

So-called 3D silicon detectors have been devel-
oped [29] to overcome several limitations of conven-
tional planar Si-pixel detectors, in particular in high
radiation environments, in applications with inhomo-
geneous irradiation and in applications which require
a large active/inactive area ratio such as protein crys-
tallography [18]. A a 3D-Si-structure (Fig. 15(a))
is obtained by processing the n+ and p+ electrodes
into the detector bulk rather than by conventional
implantation on the surface. This is done by com-
bining VLSI and MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical
Systems) technologies. Charge carriers drift inside

focussed electron beams close to the interaction re-
gion, which produce electron positron pairs in vast
numbers. High readout speeds with typical line rates
of several 10 MHz and a 40µs frame readout time
are necessary.

At present,

two developments have already
reached some level of maturity: so called CMOS
active pixels and DEPFET pixels. Other promising
approaches, not mentioned in this review, are amor-
phous a-Si:H layers for charge collection superim-
posed on standard CMOS ASICS [41] as well as so
called SOI-sensors [42], which use a high-ohmic Si-
substracte with full charge collection wafer-bonded
to a CMOS electronics layer. Both active layers (sen-
sor and CMOS) are isolated by an insulating layer
through which a via-contact is made. These concepts
are still in their early development phases but of-
fer new possibilities once larger scale production is
mastered.

A. CMOS active pixels

In some CMOS chip technologies a lightly doped
epitaxial silicon layer of a few to 15µm thickness
between the low resistivity silicon bulk and the pla-
nar processing layer can be used for charge collec-
tion [43,44,45]. The generated charge is kept in a
thin epi-layer atop the low resistivity silicon bulk
by potential wells that develop at the boundary and
reaches an n-well collection diode by thermal diffu-
sion (cf. Fig. 16(a)). With small pixel cells collection
times in the order of 100 ns are obtained. The charge
collecting epi-layer is – technology dependent – at
most 15µm thick and can also be completely absent.
The attractiveness of active CMOS pixels lies in the
fact that standard CMOS processing techniques are
employed and hence they are potentially very cheap.
CMOS active pixel sensor development are pursued
by many groups which partially collaborate in various
projects (BELLE-upgrade,STAR-upgrade,ILC,CBM
at GSI) who use similar approaches to develop large
scale CMOS active pixels, also called MAPS (Mono-
lithic Active Pixel Sensors) [44]. A recent review can
be found in [46]. The sensor is depleted only directly
under the n-well diode. The signal charge is hence
very small (<1000e) and full charge collection is
obtained only in the depleted region under the n-well
electrode (cf Fig. 16(b)). Low noise electronics is
therefore the challenge in this development. Matrix
readout of MAPS is performed using a standard 3-
transistor circuit (line select, source-follower stage,

(MAPS) [44]. The charge is generated and collected by diffusion in
the very few µm thick epitaxial Si-layer. (bottom) MAPS signal re-

the right corresponds to full charge collection.

reset) commonly employed by CMOS matrix de-
vices, but can also include current ampliﬁcation and
current memory [47]. In the active ares only nMOS
transistors are permitted because of the n-well/p-epi
collecting diode which does not permit other n-wells.
For an image two complete frames are subtracted
from each other (correlated double sampling, CDS)
to eliminate base levels, 1/f and ﬁxed pattern noise
(see Figure 17). In a second step pedestals and com-
mon mode noise are subtracted to extract the signal
and to determine the remaining noise. Detector sizes
up to 19.4×17.4 mm2 with 1M pixels have been
tested. The smallest pixel pitch was 17µm. Frame
speeds of 10µs for 132x48 pixels have been reached
for the BELLE development, with a noise ﬁgure of
30-50e− [48]. With other pixel matrices with slower
readout noise values of 15-20 e−, S/N ratios larger
than 20 and spatial resolutions of 1.5µm (5µm) for
20µm (40µm) pitch have been measured [46]. The
presently favored technology is the AMS 0.35µm
OPTO process, which possesses a 10µm thick epi-
taxial layer. Regarding radiation hardness MAPS
appear to sustain non-ionizing radiation (NIEL) to
∼1012neq. The effects of ionizing radiation damage
(IEL), the main damage source at the ILC, are thresh-

outside the transistor. Ampliﬁcation values of ∼300
pA per collected electron in the internal gate have
been achieved. Further current ampliﬁcation and stor-
age enters at the second level stage. The bulk is fully
depleted yielding large signals and the small capaci-
tance of the internal gate offers low noise operation,
for a very large S/N ratio. This in turn can be used
to fabricate very thin devices. Thinning of pn-diodes
to a thickness of 50µm using a technology based on
wafer bonding and deep anisotropic etching has been
successfully demonstrated [57].

DEPFET pixels are being developed for three
very different application areas: vertex detection in
particle physics [58,59,60], X-ray astronomy [61,62]
and for biomedical autoradiography [63]. With sin-
gle pixel structures noise ﬁgures below 5e− and en-
ergy resolutions of 131 eV for 6 keV X-rays have
been obtained at room temperature [64]. The chal-
lenges for an ILC vertex detector are: small pixel
cells (∼20×30µm2),
thin, radiation hard sensors
(∼50µm), and fast readout (&10-20 MHz per ma-
trix row of 520x4000 pixels). This is pursued by a
Bonn-Mannheim-MPI Munich collaboration.

Readout of a DEPFET matrix is done by select-
ing a row by a gate voltage from a sequencer chip
(SWITCHER) to the external gate. The drains are
connected column-wise delivering their current to a
current-based readout chip (CURO) with ampliﬁca-
tion and current storage at the bottom of the col-
umn [65,64]. Both chips have been developed at close
to the desired speed for a Linear Collider. A sketch of
a module made of DEPFET sensors is shown in ﬁg.
19(top). Figure 19(bottom) shows a DEPFET pixel
matrix readout system used in the testbeam.

The radiation tolerance, in particular against ion-
izing radiation, which is expected to doses of 2 kGy
due to beamstrahlung at the ILC, again is a crucial
question. Irradiation with 30 keV X-rays up to doses
of ∼10 kGy, about ﬁve times the amount expected
at the ILC, have lead to transistor threshold shifts of
only about 4 V. Threshold shifts of this order can
be coped with by an adjustment of the correspond-
ing gate voltages supplied by the SWITCHER chip.
The estimated power consumption for a ﬁve layer
DEPFET pixel vertex detector at the ILC – assuming
a power duty cycle of 1:200 – is only ∼5W. Such a
performance renders a very low mass detector with-
out cooling pipes feasible.

A DEPFET pixel matrix with 128×64 pixels has

old shifts and leakage currents in and between nMOS
transistors. The damage effects are less severe when
short readout integration times (∼10µs) are used.
This way doses of about 10 kGy can be tolerated [46].

The present focus of further development lies
in improving the radiation tolerant design, making
50µm thin detectors, making larger area devices for
instance by stitching over reticle boundaries [49],
and increasing the charge collection performance
in the epi-layer by triple-well [50] or other tech-
niques [51,52,53].

B. DEPFET pixels

In so-called DEPFET pixel sensors [54] FET tran-
sistor is implanted in every pixel on a sidewards de-
pleted [55] bulk. Electrons generated by radiation in
the bulk are collected in a potential minimum under-
neath (∼ 1µm) the transistor channel (internal gate)
thus modulating its current (Fig. 18). Electrons col-

Figure 20 shows a hit in the DEPFET matrix to-

ters. The event on Fig. 20(right) is most likely ex-
plained by and consistent with the emission of a delta-
ray which remains in the sensor. This also qualita-
tively demonstrates the good reconstruction capabil-
ities to be expected from a DEPFET vertex detector.
At 6 GeV beam energy the spatial residuals are still
multiple scattering dominated. Residuals on the or-
der of 10µm are obtained, while with the large S/N
value of 144 true space resolutions in the order of
2µm should be possible.

V. SUMMARY

The large pixel detectors for LHC experiments,
based on the hyprid pixel technology, constitute the
state of the art in pixel detector technology. These
detectors are in construction and the maturity of the
technology, including radiation tolerance to 500 kGy
doses, has been proven. Immediate spin-off devel-
opments are hybrid pixel detectors with counting
capability in which radiation quanta are individually
counted. These developments open up a new ap-
proach to radiological imaging as well as to protein
crystallography with synchrotron radiation. Mono-
lithic or semi-monolithic detectors, in which detector
and readout ultimately are one entity, are currently
being developed in various forms, largely driven by
the needs for particle detection at the ILC. Most ma-
ture at present are CMOS active pixel sensors using
standard commercial technologies on low resistivity
bulk, and DEPFET-pixels, which maintain high bulk
resistivity for charge collection.

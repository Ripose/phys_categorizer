Abstract

In this paper we report a search for intermediate mass magnetic monopoles and nuclearites using CR39 and
Makrofol Nuclear Track Detectors (NTDs) of the SLIM large area experiment, 440 m2 exposed at the high
altitude laboratory of Chacaltaya (Bolivia) and about 100 m2 at Koksil, Himalaya (Pakistan). We discuss the
new chemical etching and improved analysis of the SLIM CR39 sheets. Preliminary limits are based on 316 m2
of CR39 NTDs exposed for 3.9 y.

Introduction

Grand Uniﬁed Theories (GUT) of the strong and electroweak interactions predict the existence
of magnetic monopoles (MMs) of large mass (1016 - 1018 GeV/c2), produced in the early
Universe. The MACRO experiment has set the best limits on GUT MMs for 4 × 10−5 <
β < 1, β= v/c [1-2].

Intermediate Mass Magnetic Monopoles (IMMs) may have been produced in later phase
transitions in the Early Universe; IMMs with masses 107 < mM < 1013 GeV and g > gD could
be present in the cosmic radiation and could be accelerated to relativistic velocities in one
coherent domain of the galactic magnetic ﬁeld [3-4]. Thus one may look for β ≥ 0.1, heavily
ionizing IMMs.

We used CR39 nuclear track detectors (NTDs) for a variety of studies: searches for magnetic
monopoles and nuclearites, determination of fragmentation cross-sections, search for nuclear
fragments with fractional charges, measurement of the composition of primary cosmic rays
[5-6].

The main aim of the present work is the determination of the optimal etching conditions to
achieve the best surface quality and to reduce the umber of background tracks in CR39 and
Makrofol NTDs used in the SLIM experiment.

2 Experimental

The SLIM experiment planned for the search of IMMs and Strange Quark Matter (SQM) is
based on 440 m2 of NTDs installed at the Chacaltaya high altitude lab. (5230 m a.s.l.) since
2001 [7]. Another 100 m2 of NTDs were installed at Koksil, Himalaya (Pakistan, 4270 m a.s.l.)
since 2002. The radon activity and the ﬂux of cosmic ray neutrons were measured at Chacaltaya
[8].

The SLIM basic unit is a “wagon” composed of 3 layers of 1.4 mm thick CR39, 3 layers of
500 µm Makrofol, 2 layers of 250 µm lexan sheets and an aluminium absorber of 1 mm thick,
see Fig. 1.

Extensive test studies were made in order to improve the etching procedures of CR39 and
Makrofol NTDs, and to improve the scanning eﬃciency and analysis procedures. In this note
we discuss the etching procedures for the SLIM CR39 and Makrofol NTDs.

The CR39 foils from SLIM modules exposed to cosmic rays and to 1 A GeV F e26+ ions
were originally etched without alcohol. We found several background tracks of 10-17 µm range
due to carbon, oxygen and proton recoils produced in the interactions of ambient neutrons;
see Figure 2(a, b): the surface quality of both sheets was poor. In these conditions, it would
be diﬃcult to scan the detectors. In order to improve the surface quality and to eliminate the
recoil tracks we etched the CR39 sheets with 8N KOH + 1.5% ethyl alcohol at 75 ◦C for 30
hr (see Figure 2(c, d)). The surface quality of the etched SLIM CR39 sheets improved and
most of the recoil tracks were removed. Moreover the detector is transparent and scanning is
easier. The tracks of the relativistic iron ions and their fragments have sharp contours and can
be easily measured with the automatic image analyzer system ”ELBEK”. The threshold of the
detector increased to Z/β ∼ 17.

CR39 “strong etching conditions” are now used for the ﬁrst (top) CR39 sheet in each SLIM
module (see Fig. 1), in order to produce ”large tracks”, easier to detect during scanning. “Soft
etching conditions” (6N NaOH + 1% Ethyl alcohol at 70 ◦C for 40 hours) are applied to the
other CR39 layers in a module [9], if a candidate track is found in the ﬁrst layer. Soft etching
allows more reliable measurements of the restricted energy loss (REL) and of the direction of
the incident particle.

The Makrofol detectors are etched in 6N KOH + 20% ethyl alcohol at 50 ◦C [10-11].

3 Calibration

The CR39 and Makrofol detectors were calibrated with 158 A GeV In49+ and P b82+ ions at the
CERN SPS and 1 A GeV F e26+ ions at the BNL AGS [11]. The base areas of the “post-etched
cones” were measured with an automatic image analyzer system. Fig. 3 shows the average base
area distribution of 158 A GeV In49+ ions and their fragments, the averages were made on two
front faces of CR39 sheets. With the above mentioned etching, the peaks are well separated
from Z/β = 7 to 45 and charge can be assigned to each individual peak.

The “strong” etching conditions for CR39 allow the detection of MMs with one unit Dirac
charge (g=gD), for β around 10−4 and for β > 10−2, the whole β-range of 4 ×10−5 < β < 1 for
MMs with g ≥ 2 gD, for dyons and for nuclearites. The Makrofol is useful for the search for
fast MMs. CR39 and Makrofol can detect nuclearites with β ≥ 10−3.

4 Results and Discussion

The top CR39 layer (see Fig. 1) of each wagon was chemically treated with our improved
“strong” etching conditions with alcohol to reduce the thickness of CR39 sheets from 1400
µm to 900 µm and to make large tracks. The etched CR39 sheets were transparent and with
low background. The sheets were scanned with stereomicroscopes searching for passing tracks,
which form a double cone, or through holes.

In order to compute the p-values and incident angles θ for the front and backsides, the track
major and minor axes are also measured. Finally, a track is deﬁned as a “candidate” if p
and θ on the front and backsides are equal to within 15%. In the presence of a candidate, the
lowermost CR39 layer was etched in “soft conditions”, and an accurate scan was performed with
an optical microscope at high magniﬁcation. Up to now no two-fold coincidences or through
holes were observed.

5 Conclusions

We analyzed an area of 316 m2 of SLIM CR39 sheets exposed for 3.9y at the Chacaltaya high
altitude lab. No candidate was observed; the 90% CL upper ﬂux limits for downgoing IMMs

Figure 4: 90% C.L. ﬂux upper limits for downgoing intermediate mass magnetic monopoles with g = gD, 2gD,
3gD and M+p.

with g = gD, 2gD, 3gD and M+p are plotted in Fig. 4 versus β.

Intermediate mass nuclearites lose more energy than g = gD magnetic monopoles; thus the
limit is at the level of the MM limit for β > 0.1 (Φ < 1.89 × 10−15 cm2 s−1 sr−1). A special
search was made for very light nuclearites; since we found no candidate the limit is as indicated
for IMMs at high β.

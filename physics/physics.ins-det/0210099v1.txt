Abstract

We demonstrate one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the semi-
conductor GaAs with 170 nanometer slice separation and resolve two regions of
reduced nuclear spin polarization density separated by only 500 nanometers. This
is achieved by force detection of the magnetic resonance, Magnetic Resonance Force
Microscopy (MRFM), in combination with optical pumping to increase the nuclear
spin polarization. Optical pumping of the GaAs creates spin polarization up to 12
times larger than the thermal nuclear spin polarization at 5 K and 4 T. The ex-
1011 71Ga/√Hz. These
periment is sensitive to sample volumes containing
results demonstrate the ability of force-detected magnetic resonance to apply mag-
netic resonance imaging to semiconductor devices and other nanostructures.

1 Introduction

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has had many beneﬁts to medicine and
biology. However, the low sensitivity of the conventional inductive detection
of nuclear magnetic moments has limited MRI to the micrometer scale and
above[1,2,3]. The alternative technique of force detection of the magnetic res-
onance, Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM)[4,5], increases both

the sensitivity and the resolution of MRI. Force detected NMR allows imaging
with resolution well below one micrometer in solids, which opens up the appli-
cation of MRI to semiconductor devices, thin ﬁlms, and other nanostructures.
In this article, we report force detection of 71,69Ga and 75As magnetic resonance
in the semiconductor GaAs, in combination with optical pumping[6,7] to in-
crease the nuclear spin polarization. We demonstrate one-dimensional nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging of GaAs with 170 nanometer slice separation and
resolve two regions of reduced nuclear spin polarization density separated by
only 500 nanometers.

The force measured in a MRFM experiment is the force between two mag-
nets: a small ferromagnet, and the nuclear (or electron) magnetic moments of
the sample. Figure 1 shows an illustration of the MRFM probe head. In our
experiment, the ferromagnet is a 250 µm diameter iron cylinder. The sample

260
is a
∼
1018 cm−3 Be. To detect the force between the sample and the ferro-
2.0
×
magnet, the GaAs sample is mounted with silver-ﬁlled epoxy on the end of a
microcantilever and positioned 60 µm from the surface of the iron magnet. We
used a Si3N4 cantilever[8] coated with 300 ˚A Ti and 700 ˚A Au on both sides
for thermal conductivity (total spring constant k of the Au/Ti/Si3N4/Ti/Au
0.05 N/m). The loaded cantilever has a mechanical resonant fre-
sandwich
quency, fc = 490 Hz and Q = 75 at 5 K in He exchange gas. The motion of the
cantilever is observed with a ﬁber optic interferometer[9]. Further description
of the cryostat and electronics is given in references [10,11].

∼

×

The oscillation of the cantilever is driven by cyclic adiabatic rapid passage
(ARP)[12]. The RF magnetic ﬁeld (ωRF /2π = 51.50 MHz) has a triangle wave

2

frequency modulation with peak-to-peak frequency width of 2Ω/2π, which ﬂips
the resonant nuclei at a frequency fARP . The RF magnetic ﬁeld (2B1
0.4
mT) is provided by a 700 µm diameter, 1 1/2 turn copper coil. The static
magnetic ﬁeld for resonance (3.96 T for 71Ga at 51.50 MHz) is provided by the
combination of an external superconducting magnet and the 250 µm diameter
iron cylinder. The small size of the iron magnet results in a large magnetic ﬁeld
gradient (6000 T/m) at the center of the sample which provides the spatial
selectivity for imaging. Only those spins in a total magnetic ﬁeld satisfying
the resonance condition will contribute to the signal.

∼

×

Even at 5 K, the thermal spin polarization of the nuclei is rather small,
10−4. To increase the nuclear spin polarization, we optically pump the
6
GaAs sample[6,7,13]. An optical ﬁber shines circularly polarized light on the
sample with a wavelength of 823 nm (near the bandgap of GaAs). Because of
the GaAs band structure, the circularly polarized light creates electron-hole
pairs with the electrons having 50% net polarization. The electrons then po-
larize the nuclei, through hyperﬁne interactions primarily at electronic defects
(dynamic nuclear polarization). The optical pumping was typically done at 0.2
T external applied ﬁeld because of the higher nuclear polarization achieved at
low ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld was then ramped up for the NMR measurements.
Because of the long T1 (21
5 min)[11], very little spin polarization is lost in
the roughly one minute required to change the magnetic ﬁeld. The optical
power (roughly 1400 W/m2) was kept low to avoid heating the sample. Since
the sample is mounted at the end of a thin cantilever, thermal conductance

3 Results

We observed all three naturally abundant nuclear isotopes in GaAs, 71Ga, 69Ga
and 75As, as shown in ﬁgure 2. The large width of the isotope peaks reﬂects
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient and the spatial extent of the sample. Each isotope
peak is a 1D image of the nuclear spin polarization density of that isotope. For
our cylindrical magnet, the imaging slices are shaped like a plate (thin with
some curvature), as shown in cross-section in ﬁgure 3. The ﬁrst signal at the
lowest external magnetic ﬁeld is from the bottom center of the sample. The
signal grows rapidly with increasing external ﬁeld as the slice volume extends
deeper into the 3 µm thick sample. Once the tip of the imaging slice extends
beyond the sample, the signal size declines slowly because of the reduced sam-
ple volume within the imaging slice. Using the observed maximum oﬀset of
the signal from the nominal resonance ﬁelds and the saturation magnetization
for iron (2.18 T)[14], we can calculate the magnetic ﬁeld gradient and the res-
onant slice geometry. For the imaging slice corresponding to the peak signal
, 3.388 T), the slices are separated by 170 nm with a total volume

The diﬀerence in the decline of the signal at higher external ﬁelds is caused by
spatial variation in the optical pumping, which is most eﬀective at the center
of the sample. Figure 5 shows the nuclear spin polarization enhancement by
optical pumping. Optical pumping at 0.2 T external ﬁeld creates nuclear po-
larization as much as 12 times greater than the thermal polarization achieved
at 5K and 4 T.

To demonstrate our ability to resolve structure in the nuclear spin polarization
density, we want to see how close two planes of nuclear polarization can be
and still be distinguished. To create contrast in our uniform GaAs sample, we
sweep the magnetic ﬁeld with constant frequency RF on, which inverts the
nuclear polarization. During this sweep, we reduce the nuclear polarization
in two closely spaced slices by exposing them to several seconds of cyclic
ARP (see Fig. 6). Between the two slices of reduced polarization, we leave
a third slice whose polarization is inverted along with the rest of the sample

we measure the resulting polarization. As shown in ﬁgure 4, we can resolve
the nuclear spin polarization signal from two slices separated by only 500 nm.
This is only an upper limit on the resolution of this instrument because we
are doing cyclic ARP on each slice twice: ﬁrst to reduce the spin polarization
to provide contrast and then a second time to measure the image. Some of the
blurring of the slices occurs in the creation of the spin-polarization contrast

4 Discussion

The thickness of the spatial imaging slices in our experiment is primarily
determined by the frequency width of the ARP relative to the magnetic ﬁeld
gradient. In this experiment, the highest resolution data was taken with the
peak-to-peak frequency modulation of the adiabatic rapid passage, 2Ω/2π = 4
kHz (equivalent to 0.31 mT for 71Ga) and the data points were taken every
1 mT. The data points are thus separated by the magnetic ﬁeld step size
divided by the ﬁeld gradient, 1 mT / (6000 T/m) = 170 nm. We found that
reducing the ARP modulation further rapidly reduced the SNR. This is logical
because there are multiple eﬀects which smear the spatial resolution at the
0.1 mT level. First, there is B1
0.2 mT, which determines the width of the
resonance. Assuming that the adiabatic condition is met during the passage
and that relaxation processes can be neglected, the modulation of the z-axis
magnetization is[5]

where M0(r) is the nuclear polarization at position r, γ is the nuclear gy-
romagnetic ratio (γ = 2π
ωRF
is the oﬀset ﬁeld from resonance, and B(r) is the total magnetic ﬁeld at a
position r in the sample. The time variable, t, varies from -1 to +1 during
the adiabatic passage. This equation is correct for the spin 3/2 nuclei in this
experiment, 71,69Ga and 75As, as long as the quadrupole coupling is negligible.
In this equation, B1 has two eﬀects. Large B1 increases the width of the res-
onance, thus modulating spins further from the center of the slice. Large B1
also increases the frequency width, Ω, required to fully modulate the spins. A
small γB1 relative to Ω is required to have the slice width depend primarily
on Ω. Having γB1 < Ω provides a large modulation of the spins and sharper
edges of the imaging slice.

−

However, B1 in combination with Ω and fARP also determines the adiabatic-
ity of the rapid passages. To have adiabatic passages requires the adiabatic
parameter A,

A =

(γB1)2
4ΩfARP ≫

1

(2)

This equation clearly favors large B1. Figure 6 shows the eﬀect of fARP , B1,
and γ on the decay time τm of the nuclear magnetization driven by ARP.
The available measurement time becomes signiﬁcant for B1 > 0.05 mT. As a
result, the experiment requires both γB1 . Ω and (γB1)2
4ΩfARP . If we
take γB1 = Ω, we can simplify these equations to see that we require roughly
γB1 . Ω. Since minimizing Ω gives us the highest resolution, we also
4fARP ≪
want to minimize fARP . In order to use the Q enhancement of the mechanical
cantilever resonance to amplify the signal relative to measurement noise, we
want fARP = fc. In this experiment, a rather large sample was deliberately
used to mass load the cantilever and lower its resonant frequency, fc.

≫

Besides these considerations for the cyclic ARP measurement, sample proper-
ties also can provide limits to the current experimental resolution. The intrin-
sic linewidth of 71Ga in GaAs is about 0.2 mT[13]. As can be seen in ﬁgure
6(c), even if the rapid passage is very adiabatic, the driven magnetization still
decays in about 10 seconds. Even for an adiabatic passage, the time spent on
resonance is limited by the spin lock time constant, T1ρ. Another eﬀect which
could limit spatial resolution is spin diﬀusion. The eﬀect of spin diﬀusion was
not seen in this experiment. Spin diﬀusion should become important as the
resolution is further increased based on the expected spin diﬀusion constants,
(D = 10−13 cm2/s for 75As[7]).

The current resolution is limited by the size of B1 and linewidth relative to
the magnetic ﬁeld gradient, not the sensitivity. There is room for improvement
of the resolution (and the sensitivity, also) by decreasing the size of the fer-

7

romagnetic particle, which increases the magnetic ﬁeld gradient. Higher ﬁeld
gradients have already been used for ESR experiments[15]. For detailed com-
parisons of mechanical versus inductive detection of magnetic resonance, see
references [16,17].

5 Conclusions

We have used force-detected magnetic resonance to image GaAs in one-dimension
with 170 nanometer slice spacing and resolve two regions of reduced nuclear
spin polarization density separated by only 500 nanometers. We also demon-
strated the combination of force-detected magnetic resonance with optical
pumping to increase nuclear spin polarization. We can detect volumes con-
1011 71Ga/√Hz with orders of magnitude of further improve-
taining
ment expected. This enables NMR of very small samples and high resolution
imaging. We envision wide ranging application of force-detected magnetic res-
onance to study many types of samples including biological membranes and
molecules, surfaces and thin ﬁlms, and semiconductor materials and devices.

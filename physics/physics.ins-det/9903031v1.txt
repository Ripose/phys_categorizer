The ALEPH Silicon Vertex Detector features an optical ﬁbre laser system to monitor its mechanical stability.
The operating principle and the general performance of the laser system are described. The experience obtained
during 1997 and 1998 operations conﬁrms the important role that such a system can have with respect to the
detector alignment requirements. In particular, the laser system has been used to monitor short-term temperature-
related eﬀects and long-term movements. These results and a description of the laser-based alignment correction
applied to the 1998 data are presented.

1. Introduction

The ALEPH Silicon Vertex Detector (VDET)
has an active length of 40 cm and consists of two
concentric cylindrical layers of 144 micro-strip sil-

2

icon detectors of ∼ 5.3 × 6.5 cm2 with double-
sided readout. Six of them are glued together and
instrumented with readout electronics on each
end to form the VDET elementary unit (face).
The inner layer (∼ 6.3 cm radius) is formed by
9 faces, the outer layer (∼ 10.5 cm radius) con-
sists of 15 faces. Strips on p+-side run parallel to
z axis in the ALEPH reference system, allowing
rφ coordinates measurement; n-side strips, run-
ning normal to z axis, allow z coordinate mea-
surement. A detailed description of VDET can
be found elsewhere [1].

2. Laser system

VDET features a laser system to monitor me-
chanical stability with respect to the external
tracking devices. A large movement (> 20 µm) of
the VDET during data-taking could degrade sig-
niﬁcantly the b-tagging performance.
It is thus
very important to keep this aspect under strict
control. This is especially true at LEP2, where
the detector alignment is performed on an initial
sample of Z events and monitoring using the high
energy data itself is diﬃcult due to the reduced
event rates.

The system uses infrared light (λ = 904 nm)
from two pulsed laser diodes with an output
power of 6 W each and a pulse length of 50 ns.
The light is distributed via optical ﬁbres to prisms
and lenses attached to the inner wall of the Inner
Tracking Chamber (ITC, the closest outer detec-
tor). The lenses focus 44 light spots on 14 of the
15 VDET outer faces3, normally 3 spots per face,
two spots close to the ends of the face and one
spot about in the middle of the face. All laser
beams are nominally parallel to the xy plane;
laser beams at the VDET ends are normal to
the silicon surface while laser beams that point to
the central wafers have an azimuthal incident an-
gle close to 45 degrees, in order to be sensitive to
movements normal to the face plane. Information
on the VDET displacements with respect to the
ITC are obtained by monitoring the laser beam
impact position on the silicon wafers (laser spot)
versus time: the rφ spot position is sensitive only

to displacements in the xy plane and the z spot
position is sensitive only to displacements along
the z direction. An xy section of the VDET indi-
cating the nominal laser beam positions is shown
in Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 a sketch of the typical laser
spot positions on a face is shown. For a detailed
description of the VDET laser system see [2].

The laser system operates during standard data
taking: the laser trigger, synchronized with the
beam-crossing signal, is ﬁred once per minute (ap-
proximately once per ∼ 100 physics events) and
the laser event is acquired as a standard physics
event. After the installation 5 spots out of 44
spots were absent, probably due to misalignment
of the optics or breakage of the optical ﬁbre. For
the remaining spots, the eﬃciency is essentially
100% due to the large pulse height of a spot clus-
ter. During 1997 (1998) ∼ 62000 (∼ 129000) laser
events were collected.

3. Analysis of displacements

3One face is not equipped because the mechanical struc-
ture nearby does not allow the optic installation.

rithm. A deviation, ∆, is deﬁned for each event
and for each spot as the diﬀerence between the
actual spot position and a nominal position.

The raw deviation for a typical spot as a func-
tion of time shows various features: a long term
eﬀect (Fig. 3 (a)), a medium term eﬀect, present
after quite long shutdown periods (Fig. 3 (b)),
and a short term eﬀect with a timescale of a few
hours (Fig. 3 (c)).

3.1. Short and Medium Term Eﬀects

The rφ and z deviations of the three spots of
a face are plotted in Fig. 4 (a) and (b) for a four
day period after a long shutdown. Also shown
is a time chart of the VDET temperature over
the same period (Fig. 4 (c)). The rφ side shows
clear short and medium term eﬀects correlated
with the temperature variations. In order to re-
duce the probability of radiation damage, VDET
is completely ON only when LEP is in “stable
beams”. The rφ central spot, which is at 45◦
and therefore sensitive to radial motion, shows
the biggest deviation and is consistent with the
expected face bowing due to the bimetallic eﬀect
(the face has a kevlar and carbon ﬁbre beam glued
on the silicon to ensure mechanical rigidity). The
medium term eﬀect is visible in Fig. 4 (a) for the
deviation of the central spot. It seems that “equi-
librium” is only reached after about two days af-
ter a long shutdown. This medium term eﬀect is
also thought to be due to the face bowing. During
standard running, OFF periods are short (∼ 1÷2

partial; during long shutdowns (more than ∼ 1
day) the recovery is complete and after that a
certain time is needed to reach again the normal
warming-cooling cycle.

The maximum bowing sagitta S and the time
constant τ involved in these temperature related
phenomena can be estimated by ﬁtting the follow-
ing parametrisation over the 45◦ spot deviation ∆
versus time t:

∆(t) = S ·

The ﬁts have been done over a typical ON period
just after a long shutdown (with t0 = 0) and over
a standard ON period far from a long shutdown
(with free t0). Depending on the face, the sagitta
ranges from ∼ 5 to 12 µm with a mean of 8 µm
and the time constant τ varies from ∼ 130 to
280 min with a mean of 160 min. For the track-
ing performance the short term displacements are
small enough to be neglected, especially as they

mainly aﬀect the radial direction.

For the short term case the width of the resid-
ual distribution of data points with respect to the
parametrisation in Eq. 1 is an estimate of the spa-
tial resolution for a single event. Thanks to the
large pulse height and the fact the cluster extends
over more than one readout strip, the resolution
is typically 0.5 to 1.5 µm.

3.2. Long-term Eﬀects

The long term eﬀect is visible in Fig. 5, where
the spot deviations with respect to initial values
are plotted versus time for the entire 1998 data
taking period. Some spots are not displayed be-
cause they are missing or are not used in the anal-
ysis due to inadequate pulse height or unusual
cluster proﬁle. The rφ side deviations show a
systematic long term drift that depends on face
number (see Fig. 7 for face numbering conven-
tion). The size of the xy displacements are as
large as ∼ 20 µm and are larger than the single

the contrary, the z side deviations are smaller and
quite similar.

During 1997 and 1998 this unexpected be-
haviour has been studied, parametrised and an
alignment correction has been implemented.

The laser spots do not provide enough informa-
tion to fully reconstruct the displacements of each
individual face, nevertheless the observed devia-
tions do not seem to be due to an independent
motion of the faces. The observed long term
deviations are thus parametrised assuming that

Figure 6. Long term xy alignment parameters
relative to the initial Z calibration run. The same
parameters obtained from the alignments using
charged tracks are also plotted.

VDET is moving as a rigid body with respect to
the initial position, given by the alignment pro-
cedure with tracks performed at the beginning of
data taking in a run at the Z resonance. The de-
viation of a spot is expressed as a function of the
standard parameters used to describe the motion
of rigid bodies, consisting of 3 angles and 3 trans-
lation vectors. These are then extracted by a ﬁt
procedure that minimises the squared diﬀerences
between the observed and the predicted deviation
of the spots.

The ﬁt has been performed, with 3 out of the
6 parameters ﬁxed to zero: the two rotation an-
gles about the x and y axes, having found negli-
gible displacement in xz and yz planes, and the
translation along z because the observed z dis-
placement is more consistent with a deformation
rather than a global displacement. The result is
shown in Fig. 6, where the three free parameters

cap A spots: the points represent the spot posi-
tion during time. The displacement is ampliﬁed
by a factor of 1000. The small segments, plotted
outside the outer layer, are the actual raw devi-
ations of the corresponding spot (with the same
magniﬁcation). The cross is the probable rotation
centre.

(x translation, y translation and z rotation) are
plotted versus time starting from the initial Z run.
A pictorial view of the corresponding VDET dis-
placement is shown in Fig. 7; it is consistent with
a rotation around the bottom face.

For the ﬁt, the deviations have been averaged
over a period of two days. The errors on the pa-
rameters are estimated “a posteriori” by forcing
the χ2
min to be equal to the number of degrees of
freedom; the resulting uncertainty on the single
spot deviation is plotted in Fig. 8 versus time. Al-
though the single spot spatial resolution is better
than that given in Fig. 8, the rigid body assump-
tion does not take into account possible structural
deformations, misalignment of the ﬁbres or inde-
pendent motion of the faces.

The time dependent motion of the VDET ex-
tracted from the laser system has also been inde-
pendently conﬁrmed using charged tracks in data
acquired at high energy and also during a run
at the Z resonance taken at the end of the 1998
data taking. To cope with the low statistics dur-
ing the high energy running, the alignments were
performed averaging over a ∼ 1 month period.
The values for the alignment parameters so ob-
tained are also plotted in Fig. 6 and are gener-
ally in good agreement. In the x translation, the
alignment points are shifted with respect to laser
points from about day 60. This is correlated with
a beam loss into the Time Projection Chamber
ﬁeld cage that caused a measurable (10 µm) rel-
ative displacement of the TPC with respect to
the ITC. This emphasises that the alignment ob-
tained directly from the data is also sensitive to
any time dependence of the alignment of the other
tracking chambers.

Based on the alignment parameters extracted
from the laser system, a time dependent correc-
tion to the initial Z alignment has been applied
to all the 1998 data. Fig. 9 shows the distribution
of the sum of the impact parameters of the two
muons in dimuon events before and after applying
the alignment correction. Without the correction
the mean of the distribution is shifted by 13 µm,
when the correction is applied the distribution is
centered close to zero as expected.

The observed rotation of the VDET may be
explained as follows: the VDET is supported by

two “feet” which slot into two long metal rails lo-
cated at the top and bottom of the ITC cylinder.
It seems that the VDET is rotating around the
lower foot (small cross in Fig. 7). Although the
lower foot is rigid (made of metal), the upper foot
had to be “springy” (made of plastic) in order to
allow for distance variations between the top and
bottom rails as the VDET slides along the rails
during the installation process. It is thought that
the plastic foot suﬀers some small deformation.

4. Conclusions

The laser based alignment system for the
ALEPH vertex detector is operational.
It al-
lows reliable and high precision monitoring of the
VDET position during data taking.
It has al-
lowed the study of small temperature related mo-
tions and revealed a long term rotation of the
VDET. An alignment correction based on the in-
formation from this system has been successfully
applied.

1 Introduction

Particle-identiﬁcation (PID) capability plays an essential role in experiments
at B-factories. Especially, π/K identiﬁcation in the momentum range up to
4 GeV/c over a wide angular region is crucially important for the primary
physics goals to measure CP violation. In the Belle detector at KEK-B, a com-
bination of Aerogel Cherenkov counters, TOF counters and dE/dX measure-
ment in a central drift chamber (CDC) provides PID information for charged
particles [1]. Although the present detector system covers most of the mo-
mentum region of the charged particles, the PID power for a particle with
momentum above 3 GeV/c is not suﬃciently satisfactory. Concerning the fu-
ture upgrade of PID devices, we discuss here the eﬀectiveness of measuring
both the Time-of-Propagation (TOP) and the emission-angle of the Cherenkov
photons.

The time resolution of the Time-of-Flight (TOF) counter using a plastic scin-
tillator is inherently limited by the following eﬀects besides the transit-time
spread (TTS) of a phototube: (1) a ﬁnite decay-time of photon emission, and
(2) a diﬀerent photon propagation-length or propagation-time in the scin-
tillator to a phototube, depending on the photon emission angle. Thus, the
conventional TOF counter measures the arrival time of the earliest photons
out of many, whereby the remaining large amount of photons are not eﬀec-
tively used for the time measurement. While eﬀect (1) cannot be reduced as
far as the scintillation is concerned, eﬀect (2) can be resolved by the mea-
suring the arrival times of the earliest photons as a function of the photon
emission angle, since, in the total-reﬂection-type scintillator bar, most pho-
tons propagate in the scintillator while keeping their original emission angles.
This two-dimensional information could improve the time resolution, depend-
ing on the number of angular segmentations of the photon detector and on
the number of photons collected at each segment.

When Cherenkov radiation is utilized, although its number of produced pho-
tons is much smaller than in the scintillation case, eﬀect (1) can, in principle,
be disregarded. In addition, since the Cherenkov photon emission-angle is
uniquely determined by the particle velocity (β) and since the propagation
time of photons in a light guide of an internal-total-reﬂection type can be
calculated as a function of the photon emission angle, a measurement of a
correlation between TOP and the photon emission anlge could provide PID
information by itself, as we propose below.

2

In the DIRC concept [2, 3], Cherenkov photons produced by a quartz radiator
are transported to an end of the radiator by means of internal total reﬂection,
and its ring image is magniﬁed and projected onto a photon-detector plane
placed at the bar end. A basic study of this concept clearly proved that a
photon is eﬀectively transported in the long quartz bar, preserving its origi-
nal photon direction. The Babar detector at SLAC adopted this concept for
PID, and introduced a large stand-oﬀ photon detection system in order to
ineﬀectuate the ﬁnite size of the quartz cross-section onto the ring image [3].
On the other hand, Kamae et al. [4] proposed a compact focussing type of
DIRC using a small mirror instead of a large stand-oﬀ system. This approach
suits particles incident normal to the quartz bar, but for inclined particles the
ring image is distorted due to the ﬁnite quartz cross-section. To make this
image-fusing eﬀect insigniﬁcant, the size and geometry of the focussing mirror
become unfeasible [5].

We propose here a new concept for the Cherenkov-ring image detector, the
TOP detector. The two-dimensional information of the ring image is repre-
sented by the TOP of the Cherenkov photon and its horizontal angle (Φ;
see, Fig.1). The use of TOP information with an appropriate focussing mirror
makes the image-fusing eﬀect be disregarded and compactiﬁcation can be re-
alized while maintaining the high enough PID ability. We describe below the
basic concept, characteristic features, practical conﬁgurations and simulation
results on the TOP detector, and discuss some issuses for making it a realistic
device.

We should mention a paper by Honsheid et al. [6], which we noticed after our
detailed analysis had been completed. It discusses the Cherenkov Correlated
Timing (CCT) detector: CCT [6, 7] is a kind of TOF counter with a single
phototube readout for detecting early arriving photons of Cherenkov radiation.
In ref.[6] a similar concept as ours can be found, although no detailed study
is presented and the focussing mirror approach is not introduced.

2 Conceptual Design and Expected Properties

The principal structure of the TOP counter in the (x, y, z) coordinate system is
illustrated in Fig.1. When a charged particle passes through the radiator bar,
Cherenkov photons are emitted in a conical direction deﬁned by the emission
angle (θC), where cos θC=1/nβ, n=refractive index. Then, photons propagate
to both or either ends by means of total reﬂection on the internal bar surface.

3

Photons propagating backward are reﬂected by a ﬂat mirror at the end. At
the forward end, photons are horizontally focused by a butterﬂy-shaped mirror
onto a plane where position-sensitive multi-anode phototubes are equipped to
measure TOP as a function of the Φ-angle.

2.1 TOP and Φ

The TOP is determined only by the z-component of the light velocity in the
quartz bar as

T OP =

L

1
qz !

,

 

c/n(λ) ! ×  

= 4.90(ns)

L(m)
qz

,

×

where L is the overall distance from the photon emission point to the detector,
n(λ) is the refractive index of the quartz at wavelength λ, c is the light velocity
in a vacuum, and qz is the directional z-component of the photon emission.

Denoting the polar and azimuthal angles of an incident charged particle as θinc
and φinc (see, Fig.1), respectively, the directional components of the photon
velocity qi (i=x, y, z) are written as

qy′ sin φinc + qz′ sin θinc cos φinc,
qx = qx′ cos θinc cos φinc
qy = qx′ cos θinc sin φinc + qy′ cos φinc + qz′ sin θinc sin φinc,
qz =

qx′ sin θinc + qz′ cos θinc,

−

−

where qi’s (i=x′, y′, z′) are the directional components of the photon emission
in the frame where the particle moves along the z′-axis:

qx′ = sin θC cos φC,
qy′ = sin θC sin φC,
qz′ = cos θC.

The horizontal and vertical photon angles at the bar end are then given as

(4)

The φC angle of Cherenkov photons distributes uniformly over 2π. When we
ﬁx φC, individual three-directional components (qi) are uniquely related to
θC. Therefore, a measurement of any two directional components or any two
combinations of them among eqs.(3) and (4) provides information about θC.

Accordingly, in a TOP concept, we use the two parameters (qz, Φ) for extract-
ing θC, while in DIRC, (Θ, Φ) are used. The advantage of our approach is that
the qz measurement is not seriously inﬂuenced by the quartz bar cross-section.

2.2 Accuracy of the TOP measurement

Here, we estimate various contributions to the accuracy of the TOP measure-
ment with a detector which we are preparing for R&D work. By modelling
the detector as presented in Fig.1, the parameters of each element and the
expected machining or construction accuracy are assumed as described below.

The size of the radiator bar is 20 mm-thick (in y), 60 mm-wide (in x ), and
about 3 150 mm (in z ), on which a butterﬂy-shaped forcussing mirror block
and a ﬂat reﬂection mirror are attached at the forward and backward ends,
respectively. The focussing mirror comprises two sub-elements, each forming
an arc of a circle with a radius of 250 mm. As a PID detector for the Belle
experiment, we suppose these detectors to be placed at R=1 m from the beam
axis to form a cylindrical conﬁguration, and due to an asymmetric-energy col-
lider the detector is asymmetrically conﬁgured with respect to the z-direction
to cover the polar angle from 30o to 140o in the lab-frame. For simplicity of
calculation, the photon-propagation length in the focussing mirror is set as 20
cm for all photons.

The material of the radiator bar and the mirrors is synthetic optical quartz
(SUPRASIL-P30) manufactured by Shin-etsu Quartz Co. and their surfaces
5 µm. The quartz has
are polished by Bikovsky-Japan Co. with a ﬂatness of
a refractive index of n=1.47 at a wavelength (λ) of 390 nm and a transmit-
tance of 90%/m at λ=250 nm. The reﬂecting surface of the mirrors comprises
aluminum of a few 100 nm-thick on 200 ˚A-thick chromium by evaporation,

±

5

which provides a reﬂection eﬃciency of 98%. The photon detector (R5900U-
00-L16) is a multi-anode (16 channel) linear array phototube with a bialkali
window by Hamamatsu Photonics Co. Although this tube does not function
under a magnetic ﬁeld, it has a quite suitable TTS for our early R&D work
without a magnetic ﬁeld.

Now, by taking the above structure of the TOP counter into account, we es-
timate various contributions to the accuracy of the PID measurement.

(1) λ-dependence of n

The refractive index (n(λ)) of the quartz varies depending on λ. As a result,
the Cherenkov angle (θC) and the total reﬂection angle vary for individual
photons in addition to the propagation velocity. The eﬀect to TOP is

(∆n/n= 5
section.

(2) Angular resolution

The Φ-angle resolution depends on the position resolution of the phototube
and the focussing accuracy of the mirror. The designed focussing mirror has
a resolution of σ=0.8 mm with a dispersion of dΦ/dx=0.5o/mm. Since the
phototube has a 0.8 mm anode width, as described below, the Φ resolution is
evaluated as σΦ

0.5o.

≈

The Φ-dependent behavior of this eﬀect on TOP shows a steep increase with
Φ, but a very small contribution at small Φ-angles, as numerically discussed

6

in the next subsection. This limits the Φ aparture to be

Φ

45o.

(3) TTS of the phototube

16 mm photo-sensitive area,
The phototube (R5900U-00-L16) has a 16 mm
which is segmented into 16 strips with an area of 0.8 mm
16 mm and a 0.2
mm space between adjacent strips. The quantum eﬃciency (QE) is 25% at 400
nm and σTTS
70 ps with a pulse rise-time of 0.6 ns for a single photoelectron.

×

×

≈

(4) Timing accuracy of the start signal

We expect a start timing accuracy of 25 ps from the RF signal of the acceler-
ator.

(5) Eﬀect of the quartz thickness

Because relativistic particle takes 66 ps to pass through the 20 mm-thick
quartz, the time spread of the Cherenkov photon emission is estimated to be
σthick= 20 ps (=66 /√12). When the incident particle is inclined with respect
to the normal of the bar surface, the time-spread becomes much smaller due
to cancelleration of the particle ﬂight-time and the photon propagation-time.
For instance, σthick is 6 ps and 10 ps at θinc= 30o and 60o, respectively.

(6) Eﬀect of the charged-particle tracking accuracy

In the Belle detector, the z position of a charged-particle track is measured
by the central drift chamber (CDC) with an accuracy of about 2 mm. This
means that it corresponds to a time uncertainty of 10 ps.

On the other hand, the accuracy of the momentum measurement is related to
the accuracy of the Cherenkov angle as

σθC =

cot θC

 

γ2 ! ×

.

Since the Cherenkov angle satisﬁes cot θC
provides σp/p
the Cherenkov angle between π and K. The former is on the order of 10−2

1 for our particles and the CDC
10−3, σθC can be ignored compared with the diﬀerence in

is 7

10−2 mrad for 4 GeV/c π and K, respectively.

(9)

The eﬀect of any θinc ambiguity on TOP is evaluated to be less than 10 ps
in the case of the Belle detector [1]. It is an order-of-magnitude smaller than
the contribution from item (3) (σTTS
70 ps), and is thus disregarded. Fur-
≈
thermore, it is, on the other hand, a speciﬁc feature of our approarch that
the TOP is independent of φinc, as is obvious from eq.(2). Therefore, the φinc
ambiguity does not intrinsically aﬀect the TOP measurement.

2.3 Expected separability

From the above, the uncertainty of the TOP measurement arises predomi-
nantly from the eﬀects of items (1), (2) and (3). In order to understand the
TOP behavior and to evaluate the size of the above eﬀects to TOP and the
PID power, a calculation is performed with the following conditions. The λ
dependence of the refractive index is disregarded, but its eﬀect is represented
0.008 in eq.(5); the Φ resolution is set as σΦ = 0.5o; the eﬀects
by n= 1.47
of the items (4) and (5) and the digitization bin of 25 ps are included into (3)
to make an eﬀective σTSS=80 ps (denoted hereafter as (3)′); the eﬃciencies of
photon propagation and reﬂection are assumed to be 100%.

±

For PID in the collider geometry, in addition to the TOP measurement, we
added to the TOP the particle’s TOF from the colliding point to the quartz
radiator placed at R=1 m.

2.3.1. δ(TOP+TOF) and individual eﬀects

8

In Fig.2, the individual uncertainties of items (1), (2) and (3)′ are shown
for various cases of the incident angle (θinc), in addition to the TOP+TOF
and TOP diﬀerences between 4 GeV/c π and K (denoted hereafter as δ(TOP
+TOF) and δ(TOP), respectively). (The propagation length (L) in Figures
(a-e) is uniquely determined for each θinc by assuming the particle coming from
the colliding point under our geometory. On the other hand, the length (L)
in Figures (f, g) is not real, but hypothetical, only for discussion purposes.)
The asymmetries seen in the ﬁgures are caused by deﬂection of the azimuthal
angle of the incident particle due to an axial magnetic ﬁeld of 1.5 T.

At normal incidence (see, Fig.2(c), (d) and (g)), eﬀect (1) is an order of mag-
nitude smaller than δ(TOP); this relation holds irrespective of L, because of
their proportionality to L. Eﬀect (2) has a strong Φ dependence. In the re-
gion of the small Φ-angle the eﬀect is negligible, while in the large-Φ region
it becomes dominant in determining the resolution. Mostly from this fact,
45o, where the TOP measurement
the Φ-angle aperture is limitted to
Φ
uncertainty is comparable to or less than δ(TOP+TOF) under most of the
incident-particle conditions. On the other hand, because θinc deviates from
normal incidence the value of α decreases, and item (1) gives almost the same
order of magnitude as δ(TOP+TOF) at θinc = 30o (Fig.2(a)), and several to
10-times larger size at θinc = 140o (Fig.2(e)).

45o, since θinc almost coincides with the Cherenkov angle (

45o or
Note that the sign of δ(TOP) at small Φ reverses at around θinc
θinc-90o
45o)
and then the relative magnitude of qz of Cherenkov photons from π and K re-
verses (see, Fig.2(a, e, f)). Thus, in the case of large L, as in Fig.2(f), δ(TOP)
is cancelled with δ(TOF), which reduces the PID power compared with the
small L case, as in Fig.2(a).

∼

2.3.2. π/K separability

In the previous discussion, the expected resolution for the TOP measurement
is given for the detection of a single Cherenkov photon. However, when we use
the position-sensitive photon detector, we can use every Cherenkov photon to
obtain PID information. In order to estimate the PID performance, we deﬁne
the π/K separability (So) as

δ(T OP + T OF )i

In the calculation, a single Cherenkov photon is assigned at every one-degree
in φC over a range of 2π, and individual δ(TOP+TOF)i and the total uncer-
tainty (σT)i arising from the above-mentioned items are obtained for every
45o,
i-th photon. The summation is taken over for the photons with
which are totally reﬂected on the internal surface of the quartz bar. Because

In Fig.3 the resultant So for π/K is presented as a function of the particle
momentum (p) for three diﬀerent θinc’s. For a normal incident particle, two
cases are considered separately: (a) Cherenkov photons directly come to the
photon detector (FW), or (b) go to the backward end and then return to
the detector (BW). A better separation is obtained for (b) because of the
longer propagation distance of photons. The incident-angle dependence of So
is shown in Fig.4 for p=2, 4 and 5 GeV/c particles, where the FW and BW
cases are indicated by the solid and dotted lines, respectively. The decrease in
So around θinc=50o is due to destructive correlation between θinc and θC, as
mentioned above. The So variation on the propagation length (L) is calculated
by varing the quartz length for θinc= 30o, 60o and 90o(FW), as shown in Fig.5.
At normal incidence, δ(TOP+TOF) becomes large relative to the eﬀects of (2)
and (3)′ as L increases, and, accordingly, So is improved. On the other hand,
at around θinc=30o the eﬀect (1) becomes large with L, and So decreases, as
can be seen in Fig.2(a) and (f).

3 Simulation Study

Based on the basic concepts considered in the preceeding section, we carried
out a simulation study on the realistic environment. Photons are generated
following to the Cherenkov spectrum (dN(λ)/dλ) convoluted by the quantum
eﬃciency QE(λ) of the phototube. The Cherenkov angle is determined by
using the λ-dependent quartz refractivity (n(λ)). The eﬀect of the quartz
thickness is naturally implemented in the simulation procedure. The eﬀective
TTS of the phototube is therefore set to be σTTS =75 ps, instead of the
previous value of 80 ps, including the ambiguity of only the timing reference
signal; this time resolution is considered in smearing the calculated TOP+TOF
values with a Gaussian of σ = σTTS. The phototube is assumed to detect only
the earliest photon if multi photons hit the same anode channel. The focussing
resolution is also included by smearing the calculated Φ-angle with a Gaussian

10

of σΦ = 0.5o as well. Digitizations of the arrival time and Φ-angle of photons
are made in 25 ps and 0.5o bins, respectively. All other treatments are the
same as in the previous calculation.

Φ

To display the various results for π and K tracks with the same momentum,
we set parameters (as an example, p=4 GeV/c and θinc = 90o) and require
to detect only FW photons, unless the conditions are speciﬁed. Figure 6(a)
shows a typical Φ-angle distribution of the number of detected photons for the
π track. The number of produced photons is 137 in total, while the detected
=45o are 33. The photons distribute rather uniformly
FW photons within
with an average of less than one per bin (∆Φ=0.5o). The TOP+TOF is shown
in Fig.6(b), where the circles and crosses are the detected photons radiated by
the π and K track, respectively. They form two slightly aymmetric parabola-
like distributions due to an inclined φinc-angle by a deﬂection eﬀect due to the
magnetic ﬁeld. It is 4.3o in this case. The dotted curves are the TOP+TOF
calculated in the previous section by disregarding the λ dependences and gen-
erating photons with θC=1/nβ (n=1.47). The upper two dotted curves in the
ﬁgure correspond to the calculated TOP+TOF for the BW photons.

|

|

The deviations of TOP+TOF for an incident π and K from the calculated
distribution assuming π, ∆(TOP+TOF)π/K(π), are presented in Fig.6(c). In
ﬁnding the deviation, two solutions exist at every Φ-angle due to the above-
mentioned deﬂection eﬀect, so that we choose the smaller deviation as the
correct one. The circles and closes are for photons emitted by a π and a K,
respectively. The former distributes around the null value, while the latter
shifts to the positive side, as expected.

|

Φ

The solid and dotted histograms in Fig.7 show the distribution of deviations,
45o, where α, β=π or K; also,
∆(TOP+TOF)α(β), for photons within
α is the particle species of the track and β is the particle species assumed.
The solid histogram presents the results under the correct assumption and the
dotted histogram presents those under an incorrect assignment. Figures 7(a)
and (b) show typical deviations for an event, and Figs.7(c) and (d) present the
results for the accumulation of 100 tracks. We obtain the probability function
(P (π/K)) by ﬁtting the results of the right assumption in Figs.7(c) and (d)
with Gaussian functions, as shown in the ﬁgures by the solid curves.

|≤

Based on this probability function, a log-likelihood (ln
) under the assump-
tion of π and K’s are calculated for 400 tracks each for incoming π and K.
Figure 8(a) shows a scatter plot of the log-likelihoods thus obtained in the case
of p=4 GeV/c and θinc= 90o for the FW photons; a clear separation between π

L

11

and K can be seen. The separability (S) is calculated by taking the diﬀerence
in the log-likelihood (∆ln
) between the two assumptions (see Fig.8(b)) and
using S=√2∆ln
; S=5.7 in this case. Thus, the calculated S’s for diﬀerent
p’s and θinc’s are indicated in Fig.9 for both FW and BW photons.

4 Discussion and Summary

We have shown that a high PID capability is attainable by using a (TOP,
Φ) measurement of the Cherenkov ring image. Although R&D is necessary,
especially, on a high-quality position-sensitive phototube operable in a mag-
netic ﬁeld and on an optimum focussing mirror, a good π/K separation is well
expected at the Belle barrel detector.

Some remarks are given below:

•

•

The development of a position-sensitive phototube is most important to
realize the separability so far presented. It has twofold issues. One is to
make it operable under a magnetic ﬁeld and we have being developed a
ﬁne-mesh-type multi-anode phototube for this purpose. The other is to re-
move or reduce the dead space dominated by the phototube package. The
phototube (R5900U-00-L16) has a surface size of 30 mm
30 mm in which
the sensitive area is 16 mm
16 mm, so that the eﬀective area at our R&D
counter becomes only about 40%. About half is in horizontal and 80% in
the vertical. The required size of the phototube is 20 mm
100 mm with a
bin step of 1 mm for detecting photons with

45o.

Adding the TOF information to the TOP information helps the PID, espe-
cially for low-momentum particles. However, for high-momentum particles
its eﬀect is not appreciable in our conﬁguration. For instance, at 4 GeV/c
tracks with θinc=90o, δ(TOF) are 23 ps, which is only about 1/3 of σTTS.
However, by setting a longer ﬂight-length (R), a sizable improvement can
be realized, as listed in Table 1; in such cases the TOP detector acts as a
kind of a high-resolution TOF counter by means of Cherenkov radiation,
since the Cherenkov-angle diﬀerence does not produce suﬃcient δ(TOP).

•

The π/K separability by the TOP measurement has an angular dependence,
as can be seen in Fig.9, while DIRC gives a more-or-less ﬂat distribution
with the incident angle. Especially, TOP shows a separability decrease at
50o, and it is in principle inevitable. On the other hand, TOP can
θinc

∼

12

•

•

give a larger S at normal incidence. Furthermore, in this case, TOP has the
merit of doubling S by detecting the both FW and BW going photons those
of which have an arrival time diﬀerence of about 20 ns, so that they can be
easily identiﬁed by using a multi-hit TDC with a high resolution.

One possible way to improve the separability for tracks with a large incident
angle is to equip an inclined surface, say, 45o to the reﬂection mirror at the
backward end. This will make the reclining Cherenkov ring image stand up
to the normal direction, so that it becomes a case close to a normal incidence
track and photons propagate the full bar length. Although an opposite ef-
90o, a rather suﬃcient TOP diﬀerence is
fect occurs for a track with θinc
produced by propagating a certain long distance before the photons arrive
at the reﬂection mirror. Optimization of the inclining angle of the reﬂection
mirror should be examined.

∼

Because the present design of the focussing mirror has a horizontally-extended
structure, it is not suitable as a barrel detector, and therefore we need to
ﬁnd a practical optical structure for the compact system. Although the ver-
tically conﬁgured mirror avoids this geometrical problem, the choise of the
horizontal conﬁguration is due to the fact that the TOP+TOF distribution
for the vertical conﬁguration has a larger diﬀerentiation to the angle Θ, as
shown in Fig.10, so that the TOP+TOF measurement uncertainty becomes
larger for an angle resolution of ∆Θ at the same accuracy as ∆Φ.

The simplest and practical solution for the above is to tilt the counter
around the z-axis by an angle of, for instance, 18.4o(=arctan(2 cm-thick/6
cm-width)) in our case, so that every mirror can avoid to interfere with each
other.

A TOP counter with a butterﬂy-shaped mirror, illustrated in Fig.1, has a
symmterical geometry with respect to the z-axis. By dividing the butterﬂy
mirror along the z-axis, a half butterﬂy-shaped counter can be constructable,
although the bar width also becomes half so as to have suﬃcient Φ-angle
resolution.

For simplicity of the calculation, the probability function (P(π/K)) is ob-
tained in the previous section from the whole ∆(TOP+TOF) distributions
=45o, while the spread of the distribution has the Φ-dependence.
within
Therefore, if we properly take account of this Φ-dependence in the probabil-
ity examination, better separability will be obtained. For instance, the rms
of the distribution varies from 85 ps to 140 ps within the accepted Φ-angle
region in the case of 4 GeV/c normal incident tracks.

We assumed the detection of only the earliest single photon at each photo-
tube anode in the previous section. It causes the loss of some photon frac-
110 detectable photons at θinc=30o,
tion. For instance, it is about 30% of
30 photons at θinc=60o and 90o, respec-
while it is about 10% of
tively.

It may be interesting to use a scintillator instead of the quartz material,
as mentioned at the beginning, although the situation is somewhat obscure
without a detailed study. Because of its ﬁnite decay-time and non-unique
photon emission-angle, the arrival-time distribution at individual Φ-angles
will spread. However, it is the usual situation at the ordinary TOF counter.
Since a large number of photons are provided in this case, when an optimized
conﬁguration is found to have a suﬃcient number of photons at each Φ/Θ-
segmentation, the TOF resolution could be improved by a factor of square-
root of the number of detection segments. Angular segmentation could be
arranged wider than our TOP case, so that the focussing mirror could be
smaller and the number of phototubes could be less. Needless to say, the
surface of the scintillator should be polished enough to allow photons to be
internally reﬂected.

Although the above-mentioned issues concerning the phototube and the mir-
ror structure remain, the proposed detector can be fully applicable as a PID
device for experiments under a non-magnetic enviornment, mostly for ﬁxed-
target experiments. At ﬁxed-target experiments, because incoming particles
are incident nearly normal to the detector, the maximum separation power
can be extracted.

With the use of a horizontal focussing mirror together with the fact that the
time ambiguity of Cherenkov radiation along the pass length is disregarded
compared with the phototube TTS, the cross section of the quartz radiator
does not have any eﬀects on TOP so that we can successfully avoid the un-
wanted image-fusing eﬀect.

The DIRC counter [2, 3, 4] veriﬁed that the Cherenkov image is well-transported
by internal total reﬂection, and the CCT counter [6, 7] exhibited that a time
measurement for such Cherenkov photons is feasible. While the TOP detecter
proposed here is based on a comprehensive compilation of the technical ver-
iﬁcation by those detecters, it can be used to exploit a new approach for
measuring the TOP and Φ-angle correlation by making use of the horizontal
focussing mirror. As a result, it would not only provide high particle identiﬁ-
cation ability, but also a more compact and ﬂexible detector compared with

14

the DIRC and the gas Cherenkov imaging detecter.

Fig.1: (a) Schematic structure of the TOP detector. The detector comprises
a quartz radiator-bar (20 mm-thick, 60 mm-wide, 3150 mm-long) and two
mirrors for focussing (the butterﬂy-shaped one at the forward end) and re-
ﬂecting (the ﬂat one at the backward end). The Cherenkov photons are
horizontally focussed onto the photon-detector plane, and their time and
angle information (TOP+TOF and Φ) are measured by position-sensitive
multi-channel phototubes. Figure (b) indicates the relation among the ba-
sic variables in the (x, y, z) coordinate system. θC is the Cherenkov angle.
OP indicates the particle trajectory, the direction of which is deﬁned by θinc
and φinc. OQ is the unit velocity vector of a Cherenkov photon, of which the
direction is deﬁned by Φ and Θ and its directional components are denoted
as qx, qy and qz.

and δ(TOP), with a momentum of 4 GeV/c and expected time uncertainties
from eﬀects (1), (2) and (3)′ for 7 diﬀerent conditions. Individual conditions
are indicated at the top of each ﬁgure. Especially, (a)-(e) correspond to the
condition that the particle produced at the colliding point with θinc ﬂies R=1
m under a 1.5 T magnetic ﬁeld and hit the TOP detector with the geometry
illustrated in Fig.1. The Cherenkov photon which propagates directly to the
forward(FW)/backward(BW) ends are considered to be detected separately.
The negative value of the δ(TOP) is plotted by the dotted curves in (a), (e)
and (f). Details are described in the text.

proximate numbers of detected photons are: 130 at θinc=30o, 39 at θinc=90o
for both FW and BW photons, and 76 at θinc=140o for p=4 GeV/c particles.

the results under the correct (incorrect) assumption of α = β (α

Tracks are assumed as β = π in (a) and (c), and as β=K in (b) and (d)
to calculate the expected TOP+TOF. (a) and (b) are for the single tracks,
while (c) and (d) are obtained by accumulating 100 tracks. Distributions
with the right hypothesis are used as the probability function P(π/K), whose
functional form is obtained by ﬁtting with Gaussian functions, as shown by
the solid and dotted curves in (c) and (d), respectively.

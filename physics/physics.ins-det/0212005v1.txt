Abstract

Measurements and numerical simulations on the charge transfer in Gas Electron
Multiplier (GEM) foils are presented and their implications for the usage of GEM
foils in Time Projection Chambers are discussed. A small test chamber has been
constructed and operated with up to three GEM foils. The charge transfer parame-
ters derived from the electrical currents monitored during the irradiation with an
55Fe source are compared with numerical simulations. The performance in magnetic
ﬁelds up to 2 T is also investigated.

1 Introduction

A Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is foreseen as the main tracker of the
detector for the TESLA linear collider [1]. It should provide a momentum
10−4(GeV/c)−1 to exploit especially the physics
resolution of δ(1/pt) < 2
of ﬁnal states with high energy leptons. Additionally the speciﬁc ionisation
dE/dx will be measured with a precision better than 5% to allow particle
identiﬁcation in hadronic jets.

To reach these goals readout planes with the ﬁnest possible granularity are
required. They must provide a single point resolution of 100 – 150 µm and their
systematic distortions must be controlled to better than 10 µm over the whole
radius of 1.6 m. Enough charge ampliﬁcation has to be provided by the system
to keep the signals well above the noise level of modern readout electronics. At
the same time the produced ions have to be suppressed intrinsically, because
active gating seems impossible in between a TESLA bunch spacing of only
337 ns. Finally one aims for a minimum of material in front of the calorimeters,
especially in the endcap region.

×

A conventional TPC using a multi wire plane for charge ampliﬁcation is limited
by the ~E
~B eﬀects in the region close to the wires. In strong magnetic ﬁelds
these eﬀects result in a broadening of the electron cloud and a worsening
of the resolution. Additionally, as the wires deﬁne a preferred direction, the
reconstructed hit location depends on the projected angle between track and
wires. The readout is done via pads which detect the induced signals from the
wires. This induced signal is broader than the cloud of arriving electrons and
limits the granularity of the TPC as well as the double track resolution.

Using Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) [2] as the charge amplifying system
could solve some of the drawbacks of wire planes. A GEM consists of a polymer
foil about 50 µm thick and metal coated on both sides. It is perforated by a
high density of small holes with diameters of typically 50 – 100 µm. Voltages
up to 500 V between the two conducting sides generate high electric ﬁelds
in the order of 80 kV/cm inside the holes where the gas ampliﬁcation of the
drifting electrons occurs. When using GEM structures for the TPC end plate,
the pads directly detect the ampliﬁed electron cloud which results in a fast
and narrow charge signal. Also the slow ion tail is cut oﬀ since the ion cloud
does not reach the induction region. A GEM foil shows no preferred direction,
thus any ~E
~B eﬀects will be isotropic. And ﬁnally, using highly diﬀerent
electric ﬁelds in front and behind the GEM, the back drift of ions produced
inside the GEM holes (ion feedback) can be largely suppressed.

×

To demonstrate the advantages of a TPC with GEM readout a prototype
chamber will be built within the R&D activities of the linear collider TPC
group [6]. It will be used to investigate wether the momentum accuracy, the
double track resolution and the quality of the dE/dx measurement as de-
manded for a detector at TESLA can be reached. The end plates of this
prototype will contain up to three planes of charge amplifying GEM foils. The
operation conditions of this multi GEM structure should be optimised before-
hand, because in the case of three GEM planes six electric ﬁelds have to be
set. Therefore, a small test stand was set up at the RWTH Aachen.

The optimisation of a TPC readout plane should be done with respect to three
important parameters:

The electron transparency, Telec, i.e. the fraction of primary ionisation that
experiences multiplication, should be near to 100%.
The eﬀective gain, Geﬀ, i. e. the number of electrons reaching the anode
pads per primary electron, should be suﬃciently high.
The ion feedback, Bion, i. e. the fraction of ions that reach the cathode plane,
should be at a minimum.

To study the charge transfer mechanism of GEM structures we ﬁrst introduce
the following variables for a single GEM foil:

The collection eﬃciency, C −(+), i.e. the fraction of electrons (ions) collected
into the GEM holes per number of electrons (ions) arriving.
The gain, G, i.e. the factor by which the number of electrons is increased
by gas multiplication inside the GEM holes
The extraction eﬃciency, X −(+), i.e. the fraction of electrons (ions) ex-
tracted from the GEM holes into the drift volume per number of electrons
(ions) produced in the holes.
The secondary extraction eﬃciency, X +
sec, i.e. the fraction of ions extracted
from the GEM holes into the drift volume per number of ions which had
been collected into the holes. This is diﬀerent from the primary extraction,
X +, as will become clear in Section 4.

These transfer coeﬃcients have been determined as a function of the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds by measuring the various currents that appear on the
electrodes of the GEM structure. Numerical simulations of the electric ﬁeld
ﬂuxes allowed us to predict these variables and to compare the prediction
with measurements. Additionally a parametrisation of the simulation has been
established which can be used in future to optimize the working point of the
GEM structure with respect to ion feedback and transparency.

2 The Test Chamber

2.1 Mechanical Setup

The test chamber is built on a PC board which is used as the anode plane.
The sensitive area consists of a solid copper electrode of the same size as the
10 cm2). A bolt made from non conducting material
GEM structures (10
is ﬁxed in each of the four corners This allows the mounting of up to three
GEM foils glued on frames with corresponding holes. The distances between
the GEM foils (typically 2 mm) can be set by spacers. On top of the last GEM
the cathode, consisting of a ﬁne metal mesh, is ﬁxed in the same way as the
GEMs. The gas volume is closed by a composite frame to the sides. On top it

Fig. 1. The test chamber used for the measurements

is covered by a 24 µm thick mylar foil which allows the photons from an 55Fe
source to penetrate into the chamber.

The chamber has been operated alternatively with Ar/CO2 82/18 for the
measurements without a magnetic ﬁeld (Section 4) or with Ar/CH4 95/5 for
the magnet tests at a rate of 2-6 l/h (Section 5). It was irradiated from the
top by an 55Fe source with an activity of the order of 100 MBq.

2.2 Electric Setup

Each electrode (GEM surfaces and cathode) is connected to an individual
channel of a CAEN SY127 HV power supply, allowing the ﬂexible setting of
all electric ﬁelds and GEM voltages. Nano-Amperemeters [3], constructed in
our electronics workshop and providing a resolution of approximately 0.1 nA,
are inserted in the supply line of each HV channel. To measure the anode
current, all pads and the surrounding copper are connected to ground via an
individual nanoamperemeter. The high voltage control and current readout
are handled by a custom application running on a Linux system.

2.3 Analysis

In Section 1, the charge transfer coeﬃcients are deﬁned as ratios of charges.
We use the corresponding currents, as charges are produced and transferred
continuously. These currents of drifting electrons and Ions (ID, IT,n, IHole,n and
II in Figure 3) cannot be measured directly, but have to be calculated from
the currents transferred on the electrodes (IC, IGEM,n,C/A, IA). The fact that
every current has an electron and an ion component must be considered when
calculating transfer coeﬃcients for electrons or ions separately. Depending on
the individual setup and coeﬃcient, this can become quite complex. Details
are described in [4].

As an example, consider the electron extraction eﬃciency for GEM3. It is
deﬁned as the fraction of electrons extracted from the GEM holes into the
induction region per number of electrons produced in the holes, and can be

This is a simple case, because in the region below GEM3 only electrons exist.

3 Numerical Simulations and Parametrisations

The numerical simulations are performed using the ﬁnite element program
Maxwell 3D of Ansoft Co. [9]. It allows to solve the Maxwell equations in
three dimensional problems. For the simulation of the electric ﬁelds inside and
between the GEM structures only the electrostatic problem solver is needed.

First the geometry of a unit cell of the GEM is constructed with the CAD
part of the program. Material properties are assigned to the geometrical ob-
jects using the provided database. Above and below the GEM foil 200 µm of
material-free drift ﬁeld are added to the model. Then electric potentials are
assigned to each conducting plane. The boundary conditions at the border of
the simulated unit cell are chosen such that the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the

6

Fig. 4. Coarse ﬁnite element mesh generated with Maxwell 3D

border planes (Neumann boundaries).

Maxwell generates the ﬁnite element mesh by dividing the model volume into
small tetrahedrons. The mesh can be reﬁned in critical regions like sharp
edges for example. The electric potential is calculated at each knot and each
centre of the connection lines of the mesh by solving the Poisson equation
numerically. Inside the tetrahedrons the potential is interpolated by a second
order polynomial.

After a numerical solution has been found, it can be visualized using the post
processor. For example, ﬁeld vectors or potential lines can be drawn, but also
further calculations can be applied to the solution found. Especially mean
electric ﬁelds or the electric ﬂux through diﬀerent areas is used extensively
throughout this analysis. For details of the simulation studies, see [5].

3.1 Electric ﬁeld inside the GEM hole

One of the most important parameters of a GEM structure is the mean electric
ﬁeld inside the GEM hole, Ehole. We deﬁne this parameter from the integral
of the electric ﬁeld over the area of the hole centre, A (~n is its normal vector):

Ehole = RA

~n d2r

~E
·
RA d2r

(1)

The calculated ﬁeld depends on the used GEM geometry, the voltage across the
GEM foil and the electric ﬁelds of the drift regions above and below the GEM,

3.2 Electric ﬁeld ﬂux and charge transfer coeﬃcients

Neglecting diﬀusion eﬀects across the GEM structure and assuming zero mag-
netic ﬁeld, all charges (electrons and ions) will follow the electric ﬁeld lines. It is
also assumed that during gas multiplication charges are spread homogeneously
across the complete cross section of the GEM hole. In this approximation it
is possible to calculate the charge transfer coeﬃcients from the electric ﬁeld
ﬂux.

Figure 6 shows a schematic plot of the electric ﬂux through a GEM hole. The
total ﬂux coming from the anode Φanode and the ﬂux going to the cathode
Φcathode can be calculated from a surface integral over the electric ﬁeld at the
bottom and top of the GEM model, respectively. The total ﬂux through the
GEM hole is again the ﬂux integral over the area of the hole centre.

8

Fig. 6. Model of the electric ﬂux for one GEM hole in an asymmetric ﬁeld conﬁgu-
ration. (Diﬀerent electric ﬁelds above and below the GEM foil.)

Furthermore, the electric ﬂux can be separated into contributions from distinct
regions illustrated by diﬀerent shades in Figure 6. There are the ﬂuxes ΦC and
ΦA which go directly from the electrodes to the copper planes of the GEM. The
direction of the electric ﬁeld changes between region ΦC and R and between ΦA
and Z. Therefore ΦC and ΦA can be extracted by a numerical integration over
that part of the copper plane, where the electric ﬁeld is pointing upwards. The
electric ﬂux D which goes from one electrode through the GEM hole directly
to the other electrode, the ﬂux R from the anode through the hole onto the
top side of the GEM surface and the ﬂux Z going from the lower to the upper
GEM surface cannot be calculated directly.

The collection eﬃciency C is the fraction of the external ﬂux that is collected
into the GEM hole:

Fig. 7. Simulation of the extraction eﬃciency X and collection eﬃciency C for
several GEM voltages, UGEM as a function of the ratio of external and hole ﬁeld

Equations 3 and 4 suggest that the collection eﬃciency C and extraction
eﬃciency X both vary with the ratio between the external ﬂux and the ﬂux
through the GEM hole. This is shown in Figure 7, where the simulation results
for both coeﬃcients are plotted versus the ratio Eext/Ehole. Diﬀerent markers
show simulation results with diﬀerent GEM voltages ranging from 300 V to
500 V.

From the ﬁeld ﬂux model also a relation between the collection and the extrac-
tion eﬃciency can be derived. Let Φext be the ﬂux onto an external electrode
(anode or cathode) of size Aext. As the electrode is far away from the GEM
structure one can assume a homogeneous electric ﬁeld and the external ﬁeld
strength is given by

Eext =

Φext
Aext

.

(5)

10

On the other hand, using the mean electric ﬁeld inside the GEM hole Ehole as
deﬁned in Formula 1 one can write the total electric ﬂux through the GEM
hole as

Φhole = Ehole ·

Ahole .

Therefore, the ratio between extraction eﬃciency X and collection eﬃciency
C is a linear function of the ratio between external and hole ﬁeld,

where the only geometrical parameter Topt is the optical transparency of the

Figure 8 shows the predicted linear dependence between the ratio X/C and the
ﬁeld ratio Eext/Ehole calculated for diﬀerent GEM geometries. Six diﬀerent ge-
ometries describing holes with diﬀerent sizes and diﬀerent shapes (conical and
cylindrical) have been simulated. Geometries with equal optical transparency
show the same slope.

4 Measurement Results and Comparison with Simulation

Figures 10 through 13 show the comparison between measurements made with
the test chamber (Section 2) and the parametrisation obtained from the elec-
trostatic simulations (Section 3).

All data except for the electron collection eﬃciency follow the simulation.
That shows that those coeﬃcients are governed mostly by the electrostatic
conditions in the chamber, not by gas eﬀects such as diﬀusion. This assumption
is also supported by the fact that the extraction eﬃciencies for electrons and
ions are equal within their errors.

For the measured collection eﬃciency of both electrons and ions, there is a
steep decrease for ﬁeld ratios approaching x = 0 while the simulation remains
constant at C = 1. We believe that this eﬀect is due to recombination of charge
pairs at very low drift velocities caused by the small electric ﬁeld in the drift
region. In contrast, while showing a plateau of C = 1 up to the same ﬁeld ratio
as the simulation, the collection eﬃciency for electrons decreases signiﬁcantly
steeper after that point. The origin of this eﬀect is not yet understood.

The remaining diﬀerence between measurement and simulation for these vari-
ables is partly a consequence of the discrepancies between the ideal geometry of
the GEM model in the simulations and the real GEMs. For example, changing
the shape of the edges of the holes in the GEMs copper plating from perpendic-
ular to the inclination of the conical holes in the polyimide causes a variation
in the simulation results of the same order as the discussed diﬀerences.

The signiﬁcant diﬀerence between primary and secondary ion extraction which
does not occur for electrons, can be explained as follows: Through gas multi-
plication electrons are spread homogeneously across the cross section of every
GEM hole they enter. Therefore a fraction of the electrons always occupies the
radially outer regions of the hole penetrated by ﬁeld lines ending on the top
of the GEM and so decreasing the extraction eﬃciency. Primary ion extrac-
tion occurs through the same mechanism and shows the same values (compare
Figures 10 and 12). However, ions subsequently collected into another GEM
enter the hole in the middle, and because no multiplication and little dif-
fusion occurs, they mostly remain on ﬁeld lines continuing to the following
GEM or electrode. This leads to the increased secondary extraction eﬃciency
observed (Figure 12). Understanding these processes, calculations from elec-
trostatic simulations describe even the eﬀect of secondary extraction by taking
the electric ﬂux entering the GEM hole into account (Figure 6, 12).

5 Eﬀect of a Magnetic Field

Our primary motivation for making tests in a magnet was to investigate
whether there is a signiﬁcant drop in collection eﬃciency for GEMs in high
B-ﬁelds parallel to the electric ﬁelds as suggested by the Langevin Formula

~vDrif t ∝

ˆ~E + ωτ (

ˆ~E

ˆ~B) + ω2τ 2 (

5.1 Simulation

The last term proportional to B2, which gives the contribution along the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines, could cause a drop in collection eﬃciency for high magnetic
ﬁelds. When this term dominates, most electrons will no longer be collected
into a GEM hole but will stay on drift lines perpendicular to the GEM surface
and eventually reach the GEMs copper coating. Those charges will be lost for
the signal and consequently decrease the chamber’s dE/dx capabilities due to
the loss in primary ionisation statistics.

To get a ﬁrst qualitative view of the electrons behaviour, we calculated drift
lines in the vicinity of a GEM foil pervaded by a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld. This was
done using the simulation program Garﬁeld [11] which allows to take gas and
magnetic ﬁeld into account. We use a three dimensional electric ﬁeld map of
a GEM at 400 V with an external ﬁeld of 200 V/cm obtained with Maxwell
(see Section 3). The gas mixture selected was Ar/CH4 95/5 which is close to
the mixture of Ar/CO2/CH4 93/2/5 proposed in the TESLA Technical Design
Report [1]. Each of the shown drift lines starts at a virtual straight ionisation
track consisting of equally spaced electrons.

In Figure 14 the eﬀect of the Lorentz term is well visible for electrons: they
follow a track spiraling into the GEM hole. In contrast there is no contribution
to the drift velocity along the magnetic ﬁeld lines. Hence we have no indication
for a signiﬁcant drop in the collection eﬃciency for primary electrons.

5.2 Measurements

For a quantitative analysis, we have conducted a series of current measure-
ments with our test chamber in a non superconducting magnet limited to a
maximum ﬁeld of 2 T. All tests were performed with a magnetic ﬁeld parallel
to the electric ﬁelds in the chamber.

For the test described here, we choose an electric ﬁeld setup of 200 V/cm
in the drift ﬁeld, 5000 V/cm in the induction ﬁeld and 2500 V/cm in the
remaining ﬁelds. Each GEM is operated at a voltage of 310 V. The low drift
ﬁeld resembles the conﬁguration in a TPC. The gas chosen is Ar/CH4 95/5,
the same as in the Garﬁeld simulation.

Opposite to the expected drop in collection eﬃciency, the signal current on the
anode increases with B. At 2 T, it is approximately 6% higher than without

Fig. 15. Measured anode current as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld

a magnetic ﬁeld. Though surprising, this result is still compatible with a de-
creasing collection as anticipated but being dominated by a rise in extraction
eﬃciency or gas gain.

To ﬁnd out about the mechanism for the observed rise in signal, another
measurement was taken. The chamber was operated with all GEMs at 330 V
and all ﬁelds at 1 kV/cm. This setting does not resemble the setting in a TPC
(low drift ﬁeld), but is chosen to allow simpler analysis of the charge transfer
properties of the GEMs (same conditions at all GEMs, periodic setup): Because
of the identical electrostatic conditions at all GEMs the corresponding transfer
coeﬃcients are equal and the signal current on the anode can be expressed as

with IP being the current of primary ionisation by the photons from the 55Fe
source.

Figure 16 shows the anode current normalised to its value at B = 0. As before,
it shows an increase with the magnetic ﬁeld, this time by approximately 15%

Fig. 16. Anode current vs. magnetic ﬁeld for the periodic setup

at 2 T. So obviously the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld on the signal current is
dependent on the electrostatic chamber setup.

From the currents in the chamber recorded during the measurement the ex-
traction eﬃciency of GEM3, XGEM 3, was calculated. As discussed above, it
is the same as for the two other GEMs, XGEM 3 = XGEM . The squares in
Figure 16 show the values of X 3
GEM , again normalised to their value at B = 0.
The increase is even greater than that of the anode current (approximately
20%), which means that the product C 3
GEM must have decreased. Di-
viding the relative signal current by the calculated X 3
GEM yields the value of
C 3

GEM , which is plotted as stars.

Obviously, the rise in the anode current is caused by an improved extraction
eﬃciency for high magnetic ﬁelds. A drop in collection eﬃciency is hardly
visible (note that for a single GEM, the eﬀect is approximately 3√95%
98%
which is not signiﬁcant taking the error of the measurement into account).

This result proves that the operation of triple GEM structures in a 2 T
magnetic ﬁeld is possible; for higher ﬁelds, corresponding measurements are
scheduled.

6 Conclusions

It has been shown that the charge transfer coeﬃcients of single GEM foils
are predominantly determined by electrostatic conditions. Within the errors
the results from measurements of the electric currents in the GEM structure
are in agreement with simulations of the electric ﬂux. The charge transfer
coeﬃcients can be described by a set of simple parametrisations which match
the simulation almost identically.

A diﬀerence has been found between the extraction eﬃciencies of ions out
of GEM holes where they were produced by gas multiplication (primary ex-
traction) and out of GEM holes into which the ions were collected (secondary
extraction). Electrons do not show this behavior, because they always experi-
ence multiplication in GEM holes (assuming a suﬃciently large electric ﬁeld)
and are therefore distributed homogeneously across the volume of a GEM hole.

It has been demonstrated that for the working conditions in a TPC with low
external ﬁeld (the TPC drift ﬁeld) and high electric ﬁeld inside the GEM
holes the ion feedback is intrinsically reduced to the percent level keeping
full transparency for primary electrons. More sophisticated analysis of our
parametrisation should allow to ﬁnd an optimal ﬁeld conﬁguration of the GEM
structure.

Applying a magnetic ﬁeld up to 2 T perpendicular to the surface of a triple
GEM structure does not result in a decrease of the eﬀective gain. Further
studies are needed to understand the quantitative behaviour of the electron
collection eﬃciency in magnetic ﬁelds up to 4 T.

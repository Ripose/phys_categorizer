Abstract

The development of the NEMO 3 detector, which is now running in the Fr´ejus Underground Laboratory
(L.S.M. Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane), was begun more than ten years ago. The NEMO 3 detector
uses a tracking-calorimeter technique in order to investigate double beta decay processes for several
isotopes. The technical description of the detector is followed by the presentation of its performance.

1 Introduction

1.1 Objective of the experiment

The primary objective of the NEMO 3 experiment is to search for neutrinoless double beta decay
for several isotopes. This research is one of the most pressing topics in neutrino physics, for which
there is the fundamental problem of whether or not neutrinos are massless. If double beta decay
without neutrino emission, ββ0ν, is observed the neutrino can be a massive Majorana particle,
which is its own antiparticle.

It was proposed years ago [1] that there could be an exchange of neutrinos between two neutrons
in the same nucleus leading to the emission of two electrons and no neutrinos. The Majorana
A interaction. The observation of the ββ0ν
mass term enables such a transition through a V
process would then prove the Majorana nature of the neutrino.

−

It is also possible to investigate ββ0ν transitions to the 2+ excited state, which involves a Majo-
rana mass term through the V + A interaction. Other mechanisms may contribute to the ββ0ν
process, in particular the emission of a Majoron M 0, the boson associated with spontaneous
symmetry breaking of lepton number. The search for the ββM 0 process involves a three body
decay spectrum with the Majoron avoiding detection, which imposes additional constraints on
the design of the detector. The objective of the NEMO 3 experiment (Neutrino Ettore Majorana
Observatory) is to investigate these three decay modes to further the understanding of double
beta decay.

In all double beta decays, which are second order weak interactions, nuclei decay into daughter
nuclei by emitting two electrons accompanied by two undetected neutrinos. This is the ββ2ν
process which has already been observed for 10 isotopes: 48Ca, 76Ge, 82Se, 96Zr, 100Mo, 116Cd,
128Te, 130Te, 150Nd and 238U (see [2] for a review article).

The NEMO 3 experiment aims to search for the eﬀective Majorana neutrino down to a mass
mνi
at the level of 0.1 eV. If only a limit is reached on the ββ0ν half-life, an upper limit on
mνi
can be inferred from the relation

where G0ν is the phase-space factor that is analytically calculated and proportional to the tran-
sition energy to the ﬁfth power, Q5
ββ. M0ν is the nuclear matrix element of the relevant isotope
for which calculations have large theoretical uncertainties. Given the uncertainty in M0ν, a mass
limit of 0.1 eV corresponds to a neutrinoless double beta decay with a half-life limit of the or-
der of 1025 years for 100Mo. To improve the sensitivity of a double beta decay experiment it is
preferable to study an isotope with a large Qββ, not only to get a larger G0ν, but also to reduce
the background in the search for a ββ0ν signal.

Measurements of a half-life as long as 1025 years is challenging. It requires a solid understanding
of natural and cosmogenic radioactive backgrounds in the materials from which the detector
is made and backgrounds induced by the radioactivity from the walls and atmosphere in the
underground laboratory. Two prototypes, NEMO 1 [3] and NEMO 2 [4], were constructed and

run to demonstrate the feasibility of the experimental technique. The development of NEMO 3
was begun more than ten years ago [5]. It reﬂects a more than 10-fold enhancement on the
NEMO 2 sensitivity in order to measure the double beta decay half-life limits of 1025 yr for the
ββ0ν process, 1023 yr for the ββM 0 process, and 1022 yr for the ββ2ν process.

1.2 General description of the NEMO 3 detector

The philosophy behind NEMO 3 is the direct detection of the two electrons from ββ decay
by a tracking device and a calorimeter. The NEMO 3 detector, for which the general layout is
shown in Fig. 1, is similar in function to the earlier prototype detector, NEMO 2, but has lower
radioactivity and is able to accommodate up to 10 kg of double beta decay isotopes.

Fig. 1. An exploded view of the NEMO 3 detector. Note the coil, iron γ-ray shield, and the two diﬀerent
types of neutron shields, composed of water tanks and wood. The paraﬃn shield under the central tower
is not shown on the picture.

The NEMO 3 detector is now installed in the Fr´ejus Underground Laboratory (LSM 1 ) in France.
It is cylindrical in design and divided into 20 equal sectors, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The
segmentation permits easy access to a patchwork of source foils of the diﬀerent isotopes. This
60 mg/cm2
patchwork is also cylindrical in form. It is 3.1 m in diameter, 2.5 m in height and 30
thick.

The Geiger cells are located between the internal and external walls. L4, L3,... IN identify diﬀerent
shapes of scintillator blocks. A petal (end-cap) is also shown with the “4-2-3” layer conﬁguration for
the Geiger cells.

The source foils are ﬁxed vertically between two concentric cylindrical tracking volumes composed
of 6180 open octagonal drift cells. The drift cells are 270 cm long, operating in Geiger mode at 7
mbar above atmospheric pressure, with a partial pressure of 40 mbar of ethyl alcohol in a mixture
with helium gas. The cells run vertically and three-dimensional tracking is accomplished with
the arrival time of the signals on the anode wires and the plasma propagation times to the ends
of the drift cells.

Energy and time-of-ﬂight measurements are acquired from plastic scintillators covering the two
vertical surfaces of the active tracking volume. To further enhance the acceptance eﬃciency, the
end-caps (the top and bottom of the detector) are also equipped with scintillators in the spaces
between the drift cell layers. This calorimeter is made of 1940 large blocks of scintillators coupled
to very low radioactivity 3” or 5” photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). The 10 cm thick blocks of
scintillator yield a high photon detection eﬃciency. Fig. 4 shows a picture of one sector of the
NEMO 3 detector.

Fig. 4. View of the third sector in the source mounting room just after the installation of the tellurium
source.

A solenoid surrounding the detector produces a 25 Gauss magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the foil axis,
in order to identify the particle charge. Pairs (e+e−) are produced in the source foils in the 1 to
10 MeV region by high-energy γ-rays from neutron capture. The curvature measurements also
permit an eﬃcient rejection of incoming electrons.

Finally, an external shield, in the form of 20 cm of low radioactivity iron, covers the detector
to reduce γ-rays and thermal neutrons. Outside of this iron there is a borated water shield to
thermalize fast neutrons and capture thermal neutrons.

In the NEMO 3 detector, electrons, positrons, photons and α-particles can be identiﬁed. Thus, the
detector is able to detect multi-particle events in the low energy domain of natural radioactivity.

1.3 Background of the experiment

The most signiﬁcant concern in this double beta decay experiment is the background. The
calorimeter measures the energy of the two electrons emitted from a common vertex in the
source foil. The energy region of interest for the ββ0ν signal is around 3 MeV (Qββ(100Mo) =
3.034 MeV and Qββ(82Se) = 2.995 MeV [6]). This energy region is shared by some energetic
natural radioactivity, which can produce two electrons in the source which mimic ββ0ν decays.
The key to the success of the experiment is to be able to positively identify these background
events with high eﬃciency.

1.3.1 Natural radioactivity decay chains and other radioactive isotopes

In general, natural radioactivity coming from very long half-life isotopes such as potassium (K),
uranium (U) and thorium (Th) needs to be carefully monitored. The decay chain for 235U is not
108 yr its natural isotopic abundance
taken into account, because even though the half-life is 7.04
is only 0.7% and its decay chain daughter nuclei do not generate enough energy to mimic the
ββ0ν signal. Concerning 40K, the energy range of these decays is again not a background concern
for the ββ0ν’s signal.

×

From the natural decay chains of 238U and 232Th, only 214Bi and 208Tl are β-decay isotopes
with Qβ greater than 3 MeV (with respective Qβ values of 3.270 and 4.992 MeV, and respective
half-lives of 19.9 and 3.05 minutes [7]). Thus, 214Bi and 208Tl produce γ-rays and electrons that
are energetic enough to simulate ββ0ν events at 3 MeV (energies and intensities of γ-rays from
natural radioactivity decay chains of 238U and 232Th can be found in Ref. [8]). The most energetic
γ-rays are from 208Tl (2.615 MeV) for which the branching ratio is 36%.

Radon (222Rn, T1/2 = 3.824 days) and thoron (220Rn, T1/2 = 55.6 s) are α-decay isotopes, which
have 214Bi and 208Tl as daughter isotopes respectively. Coming mainly from the rocks and present
in the air, the 222Rn and 220Rn are very diﬀusion prone rare gases which can enter the detector.
Subsequent α-decays of these gases give 218Po and 216Po respectively, which can contaminate the
interior of the detector.

1.3.2 External and internal backgrounds

When describing the background, it is convenient to distinguish between the “internal” and
“external” sources. The internal backgrounds come from radioactive contaminants inside the
ββ source foil, while external backgrounds come from radioactive contaminants outside the ββ
source foils, which interact with the detector.

The internal background for the ββ0ν signal in the 3 MeV region has two origins. The ﬁrst is the
tail of the ββ2ν decay distribution of the source, which cannot be separated from the ββ0ν signal
and the level of overlap depends on the energy resolution of the detector. Thus, this ultimately
deﬁnes the half-life limits to which ββ0ν can be searched for. The second background comes from

the β-decays of 214Bi and 208Tl, which are present in the source at some level. They can mimic ββ
events by three mechanisms. These are β-decay accompanied by an electron conversion process,
M¨oller scattering of β-decay electrons in the source foil and β-decay emission to an excited state
followed by a Compton scattered γ-ray. The last mechanism can be detected as two electron
events if the γ-ray is not detected. Thus, the experiment requires ultra-pure source foils. The
maximum levels of impurities in the source have been calculated so as to produce fewer events
than the tail of the ββ2ν decay gives in the region of interest for ββ0ν.

The external background is deﬁned as events produced by γ-ray sources located outside the
source foils and interacting with them. The interaction of γ-rays in the foils can lead to two
electron-like events by e+e− pair creation, double Compton scattering or Compton followed
by M¨oller scattering. One of the main sources of this external radioactivity comes from the
PMTs, but there are other sources too, such as cosmic rays, radon and neutrons. To decrease the
background for the NEMO 3 detector it was placed at a depth of 4800 m water equivalent, where
cosmic ray ﬂuxes have been found to be negligible. Two shields and a magnetic ﬁeld suppress
the backgrounds from γ-rays and neutrons. The vigorous air ventilation system in the laboratory
reduces radon levels down to 10-20 Bq/m3. All the materials used in the detector have been
selected for their radiopurity properties and in particular, a substantial eﬀort has been made to
reduce the contamination of the PMTs from 40K, 214Bi and 208Tl.

Consequently, in the construction of the NEMO 3 experiment every attempt has been made to
minimize internal and external backgrounds by puriﬁcation of the enriched isotope samples and
by carefully selecting all the detector materials. As it was shown with the NEMO 2 prototype,
the NEMO 3 detector will be able to characterize and measure its own background.

2 Technical design of the NEMO 3 detector

2.1 The NEMO 3 sources

2.1.1 Introduction

The primary design feature of the NEMO 3 experiment was to have the detector and the source
of the double beta decay independent, unlike the case of the 76Ge experiments. This permits one
to study several double beta decay isotopes, a critical point is to be able to conﬁrm an excess
of ββ0ν events from one isotope with another isotope. It also reduces the dependence of the
interpretation of the result on the nuclear matrix elements. Furthermore, a rich study of the
backgrounds and systematic eﬀects is possible.

The choice of which nuclei to study was aﬀected by several parameters. These include the tran-
sition energy (Qββ), the nuclear matrix elements (M0ν and M2ν) of the transitions for ββ0ν and
ββ2ν decays, the background in the energy region surrounding the Qββ value, the possibility
of reducing the radioactivity of the isotope studied to acceptable levels, and ﬁnally the natural
isotopic abundance of the candidate. Basing the choice singularly on M0ν is not advisable be-
cause the calculations are too uncertain. A good criterion for isotope selection is the Qββ value
with respect to backgrounds. As explained in Section 1.3, the 2.615 MeV γ-ray produced in the
decay of 208Tl is consistently a troublesome source of background and it is important to select

ββ candidates with a Qββ value above this transition. The natural isotopic abundance is another
useful criterion because in general the higher the abundance the easier the enrichment process.
Typically only isotopic abundances greater than 2% were considered. Five nuclei satisfy these
two criteria: 116Cd , 82Se, 100Mo, 96Zr and 150Nd (with respective Qββ values of 2804.7, 2995.2,
3034.8, 3350.0 and 3367.1 keV and respective isotope abundance values of 7.5, 9.2, 9.6, 2.8 and
5.6% [6]). Given this list and the availability of 100Mo, much eﬀort has been focused by the
NEMO collaboration on this isotope (it had already been studied by the NEMO 2 prototype [9]).
However the focus is not exclusively on 100Mo, in view of the fact that the detector can house
several diﬀerent sources.

There have been improvements in the isotopic enrichment processing in Russia, where all the
double beta decay sources were produced. Thus the 48Ca isotope has been added to the list of
interesting sources. Note that 48Ca fails to meet the abundance selection criterion but has an
impressive Qββ value (Qββ = 4272.0 keV and isotope abundance of 0.187% [6]). Finally, 130Te
(with Qββ value of 2528.9 keV and isotope abundance of 33.8% [6]) has been added for ββ2ν
studies. Historically, 130Te has had two diﬀerent geochemical half-life measurements [10,11], which
are inconsistent with each other and a reliable one is sought here.

A description of the current population of the 20 sectors of NEMO 3 follows. To study the ββ0ν
processes 6914 g of 100Mo and 932 g of 82Se are housed in twelve and two sectors respectively.
The objective here is to reach a sensitivity for the eﬀective neutrino mass on the order of 0.1 eV.
Several other ββ decay isotopes in smaller quantities have been introduced to study the ββ2ν
processes which will complement the very detailed studies provided by the 100Mo and 82Se on
angular distributions and single electron energy spectra. This second tier of isotope samples
consists of 454 g of 130Te (2 sectors), 405 g of 116Cd (1 sector), 37 g of 150Nd, 9 g of 96Zr and 7 g
of 48Ca. Finally, source foils with high levels of radiopurity, so they are eﬀectively void of internal
backgrounds, will measure the external background in the experiment. This not only accounts
for the presence of 621 g of copper but also a very pure oxide of natural tellurium, which permits
one to study the background near 3 MeV. This natural tellurium also provides an investigation
of the ββ2ν because the natural abundance of isotope 130 for tellurium is 33.8%, which gives
166 g of 130Te.

For each sector, a source frame was constructed on which were placed seven strips. The mean
length of the strips is 2480 mm with a width of 63 mm if they are on the edges of the frame or
65 mm for the ﬁve strips in the middle of the frame. All the strips are attached to the frames in a
clean room at the LSM where they are then introduced into the sectors. The so-called “NEMO 3
camembert” depicts the distribution of the sources in the 20 sectors, Fig. 5.

The thickness of the source foils was chosen to take into account the energy resolution, which is
ﬁxed by the calorimeter design. The detector eﬃciency for the ββ0ν process is not compromised
as long as the surface densities of the foils do not exceed 60 mg/cm2. As a consequence the
source foils have surface densities between 30 and 60 mg/cm2, which means a thickness lower
10 g/cm3) and lower than 300 µm for composite
than 60 µm for the metallic foils (density of
foils (density of

2 g/cm3).

As indicated above, NEMO 3 sources are metallic or composite. Cadmium, copper and a fraction
of the molybdenum foils are metallic sources. Composite foils are a mixture of source powder and
organic glue. For the 100Mo 64% are in the form of composite strips. The selenium, tellurium,
zirconium, neodymium and calcium foils are all composite foils.

Fig. 5. The source distribution in the 20 sectors of NEMO 3.

For composite foils, the glue is made from water and some percentage of PVA (polyvinyl alco-
hol). This mixture is laid down on a Mylar sheet and then covered by another sheet forming a
sandwich-like structure. These sheets are often referred to as backing ﬁlms, which provide me-
chanical rigidity. The Mylar sheets have undergone a special processing in which a large number
of microscopic holes (around 0.4 µm in diameter) have been created to insure a good bond with
the glue. The holes are made ﬁrst by irradiating the Mylar at JINR with a 84Kr ion beam of
1011 ions/s. Nearly 30% of the backing ﬁlm surface
3 MeV/nucleon and a luminosity of around 5
is aﬀected by the ion tracks. The next step in preparing the ﬁlm is chemically etching it with
NaOH (5 M) at 70o C, then the ﬁlm is washed with water and 1% of CH3COOH (acetic acid)
and ﬁnally dried with hot air. There are three types of backing ﬁlm used in the experiment.
107 holes/cm2. Type 2 has a thickness of 19 µm
Type 1 has a thickness of 18 µm and around 7
×
107 holes/cm2.
107 holes/cm2. Type 3, which is 23 µm thick, has around 7
and around 2
All the products (Mylar, water, acid...) used to process the backing ﬁlm have been selected for
their radiopurity with High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector measurements at the LSM (the
HPGe detectors are from Eurisys Mesures Company). The characteristics of all the source foils’
strips in the 20 sectors are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

2.1.2 Radiopurity of the sources with respect to 214Bi and 208Tl

As presented in Section 1.3, the presence of impurities in the source foils may give rise to two-
electron events which mimic ββ decay and produce background events in the region of the ββ0ν
signal. These impurities have been suﬃciently reduced that given the energy resolution of the
calorimeter, the ultimate background for the ββ0ν signal is the tail of the ββ2ν decay distribution.
This is why acceptable levels of 214Bi and 208Tl in the foils depends on the number of ββ2ν events

in the region 2.8 to 3.2 MeV. For 10 kg of 100Mo (Qββ = 3.035 MeV), one background event/yr
is expected from the ββ2ν process above 2.8 MeV. As a consequence, the maximum levels of
214Bi and 208Tl contamination in the Mo source have been calculated to ensure that ββ2ν is
the limiting background, that means that 214Bi and 208Tl should yield less than 0.4 background
events/yr above 2.8 MeV for 10 kg of 100Mo. The associated limits are thus:

A(100Mo)(214Bi) < 0.3 mBq/kg

A(100Mo)(208Tl) < 0.02 mBq/kg

Characteristics of the source strips for each of the NEMO 3 sectors 10-19: η is the percentage of ββ
decay isotope in the enriched sample; M1, M2 and M3 are respectively the total mass of material in the
foils, the mass of the investigated element in the foils, and the mass of the ββ decay isotope in the foils.
In this table, (M) and (C) are written respectively for metallic and composite foil.

For 82Se the T 2ν
1/2 is 10 times longer than for 100Mo, however the available mass of this isotope is
only 1 kg. Similarly, simulations have given the maximum levels of contamination for 214Bi and
208Tl in a 1 kg Se source foil:

A(82Se)(214Bi) < 0.7 mBq/kg

A(82Se)(208Tl) < 0.05 mBq/kg

No speciﬁc limits for activities of these contaminants were required for the other isotopes. Given
the low mass of these isotopes, the limits obtained are not expected to be as competitive with
the Mo and Se sources.

The enrichment process involves the production of MoF6 gas from natural Mo. This gas is then
centrifuged to isolate the heavier Mo isotope such as 100Mo. The next step is an oxidation-
reduction reaction on the enriched 100MoF6 gas which yields 100MoO3 and ﬁnally 100Mo metallic
powder.

Radioactivity measurements of this enriched Mo powder have shown that the enrichment process
must be complemented with a puriﬁcation process, more speciﬁcally thorium extraction. However
8) mBq/kg for 214Bi and
the best measurements obtained with the HPGe spectrometer (
2) mBq/kg for 208Tl) did not satisfy the speciﬁc requirements for NEMO 3 given in
∼
Eq. 2 and Eq. 3. To reach these levels, the collaboration decided to investigate two diﬀerent
puriﬁcation methods in parallel: a physical process and a chemical process. The methods were
reﬁned using samples of natural molybdenum. HPGe measurements were made before and after
processing to identify improvements in the puriﬁcation processes.

2.1.4 Physical puriﬁcation of the enriched Mo powder and metallic strip fabrication

Enriched Mo powder is used directly to both purify and produce metallic foils. This puriﬁcation
process, developed by ITEP, involves transforming the powder into an ultrapure monocrystal
with a mass of around 1 kg.

The powder is ﬁrst pressed to obtain a solid Mo sample. Then the Mo is locally melted in a
vacuum with an electron beam and a monocrystal is drawn from the liquid portion. Impurities
coming from natural radioactivity decay chains make a migration towards the crystal extremities,
because these are more soluble in the melting zone than molybdenum. Finally, cutting the skin of
impurities oﬀ the crystal and repeating the process, one obtains a very pure sample, from which
an enriched puriﬁed Mo monocrystal can be grown, with a 20 mm diameter.

“Short” metallic strips, which are between 44 and 63 µm thick and between 64 and 1445 mm
long, are fabricated from the cut monocrystal by heating and rolling it in a vacuum to avoid
pollution. The next step is to trim the edges to obtain short strips 63 to 65 mm wide. Wastes
from each step can be recycled, either by the physical or chemical method.

After the radioactivity measurements (see Table 3 for the “best” limits), three to ﬁve short strips
are attached end-to-end to create a NEMO 3 strip with a length of around 2500 mm.

Metallic Mo strips were placed in sectors 02, 03 and 04. There are also ﬁve additional strips in
sector 01 and two strips in sector 05, which give a combined mass of (2479

5) g of 100Mo.

±

2.1.5 Chemical puriﬁcation of the enriched Mo powder and fabrication of composite strips

The chemical puriﬁcation process also starts with the metallic powder. The focus of this method
is to remove long lived radioactive isotopes of the 238U and 232Th decay chains while ﬁlling Ra
sites with Ba by spiking the sample during the processing. The process takes advantage of an
equilibrium break in the 238U and 232Th decay chains, which can selectively transform these
chains to non-equilibrium states in which only short lifetime daughters exist. The puriﬁcation
process was carried out in a class 100 clean room at INEEL. It is described in Ref. [12].

Table 3
Radioactivity measurements for the NEMO 3 source foils (in mBq/kg). The total enriched mass of each
isotope is given in bold characters. The error bars are statistical uncertainties at the 1σ level while the
limits are at the 2σ level. A systematic uncertainty of about 10% is associated with the Monte Carlo
calculations for the HPGe detector eﬃciencies. Only the lower limits obtained for 100Mo are presented,
for both metallic and composite strips. In the case of 48CaF2 the results are for the powder.

Radioactivity measurements of the puriﬁed enriched Mo powder samples were made with HPGe
spectroscopy in the LSM. The limits, A(214Bi) < 0.2 mBq/kg and A(208Tl) < 0.05 mBq/kg,
are the achievable levels for the HPGe detectors. The required limit on 214Bi (Eq. 2) is directly
measurable. The task of measuring the required limit for 208Tl (Eq. 3) is beyond the practical

measuring limits of the HPGe detectors in the LSM. However, the chemical extraction factors
deﬁned as the ratio of contamination before and after puriﬁcation were measured [12] for natural
and enriched Mo. This study implied by Ra extraction limits and indirectly inferred by measurable
quantities of 235U in the enriched Mo samples, showed that there is strong evidence that the 208Tl
contamination will be below the NEMO 3 design criteria. Ultimately, the NEMO 3 detector will
measure this activity.

The chemically puriﬁed 100Mo is used to make composite foils in the method previously discussed.
There are two types of backing ﬁlm used, Type 1 for sector 01 and Type 2 for sectors 05 and 10
through 16.

To produce the composite strips, the ﬁrst step involves sieving the powder to keep only grains
with diameters smaller than 45 µm. Then, the residual is ground up and several additional sieving
processes are undertaken so the grains are small enough to ensure a good bond to the backing
foil. Next the powder is mixed with the glue (water and PVA). The mixture is introduced into
a syringe, which is heated with ultra-sound to obtain a paste. This paste of desired thickness is
uniformly spread onto one of the two Mylar foils (backing ﬁlm). After 10 hours of drying, the
composite strip is cut to length with a surface density lower than 60 mg/cm2. The total mass of
100Mo in composite foils is (4435

22) g.

There is suﬃcient mass of 82Se to study the ββ0ν process. One can use a similar enrichment

in the gas to obtain the enriched Se powder.

0.05% for run 1 and 96.82

Two diﬀerent production runs of 500 g for 82Se powder were carried out. They had an enrichment
factor of 97.02
0.05% for run 2. No subsequent puriﬁcation process
was carried out. A portion of run 1 was already used in the NEMO 2 prototype and a value for the
214Bi contamination was measured, but the contaminants were found to be concentrated in small
”hot spots” and rejected in the analysis via identiﬁcation of the vertex of the candidate events [13].
The 82Se used in NEMO 2 foils was recovered and used to produce composite strips for NEMO 3.
The sample of material from run 2 plus the remaining part of run 1 were also used to produce
composite strips. Low activities in 214Bi (1.2
0.1 mBq/kg) were
measured for 0.8 kg of 82Se strips with the HPGe detector, as shown in Table 3. These correspond
to an expected background of 0.2 events/yr/kg from 214Bi and 1 event/yr/kg from 208Tl, but it
is expected that the measured contamination in these Se foils may again be localized and will be
suppressed through data analysis. In the mean time a puriﬁcation process is being developed at
INEEL for potential future runs with several kilograms of Se.

detected suggesting that the limit on 208Tl is close to a value which NEMO 3 should measure (see

ments (see Table 3) showed A(214Bi) < 3.0 mBq/kg (the maximum level of contamination re-
quired for NEMO 3 is 83 mBq/kg) but there was a small contamination of 208Tl ((10

powder.

The ﬁrst portion (24.6 g of enriched CaF2) of this powder was used for radioactivity measurements
with HPGe studies in the LSM. Only limits were obtained (see Table 3).

The second portion of this powder (17.5 g) was used to make nine 40 mm diameter disks. Mylar
was again used and cut in the shape of the disks. To create the calcium portion of strip 25%
of the 7th foil was populated with this material in sector 05. The disks were glued between two
Type 2 backing ﬁlms. In total there is 6.99

0.05 g of 48Ca.

natTe and copper sources

•
The foils of natTeO2 placed in the detector allows the NEMO collaboration to measure the external
background for 100Mo. The eﬀective Z of these foils (Z(natTeO2) = 43.2) is nearly the same as
that of the molybdenum foils (Z(Mo)= 42). This is useful because the external γ-ray background
can give rise to contamination processes, which are all proportional to Z 2. Thus, the background
for 100Mo and natTeO2 foils should give rise to similar event rates. In addition, natTeO2 has 33.8%
130Te and the ββ2ν process expected has Qββ = 2.53 MeV. Thus these events would not enter
the ββ0ν region of interest for 100Mo. Consequently, a background subtraction is possible for the
100Mo foils using an analysis of the natTeO2 spectrum.

It is also useful to study ββ processes for the 130Te part of natTeO2 (33.8%) compared to enriched
TeO2. Foils of natTeO2 were not puriﬁed, but radioactivity measurements showed limits lower
than 0.17 and 0.09 mBq/kg for 214Bi and 208Tl respectively, as shown in Table 3 (semi-conductor
purity levels).

The natTeO2 composite strips were made with Type 1 backing ﬁlms for 5 strips in sector 08 and
Type 3 for the 7 strips in sector 19. This gives a total mass of 614 g of natTeO2 or 166 g of 130Te.

The copper foil provides a similar study of external backgrounds for a smaller value of Z. The
metallic copper source is very pure (A(214Bi) < 0.12 mBq/kg and A(208Tl) < 0.04 mBq/kg) with
a mass of 621 g and was placed in sector 00.

2.2 Design of the calorimeter

2.2.1 Description

The three functions of the NEMO 3 calorimeter are to measure the particle energy, make time-
of-ﬂight measurements and give a fast trigger signal. The calorimeter is constructed with 1940
counters, each of which is made with a plastic scintillator, light guide and PMT (3” or 5”). The
gains of the PMTs have been adjusted to cover energies up to 12 MeV. The plastic scintillators
were chosen to minimize backscattering and for their radiopurity. The scintillators completely
cover the two cylindrical walls which surround the tracking volume. There is also partial coverage
of the top and bottom end-caps (also called petals).

The scintillator blocks are inside the helium-alcohol gas mixture of the tracking detector in order

to minimize energy loss in the detection of electrons. The blocks are supported by a rigid frame,
which allows the PMTs to be outside the helium environment. This conﬁguration prevents rapid
aging of the PMTs due to the helium.

The nomenclature for the calorimeter scintillator arrays is shown in Fig. 3. Note that the arrays
of scintillator for the calorimeter’s petals are identiﬁed as L1 through L4 as one goes out radially.
For the cylindrical walls of a sector the internal wall uses the designation IN for the array and for
the external wall there are EC and EE arrays to distinguish the blocks in the center (EC) versus
the edge (EE) of the wall. These seven types of scintillator are distinguished by their diﬀerent
shapes, which have been designed to ﬁt the circular geometry of the NEMO 3 detector, except for
the scintillator thickness (10 cm for all blocks). This thickness has been chosen in order to obtain
a high eﬃciency (50% at 500 keV) for γ-ray detection so as to measure the residual radioactivity
of the source foil and also to reject background events.

2.2.2 Scintillator and light guide characteristics

The INR Kiev-Kharkov collaboration (Ukraine) was given the charge of producing the 480 end-
cap scintillators and JINR was assigned the 1460 wall scintillators. The chemical nature of the
material using for scintillator production is the solid solution of a scintillating agent p-Terphenyl
(PTP) and a wavelength shifter 1.4-di-(5-phenyl-2-oxazoly)benzene (POPOP) in polystyrene.
After studies in both production laboratories, the mass fractions of polystyrene, PTP and POPOP
were chosen. These are respectively 98.75, 1.2 and 0.05% for the end-caps scintillators and 98.49,
1.5 and 0.01% for the blocks of the walls.

As performance objectives, the energy resolution σ(E)/E for 1 MeV electrons had to be better
than 6.2%. This resolution was checked during production using 482 and 976 keV conversion
electrons produced by a 207Bi source. After etching the blocks under water to obtain diﬀusive
reﬂection at the surfaces, there was an improvement in the resolution by about 1%. The average
values of the energy resolution were respectively 5.1% for IN blocks and 5.5% for EE and EC
blocks. To ensure the use of scintillators with the best resolution, a greater number of scintillator
blocks were produced than necessary: 1093 IN blocks for 680 used (62%), 994 EE blocks for 520
used (52%) and 428 EC blocks for 260 used (61%). In order to compare the performance of the
diﬀerent types of scintillator several tests were made such as optical transmission. For a 10 cm
thick samples from Dubna, the light transmission was on average 75% and always greater than
70% for the wavelength 420 nm (see Fig. 6). The radiopurity of the scintillator was measured
and found to be respectively 430 and 60 times lower in 214Bi and 208Tl activity than the PMTs
used to read it out, which are also low radioactivity PMTs (see Table 4). The scintillator blocks
were then sent to CENBG and IReS to mount the blocks with the best resolution on the walls
and petals of the detector.

For the light guides optical PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) was manufactured for the experi-
ment and used for the scintillator and PMT interface. This also protects the PMTs from helium.
The light transmission through the guides is 98% in the wavelength range 380-420 nm. To ensure
rigidity the light guide is glued to an iron ring, which provides a pressﬁt between the guide and
the petal or wall.

2.2.3 Photomultiplier tube characteristics

Development of low background PMTs was begun in 1992, in a collaboration between diﬀerent
manufacturers and physicists studying dark matter, double beta decay and neutrino oscillations.
The selection criterion for the low radioactivity glass was for the contamination in 40K, 214Bi
and 208Tl to be lower than 1.7, 0.83 and 0.17 Bq/kg respectively. The Hamamatsu company was
chosen to produce the PMTs for NEMO 3, with the radiopurity of their glass being 100 to 1000
times better than standard glass (see Table 4). The other parts of their PMTs also have very low
contamination (see Section 2.8 for the radioactivity measurements of the PMTs).

The IN, L1, L2 and L3 scintillator blocks were coupled to R6091 3” PMTs (230 g, 1040 pieces).
These tubes have 12 dynodes and a ﬂat photocathode. The EE, EC and L4 scintillator blocks
were coupled to R6594 5” PMTs (385 g, 900 pieces). These 5” tubes have 10 dynodes and a
hemispherical photocathode for structural integrity and thus need a second interface guide to
match the design between the PMT and the light guide.

The Hamamatsu PMTs were chosen not only for their low background but also for their perfor-
mance. A dedicated test station using a H2 lamp was developed. The energy and time resolutions
were measured at 1 MeV, the average values were respectively 4% and 250 ps. The linearity of
the response of the PMTs was studied as a function of the energies between 0 and 12 MeV. Also,
the symmetry and the uniformity of the photocathode was investigated and ﬁnally the noise at
the minimal threshold, 10 mV (

33 keV).

∼

2.2.4 Preparation and installation of the scintillator blocks

A visual check on the color of the block was made. Then ﬁve layers of 70 µm thick Teﬂon
ribbon were wrapped around the four lateral faces of the scintillator block to diﬀusely scatter
the scintillation light for improved light collection.

The energy resolution and the peak position at 1 MeV were checked for several locations on
the entrance face of the block with an electron spectrometer using a 90Sr source. The spectrom-
eter had an intrinsic energy resolution of 0.6%. This test identiﬁed and rejected blocks with
inhomogeneities.

All six faces of the blocks, with the exception of the contact region for the light guide, were
covered with sheets of aluminized Mylar. The Mylar not only protects the scintillators from
ambient light and from light produced by Geiger propagation plasma in the tracking region,
but also enhances the light reﬂection inside the scintillator, while minimizing energy lost by the
electrons at the entrance face.

After gluing 2 the scintillator block to the petals and the walls, the peak position and energy
resolution at 1 MeV were measured at the center of each block, using the electron spectrometer.
This information was used to identify particular scintillator block and PMT combinations so as
to obtain an energy resolution for the calorimeter which was as uniform as possible. The details
of the performance of the calorimeter are given in Section 3.4.

2.2.5 Assembly of the PMTs in the LSM

Once a sector was transported to the LSM, the 3” PMTs were glued directly to the light guides,
while the 5” PMTs ﬁrst had the interface guide glued to the light guide and then the inter-
face/light guide combination glued to the 5” PMTs. After a check to see that the system was
light-tight, a µ-metal shield was placed around each PMT.

2.3 The tracking detector

The tracking volume of the NEMO 3 detector is made of layers of vertical drift cells working in
Geiger mode. After a long period of research and development at LAL, which had the responsi-
bility for the tracking portion of the detector, the optimal parameters were identiﬁed for the best
resolution and eﬃciency while minimizing multiple scattering eﬀects. This optimization involved

2 A systematic check of the radiopurity for all the glues used in the NEMO 3 detector was carried out
in the LSM [16]

a balance between two parameters which contribute to aging eﬀects of the wires. The ﬁrst is the
diameter of the cell’s wires which needs to be as low as possible for better transparency in the
tracking device. The second is the proportion of helium and alcohol in the gas mixture.

2.3.1 Elementary Geiger cell

The cross section of each cell is “octagonal” in design with a diameter of 3 cm that is outlined by
8 wires. The basic cell consists of a central anode wire surrounded by the 8 ground wires, which
belong to four adjacent cells to minimize the number of wires. However, between layers an extra
ground wire was added to each cell to avoid electrostatic cross talk. All the wires are stainless
steel, 50 µm in diameter and 2.7 m long. The wires are strung between the two iron petals of
each sector which form the top and bottom of the detector (see Fig. 3). On each end of the cell,
there is a cylindrical cathode probe, which will be referred to as the cathode ring. The cathode
ring is 3 cm in length and 2.3 cm in diameter. The anode wire runs through the center of this
ring while the ground wires are supported just outside the ring. If one compares NEMO 3 to the
previous prototypes NEMO 1 and NEMO 2, there is a new mechanism for securing the wires
in the petals. The advantages of this new mechanism are that it allows easy wire installation,
avoids the radioactivity of solder, and provides simple serviceability if replacement is necessary.

The cells work in the Geiger mode with initially a mixture of helium gas with ethyl alcohol. The
characteristic operating voltage for the anode wires is 1800 V. When a charged particle crosses a
cell the ionized gas yields around six electrons per centimeter. These electrons drift towards the
anode wire at a speed of about 2.3 cm/µs when the electrons are close to the anode. When they
are far away from the anode wire the mean drift velocity is around 1 cm/µs, because the layout
of the wires (ﬁeld and ground) establishes a varying electric ﬁeld within each cell.

Measurements of these drift times are used to reconstruct the transverse position of the particle
in the cells. The Geiger regime has a fast rise time for the anode pulse (around 10 ns) which
can be used with a ﬁxed threshold to provide a good time reference for the TDC measurements
(see Section 2.4). In the Geiger regime, the avalanche near the anode wire develops into a Geiger
plasma which propagates along the wire at a speed of 6 to 7 cm/µs, depending on the working
point (Geiger plateau) which is a function of the gas mixture and operating voltage. The arrival
of the plasma at the ends of the wire is detected with the cathode rings mentioned above. The
propagation times are used to determine the longitudinal position of the particle as it passes
through the cell.

2.3.2 NEMO 3 tracking device

Tracking simulations in a 25 Gauss magnetic ﬁeld were investigated. The study revealed the
optimum conﬁguration for the layers of cells in the sectors of NEMO 3. Taking into account
multiple scattering in the track reconstruction the result was four layers near the source foil
followed by a gap, then two layers and another gap followed by three layers near the scintillator
wall (the “4-2-3” layer conﬁguration, see Fig. 3). Thus, there are nine layers on each side of the
source foil to reconstruct tracks. The gaps between the groups of cell layers is due to the position
of the plastic scintillators on the petals. The four layers near the source foil are suﬃcient to
provide a precise vertex position. Two layers in the middle and three layers close to the plastic
scintillator walls provide good trajectory curvature measurements.

2.3.3 Assembly and wiring of a sector

To suspend the wire cells the iron petals have an intricate pattern of holes drilled into them in
order to support the 4-2-3 layer conﬁguration. The sectors were wired in a class 10,000 clean
room. Studies with prototypes conﬁrmed the need for very high quality wire for proper plasma
propagation. To fulﬁll this requirement a special production run of a 200 km long stainless steel
wire, that was 50 µm in diameter, was contracted 3 . Precision in the diameter is better than 1%.
Wires were strung layer by layer, alternating ground and anode wires. The wiring of one sector
took about four weeks for the 1991 wires.

Cells are of high quality if two conditions are satisﬁed simultaneously: at operating voltage the
counting rate is free of secondary triggers and electrical discharges while having the Geiger plasma
propagated to both extremities of the cell. A special container measuring 6.4 m3 was used to test
each of the 20 sectors. The measured counting rates in the cells using cosmic rays is around 60 Hz
compared to 0.2 Hz in the LSM before the coil and shields were added. Thus a test for one week
at LAL corresponds to several years of operation in the LSM. As a result of the anode tests, it
was found that on average 10 of the 340 anode wires were replaced per sector. Fewer than 10
ground wires per sector needed to be replaced. This exercise also demonstrated the eﬃciency of
cell repair.

The ﬁnal step, to ensure a tight seal to contain the helium, used silicon RTV to outline the
regions to be sealed, and then Araldite. A gas seal was also formed between the petals and walls,
at the exterior of the sectors.

2.4 Electronics, trigger and data acquisition systems

The NEMO 3 detector has calorimeter and tracking detector independent electronics and data
acquisition systems with a trigger system that can be inter-dependent. The electronics, trigger
and data acquisition are separated into modules which share a VME bus. This design permits
not only ββ runs, but also diﬀerent tests to adjust and calibrate the detector.

2.4.1 Calorimeter electronics

The PMT bases are designed with a progressive voltage divider to improve the linearity under
conditions of high current. Tests carried out at the IReS laboratory identiﬁed ﬁxed sets of resistors
for the PMT bases which control the voltage between the photocathode and the ﬁrst dynode so
as to optimize the time resolution.

Three large power supplies from C.A.E.N. 4 are used to supply the HV for the 1940 PMTs. Each
HV channel is shared by three PMTs via a distribution board. The three PMTs must be similar
in gain and ﬁne tuning is done with two carefully selected ﬁxed resistors on the distribution
board for each PMT. Data taken with a 207Bi source was used to set the PMTs’ gains. There are

3 Trakus factory, Germany
4 C.A.E.N. HV power supply type SY527 10 boards A938 AP, 24 channels each, with AMP multicontact
connectors

nine distribution boards per sector and each board has four HV channels that in turn supply 12
PMTs.

The 97 PMTs of each sector are divided by the source foil into the interior and exterior regions.
A total of 46 PMTs are used for the interior region of which 12 PMTs are on the top and bottom
petals. The exterior region is covered with 51 PMTs, again with 12 PMTs on the top and bottom
petals. Thus, there is a total of 40 half-sectors for which front-end electronics boards are designed.
The corresponding 40 mother boards are housed in three VMEbus crates and each mother board
supports 46 or 51 analog-NEMO (ANEMO) daughter boards.

The ANEMO boards have both a low and a high threshold discriminator. If the PMT signal
exceeds the lower level threshold it starts a TDC measurement and opens a charge integration
gate for 80 ns. The high threshold discriminator is adjustable up to 1 V but generally runs at
48 mV corresponding to 150 keV. The high threshold discriminator works as a one shot that
delivers an event signal to the mother board.

Each mother board in turn provides an analog signal to the trigger logic which reﬂects the number
of channels that have exceeded the upper threshold. The signal strength is 1 mA per channel.
This level is used to trigger the system (1st level trigger) if the desired multiplicity of active
PMTs is achieved. The trigger logic then produces a signal called STOP-PMT, which is sent
to all the calorimeter electronic channels, to save their data. So the TDCs are stopped and the
integrated charge is stored. Then digital conversions begin. At the same time, a signal is sent
to the calorimeter acquisition processor, which permits the read out of the digitized times and
charges for the active channels.

The analog-to-digital conversions of the charge and the timing signal are made with two 12-bit
ADCs. The energy resolution is 0.36 pC/channel (
3 keV/channel) and the time resolution is
53 ps/channel. If any PMT signal exceeds the high level threshold then the TDC measurement
and charge integration are aborted and the system resets after 200 ns.

2.4.2 Tracking detector electronics

The Geiger electronics are divided into two types of boards. The ﬁrst is for secondary voltage
distribution, which provides 1800 V to the anode wires. Included on the secondary distribution
boards are the analog signals from the anode wire and the two cathode rings. These boards
receive high voltage from two of the C.A.E.N. power supplies 5 . The second type of board is for
the tracking electronics and is an acquisition board which is connected to the distribution board.
It uses ASICs 6 and has an interface with a 50 MHz clock (20 ns per channel).

The functions of the acquisition board are ﬁrst ampliﬁcation and then discrimination of analog
signals coming from the distribution board. Time measurements for each cell are acquired for
the anode wire and the two cathode rings. Note that the two cathode times are identiﬁed as tLC
and tHC where LC and HC stand for low and high cathode times. The low one corresponds to
the cathode ring on the bottom of the detector and the high for the top.

Each of the 20 sectors needs the following electronics. Eight secondary distribution boards receive

5 C.A.E.N. HV power supply type SY527 with A734P boards, 16 channels each
6 Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuit

a total of 15 daughter boards, of which ﬁve for the anode, ﬁve for LC and ﬁve for HC signals.
The ﬁve sets of three diﬀerent daughter boards services eight cells per set, so that there are 40
cells per distribution board. Then each sector also needs eight acquisition boards, which receive
10 analog ASIC and 10 digital ASIC circuits, with each ASIC handling four cells, so 40 cells per
board.

Each of the four channels of the analog ASIC 7 is used to amplify the anode and two cathode
signals by a factor of 60, and to compare them to anode and cathode thresholds generated by a
software programable 8-bit DAC. For signals exceeding the thresholds, a comparator provides a
TTL signal which is sent to the TDC scalers of the digital ASIC. There are four TDCs for each
of the four channels of the digital ASIC 8 . The ﬁrst three are for the anode (tdcA), low cathode
(tdcLC) and high cathode (tdcHC) contents which are measured with a 12-bit TDC and give
times between 0 and 82 µs. The alpha TDC (tdcα) is 17-bits, which provides time measurements
between 0 and 2.6 ms.

The anode signal starts the TDCs and creates an OR signal (called HIT) for all the cells of a
layer of a given sector; so 360 TTL signals are sent to the T2 trigger (see Section 2.4.3).

The propagation of the Geiger plasma is detected by the cathode rings. These signals stop
their respective cathode TDCs and give tdcLC and tdcHC values. Physical propagation times are
proportional to these values:

20] ns

tLC = [tdcLC ×
20)

tHC = [(tdcHC ×

−

17.5] ns

The time constant, 17.5 ns, is removed from tHC to take into account the diﬀerence in cable
lengths: the low cathode cables are 6 m and high cathode cables 9.5 m.

Concerning the anode signal, there are two cases which have to be distinguished. The anode signal
can exceed its threshold before or after the arrival of the STOP-A signal which comes from the
trigger (see Section 2.4.3). In the ﬁrst case, for β-type events, the STOP-A signal is used to stop
the tdcA channels which have received an earlier start signal. Anode times tA, correspond to the
transverse drift time given by:

tA = [(tdcmax −

tdcA)

20] ns

×

where tdcmax corresponds to 6.14 µs.

In the second case, for α-type events, all Geiger cells not already triggered can register delayed
hits which occur after the STOP-A has been received for up to 704 µs. Anode signals exceeding
their threshold start not only their anode and cathode TDCs but also their alpha TDCs (tdcα).

Cathode signals stop the cathode TDCs and give tdcLC and tdcHC values, but the anode and
alpha TDCs are stopped by the STOP-α signal coming from the trigger. As a consequence, in

(8)

this case the tdcA and tdcα have the same value modulo 4096 for these cells. The corresponding
alpha time tα is then given by:

tα = [(tdcα max −

tdcα)

20] ns

×

(9)

where tdcα max corresponds to

704 µs.

2.4.3 The NEMO 3 trigger system

The trigger system was developed by LPC. It receives one analog signal from each of the 40 half-
sectors that is proportional to the number of PMTs that have exceeded their high threshold in
that sector. The 40 signals are summed resulting in an analog signal. The trigger then goes onto
the second level which involves the Geiger layers. In this case 360 channels are read out by treating
each Geiger layer in each sector as a bit, which is on if the layer is hit. This information allows the
use of a rough track recognition program to be run on the available Geiger cell information. It is
then possible to reﬁne the identiﬁed tracks by spatially connecting the Geiger cells and triggered
PMTs.

Timing constraints and trigger strategy lead to a two level trigger system (see Fig. 7) for normal
running with a third trigger for calibration runs.

VME order

The ﬁrst level (T1) of the trigger, is embedded on the T1-3 board, and is based on the number
of PMTs required to initiate a readout. It is used to identify the number of active scintillators
by using the summed current from the 40 analog signals to deﬁne the multiplicity of the event
(MULT).

If the trigger logic encounters a multiplicity higher than that set by the MULT threshold up to
20 ns after the ﬁrst triggered PMT, T1 generates the STOP-PMT signal, which is the timing
reference of the experiment, with an electronic accuracy better than 150 ps.

The second level (T2) consists of track recognition in the Geiger layers (GG), using the 40
half-sectors. The track recognition is ﬁrst performed on a per half-sector basis. Nevertheless, the
probability for an electron to cross more than one sector is high, so tracks that cross two adjacent
half-sectors are searched for in a second step. Thus, there are two secondary levels.

The ﬁrst level search is between four diﬀerent possible tracking patterns, which correspond re-
spectively to a long track, a short track near the foil, a short track near the scintillator block or no
track; the second level consists of making special associations between adjacent half-sectors. For
example a long track in a half-sector and any kind of track or no track in the adjacent half-sector.
One possibility is to use two short tracks in two adjacent half-sectors, one near the foil and the
other near the calorimeter walls, which allows the trigger to select a full track contained in more
than one sector.

This level is embedded on the T2I (internal) and T2E (external) boards, which receive 180 HIT
signals each and provide nine logical signals from a logical OR which lasts for 1.5 µs on the
cells of each layer. If the trigger logic is satisﬁed for the chosen track condition, a second level
local trigger is generated. The T2 level conditions on the T2I/E boards are set in programmable
memories.

The third level (T3), which is only used for calibration runs, is embedded on the T1-3 board
and checks on the possible coincidence between pre-tracks from T2’s second stage and ﬁred
PMT half-sectors. This level selects electron tracks coming from radioactive sources installed
in the calibration tubes. It is implemented in hardware without the possibility of changing the
algorithm.

For the case of an active PMT and Geiger cell trigger condition (PMT+GG), if the second level
trigger is detected, the STOP-A signal is sent to Geiger acquisition boards with the programmable
delay. This delay is set to 6.14 µs after the STOP-PMT signal. Then two trigger signals are sent
to the Geiger and calorimeter electronics with a programmable delay set to 6.14 µs after the
STOP-PMT signal. The ﬁrst signal stops the automatic time-out which occurs 102 µs after the
STOP-A signal. The second permits the digitization of the analog signals of the activated PMTs.
In case these signals are not received there is an automatic reset of each of the PMT channels
which have started measurements. Finally, the STOP-α is sent to the Geiger acquisition boards
with a ﬁxed delay of 710 µs after the STOP-PMT signal.

2.4.4 The NEMO 3 data acquisition system

The control and readout of the calorimeter and Geiger cell crates is performed with the inter-crate
VICbus and two CES RIO 8062 computer modules equipped with PowerPC 604E-300MHz CPU
chips. The data acquisition system is based on Cascade [17] operating under the Lynx-OS software
package developed at CERN. It uses two boards: Corbo PMT for the calorimeter readout trigger
and Corbo GG for the track detector readout trigger. The two independent acquisition processors
collect information in parallel. After the processors have read out the event and de-activated their
“busy” signal, the trigger system reinitializes its logic electronics for the next event. Data buﬀers

for the calorimeter and Geiger cells are then sent to the event builder processor (EVB) via the
PVIC bus (multidrop PCI-to-PCI high speed link), as described in Section 3.2.

2.4.5 Survey of the experiment

Monitoring and control of the experiment from remote sites is possible with two dedicated PCs
in the LSM. The two PCs also operate locally. The tasks of these two PCs are not overlapping.
The ﬁrst controls the gas system of the tracking chamber, the current in the magnetic coil and
the high voltage on the Geiger and PMT boards. The second controls the on/oﬀ power for the
acquisition boards and crates, the high voltage crates and the uninterruptible power supply.

2.4.6 The NEMO 3 database: NEMO DB

The MySQL database management system is used for NEMO 3. Data synchronization in the
NEMO DB server network is based on the replication concept of the MySQL package. Here any
number of servers can be replicate and transfer data from one primary server. The structure of
the NEMO MySQL servers includes the primary server at the LSM for information stored in the
on-line database, the main server at Lyon CCIN2P3 9 which contains all the data, and a set of
local servers mirroring the main server.

The NEMO DB contains the electronic logbook of the runs, the calibration parameters of scin-
tillator counters and Geiger cells, as well as other information about the run conditions.

2.5 Energy and time calibration of the counters

2.5.1 Introduction

In order to measure accuratly the absolute energy released in a double beta decay (Qββ), a
calibration procedure was established. The solution for NEMO 3 is to use radioactive sources
that can be introduced into the detector and present only during runs dedicated to calibration.
These absolute energy measurements run for extended periods and take place only two or three
times a year. Thus, daily studies of the stability of the counters are done with a laser survey
system.

Timing information is used to discriminate between external and internal events for background
studies (see Section 1.3). The relative timing oﬀsets for each of the 1940 counters has to be
determined, using particles emitted in coincidence from 60Co radioactive sources. Particle times-
of-ﬂight are also corrected for several eﬀects speciﬁcally the amplitude corrections due to leading
edge discriminators (called time-energy corrections) and TDC slope corrections. These corrections
are also checked with the laser survey system.

2.5.2 Mechanics of the calibration tubes

Each of the 20 sectors of the detector is equipped with a vertical tube made of ﬂattened copper
that is located along the edge of the source foils (see Fig. 3) and three pairs of kapton windows:
one window of the pair is oriented towards the internal wall and the other towards the external
90, 0 and +90 cm
one. The size of the windows (
with an accuracy better than 1 mm) have been chosen to obtain an approximately uniform
illumination of the scintillator blocks by three radioactive sources placed inside the tube. The
source carrier is a long narrow delrin rod supporting three source holders which are introduced
into the copper tube from the top of the detector, after the removal of some shields on the top.

2.5.3 Radioactive sources

For energy calibration of the counters, one needs radioactive sources which emit electrons. The
choice was made to use 207Bi and 90Sr sources. Decay of the ﬁrst one provides conversion elec-
trons of 482 and 976 keV energy (K lines) suited for an energy calibration up to 1.5 MeV. The
products in 207Bi decay are essentially γ-rays, thus the tracking chamber must be in operation to
select electrons originating directly from the sources. To measure energies up to 3 MeV or more,
one needs at least one additional calibration point, which is obtained using electrons from 90Y
(daughter of 90Sr) and measuring the end-point of the β spectrum at 2.283 MeV. This calibration
does not require pattern recognition because the events of interest are located in the tail of the
spectrum, which can only contain electrons coming directly from the sources. Relatively intense
sources are used here for short runs.

For timing calibration, the relative oﬀsets for each channel are determined with a 60Co source,
which emits two coincident γ-rays with energies of 1332 and 1173 keV. Spectra of arrival time
diﬀerences are collected to establish time delays between the 1940 channels. This time calibration
does not require the use of the tracking chamber and allows the use of relatively intense sources.

2.5.4 Laser calibration system

In an experiment such as NEMO 3, which requires stability for many years over a large number
of PMTs, frequent tests of the detector’s stability are of paramount importance. The objectives
of the chosen laser calibration system 10 , as shown in Fig. 8, are ﬁrst a daily check of the absolute
energy and time calibration, which permits the calculation of the corrections according to the
emission peak. Next measurements of the PMTs linearity between 0 and 12 MeV are made and
ﬁnally is determined the time-energy relation. To accomplish this, the shape of the laser signal
has to be very similar to the one produced by an electron. Thus the laser light must be known
with very high accuracy (< 1%) and must be stable during the measurement. One needs also a
precise calibration of the optical ﬁlter transmission for the energy range 0 to 12 MeV and a good
common time reference (STOP).

The N2 laser wavelength of 337
15 nm was selected. Then the light beam is split into two parts.
The ﬁrst is sent to a photodiode, which monitors the laser light intensity. A variable optical
attenuator is used to adjust the ﬂux. The second beam goes through two optical ﬁlter wheels to

±

10 MNL 202 laser from Lasertechnik Berlin; 200 kW, 10 Hz

simulate the full range of energy. This beam is then wavelength shifted to 420 nm and sent to
the NEMO 3 PMTs by means of optical ﬁbers. The shifter is a sphere of scintillator, wrapped in
Teﬂon and aluminum to increase diﬀusive reﬂections, used to mimic the signal of electrons in the
scintillators. Each optical ﬁber 11 is divided into two strands and the optical distance between
these two is adjustable using individual attenuators, which allow the distribution of the same
ﬂux of light to all the counters. Six reference counters (independent of the NEMO 3 calorimeter)
equipped with 207Bi sources allow the monitoring of the laser by measuring energies of both the
laser and the 976 keV conversion electrons emitted from 207Bi.

Fig. 8. The laser calibration system.

The daily laser procedure is carried out in two steps. The ﬁrst one is during the run under
standard conditions for the acquisition of ββ events (ββ run). It consists in stabilizing the laser
and checking parameters, such as photodiode pedestal and laser light. During this step the ﬂux
can be corrected if necessary. The second step is made at the end of the ββ run. It consists of a
pedestal measurement for the PMTs 12 , then a rotation of two ﬁlter wheels to obtain a 1 MeV
equivalent ﬂux, this is followed by the acquisition of the laser and 207Bi events. Finally the laser
is turned oﬀ and the ﬁlter wheels moved to opaque settings. For “complete” calibration run up
to 12 MeV, the procedure is only repeated few times during the year with diﬀerent ﬂuxes and
changing the rotation of the two optical attenuator disks for each run.

2.5.5 Absolute energy calibration method

Over the full 12 MeV range of energies measured by NEMO 3, the relation between the charge
signal and energy deposited in the counter is not necessarily linear. The relation is, however,
linear up to 4 MeV, where the greatest accuracy is required:

E = a (C

P ) + b

−

(10)

here C is the ADC value of the scintillator and P is the pedestal. The energy calibration constants
a and b are determined using at least two points from measurements with radioactive sources,

11 Toray PFU-CD501-10-E
12 1940 PMTs from the NEMO 3 calorimeter and six PMTs for the reference counters

while the relation for the energies greater than 4 MeV is determined using a “complete” laser
calibration run.

The energy resolution is assumed to have essentially two contributions. The principal component
originates from the statistical ﬂuctuations of the scintillation photons and from the number of
photo-electrons at the PMT anode. It increases as the square root of the energy. The second
component is due to the instrumental eﬀects which are energy independent. These two terms
contribute to the resolution in quadrature in the form:

σ(E) = A√E

Using 60 207Bi sources (
150 keV), a 24
hour run yields about 5000 events for each PMT with identiﬁable tracks. Then the positions of

and 90Sr are combined to extract the parameters a and b of a linear calibration valid for the
energy region up to 4 MeV. The results of energy calibration runs are presented in Section 3.4.

2.5.6 Energy corrections using the laser system

The laser procedure is carried out as a reference just after the calibration runs and gives a ﬁducial
reference energy, E0, for each counter (one assumes there is no correction to be applied to the b
oﬀset). At a later time t a new value of the energy, Et, is measured:

E0 = a0(C0 −

Et = at(Ct −
where ecorr is the correction factor to be applied. It represents the variation of the calibration slope
of the counter as a function of time between t0 and t. This variation of the laser is determined by
comparing the laser peak position (Claser) and the 976 keV peak position from the 207Bi (CBi)
between t0 and t for the six reference counters. Results are then transferred to the database.

2.5.7 Time calibration

The timing response of two counters detecting two particles emitted in coincidence depends not
only on the time-of-ﬂight of each particle, but also on several eﬀects which have to be corrected

for.

•

Time alignment of the counters

All PMTs must be aligned in time. The time taken for each PMT to respond to a signal depends
on the individual characteristics of the counter. In order to use only one time scale, an alignment
procedure has been developed to obtain the individual time shifts ε(i) (i = 1 to 1940). The
procedure to ﬁnd ε(i) uses γ-rays emitted in coincidence by a decay in a 60Co radioactive source
and detected by a pair of scintillators. There is a common START in the electronics for both
counters and the electronics uses a common STOP-PMT for all the counters, which allows the
individual delays to be extracted.

In order to calculate the time-of-ﬂight correctly, only one 60Co source of 15.5 kBq is used per run.
Ten runs with diﬀerent source positions are performed in order to cover all possible combinations

The eﬀect of leading edge discriminators is to induce a time-vs-energy dependence, which can be
described with a formula using four parameters

and taking into account the pulse shape. Determination of the parameters p(i)
(k = 1 to 4 for

0 and 12 MeV. The relative timing oﬀset ε(i) for counter i is then included in the asymptotic
value p(i)

The laser survey system is also used to obtain daily time response corrections for each counter,

2.6 Coil and shields

2.6.1 Introduction

To reach the desired sensitivity for the eﬀective neutrino mass, there must be no events (<
0.1) from external backgrounds in the energy range [2.8 - 3.2] MeV during ﬁve years of data
collection. The external background contribution coming from neutrons is due to (α, n) reactions,
spontaneous ﬁssion of uranium and the interaction of cosmic ray muons in the rocks. The other
external background contribution is the γ-ray ﬂux produced in the LSM, which has been studied

using a NaI detector surrounded by diﬀerent shields [18]. The origins of these γ-rays are natural
radioactivity, radiative neutron captures and the bremsstrahlung of muons.

As shown in Section 2.8, the detector has been designed with stringent radiopurity for its con-
struction materials. For the external background coming from γ-rays and neutrons, several studies
were made with the NEMO 2 detector as well as the NEMO 3 simulations [19]. These have shown
that there is a large reduction in these backgrounds given the following conditions to the experi-
ment. A solenoid capable of producing a ﬁeld of 25 G is surrounded by two external shields, the
ﬁrst one to reduce γ-ray and thermal neutron ﬂuxes, the second to suppress the contribution of
slow and fast neutrons. The design of the coil and shields allows for partial dismantling of the
detector to access each sector.

2.6.2 The magnetic coil

The simulation of the fast neutrons coming from the laboratory into NEMO 3 was carried out
with 20 cm of iron shield. The contribution to the ββ0ν background by the γ-rays created from
neutron captures leads mainly to (e+e−) events and also to a few (e−e−) events produced in the
source foils. The detection by the calorimeter of the γ-rays associated with these events provides
a high rejection eﬃciency (80%). A 25 G magnetic ﬁeld, which provides the charge recognition
rejects 95% of the (e+e−) pair events.

The coil surrounds the entire detector and access to the detector was a necessary design consider-
ation. Thus, the coil is made of ten sections with 203 copper rings connecting every other sector
to form one loop of the helix (see Fig. 1). The ﬁnished coil is cylindrical, 5320 mm in diameter,
2713 mm in height and has a mass of 5 tons (

3.1 tons of high radiopurity copper).

∼

2.6.3 Iron shield

The iron shield is also made in ten sections (165 tons) with two end-caps (6 tons each). The
lower end-cap is ﬁxed and the upper one is removable. The iron shield is 20 cm thick, except for
a few places where it is 18 cm on account of mechanical supports. The iron was selected for its
radiopurity, as recorded in Table 6.

2.6.4 Neutron shield

The remaining (e+e−) pair events (5% not rejected by curvature measurements) and the (e−e−)
events due to the γ-rays created by neutron capture can be suppressed only if the ﬂux of neutrons
inside the detector is decreased. NEMO 3’s neutron shield is optimized to stop fast neutrons with
an energy of a few MeV, it also suppresses thermal and epithermal neutrons.

The neutron shield is made of three parts, as shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst one is situated below the
central tower of the detector (not shown in the ﬁgure) and consists of paraﬃn 20 cm thick. The
second part covers the end-caps below and above the detector, and consists of 28 cm of wood.
The cylindrical external walls are covered with ten large tanks containing borated water which
are 35 cm thick and separated by wood 28 cm thick.

2.7 Mounting and assembly of the detector in the LSM

2.7.1 Supporting structure

The steel framework, which supports the NEMO 3 sectors, is made of two parts. It was installed
in the LSM at the end of 1998 and supports the 20 sectors of the detector, the magnetic coil
and the various shields. All the components of the framework were selected for their radiopurity.
To properly enclose the active detector and have access to readout electronics in the narrow
experimental hall, the detector was raised oﬀ the ground two meters. Thus the control and
readout electronics can be housed under the detector. This structure preserves proximity and
serviceability of the electronics and detector.

2.7.2 Placing of the sectors on the supporting structure

Once the sectors were made helium tight, the anode and cathode cables were connected at LAL
before being transported to the LSM, where PMTs were attached. After gluing and testing the
PMTs, the sectors were carried inside the source mounting room and cleaned using alcohol and
nitrogen gas.

The source frame, which supports the seven foils of each sector, was prepared simultaneously in
the LSM clean room. This source frame was then mounted in the sector. Finally, the calibration
tube was set in position and the sector was cleaned once again with nitrogen and closed with
sheets of Mylar.

The source mounting room was then opened to move the sectors to the supporting structure.
The calorimeter cables (HV and signal) were soldered to the PMT bases and to the distribution
daughter boards. These operations were followed by the introduction of the plastic optical ﬁbers
into brass tubes which are present in each light guide of the calorimeter. Finally there was a
through test of the connections for the calorimeter, the tracking detector and the laser system
(both electrical and optical). During these procedures the sectors were ﬁlled with nitrogen to
avoid deposition of impurities on the wires.

These tasks were previously checked in the year 2000 for three sectors (00, 18 and 19). The 17
remaining sectors of NEMO 3 were gradually installed and tested until August 2001. The 20
sectors were then placed in their ﬁnal positions and the helium seals made using RTV glue.

The total ﬁducial volume inside the tracking detector is 28 m3 (excluding the scintillator volume).
The detector was ﬁlled with gas in December 2001, using a fast ﬂushing of helium gas (5 volumes),
followed by introduction of ethyl alcohol in the gas regulation system. The whole process took
approximately 24 h. A constant pressure of gas was maintained with a ﬂux of the order of 130 l/h
until December 2002. The magnetic coil was installed in February 2002 and γ-shield in April 2002.
Finally, the installation of the neutron shield was completed in February 2003. Between each step,
ββ and calibration runs were taken to monitor stability and the eﬀectiveness of the shields for
comparisons with simulations.

Data collection was temporarily stopped in December 2002 to make several improvements. These
involved changes in HV power supplies for the calorimeter PMTs’ overvoltage protection, while
noise and gain adjustments were made on several PMTs. Helium leaks were sealed and there was

an addition of argon into the gas mixture of the tracking detector in order to improve the Geiger
cell stability and eﬃciency of the plasma’s longitudinal propagation as well as limiting the aging
problems. At the same time, the proportion of quencher in the mixture was reduced from 40
to 39 mbars partial pressure (ethyl alcohol at 14oC instead of 15oC). The gas mixture used in
the day-to-day running is now He with Ar (with V (Ar)/V (He) = 1%) and ethyl alcohol as the
quencher at a ﬂux of 300 l/h. An overpressure of
10 mbars is maintained to ﬂush contaminants
from the surrounding gas volume.

∼

In mid-February 2003, new ββ runs commenced under improved conditions, with the coil and
both shields.

2.8 Radiopurity of the detector

γ-ray spectra were acquired using low background HPGe detectors located at CENBG and in
the LSM. These HPGe spectrometers typically use the “Marinelli” geometry to measure the
abundance of selected isotopes in the decay chains via the strength of selected gamma lines.

Radioactivity measurements of the source foils

•
A 400 cm3 HPGe spectrometer in the LSM has a sensitivity capable of reaching 0.2 mBq/kg of
214Bi and 0.06 mBq/kg of 208Tl in a month with a 1 kg sample. The maximum allowed levels of
214Bi and 208Tl contamination in the Mo sources are given in Eq. 2 and 3. The level of sensitivity
necessary for 214Bi was achieved, but not for 208Tl. A solution could be reached by counting for
more than one month but the collaboration has decided to make a compromise between the source
measurement and the detector’s construction. Radioactivity measurements for all the NEMO 3
sources are summarized in Table 3. Only the lower limits obtained for 100Mo are presented, for
both the metallic and composite strips. In this table it can be seen that for 208Tl only limits have
been obtained except in 82Se and 150Nd2O3 strips. In the case of 82Se, the presence of “hot-spots”,
which can be suppressed by analysis, is anticipated. For 150Nd, it is not a problem because the
Qββ value (3367.1 keV) is well above the 2615 keV γ-ray produced in the decay of 208Tl.

Radioactivity measurements for the other components of NEMO 3

•
As explained in Section 2.2.3, the Hamamatsu company was chosen to produce the low back-
ground PMTs, with very low contamination in all the components (glass, insulator, ceramics,
etc). In NEMO 3 the total mass of the PMTs is 239.2 kg for the 3” tubes and 346.5 kg for the
5” tubes, which yield the total activities presented in Table 4.

After selection of the PMTs, the other materials (except shields) were chosen if their total
activities in 40K, 214Bi and 208Tl were at most one tenth of the total activities for the PMTs.
It was not always possible to satisfy this criterion for all three contaminants simultaneously. If
40K exceeds the threshold, the material may have been accepted but not for 214Bi and 208Tl
which produce background events in the Qββ region. In Table 5 the measurements for all selected
components of a 5” PMT are summarized. The two last lines of this table provide a comparison
between the activity of the selected calorimeter materials and the total activity of the PMTs,
the ﬁrst one being at most of the same order as the PMTs.

Finally, to conclude the NEMO 3 radiopurity report, a summary of the radioactivity measure-

3 Performance of the detector

3.1 The simulation program

The NEMO 3 simulation program [20] has been developed in the framework of GEANT [21],
with the EUCLID industrial software and the EUCLID-GEANT interface [22]. The description
of the NEMO 3 device (geometric information, description of more than 60 materials and tracking
media) is given with 20 identical sectors, except for the source foils which are placed in their
exact positions inside the detector.

The event generator of the program, called GENBB, provides the possibility of generating diﬀer-
ent double beta decays (0ν, 2ν, Majorons). Also internal and external background events due to
decay of radioactive nuclei may be generated. This event generator also generates the kinematics
of special events, such as Compton scattering of external γ-rays or M¨oller scattering of external
electrons, thereby speeding up the computations compared to the simulated events with GEANT.

Important work has been done with the simulation of neutron interactions via the GEANT/MICAP
code [23]. This code tracks neutrons from 20 MeV to 10−5 eV. It also takes into account γ-ray
emission from (n,γ) captures and (n,n’γ) scatterings. Using the results of several tests done with
a Germanium detector and the NEMO 2 detector [19], the γ-ray generation subroutines were
improved by including additional spectroscopic information related to nuclei. Also a new library,
GAMLIB, was developed taking into account branching ratios down to as low as 0.1%. This
library takes into account the possibility of emission of conversion electrons, which is particularly
important for neutron captures with the large internal conversion coeﬃcients observed in many
nuclei. A comparison between the simulation and the data with a Am-Be neutron source, using
the magnetic ﬁeld and no shield, is presented in Fig. 9 and shows the excellent agreement for

high energy crossing electron events ecross (with Ee > 3.2 MeV) [24].

In Table 7, the experimental number of (ecrossNγ) events (with N
0) observed per hour without
a shield is compared to the expected number of events from simulations. These simulations take
into account the γ-ray ﬂux in the laboratory as well as thermal, epithermal and fast neutron
ﬂuxes, for which the respective proportions are given in this table. It was assumed that the
epithermal neutron ﬂux was equal to the thermal one. The resulting number of (2.19

observed events is compared to (2.05

very good with the γ-ray shield, which provides an attenuation factor of 3.2
0.4 with a 1200
rejection factor for γ-rays and a 100 one for thermal neutrons. The number of associated two-
4.4 for the
electron background events due to the neutron ﬂux, with the γ-ray shield, is 13.6
summed electron energies greater than 2.75 MeV [24]. Recollect that the experiment requires that
there be no external background. So there was the addition of the neutron shield, which provides
an attenuation factor of 70, which according to the simulation will suppress this background.

3.2 Trigger and data acquisition

3.2.1 Acquisition and data ﬁle building

Data transfer is achieved via a dedicated Ethernet. The EVB (400 MHz, with a Powerful Ethernet
controller) sends data event by event to a PC running Linux. In the transfer, Linux processes the
data by decoding it and re-organizing it into Random Access ZEBRA ﬁles. The initial format of
Cascade events uses a 12-byte header, followed by calorimeter and Geiger cell information with
variable lengths (two bytes per triggered PMT and three bytes per ﬁred cell), and ﬁnally a 3-byte
trailer. The ﬁnal format is an “ntuple” format for data analysis. The ntuple building is done on
the local acquisition disc and the Zebra ﬁle is written every 5000 events.

3.2.2 Trigger type properties

The ββ trigger conﬁguration

•

During the ββ runs, the trigger conﬁguration (see Section 2.4.3) is the two level one, which
enables the readout of events with at least one electron or electron-gamma event. The associated
counting rate is (7.4
0.1) Hz. This conﬁguration has the following properties. At least one
triggered scintillator is required with energy deposited greater than 150 keV. Next, a track is
reconstructed in a half-sector corresponding to the activation of Geiger cells in at least three of
the nine layers and at least two ﬁred cells in neighbouring layers (using at least two out of the
four layers near the source foil, the two intermediate layers, or at least two out of the three layers
near the scintillator wall).

±

The ββ trigger eﬃciency was estimated by applying trigger criteria to simulated signal and
background events with at least one ﬁred Geiger plane and at least one active PMT. The trigger
eﬃciency check was made with ββ0ν or ββ2ν events from the 100Mo source foils, 214Bi and
208Tl background events from the 100Mo source foils, and 214Bi decays in the gas. The number of
generated events for each type was 10000. The results are summarized in Table 8, for events with
at least one PMT or two PMTs. The proportion of accepted simulated events are given in the
ﬁrst and third columns for at least one and two PMT(s) respectively. The lost events are mainly
due to geometrical cuts. The proportion of accepted events after applying the trigger criteria are
given in the second and fourth columns. It represents the trigger eﬃciency (the error bars are
statistical uncertainties). The eﬃciency relative to the number of events with exactly two ﬁred
PMTs is the number between squared brackets in the last column. This study shows that trigger
criteria do not provide additional cuts and allows one to keep data for further analysis of all
interesting events. The trigger eﬃciency relative to the number of events with exactly two ﬁred
PMTs (criterium for ββ analysis) are 100% for ββ events (both 0ν and 2ν), 96.7% and 94% for
214Bi and 208Tl in the sources and 74.5% for 214Bi in the gas.

Results of simulations giving trigger eﬃciencies relative to the number of events coming from ββ0ν,
ββ2ν, 208Tl and 214Bi impurities from Molybdenum source foils and ﬁnally 214Bi impurities from gas.
The number of generated events for each case is 10000.

In the usual trigger conditions, dead time is due both to the 710 µs delay devoted to the search for
alpha particles and to the Geiger readout dead time, which is at least 587.5 µs for three triggered
Geiger cells. For each event the Geiger processor reads the 160 Geiger acquisition cards’ status
bits and ﬁve counters for each ﬁred cell. This is accomplished through a VICbus single read cycle
which needs 2.5 µs. Finally the interrupt handling and Cascade overhead take around 150 µs.
Thus a ββ event with two triggered PMTs and an average of 16 triggered Geiger cells has a dead
time of 1.5 ms (710+750 µs).

Other acquisition types

•
With the same trigger conﬁguration, one can have higher counting rates and lower dead times
using acquisition processes without looking for delayed events. It is however impossible to remove
the 710 µs ﬁxed delay, but the Geiger readout can begin with the calorimeter interrupt. In this
case the busy Geiger and the busy calorimeter are superimposed and the overlap is reduced to
about 200 µs, which gives a dead time of
1 ms.

It is possible to take data with just the calorimeter or just the tracking detector. For laser runs,
the counting rate is 250 Hz, with 10 Hz/PMT of that being the laser data, and the remainder
coming from 207Bi in the six reference counters.

Calibration runs with 60 207Bi sources use a ββ trigger, with an acquisition rate of 240 Hz.
Other calibration runs use only calorimeter acquisition, with a special one developed for 90Sr
to determine the beta end-point. The acquisition of only the energy spectra is realized without
ntuple building for the whole calorimeter, which permits very high counting rates (up to 30 kHz)
with the smaller output ﬁles of 32 Mbytes. All of the 32 Mbytes of the calorimeter processor are
used to construct histograms.

Counting rates associated with diﬀerent triggers and acquisition types are presented in Table 9.

3.2.3 Proportion of events in a ββ run

The combination of a tracking volume, delayed tracking electronics, calorimeter and a magnetic
ﬁeld allows NEMO 3 to identify electrons, positrons, γ-rays and α-particles. The characteristics
of events with these particles are outlined below.

electron (positron): one e− (e+) is reconstructed as a track, deﬁned by active Geiger cells
in time, with negative (positive) curvature starting from the source foil, passing through the
wire chamber and being detected by only one scintillator given that electrons and positrons
have a low probability of emitting bremsstrahlung γ-rays, which could trigger neighboring
scintillators.
alpha particle from the source foil: an α-particle is reconstructed as at least one delayed Geiger
cell near an electron or a positron vertex, or as a short straight track deﬁned with delayed hits

•

within 1.5 µs of each other and passing through a fraction of the wire chamber.
gamma: a γ-ray corresponds to one or two adjacent scintillators being triggered, without any
associated track and without a single Geiger cell hit in front of the scintillator. If there are two
active scintillators, they must have been simultaneously triggered, or equivalently their time
diﬀerences must be lower than the sum of their temporal resolutions.

Fig. 10 shows a typical two electron event coming from a molybdenum source foil (ββ2ν process).
In Figs. 11, 12, 13 and 14 one can see events characteristic of some contamination associated with
the detector: e−γγγ event, e+e− pair production, e−α event and a high energy crossing electron.

ﬁgure shows the transverse top view of NEMO 3, while the right part presents the associated longitudinal
view. The circles radii correspond to the transverse distance from the anode wire for each ﬁred cell, they
are not error bars. The electrons have energies of 1029 keV (internal wall) and 750 keV (external wall).

Fig. 14. Example of an external source of background: it is a view of high energy crossing electron,
which is most likely produced by a γ-ray emitted after a neutron capture in the copper frame. This
type of events is used to establish reconstruction formulae for transverse and longitudinal positions
in the tracking detector. It can be distinguished from back-to-back source foil events by time-of-ﬂight
measurements (see Section 3.4).

The proportion of diﬀerent types of events in a ββ run is given in Table 10. Note that ββ-like
events represent 0.15% of the registered events, which means one ββ-like event occurs every
1.5 minute. Events which are not recorded come from electron backscatterring at the scintillators
or other mechanism which drive electrons back to the source foil.

There were eventually only 30 channels of the 6180 (< 0.5%) with missing anode signals, of which
there were four cells disconnected due to anode wires in contact with ground wires, eight cells
due to interconnection problems, and 18 hot cells 13 (
0.3%). The number of Geiger cells with
at least one missing cathode signal were 160 (2.6%), due again to interconnection problems.

∼

3.3.2 Geiger TDC analysis

As discussed in Section 2.4 there are four variables associated with the Geiger TDCs. They are
tdcLC and tdcHC for the two cathode ring times, tdcA for the anode time and tdcα for the delayed
time (see Eq. 6 to Eq. 9). The triggered Geiger cells are classiﬁed into diﬀerent types according to
the values of these four TDC signals. There are “in-time hits” coming from electron or positron
tracks. Also “delayed hits” are delayed triggers of cells used to study α-particle events. Finally
there are “reﬁred cells” which are active because of cross-talk (cells ﬁred by a neighboring in-time
cell) and “noisy cells”.

3.3.3 Track reconstruction

Principle

•

Geiger events are ﬁrst tagged with one of the four previously deﬁned criteria. The reﬁred and
noisy cells are rejected, with about one or two reﬁred cells per event. The number of noisy cells is
typically negligible. Then, two diﬀerent pattern recognition and track ﬁt procedures are carried
out, one for in-time hits and the other for delayed hits.

For in-time hits the pattern recognition and tracking are carried out using a cellular automaton
algorithm, which was previously used for NEMO 2 tracking [25]. The NEMO 3 algorithm uses a
set of consecutive segments which connect pairs of active cells in neighboring layers. A candidate
track is deﬁned and characterized by the number of segments (length of the track) and the sum of
the angles between the segments. In NEMO 3, the longest track is favored. The curvature of the
track depends on the magnetic ﬁeld. A new track search is then begun with the other segments
until there are not enough segments remaining to construct a track.

Concerning the track ﬁtting procedure, there are two successive ﬁts in order to solve the left/right
ambiguities in the transverse plane.
Each reconstructed track is extrapolated to the source foil and a vertex position is calculated
whose transverse and longitudinal coordinates are Rφ and Z, with an origin Z = 0 at the vertical
center position of the source foils. φ is the polar angle, using cylindrical coordinates, with an origin

13 self-discharging Geiger cell

at sector 0; R = 155.5 cm is the transversal distance between the detector’s center and the source
foils; for sector 00, the Rφ value for the calibration source position is (148.6
0.1) cm and there
is a step of 18 degrees to obtain Rφ for each subsequent sector. In the similar fashion, the track is
projected onto an associated scintillator surface and the calculated coordinates of the scintillator
are RSφS and ZS, where RS is the transversal distance between the detector’s center and the
entrance surface of the scintillator.
For delayed hits the treatment in the longitudinal plane is the same as that for in-time hits.
The treatment in the transverse plane is slightly modiﬁed since there are only relative drift time
measurements. Delayed hits can form a track only if the diﬀerences in anode times are shorter
than 1.5 µs, which is approximately the maximum drift time in a Geiger cell. For each hit, the
drift distance is computed from the tdcα for the cell, assuming the delayed hit with the higher
tdcα value corresponds to a particle passing through the anode wire of the cell.

±

Association between tracks and energy deposited in the calorimeters

An electron or positron event needs track associated with a scintillator. This is accomplished if
there is at least one hit in the two Geiger cell layers nearest to the scintillators which belongs to
the track. Additionaly, geometrical cuts are applied which extrapolate the position of the track
to the surface of the scintillator (RSφS and ZS) which has to be located less than 3 cm away
from the edges of the scintillator.

3.3.4 Reconstruction of the particle position in the cell

Studies with a laser and a nine cell prototype of the tracking detector were carried out to establish
formulae giving transverse (r⊥) and longitudinal (z) positions in a cell from anode drift times
and both cathode times [26]. These formulae have been improved with NEMO 3 [27], using data
taken with high energy crossing electrons (> 4.5 MeV). These electrons were created by an intense
105 n/s. Fast neutrons
Am-Be source producing fast neutrons with an activity of around 2.2
are thermalized in the scintillators; then high energy γ-rays are created by the capture of the
neutrons in the copper walls, producing one-crossing-electron events by the Compton eﬀect. With
high energy crossing electrons and with an energy deposited > 3 MeV in the second scintillator,
the multiple scattering is found to be negligible and the track is well deﬁned.

×

The track resulting from the ﬁt is assumed to be identical to the real track. Thus, the transverse
and longitudinal reconstruction formulae are obtained by comparing the distance to the identiﬁed
track with the drift anode time and the two cathode times.

Transverse position in the cell

Fig. 15 shows the transverse distance r⊥ to the track as a function of the anode time tA. Near
the wire (between 1 and 4.5 mm), the drift velocity corresponds to the saturation regime and is
2.3 cm/µs. Far from the anode wire, the drift speed is proportional to the electric ﬁeld. Thus, for
220 < tA < 1480 ns, the electric ﬁeld is proportional to 1/r, which leads to a transversal distance
proportional to √tA.

Longitudinal position in the cell

According to the two measured cathode times tLC and tHC, and using the origin of the z axis

ﬁxed at the vertical center of the cells, the longitudinal position z is given, in mm, by:

where Lef f = 2607 mm is the eﬀective length of the cell, which is lower than the full cell length of
2700 mm that includes the two rings (each is 30 mm long). This eﬀective length is a consequence
of the fact that cathode signals exceed their threshold a few centimeters before the plasma reaches
the cathode ring. The Lef f value depends on the HV and gas mixture.

Anode time (in ns)

The ﬁrst order term corresponds to a constant propagation speed for the plasma. In this case, the
longitudinal position is simply the propagation time of the plasma to the nearest ring, divided
by the propagation velocity.

The second order term is a correction, which takes into account the reduced propagation velocity
due to a decrease in the high voltage during the plasma propagation (this factor also depends
on the HV and gas mixture). The correction has a maximum value of around 20 mm in two
positions corresponding respectively to 25% and 75% of the cell length.

If one of the two cathode times is missing, the relation remains the same, but only for the TDC
with a non-zero value. The other cathode time is obtained using an average plasma propagation
velocity. The z position in the Geiger cell is then reconstructed using the same formula as above.

The propagation velocity has to be calculated and stored in the database for each Geiger cell.
If both cathode times are missing, no reconstruction of the z position of the Geiger cell hit is
possible.

Transverse and longitudinal resolution of the Geiger cells [27]

•

The residual distribution in the transverse direction is obtained by plotting the distance between
the accepted track and the reconstructed position of the Geiger cell hit, using high energy crossing
electrons. The full-width at half maximum (F W HM) of the spectrum is used to compute the
transverse resolution of the cells as σ⊥ = F W HM/2.35. The average value of this resolution is:

σ⊥ = 0.5 mm

∼

Note that σ⊥/R

contribution of multiple scattering, a study of the transverse resolution was carried out as a
function of the variable √Ltrack/E, where Ltrack is the track length and E is the initial energy of
the electron in keV (see Fig. 16). The associated relation, which shows the resolution dependence
with multiple scattering, is:

3.3.5 Misidentiﬁcation of electrons and positrons [27]

There is a possible misidentiﬁcation of electrons and positrons in tests with high energy (
≥
3 MeV) crossing electrons which are produced during neutron source studies. These crossing
events are dominated (> 99%) by electrons and are reconstructed as two half-sector electron-type
events with successive negative curvature. The ﬁrst half from an external scintillator to the source
foil on one side of the foil, the second one from the source foil to an internal scintillator, both with
a common vertex on the foil. Thus it is possible to check the probability of mistaking a positive
curvature positron event against an electron event after the foil. The associated distribution of the
rate of error as a function of the electron energy is presented in Fig. 19. The e+e− misidentiﬁcation
is around 3% at 1 MeV using extrapolated results.

3.3.6 The vertex reconstruction [27]

Principle

•
The quality of vertex reconstruction has been analyzed by taking data with 60 207Bi sources
placed in the three positions (T for Top with Z = 90 cm, C for Center with Z = 0 cm, and B for
Bottom with Z =
90 cm) on each sector inside the calibration tubes. The Rφ and Z positions
of these sources (see Section 3.3.3) are known with an accuracy of 1 mm.

Conversion electron events coming from these sources are selected, with energies of 482 keV
or 976 keV. The distribution of the 60 reconstructed vertices are presented in Fig. 20. With
this sample of data the diﬀerences between reconstructed and expected vertex positions can be
estimated. The diﬀerence in the transverse plane is deﬁned as ∆Rφ = Rφrec −
Rφexp and in the
Zexp.
longitudinal plane as ∆Z = Zrec −
For transverse reconstruction of the vertex, the diﬀerences are the same on average for the three
source positions (T, C and B):

∆Rφ = 1.6 mm

These ∆Rφ are compatible with the accuracy of Rφ positions and with the tranverse resolution
σRφ of the vertex.

The average diﬀerences in the longitudinal reconstuction for the three positions are the following:

∆Z(T ) =

±

Note the maximum value of ∆Z is lower than the longitudinal vertex resolution. The longitudinal
position of the vertex is independent of the angle. However, an asymmetry for the three positions
is observed, which corresponds to an error of around 20 ns on the cathode time measurement. It
can be explained by the fact that the same discrimination threshold was used for both cathode
signals although the high cathode signal is lower.

Fig. 20. Distribution of reconstructed vertices for the 60 positions of the calibration 207Bi sources, in
the one-electron channel.

Vertex resolution

•
The transverse resolution σRφ depends on the energy of the track. Using the two conversion
electron energy values (
1 MeV), it is possible to determine average values for
these resolutions:

0.5 MeV and

∼

∼

σRφ(0.5 MeV) = 0.3 cm and

σRφ(1 MeV) = 0.2 cm

The longitudinal resolution σZ depends on both energy and position. Using 1 MeV electrons,
the same value of σZ = 0.7 cm was obtained for both T and B positions and σZ = 0.9 cm was
obtained for the C position. For 0.5 MeV electrons, the longitudinal resolution is σZ = 1.1 cm
on average for the T and B positions and 1.3 cm for the C position.

There is another dependence on the dip angle θ (see Fig. 21), which obeys the relation:

Study with two electrons events

•
The ββ analysis reconstructs events with two tracks coming from the same vertex. Thus, it
is important to study the vertex resolution of the two electron channel in order to check the
measured transverse and longitudinal dispersions. These dispersions, δRφ and δZ, are deﬁned as
the distance between the vertices associated with the two reconstructed tracks.

Using events coming from the 60 207Bi sources with two simultaneous electrons (intensity of

2%), one builds δRφ and δZ distributions, which produce the resolutions:

∼

σ(δRφ) = 0.6 cm

and

σ(δZ) = 1.0 cm

It is also true that σ(δRφ) = 0.1 cm, if one constrains the two tracks to have a common vertex.
These resolutions allow one to make a distinction between two strips in a source foil in a given
sector, which is crucial for sectors composed of diﬀerent sources.

The calibration lines obtained from the two 207Bi peaks as well as the ﬁt combining 207Bi and

is given in Fig. 24.

The two-electron events from 207Bi sources are used for time alignment with electrons and to
obtain the time resolution as a function of electron energy as shown in Fig. 26. This resolution
is around 250 ps for 1 MeV electrons.

The energy dependence of the timing signal is adjusted by a four parameter formula, as shown
in Eq. 13. The ﬁrst method to ﬁnd this dependence is to use a “complete” laser run. A second
is to use the two-electron events from 207Bi sources. The results of this second method for the
diﬀerent types of scintillators are plotted in Fig. 27.

The time-of-ﬂight (TOF) selection criterion

•
To distinguish between one-crossing-electron events from external background and two-electron
events from the source foil, the same TOF rejection criterion is applied that was used in the
NEMO 2 experiment [4]. It is based on the comparison of the measured TOF (∆Tmeas) with
the calculated ones. A single electron crosses the detector in a time (∆Tcal)ext and two electrons
emitted from the source foil have a TOF equal to (∆Tcal)int.

3.4.4 Counter stability

For each counter, there are stability corrections which are calculated using the absolute calibration
obtained with sources as a reference and laser spectra. These corrections take into account any
variation of the laser, which is monitored by reference PMTs. This variation measurement is

determined by comparing the laser peak position and the 976 keV peak position from the 207Bi
for the six reference counters (see Section 2.5.6).

An example of a long term (one month) survey of the energy correction parameter (ecorr) for
one counter is shown in Fig. 29. This stable behaviour with gain variations of less than 2% is
consistent with 90% of the counters with 5” PMTs and 96% with 3” PMTs. These corrections
are stored in the database and used with ββ runs to calculate particle energies.

4 Conclusion

The NEMO 3 experiment is based on the direct detection of the two electrons emitted from double
beta decay isotopes, with the detector and the source of the double beta decay being independent.
This allows the collaboration to study seven ββ isotopes simultaneously. The isotopes which are
distributed among 20 sectors are 100Mo, 82Se, 130Te, 116Cd, 150Nd, 96Zr and 48Ca. A calorimeter
made of large blocks of scintillators coupled to very low radioactivity PMTs permits one to
measure the energies of electrons, positrons, gamma-rays and also their time-of-ﬂight, which
are used to reject events from external backgrounds. In addition of a tracking volume with
delayed tracking electronics for identiﬁcation of alpha particles coming from 214Bi decay, a 25
Gauss magnetic ﬁeld allows three-dimensional track reconstruction of charged particles. Thus the
NEMO 3 detector is able to identify electrons, positrons, γ-rays and α-particles and to detect
multi-particle events in the energy domain of natural radioactivity. Using registered events in
the e−γ, e−γγ, e−γγγ and e−αγ channels for backgrounds studies, the NEMO 3 detector is able
to characterize and measure its own background, which can be subtracted from the two-electron
signal.

The main objective of the NEMO 3 experiment is to search for neutrinoless double beta decay. To
avoid the high energy region of natural radioactivity the ββ0ν isotopes are selected for their high
Qββ value. Every attempt has been made to minimize internal backgrounds in the ββ0ν sources
by puriﬁcation of the enriched samples as well to suppress external backgrounds using shields
and by carefully selecting all the detector materials. The tail of the ββ2ν decay distribution
troublesomely overlaps the ββ0ν distribution as a function of the energy resolution. It is the
unavoidable background for neutrinoless double beta decay studies.

The NEMO 3 detector has been running in the Fr´ejus Underground Laboratory in nearly optimal
conditions since mid-February 2003. Fig. 30 and Fig. 31 reﬂect the performance of the detector.
The ﬁrst shows the distribution of the summed two electron energies of ββ2ν events measured for
the molybdenum sources (background substracted). The data sample corresponds to 650 hours
of data for the runs from mid-February to the end of March 2003. The number of events is
13750, with a signal-to-background ratio of 40:1. The second ﬁgure presents the experimental
angular distribution for the two emitted electrons in molybdenum sources. The same data for the
summed energy and angular distribution are shown with the ββ2ν Monte-Carlo calculation. The
high statistics of the data will allow for detailed checks of the models used for the Monte-Carlo
calculation.

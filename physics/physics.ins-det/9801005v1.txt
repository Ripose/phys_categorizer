scintillator areas with precise timing

Abstract. Using scintillator tile technology several square meters of plastic scintillator
are read out by only two photomultipliers with a time precision of about 1.5 nsec. Two
examples are discussed to build a detector based on this technology to search for cosmic
muons and neutrinos.

INTRODUCTION

The readout of plastic scintillators is done classically using adiabatic clear light
guides to focus the produced photons to the photocathode of a photomultiplier
(PM). Later wavelength shifting rods were applied to collect the light of larger
scintillator areas. In recent years wavelength shifting ﬁbers have been used to read
out scintillator tiles of preshowers or calorimeter moduls [1,2,3].

Precise timing normally demands a large number of photons to be produced in
the scintillator. Using two photomultipliers at both ends of not too large scintillator
rods and a meantimer for the output signals a time precision of a few hundred psec is
in reach. For large scintillator areas this method is rather expensive because many
photomultipliers are needed. Using wavelength shifting ﬁbers for the scintillator
read out has the clear disadvantage that only a few percent of the produced light
will be trapped to the PM photocathode. Nevertheless we will propose in the
following a method to read out large detector areas with a few photomultipliers
retaining a time precision of about 1 nsec.

THE MEASURING PRINCIPLE

The basic piece of a large scale detector is a small scintillator tile of about 25
x 25 x 2 cm3 as schematically drawn in ﬁg. 1. Two groups of wavelength shifting
ﬁbers are glued into grooves at it’s surface. These ﬁbers are connected to clear

optical ﬁbers of a length of several meters guiding the light produced by crossing
particles to two photomultipliers. A particle hit is registrated if both PM’s give a
coincident signal above a certain threshold and within a short time window. This
demand reduces already the PM noise by orders of magnitude.

Several scintillator tiles are combined by summing up the clear read out ﬁbers
of each of the two groups (see ﬁg. 2). A natural restriction is given only by the
size of the photocatode of the used PM’s in relation to the number and size of the
ﬁbers per tile. For a 2” PM with homogeneous response of the whole photocathode
about 100 tiles can be combined to more than 6 m2 detector area if four ﬁbers of
1.5 mm diameter per tile and group are used.

RESULTS FOR SINGLE TILES

For the construction of tiles we used diﬀerent types of scintillator of 1 - 2 cm
thickness.The ﬁbers tested came mainly from BICRON2. Finally we used the fast
wavelength shifting ﬁber BCF 92 with a decay constant of 2.7 nsec together with
2 m long clear ﬁbers BCF 98 both with 1.5 mm diameter.

Several ﬁber arrangements were tested using between 2 and 8 ﬁbers per group.
An optimum was found for four ﬁbers per group equally distributed over the tile
surface. The ﬁbers were coupled to two Philips3 photomultipliers XP 2020 which
were read out by charge sensitive ADC’s. Two additional scintillation counters
on top and bottom of the tile studied are used to trigger for throughgoing cosmic
particles. The eﬃciencies derived from measured ADC-spectra are given in the
table for a 1 cm thick tile made from BICRON 408 together with those for a 2 cm
thick scintillator produced at IHEP Serpukhov. In both cases values near to 99 %
are found for the tile hit eﬃciency. The light output increases by about a factor
1.5 if double clad ﬁbers are used.

Keeping in mind, that the two time measurements are independent of each other
we derive from their diﬀerence a time resolution of ∼ 1.5 nsec for the single channel
signal. The timing behaviour of the scintillator signals was studied using TDC’s

which provide a time resolution of 100 psec. The TDC’s are read out in common
stop mode. The stop signal is derived from a coincidence of the signals of the two
ﬁber groups of a tile using very low thresholds of about 5 mV.

FIRST APPLICATIONS

A t0–detector for the L3COSMIC-Project

Two years ago the idea was born to use this technology for a 50 m2 scintillation
detector to be installed on top of the L3 experiment at CERN4. This will allow to
use the muon drift chambers of this experiment to measure cosmic particle momenta
because a precise t0-signal will be available. As discussed already since long [4] a
rich spectrum of cosmic particle physics could be investigated in this L3COSMIC
experiment. The time resolution demanded for a ± 1 % measurement of the cosmic
muon momentum spectrum between 20 GeV and 1 TeV is about 1 – 2 nsec just in
reach for the proposed device.

The detector will consist of 8 modules of 6 m2 each. The ﬁrst module has been
constructed at DESY-Zeuthen and tested in detail with cosmic particles. The tiles
have a size of 25 x 25 x 2 cm3, therefore 96 of them are needed for a full size
module. Half of the tiles were produced from Serpukhov scintillator, the other half
from already used one delivered by the University of Michigan5. For the read out
1.5 mm double clad ﬁbers BCF 92 and BCF 98 were taken.

The results of our measurements are given in ﬁgs. 3 and 4 for the hit eﬃciency

and the time resolution respectively. Average values of

ε12 = 98.3 ± 0.7 % and σt = 1.4 ± 0.1 nsec

demonstrate that we have reached the design goal.

Each 16 tiles are dense packed inside an aluminium box to cover an area of 1 m2.
Six of the boxes are assembled together to form a full size module (see ﬁg. 5). The
geometrical arrangement is done in a way that a 6 m2 area is ﬁlled without gaps
allowing to put the two times 6 ﬁber bundles to the two XP 2020 photomultipliers
for the read out. Practically this coupling is done using a special mask arrangement
Because the mask covers the whole surface of the PM’s photocathode one has to
make sure equal sensitivity of the PM independent of the ﬁber position. The high
voltage divider used allows a correponding adjustment. The result is presented
for one PM in ﬁg. 6. The full size module has been tested ﬁrst in Zeuthen using
small (10 x 10 cm2) scintillator paddles to allow position dependent cosmic particle
triggering. We found an average hit eﬃciency of 99.1 ± 0.4 % and an average time
resolution of 1.4 ± 0.1 nsec.

Two testruns have been performed in autumn 96 and spring 97 at CERN. A 3
m2 and a 6 m2 detector respectively were installed on top of the L3–magnet. Data

were taken in coincidence with the barrel scintillator system of L3. Two TDC’s
of this system and the L3-DAQ were used to measure the arrival time of crossing
particles as seen by the PM’s of the t0-detector module. With this arrangement we
got a time resolution of σt = 1.5 ± 0.1 nsec which conﬁrms the laboratory results.

A Scintillator based cosmic Particle detection Yard (SPY)

The read out scheme described in section 2 has ﬁrst been proposed for a cosmic
neutrino detector project at earth surface. The aim was twofold. First, we wanted
to detect high energetic air showers from above as well as ”astrophysical” neutrinos
from below the ground. Second, easy construction and installation was demanded
allowing 100 % access for maintainance and exchange of components avoiding the
extreme boundary conditions of present cosmic neutrino detection techniques [5,6].
The idea was to use modern scintillator technology to build a fast detector, well
structured to keep the tremendous background from normal cosmic rays small.
Basic elements of such a detector could be scintillator sheets made out of tiles
forming a three ﬂoor tower (see ﬁg. 7). Deﬁning a hit as a coincidence of the two
photomultipliers of one sheet as described above, a track is identiﬁed by a delayed
coincidence of hits of all three planes. A sheet size of 4 x 4 m2 would have to cope
with a cosmic ray rate of about 4 kHz. A distance of 25 m between every two sheets
seems to allow to do that without demanding an extreme time precision from the
scintillator signal. The background rate per tower would be reduced to 6.4 Hz.

A large area detector could be build grouping many towers dense to each other.
With 25 x 25 towers of the described size a total area of 10 000 m2 is reached. The
detector could measure naturally also inclined tracks. In this case the expected time
delay would depend on the particle direction. Predicting hit positions in the second
plane from those in the ﬁrst and the last one would allow to keep the background
still limited to the extension of one sheet size.

Monte Carlo calculations supported the above concept. However one has to
handle a background rate of about 1011 per year which is diﬃcult to simulate.
Therefore we decided to build a small scale prototype detector (µ–SPY) at DESY-
Zeuthen. Three planes of 1 m2 size divided in four subsections were installed in a
distance of about 10m between every two of them. The ﬁbers of each plane were
read out with eight channels of a sixteen channel Philips R4760 photomultiplier.
The time resolution per plane was measured comparing hit arrival times of multihit
triggers. It was found to be about 3 – 4 nsec and depends mainly on the quality
of the used PM. For the data acquisition we used a OS9 based VME–system. The
hit data were collected in a tandem buﬀer.
If full, it was transfered to a SUN
workstation where track reconstruction was done online. A data reduction factor
of 104 was reached.

In 176 days we observed 4.8 x 109 hits. After the online ﬁlter we found 281.553
events with 324.034 tracks.The time diﬀerences between planes one–two and two–
three are shown in correlation to each other in ﬁg. 9. A clear enhancement is

observed for normal cosmic rays crossing the detector from above. A very small
number of hits is found in the opposite direction, as can be seen from ﬁg. 8.
Assuming the worst case, a ﬂat background in the region of hits from neutrino
interactions from below, we ﬁnd a density of ρbg = 0.009 events/1 nsec2 for 1 m2
and 1 year of running. Extrapolating this number to a 10 000 m2 detector we would
get a signal to noise ratio of S/N = 0.5 for atmospheric neutrinos above 2 GeV.
We have to show however, that the hit prediction for the second plane works for a
detector of this size.

SUMMARY

It has been demonstrated, that small size scintillator tiles read out with two bun-
dles of wavelength shifting ﬁbers coupled by clear ﬁbers of several meters length to
standard photomultipliers allow to detect the crossing of minimum ionizing parti-
cles with about 99 % eﬃciency and a timing precision of 1.5 nsec.

A dense pack of many of these tiles gives the possibility to read out considerable
large detector areas with only a few photomultipliers. Because all ﬁbers of all tiles
have the same length the properties of the detector are completely determined by
the single tile behaviour independent of the position of a crossing particle.

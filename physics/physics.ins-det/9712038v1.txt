Introduction

This paper reports on the development of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector for LHC-B. The LHC-B
experiment is a proposed single arm spectrometer for the LHC optimised for B physics. Particle identiﬁcation is
crucial for the study of B-physics and CP violation at the LHC. The many B-meson decay modes to be studied
makes it necessary to have π/K separation over a momentum range of 1 < p < 150 GeV/c. This reduces the
background of the selected ﬁnal state and, in addition, provides an eﬃcient ﬂavour tag of the signal B-meson.
The overall concept and performance of LHC-B is discussed in more detail elsewhere in these proceedings [1].

RICH detectors meet the experimental criteria for particle identiﬁcation in the required momentum range.
It is proposed to use two RICH detectors in the LHC-B experiment, see ﬁg 1. The upstream detector (RICH1),
ﬁg. 2, has a combined gas and aerogel radiator and is situated in front of the dipole magnet. The aerogel radiator
is placed against the entrance window of the second gaseous (C4F10) radiator. A spherical mirror with a radius
of curvature of 190 cm is tilted by ≈ 250 mrad to reﬂect the Cherenkov light onto an array of photodetectors
situated outside the experimental acceptance. The downstream RICH (RICH2), ﬁg. 2, uses CF4 as its radiator
with a spherical mirror with a radius of curvature of 820 cm tilted by 370 mrad. An additional ﬂat mirror is
tilted by 240 mrad to bring the Cherenkov photons out of the acceptance of the experiment.

Each RICH detector has two photodetector planes giving a total area of 2.9 m2. The chosen detector
technology must have a high quantum eﬃciency, a spatial resolution of at least 2.5 × 2.5 mm2 and to have a
fast readout consistent with 25 ns bunch crossing of the LHC. Two candidate technologies exists [3]: hybrid
photodiodes (HPDs) and multianode photomultipliers. These detectors are commercially available but not
in designs that meet the experimental needs of LHC-B. A program of R&D is currently underway on the
development of a HPD with a large active area.

2 HPD development

Two complimentary approaches to the development of the HPDs are being investigated: the ‘pixel HPD’, which
uses the bump bonding of a silicon pixel detector to a readout chip, and the ‘pad HPD’ where a silicon pad
detector is readout using routing lines wire-bonded to front-end chips around its circumference.

2.1 Pixel HPD

The pixel HPD is being developed in close collaboration with DEP [4]. It is based on standard image intensiﬁer
technology that strongly focuses photoelectrons onto a segmented silicon pixel array. The feasibility of this
approach has already been demonstrated with the ‘IPSA-tube’ [5]. Work is ongoing on a scale model prototype
with an active photocathode diameter of 40 mm and an anode diameter of 11 mm. The anode is assembled with
the LHC1 chip developed at CERN [6]. This chip contains a detector array of 2048 pixels, 50 × 500µm2 in size
and it has a lowest achievable comparator threshold of 4000e− with a spread of 1000e−. Unfortunately these
detector properties are not compatible with the needs of LHC-B. In particular, the pixel dimension (50µm) is too
small compared to the RICH granularity ( 500×500µm2). Nor are the the threshold properties of the LHC1 chip
compatible with LHC-B requirements, though recent development in pixel electronics have achieved comparator
thresholds down to 1400e− with an RMS of 90e−. The speciﬁc needs of LHC-B are being investigated.

2.2 Pad HPD

The pad HPD will be housed in a cylindrical glass envelope capped with a UV-glass entrance window with
a K2CsSb photocathode. A visible light photocathode deposition facility that allows a high vacuum seal of
the HPD baseplate onto the metal ﬂange of the glass envelope has been designed. The ﬁnal assembly of this
apparatus was performed at CERN at the end of 1997. The signal from the photoelectrons in the silicon sensor
will be detected by front end chips placed around the edge of the sensor via wires bonded to the routing lines
from the pad. Focussing electrodes, ﬁxed in the glass envelope, will demagnify the image by a factor of 2.3.
The 2048 pad silicon detector contains pads of dimensions 1mm2. Successful tests have been performed on
the sensor with photoelectrons up to 20 keV with (the non LHC speed) VA3 chip [7]. A signal/noise ratio of
≈ 10 has been achieved. Earlier tests with a 256 pad sensor had achieved a signal/noise ratio of ≈ 18. This
diﬀerence is under investigation, but one possible reason for this degradation in performance is diﬀerences in
the manufacturing of the wafer.

The SCT-128A [8] analogue chip which was developed for the ATLAS silicon tracker is being modiﬁed to
achieve a noise level of ∼ 600e−. Additional modiﬁcations will be needed to meet the requirements of the pad
HPD for LHC-B, in particular the multiplexing properties of the chip.

3 RICH Prototype

A prototype of the downstream RICH detector was tested in the T9 test beam at the CERN SPS during
the Spring and Summer of 1997. A planar array of seven 61-pixel HPD’s from DEP were used to detect the

Cherenkov photons produced in aerogel, air and C4F10 radiators. In conﬁguration-1, ﬁg. 3, of the prototype
the light is focussed by a 240 mm focal length mirror which corresponds to a 1/4 scale of the RICH1 detector.
A full scale prototype (conﬁguration 2) was also used which has a 1143 mm mirror to focus rings from C4F10
onto an array of six 61-pixel HPD’s. This was achieved by adding extension arms to conﬁguration 1.

The 61 pixel HPD has a silicon diode detector segmented as a hexagonal array with pad dimensions of 2 mm
face-to-face. The HPD was operated at a high voltage of 12kV. Using a pulsed light emitting diode the complete
readout and data acquisition chain was tested. The pedestal, the single, double and triple photoelectrons peaks
were clearly visible with a signal/noise ratio of ≈ 5.7. Most of this noise is associated with the input capacitance
of the feedthrough and printed circuit boards.

The test beam provides charged particles of either polarity and the momentum can be tuned in the range
2 − 15.5 GeV/c. The particle type is identiﬁed by measuring the signal pulse height from a CO2 threshold
Cherenkov counter installed 30 m upstream from the prototype. The prototype vessel was aligned with the
beam axis. Charged particles which provide the trigger are selected using using scintillation counters, two
upstream and two downstream of the vessel. A photoelectron hit is deﬁned to be a HPD pixel with a signal
pulse height 4σ above the pedestal mean, where σ is the rms width of the pedestal peak.

Using RICH conﬁguration 1, data were taken with a 10 GeV/c negatively charged beam with 18 mm thickness
of aerogel. Fig. 4 shows an arc of a ring on the central HPD, whose radius is compatible with that expected
from C4F10. The outer HPD’s clearly exhibit a ring which originates from the aerogel radiator.

The number of photoelectrons per triggered event was measured for all three radiators in the vessel. For this
analysis a threshold of 3σ was set for individual pixels and multiple photoelectrons were taken into account. The
mean number of photoelectrons are shown in table 1. The partial geometrical coverage of the aerogel and gas
rings was calculated from simulation with ≈ 5% uncertainity. The expected photoelectron yields was calculated
from simulation which included the properties of the aerogel, mirror and photocathode eﬃciencies. The overall
precision in the expected yield is estimated to be 15%. The comparison between observed and expected yields
are given in table 1. The numbers from this preliminary analysis are compatible within 30%.

comparison with the expected yield.

The full scale RICH1 prototype was studied using conﬁguration-2. The longer focal length of the mirror
means the C4F10 ring now spans the outer 6 HPDs. The event display shown in ﬁg. 5 is obtained from negatively
charged 15.5 GeV/c momentum beam. The K : π ratio of the triggering particles has been enhanced to 1 : 2
using the threshold Cherenkov counter. Fig. 5 shows segments of two rings; an inner ring from the incident
kaons and an outer ring from the pions. It can be seen that the number of hits observed in HPD 3 is lower than

in HPD 4. (Similarly HPD 5 has fewer hits than HPD 2.) This is because HPD’s 3 and 5 have mylar windows
in front of their photocathodes which absorb the UV photons.

4 Summary

The major outstanding issue for the LHC-B RICH detector is the demonstration of a photodetector that matches
LHC-B requirements. For the pixel HPD it is envisaged to produce and test a 80 mm diameter tube whilst
a pixel chip is developed in parallel that meets the experimental needs. Test in 1998 are planned for the pad
HPD using the 2048 pad detector under vacuum with the designed focussing and then eventually with a bialkali
photocathode.

The RICH prototype tests have been successful. Clear Cherenkov rings from gas and aerogel radiators have
been observed for the ﬁrst time using HPD’s as photon detectors. The preliminary measured photon yields are
compatible within 30% of expectations based on simulations. Further analysis of the data is investigating the
reconstruction resolution of the Cherenkov angle for each recorded hit from both the gas and aerogel radiators.
It is also planned to use the RICH

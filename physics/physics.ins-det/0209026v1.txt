CALORIMETER

ON BEHALF OF THE H1 COLLABORATION

The jet calibration of the Liquid-Argon-Calorimeter of the H1 Detector at HERA
is described. In the measurement of high jet transverse energies systematic uncer-
tainties as low as 2% can be reached in deep inelastic scattering with a high photon
virtuality (Q2) and in photoproduction. Furthermore, the concept of a new energy
weighting scheme of H1 is presented. First applications with a high Q2 neutral
current deep inelastic scattering sample show that the resolution of the balance in
transverse momentum between the hadronic system and the electron is improved.

1. Introduction

In the H1 Experiment1 at HERA a Liquid Argon (LAr) Calorimeter is used
to measure the energies of particles emerging from the interaction of 27.5 GeV
positron (or electron) and 920 GeV (or 820 GeV) proton beams over an angular
range of 4o ≤ θ ≤ 154o.a

The H1 Liquid Argon Calorimeter2 is a non-compensating sampling
calorimeter which is divided into 8 self supporting wheels each built out of
8 octants in the barrel part or two half shells in the forward part.
It con-
sists of electromagnetic and outer hadronic sections. In the electromagnetic
modules lead is used as absorber material which adds up to 20 – 30 radiation
lengths (X0). The hadronic part is built out of stainless steel absorber plates
which corresponds to a total of 4.5 – 8 interaction lengths (λ) including the
electromagnetic section.

aH1 uses a right-handed coordinate system, where the direction of the proton beam deﬁnes
the positive z-direction. The polar angle θ is measured with respect to this direction.

2. Calorimeter Calibration using H1 Physics Data

Knowledge of the LAr calorimeter energy scale can be improved using neutral
current (NC) deep inelastic scattering (DIS) physics data in oﬀ-line analysis.
With the increased amount of data collected in the past years the precision in
this calibration method has reached the design level.

2.1. Energy calibration with DIS data

The over-constrained kinematics of NC DIS events at HERA allow the predic-
tion of the energy Ee of the scattered electronb from the electron beam energy
Ee−beam, the scattering angle of the electron θe and the eﬀective angle of the
ﬁnal state θ with the double angle method (DA)3:

Ee(θe, θ) =

2 · Ee−beam · sin θ
sin θe + sin θ − sin(θe + θ)

.

(1)

The remaining ﬁnal state can be a hadronic shower (DIS-DA) or a pho-
ton (QED-Compton-DA). Using the predicted energies Ee, position dependent
calibration factors for the electromagnetic scale are derived.

The hadronic energy scale can be adjusted using the known electron energy.
The scale correction factors for the electromagnetic and hadronic sections are
obtained wheelwise from the ratio of transverse momenta of the calibrated
electron and the hadronic ﬁnal state.

The uncertainty of the hadronic energy scale is deﬁned by the diﬀerence
between the correction factors in data and Monte Carlo simulation. As can
be seen in Fig. 1, the uncertainties are below 2% in a wide angular range of

calorimeter acceptance. Larger deviations can be found in the backward part
where mostly low energy hadrons are accepted and where energy leakage occurs
due to the missing hadronic section in the most backward wheel.

2.2. Dijet Data in Photoproduction

The calibration procedure obtained from DIS data is applied to the measure-
ment of the dijet cross section in photoproduction.4 The comparison of the
ratio of the transverse energy of the highest energy jet Et,max and the trans-
verse energy of the restc Et,rest for data and Monte Carlo simulations indicates
the quality of the hadronic calibration. This ratio is shown in Fig. 2 (a) as
a function of the highest energy jet. The ratio of Et,max/Et,rest in data and
simulations, which is shown in Fig. 2 (b), is consistent with uncertainties of the
hadronic energy scale below 2%.d Detailed studies5 demonstrate that at large
transverse momentum these scale uncertainties are independent of the angular
distribution and the mass of the jets as well as of diﬀerent data selections such
as direct, resolved or diﬀractive processes.

In order to illustrate the impact of these uncertainties on a cross section
measurement, the relative diﬀerence between the measured and the theoretical
cross sections6 is given in Fig. 3, as a function of xγ, the longitudinal momen-
tum fraction of the photon taken by the interacting parton. The correlated

errors due to the uncertainty in the calorimeter energy scales are shown as a
shaded band. Fig. 3 shows that the assumed scale uncertainties in the next-
to-leading order QCD calculation are the dominant source of uncertainties in
the comparison of data and theory.

for a lower Et,max and a higher Et,max region respectively. The inner error bars denote
the statistical error, the outer error bars denote all statistical and uncorrelated systematic
errors of the data added in quadrature. The correlated systematic errors are shown in the
middle plots as a shaded band. The bands in the lower plots show the renormalization and
factorization scale uncertainties of this NLO prediction.

3. Towards a New Energy Weighting Scheme

Because the H1 LAr calorimeter is non-compensating, a software weighting
method7 is applied for the energy reconstruction. In order to overcome some
deﬁcits in the low energy regime of the current energy weighting scheme a new
weighting procedure was studied using CERN test beam data.8

The reconstructed energy Ei

rec in a calorimeter cell i is derived from the

measured cell energy Ei

0 by
rec = ω ( Ei

Ei

0/Vol i, Egroup ) · Ei

0 .

(2)

0/Vol i
The weighting factor ω depends on the deposited energy density Ei
(V oli being the cell volume) which is diﬀerent for an electromagnetic and a
hadronic deposition, and on the total energy to be reconstructed (energy of
the group of selected clusters Egroup). The latter accounts for the fact that

5

both the relative diﬀerence between the energy response to electrons and to
pionse and the ﬂuctuation of the electromagnetic component in the hadronic
showerf depend on the energy.

The weighting factors ω are tabulated and derived wheelwise, separately for
the electromagnetic and the hadronic parts of the whole calorimeter, using a
more detailed simulation of single pions as standard for H1 physics analyses.9
Furthermore, noise corrections are applied. The method is valid from the
highest energies down to the noise level. For the ﬁnal calibration real DIS data
are used: the pt-balance is adjusted wheelwise to phad

t → 1.

t

Fig. 4 depicts the change in the pt-balance distribution if either the current
(a) or the new (b) energy weighting scheme is applied. In the current energy
weighting scheme there are too many entries for large phad
t values which
originate from neutral pions. In the new energy weighting scheme there are
fewer entries in the tails of this distribution. Furthermore, the shape is more
Gaussian-like and the resolution is somewhat improved.

t

The jet energy dependence of the pt-balance is also given in Fig. 4. In the
new energy weighting scheme an improvement of the hadronic energy response
at small jet energies can be observed (c) and the agreement between data and
Monte Carlo simulation is very good (d).

4. Conclusions

It has been discussed how physics data from electron proton scattering can
be used for the jet calibration of the LAr Calorimeter. In analyses of pho-
toproduction and NC DIS with high momentum transfer Q2, the calibration
uncertainties are of the order 2%.

A new software weighting scheme was discussed. First applications in DIS
with high Q2 show an improvement in the hadronic energy response at low
jet energies. Using this energy weighting scheme, the distribution of the pt-
balance between the hadronic system and the electron gets more Gaussian-like
compared to the current weighting.

Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the H1 Calorimeter and the Energy Scale Working Groups
for many discussions and the opportunity to present these results at this very
interesting conference. My thanks to the organizers.

eFor instance, at an energy of 10 GeV, the response to electrons is a factor 1.35 larger than
the response to pions.
f This is due to neutral pion production in nuclear reactions in the hadronic component of
the shower.

The circular photogalvanic eﬀect (CPGE) has been ob-
served in (100)-oriented p-GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells at
normal incidence of far-infrared radiation. It is shown that
monopolar optical spin orientation of free carriers causes an
electric current which reverses its direction upon changing
from left to right circularly polarized radiation. CPGE at nor-
mal incidence and the occurence of the linear photogalvanic
eﬀect indicate a reduced point symmetry of studied multi-
layered heterostructures. As proposed, CPGE can be utilized
to investigate separately spin polarization of electrons and
holes and the symmetry of quantum wells.

Spin polarization and spin relaxation in semicon-
ductors are the subject of intensive studies of spin-
polarized electron transport aimed at the development
of spinotronic devices like a spin transistor [1,2]. So far,
photo-induced spin polarization has been achieved by in-
terband optical absorption of circularly polarized light
with the photogeneration of spin-polarized electrons and
holes [3–5].

Here we report on the ﬁrst observation of the circular
photogalvanic eﬀect (CPGE) under intersubband transi-
tions in multiple-quantum-well (MQW) structures. Phe-
nomenologically, the eﬀect is a transfer of angular mo-
menta of circularly polarized photons into the directed
movement of free carriers, electrons or holes, and there-
fore depends on the symmetry of the medium. Micro-
scopically, it arises due to optical spin orientation of holes
in MQWs and asymmetric spin-dependent scattering of
spin-polarized carriers by interface imperfections followed
by an appearance of an electric current. The two states
of light circular polarization σ± result in diﬀerent spin
orientations and, thus, in electric photocurrents of oppo-
site directions. The CPGE has been observed on p-doped
(001)-oriented MQWs at normal incidence of the circu-
larly polarized far-infrared (FIR) laser pulses. In contrast
to the case of interband optical excitation, under inter-
subband transitions only one kind of carriers is involved
leading to a monopolar spin orientation. The observed
eﬀect can be utilized to investigate spin polarization of
extrinsic free carriers, and provides a simple method to
analyze the reduced point symmetry of the medium un-

der study, here MQWs.

The

experiments have been carried out on p-
GaAs/AlGaAs
(001)-MOCVD grown quantum well
(QW) structures with 400 undoped wells of 20 nm width
separated by 10 nm wide doped barriers. Diﬀerent sam-
ples of 5×5 mm2 size with hole densities in the QWs vary-
ing from 2 · 1011 cm−2 to 2 · 1012 cm−2 have been inves-
tigated. Ohmic contacts to the QWs were formed by
depositing Ti and Au with subsequent tempering. Two
pairs of point contacts along two perpendicular connect-
ing lines have been prepared, parallel to [1¯10] and [110]
(see inset Fig. 1). Two additional pairs of ohmic con-
tacts have been formed in the corners of the sample cor-
responding to the h100i crystallographic directions.

A high power pulsed far-infrared molecular laser
pumped by a TEA-CO2 laser has been used as a radiation
source delivering 100 ns pulses with the intensity I up to
1 MW/cm2. NH3 has been used as a FIR laser medium
yielding strong single-line linearly-polarized emissions at
wavelengths λ = 76 µm, 90 µm, and 148 µm [7,8]. The
photon energies of the laser lines correspond to transi-
tions between size-quantization subbands of GaAs QWs
[6]. The linearly-polarized laser light could be modiﬁed
to a circularly-polarized radiation by applying crystalline
quartz λ/4–plates.

While irradiating the (001) GaAs QWs by normally in-
cident circularly-polarized radiation (see inset in Fig. 1)
a fast photocurrent signal, U12, has been observed in un-
biased samples across one contact pair (contacts 1 & 2
in the inset). The signal follows the temporal structure
of the laser pulse intensity. The photocurrent changes
sign if the circular polarization is switched from σ+ to
σ−. Measurements of U12 as a function of the degree of
circular polarization Pcirc = sin 2ϕ, where ϕ is the angle
between the optical axis of the λ/4-plate and the plane
of polarization of the laser radiation, reveal that the pho-
togalvanic current j is proportional to Pcirc (Fig. 1). In
case of the linearly-polarized radiation corresponding to
ϕ = 0 or 90◦ the signal U12 vanishes. The magnitude
and the sign of the CPGE are practically unchanged with
variation of the angle of incidence in the range of -40◦ to
+40◦. Heating the sample from 4.2 K to 300 K leads to
a change of the sign of CPGE but the sin 2ϕ dependence
is retained. In bulk GaAs substrate material no CPGE
could be detected which gives evidence that the eﬀect

occurs in the MQWs.

where E is the complex amplitude of the electric ﬁeld of
the electromagnetic wave and

is periodic in ϕ with the period being one half of that
of U12. The value and the sign of U34 for σ+ are the
same like that for σ− (ϕ = ±45◦). The measurements
of the photogalvanic eﬀect along h100i crystallographic
directions show a sum of the projections on this direction
of the photocurrents induced along [1¯10] and [110].

The photogalvanic current under study can be de-
scribed by the following phenomenological expression [9]

jλ = χλµν (EµE ∗

µ)/2 + γλµ i(E × E∗)µ ,

E0 = |E|, q is the light wavevector. In a bulk crystal,
λ = x, y, z, while in a MQW structure grown along the
z direction, say z k [001], the index λ runs only over the
in-plane axes x k [100], y k [010] because the barriers pre-
vent carriers from moving along the z axis and, deﬁnitely,
jz = 0.

In bulk materials the photogalvanic eﬀects under con-
sideration arise in homogeneous samples under homoge-
neous excitation due to an asymmetry of the interaction
of free carriers with photons, phonons, static defects or
other carriers in noncentrosymmetric media [9]. The pho-
tocurrent given by the tensor χ describes the so-called
linear photogalvanic eﬀect (LPGE) because it is usually
observed under linearly polarized optical excitation. The
circular photogalvanic eﬀect (CPGE) described by the
pseudotensor γ can be observed only under circularly
polarized optical excitation.

In an ideal (001)-grown MQW structure with the D2d
point symmetry or in a MQW structure with nonequiv-
alent left and right interfaces yet retaining their local
symmetry C2v, a generation of the circular photocurrent
under normal incidence is forbidden because the pseu-
dovector component [E×E∗]z and the vector components
jx, jy transform according to nonequivalent irreducible
representations of the group D2d or C2v. Thus in order
to explain the experimental data the symmetry of the
structure should be reduced to the next possible point
group which is Cs and contains only two elements: the
identity transformation and one mirror reﬂection, say in
the plane (1¯10).
In this case we obtain under normal
incidence

Photogalvanic voltage signal U (dots - U12,

ferent contact pairs with orthogonal connecting lines (see in-
set) as a function of phase angle ϕ. The broken line and
the full line are ﬁtted after Eq.
3 as U12 ∝ sin 2ϕ and
U34 ∝ (χ+ + χ− cos2 2ϕ), respectively.

Using the other pair of contacts (contacts 3 & 4 in the
inset in Fig. 2) no photogalvanic signal dependent on the
sign of Pcirc could be detected. This is demonstrated
in Fig. 2 where the voltage U34 is plotted as a function
of the phase angle ϕ together with U12. The signal U34

where e is the polarization unit vector of the light and
γ, χ1, χ2 and χ3 are linearly independent coeﬃcients
which can depend on the light frequency and temper-
ature. Instead of x and y we use the axes x′ k [1¯10], y′ k
[110]. It follows then that the circular photocurrent is

by the light linearly polarized along x′ or y′ ﬂows in the
y′ direction. For the light initially polarized along x′ and

where χ± = (χ2 ± χ3)/2. The CPGE described by γ can
be related to an electric current in a system of free carri-
ers with nonequilibrium spin-polarization [10]. The pos-
sible microscopic mechanism is the spin-dependent scat-
tering of optically oriented holes by asymmetric interface
imperfections. The experimentally observed change of
sign of the photogalvanic current upon heating the sam-
ple from 4.2 K to room temperature may be caused by
the change of scattering mechanism from impurity scat-
tering to phonon assisted scattering. Note that, for ideal
zinc-blende-based MQW structures grown along the prin-
cipal axis [001], the CPGE is also possible but only under
oblique incidence of irradiation.

FIG. 3.

Photogalvanic voltage signal U34, in response
to linear polarized radiation, picked up across the contact
pair 3-4 and normalized by the intensity I as a function of
angle α between the electric ﬁeld vector and the connect-
ing line of contact pair 1-2 (see inset). Full line is ﬁtted to
U34 ∝ [χ+ − χ− cos 2(α + 90◦)] where the same parameters
χ+ and χ− have been used as for ﬁtting U34 in Fig. 2.

Comparison of Eq. (3) and Figs. 1,2 demonstrates a
good agreement between the theory and the experimental
data.
In order to verify independently the validity of
Eq. (2) for jy ′ we excited the sample by linearly-polarized
light and measured the voltage U34 as a function of the
angle α between the plane of linear polarization and the
axis x′. Note, that in this set-up α = 0 is equivalent
to ϕ = n 90◦ (n is integer 0, ±1...) in the set-up with
the λ/4 plate. Triangles in Fig. 3 present the measured
dependence U34(α), the solid curve is calculated after

U34 ∝ [χ+ − χ− cos 2(α + 90◦)] which follows from the
second line of equation (2). To obtain the curve in Fig. 3
the same parameters were used as for ﬁtting U34 in Fig. 2.
The low symmetry Cs required to have nonzero γ
and χi (i = 1, 2, 3) gives an evidence for the in-plane
anisotropy showing that in the investigated MQWs (i)
the [110] and [1¯10] crystallographic directions are diﬀer-
ent, and (ii) one of the reﬂection planes, (110) either
(1¯10), is removed as a symmetry element making the cor-
responding normal axis to be a polar one. The ﬁrst con-
clusion is valid for both the C2v and Cs point groups; the
diﬀerence between the [110] and [1¯10] axes has been stud-
ied by chemical etching [11] of GaAs (001) surfaces and
by an observation of the in-plane anisotropy of the quan-
tum Hall eﬀect [12] and anisotropic exchange splitting
of the excitonic levels (see [13] and references therein) in
periodic heterostructures. Moreover, (001) faces of GaAs
show trenches on the atomic level in one of the h110i
directions [14]. Obviously these trenches proceed into
MQWs forming interface islands, steps etc. and reduc-
ing their symmetry. The conclusion (ii) is less obvious.
It is worth to stress that, unlike conventional optical and
transport phenomena, the CPGE unambiguously chooses
between the C2v and Cs symmetries. At present we can
only guess why the available series of MQWs is charac-
terized by the reduced symmetry. Photogalvanic studies
of samples supplied from diﬀerent sources are needed to
come to a ﬁnal conclusion.

To summarize, it is shown that the optical orienta-
tion of free carriers can be accompanied by their drift.
Absorption of normally incident circularly-polarized FIR
radiation in gyrotropic media induces a photocurrent
which reverses the direction as the circular polarization
is changed from right- to left-hand orientation. These
observations reveal the reduced in-plane symmetry of
GaAs-based (001)-grown MQWs and can be used as a
simple method to detect and characterize asymmetries in
heterostructures. The method is eﬀective even at room
temperature. The theoretical considerations show that
the CPGE can be observed also in an ideal MQW of the
symmetry D2d if the incident radiation is obliquely inci-
dent. The experiments presented here have been carried
out in p-doped QWs but similar results are expected also
for n-QWs.

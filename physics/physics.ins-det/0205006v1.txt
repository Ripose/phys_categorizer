(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We measured images and Fourier images of ﬂuorescence for 0.11- and 0.22-µm-diameter dye-doped
polystyrene micro-sphere beads on a solid immersion lens, and experimentally veriﬁed strongly-
angle-dependent ﬂuorescence intensities due to eﬃcient near-ﬁeld optical coupling in solid immersion
ﬂuorescence microscopy. The results are interpreted in comparison with calculated emission patterns
of an emission dipole placed near a solid surface, which establish a basic model for high-collection
eﬃciency in solid-immersion ﬂuorescence microscopy.

A solid immersion lens (SIL) is an aberration-free
truncated-sphere-shaped solid lens with high refractive
index n used in proximity of a sample for high-resolution
near-ﬁeld optical microscopy [1]. Since 1990, various
applications of SILs to high-resolution optical read-out
have been reported, such as scanning optical microscopy
[1, 2, 3], optical storage [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and
spectroscopic imaging of semiconductor nano-structures
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] and dye molecules [18, 19, 20].
Recently, it is found in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy ex-
periments on semiconductors [11, 12] and dye molecules
[18] that the SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy has a signif-
icant advantage of high collection eﬃciency simultane-
ously with high resolution.

To interpret the high collection eﬃciency in SIL ﬂuo-
rescence microscopy [18], we made numerical calculation
of radiation patterns for an emission dipole located in the
near-ﬁeld regime of an air-SIL interface assuming a theo-
retical model by Hellen and Axelrod [21]. Calculated ra-
diation patterns show that ﬂuorescence is predominately
emitted in the direction of the SIL. We estimated col-
lection eﬃciencies on the basis of the emission patterns
under various experimental conditions, and gave an ex-
planation of the observed improvement of collection eﬃ-
ciency in the SIL microscopy.

However, quantitative experiments to prove the high
eﬃciency in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy are still few,
and the above model to estimate the eﬃciency seems to
require more experimental justiﬁcations. For this pur-
pose, eﬃciency measurements for various combinations of
SILs and samples with good accuracy are necessary. Fur-
thermore, direct observation of the radiation patterns of
ﬂuorescence in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy is essentially
important.

We verify, in this paper, the radiation patterns of ﬂu-
orescence by measuring angle-dependent ﬂuorescence in-
tensities via Fourier imaging as well as angle-integrated
ﬂuorescence intensities from both sides of the air-SIL in-
terface.
In the angle-integrated-intensity measurement
we made statistical analysis of data to accurately evalu-
ate the improvement in collection eﬃciency. These exper-

iments conﬁrm that the radiation patterns predicted by
the above dipole model are indeed realized, and that the
model well describes the eﬃcient near-ﬁeld optical cou-
pling in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy. The results justify
the estimation of absolute values of collection eﬃciency
in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy, and a value of 62% is
obtained in the present experiment.

The samples used in the experiment were dye-doped
polystyrene micro sphere beads (Molecular Probes, F-
8887) of 0.11 and 0.22 µm diameters with ﬂuorescence
peak at 600 nm. We attached the beads directly to ﬂat
surfaces of SILs by putting small drops of water solution
of the beads with about 10−7 concentration in volume
and letting water dried out. Though the bead samples are
not ideal for theoretical modeling, they are experimen-
tally easy to handle and stable in ﬂuorescence intensity
and in spatial position. The SILs used here were 2-mm-
diameter hemisphere SILs with refractive index n=1.845
(LaSF9-glass) and 1.687 (SF8-glass) prepared by polish-
ing sphere lenses into hemisphere shape (by Ogura Jewel
Industry Co., Ltd.).

We used a standard Nikon optical microscope (Nikon,
Optiphot-100s), equipped with an inﬁnite conjugate ob-
jective lens with NA=0.8, K¨ohler epi-illumination optics
for 546 nm line of 100W mercury lamp, a tube lens, and
a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Prince-
ton Instruments, TEA/CCD512TKM/1) for image de-
tection.

To perform ﬂuorescence microscopy with a SIL, we set
the SIL with beads on the microscope stage with its ﬂat
surface down, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (a), and
viewed the beads through the SIL. As a reference, we
performed conventional ﬂuorescence microscopy, by set-
ting the same SIL with beads with its ﬂat surface up, as
shown in the inset of Fig. 1 (b), using the SIL merely
as a glass substrate. In the rest of this paper, we denote
the measurement in the conﬁguration of the inset of Fig.
1 (a) shortly as the SIL microscopy or the measurement
via SIL, while that of Fig. 1 (b) as the conventional mi-
croscopy or the measurement via air.

of 0.11-µm-diameter beads in the same region obtained
via SIL (n=1.845) and via air, respectively, where we
found ﬂuorescence spots of four beads (a-d) in the same
arrangement. Spot sizes in Fig. 1 (a) are small, 0.34
µm on average, compared with those in (b), 0.46 µm,
which demonstrates improved spatial resolution in the
SIL microscopy. Figure 1 (a) and (b) are displayed in
their respective intensity scales, but actually the spots in
(a) were much brighter than those in (b).

The uniformity and strength of illumination should be
commented here. Since in the SIL microscopy we simply
added the SIL to the setup of the K¨ohler illumination mi-
croscope, illumination rays are refracted at the SIL’s sur-
faces. Figure 1 (c) shows the illumination density in the
SIL microscopy (n=1.845) in comparison with the orig-
inal K¨ohler illumination density, which is calculated on
the basis of ray tracing schematically shown in the inset.
The illumination density is very uniform, within 2% grad-
ual variation, in the region of 100-µm-radius around the
center, which completely covers the eﬀective ﬁeld of view
for the 2-mm-diameter SIL [22]. The excitation density
enhanced by a factor of 2.83 at the center corresponds to
a product of a convergence factor of n2=3.40 and trans-
mittance [4n/(1 + n)2]2 = 0.83 for normal incidence at
interfaces.

distribution of data on the x-axis is wide, where ¯x (mean
value) ± σx (standard deviation) of 1.0±0.38 is shown
by the horizontal bar. Similarly wide distribution is ob-
served on the y-axis, where ¯y ± σy of 22.4 × (1.0 ± 0.29) is
shown by the vertical bar. The wide distribution is most
likely caused by the size distribution of the beads, which
is ±30% in volume, or ±10% in diameter.

The data are well ﬁtted to a straight line y = ax, as
shown in Fig. 2. Two points far from the others, indi-
cated by open circles, were omitted in the least-square
ﬁtting procedure, because each of them might be unre-
solved two or more beads. Then, the value of a, which
represents the intensity ratio of the ﬂuorescence observed
in the SIL microscopy to the conventional one, is obtained
as 21.9 with the estimated error as small as 1.9. To eval-
uate the emission intensity ratio of ﬂuorescence for iden-
tical illumination density, we have to divide the ratio a
by the factor of n2[4n/(1 + n)2]2 = 2.83. The emission
intensity ratio of 7.7±0.7 is obtained from a = 21.9 ± 1.9.
Note that ¯y/¯x gives similar value of 22.4 for a with a
y/¯y2]1/2. While
large uncertainty of 48% as [σ2
the correlation plot and the least-square ﬁtting of Fig.
2 is useful to minimize the error of a, reasonably good
estimation of a is obtained simply by ¯y/¯x. This supports
the validity of our previous result for larger beads with
0.22 µm diameter, which was a = 13±3.6 obtained as
¯y/¯x [18]. The emission intensity ratio of 4.6±1.3 is ob-
tained after division by 2.83. Upper columns in Table 1
summarize these results for two kinds of beads.

0 < sin θ <NA=0.8 in the SIL side and the air side,
where θ is the polar angle of emission.

To verify angle-dependent emission patterns like Fig.
3 (a), we next measured Fourier images of emission
from the beads. In the measurement, we used the same
Nikon optical microscope as the above measurement, but
switched a tube lens to relay lenses and monitored ﬂuo-
rescence intensities on the back focal plane of the objec-
tive lens with a cooled CCD camera [23]. According to
the Abbe’s sine condition, the emission intensities in the
direction of the polar angle θ from the beads are shown in
the Fourier image intensities at the radius proportional
to sin θ.

Figure 3 (b) shows a Fourier image of a 0.22-µm-
diameter bead on a SIL (n = 1.687) obtained in the con-
ventional microscopy conﬁguration. The outline of the
bright circular region represents the aperture of the ob-
jective, which corresponds to sin θmax= 0.8 in this case.
The Fourier image is fairly uniform within the circle, in-
dicating that the emission depends little on the polar
angle θ via air, similarly to the pattern in (a).

Figure 3 (c) and (d) show Fourier images of a 0.22-
µm-diameter bead obtained in the SIL microscopy with
n=1.687 and 1.845, respectively. Each has a bright ring,
which corresponds to the emission peak at the critical
angle in the calculated pattern in (a). The ring diameter
in (d) is obviously smaller than in (c). This is consistent
with the diﬀerence of the calculated emission peak angle
between n=1.687 and 1.845 as shown in (a).

In order to examine the Fourier images, or the strong
angular-dependence in emission patterns, in the SIL mi-
croscopy in detail, we plotted in Fig.
4 their cross-
sectional proﬁles across their image centers, or sin θ de-
pendence of the emission intensity, for n=1.845 SIL. The
thick solid and dotted curves in Fig. 4 show the cross-
sectional proﬁles for the measured Fourier images of the
emission from 0.22- and 0.11-µm-diameter beads, respec-
tively, normalized at sin θ=0. Both curves go to zero for
sin θ > 0.8 limited by NA of the objective lens. Re-
markable diﬀerence between the two curves is observed
in the region of sin θ > 0.542 = 1/n, or θ beyond the
critical angle, since the light coupled via the evanescent
ﬁeld into the SIL is sensitive to the distance z between
the dipole and the SIL surface. The observed Fourier
images demonstrate that the near-ﬁeld optical coupling

plays essential role in high collection eﬃciency in the SIL
ﬂuorescence microscopy.

For reference to the experimental data, we calculated
emission patterns as functions of polar angle θ for ran-
domly oriented emission dipoles located at various dis-
tance z from the dielectric surface after Ref.
[21]. The
four thin solid curves in Fig. 4 are cross-sectional proﬁles
of Fourier images normalized at sin θ=0 calculated for
z=0, 0.02, 0.06, and 1.00 µm. While all the four curves
are similar for sin θ < 0.542 = 1/n, strong increase of
intensity in sin θ > 0.542 = 1/n occurs for smaller z.
It is found that the two experimental curves for 0.22-
and 0.11-µm-diameter beads are similar to the calculated
curves for z=0.06 and 0.02 µm, respectively.

The similarity between experimental data and calcu-
lation suggests that the fundamental process is modeled
properly, though it is not understood why small values of
z=0.06 and 0.02 µm gave the best ﬁt for 0.22- and 0.11-
µm-diameter beads, respectively, rather than the center-
of-mass distances of 0.11 and 0.055 µm form the SIL sur-
face. As a whole, however, the results of Fourier images
in Figs. 3 and 4 together with the result of Fig. 2 conﬁrm
strong angular dependence in near-ﬁeld optical coupling
for eﬃcient SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy.

In the end, we estimate absolute values of collection
eﬃciency in the present experiments. For 0< sin θ <0.8,
we indeed measured angular-dependent and angular-
integrated intensities of ﬂuorescence both in the air and
SIL directions for 0.22- and 0.11-µm-diameter beads. If
we extrapolate the angle-dependence data of two kinds
of beads with the calculated curves for dipoles at z=0.02
and 0.06µm to the 0.8< sin θ <1 region, we complete
emission patterns in all directions.

Then the estimated values of collection eﬃciency in the
SIL microscopy and in the conventional microscopy are
62% and 14% for 0.22-µm-diameter bead, whereas the
values are 62% and 8% for 0.11-µm-diameter bead. The
value of 62% for the SIL microscopy is obtained by con-
sidering reﬂection loss at the spherical surface of the SIL.
If we reduce the reﬂection loss by anti-reﬂection coating,
the collection eﬃciency should be raised to 68%. Re-
maining portions of 18% and 24% for 0.22- and 0.11-µm-
diameter beads are lost in directions of 0.8< sin θ <1.
These values, shortly summarized in lower columns of
Table 1, show the signiﬁcant advantage of the SIL in ob-
serving weak ﬂuorescence of small samples eﬃciently.

In summary, we observed strong angular dependence
in ﬂuorescence intensities in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy
via Fourier imaging for 0.11- and 0.22-µm-diameter dye-
doped polystyrene micro-sphere beads. The eﬃciency for
0.11µm diameter beads in SIL microscopy was 7.7±0.7
times higher than that measured in the conventional mi-
croscopy, and its absolute value was estimated to be 62%.

The results show that the eﬃcient near-ﬁeld optical cou-
pling in SIL ﬂuorescence microscopy are conﬁrmed ex-
perimentally and are approximately modeled as dipole
emissions near the SIL surface.

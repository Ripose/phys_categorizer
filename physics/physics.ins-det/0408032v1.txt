Abstract

We report on the study of a new liquid scintillator target for neutrino interactions in

the framework of the research and development program of the BOREXINO solar

neutrino experiment. The scintillator consists of 1,2–dimethyl–4–(1–phenylethyl)–

benzene (phenyl–o–xylylethane, PXE) as solvent and 1,4-diphenylbenzene (para-

Terphenyl, p-Tp) as primary and 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene (bis-MSB) as sec-

ondary solute. The density close to that of water and the high ﬂash point makes it

an attractive option for large scintillation detectors in general. The study focused

1 Introduction

Organic liquid scintillators are used in quantities of several hundreds of tons for

rare event detection in particle-astrophysics. The main objective in these ex-

periments is the real time spectroscopy of neutrinos from steady-state sources

such as the Sun, nuclear reactors and from beta decays in the crust and mantle

of the Earth, as well as from transient sources such as supernovae.

Despite the large target mass, the signal rates of the steady-state sources

are typically in the range of a few events per day down to a few events per

year at MeV or sub-MeV energies. Thus, background signal rates created by

radioactivity and cosmic ray interactions need to be extremely low.

Low backgrounds can be achieved by: (a) locating the detectors deep under-

ground to suppress the cosmic ray muon ﬂux, (b) shielding the scintillator

target against the ambient radioactivity from the surrounding rocks, and (c)

suppressing and removing radioactive impurities present in trace amounts in

the detector and ancillary systems as well as in the liquid scintillator itself.

This concept of background reduction has been pioneered by the BOREX-

INO collaboration [1] in the Counting Test Facility (CTF) [2,3,4] and is im-

plemented in the BOREXINO detector [1], and similarly, in the KamLAND

experiment [5].

This paper summarizes the study of 1,2–dimethyl–4–(1–phenylethyl)–benzene

(phenyl–o–xylylethane, PXE), a new scintillator solvent the key characteris-

tics of which are its high density (

1 g/cm3) and high ﬂash point (145oC).

∼

This scintillator solvent has been investigated as a ‘back-up solution’ for the

BOREXINO experiment. The design of choice is based on 1,2,4-trimethyl-

benzene (pseudocumene, PC), both as buﬀer liquid and as neutrino target.

Since the density of PXE is close to that of water, even large scintillator targets

can be submerged in water - serving as a shield against ambient radiation -

while creating only modest buoyancy forces on the scintillator containment

vessel. Moreover, a detector with water as shield and PXE as target material

provides a substantial higher ﬁducial target mass because of the improved

shielding performance against external radiation compared to a detector with

identical dimensions, but with both shield and target of organic liquids with

standard densities (

0.9 g/cm3). Finally, a PXE-water conﬁguration reduces

∼

the overall inventory of organic liquid in the detector systems, e.g. to about one

fourth in the case of BOREXINO. This, depending on national regulations,

may have an impact on the legal classiﬁcation of the detector systems and

6

therefore on the safety and operational aspects of the experiment. A further

asset of PXE is its high ﬂash point simplifying safety systems relevant for

transportation, handling and storage. According to regulations by the United

Nations (UN), PXE is legally non-hazardous for transportation purposes and

no special United Nation number code applies [6]. In a paper by Majewski

et al. [7] PXE has been described as a relatively safe solvent with very low

toxicity compared to standard liquid scintillators.

The study reported here of PXE as a solvent for a low-background scintilla-

tor for solar neutrino spectroscopy was carried out within the BOREXINO

project. Research on PXE scintillators started in 1995 with laboratory mea-

surements focusing on optical properties and radio puriﬁcation techniques with

solid columns. After completion of the laboratory scale study, about ﬁve tons

of PXE solvent for testing on prototype scale with the Counting Test Facil-

ity (CTF) of BOREXINO were acquired in 1996. Fluors were added on site

in hall C of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) and the ﬁnal

scintillator was puriﬁed with Module-0, a solid column puriﬁcation and liquid

handling system [8]. The CTF was loaded with PXE scintillator in October

1996 and ﬁrst data were acquired until January 1997. The quality of data was

limited because only a small fraction of the photomultipliers were operational.

The PXE scintillator was unloaded from the CTF after the shut down of the

detector in July 1997 and moved back into the storage tanks of Module-0. Fur-

ther batch puriﬁcation operations were carried out during the period October

until December 1997. Samples for neutron activation analysis were taken to

monitor the achieved radio purity after each operation. After reconstruction

of the CTF during 1999, the PXE scintillator was reloaded into the CTF and

measured from June to September 2000. The main objective during this pe-

7

riod was the analysis of radio purity and optical properties in a large volume

detector. Beyond this scope, physics limits on electron instability [9], nucleon

instability [10], neutrino magnetic properties [11], and on violations of the

Pauli exclusion principle [12] could be derived from measurements with the

PXE scintillator.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the physical and

chemical properties of the PXE solvent. Section 3 describes the optical prop-

erties of the solvent as well as the mixed scintillator. Section 4 is dedicated to

the large scale test of the PXE scintillator with the CTF including the scintil-

lator preparation, puriﬁcation and analysis of trace impurities, and conclusions

are given in Section 5.

2 Physical and chemical properties of PXE

PXE is a clear, colorless liquid with an aromatic odor. It is an industrial prod-

uct with diﬀerent applications, as for example: insulating oil in high voltage

transformers and capacitors and as oil for pressure sensitive paper. PXE is

produced by reacting styrene and xylene using an acidic catalyst. It is then

washed with water and distilled to improve the purity. Its ﬁnal industrial

puriﬁcation step uses a solid column.

PXE has the molecular formula C16H18 with a weight of 210.2 g/mol. Its

molecular structure is shown in Figure 1. Chemical and physical details which

are of relevance for detector design, safety and operational aspects are listed

in Table 1. The key features are its high density of 0.988 g/cm3, its low vapor

pressure and high ﬂash point of 145 oC. It is therefore classiﬁed as a non-

8

hazardous liquid.

For our test, the standard production scheme at Koch Chemical Company,

Corpus Christi, Texas, USA 2 was modiﬁed omitting the ﬁnal column puriﬁ-

cation at the company, since it was expected that the clay column material

might leach oﬀ radio active impurities, such as uranium and thorium. Instead

a column puriﬁcation system was built and operated using silica gel in the

underground laboratories of the LNGS. Details are discussed below.

3 Optical properties

The optical and scintillation properties of the pure PXE solvent, of selected

ﬂuors, and of PXE-ﬂuor mixtures have been investigated by UV/VIS spec-

trometry, by ﬂuorimetry and by excitation with ionizing radiation. The objec-

tive was to optimize the scintillator performance by maximizing its light yield

and attenuation length and minimizing its scintillation decay time. Methods

to remove optical impurities were studied, since they can potentially reduce

light yield and attenuation length. All optical properties presented in this

section are derived from laboratory size samples up to a few hundred ml’s.

Attenuation length measurements typically are done in ‘one-dimension’ only.

Scattered light, elastic or inelastic, is undetectable in these measurements

whereas in large volume applications with 4π geometry, the scattered photons

are not necessarily lost. The performance of the PXE scintillator in a large

volume detector, taking scattering into account, has been studied in CTF and

2 Koch Special Chemical Company stopped production of PXE in 2002. Nippon

Petrochemicals Co., Ltd., Japan, produces PXE as an equal mixture of ortho, para

and meta isomers

9

is discussed in Sec. 4.4.

3.1 Solvent properties

PXE diluted in cyclohexane shows an absorption maximum at 267 nm. The

emission spectrum after excitation at this wavelength peaks at about 290

nm as displayed in Figure 2. The ﬂuorescence lifetime after excitation at

λexc = 267 nm measured in diluted solutions of cyclohexane shows an ex-

ponential decay with a lifetime τ of

22 nsec. Preliminary samples obtained

∼
from Koch had various optical impurities with absorption bands around 300,

325, 360 and 380 nm. They could be observed both by UV/VIS and ﬂuorimet-

ric measurements. Passing the solvent through a column with acidic alumina

reduced the absorption peaks. The band at 380 nm was reduced most eﬃ-

ciently.

The PXE used for the 5 t test, as described Section 4, still had various optical

impurities, however at much reduced levels. The attenuation length at 430 nm

(Λ430), deﬁned as I(x) = I0 ·
attenuated intensity I(x) after the optical path length x, was Λ430 = 4.3 m

x/Λ430), with the initial intensity I0 and

exp(

−

in the pure PXE solvent. Attenuation lengths were measured with a Varian

Cary 400 UV/Vis photospectrometer in 10 cm cuvettes.

3.2 Scintillator properties

A tertiary scintillator system was chosen in order to shift the emission wave-

length to about 430 nm, well above the absorption bands of the residual opti-

cal impurities. This is achieved by using 1,4-diphenylbenzene (para-Terphenyl,

10

p-Tp) as primary solute and 1,4-bis(2-methylstyryl)benzene (bis-MSB) as sec-

ondary solute. Absorption and emission spectra of PXE in cyclohexane and

those of the ﬂuors in PXE are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The latter shows

that the emission spectrum of p-Tp is satisfactorily matched by the absorp-

tion spectrum of the wavelength shifter bis-MSB, and therefore an eﬃcient

energy transfer is expected in this solvent.

The scintillator properties were tested with p-Tp concentrations at 2 and

3 g/l (close to the solubility limit) and with bis-MSB at 20 mg/l. A scintilla-

tion yield for PXE of 88 (93) % with an addition of p-Tp (2.0 (3.0) g/l)/bis-

MSB(20 mg/l) with respect to a scintillator based on 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene

(PC) and 1.5 g/l of 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) has been found (uncorrected

for the PMT sensitivity). Attenuation lengths of Λ430 = 2.6 m to 3.2 m of the

scintillator mixture have been measured depending on the sample treatment

(cf. Section 4.2).

The ﬂuorescence decay time of the p-Tp(2.0 g/l)/bis-MSB(20 mg/l) scintilla-

tor mixture measured by ﬂuorimetry after excitation at 267 nm shows a fast

component τ of 3.7 nsec. At 3 g/l p-Tp, the decay constant is shortened to

3.2 nsec. The photon emission probability density function (pdf) was further

studied with ionizing radiation in order to investigate the contribution of long

lived triplet states and the possibility to use the emission time for discrimina-

tion of alpha versus beta particles (pulse shape discrimination). The response

to gamma radiation has been measured for a concentration of 2.0 g/l and

3.0 g/l p-Tp with a 137Cs source, and to alpha radiation at a concentration

of 3.0 g/l using a 210Po alpha source [16,17]. The pdf can be parametrized

by the weighted sum of four exponentials Pi (qi/τi) exp(

t/τi) with the pa-

−

rameters given in Table 2. In addition to an increased slow component which

11

can be used for pulse shape discrimination, alpha particles emit less light be-

cause of the high ionization density compared to electron or gamma radiation.

The quenching factor is mainly solvent dependent and has been measured for

diﬀerent alpha decays in the 238U chain, using 222Rn loaded scintillator. The

results are given in Table 3 [13].

Light attenuation of the standard mixture (PXE/(2.0 g/l)p-Tp/(20 mg/l)bis-

MSB) which has been used in the CTF (cf. Sec. 4) has been measured at

various steps during the preparation of the scintillator in 1996 and after ﬁlling

the CTF. After several puriﬁcation steps of the mixed scintillator through a

silica gel column in Module-0 in order to remove radio-impurities (cf. sections

below), attenuation lengths in the range between 2.6 and 3.0 m at 430 nm were

measured. After completion of the PXE measurements with CTF and subse-

quent batch puriﬁcation operations, the scintillator has been stored in barrels

under nitrogen atmosphere. In 2003, this scintillator was used in the frame

of the LENS project [14] and optical properties were remeasured to check for

degradation with time. The attenuation length as well as the light yield were

unchanged with respect to the measurements in 1996. Passing this scintilla-

tor mixture through a weak acidic alumina column increased the attenuation

lengths to 12 m as displayed in Figure 4 while retaining the scintillation yield

[15].

Facility

4 Large scale test of PXE with the BOREXINO Counting Test

The main objectives of the large scale test in the BOREXINO prototype de-

tector (Counting Test Facility, CTF [2]) were the study of 1) optical properties

12

on large scale, 2) achievable levels of radioactive trace contaminations of the

PXE based scintillator, 3) the performance of scintillator puriﬁcation with a

silica gel column, and 4) of the liquid handling system, Module-0. The purity

levels required for detection of low-energy solar neutrinos, in particular neu-

trinos from the 7Be electron capture, are at the µBq/m3 level corresponding

to concentration of 238U and 232Th of

10−16 g/g. For detailed speciﬁcations

∼
of solar neutrino rates and background requirements, the reader is referred

to Refs. [1,19]. As the 238U–progenies 222Rn, 210Pb, 210Bi and 210Po are not

necessarily in equilibrium with the progenitor activity, we studied the contam-

ination levels of 238U (as well as 232Th and several other isotopes) directly with

neutron activation analysis (NAA) at levels of 10−16g/g and below. The short

lived progenies are not accessible with NAA. Their contamination levels were

studied in the CTF together with other backgrounds, as for example the ra-

diogenic produced 14C. New techniques to remove radioactive isotopes by solid

column puriﬁcation were tested for the ﬁrst time in a ton scale experiment.

Furthermore, the preparation, handling and puriﬁcation of several tons of liq-

uid scintillator with Module-0 was the ﬁrst test of a subsystem of the liquid

handling system to be used in the scintillator operations in BOREXINO.

4.1 Scintillator preparation

About 6 tons of PXE solvent was procured from Koch Special Chemical Com-

pany, Texas, USA. To ensure a controlled procedure, the solvent was loaded by

us at the company site in three specially modiﬁed and cleaned stainless steel

transport containers and shipped to the Gran Sasso underground laboratories.

The PXE solvent was transferred from the transport containers into Module-0,

13

a liquid handling and puriﬁcation system, specially built for the PXE test. It

can be used for volumetric loading and unloading of liquid scintillator to/from

the CTF inner vessel, for ﬂuor mixing, puriﬁcation of liquid scintillator with

a silica gel column, Rn degassing of liquid scintillator by nitrogen sparging,

and spray degassing as well as for water extraction.

Module-0 consists of a high and low pressure manifold system which are con-

nected by pumps to build up the pressure diﬀerence of typically 2 atm. The

manifolds are connected to tanks, columns, ﬁlters etc. to allow a variety of ﬂow

paths and operations. The system includes two 7 m3 electropolished pressure

tanks (EP1/2), two 1 m3 process tanks (BT1/2) equipped with nitrogen sparg-

ers at the bottom and spray nozzles at the top (for a turbulent injection of

liquid together with nitrogen gas), pumps, ﬂow meters, Millipore ﬁlters (0.5,

0.1 and 0.05 micron) and one 70 l high pressure column puriﬁcation unit. All

tanks are connected to a high purity nitrogen gas system to provide a nitro-

gen blanket at typically 30 mbar overpressure. The complete system has been

designed according to ultra-high-vacuum standards to avoid contaminations

from the environmental air, in particular of 222Rn and 85Kr. Only stainless

steel and Teﬂon are in contact with the liquids. Metal surfaces are electro pol-

ished and welds carried out with thorium free welding rods. Module-0 has been

constructed in a class 1000 clean room. After completion all surfaces exposed

to scintillator were cleaned by us following a detailed procedure to remove sur-

face contaminations as radon progenies 210Pb, 210Bi and 210Po. Details about

the up-graded system are given in [8].

The ﬂuors (p-Terphenyl and bis-MSB, both from Sigma-Aldrich Co., scintil-

lation grade) were sieved and then added without further puriﬁcation to EP1

through a glove box connected to the top inlet ﬂange which was ﬂushed with

14

nitrogen while the PXE solvent was agitated with a nitrogen ﬂux from the

bottom inlet to facilitate dissolving p-Tp. To accelerate the solvation of p-Tp,

the EP1 tank was heated to 38 oC for four days under continuous nitrogen

agitation. The ﬁnal scintillator mixture had a concentration of 2.0 g/l p-Tp

and 20 mg/l bis-MSB.

4.2 Puriﬁcation with silica gel

One objective of the CTF test was to study the performance of scintillator

puriﬁcation with a solid silica gel column. Preceding laboratory tests of the

column puriﬁcation with PXE/TP with and without the addition of radio

tracer showed a clear reduction of metal impurities [20]. The scintillator com-

ponents had been mixed as received from the supplier; no special pretreatment

had been given to the ﬂuor and the wavelength shifter. The ready mixed PXE

scintillator was then passed through a column ﬁlled with silica gel (Merck,

Silica Gel 60, 25-70 mesh ASTM) at a ﬂow rate of typically 100 l/hour. The

silica gel used during these operations has been radio assayed with HP germa-

nium spectrometry and by direct measurements of the emanated radon with

proportional counters. The results are listed in Table 4. Despite the high bulk

impurities of the Merck silica gel, we did not observe any measurable carry

over into the scintillator apart from 222Rn. For use in Borexino we have

found silica gel material with improved radio purity, in particular the radon

emanation rate is 0.13

0.07 mBq/kg.

±

During the CTF test, we passed the PXE scintillator through a column with

a ﬂow rate of typically 100 l/hour from one EP tank into the other. Radon

is removed by purging the scintillator after passing the column as displayed

15

schematically in Figure 6.

A variety of samples (B-H) have been taken for tracing the puriﬁcation process

during the operations which are referred to in the following section:

Sample (B) was taken from the transport tank at Gran Sasso prior to un-

loading and mixing with p-Tp and bis-MSB.

Sample (C) was collected from Module-0 after addition of p-Tp and bis-MSB

and prior to passing the scintillator through a silica gel column.

Sample (D) was sampled during ﬁlling the inner vessel (IV) at the top-inlet

of the IV. The complete scintillator had passed once a column of about 80 cm

height (15 kg) which had been exchanged against fresh silica gel after the ﬁrst

two tons had run through the column, and once with a height of about 50 cm,

i.e. in total two times.

Sample (E) was collected at the top-inlet of the IV (as in (D)). The scintilla-

tor had been circulated from the IV through the column (re-ﬁlled to a height

of 80 cm) and back into the IV. The ﬂow rate was adjusted such that one

cycle (5000 l) took two days. The scintillator was circulated for four days, i.e.

two cycles.

i.e. ﬁve cycles.

Sample (F) was sampled after circulating the scintillator from the IV through

a 0.05 micro-m Teﬂon ﬁlter back into the IV. The scintillator was not passing

through a column. The operation lasted ﬁve days with a ﬂow of 5000 l/day,

Sample (G) was taken after the scintillator was unloaded from the IV into

the EP1-tank from Module-0 after completion of a water extraction in the

16

EP1 tank.

Sample (H) was collected in Module-0 after circulating the scintillator from

EP1 through the column back to EP1. The column packing had not been

exchanged (same as in (E)). This ﬁnal operation lasted for eight days with a

ﬂow rate of 3600 l/day, i.e. about 6 cycles.

4.3 Radio assay with neutron activation analysis

Combining neutron activation and low level counting methods, we developed a

novel analytical method with sensitivities of 10−16g/g and below for 238U and

232Th in liquid scintillators. For this purpose about 250 g samples of liquid

scintillator were irradiated at a neutron ﬂux of (1012

1013) s−1cm−2 up to

−

100 hours at the research reactor in Garching. The long lived primordial radio

nuclides are transformed into short-lived radio nuclides (e.g. 238U

239 Np,

→

232Th

233Pa), thus providing a higher speciﬁc activity with respect to their

→

progenitors. After irradiation, liquid-liquid and ion exchange techniques were

applied to separate the radio nuclides of interest from interfering activities.

Coincidence counting methods [22], e.g. β-γ-conversion electron for 239Np

and β-γ for 233Pa, further increase the sensitivity. Details can be found in

Refs. [23,24,25].

Samples for neutron activation analysis were taken before and after all major

scintillator preparation and puriﬁcation operations (cf. Sec. 4.2). The main

results of the neutron activation analysis are summarized in Tables 5 and 6.

In addition to 238U and 232Th concentrations, we report the concentrations of

non-radioactive metal isotopes and their reduction after puriﬁcation, in order

17

to illustrate the performance of the silica gel column [26]. New purity records

in organic liquid scintillators have been achieved for uranium at c(238U) <

1

·

10−17g/g, and for thorium at c(232Th) < 1.8

10−16g/g, thus meeting the

·

requirements for BOREXINO not only for 238U and 232Th, but as well for

most of the other long lived radio nuclides.

4.4 Measurements of PXE scintillator in the CTF

The BOREXINO prototype detector CTF is a highly sensitive instrument for

the study of backgrounds in liquid scintillators at energies between a few tens

of KeV and approximately 4 MeV. It consists of a transparent nylon balloon

with 2 m diameter containing 4.2 m3 of liquid scintillator. 100 PMTs with

light concentrators mounted on a 7 m diameter support structure detect the

scintillation signals (optical coverage 20 %). The whole system is placed inside

a cylindrical steel tank (11 m in diameter, 10 m height) that contains 1000 tons

of ultra-pure water in order to shield against external γ rays from the PMTs

and other construction material as well as neutrons from the surrounding rock.

In the upgraded version of the CTF detector (after 1999), 16 additional PMTs

mounted on the ﬂoor of the water tank detect the Cherenkov light created by

muons transversing the water buﬀer and are used as a muon veto. Details

of the CTF detector and results of ﬁrst measurements with pseudocumene

scintillator are given in Refs. [2,4].

4.4.1 Sequence of measurements

Direct counting after ﬁrst loading of the PXE scintillator into the CTF in

1997 did not provide conclusive results because of photo-tube and electronics

18

problems of the detector system that hindred data evaluation. The scintillator

was subsequently unloaded into the EP-1 tank. Both the CTF detector and

the liquid handling system Module-0 were upgraded during 1999 and 2000.

Prior to reﬁlling the CTF in summer 2000, the scintillator was passed once

again through a 40 l silica gel column. The CTF PXE campaign can be divided

into four distinct phases:

(1) Water run: ﬁrst data were taken during May 2000 with both the inner

vessel and the external tank ﬁlled with water. These data were used to

test and tune the electronics and to determine criteria to identify muon

events.

(2) Scintillator ﬁlling: loading of the scintillator into the Inner Vessel was

done in four batches of 1 ton each separated by short periods of data

taking. Filling operations lasted from June 3 until July 15, 2000.

(3) Data taking: data were taken from July 16 until September 5, 2000, cor-

responding to 52 days with 4.2 tons of PXE. The Inner Vessel was valved

oﬀ and no operations were performed during this period.

(4) Calibration: after completion of the data taking period, a series of cali-

bration measurements with a 222Rn point source were carried out. The

source was moved inside the inner vessel to map the detector response

and tune the position reconstruction software.

4.4.2 Detector performances

The pulse height - energy relation can be derived from the 214Po alpha peak

(cf. Figure 7 ) together with the measured quenching factors as given in Ta-

ble 3. Due to its short half life of 164 µs, the 214Po decay can easily be tagged.

19

The 214Po stems mainly from 222Rn introduced during scintillator loading and

therefore is homogeneously distributed in the scintillator volume. The alpha

particle has an energy of 7.69 MeV which in the scintillator is quenched to an

equivalent beta energy of (950

12) keV according to our laboratory mea-

±
surements. In the CTF, the peak position corresponds to (304

3) photo

±

electrons leading to a yield of (320

8) photo electrons per MeV. The pulse

±

height – energy relation is also a parameter of the 14C ﬁt (see below), which is

done in the energy range from 70 to 150 keV, resulting in a somewhat higher

value of 340 photo electrons per MeV. Here, no ionization quenching is taken

into account. A more detailed analysis of the photo electron yield including a

model with ionization quenching, has been presented in Ref. [11]. A value of

372

8 photo electrons per MeV has been derived for the asymptotic yield,

ie. for scintillation light created by electrons with energies large compared to

±

their rest mass.

The energy resolution can be derived from the width of the 214Po alpha peak

and corresponds to σ(E)/E

8.7 %, or σ(E)/√E

2.6 keV1/2. A value

≃

≃

of σ(E)/√E

2.5 keV1/2 is obtained from the spectral analysis of the 14C

≃

spectrum at energies between 70 and 150 keV.

The spatial resolution was studied with a localized 222Rn source at various

positions inside the Inner Vessel [27]. Values of σx,y ≃
600 keV were obtained at the detector’s center (cf. Figure 8 ). The resolution

12 cm, σz ≃

13 cm at

degraded up to 15 % close to the surface of the Inner Vessel.

The photon arrival time distribution was studied with the source located at the

center of the detector. Figure 9 displays the time distribution for scintillation

photons from the 214Bi beta decay. The data are compared with a Monte

20

Carlo simulation which includes the scintillation decay time from laboratory

measurements given in Table 2, elastic and inelastic scattering and the PMT

time jitter. Monte Carlo and data show good agreement for arrival times up

to 25 ns. The data show a larger slow component than the MC simulation,

which could be due to reﬂected photons and/or PMT late pulses which are

not fully accounted for in the simulation.

To distinguish alpha from beta particles by pulse shape discrimination, the

analog sum of the charge signal from all PMTs is split into three identical

signals and fed into a charge sensitive ADC with diﬀerent time delays. The

total charge is derived from integration over the entire charge signal 0 - 500 ns,

while the slow component is derived from the time windows 32 - 532 ns and 48

- 548 ns respectively. The tail-to-total ratio r32/tot or r48/tot can then be used

as discrimination parameter [28] as displayed in Figure 10. The discrimination

eﬃciency can be derived from a clean data sample of α and β/γ events in the

corresponding energy range. Only the 214Bi(β)-214Po(α) decay sequence can

unambiguously be identiﬁed as pure α or β/γ events due to the short half life

of 214Po. Only 214Bi events in the same energy range as the 214Po events (0.6

- 1.3 MeV) were considered. Fixing the β acceptance eﬃciency at 98 % leads

to an α identiﬁcation eﬃciency of 84.6 %; applying a radial cut on the 214Bi

and 214Po events of r < 90 cm leads to an increased α identiﬁcation eﬃciency

of 92.4 %. This improvement is due to the fact that for events in the outer

regions of the Inner Vessel the diﬀerence in the light path to diﬀerent PMTs

is higher, and therefore the fraction of light registered at late times is higher.

Also other methods for α/β discrimination have been studied with the CTF

[29,30], and will be implemented in Borexino.

21

4.4.3 14C analysis

The counting rate below 200 keV is dominated by the 14C beta decay with an

endpoint of 156 keV. The 14C concentration in the scintillator was determined

by ﬁtting a convolution of the theoretical beta spectrum and the energy de-

pendent detector resolution function, plus a background contribution to the

measured spectrum in the energy range from 70 to 150 keV [3,31]. The low en-

ergy spectrum together with the ﬁt is displayed in Figure 11. At lower energies

there is a background contribution from Cherenkov events produced by γ’s in

the shielding water. From the ﬁt we derive the 14C activity which translates

to a ratio of 14C/12C = (9.1

0.3(stat)

0.3(syst))

10−18. The systematic

±

±

×

error is dominated by the uncertainty of the scintillator mass.

4.4.4 238U decay chain

The 238U decay chain is assayed via the delayed coincidence of the 222Rn

progenies 214Bi (β/γ) and 214Po (α) with a half life of 164 µs. Assuming secular

equilibrium of the decay chain - not expected to be the case here - the measured

214Bi – 214Po rate can be expressed as uranium-equivalent activity. (One 214Bi

– 214Po decay per day and ton corresponds to an uranium concentration of

c(238U)

9.4

10−16 g/g.) We found an upper limit of c(238U) = (2.3

≃

·

0.4)

·

±

10−15 g/g. The details of the uranium determination are as follows.

After loading the CTF we observed an initial 214Bi – 214Po decay rate of about

90 counts per day which was related to 222Rn as it decayed away with a half life

of 3.825 days. The last two 1-week-periods of data taking with a total counting

time of 7.32 days (period I) and 6.98 days (period II) were used for the 238U

and 232Th analysis. The contribution from the initial 222Rn contamination was

22

then less than 1 count per day. The detector eﬃciency (due to the dead time

connected with the read out of each event) was 91 % during that period. Two

cuts served to reject events originating from cosmic ray muons: the muon veto

must not have triggered, and the meantime of all hit PMTs must be below

25 ns. With these two cuts, muon events can be discriminated with a high

eﬃciency while scintillation events are not aﬀected (acceptance >99 %). The

214Bi-214Po events were selected by applying the following cuts: energy of the

ﬁrst event > 300 keV (eﬃciency 95 %); energy of the following event between

0.6 and 1.25 MeV (99 %); coincidence time between 5 µs and 800 µs (94%).

224 (199) candidate events survived the cuts for period I (II), corresponding

to a 222Rn activity of 102 µBq/m3 (99 µBq/m3). This activity however was

not homogeneously distributed within the scintillator volume, but most of the

events were localized along the vertical symmetry axis of the detector. An

artefact due to false reconstruction could be excluded after the insertion of a

point like source which was located both on and oﬀ axis. The origin of these

localized events could not be identiﬁed, however it can be excluded that they

are related to the intrinsic scintillator impurities. To derive a number for the

residual 222Rn concentration homogeneously distributed in the scintillator, we

applied a cylindrical cut around the vertical axis. For Rx,y > 0.6 m we observed

a 222Rn activity of A(222Rn) = (27

5)µBq/m3 in period I and A(222Rn) =

±

(23

5)µBq/m3 in period II, which gives an upper limit for the intrinsic 238U

±

contamination of the scintillator of c(238U) = (2.3

0.4)

10−15 g/g

(I) and

±

·

c(238U) = (1.9

0.4)

10−15 g/g

(II) .

±

·

Further radio-isotopes from the uranium decay chain of concern are the 210Pb

progenies 210Bi and 210Po. Secular equilibrium typically is disturbed even

within this sub-chain, as well as with respect to the progenitor 226Ra because

23

of the characteristic lifetimes and the diﬀerent chemistries involved. About

100 to 200 decays per day with alpha-like pulse shapes and with energy depo-

sitions quenched to approximately 0.5 MeV are attributed to 210Po decays in

the scintillator [32].

4.4.5 232Th decay chain

A limit for the intrinsic 232Th contamination can be derived in a similar way

as for 238U, as in the 232Th chain there is also a delayed β-α coincidence,

212Bi-212Po, however with a half life of 299 ns. It can be distinguished from the

214Bi-214Po coincidence by the higher energy of the α decay and the shorter

coincidence time, though the latter has to be considered as a background.

Secular equilibrium in the 232Th chain is usually observed for 228Th and its

progenies. It can be broken between 232Th and 228Th. Assuming full secular

equilibrium and including the branching ratio of 212Bi(β)-212Po(α) of 64 %, an

activity of one 212Bi decay/(day

ton) corresponds to a 232Th contamination of

·

the scintillator of 4.4

10−15 g/g. We found c(232Th) < 1.7

10−15g/g (90 % C.L.).

·

·

The details of the thorium limits are detailed below.

The following cuts were applied to select the 212Bi-212Po events: energy of

the ﬁrst event: more than 300 keV (eﬃciency 85 %); energy of the second

event: more than 1.1 MeV (50 %); coincidence time between 50 and 3000 ns

(89 %). The cut on the energy of the group 2 event was chosen so high in

order to minimize the background from 214Po. The overall eﬃciency of the

cuts for the selection of the 212Bi-212Po events is 38 %. In both periods ana-

lyzed, 1 candidate event survived the cuts, corresponding to a 228Th activity of

1.5 µBq/m3(I) / 1.6 µBq/m3(II), or a 232Th equivalent of c(232Th) = (3.9

·

II. The systematic error is dominated by the 214Po background and the detec-

tor dead time. As the concentration is, within the errors, compatible with zero,

it can be converted into an upper limit of c(232Th) < 1.7

10−15g/g (90 % C.L.) .

·

4.4.6 Residual backgrounds

An estimation of the remaining background for the neutrino detection in

Borexino is provided by the subtraction of all known contributions from the

background spectrum measured in the CTF. In order to reduce the contribu-

tion from the external background, a radial cut (r < 0.9 m) has been applied.

Also, all correlated events have been tagged and discriminated. In the neutrino

window (NW, 250 keV < E < 800 keV), the counting rate then is 120 events

per day and ton. As next step, all muon induced events have been subtracted

(74 events per day and ton). In this inner region of the detector, alphas can

be discriminated via their pulse shape with an eﬃciency of

90 %, leading

∼

to 48 events per day and ton. The resulting background spectrum is shown in

Figure 12. Clearly visible are the contributions from 14C the remaining alphas

from the 238U and 232Th chain, and a 40K γ peak, which could be identiﬁed as

external background originating from the Vectran strings that hold the Inner

Vessel in place.A dedicated measurement of the strings showed a concentration

of 45 ppm K.

The large scale test of PXE in the CTF showed that the purity levels required

for the detection of low energy solar neutrinos can be achieved by puriﬁcation

of the scintillator with a silica gel column. Very low 238U concentrations were

measured in PXE by NAA (< 1

10−17 g/g). A 222Rn background of the or-

·

25

der of several 10−15 g/g uranium equivalent from an unidentiﬁed source was

present, thus preventing any determination of the concentrations of 226Ra, or

its equivalent 238U amount assuming secular equilibrium. The 232Th concen-

tration measured in the CTF ((4.0

4.0

0.4)

10−16 g/g) is compatible with

±

±

·

the NAA limit of < 2

10−16 g/g.

·

5 Outlook

PXE based scintillator has been investigated for application in BOREXINO

as detector medium for low energy solar neutrino spectroscopy. Key questions

under study were the optical properties, radio purities and new techniques of

puriﬁcation by solid column extraction. Both laboratory measurements and

the large scale operations in the CTF showed that PXE scintillator as target

and water as buﬀer medium is a viable solution for BOREXINO and rated

as a backup solution. The default conﬁguration in the BOREXINO design is

based on pseudocumene as scintillator as well as buﬀer medium. Because of

its superior safety characteristics, future applications of PXE in underground

experiments are conceivable, as for example the search for non-vanishing value

of Θ13 with reactor neutrinos, the search for neutrinoless double beta decay

with metal loaded scintillators, the study of neutrinos from the interior of

the earth and from Supernovae, as well as the study of proton decay via the

K-meson decay channel.

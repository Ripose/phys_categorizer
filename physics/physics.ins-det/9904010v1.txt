Abstract

The application of reach-through avalanche photodiodes (R’APD) as a photodetec-
tor for scintillator tiles has been investigated. The light collected by WLS ﬁbers
(0.84mm and 1mm diameter) embedded in the scintillator has been transmited to
the 0.5mm2 active surface of APD by clear optical ﬁbers and optical connectors. A
low noise charge sensitive preampliﬁer (≈ 400e− equivalent noise charge) has been
used to gain the photodiode signal. Various conﬁgurations of tile-ﬁbre systems, suit-
able for CMS and LHCb experiments at LHC have been studied using cosmic muons
and muon beam at SPS at CERN. In order to optimize the performance of APD,
measurments in the temperature range from −10oC to +25oC have been done. The
M IP detection eﬃciency and e−/M IP separation have been estimated in order to
determine applicability of the readout for LHCb preshower.

Key words: APD; WLS; ﬁbre; scintilattor; calorimetry.

1 Introduction

Recently intensive R&D on scintilator tile-ﬁber readouts is being carried out
in order to satisfy the needs of calorimeters in new LHC experiments [1], [2].
The speciﬁc requirements for these types of detectors are:

• Operation in magnetic ﬁeld up to 4T esla.

Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint

2 February 2008

• Large linear dynamic range - 105 for the detector-preampliﬁer couple.
• Long lifetime of the photodetectors - 5 to 10 years of operation at high

luminosity.

• Radiation hardness - up to 2Mrad integrated dose.
• Small size - because of very large number of channels in use.
• Suﬃcient Signal/Noise ratio - to measure the signal from a minimum ion-

ising particle (MIP ).

• Capability of measuring the signal generated by a radioactive source as a

DC current to a precision of 1%.

• Reasonable price.

Two main types of photodetectors satisfy the above requirements: hybrid
photodiodes (HPD) and avalanche photodiodes (APD). The advantages of
avalanche photodiodes over the other types of photodetectors are:

• Insensitivity to magnetic ﬁeld.
• Linear dynamic range of 106.
• Fast response (< 1ns).
• High quantum eﬃciency in the range from 200nm to 1100nm.
• Small size (10 × 10 × 5mm3).
• Low price of APD and preampliﬁer.

Possible disadvantages of the photodiodes are low internal gain (50 − 300)
compared to the PMT and HPD one and relativelly high excess noise factor.
The present paper is devoted to the investigation of the applicability of APD’s
as a readout for scintilator tile-ﬁber systems. The choice of the scintilator tiles
design has been determined by the requirements for two of the LHC exper-
iments under preparation - CMS and LHCb. The main goal of our research
was to achieve Signal/Noise ratio enough to measure the MIP signal from
scintilator tile-ﬁber and good e−/MIP separation needed for the preshower
detector of the LHCb experiment. For this purpose, various designs of the
scintilator tile-ﬁber system have been developed (section 2). The APD char-
acteristics, electronics and calibration of the systems under investigation are
presented in sections 3, 4 and 5 correspondently. The results from measure-
ments performed with cosmic muons and muon beams at SPS accelerator are
reported in section 6.
It is shown that cooling of the photodiodes reduces dark current and increases
gain hence allowing us to achieve by times higher Signal/Noise ratio and to
reach our goals.

2 Scintillator tile - ﬁbre system

Two diﬀerent designs of scintillator tile - ﬁbre system have been studied (ﬁg.1).
The ﬁrst one is proposed for CMS HCAL [3] while the second one is under
investigation for the preshower detector in LHCb experiment [4]. Three dif-
ferent types of WLS ﬁbers - green Kuraray Y11 /0.84mm diameter/, green
Bicron 91A /1mm/ and red Bicron 99-172 /1mm/ have been used. In order to
estimate the scintilators light output, cosmic muons measurments using PMT
FEU85 have been performed. The WLS ﬁbers were directly coupled to the
PMT window. The signal from PMT was read out by charge-sensitive ADC
LeCroy 2249W with 250f C/channel sensitivity using a 160ns gate triggered
by two scintillator counters. Calibration of PMT was done by ﬁtting the single
photoelectron distribution, produced by 15ns light pulses of blue LED [5]. The
average number of photoelectrons induced by cosmic muons are presented in
Table 1. Taking into account the PMT photocathode quantum eﬃciency at

500nm emission peak of green WLS ﬁbers (≈ 6%) [6] one can estimate ≈ 180
photons from 4 × 4 × 1cm3 scintillator with 8 coils of ﬁber. Coupling of WLS
ﬁber to a clear ﬁber with the help of optical connector leads to the reduction
of the light output at the level of 20% − 35%. In order to improve the light
collection we have matted the scintillator surface on which the WLS ﬁbers
were placed. This gaves a 20% increase of the light yield.

3 Avalanche Photodiodes

The avalanche photodiodes under investigation are manufactured by ”InterQ”
Ltd. using planar technology on a p−type high resistivity silicon with a resis-
tivity of 2kΩcm [7],[8]. They are n+ − p − π − p+ type (R’APD).The multi-
plication region of the diodes is produced by ion implantation and two-stage
diﬀusion of boron and phosphorus (ﬁg.2). The active surface of the detectors
is 0.5mm2. Some characteristics of the diodes are presented in Table 2.

4 Electronics

The schematic view of the specialy designed for our investigation electronics is
presented on ﬁg.3. The chain consists of a charge-sensitive preampliﬁer, CR-
RC shaper and current feedback ampliﬁer, which can drive a back terminated
50Ω line. A JFET SST309 transistor with high forward transconductance (de-
termined by the very short shaping time - 25 ns) about 15 mS per 10 mA drain
current and a relatively low input capacity - 6 pF has been used. The noises
of the shaping ampliﬁer become signiﬁcant (the noise bandwidth is 10 MHz)
due to the short shaping time. For this reason, a microwave bipolar transistors
with low RBB′ have been used. The thermostability of the preampliﬁer was
achivied via negative feedback.
Main parameters of the preampliﬁer are:

• Equivalent charge noise ≈ 400e− at 1pF detector capacity (ﬁg.4).
• Sensitivity of the preampliﬁer is 160mV /106e−. (This coeﬃcient depends on

value of capacitor C1).

• 25ns shaping time.
• Full width of output signal ≈ 150ns.
• Maximum output voltage about 3.5V .

5 Calibration of the readout

The calibration of the readout has been done using 15ns long blue light pulses
emited by LED. The light has been splited up between APD and PMT read-
outs throught a special optical connector. The signals from both readouts
have been registrated by qADC with 160ns gate. The measurements have
been done at diﬀerent light intensities, reverse bias voltages and temperatures
. The summary results are presented below:

• The normalized internal gain of APD as a function of applied bias voltage
is shown on ﬁg.5. The gain at 60V and 22oC is about 6. Cooling of the
photodiodes leeds to breakbown voltage decrease and to a valuable gain

4

increase mainly at voltages near to the breakdown.

• The APD and preampliﬁer noise in terms of ADC channels vs. applied bias
voltage is ploted on ﬁg.6. At low temperatures the noise remains low up to
particular voltage near to the breakdown and then increases drastically. On
the other hand at high temperatures, noise is higher and increases smoothly.
The equivalent noise charge can be estimated taking into account that the
preampliﬁer gain is 68e− per ADC channel. The small increase of noise at
low bias voltages is due to larger capacity of photodiodes which is a result
of the absence of full depletion of charges in APD at these voltages.

• Fig.7 shows the Signal/Noise ratio as a function of the bias voltage. The
cooling of APD allow us to increase drastically the Signal/Noise ratio. The
maximum of this ratio can be achivied at bias voltages near the breakdown
where the signal is already large while the noise is still low. Further increase
of the voltage results in abrupt increase of the noise.

It’s clear that even for low intensity ligth sources, cooled APD gives a consid-
erable S/N ratio. The large increase of the gain of APD at low temperatures
is a result from fact that the multiplication process in the APD is aﬀected
by the temperature. This happens since electrons lose energy to the phonons,
whose energy density increases with the temperature, and at lower tempera-
tures it takes shorter for the electrons to reach the energy required for impact
ionization.

6 Measurments with muons

We have performed series of measurments of the scintilator tile-ﬁber readout
using cosmic muon ﬂux and muon beam at SPS at CERN. The tests have been
made with PMT and APD readouts in a wide temperature range. We have
obtained 1.5 − 2 times higher eﬃciency of Bicron 99-172 ﬁber over Bicron 91A
ﬁber and 1.25−1.5 times over Kuraray Y11 ﬁber with APD readout because of
the higher photodiode quantum eﬃciency at longer wavelengths of incoming
light. The results obtained with Bicron 99-172 ﬁber are presented on ﬁg.8
and ﬁg.9. Due to the long right-handed tail in the muon signal distribution,
in what follows the S/N ratio is deﬁned as a ratio of the signal distribution
maximum MP V (Most Probable Value) [9] to the σ of pedestal. The tail is
determined by a low light yield from the scintillator and by the so called excess
noise factor (F) of the photodiodes. Taking into account that F rises linearly
with the bias voltage applied, we have to ﬁnd the operational voltage at which
the S/N ratio is enough good, keeping the RMS of the signal distribution as
low as possible. We have found that the compromise is reached at U ≈ 110V
(see ﬁg.10) for the photodiode used.

We have calculated the MIP detection eﬃciency (the ratio of the number of

5

events in the signal distribution above 2σ from the pedestal to the number
of all events in the signal distribution) for diﬀerent bias voltages (ﬁg.12).
Another important issue is the ability to separate clearly the signals from
muons (MIP ) and electrons. For example, for the LHCb preshower detector
the signal is considered as a MIP when it is by ﬁve times lower than the muon
MP V . Otherwise it is treated as an electron signal. A separation ratio (the
ratio of the number of the events in signal distribution below 5MP V to the
number of all events in the signal distribution) as a function of the bias voltage
is presented in ﬁg.13. For the bias voltage of 110 V we have satisfactory levels
for the detection eﬃciency ≈ 85% and a separation ratio of ≈ 95%.

We also have performed tests with diﬀerent gates (ﬁg.11) in order to investigate
the behavior of the readout system in various readout schemes. The best result
for the S/N ratio is when the ADC gate is near to full width of the signal
(160ns). At narrower gates (for example 50ns) S/N decreases by 25%. At
wider gates S/N falls down rapidly because much more noise is integrated.

7 Conclusions

Avalanche photodiodes were tested as a scintilator tile-ﬁber readout for CMS
HCAL and LHCb ECAL preshower. Various types of ﬁbres were investigated
and Bicron 99-172 one was determined to be the most eﬃcient. A low noise
charge sensitive preampliﬁer with ≈ 400e− equivalent charge noise was de-
signed to gain signal from photodiodes. For LHCb ECAL preshower scintila-
tor a Signal/Noise ratio of 6.5 and for CMS HCAL scintillator Signal/Noise
ratio of 1.3 were achieved cooling the APDs down to −10oC. A satisfactory
MIP detection eﬃciency of ≈ 85% and an excellent e−/MIP separation of
≈ 95% for preshower scintilator were reached.

We would like to express our gratitude to Dr. Y. Musienko for the useful dis-
cussions and consultations and to P.Slavchev (”Inter Q” Ltd.) for developing
and manufacturing the cooling device.

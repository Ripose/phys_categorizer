Abstract

The paper describes the SPHINX facility which includes a wide-aperture magnetic spec-
trometer with scintillation counters and hodoscopes, proportional chambers and drift tubes,
multichannel electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, a guard system, a RICH velocity spec-
trometer and a hodoscopical threshold Cherenkov detector for the identiﬁcation of charged
secondary particles. The SPHINX spectrometer, in its last modiﬁcation, had the possibility to
3000–4000 trigger events per an accelerator burst. The spectrometer was used during
record
the last decade in experiments with the 70 GeV proton beam of the IHEP accelerator U-70.

Introduction

In 1989–1999 extensive studies of diﬀractive-like baryon production and OZI suppressed reactions,
searches for exotic and cryptoexotic pentaquark states and several other rare processes were carried
out in experiments with the SPHINX facility at the proton beam of the IHEP accelerator with
energy Ep = 70 GeV. The SPHINX facility was the multipurpose wide-aperture spectrometer with
the possibility of complete reconstruction of charged and neutral secondary particles. Over the
time several modiﬁcations of the SPHINX detector were made and all the measurements can be
divided into two stages:

a) First generation experiments with the “old” setup, performed in 1989–1994. The main results
of these measurements were published between 1994-2000 (see [1–13] and review papers [14,
15]). The short description of the ﬁrst version of the SPHINX detector can be found in [1].

b) Second generation experiments with the completely upgraded SPHINX detector, which is

described in this paper.

The “old” and upgraded SPHINX setup had the same general structure. However, after the up-
grade the facility was equipped with a new tracking system, new hodoscopes, a hadron calorimeter
and a modernized RICH velocity spectrometer, new electronics, a new DAQ system and on-line
computers. As a result we obtained, practically, a new setup which was capable to record an order
of magnitude more data per spill.

The layout of the upgraded SPHINX detector is presented in Fig. 1. The right-handed X, Y, Z
coordinate system of the setup had Z-axis in the direction of the proton beam, vertical Y -axis and
horizontal X-axis. The origin of the coordinate system was in the center of the Magnet.

The main elements of the detector were as follows:

results of these studies were published in [16–18].

The proton beam was transported to the setup by the multipurpose beam-line channel [19]. This,

The position information of incident particles was measured with the scintillator hodoscopes

The H1X,Y were made of ﬁber bundles manucatured by KURARAY. Each bungle consisted
of six layers of individually coated SCSF78M ﬁbers, 0.5 mm in diameter each, glued together.
The non-transparent two layer coating served for reducing an inter-ﬁber light interference. The
hodoscope sensitive regions were 32 mm. The ﬁbers were 350 mm long. They were divided by
groups so that each group corresponded to 2 mm in the direction perpendicular to the beam.
The ends were polished and each group was attached to the individual PM FEU-85. Thus each
hodoscope had 16 channels in total.

The H2X,Y were made of ﬁber bundles manufactured in the IHEP (Protvino, Russia). The
ﬁbers had a single layer coating and were much bigger in diameter (3.6 mm). There were only two
layers of ﬁbers in the beam direction shifted in respect to each other by half of the diameter. The

chains.

3 Targets and guard system

Two targets T1 (Cu; 2.64 g/cm2) and T2 (C; 11.3 g/cm2) were separated by a distance of 25 cm
and surrounded by a system of counters. The system included the scintillator hodoscope H3 and
A4, located around the targets, and A5,6 (physically it was one counter
the veto counters A1 −
seen by two PMs) which covered the forward direction. Another part of the veto system — the

counters A7, A8 were located further downstream, just before H4X hodoscope, at the entrance to
the magnet. The holes in the counter A5,6 and the distance between A7, A8 were matched with the
acceptance of the spectrometer. The A7, A8 veto counters are shown schematically in the ﬁgure.
In reality these two rectangular plates covered the entrance to the magnet from the top and the

150 cm3 and pT = 0.588 GeV/c. The spectrometer
uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the volume of 100
was equipped with the proportional chambers (PC), the drift tubes (DT) and the hodoscopes H4X,
H5X, H6X, H7, H8Y . The information from hodoscopes was used to generate trigger signals and
also to improve the performance of the track ﬁnding procedure.

∼
C4H7OH (2%). The overall eﬃciency of the chambers was found to be greater than 95%.

4.2 Drift tubes

The DT system was the 18 plane assembly. Each plane consisted of 32 thin-walled aluminum-
mylar round tubes with inner diameter of 62 mm. Each two consecutive planes formed a layer
so that the planes had the same orientation and a 10 mm shift along the sensitive axis. The
structure of the layers was as follows: 2X 2S1 2X 2S2 2X 2S1 2X 2S2 2X, where X corresponded
to vertically aligned tubes, S1,2, so-called “stereo”-layers, had tubes inclined by 7.5◦ and
7.5◦
from the vertical direction correspondingly. The distance between tube centers in the plane was
62.5 mm, the distance between centers of planes in the layer was 64 mm, the distance between
centers of adjacent planes belonging to diﬀerent layers was also 64 mm.

−

Each tube was made of 15 µm thick aluminum foil and tree layers of 70 µm thick mylar [21]
(see Fig. 2a). It had one central anode wire (gold-plated tungsten, 50 µm diameter) and four ﬁeld-
shaping wires (stainless steel, 200 µm diameter). A voltage of
4 kV was applied to all 5 wires, the
tube walls were grounded and served as cathodes. The ﬁeld-shaping wires were needed to overcome
the known drawback of “classic” DT where the fast decrease of electric ﬁeld strength (as 1/r, where
r was the distance from the anode wire) did not allow, in practice, to achieve the electron drift
velocity saturation for tubes with the diameter larger than 30 mm. The ﬁeld-shaping wires allowed
to concentrate the electric ﬁeld lines coming from the anode wire in the narrow (about 10 mm
wide) region (Fig. 2b). The electric ﬁeld strength suﬃcient for the drift velocity saturation could
be achieved that way.

∼

The geometry of the DT assembly was designed so that, if properly positioned, a beam crossed
each plane at approximately the center of the 16-th tube. The sensitivity in these beam regions in
such tubes was lowered by reducing the electric ﬁeld strength there with a special electrode. The
electrode was a 5 cm aliminum foil and mylar cylinder with a diameter equal to the inner diameter
of the tube with a separate voltage applied to it. The gas mixture of Ar (88%) + CO2 (12%) was
used with the tubes. Besides being inﬂammable, cheap and easily accessible this mixture is known
to have a property that the drift velocity saturation can be achieved at quite low electric ﬁeld
strength (700–800 V/cm).

The readout electronics included linear shaping preampliﬁers (tube mounted), multiplexors and
80 ns, the threshold
time-digital converters (TDC) [22]. The shaping time of the preampliﬁer was
sensitivity was 1.5 µA. The multiplexor had 40 paraphase 20 Ω input channels (only 32 were really
used fed by twisted pairs coming from the tubes of one plane) and 16 analog output channels
connected to TDCs. The multiplexors allowed to record up to 4 time hits from 32 tube plane using
only 16 one-hit TDCs. For that inputs/outputs of the multiplexor were divided for four groups
12-4-4-12/4-4-4-4 so that the each group consisted of 12 side or 4 central tubes was served by 4
TDCs. It worked as follows: the tube numbers corresponding to the ﬁrst hit in the group were
memorized and the ﬁrst TDC channel was activated to measure its time, the second TDC channel
was activated in response to the second hit and so on. The smaller number of tubes in two central
groups accounted for the heavier load at the central part of the plane. The time separation between
20 ns. The TDC had a bin width 0.3 ns with integral nonlinearity

The space resolution of the DT system was found to be

4.3 Downstream hodoscopes

×

The H4X hodoscope located at the entrance to the magnet was made of 10 mm thick scintillator
manufactured in Kharkhov (USSR). Dimensions of each of 24 elements seen by PMs from one side
were 26

400 mm2.

The H5X hodoscope, located downstream of the magnet, was made of 10 mm thick extruded

The H7 hodoscope, located just after the Cherenkov detector ˇC, had a cell structure. The
300 mm2 was geometrically
matrix 8
matched with 8
4 mirror matrix inside the Cherenkov detector. Such a system could be used for
trigger decisions. The scintillator was manufactured in Kharkov. Each plate was attached to an
individual PM.

Following H7 the hodoscope H8Y physically consisted of two assemblies placed so that one
corresponded to negative and the other one to positive x-coordinates with a small overlap (see
Fig. 1). That allowed to cover the aperture of 2.8 m in horizontal direction. Each assembly consisted

and seen by PMs from one side. Thus the hodoscope could measure 32 diﬀerent Y-coordinates and
had 64 channels.

All cut surfaces of hodoscope elements were polished. Each element was wrapped with alu-
minized mylar. All the PMs were of FEU-85 type with the additional magnetic ﬁeld shielding con-
sisted of multiple layers of Permalloy. Last dinodes of the PMs attached to the central hodoscope
elements which were located in the beam region and worked at higher intensity were powered from
separate high voltage sources to improve their stability. Signals from PMs were transported via
50 m long 50 Ω coaxial cables to latches of registering electronics.

5 Cherenkov counters

The system of Cherenkov counters served for the identiﬁcation of secondary particles and included
the RICH velocity spectrometer and hodoscope-like threshold Cherenkov counter ˇC.

Schematic view of the RICH detector is presented in Fig. 3. The vessel of the detector was
made of steel, 150 cm long and 70 cm in diameter. It consisted of two parts to allow easy access to
photodetectors. Entrance and exit ﬂanges were made of 0.8 mm aluminum.

Sulfurhexaﬂuoride (SF6), also known as elegas, was used as a radiator. The working pressure
was slightly above atmospheric one (up to 10–15%). The typical value of the refractive index was
1.0008, what corresponded to the π/K/p threshold momenta of 3.5/12.4/23.6 GeV/c.

The optical system consisted of 2 identical spherical (F = 125 cm) glass mirrors of rectangular
35 cm2) shape. The important features of the detector were that the mirrors were thin (0.5 cm)
(30
and each mirror focused light into one photomatrix, thus avoiding the need for precise alignment
before the run.

Photodetector consisted of 2 photomatrices, each having 23 rows and 16 columns, 736 photo-
multipliers in total. Phototubes were hexagonally packed with 1.5 cm step (see Fig. 4 for layout).
Russian-made FEU-60 phototubes with glass entrance window and 1.0 cm photocathode diameter
were used. To improve light registration eﬃciency aluminized mylar cones and wavelength shifters
(WLSs) were utilized.

≃

WLSs were made according to the technology developed at IHEP. A thin (20 µm) ﬁlm was
covered by the
5 µm thick transparent layer of p-terphenyl. Circle shape cutouts of such ﬁlm
based WLSs were attached to the FEU-60 entrance windows with an optical grease. The WLSs
allowed to utilize the ultraviolet part of Cherenkov light spectrum (which would be otherwise
absorbed by glass windows) by shifting it to wavelengths of maximum spectral sensitivity of the
PMs. The number of Cherenkov photons emitted per unit wavelength is deﬁned by the formula
1/λ2 which shows that a signiﬁcant gain can be achieved by using the more intense
dN/dλ
shortwave part of the spectrum. According to [25, 26] the sensitivity of glass window PMs with
p-terphenyl based WLSs can be increased by a factor of 2–3.5. Measurements carried out at IHEP
with the MgF2 crystalline radiator, a batch of FEU-60 PMs and the described WLSs showed the
increase in the number of photoelectrons by a factor of 2.5.

Phototubes had operating voltage in the 1–2 kV range. They were powered via resistor chains,
which provided the possibility of the voltage adjustment for each tube. Preampliﬁers with a sen-
sitivity of 3–5 mV/µA were attached to the phototubes. Ampliﬁed signals were transmitted via
2 m long coaxial cables to the discriminators with 10 mV threshold, which were located outside the
vessel. The discriminators generated diﬀerential ECL signals which were transmitted with twisted
pairs to the latches of custom-made registering electronics.

The performance characteristics of RICH are given in Table 2 (see [27] for more details on the

RICH).

the hodoscope H7 (the matrix of the same size) allowed to construct simple particle identiﬁcation
requirements which could be used in the trigger.

6 Electromagnetic calorimeter

A multichannel lead glass electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) had been previously used in the
EHS experiment at CERN [28] (known as Intermediate Gamma Detector there). It had a standard
design of a two-dimensional lead glass matrix which allowed to measure both the position and the
energy of a shower.

The initial assembly was rearranged to reduce the originally big central hole to the size of one
counter. The hole was still needed to let the beam pass through. The ECAL array of 39
1
counters covers a surface of 1.95
vertical). The individual counters with
42 cm3 were made of lead glass F8 manufactured in USSR, with radiation length
5
dimensions 5
X0 = 2.8 cm. The ECAL was mounted on a movable two-coordinate platform so that each counter
could be calibrated individually by exposing it to an electron beam.

8 Trigger

The two-level trigger scheme was used with the SPHINX facility (to reduce DAQ system dead
time). At zero level so called strobe signals were generated. There were three diﬀerent strobe

Their logical “OR” was one of the input signals for the next level trigger. The Gate was synchronized

the signal from the prescaling generator reducing the original rate of this strobe by a factor of

16000.
The block of the ﬁrst level trigger logic allowed to generate up to eight signals using as primitive
elements information from scintillation and veto counters, multiplicity of hits in the hodoscopes
and the threshold Cherenkov counter and total energy sum in the ECAL. It also produced the
logical “OR” of the above signals which served as a “general” trigger and started event readout.

or beam trigger — prescaled trigger on a beam particle.

All these trigger signals could be used simultaneously. In reality, diﬀerent subsets of them were
used during diﬀerent periods of data taking runs. This allowed to select many exclusive reactions
and calibration processes, part of which will be discussed in section 11.

9 DAQ hardware

DAQ architecture was based on IHEP developed MISS standard [30]. Some modules were in IHEP
SUMMA standard [31]. The system topology had four-level structure:

1. Front-end electronics level (lowest one) included modules of latches, TDCs and ADCs as
well as crate controllers and special module controllers. All modules were of either MISS or
SUMMA types.

2. Branch buﬀer memory level served as an intermediate storage of event information from

a single branch and for partial event building. All modules were of MISS type.

3. System buﬀer memory level served as an intermediate storage of event information from
the whole system and for event building. Its design was similar to the branch buﬀer memory
level.

4. Data accumulation level (spill data level) built a packet containing information on all
events happened during one spill. In addition, apparatus control and monitoring functions
were performed at this level.

Table 3 gives the numbers of channels used to record physical information for the SPHINX
setup arranged by module type. All inter-level connections were also designed according to MISS

speciﬁcations. More information on the electronics used in the system can be found in [32–35].

The general scheme of the SPHINX DAQ system is shown in Fig. 5. The lowest (ﬁrst) level
had 25 sectors1 of registering electronics. Each sector of the second level was connected to 2–9
ﬁrst level sectors to keep data ﬂow at the optimum level. The system could use SUMMA crates
as MISS sectors at the ﬁrst level. Additional special controllers in such crates simulated standard
MISS controllers. These SUMMA crates contained modules of a trigger logic.

The working algorithm was fully based on standard MISS procedures. The “begin of spill”
signal started a reset cycle. Event selection was done in two stages with generating of strobe
signals and trigger signals at the ﬁrst and the second stage correspondingly. A set of strobe signals
was produced by a strobe-block and an auxiliary logic fed by information from the beam counters
and the guard system. The logical “OR” of these signals allowed registering information from
hodoscopes, PC and RICH (all latches). It also put the strobe-block into a busy state preventing
it from generating further strobes. The information on strobe type, multiplicity in the particular
set of hodoscopes and on energy deposited in the ECAL came to a trigger block [36] where the
ﬁnal decision on whether to accept an event or not was made. If it was negative, the fast reset

1the MISS sector is a group of 8–24 modules sharing the same ECL bus, see [30] for details.

signal was distributed to the activated part of the electronics followed by clearing the strobe-block
busy state. If positive, the information from the ECAL, the HCAL and the DT was registered.
This signal also initiated the process of the front-end electronics readout and moving the data to
the next level. This was accompanied by extending the strobe/trigger logic busy state for the time
of the readout. When done the busy state was cleared and the system was ready for further data
taking. As the data collection proceeded, the information moved up through the intermediate levels
and was accumulated at the top level.

Thus, given that the “begin of spill” signal was provided, the hardware part of the DAQ system
was capable to collect, build and store the information on the events collected during the spill
according to trigger types programmed into the trigger block without any outside intervention.
This information was stored in the 16 MB buﬀer memory module of the top level VME crate.

The “begin of spill” signal was provided by a software. The software also generated additional
trigger signals of special types for calibration data collection and saved all the collected data to a
permanent storage media.

Some basic DAQ characteristics are given in the Table 4.

10 DAQ and online software

The DAQ software provided the following functions: start/stop of the basic data collection mode
(which includes calibration data collection), writing the collected data to disks and/or magnetic
tapes, online apparatus monitoring, initiating special modes for apparatus and DAQ tests and
calibrations.

The DAQ software worked mostly under LynxOS operating system installed on a one-board
MVME-167 computer with Motorola-68040 CPU and 16 MB of memory. The computer was located
in the top level VME crate. The top level memory buﬀer (also 16 MB) located in the same crate
was mapped to the computer memory address space so that it could be accessed by the processor
as a part of its own memory.

The software design allowed to distribute a part of the event ﬂow (including the whole) to
consumers on other computers via Ethernet. The online monitoring worked this way so that
apparatus control parameters could be analyzed with two workstation (DECStation 5200 and Silicon
Graphics Indy) working under UNIX-type OS.

The software had the following modules (programs):

1. a dispatcher managing the whole system;

2. data collection modules;

3. disks/tapes writing modules;

12

Figure 5: Scheme of the DAQ of the SPHINX setup

4. data distributor;

5. DAQ test and control modules;

6. apparatus test and calibration modules.

The dispatcher was the core of the system. It accepted messages from the connecting modules and
communicated them to other modules according to the type of the sending module and the message
content for actions.

The data collection modules consisted of the main program working on in-spill information and
auxiliary programs which were not necessarily spill-tied. The main program activated by the “begin
of spill” signal (coming from an accelerator control apparatus), initialized the DAQ apparatus and
initiated three special sequences: for pedestal measurements, for collecting data with the ECAL
and the RICH monitoring systems, for collecting TDC calibration data. By the “end of spill” signal
it also sent the message with parameters of the collected data buﬀer to the dispatcher thus making
this information available for other modules. Another data collection module read out scalers. The

13

reading sequence started by the end of the spill. The collected information then was communicated
(through the dispatcher) for writing to disks and for displaying the scalers readings.

The data could be written to disk ﬁles which could be then written to tapes or directly to tapes

(an Exabyte drive was attached to the MVME-167).

There was the distributing module which could send out the information on the uniform subset
of events via Ethernet. This was used for the online apparatus monitoring. On the other side
(workstations) the information was further distributed to diﬀerent analyzing processes (analyzers).
It was done in the framework of UNIDAQ system [37, 38]. One of the advantages of this system
was that analyzers were diﬀerent programs which had a standard piece of code allowing them to
connect to the central distributing unit (NOVA) and got the data. Thus they could be written
by diﬀerent people for diﬀerent purposes. There were analyzers for ﬁlling and displaying control
histogram, for single event display, for online chamber eﬃciency measurements with tracks, for
testing the structure of events built by electronics, for monitoring recoverable electronic failures.
Another special analyzer monitored some, presumably constant, setup parameters and produced
an information message on a main console accompanied by an alarm signal if these parameters
came out of predeﬁned windows.

The DAQ system could be controlled by sending messages to diﬀerent modules or to all modules
at once with the special program. There was a set of programs for the DAQ hardware testing and
debugging and also for the apparatus testing and calibrations.

Illustration of the experimental possibilities

In this section we will consider very brieﬂy several possibilities for the measurements with the
SPHINX facility with diﬀerent triggers.

The three-track trigger T(3) (4) was the main trigger for the measurement with the SPHINX spec-
trometer. It allowed to study simultaneously the exclusive reactions:

These triggers (6) and (7) were used for the study of quasi-exclusive forward meson production in
proton reactions in deep fragmentation region (inclusive for bottom vertex) [11]:

→

|forward + (X)

|bottom vertex

These deep fragmentation processes can be accompanied by substantial quark rearrangement, gluon
forward bremsstrahlung and open new possibilities for the search for exotic meson production [39].

The possibilities to select some of the above reactions are illustrated in Fig. 6–7 reproduced
from [17]. Reactions (9), (10), (18) were used for the search for the exotic pentaquark baryon
Θ(1540)+ with positive strangeness and uudd¯s quark structure in the mass spectra of [nK +], [pK 0
S],
[pK 0
L] systems [17]. Reactions (15), (16) were used for the search for the cryptoexotic X(2000)
baryon with hidden strangeness (uuds¯s) in the mass spectra M (Σ0K +) and M (Σ+K 0
S) [3, 6, 8, 9,
12, 13, 16].

The SPHINX facility had the good guard system allowing to suppress background processes
Λγ

with “lost photons”. That opened the possibility to study the rare radiative decay Λ(1520)
in the reaction (17) — see Fig. 8 reproduced from [18].

12 Conclusion

The multipurpose wide-aperture SPHINX spectrometer, in its several modiﬁcations, was used in
the experiments at the proton beam of IHEP U-70 accelerator in 1989–1999 [1–18]. The good
quality of this setup with the possibility of the complete reconstruction of charged and neutral sec-
ondary particles and large collected statistics allowed to get many results on the study of diﬀractive
production reactions, searches for new states of hadronic matter, study of the radiative decays of
hyperons, OZI rule and deep fragmentation reactions [1–18] and opened new perspectives for further
investigations of these and other rare processes.

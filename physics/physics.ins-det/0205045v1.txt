Abstract

The performance of the photon detector constructed for the search of T-
violation in the decay K + → π0µ+ν is presented. The speciﬁc features of this
detector consisting of 768 CsI(Tl) crystals with PIN photodiode readout for
high precision measurement of T-odd correlations in decays of positive kaons
are considered.

1 Introduction

The main goal of experiment E246 at the KEK 12 GeV proton synchrotron is a search
for T–violating transverse muon polarization (PT ) in the decay K + → π0µ+ν (Kµ3)
with a sensitivity of about ∆PT ∼ 10−3. The Standard Model predictions for PT is
less than 10−7 [1, 2] and a contribution from the ﬁnal state interactions was found
to be below the 10−5 level [3]. So, this experiment is able to search for additional or
alternative sources of CP-violation postulated in various extensions to the Standard
Model. In particular it is sensitive to the CP-violation in the multi Higgs doublet
models, the leptoquark models and supersymmetric models with/without R–parity
violation, where PT can reach the measurable level of 10−4 − 10−2 [4].

The E246 detector was commissioned in 1996 and accumulated data for about 6
years. First results with a new limit on PT were published in [6]. In this experiment,
the Kµ3 decay is identiﬁed by detecting the π0 as well as the µ+ from the decay. The
layout of the E246 set–up is shown in Fig. 1. A 660 MeV/c kaon beam is slowed
down in a BeO degrader and stopped in an active target, made of 256 5 × 5 mm2
scintillating ﬁbers. The energy and direction of the π0 from the Kµ3 decay are mea-
sured by a segmented CsI(Tl) photon detector installed in the central region of the

toroidal magnet. A muon from the Kµ3 decay at rest is momentum–analyzed by one
of the 12 magnet gaps of the superconducting toroidal spectrometer using tracking
performed by the stopping target, a scintillating ring hodoscope [5] surrounding the
target, and three MWPCs. The muon exiting the spectrometer is stopped in a po-
larimeter in which the decay positron asymmetry AT is measured in order to obtain
PT . The polarimeter consists of 12 azimuthally arranged Al stoppers, aligned with
the magnet gaps, with a scintillator counter system located between the stoppers.
A positron from the decay of µ+ → e+νν tends to be emitted in the same direc-
tion as the muon spin, and is detected by these plastic scintillator counters. In this
detector AT appears as a diﬀerence in the counting rate between clockwise (cw)
and counter-clockwise (ccw) emitted positrons. By summing the cw (Ncw) and ccw
(Nccw) positron counts over all 12 sectors, PT is derived from

where α is the analyzing power of the polarimeter and f is an attenuation factor
which reﬂects the fact that the decay plane of the Kµ3 event determined from the
µ+ and π0 momenta is not parallel to the median plane of the gap in which the
muon momentum is measured.

The photon detector plays a crucial role in this experiment for suppression of
systematic errors. Using complete reconstruction of the Kµ3 kinematics we separate

these events into two classes: events with the pion moving along the kaon beam
(forward direction) and those where the pion moves in the backward direction. The
sign of PT for the forward-going π0 events is opposite to that for backward-going π0
events. This allows us to apply a double ratio between the forward- and backward-
going π0 events cancelling out most instrumental sources of false polarization, which
are likely to be independent of the π0 direction. This method is an unique feature
of E246 experiment, and is a key factor for eﬀective suppression of most systematic
errors.

2 Overall description of the calorimeter

The photon detector consists of 768 CsI(Tl) crystals each with a PIN photodiode
readout. They form a barrel structure that covers about 75% of 4π with 12 sym-
metrically spaced holes for µ+s going into the magnetic spectrometer (Fig. 2).

holes. The optically isolated CsI modules point towards the center of the active
target. An individual crystal covers 7.5◦ in both polar and azimuthal angles, except
for 48 crystals near to the beam axis, where the azimuthal angle was doubled to
15◦, and the muon hole region. The crystal length of 250 mm (13.5 r.l.) was chosen
in order to leave about 4 cm of space available radially to mount a PIN-diode and
preampliﬁer. The overall gain stability of the calorimeter is monitored by a Xe–lamp
light pulser system with optical ﬁbers which distribute the light from the lamp to
the crystals.

To obtain uniform high light yield along the crystal, the crystal surfaces were
treated to grade the reﬂectivity, and a Millipore white paper was chosen as a reﬂector
(see for details Ref. [7]). As a result, for almost all modules the light yield of more
than 8000 p.e./MeV and the average equivalent noise level (ENL) of about 63 keV
were obtained, as shown in Fig. 3. The whole detector demonstrated a low level of

energy resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the detector. These parameters are the
best among the large CsI(Tl) calorimeters which have been built in recent time [9].
To eﬃciently use the high light yield and low ENL of individual crystals, the
electronics for the calorimeter was specially designed. The high counting rate envi-
ronment in the calorimeter due to pion contamination in the beam was also taken
into account in the design. The calorimeter electronics is schematically shown in
Fig. 4 and described in detail in Ref. [10]. The main ampliﬁer incorporates a shaping
ampliﬁer with fast restoration of the base level and a timing ﬁlter ampliﬁer which

forms a timing signal for a subsequent discrimination by a constant fraction discrim-
inator (CFD). The CsI timing signals from all CFD outputs are used in the second
level trigger in coincidence with the ﬁrst level fast trigger.

The detector stability is monitored by a Xe–lamp system. During the nearly 6
year period of operation none of the 768 photodiodes and only two preampliﬁers
failed. A light yield degradation of the CsI modules of about 12% was observed over
this time.

3 Performance

3.1

In-beam calibration

The in-beam calibration of the detector was carried out using muons from the dom-
inant decay mode K + → µ+ν of stopped kaons. These muons have a kinetic energy
of 152.4 MeV and are stopped in the CsI crystals. The calibration runs, which were
carried out every beam cycle, used a reduced beam intensity and a special trigger.
It included the kaon identiﬁcation with the Cherenkov detector, kaon stop in the
target, and the presence of a signal in the CsI. In–ﬂight kaon decays were avoided
by introducing a 15–ns time delay. The events in which no energy was detected in
the neighboring crystals were selected to obtain the individual gains of CsI mod-
ules. The kaon decay vertex was reconstructed from µ+ tracking and muon energy
losses in the target were corrected using the target ﬁber ADC information [11]. Us-
ing individual CsI calibration coeﬃcients the decay K + → π+π0 is reconstructed.
Fig. 5 shows the spectrum of the energy sum of two photon clusters from the decay
π0 → γγ. The peak value 235.7 MeV corresponds to about 96% of the Eπ0=245.6
MeV, that is consistent with the result of Monte Carlo calculation for the cluster
size of 5×5 crystals. The low energy tail is due to the shower leakage into the muon
and beam holes, and through the rear sides of the crystals. The resolution σE/E
obtained for the energy sum of two photons from Kπ2 decay is 5.2%. The energy
resolution is better for clusters away from muon holes, as seen from Fig. 5(b). The

invariant mass resolution of the π0 was 6.7% for whole detector and 5.6% for events
with both photons detected away from muon holes.

3.2 Time resolution

Good time resolution is an important factor for reliable identiﬁcation of photons and
neutral pions from the decays of K +’s and for background suppression. The time
resolution was determined in physics runs by measuring time diﬀerence between a
muon signal from Kµ3 decay produced by one of the 12 ﬁducial plastic counters
surrounding the target, and a CFD signal from a CsI module. Fig. 6 shows energy
dependence of the obtained time resolution (σ) of the CsI crystals which are the
centers of the gamma clusters. Time resolution of 3.5 ns at 100 MeV deteriorates
to 16.8 ns in the low energy range of 10–20 MeV. For the Kµ3 photon energy range
of 10-250 MeV the resolution σ = 3.8 nsec was obtained. To exploit the timing
performance, all the CsI CFD outputs were added to the trigger logic as the OR
strobe. A 150 ns discriminator pulse width was suﬃcient to accept nearly all good
events, while reducing the recorded trigger rate by a factor of 2.

3.3 Counting rate

The slow decay time of CsI(Tl) crystals can lead to losses of detected events in
a high intensity beam due to pile-up of the CsI pulses. The large contamination

of pions in the beam (π/K ≥ 6) and an asymmeterical pion halo were the main
sources which dominated the counting rate in the calorimeter. The counting rate
of a crystal depends on its position relative to the beam axis and was dramatically
increased for the crystals closest to the beam, as seen in Fig. 7. Taking into account
the distribution of the events over the solid angle, the average counting rate per
ctystal in the experiment was determined to be about 8 kHz. The tests of baseline
stabilty at this counting rate using Xe–lamp events showed that about 5% of events
were lost in physics runs due to pile up.

3.4 Detector alignment

The limited accuracy of the detector installation can make an asymmetry in the
angular distribution between the median plane of the polarimeter and Kµ3 decay
plane, the normal vector ~n to which is deﬁned as

~n =

~pπ0 × ~pµ+
| ~pπ0 × ~pµ+ |

.

(2)

Here ~pπ0 and ~pµ+ are the momenta of the pion and muon, respectively. This angular
asymmetry can give rise to contamination of the in-plane polarization and can gen-
erate a spurious T-odd eﬀect due to the opposite direction of this polarization for

the forward- and backward-going pions. According to the Monte Carlo simulation,
the residual value of the muon in-plane polarization in the polarimeter is 0.5–0.7 for
both directions of the neutral pions. The measured angular distributions of Kµ3 de-
cay plane rotations around the beam direction (z-axis) and radial direction (r-axis,
perpendicular to the beam and lying in the median plane of a magnet sector, see
Fig. 1(c)) are presented in Fig. 8. As one can see, the detector provides good angu-
lar symmetry, and possible spurious polarization caused by detector misalignment
is ≤ 3.7 × 10−4, i.e. much less than the expected statistical error.

3.5 Double ratio

To measure the power of the double ratio, the compensation of a large imitation
asymmetry in the experimental kaon stopping distribution was studied for the good
forward and backward Kµ3 events. The events accumulated in 1998 running cycle
were selected, in the right-hand part of the target relative to the median plane in
each magnet sector looking upstream the beam, as shown in Fig. 9. As a result,
in each gap a spurious asymmetry of 2–6% appears, as seen in Fig. 10, and total
asymmetry is AF = −2.90 ± 0.21% and AB = −2.65 ± 0.21% for forward and
backward events, respectively. So, the double ratio

(AF + AB)/(AF − AB) ≃ 22

provides a large factor for cancellation of systematic errors in the asymmetry mea-
surement. For diﬀerent data sets this factor was determined to be in the range of
15-24.

4 Conclusion

The CsI(Tl) photon detector with PIN photodiode readout is being successfully used
in the E246 experiment at KEK. The overall performance of the calorimeter was
not degraded signiﬁcantly after being in operation for 6 years. The CsI calorimeter
provides good reconstruction of the π0 parameters and seems to be a key instrument
for reduction of systematic uncertanties in the polarization measurement down to
the level of 10−3 that completely fulﬁlls the requirements of the experiment.

Abstract

The novel idea of water Cherenkov calorimeter made of water tanks as the next gen-
eration neutrino detector for ν factories and ν beams is investigated. A water tank
13m3 is constructed, its performance is studied
prototype with a dimension of 1
and compared with a GEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulation. By using measured
parameters of the water tank, including the light collection eﬃciency, attenuation
length, angular dependent response etc, a detailed Monte Carlo simulation demon-
strates that the detector performance is excellent for identifying neutrino charged
current events while rejecting neutral current and wrong-ﬂavor backgrounds.

1 Introduction

Neutrino factories and conventional beams have been discussed extensively [1,2]
as the facility of neutrino physics for the next decade. The main physics objec-
tives include the measurement of sin θ13, ∆m2
13, the leptonic CP phase δ and
the sign of ∆m2
23. All these quantities can be obtained through the disappear-
νµ) and the appearance probability P (νµ(νe)
ance probability P (νµ →
→
νe(νµ)) and P ( ¯νµ( ¯νe)
¯νe( ¯νµ)). To measure these quantities, a detector
→
should: 1) be able to identify leptons: e, µ and if possible τ ; 2) have good
pattern recognition capabilities for background rejection; 3)have good energy
resolution for event selection and to determine Pα→β(E); 4) be able to measure
the charge for µ± in the case of ν factories; and 5) be able to have a large
mass(100-1000kt) at an aﬀordable price.

Water is one of the most economic materials for large scale neutrino detectors.
Water Cherenkov ring image detectors have been successfully employed in
large scale experiments such as Super-Kamiokande [3], MiniBooNE [4] and
IMB [5], etc. However such kind of detectors are not suitable for neutrinos with
4GeV due to complications of showers, therefore not
an energy more than
the choice for very long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. The water
Cherenkov calorimeter made up by a matrix of water tanks, was proposed [6]
for the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

A water Cherenkov Calorimeter with a modular structure is shown in Fig.1.
13m3, corresponding to 2.77X0
Each tank has dimensions of about 1
and 1.5λ0 in its transverse dimension. The water tank is made of PVC with
reﬂective inner lining. Photons are collected at both end of the tank, hence
signiﬁcantly reducing the photon collection area and the cost. Cherenkov light
produced by charged particles in the water tank is estimated to be suﬃcient
for energy resolution, and position is determined by the arrival time of pho-
tons to the phototubes at both ends of the tank. The directional information
is obtained by the reconstruction of the event thrust. The event pattern in
energy and space in the water tank matrix can be used to identify neutrinos
undergoing charge current(CC) interactions, as shown in Fig. 1.a which is a
typical νµ CC event.

The water Cherenkov calorimeter is similar in a sense to the crystal calorimeter
at accelerator experiments. It is a cheap solution for the long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiments at a scale of 100-1000kt, and also applicable to cosmic-
ray physics and astrophysics. Reports about these kind of applications can
also be found in Ref. [7]. In this paper, we report our study with a prototype
and a Monte Carlo simulation using measured parameters of the water tank
performance for the identiﬁcation of neutrino CC events.

2 Water Tank Prototype

13m3
A water tank prototype [8] made of PVC with the dimension of 1
is built as shown in Fig. 2. The inner wall of the tank is covered by the
Tyvek ﬁlm 1070D from DuPont. At each end of the tank there is a Winston
cone [9] which can collect parallel light at its focal points, where an 8-inch
photomultiplier is installed. The Winston cone is again made of PVC, covered
by the aluminium ﬁlm with protective coating. Cherenkov light produced by
through-going charged particles are reﬂected by the Tyvek and the Al ﬁlm
and collected by the photomultiplier at the focus of the Winston cone. At the
top of the tank there is an air gap(about 1cm) above the water level which
serves as a total reﬂector for photons with certain incident angles.

tank is set as the origin of the coordinate system.

Tyvek is a diﬀuse reﬂector with a very high reﬂectivity which is measured in
the frequency range of visible light as shown in Fig. 3. Although it is naively
believed that mirror reﬂector such as the Al ﬁlm has a better light collection
for such a long optical module, our simulation shows that their performances
are actually very similar [10]. The dominant factor is the bulk reﬂectivity. The

3

good mechanical and chemical properties of the Tyvek ﬁlm lead us to use it
in order to have an easy handling and less aging eﬀect in the deionized water.
Tyvek as a reﬂector in water has been used by many experiments, including
Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, and Auger experiments [11].

Since the Winston cone needs a mirror reﬂection to collect light, a selected Al
ﬁlm is used. Al ﬁlm has a very high reﬂectivity( 98%) in theory, but is easy
to be oxidized in water and loss its reﬂectivity. A protective coating is hence
needed and the reﬂectivity is measured to be typically 90%, as shown in Fig.
3.

In order to have a good water transparency, the clean de-ionized water with
a resistance of more than 10MΩ
cm is used. The water is again puriﬁed by
a simple system with a 0.1µm ﬁlter, which can increase the transparency by
a factor of two. The water absorption length as a function of wavelength used
in Monte Carlo simulation is obtained by scaling down the curve from the
Auger experiment [12] based on our experimental data, as shown in Fig. 3.
The phototube used is 9350KB from EMI, and its quantum eﬃciency [13] is
shown in Fig. 3.

Cosmic-muons, triggered by two scintillator counters at the top and the bot-
tom of the tank, are the primary charged particles which generate Cherenkov
s, and the
photons. The muon ﬂux at the sea level is about 1.8
area of scintillation counters is 20cm
44cm, hence it takes typically 10 hours
×
to accumulate one spectrum. Such a small trigger counter is selected to control
the error due to the incident position, angle and the pass length of muons. A
displacement of one of the two trigger counters in x direction(see Fig. 2) can
deﬁne the incident angle of the muons. In addition, between two cosmic data
taking runs a calibration run with the trigger counters at x=0.5m was taken

The setup includes also a C205 ADC from CAEN to measure the charge of
muon and the single photoelectron for calibration, a N844 discriminator from
CAEN to generate trigger signals and the gate signal for ADC.

2.1 Monte Carlo Simulation

Since Geant4 provides quite powerful tools for describing the detector and the
relevant physics with a fairly ﬂexible optical model inspired by the work of
Nayer et al. [14], a GEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulation program of this
water tank prototype has been developed.

The so called UNIFIED model, which accommodates the principal features
of both physical and geometrical optical models of surface reﬂection over a
wide range of surface roughness and wavelengths, is used in our simulation.
The implementation of UNIFIED model requires the speciﬁcation of seven
free parameters [15]: n1 is the index of refraction of the incident medium;
n2 the index of refraction of the transmission medium; Csl the specular lobe
constant; Css the specular spike constant; Cbs the backscatter constant; Cdl
the diﬀuse lobe constant; and σα the RMS of the angle α between the average
surface normal and microfacet normals. Since the construction of the water
tank is similar in many ways to that of the Auger detector, some values of the
[16].
parameters in our simulation programs are selected to be very similar
We set Csl = 0.2 with the corresponding σα = 0.2, Css = Cbs = 0., and
Cdl = 0.8. n1 and n2 are from our experimental measurements. More details
about optical models and its parameters have been discussed in Ref. [10,17].

2.2 Experimental study of the Water Tank Prototype

2.2.1 PMT’s Single-photoelectron Spectrum

Single photoelectron spectrum(SPE) is measured before each run in order to
calibrate the system since signal amplitudes normalized to that of SPE provide
a unique measure of light collected by photomultipliers. SPE can be measured
in many ways, one of which is the so called ”thermal noise” method. In total
darkness, a photomultiplier can still generate pulses due to thermal emission
of single electron by photocathode, equivalent to the charge spectrum of single
photoelectron. Thermal emission of electrons by dynodes constitutes the noise
below the SPE peak. A SPE spectrum of the PMT 9350KB, applying a high
voltage of 1550V at the room temperature(about 15oC), is measured as shown
in Fig. 4. Since the ADC used is only 12 bit, the working voltage(1550V) of the

5

PMT is selected to avoid saturation of ADC for cosmic-muons at all positions
along the water tank. The SPE spectrum is obtained by a self-trigger with a
threshold of 2mV and a gate width of 100ns. The ﬁrst peak corresponds to
the pedestal, the second peak comes from the dynode noise above the 2mV
threshold, and the last peak is from SPE, whose position will be used as the
normalization to count number of photoelectrons.

Fig. 4. Single-photon spectrum of the PMT 9350KB at a
high voltage of 1550V.

The eﬀective attenuation length of water had worsened over time, hence cali-
bration runs were taken before each measurement, and all data points in the
late sections are after correction.

2.2.2 Position Dependent Response of the Water Tank

Light collected for cosmic-muons is a function of distance from the incident
point of the muon to the phototube, since the water transparency and reﬂec-
tivity of the Tyvek ﬁlm is not perfect. Such a position dependent response of
the tank is critical to its energy resolution and pattern recognition capability.
Typically it is characterized by an exponential behavior of e−x/λ, where x is
the distance of the muon event to the phototube and λ is the characteristic
parameter, often called ”eﬀective attenuation length”.

The characteristic parameter λ depends on the water transparency, the reﬂec-
tivity of the Tyvek ﬁlm, and the geometry of the tank. Fig. 5 shows the charge
spectrum collected at x=0.5m with an incident angle of 0o. Using the trigger
scintillation counters to deﬁne the muon incident location, keeping the y coor-
dinate constant as indicated in Fig. 2, the total light collected as a function of
x at several locations is obtained as shown in Fig. 6. An exponential ﬁt yields

both the eﬀective attenuation length and the angular dependent response.

20 photoelectrons by each PMT will be collected, cor-
of the tank, a total of
responding to a statistical ﬂuctuation of about 7%/√E. Based on the Monte
Carlo simulation, the number of photons at various stages of the photon trans-
port in the water tank is listed in table 1. From the table, about 74% of light
lost due to the Tyvek reﬂection and water absorption. The Winston cone has
a collection eﬃciency of 3.1%, same as the ratio of PMT surface area to that of
the water tank cross section. It means that the Winston cone did not improve
the light collection eﬃciency, but the uniformity of the light collection.

There are several ways to improve the light collection of the water tank: a) The
water absorption length can be improved with a more sophisticated puriﬁca-
tion system. In fact the Super-Kamiokande experiment reached an absorption
length of about 90m [18], a factor of 3 better than what was reached here; b)
The reﬂectivity of the inner liner can be improved by using newly developed
plastic reﬂectors, VM2000 or ESR from 3M Co. [19]. They have a reﬂectivity
better than 99%, which can increase the total light collected by more than
50%. In total, it is possible to increase the light collection by a factor of two,
corresponding to a statistical ﬂuctuation of about 5%/√E for each tank.

2.2.3 Angular Dependent Response of the water tank

Since Cherenkov light produced is not isotropic, and its direction is correlated
to that of the incident charged particles, the total light collected by phototubes
at each end of the water tank is also correlated to the incident angle of the
particles. By using trigger counters to deﬁne the angle as shown in Fig. 2,
response of the water tank to through-going charged muons with incident
angles varied from 0o to 50o are measured. The bottom trigger scintillator
is ﬁxed at x=0.5m, and the top trigger scintillator is moved along the -x
direction. After normalizing the track length to 1m, results are shown in Fig. 7a
together with predictions from the Monte Carlo simulation. Since the only free
parameter to be tuned in the Monte Carlo prediction is the overall scaling of
the water absorption length as discussed before, the good agreement between
data and Monte Carlo simulation for both eﬀective attenuation length and
the angular dependent response shows that the optical behavior of the water
tank is largely understood.

cate the statistical error of the Monte Carlo prediction. The
track length of all the data points are normalized to 1 meter;
b) Monte Carlo results of the angular response as a function
of distance from the incident point to the phototube.

As can be seen from Fig. 7a, the number of photoelectrons is approximate
constant for incident angles less then 30o. This is conﬁrmed by the Monte
Carlo simulation, and true at almost all locations of the tank, as shown in
Fig. 7b. This is signiﬁcant since during the event reconstruction, this factor
can be ignored and the energy resolution of neutrino event can be maintained
at a reasonably good level.

3 the Water Cherenkov Calorimeter for ν Detection

Water Cherenkov calorimeter for the neutrino detection has been studied by
using a GEANT3 based Monte Carlo simulation [6]. In this paper we report a

9

new study taking into account the water tank properties such as attenuation
length, light collection eﬃciency and its angular dependence, etc, based on
prototype measurements. The optical process inside the water tank is param-
eterized by an eﬃciency distribution, ǫ(θ, x), where θ is the incident angle of
charged particles and x the position of energy deposit. Such a parameteriza-
tion is obtained by a GEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulation as described in
section 2.2, and conﬁrmed by the prototype measurement as shown in Fig.7.

One possible application considered is the neutrino beam from JAERI [20] to
Beijing with a baseline of 2100km [2]. A total of 60k νe, νµ and ντ events(Fig.8)
are simulated using an event generator from the Minos experiment. A ν CC
signal event is identiﬁed by its accompanying lepton, reconstructed as a jet.
Fig. 9 shows the jet energy normalized by the energy of the lepton. It can be
seen from the plot that leptons from CC events can indeed be identiﬁed and
the jet reconstruction algorithm works properly. It is also shown in the ﬁgure
that the energy resolution of the neutrino CC events is about 13% in both
cases.

Since the detector is made of a matrix of water tanks(Fig.1), it’s convenient
and simple to obtain the following variables and their distributions for all
diﬀerent neutrino ﬂavors, which are very eﬀective to identify the neutrino CC
events:

•

L after shower maximum: the longitudinal length of the jet from the shower
maximum to the last cell, as shown in Fig. 10. Since leptons are only gen-
erated by CC process, this varible is good to distinguish the neutrino CC
events and NC events. After the application of the cut L > 10m, the re-

ergy. The fact that Ejet/Elepton peaks around one shows that
the jet reconstruction algorithm ﬁnds the lepton from CC
events. The fraction of total visible energy to the neutrino
energy indicates that we have an energy resolution better
than 13% for all neutrinos . The bias is due to invisible neu-
tral hadrons and charged particles below Cherenkov thresh-
olds.

maining νµ NC events is only 0.1%;
Rmax/Etot: the transverse event size at the shower maximum normalized to
the total visible energy Etot, as shown in Fig. 11. The diﬀerence between
CC and NC events is not too much, but combined with others cuts, it can
be used to eﬀectively remove the backgrounds from each neutrino ﬂavor.
Rxy/Etot: the transverse event size normalized to Etot, as shown in Fig. 12.
It’s useful for the νe and ντ events. For example, after application of the cut
Rxy/Etot < 10., the ratio of νe NC to CC events is about 0.38.
Ntank/Ejet: the number of cells with energy above the threshold(10MeV)
normalized to the jet energy of the event Ejet, as shown in Fig. 13. For the
νe and ντ events, most of NC events can be removed with certain range of
Ntank/Ejet.
Emax/Ejet: the maximum energy deposition in one cell normalized to Ejet,
as shown in Fig. 14. A total of 75.6% of νe CC events can be obtained after
the application of the cut 0.3 < Emax/Ejet < 0.6.

Table2 shows the ﬁnal results from this Monte Carlo study. It can be seen

that νe CC events can be selected with reasonable eﬃciency and moderate
backgrounds. For νe and νµ events, ντ CC events are dominant backgrounds,
while for ντ , the main background is νe. It is interesting to see that this
detector can identify ντ in a statistical way. With the application of the cut
Eν > 4GeV , much higher detection eﬃciencies of CC events can be obtained,
the results are shown in the Table3. These results are similar to or better than
those from water Cherenkov image detectors and iron calorimeters [21]. We
would like to point out that using sophisticated jet reconstruction algorithms,
shower shape analysis and neural network technique, better results are ex-
pected. Using Table2, we can explore the sensitivity of our detector to various
quantities, such as sin2 2θ13, CP phase,etc. Assuming that the systematic er-
ror is not dominant, a sensitivity of 0.2% to sin2 2θ13 at relevant ∆m2

13m3, made
A full size water tank prototype, with a dimension of 1
of PVC with reﬂective inner liner was built. The eﬀective attenuation length
and the angular response of the tank was measured, and good agreement
with a GEANT4 based full Monte Carlo simulation was obtained. The light
yield, the total light collection eﬃciency, the eﬀective attenuation length and
the angular dependent response of the tank are all good enough for the long
baseline neutrino oscillation experiment, and can be further improved. The
performance is excellent for νe and ντ appearance and νµ disappearance from
the GEANT3 based Monte Carlo simulation. The water Cherenkov calorimeter
is a cheap and eﬀective detector for ν factories and super ν beams, and such a
detector is also desirable for cosmic-ray physics and astrophysics.There are no

13

major technical diﬃculties although further R&D and detector optimization
are needed.

We investigate the recovery of superconducting NbN-nanowire photon counters after detection
of an optical pulse at a wavelength of 1550 nm, and present a model that quantitatively accounts
for our observations. The reset time is found to be limited by the large kinetic inductance of these
nanowires, which forces a tradeoﬀ between counting rate and either detection eﬃciency or active
area. Devices of usable size and high detection eﬃciency are found to have reset times orders of
magnitude longer than their intrinsic photoresponse time.

High-speed photon-counting detectors have many ap-
plications, including optical communications [1], quan-
tum information [2], biological physics [3], semiconduc-
tor processing [4], and laser radar [5]. Of particu-
lar interest would be a detector that combines ultra-
fast count rates (≥ GHz) with high single-photon de-
tection eﬃciency at near-infrared wavelengths; however,
current near-infrared photon-counting technologies such
as avalanche photodiodes [6] and photomultiplier tubes
[7] are limited to much lower count rates by long reset
times.

A promising detector technology was reported recently,
in which ultrathin superconducting NbN wires are biased
with a DC current Ibias slightly below the critical value IC
[8]. An incident photon of suﬃcient energy can produce
a resistive “hotspot” which in turn disrupts the super-
conductivity across the wire, resulting in a voltage pulse.
Observations of this photoresponse showed promise for
high counting rates, with measured intrinsic response
times as low as ∼30 ps [9], and counting rates in the
GHz regime [10, 11]. In this Letter, we present our own
investigation into the counting-rate limitation of these
devices, in which we directly observe the recovery of the
detection eﬃciency as the device resets (after a detection
event), and develop a quantitative model of this process.
We ﬁnd that detectors having both high detection eﬃ-
ciency and usable active area are limited to much lower
count rates than studies of their intrinsic response time
had suggested [9].

We fabricated our nanowires using a newly developed
process [12], on ultrathin (3 − 5 nm) NbN ﬁlms [13].
We used several geometries, including straight nanowires
having widths from 20−400 nm and lengths from 0.5−50
µm, as well as large-area “meander” structures [8, 10]
(e.g., Fig. 1(b)) having active-area aspect ratios from
1 − 50, ﬁll factors from 25 − 50%, and sizes up to 10-
µm square. The devices had critical temperatures TC ∼
9 − 10 K, and critical current densities JC ∼ 2 − 5 × 1010

FIG. 1: Schematic of the experimental setup. (a) A cryogenic
probing station allowed us to probe our devices both electri-
cally and optically. Our samples were 3 − 8 mm in size, and
typically contained from 50 − 150 individual, separately ad-
dressable detectors. (b) a scanning electron microscope image

“meander” structure [8, 10, 11].

A/m2. In total, ∼ 400 devices were tested, spanning sev-
eral diﬀerent fabrication runs.

The devices were cooled to as low as 2 K inside a cryo-
genic probing station (Desert Cryogenics), as illustrated
in Fig. 1(a). Electrical contact was established using a
cooled 50 Ω microwave probe (67 GHz bandwidth) at-
tached to a micromanipulator, and connected via coaxial
cable to the room-temperature electronics. Current bias
was supplied through the DC port of a bias T (Picosecond
Pulse Labs 5575A) using a battery-powered, adjustable
voltage reference in series with a 100 kΩ resistor. The
AC port of the bias T was connected through a 3 dB at-
tenuator [14] to two cascaded low-noise ampliﬁers (Miteq
JS2-00100400-10-10A), and then through a DC block [15]
(Inmet 8039) to a 6 GHz real-time oscilloscope (LeCroy

FIG. 2:
nanowires. Output pulses are shown for 100 nm wide wires at
T = 4.2 K, with Ibias = 11.5 µA, and dimensions: (a) 10 µm
× 10 µm meander (total length 500 µm); (b) 4 µm × 6 µm
(120 µm); (c) 3 µm × 3.3 µm (50 µm); (d) 5 µm-long single
wire. Red dotted lines show the predicted pulse recovery, with
no free parameters, for each device based on its measured
inductance: Lk = 415 nH, 110 nH, 44.5 nH, 6.10 nH. These
predictions include the eﬀect of the measured fL = 15 MHz
and fH = 4 GHz corner frequencies of our ampliﬁers, and
the assumptions: Iret ≪ Ibias, Rn ≫ 2πfHLk; (e) electrical
model; photon absorption corresponds to the switch opening;
(f) inductance at T = 4.2 K vs. room-temperature resistance
for 290 individual nanowires from 0.5 − 500 µm long and 20 −
400 nm wide, with both straight and “meander” geometries,
from two separate fabrication runs. Points corresponding to
the devices of (a)-(d) are indicated. The slope of a linear ﬁt
constrained to pass through the origin, shown by a solid line,
is 0.997 ± 0.002; this indicates that L ∝ R300K, and therefore
that L is predominantly a kinetic inductance.

Wavemaster 8600A), pulse counter (SRS SR400), and a
fast ﬂip-ﬂop (NEL NLG4108) as described below. To op-
tically probe the devices, we used a 1550 nm modelocked
ﬁber laser (Calmar Optcom), with a 10 MHz pulse repeti-
tion rate and ≤1 ps pulse duration, that was sent through
an attenuator and polarization controller and then into
the probing station via an optical ﬁber. The devices were
illuminated through a lens attached to the end of the ﬁber
(Oz Optics) and mounted to a second micromanipulator
arm, at an incidence angle of ∼ 15o (from normal to the
sample surface). The focal spot had a measured e−2 ra-
dius of ∼ 8 µm. Figures 2(a)-(d) show output pulses for
wires with total lengths from 5 − 500 µm. The pulses
were asymmetric, and longer in duration for longer or
narrower wires [16].

The microscopic mechanism for the formation and
growth of a resistive hotspot after photon absorption has
been discussed by other authors [17]. Here, we use a sim-
ple phenomenological model, illustrated in Fig. 2(e). A
central feature of this model is the kinetic inductance of
the wire Lk, which can be much larger than the geometric
(magnetic) inductance for very thin ﬁlms [18]. Absorp-
tion of a photon corresponds to the switch opening, at

2

which time the wire acquires a resistance Rn [19]. The
current in the device then begins to decay from its initial
value Ibias with a time constant τfall = Lk/[50Ω + Rn],
towards a ﬁnal value In = Ibias × 50Ω/[50Ω + Rn]. This
decay is interrupted, however, at some “return” current
Iret when the self-heating of the wire, given by I(t)2Rn, is
suﬃciently reduced that the wire becomes fully supercon-
ducting again [18]. The switch in our model then closes,
and the current recovers to its original value with the
time constant τrise = Lk/50Ω [20]. From the observed
asymmetry of the electrical pulses (τfall ≪ τrise) [21], we
conclude that Rn ≫ 50Ω; in this limit, the pulse am-
plitude reduces to: Vpulse ≈ (Ibias − Iret) × 50Ω × Gsig,
where Gsig = 47.8 dB is the measured total gain of our
signal path in the ampliﬁer passband. Since the observed
pulse amplitudes for all devices were well-described by
Vpulse ≈ Ibias × 50Ω × Gsig, we conclude that Iret ≪ Ibias.
The kinetic inductance Lk, which determines the current
recovery time, was measured for each of our devices by
ﬁtting the observed frequency-dependent phase shift of a
reﬂected microwave signal. The dashed red lines shown
in Fig. 2(a)-(d) are the resulting pulse shapes predicted
by our model with no free parameters.

To verify that the large observed inductances were in-
deed primarily kinetic in nature, we compared them to
the corresponding room-temperature resistances R300K.
Kinetic inductance should be proportional to R300K,
since both have the same dependence on wire geometry:
R300K = R300K R ds/A(s) and Lk = Lk R ds/A(s), where
R300K and Lk are the resistivity and kinetic inductivity,
A is the cross-sectional area, and integration is along the
wire. This proportionality is demonstrated in Fig. 2(f)
for 290 diﬀerent devices spanning nearly three decades of
inductance [22].

To determine the detection eﬃciency of our devices, we
measured the fraction of incident photons that resulted
in an output voltage pulse, using a pulse counter [23].
We varied the discriminator threshold of the counter to
identify the voltage range over which the count rate was
observed to be constant, and then set the threshold to
the center of this range. Varying the polarization of the
incident light produced up to a factor of two change in
the count rate, and we chose the setting that produced
the maximum value. The optical intensity was then cho-
sen such that the optical pulse detection probability was
much less than unity. To calibrate the power that the
optical probe delivered to each device, we ﬁrst measured
the total optical power exiting the probe with a power
meter at room temperature. Next, the peak fraction of
this total power subtended by the active area of each de-
vice was individually calibrated at low temperature; we
scanned the optical probe spatially over each device while
recording the count rate, and ﬁt the resulting proﬁles to
the expected convolution of the gaussian-beam and de-
vice shape. The resulting (peak) fractions, from 3 − 80%
for our meander devices, were then used to calculate de-
tection eﬃciencies from the observed count rates. The
4 µm × 6 µm meander device with 100 nm wire width

3

of this mapping is illustrated by the dotted arrows, with
T = 4 ns → I/IC = 0.78 → RDE = 6 × 10−2. The re-
sulting predictions agree well with our data for these two
devices, which have very diﬀerent inductances, support-
ing our model of the reset process in these nanowires.

Fig. 3 has important implications for high-speed ap-
plications of these devices. For the 50% ﬁll device, it
took 8.5 ns for the detection eﬃciency to recover to 90%
of its initial value, and the device will therefore not sup-
port counting rates & 120 MHz near full detection eﬃ-
ciency. Although much higher counting rates can readily
be achieved with lower-inductance devices, reducing the
inductance presently requires either reducing the device
area, increasing the wire width, or increasing the ﬁlm
thickness (these likely explain the GHz counting rates
observed in [10]), any of which would reduce the system
detection eﬃciency.

In summary, we have shown that the reset time of su-
perconducting NbN-nanowire photon counters is limited
by the large kinetic inductance inherent in any thin su-
perconducting ﬁlm. This result implies that present de-
vices with usable active area and high detection eﬃciency
are intrinsically limited to counting rates well below the
GHz regime suggested by early measurements [9], and
that any future attempts to increase the counting rates
accessible to these devices will have to circumvent their
large kinetic inductance. If this can be achieved, the full
potential of these devices may become accessible: with
an intrinsic photoresponse time at 2 K of only ∼30 ps [9],
they could extend photon counting into the tens of GHz
regime characteristic of modern telecommunications.

after a detection event. (a) Filled circles are data obtained
with a 4 µm × 6 µm meander with 100 nm wide wire and a
50% ﬁll factor, open circles indicate a device of the same size
but with a 25% ﬁll factor. Solid curves are the predictions
of our model with no free parameters, obtained as illustrated
in (b) and (c) for the 50% ﬁll device, and based on the mea-
sured inductances (109 nH and 47.1 nH at Ibias = 0 [26]) and
detection eﬃciency vs. Ibias (see text).

and 50% ﬁll factor used in the experiments described be-
low had a measured detection eﬃciency at 1550 nm, with
Ibias = 0.98IC, of 2.8% at 4.2 K, and 5.2% at 2.1 K.

To investigate the time-dependence of the detection
eﬃciency after a detection event, we illuminated the de-
vices with optical pulse pairs [10], and measured the
probability that both pulses were detected, as a func-
tion of the pulse separation. As shown in Fig. 1, we
split the output of our laser into two components, one
of which passed through a 0 - 15 ns optical delay line.
The two components were then recombined to produce
pulse pairs with controllable separation. The output of
the ampliﬁers was sent to a ﬂip-ﬂop, which switches its
digital state every time it is triggered [24]. We then used
the oscilloscope to count only those digital pulses from
the ﬂip-ﬂop having a width nearly equal to the optical
pulse separation, from which we obtained the probabil-
ity that the device detected both optical pulses in a pair.
The result is shown in Fig. 3 for two diﬀerent devices,
with each scaled to its asymptotic value [25].

The solid lines are the predictions of our model for the
two devices, with no free parameters. Figs. 3(b)-(c) il-
lustrate how these curves were generated. For a given
time on the abscissa of (a), we ﬁrst found the instan-
taneous current predicted by our model, based on the
measured inductance [26], as shown in (b). The current
was assumed to start at zero (based on our earlier con-
clusion that Iret ≪ Ibias) [27]. The current at each time
point was then mapped to a relative detection eﬃciency
(RDE) value using a polynomial ﬁt to the measured de-
tection eﬃciency vs. Ibias, shown in (c). An example

[14] Without this isolation, the impedance mismatch of the
ampliﬁer input (VSWR ∼2) caused a suppression of IC
by up to ∼10%, possibly due to back-reﬂected noise
power.

[15] Without a DC block on the outer conductor, IC was sup-
pressed by up to 20%, probably due to ground noise.
[16] The shape and height of photon-induced counts were ob-
served to be identical to those of spontaneously occurring
dark counts, and independent of optical intensity.

[18] See, for example, Introduction to Superconducting Cir-

cuits, A.M. Kadin, Wiley, 1999.

[19] We assumed that the inductance was unaﬀected by the
presence of Rn (i.e. the normal domain covered only a
small fraction of the wire).

[20] In reality, I(t) and R(t) interact dynamically through
Joule heating I(t)2R(t). Our simpliﬁed model approxi-
mates this time-dependent R(t) with a square pulse of
height Rn, lasting from the photon absorption at t = 0
to the time when I(t) = Iret.

[21] The 4 GHz bandwidth of our ampliﬁers obscured the

asymmetry of the pulses from very short wires.

[22] From this data we can extract the magnetic penetration
depth λ, using: Lk ≈ µ0λ2 (valid in the limit λ ≫ t
where t is the ﬁlm thickness [18]). Assuming t = 4 nm,
we obtain from the inductance data: hLki = 360 pH·nm
and hλi = 535 nm (brackets indicate an average over
devices).

[23] The sync output of the laser source was used to trigger
the gate of the counter, which we then set to accept signal
edges only during a 5 ns window centered on the correct
electrical pulse arrival time; this gating allowed us to
exclude virtually all dark counts and afterpulsing from
the observed count rate.

[24] Using a bias T, the DC oﬀset of the ampliﬁed detector sig-
nal was shifted relative to the digital switching threshold
of the ﬂip-ﬂop input such that the latter was just outside
the ampliﬁer noise. This setting gave a digital switching
rate for unpaired 10 MHz optical pulses identical to the
count rate seen on the pulse counter.

[25] In order to acquire detection eﬃciencies over a wide dy-
namic range in a reasonable time, a relatively high opti-
cal intensity was used for these pulse-pair measurements,
corresponding to an individual (isolated) pulse detec-
tion probability Pp ∼0.57 for both devices (or N ∼70
and N ∼220 photons per pulse incident on the ac-
tive areas of the 50% and 25% ﬁll factor devices, re-
spectively). Measured values of Pp were converted to
single-photon detection eﬃciency P1γ using the relation:
Pp = 1 − exp(−N P1γ ).

[26] The inductance was also measured as a function of Ibias,
and was observed to increase by up to 20% close to IC.
This was included numerically in our model.

[27] A small time oﬀset was added to each prediction, to ac-
count for the time it took the current to decay to zero
and the device to return to the superconducting state.
These oﬀsets were ﬁxed at the observed fall times of the
electrical pulses for each device, 330 and 160 ps for the
50% and 25% ﬁll devices, respectively.

The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has a rich
spin physics program aimed at exploring the spin structure of the proton with
polarized proton beams. In addition to the currently accessible channels, heavy
ﬂavor, charged vector boson production and forward mesons are integral parts of
the long-term program. Such measurements require upgrades of the STAR tracking
system and calorimetry. We are presenting an overview of the planned upgrades
and the physics objectives driving them.

1. Introduction and Current Capabilities

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC is the ﬁrst polarized high-energy
proton-proton collider, providing polarized p+p collisions at energies up to
√s = 500 GeV. The focus of the polarized p+p program is to study the spin
structure of the proton1. This program will provide precise measurements
of the polarization of the gluons and of ¯u, ¯d, u, and d quarks. Transverse
spin eﬀects are being explored with transversely polarized beams.

STAR2 is one of the two large detector systems at this accelerator. Its
main tracking detector is a large-volume TPC covering the pseudorapidity
< 1.2, with additional vertex resolution for the reconstruction of
range
< 1), and
strange particles provided by the silicon vertex tracker (SVT,
< 4.0). The barrel
forward tracking by the forward TPCs (FTPCs, 2.5 <
1 < η <
(BEMC) and endcap (EEMC) electromagnetic calorimeter cover
2, additional small acceptance coverage at high rapidity is provided by the
forward pion detector (FPD) in 3.1 < η < 4.2.

Due to its large acceptance tracking and electromagnetic calorimetry,
STAR is uniquely capable of full jet reconstruction at RHIC and very well
suited for measurements of spin asymmetries in inclusive jet, hadron and
photon production as well as in di-jet and γ-jet events. Transverse spin

asymmetries at large xF have been observed in the FPD3. Other measure-
ments, such as large acceptance forward measurements with transversely
polarized beams, studies of the gluon polarization via the double longitudi-
nal spin asymmetry in heavy ﬂavor production and the ﬂavor separation of
quark and anti-quark polarizations via parity violating longitudinal single
spin asymmetries require upgrades of the current detector setup. Figure 1
shows an overview of the planned upgrades within the STAR detector. De-
tails of these upgrades and the physics objectives that drive these upgrades
are discussed in the following.

2. Heavy Flavor Production

In hadronic collisions, the production of heavy quark pairs is dominated by
c¯c, b¯b. The double longitudinal spin asymmetry of
gluon-gluon fusion, gg
heavy quark production thus provides direct access to the gluon polarization
in the proton and is largely independent of the quark helicities1. In heavy-
ion collisions at RHIC, heavy quarks are crucial to investigate the degree
of thermalization in early stages of the collisions and can be used to study
the properties of the created medium. For these studies it is crucial to
identify mesons containing heavy quarks on an event-by-event basis. Since
460 µm for B0, very good vertex resolution is
cτ
needed to identify these particles via displaced vertices. In order to achieve
this, an upgrade of the STAR vertex detectors is planned, consisting of
< 1.0. The Heavy Flavor Tracker HFT is a
two devices, both covering

120 µm for D0 and cτ

lightweight two layer detector based on Active Pixel Sensors (APS)4, with
sensor layers at a radius of 1.5 cm and 5.0 cm, providing a spatial resolution
of better than 10 µm. A fast intermediate device, the Intermediate Silicon
Tracker IST, using three layers of standard back-to-back silicon strips and
pixel detectors, will act as a pointing device from the TPC to the HFT,
and provide high rate capability for high luminosity running. This detector
will replace the existing SVT, which does not have suﬃcient rate capability
for future collider luminosities.

3. Quark Helicities and W Program

From polarized DIS experiments it is known that the ﬂavor-integrated con-
tribution of the quarks to the proton spin is surprisingly small. A ﬂavor
separated study of quark and anti-quark polarizations is thus of fundamen-
tal interest to further investigate this question. At RHIC, a ﬂavor separated
measurement will be carried out via the maximally parity violating produc-
W − reactions. This provides
tion of W bosons in u ¯d
a clean access to the quark polarizations, since the W boson couples only
to left-handed quarks and right-handed anti-quarks. For W production at
large rapidities, the quark is most likely a valence quark from the p trav-
eling in the same direction as the W , while the anti-quark comes from the
sea of the other p.

At STAR, these W s will be detected via their decay W +

e+νe and
W −
e−¯νe. The energy of the outgoing lepton will be measured in the
EEMC at forward rapidity. In order to distinguish between W + and W −,
the identiﬁcation of the charge sign of these high-momentum electrons is
crucial. To achieve this, high resolution tracking in the range 1 < η < 2 is
needed. This will be provided by two detector systems. The Forward Silicon
Tracker FST will consist of up to 4 silicon disks using conventional back-
to-back silicon strip detectors close to the interaction point. The Forward
GEM Tracker FGT will provide additional points with a larger lever arm.
For this second device, several diﬀerent geometries, such as two large-area
tracking layers in front of the EEMC or two detector barrels within the
TPC ﬁeld cage, are currently under investigation. The FGT will be based
on triple-GEM detectors, a technology already successfully applied by the
COMPASS experiment5. For such a large-scale project the commercial
availability of GEM foils is crucial. A collaboration with the company
TechEtch of Plymouth, MA, USA has been established to provide these
foils. First successful tests with detector prototypes have been achieved.

4. Forward Meson Production

A signiﬁcant transverse single spin asymmetry has been observed at large
xF in transversely polarized p+p collisions3. So far the data can not dis-
criminate between diﬀerent models, such as the Sivers and the Collins
eﬀect1. While the Sivers eﬀect leads to an asymmetry in forward jet or
γ production, the Collins mechanism leads to an asymmetry in the forward
jet fragmentation. To distinguish between these two scenarios, the jet axis
in addition to individual mesons has to be measured. This requires a large
acceptance calorimeter in the forward direction. In d+Au collisions, for-
ward meson production is sensitive to the low-x (0.001 < x < 0.02) part of
the gluon distribution in the nucleon, probing possible saturation eﬀects of
gluon densities.

These measurements will be addressed by an upgraded FPD, the For-
ward Meson Spectrometer FMS. It is a Pb-glass calorimeter, covering
2.5 < η < 4.0, giving STAR almost hermetic electromagnetic coverage
1 < η < 4. A ﬁrst phase of this upgrade, the FPD++, was
in the range
installed for the 2006 RHIC run.

5. Summary

STAR is pursuing a challenging spin physics program that will extend well
into the next decade. Future measurements of the gluon polarization via
heavy ﬂavor production, the ﬂavor separation of quark and anti-quark po-
larizations via W production and comprehensive studies of transverse spin
phenomena require upgrades of the tracking system and of the electromag-
netic calorimetry. The planned tracking upgrade includes high resolution
active pixel silicon sensors, standard single-sided silicon strip and pixel de-
tectors and larger area triple-GEM trackers. The upgrade of the forward
Pb-glass calorimeter is already well under way. These upgrades will enable
STAR to make full use of the polarized proton beams available at RHIC.

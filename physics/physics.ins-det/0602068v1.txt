A high vacuum gate valve for skimmed molecular beam experiments is described. It is designed
with a very short extent of only 10 mm along the molecular beam axis to minimize the distance
between the molecular beam source and the experiment to provide the maximum molecular ﬂux
to the experiment. At the same time it provides free space on both sides of the skimmer to not
disturb the supersonic expansion in front of the skimmer, to give optical access to the full distance
between beam source and skimmer, and to allow for placing electrostatic devices very close behind

the skimmer. The gate valve allows to maintain high vacuum conditions (10
imental chamber while the source chamber is brought up to atmospheric pressure for modiﬁcations
or maintenance. The valve can be operated from outside the vacuum chamber while maintaining
vacuum conditions in all chambers.

Molecular beams are an indispensable tool in physical
chemistry and molecular physics. They provide extreme
cooling from ambient or elevated temperatures down to
1 K and are used for a large variety of experiments [1, 2].
In most applications the molecular beam is skimmed a
few cm downstream from the nozzle to reduce the gas-
load in the experimental chamber and to select only the
most intense part of the beam, or to collimate the beam
for reducing the transverse velocity spread.

Small molecules embedded in a supersonic beam can
be focused and state-selected using electrostatic lenses
[3] and they can be decelerated using switched electric
ﬁelds as in a Stark decelerator [4]. In such experiments
it is desirable to accept the largest attainable fraction of
the skimmed beam. This requires, besides other design
criteria, to place the device as close to the skimmer as
possible, as the particle ﬂux falls oﬀ rapidly with dis-
tance. At the same time such devices are operated at
high electric ﬁelds and must be high-voltage conditioned
whenever they have been exposed to air. Therefore, it is
highly desirable to allow for a vacuum separation of the
electrostatic device and the beam source, where changes
to the nozzle for diﬀerent experiments or regular mainte-
nance might be required. Commercial gate valves, how-
ever, cannot be used since they take up too much space.

In this note we present an extremely thin gate valve
design with an extent along the molecular beam axis of
only 10 mm. It allows to keep the experimental cham-
bers under high vacuum (10−8 mbar) while the source
chamber is vented to atmospheric conditions. The valve

is implemented in the source chamber of a new Alter-
nate Gradient decelerator experiment for the decelera-
tion of large (bio-)molecules. This experiment needs dif-
ferent complex molecular beam sources to transfer the
molecules to be studied into the gas phase, for example
a laser desorption setup. These sources require regular
maintenance, as well as optical access to the whole dis-
tance between nozzle and skimmer. Furthermore, it is
important to provide free space around the skimmer in

order to not disturb the supersonic expansion. At the
same time it is desirable to minimize the distance from
the molecular beam source to the decelerator, which is
placed directly behind the skimmer.

Low-proﬁle gate valves have been constructed before,
but only a few are practicable to isolate skimmed molec-
ular beam sources from high vacuum systems [5–7]. They
all have in common that they incorporate the skimmer
into the valve. Marceca et al. [7] simply close the skim-
mer opening from the back with a needle, which in our
experiment would interfere with the decelerator placed
directly behind the skimmer. The design by Stolow [6] is
a simpliﬁed extension of the valve by Chaban et al. [5].
Both designs are, however, two and a half times thicker
than our design and the implementation in a separate
conﬂat ﬂange does not allow for simple optical access di-
rectly at the tip of a short skimmer, as is advantageous
in our experiments.

In our design, the thin gate valve is integrated into a
homebuilt CF 250 ﬂange, that incorporates the gate valve
in the wall separating source and deceleration chamber.
There are several smaller ﬂanges at right angle to pro-

2

vide optical and mechanical access to the source cham-
ber. The CF 250 ﬂange is welded on a commercial CF 250
four-way cross, that is used as the source chamber of our
Alternate Gradient deceleration experiment.

In the explosion drawing of ﬁgure 1 the individual
parts, which are described in the following, are shown.
Figures 2 and 3 show the arrangement of the parts in
the assembled gate valve and in ﬁgure 3 the height of
the valve assembly is depicted. The gate valve is embed-
ded in the CF 250 front ﬂange (8) of the source chamber
of our experimental setup. The ﬂange has two CF 100
ﬂanges (10, 15) at right angles at the left and right for op-
tical and mechanical access to the molecular beam source
(not shown) and the skimmer (2) from the sides, and a
CF 63 (12) ﬂange for access from the top. Integrating
these ﬂanges into the CF 250 ﬂange/wall assembly gives
optical access to the full distance between the nozzle and
the skimmer. We have made use of this to excite CO
molecules to their metastable a3Π-state and to detect
laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) signal from metastable
CO [8] and benzonitrile [9]. The wall separating source
and experimental chamber has a central hole of 38 mm
diameter. This hole is big enough to not disturb a pass-
ing molecular beam and also to provide large enough dis-
tances from the high-voltage electrodes in our decelera-
tor. In a groove milled into the wall on the source-side
a sledge is mounted to provide the valve closure. The
vacuum seal is provided by a 44 mm × 3.5 mm diameter
Viton O-ring (14) mounted in a circular groove of the
wall and pressed between the sledge (16) and the wall.
The sledge itself has a circular groove of 44 mm diameter
in which the skimmer assembly, consisting of an upper

tion feedthroughs. On the left and right are CF 100 ﬂanges

whose operating range for moving the sledge is depicted by

FIG. 3: Cut through the plane depicted in ﬁgure 2. The visi-
ble parts around the center are (bottom to top) the chamber
wall (8), the Viton O-ring (14), the sledge (16), the lower
skimmer mount (3), the skimmer (2), the upper skimmer
mount (1), and the higher part of the wall (8) in the back.
At the sides the shaft holders (4, 18) and the tips of the lever
arms (6, 19) are visible. The dashed arc shows the open view
through the CF 100 ﬂanges (10, 15) of the chamber.

(1) and lower (3) skimmer mount and the skimmer (2)
itself, is mounted. The sledge (16) is moved inside the
groove by a linear motion feedthrough (Huntington L-
2111) mounted on a CF 16 ﬂange (11) into skimming or
sealing position. The traveling distance of the sledge be-
tween the two positions is 49 mm. In ﬁgure 2 the sledge
is shown in skimming position. In this position the skim-
mer position is adjusted onto the molecular beam axis of
the experiment. When closing and opening the gate valve
the skimmer is reproducibly positioned with a precision
of 0.01 mm by two adjustment pins below the sledge mov-
ing inside precisely machined slots (7).

When the sledge is positioned it is pressed against the
O-ring in the wall by two double rocker arm levers (6,
19) positioned symmetrically around the O-ring. A pair
of lever arms is connected by a crossbar at the top to op-
erate two levers simultaneously. Their axes are mounted
close to the chamber wall in shaft holders (4, 18) which
are ﬁxed on the wall. The levers are operated by two lin-
ear motion feedthroughs (Huntington L-2111) mounted
on CF 16 ﬂanges (9, 13). The linear motion feedthroughs
are protected against angular forces by guides assembled
close to the lever arm crossbars (17, front guide not shown
in ﬁgure 1, see ﬁgure 2 for its position). To ﬁx the sledge,
the linear motion feedthroughs push against hardened
steel plates (5) on the back of the lever arm crossbar.
The levers then push the sledge symmetrically against
the O-ring with a 15:1 transmission ratio. A pressure
diﬀerence between the source and deceleration chamber
will automatically provide an additional sealing force on
the sledge. When there is no large pressure diﬀerence
between the two sides of the valve (i. e. both chambers
at high vacuum or both chambers vented) and the lever
arms are released, the sledge can be moved perpendicular
to the molecular beam axis by a 50.8 mm linear motion
vacuum feedthrough (Huntington L-2111) mounted on a
CF 16 ﬂange (11) directly connected to the sledge.

The described gate valve is implemented in a new vac-
uum system used for the Alternate Gradient decelera-
tion [10] of large molecules. After the original assembly
of the chambers we have carefully noted the readings of
all linear motion feedthroughs when the sledge is ﬁxed

3

in operation conditions, i. e. when the skimmer is on the
beam axis, when the sledge is in sealing position, and
while the sledge is moved from one conﬁguration to the
other, i. e. when the lever arms are loose. A skimmer
(Beam Dynamics, model 1, 1 mm oriﬁce) is mounted on
the sledge and carefully aligned onto the molecular beam
axis with the sledge ﬁxed in the corresponding position.
Then the chambers are evacuated and the decelerator is
high-voltage conditioned. When the sledge is moved to
sealing position the source chamber can be vented for
work on the molecular beam source. Under these condi-
tions the pressure in the deceleration chamber stays at
1 × 10−8 mbar, protecting the multi channel plates from
air, and afterward no reconditioning of the high-voltage
electrodes is necessary. This process has been performed
numerous times over the last year and no recognizable
degradation is observed.

The space-eﬀective gate valve presented here is of gen-
eral use for all molecular beam experiments where the
cost of venting the full system is high compared to vent-
ing the source-chamber only. This can be due to air-
sensitive devices, as high-voltage electrodes, sensitive
detectors, or also simply due to vacuum requirements,
where venting of the full experiment requires long pump-
ing times due to large volumes or high vacuum require-
ments in the experimental chambers. The presented gate
valve is especially useful for applications that require a
short distance between the nozzle and the experimental
device, for example hexapole focusing or Stark decelera-
tion of molecular beams. It is invaluable when sources are
used that require regular maintenance or cleaning, i. e.
laser desorption or ablation sources, discharge sources,
pyrolysis sources, or sources that are simply heated or
cooled to extreme temperatures.

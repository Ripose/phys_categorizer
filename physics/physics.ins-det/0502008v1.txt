Abstract

A Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) is being developed for the PHENIX experiment at RHIC.
It consists of a ˇCerenkov radiator operated with pure CF4 directly coupled in a windowless
conﬁguration to a triple-GEM detector element with a CsI photocathode and pad readout.
The HBD operates in the bandwidth 6-11.5 eV (110-200 nm). We studied the detector re-
sponse to minimum ionizing particles and to electrons. We present measurements of the CsI
quantum eﬃciency, which are in very good agreement with previously published results over
the bandwidth 6-8.3 eV and extend them up to 10.3 eV. Discharge probability and aging
studies of the GEMs and the CsI photocathode in pure CF4 are presented.

1 Introduction

We describe the operation and performance of a Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) which
is being developed as an upgrade of the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) at BNL. The main purpose of the HBD is to allow the measurement

of low-mass (me+e−
ions collisions at energies up to √sN N = 200 GeV. Low-mass dileptons are a powerful
observable in the quest for the quark-gluon plasma and in particular for the restoration
of chiral symmetry expected to take place in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. The
results of the CERES experiment [1] at CERN support the unique physics potential
of this probe. The strong enhancement of low-mass pairs observed in nuclear collisions
could only be explained by invoking the ππ annihilation channel π+π−
e+e−
with an in-medium modiﬁcation of the intermediate ρ meson which could be linked to
the restoration of chiral symmetry [2].

With its excellent mass resolution, the PHENIX detector has the potential to perform
precision spectroscopy of the ρ, ω, and φ mesons in addition to the pair continuum
measurement. The observation of mass shifts of the ρ, ω, and φ mesons would provide
direct evidence for the scenarios invoking the restoration of chiral symmetry. How-
ever, the present conﬁguration of the PHENIX detector is severely limited in the e+e−
low-mass region. The detector lacks the capability to recognize and reject the over-
whelming yield of combinatorial background pairs, i.e. uncorrelated pairs formed by
tracks from unrecognized conversions and π0 Dalitz decays. In the mass range me+e−
0.3 - 0.5 GeV/c2 the present signal to background ratio is S/B

An upgrade of the PHENIX detector is therefore necessary for this measurement. The
present work is focussed on the development of an HBD which is the key element for
such an upgrade. The HBD consists of a ˇCerenkov radiator, operated with pure CF4
and directly coupled to a triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [3] photon detector
element [4,5]. The concept is described in detail in Section 2.

In a recent publication [4] we have demonstrated the successful operation of a triple-
GEM detector in pure CF4. In particular we have shown that the detector operates in a
stable manner at gains up to 104 with and without a reﬂective CsI photocathode evap-
orated on the upper face of the top GEM. In the present paper, we concentrate on the
hadron blindness properties and performance of the HBD. We present results obtained
with a Hg UV lamp, a 55Fe X-ray source and an 241Am alpha source. We also present
results from beam tests carried out at KEK using 1 GeV/c pions. Section 3 describes the
various setups and conditions under which the measurements were performed. Section 4
presents measurements of the detector response to photoelectrons, alpha particles and
pions as a function of the drift ﬁeld. In Section 5, we present our measurements of the
CsI quantum eﬃciency over the bandwidth 6-10.3 eV. The discharge probabilities of
HV-segmented GEM foils are discussed in Section 6 and aging studies of the GEM foils
and the CsI photocathode in pure CF4 atmosphere are presented in Section 7. A short
summary and conclusions are presented at the end of the paper, in Section 8.

2 The HBD concept.

The PHENIX detector was designed anticipating that the measurement of low-mass
pairs would be feasible with an appropriate upgrade. In particular, provision was made

2

∼

for the installation of an inner coil which would create an almost ﬁeld-free region close
to the vertex, extending out to
50-60 cm in the radial direction. In addition to this
coil, the second major element of the upgrade is an HBD located in this ﬁeld free region.
The main task of the HBD is to recognize and reject conversions and πo Dalitz decay
pairs by exploiting their small opening angle. Its size is constrained by the available
space starting outside the beam pipe (at r
5 cm) and ending before the inner coil (at
r
55 cm). Fig. 1 shows the layout of the inner part of the PHENIX detector together
∼
with the location of the coils and the proposed HBD.

∼

and the second coil.

The system speciﬁcations of the HBD have been extensively studied in Monte Carlo
simulations. [6]. A reduction of the combinatorial background originating from conver-
sions and π0 Dalitz decays of at least two orders of magnitude can be achieved with
a detector that provides electron identiﬁcation with a very high eﬃciency, of at least
90%. This also implies a double (electron) hit recognition at a comparable level. On the
other hand, a moderate π rejection factor of
100 is suﬃcient. Possible realizations of
the HBD detector were considered in the study. After careful consideration of relevant
options for the key elements (gases, detector conﬁguration and readout chambers), the
choice that emerged is a windowless ˇCerenkov detector, operated with pure CF4 in
a proximity focus conﬁguration, with a CsI photocathode and a triple-GEM detector
element with pad readout.

∼

Since a mirror-type RICH detector in the center of PHENIX is very diﬃcult or nearly
impossible to implement, we consider a scheme without mirror and without window
in which the ˇCerenkov light from particles passing through the radiator is directly
collected on a CsI photosensitive cathode plane, forming a circular blob image rather
than a ring as in a RICH detector. The choice of CF4 both as radiator and detector
gas in a windowless geometry results in a very large bandwidth (from
6 eV given
11.5 eV given by the CF4 cut-oﬀ) and consequently
by the threshold of the CsI to

in a very large ﬁgure of merit N0 and a very large number of photoelectrons Npe that
was estimated to be of the order of 40 in a 50 cm long radiator [6]. This large number
of photoelectrons ensures a very high electron eﬃciency, and more importantly, it is
crucial for achieving a double-hit recognition larger than 90%.

Another important advantage of the present design using GEMs is that it allows the
use of a reﬂective photocathode (i.e. the top face of the ﬁrst GEM is coated with
a thin layer of CsI and the photoelectrons are pulled into the holes of the GEM by
their strong electric ﬁeld) and consequently the photocathode is totally screened from
photons produced in the avalanche process.

The present readout scheme foresees the detection of the ˇCerenkov photoelectrons in a
10 cm2) such
pad plane with hexagonal pads of size slightly smaller than the blob size (
that the probability of a single pad hit by an electron entering the HBD is negligibly
small. This results in a low granularity detector. In addition, since the photoelectrons
produced by a single electron will be distributed between at most three pads, one can
expect a primary charge of at least 10 electrons/pad, allowing operation of the detector
at a relatively moderate gain of a few times 103.

GEMs produced at CERN were used in all measurements. The GEMs were made of
50 µm kapton foils with 5 µm thick copper layers, 60-80 µm diameter holes and 140 µm
100 mm2. These two types

100 mm2 each)
side of some of the large GEMs was divided into four segments (25
and will be referred to in the text as ”segmented”. 3 GEMs were assembled into one
stack with G10 frames as shown in Fig. 2. The distance between the drift mesh and the
top GEM (GEM1), the distance between GEMs and the distance between the bottom
GEM (GEM3) and the printed circuit board (PCB) were all equal to 1.5 mm. The

PCB consisted of 9 square pads of size 33

In most tests, the high voltage to the GEMs and mesh was supplied by a single HV
power supply through a three-branch resistive chain (Fig. 2). In this scheme three
independent resistive dividers provide the voltage to the top and bottom planes of each
GEM. When a discharge occurs in one GEM the voltage across the other GEMs drops
only slightly unlike the case of a single-branch resistive divider. In the latter case the
voltages across other GEMs increase and can cause multiple discharges and damage the
GEMs. The resistors R in the chain were 5.6 MΩ, R1 and R2 were 1.2 MΩ. For the
segmented GEMs, the resistors R2 were connected directly to each segment and were
located inside the detector box. To ensure almost 100% electron collection eﬃciency
to the PCB, the induction ﬁeld EI is set to twice the transfer ﬁeld ET [4]. For the
measurements where the drift ﬁeld was varied, two HV power supplies were used, one
for the mesh and one for the three GEMs.

sources were used for measurements with UV-photons, X-rays and α-particles, respectively.

For the measurements with the reﬂective CsI photocathode GEM1 was prepared with
a gold-coated surface to prevent chemical interaction with cupper. Below the gold layer
a thin Ni layer was deposited in order to provide good adhesion of the gold layer.
The gold-coated GEMs were also produced at CERN and the deposition of the CsI

the reﬂective photocathode the drift ﬁeld is set to be equal to zero or even slightly
reversed in order to collect only the photo-electrons from the CsI layer and to repel the
ionization of minimum ionizing particles. For these measurements the corresponding
contact of the resistive chain was disconnected and an independent power supply was
used for the mesh.

∼

The GEMs, PCB and drift mesh were mounted inside a stainless steel box which could
be pumped down to 10−6 Torr and was connected to inlet and outlet gas lines to
allow gas ﬂushing. The setup contained also devices for the precise measurements of
temperature, pressure and water content down to the ppm level. For the tests with
55Fe X-rays, the radioactive source was positioned on a moving arm inside the box at
40 mm from the mesh. The 55Fe source could be moved out of the
a distance of
sensitive volume. The total rate of X-rays was kept at the level of 1 kHz. The 5.9 keV
photons from 55Fe release 110 electrons in CF4 (54 eV per electron-ion pair). For the
measurements of the discharge limits with heavily ionizing particles we used an 241Am
source which emits 5.5 MeV alpha-particles. The source was attached to a moving
1mm from the mesh and was strongly
arm that could be inserted at a distance of
collimated in order to provide high energy deposition and small energy dispersion in
the sensitive gap. The rate of alpha-particles was

100 Hz.

The measurements with the CsI reﬂective photocathode were performed with a Hg-
lamp through a UV-transparent CaF2 window mounted on the cover of the detector
box. The lamp was positioned above the window with an absorber which reduced the
UV ﬂux by about a factor of 1000 in order to prevent damage to the photocathode.
The illuminated area of the detector was about 1 cm2. In this geometry the measured
photo-electron current was about 2

The study of the gain limits required a reliable way to monitor discharges in the triple-
GEM assembly via the resistive chain. The chain was biased by a CAEN-126 HV-power
supply. This module includes protection against over-current with a precision of 0.1 µA.
The current in the resistive chain was in the range between 250 and 300 µA and the
protection threshold was always kept at 1 µA above the normal value. This was enough
to cause a trip when a discharge occurred in a GEM. The trip signal was reset after
1 second and was also counted by a scaler.

The beam test at KEK was done with a 1 GeV/c secondary beam of negative particles
(mainly pions) containing a few percent of electrons. The setup consisted of two gas
ˇCerenkov counters (GCC), a set of scintillation counters (S1, S2 and S3), the HBD and
a lead glass calorimeter (PbGl). The HBD consisted of a 50 cm long radiator directly
coupled to the detector box and setup described above. The detector was operated

4 Detector response as function of the drift ﬁeld.

A hadron blind detector is characterized by its insensitivity to hadrons, i.e. by a large
hadron rejection factor while keeping a high detection eﬃciency for electrons. The
hadron blindness property of the proposed detector is achieved by reversing the di-
rection of the drift ﬁeld ED thereby pushing most of the ionization charges towards the
mesh. With this negative drift-ﬁeld conﬁguration, photoelectrons released from the CsI
photocathode surface are still eﬀectively collected into the GEM holes due to the strong
electric ﬁeld inside the holes which is typically of the order of 100 kV/cm.

In order to characterize and quantify both the hadron rejection factor and the photo-
electron detection eﬃciency, we performed systematic measurements as a function of
the drift ﬁeld with alpha particles, pions of 1 GeV/c and UV photons. Details of these
measurements and the results are presented in this section.

4.1 Detector response to minimum ionizing particles and alpha particles.

Fig. 3 shows the pulse-height distribution, after pedestal subtraction, measured at KEK
with 1 GeV/c pions for various values of ED. The signal is expressed in terms of the
primary ionization charge, using the 55Fe spectrum measured under identical conditions.
For ED = +1 kV/cm, the measured mean amplitude is
18 e corresponding to a
primary ionization of 120 charges/cm or 54 eV/ion-pair assuming an energy loss of
dE/dx = 7 keV/cm [7]. The spectrum is well reproduced by a Landau distribution
characteristic of the energy loss of a minimum ionizing particle (mip).

ED in the gap between the mesh and the upper GEM. The solid lines in the upper left and
bottom right panels represent ﬁts to a Landau distribution of the measured spectra. The insert
in the bottom right panel is an expanded view of the low signal part of that panel.

The spectrum remains practically unchanged as long as ED is positive as shown for
two cases in the upper panels of Fig. 3. As soon as ED is reversed, i.e set to negative
values, there is a sharp drop in the pulse height as the primary charges get repelled
towards the mesh. The mean amplitude drops to
10% of its value for a positive ﬁeld.
This value results from the collection of ionization charges (i) from a thin layer above
the ﬁrst GEM surface and (ii) from the entire ﬁrst transfer gap which are subject to a
two-stage ampliﬁcation. At a gain of 104, the former is estimated to be a factor of

The mean amplitude vs. ED is shown in Fig. 4. The amplitude decreases sharply
when the polarity of the drift ﬁeld is switched and this occurs within a ∆ED range
of
0.1 kV/cm. The ﬁgure shows also the results of similar measurements performed
with alpha particles. The results are practically identical in both cases. The small dif-
ference in the values of the ﬁeld at the onset of the signal drop is well within the
uncertainties of the absolute high-voltage values given the power supplies used in the
two measurements.

The hadron rejection factor derived from the pion spectra measured at negative drift
ﬁelds is shown in Fig. 5. The rejection is limited by the long Landau tail and depends
on the amplitude threshold that can safely be applied without compromising the elec-
tron collection eﬃciency. Rejection factors of the order of 50 can be achieved with an
amplitude threshold of
10 e. A much higher rejection factor is achieved by combining
the amplitude response with the hit size. As mentioned above, the pad readout con-
sists of hexagonal pads with a size somewhat smaller than the Cherenkov blob size.
Under these conditions charged particles will produce single pad hits whereas electrons
will most probably produce multiple-pad hits thereby providing an additional powerful
handle on the charged particle rejection.

4.2 Detector response to photoelectrons.

Measurements as a function of the drift ﬁeld to determine the electron detection ef-
ﬁciency were performed with UV-photons from a Hg lamp irradiating the CsI photo-
cathode through the UV-transparent CaF2 window. We measured the photo-current
at the PCB for values of the HV accross the GEMs varying from 442 to 506 V which

in Fig. 6. The various measurements have been normalized to 1 at ED=0 kV/cm to

measurements. The relative detection eﬃciency is practically independent of the ﬁeld

across the GEMs. The eﬃciency slightly increases as the positive drift ﬁeld decreases,
reaching a maximum at 0 kV/cm. A mild decrease in the current is then observed as
the drift ﬁeld becomes more and more negative demonstrating that the detection eﬃ-
ciency of the photoelectrons remains very high even at negative drift ﬁelds of 1 kV/cm.

Combining the results of Figs. 4 and 6 one sees that the best performance is achieved
by applying a slightly negative ﬁeld in the drift gap. The results presented here are
consistent with those of ref. [8,9] though with diﬀerent gases and voltages across the
GEMs.

5 CsI Quantum Eﬃciency

The absolute quantum eﬃciency (QE) of the CsI photocathode was measured by a large
number of groups (see [9], [10] for comprehensive reviews and further references). Most
of the measurements are in reasonable agreement with each other. However, none of
these measurements were performed at wavelengths below 150 nm (or a photon energy
above 8.3 eV). Since CF4 is transparent up to 11.5 eV it was important to extend the
measurements of the absolute QE of CsI as much as possible.

Fig. 7. Schematic view of the experimental setup for measuring the quantum eﬃciency of the
CsI layer.

The determination of the absolute QE requires an absolutely calibrated light source,
which is not available in most laboratories. Therefore, usually a relative method is used,
namely the recording of the sample response relative to a ”known” reference. In our
measurements we used as a reference a calibrated photomultiplier tube.

The experimental setup used for the determination of the absolute quantum eﬃciency of
the CsI layer is shown in Fig. 7. It includes a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) monochromator
(Jobin Yvon H20, 115-500 nm) equipped with a deuterium lamp (Hamamatsu L7293,
115-320 nm), coupled via a LiF window (cut-oﬀ at 105 nm) to a detector box. The
monochromator box also includes a LiF beam splitter which splits the beam between
the photomultiplier PMT-0 (Hamamatsu R1460) and the detector box. PMT-0 serves
as a normalization to monitor the deuterium lamp intensity. The detector box included
an absolutely calibrated photomultiplier tube PMT (Hamamatsu R6836) on one side
3 cm2) GEM foil on which a 2500 ˚A
and on the other side a box containing a small (3
layer of CsI was evaporated. PMT was operated in photodiode mode (gain=1). Above
the foil and at a distance of 1.5 mm from it was a mesh electrode which was at a positive
voltage with respect to the foil. The detector box also had a UV mirror which served to
deﬂect the beam alternatively to the CsI layer and to the PMT. Collimators of 8 mm
diameter were placed in front of the mesh and PMT, making sure that the solid angle
seen by the photomultiplier and the CsI layer was exactly the same. By rotating the

×

UV-mirror the current was measured in turn over the whole wavelength range on both
devices.

The current of the CsI and photomultiplier PMT as measured in vacuum is shown in
Fig. 8. The measurements were done over the wavelength range of 120 - 200 nm (E =
6.2 - 10.3 eV). The measurements were repeated with CF4 gas at atmospheric pressure.
The total path in CF4 was 23 cm.

Fig. 9. Absolute quantum eﬃciency of CsI in vacuum and CF4 over the bandwidth 6.2 - 10.3
eV.

HBD extends up to the CF4 cut-oﬀ which is at 11.5 eV. Extrapolating the data of Fig. 9
to 11.5 eV under the assumption of a linear dependence of the quantum eﬃciency vs.
photon energy gives a ﬁgure of merit N0= 822 cm−1 or an average quantum eﬃciency
of 55% in CF4. For a 50 cm long radiator this N0 value would correspond to
35
photoelectrons (p.e.) (after taking into account the losses due to the entrance mesh and
the holes of the top GEM). This unprecedented value of N0 is a direct consequence of
the large bandwidth of CF4 in the present windowless conﬁguration 3 .

6 Discharge probability and saturation eﬀect.

Stability of operation and absence of discharges in the presence of heavily ionizing par-
ticles is crucial for the operation of the HBD. The 241Am source was used to simulate
heavily ionizing particles under laboratory conditions. In our earlier paper [4] the dis-
charge probability was measured in small GEMs. In Ar/CO2 it was found to increase
104 when the total charge approached the Raether limit of
sharply at a gas gain of
108 [11] whereas in CF4 no such sharp increase was found. On the contrary the onset of
the discharges was spread over a broad gain range (see Fig. 4 in [4]). The robustness of
CF4 against discharges compared to Ar/CO2 was attributed to the charge saturation
107 e (i.e. below the Raether limit). However, all
observed in CF4 at the level of 2
30 mm2 GEMs. Similar measurements on
the measurements in CF4 were done with 30
large GEMs could not be done since the ﬁrst spark usually destroyed one of the GEMs
due to the large energy stored in the large capacitance.

3 A direct measurement of N0 during the beam test at KEK was not possible due to the large
UV absorption in the available gas system. We observed only 6-10 p.e. per electron trigger.
This number is however consistent with the expected number of
35 p.e. after correcting it
for the measured absorption in the gas.

100 mm2 GEMs to repeat the discharge
In the present work we used HV segmented 100
probability studies and revisit the charge saturation eﬀect in a more careful way. In par-
ticular, at high values of the total charge, when the pre-ampliﬁer is close to saturation,
the output signal is already reduced compared to its real value. We therefore repeated
the measurements of the total charge produced by alpha-particles as a function of the
GEM voltage without any pre-ampliﬁer, with the central pad directly connected to the
1 MΩ input of an oscilloscope through a 1m coaxial cable. In this case the pulse height
observed at the scope is determined by the ratio of the charge induced in the pad and
the total capacitance of the pad including the capacitance of the cable. Examples of the
pulses and pulse-height distributions measured with this method are shown in Fig. 10.
In the ﬁgures the screen images of the oscilloscope are shown together with the pulse
height distribution on the left side of the ﬁgures. The three ﬁgures correspond to 3 dif-
ferent voltages on the GEMs. The risetime of the pulses is determined by the induction
of charge by the moving electrons and the decay time is determined by the RC constant
of the readout chain, i.e. the product of the pad capacitance and the impedance of the
scope (1 MΩ). In Fig. 11 we compare the signal measured without pre-ampliﬁer at the
1 MΩ input of the oscilloscope and the measurement with pre-ampliﬁer. Both measure-
ments were performed under identical conditions and for this purpose the pre-ampliﬁer
was calibrated in units of input charge. In order to obtain the relation beween the signal
measured without pre-ampliﬁer and the input charge the results were normalized in the
range ∆VGEM = 420 - 440 V where both measurements could be performed and the
ampliﬁer was still far from saturation. At ∆VGEM > 490 V the pulse-height resolution
deteriorates considerably and we therefore plot the mean value (instead of the peak
value) of the pulse-height distribution.

Fig. 10 was obtained at ∆VGEM = 506 V where according to Fig. 11 the saturation
eﬀect is already quite pronounced (the mean signal is suppressed by almost a factor of
3 with respect to the expected exponential behaviour) establishing a clear correlation
between the saturation eﬀect and the deterioration of the pulse height resolution.

×

As already mentioned the saturation of the signal strongly suppresses the probabil-
ity of the discharges provoked by heavily ionizing particles. This suppression was also
observed in the measurements of the discharge limits performed with the segmented
large triple-GEM detector. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig. 12.
Two measurements are presented in the ﬁgure, the measurement in the presence of
alpha-particles and the measurement without alpha-particles. In both cases the gain
was monitored at each voltage with the 55Fe source. The dependence of the gain on
voltage is presented in the ﬁgure together with the spark frequency as a function of
the GEM voltage. The duration of each measurement was
2000 s, i.e. the maximum

number of sparks counted in the highest point was about 20. The present detector

showed negligible spark probability at gains up to
that the discharge limit does not depend on the presence of alpha-particles in the sen-
sitive volume of the detector. Rather it seems that only local defects in the GEMs are
responsible for the discharges and limit the gain of the device.

7 Aging studies.

In the present HBD two possible sources of long term detector degradation under irradi-
ation can be identiﬁed: aging of the CsI photocathode due to ion back-ﬂow and possible
chemical reactions with active radicals formed in electron-ion avalanches in CF4, and
aging of the GEMs due to etching of metal or insulator surfaces and/or polymerization
of pollutants from avalanches in CF4 at the metal or insulator surfaces. Both processes
depend on the total charge ﬂowing through the detector which is the product of the
photo-electron current collected into the holes of the ﬁrst GEM and the total gain of
the triple-GEM system.

104 we conservatively estimate the total charge ﬂow
Assuming operation at a gain of
through the HBD in normal PHENIX operation to be 10-20 µC/cm2/year. Thus we
decided to perform an aging test of the detector module up to an accumulated total
charge of 100 to 200 µC/cm2 to represent approximately ten years of HBD operation
in PHENIX.

∼

The aging tests were performed so as to decouple the degradation of the photocathode
from the deterioration of GEMs. We used two sources of radiation: The UV Hg-lamp
and the 55Fe X-ray source. The UV lamp was used for continuous irradiation of the
detector under test and the current to the PCB was monitored. Every few hours the
UV irradiation was stopped and the 55Fe source was inserted into the detector for a
short gain monitoring allowing to assess the gain stability of the triple-GEM. Once
the gain is known we can then infer the stability of the CsI photocathode. During UV
irradiation the electric ﬁeld in the drift gap was kept at zero whereas during the X-ray

The second aging test was performed with a large segmented triple-GEM set. This
test was done at a lower rate than the ﬁrst one in that the detector accumulated a

panel of Fig. 13, the gain variations during the test did not exceed 20% and during
the second half of the test they were even
5%. In the ﬁrst 10 hours of irradiation
the gain derived from UV irradiation and the one determined from the measurements
with the 55Fe source diﬀered by
20%. This result indicates that the photocathode
eﬃciency or collection eﬃciency of the photo-electrons into the ﬁrst GEM holes was
higher during that period. After the ﬁrst 10 hours both gains converged to the same
value and followed a very similar dependence. The performance of both small and large
GEM sets during the initial phases of the aging tests including the gradual increase of
the gain in the second test is not yet understood 4 . However as a result of these tests
we conclude that both the photocathode eﬃciency and the GEM gain do not exhibit
any dramatic change which can be interpreted as aging degradation of the detector.

8 Summary and conclusions

An HBD is being proposed for an upgrade of the PHENIX experiment at RHIC. The
HBD is a windowless ˇCerenkov detector, operated with pure CF4 in a proximity focus
conﬁguration. The detector consists of a 50 cm long radiator directly coupled to a triple-
GEM detector which has a CsI photocathode evaporated on the top face of the ﬁrst
GEM foil and a pad readout at the bottom of the GEM stack. We have studied the basic
parameters which determine the HBD performance. In particular, we have presented
results on the device response to mip’s and to electrons. Large hadron rejection factors,
well in excess of 100, can be achieved while preserving an electron detection eﬃciency
larger than 90%. Extrapolating the quantum eﬃciency of CsI from the measured range
6-10.3 eV to the expected operational bandwidth of the device (6-11.5 eV) gives a ﬁgure
of merit N0=822 cm−1 and a very large number of photoelectrons of
36 over a 50
cm long radiator. The charge saturation eﬀect occurring in CF4 when the total charge
107 e makes the HBD relatively robust against discharges.
in the avalanche reaches 4
Our measurements show that the limit of stability is actually dictated by the quality
of the GEM foils rather than by the presence of highly ionizing particles. Very stable
operation can be achieved at gains up to 104 with 10
10 cm2 GEMs segmented into
four HV segments 5 . Aging studies of the GEM foils as well as the CsI photocathode
reveal that there is no signiﬁcant deterioration of the detector for irradiation levels
corresponding to
10 years of normal PHENIX operation at RHIC. Recently, a test
was carried out of a triple-GEM detector operated with pure CF4 and located inside
the PHENIX central arm spectrometer at a distance of 50 cm from the collision point

over periods of time ranging from a few hours to a few days before stable operation was
reached. The origin of these instabilities is unclear and will be the subject of further studies.

no discharges or gain instabilities. The measurements presented here and the beam test
results demonstrate the validity of the proposed HBD concept and pave the way for the
incorporation of such a detector in the PHENIX experiment.

The multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) is a newly developed photodetector with an excellent photon counting
capability. It also has many attractive features such as small size, high gain, low operation voltage and power
consumption, and capability of operating in magnetic ﬁelds and in room temperature. The basic performance of
samples has been measured. A gain of ∼106 is achieved with a noise rate less than 1 MHz with 1 p.e. threshold,
and cross-talk probability of less than 30% at room temperature. The photon detection eﬃciency for green
light is twice or more that of the photomultiplier tubes. It is found that the basic performance of the MPPC is
satisfactory for use in real experiments.

1. MULTI-PIXEL PHOTON COUNTERS

The multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) is a new
photodetector developed by Hamamatsu Photonics,
Japan [1]. An MPPC consists of many (100 to >1000)
small avalanche photodiodes (APDs) in an area of typ-
ically 1 mm2. Figure 1 shows a picture of an MPPC
with 100 pixels.

Each APD micropixel independently works in lim-
ited Geiger mode with an applied voltage a few volts
above the breakdown voltage (Vbd). When a photo-
electron is produced, it induces a Geiger avalanche.
The avalanche is passively quenched by a resistor in-
tegral to each pixel. The output charge Q from a
single pixel is independent of the number of produced
photoelectrons within the pixel, and can be written as
Q = C(V − Vbd),

where V is the applied voltage and C is the capaci-
tance of the pixel. Combining the output from all the
pixels, the total charge from an MPPC is quantized
to multiples of Q and proportional to the number of
pixels that underwent Geiger discharge (“ﬁred ”). The
number of ﬁred pixels is proportional to the number
of injected photons if the number of photons is small
compared to the total number of pixels. Thus, the
MPPC has an excellent photon counting capability.

device in a package. Right: close-up view of APD
micropixels.

For the MPPC, the operation voltage V is a few
volts above the breakdown voltage and well below
100 V. The pixel capacitance C is on the order of
10–100 fF, giving a gain of 105–106. These features
enable us to read out the signal from the MPPC with
simple electronics. In addition, because the thickness
of the ampliﬁcation region is a few µm, it is insensitive
to an applied magnetic ﬁeld and the response is fast.
Because of these great advantages, several particle
physics experiments are going to use the MPPC. The
T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka) long baseline neutrino oscil-
lation experiment [2], which is now under construc-
tion and will start in 2009, has chosen the MPPC as
one of the baseline photosensors for the near neutrino
detector complex. Calorimeters for the International
Linear Collider are another project that is considering
use of the MPPC [3]. In these experiments, MPPCs
will be used to detect photons from plastic scintilla-

tors guided by wavelength-shifting ﬁbers. With larger
area devices or a light collection system, the MPPC
may be used for the aerogel-RICH particle identiﬁca-
tion system in a B-factory upgrade [4]. The features
of MPPCs are suitable not only for particle physics
experiments but for much wider applications such as
astrophysics, space science, material science, or med-
ical instruments.

The MPPC is a newly developed device and its per-
formance is rapidly improving. In this report, the lat-
est status of the development and future prospects are
presented.

We have tested two types of the latest samples of
MPPCs produced by Hamamatsu Photonics. The dif-
ference between them is the number of pixels—one has
100 pixels with a 100 µm pitch and the other has 400
pixels with a 50 µm pitch. A device with a 25 µm
pitch and 1600 pixels is also being tested, although
not reported here. The main characteristics of the
tested samples are summarized in Table I. The time
response of the MPPC depends on the quenching re-
sistor and capacitance of each pixel. The numbers
shown in Table I are the typical values.

3. BASIC PERFORMANCE

The basic performance of the MPPC is measured
with light from an LED. All results shown in this sec-
tion are for a sample 400 pixel device.

3.1. Raw signal

Figure 2(a) shows the raw signal from an MPPC
taken with an oscilloscope. The MPPC is illuminated
by pulsed light from an LED at low intensity and
the oscilloscope is triggered in synch with the LED
pulse. The responses for multiple triggers are overlaid
in the ﬁgure. One can see excellently separated sig-
nals corresponding to one, two, and three ﬁred pixels.
Figure 2(b) shows the output charge read out by an

0126

analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The charge corre-
sponding to diﬀerent numbers of ﬁred pixels is again
well separated (or quantized) as peaks in the ADC
distribution at equal intervals. This indicates that
the gain of each micropixel is uniform in an MPPC.
These observations demonstrate the excellent photon
counting capability of the MPPC.

The gain is measured by illuminating an MPPC
with light from an LED. From the number of ADC
counts between a well-separated pedestal and the peak
corresponding to a single ﬁred pixel (Fig. 2(b)), we de-
rive the charge corresponding to a single ﬁred pixel,
Q. The gain is deﬁned as Q divided by the charge
of an electron. Figure 3 shows the measured gain as
a function of the applied voltage. The measurement
is performed inside a temperature-controlled chamber
and the data at 15, 20, and 25◦C are shown. The
measured gain is 3×105–1.2×106 and linearly depends
on the applied voltage as expected. The breakdown

voltage decreases with lower temperature, resulting in
larger gain at a ﬁxed applied voltage. The tempera-
ture coeﬃcient is about −3%/◦C.

Blue, green, and red points correspond to data at 15, 20,
and 25◦C, respectively. Rectangular and triangle points
represent the rate with thresholds of 0.5 and 1.5 p.e.,
respectively.

The noise rate is measured by counting the rate
above a threshold without external light input. The
results at 15, 20, and 25◦C are shown in Fig. 4. The
horizontal axis in Fig. 4 shows the diﬀerence between
the applied voltage and the breakdown voltage Vbd.
The breakdown voltage is derived by linearly extrap-
olating the gain-voltage curve in Fig. 3 to the point
where the gain becomes zero. With a threshold equiv-
alent to 0.5 photoelectrons (p.e.)1, the noise rate is
0.5–1 MHz. However, it decreases by about or more
than an order of magnitude if the threshold is set to
1.5 p.e. The noise rate decreases as the temperature
becomes lower. The temperature coeﬃcient of noise
rate at 0.5 p.e. threshold is −7%/◦C. These obser-
vations imply that the dominant component of the
noise is due to the discharge of single pixels induced
by thermally generated carriers.

We have tested three samples of MPPCs of the same
type. Although the number of the tested devices is
limited, we ﬁnd that the device-by-device variation of
the characteristics is small: with an applied voltage
of 68.8 V, the maximum diﬀerence in the gain is less
than 3%, while that of the noise rate is about 7%.
We plan to test much larger numbers of devices in the
near future.

1Here, “p.e.” means the number of detected photoelectrons,
and is assumed to be the same as the number of ﬁred pixels
when those numbers are small.

The cross-talk between neighboring micropixels
has been observed. The origin of the cross-talk
is presumed to be optical photons emitted during
avalanche [5] which enter neighboring micropixels and
trigger another Geiger discharge.

The probability of causing cross-talk is estimated
from the fraction of events with more than one p.e. to
that with one p.e. in randomly triggered events with-
out external light. We assume that the events with
more than one p.e. are caused by the cross-talk from
the original Geiger discharge in a single pixel. The
eﬀect from accidental coincidence of two independent
discharges is estimated from the fraction of pedestal
events, assuming a Poisson distribution for the origi-
nal Geiger discharge, and has been subtracted.

Figure 5 shows the cross-talk probability as a func-
tion of the applied voltage above Vbd. The cross-talk
probability is found to be almost independent of the
temperature. However, it depends on the applied volt-
age. The measured cross-talk probability is at an ac-
ceptable level for certain applications (e.g.
for the
T2K neutrino experiment). However, for applications
that require good linearity with wide dynamic range
(e.g.
ILC calorimeters), this may limit the perfor-
mance of the device, and improvement may be neces-
sary.

3.4. Photon detection efﬁciency

The photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) is an impor-
tant parameter for the performance of the MPPC. For
an MPPC, the PDE is written as a product of three
eﬀects:

PDE = εgeom × QE × εGeiger.

4

SNIC Symposium, Stanford, California - 3-6 April, 2006

The geometrical eﬃciency εgeom represents the frac-
tion of active area in a micropixel.
It depends on
the design and the size of a pixel, but is about 0.5
for current samples. The quantum eﬃciency of the
APD, QE, depends on the wavelength of photon and
is typically 0.7–0.8 in the range of current interest.
The probability of inducing a Geiger discharge when
a photoelectron is generated, εGeiger, depends on the
applied voltage.

Figure 7 shows the results of the measurement at
15◦C. The PDE of the MPPC for green light is about
or more than twice the QE of the PMT. A measure-
ment of the absolute PDE with a calibrated photodi-
ode will be done in the near future.

Figure 7: PDE of an MPPC relative to the QE of a
PMT as a function of the applied voltage.

We have measured the PDE of an MPPC relative
to that of a PMT using a setup shown in Fig. 6.
An MPPC and a PMT are illuminated with green
light from a wavelength shifting ﬁber, Kuraray Y11,
through a slit with 1 mm diameter. We use Hama-
matsu PMT H3165-10 with bialkali photo-cathode as
a reference. Comparing the number of detected photo-
electrons between the MPPC and the PMT, the rela-
tive PDE is measured.
In order to avoid the eﬀect
of cross-talk, the number of photoelectrons for the
MPPC is derived from the fraction of pedestal (=
0 p.e.) events to the total number of trigger, assum-
ing a Poisson distribution. For the PMT, the number
of photoelectrons is calculated by dividing the mean
output charge by the charge corresponding to 1. p.e.

Figure 8: Response of an MPPC as a function of light
intensity.

The linearity of the MPPC response to a large
amount of light is intrinsically limited by the ﬁnite
number of micropixels. Figure 8 shows the number of
ﬁred pixels of an MPPC as a function of light inten-
sity. The number of generated photoelectrons inside
the active area is estimated by the intensity of the
light monitored by a PMT. The red curve shows the
expected response of the MPPC based on the known
number of pixels and the measured cross-talk proba-
bility. The deviation from the expected curve is found
to be within 5%. Thus, the response of the MPPC is
well described by the number of pixels and measured
cross-talk rate.

4. TEST WITH A LASER INJECTION
SYSTEM

In order to check the response of each micro APD
pixel, we have tested the MPPC with a pulsed laser
system. The laser has a spot size on the surface of
an MPPC with a diameter of about 10 µm so that
the uniformity of the response inside a micropixel can
be studied. The MPPC is placed on a X-Y movable
stage that can be controlled with 1 µm accuracy. The
wavelength and the temporal width of the laser are
825 nm and 50 ps, respectively. For this test, a sample
MPPC with 100 pixels is used.

First, the dependence of the response to the posi-
tion within a micropixel is studied. The light spot is
injected onto a pixel and the area within a pixel is
scanned with 10 µm pitch. Figure 9 shows the mea-
sured response for one pixel. Because we do not know
the number of injected photons in this measurement,
the z axis is arbitrary and show the relative response.
It is found that the response is uniform within the
active area of the micropixel.

4.2. Pixel-to-pixel uniformity

The pixel-to-pixel uniformity of the gain and the
relative eﬃciency are tested by injecting light in the
center of each pixel. The results are shown in Fig. 10.
The z axis is normalized so that the average over all
pixels is 1.0. The gain and relative eﬃciency are found
to be uniform within 3.6% and 2.5% in RMS, respec-
tively.

plier tube.

The development of MPPCs has advanced well in
the past ∼2 years, and the basic functionality of the
device has been established. We will continue the
R&D for more practical development aiming at real
use as well as wider application. The future develop-
ment will include realization of devices with (but not
limited to):

5. SUMMARY AND PROSPECTS

The multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) is a newly
developed photodetector with an excellent photon
counting capability. It also has many attractive fea-
tures such as small size, high gain, low operation volt-
age and power consumption, and capability of opera-
tion in magnetic ﬁelds.

We have shown that the basic performance of the
MPPC is promising and actually already satisfactory
for use in real experiments: a gain of ∼106 is achieved
with noise rate less than 1 MHz with 1 p.e. thresh-
old and cross-talk probability of less than 30% at
room temperature. The photon detection eﬃciency

• larger area,

• reduced cross-talk,

• a larger number of pixels, and

• better photon detection eﬃciency.

Also, the following issues must be investigated for
practical use.

• long term stability,

• quality control under mass production,

• development of suitable readout electronics, and

• packaging and coupling to radiator.

In addition, for wider application we need to investi-
gate:

• radiation hardness,

• timing resolution, and

• high rate capability.

ful discussions. This work was supported in part by
a Grand-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research from Ministry

Although there remains some work necessary before
real application, we already have plans for most of
this work in the near future.

The MPPC is one of the most attractive devices
for photon detection in future high energy physics,

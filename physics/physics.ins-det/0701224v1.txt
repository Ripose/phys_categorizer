Abstract

The magnetic-ﬁeld stability of a mass spectrometer plays a crucial role in precision mass

measurements. In the case of mass determination of short-lived nuclides with a Penning trap,

major causes of instabilities are temperature ﬂuctuations in the vicinity of the trap and pressure

ﬂuctuations in the liquid helium cryostat of the superconducting magnet. Thus systems for the

temperature and pressure stabilization of the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at the

ISOLDE facility at CERN have been installed. A reduction of the ﬂuctuations by at least one order

of magnitude downto ∆T ≈ ±5 mK and ∆p ≈ 50 mtorr has been achieved, which corresponds to
a relative frequency change of 2.7 × 10−9 and 1.5 × 10−10, respectively. With this stabilization

the frequency determination with the Penning trap only shows a linear temporal drift over several

hours on the 10 ppb level due to the ﬁnite resistance of the superconducting magnet coils.

1 Introduction

The exact masses of stable and exotic nuclides are important input values for many areas of physics.

Since the mass defect is intrinsically connected to the binding energy of the nucleus, the nuclear

properties are reﬂected by the nuclear masses and mass diﬀerences, e.g.

the Q-values of nuclear

decays. Mass values can therefore contribute to tests of nuclear models and nuclear structure [1],

where especially nuclides far from the valley of stability are of interest. Low production rates and

half-lives of only a few tens of milliseconds make high-accuracy mass measurements for these exotic

nuclides a challenge.

Depending on the respective application of mass values, the required relative mass uncertainty
ranges from 10−6 in nuclear physics to 10−11 in atomic physics and metrology [2, 3]. One example is

the precise and accurate determination of atomic masses for nuclides that exhibit a superallowed beta

decay, where besides the half-life, the branching ratio, and theoretical corrections, the Q-value and

thus the mass contributes to a test of the unitarity of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark-mixing

matrix of the Standard Model [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

Mass measurements at this level of precision are possible with Penning traps [10], where the

cyclotron frequency

νc =

1
2π

qB
m

(1)

of the stored ions with mass m and charge q in a strong homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B can be

monitored, e.g, with a time-of-ﬂight (TOF) detection technique [11].

The magnetic ﬁeld amplitude B is calibrated by measuring the cyclotron frequency of a stable

nuclide with well-known mass. Usually the magnetic ﬁeld is sampled before and after the frequency

measurement of the nuclide of interest, and the ﬁeld amplitude is linearly interpolated between the

two reference measurements [12]. Any ﬂuctuation of the ﬁeld can thus lead to a deviation of the

deduced cyclotron frequency from the actual value and therefore to the loss of accuracy. Especially

in the case of exotic nuclides with low production yields, for which a frequency measurement can last

up to several tens of minutes or even a few hours, a stable magnetic ﬁeld is crucial.

The amplitude of the magnetic ﬁeld of a superconducting magnet is inﬂuenced by internal and

external environmental parameters and thus, if these are not constant, the B-ﬁeld may vary as a

function of time. For the superconducting magnets of the ISOLTRAP experiment [13, 14] there is a

decay of the ﬁeld strength due to the ﬁnite resistance of the superconducting coils (ﬂux creep [15]). In

addition, temperature ﬂuctuations in the room temperature bore of the magnet lead to ﬂuctuations

of the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude, since the magnetic susceptibility of the material inside the B-ﬁeld

changes as a function of temperature. Furthermore, pressure ﬂuctuations in the helium recovery line

also inﬂuence the magnetic ﬁeld strength, because the temperature of the liquid helium, in which the

2

superconducting coils are located, depends on the pressure in the cryostat of the magnet.

Recently, regulations of both the helium reservoir pressure and the temperature in the warm bore

of the superconducting magnet have been installed and tested at the SMILETRAP Penning trap mass

spectrometer for highly-charged stable ions [16]. In the present work, a similar implementation of both

regulation systems at the ISOLTRAP on-line mass spectrometer for short-lived ions is described and

the reduction of ﬂuctuations is speciﬁed with respect to future improvements in the mass determination

of exotic nuclides.

2 Experimental setup and frequency determination

For the preparation and high-accuracy mass measurement of radionuclides a combination of three

ion traps is used at ISOLTRAP (see Fig. 1). The experimental setup has been described in detail in

[13, 14] and here only a brief summary is given.

The ﬁrst ion trap is a radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) structure in a helium buﬀer-gas envi-

ronment [17], which stops, cools, and bunches the continuous 60-keV radioactive ion beam from the

target/ion-source system of ISOLDE [18]. The ion bunch is transferred to the preparation Penning

trap [19] for further cooling and removal of contaminating isobaric ions with a buﬀer-gas cooling tech-

nique [20]. The mass-selected ensemble of ions is ﬁnally transferred to the precision Penning trap for

mass measurement with the TOF cyclotron-resonance detection technique [11].

The measurement principle includes ﬁrst a dipolar radiofrequency (rf) excitation of the low-

frequency magnetron motion and second a quadrupolar rf excitation. If the quadrupolar excitation is

in resonance with the cyclotron frequency, i.e. νrf = νc, the magnetron motion is converted into the

high-frequency cyclotron motion of the same radius and thus the ions gain maximum radial kinetic

energy [21, 22]. The ions are ejected from the trap and slowly drift upstream towards an ion detec-

tor. Along the way the ions drift through a magnetic ﬁeld gradient where the initial radial energy is

converted into axial kinetic energy due to the coupling of the magnetic moment to the ﬁeld gradient

[11]. Thus resonantly excited ions experience a larger acceleration than non-excited ones and therefore

reach earlier the detector.

By scanning the excitation frequency around the expected cyclotron frequency, a TOF cyclotron

resonance curve is obtained, as shown for 133Cs+ in the inset of Fig. 1. Due to the ﬁnite excitation

duration the resonance curve exhibits a characteristic shape which is related to the Fourier transform.

The shape of the curve is well known [22] and can be ﬁtted to the data points (solid line). For the

investigation of the temperature and pressure dependence, the cyclotron frequencies νc of 85Rb+ and

133Cs+ ions from the alkali reference ion source of ISOLTRAP have been monitored as a function of

time.

3 Magnetic ﬁeld stabilization

3.1 Temperature-frequency correlation

The correlation between the temperature in the warm bore of the superconducting magnet and the cy-

clotron frequency of ions stored in the precision Penning trap has been observed recently at ISOLTRAP

[23]. The temperature change was monitored with the change of the resistance of a Pt100 sensor

(platinum resistance thermometer) mounted in the vicinity of the Penning trap vacuum tube. The

cyclotron frequency of 85Rb+ and the measured resistance are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 2.

The variation of the cyclotron frequency and of the resistance, and thus of the temperature, shows a

strong correlation. If the resistance data points are scaled relative to the frequency data and if a linear

temporal drift of the magnetic ﬁeld strength is taken into account, i.e. a linear drift of the cyclotron

frequency, the two curves nicely match as shown in Fig. 2 (bottom). The frequency can be described

by

νc(R, t) = a(R − R0) − bt + c,

where R0 = 109.5 Ω, a = 0.617(5) HzΩ−1, b = 0.0685(6) Hzd−1, and c = 1069831.132(3) Hz. The

linear ﬁeld drift is thus of the order of

1
B

dB
dt

= − b
c

= (−2.67 ± 0.02) × 10

−9 h

−1.

Note that the previously reported linear drift of the magnetic ﬁeld of ISOLTRAP with a value of
(−2.30 ± 0.03) × 10−8 h−1 [12] has most likely a wrong exponent.

3.2 Temperature stabilization

Although the ISOLDE experimental hall is equipped with an air condition, large temperature ﬂuctua-

tions of about 0.5 K are observed during a day. At ISOLTRAP these lead to a change of the cyclotron

frequency of the order of e.g. 0.1 Hz for 133Cs+ or a relative frequency change of almost 100 ppb.

Therefore, a temperature regulation is advantageous for the investigation of radionuclides with a low

production yield, for which long measurement periods of more than one hour are needed to record a

suﬃciently large number of ions to obtain a cyclotron resonance.

The layout of the temperature stabilization system is shown in Fig. 3. A closed aluminum tube

is attached to both sides of the room temperature bore of the magnet. The tube encloses a heater,

two fans, and three temperature sensors. These integrated circuit transducers (AD590 from Analog

Device) produce an output current proportional to the absolute temperature. For a supply voltage in

the range between 4 V and 30 V each sensor acts as a high-impedance constant-current regulator with

1 µA/K. The devices are calibrated to 298.2 µA output at a temperature of 298.2 K. In the present

(2)

(3)

4

system a ﬂatpack model was applied which ﬁts between the magnet bore and the vacuum tube and

has a good contact with the vacuum tube surface.

In addition to the ﬁrst sensor at the position of the Penning trap (see Fig. 3), and to the second

and third at the top and bottom of the superconducting magnet bore, a fourth one has been installed

in the vicinity of the magnet for the room temperature measurement. The central sensor is used to

measure the temperature for the control loop. The sensors are read out with a multichannel digital

multimeter (Keithley data acquisition system, model 2700), which is connected via a GPIB (General

Purpose Interface Bus) interface to a computer.

The temperature regulation system is controlled by a LabVIEW program, which implements a

PID (for Proportional, Integral, and Derivative) regulation routine [24]: The temperature reading

from the central temperature sensor is compared to a set temperature value and the required heating

power is supplied from a Keithley power supply (model 2303) with a maximum output of 45 W to a

50 W resistor inside a heater box. The applied current is controlled by the PID regulation in order to

maintain the constant set bore temperature, while the air is constantly circulated by use of two fans.

In Fig. 4 the room temperature and the bore temperature are shown as a function of time. Without

the PID regulation the center temperature (bottom) roughly follows the variation of the room temper-

ature (top). Once turned on, the center temperature is stabilized (depending on the PID parameters),

in the present case to ∆T = ±20 mK.

3.3 Helium pressure stabilization

For the stabilization of the pressure in the helium cryostat of the superconducting magnet a commercial

system from MKS has been implemented. Without regulation the pressure shows a behavior as

plotted in Fig. 5 (top). Such pressure ﬂuctuations are due to changes in the atmospheric pressure and

changes in the gas load of the helium-recovery line at ISOLDE. A Fourier transform reveals the fastest

signiﬁcant periodic changes with a period of T = 12 h, i.e., a regulation system as presented in the

following is suitable for these slow variations.

The layout of the regulation system is shown in Fig. 6. The helium exhaust line of the magnet

cryostat is connected to a regulation valve (MKS, model 248), which is controlled by a regulation

system (MKS, model 250E), that uses a PID regulation loop. The pressure is determined by a

pressure transducer (MKS, Baratron 627B), which is temperature stabilized in order to allow reliable

pressure readings independent of the room temperature ﬂuctuations.

The PID controller compares the measured pressure at the helium exhaust line with the desired set

point and adjusts the gas ﬂow through the regulation valve in order to reach the requested pressure.

Note that the set point for the pressure in the cryostat must be higher than the pressure in the recovery

line to prevent backstreaming of the helium into the cryostat. For security reasons a bypass valve is

5

opened during the reﬁlling of the liquid helium cryostat to allow a fast release of the larger amount

of evaporated helium into the recovery line.

The three PID regulation parameters [24] are manually adjusted with two front panel potentiome-

ters: one for the proportional gain, which is internally combined with the integral parameter, and one

for the derivative gain (or phase lead). As an example, the regulated pressure is shown as a function

of time in Fig. 7 (top) for three diﬀerent gain values for the response to the pressure diﬀerence. With

the appropriate phase lead being set according to the rapidity in pressure changes, a gain value of 75

gives the fastest recovery of the system in the present case. Once set, the pressure remains constant

as shown in Fig. 7 (middle) where the pressure variation lies within ∆p(F W HM ) = 45 mtorr.

4 Results and discussion

4.1 Temperature and pressure dependence

In order to specify the stability of the temperature and the pressure regulation and therefore the

stability of the frequency determination, either the temperature or the pressure is deliberately changed

while the other parameter is kept ﬁxed. The change of the cyclotron frequency is monitored by

examining stable 133Cs+ ions from the alkali reference ion source.

In Fig. 8 (a) the temperature in the center of the room temperature bore of the superconducting

magnet is shown as a function of time. For the following test measurement the set temperature has

been changed deliberately from 295.9 K to 296.4 K, i.e., an increase by 0.5 K, and after about 5 hours

it was reset to 295.9 K. The resulting change of the cyclotron frequency νc of 133Cs+ is shown in

Fig. 8 (b). Each data point includes about 700 ions for a quadrupolar rf-excitation of 900 ms in order

to keep the statistical uncertainty well below the observed frequency shift caused by the temperature

change.

As expected a correlation of the temporal behavior of the temperature and the cyclotron frequency

is observed. Taking the linear temporal drift of the magnetic ﬁeld into account, the expected cyclotron

frequency at a temperature T in the room temperature bore for a ﬁxed and stabilized helium reservoir

pressure can be expressed by

νc(T, t) = a(T − T0) − bt + c,

which is the analogue expression to the one in Eq. (2). From a χ2-minimization with a ﬁxed value
T0 = 295.9 K the parameters a = 0.182(13) HzK−1, b = 0.0018(4) Hzh−1, and c = 683486.135(6) Hz,

are deduced for the 133Cs data. The ﬁeld drift is thus

in agreement to the previously determined value.

For a 0.5 K temperature change, the observed change of the 133Cs+ cyclotron frequency is 91 mHz

(see Fig. 8 (b)). Assuming a linear dependence, this yields a temperature coeﬃcient of 0.182 mHz/mK

and for the planned stabilization of the temperature to ±5 mK this results in a relative frequency
change of 2.7 × 10−9.

A similar measurement has been performed for the change of the pressure in the liquid helium

cryostat. The result is shown in Fig. 9. The set pressure of the regulation system has been changed by

30 torr. A ﬁt to the data points of a linear relation in analogy to Eq. (4), νc(p, t) = a(p − p0) − bt + c,
yields a frequency change of 1 mHz/torr. Thus, for a stabilization of the pressure to ±0.1 torr a
relative frequency change of 2.9 × 10−10 can be achieved. Note that in contrast to the averaged

experimental data in case of a temperature change (Fig. 8 (c), thin line), the averaged data for a

pressure change (Fig. 9 (c), thin line) shows a slight delay as compared to the expected behavior (thick

line). Nevertheless, this might be an artefact and has no signiﬁcant inﬂuence.

4.2 Other eﬀects

In addition to magnetic ﬁeld variations that are correlated to temperature and pressure changes, the

magnetic ﬁeld strength can also be inﬂuenced by ferromagnetic metallic objects in the vicinity of the

superconducting magnet, which can distort the magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of ISOLTRAP the beam of

a bridge crane mounted at the ceiling of the experimental hall of ISOLDE can cause large frequency

shifts if it is placed above the superconducting magnet of the precision Penning trap.

In Fig. 10 a consecutive series of measurements of the cyclotron frequency of 85Rb+ ions is shown.

When the steel beam of the bridge crane was moved over the magnet, the cyclotron frequency dropped

about 600 mHz due to the distortion of the magnetic ﬁeld. This corresponds to a relative change of
5.6 × 10−7. As soon as the bridge crane is moved away from the magnet, the cyclotron frequency

returns to its previous value. There is no attempt to compensate for this change, rather it is avoided

to move the beam of the bridge crane over the magnet during data collection.

4.3 Stabilized frequency measurement

Fig. 11 shows a measurement of the cyclotron frequency of 133Cs+ for which a temperature stabilization

to ±5 mK has been achieved. Within the statistical uncertainty the frequency data points show only

the linear temporal drift due to the residual resistance of the superconducting coils. Note that the room

temperature ﬂuctuations have been well below 500mK during the data taking. Since the optimal PID

paramaters have not been found yet, the general performance of the stabilization system still needs to

be investigated and only the inﬂuence of the temperature variations on the frequency measurements

can be deduced.

7

Figure 12 shows cyclotron frequency data from 85Rb+ and 133Cs+ that were measured as references

during a beam time for the determination of the mass of neutron-rich Sn nuclides. The masses of
these stable nuclides are known with a relative uncertainty δm/m = 1.4 × 10−10 and 1.8 × 10−10,
respectively [25]. The current limit for the mass determination at ISOLTRAP is δm/m = 8 × 10−9

[12], i.e. any ﬂuctuation or systematic shifts can be probed with the two reference nuclides. The

lines in Fig. 12 are weighted linear ﬁts to the data points. The B-ﬁeld drifts for 85Rb+ and 133Cs+
are (−2.2 ± 0.2) × 10−9 h−1 and (−2.1 ± 0.1) × 10−9 h−1, respectively. The ﬁts also yield the oﬀsets

(at t = 0) νc = 1 069 815.730(15)Hz and 683 491.576 9(37) Hz, respectively, and therefore a frequency

ratio 0.638 887 200 6(96), where the uncertainty is mainly due to the low statistics of the 85Rb+ data.

From the literature values a frequency ratio 0.638 887 196 90(15) is expected, i.e. the measured value

agrees within the uncertainties.

Finally, the linear drift of the magnetic ﬁeld as deduced from the various investigations in the

present work can be compared to the value given in [12]. A summary is shown in Fig. 13. There is

a good agreement except in the case of the data presented in Fig. 2, for which a signiﬁcant shift is

observed. Possibly the uncertainty is underestimated. In addition, the linear drift must not necessarily
have a constant value within several years. Nevertheless, a value of −2.30 × 10−9 h−1 seems to be a

reasonable estimate for the linear drift.

5 Summary and outlook

The magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the precision Penning trap of ISOLTRAP has been stabilized with

respect to the temperature in the room-temperature bore of the magnet as well as to the pressure

in the helium cryostat. A strong correlation of the cyclotron frequency to the temperature of the

vacuum tube around the Penning trap has been observed. With a stabilization down to ±5 mK only a

negligible linear decrease of the cyclotron frequency due to the ﬁnite resistance of the superconducting

coils was observed within the statistical limits. The parameters of the PID temperature regulation

are currently under investigation to further decrease the remaining small oscillations of the regulated

temperaturea and to obtain a more robust system which is capable of stabilizing the center temperature

to ±5 mK also for larger room-temperature ﬂuctuations. In addition, a stabilization of the pressure in

the liquid helium reservoir of the magnet to less than ±50 mtorr was achieved. With these stabilization

systems ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld have been reduced by a factor 4 below the current limit of

accuracy of ISOLTRAP. The improvement with respect to the ISOLTRAP mass measurements will

be investigated soon.

tube (bottom) as a function of time as measured by a AD590 sensor. At about t = 80 h the PID

regulation was turned on. The solid line shows the set temperature, T = 295.9 K and the dashed lines

give the range of the temperature variations, i.e. ±20 mK.

gain values. The three curves have been aligned along the time axis with respect to the maximum

value. Center: Regulated pressure for a gain value of 75 as a function of time. Bottom: Enlarged view

on the pressure values, where the dashed line indicates the mean pressure with a FWHM of 45 mTorr

Figure 8: (a) Temperature in the vicinity of the Penning trap as a function of time. At t = 3.3 h and

t = 9.8 h the set value of the PID regulation has been shifted and reset, respectively. (b) Cyclotron

frequency of 133Cs+ (circles) and the expected frequency as deduced from the temperature behavior

by ﬁtting Eq. (4) (solid line). The dashed lines show the linear drift as a function of time for the

two outmost temperature settings. (c) Same as (b) for averaged frequency data (thin line) taking

10 neighboring data points into account. The drop between t = 8 h and 9 h is due to a bridge crane

movement over the superconducting magnet (see also Fig. 10).

Figure 9: (a) Pressure in the helium exhaust line as a function of time. At t = 24.2 h and t = 28.7 h the

set value of the pressure regulation has been shifted by 30 torr and reset, respectively. (b) Cyclotron

frequency of 133Cs+ (circles) and the expected frequency as deduced from the pressure behavior by

ﬁtting an analogue expression of Eq. (4) (solid line). The dashed lines show the linear drift as a

function of time for the two outmost pressure settings. (c) Same as (b) for averaged frequency data

(thin line) taking 10 neighboring data points into account.

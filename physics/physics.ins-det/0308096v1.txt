ABSTRACT

ATLAS is a detector under construction to explore the physics at the Large Hadron
Collider at CERN. It has a muon spectrometer with an excellent momentum resolu-
tion of 3-10%, provided by three layers of precision monitored-drift-tube chambers
in a toroidal magnetic ﬁeld. A single drift tube measures a track point with a mean
resolution close to 100 µm, even at the expected high n and γ background rates.
The tubes are positioned within the chamber with an accuracy of 20 µm, achieved
by elaborate construction and assembly monitoring procedures.

1 Introduction

The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will explore the Higgs
sector of the standard model as well as new physics at energy scales of 1-10 TeV. The
ATLAS muon spectrometer provides a momentum resolution of 3-10% for momenta
between 10 and 1000 GeV/c [1]. This is achieved by the precise reconstruction of
the muon trajectories with three stations of monitored-drift-tube (MDT) chambers
in a typically 0.4 T toroidal magnetic ﬁeld over distances of 6-10 m. The MDT
chambers consist of 3 or 4 layers of cylindrical aluminum drift tubes of 30 mm
diameter with only 0.4 mm wall thickness, on each side of an aluminum support
frame. The tubes contain 50 µm diameter gold-plated W-Re sense wires. They are

1

operated with Ar:CO2 (93:7) gas mixture at 3 bar pressure and a gas gain of 2·104.
Each drift tube measures a track point with an average resolution of 100 µm. With
this resolution, the required tracking precision is achieved provided the positions of
the sense wires within the chamber are known with an accuracy of 20 µm (rms).

2 Construction of Monitored Drift Tube Chambers

The MDT chambers are assembled on a granite table with precise mechanical tools.
The tube layers are glued consecutively to the support frame. The mechanical accu-
racy of the chambers is monitored with several monitoring techniques. As an exam-
ple, we describe the chamber assembly at the Max Planck Institute f¨ur Physik [2].
The sense wires are centered in the individual tubes with an accuracy of 7 µm (rms)
as veriﬁed by X-ray measurement of each tube. The 72 tubes of a layer are then po-
sitioned with an accuracy of 5 µm on the assembly table. The positioning is veriﬁed
with mechanical feeler gauges. The support frame is positioned on the table with
an accuracy of 5 µm and glued to the tube layer on the table. The relative posi-
tioning of the glued tube layers is monitored with optical RASNIK [3] sensors. The
gravitational deformations of the frame are measured by another RASNIK system
and compensated during the gluing by computer-controlled pneumatic actuators.
The monitoring techniques allow for the veriﬁcation of the required wire-positioning
accuracy of 20 µm for all chambers. In addition, for about 15% of the chambers, the
wire positions are measuremed with an X-ray scanning device at CERN [4]. The
geometrical parameters of the wire grid, the wire pitch in the direction parallel (z)
and vertical (y) to the assembly table and the distance between the triple layers
(ML) are reproducible and in good agreement with the nominal values (see Fig. 1).

3 MDT Chamber Performance under LHC Operating Conditions

At the LHC, the chambers will be exposed to a high neutron and γ background
with counting rates of up to 100 Hz/cm2. The performance of an MDT chamber at
LHC background count rates was tested under nominal operating conditions in the
γ irradiation facility at CERN with a 137Cs source and a 100 GeV muon beam. The
spatial resolution of a single drift tube is computed as σ(r) = qV ar(r − rS) where
r is the impact radius measured in the drift tube and rS the position extrapolated
from a silicon strip tracking detector, used as external reference. Fig. 2 shows the
resolution of a drift tube as a function of r and the average tube resolution by
diﬀerent γ irradiation rates. The resolution is degraded with increasing irradiation
due to the increasing eﬀect of space charge ﬂuctuations on the drift time (see [5]).
However, even at the highest expected rate of 100 Hz/cm2, a high average spatial
resolution of 114 µm - only 10 µm worse than without irradiation - is achieved. The
single tube resolution is expected to improve with the ﬁnal read-out electronics.

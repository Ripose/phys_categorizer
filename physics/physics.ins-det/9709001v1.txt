Abstract

The performance of 16 and 64 channel photomultipliers coupled to scintillating
ﬁbers has been tested. The devices are sensitive to single photoelectrons, show little
gain losses for magnetic ﬁelds up to 100 Gauss and have moderate optical cross-
talk. The maximum channel to channel gain variations reach a factor two for the
16 channel version and a factor of four for the 64 channel PM. The measurements
and simulations indicate that the photomultipliers are well suited for the light
detection in ﬁber trackers.

1 Introduction

Scintillating ﬁber trackers constitute an interesting alternative to gaseous tracking detec-
tors. Impressive progress has been made in the last years in both the quality of plastic
ﬁbers and the optical readout [1][2][3]. Fiber detectors avoid all the problems related
to HV connections, sparks, electronic noise and pick-up in wire chambers and MSGC
detectors.
In view of these advantages the Hera-B [5] collaboration investigated the
possibility to build an inner tracker of scintillating ﬁbers as an alternative to a MSGC
system. The ﬁber solution was ﬁnally abandoned due to the higher cost for a 150000
channel system and expected radiation damage. Nevertheless the results of the study
are of possible interest for detectors operating under diﬀerent experimental conditions.

Sensitive light detection is most eﬃciently achieved with photomultipliers. To reduce cost
and space one has to use multichannel systems. Interesting alternative solutions provide
multichannel PMs (MCPM)[1][6] built in standard technique, hybrid PMs (HPMT)[4]
and visible light counters (VLPC)[3]. The latter provide by far the best photoeﬃciency of
up to 80 %, but need cooling to below 10K. HPMTs allow for a ﬁner spatial segmentation
than MCPMs but require higher voltages and low noise ampliﬁcation. In this article we
present measurements with a readout system consisting of ﬁbers coupled to small size
16 and 64 channel photomultipliers [7].

In the following sections we describe the setup, the simulation of the photon propagation
and, ﬁnally, the measurements which concentrated on the investigation of the inﬂuence
of magnetic ﬁelds and the cross-talk between channels.

Figure 1: Setup to measure the optical cross-talk.

2 The setup

We investigated multichannel photomultiplier tubes1 [7] with 16 (M16) and 64 channels
(M64) on a square sensitive area of 18 × 18mm2. The tubes have bialkali photocathodes
and metal channel dynode structures of front pad sizes of 4×4mm2 (M16) and 2 ×2mm2
(M64). The gaps between the dynodes of the matrix next to the window are 0.5mm
(M16) and 0.3mm (M64) respectively.

Two diﬀerent setups were used to measure the gain uniformity of the PM tubes and the
optical cross-talk between adjacent channels. For the uniformity measurement a LED was
operated at a distance of 30cm in front of the PM tube. The experimental arrangement
for the cross-talk measurement (see Fig.1) consisted of a ﬁber guide mounted on a x-y-
z-table which was moved under computer control across the PM window. The ﬁber was
pressed by a spring onto the PM window.

In order to investigate the PM performance in magnetic ﬁelds, the PM was placed be-
tween two Helmholtz coils providing ﬁelds of up to 130 Gauss.

For the uniformity measurement the light was produced by standard green or blue LEDs.
Short light pulses of the LED were generated by a special high current control circuit
with adjustable pulse width. The optical cross-talk measurements were performed with
scintillation light produced by β

rays from a Sr90-source in scintillating ﬁbers.

The anode signals of the PM channels were ampliﬁed by standard NIM linear ampliﬁers
with a ﬁxed gain factor of 10. They were digitized by CAMAC ADCs coupled to a PC.

In the Hera-B experiment rates of 200kHz per channel are expected with average signal
of 20 photoelectrons. The total photocurrent reaches 0.1mA for the 64 channel tube. To
reduce the bleeder current an active voltage divider circuit for the dynodes (Fig. 2) was

developed. Compared to a passive chain the current and correspondingly the number of
HV power supplies and the heat dissipation can be reduced by a factor of ﬁve.

3 Simulation of photon propagation

Photons produced in a scintillating ﬁber are usually transferred to the photosensitive
device via clear plastic ﬁbers. The coupling of the ﬁbers, reﬂection losses and the con-
nection of the clear ﬁber to the PM aﬀect the photoelectron yield and their lateral
distribution. We have simulated these processes. For the numerical estimates we used
refraction indices for the ﬁber (nf ), its gladding (ncl), the PM window (nw) and the
photocathode (nca) of nf = 1.60, ncl = 1.42, nw = 1.53 and nca = 3.4.

In the following we assume that the cross section of the ﬁbers is circular. The trapping
probability of the photons then depends on the distance of the production point from
the surface. The trapping eﬃciency across the ﬁber is shown in Figure 3. The high
eﬃciency for photons produced near the surface is due to the trapping of photons with
rather large angles with respect to the ﬁber axis which then spiral along the surface
in azimutal direction. The average trapping eﬃciency is t = 1 − (ncl/nf )2 = 0.213.
When the scintillating ﬁber is coupled to a clear ﬁber a large fraction of the spiraling
photons is lost, the exact amount depending on the ratio of the diameters and the relative
lateral positions of the axises. In the limit where photons are produced uniformly in the
scintillating ﬁber, where the scintillating ﬁber is coupled axially at the center of the clear

Figure 3: Trapping eﬃciency across a scintillating ﬁber. Spiraling photons are lost when

ﬁber and where the radius of the scintillating ﬁber is negligible compared to the clear ﬁber
radius the trapping eﬃciency is reduced by a factor of about two: t = 1 −ncl/nf = 0.113.

Spiraling photons suﬀer from a high number of reﬂections at the ﬁber surface and thus
have a higher probability to be lost than photons crossing the ﬁber axis. The losses
depend on the quality of the surface and on the circular symmetry of the ﬁber. Often
the cross section of so-called round ﬁbers is in reality slightly elliptical and varying along
the ﬁber. These losses which are diﬃcult to estimate have also a positive aspect: They
reduce the light divergence at the exit of the ﬁber.

For an eﬃcient detection of minimum ionization particles in scintillating ﬁbers with
PMs of about 10% conversion eﬃciency a minimum scintillator thickness of about 1 to
2 mm is required, the exact value depending on the quality of the ﬁber and many other
parameters related to the light detection system. Usually several thin scintillating ﬁbers
have to be coupled to one clear ﬁber to obtain an eﬃcient and precise tracking. The
minimum radius of the clear ﬁber which one chooses as small as possible is determined
by the number and the cross section of the scintillating ﬁbers to be coupled. On the
other hand the maximum allowable cross section depends on the size of the PM channels,
the window thickness and the light divergence at the ﬁber exit.

Figure 4 shows the eﬀect of a tilt of the two axises in the coupling of the ﬁbers. Losses
start to become important only for rather large tilt angles.

The cross-talk to neighbouring PM channels is illustrated in Figure 5. The curves cor-
respond to the fraction of photoelectrons collected by neigbouring channels surrounding
one of the central pads. (Of course this fraction is lower for channels at the borders or
corners of the PM.) The photons are produced in a bundle of seven scintillating ﬁbers
(0.5mm diameter) coupled to one clear ﬁber of 3m length. The cross-talk becomes dis-
turbing when the ﬁber diameter approaches the size of the square channel pads and
is especially important for the standard window of 1.3mm thickness. For a signal of

sents the worst case, where the scintillating ﬁber is coupled at the center of a clear ﬁber.
The upper curves correspond to ﬁbers coupled at the periphery.

in average 10 photoelectrons and single photoelectron detection a channel multiplicity
between 1.6 and 2.2 for a 1.5mm diameter ﬁber is expected.

The large cross-talk for small radia and negligible reﬂection loss is due to the increase of
the number of spiraling photons when the coupled scintillating ﬁbers cover the full cross
section of the clear ﬁber. If suﬃcient light is available, the cross-talk can be reduced
drastically by setting the threshold above the one photoelectron signal.

4 Measurements and results

We have tested six M16 tubes and three 64 channel prototypes with window thicknesses
of 1.3mm, 1.0mm and 0.8mm.

4.1 Signals, ampliﬁcation

The photomultiplier tubes have a fast time response. For the 16 channel device the pulse
width for a single photoelectron is of the order of 1 to 2ns, the transit time spread is
0.3ns and the gain at the nominal voltage of 800V is 3 · 106 2. The numbers for the 64
channel tube are very similar except for a lower gain of 3 · 105 2.

For optical ﬁber read-out in ﬁber trackers the photomultipliers have to work with very
low light levels. Eﬃcient detection of single photoelectrons is therefore required. Figure
6 shows pulse height distributions for single photoelectrons measured at diﬀerent high
voltage settings for the M16 type. At voltages above 900V the single photoelectron signal

radius.

is clearly separated from noise with a signal to noise ratio larger than ten. The M64 type
has a smaller gain than the 16 channel version but a detection of single photoelectrons
is also possible with an adapted readout system.

4.2 Uniformity

The channel to channel gain variations of the M16 and M64 photomultipliers were mea-
sured using a LED at a distance of 30cm from the PM which illuminated the whole
photocathode. This conﬁguration generated single photoelectron signals. All channels
were read-out in parallel. The relative gain was calculated from the single photoelectron
peak position in the pulse height distribution. The maximum gain variation between
diﬀerent channels of the same tube is less than a factor of two for the M16 PM’s , for
M64 PM’s the variation is larger reaching a factor of four. The gain uniformity was
measured for 6 PM’s of the M16 type and the ﬁrst two available prototypes of the M64
series. Figure 7 shows for both cases a typical gain histogram.

The mean gain variation of the six tested photomultipliers of the M16 type is 25%.

4.3 Position sensitivity and cross-talk

We have measured the position sensitivity of the PMs between the individual channels by
scanning across three pads with a thin ﬁber of 50µm diameter, where light was injected

Figure 6: Single photoelectron pulse height distribution for 16 channel PM for diﬀerent
HV settings.

by a LED parallel to the axis. The response is rather uniform except for the gap region
where the eﬃciency is reduced to an average of 60%. Thus the eﬀective ineﬃcient region
is 0.2mm for the M16 and 0.1mm for the M64 tube.

In ﬁber tracker applications cross-talk between adjacent channels increases the apparent
occupancy and produces fake signals. There are two possible sources for cross-talk:
optical and electrical coupling.

Electrical cross-talk between adjacent dynode structures might occur during the electron
multiplication processes. Up to the level of about ten photoelectrons electrical cross-talk
was not observed in our measurements indicating that for applications with low light
levels the electrical cross-talk is negligible. This is explained by path length variations
and ﬂuctuations in the light emission time, coincidences between several photoelectrons
within the short transit time are unlikely in most cases.

The optical cross-talk was studied in a similar way as the sensitivity by moving a ﬁber
of diameters of 1.5mm in steps of 100 µm across three dynode pads. However, the light
was produced by irradiating a ﬁber bundle of seven scintillating ﬁbers with a Sr90-source
to achieve a more realistic light distribution. The ﬁber bundle was coupled to a 2m
long clear ﬁber which was connected to the PM. When the ﬁber is centered at a pad
the neigbouring channel receives a fraction of 0.023 of the light (Fig. 8). Thus for four
adjacent channels and a ten photoelectron average signal the channel multiplicity will
be about two for a single photoelectrons threshold. This eﬀect is especially disturbing
since adjacent PM channels will not always correspond to adjacent ﬁbers in the tracking
detector.

Figure 8: Relative photon yield as a function of the ﬁber position for two diﬀerent
window thicknesses. Adjacent channels detect 2.3% (1.3mm window) and 0.9% (0.8mm
window).

To reduce the optical cross-talk we asked the PM supplier to decrease the entrance win-
dow thickness of the photomultiplier tubes to the minimum thickness which is technically
possible. We received two prototype tubes with entrance window thicknesses of 1.0mm
and 0.8mm. The cross-talk was reduced by a factor 2.5 for the 0.8mm thick window.

Our simulations (Fig. 5) predict for the two cases cross-talks of 0.05 (0.8mm window)
and 0.13 (1.3mm window) for four adjacent channels and negligible reﬂection losses and
correspondingly 0.005 and 0.06 when we assume that we loose a fraction of 0.001 for each
photon reﬂection. The measurements (0.035) and (0.09) are located in between these
predictions.

4.4 Behaviour in a magnetic ﬁeld

At Hera-B the photomultipliers would have to be operated in regions with magnetic ﬁelds
of several Gauss up to one Tesla. The gain of conventional photomultipliers is strongly
aﬀected by magnetic ﬁelds. As a result of the deﬂection of the electrons by the magnetic
ﬁeld in MCPMs in addition to reduced gain increased cross-talk might be expected.

The inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld on the PM performance was measured with ﬁelds up
to 100G in all three directions with respect to the PM. We used single photoelectron
signals. The magnetic ﬁeld behaviour of the M16 and M64 types is very similar as
expected because both tubes have the same metal channel dynode structure except for
diﬀerent lateral dimensions. Figure 9 shows the relative anode current for the 64 channel
PM as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld in the x-, y- and z-directions where the z axis

coincides with the PM axis. The PMs are rather insensitive to magnetic ﬁelds. Within
the precision of our measurement there is no eﬀect for ﬁelds parallel to the y-axis. For
the two other ﬁeld orientations the PM signal is reduced to 80% (z-axis) and 70% (x-
axis). About half of the loss is due to a gain reduction, the remaining fraction is loss in
eﬃciency probably due to the deﬂection of the ﬁrst photoelectron.

A position scan with and without magnetic ﬁeld showed no diﬀerence in the amount of
cross-talk. Thus the MCPMs can well be operated in magnetic ﬁelds below 100G.

5 Conclusions

We have studied the possibility to use multichannel photomultipliers to read-out scintil-
lating ﬁber trackers. The device is well suited for this purpose. It is fast, sensitive to
single photoelectrons and can be operated in magnetic ﬁelds up to about 0.01 T. No elec-
tric cross-talk was observed. The optical cross-talk is of the order of 10% for the 1.3mm
version and single photoelectron detection for ﬁber diameters near the pad dimensions.
It was reduced by a factor 2.5 by replacing the 1.3mm window by a 0.8mm version. The
measured cross-talk is compatible with the simulations which also show that it depends
strongly on the amount of reﬂection losses in the ﬁbers. The gain variations from chan-
nel to channel are rather large for the 64 channel tube and require individual oﬀ-line
corrections for applications where the analog signal has to be recorded.

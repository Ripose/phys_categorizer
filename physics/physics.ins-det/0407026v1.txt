The ATLAS liquid argon hadronic end-cap calorimeter: construction and
selected beam test results

ATLAS has chosen for its Hadronic End-Cap Calorimeter (HEC) the copper-liquid argon sampling technique
with ﬂat plate geometry and GaAs pre-ampliﬁers in the argon. The contruction of the calorimeter is now approach-
ing completion. Results of production quality checks are reported and their anticipated impact on calorimeter
performance discussed. Selected results, such as linearity, electron and pion energy resolution, uniformity of en-
ergy response, obtained in beam tests both of the Hadronic End-Cap Calorimeter by itself, and in the ATLAS
conﬁguration where the HEC is in combination with the Electromagnetic End-Cap Calorimeter (EMEC) are
described.

1. INTRODUCTION

−

ATLAS is a general purpose detector in con-
struction at the p
p collider LHC at CERN.
It is designed to exploit the full discovery po-
tential as given by center of mass energy of 14
TeV and the highest luminosity of more than
1034 cm−2 s−1. The optimization of the detector
is driven by the requirements to detect new parti-
cles and physics processes as e.g. the Higgs boson
like par-
γγ, heavy W
in the decay H
ticles or supersymmetric particles. In the ATLAS
detector the hadronic liquid argon (LAr) end-cap
calorimeter (HEC) [1,2] covers the pseudorapidity
range 1.4 < η < 3.2.

To fully exploit the physics potential of AT-
LAS, an energy resolution for jets of typically
σ(E)/E = 50%pE (GeV)
3% is required for the
HEC. The desired linearity of the energy response
measured has to stay within 2% [2].

The total energy containment up to the high-
est energies as well as an acceptable low back-
ground in the muon chambers require a calorime-
ter thickness of at least 10 interaction lengths (λ)
including the electromagnetic end-cap calorime-
ter (EMEC) in front of the HEC. Fast electronics
is needed in order to keep the pile-up low.

∗On behalf of the ATLAS HEC Collaboration (Canada,
China, Germany, Russia, Slovakia).

Liquid argon technology was chosen as the ac-
tive medium for its robustness against the high
radiation levels present in this forward region.

In the following the status of the construction
of the HEC is discussed and the most recent re-
sults from the 2002 beam test measurements are
presented.

2. THE ATLAS HADRONIC END-CAP

CALORIMETER

The LAr HEC [1,2] is a sampling calorimeter
with ﬂat copper absorber plates.
It shares the
two end-cap cryostats together with the EMEC
and forward calorimeter (FCAL).

The HEC is structured in two wheels, the front
HEC1 and the rear HEC2 wheel, placed in the
cryostat behind the EMEC wheel. Each wheel
has an outer diameter of about 4 m. The length
of HEC1 (HEC2) is 0.82 m (0.96 m). The thick-
ness of the copper absorber plates is 25 mm for
HEC1 and 50 mm for HEC2, with the ﬁrst plate
being half of this normal thickness in either case.
Each wheel is made out of 32 identical modules.
The weight of HEC1 is 67 t and that of HEC2 is
90 t. In total 24 gaps for HEC1 and 16 gaps for
HEC2 are instrumented with a read-out struc-
ture. Longitudinally they are read out as seg-
ments of 8 and 16 gaps for HEC1 and 8 and 8

gaps for HEC2. The read-out structure is based
on the principle of an electrostatic transformer
(EST) [3]. The size of the liquid argon gaps be-
tween the electrode structure is 1.85 mm.

The HEC employs the concept of “active pads”:
the signals from individual pads are fed into sep-
arate preampliﬁers (based on highly integrated
GaAs electronics) and summed actively. The
electronics boards with these IC’s are positioned
directly at the module periphery, the chips are
operated in the liquid argon. Thus the input ca-
pacitances are minimized and a short signal rise
time ensured. The use of cryogenic GaAs pream-
pliﬁers and summing ampliﬁers provides the opti-
mum signal-to-noise ratio for the HEC. The “ac-
tive pad” electronics has been employed in more
than 30 cold tests with and without beam. It has
proven to be very reliable.

3. CONSTRUCTION STATUS

The construction of the HEC is almost ﬁnished:
all the modules are assembled and have passed
the cold tests, all four wheels are assembled and
one full end-cap with HEC1 and HEC2 wheels
is fully integrated into the end-cap cryostat to-
gether with the EMEC and the FCAL. The level
of high voltage (HV) problems after integration is
0.14%, not causing any acceptance losses, but
∼
rather a few speciﬁc corrections for some chan-
nels. Only one out of 3072 read-out channels is
not operational, corresponding to a failure rate of

0.03%.

4. GENERAL 2002 BEAM TEST SETUP

The 2002 beam test has been carried out in
the H6 beam-line at the CERN SPS providing
hadrons, electrons or muons in the energy range
5 GeV
200 GeV. The load in the liquid
argon cryostat consisted of one EMEC module
(1/8 of the full EMEC wheel), three HEC1 mod-
ules (3/32 of the full HEC1 wheel) and two HEC2
modules. Constrained by the cryostat dimension

≤

≤

E

the depth of the HEC2 modules were half of the
ATLAS modules. The impact angle of beam par-
ticles was 90◦ with respect to the front plane,
yielding a non-pointing geometry of the setup in
η (vertically) unlike the ATLAS situation.

In front of the ﬁrst EMEC layer a presampler
end-qcap module was placed inside the cryostat.
It allowed studies of preshower corrections with
optional additional material in front of the cryo-
stat.

Finally, scintillators for triggering and tim-
ing and 4 MWPCs with horizontal and vertical
wire planes for beam position reconstruction were
present further upstream in the beam line.

5. SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION AND

CALIBRATION

In the analysis of the beam test data, the signal
reconstruction follows closely the methods used in
previous stand-alone beam tests of the EMEC [4]
and the HEC [5]. The output signals of the
cold HEC summing ampliﬁers and the raw sig-
nals from the EMEC were carried to the front-
end boards (FEB) outside the cryostat. Here
the ampliﬁcation of the EMEC signals and signal
shaping of all signals was performed. The signals
were sampled at a rate of 40 MHz and stored in
a switched capacity array of the FEB. For each
event 7 (16) samples per EMEC (HEC) channel
were recorded together with the MWPC response,
trigger information and the TDC measured de-
lay between the trigger and the 40 MHz sampling
clock. The raw ADC samples were processed with
an optimal ﬁltering (OF) method [6] using 5 event
samples.

For the HEC the detailed knowledge of each
component in the electronics chain and the form
of the input calibration pulse was used to deter-
mine the response function, which was then used
to predict the shape for the physics signals.

The resulting predicted physics shapes together
with the autocorrelation matrices from noise runs
was used for the computation of the OF weights.
Unlike the ﬁnal situation in ATLAS with its ﬁxed
delay between trigger and sampling clock the
beam test trigger was asynchronous with respect
to the sampling clock. The OF weights were

therefore calculated in steps of 0.5 ns in order to
ﬁll the 25 ns trigger window and parametrized by
a 4th order polynomial. The accuracy for the
amplitude reconstruction following this method
1%. The required conver-
achieved the level of
sion factor from ADC counts to nA was obtained
by a proper study of calibration pulse hight.

6. ENERGY RECONSTRUCTION

The total signal deposited in the calorimeter
was estimated on event by event basis using a
cell-based two-dimensional topological clustering
algorithm.

The electronic noise σn (in nA) for each cell
was obtained by studying either muon data or
time samples located outside the physics pulse
time region.

|

E
|

Each cluster consisted of at least one cell with
a signal-to-noise ratio above 4 (E > 4σn). A
threshold on the absolute value of the signal-to-
> 2σn, was applied to all other
noise ratio,
cells. They were included in the cluster if they
shared at least one edge with a cluster member
cell satisfying
> 3σn. The symmetric cuts
on the cell and neighbor level avoided biases due
to electronics noise. Two super-clusters for the
EMEC and the HEC were deﬁned by summing
all cluster signals in the EMEC and the HEC re-
spectively. For the HEC the signals in the 3rd
layer were multiplied by 2 in order to account for
the 50 % smaller sampling fraction.

7. RESPONSE TO ELECTRONS

From Monte Carlo simulations of the beam test
conﬁguration the leakage outside the EMEC was
found to be very small for electrons and has been
neglected. Therefore the ratio of the known beam
energy (6
150 GeV) and the sum of all signals
−
in the EMEC in nA deﬁned the electromagnetic
scale factor, αEMEC
0.001 MeV/nA,
where the error is here statistical only. The vari-
ation with energy tests the linearity in the energy
range considered and was found to be better than
0.5 %.

The electromagnetic scale for the HEC was
taken from the previous
stand-alone beam
test [10], αHEC
0.03 MeV/nA, taking the
modiﬁed electronics into account. A good agree-
ment of the total visible energy in the EMEC
and HEC for pions with Monte Carlo simula-
tions based either on GEANT3 or the quark-
string-gluon-plasma (QGSP) model of GEANT4
is observed, while the GEANT4 low-and-high-
energy-pion-parameterization (LHEP) model de-
viate largely from data.

9. WEIGHTING

The non-compensating nature of

the two
calorimeters makes weighting of hadronic en-
ergy deposits necessary. A cell based weighting
method which was successfully used in previous
experiments [11,12] needs a detailed simulation
on the cell level, which is not yet available for AT-
LAS. Therefore a more coarse weighting scheme
on the super-cluster level has been applied.

With the leakage outside the detector vol-
ume as predicted by the Monte Carlo and the
known beam energy 6 weights (3 for the EMEC
and 3 for the HEC) have been ﬁtted from the
two super-cluster energies and their energy den-
leading to the weighted energies Ew =

Abstract

We evaluate the performances of a 100 µm-thick silicon strip detector (SSD)
with a 300 MeV proton beam and a 90Sr β-ray source. Signals from the SSD have
been read out using a VLSI chip. Common-mode noise, signal separation eﬃciency
and energy resolution are compared with those for the SSD’s with a thickness of
300 µm and 500 µm. Energy resolution for minimum ionizing particles (MIP’s) is
improved by ﬁtting the non-constant component in a common-mode noise with a
linear function.

1 Introduction

A silicon strip detector (SSD) has the highest position resolution among the
electric tracking devices in particle physics experiments. However, an error in
measuring the track angle is dominated by the multiple scattering eﬀect for
particles with a low velocity. If the eﬀect is reduced with a very thin SSD, new
experiments which are impossible by the present technology will be realized.

One example is a search for the T violation in the decay of B mesons [1], in
which the T -violating transverse τ + polarization in the decay B
Dτ +ν will
be measured to a precision of 10−2. In order to obtain the τ polarization the
decay vertices of B and τ must be measured separately. A simulation shows
that the experiment will be feasible only with very thin SSD’s at asymmetric-
energy B factories.

In general, a thin SSD has a small signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio because the
energy deposit in the detector is proportional to the thickness and its large
capacitance results in a large noise. Thus careful treatment of a noise in the
oﬀ-line analysis is important.

In this paper, we evaluate the performances of a 100 µm-thick silicon strip de-
tector. The performances are compared with those of the 300 µm and 500 µm-
thick silicon strip detectors.

2 Detector

Single-sided silicon detectors with the dimensions of 1 cm
1.3 cm have
been fabricated by Hamamatsu Photonics. The strip pitch is 100 µm. The
widths of implantation strips and aluminum electrodes are 42 µm and 34 µm,
respectively. Three detectors with diﬀerent thicknesses (100 µm, 300 µm, and
500 µm) were tested. The 100 µm-thick SSD was made by etching a 300 µm-
thick wafer. The analog VLSI chips (VA2 3 ) [2] are used as a readout circuit
of the detectors. An SSD and a VLSI chip were mounted on a printed circuit
board called “hybrid board”.

3 Experiment

Two diﬀerent particles were used for evaluation of the detector performances.
A proton beam was used to measure the response of detectors for baryons or
heavy particles. To see the response for light and high velocity particles which
satisfy the minimum ionizing particle (MIP) condition (E/m > 3), electrons
from a 90Sr β-ray source was used.

The experiment was carried out with a proton beam at the Research Center for
Nuclear Physics, Osaka University. Scattered protons from a 12C target were
momentum analyzed by a magnetic spectrometer. A detector system that
consists of an SSD and two trigger plastic scintillation counters was placed

at the focal plane of the spectrometer. The momentum of detected protons
was 800 MeV/c with the momentum spread of < 0.05%. The energy loss for
a proton with 800 MeV/c is 68 keV for the 100 µm-thick SSD, which is about
1.7 times larger than that for the minimum ionizing protons.

The readout system is schematically shown in Fig. 1. The hybrid board con-
sisting of a silicon strip and a VA2 chip was connected to a “repeater card”,
which contained level converters for logic signals, buﬀer ampliﬁer for analog
output signal, and adjustable bias supply for the VA2 chip. The VA2 chip was
controlled by a VME based timing board which received a trigger signal and
generated clock pulses for VA2 and a VME based ﬂash ADC board. Analog
multiplexed output from VA2 was sent to a ﬂash ADC through the repeater
card. Two layers of trigger counters were placed in front of the SSD. The re-
peater card was connected to the hybrid board with a ribbon cable for both
the analog and logic signals. The length of the ribbon cable was about 15 cm.

In order to compare the characteristics of silicon strip detectors, the operation
parameters of the VA2 readout chips were ﬁxed to standard values without
optimization for each measurement. Signal shaping time was about 700 ns.
Signals were read out in 4 µsec clock repetition. Typical trigger rate was
about 30 Hz.

In addition to a proton beam test, measurements with a 90Sr β-ray source were
also performed. The 90Sr β-ray source was placed at 15 mm from the SSD.
A collimator with a size of 2 mm in diameter and 10 mm in thickness was
used to irradiate electrons perpendicularly to the SSD. In order to realize the
minimum ionizing condition, a high energy component of β-rays was selected
by a trigger scintillation counter placed behind the SSD. Operation parameters
of the VA2 chip was the same as those at the proton beam test. Readout clock
was 400 ns. The trigger rate at the β-ray source test was about 7 Hz.

4 Analysis and Results

An output from each strip has a diﬀerent oﬀset level. These diﬀerences have
been trimmed at the ﬁrst step of the oﬀ-line analysis. Solid lines in Fig. 2
show the maximum pulse height distributions after the pedestal trimming for
100 µm, 300 µm, and 500 µm-thick SSD’s at the proton beam test. Note that
we have neglected the eﬀect of charge division among adjacent strip. Dotted
lines show the same distributions under the condition that no charged particle
hit the detector. The noise peak and proton signal peak have overlapped for
the 100 µm-thick SSD, while the proton signals are clearly distinguished from
noises for the 500 µm and 300 µm-thick SSD’s.

For 100 µm-thick SSD, a strong noise level correlation between non-adjacent
channels has been observed. This indicates that the main component of the
noise has a common phase and amplitude among the strips. This component
called common-mode noise (CMN) has been calculated as an averaged pulse
height over all strips. In the calculation, channels with signiﬁcantly large pulse
heights; larger than 3 standard deviation (σ) of the noise distribution, have
been excluded. Fig. 3 shows the maximum pulse height distribution after the
CMN subtraction for the 100 µm SSD. Proton events are clearly separated
from the noise.

We have investigated the characteristics of noise more carefully. Fig. 4(a)
shows the strip dependence of the noise width after the CMN subtraction. The
width depends on the strip number, whereas pulse height diﬀerences between

adjacent two strips shown in Fig. 4(b) have a constant value of about 6. This
indicates that the intrinsic σ of the noise is expected to be about 4.2 (= 6/√2)
for all strips. Thus, we conclude that the CMN has a non-constant component.
Instead of simply averaging the pulse heights, we ﬁt them with a linear curve
to get CMN as a function of a channel number. Fig. 4(c) shows the noise
widths after this method is applied. The widths are about 4.2 for all strips as
expected.

If the CMN is not removed correctly by assuming a constant CMN, a noise
width depends on a strip number (Fig. 4(a)). This may cause a strip depen-
dent S/N separation which are not desirable for any experiments. Fitting the
CMN with a linear curve is particularly important for the detection of MIP’s

with a thin SSD where the S/N ratio is small. The maximum pulse height dis-
tribution for electrons with 100 µm-thick SSD after subtracting the CMN by
linear-ﬁtting is shown in Fig. 5(b) compared with that with a constant CMN
subtraction (Fig. 5(a)). Although electron events are not separated from the
noise for both cases, the separation of signals from noises is improved by the
linear-ﬁtting method 4 .

Fig. 5 indicates that there is a ﬁnite probability of misidentifying a noise as a
particle track by selecting the maximum pulse height. The detection eﬃciency
and signal misidentiﬁcation probability for electrons with 100 µm-thick SSD
are plotted as a function of threshold energies in Fig. 6. When a threshold level
is set to detect the electron with an eﬃciency more than 99% the probability of
misidentiﬁcation obtained by linear-ﬁtting of CMN is 27% smaller compared
to that by the constant CMN-subtraction method.

4 β-rays were irradiated at the central strips by using a collimator. It is expected
that this improvement is clearly seen for the strips near the edge of the detector.

The S/N ratio obtained from β-ray source tests for the 100 µm and 300 µm
SSD’s are summarized in Table 1. Better S/N ratio is obtained by ﬁtting
CMN with a linear curve. The S/N ratios obtained with the assumption of a
constant CMN for both the 100 µm and 300 µm SSD’s are slightly worse. For
a 300 µm SSD, the diﬀerence of two methods in subtracting the CMN is not
very important in an actual application because the S/N ratio is suﬃciently
large. Noise width obtained in the 90Sr β-ray source test and the proton beam
test are summarized in Table 2 in energy unit (keV). The width of CMN at
the β-ray source test is diﬀerent from that at the proton beam test. But the
noise after the CMN subtraction is almost the same.

There remains a possibility to improve the S/N ratio by considering the charge
division among adjacent strips during ﬁnding a particle trajectory. Perfor-
mances of the prototype detector might be improved by optimizing its oper-
ating conditions.

5 Conclusion

An SSD with a thickness of 100 µm was tested with 800 MeV/c protons and
β-rays from 90Sr source. By using an analog VLSI chip for readout, we remove
the CMN. Assuming that CMN is constant among all strips, proton signals
are separated from noises for the 100 µm, 300 µm and 500 µm-thick SSD’s
after the CMN subtraction. We found that a non-constant component in CMN
makes the energy resolution worse. For the 100 µm SSD, the signal and noise
separation was improved by ﬁtting CMN with a linear curve at a β-ray source
test. We conclude that a 100 µm SSD with analog VLSI readout can be used as
a very thin tracking device in a future experiment. However, careful treatment

of CMN is important for detecting MIP’s.

Abstract

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) were used for the instrumentation of the iron ﬂux return of
the BABARdetector as a muon system. Unfortunately the eﬃciency of the original RPCs degraded
rapidly with time. Limited Streamer Tubes (LSTs) were chosen for an upgrade of the barrel portion
of the detector.

The phased installation started in summer 2004 with replacing two sextants of the BABARbarrel
muon system with LSTs. The modules for the remaining four sextants are under long-term test
at SLAC and ready for installation, expected in 2006. The modules become inaccessible once
installed in BABAR, so it is critical to select only perfectly working tubes. To accomplish this a
strong QC system was established during the prototype phase, and fully implemented throughout
pre-production and construction. To spot any damage during transport, the ﬁnal modules are
subjected to comprehensive tests at SLAC immediately after arrival and kept under long-term
test till installation into BABAR. Details of these tests and results from long-term testing will be
discussed. Since spring 2005 the PEP-II accelerator is running and BABARis collecting data. First
experience from data taking with the LSTs will be presented and the performance of the detector
discussed.

Introduction

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) were used as the initial technology for the Instrumentation of
the Flux Return (IFR) of the BABARdetector [1] for the identiﬁcation of muons and K0
L. Unfor-
tunately, there were many issues with the production and operation of the RPCs, which led to
signiﬁcant decrease in the per-layer eﬃciency in the ﬁrst years. For more details see [2, 3]. The
BABARcollaboration decided to upgrade the forward system with improved RPCs [4] and to replace
the RPCs in the barrel system with Limited Streamer Tubes (LSTs). The research and design
phase started in 2002 with the ﬁrst installation phase in summer 2004 and the second scheduled
for autumn 2006.

The geometry of the muon system is shown in Fig. 1. Forward, backward and barrel system
are sextant shaped. In the initial layout the barrel system consists of 19 layers, all equipped with
RPCs. Layer 19 is not accessible and no LSTs will be installed there. The inner 18 layers will be
used for the LSTs installation. To compensate for the lose of absorbing material between layers 18
and 19, brass will be installed in 6 layers. The optimal location is every second layer starting with
layer 5. The remaining 12 layer will be ﬁlled with LSTs.

2 Detector Components

The physical principle of LSTs is quite simple. Each gas-ﬁlled cell has a single wire at High Voltage
(HV). If a charged particle passed through the cell, the gas is ionised and a streamer builds up,
which can be readout from the wire. Simultaneously a signal will be induced on a plane, which is
mounted below the tube. The charge on the wire is used as the φ coordinate and the induced charge
on the plane is detected using strips perpendicular to the wire direction, giving a z-coordinate. The
r-coordinate is taken from the layer information. Together this gives a 3d information of the hit.

Figure 2: The cross section (a) and the HV endcap (b) of a tube is shown.

Therefore the basic components are limited streamer tubes and z-planes. Other components

are a gas and HV system and the readout electronics.

2.1 Limited Streamer Tubes

The cross section of a tube is shown in Fig. refﬁg:tube:sketch. It consists of 7 or 8 cells. Each cell
is 17 mm wide, 15 mm high and 380 mm long. In the middle of each cell, a gold-plated anode wire
is clamped. Six wire holders are equally distributed over the length of a cell to prevent the wire
from sagging and touching the PVC walls, which are painted with a water-based graphite paint
and kept at ground potential. Both endcaps are equipped with gas connections. One endcap also
hosts the HV connectors (Fig. 2(b)). Two wires are bundled into one HV channel. The streamer
signal is readout via a capacitor on the HV connection.

2.2 Quality Control of LSTs

The experiences with the RPCs showed that a strict quality control at all production stages is
essential to ensure excellent performance of the detector. An extensive list of quality control
procedures was established during the prototype phase and fully implemented throughout the
production phase.

The tubes were produced in Italy by Pol.Hi.Tech and then shipped to the US. At Princeton
University and Ohio State University they were assembled into larger units and ﬁnally shipped to
SLAC.

After production and before their ﬁnal assembly into units each cell of a tube is scanned with a
radioactive source. For a good tube the current is below 1 µA, with six dips in the current, where
the positions correspond to the wire holders. A typical failure is the occurrence of a continuous

discharge, where the current increases by at least 1 µA. In some cases the discharge is self sustained
and does not stop when the source is removed from the cell. Tubes failing this test are opened in
a clean room, cleaned up and assembled again. If they fail the source scan after a repair, the tube
will be rejected. Failure modes are ﬂakes of graphite paint in the cell or impurities on the wire.

After transportation the tubes are visually checked for mechanical defects and tested for trans-
portation damage by measuring the resistance and capacitance of each HV channel. All tubes are
tested for gas leaks, where a half life time of a few hours is necessary. Tubes which failed this test
are manually searched for leaks and usually repaired with Epoxy.

Each tube is HV conditioned after each production stage and after arriving at SLAC. The HV
is increased in steps of 200 V from 4900 V to 5900 V. A step is successfully completed when the
current of the tube is below 200 nA for at least 2 minutes. At 5900 V the current limit is increased
to 500 nA and the time limit to 10 minutes. For the ﬁnial burn-in process the voltage is raised
to 6000 V with the same current and time limit as at 5900 V. Afterwards the tube is kept at
5900 V for at least 10 hours. Fig. 3 shows for two diﬀerent tubes the applied voltage and measured
currents during the HV conditioning process. Fig. 3(a) shows the behaviour of an excellent tube.
The current increased only minimally with voltage increase and the current is stable and ∼100 nA
for the long-term part of the process. Fig. 3(b) shows the burn-in process. The current increases
signiﬁcant for the two highest voltage steps, and then decreases slowly over time. After 10 hours
the current is stable and below 100 nA as in the case of an excellent tube. As long as the tube is
kept on gas this behaviour will not change. The HV conditioning is repeated if the tube fails the
process at any HV step. If a tube still fails the procedure after a few tries, it is rejected. Usually
failed tubes develop a self-sustained discharge with a current well above 1 µA.

Finally the quality of each HV channel is checked by taking so called single rates. This is the
counting rate of cosmic muons as a function of the HV. The HV is varied from 4900 V to 5900 V in
steps of 100 V with a counting time of 100 seconds. Fig. 4 shows an example of the single rates for
a good tube. The counting rate starts quite low and then increases exponentially around 5000 V.
At 5100 − 5200 V the counting rate reaches a plateau, which should be at least a few 100 V. In the
case of an excellent tube the plateau can go up to 5900 V. A long and ﬂat plateau is characteristic
of a good tube.

At the moment, the remaining ∼1300 tubes for the second installation phase are under long-
term testing at SLAC. They are kept under gas ﬂow and at the operating HV of 5500 V. If the
current of a tube stays for 3 minutes above 500 nA, the HV is automatically ramped down to 0 V.
The number of trips is recorded for later use in the ﬁnal selection process and tubes exhibiting a
continuous self-sustained discharge are disconnected from HV and rejected.

2.3 Z-Planes

The z-planes are 4 m long and up to 3.8 m wide, depending on the layer in the IFR. A plane consists
of 96 copper strips, 35 mm wide with a spacing of 2 mm. They are glued on a copper ground plate,
separated by Mylar. The complete plane is vacuum laminated with a Mylar foil. The readout of
16 strips is grouped together into one ﬂat cable, where the strip and the cable are connected by a
solder joint.

The design of the z-planes is very robust, nevertheless the planes have to be tested to ensure their
proper functioning. In addition careful monitoring during installation is essential, when the planes
may come under mechanical stress, in order to carry out repairs before the z-planes are inaccessible.
For monitoring the capacitance between ground and each readout channel is measured. It should
be around ∼5 nF. Very small or zero capacitance is a clear indication of a broken solder joint.

signal channels in one tube.

Only a few broken solder joints have been found and most of them have been repaired well before
installation or while installing them.

2.4 Gas System

The gas used for the tubes is a (89:3:8) mixture of CO2, Argon and iso-butane. It is non ﬂammable
and has good quenching properties. The gas mixing system is custom built. The mixing unit uses
standard technology and is based on mass ﬂow controllers.

Half of the tubes per layer are connected in sequence to one gas line. The gas ﬂow is monitored at
the outlet with digital bubblers[5]. The total ﬂow rate of the system is 2.5 l/min, which correspond
to ∼1 volume changes per day.

2.5 High Voltage System

The requirements of the HV system is high granularity and easy accessibility. The segmentation
of the system should be so good that a single readout channel of a tube can be removed from the
supply so that the rest of the tube can be operated without any problems. On the other hand, HV
control of a whole layer and current monitoring of a single tube is suﬃcient.

The design of the HV power supplies was guided by these requirements. They are custom
built [6] and can operate between 0 and 6000 V. Each supply consists of 80 HV channels in four
independent HV groups. The current monitoring, current limits and trip times are on a channel
by channel basis. Each channel is equipped with a hardwired over-current protection circuit based
on a design from the ZEUS muon system. Starting around 3 µA the eﬀective voltage is lowered,
depending on the drawn current.

Each HV channel is split into four pins allowing access to a quarter of a tube. If a readout
channel of a tube evolves a recurring problem over a long period of time, this channel can be easily
removed from the HV supply and the other three quarters of the tube can be operated without any
problems.

The HV cables are built from multi-conductor Kerpen cable and consist of two parts connected
with a custom-inline connector: a short-haul cable mounted on the tube and a long-haul cable
going from the detector to the power supplies.

2.6 Front End Electronics

The front end electronics were specially developed for the needs of the LSTs. They interface to
the existing RPC-FIFO and are then read out into the standard BABARDAQ system. On each
motherboard four daughter boards can be installed. The signal from the wires and the strips are
diﬀerent in polarity and shape and this diﬀerence is taken care of on the daughter board level.
Common features are implemented on the motherboard. A daughter board has 16 analog input
channels. The signals are ampliﬁed, discriminated with an adjustable threshold and converted to
1-bit digital hit signals . No other information is kept, e. g. timing, charge and other shaping
information are not passed on to the DAQ system.

The crates with the front end electronics are located in the near vicinity of the BABARdetector
inside the shielding wall. They are not mounted directly on the detector to give better accessibility.

3 First Installation Phase

The ﬁrst installation phase was scheduled for August to October 2004. The RPCs from the inner 18
layers of the top and bottom sextant were removed. In 12 of the 18 layers z-planes and LSTs were
installed. In the remaining 6 layers brass was installed to increase the total absorption length and
compensate for the loss in absorption length between the 18th and 19th layer. In total 24 z-planes
for a total of 2284 z strips and 388 tubes were installed, which results in 1522 φ readout channels.
188 HV cables were used and connected to 6 power supplies. One additional power supply was
installed in the case it is needed for problematic tubes which need to be isolated. 332 signal cables
were used and connected to 84 FEC boards.

4 Second Installation Phase

The second installation phase is scheduled for autumn 2006. The remaining 4 sextants of RPCs
will be replaced with LSTs. This will be 776 tubes and 48 z-planes. Additionally, 14 HV power
supplies and 168 FEC cards will be installed.

5 Operations

−1 of e+e− collisions at the Υ(4S) resonance. This dataset will be increased to ∼250 fb

The LSTs have been maintained at the operational voltage of 5500 V since October 2004. After an
extended shutdown, BABAR resumed data taking in March 2005 and collected until October 2005
−1
∼60 fb
by summer 2006, when the next shutdown and the second installation phase is scheduled. This
dataset will be the same size as the one collected from the begin of BABAR up to summer 2004 but
with two sextants of excellent working muon detectors.

The occupancy of each wire channel is constantly monitored online during data taking. The
plateau of each cell is measured every month and all channels have a good plateau except for 5
channels. These channels trip often. The problems are diagnosed to be located between the power
supplies and the cell wires. They are isolated in the extra HV supply. At the moment they are
operated a few 100 V below the nominal operation voltage. In summary more than 99.6% of all
channels are working perfectly with no decrease over time visible.

The z strip occupancy is also monitored online. All channels except 5 give good readings. These
dead channels have been tracked down to broken solder joints and the number is constant over the
time. In summary more than 99.7% of all channels are working perfectly.

The eﬀect of these dead or not properly working channels on the physics performance is expected

to be negligible because of the high granularity in wires, strips and layers.

For every run the eﬃciency per layer is determined from a radiative di-muon sample. The aver-
age eﬃciency is above 90%, consistent with the geometrical acceptance of the LST. The eﬃciency
is constant over time.

Fig. 5 shows the pion rejection rate as a function of the muon eﬃciency for high energy muons
(2 GeV < p < 4 GeV) using a neural network based muon selection algorithm for the years 2000,
2004 and 2005. The year 2005 data is split up into LSTs and RPCs. The decrease in muon eﬃciency
and pion rejection from 2000 to 2005 is clearly visible. In 2005 the maximal muon eﬃciency using
RPCs is 88% with poor pion rejection compared to almost 94% muon eﬃciency with moderate pion
rejection in 2000. With the LSTs the overall performance is even better than the initial performance
of the RPCs in the ﬁrst year of operation (2000). For a ﬁxed muon eﬃciency, the LSTs always give

a higher pion rejection rate. The muon eﬃciency can reach almost 94% with a moderate pion fake
rate. This is a very clear indication of the success of the muon system upgrade with LSTs.

6 Conclusion

The summer 2004 installation was very successful. Almost 100% of the φ-readout and z-readout
channels are working. The eﬃciency per layer is consistent with the geometrical acceptance. This
excellent per-layer eﬃciency translates into an excellent muon selection eﬃciency of up to 94%
with a moderate pion fake rate. The overall performance with LSTs is even better than the initial
performance of the RPCs. This excellent performance is due to the stringent quality control of all
detector components at all production stages.

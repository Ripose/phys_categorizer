1 Introduction

The ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) [1] is designed to provide electron iden-
tiﬁcation and particle tracking in the high-multiplicity environment produced by heavy-ion
collisions at the LHC. In order to fulﬁll the envisaged design speciﬁcations of the detector,
accurate pulse height measurement in drift chambers operated with Xe,CO2(15%) for the
duration of the drift time of about 2 µs is a necessary requirement. For electrons, conver-
sions of transition radiation photons (TR) produced in the radiator, are superimposed on
the usual ionization energy loss. This is the crucial factor for improving the electron/pion
separation. A factor of 100 pion rejection for 90% electron identiﬁcation eﬃciency 2 is
the design goal of the ALICE TRD consisting of 6 layers. This has been achieved in
measurements with prototypes [2].

Employing the drift time information in a bidimensional likelihood [3], the pion rejection
capability can be improved by about 60% [2] compared to the standard likelihood method
on total deposited charge. This method is the simplest way of extending the standard
method. However, it does not exploit all recorded information, namely the amplitude
of the signal in each timebin. Along a single particle track this information is highly
correlated due to: i) the intrinsic detector signal, in particular since a Xe-based mixture
is used; ii) the response of the front-end electronics used to amplify the signals. Under
these circumstances, the usage of a neural network (NN) algorithm is a natural choice for
the analysis of the data [4,5,6]. Neural networks are used for a variety of tasks in modern
particle detectors [7]. A ﬁrst NN analysis for electron/pion identiﬁcation with a TRD [8]
showed that the performance can be signiﬁcantly improved.

We report results for pion rejection using a NN, which increases the pion rejection factor
up to about 500 for a momentum of 2 GeV/c. The experimental setup and method of
data analysis are described in the next section. We then present the basic ingredients of

the analysis and the topology of the neural network we have employed. The results are
presented in Section 4.

2 Experimental Setup

For the test measurements, prototype drift chambers (DC) of the ALICE TRD [1] were
used. The prototypes have a drift region of 30 mm and an ampliﬁcation region of 7 mm.
Signals from induced charge on a segmented cathode plane with rectangular pads of
8 cm length and 0.75 cm width were recorded. The drift chambers were operated with
the standard gas mixture for the TRD, Xe,CO2(15%), at atmospheric pressure, at a gas
gain of about 4000. For our nominal drift ﬁeld of 0.7 kV/cm, the detector signal is spread
over about 2 µs and is readout using a Flash ADC (FADC) system. The FADC has an

adjustable baseline, an 8-bit non-linear conversion and 20 MHz sampling frequency. The
sampling can be rebinned in the oﬀ-line analysis to obtain the 100 ns time bins envisaged
for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD design [1]. The data acquisition (DAQ) is based on a VME
event builder and was developed at GSI [9].

Figure 1 shows the time dependence of the signal on eight readout pads. Shown is a
typical pion event and a typical electron event. For the electron one can see a big cluster
at large drift times, possibly produced by TR. The average pulse height versus drift time
is shown in Figure 2. Owing to their larger Lorentz-γ electrons deposit more energy in
the drift chamber than pions with the same momentum. The peak at small drift times
originates from the ampliﬁcation region. In a TRD module the predominant absorption of
TR photons at the beginning of the drift volume leads to an additional peak for electrons
at large drift times.

Four identical drift chambers were used in the beam measurements with identical radiators
in front [2]. Measurements were carried out at momenta of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 GeV/c at the
T10 secondary beamline of the CERN PS [10]. The momentum resolution of this beam
was ∆p/p ≃ 1%. The beam contained a mixture of electrons and negative pions. For
the present analysis clean samples of pions and electrons were selected using coincident
thresholds on two Cherenkov detectors and a lead-glass calorimeter [11]. Part of the data
was taken with a scale down factor for pions, which allowed to get comparable statistics

for pions and electrons. Without the scale down factor the number of pions exceeded the
number of electrons by a factor of about 15 for a momentum of 6 GeV/c. The incident
angle of the beam with respect to the normal to the anode wires (drift direction) is 15◦ to
avoid gas gain saturation due to space charge [12]. For more details on the experimental
setup see Ref. [12].

3 Neural Network Description

The NN analyses were made using the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS) [13].
This software is equipped with a graphical user interface, which provides several diﬀerent
network types, learning algorithms and analysis tools.

3.1 Neural Network Topology for one TRD Chamber

As described above, electrons and pions produce diﬀerent patterns in the drift chambers,
the NNs should allow eﬃcient pattern recognition. From practical experience it is known
that feed forward networks using the back propagation algorithm are particularly suitable
for pattern recognition. We have rebinned the FADC data to 200 ns per timebin. More
than one pad should be used as input for the neural network, because the signal spreads
over several pads due to charge sharing. In the main analysis a 15×3 matrix of 15 timebins
and 3 pads is used as the input vector. The pads that were used were the pad with the
largest deposited charge and the two pads on either side of it. Since the usage of raw
data would lead to a full activation of all input neurons, the FADC data were normalized
to the maximum possible input. This was necessary to guarantee that no input neuron
reaches full activation, which would diminish particle separation. Other input topologies
are discussed in Section 4.3.

Neural networks were trained for single chamber, because it is impractical to generate
a network for all chambers. This is due to the general behavior of NNs 3 . A generally
accepted indicator for the performance of a neural network is the mean square error
(MSE). In order to ﬁnd an adequate topology for the hidden layers, diﬀerent networks
with none, one, two and three hidden layers were trained and tested. Increasing the number
of neurons and especially the number of hidden layers generally leads to a smaller MSE.
A neural network with three hidden layers reached the smallest value of MSE for training
data. The value of the MSE for the test data was comparable to the MSE value of the
network with only two hidden layers. In order to prevent overtraining, it was decided to use
a network topology with two hidden layers. Overtraining leads to a loss in generalization
ability and drives the NN to only recognize known patterns.

The ﬁnal network topology for one chamber is shown in Fig. 3. The network is composed
of an input layer (45 neurons), two hidden layers (15 and 7 neurons) and an output layer
(one neuron for the probability to be an electron and one for it to be a pion). Data
samples with a pion scale down factor were used to train the NNs. Samples with the same
momenta but without pion scale down were used to test the generalization of the NNs
and for validation. The learning was done using the online back propagation algorithm.
For 3000 epochs and a size of 50,000 events the training took one hour per chamber with
a P4 computer (2.4 GHz, 256 MB RAM). The validation with 20,000 events took less
than a second.

3.2 Pion Eﬃciency for Six Chambers

The next step was to combine the output of the single chamber networks to get the
pion eﬃciency for 6 chambers. For this we have tested three possibilities: i) a NN with
one hidden layer; ii) a NN without any hidden layer; iii) combining the single chamber
probabilities P (Xi|e) and P (Xi|π) into the likelihood (to be an electron) deﬁned as:

where the products run over the number of detector layers, N. Although the results are
very similar in the three cases, the likelihood method (case iii) gives slightly better pion
rejection and, as it is also the simplest method, will be employed for the rest of the paper.

network.

lation for the momentum of 2 GeV/c. The curve is a ﬁt to the measured values (triangles). The
star shows the pion eﬃciency extrapolated for six layers.

For each event the probabilities for 1, 2, 3 and 4 chambers were calculated. The resulting
likelihood distributions are shown in Fig. 4.

The pion eﬃciencies for 1, 2, 3, and 4 chambers are shown in Figure 5. Since the mea-
surements of individual chambers are uncorrelated one can perform an exponential ﬁt to
estimate the pion eﬃciency of 6 chambers (star). This corresponds to the expected per-
formance of the ALICE TRD. The value of the pion eﬃciency extrapolated in this way
will be used in the following plots.

3.3 Error Determination

For the described analysis procedure with neural networks it is not straightforward to
assign errors to the measured pion eﬃciencies. A clean, albeit impractical, procedure would
be subdivide the measured events into several samples, calculate the pion eﬃciencies for
each sample and ﬁnally exploit the variation of the results for the error calculation. As
the data size was not large enough for such a procedure, the following approach was used
to estimate the uncertainty.

The data samples were divided into two sets. Pion eﬃciencies were calculated and com-
pared to the eﬃciencies obtained with the whole data sample. The maximum diﬀerence
was used as the error for the pion eﬃciencies.

4 Results and Discussion

4.1 Time-Integrated Signal Analyzed with a NN and the Classical Likelihood Methods

As a ﬁrst step it was tested whether results obtained with classical methods could be
reproduced using a NN. The same network topology as in the analysis described above
was used (for the hidden layers and output layer) to guarantee identical conditions.

Like in the classical one-dimensional likelihood method (LQ method 4 ), which is based
on the total deposited charge, the charge signal was integrated over all time bins and
on three adjacent pads. Thus, the neural network for each chamber has only one input
neuron. The learning parameter η (which is a factor that describes the velocity of the
learning process) 5 was 0.001 and the networks were trained for 1000 epochs. As expected
the results of this method are in good agreement with the results obtained with the LQ
method (see Fig. 6).

A second test, also based on a NN which only considers the integrated deposited charge,
was carried out for a momentum of 2 GeV/c. Here, the same NN topology like in the main
analysis with an identical input layer was used. The position of the diﬀerent input neurons
for each event was randomized, i.e. all information about the position was lost. The NN
could obtain the necessary information for its decision whether a particle was an electron

or a pion only from the sum of all inputs. The networks were trained for 3000 epochs 6 .
The result of this method is, as expected, in good agreement with the LQ and the one
neuron results (also Fig. 6).

4.2 Pion Rejection with Neural Networks

Here, we present the results of the main analysis, the performance of a neural net algorithm
compared to the LQX method 7 . The procedure for this analysis and the used network
topology are described in Section 3. The networks for the single chamber were trained for
3000 epochs.

In Figure 7 the results of this analysis are presented and compared to the results obtained
with the LQX method. The Figure shows that using a NN algorithm the pion eﬃciency
is signiﬁcantly smaller compared to the LQX method leading to an improvement in the
electron/pion separation. For small momenta the improvement nearly reaches a factor of
four. As expected (and shown for the LQX method in previous analyses, e.g. [2]) the pion
eﬃciency increases with higher momenta,thus decreasing the pion rejection factor. This is
expected, given that with increasing momenta pions deposit more charge inside the drift
chambers which makes it more diﬃcult to separate them from electrons.

In Figure 8 the evolution of the pion eﬃciency for diﬀerent electron eﬃciencies for a
momentum of 2 GeV/c is shown. The diﬀerence between NN and LQX increases with
decreasing electron eﬃciency.

4.3 Other Network Topologies

There is a large diﬀerence between the results of NNs with only one input neuron (section
4.1) on the one hand, and the results of NNs used in the main analysis (section 4.2) on
the other hand. Hence, the question arises, how the evolution of the pion eﬃciency from
a value of about 1.4 % to a value of about 0.2 % for a momentum of 2 GeV/c depends
on the time bin resolution presented to the NN. Depending on the chosen resolution the
number of time bins varies. Therefore, the topologies for the input layers diﬀer as well.
The topologies of the hidden layers and the output layer are kept unchanged. The number
of time bins was varied from 1 time bin (3 µs width, the NN with one input neuron) to 30
time bins (100 ns width, the maximum time resolution of the ALICE TRD). The diﬀerent
NNs were trained for between 1000 and 3000 epochs, depending on the number of time
bins.

6 It was necessary to train the NN for a larger number of epochs compared to previous test,
because the input layer was larger and the NN needed more time to adapt.

On the x-axis the number of input neurons (= timebins) is plotted.

Figure 9 summarizes the results of these analyses. It was expected that the more input
neurons were used, the better the performance of the NN algorithm gets.

This is observed in Fig. 9, however, the pion eﬃciency is roughly constant for small number
of neurons. After a decrease between 6 and 10 input neurons, the pion eﬃciency saturates
for a larger number of input neurons as expected. The result for 30 input neurons is not
shown in the graph. It agrees well with the results for 10, 12 and 15 input neurons.

5 Summary

We reported the electron/pion identiﬁcation performance using data measured with pro-
totype drift chambers for the ALICE TRD. Pions and electrons with momenta from 2 to
6 GeV/c were studied to analyse the possibilities of a neural network algorithm for elec-
tron and pion separation. It was shown that NNs improve the pion rejection signiﬁcantly
by a factor larger than 3 for a momentum of 2 GeV/c compared to other methods. The
rejection power was studied with respect to the number of input neurons and the robust-
ness of the method for electron/pion separation for particles with diﬀerent momenta was
examined. The application of the NN method for simulated full physics events in ALICE
TRD is under investigation.

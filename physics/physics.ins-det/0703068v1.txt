Fast automated scanning of OPERA emulsion ﬁlms
G. Sirri a oh behalf of the OPERA Collaboration.

aIstituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, viale Berti Pichat 6/2, 40127 Bologna, Italy

Presented at the 10th Topical Seminar on Innovative Particle and Radiation Detectors, 1-5 October 2006, Siena, Italy.

The use of nuclear emulsions to record tracks of charged particles with an accuracy of better than 1 micron is
possible in large physics experiments thanks to the recent improvements in the industrial production of emulsions
and to the development of fast automated microscopes.

The European Scanning System (ESS) is a fast automatic system developed for the mass scanning of the
/h.

emulsions of the OPERA experiment, which requires microscopes with scanning speeds of about 20 cm
Recent improvements in the technique and measurements with ESS are reported.

1. Introduction

Nuclear emulsions were largely used during the
last century and are connected to many discov-
eries in the early days of nuclear and particle
physics. Since the production and the measure-
ments were carried out manually, the amount
of emulsions used for the experiments was quite
small [1].

Signiﬁcant improvements in the emulsion tech-
nique and the development of fast automated
scanning systems during the last two decades [2,
3,4] have made possible the use of nuclear emul-
sions in large scale experiments like OPERA at
the INFN Gran Sasso Underground Laboratories.
OPERA is a long baseline experiment [5] de-
signed to search for νµ → ντ oscillations in the
parameter range suggested by atmospheric neu-
trino experiments [6,7,8]. The goal is to observe
the appearance of the short-lived τ leptons in
a pure νµ beam produced by the CNGS facility
at CERN [9]. The τ lepton is directly identiﬁed
through its decay topologies which need track po-
sition and angular measurements with accuracies
of ∼ 1 micron and a few milliradiants respectively.

2. Nuclear emulsions. OPERA Target

Nuclear emulsions are made of micro-crystals of
silver halides (AgBr) dispersed in a gelatin layer.
The energy released by ionizing particles to the
crystals, produces a latent image which is stable

in time. A chemical development process reduces
the irradiated grains to metallic Ag. After ﬁxing
and washing to remove undeveloped crystals the
gelatin is transparent; the path of an ionizing par-
ticle is visible as a sequence of black silver grains
about 0.5 µm in size [1].

In order to see the track of a particle in emul-
sion, almost 30 developed grains every 100 µm of
path are necessary. The grains which accidentally
develop are randomly distributed in the emulsion
volume and their concentration should be < 5 in
1000 µm3.

In the OPERA detector, as in other recent ex-
periments, the emulsions are used as thin ﬁlms: a
pair of emulsion layers (44 µm thick) is mounted
on both sides of a plastic base (205 µm thick) [10].
The OPERA detector is a hybrid system con-
sisting of electronic detectors and a massive lead-
emulsion target segmented into ∼ 200, 000 bricks
(Fig. 1).

A brick is a sequence of 56 lead sheets, acting as
target, interleaved with 57 emulsion sheets, acting
as high precision trackers, and satisﬁes the need
of both a large mass and a high precision tracking
capability.1

With the CNGS neutrino beam [9] at its nomi-
nal intensity, ∼ 30 neutrino selected interactions
per day are expected. Therefore, ∼ 2000 emul-
sion sheets per day must be (partially) scanned

1This technique is historically called Emulsion Cloud
Chamber (ECC).

in order to ﬁnd the vertex and analyze the event.
In total, ∼ 6000 cm2 per day have to be analyzed
with a sub-micrometric precision per 5 years of
data taking.

∼ 200, 000 bricks which are sequences of lead and
emulsion sheets.

The ESS (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) is based on the
use of commercial hardware components or devel-
oped in collaboration with specialized companies.

The ESS is able to scan an emulsion volume of 44
µm thickness with a speed of 20 cm2/h. This rep-
resents an improvement of more than an order of
magnitude with respect to the systems developed
in the past. The Japanese S-UTS system uses
a dedicated hardware suitable for point scanning
with a speed of 1.2 s/prediction (∼ 15 min/brick).

Figure 3. A photograph of one of the microscopes
of the European Scanning System.

By adjusting the focal plane of the objective,
the whole 44 µm emulsion thickness is spanned
and a sequence of 15 tomographic images of each
ﬁeld of view, taken at equally spaced depth levels
(3 µm), is obtained. Emulsion images are dig-
itized, converted into a grey scale of 256 levels,
sent to a vision processor board, hosted in the
control workstation, and analyzed to recognize se-
quences of aligned grains (clusters of dark pixels
of given shape and size).

The three-dimensional structure of a track in
an emulsion layer is reconstructed by combining
clusters belonging to images at diﬀerent levels and
searching for geometrical alignments. A linear ﬁt
to these clusters allows the determination of the
track position and angle. After emulsion sheets
alignment, tracks are reconstructed in the entire
brick (Fig. 4).

4. Scanning performances

Several test exposures at pions beams were
performed to estimate the scanning perfor-

3

to be above 90% in the [0, 600] mrad angular
range with resolutions of ∼ 1 µm and ∼ 1 mrad
for vertical tracks.

The ESS has reached the speed of ∼ 20 cm2/h
in an emulsion volume 44 µm thick. This rep-
resents an improvement of more than an order of
magnitude with respect to the systems developed
in the past. The scanning performances satisfy
the requirements of the OPERA experiment.

About 20 ESSs have been installed in European
laboratories collaborating in the OPERA experi-
ment. Five more have been installed at the Gran
Sasso Laboratory (LNGS).

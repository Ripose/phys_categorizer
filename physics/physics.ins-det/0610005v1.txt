1. INTRODUCTION

This reporta presents recent results 1 on
track reconstruction and alignment with the
silicon tracker of the CMS experiment at the
LHC, obtained with a full detector simula-
tion. After an overview of the layout of the
tracker and its material budget, the base-
line algorithm for track reconstruction is dis-
cussed. The performance of the track re-
construction and its dependence on misalign-
ment is shown. The concept for alignment
of the CMS tracker, using a laser alignment
system as well as three diﬀerent track-based
alignment algorithms, is presented.

2. THE CMS SILICON

TRACKER

The CMS Silicon Tracker (Figure 1) is one of
the main components of the CMS experiment
at the LHC. It consists of ∼ 15000 silicon
strip and pixel sensors covering an active area
of ∼ 200 m2 within the tracker volume of
24.4 m3. The full tracker has a radius of
∼ 110 cm and covers pseudorapidity values
up to η = 2.4.

The Barrel strip detector consists of 4
inner (TIB) and 6 outer (TOB) layers (Fig-
ure 2). The ﬁrst two layers in TIB and

aPoster presented at ICHEP 2006, Moscow

TOB use double-sided sensors. The Endcap
strip detector is made of 3 inner (TID) and 9
outer (TEC) disks (rings 1,2 and 5 are dou-
ble sided). The Pixel detector consists of 3
barrel layers at r = 4.4, 7.3 and 10.2 cm, and
of two endcap disks.

The Strip Sensors consist of 512 or 768
strips with a pitch of 80 . . . 200 µm Their res-
olution in the precise coordinate is in the
range 20 . . . 50 µm. The Pixel sensors are
made of pixels of size 100(rφ) x 150(z) µm2
with a resolution of 10 . . . 15 µm. The mod-
ules are mounted on carbon-ﬁber structures
and housed inside a temperature controlled
outer support tube. The operating tempera-
ture will be around −20oC. Figure 3 shows
two recent photographs from the integration
of tracker components.

3. TRACKER MATERIAL

BUDGET

The CMS tracker includes both sensitive
volumes and non-sensitive ones. Since the
tracker requires a large amount of
low-
voltage power, a large amount of heat needs
to be dissipated. Therefore, a large frac-
tion of the tracker material consists of elec-
trical cables and cooling services. Other non-
sensitive parts include support structures,
electronics, the beam-pipe, and the thermal
screen outside the tracker.

4. TRACK

RECONSTRUCTION

Track reconstruction in a dense environment
needs an eﬃcient search for hits during the
pattern recognition stage and a fast propa-
gation of trajectory candidates. In the CMS
tracker, these tasks beneﬁt from the arrange-
ment of the sensitive modules in practically
hermetic layers as well as from the almost
constant four Tesla magnetic ﬁeld provided
by the CMS solenoid magnet. Since the typ-
ical step length for the propagation of track
parameters is of the order of the distance be-
tween two layers, a helical track model is ad-
equate.

For reconstruction purposes the detailed
distribution of passive material as used in
the simulation is replaced by an attribution
of material to layers. This model simpliﬁes
the estimation of energy loss and multiple
scattering, which can be done at the position
of the sensitive elements without additional
propagation steps.

The baseline algorithm for track recon-
struction 2 in CMS is the Combinatorial
Kalman Filter. After the tracker hits have
been reconstructed (clustering and position
estimation), track reconstruction proceeds
through the following four stages:

• Trajectory Seeding
• Pattern Recognition
• Trajectory Cleaning
• Track ﬁtting and smoothing

Fig. 3. Photographs from the integration of tracker
components. Left: TEC Integration; Right: One half
of TIB/TID completed.

In the following subsections, these steps

are explained in more detail.

As a result, the tracker material bud-
get can exceed the equivalent of one radia-
tion length for certain regions of η, which
aﬀects hadron and electron reconstruction.
The decomposition of the tracker material
in terms of radiation lengths and interaction
lengths versus η for the diﬀerent subdetec-
tors is shown in Figure 4.

4.1. Trajectory Seeding

Seed generation provides initial trajectory
candidates for the full track reconstruction.
A seed must deﬁne initial trajectory param-
eters and errors. Hence, ﬁve parameters are
needed to start trajectory building. There-
fore, the standard trajectory seeds in the
CMS tracker are constructed from pairs of

hits in the pixel detector and a vertex con-
straint. The pixel detector is well suited for
seeding due to its low occupancy, its prox-
imity to the beam spot and due to the 2D
measurement capability in both rφ and rz.
The seed ﬁnding eﬃciency is > 99%.

Alternatively to the baseline seeding, a
seeding using the innermost layers of the
strip tracker has also been implemented, to
be used for example at the start-up when
the pixel detector will not yet be installed.
In addition, external seeds provided by the
calorimeter or the muon detector can be
used.

4.2. Pattern Recognition

Trajectory building is based on a combina-
torial Kalman ﬁlter method. The ﬁlter pro-
ceeds iteratively from the seed layer, starting
from a coarse estimate of the track parame-
ters provided by the seed, and including the
information of the successive detection lay-
ers one by one. With each included layer,
the track parameters are better constrained.
In the extrapolation of the trajectory from
layer to layer, the eﬀects of energy loss and

multiple scattering are accounted for.

Trajectory candidates are added for each
compatible hit (including an additional tra-
jectory without a measured hit in order to
account for ineﬃciencies), and the trajec-
tory parameters are updated according to the
Kalman ﬁlter formalism. The best trajectory
candidates are grown in parallel up to the
outermost layers.

4.3. Trajectory Cleaning

Ambiguities in track ﬁnding arise because
a given track may be reconstructed starting
from diﬀerent seeds, or because a given seed
may result in more than one trajectory can-
didate. These ambiguities must be resolved
in order to avoid double counting of tracks.
The ambiguity resolution is based on the
fraction of hits that are shared between two
trajectories.
the ﬁrst
time on all trajectories resulting from a sin-
gle seed, and the second time on the complete
set of track candidates from all seeds.

It is applied twice:

4.4. Track ﬁtting and smoothing

For each trajectory, the building stage re-
sults in a collection of hits and an estimate of
the track parameters. However, the full in-
formation is only available at the last hit of
the trajectory, and the estimate may be bi-
ased by constraints applied during the seed-
ing stage. Therefore the trajectory is reﬁtted
using a least squares approach, implemented
as a combination of a standard Kalman ﬁlter
and smoother. While the ﬁlter runs inside-
out, in the smoothing step a second ﬁlter is
run outside-in. In both cases, the initial co-
variance matrix of the track parameters is
scaled by a large factor to avoid possible bi-
ases. At each hit the updated parameters of
the smoothing ﬁlter are combined with the
predicted parameters of the ﬁrst ﬁlter. The
combination yields optimal estimates of the
track parameters at the surface of each hit.

5. TRACKING

PERFORMANCE

5.1. Track ﬁnding eﬃciency

The eﬃciency for reconstructing single tracks
with the combinatorial Kalman ﬁlter has
been estimated using samples of muons and
pions with transverse momenta of 1, 10 and
100 GeV. The results are shown in Figure 5.
Here, reconstructed tracks are required to
have at least 8 hits and a minimum pT of
0.8 GeV. A track is deemed to be success-
fully reconstructed if it shares more than 50%
of the hits with a simulated track.

The global track ﬁnding eﬃciency for
muons is excellent, exceeding 98% over most
of the tracker acceptance. The drop of eﬃ-
ciency in the region |η| < 0.1 is due to the
gaps between the sensors in the ladders of
the pixel detector at z = 0. At high η, the
drop in eﬃciency is mainly due to the lack
of coverage by the two pairs of pixel endcap
disks.

For hadrons, the eﬃciency is between 75
and 95%, depending on momentum and η.

It is lower compared with the eﬃciency for
muons because the hadrons interact with the
tracker material.

5.2. Resolution

Five parameters are chosen to describe a
track: The transverse and longitudinal im-
pact parameters d0 and z0, the angular pa-
rameters φ and cot θ, and the transverse mo-
mentum pT . The resolutions in d0 and in pT
are shown in Figure 6.

At high momentum, the impact param-
eter resolution is fairly constant and is dom-
inated by the hit resolution of the ﬁrst hit in
the pixel detector. At lower momenta, the d0
resolution is progressively degraded by multi-
ple scattering, until the latter becomes dom-
inant.

The transverse momentum resolution is
around 1 . . . 2% up to a pseudorapidity of
|η| < 1.6 at high momentum. For higher
values of |η| the lever arm of the measure-
ment is reduced. The degradation around
|η| = 1.0 is due to the gap between the bar-
rel and the endcap disks. At pT = 100 GeV,
the tracker material accounts for 20 . . . 30%
of the transverse momentum resolution. At
lower momenta, the resolution is dominated
by multiple scattering and its distribution re-
ﬂects the amount of material traversed by the
track.

6. IMPACT OF

MISALIGNMENT

The large number of independent silicon sen-
sors and their excellent intrinsic resolution of
10 . . . 50 µm make the alignment of the CMS
strip and pixel trackers a complex of chal-
lenging task. The residual alignment uncer-
tainties should not lead to a signiﬁcant degra-
dation of the intrinsic tracker resolution. For
example, to achieve a desired precision on
the measurement of the W boson mass of
15 . . . 20 MeV, the momentum scale has to
be known to an accuracy of 0.02 to 0.025%,

which implies the absolute detector positions
to be known with a precision of better than
10 µm in the rφ plane. Misalignment will
degrade the track parameter resolution and
hence aﬀect the physics performance of the
tracker, for instance the mass resolution of
resonances and b-tagging and vertexing per-
formances.

In order to assess the impact of misalign-
ment on the tracking and vertexing perfor-
mance in general, but also in speciﬁc physics
channels in particular, a realistic model of
misalignment eﬀects 3 has been implemented

in the standard CMS software, where the
displacement of detector modules is imple-
mented at reconstruction level using a dedi-
cated software tool which is able to move and
rotate all tracker parts (individual sensors as
well as composed structures such as whole
layers or disks). In addition, the position er-
ror assigned to a reconstructed hit can be
increased by adding an additional error that
reﬂects the size of the assumed misalignment
(alignment position error).

Two default misalignment

scenarios

have been implemented in the software:

able level using tracks. For the strip
detector it is assumed that no track-
based alignment is possible due to
insuﬃcient high pT track statistics,
so that only survey information is
available.
In addition, the LAS
would provide constraints on the po-
sitions of the larger structures of the
strip tracker.

• Long Term Scenario:

It is as-
sumed that after the ﬁrst few fb−1
of data have been accumulated, a
ﬁrst complete track-based alignment
down to the sensor level has been
carried out, resulting in an overall
alignment uncertainty of the strip
tracker of ∼ 20 µm.

position error is taken into account. If not,
the eﬃciency is signiﬁcantly reduced, which
is illustrated in Figure 7 for the short term
scenario. The dip in the distribution in the
range 1.2 < |η| < 2.0 is due to tracks pass-
ing through the TID, which has large align-
ment uncertainties due to the missing laser
alignment system. For |η| > 2.2 the inclusion
of the alignment position error does not im-
prove the eﬃciency due to the large track ex-
trapolation uncertainties involved in the very
forward direction.

7. ALIGNMENT OF THE CMS

TRACKER

The alignment strategy for the CMS tracker
forsees that in addition to the knowledge of
the positions of the modules from measure-
ments at construction time, the alignment
will proceed by two means: A Laser Align-
ment System (LAS) and track-based align-
ment.

7.1. Laser Alignment System

The placement uncertainties used in the
scenarios are listed in Table 1. As an illustra-
tion of the implementation and use of these
misalignment scenarios, Figure 7 shows the
eﬀects of misalignment on track-ﬁnding eﬃ-
ciency and transverse momentum resolution
for single muons 4. The track ﬁnding eﬃ-
ciency is close to unity for |η| < 2 for all mis-
alignment scenarios, provided the alignment

The Laser Alignment System uses infrared
laser beams to monitor the positions of se-
lected detector modules of the strip tracker
and of special alignment sensors in the muon
system. Therefore it operates globally on
the larger tracker composite structures (TIB,
TOB, TEC disks) and cannot determine the
position of individual modules. The goal of
the LAS is to provide alignment informa-

the alignment uncertainty is not accounted for, the eﬃciency is signiﬁcantly degraded. The pT resolution
deteriorates signiﬁcantly with misalignment, in particular for the short-term scenario.

Hz, a full snapshot of the tracker structure
can be taken in a few seconds. The LAS is
foreseen to operate both in dedicated runs
and during physics data taking, so that the
alignment can be monitored on a continuous
basis.

measurements of the tracker substructures at
the level of 100 µm, which is mandatory for
pattern recognition and for the High Level
Trigger. In addition possible structure move-
ments can be monitored at the level of 10 µm.
The LAS design is illustrated in Figure 8.
Each tracker endcap (TEC) uses in total 16
beams distributed in φ and crossing all 9
TEC disks, which are used for the internal
alignment of the TEC disks. The other 8
beams are foreseen to align TIB, TOB and
TEC with respect to each other. Finally,
there is a link to the muon system. As laser
pulses are ﬁred with a rate of around 100

7.2. Track Based Alignment

Track-based alignment was shown to be the
optimal method for the alignment of large
tracking detectors in previous experiments.
However, it represents a major challenge at
CMS because the number of degrees of free-
dom involved is very large: Considering 3+3
translational and rotational degrees of free-
dom for each of the ∼ 15000 modules leads
to O(100, 000) alignment parameters, which
have to be determined with a precision of
∼ 10 µm. Moreover, the full covariance ma-
trix is of size O(1010).

In CMS,

three diﬀerent

track-based
alignment algorithms are considered, some
having been established at other experi-
ments, others newly developed.
In the fol-
lowing, the main features and initial results
of using these algorithms in CMS are sum-
marized.

7.2.1. Kalman Filter

A method for global alignment using charged
tracks can be derived from the Kalman ﬁl-
ter. The method is iterative, so that the
alignment parameters are updated after each
track.
It can be formulated in such a way
that no large matrices have to be inverted 5.
In order to achieve a global alignment the up-
date is not restricted to the detector elements
that are crossed by the track, but can be ex-
tended to those elements that have signiﬁ-
cant correlations with the ones in the current
track. This requires some bookkeeping, but
keeps the computational load to an accept-
able level.
It is possible to use prior infor-
mation about the alignment obtained from
mechanical survey measurements as well as
from laser alignment. The algorithm can also
be extended to deal with kinematically con-
strained track pairs (originating from parti-
cle decays).

The algorithm has been implemented in
the CMS software and studied in two small
subsets of the silicon tracker: A telescope-
like section of the inner and outer barrel,
and a wheel-like subset of the inner barrel,
consisting of 156 modules in 4 layers. The
tracks used were simulated single muons with
pT = 100 GeV. Random misalignment with
a standard deviation of σ = 100 µm was ap-
plied to the local x and y positions of the
modules. Results from the alignment of the

wheel-like setup are shown in Figure 9.
It
shows the evolution of the diﬀerences be-
tween true and estimated x-shifts for layers
1 and 2. A total of 100 000 tracks were pro-
cessed. As can be seen, the speed of conver-
gence depends on the layer. More results can
be found in 5.

7.2.2. Millepede-II
Millepede 6 is a well established and robust
program package for alignment which has
been used successfully at other experiments,
for example at H1, CDF, LHCb and others.
Being a non-iterative method,
it has been
shown that it can improve the alignment pre-
cision considerably with respect to other al-
gorithms.

Millepede is a linear least-squares algo-
rithm which is fast, accurate and can take
into account correlations among parameters.
In the least-squares ﬁt local track parameters
and global alignment parameters are ﬁtted
simultaneously. The solution for the align-
ment parameters is obtained from a matrix
equation for the global parameters only. For
N alignment parameters this requires the in-
version of a N xN matrix. However, this
method can only be used up to N ∼ 10000
due to CPU and memory constraints. The
alignment of the CMS tracker exceeds this
limit by one order of magnitude. Therefore,
a new version Millepede-II 7 was developed,

which oﬀers diﬀerent solution methods, and
is applicable for N much larger than 10000.
In Millepede-II, in addition to the matrix in-
version and a diagonalization method, a new
method for the solution of very large matrix
equations is implemented. This minimum
residual method applicable for sparse matri-
ces determines a good solution by iteration
in acceptable time even for large N .

Millepede-II has been interfaced to the
CMS software and the alignment of parts of
the CMS tracker has been carried out using
diﬀerent scenarios 7. As an example, Fig-
ure 10 (left) shows hit residuals in rφ for the
new iterative method. Each individual sen-
sor of the tracker was misaligned. The align-
ment procedure was carried out in the barrel
region (|η| < 0.9) of the strip tracker using
1.8 million Z 0 → µ+µ− events. The pixel
layers and the outermost barrel layer were
kept ﬁxed, resulting in ∼ 8400 alignment pa-
rameters. The convergence is very good, and
the results obtained are identical to those us-
ing the matrix inversion method, but the new
method being faster by about three orders of
magnitude.

time as a function of the number of align-
ment parameters for the diagonalization and
matrix inversion methods as well as for the
new method used in Millepede-II. It can be
seen that Millepede-II is expected to be ca-

pable to solve the full CMS tracker alignment
problem within reasonable CPU time.

7.2.3. HIP Algorithm

An iterative alignment algorithm using the
Hits and Impact Points (HIP) method was
developed in 8. It is able to determine the
alignment of individual sensors by minimiz-
ing a local χ2 function depending on the
alignment parameters, constructed from the
track-hit residuals on the sensor. Correla-
tions between diﬀerent sensors are not ex-
plicitly included, but taken care of implicitly
by iterating the method, which involves con-
secutive cycles of calculating the alignment
parameters and reﬁtting the tracks. The
algorithm is computationally light because
no inversion of large matrices is involved.
An alternative implementation of the algo-
rithm is designed to align composite detec-
tor structures for a common translation and
rotation 9, for example pixel ladders or lay-
ers. The composite alignment involves only a
small number of parameters, and therefore a
rather small number of tracks is suﬃcient to
carry out alignment already in the beginning
of data taking.

The HIP algorithm has been used in 9 for
the alignment of the pixel barrel modules us-
ing the First Data Taking misalignment sce-
nario (see section 6). The pixel endcaps and
the strip tracker are not misaligned. The

modules with a precision of 10 µm, so that
the intrinsic resolution of the silicon modules
is not signiﬁcantly degraded. To achieve this
goal, CMS has implemented three diﬀerent
track-based alignment algorithms. Results
from ﬁrst alignment studies applying these
algorithms to parts of the CMS tracker in
simulation are very encouraging.

8. CONCLUSIONS

References

The CMS silicon tracker is a complex device,
consisting of more than 15000 individual sil-
icon sensors. The track reconstruction per-
formance is very good, although the track
reconstruction eﬃciency for low momentum
charged hadrons is aﬀected by the signiﬁcant
amount of tracker material.

Alignment of the tracker is a challeng-
ing task, and involves a laser alignment sys-
tem as well as track-based alignment with the
goal to determine the positions of all detector

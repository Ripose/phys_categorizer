In 2002, the ATHENA collaboration reported the creation and detection of cold
(∼15 K) antihydrogen atoms 1. The observation was based on the complete re-
construction of antihydrogen annihilations, simultaneous and spatially correlated
annihilations of an antiproton and a positron. Annihilation byproducts are mea-
sured with a cylindrically symmetric detector system consisting of two layers of
double sided Si-micro-strip modules that are surrounded by 16 rows of 12 pure CsI
crystals (13×17.5×17 mm3). This paper gives a brief overview of the experiment,
the detector system, and event reconstruction.

1. Introduction

Anithydrogen (H) experiments are aimed at precisely testing CPT invari-
ance and measuring the gravitational force between matter and antimatter
with the simplest bound state of antiparticles. Many experimental ad-
vances towards accomplishing these goals have been made 1,2,3,4, in fact a
little more than 1 year ago the ATHENA 1 and ATRAP 4 collaborations re-
ported the production and detection of cold H. Both of these collaborations
employ similar techniques to create cold H, though use diﬀerent methods
to detect the produced H. This article begins with a short overview of
the procedure for creating cold H, though mainly focuses on the ATHENA
detector system and the event reconstruction.

2. Creating cold H
Cold H has been produced by combining antiprotons (p) with a cold (∼ 15
K) positron (e+) plasma (ρ ∼108 cm−3). CERN’s Antiproton decelerator
(AD) delivers ps to the 4 AD experiments: ACE, ASACUSA, ATHENA
and ATRAP. ATHENA catches and cools a small fraction (∼ 0.1%) of the
p beam (n ¯p ≈ 107) from an AD spill (∼ 100 s). Prior to capture, ps travel
through a thin degrader foil to further reduce their energy. From the energy
distribution of ps after the degrader foil, those in the tail on the low energy
side are reﬂected by a −5 kV potential wall and then axially contained with
another −5 kV wall that is upstream from the reﬂecting wall and raised
after the ps pass. Radial conﬁnement near the axis is achieved with a 3 T
magnetic ﬁeld that is parallel to the electric ﬁeld produced by the catching
trap electrodes. In the catching trap ps cool to the ambient temperature
(∼ 15 K) of the surrounding environment via Coulomb interactions with
previously trapped electrons, which cool via synchrotron radiation. In par-
allel with the p catching and cooling process, about 108 e+s from a 22Na
source are collected in a positron accumulator. The two antiparticle species
are then transferred to and combined in a nested Penning trap 5, in which
outer negative potential wells conﬁne the ps while an inner positive poten-
tial well conﬁnes the e+s. In the nested Penning trap ps loose energy as
they traverse the inner e+ plasma. With some probability, ps individually
combine with e+s to form H, via three body recombination or radiative re-
combination. The neutral H atoms travel freely though the charged particle
conﬁning electromagnetic ﬁelds and annihilate on the Au plated Al elec-
trodes of the trap. This annihilation process may be viewed as two separate
process, correlated both spatially and in time: an positron–electron annihi-

lation usually e+e−→ γγ; and an antiproton–nucleon annihilation typically
pN→5π, on average 3 charged and 2 neutral pions6,7. Surrounding the H
formation region, the nested Penning trap, is a cylindrically symmetric de-
tector system which has been designed to identify H–annihilations. A more
detailed description of the catching, cooling and combining processes may
be found in 8.

3. ATHENA’s H detector

ATHENA’s antihydrogen detector9, Fig. 1, is composed of two layers of sil-
icon micro–strip/pad modules and a barrel of pure CsI crystals. The detec-
tor was designed to reconstruct charged particles from the pN–annihilation
with information from the two layers of silicon micro–strip/pad modules,
and 511 keV photons from e+e−–annihilations with the CsI crystals. Both
the silicon layers and crystals are situated in a radially compact region, ∆r
< 3 cm, spatially constrained by the inner trap electrodes and outer mag-
net. Environmental conditions is this region require the detector to operate
in a 3 T magnetic ﬁeld and at a temperature of 130 K.

Each of the two silicon layers consists of 16 identical modules oriented in
cylindrical geometries (rin ≈ 4 cm and rout ≈ 5 cm). Two 8.16 × 1.9
cm2 double side sensors, two 128 channel readout chips and a silicon sup-
port/bus compose each module, as shown in Fig. 2. On the p-side of a

sensor 128 strips are read out with a pitch of 139 µm. While the n–side is
divided into 64 pads, 1.25 × 18 mm2. In order to match the thermal ex-
pansion coeﬃcients between the sensors and the support over a wide range
of operating temperatures (80 – 300 K), the sensors are glued to a silicon
support structure/bus. The 128 line bus transfers signals from the pads
to the front end electronics. The strips on the 2 sensors are wire bonded
in series, as shown in Fig. 2. A total of 128 strip channels and 128 pad
channels are fed into the two readout chips on the module. Each input
channel on the readout chip contains a pre–amp, a fast shaper (∼100 ns),
a discriminator and a slow (∼2 µs) shaper. Signals from the pre–amps
feed both the slow and the fast shapers. The pulse height discriminators
compare the fast shaped signals to a common trigger–threshold. The out-
puts of 128 discriminators are combined with a logical “or” into one trigger
output, so each module provides one strip and one pad side trigger signal.
Signals from the slow shapers are sampled in the chip and multiplexed to a
single analog output. These analog signals are transferred through external
repeater cards to 10–bit VME ADC units (CAEN V550). See reference 9
for further details.

Clusters are found from ADC information of the pads and strips. Typi-
cally 3 adjacent strips and 1 pad provide signals over a threshold level. Fig.
3a illustrates the response on the pads and the strips from a minimum–
ionizing charged particle. The physical position of a cluster is decoded
from the module number, and strips and pads that ﬁre. Multiple clusters
on one module are resolved by requiring the sum of ADC counts on the
strip and pad sides to be correlated8. This correlation between the sum of
the ADCs on the pad and strip sides is shown in Fig. 3b.

Trajectories of charged particles from pN–annihilations are recon-
structed from the cluster information of one inner and outer module. With
the positions of only two clusters, the helical trajectories of independent
charged particles are not uniquely deﬁned. For this reason straight line ﬁts

are used to describe the trajectories. The position of the pN–annihilation
is found by minimizing the χ2 of functions that describe the crossing posi-
tion of multiple trajectories in various planes8. This method yields a vertex
resolution of σ ≈ 4 mm. A more detailed description of cluster, track and
vertex reconstruction may be found in reference 8.

4. Pure CsI crystals and selecting 511 keV photon

candidates

Pure CsI crystals, read by avalanche photo diodes (APD), are used to iden-
tify 511 keV photon candidates, stemming from e+e−–annihilations. Pure
CsI crystals have the property that the light yield increases as the tem-
perature decreases 10,11. This is an advantage in the ATHENA apparatus
where T = 130 K.

The barrel of crystals (r ≈ 5 cm, l = 16.2 cm) is arranged in 16 rows of
12 crystals (13×17.5×17 mm3). The APDs of each row are readout with the
a single chip (the same chip is used for the readout of the silicons sensors).
Also as for the readout of the silicon modules, the slow shaped analog sig-
nals are transferred through external repeater cards to 10–bit VME ADC
units (CAEN V550). These ADC values are linearly correlated to the en-
ergy deposited in the crystals (below ≈ 2 MeV). Crystal calibrations are
performed on data from e+ only runs, in which the charged particle back-
ground is low and 511 keV photons are abundant. The 511 keV photon

conversion peak in the ADC spectrum of each crystal is ﬁt with a Gaussian
function to determine the ADC value that corresponds to an energy of 511
keV, the resolution (FWHM ≈ 24%) and the window for selecting 511 keV
candidates (−2 to 3 σ), as shown in Fig. 4.

5. Signatures of H production

ATHENA has shown the capability to fully reconstruct H–annihilations,
golden events, with information of the pN–annihilation vertex from the
silicon modules and 511 keV photon candidates from the crystals. A golden
event is deﬁned as an event with two 511 keV photon candidates emerging
back–to–back from a reconstructed pN–annihilation vertex. One additional
constraint on the topology is that photon candidates are only considered
in crystals which do not lie in the path of a charged particle or in the eight
neighboring crystals. Golden events are identiﬁed with the distribution of
the opening angle of 511 keV photons measured from the pN–annihilation
vertex. The enhancement of counts in the opening angle distribution near
cos (θγγ) = −1 (back–to–back) statistically signiﬁes the presence of golden
events, as shown in Fig. 5. One consequence of this compelling signature
of H formation is its low reconstruction eﬃciency (∼0.25% for cos(θγγ) <
−0.95) that is mainly due to the detection eﬃciency of a photon in the
crystals (∼20%). However, it should be noted that it is not necessary to
fully reconstruct events to study the properties of H production. Other
signatures which have a higher eﬃciencies, though a lower purity, are also

utilized. In reference 12 it has been shown that 65% of all reconstructed
pN–annihilation vertices in cold mixing data are associated with H atoms.

data sets refer to e+ plasma temperatures of approximately 15 K and 3500 K, respec-
tively.

Current investigations which use a convolution of signatures to study
the properties of H production include the temperature dependence on
the e+ plasma13 and the n–states populated during H formation. These
and other ongoing measurements will improve our understanding of cold
H production, and ultimately aid future experiments that test CPT and
measure the gravitational acceleration between matter and antimatter.

Abstract

A large volume TPC is a leading candidate for the central tracking detector at a
future high energy linear collider. To improve the resolution a new readout based on
micro-pattern gas detectors is being developed. Measurements of the spatial resolu-
tion of cosmic-ray tracks in a GEM TPC are presented. We ﬁnd that the resolution
suﬀers if the readout pads are too wide with respect to the charge distribution at
6 mm2
the readout plane due to insuﬃcient charge sharing. For narrow pads of 2
we measure a resolution of 100 µm at short drift distances in the absence of an
axial magnetic ﬁeld. The dependence of the spatial resolution as a function of drift
distance allows the determination of the underlying electron statistics. Our results
show that the present technique uses about half the statistical power available from
the number of primary electrons. The track angle eﬀect is observed as expected.

1 Introduction

The time projection chamber (TPC) [1,2] has been a mainstay of large particle
detectors since its initial concept in the 1970’s. The traditional TPC has an

end cap detector that uses anode wires for ampliﬁcation of the signal. When
operated in an axial magnetic ﬁeld, this leads to an E × B eﬀect [3] which
signiﬁcantly degrades the resolution of the TPC. Proposals to readout TPC
signals without the use of anode wires have been suggested [4, 5] in the past.
The recent development and success of micro pattern gas detectors (MPGD)
such as the µMegas [6] and the GEM [7,8] has renewed interest in this solution.

The advantages of MPGD detectors are that they require less mass to con-
struct, should not have any E × B eﬀect, naturally suppress positive ion feed-
back and allow more freedom in the shape and orientation of the readout pads.
In addition the signals are faster, potentially improving the double track res-
olution in drift time. In the case of MPGDs, the signal on the readout pads
can be a direct signal or an induced signal. The advantage of direct signals
is that their amplitude is larger and the signal is more conﬁned, thus poten-
tially improving the spatial double track resolution. The disadvantage of the
conﬁned signal is that the pads need to be much narrower, on the order of
the width of the ionization charge distribution, which increases the number of
channels and thus the cost. In the case of GEMs the ionization charge can be
spread naturally in the gaps between the GEMs and readout pads. It is also
possible to use the induced signal [9, 10] which has a wider spread than the
direct signal, but a reduced amplitude.

GEM ampliﬁcation with pad type readout planes has been shown to give
excellent spatial resolution for point sources, such as X-rays converting in
a gas [11], which is useful for medical applications, where the pad size can
be arbitrarily small to give the required resolution. In the case of a large
scale experiment using a TPC, such as the proposed TESLA detector, the
pad size determines the number of channels and thus the cost; in that case
it is important to make the pad size as large as possible consistent with the
resolution required.

In earlier studies [10], using a double GEM ampliﬁcation stage, we determined
the point resolution, s, that can be achieved for X-rays converting in the gas us-
ing the direct charge distribution near the edge of hexagonal pads (s
70 µm)
∼
and the induced charge distribution near the middle of pads (s
80 µm). A
subsequent study [12] with cosmic rays and a small TPC with an end cap
5 mm2 rectangular pads showed that
detector with 5 staggered rows of 2.5
these pads produced an adequate track resolution using the direct charge.

∼

In this paper we examine the resolution that can be achieved using a double
GEM ampliﬁcation stage and a rectangular staggered pad readout scheme us-
ing the direct charge. In particular we examine the eﬀect of the pad width and
length on the spatial resolution and attempt to gain a better understanding of
the phenomena that aﬀect the resolution. For this purpose we measured the
spatial resolution as a function of several diﬀerent quantities, including three

2

diﬀerent pad sizes and local position across a pad, two gases, drift distance,
crossing angle, and signal amplitude.

The two gases used were P10 (Ar(90):CH4(10)), a fast gas with large diﬀusion,
and Ar(90):CO2(10), a slow gas with relatively small diﬀusion, operated at a
voltage below the peak velocity. The diﬀerent diﬀusion properties allowed
us to study the eﬀect of pad size relative to the width of the direct charge
distribution arriving at the pads, and to simulate, with the ArCO2 mixture,
reduced diﬀusion as would be present with a P10 type gas in a magnetic ﬁeld.

2 Experimental setup

The test TPC used for these measurements is housed in a cylindrical pressure
vessel ﬁlled with P10 or ArCO2 gas at atmospheric pressure. The TPC has
8 cm2. The drift
a maximum drift length of 15 cm and an active area of 8
ﬁeld of 138 V/cm is established by a series of thin window frame electrodes
located between the cathode plane at the far end and the readout end plane
at the other end of the TPC. A charged particle crossing the drift region will
ionize the gas; the released electrons drift to the end plane where they are
ampliﬁed and detected on a readout PCB. While drifting the charge cloud
gets wider due to transverse diﬀusion, an eﬀect that would be reduced in an
axial magnetic ﬁeld.

×

We use a double GEM structure for ampliﬁcation with a gap of 2.4 mm be-
tween the ﬁrst and the second GEM. The voltage diﬀerence across this transfer
gap is 653 V resulting in a ﬁeld of 2.7 kV/cm. The induction gap between the
second GEM and the readout board is 5.4 mm wide with a voltage diﬀerence
of 1783 V and a ﬁeld of 3.3 kV/cm. The transfer and the induction gaps were
purposely large to diﬀuse the electron cloud and thus spread the signal over
more than one readout pad.

The GEMs were made from 50 µm thick kapton foil coated with copper on
90 µm at the surface are arranged
both sides. The holes with a diameter of
in a hexagonal pattern with a spacing of dhex = 140 µm. The voltage across
the GEMs is 357 V each. The eﬀective gain is estimated to be about 5000.

The readout-pad layout shown in Figure 1 consists of 192 pads which are
reduced to 64 readout channels via multiplexing. The pads in the outer rows
5.08 mm large; in the test row 5 the pads are
(1,2,4,7,9,10) are 2.54 mm
2.032 mm

6.096 mm large and in row 6 they are 3.048 mm
large. Rows 3 and 8 consist of wide pads used for ﬁltering. The outer pads in
rows 1–4 and 7-10 are multiplexed to give one veto channel on the left and
right side, respectively.

We use a right-handed coordinate system with the x-coordinate horizontal
and the y-coordinate pointing upwards; the z-coordinate corresponds to the
drift distance with z = 0 at the ﬁrst GEM. The azimuthal angle φ and the
polar angle θ are measured with respect to the y-axis.

The signals are read out via ALEPH TPC wire preampliﬁers [13] and 64
channels of 200 MHz, 8 bit FADCs made by the University of Montreal. For
data acquisition we use the MIDAS [14] system.

A three layer scintillation counter telescope is used to trigger on cosmic-ray
tracks. One scintillator counter is placed above the TPC and two below, sep-
arated by a 10 cm thick layer of lead. The
19 cm width of the counters and
40 cm between the two outer counters deﬁnes the acceptance
the distance of
coverage in z.

3 Theory

The observed width 1 of the track, σtrack, which is the standard deviation of
the charge cloud perpendicular to the track, is determined by two components,
the spread associated with the readout system σ0 and the transverse diﬀusion
depending on the drift distance z:

where CD =
2Dt/ν is the 1-dimensional diﬀusion coeﬃcient given by the
transverse diﬀusion constant Dt and the drift velocity ν. In a magnetic ﬁeld
Dt(B) = Dt(0)/(1 + ω2 τ 2), thus resulting in a reduced transverse diﬀusion.
The contribution σ0 is composed of several parts. The ﬁrst term originates from
the hexagonal pattern structure of the GEM depending on the hole distance
dhex. For our geometry σhex is estimated to be
50 µm. The second term,
σintern, results from diﬀusion between the GEMs and the readout pads. For the

The standard deviation σx of the charge cloud distribution across a row of
pads also includes the crossing angle eﬀect σφ depending on the track angle φ
and is given by:

σD = CD √z/ cos φ
σφ = L/√12 tan φ .

The factor 1/ cos φ in the transverse diﬀusion term σD reﬂects the projection
of the charge distribution onto the x-axis. The crossing angle eﬀect comes from
the spread of x(y) for a track with an angle φ. Projected onto the x axis this
leads to a rectangular function of total width L tan φ, where L is the length of
the pad. The standard deviation for such a rectangular uniform distribution
is given by σφ.

The observed x-resolution sx reﬂects the precision with which the mean of the
charge distribution can be determined and hence has additional factors from
statistics:

Most contributions depend on the number of electrons nt produced by the ion-
izing particle. Some of these electrons stem from secondary ionization. They
are therefore correlated forming ncl clusters. The number of electrons and clus-
L/ cos φ,
ters created across a row of pads is Nt = nt ∗
respectively. For example for Argon ncl = 24.3/cm and nt = 94/cm [15].

L/ cos φ and Ncl = ncl ∗

All components of s0 depend on the signal amplitude. The eﬀect from the GEM
structure shex is reduced by the number of holes across the pad that contribute
to the ampliﬁcation of the signal. The eﬀect from internal diﬀusion sintern is
strongly reduced due to the high gain. Contributions from electronic noise,
calibration errors and limitations due to insuﬃcient charge sharing between
the pads are included in sother.

The eﬀect from transverse diﬀusion depends on the eﬀective number of elec-
trons N eﬀ
Nt, which includes a reduction factor R. The crossing angle
cl = (Ncl)ǫ. Following the

4 Reconstruction

The analysis package is based on Fortran f95 code [17]. In a calibration run
pedestals and pulse fall times tfall as well as the relative gain are determined for
each readout channel. The time T 0 and the amplitude of the signals are deter-
mined from the pedestal subtracted ADC spectrum as shown in Figure 2. The
time Tpeak is determined as the time bin with minimum ADC count. In the re-
Tpeak)/tfall
gion [Tpeak +50; Tpeak +350] an exponential A(t) = Apeak ∗
is ﬁt to the ADC spectrum to determine the amplitude Apeak at Tpeak. The
time T 0 is determined via a linear ﬁt to 25 time bins at the rising edge as
ADC(T 0) = Apeak/2 and the signal amplitude is
A(T 0). The amplitudes are
corrected for the relative gain of each channel. The RMS of the correction
coeﬃcients is 5%. Only signals with an amplitude of more than 2 ADC counts
are recognized as pad hits and taken into account. Events are rejected if a veto
channel has an amplitude of more than 8.5 ADC counts. The T 0 of a row is
determined as the amplitude weighted mean of the times of the hits in this
row.

and 9,10) start points are determined from a centroid calculation of the largest
amplitude channel and its neighbor pads. These two points are connected by a
line to form the seed track. Because of the multiplexing several seed tracks are
found and the track with the most rows having a related hit with an amplitude
of more than 8.5 is chosen. In general this choice is unique. There must be at
least six rows with hits out of the eight outer and test rows. Other events are
rejected from the analysis.

The track projection in the x-y plane can be described with three parameters:
the x-position at y=0, x0, the track angle, φ, and the width of the charge
cloud, σtrack. The track parameters are determined from a maximum likeli-
hood ﬁt where a uniform line of charge with a Gaussian proﬁle is assumed.
This idealized distribution is integrated over the pad areas and normalized
across a row to obtain the expected charge probabilities. From these and the
observed signal amplitudes a likelihood function is determined, which includes
a uniform noise probability of 0.2%. The noise level is determined from the
data; a variation between 0.1 and 0.5% has only a small eﬀect on the ﬁtted
track parameters.

The drift distance at y=0, z0, and the angle θ are determined from a straight
line ﬁt to the T 0 of each row as a function of y. All eight rows are used
to determine global distributions of track angles φ and θ as well as x0 and
z0. The drift velocities as determined from the data are 55 µm/ns for P10
and 8.3 µm/ns for ArCO2. The result for P10 is in good agreement with the
prediction from MAGBOLTZ given in Table 1, while the measured velocity for
ArCO2 is smaller than expected. This might be due to a limited time window

electrons over the full drift distance of 15 cm due to attachment. This is an
indication of impurities in the gas which may aﬀect gas properties.

5 Analysis Results

The resolution for the drift distance z is shown in Figure 3 as a function of
drift distance. The intrinsic time resolution is about 13 ns for P10 and 9 ns
for ArCO2. It is worse for P10 since the average signal amplitude is smaller.
While the z resolution for P10 is completely dominated by the intrinsic time
resolution, the eﬀect of longitudinal diﬀusion is visible for ArCO2 because of
the much smaller drift velocity. The observed dependence is linear and not
quadratic as expected: sz/µm = 80 + 14
z/cm. It does not depend on the
readout pad size.

the concept of the point position in a row is not a priori given. The x-position
in a row, xrow is determined from a track ﬁt to the charge distribution in this
row only, keeping all track parameters ﬁxed apart from x. The x-resolution
sx is obtained from the width σ of a Gaussian ﬁt to the distribution of the
yrow. If these residuals are
residuals δ = xrow −
derived from a track ﬁt including the test row the obtained spread σin will be
systematically too small. On the other hand the spread σex obtained from a

geometric mean of these two results sx = √σin
σex gives the correct estimate
for the point resolution. For these studies the charge width σtrack is ﬁxed to
the mean observed track width as a function of the drift distance.

cloud, three regions of drift distance are considered as given in Table 2. For
short drift distances, hence small charge-cloud size, the resolution gets signif-
icantly worse in the centre of the pad. This is because an increased fraction

of signals is collected only on one pad and charge sharing is less eﬀective for
the determination of the position of the track in this row. This eﬀect leads
also to a non-uniform distribution of the measured xrow positions, where more
hits are reconstructed in the center of a pad if the pad is too wide. This study
is repeated for the 2 mm and 2.5 mm (row 4) wide pads, which shows that
the eﬀect sets in if the pad is wider than about three times the width of the
charge cloud and becomes prominent for a pad width larger than four times
the charge width. However, this eﬀect depends also on the amplitude; signals
with large amplitude tend to have more charge sharing. This study indicates
that 3 mm wide pads are too wide for a charge cloud with a width of less than
about 1 mm, which is the case for ArCO2 and P10 at small drift distances. To
avoid this eﬀect, the following analyses are restricted to the 2 mm wide pads.

5.2 X resolution depending on drift distance z

The resolution deteriorates with increasing drift distance because of transverse
< 5◦, to suppress
diﬀusion. This is studied using tracks with small angle,
the track angle eﬀect. As can be seen in Figure 6 the eﬀect is less pronounced
in ArCO2 because of the very small diﬀusion. The function

50% independent of the amplitude. This might be caused by transparency,

The track angle eﬀect on the resolution is expected to be
on the length of the pad as well as the eﬀective number of clusters N ǫ
cl. Figure 8

than 3 cm for three regions of amplitude. The following function is ﬁt to the
data:

where ϕ is an additional free parameter allowing for a bias in the track angle
and s includes contributions from diﬀusion sD. For the ﬁt the number of
clusters Ncl is taken to be independent of the amplitude, all variations being
assigned to the exponent ǫ. The ﬁt results for s, ϕ and ǫ are given in Table 4.

The oﬀset ϕ is consistent with 0 indicating that there is no systematic shift.
The number of primary clusters Ncl is reduced to the number of eﬀective
clusters by the exponent ǫ. We see no dependence of ǫ on the amplitude. As
expected the basic resolution s improves with amplitude. Due to the high gain
s is mainly determined by the diﬀusion sD and not so much by the internal
resolution s0.

6 Conclusion

We have investigated the dependence of the spatial resolution of cosmic-ray
tracks in a GEM TPC on various parameters. We found that the resolution
degrades if the pads are too wide with respect to the track-charge width ar-
riving at the readout plane due to insuﬃcient charge sharing between readout
pads. The observed charge width is larger than that expected from transverse
diﬀusion between the GEMs and the readout plane. Therefore 2 mm wide
pads are large enough to achieve a resolution of 100 µm for drift distances of
less than 3 cm in the absence of an axial magnetic ﬁeld. The dependence of
the spatial resolution as a function of drift distance allows the determination
of the underlying electron statistics. Our results show that with the present
technique eﬀectively only about half of the primary electron statistics is used
for the position determination. The track angle eﬀect is observed as expected.

A Corrections to the x resolution

When determining the point resolution the typical method involves ﬁtting
a straight line to all points and determining the standard deviation of the
residuals; this method gives a resolution that is too good, since the point for
which the resolution is to be determined was included in the line ﬁt. The
alternate method is to ﬁt a straight line without the point for which the
resolution is to be determined; this gives a resolution which is worse than
the actual resolution since the line is determined from the other points which
themselves have an uncertainty.

A detailed analysis reveals that a better estimate of the true resolution is given
by the geometric mean of the two methods, that is: σ2
i , where σi is
i = σδin
i ·
i and δex
the better estimate of the resolution si for point i, δin
i are the measured
residuals when the point is included and excluded respectively, and σδin
i and
σδex
i are the standard deviations of the residual distribution when the point is
included and excluded from the ﬁt.

Let us assume a track consisting of N measurements with known values yj,
N. The corresponding measured values xj are distributed around the
1
≤
= a + b yj with the standard deviations sj, where a and
expected mean
b are the track parameters. To determine the resolution of one measurement
i it is convenient to choose the coordinate system so that yi = 0. In this
xi, where a can be determined from
case, the residual is given by δi = a
a least square ﬁt to the track by either including (ain) or excluding (aex
i ) the
measurement i. The residual δi will be distributed with a standard deviation
σδi which is related to si, but depends on the coordinates (xj, yj) and weights

The quantities Din and Dex
i are ﬁxed for a given layout and can be calculated
to correct the resolution measured, however it is simpler to combine the last
two expressions:

s2
i = σδin

·

With this one can thus get a better estimate of the resolution by taking the
geometric mean of the resolution as determined with the point included in and
with the point excluded from the ﬁt without having to calculate a correction
factor. As expected, our tests show that for a large sample the results are
identical for the two methods.

The full exploitation of the physics potential of an International Linear Collider (ILC) requires the development
of a polarized positron beam. New concepts of polarized positron sources are based on the development of circularly
polarized photon sources. The polarized photons create electron-positron pairs in a thin target and transfer their
polarization state to the outgoing leptons. To achieve a high level of positron polarization the understanding of
the production mechanisms in the target is crucial. Therefore a general framework for the simulation of polarized
processes with Geant4 is under development.
In this contribution the current status of the project and its
application to a study of the positron production process for the ILC is presented.

1. Introduction

A future International Linear Collider (ILC)
provides an outstanding tool for the precise ex-
ploration of physics at TeV scale [1]. In contrast
to hadron colliders, the well deﬁned initial state
and the cleanliness of the ﬁnal states allow for
a precise measurement of Standard Model and
new physics processes. Having both, positron and
electron, beams polarized will be a decisive im-
provement for physics studies. A recent review of
the physics case of ILC using polarized positrons
can be found in [2].

One possible layout for the production of polar-
ized positrons is sketched in ﬁgure 1. Circularly
polarized photons are created by sending the elec-
tron beam through a helical undulator [3]. In a
thin target the photons are converted into polar-
ized positrons via pair creation. In comparison to
a conventional positron source this method sub-
stantially reduces the heat load in the positron
target.

A demonstration experiment to quantify the
yield of polarization of an undulator based
positron source, E166 [4], is currently performed
at SLAC. The experience gained with E166 is de-
cisive for designing and optimising the polarized
positron source of the ILC. The precise simula-

tion of the positron production as well as the po-
larimetry processes is essential for a complete un-
derstanding of the data obtained at E166. A sim-
ulation toolkit for the investigation of polarized
processes based on Geant4 is currently under
development. In this contribution a status report
of this project is given.

2. Implementing polarization into Geant4

Geant4 is a toolkit for the simulation of the
Individ-
passage of particles trough matter [5].

step can lead to creation of particles, destruction
of particles, or to a modiﬁcation of the particle
properties. The aspect of polarization has so far
been widely neglected 1. With our extension it
will be possible to track also polarized particles
(leptons and photons). Special emphasis will be
put in the proper treatment of polarized matter,
which is essential for the simulation of positron
polarimetry. It is planned to create a universal
framework for polarization and to implement it
in an oﬃcial Geant4 release.

To realise this project, the following polariza-

tion dependent processes have to be considered

• Compton scattering,
• Bhabha/Møller scattering,
• Pair creation,
• Bremsstrahlung.

In addition to these well localised interactions,
the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on the electron
(or positron) spin has to be treated properly.

In the following section, a brief review of ex-
isting simulation tools for polarization transfer is
given.
In the subsequent sections the proposed
framework for Geant4 is presented.

2.1. Existing codes for the simulation of

polarized processes

Several simulation packages for the realistic de-
scription of the development of electromagnetic
showers in matter have been developed. A promi-
nent example of such codes is EGS (Electron
Gamma Shower)[6]. For this simulation frame-
work extensions with the treatment of polarized
particles exist [7,8,9]; the most complete has been
developed by K. Fl¨ottmann [7].
It is based on
the matrix formalism [10], which enables a very
general treatment of polarization. However, the
Fl¨ottmann extension concentrates on evaluation
of polarization transfer, i.e. the eﬀects of polar-
ization induced asymmetries are neglected, and
interactions with polarized media are not consid-
ered.

Another important simulation tool for detector
studies is Geant3 [11]. Here also some eﬀort

lease of Geant4 is Compton scattering of linear polarized,

has been made to include polarization [4,12], but
these extensions are not publicly available.

2.2. Polarization framework for Geant4

The package Geant4 is the newest member

in C++.
It has a wide range of application,
and slowly replaces the Fortran based simulation
toolkits.

The proposed implementation of polarized pro-
cesses is based on Stokes vectors and allows a con-
venient description of the polarization transfer by
the matrix formalism [10]. In this formalism, a
three-component polarization vector ξ is assigned
to each particle and characterises completely the
polarization state of any lepton or photon2. For
the simulation of polarized media, a possibility
to assign Stokes vectors to physical volumes has
to be provided in Geant4. This is handled by
a new class, the so-called polarization manager.
It also allows the evaluation of Stokes vectors in
diﬀerent frames of reference.

The general procedure is very similar to the
polarization extension to EGS by Fl¨ottmann [7].
Any interaction is described by a transfer matrix
T , which characterises the process completely. It
usually depends on kinematic variables like en-
ergy and angle, but it can also depend on polar-
ization states (e.g. of the media). The ﬁnal state
polarization ξ is determined via matrix multipli-
cation with the incoming Stokes vector ξ0,

The components I0 and I refer to the incom-
ing and outgoing intensities, respectively. In this
framework the transfer matrix T is of the form

2This vector is already present in the current release of
Geant4, but it is only used in low-energy Compton scat-
tering of linear polarized photons. The interpretation as
Stokes vector allows for the usage in a more general frame-
work.

The matrix elements Tij can be identiﬁed as (un-
polarized) diﬀerential cross section (S), polar-
ized diﬀerential cross section (Aj), polarization
transfer (Mij ), and (de)polarization (Pi). In the
Fl¨ottmann extension the elements Aj and Pi have
been neglected, thus concentrating on polariza-
tion transfer only. Using the full matrix takes
now all polarization eﬀects into account. The
structure is illustrated with a few examples in the
following section.

graph shows the dependence of the scattering an-
gle on the polarization states of target (electron)

The ﬁrst process studied is Compton scatter-
ing. This process possesses all basic features: a
polarization dependent diﬀerential and total cross
section, polarization transfer and depolarization
eﬀects. Compton scattering is of great impor-
tance in polarimetry.

(dipole) radiation is at 9.62 MeV.

a 100% circularly polarized photon beam and
a 100% longitudinally polarized iron foil is as-
sumed3. When ﬂipping the electron spin from
an anti-parallel conﬁguration with respect to the
photon spin (blue) to a parallel orientation (red),
the distribution changes drastically, and the total
cross section decreases. For illustration, the case
where both, target and beam, are unpolarized is
also plotted (black). A comparison with an ana-
lytic formula (solid lines) shows perfect agreement
in all cases.

In a next step a more realistic simulation of
target properties will be performed to study the
eﬀects of diﬀerent polarized processes.

3.2. ILC positron source studies

The polarization transfer in a undulator based
positron source has been investigated. Since the
target is unpolarized, the total cross section, i.e.
the interaction length, does not depend on the
photon polarization. Consequently it is suﬃcient
to concentrate on the polarization transfer from
incoming photons to outgoing positrons.

The setup of the simulation consists of an in-
coming photon beam with the characteristic en-
ergy spectrum of a helical undulator, cf. ﬁg. 3.

3Note, that this is an academic case, since the maximal
degree of polarization in iron is 2/26 ≈ 7.69%.

Figure 4. Degree of polarization of created
positrons. The degree of polarization of the in-
coming photon beam is ﬁxed to 100%, the energy
spectrum of the photons is given in ﬁg. 3. Each
dot corresponds to a single answer of the trans-
fer matrix. The mean degree of polarization is
plotted as the (blue) proﬁle histogram.

As a ﬁrst approximation, the polarization of the
photon beam is assumed to be 100%. The degree
of polarization of the positrons created in pair
production depends also on the energies of the
incoming photon and the outgoing positron. In
general the degree of the positron polarization is
increasing with the energy fraction of the created
positron, see ﬁgure 4.

A simple ﬁrst check of the polarization routine
is provided by assuming an equal mixture of left
and right circularly polarized photons as incom-
ing beam. In this case one expects to obtain an
unpolarized positron beam.
Indeed, in ﬁgure 5
this behaviour can be observed.

Now the polarization spectrum of the helical
undulator as plotted in ﬁgure 6 will be included
in the study. The simulation shows the marginal
inﬂuence on the obtained degree of positron po-
larization.
In particular, high energy positrons
are nearly 100% polarized, see ﬁgure 7.

For a realistic simulation of a polarized positron
source based on a helical undulator the eﬀects
of bremsstrahlung, multiple scattering, Coulomb
and screening correction have to be taken into ac-
count. In ﬁgure 8 the inﬂuence of these processes

on the obtained positron energy spectrum is in-
vestigated. It is shown, that only a small fraction
(green) of all produced positrons (blue histogram)
will escape from the target. The energy spec-
trum of positrons that leave the target is shifted
to lower values in comparison to their spectrum at
the creation point (red). Consequently, the tar-
get acts as a ﬁlter for high energy positrons and
the created positrons have suﬀered a substantial
loss of energy. The eﬀect of bremsstrahlung and
multiple scattering on the degree of polarization
of the produced positrons will be the subject of
further investigations.

4. Conclusion

In this report the current status of a project
to implement polarization into the framework of
Geant4 has been presented. For this task the
Stokes formalism is employed, providing a sys-
tematic approach for a consistent treatment of
polarized leptons and photons. Some prelimi-
nary results demonstrate the applicability of this
new extension to polarimetry (Compton scatter-
ing) and polarization transfer studies (positron
source). These analyses represent the ﬁrst steps
toward a realistic target simulation of an undula-
tor based positron source for the ILC.

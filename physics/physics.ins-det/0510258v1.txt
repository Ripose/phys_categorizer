A low background Micromegas detector has been operating on the CAST exper-
iment at CERN for the search of solar axions during the ﬁrst phase of the ex-
periment (2002-2004). The detector operated eﬃciently and achieved a very low
level of background rejection (5 × 10−5 counts keV−1cm−2s−1) thanks to its good
spatial and energy resolution as well as the low radioactivity materials used in the
construction of the detector. For the second phase of the experiment (2005-2007),
the detector will be upgraded by adding a shielding and including focusing op-
tics. These improvements should allow for a background rejection better than two
orders of magnitude.

1. Introduction

The CAST (Cern Axion Solar Telescope) collaboration is using a decom-
missioned LHC dipole magnet to convert solar axions into detectable x-ray
photons. Axions are light pseudoscalar particles that arise in the context
of the Peccei-Quinn1 solution to the strong CP problem and can be Dark
Matter candidates2. Stars could produce axions via the Primakoﬀ conver-
sion of the plasma photons. The CAST experiment aims to track the Sun
in order to detect solar axions. The detection principle is based on the cou-
pling of an incoming axion to a virtual photon provided by the transverse
ﬁeld of an intense dipole magnet, being transformed into a real, detectable
photon that carries the energy and the momentum of the original axion.
The axion to photon conversion probability is proportional to the square of
the transverse ﬁeld of the magnet and to the active length of the magnet.
Using an LHC magnet (9 T and 9.26 m long) improves the sensitivity by a
factor 100 compared to previous experiments. A more detailed description
of the principle of the experiment can be found in Zioutas et al.3.

For the ﬁrst phase of the experiment, 2002-2004, three diﬀerent types
of detectors have been developed to detect the x-rays originated by the
conversion of the axions inside the vacuum of the magnet: a time projection
chamber (TPC), a CCD and a Micromegas detector. The CCD detector has
been working in conjunction with a mirror system to focus x-rays coming
out of the magnet bores improving its signal to background ratio. The
analysis of the data collected during 2003 shows no excess of signal over
background and has resulted in the most restrictive experimental limit on
the coupling constant of axions to photons4. The CAST second phase,
2005-2007, will allow us to scan axion masses greater than 0.02 eV/c2.
This is made possible by ﬁlling the magnet bore with a buﬀer gas (4He or
3He) allowing the photon to acquire an eﬀective mass. During 2005 a He
gas system has been designed and constructed, allowing systematic changes
of the He pressure. Cold polypropylene windows have been installed in the
magnet bore to minimize the thermal coupling between the cold bore and
the outside of the magnet.

2. Performance of the Micromegas detector during phase I

2.1. Description

The Micromegas detector is a double gap chamber. It consists of a conver-
sion gap separated from an ampliﬁcation gap by a gauze-light electroformed
conducting micromesh. A full description of the detection principle can be

found in Giomataris et al.5. For CAST, the conversion gap is 20 (30) mm
thick and the ampliﬁcation gap used was of 50 (100) µm in the 2003 (2004)
data taking. The gas mixture is 95 % Argon and 5 % Isobutane. The ﬁeld
applied to the ampliﬁcation gap is about 40 times higher than the conver-
sion ﬁeld. The charge is collected on a two dimensional readout by means
of X and Y strips of 350 µm pitch.The mechanical pieces of the detector are
of Plexiglas because of its low natural radioactivity to limit as much as pos-
sible the inherent background of the detector. The Micromegas detector,
which operates at atmospheric pressure, is interfaced with the LHC magnet
by two thin vacuum windows. These two windows, made of polypropylene,
act as a buﬀer for the pressure gradient and at the same time they need
to maximize the x-ray transmission in the energy range of interest for the
axion search. The integrated x-ray eﬃciency of the detector in the solar
axion energy spectrum (1-8 keV) is of 73 % taking into account the loss in
transmission due to the thin windows as well as the conversion eﬃciency of
the gas.

2.2. Results

The detector has run successfully during the ﬁrst phase of the experiment.
The Micromegas detector records tracking data at sunrise, and during the
rest of the day background data is taken. The detector is calibrated daily
using a 55Fe source. The energy resolution at 6 keV is 20 % (FWHM).
Tracking and background data have been analysed. Signal events (photons
with a mean energy of 2-8 keV) have a well deﬁned signature giving a
typical cluster in the read out strips and a typical pulse in the micromesh.
Background events, coming from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity, give
out a bigger cluster in the strips, and the pulse shape in the micromesh is
very diﬀerent favouring an eﬃcient rejection based on the micromesh pulse
shape and on the cluster topology.

Figure 1 shows the energy spectra for background events for 2003 and
2004 data. In these plots, a ﬂat background is observed with a superimposed
peak at 8 keV. This peak has been identiﬁed as the copper ﬂuorescence
peak coming from the detector materials (micromesh and readout strips).
Thanks to the upgrading of the detector in 2004 and the elimination of
residual cross-talk between strips, the background rejection was improved
of a factor 3 with respect to 2003, achieving a level of 5 × 10−5 counts
keV−1cm−2s−1. The combined analysis of the three CAST detectors for
the 2003 data has resulted in a limit on the coupling constant of photon

to axions4. This limit, 1.16 × 10−10 GeV−1 for ma < 0.02 eV, improves
the existing experimental limit by a factor 6. The 2004 combined analysis
should allow us to extract a limit close to the theoretical bound coming
from astrophysical considerations.

3. The new Micromegas line for phase II

During the transformation of the magnet for phase II, the Micromegas
group has been designing an upgraded Micromegas detector surrounded
by a shielding and coupled to an x-ray optic, as shown in Figure 2. This
new line should be installed at the CAST experiment during spring 2006.
These upgrades will improve signiﬁcantly the performance of the detector.
First, the x-ray optic, a concentrator with a 1.3 m focal length and 47 mm
diameter, will allow us to increase the signal to noise ratio by a factor
∼ 100 by focusing the photon ﬂux in a 2 mm spot. This concentrator will
consist of 14 nested polycarbonate shells, each 125 mm long and coated with
iridium. The optic will transmit ∼ 36% of the 0.5-10 keV ﬂux emerging
from the magnet bore. Second, the shielding, composed of copper, lead,
cadmium, nitrogen and polyethylene, is expected to reduce the background
by a factor of 4. Third, by changing the gas of the chamber from Argon
to Xenon, the photon conversion probability can be improved by at least
∼ 10%. The new detector will be running with the same electronics and
acquisition developed for phase I. First tests of a prototype of the detector
have started. The complete line, with the integrated optics, is expected to
be operational for characterisation tests and calibration at the PANTER
x-ray test facility in Munich beginning of 2006. Recent developments on

the integration of Micromegas with pixel CMOS readout6, may lead to an
ultimate upgrade of the detector for the 2007 data taking to proﬁt of the
spatial and energy resolution of pixel sensors.

4. Conclusions

A low background Micromegas detector has been operating at the CAST
experiment achieving a remarkable background rejection (5 × 10−5 counts
keV−1cm−2s−1). For the CAST second phase, an upgraded Micromegas
detector with integrated x-ray optics and shielding will be installed at the
experiment during spring 2006. These improvements should lead to a re-
duction of the background level by at least two orders of magnitude.

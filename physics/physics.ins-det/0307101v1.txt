A Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) is proposed as upgrade of the PHENIX detector at RHIC, BNL. The HBD
will allow the measurement of low-mass e+e− pairs from the decay of the light vector mesons ρ, ω, φ and the
low-mass continuum in Au-Au collisions at energies up to √sNN = 200 GeV . From MC simulations and general
considerations, the HBD has to identify electrons with very high eﬃciency (> 90%), double hit recognition better
than 90%, moderate pion rejection factor of
200 and radiation budget of the order of 1% of a radiation length.
The ﬁrst choice under study is a windowless Cherenkov detector, operated with pure CF4, in a special proximity
focus conﬁguration with a CsI photocathode and a multistage GEM ampliﬁcation element.

1. Introduction

The PHENIX experiment at RHIC, the Rel-
ativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven
National Laboratory,
is specially designed to
measure electrons, muons, photons, neutral
mesons and identiﬁed charged hadrons in ultra-
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. With this broad
spectrum of observables PHENIX is able to study
in detail the collision dynamics and in particular
the earliest stages where the new state of mat-
ter, known as the Quark-Gluon plasma (QGP) is
expected to be formed.

The layout of the PHENIX detector [1]
is
shown in Fig. 1. It consists of two central spec-
trometer arms, each one covering 90◦ in azimuth
and
< 0.35 and two forward muons spectrom-
eters with full azimuthal coverage in the pseudo-
< 2.2. The central arm
rapidity range 1.2 <
|
detectors are located outside an axially symmet-
ric magnetic ﬁeld provided by a central magnet.
The detectors include a high resolution tracking
system consisting of drift chambers, pad cham-
bers, and time-expansion chambers. Together
with a high resolution time-of-ﬂight hodoscope,
electromagnetic calorimeters, and a gas-ﬁlled ring
imaging Cherenkov counter, the central arms pro-
vide excellent hadron, electron, and photon iden-

For global event characterization, the setup in-
cludes a silicon vertex detector, two zero-degree
calorimeters sensitive to neutrons emitted along
the beam axis, and a set of beam-beam counters
to determine the reference for time-of-ﬂight mea-

surement and vertex determination. The data ac-
quisition system is capable of archiving 60 MB/s
which corresponds to about 400 minimum bias
Au-Au events per second.

The present set-up of the PHENIX detector
does not allow a good measurement of low-mass
1GeV /c2. Tracks
electron pairs with me+e−
with momentum p
200M eV cannot leave
the magnetic ﬁeld region. Thus, very often for
the pairs originating from γ conversions and π0
Dalitz decays only one of the partners is detected.
This leads to a huge combinatorial background
that increases quadratically with the number of
charged tracks Nch. At the high multiplicities of
RHIC, this makes signal detection extremely dif-
ﬁcult. For example, ﬁrst PHENIX results show,
in agreement with Monte Carlo studies, that
even with a large single electron pt cut of 300
M eV /c, the φ meson measurement has a signal
to background ratio, S/B, of about 1/20 [2] and
400M eV /c2,
at lower invariant masses me+e−
S/B

1/100.

A proposal for an upgrade of the PHENIX de-
tector to dramatically improve the performance
in the measurement of low-mass e+e− pairs is
presently under study. The upgrade has two main
elements: the installation of a second coil, fore-
seen in the original PHENIX design, to generate
an almost ﬁeld-free region extending up to
60
cm in the radial direction and an additional de-
tector in that region to recognize, and provide
the necessary rejection of, Dalitz and conversion
tracks.

∼

∼

In this paper, we limit the discussion to a pos-
sible realization of this additional detector. We
ﬁrst present the detector concept, expected per-
formance and beneﬁts. We then describe the cur-
rent R&D program to address a number of issues
and questions raised.

2. General Concept of the Upgrade

The basic idea of the proposed upgrade exploits
the fact that the opening angle of electron pairs
from γ conversions and π0 Dalitz decays is small
compared to the pairs from light vector mesons.
In a ﬁeld-free region this angle is preserved and
by applying an opening angle cut one can reject

more than 90% of the conversions and π0 Dalitz
decays, while coserving most of the signal.

Monte Carlo studies at the principle level [3],
with an additional detector in the zero ﬁeld re-
gion, assuming perfect spatial resolution and per-
fect electron identiﬁcation give a S/B ratio of
10 at the φ meson mass region with an open-
∼
ing angle cut of
180 mrad. The simulations
show that the background tracks remaining after
such cut are close to the boundaries of the ﬁdu-
cial acceptance. Therefore adding a veto area to
the inner detector further improves the S/B ratio.
For example, increasing the acceptance in the az-
imuthal direction from 90◦ to 120◦ and from
0.35 to
reach a S/B ratio of about 25 [3].

At this level of rejection, the quality of the low-
mass e+e− pair measurement will not any longer
be limited by the combinatorial background of
conversions and π0 Dalitz decays but rather by
the background originating from semi-leptonic
decays of charmed mesons. Reducing this lat-
ter source is beyond the scope of the proposed
upgrade. Current crude estimates of the S/B in-
cluding the charm background give a S/B

3. Hadron Blind Detector

The results of the simulations and general con-
siderations allow us to determine the inner de-
tector speciﬁcations: electron identiﬁcation with
an eﬃciency > 90% including double hit recog-
nition; a moderate π rejection factor as low as
100-200; the detector must ﬁt within the radial
distance 20
70 cm; the detector should cover
a slightly larger acceptance (veto area) than the
central arms; a radiation budget of the order of
1% of a radiation length.

≤

≤

r

The requirements on electron identiﬁcation
limit the choice to a Cherenkov type detector.
After careful consideration of relevant options
(conﬁguration, radiator gas, window, detector
gas, photocathode, amplifying element, readout
scheme) our ﬁrst choice is an HBD (Hadron Blind
Detector) [4,5] in the following conﬁguration: a
Cherenkov detector operated with pure CF4 (or
a CF4 based mixture) both as radiator and detec-
tor gas, in a special windowless proximity focus

geometry, with a CsI photocathode, multistage
GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) [6,7] as detector
element and pad readout.

In this conﬁguration, Cherenkov photons from
an electron passing through the radiator are di-
rectly collected on the CsI photocathode, evapo-
rated onto the ﬁrst GEM, forming a circular blob,
not a ring as in a RICH detector.

The location of the HBD in the PHENIX de-
tector is shown in Fig. 2 and a possible layout of
the readout element is shown in Fig. 3.

Figure 2. The HBD location in the PHENIX de-
tector.

Figure 3. Layout of the readout element of the
HBD.

This scheme exhibits a number of very attrac-
tive features. The use of a windowless detector
with CF4 results in a very broad bandwidth be-
6eV up to the CF4
tween the CsI threshold of
11.5eV and a large ﬁgure of merit
cut-oﬀ of

∼

∼

940cm−1 (N0 = R Q.E. dE). After includ-
N0
ing losses incurred by the optical transparency of
the entrance mesh (10%) and the photocathode
(25%) a very large number of detected photoelec-
trons, Npe = 40, is expected in a 50 cm long ra-
diator. This large number of photoelectrons en-
sures a very high electron eﬃciency. The ”reﬂec-
tive” photocathode scheme makes the CsI totally
screened from photons produced in the avalanche.
The mesh before the ﬁrst GEM is needed to en-
sure a zero ﬁeld above the photocathode, which
is best for electron extraction in the ”reﬂective”
mode [7]. Since the pattern produced by the de-
tector is a circular blob (maximum radius of 1.8
cm in a 50 cm long radiator) there is no a pri-
ori need to detect single photo-electrons as in a
RICH detector. This has the double beneﬁt of
low-granularity (the pad size can be comparable
to the blob size) and a relatively low gain oper-
ation (since a pad will collect a relatively large
primary charge).

4. Expected Performance of the HBD

4.1. Occupancy and event rate

The occupancy and interaction rate expected
at the HBD are very modest. With a charged
particle density dNch/dη = 650 in central Au-Au
collisions at √sN N = 200GeV the largest detec-
tor occupancy is calculated to be 0.02 charged
particles/cm2. For minimum bias events the oc-
cupancy drops by approximately a factor of
3
The expected interaction rate is 1400 Hz at the
design RHIC luminosity.

∼

4.2. Scintillation of CF4

CF4 is known to scintillate and its scintillation
properties were studied by several groups [8,9].
The main feature of the scintillation spectrum is
a line at 163 nm where the CsI is sensitive.

Since scintillation occurs uniformly in 4π
whereas the Cherenkov light is emitted in a very
narrow cone a considerable reduction of the scin-
tillation background can be achieved by installing
shades. With a simple simulation, the scintilla-
tion background over the size of a blob is found
to be 4 photo-electrons. Adding radial shades
close to the photocathode, 5 cm high and with 5
cm spacing in both directions, reduces the back-

4

ground by a factor of three while reducing the
Cherenkov photons by less than 10%.

4.3. Detector response to electrons and

hadrons

The detector performance for a few options
with CF4-based gases is shown in Table 1. (More
options are considered in [3]).

The table shows the estimated response to elec-
trons and hadrons. The response to electrons is
characterized by the number of detected photo-
electrons Npe, the maximum radius of the blob
Rblob and the double hit recognition DHR. DHR
is the probability to resolve two electrons with
zero opening angle using amplitude analysis, and
accepting 5% misidentiﬁcation of single electrons
as double hits.

The response to hadrons is characterized by the
number of electrons Ne produced by a hadron
within the size of a blob.
It may be uniformly
spread over the whole detector area as in the case
of scintillation (G) or localized (L) in one pad
when it results from ionization. For the latter we
have assumed that the relevant ionization path-
length for a particle traversing the ﬁrst GEM is
only the distance above its surface corresponding
to a half of the hole pitch (
100µm) where the
electric ﬁeld collects the primary ionization inside
the holes.

∼

The last column of Table 1 shows an estimate
of the π rejection factor that can be achieved. It
is deﬁned as the number of incident pions divided
by the number of π producing a signal above the
lowest 5% of a single electron signal.

5. R&D Program and plans

Among the options listed in Table 1, the sim-
plest and most attractive is the ﬁrst one. It gives
around 40 photoelectrons per electron.
It has
excellent DHR and very high π rejection. Re-
cently the operation of a detector consisting of
CsI photocathode, three stages of GEM in pure
CF4 has been demonstrated [10]. It gives some
support that the proposed conﬁguration of the
HBD can be realized. We consider this as our
prime choice and the other options in the table
and others listed in [3] are alternatives to cure

possible problems which may arise. Indeed there
are a number of issues and questions which need
to be investigated in a comprehensive R&D pro-
gram which has recently started.

The main goal of

the R&D program is
to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
Hadron Blind Detector conﬁguration. The spe-
ciﬁc issues to be investigated are:

♦ Further studies of the CF4 scintillation. We
plan to measure the scintillation signal produced
by a MIP in the laboratory using cosmic muons.
From our current estimates the scintillation back-
ground is negligible. However, if needed it could
be substantially reduced by installing shades. De-
tailed simulations will be needed to optimize the
shade conﬁguration.

♦ Study of aging eﬀects on the GEMs elements
and the CsI photocathode in pure CF4 atmo-
sphere. This is one of the most critical issues. The
CsI QE degrades with a high dose of accumulated
charge [11]. From published numbers [11], this
does not seem to represent a problem. The total
charge expected to be accumulated on the CsI
over 10 years of continuous operation of the detec-
tor at design luminosity is well below 1mC/cm2
(even assuming 100% ion feedback). However, ag-
ing in the presence of CF4 might be more severe
and needs to be studied. The biggest concern is
the aggressivity of CF4 with some materials and
HF which can be formed by chemical reactions
of CF4 with water.

♦ Optimize the detector conﬁguration: 2-3
GEMs or 2 GEMs + MWPC. One of the most
important requirements is a stable operation of
the detector without sparking at a high enough
gain to ensure the required electron identiﬁcation.
♦ Detector granularity needs to be studied and
optimized. This is an important design param-
eter aﬀecting occupancy, hit pile-up, DHR and
last but not least cost. Our ﬁrst option here is
to detect the blob in hexagonal pads of size com-
parable to the blob size. This ensures as much
charge as possible in one pad, a low gas gain fac-
tor in the detector and low granularity.

♦ Study and optimize the HBD response to
electrons versus hadrons. This is one of the most
important features of the proposed detector. The
electric ﬁeld above the ﬁrst GEM plays a crucial

role here [7]. It aﬀects the collection of photoelec-
trons released from the CsI and also the collected
primary charge from the passage of a hadron.

♦ Deﬁne the speciﬁcations and develop the
front-end electronics. Analog information will be
needed to recognize single and double hits. The
speciﬁcations are closely linked to other parame-
ters of the system, like the pad size, the expected
signal amplitude and shape.

♦ Study the inﬂuence of residual magnetic
ﬁeld on the pattern recognition. The second coil
largely compensates the magnetic ﬁeld created by
the main coil. However this does not result in a
fully ﬁeld-free region. Some residual ﬁeld will be
present and its inﬂuence on the pattern recogni-
tion has to be studied.

♦ Monte Carlo simulations. There is a broad
program of simulations that have to be per-
formed: (i) include the HBD in a full Monte Carlo
simulation to study and optimize its response.
(ii) How much material can be tolerated before
the HBD? (iii) More realistic simulations of the
HBD and its impact in rejecting the combinato-
rial background, including all sources of electrons
(γ conversions, Dalitz decays, resonance decays
and semi-leptonic decays of open charm).

Abstract

A new type of ﬁeld emission display (FED) based on an edge-enhance electron emis-

sion from metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) thin ﬁlm structure is proposed. The

electrons produced by an avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor near the edge of a

top metal electrode are initially injected to the thin ﬁlm of an insulator with a negative

electron aﬃnity (NEA), and then are injected into vacuum in proximity to the top elec-

trode edge. The condition for the deep-depletition breakdown near the edge of the top

metal electrode is analytically found in terms of ratio of the insulator thickness to the

maximum (breakdown) width of the semiconductor depletition region: this ratio should

be less than 2/(3π

2)

0.27. The inﬂuence of a neighboring metal electrode and an

electrode thickness on this condition are analyzed. Diﬀerent practical schemes of the

−

≃

proposed display with a special reference to M/CaF2/Si structure are considered.

1 Introduction

Flat panel ﬁeld emission displays have the potential to be a low cost, high performance

alternative to the currently dominant cathode ray tube and liquid crystal displays. The ﬁrst

major problem in FEDs is the development of a reliable and eﬃcient cold cathode electron

emitter. Current FED prototypes use sharp metal or semiconductor tips as ﬁeld emitters [1],

that requires expensive lithography and other diﬃcult fabrication processes. Besides, the

1

control voltage for such tip emitters is rather high (about 100 V). Some researchers use

diamond-like ﬁlms that contain nanoscale crystalline structure as the electron source [2], or

use diamond and other coatings of the sharp tips to improve the emission properties of the

tips [3, 4].

the MIS structure.

In the present paper we propose another type of ﬁeld emitter, where electrons are produced

by an avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor near the edge of the top metal electrode in

The plan of this paper is as follows: in Section 2 we describe the proposed display, based

on the edge breakdown of the MIS structure. In Section 3 we discuss the condition under

which edge breakdown in the MIS structure takes place. In Section 4 we estimate the inﬂuence

of a neighboring electrode on the edge breakdown condition and in Section 5 we discuss and

summarize our results. In Appendix we brieﬂy estimate the inﬂuence of an electrode thickness

on the edge breakdown condition.

2 Field emission display based on edge breakdown of

MIS structure

The display proposed is schematically shown in Figure 1(a). Glass substrate 1 with conductive

metal column lines 2 is coated with a thin semiconductor layer 3, which contains low p-doped

column lines 4 that coincide with the metal ones. The ﬁlm of the insulator with NEA 5 is

grown on semiconductor, and conductive metal row lines 6 are deposited on the insulator ﬁlm.

Above the MIS structure the ﬂuorescent screen 7 is located. The anode (ﬂuorescent screen)

and cathode (MIS structure) regions are separated by a vacuum space 8.

When a positive voltage pulse of duration which is short compared to the time constant of

thermal generation of minority carriers (electrons in our case) is applied to the top electrode

of the MIS structure, no inversion layer can form. Thus, a large potential drop across the

semiconductor will take place. If the amplitude of the pulse voltage is increased, band bending

reaches large values where minority carriers are generated by nonthermal eﬀects (by avalanche

in our case). The amplitude of the pulse voltage, at which avalanche occurs we designate by

Vbreak.

When we apply a pulse voltage Vcontrol, which amplitude is less then Vbreak, but more than

Vbreak/2 to one row line, and simultaneously apply such a pulse voltage with another polarity

2

to one column line, the avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor will take place at the

intersection of these lines. Under condition, which will be pointed out below, the breakdown

will take place near the edges of metal lines. Inasmuch as velocities of the avalanche electrons

at the semiconductor-insulator interface are directed in an arbitrary way, it is clear that at

least a portion of the avalanche electrons, ballistically passing through the thin ﬁlm of the

insulator, will be extracted with a good eﬃciency (due to NEA of the insulator) into vacuum

and will not impinge on the top metal layer. Then this portion of electrons will be accelerated

by screen voltage Vscreen (

+100

+1000 V) and will be hit to the ﬂuorescent screen as it is

shown in Figure 1(b).

3 Edge breakdown condition

The deep-depletition breakdown of MOS capacitors was ﬁrst reported by Goetsberger and

Nicollian [5, 6], who experimentally investigated doping conditions under which uniform

avalanche takes place. Later a “universal and normalized” criterion for “ﬁeld uniformity”

in MOS capacitors was oﬀered in the form d/Wmax > 0.3 (where d is the insulator thickness

and Wmax is the maximum (breakdown) width of the semiconductor depletition region) [7, 8].

This criterion was suggested in [7] based on computer-calculated values of the ﬁeld distribution

in MOS capacitors.

In this section we obtain this criterion in an analytical form, with an emphasis on physical

explanation of the result, that helps us to analyze operating conditions and an ultimate

resolution of the display proposed.

For this purpose let us at ﬁrst consider a simple two-dimensional model of the electric

ﬁeld near the edge of the metal plate (see Figure 2(a)). Here A1

are conductive plates. Let one plate have the potential V , and the other plate have the zero

potential.

We will use a method of conformal transformations (see [9] or any textbook in this ﬁeld)

to ﬁnd an electrical ﬁeld distribution in such a system. The Schwarz-Chrisoﬀel transform

Now the condition for edge breakdown is rather obvious: if insulator thickness is less than

zcr (as is shown in Figure 3) the breakdown takes place near the edge. But if d > zcr the

uniform breakdown occurs. The value d + Wmax in the real MIS structure plays the role of the

distance h between the conductive plates in our model consideration. (The exception is the

In this case h = L.) From the equations

h = d + Wmax

d < zcr =

we may obtain the criteria for the deep-depletition edge breakdown in terms of ratio of the

insulator thickness to the maximum (breakdown) width of the semiconductor depletition re-

One can see that the value obtained (0.27) is consistent with the value 0.3 obtained in the

work [7] by numerical computer-aided calculations for particular system M/SiO2/Si.

The model considered is applicable to real systems subject to the condition that the radius

of the edge curvature of the top electrode is less than insulator thickness.

4 Breakdown condition for double-edge structure

In this Section we apply analogous approach to ﬁnd breakdown condition for the system

illustrated in Figure 4(a). It is necessary for several reasons: ﬁrst, one may like to initiate

electron emission into a slit in the top electrode. Second, it may be convenient to apply a

voltage simultaneously to a set of neighboring row and column lines for more stable emission.

And third, minimal distance between top electrodes deﬁnes the ultimate resolution of the

proposed display.

5 Discussion and summary

Firstly, let us mention the kind of insulator that may be used in this display. At least three

kinds of insulators are appropriate for our purpose: hydrogen-terminated diamond (111), LiF

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

and CaF2. Diamond has long attracted considerable attention as a cold cathode for FED due

to its NEA and robust mechanical and chemical properties.

LiF has the largest NEA of any solid. The NEA of LiF crystal is

2.7 eV [12]. The

−

possibility of epitaxial grown of LiF ﬁlms on the Ge was also reported in [12].

But we assume that the CaF2/Si system is the best choice. The reasons for this are as

follows:

1. CaF2 has a small but negative electron aﬃnity [13].

2. A very attractive property of CaF2 is similarity of its crystal structure to Si: CaF2

has cubic m3m structure with only 0.6 % of lattice mismatch with Si(111) at room

temperature. This fact makes it possible to grow perfect single crystal ﬁlms of CaF2 on

silicon by molecular beam epitaxy technique [14, 15]. The crystalline quality, chemical

stability and electrical characteristics of CaF2 ﬁlms grown on Si(111) may be further

improved by rapid thermal annealing [16].

3. Barrier height between the conductive band minimum of Si and the conductive band

minimum of CaF2 is only

2.2 eV [15].

∼

escape depth of the order of 260 nm [17].

4. An additional attractive property of CaF2 is anomalously large low-energy electron

5. And lastly, the good emission properties of the CaF2/Si structure has recently been

demonstrated in the experiment [4].

The thickness of the insulator ﬁlm about d

10 nm seems to be nearly optimum because it

is large enough to avoid direct tunneling of electrons from semiconductor to metal, but it is

small enough for ballistic passing of electrons through insulator ﬁlm.

So, if one has 10 nm thick CaF2 ﬁlm on the 1 µm thick Si layer with p-dopant concentration
1016cm−3 (Wmax

1 µm [8]), one may be sure that when pulse voltages with the amplitude

10 V are applied to one row and one column lines an avalanche breakdown will

n

∼

occur at the edges of metal lines (d/Wmax

0.01). The control voltage may be still decreased

if the distance between metal electrodes L will be less than d + Wmax (but L must always

be more than 3πd/2). The avalanche electrons will be injected into insulator at the α

β

line, which shown in Figure 3. From geometrical considerations, up to several tens percent of

−

electrons may be injected into vacuum.

∼

To summarize, we have proposed a simple design of the ﬁeld-emission display based on the

deep-depletition edge avalanche breakdown of the MIS structure. The control voltage of this

display may be as small as tens volts and its ultimate resolution may reach several microns.

Appendix

Here we mention the inﬂuence of the top electrode thickness on the edge breakdown condition.

To avoid complicated expressions, we give only a simple estimation of the eﬀect by solving

the problem presented in Figure 5(a), where top electrode has zero thickness. The equation

relates the upper half ω plane (Figure 5(b)) to the interior of the region A1

less than thickness of the insulator ﬁlm.

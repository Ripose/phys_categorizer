Eﬀect of Optical Coating and Surface
Treatments on Mechanical Loss in Fused
Silica

Andri M. Gretarsson, Gregory M. Harry, Steven D. Penn, Peter R.
Saulson, John J. Schiller, and William J. Startin

Abstract. We report on the mechanical loss in fused silica samples with various
surface treatments and compare them with samples having an optical coating. Mild
surface treatments such as washing in detergent or acetone were not found to aﬀect the
mechanical loss of ﬂame-drawn fused silica ﬁbers stored in air. However, mechanical
contact (with steel calipers) signiﬁcantly increased the loss. The application of a high-
reﬂective optical coating of the type used for the LIGO test masses was found to greatly
increase the mechanical loss of commercially polished fused silica microscope slides. We
discuss the implications for the noise budget of interferometers.

I

INTRODUCTION

In samples made of high Q materials, such as fused silica or sapphire, a damaged
or optically coated surface can be the dominant source of mechanical loss and
could limit our ability to reduce thermal noise in interferometers. We apply a
general method for quantifying surface loss to measurements of samples with optical
coatings and diﬀering surface treatments. This enables us to estimate the eﬀect of
coatings on the internal mode thermal noise of interferometer test masses as well
as the eﬀect of suspension ﬁlament surface damage on the pendulum mode thermal
noise.

II QUANTIFYING SURFACE LOSS

Surface loss may be quantiﬁed by the dissipation depth ds, deﬁned by1

φ = φbulk(1 + µ

ds
V /S

),

(1)

where φ = 1/Q is the measured loss angle of the sample when all sources of extrinsic
loss (such as recoil damping or clamping friction) have been eliminated, φbulk is the
loss angle of the bulk material, V is the volume of the sample, and S is the surface
area. The unitless µ is a geometrical factor that takes into account the relative
amount of elastic deformation occurring at the surface and hence the emphasis
placed on the condition of the surface due to the sample geometry and mode of
oscillation. The geometrical factor µ is of order unity for simple geometries so

that, as a rule of thumb, surface loss tends to dominate when ds is greater than
the volume to surface area ratio. For ﬁbers in transverse oscillation µ = 2, while
for ribbon or microscope slide geometries in transverse oscillation µ = 3. Although
φbulk and ds may in general be functions of frequency, no frequency dependence was
seen in our measurements. For uncoated samples the dissipation depth provides a
quantitative measure of the physical condition of the surface.

III SURFACE TREATMENT OF UNCOATED

SAMPLES

By measuring the quality factor Q of samples before and after diﬀerent types
of surface treatment, we calculated the dissipation depth associated with each
treatment. We measured the quality factors of untreated and treated fused sil-
ica (Suprasil 2) ﬁbers drawn in a natural gas and oxygen ﬂame. We also measured
the quality factor of a fused silica (Suprasil 2) microscope slide, both as supplied
(mechanically polished) and as subsequently etched. Using an apparatus speciﬁ-
cally designed for the purpose of reducing extrinsic sources of loss (Fig. 1a) we were
generally able to reduce extrinsic losses suﬃciently so that the dominant sources of
loss remaining were thermoelastic loss, bulk loss, and surface loss.1 In each case we
measured the quality factors at frequencies where thermoelastic loss was negligible.
In this regime the quality factors were frequency independent, although in a minor-
ity of cases random mode-to-mode diﬀerences in Q were apparent. This was most
likely due to residual sources of excess loss. To reduce the systematic error due to
such residual sources of excess loss we took the highest Q mode to be indicative of
the quality factor resulting from bulk loss and surface loss alone.

To investigate the eﬀects of washing surfaces in solvents we wiped a ﬁber with
paper wipes (KimwipesTm) saturated with acetone. We also agitated a ﬁber in an
ultrasonic bath of detergent and warm tap-water for a half hour, followed by a half
hour ultrasonic bath of warm tap-water, followed by a second rinse with a stream
of distilled water. After measuring the Q we then waited 14 days with the ﬁber
10−6 Torr) and re-measured the Q. In an attempt to simulate the
under vacuum (
eﬀects of hydroxy catalysis bonding2 (silicate bonding) of fused silica surfaces we
washed a ﬁber with ethyl alcohol and then submerged it in a 0.5 Molar solution of
KOH and distilled water for 24.6 hrs, then rinsed in distilled water. To investigate
the eﬀect of mechanical damage we lightly pinched two ﬁbers at 1 cm intervals with
stainless steel measurement calipers.

≈

To remove the outer surface entirely (and with it any mechanical surface damage)
we etched three fused silica ﬁbers in solutions of hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) and distilled
water. After etching, the ﬁbers were rinsed with distilled water. The ﬁrst etch was
0.5 µm
performed on a ﬁber of diameter 120
from the surface. The second etch was performed on one of the ﬁbers previously
50 µm and the etch
pinched with calipers.
It had a pre-etch diameter of 840
3 µm. The third etch was performed on a ﬁber of pre-etch diameter
depth was 45

20 µm and the etch removed 1.5

(scratch-dig) polish. The etch removed 100 µm from this surface.

Table 1 summarizes our results. For three of the ﬁbers, with surfaces as drawn,
the dissipation depth is around 200 µm. Fiber I has a surface that is initially worse
(higher ds) while Fiber M has a surface that is initially better. Although an eﬀort
was made not to touch the surfaces of the ﬁbers with ﬁngers or other objects during
handling, conditions were not stringently uniform. The ﬁbers were also stored for
varying durations in clean glass tubes and could come into light contact with the
inner surface of the tubes. Depending on the storage time or amount of contact,
some deviation in ds can be expected.

Figure 2 shows how strongly diﬀerent treatments aﬀected the surface of ﬁbers.
Most of the treatments either produced no change in the condition of the surface
or they made it only slightly worse. However, pinching the surface at regular
(1 cm) intervals with calipers signiﬁcantly increased the dissipation depth, possibly
due to small cracks formed by the mechanical contact. Similarly, the mechanically
polished microscope slide had the highest measured ds. It is interesting to note that
the surface of Fiber I, after being signiﬁcantly damaged by calipers, was restored
to a condition better than as drawn (or perhaps more appropriately better than
“as stored and handled”) by the 45 µm HF etch. The resulting dissipation depth
agrees with the best as drawn case, having a value of about 100 µm.

The question arises why most samples undergoing HF etches did not show sig-
niﬁcant surface improvement. In the case of the severely damaged slide, we believe

a Change in ds from the as drawn or as supplied state. The un-
certainty in ∆ds is not the root of the quadratic sum of uncer-
tainties in ds since not all the variables involved in calculating
ds are independent between treatments.

the etch was too shallow. After etching, hairline scratches on the slide were visible
to the naked eye. Etching opens up microscopic cracks imparted by the polishing
process and their presence, post-etch, is evidence that the surface was still dam-
aged. As for the ﬁber etches, only one (the etch of Fiber I) resulted in an improved
dissipation depth. This may be due to the fact that Fiber I had an as drawn dissipa-
tion depth somewhat higher than any other ﬁber and may have been inadvertently
damaged between drawing and installation in our apparatus. Mechanical damage
can be repaired by HF etching3, 4 (though the etches must be suﬃciently deep).
The HF etch may thus have removed the damaged surface of Fiber I, reducing the
dissipation depth from the initially measured value.

We should not neglect the possibility that chemical contamination of the surface,
in particular contamination with atmospheric water,4 may also lead to increased
loss. The ubiquity of ds values in the range 100-200 µm could be due to the diﬃculty
of isolating samples from atmospheric water. This would also explain the failure of
the etches to reduce the dissipation depth below this range.

IV SURFACE LOSS DUE TO OPTICAL COATING

The surface loss due to optical coatings was investigated by measuring the quality
factors of the modes of fused silica slides. We measured the Qs for three slides

1 mm. The slides were suspended below a
monolithic, fused-silica isolation system, as shown in Fig. 1b. The slides’ vibration
was monitored by positioning the LED and shadow sensor around the suspending
ﬁber directly above the slide.

Two of the three slides, A and B, were optically coated while the third slide,
C, was retained uncoated as a control. (Slide C was later etched as reported in
the preceding section.) As supplied, the slides had received a commercial 80-50
polish. The optical coating applied to Slide A and Slide B was a high-reﬂective
(HR) coating 2.4 µm thick consisting of 14 layers of alternating SiO2 and Ta2O5.
The slides were coated by ion beam sputtering in the same coating run as optics
for LIGO by Research Electro-Optics in Boulder Colorado. After the coating run
they were baked at 450◦C to relieve stress.

The quality factors for each measured resonant mode of slides A and B and equiv-
alent dissipation depths are shown in Table 2. The quality factors and equivalent
dissipation depths for the measured modes of the uncoated Slide C (as supplied)
are given for comparison.

The coated Slide B was suspended from the center of one of its short edges, as
shown in Fig. 1b. When the supporting ﬁber was connected to the slide using
a hydrogen-oxygen torch the coating became visibly damaged. Where the ﬂame
from the torch contacted the coating, the coating took on a milky appearance. This
occurred in a crescent shape approximately 3 mm across at the top of the slide. The
high value of ds for the second mode is believed to be due to this damage. To test
this, the top 5 mm of this slide were immersed in a 50% solution (by weight) of HF
and water for about 6 hours. Rinses with distilled water were applied periodically
to remove ﬂakes of the coating. The etch removed most of the damaged part of the

coating and the Q was re-measured. The Q and dissipation depth of the second
mode was now of the same magnitude as that measured for the third mode and for
all modes of Slide B.

The coated Slide A was hung from a corner rather than from the center of the
top edge. This was because, in the corner, the fused silica substrate was masked
(by the supports) during the coating process. This left a region with no optical
coating about 1 mm in radius and centered on the corner. The ﬁber was very
carefully welded to the slide at this point. While some heat from the torch certainly
reached the coated region, no damage to the coating could be seen afterwards. Both
modes of Slide A showed similar Qs and similar dissipation depths as the modes
of Slide B after the damaged region was removed. Since the uncoated Slide C
has signiﬁcantly less dissipation than the coated slides, and since the coated slides
all show approximately the same level of dissipation, we conclude that the high
dissipation depth associated with the coated slides, ds
3 cm, is a result of the
HR optical coating.

≈

If our measurements are characteristic of the coatings for LIGO, this would lead
to noticeably increased thermal noise for the LIGO test masses. However, the
surfaces of the slides did not receive the same treatment prior to the coating as
the LIGO test masses. They were not superpolished and no particular eﬀorts were
made to ensure the absolute cleanliness of the surfaces.
It is possible that the
interface between the coating and the silica is more lossy than a polished surface
interface would be. Superpolished samples of fused silica have been obtained and
research is continuing to determine the loss in superpolished and coated samples.

V IMPLICATIONS FOR THERMAL NOISE

Surface loss in the ﬁlaments suspending LIGO test masses could have implications
for the interferometer noise budget.5 Surface loss associated with ﬁbers implies a
lower limit on the level of pendulum mode thermal noise achievable using thin
ribbon suspensions. While dissipation dilution implies reduced pendulum mode

thermal noise as the ribbon thickness is reduced, the eﬀects of surface loss are
increased. The result is a diameter independent lower limit for the pendulum mode

While this is suﬃcient for the goals of LIGO II, it is clear from the dependence on ds
that mechanical surface damage such as is induced by calipers must be prevented.
Surface loss due to optical coatings may signiﬁcantly increase the thermal noise
due to internal modes of the test masses. To relate the dissipation depth measured
for an optical coating to the internal mode thermal noise we follow the work of
Levin6 and Bondu et al .7 This enables an approximate calculation of the relevant µ.

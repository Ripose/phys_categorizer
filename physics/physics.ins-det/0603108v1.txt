We demonstrate feedback control optimization for the Stark deceleration and trapping of neutral
polar molecules using evolutionary strategies. In a Stark-decelerator beamline pulsed electric ﬁelds
are used to decelerate OH radicals and subsequently store them in an electrostatic trap. The
eﬃciency of the deceleration and trapping process is determined by the exact timings of the applied
electric ﬁeld pulses. Automated optimization of these timings yields an increase of 40 % of the
number of trapped OH radicals.

INTRODUCTION

Analogous to the interaction of charged particles with
electric ﬁelds in a linear accelerator [1], the interaction of
neutral polar molecules with electric ﬁeld gradients can
be used in a Stark decelerator [2] to accelerate, deceler-
ate or guide a molecular beam. Using arrays of electric
ﬁeld electrodes that are switched to high-voltage at ap-
propriate times, bunches of state-selected molecules with
a computer-controlled velocity and with a low longitudi-
nal temperature can be produced. This is of advantage
in any molecular beam experiment where the velocity
distribution of the molecules is an important parameter.
When combined with an electrostatic trap, the Stark-
deceleration technique oﬀers the possibility to conﬁne
rovibronic ground-state molecules for times up to sec-
onds [3, 4]. This holds great promise for the study of
molecular interactions at the high densities and the (ul-
tra) low temperatures that can ultimately be achieved [5].

The eﬃciency of the deceleration and trap-loading pro-
cess critically depends on the exact timings of the high-
voltage pulses.
In a typical deceleration and trapping
experiment a sequence of more than one hundred high-
voltage pulses is applied to the various elements in the
beamline. The timesequence that is used is inferred from
a detailed knowledge of the electric ﬁelds in the decelera-
tor and trap region, and the Stark eﬀect of the molecule
of interest. This, however, does not account for possi-
ble deviations from an idealized description of the ex-
periment, like, for instance, misalignments of the elec-
trode arrays and instabilities of the applied high-voltage
pulses. Furthermore, these calculations are based on a
one-dimensional model to describe the longitudinal mo-

tion, while the transverse motion of the molecule eﬀects
the eﬃciency of the decelerator [6]. A manual optimiza-
tion of the timesequence is practically impossible for this
complicated and large parameter space. Here, we demon-
strate the successful implementation of an evolutionary
algorithm for the automated optimization of a Stark-
decelerator beamline.

Evolutionary algorithms (EA), mimicking the biolog-
ical principles of evolution, have been frequently used
for automatic optimization of experimental problems
with a large parameter space and noisy feedback signals.
As early as the 1960’s three independent developments
started with the introduction of evolutionary strategies
(ES) by Rechenberg and Schwefel [7–9], evolutionary pro-
gramming (EP) by Fogel, Owens and Walsh [10, 11], and
genetic algorithms (GA) by Holland [12, 13]. A nice in-
troduction to the ﬁeld of evolutionary computing and its
diﬀerent dialects is given by Eiben and Smith [14].

In many branches of atomic and molecular physics
feedback control experiments have been performed, see
for example reference 15, and references therein. Since
the proposal [16] and application [17] of learning loops
to optimize femtosecond laser pulse shapes [18] for the
control of quantum dynamics in the 1990’s, a large num-
ber of experiments on the coherent control of atomic and
molecular dynamics have been performed [19–21].

In this work we use evolutionary strategies for the feed-
back control optimization of the timesequence of high-
voltage pulses that are applied to the Stark decelerator
and trap. The experiments have been performed using
a pulsed molecular beam of OH radicals in the low-ﬁeld
seeking X 2Π3/2, v = 0, J = 3/2, M Ω = −9/4 state, for
which Stark deceleration [22] and electrostatic trapping
[4] had previously been demonstrated. The automated
optimization results in an increase of up to 40 % of the
number of trapped OH radicals.

FIG. 1: Scheme of the experimental set-up. A pulsed beam
of OH radicals with a mean velocity of 360 m/s is produced
via ArF-laser photodissociation of HNO3 seeded in Xe. The
molecules pass through a skimmer, a hexapole, and a Stark
decelerator and are subsequently conﬁned in an electrostatic
trap. State-selective LIF detection is performed inside the
trap. A schematic representation of the timesequence of high-
voltage pulses is shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure, including
selected indices of the switching times; see text for details.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. Stark deceleration and trapping

Molecules possessing an electric dipole moment will
gain Stark energy upon entering an electric ﬁeld, when
in an appropriate quantum state. This gain in Stark en-
ergy is compensated by a loss in kinetic energy. If the
electric ﬁeld is switched oﬀ before the molecules have left
the ﬁeld, they will not regain the lost kinetic energy. In
a Stark decelerator [2, 23], this process is repeated by
letting the molecules pass through multiple switchable
electric ﬁeld stages. In this way, molecules can be decel-
erated and brought to a standstill.

The experimental setup is schematically shown in
Fig. 1, and is described in detail elsewhere [24]. In brief, a
pulsed beam of OH radicals is produced by photodissoci-
ation of HNO3 that is co-expanded with Xe from a pulsed
solenoid valve. The mean velocity of the beam is around
360 m/s with a velocity spread (FWHM) of 15 %. After
the supersonic expansion, most of the OH radicals in the
beam reside in the lowest rotational (J = 3/2) level in the
vibrational and electronic ground state X 2Π3/2, v = 0.
The molecular beam passes through a skimmer with a
2 mm diameter opening and is transversely focused into
the Stark decelerator using a short pulsed hexapole. The
Stark decelerator consists of an array of 109 equidistant
pairs of electrodes, with a center to center distance of
11 mm. The decelerator is operated using a voltage dif-
ference of 40 kV between opposing electrodes, creating a
maximum electric ﬁeld strength on the molecular beam

2

axis of about 90 kV/cm. A kinetic energy of 0.9 cm−1 is
extracted from the OH molecules per deceleration stage
(the region between adjacent pairs of electrodes), and
part of the beam is decelerated from 371 to 79 m/s after
101 stages.
In the remainder of this paper, these ﬁrst
101 stages will be referred to as decelerator 1. The last 7
stages of the decelerator, referred to as decelerator 2, are
electronically and mechanically decoupled from decelera-
tor 1, and are used at a lower voltage diﬀerence of 30 kV.
Here, the molecules are decelerated further to a velocity
of 21 m/s, prior to the loading of the packet into the
electrostatic trap. The trap consists of two hyperbolic
endcaps and a ring electrode. To load the molecules into
the trap its electrodes are switched from an initial load-
ing conﬁguration to a trapping conﬁguration. The load-
ing conﬁguration creates a potential hill that is higher
than the kinetic energy of the molecules. The OH rad-
icals therefore come to a standstill while ﬂying into the
trap. At this moment the electrodes are switched to the
trapping conﬁguration, creating a ﬁeld minimum in the
center of the trap.

The number of trapped OH radicals as well as the tem-
perature of the trapped gas critically depends on the de-
tails of the trap-loading sequence, and in particular on
the velocity with which the molecules enter the trap [4].
If this velocity is chosen such that the molecules come to
a standstill exactly at the center of the trap (v= 15 m/s),
a distribution corresponding to a temperature of 50 mK
can be reached. If this velocity is larger, the molecules
come to a standstill past the center of the trap, and the
ﬁnal temperature is higher. The reduced spreading out
of a faster beam while ﬂying from the last stage of the
decelerator to the trap, however, results in a larger num-
ber of trapped molecules. The velocity of 21 m/s and
the subsequent trap-loading sequence that is used as ref-
erence for the optimization in the present experiment is
identical to the trap-loading that was used in previous
OH trapping experiments [4]. It results in a temperature
of the trapped molecular packet of about 450 mK, an es-
timated number density of 107 − 108 molecules per cm3,
and a trapping lifetime of 1.6 s.

The OH radicals are state-selectively detected in the
trap using a laser induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) detection
scheme. The 282 nm UV radiation of a pulsed dye laser
excites the A 2Σ+, v = 1 ←− X 2Π3/2, v = 0 transition.
A photomultiplier tube (PMT) is used to measure the re-
sulting oﬀ-resonant ﬂuorescence. In the experiments re-
ported here the repetition rate of the experiment is 10 Hz
and for every datapoint 64 successive measurements are
averaged. The signal-to-noise ratio of the trapping ex-
periment under these conditions is about twenty.

B. Feedback control optimization

As described in section II A the individual timings in
the timesequences applied to the machine are very criti-
cal. Generally, initial timesequences are calculated based

on a theoretical model of the experiment and will be re-
ferred to as calculated timesequences throughout this ar-
ticle.

For the feedback control optimization the LIF intensity
of trapped OH molecules, as described above, is used. To
avoid eﬀects from the oscillations of the molecular packet
inside the trap that appear during the ﬁrst milliseconds
after switching on the trap (see Fig. 3 of [4] and Fig. 4
of this manuscript), the LIF intensity is measured af-
ter 20 ms trapping-time. This measurement of the OH
density in the trap is used as objective function (ﬁtness)
in the feedback control algorithm. Since the lifetime of
the OH radicals conﬁned in the trap is as long as 1.6 s,
the number of detected OH molecules after 20 ms is still
> 98 % of the maximum value. Because the LIF signal at
that detection time is practically constant over periods
much longer than the timing changes due to the feed-
back control algorithm (≪ 1 ms), pulsed laser excitation
at a ﬁxed time can be applied for the molecule detection.
Note, that in the feedback control loop implemented here,
we use the result from previous experimental runs as feed-
back for following ones.

This given problem requires the optimization in a large
parameter space, which at the same time can only be
sampled by a slow and noisy evaluation. For such prob-
lems evolutionary algorithms are generally a good choice
and have been applied successfully in many ﬁelds. The
individual parameters to be adjusted are the timings ti
that determine the exact switching of the high-voltages
energizing the deceleration and trapping electrodes. For
the given experiment this results in 111 parameters to be
optimized. For a detailed depiction of the timing num-
bering see Fig. 1. To reduce the high dimensionality of
the parameter space, we retracted from optimizing all pa-
rameters individually, but encoded them in three reduced
sets of parameters: The timings of decelerator 1 and the
ﬁrst 4 timings of decelerator 2 are not optimized inde-
pendently, but described by two sets of polynomial ex-
pansion coeﬃcients. We found that an accurate encoding
of the timesequence itself requires a polynomial of high
order, i. e. orders larger than twenty for a 5 µs accuracy.
To allow for smaller polynomial orders o1 and o2 for the
two parts of the decelerator, we have only encoded the
diﬀerences to the calculated timesequence ti − ti,0 in the
polynomial, allowing for considerably smaller expansions,
since they only need to describe deviations from the the-
oretical timings. For decelerator 1 one obtains timings ti
with i = 1–102

ti = ti,0 +

and for decelerator 2 timings ti with i = 103–106

ti = ti,0 +

pj+o1+2 · (i − 103)j

The remaining 5 timings ti for the last deceleration stages
and the trap-loading and trapping conﬁgurations, which

are the most critical timings, are optimized individually
and independently. To decouple them from the changes
of earlier timings, they are encoded as time diﬀerence to
their respective preceding timing, i. e. we use

∆ti = ti − ti−1 = pi+o1+o2−104

(3)

for i = 107–111. The complete parameter vector used in
the optimization is then encoded as

~P = (p1, p2, . . . po1+o2+7)T ∈

R+
(cid:0)

o1+o2+7
(cid:1)

(4)

Typically we have used polynomials of order o1 = 2 for
decelerator 1 and order o2 = 1 for decelerator 2, resulting
in a parameter vector of length ten. In this way the di-
mension of the parameter space is reduced by one order
of magnitude compared to the initial one, while control
over the whole beamline with the feedback loop is main-
tained.

With the intuitive representation of the individuals of
the optimization problem as a vector of real numbers over
a continuous parameter space, the choice of evolutionary
strategies is an natural one. ES is a EA dialect that uses
a representation of real-valued vectors and generally uses
self-adaptivity [14]. In the experiments described here we
used the Evolving Object (EO) framework [25, 26] imple-
mentation of the ES. As a trade-oﬀ between problem size
in the ES and theoretical convergence, the eoEsStdev ES
strategy, applying uncorrelated mutations with individ-
ual step sizes, was used [14, section 4.4.2]. In this self-
adaptive strategy the genotype is a vector of real numbers
containing the actual optimization parameters as well as
individual mutation widths σi for every parameter pi.

The initial optimization meta-parameters used were
based on the suggestions by Eiben and Smith [14] and
successively adopted according to their success in the ex-
periments. In the most successful optimization runs the
following parameters were used: typically a population
size of ﬁve or ten individuals was used, with population
sizes up to forty in some runs. Typically thirty oﬀsprings
were generated every generation, with values ranging
from the actual population size to six times the popu-
lation size over diﬀerent runs. Generally, an oﬀspring-to-
population ratio of seven is assumed to work best, but
the theoretical advantage is apparently outweighed by
the slowness of the evaluation and the corresponding ex-
perimental diﬃculties in this experiment. The most suc-
cessful mutation and crossover rates were 75 % and 50 %,
respectively, but this seems not to be critical and was not
tested extensively. Parent selection was done using the
ordered sequential selector. We have used discrete global
recombination for the experimental parameters and in-
termediate global recombination for the mutation widths
σ. For survivor selection the (λ, µ) approach worked best,
as it seems to handle noise and drifts in the experimental
conditions well, as is generally assumed [14, section 4.7].
Elitism was not applied.

This machine learning is implemented in our data-
acquisition system (KouDA) using ES within an auto-
matic feedback control loop.

FIG. 2: (Color Online): For three diﬀerent optimization runs,
each with diﬀerent initial parameters, the normalized average
ﬁtness per generation is plotted. Curve A (squares) and B (as-
terisks) show an increase of 30 and 40 %, respectively. During
the measurement represented by curve C (triangles) drifts in
the experimental conditions, namely the backing pressure of
the supersonic expansion, occurred and lead to reduced signal
intensities, as was conﬁrmed after the optimization run.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In Fig. 2 the normalized average ﬁtness — the LIF
signal from OH radicals in the trap — per generation
is plotted against the generation number for three dif-
ferent optimization runs, referred to as runs A, B, and
C. The measured ﬁtness-values are normalized with re-
spect to the ﬁtness obtained for the calculated timese-
quence under the same experimental conditions. In each
run, diﬀerent strategy parameters for the algorithm or
diﬀerent initial populations are used, as detailed below.
Typically, a complete optimization run corresponds to
the evaluation of many hundred generated timesequences
and takes about 1–2 hours of measuring time. In run A
(squares), the calculated timesequence is used as start-
ing point for the optimization. From this sequence, an
initial population is created with parameters that are
randomly picked out of a Gaussian distribution around
the calculated values. The last parameter, ∆t111, has
been decreased by 27 µs based on the outcome of earlier
runs (not presented). As a result of these small changes,
the ﬁrst generation has a slightly lower ﬁtness. After 9
generations the average ﬁtness of the generation has in-
creased to the value of the calculated timesequence. For
later generation numbers the ﬁtness increases further and
reaches a maximum of 1.3 after 46 generations. In the
measurement represented by curve B (asterisks) an initial
population was created from the same calculated timese-
quence, but 9 out of 10 parameters were set oﬀ by 3 to
20 %. Hence, the ﬁrst generation timesequences lead to a
normalized ﬁtness of less than 0.1. After 11 generations

4

this number already reaches 1 and is further optimized
to 1.4 in generation 37. The optimization runs A and
B result in a number of trapped OH radicals that is 30
to 40 % higher than the number that is obtained with
the calculated timesequence. Other experiments where
diﬀerent initial populations were chosen led to a similar
increase in the number of trapped molecules.

The initial population and strategy parameters, that
are used in the optimization run shown in curve C (tri-
angles), are very similar to the parameters that were used
in curve A. Curve C initially shows (as expected) an opti-
mization similar to that of run A and reaches a maximum
of 1.2 after around 9 generations. From then on, how-
ever, the ﬁtness starts decreasing. This is due to a drift in
the production of OH radicals during this experimental
run, that was conﬁrmed by an independent measurement
after the optimization run. In spite of this drift the algo-
rithm still converged and the timesequences obtained for
the last generation are comparable with timesequences
obtained in runs A and B (vide infra).

Other experiments using diﬀerent strategy parameters
for the ES, for example, diﬀerent population sizes or dif-
ferent settings for mutation and crossover rates, did lead
to a similar increase in the number of trapped molecules
of 35–40 %. Furthermore, the values of corresponding
parameters from the optimized timesequences are gen-
erally comparable. These results show not only that
the algorithm is able to optimize the number of trapped
molecules, but also that it ﬁnds a reproducible maximum
in the parameter-space, even if the initial parameters de-
viate signiﬁcantly or external factors disturb the experi-
ment.

The evolutions of three of the most important param-
eters, recorded during optimization run A, are shown in
Fig. 3. Fig. 3 a and 3 b show ∆t108 and ∆t109, respec-
tively. These parameters deﬁne the switching times of
the last two stages of decelerator 2 and thus determine
the exact velocity with which the molecules leave the de-
celerator. Fig. 3 c depicts the evolution of ∆t111, the
time interval during which the loading conﬁguration of
the trap is used. At the end of this time interval the
trapping conﬁguration is switched on. For reference, the
horizontal lines in the plots denote the mean value of
the respective parameter in the ﬁrst generation, which
are equivalent to the parameters in the calculated time-
sequence. Although the ﬁtness depends very critically
on these speciﬁc timings, the evolution of the parameters
shown in Fig. 3 is typical for the evolution of less critical
parameters as well.

For all three parameters, the mutation widths σ, rep-
resented by the vertical bars, are initially large and the
parameters scatter over a relatively large range. As the
generation number increases, this mutation width de-
creases and the parameters converge. Parameter ∆t111,
however, converges initially to two values, one centered
around 1662 µs, the other around 1674 µs. This shows
that the parameter-space contains multiple local max-
ima, and that multiple pathways in the parameter-space

can be followed. Only after 27 generations, exclusively
individuals with a value for ∆t111 of about 1674 µs sur-
vive the selection.

From each feedback control experiment a set of op-
timized timesequences is obtained. It is clear from the
optimized timesequences, that no diﬀerent mode of op-
eration for the Stark decelerator is obtained and that
the previous theoretical understanding [23] is conﬁrmed
by these experiments. Moreover, comparing the time-
of-ﬂight (TOF) proﬁles of OH radicals at the center of
the trap, that are measured using the calculated and op-
timized timesequences, a physical interpretation of the
diﬀerences can be deduced. The typical result of such
a measurement is shown in Fig. 4. The black and gray

timesequences, respectively. The lower two curves show
the TOF proﬁles of the OH molecules as they arrive in the
trap when no voltages are applied to the trap electrodes.
The positions and widths of the arrival-time distributions
are a measure for the longitudinal velocity distributions
of the decelerated OH beams that exit the decelerator.
Compared to the calculated timesequence, the optimized
sequence results in an arrival-time distribution that is
shifted 180 µs to the left, indicating that the molecular
packet arrives with a higher mean velocity of 25 m/s, in-
stead of 21 m/s, in the trap. Assuming the transverse
and longitudinal velocity spreads are unaltered for the
optimized timesequence, the beam spreads out less in all
directions while traveling the distance from the end of the
decelerator to the trap, and the corresponding arrival-
time distribution is narrower. The integral of the peak of
the arriving packet (lower curves) is already enhanced by
about 40 %, reﬂecting the reduced transverse spreading
out of the beam and hence the reduced transverse losses
while entering the trap.

The upper two curves show the density of OH radi-
cals at the center of the trap when the trap-loading and
trapping electric ﬁelds are applied. The optimized time-
sequence (gray curve) leads to a more pronounced oscil-
lation in the TOF proﬁle than the calculated one (black
curve). This is readily understood from the higher ini-
tial velocity of the molecules. The molecules enter the
trap too fast, and come to a standstill past the center

of the trap. The molecular packet is poorly matched to
the trap acceptance, and the width of the velocity distri-
bution of the trapped molecules will therefore be higher
as well. These results conﬁrm, as was already concluded
earlier [4], that a large number of molecules in the trap
and a low temperature of the trapped packet of molecules
are conﬂicting goals with the present design of the trap:
the required low velocity to match the decelerated molec-
ular packet with the acceptance of the trap results in a
large transverse spreading out of the packet prior to en-
tering the trap.

In principle, one could also aim a feedback control op-
timization at determining a timesequence for a trapped
molecular packet with a temperature as low as possi-
ble, or a weighted combination of the number of trapped
molecules and a minimal temperature, by using an ap-
propriate experimental objective function. One could, for
example, measure the number of molecules at the center
of the trapping region after a predeﬁned time of free ex-
pansion of a previously trapped packet. That would re-
sult in a combined determination of the peak density of
the trapped molecular packet and its temperature, where
the time delay between switching oﬀ the trap and the
detection of the molecular density would weigh the two
contributions to the ﬁtness. Alternatively, if the spa-
tial density distribution of the trapped molecular packet
would be measured for every generated timesequence, di-
rect information on the number of trapped molecules and
their temperature is obtained, allowing to deﬁne any ob-
jective function based on these two important measures.
Furthermore, when using continuous detection to allow
for measuring the complete time-of-ﬂight proﬁle from the
nozzle to the detection region for every molecular packet,
the integrated intensity and the longitudinal temperature
can be deduced oﬄine by the optimization algorithm [30].
This allows to optimize any Stark-decelerator beamline,
even without trapping.

Besides the timings of the high-voltage pulses one can
also optimize other computer controllable experimental
parameters, such as the voltages that are applied to the
experiment, laser frequencies, etc. In general, evolution-
ary algorithms can be used for the optimization of any
ﬁtness function that can be determined experimentally.
This includes,
the ratio of molecules
simultaneously trapped in two diﬀerent quantum

for example,

6

states or the ratio of decelerated and actually trapped
molecules. More generally, the method can also be ap-
plied to other atomic and molecular beam experiments,
such as optimizing the timings or voltages in multi-
pole focusers [27] or the currents in a Zeeman slower [28].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we describe the successful implementa-
tion of feedback control optimization of the Stark decel-
eration and trapping of OH radicals using evolutionary
strategies. The timesequence of high-voltage pulses that
is applied to the decelerator and trap electrodes is en-
coded as parameter vector for the algorithm. Starting
from an initial timesequence based on an idealized rep-
resentation of the beamline, the number of trapped OH
radicals is increased by 40 %. This enhancement is qual-
itatively understood in terms of the improved coupling
in of the amount of molecules into the trap.

The machine learning approach presented here can be
applied to other Stark-deceleration experiments as well.
The optimization will be especially useful for all experi-
ments in which very slow molecular beams (v < 100 m/s)
are manipulated, for which the exact switching times of
the high-voltage pulses are extremely critical.
In gen-
eral, any computer-controllable experimental parameter
can be optimized using evolutionary algorithms and any
ﬁtness function that can be determined experimentally
can be used as ﬁtness for the optimization.

Essential to the present experiment is the use of
trapped molecules, which enables the decoupling of the
timing for pulsed laser detection from the optimization.
For beamlines with continuous detection such a timing
can be evaluated oﬄine and becomes uncritical, thus
making feedback control optimization generally applica-
ble.

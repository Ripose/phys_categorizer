with Large Area Avalanche Photodiodes
(LAAPDs)

Abstract

Large Area Avalanche Photodiodes (LAAPDs) were used for a series of systematic
measurements of the scintillation light in Ar, Kr, and Xe gas. Absolute quantum
eﬃciencies are derived. Values for Xe and Kr are consistent with those given by
the manufacturer. For the ﬁrst time we show that argon scintillation (128 nm) can
be detected at a quantum eﬃciency above 40%. Low-pressure argon gas is shown
to emit signiﬁcant amounts of non-UV radiation. The average energy expenditure
for the creation of non-UV photons in argon gas at this pressure is measured to be
below 378 eV.

Key words: Avalanche Photodiode, LAAPD, DUV detection, quantum eﬃciency,

1 Introduction

Noble gases are known to provide scintillation light with high yield, compa-
rable to that of NaI(Tl). Detection of this light proves fundamental in many
applications in which noble gas is used as medium (for example in TPCs the
prompt scintillation light is used for triggering and T0 determination). Dif-
ﬁculties arise from the fact that noble gas emission is peaked in the deep
ultraviolet (DUV) range. To detect such light, wavelength shifter-coated Pho-
tomultiplier Tubes (PMTs) have often been used, resulting in a very low global
quantum eﬃciency. There is interest in knowing if large area avalanche photo-
diodes (LAAPDs) could be a viable alternative, in particular in applications
where the radiopurity of the PMT’s glass is a concern (e.g. direct dark matter
searches, detection of solar neutrinos, etc.).

The results presented in this paper show that it is in principle possible to detect
gas scintillation from Kr, Xe and Ar with APDs with a quantum eﬃciency
higher than with PMTs. The issues related to the signal to noise of APDs, to
the parallel operation of a large number of APDs to increase the sensitive area
and the mechanical problems at potential cryogenic temperatures remain to
be solved.

2 Noble Gas Scintillation

Gas excitation and ionization can lead to the emission of scintillation photons
in the DUV range via the processes [1] of excitation

and ionization

The possible emission of non-UV light, mostly in the IR region, is attributed
to the transitions between excited atomic states. Indeed, the atomic spectrum
of argon shows several very intense lines at wavelength 700-1050 nm. A set of
lines located between 400-500nm has intensities below 3 % of the most intense
lines found in the infrared region.

According to [3,4,5,6], the average energy expended per ion pair W ion
related to the ionization potential I

where Ni is the number of ions produced at an average energy expenditure of
Ei, Nex is the number of excited atoms produced at an average expenditure of
Eex, and ǫ is the average kinetic energy of sub-excitation electrons. Equation 3
can also be applied to condensed noble gas if I is substituted by the band-gap
energy Eg. Values used for calculations in this work are shown in Table 1.

The energy balance equation is energy dependent in all four every terms,
however, for E ≫ I this dependence is weak. For α-particles in argon, W ion

is reduced. Our measurements were performed in a pressure range where the
scintillation is brought forth by α particles with at least 0.5 MeV kinetic
energy.

3 Experimental Set-Up

In our experimental setup (See Figure 1), we used an 241Am source which emits
α-particles of an initial energy of 5.486 MeV (85%) and 5.443 MeV (13%). For
the measurements, α-particles pass from an open 241Am source to an APD
employed as a trigger. The triggered trajectories necessarily pass through the
noble gas, causing scintillation. An APD mounted on an axis perpendicular to
the trajectory detects this light. The set of trajectories are contained within
a cylindrical region of 1.5mm radius and 45mm length. The trigger is simply
an APD operated in unitary gain mode.

The APDs are Advanced Photonix LAAPDs with an active diameter of 16mm
[8]. For scintillation light detection a windowless, DUV-enhanced device was
used primarily, cross-checked against a windowless Red/IR-enhanced device.

To perform measurements, the dewar is evacuated to about 10−5 mbar, ﬂushed
a few times, and ﬁlled with the noble gas in which the measurement is to be
performed. For the measurements in argon, the gas is puriﬁed by an Oxysorb
cartridge. The condition that the α deposits at least 0.5 MeV in the trigger

imposes a gas-dependent upper limit on the pressures at which the measure-
ments could be performed. A lower bound is given by the electrical discharge-
tendency encountered at low pressures. External cooling allows a gas temper-
ature range from −5 to 20 degrees C. Thermistors monitor the temperature
of the gas as well as of the APD, the latter being of importance due to the
temperature dependence of APD gain.

A schematic of the electronics is shown in Figure 2. Directly outside the dewar,
the APD signals are decoupled and ampliﬁed using a ICARUS charge-sensitive
hybrid preampliﬁer [9]. The feedback capacitance of the preampliﬁer is mod-
iﬁed to 5.7 pF in order to be better adapted to the large capacitance of the
APD. The preampliﬁed signal is shaped and ampliﬁed by a Canberra 2020
Spectroscopy Ampliﬁer.

The signal height is obtained by comparison with a test pulse, consisting of a
pulse generator injecting a charge via a capacitor of known capacitance. Mea-
suring the current ﬂowing through the APD allows the gain to be monitored
according to the method described in [10], where a LED situated inside the
dewar serves as a continuous light source.

Typical signals are shown in Figure 3.

Fig. 3. Plot shows typical signals with 5 µs (left) and 10 µs shaping time (right).
Time samples correspond to 400 ns each. The signals were randomly picked from
the data taken in argon at 0.783 atm and 0.777 atm respectively, see Table 4 for
more information about the conditions under which the data was acquired.

The raw charge QS of measured signals is obtained by comparison with a test
pulse

ST P
where SS, ST P are the peak heights of the signal and the test pulses, respec-
tively. The precision of the measurement depends crucially on the knowledge
of the amount of charge QT P = VT P · CT P that the test pulse injects into the
preampliﬁer. A pulse generator produces step functions of height VT P . VT P is
on the scale of several millivolts and can be determined with a precision better
than 2%. CT P is of the order of 5 pF. Its value can be measured more precisely

to be 3.65 ±0.05 eV [11,6],

5 Estimation of Absolute Photon Yield

W DU V
, the amount of energy necessary for the creation of a DUV scintillation
γ
photon in the given gas can be calculated from Equation 4 (See Section 2).
Dividing the α-particle’s total energy loss in gas by this number gives an upper
limit to the number of DUV photons. Quenching, or any unaccounted degree
of freedom, leads to a reduction of the number of photons.

In order to correlate results from diﬀerent gases, we have developed a simula-
tion to estimate the absolute photon yield in our setup. When the α-particles
pass through the noble gas of known temperature and pressure, their energy
loss along the well deﬁned trajectory is given by [12]. We have cross-checked
our calculations of the energy loss of the α particle by increasing the gas pres-
sure to the threshold pressure above which the α loses all its energy before
reaching the trigger. The calculation accurately predicts this value. The simu-
lation assumes trajectories on straight lines. This is justiﬁed since the detour
factor, deﬁned as the ratio of the projected range to the actual length of the
α trajectory calculated in the continuous-slowing-down-approximation, is 0.98
for α particles of energies around 5.5 MeV [12]. By requiring a minimal energy
deposition of 0.5 MeV in the trigger, this uncertainty is further reduced.

The detector’s solid angle can be calculated for each point along the trajectory.
For calculation, two models were used to simulate photon emission. The ﬁrst
assumes isotropic emission of photons at each point of the α’s trajectory. The
second model assumes emission of photons in a plane perpendicular to the
trajectory as suggested by [13]. Both gave comparable numbers, Niso being
approximately 15% smaller than Nperp. Since the model of isotropic emission
ﬁts our xenon and krypton data better, Niso was assumed to be the better
model. In the following, Niso will just be referred to as Nγ.

An estimate of the non-UV light yield is more diﬃcult. Although infrared
emission has been detected in argon and xenon [14,15], quantitative data is
hard to ﬁnd in the literature. In the case of argon, we have estimated the

6

non-UV contribution (See Section 9) and checked the eﬀect on our estimation
of the quantum eﬃciency.

6 Quantum Eﬃciency

The external quantum eﬃciency of APDs, from now on referred to as quantum
eﬃciency, is deﬁned as the number of primary electron-hole pairs produced per
incident photon. The quantum eﬃciency ǫQ(λ) is a function of the wavelength
of the incident light. In Figure 4, the quantum eﬃciency of the used LAAPD
is given by the manufacturer [8].

Fig. 4. The quantum eﬃciency of the LAAPDs [8]. The DUV enhanced device
used in our measurements has a high quantum eﬃciency in the region of xenon
scintillation light.

To our knowledge, measurements of the quantum eﬃciency of these devices
for wavelengths below 150nm, speciﬁcally at the 128nm of argon scintilla-
tion light, have not been published. As a reference, the highest values for
the global quantum eﬃciency of PMTs in argon scintillation light detection
were obtained by [16]. The measurements were made using a TPB wavelength
shifting-coating, resulting in quantum eﬃciency values below 10 %. It is there-
fore quite relevant to understand the quantum eﬃciency of the APD also in
this region of the spectrum.

7 Measurements

The quantum eﬃciency can be obtained with

ǫq0(128nm) =

QS
(e · Nγ · G)

,

(7)

where e is the elementary charge, Nγ is the number of photons impinging
on the LAAPD as predicted by our simulation (See Section 5), and G is the
measured APD gain.

Equation 7 is exact for pure argon gas with emission only at 128 nm detected
by an idealized detector. Possible absorption eﬀects due to impurities in the gas
lead to eﬃciency under-estimation. Further, the employed shaping time needs
to be suﬃcient to integrate over the full characteristic light emission time.
Using an inferior shaping time leads to eﬃciency under-estimation. Competing
with this eﬀect is the non-UV contamination. The DUV-enhanced APD has
a non-zero quantum eﬃciency throughout the visible and in parts of the IR
region, see Figure 4. Therefore, any unaccounted non-UV contribution leads
to eﬃciency over-estimation. In this work, the measurement of the non-UV
photon contribution was performed only in argon.

To verify the correctness of our photon yield simulation, measurements were
taken in krypton and xenon using DUV-enhanced LAAPD. These devices’
quantum eﬃciencies are given by the manufacturer at the wavelengths of
Kr and Xe DUV-emission. Tables 2 and 3 show the measured values. Er-
rors in the last column do not include errors on N sim
. The reference value
of quantum eﬃciency given by the manufacturer is ǫDU V
(150nm) = 1.07 and
ǫDU V
(175nm) = 1.22. Our data show good agreement with the values quoted
q
by the manufacturer [8].

Following the same procedure, measurements were made in argon. The mea-
sured values are listed in Table 4.

8 Signal Length and Shaping Time

The mechanism of DUV light emission in low pressure noble gas occurs on
a time scale of several microseconds, see [13]. Therefore, not all charge is
integrated when running measurements at shaping times that optimize energy
resolution. Series of data (not listed in Table 4) were taken at diﬀerent shaping
times. The results are shown in Figure 5, where the signal height is plotted in
arbitrary units as a function of the shaping time used. The data was ﬁtted to

where τ is the shaping time in microseconds. The ﬁtted decay frequency of
p2 = 0.395µs−1 is comparable to the value p2 = 0.2 + 0.12 · p = 0.297µs−1
obtained by [13]. We conclude for argon pressures above .678 atmospheres,
the use of 10 µs shaping time guarantees the integration of at least 94% of the
full signal.

This fact is conﬁrmed by the data taken. The series taken at 5 µs shaping
time shows a clear pressure dependence, see Table 4 and Figure 6. The series
taken with 10 µs shaping time shows no systematic pressure dependence.

The energy resolution is optimized at a ﬁnite value of shaping time. For mea-
surements performed at an APD temperature of 10◦C, the best energy reso-
lution of σ/¯x = 0.085 is achieved with 2 µs shaping. As the APD temperature

the loss of resolution at long shaping times.

9 Non-UV Contribution

Non-UV emission is assumed to be emitted from atomic transitions before
dimer formation.

For argon, measurements were performed to allow the subtraction of the pos-
sible non-UV contribution. This was done by replacing the DUV-enhanced
LAAPD by a red/IR-enhanced LAAPD from the same manufacturer. The
measurements are shown in Table 5. Note that N sim
in the table represents
the number of expected DUV photons. The device, however, is not primarily
sensitive to this wavelength. Therefore, the signal normalized to the expected
number of DUV photons should not be interpreted directly as a quantum eﬃ-
ciency. Rather, this result is to be interpreted as a signiﬁcant contribution of
non-UV photons to argon scintillation light.

γ

Because of its direct production mechanism, non-UV emission should occur
on a faster time scale than DUV emission. Our non-UV measurements were

performed at 1 µs shaping time. Note from Table 5 that no systematic pressure
dependence of the non-UV signal seems to be present. This observation is
consistent with the attribution of non-UV emission to transitions between
excited atomic states which are precursors of dimer (DUV) emission.

The red/IR enhanced LAAPD has an SiO2 anti-reﬂective coating. In general,
SiO2 is opaque to UV light. It is not clear to what extent such an eﬀect
attenuates 128nm light passing through this 150 nm thin coating. We do not
a priori exclude a residual sensitivity of the red/IR enhanced device to DUV
light.

To reduce this ambiguity, a plastic foil of 0.1 mm thickness was employed,
mounted in front of the red/IR-enhanced device. It can be assumed that this
foil has no transmittance in the DUV range, and a ﬁnite transmittance in the
Red/IR range. The foil caused a signal reduction of 34%, see Table 5 . This
leads us to conclude that at least 65% of the unﬁltered signal detected with
the red/IR-enhanced LAAPD can be attributed to non-UV photons.

From now on, we use the super-index IR when referring to the red/IR-
enhanced APD. Likewise, the super-index DUV denotes the DUV-enhanced
device. The number of non-UV photons is written as N IR. Values of quantum

Using the data listed in Table 5, we can give a strict lower limit for the branch-
ing ratio N IR/N sim
of the emission of non-UV photons in argon. The number
of non-UV photons impinging on the Red/IR-enhanced LAAPD relates to the
detected charge signal in linear dependence of gain and quantum eﬃciency:

Fig. 7. The quantum eﬃciency of the DUV-enhanced LAAPD: The continuous curve
depicts the values given by the manufacturer, see Figure 4. The circles represent the
values from Tables 4, 2, and 3 at argon, krypton, and xenon emission wavelengths.
The square markers include the correction for non-UV components (see Section 9).

where the upper limit is not rigorous as quenching eﬀects due to gas impurities
have not been accounted for.

If argon non-UV emission is centered around 940 nm as measured by [14], this
would result in an in-between value of ǫDU V
(128nm) ≈ 0.58. Note that over a
large region of the IR spectrum, the ratio of ǫDU V
is relatively constant,
making ǫDU V
(128nm) relatively insensitive to the exact wavelength of peak
IR emission.

10 Conclusion

Deep ultraviolet light can be detected by LAAPDs with signiﬁcantly higher
quantum eﬃciency than by conventional means such as photomultipliers.

Our data is consistent with the fact that argon gas at low pressure emits a
signiﬁcant amount of non-UV light. A strict upper limit for the average energy

14

necessary to produce a non-UV photon in argon gas at a pressure below 1
atm is given. A lower limit cannot be given since our device is not sensitive
throughout the IR full spectrum.

The given limits for the ǫDU V
(128nm) apply for argon non-UV emission down
to 270 nm. Since impurity quenching was not considered, the lower limit of
42% is strict while the upper limit is not. For non-UV emission centered around
940 nm ǫDU V

(128nm) ≈ 58% is obtained.

Figure 7 summarizes the obtained results for argon, krypton, and xenon. Our
measurements are consistent with the manufacturer’s data where it is avail-
able. The non-UV correction was only measured for argon. For xenon and
krypton this correction is of illustrative nature only. Error bars do not in-
clude inaccuracies of N sim
, nor do they include quenching eﬀects which lead
to eﬃciency under-estimation. Our results tend to underestimate the quantum
eﬃciency. This may be attributed to the presence of UV attenuating impuri-
ties, whose presence are not considered in the calculation. If this is the case,
the eﬀect can be expected to be more severe at shorter wavelengths. In this
sense, our measurement of the quantum eﬃciency at 128 nm is to be seen as
a lower limit.

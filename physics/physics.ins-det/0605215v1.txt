We show that doubly peaked electric ﬁelds are necessary to describe grazing-angle charge collection measure-
ments of irradiated silicon pixel sensors. A model of irradiated silicon based upon two defect levels with opposite
charge states and the trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to produce a good description of the measured
charge collection proﬁles in the ﬂuence range from 0.5×1014 neq/cm2 to 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. The model cor-
rectly predicts the variation in the proﬁles as the temperature is changed from −10◦C to −25◦C. The measured
charge collection proﬁles are inconsistent with the linearly-varying electric ﬁelds predicted by the usual descrip-
tion based upon a uniform eﬀective doping density. This observation calls into question the practice of using
eﬀective doping densities to characterize irradiated silicon. The model is now being used to calibrate pixel hit
reconstruction algorithms for CMS.

1. Introduction

A silicon pixel detector [1] is currently being de-
veloped for the CMS experiment at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC). The detector will be a key
component in the reconstruction of primary and sec-
ondary vertices in the particularly harsh LHC environ-
ment characterized by large track multiplicities and
high radiation backgrounds. The innermost layer, lo-
cated at only 4 cm from the beam line, is expected to
be exposed to a 1 MeV neutron equivalent ﬂuence of
3 × 1014 neq/cm2 per year at full luminosity.

The response of the silicon sensors during the de-
tector operation is of great concern. It is well under-
stood that the intra-diode electric ﬁelds in these detec-
tors vary linearly in depth reaching a maximum value
at the p-n junction. The linear behavior is a conse-
quence of a uniform space charge density, Neﬀ, caused
by thermally ionized impurities in the bulk material.
It is well known that the detector characteristics are
aﬀected by radiation exposure, but it is generally as-
sumed that the same picture is valid after irradiation.
In fact, it is common to characterize the eﬀects of irra-
diation in terms of a varying eﬀective uniform charge
density. In [2] we have proved that this picture does
not provide a good description of irradiated silicon
In addition, it was shown that it is
pixel sensors.
possible to adequately describe the charge collection
characteristics of a heavily irradiated silicon detector
in terms of a tuned double junction model which pro-

duces a doubly peaked electric ﬁeld proﬁle across the
sensor. The modeling is supported by the evidence
of doubly peaked electric ﬁelds obtained directly from
beam test measurements and presented in [3]. The
dependence of the modeled trap concentrations upon
ﬂuence was presented in [4] and the temperature de-
pendence of the model was presented in [5]. We sum-
marize these results in this document.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 de-
scribes the experimental details, Section 3 describes
the carrier transport simulation used to interpret the
data. The tuning of the double junction model and its
resulting predictions are discussed in Section 4. The
temperature dependence of the data and model are
summarized in Section 5. The conclusions are given
in Section 6.

2. Experimental Details

The measurements were performed in the H2 beam
line of the CERN SPS in 2003/04 using 150-225 GeV
pions. The beam test apparatus is described in [6].
A silicon beam telescope [7] consisted of four modules
each containing two 300 µm thick single-sided silicon
detectors with a strip pitch of 25 µm and readout pitch
of 50 µm. The two detectors in each module were ori-
ented to measure horizontal and vertical impact co-
ordinates. A pixel hybrid detector was mounted be-
tween the second and third telescope modules on a

SNIC Symposium, Stanford, California - 3-6 April, 2006

cooled rotating stage. A trigger signal was generated
by a silicon PIN diode. The analog signals from all
detectors were digitized in a VME-based readout sys-
tem by two CAEN (V550) ADCs and one custom-built
ﬂash ADC. The entire assembly was located in an
open-geometry 3T Helmholtz magnet that produced
a magnetic ﬁeld either parallel or orthogonal to the
beam. The temperature of the tested sensors was
controlled with a Peltier cooler that was capable of
operating down to -30◦C. The telescope information
was used to reconstruct the trajectories of individual
beam particles and to achieve a precise determination
of the particle hit position in the pixel detector. The
resulting intrinsic resolution of the beam telescope was
about 1 µm.

The prototype pixel sensors are so-called “n-in-n”
devices:
they are designed to collect charge from
n+ structures implanted into n–bulk silicon using p-
spray isolation. All test devices were 22×32 arrays of
125×125 µm2 pixels that were fabricated by CiS. The
substrate, produced by Wacker, was 285 µm thick,
n-doped, diﬀusively-oxygenated ﬂoat zone silicon of
orientation h111i, resistivity 3.7 kΩ·cm and oxygen
concentration in the order of 1017 cm−3. Individual
sensors were diced from fully processed wafers after
the deposition of under-bump metalization and in-
dium bumps. A number of sensors were irradiated
at the CERN PS with 24 GeV protons. The irradia-
tion was performed without cooling or bias. The de-
livered proton ﬂuences scaled to 1 MeV neutrons by
the hardness factor 0.62 [8] were 0.5×1014 neq/cm2,
2×1014 neq/cm2 and 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. All samples
were annealed for three days at 30◦C. In order to avoid
reverse annealing, the sensors were stored at -20◦C af-
ter irradiation and kept at room temperature only for
transport and bump bonding. All sensors were bump
bonded to PSI30/AC30 readout chips [9] which allow
analog readout of all 704 pixel cells without zero sup-
pression. The PSI30 settings were adjusted to provide
a linear response to input signals ranging from zero to
more than 30,000 electrons.

3. Sensor simulation

The interpretation of the test beam data relies upon
a detailed sensor simulation that includes the model-
ing of irradiation eﬀects in silicon. The simulation,
pixelav [2, 10, 11], incorporates the following ele-
ments: an accurate model of charge deposition by
primary hadronic tracks (in particular to model delta
rays); a realistic 3-D intra-pixel electric ﬁeld map;
an established model of charge drift physics including
mobilities, Hall Eﬀect, and 3-D diﬀusion; a simula-
tion of charge trapping and the signal induced from
trapped charge; and a simulation of electronic noise,
response, and threshold eﬀects. The intra-pixel elec-
tric ﬁeld map was generated using tcad 9.0 [12] to

simultaneously solve Poisson’s Equation, the carrier
continuity equations, and various charge transport
models. A ﬁnal simulation step reformatted the sim-
ulated data into test beam format so that it could be
processed by the test beam analysis software.

The simulation was checked by comparing simu-
lated data with measured data from an unirradiated
sensor. A plot of the charge measured in a single pixel
as a function of the horizontal and vertical track im-
pact position for normally incident tracks is shown
in Fig. 1. The simulation is shown as the solid his-
togram and the test beam data are shown as solid
points. Note that the sensor simulation does not in-
clude the “punch-through” structure on the n+ im-
plants which is used to provide a high resistance con-
nection to ground and to provide the possibility of on-
wafer IV measurements. There is reduced charge col-
lection from this portion of the implant and the data
shows reduced signal in both projections at the bias
dot. Another check, shown in Table I, is the compar-
ison of the average Lorentz angle measured at several
bias voltages [6]. In both cases, reasonable agreement
is observed between measured and simulated data.

one proposed in [13], is based on the Shockley-Read-
Hall (SRH) statistics and produces an eﬀective space
charge density ρeﬀ from the trapping of free carriers
in the leakage current. The eﬀective charge density
is related to the occupancies and densities of traps as
follows,

where: ND and NA are the densities of donor and ac-
ceptor trapping states, respectively; fD and fA are the
occupied fractions of the donor and acceptor states,
respectively, and ρdopants is the charge density due to
ionized dopants (describes the resistivity of the mate-
rial before irradiation). The donor and acceptor occu-
pancies are related to the trap parameters by standard
SRH expressions

trons and holes, respectively; ni is the intrinsic den-
sity of carriers; ED, EA are the activation energies
(relative to the mid-gap energy) of the donor and ac-
ceptor states, respectively. Note that the single donor
and acceptor states model the eﬀects of many physical
donor and acceptor states making the two-trap model
an “eﬀective theory”.

The physics of the model is illustrated in Fig. 2.
The space charge density and electric ﬁeld are plot-
ted as functions of depth z for a model tuned to re-
produce the Φ = 5.9 × 1014neqcm−2 charge collec-
tion data at 150V bias. The SRH process produces
electron-hole pairs more or less uniformly across the
thickness of the sensor. As the electrons drift to the
n+ implant, the total electron current increases as z
decreases. The hole current similarly increases with
increasing z. Trapping of the mobile carriers produces
a net positive space charge density near the p+ back-
plane and a net negative space charge density near the
n+ implant. Since positive space charge density cor-
responds to n-type doping and negative space charge
corresponds to p-type doping, there are p-n junctions
at both sides of the detector. The electric ﬁeld in the
sensor follows from a simultaneous solution of Pois-
son’s equation and the continuity equations. The re-
sulting z-component of the electric ﬁeld varies with an
approximately quadratic dependence upon z having a
minimum at the zero of the space charge density and
maxima at both implants. A more detailed descrip-

4. Model tuning and results

Charge collection across the sensor bulk was mea-
sured using the “grazing angle technique” [14]. As is
shown in Fig. 3, the surface of the test sensor is ori-
ented by a small angle (15◦) with respect to the pion
beam. Several samples of data were collected with
zero magnetic ﬁeld and at temperature of −10◦C and
−25◦C. The charge measured by each pixel along the
y direction samples a diﬀerent depth z in the sen-
sor. Precise entry point information from the beam
telescope is used to produce ﬁnely binned charge col-
lection proﬁles.

The charge collection proﬁles for a sensor irradi-
ated to a ﬂuence of Φ = 5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2 and op-
erated at a temperature of −10◦C and bias voltages
of 150V and 300V are presented in Fig 4. The mea-
sured proﬁles are shown as solid dots and the simu-
lated proﬁles are shown as histograms.
In order to
investigate the applicability of the traditional picture
of type-inverted silicon after irradiation, the simulated

SNIC Symposium, Stanford, California - 3-6 April, 2006

proﬁles were generated with electric ﬁeld maps corre-
sponding to two diﬀerent eﬀective densities of accep-
tor impurities. The full histograms are the simulated
proﬁle for Neﬀ = 4.5×1012 cm−3. Note that the 300V
simulation reasonably agrees with the measured pro-
ﬁle but the 150V simulation is far too broad. The
dashed histograms show the result of increasing Neﬀ
to 24 × 1012 cm−3. At this eﬀective doping density,
the width of the simulated peak in the 150V distribu-
tion is close to correct but it does not reproduce the
“tail” observed in the data at large y. The 300V sim-
ulated distribution is far too narrow and the predicted
charge is lower than the data (note that the proﬁles
are absolutely normalized).
It is clear that a simu-
lation based upon the standard picture of a constant
density of ionized acceptor impurities cannot repro-
duce the measured proﬁles.

The same measured proﬁles and those from bias
voltages of 200V and 450V are shown in Fig. 5. They
are compared with simulations based upon the elec-
tric ﬁeld produced by the two trap model. The model
e , σA
has six free parameters (ND, NA, σD
h )
that can be adjusted. The activation energies are
kept ﬁxed to the values of [13]: ED = EV + 0.48 eV,
EA = EC − 0.525 eV where EV and EC are the en-
ergies of the valence and conduction band edges. The
electric ﬁeld map produced by each tcad run is in-
put into pixelav. The electron and hole trapping
rates, Γe and Γh, are also inputs to pixelav and are
treated as constrained parameters. Although they
have been measured [15], they are uncertain at the
20% level due to the ﬂuence uncertainty and possi-
ble annealing of the sensors. They are therefore al-
lowed to vary by as much as ±20% from their nom-

inal values. The donor concentration of the starting
material is set to 1.2 × 1012 cm−3 corresponding to a
full depletion voltage of about 70 V for an unirradi-
ated device. Because each model iteration took ap-
proximately two days, it was not possible to use stan-
dard statistical ﬁtting techniques. The parameters of
the double junction model were systematically varied
and the agreement between measured and simulated
charge collection proﬁles was judged subjectively. The
“best ﬁts” shown in this paper are probably not true
likelihood minima and the calculation of eight param-
eter error matrices is beyond available computational
resources. Adequate agreement was achieved by set-
ting the ratio of the common hole and electron cross
sections σh/σe to 0.25 and the ratio of the acceptor
and donor densities NA/ND to 0.40. There is a range
of parameters in the ND-σe space that produces rea-
sonable agreement with the measured proﬁles. The
range is shown in Fig. 6a as the solid line in the loga-
rithmic space. If the donor density becomes too small
(ND < 20×1014 cm−3), the 150V simulation produces
too much signal at large z. If the donor density be-
comes too large (ND > 50×1017 cm−3), the 300V sim-
ulation produces insuﬃcient signal at large z. Since
the simulated leakage current varies as Ileak ∝ σeND,
diﬀerent points on the allowed solid contour corre-
spond to diﬀerent leakage current. Contours of con-
stant leakage current are shown as dashed curves and
are labeled in terms of the corresponding damage pa-
rameter α where α0 = 4 × 10−17 A/cm is the expected
leakage current [16].
It is clear that the simulation
can accommodate the expected leakage current which
is smaller than the measured current by a factor of
three.

The electron and hole traps in the model should
also contribute to the trapping of signal carriers. The
contributions of these states to the eﬀective trapping
rates of electrons and holes are given by the following
expressions

Γe = ve (cid:2)σA

e NA(1 − fA) + σD

e NDfD(cid:3) ≃ veσA

e NA

(3)

Γh = vh (cid:2)σD

h ND(1 − fD) + σA

h NAfA(cid:3) ≃ vhσD

h ND

where it has been assumed that the trap occupancies
are small. Because NA/ND is assumed to be constant,
contours of constant electron trapping rate are paral-
lel to contours of constant leakage current in ND-σe
space. The best “ﬁt” of the simulation to the mea-
sured proﬁles reduced Γe to 85% of the un-annealed
trapping rate Γ0 for the nominal ﬂuence [15]. These
contours are compared with the allowed contour in
Fig. 6b. It is clear that the simulation can accommo-
date the measured trapping rate in the same region of
parameter space that maximizes the leakage current.
Figure 6b also suggests a solution to the puzzle that
the trapping rates have been shown to be unaﬀected
by the presence of oxygen in the detector bulk [15]

the standard-annealed trapping rate Γ0 for the nominal

whereas it is well-established that the space charge ef-
fects are quite sensitive to the presence of oxygen in
the material [17]. It is clear from Fig 6b that small-
cross-section trapping states can play a large role in
the eﬀective charge density but a small one in the
eﬀective trapping rates: every point on the dj44 line

0014

produces 100% of the eﬀective charge density but only
the larger cross section points contribute substantially
to the trapping rate. If the formation of the additional
small-cross-section states were suppressed by oxygen,
then ρeﬀ could be sensitive to oxygenation whereas
Γe/h would be insensitive to oxygenation. This is an-
other consequence of the observation that the occu-
pancies fD/A of the trapping states are independent
of the scale of the cross sections in the steady state
(see eq. 3). The trapping of signal carriers is not a
steady-state phenomenon and is sensitive to the scale
of the trapping cross sections.

The simulation describes the measured charge col-
lection proﬁles well both in shape and normalization.
The “wiggle” observed at low bias voltages is a sig-
nature of the doubly peaked electric ﬁeld shown in
Fig. 2. The relative signal minimum near y = 700 µm
(see Fig. 5) corresponds to the minimum of the electric
ﬁeld z-component, Ez, where both electrons and holes
travel only short distances before trapping. This small
separation induces only a small signal on the n+ side of
the detector. At larger values of y, Ez increases caus-
ing the electrons drift back into the minimum where
they are likely to be trapped. However, the holes drift
into the higher ﬁeld region near the p+ implant and
are more likely to be collected. The net induced signal
on the n+ side of the detector therefore increases and
creates the local maximum seen near y = 900 µm.

The charge collection proﬁles at T = −10◦C for sen-
sors irradiated to ﬂuences of Φ = 0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2
and Φ = 2×1014 neq/cm2 and operated at several bias
voltages are presented in Fig. 7(a-c) and Fig. 7(d-g),
respectively. The measured proﬁles, shown as solid
dots, are compared to the simulated proﬁles, shown
as histograms. Note that the “wiggle” is present at
low bias even at Φ = 0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2 which is just
above the “type-inversion” ﬂuence. This suggests that
a doubly peaked ﬁeld is present even at rather small
ﬂuences.

The double junction model can provide a reasonable
description of the lower ﬂuence charge collection pro-
ﬁles using the parameters obtained with the ﬁtting
procedure shown in Table II. We observe that the
donor trap concentration increases more rapidly with
ﬂuence than does the acceptor trap concentration.
The ratio between acceptor and donor trap concen-
trations is 0.76 at the lowest ﬂuence and decreases to
0.40 at 5.9×1014 neq/cm2. In addition, the ﬁts exclude
a linear dependence of the trap concentrations with
the irradiation ﬂuence. At Φ = 5.9×1014 neq/cm2
the cross section ratio σh/σe is set to 0.25 for both
donor and acceptor traps while at lower ﬂuences we
ﬁnd σA
e = 1 for the acceptor
and donor traps, respectively. The simulated leakage
current is approximately linear in ﬂuence, but the ra-

and Φ = 2×1014 neq/cm2. At Φ = 5.9×1014 neq/cm2,
the ﬁeld proﬁle has a minimum near the midplane of
the detector which shifts toward the p+ implant at
lower ﬂuences. The ﬁeld has maxima at the detector
implants as discussed in Section 3. Figure 8(a) shows
that a doubly peaked electric ﬁeld is necessary to de-
scribe the measured charge collection proﬁles even at
the lowest measured ﬂuence which is just beyond the
“type inversion point”. The dependence of the space
charge density upon the z coordinate is shown in Fig-
ures 2 and 9. Before irradiation the sensor is charac-
terized by a constant and positive space charge den-
sity of 1.2 × 1012 cm−3 across the sensor bulk. After a
ﬂuence of 0.5 × 1014 neq/cm2 the device shows a nega-
tive space charge density of about −1 × 1012 cm−3
for about 70% of its thickness, a compensated re-
gion corresponding to the Ez minimum and a posi-
tive space charge density close to the backplane. The
space charge density and electric ﬁeld near the p+ im-
plant increase with ﬂuence. The space charge density
is not linear in z due to the variation of the carrier
drift velocities with the electric ﬁelds.

activation energies does not accurately model the de-
pendence of the trap occupancies on leakage current.
The allowed ND-σe parameter spaces for the lower ﬂu-
ence models are much more constrained than in the
Φ=5.9×1014 neq/cm2 case and predict the expected
leakage current. The electron and hole trapping rates,
Γe and Γh are found to scale more or less linearly with
ﬂuence.

5. Temperature dependence

The temperature dependence of the charge collec-
tion proﬁles was studied by accumulating data at
T = −25◦C. The pixelav simulation includes tem-
perature dependent mobilities, diﬀusion, and trapping
rates. The tcad calculation of the electric ﬁeld map
is also based upon temperature dependent quantities
including the bandgap energy and SRH lifetimes. The
T = −25◦C charge collection proﬁles for the Φ =
2.0×1014 neq/cm2 and Φ = 5.9×1014 neq/cm2 sensors
are compared with the simulation in Fig. 10. It is clear
that the simulation correctly tracks the temperature-
dependent variations in the measured proﬁles.

charge collection measurements of irradiated silicon
pixel sensors. A model of irradiated silicon based upon
two defect levels with opposite charge states and the
trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to produce
a good description of the measured charge collection
proﬁles in the ﬂuence range from 0.5×1014 neq/cm2 to
5.9×1014 neq/cm2. The model correctly predicts the
variation in the proﬁles as the temperature is changed
from −10◦C to −25◦C.

The doubly peaked electric ﬁeld proﬁles have max-
ima near the implants and minima near the detector
midplane. This corresponds to negative space charge
density near the n+ implant and and positive space
charge density near the p+ backplane. We ﬁnd that
it is necessary to decrease the ratio of acceptor con-
centration to donor concentration as the ﬂuence in-
creases. This causes the electric ﬁeld proﬁle to become
more symmetric as the ﬂuence increases. The eﬀect
of decreasing the temperature has the opposite eﬀect
of suppressing the ﬁelds on the p+ side of the sensor
and increasing them on the n+ side.

The measured charge collection proﬁles of irradi-
ated sensors are inconsistent with the linearly-varying
electric ﬁelds predicted by the usual description based
upon a uniform eﬀective doping density. This suggests
that the correctness and the physical signiﬁcance of ef-
fective doping densities determined from capacitance-
voltage measurements are quite unclear. In addition,
we remark that the notion of partly depleted silicon
sensors after irradiation is inconsistent with the mea-
sured charge collection proﬁles and with the observed
doubly peaked electric ﬁelds.

The charge-sharing behavior and resolution func-
tions of many detectors are sensitive to the details of
the internal electric ﬁeld. A known response func-

The eﬀect of temperature on the z-component of the
simulated electric ﬁeld at Φ = 5.9 × 1014 neq/cm2 is
shown in Fig. 11 for bias voltages of 150V and 300V. It
is clear that decreasing the temperature also decreases
the ﬁelds on the p+ side of the sensor and increases
them on the n+ side.

6. Conclusions

In this paper we have shown that doubly peaked
electric ﬁelds are necessary to describe grazing-angle

tion is a key element of an optimal reconstruction
procedure. The eﬀective model described in this pa-
per is being used to calculate detailed response func-
tions that are being incorporated into a new hit recon-
struction algorithm for the CMS pixel tracking system
[18, 19]. This will permit the “calibration” of the re-
construction algorithm to be tracked as the pixels are
irradiated during LHC operation.

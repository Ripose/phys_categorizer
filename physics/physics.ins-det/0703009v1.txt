Abstract

Simulation of new generation gas detectors is rendered complicated due to
the non-trivial nature of the electric ﬁeld and simultaneous presence of several
length-scales. Computation of the electrostatic ﬁeld, however, is extremely
important since streamers in gas volume and streamers across the dielectric
surfaces are known to cause serious damage to Micro Pattern Gas Detectors
(MPGD) and are the main factors in limiting their gain.
In this paper, we
present the use of a nearly exact Boundary Element Method (neBEM) solver
that overcomes most of the limitations of FEM packages and is capable of
producing accurate results.

Introduction

Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) were conceived and built as a consequence
of natural evolution from the gas detectors of the earlier generation, namely the
Multiple Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) and its many variants. The purpose
was to achieve higher resolution, better stability and higher rate capability than
the earlier detectors. A fairly large number of MPGDs have been developed and
used since the advent of the Micro Strip Gas Chamber (MSGC) in 1988 by Oed
[1].
Importance of detailed detector simulation in general, and electrostatics in
particular, for understanding the advantages as well as the disadvantages, becomes
quite apparent if we consider the operating principle of the MPGDs many of which
also have complicated multiple dielectric conﬁguration. In this work, we will deal
with MPGDs of three popular types, namely MSGC, micro MEsh GAseous Structure
(microMEGAS) [2], and Micro Wire Detector (MWD) [3].

At present, diﬀerent steps are undertaken to carry out detailed simulation of gas
detectors. Among these, we will discuss about the very ﬁrst crucial step of comput-
ing the electrostatic ﬁeld which, in the High Energy Physics (HEP) community, is
mostly carried out using commercial package such as Maxwell [4] that uses the ﬁnite
element method (FEM) to solve for the electrostatic ﬁeld for any given geometry and
dielectric combination. In the present work, we present the neBEM solver which uses

1

a completely new formulation and foundation expressions for implementing the BIE
of electrostatics [5, 6]. Through the use of exact analytic expressions for evaluating
the inﬂuence of boundary elements, most of the drawbacks of conventional BEM
have been removed. We hope to show that the solver can be used very eﬀectively to
solve problems related to estimating the electrostatic conﬁguration of gas detectors,
in general and MPGD-s, in paritcular. Towards this end, we will present line and
surface plots of potential and ﬁeld and compare them with available results.

2 Results and discussions

To demonstrate the advantages of the neBEM solver, we are presenting results that
have been obtained with very coarse discretization, the maximum number of ele-
ments considered being less than 3500. Here, in order to present the results in the
most general terms possible, we have neither evoked symmetry, nor used any other
memory or computation time saving technique. It may be noted here that, in the
following, our results have been compared with both 2D BEM results (MSGC) and
3D FEM results obtained using MAXWELL (MWD and microMEGAS).

The surface plot of electrostatic poten-
tial for a typical MSGC has been pre-
sented in Fig.1. Qualitatively, the com-
parison is found to be acceptable with
[7].
In order to carry out quantitative
comparison, we have computed electric
ﬁeld on the anode for MSGC-s as pre-
sented in Table I of [8] (cases (a) and
(b) corresponding to vacuum and di-
electric substrates, respectively). As in
[8], the computations have been done
for two thicknesses of the substrate,
namely, 100µm and 500µm. The elec-
tric ﬁelds on the anode turn out to
be 32.88kV/mm and 35.76kV/mm for a
vacuum substrate as the thickness is reduced from 500µm to 100µm which according
to [8] varied from 32.7kV/mm to 36.6kV/mm. Similarly, for a dielectric substrate,
the values according to the present computations are 32.8kV/mm and 37.85kV/mm
while those in [8] are 32.5kV/mm and 36.9kV/mm. It may be said that the trend of
the variation is well represented and the numerical values are reasonably close. The
small diﬀerences can be attributed to several reasons, the most important being the
fact that the present computations are 3D in nature, while those in [8] were 2D.

Here we have considered a typical MWD having the dimensions as in [3]. In the
following Figs.2(a) and 2(b), we have presented the contours of the electric ﬁeld on
the plane perpendicular to the anode axis and the electric ﬁeld variation along the
hole axis of a typical microwire detector. Once again, the comparison with [3] is
found to be satisfactory both qualitatively and quantitatively.

This part of the computation has been carried out in relatively more detail. We
have considered several microMEGAS having geometry as discussed in [9] for easy
comparison. In Figs.3(a) and 3(b), we have presented the computed electric ﬁeld
surface and contours and the change in the electric ﬁeld along the center of a mesh
hole. These results once again agree with those in [9] reasonably well.

3 Conclusion

Using the neBEM solver, it has been possible for us to estimate the three-dimensional
electric ﬁeld in several micro pattern gas detectors. The accuracy of the obtained
results have been conﬁrmed by comparing them with existing 2D BEM and 3D FEM
results. Despite having a large length scale variation (1:200) and the use of extremely
coarse discretization, the solver has yielded results that are precise and reliable using
little computational resource. Since detailed simulation of gas detectors begins with
the computation of electrostatic conﬁguration within the device, and depends very
critically on the accuracy of the estimated electric ﬁeld at any arbitrary point within
a given device, the neBEM solver is expected to become an important tool in carrying
out thorough analysis of gas detectors. This is more true for the new generation
detectors since the length scales of these detectors vary widely from component to
component.

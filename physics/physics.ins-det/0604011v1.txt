1. Introduction
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a joint ESA/NASA mission to detect and
observe gravitational waves. Its technology demonstrator LISA Pathﬁnder carries two payloads,
a European LISA technology Package (LTP) and a US-provided Disturbance Reduction System
(DRS) to test key technology needed for LISA. A core part of the LTP is the Optical Metrology
System (OMS) that monitors the position, the alignment and the ﬂuctuations of the test
masses ([1] to [8]).

Abstract. This paper presents a procedure to perform fully autonomous on orbit alignment
of the interferometer on board the LISA technology package (LTP). LTP comprises two free-
ﬂoating test masses as inertial sensors that additionally serve as end-mirrors of a set of
interferometers. From the output signals of the interferometers, a subset has been selected
to obtain alignment information of the test masses. Based on these signals, an alignment
procedure was developed and successfully tested on the engineering model of the optical bench.
Furthermore, operation procedures for the characterization of critical on orbit properties of the
optical metrology system (e. g. ﬁber noise) have been established.

The OMS includes four heterodyne interferometers on an optical bench (see Figure 1):

Position of the beam (here labelled as DC) with respect to the center of the QPD
Diﬀerential wavefront sensing (DWS) [2] that gives information on the misalignment of the
beams with respect to each other, and consequently of the test mass.

The signals selected for the alignment procedure are:

Total power Σ: is the sum of the averaged power measured by each quadrant. This is a non-
negative number, which is scaled such that a value of 1.0 (nominal value) indicates when
both the Measurement Beam (MB) and Reference Beam (RB) are switched on and well-
aligned. Experimental values from other runs or the best available prediction are used for
this scaling.

Horizontal DC alignment φDC: provides

the diﬀerence between the averaged power
measured by the left and right section of the QPD. It is normalized by the unscaled Σ,
such that the variation range is

1 . . . 1 (0 at the center of the QPD).

Vertical DC alignment ηDC: provides the diﬀerence between the averaged power measured
by the upper and lower section of the QPD. It is normalized by the unscaled Σ, such that
the variation range is

1 . . . 1 (0 at the center of the QPD).

−

Horizontal DWS alignment φDWS: gives the diﬀerence,
measured by the left and right section of the QPD.

−

in radian, between the phase

Vertical DWS alignment ηDWS: gives the diﬀerence, in radian, between the phase measured

by the upper and lower section of the QPD.

Contrast on the QPD c: provides the contrast measured over the whole surface of the QPD.

This is a number between 0 and 1 (also usual to be expressed as 0 %. . . 100 %).

Longitudinal phase ϕ: is the phase measured, in radians (

π . . . π), over the whole surface of
the QPD. A phase-tracking algorithm is applied to the data, in order to avoid 2π-hopping,
and be able to follow long-term drifts of the test-masses.

−

Raw data delivered by the phasemeter [3, 4] is used to generate these signals in the Data
Management Unit (DMU). These signals are labelled with a lower index ‘1’, ‘12’, ‘R’ or ‘F’ to
indicate from which interferometer they originate. For example, interferometer 1 produces the
signals Σ1, φDC

, c1 and ϕ1.

DC signals have a larger dynamic range and are not necessarily zero for optimal alignment,
as they are referred to the center of the QPD. DWS signals are zero for an optimal alignment,
which is to ﬁrst order independent of the diode position [5], and oﬀer better precision over a
shorter dynamic range.

3. Interferometer initial acquisition
The aim of this procedure is to autonomously align both test masses on board LTP, by using
the interferometric signals mentioned before, for initial alignment during commissioning and for
later re-alignment.

There are three diﬀerent acquisition steps to be sequentially executed according to the

alignment state (see Figure 2):

Scan: At this step, only the reference beam hits the QPD. The test mass is moved following a
spiral around the nominal incoming beam axes. This way, the reﬂected measurement beam
describes an spiral on the detection plane until a certain percentage of it is detected by the
QPD. If the process exceeds a certain pre-deﬁned time, a time-out ﬂag is set: the reference
beam is turned oﬀ and the scanning process repeated. After a second ”time-out” event, an
ERROR message signalizes a malfunction of the Optical Metrology System, allowing the
intervention from ground.

DC: The measurement beam hits the QPD, but no interference takes place. The test mass is
aligned using a control loop with the DC alignment signals as error signals. The target is
not to reach zero but a value pre-estimated in earlier runs or the best theoretical prediction.
DWS: Both beams interfere to a level such that a predeﬁned contrast threshold has been achieved.
The test mass is aligned using a control loop with the DWS alignment signals as error
signals. The target is to reach zero, as this means optimal overlap of the two interfering
beams. This alignment has a higher sensitivity in comparison to the DC alignment but a
smaller dynamic range.

Each interferometer is considered to be properly aligned if it delivers contrast values greater

than 50 % and the DWS signals reach zero.

3.1. Experimental implementation
The alignment procedure was tested on the Engineering Model of the LTP optical bench,
for which test mass 1 was substituted by a 3-axis PZT. Alignment signals were produced by
dedicated FPGA-based phasemeter [3, 4], similar to the ﬂight model. A laboratory PC performed
the phasementer back-end calculations (instead of the DMU onboard LTP) and produced the
feedback signals for the test mass (3-axis PZT in our case). Because of the limited dynamic
range of the used PZT, the criteria to switch between the acquisition modes had to be re-deﬁned
as follows: for a contrast value below 60 % the PZT performs a scan. The DC-servo is switched
on when the contrast reaches 60 % and the DWS-servo takes over from 75 % until the end of
the alignment. Implementation of the procedure with higher dynamic range PZTs is foreseen to
study the convergence of the procedure under more stringent start parameters.

Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the successful implementation of the autonomous alignment.

4. Diagnostic Procedures
Further interferometric diagnostic procedures to be performed with LTP will deliver essential
information about the on orbit environmental conditions for the LISA interferometry.

4.1. Environmental phase noise
The phase noise of single-mode ﬁbers on orbit is important for LISA, as they are essential
elements in the baseline architecture.

On ground, this phase noise is dominated by environmental inﬂuences (such as thermal,
seismic or pressure variations). On orbit, these ﬂuctuations should be much smaller, but no

These optical pathlength diﬀerence ﬂuctuations (OPD) [3, 6] appear as common mode noise
in the output phase of the four LTP interferometers (ϕR,ϕ1,ϕ12,ϕF ). Figure 6 shows the linear
spectral density (LSD) of ϕR for two diﬀerent laboratory conditions.

Note that this common mode environmental noise cancels out in the measurement of test

mass position ﬂuctuations, as this is given by the substraction between ϕR and ϕ1 or ϕ12,
respectively [1].

4.2. Thermal inﬂuences
Thermal stability is expected to be an issue in LPF and even more in LISA. Several precision
heaters and thermistors are foreseen in the LTP design for thermal analysis.
In particular,
the on-orbit thermo-optical properties of the optical windows that serve as interface between
interferometer bench and test masses (see Figure 8) are impossible to be accurately measured
or predicted on ground. Hence, a controlled temperature change will be applied to several parts
of the interferometer and the optical windows, while the resulting changes in pathlength and
alignment are being monitored. Figure 9 shows a ground test of such measurements performed
on unmounted prototypes of the window made of the same athermal glass as will be used in the
ﬂight model.

The measurement of the pathlength ﬂuctuations caused by temperature changes in the
athermal glass can be used to determine the environmental temperature stability required to
fullﬁll the aimed sensitivity of 10 pm/√Hz at 1 mHz.

4.3. Other procedures
Absolute pathlength measurement: The aim of this procedure is to obtain the diﬀerence
between the expected test mass position and the real one during LTP operation. The LTP
interferometer is designed so that when the test masses are in their nominal position, the
length of the two arms of the R, 1 and 12 interferometer are equal and their output is
insensitive to laser frequency noise [1]. Applying laser frequency ﬂuctuations (either noise
or modulations) and measuring their eﬀect in the interferometer output ϕ1 or ϕ12 allows
the determination of the pathlength diﬀerence between the two interferometer arms and
therefore the deviation of each test mass from its nominal position.

Laser amplitude and frequency noise: As an important input for LISA, the on orbit
behaviour of the laser can be characterized during LTP operation. The amplitude injected in
the optical bench will be monitored by means of the two photodiode labelled ”Amp.stab.”
in Figure 1. The frequency noise of the laser shows up in the output of the frequency
interferometer ϕF [1]. These signals will be used during conventional science runs to stabilize
both amplitude and frequency of the laser. To obtain the on orbit unstabilized properties
of the laser, a procedure has been deﬁned in which the laser is left free-running and the
mentioned signals are sent to ground.

Excess noise at picometer level [4],[6],[8]: A procedure has been deﬁned to characterize

this noise term.

5. Conclusions
As LTP enters its implementation phase, the on orbit operations of this experiment have to be
deﬁned. We have developed and tested several procedures emphasizing the alignment of the test
masses with respect to the optical bench and its fully autonomous implementation.

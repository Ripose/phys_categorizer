Introduction

The purpose of the RD8 program [1] is to develop radiation hard strip and pixel detectors from GaAs material
as part of the research and development projects initiated by CERN for the LHC. This paper outlines the latest
results with regard to the understanding of the operation of GaAs detectors, their radiation hardness, and the
present level of development of ATLAS design strip and pixel detectors. The pixel detectors have been tested
within the RD19 collaboration [1] using the latest LHC pixel readout chip.

2 Understanding GaAs Detectors

To fabricate a GaAs detector two choices have to be made, namely the substrate material and the contacts
used. Care must also be taken over surface preparation and passivation.

The GaAs used almost universally is semi-insulating undoped, SI-U, LEC industrial substrate material
supplied by various manufacturers. Material with a low carbon concentration and chromium- or iron-doped
material, supplied by SITP, Tomsk, have been proposed as alternatives for improved radiation hardness. Charge
carrier absorption lengths vary from 100µm to 1600µm for holes and 100µm to 500µm for electrons [2]. The low
carbon material has the largest values for electrons. The spread in these values, even from a single manufacturer,
is also considerable. For a 200µm thick detector it is desirable to have absorption lengths for both carriers in
excess of 200µm. The detector may be fabricated with either a p-i-n structure [3] by doping the substrate
material, or with a Schottky and an ohmic contact realized by metal deposition.

The leakage current of a typical LEC diode as a function of reverse bias is shown in ﬁgure 1. The value of
the plateau current, which is independent of diode thickness, is between 10 and 30nA mm−2 at 20oC. When a
voltage corresponding to approximately one volt per micron of substrate thickness, Vf d, is reached the leakage
current increases dramatically due to current injection through the ohmic contact. Also shown in the ﬁgure is
the current characteristic of a diode with an improved ohmic contact where the leakage current increases only
slowly above the bias Vf d. This reduced current at high voltages allows the detector to be operated up to
voltages approaching twice Vf d. The improved ohmic contact was realised by annealing a multi-layer titanium-
palladium-germanium metal contact. Alenia SpA have fabricated diodes with an ion-implanted ohmic contact
which allow a bias many times Vf d to be applied [4].

The surface quality and thus preparation of the wafer has proved important in obtaining high charge collec-
tion eﬃciencies (CCE). The CCE increases linearly with applied bias (shown in ﬁgure 2 for a typical detector)

until the bias Vf d is reached, where the eﬃciency for a 200µm detector is typically between 60% and 80%. At
higher biases the eﬃciency slowly increases towards 100%.

Although high resistivity GaAs would be expected to deplete at a few volts this is not found to be the case.
With an alpha particle source on the back, ohmic contact, for example, signals are only observed at bias voltages
greater than Vf d.

The electric ﬁeld distribution in the material consists of two regions: a high ﬁeld region with an approximately
constant value of 1 V/µm where charge collection is high and a low ﬁeld region where almost no collection occurs.
The penetration depth of the high ﬁeld region has been measured at 0.7 to 1.0 µm per volt, depending upon
material [5, 6, 7]. The ﬁeld distribution explains the increase in leakage current at Vf d, the linear dependence
of CCE on bias, and the observation of rear alpha signals only at biases in excess of Vf d.

3 ATLAS detectors

3.1 Strip Detectors

Last year GaAs microstrip detectors with parallel strip patterned Schottky contacts were tested at CERN
[2, 8, 9]. Diﬀerent strip pitch and metal contact width-to-pitch ratios were used to investigate the eﬀects of
charge sharing and possible signal loss between strips. These detectors met LHC performance speciﬁcations
with respect to signal to noise, resolution, and speed [10].

The ﬁrst wedge-shaped ATLAS prototype detectors from EEV and Alenia were tested at CERN in the H8
test beam this year. These have 65mm long Schottky fan-shaped strips with the pitch varying from 50µm at the
narrow end to 76µm. The detectors have integrated bias structures and silicon nitride decoupling capacitors.
The detectors were read out by either analogue (Felix [11]) or binary [12] electronics. One detector irradiated
to a ﬂuence of 7.7 1013 24GeV/c p/cm2 was tested at room temperature with Felix readout. Two parallel strip
detectors with integrated resistors and decoupling capacitors fabricated upon Tomsk substrates, one of which
irradiated to a ﬂuence of 3 1013 p/cm2, were also tested with Felix readout. Analysis of these data has just
begun.

3.2 Pixel Detectors

The work reported in this section has been performed by members of RD8 and RD19.

Figure 3: Detection eﬃciency of GaAs pixel detector AL-IOC-10 with an ion-implanted ohmic contact as a
function of Omega3 read-out chip comparator threshold value

GaAs pixel detectors have been developed which are compatible with the RD19 Omega3/LHC1 [13] read-out
electronics. The pixel detectors form an array of 16 x 128 elements each 50µm by 500µm in size. The latest
pixel detectors fabricated by Alenia with an ion-implanted ohmic back contact have been tested in a 120GeV/c
pion beam. The detectors were 200µm thick and biased to 500V. The detection eﬃciency dependence upon the
Omega3 comparator threshold for the two planes of GaAs pixels under test in an Omega2 silicon telescope is
shown in ﬁgure 3. The pixels performed as well as the silicon telescope and demonstrated 100% CCE. These
results are from on-line analysis but show that GaAs pixels work extremely well.

4 Radiation Hardness

In the GaAs forward tracker detector of the ATLAS experiment the ﬂuence is dominated by pions at an estimated
level of 1.2 1014 π/cm2 over the experiment‘s ten year lifetime [14]. The neutron ﬂuence is expected to be 3
to 10 times less that this, while that due to the other charged hadrons is small in comparison. The eﬀects of
particular radiation have therefore been investigated. Electrons and gamma rays have shown negligible eﬀects.
The increase in leakage current due to neutrons (n), protons (p), and pions (π) is small, typically at the 50%
level after 1014 particles/cm2, and the current exhibits a slow decrease with time at room temperature after
irradiation. The value of Vf d is typically half its pre-irradiation value after 3 1013 p/cm2 and remains unchanged
at higher ﬂuences.

The charge collection, however, falls with ﬂuence, with the hole signal component being more aﬀected. The
reduction of CCE with ﬂuence depends on the type and energy of the irradiating particle. For a 200µm thick
LEC detector the CCE falls to 20% after 4 1014 n/cm2 (5300 electrons) or 1.5 1014 p/cm2 or only 6 1013
pions/cm2 [15]. The diﬀerences have been explained in term of the diﬀerent non-ionising energy loss, NIEL, of
the particles in the detector material, as shown in ﬁgure 4 [16].

All LEC material, except for the low carbon material, appears to degrade to give a minimum ionising particle
signal of approximately 4500 electrons after a ﬂuence of 1.6 1014 p/cm2. The latter material may be slightly
more radiation hard due to the high initial values of the charge carrier mean free drift lengths and gives a signal
of 7000 electrons after the same ﬂuence [17].

Diodes fabricated on Tomsk material have shown better radiation hardness [18], with a reduction of 50% in
CCE after a ﬂuence of 1.1 1013 (1GeV/c) p/cm2 at a ﬂux of 5 1014 p/hour. A dependence of the degradation

Total NIEL (10**14 keV per gm)

24GeV/c protons for 200µm thick SI-U LEC GaAs detectors

of CCE on the rate of irradiation has been reported. With a ﬂux of only 5 1013 p/hour the 50% CCE reduction
occurs after a ﬂuence of 1.5 1014 p/cm2. Proton irradiations have been performed between -5oC and -10oC
on LEC material. Preliminary results suggest that the reduction in CCE is slightly worse than with room
temperature irradiations.

5 X-ray Detection

A thickness of 200µm of GaAs has more than an order of magnitude higher X-ray absorption eﬃciency with
respect to 300µm of silicon over the medically interesting energy range of 10 to 100keV. The detection properties
of GaAs and Ge are similar but GaAs detectors can be operated at or just below room temperature. The
increased absorption eﬃciency implies that a lower dose is required for imaging applications to produce an
image of similar quality to that from ﬁlm or silicon detectors. A 100µm thick GaAs pad detector with an
ion-implanted ohmic contact, biased at 500V, has been used to produce Am-241 X-ray spectra [19]. At 20oC
the energy resolution of 20% allowed lines down to 20keV to be distinguished. At -30oC the leakage current
reduction allowed lines as low as 8keV to be resolved, with a resolution of 4%.

Low pressure growth of VPE GaAs is being investigated as a possible source of aﬀordable, high quality
material for X-ray imaging. The ﬁrst samples have recently been supplied for evaluation by Epitronics Corp.
[20]. These are 80µm thick, with charge carrier concentration ∼ 2-3 1014 /cm3. The material was found to
deplete as expected from standard theory to a depth of 20µm for an applied bias of 100V. The CCE of simple
pad detectors fabricated with this material was 100% in the depleted region, allowing the Barium (32keV) K
X-ray line to be resolved. The limiting factor was again the leakage current noise which was very high due to
the rough surface of the VPE material. Careful mechanical and chemical polishing of the wafer can reduce the
leakage current and thus allow better resolution to be obtained.

GaAs pixel detectors bump-bonded to Omega3 read-out electronics have been used to image medical X-ray
phantoms with Am-241 and Cd-109 X-ray sources [21]. The results are encouraging, with high signal-to-noise
and signal-to-contrast ratios being obtained. The results were improved by the partial removal of Compton
interactions using the fast-OR trigger of the electronics. Auto-radiography applications have been investigated
by imaging beta particles from P-32 labelled human mammary cells. A low noise level of 10−4 cps mm−2 and
linearity for activities between 0.005nCi and 0.5nCi were obtained. Further improvements are possible in the
quality of both the VPE and LEC material and should allow better results to be obtained.

6 Conclusions

The extended knowledge of the mechanism of charge transport in GaAs has led to detectors with 100% CCE.
ATLAS prototype strip detectors have been fabricated and test-beam results are being analysed. The required
speciﬁcations for ATLAS pixel detectors have been met. While the reduction in CCE due to charged hadron
irradiation is severe in conventional LEC material, low carbon material or Tomsk technology may provide better
radiation resistance. The ﬂux dependence of CCE degradation has to be investigated further. X-ray detection
with bulk-grown and VPE GaAs is under investigation. At present, leakage current noise limits the obtainable
resolution for room temperature operation.

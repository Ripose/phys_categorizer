Abstract

A proximity focusing ring imaging Cherenkov detector using aerogel as the radia-
tor has been studied for an upgrade of the Belle detector at the KEK-B-factory.
We constructed a prototype Cherenkov counter using a 4
4 array of 64-channel
ﬂat-panel multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu H8500) with a large eﬀective area. The
aerogel samples were made with a new technique to obtain a higher transmission
length at a high refractive index (n = 1.05). Multi-channel PMTs are read-out with
analog memory chips. The detector was tested at the KEK-PS π2 beam line in
November, 2002. To evaluate systematically the performance of the detector, tests
were carried out with various aerogel samples using pion beams with momenta be-
tween 0.5 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c. The typical angular resolution was around 14 mrad,
and the average number of detected photoelectrons was around 6. We expect that
pions and kaons can be separated at a 4σ level at 4 GeV/c.

1 Introduction

Silica aerogel is a unique material with a refractive index (n) in the range
between gases and liquids or solids. Its refractive index can be easily con-
trolled from n = 1.01 to 1.06. As a result, the refractive index of the aerogel
can be chosen such that for a given momentum interval in the few GeV/c
region charged pions radiate Cherenkov photons, while kaons stay below the
Cherenkov radiation threshold [1]. In the Belle experiment at KEK [2], a
threshold type Cherenkov detector (Belle-ACC) [3] which uses aerogel as a
radiator, is operated, providing at 3.5 GeV/c a kaon identiﬁcation eﬃciency
of 88% with a pion missidentiﬁcation probability of 8% [4].

A new production method of hydrophobic aerogel with a high transmission
length and n in the interval between 1.01 and 1.03 was developed during the
construction period of Belle-ACC [5]. The improvement in quality allows the
use of an aerogel radiator in a ring imaging Cherenkov counter (RICH) [6].
In the HERMES experiment at DESY, a RICH counter is used with a dual-
radiator (aerogel and gas), and mirrors to focus the Cherenkov photons [7]. A
similar detector is also designed for the LHCb experiment at CERN [8].

→

We are studying the feasibility of a RICH counter with an aerogel radiator
for the Belle-ACC in the forward end-cap region [9]. Since this part is now
optimized for the pion/kaon separation needed for tagging of the B ﬂavor, and
covering the momentum range below 2 GeV/c, separation at high-momentum
region of around 4 GeV/c is not adequate. This kinematic region is, however,
very important for the studies of two-body decays such as B
ππ, Kπ.
In order to achieve a π/K separation for a wider momentum range, a ring
imaging-type of detector is needed. Due to spatial restrictions, such a counter
has to be of the proximity focusing type. To cover the identiﬁcation in the
lower momentum region (around 0.7 GeV/c) as well as in the region up to
4 GeV/c, the aerogel has to have a refractive index around n = 1.05. The
ﬁrst beam test of such a detector was carried out in 2001 at the KEK-PS π2
beam line [10]. These tests used an array of multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu
R5900-M16) for photo-detection. The detected number of photoelectrons was
2.7 per ring for a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with n = 1.05, and the Cherenkov
angle resolution per photon was 10 mrad. These results were consistent with
expectations. The number of detected photons was, however, rather low, partly
because only 36% of the detector surface was covered by the photo-cathodes,
and partly because the transmission length of the aerogel with n = 1.05 could
not be made large enough. For the second beam test, we improved the aero-
gel transmission by optimizing the materials used in the production process.
The active area fraction of the photon detector was increased by employing
recently developed ﬂat-panel PMTs, Hamamatsu H8500. Although this type
of PMT is not immune to magnetic ﬁeld, and therefore cannot be applied in

2

the Belle spectrometer, we consider this device as an intermediate step in our
development. The paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst present the experi-
mental set-up with ﬂat-panel PMTs, brieﬂy review the improvement in aerogel
production, describe the measurements, and ﬁnally discuss the results.

The photon detector for the tested prototype RICH counter employed 64 chan-
nel multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu H8500, so called ﬂat-panel PMT) because

each PMT, an analog memory board is attached to read out multi-channel
PMT signals, as described below. Among 16 PMTs, 8 PMTs were delivered
in January, 2002, and the remaining PMTs were delivered in October, 2002.
Since the manufacture method of the PMT was still under development, they
exhibit a large variation in quantum eﬃciency and gain. The quantum eﬃ-

2.2 Aerogel radiator

The hydrophobic aerogel with a low refractive index (n = 1.01
developed for the Belle-ACC, is characterized by a high transmission length (
∼
40 mm at a wave length of 400 nm) which was not achieved before. However,
the transmission length of aerogel with a higher refractive index of n = 1.05
fell below one half the value compared to the aerogel with n = 1.03. Keeping
in mind that for a collider experiment a hydrophobic aerogel is preferred to
a hydrophilic one, we reexamined the aerogel production technique in a joint
development with Matsushita Electric Works Ltd.

1.03), as

∼

As a result, we found that the important factors determining the transmis-
sion length are the solvent and selection of the precursor to be used for its
production. Originally, we used methyl-alcohol for the solvent, and methyl-
silicate as a precursor [5]. When we applied di-methyl-formamide (DMF) [12],

3

and changed the supplier of the precursor, we could improve the transmission
length of the aerogel.

Figure 2 shows the refractive indices of aerogel and the relation to transmis-
sion length for samples which were used in this beam test. The refractive index
was determined by measuring the deﬂection angle of laser light (laser diode:
405 nm) at a corner of each aerogel tile; the transmission length was measured
with a photo-spectrometer (Hitachi U-3210). In addition to the samples pro-
duced with the new technique at Matsushita Electric Works Ltd. and Chiba
university, samples from BINP (Novosibirsk) were tested [13]; for comparison,
we also tested the samples used in the previous beam test. The thicknesses of
the prepared aerogel samples ranged from 10 mm to 25 mm. Various thick-
ness of up to about 50 mm were tested by stacking these samples. Note that
in the production of the aerogel samples at BINP propenol was used as the
solvent, and the resulting aerogel was hydrophilic. Also note that the Mat-
sushita aerogel samples produced with the new technique have a very similar
transmission length as the BINP samples. The transmission length for n
1.05
samples used in the ﬁrst beam test was around 15 mm, but was increased to
45 mm for Matsushita’s sample with the new production method.

2.3 Beam set-up

For the beam test, pions with momenta between 0.5 GeV/c and 4 GeV/c were
used. Beside the RICH detector under study, counters for triggering, tracking
and particle identiﬁcation were employed.

The set up of the aerogel RICH is shown in Figure 3. Two RICH counters
were placed in a light-shield box and tested simultaneously. Each RICH was
composed of a layer of aerogel radiator and a photo-detection plane, parallel
to the radiator face at a distance of 20 cm. The upstream Cherenkov counter
was the detector under study; the downstream counter was the one employed
in the previous beam test. Since the latter uses a well-known photo-detector,
multi-anode PMTs Hamamatsu R5900, we regarded it as a reference.

Particle identiﬁcation was done to remove particles other than pions. Two
CO2 gas Cherenkov counters in the beam line were used to exclude electrons.
Also, an aerogel counter was equipped and used to exclude protons for the
high-momentum region. This detector was also used to exclude muons for the
low-momentum region around 0.5 GeV/c.

The particle trajectories were measured with multi-wire proportional cham-
bers (MWPC) at the upstream and downstream ends of the light-shield box.

wires at 2 mm pitch and with 90% Ar + 10% CH4 gas ﬂow, were read out by

delay lines on the x and y cathode strips.

The trigger signal was generated as a coincidence of signals from several 5
×
5 cm2 plastic scintillation counters and anode signals from the MWPCs to
ensure valid tracking information.

2.4 Readout electronics

For the beam test, a new read-out system was designed by using analog mem-
ory chips. The analog memory chip is based on a chip developed by H. Ikeda
[14] for a cosmic-ray experiment. We borrowed the chips from NASDA (Na-
tional Space Development Agency of Japan), and developed the chip control
system. In the analog memory chip, the signals of 32 channels are preampliﬁed,
sampled in 1 µs intervals, and stored in an 8 steps deep analog pipeline. Figure
4 shows a schematic view of the readout system with these analog memories.
Two 32 channel analog memories are attached to each 64 channel PMT. The
memories corresponding to four PMTs are controlled by a 256 channel mem-
ory controller. When the gate pulse is formed from the trigger signal, a control
signal is sent from the controller to the analog memories. The diﬀerence in the
value of the analog memory between the latest and the ﬁrst memory content
is fed to the output. The obtained output values of 256 channels are clocked
into one signal train with a period of 10 µs per channel. Each analog memory
controller outputs the serial signal together with synchronized control signals.
These signals are then read by a 12-bit VME ADC (DSP8112, MTT Co.) with
a conversion time of 5 µs.

2.5 Reference RICH

A reference RICH was instrumented with multi-anode PMTs, Hamamatsu
R5900-M16, the same photon detector as used in the previous test [10]. The
quantum eﬃciency of the PMTs is around 26% (at 400 nm), and the gain
was around 6
900 V applied to the photo-cathode. The PMTs
6 array at a 30 mm pitch. Due to a limited number of
were grouped in a 2
available PMTs and read-out channels, only a part of the Cherenkov ring was
covered with photon detectors.

3 Measurement and results

Most of the test measurements were performed with a π− beam at 3 GeV/c. To
systematically evaluate the detector performance, data were taken with diﬀer-

5

ent aerogel samples with various transmission lengths and thicknesses. Data
were also taken by varying the π− momentum in the range from 0.5 GeV/c
to 4.0 GeV/c.

A few typical events are displayed in Figure 5. The hits on PMTs can be
associated with the expected position of the Cherenkov ring. The hit near
the center of the ring is due to Cherenkov radiation generated by the beam
particle in the PMT window. The distribution of accumulated hits is shown in
Figure 6. Cherenkov photons from the aerogel radiator are clearly seen with a
low background level. The background hit distribution on the photon detector
is consistent with the assumption that it originates from Cherenkov photons
which were Rayleigh scattered in the radiator.

The pulse-height distribution of the Cherenkov photons detected in one of the
ﬂat-panel PMT is shown in Figure 7. The raw data were corrected as follows.
A common-mode ﬂuctuation of the base line was subtracted and signals due to
cross-talk in the read-out electronics were removed. We also applied a thresh-
old cut to suppress the pedestal noise contribution. In Figure 7, the signal
mainly containing one photoelectron is clearly separated from the pedestal
peak. Note, however, that this distribution diﬀers considerably from tube to
tube because of the large variation in performance, as described before.

3.1 Cherenkov-angle resolution for single photons

Figure 8(a) shows a typical distribution of the Cherenkov-angle for single pho-
tons. The angular resolution was obtained from a ﬁt of this distribution with
a Gaussian signal and a linear function for the background. Figure 9 shows
the resolution in the Cherenkov angle for the π− beam at 3 GeV/c and 20 mm
thick aerogel samples. The resolution was around 14 mrad, independent of the
refractive index. The main contributions to the resolution of the Cherenkov an-
gle come from the uncertainty in the emission point and from the pixel size of
the PMT. The ﬁrst contribution is estimated to be σemp = d sin θc cos θc/L√12,
where d is the aerogel thickness, θc is the Cherenkov angle and L is the distance
from an average emission point in the aerogel to the surface of the PMT. The
second contribution is σpix = a cos2 θc/L√12, where a is the pixel size. The
measured variation of the resolution with the thickness of aerogel is shown in
Figure 10 together with the expectations. By comparing the measured reso-
lution and the expected values, we observed a rather good agreement. There
was, however, a discrepancy between the two, which can be accounted for by
a contribution of about 6 mrad. The discrepancy could arise from the eﬀect of
aerogel (non-ﬂat aerogel surface and possible non-uniformities in the refractive
index due to position variation and chromatic dispersion), which are subject to
further investigation. The uncertainty in the track direction is expected to be

6

negligible at 3 GeV/c, but increases considerably at low momenta (0.5 GeV/c)
due to the eﬀect of multiple-scattering, as can be seen in Figure 11.

Figure 8(b) shows a typical distribution of the number of hits within
the average Cherenkov angle. The number of hits for the signal region was es-
timated by subtracting the background from the ﬁts to the Cherenkov-angle
distribution. The number of detected photons (Npe) depends on the aerogel
thickness and the eﬀect of scattering. It is expressed as
Npe = C
−
where Λ is the transmission length of the aerogel at an average wave length
of 400 nm and ǫ(λ) is quantum eﬃciency of the PMT. Figure 12 shows the
dependence of the number of detected photons on the aerogel thickness. As
expected from the above expression, the number of photons does not linearly
increase with the aerogel thickness, but saturates due to the scattering eﬀect
in aerogel. Figure 13 shows the dependence of the number of photons with
transmission length. From the ﬁgure the beneﬁt of the improvement in the
transmission length of the n = 1.05 aerogel from around 15 mm, as used in
the previous beam test, to 45 mm using the new production technique be-
comes evident. The dependence on the pion momentum, displayed in Figure
14, is ﬁtted with the form expected from the Cherenkov relations, and shows
a good agreement. For pions with momenta above 1 GeV/c, the number of
detected Cherenkov photons was typically around 6 for aerogel samples with
n = 1.05.

−

The performance of the RICH counter under study was compared in the same
set-up with the performance of the reference counter with a well-known photon
detector, Hamamatsu R5900-M16 multi-anode PMTs. Since the two counters
have a diﬀerent active area fraction (84% for the ﬂat-panel PMTs, and 36%
for the R5900-M16 PMTs) and a diﬀerent acceptance, the comparison of the
photon yields was made by normalizing to the full active surface. While the
ﬂat-panel yield for a particular case was 6.2, which resulted in 7.8 if extrapo-
lated to the full active area, the corresponding number for the R5900-M16 was
12. It appears that this diﬀerence is mainly due to the rather low quantum
eﬃciency and ampliﬁcation of some of the ﬂat-panel tubes employed. This, in
turn, causes ineﬃciencies in single photon detection with a given threshold. If
the best tube in the set is normalized to the full acceptance, the corresponding
number increases to 10, and we would expect about 8 photons per ring.

3.3 Particle Identiﬁcation

∼

∼

Finally, we estimate the performance of pion/kaon separation in the momen-
tum range of around 4 GeV/c, which is of considerable importance for the Belle
experiment. If we take into account a typical measured value for the single-
photon angular resolution, σc
14 mrad, and the number of detected photons
6, typical for 20 mm thick aerogel samples with n = 1.05, we can es-
Npe
timate the Cherenkov angle resolution per track to be σc/qNpe = 5.7 mrad.
This naive estimate is also conﬁrmed by the direct measurement shown in
Figure 15. Here, the track-by-track Cherenkov angle is calculated by taking
the average of the angles measured for hits around the predicted position of
the Cherenkov ring. From this we can deduce that at 4 GeV/c, where the
diﬀerence of Cherenkov angles for pions and kaons is 23 mrad, a 4σ separa-
tion between the two is possible. As an additional cross check, we have also
collected data with the pion beam of 1.1 GeV/c, which can be used to rep-
resent a kaon beam of 4 GeV/c (apart from a slightly larger sigma due to
multiple scattering). As can be seen from Figure 15, the two peaks are well
separated. Thus, the proximity focusing aerogel RICH seems to be promising
for the upgrade of the Belle PID system at the forward region.

4 Conclusions

We report on the test beam results of a proximity focusing RICH using aero-
gel as the radiator. To obtain larger photoelectron yields, we used ﬂat-panel
multi-anode PMT with a large eﬀective area, and aerogel samples produced
with a recently developed method which have a higher transmission length
than before. We also developed a multi-channel PMT read-out system using
analog memory chips. A clear Cherenkov ring from the aerogel radiator could
be observed, and the number of photons was enhanced compared to that in
previous tests. We performed a systematic study of the detector using various
samples of the aerogel. The typical angular resolution was around 14 mrad
and the number of detected photoelectrons was around 6. The pion/kaon sep-
aration at 4 GeV/c is expected to be around 4σ.

However, we still have some issues which have to be solved for implementation
in the Belle spectrometer. The most important item is the development of a
PMT which can be operated under a strong magnetic ﬁeld (1.5T). An example
of a candidate for such a device is a multi-anode hybrid photodiode (HPD)
or hybrid avalanche photodiode (HAPD). Of course, for a good candidate,
its ability to eﬃciently detect single photons on a large active area has to be
demonstrated. The other item is mass production of the aerogel tiles. While
we have demonstrated that the new production method signiﬁcantly increases

8

the transmission length of the n = 1.05 aerogel, the production method has to
be adapted to stable good-quality manufacturing. We will study these items
at the next stage towards construction of a real detector.

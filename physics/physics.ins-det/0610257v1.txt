There has been an increasing interest in the monitoring of nuclear fuel for power reactors by
detecting the anti-neutrinos produced during operation. Small liquid scintillator detectors have
already demonstrated sensitivity to operational power levels, but more sensitive monitoring requires
improvements in the eﬃciency and uniformity of these detectors. In this work, we use a montecarlo
simulation to investigate the detector performance of four diﬀerent detector conﬁgurations. Based
on the analysis of neutron detection eﬃciency and positron energy response, we ﬁnd that the optimal
detector design will depend on the goals and restrictions of the speciﬁc installation or application.
We have attempted to present the relevant information so that future detector development can
proceed in a proﬁtable direction.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, there has been an increasing inter-
est in the monitoring and safeguarding of nuclear
power reactors. Over the last few years, a group
from Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories
has been demonstrating the feasibility of a small
simple detector to monitor the anti-neutrino pro-
duction during the operation of a nuclear power
reactor located in San Onofre, California[1]. By
using the anti-neutrinos which are produced by the
uranium and plutonium fuel itself during the ﬁs-
sion process, the reactor fuel can be continuously
monitored in a non-invasive way. The ability to
monitor the nuclear fuel composition in real-time
has advantages for both limiting the proliferation
of nuclear material as well as increasing the oper-
ational eﬃciency of power generation[2, 3].

The current experience at San Onofre has
demonstrated that a small neutrino detector lo-
cated within 25 m of the reactor core is easily sen-
sitive to the power level at which the nuclear re-
actor is being operated. However, more sensitive
tests to determine the fuel burn-up and fuel com-
position, while showing promising results, have
shown the limitations of the detector design.

This work is an attempt to evaluate several pos-
sible directions for improved compact neutrino de-
tector designs using the latest simulations avail-
able to the reactor neutrino community. The de-

tectors are based on the conventional technology of
liquid scintillator and photomultiplier tubes. The
anti-neutrino event signature is the inverse beta-
decay process: ¯νe + p → e+ + n. This yields
a coincident event signature,
from the prompt
positron annihilation and the delayed neutron cap-
ture, which is relatively free from background con-
tamination. The use of a liquid scintillator that
is doped with gadolinium improves the signal to
background further by reducing the neutron cap-
ture time and increasing the energy which that
capture releases.

The simulations were based on the open-source

(GLG4sim)[4, 5] which have been extensively used
in the KamLAND experiment[6]. In addition, we
have made use of several of the improvements that
have been developed within the Double Chooz
collaboration[7].
Speciﬁcally, the development
of high quality Gd doped liquid scintillator has
been carefully studied and implemented within
the simulation, as well as detailed improvements
in material properties and PMT performance.

For this study, it was considered that there are
two major features of the detector response which
will be important for reactor monitoring. The
ﬁrst concerns the eﬃciency for detecting events
in which the neutron is captured on Gd within
the ﬁducial volume of the detector. The overall
acceptance for anti-neutrino events is a product
of positron and neutron identiﬁcations. However,
the positron detection eﬃciency is largely a func-
tion of the environmental conditions and can more
directly be improved by shielding the detector to

trino oscillation measurement at Double Chooz.
The detector uses nested acrylic cylinders to con-
tain the target and gamma-catcher volumes. The
2 m3 target has a height of 1.5 m and diame-
ter 1.3 m while the gamma-catcher has a uniform
thickness of 35 cm. The 1 m thick mineral oil
buﬀer completely surrounds the active scintillator
regions and is contained within a stainless steel
vessel. The stainless steel is considered to be pol-
ished with a reﬂectivity of ∼40%. A total of 282
PMTs are installed on the inner wall of the stain-
less steel vessel for an active coverage of ∼15%.

The total dimension of this detector design is
4.2 m in height and 4 m in diameter. While this is
a little larger than the stated goal, it is expected
that this design will provide the optimal detector
performance and is therefore a useful benchmark
against which the other detector designs can be
compared.

allow a reduction in the minimum energy thresh-
old for acceptance. The neutron eﬃciency, on the
other hand, can be improved through design fea-
tures of the detector—ensuring that the photons
released through the n-Gd capture are all detected
within the scintillator to allow good separation be-
tween neutron-like and positron-like energy depo-
sitions.

The second detector performance characteristic
studied was the uniformity of energy response for
positron events.
If suﬃcient statistical power is
available, the positron energy spectrum—which is
directly related to the parent neutrino spectrum—
will contain all needed information to extract the
speciﬁc fuel compositions in real-time. This, how-
ever, requires that the detector itself does not con-
tribute any meaningful distortion to the energy
spectrum, whether it be a non-linear response or
a non-uniformity based on position dependence.

II. DETECTOR DESIGNS

The detector designs that were studied were in-
tended to explore various methods of reducing the
overall size of a detector while maintaining suﬃ-
cient statistical acceptance to be relevant for the
desired monitoring. The baseline ﬁducial volume
of 2 m3 (∼2 tons) was chosen for all designs to pro-
vide a suﬃcient event rate for any detector within
∼60 m of a reactor core. In addition, an attempt
was made to keep the overall size of the detector
small—all dimensions less than 3–4 m.

The four designs, described in detail below,
make use of the latest technological developments
which have been implemented within the reactor
neutrino community. All of the designs include a
ﬁducial “target” region which is ﬁlled with a Gd
doped liquid scintillator. Some of the designs in-
clude a “gamma-catcher” which is an un-doped
liquid scintillator region surrounding the target
whose purpose is to completely absorb the pho-
tons released by the n-Gd capture. Acrylic is
used wherever a volume boundary requires optical
transparency. Also, in all designs, 8” PMTs have
been used and are installed within a 1 m mineral
oil buﬀer whose purpose is to reduce the singles
background by attenuating the radioactive pho-
tons emitted by the 40K in the PMT glass.

Design 1: Miniature Physics Design

This design is a scaled down version, based on
the state-of-the-art detectors that have been devel-
oped for the next generation reactor based neu-

3

Tyvek (90% reﬂectivity) and the top and bottom
of the outer vessel are non-reﬂective. A total of
30 PMTs (15 each at the top and bottom) pro-
vide ∼15% coverage. The total dimension of this
detector is 3.5 m in height and 2.0 m in diameter.

Design 4: Single Sided Design

This design attempts to reduce the overall foot-
print and cost of the previous design by using re-
ﬂective walls to eliminate most of the PMT cover-
age and the associated mineral oil volume. Iden-
tical to Design 1, this design has a 2 m3 target
cylinder of 1.5 m height and 1.3 m diameter and a
uniform 35 cm gamma-catcher. However, in this
design, PMTs are only located at the top and bot-
tom of the detector. Therefore, the outer vessel
matches the diameter of the gamma-catcher, but
extends an extra meter at the top and bottom to
house the mineral oil buﬀer and the PMTs. The
barrel region of the outer vessel is deﬁned to have a
diﬀuse reﬂective surface—approximating Tyvek—
with reﬂectivity of ∼90%, while the top and bot-
tom are deﬁned to be non-reﬂective. A total of 30
PMTs (15 each at the top and bottom) provide
an eﬀective covering of ∼15%. The overall dimen-
sion of this detector is 4.2 m in height and 2 m in
diameter.

Design 3: Two Sided Minimal Design

This detector is an alternate attempt to reduce
the footprint of the detector, while maintaining
the use of a gamma-catcher. In this design, PMTs
are only used at the top of the detector. The tar-
get region has the same 2 m3 volume as Designs
1 and 2—1.5 m height and 1.3 m diameter. In or-
der to improve light collection at the single end,
the gamma-catcher is now a conic section with a
base diameter of 2 m, a height of 2.2 m, and a top
diameter of 2.50 m. This provides a thickness of
35 cm or greater around the target region. With a
diﬀuse reﬂective surface similar to Tyvek (reﬂec-
tivity ∼90%) the chosen 6.5◦ angle of the outer
vessel ensures that light from anywhere in the tar-
get volume will have a path length of less than
14 m to the plane of the PMTs. While the bot-
tom of the detector is now also reﬂective, the top
is still deﬁned to be non-reﬂective. A total of 24
PMTs are installed at the top of the 1 m mineral
oil buﬀer providing ∼15% active converage. This
design has a total dimension of 3.2 m in height
and 2.5 m in diameter.

III. NEUTRON IDENTIFICATION
EFFICIENCY

The identiﬁcation of an inverse beta-decay event
is largely dependent on the ability to identify the
signature of the neutron capture by gadolinium.

In an attempt to reduce further the footprint of
Design 2, this detector has eliminated the gamma-
catcher entirely. To compensate for the expected
eﬃciency loss at the edge of the target, the target
volume has been expanded to match the diameter
of the gamma-catcher in Designs 1 and 2. Thus
the target has dimensions of 1.5 m height and 2 m
in diameter for a total volume of 4.71 m3—more
than double the previous values. This provides a
good test of the relative beneﬁt of increased eﬃ-
increased ﬁducial volume. Similar to
ciency vs.
Design 2, a 1 m mineral oil buﬀer and PMTs are
placed at the top and bottom of the detector. As
in Design 2, the barrel region of the outer ves-
sel has a diﬀuse reﬂective surface consistent with

The n-Gd capture process releases between 3–10
photons with a total energy of ∼8 MeV. Since the
positron energy deposition is usually between 1–
6 MeV, it is common to deﬁne a neutron capture
signature as any energy deposition of 6–10 MeV.
In addition to ineﬃciencies which are caused by
losses of some of the photons from the n-Gd cap-
ture, there will also be some neutrons which will
instead be captured on free protons in the scin-
tillator. This n-proton capture releases a single
photon of energy 2.2 MeV and would not satisfy
the selection criteria.

For this study, we generated a uniform dis-
tribution of neutrons within the target volume.
The neutrons were generated with a kinetic en-
ergy of 2.5 MeV in a random direction. This ki-
netic energy is higher than that expected from
inverse beta-decay events, but subsequent cross-
checks demonstrated that the results presented
here are consistent with those of lower energy neu-
trons. The simulation libraries described above
were used to montecarlo the neutron thermaliza-
tion and eventual capture. The ensuing optical
photons from the scintillator were tracked to the
photocathodes of the PMTs. Within the simula-
tion, the PMTs used a radially dependent quan-
tum eﬃciency which is consistent with experimen-
tal testing. This yielded a photon hit-count per
PMT that is roughly equivalent to a number of
photoelectrons. This photon hit-count has been
used for all comparisons of detector response—
avoiding the complications of varying electronics
and data acquisition systems.

By using the truth information from the monte-
carlo simulation, events were selected in which the
neutron was stopped or captured within the tar-
get volume. All PMT hits recorded within 100ns
were summed together to create an eﬀective to-
tal charge deposition. Fig. 1 shows the photon hit
spectrum for these events from Design 1. One can
quite clearly see the n-Gd capture peak at around
3200 photon hits (representing ∼8 MeV) and the
n-p capture peak at around 900 photon hits (rep-
resenting 2.2 MeV).

To avoid uncertainties in the quality of cali-
brations or the variations in the linearity of re-
sponse for the various detector designs, it was de-
cided that the minimum threshold for n-Gd cap-
ture identiﬁcation would be deﬁned as the number
of photon hits located at the point 2
3 between the
ﬁtted peak values of the n-Gd and n-p captures.
This value would be roughly equivalent to ∼6 MeV
and provided a very robust and uniform deﬁnition
to be applied to all four designs.
In Fig. 2 the
photon hit spectrum for each of the four detec-
tor designs is shown with the applicable threshold

value superimposed.

With the application of these thresholds, the
overall neutron detection eﬃciency for each design
is shown in Table I. It was an initial surprise that
Design 1 had such a low eﬃciency. After further
investigation, it was understood that the small di-
mension of the target and gamma-catcher allow
many of the photons from the n-Gd capture to
penetrate to the inactive mineral oil buﬀer before
depositing their energy. In the other three designs,
these photons are being absorbed in the outer wall
of the vessel and some of that energy is re-emitted
back into the active scintillator volumes. This
quite clearly demonstrates that while Design 1 is
optimized for larger detectors with ﬁducial volume
of greater than 10 m3, it is not necessarily optimal
for a more compact design.

tures for each detector design. The sample is based on
events in which a neutron stopped within the target

was captured on gadolinium. The threshold was chosen as the point 2
3 between the ﬁtted peak values of the
n-Gd and n-p captures.

Uniformity of Neutron Identiﬁcation

To better understand the speciﬁc characteristics
of each design, we investigated the dependence of
the neutron capture identiﬁcation eﬃciency on po-
sition within the target volume. The truth infor-
mation from the montecarlo simulation was used
to identify the vertex position of the neutron cap-
ture. The events were binned in the vertical (z-
position) and radial distances from the center of
the target volume. Using the same threshold de-
scribed above for the deﬁnition of an accepted neu-

tron capture event, the eﬃciencies, as a function
of both z-position and radius, are plotted for all
detector designs in Fig. 3.

As expected, one can quite clearly see that, de-
spite the low overall eﬃciency, Design 1 shows the
most uniform response. In a similar fashion, De-
sign 3, with the lack of any gamma-catcher, shows
signiﬁcant degradation in the eﬃciency as it nears
the boundaries of the target volume. Perhaps
more interesting is to compare the radial perfor-
mance of Design 2 and Design 3. Their eﬃciencies
are relatively similar out to the nominal radius of

just over 600 mm. However, in the additional tar-
get volume of Design 3 (radius > 650 mm) the ef-
ﬁciency drops oﬀ quit radically. Perhaps the most
surprising observation is the relatively good per-
formance of Design 4. Its z-position dependence is
not as good as Designs 1 or 2, but for most of the
range, its eﬃciency for accepting neutron capture
events is signiﬁcantly higher— 10% higher than

only in the bottom 25–30 cm that the eﬃciency
of Design 4 drops oﬀ to values equal to those of
Design 2. Radially, Design 4 appears to maintain
better uniformity than all other designs with the
exception of Design 1, only showing a declining
eﬃciency for the last 10 cm.

Of course, most of the volume of the target
cylinder is at the larger radii where the eﬃciencies
are dropping oﬀ. In fact, the eﬃciencies shown in
Table I are under-weighted at large radii due to
the loss of 2–3% of the generated neutrons which
have leaked out of the ﬁducial volume. In a real
detector, these events would be compensated by
an almost equal number of events, occurring out-
side of the ﬁducial volume, for which neutrons
would be captured within the target region. To
better evaluate the total eﬀective volume of each
of these designs, we assumed a uniform distribu-
tion of neutron captures and integrated the dif-
ferential eﬃciencies over the total volume of each
design’s target region with the following results:
Design 1 = 0.93 m3; Design 2 = 1.42 m3; De-
sign 3 = 2.15 m3; Design 4 = 1.51 m3. Recall that
the nominal target volume was 2 m3 and that De-
sign 3 actually had a volume of 4.72 m3.

IV. POSITRON ENERGY RESPONSE

The positrons from a reactor induced inverse
beta-decay event will deposit between 1–6 MeV of
energy into the scintillator with a maximum like-
lihood value of ∼2.5 MeV. We performed some
simple studies of the linearity of the energy re-
sponse to positrons with kinetic energies between
0–5 MeV and did not see any signiﬁcant energy de-
pendence. We therefore concentrated on two spe-
ciﬁc positron samples—one with kinetic energy of
1.5 MeV corresponding to the peak energy deposi-
tion and one with kinetic energy of 3.5 MeV which
would be in the high energy tail—which we used
to study in detail the position dependence of the
diﬀerent detector designs.

Each positron sample was generated uniformly
within the target volumes of each detector design.
The simulation libraries described above were used
to montecarlo the ionization losses and the even-

7

tual positron annihilation. The ensuing optical
photons from the scintillator were tracked to the
photocathodes of the PMTs. Within the simula-
tion, the PMTs used a radially dependent quan-
tum eﬃciency which is consistent with experimen-
tal testing. This yielded a photon hit-count per
PMT that is roughly equivalent to a number of
photoelectrons. This photon hit-count has been
used for all comparisons of detector response—
avoiding the complications of varying electron-
ics and data acquisition systems. All PMT hits
recorded within 100ns were summed together to
create an eﬀective total charge deposition. An ex-
ample of the total energy deposition from these
two samples in Design 1 is shown in Fig. 4.

generated within the target volume of detector De-
sign 1. The photon hits represent the simulated num-
ber of photoelectrons at the PMTs. The positrons
were generated with kinetic energies of 1.5 and
3.5 MeV.

The truth information from the montecarlo sim-
ulation was used to identify the vertex position of
the positron event. The events were binned in the
vertical (z-position) or radial distances from the
center of the target volume. The recorded photon
hit-counts were ﬁtted to a Gaussian for each bin
in either radial distance or z-position. These data,
for all detector designs, are shown in Fig. 5 as a
percent diﬀerence from the mean response of the
detector. The errors shown represent the Gaussian
sigma of the ﬁt.

The ﬁrst thing to notice when looking at these
distributions is that the responses to the 1.5 MeV
and 3.5 MeV positrons is quite nearly identical.
Also, the errors are consistent with the expected
energy resolution from the liquid scintillator. As
with the neutron capture eﬃciencies, Design 1
shows the most uniform response of all detec-
tor designs.
It was a bit surprising to see the
large variations in the radial responses for De-
it
signs 2–4. After some further investigation,

FIG. 5: Relative positron energy response as a function of position within the target volume for each detector
design, as labeled. The truth information from the montecarlo was used to identify the Z positions (left) and the
radial positions (right) for each positron event. The responses of positrons with kinetic energy of 1.5 and 3.5 MeV
are shown simultaneously as a percent diﬀerence from the mean response of the detector. Errors represent the
ﬁtted Gaussian sigma of the data in each bin.

was understood that this structure is consistent
with the ring-like implementation of the PMTs at
the top and bottom of the detectors. The addi-
tional PMTs on the barrel of Design 1 are clearly
serving to reduce these variations. Also, as was
expected, the detector designs which incorporate
two-sided readouts (Designs 2–3) show more uni-
form response relative to z-position than is seen
in Design 4. However, given that the radial re-
sponses of these detector designs show such large
variations, it is not clear that the z-position unifor-
mity provides a signiﬁcant gain. In fact, it appears
that Design 4, with a slightly larger surface area of
PMTs at the single end, provides a more uniform
response with respect to radial position than De-
sign 2— ±12% compared to ±15%. In addition,
this appears well matched to the z-dependent re-
sponse of Design 4 which is relatively similar.

Simple Energy Calibration

An attempt was made to see if the variations in
detector response could be reduced by implement-
ing a simple energy calibration as a function of
vertex position. Clearly Design 1, while providing
suﬃcient PMTs to reconstruct a vertex position
with good accuracy, provides a good uniformity of
response and was therefore not attempted. On the
other hand, Design 4 demonstrated that readout
from only one side was insuﬃcient to consistently
reconstruct a vertex position that would be useful
for correcting the energy response.

For Designs 2 and 3, we attempted various
methods to reconstruct the radial position. How-
ever, the reﬂectivity of the side walls made this
unreasonably diﬃcult. We did ﬁnd, however, that
a simple charge balance between the top and bot-
tom PMTs provided a very good correlation to the
true z-position. We deﬁne the measurable quan-
tity z-balance (Zbal) in the following way:

Zbal =

T op − Bottom
T op + Bottom

,

(1)

where T op and Bottom refer to the total num-
ber of photon hits recorded by the PMTs at the
top and bottom of the detector, respectively. The
correlation of this value to the true z-position for
Designs 2 and 3 can be seen in Fig. 6 and the rel-
ative positron energy response (similar to Fig. 5)
is plotted relative to this variable in Fig. 7. Us-
ing the data from Fig. 7, a multiplicative calibra-
tion constant for each bin in Zbal was constructed
to give the mean response. Rather than creating
an energy dependent calibration, the relative re-
sponses of the 1.5 and 3.5 MeV positron samples

FIG. 6: Correlation between the measurable z-
balance, as deﬁned in Eq. 1, and the true z-position

While the correlation is relatively linear for both de-
signs, one can see the non-linearity of Design 3 at the
extremes due to the energy leakage in the absence of

were averaged to provide a single calibration con-
stant for each bin. This procedure was repeated
for both detector designs and the calibration con-
stants were applied event-by-event.

As expected, after calibration the uniformity of
the response for both designs is improved (See
Fig. 8). Especially in the region of Zbal between
-.3 and .3, the relative diﬀerences are kept within
±1%—consistent with the uncalibrated perfor-
mance demonstrated in Design 1. One can also
note the larger error for Design 3 which arises from
the large response variation with radial position.

V. CONCLUSION

This work was an attempt to better understand
the design features that would aﬀect the response

neutrinos from nuclear power reactors. There are
some interesting trade-oﬀs that can be identiﬁed.
For example, Designs 2 and 4 oﬀer an interesting
compromise in eﬃciency and uniformity while De-
sign 1 shows that very good uniformity of response
can be achieved at the cost of a larger total detec-
tor size and an eﬃciency for event selection of only
50%. On the other hand, Design 3 demonstrates
the maximum eﬀective ﬁducial volume for the min-
imum total detector size at the cost of energy dis-
tortions as large as 40%. The optimal design will
depend on the goals and restrictions of the speciﬁc
installation.

Clearly improvement can be made to any and
all of these designs. It was perhaps interesting to
note that the expected uniformity from the two-
sided designs was hampered by the large radial
variations in energy response. Some more clever
design of the PMT distribution might be able to

10

improve this. Similarly, one might consider some
judiciously placed additional PMTs in Design 4 to
allow for some minimal reconstruction and cali-
bration.

In general, however, it appears that a compact
neutrino detector with overall dimensions on the
order of 3 m can be built with reasonably good
performance. Given that the energy resolution of
the scintillator is usually 7–10%, the 15% variation
in energy response is not extreme. It is the hope
of the authors that this work will prove useful to
those working on nuclear reactor monitoring and
can provide fruitful directions for future detector
development.

Abstract

Searches for weakly interacting massive particles(WIMP) can be based on the de-
tection of nuclear recoil energy in CsI(Tℓ) crystals. We demonstrate that low energy
gamma rays down to few keV is detected with CsI(Tℓ) crystal detector. A clear peak
at 6 keV is observed using X-ray source. Good energy resolution and linearity have
been achieved down to X-ray region. In addition, we also show that alpha particles
and gamma rays can be clearly separated using the diﬀerent time characteristics of
the crystal.

1 Introduction

Several evidences from a variety of sources indicate that the universe con-
tains a large amount of dark matter [1]. The most strong evidence for the
existence of dark matter comes from the galactic dynamics. There is simply
not enough luminous matter observed in spiral galaxies to account for the ob-
served rotational curves [2]. Among several dark matter candidates, one of the
most prominent candidate is the weakly-interacting massive particles(WIMP).
The leading WIMP candidate is perhaps the neutralino, the lightest super-
symmetric particles such as photinos, Higgsinos and Z-inos [3]. These particles
typically have masses between 10 GeV and a few TeV and couple to ordinary
matter only with weak interactions. The elastic scattering of WIMP with tar-
get nuclei could be detected by measuring the recoil energy of the nucleus,
which is up to several tens of keV [4]. Recently, a great deal of attention has
been drawn to crystal detectors since the detection technique is already devel-
oped and radioactive background from the crystal is under control. Especially,
the most stringent limit for the direct detection of WIMP has been established
using the NaI(Tl) crystal detector [5]. They achieved as low threshold as 6 keV
and relatively good separation between the recoiling events and the ionizing
events by background γ’s using the diﬀerence of the scintillation decay time.

Recently, positive signal of annual modulation has been reported by DAMA
group [6]. Looking at the similar sensitivity region with other experiments
which involves diﬀerent systematics is absolutely necessary to conﬁrm their
results. It has been noted by several authors that CsI(Tℓ) crystal may give
better performance for the separation between recoiling events and the ionizing
events by background γ [7]. Although the light yield of CsI(Tℓ) crystal is
slightly lower than NaI(Tl) crystal, better particle separation can be more
advantageous for WIMP search. Also CsI(Tℓ) has much less hygroscopicity
than NaI(Tl), and has higher density (see Table I). The spin-independent
cross section of WIMP is larger for CsI(Tℓ) than NaI(Tl) because CsI(Tℓ) has
a compound with two similar heavy mass nuclei while spin-dependent cross
section will be comparable. Moreover hundreds of tons of CsI(Tℓ) crystals are
already being used for several detectors in high energy experiment [8]. Thus
fabricating large amount of crystals is quite feasible. In this report, we have
studied the characteristics of CsI(Tℓ) crystal for the possibility of dark matter
search experiment [9].

2 Experimental Setup

We prepared a 3cm×3cm×3cm CsI(Tℓ) crystal with all surfaces polished.
Photo-multiplier tubes of 2 inch diameter(Hamamtsu H1161) are directly at-

2

tached on two opposite end surfaces. The cathode planes of PMT cover all
the area of the crystal surfaces attached. The other sides are wrapped with
1.5 µm thick aluminized foil window or Teﬂon tapes followed by black tapes.
It is necessary to use only very thin foil for the side where X-ray sources are
attached that low energy X-rays are not blocked. For the alpha source, ad-
ditional aluminum foil is located between the aluminized foil and the source
to reduce the α energy. Signals from both PMTs are then ampliﬁed using a
home-made AMP(×8) with low noise and high slew rate. Another signals are
ampliﬁed with ORTEC AMP(×200) to make the trigger logic. Discriminator
thresholds are set at the level of single photoelectron signal. By using LED,
we conﬁrmed that the single photoelectron signal is well above the electronic
noise. In order to suppress the accidental triggers from dark currents, we de-
lay the signal by 100 ns and then formed a self coincidence for each PMT
signal, which require that at least two photoelectrons occur within 200 ns.
Then coincidence of both PMT signals are made for the ﬁnal trigger decision.
In this way the trigger caused by the accidental noises are suppressed by a
great amount. With this condition the eﬀective threshold is four photoelec-
trons, which roughly corresponds to 40 photons produced. Using the widely
accepted light yield of CsI(Tℓ), ∼50,000 photons/MeV, our threshold can be
interpreted as 2 keV. The crystal and PMTs are located inside the of 5 cm
thick lead blocks in order to stop the environmental background. A digital
oscilloscope is used for the data taking with GPIB interface to a PC with
LINUX system. We developed DAQ system with GPIB and CAMAC inter-
face based on the ROOT package [10] and entire analysis was performed with
the ROOT package too. The schematics of the experimental setup and the
trigger elements are shown in Figure 1 a) and b). The digital oscilloscope we
used for our experiment samples the signal at 1 Gs/sec with 8 bit pulse height
information and two channels are read out simultaneously. Full pulse shape
informations are saved for the further analysis.

3 Calibration

We have performed measurements of X-rays, γ-rays, and alpha particles using
various radioactive sources with the setup described in the previous section.
The energy spectra of X-rays and γ rays from the 57Co source is given in
Fig. 2. The highest peak is from the gamma ray of 122 keV. Shown in left side
of broad distribution of pulses are the Compton edge. The energy resolution at
122 keV is about 7%. Also, the X-ray peak at 6.4 and 14.4 keV are clearly seen
with energy resolution of 30 and 20%, respectively. This resolution is not much
worse than that of NaI(Tl) crystal [5]. Many calibration sources such as 57Co,
109Cd, 137Cs, 54Mn and 60Co are used for the determination of linearity and
resolution. Fig. 3 shows the energy resolution of CsI(Tℓ) crystal with PMT on

, when we add PMT signals from both sides.

The pulse shape is quite linear at high energy as shown in Fig. 4 but there
is some deviation at low energy as shown in Fig. 5. The pulse height of the
662 keV γ-ray line from 137Cs is deﬁned as unity for the linearity plot. It
turns out that the variation in the response function near the L-, K-shell of
Cs and I causes nonlinearity at X-ray region within 30% [11]. This is because
photoelectrons ejected by incident gamma rays just above the K-shell energy
have very little kinetic energy so that the response drops. Just below this
energy, however, K-shell ionization is not possible and L-shell ionization takes
place. Since the binding energy is lower, the photoelectrons ejected at this
point are more energetic which causes a rise in the response. The pulse shape
is linear within 10 % up to low energy X-ray region if these eﬀects are corrected.

4 Pulse Shape Analysis

In many scintillating crystals, electrons and holes produced by ionization are
captured to form certain meta-stable states and produce slow timing com-
ponent. On the other hand, a larger stopping power from recoiling nucleus
produces a higher density of free electrons and holes which favors their recom-
bination into loosely bound systems and results in fast timing component. By
using this characteristic, we may be able to separate X-ray backgrounds from
the high ionization loss produced by WIMP. To demonstrate this diﬀerence,
we measured signals produced by alpha particles using 241Am source. Kinetic
energy of the alpha particle is 5.5 MeV and the incident energy was controlled
by the thickness of thin aluminum foil in front of the crystal. Although al-
pha particle at this energy stops in the crystal, the visible energy seen by the
PMT is about 75% of the energy. This is due to the quenching factor for alpha
particles and agrees with what were observed by the other experiments [12].
We show the two dimensional histogram of mean time vs. integrated charge

4

in Fig. 6. The mean time is the pulse height weighted time average, deﬁned as

< t >= P

ti × qi
qi

,

P

(3)

where qi is the amplitude of the pulse at the channel time ti up to 4 µs. It is
practically the same as the decay time of the crystal. Two clear bands in the
Fig. 6 indicate that we can make good separation between the alpha particle
and X-ray. The low energy of X-ray from the 241Am source is 60 keV. In Fig. 7,
we projected signals near 60 keV region to the mean time axis and it shows
that the decay time for alpha particles is ∼700 ns while for X-rays ∼1100 ns.
Two peaks are well separated by more than 3 sigma in this energy region.

5 Conclusion

We demonstrated that CsI(Tℓ) crystal can be used to measure low energy
gamma rays down to few keV. Linearity within 10% and good energy resolution
have been obtained down to 6 keV X-ray region. In addition, a good separation
of alpha particles from gamma rays has been achieved by using mean time
diﬀerence. If recoiled ions in the crystal behave similar to alpha particles,
the mean time diﬀerence would be very useful to diﬀerentiate WIMP signals
from backgrounds. The background study and neutron response on CsI(Tℓ)
study are underway. If this study is successful, a pilot experiment with a large
amount crystals will be launched in near future.

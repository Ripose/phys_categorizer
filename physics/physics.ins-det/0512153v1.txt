Abstract

The upgrade of the HERA accelerator has provided much increased collider lumi-
nosity. In turn, the improvements have necessitated a new design for the ZEUS
luminosity measurements. The intense synchrotron radiation ﬁeld, as well as the
high probability of a bremsstrahlung photon in each bunch crossing, posed new ex-
perimental constraints. In this report, we describe how these challenges were met
with the ZEUS luminosity spectrometer system. The design, testing and commis-
sioning of the device are described, and the results from the initial operational
experience are reported.

1 Introduction

ZEUS is one of two detectors accumulating data from electron-proton beam
collisions at the HERA accelerator operated by the DESY laboratory in Ham-
burg, Germany. Analyses of such data have provided quantitative values of
cross sections and derivative information related to the proton’s quark and
gluon content, Quantum Chromodynamics, and other issues relevant to the
Standard Model and beyond. In September 2000, HERA completed an eight
year running period (HERA-I), which provided measurements of deep inelastic
scattering (DIS), photoproduction, and other processes in a newly accessible
kinematic regime. HERA underwent a luminosity upgrade in 2001 [1]. The
goal was to increase the HERA-I peak luminosity by a factor of 5. In addition

to the accelerator modiﬁcations necessary to achieve this, spin rotators were
installed to provide electron beam longitudinal polarization of about 40% on
average. A new physics program (HERA-II) began in 2002 to make accurate
measurements of small cross sections with polarized beams.

Precise knowledge of the luminosity is required for precise determination of
a cross section associated with any process; such measurements depend on
luminosity integrated over time, R Ldt, to normalize the numbers of events
observed during the same time period. Luminosity had been measured [2,3,4]
in HERA-I using the rate of high energy photons from the bremsstrahlung
epγ, produced by the colliding beams. This process is well un-
process, ep
derstood, has a high rate and an accurately calculable cross section. Produced
photons follow the direction of the colliding beam electrons and are observed
about 100 m downstream, after the electron and proton beams have been
magnetically separated. The ZEUS HERA-I technique, with a calorimeter to
directly measure all bremsstrahlung photons faces new diﬃculties at HERA-II,
including the following:

A signiﬁcant increase in direct synchrotron radiation (SR) ﬂux from the
electron beam occurs due to the higher beam currents and to a new beam
focusing scheme to optimize high luminosity near the interaction region.
Much larger numbers of overlaid bremsstrahlung events (pile-up) occur.
Colliding bunches producing more than one photon are not separated in the
calorimeter technique. HERA-II luminosity implies a signiﬁcant probability
(approaching unity) for several ﬁnal state photons with Eγ > 0.5 GeV in
each bunch-crossing.
There are additional requirements for accurate cross sections using polarized
beam electrons (or positrons).

The HERA beams each consist of 220 bunches separated by 96 ns. A few
bunches are unﬁlled; the empty bunches are used for monitoring purposes and
they are also needed for the proton beam abort system, and the unpaired
bunches are used to measure small backgrounds resulting from the electron
or proton beam interacting with residual gas near the intersection region. Af-
ter acceleration, the polarization of the electron beam [5] rises from P = 0
to P = 50% over a period of about τ
40 minutes and the beam polar-
ization might be diﬀerent for each bunch. Therefore, the luminosity must be
measured accurately for each bunch over time intervals much less than τ . In
addition, a fast luminosity measurement is essential for obtaining collisions,
and monitoring and optimizing luminosity during a ﬁll.

∼

The required accuracy in the luminosity measurement for HERA-II is
2%,
which is similar to the most accurate luminosity measurement achieved at
HERA-I. The luminosity spectrometer described in this paper utilizes a new
method of measuring luminosity at ZEUS which addresses the new problems

of synchrotron ﬂux, pile-up, and other requirements, while meeting the speci-
ﬁcations for luminosity accuracy required by ZEUS physics goals.

In the spectrometer system, the bremsstrahlung photons are detected through
e+ + e−, in material of a beam-
their well understood pair conversion, γ
pipe exit window well downstream of the interaction region where these pho-
tons have been spatially separated from the circulating beams. After the con-
verted electron pair 1 has been spatially split by the magnetic ﬁeld of a dipole
magnet, the particles are individually detected by two small electromagnetic
calorimeters placed at transverse distances separated from the direct syn-
chrotron radiation and unconverted bremsstrahlung beams. The observed rate
of converted photons is proportional to the luminosity, as described in Sec. 4.

→

This setup reduces dramatically the requirements on data rate for the spec-
trometer calorimeters, since the primary photon beam bypasses them and the
magnet insures that the large ﬂux of low energy electrons from synchrotron
photon conversions in material upstream of the magnet are swept away from
10%) in the window
the detectors. Due to the small conversion fraction (
and the limited accepted energy range, the pile-up problem is reduced by two
orders of magnitude, so that multiple observed photons constitute only a few
percent of the rate even at the highest luminosities expected for HERA-II.

∼

With the relaxed rate requirements on the spectrometer calorimeters, their
design can be sophisticated enough to simultaneously provide relatively pre-
cise measurements of the converted electron energies and positions — in turn
giving similarly precise information for the bremsstrahlung photon. The re-
dundancy and precision of the measurements provide important assurance on
many aspects of the acceptance which must be known accurately with this
technique. In general, the technique is simple and accurate, and works well at
high luminosities.

The structure of this paper is as follows: in Sec. 2 are presented the details of
the design of the luminosity spectrometer, including the calorimeter modules
and a brief description of the data acquisition system. The detector calibration
in a momentum analyzed electron test beam, and the reconstruction of photon
properties from the calorimeter measurements are described in Sec. 3. The
method of calculating the luminosity is described in Sec. 4, and the in situ
calibration and operating performance during the ﬁrst months of HERA-II
operation are presented in Sec. 5.

1 In this paper, ”electron” is meant to specify both electron or positron. Note that,
aside from the direction of bend in the ﬁeld, their interactions are identical at these
energies.

2 Spectrometer design and components

A schematic layout of the spectrometer system is shown in Fig. 1. The co-
ordinate system is deﬁned with the positive z-axis along the photon beam
direction, y pointing upwards and x along the line away from the center of
the HERA ring. Here we describe each component in the order encountered
by a photon, beginning at the exit window of the photon beam pipe, through
the collimators, magnet, and the calorimeters. Relevant aspects of the data
acquisition system are also described.

Fig. 1. Schematic showing major elements of the luminosity spectrometer. Note
the very diﬀerent scales for transverse and beam directions, and note that the exit
window is 92.5 m downstream of the ep nominal interaction point. The origin for
the transverse coordinates (x, y) was chosen at the center of the exit window.

The bremsstrahlung photons from the intersection region travel through a
long vacuum pipe terminating at an exit window, at 92 m from the nominal
intersection point (IP). Upstream of the window inside the vacuum chamber
(not shown in Fig. 1) are various aperture restrictions such as collimators,
magnets, and other apparatus. Figure 2 shows the picture of a foil sensitive
to synchrotron radiation, which was located in the beamline near the front
face of the calorimeters. The foil clearly indicates the aperture delimited by
upstream obstacles. For scale, the maximum horizontal extent of the aperture
is 9 cm. The maximum vertical limits are representative of the 7 cm aperture
of the ﬁxed collimator.

The window, at the upstream end of the spectrometer system, terminates the
vacuum so that the remainder of the detection system is in air. Approximately
10% of the photons convert into e+e− pairs in the window. The typical energy
of photons of interest is about 20 GeV. The distributions in x and y photon
impact positions at the window within the acceptance region reﬂect primarily
the angular divergence of the primary beam electrons as they collide in the
upstream ZEUS interaction region.

Fig. 2. Foil irradiated by synchrotron radiation. It was located near the front face
of the calorimeters. The eﬀects of aperture restrictions between the IP and the foil
are clearly visible.

The converted electron pairs that successfully traverse subsequent collimators
closely follow the original photon direction, until they encounter the magnetic
dipole where they are split vertically. The magnetic ﬁeld is such that a typ-
y directions with a
ical 10 GeV electron (positron) will then travel in the
vertical angle of about 10−2 rad, and encounter the calorimeters, whose verti-
10 cm from the incident photon
cal midpoints are displaced approximately
beam. The calorimeter modules permit measurements of the electrons’ x and
y positions with resolution of about 1.0 mm, and energies with resolution
of about 5% at 10 GeV. Calibrations in an electron test beam (described in
Sec. 3) and in operation with the spectrometer (described in Sec. 5) verify
these calorimeter measurement precisions.

±

Events with electrons detected in both calorimeter modules are used to recon-
struct the original photon’s energy and transverse coordinates. The measured
coincidence rate permits calculation of luminosity, as described in Sec. 4. The
bremsstrahlung position distributions, while relevant to luminosity calcula-
tions, also provide a diagnostic of the interaction region for HERA operation.

The locations of the diﬀerent spectrometer elements were obtained from opti-
cal survey and veriﬁed with beam data. Transverse distances are known to a
precision of order 1 mm while the dimensions along the direction of the beam
are known with a precision of better than 1 cm. These accuracies satisfy the
requirements for the luminosity measurement.

Components of the exit window, as measured by mass spectroscopy.

The diameter of the window is 100 mm. The window thickness was measured
at several positions; the average thickness was 9.883
0.003 mm with an
RMS of 0.0054 mm, implying at least that level of uniformity. The fraction
of converted photons in the window is therefore also uniform over the surface
of the window. The variation in the cross section for photon energies between
5 GeV and 20 GeV is
1% [6]; within the narrower energy window used
for luminosity measurements, the energy dependence is very small and well
simulated.

≈

±

The radiation length of the exit window alloy is X0 = 8.23 cm, which means
that the exit window itself represents 0.12X0, so that about 8.8% of interesting
photons convert in the window. Converted electrons traveling through the
material may subsequently radiate and lose a fraction of their energy. This
eﬀect is small, well understood, and simulated accurately. Also simulated is
the multiple scattering of converted electrons, which leads to typical RMS
10−4 rad and a transverse spread at the calorimeter
2.8
deﬂections of θx ≈
3.4 mm. The resolution of reconstructed photon conversion
front surface of
≈
positions is dominated by this multiple scattering of electrons in the window.

2.2 Collimators

The collimators are used to select observed photons within a rectangular region
inside the transverse dimensions of the vacuum pipe and within the uniform
ﬁeld region of the magnetic ﬁeld.

×

The ﬁxed collimator is a block of stainless steel, 30 cm long, with internal
70mm2. It shields the calorimeters and the magnet from
aperture ∆x∆y = 96
exposure to direct bremsstrahlung or synchrotron radiation photons from the
circulating electron beam. However, measurements from synchrotron radiation
indicate that beam elements upstream of the exit window more stringently
limit the photon aperture, as shown in Fig. 2 and veriﬁed with bremsstrahlung
measurements described in Sec. 4.

6

The moving (slit) collimator is a 15 cm long, water-cooled block of copper.
When inserted, it restricts bremsstrahlung photons to pass through a narrow
2mm2) slit 2 . During normal running conditions, the moving
(∆x∆y = 110
collimator is out of the beam. When inserted it allows precise calibration of
the absolute energy scale of the calorimeter channels (see Sec. 5).

×

2.3 Dipole magnet

The spectrometer uses a 60 cm long dipole magnet with a 10 cm horizontal
0.5 T. The bottom of the proton
aperture and typical ﬁeld strength of Bx ≈
beam pipe passes only a few centimeters above the top of the bremsstrahlung
aperture and the eﬀect of the dipole ﬁeld on proton beam operation must be
minimal. Hence magnetic shielding is arranged in the vicinity of the magnet
around the proton beam-pipe. The shielding is a cylinder of diameter 85 mm,
and centered at x = 17 mm, y = 126.7 mm with respect to our coordinate
system (and the center of the magnet).

Fig. 3. The points show data of the magnetic ﬁeld integrated along the beam di-
rection as a function of the dipole excitation current. The magnet is very linear in
the region of normal operation, and only slightly non-linear at the highest currents,
where measurements of the bremsstrahlung end point were made.

The magnetic ﬁeld was measured, using a Hall probe, as a function of position
at several diﬀerent magnet currents [7]. The integrated magnetic ﬁeld in the
central region versus excitation current, shown in Fig. 3, indicates that the
ﬁeld is linear over the range of normal operation, and saturates slightly at
the highest excitation currents used. The position dependent measurements
have been interpolated using Maxwell’s equations supplemented with a Ja-
cobi relaxation method to obtain the full and continuous magnetic ﬁeld map.

2 The height was optimized for high rate while maintaining small edge eﬀects.

This map was implemented in the simulation program. The systematic er-
rors have been estimated using the OPERA program [8,9]; the diﬀerences are
shown in Fig. 4 over a region which encompasses the full transverse aperture.
Uncertainties thus estimated were typically less than 1% throughout the ac-
ceptance region encompassed within 96
70 mm, with an average uncertainty
less than 0.5% near the region of highest ﬂux. Therefore, the magnetic ﬁeld
is well understood and creates an even smaller uncertainty on the precision of
the luminosity measurement.

2.4 Calorimeters

The two calorimeter modules were originally constructed as “Beam pipe calorime-
ters” (BPCs) in ZEUS to measure DIS processes at very low values of Q2 [10].
They were designed to measure positions and energies of electrons near the
HERA beam energy (27.5 GeV). The original description of their construc-
tion can be found in [11,12]. For this application, one module was rebuilt in
order to ﬁt within the space constraints. The main parameters are listed in
the Tab. 2 and the relevant properties and changes are elaborated here.

Both BPC modules are segmented tungsten-scintillator sampling calorimeters,
permitting simultaneous measurement of the electron’s energy and transverse
position of impact. The passive layers contain 26 plates of 3.5 mm thick tung-
sten alloy. These 24 electromagnetic radiation lengths (X0) are more than ad-
equate for longitudinal containment in this application. The active elements
consist of scintillator ﬁngers, alternating after each plate in the x and y direc-
tions, each ﬁnger 7.9 mm wide and 2.6 mm thick. One end of each ﬁnger is
aluminized to provide an eﬃcient end reﬂector. Each scintillator is optically

decoupled from its neighbors by a wrapping of 27.5 µm aluminum foil. The
net eﬀective width of each ﬁnger, including wrapping and air gaps, is 8.0 mm.

The other end of each scintillator ﬁnger rests against a wavelength shifting
(WLS) bar 7 mm wide and 2 mm thick. The scintillator ﬁngers oriented in
alternate layers, in the longitudinal direction, are observed with one WLS bar
representing a single readout channel. Each bar is viewed by a photomultiplier
(PMT) from the rear. The WLS is aluminized at the front end to reduce
attenuation eﬀects. To compensate for remaining attenuation in the WLS
bars, they were wrapped in reﬂective correction masks to ensure longitudinally
uniform response from each scintillator located along the length of a bar. The
geometry of some WLS bars required redesign for this application; they were
bent and pointed toward the new locations of the Hamamatsu R5600U-03
PMTs [13].

Each module has 16 channels for x-position reconstruction. For the y-position,
the lower module has 15 channels and the upper 11 channels, reﬂecting limita-
tions imposed by the small separation between the photon beam and the pro-
ton beam pipe. The 84 mm transverse separation of the modules is maintained
by rigid brass bars. Since the calorimeter containment vessels incorporate 5
mm of tungsten on surfaces adjacent to the beam, the net transverse distance
between inner scintillators of the two modules is 94 mm. These positions and
the trajectories of electrons after traversal of the magnetic ﬁeld are discussed
more fully in Sec. 3.

In order to protect the calorimeters from radiation due to scattered syn-
chrotron radiation, the unconstrained sides and rear were shielded by bricks
and sheets made of lead. Also, a thin (5 mm) sheet of lead was placed in
front of the modules. A system of light emitting diodes (LEDs) provides fast
light pulses to all PMTs of a module simultaneously under remote command.
This system permits the relative PMT gains to be monitored for short term

9

changes. The LED system also provided an independent monitor of deadtime
eﬀects.

The relative channel-to-channel gains were initially set using test beam elec-
trons, described in Sec. 3. The relative response of each channel was monitored
in situ with calibration runs as described in Sec. 5. The calibration runs were
important, especially during early running when unstable beam operation cre-
ated changes in channel-to-channel response. (These were found to primarily
arise from irradiation of WLSs near the PMTs.) Changes were monitored and
compensated to maintain the relative gains of all readout channels within a
module as well as the relative average gains of the two modules.

2.5 Data Acquisition System

One important challenge in this application is accurate digitization of the
calorimeter PMT signals, which are separated by the 96 ns HERA bunch
spacing. In order to minimize noise, analog processors were located in the
HERA tunnel close to the detectors. These electronics are inaccessible dur-
ing normal HERA running. The digital electronics is accessible, located in
the ZEUS main hall about 100 m upstream of the luminosity detectors. The
spectrometer data acquisition system (DAQ) was designed and constructed by
the ZEUS Krakow group [14] and DESY electronics development group, and
is common to the luminosity calorimeter system and the 6 meter tagger[15].
The latter system records the energies of ﬁnal state bremsstrahlung electrons
with energies complementary to those accepted by the spectrometer.

Figure 5 outlines the full system. The digitized signal is used immediately
in the triggering system and retained for the luminosity calculation. In more
detail, the readout system consists of the following components:

•

•

•

The front-end electronics (FEE) is the analog system of ampliﬁers and
drivers used to shape and transmit the analog PMT signals to the digi-
tal system.
The digital electronics includes eight ﬂash analog-to-digital converter (FADC)
boards, four memory boards (MB), and one trigger board (TB). Each MB
performs operations on the data as well as storage. All are located in a
single VME crate.
A PC, operating under LINUX, for online processing of the data and cal-
culation of the ZEUS luminosity.

The signal from each PMT is transferred through a 6 m long cable to the FEE
crates. The FEE amplify and shape these signals and drive them through the
135 m long RG213 transmission lines to the digitization units in the ZEUS hall.
Additionally, the FEE crates each contain driver modules for an LED (input

signals are sent to the nearby FEE system. The analog signals then travel to the
ZEUS hall to be processed by the digital system in a VME crate.

to the PMT cathodes) and charge-injector to the FEE ampliﬁers. These can be
independently triggered to test both the PMTs and the remainder of the DAQ
system. The analog signals are integrated with a time constant of 65 ns and
subsequently digitized by 12-bit FADC modules operating at about 10 MHz,
synchronously with the HERA beam bunches. Each FADC board consists of
a pole-zero ﬁlter, which shapes the input analog signal to reduce the decay
tail. Digitized values from each PMT for each bunch crossing are transferred
to the 16-channel MBs residing in the same VME crate. The MB performs the
following operations on each signal:

•

•

•

A subtraction is made of the stored digital value from the previous bunch
crossing to provide a dynamic pedestal subtraction. In the process, low fre-
quency noise (compared to 10 MHz) is removed. The low rates in all chan-
nels of the spectrometer ensure few mistakes due to signals in consecutive
bunches.
Sums are made of all the channels in each dimension of the upper (xup,
yup) and lower (xdn, ydn) calorimeters, resulting in four energy sums (Eup
x ,
Eup
y ) in each crossing contained in the four MBs. These sums are
retained with the signals from the individual channels. The sums are also
sent to the TB where they are used for triggering decisions (data retention)
on each beam crossing.
Meanwhile the data have been placed in a buﬀer to await the trigger de-
cision. For events in which the TB ﬂags the event as useful, the data are
copied sequentially to output buﬀers. These buﬀers are read continuously
via VME at a rate up to 10 kHz.

x , Edn

y , Edn

11

The TB, in the VME crate with the MBs, communicates with the MBs through
a custom backplane. The programmable TB decides when an event satisﬁes
speciﬁed criteria; if so, it sets an ACCEPT signal on the backplane. The
criteria utilize two digital sums: one (Eup) from all the xup and yup channels;
the other from the corresponding sum (Edn) in the down detector. Only events
that pass a nominal threshold value in each of the two detectors are passed
on for further consideration.

If the MB buﬀer were to become full, data acquisition must halt until buﬀer
space is available. This is a situation requiring deadtime corrections, which
are best minimized. Therefore, at the highest luminosities, a trigger prescale
factor is applied to maintain an average rate well below the maximum trigger
rate of 10 kHz. The TB provides counters that record (1) the total number
of HERA bunches and (2) the number in which the MB buﬀer is not full and
active. When the MB buﬀer is full and incoming data must be discarded, the
active-time counter stops counting. These counter values, sent to the online
PC each second, provide a continuous deadtime correction for the luminosity
calculation and also permit this deadtime to be monitored. The deadtime
correction and the prescale factor are independently measured using light test
events by recording both the LED signal rate and the rate at which these events
are recorded. The prescale factor was set to 3 during HERA high luminosity
running.

Data from accepted events are transferred to output MB buﬀers and sent
via VME bus to the online PC. The information is used to reconstruct the
energy and position information for the detected photon, as described in Sec 3,
and is stored in histograms for monitoring purposes. The ZEUS luminosity
is calculated oﬄine using histograms and counters saved to tape every 16
seconds, as described in Sec. 4.

3 Calorimeter Reconstruction of Electrons and Photons

3.1 Reconstructing electron energies and positions

The functions of the calorimeter modules are to measure the energies and
transverse coordinates of the two electrons, respectively in the up (up) and
down (dn) calorimeters, using the information recorded from the PMT chan-
nels associated with the horizontal and vertical strips. The calorimeters were
extensively tested in a DESY-II electron beam at energies up to 6 GeV, prior
to installation in the HERA tunnel. Described here are the algorithms used to
transform the charges recorded by the PMTs into the incident electron energy
(energy calibration) and the transverse position coordinates, as well as the

12

tests performed in the electron test beam. The measurements show that the
calibration precision is more than adequate for the present task. The position
and energy resolutions, leakage eﬀects, as well as remaining attenuation in
the scintillator strips were also measured with the test beam. The measured
leakage and attenuation eﬀects with test beam have been used to correct the
energy reconstruction of data. Further calibration checks on the modules were
performed in the spectrometer conﬁguration, as described in Sec. 5, in order
to maintain the calibration during operation.

The preliminary settings of the PMT gains were set using an LED system.
Also, by varying the high voltages applied to the PMTs, an empirical function
was obtained providing the relative gain variation with high voltage, indepen-
dently for each channel. Additional tests, including absolute calibrations, were
carried out in the test beam.

The test beam setup located each module on a movable table, which could
be translated horizontally and vertically by known amounts with a stepping
motor. The electron test beam was focused, steered, and momentum deﬁned
by magnetic beam elements. Counters constrained the beam to be within a
transverse circle of 3.0 mm diameter. Initially, the module was located with
the 5.0 GeV beam incident near its center. The gains of the PMTs were set
to nominal values, and the resulting net charge (in ADC counts) from each
PMT channel was recorded for each event as the module was scanned hori-
zontally or vertically. Using these scans, the PMT gains were then adjusted,
by changing the applied voltage according to the empirical functions previ-
ously measured, so that the peak charge was the same for all channels. This
procedure converged after a single iteration.

Figure 6 shows typical data (points) from four adjacent channels in such a
horizontal scan. The points joined by a continuous curve represent a single
channel’s response. Recalling that an individual scintillator width is 8.0 mm,
the ﬁgure also illustrates that electron showers typically deposit a substantial
fraction of their energy in at least two channels, but very little energy is outside
four channels.

By repeating such horizontal scans at diﬀerent vertical positions, any uncom-
pensated light attenuation in the scintillator was measured so its eﬀects could
be corrected during analysis. The overall gains were set so that the total ener-
gies for electrons incident at the midpoint of the module from the horizontal
and vertical channels were equal. From the known beam energy, the charge
response was calibrated directly to the sampled energy as a parameter Si for
the ith channel as Si = energy divided by average recorded charge. These
parameters were then used to reconstruct shower energy as described below.

To minimize noise, only strips near the shower maximum were actually used

3.2 Reconstructing bremsstrahlung energy and position

The operation of the calorimeter modules in the bremsstrahlung beam is dis-
cussed in detail in Sec. 5. We note that, in this geometry where the up and dn
calorimeters measure the two electrons, the original photon may be directly
reconstructed from these measurements. The energy of the photon is

and the transverse y-position (bend plane of magnet) is

The energy weighting in the last equation arises because the magnet imparts

4 Luminosity Calculation

Colliding beam luminosity is quantitatively related to the circulating beam
currents and the spatial overlap as they intersect. By deﬁnition, the integrated
luminosity in the collision region provides the normalization for any cross
section so that, if Nint events of a speciﬁc process are observed during the
time period during which the integrated luminosity is known, then the cross
section for that process is

σ = Nint/Lint,

where Lint is typically speciﬁed in units of inverse picobarns pb

−1.

4.1 Instantaneous and speciﬁc luminosities

The instantaneous luminosity (Linst = dLint/dt) is deﬁned, for the purposes of
this paper, to be the luminosity averaged over the period between accelerator
bunch crossings (96 ns). Since Linst scales with the product of the electron (Ie)
and proton (Ip) currents, it is convenient to deﬁne the speciﬁc instantaneous
luminosity

where the sum includes the currents in all colliding bunches.

4.2 Luminosity Measurement

The most accurate method for measuring luminosity is to measure the rate
from a process whose cross section is large and well known. At HERA, lu-
minosity is calculated from the measured rate, R, of photons created in the
bremsstrahlung process ep
epγ. The energy spectrum of bremsstrahlung
photons is accurately described by the Bethe-Heitler formula [16], shown in
Fig. 10 as the product of energy and diﬀerential cross section, in millibarns, as
a function of photon energy. Additional corrections from radiative processes
aﬀecting the spectrum at energies above 5 GeV are well understood and in-
corporated into calculated cross sections. The photons of interest here are
those whose converted electrons have energies appropriate to enter and trig-
ger both calorimeter modules. As discussed below, the nominal magnetic ﬁeld

the electron beam energy (27.5 GeV) is readily apparent.

and geometry are such that the photon energies of interest are typically near
20 GeV.

Luminosity is obtained from the equation

Linst =

R
f Aσ

,

(10)

where σ is the bremsstrahlung cross section integrated over the same energy
interval as the measurement of R. The parameter, f , represents the fraction of
photons in the bremsstrahlung beam that convert into electron pairs in the ma-
terial upstream of the magnet, primarily in the exit window. The acceptance,
A, includes the overall probability (not included in f ) for a photon created
at the intersection region to be observed as an e+e− pair in the spectrometer.
Imprecise knowledge of A creates the largest uncertainty in the measurement,
as will be discussed in detail below. The acceptance of the luminosity system
depends primarily on two issues:

•

•

obstacles upstream of the entry to the luminosity system that remove pho-
tons from the edges of the bremsstrahlung beam;
the fraction of the converted pairs in which both electrons are accepted into
the ﬁducial areas of the calorimeters.

The conversion fraction and these two contributions to the acceptance will be
discussed in turn.

4.3 Conversion fraction, f

The fraction of photons converted into e+e− pairs depends on (a) the absolute
and energy-dependent pair production cross section and (b) the details of the

Fig. 11. The distribution of the fraction of the photon energy carried by one of the
electrons after conversion.

conversion material in the exit window and the air between the exit window
and the magnet. 4 The materials and thickness of the exit window are well
understood, and described in detail in Sec. 2. The total pair production cross
section on each nucleus is largely independent of photon energy and is given to
good accuracy by a simple formula that depends on the radiation length and
other well-understood properties of the converting material. The diﬀerential
cross section for one electron of the pair to retain a fraction, z, of the photon
energy, shown in Fig. 11, is also largely independent of energy.

The conversion eﬃciency and acceptance used in this analysis were calcu-
lated using the full GEANT 3.21 simulation. Subsequent propagation and
interactions of the electrons used the fully parameterized magnetic ﬁeld map
discussed in Sec. 2.

4.4 Upstream Obstacles

The acceptance includes a correction for incoming photons obscured by up-
stream obstacles. The unobscured region was delineated in two independent
ways: (a) the aperture obtained from a foil sensitive to synchrotron radia-
tion described in Sec. 2; and (b) measurements of the transverse tails of the
bremsstrahlung beam obtained by moving its centroid across the aperture. The
two methods agree in detail as shown in Fig. 12, where the sharp contour de-
lineates the x
y region indicated by illumination of the foil shown in Fig. 2.
The elliptical contours show regions observed from bremsstrahlung photons
due to beam collisions at the intersection region as the electron beam was
steered through various incident angles. The regions from the bremsstrahlung
runs in Fig. 12 can be seen to outline the same aperture as that indicated
from synchrotron radiation.

Fig. 12. Probability contours showing densities of observed events as the electron
beam was steered to center the bremsstrahlung beam near the aperture edges. The
data corroborate the aperture (solid contour) obtained using synchrotron radiation.

With beams steered in their nominal directions, Fig. 13 shows a typical mea-
surement of the x
y contours due to bremsstrahlung produced by the inter-
secting beams. Note that the intersecting beam proﬁle has a clear elliptical
shape, wider in the horizontal than the vertical. The major axis of the el-
lipse is seen to be rotated around the beam direction. The detailed shape was
found to ﬁt orthogonal Gaussians at axes rotated by about 10 degrees to the
horizontal. Typical distributions, projected along the orthogonal rotated axes,
had standard deviations about 2 cm along the more horizontal axis and 1 cm
along the more vertical axis. The ﬁtted 1D distributions are discussed further
in Sec. 5.

4.5 Converted Pairs Accepted into Calorimeter

The spectrometer acceptance depends on the fraction of photons converted
upstream of the magnet for which both electrons of the pair enter the calorime-
ters. This acceptance depends strongly on the distribution in z shown in Fig. 11
and on the energy of the interacting photons, Eγ, because of the deﬂection of
each electron by the magnetic ﬁeld.

Most of the acceptance dependence on z and Eγ can be understood from ele-
mentary arguments. Consider photons traveling along a beam axis transversely
located midway between the calorimeter modules with y = 0 5 . Each elec-
tron acquires the same transverse momentum, in opposite directions, from the
ﬁeld traversal: pT = 0.3 R Bxdz, where the integral represents the integrated
magnetic ﬁeld (in Tm) along the path through the magnet. At the nominal
0.1 GeV. The deﬂection of an elec-
running current (225 A), the value of pT ≈
tron of momentum p (in GeV/c) in the magnetic ﬁeld can be approximated
as

y = ℓ

pT
p

,

where ℓ is the distance from the center of the magnet to the calorimeters.
Only when the values of y for each electron are such that both enter “good”
calorimeter regions are events accepted. If the fraction of the photon energy
acquired by the upwardly deﬂected electron is z = p/Eγ, the other electron
z of the photon energy. It follows that z and Eγ are
acquires a fraction 1
directly related to the electrons’ locations. The locations of the electrons in
the upper (yup) and lower (ydn) calorimeter modules are related to z and Eγ
as follows:

−

zEγ =

ℓpT
yup

(1

z)Eγ =

.

The inner and outer y-limits of the ﬁducial areas of the two calorimeters
therefore delineate limits in the plane of z versus Eγ that are accepted. This
is illustrated in Fig. 14, where the limits due to the outer and inner y-limits
of the upper and lower calorimeter modules deﬁne the accepted region to be
that internal to the curves.

If all photons arrived with coordinate yγ = 0, the acceptance at ﬁxed Eγ would
be the integral of the function in Fig. 11 over the accepted z-range shown

5 The actual vertical coordinate origin described here is oﬀset about 0.5 cm in
our system. (See Figs. 1 and 18.) A hypothetical simpliﬁed case is used here for
pedagogical reasons.

observed photon within the ﬁducial region of both calorimeters which is therefore
accepted.

cross-hatched in Fig. 14. This simple acceptance function is shown as the
solid line in Fig. 15. The result of a more detailed Monte Carlo calculation for
this beam conﬁguration, the points in the same ﬁgure, shows that this simple
model gives the major features of the acceptance. Note that the coincidence
requirement of two electrons without any restriction on energy provides an
acceptance approximating that shown in Fig. 15. This description, as discussed
more fully in Sec. 5, permits luminosity to be measured which only indirectly
depends on energy calibration. At the same time, consistent comparisons of
the relevant data distributions with predictions validate the calibration.

The actual acceptance, however, varies slightly from the curve shown in Fig. 15
because the photon beam’s ﬁnite extent in y creates complications. Photons
displaced from the beam centroid shifts the contours in Fig. 14 by amounts
of order 10% for each centimeter of y-displacement. In addition, though the
calorimeters sample the full transverse range of the transmitted beam, the
correlations between vertical beam coordinate, photon energy, and acceptance
require that we address the beam properties in the acceptance calculations.
Full acceptance calculations include the entire spectrometer setup, the mea-
sured beam shape, and the complete shower development in the calorimeters
as described in Sec. 5.

4.6 Small Corrections and Uncertainties

The magnet current was chosen so that, during normal operation, the data
cover the ﬂat part of the bremsstrahlung energy spectrum in Fig. 10. This
ensures that the sensitivities to energy scales and alignments are minimized.
Certain additional, small corrections were included, as described here.

actual conditions and responses.

The measured rate requires correction for backgrounds from electron beam
interactions with the residual gas in the beam pipe. This is determined by
utilizing the measured coincidence rates corresponding to pilot bunches with
electrons unpaired with proton bunches. For typical running conditions this
eﬀect on the luminosity measurement is
1%, and the uncertainty is much
less. Proton beam related backgrounds are negligible. Correction for multiple
photons observed in a single bunch crossing is also negligible. The overall
precision of the luminosity measurement is discussed more fully in Sec. 5

∼

5 System Operation

Luminosity measurements provided by the spectrometer system utilize spectra
of the bremsstrahlung photon position and energy from the calorimeters. In
situ procedures allowed for continuous validation of the precisions for these
quantities. Specifying accurately (a) the axes of the beam coordinate system
relative to the calorimeter modules; and (b) the relative and absolute energy
measurements by the calorimeters were necessary in circumstances in which
these changed over time. These issues are discussed in turn.

5.1 Position Measurements

The photon position is derived directly from the measurements of the individ-
ual electrons as speciﬁed in Eqns. 6 and 7. Measurements in the two transverse
directions have somewhat diﬀerent precisions.

23

Because electrons are deﬂected by the magnetic ﬁeld primarily in the verti-
cal plane, the horizontal positions in the upper and lower calorimeters should
be nearly equal. The average (Eqn. 6) is used to estimate the value of xγ.
Fig. 16 shows the complementary diﬀerence between up and down measure-
xdn)/2]. The expected mean of this quantity should be nearly
ments [(xup −
zero and the standard deviation should be similar to the error on xγ. The ob-
served RMS of about 3 mm is close to the anticipated value, and is dominated
by the scattering of the electrons in the exit window. The small oﬀset of the
mean is attributed to uncorrected vertical components of the magnetic ﬁeld
and a small horizontal misalignment of the calorimeter modules.

Figure 17, the spectrum of reconstructed yγ coordinates obtained with the
2 mm high slit collimator inserted, provides a rough estimate of the RMS
for measurements of yγ. Note that this measurement is compromised by the
correlations with the energy measurement reﬂected in Eqn. 7, but also by the
ﬁnite width of the slit, and by scattering from the slit edges. Hence, the RMS
of 7 mm should be considered an upper limit on the actual precision on yγ.
The edge scattering also is known to produce the tails in the distribution of
Fig. 17.

Because the calibration of the calorimeter energy scale depends on vertical
alignment, as described in Sec. 4, a technique for validating the vertical colli-
mator axis origin was important. Accomplishing this utilized the fact that the
rates in upper and lower calorimeter modules must be equal at equal vertical
distances from the beam centroid. Figure 18, the ratio of electron rate in up
and down detectors while the slit collimator was inserted versus y0, the oﬀset
of the collimator centroid, illustrates the determination of the correct oﬀset.
From the ﬁgure, we see that the oﬀset of the collimator midpoint was located

Examples of projected beam proﬁles for xγ and yγ are shown in Fig. 19 and
Fig. 20, respectively, on logarithmic scales. The Monte Carlo simulation (his-
togram) reproduces the measured data (points) well, even on the tails where
the rate has fallen signiﬁcantly. The plots justify the use of single Gaussians ﬁts
to the beam proﬁles in the Monte Carlo calculation providing the acceptance.

It is possible for the beam to continually change mean positions and widths
by small amounts in either dimension. Hence measurements of beam proﬁles
for xγ and yγ are recorded every 16 seconds 6 , so that corrections for the
upstream aperture restrictions and beam parameters were made continuously
to the luminosity calculation.

6 This sampling time is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the typical
beam polarization time, and substantially smaller than typical changes in the beam
proﬁle.

5.2 Energy Measurements

The individual electron energies, from a bremsstrahlung photon conversion,
are related to their vertical displacements at the calorimeter relative to the
photon position (Eqn. 12). When the slit collimator is inserted, the distance
of the reconstructed electron from the collimator opening (as determined in
Sec. 5.1 and Fig. 18), along with the R Bdz from the ﬁeld map, provide an
accurate measure of the electron energy. Data taken in this conﬁguration were
used to determine the individual channel gains Si in Eqn. 1. Because the posi-
tion reconstruction depends weakly on the values of the Si as seen in Eqn. 3,
the calibration is repeated using the new gains; the procedure converges after
a small number of iterations.

A consistency check between the calibration and magnetic ﬁeld map was also

26

performed. If the calorimeter calibrations are well understood, each event per-
mits an evaluation of both the event yγ and the value of the integrated mag-
netic ﬁeld traversed by the pair. We deﬁne ∆ R Bdz as the integrated ﬁeld
measured from the electron energies and positions minus the value known
from the measured magnetic ﬁeld map. The distribution in ∆ R Bdz for typi-
cal operating conditions is shown (data points) in Fig 21, and the histogram is
predicted by the Monte Carlo simulation. The RMS width is about 10% of the
0.32 Tm, which is consistent with the individual electron en-
typical R Bdz
ergy resolution described in Sec. 2. The asymmetric tail to negative ∆ R Bdz
is attributed to the small number (
1%) of photons converting inside the
magnet aperture in comparison to those converting in the exit window.

The overconstraints in the reconstruction were very important and used fre-
quently, particularly during early operations when severe background condi-
tions caused some deterioration of calorimeter response because of radiation
damage to the calorimeter WLSs. This issue will be discussed later in this
section.

One additional independent check of the energy scale was performed — a test
against the known circulating electron beam energy. By increasing the dipole
magnetic ﬁeld and acquiring data, a value was empirically determined for the
end point of the bremsstrahlung spectrum with our calibrations of calorimeter
and magnet. The data for one such run, after correction for acceptance, are
shown in Fig. 22. The curve shows the Bethe-Heitler spectrum, multiplied
by the photon energy, in the vicinity of the end point. The points show the
data, corrected for acceptance. The shaded histogram shows the predicted
spectrum for this quantity from the Monte Carlo, with energy adjusted to
best ﬁt the observed data. The adjusted energy is within 1% of the expected
value, 27.6 GeV, which is the known energy of the electron beam.

5.3 Radiation Complications

Under operating conditions, the most severe unanticipated complications arose
due to severe radiation backgrounds in the region of the calorimeters. During
beam tuning, and even during stable operations, the synchrotron radiation in
the region of the calorimeters was high, particularly in the scintillator strips
near the beamline. The wavelength-shifting light guides in the regions of the
PMTs were particularly susceptible to radiation damage. Under severe condi-
tions, the calibrations of some channels would change, and then would later
recover during periods when the beam was absent. These eﬀects were discov-
ered because of the available overconstraints that permitted in situ calibra-
tions. Corrections for the radiation damage maintained the scale within 5%
of the nominal, and was understood well enough to correct for small trigger-
ing threshold eﬀects. Hence, the issue was managed by performing periodic
calibrations and utilizing these to make appropriate corrections.

After diagnosis, the operational eﬀects of the radiation ﬁeld were reduced by
making physical modiﬁcations during shutdowns. Additional, well-designed
shielding was installed in the aﬀected regions. In the process, radiation moni-
tors were also installed in order to monitor the severity of the radiation back-
grounds and to identify the regions of damage. Such monitors proved to be
important because seemingly small changes in beam conﬁgurations could re-
sult in substantially diﬀerent radiation ﬁelds at the detector. Large changes
in beam conditions, like switching from circulating positron beam to electron
beam, produced even larger eﬀects. Figure 23 provides a typical example of
data taken with four diﬀerent radiation monitors versus time. In these ﬁgures,
the electron beam reaches full energy at 9.0 hours, and the collimator blocking
the bremsstrahlung (and synchrotron) beam was inserted at 10.7 hours, then

28

removed at 11.2 hours. The presence of the large radiation ﬁeld is clearly seen
to originate from the beamline.

gain drifts because of radiation damage contributed a 2
on the acceptance calculation because of good events not ﬁring the hardware
trigger, as estimated by Monte Carlo simulation. Another problem associated
with channel gain drifts is the y position measurement of the photon, which
is related to the energy measurement of each calorimeter as shown in Eqn. 7.
Subsequently, the error in the acceptance calculation was reduced to a negli-
gible level by employing frequent software calibrations.

5.4 Bremsstrahlung and Pair Production Measurements

Good bremsstrahlung photons are selected from electron-positron coincidences
at the two calorimeters in a two-step process. The ﬁrst stage, employed by the
hardware trigger, requires both calorimeters to have energy deposits exceeding
a certain threshold, as mentioned in Sec. 2.5. The small threshold value is
chosen to distinguish real electrons from electronic noise. According to the
geometry setup of the system, the energy spectrum for electrons from pair
production of the bremsstrahlung photon begins to rise from zero around
6 GeV, while the total noise level for the calorimeters is lower than 1 GeV
under normal running circumstances. However, since the calibration constants

29

are only applied later in software, the rising edge of a good electron spectrum
can have tails, and depends on the hit position because some channels are
more radiation exposed than others. Cutting out the tail with the hardware
trigger would add error to the luminosity calculation. The tails were minimized
by periodic high-voltage trimming of the detectors, and by choosing a small
hardware threshold which is far away from the noise level.

For events with signals from both detectors accepted by the hardware trigger,
a software selection including the following requirements is applied to both
detectors:

•

•

•

the reconstructed energy for each detector must be larger than 3.5 GeV,
which guarantees the coincidence requirement;
the standard deviation of shower strip positions (obtained using an algo-
rithm with linear energy weighting) must be less than 1.0 cm, distinguishing
electromagnetic showers from hadronic showers;
the largest energy depositions in both x and y directions are not at the edge
strips, guaranteeing good energy and position reconstruction.

Also, a requirement on the reconstructed y position in the down detector elec-
tron is imposed to make sure the ﬁducial regions for up and down detectors are
symmetrical with respect to the y position deﬁned by the moving collimator.

The coincidence selection requirements lower the background to a negligible
level. With the good bremsstrahlung photons selected, the photon physics
quantities (energy, x and y positions) can be reconstructed as described in
Sec. 3.2. Below we show some of the important physics quantities compared
with Monte Carlo predictions.

As described in Sec. 4, one critical underlying physics process for the lumi-
nosity measurement involves the z-distribution reﬂecting the energy sharing
in the pair production process, shown in Fig. 11. We show in Fig. 24 the
reconstructed spectrum under typical running conditions compared with the
Monte Carlo simulation (histogram) incorporating the acceptance, resolutions,
and calibrations. The good agreement indicates that measurements are well
understood and simulated properly.

A second critical process is the bremsstrahlung creation, whose cross section
is shown in Fig. 10. The distribution of observed photon energies, shown in
Fig. 25, is compared with the Monte Carlo simulation. Again, the agreement
is good and illustrates that the instrument is well understood. Note that the
acceptance is zero at the low values of Eγ and at both low and high values of z,
3.5 GeV (corresponding to, for example,
so that electrons of low energy Ee ∼
z = 0.3 and Eγ = 12 GeV) have very low acceptance by virtue of geometry
and the magnetic ﬁeld. In other words, for both Eγ and z to be observed with
small values, the beam y position must be oﬀ center by a large amount, and

5.5 Measurements of Luminosity

The integrated luminosity is calculated based on the number of good bremsstrahlung
photons selected as described in Sec. 5.4. Two important issues in this calcu-
lation need to be addressed: deadtime and acceptance.

∼

2 GeV at both detectors and the prescale set to 1,
For the trigger setting of
the DAQ system deadtime ranged from about 80% at the start of a HERA ﬁll
to 20% at the end. With the typical operating prescale at 3, the deadtime was
reduced by more than a factor of two at the start of ﬁll and usually dropped
to essentially zero later in the ﬁll. Diﬀerences between results from the two
methods of deadtime estimation mentioned in Sec. 2.5 were smaller than one
percent in most cases, and consistent with statistical ﬂuctuations.

31

The typical data rate under the current trigger setting and prescale factor
3 is around 3 kHz. After software selections the data rate drops by about a
factor of 2. Still, it is neither feasible nor necessary to retain an individual
data record for every good bremsstrahlung photon. The following data are
saved every 16 seconds for both the oﬄine luminosity calculation and beam
monitoring purposes:

histograms for x, y positions and energy of the bremsstrahlung photons;
counters for coincidences in each HERA bunch;
counters for total HERA bunches during the period;
counters for HERA bunches when the DAQ system buﬀer is not full (actively
receiving data);
correlator between x, y position of bremsstrahlung photons, < xγyγ >.

A Geant 3.21 simulation of the entire spectrometer system is used in the oﬄine
acceptance calculation. This simulation incorporates the measured aperture,
exit window, dipole and detectors. Additional conversions in air are simulated,
as is scattering of the e± in the window and air.

First, the beam ellipse tilt is calculated using the moments of the xγ and yγ
histograms and the correlator < xγyγ >. Using this tilt, a sample of simulated
events is reweighted and ﬁt to the xγ and yγ histograms. The result of this ﬁt
are the photon beam horizontal and vertical mean positions and RMS spreads,
along with the acceptance corrected number of bremsstrahlung events. This
acceptance corrected number of events is then used to calculate the luminosity
using the known bremsstrahlung cross section. An example of the output of
the ﬁt was shown in Figs. 19 and 20. Note the high statistics accumulated in
the 16 second integration period. The Eγ histogram, in Fig. 25, agrees well
with the Monte Carlo prediction without any additional parameters.

Some small additional corrections must be applied to obtain the ﬁnal lumi-
nosity, such as good coincidences not ﬁring the hardware trigger before the
trigger threshold was lowered. The trigger is simulated by shifting the gain of
each channel in Monte Carlo by the amount observed in the most recent cali-
bration. This is typically a 2
3% correction. Another concern caused by the
gain drifts from radiation are systematic shifts in the y position of the photon.
This was tested by Monte Carlo with the maximum observed gain drifts. The
eﬀect is found to be at most a few per cent and completely negligible when
frequent calibrations are being carried out. During normal running conditions,
a calibration is done at the end of each ﬁll of HERA.

The calculated luminosities for a typical 8-hour run are shown in Fig. 26. The
lower curve, with values shown on the left hand axis, is the instantaneous
luminosity reported by the monitor. The decrease in luminosity during the
period is primarily attributable to the decrease in electron beam current over

32

the period. The upper curve in the ﬁgure, with values shown on the axis to
the right, is the instantaneous speciﬁc luminosity, obtained by dividing by the
sum of the product of proton and electron bunch currents as in Eqn. 9. Note
that the instantaneous speciﬁc luminosity decreases much more slowly, which
is due to the increase of the proton beam emittance.

histogram shows the speciﬁc luminosity (right scale), during a typical beam ﬁll. Note
that the luminosity decrease during the ﬁll primarily arises from loss of electron
current.

5.6 Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties from various sources are given in Tab. 5.6.

The shape of the aperture and its alignment relative to the detectors were
each measured to an accuracy of 1 mm. The eﬀects of gain drifts could cause
a shift in yγ measurement of 2 mm. To check the eﬀect on the acceptance,
a Monte Carlo simulation of the photon beam was moved by these amounts.
The overall uncertainty on the acceptance from these eﬀects is 2.5%, as given
in the ﬁrst row of the table.

The acceptance is directly proportional to the fraction of photons converted in
the exit window (a very small faction from the air also). Uncertainties on the
cross section for conversion, material in the window, and the window thickness
lead to an uncertainty on the acceptance of 2%, shown in the next row.

Estimated systematic errors associated with the issues creating the largest eﬀects.

Several other eﬀects were considered and estimated to be < 0.5%. These in-
clude pile-up of bremsstrahlung photons, deadtime measurement, knowledge of
the dipole ﬁeld, trigger threshold correction, and the theoretical Bethe-Heitler
cross section.

For the early operations, uncertainties in the acceptance, window conversions,
and other issues resulted in an overall 3.5% estimated error in the luminosity
determination. With time and experience, this error will decrease. The most
important step in achieving this will be the direct and empirical determination
of the acceptance and conversion fraction, using the 6 meter tagger located
near the IP. This device collects an unbiased sample of recoil bremsstrahlung
electrons, with companion photon energies within the acceptance of the lumi-
nosity spectrometer. For such tagger events, the fraction with detected photons
constitutes a direct measure of the product f A in Eqn. 10. After appropri-
ate experience and experimentation, we anticipate the ultimate uncertainty in
luminosity measurement to be about 2%.

6 Summary

In summary, the luminosity spectrometer has been successfully brought into
operation. The device has been used to measure luminosity for the 2004 data
collection by ZEUS with an estimated error of 3.5%. Operations were largely
as anticipated. The only major obstacle was the very intense synchrotron ra-
diation ﬁeld in the region of the calorimeters. This radiation compromised
somewhat the operations of the wavelength-shifting readout of the calorime-
ter scintillators. With recent and ongoing shielding improvements, along with
direct measurements of the product of the photon conversion fraction and

34

acceptance, we anticipate achieving luminosity measurements with about 2%
uncertainty with the luminosity spectrometer system.

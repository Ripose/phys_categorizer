Abstract

The CMS experiment will include a pixel detector for pattern recognition and vertexing. It will consist of three
barrel layers and two endcaps on each side, providing three space-points up to a pseudoraditity of 2.1. Taking into
account the expected limitations of its performance in the LHC environment an 8-9 layer pixel detector for an
upgraded LHC is discussed.

Key words: LHC, super LHC, CMS, tracking, pixel, silicon, radiation hardness

1. Introduction

The tracker of the CMS-experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) will be equipped with a
pixel detector [1] providing three precision space
points up to a pseudorapidity of 2.1. These un-
ambiguous space points allow an eﬀective pattern
recognition in the multiple track environment close
to the LHC interaction point. Further the precision
of the measurement is used to identify displaced
vertices for the tagging of b-jets and τ -leptons.

In its ﬁnal conﬁguration the pixel detector will
consist of three barrel layers and two end disks at
each side. The barrels will be 53 cm long and placed
at radii of 4.4 cm, 7.3 cm, and 10.2 cm. They cover
an area of about 0.8 m2 with roughly 800 modules.
The end disks are located at a mean distance from
the interaction point of 34.5 cm and 46.5 cm. The
area of the 96 turbine blade shaped modules in the
disks sums up to about 0.28 m2.

To achieve the necessary spatial resolution, ana-
logue interpolation between neighbouring channels

in the radial direction caused by CMS’ 4 T mag-
netic ﬁeld distributes the signal over several pixels.

The two main challenges for the design of the
pixel detector are the high track rate and the high
level of radiation. The former concerns the archi-
tecture of the readout electronics. For the 4 cm
layer it has to locally store the hit information of
106 tracks per second and cm2 at full

LHC luminosity for the latency of the 1st level trig-
ger (3.2 m s). The high radiation level mainly af-
fects the charge collection properties of the sen-
sor, which degrades steadily. In order to preserve
a spatial resolution of better than 20 m m, which is
required for eﬃcient b-tagging, the pixel modules

jor upgrade of the tracker. The granularity of the
strip detectors will become insuﬃcient and these
detectors will have to be replaced by pixel devices
up to a radius of about 60 cm. As the area to be
covered by such a system is in the order of 10 m2,
the choice of the detector concept will be governed
by ﬁnancial considerations. Ideas for such cost ef-
fective pixel detectors are given in section 3 and 4.
The inner regions of the tracker will have to face
an unprecedented track rate and radiation level as
shown in Fig. 1. The detectors placed at a radius
of 4 cm have to withstand the presently unreached
1016 neq/cm2 or must be re-
particle ﬂuence of Φ
placed frequently. The operation limit of a present
type hybrid pixel system is discussed in section 2.
This is used as a starting point for a proposal of an
8-9 layer pixel system for an upgraded CMS pixel
tracker.

2. Limitations of a present-Type Pixel
Detector at an upgraded LHC

The limiting factors for the operation of a hybrid
pixel system at an upgraded LHC remain the same
as for the design of the initial CMS pixel detector:
the track rate for the readout electronics and the
radiation induced degradation for the sensors.

2

2.1. Sensor

Since the late 1980’s the radiation induced
degradation of silicon detectors has been systemat-
ically studied. The main eﬀects are the increase of
the leakage current, trapping and the space charge.
While the space charge increase is reduced for sili-
con containing a high concentration of oxygen [3],
no dependence on the starting material could be
found for the other two parameters. Assuming that
the increased leakage current can be controlled by
cooling, the reduction of the signal by charge trap-
ping presently sets the ultimate limit of the use of
silicon detectors.

Trapping of the signal charge is caused by irra-
diation induced energy levels in the band gap. It
can be described by the trapping time which is in-
versely proportional to particle ﬂuence. This is il-
lustrated in Fig. 2 were the signal degradation in a
285 m m thick pixel detector with increasing parti-
cle ﬂuence is shown. In this measurement the bias
voltage was adjusted for each ﬂuence to values be-
tween 100 V and 600 V [4]. A further increase will
not increase the signal level considerably. Up to a
1015 neq/cm2 a total signal above
ﬂuence of Φ
12 000 electrons originating from the whole detec-
tor thickness [5] is achieved which is suﬃcient for an
eﬃcient particle detection at comparator thresh-
olds of 2000-3000 electrons.

≈

At higher ﬂuences the signal steadily decreases
further. It is not straightforward to decide which
signal level will be suﬃcient for eﬃcient tracking.

3

×

If it is possible to operate with a signal of 6000
1015 neq/cm2 will be
electrons, a ﬂuence of Φ
≈
reachable. Tests with pixel detectors irradiated to
this level have been performed and show encour-
aging results [4]. This corresponds to the radiation
level at a radius of 8 cm, leaving only the radiation
hardness of the innermost (4 cm) layer unsolved.
Strategies to reach the level of radiation hardness
required there are the subject of the CERN-RD50
collaboration [6]. When a pixel detector is oper-
ated at such a high ﬂuence, charge sharing will be
much reduced due to the decreasing Lorentz an-
gle and the diminished range of signal collection
depth. This will eventually limit the spatial reso-
lution to the binary resolution of pitch/√12. If the
value of better than 20 m m has to be achieved also
at ﬂuences above 1015 neq/cm2, the pixel pitch has
to be reduced which requires a redesign of the read-
out chip. In this case it has also to be reconsidered,
whether the analogue signal processing performed
by the present CMS pixel readout chip is still use-
ful.

2.2. Readout Chip

The radiation hardness of ASICs fabricated in
0.25 m m technology seems to be suﬃcient up to
ionisation doses 2 exceeding 250 kGy. The perfor-
mance of the readout chip is therefore limited by
the readout losses due to the high rate of tracks.
As one would like to avoid a complete redesign of
the present CMS pixel chip, the limits of its archi-
tecture will be discussed in section 2.2.2, after the
main mechanisms for data loss has been explained
in the next paragraph.

2.2.1. Architecture and Readout Losses of the
CMS Pixel Readout Chip

The architecture of the readout chip was ad-
justed to the environment of the LHC and is de-
scribed in detail in [7]. Here only the features nec-

2 The tolerance against charged particles at this high level
has still to be checked. A reduction of the charge carrier
mobility might lead to speed limitations and the increase
of the junction leakage current could discharge dynamic
nodes and lead to an increased standby power.

essary to understand the ineﬃciency mechanisms
are discussed.

Each pixel contains a preampliﬁer, shaper and
comparator. When the amplitude of the shaper ex-
ceeds the comparator threshold, the periphery of
the chip, which is shared by two columns of pixels,
is notiﬁed and the amplitude is stored in a sample-
and-hold capacitor. The double column periphery
then creates a time stamp and initiates a scan (“col-
umn drain”) which copies the amplitude of all hit
pixels into the data buﬀers. After the trigger la-
tency the buﬀers are either deleted or read out. In
case of a trigger conﬁrmation the double column is
reset after the readout. During all these operations
data can be lost as studied in detail with Monte-
Carlo simulations [8]. The numbers given here are
the expected ineﬃciencies for the 4 cm layer at full
LHC luminosity.

If the pixel is hit twice before the charge is trans-
ferred to the data buﬀer the second hit is lost
(“pixel busy”). Due to the fast draining mecha-
nism and the low pixel occupancy such events are
unlikely (0.21 %).

During the column drain the pixels in the same
double column are still sensitive through a “stack”
mechanism. However, this stack is limited to two
further events in the double column. The proba-
bility that a fourth event occurs is 0.25 % (“double
column busy”).

The number of time stamp (12) and data (32)
buﬀers was adjusted to the data rate in the 4 cm
layer and the buﬀer overﬂow rate is low (each
0.17 %).

The dominant source of data loss is caused by
the reset of the double column after each triggered
readout (“reset loss”). Any double column can only
handle one triggered event at a time. Therefore this
ineﬃciency depends on the rate of the level 1 trig-
ger (3.0 % at 100 kHz).

All these ineﬃciencies add up to 3.8 % for the

4 cm layer and about 1 % for the larger radii.

The ineﬃciency of the readout chip as a func-
tion of the track rate has been measured in a test-
beam experiment as shown in Fig. 3 [7]. As the
conditions there are slightly diﬀerent from the ﬁ-
nal situation in CMS (impact angle is 90◦ and par-
ticles are uncorrelated) it is diﬃcult to relate this
results to the LHC like conditions. However, the

measured losses approximately agree with the sim-
ulations explained above.

2.2.2. Performance of the Present Readout
Architecture at an upgraded LHC

With a further increase of the track rate when
the luminosity is upgraded, the readout losses will
also increase. As not all inceﬃciency mechanisms
have the same rate dependence, a Monte-Carlo
simulation was used to estimate the readout losses
at a luminosity of 1035 cm−2s−1. To keep the time
stamp buﬀer losses below 1 % the number of time
stamps has to be increased from 12 to about 60. A
similar scaling applies to the data buﬀers. The use
of a very compact 0.13 m m technology would cer-
tainly help to limit the increase of the peripheral
chip area.

The dependency of the three remaining data loss
mechanisms on the distance from the interaction
point is shown in Fig. 4. With increasing particle
rate (or decreasing radius) the probability of a dou-
ble column to be hit more than three times during
the time of a column drain increases dramatically.
This limits the use of the present CMS-pixel read-
out at the tenfold LHC-luminosity to radii above
10 cm. For smaller radii a more elaborate redesign
of the chip is necessary.

The reset loss mostly depends on the trigger la-
tency and rate which are assumed to stay constant.
The rise with decreasing radius can be explained by

the longer time necessary to read out the increased
number of hits per triggered event. The pixels are
still small enough such that the probability to be
hit twice within a short time (pixel busy) remains
relatively low.

2.3. Cost Considerations

A rough cost estimate for a CMS pixel barrel
module is given in Tab. 1. All the components
added up lead to a price of about 400 CHF/cm2.
If this technology is found to be the only possible
one at ﬂuences above 1015 neq/cm2, a conﬁgura-
tion of three pixel layers at radii of 8, 11 and 14 cm
is conceivable. They would add up to a total area
of about 1.1 m2, assuming a 53 cm long barrel.

3. Pixel Detectors at intermediate Radii

At radii larger than 15 cm neither the track rate
nor the radiation hardness represents a major limit
for pixel detectors. As the area to be covered in-
creases with the radius, cost issues become more
important. The most eﬀective items for a possi-
ble reduction are bump bonding and sensors (see
Tab. 1).

−

The most cost driving requirement of the sen-
sor’s n-in-n technology is the need of double sided
processing. As the radiation hardness required at
radii between 15 and 25 cm is still in the range of
1014 neq/cm2, the collection of electrons
5
is more favourable. This naturally leads to n-in-
p sensors, an option currently investigated by the
RD50 collaboration [6]. This technology might be
available on 150 mm wafers oﬀering the chance of
80 mm2) per
getting three large modules (e.g. 32
wafer.

×

×

The disadvantage of the single sided process is
that due to the absence of the guard rings on the
back side, all sensor edges are at the potential
of the applied bias voltage. As a consequence of
the considerable radiation damage, high voltages
(400-600 V) will be required to obtain a close to
complete charge collection. Precautions to protect
the readout electronics from destructive discharges
will have to be taken, like e.g. the introduction of a
thin capton ﬁlm between readout chips and sensor
edge.

Bumpbonding is in principle well established
and widely used in industry. The cost driving re-
quirement of particle physics is the small pitch be-
low 100 m m. If this number is relaxed to a value
above 250 m m, a wide range of cheap industrial
packageing processes will become available (e.g.
the IBM-C4 process [9]). The track density in
this area will allow pixel areas of the order of
100 000 m m2. In addition the number of chip place-
ments can be reduced by increasing the size of the
readout chip to the largest practical dimensions
(e.g. 16

20 mm2).

Some of the measures proposed above are al-
ready realised in the construction of the PILATUS-
1M pixel detector [10]. From the experience of this
project it seems possible to reduce the cost of such

×

a pixel detector to roughly 100 CHF/cm2. If this
is achieved it will be possible to equip two layers,
e.g. at 18 and 22 cm, with such detectors.

4. Pixel Detectors at Larger Radii

For the radial region between 25 and 60 cm an
even more drastic cost reduction of pixel detectors
is necessary which can only be reached if the full
coverage of the active area with readout electronics
is given up. This is possible because the suitable
size of a sensing element is a few square millimetres
while a readout channel can be integrated into an
area of about 0.02 mm2.

×

The shape of a sensing element (“mini strip” or
5000 m m2 leading
“macro pixel”) could be 200
to about 10 000 channels per sensor. They could
be read out by a small number of pixel chips with
a much smaller cell size. The routing between the
sensor cells and the inputs of the readout chips
could be performed via a thick (about 40 m m) poly-
imide layer. An alternative would be the MCM-
D technique [11] which in addition allows the in-
tegration of other components on a module. As
the readout chips can be placed completely in-
side the active area of the sensor the sensor edges
need not be kept on ground potential and a single
sided sensor would be possible. Due to the moder-
ate requirements in radiation hardness in this area
1014 neq/cm2) “traditional” and cheaply
(Φ < 5
available DC-coupled p-in-n sensors can be used.
It might be possible to build such a detector for
about 50 CHF/cm2. They are a good candidate for
layers at radii of e.g. 30, 40 and 50 cm.

×

5. Conclusions

The main tasks of the CMS pixel detector are
the measurement of displaced vertices and pattern
recognition. The challenges in the hostile environ-
ment of LHC are the high level of radiation and
the high rate of tracks. The requirements in par-
ticle detection eﬃciency and spatial resolution in
CMS can be satisﬁed, however sometimes with lit-
tle headroom.

al., Studies

In case of an LHC luminosity upgrade the in-
crease of the track density will require the exten-
sion of pixel detectors to larger radii. Large areas,
however, can only be equipped with pixel detectors
whose cost is considerably reduced. A pixel system
of 9 layers seems quite feasible:
Innermost layer: The requirements of the inner-
most pixel layer (roughly 4 cm) cannot be full-
ﬁlled with present technologies. Possible solu-
tions are investigated by the RD50 collabora-
tion. In addition the readout electronics for this
environment has to be developed soon.

Small radii: The region starting from 8 cm can
probably be equipped with present pixel mod-
ules with moderately modiﬁed readout chips.
However, only binary spatial resolution can be
reached.

Intermediate radii: For radii between 15 and
25 cm a less expensive pixel system with sin-
gle sided sensors and industrial bumpbonding is
proposed.

Large radii: Radii between 30 and 60 cm could
be equipped with macropixels or ministrips.
If it is possbile to reach the targeted cost reduc-
tion such pixel systems will be very attractive for
many other applications.

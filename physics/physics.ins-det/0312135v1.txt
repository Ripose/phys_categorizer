Abstract— DEPFET pixel detectors are unique devices in terms
of energy and spatial resolution because very low noise (ENC
= 2.2e at room temperature) operation can be obtained by
itself.
implementing the amplifying transistor in the pixel cell
Full DEPFET pixel matrices have been built and operated for
autoradiographical imaging with imaging resolutions of 4.3±0.8
µm at 22 keV. For applications in low energy X-ray astronomy
the high energy resolution of DEPFET detectors is attractive. For
particle physics, DEPFET pixels are interesting as low material
detectors with high spatial resolution. For a Linear Collider
detector the readout must be very fast. New readout chips have
been designed and produced for the development of a DEPFET
module for a pixel detector at the proposed TESLA collider
(520x4000 pixels) with 50 MHz line rate and 25 kHz frame
rate. The circuitry contains current memory cells and current
hit scanners for fast pedestal subtraction and sparsiﬁed readout.
The imaging performance of DEPFET devices as well as present
achievements towards a DEPFET vertex detector for a Linear
Collider are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

For a Linear Collider Detector [1] efﬁcient and good ﬂavor
identiﬁcation and separation is required for the accurate deter-
mination of Higgs branching ratios and other physics processes
beyond the Standard Model. However, due to the very promi-
nent beamstrahlung near the interaction point, the background
conditions and the time structure of the accelerator are ﬁerce
leading to detector occupancies of 80 hits / mm2 / bunch train
(∼ 1ms) for a typical pixel detector situated at a radius of
15 mm away from the beam line. DEPFET pixel detectors
have shown to be capable of simultaneously providing excellent
energy and spatial resolution which can be exploited for various
applications: imaging in biomedical autoradiography [2], [3],

[5], [6], [7], [8] and particle detection at a future Linear Collider
[9], [10], [11]. In this paper we present the achievements
obtained to date in imaging and spectroscopy with DEPFET
pixel devices and describe the developments for a micro vertex
detector based on DEPFET pixels for a Linear Collider. The
DEPFET developments for the XEUS project are presented by
L. Str¨uder [8] at this conference.

II. THE DEPFET PRINCIPLE AND OPERATION

The DEPleted Field Effect Transistor structure [12], abbrevi-
ated DEPFET, provides detection and ampliﬁcation properties
jointly. The principle of operation is shown in ﬁg. 1. A MOS
or junction ﬁeld effect transistor is integrated onto a detector
substrate. By means of sidewards depletion [14], appropriate
bulk, source and drain potentials, and an additional deep-n-
implantion a potential minimum for electrons is created right
underneath the transistor channel (∼ 1 µm below the surface).
This can be regarded as an internal gate of the transistor. A
particle entering the detector creates electron-hole pairs in the
fully depleted silicon substrate. While the holes drift into the
rear contact of the detector, the electrons are collected in the
internal gate where they are stored. The signal charge leads to
a change in the potential of the internal gate, resulting in a
modulation of the channel current of the transistor.

The simultaneous detection and ampliﬁcation feature makes
DEPFET pixel detectors very attractive for low noise imag-
ing [3], [15]. For particle detection the use of very thin
(∼ 50 µm) detectors operated with very low power consump-
tion should be possible. The low noise operation is obtained
because the capacitance of the internal gate can be made
very small (several 10 fF), much smaller than the cell area
suggests. Furthermore, no external connection circuitry to the
ﬁrst ampliﬁcation stage is needed. External ampliﬁcation enters
only at the second level stage. This leads to an excellent noise

performance already at room temperature. The pixel delivers
a current signal which is roughly proportional to the number
of collected electrons in the internal gate. Signal electrons as
well as electrons accumulated from bulk leakage current must
be removed from the internal gate after readout. Clearing is
obtained by periodically applying a positive voltage pulse to a
clear contact. Other clear mechanisms have also been studied
[4]. The question, whether the internal gate is completely emp-
tied from electrons upon a CLEAR pulse (complete CLEAR)
is an important one, both for very low noise operation in X-ray
astronomy with XEUS and for fast pedestal subtraction in a LC
detector. With complete clearing the statistical ﬂuctuations in
the number of electrons in the internal gate as well as switching
noise (kT/C noise) are absent.

to MTF30% values of 37 lp/mm and 57 lp/mm, respectively
[4]. The corresponding width of the point spread function for
Tritium imaging derived from these measurements is ∼7µm.

development for autoradiography, we are presently developing
DEPFET pixels for imaging with the X-ray telescope of the
planned XEUS satellite of the European Space Agency ESA
[8], [16], and for a particle micro vertex tracker for a future
Linear Collider like TESLA [1], [9]. While for XEUS very
good energy resolution (ENC < 4e) at relaxed frame times (1.2
ms) is required, at TESLA frame times of 50µs for 520x4000
pixels and 50µm thin detectors are needed.

A DEPFET matrix is operated as shown in ﬁg. 2. Rows are
selected by applying a voltage to the external gate of a row.
Drains are connected column-wise. The drain current of each
pixel in a selected row is detected and ampliﬁed in a dedicated
ampliﬁcation circuit. Pedestals are taken at the beginning of an
exposure cycle and subtracted off-line. Finally, clear pulses are
applied to the clear contacts to empty the internal gates. On
the right of ﬁg. 2 a photograph of a DEPFET-Matrix hybrid
assembly as used for imaging is shown. Both, gate-on/off and
CLEAR pulses are issued from the sequencer chip on the right.

III. PERFORMANCE OF DEPFET SINGLE PIXELS AND
MATRICES

Figure 3 summarizes the performance ﬁgures obtained with
DEPFET single pixels and with a 64x64 DEPFET matrix,
respectively. Fig. 3(a) shows the measured energy spectrum
obtained with a single DEPFET pixel structure at room temper-
ature. Using circular structures of a recent production energy
resolutions of 131 eV at 6 keV (55Fe, Kα peak) have been
measured, originating from a Fano noise contribution of 14e
and a DEPFET noise contribution of 2.2e. Figure 3(b) displays
the image of precision slits in a tungsten test chart, the smallest
of which are 25µm wide at 50µm pitch. The projection of the
image is shown below in ﬁg. 3(b). An evaluation of the mea-
sured structure results in a width of the point spread function
of σ = 6.7 ± 0.7 µm using an 55Fe (6 keV) X-ray source and σ

IV. DEVELOPMENTS FOR A VERTEX DETECTOR FOR
TESLA

For a pixel detector at TESLA, DEPFET pixels can offer
• 50µm thin detectors with S/N values still in excess of ∼50.
• A total material budget (sensor, chips and frame) of
in a perforated

0.11%X0: The 50µm thin sensors sit
300µm silicon frame (see section IV-B).

• A cell size of 25x25µm2 or similar.
• A fast readout with 50 MHz line rate and 25 kHz frame

rate for 520x4000 pixels per module

• Low power consumption of <5W for the entire detector

with 5 barrel layers as proposed for TESLA [1].

A. New DEPFET Sensors

Based upon the encouraging performance of DEPFET single
structures and large matrices, new DEPFET structures tailored
to the needs of the XEUS (75µm diameter circular structures)
and TESLA (small 20×25µm2 linear structures) projects have
been fabricated at the MPI Semiconductor Laboratory in Mu-
nich using a design with 2-metal layers. Among the main design
goals were

• smaller pixels by a factor of 2 in both linear dimensions:
This enforced the change from closed circular JFET
geometries, used so far, to linear MOSFET structures,
for which smaller devices with better homogeneity and
reproducibility over a large area can be made with the
existing technology. In order to reduce the size further
cells containing two pixels with a common clear structure,
a common source and two drain contacts have been
produced (see ﬁg. 4). One row addresses always a pair of
pixels with the drains connected to two separate column
like output busses.

• One of the main drawbacks of the previous structures was
the uncomplete clearing of the internal gate, limiting the
ability to obtain the achieved single pixel noise ﬁgures
below 5e also in large matrices. While complete clearing
of the internal gate is mandatory for low energy X-ray
imaging with XEUS, it is also necessary for operation
with TESLA speeds, because here signal and pedestal
currents are on-chip subtracted with a CLEAR pulse being
applied between subsequent signal and pedestal samplings
(c.f. section IV-C. In order to facilitate this operation a
ClearGate structure has been added around the entire pixel
cell, which is activated shortly (∼ 10 ns) after the CLEAR
pulse. A ClearGate structure with the required dimensions
is very difﬁcult to fabricate with a JFET realization of the
DEPFET transistor.

Simulations have conﬁrmed that no potential pockets, which
can trap signal charges during charge collection and clearing,
are present in the design.

The smallest structures of the present production are about
20x30 µm2. First measurements on single structures using
an 55Fe X-ray source have conﬁrmed the excellent noise
performance of previous structures. With the low noise circular

structures designed for the XEUS project, an ENC of 2.2 e−
and 131 eV FWHM for the Kα line have been measured at
room temperature. The charge to current ampliﬁcation has been
measured to be ∼400pA/e− on the ﬁrst structures which have
been evaluated. Figure 5 indicates that complete clearing has
been achieved. Shown is the width of the noise peak obtained
by measuring the DC DEPFET drain current using two very
different R/O operations: (a) one CLEAR and then taking 500
R/O samples, (b) taking 500 x (CLEAR + R/O) samples. If
the clearing is complete the widths of the noise peaks in both
cases should be the same. This is the case for sufﬁciently large
CLEAR pulses with sufﬁcient duration time (e.g. > 14V, >
100 ns pulse width).

Very ﬁrst studies on DEPFET matrices indicate DEPFET
current dispersions of about 7.5% over a 16×128 pixel matrix
operated without clearing. The space resolution has not yet been
measured in test beams yet. Extrapolating from measurements
with previous DEPFET pixel matrices with cell dimensions
of 50µm×50µm we expect space resolutions for minimum
ionizing particles with these new sensors in the order of 2-
4µm, depending on the charge sharing between pixels.

B. Wafer thinning technology

Thinning of DEPFET wafers using anisotropic etching has
been developed successfully in collaboration with the MPI f¨ur
Mikrostrukturphysik in Halle/Germany [17]. The processing
steps using bonding of a handle wafer are shown in ﬁg. 6. A thin
50µm structure which is stiffened by a frame of thicker silicon
(∼ 350µm) is obtained. The detector remains sensitive also in
these thicker frame regions. Active Si diodes have been thinned
this way with very satisfactory results and leakage currents
less than 1 nA/cm2 [17] have been measured. A photograph
of thinned passive, module sized samples is presented in ﬁg. 7.

C. Readout chips for DEPFET modules at a LC

The readout principle for a DEPFET matrix of ﬁg. 2 is
unchanged for a much faster operation at a Linear Collider.

However, a module of 520x4000 pixels is read out column-
wise to both top and bottom sides at a continuous line rate
of up to 50 MHz (40µs frame time) in the innermost layer,
taking 25 frames per train crossing time (∼ 1 ms). Both, the
row addressing sequencer chip SWITCHER for (external) gate
on/off and (internal gate) clear and the column-based current
readout chip (CURO) for ampliﬁcation and sparsiﬁed current
readout must comply to this rate. During one line cycle (20 ns),
sampling of signal+pedestal, CLEAR, and sampling of pedestal
is required.

The block diagram of the readout chip CURO is shown
in ﬁg. 8. A cascode stage at the input of the readout chip
keeps the drain lines at a constant potential, such that the
DEPFET current does not need to charge the relatively large
bus capacitance. A row is selected for readout after the charge
accumulation interval. The selected DEPFET transistors output
a signal current superimposed to a pedestal current. This current
Iped + Isig is stored in a current memory cell for every column.
After a complete CLEAR of the row, and assuming negligible
leakage currents during the time between two sample cycles (10
ns), the pedestal current Iped is measured by a second sampling
cycle in the selected row. The pedestal subtracted signal is
then obtained by summing the stored (negative) signal+pedestal
current with the pedestal current. The signal current −Isig is
stored in an analog FIFO of several current memory cells.
A fast current comparison with a programmable hit threshold
generates a digital hit pattern which is simultaneously recorded
in a digital FIFO. Analog FIFO cells with no hits can be
switched off to save power. While the analog FIFOs are ﬁlled
with events containing at least one hit, a fast scanner searches
for hits in the digital FIFO. The corresponding analog values
are selected with a multiplexer and fed to one or several ADCs.
Crucial elements of this design are the current memory cell,
the hit scanner, and the current comparator. They have all been
tested using a test chip fabrication. The current memory cell
(ﬁg. 9) is adopted using the switched current technique [18]. A
current is stored in three phases:

linearity of 0.1% over a sufﬁciently large dynamic range of 10
µA corresponding to several mips. At the cost of linearity the
total dynamic range can be as large as 100µA, corresponding
to the charge of 20 mips or more, depending on the gq of the
DEPFET transistor. The total standing current in the memory
cell operated at a supply voltage of 2.5V is 150µA so that for
the input stage the calculated power consumption is 2mW per
DEPFET column. The hit ﬁnder uses a binary tree structure as
ﬁrst proposed in [20] to ﬁnd two hits out of a pattern of 128
digital inputs within one clock cycle. Measurements on the hit
ﬁnder circuitry implemented on the test chip conﬁrm that a
speed of 50MHz is easily achievable in the chosen technology.
A full chip for a 64x128 DEPFET matrix has been submitted
using radiation tolerant design rules. One important of the
many advantages of the switched current based technique is its
little dependence on smaller and smaller becoming operating
voltages in advanced IC technologies.

The sequencer chip (SWITCHER) generates high voltage
(<20V) signals for gate on/off and CLEAR of rows. In order to
provide a wide voltage range for testing of the ﬁrst matrices,
a special ’high voltage’ 0.8µm technology has been chosen.
The chip (photo in ﬁg. IV-Cb) contains 64 channels with
analog multiplexers, a digital sequencer and control logic. It is
designed to be suited for of all fabricated DEPFET matrices
for the different applications including 50MHz operation at
TESLA. Several chips can be daisy chained to control larger
arrays. Measurements on the fabricated prototype chip show
that it is fully functional at 30 MHz speed. By addressing
2 pixels at the same time (see ﬁg. 4) the target line rate for
TESLA would be 25 MHz, i.e. a time of 40 ns per line, during
which sampling of the signal current, CLEAR, and sampling
of the pedestal current must be done.

The total power consumption has been calculated using
measured currents and voltages of prototype detectors and
chips, and assuming that rows can be switched off while
not being read out. Scaled to the total pixel vertex detector
[1] of TESLA with 5 layers, the sensor is expected to have
a power consumption of 0.3W, while the ICs consume ∼3-

READOUT SCHEME FOR DEPFET PIXEL MATRICES AT A LC.

1) Storage Phase: S1 and S2 are closed, S3 open. The
gate capacitance of the transistor M1 is charged until
the device provides the combined input and bias current
(IM1 = Iin + IB).

2) Sampling Phase: S2 is opened. The gate voltage and
therefore the transistor current ideally remain unchanged.
3) Transfer Phase: Immediately after sampling S1 is opened
and S3 closed. As the current through M1 is still IM1 =
Iin + IB, Iin must be delivered by the output node.
Thus, in the ideal case Iout = −Iin. However, this simple cir-
cuit suffers from several non-ideal effects like charge-injection
of the sampling switch S2 and the limited output conductance
of the transistor M1 and the biasing current source. Therefore
in the real case Iout = −Iin + δI where δI indicates the error
made by the sampling process. Many techniques to cope with
these deﬁciencies have been treated in the literature [19]. Here,
cascode techniques have been used for the sampling transistor
and the current source to decrease the output conductance. The
implemented circuitry uses a two stage design to cancel charge
injection and to achieve a high dynamic range with a small
storage error. Measurements using a test chip at a 25MHz
sampling rate (limited by the test setup) show a differential non-

4W (SWITCHER) and ∼1-2W (CURO), respectively. Hence,
we consider a total power budget of less than 5W for the
entire detector to be feasible. This ﬁgure renders air cooling
or alternative low mass cooling to be possible, hence offering
a very low total material budget (≪ 1% X0).

V. CONCLUSION

In contrast to other trends in monolithic or semi-monolithic
pixel detector developments (see e.g. [21], [22]), partially using
incomplete charge collection, DEPFET pixels excel in excellent
energy (ENC = 2.2e, σE=131 eV) and space (4.3 µm at 20
keV X-rays) resolutions. This can be exploited in a variety
of applications. In biomedical autoradiography the excellent
imaging performance of DEPFET pixels has been demonstrated
by space resolved imaging of Tritium-labelled biological tis-
sue. A spatial resolution for 3H of ∼7µm as inferred from
measurements with X-ray sources has been concluded. For the
future use of DEPFET pixels for X-ray astronomy within the
ESA-XEUS mission or for high energy particle vertex tracking,
smaller and,
in terms of resolution, still better performing
DEPFET structures have been developed. For use at a future
Linear Collider a R/O architecture integrated circuits have been
developed with speeds larger by a factor 1000 than achieved
so far. These include a current based R/O chip with fast and
low noise current memory cells and a current-hit ﬁnder.

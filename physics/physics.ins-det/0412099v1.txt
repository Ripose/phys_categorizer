Spin-polarized electron photoemission has been studied for GaAs/GaAs1−xPx
strained superlattice cathodes grown by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy. The
superlattice structural parameters are systematically varied to optimize the photoe-
mission characteristics. The heavy-hole and light-hole transitions are reproducibly
observed in quantum eﬃciency spectra, enabling direct measurement of the band
energies and the energy splitting. Electron-spin polarization as high as 86% with
over 1% quantum eﬃciency has been observed.

1. Introduction

Single strained GaAs photocathodes were introduced for the SLAC polar-
ized electron source in 1993. After 10 years of experience with many cathode
samples, the maximum polarization using the GaAs/GaAsP single strained-
layer cathode remains limited to 80%, while the quantum eﬃciency (QE)
for a 100-nm epilayer is only 0.3% or less. Two known factors limit the po-
larization of these cathodes: 1) a limited band splitting; and 2) a relaxation
of the strain in the surface epilayer since the 10-nm critical thickness for the
1% lattice-mismatch is exceeded. Strained superlattice structures, consist-
ing of very thin quantum well layers alternating with lattice-mismatched
barrier layers are excellent candidates for achieving higher polarization since
they address these two issues. Due to the diﬀerence in the eﬀective mass
of the heavy- and light-holes, a superlattice exhibits a natural splitting of
the valence band, which adds to the strain-induced splitting. In addition,

each of the superlattice layers is thinner than the critical thickness. This
paper presents an investigation of strained GaAs/GaAsP superlattice sam-
ples in which the principal structural parameters are systematically varied
to deﬁne the optimum structural details 1.

2. Experiment

Four parameters specify the superlattice structure: the GaAs well width,
the GaAs1−xPx barrier width, the phosphorus fraction, and the number of
periods. Table 1 summarizes the eleven superlattice samples studied here.

Figure 1 shows the polarization and QE as a function of the excitation
photon energy for Sample 3. The peak polarization is 86% with 1.2% QE.
The QE spectrum shows two distinct steps as expected from the density
of states for the two dimensional structure. The ﬁrst step corresponds
to the heavy-hole (HH) band to the conduction band excitation, while the
second step corresponds to the light-hole (LH) band to the conduction band
excitation. The energy splitting between the HH- and LH-bands is 82 meV.
When the phosphorus fraction is varied, the lattice-mismatch between
the well and the barrier changes, thus the superlattice strain can be varied.
While a larger phosphorus fraction generates a larger strain and therefore
a larger energy splitting between the HH and LH bands, the strain within
a layer may relax. For Samples 1, 2, 3, and 4, the phosphorus fraction
was increased from 0.25 to 0.40 keeping the total superlattice thickness

the HH-LH energy splitting increased from 60 meV to 89 meV, the peak
polarization and the QE anisotropy did not change signiﬁcantly at about
85% and 1.7%, respectively, indicating that this degree of energy splitting
is suﬃcient to maximize the spin polarization.

Using samples with the same well (4 nm)/barrier (4 nm) thickness and
phosphorus fraction (x=0.36), the total superlattice thickness was varied.
Figure 3 shows the peak polarization and QE anisotropy as a function of the
number of superlattice periods using Samples 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Also shown
in Figure 3 is the strain relaxation in the superlattice GaAs well layers
measured using x-ray diﬀraction. Although the well width is smaller than
the critical thickness, increased superlattice periods will result in strain
relaxation. As the strain relaxation steadily increases with the superlattice
thickness, the peak polarization and QE anisotropy appear constant at
85.5%, and 1.5%, respectively, for less than 15 periods. At more than 20
periods, however, the peak polarization decreases and the QE anisotropy
increases rapidly.

Figure 3. Peak polarization (solid circles), QE anisotropy (open circles), and strain
relaxation (triangles) as a function of the superlattice period.

The QE and polarization spectra can be understood in terms of the su-
perlattice band structure. In particular, the band structure is very sensitive
to the well width. Using samples with the same barrier thickness (3 nm) and
phosphorus fraction (x=0.36), the well thickness was varied while the num-
ber of periods was adjusted to keep the same total superlattice thickness.
Figure 4 shows the spin polarization as a function of the excitation photon
energy for Samples 9, 10, and 11. As the well thickness was increased, the
polarization spectra shifted towards lower energy. The peak polarization
was, however, independent of the well thickness. While the changes in the
band structure diﬀerentially aﬀected the polarization spectra for energies
above the polarization peak, the maximum polarization remained constant

well thicknesses was suﬃcient.

3. Conclusions

We have investigated polarized photoemission from strained GaAs/GaAsP
superlattice structures by systematically varying the superlattice parame-
ters. The heavy- and light-hole excitations have been observed for the ﬁrst
time in the QE spectra, enabling direct measurements of the heavy- and
light-hole energy bands. Spin polarization as high as 86% is reproducibly
observed with the QE exceeding 1%. The superlattice structures have su-
perior polarization and QE compared to the single strained-layer structures
of GaAs/GaAsP photocathodes.

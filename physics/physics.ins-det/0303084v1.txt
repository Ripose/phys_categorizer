Abstract

We have constructed and tested a 2d position sensitive parallel-plate gas ionization
chamber with scanned charge transfer readout. The scan readout method described
here is based on the development of a new position dependent charge transfer tech-
nique. It has been implemented by using gate strips perpendicularly oriented to the
collector strips. This solution reduces considerably the number of electronic readout
channels needed to cover large detector areas. The use of a 25µm thick kapton etched
circuit allows high charge transfer eﬃciency with a low gating voltage,consequently
needing a very simple commutating circuit. The present prototype covers 8×8 cm2
with a pixel size of 1.27 × 1.27 mm2. Depending on the intended use and beam
characteristics a smaller eﬀective pixel is feasible and larger active areas are possi-
ble. This detector can be used for X–ray or other continuous beam intensity proﬁle
monitoring.

1 Introduction

To monitor high rate beam ﬂuency gas ionization chambers based devices

it is necessary to have a highly segmented anode [2] [3]. This represents a

major problem when the size of the chamber is large compared with the anode
segmentation pitch. In the present work we describe a new and simple solution
developed to give real two dimensional readout on a gas ionization chamber.
The method consists on scanning electronically the detector active area in the
perpendicular direction to the readout strips orientation (strips instrumented
with the measuring electro-meters). Gated charge transfer is a well known
method which has been used in diﬀerent radiation detectors like, for example,
gated gas-ﬁlled Time Projection Chambers [4] in High Energy Physics.

The transfer of electrons drifting from the detector volume to the collector
electrode strips can be blocked by means of a local electric ﬁeld that dominates
the drift ﬁeld in the proximity of the gate electrode strips (see simulation in
Figure 1). In this way we provide a single stage control of the charge transfer
from the gas drift region to the collector electrodes. In this work we proﬁt
from the great development of Micro–Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) [5] in
the last years, specially the advances on kapton etching techniques. In our case
we integrated a gating grid using a two metal layer circuit based in a kapton
foil glued on a FR4 epoxy substrate to provide mechanical rigidity. The use of
a 25µm thick kapton foil to produce a two level readout circuit allows to use
a small gating voltage.

2 Prototype description

To design and optimize the geometry of the gate and collector electrodes we
simulated the electric ﬁeld map of a transfer gap cell through MAXWELL3D 2
and MATLAB 3 programs. For the ﬁnal design it was chosen a 1:2:1 ratio

corresponding to the transfer gap height:gate–spacing:gate–width. With this
geometry we expected to have a low electron transfer transparency (well bellow
1%) using a relatively low positive (+5V) ”closed gate” voltage 4 and moderate
drift ﬁelds (∼ 105 V/m). A wider gate strip spacing would increment the
electron transparency for a given negative ”open gate” voltage, but also higher
positive voltages would be needed to block eﬃciently the electron drift. On
the other hand the local electric ﬁeld present around the gate strip either in
open or closed mode should not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the electric ﬁeld in the drift
region. This is another important reason to use a small transfer gap between
the gate and collector strips.

The readout circuit layout of this prototype is described in Figure 2. We used
a 25µm thick kapton foil metal coated on both sides with 5µm copper. After
etching of the copper, we obtained 35µm wide and 1 mm wide strips on the
gate and collector plane respectively. The foil was glued on a 1mm FR4–epoxy

substrate and subsequently kapton in the gap between gate strips was removed
obtaining the Figure 2 micro-pattern. In order to provide a simple connection
procedure a 64 pin 1/10 inch pitch standard connector was included in the
board edge design for both gate and collector strips. This choice implies a
1.27 mm pitch in the detector active area. The collector strips were thus made
1mm wide with 1.27 pitch while 17 gate strips were joined in a group in the
detector edge to achieve the previous eﬀective pitch. The drift gas gap was
built using a G10 6mm height frame glued on the readout board, and this
volume was closed with a drift electrode made of 200µm thick G10 copper
clad on one side.

3 Charge transfer

The experimental transparency for electrons obtained as a function of the gate
voltage is shown in Figure 4. This measurements were done using pure Ar at
atmospheric pressure, and corresponds to the ratio of the ionization current
under X–ray irradiation measured at the collector and at the drift electrode.
The plot shows that very small transparency values (∼ 10−3) can be obtained
for low positive voltages at ”closed mode”. The transparency increases when
applying negative voltages at the gating electrodes, showing that there is a
transition region centered on -15V, and can reach values very close to 1 (”open
mode”) when the gate voltage is below -20V. If the drift ﬁeld is increased, the
gate voltage has also to be increased proportionally to maintain the same
transparency value. The fraction of current produced by electrons arriving to
the gate electrode is the complementary value of the transparency calculated
for the collector. We have chosen -17V as open gate voltage as this value can
be commutated using standard CMOS analogue switches. If we consider the
width of the gate strips w (35 µm in Figure 2) and the corresponding space
between gate strips c (40 µm in Figure 2), the expected electron transparency
t is equal to the optical limit deﬁned by

being Vg and Vd the gate and drift voltages respectively, g the height of the
gate strips over the collector electrodes and h the gas gap below the drift elec-
trode. The measured maximum transparency signiﬁcantly deviates from this
expectation due to the trapezoidal etching of the kapton layer that partially
covers the collector electrodes in the space between gate strips.

4 Two dimensional readout

To demonstrate the working principle of our position sensitive charge transfer
scan readout method, a small area of the prototype was instrumented with
charge integration electronics. To drive the detector, two separate electronic
boards were used, one with the commutation circuit to sequentially commutate
from closed to open gate voltage on the gate strips and another board with
the necessary electronic readout channels to integrate the charge collected by
each individual collector strip (integrators board). To integrate the collector
current we used a precision switched IVC102 [6] integrating ampliﬁer (with
an internal feedback capacitor set to 10 pF).

To sequentially change the voltage value applied to each gate strip a shift reg-
ister was used, built by means of daisy chained D–type ﬂip–ﬂops (HEF40174B)
whose outputs were connected to double analogue switches (AD7592DI). These
analogue switches commute from closed gate voltage value (that keeps the
electron transparency at lowest values), to a negative open gate voltage value
giving a high electron transparency for the selected gate strip (typically >70%
in our setup). A scheme of the readout circuit is shown on Figure 5. For the
synchronous control of the two electronic boards we used a personal computer
PCI embedded card 5 .

The ﬁrst prototype was instrumented with a total number of 96 eﬀective pixels
(on an active area of 15.2 × 10.2 mm2), corresponding to 12 gate channels
and 8 collector channels. The total capacitance at the detector between gate
and collector plane is 7nF, meaning a 2pF capacity per pixel. This gate–
collector capacity gives a 2µs transient time during commutation, considering
the 3kΩ impedance of the IVC102 (with switches S1+S2 closed). This dead
time is small compared with the typical integration times used (of the order
of milliseconds). The total time required to obtain an image is equal to the
integration time needed to integrate the charge transfered by each gate strip
times the number of gate strips.

Fig. 5. Scheme of the 2d scan readout. By default all the gate electrodes are con-
nected to a bias voltage (positive, closed gate voltage) giving low electron trans-
parency. During the readout cycle each individual gate electrode strip is sequentially
set to a voltage value (negative, open gate voltage) that modiﬁes the electric ﬁeld
around the gate strip. This allows the transfer to the collector plane of a large
fraction of the electrons present at the volume deﬁned by the drift electrode a the
selected gate strip. A typical readout time sequence is shown.

Figure 6 and 7 show two X–ray images obtained with this prototype using a
Chromium X–ray tube: a 1.5 mm slit between two 5mm thick aluminum plates
and a 5mm screw nut were illuminated. The closed and open gate voltage
values used were +5V and -17V respectively, and the drift ﬁeld applied in the
image was 1.7×104 V/m in pure Ar. To obtain this images a scan readout
cycle time of less than 10 seconds was required, with a collector current value
of 7 pA in the pixels with maximum signal.

The charge transparency value when the gate electrode is set to the closed
state should be ideally zero. But the real value diﬀers from zero by a small
amount (i.e. 0.1%). This causes a leakage current, of a value proportional
to the detector area, that can seriously distort the image. Nevertheless, if
the leakage current per eﬀective pixel is small we can correct this eﬀect by
what we have called diﬀerential readout. The correction term is measured by
integrating the detector current during the same time interval used for the
standard readout with all the gate electrodes closed. This value will then be
subtracted as a pedestal from the values obtained with the gate electrodes on
opened state. In this way the image will not be dramatically aﬀected by the
non zero transparency value at the closed gate state.

We have proved the working principle of a simple and reliable readout method
for 2d position sensitive gas ionization detectors. This two dimensional charge

transfer readout solution allows to cover large detector areas giving a high
number of eﬀective pixels and minimizing the number of readout electronic
channels. By using a kapton–insulated two layer readout circuit, charge trans-
fer does not aﬀect the drift ﬁeld and the control of the charge transfer process
can be done with very low voltage values. The detector can be used not only
with gases but with other photo-conductive media like non–polar liquids (i.e.
isooctane or tetrametilsilane). For low beam intensity or fast readout cycle
applications, an intermediate gas avalanche device, like a Gas Electron Mul-
tiplier [7], can be added to improve its sensitivity. Considering moderate gas
gains around 100, an image could be readout with a cycle period 100 times
faster than an equivalent ionization chamber, leading to a fast beam imaging
device.

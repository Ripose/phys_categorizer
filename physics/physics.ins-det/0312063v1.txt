Abstract

Studies of the radiation hardness of lead tungstate crystals produced by the Bo-
goroditsk Techno-Chemical Plant in Russia, the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics in
China have been carried out at IHEP, Protvino. The crystals were irradiated by a
40-GeV pion beam. After full recovery, the same crystals were irradiated using a
137Cs gamma source. The dose rate proﬁles along the crystal length were similar
in both cases. We compare the eﬀects of the two types of radiation on the crystals
light output.

1 Introduction

In high luminosity collider experiments, lead tungstate (P bW O4) crystals used in electro-
magnetic calorimeter will be irradiated by high energy particles and accumulate signiﬁcant
absorbed doses, up to a several Mrad. The radiation hardness of P bW O4 crystals has
been studied by the CMS group using radioactive sources and electron beams [1] and by
the BTeV group using both high energy pion and electron beams, resulting in particle
environment that is similar to that expected when running the BTeV experiment [2,3].
The goal of this study is to compare the radiation damages of crystals using two types
of irradiation, either a high energy pion beam or a 137Cs radioactive source. If the eﬀects
of these two types of radiation are similar, we could use source measurements to classify
the radiation resistance of each crystal in the BTeV like environment. This would be
considerably easier than using pion beams for this measurement. This is crucial for a
crystal quality assurance before assembling the electromagnetic calorimeter. However, the
world experience has not the data of a comparative study of the crystals radiation damage
under hadron beam and gamma source irradiation. The ﬁrst attempt in this direction is
described in this paper.
The integrated expected dose distribution in the BTeV crystals is shown in Table 1
assuming a collider luminosity of 2 × 1032 cm−2s−1 and a running time of 107 s.

Since the BTeV calorimeter starts close to the beam-line, about 15 cm away, and extends
to a radius of 160 cm, the amount of radiation varies greatly. Near the beam-line a small
fraction of the crystals, ∼1% have doses of about 104 Gy (1 Mrad), while 90% of the
crystals have doses less than 0.1 Mrad. The latter corresponds to a dose rate of 36 rad/h.
About 70% of the crystals have dose rates < 4 rad/h.

We used three crystals produced by the Bogoroditsk Techno-Chemical Plant in Russia
(denoted as CMS-2442, CMS-2443, Bogo-2313 ) and three more crystals produced by the
Shanghai Institute of Ceramics in China (denoted as Shan-T16, Shan-T19, Shan-T20 ). All
the crystals except those which are marked as CMS were produced at the end of 2000. The
CMS crystals were produced in 2001. The dimensions of the crystals were ∼ 27 × 27mm2
in cross section and 220mm in length. The CMS crystals had the same length but were
tapered with 29×29mm2 at the back. Each crystal was wrapped using 170µm thick Tyvek.

The crystals were irradiated by a 40 GeV π− beam, four of them in April 2001 and the
other two CMS crystals in April 2002. After the recovery process at room temperature
the crystals were irradiated by 137Cs gamma source in May and June 2003. We provided
very close irradiation conditions, dose rates and absorbed doses in crystals, for both cases.
Two types of measurements were done on each crystal both before and after the gamma
irradiation: a) light output (LO) measurements using a radioactive source for crystal
excitation, and b) crystal transparency measurements using a spectrophotometer.

2 Irradiation by pions

A pion irradiation was carried out at the IHEP(Protvino) 70-GeV accelerator. The size
of the 40 GeV π− beam was 8 cm horizontally and 6 cm vertically, i.e. 90% of the beam
was contained within these dimensions. The beam was present in 1.2 second interval of
the full accelerator cycle of 9 sec. Six crystals were irradiated with a dose rate ranging
from 30 to 60 rad/h. The crystals light output signals were monitored using the minimum
ionizing particles (MIP) in pion beam running and electron beam data from separate low-
intensity calibration runs. The LeCroy 2285 15-bit integrating ADC was used to measure
the signal using a 150 ns integration time. The Protvino testbeam setup was described in
detail elsewhere [3,4,5].

3 Irradiation by 137Cs source

We used a gamma radioactive source 137Cs ( E = 0.661 MeV) with activity of 5 · 1012 Bq
to irradiate the crystals. The geometrical setup for each crystal position is shown in Fig.1.
Each crystal was irradiated separately. Commercial dosimeter DKS-AT1123 was used to
measure the dose rate (in air) in proximity to the crystals. The accuracy is better than
25% [6].

To modify the spatial dose distribution from the source in order to make it as similar as
possible to pion beam, we used a lead screen placed between the source and the crystals
and also rotated the crystals along their longitudinal axes at a rate of 2 turns per minute.
The lead screen was made using four lead plates with varying dimensions [7]. The dose
rate distributions along the length of crystal are compared for both the pion and source
irradiation in Fig.2 using the lead screen and rotating the crystals. We see that the proﬁles

are quite similar. The rotation is even more important for insuring a uniform irradiation
transverse to the crystal axis when using the source. In Fig.3 we show the transverse
radiation proﬁles for case (a) where the crystal was not rotated and for case (b) where
it was rotated. Since pion irradiation uniformly illuminates the crystals in transverse
direction, we use the crystal rotation for all the source results in this paper. Two sets of
gamma irradiation were carried out. One of them was done using dose rates of (30-60)
rad/h, and the second one at the dose rate of 110 rad/h for each crystal. The crystals
were allowed to recover during two weeks, at room temperature, between the ﬁrst and the
second sets of irradiation. After each exposition the crystal was removed from the place
of irradiation to dedicated test stands for light output and transmittance measurements.
This procedure usually took about 1 to 1.5 hours.

4 Light output and transmittance measurements

A stand with a radioactive source was designed to study a changes in the crystal light
output due to radiation damage. Scintillation light was detected by a XP2020Q photo-
multiplier tube (PMT). The PMT output was connected to a 20 kOhm load. The mean
current through this load was measured by a 11-bit ADC read out by a computer. The
PMT high voltage value was of 1.5 kV. The PMT nonlinearity in the direct current mode
was less than 1% in the range of 1.2 kV to 2 kV. The dark current was ∼ 2·10−3 relative to
the average signal level. The background current, mostly due to direct PMT irradiation by
the source was ∼ 5·10−3 of the average signal at the worst. The gamma radioactive source
Cs-137 (7 · 108 Bq) was installed inside a cylindrical lead collimator, 30 mm in diameter
and 40 mm in height with aperture diameter of 5.3 mm. The crystals were wrapped by a
Tyvek, except for one end which was attached to the PMT without optical grease. The
source was moved longitudinally along the central line of the crystal with a step of 2 cm.

Fig. 4. Light output loss for six crystals versus absorbed dose under gamma irradiation at the
ﬁxed dose rate for each crystal. There were several measurements for the two crystals, CMS-2443
and Bogo-2313 (upper part) which show a fast signal loss at absorbed doses up to (100-200) rad
and then a further slow signal loss down to saturation. The results of measurements for other
four crystals (bottom part) are consistent with the ﬁrst two, but were taken at longer intervals.

The distance between the source and the crystal surface was 5 mm. The measurements
of the average direct current were provided in the same way for each of the 9 position
along the crystal. The mean value over these 9 measurements gives us a value of a light
output signal of each crystal. The light output measurements were monitored using a
non-irradiated reference crystal. Performing measurements on non-irradiated crystals, we
estimate the systematic error to be at most 3% of the relative light output degradation.
The temperature was measured during irradiation and during light output monitoring .
The temperature variations were ∼ 1 degree on average, and up to 2 degrees in the worst
case. There were no corrections for the temperature variations. The full systematic errors
of the monitoring measurements include the eﬀects of the temperature diﬀerences.

To measure a light transmittance curve of each crystal, a commercial spectrophotometer
SF-26 was used in the wave length region from 340 up to 700 nm with a steps of 10
nm. The spectrophotometer light spot was 5 mm in diameter with a negligible angular
dispersion. The measurement accuracy at each point was 1%.

5 Results and discussion

The dependence of a signal loss on the accumulated dose (at a ﬁxed dose rate) for six
crystals irradiated by 137Cs source is shown in Fig.4. Two crystals lost 10% of their signal
or less under the source irradiation and four other crystals lost (15-25)%. The signal loss
in transmittance curves at wavelengths of (420-550) nm measured with the use of the
spectrophotometer is one order of magnitude less. For example crystal CMS-2442 showed
losses between 2-2.5% ( see Fig.5). This diﬀerence might be due to diﬀerent optical paths
in crystal taken by the injected spectrophotometer light as compared with the scintillation
light. From now on we will show only the results from the radioactive source measurements
that are more sensitive than the spectrophotometer measurements in indicating the eﬀects
of radiation.
It has been shown that P bW O4 transmission damage occurs in the crystal when valence
electrons are trapped in metastable states around crystal defects. Thus, the irradiation of
P bW O4 crystals creates so called color centers which reduce the light attenuation length.
When the rate of color centers production (proportional to the dose rate) equals to natural
recovery rate , the crystal light output will reach a saturation level[8]. Fig.4 shows that
the signal degrades relatively rapidly with the absorbed dose up to (100-200) rad and
then degrades at a signiﬁcantly slower rate until the saturation level is reached. The light
loss has a tendency to exhibit saturation when the dose rate is kept at a constant level.
Each crystal demonstrates a diﬀerent level of light loss in the saturated state. We found
that the saturation level is reliably reached after ∼10 hours of continuous irradiation at
the ﬁxed dose rate. We did not observe a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in radiation hardness of
the crystals from diﬀerent manufacturers.

The second round of gamma irradiation was done with the dose rate of 110 rad/h for each
crystal after two weeks of crystals recovery at room temperature. Because we irradiated
the crystals with 110 rad/h gamma-source for a long time, ∼(60-70) hours, we believe
that we reached the signal loss saturation level for each crystal at this high dose rate. The
dependence of the normalized signal loss (in state of saturation) on a dose rate for the six
crystals under gamma irradiation is shown in Fig.6.

The normalized signal loss versus of the absorbed dose under 40 GeV pion irradiation
for the same crystals is presented in Fig.7. The points on the plot represent the level of
signal loss in state of saturation at the ﬁxed dose rates. The rate of the signal degradation
is practically the same for both irradiation procedures up to the dose rates of 60 rad/h.
Using gamma irradiation at a dose rate of 110 rad/h does not lower the saturation level
of some of the crystals, while others are aﬀected (see Fig.6). This is an indication that the
relative diﬀerence of the crystal signal losses demonstrated at dose rates of 30-60 rad/h
might change at larger dose rates.

Pion/gamma ratio

Fig. 8. Ratios of two signal losses at their saturation levels, under pion and under gamma
irradiation for the same dose rates (30-60 rad/h) for six crystals.

Ratios of pion/gamma signal losses at saturation, caused by irradiation at the same dose
rates, for the six crystals are shown in Fig.8. We see that these ratios are close to each
other and are in the region between 0.8 and 1. Thus we can conclude that a pion and
a gamma irradiation at the same dose rates aﬀect radiation hardness of lead tungstate
crystals similar way.
We shall continue our study. The major goal of the further measurements is to carry out
crystal radiation studies for signiﬁcantly larger number of crystals using the light output
measurements continuously during the gamma irradiation process.

6 Summary

We have observed that a relative signal loss under 40-GeV pion irradiation and a signal
loss under 137Cs radioactive source irradiation looks similar at the dose rate of (30-60)
rad/h.
We consider that gamma-source might be used for a crystal quality control. Approximately
10 hours irradiation at the ﬁxed dose rate will be enough to reach a saturation plateau
for each crystal.
The dose rate can be chosen in the range of (60-100) rad/h because the most of the
crystals will be suﬀering from the lower dose rates at the BTeV experiment.

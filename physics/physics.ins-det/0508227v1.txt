Abstract

We report the operation of a 87Rb maser in the self-oscillating

mode, using a laser diode as the optical pumping source. The maser

uses a TE021 cavity surrounding a cell containing the atoms and 11

Torr of N2 as the buﬀer gas. The optical pumping is accomplished

by using a commercial laser diode frequency-locked on the linear ab-

sorption line of an external rubidium cell. The maser output power

frequency through the variation of its injection current. The maser

output power is also presented for various modulation waveforms and

frequencies. We ﬁnd that the spurious sidebands induced by the mod-

ulation can be minimized. Finally, the linear dependence between the

laser and maser frequencies is shown. We ﬁnd that the relative maser
frequency pulling from the laser is about 4.6 × 10−3.

Introduction

The availability of high quality, low cost laser diodes, brings many opportu-

nities in metrology. This is especially true in optical pumping experiments

where their tunability permits the replacement of the traditional spectral

lamp or the cumbersome dye laser. Recently, many papers reported their

use for the optical pumping of various alkalis such as cesium [1], [2]. We used

a similar technique to optically pump a rubidium maser, replacing the usual

lamp-isotopic ﬁlter conﬁguration by a laser diode. Two reasons motivate this

study. The conventional active frequency standard showed a frequency sta-
bility of about 5 × 10−14 for averaging times of the order of 100 s, but starts

to deteriorate for longer times [3]. The light ﬂuctuations were supposed to be

a major cause for the long-term instabilities. Optical pumping from the laser

brings the possibility of a better control of these ﬂuctuations. Also proper

operation of the maser involves three temperatures for the cavity, the ﬁlter

and the lamp. The gradients of temperature present, and the volume of the

elements complicate the design of a compact, temperature stabilized optical

pumping module.

II. Description

The maser (Fig. 1), uses a cylindrical TE021 mode microwave cavity contain-
ing a quartz bulb in which a 87Rb vapor is present with about 11 Torr of N2

used as a buﬀer gas. The cavity is made of a quartz cylinder coated with

silver and its resonance frequency is tuned to 6.83468 GHz corresponding

to the transition frequency between the two mF = 0 ground state hyperﬁne

levels of the atoms. One end of the cavity is equipped with a coupling loop to

bring the maser signal to the receiver, and with a piston for its ﬁne frequency

tuning. The other end has a screen made of a silver coated corrugated ribbon

so the pumping light can enter into the cavity. The loaded quality factor of

the cavity is around 27000.

The pumping light is derived from a commercial laser-diode selected for
use at 780.027 nm, corresponding to the 52S1/2, F=1 ⇐⇒ 52P3/2, F = 0, 1, 2

transitions, the Doppler width of each transition overlapping. At this wave-

length, the optical power delivered by the laser is around 18 mW.

Coarse adjustment of the wavelength is achieved by setting the case tem-

perature of the laser with the use of a thermoelectric cooler, while ﬁne tun-

ing is achieved with the change of the injection current. The light is ﬁrst

collimated and injected into the maser cavity. The collimated beam waist
dimensions are about 3×9 mm. The light enters the cavity near the side wall

and then shines in all directions and polarizations. It was not possible with

this setup to evaluate the light intensity distribution, but this arrangement

produced the best output power. Also, no optical isolator was needed in

order to avoid feedback light which could result in laser mode hoppings.

A portion of the laser beam is sent through an external cell containing also

a Rb vapor in order to lock the nominal laser frequency on the absorption

resonance. Fig. 2 shows the arrangement for the laser frequency-locking

system. An additional photodetector and an analog voltage divider were

used to compensate for the change in the output power of the laser when

the injection current is varied. The signal from the divider is then phase

compared with the modulation signal. The resulting error signal is then

proportional to the frequency diﬀerence between the laser and the absorption

resonance.

Three deterministic types of modulation signal were used: sine, triangle

and square waves. Fig. 3 shows the error signal observed when the laser is

scanned across the resonance line, for typical operating conditions and for the

diﬀerent modulation waveforms. The scale reference for the frequency axis is

determined by measuring the injection current required to reach the center

of each of the two absorption lines of the external cell which corresponds

to a 6.521 GHz frequency oﬀset [4]. All the curves are adjusted for the

coincidence of the zero of the error signal. The same setting, frequency scale

and operating conditions are used in Figs. 3, 4, 5 and 9.

The discriminator gain and the locking range are about the same for both

sine and triangle wave modulation. They are somewhat restrained for square

wave, due to the large modulation excursion. This should be taken into

account if this type of modulation is to be used.

III. Output Power

When the laser is unmodulated, its linewidth of about 25 MHz is too narrow

to pump a suﬃciently large number of atoms and to maintain the maser

oscillation. Therefore it is necessary to modulate the laser frequency. This

modulation results in a broadening of the laser spectrum, thus allowing opti-

cal pumping of all classes of atomic velocities. The beneﬁts of this broadening

are limited by available laser power and undesired pumping from the 5S1/2,

F=2 level, thus resulting in a decrease in the maser power.

Fig. 4 shows the output power of the maser as a function of the average

laser frequency detuning for the various modulation waveforms. The am-

plitude of the modulation was adjusted for the maximum maser power for

each modulation waveform. We also used a 50 kHz bandwidth, Gaussian

ﬁltered white noise as a modulation source. The ero of the horizontal axis

is arbitrary for this type of modulation since the locking system is useless in

the absence of a periodic waveform. All the curves are shown for the same

optical power (18 mW) and modulation frequency (5 kHz). We observe that

the power is maximum when the modulating waveform is square. On the

opposite, the Gaussian noise is the less eﬃcient source of modulation. We

also note an assymetry of the curves. This is due to the presence of the
neighboring 5S1/2, F=2 ⇐⇒ 5P3/2, F=1,2,3 transitions.

The laser spectrum for low modulation frequency can be expressed as

the convolution of the unmodulated laser spectrum itself and the probability

density function of the modulating signal. For example, since a randomly

starting triangle wave has a uniform probability density function, the central

part of the modulated laser spectrum wiﬀ also be uniform. Fig. 5 shows the

estimated spectrum of the laser for the four modulation waveforms used in

the experiments. The modulation amplitudes are respectively 1.08, 1.40, 1.75

GHz peak for square, sine and triangle and 1.3 GHz RMS for the gaussian

noise. It also shows the unmodulated laser spectrum and absorption curve

of the vapor, which is a Voigt proﬁle.

This ﬁgure, along with Fig. 4 shows that the best maser output power

is obtained by an optimum distribution of the light intensity over the ab-

sorbtion proﬁle of the atomic vapour. Hence a narrow linewidth laser would

cause excessive relaxation for the microwave coherence, thus killing the maser

action.

The maser output power also varies drastically with the modulation fre-

quency. Fig. 6 shows the output power as a function of the modulation

frequency. We see that the power suddenly drops when the frequency is be-

low a certain threshold.

In fact, when the modulation period comes close

to the relaxation times, the changes in laser frequency are not fast enough

to pump all class of atoms simultaneously and the gain drops. This means

that the pumping of the atoms is not only due to the power spectrum of the

pumping light, but also to the speed of its variation.

Fig. 7 shows the power of the maser when its temperature and the light

intensity are changed for square wave modulation. We observe the same type

of dependence as the conventional maser. These curves show a maximum

output power for a certain light intensity. This maximum increases as the

number of atoms increases. Although this phenomenon will eventually be

limited by relaxation of the atoms, the behavior of the curves shows us that

the output power of the maser is actually limited by the available laser power.

Other waveforms showed a similar behavior although the maser was less

powerful.

IV. Maser Frequency

Modulating the laser frequency also results in a frequency modulation of the

maser signal. Fig. 8 gives the relative level of the modulation sidebands

when the modulation frequency is changed. We see that they decrease as the

frequency modulation is increased at a rate of about 20 dB per decade. Their

eﬀect can be minimized by a proper choice of the modulation frequency. As

an example for a modulation frequency of 20 kHz the curve shows sidebands
levels of about −50 dBc. This level could deteriorate the short term stability
to a level of about 3 × 10−13τ −1 [5], which is the same as the stability of

the maser itself. Moreover, the maser signal is used to phase-lock a quartz

oscillator through a coherent receiver. It has been shown that the optimum

bandwidth of the phase-locked loop is around 1 kHz [6], so the remaining

spurious sidebands will be ﬁltered out [7].

Fig. 9 shows the maser frequency when the laser is detuned. Again the

zero oﬀset for the noise modulation is arbitrary. We observe that the fre-

quency dependence of the curve is about the same for all types of modulation.
The measured pulling coeﬃcient ym/yl is about 4.6 × 10−3. The frequency

stability of the maser has been measured with the laser unlocked, and showed
a ﬂicker ﬂoor level of about 1 × 10−11, leading to a laser stability of 5 × 10−9,

which is typical for the setup we used [4].

This stresses out the importance of the laser frequency stabilization in

order to achieve good performances. The frequency locking of the laser im-

proves its stability by two orders of magnitude [4], which would bring the
maser stability to about 5 × 10−13. Recently, techniques have been reported

to further increase the stability of the laser [8]. These techniques along with

a cavity tuning system based on light intensity modulation could result in

presently unachievable performance.

V. Conclusion

Laser diode used as a pumping source on the rubidium maser will permit the

construction of a more compact frequency standard. The design of the maser

involves the broadening of the laser spectrum in order to maximize the maser

power. Periodic deterministic modulations are preferable to random mod-

ulations, since they produce higher maser power and permit the frequency

locking technique on an external absorption cell. It has been shown that the

modulation frequency has to be high enough in order to ensure high maser

power and low frequency modulation spurious. Measurements have shown

a relative laser frequency pulling over the relative maser frequency of about
4.6 × 10−3.

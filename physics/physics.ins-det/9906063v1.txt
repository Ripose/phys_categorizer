Abstract. In this review the basic interaction mechanisms of charged and neu-
tral particles are presented. The ionization energy loss of charged particles is
fundamental to most particle detectors and is therefore described in more detail.
The production of electromagnetic radiation in various spectral ranges leads to
the detection of charged particles in scintillation, Cherenkov and transition ra-
diation counters. Photons are measured via the photoelectric eﬀect, Compton
scattering or pair production, and neutrons through their nuclear interactions.

A combination of the various detector methods helps to identify elementary
particles and nuclei. At high energies absorption techniques in calorimeters pro-
vide additional particle identiﬁcation and an accurate energy measurement.

INTRODUCTION

The detection and identiﬁcation of elementary particles and nuclei is of
particular importance in high energy, cosmic ray and nuclear physics [1–6].
Identiﬁcation means that the mass of the particle and its charge is determined.
In elementary particle physics most particles have unit charge. But in the
study e.g. of the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays diﬀerent charges
must be distinguished.

Every eﬀect of particles or radiation can be used as a working principle for

a particle detector.

The deﬂection of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld determines its mo-

mentum p; the radius of curvature ρ is given by

where z is the particle’s charge, m0 its rest mass and β = v
particle velocity can be determined e.g. by a time-of-ﬂight method yielding

where τ is the ﬂight time. A calorimetric measurement provides a determina-
tion of the kinetic energy

From these measurements the ratio of m0/z can be inferred, i.e. for singly
charged particles we have already identiﬁed the particle. To determine the
charge one needs another z-sensitive eﬀect, e.g. the ionization energy loss

dE

(a is a material dependent constant.)

Now we know m0 and z separately. In this way even diﬀerent isotopes of

elements can be distinguished.

The basic principle of particle detection is that every physics eﬀect can be
used as an idea to build a detector. In the following we distinguish between
the interaction of charged and neutral particles. In most cases the observed
signature of a particle is its ionization, where the liberated charge can be
collected and ampliﬁed, or its production of electromagnetic radiation which
can be converted into a detectable signal. In this sense neutral particles are
only detected indirectly, because they must ﬁrst produce in some kind of
interaction a charged particle which is then measured in the usual way.

The scattering of a particle of charge z on a target of nuclear charge Z is

mediated by the electromagnetic interaction (ﬁgure 1).

Energy Loss of Charged Particles

Charged particles interact with a medium via electromagnetic interactions
by the exchange of photons. If the range of photons is short, the absorption
of virtual photons constituting the ﬁeld of the charged particle gives rise to
ionization of the material. If the medium is transparent Cherenkov radiation
can be emitted above a certain threshold. But also sub-threshold emission of
electromagnetic radiation can occur, if discontinuities of the dielectric constant
of the material are present (transition radiation) [7]. The emission of real
photons by decelerating a charged particle in a Coulomb ﬁeld also constitutes
an important energy loss (bremsstrahlung).

The energy-loss rate of muons in iron is shown in Figure 4 [6]. It exhibits a

Due to the ln γ-term the energy loss increases again (relativistic rise, loga-

rithmic rise) until a plateau is reached (density eﬀect, Fermi plateau).

The Bethe-Bloch formula describes the average energy loss of charged par-
ticles. The ﬂuctuation of the energy loss around the mean is described by an
asymmetric distribution, the Landau distribution [10,11].

Figure 6 shows the energy loss distribution of 3 GeV electrons in an Ar/CH4

35 the δ-ray contribution to the energy loss falls inversely proportional to
the energy transfer squared, producing a long tail, called Landau tail, in the
energy-loss distribution up to the kinematical limit (see also ﬁgure 3).

The asymmetric property of the energy-loss distribution becomes obvious
for thin absorbers. For larger absorber thicknesses or truncation techniques
applied to thin absorbers the Landau distribution gets more symmetric.

Scintillation in Materials

Scintillator materials can be inorganic crystals, organic liquids or plastics
and gases. The scintillation mechanism in organic crystals is an eﬀect of
the lattice. Incident particles can transfer energy to the lattice by creating
electron-hole pairs or taking electrons to higher energy levels below the con-
duction band. Recombination of electron-hole pairs may lead to the emission
of light. Also electron-hole bound states (excitons) moving through the lattice
can emit light when hitting an activator center and transferring their bind-
ing energy to activator levels, which subsequently deexcite. In thallium doped
NaI-crystals about 25 eV are required to produce one scintillation photon. The
decay time in inorganic scintillators can be quite long (1µs in CsI (Tl); 0.62 µs
in BaF2).

In organic substances the scintillation mechanism is diﬀerent. Certain types
3%) of the absorbed energy as
of molecules will release a small fraction (
optical photons. This process is expecially marked in organic substances which
contain aromatic rings, such as polystyrene, polyvinyltoluene, and naphtalene.
Liquids which scintillate include toluene or xylene [6].

≈

This primary scintillation light is preferentially emitted in the UV-range.
The absorption length for UV-photons in the scintillation material is rather
short: the scintillator is not transparent for its own scintillation light. There-
fore, this light is transferred to a wavelength shifter which absorbs the UV-light
and reemits it at longer wavelengths (e.g. in the green). Due to the lower con-
centration of the wavelength shifter material the reemitted light can get out
of the scintillator and be detected by a photosensitive device. The technique
of wavelength shifting is also used to match the emitted light to the spectral
sensitivity of the photomultiplier. For plastic scintillators the primary scin-
tillator and wavelength shifter are mixed with an organic material to form a
polymerizing structure. In liquid scintillators the two active components are
mixed with an organic base [2].

About 100 eV are required to produce one photon in an organic scintillator.
The decay time of the light signal in plastic scintillators is substantially shorter
compared to inorganic substances (e.g. 30 ns in naphtalene).

Because of the low light absorption in gases there is no need for wavelength

shifting in gas scintillators.

Plastic scintillators do not respond linearly to the energy-loss density. The
number of photons produced by charged particles is described by Birk’s semi-
empirical formula [6,14,15]

N = N0

dE/dx
1 + kB dE/dx

,

(44)

where N0 is the photon yield at low speciﬁc ionization density, and kB is
Birk’s density parameter. For 100 MeV protons in plastic scintillators one has

dE/dx
eﬀect of

10 MeV/(g/cm2) and kB ≈
≈
5% [4].
∼

For low energy losses eq. 44 leads to a linear dependence

5 mg/(cm2MeV), yielding a saturation

while for very high dE/dx saturation occurs at

N = N0

dE/dx ,

·

N = N0/kB .

There exists a correlation between the energy loss of a particle that goes into
the creation of electron-ion pairs or the production of scintillation light because
electron-ion pairs can recombine thus reducing the dE/dx
ion-signal. On the
|
other hand the scintillation light signal is enhanced because recombination
frequently leads to excited states which deexcite yielding scintillation light.

Cherenkov Radiation

A charged particle traversing a medium with refractive index n with a ve-
locity v exceeding the velocity of light c/n in that medium, emits Cherenkov
radiation. The threshold condition is given by

The Cherenkov eﬀect can be used to identify particles of ﬁxed momentum
by means of threshold Cherenkov counters. More information can be obtained,
if the Cherenkov angle is measured by DIRC-counters (Detection of Internally
Reﬂected Cherenkov light). In these devices some fraction of the Cherenkov
light produced by a charged particle is kept inside the radiator by total internal
reﬂection. The direction of the photons remains unchanged and the Cherenkov
angle is conserved during the transport. When exiting the radiator the photons
produce a Cherenkov ring on a planar detector (ﬁgure 7).

8 [16].

regions represent a 5% uncertainty in the absolute momentum scale [17]

16

Transition Radiation

Transition radiation is emitted when a charged particle traverses a medium
with discontinuous dielectric constant. A charged particle moving towards a
boundary, where the dielectric constant changes, can be considered to form
together with its mirror charge an electric dipole whose ﬁeld strength varies in
time. The time dependent dipole ﬁeld causes the emission of electromagnetic
radiation. This emission can be understood in such a way that although the
dielectric displacement ~D = εε0 ~E varies continuously in passing through a
boundary, the electric ﬁeld does not.

The energy radiated from a single boundary (transition from vacuum to a
medium with dielectric constant ε) is proportional to the Lorentz-factor of the
incident charged particle [6,14,18]:

where ¯hωp is the plasma energy (see equation 34). For commonly used plastic
radiators (styrene or similar materials) one has

The typical emission angle of transition radiation is proportional to 1/γ.

The radiation yield drops sharply for frequencies

The γ-dependence of the emitted energy originates mainly from the harden-
ing of the spectrum rather than from the increased photon yield. Since the
radiated photons also have energies proportional to the Lorentz factor of the
incident particle, the number of emitted transition radiation photons is

The number of emitted photons can be increased by using many transitions
(stack of foils, or foam). At each interface the emission probability for an X-
ray photon is of the order of α = 1/137. However, the foils or foams have to be
of low Z material to avoid absorption in the radiator. Interference eﬀects for
radiation from transitions in periodic arrangements cause an eﬀective thresh-
old behaviour at a value of γ
1000. These eﬀects also produce a frequency
dependent photon yield. The foil thickness must be comparable to or larger

the energy of muons in the TeV-range.

Bremsstrahlung

If a charged particle is decelerated in the Coulomb ﬁeld of a nucleus
a fraction of its kinetic energy will be emitted in form of real photons
(bremsstrahlung). The energy loss by bremsstrahlung for high energies can

The important point about bremsstrahlung is that the energy loss is pro-
portional to the energy. The energy where the losses due to ionization and
bremsstrahlung for electrons are the same is called critical energy

For solid or liquid absorbers the critical energy can be approximated by [6]

Direct Electron Pair Production

Direct electron pair production in the Coulomb ﬁeld of a nucleus via virtual
photons (“tridents”) is a dominant energy loss mechanism at high energies.
The energy loss for singly charged particles due to this process can be repre-
sented by

It is essentially - like bremsstrahlung - also proportional to the particle’s
energy. Because bremsstrahlung and direct pair production dominate at high
energies this oﬀers an attractive possibility to build also muon calorimeters
[2]. The average rate of muon energy losses can be parametrized as

= a(E) + b(E)

E

(69)

where a(E) represents the ionization energy loss and b(E) is the sum of direct
elektron pair production, bremsstrahlung and photonuclear interactions.

The various contributions to the energy loss of muons in standard rock (Z

= 11; A = 22; ρ = 3g/cm3) are shown in ﬁgure 10.

Nuclear Interactions

Nuclear interactions play an important role in the detection of neutral par-
ticles other than photons. They are also responsible for the development of
hadronic cascades. The total cross section for nucleons is of the order of
50 mbarn and varies slightly with energy. It has an elastic (σel) and inelastic
part (σinel). The inelastic cross section has a material dependence

with α = 0.71. The corresponding absorption length λa is [2]

Strong interactions have a multiplicity which grows logarithmically with
energy. The particles are produced in a narrow cone around the forward
direction with an average transverse momentum of pT = 350 MeV/c, which is
responsible for the lateral spread of hadronic cascades.

A useful relation for the calculation of interaction rates per (g/cm2) is

φ((g/cm2)−1) = σN ·
where σN is the cross section per nucleon and NA Avogadro’s number.

INTERACTION OF PHOTONS

momentum conservation one can derive the ratio of scattered (E′

photon energy (Eγ)

INTERACTION OF NEUTRONS

In the same way as photons are detected via their interactions also neutrons
have to be measured indirectly. Depending on the neutron energy various
reactions can be considered which produce charged particles which are then
detected via their ionization or scintillation [2].

The conversion material can be a component of a scintillator (e.g. LiI
(Tl)), a thin layer of material in front of the sensitive volume of a gaseous
detector (boron layer), or an admixture to the counting gas of a propor-
tional counter (BF3, 3He, or protons in CH4).

The (n, p)-recoil reaction can be used for neutron detection in detectors
which contain many quasi-free protons in their sensitive volume (e.g.
hydrocarbons).

c) High energies (E > 1 GeV)

Neutrons of high energy initiate hadron cascades in inelastic interactions
which are easy to identify in hadron calorimeters.

Neutrons are detected with relatively high eﬃciency at very low energies.
Therefore, it is often useful to slow down neutrons with substances containing
many protons, because neutrons can transfer a large amount of energy to
collision partners of the same mass.
In some ﬁelds of application, like in
radiation protection at nuclear reactors, it is of importance to know the energy
of ﬁssion neutrons, because the relative biological eﬀectiveness depends on it.
This can e.g. be achieved with a stack of plastic detectors interleaved with
foils of materials with diﬀerent threshold energies for neutron conversion [21].

Since the coupling constant of weak interactions has a dimension of 1/GeV2,
the neutrino cross section must rise at high energies like the square of the
center-of-mass energy. For ﬁxed target experiments we can parametrize

σ(νµN) = 0.67
σ(¯νµN) = 0.34

This shows that even at 100 GeV the neutrino cross section is lower by 11
orders of magnitude compared to the total proton-proton cross section.

ELECTROMAGNETIC CASCADES

The development of cascades induced by electrons, positrons or photons
is governed by bremsstrahlung of electrons and pair production of photons.
Secondary particle production continues until photons fall below the pair pro-
duction threshold, and energy losses of electrons other than bremsstrahlung
start to dominate: the number of shower particles decays exponentially.

Already a very simple model can describe the main features of particle
multiplication in electromagnetic cascades: A photon of energy E0 starts the
cascade by producing an e+e−-pair after one radiation length. Assuming that
the energy is shared symmetrically between the particles at each multiplication
step, one gets at the depth t

HADRON CASCADES

The longitudinal development of electromagnetic cascades is characterized
by the radiation length X0 and their lateral width is determined by multiple
scattering. In contrast to this, hadron showers are governed in their longitudi-
nal structure by the nuclear interaction length λ and by transverse momenta
of secondary particles as far as lateral width is concerned. Since for most

Part of the energy of the incident hadron is spent to break up nuclear
bonds. This fraction of the energy is invisible in hadron calorimeters. Further
energy is lost by escaping particles like neutrinos and muons as a result of
hadron decays. Since the fraction of lost binding energy and escaping par-
ticles ﬂuctuates considerably, the energy resolution of hadron calorimeters is
systematically inferior to electron calorimeters.

The longitudinal development of pion induced hadron cascades is plotted
in ﬁgure 17. Figure 18 shows a comparison between proton, iron, and photon
induced cascades in the atmosphere [24].

FIGURE 17. Longitudinal development of pion induced hadron cascades [25]

The diﬀerent response of calorimeters to electrons and hadrons is an unde-
sirable feature for the energy measurement of jets of unknown particle com-
position. By appropriate compensation techniques, however, the electron to
hadron response can be equalized.

PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION

Particle identiﬁcation is based on measurements which are sensitive to the
particle velocity, its charge and its momentum. Figure 19 sketches the diﬀerent
possibilities to separate photons, electrons, positrons, muons, charged pions,
protons, neutrons and neutrinos in a mixed particle beam using a general
purpose detector.

Even the abundance of diﬀerent helium isotopes can be determined from
a velocity and momentum measurement (ﬁgure 21 [27]). This is feasable,
because at ﬁxed momentum the lighter isotope 3He is faster than the more
abundant 4He.

CONCLUSION

Basic physical principles can be used to identify all kinds of elementary
particles and nuclei. The precise measurement of the particle composition in
high energy physics experiments at accelerators and in cosmic rays is essential
for the insight into the underlying physics processes. This is an important
ingredient for the progress in the ﬁelds of elementary particles and astrophysics
aiming at the uniﬁcation of forces and the understanding of the evolution of
the universe.

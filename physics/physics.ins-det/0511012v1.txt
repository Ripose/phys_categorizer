Abstract

Scintillating crystals are used for calorimetry in several high-energy physics experiments. For many
of them, performance has to be ensured in very difﬁcult operating conditions, like a high radiation
environment and large particle ﬂuxes, which place constraints on response and readout time. An
overview is presented of the knowledge reached up to date, and of the newest achievements in the
ﬁeld, with particular attention given to the performance of Lead Tungstate crystals exposed to large
particle ﬂuxes.

1 Introduction

This report addresses the performance of scintillating crystals used for high-energy physics calorimetry, when
operation implies high radiation levels and intense particle ﬂuxes.

The effect of high levels of ionising radiation on crystals has been studied in depth and reported upon by many
authors, as crystals were used e.g. in e+e− collider experiments, and their growth parameters were optimised for
best performance in such environments. They are brieﬂy summarised herein. Hadron collider detectors today share
the same concern, but add to it the need to ensure adequate performance when crystals are exposed to large particle
ﬂuxes. Such running conditions are namely expected in several experiments under construction or designed. Some
new results are thus presented here, together with a fresh look at existing, older ones, to provide, as far as possible,
a complete picture.

2 Performance under high ionising radiation levels

Ionising radiation is known to produce absorption bands through formation of colour centres, which reduce the
Light Transmission (LT) and thus the Light Output (LO), due to oxygen contamination in alkali halides like BaF2
and CsI, and to oxygen vacancies and impurities in oxides like BGO and PbWO4 [1]. Phosphorescence or af-
terglow appear sometimes[2], which increase the noise levels in the detected light signal, possibly worsening the
energy resolution (in a negligible way for PbWO4 in LHC experiments[3]), while the scintillation mechanism is
generally not damaged. Recovery of damage at room temperature can occur depending on crystal type and growth
parameters, giving rise to a dose-rate dependence of damage equilibrium levels[1, 4] and to a recovery speed de-
pendent on the depth of traps. That ionising radiation only affects LT, means the damage can be monitored through
light injection and corrected for, as it is done in the CMS Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL)[5].

3 Performance in large particle ﬂuxes
The way hadron ﬂuxes affect crystals has become a crucial question while detectors making use of this calorimetry
technique are being constructed. In particular, it had to be ascertained whether such ﬂuxes cause a speciﬁc, possibly
cumulative damage, and if so, what its quantitative importance is, whether it only affects LT or also the scintillation
mechanism. Extensive studies have been recently performed on PbWO4 at IHEP Protvino[6] and, for the CMS
ECAL, at CERN and ETH-Z¨urich[7]. Their main results are quoted and discussed herein.
Crystal tests at Protvino were using e− and π beams and γ sources up to a few krad at 1 to 60 rad/h at one end, and
a very intense mixed beam of charged hadrons, neutrons and γ up to 3 Mrad at 1 krad/h and 100 krad/h equivalent
ﬂuxes at the other end. In individual e−, π and γ irradiations, the signal loss behaviour is found to be qualitatively
similar between electrons and pions, and the damage appears to reach equilibrium at a dose-rate dependent level.
Furthermore, no indication of damage to the scintillation mechanism from π irradiation is found[8]. A concern
remains however, that an additional, speciﬁc, possibly cumulative damage from hadrons cannot be excluded and
could appear when a high total integrated dose is reached. This concern is partially conﬁrmed by irradiations in the
very intense, mixed beam. Under the constant ﬂux used, the damage appears in fact to be steadily increasing with
accumulated dose. This is unlike pure ionising radiation damage, which reaches equilibrium at a level depending
on dose rate, not beyond what saturation of all colour centres can yield. Therefore, this constitutes an indication
for a cumulative, hadron-speciﬁc damage.

ECAL barrel (end caps) ∼ 1012 (∼ 1014) charged hadrons/cm2 . A hadron-speciﬁc damage could arise from the
production, above a ∼ 20 MeV threshold, of heavy fragments (“stars”), with up to 10 µm range and energies up to
∼100 MeV, causing a displacement of lattice atoms and energy losses along their path up to 50000 times the one
of minimum-ionising particles. The damage caused by these processes is likely different from the one of ionising
radiation, thus possibly cumulative. The primarily investigated quantity was the damage to Light Transmission

Light Transmission at 420 nm before and after irradiation. The Perkin Elmer Λ900 spectrophotometer used, allows
in fact to measure LT very accurately, to better than 1%. Transmission is furthermore related to LO changes,
provided scintillation is not affected.

Eight CMS production crystals of consistent quality were irradiated at the IRRAD1 facility of the CERN PS accel-
erator T7 beam line[10] in a 20 GeV/c proton ﬂux of 1012 p/cm2/h (crystals a”, b, c, d, e, h) or of 1013 p/cm2/h

(crystals E, F’, G) 1). To disentangle the contribution to damage from the associated ionising dose, complemen-
tary 60Co γ-irradiations were performed at a dose rate of 1 kGy/h on seven further crystals (t, u, v, w, x, y, z) at
the ENEA Casaccia Calliope plant[11]. In fact, a ﬂux of 1012 p/cm2/h has an associated ionising dose rate in
PbWO4 of 1 kGy/h. The LT data in Fig. 1(a) show a smooth worsening of LT with increasing proton ﬂuence over
the entire range of wavelengths, and a clear shift of the Transmission band-edge. In γ-irradiated crystals (Fig. 1(b),
where also the emission spectrum[12] is indicated), the band-edge does not shift at all, even after the highest cu-
mulated dose reached: just the usual absorption band appears around 420 nm. These data thus give prominence to
the qualitatively different fundamental nature of proton-induced and γ-induced damage.

The correlation in Fig. 2(a), between µIN D(420 nm) and ﬂuence, is consistent with a linear behaviour over two or-

from small centres of severe damage. This is consistent with an origin of damage due to the high energy deposition
of heavily ionising fragment along their path, that changes locally the crystal structure. Taking into account the
difference in composition and energy spectra between 20 GeV/c protons and CMS, simulations indicate that the
test results cover the CMS running conditions up to ∼ 2.6. An experimental conﬁrmation is expected in the future

from a pion-irradiation of PbWO4, closely approximating the CMS particle spectrum and energies.

The evolution of Light Output was also monitored on the same set of irradiated crystals, using cosmic muons,
traversing the crystals transversely and thus leaving approximately 30 MeV of energy deposit, to excite scintil-
lation. The correlation[13] between µIN D(420 nm) and Light Output loss is shown in the top part of Fig. 3 for
all proton-irradiated crystals, and at the bottom for all γ-irradiated ones. The vertical bars indicate the systematic
scale uncertainty affecting the data for a’ and F’. For both, proton-irradiated and γ-irradiated crystals, the measured
Light Output loss correlates well with µIN D(420 nm). Furthermore, within the precision of the measurements, no
difference can be observed in this correlation between the two sets of crystals and thus no hadron-speciﬁc alteration
of the scintillation properties can be claimed.

Proton and γ data are also compared in a study performed on BGO[14]. The changes in band-edge are similar
to what is seen in PbWO4, and long enough after irradiation, when the ionising-radiation damage contribution
has recovered, one can extract a remaining proton-induced damage that behaves linearly with ﬂuence, as visible
in Fig. 4. The same exercise is not possible on CsI data from the same authors[15] because the damage caused by
ionising radiation gives a contribution which is too important to allow disentangling the proton-speciﬁc one.

In conclusion, one can say that for all crystals commonly used in calorimetry, beyond the well-studied damage
from ionising radiation, the understanding of additional contributions to the damage, when crystals experience a
substantial hadron ﬂux, has become important since experiments are being built having to cope with such running
conditions. A hadron-speciﬁc, cumulative contribution, likely due to the intense local energy deposition from
heavy fragments, has been observed in PbWO4 and BGO. Over the explored ﬂux and ﬂuence ranges and within
the accuracy of the measurements, this contribution is observed to only affect Light Transmission, and thus can
be monitored through light injection. Additional studies are expected to consolidate the present understanding of
hadron damage.

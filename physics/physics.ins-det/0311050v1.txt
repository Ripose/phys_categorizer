Abstract

The tracking system of the CMS experiment, currently under construction at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), will include a silicon
pixel detector providing three spacial measurements in its ﬁnal conﬁguration for
tracks produced in high energy pp collisions. In this paper we present the results
of test beam measurements performed at CERN on irradiated silicon pixel sensors.
Lorentz angle and charge collection eﬃciency were measured for two sensor designs
and at various bias voltages.

Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN
(Geneva, Switzerland) will be equip-

dinates of the tracks. It will con-
sist of three layers of pixel sensors
(100 µm × 150 µm pitch size) in the
barrel region and two discs in the
forward regions [1]. The innermost
barrel layer is expected to be exposed
to a ﬂuence 2 of 3 × 1014 neq/cm2
luminosity. The

second and third layer will be ex-
1.4 × 1014 neq/cm2 and
posed to
0.6 × 1014 neq/cm2 per year, respec-
tively. The charge sharing induced
by the Lorentz force in the 4 T CMS
detector magnetic ﬁeld can improve
the spatial resolution. Hence it is
very important to study the eﬀects
of charge collection eﬃciency and
Lorentz drift in irradiated silicon de-
vices. Here we present measurements
of Lorentz angle and charge collec-
tion eﬃciency, and compare two sen-
sor designs at diﬀerent irradiation
doses.

2 Experimental setup

The measurements were performed
in the H2 beam line of the CERN
SPS in June and September 2003 us-
ing 150-225 GeV pions. A silicon ref-
erence telescope [2] was used to allow
a precise determination of the parti-
cle hit position in the pixel detector.
Both, the telescope modules and the
pixel front-end, were mounted onto a
common frame (see ﬁg. 1). The beam
telescope consists of 4 modules. Each
consists of two 300 µm thick single-
sided silicon detectors (32 × 30 mm2)
with a strip pitch of 25 µm (read-
out pitch of 50 µm), which are ori-
ented perpendicularly. The resulting
intrinsic resolution of the beam tele-
scope is around 1 µm.
The pixel sensor with the readout
chip is mounted on a rotating support
positioned between the second and
the third module. A trigger signal is
generated by a silicon PIN diode. The

slow control (temperature and bias
voltage of the pixel sensor) is written
in LabView and LabWindows CVI
(National Instruments) running on a
PC. The analog signals are digitized
in a VME based readout system by
two CAEN (V550) and one custom
built FADCs [3]. The whole setup
was placed in a open 3 T Helmholtz
magnet with magnetic ﬁeld parallel
to the beam. The pixel sensors were
cooled down up to −30◦ C by means
of water cooled Peltier elements.

3 Pixel sensors and front-end

electronics

The CMS pixel sensors are manu-
factured in the ”n-on-n” technique,
consisting of n+ structures on n bulk
silicon. This allows a partially de-
pleted operation of highly irradiated
sensors after type inversion, but re-

2

quires inter-pixel isolation. Two iso-
lation techniques were considered
in our latest prototype designs: p-
spray [4], where a uniform medium
dose of p-impurities covers the whole
structured surface, and p-stop, where
higher dose rings individually sur-
round the n+-implants. Fig. 2 shows
the layouts of these designs. Due to
possible failures in the pixel contacts
(bump-bonding) an intrinsic biasing
method has to be introduced. This
is realized by a bias grid and punch-
trough structures [5] for the p-spray
detectors and by openings in the
rings for the p-stop detectors. All our

sured sensors showed a breakdown
voltage above 600 V. Finally the
sensors were bump bonded to non
irradiated readout chips of the type
PSI30/AC30 [7] allowing for a non
zero-suppressed analog readout of all
704 pixel cells. A fast (20 ns) exter-
nal signal for the internal sample and
hold mechanism had to be provided
from the trigger PIN diode.

4 Beam test measurements

4.1 Lorentz angle measurements

The Lorentz angle is obtained by the
direct measurement of the charge
drift in the magnetic ﬁeld using the
grazing angle method [8]. The par-

test devices had 22 × 32 pixels, with
a sensitive area of 2.75 × 4 mm2, and
a thickness of 280 µm. The readout
pitch was 125 µm × 125 µm.
Some of the devices were irradi-
ated in a 24 GeV proton beam
at the CERN PS. The sensors re-
ceived total particle ﬂuences of
3.3×1014 neq/cm2, 8.1×1014 neq/cm2
and 1.1 × 1015 neq/cm2 respectively.
During the irradiation the sensors
were kept at room temperature and
without bias, while after irradia-
tion we stored and operated them at
−20◦ C. IV -curves were measured [6]
before and after irradiation, all mea-

ticle beam (parallel to the magnetic
ﬁeld) hits the pixel surface at a shal-
low angle α = 15◦ (see ﬁg. 3). The
deposited charge drifts according to
the combined electric and magnetic
forces, resulting in a deﬂection of
the particle track projection on the
surface by the angle β. The Lorentz
angle is obtained from the relation

3

tan ΘL = tan β/ tan α.
The deﬂection measured at 3 T mag-
netic ﬁeld is shown in ﬁg. 4 for the
non-irradiated p-spray sensor. The

angle β is measured by slicing the
histogram perpendicularly to the y-
axis. The position of the center of
each slice is shown in ﬁg. 5 as a func-
tion of the position along the y-axis.
A measurement without magnetic
ﬁeld is used to correct for the detec-
tor misalignment with respect to the
beam (bottom line in ﬁg. 5). For the
irradiated device in ﬁg. 5 there are
two regions with a diﬀerent slope,
and hence, two diﬀerent values of the
Lorentz angle. The diﬀerence in the
Lorentz angle can be explained by
nonuniform distribution of the elec-
tric ﬁeld in the irradiated devices.
Diﬀerent models of the electric ﬁeld
distribution in the irradiated silicon
devices are discussed in Refs. [9,10].
The evidence of the non-uniform
electric ﬁled will be shown also in the
next section.
As most of the signal charge is col-
lected from the region close to the
pixel implant, this region was used
to determine the Lorentz angle. Fig-

irradiated sensors a Lorentz angle of
26◦ can be reached at a bias voltage
of 100 V, while irradiated sensors
have to be operated at higher bias
voltages, where the Lorentz angle
drops to roughly 10◦. Since the elec-
tron mobility increases with decreas-

measured at the lower temperature

agreement with measurements and
simulations in Refs. [11,12].

4.2 Charge collection in irradiated

sensors

After irradiation the collected charge
decreases due to charge trapping and
partial depletion of the sensor. The
measurements of the charge collec-
tion eﬃciency as a function of the
sensor depth were performed using
the grazing angle method without
magnetic ﬁeld. The averaged charge
cluster proﬁles in non-irradiated and
irradiated p-spray sensors are shown
in ﬁg. 7. In the unirradiated sen-
sor the charge is collected uniformly
across the whole sensor depth, while
the irradiated devices shows two re-
gions with diﬀerent collected charge.
At low bias voltage in the irradi-
ated detectors some charge is also
collected from the side opposite to
the pixel implants. This can indicate
that the depletion starts from both
sides of the detector, because of the
nonuniform distribution of the elec-
tric ﬁled. The integral of the collected

by the regions with reduced sensitiv-
ity. The average charge collected in
the hit pixel as a function of the hit
position is shown in ﬁg. 10 for non-
irradiated and irradiated sensors.
One can see that after irradiation
the average pixel signal decreases,
and the area with the reduced charge
collection increases in the case of the
p-stop design.
The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) av-
eraged over the whole pixel area
is shown in ﬁg. 11. The measured
signal-to-noise ratio is above 30 even
after the irradiation. We observe
lower S/N ratio in the unirradiated
p-stop device, because of the charge
spread over several pixels caused by
the p-stop openings. A more detailed
study of charge collection for these
sensors can be found in Ref. [6].

5 Conclusions

Two diﬀerent designs of the CMS
prototype pixels sensors were tested
up to 600 V bias voltage and after
exposure to particle ﬂuences up to
1.1×1015 neq/cm2. For the irradiated
devices we observe two regions across
the sensor with diﬀerent charge col-
lection and value of the Lorentz an-
gle. This result is an indication of a
nonuniform electric ﬁeld in the irra-
diated devices.
The Lorentz angle mainly depends
on the bias voltage and it shows a
weak dependence on the irradiation
dose or sensor design. The Lorentz
angle at 4 T magnetic ﬁeld reaches
26◦ for the non-irradiated devices
at a bias voltage of 100 V and it
drops to 8.3◦ for the ones irradiated
at 1.1 × 1015 neq/cm2 and at a bias
voltage 600 V.
After irradiation and at high bias
voltage (600 V) the charge collection
is about 60% of the value observed
for the non-irradiated devices, and it
is slightly larger for the p-spray de-
sign.
The signal-to-noise ratio decreases

giving us conﬁdence in operating the
CMS pixel detector up to the maxi-
mum expected irradiation dose.
For the irradiated devices the charge
collection, and therefore the signal
height, increases with the bias volt-
age but the Lorentz angle decreases.
For this reason the bias voltage must
be optimized for the best perfor-
mance of the CMS pixel detector.

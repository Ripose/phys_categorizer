The design and implementation of a current driver for the quadrupole coil of a magneto-

optical trap are presented. The control and the power stages of the driver, both based on a

push-pull conﬁguration with high-speed transistors, are separated, allowing for a protection

of the control electronics. Moreover, the coil current can be set by an analog voltage, a feature

that makes possible both fast and adiabatic switching of the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld. In

order to compensate magnetic ﬁeld transients induced by eddy currents, the driver allows a

quick reversal of the quadrupole coil current providing in such a way the required magnetic

ﬂux compensation. From a ﬁt to the measured magnetic ﬁeld transients, we have extracted

the decay constants which conﬁrm the eﬃciency of the compensation. Furthermore, we

measured the inﬂuence of eddy currents on a sample of cold caesium atoms, testing at the

same time the ultimate performance of the driver for our applications. The results show that

the implemented electronic circuit is able to reduce substantially the transient eﬀects with

switching times of the magnetic ﬁeld below 100 µs.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic ﬁeld gradients play a central role in the preparation of cold atomic samples in magneto-

optical traps (MOT). However, for many experiments involving cold atoms the presence of magnetic

ﬁeld gradients is unwanted. This means that, following the preparation of a cold atomic sample

in a MOT, the time interval that we have at our disposal to perform an experiment is, to some

extent, determined by the time required to turn oﬀ completely the current ﬂowing through the

coils that produce the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT. More precisely, is the time needed

to bring the magnetic ﬁeld gradient to zero that sets the ultimate limit.

The current ﬂowing in the coils can be brought to zero in several microseconds using the common

technique that employs a suppression diode for switching inductive loads [1]. To bring the magnetic

ﬁeld to zero is more diﬃcult since the fast change of the magnetic ﬂux, produced by the coil current,

induces eddy currents in the metallic parts adjacent to the coils. These currents will produce a

time and spatially varying magnetic ﬁeld that dies out typically in several milliseconds, depending

on the experimental setup.

For a MOT, the negative eﬀects due to magnetic ﬁeld transients (and their associated gradi-

ents) generated by eddy currents are seen immediately. This parasitic transient washes out the

sample of cold atoms disturbing, for instance, experiments like loading of optical dipole traps.

In particular, in our experimental setup the metallic environment around the coils producing the

magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld is diﬀerent or asymmetric for the two coils and consequently, the trap

center moves during the switching transient accelerating the atoms, an eﬀect which is deleteri-

ous for transferring the atoms into the optical trap. Yet in another ﬁeld of research as magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) [2], the eddy–current–induced gradients reduce the signal to noise ratio

degrading the quality of the obtained images.

It is possible to ﬁnd diﬀerent proposals for the compensation of eddy currents. A method based

on gradient with pre-emphasis correction [3] is employed in, for example, MRI [4] and particle

storage rings [5], but it requires the monitoring of the magnetic ﬁeld in order to implement a

closed-loop compensation. Also for MRI and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), radiofrequency

shielding of the gradient coils has been developed [6]. Another more interesting, for our purposes,

compensation scheme has been recently implemented by Dedman et al.

for fast switching of

magnetic ﬁelds in a MOT [7]. In their proposal two power MOSFET are used to switch oﬀ or

reverse the polarity of the current ﬂowing through the coils, which allows switching times for the

magnetic ﬁeld of around 350 µs. However, it is our belief that the performance of the circuit can

be improved in two main directions. In terms of protection, it is important to avoid the use of

high voltage power supplies that can seriously damage the control voltage source (a PC card, for

example) in case of failure of the transistors. And, on the other hand, to allow an analog control

of the amount of current fed to the coils, a relevant feature for applications like for example the

preparation of cold samples in the Cs atomic fountain clock [8], where it is necessary to combine

fast as well as adiabatic switching of the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld.

Here we propose a current driver that combines high-speed switching transistors on the control

stage of the circuit and power switching bipolar transistors to handle the coils’ current. Such a

design allows the use of stable low voltage (max. 10 Volts) low current (max. 10 Amps) standard

laboratory power supplies, fast and adiabatic switching of magnetic ﬁelds, and is as practical

to implement as the MOSFET solution. We also provide the design considerations to help the

interested reader in choosing the proper component speciﬁcations for her/his particular application.

II. FAST SWITCHING CURRENT DRIVER DESIGN

Usually, the magnetic ﬁeld ~B(t) transient properties are measured with a pick-up coil which

generates a voltage

,

being N and Φ(t) =

~B(t) ~dS the number of turns of the coil and the magnetic ﬂux sensed by it,

respectively. Therefore, choosing the coil area Sc such that the ﬁeld across it is homogeneous, Vp(t)
will provide a direct measurement of dB(t)
dt

. Qualitatively, the ideal (desired) magnetic ﬁeld switch-

R

ing waveform can be represented by a square pulse and, in this case, the voltage measured by the

pick-up coil can be mathematically described by the expression Vp(t) = −N ScBef f (δ(t1) − δ(t2)),

where Bef f , δ(t), t1, and t2 are the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld amplitude, the Dirac delta function

and the time instants at which the transitions take place, respectively. Nevertheless, the actual

magnetic ﬁeld transient waveform shows exponential transitions characterized by a time constant

determined mainly by two eﬀects: the Lenz eﬀect and the existence of eddy currents induced in

the metallic structures close to the coils producing the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld.

Just as a reminder, the inﬂuence of eddy currents can be studied with the simple electric circuit

model presented in Fig. 1. The elements L and r represent the inductance and the wire resistance

of the MOT coils, respectively. The metallic environment of the coils can be described by the

inductance Lm and the resistance Rm.

where τ = L/r is the Lenz eﬀect time constant, τm = Lm/Rm is the decay constant associated

to the metallic surrounding, and k is a coupling parameter deﬁned by the mutual inductance

M 2 = k2LLm. Consequently, any measured magnetic ﬁeld transient can be mathematically de-

scribed by a superposition of two exponential terms with time constants deﬁned by the quadrupole

coil parameters and the properties of the surrounding metallic environment. This means that one

way for checking the compensation of eddy–current–induced magnetic ﬁeld transients will be to

reduce the double exponential behaviour of the measured transient to a single one. As we will see

later, the designed driver can compensate not only the eﬀect of eddy currents but also speed-up

magnetic ﬁeld transients.

In terms of safety, there are two relevant factors to be considered in order to design a current

driver for switching the MOT coils. One is the back induced emf when the current is switched

oﬀ, and the other is the maximum stored magnetic energy. In our case, for a resulting inductance

L of the coils of 393 µH (wire resistance r =0.7 Ω) the induced emf is

for 15 A current change in about 100 µs. Concerning the stored magnetic energy E, for 15 A of

current we get

In the Fig. 2 the current driver designed to switch the MOT coils is presented. The current sup-

ply for the coil is implemented using the power bipolar transistors 2N2955 and 2N3055, intended

for power switching circuits. The operation of the power transistors is controlled by the control

pulse VIN and the push-pull emitter follower stage realized by the high-speed switching transis-

tors 2N2219 and 2N2905. These transistors, together with the operational ampliﬁer, provide the

necessary isolation of the control pulse source from the high power stage of the circuit.

During the transitions, the power transistors must be able to handle the developed emf and

therefore, we need to choose them with an emitter-collector breakdown voltage of at least the back

induced voltage. In case of failure of the power transistors, usually the collector is short to the

base and, in that situation, it is up to the switching transistors to handle the back induced emf .

For this reason, we need to choose switching transistors with a collector-base breakdown voltage,

again, of at least emf to protect the control electronics. Apart from these considerations, the

diodes D1 and D2 provide a decaying path for the energy accumulated in the coils and another

piece of protection for the low voltage electronics [11].

When the current through the coils is switched from some value to zero, the coils alone induce

a transient with a decay constant τ = L/r of around 0.6 ms (Lenz eﬀect). This time constant can

added a 10 Ω resistor, reducing the decay constant in that way to 36.7 µs. On the other hand,

the use of the Zener diodes DZ1 and DZ2 increases the protection of the circuit. They limit the

and D2 into a linear decay. Now, let’s have a closer look into the functioning of this circuit.

Positive polarity of the control voltage

When the control input voltage VIN is positive, Q1 is forward biased while Q2 is cut oﬀ. In

this situation, the current through R1 is equal to the emitter current of Q1

and therefore, the current ﬂowing into the base of Q1, with a dc current gain β1, is

,

iB1 =

R1(1 + β1)

.

(5)

(6)

6

(7)

(8)

Since the base current necessary to put the power transistor Q3 into conduction equals the

collector current of Q1 then, the current that ﬂows through the collector of Q3, with a dc current

gain β3, is

iC3 = −

β1β3
R1(1 + β1)

VIN .

At this point, we know that Q3 is conducting. So, the diodes D1 and D2 are reverse and forward

biased, respectively. Nevertheless, the voltage at the node OUT is inferior to the Zener voltage of

DZ2 and consequently, very little current ﬂows through R4. This means that the current in the

coils IL is the same as the current in the collector of Q3, namely

IL = −

β1β3
R1(1 + β1)

VIN .

Negative polarity of the control voltage

In case of negative control voltage, the analysis proceeds as above with the appropriate dc

current gains of the transistors in the ﬁnal expression of the coils’ currents.

Zero control voltage

Let’s suppose now that the voltage at the input node IN is zero. In this situation the current

through R1 is zero since its terminals are at the same voltage level. Therefore, no current ﬂows in

the Q1 and Q2 collectors and consequently, the collector currents of Q3 and Q4 are also zero and

so, no current ﬂows into the coils.

Finally, from the expression of the coils’ current, Eq.(8), it can be seen that the level of this

current can be adjusted, or controlled, by the applied voltage VIN at the input node of the circuit,

an important feature for applications where adiabatic switching of the magnetic ﬁeld gradient

is required. Moreover, having ﬁxed the resistor R1 and the dc current gains of the switching

transistors, it is possible to increase the current limit by choosing power transistors with diﬀerent

β3 (β4).

From the preceeding analysis it is clear that the other sensitive elements of this circuit are the

resistors R and R1, chosen as follows. Assuming a reduction of β3 (β4) from 20 to 5 for a peak coils’

current of 10 A, we will need at the base of Q3 a current of 2 A to maintain it into conduction.

Therefore, for a maximum input control voltage of 10 V the resistor R1 is 5 Ω. On the other hand,

to ﬁnd the speciﬁcation of the base resistor R, we demand the output voltage of the operational

7

(9)

ampliﬁer to be 2 or 3 % below its supply voltage, ±15 V in our case. This yields the following

criterion for R

R ≤

12 − VIN − VBE1
IB1

.

If we take the dc current gain β1 of the switching transistor Q1 to be 70, we obtain a peak

base current IB1 of 28.6 mA and, for 10 V of control voltage, VBE1 = 1 V, we get for our designed

circuit that R ≤ 35 Ω.

III. SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The behaviour of the current driver circuit in Fig. 2 has been simulated using TopSPICE 6.97 [9]

and the results of those simulations are presented in Fig. 3. In this ﬁgure we show the coils’ current

and back induced emf transient responses of the circuit to a control voltage pulse of 1 ms duration.

The input voltage level was changed by 10 V (from -5 V to +5 V).

FIG. 3: Current and back emf responses of the current driver.

As we can see in Fig. 3, the current ﬂowing through the coils, at the beginning ∼9 A, decays to

zero very fast (in around 100 µs). The initial fast almost linear decay is dominated by the eﬀect of

8

the resistor R4. Then, the current decay is controlled by the action of the Zener diode DZ2. The

total transition time for reversing the current polarity from +9 A to -9 A is thus around 340 µs.

For these control voltage and current settings, the back induced voltage during the transitions is

close to 150 V.

Since the switching time of the magnetic ﬁeld depends on how much current was ﬂowing in the

coils before the transition started, we also performed simulations for lower input control voltages.

When the input voltage was changed from -0.5 V to +0.5 V, total switching times of the order of

100 µs are obtained, with the corresponding reduction in the back induced emf .

So far the analyzed results concerned the behaviour of the current ﬂowing in the coils. However,

the switching characteristics of the magnetic ﬁeld itself are diﬀerent because of the eﬀect of eddy

currents. For that reason, our next step was the study of magnetic ﬁeld transients when the coils

are driven by the circuit designed in the last section. We measured the magnetic ﬂux transient

using a small (compared to the MOT coils) critically damped pick-up coil (Lp = 7 µH inductance

and 0.1 Ω wire resistance) connected in parallel with a capacitor (C = 2.2 µF) and in series with

a 3.3 Ω resistor. The capacitor limits the frequency bandwidth of the sensing circuit making the

measured magnetic ﬂux rate less susceptible to high frequency magnetic ﬁeld noise generated by,

e.g., radio stations, and the resistor value is chosen in order to obtain critically damped oscillations

when the pick-up coil is kicked by a fast magnetic ﬂux change. We placed the pick-up coil midway

between the MOT gradient coils where the atomic cloud is normally formed, that is to say in

the position occupied by the quartz cell (qc) in the Fig. 4. This location was chosen because it

is at this point that the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the MOT coils is zero and consequently, by

symmetry considerations, any detectable variation of the magnetic ﬁeld there is directly related to

eddy currents. It can be clearly seen from the picture that the two gradient coils (tc and bc) are

surrounded by diﬀerent metallic components, being the bottom coil on an aluminium plate. When

the magnetic ﬁeld produced by these coils is switched oﬀ, it will create eddy currents with a spatial

distribution, generating an unwanted magnetic ﬁeld gradient.

As a reference measurement, we used a commercial current supply with switching times on the

order of hundreds of microseconds to drive the current IL in the quadrupole coil. The transient

response when the current was switched oﬀ from an initial value of 3.1 A is shown in Fig. 5. As

it can be seen in that ﬁgure, the duration of the measured settling time was around 10 ms, much

larger than the power supply switching time and therefore, attributed to the inﬂuence of magnetic

ﬁeld transients due to eddy currents. Together with the experimental points, is also shown in

Fig. 5 the best theoretical ﬁt (solid line), given by a superposition of two exponentials with time

FIG. 4: Experimental setup. When measuring the magnetic ﬂux transients associated with eddy currents,

the pick-up coil is placed in the position occupied by the quartz cell (qc), between the top (tc) and bottom

and we are more sensitive to any magnetic ﬂux generated by eddy currents.

constants of 1.97(17) ms and 0.80(18) ms, respectively. Since these characteristic times are greater

than the expected value corresponding to the Lenz eﬀect alone (36.7 µs), we conclude that we have

an important inﬂuence of eddy currents in the measured magnetic ﬁeld transient.

The ﬁrst test of the designed circuit (Fig. 6) was the measurement of the switching waveform

corresponding to the voltage across the MOT coils, a quantity equivalent to the simulated V (OU T )

in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst voltage spike in this trace was obtained when the coil current was switched on,

to 6.6 A. For the second one, the current was reversed from 6.6 A to -3.7 A, before setting it to 0.

As expected, the duration of the transients were on the microsecond time scale. However,

in order to draw any conclusion about the compensation of the eﬀects due to eddy currents, a

detailed look at the magnetic ﬂux transient is required. This is done in Fig. 7(a) and (b). These

measurement were taken when the current in the MOT coil, initially 6.6 A, was brieﬂy reversed to

-3.7 A before setting it to zero (as in the middle voltage spike in Fig. 6).

Initially, we tested the compensation of the magnetic ﬂux induced by eddy currents. The result

of this measurement is presented in Fig. 7(a), obtained when the Zener diodes DZ1 and DZ2 are

each replaced by a short and therefore, we allow more current to ﬂow through the protection diodes

D1 and D2 when the back induced emf appears. In this ﬁgure, we attribute the initial exponential

decay (dashed line) with a time constant of 150 µs to eddy currents. This decay is shortened down

to around 40 µs when the current is reversed, leaving the single exponential behaviour (solid line)

characterized by a time constant of 32.57(2) µs, in good agreement with the modiﬁed time constant

of the Lenz eﬀect. The overall settling time of the transient is about 190 µs.

Since with the designed driver we are able to provide a larger dIL/dt compared to the one given

by the commercial power supply, we induce larger eddy currents as it can be seen from the absolute

maximum reached by the pick-up coil voltage. Nevertheless, the eddy–current–induced magnetic

ﬁeld transient is compensated by the reversal of the coils current.

In the next test, we try to reduce the settling time by reducing the Lenz eﬀect decay. This

compensation is achieved by removing the short across the Zener diodes. In this case, a current will

ﬂow through the protection diodes only when the voltage at the node OUT in Fig. 2 will be larger

then the respective Zener voltage. Consequently, a larger amount of the compensating current

from the power supply will ﬂow through the quadrupole coil. This eﬀect is shown in Fig. 7(b),

lines, are 200 µs and 150 µs, respectively. The settling time, or the overall transient duration, is

now around 90 µs.

As it was mentioned in the introduction, the magnetic ﬁeld transients induced by eddy currents

can wash out the samples of cold atoms prepared in the MOT. Therefore, we used this fact in

order to perform our ultimate test of the driver. Using a sample of cold caesium atoms (at around

120 µK), we realized an experiment similar to a previous one presented in [10]. In short, we built a

Mach–Zehnder interferometer around the cell containing the cold atoms and we measured the phase

shift that a probe laser pulse, with around 107 photons, experience after interaction with the atoms.
The laser was red detuned by 25 MHz from the Cs cycling transition 6S1/2(F = 4) → 6P3/2(F ′ = 5).
The used protocol for this measurement was as follows:

• we trap the atoms during 3 seconds;

• the magnetic quadrupole ﬁeld, the trapping and the repumper lights are turned oﬀ during

10 ms and, we ﬁre a pulse train with 100 probe pulses (pulse duration 2 µs, repetition period

6 µs) that interact with the atoms;

• during 8 ms we turn on the trapping light only to remove the atoms from the probing region;

12

FIG. 7: (a) Compensation of the magnetic ﬁeld transient induced by eddy currents (dashed line). The decay

constant, obtained from the single exponential ﬁt (solid line) to the Lenz eﬀect transient, was 32.57(2) µs.

(b) Transient speed-up by compensation of the Lenz eﬀect.

• we take a reference measurement with another sequence of 100 pulses.

The above steps are repeated 50 times in order to obtain a reliable data and the results are

presented in Fig. 8. In one case the experiment is done switching the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld

with the commercial unit and in the other with the driver.

The traces covering the ﬁrst 600 µs represent the probe phase shift after the interaction with

the atoms. The results of the reference measurement, probe phase shift in the absence of atoms,

cover the interval starting from 600 µs up to 1200 µs. As it can be seen from the Fig. 8, the

measured atomic contribution when the quadrupole magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT is controlled by the

driver (gray traces) is larger than the atomic contribution measured when the control is done by

the commercial unit (black traces) and without the possibility of compensation of magnetic ﬁeld

transients due to eddy currents. Since the reference measurement results are at the same level in

both cases, we can without ambiguity attribute the reduction in the signal to the fact that less

atoms are probed by the laser pulses.

Finally, from Fig. 7 it is clear that the magnetic ﬁeld can be switched oﬀ about 100 times faster

than in the case without polarity change of the coils’ current. This dramatic reduction of the

transition time from the millisecond down to the microsecond time scale, demonstrate once again

that one of the key factors in the compensation of the undesirable eddy–current–induced magnetic

ﬁeld transients is the possibility of changing very fast the polarity of the current in the MOT

quadrupole coils. In that way, we can overshoot or undershoot the current during the transitions,

providing the necessary magnetic ﬂux for the compensation of stray magnetic ﬁelds.

Abstract

The ATLAS Pixel Detector is the innermost layer of the ATLAS tracking system
and will contribute signiﬁcantly to the ATLAS track and vertex reconstruction. The
detector consists of identical sensor-chip-hybrid modules, arranged in three barrels
in the centre and three disks on either side for the forward region.

The position of the Pixel Detector near the interaction point requires excellent
radiation hardness, mechanical and thermal robustness, good long-term stability,
all combined with a low material budget. The detector layout, results from ﬁnal
prototyping and the status of production are presented.

1 Introduction

The ATLAS Inner Detector [1]
is
designed for precision tracking of
charged particles with 40 MHz bunch
crossing identiﬁcation. It combines
tracking straw tubes in the outer
transition-radiation tracker (TRT)
and microstrip detectors of the semi-
conductor tracker (SCT) in the mid-
dle with the Pixel Detector, the cru-
cial part for vertex reconstruction,
as the innermost component.

into three barrel layers in its centre,
one of them around the beam pipe
(r = 5 cm), and three disks on either
side for the forward direction. With
a total length of approx. 1.3 m this
results in a three-hit system for par-
ticles with |η| < 2.5.

LAS life time dose of 50 MRad or

2 Module Layout

A pixel module consists of a single n-
on-n silicon sensor, approx. 2×6 cm2
in size. The sensor is subdivided into
47,268 pixels which are connected in-
dividually to 16 front-end (FE) chips
via “bumps” [3]. These chips are
connected to a module-control chip
(MCC) [4] mounted on a kapton-ﬂex-
hybrid glued onto the back-side of
the sensor. The MCC communicates
with the oﬀ-detector electronics via
opto-links, whereas power is fed into
the chips via cables connected to the
ﬂex-hybrid.

To provide a high space-point reso-
lution of approx. 12 µm in azimuth
(rφ), and approx. 90 µm parallel to
the LHC beam (z), the sensor is sub-
divided into 41,984 “standard” pixels
of 50 µm in rφ by 400 µm in z, and
5284 “long” pixels of 50 × 600 µm2.
The long pixels are necessary to cover
the gaps between adjacent front-end
chips. The module has 46,080 read-
out channels, which is smaller than
the number of pixels because there is
a 200 µm gap in between FE chips
on opposite sides of the module, and
to get full coverage the last eight pix-
els at the gap must be connected to
only four channels (“ganged” pixels).
Thus on 5% of the surface the infor-
mation has a two-fold ambiguity that
will be resolved oﬀ-line.

The FE chips [3] contain 2880 in-
dividual charge sensitive analogue
circuits with a digital read-out that
operates at 40 MHz clock. The ana-
logue part consists of a high-gain,
fast preampliﬁer followed by a DC-

coupled second stage and a diﬀeren-
tial discriminator. The threshold of
the discriminator ranges up to 1 fC,
its nominal value being 0.5 fC. When
a hit is detected by the discrimi-
nator the pixel address is provided
together with the time over thresh-
old (ToT) information which allows
reconstruction of the charge seen by
the preampliﬁer.

3 Module Prototypes

Several ten prototype modules have
been built with a ﬁrst generation
of radiation-hard chips in 0.25 µm-
technology. In order to assure full
functionality of the modules in the
later experiment, measurements at
the production sites, after irradia-
tion, and in a test beam are per-
formed.

3.1 Laboratory measurements

An important test that allows a large
range of in-laboratory measurements
is the threshold scan. Signals are
created with on-module charge injec-
tion and scanning the number of hits
versus the so injected charge yields
the physical value of the threshold of
the discriminator and the equivalent
noise charge as seen by the pream-
pliﬁer. A set of such scans is used to
reduce the threshold dispersion by
adjusting a DAC-parameter individ-
ually for each channel. The resulting
threshold and noise after threshold
tuning is shown in ﬁgure 1. Typically
approx. 100 e threshold dispersion

across a module and a noise value
of below 200 e for standard pixels is
achieved, as is needed for good per-
formance. In a similar fashion, the
cross-talk is measured to a few per
cent for standard 50×400 µm2 pixels.

approx. the dose expected after 10
years of ATLAS operation. The ra-
diation damage is monitored reading
the leakage current individually for
each pixel. The single event upset
rate is measured during irradiation.

A measurement of the timewalk,
i.e. the variation in the time when
the discriminator input goes above
threshold, is an issue since hits with
a low deposited charge have an ar-
rival time later than those with high
charges, in particular for ganged pix-
els.

Data taken when illuminating the
sensor with a radioactive source al-
lows in-laboratory detection of defec-
tive channels. The source-spectrum
reconstructed from the ToT-readings
is in agreement with expectations.

3.2 Irradiation

Some of the prototype modules have
been irradiated to a dose of 50 MRad,

The threshold dispersion and the
noise after irradiation as shown in
ﬁgure 2 is only modestly increased
and still well in agreement with re-
quirements for operation in ATLAS.

3.3 Test beam measurements

Tests have been performed in the
beam line of the SPS at CERN using
180 GeV/c hadrons. The setup con-
sists of a beam telescope for the po-
sition measurement [5], trigger scin-
tillators for timing measurement to
36 ps, and up to four pixel modules.
The number of defective channels is
observed to less than 10−3 and for
standard 50 × 400 µm2 pixels the
eﬃciency for normal incidence parti-
cles is 99.57±0.15%. The timewalk is
measured to values similar to those
from lab tests (see above).

walk and too little SEU tolerance
have been addressed and solved in a
new design of FE and MCC chips [3].

Modules
irradiated as described
in section 3.2 have been tested in
the beam line and the bias voltage
needed for full depletion is measured
to be between 500 and 600 V, see
ﬁgure 3. The deposited charge is
measured via the ToT readings and
no signiﬁcant changes in the unifor-
mity w.r.t. unirradiated modules are
observed.

3.4 Next generation of chips

The results of the prototype mod-
ules show that the chips fulﬁl largely
the requirements of electrical perfor-
mance and radiation hardness and
that the production process has a
high yield. Problems such as time-

4 Oﬀ-detector electronics

The oﬀ-detector readout electronics
is designed to process data at a rate
of up to 100 kHz level-1 triggers.
The main data-processing compo-
nent is the “read-out driver” (ROD),
of which ﬁrst prototypes have been
built to pixel speciﬁcations and are
being evaluated. The ﬁrst-step event-
building and error ﬂagging is done
via FPGAs. The communication to
the rest of the DAQ-system is run
through a 1.6 Gbit/s opto-link. The
communication to modules, online
monitoring and calibration runs are
performed with SRAMs and DSPs;
their programming is ongoing and
modules have already been conﬁg-
ured and operated successfully with
a ROD.

5.1 Support structures

The mechanics of the system has
to guarantee good positional stabil-
ity of the modules during operation
while the amount of material has
to be kept to a minimum. At the
same time it has to provide cooling
to remove the heat load from the
modules and maintain the sensors at
a temperature of -6◦C to keep the
radiation damage low.

Barrel-modules are glued to “staves”,
carbon-structures with
long, ﬂat
cooling pipes embedded. The staves
are mounted inside halfshells, which
themselves are assembled into frames
to form the barrel system.

The disks are assembled from carbon-
sectors with embedded cooling cov-
ering 1/12 of a wheel. The modules
are glued directly to either side of the
disk sectors.

6 Conclusions

Prototype modules built with a ﬁrst
generation of radiation hard chips
show largely satisfying performance
in laboratory-test, in test beam stud-
ies and after irradiation. Remaining
problems have been solved in a new
generation of chips which is now
ready for production.

Work on the oﬀ-detector electron-
ics and the support structures have
been going on in parallel and are well
on track. First systemtest results are
promising.

First mini-systemtests have been
performed with six modules on a disk
sector and three modules on a barrel-
stave. The noise behaviour on the
disks or staves shows no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences compared to similar mea-
surements with the same modules
individually, see ﬁgure 4. Larger sys-
temtests are already in preparation
and will
include realistic powering
and read-out.

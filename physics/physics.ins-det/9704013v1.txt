Long BGO (Bi4Ge3O12) and BSO (Bi4Si3O12) crystals coupled

with silicon photodiodes have been used to detect minimum-

ionizing particles(MIP). With a low noise ampliﬁer customized for

this purpose, the crystals can detect MIPs with an excellent signal-

to-noise ratio. The nuclear counter eﬀect is also clearly observed

and measured. Eﬀect of full and partial wrapping of a reﬂector

around the crystal on light collection is also studied.

1 Introduction

Bismuth Germanate (Bi4Ge3O12) crystals, commonly known as BGO, have

been extensively used for electromagnetic(EM) calorimetry in high energy

physics experiments[1–3]. Advantages of BGO are its excellent e/γ energy

resolution (0.3 – 1 %/q(E(GeV )), high density(7.1 gm/cc), short radiation

length(1.12 cm), large refractive index(1.251), suitable scintillating proper-

ties(fast decay time of about 300 ns and peak scintillation at about 480 nm)

and non-hygroscopic nature. It is therefore one of the best candidates for EM

calorimetry in collider experiments, especially where space imposes a serious

constraint.

Bismuth Silicate (Bi4Si3O12) crystals, known as BSO, on the other hand, al-

though known to the particle physics community for some time[4], are yet to

ﬁnd a major deployment in a particle detector experiment. BSO has very sim-

ilar properties as BGO : high density(6.8 gm/cc), short radiation length(1.2

cm), large refractive index(2.06), decay time of about 100 ns, peak scintilla-

tion at about 450 nm and non-hygroscopic nature. Although it sells at about

the same price as BGO at the moment, it has the advantage of being cheap if

commercially produced, since the expensive raw material germanium in BGO

is replaced by silicon, which is much cheaper. The light output of pure BSO

crystal, however, is only about one-fourth of that of pure BGO, and hence

energy resolution of a calorimeter made up of BSO will be consequently worse

than that of a BGO calorimeter with similar geometry.

Both, pure BGO and pure BSO are known to be radiation hard at megarad

level [4–6], even upto 100 MRad. This fact, reinforced with the qualities cited in

the above two paragraphs makes these crystals potential materials for making
high resolution EM calorimeters at small angles(below 10◦) in B-factories.

2

Radiation level at such small angles is rather high in B-factories due to intense

ﬂux of photons and electrons generated by Bhabha events and spent-electron

background events[7]. Such a calorimeter has been proposed, for example, for

the BELLE detector[8] at KEK B-factory to cover very small angles around

the beam pipe[9].

With such calorimeters one desires, driven by several physics motivations, to

detect not only EM showers, but also to tag minimum-ionizing particles (MIP),

such as high energy charged pions, muons, kaons and protons. Light output of

these crystals at these small angles is typically read out by photodiodes(PD).

Use of photomultiplier tubes(PMT) at such small angles is severely restricted

due to issues like lack of space and high non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld. PDs

have much lower gain and much worse signal-to-noise ratio than PMTs, and

therefore detecting MIPs becomes a challenge with a BGO(BSO)+PD system,
since MIPs produce a lot less light than e± and γ.

In this paper we report our successful eﬀort in making a low-noise ampliﬁer

system, with which we can detect MIPs with BGO(or BSO)+PD system.

Although the light output of BSO is only 1/4 of that of BGO, we are still able

to see the MIPs with this system.

We describe the design and performance of the preampliﬁers we developed

for this purpose in the next section. Setup for MIP detection by BGO and

BSO crystals by using a high energy pion beam and observation of nuclear

counter eﬀect is described in the third section. In the fourth section we make

an analysis of the data and study the eﬀect of reﬂector around the crystal on

light collection. Results are summarized in the last section.

2 Ampliﬁer

A customized charge preampliﬁer was developed for ampliﬁcation of signal

from photodiodes. Circuit diagram of the preamp is shown in Fig. 1. We

adapted the design from a preampliﬁer used in AMY experiment[10] and

experimented with diﬀerent JFETs. We settled on two brands of preamp :

one using 2SK291, and the other using 2SK715 JFET as the main amplifying

element.

Calculation of gain : An input square pulse sequence of width 200 µs, and

amplitude 60 mV was delivered into the TEST key of the preamp (see Fig. 1).

The output of the preamp was digitized with a CAMAC ADC LeCroy 2249A.

ADC counts are plotted in Fig. 2(a). The peak at the left corresponds to the

pedestal, whereas the peak on the right gives the integrated charge. From

the ratio of this peak (calibrated as 65 mV) to the charge input(10.5 fC), the

gain of the preamp was calculated to be 6.2 V/pC.

Test with Radioactive Source : We tested two kinds of photodiodes from

Hamamatsu Photonics[11]: S5106 and S2662-03. Active area and capacitance
of S5106(S2662-03) are 5×5 mm2 (7.5×20 mm2) and 40 pF(100 pF), respec-

tively. The preamp was now coupled to the PD at the point shown in Fig. 1.
An 241Am radioactive source was mounted on the PD, and the whole setup

was placed in a light-tight box. The source has a γ–ray peak at 60 keV, which

may sometimes be absorbed completely without any energy leakage by the

300 µm thick depletion layer of the photodiode.

Signals generated by these γ–rays in the PD were ampliﬁed in the preamp,

self-triggered, and integrated by a CAMAC ADC LeCroy 2249A with a gate

4

width of 200 ns.

The 60 keV peak is easily seen with the system. The corresponding pulse-

height spectra for diﬀerent combinations of photodiodes and JFET are shown

in Fig. 2(b), (c) and (d). These ﬁgures are for diﬀerent PDs and diﬀerent

JFETs, as indicated in the respective plots.

Fits to the 60 keV peak and pedestal for all these three combinations of PD

and JFET are given in Table 1.

Calculation of ENC : While working with photodiodes, one often wants to

know the noise or resolution of the system in terms of electron-hole pairs pro-

duced in the PD. Equivalent Niose Charge or ENC represents such a measure.

In Fig. 2(b), for example, width of the peak is 3.29% of the mean(Table 1),

and hence the noise is 3.29% of the signal produced. Since the energy required

to produce an electron-hole pair in silicon is about 3.6 eV, a 60 keV pho-

ton produces 16,667 electrons in the PD. So the noise translates to 16,667 ×

3.29% = 548 electrons, which is the ENC for this system. ENC for the other

two systems are 970 and 906, as posted in Figs. 2(c) and (d), respectively.

It is clear that the conﬁguration of PD S5106 and preamp with JFET 2SK715

renders the least ENC, and hence corresponds to least noise. We therefore

chose this system to measure the scintillation of BGO and BSO crystals.

Estimation of S/N for MIP : A MIP deposits an energy of about 100 MeV

in the length of our BGO crystal. About 300 eV is needed for one scintilla-

tion in pure BGO. Assuming about 20% light collection eﬃciency and 100%

quantum eﬃciency of PD, we end up with about 66,000 electron-hole pairs

created in the PD for a MIP. Since the ENC is 548 electrons, we can expect a

5

signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of about 120 : 1 with our system. For BSO, since

the light output is about one-fourth of BGO, the S/N would be about 30 : 1.

3 BGO and BSO Crystals on MIPs

We experimented on three samples with the same cross-sectional area of 1×1
cm2: (A) 10 cm long BGO crystal from the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry,

Novosibirsk, Russia[12], (B) 12 cm long BGO crystal from the Institute of Sin-

gle Crystal, Ukraine[13], and (C) 12 cm long BSO crystal from Futec Furnace

Co, Japan[14]. Photodiodes(S5106) were glued to one end of crystals with an

optical glue called Eccobond[15]. The crystals were then wrapped hermeti-

cally, ﬁrst with 150 µm teﬂon tapes for better light collection and then with

black tapes, for protection against light leak from outside.

The samples were exposed to a 3.5 GeV π− beam at the π2 beam line at

the KEK-PS. A schematic diagram of the set-up is given in Fig. 3. The e/π

separation in the beam was achieved with a CO2 ˇCerenkov counter. The trigger

was provided by the coincidence of three scintillation counters along the beam.

The pions would then enter the volume of the crystal (and sometimes pass

through the PD, too), and deposit some energy to produce the scintillation

light, which would then be collected by the photodiode. Signal from the PD

was ampliﬁed by the preamp, and was digitized by a CAMAC ADC LeCroy

2249W module with a 4 µsec gate initiated by the trigger. The data was

logged by a Unix workstation-based DAQ system. The crystal glued with PD

and preamp were placed in a light-tight box made up of thick aluminum, which

was electrically grounded, and therefore served as an excellent Faraday cage.

The pedestal was logged concurrently by triggering the DAQ with a clock of

the same gate width, asynchronous with the beam gate.

4 Results and Analysis

MIP Detection : ADC spectra for the three samples A, B and C for the

set-up described above are shown in Figs. 4(a), (b) and (c), respectively. The

ﬁrst peak in each spectrum corresponds to the pedestal, the second one to

the MIP, and the third one to the sum of the MIP and the Nuclear Counter
Eﬀect(NCE) 3 . The third peak thus corresponds to the event where the pion

deposited energy along the length of the crystal, and then hit the photodiode.

The diﬀerence in the second and the third peak corresponds to the amount

of energy deposited in the photodiode itself when a minimum ionizing pion

traverses it. This conjecture was conﬁrmed by a simple calculation of energy

loss and a GEANT[16] simulation indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 4(a).

The simulation is not normalized to the real data, to retain the clarity of the

comparison.

In Fig. 4(d) we show the ADC logged when the crystal is removed from the

setup, i.e., when the beam directly hits the PD. Diﬀerence in ADC counts

between the two peaks corresponds to the signal generated by the NCE. It

may be noted that this diﬀerence is same as the diﬀerence between second

and third peaks in Figs. 4(a),(b) and (c), which conﬁrms that the third peak

3 The Nuclear Counter Eﬀect(NCE) is the extra amount of charge produced in

the photodiode by a charged particle directly hitting it, on the top of the charge

produced by the scintillation light. A MIP, for example, produces about 25000

electron-hole pairs in a photodiode of thickness 300 µm. Nuclear counter eﬀect
worsens the resolution of an EM calorimeter, where some of the secondary e± might

hit the PD. This eﬀect is avoided by using enough radiation lengths of crystal along

the direction of the shower and/or using avalanche photodiodes. For MIP detection,

however, it does not pose a problem as long as the resulting signal due to NCE

is comparable or less than the MIP scintillation signal, which is the case in this

experiment.

in these ﬁgures corresponds to the nuclear counter eﬀect indeed.

It is also apparent from Fig. 4 that sample A has about 40% more light

output than B after correcting for the length, which is not surprising

since they are from diﬀerent manufacturers, and BGO light output is

known to be quite sensitive to production method and trace impurities.

The BSO sample C has about 25% light output compared to BGO sample

A, as already observed in Ref. [4], and one is still able to observe the MIP peak.

Eﬀect of reﬂector : We also studied the advantage of the teﬂon reﬂector

around the crystal. BGO has a high refractive index of 2.15, and therefore is

supposed to retain most of the scintillation light by total internal reﬂection.

We did the following experiment in order to study the eﬀect of putting on

a teﬂon reﬂector around the crystals. First, we stripped the reﬂector oﬀ the

sample B except for the very end opposite to the photodiode(we will call this

setup as “BGO with a reﬂector-cap”). Then the sample was subjected to the
3.5 GeV π− beam. The pulse height spectrum is given in Fig. 5(a) as the solid

line. Then we removed the reﬂector completely, leaving the crystal bare. It

was then subjected to the beam, and the observed pulse-height spectrum is

shown in Fig. 5(a) as the dotted line.

We can easily distinguish the MIP and nuclear counter peaks in these two

superimposed plots. It can be readily seen by comparing the position of the

two MIP peaks after pedestal subtraction, that a reﬂector cap increases the

light collection in BGO by about 30% compared to a bare crystal.

We then took the sample A, completely wrapped with the reﬂector, and sub-

jected it to the beam. The ADC spectrum is plotted in Fig. 5(b) as the solid

line. Then we stripped the reﬂector completely oﬀ the sample, and repeated

8

the experiment. The corresponding ADC spectrum is plotted as the dotted

line in Fig. 5(b).

Again, the peaks due to the MIP and NCE are clearly visible. By comparing

the two MIP peaks after pedestal subtraction, it can be seen that the light

collection with full reﬂector wrap improves by about 85% compared to the

bare crystal.

It is interesting to note that (Fig. 5) the height of the NCE peak with respect

to the MIP peak is smaller for sample B compared to that for sample A.

The reason may be ascribed to the larger length of sample B, where more

scintillation light is collected by the PD, thereby pulling down the ratio.

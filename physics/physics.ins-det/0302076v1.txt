Abstract

We investigate the gas gain behaviour and the energy resolution of a triple-GEM
conﬁguration in gas mixtures of argon, krypton and xenon with ten and thirty
percent of carbon dioxide at pressures between 1 and 3 bar. Since the signal widths
aﬀect the dead time behaviour of the detector we present signal length measurements
to evaluate the use of the triple-GEM in time-resolved X-ray imaging.

development [3,4] or X-ray imaging detectors [5,6]. Thereby, the GEM is usu-
ally combined with other micro pattern devices like MSGCs [7,8], MGCs [9],
micromegas [10] or MicroCAT [11]. Also the cascade of multiple GEM stages
has been tested extensively [12].

A triple-GEM cascade working as a detector for solar neutrino and dark mat-
ter search has been tested at high pressure of pure noble gases [13,14]. These
kinds of gaseous detectors are operated at temperatures close to the boiling
temperature of the gas. Equivalent to this operation at atmospheric pressure
is the operation with higher pressure (depending on the noble gas used) at
room temperature. High pressure is also desired in photon detection to in-
crease quantum eﬃciency. If pure noble gases are not explicitly needed it is
helpful to add a quench gas fraction of up to some 10 % to the noble gases. This
leads normally to smaller charge diﬀusion, shorter signal lengths and the pos-
sibility to obtain higher gas gains. Examinations of the gas gaining behaviour
of alternative micro pattern devices like MSGCs [15] or the behaviour of a
single GEM/MSGC-combination [16] in noble gas/quench gas environments
show that the maximum gain drops with pressure.

The aim of the subsequent investigations is to test the performance of a triple-
GEM detector at higher pressures of dense noble gas/quench gas mixtures to
increase the quantum eﬃciency for photon detection in the energy range of
8
24 keV. We investigate the gas gain behaviour and energy resolution at
diﬀerent pressures and quench gas fractions. We examine the signal lengths
which mainly aﬀect the dead time. Besides space charge eﬀects the dead time
limits the rate capability.

2 Detector setup

The schematic setup of the triple-GEM constellation is shown in Fig. 1. The
6 cm2 are glued under slight
individual GEM foils with dimensions of 6
tension to a 1 mm thick ceramic frame. The GEM type is characterised by
a hole pitch of 140 µm and an optical transparency of 12 %; the thickness of
the GEM amounts to 60 µm including two copper layers of 5 µm each and a
Kapton foil of 50 µm thickness.

×

We have decided to use a distance between the GEMs of 2 mm. The lowermost
GEM is mounted at a distance of 1 mm above the readout structure. Following
the usual nomenclature we denote the applied electric ﬁeld between the GEMs
by transfer ﬁeld and the ﬁeld between the lowermost GEM and the readout
structure by induction ﬁeld. Above the GEM conﬁguration a drift cage is
mounted which provides a homogeneous drift ﬁeld in the conversion region
above the uppermost GEM with a depth of 27 mm.

The 1 mm thick carbon ﬁbre entrance window of the pressure vessel accepts
pressures up to about 3 bar. To achieve high quantum eﬃcieny for photon
14 keV xenon is preferably used (compare
detection in the energy range of 5
to Fig. 2). For photons in the energy range between about 14 and 24 keV
quantum eﬃciency increases using krypton.

3 Gas gain measurements

In the following section we present results of gas gain measurements in the
triple-GEM conﬁguration. The eﬀective gas gain Geﬀ is deﬁned as the product
of the real gas gain GGEM and the electron transparencies ε1-GEM and ε2-GEM
of all GEMs [11]:

Geﬀ =

ε1-GEM-i ε2-GEM-i GGEM-i ,

(1)

3

Yi=1

where ε1-GEM-i is the probability, that the electrons, coming from the drift/conversion
region, reach the multiplication region in the centre of a hole in GEM #i;
ε2-GEM-i is the probability, that these electrons reach the subjacent GEM or
anode. The eﬀective gain Geﬀ is experimentally determined by the quotient of
the measured current at the anode Ianode and the “incoming” current I0:

The current

Geﬀ =

I0

.

I0 = R e

(3)

is determined by the conversion rate R of the X-ray photons in counting mode
of the detector, by the photon energy Eγ and by the average energy required to
produce one electron-ion pair in the gas W ; e denotes the elementary charge.

In fact, the incoming current I0 is overestimated – at least at small drift ﬁelds
and high gas pressures – because of charge losses due to recombination and
attachment in the conversion region. This eﬀect, which is mainly a three-body
process and therefore increases with the square of the gas pressure, is shown as
an example in Fig. 3 in a Xe/CO2 (90/10) gas mixture at pressures between 1
and 2 bar. At drift ﬁelds larger than about 1000 V/cm the eﬀective pulse height
reaches a plateau. In this region attachment and recombination is negligible
and the incoming current I0 is described correctly by Eq. (3).

(6000

Since the maximum voltage applied to the drift cathode was restricted by the
detector geometry to around
500) V we have chosen a drift ﬁeld of
±
400 V/cm to prevent the detector from sparking at the drift cathode and to
have enough margin to increase more crucial potentials like GEM operation
voltages. The transfer ﬁelds have been chosen to 2500 V/cm, and we have ap-
plied an induction ﬁeld of 3000 V/cm to avoid full discharge propagation [20].
Furthermore, we have set the GEM voltages such, that the uppermost GEM
voltage is 10 % higher than the voltage of the middle GEM; the lowermost
GEM is set to an operation voltage 10 % smaller than the “reference” voltage

of the middle GEM ∆UGEM2. This setting assures minimum discharge rates
[20]. The sum of all applied GEM voltages always amounts to 3 ∆UGEM2.

For illumination with X-ray photons we have used a 55Fe source, emitting
photons with an energy of 5.9 keV and with a rate of 41 kHz collimated to
about 28 mm2.

The gas gain measurements were limited by sparks. We stopped the mea-
surements at spark rates & 2 sparks/min, which is rather an arbitrary limit.
Important, however, is the stable detector operation at slightly lower voltages
and hence lower gas gains.

In the following subsections we compare our results with triple-GEM gas gain
measurements in pure noble gas environments [13,14].

3.1 Gas gain in Ar/CO2 (70/30)

Although argon gas mixtures are not well suited for photon detection in the
energy range above a few tens of keV we have carried out gas gain measure-
ments in Ar/CO2 (70/30) to compare the results to published data and to
our results achieved with Kr- and Xe-mixtures. The measured eﬀective gain is
shown in Fig. 4. The maximum gas gain achievable decreases with pressure.

In comparison, the maximum gain at a pressure of 3 bar is about 10 times
smaller than in pure argon [13] whereas we achieve higher gains at atmospheric
pressure.

3.2 Gas gain in Kr/CO2 mixtures

We have investigated two Kr-mixtures with diﬀerent CO2 fractions of 30 %
(see Fig. 5) and 10 % (see Fig. 6), respectively. In both mixtures the eﬀective
gain exceeds 104 up to pressures of 2 bar. Nevertheless, a quench gas fraction
of 30 % is not well suited for operation at pressures > 2 bar where we obtained
a strong decrease in gas gain to about 200. In contrast to that still large gas

3.3 Gas gain in Xe/CO2 mixtures

The use of Xe-based gas mixtures oﬀers the largest quantum eﬃciency for
photon detection in the energy range between 5 and 14 keV. Results of gas
gain measurements for Xe/CO2 (70/30) and Xe/CO2 (90/10) are shown in
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Like for Ar- and Kr-gas mixtures an amount of 10 % carbon
dioxide enables operation with gas gains > 103 at pressures above 2 bar. High
quencher fractions are also not well suited for pressure operation with xenon.

of 10 % of carbon dioxide which is higher compared to the maximum gain in

3.4 Homogeneity

Theoretically, the relative energy resolution σ(E)/E of any gaseous detector
can be described by the following equation:

σ(E)

 

E !

2

=

a2
E2 +

b2
E

+ c2 ,

(4)

where E denotes the photon energy. Assuming the convolution of independent
contributions all terms in Eq. (4) add quadratically. The ﬁrst term describes
a constant energy-independent contribution to the standard deviation of the
measured energy σ(E), i.e. due to electronic noise of the readout electronics.
The second term is due to statistic ﬂuctuations of the produced number of
charge carriers in the detected charge. The coeﬃcient b in Eq. (4) can be
expressed by b2 = W (F +f ) [21], where W denotes the average energy required
to produce one electron-ion pair in the gas, F the Fano factor [22] and f the
relative variance of the gas gain. Typical values for F are 0.17 in argon [23] and
values between 0.4 and 1 for f in proportional counters [24], depending on gas,
pressure, geometry of the detector and applied electric ﬁelds. Finally, the last
term, which contributes constantly to the relative energy resolution, describes
systematic inﬂuences like recombination or attachment or gain variations due
to variable operating conditions, e.g. pressure variations.

We have measured the local and the global energy resolution of the triple-GEM
constellation at diﬀerent pressures of Ar/CO2 (70/30) (see Fig. 9), where we
deﬁne local energy resolution as the energy resolution obtained by irradiation

with a 55Fe source collimated to 12 mm2. We deﬁne global energy resolution
as the energy resolution obtained by illuminating the whole detector area of
6 cm2. The comparison of local and global energy resolution will mostly
6
aﬀect the third term in Eq. (4) and therefore allows the separation of the
major systematic errors. The mean gas gain in all measurements has been kept
constant to about 5000. During the measurements the gain slightly decreased
as a function of time due to charging of the insulating Kapton in the GEM. A
quantitative description of the inﬂuence of this eﬀect on the measured energy
resolution is diﬃcult because the charging was found to be dependent on
illumination time and position, photon ﬂux and dryness of the Kapton surface.

Both, the local and the global energy resolution deteriorate with increasing
gas pressure, which may be explained as follows:

•
•
•

possible increase of the Fano factor F at higher pressure [25].
increase of the relative variance of the gas gain f .
larger recombination of electrons and ions or attachment to electro-negative
impurities which means that the second and third term in Eq. (4) increase.

The deviations in energy resolution between local and global illumination is
due to several aspects: First, the GEMs, themselves, produce intrinsic gain
inhomogeneities since all holes (and thus the gain) are slightly diﬀerent. Fur-
thermore, the distance between the individual GEMs and the distance between
undermost GEM and anode is not constant over all the detector area, which
leads to transfer and induction ﬁeld inhomogeneities und ﬁnally to variations
in the charge transfer behaviour and in the eﬀective gas gain of the GEM (com-
pare to Eq. (1)). Figure 10 shows the relative eﬀective gain measured along
the vertically centred x-axis. Gain variations of up to 25 % become obvious.

3.5 Discussion

We have measured the gas gain behaviour at diﬀerent pressures of argon,
krypton and xenon with additions of 10 % and 30 % of carbon dioxide. Thereby,
a strong inﬂuence of the quench gas fraction becomes obvious. It is deﬁnitely
a non-trivial task to optimise the quench gas fraction at a given pressure due
to a complicated interplay of these parameters. Generally, the maximum gas
gain of the triple-GEM achievable in slightly quenched nobel gas mixtures is
higher than in pure nobel gases. Higher pressure demands for smaller quench
gas fractions.

The strong inﬂuence of the quencher fraction indicates, that a stable avalanche
process is not only based on electron-induced ionization of gas atoms. The UV-
photons which are produced in the avalanche development may contribute
noticeably to the multiplication procedure. With increasing pressure and con-
stant (or even larger) quench gas fraction the range of the UV-photons is
decreasing. For instance, the deterioration in energy resolution in a MWPC
is stopped when a very small quench gas fraction of only 2 % at very high
pressures (up to 30 bar) is added to argon [26]. However, still smaller fractions
of quenching gas lead to an unsafe operation of the detector.

A good choice for photon detection with the triple-GEM is the use of Xe/CO2
103 can be easily
(90/10) at pressures between 1 and 2 bar. Gas gains of 5
reached without sparking. For still higher pressures of xenon based gas mix-
tures the detector response with a smaller amount (< 10 %) of quenching gas
should be taken into consideration.

4 Signal length investigations

We have studied the dependence of the anode signal shape on GEM voltage,
induction ﬁeld, transfer ﬁeld and drift ﬁeld for all gas mixtures and several
pressures since dead time of the detector is mainly determined by the signals
lengths. The copper readout anode for these measurements has a size of 1
×
1 cm2. The integrating preampliﬁer and the shaper including a pole-zero ﬁlter
to cancel the pole of the integrating ﬁrst stage are in-house developments. The
δ-response of this ampliﬁcation system is gaussian-like with a width of 15 ns
(fwhm) due to bandwidth limitations.

The anode signal shape is mainly determined by two aspects:

(1) A spatially δ-like distributed electron cluster moving from the bottom
side of the undermost GEM towards the readout structure induces a
box-shaped current at both involved electrodes (see box-shaped current
in Fig. 11) if the electric ﬁeld and therefore the electron drift velocity
in the region of interest is assumed to be constant [27]. The copper-clad
bottom side of the GEM shields all currents induced by charge move-
ments appearing above this electrode; especially the slow ions do not
contribute to the signal shape. The crucial parameters for the width of
the box-shaped current are the electron velocity in the electric ﬁeld of the
induction region and the distance between the bottom side of the GEM
and the anode which was set to 1 mm in our case.

(2) The longitudinal diﬀusion σl of the primary produced electrons (photo-
electron plus subsequently produced
300 electrons for 8 keV photons in
argon) in the conversion region leads to a gaussian smearing (see dotted

≈

11

line in Fig. 11) of this box function (convolution result see dashed line in
Fig. 11). The width of the gaussian

σt =

σl0 √l
(cid:18)

(cid:19)

/ve

(5)

is determined by the longitudinal diﬀusion coeﬃcient σl0 and the elec-
tron drift velocity ve in the applied drift ﬁeld and gas mixture used and
ﬁnally by the mean drift path √l of the electrons, which is dependent on
photon energy, maximum drift length and absorption coeﬃcient of the
gas. An additional contribution comes from the longitudinal electron dif-
fusion in the transfer regions between the GEMs. In our simulation this
contribution has also been taken into account.

For most gas mixtures and pressures in our detector setup diﬀusion spread-
ing is the main contribution so that the signal shape is very much gaussian-
like. Due to this gaussian signal shape and the gaussian δ-response of the
preampliﬁer/shaper-system the real signal length can be calculated to be the
width of the deconvolution of both gaussians:

where ∆ is the full width half maximum of the signal. In case the measured
signal shape is not gaussian (which means that the main contribution of the
signal is due to the electron induced box-shaped current) Eq. (6) is no longer
valid. But in this case the measured signal width is very much larger than the
width of the δ-response (∆sig-meas
∆δ-response) and therefore the real signal
width can be determined to be ∆sig-real
We have measured the full width half maximum (fwhm) of the anode signals
and the δ-response with a digital oscilloscope, afterwards averaging the widths
of several signals. All measurements have been performed with a transfer ﬁeld
of 2500 V/cm and an induction ﬁeld of 3000 V/cm if not noted otherwise. The
55Fe source has been collimated to about 12 mm2; photons were emitted with
a rate of a few hundred Hz. We have carried out all signal width simulations
only for 1 bar Ar/CO2 (70/30), where experimental data on drift velocities
[28] and simulated data on longitudinal diﬀusion [29,30] have been used.

4.1 Inﬂuence of GEM operation voltage

No inﬂuence of the GEM voltage on the signal length has been measured. The
range of the investigated GEM voltages was limited by the dynamic range
of the preampliﬁer. Anyway, the setting of the GEM voltage is determined
by the desired gas gain and is therefore no freely adjustable parameter for
optimisation of the signal lengths.

4.2 Inﬂuence of the induction ﬁeld

The contribution of the width of the box-shaped current to the total width of
the signal increases for very small induction ﬁelds because of the decreasing
electron drift velocity. Three-dimensional ﬁeld calculations with Maxwell [31]
using a geometry of 1 mm transfer gap, the GEM foil and 1 mm induction gap
(the geometry of the GEM and more simulation details are described in Ref.
[11]) show that the electric ﬁeld in the induction region along the symmetry
axis of a GEM hole is larger than the quotient E = UGEM-bottom/d of the
applied voltage on the bottom side of the GEM UGEM-bottom and the distance
d between GEM bottom and anode. This eﬀect is some relict due to the very
high electric ﬁeld in the holes. The calculated width of the electron induced
box-shaped current is determined by introducing a constant electron mobility
10−3 cm2/(Vµs) for electric ﬁelds up to
for 1 bar Ar/CO2 (70/30) as µe = 3
2 kV/cm and a constant velocity of ve = 6 cm/µs for electric ﬁelds > 2 kV/cm.
This model is a coarse parametrisation of measured electron drift velocities
[28]. From the hereby determined electron velocities a mean drift velocity
in the induction region is calculated. The results of this simulation and the
comparison to experiment is shown in Fig. 12. A good agreement becomes
obvious. The deviation at induction ﬁelds between 500 V/cm and 1500 V/cm
are probably due to the coarse electron drift velocity parametrisation. At
induction ﬁelds larger than about 2000 V/cm the inﬂuence of the box-shaped
current becomes negligible compared to the contribution of the longitudinal
electron diﬀusion in the conversion region.

most and the middle and between the middle and the undermost GEM in 1 and
1.5 bar Xe/CO2 (90/10) with a constant drift ﬁeld of Edrift = 1000 V/cm.

4.3 Inﬂuence of the transfer ﬁeld

The measured results are shown in Fig. 13. Transfer ﬁelds smaller than 2500 V/cm
result in a slight increase of the signal width which can be explained by a
larger longitudinal diﬀusion contribution from the transfer regions between
the GEMs due to smaller electron drift velocities (compare to Eq. (5)). At
larger transfer ﬁelds the signal width reaches a plateau.

4.4 Inﬂuence of the drift ﬁeld

This section contains an intensive investigation of the inﬂuence of the applied
drift ﬁeld on the signal width.

The comparison between measurement and simulation (see Fig. 14) shows a
good agreement for drift ﬁelds & 200 V/cm. It turned out that signal width
measurements at small drift ﬁelds are very diﬃcult because the signal shape
is not continuous. It is rather divided into single electron clusters reaching
the anode one by one (see Fig. 15). Therefore, the error is relatively large
when determining the signal length. Furthermore, a large part of the primary
produced electrons is lost due to recombination and attachment at low drift
ﬁelds (compare to Fig. 3) thus increasing the inﬂuence of noise. For larger
drift ﬁelds the measured signal shape becomes continuous and smooth (see
Fig. 16).

The measured signal widths for diﬀerent gas mixtures and gas pressures are
shown in Fig. 17–21. Generally, high drift ﬁelds are needed to produce short

1200 V/cm due to sparking at the
signals. We were limited to about 1000
drift cathode. The fastest signals with a signal length of < 25 ns (fwhm) are
produced in the argon mixture at standard pressure (see Fig. 17). Larger pres-
sure always increases the signal width because of decreasing drift velocities.
But even in 1.5 bar Xe/CO2 (90/10) the signal width does not exceed 60 ns
(fwhm) at a drift ﬁeld of 1100 V/cm.

4.5 Discussion

In our detector setup the drift ﬁeld has the most crucial inﬂuence on the
signal length although for smaller conversion regions this parameter becomes
less important due to smaller longitudinal electron diﬀusion. The drift ﬁeld
should be chosen as large as allowed by the detector setup. However, the drift

17

ﬁeld should not be too high (. 2 kV/cm) because the uppermost GEM loses
transparency for too high drift ﬁelds [12]. The GEM operation voltage, which
is mainly determined by the desired gas gain, does not inﬂuence the signal
widths visibly. Transfer and induction ﬁelds & 2 kV/cm minimise the widths
of the signal. If the contribution of the electron induced box-shaped current
(see Fig. 11) becomes noticeable the distance between the undermost GEM
and the anode can be reduced, i.e. to 0.5 mm. This should suppress this eﬀect.

5 Conclusion

We have measured the gas gain in a triple-GEM geometry for pressures up to
3 bar of Ar/CO2 (70/30), Kr/CO2 (70/30), Kr/CO2 (90/10), Xe/CO2 (70/30)
and Xe/CO2 (90/10). At a pressure of > 2 bar the addition of 10 % of carbon
dioxide to the noble gases leads to higher maximum gas gains compared to
pure noble gases. Too large amounts of quench gas disturbs operation at high
pressure and is therefore not preferable. Generally, we have obtained that the
quench gas fraction should decrease with pressure.

The measured signal lengths at high drift ﬁelds are in all gas mixtures in-
vestigated smaller than about 100 ns (fwhm). If transfer and induction ﬁelds
exceed 2 kV/cm the signal widths get to mimimum.

Further optimisation with respect to an increased high rate behaviour can
be performed with exact knowledge of photon energy and desired quantum
eﬃciency. For example, with a desired quantum eﬃcieny of 90 % for 8 keV-
photons in 1.5 bar Xe/CO2 (90/10) it is suﬃcient to have a maximum drift
length of 11 mm with mean drift path
(see Fig. 22) instead of 27 mm

√l11

with mean drift path
used for measurements described in this paper.
The longitudinal diﬀusion and consequently the signal width will thus decrease
by a factor of √l27 / √l11

In combination with the resistive readout structure it is proposed to integrate
about 90 % of the charge to achieve optimum spatial resolution [18]. Compared
to the signal length fwhm, presented here, the charge integration time from 5 %
to 95 % of the original signal can be calculated to be τ5−95 %
1.4 τfwhm. Due
to charge diﬀusion on the readout structure the charge integration time for
signals with a width of τ5-95 % = 92 ns is stretched to about τrs:5-95 % = 150 ns.
Compared to the geometry of MicroCAT- or micromegas-detectors the triple-
GEM constellation oﬀers faster signals since only the electrons and not the
slow ions contribute to the signal shape.

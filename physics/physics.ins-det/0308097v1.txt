Abstract

We report on the performance of a micro-TPC with a micro pixel chamber(µ-
PIC) readout for a time-resolved neutron position-sensitive detector(PSD). Three-
dimensional tracks and the Bragg curves of protons with energies of around 1 MeV
were clearly detected by the micro-TPC. More than 95% of gamma-rays of 511
keV were found to be discriminated by simple analysis. Simulation studies showed
that the total track length of proton and triton emitted from the 3He(n,p(573
keV))3H(191keV) reaction is about 1.2 cm, and that both particles have large en-
ergy losses (> 200keV/cm) in 1 atm Ar+C2H6(10%)+3He(< 1%). These values suit
the current performance of the micro-TPC, and we conclude that a time-resolved
neutron PSD with spatial resolution of sub-millimeters shall be developed as an
application of the micro-TPC.

1 Introduction

Micro-TPC, a time projection chamber with a micro pixel chamber (µ-PIC)
readout was recently developed for the detection of charged particles[1]. The
results of a fundamental measurement indicate that some improvements are
still required for detecting the minimum ionizing particles (MIPs)[2]. Never-
theless, the results also indicate that low-energy charged particles, which have
a large energy loss (dE/dx), are already detectable by the micro-TPC with
dense samplings.

Neutron position-sensitive detectors (PSDs) with a large detection area and a
capacity for high-rate operation are indispensable for use at neutron beams of
the next generation[3]. Since the neutron energy is resolved by a measurement
of the time-of-ﬂight(TOF), a timing measurement on the order of µs is strictly
required. Gaseous neutron detectors ﬁlled with 3He have been keenly devel-
oped and used because of large cross section to thermal neutrons of about
25 meV. Because the energy losses of both the proton and the triton emitted
from the 3He (n, p (573 keV)) 3H(191keV) reaction are large, we expect to
detect the ﬁne tracks of both particles by the micro-TPC. We can thus deter-
mine the incident position from the detected tracks with a resolution of sub-
millimeters. Since gamma-rays are thought to make a large background when
used at neutron beams, discrimination between the neutrons and gamma-rays
is also important, which should be realized by the measured values, such as
the energy losses (dE/dx).

In this paper, we present the tracking performance of the micro-TPC with
energies of around 1 MeV. We then report on the discrimination between the
electron tracks (gamma-ray events) and the proton tracks (neutron events).
Finally, we discuss the development of time-resolved thermal neutron (∼ 25
meV) PSD as an application of the micro-TPC while taking account of the
experimental results and simulation studies.

2 Micro-TPC

A micro-TPC, a time projection chamber with a micro pixel chamber(µ-
PIC[4]) readout, was recently developed for the detection of charged particles[1,2].
µ-PIC is a gaseous two-dimensional PSD manufactured by printed circuit
board(PCB) technology. A schematic of the µ-PIC structure is shown in Fig. 1.
We developed a µ-PIC with a detection area of 10 × 10 cm2 and a pixel pitch
of 400 µm. Cathode strips are formed on one side of a polyimide substrate
(100 µm thick), while anode strips are orthogonally formed on the other side.

2

The results of a fundamental measurement have already been reported in
a previous paper[2]. Here, we brieﬂy mention the essential features of the
micro-TPC[1]. The detection volume of the micro-TPC is 10 × 10 × 8cm3
with a drift ﬁeld of 0.4kV/cm. The micro-TPC can be stably operated at a
gas gain of 3000 with Ar-C2H6(10%) ﬂow. We are optimizing the geometrical
structure of the pixels using a three-dimensional simulator[5,6] in order to
realize a stable operation with a gas gain of 104. The signal from each strip
is fed to an ampliﬁer-shaper-discriminator (ASD[7]) chip, which outputs both
an ampliﬁed analog signal and a discriminated digital (LVDS) signal. LVDS
signals are in turn read by a position encoding module (PEM), which works at
a clock rate of 20 MHz. PEM calculates the two-dimensional incident position
while taking the anode-cathode coincidence within one clock pulse. When at
least one anode-cathode coincidence is found within the maximum drift time
(2 µs) from the external trigger, or the ”t = 0” time, the two-dimensional
position and the elapsed time from the trigger are recorded. For the energy
measurement, every 32 analog outputs of the cathode ASD chips are summed
and digitized by an 8-channel 100 MHz ﬂash ADC (FADC). In this way, we can
realize three-dimensional tracking and spectroscopy of the charged particles
with the micro-TPC.

3 Measurements

3.1 Proton tracking

We irradiated the micro-TPC with fast neutrons from a radioactive 252Cf(∼2MBq)
source, the neutron energy of which peaks between 500 keV and 1 MeV.
Protons arise from elastic neutron scattering by hydrogen nuclei in C2H6.
Part of the neutron kinetic energy is transferred to the hydrogen nucleus, i.e.
the proton. The radioactive source was placed 8.5 cm from the aluminum
window of the micro-TPC, and an Yttrium Aluminum Perovskite (YAP)
scintillator[8](1”× 1” φ) was set 3 cm from the radioactive source at the
opposite side of the micro-TPC. The set-up is shown in Fig. 2. One ﬁssion
decay of 252Cf emits 3.8 neutrons and 9.7 photons on average, therefore, the
micro-TPC was triggered by gamma-rays detected by the YAP scintillator.
The three-dimensional tracking performance for protons of around 1 MeV
and a gamma-ray background of several hundred keV were thus measured in
this ”n/γ-run”.

From all of the measured data, we selected data with a length >1cm and
Nhit ≥4 as the track data. Here, length is the track length calculated by
simply connecting the detected points, and Nhit is the number of detected
points.

Several proton tracks with energies between 500 keV and 1 MeV are shown in
Fig. 3. The hardware threshold level at the ASD chip was 50 keV/cm, which
was low enough to detect sub-MeV protons having energy losses larger than
200 keV/cm. Therefore, the detection eﬃciency was estimated to be almost
100%. In Fig. 4, FADC waveforms of the proton tracks are shown. Here, the
same events are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Since the elapsed time from the
trigger represents the drift length, these waveforms are regarded as the Bragg
curves. The directions of the tracks are obviously known from the shape of
the Bragg curves.

From measurements with 252Cf, the micro-TPC was found to possess suﬃcient
performance to detect the tracks and Bragg curves of protons with energies of
around 1 MeV.

3.2 Particle discrimination

Since gamma-rays are thought to make a large background when used at
neutron beams, discrimination between the neutrons and gamma-rays is im-
portant. We measured the particle discrimination power by irradiating the
micro-TPC with gamma-rays from a radioactive source of 22Na. Annihilated
back-to-back gamma-rays of 511 keV were emitted from the source. The micro-
TPC was triggered by one of the gamma-rays detected by a YAP scintillator,
while the other scattered the electrons in the micro-TPC. This radioactive
source was chosen because the gamma-ray energy is close to the Q value (764
keV) of the 3He (n, p) 3H reaction. Thus, the particle discrimination of the 511
keV gamma-rays was measured in this ”γ-run”. Since the dE/dx of electrons
scattered by the gamma-rays were much smaller than those of the neutrons,
analog signals were ampliﬁed by the gain ampliﬁer((gain = 8) before being
digitized by the FADC in the γ-run.

The typical three-dimensional track of the electron (gamma-ray event) is
shown in Fig. 5. Comparing the tracks in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5, one ﬁnds that
the proton tracks are more dense and straight than those of the electrons.
Consequently, one can assume that the discrimination of the proton tracks
and the electron tracks are realized by the energy loss and the ﬁtting results
with straight lines. We deﬁned the energy loss by dE/dx = E/length and χ2
by

χ2 = X

i=1,2,n−1,n

∆i
σ

,

(1)

where E is the detected energy, n is the number of detected points, ∆i is the
distance between the ith detected point and the best-ﬁt straight line, and σ =

4

270µm is the measured three-dimensional spatial resolution of the micro-TPC.
The degree of freedom (d.o.f) was three for all of the tracks, since we used the
ﬁrst two and the last two points to calculate χ2. The dE/dx distributions of
the n/γ-run and the γ-run are shown in Fig. 6. In the data of the γ-run, most
events are distributed below 50 keV/cm. On the other hand, neutron events
with dE/dx > 50 keV/cm can be seen in the n/γ-run as well as the gamma-
ray peak below 50 keV/cm. The χ2/d.o.f distributions are shown in Fig. 7.
χ2/d.o.f distribution of the n/γ-run peaks below 3, because the proton tracks
are ﬁtted with the straight lines very well. We thus deﬁne the ”neutron region”
by dE/dx >50 keV/cm and χ2/d.o.f< 3. When we consider the selection
eﬃciency of the neutrons, the lower limit for the energy loss (dE/dx =50
keV/cm) is reasonably low compared to the energy losses (> 200keV/cm) of
the protons and tritons from the 3He(n,p)3H reaction. It is apparent that the
χ2 cut has a very high eﬃciency from the steep peak in Fig. 7. Therefore, the
selection eﬃciency for the neutron is thought to be very close to 100%.

Fig. 8 shows χ2/d.o.f. vs dE/dx plots of the n/γ-run. Neutron events can be
seen in the neutron region, while the gamma-ray events are seen out of the
neutron region. The result of the γ-run is shown in Fig. 9. Only less than 5%
of the total events (14 of 500 events) are seen in the neutron region, which
indicates that more than 95% of the gamma-rays are discriminated by this
analysis.

In this measurement with a 22Na radioactive source, more than 95% of the
511 keV gamma-ray background is known to be discriminated by the dE/dx
and the χ2.

4 Time-resolved neutron PSD with the micro-TPC

4.1 Time-resolved neutron PSD with the micro-TPC

Neutron position-sensitive detectors(PSDs) with a large detection area and a
capacity for high-rate operation are indispensable for use at neutron beams
of the next generation[3]. Since the neutron energy is resolved by a measure-
ment of a time-of-ﬂight(TOF), the timing measurement on the order of µs is
strictly required. Gaseous neutron detectors ﬁlled with 3He have been keenly
developed and used because of the large cross section to thermal neutrons of
about 25 meV. Recently, a CCD-GEM based 3He detector was developed, and
the performance was studied[9]. Nice images of the tracks of the proton and
triton were obtained, which indicates the potential for the thermal-neutron
PSD. However, making a large-area detector and high-rate operation could be
problematic for practical use at neutron beams. In addition, the CCD readout

5

is too slow for the TPC; hence, only two-dimensional tracks are achieved in
this readout system. This feature would deteriorate the quality of the neutron
images.

On the other hand, the micro-TPC with a large detection area is easily manu-
factured and high-rate operation up to 7.7 MHz with the µ-PIC was actually
realized[2]. Three-dimensional trackings help to determine the incident po-
sition with a spatial resolution of sub-millimeters. Fine spatial resolution is
strictly required for the neutron diﬀraction imaging, because the incident an-
gle is determined by the incident position. Therefore, the micro-TPC is an
appropriate detector for time-resolved neutron PSD with 3He. The principle
of the 3He neutron detector is 3He (n, p (573 keV)) 3H(191keV). We have
already shown that the micro-TPC possess suﬃcient performance to detect
the tracks and Bragg curves of the proton emitted from this reaction. We sub-
sequently studied the tracks of both particles by a simulation, and evaluated
the development of the time-resolved thermal neutron (∼ 25 meV) PSD as an
application of the micro-TPC.

We calculated the energy depositions of protons and tritons along the tracks
by Geant4 (ver 5.0 patch-01)[10]. A gas mixture of Ar-C2H6(10%)-3He(< 1%)
at 1 atm was used for the calculation. We did not take account of the ionization
of 3He for the energy deposition because its amount is vary small. The result
is shown in Fig. 10. The track length (1.2cm) and the dE/dx of both particles
(> 200 keV/cm) are reasonable for detection by the micro-TPC. The protons
and the tritons are easily distinguished from the Bragg curves. As a result, the
incident position is determined with a spatial resolution of sub-millimeters.

From a measurement with a 22Na source, more than 95% of the 511 keV
gamma-ray background was known to be discriminated by dE/dx and χ2. For
practical use, the total energy deposition (E) is also used to discriminate the
low energy gamma-rays that have large dE/dx. With this total energy cut,
almost complete gamma-ray rejection will be realized. In this way, we reject
the gamma-ray background almost completely, which is another appropriate
feature of the neutron PSD as an application of the micro-TPC.

This neutron PSD is operated with the gas at normal pressure. We can thus
reduce the materials needed for the high-pressure gas enclosure, which is useful
for a better image of the neutrons.

From simulation studies and the experimental results, we conclude that a
time-resolved neutron PSD with a spatial resolution of sub-millimeters shall
be developed as an application of the micro-TPC.

4.2 Future plans

We are developing a µ-PIC with a detection area of 30 × 30 cm2. We will
soon increase the clock rate of the encoding system from 20 MHz to 100 MHz,
because the current spatial resolution is dominated by this clock rate. With
these improvements, we are quite sure that we can develop a time-resolved
neutron PSD as an aplication of the micro-TPC.

The parallax error could be problematic for a non-pressurized 8cm-thick TPC.
One solution to avoid it is to build a curved detector so that one of the two
parallax errors will not be observed. Because the µ-PIC is a thin (∼100µm)
polyimide sheet, curved detectors can, in principle, be manufactured. An-
other solution is to determine the start timing of the drift by detecting the
gas scintillation light so that the interaction position would be determined
three-dimensionally with a resolution of sub-millimeters. The study on the
gas scintillation seems to be one of the most important tasks of ours in the
near future development. CF4 gas, which is a common gas for the 3He neutron
detector because of its large stopping power (for shorter tracks) and small Z
(for less gamma-ray background), would also be useful for this purpose, be-
cause its scintillation wavelength ﬁts the detection by the photomultipliers[11].
Total light yield from the CF4 gas by the neutron capture reaction of 3He is
estimated to be O(103) photons, which seems to be enough to trigger the
TPC with a timing resolution of ∼10ns even with a photomultiplier coverage
of a few % and its quantum eﬃciency of ∼ 10% at 600nm. In this way, we
think the parallax error could be avoided with some more improvements of
the micro-TPC.

The results on the tracking performance and the particle discrimination indi-
cate a strong possibility the application of the micro-TPC as a dark matter
detector. Actually, our results are comparable to those shown in Ref. [12] con-
cerning the points of tracking performance and discrimination. We are going to
study the detector response to low-energy nuclear recoils in order to estimate
the feasibility for a dark matter detector.

5 Conclusions

Three-dimensional tracks and the Bragg curves of the protons with energies
of around 1 MeV were clearly detected by the micro-TPC. We also showed
that more than 95% gamma-rays of the 511 keV were discriminated, while the
eﬃciency to the neutrons of the same energy range was retained at ∼100%.
Simulation studies showed that the total track length of the proton and the
triton emitted from the 3He(n,p(573 keV))3H(191keV) reaction is about 1.2

7

cm, and that both particles have suﬃcient energy losses (> 200keV/cm) in 1
atm Ar+C2H6(10%)+3He(< 1%). These values suit the current performance
of the micro-TPC, and we conclude that a time-resolved neutron PSD with
a spatial resolution of sub-millimeters shall be developed as an application of
the micro-TPC.

Abstract

A photomultiplier setup for precise relative CsI(Tl) crystal light
yield and uniformity measurements is described. It is used for wrap-
ping material studies to optimize the uniformity and the yield of the
light output of 36 cm long crystals. The uniformity is an important
property in high energy photon calorimetry. Results of an optimiza-
tion of photodiode coupling to crystals, the inﬂuence of temperature
and radiation damage to light and photoelectron yield are also pre-
sented.

1 Introduction

Although Thallium doped CsI crystals are widely used in high energy physics
detectors [1, 2], new precision experiments at the B-meson factories presently
under construction [3, 4] rely on CsI(Tl) calorimeters with improved energy
resolution, electronic noise, and crystal radiation hardness. The energy res-
olution at low energies is inﬂuenced by the (temperature dependent) crystal
light yield, which should be stable over long time periods and maximized to
achieve low electronic noise [3]. Because of ﬂuctuations of electromagnetic
showers in the crystals it is necessary to know and to optimize the unifor-
mity of light output. Related studies can be found in the literature [5, 6, 7],
but there are often descrepancies between laboratory studies performed with
photomultipliers and the actual photodiode readout used in calorimeters.
One reason is the very diﬀerent sensitivity of both readout devices at the
wavelength of the CsI(Tl) scintillation light.

We will limit ourselves to investigations which are relevant for large high
energy physics calorimeters. After introducing setups, which allow compara-
ble and precise crystal measurements with photomultipliers and photodiodes,
we describe a method to improve the crystal light yield and response unifor-
mity. Using light yield optimized crystals we studied several ways to couple
photodiodes to crystals and to enhance the photoelectron yield thereby min-
imizing the equivalent electronic noise energy. Since temperature and radi-
ation can alter the crystal light yield, their inﬂuence was investigated with
both readout setups. These investigations were performed as part of early
studies for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the BABAR detector.

2 Experimental Setup

The CsI(Tl) crystals used in this study were supplied by Monokristal/Khar-
kov (Ukraine). Their Thallium content amounts to ∼ 0.08 mol%. The crys-
tals were slightly tapered with a front face of 6×5 cm2, rear face dimensions of
6 ×6 cm2, and a length of 36 cm, which corresponds to 19.4 radiation lengths.

2.1 Photomultiplier Readout

The scintillation light of CsI(Tl) with a peak emission wavelength at ∼
550 nm was read out using a Hamamatsu R669 photomultiplier tube with
a multialkali photocathode (5 cm diameter), which has an enhanced sensitiv-
ity in this wavelength range [8, 9]. The photomultiplier, which was coupled
to the crystals via a minimal airgap, was operated at 1 kV (anode grounded),
and read out by AC coupling to an Ortec preampliﬁer model 113 with an
input capacity of 1 nF. A spectroscopic ampliﬁer, Ortec model 672, provided
a Gaussian shaping with 1 µs time constant and an additional ampliﬁcation.
A peak sensitive ADC, Ortec 800, was DC coupled to the ampliﬁer in order
to avoid an additional diﬀerentiation of the pulse at the ADC input. For
pile-up rejection the corresponding signal from the shaping ampliﬁer was fed
into the ADC. A PC based multichannel analyzer from Target with the cor-
responding TMCA software was used for data acquisition.

For position dependent measurements of the light output, a radioactive
γ source with a lead collimator was moved along the length of the crystal.
The energy of the γ source, the collimator outer dimensions, and the pin-hole
diameter of the collimator were optimized in order to get a focused illumi-
nation at the crystal surface and a suﬃcient penetration depth. Finally the
collimator was laid out as an almost half-sphere with 5 cm radius and a pin-
hole diameter of 6 mm. It was located 1 cm above the crystal surface and
contained a 137Cs source with 1 µCi and 662 keV γ energy. These parameters
resulted in a mean spot diameter at the crystal surface of ∼ 2 cm as shown
in Fig. 1.

A step-width of 2 cm was chosen for the motorized translation stage mov-
ing the collimator because of the spot size. At each collimator position a
dead-time corrected spectrum was taken for 100 seconds, resulting in a total
measurement time of about half an hour for 18 positions along the crystal.
The region of the photopeak was ﬁt to the sum of a Gaussian distribution
and an exponential background. In order to quote a crystal light yield, the 18
peak positions were averaged and related to the position of the corresponding
peak for a small cubic CsI(Tl) crystal (25 mm on an edge). This standard
crystal was remeasured regularly. Thus, total light yield LY values given in
this article are relative to this standard crystal.

For precise measurements of diﬀerent crystals, independent of photomul-

tiplier drift, gain variations, and environmental inﬂuences, two diﬀerent mon-
itoring systems were developed. One consisted of an 241Am source placed on
a small hole in the crystal wrapping material at the front end of the crys-
tal. This source emits α-particles with an energy of about 5.4 MeV, which
generate a constant amount of scintillation light in the crystal. Fig. 2 shows
a pulse height spectrum of a 137Cs γ-source with a 241Am α-source as ref-
erence attached to a large crystal. When the crystal is scanned with the
137Cs γ-source, the variations of the position of the α-peak indicate drift of
the electronics during the uniformity measurement, which is corrected during
the analysis [10]. For this monitoring method, the error of the peak position
was ±0.3% for spectra taken along one crystal, mainly due to the description
of the background. However, the error for the total light yield of a particular
crystal is much larger, since the α-line position may vary from crystal to
crystal owing to variations in light generation and transmission. Therefore,
an external reference system was developed and operated under stable and

controlled conditions.

This system used a “light normal” consisting of an encapsulated combi-
nation of a NaI(Tl) crystal and a 241Am source. Since the light output of this
crystal is low, its light cannot directly be coupled to the R669 photomulti-
plier. Instead, it is detected by another photomultiplier (Philips RCA 8575),
which is in addition illuminated by a green LED. The LED is pulsed by an
adjustable voltage and frequency. This setup is located in a light tight, tem-
perature stabilized box. A ﬁxed fraction of the LED light is fed, via a 3 m
long glass ﬁber with negligible temperature dependence, into the entrance
window of the R669 photomultiplier which measures the CsI(Tl) crystals. A
sketch of the setup is shown in Fig. 3. Variations in the LED light and in the
gain of the photomultiplier of the reference system are corrected by the out-
put of the light normal. In this way an error of better than 0.3% for the total
crystal light yield was achieved and veriﬁed by long-term comparisons of a
few crystals. At this level of accuracy, the temperature dependence of the
crystal light yield becomes important. Therefore the crystals were located

material. The light yield for each crystal was corrected by the measured
temperature dependence of the light output (see section 4).

2.2 Photodiode Readout

For the light readout by photodiodes, radioactive sources of higher photon
energy are required. We have chosen 88Y with Eγ = 898 keV and 1836 keV.
The scintillation light is read out by two PIN silicon photodiodes coupled to
the crystal rear. Two diﬀerent types of photodiodes from Hamamatsu were
used, S 2744-08 with an active window size of 10 × 20 mm2 for direct readout
and S 3588-03 (mod 5400) with an active area of 3 × 30 mm2 for wavelength
shifter readout. These types have an active layer of 300 µm thickness and
are SiN passivated. The diodes are operated with a reverse bias voltage of
−60 V with the cathode grounded. Typical values for the dark current of
3 nA and for the capacity of 85 pF (45 pF) are reported by the manufacturer
for the types S 2744-08 and S 3588-03 (mod 5400), respectively. We mea-
sured the dark current of an initial sample of 110 diodes of type S 2744-08

in a temperature controlled environment using a Keithley pA-meter to be
(2.8 ± 0.5) nA. The same device was used for a measurement of the diode
capacity. Thereto a rectangular generator was set up using the diode as a
capacitor determining the frequency of the generator. This frequency was
converted into a voltage which was measured as a current over a 5 MΩ resis-
tor. The result was (83.4 ± 0.7) pF for 110 diodes. The quantum eﬃciency
of both types are 85% (90%) at 560 nm (650 nm) [11].

The optical coupling of the diodes to the crystal was varied and will be
described in section 3.3. The photoelectron yields of both photodiodes were
measured individually by independent electronic readout chains [12, 13]. In
order to amplify the small pulses typically between 5000 and 8000 photo-
electrons for a γ source energy of 1.8 MeV, charge sensitive preampliﬁers,
Canberra 2003T, were coupled via short co-axial cables to the diodes. Crys-
tal, photodiodes, and preampliﬁers were located in a light tight box which
also provided an electromagnetic shield. From the preamp output each sig-
nal was fed into a spectroscopic shaping ampliﬁer, Canberra AFT 2025, with
2 µs (Gaussian) shaping time and ﬁnally DC coupled into a peak sensitive
ADC, Montedel Laben model 8215. The pile-up output of the ampliﬁers was
connected to the corresponding ADC input. The ADC are read out with the
same TMCA based DAQ system as used for the photomultiplier setup. The
photopeak regions in both pulse-height spectra were ﬁt with a combination
of a Gaussian and an exponential in order to determine the peak position.

The ADC channel scale was calibrated in absolute electric charge by using
the photodiodes as solid state detectors. The peak position for 59.5 keV pho-
tons from a 241Am source, directly located at the photodiode, was measured.
Those photons, when absorbed in the silicon layer, create one electron-hole
pair per 3.6 eV deposited photon energy. Therefore, the mean peak position
of the photon line, which was determined by a ﬁt of a Gaussian and a linear
background in the peak region, corresponds to 16480 created photoelectrons.
Thus the photoelectron yield PY of a crystal - photodiode combination, with
dimensions e0/ MeV, can be determined by the ratio of peak positions of
scintillation light and photon conversion in the diode according to

Typical spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The photoelectron yields of both diodes

to quote the photoelectron yield of the crystal - diodes setup. This method
allowed the measurement of photoelectron yields in a wide range with an ac-
curacy of ±100 e0/ MeV. The crystals used for this study had photoelectron
yields between 5000 and 9000 e0/ MeV.

yield at a given position from the average yield in percent. In case of the

2.3 Comparison of Photomultiplier and Photodiode

Readout

In order to compare the uniformity of a crystal determined with diﬀerent
readout devices as well as to relate the light yield measured with the pho-
tomultiplier setup and the photoelectron yield measured with photodiode
readout, a uniformity scan with both setups was performed. Since the pho-
ton energy of 137Cs is too low to determine the photopeak position with
photodiodes, the 1275 keV line of 22Na was used with a modiﬁed collimator
consisting of two 5 × 10 × 18 cm3 lead blocks with a 5 mm wide gap. The
source was placed in this gap 8 cm above the crystal surface. The crystal,
wrapped in two layers of Tyvek 1056D and 5 µm aluminized mylar foil (see
section 3.1), was ﬁrst scanned with the setup described in section 2.1 and
then with the modiﬁed collimator and the 22Na source, which gave identical
results within the measurement errors for light yield and uniformity. Finally,
two photodiodes S 2744-08 were glued to a 1mm thick lucite plate, which in
turn was glued to the center of the crystal rear face. The remaining rear area
of the crystal was covered with a reﬂector, also consisting of Tyvek 1056D.
The scan was repeated with the same stepwidth, but using the photodiode

readout electronics. Fig. 5 shows a very similar uniformity behaviour and al-
lows the determination of the corresponding photoelectron yield for a given
light yield. Here LY = 74% corresponds to PY = 7600 e0/ MeV. This rela-
tion was veriﬁed later with a larger number of crystals.

The uniformity of the crystal light output does not depend on the area
covered by the readout device, as shown in Fig. 6. All other photodiode
measurements described in the remainder of this article were performed fol-
lowing the prescription of section 2.2 without uniformity scan, whereas all
photomultiplier uniformity scans were measured with the monitoring setups
as described in section 2.1. The uniformity plots will always have the pho-
tomultiplier located at position 36 cm (the larger crystal area). The plotted
values are the relative variation of light yield at a given position from the
average yield in percent.

3 Optimization of Crystal Light Yield and

Uniformity

In this section the inﬂuence of type, quality, and thickness of wrapping mate-
rial on crystal light yield and uniformity is described. A method to improve
the uniformity of the light output is presented. These studies were performed
with the photomultiplier setup which gives more precise results. The inﬂu-
ence of optical properties of diﬀerent coupling materials between crystal and

photodiodes is described in section 3.3.

3.1 Crystal Wrapping

After measuring the light output achieved by only internal reﬂection of scin-
tillation light in a crystal with surfaces polished by the manufacturer, see
Fig. 7(a), consecutive layers of 38 µm thick Teﬂon PTFE are added. With
more material wrapped around the crystal, the light yield increases and uni-
formity improves. Using an ideal reﬂecting 5 µm thick aluminum foil after
three layers of Teﬂon results in the same total light yield as use of an ad-
ditional layer of Teﬂon (Fig. 7(d) and (e)) . The comparison of four layers
Teﬂon (∼ 160 µm in total) with one layer of 200 µm thick Teﬂon shows that
the multilayer conﬁguration gives a higher light yield, Fig. 7(d) and (f). The
gain in light yield and uniformity by adding additional layers of material is
compromised by the increasing amount of dead material between crystals.

Since Teﬂon PTFE shows an unfavourable longtime behaviour (multi-
layers tend to be pressed together, thus forming a monolayer with reduced
reﬂecting properties) and is diﬃcult to handle because of its adhesive proper-
ties, DuPont Tyvek was investigated as an alternative [9, 14]. This material

is a porous, chalk-loaded polyethylene ﬂeece, which is supplied in diﬀerent
qualities and thicknesses. For the Tyvek types 1025D, 1056D, and 1059D to-
tal light yield values were measured, which are comparable to the results for
multilayers of Teﬂon of similar total thickness. Fig. 8 shows uniformity plots
for one and two layers of Tyvek 1056 D, 160 µm per layer, with and without
an additional aluminum foil layer. With increasing material thickness, the
uniformity again improves. The aluminum foil not only gives higher light
yield values, but also provides electromagnetic shielding of the crystal.

3.2 Uniformity Tuning

A uniform crystal response is important for the linearity of a detector and the
energy resolution, since the position of the shower maximum varies with the
incident energy and ﬂuctuates for ﬁxed energies. An additional advantage

total light yield decreases using this method.

of Tyvek is the possibility to improve the uniformity of the light output
of crystals by changing local absorption properties at the crystal surface
without machining the crystal itself. This is done by blackening the Tyvek
at appropriate positions. An example is shown in Fig. 9.

3.3 Optical Coupling

Two general types of coupling of the photodiodes to the crystal rear surface
were investigated: wavelength shifter and direct readout [12, 13].

3.3.1 Wavelength Shifter Readout

The wavelength shifters consisted of ﬂuorescent dyes, dissolved in 3 mm thick
lucite (PMMA) carrier plates covering the whole crystal rear face. Both inves-
tigated types (BASF Lumogen F red 300 and Roehm 2466 P) show similar op-
tical properties (several absorption maxima at about 440 nm, 530 . . . 540 nm,
and 560 . . . 570 nm; ﬂuorescence emission at ∼ 625 nm), thus eﬀectively col-
lecting the crystal scintillation light and transforming it into a wavelength
range where the quantum eﬃciency of the photodiode is higher (see section
2.2). They had the full size of the crystal rear surface and were coupled
via a small (∼ 0.5 mm) airgap to the crystal. The diodes were glued onto
two adjacent narrow sides of the wavelength shifter. The rear area was cov-
ered by a diﬀuse reﬂecting material (Tyvek), whereas all the lateral faces
not equipped with photodiodes were painted with polyurethane based reﬂec-

tive paint NE 561. The adhesive used to glue the photodiodes S 3588-03
(mod 5400) to the wavelength shifter was Cargille Meltmount with an index
of refraction of 1.53, well matched to the corresponding values for PMMA
and the entrance window of the photodiodes (both ∼ 1.5).

Using two photodiodes on adjacent edges of the wavelength shifter did not
double the photoelectron yield compared to the readout with one photodi-
ode, but increased it by a factor of 1.5 only. The second photodiode does not
transfer all absorbed light into measureable charge, whereas a reﬂecting ma-
terial at position of the second photodiode redirects a part of the light to the
ﬁrst photodiode. This is compared in Table 1 with an absorber (30 mm black
Scotch tape) placed at the position of the second photodiode. In this case, the
light yield is only two thirds of the value achieved with one photodiode and
a reﬂector. The maximum photoelectron yield of 6050 e0/ MeV for two pho-
todiodes was achieved with an octagonal wavelenght shifter with 30 mm on
an edge (= length of photodiode window) and a diameter of 60 mm between
parallel sides. This corresponds to an equivalent noise energy of 105 keV for
the crystal.

3.3.2 Direct Readout

In case of the direct readout the main focus was the search for the best cou-
pling medium between the crystal and the photodiode entrance medium with
respect to photoelectron yield and reliability. In order to diminish long-time
eﬀects such as migration of ions from the crystal to the diodes active mate-
rial, which could result in a decrease of the photoelectron yield, additional
transparent coupling plates were investigated [13, 15]. Their optical proper-
ties are given in Table 2. Because of the diﬀerence in the indices of refraction
of the crystal (nCsI = 1.79) and the entrance window of the photodiode

(nP D = 1.50) materials with higher refractive index are favoured [16]. This
is also the reason for typically ∼ 15% lower photoelectron yield in the case of
a small airgap between crystal and photodiodes. Table 3 shows the various
optical adhesives which have been investigated, and typical ranges of pho-
toelectron yields for a class of adhesives. Comparing the results in Table 3,
optical grease and epoxies give the highest photoelectron yields. Because of
its poor longterm behaviour (it tends to ﬂow and to change color), optical
grease cannot be considered for CsI(Tl) crystal based calorimeters.

The highest photoelectron yields were achieved with the last three epox-
ies of Table 3. They all have a refractive index of 1.56. Using BC 600
for both glue joints (coupling plate to crystal and photodiodes to coupling
plate) the three coupling plate types Lucite, B-Si-Glass, and Polystyrene
give very similar photoelectron yields (∼ 8000 e0/ MeV), whereas Lexan is
worse (7000 e0/ MeV). Bor-Silicate Glass is very fragile and hard to ma-
chine and handle. EPOTEK 301-2 tended towards disconnecting from the
crystal over longer time periods (∼ months). Using the combination photo-
diodes - BC 600 - lucite plate and testing the three epoxies for the coupling
plate - crystal joint, EPILOX A17-01 is slightly favoured (8150 e0/ MeV vs.
7900 e0/ MeV). The best result was achieved when using a polystyrene cou-
pling plate and EPILOX for both glue joints (8450 e0/ MeV). This corre-
sponds to a equivalent noise energy of 100 keV, in the same range as in the
case of the wavelength shifter readout. The lower photoelectron yield of the
latter is compensated by the lower intrinsic noise of the smaller diodes, see
Eq. 3. For all measurements the rear area of the crystal surrounding the pho-
todiodes was covered by a diﬀuse reﬂecting plate (either Tyvek or reﬂective
paint NE 561). Without these rear reﬂectors the measured photoelectron

14

yields were about 30% lower.

4 Temperature Dependence of Crystal Light

Yield and Uniformity

Diﬀerent values for the temperature dependence of the CsI(Tl) light yield
are reported in the literature. In most studies [7, 17] the light yield depen-
dence was measured for small crystals in a wide temperature range (−100◦C
to +50◦C) in coarse steps. These authors report an almost constant crystal
light yield between 10◦C and 30◦C. Here, we concentrate on a comparison of
the crystal light yield for photodiode and photomultiplier readout near room
temperature, where large calorimeters are operated [18].

Photomultipliers have their own own temperature dependence, the used
type Hamamatsu R669 shows a temperature coeﬃcient of −0.3%/ K at 550 nm
[8]. However, its inﬂuence is corrected by the reference system described in
section 2.1. The crystal temperature was varied between 10◦C and 30◦C.
For these measurements, an airgap of 1 mm between photocathode and crys-
tal was chosen in order to allow for thermal expansion of the crystal. The
photomultiplier was operated at constant temperature, in this way further
reducing the measurement errors. The procedure was repeated three times;
after the last measurement crystal and photomultiplier were slowly heated
to 30◦C.

In order to get a stabilized coupling of the photodiodes to the crys-
tal, they were glued to the crystal using BICRON BC 600 epoxy and a
1 mm thick lucite plate and cooled down together with the crystal. Since
the temperature dependence of the photosensitivity of the diodes is only
0.01%/ K at 550 nm [11], this will not distort the measured crystal prop-
erties. Fig. 10 shows the dependence of crystal light yield, normalized to
25◦C. The crystal temperature coeﬃcients were determined by a straight
line ﬁt to the data. The results are +(0.40 ± 0.01)%/ K for photomultiplier
and +(0.28 ± 0.02)%/ K for photodiode readout, respectively. A reason for
the diﬀerence between photomultiplier and photodiode readout could be the
diﬀerent spectral sensitivity of both systems, which indicates a decreasing
temperature dependence of the scintillation light with longer wavelengths.
This would also explain the higher value of +0.6%/ K found in [5], where a

15

(a) and photodiode (b) readout. The temperature error bars indicate the
temperature change during one measurement.

blue-sensitive photomultiplier was used. For photodiode readout these au-
thors ﬁnd +0.3%/ K at 20◦C and report a ﬂat maximum at 30◦C to 40◦C.
A hint of the latter can be seen in Fig. 10(b). The uniformity of crystal
response did not change in the investigated temperature range.

5 Inﬂuence of Radiation Damage on Crystal

Light Yield and Uniformity

The inﬂuence of radiation damage on the crystal light yield varies strongly
with intrinsic crystal properties (e.g. Thallium concentration, impurities,
absorption length). Therefore, the measured crystal described below does
not represent general CsI(Tl) properties; it merely shows what kind of mea-
surements and precision can be achieved with the setups described in sec-
tion 2 [18].

The front face of a 36 cm long CsI(Tl) crystal was irradiated several times
with increasing dose, using a point like ∼ 200 GBq 60Co source, mounted at a
ﬁxed distance of 23 cm. The time between individual irradiations was chosen
to be one week, in order to allow for studies of relaxation processes.

16

The deposited energy dose in the crystal was determined by two indepen-
dent dose measurements. At a low dose of about 70 rad, four LiF dosimeters
with a thickness of 0.85 mm were put on the corners of the crystal front face.
The measured dose rate for LiF was (307 ± 16) rad/h. All following measure-
ments were scaled by the irradiation time according to this measurement. In
order to check the dose extrapolation at the highest individual dose of about
7 krad, four Alanine dosimeters with a thickness of 0.987 mm were put at the
same position and a dose rate of (282 ± 8) rad/h was measured. Owing to
the smaller error of the last measurement all other were scaled by the irra-
diation time according to this measurement. In order to get the energy dose
deposited at the crystal front face by photons of 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV,
the energy doses quoted in this section were evaluated for CsI using the ratio
of the mass energy absorption coeﬃcients for photons of 1.25 MeV for CsI
(µen/ρ = 2.402 · 10−2 cm2/g) and for Alanine (µen/ρ = 2.878 · 10−2 cm2/g)
[19]. During the measurements, radiation doses from about 10 rad up to
7 krad in steps of about a factor of two were deposited at the front face of
the crystal.

After each irradiation step, the intensity of phosphorescence light (af-
terglow) was measured as the anode current of the photomultiplier which
was DC-coupled to a voltage/current device. To protect the photocathode,
these measurements were started after the phosphorescence light level corre-
sponded to less than 40 µA anode current at a voltage of 1 kV. Fig. 11a shows
the current measurements after an irradiation of 12 rad. Fig. 11b shows the
dependence of the phoshorescence time constant τ on the deposited energy
dose, deﬁned by I(t) = I0 + I1 exp (−t/τ ). The relaxation times τ rise from
20 min to 90 min for doses increasing from 12 rad to 7 krad. The constant cur-
rents I0 in the ﬁt of the time dependence increase from ∼ 3 µA to ∼ 22 µA
over this dose range. Repeated measurements six days after each individual
irradiation show values between 100 nA and 400 nA, whereas the value before
any irradiation was about 80 nA. These measurements indicate additional
relaxation time constants for radiation induced phosphorescence on the order
of days.

The inﬂuence of the accumulated energy dose on the crystal light yield
was investigated with photomultiplier (137Cs source) and photodiode (88Y
source) readout. Directly after irradiation, a decrease of the crystal light

yield is observed which reaches a constant level a few hours (days) after ir-
radiation with low (higher) doses. Therefore, the light output on the fourth
day after irradiation was chosen as a measure for the reduction of light yield
after successive irradiations and plotted versus the accumulated energy dose
in CsI in Fig. 12. In the case of photodiode readout, the diodes were ﬁxed
with a minimal airgap at the crystal rear, in order to prevent radiation dam-
age to the diodes and to allow for alternating photomultiplier and photodiode
measurements of the same crystal. Therefore, the measured photoelectron
yield is smaller than with glued diodes. The errors are larger because of the
reproducibility of the optical coupling. At an accumulated energy dose of
∼ 14 krad, light reductions of (14.5 ± 1.0)% and (11 ± 3)% are measured with
the photomultiplier and photodiode readout setup, respectively. In repeated
measurements during the week between two irradiations and months after
the last irradiation no recovery of the light output was observed. On the
other hand, the uniformity curve of the crystal shows no change, even at the
highest dose.

The observed phosphorescence contributes to an additional background
near threshold as shown in Fig. 13. It also has an eﬀect on the width of the
662 keV photon peak from the 137Cs source, which is used as a measure of the

crystal light yield. If one quadratically subtracts the width of the 137Cs peak
without afterglow from the corresponding one with afterglow (measured a few
hours after irradiating with the highest applied dose) one gets a contribution
of the afterglow to the width of (30±5) keV. This corresponds to a change in
energy resolution σE/E from 6.6% to 8.0% measured with the photomultiplier
setup. The observed reduction of crystal light yield is similar to results of [20],
which observe typical decreases of 5%, 15%, and 30% at 10 rad, 100 rad, and
1 krad, respectively, without uniformity changes for crystals from the same
manufacturer. Older studies [6, 21] often found higher decreases, up to 25%
below ∼ 100 rad and 50% at ∼ 10 krad, probably due to higher levels of
impurities in crystals [22]. All these studies used coarser steps in the applied
doses.

6 Conclusions

A photomultiplier setup in conjunction with a temperature stabilized refer-
ence system was developed and put into operation. It allows precise mea-
surements of CsI(Tl) crystal light yield and uniformity with an accuracy of
0.3%. This setup was used for optimization of the crystal light yield and for
tuning the light output uniformity. An optimized coupling of Silicon PIN

photodiodes to crystals was established with respect to photoelectron yield
and electronic noise. For long CsI(Tl) crystals of 19.4 radiation lengths,
photoelectron yields of ∼ 6000 e0/ MeV for wavelength shifter readout and
∼ 8500 e0/ MeV for direct readout and corresponding equivalent noise ener-
gies of ∼ 100 keV (RMS) were achieved. The temperature dependence of the
relative crystal light yield and the photoelectron yield were determined to be
+(0.40 ± 0.01)%/ K and +(0.28 ± 0.02)%/ K for photomultiplier and photo-
diode readout, respectively. After irradiation of one crystal with an intense
60Co γ source in steps up to ∼ 14 krad accumulated energy dose, a reduction
in crystal light yield in the range of 10% to 15% and afterglow eﬀects caused
by phosphorescence, were observed.

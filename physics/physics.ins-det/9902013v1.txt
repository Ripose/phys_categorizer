Abstract. Compton backscattering polarimetry provides a fast measurement of the
polarization of an electron beam in a storage ring. Since the method is non-destructive,
the polarization of the electrons can be monitored during internal target experiments.
At NIKHEF a Compton polarimeter has been constructed to measure the polarization
of the longitudinally polarized electrons stored in the AmPS ring. First results obtained
with the polarimeter, the ﬁrst Compton polarimeter to measure the polarization of a
stored longitudinally polarized electron beam, are presented in this paper.

INTRODUCTION

The NIKHEF Compton polarimeter has been constructed to measure the longi-
tudinal polarization of electrons stored in the AmPS ring. The polarized electrons
are provided by a recently commissioned polarized electron source (PES) [1]. While
Compton backscattering polarimeters are used to measure the polarization of trans-
versely polarized stored electron beams [2,3], NIKHEF’s detector was the ﬁrst to

measure the polarization of a longitudinally polarized stored beam [4].

In this technique, a circularly polarized photon beam (polarization S3, energy Eλ)
is backscattered from a stored polarized electron beam (polarization Pe, energy Ee).
The cross section for Compton scattering of circularly polarized photons from

longitudinally polarized electrons can be written as

dσ
dEγ

=

dσ0
dEγ

[1 + S3Pzα3z(Eγ)],

(1)

where dσ0
follows from the energy spectrum for unpolarized electrons and photons
dEγ
and Pz represents the longitudinal component of the electron polarization. For a
given Eλ and Ee the asymmetry can be written as,

A(Eγ) =

NL(Eγ) − NR(Eγ)
NL(Eγ) + NR(Eγ)

= ∆S3Pzα3z(Eγ)

(2)

where NL(Eγ) (NR(Eγ)) is the number of photons with energy Eγ with incident
left (right) handed helicity, and ∆S3 is the diﬀerence between the two polarization
states, divided by two. Pe is determined by taking Pz as a free parameter and
ﬁtting the measured asymmetry with eq. 2. The relation between Pz and Pe is
determined by the lattice of the storage ring.

LAYOUT OF THE POLARIMETER

A schematic layout of the Compton polarimeter is shown in ﬁg. 1. The polarime-
ter consists of a laser system with its associated optical system and a detector for
the detection of backscattered photons.

Laser photons are produced by a 10 W CW Ar-ion laser, operated at 514 nm.
Part of the mirrors in the optical path can be controlled remotely, in order to
optimize the overlap of the electron and laser beam. A quarter-wave plate is used
to convert the initially linearly polarized photons to circularly polarized. A Pockels
cell is used to switch the helicity between left and right, while a half-wave plate
can be inserted in the optical path to check for false asymmetries by reversing the
sign of the Compton asymmetry.

Laser photons interact with stored electrons in the straight section (length ≈ 3 m)
between the ﬁrst dipole and second dipole (bending angles 11.25◦) after the internal
target facility. The backscattered photons leave the interaction region traveling in
the same direction as the electrons of the beam and are separated from them after
the second dipole. They are detected in a gamma detector, consisting of a block of
100 × 100 × 240 mm3 pure CsI.

A chopper mounted immediately after the Ar-ion laser is used to block the laser
light for 1/3 of the time for background measurements. The chopper is operated
at 75 Hz and also generates the driving signal for the Pockels cell.

RESULTS

The storage ring could only be operated with a 10% partial snake [5]. Therefore,
it was necessary to perform all measurements with an electron beam energy of
440 MeV, resulting in a maximum energy for the Compton photons of 7.04 MeV.
This energy is lower than that of the design speciﬁcation (500–900 MeV), resulting
in a poor energy resolution. To reduce background at this rather low energy, we
performed all measurements with beam currents smaller than 15 mA. The rate
of backscattered photons was in the order of 8 kHz/mA at full laser power, in
agreement with simulations.

To minimize the eﬀects of false asymmetries (induced by a small steering ef-
fect of the Pockels Cell), we performed sets of six independent measurements to
determine the electron polarization. Three measurements were done with diﬀer-
ent electron polarizations injected into the ring (positive helicity, unpolarized and
negative helicity). These measurements were repeated with the half-wave plate of
the polarimeter inserted in the optical path. The measurements with unpolarized
electrons were used to determine and correct for false asymmetries, while the in-
sertion of the half-wave plate was done as a consistency check. Figure 2 shows the
asymmetry before and after correction for false asymmetries.

To determine the stability of the polarimeter, one measurement was repeated nine
times. To exclude any sensitivity to variations in the polarization of the injected
electrons or spin life time, those measurements were performed with unpolarized
electrons. The total measurement time was ≈ 90 min, while a full set of six mea-

surements normally takes about 60 min. The results are shown in ﬁg. 3 and show
good stability on this time scale.

The long-term stability is determined from polarization measurements done typ-
ically once a day. These measurements are sensitive not only to variations of the
polarimeter, but also to any other time-dependent eﬀect such as a degradation of
the cathode used at PES. The results (see ﬁg. 3) show no trend in the polarization
of the electrons, indicating a good long-term stability for all components.

The polarimeter has been used successfully to optimize the settings of the Z-
manipulator at PES. After the optimization, the spin life time (τ ) and initial
polarization (P0) has been determined by combining the data of nine measure-
ments of six minutes each. The combined data have been rebinned as a function of
time and the polarization has been determined for each bin separately. We found
P0 = 61.6 ± 1.4% (statistical), and τ = 4500+5900
−1600 s. The spin life time is in agree-
ment with our calculations. The polarization measured with the Mott polarimeter
at PES was 82±5%. The diﬀerence between the polarization measured by the Mott
polarimeter and by the Compton polarimeter may be caused by depolarization due
to the focusing solenoids in the linac or depolarizing resonances during damping of
the beam.

CONCLUSIONS

Here, we describe the results of extensive tests done with a Compton backscat-
tering electron polarimeter. The tests have been performed at an electron energy
of 440 MeV and a partial snake. The results show that it is possible to operate

of stored electrons on the settings of the Z-manipulator, and to determine the spin

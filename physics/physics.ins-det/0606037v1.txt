Abstract

The Tokai–to–Kamioka (T2K) experiment is a second generation long baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment which aims at a sensitive search for the νe appear-
ance. The main design features of the T2K near neutrino detectors located at 280
m from the target are presented. Scintillator counters developed for the T2K near
detectors are described. Readout of the counters is provided via WLS ﬁbers embed-
ded into S–shape grooves in a scintillator and viewed from both ends by multi–pixel
avalanche photodiodes operating in a limited Geiger mode. A description, oper-
ational principles and the results of tests of photosensors with a sensitive area of
1.1 mm2 are presented. A time resolution of 1.5 ns, a spatial resolution of 9.9–12.4
cm, and a MIP detection eﬃciency of more than 99% were obtained for scintillator
detectors in a beam test.

1 Introduction

The T2K project [1] is a second generation long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment
which will use a high intensity oﬀ–axis neutrino beam produced by the JPARC 50 GeV
(initially 40 GeV) proton beam. The ﬁrst phase of the T2K experiment pursues two
main goals: a sensitive measurement of θ13 and a more accurate determination of the
parameters sin22θ23 and ∆m2
23 than any previous experiment.
To achieve the physics goals, it is important to provide precise measurements of the
neutrino beam properties, neutrino ﬂux, spectrum and interaction cross sections. For
these purposes, the near detector complex (ND280 [2]) will be built at the distance of 280
m from the target along the line between the average pion decay point and the Super-
Kamiokande detector. In order to keep the systematics uncertainties below the statistical
error, the physics requirements for ND280, discussed in detail in Ref. [2], can be brieﬂy
summarized as follows. The energy scale of the neutrino spectrum must be understood
at the 2% level, and the neutrino ﬂux should be monitored with better than 5% accuracy.
The momentum resolution of muons from the charged current quasi–elastic interactions
should be less than 10%, and the threshold for the detection of the recoil protons is
required to be about 200 MeV/c. The νe fraction is to be measured with an uncertainty
of better than 10%. The measurement of the neutrino beam direction with precision much
better than 1 mrad is expected to be provided by the on–axis detector (neutrino monitor).
The oﬀ–axis ND280 is shown in Fig. 1 and consists of the UA1 magnet operated with

a magnetic ﬁeld of 0.2 T, a Pi-Zero detector (POD), a tracking detector which includes
time projection chambers (TPC’s) and ﬁne grained scintillator detectors (FGD’s), an
electromagnetic calorimeter (Ecal), and a side muon range detector (SMRD).

The POD has been designed to be similar to the MINERνA detector [3]. It is installed
in the upstream end of the magnet and optimized for measurement of the inclusive π0 pro-
duction by νµ on oxygen. The POD consists of 76 tracking planes composed of triangular
polystyrene scintillating bars (about 2 × 104) alternating with thin (0.6 mm) lead foils.
Each bar has a 3 cm base, 1.5 cm height and a central hole for a WLS ﬁber. Three TPC’s
will measure the 3–momenta of muons produced by charged current interactions in the de-
tector and will provide the most accurate measurements of the neutrino energy spectrum.
The ND280 will contain two FGD’s, each with dimensions 2 × 2 × 0.3 m3 resulting in a
total target mass of 1.2 tons. The ﬁrst FGD will be an active scintillator detector, similar
to the SciBar [4] detector of the K2K experiment [5]. Each FGD layer will consist of 200
scintillator bars, and thirty layers will be arranged in alternating vertical and horizontal
layers perpendicular to the beam direction. The second FGD will consists of x − y layers
scintillator bars alternating with 3 cm thick layers of passive water. The Ecal surrounds
the POD and tracking region and consists of 15 layers, each of which has one sheet of 3
mm Pb alloy and one layer of 1 cm thick × 5 cm wide plastic scintillator bars (with signal
readout by WLS ﬁbers). Interior to this section is the preradiator section, where each of
the 3 layers consists of a lead alloy sheet backed by 3 layers of scintillator bars. Air gaps
in the UA1 magnet will be instrumented with plastic scintillator to measure the ranges
of muons which escape at large angles with respect to the neutrino beam and which can
not be measured by the TPC’s. The active component of the SMRD will use scintillators
with wavelength shifting ﬁbers (WLS) readout to transport the light into photosensors.
The ND280 detector will widely use WLS ﬁber readout with light detection from ﬁbers
by photosensors which have to operate in a magnetic ﬁeld environment and limited space
inside the UA1 magnet. The primary candidate for the photosensor is the multi–pixel
avalanche photo-diode operating in the limited Geiger multiplication mode [6,8–10]. Such
photodiodes are compact, well matched to spectral emission of WLS ﬁbers, and insensitive
to magnetic ﬁelds [11, 12].

2 Geiger mode multi–pixel avalanche photodiodes

2.1 Overview

The multi-pixel avalanche photodiodes with a metal–resistor–semiconductor layer struc-
ture operating in the limited Geiger mode (hereafter referred to as MRS APD’s or MRS
photodiodes) are invented and designed by the Center of Perspective Technologies and
Apparatus (CPTA), Moscow [6]. Detailed description of these devices and principles of
operation can be found in Refs. [7, 9, 13]. Such a photosensor consists of many pixels on
a common p–type silicon substrate. A simpliﬁed topology of a MRS photodiode is shown
in Fig. 2. Each pixel operates as an independent Geiger micro-counter with a gain of the
same order as a vacuum photomultiplier. Geiger discharge is initiated by a photoelectron

in the high electric ﬁeld created in a very thin layer of about 1 µm by the applied bias
voltage. The discharge current for each pixel produces a voltage drop at individual resis-
tors. As a result, the electric ﬁeld density becomes small and can no longer support the
discharge quenched in such a way. Small pixels are separated by grooves ﬁlled with an
optically non–transparent material to suppress the cross–talks. The gain is determined by
the charge accumulated in a pixel capacitance: Qpixel = Cpixel·∆V , where ∆V is diﬀerence
between the bias voltage and the breakdown voltage of the diode (overvoltage). Since ∆V
is about a few volts and Cpixel ≃ 50 fF, then typical Qpixel ≃ 150 fC, that corresponds to
106 electrons. A single incident photon can ﬁre more than one pixel. Thus, the gain of
the MRS photodiode is equal to the charge of a pixel multiplied by the average number
of pixels ﬁred by a single photon.

The amplitude of a single pixel signal does not depend on the triggered number of
carriers in this pixel. In such a way, the photodiode signal is a sum of ﬁred pixels. Each
pixel operates as a binary device, but the multi–pixel photodiode as a whole unit is an
analogue detector with a dynamic range limited by the ﬁnite number of pixels. The pixel
size can be 15 × 15 to 70 × 70 µm2, and the total number of pixels is 100–4000 per mm2.
We tested the CPTA MRS photodiodes with a sensitive area of 1.1 mm2 with 556 pixels
of 45 × 45 µm2 size (see Fig. 3).

side–to–side distance.

2.2 Basic properties of the CPTA MRS photodiodes

The main parameters of the MRS photodiodes such as the gain, photon detection eﬃ-
ciency, intrinsic noise, cross–talk, depend on the applied bias voltage. The MRS pho-
todiodes were tested using a signal from a green light emitting diode (LED). The MRS
signal was ampliﬁed and split into two signals: one was fed to a discriminator, another
was measured by an ADC with a gate of about 100 ns.

Gain. A typical operating voltage is around 40 V for the tested MRS photodiodes,
although the voltage can diﬀer by a few volts to provide the same gain in photodiodes.
The MRS photodiode has an excellent single photoelectron (p.e.) resolution determined
mainly by electronics noise even at room temperature. It means that there is only a small
pixel to pixel gain variation as well as small ﬂuctuations in Geiger discharge development.
The absolute gain depends on the photodiode topology, bias voltage and temperature.
The voltage and temperature sensitivities of the MRS photodiode gain are rather weak
as will be demonstrated below. A 0.1 V change in bias voltage corresponds to a 2–3%
variation in gain. The charge of a single p.e. signal in a calibrated ADC was used to
determine the MRS photodiode gain. The typical gain value at room temperature (22◦C)
is obtained to be about 0.5 × 106.

Photon detection eﬃciency. The photon detection eﬃciency (PDE) of a multi-pixel

avalanche photodiode operating in the limited Geiger mode is a product of 3 factors:

PDE = QE · εGeiger · εpixel,

(1)

where QE is the wavelength dependent quantum eﬃciency, εGeiger is the probability for a
photoelectron to initiate the Geiger discharge, εpixel is a fraction of the total photodiode
area occupied by sensitive pixels. The bias voltage aﬀects one parameter in expression (1)
εGeiger. The geometrical factor εpixel is completely determined by the MRS photodiode

5

topology. Its value is estimated to be about 70–80% in an ideal case. The absolute value of
the PDE was measured using small pulses from a green LED (525 nm) which illuminated a
MRS photodiode through a 0.5 mm diameter collimator. The number of emitted photons
was obtained using a calibrated PMT XP2020. The normalized PDE values at 525 nm for
diﬀerent bias voltages are presented in Fig. 4. The cross-talk contribution was subtracted

from the signal to obtain the correct value of the PDE, the accuracy of which is estimated
to be about 20%. As seen in Fig. 4, the PDE is about 12% at a dark rate of 1 MHz. The
PDE can be increased up to almost 30% at the expense of much higher dark rate.

The PDE dependence on the wavelength of the detected light, as well as the emission
spectrum of the WLS ﬁber Y11 are shown in Fig. 5. The peak emission of the ﬁber
depends on its length due to the absorption of the light. The spectral response of a MRS
photodiode was measured in a spectrophotometer calibrated with a PIN–diode [15]. The
PDE was measured at higher Vbias and, therefore, the dark rate was higher (about 2.3
MHz for a discriminator threshold of 0.5 p.e.). The PDE decreases by about 50% when
Vbias is lowered such that the dark rate is ∼ 1 MHz.

readout of scintillators is the dark noise rate which originates from thermally created
carriers in the depletion region under high electric ﬁelds. The dark rate mainly consists of
single p.e. pulses. Larger amplitude pulses also contribute to the dark rate, as shown in
Fig. 6. However, the intensity of the pulses with 2 p.e. amplitudes is about 15 times less
than the intensity of the single p.e. pulses. Large amplitudes (> 1 p.e.) are generated
by the optical cross-talk as well as by accidental pile-ups between the independent pixels,
though the second eﬀect is relatively small. The dark rate decreases to the level of a
few kHz for the threshold of 2.5 p.e. The intensity of 1 p.e. pulses as well as 2 p.e.
pulses is signiﬁcantly higher for higher bias voltage, as can be seen from Fig. 6 in case
of Vbias = 39.8 V. Dark pulses and mostly leakages create the dark current through a
MRS photodiode in a typical range of 0.3 − 1.0 µA. The dark rate decreases to about
1 kHz/mm2 at −70◦C, i.e. decreases by a factor of 2 for every temperature drop of 9−10◦C
for a threshold of 0.5 p.e. and and the condition of keeping the gain at a constant value
by tuning the bias voltage.

Optical cross–talk. A single incident photon can create more than a single p.e. due to
optical cross–talk. The mechanism of this eﬀect is not quite clear. Models predict that
during the Geiger discharge and recombination of carriers infrared photons are emitted.
These photons penetrate into the adjacent pixels and ﬁre them. Optical cross–talk leads
to a higher than expected signal as Geiger discharge occur in additional pixels. The
absolute value of the cross–talk can be calculated by assuming a Poisson distribution for
the number of photoelectrons observed in response to the light from a LED. When the
MRS photodiode noise is small, the measured mean number of ﬁred pixels by the LED

photons, ¯NLED, is compared with the calculated value ¯Npe given by

¯Npe = −lnP (0),

(2)

where P (0) is the fraction of 0 p.e., or “pedestal” events. Then the deviation of the
ratio ¯NLED/ ¯Npe from 1 gives the cross–talk value. These values are presented for several
bias voltages in Fig. 4. A cross–talk value of about 5% was obtained at a bias voltage
that provides a dark noise rate of ≤ 1 MHz at a discriminator threshold of 0.5 p.e. The
cross–talk is larger for higher bias voltage. The sharp decrease of the dark rate shown in
Fig. 6 is a good demonstration of the low optical cross–talk. It should be noted that the
signal amplitude in photoelectrons is less than the measured amplitude determined as the
average number of ﬁred pixels by the cross-talk value, i.e. by a few per cent.

Temperature dependence. The PDE and gain of MRS photodiodes (as well as the
signal amplitude) are expected to be sensitive to temperature because the breakdown
voltage depends on temperature. The MRS signal amplitude (light yield) is proportional

8

to Nphotons × PDE × gain, where Nphotons is the number of photons from the LED which
illuminate the photodiode. The parameters of the MRS photodiodes were measured over
temperatures from 15◦ to 33◦C. The temperature variation of the MRS signal (a green
LED was used as a light source) is presented in Fig. 7. The MRS signal dependency

of -1.5 %/◦C is obtained for increasing temperature. The MRS gain itself decreases
with temperature as -1.2 %/◦C (see Fig. 7), while the PDE varies with temperature as
-0.3 %/◦C. The dark rate depends on temperature with a coeﬃcient of 62 kHz/◦C, as
shown in Fig. 8. Decreasing the temperature below 0◦C greatly reduces the noise and
increases the PDE, as shown in Ref. [15].

Recovery time. The ability of MRS photodiodes to operate at high counting rates was
tested using two LED signals. We measured the amplitude of the second signal A2(t) as
a function of the time diﬀerence t between the ﬁrst and second signal. Fig. 9 shows the
ratio A2(t)/A2(0), where A2(0) is the amplitude of the second signal when the ﬁrst LED
signal is oﬀ. As seen from Figure 9, a minimum time interval between the ﬁrst and second
pulse of about 5 µs is needed to recover about 95% of the full amplitude of the second
signal. This long recovery time is due to the fact that the individual resistor of each pixel,
Rpixel, has the value of about 20 MΩ, the pixel capacitance Cpixel is typically 50 fF that
gives τ = Rpixel · Cpixel ∼ 1µs.

Dynamic range and linearity. The dynamic range of the MRS photodiode is limited
by the ﬁnite number of pixels. The saturation of the MRS photodiode in response to
large light signals is shown in Fig. 10. In this test, the LED signal was ajusted to obtain
similar response for both PMT and MRS photodiode at the light yield below 150 p.e. The

photodiode signal is linear for low amplitutes. A nonlinearity of about 10% is already
seen for a signal of 150–200 p.e. For the PMT signal of 500 p.e., the MRS photodiode
has a 30% smaller signal than that of the PMT. Full saturation of the 556 pixel MRS
photodiode starts at a reference (PMT) signal of more than 2000 p.e.

Timing. The development of the Geiger discharge in a small depth (∼ 0.8 µm) of the
depletion region takes a few hundred picoseconds. The typical rise time is 1 ns, the decay
time is determined by the pixel capacitance. A laser with a wavelength of 635 nm and a
pulse width of 35 ps (fwhm) was used to measure the intrinsic time resolution of 1 p.e.
pulses. Very weak laser light created only 1 p.e. signals in a MRS photodiode. The time
resolution obtained for a threshold of 0.2 p.e. at 22◦C is presented in Fig. 11.

Life time. The failure rate of the MRS photodiodes is an important ﬁgure of merit for
the overall detector performance, because most photodiodes can not be replaced without
signiﬁcant disassembly of the ND280 detector. Exposures to elevated temperature are
used to evaluate the expected life time of semiconductor devices. We have placed 19
MRS photodiodes in an oven at 80◦C for 30 days. All photodiodes were kept under bias
voltages to provide the same dark current as at room temperature. One of the devices
started to conduct a large current after a week of heating. The failed device had the

All other devices passed the test without residual eﬀects, and the LED signals measured
by these MRS diodes after a period of 30 days of elevated temperatures did not show
any signiﬁcant degradation. The signals of the tested photodiodes in response to a LED
photons were measured before the heating and for a period of about 260 days after the
heating. The results for two devices are presented in Fig. 12. The accuracy of the l.y.
measurements is about 2.0 p.e. (rms) due to misalignments between the ﬁber and the
MRS photodiodes that are estimated to be between 20 and 100 µm in this series of tests.
For more than 7 months after heating no degradation in the light yield was observed.

Two hundred MRS photodiodes fabricated from a few diﬀerent wafers were tested. In
order to meet the requirements of the experiment, the dark rate of each device should be
kept close to a reference value of 1 MHz at room temperature 22◦C and for a discriminator
threshold of 0.5 p.e. This required the individual adjustment of the bias voltage of 38
to 42.1 V for each photodiode, that in turn resulted in a wide range of 8.9–18.8% for
the PDE values, and the gains of these 200 MRS photodiodes were found to be between
0.34 × 106 and 0.69 × 106.

3 Scintillator detectors with WLS ﬁber readout

Several subdetectors of the T2K near detector complex will be composed of many scin-
tillator detectors: rectangular and triangular scintillator bars, and various scintillating
slabs. All these elements use embedded WLS ﬁbers to read light from the scintillators.
A well known design will be adopted for the bars with WLS ﬁbers: one straight hole or
groove on one surface for a WLS ﬁber. For large scintillator slabs (SMRD, active elements
of Ecal), the usage of the standard readout scheme with several equidistant WLS ﬁbers
which run along the slab is not appropriate due to mechanical constraints of the UA1
magnet. We consider extruded scintillator slabs with a double–ended WLS ﬁber readout
technique as active elements for the SMRD detector. Instead of a few parallel WLS ﬁbers
we propose to use a single long WLS ﬁber embedded in an S–shape groove which reduces
the maximum path length that light has to travel within the scintillator to a few cm.
The detector prototypes were manufactured using an extrusion technique developed at
the Uniplast Factory, Vladimir, Russia. The scintillator is etched by a chemical agent
that results in the formation of a micropore deposit over the plastic surface. The thick-

ness of the deposit (30–100 µm) depends on the etching time. Details can be found in
Ref. [16]. A scintillator slab of 1x17x87 cm3 with an S–shaped groove of 3 mm depth was
manufactured for a test in a pion/proton beam. The half–period of the S–shape groove
is 58 mm, as shown in Fig. 13. A 2.55 m long multi–clad Kuraray Y11 (200 ppm dopant)
WLS ﬁber of 1 mm diameter is embedded into the groove with an optical grease and both
ends are attached to MRS photodiodes. To avoid the degradation of the Y11 parameters
in real SMRD counters, the bending procedure to make 3 cm radius loops will be done at
the temperature of about 80◦C.

This module was ﬁrst tested with cosmic muons. A light yield (l.y.) of 16.4 p.e. was
obtained for MIP’s in the center for summed signals from both photodiodes. In order to
suppress the timing spread caused by the trigger counters the combination (T DClef t −
T DCright)/2 was used to measure the time resolution. A time resolution of σ = 1.57 ns
was obtained for MIP’s which passed through the central part of the slab.

4 Beam tests of the SMRD prototype

4.1 Beam test setup

A beam test of extruded scintillators with embedded WLS ﬁbers was performed at the
KEK 12-GeV proton synchrotron with 1.4 GeV/c protons and pions. Two counters were
placed in a beam and tested simultaneously. One was the S–grooved scintillator (S–
counter) described in the previous section, another one was a scintillator slab, 1x18x50 cm3
in size, with a single straight groove in the middle of the plastic (W–counter). An 1.11 m
long Kuraray Y11(200) ﬁber of 1 mm diameter was embedded with optical grease into

the straight groove of the W–counter. The ﬁber in each counter is viewed from both
ends by MRS photodiodes. The ﬁbers are directly coupled to photosensors inside special
sockets. The detectors were mounted on a platform which could be moved horizontally
and vertically with respect to the beam line. Upstream of the counters, a TOF system
was used to separate pions and protons. Finger trigger counters restricted the beam spot
size to a 10 × 10mm2 square. The signals were ampliﬁed by fast hybrid preamps mounted
directly behind the photodiodes. The bias voltage was set individually for each MRS
photodiode to limit the dark rate to about 1.2 MHz for a 0.5 p.e. threshold. A simpliﬁed
electronic diagram of the beam test setup is shown in Fig. 14.

Only pions were selected for analysis as their response is close to that expected from
MIP’s in the T2K experiment. The ambient temperature drifted between 15–18◦C during
the beam test. Typical ADC spectra from pions are shown in Fig. 15. In this Figure, one
spectrum is obtained with a bias voltage of 38.7 V which corresponds to a dark rate of
0.86 MHz for a discriminator threshold of 0.5 p.e. The second spectrum is measured with
a bias voltage of 40.9 V corresponding to a dark rate of almost 2 MHz. The individual
photoelectron peaks are clearly separated at 38.7 V and still visible at 40.9 V.

4.2 Detection eﬃciency of MIP’s

The light yield scan over the S–counter surface is presented in Table 1. The beam spot
spreads beyond the scintillator area near the edges at y = ±80 mm causing the small
l.y. values. If the edges are ignored, the light output over the S–counter (sum of both

view (right).

is measured at the ends,
end signals) varies from 12 to 20 p.e./MIP. The largest l.y.
close to either of the two MRS photodiodes. In order to obtain the detection eﬃciency
the ADC spectra were analyzed. The event is considered accepted if its ADC amplitude
exceeds a certain threshold set in number of p.e. The average statistics in each location
is about 2000 events. Table 2 demonstrates the S–counter pion detection eﬃciency when
the threshold for the sum of both end signals is set to 2.5 p.e. The detection eﬃciency
is close to 100 % except for the edge area where a part of the beam missed the counter
due to some misalignment between the beam counters and the tested detector. For a
higher threshold of 4.5 p.e set for the sum of the amplitudes from the two ends, the
MIP detection eﬃciency is greater than 98%. We can conclude that the l.y. of more
than 12 p.e. (sum of both ends) satisﬁes the requirement for the S–counter to provide a
detection eﬃciency greater than 99% for a MIP. If we require that each MRS photodiode
signal exceeds 0.5 p.e. the MIP detection eﬃciency is found to be about 99.5%.

To make a detailed scan along the middle line of the S–counter the size of the beam
spot was reduced to 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The result is shown in Fig. 16. The WLS ﬁber route

is clearly reﬂected in the pattern of the l.y. distribution along the x–axis. A maximum
l.y. is observed in points where the beam crosses the ﬁber, while the l.y. drops by about
20% in between the ﬁber segments. Fig. 17 shows the result of the transverse l.y. scan
across the W–counter, which has a single straight groove running down the middle of the
counter. The attenuation length of scintillation light before capture by the WLS ﬁber is
obtained to be 9.0 ± 1.3 cm and 7.2 ± 1.2 cm for the upper and the lower part of the
W–counter, respectively. These values are consistent within measurement uncertainty,
and the average attenuation length of such a counter is estimated to be about 8.1 ± 0.9
cm.

4.3 Time and spatial resolution of the S–counter

The time resolution was measured with the discriminator thresholds set to a level of
0.5 p.e. for each MRS photodiode. To suppress the timing spread caused by the trigger
counters (as in the cosmic ray test) we used the combination (Tlef t −Tright)/2 to determine
the time resolution. The dependence of the time resolution on the light yield is presented
in Fig. 18. The time resolution depends on photostatistics and is proportional to 1/pNpe.
At a typical l.y. of 15 p.e./MIP σt = 1.75 ns is obtained. The time resolution of the S–
counter is mainly determined by the slow decay time of the Y11 ﬁber. Green light travels
along a WLS ﬁber at a speed of 17 cm/ns while the signal propagates along the counter
at a smaller speed of 7.4 cm/ns because of the ﬁber routing. The time spectra for 3
positions of the beam along the S–counter are shown in Fig. 19. The obtained time
diﬀerence between left and right signals allows us to extract the beam coordinate along

A spatial resolution of σx = 13.4 cm is obtained in the center of the S–counter and
σx(T ) = 10.4 cm near both ends.

The spatial resolution can be improved taking into account the light attenuation along
the ﬁber. The asymmetry between the signals from the left and right MRS photodiodes
(Alef t − Aright)/(Alef t + Aright) is sensitive to the hit position of a MIP, but the spatial
resolution obtained using the l.y. attenuation is poor (σx(A) ∼ 35 cm) because of large
ﬂuctuations in the light yields. However, the combination of both methods

x(T ) + wx(A)

where x(T ) and x(A) are the MIP positions obtained from timing and amplitude asym-
metry with accuracies of σx(T ) and σx(A), respectively. The weight w is given by w =
σ2
x(T )/σ2
x(A), allows us to slightly improve the spatial resolution. Fig. 20 shows the spatial
resolution for three beam positions obtained for the combination of the signal timing and
amplitude. The spatial resolution in the center of the S–counter is obtained to be 12.4
cm, while it is about 9.9 cm at both ends.

ﬁber which is embedded into an S–shape groove and viewed from both ends by multi–
pixel avalanche photodiodes operating in the limited Geiger mode. The studied MRS
photodiodes demonstrate good performance: a low cross-talk of a few per cent, the photon
detection eﬃciency for green light of about 12%, and a long term stability. These devices
are insensitive to magnetic ﬁelds, their calibration and stability control can be provided
by means of the excellent p.e. peak resolution. The linearity range of the tested MRS
photodiodes is less than 200 p.e. and the recovery time is about 5 µs. Although these
parameters might be critical for some applications, this performance is acceptable for
many detectors of the ND280 complex of the T2K experiment.

An average l.y. of about 15 p.e./MIP, a MIP detection eﬃciency greater than 99.5%,
a time resolution of 1.75 ns for a MIP, and a spatial resolution of σx = 9.9 − −12.4 cm
were obtained in a pion beam test.

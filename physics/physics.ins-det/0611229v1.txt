Abstract

We have operated a Medipix2 CMOS readout chip, with amplifying, shaping and
charge discriminating front-end electronics integrated on the pixel-level, as a highly
segmented direct charge collecting anode in a three-stage gas electron multiplier
(Triple-GEM) to detect the ionization from 55Fe X-rays and electrons from 106Ru.
The device allows to perform moderate energy spectroscopy measurements (20 %
FWHM at 5.9 keV X-rays) using only digital readout and two discriminator thresh-
olds. Being a truly 2D-detector, it allows to observe individual clusters of minimum
ionizing charged particles in Ar/CO2 (70:30) and He/CO2 (70:30) mixtures and to
achieve excellent spatial resolution for position reconstruction of primary clusters
50 µm, based on the binary centroid determination method.

1 Introduction

The development of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD), which has been
initiated and still driven by elementary particle and nuclear physics, oﬀers a
great potential as a high resolution tracking detector for a variety of appli-
cations. Recent advances in photolitography and microprocessing techniques
from chip industry triggered the development of more powerful detector con-
cepts, such as Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [1] and the MICRO MEsh

GAseous Structure (Micromegas) [2]. The COMPASS ﬁxed-target experiment
at CERN has pioneered the use of large area multi-GEM and Micromegas de-
tectors for particle tracking at high intensities, reaching 5 kHz/mm2 close
to the beam. Both technologies have achieved tracking eﬃciency close to
100 %, spatial resolution of the order of 70 - 100 µm and time resolution of
10 ns [3], [4]. The excellent performance and radiation hardness of GEM and
∼
Micromegas detectors after several years of successful running in COMPASS
has demonstrated the large-scale feasibility and robustness of the MPGD con-
cept. GEM detectors have also entered the LHC project; they will be used in
the LHCb Muon detector [5] and in the TOTEM telescopes [6].

Recently, Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors were readout by high granularity CMOS
pixel chips with integrated ampliﬁcation and digitization circuits (PixelA-
SICs). This techniques opens novel detection possibilities for the application
of MPGDs in the future generation of particle and astrophysics experiments. A
GEM detector coupled to a CMOS analog chip, comprising pixellated charge
collecting electrodes and readout electronics, can reconstruct the tracks of 55Fe
photoelectrons with a length as short as few hundred microns [7]- [10]. Another
possible active pixel anode plane for X-Ray Polarimetry is an amorphous sili-
con thin-ﬁlm transistor (TFT) array, like those used in ﬂat-panel monitors [11].
The use of pixellated gas detectors to enable true imaging of charged particle
tracks has been also proposed for an advanced Compton Telescope [12]-[14]
and for the search of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles [15].

The application of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors for high precision tracking
at the future International Linear Collider (ILC) is an active ﬁeld of R&D
in detector technology. A Time Projection Chamber (TPC) using MPGDs
as a gas ampliﬁcation device is one of the main options for charged particle
tracking [16], [17]. R&D is carried out within the ILC TPC collaboration aim-
ing at the construction of a large prototype in the coming years. While the
standard approach to readout the signals is a segmented pad plane with front-
end electronics attached through connectors from the backside, an attractive
possibility is the use of PixelASICs to serve as integrated device hosting the
pad, the preampliﬁcation and the digitization and sparsiﬁcation of the sig-
nals. This approach could oﬀer an ultimate TPC resolution and a possibility
to observe individual electrons formed in the gas and count the number of ion-
ization clusters per unit track length for particle discrimination [18]. Earlier
studies using GEM and Micromegas mounted on the Medipix2 chip provided
two-dimensional images of minimum ionizing track clusters [19] -[21].

In the following, we present results obtained with a Triple-GEM detector read-
out with Medipix2 ASIC, and irradiated with 55Fe X-rays and 106Ru electrons.
An overview of the Triple-GEM / Medipix2 Detector, built at Freiburg Univer-
sity, and of the Medipix2 readout and calibration system is given in Section 2.
In Section 3.1, results obtained with the 55Fe source, including charge spec-

troscopy measurements using the dual threshold capability of the Medipix2
digital readout, are described. In Section 3.2, results obtained with electrons
from the 106Ru source are summarized. They include the measurement of the
spatial resolution for primary ionization clusters in Ar/CO2 and He/CO2
gas mixtures. Finally, long-term stability and operational experience with the
present setup is discussed.

2 The Triple-GEM / Medipix2 Detector

2.1 Experimental Setup

The Triple-GEM/Medipix2 detector, built at Freiburg University, consists of
three cascaded GEM multiplication stages coupled to a multi-pixel ASIC de-
veloped at CERN (“Medipix2”) with individual pixels that amplify, discrimi-
nate and count individual hits [22],[23]. The chip is designed and manufactured
in a six-metal 0.25 µm CMOS technology. Fig. 1 shows the schematic layout
of the setup and the enlarged photo of the Medipix2 ASIC.

Fig. 1. (Left) A schematic drawing of the GEM/Medipix2 detector. ED, ET and
EI are the drift, transfer and induction ﬁeld, respectively. (Right) Enlarged photo
of Medipix2 pixel cells; a 25 µm wide conductive bump bond openings, used for
electron collection, are seen as a matrix of dots.

10 cm2 size,
The CERN-produced GEMs with double-conical holes, of 10
have a standard thickness of 50 µm with holes, arranged in a hexagonal pat-
tern, of 140 µm pitch and 70 µm diameter (in Cu). Application of a suitable
voltage diﬀerence between the metal layers of the GEM produces a strong
100 kV/cm), where the gas ampliﬁcation

occurs. In multiple GEM structures there are 3 diﬀerent electron drift regions:
in our setup, the drift gap (where the primary electrons are created) of 6
mm has been chosen, while the transfer region (between successive GEMs)
and the induction gap (between the last GEM and readout plane) are 2 and
10 cm2 charge collection plane consists of 25
1 mm, respectively. The 10
pads, each connected to a discrete preampliﬁer-discriminator chain, developed
for the L3 Forward Muon Detector [24]. Into one of the pads (approximately
1.8 cm2), a “naked” Medipix2 chip (without a silicon detector bonded)
1.8
is inserted (see Fig. 2). The Medipix2 sensitive area is arranged as a square
55 µm2 size, resulting in a detection area
matrix of 256
of 1.98 cm2 which represents 87 % of the entire surface area. The periphery,
placed at one side of the chip, includes the I/O control logic, 13 8-bit DACs
and 127 IO wire-bonding pads, arranged in a single row [22],[23]. The output
of the Medipix2 preampliﬁer feeds two identical discriminator branches (low
and high thresholds), which can be set independently. Each pixel contains
an 8bit conﬁguration register. Six bits are used for the threshold equalization
(three-bits for each discriminator), one for masking noisy pixels and one to en-
able the test input pulse through the 8 fF-on-pixel capacitor. Using the serial
or parallel readout interface, the readout of the whole pixel matrix containing
measured data takes 9 ms or 266 µs, respectively, for a 100 MHz clock.

256 pixels of 55

×

×

Approximately 75 % of each pixel is covered with an insulating passivation
layer. Thus electrical ﬁeld lines end on the conductive bump-bonding pads
(octagonally shaped, 25 µm wide) exposed to the gas (see Fig. 1 (right)).
Only electrons moving in the induction gap contribute to the signal. The time
development of the signal is fast as the transit time of electrons in 1 mm
induction gap is approximately 20 ns. The signal at the Medipix2 input is
proportional to the charge, which is collected on the bump-bonding pad in

4

each pixel. This makes use of Medipix2 ASIC as a charge collecting anode and
the pixel segmented readout of a GEM detector, allowing a true 2D image
reconstruction.

2.2 Medipix2 data readout and calibration

The Medipix2 chip was controlled and read out by the MUROS2 electron-
ics [25] and the software “Medisoft 4.0” developed by University of Naples [26].
Using a clock of 50 MHz in our setup, the pixel matrix was readout in about
20 ms in serial mode. To minimize the impact of threshold non-uniformity
across the channels, the optimization of the Medipix2 settings in Freiburg in-
volved the equalization of low (T HL) and high (T HH) thresholds by applying
an external test pulse to the on-pixel 8 fF injection capacitance [23]. Using a
pixel test input a threshold scan for a ﬁxed pulse charge is performed to mea-
sure S-shaped curves for each channel: from no pixel counts (0 % eﬃciency) to
100 % hits for low threshold (T HL) and, for larger input charges, from 100 %
eﬃciency to no counts for the high threshold (T HH). The threshold disper-
sion between pixels is tuned based on the 50 %-eﬃciency point of the S-curve
using the 3-bit-DAC available in each discrimination branch. The diﬀerence
in charge corresponding to 97.7 % and 2.3 % of the S-function, divided by
factor of four, is used as a measure of the equivalent noise charge (ENC) of
the pixel analog section, assuming a Gaussian distribution.

A dedicated study was performed in order to obtain an absolute calibration of
the Medipix2 chip - to match low and high threshold DAC settings (T HL and
T HH) to the corresponding eﬀective charges in electrons (qT HL and qT HH ).
In conventional Medipix setup the chip is connected to a Si semiconductor
detector allowing direct energy calibration with radioactive sources. For our
applications - we used a “naked” Medipix2 chip without X-ray converter -
calibration can only be performed using the electrical input pulse. In a ﬁrst
input (in e−) appearing at the ampliﬁer input can
step, the resulting charge Qtest
be estimated as a function of applied voltage step ∆V :

where 0.825 is the ampliﬁcation of the analog buﬀers used to transmit the
external test pulse to each pixel.

Since it is known, that the behavior of the input buﬀers of the charge injection
circuit is non-linear for large input voltages (> 100 mV) we correct the ob-
tained threshold charges Qtest
input in Eq. 1 for the measured diﬀerence in response
between various gamma sources and injected test pulses for another Medipix2

ASIC, bonded to a 300µm wafer of silicon [27]. From this procedure, we obtain
calibration curves for the T HL and T HH DAC values shown in Fig. 3. Ap-
plying the threshold equalization and using this calibration, we estimate the
minimum operational low threshold qT HL in our setup to be approximately
990 electrons with an uncertainty of 140 electrons, resulting from the linear
extrapolation of the calibration curve in Fig. 3.

3 Measurements and Results

The performance of the Triple-GEM / Medipix2 detector was studied with
55Fe X-Rays and 106Ru electrons. The 55Fe 5.9 keV X-ray produces an ion-
ization cluster in the detector volume, corresponding to approximately 220
primary electrons in Ar/CO2. The 106Ru source emits electrons with a max-
imum kinetic energy of 3.54 MeV from the decay of Rh106, which leaves
the ionization track with approximately 60 (20) primary electrons per cm
in Ar/CO2 (He/CO2) mixtures (see Table 1).

3.1 55Fe X-rays in Ar/CO2 (70:30)

The GEM/Medipix2 detector system, was exposed to 55Fe X-rays, entering
the detector through the cathode drift electrode (see Fig. 1 (left)). Most of the
X-rays are converted in the drift gap in Ar/CO2 (70:30) mixture emitting a
photo-electron, which produces a short ionization track in the gas. The cloud
of primary electrons from the track drift through the multi-GEM structure,
where they are multiplied and then collected on the input pads of Medipix2
chip (see Fig. 1 (right)). Standard high voltage settings for Ar/CO2 (70:30)
operation were: drift ﬁeld ED = 1.1 kV/cm, transfer ﬁeld ET = 3.2 kV/cm,

The Medipix2 chip does not provide pulse height information, but it can be
operated in the charge window mode [22]. In this operation mode, the detected
electron charge in each pixel is ampliﬁed and then compared with Medipix2
low (qT HL) and high (qT HH ) thresholds that form eﬀectively a charge window
∆W = qT HH
qT HL. If the detected charge falls inside this window (∆W ) a
13-bit digital counter is incremented. With a digital readout in charge window
mode, the 55Fe conversions are seen as “donuts” of diﬀerent sizes, according
to the deposited energy. Fig. 4 (left) shows images of 55Fe quanta conver-
sions, acquired without external trigger during approximately 1 s of Medipix2
acquisition time. To record this image the eﬀective low and high thresholds
12000 e−
were set to: qT HL
(DAC T HH value = 20), respectively (see Fig.3). A sample of 55Fe images was
collected with these settings. Fig. 4 (right) reveals clear peaks in the distri-
butions of inner (rT HH) and outer (rT HL) radius of nearly circular “donuts”,
which correspond to photoelectric conversions of 5.9 keV X-rays, with tails
mostly coming from Ar-escape electrons and background events.

The operation of the Medipix2 ASIC in the charge window mode also allows
us to perform an estimation of the total cluster charge in “donuts”. The proce-
dure is illustrated in Fig. 5. Assuming a conical shape of the charge cloud (the
assumption of a more realistic Gaussian proﬁle would not alter the results sig-
niﬁcantly) and using the inner (rT HH) and outer (rT HL) radius of the “donut”
for the corresponding settings of low (qT HL) and high (qT HH) thresholds, the

Fig. 6 represents the distribution of the total cluster charge Q deposited by
55Fe 5.9 keV X-rays. The Ar-escape peak and photo-peak are clearly visible
and separated. The energy resolution of the “charge spectroscopy” method is
approximately 20% full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) for an X-ray en-
ergy of 5.9 keV. By varying voltage across GEMs, the eﬀective gas gain was
determined from the central value of the photo-peak in the cluster charge
distribution and the assumption that 55Fe quanta generate 220 primary elec-
trons in Ar/CO2. The results shown in Fig. 7 are very similar to the absolute
gain calibration, derived from the measurement of the current for a known
radiation ﬂux in [28].

106Ru electron tracks in Ar/CO2 (70:30) and He/CO2 (70:30)

With the GEM/Medipix2 detector we collected a sample of tracks from a
radioactive 106Ru β−-source for two diﬀerent gas mixtures, Ar/CO2 (70:30)
105
and He/CO2 (70:30). The gas gains were 6
(∆VGEM =428 V) for the Ar and He-based mixtures, respectively. To record
track images a four-fold coincidence of conventional readout pads in a row,
with a pixel chip positioned between them, was used to trigger the Medipix2
readout (see Fig. 8). For these measurements, the chip was operated in a single
discrimination mode (only low THL threshold was used).

(70:30) is illustrated in Fig.9 (left) along with a straight line ﬁt to the re-
constructed centers of clusters in Fig.9 (right). The recorded electron track
consists of clearly visible extended charge clusters. The observed cluster size
varies considerably due to the ﬂuctuating number of primary ionization elec-
trons per cluster and variations in the gas multiplication. The average spatial
extent of charge clouds on the Medipix2 surface depends on the sizes of the
transfer and induction gaps and the electric ﬁelds strength ET , EI and ∆VGEM .
The distribution of the RMS spread of the cluster centers from a straight line
track is mainly determined by the electron diﬀusion in the drift region. Fig. 10

mately 20 % (45 %). Due to the ﬂuctuations in the multiplication process in
the GEMs we do not attempt to estimate the single electron eﬃciency at this
stage. However, it is obvious that the single electron eﬃciency is non-zero. In
particular, for He/CO2 mixture only 3.2 multi-electron clusters are expected
on average along a 1.4 cm track (see Table 2), to be compared with N obs

In the following data analysis we focus on the achievable single point resolution
with the digital readout of the GEM/Medipix2 detector. The following criteria
were applied to select events, which were included in this analysis:

A cluster is deﬁned as a set of more than 4 adjacent hit pixels;
The distance between two neighbored track clusters has to be smaller than
50 pixels (both in x and y directions);
More than 5 clusters per track are required;
Events with multiple tracks are rejected.

A total of several hundred tracks were selected by this procedure for Ar/CO2
and He/CO2 gases. First, we perform a two-dimensional straight line ﬁt to
the cluster centers and calculate the distance between each cluster center and
the position of the point of closest approach along the ﬁtted track. The corre-
sponding distributions, when all Ncl cluster centers are included in the track
ﬁt, are shown in Fig. 11. The standard deviations, σN , of a Gaussian ﬁt to
2 µm
the residual distributions gives 64
for He/CO2 (70:30) gas mixtures (see Table 3). In a second step, we repeat
this procedure but omitting the cluster under consideration from the track ﬁt.
The corresponding distributions, when the track ﬁt is performed to Ncl
1
clusters, is shown in Fig. 12. The standard deviations, σN −1, are 84
3 µm and
3 µm, respectively. An unbiased estimate for the single point resolution

In addition to inelastic collisions with atomic electrons, a few MeV 106Ru elec-

be clearly seen from the image of a “curved” electron track in Fig. 10 (right).

Despite the large width of charge clouds (
10 pixels) in the GEM/Medipix2
readout plane (see Fig. 9), this result demonstrates the possibility to achieve
spatial resolution of the order of the pixel width, based on the centroid deter-
mination method and digital Medipix2 readout.

4 Long-Term Stability

A very attractive feature of the GEM is that it allows to completely decouple
charge amplifying region (GEM) from the collecting electrodes - printed cir-
cuit board, which operate at a unity gain. To date, no single Medipix2 chip,
exposed to an induction ﬁeld of ED
4 kV/cm, has been destroyed due to
∼
the electrostatic or GEM discharges in our triple GEM setup after several
months of operation during the time-span of more than one year. No damage
to a pixel VLSI analog chip used as a direct anode of single GEM has been
also observed in [8]. This proves that the reliable operation can be established
for GEM gas ampliﬁcation coupled to Si-pixel readout and that the propa-
gation of destructive discharges to the sensitive CMOS electronics is strongly
suppressed even at large gas gains of 104

105.

5 Summary

The Medipix2 chip, being originally developed for a single photon counting,
has been successfully adapted as a highly integrated pixel-segmented anode
readout of a gas-ﬁlled detector, using a triple-GEM as a charge-multiplier.
The CMOS readout concept oﬀers the possibility of pixel sizes small enough
to observe individual primary electron clusters of minimum ionizing particle
tracks and to provide real two-dimensional images of physics events. The ap-
proach holds a great potential for high-precision particle tracking at the next
generation of high energy physics colliders and for astrophysical applications.

To evaluate the GEM/Medipix2 performance, we have carried out studies
with 55Fe and 106Ru sources. The Triple-GEM / Medipix2 detector allows to
perform energy-sensitive charge spectroscopy measurements (20 % FWHM at
5.9 keV X-rays) using only digital readout and two discriminator thresholds. In
the tracking applications, the detector has been shown to achieve an excellent
50 µm, based on the binary centroid determination
spatial resolution of
1.5 cm
of the charge clouds, and allows to reconstruct tracks as short as
length.

For the ILC applications the use of CMOS pixel ASIC in the TPC readout
plane will allow to observe individual electron clusters in 3D and fully exploit
unprecedented 3D-granularity for the gaseous tracking and to minimize the
material in the endplate, since front-end electronics is naturally integrated
into the readout pad plane. A modiﬁcation of the Medipix2 chip (“TimePix”)
to measure also the drift time information of primary electrons is under de-
velopment [32],[33]. This will enable to measure not only the 2D projection,
but also to reconstruct the true 3D-space points of charged particles crossing
a large TPC volume. The possibility to use time-over-threshold information
for time-walk correction and charge estimation are also foreseen in the chip
design.

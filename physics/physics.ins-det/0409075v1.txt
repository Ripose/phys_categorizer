We describe the design and functionality of the cosmic ray teststand built at INFN
Lecce for ATLAS RPC quality control assurance.

ABSTRACT

1 Introduction

Resistive Plate Chamber ( RPC [1] ) will be used as the muon trigger detector, in
the barrel region of the ATLAS experiment at LHC [2]. Good high pt muon trigger
performance is crucial in order to address the broad physics program of LHC.
In order to cover the barrel region a total number of 1116 RPC units will be installed,
for a total surface area of about 3800 m2. The extreme diﬃculty in accessing the
ATLAS detectors, after installation is complete, imposes a high standard Quality
Assurance for these units. For this purpose three cosmic ray teststands have been
built at INFN Napoli[3], Lecce, and Roma 2, each one allowing to certify a tower of
eight RPC units at once. The Lecce site uses a standalone cosmic ray trigger and
tracking system built with 4 pre-tested ATLAS units ( Figure 1 ). The advantages
of this setup is a complete coverage of the chambers under test, avoiding time
consuming position scans, allowing only one readout system, and to monitor RPC
behaviors in the long term for the trigger chambers.

2 Experimental setup and software components

Our apparatus consists of several subsystems: gas distribution, high voltage distri-
bution, low voltage distribution, trigger logic, VME readout, and data acquisition.
A large number of independent gas lines (one for each gas volume layer), high volt-
age and low voltage channels (one for each readout panel) are present, in order to
easily isolated defective detectors.
The cosmic rays are selected with a loose trigger request and further reﬁned on-line
requiring a minimum number of hits in the trigger RPC, resulting in an acquisition
rate of about 50 Hz. Events are than analized looking for straight tracks (85% of
the events contain good track candidates). Those tracks are then used for eﬃciency
computation of the RPCs under test and monitoring purposes.
The monitor, control, and readout sofware is based on Labview, while, the analysis
software is written in object oriented C++ language. In addition, conﬁgurations,
runs and results are managed by MySQL databases and presented via web interface.
Finally, the data are displayed by PAW and ROOT macro’s.

3 Quality control tests

The certiﬁcation of the chambers is accomplished by a sequence of several mea-
surements: a gas volume leak test, a HV ramp-up and ramp-down current curves,
eﬃciency versus high voltage (at diﬀerent front-end voltage threshold values), single
rate counts versus front-end voltage thresholds (at diﬀerent high voltage values),
and ﬁnally, chamber tomography. The whole procedure (both for on-line and oﬀ-
line DAQ processing) is almost automatic, takes about 24 hours, and starts after

2-days of gas ﬂowing (94.7%C2H2F4-5%C4H10-0.3%SF6).
During the gas volume leak test the diﬀerential pressure is monitored for two hours

after imposing about 3 mbar of over-pressure and closing the gas inlet and oulet.
The runs with cosmic ray triggers (plateau curves and tomography plot) and with
random trigger (noise rates) allow a complete characterization of the chambers. Up
to now we tested about 100 units. Accepted chambers should have high gap ef-
ﬁciency (> 97% where about 2% loss can be accounted due to the spacers) and
relatively low single rate counts (about 1 Hz
cm2 , much less than the expected ATLAS
cavern background). Figure 2 shows a gas volume RPC tomography obtained with
our system, proving the good 3D tracking capability of ATLAS RPC’s (about 7
mm projected track spatial resolution in both projections). In fact, localized dead
regions, due to the 1 cm diameter spacers, are clearly visible. Moreover, the current
versus high voltage allows to detect defective gap, looking for large leakage current.

The cosmic ray teststand at INFN Lecce is now capable of routinely testing ATLAS
RPC detector units. Its complexity is such that the system is a good test bench for
operating with a large number of RPC’s.

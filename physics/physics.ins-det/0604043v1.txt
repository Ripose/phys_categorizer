Abstract

The use of nuclear emulsions in very large physics experiments is now possible
thanks to the recent improvements in the industrial production of emulsions and
to the development of fast automated microscopes. In this paper the hardware
performances of the European Scanning System (ESS) are described. The ESS is
a very fast automatic system developed for the mass scanning of the emulsions of
the OPERA experiment, which requires microscopes with scanning speeds of ∼ 20
cm2/h in an emulsion volume of 44 µm thickness.

1 Introduction

Nuclear emulsions record tracks
of charged particles with an accuracy
of less than 1 µm. Thanks to this
feature, they were largely used in
nuclear and particle physics exper-
iments during the last century [1,2]
and they are still successfully used
nowadays, especially in experiments
involving short-lived particles [3,4,5].
The amount of emulsions used in
the early experiments was relatively
small and the measurements were
made manually. Signiﬁcant improve-
ments in the emulsion technique and
the development of fast automated
scanning systems during the last two
decades [6,7,8] have made possible
the use of nuclear emulsions in large
scale experiments.

OPERA is a long baseline ex-
periment [9] (located in the INFN
Gran Sasso Underground Labora-
tories) which will use a hybrid de-
tector to search for νµ → ντ os-
cillations in the parameter range
suggested by atmospheric neutrino
experiments [10,11,12]. The goal
is
to observe the appearance of τ lep-
tons in a pure νµ beam produced at
the CERN-SPS (the CNGS neutrino
beam [13]). The τ leptons are identi-
ﬁed through the direct detection of

their decays that, at the CNGS ener-
gies, are at distances of ∼ 1 mm from
the production point. Therefore, a
high precision detector is needed. On
the other hand, given the smallness
of the neutrino oscillation probabil-
ity and of the neutrino cross-section
a very massive detector (O(kton))
is mandatory. The Emulsion Cloud
Chamber (ECC) [14], a sandwich of
dense passive material (Pb) sheets,
acting as target,
interleaved with
emulsion sheets, acting as high pre-
cision trackers, satisﬁes the need of
both a large mass and a high pre-
cision tracking capability. The ECC
technique has lead to the ﬁrst ob-
servation of ντ
interactions by the
DONUT experiment [5].

The OPERA detector is a hy-
brid system consisting of electronic
trackers, muon spectrometers and
a massive lead-emulsion target seg-
mented into ECC bricks, each with
size 12.7×10.2×7.5 cm3. Emulsion
sheets are made of two 44 µm thick
ﬁlms (including 1 µm insensitive pro-
tective layer) coated on both sides of
a 205 µm thick plastic support [15].
Electronic detectors are used to
identify the brick where the neu-
trino interaction occurred. The brick
is then removed and two external
emulsion sheets placed downstream
of the brick (changeable sheets) are
promptly detached and analyzed to
conﬁrm the interaction.

With the CNGS neutrino beam [13]
at its nominal intensity, ∼ 30 neu-
trino selected interactions per day

2

are expected. Therefore, ∼ 2000
emulsion sheets per day must be
(partially) scanned in order to ﬁnd
the vertex and analyze the event. In
total, ∼ 6000 cm2 per day (∼ 200 cm2
per brick) have to be analyzed with
a sub-micrometric precision per 5
years of data taking (& 30000 neu-
trino interactions).

The need for a daily scanning
of all neutrino interactions comes
from the goal to analyze in “real”
time the events and, for some de-
cay topologies, remove other ECC
bricks for a more reﬁned kinemat-
ical analysis. Consequently, a very
fast automatic scanning system is
needed to cope with the daily anal-
ysis of the large number of emulsion
sheets associated with neutrino in-
teractions. In order to have a rea-
sonable number of microscopes (∼
1 microscope/brick/day), the min-
imum required scanning speed is
about 20 cm2/h per emulsion layer
(44 µm thick). It corresponds to an
increase in speed by more than one
order of magnitude with respect to
past systems [6,8].

For this purpose new automatic
fast microscopes have been devel-
oped: the European Scanning Sys-
tem (ESS) [16,17] and the S-UTS in
Japan [7].

In this paper the features and
performances of the ESS hardware
are discussed. High speed particle
tracking for the ESS is described in
Ref. [16,17], precision measurements
in Ref. [18], alignments with cosmic
ray muons in Ref. [19], items related
to event analysis in Ref. [20].

2 The design of the European

Scanning System

The main components of the mi-
croscope shown in Fig. 1 are: (i) a
high quality, rigid and vibration-free
support table holding the compo-
nents in a ﬁxed position; (ii) a mo-
tor driven scanning stage for hori-
zontal (XY) motion; (iii) a granite
arm which acts as an optical stand;
(iv) a motor driven stage mounted
vertically (Z) on the granite arm
for focusing; (v) optics; (vi) digital
camera for image grabbing mounted
on the vertical stage and connected
with a vision processor; (vii) an illu-
mination system located below the
scanning table. The emulsion sheet
is placed on a glass plate (emulsion
holder) and its ﬂatness is guaranteed
by a vacuum system which holds the
emulsion at a ﬁxed position during
the scanning.

By adjusting the focal plane of the
objective, the whole 44 µm emulsion
thickness is spanned and a sequence
of 15 tomographic images of each
ﬁeld of view, taken at equally spaced
depth levels, is obtained. Emulsion
images are digitized, converted into
a grey scale of 256 levels, sent to a
vision processor board, hosted in the
control workstation, and analyzed to
recognize sequences of aligned grains
(clusters of dark pixels of given
shape and size). Some of these spots
are track grains; others, in fact the
majority, are spurious grains (fog),
created in the emulsions by thermal
eﬀects and not associated to particle
tracks. The three-dimensional struc-
ture of a track in an emulsion layer
(microtrack )
reconstructed by
combining clusters belonging to im-

is

ages at diﬀerent levels and searching
for geometrical alignments (Fig. 2a).
Each microtrack pair is connected
across the plastic base to form the
base track (Fig. 2b).

A linear ﬁt to these clusters allows
the determination of the track posi-
tion and slope [16].

The ESS microscope has been
designed according to the following
speciﬁcations:
• high-speed

computer-controlled
precision mechanics for both hor-
izontal and vertical stages with
sub-micron accuracy able to move
from one ﬁeld of view to the next
in less than 0.1 s;

• optical system from standard mi-
croscopes, customized to observe
the OPERA emulsion sheets which
have two emulsion layers on both
sides of a plastic support for a to-

tal thickness of ∼ 300 µm. 2

• high-resolution camera interfaced
with a high-speed frame grabber
and a vision processor able to grab
and process images at rates > 350
frames per second (fps).
The ESS is based on the use of
commercial hardware components
or developed in collaboration with
specialized companies. The software
used for data taking and track recon-
struction has a modular structure,
providing the ﬂexibility needed to
upgrade the system following the
technological progress.

2 The conditions are completely diﬀer-
ent from typical ordinary cases: for in-
stance the microscopes normally used
in biology to observe few microns thick
specimens do not measure the vertical
dimension (image analyzers).

3 Mechanics

3.1 Horizontal stages

The scanning table and the ver-
tical stage have been developed in
collaboration with the Micos com-
pany 3 by modifying
commercial
products; they are equipped with
stepping motors “Vexta NanoStep
RFK Series 5-Phase Microstepping
System” produced by the Oriental
Motor company 4 . The motors are
driven by a 4-axis “FlexMotion PCI-
7344” board provided by National
Instruments 5 and inserted into the
host PC.

The ESS uses a Micos “MS-8”
scanning table with 20.5 cm range
in both directions. The coordinates
are read out by two linear encoders

with a resolution of 0.1 µm. External
optical limit switches are mounted
on each axis and manually set.

The motion of the horizontal stage
(maximum speed, acceleration, de-
celeration, ...) was set in order to
minimize the time needed to move
from one ﬁeld of view to the next
(typically ∼ 350 µm). The total dis-
placement time is given by the sum
of the rise time and the settling
time. The former is the time to ﬁrst
reach the “target point”, the latter
is the time needed to wait for the
oscillations to be damped to a pre-
deﬁned acceptable level which, for
our working conditions, is ±0.2 µm,
a value smaller than one image pixel
(0.3 µm). The measured time proﬁle
for the X axis, for a displacement of
350 µm, is shown in Fig. 3a, and the
corresponding
total displacement
time distribution is shown in Fig. 3b.
The X displacement can be safely
considered concluded within ∼ 100
ms (average value: 70 + 16 = 86 ms).
The time needed for the Y axis dis-
placements is larger (∼ 140 ms) due

to the scanning table design: the Y
movements involve the whole table,
while the X movements involve only
a lighter part of the table. Therefore,
the scanning procedure minimizes
the number of Y displacements.

The repeatability to reach a com-
manded position was evaluated by
moving the stage in the X (or Y) di-
rection, coming back each time to the
starting position. This test was car-
ried out with the motion parameters
indicated by the settling time opti-
mization and a step corresponding to
a ﬁeld-of-view change (∼ 350 µm).
The grey level “center of mass” of an
emulsion grain was used as reference
position; the results are shown in
Fig. 4. The RMS of the distribution
is < 0.1 µm. The data of Fig. 4, as
well as those of Figs. 7b and 10, were
ﬁtted to a gaussian form (solid lines);
the ﬁts, excluding some tails, are
generally good and their mean val-
ues and sigmas are essentially equal

to the experimental mean values and
RMSs.

3.2 Vertical stage

The vertical stage used by the ESS
is the Micos “LS-110” model. It is
equipped with a linear encoder (res-

olution 0.05 µm) and limit switches.
During data taking, the vertical stage
moves at constant speed calculated
by taking into account the camera
frame rate, the number of desired
frames and the emulsion thickness
(44 µm). With a frame rate of about
400 frames/s and 15 levels per emul-
sion layer, each image is acquired at
a vertical distance of about 3 µm; the
resulting speed is about 1150 µm/s;
the time needed to scan an emulsion
layer is about 55 ms (including the
time for acceleration, deceleration
and synchronization with the host).
The time for a cycle is thus ob-
tained by adding the time for hori-
zontal displacement (it includes the
time the vertical stage takes to reach
its starting position) and the time
needed for the data acquisition in Z.
The insertion of a synchronization
time of a few milliseconds before
and after the frame grabbing brings
to a ∼ 170 ms cycle time (Fig. 5).
As explained in Sect. 5, this value
is adequate to reach the requested
scanning speed.

4 Optical system

A schematic layout of the ESS op-

tical system is shown in Fig. 6.

The features and the quality of
the objective have to match the re-
quests of the scanning. The align-
ment of stages,
light source, glass
window, diaphragms and lenses must
be within 1 mrad in order to sat-
isfy the resolution requested by the
OPERA experiment (2 mrad) [9].
The intensity and color of the light
have to be adjusted to maximize the
image contrast. In the following sub-

sections the choice of the diﬀerent
elements are discussed.

4.1 Objective

The performances of the objective
should cope with the requirements of
a sub-micron resolution, the need to
focus at diﬀerent Z depths, a magni-
ﬁcation of few pixels per micron. An
objective is characterized by the nu-
merical aperture (N.A.), the working
distance (W.D.) and the magniﬁca-
tion (M). Moreover, an objective is
designed to operate (or not) in an oil-
immersion set-up.

The N.A. deﬁnes the ultimate im-
age resolution (the minimal distance
between two points seen as separate)
that can be achieved by the objec-
tive. Since sub-micron resolution is
needed, the objective is required to
have N.A. > 0.8 [21].

Given the overall thickness of the
emulsion layers and of the plastic
support (44 + 205 + 44 ) µm, a
W.D. > 0.3 mm is required.

When the system scans the bot-
tom emulsion layer, the whole plastic
support and the top emulsion layer
lay between the objective front lens
and the focal plane, for a total thick-
ness of 0.3 mm. For the scanning of
the top emulsion layer there is no in-
termediate medium. The main eﬀect
of changing an intermediate medium
thickness is to overcorrect or under-
correct the spherical aberration [21].
An oil-immersion objective is the
best choice since the oil, the emul-
sion and the plastic support have the
same refractive index (∼ 1.5) and
therefore the optical path is almost
homogeneous.

(grabbing of 15 frames at diﬀerent Z levels) are performed from A to B (∼ 55 ms).
The horizontal displacement in X lasts ∼ 90 ms; adding few ms before and after
frame grabbing leads to a full cycle of ∼ 170 ms.

pends on the image sensor size be-
cause an image with at least a few
pixels per micron is needed. In the
case of 20 mm wide megapixel sen-
sors (see discussion in Section 5.1),
an objective with M > 40 is needed.
However, the magniﬁcation should
not be much larger, in order not to
reduce the microscope speed.

These requirements are severe
and only few objectives fulﬁlling all
of them can be found on the mar-
ket. Our choice was the Nikon CFI
Plan Achromat 50x oil, N.A. = 0.9,
W.D. = 0.4 mm used in inﬁnity-
corrected system with a tube lens
housed in its trinocular tube.

It is worth mentioning that for the

OPERA experiment, where a very
large number of emulsion ﬁlms has
to be scanned daily, the oil immer-
sion objective is not the best practi-
cal choice. For this reason, an R&D
activity on dry objectives is still in
progress.

4.2 Illumination

A transmitted illumination sys-
tem is placed below the scanning
table. It was developed jointly with
Nikon-Italy; it was designed to ob-
tain the Koehler conﬁguration [21].
The light comes from a tungsten
halogen lamp with a computer con-
trolled power supply. The image of

the lamp ﬁlament is focused by a
lens (collector) on the aperture di-
aphragm of a condenser which con-
centrates the light into a cone that
illuminates the emulsion sheet. A
second diaphragm (ﬁeld diaphragm)
is adjusted to prevent emulsion illu-
mination (and also heating) outside
the ﬁeld of view. The condenser nu-
merical aperture should match that
of the objective in order to have a
wide illumination cone and an opti-
mal optical resolution. The emulsion
holder, described in the next section,
requires that the condenser working
distance is at least few mm.

The ﬁnal choice was a Nikon
achromatic condenser with N.A. =
0.8 and W.D. = 4.6 mm. A green
ﬁlter and a frosted glass diﬀuser are
inserted into the light path to obtain
an illumination as uniform as possi-
ble over the entire ﬁeld of view and
to maximize the optical resolution.

4.3 The emulsion holder and the

alignment

The angular resolution needed for
the ESS is few mrad; the systematic
error introduced in the angular mea-
surement by non-planarity of the
glass window (which holds the emul-
sion) and by misalignments between
the optical components and mechan-
ical stage, has to be kept well below
1 mrad.

The glass window, equipped with
a vacuum system to keep the emul-
sion steady during the scanning, is
4 mm thick (this is compatible with
the condenser working distance). It
has a thickness tolerance of less than
10 µm per 10 cm length and its devi-
ation from the parallelism is smaller
than 1 mrad; the ﬂatness is of a few
fringes per inch (∼ 0.5 µm per 1 cm).
A 1 mm wide groove in the glass along
the emulsion edge is connected to a

The stages and the optical axis
are aligned with respect to the glass
window (used as a reference plane).
The angles between the glass win-
dow and the horizontal and vertical
motion directions (angles α and β
in Fig. 7a) are adjusted with an ac-
curacy ≤ 0.1 mrad using a digital
micrometric comparator. The “right

using an autocollimator and the ﬁ-
nal alignment of the optical axis is
≤ 0.4 mrad (angle γ in Fig. 7a).
All the optical components shown in
Fig. 6 are aligned using a centering
telescope.

In order to estimate the system-
atic angular uncertainty, some emul-
sions were vertically exposed to a 10
GeV π− beam. Fig. 7b shows the dis-
tribution of the diﬀerence between
measured and reference track slopes.

The reference slopes have been ob-
tained by averaging the 2 slopes
before and after a 180◦ horizontal
rotation of the emulsion sheet; the
residual mean value of 0.5 mrad is
a good estimate of the systematic
uncertainty arising from possible
misalignments.

5 The acquisition system

5.1 Camera

The goal of 20 cm2/h scanning
speed requires a frame acquisition
time < 4 ms and megapixel resolu-
tions.

The ESS is equipped with a
high-speed

megapixel CMOS camera with Full
Camera Link interface. Its image sen-
sor is the Micron MT9M413 7 which
delivers up to 10-bit monochrome
1280 × 1024 images at over 500
frames per second. The sensor size
is 20 mm (along the diagonal) and
its pixels are 12×12 µm2 large. This
choice follows a detailed R&D work
with a custom FPGA-driven camera
equipped with the same sensor. This
study allowed to verify the sensor
suitability in terms of speed, stability
and image quality and to study and
implement techniques like look-up
tables, image correction, etc.

5.2 Grain image

The optical system and the CMOS
camera provide a suitable grain im-
age acquisition in terms of stability,
photometric dynamics and resolu-
tion. The sensor size, the objective
magniﬁcation and the setup condi-
tions give a ﬁeld of view of about
390×310 µm2 and image pixels of
about 0.3×0.3 µm2. Consequently,
the image of a focused grain is ∼ 10
pixels large. Fig. 8 shows a horizon-
tal grain image (top) and the re-
constructed vertical image (bottom)
(obtained by taking 20 images in
∼ 10 µm at a Z distance of 0.5 µm
one from the other). As indicated by
the grey level proﬁles on the left, a
focused grain can be acquired with
sub-micron resolution in the hori-
zontal (XY ) plane while its proﬁle
is spanned over 3-4 µm along the
vertical (Z) direction.

5.3 Image acquisition and on-line

processing board

The frame grabber and the image
processor are integrated in the same
board, a Matrox Odyssey Xpro 8 ,
speciﬁcally designed to perform on-
board image processing. The on-
board processor is a Motorola G4
PowerPC supported by a Matrox
custom parallel processor speciﬁcally
designed to quickly perform local
and point-to-point operations. It is
equipped with a 1 GB DDR SDRAM
memory; the internal I/O bandwidth
can achieve over 4 GB per second
transfer rate, while the external rate
reaches 1 GB per second. A Full
Camera Link connection allows an
acquisition rate from the camera of
up to 680 MB/s.

At present, a camera frame rate of
377 fps and 8-bit grey level images
are used corresponding to an acqui-
sition rate of 471 MB/s. By acquir-
ing 15 frames per 44 µm emulsion
layer, an acquisition time of about 40
ms is needed for each ﬁeld of view.
Considering a synchronization time
of 15 ms, a mean time of ∼ 90 ms
for the ﬁeld of view change, a ﬁeld
of view of about 390×310 µm2 and a
superimposition between contiguous
ﬁelds of 30 µm, a scanning speed of
about 22 cm2/h is obtained. The ef-
fective scanning speed is a bit lower
(∼ 20 cm2/h) because sometimes the
microscope has to scan the full sheet
thickness to ﬁnd the emulsion sur-
faces (focusing). For precision mea-
surements [18] or in particular appli-

cations, the microscope can be used
with other objectives and camera res-
olutions; the scanning speed changes
accordingly.

The selected exposure time is lim-
ited by grain size (∼ 1 µm) and by
vertical resolution (∼ 3 µm). There-
fore, the exposure time should be
smaller than the time needed to span
1 µm. In our working condition the

exposure time is smaller than 0.5 ms
(the exposure time depends on the
microscope and it ranges between
0.15 and 0.5 ms).

Once grabbed, each image is an-
alyzed using image processing tech-
niques like ﬁlters, binarization and
clustering (for more details see [16]);
the grains are recognized as clusters
of black pixels. The number of clus-

ters available for tracking depends on
the threshold and on the selection cut
in the cluster area. The distribution
of the clusters area in one emulsion
layer image is shown in Fig. 9a. The
cluster area as a function of the dis-
tance from the grain center-of-mass
is shown in the Fig. 9b. The eﬃciency
and the precision in grain ﬁnding de-
pend on the cut in the cluster area
(a lower area cut yields a lower pre-
cision and a higher grain ﬁnding eﬃ-
ciency). Taking into account the ac-
quisition speed and the Z level dis-
tances (∼ 3 µm) the cluster area cut
is chosen in order to maximize the
grain ﬁnding eﬃciency (normally 3 or
4 pixels).

6 Results and conclusions

As already described in a previous
paper [16], the tracking algorithm
searches for a straight sequence of
grains at diﬀerent Z levels. Starting
from ∼ 2000 clusters on each level

and 15 levels for each emulsion layer,
100 ÷ 400 track segments (micro-
tracks) are found in a volume cor-
responding to the ﬁeld of view and
the 44 µm thickness of the emulsion
layer. The number of
fake tracks
reconstructed (mainly due to com-
binatorial background) is strongly
reduced by connecting two micro-
tracks across the plastic base (base
tracks). Conventional statistical se-
lection criteria ﬁnally reduce the in-
strumental background at the level
of 1 fake base track/cm2.

Fig. 10 shows the residuals be-
tween microtrack slopes and base
track slopes of a typical analysis us-
ing 10 GeV/c π− beam. The micro-
track ﬁnding eﬃciency evaluated af-
ter track reconstruction over several
emulsion plates is above 95% over
the [0, 700] mrad angular range.

The European Scanning System
has reached the planned speed of
∼ 20 cm2/h. This represents an im-
provement of more than an order

Abstract. Most of the physics analyses at a hadron collider rely on a precise measurement of the
energy of jets in the ﬁnal state. This requires a precise in situ calibration of the calorimeter with
the ﬁnal detector setup. We present the basic procedure and results of the in situ gain calibration of
the D0 HCAL in Run II. The gain calibration works on top of the pulser-based calibration of the
readout electronics and is based entirely on collision data.

INTRODUCTION

The detailed description of the DØ Calorimeter can be found in Run I and Run II
instrumentation papers [1, 2]. Let us brieﬂy summarize some of its basic aspects.

The DØ calorimeter is segmented into towers in h

and f . The precision towers
divide the calorimeter in 64 segments in the f and 72 segments in the h -direction. Each
precision tower consists of four physical layers in the EM part and four or more physical
layers in the hadronic part. The calorimeter is also divided into trigger towers, which are
2x2 arrays of precision towers, dividing the calorimeter into 32 segments in f , and 37 in
h

. Trigger towers are the smallest calorimeter units seen by the Level 1 trigger.
We distinguish a central section covering pseudorapidities |h | up to ≈ 1.1, and two
end calorimeters (EC) that extend coverage to |h | ≈ 4.2, with all three housed in separate
cryostats, Fig.1. These are sampling LAr calorimeters with mainly Uranium absorber
plates. A calorimeter basic unit consists of a 3 mm thick plate of an absorber material,
2.3 mm liquid Argon gap and a signal board consisting of a Copper pad surrounded
by G10 insulator coated with high resistivity epoxy. The absorber is grounded and the
pad is kept at positive voltage of 2000 V. Charge induced at the pads gives the physical
signal. The electron drift time across the 2.3 mm gap is approximately 450 ns.

Although for Run II the calorimeter itself is unchanged from Run I, the charge
integration time has been reduced from ∼2.2 m s in Run I to ∼260 ns in Run II,
resulting in an enhanced sensitivity to the ﬁnite mechanical precision of the calorimeter.
Additional mechanical boundaries like module edges, any non-uniformities in the LAr
gap and Uranium plate widths or possible board bendings are directly related to the
amount of charge collected and the response of the modules and cells. In adittion, the
associated readout electronics have been largely redesigned to address the need for a
shorter shaping and readout time and the need for analog buffering to store the data until
a Level 1 Trigger decision becomes available.

FIGURE 1.

The Run II upgrade strongly inﬂuenced the calorimeter in an indirect way as well.
The amount of dead material in front of the calorimeter increased signiﬁcantly with
the upgrade and it is non-uniformly distributed. This material comes from pre-shower
detectors, the solenoid, ﬁber tracker and silicon vertex detector. Together with the cryo-
stat walls the particles traverse at least of 3.7 X0 before they reach the calorimeter. The
amount of dead material depends also signiﬁcantly on the angle of incidence of the
measured particles and increases with the pseudo-rapidity.

Due to this signiﬁcant changes for the upgrade, the calorimeter had to be calibrated
again. Moreover, it was essential to obtain a calorimeter Run II calibration in situ with
the ﬁnal detector setup.

CALIBRATION PROCEDURE

The calibration procedure for the DØ calorimeter contains two parts: calibration of
the readout electronics using pulser data, and correction of non-uniformities due to
mechanical variations in the detector using collision data.

The basic idea of the electronics calibration is to send a pulse of known charge into
the readout, and to compare it to the measured charge. In this way we identify technical
problems in the electronics, e.g. dead channels and correct for the channel-by-channel
differences in the response. Pulses of different heights are used to probe the full dynamic
range of every readout channel. In this way, the response of every single channel can be
linearized, and the gains of the different channels can be equalized.

The gain calibration of the DØ calorimeter factorize into two parts: the calibration
of the EM calorimeter and the calibration of the hadronic calorimeter. For this two
parts of the calorimeter we determine the energy scale (i.e. a multiplicative correction

factor), if possible per cell. Both parts of the calorimeter have been calibrated in two
steps. First, the f -intercalibration to reduce the number of degrees of freedom, where
special triggered Run II data was used. Second, the h -intercalibration to get access to
the remaining degrees of freedom, as well as the absolute scale of the EM calorimeter.
For the h -intercalibration we used Z → e+e− events for the EM calorimeter and QCD
dijet events for the hadronic calorimeter.

The best standard candle for the absolute calibration of the EM calorimeter is the Z-
peak, which is well known from LEP measurements. However, we lack of statistics to
use the Z-peak alone in calibrating on a tower or cell level. Therefore we used special
triggered EM data to intercalibrate over rings of ﬁxed h
. Once the f -degree of freedom
is eliminated, the amount of Z events is sufﬁciently high to absolutely calibrate each
intercalibrated h -ring.

For this purpose the reconstructed Z mass is written in terms of the electron energies
and their opening angle. The electron energies are evaluated as the raw energy measure-
ment from the calorimeter plus a parametrized energy-loss correction from a detailed
detector simulation. Calibration constants are multiplicative to the raw cluster energy of
each cell. A set of calibration constants is then determined that minimize the experimen-
tal resolution on the Z mass and gives the correct LEP measured value. After the fully
calibrated EM calorimeter, we address the calibration of the hadronic part.

f -INTERCALIBRATION OF THE DØ HCAL

Due to the fact that the p ¯p beams in the Tevatron are unpolarized, the energy ﬂow in the
direction transverse to the beam should not have any azimuthal dependence. Based on
this, we can use an energy ﬂow method with the following basic principle:

Consider in each case a given h -bin of the calorimeter. Measure the density of
calorimeter objects above a given ET threshold as a function of f . With a perfect
detector this density would be ﬂat in f . Assuming that any f -non-uniformities are due
to energy scale variations, the uniformity of the detector can be improved by applying
multiplicative calibration factors to the energies of the calorimeter objects in each f -
region in such a way that the candidate density becomes ﬂat in f .

A special

trigger was designed to record efﬁciently data for the hadronic f -
intercalibration. It requires a transverse energy threshold of 5 GeV in the Trigger
Tower at Level 1, then it requires at Level 2 that 5 GeV is in the hadronic part of the
tower and ﬁnally it tightens the hadronic transverse energy cut for a Precision Tower
at Level 3 to 7 GeV. Data for the f -intercalibration was taken during normal physics
running. The quality of the recorded data was studied in detail to separate failures
in redout electronics from gain miscalibrations. Systematic uncertainties from trigger
non-unifomities were avoided by placing trigger and ofﬂine cuts sufﬁciently above the
trigger conditions.

The task of deriving f -intercalibration constants for cells in towers at given h

is

divided into the two following steps:

• Finding a tower calibration constant, which is a multiplicative factor for all cells in
the tower, such that tower occupancies above an ET threshold are equalized in f .

FIGURE 2. Spread of calibration constants for the ﬁrst hadronic layer of the calorimeter. The constants
are separately plotted for the central, EC inner-hadronic part.

• Fitting layer calibration constants, which then intercalibrate cells within the tower.
This is performed using cell energy fraction distribution shapes which are compared
to the f -averaged reference shape.

Since the above two steps inﬂuence each other, the procedure of layer and tower cali-
bration has to be iterated until stability is reached. The ﬁnal f -intercalibration constants
are the products of these layer and tower constants.

With the calibration method described, calibration constants on cell level have been
determined for the whole h
region with available trigger information (up to |h | of 3.2).
Due to statistical limitations in our calibration data sample, for the inter cryostat region
and for the region of |h | above 2.4 a calibration on tower level is used only.

In Fig. 2, as an example, the spread of the calibration constants is plotted for the
ﬁrst hadronic layers of the detector separated into two regions: central calorimeter and
EC inner hadronic calorimeter. The calibration constants are mainly in the range of
0.90-1.15 and the root mean squares are at the order of 0.05. Calibration constants are
slightly smaller for the central region compared to the EC and for the ﬁrst hadronic layer
compared to the other hadronic layers. The plots of the spread of constants have tails
resulting from outliers with higher constants. For the central calorimeter this is mainly
due to a single module, whose contribution is plotted separately with dotted lines. In the
EC inner hadronic part this outliers are from the region of higher h ’s with the lack of
statistics. In these regions only a calibration on tower level is aimed anyway.

The error estimation was done with a MC method: we generate toy simulations of the
data with known miscalibrations and compare to the ﬁtted calibration constants of our
calibration procedure. The central calorimeter is now calibrated with the precision of the
order of 1%, for the high h -regions it is a few per cent.

In general the energy response of the modules is less uniform than it was in Run I. The
dominant reason for this is the short integration time in Run II. This ampliﬁes the effect
of the ﬁnite precision of the calorimeter modules. The electron drift time across the 2.3
mm LAr gap is at the order of 450 ns. While in Run I the integration time was essentially
“inﬁnite” on the time scale of this drift time, with the shorter Run II integration time we

This is illustrated in three examples, where three extreme cases have been choosen.
One is a whole module out of the 16 modules in the central calorimeter which has a low
response, thus had to be boosted up. As an example we present Fig. 3(a), the calibration
constants at h of -0.3, but the same pattern is visible in the whole ﬁne hadronic central
calorimeter. The spread of calibration constants due to this module is plotted in Fig.2,
(dashed line).

In addition, the effect at the edges of this module is stronger and such cells need to
be boosted more than at the center of the module. This kind of charge collection effects
do not only concern this particular module, they are also visible throughout the hadronic
calorimeter. At a closer look to Fig. 3(a), a similar pattern can be recognized for all
the modules included in the discussed plot. The same inefﬁcient charge collection is
clearly visible in some cells of the end cap calorimeter which are at the boundaries of
this calorimeter section. The effects are strongly enhanced by the additional calorimeter
borders. An example is plotted in Fig. 3(b) for the h -ring at -1.6.

The inner hadronic calorimeter was built on one module, thus charge collection effects
in the inner hadronic part are of different kind compared to the central part. The inner
hadronic modules and absorption layers have been mounted together from half-circles.
These modules and absorption layers are oriented within ±90o with respect to each other
to obtain a structure without any gaps. Charge collection effects due to these rotated
semi-circles are visible in the calibration constants. An example is plotted in Fig. 3(c)
for the h -ring at -2.4. Four groups consisting of two constants need to be boosted up due
to charge collection effects.

h -INTERCALIBRATION OF THE DØ HCAL

The next step in our calibration procedure is the h -intercalibration, where we determine
overall calibration factors for each h -ring. These will be 64 constants for −3.2 < h < 3.2
on top of the f -intercalibration constants. At this stage the EM layers of the calorimeter
are already calibrated and the hadronic cells are equalized in f . Our aim at the h -
intercalibration is to determine a relative weight between the EM and the hadronic
calorimeter which yields the best jet energy resolution. The necessary consequence of
this procedure is well known [3], the jet response will be non-linear. This is due to the
fact that the sampling fraction decreases considerably as the shower develops, because
the calorimeter response is smaller for the soft g component in the tail of the shower than
for mips. The fraction of energy deposited in the hadronic part of the calorimeter will rise
with the energy. The shower starts later and the sampling fraction will rise in this section
for the above reasoning. Since a high sampling fraction gives less ﬂuctuations, the
hadronic part of the calorimeter demands a higher weight for the best energy resolution.
Consequently there are no single optimal constants for all energies. The default constants
have been chosen to be optimal for jet of 45 GeV which satisﬁes the vast majority of
physics program at the DØ detector.

This discussed non-linearity does not imply that only a certain jet energy is measured
correctly. With the presence of the amount of dead material in front of the calorimeter it
is anyway non-linear regardless of the weights. The non-linear calorimeter response to

jets is corrected with an energy-dependent Jet Energy Scale [4].

For the h -intercalibration we used a sample of QCD dijet events where the total
missing pT -fraction of the events was minimized by weighting the hadronic calorimeter
cells within the jets. Only well reconstructed back-to-back two jet events have been
selected and an average jet pT well above the trigger threshold was required.

Results of the h -intercalibration are plotted in Fig.4 for three different mean jet pT ’s.
As discussed, calibration constants rise with the jet pT , however there was no apprecia-
ble dependence on the jet cone size. These are constants that are on top of the older ones
which roughly reproduced the right sampling fractions. There is a discontinuity visible
in the constants which is due to the fact that there are no EM cells for 1.2 < |h | < 1.4.
The large error bars at the high |h | regions is due to a limited statistics. The correction
factor for the regions of 2.0 < |h | < 2.7 are however stable, thus we choose to extrap-
olate the mean values of this range to higher h -values rather than to use the constants
with the large errors.

After the full hadronic calorimeter calibration the jet pT -resolution were re-
determined using dijets and the same 1 fb−1 sample to account for the improvements
due to the hadronic calibration and Jet Energy Scale. The result is plotted in Fig.5 for the
h -range of 0.0 < |h | < 0.4. The dotted line is the earliest Run II result and the solid line
is with the fully calibrated 1 fb−1 data set. The hadronic calibration lead to signiﬁcant
improvements in the central region (ca. 15% improvement at the energy range of Higgs
and top decays).

Abstract

We present studies of Helium- and Argon-ﬁlled ionization chambers exposed to
intense neutron ﬂuxes from PuBe neutron sources (En = 1
10 MeV). The sources
emit about 108 neutrons per second. The number of ion pairs in the chamber gas
volume per incident neutron is derived. While limited in precision because of a large
gamma ray background from the PuBe sources, our results are consistent with the
expectation that the neutrons interact purely elastically in the chamber gas.

1 Introduction

The Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beamline at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory [1] will generate an intense νµ beam from the decays of
mesons produced in the collisions of 120 GeV protons on a graphite target. The
mesons are focused into a 675 m long evacuated volume where they decay to
µνµ produce an energetic muon for every
neutrinos. The meson decays π/K
neutrino, allowing monitoring and validation of the neutrino beam focusing
to be accomplished by monitoring of the muon ﬂux. As in several previous
experiments, the muon ﬂux and remnant hadron ﬂux at the end of the decay
volume will be measured by arrays of ionization chambers [2,3,4,5].

In addition to charged particle ﬂuxes, the ionization chambers are exposed to
large ﬂuences of neutrons, primarily produced in the aluminum/steel beam
absorber upstream of the ﬁrst muon monitor (see Figure 1). The neutron
ﬂuxes, as estimated by a GEANT[6] simulation of the beamline, are as great
107/cm2/spill in the ﬁrst
as 13
muon station. The neutron ﬂuences are a factor of 10 larger than the charged
particle levels the chambers should measure. Most of the neutrons are low
energy, with a mean energy of 30 MeV. The response of the ion chambers to
a charged particle ﬂux has been studied with electron and proton beams [7,8].
In this article, we study the response of ion chambers to neutrons.

Previous neutrino beamlines have also utilized ionization chamber arrays to
measure the muon beam proﬁle and rate. Because of background particles
produced in the beam dump, previous experiments have reported having to
contend with higher-than-anticipated ﬂuxes [9,10], or even to disregard the
rate information from the muon detectors altogether [11].

Unlike charged particles, neutrons do not ionize the gas directly. Instead, fast
neutrons interact with nuclei and create a charged recoil nucleus. This nucleus
very quickly deposits its energy through ionization. The recoil particle can be
produced either in the chamber gas or in the plates of the chamber electrodes.

We studied the response of four parallel plate ion chambers to neutron ﬂuxes
at the University of Texas Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory. The neu-
trons for this test are provided by PuBe radionuclide sources, which produce
1-10 MeV neutrons via the capture on Be of alpha particles emitted by the
Pu [12]. The total source activity is approximately 55 Ci, leading to approx-
108 neutrons/sec. The objective of this test is to determine the
imately 1.5
ionization due to neutron ﬂux, an eﬀective measurement of the cross section
for neutron scattering times the ionization left by the recoiling particles.

2 Experimental Setup

The four parallel plate ion chambers are housed in two separate Aluminum gas
vessels (see Figure 2). One vessel contains two chambers with 2 mm gas elec-
trode separation, the other has two chambers with 5 mm electrode separation.
Electrical feedthroughs to the ion chambers are made using PEEK insulating
plastic and Aluminum compression ﬁttings. A grounded Aluminum mesh in-
side the vessel separates the two chambers. The parallel plate ion chambers are
100 mm2 ceramic plates with electrodes made
fabricated from 1 mm thick 100
80 mm2
of Pt-Ag alloy, 10µm in thickness. The sense plane has a central 80
collection electrode with a 10 mm wide guard ring. The chamber materials are
identical to that to be used in the NuMI beam monitoring chambers.

×

×

One ion chamber in each vessel has a 1 µCi Am241 α source mounted such that
the α particles enter its gas volume. The alpha sources permit calibration of
temporal eﬀects such as barometric pressure variations. Each vessel also has
a signal feedthrough with no internal connection to an ion chamber. These
“dummy” feedthroughs serve to check for spurious signals.

Signals and high voltage are delivered to the setup through a shielding wall
via coaxial cable with kapton insulator. The exterior of all feedthroughs is
potted with epoxy, then wrapped in Aluminum foil to provide a complete
grounded shield. This exterior shielding reduces stray electric ﬁelds from the
high voltage feedthroughs to the signal feedthroughs which can drift ionized
charges in the surrounding air to the signal lines.

The chambers are tested under Helium or Argon gas ﬂow at 1000 mbar. The
gas used in this test is rated as 99.998% pure and is passed through an Oxygen
getter 1 before going to the chambers which are connected in series to the gas
delivery. The exhaust gas is monitored with an Oxygen analyzer 2 , showing
0.5-1.5 ppm of O2 impurity level during the tests.

The ionization current of each chamber is read by a picoammeter. 3 The nom-
inal sensitivity of the digital display of a picoammeter is 1 pA, however we
found that by using the voltage output of the current-to-voltage ampliﬁer we
could achieve a sensitivity of better than 0.1 pA for steady currents. The rea-
son for the 1 pA rating of the picoammeter appears to be drift in the internal
ampliﬁer circuit which occurred sporadically during the tests. With frequent
monitoring of the signals, we could discard data runs in which non-physical
drifts are observed. The picoammeter output is digitized by an ADC (least
signiﬁcant bit is equal to 0.06 pA) and read into a computer.

3 Neutron Source

The neutrons for this test are obtained from six individual PuBe sources. Four
of the sources are 239Pu totalling 8.99 Curies. The two others provide 46 Ci of
238Pu. The neutron yield from the 239Pu is measured to be 57 per 106 alpha
decays, but calculations suggest 65 per 106 α decays [13]. Given that yields

may vary for speciﬁc alloy samples [12], we take (60

During the test the neutron sources are moved to several locations around the
gas vessels. The neutron ﬂux through each chamber in these runs is estimated
using the source activities and the solid angle subtended by the chambers.
In performing the solid angle integral over the ion chamber faces, each PuBe
source is assumed to be point-like. The neutron ﬂux is quoted in units of pA,
106 neutrons/sec. The ﬂuxes through each chamber for each
where 1pA=6.2
run are tabulated in Table 1.

×

In Table 1 is calculated as well a cosine-weighted ﬂux. A neutron traversing the
chamber at normal incidence receives a weight 1.0, while a neutron entering
at 45◦ to the normal receives an extra weight of √2. This cosine factor weights
for the pathlength of the neutron passing through the ion chamber gas gap at
non-normal incidence, which increases its probability of interaction. The error
in the ﬂuxes due to the estimation method is about 10% for the smaller ﬂuxes
and 20% for the largest, which are very sensitive to the source positions.

The PuBe source also emits gamma rays, which form a background for the
measurements of this paper. In approximately 57% of 9Be(α, n)13C captures
which lead to an emitted neutron from the PuBe source, the 13C∗ excited
state emits a 4.4 MeV gamma [15]. These γ’s may Compton scatter in our
chamber materials, yielding additional ionization from the Compton electron.
This background is discussed further in Section 5.

4 Plateau Measurements

In each of the runs, the bias voltage for each chamber is ramped from zero
volts until gas ampliﬁcation is observed. The plateau ionization currents from
Runs 0 and 10, in which no neutron sources are present, are subtracted from
the plateau ionization currents observed in subsequent runs to determine the
neutron-induced ionization in the gas. As expected, only the chambers with an
alpha source show an appreciable signal during Runs 0 and 10. All chambers
show an additional signal when signiﬁcant neutron ﬂuxes are present.

4

Because of voltage oﬀsets in the the current-to-voltage ampliﬁer in the picoam-
meters, the deﬁnition of ’zero ionization current’ is determined by measuring
the chamber plateau curve with both positive and negative bias voltages and
assuming the plateau values to be symmetrical about zero signal. This deﬁ-
nition also calibrates away the eﬀect of any contact potentials in the cham-
bers, which cause ionization current to be collected even with zero applied
bias voltage. Figure 3, for example, shows the voltage plateau curves for the
four chambers during diﬀerent runs taken with Argon gas ﬂow. While the
2 mm chambers are fairly symmetric about zero ionization current, the 5 mm
chambers show either some eﬀect of a contact potential or an oﬀset in the
picoammeters.

Figures 3 and 4 show the plateau curves for the runs taken with Argon and
Helium gas ﬂow, respectively. In the Helium data, the negative chamber bias
data is not always available. Therefore, only the positive voltage portion of
the He runs is plotted, where the voltage plateaus have been scaled by the
ratio of positive and negative ionization currents observed in other runs. The
inavailability of the positive and negative polarities in some Helium runs leads
to somewhat larger uncertainties in the ionization currents on plateau.

To deduce the ionization current due to the PuBe source, we subtract from the
ionization current of a given run the ionization current observed in Run 0 (He
data) or Run 10 (Ar data). The chambers without alpha sources are therefore
more sensitive to small PuBe signals. The ionization current attributed to
PuBe-induced interactions is plotted as a function of neutron ﬂux in Figures 5
and 6 for the Argon and Helium data, respectively.

We have ﬁt the data in Figures 5 and 6 to ﬁnd the average PuBe source-
induced ionization per neutron. The ﬁts constrained to go through the origin
gives slope values indicated in Table 2. Allowing the vertical intercept to ﬂoat
in the ﬁt changes the slope in the Helium ﬁts, for example, by only 0.03 ion-
izations/neutron, and the ﬁtted vertical intercepts are consistent with zero
0.05 ionizations for the 5 mm and 2 mm chambers, re-
(0.04

5 Expected Rates

As stated above, some of the observed ionization per neutron in Figures 5
and 6 and in Table 2 is due to the accompanying 4.4 MeV γ’s from the PuBe
source. In this section we estimate the ionization rate induced by the PuBe
source, accounting separately for (1) the ionization from recoil gas molecules
scattered elastically by the PuBe neutrons; and (2) the ionization from Comp-
ton electrons ejected by the 4.4 MeV γ’s. “Wall eﬀects,” whereby γ rays are

5

produced by inelastic interactions of neutrons in the chamber wall materials
[17], are not considered. Similar estimates of neutron scattering in gaseous
chambers have been used to estimate rates in drift chambers downstream of
a beam dump [19]. The results of the calculations are summarized in Table 4.

5.1 Neutron Rate

The estimate of the ionization expected from neutron recoils in the gas ﬁrst
requires the measured total cross section for neutron scattering on Helium or
Argon in the energy range 2-40 MeV [18], which are repeated in Table 3. These
104 cm in the
cross sections indicate an interaction length λ = (1/nσ) of 1-2
chamber gas. The scattering is predominantly elastic below 10 MeV [12].

×

The mean energy of an elastically-scattered nucleus is ER = (2A/(1 + A)2)En,
where ER is the recoil nucleus energy, En the incident neutron energy, and A
the target nucleus mass [12]. These recoil energies, along with the estimated
ranges of these recoils in the chamber materials, are listed in Table 3. The
ranges are extrapolated from measured ranges of alpha particles [20] using the
scaling relation [21] R = Rα(m/mα)(qzα/z), where m and z are the mass
and charge of the recoiling nucleus, Rα is the range of an alpha at the same
velocity as the nuclear recoil.

The ranges of recoil Al, O, Pt, or Ag nuclei from the walls are insuﬃcient to
traverse the chamber wall materials and reach the chamber gas volume, with
the exception of Pt ions liberated very near the electrode surface. Even the Pt
ions will contribute insigniﬁcant ionization in the chamber gas, since the Pt
ions’ energies are quite low. In fact, the utility of Pt electrodes for reducing
“wall-eﬀects” in neutron interactions has been noted previously [22].

The ionization of the recoils created in the gas is then calculated. Because
of the short (1.2 mm) range of recoil Ar ions in Ar gas, we estimate their
ionization as the recoil energy divided by the energy w = 27 eV to create an
ionization in Ar gas [23], yielding an average of 8900 ionizations. For Helium
recoils, we take dE/dx = 380 keV/cm [20] for ER =1.6 MeV alpha’s, divided
by w = 32 eV to create an ion pair [24], yielding 11,900 ionizations for a
chamber with 1 cm electrode spacing.

To estimate the average ionization per neutron, we multiply the probability
for neutron scattering in the gas by the ionization deposited per recoil. The
results are given in Table 4.

6

5.2 Gamma Rate

To estimate the ionization caused by γ rays emanating from the PuBe source,
we performed a parametric Monte Carlo calculation of γ’s Compton scattering
in the chamber wall materials, followed by energy loss and multiple scattering
by the Compton-scattered electrons. The ionization induced in the chamber
gas volume is calculated for those electrons which arrive there.

Compton scattering of the 4.4 MeV γ’s occurs with approximately 1 barn
cross section [16]. This yields a probability of scattering in the Aluminum
chamber walls of 25% and a probability of scattering in the ceramic plates
of 11%. Including the fact that only 57% of neutrons are accompanied by a
4.4 MeV γ, this yields 19% of neutron events producing a Compton scatter in
the chamber walls.

After the Compton scatter, the electron energy is calculated. Its energy loss
is calculated using tabulated stopping power dE/dx data [25]. Multiple scat-
tering of the electron in the Aluminum wall and in the ceramic is estimated
as in [16]. If the path through each material (aluminum or ceramic) is greater
than the electron’s range, the electron does not reach the chamber gas vol-
ume. Approximately 74% of the Compton electrons are either ranged out in
the chamber walls or are multiple scattered away from the gas volume.

The dE/dx of the electrons arriving in the chamber gas volume is multiplied
by the path length of the electrons through the gas volume. The electron
pathlength through the gas can be larger than the electrode separation due
to their large multiple scattering. The range of the electrons is 103
104 cm
in He [25], so no electrons range out in the gas. For the He gas, we ﬁnd a
mean of 3.7 (8.8) ion pairs created in the 2 mm (5 mm) chamber. The results
after multiplying by the probability 0.18
0.26 to have a Compton electron,
are shown in Table 4.

6 Conclusions

We have studied the signals induced in ionization chambers exposed to low
energy (1-10 MeV) neutrons in the form of a PuBe source. An ionization
current from the source is observed whose magnitude is (1.1
0.1) ioniza-
tions/neutron/cm in the Helium gas, and (9.6
in the Argon gas, based on our observations at several neutron ﬂuences and
two chamber gas gaps. The ﬁrst uncertainty is that due to the estimate of the
neutron ﬂuxes, while the last uncertainty is due to the PuBe source activity
into neutrons.

Our measurements of the PuBe source-induced ionization are limited in pre-
cision because of the large number of γ rays from the PuBe sources. However,
the neutron-speciﬁc signal inferred is consistent with that expected from pure
elastic scattering of the neutrons in the chamber gas: 0.35 ion pairs per neutron
per centimeter in He, and 0.75 ion pairs per neutron per centimeter in Argon.
Because of the problem of backgrounds from the 4.4 MeV γ’s from the PuBe
source, a study of the individual pulse heights for each particle interaction in
our chambers is desirable; such will be the subject of further study.

Our measurements indicate the NuMI beam monitors will have a background
signal of order 20-30% from neutron interactions in the chambers. While the
yield of ion pairs per neutron is only 2-3% for that of charged particles (assum-
ing elastic scattering), GEANT[6]-based Monte Carlo estimates indicate that the
hadron monitor and the ﬁrst muon monitor will be exposed to the order of 10
times as many neutrons as signal particles (protons in the case of the Hadron
monitor and muons in the case of the muon monitors). The neutron back-
ground signal will be much less correllated spatially with beam misalignments
than the signal, so its eﬀect will be important to model.

Fig. 1. Location of the four ionization chamber arrays at the downstream end of
the NuMI neutrino beamline. Mesons decaying in the evacuated drift volume decay
into muons and neutrinos. Ion chamber arrays are located at four stations: upstream
of the beam absorber and embedded in the earth in three “alcoves.” These arrays
monitor the hadron and the muon components, respectively, of the beam.

Fig. 2. The apparatus used in this test. Two gas vessels, each with two parallel
plate ionization chambers, are placed approximately 20 cm apart. One vessel has
2 mm gap chambers and one has 5 mm gap chambers. The placements of the PuBe
sources near the gas vessels for the runs in Table 1 are indicated.

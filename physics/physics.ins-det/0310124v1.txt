Abstract

The ﬁrst operation of GEM gas gain elements in negative ion gas mixtures is
reported. Gains up to several thousand were obtained from single-stage GEMs
in CS2 vapor at low pressure, and in mixtures of CS2 with Argon and Helium,
some near 1 bar total pressure.

1 Introduction

Microstructured detectors such as GEMs [1, 2] and Micromegas [3, 4] are seeing
rapidly increasing application to physics experiments and applied problems[5].
These detectors oﬀer a number of advantages over other gas gain structures, in-
cluding ruggedness, mass manufacture-ability, high speed, and greatly reduced
positive ion backstreaming in TPC applications.

Negative ion drift gases (NI-gases) are another innovation in gas detector
technology which are just beginning to become known[6, 8, 7, 9]. Certain
electronegative gases allow the primary ionization in a drift or TPC device to
be transported to the gain elements in the form of negative molecular ions[10].
Mainly due to the mass matching of the drifting ions with respect to the gas
molecules, the ions are much more tightly thermally coupled to the gas than
are drifting electrons. As a result, the drift-diﬀusion, both longitudinal and
transverse, remains at the thermal (lower) limit up to extraordinarily high drift
ﬁelds, several tens of V/cm·Torr at least. This can give a dramatic advantage
in space-point resolution, particularly in long drift geometries and/or where
imposing the usual magnetic ﬁeld along the drift direction would be impractical
or undesirable. Of course, ions of mass mI will drift approximately pmI /me ∼

1

500 times slower than electrons at the same reduced ﬁeld. This is usually
a disadvantage but in low rate experiments with high channel count, it may
actually be a signiﬁcant advantage. The spatial resolution (particularly in the
drift direction) can still be quite high, even using very low-bandwidth and hence
low-noise electronics.

The present work demonstrates the compatibility of GEM gas ampliﬁcation
with negative ion drift. Furthermore it describes for the ﬁrst time some results
for GEM gain in NI-gas mixtures near 1 bar total pressure. Such mixtures will
considerably ease the construction of large NI-gas detectors by removing the
need for operation at reduced pressure in a vacuum vessel. Drift velocities and
longitudinal diﬀusion have also been measured for these NI-gas mixtures, and
will be reported on separately. However the measured drift velocities in all the
mixtures reported on here, do show pure NI-gas behavior under the conditions
of these measurements.

2 Apparatus

The apparatus used in the present work is shown schematically in Figure 1.
A single 50 mm diameter GEM manufactured by 3M Corporation[11] was
mounted 7.5 mm below a transparent (mesh) electrode, within a stainless steel
bell jar vacuum system used as a gas envelope. Drift voltages of up to -500 Volts
were applied to the mesh in the measurements reported below. The top elec-
trode of the GEM was operated at ground potential, and the bottom electrode
at variable positive voltages ranging up to 580 V. The GEM ampliﬁcation signal
was read directly from the bottom electrode through an Ortec 142PC preamp
and an Ortec 572 shaping ampliﬁer. Shaper gains from 20-200 and shaping
times from 6 to 10 µs were used. The detector was irradiated by a collimated
55Fe x-ray source a few cm above the mesh. The x-rays were directed down-
ward along the drift direction near the center of the GEM area. The source
was opened and closed remotely. Pulse height spectra were obtained using an
ORTEC ADCAM Analyst MCA.

To operate, the bell jar was closed and evacuated, backﬁlled with the de-
sired gas mixture (minor component ﬁrst), and data were taken with the sys-
tem sealed. The rate of pressure rise was less than 50 mTorr/hour at the base
pressure of 80 mTorr.
It should be noted that with negative ion gases the
inﬂuence of air contamination is minimal, since capture by oxygen is a compar-
atively weak, three body process[12], and negative molecular ions of water are
promptly stripped by drift ﬁelds of just a few tens of V/cm[13].

3 Results

The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2. Several gas mixtures
were tested, A single measurement was also made with Argon-Isobutane (a
conventional “e-gas”). These are shown in Table 1 along with the gas gain
achieved when each measurement was terminated, the logarithmic slope of the
gain vs. VGEM curve, and the last (highest) value of VGEM which was tried.
Each measurement was terminated somewhat arbitrarily at a VGEM that gave
a satisfactorily high gain. While no sparking or breakdown was observed in
the Ni-gas mixtures at any applied voltage, no attempt was made to ﬁnd the
maximum sustainable value of VGEM for the diﬀerent gases.

Pulse height spectra for two of the NI-gas mixtures are shown in Figure 3.
Note the enhanced Sulfur ﬂuorescence-escape peak in the Helium mixture due
to the low x-ray attenuation of this mixture compared to the dimensions of
the drift gap. The pulse height resolution in the argon mixture is about 35%
FWHM. Electronic noise sets in at diﬀerent levels in the two spectra mainly
because of the diﬀerent shaping ampliﬁer gain settings used.

4 Discussion

GEM’s in NI-gas mixtures show stable operation at moderately high gain. GEM
voltages up to 580 Volts were explored without any evidence of sparking or
instability.

The near 1-bar Helium mixtures are of particular interest for gas-based

(270 V) was taken for the e-gas Ar/Iso. The curves were terminated once a satisfactory
gain was achieved; no attempt was made to determine the maximum voltage the
GEM would take. No instability or sparking was observed at any voltage with any
gas mixture. The last column gives the ﬁtted logarithmic slope of the gas gain vs.

direction-sensitive Dark Matter searches. Note that the Helium component of
the 1-bar CS2-Helium mixture only increases the total electron density by 25%
over that of the CS2 component alone. Thus a detector could be constructed
with low total gas density (hence reasonably long tracks from low energy recoils,
for direction determination), but operating at or near 1 bar total pressure. This
would permit such experiments to be operated without a vacuum vessel, with
its attendant expense and radioactivity. Other advantages of such a scheme
would include the excellent spatial resolution in all three dimensions aﬀorded by
negative ion drift, greatly reduced sensitivity to electronegative contaminants,
and a signiﬁcant and variable content of medium-mass nuclei to kinematically
match the favored range of WIMP masses.

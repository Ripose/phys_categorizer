suspensions for use in interferometric gravitational-wave
detectors

Abstract

We study the thermal-noise spectrum of multi-loop pendulum suspensions for test masses in
interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. The dependence of the thermal noise on suspension
parameters and on properties of the wire material is discussed for the situation in which the losses
are dominated by the internal friction in the pendulum wires.

Introduction

The thermal noise is expected to be one of the main limitations on the sensitivity of long-baseline
interferometric gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO and VIRGO [1, 2]. Thermal ﬂuctuations of
internal modes of the interferometer’s test masses and of suspension modes will dominate the noise
spectrum at the important frequency range between 50 and 200 Hz (seismic noise and photon shot
noise dominate for lower and higher frequencies, respectively). The thermal ﬂuctuations in pendulum
suspensions were studied both theoretically and experimentally in a number of works (see, e.g. Refs. [3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]). The predictions of the thermal-noise spectrum in interferometric
gravitational-wave detectors combine theoretical models (with the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem of
statistical mechanics [16] serving as a basis) and experimental measurements of quality factors of
systems and materials involved. It is usually assumed that losses in the suspensions will occur mainly
due to the internal friction in the wires, which is related to anelasticity eﬀects [17, 18]. This assumption
will be correct only provided that all the losses due to interactions with the external world (friction
in the residual gas, dumping by eddy currents, recoil losses into the seismic isolation system, friction
in the suspension clamps, etc.) are made insigniﬁcant by careful experimental design.

In the present work we consider a multi-loop pendulum suspension and study the dependence of
the thermal-noise spectrum on properties of the wire material and on suspension parameters. The
thermal-noise spectral density x2(ω) depends strongly on the type of the internal friction in the wires.
We consider two possibilities: (i) the wire internal friction with a constant loss function and (ii) the
thermoelastic damping mechanism [19]. The main conclusion is that the thermal noise can be reduced
by increasing the number of suspension wires, especially in the case of the thermoelastic damping.
This conclusion is valid as long as the dissipation due to the friction in the suspension clamps is
insigniﬁcant.

2 Thermal-noise spectrum for a pendulum suspension

In interferometric gravitational-wave detectors, the test masses are suspended as pendulums by one
or two loops of thin wires. We will consider a multi-loop suspension with the wires attached to the
bob near the horizontal plane which cuts the bob through its center of mass. We will also assume that
the mass of the wires is much smaller than the mass of the bob. In such a multi-loop suspension the
rocking motion of the test mass is essentially suppressed and the main contribution to the thermal-
noise spectrum is due to the pendulum mode and the violin modes. Then one can write the suspension
thermal-noise spectral density as a sum,

of the pendulum-mode contribution, x2

p(ω), and of the violin-modes contribution, x2

v(ω).

According to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, the pendulum-mode contribution can be ex-

pressed as [3]

the angular frequency ω, but in fact the density is with respect to the linear frequency f = ω/2π and
x2(ω) is measured in units of m2/Hz.

3 Dependence of thermal noise on wire material and suspension

parameters

It can be seen from Eqs. (6) and (15) that the thermal noise increases with the area A of the wire
cross section. Therefore, it is desirable to use wires as thin as possible. However, the wire thickness
may not be too small since the stress σ = T /A in the wire may not exceed the breaking stress σbr. In
fact, the wires are always operated at a ﬁxed fraction of their breaking stress,

σ = σ0 = κσbr,

where κ is a numerical coeﬃcient. Typical values of κ are from 0.3 to 0.5 (it is undesirable to have larger
values of κ because then events of spontaneous stress release will contribute excess noise [20]). Thus
for a given type of the wire material, the cross-section area A should be proportional to the pendulum
mass M , according to the relation σ0 = M g/(N A). For a cylindrical wire, one has I = A2/2π. Then

where ρv = ρ/A is the volume mass density of the wire which depends only on the material used.

All the parameters in Eqs. (17) and (18) are easily measured except for the wire loss function
φw. A number of experiments were recently performed [7, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24] to study internal
losses of various wire materials (e.g., steel, tungsten, fused quartz, and some others). However, the
In
exact frequency dependence of the wire loss function φw(ω) is not yet completely understood.
many experiments φw was measured only at few frequencies and experimental uncertainty of results
was often quite large. Moreover, there are discrepancies between results of diﬀerent experiments.
Therefore, it is sometimes diﬃcult to make certain conclusions about the behavior of φw(ω).

A well known dissipation mechanism for thin samples in ﬂexure is the so-called thermoelastic
damping [19]. As a wire bends, one side contracts and heats and the other expands and cools. The
resulting thermal diﬀusion leads to the dissipation of energy. The corresponding loss function is

where ∆ is the relaxation strength and ¯τ is the relaxation time. The loss function has its maximum

For thin metallic wires (d

from few hundred Hz to few kHz. Therefore at the frequency range near 100 Hz, we are usually far

According to a recent experiment by Huang and Saulson [15], internal losses in stainless steel
wires are in good agreement with predictions of thermoelastic damping, with φw(ω) exhibiting the
characteristic frequency dependence of Eq. (19). On the other hand, the loss function for tungsten
wires was nearly constant, increasing slightly at high frequencies (above 500 Hz). φw for tungsten
wires increased with the wire cross-section area A, but the exact functional dependence of φw on A
is unclear as only three diﬀerent wire diameters were examined. In some other experiments, the loss
functions for various materials were found to be nearly constant over a wide frequency range. In a
recent experiment by Cagnoli et al. [24], internal damping of a variety of metallic wires was found to
be well modelled by the loss function of the form

φw(ω) = φ0 + φted(ω),

(23)

where φted(ω) is the thermoelastic-damping loss function of Eq. (19) and φ0 is a frequency-independent
term. Unfortunately, the dependence of φ0 on the wire diameter was not examined. It can be assumed
that the thermoelastic damping is a basic dissipation mechanism, but for some materials it is masked
by other processes. When those additional losses (whose nature is still a matter of controversy) are
small, the characteristic frequency dependence of Eq. (19) may be observed. However, when the losses
due to the thermoelastic damping are very small (which happens, for example, in the case of thin
Invar and tungsten wires), then additional losses prevail, leading to φw which is nearly constant far
from the Debye peak.

In what follows we will consider two possibilities: (i) a constant loss function φw and (ii) the loss
function of Eq. (22) which is characteristic for the thermoelastic damping at frequencies well below the
Debye peak. We might assume that for some materials the true behavior is somewhere between these
two extreme variants. For example, for tungsten wires, φw is nearly frequency-independent from 50
to 500 Hz, but still increases to some extent with the wire cross-section area A, as one should expect
from Eq. (22).

3.1 A constant loss function

For a constant φw, the dependence of the thermal-noise spectrum on various parameters is given
directly by Eqs. (17) and (18). For the pendulum-mode contribution, we ﬁnd

The allowed stress σ0 is a property of the wire material (which is also true for E, ρv, and φw), so
changing σ0 means taking wires made of diﬀerent materials. Clearly, it is desirable to have a material
with a large value of σ0, but what decides is the value of the factor Λw = E1/2φw/σ0 for the pendulum
0 for the violin modes. The factor Λw comprises all the parameters in x2
mode and Λw = ρ2
which characterize the wire material.

3.3 Comparison between diﬀerent materials

We would like to compare the thermal-noise performance of a multi-loop suspension for diﬀerent wire
materials. For example, the tungsten wires examined by Huang and Saulson [15] have rather low
breaking stress of 1671 MPa. There exist tungsten wires with higher breaking stress; for example,
Dawid and Kawamura [14] experimented with tungsten wires for which they measured σbr = 2037
MPa. It would be interesting to compare between tungsten wires with diﬀerent breaking stress but
with the same loss function. On the other hand, the comparison between wires made of tungsten and
stainless steel will clarify how the diﬀerence in the loss mechanism (frequency-independent φw versus
the thermoelastic damping) aﬀects the thermal-noise spectrum. To this end, we also would like to
consider a situation in which wires made of stainless steel have all properties as above except for the
losses being dominated by a mechanism with frequency-independent φw, instead of the thermoelastic
damping.

ﬂuctuations at the frequency range between 50 and 200 Hz. The thermal noise is reduced by using
wires with larger breaking stress, provided the other parameters remain the same.

stainless steel wires with properties listed in Sec. 3.2.) Due to this competition between two opposite
tendencies, the choice of the pendulum length is a delicate matter which depends on where in the
spectrum the seismic perturbations and the photon shot noise prevail over the thermal ﬂuctuations
and on properties of expected gravitational-wave signals.

4 Discussion

Our analysis brings to an observation that the thermal noise in pendulum suspensions can be sig-
niﬁcantly reduced by using multi-loop conﬁgurations with a large number of wires. However, before
implementing this conclusion one should consider a number of issues. First, our analysis is valid only
if the losses are dominated by the internal friction in the pendulum wires and all other sources of
dissipation are made negligible by careful experimental design. However, as was shown recently by
Huang and Saulson [15], the sliding friction in the suspension clamps is often important as well. If
this is the case, a large number of suspension loops will only sever the dissipation and thereby increase
the thermal ﬂuctuations. Therefore, if one wants to use multi-loop suspensions, a special care should
be paid to the design of clamps. Another technical problem is to make a suspension in which all the

10

loops will be equally loaded. One more issue which should be carefully studied is the eﬀect which may
have a large number of suspension wires on the internal resonances of the suspended test mass.

1 Introduction

We present a comprehensive description of a two-arm tracking system consist-
ing of eight planar drift chambers based on 5 mm diameter straws designed,
constructed, and operated in Alternating Gradient Synchrotron experiment
871 at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Following a brief motivation for the
experiment, we describe mechanical and electronics design considerations, im-
portant construction details, and three years experience in operating the sys-
tem.

1.1 Physics motivation

Despite abundant experimental conﬁrmations of the Standard Model of ele-
mentary particles and interactions, the theory is generally perceived as incom-
plete, or a low energy realization of a more general theory with a full symmetry
at higher energy. There are indeed many basic questions to which answers will
have to come from outside the current model. This is the main motivation
for theoretical and experimental explorations beyond the Standard Model. In
particular, lepton ﬂavor violation occurs naturally in many extensions of the
Standard Model; the process KL → µ±e∓ is a sensitive probe of such viola-
tion. In general, rare kaon decay experiments provided a promising avenue for
discovering phenomena outside the Standard Model.

The primary goal of experiment E871 was to search for separate lepton number
violation in the decay KL → µ±e∓. The experiment achieved a 90% C.L. limit
of 4.7 ×10−12 [1], thus probing new interactions in nature in the 200-TeV mass
scale. To achieve this sensitivity, the experiment ran with the very high beam
intensities made possible by the Booster at the AGS.

The experiment also made the ﬁrst observation of the decay KL → e+e−, mea-
suring a branching fraction of 8.7+5.7
−4.1 ×10−12 based on four observed events [2].
Over 6,000 thousand KL → µ+µ− events were also observed, for a branching
fraction of (7.19 ± 0.17) × 10−9, reducing the uncertainty for this decay mode
by a factor of three compared to previous attempts [3].

1.2 Experimental setup

Two important experimental elements relevant to this work were the AGS
high-intensity neutral beam and the E871 two-arm spectrometer. A novel
beam stop [4,5] was located in the upstream spectrometer magnet to improve
downstream acceptance, tracking, and particle identiﬁcation.

Fig. 1. BNL E871 apparatus.

The essential requirements on the spectrometer were good kinematic recon-
struction and reliable, redundant particle identiﬁcation, both to be accom-
plished in a high rate environment. The spectrometer, shown in Figure 1, was
built in the B5 beam line of the AGS. The neutral beam was produced by
an intense primary 24.1 GeV/c beam of up to 1.7×1013 protons delivered in
a 1.6 s spill onto a 1.5-interaction-length platinum target. A system of sweep-
ing magnets and collimators angled at 3.75◦ with respect to the proton beam
direction formed a neutral beam with mostly neutrons and kaons at an ap-
proximate solid angle of 4 × 16 mrad2. Particles emerging from the 11 m long
evacuated decay volume were tracked and identiﬁed in the E871 spectrometer.
The main features of the apparatus were:

• two magnets for redundant momentum measurement, tuned to form a “par-
allel trigger” for two-body KL → µ±e∓ decays (i.e., charged particles trav-
eling downstream of the second analyzing magnets triggered the apparatus
only if they traveled nearly parallel to the neutral beam direction);
• a beam-stop placed in the ﬁrst magnet to absorb the neutral beam
• redundant ﬁnely-segmented fast straw drift chambers, followed by conven-

tional drift chambers in regions of lower rate

• redundant particle identiﬁcation of muons and electrons
• multi-level trigger with fast on-line reconstruction

3

• fast custom-designed massively-parallel data acquisition system.

The neutral beam was absorbed in a beam stop specially designed and tested
for this conﬁguration. The eﬀective strengths of the magnetic ﬁelds (+418 and
−216 MeV/c) were set such that trajectories of two-body kaon decays emerged
nearly parallel to the neutral beam direction downstream of the second mag-
net [5]. Such an arrangement simpliﬁed triggering and provided the ﬁrst level
rejection of the three-body decays.

The intense primary proton beam produced roughly 2 × 108 KL decays per
AGS spill, resulting in high hit rates in the upstream straw drift chambers.
Additional rates in chambers resulted from leakage of low energy particles
(mainly charged, but also neutrons and photons) from the beam-stop. The
beam stop shielded the downstream part of the spectrometer, where rates were
substantially reduced, thus minimizing the probability of pattern-recognition
or particle-identiﬁcation errors. Rejection of background due to common kaon
decays depended crucially on precise, redundant and low-occupancy tracking.

1.3 Tracking system requirements

Since tracking resolution at low momentum is dominated by multiple Coulomb
scattering, maximal background suppression required that the tracking sys-
tem be low mass, eﬃcient, redundant, fast (i.e., possess low occupancy), and
provide good position measurement. When designing experiment 871 the fol-
lowing requirements for the tracking were thus imposed:

(1) minimize multiple Coulomb scattering by limiting the amount of material;
(2) provide tracking redundancy with low rate of wire failures and low cell

occupancy;

(3) provide high hit eﬃciency for minimum ionizing particles;
(4) sustain good position resolution in high rate environment;
(5) assure good vertex reconstruction of two-body decays.

The corollary from the above list are general hardware features desired of the
system:

• high segmentation (i.e., small cell size)
• fast drift velocity gas
• fast-timing electronics with short pulse tails
• minimal cross-talk
• mechanical robustness.

We discuss the design and material choices made to accomplish the above
requirements in the following sections.

2 Mechanical design

As Figure 1 illustrates, there were two straw stations between the decay tank
and ﬁrst spectrometer magnet, and two more between the magnets, followed
by two conventional drift chamber stations downstream of the second magnet.
An assembly drawing of a complete chamber module with x and y views is
shown in Figure 2.

2.1 Choice of materials

The technical possibility of making thin-wall tubes suggested the replacement
of traditional drift chambers — with the electric ﬁeld shaped by wires — by
chambers based on a continuous cylindrical cathode surface, or “straw”. The
name derives from the manufacturing process, which is similar to that of paper
drinking straws. Thin, small straws with wall thicknesses of approximately
30 µm and 5-mm diameter, were originally used in the vertex detectors of
several high energy physics experiments at e+e− colliders [6], as well as in
balloon ﬂight experiments [7]. They will be part of the ATLAS detector at the
CERN Large Hadron Collider [8].

Table 1 summarizes the amounts of material in an individual tracking cham-
ber, expressed in units of radiation length. The traditional 20 µm gold-plated
tungsten wire was used for the anode. As shown in the table, the total radia-
tion thickness of a typical E871 straw chamber was 0.21% of radiation length.

The thickness of conventional drift chambers was very similar.

The materials most often used for straw walls are polyester (e.g. Mylar [10])
and polyimide (such as Kapton [11]). In our experience Kapton has the better
dimensional stability of the two. Mylar straws installed for the 1995 run of
E879 showed signs of shrinkage over the course of the running period, making
the individual straws appear twisted. This motivated our move to Kapton for
rebuilt 1996 chambers; these chambers displayed no such eﬀect. We attribute
this diﬀerence in stability to the higher water content of Mylar relative to
Kapton; Mylar became more brittle or “crinkly” with age — a sign of dehy-
dration.

Two metals are typically considered for cathode lamination: aluminum and
copper. Another option is a carbon-doped substrate material with controlled
resistivity. At the time of our construction, doped Polycarbonate sheets were
available and we explored their use [12]. However, the thinnest sheets available
were 15 µm, and since Polycarbonate is mechanically weaker than Mylar, we
did not pursue this option. The use of resistive substrate and copper cathodes
was motivated by eﬀects related to the aging/oxidizing of the aluminum cath-
ode, as it had been suggested that a (semi-) conductive base material would
remedy some of these problems. Similar comments can be made about Kapton.
The thickness of Mylar and Kapton can be controlled with high precision; thin
foils can be as little as 2 µm thick. Metalizing Mylar or Kapton up to 1000 ˚A
is easy and inexpensive. Combining Mylar or Kapton with copper provided a
strong straw base and led to less severe anode aging.

6

Copper lamination was chosen because of its much better electrical aging
properties than aluminum. Copper oxide is a semiconductor, which should
lessen the possibility of cathode ﬁeld-emission eﬀects, as opposed to aluminum
dioxide, which is an insulator. Copper cathodes also have a relatively high work
function, which provides some soft-photon absorption at the straw walls.

2.2 Physical design considerations

We studied several possible planar cell patterns, trying to optimize eﬃ-
ciency and redundancy while minimizing radiation thickness and construction
complexity. The conﬁgurations fall into three categories: close-packed (Fig-
ure 3(A)), rotated close-packed (Figure 3(B)), and staggered (Figure 3(C)).
Close-pack arrangements are bonded together along the straw, forming self-
supporting structures, while staggered designs require individually tensioned
straws.

The self-supporting nature of close-pack designs oﬀers simplicity of design,
since the array needs no external tension. Staggered straws oﬀer greater ﬂex-
ibility, with a ﬂatter distribution of mean path lengths across the active area
of the chamber, but require tension to keep from sagging.

We studied the relative hit multiplicities of the various geometries via Monte
Carlo simulation for the acceptance for tracks with angle ranges with respect
to the neutral beam direction of −250 to 250, 20 to 250, and 20 to 150 mr. To
maintain high redundancy, we wanted to minimize the number of tracks for
which two or fewer hits were observed per single-view tracking station. The
simulation used the straw’s inner diameter of 0.5 cm as the size of the active
area of each straw. Simulated E871 tracks were projected onto the xz plane
and any track crossing a straw’s active area was considered a hit.

The studied geometries are shown in Figure 3 and summarized in Ta-
ble 2.2. In the ﬁrst design, a conventional 3-view close-pack, the ﬁnite
straw-wall thickness allowed some 2-hit tracks. The mean straw density was
1.97 straws/cm/view. The second design, a “rotated” close pack, allowed no
2-hit tracks, while some tracks could have as many as 6 hits. The straw den-
sity here was higher: 2.27 straws/cm/view. Both designs required straws to be
glued together for mechanical stability. The third design was a staggered-straw
geometry. This design presented a smoother gas path-length distribution and
might have allowed replacement of individual straws. Moreover the position of
the oﬀset straw could be placed oﬀ-center in order to optimize the chamber for
a desired angular acceptance. All geometries are shown for three measurement
views.

Table 2.2 compares the close-pack and rotated close-pack geometries to stag-

gered straws at the same straw density. All conﬁgurations with 2.27 straws/cm/view
appear to be hit-equivalent. The view densities used here should be consid-
ered the two extremes. Only a skewed-stagger design, which provides plenty
of straw-to-straw separation while still limiting the 2-hit probability and view
density, allows a continuous density adjustment.

In summary, we found that the rotated close-pack and staggered designs with
2.27 straws/cm/view had similar hit characteristics. The mean numbers of hits
were 3.45 and 3.46 respectively and neither had appreciable 2-hit probability.
Due to the unavoidable dead space between adjacent straws, the conventional
close-pack design allowed about 3% 2-hit tracks.

The tensioning required of staggered conﬁgurations would make chambers
susceptible to “creep”, or relaxation of tension, which is expected from any
plastic stretched beyond its glass transition point. In laboratory testing we
observed this eﬀect in our Mylar straws. While tensioning or gluing of the
x (vertical-straw) view would have been unnecessary; y views, with horizon-
tal straws, required either tension or structural support to maintain shape.
Prototype chambers of both close pack and individually-tensioned, staggered
straws were built and tested in cosmic-ray telescopes and in the AGS neutral
beam, but the technical challenges associated with the individually-tensioned
conﬁguration led us to choose the conventional close pack design for the E871
spectrometer.

dancy in the momentum-measuring horizontal (xz) plane, the x-measuring
views each had a redundant, third plane of drift cells. Each drift cell in the
straw drift chambers consisted of a 5-mm diameter cylindrical copper-plated
Mylar or Kapton cathode [13,14] with a 20-micron gold-plated tungsten sense
wire [15] along its axis. The cylindrical cathodes were wound on precision man-
drels, where they were built up from two 25.4-µm layers of material bonded
with a thin layer of 4-8 µm of adhesive. The inner layer had the 0.1-µm cop-
per layer vapor-deposited [16] on one side which faced the inside of the straw
tube. The original straws in the experiment were made of Mylar. However, all
but one of the chambers (called SDC4LY) were rebuilt with Kapton for the
1996 run period. Cylindrical brass sleeves provided the mechanical support
and electrical contact between the straws and the end-plates. Feedthroughs
pass through the end-plates and into the sleeves.

Individual straws were bonded into closely-packed arrays whose cross section
is shown in Figure 4. Sense wires were precisely positioned within the straws
by molded Ultem [17] inserts, which also acted as gas feedthroughs. Ground
contact between the copper cathodes and the aluminum chamber frames was
made through gold-plated brass sleeves, which were press-ﬁt onto the Ultem
feedthroughs and silver-epoxied into the straws. More silver epoxy formed
the electrical contact between the sleeves and the chamber frames, while also
providing a gas seal. Figures 5,6,7 show a cross-section assembly drawing of
the inserts, sleeves, and end-plate gas manifold. A more detailed end-plate
assembly for one of the chambers, including ampliﬁer-card mounting and gas
connections, is shown in Figure 8. The straw drift chamber characteristics are
summarized in Table 3.

The feedthrough assembly served a number of functions, including positioning,
tensioning, and electrically isolating the anode wire from the end-plate. It also
supported the electrical contact of the anode wire to the outside signal and
high voltage, and provided gas ﬂow into or out of the straw. A sketch of the
end-plate and feedthrough assembly is shown in Figure 5.

The wire was positioned at the center of the straw at the feedthrough with a
precision of about 25 µm using a V-shaped groove molded into the feedthrough
near one end (Figure 7). Tension was maintained with a brass pin inserted and
clamped into the slotted Ultem end opposite the V-groove. The pin diameter,
about 50 µm smaller than the inside diameter of the feedthrough, allowed the
anode wire to extend along the pin. The wire was compressed between the
brass pin and the (slotted) feedthrough wall with an Ultem ring, which slid
over the outside of the feedthrough.The pin end of the feedthrough, the pin,
and the compression ring extended outside the chamber end-plate.

The Ultem material had a resistance of at least 100 MΩ through its wall thick-
ness of 0.10 inches. Gas was supplied to the straw tubes in parallel through a
gas manifold milled into the end-plates. From the manifold, the gas entered
the interior of the Ultem feedthrough via a pair of holes in the feedthrough
walls.

Since the straw assembly was essentially irreversible, we did a test assembly
of the complete chamber frame, including end-plates and corner blocks. This
was then dismantled for installation of straws. All straw-end pieces were de-
burred and cleaned in an ultrasonic bath. Prior to assembly, holes with critical
clearance, such as the Ultem clearance holes in the end-plates, were tested and
cleaned by inserting the requisite gauge pin. Most gas ﬁttings were installed in
the frame pieces prior to assembly, since the assembled frame had insuﬃcient
clearance for installation. With the exception of the ﬁrst chamber built (called
SDC2R), which had a stainless steel frame, all frame pieces were aluminum.

The straws, of Mylar or Kapton, were shipped with Tyvek [18] liners, in ei-
ther PVC tubes or wooden crates. Thus the ﬁrst step in the straw preparation
was unpacking, de-lining, and inspection. Straws with visible inner surface
irregularities (dents or lumps of glue) were rejected. Following a previous ex-
periment [19], we constructed a simple straw cutting method consisting of a
precision bored Al block, with a hole diameter about 25 µm larger than the
outer diameter of straws, with a transverse slit cut through the bore. Cutting
a straw only required insertion into the bore and sliding a razor into the slit.

Straws were installed in each x and y view of each module separately. Be-
fore the two views were combined, their straws were laminated, potted, and
structurally glued to the view sub-frame. Straws were held together within
an array through spot application of Epo-Tek 301-2, a very liquid epoxy with
an 8-hour pot life and two day cure [23]. After securing the straws precisely

12

in place with specially-made brackets mounted on the chamber frames, epoxy
was applied in small (∼ 0.5 mm-diameter) drops to 4–6 points along each tan-
gent between straws. A gas-pressure dispenser was used, with tubular steel
tips which allowed inner straws to be reached.

At this point the two views ﬁt loosely in their frames. Bolting and pinning the
x and y views together completed and squared the module frame, making it
possible to bond the straw arrays to the frames by applying Tra-Bond 2143D
epoxy [24] around each insert outside the chamber end-plates, but still inside
the gas manifold. Electrical contact between the straw inner surface (via the
gold-plated brass ‘sleeve’) was made by ﬁlling the gap between straw/sleeve
end and inner end-plate surface with EPO-TEK 410E silver-ﬁlled epoxy [23].
Although before installation individual straw assemblies were tested for leaks,
the silver epoxy should form an additional gas seal; the 2143D epoxy forms
the manifold-straw seal. The frame assembly was completed by gluing down
of the manifold cover with a bead of silver epoxy joining the aluminum cover
to the end-plate and ﬁlling the 2143D epoxy around each ultem insert.

Wires were installed after chamber assembly. We used 20-µm, gold-plated
tungsten wire. The wire was threaded through a blunted sewing needle, fed
through the top insert, and lowered down the straw and out the bottom insert.
To provide working clearance and hold the wire against the interior v-notch
of the insert, the wire was deﬂected by a horizontal bar suspended below
the chamber. A gold-plated brass pin was inserted into the top insert and
clamped in place with an Ultem collar. Then tension was applied to the wire
by clamping a 70-g mass below the bottom insert and deﬂecting bar (some
tension was lost to friction at the bar and at the Ultem notch). Wire tension
was locked in by installing another brass pin in the bottom insert, again with
a clamping Ultem collar. Because of the awkward position and close-pack
clearances of this step, we designed a special tool for pin installation. Once we
were satisﬁed with the wire installation, a drop of epoxy (301-2) at each end
ensured the pins and wire ends stayed in place.

We checked wire tensions by measuring the resonant frequency of a driven wire
in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. A custom device [28] performed the frequency
measurement and provided the driving frequency, while a permanent magnet
held near the wire center supplied the ﬁeld. Any wires not satisfying minimum
tension or standoﬀ limits were removed and replaced.

3 Readout electronics

Signals from the straw sense wires were ampliﬁed and discriminated on 6-
channel boards directly mounted on the straw end pins. The ampliﬁer circuit

13

Fig. 8. SDC chamber assembly.

(Figure 9) is a four-transistor design, decoupled from the high-power discrimi-
nation stage by a 1-to-2 transformer [29]. The gain was about 20 mV/µA with
less than 1.5% cross talk, and a typical operating threshold of 1.5 µA. The
digitized signal was converted to a 30-ns pulse and sent over a 333-ft long,
500-ns delay line by a 96-channel driver board, to be recorded by a 6-bit,
1.75-ns least-count TDC.

Since particle positions were determined from the drift times of ionization
electrons, position resolution was directly aﬀected by the precision of the drift-
time measurement. The high particle ﬂux expected in experiment 871 required
a small cell size to minimize occupancy, with a high drift velocity gas for
reduced dead time.

The small cell size of the straw chambers called for tight packing of front-end
channels, increasing the possibility of cross talk. Our plan to use a CF4 drift
gas, meanwhile, implied small pulse heights, requiring a high gain front-end
ampliﬁer. In addition, the front-end electronics were required to dovetail with
existing equipment: 32-channel gray code TDCs with 1.875 ns least count [33]
coupled to the front-end electronics through 97-conductor (32 ECL channel)
500 ns delay lines. Front-end components designed and built speciﬁcally for
E871 included 6-channel ampliﬁer/discriminator boards, which mounted di-
rectly onto the chamber frames, and 96-channel cable driver boards. A block

diagram of the straw chamber electronics setup is shown in Figure 10.

Initial designs of the front end ampliﬁer based on an integrated-circuit am-
pliﬁer proved costly (more than 12 dollars per channel), while an ASIC-based
design missed our time window. We therefore pursued a much less expensive
option (less than ﬁve dollars per channel), based on a four-transistor discrete
ampliﬁer design. Our initial design, with high-voltage distribution and the
analog ampliﬁer circuit on the chamber-mounted board and the discriminator
on a separate driver board, taught us that twist-n-ﬂat cable made an excellent

15

antenna. The discriminator stage was subsequently moved onto the chamber-
mounted board.

The ﬁnal 6-channel ampliﬁer/discriminator layout consisted of high-voltage,
analog, and digital sections coexisting on one four-layer board. Copious
grounding and surface-mounted components eased the tight space constraints,
while SIP sockets facilitated mounting the cards directly onto the straw end
pins. The bias high voltage and front-end ampliﬁer low-voltage power, along
with odd- and even-channel pulser signals for rudimentary electronics diagno-
sis, were delivered by chamber-mounted busses. The digital half of the ampli-
ﬁer boards were supplied by a separate cable bus.

3.1 Early testing

Early bench tests with simulated straw pulses reported gains of (22. ±
1.2) mV/µA. Stable operation was achieved at thresholds as low as 0.9 µA. We
found that DIP-package multi-channel transformers in our original ampliﬁer
design caused too much cross talk. After replacing these with single-channel
packages, cross talk between adjacent channels was reduced to 1.5%.

The front-end ampliﬁers were also tested on prototype straw chambers. During
cosmic ray tests the ampliﬁers again operated at thresholds below 1 µA, with
overall straw eﬃciencies measured above 97%. Single-wire position resolution
for the cosmic ray tests was 120 µm for the Ar-ethane (50-50) gas-ﬁll.

3.2 Full-system performance

During actual data taking for E871, the complete 6500-channel straw cham-
ber readout system performed nearly as well as in tests. Even in the noisy
environment of a high energy physics experiment, all chambers operated at or
below a 1.3-µA threshold with a mean eﬃciency of 96%.

We experienced a signiﬁcant board failure rate due to cold solder joints on the
ampliﬁer cards; a test stand was built to diagnose and repair these faults.

The entire mechanical design and the front-end electronics system has sub-
sequently been copied for use in the Fermilab FOCUS experiment (FNAL
831) [27].

4 Gas system

The gas delivery system was built to handle multiple gas mixtures, applying
both high- and low-pressure ﬁltering. Its purpose was to provide an uninter-
rupted ﬂow of clean gas mixture, with a constant ratio of its components while
maintaining stable pressure inside and outside the straw volume. Additional
attention was paid to purifying the gases, since impurities in the gas mixture
can catalyze straw etching or aﬀect the attachment coeﬃcient, charge-carrier
diﬀusion, or drift velocity.

In order to minimize multiple scattering eﬀects, we ﬂowed helium through
the chamber volumes surrounding the straw tubes, while helium-ﬁlled bags
occupied the spaces between chambers. The gas system had to regulate the
helium ﬂow so that diﬀerential pressure across walls was restrained and ﬂow
was suﬃcient to prevent accumulation of ﬂammable gas in the helium-ﬁlled
volumes.

During normal operation the detectors and a large part of the gas system
were in a high radiation environment. It was critical to have remote access to
the status of the gas system. Supply pressures, mixture ﬂow rates and ratios,
input and output pressures, and diﬀerential pressure across the straw walls
were continuously monitored and periodically inserted into the data stream.

4.1 Choice of gas

The high beam intensity in E871 necessitated not only increased segmentation
of the upstream chambers, but also the use of a gas with a higher drift velocity,
thus reducing the overall occupancy.

Most fast drift mixtures considered by various straw/chamber groups have
been based on tetraﬂuoromethane [35], CF4 (also known as Halocarbon 14).
Our decision to use CF4-C2H6 (50:50) was based primarily on studies per-
formed by Heinson and Rowe [30]. They list several advantages of an ethane
mixture over the commonly-used CF4-iC4H10 (80:20), including a 10% higher
drift velocity, safer handling, smaller radiation length, insensitivity to soft pho-
tons — they report the ethane mixture to be 25% less sensitive than isobutane.
Perhaps most notably, they also found the CF4-C2H6 mixture to be less expen-
sive and to permit a 200-V lower operating voltage. Plateau curves observed
in the laboratory with a prototype chamber for this gas are shown in Figure 11
for two diﬀerent radioactive sources. We chose a nominal operating voltage of
1975 V. Figure 12 compares the response of this gas to some other potential
mixtures.

ceeding 100 µm/nsec, twice that of Ar-C2H6 50:50. This factor combined with
the improved segmentation ratio reduced the individual drift cell occupancy by
a factor of eight over the conventional wire chambers of E791, the predecessor
to E871.

4.2 Experience with prototypes

Prototype chambers were built at The University of Texas and Stanford and
tested both in cosmic-ray telescopes and in the AGS neutral beam. It was
during these tests that aging eﬀects due to gas contamination began to appear.

4.2.1 Sulphur contamination

After discovering a blackening eﬀect in straws subjected to ethane ﬂow dur-
ing the 1994 engineering run, we analyzed the interior surfaces of some of the
exposed straws with Auger Electron Spectroscopy and a Scanning Tunneling
Microscope. We found evidence of sulfating of copper due to sulfur contami-
nants in our ethane supply, and concluded that it was necessary to develop a
gas ﬁltration system for our copperized straw system.

Compounds such as H2S and SO2 are very reactive with copper, forming a
black copper sulfate which in time replaces the copper, destroying the electrical
conductivity of the straw and eﬀectively removing the cathode. To solve this
contamination problem, we speciﬁed a sulfur content of 0 ppm for our ethane
supply, a severe restriction. In addition, we installed high-pressure catalyst and
sieve ﬁlters directly on the ethane gas bottles, prior to pressure regulation.

4.2.2 Eﬀects due to CF4

Impurities in our freon supply were also found to cause straw aging. With
a small Mylar-straw test stand, we observed that with very low ﬂow rates
of freon-based gases the conductive copper surface may be removed entirely
(‘etched’) from the Mylar surface.

We observed an etching eﬀect in a controlled experiment using a small test
chamber consisting of two identical, 60-cm copperized Mylar straws. After
bringing the straws to an operating voltage of 2.3 KV with CF4-methane
(30:70), we halted the gas ﬂow and left the bias on one of the straws. This
straw began to draw current after about 1.5 hours, and at 2 hours was drawing
5 µA. Meanwhile the copper was disappearing from this straw, leaving clear
Mylar. A similar test with Ar-ethane (50:50) showed no eﬀect. To isolate the
problem gas, the test was repeated with 100% CF4; the straw drew 60 µA
within 5 minutes after ﬂow was stopped, eventually leveling oﬀ at 140 µA.
After about 8 hours the copper in this straw was visibly thinner.

We have found no reports of any other observations of this eﬀect. The most
consistent mechanism is this: water vapor entered the tubes at a constant rate
and with the gas ﬂowing at some minimum value, it was ﬂushed out. When
the gas ﬂow was stopped the water concentration in the straws built up. The
hydrogen in the water reacted with some CF4 radicals to make hydroﬂuoric
acid which attacked the copper. As a result of this study we increased our gas
ﬂow from three volume exchanges per day to ten.

4.3 Gas puriﬁcation

The gases used were standard commercial products,
including CP-grade
ethane (99.0% pure) and semiconductor-grade CF4 (99.7% pure). Table 5 lists
impurities found in the CF4 as supplied. As has already been observed, some of
these contaminants can play a role in the acceleration of aging eﬀects. Water,
oxygen, and any halocarbons were the most undesirable impurities.

A low pressure ﬁltration system was placed after blending the gas mixture
components. Its goal was to eliminate sulfur, water, and oxygen from the gas

21

mixture.

Ethane, derived from natural gas, can contain many parts per million (ppm)
of H2S, depending on its source. While mass-spectrographic analysis indicated
that the H2S level in our ethane supply was not very high, even contamination
at a few ppm could destroy our thin (1000 ˚A) copper cathode. We therefore
developed a ‘scrubbing’ system to remove the inevitable sulfur contamination.

We required a simple, safe, inexpensive, self-indicating system, which ruled
out many of the processes common to the petrochemical industry. However the
catalyst PURASPEC 4037, a material produced by ICI Catalysts of Billing-
ham, England [31] allows for low-pressure, low-temperature elimination of H2S
from the gas stream. The catalyst is in the form of 0.1-0.2 in diameter spheres
composed of 40-45% copper oxide and 20-30% zinc oxide by weight, with the
balance being aluminum oxide. These metal oxides react with H2S to produce
metal sulﬁdes and water vapor. The water vapor must then be removed by a
second trap, which consisted of silica or alumina gel.

The scrubbing system thus took shape as two 8-in long, 1.5-in diameter glass
cylinders, one ﬁlled with PURASPEC 4037 and a second with silica gel. The
cylinders were tapered at each end to allow connection to the rest of the
gas system, while the absorbent materials were contained within the cylinders
between plugs of glass wool. Glass cylinders were used to take advantage of the
self indicating feature of the absorbents, since PURASPEC 4037 turns from
gray/green to black when loaded with sulfur, while alumina gel turns from
blue to pink when saturated with water. We included a redundant scrubbing
line to prevent disruption during absorber replacement. Heavy-walled glass
was used throughout. To prevent overpressure, we installed a check valve with
a crack pressure of 20 psi before the scrubber system. An oxygen trap [32]
completed the scrubber system.

Immediately upstream and downstream of the scrubber system, we installed
reaction monitors, consisting of clear plexiglas tubes containing copper straws.
They were used as indicators of chemical reactions uncorrelated to the radia-
tion environment of the chambers. Figure 14 depicts the complete low-pressure
scrubber system.

In addition to the low-pressure scrubber system, we installed a high pressure
ﬁltration system directly on the ethane bottles to remove oil, water, and pos-
sible large debris upstream of the high-pressure regulators. The system was
composed of a pair of mechanical ﬁlters eﬀective at eliminating contaminants
greater than 10-15 and 2-5 microns respectively, available from many sources
in varying form [36]. The ﬁnal stage of the high pressure ﬁltration system was
a type 13X molecular sieve [37], a crystaline metal aluminosilicate. This type
of sieve material is composed of Na2O, Al2O3, and SiO2. It is capable of re-

structure, with the OH radical replaced by an SH radical). The nominal pore
diameter is 10 ˚A, and expected levels of H2S after this high pressure system
were below 0.1 ppm.

4.4 Flow control

Drift gas mixtures and ﬂow rates were controlled by a Matheson Multichannel
Dyna-Blender [38]. Each channel was a mass ﬂow controller that delivered the
appropriate ﬂow near atmospheric pressure, regardless of the input pressure.
The blender maintained gas mixture ratios to 2% precision at operational
ﬂow rates, and adjusted as necessary for ﬂuctuations in input pressure. It
simultaneously provided online ﬂow readings, so it also served as an indicator
of gas-supply shortages.

Total helium ﬂow to the volumes surrounding the straws was controlled by
a dependent channel of the blender. This channel was maintained at some
fraction of the ﬂow rate of the total internal straw ﬂow, thus limiting the
diﬀerential pressure experienced by the straws.

The blender regulated the total ﬂow of the gas mixture and the helium. Dis-
tribution of the gas to the 8 detectors (14 modules) was accomplished by a
parallel set of rotameters. Vent bubblers were used to prevent contamination of
the gas volume from back ﬂow and maintained a minimum pressure inside the
chamber. Diﬀerential pressure sensors [39] monitored the diﬀerence in pressure
between the drift gas and surrounding helium volume at each chamber.

23

4.5 Helium volumes

To minimize multiple scattering, polyurethane bags ﬁlled with helium sur-
rounded the whole detector, ﬁlling the spectrometer ﬁducial volume. Helium
also ﬁlled the volumes made up by chamber frames, outside the straws. The
gas system was tuned to maintain a positive outward pressure gradient on
the straw tube walls. Higher pressure was needed on the inner surface since
the straw tubes were very sensitive to outside forces that were not compen-
sated from the inside. Lab tests had shown that straws could withstand at
least 20 psig of inner pressure without any damage. On the other hand, the
smallest pressure on the outside surface deformed them. If this deformation
was more than 1-2 cm long, the cathode did not return to its original shape;
the resulting defect could thus distort the straw electric ﬁeld. Helium was
ﬂowed through the volumes rather than statically ﬁlling them, to prevent the
potential accumulation of ﬂammable gasses.

As a ﬁnal precaution, a set of diﬀerential pressure sensors were installed. They
continuously measured the diﬀerential pressure between the inside and the
outside of the straws. A pressure threshold of 2.54 cm of water was used to
generate an alarm. Readings of the diﬀerential pressures were displayed online
in the control room.

The helium supplied to the helium bags surrounding the chambers was inde-
pendent from the helium supply inside. A system of photohelic gauges moni-
tored the diﬀerential pressure of the inside and the outside of the bags. Their
mission was to automatically switch on and oﬀ actuator valves so that the
bags were always full. If the pressure had exceeded a prespeciﬁed pressure
level, then the bag would start pushing the thin Mylar windows enclosing
the chambers’ helium volume. The bags would have eﬀectively applied an in-
creased pressure on the outside of the straw tubes. Relief valves (bubblers)
were placed at the output of the helium bags to protect the chambers in case
of failure of the photohelic system.

4.6 Operating conditions

Keeping down the cost of our CF4 supply meant restricting the ﬂow of our gas
mixture to the lowest safe value. Due to its small molecular size, helium could
invade the straw volume through the straw walls, aﬀecting mixture purity. In
addition, electron impact dissociation in the gas produces F− and CF−
3 nega-
2 and CF∗
tive ions together with F∗, CF∗
3 radicals. Too little ﬂow would have
allowed these radicals enough time to become involved in polymerization and
further chemical reactions, including etching. The copper layer is extremely

During the ﬁrst running period of the experiment, the ﬂow was set to 3-5
volume exchanges per day. Lab tests had shown no problems with this ﬂow
rate. However, these had been performed outside of the intense radiation en-
vironment of the E871 spectrometer, and not for such long periods. As has
been discussed, we eventually discovered signs of etching in the most heavily
radiated straws. For the 1995 run period the ﬂow was increased to 8-10 volume

modules used in the 5-month 1996 run period, we observed no etching eﬀects
with this higher ﬂow rate.

Gas volumes and ﬂow exchanges are listed in Tables 6 and 7.

4.7 Running experience

The gas system operated successfully, providing the necessary purity of gases
while maintaining a constant ﬂow and mixture ratio. No sulfur contamination
was detected and no aging eﬀects were observed in the performance of the
detector. No further evidence of aging was observed after the ﬂow rate increase
and installation of the scrubbing systems.

During the 12 months of operation the PURASPEC 4037 material had slightly
changed color, indicative of sulfur trapping, while the silica gel was twice over-
loaded with water. The NANOCHEM oxygen cartridge was very sensitive, eas-
ily overloaded with oxygen in open air contact, and without self-indication. We
replaced it on a regular schedule (after every second cylinder of CF4 used), but
the system was always vulnerable to contamination from insuﬃcient purging
upstream or from any leakage downstream.

The diﬀerential pressure sensors proved to be extremely useful. With gas lines
of tens of meters lengths and numerous connections, valves and distribution
manifolds, it was easy to limit by accident either the input or the output
ﬂow of the gas mixture. At least twice they provided critical alarms of higher
pressure on the outside helium volume. The pressure was sensed through long

26

lines since the actual sensors were located far away from the detectors (outside
the high radiation area). This caused a delay in measuring the actual pressure
gradient.

The use of manifolds with multiple stations, double ﬁltering systems and purg-
ing capabilities, allowed the continuous and uninterrupted ﬂow of gas for long
periods (6 months). The pressure and ﬂow sensors provided warnings for each
irregularity in the normal operation and reminders for the necessary mainte-
nance of the system. The precision of each gas component ﬂow was ±10 ccm,
resulting in a 5% uncertainty in the mixture ratio at the operational ﬂow. The
distribution of ﬂow to individual modules was done with ﬂowmeters with ﬂow
adjusting valves. These provided only a rough measurement of the portion of
the total ﬂow directed to each module. They were unreliable and two of them
had to be replaced because of malfunction. Also, the Matheson high pressure
sensors had a high rate of failure; two stopped working after months of normal
operation.

5 Performance

5.1 Chamber calibration

5.1.1 Alignment

The straw chambers were installed in the E871 spectrometer on tables of alu-
minum jig plate, which had been surveyed relative to the beam axis and target.
The chambers were pinned and bolted to the tables before they themselves
were surveyed. Much more accurate relative positions information could be
obtained using track data recorded with the spectrometer magnets oﬀ. Cor-
rections to the optical survey results were derived from this straight-through
data.

Relative transverse corrections to chamber positions within a view (x or y,
left or right) can be readily extracted from straight-through tracks, but lon-
gitudinal (beam parallel) and global corrections require more work. The rel-
ative positions of the left and right arms of the spectrometer were extracted
from reconstructed vertex distributions, while longitudinal corrections within
spectrometer arms were derived from magnet-on data, where allowances for
multiple scattering in the track ﬁtting algorithm had been disabled in software.

Alignment was performed iteratively. The tracking χ2, measured with an inde-
pendent ﬁtting algorithm, reduced systematic errors from the combined eﬀect
of the magnetic ﬁeld map and the spectrometer survey to below 1%.

5.1.2 Timing and drift velocity

For every change in straw and drift chamber operating conditions, we gen-
erated new calibrations for TDC time oﬀsets, single-wire eﬃciencies, and ef-
fective time-to-distance relations. More than sixty calibration updates were
needed for the two years’ run periods.

Normal minimum-bias data and random-trigger data were used to perform the
calibrations, which were done in an iterative fashion. Noise rates determined
hot or dead wires, while time sum residuals between neighboring wire pairs
were minimized to determine the TDC time oﬀsets.

5.2 Straw system performance

As shown in Figure 17, noise rates for individual wires in the straw chambers
approached 750 kHz at 15×1012 protons (Tp) on target for wires near the
beam and in front of the beam stop. The continuous cathodes and stability of
the straws allowed smaller cell size for decreased occupancy, while minimizing
crosstalk. A typical residual distribution is shown in Figure 18. The mass
resolution of the spectrometer as a whole is shown in Figure 19, which shows

Straw eﬃciency was ﬂat across most of the cell area, dropping oﬀ near the
straw wall, where particles traversed increasingly smaller gas path lengths.

since, as evident from Figure 17, the upstream chamber intensity varies across
the chamber face. Figure 21 displays the single-channel eﬃciencies for all straw
and conventional drift chambers. The mean eﬃciencies for straws and drift
chambers were 96% and 98%, respectively.

6 Summary

We successfully developed, built, and operated a set of straw tracking cham-
bers with over 6500 channels for the BNL E871 rare decay search. The system
proved to be robust, with no rate-induced tripping or ineﬃciency at rates
over 700 KHz. The system utilized a close-pack cell conﬁguration of Mylar or
Kapton 0.5-cm diameter, copper-lined straws with a 50:50 CF4-C2H6 drift gas
at atmospheric pressure. We developed custom front-end ampliﬁers and elec-
tronics for the chambers, and operated them for two years’ running periods
at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

In this paper, we report high-precision absolute distance and vibration measurements performed with frequency
scanned interferometry using a pair of single-mode optical ﬁbers. Absolute distance was determined by counting
the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency. A high-ﬁnesse Fabry-Perot interferometer was
used to determine frequency changes during scanning. Two multiple-distance-measurement analysis techniques were
developed to improve distance precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations. Under laboratory
conditions, measurement precision of ∼ 50 nm was achieved for absolute distances ranging from 0.1 meters to 0.7
meters by using the ﬁrst multiple-distance-measurement technique. The second analysis technique has the capability
to measure vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz with amplitude as small as a few nanometers, without
a priori knowledge. A possible optical alignment system for a silicon tracker is also presented.

1. Introduction

The motivation for this project is to design a novel optical system for quasi-real time alignment of tracker detector
elements used in High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. A.F. Fox-Murphy et.al. from Oxford University reported
their design of a frequency scanned interferometer (FSI) for precise alignment of the ATLAS Inner Detector [1, 2].
Given the demonstrated need for improvements in detector performance, we plan to design an enhanced FSI system
to be used for the alignment of tracker elements in the next generation of electron positron Linear Collider detectors.
Current plans for future detectors require a spatial resolution for signals from a tracker detector, such as a silicon
microstrip or silicon drift detector, to be approximately 7-10 µm[3]. To achieve this required spatial resolution, the
measurement precision of absolute distance changes of tracker elements in one dimension should be on the order of
1 µm. Simultaneous measurements from hundreds of interferometers will be used to determine the 3-dimensional
positions of the tracker elements.

The University of Michigan group constructed two demonstration Frequency Scanned Interferometer (FSI) systems
with laser beams transported by air or single-mode optical ﬁber in the laboratory for initial feasibility studies. Abso-
lute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency[4]. The
main goal of the demonstration systems was to determine the potential accuracy of absolute distance measurements
that could be achieved under controlled conditions. Secondary goals included estimating the eﬀects of vibrations and
studying error sources crucial to the absolute distance accuracy. The main contents of this proceedings article come
from our published paper[5]. However, new material in this paper includes a description of a dual-laser system and
a possible optical alignment for a silicon tracker detector.

2. Principles

The intensity I of any two-beam interferometer can be expressed as

I = I1 + I2 + 2√I1I2 cos(φ1

φ2)

−

(1)

where I1 and I2 are the intensities of the two combined beams, and φ1 and φ2 are the phases. Assuming the optical
path lengths of the two beams are L1 and L2, the phase diﬀerence in Eq. (1) is Φ = φ1
(ν/c),

where ν is the optical frequency of the laser beam, and c is the speed of light.

For a ﬁxed path interferometer, as the frequency of the laser is continuously scanned, the optical beams will

constructively and destructively interfere, causing “fringes”. The number of fringes ∆N is

where L is the optical path diﬀerence between the two beams, and ∆ν is the scanned frequency range. The optical
path diﬀerence (OPD for absolute distance between beamsplitter and retroreﬂector) can be determined by counting
interference fringes while scanning the laser frequency.

3. Demonstration System of FSI

A schematic of the FSI system with a pair of optical ﬁbers is shown in Fig.1. The light source is a New Focus
Velocity 6308 tunable laser (665.1 nm < λ < 675.2 nm). A high-ﬁnesse (> 200) Thorlabs SA200 F-P is used to
measure the frequency range scanned by the laser. The free spectral range (FSR) of two adjacent F-P peaks is 1.5
GHz, which corresponds to 0.002 nm. A Faraday Isolator was used to reject light reﬂected back into the lasing
cavity. The laser beam was coupled into a single-mode optical ﬁber with a ﬁber coupler. Data acquisition is based
on a National Instruments DAQ card capable of simultaneously sampling 4 channels at a rate of 5 MS/s/ch with a
precision of 12-bits. Omega thermistors with a tolerance of 0.02 K and a precision of 0.01 mK are used to monitor
temperature. The apparatus is supported on a damped Newport optical table.

In order to reduce air ﬂow and temperature ﬂuctuations, a transparent plastic box was constructed on top of the
optical table. PVC pipes were installed to shield the volume of air surrounding the laser beam. Inside the PVC
pipes, the typical standard deviation of 20 temperature measurements was about 0.5 mK. Temperature ﬂuctuations
were suppressed by a factor of approximately 100 by employing the plastic box and PVC pipes.

Detectors for HEP experiments must usually be operated remotely for safety reasons because of intensive radiation,
In addition, precise tracking elements are typically surrounded by other
high voltage or strong magnetic ﬁelds.
detector components, making access diﬃcult. For practical HEP application of FSI, optical ﬁbers for light delivery
and return are therefore necessary.

The beam intensity coupled into the return optical ﬁber is very weak, requiring ultra-sensitive photodetectors for
detection. Considering the limited laser beam intensity and the need to split into many beams to serve a set of
interferometers, it is vital to increase the geometrical eﬃciency. To this end, a collimator is built by placing an
optical ﬁber in a ferrule (1mm diameter) and gluing one end of the optical ﬁber to a GRIN lens. The GRIN lens is a
0.25 pitch lens with 0.46 numerical aperture, 1 mm diameter and 2.58 mm length which is optimized for a wavelength
of 630nm. The density of the outgoing beam from the optical ﬁber is increased by a factor of approximately 1000
by using a GRIN lens. The return beams are received by another optical ﬁber and ampliﬁed by a Si femtowatt
photoreceiver with a gain of 2

1010V /A.

4. Multiple-Distance-Measurement Techniques

For a FSI system, drifts and vibrations occurring along the optical path during the scan will be magniﬁed by a
factor of Ω = ν/∆ν, where ν is the average optical frequency of the laser beam and ∆ν is the scanned frequency
range. For the full scan of our laser, Ω
67. Small vibrations and drift errors that have negligible eﬀects for many
optical applications may have a signiﬁcant impact on a FSI system. A single-frequency vibration may be expressed
as xvib(t) = avib cos(2πfvibt + φvib), where avib, fvib and φvib are the amplitude, frequency and phase of the vibration,
respectively. If t0 is the start time of the scan, Eq. (2) can be re-written as

∼

If we approximate ν(t)

ν(t0) = ν, the measured optical path diﬀerence Lmeas may be expressed as

∼

∆N = L∆ν/c + 2[xvib(t)ν(t)

xvib(t0)ν(t0)]/c

Lmeas = Ltrue

t0)]

−

sin[πfvib(t + t0) + φvib]

−

×

(4)

where Ltrue is the true optical path diﬀerence in the absence of vibrations. If the path-averaged refractive index of
ambient air ¯ng is known, the measured distance is Rmeas = Lmeas/(2¯ng).

−

If the measurement window size (t

t0) is ﬁxed and the window used to measure a set of Rmeas is sequentially shifted,
the eﬀects of the vibration will be evident. We use a set of distance measurements in one scan by successively shifting
the ﬁxed-length measurement window one F-P peak forward each time. The arithmetic average of all measured Rmeas
values in one scan is taken to be the measured distance of the scan (although more sophisticated ﬁtting methods can
be used to extract the central value). For a large number of distance measurements Nmeas, the vibration eﬀects can
be greatly suppressed. Of course, statistical uncertainties from fringe and frequency determination, dominant in our
current system, can also be reduced with multiple scans. Averaging multiple measurements in one scan, however,
provides similar precision improvement to averaging distance measurements from independent scans, and is faster,
more eﬃcient, and less susceptible to systematic errors from drift. In this way, we can improve the distance accuracy
dramatically if there are no signiﬁcant drift errors during one scan, caused, for example, by temperature variation.
This multiple-distance-measurement technique is called ’slip measurement window with ﬁxed size’, shown in Fig.2.
However, there is a trade oﬀ in that the thermal drift error is increased with the increase of Nmeas because of the
larger magniﬁcation factor Ω for a smaller measurement window size.

Figure 2: The schematic of two multiple-distance-measurement techniques. The interference fringes from the femtowatt
photoreceiver and the scanning frequency peaks from the Fabry-Perot interferometer(F-P) for the optical ﬁber FSI system
recorded simultaneously by DAQ card are shown in black and red, respectively. The free spectral range(FSR) of two adjacent
F-P peaks (1.5 GHz) provides a calibration of the scanned frequency range.

In order to extract the amplitude and frequency of the vibration, another multiple-distance-measurement technique
called ’slip measurement window with ﬁxed start point’ is used, as shown in Fig.2. In Eq. (3), if t0 is ﬁxed, the

0816

measurement window size is enlarged one F-P peak for each shift, an oscillation of a set of measured Rmeas values
indicates the amplitude and frequency of vibration. This technique is not suitable for distance measurement because
there always exists an initial bias term, from t0, which cannot be determined accurately in our current system.

5. Absolute Distance and Vibration Measurement

The typical measurement residual versus the distance measurement number in one scan using the above technique
is shown in Fig.3(a), where the scanning rate was 0.5 nm/s and the sampling rate was 125 kS/s. Measured distances
minus their average value for 10 sequential scans are plotted versus number of measurements (Nmeas) per scan in
Fig.3(b). The standard deviations (RMS) of distance measurements for 10 sequential scans are plotted versus number
of measurements (Nmeas) per scan in Fig.3(c). It can be seen that the distance errors decrease with an increase of
Nmeas. The RMS of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is 1.6 µm if there is only one distance measurement
per scan (Nmeas = 1).
If Nmeas = 1200 and the average value of 1200 distance measurements in each scan is
considered as the ﬁnal measured distance of the scan, the RMS of the ﬁnal measured distances for 10 scans is 41 nm
for the distance of 449828.965 µm, the relative distance measurement precision is 91 ppb.

The standard deviation (RMS) of measured distances for 10 sequential scans is approximately 1.5 µm if there
is only one distance measurement per scan for closed box data. By using the multiple-distance-measurement tech-
nique, the distance measurement precisions for various closed box data with distances ranging from 10 cm to 70 cm
collected in the past year are improved signiﬁcantly; precisions of approximately 50 nanometers are demonstrated
under laboratory conditions, as shown in Table 1. All measured precisions listed in Table 1. are the RMS’s of
measured distances for 10 sequential scans. Two FSI demonstration systems, ’air FSI’ and ’optical ﬁber FSI’, are
constructed for extensive tests of multiple-distance-measurement technique, ’air FSI’ means FSI with the laser beam
transported entirely in the ambient atmosphere, ’optical ﬁber FSI’ represents FSI with the laser beam delivered to
the interferometer and received back by single-mode optical ﬁbers.

Table I: Distance measurement precisions for various setups using the multiple-distance-measurement technique.

Based on our studies, the slow ﬂuctuations are reduced to a negligible level by using the plastic box and PVC
pipes to suppress temperature ﬂuctuations. The dominant error comes from the uncertainties of the interference
fringes number determination; the fringes uncertainties are uncorrelated for multiple distance measurements. In this
case, averaging multiple distance measurements in one scan provides a similar precision improvement to averaging
distance measurements from multiple independent scans. But, for open box data, the slow ﬂuctuations are dominant,
on the order of few microns in our laboratory. The measurement precisions for single and multiple distance open-
box measurements are comparable, which indicates that the slow ﬂuctuations cannot be adequately suppressed by
using the multiple-distance-measurement technique. A dual-laser FSI system[6] intended to cancel the drift error is
currently under study in our laboratory .

In order to test the vibration measurement technique, a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) was employed to produce
0.01
vibrations of the retroreﬂector. For instance, the frequency of the controlled vibration source was set to 1.01
Hz with amplitude 9.5
1.5 nanometers. The magniﬁcation factors, distance measurement residuals and corrected
measurement residuals for 2000 measurements in one scan are shown in Fig.3(d), Fig.3(e) and Fig.3(f), respectively.
The extracted vibration frequencies and amplitudes using this technique, fvib = 1.025
0.3
nanometers, agree well with the expectation values.

In addition, vibration frequencies at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 Hz with controlled vibration amplitudes ranging
from 9.5 nanometers to 400 nanometers were studied extensively using our current FSI system. The measured
vibrations and expected vibrations all agree well within the 10-15% level for amplitudes, 1-2% for frequencies, where
we are limited by uncertainties in the expectations. Vibration frequencies far below 0.1 Hz can be regarded as slow
ﬂuctuations, which cannot be suppressed by the above analysis techniques.

Detailed information about estimation of major error sources for the absolute distance measurement and limitation

of our current FSI system is provided elsewhere[5].

6. Dual-Laser FSI System

A dual-laser FSI system has been built in order to reduce drift error and slow ﬂuctuations occuring during the
laser scan. Two lasers are operating simultaneously, the two laser beams are coupled into one optical ﬁber but
isolated by using two choppers. The principle of the dual-laser technique is shown in the following. For the ﬁrst
ǫ1, and ǫ is drift error during the laser scanning. For the second
laser, the measured distance D1 = Dtrue + Ω1
ǫ2. Since the two laser beams travel the same optical path during
laser, the measured distance D2 = Dtrue + Ω2
the same period, the drift errors ǫ1 and ǫ2 should be very comparable. Under this assumption, the true distance can
be extracted using the formula Dtrue = (D2
ρ), where, ρ = Ω2/Ω1, the ratio of magniﬁcation factors
from two lasers.

The laser beams are isolated by choppers periodically, so only half the fringes are recorded for each laser, degrading
the distance measurement precision. Missing fringes during chopped intervals for each laser must be recovered through
robust interpolation algorithms. The chopper edge transitions make this interpolation diﬃcult. Several techniques
are under study.

7. A Possible Silicon Tracker Alignment System

One possible silicon tracker alignment system is shown in Fig.4. The left plot shows lines of sight for alignment
in R-Z plane of the tracker barrel, the middle plot for alignment in X-Y plane of the tracker barrel, the right plot
for alignment in the tracker forward region. Red lines/dots show the point-to-point distances need to be measured
using FSIs. There are 752 point-to-point distance measurements in total for the alignment system. More studies are
needed to optimize the distance measurments grid.

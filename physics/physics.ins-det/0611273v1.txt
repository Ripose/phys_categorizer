Abstract

We report on the calibration of a superﬂuid 3He bolometer developed for the search
of non-baryonic Dark Matter. Precise thermometry is achieved by the direct mea-
surement of thermal excitations using Vibrating Wire Resonators (VWRs). The
heating pulses for calibration were produced by the direct quantum process of quasi-
particle generation by other VWRs present. The bolometric calibration factor is
analyzed as a function of temperature and excitation level of the sensing VWR.
The calibration is compared to bolometric measurements of the nuclear neutron
capture reaction and heat depositions by cosmic muons and low energy electrons.
The comparison allows a quantitative estimation of the ultra-violet scintillation rate
of irradiated helium, demonstrating the possibility of eﬃcient electron recoil event
rejection.

1 Introduction

Superﬂuid 3He-B at ultra-low temperatures is an appealing target material
for bolometric particle detection [1,2,3], with complimentary features to the
currently most performing germanium- and silicon-based detectors like Edel-
weiss [4] and CDMS [5]. Among the attractive features of 3He are the clear
signature of neutron background events due to the nuclear capture reaction
of neutrons in 3He. Furthermore, the huge density of unpaired neutrons leads
to a signiﬁcantly enhanced axial interaction cross-section within a large class
of WIMP models [6,7]. Its single thermal energy reservoir with the possibility
of direct thermometry, the very low experimental base temperature of about
100 µK, together with the possibility of electron recoil rejection make 3He a
very promising target material for Dark Matter search.

→

The nuclear neutron capture reaction 3He+n
3 H+p releases 764 keV kinetic
energy to its products, and was detected bolometrically in the superﬂuid [3].
The comparison of the detected neutron peak to bolometric calibrations of
the detector was then used [8] as a test of topological defect creation scenarios
in fast second order phase transitions [9]. A bolometric calibration method of
the detector was ﬁrst described in [10]. In the following years, the detection
threshold of the bolometer could be lowered, which allowed the identiﬁcation
of a broad peak at about 60 keV, that could be attributed to cosmic muons, in
agreement with numerical predictions. In very recent measurements on a Dark
Matter detector prototype, the detection threshold reached the keV level and
the low energy electron emission spectrum from a 57Co source could be resolved
[11,12]. Since a neutralino interaction with a 3He nucleus in the detector is
expected to deposit a maximum energy of about 5.6 keV, the current detector
design therefore already displays the required bolometric sensitivity.

The recent improvement of the sensitivity was partly made possible by low-
ering the working temperature of the detector cells from about 150 to 130
µK. This temperature decrease of less than 20% represents a decrease in the
thermal enthalpy of the cells by an order of magnitude. On the other hand,
at lower temperature the weaker coupling of the VWR to the superﬂuid re-
sults nevertheless in a greater response time of the thermometer. Parallely,
the non-linear velocity dependence of the friction with the superﬂuid [13], is
also of greater importance at the lower temperatures and the higher VWR-
response signals currently used. This article hence proposes a generalization
of the methods described in [10] for a more profound and comprehensive un-
derstanding of the bolometric detector (sections 2 to 4) and its calibration
by mechanical heater pulses (section 5). The comparison of the bolometric
calibration with detection spectra from known energy sources like neutrons
(section 6) as well as low energy electrons and muons (section 7) allows then
a precise estimation of the ultra-violet (UV) scintillation rate of helium for

2

several types of ionizing radiation.

2 Principle of detection

The current 3He particle detector [11,12] consists of[10] three adjacent cylin-
drical copper cells, of volume V = 0.13 cm3 each, immersed inside a superﬂuid
3He bath at ultra-low temperature, at about 130 µK. A 200 µm diameter ori-
ﬁce in the wall of the cells connects the 3He inside the cell with the surrounding
heat reservoir of superﬂuid. An energy deposition by an incident particle cre-
ates a cloud of quasiparticles in the cell, which comes to internal thermal
equilibrium via collisions on the cell walls within
1 ms. The excess ballistic
quasiparticles, of momentum p
pF , then leak out of the cell with a time
constant τb of a few seconds, which is determined mainly by the size of the
oriﬁce .

Fig. 1. Schematic setup of the 3-cell bolometric detector prototype. Each cell con-
tains a VWR thermometer. The cells are in weak thermal contact with the outer
3He bath through the oriﬁce. The presence of three adjacent cells allows discrimina-
tion through coincident detection. One of the cells contains the 57Co source (section
7), another one contains an extra VWR for the purpose of bolometric calibration
by heater pulses (section 5).

The Vibrating Wire Resonators (VWRs) used for thermometry are thin (4.5
µm diameter in our setup) superconducting NbTi ﬁlaments bent into an ap-
proximately semi-circular shape of a few mm, with both ends ﬁrmly ﬁxed [14].

≈

The VWR is driven by a Laplace force imposed by an AC current close to its
mechanical resonance frequency (
500 Hz), and oscillates perpendicularly to
its main plane with an rms velocity v. The motion is damped by frictional
forces, of total amplitude F (v), mainly due to momentum transfer to the
quasiparticles of the surrounding superﬂuid. Relatively fast thermometry is
then achieved by measuring continuously the damping coeﬃcient W
F/v
of a VWR driven at resonance. In the low oscillation velocity limit, the friction
v. W is thus velocity independent and can be written
is of a viscous type F
as [15]

∝

∝

W0 = α exp(

∆/kBT ),

−

(1)

where ∆ is the superﬂuid gap at zero temperature. The value of the prefactor
α is determined by both the microscopic properties of the liquid and the
geometry of the VWR. At 0 bar and for the VWRs used in the detector, of
density ρ = 6.0 g/cm3 and radius a = 2.3 µm, α is of the order of 1-2 105 Hz,
depending on the exact geometrical features. In quasi-static conditions, the
low velocity damping coeﬃcient W0 is measured as the Full Width at Half-
Height ∆f2 of the mechanical oscillator’s lorentzian resonance in frequency
space.

At ﬁnite oscillation velocities however, eﬀects beyond the two-ﬂuid model dis-
covered in Lancaster, lead to a velocity dependent friction which is actually
decreasing at higher velocities (Fig. 2). A model proposed by Fisher et al.
[13,15] leads to a velocity dependent damping

where the function

gives a very good approximation of the reduction of the damping of the VWR
for v up to a characteristic oscillation velocity v0

1-2 mm/s.

kBT /pF ≈

∼

At higher velocities, of about 3-4 mm/s, the local ﬂow ﬁeld around sharp edges
on the VWR surface starts to get turbulent [16]. At even higher velocities,
the critical velocity for pair-breaking is achieved. Both cases correspond to
a strong enhancement of the friction, with a strongly non-linear, sometimes
even discontinuous, velocity dependence (Fig. 2). While the Lancaster-type
non-linear coupling to the superﬂuid can easily be accounted for by using
equation (2), the velocity has thus still to be kept small enough for both the
locally turbulent and the pair-breaking regime to be avoided.

factor (section 4). At velocities above

This can therefore result in non-negligible response times (>1 s) for low damp-
ing coeﬃcients, i.e. narrow resonances and low temperatures. While recording
transitory heating events, the dynamically measured damping Wmes(t) is thus
a non-equilibrium measurement of W (t).

5 Bolometric calibration by heater pulses

At ultra-low temperatures, simulation of heating events by Joule heating is
ineﬃcient in superﬂuid 3He because of the diverging thermal (Kapitza) re-
sistance at the solid-liquid boundaries. Bradley et al. [3] proposed a heating
method of the superﬂuid, based on the mechanical friction of the oscillating
VWR with the liquid. Energy is injected through a second VWR present (the
”heater” VWR, as in the lowest of the 3 cells in Fig. 1), by driving it over a
short time with an excitation current at its resonance frequency. The energy
is then dissipated to the superﬂuid via the velocity dependent frictional cou-
pling. One should bare in mind that the electrically injected power is ﬁrstly
transformed into mechanical energy of the resonator before being transfered
to the liquid by friction. Therefore, even for a short excitation pulse of the
heater (δt
100 ms), the heat release to the liquid nevertheless takes place
on a characteristic timescale given by (4), where the damping W is relative to
the heater wire.

∼

The energy deposition by a heater pulse is hence not instantaneous, even in
the case of extremely short pulses. We have estimated quantitatively this heat
release, in order to verify wether a mechanical heater pulse is indeed an ac-
ceptable ’simulation’ of a real - instantaneous - event. If one assumes velocity
independent damping of the heater resonator, its amplitude of oscillation must
increase linearly during the pulse and then relax exponentially with timescale
τ . We have modeled numerically under these assumptions the heat release to
the superﬂuid in such a heater pulse, as well as the response of the thermome-
ter wire in the bolometric cell. One result and its comparison to the response
calculated for an instantaneous energy release as say by an incident particle,
are given in Fig. 4. One can see that even though the shape of the thermome-
ter’s response is quite diﬀerent, especially during the rise of the response, the
maximum amplitude is still the same within less than 1 % for Wbase > 0.3 Hz.
A ﬁt of the response by (6) is therefore not appropriate in the case of mechan-
ical heater pulses, while the geometrical maximum height H of the response
peak is still a good parameter for comparing pulses to instantaneous events.

A more serious issue for the bolometric calibration by mechanical heater pulses
are the intrinsic losses within the heater wire. The intrinsic damping (i.e. in
the absence of liquid) of a VWR can be well modelled by a viscous friction
term which therefore simply adds as a constant extra term Wint to the mea-
sured damping W in (1). In our experiment, we measure the heater VWR
intrinsic width as the limiting value of the damping in the low temperature
limit, to be W heater
6 mHz. As the thermal quasiparticle damping
vanishes at low temperatures, the intrinsic losses in the heater represent a
fraction W heater
) of the injected energy and constitute a
non-negligible correction to the energy injection through the heater wire.

Fig. 4. Simulation of the response of the thermometer VWR to an instantaneous
heat deposition at t = 1 s (dotted line) and to a mechanical heater pulse of same
total energy but releasing the heat slowly (continuous line) because of τ heater
. While
the response to the instantaneous event is well described by (6), the response to the
slow heat release has a diﬀerent shape during the rise, but is then rather identical
exept for a time shift due to the slower release of the energy by the heater. The
height H of the two peaks is nevertheless identical within 1 % at 0.3 Hz (128 µK)
and much less at higher temperatures.

w

Let us now consider the energy and velocity dependence of the detector re-
sponse. At constant oscillation velocity, the height H of the response is exper-
imentally observed to be linear in the injected energy in the range of a few
hundred keV (Fig. 5), which conﬁrms the assumptions leading to (8). Fur-
thermore, a comparison of the observed slopes versus the VWR’s oscillation
velocity (Fig. 6) are in good agreement with the enhancement of the response
at higher velocities, as given by (11). This analysis allows therefore to extract
the velocity independent limit of the calibration factor σ0.

Taking into account intrinsic losses in the heater as well as the features of the
thermometer VWR response deduced in the previous sections, one can ﬁt the
mechanical pulse calibration data versus baseline (i.e. versus temperature) as
shown in Fig. 7. If W heater
is left as a free parameter, the ﬁt yields a value
= 74 mHz and a calibration factor of σ0 = 3.8 10−4 Hz/keV at a
of W heater
int
baseline of 1 Hz (7). Imposing W heater
= 77 mHz leaves the overall prefactor
of σ0 (equivalent to the knowledge of α) as the only free ﬁtting parameter,
with a value only 0.5% diﬀerent.

The heat release to the superﬂuid following a nuclear neutron capture reaction
3H + p was observed in [8] to be at 0 bar about 15 % less than the
3He + n
764 keV known to be released by the reaction. For a microscopic calculation
of the stopping of the neutron capture products in 3He see [18]. A substantial
part of the energy deﬁcit can be attributed to ultra-violet (UV) scintillation
[19]. The UV fraction was estimated in [8] to account for about half of the
energy deﬁcit, concluding that the remaining
60 keV were trapped in the
form of topological defects.

≈

Neutrons are an extremely valuable tool for the characterization of the super-
ﬂuid bolometers because they provide a narrow and cell-geometry independent
peak at rather high energies. Once the bolometric heat release of neutrons in
3He inambiguously determined, no other calibration, e.g. by pulses, is nec-
essary. The comparison of the evolution of the observed neutron peak with
temperature also allows to test directly, without the use of mechanical heater
pulses, the assumptions leading to (12).

ature. The continuous line represents the temperature dependence of the expected
height H corresponding to the neutron peak as given by (12).

The dependence of the neutron peaks’ position on the baseline (i.e. on tem-
perature) is shown on Fig. 8. The agreement of the baseline dependence as

12

given by (12) is good except for the very lowest temperatures where an ab-
solute deviation from (12) of about 6 % is observed at Wbase=100 mHz. The
analysis yields a bolometric heat deposition of 652
20 keV at 0 bar, in very
good agreement with earlier measurements, where 650 keV were found under
the same conditions [8]. Wether the observed energy deﬁcit of about 110 keV
can be signiﬁcantly accounted for by topological defects is nevertheless still an
open question. An extensive study of the pressure dependence of this deﬁcit
is in progress and might give some new insight on this question [20].

7 Scintillation yield in helium of muons and low energy electrons

The detection of electrons of 7 and 14 keV emitted by a 57Co source within one
superﬂuid 3He-B bolometer has been reported recently [12]. The comparison
of the detected electron spectrum with the bolometric calibration factor of
that cell, determined as described in sections 2-5, yields a deﬁcit of 25
5 %
in the bolometrically detected energy. We therefore deﬁne the scintillation
yield in the following as the fraction of the injected energy that is released as
radiation.

±

In helium, the distance between two consecutive collisions of electrons in the
keV range is a fraction of a µm. This distance is much larger than that in the
case of α-particles or the neutron capture products. Upon electron irradiation,
the energy is hence deposited with much lower density and at no time the
density of heat is such that the superﬂuid could heat up to the normal state.
In the case of electrons, the energy deﬁcit is therefore entirely due to UV
scintillation. The scintillation yield is very sensitive to the density of the energy
deposition. Our results can be compared to measurements by Adams et al. [21]
who ﬁnd a 35 % UV scintillation yield in 4He upon irradiation by electrons
of a few hundred keV. Nevertheless, as later emphasized by McKinsey et al.
[19,22], this measurement only covered the fast emission pulse of the ﬁrst 10-
20 nanoseconds. A substantial part of the UV emission, estimated to
50 %
of the fast pulse contribution by these authors, takes place at much later
times, which brings the UV scintillation yield to a total of about 50 % for high
energy electrons. At lower energies on the keV level, this fraction is expected
to decrease rapidly. Our ﬁndings of the scintillation rate at
10 keV represent
thus a very reasonable low energy extension of the measurements by McKinsey
et al.

∼

∼

The muon events also display in our detector a clearly resolved spectrum.
Figure 9 shows data taken from [23], comparing numerical simulations to
measurements taken within the MACHe3 collaboration on the muon peak.
A GEANT 4.0 code computer simulation of the muon energy release in our
3He cell, integrated over a large spectrum of incident muon energies, leads to

13

a broad peak at about 67 keV. The dispersion of the energy distribution is a
result of the muons tracks crossing the cell geometry in all space directions
with the known angular dependence of radiation intensity [23]. The muon en-
ergy release to the target material is rather independent on the energy of the
incident muons in the range from 1 to 10 GeV covering the maximum of the
energy distribution of muons at ground level.

The width of the experimentally detected muon spectrum corresponds to the
intrinsic resolution of our detector (3 % ) combined to the geometrical broad-
ening. The muons produce exclusively electron recoils in the cell producing
delta rays, i.e. electrons scattered from the atomic shells, energy-distributed
following E−2
. For one incident muon, roughly 10 of such electrons have an
e
energy greater than 250 eV and only 5 greater than 1 keV.

In our experiment we have collected data in the muon energy range (Fig. 9)
during 19 hours. A broad maximum of events with an average energy of 52
keV is clearly seen. The comparison between the bolometric measurement and
the simulation of the energy input by muons therfore yields again an energy
deﬁcit of about 25 %. The missing energy being the result of the scintillation
of UV photons as for incident electrons, this observed deﬁcit again allows to
quantify the scintillation rate of helium for this type of irradiation.

We have presented a detailed description of the method of bolometric calibra-
tion of the detector cells based on superﬂuid 3He, by mechanical pulses. This
description provides a general and comprehensive picture of the bolometer
under diﬀerent conditions of use (excitation level, temperature).

The results of the calibration are compared to measured heat depositions by
the nuclear neutron capture reactions as well as muon impacts and low energy
electron irradiation. A deﬁcit of about 15 % is found in the case of neutrons,
in good agreement with previous measurements at 0 bar [8], in which case this
deﬁcit is partly associated to vortex creation. In the case of high energy muons,
as well as electrons in the 10 keV range, a deﬁcit of about 25 % is found which
can be entirely attributed to UV scintillation emission. It is not surprising to
ﬁnd the scintillation rates resulting from these two types of irradiation to be
of the same order since the much larger incident energy of cosmic muons is
compensated by their larger mass.

Now that our detector has achieved the required sentitivity for resolving recoils
in the keV energy range, we focused on the the feasibility of a electron recoil
rejection by parallel scintillation detection. Since we found the UV scintillation
yield not to be small for both electrons and muons down to the energy range
of interest, this result gives experimental evidence that the parallel use of
a scintillation detector would allow to reject eﬃciently electron-, muon- and
most likely γ-contamination in a bolometric detector based on superﬂuid 3He
for the search of non-baryonic Dark Matter. The optimum design of such a
parallel scintillation detector will be discussed in a future work.

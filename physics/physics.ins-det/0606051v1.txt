ACORDE is one of the ALICE detectors, presently under construction at CERN. It consists of an array of
plastic scintillator counters placed on the three upper faces of the ALICE magnet. It will act as a cosmic ray
trigger, and, together with other ALICE sub-detectors, will provide precise information on cosmic rays with
primary energies around 1015 ÷ 1017 eV. Here we describe the design of ACORDE along with the present status
and integration into ALICE.

1. Introduction

At CERN, the use of large underground high-
energy physics experiments, for comic ray stud-
ies, has an important tradition [1]. ALICE is an
experiment mainly designed to study the prod-
ucts of nucleus-nucleus collisions at CERN Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) [2]. The underground
location of the ALICE detector, with 30 m of
overburden composed of subalpine molasse, is an
ideal place for muon based underground experi-
ments. Using this facilities, we plan to observe
muon bundles generated by cosmic ray primary
particles with energies around the knee region
1015÷1017eV [3]. ACORDE (the ALICE COsmic
Ray DEtector) is an array of scintillator modules
that will act as a cosmic ray trigger for ALICE
calibration, as well as, multiple muon trigger to
study high energy cosmic rays.

sides of the central ALICE magnet, as shown in
Figure 1. More modules, to achieve a better angu-
lar coverage and acceptance, will be added later.
Each module, see Figure 2, consists of two plas-
tic scintillator paddles with 188 × 20 cm2 eﬀective
area, arranged in a doublet conﬁguration. Each
doublet consists of two superimposed scintillator
counters, with their corresponding photomultipli-
ers active faces, looking back to back. A coinci-
dence signal, in a time window of 40 ns, from the
two scintillator paddles gives, for each module,
the trigger hit. A PCI BUS electronics card have
been developed in order to measure plateau and
eﬃciency of the module counters [4]. The signal
of each ACORDE scintillator channel is applied
to a leading edge discriminator. After the con-
version of each PMT negative signal in a digital
hit, a single or a multi-coincidence trigger signal
is generated. In both cases we will use a track-
ing system to identify which ACORDE modules
were hit. Afterwards, these module hit informa-
tion will be stored in a FIFO memory before being
sent to the DAQ system through the Detectors
Data Link (DDL).

3. The ALICE Cosmic Ray Trigger

The cosmic ray trigger system (CRT) will pro-
vide a fast level-zero trigger signal to the cen-
tral trigger processor, when atmospheric muons
impinge upon the ALICE detector. The signal
will be useful for calibration, alignment and per-
formance of several ALICE tracking detectors,
mainly the ALICE Time Projection Chamber
(TPC), the ALICE Transition Radiation Detec-
tor (TRD) and the ALICE Inner Tracking Sys-
tem (ITS). The typical rate for single atmospheric
muons crossing the ALICE cavern will be less
than Hz/m2. The expected rate for multi-muon
events will be around or less than 0.04 Hz/m2.
Atmospheric muons will need an energy of at least
17 GeV to reach the ALICE hall, while the upper
energy limit for reconstructed muons in the TPC
will be less than 2 TeV, depending on the ALICE
magnetic ﬁeld intensity (up to 0.5 T). We have de-
signed and implemented the necessary electronics
to do the following tasks: LHC clock synchroniza-
tion, send single and multi-muon trigger signal
to the Central Trigger processor, send a wake-up
signal to ALICE-TRD and communicate with the
DAQ through a DAQ Source Interface card(SIU).
Also, we complete the ACORDE Detector Con-
trol System, to monitor the performance of the
scintillator counter array.

At the present, we have 20 ACORDE modules
already installed and the related electronics work-
ing. The ALICE-TPC above ground commission-

ing is proceeding based on ACORDE trigger us-
ing 10 modules placed on the top and 10 under-
neath the ALICE TPC (see [5]).

4. Summary

We have implemented a dedicated cosmic ray
trigger for ALICE which in conjunction with
other ALICE detectors provides a powerful tool
for the study of muon bundles properties.

On the measurement of frequency and of its
sample variance with high-resolution counters

Enrico Rubiola∗

Rev. 1.0, 21st February 2014

Abstract

A frequency counter measures the input frequency ν averaged over a
suitable time τ , versus the reference clock. High resolution is achieved
by interpolating the clock signal. Further increased resolution is obtained
by averaging multiple frequency measurements highly overlapped. In the
presence of additive white noise or white phase noise, the uncertainty
improves from δν/ν ∼ 1/τ 2 to δν/ν ∼ 1/τ 3. Surprisingly, when a ﬁle of
contiguous data is fed into the formula of the two-sample (Allan) variance
2 (yk+1 − yk)2} of the fractional frequency ﬂuctuation y, the
σy(τ ) = E{ 1
result is the modiﬁed Allan variance mod σy(τ ). But if a suﬃcient number
of contiguous measures are averaged in order to get a longer τ and the
data are fed into the same formula, the results is the (non-modiﬁed) Allan
variance. Of course interpretation mistakes are beyond the corner if the
counter internal process is not well understood.

1 Background

Let v(t) = sin 2πνt = sin[2πν00t + ϕ(t)] the input signal, where ϕ(t) is the phase
ﬂuctuation, ν00 = 1/T00 is the nominal frequency (the double subscript ‘00’, as
in ν00, is used to avoid confusion with the 0-th term of a time series; thus, ν00
is the same as ν0 commonly used in the literature, etc.), and ν(t) = ν00 + ˙ϕ
2π
is the instantaneous frequency. Finally, let x(t) = ϕ
2πν00 the phase time ﬂuc-
tuation, i.e., the time jitter, and y(t) = ˙ϕ
ν00
the fractional frequency
ﬂuctuation. The notation used in this article is the same of the general refer-
ences about frequency stability and noise [BCC+72, Rut78, CCI90, Vig99].

In the presence of slow random phenomena, the variance depends on the mea-
surement time and on the number of samples. This is related to the fact that
the algorithm used is a ﬁlter in the frequency domain, whose lower cutoﬀ fre-
quency is set by the number of samples. Other variances are to be used, based
on the idea that the estimator, clearly speciﬁed, has a lower cutoﬀ frequency

that blocks the dc and long-term components of noise. There results a variance
which is a function of the measurement time τ . Table 1 shows the spectral
properties of the Allan variance and of the modiﬁed Allan variance, deﬁned
underneath.

1.1 Allan variance (AVAR)

Originally, the Allan variance was introduced as a measurement tool for the
frequency ﬂuctuation of atomic clocks [All66]. Given a stream of contiguous
data yk averaged on a time τ , the simplest variance is the (classical) variance
evaluated on two samples, σ2

which is similar to a wavelet variance. The weight function diﬀers from the

In the frequency domain, the AVAR is similar to a half-octave bandpass
ﬁlter with the peak at the frequency of 1
2τ .

1.2 Modiﬁed Allan variance (MVAR)

Another type of variance commonly used in time and frequency metrology is
the modiﬁed Allan variance mod σy(τ ) [AB81, LA84]. This variance was ﬁrst
introduced in the domain of optics [Sny80] because it divides white phase noise
from ﬂicker phase noise, which the AVAR does not. This is often useful in fast
measurements. The MVAR is deﬁned as

2 High-resolution frequency counters

In this section the phase noise ϕ(t), and therefore the frequency noise y(t), is
provisionally assumed to be a zero-mean stationary process. This hypothesis
will no longer necessary for the direct measurement of the Allan variance.

Traditionally, the uniform average over a suitable time interval τ is used as an
estimator of the frequency ν. The expectation of ν is therefore

2.2 Enhanced-resolution counters

More sophisticated counters make use of the Λ estimator (Fig. 3), which consists
of a triangular-weight average. The counter takes a series of n measures ν i =
N/τi delayed by iτ00 = iDT , where τi = tN +iD
is the
time interval measured from the (iD)-th to the (N + iD)-th zero crossings. The
expectation of ν is evaluated as the average

underneath. The counter noise is due to the interpolator noise, and to the noise
of the input trigger. The samples of the interpolator jitter are independent
because the interpolator is restarted every time is used. The trigger noise spans
from dc to the trigger bandwidth B, which is at least the maximum switching
frequency of the counter. With nowadays instruments, B is hardly lower than
100 MHz, hence white noise is dominant. The autocorrelation function of the
trigger noise is a sharp pulse of duration TR
1/B. On the other hand, the
delay τ00 is lower-bounded by the period T00 of the input signal and by the
conversion time of the interpolator. The latter may take a few microseconds.

At low input frequency, there is no reason for the delay τ00 between overlapped
measures ν i and νi+1 to be longer than T00, i.e., one period. Thus D = 1,
τ00 = T00, and n = N = ν00τ . Hence Eq. (18) is rewritten as

At high input frequency, the minimum delay τ00 is set by the conversion time
of the interpolator. Hence the measurement rate is limited to νI measures per
second, the number n of overlapped measures is n = νI τ
ν00τ , and Eq. (18)
turns into

The law σ2
1/τ 3, either (19) or (20), is a property of the Λ estimator in
the presence of white noise. This property is the main reason for having intro-
duced the Λ estimator in frequency counters. Yet it is to made clear that the

enhanced resolution is achieved by averaging on multiple measurements, even
though overlapped, and that the measurement of a single event, like a start-stop
time interval, can not be improved in this way.

2.3 Understanding technical information

Searching through the instruction manual of frequency counters and through
the manufacturer web sites, one observes that the problem of the estimation is
generally not addressed. When the counter is of the Π type, the measurement
mechanism is often explained with a ﬁgure similar to Fig. 2. On the other
hand, the explanation for the overlapped measurements in Λ-type counters is
not found in the technical documentation. As a further element of confusion,
both counters provide one vaue every τ seconds when programmed to measure
over the time τ . This can lead the experimentalist to erroneously assume that
the estimation is always of the Π type.

The internal estimation mechanism can be understood from the formula
for the “frequency error”, often given in the technical documentation. These
formulae are of the form

(Π) σy =

2(δt)2

trigger + 2(δt)2

interpolator

or

where νI is of the order of 200 kHz. The actual formulae may diﬀer in that
uncertainty and noise of the reference frequency may be included or not; in that
the factor 2 in the interpolator noise does not appear explicitely; and in other
details.

The terms inside the square root of (21) and (22) come from independent
white noise processes, as explained in Sections 2.1. Thus, one can match Eq. (21)
to (13), and Eq. (22) to (18). Consequently, the presence of a term τ in the
denominator reveals that the counter is of the Π type, while the presence of the
term τ √n or τ √τ reveals that the counter is of the Λ type.

AVAR. Let us get a stream of data y(1)
from the output of a Π-estimator
k
counter, measured over a base time slot τB with zero dead time. Feeding this
stream into Eq. (1), one gets Eq. (2) with τ = τB. Then, after averaging
contiguous data in groups of m, one gets a smaller ﬁle of y(m)
, averaged over
mτB. Feeding this new ﬁle into Eq. (1), one gets Eq. (2) with τ = mτB. This
is exactly what one expects. It is a common practice to get the plot of σ2
y(τ ) in
this way, with m in powers of 2.

MVAR. The data ﬁle y(1)
k can also be fed in Eq. (6). In this case the hardware-
deﬁned measurement time τB is the delay τ0 of (6), and the variance is evaluated
at τ = nτB.

3.2 Λ-type counters.

The attention of the reader is now to be drawn to a subtilty in the use of a
Λ-estimator to measure the Allan variance. While the counter provides one
value of ν every τB seconds, two contiguous windows wΛ(t) and wΛ(t
τB) are
overlapped by τB. That is, the falling side of wΛ(t) overlaps the rising side of
wΛ(t

the wM window. The practical consequence is that, feeding the ﬁle of such y(1)

into Eq. (1) (AVAR), one gets exactly Eq. (6) with τ = τB. That is, MVAR

A longer measurement time τ is obtained by averaging contiguous data in
groups of m. This process yields a smaller ﬁle of y(m)
, averaged over mτB. Yet
the measurements are overlapped, for the weight function, which is the triangle
wΛ for m = 1, turns into an isosceles trapezium for m > 1, and asymptotically
into the rectangle wΠ for large m. This is shown in Fig. 4. The practical
consequence is that, feeding the ﬁle of y(m)
into Eq. (1), one gets an “odd”
variance for with small m > 1, i.e., a variance that is neither AVAR or MVAR;
and again the AVAR for large m.

Finally, we focus the attention to two asymptotic classes of measurement,

namely short-term stability and long-term stability, analyzed underneath.

Long-term stability. This measurements are characterized by a large value
of m. Hence the averaging function converges to wΠ, thus the data ﬁle y(m)
can
be fed into the AVAR formula (1) without mistakes. This is a fortunate outcome
for two reasons, namely (1) the Allan variance is preferable to the mod Allan
because with the same duration of the time record it provides a more accurate
estimate at large τ and (2) the rejection of white phase noise of the MVAR is
not necessary in long term measurements.

k

Short-term stability. The experimentalist interested in short-term stability
appreciates the rejection of white noise of the MVAR, while the longer duration

3.3 Other methods

For long-term measurements, the total variance TVAR [GHP99] is progressively
being used as an estimator of the AVAR. The importance of the TVAR resides
in that, given a record if measured data, it gives better accuracy at larger τ .
Yet TVAR is based on rectangular averages, hence the readout of a Λ estimator
can not be fed in the formula for TVAR without interpretation mistakes.

Another useful method, known as the picket-fence method, [Gre89, Gre97]
can be used to measure AVAR, MVAR, and TVAR. It consists of the absolute
timing of the zero crossings versus a time scale, as in Fig. 2 or 3. In this case,
there is no preprocessing insider the counter, therefore there is no ambiguity in
the interpretation of the results.

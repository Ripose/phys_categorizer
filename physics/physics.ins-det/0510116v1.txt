B-identiﬁcation for Level 2: The Silicon Track Trigger at DØ

This article describes the Silicon Track Trigger (STT) which has been fully commissioned in 2004 at the DØ
experiment. The STT allows to enrich already at the second trigger level the data sample with events containing
B-mesons. The STT achieves this by providing within about 50µs tracks with an impact parameter resolution of
around 50µm. The article shows preliminary results of the trigger performance and presents a fast b-identiﬁcation
algorithm for the second trigger level.

1. Introduction

The discovery of the Higgs boson is one of the
main objectives of high energy physics today. Es-
pecially at the Tevatron this is a very diﬃcult
task, because it requires to study all possible de-
cay channels with the best achievable eﬃciency.
The overwhelming amount of light quarks pro-
duced by QCD processes swamps interesting sig-
nals with b-quarks like pp → H → bb or the im-
portant calibration process pp → Z → bb. Even
Higgs processes with the associated production of
additional b-jets or neutrinos (HZ → bbνν) have
huge background from light quark jets , such that
the limited trigger bandwidth of an experiment
results in a loss of some of those events. Physics
topics as the study of low PT B-physics face sim-
ilar performance issues.

If the early trigger levels of an experiment
cannot discriminate between light quarks and b-
quarks, both will be reduced by an equal factor.
The Silicon Track Trigger (STT)[1] , however, can
early recognize events where a b-quark was pro-
duced and dominantly pass those events, reduc-
ing the background eﬀectively. B mesons lead to
trajectories of the order of millimeter before they
decay. The trajectories of the decay products do

gramme.

not point back to the vertex of the primary in-
teraction. Hence the measurement of the impact
parameter allows the separation of interesting b-
events from events containing only lighter quarks.
The impact parameter (or distance of closest ap-
proach) is the minimum distance between the pri-
mary interaction point and the particles trajec-
tory. Note that such a method, unlike the usual
selection of B-meson via muon decays, works for
all decay modes and provides a less biased sample
of decay modes in the selected b-event sample.

In RunII the DØ experiment also selects b-
events using the high resolution Silicon Microstrip
Detector (SMT) to reconstruct the tracks of the
charged particles in the event and by feeding the
track information into b-identiﬁcation algorithms.
Without the Silicon Track Trigger this can only
be performed in oﬄine analyzes and the third
trigger level. Since early 2004 the STT provides
the capability of a fast selection of events with
large impact parameter. This allows B-meson
identiﬁcation already at the second trigger level.

2. The STT in the DØ trigger framework

The DØ experiment triggers events in three
stages [2]. Several sub-detectors provide infor-
mation to make a decision. At DØ the ﬁrst level
(L1) trigger system is a hardware system ﬁltering
the 2.5 MHz beam crossing rate with a minimal
dead time to an accept rate of about 2 kHz. A

calorimeter trigger looks for energy depositions of
high transverse energy; the central track trigger
(CTT) and the muon trigger provide tracks.

The second level trigger (L2) receives informa-
tion from all major detectors to build a trigger
decision using hardware and software algorithms.
Each major DØ detector component has a cor-
responding L2 preprocessor, the STT is the pre-
processor of the Silicon Microstrip Detector. The
information of all the L2 preprocessors are sent
to the L2 global processor, which can run ﬁlter
algorithms to select the events and sends the in-
formation to the third trigger level. To maintain
an acceptable dead time the mean decision time
for L2 must be about 100µs. The L2 output rate
is about 1 kHz. Finally, the third level software
trigger partially reconstructs the events using a
farm of processors and reduces the rate to 50 Hz,
which is recorded for oﬄine analysis.

3. How does the STT work?

The DØ tracking system consists of the Silicon
Microstrip Tracker and the Central Fiber Tracker
(CFT) both located in an about 2 Tesla solenoidal
magnetic ﬁeld. The STT uses both devices to
reconstruct the trajectories of charged particles.
In the ﬁrst trigger level the Central Track Trig-
ger can reconstruct tracks with a minimum pT
of 1.5 GeV using information from the three
scintillator-based detectors, the Central Fiber
Tracker and the central and forward preshower
detectors. The CFT consists of about 80000 scin-
tillating ﬁbers and because of its fast readout
time its information can already be used in the
ﬁrst trigger level. The position resolution with-
out the Silicon Tracker is, however, not suﬃcient
to provide precise information of the particle de-
cay lengths.

The SMT has six central barrels with four sil-
icon layers each and in total about 800000 read-
out channels. The barrel sensors parallel to the
beam pipe are used for the STT. They have a
50µm pitch width. Oﬄine tracks made using the
SMT have an impact parameter resolution of up
to 15−20µm for high pT tracks, which is suﬃcient
to detect B-mesons.

The STT uses the Level 1 tracks provided by

the CTT as seeds to deﬁne ’roads’ into the SMT
(see Fig. 1) . These roads are cylinders of ±2mm
radius around each CTT track. The STT forms
clusters from the pedestal subtracted SMT hits
and only clusters within these roads are consid-
ered for track ﬁtting. Clusters are made by sum-
ming up a group of contiguous strips above some
threshold.

The STT design divides the SMT into 12 sec-
tors, each 30 degrees in the azimuthal angle φ and
the track ﬁtting is performed in parallel for each
of the sectors. Almost no eﬃciency loss is caused
by tracks crossing sectors. The electronics for two
sectors house in one of the 6 STT crates. Data
of the same sector of all 6 SMT barrel detectors
has to be routed to one crate. Each crate has one
Fiber Road Card which receives and distributes
the Level 1 tracks and communicates with the
trigger framework. In each crate 9 Silicon Trig-
ger Cards perform a pedestal correction, followed
by the clustering of the SMT hits and associate
the clusters to the roads.

The information of the Fiber Road Card and
Silicon Trigger cards is then sent to the two Track
Fit Cards. The Track Fit Cards receive the roads
and axial clusters and convert them via a large
lookup table to physical coordinates. Then the
two dimensional track ﬁt is performed in the r −φ
plane with the form φ(r) = b/r + κr + φ0. Here
b is the impact parameter with respect to the de-

tector origin, κ is the tracks curvature and φ0 is
the φ angle of the track at the distance of closest
approach. The Track Fit Cards uses the clusters
which are closest to the CTT track and performs
a ﬁt if clusters are found in three or more SMT
layers. The track parameters are obtained by a
integer χ2 method, which minimizes the cluster-
track residuals using matrices stored in an on-
board lookup table. The track parameter is cor-
rected for the beam spot position oﬀset of the
previous data taking run. The output consists
of the track parameters, the χ2 of the ﬁt among
other information. The data is send to the L2
CTT preprocessor which merges it with Level 1
CTT information, formats the data and sends it
to the L2 global processor. The track parameters
are provided on average in about 50µs.

4. A B-identiﬁcation algorithm for Level 2

Combining tracks oﬄine with B-identiﬁcation
algorithms greatly enhances the performance of
an experiment to detect B-mesons, obviously this
may also work at Level 2. A problem is that the
current oﬄine algorithms are not fast enough to
be run in less than 10 − 20µs. The algorithm
described in the following uses the STT tracks as
input to an eﬃcient multivariate b-identiﬁcation
and is fast enough to be run on the L2 global
processor in less than 1 − 5µs.

The method uses the ratio of the probability
density functions of the signal prediction to the
background prediction. The signal is given by
data events with a soft oﬄine B-identiﬁcation ,
while background events are events without any
oﬄine B-identiﬁcation. The two-dimensional sig-
nal, pdfi,S, and background, pdfi,B, probability
densities are derived with a smoothing method
as a function of the track impact parameter sig-
niﬁcance and the track χ2 of the track ﬁt. The
impact parameter signiﬁcance is given by IPsig =
IP/σ(IP ), where σ(IP ) only includes the PT de-
pendent eﬀects of multiple Coulomb scattering
and IP is the impact parameter. Using χ2 in
the pdf downgrades badly ﬁtted tracks without
cutting them and loosing eﬃciency. Tracks with
a larger χ2 still have limited lifetime informa-
tion as can be seen from Figure 2. For the trig-

ger the signal-to-background ratios r(IPsig, χ2) =
pdfS(IPsig, χ2)/pdfB(IPsig, χ2) are stored in a
lookup table.

The ﬁnal discriminant is then derived by a loop
over the 5 tracks with highest impact parameter,
accessing r(IPsig, χ2) for each track and multi-
plying these values:

5. Performance studies

The STT is fully operational since May 2004.
Figure 3 shows the impact parameter resolution
of the STT as a function of the PT of the track
as determined with a recent data run. At the
time of writing this article (Aug. 2005) a cut on
two tracks with an impact parameter signiﬁcance
> 2 or > 3 and χ2 < 5.5 are implemented as L2
trigger requirement.

We show the STT B-identiﬁcation performance
by comparing a dijet sample without any oﬄine
b-tag (as background events) and a dijet sample

ﬁndings are corroborated by using other oﬄine
B-selections as signal events.

6. Summary and Outlook

The Silicon Track Trigger is a new component
of the DØ second level trigger. It is since 2004 in
smooth and stable operation and allows to iden-
tify B-meson production by selecting events with
a large impact parameter. It has a high poten-
tial of enhancing the potential of several physics
analyzes that rely on B-identiﬁcation. The im-
plementation of a new SMT layer (Layer0) in the
next shutdown period will further increase the
precision and stability of the STT.

Abstrat

The optial properties of the (cid:16)bialkali(cid:17) KCsSb and RbCsSb photomultiplier athodes

have been experimentally investigated in the visible range. The measurements ar-

ried out inlude the absolute re(cid:29)etane at near-normal inidene, the polarization-

dependent relative re(cid:29)etane at various angles and the hange in polarization upon

re(cid:29)etion from the photoathode. These experimental inputs have been ombined

with a theoretial model to determine the omplex refrative index of the photo-

athodes in the wavelength range [380 nm, 680 nm] and their thikness. As a result

of this work, we derive a model whih predits the fration of light impinging on

a photomultiplier tube that is re(cid:29)eted, absorbed or transmitted, as a funtion of

wavelength and angle, and dependent on the medium to whih the photomultiplier

is oupled.

Introdution

Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with bialkali photoathodes are widely used

in astrophysis, nulear and partile physis. In many ases, the only optial

property of a PMT of interest for the design of an experiment is its spetral sen-

sitivity, i.e. the fration of photons onverted into deteted photoeletrons as

a funtion of the wavelength (Fig. 1). Reent developments in partile physis,

espeially in neutrino physis, have led to the onstrution or proposal of sev-

eral multi-ton up to megaton detetors, in whih the interations are deteted

either via Cherenkov light in water (or ie) or via sintillation light from or-

gani liquid sintillators [1,2,3,4,5,6℄. Data analysis in these experiments is

based on the omparison with the preditions of Monte Carlo simulations,

whih typially do not inlude a detailed desription of light interation with

the PMTs.

R(λ, θ)

Three proesses are possible for a photon impinging on a PMT:

(1) Absorption in the photoathode, with probability A(λ, θ)

(2) Re(cid:29)etion from the PMT window or photoathode, with probability R(λ, θ)

(3) Transmission inside the PMT, with probability T (λ, θ) = 1 − A(λ, θ) −

In ase of absorption, a photoeletron is produed, whih has a ertain prob-

ability to esape the layer towards the interior of the PMT, to be aelerated

to the (cid:28)rst dynode and start an avalanhe, resulting in a detetable signal. It

is onvenient to express the probability that a photon ontributes to a signal

as the produt of two probabilities:

QE(λ, θ) = A(λ, θ) × Pconv(λ)

(1)

2

where A(λ, θ) is the probability that the photon is absorbed in the photoath-

ode, whih is a funtion of the wavelength λ and the inidene angle θ, and

Pconv is the onversion fator for suh absorption to result in an avalanhe.

Pconv depends on λ (due to the di(cid:27)erent kineti energy transferred to the pho-

toeletron in the absorption proess), and - not inluded in Eq. 1 - on the

loation of the photon absorption on the PMT surfae and the operating high

voltage. Pconv is here assumed independent of θ, as demonstrated in [7℄.

The probability QE(λ, θ) is the Quantum E(cid:30)ieny. In Fig. 1 the typial

QE spetra are shown for two of the most ommonly used photoathodes: the

blue-sensitive bialkali (KCsSb ) and the green-enhaned bialkali (RbCsSb ). The

urves are usually measured in air for light impinging at near normal inidene

(θ ∼ 0).

For most appliations the information in Fig. 1 is su(cid:30)ient, sine it hara-

terizes the PMT detetion e(cid:30)ieny for (cid:16)standard(cid:17) operations. However, the

physis of light interation with the PMT is more omplex. First, the QE is

not only a funtion of λ, but also of θ; seond, in many detetors the PMTs are

typially oupled to media with n > 1, and not to air; last, the probabilities

R(λ, θ) and T (λ, θ) are not impliit in Eq. 1.

A preise knowledge of the photoathode optial properties would allow the

funtions QE(λ, θ), R(λ, θ) and T (λ, θ) to be predited for a PMT in ontat

with any medium. In spite of the great importane of this issue for detetor-

modeling, surprisingly very little is doumented in the literature. A ma jor

breakthrough was aomplished by Moorhead and Tanner [8℄ (hereafter re-

ferred to as M&T), who measured the optial onstants of a KCsSb bialkali

photoathode in a EMI 9124B PMT at the wavelength of λ = 442 nm, for im-

3

plementation in the MC simulation of the SNO experiment [5℄. The method

they used gave them the ability to break the ambiguity in the optial on-

stants typial of this kind of determinations. In their work M&T also tried to

dedue the wavelength dependene of the photoathode refrative index, by

reinterpreting and reanalyzing earlier measurements at few other wavelengths

in the visible spetrum reported in [9℄. Later on, Lang used M&T's tehnique

to hek their measurements on the same photoathode and to extend the

investigation to several other photoathodes [10℄, inluding the RbCsSb. Lay

subsequently exploited the same tehnique to study the performane of sev-

eral Hamamatsu R1408 PMTs used in SNO [7℄. However, all of the above

measurements were limited to the single wavelength λ = 442 nm.

The ob jetive of this work was to extend the existing measurements on the

KCsSb and RbCsSb photoathodes by overing the whole visible spetrum

and onsequently to predit the interation of visible light with bialkali PMTs

in any experimental ondition. The two investigated photoathodes are the

most usual hoie in partile physis. The former is suitable for the detetion

of Cherenkov light and sintillation light from primary (cid:29)uors, the latter en-

sures good blue-green sensitivity and mathes better the emission spetra of

seondary (cid:29)uors (wavelength-shifters) in three-omponent organi sintillator

mixtures.

The original motivation for this work was to study the impat on the solar

neutrino Yb-LENS experiment [11,12,13℄ of light re(cid:29)etions from PMTs. The

signature of a νe interation with the target nulide

176Y b is a delayed e− − γ

oinidene with life time τ = 50 ns. A modular design is envisaged, with

Yb dissolved in an organi liquid sintillator. In the investigated detetor

onept, a fration of the primary sintillation light re(cid:29)ets o(cid:27) the PMTs

4

and is eventually deteted at a later time, with a delay given by the time of

propagation through a module. This delay is of the order of ∼ 30 ns for a

typial module length of ∼ 4 m, hene PMTs-re(cid:29)eted light falls in the time-

window of the ν -signature. Consequently, re(cid:29)etions ontribute to inrease the

probability that single events are misidenti(cid:28)ed as orrelated double events, i.e.

νe -andidates [14℄.

More in general, the study of light re(cid:29)etions from the PMTs is of onern in

all detetors where this re(cid:29)eted light an ause a delayed signal. For exam-

ple, in Borexino (and similarly in KamLAND) re(cid:29)etions weaken the α − β

disrimination power, whih is based on the fat that the exitation of organi

sintillators from α-partiles reate a larger fration of late light ompared to

the exitation from eletrons [1℄.

Another appliation of the optial model of PMTs is the predition of the

angular dependene of the QE, for a PMT operated in air as well as in liquid.

2 Theory and Methodology

2.1 Introdution

The photoathode of a PMT is a thin layer of a multi-alkali semiondut-

ing alloy, whih is evaporated onto the bak side of the glass window during

prodution. Light impinging on a photoathode is in part re(cid:29)eted, in part ab-

sorbed and in part transmitted. The photoathode thikness is a ompromise

aiming at maximizing the probability that a photon results in a signal: if the

layer is too thin, little light an be absorbed; if it is too thik, the resulting

5

photoeletrons annot e(cid:30)iently esape from the photoathode.

The desription of suh systems is overed by the optis of thin absorbing

(cid:28)lms, a wide (cid:28)eld on whih a very rih literature exists (see e.g. the textbook

[15℄). The theoretial model merges the optial desription of an absorbing

material, through its omplex refrative index, and the optis of thin layers,

where the wave fronts of di(cid:27)erent orders of re(cid:29)etion are added oherently to

determine the resulting re(cid:29)eted wave amplitude. Assuming that the surfae

of a photoathode is su(cid:30)iently regular and uniform that the model of thin

(cid:28)lms is appliable, then the funtions A(λ, θ), R(λ, θ), T (λ, θ) are preditable,

one the three parameters of the problem are known: real and imaginary part

of the refrative index, n∗ = n + ik (i imaginary unit, both n and k funtion

of the wavelength) and thikness d of the layer. The hallenge is to invert the

results of optial measurements performed under ertain spei(cid:28) onditions

(angle of inidene, polarization, refrative index of the medium oupled to

the PMT) in order to infer the onstants n, k and d. This an be done by

(cid:28)tting the experimental results with the optial model of the photoathode,

with n, k and d as free parameters.

Unfortunately the problem has often a high degeneray: for a single mea-

surement (for example absolute re(cid:29)etane at a ertain inidene angle) there

exist in(cid:28)nite solutions for (n,k,d ) that reprodue the data. For eah onsidered

wavelength at least three independent measurements are needed, but this is

often still insu(cid:30)ient to guarantee the onvergene to a unique solution.

Several tehniques have been developed for the study of thin solid (cid:28)lms (see

[15,16℄ for a review). However, the photoathode of a PMT is a halleng-

ing sample. It annot be diretly studied, beause it is not hemially stable

6

when exposed to air. Therefore some optial observables, like re(cid:29)etane from

the photoathode side and its transmittane, annot be measured. Further-

more, polarization analysis of the light re(cid:29)eted o(cid:27) the photoathode an be

disturbed by the birefringene that is indued on the glass window by the me-

hanial stress due to the pressure di(cid:27)erene (the interior of the PMT is under

vauum). The limitations due to these experimental di(cid:30)ulties are disussed

in Ses. 3 and 5.

2.2 The Model

Dealing with light re(cid:29)etion from a PMT, four regions an be de(cid:28)ned, eah

haraterized by its own refrative index: the medium where the light orig-

inates, with n1 ; the PMT glass envelope, with n2 ; the photoathode, with

n∗
3 = nph +ikph , and the vauum inside the PMT, with n4 = 1. The amplitudes

of the re(cid:29)eted and transmitted waves at the interfae glass-photoathode (n2

to n∗

3 ) are given by the following formulas (see e.g. [17℄ for a derivation):

aR(λ, θ) = r23 + t23t32r34 exp(−2iδ)
1+r23r34 exp(−2iδ)

aT (λ, θ) = t23t34 exp(−iδ)
1+r23r34 exp(−2iδ)

where

rij =

ni cos(θi(j))−nj cos(θj(i))
ni cos(θi(j))+nj cos(θj(i))

δ = 2πdn∗

3

λ

cos (θ3)

tij =

2ni cos(θi)
ni cos(θi(j))+njcos(θj(i))

(3)

In Eq. 3, nl is the refrative index of the lth

region, θk the angle of the prop-

agating light beam with respet to the normal in the same region. This is

alulated using Snell's law starting from the angle of inidene on the PMT

window, θ1 ≡ θ. All funtions and variables in Eq. 2 and 3 are omplex and

the imaginary part of n1 , n2 and n4 is set to 0. Eq. 2 holds for both light

polarizations, perpendiular and parallel relative to the photoathode plane

(de(cid:28)ned as s and p waves, respetively), provided that the de(cid:28)nitions for rij

and tij are hanged by swapping the i and j indies as indiated in Eq. 3 (the

formulas with (cid:28)rst indies apply to the p-wave).

Eq. 2 an be used to predit the total re(cid:29)etane of the PMT by adding

the Fresnel re(cid:29)etion at the medium-to-window interfae (n1 to n2 ) to the

the identity:

(7)

2.3 Experimental Approahes

Preliminary Remarks

As a onsequene of Snell's law, the angle at whih a ray of light with a given

inidene angle emerges after rossing a series of parallel layers depends only

on the refrative index of the (cid:28)rst and last medium. If n1 ≃ 1 (PMT in air)

there is no ritial angle for total internal re(cid:29)etion. The part of the PMT

re(cid:29)etane due to the diret Fresnel ontribution of the window is trivial. In

a large region of the (n,k,d ) parameter spae the photoathode re(cid:29)etane

1

for both polarizations (given by Eqs. 4 after subtration of the window on-

tribution Fs,p) is nearly onstant for θ. 60◦

and then drops to zero (simply

beause the Fresnel re(cid:29)etion at the window rapidly inreases to 100 % for θ

approahing 90◦

, so that less light an refrat and reah the photoathode).

Therefore, re(cid:29)etane measurements in air, even at di(cid:27)erent angles, provide a

weak onstraint on the solution of the (cid:28)t, as pointed out by M&T in [8℄.

On the other hand, if n1 > 1 (for example PMT in water or sintillator),

then there is a ritial angle θc above whih no light an be transmitted.

1

Here and throughout this paper we all photoathode re(cid:29)etane the fration of

the light inident on the PMT that is re(cid:29)eted by the photoathode alone; PMT

re(cid:29)etane the fration of the light that is re(cid:29)eted by the PMT as a whole, inluding

the photoathode re(cid:29)etane and the Fresnel re(cid:29)etion at the window.

10

In this ase the photoathode re(cid:29)etane shows a plateau until θc and then a

peuliar shape, very di(cid:27)erent for parallel and perpendiular polarizations. The

optial model of the photoathode shows that, in this ase, the free parameters

(n,k,d ) are strongly onstrained by the angular dependene of the re(cid:29)etane,

in partiular by the shape around θc .

The di(cid:27)erent behavior of a PMT in air and in a n ∼ 1.5 medium is illustrated

with an example in Fig. 2.

Previous Measurements

Based on the above observations, M&T have built an experimental set-up to

measure the photoathode re(cid:29)etane as a funtion of the angle of inidene for

a PMT immersed in water, at the wavelength of λ = 442 nm, provided by a He-

Cd laser. With this tehnique they were able to establish unambiguously the

three optial onstants of the KCsSb bialkali photoathode they investigated:

n = 2.7 ± 0.1, k = 1.5 ± 0.1, d = (23 ± 2) nm [8℄. The result was obtained

by (cid:28)tting the data with the same optial model summarized in Eqs. 2 to 5.

The goodness of the best (cid:28)t was su(cid:30)ient to demonstrate that the assumed

theoretial model is an aeptable desription of the photoathode. Later on

Lang and Lay measured several PMTs equipped with the KCsSb photoathode

at the same wavelength and found that the above parameters are quite typial,

though PMT-to-PMT deviations may be larger than the statistial error [7,10℄.

This Work

Our aim was to perform a spetrosopi investigation of the optial proper-

ties of bialkali photoathodes, overing the whole visible spetrum. For this

11

purpose we used optial intrumentation designed to operate in air and our

strategy was to break the degeneray disussed earlier by making a global (cid:28)t

to a set of independent measurements. This kind of approah is quite (cid:16)stan-

dard(cid:17) in the study of thin solid (cid:28)lms, as disussed in [16℄. The optial onstants

measured at λ = 442 nm by M&T, Lang and Lay give a further ontraint to

break the residual ambiguities. For a photoathode of a PMT, light re(cid:29)eted

from the glass window side is the only aessible observable. In addition to

re(cid:29)etane determinations, we also performed el lipsometri measurements.

Ellipsometry (see [16℄) is based on the measurement of the hange in the

polarization state of light upon re(cid:29)etion o(cid:27) a plane surfae. An ellipsometer

onsists of a polarizer and an analyzer: light is linearly polarized, sent to a

sample and (cid:28)nally the re(cid:29)eted beam is analyzed. In general the re(cid:29)etion

hanges the polarization from linear to ellipti, in a way that depends on

the three optial onstants (n,k,d ). Any linear polarization an be thought

of as the superposition in phase of two orthogonal omponents. The frame

of referene is hosen relative to the sample plane, whih de(cid:28)nes the parallel

p -wave, and the perpendiular s-wave. The re(cid:29)etion o(cid:27) a surfae hanges

the relative intensity ratio between p and s waves and introdues a phase

delay. This hange an be expressed by the ratio of the omplex re(cid:29)etion

amplitudes, whih translates to an angle and a phase:

ap
R
as
R

= tan Ψei∆

(8)

where the amplitudes ap

R and as

R are given by the (cid:28)rst row of Eq. 2. The angle

Ψ and the phase ∆ are the two parameters measured by ellipsometry.

Ellipsometry is one of the most sensitive methods for the analysis of thin (cid:28)lms

12

and has the advantage over onventional re(cid:29)etometry to be independent of

absolute determinations, where systematis are di(cid:30)ult to ontrol. To our

knowledge, this tehnique has been applied here for the (cid:28)rst time to the study

of PMT photoathodes.

3 Optial Measurements of Photoathodes

PMTs from ETL (Eletron Tubes Limited) have been investigated,

9102B and 9902B, the former equipped with a blue-sensitive KCsSb bialkali

photoathode, the seond with a green-enhaned RbCsSb bialkali photoath-

ode. Both PMTs have a plano-plano window. The measurements performed

Two 1.5′′

are:

(1) Absolute re(cid:29)etane for unpolarized light at θ = 7◦

in the wavelength

range [250 nm − 700nm]

(2) Relative re(cid:29)etane for p and s polarizations at θ = 45◦, 55◦, 65◦

in the

wavelength range [400 nm − 700nm]

(3) Ellipsometri measurement of (Ψ, ∆) in the wavelength range [420 nm −

740nm]

For the ases 2 and 3, the lower limit of the probed wavelength range is the

shortest allowed by the instrument or the adopted measurement proedure, as

will be explained in the next setions. The upper limit is arbitrarily hosen,

well above the ut-o(cid:27) of the PMT sensitivity (see Fig. 1).

3.1 Absolute Re(cid:29)etane at a Fixed Angle

Experimental Tehnique

The PMT absolute re(cid:29)etane has been measured in air, at near normal in-

idene (θ = 7◦

), with a V-W aessory of a UV/Visible Varian Cary 400

spetrophotometer. The V-W tehnique (Fig. 3 and relevant aption) allows

the measurement of the absolute speular re(cid:29)etane of a (cid:29)at sample without

the use of any referene mirror. A preision of ∼ ±1 % is attainable (instru-

ment spei(cid:28)ation).

Results and Disussion

At the V-W level of auray, the (cid:29)utuations within our sample PMTs due

to inhomogeneities of the photoathode are the dominant unertainty. Conse-

quently, we report in Fig. 4 the average spetra from several measurements of

both PMTs (relative deviations of ∼ 10 % are observed).

It is remarkable that both PMTs show a ∼ 20 % re(cid:29)etane in the visible

region. The same range has also been measured by us in other bialkali PMTs

and seems to be typial of all the bialkali PMTs [10℄. Moreover, we found that

the spetral shape of the re(cid:29)etane is reprodued in other PMTs equipped

with the same kind of photoathodes.

3.2 Relative Re(cid:29)etane at Variable Angles

Experimental Tehnique

The re(cid:29)etane of the test PMTs has also been investigated with a VASRA

aessory (Variable Angle Speular Re(cid:29)etane Aessory) of our Varian Cary

400 spetrophotometer. The VASRA allows to measure the speular re(cid:29)etane

of a sample in the interval 20◦ ≤ θ ≤ 70◦

. Unlike the V-W aessory, the

VASRA has no self-referening apabilities, therefore any measurement needs

to be referened to a alibrated standard.

In order to orret for the instrument spetral baseline, we have referened the

VASRA with the response to a VM2000 [18℄ re(cid:29)etor sample, whih we have

measured to have a nearly (cid:29)at (at ∼ 1 %) re(cid:29)etane spetrum at near normal

inidene, with typial R ∼ 98 %−99 % 2

[14℄. The measurements were limited

to λ ≥ 400 nm, beause the VM2000 used as referene has re(cid:29)etane ut-o(cid:27)

at λ ∼ 390 nm. A polarizer is employed to selet the p and s waves before

re(cid:29)etion from the sample, and a depolarizer is mounted at the end of the

optial path to avoid biases related to the sensitivity of the spetrophotometer

light sensor to the polarization state of the outgoing light.

2

This implies an absolute error of . 2 %, whih is however insigni(cid:28)ant, sine

the absolute sale of the measurement will be left free (see next paragraph). The

only signi(cid:28)ant systemati error impliit in this proedure is related to the wave-

length dependene of the VM2000 re(cid:29)etane. At near-normal inidene, we found

Rmax − Rmin ≃ 2 % in the wavelength range used for the analysis [14℄. Independent

measurements at λ = 430 nm reported in the same referene give an indiation that

R & 98 % at all inidene angles.

15

Three angles of inidene are onsidered for the (cid:28)nal analysis: θ = 45◦, 55◦, 65◦

.

This angular range is hosen beause the strongest onstraints in the deter-

mination of the photoathode optial parameters are expeted from measure-

ments at high angles of inidene. Furthermore, the three seleted angles are

around the Brewster's angle for Fresnel re(cid:29)etion o(cid:27) the glass, so that the

PMT re(cid:29)etane of the parallel polarization is largely dominated by the pho-

toathode ontribution.

Results and Disussion

Fig. 5 displays the average re(cid:29)etane spetra, where the mean values of a set of

≥ 4 repeated sans are shown. We found that the shape of the urves are very

reproduible, however the absolute sale of the measurement is not (relative

deviations of up to ∼ 20 % are observed). The reason is that the alignment of

the VASRA sample holder an hange slightly for di(cid:27)erent sans, resulting in

a variation of the olletion e(cid:30)ieny for the re(cid:29)eted light. For this reason,

the VASRA measurement will be used for spetral shape data only, while the

absolute normalization of all urves is onsidered as a free parameter of the

(cid:28)t funtion (to be disussed in Se. 4).

3.3 El lipsometri Measurements

Experimental Tehnique

The ellipsometri measurements have been performed with a M-44 Vis J.A.

Wool lam spetral ellipsometer. The instrument allows the simultaneous mea-

surement of 44 disrete wavelengths in the range [419 nm−742 nm]. The angle

16

of inidene on the sample was θ = 60.75◦ ± 0.01◦

, measured by ellipsometry

itself on a referene SiO2 (cid:28)lm. Light was linearly polarized and the polariza-

tion state of light upon re(cid:29)etion was analyzed by deomposing the elliptial

polarization into the parameters Ψ and ∆ of Eq. 8. The thikness of the PMT

glass window was su(cid:30)ient to allow a lear separation of the beams re(cid:29)eted

o(cid:27) the glass and the photoathode, so that it was possible to selet only the

latter light to the analyzer. This seletion failitates the sueeding interpre-

tation of data. For both PMTs three ellipsometri sans have been performed,

orresponding to the illumination of di(cid:27)erent spots of the photoathode.

Results and Disussion

The results are shown in Fig. 6. It an be seen that for the PMT ETL 9102B

the three sans of the Ψ(λ) funtion are in exellent agreement with eah

other, while the ∆(λ) spetra measured in di(cid:27)erent positions are similar, but

shifted by nearly onstant phases. This is likely to be an artifat introdued

by stress-birefringene of the PMT glass window. This stress is di(cid:27)erent in

di(cid:27)erent positions, and this an explain the observed phase shifts in the three

measurements of ∆(λ). Di(cid:27)erenes are also observed in the Ψ(λ) sans of

the ETL 9902B PMT. It is likely that this e(cid:27)et is due to a inhomogeneous

photoathode thikness

.

3

The proess of photoathode growth through evaporation an lead to some in-

homogeneities in the layer thikness. This is for example observed and studied in

3

[7,10℄.

17

4 Data Analysis

In Se. 2.1 the equations desribing the optial model of a thin absorbing (cid:28)lm

have been introdued and in Se. 3 all the optial measurements performed

on two sample PMTs have been reported. The purpose of data analysis is

to ombine theory and experiments to derive the unknowns of the problems.

Those unknowns are:

(1) The photoathode refrative index, n∗(λ) = n(λ) + ik(λ)

(2) The photoathode thikness, d

For simpliity, it will be assumed that the glass refrative index is a known

funtion:

nglass = 1.472 + 3760/λ2

(9)

Eq. 9 is the Cauhy dispersion law with the typial parameters of the borosil-

iate glass employed for the PMT envelope

.

4

We have written a omputer program implementing Eqs. 2 to 5, whih is

used to perform a global (cid:28)t to the experimental data based on a least square

minimization. The program uses the pakage MINUIT of the CERN software

libraries to perform suh minimization. The global parameter d is easily imple-

mented, while real and imaginary part of the photoathode refrative index are

4

The refrative index of the borosiliate glass is measured by many manufaturers

to be in the range 1.48 . n . 1.50 in the visible spetrum. Eq. 9 gives n(380 nm) ≃

1.50, n(680 nm) ≃ 1.48 and n(442 nm) ≃ 1.49. The latter value has been diretly

measured by M&T [8℄. It has been also veri(cid:28)ed that (cid:28)xing nglass = c, where  is any

onstant in the above range, leads to similar results in the analysis.

18

ontinuous funtions of the wavelength. They are implemented in the global (cid:28)t

as a table of parameters at disrete wavelengths, from 380 nm to 680 nm with

steps of 15 nm, and then interpolated at eah data-point wavelength by using

a ubi spline funtion. As mentioned in Se. 3, some of our measurements

su(cid:27)er from systematis implying a partial loss of information. This fores the

introdution of new free parameters in the (cid:28)t:

(1) Six normalization fators for the VASRA re(cid:29)etane measurements, ex-

pressing the systemati unertainty in the absolute sale of the sans

(2) One onstant phase-shift for the average ∆ ellipsometri spetrum, a-

ounting for the e(cid:27)et of the glass birefringene

The (cid:28)t is performed in the wavelength range [380 nm, 680 nm] 5

.

The funtion FCN minimized by MINUIT is expressed as the sum of 4 on-

tributions: F CN = F CNV −W + F CNV ASRA + F CNΨ + F CN∆ . Eah one,

F CNl , is de(cid:28)ned as:

F CNl(pj) =

[yli − ml(λi, pj)]2

1
n

n

X
i=1

(10)

where yli is the value of the lth

optial measurement at the wavelength λi and

ml(λi, pj) is the predition of the theoretial model, for a partiular hoie

of the parameters set {pj}. Eq. 10 is normalized to the total number of data-

points n to have eah measurement ontribute the same statistial weight in

the global (cid:28)t.

5

In the

interval

In

[380 nm, 400 nm] only the V-W data is available.

[400 nm, 420 nm] V-W plus VASRA. Above 420 nm the full data-set. The degen-

eray in the [380 nm, 400 nm] interval is broken by requiring the ontinuity of the

optial funtions (the photoathode thikness is ommon to all wavelengths).

5 Results

5.1 Preliminary Remarks and Analysis Strategy

The inversion of our experimental data by using the desribed (cid:28)tting proedure

does not lead to a unique solution. We (cid:28)nd that our measurements are su(cid:30)-

ient to onstrain the spetral shape of the optial onstants, however there

are strong orrelations in the (cid:28)t between n, k and d, so that the FCN funtion

does not show a well de(cid:28)ned minimum. The reason is that our measurements

are not really (cid:16)orthogonal(cid:17) and beause of the systematis disussed in Se.

3, the VASRA and ellipsometri data provide only partial information. Fur-

thermore, measurements in air give weaker onstraints than measurements in

higher refrative index media, as the model is highly degenerate in the optial

parameters for this ase (see Se. 2.3).

The values of the photoathode omplex refrative index measured by M&T,

Lang and Lay at λ = 442 nm provide the missing onstraint to break the resid-

ual degeneray at all wavelengths. In fat, solutions an be found onsistent

with those previous determinations, however provided that the ellipsometri

Ψ(λ) data are orreted by introduing a free angular shift. Sine the physial

meaning of suh a parameter is less lear than for the ase of the expeted

phase-shift of the ∆(λ) funtion, in this paper we present an analysis of our

data in whih Ψ(λ) is not inluded in the global (cid:28)t. The onsisteny of the

Ψ(λ) spetrum with the other data and the optial model is disussed in the

next setion.

The analysis for the KCsSb photoathode is arried out by requiring the solu-

20

tion to be onsistent with the optial onstants measured by M&T at 442 nm,

and later on(cid:28)rmed by Lang and Lay. This means that we (cid:28)x n = 2.7 ± 0.2,

k = 1.5 ± 0.2 at λ = 440 nm (the losest wavelength to 442 nm in our parame-

ters table). The only published measurements on RbCsSb photoathodes using

the M&T tehnique are reported in [10℄. A large satter is observed, however

the two samples manufatured by ETL and expeted to be very similar to our

ETL 9902B give onsistent results. We therefore (cid:28)x the optial onstants at

λ = 440 nm to the average value of these PMTs: n = 2.5 ± 0.2, k = 1.35 ± 0.1.

For either photoathode the quoted errors are ∼ ±2σ .

Fixing the optial onstants at the given wavelength in the global (cid:28)t (where the

Ψ(λ) san is exluded) breaks the degeneray and leads to unique solutions for

the photoathode thikness d and the spetra n(λ) and k(λ). The unertainty

assoiated with the error of the optial parameters at 440 nm is aounted

for by alulating an (cid:16)upper(cid:17) solution with (cid:28)xed (n, k)KCsSb = (2.9, 1.7) and

(n, k)RbCsSb = (2.7, 1.45), and a (cid:16)lower(cid:17) solution for (n, k) = (2.5, 1.3)KCsSb

and (n, k)RbCsSb = (2.3, 1.25). The band between these two solutions de(cid:28)nes

our 2σ on(cid:28)dene interval for real and imaginary part of the omplex refrative

index at all wavelengths, and as well for the photoathode thikness. This

hoie of estimating the errors is justi(cid:28)ed by the fat that in M&T's and Lang's

(cid:28)t to data, as well as in ours, n and k are strongly orrelated. We estimate that

the additional unertainty oming from the (cid:28)t of our data is small ompared

to the one assoiated with the error of the (cid:28)xed optial parameters.

21

5.2 KCsSb Bialkali Photoathode

An example of global (cid:28)t to the optial measurements performed on the PMT

ETL 9102B is shown in Figs. 7 and 8, while Fig. 9 shows the best (cid:28)t solutions

for the omplex refrative index and the 2σ allowed bands. In Table 1 the

other parameters of the (cid:28)t are reported.

Fig. 8 also shows the predition of the best (cid:28)t model for the Ψ(λ) ellipsometri

funtion, not used for the global (cid:28)t. It is remarkable that the predited spetral

shape is in exellent agreement with the measurement. Data and model simply

di(cid:27)er by a onstant angular shift, whih is probably due to an unimplemented

systemati e(cid:27)et related to the glass birefringene. An additional free o(cid:27)set

might be introdued to inlude the Ψ(λ) data in the global (cid:28)t. However the

(cid:28)gure shows that this information would simply be redundant.

The results in Fig. 9 show that the spetral shape of the real and imaginary

part of the photoathode refrative index is well onstrained by the data, while

the absolute sale depends on the assumptions of the optial onstants (cid:28)xed

during the (cid:28)t. Both n and k anti-orrelate with the photoathode thikness

(Table 1), as was observed also by M&T in their analysis.

Fig. 9 also shows a graphial omparison of our results with those of M&T,

inluding a re-analysis that M&T propose of previous measurements by Timan

at disrete wavelengths in the visible region [8,9℄. Our results are in good

agreement with M&T's analysis of Timan, both for the real and imaginary

part of the omplex refrative index.

The estimation of the photoathode thikness (Table 1) is onsistent with

22

the typial values found by M&T, Lang and Lay, and expeted by the PMT

manufaturer.

5.3 RbCsSb Bialkali Photoathode

We have arried out a similar analysis for the optial measurements on the

PMT ETL 9902B (RbCsSb bialkali). The estimated real and omplex part of

the refrative index as a funtion of the wavelength are plotted in Fig. 10.

The solutions show similar features to the ase of the KCsSb : the spetral

shapes are well onstrained by data and shifting the values at 440 nm (cid:28)xed

during the (cid:28)t produes a orresponding shift of the entire spetra, whih is

ompensated by an anti-orrelated hange in the photoathode thikness (Ta-

ble 2).

6 Disussion and Appliations

In the previous setion it has been shown that our measurements, in onjun-

tion with M&T's (KCsSb ) and Lang's (RbCsSb ) at λ = 442 nm, lead to unique

solutions for the optial onstants of the investigated photoathodes in the full

visible range. In the following setions we report the optial performanes of

bialkali PMTs predited by our model for some spei(cid:28) ases. We also try to

probe the degree of preditability of our model and to evaluate the unertain-

ties originating from the ambiguity left in the problem. In all the alulations

it will be assumed that light impinging on the PMT is unpolarized.

It should be noted that even with a preise determination of the photoathode

23

optial parameters in one PMT, the problem of prediting the behavior of any

other similar PMT would still remain to some extent indeterminate, beause

the thikness of the photoathode an vary up to a fator ∼ 2 from one PMT

to another, as shown by Lang. Therefore we point out that the preditions

and relevant unertainties presented in the next setions refer spei(cid:28)ally to

the two measured sample PMTs. The model an be extended to any generi

KCsSb and RbCsSb PMT, however with a somewhat larger unertainty. We

do not disuss here the e(cid:27)et of the dependene of the PMT optial properties

on the photoathode thikness. This issue is examined in [8,7℄.

Several ases may be onsidered as for the oupling of the PMT to the medium

where the light originates. We will fous on the ase of a KCsSb PMT optially

oupled to a sintillator. For simpliity, it will be assumed nmedium = 1.48 at

all wavelength, so that the medium refrative index is slightly lower than that

of the PMT window glass at all wavelengths in the visible.

6.1 Wavelength Dependene of the Re(cid:29)etane

Fig. 11 reports the wavelength dependene of the PMT re(cid:29)etane at various

angles, alulated for our sample ETL 9102B in (or oupled to) a medium

with n = 1.48.

At near normal inidene the spetrum is very similar to the one measured in

air (f. Fig. 3) and does not hange muh until θ approahes θc (≃ 42◦). Above

the ritial angle the spetrum behaves di(cid:27)erently, with higher re(cid:29)etane at

longer wavelengths: sine transmission is suppressed for θ > θc and absorption

dereases with λ (to disuss in Se. 6.4, f. Fig. 16), the re(cid:29)etane must

24

neessarily ompensate, to preserve A + R + T = 1.

The preditions for the RbCsSb photoathode are qualitatively very similar.

The only visible di(cid:27)erene is that the main features of the spetra (peaks

below θc , slope hange above) appear ∼ 40 nm shifted to longer wavelengths,

oherently with all the optial measurements.

In Fig. 12 it is shown how the indetermination in our model a(cid:27)ets the pre-

ditions: for θ < θc all the solutions in the allowed bands give nearly the same

results, whereas at higher angles some di(cid:27)erenes are observed. This is related

to the fat that the optis of a PMT in liquid below the ritial angle does

not di(cid:27)er very muh from that of a PMT in air (after taking into aount the

Fresnel re(cid:29)etion from the glass). The seleted solutions are those that (cid:28)t best

the measurements in air, onsequently they also make very similar preditions

for a PMT in liquid at θ < θc . On the other hand, also above the ritial angle

the di(cid:27)erene in the preditions of the allowed solutions is < 10 %.

6.2 Angular Dependene of Re(cid:29)etane and Absorption

In Fig. 13 the angular dependene of the PMT re(cid:29)etane and e(cid:27)etive absorp-

tion

is shown for 4 representative wavelengths. In all ases the re(cid:29)etane

6

6

The e(cid:27)etive absorption inludes also the fration of transmitted light that is bak

re(cid:29)eted onto the photoathode by the aluminized internal surfae of the PMT, and

is eventually absorbed. For simpliity we do not simulate the optis inside the PMT

and assume that on average a fration ∼ 0.7 of the transmitted light (T ) hits the

photoathode again. The probability for absorption is given by the same optial

model desribed in Se. 2.1, simply by exhanging the order of the refrative indies,

going from vauum to sintillator. Absorption from the photoathode side is a very

25

has a plateau below θc , then a sharp peak at the ritial angle, followed by

an extended angular region where R has similar or higher values than at near

normal inidene; last R has a fast inrease to 100 % for θ → 90◦

. Similarly

the e(cid:27)etive absorption has a (cid:29)at angular dependene for θ < θc , a dip at

the ritial angle, followed by a broad peak and it then drops to zero, sine

A + R = 100 % (T = 0 for θ > θc ). At di(cid:27)erent wavelengths the branhing

between re(cid:29)etion and absorption hanges, as well as the shape of the peak

around the ritial angle.

In Fig. 14 the impat on R(θ) of the unertainty of the optial parameters

is studied, for the PMT ETL 9102B at λ = 425 nm. It is again found that

all the allowed solutions give the same preditions for θ < θc , whereas they

di(cid:27)er slightly from eah other at larger angles of inidene. The strongest

departures (. 20 %) are observed in a narrow angular range around θc and

for 65◦ . θ . 80◦

.

The analysis of the RbCsSb photoathode leads to very similar preditions. In

ase nmedium > nglas the same qualitative features are observed, however, the

re(cid:29)etane (absorption) goes to 100 % (0 %) below 90◦

, orresponding to the

ondition for total internal re(cid:29)etion at the medium-glass interfae.

(cid:29)at funtion of θ . Using the entral solution model for the PMT ETL 9102B, we (cid:28)nd:

A(410 nm) ∼ 0.44, A(440 nm) ∼ 0.41, A(500 nm) ∼ 0.35, A(560 nm) ∼ 0.22. These

values are multiplied by 0.7T and added to the absorption from the sintillator side

to obtain the e(cid:27)etive absorption funtion. The e(cid:27)et of this orretion is to inrease

absorption below the ritial angle, resulting in a higher QE. As a by-produt, the

PMT e(cid:30)ieny has a more uniform angular dependene.

6.3 Angular Dependene of the Quantum E(cid:30)ieny

Assuming that the onversion fator Pconv(λ) in Eq. 1 does not depend on

θ (see [7℄), the angular dependene of the PMT QE is the same as that of

the e(cid:27)etive absorption. As a onsequene, the e(cid:30)ieny of a PMT an be

predited for any θ and λ by resaling the alulated e(cid:27)etive absorption at

θ with Pconv(λ), given by the ratio QE(λ)/A(λ) at near-normal inidene. As

an example, in Fig. 15 the predited QE(θ) is plotted, for the ETL 9102B in

sintillator and air, at the wavelength of 410 nm. The urves are alulated by

resaling the e(cid:27)etive absorption in suh a way that the QE in air at normal

inidene is 27 %. It is observed that both urves have a plateau, extending up

to θ ≃ 40◦

in sintillator and θ ≃ 50◦

in air. The QE in liquid is expeted to be

slightly higher than in air, beause of the Fresnel re(cid:29)etion at the window. As

in Fig. 13, PMTs in liquids have a peak sensitivity in the range 45◦ . θ . 75◦

.

On the other hand, PMTs in air lose sensitivity above ∼ 50◦

, beause the

Fresnel re(cid:29)etion from the glass window inreases.

6.4 Qualitative Understanding of the PMT Sensitivity

In this setion we show that the model is also able to explain qualitative fea-

tures of the wavelength dependene of the PMT QE. The latter is related

to the photoathode absorption

, as expressed in Eq. 1. Fig. 16 shows the

7

wavelength dependene of the absorption, dedued from our model (entral

solutions) for PMTs in air at near normal inidene. The (cid:28)gure shows that

For this qualitative disussion we use the simple absorption, instead of the e(cid:27)etive

7

absorption.

27

the green-enhaned bialkali photoathode has a plateau of maximum absorp-

tion extending further into the (cid:16)green(cid:17) visible region, ompared to the blue-

sensitive bialkali. Absorption is largely determined by the imaginary part of

the refrative index, so that the features of the alulated spetra re(cid:29)et the

shape of the k(λ) funtions in Figs. 9 and 10. There it is also found that the

imaginary part of the RbCsSb refretive index peaks at longer wavelengths

ompared to KCsSb.

We note that the orret predition of the sensitivity of the two photoathodes,

though only qualitative, is non trivial, beause it is based exlusively on the

study of the re(cid:29)eted light. However, the alulated absorption spetra are in

disagreement with the reported QE (see Fig. 1), espeially in the tail, where

the QE drops to zero, while the model predits only a fator of ∼ 3 redution.

This may be explained by postulating that the onversion fator Pconv(λ) in

Eq. 1 vanishes at long wavelengths: photoeletrons are indeed produed, but

with insu(cid:30)ient kineti energy to esape the photoathode. Lay also omes to

the same onlusion in [7℄.

7 Conlusions

We have investigated the optial properties in the visible range of two test ETL

PMTs, 9102B and 9902B, equipped with a (cid:16)blue-sensitive(cid:17) KCsSb and a (cid:16)green-

enhaned(cid:17) RbCsSb bialkali photoathode, respetively. This study inludes

the spetrosopi measurement of the absolute re(cid:29)etane at near normal ini-

dene, of the polarization-dependent relative re(cid:29)etane at variable angles, and

of the hange in the light polarization upon re(cid:29)etion o(cid:27) the photoathode.

We have (cid:28)tted the experimental data with a model based on the optis of thin

28

(cid:28)lms to determine the photoathode thikness and its wavelength-dependent

omplex refrative index. Degenerate solutions appeared, however the (cid:28)t on-

verges to a unique solution one the omplex refrative index of the photo-

athode is (cid:28)xed at a single wavelength, for example to the value determined by

other authors at λ = 442 nm. Based on this observation, we ould predit the

optial properties of both PMTs in the wavelength region [380 nm, 680 nm],

and for any angle of inidene and oupling. As an example, we have studied

in detail the ase of a KCsSb PMT oupled to a sintillator. The model pre-

dits that the re(cid:29)etane as a funtion of the angle of inidene on the PMT is

nearly onstant for 0◦ < θ . 40◦

, with values of R ∼ 15 % − 25 %, depending

on the wavelength. It was shown that in this angular range the preditions of

the model are very robust, sine they are strongly onstrained by the diret

measurement of the PMT re(cid:29)etane. Above the ritial angle (θ & 42◦

) the

degeneray is broken and the unertainty of the model is larger. However, also

in this ase quantitative preditions are made, at the level of . 10 % preision

(2σ). As another appliation of this study, through the alulated angular de-

pendene of the photoathode absorption, the quantum e(cid:30)ieny of a PMT,

normally measured in air for near-normal illumination, an be predited for

any angle and oupling. For the ase of PMT in sintillator, we found that

the PMT has nearly onstant sensitivity for θ < θc , a ∼ 20 % higher e(cid:30)ieny

for 45◦ . θ . 75◦

and a vanishing e(cid:30)ieny for θ → 90◦

, where the PMT

re(cid:29)etane goes to 100 %. The sensitivity of a PMT in air is expeted to have

a plateau for θ . 50◦

and then to derease monotonially down to 0 % for

θ → 90◦

, due to the Fresnel re(cid:29)etion at the glass window.

The desription of light interation with the bialkali PMTs reported in this

paper overs most of the experimental onditions in whih these devies are

29

used. Therefore this model is suitable for implementation in photon-traing

Monte Carlo odes, through the formulas 2 - 7, the input optial parameters

n(λ), k(λ) shown in Figs. 9, 10 and listed in Appendix A, and the typial

photoathode thikness reported in Tables 1 and 2.

on(cid:28)guration (IS ) is ompared to the one measured in the (cid:16)Referene(cid:17) on(cid:28)guration

(IR ). The mirrors M1 and M2 are in a (cid:28)xed position, while the mirror M3 an be

moved as shown on the right side of the (cid:28)gure. The sample to measure is loated

exatly half way between the two slots for M3. The optial length is the same in the

two on(cid:28)gurations, as well as the re(cid:29)etane at the mirrors M1, M2 and M3. The

only di(cid:27)erene is that light in the right side on(cid:28)guration must re(cid:29)et twie on the

We report in the following table the best (cid:28)t refrative indies for the two

photoathodes, from 380 nm to 680 nm in 15 nm steps, as implemented in

the minimization ode. The entral solutions are shown, whih orrespond to

a (cid:28)xed n = 2.70 and k = 1.50 for the KCsSb photoathode, and n = 2.50

and k = 1.35 for RbCsSb. The relevant best (cid:28)t thiknesses are 20.0 nm and

23.4 nm, for the KCsSb and RbCsSb photoathode, respetively.

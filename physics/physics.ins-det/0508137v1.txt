Abstract

The Laser-wire will be an essential diagnostic tool at the
International Linear Collider. It uses a ﬁnely focussed laser
beam to measure the transverse proﬁle of electron bunches
by detecting the Compton-scattered photons (or degraded
electrons) downstream of where the laser beam intersects
the electron beam. Such a system has been installed at the
PETRA storage ring at DESY, which uses a piezo-driven
mirror to scan the laser-light across the electron beam. Lat-
est results of experimental data taking are presented and
compared to detailed simulations using the Geant4 based
program BDSIM.

INTRODUCTION

The International Linear Collider (ILC) will be a TeV-
scale lepton collider that will require non-invasive beam
size monitors with micron and sub-micron resolution for
beam phase space optimisation [1]. Laser-wire monitors
operate by focussing a laser to a small spot size that can
be scanned across the electron beam, producing Compton-
scattered photons (and degraded electrons). These photons
can then be detected further downstream using the total en-
ergy observed as a function of the laser spot position to in-
fer the transverse proﬁle of the electron bunch. The Laser-
wire system installed in the PETRA ring is part of an ongo-
ing effort in the R&D of producing a feasible non-invasive
beam size diagnostic tool.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The PETRA accelerator was chosen for the installation
of the Laser-wire experiment because it is capable of pro-
ducing bunch patterns similar to the ILC. Laser-wire tests
are run using a 7 GeV positron beam with a single bunch
with a charge of typically 7.7 nC. From the optics lattice
the average beam size is σx = 268 µm for the horizontal
and σy = 68 µm for the vertical dimension.
Preliminary simulations showed that

the Compton-
scattered photons loose the majority of their energy in the
material of the dipole magnet’s beampipe due to hitting the
wall with a shallow angle, resulting in an effective length

Laser Beam

The laser pulses are created in a Q-switched Nd:YAG
laser operating at 532 nm. The pulses are then transported
via a matched Gaussian relay made up of two lenses over
a distance of 20 m from the laser hut via an access pipe
into the tunnel housing the accelerator. The laser beam is
then reﬂected off the scanning mirror before it reaches a
focusing lens with f = 117 mm back-focal length. The
scanner is a piezo-driven platform with an attached high-
reﬂectivity mirror which has a maximum scan range of
2.5 mrad. The peak power at the laser exit was mea-
±
sured to be 3.63 MW. At the IP the peak power is reduced
to 1.46 MW as higher order modes carry some fraction of
the beam power but these are focussed out of beam trans-
port, which is only matched for the fundamental mode. The
longitudinal proﬁle was measured using a streak camera
with 5 ps time resolution. The data revealed a pulse length
of ∆t = 12.5 ns FWHM with a sub-structure of roughly
70 ps peak-to-peak and 70 ps peak width at full contrast
due to mode-beating. This causes the Compton signal am-
plitude to vary between zero and full signal for different
laser shots. In order to reduce the data taking time the cur-
rent laser will be replaced with an injection seeded system
enabling faster data taking.

The Laser-wire set up makes use of a calorimeter com-
posed of 9 Lead Tungstate (P bW O4) crystals arranged in
a 3
3 matrix ﬁxed with optical grease to a square faced
photomultiplier. The individual crystals have dimensions
of 18
150 mm. The complete detector set up was
tested with a testbeam from the DESY II accelerator using
electrons from 450 MeV to 6 GeV. Energy resolution was
shown to be better than 6% for individual crystals and 10%
for the overall set up. Simulations show that for the 3
3
matrix, 95% of the total energy deposit is collected for an
incoming Compton-scattered photon with 300 MeV energy
[2].

Data Acquisition

The Laser-wire DAQ system has two main components:
the hardware trigger which synchronises the laser and DAQ
components to the electron (positron) bunch, and the soft-
ware which controls the acquisition and collation of data
from each sub-component of the system.

The hardware trigger operates with two inputs from the
PETRA Integrated Timing system (PIT) and produces the
necessary signals to ﬁre the laser. The trigger card also
produces a signal to trigger the CCD cameras and a sig-
nal to start the software data acquisition. When the signal
from the trigger card is received a counter which runs for
approximately 420 µs is started. After this time a signal
is sent to the integrator card, lasting around 50 µs, to inte-
grate the output from the calorimeter. The integrated signal
is read by an ADC channel.

The DAQ software also produces a programmable sig-
nal, up to a peak of 10 V, which is ampliﬁed by a factor
of 10 and this is used to drive the piezo-electric scanner.
A scaled version of the scanner ampliﬁer output is read by
an ADC channel. The other sub-components of the DAQ
system: the BPM monitor, the PETRA data monitor and
the CCD cameras are also read out. Communication with
each component is performed by a messaging system using
TCP/IP.

DATA ANALYSIS

Laser Beam Size

In order to determine the transverse size of the electron
beam, it is necessary to know the properties of the laser that
is being used to scan. Particular attention is paid to the spot
size at the laser waist, σ0, and the Rayleigh range, zR, (the
distance from the waist at which the beam size σ = √2σ0).
These properties are related by Eq. 1:

The laser is focused using the same ﬁnal focus lens as
described previously. A CMOS camera is placed on a track
rail so that it can be moved through the focal plane parallel
to the beam direction. Due to the high power of the laser,
the beam was ﬁrst passed through a 99.9 % reﬂective mir-
ror, and then through a variable amount of neutral density
ﬁlter in order to prevent saturation and damage to the cam-
era pixels. The camera was moved along the track rail to
a number of positions, and 100 images were taken in each
location.

The images taken by the camera are stored as 8-bit
greyscale bitmap ﬁles. The pixel data is projected onto the
y-axis, and ﬁtted to a gaussian on a linear background in
the region around the signal peak. The width at each loca-
tion is then plotted, and ﬁtted to Eq. 1. From this we obtain
M 2 = 7.6
0.41, which is within the expected range, and

Scan Data

±

The laser is scanned across the electron beam by tilting
a mirror on a piezo-electric stack to produce a deﬂection
2.5 mrad. Focusing through the lens produces a travel
of
range for the focal spot at the IP of 585 µm. The scanner
voltage is applied in a stepped sinusoidal pattern; 10 trig-
gers are taken at each of 100 voltages over a whole 2π. The
trigger signal is taken from the laser trigger card running at
30 Hz, so a full scan takes approximately 33 s.

The signal from the ADC is expected to display two
peaks; one as the laser crosses the electron beam on a ris-
ing voltage to the scanner, and one on a falling voltage.
The trigger number exactly half way between the peaks
should correspond to a turning point in the scanner posi-
tion. The mean of the background subracted ADC counts
at each voltage is then ﬁtted to a gaussian whose width,
e + σ2
σm is given by σ2
0. Fig. 3 shows the typical
results observed for a single scan and the results of multi-
scan shifts are presented in Table 1. Note that the large
signal variation in Fig. 3a is partly due to the sub-structure
of each laser pulse and will be removed by a better laser.

Figure 4: Calorimeter energy spectra for data and simu-
lated events.

The experimental data show an energy resolution of 34%
which is dominated by the longitudinal ﬂuctuations in the
laser power. The simulation models these ﬂuctuations us-
ing relatively old streak camera data as described above and
so does not account for degradation in the quality of the
laser since then. The calorimeter has also not been cali-
brated for the range of energy deposits now incident upon
it and has been in the PETRA radiation environment for
three years. This could explain why the simulation fails to
completely model the experimental data in the lower en-
ergy region.

OUTLOOK

The future strategy for the Laser-wire project can be
characterised in the short term to concentrate on non-laser
issues like data acquisition, signal detection, vertical scan-
ning, and implementation into a linac beamline. This aims
at the development of a standard diagnostic tool to be
placed at many locations along the accelerator beamline. In
the long run R&D work is planned to develop a laser sys-
tem producing pulses matching the ILC micro pulse struc-
ture. Here the target is to have a beamsize monitor with
full ﬂexibilty. To meet the short-term targets it is planned
to purchase an injection seeded Q-switch laser with sec-
ond harmonic generation having excellent longitudinal and
transverse mode quality. A complimentary project concen-
trating on the achievement of micron-scale laser spot-sizes
is underway at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK.

COMPARISON WITH SIMULATIONS

The entire PETRA Laser-wire set up has been simulated
using BDSIM [3], which is a fast tracking code utilising the
Geant4 [4] physics processes and framework. The simula-
tion is a full model of the accelerator components includ-
ing beampipe, magnets, and cooling water channel. For
each simulated event a Compton scattered photon is gen-
erated with an energy based upon the Compton Spectrum
predicted for the PETRA Laser-wire parameters. This pho-
ton is tracked to the detector whilst fully simulating any
interactions with materials such as the beampipe wall. This
process is repeated to create an effective single Compton
energy distribution and its corresponding distribution at the
detector after passing through any matter along the photon
path.

The single photon distribution in the detector is ex-
trapolated to the Nphoton spectrum using Poisson statis-
tics whilst also accounting for the energy resolution of the
calorimeter and the longitudinal sub-structure of a typi-
cal laser pulse. The simulated spectrum is compared di-
rectly to the experimental data (see Fig. 4), where the laser
and electron beam were well aligned. The expected num-
ber of Compton-scattered photons, Nphoton, per shot with
the Laser-wire setup parameters is approximately 170
25
photons, which agrees with the theoretical value.

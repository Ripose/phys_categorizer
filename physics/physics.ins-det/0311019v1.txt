Abstract

A prototype detector for Compton camera imaging is under development. A mono-
lithic array of 19 channel Silicon drift detector with on-chip electronics is going to
be used as a scatter detector for the prototype system. Custom designed analog and
digital readout electronics for this detector was ﬁrst tested by using a single cell
Silicon drift detector. This paper describes the readout architecture and presents
the results of the measurement.

been produced. The prototype system under development which is discussed
here [5] is going to be used for studying the application in medical imaging.

The principal idea of the Compton camera is to replace the mechanical colli-
mator of an Anger camera with an electronic collimator. The Compton cam-
era consists of two detector components: the so called scatter detector and
the absorption detector. A photon emitted from a source undergoes Compton
scattering at the scatter detector where the recoil electron is absorbed and its
energy and the location of interaction are determined. The scattered photon
leaves the scatter detector and is absorbed in the second detector where the
energy and impact position are determined. From this information the source
of the incident photon is found to be on the surface of a cone; the so called
backprojected cone.

Silicon was found to be the best material for the scatter detector [6] considering
its high Compton to total interaction ratio at the gamma energy of interest
(several hundred keV). The prototype will consist of a Silicon Drift Detector
(SDD)[7] as the scatter detector and an Anger camera without lead collimator
as the absorption detector. The Silicon detector is a monolithic array of 19
cells with an on-chip JFET for the ﬁrst ampliﬁcation in every cell. It has been
produced by the Max Planck Institute semiconductor laboratory (MPI/HLL).
This paper presents the fast frontend and readout electronics designed for this
detector and the test results which were obtained with a single cell detector
of the same type.

2 Setup Overview

The single cell detector has an area of 5 mm2 and it has a circular shape.
The thickness of the wafer is 300 µm. The mounting of the detector on a ce-
ramic support and the bonding were done at MPI/HLL. The detector leakage
current was around 100 pA. The operational principle of this detector has
been explained in several publications elsewhere [8]. The most signiﬁcant fea-
ture of this detector is the on-chip integrated JFET which serves to reduce
the stray capacitance and therefore provides a better noise performance com-
pared to other Silicon detectors. This detector type has been used for several
applications such as a scintillator based gamma-camera [9], holography [10],
and spectrometry [11]. Our prototype Compton camera will exploit the new
possible application ﬁeld for it.

2.1 Readout Architecture

The standard readout architecture for the SDD consists of a source follower
with a source load of a constant current supply and the detector signal is
ampliﬁed at a voltage-sensitive preampliﬁer, and then further ﬁltered with a
shaper. The transconductance (gm) of an n channel on-chip JFET is about 0.3
mS and the time constant τ = 1
· Ctotal produces a rise time of 2.2 · τ which
gm
is of the order of 300 ns. For the Compton camera application it is important
to have fast trigger signals from the ﬁrst detector. This can be done by a
readout of the back side of the detector which is under research at MPI.
Our implementation of the readout architecture is shown in Fig 1. Emitter
followers were used for gas proportional counters as low noise preampliﬁers
[12]. In addition to the source-follower at the SDD chip, an emitter follower
provided certain advantages. First of all, the signal after the emitter-follower
stage becomes more immune to additional stray capacitances. The readout
electronics can be placed further away from the detector, provided that the
emitter-follower is as near as possible to the detector. Furthermore, the rise
time of the preampliﬁed signal decreases considerably, which makes the use of
a short shaping time (<100 ns) possible. The driver transistor for the emitter
follower was chosen to be a bipolar junction transistor. The selection of this
transistor is based on a dynamic range, a noise contribution and an input
capacitance. Fig 2 shows the preampliﬁer output with and without emitter
follower between the detector and the preampliﬁer. The detector was irradiated
by a 55Fe source. The rise time of the signal reduces almost by a factor of 5
with the emitter follower.

follower stage

2.2 Preampliﬁer

The preampliﬁer is a modiﬁed version of a preampliﬁer which was used for
one of the ﬁrst prototype SDDs [13]. The gain of the preampliﬁer is approxi-
mately the ratio between the injection capacitor at the input and the feedback
capacitor. The voltage step at the output of the preampliﬁer decays with a
time constant of Rf · Cf = 100µs.

10 channels of the preampliﬁer have been implemented on a hybrid board

by using a thick ﬁlm technology. (ﬁg 3). The power consumption per chan-
nel is around 130mW according to the SPICE simulations. The deviation
from linearity of the preampliﬁer for one channel is shown in Fig 4a. The
measurement was done by applying a voltage step at the input of the pream-
pliﬁer and measuring the output of it. The average voltage gain is around 15.
In Fig 4b the equivalent noise charge (ENC) of the preampliﬁer as a func-
tion of a shaping time is shown.The preampliﬁer output was connected to a
spectroscopy ampliﬁer (model 1413) for performing the noise measurements.
The ENC was calculated for an input capacitance of 1 pF. The peak noise
voltage of the preampliﬁer/shaper system was measured with an analog os-
cilloscope recording the peak-to-peak amplitude at a very low trigger rate (≤
100Hz) and this level corresponds to four to ﬁve standard deviations. The re-

4

sults obtained by this method were also conﬁrmed with a digital oscilloscope’s
(LeCroy 9362) standard deviation measurement. The ENC values are given
in rms electron/pF units which translate into 2-4 rms electrons for 300 fF of
detector capacitance. So, the noise contribution of this low noise preampliﬁer
to the whole detector and readout system is expected to be very small.

2.3 Shaper

An in house developed hybrid shaper was used for the measurements. The
shaper is a CR-RC shaper with adjustable pole-zero cancellation and gain.
The hybrid board has two shaper channels and 10 of these boards will be used
for the 19-cell SDD setup.

Fig. 5. Block diagram of the shaper

The block diagram of the shaper is shown in Fig 5. There is a diﬀerential
ampliﬁer with variable gain(g) at the ﬁrst stage. It is followed by a pole-
zero(pz) ﬁlter and an integrator(int). The waveforms from the shaper, as shown
in Fig 6, demonstrate reasonably symmetrical diﬀerential outputs on a load
of 50 Ω.

the positive and the negative outputs. Below is the resulting waveform when the
diﬀerence is taken

Certain aspects were taken into account when choosing the appropriate shap-
ing time. The rise time of the preampliﬁed signal is about 60 ns. The shaping
time should not be much shorter than this value in order to avoid ballistic
deﬁcit. The sampling rate of the ADC system is 66 MHz and at least 4 sam-
ples should be taken at the region of highest signal to noise ratio. The leakage
current of this detector is not the dominating factor, therefore the energy reso-
lution improves with an increasing shaping time. However, it can not be made
very long, since we need fast signals. Considering these constraints a peaking
time of 100 ns was chosen.

2.4 Data Acquisition System

A custom-designed data acquisition (DAQ) system has been developed for
the Compton camera prototype [14], [15]. It consists of channel processors,
an event builder and a bus which transfers the data between the channels
processors and the event builder. Only one channel of one of the channel
processor cards is used for the measurements done with one-cell SDD. The
channel processor card is connected to a parallel port interface card and the
data are transfered to a computer via this interface. The architecture of the
channel processor is shown in Fig 7.

The signals arrive ﬁrst at the channel processor which has both analog and

digital sections. The analog part receives the diﬀerential signals, sends them
to an ADC and the digitized signals are processed by a Xilinx FPGA. At
the FPGA necessary operations such as peak ﬁnding, integration and time
stamping are applied. The ADCs have as mentioned, 66 MHz of sampling
rate and 12 Bit resolution. System performance tests show that the eﬀective
resolution is around 11 Bit. Each processed signal reaches the interface board
and is transfered to a PC.

3 Spectroscopic Measurements

The spectroscopic measurements were done by using the analog and digital
readout electronics described at the previous chapters. The diﬀerential shaper
output is connected to one channel of the single channel processor card. The
channel processor is connected to an interface card and the digitized signal is
transfered to a PC via parallel port connection. Several bias voltages needed
for the SDD are supplied by a custom-designed power supply.

The ﬁrst measurements were done by using a 55Fe source. The spectrum is
shown in Fig. 8a, where both Mn Kα and Kβ peaks can be seen clearly. The
equivalent noise charge (ENC) is about 33 rms electrons which includes noise
contributions from the detector and the electronics. Fig 8b shows the energy
resolution at 5.9 keV as a function of a shaping time. The FWHM value is
about 250 eV at a shaping time of 250 ns and increases with longer shaping
times.

The aim of the Compton camera project is to be able to use high energetic
radionuclides, preferably at least few hundered keV and more. Therefore, it
is interesting to study the performance of the SDD with a radioactive source
emitting higher energetic photons. The spectrums obtained with 109Cd and

4 Conclusion

A multi-channel silicon drift detector is going to be used as a scatter detector
of a Compton camera prototype. The complete chain of analog and digital
readout electronics for the SDD has been tested by using a single cell SDD.
Faster readout has been obtained by using an emitter follower stage imme-
diately after the on-chip FET of the detector. A low noise hybrid voltage
preampliﬁer and a CR-RC hybrid shaper have been used. The data acquisi-
tion was done by using a custom-designed FPGA based readout system. An
ENC of 33 rms electron of the overall system has been measured by using a
shaper with a rise time of 100 ns.

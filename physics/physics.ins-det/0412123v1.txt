Quartz ﬁber calorimetry is a technique the signal generation mechanism of which is based on
the Cherenkov eﬀect. In this article we try to give a comprehensive overview of the subject.
We start with a general introduction to calorimetry where the basic elements that characterize
the development of electromagnetic and hadronic showers are discussed. Then we describe
in detail the operation principle and the properties of calorimeters equipped with quartz
ﬁbers. The main advantages of this type of calorimeters are the radiation hardness, the fast
response and the compact detector dimensions, features that derive from the quartz material
and the speciﬁc mechanism of operation. A section is devoted to presenting the quartz
ﬁber calorimeters that have been built or planned to in various experiments to operate as
centrality detectors, trigger detectors, luminosity monitors or general purpose very forward
calorimeters.

1 Introduction to calorimetry

Calorimetry comprises the experimental methods one develops to perform energy mea-
surement. A calorimeter [1]-[6] is a detector, literally a block of matter with proper

feature is that the resolution of the energy measurement improves with energy, while
the size of the detector scales logarithmically with it. Also of importance is the fact
that a calorimeter is a detector which is sensitive to both charged and neutral inci-
dent particles. Depending on appropriate construction, calorimeters can also provide
position measurement and particle identiﬁcation in addition to energy measurement.
The signal generation mechanism in a calorimeter is as follows: the incident particle
interacts inside the calorimeter volume and initiates a shower of secondary particles,
the shower develops and its products generate signal by passing through the sensitive
material of the calorimeter. The operation principle of the majority of calorimeters
is based on the dE/dx technique, i.e.
the signal depends on the energy deposited
by the shower particles in the sensitive material, and is generated by scintillation or
ionization. The signal can be light, for calorimeters with scintillators, or ionization
charge, for those with gaseous or semiconductive sensitive material. Calorimeters with
a diﬀerent principle of operation are those composed of lead glass or quartz ﬁbers. For
these, the signal generation mechanism is based on the Cherenkov eﬀect.

Calorimeters can be distinguished between electromagnetic and hadronic, whether
they are designed to measure the energy of incident electrons, positrons and photons,
or hadrons, respectively. They are also categorized in homogeneous and sampling

shower production and development and
whole volume is considered sensitive, i.e.
signal generation and collection occur at the same material. The main advantage of this
type of calorimeters is their excellent performance with respect to energy resolution.
A sampling calorimeter is composed of two diﬀerent materials. A passive material,
the absorber, where the shower develops, and the sensitive or active material where
the signal is produced and collected. The absorber is usually copper, steel, lead or
other dense metal. The sensitive material, that can be scintillator plates, gas tubes or
silicon layers, is placed between consecutive absorber layers (“sandwich” structure) or
is uniformly distributed inside the absorber volume, as in the case of scintillation tiles
or ﬁbers (“spaghetti” structure). Sampling calorimeters have worse energy resolution
because the statistical ﬂuctuations in production and collection of their signal are
signiﬁcantly larger compared to homogeneous ones. However, they cost less, have
compact size and are the only practical means one can use to measure the energy of
hadrons.

1.1 Electromagnetic shower development

For energies above 1 GeV, electrons and positrons lose energy through bremsstrahlung,
and photons through pair production [1]-[10]. The secondary particles produced in-
teract through the same processes and a shower develops inside the calorimeter. For

such as bremsstrahlung, Moller scattering, Bhabha scattering or positron annihila-
tion do not contribute signiﬁcantly to energy loss, as shown in ﬁg. 1(a) [10]. The
shower development ceases when energy loss from ionization is greater than that from
bremsstrahlung. The energy loss per unit length from ionization is practically constant,

after traveling distance t = x/X0 inside the calorimeter absorber, the shower will
consist of N = 2t particles, with E/N energy per particle. Production of new particles
stops typically when almost every particle in the shower carries energy around Ec.
Therefore the total particle multiplicity of the shower is roughly equal to E/Ec, and
every particle has traversed distance X0 on average. Thus, the total track length inside
the calorimeter is

ter: the produced signal is proportional to the energy of the incident particle.

1.2 Hadronic shower development

The incidence of a high energy hadron in a calorimeter [11, 12],[1]-[5] produces a
shower of particles due to inelastic collisions with nucleons of the absorber’s nuclei.
Secondary particles are produced, mainly pions and nucleons, in multiplicity which
increases logarithmically with energy per collision. On average 1/3 of the produced
pions are π0’s, that subsequently decay into photons and generate electromagnetic
showers. The fraction of the energy of hadrons that does not dissipate in particle
production is lost through interactions of excitation of nuclei. Generally this type of
interaction does not contribute to signal production.

The characteristic length which governs the longitudinal development of hadronic
showers is the interaction length, λI.
In a way similar to the radiation length for
electromagnetic showers, it is deﬁned as the mean distance that a hadron traverses to
lose (1

1/e) of its energy in inelastic collisions. It is given by

where A, ρ is the mass and the density of the material, respectively, NAv is the Avo-

The longitudinal proﬁle of the energy deposition of a hadronic shower can be pa-
rameterized by a sum of a function with the form shown in eq. 4 and a descending
exponential, representing the purely electromagnetic and the purely hadronic compo-
nent of the shower, respectively. From experimental data the maximum of the shower
occurs at depth tmax, which is approximately

with tmax in units of λI and E in GeV. The total depth that is suﬃcient for 95%

The signal that is generated by a hadronic shower is lower than that produced by an
electromagnetic one of same energy. This is because a signiﬁcant fraction, about 25%,
30%, of the total energy dissipated by the hadronic shower inside the calorimeter is
lost in nuclear break-up and excitation processes that do not contribute to detectable
signal. This intrinsic diﬀerence in the response to the two diﬀerent types of showers
is expressed by the degree of compensation or ratio e/h. This quantity is a character-
istic parameter of a calorimeter and is determined by its operation principle and its
construction. The e/h ratio does not depend on energy, it can be derived indirectly
by the e/π ratio which is energy dependent. The e/π is the ratio of the signal of an
incident electron to the signal produced by the shower of an incident charged pion of
same energy. The relation between the two ratios is given by

1.3 Energy resolution of calorimetric measurement

The development of a shower and the production and collection of its signal are pro-
cesses with statistical ﬂuctuations, the contributions of which determine the energy
resolution of a calorimeter. The number of sources and the amplitude of ﬂuctuations
are larger for hadronic showers than for electromagnetic ones, therefore electromag-
netic calorimeters show better energy resolution than hadronic ones.

Energy resolution for electromagnetic shower

In eq. 10 the total track length of an electromagnetic shower is estimated. We expect
the produced signal to be proportional to the total track length. Practically in a
calorimeter, only particles with energy greater than a threshold value Ecut (
0.5 MeV)
generate detectable signal, thus it is more meaningful to use the total detected track
length, Td. It is

In an ideal homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter of inﬁnite size, without energy
leakage, the only source of ﬂuctuations in signal production is the statistical ﬂuctuation
of length Td, i.e. σ(E)/E = σ(Td)/Td. This is called intrinsic ﬂuctuation because it
describes the ﬂuctuation which is related with the fundamental processes that govern
the production and development of an electromagnetic shower. Its contribution to the
energy resolution is about 0.7%/

For calorimeters which detect light from scintillation or Cherenkov radiation, statistical
ﬂuctuations on the production and collection of photons (photostatistics) contribute to
the total energy resolution. For low light yield this ﬂuctuation is signiﬁcant, because
the mean number of photoelectrons at photomultipliers per GeV of deposited energy
in the calorimeter (npe) is small. It holds σpe = √npe, and thus it is

In sampling calorimeters, in addition to these sources of ﬂuctuations, we also have
sampling ﬂuctuations. These represent the statistical ﬂuctuations in the number of
e−’s and e+’s that traverse the sensitive material between the absorber layers. If d is
the thickness of each absorber layer and T the total track length (eq. 10), then the
number of tracks that traverse the sensitive material is equal to T /d. Using instead
the total detectable track length, Td (eq. 16), the energy resolution reads

There are also contributions to sampling ﬂuctuations from Landau ﬂuctuations and
path length ﬂuctuations [5]. They are negligible for calorimeters with liquid or solid
sensitive material, whereas for gaseous calorimeters we should take them into account
as they could contribute up to 5% to 10% per √E.

Energy resolution for hadronic shower

The intrinsic ﬂuctuations for hadronic showers are large and have a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the total energy resolution. This is due to the fact that on average about 1/4
of the energy that is deposited in the calorimeter is dissipated through processes that
do not contribute to generation of visible signal. This practically invisible fraction is
dominated by large ﬂuctuations, and consequently, the remaining detectable amount
of energy shows large ﬂuctuations as well. Besides, the purely electromagnetic compo-
nent of a hadronic shower is generated mainly by the prompt π0’s that are produced
in the initial interactions. And since the number of π0’s is small, in approximate it
increases logarithmically with energy, it has large statistical ﬂuctuations contributing
signiﬁcantly to the total signal ﬂuctuation. In general, no matter what the calorimeter
structure and its operation principle are, the intrinsic ﬂuctuation contribution to the
energy resolution for hadronic showers is roughly

Contributions from energy leakage and photostatistics are approximated by equations

As already mentioned, a hadronic shower consists of a purely electromagnetic part
and a purely hadronic one, with a relative ratio that depends on the energy of the
incident hadron, and which is approximated by the function fem(E). The intrinsic
diﬀerence in the response of a calorimeter to the two diﬀerent parts of a hadronic
shower is expressed by the e/h ratio. Deviation of e/h from 1 represents the diﬀerence
in eﬃciency to convert the deposited energy to visible signal, depending on the type
of particles in the shower. This aﬀects the energy resolution by a constant term,
dependent on e/h,

by a factor of the order of 15%, 20% [10, 11, 12]. In summary, all non statistical ﬂuctu-
ations contribute to the constant term of the resolution of a calorimeter. Construction
defects, material inhomogeneity, calibration errors, non linear response of electronics
etc., cause resolution degradation which is diﬃcult to estimate in advance.

2 Quartz ﬁber calorimetry

2.1 Motivation

The basic motivation for developing new materials and techniques for detectors is the
continuously increasing demands set by the experimental conditions at new accelera-
tors. At the LHC, and also at the heavy ion physics program at SPS and at RHIC, the
experimental conditions at forward rapidity regions are very hostile for conventional
materials that are used in calorimetry, mainly due to the very high radiation level.
Besides, the calorimeters the signal of which is used in high level triggers must have
fast response to cope with the high event rate in the experiments. For instance, at the
LHC bunch crossing will be every 25 nsec for proton beams, 125 nsec for P b beams.
Calorimeters with quartz ﬁbers fulﬁll both requirements of radiation resistance and
fast response. First because quartz is a radiation hard material up to Grad level total
dose. And second because the operation mechanism of quartz ﬁber calorimeters is
based on the Cherenkov eﬀect, which practically means that the generation and the
duration of their signal do not last more than 10 nsec.
In the following we discuss
in detail the operation principle and the main properties of quartz ﬁber calorimeters
[17]-[35] and [38]-[57], [60, 63, 64, 69].

2.2 Principle of operation and Cherenkov eﬀect

The quartz ﬁber calorimeters are sampling calorimeters. The absorber is made of a
dense material such as copper, iron, lead or tungsten and the sensitive medium is com-
posed of quartz ﬁbers. The incident particles interact with the calorimeter’s absorber
and initiate showers. The charged particles of the shower traversing the optical ﬁbers
produce Cherenkov photons, which are guided along the ﬁbers and are collected by
photomultipliers. Production of Cherenkov radiation occurs when a charged particle
travels in a medium with velocity higher than the velocity of light in that medium. If
β = υ/c is the velocity of the particle and n is the index of refraction (n=n(λ)), then
Cherenkov photons are emitted for

at angle of emission θc, relatively to the axis of motion of the particle. It holds

where α=1/137, z is the particle charge in units of e, λ the wavelength of the photon
and dL the path length in the medium. The emitted light is in the UV part of the
spectrum due to the 1/λ2 production dependence. It should be noted that the yield
of Cherenkov light is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the yield of scintillation
light for the same amount of deposited energy. An intrinsic diﬀerence between the
two eﬀects is that scintillation light is emitted isotropically, whether Cherenkov light
is emitted along a cone with opening angle θc with respect to the trajectory of the
particle. In addition to that, the Cherenkov eﬀect has a production threshold.

Also, it should be emphasized that the Cherenkov eﬀect occurs practically simulta-
neously (< 1 nsec) with the passage of particles and consequently the width of the
produced signal is less than 10 nsec [19, 18, 50, 38].

The index of refraction of quartz is in the range 1.46-1.55, for λ 600-200 nm, respec-
tively (see ﬁg. 2(a) from [19] and also eq. 35). Thus, the threshold velocity βthreshold
is 0.65-0.69 and the angle of emission θc is 46◦-50◦ for β
1. In table 1(a) index of
refraction, velocity and angle of emission for three diﬀerent wavelengths are given. In
table 1(b) we tabulate the energy required for β = 0.65 and 0.99 for various charged
particles. It results that the minimum kinetic energy that a charged particle should
carry to produce Cherenkov light in quartz is 0.33 MeV for electrons and positrons,
119 MeV for pions and 802 MeV for protons.

ters. From eq. 28, we see that the particles of higher velocities produce more light
and so their contribution to the total signal will be larger. In other words this means
that a calorimeter which is based on quartz ﬁbers is sensitive mainly to the core of the
shower [17, 18, 19, 22, 26] since this part consists of charged particles with relatively
larger energies and velocities. On the other hand the calorimeters that are based on dE
dx
technique are mainly sensitive to the charged particles of the shower with lower ener-
gies. Consequently the visible transverse size of electromagnetic and hadronic showers
in quartz ﬁber calorimeters is narrower compared to the size of the showers visible by
dE
dx calorimeters.

The main diﬀerence between the two types of calorimeters is illustrated in ﬁg. 2(b)
(from [19]) which depicts the Cherenkov light yield per unit length (eq. 28) and the
energy deposition per unit length (dE/dx for various absorbers) as a function of particle
velocity. It can be clearly seen that the signiﬁcant part of the signal in conventional
calorimeters is contributed by the lower energy particles of the shower since they
deposit larger amount of energy. Quartz ﬁber calorimeters do not collect the deposited
energy on ﬁbers but the Cherenkov light emitted inside them by the relativistic charged
particles of the shower.

2.3 Light propagation in optical ﬁbers

An optical ﬁber consists of the core, with an index of refraction ncore, and the cladding,
with index nclad. The light propagates inside the ﬁbers due to total internal reﬂection
at the boundary surface of the two elements, and so it must be ncore > nclad. When
the light passes from a medium with index of refraction n1 to a medium with n2, it
′ , θ2 the
is reﬂected and refracted. It holds θ1 = θ1
angles between the normal to the boundary surface of the media and the directions
of the incident, reﬂected and refracted light, respectively. The reﬂection is called
internal or external if n1 > n2 or n1 < n2, respectively. For n1 > n2, and an incident
angle θ
arcsin(n2/n1) we have reﬂection only, without refraction. This reﬂection
is called total internal reﬂection and the minimum incident angle required to occur is
called critical angle. The critical angle for passing from a medium with n1 to n2 is

ﬁber. For quartz ﬁbers (ncore ≃
NA=0.37.

The Cherenkov light is emitted inside ﬁbers at a speciﬁc angle with respect to the
particle direction. The direction dependence of Cherenkov eﬀect combined with the
lightguide condition results to the fact that the light output depends on the angle
at which the particles traverse the ﬁbers. In ﬁg. 3 [19] is shown a ﬁber of radius R
traversed by a particle whose track segment is at distance b from the central axis and
at angle α. At point P, at distance ρ from ﬁber’s central axis, a Cherenkov photon is
emitted and passes through the core-cladding boundary at angle ξ. We deduce:

2.4 Quartz optical ﬁbers

The ﬁbers of this type are composed of synthetic fused silica, term commonly used for
SiO2 in non crystallic state (amorphous material). It is formed by chemical combina-
tion of silicon with oxygen in special production process, which provides high purity,
level of impurities of the order of 1 part per million. It should not be confused with the
fused silica or fused quartz which is a material produced by compression and fusion of
crystals of mineral silica. This, besides SiO2, contains oxides of various elements such
as Fe2O, Al2O3, TiO2, CaO, MgO, Na2O. For clariﬁcation it should be stressed that
by the terms quartz or pure quartz, used often in literature of calorimeters, we mean
synthetic fused silica.

Synthetic fused silica has ﬁne optical properties and is widely used in industry of
optical systems for producing high quality lenses. It is transparent in a wide range of

or collection in IR.

At this point, it should be also mentioned that quartz, in addition to above properties,
is also characterised by extreme resistance to high radiation dose (of the order of
10 Grad) [31], a feature which derives from the strong Si-O chemical bond. Thus the
use of ﬁbers with core and cladding composed of quartz (quartz core + ﬂuorine doped
quartz cladding) [32, 33, 34, 35] is the only solution for calorimeters that operate in
high radiation environment, and in general very hostile conditions for conventional
materials. A disadvantage of this type of ﬁbers is their relative high cost. In addition
it is a material of high hardness, a feature which makes necessary the use of special
shearing methods.

2.5 Basic properties of quartz ﬁber calorimeters

We summarize the basic properties and the main advantages of quartz ﬁber calorimetry
that have been mentioned in previous subsections. The signal in this type of calorime-
ters is the Cherenkov light which is produced inside the ﬁbers by the traversing charged
0.7. The fact that for higher particle veloc-
particles of the shower with β > βthreshold ≃
ity more Cherenkov photons are emitted, in combination with the directionality of the
eﬀect, due to speciﬁc angle of emission, and the limitations imposed by the lightguide
condition in ﬁbers, make quartz ﬁber calorimeters be mainly sensitive to the central
part of the shower. In other words, the visible transverse width of electromagnetic and
hadronic showers is very narrow, in transverse width of about 10 mm and 5-10 cm,

16

G. Mavromanolakis

respectively, 95% of the signal is contained [17, 18, 19, 22, 26] and [39, 50, 54, 60, 69].
This size is 3 to 4 times narrower compared to that of calorimeters operating with the
dE
dx technique. This is well illustrated in ﬁg. 5 and 6 [73, 75], which show the part of
hadronic shower that a dE
dx and a quartz ﬁber based calorimeter is sensitive to, respec-
tively. As a rule of thumb, one can state that the visible part of hadronic showers in
quartz ﬁber calorimeters, and especially for those with 45◦ ﬁber inclination geometry,
has a transverse development which seems to scale with the Moliere radius and not
with the interaction length, as in conventional dE
dx calorimeters. On the other hand,
since the signal of the hadronic showers is produced mainly by their electromagnetic
component, the quartz ﬁber calorimeters are non-compensating (e/h > 1).

Another characteristic feature of quartz ﬁber calorimeters is their very fast response.
The Cherenkov eﬀect is an intrinsically fast process which occurs almost simultaneously
with the passage of particles. Consequently the duration of signal generation and the
signal width do not exceed 10 nsec in time [18, 19, 38, 50].

Using ﬁbers with quartz core and quartz cladding, we can build very radiation hard
calorimeters capable to operate up to total dose level of the order of 10 Grad [31, 33,
34, 35].

The main disadvantage of this calorimetric technique is the low light yield, 2 to 3
orders of magnitude lower compared to scintillator based calorimeters for the same
amount of deposited energy. To maximize the light production, a geometry with ﬁber
inclination at 45◦ with respect to the direction of the incident particles is required.
With such a conﬁguration a better exploitation of the directionality of the Cherenkov
eﬀect and the lightguide condition in ﬁbers is achieved [17, 18, 21, 24, 26, 64]. A 45◦
inclination geometry sets restrictions and diﬃculties in construction and is a consider-
able limitation factor, if we require the calorimeter to provide position measurement
as well. Calorimeters with spaghetti structure, where the ﬁbers are embedded inside
the absorber volume with a 0◦ inclination angle with respect to incoming particles,
have satisfying light yield for incident particles or jets with energy at the TeV scale.
Also, it should be mentioned that quartz ﬁbers are about an order of magnitude more
expensive than scintillating ﬁbers, so in general it is not aﬀordable to increase the light
production by increasing the ﬁlling ratio of the calorimeter.

We conclude this section with table 2, where the main features and properties of quartz
ﬁber calorimetry in comparison with those for dE

dx method are summarized [17]-[35].

3 Quartz ﬁber calorimeters

The main advantages of quartz ﬁber calorimeters are, the radiation hardness, to very
high dose level (of the order of 1 Grad or more), their fast response (< 10 nsec) and
the compact detector dimensions, since the transverse size of the visible shower is
very narrow. Calorimeters of this type operate as centrality detectors, trigger detec-
tors, luminosity monitors or calorimeters at very forward regions.
In the following
subsections we describe the quartz ﬁber calorimeters that are in operation or under

CERN-SPS

The NA50 [36, 37] is a ﬁxed target experiment of the heavy ion physics research
program at CERN-SPS, for detection of matter in quark-gluon plasma phase. The
purpose of the experiment is to study the production of vector mesons, ρ, ω, φ, J/Ψ
in heavy ion collisions (heavy ion beam on lead target) up to 158 GeV/nucleon beam
energy. A quartz ﬁber calorimeter is used to determine the centrality of the collisions.
The calorimeter is placed at 1.6 m after the target, covering pseudorapidity range
η
6.3 (Zero Degree calorimeter) [38]-[41], [56, 57]. A calorimeter with quartz ﬁbers
is imposed by the requirements of tolerance to very high radiation dose expected on
the detector site, of the order of 10 Grad, and of fast response, since it provides the
trigger signal for the experiment. The calorimeter has a spaghetti structure with ﬁbers
embedded in absorber volume at 0◦ inclination with respect to the beam axis. A brief
description of its elements and its main properties is given in table 3. In ﬁg. 7 a general

supersymmetric particles research in pp collisions at √Sp+p = 14 TeV. In the very
forward region (3
5) a calorimeter [43]-[51] with quartz ﬁbers will be used in
order to cope with the high radiation and the high event rate requirements of operation.
The calorimeter has a spaghetti structure, with ﬁbers embedded in absorber volume
at 0◦ inclination with respect to beam axis. Two identical calorimeters are being built,
placed symmetrically in forward and backward regions, and at distance of 11 m from
the interaction point. They provide 2π azimuth coverage and are segmented in towers
with ∆η = ∆φ = 0.175. The speciﬁcations of the CMS Very Forward calorimeter are

3.3 The Zero Degree calorimeters for the ALICE experiment

at CERN-LHC

The ALICE [52] is a heavy ion physics dedicated collider experiment at the LHC. It
is designed to search simultaneously for all observables that have been proposed as

characteristic signatures of production of matter in quark-gluon plasma state. It will
investigate various systems produced in heavy ion collisions up to a center of mass
energy of √SP b+P b = 1148 TeV. Zero degree calorimeters that measure the energy
of incident neutrons and protons which do not participate in the collision (spectator
nucleons) will be used to determine the centrality of the heavy ion collisions. The
experimental conditions impose the use of a detector that comprises very fast response,
since its signal serves as a trigger signal for the other detectors of the experiment,
compact physical dimensions, and high resistance to radiation. These requirements
make a quartz ﬁber calorimeter be the only solution. The ALICE will use two pairs of
neutron and proton quartz ﬁber calorimeters, positioned symmetrically on both sides
of the interaction point and at distance of about 115 m [53]-[57]. Both calorimeters
have spaghetti geometries, with ﬁbers embedded in absorber at 0◦ inclination with
respect to the beam axis. A brief description of their construction and properties is
given in table 5. In ﬁg. 9 a view of the position of the calorimeters between the beam
pipes of the LHC is shown.

3.4 The Very Forward EM calorimeter for the NA52 experi-

ment at CERN-SPS

The NA52 or NEWMASS [58, 59] was a ﬁxed target experiment at the heavy ion
physics program at CERN-SPS. Its objectives included detection of strangelets and
study of anti-nuclei production in collisions of P b beam on P b target, at 158 GeV/
nucleon beam energy. A very forward electromagnetic calorimeter [60] was used to
measure the energy of photons, produced from π0 decays, in order to determine the
centrality of the collision. It was placed at 0.8 m after the target, covering pseudora-
pidity interval 2.6
4.3, and 2π in azimuth. The calorimeter was equipped with
quartz ﬁbers to cope with the high radiation dose expected and for fast response. It
consisted of consecutive absorber-ﬁbers layers (“sandwich” geometry) inclined at 45◦
angle with respect to the beam axis. The calorimeter was also azimuthally segmented
in 8 sectors to facilitate studies on anisotropy of transverse energy ﬂow. The main
features of the calorimeter are tabulated in table 6, a schematic view is given in ﬁg. 10.

3.5 The Zero Degree calorimeters of the experiments at BNL-

RHIC

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL provides colliding Au ion beams at 100 GeV
per nucleon (√SAu+Au = 39.4 TeV), lighter ion beams at 125 GeV/nucleon and pro-
ton beams at 250 GeV/proton. There are 4 experiments [61, 62] dedicated to the
detection and study of the quark-gluon plasma phase. Each experiment is equipped
with a pair of identical Zero Degree calorimeters [63, 64], positioned symmetrically
on both sides of the interaction point, and at 18 m distance. The calorimeters de-
termine the event centrality and provide triggering signal by measuring the energy of
the nucleons that do not participate in the collision. They also operate as luminosity

monitors [65, 66]. Each calorimeter consists of consecutive absorber-ﬁbers layers that
are inclined 45◦ with respect to the beam axis. The speciﬁcations of the calorimeters
and their schematic views are given in table 7 and depicted in ﬁg. 11, respectively.

3.6 The Very Forward EM calorimeter for the H1 experiment

at DESY-HERA

The H1 [67, 68] is one of the experiments at the DESY-HERA ep collider (Ee= 27.5
GeV, Ep= 920 GeV). Its goal is to study the structure of the proton and the properties
of its constituents. An electromagnetic calorimeter [69], which measures the energy of
photons produced by bremsstrahlung of electrons at the interaction point, is used as
a luminosity monitor. The calorimeter has quartz ﬁbers as sensitive material to with-
stand the radiation level.
It consists of consecutive absorber-ﬁbers trapezoid layers
with 45◦ inclination with respect to the beam. A special feature of this calorimeter is
that it is also capable to measure the impact point of the incident photons. In particu-
lar, this is achieved by alternating ﬁber planes with horizontal and vertical orientation.
Each ﬁber plane is divided in 12 ﬁber strips of 10 mm width. The calorimeter signal is
read out by 12+12 photomultipliers, for the horizontal and for the vertical set of strips,
respectively. With such a conﬁguration, a position resolution of σ= 5 mm/
E(GeV )
is achieved. The construction parameters and the main properties of the calorimeter
are tabulated in table 8. A general view is shown in ﬁg. 12.

3.7 The CASTOR calorimeter for the CERN-LHC

The calorimeter is proposed as a very forward detector of the ALICE or CMS exper-
iments at the LHC. Its main objective is to search in the baryon rich, very forward
rapidity region of central P b + P b collisions for unusual events, the so called Centauro
events, and for “long penetrating objects”, assumed to be strangelets, by measuring
the hadronic and electromagnetic energies and the longitudinal proﬁle of the hadronic
7.14, and
showers [70]-[75]. It is planned to cover the pseudorapidity range 5.46
2π in azimuth. The calorimeter is azimuthally divided in 8 sectors and longitudinally
segmented in consecutive layers of W absorber interleaved with quartz ﬁber planes
having 45◦ inclination with respect to the beam axis. The calorimeter is composed of
a number of channels per sector, read-out by aircore lightguides that will collect and
transmit the signal of each channel to its corresponding photomultiplier (see ﬁg. 13)
[74, 75]. The speciﬁcations and the main properties of the calorimeter are tabulated
in table 9. A general view is shown in ﬁg. 13.

3.8 Other calorimeters

To the knowledge of the author in order to complete the above list we should also
mention the W/quartz ﬁber polarimeter at the SLD experiment at SLAC and the dual

readout calorimeter R&D project. The former is a calorimeter consisting of sandwiches
of tungsten plates and ﬁber layers with alternating vertical and horizontal orientation
115 mm3 it
to allow position measurement. With a ﬁducial volume of 43.5
was capable to measure the energy and the impact point of the Compton scattered
photons in order to determine precisely the polarization of the electron beam [76, 77].
In the latter project, a hadronic calorimeter is proposed to be equipped with both
scintillating and quartz ﬁbers. A hadron shower generates signals in both materials
but by diﬀerent parts of the shower, as discussed in 2.2 and 2.5. By measuring both
signals simultaneously and combining them it is possible to determine the electro-
magnetic content of hadron showers on an event-by-event basis. This complementary
information is then used to correct the energy reconstruction to achieve better response
linearity and improve the energy resolution for hadronic showers. First results on this
concept with a “spaghetti” geometry prototype can be found in [78].

4 Summary

The quartz ﬁber calorimetry is a technique the signal generation mechanism of which
is based on the Cherenkov eﬀect. Namely, the charged particles of the shower with
β > βthreshold when traversing the ﬁbers produce Cherenkov light. The light is cap-
tured and lightguided inside the ﬁbers and ﬁnally collected by photomultipliers. We
described in detail the operation principle and the main properties of this technique
and we discussed the quartz ﬁber calorimeters that have been built or planned to in
various experiments. In summary, the advantages of quartz ﬁber calorimeters are, the
radiation hardness, the fast response and the compact detector dimensions. They op-
erate as centrality detectors, trigger detectors, luminosity monitors or general purpose
calorimeters at very forward regions.

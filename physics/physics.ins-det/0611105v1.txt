Abstract

We report on the measurements of the total charge changing fragmentation cross sections in high-energy
nucleus-nucleus collisions using Fe, Si and Pb incident ions. Several stacks of CR39 nuclear track detectors
with diﬀerent target combinations were exposed at normal incidence to high energy accelerator beams to
integrated densities of about 2000 ions/cm2. The nuclear track detector foils were chemically etched, and
ion tracks were measured using an automatic image analyzer system. The cross section determination is
based on the charge identiﬁcation of beam ions and their fragments and on the reconstruction of their path
through the stacks.

1 Introduction

Fragmentation studies of high energy ions are relevant for nuclear physics, cosmic ray
physics, astrophysics and applied physics [1]. High energy heavy ion fragmentation cross-
sections are also useful to describe the eﬀects of primary cosmic radiation hitting spacecraft
walls. Important applications of the propagation of fast heavy ion beams through matter
are given in space radiation protection and in the ﬁeld of cancer therapy [2].

In this paper we present experimental results on the fragmentation of 158 A GeV lead
ions, 1 A GeV and 0.41 A GeV iron ions and 1 A GeV silicon ions. These measurements are
part of a series of exposures at CERN, Brookhaven National Laboratory and CHIBA aimed
to study the response of the CR39 nuclear detector and to determine the fragmentation
cross sections of Pb, Fe and Si ions projectiles. Targets of C, CR39, CH2, Al, Cu and Pb
were used; they were chosen to be thin enough to minimize multiple interactions and thick
enough to produce a suﬃcient number of fragments.

2 Experimental procedure

We exposed several stacks made of CR39 nuclear track detectors and diﬀerent targets to
diﬀerent energy beams at: CERN-SPS, 158 A GeV Pb82+; BNL-NSRL, 1 A GeV Fe26+ and

Si14+; CHIBA, 0.41 A GeV Fe26+. Each stack has CR39 sheets upstream and downstream
of the target. The exposures were performed at normal incidence. The charged fragments
produced by projectile interactions with target nuclei keep most of the projectile longitudinal
velocity. They can be detected after the target in CR39 detectors. Our CR39 sheets were
manufactured by the Intercast Europe Co. of Parma, Italy, using a specially designed line
of production [3].

The detection principle of the CR39 [4] is based on the fact that a through-going heavily
ionizing particle produces a cylindrical radiation-damaged region along the ion trajectory
creating a “latent track”. This damaged region is chemically reactive and can be etched by
an appropriate chemical treatment. As a result, an etched cone is formed on both sides of
each detector sheet, see Fig. 1. The cones are visible under a microscope. After exposure,
the CR39 detectors were etched for 30 h in a 6N NaOH water solutions at a temperature of
70 ◦C.

Figure 1: Left: Traks of Pb82+ ions and their fragments in a CR39 detector; for this photomicrography the
detector was inclined to show both sides. Right: Sketch of an “etched track” in one side of the detector for
a normally incident ion.

An automatic image analyzer system [5] was used to scan the detector surfaces and
measure the etch-pit cone areas. For each etch-pit cone the base area, the eccentricity, the
central brightness and the coordinates were measured.

A tracking procedure was used to reconstruct the path of the beam and of the fragments.
To better identify the projectile and fragment charges we performed an average of the
measured etch-pit areas for each track in 3 or more sheets. Distributions of the etched cone
base areas for CR39 detectors located after the fragmentation targets are shown in Fig. 2.
Etched cone base areas are given for 1 A GeV Si14+, 1 A GeV Fe26+ and 0.41 A GeV Fe26+.
Well separated peaks for the primary ions and for fragments are observed and a charge can
be assigned to individual peaks; for a given z/β value, we have the same cone base area for
diﬀerent energies (Fig. 2).

The reduced etch rate p=vT /vB, where vT and vB are the track and bulk etch velocities,
respectively, was used to characterize the detector response [6,7]. It was determined on the
basis of the surface area measurements of the etch-pits. The response of the detector is

given by the relation p vs REL (Restricted Energy Loss); the REL was computed using the
Bethe-Block formula (Particle Data Group). Fig. 3 shows the measured calibration curves
(p vs REL) for relativistic Pb, Fe and Si ions.

Figure 2: Distributions of the etched cone areas (average areas for each track over 3 sheets) for CR39
detectors located after the fragmentation targets. Peaks for incident ions and their fragments are well
separated and charges can be assigned to each peak. For a given z/β value, we have the same cone base
area for diﬀerent beam energies.

3 Total charge-changing cross sections

For the determination of the total charge-changing cross sections, σtot, the number of beam
ions before the target (incident ions) and the number of beam ions after the targets were
measured [8-11]. The target thicknesses were chosen to optimize the fragmentation process.
Our measured σtot for the collisions of 158 A GeV Pb ions, 1 A GeV Fe26+ and Si14+
and 0.41 A GeV Fe26+ on diﬀerent targets are given in the sixth column of Table 1. The
fragmentation charge-changing cross section for beam ions was evaluated using the formula

σtot(exp) = XT · ln(Ni / Ns)
(1)
where XT = AT /ρT · tT · NA for each target; Ni is the number of primary ions, NS the
number of beam ions surviving after the target, ρT the target density, AT the atomic mass
of the target, tT the target thickness and NA is the Avogadro number. In this procedure,
successive fragmentation processes are neglected. Hydrogen cross sections were obtained
from the measured cross sections on carbon and on CH2 using the formula:

4 Conclusions

The total charge-changing cross sections in diﬀerent targets were measured using beams of
Pb nuclei of 158 A GeV, 1 A GeV Fe26+ and Si14+, 0.41 A GeV Fe26+ with CR39 nuclear
track detectors placed before and after the targets, Table 1. Our results are in agreement
with the theoretical values given by eq. (3).

The calibration of the CR39 was determined by the relation p vs REL (Restricted Energy
Loss) that shows that a unique curve gives the response of the detector at diﬀerent energies.
We also exposed diﬀerent stacks of CR39 to 3, 5 and 10 A GeV for both Fe and Si ions
at the BNL AGS. These studies are in progress and should become available in the near
future.

Abstract
We show that liquid organic scintillator detectors (e. g., KamLAND and Borexino) can measure
the 8B solar neutrino ﬂux by means of the νe charged current interaction with the 13C nuclei
naturally contained in the scintillators. The neutrino events can be identiﬁed by exploiting the
time and space coincidence with the subsequent decay of the produced 13N nuclei. We perform a
detailed analysis of the background in KamLAND, Borexino and in a possible liquid scintillator
detector at SNOLab, showing that the 8B solar neutrino signal can be extracted with a reasonable
uncertainty in a few years of data taking. KamLAND should be able to extract about 18 solar
neutrino events from the already collected data. Prospects for gigantic scintillator detectors (such
as LENA) are also studied.

INTRODUCTION

Observations of solar neutrinos [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] have oﬀered the ﬁrst experimental
evidence in favor of non-standard eﬀects, in particular neutrino ﬂavor transitions induced
by non-zero neutrino masses and mixings. Solar neutrinos have been detected by radio-
chemical experiments (i. e., Homestake [1], Gallex/GNO [2, 3] and SAGE [4]) which give an
energy-integrated information on the solar neutrino ﬂuxes, and by real time water Cherenkov
detectors (i. e., Kamiokande/Super-Kamiokande [5, 6] and SNO [7]) which allow to ob-
serve the spectral distribution of solar neutrino events. However, the detection threshold in
Cherenkov detectors is limited to about 5 MeV by the radiopurity of the target mass and,
as a consequence, only high energy 8B solar neutrinos spectrum has been measured.

In the next future, liquid organic scintillator detectors, such as KamLAND [8] and Borex-
ino [9, 10], will be operating with the goal of measuring the low energy solar neutrino ﬂuxes,
in particular 7Be, CNO and pep solar neutrinos. The KamLAND experiment is a 1 kT
detector located in the Kamioka mine (Japan), at a depth of 2700 m.w.e. of rock, operat-
ing continuously since January 2002, with the main goal of measuring the ﬂux of the ¯νe’s
coming from all the Japanese nuclear power plants. This experiment has spectacularly con-
ﬁrmed the so-called Large Mixing Angle (LMA) solution to the solar neutrino problem (see,
e. g., [11] for a recent reanalysis). Borexino is a 0.3 kT liquid scintillator detector which is
being commissioned at Gran Sasso (Italy), under 3800 m.w.e. of rock, whose main goal is
the measurement of the 7Be solar neutrino ﬂux. Moreover, it has been recently proposed to
1 kT liquid scintillator detector, denominated SNO+, at the SNO site (SNO-
realize a
Lab, Canada) under 6000 m.w.e. of rock, after the completion of the SNO detector physics
program [12]. It is also under discussion the possibility to realize a gigantic (
30kT) liq-
uid scintillator detector, the Low Energy Neutrino Astrophysics (LENA) detector [13], in
4000 m.w.e.), although other sites
the Pyh¨asalmi mine (Finland) at a depth of 1450 m (
(e. g., underwater in the site of Pylos in Greece) have also been proposed. The observation
of solar neutrinos in these detectors, through ν
e elastic scattering, is not a simple task,
since neutrino events cannot be separated from the background, and it can be accomplished
only if the detectors contamination will be kept very low [9]. Moreover, only mono-energetic
sources such as 7Be or pep neutrinos can be detected, taking advantage of the Compton-like
shoulder edge produced in the event spectrum.

In this paper, we show that organic liquid scintillator detectors can also measure the
8B solar neutrino ﬂux by means of the νe charged current interaction with the 13C nuclei
naturally contained in the scintillators. The possibility to use 13C as a target for 8B neutrinos
was pointed out in the past by [14, 15, 16]. Here, we propose a technique to tag the solar
neutrino events. Namely, we propose to identify the signal by looking at the time and space
coincidence with the decay of the produced 13N nuclei. We perform a detailed calculation
of the solar neutrino signal and of the background in KamLAND, Borexino and SNO+,
showing that these detectors will be able to extract the signal with a reasonable uncertainty
in a few years of data taking. It should be stressed that the proposed technique does not
involve any modiﬁcation of the experimental setup, since one expects a background-to-signal
ratio of the order of 1 or less even assuming the natural isotopic abundance of 13C (
1%)
and the contamination levels already reached in the KamLAND detector [17].

∼

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we discuss the neutrino interactions
with 13C. In Sec. III we calculate the solar neutrino event rates. In Sec. IV we analyze the
space and time coincidence with the decay of the produced 13N nuclei. Background issues

are described in Sec. V. Sec. VI presents the expected sensitivity for KamLAND, Borexino
and SNO+ and prospects for LENA. In Sec. VII we draw our conclusions.

II. NEUTRINO INTERACTIONS ON 13C

The 13C is a stable isotope of carbon with a natural isotopic abundance I = 1.07%. A
small amount of 13C is, thus, naturally present in organic liquid scintillators and can be used
as a target for neutrino detection. The relevant detection process in our discussion is the
charged current (CC) transition to 13N ground state:

νe + 13C

13N(gnd) + e− .

→

(1)

The reaction threshold is Q = 2.22 MeV and, thus, only 8B solar neutrinos are detectable
(with a neglible contribution from hep neutrinos). In liquid scintillators one observes the
electron produced in the ﬁnal state with a visible energy which, neglecting the detector
energy resolution, is simply equal to the electron kinetic energy Te. The cross section of
reaction (1) is known with great accuracy, since it can be deduced from the decay time of
13N. One has [15]:

and a decay time τ = 862.6 s. In this case, the visible energy is the sum of the positron
kinetic energy and the energy released in e+e− annihilation, so that the delayed events have
a continuous energy spectrum in the range [1.02, 2.22] MeV. Moreover, in the absence of
macroscopic motions in the detector, the 13N nucleus essentially does not move from its
original position. The expected displacement due to recoil and diﬀusion2 during the decay
time τ is, indeed, smaller than the typical detector spatial resolution, σ
10 cm. This
means that the prompt event produced by the reaction (1) and the delayed event produced
by the decay (3) have to be observed essentially in the same position. This condition, as we
will see in the following sections, is extremely eﬀective in reducing the background.

Other interaction channels of low energy neutrinos with 13C can, in principle, be consid-
ered. First, we discuss the CC transition to 13N excited states. For solar neutrinos, only the
lowest excited state (at 3.51 MeV) could be of practical importance. The cross section for
this process is about 30% of that for the ground state and it is calculated theoretically with
40% [15]. However, the 13N∗(3.51 MeV) decays almost
an uncertainty at the level of 30
immediately to 12C+p with almost 100% branching ratio [19]. As a consequence, it cannot
be discriminated by the coincidence with the delayed events (3). The other relevant process
is the neutral current (NC) transition:

−

νx + 13C

νx + 13C∗ .

(4)

→
Here, only the excited state 13C∗(3.68MeV) is relevant and the excitation to other levels has
negligible cross section. The cross section for this process, averaged over the 8B neutrino
spectrum, is
40% uncertainty.
The process is in principle very interesting since it can give a measure of the total 8B ﬂux and
can be also tagged by a monochromatic γ-ray emission back to the ground state. However,
the great uncertainty and the low cross section make this process hard to be competitive
with the NC measurement made by SNO.

In this paper, we will mainly focus on the information which can be obtained from
reaction (1), which, at present, seems more interesting in view of the larger and much better
known cross section, and of the delayed detection tagging with the 13N decay.

III. THE 8B SOLAR NEUTRINO SIGNAL

A neutrino of energy Eν interacting with 13C through reaction (1) produces an electron
Q (neglecting the 13N recoil). The rate Rν of prompt events
with kinetic energy Te = Eν −
(per unit mass) produced by 8B solar neutrinos in the energy window [Te,1, Te,2] is thus
simply given by:

to a possible deformation of parent solar neutrino spectrum. In particular, the diﬀerences
between the two curves in Fig. 1 directly reﬂect the behavior of the electron neutrino sur-
vival probability in LMA scenarios. Namely, the rise of the LMA spectrum (dashed line)
with respect to the standard case (solid line) below Eν ∼

electron energy) is due to the transition from vacuum averaged neutrino oscillations at small
energies to purely adiabatic transitions at large energies. The observation of this feature
would be very important as a ﬁnal conﬁrmation of matter eﬀect in solar neutrino oscilla-
tions. However, it will be extremely hard to observe it in the present detectors, due to the
smallness of the expected event rates.

(2.8 MeV) has been chosen to reduce the background from U
Th contamination. The
upper bound 5.5 MeV has been chosen to focus on the low energy part of the spectrum,
which, as explained above, is particularly interesting and, moreover, is practically unex-
plored by Super-Kamiokande and SNO. As we can see, the counting rates are of the order of
kTy−1. Moreover, they will be further reduced by the cuts, essential to reduce
10
the background. However, as we will see in the next sections, the background levels are ex-
tremely low so that it will be possible to extract the solar neutrino signal with a reasonable
uncertainty. We remark that the proposed measure does not require any modiﬁcation of the
present experimental set-up and, although with a larger uncertainty, can be complementary
to those coming from SNO and Super-Kamiokande.

We remark, that the above equation is valid in the assumption that the displacement between
the point where 13N is created and the point where it decays is small with respect to σ. For
that to happen, the macroscopic motions in the liquid scintillator have to be suﬃciently
slow. This can be achieved, for example, by maintaining a small temperature gradient
pointing upward everywhere in the detector. KamLAND data show that the measured
average displacement of the diﬀusive 222Rn over its 5.5 d mean life is less than 1 m [23].
Therefore, the assumption that 13N nuclides displacement over their 15 minutes lifetime can
be kept smaller than detector resolution seems justiﬁed.

5 If we model the detector spatial resolution with a gaussian function f (x, x0)

x0)2/2σ2],
where x0 is the true position of the event and x is the observed position of the event, the probability
that the prompt event is observed in the position xp and the delayed in the position xd can be cast

that the cuts must be optimized according to each detector’s capabilities and performances.
For the KamLAND detector, moreover, we restrict the delayed energy window to [E1, E2] =
[1.3, 2.22] MeV in order to reduce the background from 210Bi originated by the decay of 210Pb
that can be either produced by build-up due to 222Rn contamination in the liquid scintillator
or caused by an intrinsic impurity.6 This reduces further the eﬃciency by a factor 0.77. For
Borexino (and SNO+), we consider instead the full range [1.02, 2.22] MeV, assuming that
the 210Bi background contribution will be further reduced, since this is a pre-requisite for
the observation of sub-MeV solar neutrinos.7

As a ﬁnal result, the expected signal event rates are at the level of 10

In order to observe such low counting rates, one clearly needs detectors with suﬃciently low
background levels (and, of course, eﬃcient background rejection). Present detectors, as we
shall see in the next section, already satisfy this requirement.

V. THE BACKGROUND

There are three main sources of background for the proposed measure. These are:

i) Internal background due to U

Th contamination and to contamination from long

lived radon daughters out of secular equilibrium with 238U (in particular 210Pb);

−

ii) Cosmogenic background due to muon-induced production of radioactive nuclides, such

as 11C, 10C , etc.;

iii) Elastic ν

e scattering by solar neutrinos.

−

These background sources are well known, so that it is possible to perform a detailed analysis
of their relevance. This is clearly important, because it allows to make a realistic estimate.
We remark, however, that the real background level will be measured directly by the exper-
iments with great accuracy, being the background event rate much larger than the signal
event rate both in the prompt and delayed energy window (before space and time cuts are
applied).

6 At present 210Pb is an important contamination in KamLAND which will be removed by puriﬁcation to

allow solar neutrinos detection.

7 If the detector has an intrinsic eﬃciency ǫp (ǫd) for the prompt (delayed) window, the global eﬃciency is
ǫd. We assume for simplicity ǫp = ǫd = 1.

In Tab. II, we show the contribution of each background source to the total background
rates (per unit mass) in KamLAND, Borexino and SNO+. We have assumed that the
Th contamination in the detectors is at the 10−17 g/g level, which correspond to the
U
present contamination in the KamLAND detector [17]. The internal background due to
νµτ
the elastic scattering of solar neutrinos on electrons has been evaluated assuming νe →
ﬂavor oscillations with the oscillation parameters given in Eq. (7). Finally, the cosmogenic
contribution has been obtained by rescaling the results of [24], which are relative to Borexino,
also to KamLAND and SNO+. This can be done by considering that the muon induced

background Rµ in a given experiment scales as Rµ ∝
Eµi

ﬂux at the experimental site,

various cosmogenic background sources. The relevant cosmogenic nuclei and their half-lives
are reported in Tab. IV. We see that only 11C and 10C nuclei have a long lifetime. The
background coming from the other cosmogenics can be eﬃciently rejected simply extending
the muonic veto to few seconds after the muon passage through the detector. However, in
order to avoid further losses of eﬃciency due to the veto dead-time, we rejected only the
background events coming from the (fast) decay of 12B. In the last four rows of Tab. IV we

windows considered in this work. We see that the main contribution to cosmogenic back-
ground in the prompt energy windows come from 10C, while the dominant source in delayed
windows is provided by 11C nuclides.
It was recently shown [25] that 11C-induced back-
ground can be greatly reduced by a three fold coincidence with the parent muon track and
the subsequent neutron capture on protons. However, in order to be extremely conservative,
we have not considered this possibility.9

In the last two columns of Tab. II, we show the background in the prompt energy windows
after the coincidence criteria are applied. This is obtained by considering that the probability
to have a background event in the delayed energy window when space and time cuts are
applied is simply equal to the average number of delayed background events during the time

9 An additional background not included above is provided by the interaction of cosmogenic protons with
13C, according to 13C(p, n)13N. These events are potentially dangerous because, being followed by the
decay of the produced 13N, they cannot be discriminated by the coincidence (a rejection is, anyhow,
possible by looking at the subsequent neutron capture on protons). We have estimated, by MonteCarlo
simulations, that this background component is negligible, being the cosmogenic proton interaction rate
with 13C of the order

10−2 kTy−1 in Borexino.

10 The probability to have at least one background event inside a certain (spatial and/or temporal and/or
energy) window should be calculated by means of a Poissonian distribution. However, since the number
of background events is very small, the probability is practically equal to the average number of events in
the considered window.

∼

10

despite of the large number of background events (several thousands per kTy) in the prompt
and delayed energy window, the fake coincidences are rare (tenth per kTy in KamLAND,
few per kTy in Borexino or almost absent in SNO+), and comparable or lower than the
expected signal. For this reason we think that a measure of the 8B solar neutrino ﬂux is
feasible.

VI. EXPECTED SENSITIVITY AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

Since real and fake coincidences are indistinguishable, the number of signal events NS
has to be obtained from the diﬀerence between the total number of observed events NT and
the number of background events NB:

where S is the signal event rate, B is the background event rate and

error in Eq. (14):

As anticipated in the previous section, the background will be directly measured by the
experiments. More precisely, one measures the prompt and the delayed background rates
and, then, determines the ﬁnal background rate B through Eq. (13). The uncertainty δB

In Borexino and in SNO+, due to the larger depth of the experimental sites, the
background-to-signal ratio is much less than one. The sensitivity is thus only limited by
the statistical error of the signal events. The low background level allows to explore with
suﬃcient accuracy the energy windows [2.8, 5.5] MeV for which, at present, we have no direct
information. This also indicates that, in these experiments, it will be possible to decrease
the lower bound of the energy windows (2.8 MeV) with only a moderate decrease of the

We remark that, even if the background is negligible, the low expected counting rates do
not allow to observe a possible distortion of solar neutrino event spectrum, unless the 13C
abundance is enriched and/or one considers gigantic detectors. In principle, 13C enrichment
is possible.13 However, the current separation techniques probably do not allow a massive
production of this isotope. For this reason, we do not consider in detail this possibility.
One should note, however, that even a partial enrichment (e. g., corresponding to a 13C
30%) could allow to obtain important results, like e. g., the

in Finland at a depth comparable to that of Borexino (
4000 m.w.e.). This means that the
cosmogenic background will be suﬃciently low for the proposed measure. The scintillator
should be composed mainly by PXE (C16H18, with a molecular mass µ = 210.31 and a density
density ρ = 0.998 g/cm3), but, of course, the ﬁnal composition has yet to be decided. It
is clear that, in such a large detector, it will be very hard to keep the internal background
low. However, the gain in statistics will probably overcompensate this limitation. To give
an example, in one year of data taking with a ﬁducial mass equal to 30 kT, one obtains a
better sensitivity than in SNO+ (with 1 kT ﬁducial mass), even assuming a background-
to-signal ratio of the order of ten. For this reason, we believe that the LENA detector has
the capability to perform a precise measure of the 8B ﬂux (comparable to that provided by
Super-Kamiokande and/or SNO) in a few years of data taking.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have discussed the possibility to detect 8B solar neutrinos by using the
νe CC-interaction with 13C nuclei naturally contained in organic liquid scintillators. The
proposed detection process has a low threshold (Q = 2.22MeV) and large and well-know
cross section. Moreover, one can take advantage of the subsequent decay of the produced
13N nuclei to discriminate neutrino events from the background.
We have calculated the expected event rates (of the order of

20 kTy−1) for KamLAND,
Borexino and an hypothetical Borexino-like experiment situated at SNOlab (SNO+). More-
over, we have evaluated thoroughly all the possible sources of (external and internal) back-
ground in the three considered detectors. We have shown that the background-to-signal
ratio is

2 in KamLAND, while is much less than 1 in Borexino and SNO+.

Abstract

The concentration of primary radiation induced defects has been previously esti-
mated considering both the explicit mechanisms of the primary interaction between
the incoming particle and the nuclei of the semiconductor lattice, and the recoil
energy partition between ionisation and displacements, in the frame of the Lind-
hard theory. The primary displacement defects are vacancies and interstitials, that
are essentially unstable in silicon. They interact via migration, recombination, an-
nihilation or produce other defects. In the present work, the time evolution of the
concentration of defects induced by hadrons in silicon is modelled, after irradiation.
In some approximations, the diﬀerential equations representing the time evolution
processes could be decoupled. The theoretical equations so obtained are solved an-
alytically for a wide range of particle ﬂuences and/or for a wide energy range of
the incident particles, for diﬀerent temperatures, and the corresponding stationary
solutions are presented.

1 Introduction

A point defect in a crystal is an entity that causes an interruption in the lattice
periodicity. In this paper, the terminology and deﬁnitions in agreement with
M. Lannoo and J. Bourgoin [1] are used in relation to defects.

Vacancies and interstitials are produced in materials exposed to irradiation in
equal quantities. In radiation ﬁelds, after the interaction between the incoming
particles and the target, mainly two classes of degradation eﬀects are observed:
surface and bulk damage, the last one due to the displacement of atoms from
their sites in the lattice. For electrons and gammas, the eﬀects are dominantly
at the surface, while heavy particles (pions, protons, neutrons, ions) produce
both types of damages.

In silicon, vacancies and interstitials are essentially unstable and interact via
migration, recombination, annihilation or produce other defects. The system
evolves toward natural equilibrium.

The problem of the annealing of radiation induced defects in semiconduc-
tor materials is old. Several models, empirical or more theoretic, have been
previously proposed to explain these phenomena; see for example [2–8] and
references cited therein.

In the present paper, the time evolution of the primary radiation induced
defects in silicon is studied, in the frame of a simpliﬁed phenomenological
model based on direct interactions between the primary induced defects and
the impurities present in the material, assuming that the annealing phenomena
start after irradiation.

2 Equations for the kinetics of radiation induced defects. General

formulation

The physical model under investigation is the following: equal concentrations
of vacancies and interstitials have been produced by irradiation, in much
greater concentrations than the corresponding thermal equilibrium values,
corresponding to each temperature. Both the pre-existing defects and those
produced by irradiation, as well as the impurities, are assumed to be randomly
distributed in the solid. An important part of the vacancies and interstitials
annihilate. The sample contains certain concentrations of impurities which can
trap interstitials and vacancies respectively, and form stable defects.

In the present paper, vacancy-interstitial annihilation, interstitial migration to
sinks, vacancy and interstitial impurity complex formation as well as divacancy
formation are considered. The sample could contain more impurities that trap
vacancies or interstitials, and in this case all processes are to be taken into
account.

The following notations are used: V - monovacancy concentration; I - free
interstitial concentration, J1 - total impurity ”1” concentration (impurity ”1”

2

traps interstitials and forms the complex C1); C1 - interstitial-impurity con-
centration: one interstitial trapped for one complex formed; J2 - total impu-
rity ”2” concentration (impurity ”2” traps vacancies and forms the complex
C2); C2 - vacancy-impurity concentration: one vacancy trapped for one com-
plex formed; V2 - divacancy concentration. All concentrations are expressed
as atomic fractions.

This picture could be written in terms of chemical reactions by the simple
kinetic scheme:

V + I

K1

The corresponding diﬀerential equations are:

= −K1V I − K5V (J20 − C2) + K6C2 − K7V 2 + K8V2

(6)

dI

(9)

(10)

If N is the total defect concentration, expressed as atomic fraction:

N = V + I + 2V2 + C1 + C2

(11)

then it satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation:

dN
dt

= −2K1V I

(12)

The initial conditions, at t = 0, are: at the end of the irradiation, there are
equal concentrations of interstitials and vacancies; I0 = V0; the concentrations
of impurities are J10 and J20 respectively, there are no complexes in the sample:
C10 = C20 = 0 and no divacancies V20 = 0.

The reaction constants K1 and K3 are determined by the diﬀusion coeﬃcient
for the interstitial atom to a substitutional trap, and therefore K1 = K3:

K1 = 30ν exp (−Ei1/kBT )

(13)

where Ei1 is the activation energy of interstitial migration and ν the vibra-
tional frequency. The reaction constant in process (2) is proportional to the
sink concentration α:

K2 = ανλ2 exp (−Ei1/kBT )

(14)

with λ the jump distance.

4

K4 = 5ν exp(cid:18)Ei1 + B1
kBT (cid:19)

K5 = 30ν exp (−Ei2/kBT )

with Ei2 the activation energy for vacancy migration;

K6 = 5ν exp(cid:18)−

Ei2 + B2

kBT (cid:19)

K7 = 30ν exp (−Ei2/kBT )

K8 = 5ν exp(cid:18)−

Ei2 + B3

kBT (cid:19)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

where B1 is the binding energy of C1, B2 the binding energy of C2 and B3 is
the corresponding binding energy of divacancies.

Due to the mathematical diﬃculties to solve analytically the complete diﬀer-
ential equation system, some simpliﬁcations are necessary.

3 Hypothesis, approximations and discussions

The interstitials are much more mobile in silicon in respect to vacancies, and
are characterised by an activation energy of migration a factor of 2 times
smaller. This fact permits the introduction of the following hypothesis: the ﬁrst
two processes are the most rapid, and we introduce two time scales: in the ﬁrst
one, the processes (1) and (2) are studied, and interstitial concentration decays
much rapidly than vacancy concentration. A cut-oﬀ condition for I is imposed
(a p times decrease of interstitial concentration). The vacancy concentration
determined by this procedure is the initial value for the processes (4) and (5),
and will be denoted by Vi. The process (3) is considered less important, and
is neglected in the following discussion.

5

So, for the ”ﬁrst stage”, after some simple manipulations, from (1) and (2),
the equation:

dI
dt

= 1 +

K2
K1V

has been obtained, with the solution:

and:

I = V +

K2
K1

ln

V
V0

t =

lnh1 + K1V (t)
K2 ln (V (t))

K2 ln(V (t))i

(20)

(21)

(22)

Imposing the cut-oﬀ condition for the concentration of interstitials, both Vi
and the characteristic time could be found. As speciﬁed, Vi is used as initial
vacancy concentration for the second step in the analysis, where the equations
(4) and (5) are considered. This system of equations, expressing the kinetics
of divacancy and vacancy-impurity formation, have no analytical solution.
These processes are governed by the initial concentrations of vacancies and
impurities.

If the impurity that traps vacancies is phosphorus, the limiting cases cor-
respond to low initial doping concentration (high resistivity, uncompensated
materials) and very high impurity concentration (low resistivity), respectively.
In both cases the equations could be decoupled, and analytical solutions are
possible.

So, if the formation of vacancy-impurity complexes is not so important, the
main process responsible for the decay of vacancy concentration is divacancy
production. In this case, the time evolution of the vacancy concentration is
described by the law:

V (t) =

1

4K7




−K8 + R

K8+4K7Vi

R

R

+ tanh(cid:16) tR
4 (cid:17)
tanh(cid:16) tR




(23)

6

where:

R ≡ qK8 (K8 + 8K7Vi)

while the increase of the divacancy concentration is given by:

V2 (t) =

Vi − V (t)

The stationary solution for V (t) is given by:

lim

t→∞

V (t) =

1

4K7

(R − K8)

(24)

(25)

(26)

For n-type high doped Si, the process described by eq. (4) is the most probable.
If J0 is the initial concentration of impurities, and the initial concentration of
complexes is zero, than:

−K6 + K5 (Vi − J0) + R∗

4 Results and physical interpretations

In Figure 1, the concentration of primary defects per unit ﬂuence (CPD)
induced by pions and protons in silicon is presented as a function of the kinetic
energy of the particle. For pions, the curves have been calculated in [9,10] and
proton data are from [11,12].

The diﬀerence between the two energy dependencies comes from the pecu-
liarities of the behaviour of pions and protons in the interaction with the
semiconductor material, and these are underlined in references [13,14]. The
process of partitioning the energy of the recoil nuclei (produced due the in-
teraction of the incident particle with the nucleus, placed in its lattice site)
in new interaction processes, between electrons (ionisation) and atomic mo-
tion (displacements) has been considered in the frame of the Lindhard theory.
The CPD for protons presents an abrupt decrease at low energies, followed by
a minimum and a plateau at higher energies. For pions, there exists a large
maximum in the energy range where the resonance is produced, followed by
a slight monotonic decrease at higher energies. Some local maxima are also
presents at high energies, but with less importance.

The CPD multiplied by the ﬂuence is the initial value of the concentration of
vacancies and interstitials, and in the forthcoming discussion it is expressed,
as speciﬁed, as atomic fraction.

The development of the model will be illustrated, without loss of generality,
on pions induced defects.

The diﬀerence between the activation energies Ei1 and Ei2 respectively justiﬁes
the introduction of two time scales, and the separate study of processes (1),
(2) and (4), (5) respectively.

In ﬁgure 2, the time evolution of the concentration of vacancies, intersti-
tials, divacances and vacancy-impurity complexes produced in silicon by 1015
pions/cm2 irradiation are presented as a function of the kinetic energy of the
particles. The following values of the parameters have been used: Ei1 = 0.4
eV, Ei2 = 0.8 eV, B1= 0.2 eV, B2 = 0.2 eV, B3 = 0.4 eV, ν = 1013 Hz, λ2 =
1015 cm2, α = 1010 cm−2, and all curves are calculated for the temperature T
= 293 K.

Figures 2a and 2b correspond to vacancy-interstitial annihilation and to in-

8

terstitial migration to sinks. A p=100 times decrease of the concentration of
interstitials conduces to a speciﬁed concentration of vacancies, Vi, that is the
initial concentration for the second step. The time scale of these processes is
of the order of the second.

Figures 2c and 2d correspond to divacancy formation by process (5) from the
vacancies remained after annihilation, in the case vacancy-impurity complex
formation is neglected.

The case of high initial impurity (phosphorus) concentration, where divacancy
formation is neglected in respect to complex formation, is presented in ﬁgures
2e and 2f respectively.

Some explicit considerations must be done about the formation of vacancy-
impurity complexes. The mechanisms supposed above can be used both for
boron and for phosphorus impurities. In this case, the corresponding processes
are [8]:

Bi + V → [Bi − V ]

(31)

and respectively:

Ps + V → [Ps − V ]

(32)

While the complex formed by boron is unstable and self anneals bellow room
temperature, the interaction between a V and a Ps leads to the formation of
an E centre which is stable in the same conditions.

Interactions between interstitial oxygen (another very studied impurity in the
last time) and free vacancies is described as a higher order process (third order
in the [8] and fourth power in [15]). If the process is stopped as a ﬁrst order
one, the time evolution of the concentrations is not diﬀerent from the case of
phosphorus, studied before.

If two or more impurities that trap vacancies are considered as existing si-
multaneously in silicon, the system of coupled equations must be solved. Only
numerical solutions for particular cases are possible.

Coming back to the ﬁrst step of the process, it is to note that the decrease
of vacancy concentration (for p = 100 diminish of interstitial concentration)
is much more important for higher initial vacancy concentrations. This idea

9

is illustrated in Figure 3, where the ratio V /V0 is represented as a function of
particle ﬂuence, for pions of 150 MeV kinetic energy. The weight of the anni-
hilation process in respect to interstitial migration to sinks increases abruptly
with the ﬂuence. At low and intermediate ﬂuences, up to 1014 pions/cm2, the
annihilation has a low importance. This curve is temperature independent.

On the other side, the characteristic time of the ﬁrst process step, correspond-
ing to a p=100 times decrease of interstitial concentration, is a function on
the initial vacancy concentration and on the temperature. Its dependence on
pion ﬂuence, for 150 MeV kinetic energy of pions, is represented in Figure 4,
for -20oC , 0oC and 20oC temperatures, respectively. It could be seen that, up
to 1016 pions/cm2, the characteristic time is independent on the ﬂuence, and
for higher ﬂuences a decrease of the characteristic time is to be noted and a
ﬂuence dependence is obtained.

The characteristic times for the diﬀerent processes estimated in this work are
in general agreement with the experimental data obtained by Z. Li and co-
workers [16] after neutron irradiated silicon. This way, due to the fact that the
characteristic times of diﬀerent physical process, a direct correspondence with
the microscopic mechanisms in the semiconductor material could be done.

Summary

The time evolution of the primary concentration of defects induced by hadrons
after irradiation process is modelled.

Vacancy-interstitial annihilation, interstitial migration to sinks, vacancy and
interstitial impurity complex formation as well as divacancy formation are
considered. Always it is possible to decouple the time evolution of impurity
concentrations into two steps, the ﬁrst one involving vacancy-interstitial an-
nihilation and interstitial migration to sinks, the second vacancy-complex and
divacancy formation.

The equations corresponding to the ﬁrst step are solved analytically for a wide
range of particle ﬂuences and for a wide energy range of incident particles, and
for diﬀerent temperatures: -20oC, 0oC and 20oC.

The approximations that permit to decouple the diﬀerential equations repre-
senting the time evolution processes in the second step have been studied, and
the processes have been treated separately. The concomitant consideration of
more processes in this last step is possible only numerically.

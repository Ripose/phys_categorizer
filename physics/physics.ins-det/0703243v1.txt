Abstract

∼

The International Linear Collider (ILC) Time Projection Chamber (TPC) trans-
verse space-point resolution goal is 100 µm for all tracks including stiﬀ 90◦ tracks
with the full
2 m drift. A Micro Pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) readout TPC
can achieve the target resolution with existing techniques using 1 mm or narrower
pads at the expense of increased detector cost and complexity. The new MPGD
readout technique of charge dispersion can achieve good resolution without resort-
ing to narrow pads. This has been demonstrated previously for 2 mm
6 mm pads
with GEMs and Micromegas in cosmic ray tests and in a KEK beam test in a 1 T
magnet. We have recently tested a Micromegas-TPC using the charge dispersion
readout concept in a high ﬁeld super-conducting magnet at DESY. The measured
Micromegas gain was found to be constant within 0.5 % for magnetic ﬁelds up to
5 T. With the strong suppression of transverse diﬀusion at high magnetic ﬁelds,
we measure a ﬂat 50 µm resolution at 5 T over the full 15 cm drift length of our
prototype TPC.

1 Introduction

The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [1] is a leading candidate for the central
tracker for future International Linear Collider (ILC). The ILC TPC resolution
goal is to measure 200 track points with a transverse resolution of about
100 µm for the full 2 m drift in a 4 T magnet. The resolution goal, near the
fundamental limit from statistics and transverse diﬀusion, cannot be achieved

E

B and track angle systematic eﬀects.

×

The recently developed Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD), such as the
Micromegas [2] and the GEM [3], have many advantages for the TPC readout.
The MPGD readout requires less mass for construction and it also naturally
suppresses the positive ion space charge build up in the drift volume. With the
B
narrow transverse diﬀusion width in a high magnetic ﬁeld and negligible E
and track angle eﬀects, the MPGD-TPC resolution can, in principle, be much
better than for the wire/pad-TPC. The traditional TPC could, however, still
measure the avalanche position along the wire accurately from the computed
centroid of signals induced on relatively wide cathode pads. For comparable
position measurement accuracy and only direct charge signals to work with,
the MPGD anode pads will need to be much narrower. This can signiﬁcantly
increase the MPGD-TPC readout channel count which may be diﬃcult to
manage for a large detector.

×

The new MPGD readout technique of charge dispersion enables one to use
wide pads again and still achieve good resolution. The principle of charge
dispersion and its application to MPGD-TPC readout has been described in
References [4,5]. In a nutshell, the conventional MPGD anode is replaced by
a high surface resistivity thin ﬁlm laminated to the readout pad plane with
an intermediate insulating spacer. The resistive surface forms a distributed
2-dimensional RC network with respect to the readout plane. The avalanche
charge cluster arriving at the anode disperses with the system RC time con-
stant. With the avalanche charge dispersing and covering a larger area with
time, wider pads can be used without loss of accuracy in charge centroid po-
sition determination.

The charge dispersion MPGD-TPC readout concept has been previously
demonstrated in cosmic ray tests without a magnetic ﬁeld and in a beam test
[6,7,8] at KEK in a 1 T magnet . Both the GEM and the Micromegas TPC
readout systems were tested and good resolution achieved with wide pads.
For zero drift distance, a resolution of 50 µm was achieved for 2 mm
6 mm
pads. Pad width was found no longer to be the resolution limiting factor. The
dependence of the measured resolution on the drift distance was close to the
expectation from transverse diﬀusion and electron statistics .

2 High ﬁeld cosmic ray TPC tests in the DESY 5 T magnet

We have recently tested a Micromegas-TPC prototype with charge dispersion
readout at the DESY super-conducting magnet test facility in magnetic ﬁelds
up to 5 T. Cosmic ray data were collected over a period of about four weeks.

The stability of gain as a function of magnetic ﬁeld was measured ﬁrst using
5.9 keV 55Fe x ray source. The Micromegas gain was found to be constant to
within 0.5 % for magnetic ﬁelds from 0 to 5 T (Fig. 1).

For cosmic ray resolution studies, pad signals were read out using ALEPH
wire TPC charge preampliﬁers and digitized directly without an intermediate
shaper ampliﬁer using 200 MHz 8 bit FADCs. Since charge dispersion pulses
are slow and signals were integrated over a few hundred ns during analysis,
slower 25 to 40 MHz FADCs would have been adequate.

Two diﬀerent gas mixtures were tested. The ﬁrst, Ar:iC4H10/95:5, was cho-
sen as reference to compare with our previous KEK measurements at 1 T.
The second, so called T2K gas, Ar:CF4:iC4H10/95:3:2, is a possible candi-
date for the ILC TPC. It has a high 73 µm/ns electron drift velocity at a
moderate 200 V/cm electric ﬁeld, a relatively low longitudinal diﬀusion of
20 at 5 T, which reduces transverse

diﬀusion to DTr ≃

248 µm/√cm, and a large ωτ

19 µm/√cm.

The transverse TPC resolution was measured at 5 T for both gases to bench-
mark TPC performance in a magnetic ﬁeld of strength comparable to that
for the ILC detector. For Ar:CF4iC4H10/95:3:2, resolution measurements were
also carried out at 0.5 T to measure the eﬀect of diﬀusion.

3 Cosmic ray resolution measurements in magnetic ﬁeld

The data analysis was carried out following procedure described previously
[6,7]. A subset of data was used for calibration and the remaining data used
to measure the resolution. The calibration data set was used to determine
the pad response function (PRF) and also to determine the bias correction.
The bias is a systematic error in the absolute position measurement. It is
attributed to point-to-point variations in the capacitance per unit area and
the surface resistivity for the anode RC structure. Since the bias is intrinsic to
the detector and does not change with time, a bias correction can be reliably
applied. An initial bias of up to 100 µm was observed. After the correction,
the bias remaining was small, about

A momentum cut has been applied to eliminate tracks with large angles with
respect to pads. The cut removed tracks with pT < 2 GeV/c at 5 T and pT <
0.3 GeV/c at 0.5 T. As in our previous work, the resolution measurements
reported below are for track angles

3.1 Resolution at 0.5 T as a function of gas gain

The resolution is given by the geometric mean of standard deviations of resid-
uals from track ﬁts done in two diﬀerent ways: including and excluding the row
of pads for which the resolution is being determined. The measured resolution
is shown in Fig. 2 for Ar:iC4H10/95:5 gas mixture as a function of the drift
distance z for two diﬀerent gains. The z dependence of resolution is given by:

where σ0 is the resolution at zero drift distance and DT r is the transverse
diﬀusion constant. Here Neﬀ is the eﬀective number of electrons over the
length of a pad. Neﬀ is not the average number of electrons, but is given
by: Neﬀ = 1/
, where N is the number of electrons following the Lan-
dau distribution and including the eﬀects of gas gain ﬂuctuations. Neﬀ was
obtained from the resolution ﬁt using the transverse diﬀusion constant DT r as
calculated by Magboltz [9].

ﬁeld of 0.5 T, the resolution was measured at two diﬀerent gas gains. The
TPC resolution was not compromised by the lower gain operation. The de-
pendence of resolution on drift distance was as expected from diﬀusion. These
measurements are signiﬁcantly better than has been previously achieved with
conventional direct charge MPGD-TPC readout techniques. The extrapolation
to the ILC TPC conditions is promising. With good control of systematics, a
TPC resolution better than 100 µm should be achievable over the entire

ABSTRACT

detector in Run
The Level-2 Silicon Track Trigger preprocessor (L2 STT) of the D
II is described.
It performs a precise reconstruction of charged particle tracks in
the Central Fiber Tracker (CFT) and the Silicon Microstrip Tracker (SMT). Events
with displaced tracks originating from the decay of long living particles such as B
hadrons are triggered on. The presence of b quarks contained in such hadrons is
relevant for B physics and crucial as signature of top quark and Higgs boson decays.

1 Introduction

In Run II the Fermilab Tevatron ¯pp collider operates at a center-of-mass energy
of √s = 1.96 TeV. To keep the rejection of background events while maintaining
high eﬃciency for physics processes of interest, the D
trigger had to be upgraded
and accommodated to the decreased beam crossing time of 132 ns which requires
minimized dead-time between collisions. The D
Silicon Track Trigger (STT) [1] is
the newest addition to this upgrade.

trigger and constitutes a preprocessor for the Silicon Microstrip Tracker (SMT).
The output of Level 2 preprocessors is sent to the third trigger level which applies
sophisticated reconstruction algorithms to the data. To maintain a dead-time below
ﬁve percent the mean decision time for the Level 2 trigger has to be kept below
100 µs subdivided in two halfs for the preprocessors and the global L2 decision.

The STT is fed with information from silicon strip detectors arranged in
four concentric layers in six cylindrical barrels around the beam axis (ﬁg. 1, left).
All detectors have axial 50 µm pitch strips (parallel to the beam line). The STT
subdivides the inputs from the barrel detectors into six independent azimuthal 60◦
sectors. In addition to the SMT information the STT receives up to 46 tracks per
sector each event from the Level 1 Central Track Trigger (CTT) which makes trigger
decisions on tracks from the Central Fiber Tracker (CFT).

The STT builds clusters from the SMT raw hits and deﬁnes

2 mm wide
roads around the Level 1 CTT tracks (ﬁg. 1, right). The CFT hits of the inner-
and outermost layers are used together with SMT clusters of at least three out of
four layers for the STT track ﬁtting. The determined track ﬁt parameters are sent
to the Level 2 CTT/STT trigger and to Level 3.

3 STT hardware design

The STT consists of six identical crates, each covering two neighbored 30◦ azimuthal
SMT sectors (ﬁg. 1, left). A crate caries an input output controller (IOC) to operate
the crate, a single board computer (SBC) for Level 3 data submission and twelve
custom-designed VME boards with programmable processors and daughter boards.

The STT motherboard is a 9U

400 mm VME64x-compatible card con-
×
taining three 33 MHz PCI busses to communicate between the logic daughter board
(either a Fiber Road Card (FRC), a Silicon Trigger Card (STC) or a Track Fit Card
(TFC)), serial link boards and the data buﬀer controller (BC) board.

The FRC consists of four functional elements which are a trigger receiver
which communicates with the trigger framework bidirectional, a road receiver which
receives tracks from the L1 CTT trigger, a trigger/road data formatter which com-
bines the road and trigger framework information and a buﬀer manager which con-
trols the buﬀering and readout to Level 3.

The STC receives raw hits from the SMT barrel detectors. Bad strips
are masked and pedestal/gain corrections are applied via Look-Up-Tables (LUT).
Adjacent SMT hits are clustered. Clusters of axial strip detectors are matched to
roads around CFT tracks via LUT’s and sent to the Track Fit Card (TFC).

The TFC performs the ﬁnal cluster ﬁltering (closest cluster to road center)

and two dimensional linearized track ﬁtting of the form

φ(r) = b/r + κr + φ0

(1)

where r is the radial distance from the beam spot position to the cluster, φ its
azimuth, b the impact parameter, κ the track curvature and φ0 its direction at the
point of closest approach. The ﬁt is performed with help of precomputed matrix
elements stored in LUT’s exploiting two CFT hits in addition to the SMT clusters.

4 Performance

The impact parameter of the STT integrated over all track transverse momenta has
been measured to be 67 µm (ﬁg. 2, left, preliminary) including the beam spot size

obtained oﬄine.

The measured impact parameter resolution of the STT as a function of
track transverse momentum (ﬁg. 2, center, preliminary) increases towards lower
track transverse momenta due to multiple Coulomb scattering. The ﬁt function

IP = qA2 + (B/p⊥)2

(2)

has been used.

Fig. 2 (right) shows a monitoring plot with the impact parameter signif-
icance distribution of the STT. The red curve is a reference histogram, the black
dots are data. In the present test trigger a cut on events with at least one track
with impact parameter signiﬁcance above +3 has been implemented.

5 Conclusions

The STT measures impact parameters of tracks and their signiﬁcance which allows
to select large samples of events containing long living particles such as B hadrons
in the presence of enormous background through triggering on displaced tracks.
Presently the STT operates as a test trigger during data taking and will be fully
commissioned with the next revision (V14) of the D

trigger list.

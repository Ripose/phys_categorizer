Abstract

The performance of the 200 × 2.5 × 1 cm3 plastic scintillator strip with wavelength
shifting ﬁber read-out by two novel photodetectors called Silicon PhotoMultipliers
(SiPMs) is discussed. The advantages of SiPM relative to the traditional multichan-
nel photomultiplier are shown. Light yield and light attenuation measurements are
presented. This technique can be used in muon or calorimeter systems in which
tracking information is also required.

The detection of charged particles with plastic scintillators, wavelength shift-
ing (WLS) ﬁbers and multichannel photomultipliers is a well known, eﬃcient
and robust technique (see, e.g. [1]). However it has severe limitations. First,
photomultipliers can not work in the magnetic ﬁeld. For scintillator counters
inside a magnet one should bring the light out of it by clear ﬁbers. This com-
plexiﬁes the detector and leads to some light losses. Second, ﬁbers from diﬀer-
ent scintillator counters should be assembled together in a bundle attached to
the multichannel photomultiplier. This is not always easy to arrange. Finally,
calibration and monitoring of a multichannel photomultiplier is not a simple
task.

In this work performed at ITEP (Moscow) we use the novel photodetector
called Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) [2] instead of the traditional photomul-
tiplier. It is the matrix of 1024 = 32×32 tiny independent silicon photodiode

pixels placed in the area of 1×1 mm2 and working in a Geiger mode. Each
diode has its own quenching resistor of the order of a few hundred kΩ. The
characteristics of individual pixels and their discharge signals are almost the
same. A typical ampliﬁcation which depends on the applied voltage is of the
order of 106. The signals from all pixels are intrinsically summed up. The total
SiPM response is thus proportional to the number of incident photons as long
as there is no saturation, i.e. the number of ﬁred pixels is small in comparison
with the total number of pixels in the SiPM (1024 in our case 1 ). The photode-
tection eﬃciency depends on the light wave length and the applied voltage.
Typical values are around ≈10–15%. Thus SiPM and traditional photomulti-
pliers have similar gain and eﬃciency. However, SiPM is approximately twice
cheaper than one channel in the multichannel photomultiplier. In addition it
can work in the magnetic ﬁeld, so there is no need in the clear ﬁbers. SiPM is
so tiny that can be mounted directly on the detector without eﬃciency loss.
We install two SiPMs at the scintillator strip ends (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The layout of the test bench (not in scale). The sizes are in mm.

The scintillator strip is produced in Vladimir (Russia) by the extrusion tech-
nique from the granulated polystyrene with two dyes (1.5% of PTP and 0.01%
POPOP). Its sizes are 200 × 2.5 × 1 cm3. The Kuraray multiclading WLS ﬁber
Y11 (200) with 1 mm diameter is put in the 2.5 mm deep groove. To enlarge
the light output, the strip is wrapped in the Superradiant VN2000 foil pro-
duced by the 3M company. No gluing is used to attach the WLS ﬁber to the
SiPM or to the strip. There is about 200 µm air gap between the ﬁber end
and the SiPM to ensure that the ﬁber can not scratch the SiPM surface.

We use the cosmic particle trigger consisted of a pair of 2.3×2.5 cm2 scintillator
counters placed above and below the strip (see Fig. 1). The SiPM spectra like
the one shown in Fig. 2a, are obtained for diﬀerent positions of the trigger
counters along the strip.

1 SiPMs can be produced with diﬀerent number of pixels in the range 500–3000.

Fig. 2. SiPM ADC spectra. (a): Typical SiPM response to cosmic particles. The
dashed line shows the ﬁt of the peak central region to the Gaussian distribution.
(b): The same SiPM is illuminated by the LED light, (c): the same as (b) but for
another SiPM produced recently with improved technology. The ﬁt curve is described
in detail in Appendix A.

In each case the region around the peak is ﬁt to the Gaussian distribution as
shown in Fig. 2a. The central value of the Gaussian is transformed into the
average number of ﬁred SiPM pixels using the SiPM gain determined in the
following way. The strip is illuminated periodically by the short ﬂashes of the
Light Emitting Diode (LED). The corresponding SiPM response spectrum
shown in Fig. 2b is collected in parallel to the cosmic ray data. The LED
ﬂash is chosen in such a way that each time only a few SiPM pixels are ﬁred.
Since the signals from diﬀerent pixels are very similar, one can see clear peaks
corresponding to diﬀerent number of ﬁred pixels. The distance between the
peaks thus measures the SiPM gain. For larger number of incident photons
like in Fig. 2a the individual peaks become smeared.

The cosmic particles selected by the two trigger counters are not strictly ver-
tical. Thus they produce slightly more scintillation light than the minimum
ionizing particle at normal incidence to the strip. To correct for this eﬀect,

3

we made a simple simulation assuming that the angular distribution of all
cosmic particles coincided with the one of cosmic muons and had the form
cos2 θ where θ was the angle with respect to the vertical direction [3]. In this
way it was found that in average the path length of triggered particles inside
the scintillator was 1.1×1 cm, i.e. 1.1 times larger than the strip thickness.
Assuming that the light yield was also 10% larger, all experimental numbers
were divided by 1.1.

There is another eﬀect which should be taken into account in determining
the light yield. The procedure described above allows to measure the average
number of ﬁred SiPM pixels. It is not equal to the number of detected photons.
One photon can ﬁre more than one pixel due to the SiPM interpixel “cross
talk”. This eﬀect increases with the applied voltage. In our case the average
number of pixels ﬁred by one initial photoelectron is about 1.43 for the left
SiPM and 1.28 for the right one. It is determined from the ﬁt of the spectrum
in Fig. 2b described in detail in Appendix A. The “cross talk” is found from
the deviation of the distribution of the number of ﬁred pixels from the Poisson
law. After correction for the “cross talk” eﬀect, the resulting average number
of detected photons measured from each strip end is shown in Fig. 3 by ﬁlled
triangles and open squares for diﬀerent positions of the trigger counters. One
can see that for the 2 m strip the attenuation at the far end is about 50%.
The upper points in Fig. 3 show the sum of two SiPM signals. It is uniform
within ±13%. In the worst case when the particle passes through the strip
center there are more than 13 detected photons. In case of Poisson statistics
this corresponds to 98% eﬃciency at the threshold ≥ 7 photons or ≥ 8 ﬁred
pixels. With this requirement the eﬃciency averaged over the strip exceeds
99%.

These eﬃciency estimations can be also checked with the data. The distribu-
tion of the number of pixels ﬁred in two SiPMs by a cosmic particle is shown
in Fig. 4. Top and bottom spectra correspond to two extreme cases when the
particle passes through the end or the center of the strip. A few events around
zero belong to the pedestal which appears here due to imperfectness of the
trigger. The plots are not corrected for the factor 1.1 which was introduced
above to take into account not normal incidence of cosmic particles. Therefore
to estimate the ineﬃciency of the requirement to have ≥ 8 ﬁred pixels for nor-
mal incidence one should count the entries between the pedestal and the value
8 · 1.1 ≈ 9. This part of the spectrum is hatched. There are 11 such events
on the top plot. They correspond to 1.7% of ineﬃciency which agrees with
the calculations above. The ineﬃciency averaged over all other positions of
trigger counters along the strip is found to be 0.7%. Note that in determining
the light yield in Fig. 3 the position of the peak center in the signal amplitude
spectrum is used. It is lower than the mean value of the histogram. E.g. for
the strip center the mean value of the top spectrum in Fig. 4 is equal to 24.5
while the peak center is at 20.7 ﬁred pixels.

Fig. 3. Average number of photons detected by SiPM for normally incident cosmic
ray particle versus the position of the trigger counters along the strip. The upper
curve (ﬁlled circles) is the sum of the two lower curves which correspond to the left
(ﬁlled triangles) and right (open squares) SiPMs.

The typical SiPM noise rate recorded without any trigger exponentially de-
pends on the threshold (see Fig. 5). With the lowest threshold corresponding
to one half of the SiPM pixel signal it is about 2 MHz at room temperature.
The rate of two SiPMs put in the coincidence depends on the type of the
electronics. For example one can simply set the threshold for the sum of two
SiPM signals integrated during the same 120 nsec time interval which is used
in obtaining the amplitude spectra in Fig. 4. The probability to get in this
way ≥ 8 ﬁred pixels due to noise is measured to be 7 · 10−4. Clearly it can
be suppressed even further if the electronics utilizes the fact that two SiPM
signals caused by real particles are closer in time than 120 nsec. To estimate
the noise rate dependence on the time window we made a simple simulation.
The distribution in Fig. 5 was diﬀerentiated to get the amplitude spectrum of
one SiPM noise signal. The number of signals within the given time window
was allowed to ﬂuctuate according to the Poisson statistics. In this way for
120 nsec window the probability to get ≥ 8 ﬁred pixels was found to be 1·10−4
instead of 7 · 10−4 in data. The discrepancy may indicate the presence of the
unknown extra source of background in our cosmic ray setup. For 50 nsec time
window the probability in the simulation was found to be 1.1 · 10−5, i.e. about
an order of magnitude lower than that for 120 nsec. Thus it is possible to
reduce drastically the noise rate by using shorter gate.

In conclusion, the detector consisting of the 200 × 2.5 × 1 cm3 plastic scintil-
lator strip, the wavelength shifting ﬁber and two novel photodetectors called
Silicon PhotoMultipliers has been constructed and tested. A possibility to use
such a new technique in the muon systems or calorimeters with tracking in-
formation has been demonstrated. For example it can be used in the muon
system of the future International Linear Collider detector. SiPM has similar
gain and eﬃciency as the traditional multichannel photomultiplier. It also has
several advantages. There is no need to use clear ﬁbers to bring the light out
of the magnetic ﬁeld or to arrange many ﬁbers in one bundle attached to the
multichannel photomultiplier. SiPM can be mounted directly on the strip end.
Its gain can be determined easily by observing the peaks corresponding to dif-
ferent number of ﬁred SiPM pixels (see Fig. 2b,c). Finally it is approximately
twice cheaper than one channel in multichannel photomultiplier. Light yield
and light attenuation measurements are shown in Fig. 3. The light yield of

more than 13 detected photons per cosmic ray particle at normal incidence is
obtained. The light collection eﬃciency can be further increased by gluing the
WLS ﬁber to the strip. We plan to study this possibility systematically in the
future.

A The ﬁt procedure of the SiPM calibration spectrum

To calibrate the SiPM, it is illuminated by the LED ﬂashes. The corresponding
ADC spectrum of one of the SiPMs is shown in Fig. 2b. This histogram is ﬁt
to the convolution of the pedestal spectrum (B) obtained when the LED is
oﬀ and the SiPM response function (L) to the photons from LED which will
be described later. Thus its Fourier transform which will be denoted in the
following by F superscript can be written as BFLF. Assuming the stability of
LED and the pure Poisson distribution of photons detected by SiPM, LF can
be written as

LF =

+∞

X
n=0

e−µµn
n!

(P F)n = exp{µ(P F − 1)},

7

where P F is the Fourier transform of the response to exactly one photon, µ is
the average number of photons detected by the SiPM. We use the fact that the
response to n photons is n convolutions of P and thus has a Fourier transform
(P F)n. Due to the interpixel cross-talk one photon can ﬁre more than one
pixel. To describe this eﬀect we approximate P F by

P F =

GF + ǫ(GF)2 + ǫ2(GF)3 + . . . + ǫk−1(GF)k + . . .
1 + ǫ + ǫ2 + . . . + ǫk−1 + . . .

= GF 1 − ǫ

1 − ǫGF ,

where ǫ describes the amount of cross-talk, GF is the Fourier transform of
the SiPM signal distribution when exactly one random pixel in it is ﬁred. The
average number of pixels ﬁred by one photon is 1/(1−ǫ). As an approximation
of G the Gaussian distribution is taken. Its sigma (σ), mean (∆) and also the
cross-talk (ǫ) are the only ﬁt parameters. ∆ is equal to the distance between
adjacent peaks in Fig. 2a. The number of photons µ is constrained in the ﬁt
by the condition that the average of the histogram in Fig. 2a should be equal
to the average of the background histogram B plus the average of L which
is ∆µ/(1 − ǫ). Here we assume that the averages of experimental histograms
when LED is on and oﬀ are known accurately and do not ﬂuctuate.

If G and B functions are normalized so that they have unit integrals, the
resulting formula for the Fourier transform of the ﬁt function is

N · BF exp{µ

GF − 1
1 − ǫGF },

where N is the total number of entries in the histogram. It is found that such
a ﬁt with 3 parameters can describe large variety of LED spectra for diﬀerent
SiPMs, bias voltages and LED intensities.

Due to improvements in production, the diﬀerences between individual pixel
signals inside the SiPMs produced recently became smaller. Fig. 2c shows one
typical example. The separation between the peaks is much clearer.

CALICE Si/W electromagnetic calorimeter prototype, ﬁrst testbeam results

A highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter prototype based on tungsten absorber and sampling units equipped
with silicon pads as sensitive devices for signal collection is under construction. The full prototype will have in total
30 layers and be read out by about 10000 Si cells of 1 × 1 cm2. A ﬁrst module consisting of 14 layers and depth of
7.2 X0 at normal incidence, having in total 3024 channels of 1 cm2, was tested recently with e− beam. We describe
the prototype and discuss some preliminary testbeam results.

1. GENERAL

An experiment at the e+e− Future Linear Collider with 0.5 - 1 TeV center-of-mass energy range must be capable
to perform high precision measurements in order to exploit the physics potential of the machine. This fact sets strict
requirements on performance of vertex, tracking and calorimetric detectors. The CALICE Collaboration [1] has been
formed to conduct the research and development eﬀort needed to bring initial conceptual designs for the calorimetry
to a ﬁnal proposal suitable for an experiment at the Future Linear Collider.

The main proposal is that both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters should be highly granular to allow very
eﬃcient pattern recognition for excellent shower separation and particle identiﬁcation within jets and subsequently
to provide excellent jet reconstruction eﬃciency [2]. This concept, also known as “particle ﬂow paradigm”, to be
successful requires optimal interplay between hardware, i.e. granularity, and software, i.e. reconstruction algorithms.
CALICE plans include studies of both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter prototypes. The electromagnetic
prototype is a sampling calorimeter with W absorber and Si pads as sensitive material. There are two main diﬀerent
hadronic prototype concepts under study both based on steel absorber. One has scintillator tiles and conventional
analogue readout scheme, while the other is envisaged to be equipped with resistive plate chambers or GEMs and
have digital readout [2].

Combined and individual testbeam studies are planned that will allow us to debug technology/detector concept(s),
to perform detector characterisation, to test the “particle ﬂow paradigm” and the interplay between hardware and
software, and also to test-validate-improve available simulation codes and shower packages [3].

The Si/W ECAL prototype and ﬁrst testbeam results are discussed here.

2. Si/W ECAL PROTOTYPE

The Si/W electromagnetic prototype is a sampling calorimeter with high granularity, in both transverse and
longitudinal direction. The full detector is longitudinally segmented into 30 layers of W interleaved with 0.5 mm
thick Si pads as sensitive material. The W layers have varying thickness, the ﬁrst 10 layers are 1.4 mm thick each,
2.8 mm in the next 10 and 4.2 mm in the ﬁnal 10. The total depth of the detector is about 24 X0 at normal
incidence, and has an active face with an area of 18 × 18 cm2. It is read out in 1 × 1 cm2 cells and in total there
are 9720 channels arranged in 270 wafers each consisting of a 6 × 6 cell matrix. A schematic of the full prototype is
given in Figure 1 which illustrates more clearly the actual construction. The layers are arranged in slabs with their

supporting structure consisting of H-shaped W sheet wrapped with a carbon ﬁber layer. On each side of the W sheet
of the slabs PCB’s are put on which the Si wafers are glued. Then each slab is shielded with aluminum foil. This
construction introduces odd/even layer asymmetry, which contributes to diﬀerence in layer response at a few percent
level, since showering particles pass through alternately diﬀerent material budget before its signal is sampled, namely
W-Al-Si-PCB for the odd layers and W-PCB-Si-Al for the even layers.

3. FIRST TESTBEAM RESULTS

A structure of 10 layers with in total 60 wafers and 2160 channels was calibrated in a cosmic testbench at Ecole
Polytechnique in Paris, France. About 1 · 106 cosmic triggers were recorded during December 2004. These data
allowed the calibration constants of these channels to be determined to 1% level of accuracy which is suﬃcient for
the current phase of studies.

A typical channel is shown in Figure 2(a), the pedestal and the mip signal are clearly separated and have Gaussian
and Landau shape, respectively, as expected. A signal over noise ratio of about 8.5 was observed with a variation
among the channels of about 6%, as can be seen in Figure 2(b). Figure 2(c) shows the distribution of the mip peak
for the channels. One should note how narrow the distribution is, with a spread, as expressed by the sigma/mean,
of 3%. This intercalibration spread is coming from the variation of the wafer thickness which is 3% as given by the
wafer suppliers. Construction and material inhomogeneity contribute to the constant term of energy resolution and
is a common source of performance degradation. To be able to determine and to correct for these inhomogeneities
eﬀects due to production tolerance is one of the key advantages of Si being used for calorimetric detectors. Since Si
show relatively stable properties along time and with respect to temperature variation less frequent monitoring and
calibration dedicated eﬀort will be required for a Si based calorimeter.

A so-called “30%” equipped Si/W prototype was shipped to DESY in Hamburg, Germany, and was tested with
electrons during January-February 2005. The prototype consists of 14 W layers, the ﬁrst 10 are 1.4 mm thick each
and the last 4 at 2.8 mm, interleaved with 18 × 12 matrix of active Si cells 1 × 1 cm2 each. In total the detector
has 3024 channels and measures about 7.2 X0 at normal incidence.

Figure 3: Testbeam layout at DESY, it consists of the prototype detector, three scintillation counters to provide the trigger
signal and four drift chambers to perform the tracking of incoming particles (the drift chambers and their installation are
courtesy of Tsukuba University and Kobe University, Japan).

The testbeam layout is shown in Figure 3. Three scintillation counters are used to provide the trigger signal and
there are also four drift chambers which perform the tracking of the incoming particles. The calorimeter protoype
was put on top of a moving table which allowed horizontal and vertical displacement with respect to beam. Data
at several conﬁgurations of position × energy × angle were taken. We performed position scans at center - edge -
corner of wafers, with electron beam mainly at 1, 2, 3 GeV, and with some runs at 4, 5 and 6 GeV, and with detector
tilted with respect to the beam direction at 0◦, 10◦, 20◦ and 30◦. In total about 25 · 106 trigger events were recorded.
Some preliminary results are reported in the following.

A typical event is displayed in Figure 4 where the cells hit with signal above a threshold of 0.5 mip are shown.
This illustrates clearly the concept of “tracking calorimetry”, the high granularity of the calorimeter allows to record
the development of the shower along both transverse and longitudinal direction and to reconstruct it in a tracking
manner, i.e. both calorimetric and tracking information are provided.

The total signal recorded as a function of the cell threshold applied is shown in Figure 5. A threshold around
0.5 - 0.6 mip seems to be a safe limit in order to suppress noise suﬃciently. The results following are with a cell
threshold of 0.5 mip being applied.

Figure 6 shows the detector response to incident electrons with energy of 1, 2 and 3 GeV in terms of total number
of cells above 0.5 mip threshold (left column) or total energy deposited (right column). The upper and lower row of

plots correspond to prototype being at 0◦ and 30◦ angle with respect to beam direction, respectively. The prototype
is not long enough to contain the showers and therefore its response shows poor linearity. Better containment is
achieved at 30◦ as can be seen also in Figure 7 which depicts the longitudinal development of the showers. The
odd/even layer response asymmetry due to construction is observed.

Several position scans along the wafers and their borders were performed to investigate the response homogeneity.

borders is clearly seen. Figures 8(b) and (c) are the corresponding projections along the horizontal and the vertical
direction. The alternate layers of the detector are staggered horizontally, but not vertically. Therefore, as observed,
the dip is shallower and wider in the former case, and deeper and narrower in the latter one.

Similar studies are under way for general debugging and understanding of the system before the next testbeam

We discussed the CALICE Si/W ECAL prototype and some ﬁrst results from a recent testbeam. A prototype with
14 layers and depth of 7.2 X0 at normal incidence, having in total 3024 channels of 1 × 1 cm2 Si pads, was tested
at DESY with e− beam. The testbeam progressed very smoothly and a lot of data were collected that will allow us
to perform a thorough debugging of the system. Analysis studies are in progress in order to understand the detector
before the next round of testbeams. The next testbeam is planned for summer 2005 with the prototype structure
equipped with more layers and channels.

On behalf of the ECAL group the author wish to thank the CALICE-HCAL group at DESY for their support and

contribution to the success of the testbeam.

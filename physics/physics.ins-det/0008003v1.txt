Abstract

The design of a detector based on MICROMEGAS (MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure)
technology is presented. Our detector is characterized by a large active area of 398×281
mm2, a pad read-out with 20×22 mm2 segmentation, and an uniform ampliﬁcation gap
obtained by insulating spacers (100 µm high and 200 µm in diameter). The performances of
several prototypes have been evaluated under irradiation with secondary beams of 2 GeV/c
momentum charged pions and electrons. We consider such a detector as the basic element for
a pre-shower detector to equip the PHOton Spectrometer (PHOS) of the ALICE experiment.
Its assets are modularity, small amount of material, robustness and low cost.

I. INTRODUCTION

The main goal of experiments at relativistic heavy-ion colliders, like RHIC at Brookhaven
and LHC at CERN, is to produce and study, in the laboratory, the primordial matter of
the universe which is predicted to consist of a plasma of deconﬁned quarks and gluons
(QGP). Among the various considered probes and related observables (strange hadrons,
heavy mesons, di-electrons, etc.), direct photons will explore the partonic phase during the
equilibration process, as well as the QGP phase itself [1–3]. In the ALICE (A Large Ion
Collider Experiment) experiment at CERN [4], direct photons will be detected and identi-
ﬁed with PHOS (PHOton Spectrometer) [5]. PHOS is a highly segmented electromagnetic
calorimeter (EMCA) which will consist of 17280 lead-tungstate (PbWO4) crystals, associ-
ated to a charged particle veto detector (CPV). Each crystal (2.2×2.2×18 cm3, 20 radiation
lengths) is coupled to a PIN-diode associated to a low noise pre-ampliﬁer. The PHOS spec-
trometer will be positioned at the bottom of the ALICE magnet, 4.6 meters away from
the interaction point.
It will cover the pseudo-rapidity range from -0.12 to 0.12 and the
azimuthal-angle domain from 45◦ to 135◦. Rejection of charged hadronic showers will be
performed with the CPV detector, positioned in front of the PHOS crystals.

Recent analyses of the direct photon production in heavy-ion collisions at SPS energies
[2,3,6] have pointed out the limits of the photon identiﬁcation power resulting from two

kinds of contaminations: i) the showers induced by neutral hadrons (mainly n and ¯n), and
ii) the overlap of showers in high multiplicity events. These contaminations are expected to
become much more severe at LHC energies. In order to properly minimize these eﬀects, we
have designed a pre-shower detector to be associated with PHOS. This detector noticeably
improves the photon identiﬁcation power and allows for a direct measurement of the elec-
tromagnetic shower vertex. The PPSD (PHOS Pre-Shower Detector, Fig. 1) consists of two
distinct MICROMEGAS (MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure) gas counters: the Charged
Particle Veto (CPV) and the Photon Conversion (PC) chambers, sandwiching a passive Pb
converter.

Among the new micro-pattern detectors exploiting avalanche multiplication in narrow
gaps [9], MICROMEGAS technology [10] appears as a very promising option in terms of
performances, robustness, reduced amount of material, and cost (see e.g. [11–16]). For our
speciﬁc needs, we justify the choice of the MICROMEGAS technology with the following
considerations:

1. It provides the modularity well suited to cover areas of a few squared meters.

2. It is mechanically robust and resistant to electrical discharges.

3. The small lateral development of the electron cloud in the ampliﬁcation gap, prevents

from signiﬁcant overlaps in high multiplicity events.

4. The small amount of material minimizes photon-conversion and nuclear interactions

within the detector.

Using our PPSD design, the identiﬁcation capabilities of PHOS will be improved as

follows:

1. Muons will be identiﬁed as minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) in the CPV, PC and

EMCA detectors.

2. About half of the charged hadrons (π+, π−, K+, K−, etc.) will be detected as MIPs in
the CPV, the PC, and the calorimeter. The other half of charged hadrons will develop
a hadronic shower in the calorimeter.

3. Photons will be unambiguously identiﬁed by three features: the absence of a hit in
− e− pair
the CPV, a hit in the PC detector, when the photon is converted into an e+
within the absorber, and an electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter. The identiﬁ-
cation eﬃciency will depend on the thickness of the passive converter. The optimal
thickness results from a compromise between the photon identiﬁcation eﬃciency of the
PPSD and the photon energy resolution of the spectrometer. From simulations [7],
we deduced that the best trade-oﬀ is achieved for a thickness equivalent to one radia-
tion length. Additionally, from the hit position in the PC detector, the shower vertex
will be directly measured, providing information to resolve the overlapping showers
expected in high multiplicity events.

4. Neutral hadrons will trigger most of the time nor the CPV, neither the PC detector
(the intermediate Pb passive converter represents only 5% of the nuclear interaction
length).

5. Electrons and positrons will be identiﬁed by a hit in the CPV and PC and by an
electromagnetic shower developing in the EMCA. Additional improvement of the elec-
tron and positron identiﬁcation power could be achieved by considering the deposited
energy in the PC detector.

In the present report, the performances of large-area anode-pad MICROMEGAS de-
tectors, irradiated with a 2 GeV/c pion and electron beam, are presented in terms of pad
response to MIP, gain in the ampliﬁcation gap and detector eﬃciency. In addition, we have
studied the electrical discharge probability per ionizing particle as a function of the detector
gain, in order to probe the reliability of this technology in large multiplicity experiments.
Finally, we have studied the electron and pion response functions of a pre-shower detector
prototype.

II. DESCRIPTION OF A LARGE-AREA ANODE-PAD MICROMEGAS

CHAMBERS

The MICROMEGAS technology [10,11] consists of an asymmetric two-stage parallel-
plate gas-detector. The ﬁrst stage, a 3 mm thick conversion gap, is separated from the
100 µm thick ampliﬁcation gap, by a micro-mesh foil resting on insulating spacers. The
ampliﬁcation gap is closed at the bottom by the pad anode surface. Such a conﬁguration
allows to establish simultaneously a very high electric ﬁeld in the ampliﬁcation region (∼
50 kV/cm) together with a low electric ﬁeld in the drift region (∼ 2 kV/cm), by apply-
ing suitable voltages between the three electrodes (cathode-mesh-anode). When a charged
particle traverses the conversion gap, it generates primary electrons which are subsequently
multiplied in the small ampliﬁcation gap. The associated ion cloud is quickly collected on
the micro-mesh layer generating a relatively fast signal, whereas only a small part of the ion
cloud penetrates into the conversion region. The ampliﬁed electron cloud is collected on the
anode providing a fast electric signal.

Based on this principle, we have developed several large-area prototypes with pad read-

out (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The characteristics of the chambers are the following:

1. Anode: The total area of the anode plane is 480 × 300 mm2, providing an active
area of 398 × 281 mm2. The anode electrode consists of a 1.0 mm thick printed circuit
board. Its inner surface is segmented in rectangular 20 × 22 mm2 gilded copper pads,
and the signal is collected on the other side through strips to the connectors. The
inter-pad width is 100 µm and the total number of pads is 256. Each pad is pierced by
a conductive pine hole of 300 µm in diameter to allow for readout through the board.
The rigidity of the board is obtained by sticking an additional 3 mm thick board made
of low X0 composite material (EPOXY glass and ROHACELL). To keep the small
ampliﬁcation gap as uniform as possible, well-calibrated micro-spacers (100 µm high
and 200 µm in diameter) are deposited on the pads with a pitch of 2 mm in both
directions.

2. Cathode: The cathode consists of a 9 µm gilded copper layer, glued on a 3 mm
thick plate made of composite material and sandwiched between two 300 µm thick

3

GI180 boards. The top cathode plane is glued to a 6 mm thick Plexiglas frame of
410 × 294 mm2.

3. Mesh: The original electro-formed micro-mesh1 consists of a 3 µm thick grid of
22”×22” made of pure Ni. The 39 µm squared holes grid are outlined by a 11 µm
thick border of Ni in steps of 50 µm, i.e. 500 LPI (“Lines Per Inch”). The optical
transparency reaches 59%. The micro-mesh is stretched on the Plexiglas frame which
deﬁnes the 3 mm thick conversion gap between the micro-mesh and the cathode plane.

4. The micro-mesh and cathode assembly is placed on top of the micro-spacers of the
anode plane. A 2 mm thick composite-material top-lid covers the whole system to
ensure the gas tightness of the chamber.

5. The gas mixture ﬂows through the detector at a pressure slightly above atmospheric

pressure.

6. The signals of the individual pads are collected, through the metallic hole, at the
backplane of the anode plane by individual strips and transported to the front-end
electronics located on the two opposite sides of the detector.

7. The total thickness of the detector throughout the active detection area, is 13 mm

corresponding to 1.76% of X0.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP FOR THE BEAM TESTS

Our prototype of the PPSD detector was tested in the T10 hall at CERN (Fig. 4) The
choice of the gas mixture during the experiment was Ar + 10% iC4H10 (isobutane). The
voltage of the drift zone was ﬁxed to HVdrif t = -1000 V. The basic elements of this test
experiment were:

1. Beam. The PS accelerator at CERN delivered a secondary beam of 2 GeV/c momen-
tum. This beam consisted of hadrons (∼ 60%, mainly charged pions) and leptons (∼
40%, mainly electrons). The size of the beam ”spot” was about 10 cm in diameter and
the spill duration was 1 s with an inter-spill time of 9 s. The beam intensity stayed in
the range of 103 to 105 particles per spill.

2. Beam identiﬁcation. Two Cherenkov detectors C1 and C2 were placed upstream of
the detector to identify the impinging particles. However, only C2 (ﬁlled with CO2 at
atmospheric pressure) allowed a discrimination between hadrons and leptons.

3. Trigger. Two plastic scintillators (Pl1 and Pl2) with a square shape of 10×10 cm2
were inserted along the beam line (Fig. 4) to deﬁne the main trigger of the acquisi-
tion. Coincidences between Pl1 and Pl2 deﬁned a wide beam trigger. A small plastic
scintillator Pl3 (1×1 cm2) was also included in the trigger electronics during some runs

to deﬁne a narrow beam trigger. It was used to measure the MICROMEGAS detector
eﬃciency and the background induced by the passive converter.

4. MICROMEGAS detectors. Two MICROMEGAS detector prototypes were placed
upstream and downstream with respect to the passive converter. Ampliﬁcation of the
pad signal was performed by GASSIPLEX based electronics [20]. The elemental elec-
tronics card consisted of 3 GASSIPLEX chips serving 16 channels each. These cards
(6 cards per detector) were directly attached to the detector board. The GASSIPLEX
sequential signal was digitized by the CAEN V550 VME ADC (up to 1024 channels).
Operations on the GASSIPLEX and the V550 module were synchronized via a CAEN
V551A VME sequencer.

5. Passive Converter. During a few runs, a passive lead converter, 6 mm thick, covering

an area of 10×10 cm2 was placed in between the two MICROMEGAS chambers.

6. PHOS array. An array of 8×8 PHOS type crystals was also placed at the end of
the beam line but not used in our investigation. It is mentioned here for the sake of
completeness.

IV. DETECTOR PERFORMANCES

The charge distribution collected by a single pad (Fig. 5) of the MICROMEGAS chamber

when considering the wide beam trigger, exhibits two components:

• For low amplitudes (50 mV) the intrinsic electronic noise of the pad exhibits a peaked
Gaussian distribution. This corresponds to events in which beam particles ﬁre the
wide beam trigger and hit one of the neighboring pads. The mean of the Gaussian
distribution, MG, results from the intrinsic noise or pedestal. The width expressed
as the standard deviation of the distribution, σG, results from the pad intrinsic elec-
tronic noise, which depends on the capacitance of the pad and on the electromagnetic
environment.

• At larger amplitudes, one observes the detector response to ionizing particles which
exhibits the usual Landau distribution reﬂecting the ﬂuctuations in the number of
primary electrons created in the thin drift region. For a 3 mm gap ﬁlled with Ar+10%
isobutane at atmospheric pressure, on average, about 34 electrons per MIP are cre-
ated. The maximum of the Landau distribution, ML, reﬂects the gain achieved in the
ampliﬁcation zone and its width the average number of primary electrons (a smaller
average number of primary electrons leading to larger ﬂuctuations).

The correlated noise, a noise level common to all pad signals, adds to the intrinsic noise of
a pad. It can be removed on an event-by-event basis. We deﬁned this noise as

Cn =

1

Npad

Npad
X

Si

|Si|<3σGi

5

(1)

where Npad is the number of pads with a collected charge lower than 3 times the width of
the noise. After removal of this correlated noise (Fig. 5b), the charge distribution exhibits a
much narrower noise peak, oﬀering an improved discrimination of MIP particles from noise,
and leading to an increase of the detector eﬃciency.

A. Gain in the ampliﬁcation gap

We have studied the evolution of the Landau distribution as a function of the micro-mesh
voltage and for a constant cathode voltage. We observe that the position of the maximum
increases with the micro-mesh voltage: an increase of 20 V changes the position of the
Landau maximum by a factor 2. The total number of electrons collected at the anode pad
is calculated as:

N pad

e =

fL × (ML − MG)

fg × e

(2)

where ML and MG are the position of the maximum of the Landau and Gaussian distribu-
tions respectively, fg = 10 mV/fC is the gain of the GASSIPLEX (pre-ampliﬁer and shaper)
electronics [20], fL is the factor to convert the average charge from the maximum value
(GEANT simulations of the energy loss ﬂuctuations give fL = 2.5) and e is the charge of
the electron. The gain, G, is calculated as:

G =

e

N pad
N prim

e

(3)

e

where N prim
is the number of primary electrons generated in the conversion gap. The gain
ranges from several hundreds to several thousands for a voltage variation between 380 and
450 V (Fig. 6). The maximum achieved gain in the ampliﬁcation gap, while staying below
the spark threshold, is of the order of 104.

B. Detector eﬃciency

The detector eﬃciency for MIPs was studied as a function of the detector gain (Fig. 7
and Fig. 8). The eﬃciency, ǫ, has been therefore deﬁned as the ratio between the integrated
area of the Landau distribution, L(c) starting from nσG (where nσG corresponds to n times
the noise width), and of the total integrated Landau distribution:

ǫ =

L(c)dc
RnσG
R0 L(c)dc

(4)

where c is the induced charge in a pad. A direct measurement of the detector eﬃciency
deduced from the events registered with the small beam trigger is in good agreement with
the value deduced using the above method. For micromesh voltages larger than 420 V (i.e.
G > 3.0 · 103), the measured detector eﬃciency is larger than 95%. The steep drop of the
detector eﬃciency for voltages below 410 V results from the fact that the gain is too low to
induce a signal larger than the nominal noise dispersion. Subtraction of the correlated noise
considerably improves the eﬃciency, and a 95% eﬃciency is already reached for a gain of
2 · 103.

6

C. Discharges in the ampliﬁcation gap

The fundamental limitation of micro-pattern gas detectors results from the discharges
induced by high particle ﬂuxes or highly ionizing particles. Several mechanisms have been
put forward to explain this breakdown process [17]. In the particular environment expected
in ALICE (mainly dominated by a hadron background at low ﬂux, below 1 Hz/mm2), the
transition to a streamer regime followed by a electrical discharge occurs when the avalanche
starts to contain a critical quantity of a few 107
− 108 electrons (Raether criterion) [18].
Highly ionizing particles like alpha particles loose around 500 keV of their kinetic energy in
the drift gap releasing about N prim
= 3 · 104 primary electrons, whereas MIPs loose only
around 1 keV (generating around 30 primary electrons). Alpha particles will, therefore,
induce a discharge in the MICROMEGAS for gains above several 103 (leading to Npad larger
than 107). The same eﬀect is observed when the MICROMEGAS detector is irradiated with
hadron MIPs, like charged pions. In this case, nuclear interactions with nuclei of the gas
mixture in the drift gap could be at the origin of the induced discharges, since a strong
dependence with the average atomic number of the gas mixture has been observed [16,19].
Although MICROMEGAS detectors are very resistant to sparks, a discharge will induce a
non-negligible dead time over the whole detector active area, leading to a reduction of the
eﬀective eﬃciency.

e

We have measured (Fig. 9) the discharge probability per ionizing particle as a function
of the detector gain. We obtain discharge probabilities roughly between 10−6 and 10−5 for
diﬀerent prototypes. The discharge probability does not depend on the beam intensity, as it
could be expected. However, since the beam intensity was measured by Pl1 and Pl2 coinci-
dences, impinging-particle trajectories outside of the plastic active area and passing through
the MICROMEGAS detector, were not counted. This induces an asymmetric systematic
error which would tend to slightly decrease the measured discharge probability.

Central heavy ion collisions at LHC will induce a ﬂow of charged particles of the order
of 50 charged particles per m2 in PHOS [5]. Taking a conservative value of 8000 central
collisions per second, the charged particle rate will be of the order of 50 KHz per chamber.
If the detector operates at gains of 2000 (leading to eﬃciencies larger than 95%), we expect a
spark probability of 3 · 10−6 (Fig. 9), i.e. a spark rate of 0.15 spark/chamber/second. Taking
into account the fact that the dead time induced by a spark is less than 10 ms [16,19], the
dead-time induced by sparks will be as low as 0.15%. In this respect, the particle induced
discharges are not a handicap of the MICROMEGAS detectors, when the chambers operate
at modest gains.

In addition, recent measurements [16,19], exhibit a strong dependence of the spark prob-
ability per ionizing particle on the average atomic number of the gas mixture, following a
Z −4 dependence. Therefore, selecting a gas mixture with Ne gas should lead to an additional
reduction of the spark probability by more than one order of magnitude.

D. Background induced by the passive converter

The background induced by the lead passive converter in the MICROMEGAS pad cham-
bers has also been studied. Using the narrow beam trigger (see Fig. 10 where almost no

7

noise peak is apparent) we have measured the charge distribution in the neighboring pads
without and with the lead passive converter. We observe the following (Fig. 11):

• without converter, 2% of MIPs induce a signal larger than the nominal noise in a

neighboring pad;

• with converter, only 6% of MIP particles induce a signal in a neighboring pad.

We conclude that the passive converter induced background is relatively small, and the
detector occupancy of the MICROMEGAS pad chambers is hardly increased.

E. Pre-shower response function to electrons and hadrons

In this last section, we present the response function of the pre-shower detector to hadrons
and electrons of 2 GeV/c momentum. The discrimination between the hadron and electron
beam was done by means of the Cherenkov counter C2 (Fig. 4). Comparisons of the
experimental response functions with the results of GEANT3.21 simulations of the pre-
shower detector were also performed [7].

• Hadron beam (Fig. 12): The PC detector exhibits almost the same Landau-like
distribution with and without the converter. Fluctuations of the deposited energy
in the thin conversion gas gap were calculated using the PAI model implemented
in GEANT. This simulation reproduces relatively well the shape of the Landau-like
distribution, although GEANT underestimates the tail of the measured distribution.

• Electron beam (Fig. 13): Without converter, the PC detector exhibits the same
Landau-like distribution observed with the hadron beam. However, by including the
converter (1.07 X0) in the setup, a wider distribution is observed: on average 65%
of the impinging electrons develop an electromagnetic shower inside the converter.
The secondary particles produced in the shower will result, on average, in a higher
energy deposit in the gas cell associated to the anode-pad leading to a broader charge
distribution. GEANT3.21 simulations of the deposited energy by 2 GeV/c electrons
describe rather well the observed distribution.

We conclude that the hadron response function is not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the passive
converter. However, electrons exhibit a very diﬀerent response function in the presence of the
passive converter, due to the initial development of electromagnetic showers. The deposited
energy distribution in PC detector is wider, and this observation could be exploited to
improve the electron and positron identiﬁcation power of the PHOS detector.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

We have developed a large-area MICROMEGAS detector with anode pads read-out. Pro-
totypes have been irradiated with a 2 GeV/c momentum beam of electrons and hadrons. We
have studied the pad response function, the gain in the ampliﬁcation gap and the detector

8

eﬃciency as a function of the electric ﬁeld. The measured performances are in good agree-
ment with those obtained in other MICROMEGAS developments. We have investigated
the discharge probability per incident MIP particle, concluding that the induced discharges
do not represent a real handicap to operate MICROMEGAS chambers in the environment
expected in central heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies. A pre-shower detector design based
on a sandwich of two MICROMEGAS chambers with a passive Pb converter in between,
has been proven to be a promising option for the improvement of PHOS detection capabili-
ties. The measured background induced by the converter in the MICROMEGAS chambers
is very small. The pre-shower response function of hadrons and electrons presents various
facets worth exploiting further. We observe that the hadron beam induces, in both gas
detectors, the typical Landau-like distribution of the collected charge. The electron beam
not only induces the typical Landau-like distribution in the CPV detector of the pre-shower
but also exhibits a much wider charge distribution in the PC detector, signing the initial
development of the electromagnetic shower.

Following the results of the tests discussed in the present article, an improved version of
a PPSD has been designed. The new detector has a larger active area (380×380 mm2), a
thicker conversion gap (6 mm) better suited for the use of a gas mixture like Ne with 5-10%
of CO2 and a 200 µm ampliﬁcation gap [21]. These improvements (larger ampliﬁcation
gap and lighter gas mixture), will lead to allow for a reduction of the spark probability by a
factor 20 to 50, and therefore lead to a spark rate of 10 sparks/chamber/hour for the ALICE
hadronic environment. In addition, the size of the pad has been reduced to 11×11 mm2 in
order to reach the spatial resolution needed to determine the shower vertex.

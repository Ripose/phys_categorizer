Simple acoustical technique for automated
measurement of drift tube anode wire tension

Abstract

We describe a simple and inexpensive acoustical technique that permits rapid, ac-
curate and in-situ measurement of drift tube anode wire tensions even if the anode
wire is electrically discontinuous.

1 Introduction

The accurate determination of wire tensions in drift chambers is a necessary
quality control step in the construction of properly performing chambers. Nu-
merous techniques are described in the literature[1] that rely on a variety of
means to induce oscillations in the wire being measured. Typically, these os-
cillations induce an emf or change the mutual capacitance between the anode
and its neighboring electrodes. These induced eﬀects are then maximized by
explicitly tuning the frequency of the input perturbation. The frequency for
which the response is maximum is then related to the wire tension by a simple
expression for the frequency of possible standing waves on a stretched wire
as a function of the wire’s tension. Such techniques, while useful, have the
drawbacks that the anode wire be electrically continuous and that the input
perturbation be explicitly tuned in frequency to maximize the response.

We have developed an automated wire tension measuring scheme that is suit-
able for drift chambers with electrically discontinuous anode wires and that
requires no time-consuming frequency adjustment of the input perturbation.
Electrically discontinuous anode wires, formed by fusing a dielectric to two
halves of an anode wire, are an expedient occupancy reducing measure for

chambers exposed to a large ﬂux of charged particles. Our technique was de-
veloped to measure the tensions of the electrically discontinuous anodes of the
56, 000 channel forward straw tracker of the BTeV project at FNAL. Other
≃
detectors, such as the transition radiation tracker of the ATLAS experiment
at LHC, also use drift tubes with electrically discontinuous anodes.

2 Principle of the method

The general idea of our technique is to use a short burst of sound with a
uniform spectral density over some ﬁnite frequency range to excite standing
waves on a biased anode wire and to then measure the resulting power spectral
density (PSD) associated with the induced current sourced from the anode-
cathode capacitive system. The PSD, as shown below, peaks at a frequency
that corresponds to the tension of the anode. Exciting the wire with a spec-
trum of frequencies simultaneously rather than serially with a single frequency
allows the tension measurement to be done accurately with great speed.

It is well known that a wire of uniform linear mass density µ under tension T
with ﬁxed end-points a distance L apart supports standing waves of frequency

where n is a positive integer and labels the (n
1)th harmonic. As a biased
anode vibrates with respect to its neighboring cathode(s), the resulting change
in the mutual capacitance between the two produces a current ˙Q(t) = ˙C(t)V0,
where C(t) is the anode-cathode mutual capacitance and V0 is the constant
bias voltage of the anode with respect to the cathode. The current ˙Q(t) can be
processed by a simple transimpedance ampliﬁer to produce an output voltage
V ′(t) which in turn can be fourier analyzed to produce its associated PSD.
The frequency at which the PSD peaks is then converted to the anode tension
T by Eq. 1.

A sound burst with the desired uniform spectral composition is easily gener-
ated using the basic properties of the fourier transform of a function in the
time domain h(t) and its conjugate in the frequency domain H(f ):

3 Procedure and test results

We demonstrate our tension measuring technique using a representative pro-
totype straw tube from the BTeV project. The straw tube is comprised of
a 20 µm diameter gold-plated tungsten anode wire inside a 4 mm diameter
kapton straw with a conductive inner surface. The anode is centered inside
the 100 cm long straw using special helical ﬁxtures that set the radial po-
sition of the anode at both straw ends as well as at the straw mid-point.
The distance between neighboring ﬁxtures, corresponding to node locations
for standing waves, is L = 50 cm. A simple pulley and hanging mass system
allows the anode to be tensioned with diﬀerent mass values. The anode is
biased at V0 = 70 V with respect to the cathode, far less than the typical bias
value used for actual tracking operation. The front face of a 1.5 Watt personal
computer (PC) speaker used to vibrate the anode is positioned 5 cm above the
straw mid-point and the volume level is set at 30

The sound generation and output signal processing are done using a combina-
tion of commercial hardware and software (LabVIEW), an op-amp conﬁgured
as a transimpedance ampliﬁer and the speaker. A standard LabVIEW routine
calculates the sinc function of Eq. 7 using values of a1 and a2 that make H(f )
loosely bracket the frequency of the fundamental mode corresponding to the
anode wire’s anticipated tension. For example, in the case of the anode ten-
sioned to 50 gm, f1
225 Hz so that a1 and a2 can be set to correspond to
≃
f = 200 Hz and f = 250 Hz, respectively.

We generate a speaker voltage proportional to h(t) by ﬁrst software sampling
h(t) (at a rate four times faster than what we eventually sample our ﬁnal out-
put signal with) and then using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) located on
a National Instruments DAQ card 1 to feed the speaker a sequence of voltage
levels. The duration of the voltage waveform is 1 second and its quality can
be measured by using an analog-digital-converter (ADC) located on the same
DAQ card. Fig. 1 shows the speaker voltage and its apparent sinc-like shape.
After digitization, the corresponding one-sided PSD of the speaker voltage is
computed using the fast fourier transform (FFT) technique contained in a
standard LabVIEW routine. The result is shown in Fig. 2, showing clearly its
ﬂat-top nature and the desired bracketing of the anode’s nominal fundamental
frequency.

The equivalent circuit of the biased straw tube and its readout circuitry is
shown in Fig. 3. The FET-input op-amp is a Burr-Brown OPA137P and the
large feedback resistor is required because the straw’s induced current is quite
small. (The estimated fractional change in the straw’s capacitance due to
10−3. See Ref. [2].) The op-amp’s output
anode wire vibration is δC/C
voltage V ′(t) is digitized by the DAQ card’s ADC (we uniformly sample 10,000
times during the 1-second sound burst) and then fourier analyzed using the
FFT algorithm. The computation time for the FFT is negligible. The digitized
V ′(t) is shown in Fig. 4 and its PSD as a function of frequency is shown in
Fig. 5. A clear peak at the nominal fundamental frequency of the anode is
seen. The total time for sound generation and signal processing is 2-3 seconds
per anode.

Many systematic tests were performed to verify the robustness of the tech-
nique. Altering the speaker position along the straw length and changing the
horizontal orientation of the anode to vertical had no appreciable eﬀect on the
peak frequency of the output voltage PSD. The peak frequency was similarly
insensitive to a reduction of the anode-cathode bias voltage by a factor of two.

The dynamic range of the technique was investigated by hanging diﬀerent
masses in the range 20-100 gm from the anode, producing a nominal anode
fundamental frequency in the range 145-320 Hz. For each nominal tension, the
above procedure was repeated and the peak PSD frequency determined. Each
resulting PSD plot was similar in shape to Fig. 5. The cumulative results are
shown in Fig. 6 where the measured peak PSD frequency fp (each data point

square root of the hanging mass √mH . The heavy line is a linear ﬁt of fp to
√mH , with a χ2/degree-of-freedom = 1.1, showing excellent agreement with
the form of Eq. 1.

Abstract

Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source, a γ-ray beam line of 10MeV order was proposed recently. The beam line is
expected to generate γ-ray with maximum energy of 22MeV by backward Compton scattering between CO2 laser and
electron in the 3.5GeV storage ring of future Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The ﬂux of non-collimated
γ-ray can be 109 ∼ 1010 s−1 if a commercial CO2 laser of 100W order output power is employed and injected with
optimized settings.

Key words: Compton backscattering, Gamma ray source,
PACS: 13.60.Fz, 41.75.Ht, 07.85.Fv

1. Introduction

Compton backscattering (CBS) of

laser light
against relativistic electron could be a promising
method to obtain polarized monochromatic γ rays
with small divergence angle. This idea was pointed
out by Milburn (1), Arutyunian and Tumanian (2)
for the ﬁrst time in 1963.

Among γ-ray producing techniques, CBS method
possesses several signiﬁcant advantages (3). First,
Compton scattering is well understood within QED
framework, and there are deﬁnite relations among
energy, emitting angle, cross section, polarization,
etc. of the scattered photons. Second, the scattered
photons has a sharp cut-oﬀ near the maximum en-
ergy and the largest fraction of photons is in the high
energy region. Third, CBS γ-rays based on relativis-
tic e− have a very small divergence angle, that al-

lows experiments with both compact targets and de-
tectors. Fourth, CBS method provides a convenient
and swift way to steer the polarization of γ-rays by
changing polarization of injected laser beams.

The ﬁrst γ-ray facility based on CBS method, the
LADON beam, started to operate in 1978 (4; 5; 6; 7).
Till now, there are several γ-ray facilities all over the
world (8). Most of them produce γ-ray from several
hundred MeV to several GeV. Also, there are a few
MeV γ-ray facilities: HIγS(9; 10) on Duke storage
ring, BL05SS(11; 12) on SPring-8 storage ring and
BL-1(13; 14) on NewSUBARU.

The future Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Fa-
cility (SSRF) (15) provides precious opportunity to
build a γ source of high quality. Recently, Shang-
hai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), a
γ-ray beam line based on CBS method has been
proposed. In the coming sections, basic relations
of CBS method will be described brieﬂy, the pro-
posed SLEGS facility and γ-ray it generated will
be illustrated and compared with other CBS γ-ray

Compton scattering between e− and photon can
be described within QED framework(16). The kine-
matics of CBS in laboratory (LAB) frame a), elec-
tron rest (ER) frame b), and related Feynman dia-
gram c) is shown as Fig.1.

Energy of CBS γ photon Eγ is related to the emit-

ting angle θ:

Eγ =

(1 + β)EL
1 − β cos θ + (1 + cos θ)EL/E0

(1)

incident e−, γ =
where E0 is the energy of
E0/m0c2 = 1/
1 − β2 the relativistic factor,
m0c2 = 0.511 MeV mass of e− at rest and EL the
energy of incident laser photon. In case of relativis-

p

2

tic e−, i.e., γ ≫ 1 and β ≈ 1, formula(1) can be
simpliﬁed as:

Eγ =

4γ2EL
1 + 4γ2EL/E0 + γ2θ2

(2)

which indicates that the maximum energy of CBS
photon is proportional to γ2 approximately.

The angular diﬀerential cross-section of CBS γ-
rays in ER frame follows Klein-Nishina formula(17).
The angular diﬀerential cross-section in LAB frame
can be derived by Lorentz transformation. In case
of relativistic e−, the angular divergence of CBS γ-
rays in LAB frame is in order of 1/γ.

When injected laser beam is totally polarized, the
degree of polarization of CBS γ photons has a clear
relationship with the scattering angle(8).

The ideal ﬂux nγ of CBS γ rays is related to
the impact geometry and spatial densities of elec-
tron and laser beams. The spatial density of elec-
trons is treated as product of Gaussian distribu-
tions, the corresponding widths are determined by
beam qualities and TWISS functions of the stor-
age ring(18; 19; 20). The spatial density of laser is
also treated as product of Gaussian distributions,
the corresponding widths are determined by optics
of Gaussian beams(21).

In a typical head-on setup, the ideal ﬂux of CBS

γ rays is:

nγ = P0IL

where P0 is the laser power, I the current of e−
beam, and L the luminosity:

(3)

(4)

where σ denotes the total Compton cross section, w
the transversal dimension of laser, σx,y the horizon-
tal and vertical width of the e− bunch respectively.
One should notice that the actual luminosity L∗
is signiﬁcantly aﬀected by geometrical restriction of
both injected laser beam and extracted γ beam, this
is limited by vacuum tube dimensions of the stor-
age ring. Henceforth, we applied proper selection on
ideal CBS events during the Mote-Carlo simulation.

then focused and injected into SSRF storage ring
from front-end downstream to the selected sector,
i.e., the interaction region by a thin mirror. The op-
erating laser is aligned to the electron beam by a
co-axis visible laser. Once laser beam overlaps e−
bunches, Compton backscattering occurs between
relativistic electron and laser photon, γ-ray with de-
termined energy and a narrow divergence angle is
generated, transported and then extracted from the
inject front-end. After the rear-end upstream to the
interaction region, remaining laser light is inspected
by a set of monitors which provides feedback and
control signals as well.

3.1. SSRF and its storage ring

SSRF, now under construction, will operate by
year 2009. It will be a high performance third-
generation synchrotron facility producing high
brightness X-ray covering an energy range from
0.1keV to 40keV(15). It consists of an 100MeV
LINAC, an 100MeV to 3.5GeV booster, a 3.5GeV
storage ring and associated experimental stations.
The storage ring has 4 identical long straight sec-
tors, 16 identical standard straight sectors, and
40 bending magnets(22). Its designed features are
listed in Table.1.

The future SLEGS facility can be constructed on
one of the standard straight sectors of SSRF, prob-
ably on sector 20. TWISS functions of sector 20 is
shown as Fig.3.

There are two kinds of vacuum tube assembled
along SSRF storage ring. Vacuum tube for the bend-
ing sectors has a ±7.5 mm vertical water-cooling
slit to encapsulated microwave radiation of the RF,
shown as Fig.4 . Such slits are the most conﬁning
parts for laser beam in transversal directions, hence-

forth cause a considerable limitation on the popula-
tion of injecting photons, and consequentially limit
the total ﬂux of CBS γ-ray most.

3.2. CO2 Laser and Corresponding CBS γ-ray

The fundamental wavelength of CO2 laser is
10.64µm, the corresponding EL is 0.117eV. The
maximum energy of CBS γ-ray of CO2 laser with
3.5GeV electron is about 22MeV. Commercial CO2
laser is widely used in many industrial ﬁelds. It
has several advantages compared to molecular gas
lasers with longer wave lengthes:
– well developed, compact, and with high qualities;
– high output power that promises a high ﬂux of

CBS γ-ray;

– run under both continuous and pulsed mode;
– relatively low cost and low technological risk;
– easy to manage and control.

The angular diﬀerential cross section and energies
of CBS γ-ray from CO2 laser against 3.5GeV elec-
tron is shown as Fig.5. Since maximum energy of
BCS γ-ray (∼22 MeV) is within the momentum ac-
ceptance of SSRF storage ring(±105 MeV), all scat-
tered electrons will be re-accelerated. Hence SLEGS
can operate parasitically, independent of other users
on SSRF in principle.

The transversal restriction of SLEGS vacuum

We have developed a C++ program based on
Monte-Carlo method to simulate the generation

of CBS γ-ray. First, conﬁguration of SLEGS,
laser/electron bunch parameters and TWISS func-
tions are loaded; then, the related ideal luminosity
with inﬁnite acceptance is calculated. Second, the
program starts to sample space coordinates of ideal
CBS events according to the ideal luminosity dis-
tribution. Third, the program samples momentum
coordinates for each incident laser photon, and
checks if it can pass the geometrical restriction or
not. Fourth, the scattered angles of CBS γ-ray are
sampled according to diﬀerential cross section of
Compton scattering. Last, the program checks if
the CBS γ ray is ”actual”, i.e., the γ ray can pass
the geometrical restriction or not.

In a head-on setup, ﬂux of CBS γ rays is related
to the focusing position and waist dimension of laser
beam, shown as Fig.7. Since the designing of SLEGS

front end is now undergoing, we consider the ﬂange
connecting storage ring and front end as the inspect-
ing plane. The laser power on the inspecting plane
is considered to be the injected power, and CBS γ
rays that reach the inspecting plane are considered
to be actual. We tried three diﬀerent focuses for
CO2 laser: at the down-stream end (A), center (B)
and up-stream end (C) of the drift space respecting
to the beam direction of electron bunch, as shown
in Fig.6. In Fig.7, solid and open symbols represent
actual(L∗) and ideal(L) values respectively; squares,
circles and triangles represent luminosity of diﬀer-
ent laser focusing position at A, B and C respec-
tively. As we can see in Fig.7, although lasers with

5

waist dimension of ∼ 1mm correspond to maximum
L, the related values of L∗ are evidently limited by
geometrical restriction.

The most optimized waist dimension for CO2 laser
is around 1.6mm, while the focus is on the down-
stream side. In that case, we can obtain a maximum
L∗ ∼ 7 × 107 A−1W−1s−1. Considering SSRF stor-
age ring running under multi bunch mode(Im = 300
mA), the ﬂux of BCS γ-ray is expected to be ∼ 1010
s−1 if a CW CO2 laser of 500 W is employed.

power gathered within a given collimation angle Θ

output power. The maximum energy of γ-ray is
about 22MeV.

Several CBS γ-ray facilities of 10 MeV order are
listed in Table.2. Compared with those facilities,
SLEGS has several unique properties.

First of all, SLEGS is expected to achieve ﬂux of
non-collimated γ-ray up to 109 ∼ 1010 s−1 using a
commercial CW CO2 laser of 100W order output
power. The high brightness γ-ray will be a powerful
probe to meet requirements of many experimental
researches.

Second, since SSRF storage ring has a proper
energy to generate γ-ray of 10MeV order by CO2
laser, SLEGS does not have to use a complicated far
infrared (FIR) laser system like BL05SS on SPring-
8, so that issues of relatively-low output power,
transmission and focusing for operating laser can
be avoided.

γ

Last, HIγS possesses unique preponderance of
the tunable Emax
by using a tunable free electron
laser (FEL). However, one of the key issues HIγS
has to handle is the synchronization between FEL
pulses and target electron bunches. While SLEGS
will avoid such an issue since the operating laser
will run under a CW mode.

γ

To meet the potential requirements of Emax

lower
than 22MeV, an oblique injection setup for CO2
laser is within our scope. If the impact angle between
laser and electron beam is changeable, one can ob-
tain γ-ray with determined maximum energy. How-
ever, such a setup will deﬁnitely cause a decreased
γ-ray ﬂux, thus method like external laser resonator
(23) is necessary to enforce power of the operating
CO2 laser.

5. Summary

In this paper, SLEGS, a γ-ray beam line based
on backward Compton scattering was suggested.
SLEGS is expected to achieve a ﬂux of non-
collimated γ-ray up to 109 ∼ 1010 s−1 by employing
a CW mode commercial CO2 laser of 100W order

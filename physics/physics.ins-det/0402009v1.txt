The CMS experiment at LHC features the largest Silicon Strip Tracker (SST) ever
build. This device will be immersed in a 4T magnetic ﬁeld in conjunction with a
Pixel system allowing the momentum reconstruction of charged particles and the
heavy-ﬂavor tagging despite the hostile radiation environment. The impact of the
operating conditions and the physics requirements on the SST layout and design
choices is discussed and the expected performances are reviewed.

1. Requirements and Implications

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment will observe pp collision
at 14 TeV of center-of-mass energy with a luminosity of 1034cm−2s−1. The
bunch crossing frequency is 1/25ns = 40 MHz and ∼ 20 minimum bias inter-
actions per bunch crossing are expected, resulting in ∼ 2000 charged tracks
per event and a hadron ﬂux up to 1014cm−2y−1 close to the interaction
region.

The physics requirements, a momentum resolution of ∼ 1 − 2%PT at
∼ 100 GeV/c and an impact parameter resolution of ∼ 10 − 20µm, have to
be obtained by instrumenting a cylindrical volume of 5.4m in length and
2.4m in diameter immersed in a 4T axial magnetic ﬁeld. The innermost
region (r < 15cm) is occupied by a pixel detector, described elsewhere1.
The CMS collaboration decided to instrument the remaining volume by
using only Silicon microstrip modules organized in 10 cylindrical layers and
12 disks as sketched in Figure 1, corresponding to more than 200m2 of active
surface. A detailed description of the Silicon Strip Tracker (SST) and its
expected performances can be found elsewhere2. Only a brief overview is
given here.

double-sided modules, respectively.

2. The Tracker Layout

The tracker is divided into four main subsystem: the innermost four cylin-
drical layers make up the Inner Barrel (TIB); the outermost six cylindrical
layers deﬁne the Outer Barrel (TOB); the 2 × 3 disks with |z| between
∼ 70cm and ∼ 110cm are the Inner Disks (TID), each organized in three
rings; the bigger 2×9 disks in the |z| & 120cm region, organized in four to
seven rings, are the Endcaps (TEC).

Most SST modules are single sided; the “barrel” modules and the “disk”
modules have the readout strips laying along the z direction and the radial
direction, respectively, allowing the readout of the rφ coordinate; however
some threedimensional information is needed to separate tracks. A space
point readout is obtained by using a double-sided module, a back-to-back
sandwich of a rφ module and a special stereo module with the strips tilted by
100 mrad. Double-sided modules equip the two innermost layers of TIB and
TOB, the two innermost rings of TID, and the TEC rings with r . 40cm
and with 60cm . r . 76cm (see Figure 1). This layout allows the SST
to provide 8 to 14 measurements points for high momentum tracks with
|η| < 2.5. On average about half of them are threedimensional points.

3. The modules

The overall dimensions of the SST, the largest device of this kind ever
built, require such a huge number of basic elements to impose an indus-
trial approach to the design and the production. The SST modules and
their components share the same basic structure and design. Each module
consists of a carbon ﬁber frame that supports the silicon detector and the

readout electronics, hosted on a front-end hybrid.

The modules have to comply with the following characteristics: a pitch
of the order of ∼ 100µm to ensure the target momentum resolution; radia-
tion resistance with no signiﬁcant performance degradation for the 10-years
of LHC lifetime; high granularity in time (low pile-up, i.e. ∼ 25ns shaping
time) and in the space domain (occupancy below 1%, i.e. a cell size of
∼ 1cm2, corresponding to a strip length of the order of ∼ 10cm) to ensure
a robust and eﬃcient pattern recognition.

All the SST detectors are standard p+-on-n microstrip sensors with AC
readout and polysilicon bias resistor, produced by single-sided lithographic
process on 6”-wafer industrial lines, thus allowing an eﬀective cost reduc-
tion. The sensor radiation hardness relies upon several features3: special
design details like multi-guard rings, the constant width-over-pitch of 0.25,
and the metal over-hang (metal strips wider than underlying implants) ef-
fectively improve the breakdown voltage behavior; the use of low-resistivity
bulk (∼ 1.5 − 8kΩcm) allows the sensors to be depleted at a manageable
voltage over the entire LHC lifetime also after the type inversion; an inter-
strip capacitance almost ﬂuence independent is obtained by using the h100i
lattice orientation that gives a Si-SiO2 interface of better quality.

Nevertheless, the SST operating and storage temperature must be below
−10◦ to keep under control the radiation-induced increase of the leakage
current and to freeze-out the unwanted reverse annealing.

A key design aspect of the SST to limit the costs and the number of
readout channels relies upon the scaling of track multiplicity and radiation
eﬀects with the radius. Occupancy requirement imposes sensors within
∼ 60cm in radius to have a pitch of ∼ 80 − 120µm and a strip length
of ∼ 10cm. To limit the number of readout channels this requirement is
relaxed at r & 60cm choosing a pitch of ∼ 120 − 200µm and a strip length
of ∼ 20cm, obtained by daisy-chaining two single sensors. Similarly, 320µm
thick sensors with ∼ 1.5 − 3.2kΩcm resistivity are needed for r . 60cm to
have a comfortable depletion voltage after the irradiation but, for r & 60cm,
less expensive 500µm thick sensors with ∼ 4 − 8kΩcm resistivity can be
safely chosen, also to compensate the increase of noise due to the larger
strip length. The various shapes and dimensions of the SST detectors are
shown in Figure 2(a) and the evolution of strip length and pitch is shown
in Figure 2(b).

The front-end hybrid is made of a kapton circuit (that also integrates
the connection tail) laminated onto a ceramic rigidiﬁer. It hosts four or six
APV25s, the SST front-end chips, the additional ASICs (APVMUX, PLL

and DCU) and the pitch adapter that allows the APV25 channels’ pitch to
match the sensors’ one.

The APV25 has been designed in 0.25µm CMOS technology for low-
noise and fast signal readout in high radiation environment.
It has 128
charge-sensitive amplifying channels with ∼ 50ns shaping time multiplexed
into a single readout line. A deconvolution ﬁlter is implemented to reduce
the time resolution to ∼ 25ns. A pipeline buﬀer stores analog samples for
192 bunch crossings, corresponding to ∼ 4.8µs, to match the LVL1 trigger
requirements. Further details on the front-end hybrids and a description of
the downstream readout chain can be found elsewhere4.

The assembly of the ∼ 15000 modules needed to complete the entire
SST is performed by means of semi-automatic gantries featuring pattern
recognition for an accurate and reproducible placement of the components
with tolerances that are comparable with the intrinsic resolution of the
device (∼ 10 − 20µm). Similarly the ∼ 25M bonds required to connect
sensors are made by automatic bonding machines.

Production is actually starting. A tight quality assurance procedure is
strictly enforced at each production/assembly step to check that all com-
ponents match the required speciﬁcations. These tests normally include
cooling cycle to reproduce the actual working condition.

4. Mechanics and Material Budget

The modules support structure is made up of carbon ﬁber and honeycomb
frames. It ensures a mechanical stability within ∼ 20µm and the . 100 −
200µm absolute position accuracy needed by track ﬁnding and alignment
procedures5. The structure also hosts services like readout lines, power
cables and cooling pipes (to take out ∼ 1W/module) and has been designed
to grant easy access and operation on all subelements.

Despite all optimization eﬀorts to keep the SST as light as possible the

into a substantial material budget. Figure 3(a) shows the result of the
detailed GEANT4 simulation in terms of radiation lengths as a function of
pseudorapidity η.

5. Performance

The PT resolution, shown for muons in Figure 3(b), is ∼ 2% or better for
PT < 100 GeV/c and |η| < 1.7; at larger pseudorapidity the performance
degrades because of the reduction of the lever arm. The transverse impact
parameter (IP) resolution, shown in Figure 3(c), is . 20µm in the entire η
range covered by the tracker, for muons of PT = 100 GeV/c. Low momen-
tum PT and IP resolutions are degraded by the multiple scattering. The
track reconstruction eﬃciency is close to 100% for muons in most of the

pseudorapidity range, while it drops to 90% − 95% for pions and tracks
within jets, mostly because of nuclear interactions.

As shown in Figure 4(a) and (b), suﬃcient track reconstruction accuracy
is achieved by using the pixel hits and a reduced number of silicon strip
hits, tipically four to six. Such ﬁgures demonstrate the redundancy and
the robustness of the SST layout and the possibility to use fast tracking
algorithms for trigger applications6.

The negative impact of the large material budget on the SST perfor-
mances can be reduced by designing reconstruction algorithms that take
into account the presence of material. As an example, electrons suﬀer for
large material-dependent bremsstrahlung energy losses. A precise model-
ing of this eﬀect has been implemented in a special electron reconstruction
algorithm7 by using the Gaussian-sum Filter (GSF), a non-linear general-
ization of the standard Kalman Filter (KF). The impressive gain in resolu-
tion of this special electron reconstruction algorithm is shown in Figure 4(c).

6. Conclusion

The present silicon strip technology allows the CMS collaboration to build
a large scale tracker despite the diﬃcult operating environment of a high-
luminosity, high-energy hadron collider. Detailed simulation studies suggest
that the SST performances will lay within the physics requirements. The
layout redundancy makes possible to use fast-tracking algorithms at trigger
level. The eﬀects of the relatively large amount of material inside the track-
ing volume can be taken into account by accurate modeling and dedicated
algorithms.

INTRODUCTION

Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC) started
data taking in 1989, and they were upgraded in 1996,
and the upgraded detector is called BESII [1]. BES
had taken data until the April of 2004, many results
have been obtained using the data samples collected
at J/ψ, ψ(2S), ψ(3770) and the scan data from 2.0 to
5.0 GeV.

After more 15 years data taking, the machine and
detector are no more competitive to produce ﬁrst
grade physics at this energy region, especially after
CESR reduced its energy to the τ -charm energy re-
gion. After several years of preparation, the Chi-
nese Government gave a green light to begin the
BEPCII/BESIII upgrade at the end of 2003.

BEPCII is a two rings machine built in the existing
tunnel, electrons and positrons are circulated in sep-
arate rings and only collider in the interaction point,
multi-bunches and micro-beta are used to increase the
machine luminosity. Super-conducting cavities and
super-conducting quadruples are used. The Linac has
to be upgraded also to increase its energy and cur-
rents, especially to meet the needs to inject the posi-
tions to the ring in a reasonable short time.

The detector has to be totally rebuilt, with a
43 layers small-cell main drift chamber (MDC), a
time of ﬂight (TOF) system, and an electro-magnetic
calorimeter Made of CsI, a super-conducting magnet
with a ﬁeld of 1 tesla, and resistive plate chambers
(RPC) are inserted in the magnet yoke to serve as the
muon counters.

The whole project is scheduled to complete in 2008,
with a goal that the luminosity of the machine should
reach 3 × 1032cm−2s−1 at the end of 2008.

The main parameters of machine parameters are

listed in Table I.

To increase the injection energy and current to the
rings, the Linac has been upgrades, the main systems
are new acceleration tubes, new klystrons and mod-
ulators, new positron source, new electron gun and
increase the beam repetition rate to 50 Hz, modi-
ﬁed vacuum system, and other relevant modiﬁcations.

The Linac has been debugged and tuned, some of the
performances have already reached the designed val-
ues, and now the main eﬀorts are to understand the
operation of the Linac and to make the running condi-
tion to be stable and install the phase control system.
The achieved performances of the Linac are listed in
Table II.

The main parameters of the storage rings are listed
in Table III. BEPCII storage rings have the following
main systems: the super-conducting rf cavities and
their power supplies and control system; the beam
pipes; the magnets and their power supplies; the kick-
ers; the beam instrumentations; the vacuum system;
the control system. The dipole magnets of old ring
are modiﬁed to be put in the outer ring. Up till now,
most of the hardware devices are delivered, and the
pieces not on site yet are scheduled to be delivered
on time. The current plan is to assemble all the ring
hardware pieces except the super-conducting quadru-
ple magnets, for which more time is needed to get
them tested and to measure the ﬁeld with detector
magnet together. The plan is to commission the whole

rings without the quadruples ﬁrst and provide some
beam time for synchrotron use, then the quadruples
are to be moved in the beam line to be tested together
with other systems, after certain performance goals
are met, especially certain amount of current should
be reached so to verify the large currents can be run
with certain luminosity and reasonable backgrounds

to the detector, before the detector moves in to be de-
bugged together with the machine. The machine and
detector are expected to be commissioned together at
the late half of 2007, and start to take some engineer
run end of 2007 or beginning of 2008. The perfor-
mance of BEPCII will be among the 2nd generation
of e+e− colliders, as shown in Figure 1.

III. BESIII DETECTOR

The BESIII detector [2] is a completely new detec-
tor. Figure 2 shows the schematic of BESIII detector.
The beam pipe is made of two layers of Be pipes,
with the thickness of 0.8 mm and 0.5 mm respec-
tively, and a cooler is passed through between the
pipes to take out the heat caused by the beams.
MDC is the most inside detector component, it has
43 sense wires from inside to outside. To make room
for the machine super-conducting magnet, the end-
plates are made from a cone shaped central section
and a slightly inclined outer plate. The endplates are
manufactured with the average hole accuracy better
than 25 µm. Small cell structure is used with a half
width of cell to be 6 mm for inner layers, and 8.1
mm for outer layers. The sense wire is made of 25
µm tungsten, the ﬁeld wire is made of 110 µm gold
plated Al. Totally there are about 28K wires. The gas
chosen is He(60)/C3H8(40) used by CLEOIII. All the
wires have been strung and the tension and the leak-
age current of all wires are measured and satisfy the
requirements. The electrons readout system adopts
CERN HPTDC to measure the drift time, the proto-
type electron system is tested, and the performances
meet the design requirements. A small chamber was
tested in the KEK beam line, and the space resolution
and dE/dx resolution are satisfactory. The expected
chamber performances are, wire resolution to be bet-
ter than 130 µm, and the momentum resolution is
expected to better than 0.5% for 1 GeV tracks, two
contributions from wire position resolution and mul-
tiple scattering are:σpt/pt = 0.32%/p and 0.37%/β
respectively. The outmost sense wire covers a polar
angle of cos(θ) = 0.83, and the maximum acceptance
is cos(θ) = 0.93, roughly reach 20th sense wire layer.
The expected dE/dx resolution is about 6%.

Mounted on the MDC are two layers of TOF coun-
ters, each layer has 88 counters with a thickness of 5
cm and the two layers are staggered by half a counter
to make a full coverage in the polar angle of cos(θ)
= 0.82. There are photo-tubes at both ends of each
counter to read the signals. And there are 48 single-
layer counters in each side of the endcap region, and
the signal is read out only at the inner end. The
counters are mounted on the endcap EM calorimeter.
BC408 and BC404 scintillators by Bicro are chosen for
barrel and endcap respectively. The photo-tubes used
are R2490-50 by Hamamatsu. From the test beam,
90 and 100 ps time resolutions are achieved for barrel
and endcap respectively, as expected in the design.

Outside of TOF system is a CsI crystal EM
calorimeter. The typical crystal has a dimension of
5 × 5cm2 in the front face and 6.5 × 6.5cm2 in the
rear face, the length is 28 cm, corresponding to 15
radiation length. There are 5280 crystals in barrel
and 960 in the endcap, 480 at each side. Two photo
diodes (Hamamatsu S2744-08) with a photosensitive

fpcp06 313

area of 10 mm × 20 mm are mounted on the rear face
of each crystal to read the lights out. The prototype
for readout electronics is tested to have a noise level
of 1000 electrons. The expected energy resolution will
be 2.5% for 1 GeV photons. The crystals are made
by Crismatec(France), Shanghai Institute of Ceramic
and Beijing Hamamatsu. Most of the crystals are de-
livered and they met the speciﬁcations of dimensions,
light yield and the radiation hardness. The mechani-
cal structure of the calorimeter is designed such that
there are no walls between crystals to reduce the dead
material, the crystals are ﬁxed to a support structure
by 4 screws. N2 will be ﬂew in the crystal container to
maintain the humidity inside, and the front-end elec-
tronics will be cooled by water. The EM calorimeter
is scheduled to be assembled around the end of 2006.
Outside of EM calorimeter is the super-conducting
magnet,
its designed ﬁeld is 1.0 tesla. The mag-
net uses the inner winding technique with the coil
wound inside a Al support cylinder which in turn
cooled by liquid He circled in the pipe welded on the
outer surface of the support cylinder, the Al stabi-
lized NbTi/Cu coil is made by Hitachi company, with
the nominal operating current of about 3700 A, which
has a stored energy of about 10 MJ. The ﬁeld in the
MDC volume has an uniformity of better than 5%,
the ﬁeld will be measured with an accuracy of better
than 0.25%. The magnet is in the stage of testing the
value box and after that to install the valve box with
the magnet coil assembling, then the cryogenic sys-
tem will be connected to the magnet and the whole
magnet will be cooled and tested.

The return yoke is also served as the absorber of
the muon detectors. The active muon detector is
the Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC), there are 9 lay-
ers muon chambers in the barrel and 8 layers in the
endcap, with two orthogonal strip readout alterna-
tively layer by layer. The muon chambers are in-
serted in the steel slots in the yoke. The special fea-
ture of the RPC made in China is that there is no
linseed oil used in the gap of RPC. The gas used is
Ar : C2H2F4 : Iso − Butane = 50 : 42 : 8. All
the RPC are installed in the yoke and the eﬃciencies
and the dark currents measured are quite good, to the
same level as those RPC with linseed oil used in other
experiments.

The whole detector weights about 800 tons. And
the detector hall will be air-conditioned, to control
the temperature at 22 ± 2oC, and the humidity below
55%.

The electronics and trigger use pipelined arrange-
ment, with a trigger latency of 6.4 µs. The trigger
will use TOF, MDC and Muon information to make
decisions. The simulation shows that good (almost
100%) eﬃciency and a good background rejection can
be achieved. The maximum trigger rate will be at J/ψ
energy with a total trigger rate of about 4000 Hz. At
this energy, the good event rate will be about 2000 Hz.

FIG. 2: Schematic of BESIII detector.

The DAQ bandwidth will be about 50 Mbytes per sec-
ond. The readout system is based on VME. The oﬄine
analyzes package is under development, the prelimi-
nary version for event simulation and reconstruction
is ready, the calibration codes and physics analyzes
code are being worked on. The oﬄine system will go
through another two releases to get the package tested
before the real data are taken.

The main designed detector performances are listed
in Table IV, a comparison with CLEOc is made.
Hopefully, some of the parameters may be better than
designed.

IV. PROSPECTIVE PHYSICS

The rich physics topics at this energy region will re-
quire BESIII to take the data at J/ψ, ψ(2S), ψ(3770),
and some energy point for DS, also data at τ threshold
and some scan data to measure hadronic cross-section
in this energy region will be collected. The yearly
yield of events are listed in Table V for diﬀerent en-
ergy points the data are to be taken.

The new X(1835) and other near threshold enhance-
ments recently observed at BES will be studied with
100 times more data, X(3872) and states observed at
3940 MeV and 4260 MeV in other experiments may
be studied in details. There are more scalars existed
in this energy region to be accommodated in naive
quark model, these states will be thoroughly studied.
The ηC , χCJ and hC can be studies with large
statistics. The ρπ puzzle will be studied with more
decay channels and with better accuracy and diﬀer-
ent models can be tested and developed to explain
the mechanism behind that.

A data sample at ψ(3770) are to be taken, it will
enable the measurements related with D decays to
reach a new precision, for example, the Vcd, Vcs can
be measured to a statistic accuracy of about 1.6%,
with a data sample of total accumulated luminosity
. And the D0 ¯D0 mixing and CP violation
of 20 f
will be searched and studied. With huge data sam-
ples, the systematic errors should be well understood,

and a lot of analyzes will adopt partial wave analyzes
(PWA) to fully understand the decay dynamics. Ef-
forts are being made and will be strengthened.

Right now, BES Collaboration has about 18 Chi-
nese institutes and universities, and physicists from
United State, Japan, Germany, Sweden and Russia
have joined. BES welcomes new collaborators to join
this exciting research project, which should last for at

least 10 years. A conference called Charm2006 will be
held in Beijing in June this year to discuss the physics
potentials at BESIII and a US-CHINA workshop on
the BESIII collaboration will be held right afterwards.
All interested persons are welcome.

Abstract

Long lead–scintillator sandwich modules developed for the BNL experiment KOPIO are de-

scribed. The individual 4 m long module consists of 15 layers of 7 mm thick extruded scintillator

and 15 layers of 1 mm lead absorber. Readout is implemented via WLS ﬁbers glued into grooves

in a scintillator with 7 mm spacing and viewed from both ends by the phototubes. Time resolu-

tion of 300 ps for cosmic MIPs was obtained. Light output stability monitored for 2 years shows

no degradation beyond the measurement errors. A 4 m long C–bent sandwich module was also

manufactured and tested.

→ π0ν ¯ν represents a

→ π0ν ¯ν if two of four photons are undetected. To suppress the dominant

background from kaon decays a single photon veto capability must be up to an order of

magnitude better than measured in previous experiments for low energy photons (below

50 MeV). High photon absorption eﬃciency is required to achieve a detection eﬃciency of

better than 0.9998 for 100 MeV photons. High light yield over the entire detector volume is

crucial to deal with photonuclear reactions that are likely to limit the achievable eﬃciency.
Since the momentum of the K 0

L in KOPIO is determined using a pulsed beam and time-of-

ﬂight method, the veto system must have good time resolution of about 200 ps for photon

energies of 100–200 MeV while covering the full solid angle around the kaon decay region.

The cost of the veto system is also a very important issue given the detector size of roughly
3 × 3 × 4 m3. The scheme of the proposed experiment is shown in Fig. 1.

Lead–plastic scintillator sandwich veto counters are being considered for the barrel veto

detector which must have a thickness of 17 X0 (radiation lengths). To read out light from

the long scintillators, a two–ended wavelength–shifting ﬁber readout technique will be used.

The two-ended readout provides good timing as well as redundancy for failed channels.

Similar detectors were used in the BNL experiment E787 [2] (without WLS ﬁbers) and the

2

KEK experiment E391 [3]. The extrusion method allows us to produce relatively cheap long

grooved scintillators which are well matched to the WLS ﬁber readout.

II. SANDWICH MODULE DESIGN

The results of tests of single extruded counters were reported in Ref. [4, 5]. The main

results for extruded counters with WLS ﬁber readout are summarized in Table I.

Although the light attenuation length of extruded polystyrene scintillator is about 30 cm,

the one with WLS ﬁber readout produces 0.8 of the light yield of BC404 scintillator. Single–

clad (s.c.) and multi–clad (m.c.) Bicron ﬁbers provide practically the same time resolution.

Instead of using a wrapping material for a reﬂector we applied a novel technique:

the

scintillator is etched by a chemical agent that results in the formation of a micropore deposit

over the plastic surface, following which the diﬀuse ﬁlm is ﬁxed in a settling tank. The

deposit thickness (30-100 µm) depends on the etching time. An advantage of this approach

over the commonly used white diﬀuse papers is the almost ideal contact of the reﬂector

with the scintillator. Moreover, it provides the option of gluing a lead sheet to the plastic

covered by the chemical reﬂector which facilitates assembling a sandwich unit. We tested

3

a small size sandwich assembly of 5 lead-plastic layers glued together with a high viscosity

polyurethane glue. After gluing we found a light output reduction of about 6%, but then

no subsequent degradation in the light yield was observed for two months. To test the

mechanical properties, a 4 m long dumb module (no ﬁbers) was assembled. Ten layers of

7 mm thick scintillator and 1 mm thick lead were glued together. An additional layer of

0.1 mm stainless steel foil was also glued to the ﬁrst plastic layer. The module sag under its

own weight was measured to be 4 cm after two weeks of testing. This value is close to the

expected sag if the module were a solid polystyrene.

Two straight modules have been manufactured at the Uniplast factory (Vladimir, Rus-

sia). Extruded scintillator slabs 7 mm thick and 1 mm lead plates were ﬁxed together in a

monolithic block by an elastic polyurethane glue. The glue does not soak into the micropore

chemical reﬂector. The number of lead–plastic layers in a single module is 15. The module

width is 150 mm. Single-clad Bicron BCF-92 ﬁbers are glued into 1.5 mm deep grooves

which run along the slab with 7 mm spacing with Bicron BC-600 optical glue. The sand-

wich module is 4 m long. The WLS ﬁbers which extend beyond the body of the module

are 4.5 m long. FEU-115M phototubes with a green-extended photocathode view a bundle

of 315 WLS ﬁbers at each end through silicone cookies, providing a two-end readout. The

modules are wrapped in black light isolation paper.

III. LIGHT OUTPUT

Two trigger counters selected the cosmic MIPs going through the sandwich modules

placed one above another. The upper trigger counter was 15 mm wide and 80 mm long to

localize the hit position. The 4 PMT signals from the modules are sent to analogue fan-

outs where they are distributed to charge-sensitive ADCs and leading edge discriminators.

Before measurements of the module response, single photoelectron peak of each phototube

was calibrated and these values are used to calculate the light yields. Previous experience
with FEU-115M PMTs shows that the single photoelectron peak can drift by ∼ ±5%. The

accuracy of the light yield measurements is determined mainly by this systematic error. The

light yield (l.y.) was scanned along the modules with a step of 30 cm. Results are shown

in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst module yielded about 195 p.e./MIP at the center, corresponding to

9 p.e./MeV, and over 300 p.e./MIP near the ends. The second module yielded 160 p.e./MIP

that resulted in a lower attenuation length for the second module. The l.y. attenuation

curves were ﬁtted with a sum of two exponents. At distances greater than 1 m the attenu-

ation length of fast Bicron ﬁbers was found to be 333 cm in the ﬁrst module, and 280 cm

in the second module. The light output stability of the ﬁrst module is shown in Fig. 3.

The reference point is the module center. During the ﬁrst 5 months of testing the trigger

counters were moved along the module. After that the test bench was ﬁxed to periodically

both ends rested upon the supports, and the sag was measured as deviation of the module

center from the straight horizontal level. Results are shown in Fig. 4. The initial deviation

was 2 cm. After 2 weeks the ﬂexure under its own weight led to fast uncontrolled bowing.

However the sag eﬀect on the light yield is rather weak.

IV. TIMING

A time-amplitude correction was applied to all signals from the sandwich modules.

To suppress the timing spread caused by the trigger counters we used the combination
(T DClef t − T DCright)/2. The timing spectra obtained in this way at the module centers

are shown in Fig. 5. The time resolution is 300 ps for the ﬁrst module, and slightly worse

for the second module. Cosmic MIPs deposit 21 MeV in the scintillator of a single module.
The combination (T DC1lef t + T DC2lef t − T DC1right − T DC2right)/4 produces a resolution

of 235 ps. The resolution dependence on the light output is demonstrated in Fig. 6. Only

the time resolution for photons can be brought to σt[ps] = 72ps/qEγ[GeV ] + 2.7 Fig. 7
shows the time resolution for the ﬁrst module over two years. The resolution over the mod-
ule length is shown in Fig. 8. Applying the straight (T DClef t − T DCright)/2 combination

the best timing is obtained at the module center. Near the ends the resolution have to be

calculated with a more complicated algorithm.

V. C-BENT SANDWICH MODULE

Full photon veto coverage was the motivation to design the C-bent sandwich modules

which can be used to build side walls in the photon veto barrel. The barrel roof and ﬂoor

are made of straight sandwich modules. Phototube readout for the barrel side walls would

create a dead space degrading the photon detection eﬃciency. C-bent modules were proposed

to resolve the problem as shown in Fig. 9. There will be no longer be any projective gaps

for photons emerging from the ﬂat kaon beam. The C-modules are installed vertically, since

for the horizontal alternative the bent part of the modules produces directions with low

radiation thickness.

FIG. 7: Time resolution (rms), measured at the center of the ﬁrst module over years. The points

ﬂuctuate around 300 ps within the time ﬁtting error.

To check the method a few scintillator slabs of 1 m length with WLS readout were

produced. Their light output was measured and then the slabs were bent using the diﬀerent

thermal treatment. The light output was measured again with the same phototube. The

best result shows no light yield drop, the average loss in l.y. for other bent slabs was about

5%.

The prototype module was bent by the following procedure:

1. First, 7 mm thick slabs were produced with length from 3.3 to 4 m applying the

standard methods. Two-mm deep grooves run along the slab with spacing of 7 mm.

Y11 Kuraray WLS ﬁbers of 1 mm diameter were glued into the straight grooved slabs

of extruded polystyrene scintillator covered by chemical reﬂector.

2. The bent slabs were prepared by locally heating the bending place with a warm iron

cylinder. The cylinder temperature was stabilized using water ﬂow through the cylin-

der. The thermostat controls this temperature.

3. Bending over the cylinder with 10 cm radius is done such that the ﬁbers run along the

inner curvature of the slab. Optimum conditions were selected to heat up and cool

VI. CONCLUSION

Long prototype photon veto detectors for the BNL experiment KOPIO were manufac-

tured and tested with cosmic rays. The sandwich modules consist of 15 layers of 7 mm

thick extruded scintillator and 15 layers of 1 mm lead absorber. One of the modules was

bent to have a C-shape. Readout is implemented with WLS ﬁbers. The average yield was

measured with cosmic rays to be about 9 p.e./MeV in the center for straight modules with

fast single-clad Bicron ﬁbers. The light yield for the C–bent module is 2.5 times larger due

to multi-clad Y11 Kuraray ﬁbers. The time resolution for all modules is about 300 ps. The

light output of one of the straight modules was monitored over 2 years and shows no degra-

dation beyond the measurement errors. The light output of the thermally bent C-module is

also stable after 8 months.

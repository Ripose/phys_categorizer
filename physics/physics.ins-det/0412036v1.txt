Abstract

A new method for the extraction of the electric ﬁeld in the bulk of heavily irradiated silicon pixel sensors is presented. It is
based on the measurement of the Lorentz deﬂection and mobility of electrons as a function of depth. The measurements were
made at the CERN H2 beam line, with the beam at a shallow angle with respect to the pixel sensor surface. The extracted
electric ﬁeld is used to simulate the charge collection and the Lorentz deﬂection in the pixel sensor. The simulated charge
collection and the Lorentz deﬂection is in good agreement with the measurements both for non-irradiated and irradiated up
to 1015 neq/cm2sensors.

1 Introduction

The properties of the silicon sensors designed for the
CMS pixel detector [1] will change during the LHC op-
eration. The innermost barrel layer of the CMS pixel
detector is expected to be exposed to a ﬂuence 2 of
3×1014 neq/cm2 per year at full luminosity. The irradia-
tion dose will be few times larger in the case of the LHC
luminosity upgrade. The silicon sensors behavior will be
determined by the radiation damage, which changes the
electric ﬁeld in the silicon bulk and introduces charge
trapping. This will lead to a reduction of the collected

charge [2]. The pixel detector will operate in a 4T mag-
netic ﬁeld and charge carriers will be deﬂected by the
Lorentz force, which enhances charge sharing between
pixels and improves the spatial resolution. However, the
bias voltage will be increased because of irradiation and
the Lorentz deﬂection will be reduced [3]. The spatial
resolution depends on the charge collection, signal, noise
and the Lorentz angle, and is degraded by irradiation.
Here we present measurements of charge collection and
Lorentz deﬂection as a function of depth in the silicon
bulk for heavily irradiated pixel sensors. A new method
for the extraction of the electric ﬁeld in the silicon bulk
is proposed and validated with a simple simulation.

2 Sensors and the measurement technique

The sensors under study were designed for the CMS
pixel detector and based on the “n-on-n” concept [4].
The bulk material is diﬀusively-oxygenated ﬂoat zone
(DOFZ) n-type silicon of h111i orientation and a resistiv-
ity 2-5 kΩ cm. The pixels are formed by p-spray isolated
n+-implants, while the p-n junction is formed by a large
p+-implant on the back side. The thickness of the sensor
is 285 µm and the pixel size is 125 × 125µm2. The sen-
sors were irradiated at the CERN SPS with 24 GeV pro-
tons at room temperature without applying bias voltage
and then stored at -20◦C. The test were carried out at
CERN H2 beam line with 150-225 GeV pions. The beam
entered the pixel plane at a shallow angle α =15◦and
the 3 T magnetic ﬁeld was parallel to the beam (see
Fig. 1). The position of beam exit point “O” was recon-

move to the opposite direction and, together with the
electrons, induce the net current on the pixels situated
along OA. In presence of a magnetic ﬁeld charge carriers
are deﬂected by the Lorentz force and the resulting cur-
rent is induced on the pixels along the segment OD. This
measurement technique was developed in [7] and used to
measure the averaged Lorentz angle, ΘL, by ﬁtting the
deﬂection OD with a straight line. As we will see in sec-
tion 3, the segment OD is curved, because the Lorentz
angle depends on the electric ﬁeld, which changes over
the depth. Here we apply the same technique for mea-
suring the Lorentz angle as a function of depth in the
sensor bulk. The bottom part of Fig. 1 shows the deﬁ-
nition of β(x) for an inﬁnitely small section of the seg-
ment OD. Knowing the beam incident angle α=15◦ and
the deﬂection angle β(x) the Lorentz angle at a certain
depth ΘL(depth) is given by

tan ΘL(depth) =

= tan β(x)/ tan α.

tan β(x(depth))
tan α

Therefore, the Lorentz angle is calculated in each point
in depth with the tangent to the segment OD. The ge-
ometrical position of the segment OD in the xy coordi-
nates plane can be determined from signal asymmetry
of two neighbors pixels. The asymmetry at the (x, y) po-

structed in the pixel coordinates system using the beam
telescope [5]. The beam telescope consisted of four mod-
ules, each containing two silicon strip sensors measuring
the x and y coordinates. The strips had a pitch of 25
µm, readout pitch of 50 µm and the spatial resolution
of each plane was about 1µm. The pixel sensors were
bump-bonded to the PSI30/AC30 chip [6], which read
out all signals from the 22 × 32 pixel matrix. The pixel
sensor was cooled by Peltier elements down to -10◦C.
Both pixel and beam telescope signals were digitized us-
ing VME-based ADC modules controlled by a DAQ soft-
ware written in LabView and LabWindows/CVI (Na-
tional Instruments). The trigger was provided by a PIN
diode of size 3 × 6 mm2 placed between the beam tele-
scope planes before the pixel detector.
In absence of magnetic ﬁeld electrons and holes produced
by particles crossing the pixel sensor drift toward the
electrodes. The electrons move to the n+ side and are
collected along the segment OA (see Fig. 1). The holes

sition is deﬁned as

A(x, y) = (Qx,y+p − Qx,y)/(Qx,y+p + Qx,y),

where Qx,y and Qx,y+p is the charge collected in pixel,
whose center located at (x, y) and (x, y+p), respectively,
and p = 125µm is the pixel size. The asymmetry aver-
aged over all events in each (xy) bin is shown in Fig. 2.
The asymmetry plot was divided into slices along the x
axis. The i-th slice located at xi (e.g. represented by the
solid line in Fig. 2) was ﬁtted with the function

where the parameter yi corresponds to the zero asym-

set of points (yi,xi) determines the segment OD. For
measurement of angle β the parallel misalignment of the
segment OD is not important. The slight rotation (the
line OA can be rotated with respect to the pixel row)
of the sensor in the xy plane was subtracted using the
data without magnetic ﬁeld. Each point xi corresponds
to a certain depth via the relation depthi = xi tan α and
the deﬂection yi can be expressed as a function of depth.
The measured points were ﬁtted with a 5-th order poly-
nomial function (see Fig. 4).

Measurements without magnetic ﬁeld were performed
to determine the signal distribution along the segment
OA see Fig. 1. Assuming the averaged energy loss along
the particle track to be uniform, the average signal in
a pixel along OA is proportional to the charge collec-
tion eﬃciency originating at a certain depth in the sili-
con bulk. The average charge collected by a single pixel
as a function of the pixel position along OA is shown in
Fig. 3 for a sensor irradiated at 6.7×1014 neq/cm2. One
can see, that even at low bias voltage (100-200V) some
charge is collected from the p+ side and the charge has
a minimum in the middle of the sensor thickness. Most
of the charge, however, comes from the region close to
the pixel implant. This behavior can be explained by a

riers. If the sensor is operated in a magnetic ﬁeld, the
collected charge is deﬂected. The signal is induced on
the pixels along the segment OD (see Fig. 1). Since the
electric ﬁeld in irradiated sensor is not linear, the seg-
ment between the points “O” and “D” is curved, and
in each point its tangent determines the deﬂection an-
gle β. This deﬂection as a function of the depth in the
silicon bulk is shown in Fig.4 for diﬀerent ﬂuences and
bias voltages. It must be noticed, that at the edges of
the silicon bulk (depth < 17µm or depth > 268µm) the
measured deﬂection has high systematic uncertainties

the deﬂection shown in Fig. 4) and assuming that most
signal is due to the electrons contribution, the electron
mobility as a function of the depth is given by

is close to the classical linear ﬁeld of an abrupt p-n
junction. For the heavily irradiated sensors the electric
ﬁeld has a double peak with a distinct minimum close
to the middle of the bulk. The origin of the double-peak
electric ﬁeld is qualitatively described in [9]. A two-trap
model producing a doubly-peaked electric ﬁeld was im-
plemented in a detailed detector simulation and the
simulated charge collection was found to be in good
agreement with the measurements [10,11]. By integrat-
ing the electric ﬁeld over depth one can determine the
potential drop across the silicon bulk. The potential
drop agrees with the applied bias voltage within 15%
for all sensors.

distributed. Neither energy loss ﬂuctuation nor charge
diﬀusion was taken into account. In this simulation the
electric ﬁeld lines are assumed to be perpendicular to
the silicon sensor planes and the electric ﬁeld value as
function of the depth was taken from the measurement
shown in Fig. 6. The induced current on time depen-
dency is calculated using Shockley-Ramo theorem [12]

i(t) = Qh(t) ~E(depth(t)) · ~vh(depth(t))+

Qe(t) ~E(depth(t)) · ~ve(depth(t)),

where Qh and Qe are the holes and electrons charge val-
ues deposited by the particle energy loss, respectively, ~E
is the weighting ﬁeld, ~vh and ~ve the holes and electrons
drift velocities, respectively. The drift velocity is calcu-
lated using the measured electric ﬁeld and the electrons
and holes are trapped during the drifting time according
to the exponential law

Qh(t) = Q0he−t/τh, Qe(t) = Q0ee−t/τe,

where the trapping constants τh and τe are taken from
[13]. The induced signal was calculated separately for
holes (see Fig. 7) and electrons (see Fig. 8) taking into
account the Lorentz force. The total induced signal is
shown in Fig. 9. The contribution from holes is signiﬁ-

due to charge diﬀusion, energy deposit ﬂuctuation, elec-

A new method to measure the electric ﬁeld in irradiated
silicon pixel sensors is proposed and validated with a
simulation. The method is based on a precise measure-
ment of the Lorentz deﬂection as a function of depth
in the silicon sensor bulk. The measured electric ﬁeld is
used in a sensor simulation which reproduces very well
both the charge collection and the Lorentz deﬂection.

Abstract

Charge collection measurements performed on heavily irradiated p-spray dofz pixel
sensors with a grazing angle hadron beam provide a sensitive determination of
the electric ﬁeld within the detectors. The data are compared with a complete
charge transport simulation of the sensor which includes signal trapping and charge
induction eﬀects. A linearly varying electric ﬁeld based upon the standard picture
of a constant type-inverted eﬀective doping density is inconsistent with the data.
A two-trap double junction model implemented in ISE TCAD software can be
tuned to produce a doubly-peaked electric ﬁeld which describes the data reasonably
well at two diﬀerent ﬂuences. The modeled ﬁeld diﬀers somewhat from previous
determinations based upon the transient current technique. The model can also
account for the level of signal trapping observed in the data.

1 Introduction

In recent years, detectors consisting of one and two dimensional arrays of
silicon diodes have come into widespread use as tracking detectors in particle
and nuclear physics experiments. It is well understood that the intra-diode
electric ﬁelds in these detectors vary linearly in depth reaching a maximum
value at the p-n junction. The linear behavior is a consequence of a constant
space charge density, Neﬀ, caused by thermodynamically ionized impurities

in the bulk material. It is well known that the detector characteristics are
aﬀected by radiation exposure, but it is generally assumed that the same
picture is valid after irradiation. In fact, it is common to characterize the
eﬀects of irradiation in terms of a varying eﬀective charge density. The use
of Neﬀ to characterize radiation damage has persisted despite a growing body
of evidence [1]-[6] that the electric ﬁeld does not vary linearly as a function
of depth after heavy irradiation but instead exhibits maxima at both n+ and
p+ implants. The work presented in this paper demonstrates conclusively
that the standard picture does not provide a good description of irradiated
silicon pixel detectors. We show that it is possible to adequately describe
the charge collection characteristics of a heavily irradiated silicon detector
in terms of a tuned double junction model which produces a doubly-peaked
electric ﬁeld across the detector. The allowed parameter space of the model
can also accommodate the expected level of leakage current and the level of
signal trapping actually observed in the detector.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the experimental tech-
nique and data, Section 3 describes the carrier transport simulation used to
interpret the data, Section 4 describes the technique used to model doubly-
peaked electric ﬁelds and the limitations of previous models, Section 5 de-
scribes the tuning of a successful model and describes its consequences, and
Section 6 summarizes the results and develops several conclusions.

2 Experimental Technique and Data

This investigation is based upon beam test data that were accumulated as
part of a program to develop a silicon pixel tracking detector [7] for the CMS
experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The measurements were
performed in the H2 line of the CERN SPS in June and September 2003 using
150-225 GeV pions. The beam test apparatus is described in Ref. [9] and is
shown in Fig. 1. A silicon beam telescope [8] consisted of four modules each
containing two 300 µm thick single-sided silicon detectors with a strip pitch
of 25 µm and readout pitch of 50 µm. The two detectors in each module
were oriented to measure horizontal and vertical impact coordinates. A pixel
hybrid detector was mounted between the second and third telescope modules
on a cooled rotating stage. A trigger signal was generated by a silicon PIN
diode. The analog signals from all detectors were digitized in a VME-based
readout system by two CAEN (V550) and one custom built FADCs. The
entire assembly was located in an open-geometry 3T Helmholtz magnet that
produced a magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the beam. The temperature of the test
sensors was controlled with a Peltier cooler that was capable of operating down
to -30◦C. The telescope information was used to reconstruct the trajectories
of individual beam particles and to achieve a precise determination of the

2

particle hit position in the pixel detector. The resulting intrinsic resolution of
the beam telescope was about 1 µm.

of silicon strip detectors and a rotating stage for the pixel detector.

2.1 Pixel Hybrids

The prototype pixel sensors are so-called “n-in-n” devices: they are designed
to collect charge from n+ structures implanted into n- bulk silicon. This de-
sign is thought to provide greater longevity in high radiation ﬁelds and to
allow “partially-depleted” operation after “type-inversion” of the substrate. It
is more expensive than the ”p-in-n” process commonly used in strip detectors
because it requires double-sided processing and the implementation of inter-
pixel isolation. Two isolation techniques were tested: p-spray, where a uniform
medium dose of p-impurities covers the whole structured surface, and p-stop,
where higher dose rings individually surround the n+ implants. Results on
the Lorentz angle and charge collection eﬃciency measurements as well as
a detailed description of both designs can be found elsewhere [9,10]. In this
paper we discuss only measurements performed on p-spray sensors. All test

2.2 Data

The main focus of the work presented in this paper involves a set of charge
collection measurements that were performed using the “grazing angle tech-
nique” [12]. As is shown in Fig. 2, the surface of the test sensor is oriented by
a small angle (15◦) with respect to the hadron beam. A large sample of data
is collected with zero magnetic ﬁeld. The charge measured by each pixel along
the y direction samples a diﬀerent depth z in the sensor. Precise entry point
information from the beam telescope is used to produced ﬁnely binned charge
collection proﬁles. For unirradiated sensors, the cluster length determines the
depth over which charge is collected in the sensor.

Fig. 3. The unirradiated sensor was operated at a bias voltage of 150V which
is well above its depletion voltage (approximately 70V). It produces a large
and uniform collected charge distribution indicating that it is fully depleted (a
large y coordinate indicates a large collection distance). The irradiated sensor
was operated at bias voltages varying from 150V to 600V. It appears to be
partly depleted at 150V, however, signal is collected across the entire thickness
of the detector. Another puzzle is that the ratio of charges collected at 300V
bias and 150V bias is Q(300V)/Q(150V) = 2.1 which is much larger than the
maximum value of √2 expected for a partly depleted junction. It is clear that
the proﬁles for the irradiated sensor exhibit rather diﬀerent behavior than one
would expect for a heavily-doped, unirradiated sensor.

3 Simulation and comparison with data

It is well-known that signal trapping is a signiﬁcant eﬀect in heavily irradiated
silicon detectors. In order to evaluate the eﬀects of trapping, it is necessary to
implement a detailed simulation of the sensor. Our simulation, Pixelav [13],
incorporates the following elements: an accurate model of charge deposition
by primary hadronic tracks (in particular to model delta rays); a realistic elec-
tric ﬁeld map resulting from the simultaneous solution of Poisson’s Equation,
carrier continuity equations, and various charge transport models; an estab-
lished model of charge drift physics including mobilities, Hall Eﬀect, and 3-d
diﬀusion; a simulation of charge trapping and the signal induced from trapped
charge; and a simulation of electronic noise, response, and threshold eﬀects.
A ﬁnal step reformats the simulated data into test beam format so that it can
processed by the test beam analysis chain.

Several of the Pixelav details described in Ref. [13] have changed since they
were published. The commercial semiconductor simulation code now used to
generate a full three dimensional electric ﬁeld map is the ISE TCAD package
[14]. The charge transport simulation was modiﬁed to integrate only the fully-
saturated drift velocity,

the electric ﬁeld, ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld, and rH is the Hall factor of the
carrier. The use of the fully saturated drift velocity permits much larger inte-
gration steps (which had previously been limited by stability considerations)
and signiﬁcantly increases the speed of the code.

The simulation was checked by comparing simulated data with measured data
from an unirradiated sensor. A plot of the charge measured in a single pixel
as a function of the horizontal and vertical track impact position for normally
incident tracks is shown in Fig. 4. The simulation is shown as the solid his-
togram and the test beam data are shown as solid points. Note that the sensor
simulation does not include the “bias dot” structure on the n+ implants which
is used to provide a high resistance connection to ground and to provide a test
pulse capability. There is reduced charge collection from this portion of the
implant and the data shows reduced signal in both projections at the bias dot.
Another check, shown in Table 1, is the comparison of the average Lorentz an-
gle measured at several bias voltages [9]. In both cases, reasonable agreement
is observed between measured and simulated data.

The charge collection proﬁles for a sensor irradiated to a ﬂuence of Φ =
1014 neq/cm2 and operated at bias voltages of 150V and 300V are
8.1
presented in Fig 5. The measured proﬁles are shown as solid dots and the
simulated proﬁles are shown as histograms. The simulated proﬁles were gen-
erated with electric ﬁeld maps that correspond to two diﬀerent eﬀective den-
sities of acceptor impurities. The red histograms are the simulated proﬁle for
1012 cm−3. Note that the 300V simulation agrees well with the
Neﬀ = 3.5
measured proﬁle but the150V simulation is far too broad. The blue histograms

show the result of increasing Neﬀ to 24
density, the width of the simulated peak in the 150V distribution is close to
correct but it does not reproduce the “tail” seen in the data at large y. The
300V simulated distribution is far too narrow and the measured signals are
too small (note that the proﬁles are absolutely normalized). It is clear that a
simulation based upon the standard picture of a constant density of ionized
acceptor impurities cannot reproduce the measured proﬁles.

Note that the simulation of the irradiated sensor includes the eﬀects of trap-
ping. The trapping rates of electron and holes have been shown to scale linearly
with ﬂuence [15,16]. Unfortunately, the ﬂuence measurements have a fractional
uncertainty of
10% which feeds directly into an uncertainty on the trapping
rates. An additional uncertainty arises because annealing can modify the trap-
ping rates by 30% [15] leading to a fairly large overall uncertainty. The charge
collection proﬁles are not very sensitive to the hole trapping rates but are
sensitive to the electron trapping rates. The proﬁles shown in Fig. 5 are simu-
lated by reducing the trapping rates by 20% with respect to the nominal rates
for reasons that will be explained in Section 5. The choice does not aﬀect the
conclusion that the measured proﬁles are inconsistent with a constant eﬀective
doping model.

4 Double Junction Models

The large number of measurements suggesting that large electric ﬁelds exist
on both sides of an irradiated silicon diode has given rise to several attempts
to model the eﬀect [3,6,17]. The most recent of these by Eremin, Verbitskaya,
and Li (EVL) [17] is based upon a modﬁcation of the Shockley-Read-Hall
(SRH) statistics. The EVL model produces an eﬀective space charge density
ρeﬀ from the trapping of leakage current by one acceptor trap and one donor
trap. The eﬀective charge density is related to the occupancies and densities
of traps as follows,

ρeﬀ = e [NDfD −

NAfA] + ρdopants

where: ND and NA are the densities of donor and acceptor trapping states,
respectively; fD and fA are the occupied fractions of the donor and acceptor
states, respectively; and ρdopants is the charge density due to ionized dopants.
Charge ﬂows to and from the trapping states due to generation and recom-
bination. The occupied fractions are given by the following standard SRH
expressions,

fD =

generation-recombination current caused by the SRH statistics for single donor
and acceptor states is given by the following expression,

Within the EVL model, the four trapping cross sections are ﬁxed to 10−15 cm2.
The leakage current is generated from an additional SRH trapping state that is

acceptor states are assumed not to generate leakage current which, given the
small size of the cross sections, is a self-consistent assumption. The densities
of the donor and acceptor states (ND and NA) are adjusted to “ﬁt” TCT data.
The parameters of the model are given in Table 2. The trap densities are scaled
to ﬂuence and are given in terms of introduction rates gint = NA/D/Φeq.

An illustrative sketch of the EVL model has been reproduced from Ref. [17]
and is shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6a shows a uniform current density ﬂowing across
a reverse-biased junction. Since holes are produced uniformly across the junc-
tion and ﬂow to the p+ backplane, the hole current density increases linearly
with increasing z from the n+ implant to the p+ implant. The electrons ﬂow
to the n+ implant and the electron current density increases with decreasing
z. The actual carrier densities depend upon the details of the ﬁelds and mo-
bilities but vary monotonically across the junctions as shown in Fig. 6b. The
trapping of the mobile carriers produces a net positive space charge density
near the p+ backplane and a net negative space charge density near the n+
implant as shown in Fig. 6c. Since positive space charge corresponds to n-type
doping and negative space charge corresponds to p-type doping, there are p-n
junctions at both sides of the detector. The electric ﬁeld in the sensor follows
from a simultaneous solution of Poisson’s equation and the carrier continuity
equations. The resulting z-component of the electric ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 6d.
It varies with an approximately quadratic dependence upon z having a min-
imum at the zero of the space charge density and maxima at both implants.

In order to test whether the electric ﬁeld predicted by the EVL model would
improve the agreement between the simulated and measured charge collection
proﬁles shown in Section 3, it was necessary to implement the EVL model
in ISE TCAD. TCAD contains a complete implementation of SRH statistics.
However, the EVL modiﬁcations of SRH are not incorporated. In particular,
any state added to generate leakage current would also trap charge. It is
possible to use the TCAD “Physical Model” interface to replace the existing
SRH implementation with a modiﬁed one, however, a less invasive approach
was adopted.

Our approach is based upon three observations:

(1) The trapping cross sections are poorly known. The cross sections for
states observed in various types of defect spectroscopy vary over several
orders of magnitude.

(2) The occupancies fD/A of the trapping states are independent of the scale
of the cross sections. If the capture cross sections σe/h in Eq. 3 are rescaled
by a factor r, then fD/A are unchanged. The occupancies depend only
upon the ratio of electron and hole cross sections, σh/σe.

(3) The current U generated by the donor and acceptor impurities is linear

in the cross section rescaling factor r.

e = σA

h = σA

e = σD

These observations imply that it is possible to implement the EVL model in
TCAD simply by setting σD
h and by varying the size of the
common cross section until the generation current is equal to the observed
or expected leakage current. The trap occupancies are not aﬀected in zeroth
order by the rescaling, but the leakage current and the free carrier densities are
aﬀected by r. The carrier densities have a ﬁrst-order eﬀect on the occupancies
so that varying r does alter ρeﬀ . This approach uses the same trapping states
to produce space charge and leakage current (it is not necessary to introduce
current-generating states).

Using the activation energies and introduction rates for the donor and acceptor
states given in Table 2, the only free parameter in the TCAD implementation
of the EVL model is the size of the common cross section or equivalently,
the leakage current. The leakage current in the test sensors was observed to
increase substantially after bump-bonding to the readout chips. Although the
cause of the increased current is not clear, it is possible that it is due to

10

increased surface/edge leakage or that it is caused by stressing the detector.
The measured leakage current, expressed in terms of the damage parameter α
[18], is listed in Table 3. It is well established [18] that in large detectors, the
10−17 A/cm for a fully
magnitude of leakage current is expected to be α0
biased detector. It is clear that the observed leakage current is approximately
ﬁve times larger than the expected value.

The EVL model was implemented in the sensor simulation using several pa-
rameter choices. The resulting charge collection proﬁles for 150V and 300V
bias voltages are shown in Fig. 7. The measured proﬁles are again shown
as solid dots. The blue histogram shows the EVL model with the leakage
current adjusted to 20% of the measured value which is comparable to the
expected leakage current (α0). It clearly substantially underestimates the col-
lected charge at both voltages. The eﬀect of increasing the leakage current to
60% of the measured value is shown as the solid red histogram. This improves
the agreement at 300V but produces too much signal in the high z tail of
the 150V distribution. Finally, in an attempt to increase the collected charge
at 300V, the introduction rates were scaled down by a factor of eight. The
common cross section was increased by the same factor to hold the leakage
current constant. The result of this is shown as the black histogram in Fig. 7.
Note that this does increase the collected charge signal, however, it is still too
small at 300V and is much too large in the tail region of the 150V distribution.
We conclude that the EVL model does not provide a quantitative description
of the measured charge collection proﬁles.

5 An Improved Two-Trap Model

Although it lead to a poor quantitative description of the measured charge col-
lection proﬁles, the EVL model does have the qualitative features needed to
describe the data. At low bias voltages, the combination of the quadratic min-
imum in the electric ﬁeld and signal trapping can act like a “gate” suppressing
the collection of charge from the p+ side of the detector. The measured proﬁle

the EVL model with the leakage current adjusted to 20% of the measured value
which is comparable to the expected leakage current (α0). The red histogram shows
the eﬀect of increasing the leakage current to 60% of the measured value. The black
histogram shows the result of decreasing the introduction rates by a factor of eight
and increasing the cross sections by the same factor.

would then appear to be a narrow peak on the n+ side of the detector. As
the bias is increased, the magnitude of the ﬁeld at the minimum would also
increase and eﬀectively “lift the gate” which would allow much more charge
collection from the p+ side of the detector.

In order to investigate whether a two-trap double junction EVL-like model
can describe the measured charge collection proﬁles, a tuning procedure was
adopted. Relaxing the EVL requirement that all trapping cross sections are
equal, the model has six free parameters (ND, NA, σD
h ) that can
be adjusted. The activation energies are kept ﬁxed to the EVL values. Addi-
tionally, as was discussed in Section 3, the electron and hole signal trapping
rates, Γe and Γh, are uncertain at the 30% level due to the ﬂuence uncertainty
and possible annealing of the sensors. They are treated as constrained param-
eters. In an ideal case, the simulation would be used to perform a χ2 ﬁt to the
measured proﬁles and optimal parameter estimates and conﬁdence intervals
would be extracted. Unfortunately, the simulation chain is quite slow. It re-
quires approximately nine hours to produce a TCAD solution for the electric
ﬁeld map and then several simultaneous Pixelav jobs (one per bias voltage) re-
quire approximately 16 hours each to produce adequate statistics. This implies
that a traditional χ2 ﬁt with a full error matrix analysis is not feasible. An
extremely tedious and less mathematically rigorous procedure was adopted in-
stead. The parameters of the double junction model were systematically varied
and the agreement between measured and simulated charge collection proﬁles
was judged subjectively.

In the course of the tuning procedure, it became clear that the EVL model does
not produce a suﬃciently large electric ﬁeld on the p+ side of the detector.

The solution to this problem is to increase the density of donors (hole traps)
as compared with the density of acceptors (electron traps). When this is done,
the z position of the minimum in the eﬀective charge density shifts toward the
n+ implant as sketched in Fig. 8a. Unfortunately, this causes the “peak” in
the 150V simulated charge proﬁle to become too narrow. The position of the
charge density minimum can be restored to a position nearer the midplane of
the detector by decreasing the ratios of the hole and electron cross sections
from 1.0 to 0.3 (σD
e = 0.3) as shown schematically
in Fig. 8b. Note that the adjustment of the cross sections for both types of
trap minimizes the ﬁeld in the quadratic minimum while allowing for large
ﬁelds at the implants. For simplicity it is assumed that the electron cross
sections are equal (σD
e = σe) and that the hole cross sections are equal
(σD
h = σh).

The current best “ﬁt” to the measured charge collection proﬁles reduces the
ratio NA/ND from the EVL value of 0.62 to 0.4. The z-component of the
simulated electric ﬁeld is plotted as a function of z in Fig. 9 for bias voltages
of 150V and 300V. The ﬁeld proﬁles, labeled dj35, have minima near the
midplane of the detector. Note that the minimum ﬁeld at 150V bias appears
to be very small but is still approximately 400 V/cm. The dj35 ﬁeld proﬁles
are compared with those that result from the rescaled EVL model which are
shown as blue solid and dashed curves (labeled as dj16). Finally, the electric
ﬁeld proﬁles resulting from a constant p-type doping of density Neﬀ = 3.5

1014 neq/cm2 ﬂuence simulation falls a below the measured
Although the 8.1
proﬁle at small y (near the n+ implant), it provides a reasonable description of
the measurements. Several features of the measured distributions are described
well by the simulation. Note that both data and simulation show a distinctly
negative signal near y = 0 µm. This can be understood as a consequence
of hole trapping. Electrons deposited near the n+ implant are collected with
high eﬃciency whereas holes deposited near the implant must transit the entire
detector thickness to reach the p+ backplane. If the holes are collected, they
produce no net signal on the n+ side of the detector. However if the holes
trap, then a negative signal is induced and is most visible in the y < 0 µm
region. Another feature is the “wiggle” in the 150V proﬁles for both low and
high ﬂuences. The relative signal minimum near y = 700 µm corresponds to
the Ez minimum where both electrons and holes travel only short distances
before trapping. This small separation induces a only a small signal on the n+
side of the detector. At larger values of y, Ez increases causing the electrons
drift back into the minimum where they are likely to trap. However, the holes
drift into the higher ﬁeld region near the p+ implant and are more likely to
be collected. The net induced signal on the n+ side of the detector therefore
increases and creates the local maximum seen near y = 900 µm.

It is likely that there was more annealing of the higher ﬂuence sample and
simple linear scaling of trap densities with ﬂuence is probably not optimal.
The accommodation of the additional annealing may require an adjustment
of the NA/ND ratio or other degrees of freedom. A second observation is that
the measured and simulated signals are absolutely normalized and the signal
observed at 450V from the high ﬂuence sample is larger than that observed
for the lower ﬂuence sample. This is surprising and may suggest that sample-
to-sample normalization issues exist or it may conﬁrm the idea that annealing
has altered the behavior of the sample.

N −2.5
D

The dj35 model ﬁxes the ratios NA/ND and σh/σe leaving the parameters
ND and σe to vary. Over a restricted range, increases in ND can be oﬀset
by decreases in σe keeping the electric ﬁeld proﬁle more or less unchanged.
Scaling the electron cross section as σe ∝
produces very similar charge
collection proﬁles. The allowed region in ND-σe space is shown in Fig. 11a as
the solid line in the logarithmic space. If the donor density becomes too small
1014 cm−3), the 150V simulation produces too much signal at large
(ND < 20
1014 cm−3), the 300V
z. If the donor density becomes too large (ND > 50
simulation produces insuﬃcient signal at large z. Since the simulated leakage
current varies as Ileak
σeND, diﬀerent points on the allowed solid contour
correspond to diﬀerent leakage current. Contours of constant leakage current
are shown as dashed curves and are labeled in terms of the corresponding
damage parameter α where α0 is the expected leakage current. It is clear that
the simulation can accommodate the expected leakage current which is smaller

Fig. 11. The allowed region in ND-σe space for model dj35 is shown as the solid

where α0 is the expected leakage current. Contours of constant electron trapping
rate are shown as dashed curves in (b) and are labeled in terms of the un-annealed
trapping rate Γ0 for the nominal ﬂuence.

The electron and hole traps in the model should also contribute to the trapping
of signal carriers. The contributions of these states to the eﬀective trapping
rates of electrons and holes are given by the following expression,

where it has been assumed that the trap occupancies are small. Because
NA/ND is assumed to be constant, contours of constant electron trapping
rate are parallel to contours of constant leakage current in ND-σe space. The
best “ﬁt” of the simulation to the measured proﬁles reduced Γe to 80% of the
un-annealed trapping rate Γ0 for the nominal ﬂuence [15]. These contours are
compared with the allowed contour in Fig. 11b. It is clear that the simulation
can accommodate the measured trapping rate in the same region of parameter
space that maximizes the leakage current.

Figure 11b also suggests a solution to the puzzle that the trapping rates have
been shown to be unaﬀected by the presence of oxygen in the detector bulk
[15] whereas it is well-established that the space charge eﬀects are quite sen-
sitive to the presence of oxygen in the material [19]. It is clear that additional
small-cross-section trapping states can play a large role in the eﬀective charge

16

density but a small one in the eﬀective trapping rates. If the formation of
the additional small-cross-section states were suppressed by oxygen, then ρeﬀ
could be sensitive to oxygenation whereas Γe/h would be insensitive to oxy-
genation. This is another consequence of the observation that the occupancies
fD/A of the trapping states are independent of the scale of the cross sections
in the steady state (see Section 4). The trapping of signal carriers is not a
steady-state phenomenon and is sensitive to the scale of the trapping cross
sections.

6 Conclusions

The main result of the work presented in this paper is that a doubly-peaked
electric ﬁeld is necessary to describe to the charge collection proﬁles measured
in heavily irradiated pixel sensors . A simulation utilizing a linearly varying
electric ﬁeld based upon the standard picture of a constant type-inverted ef-
fective charge density is inconsistent with the measurements.

A two-trap EVL-like model can be tuned to provide a reasonable description
of the measurements. It can also account for the expected level of the leakage
current (although not the observed level of leakage current) and the observed
electron signal trapping rate. It is important to state that any two-trap model
is, at best, an “eﬀective theory”. It is well-known that there are a great many
trapping states in heavily irradiated silicon. All of them can and do trap
charge. There may also be thermodynamically ionized defects that contribute
to the eﬀective space charge density. It is clear that a two-trap model can
describe the gross features of the physical processes but it may not be able
to describe all details. This also implies that the parameters of the two-trap
model presented in this paper are unlikely to have physical reality.

The charge-sharing behavior and resolution functions of many detectors are
sensitive to the details of the internal electric ﬁeld. A known response function
is a key element of any reconstruction or analysis procedure. A working eﬀec-
tive model will permit the detailed response of these detectors to be tracked
as they are irradiated in the next generation of accelerators.

Finally, we note that despite a growing body of contrary evidence, the overly
simple picture of uniform type inversion in irradiated silicon detectors per-
sists in the minds of many researchers and even in the terminology used by
experts to describe their devices. After irradiation, quantities like ℓdep (de-
pletion depth) and Neﬀ may correctly suggest reduced detector performance
but given the reality of doubly-peaked electric ﬁelds and signal trapping, they
have no physical signiﬁcance.

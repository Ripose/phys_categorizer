Abstract— A detector designed to measure early particle show-
ers has been installed in front of the central CDF calorimeter at
the Tevatron. This new preshower detector is based on scintillator
tiles coupled to wavelength-shifting ﬁbers read out by multi-
anode photomultipliers and has a total of 3,072 readout channels.
The replacement of the old gas detector was required due to
an expected increase in instantaneous luminosity of the Tevatron
collider in the next few years. Calorimeter coverage, jet energy
resolution, and electron and photon identiﬁcation are among
the expected improvements. The ﬁnal detector design, together
with the R&D studies that led to the choice of scintillator and
ﬁber, mechanical assembly, and quality control are presented. The
detector was installed in the fall 2004 Tevatron shutdown and is
expected to start collecting colliding beam data by the end of 2004.
First measurements indicate a light yield of 12 photoelectrons/MIP,
a more than two-fold increase over the design goals.

Index Terms— scintillation detectors, optical ﬁbers, calorimetry.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE physics program at the Fermilab Tevatron collider will

continue to explore the frontier of particle physics until the
startup of the LHC experiments at CERN later in this decade.
Meanwhile, in preparation for the expected large data output
from the Tevatron collider program, the instantaneous lumi-
nosity increase during the second phase of Run II and a better
detector performance require detector upgrades beyond the ones
ﬁrst planned for the start of Run II. Calorimeter performance
can be improved by replacing the old preshower gas detector
with a new detector based on scintillator technology. During
the fall 2004 Tevatron shutdown, the front face of the CDF

central calorimeter has been equipped with a new preshower
detector based on scintillator tiles and read out by wavelength-
shifting (WLS) ﬁbers. Thanks to a larger signal output from the
new detector and better signal to noise ratio, both electron and
photon identiﬁcation are expected to improve signiﬁcantly.

II. WHY A NEW DETECTOR?

T HE replacement of the Central Preshower (CPR) and

Central Crack (CCR) detectors with scintillator detector

technology is recommended for a number of reasons:
1) The old CPR is a slow wire chamber with a relatively poor
segmentation; the instantaneous luminosity has increased since
the start of Run II by a factor of ten, and a further rise is
expected in the next few years. This combination would lead to
high detector occupancy, jeopardizing good electron and photon
identiﬁcation during the most crucial period of Run II, when
the high-energy physics frontier can be explored with large data
samples before the LHC era arrives.
2) Jet energy corrections can be improved even at the current
occupancy level with an expanded detector segmentation.
3) The old gas detectors have been operating since the start
of Run I and wire aging is degrading the capability of the old
detector. Furthermore, the signal pulses from a gas detector are
small and signal response resolution is poor, when compared
to those from a scintillator detector. Both effects are of crucial
importance to electron and photon identiﬁcation and energy
resolution improvements.
4) Electron-pion separation can also be improved using a new
detector with an improved ability to detect minimum ionizing

particles (MIPs) and separate them from the background of
pions (see, for example, Ref. [1], p. 2996).

III. EXTENDING THE PHYSICS REACH

T HE CPR has already contributed to many important

physics results, especially those involving photon and
electron identiﬁcation. The upgrade of
the CDF central
calorimeter is expected to greatly improve the Run II physics
results and enhance the sensitivity to physics beyond the
standard model. In particular, it will play an important role
in soft electron tagging of b-jets, photon identiﬁcation, and
jet resolution. Jet resolution can be improved by incorporating
tracking information in the jet reconstruction algorithm [2].
Improvement of jet energy resolution can be important
in
enhancing the reach for new physics processes, such as the
Higgs boson. For the purpose of photon identiﬁcation at CDF,
the shower maximum detector alone cannot resolve single
photons from meson decays (i.e. π0 → γγ) above 35 GeV,
as the angular separation between the two photons is too
small. Instead, the CPR uses photon conversion rates which are
energy independent. Furthermore, it can be used to estimate the
backgrounds to exotic physics signals that include photons. In
fact, if present, new physics events are expected to appear in the
high transverse momentum region where the shower maximum
has no discriminatory power.

The thin gas layers of the old CCR detectors have not
been used efﬁciently due to several reasons, including low
signal response. However, the capability of tagging high energy
electrons and photons in the crack region in events which
may contain new physics is of paramount importance. For
example, if supersymmetry manifests itself, as some suggest, in
events with photons and missing transverse energy [3], a better
calorimeter coverage is highly desirable.

IV. DETECTOR DESIGN

T HE upgrade of the CDF central calorimeter [4] includes

the replacement of the CPR and CCR detectors, which
sample the early particle showers in front of the central
calorimeter (Fig. 1). The slow gas detectors, which have been
in operation since the start of Run I, have just been replaced
during the Tevatron shutdown in the fall of 2004, with a faster
scintillator version and better segmentation.

The new CPR detector is made of 20-mm thick scintillator
tiles (Fig. 2) read out through a 1-mm diameter WLS ﬁber
embedded into a groove carved on the surface of each tile.
The groove cut inside the scintillator’s surface has a 2-loop
spiral design with a cross-sectional keyhole shape in order to
maximize light collection. After exiting the tile, each WLS
ﬁber is spliced to a clear ﬁber, which terminates in a plastic
connector at the module’s edge. Optical cables, approximately
5 m long, then transport the light to a 16-channel R5900
Hamamatsu Photo-Multiplier Tube (PMT) located in the back
of the calorimeter wedge. Each detector channel (i.e. one tile)
is read out by one PMT pixel, for a total of 2,592 (480) readout
channels in the CPR (CCR) detector.

PRESHOWER AND CRACK DETECTORS.

Fig. 2

The CCR detector is replaced by a similar detector read
out through the same technique. The CCR is located behind a
10 radiation length tungsten bar, which limits the scintillator
thickness to 5 mm and covers the uninstrumented regions,
also called “cracks”, in the azimuthal angle φ present between
the calorimeter wedges. Ten tiles, approximately 5 cm wide,
cover each φ-crack with the same η-segmentation as that of the
central calorimeter of 10 towers per wedge. One WLS ﬁber is
embedded into a straight groove in each tile.

Both the CPR and the CCR detectors use the solenoid coil
and the tracking material as a radiator. The entire detector
consists of a total of 48 CPR (and 48 CCR) modules, with each
module covering the front face of one calorimeter wedge. A set

of 54 tiles forms one CPR module (Fig. 3) and is assembled
in an aluminum shell, sealed to be light-tight. The old CPR
detector had a poorer segmentation with only 16×2 towers
for each calorimeter wedge [6]. In the new CPR modules, a
continuous array of 3×18 tiles (12.5×12.5 cm2 each) spans
the face of one calorimeter wedge. The front-end electronics
uses the same readout modules previously employed by the
old detector, with only minor modiﬁcations.

histogram). The keyhole-shaped groove allows capture of light
from all sides while mantaining, at the same time, the ﬁber
inserted in place without the use of glue, thus simplifying the
assembly procedure. In order to maximize the light yield, the
scintillator tiles are also polished on all sides and wrapped in
an aluminized mylar foil, acting as a reﬂector and separator
between adjacent tiles.

V. TESTS AND DETECTOR PERFORMANCE

I N order to optimize the ﬁnal design of the detector, several

tests were performed to compare different kinds of scintilla-
tors, ﬁbers, and groove shapes. As the new detector is placed in
the space previously occupied by the old one, the dimensions
are ﬁxed and the studies were mostly aimed at maximizing the
light yield, in terms of the number of photoelectrons (pe) per
MIP detected.

The new CPR detector was designed with the goal of being
sensitive to the measurement of single particles, which requires
a minimum signal of 5 pe/MIP. Unlike the old CPR, the new
detector has no dead regions in η, thus allowing complete
coverage. On the other hand, the CCR is only designed to cover
the cracks and detect early particle showers. Preliminary tests
indicated a light yield of 7 pe/MIP at the tile exit, which allows
extension of the measurement of the electromagnetic shower
energy to the crack regions.

Different tile/ﬁber conﬁgurations have been investigated and
the results compared. Cosmic rays were used to test the tile
response to MIPs. In order to increase the sampling of the light
from the scintillator tile, a ﬁber is inserted into a groove whose
path allows loading of multiple loops. Two different groove
shapes have been compared: keyhole and square grooves. In
order to provide good optical coupling between ﬁber and
scintillator tile, optical cement was used in some tests.

In Figure 4, the light yield from a 2-loop spiral keyhole
groove (solid shaded histogram and ﬁt) compares well to the
light yield from a ﬁber glued in a 4-loop square groove (dotted

Owing to the small size of the scintillator tile, the light travels
a relatively short distance to the WLS ﬁbers. The light yield
may be increased by using a scintillator with a high dopant
concentration and a short attenuation length. WLS ﬁbers man-
ufactured by Kuraray [7] and PolHiTech [8] were compared,
and the attenuation length was measured to be approximately
5 m for both. Kuraray ﬁbers were chosen for their previous
good performance in other CDF sub-detectors. The light yield
from multiple ﬁber loops inserted into the groove reaches a
plateau when the increase of light collection is compensated
by the attenuation length of the ﬁber. The choice of two loops
for the Kuraray WLS ﬁbers is a compromise between assembly
and light yield optimization. The new CPR reads out only one
end of the ﬁber, but much of the light transmitted in the other
direction is recovered (∼30%) by mirroring that end of the
ﬁber. The Kuraray multi-clad Y11 WLS ﬁber embedded in a
2-loop spiral keyhole groove yields ∼ 30 pe/MIP at the tile exit
and is the preferred choice for the ﬁnal detector.

Two different scintillator tiles were used for comparison,
“Dubna” [9] and Bicron 408 [10]. Light yields obtained were
similar within 5% (Fig. 5). Dubna tiles are prepared with
polystyrene, a material with radiation hard properties, and were
chosen in the ﬁnal design.

The clear ﬁbers that transport the light to the multi-channel
Hamamatsu PMTs are manufactured by PolHiTech and their
attenuation length was measured to be ∼ 7 m, conforming to
speciﬁcations (Fig. 6). More than 20 km were needed for the
entire project.

PMT uniformity has been tested prior to installation and
conformed to speciﬁcations from Hamamatsu. The channel-
to-channel variation has a maximum spread of 3:1; however,
the ﬁber uses only the center of each pixel, and tests indicate
a variation of only ∼10-15% among pixels. The cross talk
between direct neighbors is ∼1-2%. The high voltage supplied
to the 192 PMTs is controlled by a CAEN [11] crate (SY527)
with eight 24-channel 932AN distributor boards. Voltages have
been adjusted to obtain approximately the same gain among
PMTs. Calibration constants have been included in a prelimi-
nary database to account for variation of the response among
different channels and will be further adjusted with colliding
beam data, once the Tevatron resumes collisions.

VI. DETECTOR ASSEMBLY

I N preparation for detector assembly, the WLS ﬁbers spliced

to clear ﬁbers and then glued into plastic connectors were
grouped in four bunches per module. The light transmission
after splicing was measured to be ∼92-93%, with good repro-
ducibility and small uncertainties. Prior to module assembly,
both ﬁbers and tiles were individually tested for light yield
uniformity using a radioactive source and visually inspected
for damage. During module assembly (Fig. 7), each tile was
ﬁrst positioned in its location and the ﬁber then inserted in
the keyhole groove and ﬁxed in place, away from the tiles’
borders. The same procedure was repeated for all tiles, moving
away from the connectors, until completion of the module.
The ﬁbers of the six farthest tiles were glued with optical
cement to increase the light yield and compensate for a longer
ﬁber path. In order to ensure good quality control of module
production, ﬁbers were again individually checked for damage
after assembly. After closing the aluminum shell with light-
tight sealant, each module was then scanned with a radioactive
source and the light yield measured for all tiles. In Figure 8, the
relative light yield response for the tiles used in the production
modules has a spread of ∼18%.

After installation, constant monitoring of detector response
was performed using cosmic rays. The response of all installed
modules was measured (Fig. 9) and preliminary estimates
indicate a light yield of 12 pe/MIP after the whole optical chain
(when the measurement is averaged over all the CPR modules),
well above the design speciﬁcations of 5 pe/MIP.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

T HE central preshower detector for the CDF experiment

was designed and built after careful consideration of the
physics issues that need to be addressed in the next few years at
the Tevatron. Particular attention was devoted to design studies
aimed at optimizing the light yield and reliability. Detector
production was completed smoothly and quality control was
performed at various stages before, during, and after the con-
struction phase. Detector installation took place during the fall
2004 in a timely fashion. Tests indicate that the ﬁnal detector
meets and exceeds design requirements. Indeed, preliminary
measurements of light yield show a two-fold increase with
respect to design goals. The calibration performed prior to
installation allows valuable monitoring of detector performance.

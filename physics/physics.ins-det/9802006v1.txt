Abstract

RAMPEX - Russian-AMerican Polarization EXperiment- is dedicated to studies of
one-spin asymmetries which have twist-3 and also twist-2 origin, in hard and semi-
hard inclusive processes on the polarized propane-diol target. A special consideration
has been given for the prospects of using polarized 3He target. The studies will be
performed at the Serpukhov accelerator at 70 GeV/c (p beam) and 40 GeV/c (π−
beam).

Key words: polarized target, magnetic spectrometer, calorimetry, DAQ, spin

1 Introduction.

RAMPEX – Russian-AMerican Polarization EXperiment– presents a program
of studies of one-spin eﬀects in hadron processes. A signiﬁcant part of the
investigations will be performed for the ﬁrst time. This program includes pp↑
interactions at 70 GeV/c, and as an option π−p↑ interactions at 40 GeV/c, at
the Serpukhov accelerator. Conceptually RAMPEX will try to form a new ap-
proach in interpreting experimental results on one-spin asymmetries in hadron
processes.

Quantum chromodynamics as a model of strong interactions is commonly used
in interpretation of experimental data. The most successful descriptions hold
for those eﬀects which correspond to the leading twist-2 contributions. These
include collider data on hard photon and jet production at large pT , on lepton
pair production with large M etc.

The higher-twist contributions are less familiar to most of physicists. The

at high initial energies. Though one-spin asymmetries were studied experi-
mentally at various energies (see for example review [1]), no special attention
was paid to the twist-3 origin of the one-spin asymmetries.

There are also subtle twist-2 eﬀects in the double inclusive processes

which have not yet been studied.

The spin theoretical community is highly interested in the new results con-
cerning these twist-3 and twist-2 hadron processes (1,2) (see review [2]). The
forthcoming RAMPEX stimulates them to formulate new concepts for one-spin
asymmetries.

Analysis of the whole set of experimental measurements which are available
between beam momenta of 6 and 200 GeV/c (for refs. see [1]), results in the
following conclusions:

– at any initial energy under study, the one-spin asymmetry can reach sizeable

– a serious enigma is the zero values of AN (pT ) in a very wide pT -interval in

E704 experiment at 200 GeV/c;

– the experimental measurements are rather mosaic, and mostly they cannot

be compared;

– a new experiment is highly desirable in which a complex physical program
can be performed on AN (xF , pT ) for diﬀerent particles and in diﬀerent kine-
matical regions.

2 Physical motivation of RAMPEX.

Normally the experimental community is familiar with the polarized parton
densities g1(x) and g2(x) probed in DIS. However the intrinsic nucleon struc-
ture is described also by other functions, of twist-2 and twist-3 in particular
(see for example [3]).

In RAMPEX we shall measure the twist-3 asymmetries in single hadron pro-
duction in (1) and we shall try to discover the more subtle twist-2 correlations

in two-particle production processes in (2). In both cases h’s denote π, K,... As
is commonly believed, the one-spin asymmetries in hard and semi-hard hadron
production processes can be used, in appropriate phenomenology, to obtain
information on new spin-dependent quark distributions hL(x) and h1(x), of
twist-3 and twist-2 respectively. They are both chiral-odd distribution func-
tions.

The relevant theoretical problems were discussed at the RAMPEX Round Table
at SPIN96 [2].

The decaying Λ-hyperons are good self-analysing polarization tools. The mea-
surment of the ﬁnal-state Λ polarization in the reaction

will allow to study the proton–Λ spin correlations. We shall also perform
ﬁrst polarization asymmetry measurements in the production processes of the
resonanses K ∗

890 and φ containing s quarks.

3 General layout.

The full version of the experimental setup includes two arms (ﬁg. 1). One
arm consists of the magnet spectrometer, two ˇCerenkov counters ˇC1, ˇC2 to
identify charged particles, an electromagnetic calorimeter EC1 and a hadron
calorimeter HC. The magnet spectrometer consists of the magnet M and ﬁve
proportional chambers PC1-PC5. In ﬁg. 1 this arm makes an angle of 9◦ with
the beam line corresponding to 90◦ in cms. This arm will be also rotated to a
smaller angle close to 0◦ to detect particles with large xF and to a larger angle
to detect particles with negative xF . Numerical estimations of acceptances and
eﬃciences show that the angle values near 80 and 300 mrad are optimal for
these measurements. The second arm of the setup consists only of the ﬁne-
granulated electromagnetic calorimeter EC2 which is placed symmetrically to
the beam line and makes angle

9◦ or smaller.

the accelerator with a bent Si crystal [4], and the measurements with this
beam will take a major part of the experimental program. The 40 GeV/c π−

of the target nuclei to the number of polarized nuclei depends on a type of

of 1 Mb. The zero level trigger is arranged to strobe information

from the trigger hodoscopes.The simplest ﬁrst level trigger for the charged arm
of the spectrometer is a signal coincidence from the two trigger hodoscopes.
A special work is made for triggering with hadron calorimeter using the pro-
sinθxi (summation over counters) to the
portionality of the signal Ex = P Ei
transverse momentum pT . The overall one-charged particle trigger has been
worked out and tested. The multi-particle trigger is in progeress. The details
of triggering can be found in [8].

3.0.0.8 First accelerator runs. The ﬁrst test run was performed in
Fall’96. The aim was to test electromagnetic calorimeter and the related sys-
tems of the programming shell. 320 of 1200 EC1 modules made of Pb+scintillator
sandwiches were examined and showed the overall energy resolution of σ = 9%/√E.

The EC1 related data acquisition was carefully tested including such elements
as read-out electronics, data ﬂow, calibration, LED based monitoring system
and HV power supply. While being tested EC1 moved in two dimensions in the
vertical plane with high accuracy controlled by a special program. The oﬀ-line
analysis was also undertaken. The results of that testing run are regarded as
quite satisfactory.
The second test run has been scheduled for March’97. The program includes
looking over the remaining 880 EC1 modules and ﬁrst tests of the tracking
system. A certain work will be made to improve parameters of the 70-GeV/c
proton beam extracted with the bent crystal in the 14th channel.
The ﬁrst data-taking is being planned for the end of the Fall’97 run suppos-
ing detection of πo and η signals. A major part of this run will be dedicated
to the further tests of the tracking system and to the ﬁrst launch of the whole
setup.

4 3He target prospects at RAMPEX.

Within any reasonable accelerator run duration, the physical capabilities of
RAMPEX is generally restricted by the properties of the polarized propane-diol
target. It becomes opaque at the beam ﬂuxes more than 107. So the luminosity
1031 cm−2spill−1 is considered as a maximum. Besides the luminosity related
k
to the collisions with the polarized protons in the target is less by a factor of
10.

·

Using the internal polarized 3He target in the 70-GeV/c proton ring would
provide new possibilities in the twist-3 and twist-2 studies at RAMPEX. In
particular, the presence of polarized neutrons will be very instructive for search
of the ﬂavor dependence of the asymmetry.

A comparison of polarization eﬀects in inclusive production of particles with
various quark content is of special interest. With the internal 3He target we
could compare one-spin asymmetries on polarized protons and polarized neu-
trons with appropriate statistics in the following reactions:

The most promising are the kinematic regions at xF = 0 and/or at the
negative xF . The one-spin asymmetry on the subprocess level which originates
from perturbative QCD is proportional to the mass of the polarized quark.
The masses of u, d quarks are negligibly small, and it is commonly believed
that the strange quarks in polarized proton are weakly polarized.

On the contrary, the one-spin asymmetry originating from the twist-3 contri-
butions is proportional to the mass parameter µhadr due to the long-distance in-
teractions [9]. As the fragmentation properties may diﬀer for pions and kaons,
1/µhadr, may also vary, thus resulting in a
the eﬀective size of this region,
ﬂavor dependence of the one-spin asymmetries.

With the 3He target the higher statistics can be achieved at the large-pT twist-
3 studies in the processes (1) and the very subtle twist-2 asymmetries in the
processes (2). The proton beam intensity in the ring is equal to Ibeam = 1013
protons per spill. The length of the spill is 9 seconds with the 2-second ﬂat part
of the maximum accelerating ﬁeld in the middle of the spill. The frequency
105
of the beam revolutions during this 2-second window is equal to n = 4
spill−1. Assuming the 3He target parameters to be the same as was reported
by the RIKEN group at SPIN96 in Amsterdam [10], that is the density of
1014 atoms/cm3 and length of 10 cm, one obtains the target density of IT

Abstract

We have analyzed data on the free ion yield observed in liquid isooctane irradiated by
60Co γ rays within the framework of the Onsager theory about initial recombination.
Several distribution functions describing the electron thermalization distance have
been used and compared with the experimental results: a delta function, a Gaussian
type function and an exponential function.

A linear dependence between free ion yield and external electric ﬁeld has been
found at low electric ﬁeld values (E < 1.2 M V /m) in excellent agreement with the
Onsager theory. At higher electric ﬁeld values we obtain a solution in power series
of the external ﬁeld using the Onsager theory.

1 Introduction

Liquid ﬁlled ionization chambers are currently used in radiotherapy both for
dosimetry ([1], [2], [3], [4]) and portal imaging [5]. One of the most commonly
used liquids is isooctane (2,2,4 trimethylpentane). This nonpolar liquid has a
quite constant stopping power ratio to water in a very wide energy spectrum
(less than 3% variation from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV [1]) and also its intrinsic
mass density allows to achieve a spatial resolution in the millimeter range for
therapy beams [5].

Free ion yield Gf i(E, T ),
is deﬁned as the number of electron-ion pairs
escaping initial recombination per 100 eV of absorbed energy, and experi-
mentally it is obtained from ionization current measurement. The knowledge
of how it varies with temperature T , with external electric ﬁeld E, and with ra-
diation type, constitutes a fundamental problem to understand the operation
of these devices. These dependences have been measured in a large number
of liquids ([6], [7]). The Onsager theory [8] describes Gf i(E, T ), and has been
tested in several liquids with good results (see for example [7]). The Onsager
theory predictes a linear relationship between ionization current and electric
ﬁeld at low electric ﬁeld values. The previous dependence can be obtained
from numerical resolution of the Onsager theory. This linear behavior has to
be extrapolated to very low electric ﬁeld strength region because volume re-
combination depletes free charge density produced by radiation in the liquid.

In the current work we describe a detailed method to apply and to test the
Onsager theory at the low ﬁeld strength region and to obtain a precise depen-
dence of Gf i with electric ﬁeld in the linear region for liquid isooctane.

2 Theoretical considerations

2.1 Onsager theory of initial recombination

When ionizing radiation interacts with a liquid, electrons released from
molecules thermalize at a distance r, where electron and positive ion are still
bounded by the Coulomb interaction. This will cause the recombination of
the primary ionization pairs produced, which is called initial recombination.
These eﬀects are much more relevant in liquids than in gases due to the fact
that mass density of liquid hydrocarbons is almost three orders of magnitude
higher than density of gases at normal conditions.

Onsager solved the problem of the Brownian movement of an electron under

the inﬂuence of both the ion Coulomb attraction and an external electric ﬁeld
E [8]. For isolated ionizations, initial recombination escape probability of an
electron-ion pair within the Onsager theory is

where r is the initial separation between electron and ion (i.e. the thermal-
ization distance), Θ is the angle between the line that initially connects the
electron-ion pair and the external electric ﬁeld. The variables r0 = e2/4πǫκT
and E0 = 2κT /er0 are the Onsager radius (the distance at which Coulomb
energy equals thermal energy κT ) and the Onsager ﬁeld (the ﬁeld that would
produce a voltage 2κT /e over a distance r0). Here ǫ is the liquid dielectric
constant (ǫ = 1.94
ǫ0 for liquid isooctane at room temperature), T is its tem-
perature and κ is the Boltzmann constant. Finally, J0 denotes the zeroth-order
Bessel function.

·

Mozumder [9] converted the integral of equation (1) in an inﬁnite series using
properties of the Bessel functions. He also eliminated the angular dependence
averaging over a uniform distribution of cos Θ. Then, the angle averaged escape
probability takes the following form,

Equation (2) is the most adequate formula for calculating escape probabilities
for arbitrary values of initial separation and external electric ﬁeld. In fact,
it will be the formula that we will use for numerical calculations of escape
probabilities. The expansion in power series of the external ﬁeld is implicit in
equation 2. If we operate in equation (2) then we can obtain it explicitly:

trons. Due to this fact a distribution function f (r), such as to
is usually introduced ad hoc to describe electron thermalization distances. Sev-
eral distribution functions had been used by diﬀerent authors in the literature
(see for example [7] and [9]). In the current article we will test the three most

The ﬁrst and second distributions are characterized by a single parameter ρ.
The Gaussian type distribution, in addition, has a dispersion parameter σ.
However, in order to obtain a single parameter distribution we will correlate
both parameters. In advance we will take σ = 0.25
ρ such as [9]. This choice
provokes that the diﬀerence between the normalization factor N, and the
normal Gaussian normalization factor 1/√2πσ, be less than 0.1%.

·

Within this framework we can write the escape probability averaged over the
thermalization distances as:

Pesc(E, T ) =

Π(r, E, T ) f (r) dr

Z0

An interesting property of the Onsager series is that the ﬁrst expansion term
of the escape probability does not depends on the thermalization distance
r. From equations (6) and (7) we can derive that when the electric ﬁeld is
suﬃciently low to verify

the n = 1 term is much higher than the n = 2 term in equation (6) (and hence

escape probability rises linearly with the electric ﬁeld:

2.2 Free ion yield calculation within the Onsager framework

Free ion yield Gf i, is deﬁned as the number of electron-ion pairs created (i.e.
those escaping initial recombination) in the ionization medium per 100 eV
of absorbed energy. This magnitude plays a similar role to the W factor in
gases. However, W is constant and free ion yield depends on temperature, on
external electric ﬁeld and on radiation type as escape probability does. Within
the Onsager theory we can write

Gf i(E, T ) = NtotPesc(E, T )

(17)

where Ntot is the total number of electron-ion pairs formed initially in the
ionization medium (i.e. before initial recombination) per 100 eV of absorbed
energy, and Pesc is the escape probability described in the previous subsection.

Free ion yield at zero external electric ﬁeld is denoted as G0
following form:

In order to measure the ionization current from an isooctane layer under irra-
diation we built a square shaped parallel plate liquid ionization chamber. The
chamber walls were fabricated using FR4 ﬁber glass reinforced epoxy copper
clad on both sides, covering a total area of 4.08 cm
4.72 cm. The FR4 thick-
ness was 0.8 mm while the copper layer was 35 µm thick. The two chamber
walls were glued on both sides of an epoxy plate spacer to provide the 0.8 mm
isooctane gap. To guarantee a constant dose rate along the gap, the detector

was inserted between two PMMA 2 plates of 5 mm and 5.8 mm thickness,
the ﬁrst one on the incident beam side. As ionization medium we used Merk’s
liquid isooctane 3 with an estimated purity of 99.8%. Figure 3 shows a scheme
of the device cross section.

Experimental tests of the chamber were made in the 60Co unit of the Complexo
Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago (CHUS). The radiation ﬁeld was set
10 cm at the isocenter 4 to cover the whole chamber. In order to
to 10 cm
obtain isooctane free ion yield we measured the ionization current produced in
the whole chamber using a nanoammeter Phillips Fluke PM 2525, for several
polarization voltages. High voltage was supplied by a CAEN N471A NIM
module.

×

Distance between the detector and the cobalt source was set to 130 cm (equiv-
alent to a dose rate around 0.4 Gy/min). The dose rate was chosen to have
a negligible volume recombination in the upper part of the ionization current
vs. voltage curve. Figure 4 shows the experimental data obtained.

If volume recombination and space charge eﬀects can be ignored, the ionization
current is proportional to the number of electron-ion pairs released in the liquid
per unit time and unit volume Nin (initial recombination is included in Nin):

To apply equation (22) we require a charge collection eﬃciency higher than
99% and also that ﬁeld screening be negligible. To calculate this limit we used
a numerical simulation of the charge carriers transport. When the distance
between the cobalt unit and the detector is 130 cm, and the polarization
voltage is higher than 600 V, general charge collection eﬃciency is higher
than 99%. This agrees with the Greening theory ([10], [11]) about general
charge collection eﬃciency. Within this theory the polarization voltage that
must be applied to obtain an eﬃciency f , is

In these equations k+ and k− are the mobilities of the positive and negative

For lower voltages the free ion yield has to be extrapolated because volume
recombination and space charge eﬀects provoke charge losses and ﬁeld screen-
ing, and equations (21) and (22) no longer hold. We expect from section 2.1
a linear relationship between the free ion yield and the electric ﬁeld at low
electric ﬁeld values. Figure 4 shows this linear relationship between 600 V and
1000 V. At higher voltages the relationship begins to deviate from linearity
as shows the ﬁgure. Then, we use data in the range 600 V
1000 V to
extrapolate the free ion yield at low electric ﬁeld region.

is valid up to E = 1.2 MV/m with a conﬁdence level of 96%. For higher values
be have to take into account more terms in the equation (6).

For isooctane the total number of electron-ion pairs produced per 100 eV
of absorbed energy is Ntot = 1.83 (also calculated with the EGSnrc code).
Inserting this value and the obtained G0
f i in equation (18 ) we can obtain
the parameter ρ, for the delta (11), Gaussian type (12) and exponential (13)

Taking the numeric values for Ntot and ρ we can calculate the theoretical pre-
diction for free ion yield within the Onsager theory using equations (17), (14)
and (2), and compare these theoretical results with experimental data. Fig-
ure 5 shows results obtained using the three considered distribution functions.
Delta and Gaussian type distributions agree with the experimental data, but
not the exponential distribution.

4 Conclusions

We have obtained and analyzed data on isooctane free ion yield irradiated
by γ photons, from a cobalt source, within the framework of the Onsager
theory. Three distribution functions (describing separation distance between
electron-ion pairs when thermalization is achieved) have been considered: a
delta function, a Gaussian type function and an exponential function. The
ﬁrst and the second describe data correctly in the covered electric ﬁeld range,
but not the exponential function.

This fact means that free ion yield depends in a fundamental way on the choice
of the distribution function, which is not predicted by the theory. The good
agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical prediction using
ρ
a delta or a Gaussian type distribution with a dispersion parameter σ = 0.25
seems to show that in this case f (r) is a Gaussian type function with a small
dispersion parameter.

·

If electron would suﬀer a large number of independent collisions before ther-
malization, a Gaussian distribution function for the thermalization distances
will agree with the central limit theorem. The lack of data about the nonpolar

11

liquids cross sections makes diﬃcult to obtain models describing the nature
of f (r). Some computer simulations have been made (see for example [13])
in this sense, however more theoretical and numerical work is needed in this
area.

On the other hand, the theoretical prediction for the intercept-to-slope ratio
Ec, is in agreement with the experimental value. This is an important result
to check the Onsager theory because it does not depend on f (r).

The authors express their gratitude to L.M. Varela from the Department of
Condensed Matter Physics from the University of Santiago for his useful com-
ments about theory of liquids.

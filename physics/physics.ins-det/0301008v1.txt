Abstract

A MicroCAT (Micro Compteur `a Trous) structure which is used for avalanche
charge multiplication in gas ﬁlled radiation detectors has been optimised with re-
spect to maximum electron transparency and minimum ion feedback. We report on
the charge transfer behaviour and the achievable gas gain of this device. A three-
dimensional electron and ion transfer simulation is compared to results derived from
electric current measurements. Similarly, we present studies of the charge transfer
behaviour of a GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) by current measurements and sim-
ulations. Finally, we investigate the combination of the MicroCAT and the GEM
by measurements with respect to the performance at diﬀerent voltage settings, gas
mixtures and gas pressures.

1 Introduction

With the rise of micropattern gas gain devices like GEM [1], MICROMEGAS
[2], CAT [3] or MicroCAT [4] the ﬁeld of application of gas ﬁlled detectors has
been widened up. These structures accept high rates and due to their parallel
plate geometry they produce short signals and good time-resolution.
Several attempts have been made in the past to enhance the gain and the re-
liability by combining micropattern structures. The performance of the com-
bination of MSGCs with GEM structures is reported in Refs. [5,6,7]. The
combinations of MSGCs and MGCs with GEM, MICROMEGAS and Plate
Avalanche Chambers are discussed in Ref. [8] with a special emphasis on rate
and gain limitations. A GEM, used as a preampliﬁcation stage, has also been
successfully combined with a Groove Chamber [9]. First results of a device
combining a MICROMEGAS and a GEM have been presented in Ref. [10].
GEM structures have been combined to double GEM [11], triple GEM and
even to quad GEM conﬁgurations [12,13], which reach an enormous gas gain
in the order of 105 − 106.
Adding a GEM to the MicroCAT structure a stable operation with respect to
sparks is obtained at moderate potentials; nevertheless quite high gas gains
are achievable at higher potentials. For this reason the detector can be oper-
ated in applications where higher gas pressures (≈ 3 bar) and high-Z gases
(like e.g. Xenon) are required, i.e. in X-ray detection, as will be shown in this
paper.
The intention of this investigation is to optimise MicroCAT- and GEM-based
detector systems for X-ray imaging (typical photon energy range: 5 − 25 keV),
where the drift gaps are usually several cm large and the drift ﬁelds are in the
range of 1 kV/cm or even less.

2 Study of the optimised MCAT215

In the past several MicroCAT structures have been investigated [4]. Recently,
an optimised MicroCAT mesh has been produced by Stork Screens 1 . In this
section we compare the charge transfer derived from current measurements to
simulations, and we demonstrate that the new device is superior to previously
investigated MicroCAT structures with respect to maximum electron trans-
parency (to maximise the eﬀective gain) and minimum ion feedback (to avoid
ﬁeld perturbations in the drift region).

25 mm above the GEM structure.

2.1 Characteristics

The MicroCAT structure (see Fig. 1) has been optimised with respect to
maximum electron transparency and minimum ion feedback while retaining a
good mechanical stability [14]. The parameters of the newly built device are
given together with those of previously used MicroCATs in Table 1. The holes
which have a hexagonal shape with edges rounded by the production process
form a hexagonal lattice. The cathode distance between the MicroCAT and
the subjacent anode amounts to d = (130 ± 10) µm (see Fig. 2), which is
in fact very close to the optimum distance of about 100 µm with respect to
maximum time-resolution. The anode is realised by an interpolating resistive
readout structure [15,16]. The drift region has a height of 27 mm (since the

3

GEM structure is not mounted). For all measurements in this section the
detector volume is ﬁlled with a gas mixture of 1 bar Ar/CO2 (90/10).
The charge transfer behaviour of the MicroCAT depends only on the ratio
η = Edrift/EMCAT of the ﬁelds above and below the mesh. This has been
conﬁrmed by simulations [14].

2.2 Charge transfer behaviour

(1)
(2)
(3)

(4)

For the determination of the charge transfer the measurement of at least two
of the following three currents is neccessary:

Idrift = I0 + δ · ε · (G − 1) · I0

IMCAT = −(1 − ε) · I0 + (1 − δ) · ε · (G − 1) · I0
Ianode = −ε · G · I0

with I0 as the incoming current:

I0 = R ·

· e .

Eγ
W

Here, ε denotes the electron transparency, δ the ion feedback, which describes
the fraction of ions drifting back to the drift cathode, G the gas gain, R the
photon rate, Eγ the mean energy deposited by the photons in the detector, W
the mean ionisation potential of the gas atoms/molecules and e the elementary
charge.
Since Eqs. 1-3 fulﬁll current conservation, equivalent to P I = 0, only two
of the three relations are independent and thus not suﬃcient to determine
all three unknown variables ε, δ and G. Therefore, one additional condition
is required, which we determine by the simulation presented in the following
paragraph.

2.2.1 Simulations

The electric ﬁelds for the MicroCAT structures have been calculated in three
dimensions using the Maxwell package [17]. The charge drift was calculated
using the Garﬁeld program [18]. The gas properties used for the Garﬁeld sim-
ulation like electron diﬀusion or drift velocity are calculated by the Magboltz
program [19,20]. The distance between the lower side of the MCAT and the
anode has been set to 100 µm, the MCAT voltage to −450 V while the anode
structure has zero potential, leading to an average electric ﬁeld in the ampli-
ﬁcation gap of EMCAT = 45 kV/cm. All potentials are assumed to be constant
during the simulation since the change of the potential during one multiplica-
tion process due to charge motion in the real detector is calculated to be in

the order of O(mV).
Diﬀusion has been included for the drifting electrons but neglected for the ions
since this contribution is expected to be small. Charge multiplication has not
been considered. The ion feedback simulation is based on an eﬀective size of
the ion cloud of about σ = 30 µm. A more detailed description of the charge
transfer simulation can be found in Ref. [14].
The results of the simulation for the electron transparency ε and ion feed-
back δ are shown in Fig. 3 as a function of the ratio η = Edrift/EMCAT for
ﬁxed EMCAT. As expected, the ion feedback increases with η but the electron
transparency decreases.

2.2.2 Measurements and comparison with simulations

We have measured the electric currents at all electrodes as a function of the
ratio η = Edrift/EMCAT with the settings EMCAT ≈ 49 kV/cm and d = 130 µm.
Due to technical reasons the measurements of ε and δ are restricted to small
values of η below about 0.03. In Section 4 the range of η is extended to larger
values of about 0.16.
From the measured currents we compute the eﬀective gain Geﬀ using the re-
lations 1–3:

Geﬀ = ε · G =

Idrift + IMCAT
I0

.

(5)

The gain variation due to the increasing drift ﬁeld in the investigated range
of η has been calculated with Garﬁeld for electrons starting 100 µm above
the MCAT along the symmetry axis of a hole to be less than 2 %. Therefore,
the measured product ε · G is expected to follow the simulation of ε. In Fig.
4 where we compare the measurement with the simulation, we observe that
contrary to the simulation the measured product drops at small values of

η. We attribute this eﬀect to attachment of the primary electrons and to
recombination with back drifting positive ions. These eﬀects which have not
been considered in the simulation seem to be negligible at higher drift ﬁelds
corresponding to η > 0.02. We derive an eﬀective electron transparency ε (see
Fig. 4) by normalising the measured ε · G to the simulation of ε at η = 0.02.
The systematic uncertainty of this procedure is indicated in the ﬁgure by the
enlarged error bars.
We also compare the ion feedback δ with the measurement using the reasonable
approximation G ≫ 1:

δ ≈

Idrift − I0
Idrift + IMCAT

.

(6)

The measurement deviates considerably from the simulation at small η illus-
trated in Fig. 5. Obviously, our model is too coarse in this region of η.

2.2.3 Comparison with other MicroCAT types

Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the measured eﬀective electron transparency ε
of four MicroCAT structures with dimensions summarised in Table 1. The
optimised mesh oﬀers the largest electron transparency. The drop of the ef-
fective electron transparency at low η is diﬀerent for the diﬀerent MicroCATs
because the amount of gas impurities slightly varies from measurement to
measurement.
The comparison of the ion feedback δ of the MicroCAT structures (see Fig.
7) shows, that the fraction of back drifting ions of the optimised MCAT215
structure is nearly as small as for the old MCAT215 structure and lower than
that of the MCAT155 device, although the electron transparency ε of the op-
timised mesh is much larger than that of the competing devices (compare to
Fig. 6).

2.3 Charge multiplication behaviour

Knowing the transparency ε, the gas gain G can be calculated from Eq. 5:

G =

Idrift + IMCAT
ε · I0

.

(7)

Fig. 8 shows the gain G as a function of the MCAT voltage. It has been
obtained from the observed pulse heights of an 55Fe-source where the gain
had been calibrated at one voltage to the current measurement. The maximum
gain, which we deﬁne as the gas ampliﬁcation, that can be reached within a
discharge limit of less than 1 spark/30 s, is in the order of 2 · 104.

2.4 Conclusion

The comparison of the optimised and the three previously investigated Micro-
CAT structures shows that the new mesh is superior with respect to electron
transparency. The ion feedback of the optimised structure is in a reasonable
range (< 8 % up to η = 0.025). In order to reach maximum eﬀective gain the
optimised device should be operated with ratios η ≈ 0.02 of the ﬁelds above
and below the MCAT. A maximum gain of about 2 · 104 can be obtained at
atmospheric pressure for Argon gas mixtures.

3 Study of the GEM

The charge transfer and gas gain behaviour of the GEM is investigated by
simulations and current measurements to obtain the optimum operation pa-
rameters in view of a combination of the GEM with the MicroCAT. The

inﬂuence of diﬀerent voltage settings and gas mixtures and pressures has been
studied.

3.1 Characteristics

The GEM structure is ﬁxed above the MicroCAT at a distance of 2 mm
(see Fig. 2). The MicroCAT serves as anode with a slightly positive voltage
(UMCAT ≈ +5 V). In this geometry the drift region above the GEM amounts
to about 25 mm, the region below the gas electron multiplier corresponds to
the distance to the MicroCAT structure, consequently 2 mm. We denote the
electric ﬁeld above and below the GEM with drift ﬁeld and transfer ﬁeld, re-
spectively.
The GEM [21] (see Fig. 9), itself, has a hexagonal hole arrangement with a
pitch of 140 µm, an optical transparency of about 12 % and a total thickness
of 60 µm (see Fig. 10).
The current measurements have been carried out with a 55Fe-source, colli-
mated to 5 mm2, emitting photons with a rate of about 45 kHz.

3.2 Charge transfer behaviour

The charge transfer behaviour of the GEM can be described by four current
equations. Two electron transparencies are introduced: ε1 is the probability,
that the electrons, coming from the drift/conversion region, reach the centre
of a GEM hole; ε2 is the probability, that these electrons reach the anode.
This approach has already been introduced by other groups (see for example

Current conservation reduces these equations to three independent relations.
In the following we make use of the eﬀective gain which is deﬁned by Geﬀ =
ε1 · ε2 · G.

3.2.1 Simulations

Like in the previous section the three-dimensional electric ﬁeld in the GEM ge-
ometry and the charge transfer behaviour have been investigated with Maxwell
and Garﬁeld, respectively. For the transparency simulation the charge multi-
plication process has not been considered; ion feedback simulations have not
been carried out.
If not stated diﬀerently, we have assumed in the simulations a drift ﬁeld of
Edrift = 500 V/cm, a transfer ﬁeld of Etrans = 2000 V/cm, a GEM voltage of
∆UGEM = 450 V and a gas mixture of 1 bar and 2.5 bar Ar/CO2 (90/10).

3.2.1.1
Inﬂuence of the drift ﬁeld: The dependency of the electron
transparencies ε1 and ε2 on the applied drift ﬁeld (100 V/cm ≤ Edrift ≤
1000 V/cm) is shown in Fig. 11. All electrons reach the centre of the hole
in the GEM structure (ε1 = 1), independent of the chosen gas pressure. The
parameter ε2 is not inﬂuenced noticeably by the drift ﬁeld. The deviation of

ε2 between the two gas pressures can be explained by the smaller electron
diﬀusion at higher pressure.
The situation is very diﬀerent from that in particle physics applications where
usually due to rather high drift ﬁelds ε1 is smaller than 100 %. In our case the
overall electron transparency is obviously limited by diﬀusion eﬀects which
cause a large fraction of electrons to be caught by the lower electrode.
We have also studied the eﬀect of drift ﬁeld variations on the gain G. The gain
was calculated with Garﬁeld for one electron starting 100 µm above the GEM
along the symmetry axis of a hole. The smallest gain Gnorm(Edrift), which is
obtained at a drift ﬁeld of Edrift = 100 V/cm, is normalised to 1. The gain
increases by about 5 % in the investigated drift ﬁeld range.

3.2.1.2
Inﬂuence of the transfer ﬁeld: The electron transparencies
ε1 and ε2 as a function of the applied transfer ﬁeld (500 V/cm ≤ Etrans ≤
6000 V/cm) are shown in Fig. 12. The transparency ε1 is constant ≈ 100 %
for all applied transfer ﬁelds, whereas ε2 shows a strong increase with rising
transfer ﬁelds. Smaller electron diﬀusion at higher pressure leads to a larger
ε2. Fig. 12 also shows the normalised gain Gnorm as a function of the transfer
ﬁeld. The change at low transfer ﬁelds is about 5 %/(1000 V/cm); identical
as observed with a variation of the drift ﬁeld (see Fig. 11). At transfer ﬁelds
Etrans & 4000 V/cm the parallel plate ampliﬁcation starts in the gap between
the GEM and the anode plane, resulting in an additional contribution to the
gain G.

Inﬂuence of the GEM voltage: The dependence of the electron
3.2.1.3
transparencies on the applied GEM voltage (50 V ≤ ∆UGEM ≤ 500 V) has
been studied (see Fig. 13). The transparencies ε1 and ε2 depend only weakly

on the GEM voltage. For very low GEM voltages ε1 decreases because the
drift channel through the GEM holes becomes wider. Smaller diﬀusion at
a gas pressure of 2.5 bar results in a larger electron transparency than for
atmospheric pressure. The calculated GEM gain G has the typical exponential
shape with increasing operation voltage.

3.2.2 Measurements and comparison with simulations

A gas mixture of Ar/CO2 (90/10) at a pressure of 1 bar was chosen for most of
the measurements if not stated diﬀerently. In addition, the charge transfer and
multiplication behaviour was investigated for several Argon, Krypton, Xenon
and CO2-quench gas mixtures at various pressures up to 2.5 bar.
From Eqs. 8–11 the product ε1 · G, the transparency ε2 and the ion feedback
δ (using the reasonable approximation G ≫ 1) can be calculated:

attachment eﬀects which are expected to increase with gas pressure. The sim-
ulation (see Fig. 11) indicates that the gain G slightly depends on the drift
ﬁeld, whereas the transparency ε1 = 1 is constant. Therefore the measured
electron transparency ε1 can be assumed to be very close to 100 %.
The measurements show that the transparency ε2 does not change noticeably
with the varying drift ﬁeld (see Fig. 15). This is in line with expectation and
simulation. However, the transparency ε2 is apparently overestimated in the
simulation, which means that in reality more electrons move to the GEM-
bottom electrode. Possible explanations of this eﬀect could be:

(1) neglection of the avalanche development in the simulation: repulsive forces

and UV-photons widen the electron cloud.

(2) underestimation of the electron diﬀusion at high electric ﬁelds in Mag-

boltz.

The measured ion feedback δ of the GEM is presented in Fig. 16 for several
gas pressures of Kr/CO2 (90/10). It increases nearly linearly with rising drift
ﬁeld.

Inﬂuence of the transfer ﬁeld: The measured increase of ε1 · G
3.2.2.2
with rising Etrans (see Fig. 17) is in a good agreement with the increase of the
gain G which was predicted by the simulation (compare to Fig. 12). Thereby
the simulated gain had to be renormalised because of the inaccurate knowledge
of the corresponding Townsend coeﬃcients. We conclude that ε1 is not sizeably
inﬂuenced by the transfer ﬁeld.
However, the transparency ε2 increases strongly with rising transfer ﬁelds (see
Fig. 18). The deviation of the absolute values of ε2 between simulation and
measurement has already been discussed in section 3.2.2.1. For transfer ﬁelds

Etrans & 4000 V/cm the parallel plate ampliﬁcation underneath the GEM leads
to an apparent rise of ε2 which is more pronounced in the measurement due to
the longer multiplication path of 2 mm compared to 100 µm in the simulation.
The measured ion feedback δ (see Fig. 19) is approximately constant at lower
transfer ﬁelds. When the parallel plate ampliﬁcation produces a noticeable
amount of gain (at large transfer ﬁelds) the ion feedback rises. We conclude
that the ion feedback is larger for ions which are produced below the GEM
rather than in the GEM holes.

GEM ﬁelds the electron drift channel becomes very narrow. As a consequence
the probability that electrons diﬀuse to one of the dense drift lines that end
on the GEM bottom electrode is increased.
The ion feedback as a function of the GEM voltage is shown in Fig. 22. Due
to very small currents at the drift cathode at low gains the error bars are very
large. The deviations from a constant behaviour are not signiﬁcant.

(shown as an example for a Xe/CO2 (90/10) gas mixture in Fig. 23). This eﬀect
is studied in more detail in Ref. [23].

3.4 Conclusion

The approach of the introduction of the two electron transparencies ε1 and ε2
has been sensibly conﬁrmed by our measurements.
The systematic studies of the currents at the electrodes in a wide range of
voltages and electric ﬁelds show the following results:

17

d
• The transparencies ε1 and ε2 do not depend signiﬁcantly on the drift ﬁeld
for Edrift . 1 kV/cm. The ion feedback δ rises nearly linearly with increas-
ing drift ﬁeld. In order to avoid electron losses due to recombination and
attachment in the conversion region the drift ﬁeld should not be chosen
too small, especially for higher gas pressures. The gain G rises slightly with
increasing drift ﬁeld.

• The transfer ﬁeld has no inﬂuence on the electron transparency ε1 in the
investigated ﬁeld range Etrans . 6 kV/cm. The transparency ε2 strongly
rises with increasing transfer ﬁelds. The ion feedback δ does not change
noticeably for small transfer ﬁelds and increases slightly for higher transfer
ﬁelds. Also the gain G rises with increasing transfer ﬁeld.

• Very small GEM voltages lead to a decrease of ε1. The transparency ε2
decreases slightly for large potential diﬀerences, whereas the ion feedback δ
is nearly constant.

4 The combination of the optimised MicroCAT with the GEM

The combination of the optimised MCAT215 and the GEM has been inves-
tigated by current measurements to determine the optimum voltage settings
with respect to maximum eﬀective gain and minimum ion feedback. The max-
imum gas gain in diﬀerent gas environments has beed studied. No simulations
have been carried out. However, the results of the individual simulations from
Sections 2 and 3 can be combined.

4.1 Characteristics

Fig. 2 shows the schematic setup of the combination of MicroCAT and GEM.
We call the electric ﬁeld between the drift cathode and the GEM by Edrift, the
ﬁeld between the GEM and the MCAT by Etrans and between the MCAT and
the anode by EMCAT ≡ UMCAT/d, where UMCAT denotes the voltage applied
to the MCAT and d = 130 µm the distance between MCAT and anode. The
ratio of the ﬁelds above and below the MicroCAT structure is denoted by
η = Etrans/EMCAT. The electron transparency, ion feedback and gain of the
MicroCAT are denoted by εMCAT, δMCAT and GMCAT, respectively. All GEM
transparencies are denoted as in the previous section, the GEM gain is denoted
by GGEM. The total eﬀective gain is deﬁned as follows:

Geﬀ = ε1 · ε2 · εMCAT · GGEM · GMCAT

Fig. 24. Measured relative pulse height as a function of the transfer ﬁeld Etrans for

4.2 Charge transfer behaviour

Fig. 24 shows the relative signal pulse heights as a function of the transfer ﬁeld
for a drift ﬁeld of Edrift = 500 V/cm, a GEM voltage of ∆UGEM = 400 V, an
MCAT voltage of UMCAT = −510 V at a gas pressure of 1 bar Ar/CO2 (90/10).
Up to transfer ﬁelds of Etrans ≈ 3000 V/cm the signal pulse height rises. The
subsequent plateau reaches up to Etrans ≈ 4000 V/cm, before the signals get
smaller again. At very high transfer ﬁelds of Etrans & 5000 V/cm parallel plate
ampliﬁcation between GEM and MicroCAT starts, which again leads to an
increase of the signals’ pulse heights.
The shape of this curve is aﬀected by two opposite eﬀects: on the one hand
the transparency ε2 of the GEM rises for increasing transfer ﬁelds (compare
to Fig. 18), and on the other hand the electron transparency εMCAT of the
MicroCAT drops for larger values of η (compare to Fig. 3). With the knowledge
of ε2(Etrans), determined in section 3, the electron transparency of the MCAT
can be calculated up to values of η ≈ 0.2. The result is shown in Fig. 25. It
agrees perfectly with the transparency measured directly with the MicroCAT
alone (see Fig. 4). Measurements at diﬀerent GEM voltages show the same
results. However, a large deviation from the simulation is obvious for η &
0.04. The measured transparency εMCAT is signiﬁcantly smaller than what the
simulation predicts. We have no explanation for this eﬀect.
By means of current relations and the reasonable assumptions, that ε1 = 1,
GGEM ≫ 1 and GMCAT ≫ 1 the ion feedback δMCAT of the MicroCAT can be
determined:

δMCAT ≈ 1 −

(compare to Fig. 5). Despite the coarse model for the ion feedback simula-
tion the simulation and the measurement match very well for larger ratios η.
Additional measurements have shown that the ﬁeld in the conversion region
Edrift . 1 kV/cm above the GEM has no inﬂuence on the ion feedback δMCAT.
Fig. 27 shows, that the total ion feedback δ = −Idrift/Ianode is getting more
favourable for higher transfer ﬁelds. The GEM voltage has no strong eﬀect on
the total ion feedback δ (see Fig. 28). The increase of the total ion feedback
δ with decreasing MCAT voltage (see Fig. 29) can be explained by the rising
contribution of the ion feedback δMCAT, which gets larger for higher ratios
η = Etrans/EMCAT (compare to Fig. 26).

Fig. 30. Measured eﬀective gain Geﬀ as a function of the transfer ﬁeld Etrans.

4.3 Charge multiplication behaviour

The eﬀective gain Geﬀ (see Eq. 15) of the GEM/MicroCAT-combination can
be calculated from the measured currents I0 (see Eq. 4) and Ianode as follows:

Geﬀ = −

Ianode
I0

The eﬀective gain as a function of the transfer ﬁeld rises to maximum at
Etrans ≈ 3.6 kV/cm in 1 bar Ar/CO2 (90/10) (see Fig. 30).
In order to study the maximum gas gain a systematic investigation of the
eﬀective gain Geﬀ as a function of the gas pressure has been carried out for
diﬀerent noble gas/quench gas mixtures. The GEM voltages are chosen such,
that this fragile pre-ampliﬁcation device always works in a safe range, whereas
the MCAT produces the main ampliﬁcation. This method has the advantage
that all discharges appear below the MicroCAT structure, which is not easily
damaged by sparks. All sparks appear at a deﬁned avalanche size depending
on the gas mixture and pressure used, but independent on the voltage settings
on GEM or on MCAT.
The measurements of the maximum gas gain are carried out for gas pressures
up to 2.5 bar. Fig. 31 shows the measured maximum gain for several pressures
of Kr/CO2 (90/10) and Xe/CO2 (90/10). In a ﬁrst approximation the drop of
the gain for higher pressures is approximately exponential. The results of the
exponentially ﬁtted data are shown in Fig. 32. The largest gas gain of about
2·105 can be achieved with the gas mixture of Ar/CO2 (90/10). At atmospheric
pressure the gain decreases with the atomic number of the nobel gas. We
estimate that for gas pressures up to 4 bar gains of at least Geﬀ,max > 2 · 103
can be reached, even for Xe-mixtures.

4.4 Conclusion

The investigation of the optimum voltage settings for a GEM/MicroCAT-
combination leads to the following results:

• To avoid recombination and attachment eﬀects the drift ﬁeld above the
GEM should be chosen larger than 500 V/cm. Higher gas pressure requires
larger drift ﬁelds (compare to Section 3 and Fig. 14).

• A transfer ﬁeld in the range of 3000 − 4000 V/cm ensures a maximum eﬀec-

tive gain and a small total ion feedback.

23

• Since the combined gain of the GEM and the MicroCAT is limited and
because the GEM is easily destroyed by discharges the MicroCAT should
be operated at much higher gain than the GEM.

The maximum gas gain decreases with pressure and atomic number of the
noble gas. A stable operation with gains in the order of 104 can be obtained
even for Xenon gas mixtures up to 2.5 bar.

5 Conclusion

The new optimised MicroCAT structure is superior to all other MicroCAT
devices with respect to electron transparency. The ion feedback of the new
mesh is smaller than for the MCAT155 and nearly as good as for the old
MCAT215 structure. Gas gains of larger than 2 · 104 can be achieved in Argon
gas mixtures at standard pressure.
In our special detector setup a GEM has been investigated with respect to
its charge transfer and gas gain behaviour with diﬀerent voltage settings and
diﬀerent gas environments. The charge transfer simulations are well conﬁrmed
by the measurements. A sub-division of the overall electron transparency into
the two transparencies ε1 and ε2 is reasonable. The achieved gains of the GEM
are comparable to published results.
The combination of both gas gain devices leads to a very high gas gain at
atmospheric pressure and a reliable detector operation with gains in the order
of 104 in Xenon gas mixtures at higher pressures of about 2.5 bar. The GEM
can be operated in a very safe gas gain mode, whereas the the MicroCAT
produces the largest amount of gain; due to the robustness of the nickel mesh
and its insensitivity against sparking no destruction of this device needs to
be feared. The fraction of back drifting ions is in the order of a few percent
when MicroCAT and GEM are combined. Therefore, spatial reconstruction
distortions due to space charge eﬀects in the conversion region are expected
to be small.

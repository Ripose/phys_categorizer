Abstract

We have designed low noise temperature sensing and control units with the

objective of using them for the fabrication of far infrared active cavity radiometers.

The sensing unit, ﬁrst characterized at 300 K using industrial platinium resistance

thermometers, has a noise level of ∼ 25 − 30 µKef f for a 3 hours measuring time

and in a 1 Hz bandwidth. Using YBCO superconducting thermometers, the noise

level goes down to 2.5 µKef f , which is strongly limited by excess 1/f noise in

the YBCO ﬁlm at the superconducting transition. The sample holder used in the

90 K experiments is built with an auxiliary heating resistor, which enables an easy

and accurate identiﬁcation of the electrothermal model, even in the closed loop

operation. Based on a design previously published by NIST, we estimate from

these experimental results that the overall noise limitations of radiometers could

be lowered by one order of magnitude.

1 INTRODUCTION

The performances of electrical-substitution radiometers (ESR) depend mainly on low

noise temperature control. Such instruments have been developed for various radio-

metric measurement purposes, including, for example, the measurement of the Stefan-

Boltzmann constant1,2, and the long-term monitoring of the solar irradiance3, and are

used as primary standards of optical power at national standards laboratories4,5. In

these experiments, an optical absorber-receiver is thermally isolated from a tempera-

ture regulated heat sink by a weak thermal link and is alternately heated by the unknown

radiant power and by the resistive heater (Joule heating). The incident radiant power

entering the aperture of the absorber-receiver can be deduced from the measurement of

the equivalent electrical power needed to ensure the same temperature rise for the two

heating effects. The resolution of the ESR was so far mainly limited by the tempera-

ture stability of the receiver. Thus, two temperature controllers, one for the heat sink

and the other for the receiver, have been proposed to improve the ESR6. Our work is

inscribed in this framework, and we report in this paper on the progress we made on

the temperature control of the heat sink using a low noise switched electronics and an

optimized analog PID. Furthermore a heat perturbation method is presented to clearly

specify the long time limitation of the system.

This paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 describes the experimental setup and pre-

liminary measurements at room temperature. The third section relates a set of improve-

ments and measurements at liquid-nitrogen temperature. In section 4, the perspectives

for the ESR performance improvements are presented.

2 READ-OUT ELECTRONICS AND EXPERIMEN-

TAL SETUP AT ROOM TEMPERATURE

2.1 Read-out electronics for a standard platinium resistor

The fundamental Johnson noise limitation of a metallic thermistor such as an Indus-

trial Platinium Resistance Thermometer (IPRT), 100 Ω thermistor with α = 1/R

×
10−3 K−1, leads to an rms value of the noise equivalent temperature

dR/dT = 3.85

×

(NET) of σ = 4.2 µKef f within a 1 Hz bandwidth (ﬁrst order) at 1 mA bias current,

or equivalently, 26 µKpp around an ideally stable thermostat at room temperature. The
required resolution for the read-out electronics is in the 10−7 range (i.e. 71/2 digits or

25 bits resolution). The home made read-out electronics presented here was designed

to be within a factor 2 of such resolution at low cost. The read-out electronic system is

presented in Fig. 1.

An elementary Wheastone DC-bridge (or AC-bridge) is often used in resistance mea-

surements, and lead resistances can be compensated with special bridge connections,

as in the “Mueller bridge”7. To improve the temperature measurement, different ways

have been investigated in the literature, which decrease the noise equivalent tempera-

ture of the system8. Our circuit is derived from low-noise electronics designed for as-

tronomical bolometric measurements. It consists of a square wave bias current source,

a low temperature-coefﬁcient resistance, a low-noise preampliﬁer stage, a lock-in am-

pliﬁer and a 2nd order Butterworth ﬁlter. The periodic bias current avoids some con-

tamination of the useful signal by low frequency electrical noise. The square wave bias

is used in order to keep constant the electrical power dissipated in the thermistor, unlike

the sine wave bias9. Consequently, the temperature of the thermistor does not oscillate.

Indeed, in the sine wave bias case, a modulated applied power, at 2fo, is dissipated in

the thermistor. Moreover, in order to avoid parasitic harmonic components, the mod-

ulation frequency fo has to be higher than the bolometer thermal cutoff frequency fth

fth).

(fo ≫
The high precision voltage reference AD588 was chosen because of its low output

3

noise, typically 6 µVpp over the 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz frequency ranges, of its long-term

stability at ambiant temperature (

15 ppm/1000 hours) and of its low output volt-

∼
2 ppm K−1). It was conﬁgured to provide a

age drift (

the desired square wave voltage at frequency fo around a few kHz. As shown in Fig. 1,

the bias voltage is applied to two high precision resistive dividers, one of which in-

cludes the high sensitivity thermistor Rth, and the other includes a low TCR resistance
50 ppm K−1, a few tens of ohms). It has to be noted that the electrical power

R (

≤ ±

dissipated in the thermometer has to be much lower than 1 mW in order to limit self

heating effects10. Additionally, the value of the injection resistor, Rl, has to be very
large compared to the thermistor resistance Rth in order to form a current source11.

This injection resistor was ﬁxed at 6 kΩ thus leading to a 0.83 mA current through Rth

100 Ω impedance) and R.

(

∼

An injection resistor was preferred to a capacitance even if the capacitance is some-

times preferred because it does not generate Johnson noise12. In that case, the capaci-

tance is fed using a triangular wave voltage, which induces a square wave current. This

triangular wave voltage may be obtained using an active integrator circuit. Although

no Johnson noise takes place through the capacitance, the system stability is dependant

on the capacitance and the use of an additional ampliﬁer may also increase the noise

level. In order to ensure stability together with the low noise requirement, we therefore

decided to use a square wave voltage through the low value thermistor and the low TCR

reference resistor R.

The preampliﬁer stage is made using an instrumentation ampliﬁer (SSM2017) followed

by a lock-in ampliﬁer. The reference signals are applied to the lock-in ampliﬁer built

around an AD620 and JFET switching connections. Finally, a Butterworth ﬁlter (2nd-

order) shapes the useful output signal of the battery-operated power device. Using the

α value of an IPRT, the voltage-to-temperature responsivity of the system at the input
ℜi is then 320 µV K−1. The white noise around the frequency fo is mainly dominated
by the Johnson noise of Rth and R. It can be estimated as en = √2√4kBT R with the

4

R value chosen close to Rth at the working temperature. Adding the ampliﬁer noise,

2.2 Read-out electronic characterization

2.2.1 Noise of the system

First, a study of the read-out electronic system where the thermistor was replaced

by an other low TCR resistor has been carried out. The system exhibited an excess

low frequency noise regim close to a “1/f ” one as clearly seen in the comparative

Fig. 11(c). Then, the deduced noise equivalent temperature spectrum (NET) would be

comprised between 6/√f µK Hz−1/2 and 10/√f µK Hz−1/2 if an ideal IPRT was

used at 0.83 mA. The associated rms value is in the range 16

30 µKef f , 2 times

−

higher than expected in Sec. 2.1 in the white noise regime. Deviation from the white

noise and the 1/f law in the read-out electronic system could be due to the electronic

system temperature that slowly drifts according to the surrounding laboratory temper-

ature. The temperature compensating coefﬁcients were estimated by measuring the

electronic boards temperature during heating or cooling the whole electronic systems.

Temperature coefﬁcients of the three read-out electronic systems were found to be:

10−4 V K−1, respec-

tively. These coefﬁcients are consistent with the observed output drift. Temperature

drifts in the range of 40 µK s−1 at the PC board level were then estimated. They must

be avoided or compensated to minimize the output drifts, which are known to lead to

an excess noise differing from a 1/f regime, with a higher 1/f n power.

2.2.2 Room temperature measurement tests

The temperature-coefﬁcient resistance (TCR), noted α, and the dimensionless slope of

the thermometer A, deﬁned as A = d ln R/d ln T = αT , are generally used to compare

different thermometers operated at different temperatures. The Standard Platinium Re-

sistance Thermometer (SPRT) is used to deﬁne the ITS90 (International Temperature

Scale of 1990) between the triple point of hydrogen (13.8023 K) and the freezing point

of silver (1234.94 K) with an accuracy of

10−3 K to

7.0

10−3 K13. How-

In the industrial platinium resistance thermometer (IPRT), the platinium wire is encap-

sulated within a ceramic housing or a thick ﬁlm sensor is coated onto a ceramic surface.

The protection from the environment is increased with a metal sheath. A Correge IPRT

was used in this present work. This class A device is characterized by an accuracy of

0.15 K at 273 K and an average TCR of 3.85

10−3 K−1 (European standard) be-

±
tween 273.16 K to 373.16 K (according to DIN CEI 751 norm). This sensing element

×

has a 100 Ω impedance at 273.16 K (triple point of water). The room temperature setup

includes three IPRT thermometers radially set out on a good heat conductor plate (cop-

per), several copper heat shields, and a heater resistance RH . A coolant (oil) is used

to minimize temperature gradients across the system. A correlation study between two

temperature measurements was then possible using this arrangement. The most impor-

tant parameters of merit of the thermometers we used are gathered in Table 1.

The temperature measurements were made with two read-out electronic systems, each

using an IPRT as thermistor. The third IPRT was measured using the conventional

four-wire method resistance measurement, performed with an HP3034A multimeter

(61/2 digits, 2 s integration time). It is hereafter called the reference IPRT thermometer.

Responsivity estimations at the output

ℜo = ∂Vout/∂T were made using the slow dc
drift of the temperature cell, assuming that the reference IPRT thermometer is well

calibrated (see Fig. 2). Note the good temperature stability: the temperature drift ∆T

was only 25 mK for 12000 s measurement. Output responsivity for each read-out

electronic system was about 10 V K−1.

6

A ﬂuctuation estimation has been made using a polynomial ﬁt up to the fourth order

to remove the main part of the cell temperature drift. The result is shown in Fig. 3.

The ﬁtting operation explains the quasi-periodic temperature artifacts evolutions, but

the fact that the three responses are still coherent between themselves on Fig. 3 indi-

cates that the resolution of the thermometers is better than the amplitude of the artifact

modulation, i.e.

200 µK. To better estimate the resolution of the high sensitivity

∼

read-out, we made a second ﬁt limited to 2000 s. A result is shown Fig. 4. This numer-

ical analysis shows that our read-out system, connected to standard IPRT is compatible

with a temperature resolution of 25 µKef f over a 2000 s integration time. This value

appears to be rather higher than that what was expected from the theoretical white noise

level as introduced in Sec. 2-1 (8 µKef f ). This is due to the excess low frequency noise

below 1 Hz. We note that the ﬁnal estimation of noise is consistent with the value es-

timated in subsection 2.2.1 after measurements with a low TCR resistor. This shows

that the excess noise of the IPRT is likely not seen in this frequency range. Finally we

also note that for a short integration time (< 1s), the resolution obtained is close to the

theoretical one below 10 µK Hz−1/2. Such values (on short integration time) were also

obtained by Dupuis et al.14, but for 100 kΩ thermistors, the intrinsic voltage noise of

which were 31.6 times higher than the 100 Ω thermistor used in this study.

In order to reduce the temperature drifts during long time measurements, another exper-

imental setup at liquid-nitrogen temperature was built in association with a home-made

optimized PID controller which will be described in the next section.

3 LOW TEMPERATURE SAMPLE HOLDER AND

EXPERIMENTS

3.1 Sample holder design

The sample holder depicted in Fig. 5 was designed in order to improve long time tem-

perature measurements by introducing an optimized temperature control. It is known

7

that the temperature control of massive systems, even at temperature as low as 77 K,

can be made difﬁcult because of the inherent time delay between the heat production

(or heat removing) and the temperature rise (or temperature decrease) of the sample. It

follows that the overall gain of the servo loop cannot be made arbitrarily large in order

to ensure a sufﬁcient stability (Nyquist criterion). The present sample holder will serve

as the temperature controlled heat sink of a future active cavity radiometer (ACR). Its

mass must be much higher than the receiver one, say

103, as in the NIST (National

∼

Institute of Standards and Technology, USA) prototype, in order to act as a heat sink10.

We then chose a mass of 20 mg for the receiver and 20 g for the sample holder. In

order to minimize the heat travel between heating resistor and the thermometers glued

on the copper plate, the heating resistor, noted RH1 , was wound in a spiral grooved

at the rear of the plate. The resulting delay τD is 0.4 s. A second heating resistor,

noted RH2 , was wound, intertwined and identical to the ﬁrst one. It constitutes an easy

and reproducible way of applying an accurate heat perturbation to the system, either

in open loop or closed loop conﬁguration. The use of this auxillary input led to a very

convenient identiﬁcation of the parameters of the servo-loop models and greatly helped

the full characterization of the system. A large perturbation in the open loop conﬁgu-

ration was then applied in order to determine the thermal model parameters gathered

in Table 2. They are those of a ﬁrst order thermal circuit with a small delay. Using

these values and the signal characteristics of our read-out electronic system, we built

a SPICE model in order to derive a set of parameters for the PID controller feedback

circuit.

3.2 Full system characterization and performances

The schematic of the experimental arrangement used to fully characterize the tempera-

ture control of the sample holder is reported in Fig. 6. We used three high TCR resistors

made using a 200 nm thick high quality Y Ba2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) ﬁlm, patterned in
600 µm2 strips. Their R versus T characteristics and their derivatives are plotted

40

×

in Fig. 7. They exhibit the same critical temperature and very similar shapes. One of

8

these thermometers was used to sense the temperature in the servo loop, the two others

giving two independant observations of the temperature evolution of the copper plate.

Finally, a heat perturbation could be easily applied by means of the second heating

resistor RH2 . Data plotted in Fig. 8 show examples of this perturbation method with a

large signal applied on RH2 . Decreasing the voltage oscillation amplitude enables the

recording of small temperature oscillations in the two high sensitivity thermometers as

shown in Fig. 9. These recordings, performed in longer measuring times, were used

to calculate the noise spectra of our system. The frequency doubling in Fig. 8 is of

course associated with the squaring of the applied voltage producing the Joule heating

V 2/RH2 . From these data, it is easy to extract the rejection efﬁciency of the servo loop

at these frequencies for the heat perturbations coupled to the sample holder. We ﬁnd

a value of 400 at DC. This means that the stability of the sample holder temperature

is improved by

400 by closing the loop, and because the temperature drifts can be

70 µK s−1 in open loop, we are expecting a temperature stability of 0.175 µK s−1.

Moreover, the YBCO thermistors have a much higher sensitivity than the platinium

ones, as shown in Table 1, leading to a responsivity

42 mV K−1 at 0.83 mA

ℜi ∼

bias current. It follows that the temperature drifts occuring on the PC board will have a

relative effect

200 times lower than that obtained using an IPRT. Then, considering

the Johnson noise of the YBCO thermistors only, the ideal noise ﬂoor would be about

∼

∼

10 nKef f in a 1 Hz bandwidth. If the read-out electronics is not ideal, the noise ﬂoor

would be 30 nKef f . However, the overall performances are limited by the excess low

frequency noise of the YBCO thermistors, the level of which is generally dependent on

microstructural properties. Fig. 10 shows a recording at the output of two high sensi-

tivity thermometers during a measuring time of 400 s. They are clearly correlated, and

show a mean temperature drift of 87 nK s−1. This latter value is consistent with the ex-

pected one, because the temperature ﬂuctuations and drifts of the liquid-nitrogen bath

are likely associated with the ﬂuctuations and drifts of the atmospheric pressure with

a maximum rate of the order of 1 Pa s−1 on windy days and a conversion coefﬁcient

of 83 µK Pa−1 from Clapeyron’s law15. Finally, using the two simultaneous records

of Fig. 10, we also plotted the instantaneous difference between the two thermometers,

9

in order to get an estimation of the actual rms noise of the thermometers. We have

got a standard deviation σ = 2.8 µKef f during this integration time. This value is

much higher than the ideal one obtained using only the Johnson noise assumption. It

clearly indicates that the noise process in our YBCO samples, at the superconducting

transition, is dominated by excess low frequency ﬂuctuations of the resistance. The as-

sociated spectrum has been plotted in Fig. 11. Note that the calibration of this spectrum

was conveniently made using a reference signal at 5 mHz obtained with a known ap-

plied heat perturbation. Its amplitude was 95 mV, producing a temperature oscillation

of the sample holder of 30 µKpp in closed loop operation (see Fig. 9). However, despite

this large excess noise, we show in the following section that these performances are

still useful to design an ACR.

4 ESR PERSPECTIVES

The achieved low noise temperature control could be used to regulate the temperature

of the heat sink of the ESR. The NIST prototype described by Rice et al.10 will be con-

sidered below as an example. In order to estimate the performances, we will consider

the same conditions as those used in the NIST prototype. The ESR cavity is supposed

to receive radiant ﬂux ranging from the microwatt level to the milliwatt, coming from

an extended-source blackbody at T = 300 K. It was shown that the measurement could

be done with a contribution to the standard random uncertainty below 20 nW. As ex-

plained in Sec. 3.1, we reduced the mass of the heat sink, which implies the reduction

of that of the receiver down to 20 mg. This condition is thought to be very well fulﬁlled

using a plane membrane receiver and an integrating sphere above it. To derive our fol-

lowing noise calculations, we assume that the incident radiation Pin, to be converted in

electrical power PCR in order to keep the receiver at constant temperature, is chopped

at a frequency fo = 10 Hz. The simple electrothermal circuit we used to describe the

effects of thermometer noise on the receiver is reported in Fig. 12 where GESR and

CESR are the ESR thermal conductance and thermal capacitance, respectively. We in-

troduced the associated noise sources to three contributions having roughly the same

10

order of magnitude:

- Tn(f ), which is the spectral density of the temperature ﬂuctuations of the heat sink. It
is shown from 10−4 Hz to 10−1 Hz in Fig. 11 (b). Above 10−1 Hz the servo loop of the

heat sink is not suitable anymore, and we just extrapolated the quasi 1/f 2 T 2
dance. The spectral density Tn(f ) can be roughly ﬁtted by Tn(f ) = 8.10−7f −0,9 K Hz−1/2
from Fig. 11, we estimated its value at 10 Hz to be about 100 nK Hz−1/2.

n(f ) depen-

- Tn,ESR(f ), which is the spectral density of the YBCO thermometer attached to the

ESR. It would act as the error detector of the servo loop driving the ESR cavity. Be-

cause we intend to use the same material and detecting electronics as that of the heat

sink, we adopt the same spectral density Tn,ESR(f ) = Tn(f ),which should hold up to

about 100 Hz, before joining the Johnson level. As a matter of fact, recordings of the

thermometer output, using a wide opening (300 Hz) of the lock-in ampliﬁer unit, led

to this spectral density.

- Tn,A(f ), which is the equivalent noise associated with the ampliﬁer. At 10 Hz, a
1 nV Hz−1/2 of the

reasonable value is given by the ratio of the voltage noise enA ≃
ampliﬁer to the thermometer responsitivity

42 mV K−1 at 0.83 mA bias.

ℜi ≃

Furthermore, in the circuit of Fig. 12, S represents the thermometer sensitivity includ-

ing gain (in V K−1). We assume S = 100 V K−1 and AOP is an operational ampliﬁer,

closing the servo loop and feeding the heating resistor RH of the ESR cavity. As-

suming the AOP ideal, the inversing operational ampliﬁer input writes V− = VREF ,

implying the thermometer circuit input to be VREF /S. Standard circuit analysis leads

to:

TESR(f ) =

Tn(f )GESR + Pin + PCR
GESR + jCESRω

(1)

where the heat ﬂow between the thermometer and the ESR body is neglected. Finally,

The “Kirchhoff” law gives:

11

TESR(f ) + Tn,ESR(f ) + Tn,A(f ) =

VREF
S

The deduced feedback power is written in two parts:

PCR + Pin = (GESR + jCESRω)

VREF
S

is the ideal part, if we consider that there is no noise, and:

(2)

(3)

PCR,n =

GESR[(Tn,ESR(f ) + Tn,A(f ))(1 + jτESRω) + Tn(f )]

(4)

−

is the noisy feedback power.

In the bandwidth of the ESR any change in Pin will induce a change in PCR in order

to keep the receiver temperature constant and PCR accounts for the output signal. The

second part accounts for the noise on the feedback power, the minus sign indicating

that this part of the feedback power reacts so as to balance the various noise sources.

Eq. 4 is deduced from a small signal analysis applied to Eq. 2, i.e. by nulling its right

member, and to Eq. 1, i.e. with Pin = 0. Assuming the noise sources to be uncorrelated

we get the ﬁnal spectral noise density of PCR,n:

= GESR × s

T 2
n(f ) +

n,A(f ) + T 2
T 2
1 + jτ 2

ESRω2

n,ESR(f )

(5)

We may now use the values attached to the noise sources to estimate whether or not

we fulﬁll the ESR requirements. For clarity, we examine independently the effects of
n(f ) and T 2
T 2

n,A(f ). The numerical values are calculated at a chopping

n,ESR(f ) + T 2

frequency of 10 Hz, assuming a measuring time of 250 s with a ﬁrst order post ﬁlter-

ing. Before performing these calculations we need to know the numerical value of the

12

thermal conductance GESR. The latter is related to the dynamic range of the ESR,

i.e., the largest input signal Pin,Max that can be measured. In the chopped mode of

the incoming power Pin, the feedback power will oscillate between the on-off states of

Pin, leading to the condition of Eq. 6 to be fulﬁlled by GESR:

GESR =

S

×

Pin,MAX
VREF

(6)

Choosing Pin,MAX = 10 mW, VREF = 10 V, S = 100 V K−1 gives GESR =
100 mW K−1. Such a thermal conductance value can reasonably be achieved at 90 K

using silicon micromachining techniques16,17: for calculations we assumed a 10

30 µm thick membrane of 3

−
3 mm2 area. It follows that the noise associated with
Tn(10 Hz) of the order of 10−8 W Hz−1/2,

×

that of the heat sink should be GESR ×
i.e., a standard deviation of the order 800 pWef f with a measuring time of 250 s. To

estimate the noise associated with that of the receiver thermometer we need to know

the receiver time constant. Because of the small active volume of the receiver and of

the high thermal conductance value, the thermal time constant would be much shorter

than that of the NIST prototype, about 0.1 ms at 90 K. We then deduce the order

of magnitude of the associated noise to be close to GESR ×
≃
1.6 nW Hz−1/2, which means an rms value of 130 pWef f for 250 s observing time.

Tn,ESR(10Hz)/2π

We then conclude that these estimated values, although estimated using a rough model,

are very promising, within an order of magnitude below the demonstrated values by

Rice et al.10. Similar results were presented by Libonate and Foukal18, reporting a

root-mean-square noise level of 1.6 nW and a 30 s time measurement for an allowable

input-power level of up to

2 mW. These experimental results are of the same order

∼

of magnitude as ours, calculated for an input-power level of up to 10 mW. No speciﬁc

optimization in order to reduce the excess noise in our YBCO ﬁlms was made, which

explains why the noise level is rather large, if compared to other works17,19. As shown

by Neff et al.17, the use of a thin gold layer onto the YBCO layer can lead to very

low noise equivalent temperature at 10 Hz. The use of such levels in our model would

13

have lead to dramatic reduction of the noise ﬂoor of the sample holder, which means

improvements in the ESR performances. We would like to point out that the use of a

small membrane and an integrating sphere does not allow a proper primary radiometer

operation, but the very short time constant would permit the use of a much higher

shopping frequency. This means working conditions in the white noise domain of

the YBCO sensors, implying a possible reduction of two orders of magnitude of the

noise ﬂoor level, which appear still very attractive. Such a system would then have

performances close to the liquid-helium-cooled ESR of Reintsema et al.20. Finally, to

eliminate the problem of the integrating sphere, we have done preliminary calculations

in order to design a 1 cm aperture, 1.5 cm long pyramidal cavity in silicon, with wall

thicknesses ranging between 5 to 50 µm. A high conductance value of

100 mW K−1

∼

is feasible together with a time constant of the order of 0.1 s. Such a system would

then be very attractive because it could include full-integrated heating resistors and

thermometers. Thus correlation techniques and a perturbation heating method could

be used as well to improve model identiﬁcation and signal processing.

FIG. 1. Read-out electronic system: a square wave voltage is applied to two voltage

dividers, one includes the thermistor Rth, the other includes a low TCR resistance. A

true differential ampliﬁer (SSM2017) followed by a lock-in ampliﬁer and a Butterworth

ﬁlter (2nd-order) shapes the useful output signal of the battery-operated power system.

FIG. 2. Simultaneous temperature evolution of two read-out electronic systems (curves

b and c), each using an IPRT sensor as thermistor: the slow temperature drift enables

the evaluation of the responsivity

. A reference IPRT thermometer (curve a) is used

to calibrate the temperature deviation.

ℜ

FIG. 3. Temperature measurements after the substraction of the main temperature drift,

showing the correlation between the three thermometer responses: read-out electronic

systems, each using an IPRT as thermistor (symbols), and a smoothing ﬁt of reference

IPRT thermometer (line)

FIG. 4. Fluctuation temperature during 2000 s after a linear ﬁt, measured with two

read-out electronic systems each using an IPRT as thermistor. A standard deviation σ

of 25 µK is demonstrated (for system II). A 100 µK maximal temperature difference is

observed between the two thermometer read-outs.

FIG. 5. The liquid-nitrogen temperature measurement setup: a reference IPRT ther-

mometer and YBCO thin ﬁlm thermometers are glued on the copper sample holder.

Two heating resistors RH1,2 = 30 Ω were made using constantan wires and distributed

evenly across the sample holder cross-section.

FIG. 6. Schematic of the home-made PID controller: the three boxes named P, I and

D depict the functions proportional, integral and derivative, respectively. The temper-

ature measurements were made with three read-out electronic systems, each using an

YBCO thermometer: one was used for regulation purpose (thermistor C) and two for

correlation investigations (thermistors A and B). Two heating resistors RH1,2 = 30 Ω

were made using constantan wire.

FIG. 7. Resistances R (closed symbols) and their derivative dR/dT (opened symbols)

as a function of temperature T for three high resolution YBCO thermometers at 1 mA

bias.

FIG. 8. A sine wave voltage, called perturbation heating, is applied to the heating re-

sistor RH1 (curve a). The PID output reacts as shown in curve b (note the frequency

doubling). The resulting temperature deviation is measured by the two read-out elec-

tronic systems, each using an YBCO thermometer (curves c and d, right axis), which

show very similar responses.

FIG. 9. Thermometric responses of the read-out electronic systems associated with

a low temperature oscillation provided by a 5 mHz perturbation heating (

95 mV

∼

amplitude) applied to the sample holder.

FIG. 10. Temperature measurement without perturbation signals using two read-out

electronic systems, each using an YBCO thermometer : the two temperature deviation

are plotted (left axis). The instantaneous difference (right axis) gives an estimation

of the actual rms noise of the thermometers. For a 400 s measurement, a standard

deviation equivalent of 2.8 µKef f is obtained.

FIG. 11. Input spectral noise density en and noise equivalent temperature (NET) Tn

for a read-out electronic system without thermistor (curve c) and with an YBCO ﬁlm

(curve b) as well as the theoretical white noise value (curve d) are plotted. The NET

of the reference IPRT thermometer is reported for comparison (curve a on right axis

only).

FIG. 12. Simple electrothermal circuit used to describe the effects of thermometer

noise on the receiver: GESR et CESR are the ESR thermal conductance and thermal

capacitance, respectively, Pin and PCR are the incident radiation and the electrical

power, respectively. Tn(f ) is the spectral density of the temperature ﬂuctuations of the

heat sink. Tn,ESR(f ) is the spectral density of the YBCO thermometer attached to the

ESR. Tn,A(f ) is the noise equivalent temperature associated with the ampliﬁer.

Abstract

A vertex detector concept of the Linear Collider Flavour Iden-
tiﬁcation (LCFI) collaboration, which studies pixel detectors
for heavy quark ﬂavour identiﬁcation, has been implemented
in simulations for c-quark tagging in scalar top studies. The
production and decay of scalar top quarks (stops) is particu-
larly interesting for the development of the vertex detector as
only two c-quarks and missing energy (from undetected neu-
tralinos) are produced for light stops. Previous studies inves-
tigated the vertex detector design in scenarios with large mass
differences between stop and neutralino, corresponding to large
visible energy in the detector. In this study we investigate the
tagging performance dependence on the vertex detector design
in a scenario with small visible energy for the International Lin-
ear Collider (ILC).

Abstract. A vertex detector concept of the Linear Collider Flavour Identiﬁcation (LCFI) collabo-
ration, which studies pixel detectors for heavy quark ﬂavour identiﬁcation, has been implemented in
simulations for c-quark tagging in scalar top studies. The production and decay of scalar top quarks
(stops) is particularly interesting for the development of the vertex detector as only two c-quarks and
missing energy (from undetected neutralinos) are produced for light stops. Previous studies investi-
gated the vertex detector design in scenarios with large mass differences between stop and neutralino,
corresponding to large visible energy in the detector. In this study we investigate the tagging per-
formance dependence on the vertex detector design in a scenario with small visible energy for the
International Linear Collider (ILC).

1. Introduction

The development of a vertex detector for a Linear Collider is an important and challeng-
ing enterprise. A key aspect is the distance of the innermost layer to the interaction point,
which is related to radiation hardness and beam background. Another key aspect is the
number of radiation lengths the particles go through, since it determines the multiple scat-
tering which affects the vertex reconstruction.

The optimization of the vertex detector tagging performance is of great importance for
studies of physics processes. While mostly at previous and current accelerators (e.g. SLC,
LEP, Tevatron) b-quark tagging has revolutionized many searches and measurements, c-
quark tagging will be very important at a future Linear Collider, for example, in studies
of Supersymmetric dark matter [1]. Therefore, c-quark tagging could be a benchmark
for vertex detector developments. The scalar top production and decay process, and the
implemented vertex detector geometry are shown before [2].

The analysis for a large mass difference with the SPS-5 parameter point (ISAJET) m˜t1 =
= 120.0 GeV and cos θ˜t = 0.5377 was previously performed [3]. For
220.7 GeV, m ˜χ0
25% (12%) efﬁciency 3800 (1800) signal events and 5400 (170) background events without
c-quark tagging were obtained, while the background was reduced to 2300 (68) events with
c-quark tagging.

The vertex detector radiation length was varied between single thickness (TESLA TDR)
and double thickness. In addition, the number of vertex detector layers was varied between
5 layers (innermost layer at 1.5 cm as in the TESLA TDR) and 4 layers (innermost layer
at 2.6 cm). For SPS-5 parameters the following numbers of background events remain [3]:

A signiﬁcant larger number of background events was expected if the ﬁrst layer of the
vertex detector is removed. The distance of the ﬁrst layer to the interaction point is also an
important aspect from the accelerator physics (beam delivery) perspective. The interplay
between the beam delivery and vertex detector design in regard to critical tolerances like
hardware damage of the ﬁrst layer and occupancy (unable to use the data of the ﬁrst layer)
due to beam background goes beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in the
future.

For large visible energy (large mass difference) no signiﬁcant increase in the expected
background was observed for doubling the thickness of the vertex detector layers [3,4]. In
this study the effect of the vertex detector design for events with smaller visible energy in
the detector is addressed.

2. Signal and Background Simulations

The production of simulated light stops at a 500 GeV Linear Collider is analyzed using
−1. The signature for stop pair production at an e+e− collider
high luminosity L = 500 fb
is two charm jets and large missing energy:

− → ˜t1

¯˜t1 → c ˜χ0

For small ∆m = m˜t1 − m ˜χ0
, the jets are relatively soft and separation from backgrounds
is very challenging. Backgrounds arising from various Standard Model processes can have
cross-sections that are several orders of magnitude larger than the signal. Thus, it is neces-
sary to study this process with a realistic detector simulation. Signal and background events
are generated with PYTHIA 6.129 [5], including a scalar top signal generation [6] previ-
ously used in Ref. [7]. The detector simulation is based on the fast simulation SIMDET [8],
describing a typical ILC detector. Good agreement in comparisons with SGV [9] detector
simulations was obtained [3,4].

Cross-sections for the signal process and the relevant backgrounds have been computed
with code used in Ref. [10] and by GRACE 2.0 [11], with cross-checks to COMPHEP
4.4 [12]. A minimal transverse momentum cut, pt > 5 GeV, is applied for the two-photon
background, to avoid the infrared divergence. Details of the event selection are given in
Ref. [1].

The c-tagging with the LCFI detector is based on the vertex identiﬁcation and a neural
network application [13]. The vertex identiﬁcation considered three cases for each jet
independently:

a) only a primary vertex. In this case, the two tracks with the largest separation in the r-
φ plane are considered and for these tracks the neural network variables include, the
impact parameter and its signiﬁcance (impact parameter divided by uncertainty) both
in the r-φ plane and in the z-direction, their momenta, and the joined probability in
r-φ plane and z direction.

b) one secondary vertex. In addition to the previous variables, the decay length signiﬁ-
cance of the secondary vertex, the multiplicity and momenta of all associated tracks,
and the Pt corrected mass of the secondary vertex (corrected for neutral hadrons and
neutrinos), the Pt of the decay products perpendicular to the ﬂight direction between
primary and secondary vertex, and the joint probability in r-φ and z-direction.

c) more than one secondary vertex. Two secondary vertices are considered, where the
tracks are assigned to the vertex closest to the primary vertex, and the neural network
input variables are deﬁned as in case b).

The neural network is tuned with 255,000 simulated signal and 240,000 Weν background
events. The signal events are a combination of all simulated signal events for the scalar top
mass range between 120 to 220 GeV and for ∆m = 5, 10 and 15 GeV.

After a preselection which substantially reduces the background while keeping about
70% of the signal, six sequential cuts are applied: number of jets, missing energy,
acollinearity, thrust angle, transverse momentum, and the jet-jet invariant mass and c-
tagging [1]. The background consists of the following processes W+W−, ZZ, Weν, eeZ,
q¯q( q 6= t), t¯t, and two-photon. After all cuts, the total background of about 5680 events is
dominated by about 5044 Weν events [1]. A scalar top signal of 120 GeV has been simu-
lated with a neutralino mass of 110 GeV. The selection efﬁciency is about 20%1 and 11,500
signal events are expected for a standard LCFI vertex detector conﬁguration as given in the
TESLA TDR.

3. Varying the Vertex Detector Design

This study of the vertex detector design is based on 50,000 simulated 120 GeV signal
and 210,000 Weν background events for each detector design. After preselection 29,842
signal and 53,314 Weν events are selected, corresponding to 34,318 and 779,450 events
per 500 fb−1, respectively. This preselection signal efﬁciency of 59.7% does not depend
on the vertex detector design. Four detector designs are compared:

VX12: the TESLA TDR design with 5 layers and single (0.064% X0 radiation length per

layer).

VX22: 4 layers (the innermost layer removed). This scenario could for example occur if the
vertex detector is exposed to a large dose of machine background from the acceler-
ator. The optimization of the radius of the innermost layer is an important aspect in
the design of a vertex detector for a Linear Collider.

VX32: 5 layers and double material thickness (0.128% X0 radiation length per layer). As
the rigidity of the sensitive elements and the support structure is another important
aspect in the detector design, the material budget has to be taken into account.

VX42: 4 layers (the innermost layer removed) and double thickness (0.128% X0 radiation

length per layer).

The c-tagging efﬁciency per event is normalized to the number of signal events after the
preselection and requiring two jets. At least one c-tagged jet is required and the efﬁciency
is given in Fig. 1 as a function of the purity, where purity is deﬁned as the ratio of the

1The retuning of the c-tagging neural network increased the selection efﬁciency from 19% [1] to
20% and the Weν background from 5044 [1] to 5322 ± 280 events.

number of simulated signal events after the c-tagging to all c-tagged events assuming the
same luminosity for signal and background. The different purities are obtained by varying
the cut on the c-tagging neural network variable. The effect of the detector design variation
increases with increasing purity (harder c-tagging neural network cut). For the second set
of points in the plot with purities about 18% and c-tagging efﬁciencies between 85% and
90%, the variation of the signal efﬁciency and the number of Weν background events is
given in the table after all selection cuts.

Purity

Figure 1. Left: scalar top c-tagging efﬁciency and purity with Weν background for
different detector designs. The VX12 curve is for a detector design with 5 layers (in-
nermost at 15 mm) and single density, curve VX22 is for a detector design with 4 layers
(innermost at 26 mm). Curves VX32 and VX42 are for double density (0.128% X0
radiation length per layer) with 4 and 5 layers, respectively. Right: expected signal
efﬁciency and number of Weν background events for the four detector designs. The
statistical uncertainties are also given.

These results for small visible energy (∆m = 10 GeV) lead to the same observation as for
large visible energy (SPS-5 scenario with ∆m = 100.7 GeV). The radius of the innermost
layer of the vertex detector has a large effect on the c-quark tagging performance. Curves
VX12 and VX22 of Fig. 1 show the performance for radii 15 and 26 mm, respectively.
There is no signiﬁcant effect on the c-quark tagging performance from doubling the ma-
terial budget (e.g. curves VX12 and VX32 of Fig. 1). The increase of multiple scattering
is not signiﬁcant between single and double thickness (0.128% X0 radiation length per
layer).

In order to quantitatively estimate the multiple scattering effect, the number of tracks per
signal event and the visible energy have been determined. The minimum visible energy per

Linear Collider Workshop

event is about 10 GeV and the maximum number of tracks is about 20, therefore the min-
imum track energy is about 0.5 GeV. The analytical calculation of the multiple scattering
angle is given by θ ≈ 13.6/P · px/X0, where the track momentum P is given in MeV.
The displacement at the interaction point is d ≈ Rθ, where R is the radius of the inner-
most layer of the vertex detector. For P = 500 MeV, x/X0 = 0.128% and R = 15 mm,
d = 15µm. This small value compared to the ﬂight distance of charm mesons explains
the insigniﬁcant effect on the c-quark tagging from the multiple scattering increase by
doubling the vertex detector layer thickness.

5. Conclusions

In conclusion, the studies with a small visible energy signal lead to the same results as in
the previous study for large visible energy regarding the vertex detector design. A strong
dependence on the detector performance on the radius of the innermost vertex detector
layer has been observed, while doubling the material thickness has no signiﬁcant effect on
the c-quark tagging performance in scalar top studies at the ILC. The optimization of the
radius of the innermost vertex detector layer will have to take into account the accelerator
background which depends on the machine optics and the collimation system.

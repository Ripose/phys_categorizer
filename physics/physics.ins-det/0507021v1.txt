Glass RPC detectors are an attractive candidate for the active part of a highly granular digital
hadron calorimeter (DHCAL) at the ILC. A numerical study, based on the GEANT3 simulation
package, of the performance of such a calorimeter is presented in this work. A simpliﬁed model for the
RPC response, tuned on real data, is implemented in the simulation. The reliability of the simulation
is demonstrated by comparison to existing data collected with a large volume calorimeter prototype
exposed to a pion beam in an energy range from 2 GeV to 10 GeV. In view of an optimization of
the readout pitch, a detailed study of the energy and position resolution at the single hadron level
for diﬀerent read-out pad dimensions is presented. These results are then used in a parametric form
to obtain a preliminary estimate of the contribution of DHCAL to the reconstruction of the energy
ﬂow at the ILC detector.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Common wisdom, based both on experimental results from LEP and from simulation for higher energy e+e−
interactions, leads to believe that the “energy ﬂow” technique might provide the best possible resolution on jet
energy, jet direction and jet invariant mass. This technique requires building very segmented calorimeters both
longitudinally and transversely and leads naturally to the use of gas detectors, at least in the hadronic part. Digital
(track counting) calorimetry in this framework seems to be the logical choice and is one of the options proposed for
the ILC detector. Out of the possible active detectors one could use to implement digital calorimetry are parallel
plate detectors, thanks to the easy of construction, the lack of privileged directions (in contrast to wire chambers),
the possibility to shape them almost at will and the possibility to cover large surfaces at low cost.

An R&D programme (CaPiRe experiment) was launched in 2003 aimed at the design and characterization of RPC
detectors based on glass electrodes for this application. Preliminary results, showing that glass RPCs can stand the
ﬂux of particles expected in the hadron calorimeter at the ILC, have been reported elsewhere [2]. This is instead
a report of a numerical study of the performance of a Digital Hadron Calorimeter (DHCAL) using glass RPCs as
active detectors. After a discussion of the basic features of the calorimeter implemented in our simulation and of
a comparison to existing data (Section II), a detailed study of the energy resolution at the single hadron level for
diﬀerent read-out conﬁguration is addressed (Section III. Finally (Section IV) an estimate of the contribution of
DHCAL to the reconstruction of the energy ﬂow at the ILC detector is performed.

II. DHCAL SIMULATION: MODEL PARAMETERS AND VALIDATION

A standalone simulation of a detector similar in geometry to the hadron calorimeter proposed for the TESLA
detector [1] has been implemented with the GEANT3 package [3], which performs particle tracking and interactions
in the detector media. The GEISHA model is used for hadron cascades. Our DHCAL model consists of 39 stainless
steel layers 2 cm thick, interleaved by 38 planes of sensitive elements. The transverse dimensions of the detector are
of little relevance in this study.

Track counting is performed by Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) with glass electrodes. They are assumed to be
housed in a 20 mm gap between the stainless steel planes and are described with coarse detail in the simulation: the

text.

active element is a 2 mm gas-ﬁlled gap; all the other elements (the 2 mm thick glass electrodes, the readout plane
and the empty gaps) are modelled as a continuous medium of 1 g/cm2 average density. An approximate description
of the digitization process has been implemented, based on our present knowledge of the RPC behaviour. The active
part of each RPC is segmented in 2 mm × 2 mm elementary cells, matching the typical transverse dimensions of a
spark in streamer mode. Digital signals are induced on readout pads if at least one of the elementary cells subtended
by it ﬁres. This is assumed to happen with 95% eﬃciency when an ionizing particle crosses an elementary cell. No
induction from cells farther apart from the pad is included. As discussed hereafter, the transverse pad dimensions
have been varied from 1 × 1 cm2 to 10 × 10 cm2.

The reliability of this simulation of the DHCAL response to hadrons depends on the description of hadron in-
teractions and on the assumption made in the description of the digitization at the readout stage. This has been
studied by comparing our simulation to existing data collected with a small prototype of the MONOLITH experi-
ment exposed to a pion beam of energy from 2 GeV to 10 GeV [4]. The prototype consisted in 20 iron planes 5 cm
thick, instrumented with glass RPC readout by 1 cm readout strips on one side of the chambers. A part form these
diﬀerences in the detector layout, accounted for in the simulation, the simulation is run under the same assumptions
adopted in the DHCAL description: a digital readout of the ﬁred strips is considered, without induction on adjacent
strips. This is a rude approximation, as, for this read-out pitch, an average hit multiplicity of about 1.4 hits/plane
has been observed with isolated tracks. To account for this in the comparison to the MONOLITH prototype data a
1.4 scale factor on the hit multiplicity predicted by the simulation is introduced.

As shown in ﬁgure 1, a fair agreement between our simulation and real data is observed, once data are corrected
for a residual noise of about two strips ﬁred at null pion energy. At variance with real data our simulation seems
to show the onset of saturation around 8-10 GeV (ﬁgure 1 left). Yet, the description of the data in terms of energy
resolution is adequate for the purposes of this study and validates our simulation model in the energy range most
relevant for hadron calorimetry at the ILC, where the spectrum of neutral hadrons is expected to peak at low energy
with an average energy of around 10 GeV.

SINGLE HADRON ENERGY RESOLUTION

A full characterization of the response to single hadrons of DHCAL with glass RPC detectors in terms of linearity
and energy resolutions has been performed for several diﬀerent read-out pitch conﬁgurations. Our results for single
pions of energy ranging from 2 GeV to 40 GeV and impinging on the calorimeter at normal incidence are summarized

in ﬁgure 2. The response of the baseline analog calorimeter proposed in the TESLA TDR [1], based on plastic
scintillators as active medium, is also shown for comparison.

As expected deviations from linearity grow more important with increasing pad dimensions. The resolution corre-
spondingly worsens and the onset of saturation appears at lower energies for larger pad sizes. Yet, the behaviour is
satisfactory in the most relevant energy region for neutral hadrons at the ILC, at least up to 2 cm times 2 cm pad
sizes. In this region, DHCAL also presents an energy resolution better than the expected performance of the baseline
analog calorimeter proposed the TESLA detector [1] (see ﬁgure 2-right). For 1 × 1 cm2 pads, the resolution can
be parameterized with a stochastic term of 55%/pE(GeV) and a constant term of about 10%. For the option with
2 × 2 cm2 pads, the constant term is about 16%. These results agree with the one presented in an earlier study [5].

ENERGY FLOW

A complete understanding of the performance of a RPC based DHCAL calorimeter and of its contribution to
the energy ﬂow reconstructions requires the development of a full simulation and event reconstruction in a complex
detector, including the tracking device and the electromagnetic calorimeter. This is beyond the aim of this preliminary
work. Some indications of the DHCAL contribution to the resolution of the energy ﬂow algorithm can however be
deduced already with a parametric approach. To this end, the energy ﬂow resolution is parameterized as:

E.F = σ2
σ2

c.p. + σ2

e.m. + σ2

n.h. + σ2

conf usion,

where the ﬁrst three terms describe the energy resolution of the detector to charged particles, photons and neutral
hadrons respectively and the last term accounts for the ﬁnite capability of a real detector to fully disentangle the
energy deposition in the calorimeters due to charged tracks, because of shower overlaps. W W and ZZ are generated
with the PYTHIA 6.205 code [6] and the energy and momenta of the individual particles have been smeared according
to the expected resolution on their measurement:

• The energy of the photons has been smeared according to the expected resolution of the ECAL calorimeter

(σe.m./Ee.m. = 15%/pE(GeV)),

• The energy of neutral hadrons has been smeared according to the results of the DHCAL simulation for single

hadrons discussed above, including the angular dependence,

• The energy of charged particles has been assumed to be perfectly reconstructed by the magnetic spectrometer.

Events are then clustered in jets and the energy of the jets compared to the one of the original parton. This “perfect
energy ﬂow” algorithm, unrealistic indeed, shows a resolution of about 16%/pE(GeV). A more realistic energy ﬂow
measurement has been simulated by adding an additional smearing to the jet energy resolution of 25%/pE(GeV)
as expected for particle confusion in a real detector. This last term was estimated in [7] for a detector conﬁguration
with a granularity of 5 cm × 5 cm in the hadron calorimeter and may be somewhat overestimated in our case.

Our results are shown in ﬁgure 3: a resolution of about 30%/pE(GeV) is observed, dominated by the contribution
of σconf usion. Within the approximations discussed, little diﬀerence is observed between 1 × 1 cm2 and 2 × 2 cm2
granularities. indicating that the latter granularity already matches the desired performance to accomplish the ILC
physics programme.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

Glass RPC detectors are attractive candidates as active detectors of the Digital Hadron Calorimeter at the ILC.
A standalone simulation of the DHCAL response with RPC response has been developed and validated on existing
data. A fast (parametric) simulation shows that the DHCAL with RPC detectors with read-out granularities of
about 2 × 2 cm2 matches the target performance for the ILC physics. Further studies aimed at the optimization of
the detector geometry should address the full simulation within the ILC detector and the contribution of the highly
granular DHCAL to the muon identiﬁcation.

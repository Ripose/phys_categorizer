Abstract

The utilisation of crystalline semiconductor materials as detectors and devices op-
erating in high radiation environments, at the future particle colliders, in space
applications, in medicine and industry, makes necessary to obtain radiation harder
materials. Diamond, SiC and diﬀerent AIII BV compounds (GaAs, GaP, InP, InAs,
InSb) are possible competitors for silicon to diﬀerent electronic devices for the up-
mentioned applications. The main goal of this paper is to give theoretical predictions
about the behaviour of these semiconductors in hadron ﬁelds (pions, protons). The
eﬀects of the interaction between the incident particle and the semiconductor are
characterised in the present paper both from the point of view of the projectile, the
relevant quantity being the energy loss by nuclear interactions, and of the target,
using the concentration of primary radiation induced defects on unit particle ﬂu-
ence. Some predictions about the damage induced by hadrons in these materials in
possible applications in particle physics and space experiments are done.

The crystalline materials for semiconductor devices used in high ﬂuences of
particles are strongly aﬀected by the eﬀects of radiation. After the interaction

between the incoming particle and the target, mainly two classes of degrada-
tion eﬀects are observed: surface and bulk material damage, the last due to the
displacement of atoms from their sites in the lattice. After lepton irradiation,
the eﬀects are dominantly at the surface, while heavy particles (hadrons and
ions) produce both types of damages.

Up to now, in spite of the experimental and theoretical eﬀorts, the under-
standing of the behaviour of semiconductor materials in radiation ﬁelds, the
identiﬁcation of the induced defects and their characterisation, as well as the
explanation of the degradation mechanisms are still open problems.

The utilisation of semiconductor materials as detectors and devices operating
in high radiation environments, at the future particle colliders, in space appli-
cations, in medicine and industry, makes necessary to obtain radiation harder
materials.

Diamond, SiC and diﬀerent AIIIBV compounds (GaAs, GaP, InP, InAs, InSb)
are in principle, possible competitors for silicon in the realisation of diﬀerent
electronic devices.

All analysed materials have a zinc-blend crystalline structure, with the excep-
tion of SiC, that presents the property of polytypism [1]. The polytypism refers
to one-dimensional polymorphism, i.e. the existence of diﬀerent stackings of
the basic structural elements along one direction. More than 200 polytypes
have been reported in literature [2], but only few of them have practical im-
portance. These include the cubic form 3C(β), and the 4H and 6H hexagonal
forms. For the cubic polytype, the symmetry group is T 2
d , while for the hexag-
onal ones this is C 4
6v. Silicon is at the base of electronic industry, diamond
and the AIIIBV compounds present attractive electrical and/or luminescence
properties, of interest for diﬀerent applications, while the utilisation of SiC
as a radiation detector, both in high energy physics and in the ﬁeld of X-ray
astronomy is now under extensive investigation more conferences in the ﬁeld
having sections dedicated to SiC.

The diamond has the reputation of being a radiation hard material and it
is considered as a good competitor to silicon, but non all its properties as a
radiation hard material have been proved experimentally.

The main goal of this paper is to give some theoretical predictions about the
behaviour of diﬀerent semiconductors in hadron ﬁelds (pions, protons), these
materials representing potential candidates for detectors and electronic devices
working in hostile environments.

The treatment of the interaction between the incident particle and the solid
can be performed from the point of view of the projectile or of the target.
In the ﬁrst case, the relevant quantity is the energy loss (or equivalently the

2

stopping power) and in the second situation the eﬀects of the interactions are
described by diﬀerent physical quantities characterising material degradation.
There is no a physical quantity dedicated to the global characterisation of
the eﬀects of radiation in the semiconductor material. A possible choice is the
concentration of primary radiation induced defects on the unit particle ﬂuence
(CPD), introduced by [3]. It permits the correlation of damages produced in
diﬀerent materials at the same kinetic energy of the incident hadron. For
the comparison of the eﬀects of diﬀerent particles in the same semiconductor
material, the non ionising energy loss (NIEL) is useful.

As a measure of the degradation to radiation, in the present paper the energy
lost by the incident particle in the nuclear interaction and the concentration
of primary defects induced in semiconductor bulk are calculated. If the energy
loss of the incident projectile is, in principle, a measurable physical quantity,
the concentration of primary defects is not directly observable and measurable
and can be put in evidence only indirectly, e.g. from the variation of macro-
scopical parameters of the material or/and of electronic devices. It is to be
noted that there exists also a kinetics of the defects induced by irradiation
giving rise to the annealing process. A general treatment of the evolution pro-
cesses is not possible, so, only some particular models exist in literature, see
for example [4] and the references cited therein in the case of silicon. In these
circumstances, in the present paper only the primary process of defect genera-
tion is modelled .This way, the energy range of incident hadrons for which the
concentration of primary defects do not aﬀect irreversibly the device properties
could be established (theoretically predicted).

2 Model of the degradation

2.1 Energy loss

At the passage of the incident charged particle in the semiconductor material
same of its energy is deposited into the target. The charged particles interact
with both atomic and electronic systems in a solid. The total rate of energy
loss, could, in general, be divided artiﬁcially into two components, the nuclear
and the electronic part.

The energy lost due to interactions with the electrons of the target gives rise
to material ionisation, while the energy lost in interactions with nuclei is at
the origin of defect creation.

A comprehensive theoretical treatment of electronic stopping, which covers all
energies of interest, cannot be formulated simply because of diﬀerent approxi-

3

mations concerning both the scattering and contribution of diﬀerent electrons
in the solid. For fast particles with velocities higher then the orbital velocities
of electrons, the Bethe-Bloch formula is to be used [5]. At lower velocities,
inner electrons have velocities greater than particle velocity, and therefore do
not contribute to the energy loss. This regime has been modelled for the gen-
eral case by Lindhard and Scharﬀ[6] and particular cases have been treated,
e.g. in reference [7]. If the particle has a positive charge, and a velocity close to
the orbital velocity of its outer electrons, it has a high probability of capturing
an electron from one of the atoms of the medium through which it passes. This
process contributes to the total inelastic energy loss since the moving ion has
to expend energy in the removal of the electrons which it captures.

The nuclear stopping depends on the detailed nature of the atomic scattering,
and this in turn depends intimately on the form of the interaction potential. At
low energies, a realistic potential based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation
has been used in the literature [6] and at higher energies, where scattering
results from the interaction of unscreened nuclei, a Rutherford collision model
is to be used.

2.2 Bulk defect production

The mechanism considered in the study of the interaction between the incom-
ing particle and the solid, by which bulk defects are produced, is the following:
the particle, heavier than the electron, with electrical charge or not, interacts
with the electrons and with the nuclei of the crystalline lattice. The nuclear
interaction produces bulk defects. As a result of the interaction, depending on
the energy and on the nature of the incident particle, one or more light par-
ticles are produced, and usually one or more heavy recoil nuclei. These nuclei
have charge and mass numbers lower or at least equal to those of the medium.
After the interaction process, the recoil nucleus or nuclei, if they have suﬃ-
cient energy, are displaced from the lattice positions into interstitials. Then,
the primary knock-on nucleus, if its energy is large enough, can produce the
displacement of a new nucleus, and the process could continue as a cascade,
until the energy of the nucleus becomes lower than the threshold for atomic
displacements.

The concentration of the primary radiation induced defects on unit ﬂuence
has been calculated starting from the following equation:

CP D (E) =

1

2Ed Z Xi

dσi
dΩ

L (ERi) dΩ

(1)

where E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle, Ed the threshold energy

4

for displacements in the lattice, ERi the recoil energy of the residual nucleus,
L (ERi) the Lindhard factor describing the partition between ionisation and
displacements and dσi/dΩ the diﬀerential cross section for the process respon-
sible in defect production. In the concrete calculations, all nuclear processes,
and all mechanisms inside each process are included in the summation over in-
dex i. Because of the regular nature of the crystalline lattice, the displacement
energy is anisotropic.

In the concrete evaluation of defect production, the nuclear interactions must
be modelled, see for example references [3,8–10]. The primary interaction be-
tween the hadron and the nucleus of the lattice presents characteristics re-
ﬂecting the peculiarities of the hadron, especially at relatively low energies.
If the inelastic process is initiated by nucleons, the identity of the incoming
projectile is lost, and the creation of secondary particles is associated with
energy exchanges which are of the order of MeV or larger. For pion nucleus
processes, the absorption, the process by which the pion disappears as a real
particle, is also possible.

The energy dependence of cross sections, for proton and pion interaction with
the nucleus, presents very diﬀerent behaviours: the proton-nucleus cross sec-
tions decrease with the increase of the projectile energy, then have a minimum
at relatively low energies, followed by a smooth increase, while the pion nu-
cleus cross sections present for all processes a large maximum, at about 160
MeV, reﬂecting the resonant structure of interaction (the ∆33 resonance pro-
duction), followed by other resonances, at higher energies, but with much less
importance. Due to the multitude of open channels in these processes, some
simplifying hypothesis have been done [10].

The process of partitioning the energy of the recoil nuclei (produced due the
interaction of the incident particle with the nucleus, placed in its lattice site) by
new interaction processes, between electrons (ionisation) and atomic motion
(displacements) is considered in the frame of the Lindhard theory [11].

The factor characterising recoil energy partition between ionisation and dis-
placements has been calculated analytically, solving the general equations of
the Lindhard theory in some physical approximations. Details about the hy-
pothesis used could be found in reference [12]. All curves start, at low energies,
from the same curve; they have at low energies identical values of the energy
spent into displacements, independent on the charge and mass number of the
recoil. At higher energies, the curves start to detach from this main branch.
This happens at lower energies if their charge and mass numbers are smaller.
The maximum energy transferred into displacements corresponds to recoils
of maximum possible charge and mass numbers. The curves present then a
smooth increase with the energy. For the energy range considered here, the
asymptotic limit of the displacement energy is not reached.

5

For binary compounds, the Lindhard curves have been calculated separately
for each component of the material, and the average weight Bragg additivity
has been used. In this case, a threshold for atomic displacements must be
considered for each atomic species and for each direction in the crystal. In
the concrete calculations, a weighted value, independent on the crystalline
direction has been used.

3 Results, discussions and some possible applications

The nuclear stopping power presents an energy dependence with a pronounced
maximum. It is greater for heavier incident particles: protons compared to
pions. In a given medium, the position of the maximum is the same for all
particles with the same charge. In ﬁgure 1, the nuclear energy loss in diamond,
silicon, silicon carbide, GaP, GaAs, InP, InAs and InSb is represented for
protons and pions respectively, as a function of their kinetic energy. In the
same medium, the position of the maximum is the same for pions and protons.

The behaviour of these materials in proton and pion ﬁelds is characterised by
the CPD. In Figure 2, the dependence of the CPD as a function of the protons
kinetic energy and medium mass number is presented for diamond, silicon, SiC
GaAs and InP - see reference [13] and references cited therein. The values for
diamond degradation are from reference [9], the corresponding ones for silicon
are averaged values from references [14] and [15], SiC - from reference [16] and
those for GaAs and InP are from reference [15]. Low kinetic energy protons
produce higher degradation in all materials. The discontinuity in the surface
is related to diﬀerences in the behaviour of the CPD for monoatomic materials
(or binary ones with close elements), and binary ones with remote elements
in the periodic table.

For pion induced degradation, the energy dependence of CPD (as well as of the
NIEL) presents two maxima, the relative importance of which depends on the
target mass number: one in the region of the ∆33 resonance, more pronounced
for light elements and compounds containing light elements, and another one
around 1 GeV kinetic energy, more pronounced for heavy elements. At higher
energies, an weak energy dependence is observed, and a general A3/2
average de-
pendence of the NIEL can be approximated [10,12]. In Figure 3, the CPD
for all analysed materials (diamond, Si, SiC, GaP, GaAs, InP, InAs, InSb) is
represented as a function of the pion kinetic energy and of material average
mass number. The diﬀerences in the behaviour of these materials are clearly
suggested by the discontinuity in the mesh surfaces.

In the energy range considered in the paper, it could be observed that the
CPD produced by pions and protons, and characterising the bulk degrada-

6

tion, are very diﬀerent and reﬂect the peculiarities of the interactions of the
two particles with the semiconductors. For pions, there are two maxima, one
in the region of the ∆33 resonance, corresponding to about 140 - 160 MeV
kinetic energy, and the other at higher energies, around 1 GeV. The relative
importance of these maxima depends on the mass number of the material.
In comparison with this behaviour, the CPD produced by protons decreases
abruptly with the increase of energy at low energies, followed by a smooth and
slow increase at higher energies.

In relation to their behaviour in pion ﬁelds, these materials could be separated
into two classes, the ﬁrst with monoatomic materials or materials with rela-
tively close mass numbers (diamond, silicon, GaAs and InSb), and the second
comprising binary materials with remote mass numbers of the elements (SiC,
GaP, InP, InAs) with similar behaviours inside each group. The diamond is
the hardest material from all considered here. A slow variation of the primary
defect concentration has been found for pion irradiation of diamond, silicon,
SiC, GaP and GaAs, in the whole energy range of interest, with less than
2 displacements/cm/unit of ﬂuence. In contrast to these materials, there are
others, characterised by a low CPD in the energy range up to 200 MeV, (which
represents this way the upper limit of the energy range where their utilisation
in pion ﬁeld is recommended), followed by a pronounced increase of displace-
ment concentration with energy to more than 8 displacements/cm/unit ﬂuence
for InSb.

It is to be mentioned that, in the present model hypothesis, for SiC, negligible
diﬀerences have been found between diﬀerent polytypes in what regards the
eﬀects of pion and proton degradation [16], conclusions in accord with the
experimental results [17]. The behaviour of SiC in radiation ﬁelds is between
the corresponding one of diamond and silicon.

As it is well known, the analysed semiconductors are possible materials for de-
tectors and electronic devices which have to work long time in particle physics
experiments, space applications, etc., in intense ﬁelds of hadrons, and in ex-
perimental conﬁgurations which impose high reliability of devices, and must
present a controlled degradation of their parameters. As possible applications
we will analyse two hypothetical cases: the utilisation of diamond, silicon, SiC
or GaAs as detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, and the
long time exposure of the electronic devices in the ﬁeld produced by cosmic
rays.

For the LHC, the standard physics programme is based on the study of proton
- proton interactions, at about 7 TeV beam energy, on an integrated luminos-
ity of 5x105 pb−1 which corresponds to 9 year of operation, for an annual
operation time of 1.9x107 s. The irradiation background is continuous. The
charged hadrons are produced in the primary interactions, while the neutrons

7

are albedo particles. The charged pions are the dominant particles, followed
by protons, antiprotons and kaons. As an illustration of the above calculations
for the degradation of diﬀerent semiconductors in proton and pion ﬁelds, the
results of the simulation of Gorﬁne and Taylor [18] have been chosen, for pion
and proton ﬂuxes in the inner detector assembly region, parallel to the beam
axis. Both protons and pions are transported down to thermal energies in
the detector, by nuclear interactions. The particle ﬂux energy spectra have
been simulated for a ﬁrst layer of Si detectors (situated at 11.5 cm), and with
complete moderator. The obtained spectra have been found to be slowly de-
pendent on the material of the inner detector and so, in the present paper the
same hadron spectra for diamond, silicon carbide, silicon and gallium arsenide
have been utilised.

The convolution of the pion and proton spectra with the energy dependence
of the CPD has been done in the energy range 50 MeV - 10 GeV, and 10
MeV - 10 GeV for pions and protons respectively. Below 50 MeV, a realistic
estimation of materials degradation to pions is very diﬃcult due to the lack
of experimental data on pion - nucleus interaction and also to the increase of
the weight of Coulomb interaction.

The results of these calculations are summarised in Fig. 4, for the diamond,
silicon carbide, silicon and GaAs options, both for pion and proton degra-
dation. In the analysed case, diamond and SiC are the hardest materials in
both pion and proton ﬁelds; the diamond is harder to pions than to protons.
The behaviour of silicon is similar in both particle ﬁelds. The GaAs option
is not recommended because of an order of magnitude higher degradation in
comparation with all other considered materials.

Another possible utilisation of semiconductor devices in radiation ﬁelds is
related to space applications. In the primary cosmic radiation, the most abun-
dant particles are the protons [5]. Other charged particles (for example π+/−,
e+/−, µ+/−, νmu, etc.) are produced in the interaction of the primary cosmic
rays in air. The damage induced in diamond, Si, SiC, GaAs and InP by the
primary cosmic ﬁeld has been estimated for protons in the energy range 10
MeV - 10 GeV, and the results are presented in Figure 5. The devices have
been supposed to be exposed directly to the cosmic ﬁeld. In this case too,
diamond has been found to be the hardest material. GaAs and InP suﬀer a
degradation of a factor of about 50 times higher in comparation with diamond
and this behaviour can aﬀect irreversibly the properties of these materials for
long time operation.

The degradation produced by the particle ﬁeld at LHC (pions and protons)
and by the free protons from the primary cosmic rays respectively are of the
same order of magnitude for each of the materials investigated.

4 Summary

A systematic theoretical study has been performed, investigating the interac-
tion of charged hadrons with semiconductor materials and the mechanisms of
defect creation by irradiation.

The nuclear stopping power has been found to be greater for heavier incident
particles (protons compared to pions), and for lighter media. The position of
its maximum is the same for protons and pions in the same medium.

The mechanisms of the primary interaction of the hadron with the nucleus
(nuclei) of the semiconductor lattice have been explicitly modelled and the
Lindhard theory of the partition between ionisation and displacements has
been applied.

For protons, the low kinetic energy particles produce higher degradation in all
materials.

For pions, the energy dependence of CPD presents two maxima, the relative
importance of which depends on the target mass number: one in the region of
the ∆33 resonance, more pronounced for light elements and compounds con-
taining light elements, and another one around 1 GeV kinetic energy, more
pronounced for heavy elements. At higher energies, an weak energy depen-
dence is observed. A slow variation of the primary defect concentration has
been found for pion irradiation of diamond, silicon, GaP and GaAs, in the
whole energy range of interest, with less than 2 displacements/cm/unit of
ﬂuence. In contrast to this situation, for the other semiconductor materials
analysed, a low CPD is estimated in the energy range up to 200 MeV (which
represent the energy range up to their utilisation in pion ﬁeld is recommended),
followed by a pronounced increase of displacement concentration to more than
to more than 8 displacements/cm/unit of ﬂuence at high energies.

The behaviour of this semiconductor materials has been analysed compara-
tively both in relation to particle physics experiments (inner part of the detec-
tion system at LHC) and to space applications (the devices being considered
to be exposed directly to the cosmic ray ﬁeld.

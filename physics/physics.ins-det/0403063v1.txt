The ALICE High-Level Trigger proesses data online, to either selet interesting (sub-) events, or to ompress

data e(cid:30)iently by modeling tehniques. Fousing on the main data soure, the Time Pro jetion Chamber, the

arhiteure of the system and the urrent state of the traking and ompression methods are outlined.

The ALICE experiment desribed in [1,2,3℄ will

allel omputing system, the High-Level Trigger

investigate Pb(cid:21)Pb ollisions at a enter of mass

energy of about 5.5 TeV per nuleon pair and pp
ollisions at 14 TeV. Its detetors are optimized

for heavy-ion reations at an antiipated harged

partile multipliity of up to dNch/dη of 8000 in

(HLT) system, is being designed [6℄.

The key requirement for the HLT system is the

ability to perform the event analysis in real-time.

Based on the extrated information, harge lus-

3. Online Pattern Reognition

In general, the HLT system has to reonstrut

the omplete event information online. Conern-

ing the TPC and the other traking devies, the

partiles ideally follow helial tra jetories due to

the solenoidal magneti (cid:28)eld of the L3 magnet

surrounding these entral detetors.

For HLT traking, we distinguish two di(cid:27)erent

approahes:

the (cid:16)sequential feature extration(cid:17)

and the (cid:16)iterative feature extration(cid:17) [9,10℄.

Abstract

We have examined long term changes in signal amplitude gain, energy res-
olution and detection eﬃciency for the active components of the PIBETA de-
tector system. Beam deﬁning plastic scintillation counters were operated in a
∼ 1 MHz stopped π+ beam for a period of 297 days, accumulating radiation
doses of up to 2 · 106 rad. Detectors in the charged particle tracking system—a
pair of cylindrical multi-wire proportional chambers and a thin plastic scintilla-
tion barrel-shaped hodoscope array—were irradiated during the same running
period with an average dose of ∼ 4 · 104 rad. Individual CsI(undoped crystal)
calorimeter detectors received an average dose of ∼ 120 rad, mainly from pho-
tons, positrons and protons originating from π+ hadronic interactions as well
as from π+ and µ+ weak decays at rest in the active target.

Keywords: Long term temporal stability of detector gain, energy resolu-
tion and detection eﬃciency, radiation hardness, radiation resistance, radiation
damage.

1. Introduction

The PIBETA collaboration has proposed a program of precise measurements of
rare π and µ decays at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) [1], with particular emphasis
on the pion beta decay branching ratio, Γ(π+ → π0e+νe).

The PIBETA apparatus is a large solid angle non-magnetic detector optimized

for detection of photons and electrons in the energy range of 5–150 MeV with high
eﬃciency, energy resolution and solid angle. The main sensitive components of the

apparatus, shown and labeled in Fig. 1, are:

(1) BC, a thin forward beam counter placed approximately 4 m upstream of the
detector center, AC1 and AC2, two cylindrical active collimators, AD, an active

degrader, all made of plastic scintillator and used for beam deﬁnition;

(2) AT, a 9-element segmented active plastic scintillator target, used to stop the

beam particles while simultaneously sampling the lateral beam proﬁle;

(3) MWPC1 and MWPC2, two concentric low-mass cylindrical multi-wire propor-
tional chambers for charged particle tracking, surrounding the active target;

(4) PV, a fast 20-bar segmented thin plastic scintillator hodoscope, surrounding the

MWPCs, used for particle identiﬁcation;

(5) a 240-element fast high-resolution segmented spherical pure-CsI shower calorim-
eter surrounding the target region and tracking detectors, subtending a solid
angle of ∼ 80 % of 4π;

(6) CV, a set of cosmic muon plastic scintillator veto counters around the entire

apparatus, not shown in Fig. 1.

The detector components listed above, together with delay cables for photomul-

tiplier tube (PMT) analog signals, high voltage (HV) supplies and cables, MWPC
instrumentation and gas system, fast trigger electronics, two front end computers
(one for data acquisition, the other for slow control), as well as the temperature con-

trol system, are all mounted on a single platform that is moved as a single unit in
and out of the experimental area. Thus, the detector can become fully operational in

less than 24 hours after the support platform is precisely positioned with respect to
the beam line, and electrical power and Ethernet connections are made.

The building and testing of the detector components were completed in 1998,

followed by the assembly and commissioning of the full detector apparatus. Data
acquisition with the PIBETA detector started in the second half of 1999, initially at
a reduced pion stopping rate, as planned. Since then, the pion stopping rate was

gradually increased and the experiment ran during most of the available beam period
in the years 2000 and 2001 at ∼ 1 MHz π+ stopping rate.

In all important respects the detector has met its design speciﬁcations. In this

paper we report on the radiation resistance and the temporal stability of the gain,
energy resolution, and detection eﬃciency of the most aﬀected active elements of the

PIBETA detector listed above.

Radiation stability of the plastic scintillator detectors used in high energy and
nuclear physics experiments is one of their main characteristics, and as such has

been discussed in a voluminous body of research and review papers. Here we note a
review paper by G. Marini et al. [2] and Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], as well as references

therein. These papers address the issue of experimentally determining and improving
the radiation hardness of plastic scintillators.

Radiation hardness of pure (undoped) CsI scintillators has been reported in Refs.

[9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

2. Experimental Analysis

The PIBETA measurements are performed in the πE1 channel at PSI [14]. For
this experiment the beam line is operated in the high intensity, low momentum reso-
lution mode. Correspondingly, a 114 MeV/c π+ beam tune has been developed with
momentum spread of ∆p/p ≤ 1.2 % and maximum nominal π+ beam intensity of
Iπ ≃ 2 · 106 π+/s.

The spatial spread of the π+ beam is restricted by a 10 cm thick lead collimator
with a (cid:31) 7 mm pin-hole located 3985 mm upstream of the detector center. Beam
particles are ﬁrst registered in the 2 mm thick plastic scintillator (BC) placed directly
downstream of the collimator. Pions are subsequently slowed down in the 40 mm long
active plastic degrader (AD), and stopped in the active plastic target (AT) positioned

in the center of the PIBETA detector, Fig. 1.

We have analyzed a total of 6213 production runs, for which data were accumu-
lated between 9 October 1999 and 11 December 2000. This data set comprises a total
number of 1.4 · 1013 beam π+’s stopped in the active target. The e+ and µ+ beam
contaminations measured in the BC–AT time-of-ﬂight spectrum are small, ∼ 1.3 %
and ∼ 0.3 %, respectively. Therefore, the in-beam detectors were exposed primarily
to pions, while the AT counters also received signiﬁcant doses from the stopped pion
decay products: π → µ → e. Particle discrimination between the positrons, photons
and protons detected in the CsI calorimeter is accomplished using the charged particle
tracking detector components, i.e., MWPC1,2 and PV, the plastic veto hodoscope.

All individual detector PMT analog signals are discriminated in time-over-thresh-

old CAMAC modules and counted with CAMAC scaler units read out every 10 s.
The cumulative scaler counts are updated at the end of every production run in the
online database, as well as saved in a computer disk ﬁle.

The most probable, as well as the average, energy deposited in each detector
element are calculated in a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation using the standard detector

description code GEANT3 [15]. The GEANT simulation also provided the average
values of radiation exposure throughout the detectors’ volumes.

The total energy absorbed per unit detector mass exposed to radiation com-
prises the received radiation dose. The absorbed radiation dose for each detector

is commonly expressed in units of rad [16], corresponding to the energy absorption
of 100 erg/g. The equivalent SI unit is 1 Gray equaling 100 rad (1 Gy = 1 Joule/kg).

The absorbed radiation doses for each PIBETA active detector element are calculated
using the experimental and MC data on ionizing particle types, cumulative particle

rates and exposed detector volumes. The PIBETA detector absorbed doses are listed
in Tables 1 and 2.

The absolute energy calibration as well as the shapes of experimental deposited
energy (ADC) spectra are well understood in the MC GEANT simulations. The peaks

in the ADC spectra accumulated for each series of 10 runs are ﬁtted with Gaussian
functions in oﬄine analysis. The means of the Gaussian functions determine the

relative detector gain factors, while the standard deviations of the lower parts of the
ADC spectra loosely reﬂect the detector energy resolutions.

The PMT bias high voltages were in general kept constant, except for the CsI cal-

orimeter PMTs. The demand HV values were set in 1 V steps with an accuracy and
reproducibility of ≃ 1 V, which corresponds to an equivalent gain change of < 0.5 %.
For the 220 non-peripheral CsI calorimeter detectors high voltages were adjusted

automatically by the online analysis computer program on a daily basis. Firm con-
straints were imposed on the location of the π → eν energy peaks. The latter were
always forced to the normalized 67.8 MeV value by changing the PMT high voltages
and adjusting the calorimeter software gains appropriately.

For a detector equipped with an n-stage PMT operating in the linear domain, a
normalized real gain change g, relating two diﬀerent settings 1 and 2 (at time t1 and
t2, respectively), depends on the ratio of the software gains si and the corresponding
high voltages HVi:

3. Plastic Scintillator Beam Counters

3.1. Forward Beam Counter (BC)

The forward beam counter BC is the ﬁrst detector placed right after the beam-
deﬁning lead collimator. This counter tags the beam particles that have passed
through the collimator.

The central part of the beam counter is a quadratic piece of BICRON BC-400
plastic scintillator [17] with dimensions 25 × 25 × 2 mm3. The scintillator is optically
coupled on all four sides to four tapered acrylic lightguides. One lightguide is glued to

the scintillator edge surface with BICRON BC-600 optical cement. The other three
lightguides have an air gap coupling to the scintillator.

Both the scintillator and the lightguides are mounted inside a light-tight enclosure.
This detector-carrying box consists of an aluminum frame with outer dimensions
150 × 150 × 50 mm3, covered by two thin aluminum windows, each 30 µm thick.
The Al frame is attached to the lead collimator and keeps the counter position ﬁxed.

Feedthroughs at the four lateral sides of the box hold the light guides and the magnetic
shield cylinders of the PMTs. The box is therefore also used as a mount for the

photomultipliers, while keeping the scintillator counter light-tight and protecting it
mechanically.

Each of the four lightguides is air-gap coupled to a Hamamatsu R7400U mini-
PM tube. The stabilized active PMT voltage divider was specially designed at the

University of Virginia for high rate operation, because typical counter rates are >
2 MHz. The four analog PMT signals are electronically summed in a NIM LCR 428F

linear Fan-in/fan-out unit set up in the experimental beam area.

The analog pulses from the beam counter are divided by a custom-made passive
splitter into two signals of equal amplitude. One signal is discriminated in a CA-
MAC discriminator module; discriminator output is digitized in a FASTBUS Time-

to-Digital Converter (TDC) as well as counted with a CAMAC scaler unit. The
second signal is connected to a FASTBUS Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), gated

with a 100 ns event trigger gate. Similar electronic logic is used with other individual
PIBETA detectors discussed in the following sections.

In order to suppress the background caused by detector hits not associated with a

π-stop event we use two active beam collimators AC1 and AC2. Both collimators are
ring-shaped and are made of a 25.4 mm thick BICRON BC-400 plastic scintillator.
AC1, the ﬁrst (upstream) ring counter, has an outer diameter of 120 mm and an inner

6

diameter of 50 mm. AC2, closer to the detector center, has the outer/inner diameter
of 172/90 mm, respectively. These dimensions were chosen such that the detectors

subtend the various beam tube elements and mechanical support parts of the detector
without intersecting the calculated envelope of the beam.

The deposited energy (ADC signal charge) spectrum of the forward beam counter
recorded with the π-in-beam trigger is shown in Fig. 2. Most probable energy depo-
sition by a π+ beam particle corresponds to 0.70 MeV, while the average absorbed
energy is 0.80 MeV. These values are calculated with a GEANT Monte Carlo code
using a 114 MeV/c π+ beam as an input. The slope of the low-energy ridge of the
deposited energy spectrum in BC is determined by a convolution of the Vavilov proba-

bility distribution and the PMT photoelectron statistics. Since the latter deteriorates
with radiation damage, the slope of the low-energy edge of the ADC spectrum can be

used as a rough indicator of the eﬀects of radiation damage on detector resolution, in
the absence of a sharp monoenergetic line. We have used the same approach for the
other PIBETA plastic scintillator detectors discussed below: AD, AT, PV.

Figure 2: Energy deposition (ADC signal charge) spectrum of 114 MeV/c π+’s in BC,
the thin forward beam counter. Gaussian ﬁt parameters for the lower energy part of
the peak are showed in the statistics window.

Fig. 3 depicts the changes in the BC detector gain and fractional energy resolution
as the detector became damaged by radiation over time. It is evident from Fig. 3

that the gain of the BC counter decreased approximately linearly over the period of
one calendar year due to the radiation exposure of 2 Mrad. The decrease in gain

7

was ≃ 20 %/Mrad. The fractional energy resolution for through-going pions was also
slightly degraded, changing from 13.1 % to 13.9 %, as shown in the bottom panel of

Fig. 3. Two beam breaks in the radiation exposure, totaling 98 days and 35 days,
respectively, resulted in a partial beam counter recuperation and gain increases of
≃ 10–15 %. The annealing eﬀect on the counter resolution is smaller, though still
measurable.

function of the absorbed radiation dose in Mrad. Bottom panel: fractional energy
resolution of the BC detector as a function of the cumulative radiation dose in Mrad.

3.2. Active Degrader (AD)

The active degrader counter is made of BICRON BC-400 plastic scintillating ma-
terial in the shape of a cup whose axis is aligned with the beam. The AD ﬁts inside
MWPC1 which has an inner clearance of (cid:31) 90 mm. The AD outer surfaces are slanted
and connect to four acrylic lightguides. This geometry brings the PMTs out of the

inner region, at the same time ensuring that the active part of AD (cup “bottom”)
covers the whole target area (40 mm diameter). The angle and wall thickness of the

outer part of the AD are chosen such that a particle traveling parallel to the beam axis
transverses the same thickness of 30 mm. The angle is kept small in order to improve
light collection eﬃciency. Each of the four ﬁshtail lightguides ends in a rectangular
cross section of 6 × 6 mm2, which matches the round window area of the Hamamatsu
R7400U PMT. The tubes are mounted with an air gap coupling. The four AD PMT

analog signals are summed in a NIM LCR 428F linear Fan-in/fan-out unit.

Figure 4: ADC charge spectrum of the moderated π+’s in the AD counter. A Gaussian
ﬁt (solid curve) is superimposed on the data histogram (points).

The deposited energy (ADC charge) spectrum of the active degrader counter taken

with the π-in-beam trigger is shown in Fig. 4. The lower energy part of the deposited
energy spectrum is again ﬁtted well with a Gaussian function. Most probable energy
deposition of the 114 MeV/c incident π+ beam is calculated with the GEANT code
to be equal to 13.0 MeV, while the average energy absorbed is 13.8 MeV. During the
period under analysis the degrader counter was irradiated with a dose of 1.4 Mrad.

9

The changes in the relative counter gain and energy resolution are shown in the two
panels of Fig. 5. Both variables are subject to short-term variations, mostly due to

changes in the beam tune. There is, however, an average linear trend in the scintillator
gain factor corresponding to 15 %/Mrad decrease. The temporal degradation in the

AD energy resolution is much smaller but still noticeable.

radiation dose in Mrad. Bottom panel: the energy resolution of the active degrader
as a function of the cumulative radiation dose in Mrad.

3.3. Active Stopping Target (AT)

The PIBETA active target, AT, is a cylindrical plastic scintillator counter 50 mm
long with a diameter of 40 mm. The counter is segmented into 9 elements, as shown
schematically in Fig. 1b. A (cid:31) 7 mm central cylinder is surrounded by 4 identical
tubular segments that compose an inner ring with outer (cid:31) 30.0 mm. The second, outer
target ring is made of 4 tubular segments rotated by 45◦ with respect to the inner ring
(cf. Fig. 1b). The 9 pieces are wrapped individually in aluminized Mylar foil isolating

them optically from each other. The segments are pressed together and the whole
modular assembly is wrapped with black plastic tape. Each target element is acting
as an independent counter, viewed by a miniature (8 mm photo-cathode) Hamamatsu

R7400U photomultiplier tube via a 60 mm long, tapered acrylic lightguide.

Figure 6: Deposited energy spectrum of stopping pions in the central active target
segment. Parameters P1–P3 correspond to a Gaussian function, the values P4 and
P5 describe a square-root tail function ﬁt.

The uncalibrated deposited energy (ADC) spectrum of the central target segment

T0 recorded with the π-in-beam trigger is depicted in Fig. 6. The events in which the
stopping pion deposits its full energy in the target element are clearly distinguished in

the high-energy peak. The peak is well described by a Gaussian form with a square-
root function tail. The GEANT simulation predicts a peak position at 27.6 MeV,
and the average energy deposited in the central target segment T0 of 16.6 MeV. The

events with a stopping particle sharing energy between two or more target segments

11

due to scattering or to beam divergence, fall into the low energy tail. The same low
energy tail is also populated by positrons from delayed weak pion and muon decays.

In Table 1 we give the starting and ﬁnal gains and resolutions for the three rep-

resentative target segments. The measured temporal variation in the gain factor and
energy resolution of the central target segment over the 15 month period is depicted in
Fig. 7. The cumulative absorbed radiation dose is calculated to be 0.5 Mrad. A consid-
erable fall-oﬀ in the gain of the T0 scintillator is evident in the ﬁgure: ≃ 52 %/Mrad.

Figure 7: Top panel: the gain of AT0, the central target segment, as a function of the
absorbed radiation dose in Mrad. Bottom panel: the energy resolution of the AT0
counter as a function of the cumulative radiation dose in Mrad.

12

As in the AD counter, the energy resolution is subject to short-term variations caused
by changes in the beam spot geometry. Over the analyzed period, though, the reso-

lution was degraded by a full 80 %. This level of radiation damage makes it necessary
to make available identical copies of the AT detector for periodic replacement. The

radiation damaged PIBETA target assembly has been replaced annually with new
target detectors.

4. Multiwire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs)

MWPC1 and MWPC2 are a pair of cylindrical multiwire proportional chambers,

each with one anode wire plane along the beam direction, and two cathode strip
planes in stereoscopic geometry. A general description of the design and operation of

the “Dubna”-type cylindrical chambers is given in Ref. [18]. The PIBETA detector
cylindrical MWPCs are described in more detail in Refs. [19, 20]. In this section we
analyze the chamber detection eﬃciencies measured with minimum ionizing particles.

The detection eﬃciency ǫ of MWPC1 for minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) can be
measured using copious µ+ → e+ν ¯ν (Michel) positrons emanating from the stopping
target:

ǫMWPC1 =

N(AT · MWPC1 · MWPC2 · PV · CsI)
N(AT · MWPC2 · PV · CsI)

,

(2)

where the N’s represent the number of Michel events for which all the detectors in
the parenthesis register coincident hits above their discriminator threshold. The CsI
calorimeter signal is discriminated with a low threshold level (≃ 5 MeV), while a
software cut on the PV deposited energy spectrum selects MIP events (Fig. 8). An
equivalent expression, obtained by substituting 2 for the index 1, holds for MWPC2.
The average MWPC detection eﬃciencies at the ≃ 1 MHz π+ beam stopping rate are
> 95 % and > 98 % for the inner and outer chambers, respectively. Oﬄine analysis of

the individual chamber eﬃciencies for the period under consideration, which involved
∼ 1.4 · 1013 (mostly minimum ionizing) particles, found no degradation within the
measurement uncertainty (Table 2).

5. Plastic Scintillator Hodoscope (PV)

The PV (plastic veto) hodoscope is located inside the CsI calorimeter and sur-
rounds the two concentric wire chambers, as shown in Fig. 1. The hodoscope array

consists of 20 thin independent plastic scintillator bars that are arranged to form a
complete cylinder with a 129 mm radius and a 598 mm long axis that coincides with

13

the beam line and the target axis. The PV hodoscope covers the entire geometrical
solid angle subtended by the CsI calorimeter as seen from the target center.

A single PV detector element consists of four main components: (1) thin plastic

scintillator bar, (2) two lightguides, one at each end, (3) two photomultiplier tubes,
one per lightguide, and (4) aluminized Mylar wrapping.

The dimensions of the individual plastic bars made of BC-400 scintillator are
3.18 × 41.9 × 598 mm3. Each thin plastic scintillator bar, along with the attached
lightguides, is wrapped in 0.25 µm thick aluminized Mylar foil to optically separate it
from the adjacent bars, and to provide a reﬂective surface that increases the amount

of light reaching the phototubes. Scintillation light is viewed by two Burle Industries
S83062E photomultiplier tubes, one on each end. These tubes are (cid:31) 28 mm head-on
fast PMTs with 10 stages.

The hodoscope array is supported from the inside by a 530 mm long carbon ﬁber
cylinder with a total thickness of 1 mm, corresponding to 5.3 · 10−3 radiation lengths.
The hodoscope modules are kept tight around the support cylinder by a helix-wound,

thin plastic string tensioned at the extreme ends of the detector stand.

The PV charged particle detection eﬃciency is evaluated separately for minimum-
ionizing positrons with total energy above 5 MeV and for non-relativistic protons with

kinetic energy in the range 10-150 MeV. Fig. 8 shows the measured energy spectrum
of positrons and protons in the PV detector, corrected for the angle of incidence.

particles (mostly e+’s,

14

At the nominal π+ stopping rate the individual plastic scintillator phototubes are
counting at the rate of ∼ 130 kHz, while the entire PV hodoscope is taking ∼ 0.88 M
hits/sec. The total radiation dose absorbed by the PV hodoscope array throughout
the analyzed period is 40 krad.

A charged particle track is deﬁned by the coincident hits in the active target, AT,
two wire chambers, MWPC1 and MWPC2, and the CsI calorimeter, CsI. The PV

detection eﬃciency is deﬁned as the following ratio:

ǫPV =

N(AT · MWPC1 · MWPC2 · PV · CsI)
N(AT · MWPC1 · MWPC2 · CsI)

,

(3)

where each N represents the number of events satisfying the condition in the paren-
thesis. The average PV detection eﬃciency measured during the detector commis-
sioning period was ǫPV ≥ 99.0 % (Table 2). No signiﬁcant long term change in the
PV detection eﬃciency was observed.

As for the previously discussed detectors, Table 1 lists the starting and ﬁnal gains
and resolutions for two representative PV detectors. The temporal dependence of the

detector light output for PV bar number 1 is shown in Fig. 9. Its gain factor dropped
by 0.25 %/krad, giving a cumulative degradation over the production period of 10 %.

The energy resolution on the other hand shows a barely measurable change.

The charged particle tracking system, combining the information from the PV
hodoscope and the MWPC pair achieves MIP tracking ineﬃciency in the range (1.0 ±
0.2) · 10−5 while operating in the environment of ∼ 1 MHz stopped π+’s in the target.

6. Pure CsI Calorimeter Modules

The shower calorimeter lies at the heart of the PIBETA detector. Pure (undoped)

CsI single crystal (Refs. [21, 22, 23]) was chosen as the calorimeter material.

The PIBETA calorimeter consists of 240 pure CsI crystals. Spherical geometry is

obtained by the ten-frequency class II geodesic triangulation of an icosahedron [24].
The chosen geodesic division results in 220 hexagonal and pentagonal truncated pyra-
mids covering a total solid angle of 0.77 × 4π sr. Additional 20 crystals surround
two detector openings for the beam entry and detector access and act as electro-

magnetic shower leakage vetoes. The inner radius of the crystal ball is 260 mm,
and the axial module length is 220 mm, corresponding to 12 radiation lengths, as
X0(CsI) = 18.5 mm [25].

absorbed radiation dose in krad. Bottom panel: fractional energy resolution of the
forward PV counter number 1 as a function of the cumulative radiation dose in krad.
The discontinuity in the fractional resolution plot around 10 krad is related to a
servicing operation.

16

There are nine diﬀerent detector module shapes: four irregular hexagonal trun-
cated pyramids (labeled Hex-A, Hex-B, Hex-C, and Hex-D, respectively), one regular

pentagonal (Pent) and two irregular half-hexagonal truncated pyramids (Hex-D1 and
Hex-D2), plus two trapezohedrons which function as calorimeter vetoes (Vet-1 and
Vet-2). The volumes of the PIBETA CsI detector modules vary from 797 cm3 (Hex-
D1/2) to 1718 cm3 (Hex-C).

The ﬁrst 25 PIBETA crystals were manufactured in the Bicron Corporation fa-
cility in Newbury, Ohio [17]. The remaining 215 CsI scintillators were grown in the

Institute for Single Crystals in Harkov (AMCRYS), Ukraine. Preliminary quality
control, including the optical and mechanical crystal properties, was performed at

the production sites.

After completing physical measurements, all crystal surfaces were hand-polished
with a mixture of 0.2 µm aluminum oxide powder and etylenglycol. The surfaces
of each CsI crystal were then painted with a special organo-silicon mixture. The

wavelength-shifting lacquer developed by the Harkov Single Crystals Research Insti-
tute [26] provides an optical treatment of crystal surfaces superior to more common

matting or wrapping treatments. The lacquer contains a wavelength-shifting ladder
organosilicon copolymer with the chemical composition PPO+POPOP+COUM.1,

where PPO is 2.5–Diphenyloxazole, POPOP represents 1.4-Di-2-(5-Phenyloxazolile-
Benzene) and COUM.1 is 7-Diethylamine-4-Methylcoumarin [27].

EMI 9822QKB 10-stage fast photomultipliers [28] with (cid:31) 75 mm end windows are
attached to the back faces of hexagonal and pentagonal CsI crystals using a 300 µm

layer of silicone Sylgard 184 elastomer (Dow Corning RTV silicone rubber plus cat-
alyst). The resulting crystal–photomultiplier tube couplings are strong and perma-

nent, but can be broken by application of a substantial tangential force. Smaller
half-hexagonal and trapezial detector modules are equipped with (cid:31) 46 mm 10-stage
EMI 9211QKA phototubes [28]. Both photocathodes have quartz windows transmit-
ting photons down to 175 nm. The window transparency, peaking at ∼ 380 nm [28],
is approximately matched to the spectral excitation of a pure CsI fast scintillation
light component with a peak emission at ∼ 310 nm at room temperature [29].

Calibrated energy spectra of the calorimeter detector show that the individual
modules receive between 5 and 10 MeV energy depositions in a large sample of events

averaged over all physics triggers. The accumulated radiation doses for individual
CsI counters have been between 40 rad and 160 rad, Table 1.

A deposited energy (ADC) spectrum, calibrated in MeV and representing a sum

17

of ADC values for one CsI detector and its nearest neighbors, is shown as an exam-
ple in Fig. 10. The event trigger is a high threshold (≃ 52 MeV) delayed π+ gate
trigger that preferentially selects both µ → eν ¯ν positrons which have a continuous
energy spectrum with a 52.5 MeV endpoint, and the monoenergetic 70 MeV π → eν
positrons. The µ decay positron spectrum is clipped on the left very near its end-
point by the ≃ 52 MeV trigger discriminator threshold. The monoenergetic π decay
positron line is used for the automatic, computer-controlled gain matching of the

individual CsI detectors.

Figure 10: Calibrated energy spectrum of a single CsI detector (CsI HEX-A module
S011, 10 runs). The higher energy peak at ∼ 68 MeV represents monoenergetic
π+ → e+ν positrons, the lower part of the spectrum is populated by µ+ → e+ν ¯ν
Michel positrons cut by a ∼ 52 MeV trigger discriminator threshold.

Because both the software gain factors and the PMT high voltages of all CsI
counters are varied after each run, the relevant real gain factors are deﬁned by Eq. (1).

Representative gain variations for three diﬀerent CsI detectors are shown in Figs. 11–
13. These measurements show diﬀerent gain degradation rates of up to ≥ 40 %/rad.
An increase in gain following extended beam breaks is a common feature of the CsI
light response, as seen in the three ﬁgures.

The overall CsI calorimeter gain and energy resolution are determined from cali-
brated experimental energy spectra of all 240 CsI detectors. The results are summa-

rized in Table 1. As it accumulated an average radiation dose of 119 rad the PIBETA
calorimeter gain decreased 17 % and the overall energy resolution was lowered from

5.5 % to 6.0 %. This decrease, however, should not be attributed entirely to radiation
damage, as the crystals were subject to other sources of performance degradation

over time: absorption of humidity on the crystal surfaces, slow plastic deformation of
individual modules under pressure (CsI is highly malleable, while the detectors are
self-supporting, with the entire weight of over 1 ton distributed among the elements).

Thus, the above performance degradation provides a very loose upper limit on the
radiation eﬀects on pure CsI.

7. Conclusions

We have analyzed the temporal changes in gains, energy resolutions and detection
eﬃciencies of the active elements of the PIBETA detector during 15 month period

of production data taking. We ﬁnd measurable decreases in energy gains and degra-
dations in energy resolutions, in particular for the beam detectors that were exposed

to high radiation doses as well as for more radiation-sensitive pure CsI calorimeter
modules. These changes in the detector responses are monitored online throughout

the production running and documented in the replay data analysis. The changes af-

20

fect the energy calibration of the PIBETA detector elements and have to be properly
taken into account when deﬁning the software energy cuts in the physics analysis of

rare pion and muon decays.

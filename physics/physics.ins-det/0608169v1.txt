Abstract

This note describes a study of the possibilities for selecting an electron calibration stream using
the High level electron trigger (Level 2 and the event ﬁlter). Using the electromagnetic calorimeter
reconstruction and the track reconstruction algorithms, an evaluation has been performed of the selec-
tion efﬁciencies and purities for different physics channels with single or double electrons in the ﬁnal
state. A study of the calibration stream composition, including the background from QCD processes,
is presented.

1 Introduction

According to the ATLAS Computing Model, we expect to have four event data streams produced
from the HLT (high level trigger) system: a physics stream dedicated to the reconstruction of the full
ATLAS event sample; an express line stream to rapidly monitor calibration and reconstruction quality
on a subset of events before the complete reconstruction is run on the physics stream, and to look for
interesting and unusual events; a pathological stream to study events causing problems for the HLT;
and ﬁnally a calibration stream, processed rapidly and used to obtain the calibration constants for the
physics stream reconstruction. The calibration stream will itself be divided into several sub-streams
with different types of events. In particular, this study is devoted to the calibration stream for the
electrons [1].

Using the High Level Trigger algorithms, described in detail in section 2.1, we have studied the

expected rates and purity of the electron stream as a function of the luminosity of the LHC.

2 Tools

In this section all the software tools used are brieﬂy described. All the selection cuts applied and their
meanings are deﬁned. Moreover, there is a description of the datasets used in the analysis.

In detail, all the cuts applied for each trigger hypothesis algorithm are summerized in the table 1.

The values of the thresholds are those presented in a recent talk on the trigger performance [6].

2.1 Software Tools

The selection at the High Level Trigger (HLT) [2] is seeded by the information obtained at Level 1
(i.e. Regions-of-Interest, RoI). The level 2 trigger reduces drastically the number of events with
a relatively small latency, using the information contained in the RoI, while the ﬁnal trigger level,
the event ﬁlter, having fewer constraints on the latency, reﬁnes the selections using the full event
information. After the HLT, we obtain typically “Physics Objects”; these are: muons, electrons,
jets. In this case we studied the Trigger Menu for the electron objects, in particular the selection
signatures: e25i, selecting single electrons with a threshold of 25 GeV, and 2e15i, for di-electron
events containing two electron candidates with at least 15 GeV. The selection criteria for electrons
include a shower-shape analysis in the electromagnetic calorimeter, a search for high pT tracks and
a matching between the clusters and the tracks. The selections applied at each trigger level are as
follows:

• Level 1

• Level 2

The particles are selected using the Electromagnetic Calorimeter information, applying cuts on
the transvere energy (ET ) in the cluster and isolation criteria around the clusters (using both
hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, with reduced granularity information compared to
that available in the HLT). Each RoI is characterised by: η, φ, Ethreshold
and isolation criteria.

T

Starting from the LVL1 region of interest (RoI) of size ∆η × ∆φ = 0.2 × 0.2, the level 2
algorithms reﬁne the selections using the full granularity of the detector. Electrons are selected
using both the calorimeter information and tracking information. The shower shapes in the
calorimeter and the tracks reconstructed in the inner detector near the calorimeter clusters are

analyzed, applying selection cuts on E/p, ∆η and ∆φ, as described in detail in table 1 (L2
Calo Hypo and L2 Track Hypo algorithms).

• Event Filter

Starting from the Level 2 objects, the Event Filter reﬁnes the cuts using more sophisticated
algorithms, and access to full event information in the calorimeter and the inner detector. The
track search is performed in the SCT and pixel detectors and independently in the TRT. Finally,
the objects have to pass three sets of cuts: EF Calo Hypo, EF Track Hypo and EF Match
Hypo (checking the E/p and spatial matching between the objects found in the tracking and
calorimetry).

2.2

Preselection Cuts for e25i and 2e15i: Deﬁnition of Reference Electrons

All the analyses have been performed using the trigger selection hypothesis algorithms corresponding
to the HLT trigger chain as described in 2.1, together with with various preselection criteria. These
preselection criteria remove events which are not of interest, because they would not pass the level 1
trigger, would not pass ofﬂine reconstruction, or because Monte Carlo truth information shows they
contain no electrons of interest.

At the end of each job, the TrigSteerMonitor prints a table with the efﬁciency for each of the
algorithms in the sequence. The efﬁciencies are calculated with respect to reference electrons (as
deﬁned in the job options). Typically the efﬁciency could be calculated with respect to the Monte
Carlo electrons, to the LVL1 preselection or to ofﬂine reconstructed electrons, either separately or in
combination.

2

Moreover, as described in the section 3.1, a ﬁlter selection is applied at event generation level to
remove events with no chance of passing the level 1 trigger, and this has to be taken into account
when computing the total cross section.

2.2.1 Monte Carlo Preselection Cuts

For the signal samples (single electrons, W and Z decays), additional preselection cuts have been
applied on the electrons at the MonteCarlo truth level. These select only electrons that have their
momentun in a reasonable interval and that do not cross the crack region. The requirements are:

• one generated electron in each RoI,

• two RoIs per event (only for the Z events),

• Monte Carlo truth 5 < PT < 100 GeV

• |η| < 1.45 and |η| > 1.55, |η| < 2.45; these cuts exclude the crack region.

2.2.2 Ofﬂine Reconstructed Preselection Cuts

To compare the triggered electrons with the sample that would be reconstructed ofﬂine, the ofﬂine
selection algorithms are also run on all electron candidates. The ﬁrst two algorithms that are run
deﬁne as an ofﬂine electron any cluster-track match, and then set a series of bits in the IsEM ﬂag
variable. For all electron candidates, the candidate has to pass a series of cuts based on the shower
shape properties in different compartments of the calorimeter as well as variables combining ID and
calorimeter information. If a cut is not passed, then a corresponding veto bit is set in the isEM ﬂag.
For candidates with an associated track, identiﬁcation cuts based on the tracking information have to
be passed. Thus if isEM=0, then this is a good electron or photon.

2.2.3 LVL1 Preselection Cuts

The Level1 preselection algorithm simulates the decision of the LVL1 trigger, applying these cuts [3]:

• ClusterThreshold = 19.0 GeV (e25i) or 9.0 GeV (2e15i)

• EmRingIsolation = 3.0 GeV (e25i) or 8.0 GeV (2e15i)

• HadRingIsolation = 2.0 GeV (e25i) or 4.0 GeV (2e15i)

• HadCoreIsolation = 2.0 GeV (e25i) or 4.0 GeV (2e15i)

2.3 Datasets

Several different datasets were used to estimate the composition of the electron stream at low lumi-
nosity (1033cm−2s−1). We took samples generated and simulated for the ATLAS Physics Workshop,
in particular:

• Single electrons with ET = 25 GeV, generated with Pythia, about 1000 events

(dataset rome.004022.xxx Pt 25 Rome Production)

• Z → e+e− generated with Pythia, about 10000 events

(dataset rome.004201.recolum01.ZeeJimmy Rome Production)

• W → νee− generated with Pythia, about 10000 events

(dataset rome.004203.recolum01.WenuJimmy Rome Production)

• QCD di-jets generated with Pythia, about 138k events. This allows the evaluation of the trigger

background

.

3 Results

In this section the results after the trigger selection are shown. For each sample, the efﬁciency is
calculated at every step of the trigger chain. Both e25i and 2e15i are used. The trigger chains have
been run on the ESD samples used previously for the Rome Physics Workshop, the datasets deﬁned
in the section 2.3.

The following efﬁciencies are deﬁned with respect to both ofﬂine reconstructed electrons and
LVL1 conﬁrmation, as described in detail in section 2.2. The estimation of the rates have been
performed for low luminosity, using a MonteCarlo analysis on the CBNT rootples.

3.1 Preselection at Generation Level: Cross Section Used

An estimation of the expected trigger rate and composition of stream is given for low luminosity.
We calculated the event rate starting from the cross section (as derived from Pythia) and taking into
account the geometrical acceptance of the detector, considering only events that can be reconstructed.
In detail, the cross section of production at LHC of the events analyzed are reported in table 2, with
the ﬁlter efﬁciency:

• Electrons should have pT greater than 15 GeV and |η| < 3.0

• Two such leptons are required for Z events, and one for W events

To calculate the background trigger rates for electrons, we are using the Rome dataset 4814 for
dijets with ET(hard) = 15 GeV and a particle level ﬁlter cut of ET = 17 GeV. Each dataset contains
QCD di-jets as well as physics processes like W → νee−, Z → e+e− and direct photon production,
which have been added to the QCD jets according to their cross sections. The total cross section is
reported in table 2.

The rate is calculated using:

F ilter
where the ﬁlter takes into account the particle level ﬁlter applied at the generation level and reported
in table 2, while Nsel and Nall are the number of events selected by all the trigger chain and the total
number of events respectively.

are about 1000 single electrons of 25 GeV. The number of events after each preselection algorithm
are reported too.

3.2 Rates for Low Luminosity

The rates below have been computed using the TrigESDAnalysis package to estimate the efﬁciencies
and purities after each trigger algorithm (Athena Release 10.0.1, TrigESDAnalysis-00-00-05 tag), and
the MonteCarlo analysis using the CBNT Ntuples. Equation 1 has been used, with L = 1033cm2s−1
and the cross sections after the ﬁlter shown in table 2.

3.2.1

Single Electron

For reference, we have estimated the trigger efﬁciency for a sample of single electrons with ET = 25
GeV (e25i chain), with pile-up added.

The efﬁciency of preselection (including both LVL1 conﬁrmation and ofﬂine reconstruction isEM)
for this sample is about 84%. Table 3 reports the efﬁciencies of each algorithm with respect the pre-
vious one. These efﬁciencies are not cumulative.

Figure 1 shows the pT and energy distributions after the preselection cut isEM.

3.2.2 W → eνe

The sample W is selected applying the trigger chain: e25i. The electrons in the crack region have been
excluded and only one electron in each electromagnetic cluster is required too (Number of primary
electrons equal to one). The isEM ﬂag and the LVL1 conﬁrmation are then applied as preselection to
deﬁne the right sample of reference electrons. Table 4 shows the results for the W sample, compared
with the efﬁciencies derived from the 25 GeV single electron sample. The efﬁciencies are cumulative,
and calculated with respect to the electrons obtained after the preselection cuts.

The estimated rate after all selections, using the formula 1 and the cross section reported in table

2, is about 9.1 Hz at a luminosity of L = 1033cm−2s−1.

In ﬁgure 2, the pT distributions of the electrons from W decay after the preselection and the

complete e25i trigger chain are shown.

The comparison between the electromagnetic energy transverse for the single electrons and the
electrons from W decay is shown in the plot 4, this explains the different efﬁciency obtained for the
T2CaloHypo algorithm for these events. The efﬁciency as a function of pT of the electrons from W
decay is shown in ﬁgure 5.

The η distributions for single electrons after the Monte Carlo preselections are shown in ﬁgure 5.

been applied before the trigger chains, see section 2.2.1. The trigger steering uses two independent
selection chains, and the number of selected events is the algebraic union of the events selected by
the two chains. In the table 5, all the efﬁciencies are reported for each algorithm, and ﬁnally the total
efﬁciency of selection obtained by the sum of the e25i and 2e15i trigger chains. For each algorithm is
reported the number of selected events, an event is deﬁned “selected” with respect to the 2e15i chain
when there are two electrons per event while for the e25i chain when there are one or two electrons
per event.

The estimated rate using the formula 1 and the cross section after ﬁlter reported in table 2, is
about 0.84 Hz. The combined efﬁciency is obtained taking the events that are selected by e25i or
2e15i trigger chain and excluding double counting from events selected by both. It is interesting to
note that nearly all Z events are selected by the e25i trigger chain alone. The small fraction of electron
momenta betwen 15 and 25 GeV and the lower efﬁciency for selecting two electrons as compared to
one mean that the 2e15i trigger adds only a small number of events not selected by e25i, and 2e15i
alone has a signiﬁcantly lower efﬁciency for the overall sample.

3.2.4 QCD Di-jets

The selection of QCD events is done using the same hypothesis algorithms as for the signal sam-
ples, but without the requirement on the number of primary electrons in each cluster. The electron
candidates in this sample represent the background in the calibration stream with respect the other
physics events described above. Each dataset contains QCD di-jets as well as physics processes like
W → νee−, Z → e+e−, and direct photon production, so we analyzed in detail the Monte Carlo
composition of the stream to deﬁne what we obtain after the selection of the relevant physics pro-
cesses. Applying the cuts described above the expected rate is about 20 Hz, with an efﬁciency of 2.9
% with respect to the preselection and an efﬁciency of preselection of about 0.004 %.

The total number of analysed events total events is about 140000, and only 16 events survive all

the trigger cuts, with the following composition:

• Genuine electrons from W and Z or B hadron decays about 50%

• Converted photons from π or jets about 31%

The selected events in the background sample that contain genuine electrons can be considered as

useful for the electron calibration stream as well.

Figure 7 shows the rate of accepted events as a function of the energy of the triggered electron
candidate from the Calorimeter EF algorithm. Although the overall statistics are very low, it can be
seen that the electrons from W and Z boson decays have a somewhat softer ET spectrum than those
from the QCD background.

4 Different Selections

In this section we studied applying different cuts at the event ﬁlter to reduce the total electron stream
trigger rate to 10 Hz, keeping as large a fraction as possible of the pure electrons. The cuts applied at

Figure 6: Z → e+e− sample. The (a) plot shows the electron pT from MonteCarlo information (with
the constraint of RoI), while the (b) plot shows the eta distribution of the electrons from Z decay. The
electron pT distributions, after the trigger chains: 2e15i and e25i, are reported in the plots (c) and
(d) respectively.

the calorimeter ﬁlter level are not yet optimized, and possible improvements can be achieved modi-
fying the thresholds applied to the E/p ratio and track parameters. Figure 8 shows the E/p variable
for W signal and QCD background events in different η ranges. Again, although the statistics for the
background sample are very low, it looks possible to increase the signal purity by tightening the upper
cut on E/p.

In table 7, the effect of applying two different sets of cuts is shown on the rate of W and Z events
in comparison with the rate of QCD jets. Moreover for the QCD jets, the rate composition has been
analysed and the genuine electron component calculated.

Taking into account the last cuts, we can obtain about more than 17 Hz (Z+W+jet) trigger rate,
where about 15 Hz are genuine electrons useful for the electron calibration stream. The Z events are
less than 1 Hz after the cuts.

Figure 7: The plot shows the rates as function of electron energy after EF. The rates have been
obtained normalized the number of the entries with respect to the rate with 12 GeV per bin. The QCD
events are the dark histogram, the electrons are represented by the open histogram.

5 Conclusions and outlook

After this ﬁrst analysis on the Rome data sample using the Electron High Level Trigger chains (e25i
and 2e15i) we have estimated the electron trigger rate expected at low luminosity. The efﬁciency and
the purity have been calculated, with the standard thresholds and with modiﬁed cuts on the Event
Filter, to optimize as much as possible the ratio purity over efﬁciency of the obtained sample. After
some limited optimisation, a total rate of 17 Hz has been found, dominated by genuine electrons from
W and Z decay.

For the background, the number of selected events is very small, due to the limited size of the
available background sample. This makes it impossible to study further cut optimisation to reduce
the rate to the target of 10 Hz. However, it is already apparent that simply increasing the ET threshold,
while reducing the rate, will not increase the purity of the selected sample. Much more background
event statistics will be required to better understand the relations between the background composition
and the cuts on the E/p ratio.

More analysis will be performed on the CSC samples. In addition to looking at the e25i trig-
ger, it will be of interest to look at lower thresholds for lower luminosity running (e.g. 1031 and
1032cm−2s−1). This is not possible with the present background sample due to the ﬁlter cuts im-
posed in the event generation.

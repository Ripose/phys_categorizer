Abstract

Ultra-thin crystal targets in shape of self-supporting membranes were produced for our exper-
iments with parametric x-rays emitted by low-energy electrons. Concise description of the tech-
nology developed for production of silicon crystal membranes and the technique for the membrane
thickness measurements are considered in the paper. Membrane thickness of ∼0.5µm at 1.0mm
diameter supporting by 2×2 mm silicon substrate of ∼200µm thickness is achieved. Developed
technology for thin crystal membrane production can also be applied for manufacturing of various
membrane-containing sensors.

Experimental research with parametric x-rays emitting by non-relativistic electrons (NPXR) [1]
demands self-supporting crystal targets (membranes) of high perfection with thickness of 0.5micron
and below. Concise description of the technology for production of ultra-thin crystal membranes
developed for silicon and the technique for the membrane thickness measurements are considered in
the current paper.

Typical targets for NPXR generation were made as of 2×2 mm silicon substrate of ∼200 µm thick-
ness with crystal membrane of 1.0mm diameter and ∼0.5m thickness located inside this support. Base
planes have (100) or (111) orientations. For clarity development of (100) membranes are discussing
below.

Membrane material is the layer of un-doped epitaxial silicon of ∼0.9-1.0µm thickness grown on
substrate of boron doped p-type Si with 0.01Ohm·cm resistivity of KDB 0.01¡100¿ grade. Choice
of such structure was determined by applied electrochemical etching technique, in which un-doped
epitaxial Si serves as termination (or stop layer). To obtain membrane of other thickness one should
take structures with epitaxial layer thickness close to the desired one. Precise membrane thickness
adjustment can be performed by ion-beam etching with rate ∼10-15nm/min, but ion treatment for a
long time leads to the signiﬁcant membrane surface erosion.

To perform electrochemical etching we produce electrical contact to KDB 0.01 < 100 > through
high-resistive epitaxial Si layer from the planar side and reduce substrate thickness to ∼200µm. Sub-
strate thinning is performed by mechanical polishing. For contact manufacturing planar side is covered
by chemical resistant varnish with followed opening of the substrate peripheral region. Then the sub-
strate is etched in Si etchant to the epitaxial layer (∼1µm) depth (Fig. 1a).

After varnish stripping and appropriate chemical treatment, non-planar side is covered by SiO2of
about 0.3-0.4µm thickness, then Si3N4 of ∼0.15-0.2µm thickness, and at last Cr layer of ∼0.05µm
is vapor deposited to the better photoresist adhesion [2] (Fig.1b). Next step is the membrane pho-
tolithography on the non-planar wafer side. Electric contact to KDB 0.01 < 100 > is provided by

vapor deposition at ∼180◦ of ∼0.5µm aluminum ﬁlm through the mask to the substrate periphery,
Fig.1c.

The membrane etching is performed in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage we carry out electrochemical
porous anodic treatment in HF:2H5OH=4:1 electrolyte [3] during ∼120 minutes at ∼1.8µm/min rate.
Process is going until it reaches epitaxial Si at ∼200µm depth (Fig.1d). Finishing of porous silicon
formation one can observe at ∼10-20% potential jump. Additional etching during ∼10min is needed
for porous Si levelling along total substrate surface and also for membrane thinning down to ∼0.5µm.
Etching rate of high-resistive epitaxial Si is low, approximately 50nm/min.

In the second stage porous Si is etched in 1% KOH solution during 30minutes (Fig.1e). After
porous Si etching the substrate is extracted out of holder. Photoresist, Cr, and Al are stripped in
standard etchants. Dielectric (SiO2+Si3N4) ﬁlm is stripped by plasmachemical treatment.

Chipping is carried out by disk cutter while substrate is naphthalene glued on supporting Si wafer.
Finished crystals (Fig.1f) with membranes come out after naphthalene sublimation in the thermostat
at ∼110◦ temperature.

Final thickness of membranes is of the 0.4-0.9µm range. To get thinner membranes one should
apply ion-beam etching. Our experience shows that membranes with thickness below ∼0.2-0.3µm can
be hardly obtained in self-supporting mode due to its un-suﬃcient mechanical strength.

We have developed relatively simple technique to measure thickness of such ultra-thin Si targets.
As Si membranes with thickness of about micron and thinner are semi-transparent in the visible light,
one can record their optical transmittance spectra (example is in Fig.2, right panel). We can see
here interference maxima against background of a standard optical transmittance. After background
subtraction precise values of maxima locations can be measured (Fig.2, left panel).

Taking into consideration Si refraction index dispersion (it has about 10% variance in the visi-
ble region) and combining interference conditions for neighboring maxima one can obtain following
expression for thickness of a parallel-sided plate

d =

λiλi+1
2 (ni+1λi − niλi+1)

,

where n is the refraction index, λ is the wavelength in a maximum, i and (i + 1) identify values
belonging to adjoined interference maxima. Data on some measured samples took randomly of a
production lot are presented in the Table. Dispersion of measured thickness values of ﬁve targets took
randomly from one lot is below 5%.

Developed technology for thin crystal membrane production can also be applied for manufacturing
of various membrane-containing sensors, e.g. pressure meters, gas concentration and ﬂow sensors, as
well as other micro-mechanics items.

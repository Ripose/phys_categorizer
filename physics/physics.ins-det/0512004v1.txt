Moscow, RUSSIA
E-mail: danilov@itep.ru

Recent results on the particle detector R&D for new accelerators are reviewed. Diﬀerent approaches
for the muon systems, hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters, particle identiﬁcation devices, and
central trackers are discussed. Main emphasis is made on the detectors for the International Linear
Collider and Super B-factory. A detailed description of a novel photodetector, a so called Silicon
Photomultiplier, and its applications in scintillator detectors is presented.

1 Introduction

Particle detector R&D is a very active ﬁeld.
Impressive results of the long term R&D for
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are being
summarized now by the four LHC detector
collaborations. A worldwide eﬀort is shifted
to the detector development for the future In-
ternational Linear Collider (ILC) and for the
Super B-factory. The detector development
for the FAIR facility has already started.
Several groups perform R&D studies on de-
tectors for the next generation of the hadron
colliders.

This review is devoted mainly to the de-
tector development for the ILC and Super
B-factory. The vertex detectors are not dis-
cussed here in order to provide more details
in other ﬁelds. R&D on the vertex detectors
is very active and deserves a separate review.
This review is organized following the radius
of a typical collider detector from outside to
inside.

2 Muon Detectors

Muon detectors cover very large areas.
Therefore they should be robust and inexpen-
sive. Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) are of-
ten used in the present detectors, for exam-
ple at the B-factories. In the streamer mode
RPCs provide large signals. Hence it is pos-
sible to use very simple electronics. Another
advantage is a possibility to have diﬀerent

shapes of read out electrodes that match best
the physics requirements. For example the
BELLE RPCs have ring and sector shaped
readout electrodes in the end cap regions.

The European CaPiRe Collaboration de-
veloped a reliable industrial technique for the
glass RPC production1. The production rate
of more than 1000 square meters per day is
possible. The RPC eﬃciency is larger than
95% up to the counting rates of 1Hz/cm2.
This is reasonably adequate for the ILC de-
tector but at the Super-B factory one expects
by far larger rates. The RPCs in the propor-
tional mode can stand about hundred times
higher counting rates.

Scintillator strip detectors can work at
even higher rates. A very attractive possi-
bility is to use scintillator strips with Wave
Length Shifting (WLS) ﬁbers read out by so
called Silicon Photo Multipliers (SiPM).

SiPM is a novel photo detector devel-
oped in Russia2,3,4.
It will be mentioned
many times in this review. Therefore we
shall discuss its properties in detail a. SiPM
is a matrix of 1024 = 32

aThree groups developed such devices and produce
them. They use diﬀerent names for their products.
We will use a generic name SiPM for all types of mul-
tipixel Si diodes working in the Geiger mode. New
types of SiPMs are being developed by several groups
including Hamamatsu
bSiPMs can be produced with diﬀerent number of
pixels in the range 500-5000. We describe here the

1 mm2. Each diode has its own quench-
1
ing polysilicon resistor of the order of a few
hundred kΩ. All diode-resistor pairs, called
pixels later on, are connected in parallel.
A common reverse bias voltage Vbias is ap-
plied across them. Its magnitude of the or-
60V is high enough to start the
der of 40
Geiger discharge if any free charge carrier ap-
pears in the p
n junction depletion region.
The diode discharge current causes a volt-
age drop across the resistor. This reduces
the voltage across the diode below the break-
down voltage Vbreakdown and the avalanche
dies out. One diode signal
is Qpixel =
Vbreakdown) where Cpixel is the
Cpixel(Vbias
pixel capacitance. Typically Cpixel

and ∆V = Vbias
3V yielding
106 electrons. Such an ampliﬁca-
Qpixel
tion is similar to the one of a typical photo-
multiplier and 3–4 orders of magnitude larger
than the ampliﬁcation of an Avalanche Photo
Diode (APD) working in the proportional
mode. Qpixel does not depend on the number
of primary carriers which start the Geiger dis-
charge. Thus each diode detects the carriers
created e.g. by a photon, a charged parti-
cle or by a thermal noise with the same re-
106 electrons. Moreover
sponse signal of
the characteristics of diﬀerent diodes inside
the SiPM are also very similar. When ﬁred,
they produce approximately the same signals.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1a.
It shows the
SiPM response spectrum when it is illumi-
nated by weak ﬂashes of a Light Emitting
Diode (LED). First peak in this ﬁgure is the
pedestal. The second one is the SiPM re-
sponse when it detects exactly one photon.
It is not known which diode inside the SiPM
produces the signal since all of them are con-
nected to the same output. However since the
responses of all pixels are similar, the peak
width is small. If several pixels in the SiPM
are ﬁred, the net charge signal is the sum of
all charges. The third, forth and so on peaks

around zero belong to the pedestal.

The SiPM photodetection eﬃciency de-
pends on the light wave length and the over-
voltage ∆V . A typical value is about 10-15%
for the green light.
It includes geometrical
ineﬃciency due to dead regions in the SiPM
between the pixels. Thus SiPM and tradi-
tional photomultipliers have similar gain and
eﬃciency. However, SiPM is approximately
twice cheaper than one channel in the mul-
tianode photomultiplier and further cost re-
ductions are expected in case of mass produc-
tion. SiPM can work in the magnetic ﬁeld,
so there is no need in the light transporta-
tion out of the magnetic ﬁeld. SiPM is so
tiny that it can be mounted directly on the
detector. This minimizes the light losses be-
cause of a shorter ﬁber length. SiPM has a
quite high noise rate of about 2 MHz at 0.1
photoelectron threshold. However the noise
rate drops fast with increasing threshold.

for cosmic particles obtained with the scintil-
lator strip detector read out by two SiPMs 6.

1 cm3
The detector consists of a 200
plastic scintillator strip and a wavelength
shifting ﬁber read out by two SiPMs installed
at the strip ends. The strip is extruded from
the granulated polystyrene with two dyes at
the “Uniplast” enterprise in Vladimir, Rus-
sia. The Kuraray multicladding WLS ﬁber
Y11 (200) with 1 mm diameter is put in the
2.5 mm deep groove in the middle of the strip.
No gluing is used to attach the WLS ﬁber
to the SiPM or to the strip. There is about
200 µm air gap between the ﬁber end and
the SiPM. To improve the light collection ef-
ﬁciency, the strip is wrapped in the Superra-
diant VN2000 foil produced by the 3M com-
pany.

In the worst case when the particle passes
through the strip center there are 13.7 de-
tected photons. The Minimum Ionizing Par-
ticle (MIP) signal in Fig. 1b is well separated
from the pedestal. The detector eﬃciency
averaged over the strip length is as high as
0.3% at the 8 pixel threshold. Such
99.3
a threshold is suﬃcient to reduce the SiPM
noise rate to 5kHz.

The ITEP group has also studied 100

1 cm3 strips 7 with a SiPM 3 at one end
4
of the WLS ﬁber and a 3M Superradiant foil
mirror at the other end. The strips were pro-
duced by the extrusion technique in Kharkov.
The strip surface was covered by a Ti oxide
reﬂector co-extruded together with the strip.
The Kuraray Y11, 1mm diameter ﬁber was
glued into the 3mm deep groove with an op-
tical glue. SiPM was also glued to the ﬁber.
More than 13 photoelectrons per MIP were
detected at the strip end far from the SiPM.
With such a large number of photoelectrons
the eﬃciency of more than 99% for MIP was
obtained with the threshold of 7 photoelec-
trons. The detector can work at counting
rates above 1kHz/cm2. This is suﬃcient for
the Super B-factory. Therefore the Belle Col-
laboration plans to use this technique for the
KL and muon system upgrade in the end cap
region 8.

A scintillator tile structure can be used
1 cm3
for even higher rates. Sixteen 10
tiles read out by two SiPM 3 each were tested
at the KEK B-factory 8. They demonstrated
a stable performance adequate for the Su-
per B-factory. An eight square meter cos-
mic test system for ALICE TOF RPC cham-
bers is constructed at ITEP 9.
It consists
1 cm3 tiles read out by two
of 15
SiPMs 3 each. The counters have an intrinsic
noise rate below 0.01 Hz, the time resolution
of 1.2 nsec, and the rate capabilities up to
10 kHz/cm2.

3 Hadronic Calorimeters

The precision physics program at the fu-
ture International Linear Collider (ILC) re-
quires to reconstruct heavy bosons (W,Z,H)
in hadronic ﬁnal states in multijet events. In
order to do this a jet energy resolution of bet-
ter than 30%/√E is required 10. The en-
ergy E is measured in GeV in this expres-
sion and in similar expressions for the en-
ergy resolution below. Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations demonstrate that such a resolu-
tion can be achieved using a novel ”particle
ﬂow” (PF) approach in which each particle in
a jet is measured individually 11. Momenta
of charged particles are determined using
tracker information. Photons are measured
in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).
Only neutrons and KL should be measured
in the Hadronic calorimeter (HCAL). They
carry on average only about 12% of the jet
energy. Therefore the HCAL can have mod-
est energy resolution. The major problem is
to reconstruct showers produced by charged
tracks and to remove the corresponding en-
ergy from the calorimetric measurements.
This requirement makes the pattern recog-
nition ability to be a major optimization pa-
rameter of HCAL.

The CALICE Collaboration investigates
two approaches for the HCAL. In the dig-
ital approach only one bit yes/no informa-

tion is recorded for each cell. Extremely high
granularity of about 1 cm2/cell is required in
this case. In the analog approach the pulse
height information is recorded for each cell.
However a very high granularity of about
5 cm2/cell is still required 12. Such a
5
granularity practically can not be achieved
with a conventional readout approach with
WLS ﬁber and a multianode photomultiplier
(MAPM). The use of tiny SiPMs makes such
a granularity achievable.

3.1 Analog Hadronic Calorimeters

A small 108 channel hadronic calorimeter
prototype has been built in order to gain ex-
perience with this novel technique 5. The
calorimeter active modules have been made
at ITEP and MEPhI. Scintillator tiles are
made of a cheap Russian scintillator using a
molding technique. A Kuraray Y11 1mm di-
ameter double clad WLS ﬁber is inserted into
a 2mm deep circular groove without gluing.
The SiPM is placed directly on the tile and
occupies less than 0.5% of a sensitive area.
There is an air gap of about 100µm between
the ﬁber and SiPM. Signals from SiPMs are
sent directly to LeCroy 2249A ADCs via 25
meter long 50 Ω cables.

A lot of R&D has been performed in or-
der to increase the light yield and the unifor-
mity of the response. For better light collec-
tion the surface of the tiles is covered with 3M
Superradiant foil. The tile edges are chemi-
cally treated in order to provide diﬀuse light
reﬂection and separation between tiles. A
light yield of more than 20 photoelectrons per
0.5 cm3
MIP has been achieved for 5
tiles. Fig. 2 shows LED and β-source (90Sr)
signals from such a tile. Peaks with diﬀer-
ent number of photoelectrons are clearly seen.
Signals from the β-source are very similar to
MIP signals.

two measurements is better than 2%. The
linear behavior of the SiPM result (better
than 2%) demonstrates that the applied sat-
uration correction due to limited number of
pixels in the SiPM is reliable. The obtained
energy resolution agrees well with MC expec-
tations and with a resolution obtained using
conventional MAPMs as well as APDs 13.
The obtained resolution of about 21%/√E
is modest since this is a hadron calorimeter.

3.2 Digital Hadronic Calorimeters

The RPC based digital HCAL is developed
by a subgroup of the CALICE collabora-
tion 16. They studied several RPC geometries
and gases in order to optimize the eﬃciency
and to reduce the cross-talk between pads.
Fig. 4 shows the eﬃciency and pad multiplic-
ity due to cross-talk obtained with the devel-
oped RPC prototype. The prototype consists
of two sheets of ﬂoating glass with the resis-
tive paint layer (1Mohm/square) and the gas
gap of 1.2 mm. In works in the proportional
mode and has the eﬃciency above 90% up to
the rates of 50 Hz/cm2. The pad multiplicity
is about 1.5. Much smaller pad multiplicity
is observed in the RPC in which the readout
electrode deﬁnes the gas sensitive volume in-
stead of the glass sheet (see Fig. 4). It will
be interesting to study further the properties
of this promising RPC.

The GEM based digital HCAL is studied
by another subgroup of the CALICE Collabo-
ration 17. They developed a procedure for the
large area double GEM chamber production.
A small prototype demonstrates the 95% ef-
ﬁciency at 40mV threshold and the pad mul-
tiplicity of 1.27. The 3M company plans to
produce already in 2005 very long GEM foils
of about 30 cm width.

The number of channels in the digital
HCAL is enormous. Therefore cheap and re-
liable electronics is the key issue for this ap-
proach. The RPC and GEM digital HCAL
teams develop jointly the electronics suitable

ciency for two types of RPC: full circles - standard

for both techniques.

3.3 The DREAM Calorimeter

Usually calorimeters have diﬀerent response
to electromagnetic and hadronic showers of
the same energy. Therefore the ﬂuctuations
of the electromagnetic energy fraction in the
hadron shower is one of the main reasons for
the deterioration of the energy resolution.

In the Dual Readout Module (DREAM)
calorimeter 18 the electromagnetic energy in
the hadronic shower is measured indepen-
dently using quartz ﬁbers sensitive only to
the Cherenkov light produced dominantly by
electrons. The visible energy is measured
by scintillation ﬁbers. The electromagnetic
energy fraction in the shower can be deter-
mined by the comparison of the two mea-
surements. This allows to correct for the
diﬀerent calorimeter response to the electro-
magnetic showers and to improve the en-
ergy resolution. A very similar response to
electrons, hadrons, and jets was obtained in
the DREAM calorimeter prototype after this
correction. The ultimate energy resolution
of the DREAM calorimeter is expected to
be better than 30%/√E. Unfortunately the

For Publisher’s use

shower leakage and insuﬃcient amount of the
Cherenkov light limited the measured proto-
type calorimeter resolution to 64%/√E only.
The ﬂuctuations of the visible energy be-
cause of the nuclear energy loss can be cor-
rected for by adding to the DREAM structure
the third type of ﬁbers sensitive to neutrons.
In this case the ultimate energy resolution of
15%/√E is expected 18. There are many nice
ideas how to separate diﬀerent mechanisms in
the hadronic shower and to improve the en-
ergy resolution 18. However they should be
ﬁrst demonstrated experimentally.

The CALICE collaboration constructs
the Si/W prototype with about 10 thousand
channels 19. The pad size is as small as
1 cm2. The Si thickness is 500µm. The
1
tungsten plate thickness is 1.4 mm, 2.8 mm,
and 4.2 mm in the front, middle, and rare
parts of the calorimeter. One third of the
prototype has already been tested at the
DESY electron beam and demonstrated a
stable behavior. The signal to noise ratio
of 8.5 was obtained for MIP. The tests of
the whole calorimeter will start this Winter.
The combined tests with the analog hadronic
calorimeter are planned in 2006 as well.

The detector and readout plane thickness
is 3.4 mm in the present prototype.
It will
be reduced to 1.75 mm including the readout
chip in the ﬁnal design resulting in RM =
1.4 cm.

The US groups (SLAC, UO, BNL) de-
velop even more aggressive design of the
Si/W calorimeter 20 for the small radius Si
based ILC detector (ILC SiD). The detec-
tor and readout plane thickness is 1 mm only
which results in the RM = 1.4 cm. Together
with HPK they developed the Si detector
consisting of 1024 hexagonal pads with 5 mm
inner diameter. The detector is read out by
a specially developed electronic chip 21. The
measured MIP signal in this detector is 26k
electrons while the pedestal width is 780 elec-
trons. The Si/W calorimeter for ILC is also
developed in Korea 22.

A hybrid scintillator/lead calorimeter
prototype with three Si layers has been built

0.3 cm3 scintillator tiles are com-
5
bined into 4 longitudinal sections. Three lay-
9mm2 Si pads are placed between
ers of 9
the sections at 2, 6, and 12X0. The proto-
type demonstrated a good energy resolution
of 11.1%/√E. It has the impressive spatial
resolution of 2mm at 30GeV and e/π rejec-
tion below 10−3. However it is not clear
whether the granularity is suﬃcient for the
PF method. Also the light transportation in
the real detector will be extremely diﬃcult.
The use of SiPMs can solve the last problem.

4.2 Electromagnetic Calorimeters for

the Super B-Factory

Electromagnetic calorimeters for the Super
B-factory should have a very good energy res-

olution and a fast response. They should be
radiation hard up to about 10 kRad in the
endcap region. The present CsI(Tl) calorime-
ters at the KEKB and SLAC B-factories can
not stand the planned increase of the lumi-
nosity above 20ab−1. The CsI(Tl) light yield
decreases to about 60% already at 10ab−1.
There is also a large increase of PIN diode
dark current. Finally the long decay time of
about 1 µsec leads to the pile up noise and
fake clusters.

The BELLE Collaboration proposes to
use pure CsI crystals with a phototetrode
readout and a waveform analysis in the end
cap region 25. The shaping time is reduced
from 1 µsec to 30 nsec. The time resolution
of better than 1 nsec is achieved for energies
above 25 M eV . The electronic noise is simi-
lar to the present CsI(Tl) calorimeters. The
pure CsI crystals keep more than 90% of the
light output after the irradiation of 7 kRad.
The BaBar Collaboration considers more
radiation hard options of LSO or LYSO crys-
tals and a liquid Xe calorimeter with the light
readout 26. The LSO and LYSO crystals
are radiation hard, fast, and dense (see Ta-
ble 1). They meet perfectly the requirements
of the Super B-factory but their cost is pro-
hibitively high at the moment. Liquid Xe is
also an attractive option as it is seen in Ta-
ble 1. The challenge here is the UV light col-
lection. BaBar proposes to use WLS ﬁbers
and WLS cell coating for an immediate shift
of the light wave length into a region with
smaller absorption.

There is a good experience with very
large liquid noble gas calorimeters. For ex-
ample the 11 m3 LiKr calorimeter at VEPP-4
has an excellent spatial (

tance test which included a 500 krad irradi-
ation and accelerated aging. Vacuum pho-
totriodes (RIA, St.Petersburg) will be used
in the endcaps because they are more radia-
tion hard. The main challenge for CMS is to
ﬁnish the production of crystals and to main-
tain the advantages of this approach in the

A novel type of proximity focusing RICH
counter with a multiple refractive index (n)

For Publisher’s use

aerogel radiator has been developed for the
BELLE detector upgrade 29. The multiple
radiator allows to increase the radiator thick-
ness and hence the Cherenkov photon yield
without degradation in single photon angular
resolution. With the refractive index of the
consecutive layers suitably increasing in the
downstream direction (focusing combination)
one can achieve overlapping of Cherenkov
rings from all layers (see Fig. 5). With the de-
creasing n (defocusing combination) one can
obtain well separated rings from diﬀerent lay-
ers (see Fig. 6).

Fig. 7 shows the performance of the de-
tector with the single and multiple layer ra-
diators. The number of detected photons is
similar in two approaches but the single pho-
ton resolution is much better in the multi-
ple layer conﬁguration. The Cherenkov angle
resolution of 4.5 mrad per track was achieved
with the triple layer radiator. This corre-
sponds to the 5.1σ K/π separation at 4GeV .
The radiators with diﬀerent refraction in-
dex layers attached directly at the molecular
level have been produced at Novosibirsk 30
and in Japan 29.

5.2 TOF systems

A multilayer RPC (MRPC) with the excel-
lent time resolution of better than 50 psec
(see Fig.9) has been developed for the AL-
ICE TOF system 32. It has the eﬃciency of
about 99% at the counting rates as high as
few hundred Hz/cm2. The MRPC has ten
220 µm gaps. It would be interesting to in-
vestigate a possibility to use MRPC for KL
momentum measurements in the muon sys-
tem at the Super B-factory.

nique for the Super B-factory. The SLAC
and Cincinnati groups develop the Fast Fo-
cusing DIRC (FDIRC) detector 26. The
idea of this detector is illustrated in Fig. 8.
With the accurate time measurement one
gets a 3D image of the Cherenkov cone.
In FDIRC the photon detection part is by
far smaller than in DIRC. The development
of the pixelated photodetectors with better
than 100 nsec time resolution is a challeng-
ing task. The detail studies of Hamamatsu
MAPM and Burley MCP PM at SLAC give
very promising results. The FDIRC proto-
type is ready for tests at SLAC.

Figure 8. The principle of FDIRC operation.

In the Time of Propagation (TOP)
counter the Cherenkov cone image is recon-
structed from the coordinate at the quartz
bar end and the TOP 31. The MCP PM SL10
is developed for TOP together with HPK.
SL10 has 5 mm pitch and a single photon
sensitivity in the 1.5T magnetic ﬁeld. The
time resolution of 30 psec has been achieved
however the cross-talk is still a problem. The
Ga/As photocathodes developed by HPK
and Novosibirsk provide enough light for the
4σ π/K separation at 4 GeV . However the
cathode life time is not suﬃcient yet.
It
looses 40% of quantum eﬃciency after col-
lecting 350 mC/cm2 which corresponds to 6
month operation at the Super B-factory.

with a 3
3 mm2 SiPM with-
read out directly by a 3
out preampliﬁer 33. The MIPs were crossing
40 mm in the scintillator. Therefore the sig-
nal was as big as 2700 pixels in the SiPM
with 5625 pixels. The threshold was at 100
pixels. This approach is very promising for a
super high granularity TOF capable to work
in a very high intensity beams for example at
FAIR.

The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is a
natural choice for the ILC detector central
tracker. This approach is developed by a

equipped with a low noise preampliﬁer, dis-
criminator, threshold DAC and communica-
tion logic. The extremely high granularity
allows to distinguish individual clusters in a
track. Thus the ultimate spatial and dE/dx
resolution can be achieved. Unfortunately
the diﬀusion will severely limit both mea-
surements. Nice tracks have been recorded
by a prototype chamber equipped with Mi-
cromegas and MediPix2 (see Fig. 11). The
number of observed clusters (0.52/mm in a
He/Isobutane 80/20 mixture) agrees within
15% with the expectations. The next step
is to integrate the chip and Micromegas at
the postprocessing step and to add the (drift)
time measurement. Tracks were observed
also with a GEM/MediPix2 prototype 36. A

vides continues tracking through a large vol-
ume with a very small amount of material in
front of the ECAL (X0
3% in the barrel re-
gion). The dE/dx resolution of better than
5% helps in particle identiﬁcation.

The thrust of the R&D is in the de-
velopment of novel micro-pattern gas detec-
tors which promise to have a better point
and two track resolution than the traditional
wire chambers. These detectors have smaller
ion feedback into the TPC volume. Mi-
cromegas meshes and GEM foils are consid-
ered as main candidates. The spatial resolu-
tion of
100 µm was already achieved with
GEM after the 65 cm drift in the 4 T ﬁeld (see
Fig. 10). Tests at smaller ﬁelds demonstrate
that a similar resolution can be achieved with
Micromegas as well. The double track reso-
2mm has been already demon-
lution of
strated in small prototypes. By pitting a re-
sistive foil above the readout pads it is pos-
sible to spread the signal over several pads.
As a result the resolution improves up to the
diﬀusion limit.

compact all Si tracker is vigorously developed
by the US groups 35 for the small radius Si
Detector for ILC. With small detector mod-
ules it is possible to reach a very good S/N
ratio of about 20, to have a simple low risk
assembly and relatively small amount of ma-
0.8% X0 per layer including a sup-
terial of
port structure. The pattern recognition is a
serious issue for the Si tracker especially for
tracks not coming from the main vertex.

In the BaBar study 37 the luminosity
term in the background extrapolation dom-
inates. Therefore the background estimates
are much higher than in the BELLE case. A
drift chamber can not work in such environ-
ment. Therefore it is proposed to use the
all Si tracker up to R = 60 cm. A relatively
large amount of material in the Si sensors and
support structures leads to multiple scatter-
ing and considerable deterioration of the mo-
mentum and mass resolution. For example
π+π− decay
the mass resolution in the B
mode deteriorates from 23M eV in case of the
drift chamber to 35M eV in case of a conser-
vative Si tracker design. Serious R&D eﬀorts
are required to make the Si tracker thinner. It
should be also demonstrated that the pattern
recognition in the Si tracker is good enough.
May be it is possible to develop an al-
ternative solution to the Si tracker. Us-
ing the controlled etching the BINP-CERN
group reduced the Cu thickness in GEM foils
from 5 to 1µm 38. This allows to build
the light triple GEM chamber with less than
0.15% X0 including the readout electrode.
The light double GEM chamber has even
smaller thickness. The double and triple light
GEM chambers were constructed and demon-
strated identical performance with the stan-
dard GEM chambers. The light GEM cham-
bers have a potential to provide the granu-
larity and spatial resolution comparable to
the Si tracker but with considerably smaller
amount of material. However it is not clear so
far how thick a support structure is needed.
A lot of R&D studies are required to demon-

strate a feasibility of this approach.

7 Conclusions

The ongoing R&D should be suﬃcient to
demonstrate the feasibility of detectors for
the ILC and the Super B-factory. However
there are many promising new ideas which
have a potential to improve considerably the
performance of the detectors and to exploit
fully the physics potential of these colliders.
The technologies for practically all detector
subsystems are still to be selected on the ba-
sis of the R&D results. It is very important
to strengthen and to focus the detector R&D
especially for the ILC as it was done for the
LHC collider.

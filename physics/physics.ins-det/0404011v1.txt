Abstract

The HADES dielectron spectrometer has recently launched its physics program at
the heavy ion synchrotron SIS at GSI Darmstadt. The spectroscopy of vector mesons
in heavy ion collisions via their dielectron decay channel makes great demands
on the HADES tracking system regarding acceptance and spatial resolution. The
tracking system is formed out of 24 low-mass, trapezoidal multi-layer drift chambers
providing about 30 m2 of active area. Low multiple scattering in the in total four
planes of drift chambers before and after the magnetic ﬁeld is ensured by using
helium-based gas mixtures and aluminum cathode and ﬁeld wires. First in-beam
performance results are contrasted with expectations from simulations. Emphasis
is placed on the energy loss information, exploring its relevance regarding track
recognition.

1 Introduction

The HADES dielectron spectrometer [1] at the heavy ion synchrotron SIS at GSI
Darmstadt has taken up its physics program in several beam time campaigns, start-
ing late 2001, focusing on C+C reactions at 1 and 2 AGeV incident energy. Recently,
a beam time studying p+p reactions in the same energy regime has been success-
fully conducted.
The spectroscopy of vector mesons in heavy ion collisions via their dielectron de-
cay channel deﬁnes the decisive design and performance constraints on the HADES
tracking system. An intrinsic spatial cell resolution of better than 140 µm along with
the reduction of multiple scattering in detector materials and gas, high eﬃciency and
a large acceptance are crucial requirements for the success of the experimental pro-
gram. Extended design studies and prototyping [2,3] preceded the production of the
24 drift chambers of four diﬀerent sizes, conducted by GSI Darmstadt, LHE/JINR
Dubna, FZ Rossendorf [4], IPN Orsay and University of Frankfurt.
Presently 22 chambers are in-place and do already now allow for high-precision
tracking in two-third of the full azimuth. In the following the tracking system and
its design parameters are introduced. Then, ﬁrst results are brieﬂy reviewed, high-
lighting data on the capability of the drift chamber energy loss signal regarding
track matching, and particle identiﬁcation in general.

2 The HADES drift chambers

2.1 Detector characteristics

The HADES tracking system consists of 24 trapezoidal, planar multi-layer drift
chambers (MDC) symmetrically arranged in six identical sectors. It provides a
polar angles coverage between 18 and 85 degrees around the beam axis, forming
four tracking planes (I-IV) of increasing size. In each sector, two chambers (plane
I and II) are located in front of and two (plane III and IV) behind the toroidal
magnetic ﬁeld of the super-conducting magnet, as shown in ﬁgure 1. To cope with
ambiguities in track reconstruction in the high multiplicity environment of a heavy
ion reaction (for central Au+Au collisions at 1 AGeV incident energy a maximum
cell occupancy of 30% is estimated), all chambers are composed of six sense/ﬁeld
wire layers oriented in ﬁve diﬀerent stereo angles. This allows for maximum spatial
resolution in polar direction, which points in the direction of the momentum kick.
All four chamber types contain about 1100 drift cells each, with increasing size
from 5x5 mm2 (plane I) to 14x10 mm2 (plane IV). The chambers provide active
areas from 0.35 m2 up to 3.2 m2, thus covering the same solid angle per sector,
respectively. The main feature of the design and the operation parameters of the
chambers is the consequent implementation of the low-mass concept, as result of
the R&D phase [2]. To meet these requirements (i) cathode and ﬁeld wires are
made of annealed aluminum (plane I-III: bare, IV: gold-plated) with 80 µm and

2

100 µm diameter, and with initial tensions between 80 and 150 cN, depending on
the chamber type. In addition, (ii) helium-based counting gas (helium:isobutane =
60:40) is used. The entrance windows are made of 12 µm aluminized mylar. The
20 µm (planes I-III) and 30 µm (plane IV) thick gold-plated tungsten sense wires
are strained with an initial tension of 40 and 50 cN, respectively. To compensate
for the total wire tension after being released from the assembly table, all chamber
frames have been pre-stressed before wire gluing. Together with the requirements
concerning the acceptance this resulted in a sophisticated layer frame design with
only 3 cm width for the inner-most chambers. The total detector thickness per
chamber in units of radiation length is below 5x10−4 and hence low multiple
scattering guarantees the momentum resolution needed to accomplish the physics
demands.

2.2 Long-term stability

The experiments with HADES are expected to run at least ten years. Creeping of
the aluminum wires and ageing are the main concerns with respect to the long-
term stability of the chambers. Creeping has been systematically investigated in
tension loss test series, yielding a 10% loss in tension within ﬁve years. This has
been conﬁrmed by remeasurements in one chamber of plane III [4]. Ageing is mainly
caused by the accumulated dose in combination with the materials used for con-
struction and operating the chambers. For example, epoxy from Araldite is used for
gluing the wires on the frames from Stesalit. The gas system is running in a re-ﬂow
mode with typically 10 % fresh gas and continuous puriﬁcation. The drift velocity
monitors [5] provide a very sensitive control of the gas quality by measuring the
drift velocity with a precision of better than 0.2 %. In addition, the simultaneous
monitoring of the relative gains allows for conclusions on the gas contamination,
e.g. due to oxygen. The expected maximum dose is in the order of 10 mC per year
and centimeter of the sense wire. An accelerated ageing test with 55Fe using two
prototype chambers exhibited no noticeable gain drop (<5%) for a time period of
two years of running [2].
These R&D results on creeping and ageing, together with the careful selection of
materials and running conditions, suggest that the projected long-term operation
of the HADES tracking system can be kept.

2.3 Read-out electronics

The drift chamber signals are read-out and digitized at the chamber, not extending
into its active area. Hence, special emphasis was put on the integration of the
modular front-end electronics, realized with analog boards (16 channels) mounted
on digitization boards (64 or 96 channels). Four sense wires are connected by ﬂexible
printed circuits to the analog boards [8], housing ASD8-B chips [9] (8 channels,
1 fC intrinsic noise, 30 mW/ch, adjustable threshold) for diﬀerential ampliﬁcation,

3

shaping and discrimination. These chips deliver logical signals with variable width,
equivalent to the time the shaped signal exceeds the given threshold. The logical
signals are fed to TDC chips (CMOS, 8 channels/chip, 0.5 ns/ch, common-stop,
1 µs full range, making use of a ring oscillator) on the digitization boards. This
semi-customized ASIC is multi-hit capable and thus allows to detect also the time-
above-threshold of each hit. Besides spike and zero suppression this chip oﬀers
the possibility of internal calibration, activated by a separate trigger type. The
design of the front-end electronics was decisively inﬂuenced by minimizing the noise
level on-line. In addition, the time-above-threshold information is a valuable tool to
discriminate remaining noise hits oﬀ-line.

3 Results

3.1 Performance

The chambers have been running in several C+C and p+p experiments with mod-
erate intensity and occupancy. Layer detection eﬃciencies around 98 % have been
deduced. The average spatial resolutions of a drift cell can be determined with data
by means of a self-tracking method and is between 100 and 130 µm, comprising
contributions from calibration accuracy and electronic noise. This is well below
the design value of 140 µm, see ﬁgure 2. Under clean conditions, with 2.1 GeV/c
protons impinging on a prototype, using a silicon-strip tracker as reference and
standard read-out electronics, intrinsic spatial resolutions around 70 µm have been
reached [3], similar to results given by GARFIELD simulations. Preliminary simu-
lation studies on the expected track spatial resolution in a segment of two adjacent
chambers yield values below 60 µm (modules of plane I and II) in direction of the
momentum kick, made possible by the multiple position measurement per segment,
see ﬁgure 3. These simulations have been conﬁrmed by experimental results from
tracking, suggesting an error in measuring the angle of a segment in the polar di-
rection of about 0.2 mrad.

3.2 Energy loss and tracking

Besides the arrival time of the electrons the time-above-threshold ∆t of the corre-
sponding signal is measured for each cell hit. From the latter value the energy loss
can be deduced. ∆t is a measure of the number of produced primary electron clus-
ters [7], i.e. the energy loss of a particle traversing the drift cell. It is determined by
the ionization density of the particle, and the track topology in a given cell, which
is characterized by the impact angle and the impact parameter relative to the sense
wire. The energy loss along a track (segment) can be used to resolve ambiguities
in matching track segments from the inner and outer chambers, to support the
particle identiﬁcation by adding complementary information, and to reject tracks

originating from conversion and Dalitz decays with small opening angles - the main
background in dielectron spectroscopy.
To investigate the resolution of the energy loss signal, eﬀects from the topology of
the track as well as of the electron drift inside a cell have to be corrected for. These
topological eﬀects can be corrected by using the local information on the orienta-
tion and position of the track segment, deﬁned by two adjacent chambers in one
sector, respectively. Here, GARFIELD simulations on time-to-distance relations in
diﬀerent cell geometries are employed. Simulation results and measured data coin-
cide to a high degree [7]. Eﬀects of the electron drift topology on the energy loss
signal have been systematically parameterized based on data only, and are used for
normalization. As a result, the normalized ∆t can be plotted as a function of the
measured momentum, shown in ﬁgure 4. Clearly, the separation of pions and pro-
tons at low momenta can be seen. Electrons cannot be distinguished from pions. The
achieved resolution (σ) of the normalized ∆t so far is about 7 % (protons) and 12 %
(pions), possible improvements are currently under investigation. However, these
results provide already now conﬁdence in the analysis power of the MDC’s energy
loss information, although the chamber design has originally not been optimized in
this respect.

4 Conclusions

The low-mass HADES tracking system is operational and the performance is accord-
ing to its design values, thus allowing for high-resolution dielectron spectroscopy.
Currently, scenarios are under debate on the possibility to include the hit informa-
tion of the chambers in a higher level trigger. The energy loss signal measured for
each track turned out to be a valuable tool to improve on resolving ambiguities in
tracking and on background reduction, even though the chamber design has been
optimized for minimizing the detector thickness.

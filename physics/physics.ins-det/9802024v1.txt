Abstract

We describe a start-timing detector for the PHENIX experiment at the rela-
tivistic heavy-ion collider RHIC. The role of the detector is to detect a nuclear
collision, provide precise time information with an accuracy of 50ps, and de-
termine the collision point along the beam direction with a resolution of a few
cm. Technical challenges are that the detector must be operational in a wide
particle-multiplicity range in a high radiation environment and a strong mag-
netic ﬁeld. We present the performance of the prototype and discuss the ﬁnal
design of the detector.

1 Introduction

The PHENIX (Pioneering High Energy Nuclear and Ion eXperiment) spectrome-
ter [1] of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (hereafter abbreviated as RHIC) at
the Brookhaven National Laboratory is now under construction. Phenix is com-
posed of various sub-detectors for hadron-, lepton- and photon-measurements in ultra-
relativistic heavy nucleus-nucleus collisions at √s=200 GeV/c per nucleon, as well
as in proton on proton reactions at √s=500 GeV/c. For particle identiﬁcation of
interesting species and background rejection, time-of-ﬂight (hereafter abbreviated as
TOF) measurements are the crucial function. The RHIC beam bunches have a large
longitudinal dimension, which is expected to be about 25cm rms in the present accel-
erator design. It turns out that a nuclear collision could happen at any place in the
colliding region and at any moment during the beam bunch crossing, which continues
for about 2ns. For precise TOF measurements with detectors providing stop timing
signals with 100ps resolution, we have to determine the start time very accurately.
A detector sub-system to measure the start timing is named Beam/Beam Counter
(abbreviated as BBC hereafter) in PHENIX.

A pair of BBC will detect secondary particles from every collision at very forward
angles between 2.4◦ and 5.7◦ in the north- and south-ends of the central spectrometer
along the beam axis. Each measures the arrival time of a leading charged particle,
which travels at nearly the speed of light. An average and a diﬀerence between time
measured at each end provide the start time measured from a common clock and the
longitudinal vertex position along the beam axis, respectively. The vertex position
will be employed in the ﬁrst level trigger to clean up events and as a starting point
for further online tracking analysis.

We have completed design studies of the BBC consisting of an array of 64 identical
detector elements at each end. We have tested prototype detector elements with pion
beams, studied performance of a small array of the prototypes in heavy-ion collisions
at 15 GeV/c per nucleon, and have recently carried out quality assurance tests with
the detector elements of the production phase.

In section 2, we describe requirements, conceptual design and the technological
choice for the detector. Results from a series of beam tests with the prototypes are
given in section 3. In section 4, we discuss on our technological choice and optimiza-
tion. We also demonstrate the start time determination with multiple measurements
of reaction products from nuclear collisions and show the results from the QA tests.
A summary is given in section 5.

2 Design of Detector Element and Array

Fig. 1 shows a cut-away view of the PHENIX spectrometer. The BBC is positioned
between the central spectrometer magnet and the muon sub-detector, and covers a
pseudo-rapidity region from 3.0 to 3.9 over full azimuth. Another identical set is
installed in the opposite side. Secondary particles emitted in this kinematical region
pass through an axial hole of the main spectrometer magnet and go into the BBC.

2

All the strongly interacting particles will be ﬁnally absorbed in the piston magnet
placed immediately behind the BBC.

The BBC must satisfy the following requirements: It has to primarily provide a
precise time information of each collision in various environments of particle multi-
plicity. In case of p+p reactions, one would expect only a few charged particles in this
acceptance. For a nuclear collision such as a central Au+Au collision, however, one
would expect more than 1,000 charged particles hitting the BBC. The detector has
to be segmented to possess capability to handle the wide dynamic range of particle
multiplicity as the entire system, and each detector element has to be well designed
for multi-particle hits.

Since the BBC will be placed at a very forward angle, it will be irradiated with
an enormous amount of charged and neutral particles from beam-beam collisions,
albedo particles from materials surrounding the detector, and more seriously with
beam associated backgrounds. A simulation estimates that the gamma- and neutron-
ﬂux at the position might be about 1010 and 1011/cm2/RHIC-year, respectively. The
detector must be resistant against such a large radiation dose. In addition to this,
due to geometrical restrictions of the PHENIX conﬁguration, access to the BBC after
the rolling in is very limited. The detector has accordingly to work maintenance free
for a long period.

There is a magnetic ﬁeld of about 0.3T mostly parallel to the beam axis under the
normal magnet operation. The detector must operate under such a high magnetic
ﬁeld, since the ﬁeld is too strong to shield with any magnetic materials down to an
operational level of standard photomultiplier tubes.

Our technological choice is to build the BBC as an array detector composed by 64
identical Cherenkov counters. Figs 2a and 2b depict the individual detector element
and the array mounted on a mechanical frame. The detector element consists of four
components; a Cherenkov radiation material, a photomultiplier tube, a high-voltage
divider module and mechanical accessories to pack and mount them on the frame.
The Cherenkov radiator and the photomultiplier tube are made to be in one body,
in order to avoid using any glue or optical grease to join the two parts together.
The Cherenkov radiator component, which is in fact a very thick window of the
photomultiplier tube, is made of fused Quartz and has a hexagonal shape inscribing
1” diameter circle and 30mm long. The photomultiplier tube was designed on the
basis of an existing tube of 1” in diameter, Hamamatsu R3432, which has 15 layers
of ﬁne mesh dynode and is supposed to be operational in a magnetic ﬁeld. Several
prototypes of photomultiplier elements were produced in Hamamatsu Photonics and
tested with pion beams at KEK and with heavy ion beams at AGS-BNL.

3 Results from Prototype Tests

3.1 Prototype tests with pion beams

Three rounds (T285, T298 and T322) of beam tests were carried out at the 12GeV
Proton Synchrotron facility of KEK. A typical setup at the beam line T2 is illustrated

3

in Fig. 3. We used a negative pion beam with its momentum of 1.6 GeV/c. A typical
beam rate was around 1,000/cm2 in a 1.6s beam spill with a beam deﬁnition of;

which was used as a trigger for data taking. A 35cm-long solenoid magnet with an
inner bore radius of 10cm was employed to generate a magnetic ﬁeld. The prototype
detector element was placed at the center, where the magnet produces almost a ﬂat
ﬁeld within 0.2%/cm along the axis.

⊗

ADC and TDC data from the prototype detector labeled TEST and two time
reference counters, REF1 and REF2, were read out with standard CAMAC modules
by a PC based DAQ system. The ADC spectrum of the prototype detector and the
TOF spectrum between the prototype and one of reference counters are shown in
Figs. 4a and 4b, respectively. The ADC spectrum shows a single peak, however, that
can not be approximated by either a Poisson or a Gaussian distribution.

The intrinsic timing resolution of 100ps is achieved under the magnetic ﬁeld of
0.3T by using a leading edge discriminator without any software cuts or corrections.
It is improved up to 50ps with the standard slewing correction [2] using the ADC
information without any cuts. The typical TOF spectrum after the correction is seen
in Fig. 4c. Dependence of the current gain and the intrinsic timing resolution were
studied as a function of strength of applied magnetic ﬁeld in Fig. 5. There is a clear
drop of ADC gain by 30% immediately after the magnetic ﬁeld was switched on, but
shows a plateau until 0.3T and again decreases gradually beyond this ﬁeld strength.
The timing resolution after corrections, however, does not indicate any degradation
and keeps the performance at the same level.

3.2 Prototype test with heavy-ion beam

The performance of the prototype detector element for single particles was studied
using pion beams, but in reality we also need to examine characteristics of the per-
formances for a multi-particle shot in a detector array. For this purpose, another test
was carried out using heavy-ion beams from the AGS at BNL. The test setup in Fig.
6 was placed downstream of the MPS experiment on the A1 line, and measurements
were performed with a gold beam at 14.5 GeV/c per nucleon impinging on a 5 mm
thick lead target. The beam envelope was deﬁned by a beam deﬁning counter BDF.
Two time reference counters, REF1 and REF2 were placed in front of the target.
They provide the start time signals for TOF measurement and measure the charge of
the incident heavy ion. A nuclear reaction was detected with a small pulse height in
a beam-veto counter VETO and with large pulse heights in tagging counters, TAG1
and TAG2, which were placed in front of the test detectors. Seven prototype detector
elements were assembled to form an array with the realistic gap spacing. ADC and
TDC data from all the counters were read out with standard CAMAC modules by a
PC based DAQ system. Data were accumulated with a trigger of;

The array was set at 15◦ with respect to the beam line, and the distance from the
target to the detectors was typically 35cm. We could expect around 10 charged
particles entering the array from a central collision.

Fig. 7a shows an ADC distribution of one of the prototype detector positioned at
the center of the array, and Fig. 7b shows the TOF spectrum between the detector and
one of the time reference counters. The ADC spectrum is quite diﬀerent from those
of the pion beam tests in Fig. 4a. It implies a large amount of background particles
hitting the detector with small pulse heights and they might hide the ADC peak for a
single particle hit. It was found that the majority of background particles came from
adjacent detectors. The same slewing correction process applied to the pion beam
data, was employed to this data. The timing resolution of 54ps was achieved in Fig.
7c, but the resolution before the correction is worse than that of pion beam tests,
because of the much broader ADC spectrum.

4 Discussion

4.1 Detector concept

In order to accept leading particles traveling at the speed of light, the BBC must
be set in a small space at the very forward angle. Here the particle multiplicity
per unit area could be extremely high for central nuclear collisions. The multiplicity,
however, varies greatly depending on the impact parameter of the collision in question.
Consequently, the number of particles hitting individual detector elements varies, and
the detector elements must accommodate multiple particles entering anywhere on the
face of the detector.

Once we consider a possibility of detector coupled with a photon counter, it is a
natural solution to employ Cherenkov radiation light instead of scintillation light. A
fast charged particle passing through a transparent material will radiate Cherenkov
light. A photon counter optically coupled to this material will measures the light.
Such Cherenkov light is always produced, but is usually negligibly small compared
to the light signal from a scintillating material. However, if multiple particles enter
a single detector, the Cherenkov light becomes large enough to ﬁre a discriminator
and trigger a TDC a few hundred ps prior to the scintillation light, which comes later
due to the larger time constant of the scintillating process. This timing gap prevents
precise timing measurements.

Another diﬃculty of precise time measurements in high multiplicity environments
is that the photon counter should be placed at a position where the photon counter
can view the entire detection volume at a constant distance. Otherwise the photon
counter measures the earliest time from light generated in the nearest hit spot. We
would then see considerable time spread originating from variation of the optical path
length inside the detector. In other words, a detector designed like a paddle counter
even viewed with double photon counters at the both ends would not work well in
this case.

The solution that we chose is a compact Cherenkov detector with a high-speed

5

photomultiplier tube immediately behind the radiator material along the particle
direction, and multiple detector elements form an array surrounding a beam pipe at
very forward angles.

4.2 Radiator shape optimization

The Cherenkov radiator shape must be optimized to collect the maximum number of
photons. We have two parameters to be determined; the radiator length determining
the number of photons produced, and the outer shape determining the photon col-
lection by internal reﬂection onto the cathode plane. The speed of light in a Quartz
radiator is slower than the speed of light in vacuum by a factor of the index of refrac-
tion. The path length of photons traversing the radiator is much longer than that of
the particle, since the photons are radiated at the Cherenkov angle of about 45◦ in
Quartz with respect to the direction of the particle. As the result, Cherenkov photons
produced near the front of radiator arrive at the photo-cathode later than the parti-
cle, whereas the arrival time of photons produced at the back of radiator is almost
the same as that of the particle. This fact introduces a spread (σ1) of photon arrival
time and the spread results in deterioration of timing resolution of the detector. To
minimize the spread, the length of the radiator must be as short as possible. On the
other hand, a reasonable number of photons in a photomultiplier tube is necessary
for a good signal ratio to noise and for reduction of another time spread (σ2), which
is originated from ﬂuctuation of traveling time by photo-electrons from the cathode
to the anodes in a photomultiplier tube. A larger number of photo-electrons reduces
the ﬂuctuation smaller. This temporal ﬂuctuation is characterized by the transit time
spread for a single photon detection, which is measured to be 0.33ns for this particular
photomultiplier tube.

1 + σ2
σ2

In Fig. 8, we show the results of a simple model calculation with an assumption
of the photo-cathode sensitivity N0 of 100, for several values of the mixing parameter
c, where σ = qc
2. If we take c = 1, the optimized radiator length is around
15mm.
In order to verify the calculation and to study the eﬀects of outer shape
of radiator, we have tested several prototype counters with hexagonal and circular
shaped radiators of diﬀerent lengths. In Fig. 9, we plotted the test results of the
timing resolution as a function of the radiator length. The model calculation with
the parameter c
0.25 seems to explain the global tendency rather well. Though
the model is too simple to explain everything, we could understand the trend and
choose the length to be 3cm. The shortest possible radiator is used, because a shorter
radiator prevents cross talk between adjacent detector elements when a particle enters
with a shallow angle.

≈

The ADC spectrum taken with a circular shaped radiator is shown in Fig. 10.
Comparing to Fig. 4a, which was taken with a hexagonal radiator, there is a clear
diﬀerence in the distribution. A Monte Carlo study simulating internal reﬂection of
photons inside the Quartz radiator block explains the dependence of the spectrum
shape on radiator shape and length very well. It is because the cathode sensitive area
is smaller than the radiator cross section, and some of the photons can not reach to
the sensitive area by internal reﬂection. The probability of this loss is a function of

6

the radial position of the incident particle, and the function strongly depends on the
radiator shape. We therefore see pulse height dependence on radial hit position in the
ADC spectrum. There is no noticeable diﬀerence on the timing resolution between
the circular and hexagonal radiators. We have chosen the hexagonal shape, because
the higher hermeticity is important for proton on proton collisions and because of the
preferable single peak feature in the pulse height distribution.

4.3 Radiation hardness

Radiation damage in a photomultiplier tube usually results in a gradual lowering of
transparency of the window material due to color center creation. Negligibly small
eﬀects on the photo-cathode or dynode materials are expected because of their quite
low thickness [3]. In this design, the photomultiplier tube has a very thick window
compared to a standard tube and high transparencies at short wavelengths are essen-
tial to collect the Cherenkov light. The optical degradation of the window material
from radiation damage is seriously examined. As described in the previous section,
since this thick window serves as a Cherenkov radiator, there is no glue or grease
used. This ensures no loss of photons at any joint gap and highly improves the relia-
bility of the detector element both mechanically and in radiation hardness, since glues
and grease lose transparency at short wavelength after radiation exposure. We chose
fused Quartz of SPRASIL grade as the window material, since it is one of the most
radiation hard materials and provides excellent transparency at short wavelength. It
has been studied [3] that, for wavelengths down to around 220nm, the Quartz does
not indicate any serious degradation of transparency for thermal neutron radiation
up to 1014/cm2, which corresponds to the total amount of neutron radiation during
1000-year operation at RHIC. We tested radiation hardness of the prototype detector
against γ-rays. The detector was irradiated with 1MR of γ-rays from 60Co at the
Radioisotope Center of Hiroshima University. The total amount of γ-ray irradiation
is approximately 105 times larger than that expected in 1-year RHIC operation, and
no deterioration of the detector was observed.

4.4 Collision time determination

The purpose of the BBC is to determine a unique value of the collision time from
multiple measurements of secondary particles. This function is demonstrated with
a small array of prototype detectors in the heavy-ion beam test. There are two
simple ideas to derive the collision time. One is to adopt the smallest TDC value
in each event and neglect any other signals. It corresponds to looking at the fastest
particle in the collision of interest. Another is to take an average over all the time
information in each event. This may include undesirable particles at the velocities
slower than the speed of light. These two simple methods are demonstrated in Fig.
11a and 11b, where TOF spectra between the BBC and a time reference counter
REF1 are plotted. For comparison, Fig. 11c shows a TOF spectrum of all the time
information available over all events in question. Both of the methods provide the
time resolution of around 40ps, which is slightly better than the timing resolution of

7

each detector element. Although the number of sample measurements is only seven,
it is because of multiple measurements of the single value in each event. In the real
experiment, a larger number of independent measurements are expected and a better
timing resolution can be obtained accordingly.

4.5 Quality assurance test

The quality assurance test (T395) using the real detector elements built in the ﬁrst-
production-year was carried out at the 12 GeV Proton Synchrotron facility of KEK.
The setup at the beam line T2 is almost the same as that in ﬁg. 3. Fig. 12 shows
results of photomultiplier current gain and timing resolution of all the 37 detector
elements arranged in order of the gain. The data were taken by applying a constant
high-voltage value of 2.3kV to each photomultiplier tube under a magnetic ﬁeld of
0.3T. Although the spread of current gain between the lowest- and highest-gain tubes
at this voltage extends over a factor of 4, very stable operation of all detector elements
was observed. The timing performance is better than with the prototype detectors,
demonstrating the uniformity of the detector production process.

5 Conclusion

We have designed a start-timing detector for the PHENIX experiment at RHIC-BNL.
The detector is composed of 64 identical detector elements, placed at very forward
angles in the opposite ends of the central spectrometer. The detector element is a
Cherenkov counter consisting of a 3cm long hexagonal shaped Quartz radiator and
a photomultiplier tube of 1” in diameter with 12 stage mesh dynodes. The radiator
and the tube are united into one body.

The performance of prototype detectors was studied with pion beams under mag-
netic ﬁelds and with heavy-ion beams. The intrinsic timing resolution of the proto-
types was about 100ps without any corrections, and was about 50ps with standard
slewing corrections. The test experiment using heavy-ion beams demonstrates good
performance in the collision time determination by an array of seven prototype de-
tectors. The collision time resolution is about 40ps with this small detector array, so
a better timing resolution is expected for events with larger particle multiplicity in
the entire BBC conﬁguration at the PHENIX experiment.

The quality assurance test was performed with 37 real detector elements built in
the ﬁrst-production-year. The results of timing resolution are very stable, and all of
the elements attain a timing resolution of 80 - 90ps without any corrections. This 10ps
level ﬂuctuation is due to the diﬀerence in current gain of the photomultiplier tubes.
After slewing corrections, a resolution as good as 30ps is obtained, independent of
the current gain.

It is worth noting that, though the detector was developed for a particular ex-
periment, the detector element, which is now commercially available as R6178 from
Hamamatsu Photonics, can be employed in any experimental ﬁeld requiring a ﬁne

8

granularity of 1” in space and an excellent timing resolution better than 50ps under
a magnetic ﬁeld.

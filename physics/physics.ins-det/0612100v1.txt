Abstract

We present a new application of the Nomarski interferometer, to
measure the angular position of a parallel laser beam with interfero-
metric precision. In our experimental realization we reach a resolution
10−2 rad (1◦)
of 3
range. This alternative to the optical lever technique features absolute
calibration, independence of the sensitivity on the thermal drifts, and
wide range of measurement at full accuracy.

1 Introduction

Angle measurement is important in a number of applications, ranging from
machine tool operation to calibration of optical prism through atomic force
microscopy detection. This basic metrological task can be performed in many
ways with optical methods [1], using for instance an autocollimator [2], an
interferometric setup (see for example [3]) or an optical lever scheme with an
electronic target (such as a segmented photodiode) [4, 5]. A major challenge
of these techniques is to allow both a wide range of measurement and a high
precision simultaneously. We will focus here on interferometric setups, which
are usually restricted to small angle measurements but feature very good
accuracy. After a generic introduction to the sensitivity of these techniques,
we will present how their range can be greatly expanded without losing in
precision using a quadrature phase approach. This novel technique to per-
form calibrated measurements of the angular position of a parallel laser beam
is based on a quadrature phase Normarski interferometer [6], except for the
laser beam conﬁguration:
in the current setup, a single beam directly en-
ters the calcite prism and the common part of two resulting beam is directly
analyzed.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we explain the principle
of the technique under a wider approach of interferometric angle measure-
ments, while in section 3 we describe the actual experimental realization
and we report the results of the calibration measurements, emphasizing how
this technique allows constant recording of tiny rotations independently from
thermal drifts. In section 4 we discuss the sources of noise for the measure-
ments. In section 5 we compare our technique to the widespread optical lever
technique (based on a 2 quadrants photodiode’s detection), before concluding
in section 6.

2 Interferometric angle measurement: prin-

ciple

Let us ﬁrst discuss the general background of the measurement we want to
perform here: we consider a single laser beam with origin O in the ex, ey
plane, and we would like to measure through interferometry its angular di-
rection (the rotation is thus deﬁned around ez).
In the analyzing region,
there should be at least 2 beams in order to have interference. To achieve

2

the best contrast possible, these two beams should have a constant phase dif-
ference over the sensor area. This implies in general (given that the sensor is
ﬂat and its size is much greater than the wavelength λ) that the 2 analyzing
beams are parallel plane waves over the sensor, and thus in the free space
just before it. Their common wave vector is denoted by k in this region (see
Fig.1).

Let us now consider the optical path of a ray from the origin O of the
incident beam to point A of the ﬁrst analyzing beam, and a equivalent path
from point O to B in the second beam, such that the optical lengths are
equal: OA=OB. As long as A an B are chosen in the free space region before
the sensor, the phase diﬀerence between the two beams is

ϕ = k.AB

If we make an inﬁnitesimal change of the incident laser beam, A will change
to A′ = A + δA and B to B′ = B + δB, where we still impose that
OA’=OA=OB’=OB. The corresponding phase variation between the two
beams is thus

δϕ = δk.AB + k.δAB

δϕ = δk.AB + k.δB

k.δA

−

According to Fermat’s principle, the optical path is extremal, which im-
plies for free space propagation that the direction of propagation of light
is perpendicular to the iso optical length surfaces.
It translates here into
k.δB = k.δA = 0, so that

= 2π/λ is a constant, we will only sense rotation of the

where θ is the angular direction of the beams, and d their separation perpen-
dicular to the propagation (see Fig.1).

The only assumption underlying the previous calculation is that the
optical systems is still: Fermat’s principle applies to a constant refractive
medium. Let us add the hypothesis that the angular magniﬁcation is one,
and we can apply eq. 1 to the dependence of the phase diﬀerence between
the two interfering beams over the orientation of the incident beam.

According to eq. 1, it sounds like there is no limit to the sensitivity, as it
is increasing linearly with the distance between the two light rays. However,
one should keep in mind that the beams have a ﬁnite lateral extension, and to
record interference we should overlap them. In gaussian beam approximation,
one can show that the optimum sensitivity is achieved when the separation
d is equal to the 1/e2 radius of the beams (see section 3, eq. 6).

3 Experimental setup

We present in this section the experimental setup we have built to demon-
strate the workability of an interferometric measurement of the angular po-
sition of a single light beam, as schemed on ﬁg. 2. The output of an He-Ne
laser is sent into a single-mode polarization maintaining ﬁber, then colli-
mated to a parallel beam of 1/e2 diameter 2W = 6.6 mm. The ﬁber end
and collimator are hold by a kinematic mount with a piezo drive to change
the angular direction θ of the light beam before it enters a 40 mm calcite
prism. We end up with two parallel beams of crossed polarization, separated
by d = 4 mm, thus overlapping a few millimeters. A diaphragm limits the
output to this overlapping area. The intensities of the 2 light rays are evenly
tuned by adjusting the incident polarization at 45◦ with respect to the calcite
optical axes. No interference can be seen at this stage since the two beams
have crossed polarizations, though they present a phase shift ϕ dependent
on the angle of incidence θ of the initial beam on the calcite.

To analyze these overlapping beams, we use a quadrature phase technique
similar to the one of ref. [6]. They are ﬁrst divided into two equivalents rays
with a non polarizing cube beamsplitter. In both arms, the beam is focused
on the detector through a second 5 mm calcite prism, which optical axis are
oriented at 45◦ with respect to the ﬁrst one. We project this way the two ini-
tial polarizations and make the two incident beams interfere: the intensities
A and B of the 2 beams emerging the last calcite prism are functions of the
phase shift ϕ and can be recorded by two photodiodes (since the two spots
are only 0.5 mm distant, we actually use a 2 quadrants photodiode). In the
second analyzing arm, a quarter wave plate is added in order to subtract π/2
to the phase shift ϕ between the two cross polarized beams.

Measured intensities An, Bn in the two analyzing arms n (with n = 1, 2)

are easily computed as:

An =

(1 + Cmax cos(ϕ + ψn))

I0
4
I0
4

−

Bn =

(1

Cmax cos(ϕ + ψn))

(2)

where I0 is the total intensity corresponding to the incident light beam1, Cmax
is a contrast factor which accounts for lateral extension of the beams (Cmax <
1), and ψ1 = 0 (ﬁrst arm, without quarter wave plate) or ψ2 =
π/2 (second
arm, with quarter wave plate). With adapted low noise analog conditioning
electronic, we can measure for each arm the contrast function of these two
signals:

−

Cn =

Bn
An −
An + Bn

= Cmax cos(ϕ + ψn)

(3)

This way, we get rid of ﬂuctuations of laser intensity, and have a direct
measurement of the cosine of the total phase shift for each arm, ϕ + ψn.

Let us rewrite eq. 3 as:

C = C1 + i C2 = Cmax (cos(ϕ) + i sin(ϕ)) = Cmaxeiϕ

(4)

Under this formulation, the advantage of using two analyzing arms instead of
one is obvious : it allows one to have a complete determination of ϕ (modulo
2π). In the (C1, C2) plane, a measurement will lie on the Cmax radius circle,
its polar angle being the phase shift ϕ. All we need to do is acquire the
two contrasts and numerically compute ϕ. Eq. 1 can directly be used to
compute the sensitivity of the measurement of the angular position of the
incident beam2: all the hypothesis of section 2 are met (still optics, angular
magniﬁcation one).

The sensitivity appears this way to be independent of the position on
the circle of the measurement, and will be constant even with a slow thermal
drift. The beam separation d is in reality function of the angle of incidence θ,
but its variation is small in the full θ range available: the main limitation to
the angle of incidence that can be measured is that each beam emerging the

1I0 is the electrical intensity deﬁned by I0 = SP , where P is the incident beam power
(in W ) and S is the responsivity of the photodiodes (in A/W). The 1/4 factor in the
equations accounts for the beam-splitting process (2 ﬁnal beams in both analyzing arms).
2The same formula can be derived directly analyzing the particular design of the optical

setup of ﬁg. 2, using birefringence laws instead of the formalism of section 2.

last calcites in the analyzing arms should fall on its respective photodiode
quadrant. Given the focal length of the focusing lens (f = 25 mm) and the
separation of the 2 beams (d′ = 0.5 mm), the range accessible in θ in our
10−2 rad. Note that this range can be greatly
setup is θmax = d′/f = 2
extended if useful, choosing a larger separation of the ﬁnal beams (using a
Wollaston prism and 2 distinct photodiodes for example [7]).

×

To demonstrate the operation of this technique, we rotate the beam by
means of a piezoelectric ceramic. The driving voltage that we use is the sum
of two sinusoids: a fast one of low amplitude (leading to a µrad rotation) and
a slow one of high amplitude (simulating a slow drift of the working point
of the interferometer over several wavelengths, that is a rotation of about
1 mrad). In Fig. 3(a), we plot as a function of time a typical driving of the
beam’s angular rotation θ. In this speciﬁc case the slow and fast sinusoids
have a frequency of 10 mHz and of 10 Hz respectively and the amplitude
ratio is about 400. The contrasts C1 and C2 of the two analyzing arms, as
expected, are in phase quadrature. In Fig. 4 we also plot the contrasts C1
and C2 in the (C1, C2) plane to show that they lay on a circle. In fact, the
measurement lays on a tilted ellipse, but this deviation from the Cmax radius
circle can easily be corrected [8].

Let us now have a closer look at the fast evolution of these signals. In Fig.
5 we plot as a function of time the fast angular displacement δθ and contrasts
cn obtained by a high pass ﬁltration of the signals θ and Cn. Comparing
Figs. 5(b) and (c) with Figs. 3(b) and (c) we see that c1(c2) goes to 0
periodically when C1(C2) is extremal while the reconstructed angular position
has a constant amplitude. Therefore this technique allows constant recording
of small rotations as shown in the precedent paragraph. This is clearly seen
in Fig. 6 where the fast evolution of δθ, c1 and c2 are plotted on a time
interval around a minimum of C1 and C2. The cleanness of the curve of Fig.
6(a) demonstrates the accuracy of this measurement.

4 Noise of the measurement

Let us compute the sensitivity σ of the contrast C as a function of the angle
of incidence θ. Using eq. 1 and 4, we have:

forward to show that

(cid:19)

and from eq. 2 we directly identify Cmax as

Cmax = e

− d2
2W 2

(6)

The sensitivity σ being proportional to Cmaxd (eq. 5), we can easily show
that it is maximum when the separation between the beams is equal to their
1/e2 radius: d = W , where we get Cmax = 0.61. In fact, this conﬁguration
is not the best one can use to maximize the sensitivity: adding a diaphragm
to limit the beams to their common part, we can compute numerically the
optimum parameters: d/W = 1.08 with a diaphragm of diameter 2.25W ,
which lead to Cmax = 0.65 and raise the sensitivity of 15%.

The main source of noise in the measurement is the unavoidable shot
noise of the photodiodes. Let δAn and δBn be the intensity ﬂuctuations
on the photodiodes, their power spectra are white noises of spectral densities
SAn = 2eAn and SBn = 2eBn, e being the elementary charge. Moreover, these
noises are uncorrelated. They will result in a ﬂuctuation in the contrasts δCn
given by the equations:

δCn = δ

In Fig. 8 we plot the power spectrum density Sθ produced by a still

103 Hz region are attributed to mechanical disturbances in the
the 10 Hz
experimental setup and could be addressed by a quieter environment, while
at low frequency (below 50 Hz) the electronics 1/f noise is visible. We can
see that our setup is close to optimal conditions. Finally we note that in
terms of optical path diﬀerence, these values correspond to a sensitivity of
2

10−27 m2/Hz.

5 Comparison with optical lever technique

In the classic optical lever technique, the single beam illuminates a 2 quad-
rants photodiode, as sketched in ﬁg. 7. A contrast function C2Q of the

8

intensities of the two quadrants (ratio of the diﬀerence and the sum of the
signals, similar to the one deﬁned in eq. 3) can be used to measure the posi-
tion of this light beam on the sensor. The output of a gaussian beam of 1/e2
radius w at a distance y of the zero width slit is:

Where erf is the error function. The best sensitivity is obtained for y
and for the smallest w, that is when the beam is focused on the sensor:

where w0 is the radius of the beam waist. This spot is diﬀraction limited,
so the size of the beam at its origin O can be computed by W = λl/πw0,
where l is the distance between O and the sensor. When the beam direction

We have supposed up to now a zero width slit for the segmented photodiode.
Interestingly, the noise can be reduced by introducing a gap between the

quadrants [5]. The optimum value of the separation is 0.61w0, which reduces
the power spectrum density of shot noise induced ﬂuctuations of 22%.

Under optimal condition for both techniques, the numerical value of this ratio
is 3.2, which means that the interferometric technique is a bit noisier than
the optical lever technique, when both are perfectly tuned. Nevertheless, our
setup oﬀers key advantages over the 2 quadrants detection:

•

•

•

Absolute calibration: the interferometric measurement only depends on
λ and d, two quantities that can be precisely measured independently,
whereas the optical lever sensitivity depends on the exact focalization
of the beam and needs to be calibrated for every experiment.

Extended deﬂection range: in the present example, deﬂection up to 103
greater can be studied with the interferometric method (and this factor
could even be raised by choosing a bigger separation of the analyzing
beams in each arms). It implies that strong variations of θ cannot be
studied with great precision with the optical lever detection, for which
any slow drift requires a constant adjustment of the 0. The sensitivity
of our technique is moreover constant on the whole range.

Translation insensitive: the measurement is only sensitive to the rota-
tion we are probing (around ez), and is insensitive to any translation,
whereas the other method will sense translation along ey as well as
rotation. Our technique is thus more selective and less sensitive to
mechanical vibrations of the setup.

6 Conclusion

We have proposed an interferometric technique to measure the angular posi-
tion of a laser beam, which can represent an alternative to the optical lever
10−4 ′′) for
one. The sensitivity of this experimental realization is 3 nrad (6
1 kHz bandwidth on a range of 20 mrad (1.15◦), and it can be improved in

×

10

various ways (larger calcite and beam size, brighter light source, larger sepa-
ration of beams in detection area, etc.) Although the sensitivity of the optical
lever may be a bit better than that of the interferometric setup, our technique
oﬀers several advantages: robustness (insensitivity to thermal drift, and in
general to mechanical vibrations expect for the rotation probed), absolute
calibration, large angular range.

As a ﬁnal remark, let us point out another way to use the setup: one can
rotate the ﬁrst calcite prism with a still laser beam. In this conﬁguration, the
sensitivity is unchanged and still described by eq. 1 (where θ stand for the
angular position of the prism this time), but the range is greatly extended.
The limitation is no longer due to the analyzing arms (the focusing lenses
will always ensure that the beams fall on their respective photodiodes), but
simply to the ﬁeld of view of the initial calcite. For our setup, a 0.2 rad
range can be easily be explored. Nevertheless, one should take into account
variations of d with θ in this case, since they are not negligible over such a
wide range of measurement.

cused on a 2 quadrants photodiode, and for small deﬂections θ, the diﬀerence
between the intensities on the 2 segments is a linear function of θ.

Figure 8: Power spectrum density of the angular deﬂection θ (plain line), and
shot noise calculated from inequality 7 with experimental values of intensity
103 Hz region
and sensitivity (dash dotted line). The pics in the 10 Hz
are attributed to mechanical disturbances in the experimental setup and
could be addressed by a quieter environment. The integrated noise in the
0 Hz
1 kHz range is 3 nrad, which is thus the lower limit of measurable
angular displacement for this bandwidth.

Abstract

We developed a prototype time projection chamber using gas electron multipliers
(GEM-TPC) for high energy heavy ion collision experiments. To investigate its
performance, we conducted a beam test with 3 kinds of gases (Ar(90%)-CH4(10%),
Ar(70%)-C2H6(30%) and CF4). Detection eﬃciency of 99%, and spatial resolution of
79 µm in the pad-row direction and 313 µm in the drift direction were achieved. The
test results show that the GEM-TPC meets the requirements for high energy heavy
ion collision experiments. The conﬁguration and performance of the GEM-TPC are
described.

1 Introduction

High particle multiplicity is an important feature to be considered in de-
tector designs for high energy heavy ion collision experiments. In √sN N =
200 GeV Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)
at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the average charged particle multiplic-
is 170 [1]. Therefore, average charged particle density is
ity
0.03 cm−2 at a distance of 30 cm from the vertex. Additionally, experiments
at RHIC are performed at a high event rate of about 10 kHz and the charged
particle rate is 300 cps/cm2 at a distance of 30 cm from the vertex. This harsh
environment demands highly eﬃcient central tracking detectors.

A wide variety of observables are measured in high energy heavy ion collision
experiments: Such as charged particle multiplicities, yield ratios and spectra
of identiﬁed hadrons, elliptic ﬂow, suppression of high pT particle production
and heavy ﬂavor production [2]. Therefore, several particular features are re-
quired for the detectors used. A relatively wide transverse momentum range
0.2–20 GeV/c) is required to be covered to take in the broad interests
(pT ∼
of high energy heavy ion collisions and the magnetic ﬁeld should be kept low

is required for future measurements such as the Υ states at RHIC-II [3]. To
achieve such good momentum resolution with a magnetic ﬁeld of 1 T, a 1-m
200 µm is needed. Double
radius solenoidal tracker with spatial resolution of
track resolution is also required to be better than 1 cm to cope with the high
particle multiplicity. Such high ﬂux operational and multi hit capabilities have
recently also been required in particle physics experiments [4].

One of the candidates as a detector that satisﬁes the above requirements is
a combination of a time projection chamber (TPC), a sophisticated detector
for particle tracking and particle identiﬁcation, and micro patter gas detectors
(MPGDs) [5] such as gas electron multipliers (GEMs) [6]. Although existing
wire chambers need gating wires to collect positive ions and have limitations
in their double track resolution by the wire spacing, the novel structure of a
GEM has the following advantages in its application to TPC readout:

Two dimensional symmetry of the GEM structure provides a large ﬂexibility
in the readout geometry.
Large areas can be covered with a low amount of material since support
mechanics for a GEM are simple.
The intense electric ﬁeld region will be limited inside the holes and the
E
B eﬀect is expected to be reduced. (In a strong magnetic ﬁeld, this
eﬀect results in a broadening of the electron cloud and a worsening of the
resolution.)
The signal of the readout pad is induced by ampliﬁed electrons, and is

spatially narrow and fast.
The generated ions do not aﬀect the signal and the ion tail of the signal will
be suppressed.
The positive ion feedback into the drift region can be suppressed by a factor
of about 10 due to the electric ﬁeld around the GEM holes and so gating
wires might be unnecessary.

Therefore, a TPC using a GEM for signal ampliﬁcation (GEM-TPC) may
achieve high rate capability as well as excellent double track and spatial res-
olution. A GEM-TPC is a strong candidate to be a central tracking detector
in high energy heavy ion collision experiments [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].

2 GEM-TPC Prototype

2.1 Mechanical Structure

A GEM-TPC prototype, consisting of an end cap chamber, a gas vessel and
a ﬁeld cage, was developed [12]. Photographs of the GEM-TPC prototype are
shown in Fig. 1. Figure 2 shows a schematic view of the GEM-TPC.

×

10 cm2)
The end cap chamber mounts a triple GEM (the eﬀective area is 10
on readout pads. The triple GEM was constructed from GEM foils made
at CERN [13]. The gap between neighboring GEMs was 2 mm and the gap
between the bottom GEM and the pads was 1.5 mm. High voltages are applied
to the triple GEM through connectors penetrating the end cap chamber with a
resistor chain. Two kinds of readout pads with diﬀerent shapes, rectangle and
chevron (zigzag), were used to study the dependence of the spatial resolution
on shape (see Fig. 3). Since chevron pads may increase the number of hits
on pads by charge sharing, chevron pads are expected to have better spatial
resolution than rectangular ones [14]. Both kinds of pads, both made of gold-
12.0 mm2 and the same pitch
plated copper, have the same area of 1.09
of 1.27 mm. Relatively narrow width pads are required for charge sharing for
small diﬀusion gases such as CF4 [12, 15].

×

The ﬁeld cage is a cuboid with dimensions of 36 (drift direction)
×
and creates a uniform electric drift ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld uniformity is
30 cm
10 cm2 which corresponds
0 cm (E⊥/E)dz
R
to the GEM eﬀective area. The ﬁeld cage consists of 115 gold-plated copper
strips connected with 1-MΩ resistors in series on FR4 boards. At the end of
the resistor chain, additional resistors are placed to match the voltage at the
bottom of the ﬁeld cage with the surface voltage of the top GEM.

2.2 Front End Electronics

A charge sensitive preampliﬁer, consisting of two kinds of operational ampli-
ﬁers (AD8058 and AD8132, Analog Devices, Inc.), was used for the GEM-
TPC. Its time constant is τ = 1 µs and its eﬀective gain G = 3.2 V/pC. The
gain of the preampliﬁer was determined from the expected signal amplitude

ethane(C2H6)(30%) and pure tetraﬂuoromethane(CF4)(99.999%) gas, were
used to study the performance of the GEM-TPC. Properties of these gases
are shown in Table 1. Drift velocities and diﬀusion coeﬃcients were calculated
by Magboltz [16].

Ar(90%)-CH4(10%) is widely used in TPCs and GEMs [11, 17, 18]. A fast
drift velocity that peaks at a low electric ﬁeld of 130 V/cm is the primary
attribute of Ar-CH4, and such a low electric ﬁeld is an advantage for de-
tector operation. However, its large diﬀusion coeﬃcients are a disadvantage.
Ar(70%)-C2H6(30%) is a common chamber gas, but there are few results for
it with a GEM. Although its diﬀusion coeﬃcients are smaller than those of
Ar-CH4, the drift velocity peaks at a relatively high electric ﬁeld of 550 V/cm.
CF4 gas is studied as a TPC and GEM gas because of its very small diﬀusion
coeﬃcients and very fast drift velocity [12, 15]. These properties of CF4 will
be advantages in high particle multiplicity environments of high energy heavy
ion collision experiments. However, a high electric ﬁeld is needed to achieve a
fast drift velocity with CF4.

The gas ﬂow rate was set at
E40, ESTEC Co., Ltd.). Gas pressure was set at the atmospheric pressure
using a bubbler ﬁlled with silicone oil.

Eﬀective gas gains were measured using an 55Fe X-ray (5.9 keV) source. An
X ray creates primary electrons by a photoelectric eﬀect with a gas molecule.
The obtained 55Fe X-ray spectrum with CF4 is shown in Fig. 4. The energy
resolution, σE/E, with Ar-CH4, Ar-C2H6 and CF4 is 11%, 10% and 13%,
respectively. The obtained energy resolution is comparable with the result
by another research group (16% for CF4 and 9% for Ar(70%)-CO2(30%)) [19].
The gains for the 3 kinds of gases are shown as a function of the voltage across
the GEMs in Fig. 5 and a gain of 104 was achieved with each gas. Although
CF4 needs a higher voltage than Ar-CH4 and Ar-C2H6 to achieve the same
gain, the slopes of the gain curves are similar for the 3 gases.

The characteristics of the GEM-TPC evaluated in the performance test were
detection eﬃciency, spatial resolution in the pad-row direction and the drift di-
rection and particle identiﬁcation capability by dE/dx measurement. The de-
pendence of these characteristics on the 3 kinds of gases (Ar(90%)-CH4(10%),
104), the drift
Ar(70%)-C2H6(30%) and CF4), the GEM gain (7
length (20–290 mm), the readout pad shape (rectangle and chevron), the beam
momentum (0.5–3.0 GeV/c) and the beam rate was also evaluated.

triggering and time of ﬂight measurements for particle identiﬁcation. Two
gas Cherenkov counters (GCC1 and GCC2) ﬁlled with 2.5-atm CO2 gas were
used for electron identiﬁcation. Two silicon strips detectors (SSD1 and SSD2),
each of which consists of two single sided strips (strip pitch of 80 µm) crossing
at right angles, were used for particle tracking. Two hadron blind detectors
(HBD1 and HBD2) were tested at the same time and the results are shown
in [20]. The GEM-TPC was operated without a magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 7 shows a typical signal of the GEM-TPC operated with Ar-C2H6. The
signal was recorded for 6.4 µs (=640 samples) in one event. One channel of
the ADC corresponds to
4 mV. To extract the pulse height and the arrival
time of the signal, the following function is ﬁtted to the FADC spectrum,

where t is sampling time. The ﬁtting parameters in the above function can
be recognized as follows: p0 is the pedestal, p1 is the pulse height, p2 is the
arrival time, p3 is the time constant of the electronics and p4 is the rise time.
The obtained pulse height and arrival time are used for determinations of the
hit position. The hit position in each pad row is determined by an amplitude

4.2 Transverse Diﬀusion Coeﬃcient

Transverse diﬀusion coeﬃcients were measured with 1-GeV/c π− beams. The
coeﬃcients are evaluated using the spatial distribution of secondary electrons
in the pad-row direction. The secondary electron distribution is ﬁtted by a
Gaussian distribution. The obtained sigma of Gaussian, sx, can be expressed
as

s2
x(L) = s2

x0 + C 2

L,

DT ·

(4)

where L is the drift length, CDT is the transverse diﬀusion coeﬃcient and
sx0 is the intrinsic width of the induced charge distribution determined by
the readout system conﬁguration. Figure 9 shows s2
x as a function of the drift
length. The measured sx0 and CDT are shown in Table 2. The measured values
of CDT of Ar-C2H6 and CF4 agree well with the calculated values of CDT shown
in Table 1; however, for Ar-CH4 the measured one is slightly smaller than the
calculated one.

4.3 Spatial Resolution

Single-pad-row spatial resolution in the pad-row and drift directions was eval-
uated for a drift length range of 20–290 mm with 1-GeV/c π− beams. The
single-pad-row spatial resolution in both directions was evaluated by the resid-
ual between the hit position of the 2nd pad row and the interpolated hit posi-
tion from the 1st and 3rd pad rows. The measured spatial resolution is shown
in Fig. 10. The eﬀect of diﬀusion on the spatial resolution in both directions is
clearly seen. The best resolution is 79 µm in the pad-row direction and 313 µm
in the drift direction, obtained with Ar-C2H6 gas and rectangular pads at 13-
mm drift. The spatial resolution of the chevron pads is almost the same as
that of the rectangular ones. If the charge distribution is Gaussian, the spatial
resolution of the chevron pads should be better than that of the rectangular
ones [14]. A possible reason for the result obtained is that the ﬁnite sizes of the

11

GEM holes distort the charge distribution from a Gaussian distribution and
so the non-Gaussian tails worsen the spatial resolution of the chevron pads.

ondary electrons, Nef f , for 1-GeV/c π− beams and a track length of 12 mm

4.4 Beam Rate Dependence

One of the advantages of the GEM-TPC is its ion feedback suppression. The
eﬀect of ion feedback on GEM-TPC performance was studied by measuring
the beam rate dependence of the detection eﬃciency and spatial resolution.
The beam rate was determined by the beam slit width and the rate was
2.5 cm2). The beams of e+, π+ and p at
monitored with the S2 scintillator (2.5
×
a momentum of 2 GeV/c and Ar-CH4 gas were used, while the drift length was
85 mm. The results are shown in Fig. 11. The results of the detection eﬃciency
and the spatial resolution in the previous subsections were obtained with a
500 cps/cm2. At the maximum beam rate of 4800 cps/cm2,
beam rate of
the detection eﬃciency and the spatial resolution were worsened by factors
of 2.5
3%, respectively. The maximum total beam rate in the
active GEM-TPC region was in the order of 105 cps.

0.5% and 11

≤

±

±

This result is worse than the results from the other research group with beams
105 cps/cm2 [7]. Because of the limited readout area of our GEM-TPC
of 1.5
3.6 cm2), it was not possible to fully distinguish double tracks, which
(1
worsened the detection eﬃciency and the spatial resolution.

×

×

The beam rate exceeds the typical rates in √sN N =200 GeV Au+Au collisions
at RHIC and √sN N =5.5 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at LHC, which are 300 cps/cm2
and 1400 cps/cm2, respectively, at a distance of 30 cm from the vertex. Since
4800 cps/cm2 is much larger than these numbers, the eﬀect of the ion feedback
on the GEM-TPC performance can be regarded as negligible for our purpose.

4.5 Particle Identiﬁcation Using dE/dx

Energy losses, dE/dx, were measured for positrons, muons, pions, protons
and deuterons in a beam momentum range of 0.5–3.0 GeV/c to evaluate the
particle identiﬁcation capability. The summation of pulse heights for 3 rows is
regarded as the energy loss. In this measurement, the drift length was 85 mm

and Ar-CH4 was used. Figure 12 shows the measured mean energy losses for
the 5 particle species measured. Curves of the expected energy losses are also
shown in Fig. 12. Since there was variation in the GEM gain (30% peak to
peak), corrections were applied to the measured values of the energy losses to
match the energy loss of pions with the value calculated at each momentum.
The gain variation of the GEM may be due to the change of the atmospheric
pressure p and the temperature T because the GEM gain strongly depends on
p/T [19]. Unfortunately, the atmospheric pressure and the temperature were
not monitored during the performance test. Another candidate as a reason for
the gain variation is the charging-up of the insulator of a GEM foil [22].

To estimate the particle identiﬁcation capability of a large GEM-TPC, a
Monte-Carlo simulation was performed using measured energy loss spectra
for 1-GeV/c pions and protons. To improve the energy resolution, a truncated

moved, was used. Energy resolution of pions will be 9% and the pion rejection
factor with 99% proton eﬃciency is expected to be 200 with a 50-cm track
length. This energy resolution is comparable with that of the STAR TPC (8%)
with a track length of more than 67 cm [17].

5 Conclusion

A GEM-TPC prototype was constructed to develop a tracking detector for use
in high event rate and high particle multiplicity environments in high energy
heavy ion collisions.

To evaluate the performance of the GEM-TPC, a beam test was performed
99.3% was achieved with 3 kinds of gases,
at KEK. Detection eﬃciency of
Ar(90%)-CH4(10%), Ar(70%)-C2H6(30%) and CF4. Spatial resolution of 79 µm
in the pad row direction and 313 µm in the drift direction was achieved
with Ar-C2H6 and rectangular pads for 13-mm drift. The GEM-TPC showed
high detection eﬃciency and good spatial resolution with a particle rate of
4800 cps/cm2, which exceeds the particle rate of RHIC and the LHC. Energy
loss measurements showed a good particle identiﬁcation capability.

These results indicate that the GEM-TPC meets the requirements for central
tracking detectors for use in the next generation of high energy heavy ion
collision experiments.

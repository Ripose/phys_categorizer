Abstract

The gas gain of single-wire chambers ﬁlled with isobutane, with cell cross-section
12x12 mm and wire diameters of 15, 25, 50 and 100 µm, has been measured at
pressures ranging 12-92 Torr. Contrary to the experience at atmospheric pressure,
at very low pressures the gas gain on thick wires is higher than that on thin wires
at the same applied high voltage as was shown in [1]. Bigger wire diameters should
be used in wire chambers operating at very low pressure if multiple scattering on
wires is not an issue.

Key words: ﬁrst Townsend coeﬃcient, low pressure, gas gain, isobutane

Electric ﬁeld in the cylindrical wire chamber is deﬁned as

where a and b are the wire and cathode radii, and r is the distance from the
wire center. Electric ﬁeld drops very fast with distance from the wire surface
and at normal conditions most gas ampliﬁcation takes place within 3-5 wire
radii. At atmospheric pressure small diameter wire requires much lower applied
high voltage in order to reach the same gas gain as on larger diameter wire.
This is the reason why small diameter wires are used in wire chambers. The

situation changes when gas pressure decreases to the level of a few tens of
Torr. As was recently shown [1], in chambers with the same geometry the gas
gain becomes higher on a thick wire compared to that on a thin wire at the
same applied high voltages.

The present work was done to verify the gas gain on single wire chambers

as a function of wire diameters and gas pressure.

2 Experimental setup

Tests were carried out with single-wire chambers. The chambers have a
cell cross section 12x12 mm and a wire length of about 20 cm. Chambers
are made of aluminum alloy with double sided aluminized mylar on two sides
serving as cathodes. Chambers with wire diameters 15, 25, 50 and 100 µm
have been tested. The chambers were placed in an aluminum vacuum box.
The box was pumped out and ﬁlled with pure iso − C4H10 a few times, and
ﬁnally it was pumped out to the required pressure for the test measurements.
The measurements have been done at pressures of 92, 52, 32 and 12 Torr. The
pressure was monitored with a pressure gauge with a precision of ±1 Torr.
Chambers were irradiated with an 55Fe x-ray source collimated with a 1.6 mm
thick G10 plate with 3 mm hole. This plate was placed directly over the mylar
cathode with the hole close to the cell edge. Signals from the chambers were
self triggered and fed into a LeCroy 2249W ADC, with a gate width of 1 µs
for all tests.

3 Results and discussion

55Fe x-ray photons have energy 5.9 keV (80%) and 6.49 keV (20%). The
x-rays undergo only photoabsorbtion in pure iso − C4H10 at these energies.
The released electrons have a range of about 700-750µm in pure iso − C4H10
at atmospheric pressure. At 92 Torr the range becomes about 6 mm, while it
is about 11 mm, 17 mm and 45 mm at 52, 32 and 12 Torr respectively. At low
pressure, there is a high probability that electrons will leave the 12x12 mm
cell before they lose all their energy. Some of the electrons lose all their energy
within the cell, but do not give a full avalanche if the ionization electrons orig-
inate close to the wire surface. As a result, the measured charge spectrum has
a continuous distribution with a full photoabsorption peak at the high energy
end from the electrons which stop inside of the cell and give a full avalanche.
The total x-ray photoabsorption results in 5.9 keV energy loss inside of
a cell. The average energy required to produce an ion-electron pair in pure
iso − C4H10 is 23 eV [2]. Thus, the photoabsorption of 5.9 keV x-ray photons

results in about 256 electrons in pure iso − C4H10. This number will be used
to calculate the gas gain in the test chambers.

Figure 1 presents charge distributions measured on the 25 µm wire at
pressures of 92, 52 and 32 Torr. Spectra were taken at applied high voltages
of 1150 V, 1000 V and 950 V respectively. Gas gains at these applied voltages
are in the range 9000-13500. As mentioned earlier the spectra have continu-
ous distributions with full photoabsorption peaks at the end. The fraction of
events in the photoabsorption peak, and its resolution, drop with decreasing
pressure. All charge distributions were ﬁt with an exponential function to de-
scribe the tail of continuous charge distribution combined with a gaussian for
the photoabsorption peak. The gaussian function gives the photoabsorption
peak center and its sigma. The results of the gaussian ﬁt were used to calculate
the gas gain.

Figure 2 shows the gas gain as a function of applied voltage on all four
tested wires at a gas pressure of 92 Torr. Here and on the next two ﬁgures
the straight lines are exponential ﬁts of experimental points. One can see that
at 92 Torr the thinner wires have higher gas gain at the same applied high
voltage. Resolution is much poorer on the thin wires, which resulted in fewer
points on the 15 µm and 25 µm wires.

15, 25, 50 and 100 µm diameter anode wires. Chambers are ﬁlled

The straight lines represent exponential ﬁts of experimental points.

At a pressure of 52 Torr (ﬁg. 3) there are visible changes compared with
92 Torr. The smaller the wire diameter the smaller the slope of gas gain versus
high voltage dependence. At lower voltages, the gain is higher on the 15 µm
wire compared with that on the 25 µm wire. Above 1000 V, gain on the 15 µm
becomes equal or even lower than on the 25 µm wire and even approaches that
on the 50 µm wire.

Figure 4 depicts gas gains on the tested wires at a pressure of 32 Torr.
Resolution becomes very poor here, especially for the 15 and 25 µm wires. As
in the two previous cases, the gas gain is higher on thinner wires at low volt-
ages, but that changes very quickly. At 900 V gains on the 15, 25 and 50 µm
are already equal and eventually reverse the order compared with higher pres-
sure. Above 1050 V the gain on the 100 µm wire almost reaches that on the
15 µm wire.

at 52 Torr pressure. Note that gas gain of 15 µm wire is nearly the
same as for 25 µm wire at ˜1050 V.

Further lowering of pressure results in very poor resolution and the full
absorption peak disappears. At 12 Torr, charge spectra have been taken on
all four wires with 800 V applied voltage. Spectra were presented in [1] and
are shown here in ﬁg.5. There are no indications of full absorption peaks on
any wires. The edges of the charge distributions do indicate gas gain on each
wire. One can see that at 12 Torr and 800 V the gas gains are higher on the
bigger diameter wires.

Data taken at low pressure showed that for a given wire diameter, the
resolution of the photoabsorption peak degrades with increasing high voltage
and decreasing gas pressure. Thin wire has worse resolution at the same pres-
sure and applied high voltage compared to thick wire.

In [1] an electric ﬁeld Em was introduce where electrons gain enough
energy to ionize atoms over the mean free path λm, i.e. eEmλm = I0, where
λm = 1/nσ [3]. Here I0 is the gas ionization potential, σ is the total cross

section for electron collision with atoms, n is the density of gas atoms, e is
the electron charge. Above this electric ﬁeld strength the ﬁrst Townsend co-
eﬃcient has very weak dependence on electric ﬁeld and is deﬁned mainly by
the electron’s mean free path.

One can understand the gas gain behaviour, shown in ﬁg.5, by looking at
the reduced electric ﬁeld strength distributions near the wires and taking into
account the behaviour of the ﬁrst Townsend coeﬃcient at high electric ﬁeld,
proposed in [1]. Figure 6 shows the reduced electric ﬁelds of all four tested
wires as a function of distance from the wire surfaces. Pressure is 12 Torr and
800 V is applied to each chamber. The critical reduced electric ﬁeld for pure
iso−C4H10, where the avalanche starts, has been estimated using data from [4]
and found to be Sc ≃ 86 V /cm · T orr. Electric ﬁeld Em for pure iso − C4H10

and 10.8 eV an ionization potential [2], is estimated to be Em ≈ 4.65 kV /cm.
These values of Sc and the reduced ﬁeld Sm = Em/P ≈ 390 V /cm · T orr are
shown as well. The avalanches start farther from the surfaces of thick wires.
Everywhere at ﬁeld S < Sm thicker wires have higher reduced electric ﬁeld
that results in a higher ﬁrst Townsend coeﬃcient. Beyond reduced ﬁeld Sm
the ﬁrst Townsend coeﬃcient has very weak dependence on electric ﬁeld and
stays practically the same for all wires even though the thinner wires have
much higher electric ﬁeld there. Such a behaviour results in higher total gas
gain on thicker wires.

The poor energy resolution in our measurements was primarily caused
by the small cell size (12x12 mm cross section) of the single wire chambers
which were used in the test measurements. One would need to use chambers
with bigger cell size to improve resolution.

It is interesting to notice from the comparison of ﬁg.2-4 that saturation
is visible only on 50 and 100 µm wires at pressure 92 Torr. The highest gain
there is about 3·105 which corresponds to a collected charge of about 12 pC.
The reason for this is that photoelectrons released by 55Fe x-rays have much
longer range at low pressure and many avalanches are distributed along the
wire. Recall, that at atmospheric pressure, saturation starts when the total
charge in the avalanche exceeds ≈ 1 pC.

4 Conclusion

We have measured gas gain on 15, 25, 50 and 100 µm diameter wires in
single-wire chambers ﬁlled with pure iso − C4H10 at pressures in the range
12-92 Torr. Our results clearly demonstrate that at low pressures, gas gain
becomes higher on thick wires than on thinner wires, in wire chambers having
the same geometry and applied high voltage. The gas gain versus high voltage
dependence slopes are smaller on the smaller diameter wires at low pressure.
This is a consequence of the fact that at high electric ﬁeld strength the ﬁrst
Townsend coeﬃcient is limited by the electron’s mean free path.

Bigger wire diameters should be used in wire chambers operating at very
low gas pressures where scattering on the wires is not an issue. Speciﬁc rec-
ommendations should be addressed for each gas and chamber geometry. Op-
erating voltage (i.e. gas gain) should be taken into account as well because the

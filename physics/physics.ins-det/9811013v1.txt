Abstract

In order to study photomultiplier’s short-term gain stability at high counting rate,
we constructed an LED pulsed light source and its output monitor system. For the
monitor system, we employed a photon counting method using a photomultiplier
as a monitor photon detector. It is found that the method oﬀers a simple way to
monitor outputs from a pulsed light source and that, together with an LED light
source, it provides a handy way to investigate photomultiplier’s rate eﬀects.

multiplier’s gain has been a well-known phenomenon [1], which poses one of
the major problems to realize good detector performance. For photomultipli-
ers used in our trigger counter [2], stability was one of the major concerns.
Roughly speaking, gain stability within ±10% was required up to the counting
rate of a few MHz. More detailed accounts will be given in §4.2.

In order to investigate photomultiplier’s gain change, a stable pulsed light
source and/or an output light monitor system were needed. Considering pulse
rate involved and handiness, the only light source available was LED. How-
ever, LED light outputs might vary substantially at a repetition rate of a MHz
region. This motivated us to develop a light monitor system, which was suit-
able to a pulsed light source lit at the repetition rate of MHz or higher. Needed
accuracy for our particular application was a few %. We employed a photon
counting method for this purpose. We describe the results of studies on the
LED light source and its monitor system in the following sections. This report
is organized as follows: in §2 the principle of the photon counting method is
described. The experimental setup and the results of test measurements are
shown in §3 and §4, respectively. The section 5 summarizes our studies.

2 Principle of the Method

Fig.1 shows a schematic diagram which illustrates our method. A photomul-
tiplier under test, placed in front of a pulsed LED, receives most of the light
output. We sample a very small portion of the lights and inject it to a monitor
photon detector. Let ηsamp denotes the sampling fraction of photons; it mainly
depends on geometrical factors such as the distance between the light source
and detector, and, if exist, an aperture and attenuation ﬁlters between them.
We regard this fraction to be practically constant during the course of a mea-
surement. The expected number of photons per pulse detected by the monitor

2

detector is given by hni = hNLEDi · ηsamp · ηdet, where hNLEDi represents the
average number of photons per pulse emitted by LED, and ηdet the monitor’s
detection eﬃciency. The probability distribution for n is given by the Poisson
distribution. In this method we adjust hni, the average number of photons per
pulse, to be much less than unity. This can be done at will by changing, for
example, aperture size or attenuation ﬁlters. Since the probability to detect
one or more photons per pulse is given by

P (n ≥ 1) = 1 − e−hni,

hni can be represented by

hni = − log{1 − P (n ≥ 1)}.

We can monitor hni by measuring P (n ≥ 1), and thus the average LED light
output assuming ηsamp ·ηdet to be constant. Here an important feature required
for the monitor photon detector is capability of discriminating the single pho-
ton signal from background noise. In our actual setup we used a photomulti-
plier as a monitor detector. As described in the following section in detail, we
could distinguish clearly a single photoelectron peak from a pedestal[3]. We
measured the counts in which outputs from the monitor photomultiplier ex-
ceeded some prescribed level set between the pedestal and single photoelectron
peak. Then P (n ≥ 1) was given by the counts divided by the total number of
pulses which triggered the LED light source.

The principal advantages of the method are the followings:

(i) As long as the single photon signal can be discriminated from background
noise, small gain variation of a monitor photon detector itself has almost
no eﬀect on P (n ≥ 1) and thus hni. This is the most important feature in
this method. By contrast, if hni is much bigger than one and the monitor
photon detector measures the light output every pulse, it is not possible to
distinguish the change in the LED output itself from the gain variation in
the monitor detector.

(ii) If the peak corresponding to the single photon can be observed, the gain
change may be monitored by measuring its peak position. This feature is
helpful to demonstrate reliability in the monitor detector.

(iii) The monitor detector must be able to discriminate the single photon
from background noise, as mentioned above. However, it is not necessary
to resolve single photon from two (or more) photons since the measured
quantity is P (n ≥ 1). This lessens requirement for the monitor detector.
(iv) The actual counting rate for the monitor detector can be set low by
adjusting hni to be much less than unity. We note that monitor detectors
are usually more stable at lower counting rates for a ﬁxed gain.

Disadvantages of the method, on the other hand, are that it monitors not
instantaneous but average light outputs, and that it takes rather long time to
obtain enough statistical accuracy. For example, when an LED is lit at 10 kHz
and hni is ∼ 0.01, then it takes 100 sec to obtain 104 counts, the number of
counts needed to reach the statistical accuracy of 1 %. It is expected that main
source of the systematic errors for the method stems from various backgrounds
to the monitor photon detector. It turns out that thermal noises and after-
pulses are the two major backgrounds when a photomultiplier is used as a
monitor photon detector. We thus studied these backgrounds carefully (see
below for the detail).

3 Experimental Setup

As shown in Fig.2, the system consisted of a light source, a quartz ﬁber for
photon sampling, a monitor photon detector, and a trigger and read-out elec-
tronic system. A photomultiplier subject to rate eﬀect studies was placed in
front of the light source. A brief description of each component is given below.

3.1 Pulsed light source (LED)

We used a ‘blue’ LED [4] as a light source. For the present application, it
was found advantageous to use blue in two respects. First, the tail of its light
output was substantially shorter(∼20 nsec) than that of a ‘green’ LED (∼50
nsec) [5] [6]. Secondly, the emission spectrum of the blue LED resembled more

4

to that of the scintillator we used; a desirable property for the photomultiplier
gain test.

Fig. 3 shows the LED driver circuit. The circuit provided a constant charge
to the LED stored in the capacitor CLED. The discharge was triggered by a
diﬀerential switch, which in turn initiated by an external NIM pulse. After
the discharge, the capacitor CLED was recharged by an external power supply
with the charge-up time constant τ of 0.1 µsec.

3.2 Trigger and read-out system

A variable frequency NIM clock generator was used to produce a master pulse.
Its output was fed to the LED driver and to a scaler. Output signals from
the monitor photon detector, a photomultiplier for the present case, were
discriminated and fed into a coincidence circuit. We set the discriminator
threshold level at about 1/4 of the single photoelectron peak. The coincidence
signal of the discriminator output and the master clock produced a 60-nsec-
long gate to a charge sensitive ADC, which integrated the raw signal from the
monitor photon detector. The gate signal was also counted by another scaler.
Data from the ADC and scalers were read by a computer via a CAMAC
system.

3.3 Monitor photon detector

As stated, we used a photomultiplier as a monitor photon detector. Selection
of an actual photomultiplier was made by considering (i) single-photoelectron
resolution, (ii) thermal noise rate, and (iii) after-pulse rate. We tested the
following types of photomultipliers; Hamamatsu R329, R1332, R2165 and
R3234 [7]. It was found that backgrounds due to the after-pulse depended
strongly upon photomultiplier types, and that, for some of them, they were
the source of the most serious systematic errors. We ﬁnally chose R3234 from
those listed above with an emphasis on this point.

3.3.0.1 Single-photoelectron resolution Fig.4 shows the pulse height
spectrum obtained with the photomultiplier actually used; the left peak (scaled
oﬀ) corresponds to a pedestal and the right to the single photoelectron. We
deﬁned a signal count as an event above a software cut placed at the bottom
of the valley on this spectrum. The actual cut position was 0.4 in units of
the single photoelectron, i.e. the ADC counts between the pedestal and single
photoelectron peak. It was conﬁrmed that variation of the cut position within
a reasonable range from the nominal value resulted a negligible change in the
ﬁnal results [8].

3.3.0.2 Thermal noise Thermal (random) noises may contribute to a
systematic error. We measured the noise rate and found it to be ∼ 400 Hz
at 15 ◦C. The background count per pulse is then ∼400 Hz×60 nsec (ADC
gate width) = 2.4 × 10−5. This should be compared with an average signal
rate of hni. The background is thus severe at small hni; however, it is possible
to adjust ηsamp so that hni is much larger than the noise contribution. In our
actual measurements ( see §4.2 for an example ), the lowest value for hni was
chosen to be 0.006. Thus the error due to this noise is negligible (< 1%) [9].

3.3.0.3 After-pulse An after-pulse is a spurious pulse induced in a pho-
tomultiplier by previous pulses [10]. It is induced by positive ion hits on a
photocathode which is produced by collisions between electrons and residual
gas molecules in the tube. Since original electron currents are initiated by in-
put light, the after-pulse has time and rate correlation with the input light.
Let’s denote by αa.p the average number of after-pulses per input light which
emits single photoelectron. Then, in the worst case, namely when the after-
pulse happens to have a complete time correlation with the following signal
pulse, hni would increase to hni (1 + αa.p). Thus the only way to reduce this
error is to choose a photomultiplier with small αa.p.

In order to ﬁnd an appropriate photomultiplier, we measured this quantity
αa.p. The measurement was done with the same setup shown in Fig.2 with
one minor change; the delay generator started the gate pulse about 200 nsec
after the LED light pulse. The gate width determined the time interval to look
for the after-pulses. The results are shown in Fig.5 for the photomultiplier we
selected (R3234), together with another type of 2-inch photomultiplier (R2165)
for comparison. In the ﬁgures, the abscissa represents the integration period
(the gate width) while the ordinate represents the after-pulse probability αa.p.
As can be seen, the integrated counts saturate around the gate width of 10
µsec. From the results above and similar measurements for the other types of
photomultipliers listed above, we concluded that the integration time of 128
µsec was long enough to detect practically all the after-pulses. The selected
photomultiplier R3234 has particularly small value (αa.p ∼ 0.001) [11]. We
thus expect the error due to this background is also negligible.

4 Results of Test Measurements

4.1 Cross-check measurement

It is diﬃcult to determine the absolute accuracy of this method experimentally
since there is no ‘ideal’ light source to calibrate with. Nevertheless we wanted
to obtain a crude ‘estimate’ of its accuracy, and thus compared it with one
other method.

In place of a test photomultiplier, we set an R329 photomultiplier operated in
a diode mode. This was accomplished by keeping the cathode at -300 V while
all the other dynodes grounded. The average cathode current was measured
by an ampliﬁer and a current monitor. Since there was no electron multiplica-
tion involved, the output current was expected to be proportional to the input
light even at high rate. At low rate, however, the output was dominated by
electronic noise, and the measurement became less accurate. Actually we mea-
sured the output current produced by the LED light pulse at the repetition
rate between 0.7 MHz and 5 MHz [12]. The measured values of the current
from R329 were converted to the charge per pulse and then normalized to
that at 0.7 MHz. The resultant quantities, namely the normalized LED light
outputs per pulse as a function of pulse rate, are displayed in Fig.6, together
with the corresponding quantities obtained with the photon counting method.
As seen, they agree fairly well with each other up to 5 MHz. The maximum
deviation is found to be about 7%. The origin of the discrepancy is not clear
at present [13].

4.2 Example of the stability measurement

In this subsection, we show an example of the gain stability measurement
performed with this system. The photomultipliers under test were used in the
trigger counter in our experiment [2]. Their short-term stability was one of
the major concerns because of the following reasons. The trigger counter was
composed of a set of plastic scintillator slabs and was installed in an intense
neutral K beam. Scintillation lights from the counter were read by photomul-
tipliers attached at the both ends of the scintillators. We chose Hamamatsu
R1398[7], a photomultiplier with a bialkali photocathode which had a spectral
response well matched with an emission spectrum of the scintillator, and a
linear focused dynode chain which provided a fast rise time and a good pulse
linearity. These properties, together with its cathode diameter (1-1/8′′), were
well suited to our application. We used an AC-coupled preampliﬁer and base-
line restorer as a part of the read-out circuit. The preampliﬁer (with ∼ 30
db gain) helped to reduce photomultiplier’s average anode current while the
base-line restorer compensated base-line shifts at high counting rate. If the
photomultiplier gains were to be set high to compensate possible gain drop
at high counting rate, hit rates would increase by background particles such
as neutrons and gammas in the beam. For our experiment (KL rare decay),
these background hits should be avoided as much as possible to reduce trigger
rates and to ensure high reconstruction eﬃciency in oﬀ-line analysis. In addi-
tion a large pulse would tend to cause a longer dead time for a preampliﬁer
due to saturation, making the counter ineﬃcient. As a consequence the pho-
tomultiplier gain should be kept as low as practical while maintaining ∼ 100%
eﬃciency for the minimum ionizing particles. This demanded good gain stabil-
ity (say relative gain change within ±10% ) at the expected highest counting
rate ( i.e., ∼ 4 MHz for each photomultiplier).

Fig.7 shows the result for the R1398 type photomultiplier. It shows the R1398
output divided by hni as a function of the LED pulse rate; the ratio is then
rescaled to 1 at 86 kHz. In the measurement, the LED light intensity on R1398
was adjusted to give approximately 100 photoelectrons per pulse independent
of the pulse rate, which was approximately equal to the average scintillator
light output produced by minimum ionizing particles passing through our
trigger counter. We accomplished this by pulsing 7 identical LEDs in turn, thus
keeping the eﬀective pulse rate for any individual LED less than 1 MHz [14].
The maximum deviation of the normalized R1398 output from the unity is
found to be about 3% in the rage from 86 kHz to 5 MHz. Thus we concluded
the photomultiplier, combined with the base used, met our requirements.

We note that the two of the photomultipliers, R3234 (the monitor photon
detector) and R1398, ‘see’ quite diﬀerent photons; the former sees mostly
single photons with relatively low rates while the latter sees much more intense

9

photons with a rate up to 5 MHz. Thus an accidental cancellation of systematic
errors is expected to be uncommon. The result in turn gives good conﬁdence
to the monitoring method.

5 Summary and Discussion

In order to study photomultiplier’s gain stability at high counting rate, we
constructed an LED pulsed light source and its output monitor system. For
the monitor system, we employed a photon counting method. It samples a
small portion of light output and measures single photon rates with a monitor
photon detector. It thus monitors the relative light output from the source.
It is virtually insensitive to the gain change of a monitor photon detector
because, as long as the discrimination between the signal from background
noise is clear, the rate of the single photon count remains constant.

In our actual setup, we used a photomultiplier as a monitor photon detector.
Thermal (random) noises and after-pulses were found to be the two main
backgrounds. We could make the errors due to these backgrounds suﬃciently
small (< 1%) by selecting a suitable photomultiplier and a operating condition.
We tentatively assign ∼ 7% as an absolute accuracy in this method. This
accuracy was estimated by the method described in §4.1.

Our direct application of this system was to investigate the gain stability of
the photomultiplier (R1398) used in our trigger counter. As shown in §4.2, it
was proved that the photomultiplier and base system could satisfy our require-
ments. At the same time, it is found that the photon counting method oﬀers

10

a simple way to monitor outputs from a pulsed light source. Together with
an LED light source, it provides a handy way to investigate photomultiplier’s
gain stability at high counting rates.

In order to illustrate the eﬀect of the change in the cut position, we take a
measurement described in §4.1 as an example. The maximum change in the
normalized photomultiplier gain (i.e. the gain rescaled to 1 at 0.7 MHz) was
found to be less than 0.7% when the cut position was varied between 0.3 and
0.5.

[9] The exception was the cross-check measurement described in §4.1. See also

[11] We expect that the after-pulse rate depends on, among other things, residual
gas pressure of photomultiplier tubes. This means that the quantity αa.p varies
from one tube to another within one type of photomultipliers. (In general, old
tubes have bigger αa.p due to the increase of residual gas in tubes.) Since the
history of the tested tubes was not quite known and the number was limited
(1 ∼ 3 tubes), the selected photomultiplier type may not mean the best type
in general. In principle, αa.p may depend on photomultiplier’s gain (HV), too.
However, very little dependence on the HV was found.

[12] As can be seen from the results, the light output from the LED decreased
with the repetition rate. A part of the reason could be the long charge-up time
constant for the LED capacitor CLED (1/τ ∼ 9 MHz). We left it as it was,

12

because we thought it desirable to keep the average cathode current of R239
roughly constant independent of the pulse rate.

[13] For this measurement, the smallest hni was 0.0001 (at 5 MHz). Thus the thermal
noise contribution could be as large as 2.4%. If this was the only source of
discrepancy between the two sets of the measurement, the discrepancy should
become larger as hni decreased. We did not see such behavior; thus we concluded
that the thermal noise was not, at least, the main source of the discrepancy.

[14] As can be seen from ﬁg.6 the LED light output was roughly constant below 2

MHz.

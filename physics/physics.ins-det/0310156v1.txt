Two MiniPlug calorimeters, designed to measure the energy and lateral position of particles in the pseudora-
pidity region of 3.6 < |η| < 5.1 of the CDF detector, have been installed as part of the Run II CDF upgrade at
the Tevatron collider. Detector performance and ﬁrst results from ¯pp collision data are presented.

The tower design is based on an hexagon ge-
ometry. Holes in the lead plate are conceptually
grouped in hexagons, each with six holes. The
six ﬁbers inserted in the holes of a hexagon are
grouped together and are viewed by one MCPMT
channel. A seventh ﬁber, which is clear and car-

1. INTRODUCTION

The CDF diﬀractive physics program relies on
two MiniPlug (MP) calorimeters, which can de-
tect both charged and neutral particles, to mea-
sure the event energy ﬂow in the very forward
rapidity region on opposite sides of the interac-
tion point. The performance of a MP prototype
is published in [1], while the ﬁnal detector assem-
bly and the results from a cosmic ray test are
reported in [2].

2. DETECTOR

The MPs consist of alternating layers of lead
plates and liquid scintillator read out by Wave-
Length Shifting (WLS) ﬁbers (Fig. 1). The ﬁbers
are perpendicular to the lead plates and par-
allel to the proton/antiproton beams, and are
read out by Multi-Channel PhotoMultiplier Tubes
(MCPMTs). The 16-channel Hamamatsu R5900
MCPMTs have a quartz window which improves
the radiation hardness. Each MP is housed in a
cylindrical steel vessel 26′′ in diameter and has
a 5′′ hole concentric with the vessel to accom-
modate the beam pipe. The depth of a MP is
32 radiation lengths and 1.3 interaction lengths.
The short hadronic depth limits the lateral spread
of the showers. The MPs have a novel towerless
geometry with no dead regions, due to the lack
of internal boundaries, and towers are formed by
combining the desired number of ﬁbers. The cen-
troid of the tower pulse height provides the posi-

ries the light from a calibration LED, is also read
out by each MCPMT pixel to allow a periodi-
cal monitoring of the MCPMT response. The
MCPMT outputs are added to form 84 calorime-
ter towers per MP, organized in four concentric

rings around the beam pipe. The entire MCPMT
can also be read out through the last dynode out-
put to provide trigger information. Each MP has
a total of 18 trigger towers, arranged in three
rings.

3. CALIBRATION AND RUN II DATA

Cosmic ray muons were used to test one 60o
wedge of the east MP. The cosmic ray trigger ﬁred
on a 2-fold coincidence of scintillation counter
paddles located on top and at the bottom of the
MP vessel, placed with towers pointing upward.
The single photoelectron response was measured
using a randomly gated signal from a 60Co source.
The response to a minimum ionizing particle was
found to be above 100 photoelectrons, exceeding
the design speciﬁcations.

Although a precise energy calibration is not
crucial to the analysis of diﬀractive processes, an
attempt was made to estimate the energy of jets
and particles using colliding beam data from Run
II. For each tower, the ADC count distribution
of a sample of minimum bias events can be ﬁt-
ted well by a falling exponential curve (Fig. 2,
top). A Monte Carlo simulation was then used
to calibrate the pseudorapidity dependence of the
tower-by-tower response. Due to pile-up eﬀects at
larger rapidity regions, a luminosity dependence
of the ADC count distribution slope is observed
(Fig. 2, bottom). A linear ﬁt describes well the
data, with the slope decreasing with increasing
values of instantaneous luminosity. The particle
multiplicity is measured by counting clusters of
towers with energy above noise (Fig. 3).

The MPs are presently an integral part of the
CDF detector, collecting good quality data for
further exploring the realm of diﬀractive physics.

Abstract

We present pulse height measurements in drift chambers operated with Xe,CO2 gas
mixtures. We investigate the attachment of primary electrons on oxygen and SF6
contaminants in the detection gas. The measurements are compared with simula-
tions of properties of drifting electrons. We present two methods to check the gas
quality: gas chromatography and 55Fe pulse height measurements using monitor
detectors.

1 Introduction

The ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) [1] has to provide both
electron identiﬁcation and particle tracking. To achieve this, accurate pulse
height measurement in drift chambers operated with Xe,CO2(15%) gas mix-
ture over the drift time of the order of 2 µs (spanning 3 cm of drift length) is
a necessary requirement. For such precision measurements, it is of particular
importance not to loose charge by electron attachment, i.e. the absorption of
drifting electrons by electronegative molecules present in the detector gas as
contaminants. The large volume (28 m3) of the ALICE TRD and the high
cost of xenon make the above arguments very serious for the operation of the
ﬁnal detector.

Attachment is a well studied and generally understood phenomenon, both fun-
damentally [2,3] and concerning its practical implications for gas drift cham-
bers [4]. For electron energies relevant to gaseous detectors (energies below
a few eV), attachment occurs mainly via two mechanisms: resonance cap-
ture and dissociative capture. Resonance capture, also called Bloch-Bradbury
mechanism [5], has the largest cross-section. It can be written as:

I + e− → I −∗

I −∗ + S → I − + S∗.

(1)

(2)

I denotes the impurity and S is a third body stabilizer, which in case of
gas detectors, is usually the quencher. The star (∗) denotes a vibrationally
excited state. Besides decaying by the resonant energy transfer (2), I −∗ could
also decay by electron emission (autodetachment), in which case there is no
signal loss. The rate of process (2), and thus the magnitude of attachment,
depends on the concentration of S and on the lifetime of the excited state
I −∗. Also, as a result of diﬀerent vibrational levels available for the energy
transfer (2), the attachment depends on the type of quencher [4,6]. An excess
of electron attachment with respect to the Bloch-Bradbury mechanism has
been identiﬁed and assigned to van der Waals complexes [7].

The most common electronegative molecule is O2, present in gaseous detec-
tors as a residual contaminant in the gas supply or from the atmosphere due
to imperfect tightness of the system. Attachment on O2 has been extensively
studied for Ar-based mixtures in ranges of parameters relevant for drift cham-
bers [4,6]. Another common contaminant in gas detectors is H2O, usually
outgassed by assembly materials, and often appreciated as an ageing-limiting

agent [8]. It has been found that, for certain Ar-based mixtures, attachment
on H2O alone is negligible, but a few hundred ppm of H2O can double the
attachment coeﬃcient on O2 [4].

In one of our early measurements with TRD prototype chambers operated
with Xe,CH4(10%) we observed electron attachment under very low contam-
ination levels of O2 and H2O. As that particular gas supply was exhausted
during the measurements, we were not able to analyze it and so not able
to attribute the attachment to a deﬁned impurity. Subsequent measurements
(performed with a new supply of Xe) proved to be free of visible attachment.
However, recent observation of strong attachment, this time with the mixture
Xe,CO2(15%) forced us to investigate the issue in more detail. We have been
able to identify the impurity responsible for attachment: sulphur hexaﬂuoride,
SF6, which was found to be present at the ppm level in a xenon supply. This
heavy gas, well known for its excellent insulating properties, has an extremely
large cross section for electron attachment at low electron energies. We note
that pulse height distributions as a function of drift time were measured before
in drift chambers with Xe-based mixtures, also related to TRDs [9,10,11,12].
A decrease of the average pulse height as a function of drift time was observed
in all these cases and it was attributed to electron attachment [12], but not
quantitatively understood.

Here we report on measurements performed during prototype tests of the
ALICE TRD [1]. Drift chambers operated with Xe,CO2 mixtures are investi-
gated. The experimental setup and method of data analysis are described in
the next section. We then present measurements under clean conditions (no
attachment). The following sections contain our measurements of attachment
on oxygen and on SF6. We compare our results with simulations of charge
transport for various gas mixtures. We present gas quality checks employ-
ing gas chromatograph analyses and 55Fe measurements using especially-built
monitoring detectors.

2 Experimental setup

Most of the results are obtained using prototype drift chambers (DC) with a
construction similar to that anticipated for the ﬁnal ALICE TRD [1], but with
a smaller active area (25×32 cm2). In Fig. 1 we present a schematic view of
the detector. The DC has a drift region of 30 mm and an ampliﬁcation region
of 7 mm. The anode wires (W-Au, 20 µm diameter) have a pitch of 5 mm.
For the cathode wires (Cu-Be, 75 µm diameter) we use a pitch of 2.5 mm. We
read out the signal on a segmented cathode plane. The pads (of 6 cm2 each)
have either chevron [13] or rectangular shape. The entrance window (25 µm
aluminized Kapton) simultaneously serves as gas barrier and as drift electrode.

A charge-sensitive preampliﬁer/shaper (PASA) was especially designed and
built (with discrete components) for the purpose of prototype tests. It has
a gain of 2 mV/fC and noise of about 1800 electrons r.m.s. The FWHM of
the output pulse is about 100 ns for an input step function. For the read-
out of the DC we use an 8-bit non-linear Flash ADC (FADC) system with
100 MHz sampling frequency, 0.6 V voltage swing and adjustable baseline.
The FADC sampling was rebinned in the oﬀ-line analysis in order to resemble
the performance of the ﬁnal detector [1]. The data acquisition (DAQ) is based
on a VME event builder and was developed at GSI Darmstadt [14]. As the
beam diameter is of the order of a few cm, we usually limit the readout of the
DC to 8 pads. This also minimizes data transfer on the VSB bus connecting
the FADC and the event builder.

The measurements were carried out at beam momenta of 1 GeV/c at GSI
Darmstadt [15] and 3 GeV/c at the CERN PS [16]. The beams were mixtures
of electrons and negative pions. For the present analysis we have selected clean
samples of pions using coincident upper thresholds on a Cherenkov detector
and on a lead glass calorimeter (see ref. [17] for details). To minimize the eﬀect
of space charge on the pulse height measurement, which occurs for tracks at
normal incidence to the anode wires (for which all charge collection takes place
at a narrow spot on the anode wire), we adjusted the angle of incidence of the
beam to about 15◦ with respect to the normal incidence to the anode wires.
A particle trajectory through the detector is sketched in Fig. 1.

The standard gas mixture for our detectors is Xe,CO2(15%) at 1 mbar above

4

atmospheric pressure. The continuous ﬂow of gas through the detectors is ei-
ther vented out or recirculated via our gas system. The detectors are usually
operated at gas gains around 8000. Our standard supply of xenon is from
Messer-Griesheim [18] and proved to provide a very good detector perfor-
mance. We have also used xenon from Linde [19], which provided a strikingly
poor signal at ﬁrst examination. SF6 was detected early on with gas chro-
matography techniques in this xenon supply, and its concentration was mea-
sured to be of the order of 1 ppm. Both xenon supplies were used in beam
measurements reported on below.

3 Measurements under clean conditions

For these measurements we use SF6-free xenon. The oxygen content in the gas
was continuously monitored and kept below 10 ppm using a ﬂow of 2-3 liters
of fresh gas per hour into two chambers of about 9 liters total volume. The
water content was about 150 ppm.

Distributions of average pulse height, hP Hi, as a function of drift time for
diﬀerent drift voltages are shown in Fig. 2 for pions of 1 GeV/c momentum.
The detector gas is our standard mixture, Xe,CO2(15%). The time zero has
been arbitrarily shifted by about 0.3 µs to have a measurement of the base-
line and of noise. Similar distributions have been measured for the mixture
Xe,CO2(20%).

The primary electrons from ionization energy loss of pions drift towards the
anode wire, where they are ampliﬁed. The signal (charge induced on the pads)
is determined mainly by the slow-moving ions, producing long tails in the
PASA output. The overlap of these tails, convoluted with the response of the
preampliﬁer, results in a slightly rising average pulse height as a function of the
drift time, as seen in Fig. 2. The peak at short drift times originates from the
primary clusters generated in the ampliﬁcation region, where the ionization
from both sides of the anode wires contributes to the same time interval. Note
that, for the present conditions, lower values of drift ﬁeld imply smaller drift
velocity (see Fig. 7 in section 6), leading to a stretching of the signal over
longer drift times. Our measurements established for the ﬁrst time [17] the
expected time evolution of the signal in drift chambers of the type studied
here.

4 Attachment on oxygen

Again, for these measurements we use clean (SF6-free) xenon. In Fig. 3 we
show the average pulse height distributions as a function of drift time for
diﬀerent values of the oxygen content in the range of a few hundred ppm. A
decrease of the signal as a function of drift time is seen when the concentration
of oxygen increases. This is a clear indication of electron attachment. Notice
that the signal in the ampliﬁcation region, where electrons drift very little, is
aﬀected to a much smaller extent.

In case of attachment, the number of electrons (and the corresponding mea-
sured pulse height) decreases exponentially as a function of drift time, t:

N(t) = N(0) · e−A·t,

where A is the attachment rate [4]. At a given gas pressure, p (which is the
atmospheric pressure in our case), the attachment rate depends linearly on the
concentration (partial pressure) of the impurity responsible for attachment, pI,
and can be factorized [4] as:

A = p · pI · CI,

where CI is the attachment coeﬃcient of the impurity I.

From the above measurements of pulse height distributions as a function of
drift time we deduce, for the present value of the drift ﬁeld of 0.77 kV/cm, an
attachment coeﬃcient on O2, CO2=400 bar−2µs−1. This value is very similar
to values measured for Ar,CO2 mixtures with comparable CO2 content [6]
and more than an order or magnitude larger than values measured for Ar,CH4
mixtures [4]. Given the short drift time in our detectors, attachment on oxygen
does not impose any severe constraint on the tightness of the drift chambers
for the ﬁnal detector.

5 Attachment on SF6

All the measurements presented below have been carried out with pions of
3 GeV/c momentum, using Linde xenon with 1.1 ppm SF6 contamination.
For these measurements the O2 and H2O contamination was 150 ppm and
400 ppm, respectively. These rather large values arise because, due to the
contamination of the xenon, the gas was vented and not recirculated (and, as
a consequence, not ﬁltered), as usual, through our gas system.

In Fig. 4 we show the average pulse height distributions as a function of
drift time for diﬀerent values of the drift ﬁeld for the standard gas mixture,
Xe,CO2(15%). Beyond the decrease of the pulse height due to longer drift
times for lower drift ﬁelds, there is obviously a dramatic loss of signal due to
electron attachment. The relative loss of signal is most pronounced between
the two highest values of the drift ﬁeld, for which the variation of the drift
velocity is very small. At drift ﬁelds higher than 1 kV/cm, the plateau of
the average pulse height in the drift region starts to recover. This trend is
explained by the fact that the energy of the drifting electrons increases with
the electric ﬁeld and, therefore, the attachment coeﬃcient of the SF6-polluted

The eﬀect of diﬀerent CO2 concentrations on the attachment eﬃciency of the
contaminated xenon has also been investigated. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the
average pulse height distributions for 10% and 5% CO2, respectively. The gas
gains were not identical for the three concentrations of CO2, so the corre-
sponding distributions can only be compared on a relative basis. Notice that,
for the same drift ﬁeld, the extension of the signal in time is diﬀerent for dif-

ferent concentrations of CO2 because of diﬀerent drift velocities (see Fig. 7
in the next section). The signal loss due to electron attachment decreases for
lower CO2 concentrations. For the Xe,CO2(5%) mixture, the pulse height dis-
tribution almost completely recovers at the highest electric ﬁeld studied here.
As we discuss in the next section, the variation of attachment as a function
of quencher concentration is due to the dependence of the average energy of
drifting electrons on the CO2 content.

6 Comparison to calculations

To understand the measurements presented above, we have performed calcula-
tions using the packages GARFIELD [20], MAGBOLTZ [21] and HEED [22].
In Fig. 7 we present the calculated drift velocities for 5%, 10% and 15% of
CO2 admixture in Xe. The dotted vertical lines mark the values of the electric
ﬁeld used for the measurements of attachment on SF6. The solid vertical line
segments indicate the electric ﬁelds used for measurements under clean con-
ditions (Fig. 2 in section 3). All these values are in a region where the drift
velocity has a strong dependence on the drift ﬁeld, a trend reﬂected in the
measurements presented above.

To compare how well the measured pulse height distributions can be re-
produced by simulations, we have calculated the detector signals using the
GARFIELD package, under the exact experimental conditions. The preampli-
ﬁer response has been included in these calculations. The time dependence of
the average pulse height for diﬀerent electric ﬁelds for the clean Xe,CO2(15%)

mixture is presented in Fig. 8. For an easier comparison with the measure-
ments (Fig. 2 in section 3), we introduced a time shift of 0.4 µs for these dis-
tributions. The calculations reproduce the measured signals reasonably well,
although not in all details. The slope of signal increase in the drift region as
a function of drift time is larger for the calculations. This may be an indi-
cation that some residual attachment is still present for the measured data,
possibly as a result of oxygen, water and undetectectable amounts of other

10

m
contaminants. The slightly asymmetric gaussian preampliﬁer response aﬀects
this slope very little. Already before folding the preampliﬁer response the cal-
culated signals show a larger slope than the measured ones. For the lower
values of the drift ﬁeld the calculations are in disagreement with the measure-
ment concerning the time extension of the signal. This discrepancy, reaching
14% for the ﬁeld value of 0.72 kV/cm, may reﬂect a diﬀerent ﬁeld dependence
of the drift velocity in measurements and calculations. We note that a good
agreement was found between calculations and measurements in other Xe-
based mixtures [23,24]. Since the bow of the entrance window (which is also
the drift electrode) due to gas overpressure introduces an obvious uncertainty
in the present measurements, it is too early to assess the above discrepacy
quantitatively. Precision measurements of the drift velocity for the standard
TRD gas mixture Xe,CO2(15%) are in progress.

Figure 9 shows the time dependence of the average pulse height for diﬀerent
electric ﬁelds for the Xe,CO2(15%) mixture with 0.94 ppm of SF6, correspond-
ing to the SF6 fraction in the measurements. For a direct comparison with the
measurements, the time shift is 0.3 µs in this case. The measured attachment
(Fig. 4 in the previous section) is reproduced almost quantitatively, except
for the smoother reduction of attachment towards higher ﬁeld values seen in
the measurements. Not reproduced is the measured stronger variation of the
signal in the ampliﬁcation region.

We turn now to a more detailed investigation of the attachment on SF6. In par-
ticular, the measured drift ﬁeld dependence of the attachment (nicely repro-
duced by simulations) is expected to reﬂect the characteristics of the attach-

ment cross section as a function of electron energy. Indeed, the cross section
of electron attachment on SF6 is large and has a strong energy dependence,
as shown in in Fig. 10 [3]. Resonance capture, which leads to the formation of
SF−
6 , is the most important mechanism, with cross sections up to 8·10−17 m2
for near-zero electron energies. The cross section of dissociative capture, re-
sulting in a free ﬂuorine atom and SF−
5 , peaks at the value of 4·10−20 m2 for
electron energy of about 0.3 eV. These characteristics of attachment cross sec-
tions of SF6 are quite diﬀerent compared to the O2 case [2]. For example, in
case of O2, the cross section for dissociative capture peaks at about 10−22 m2
for electron energy of 6.5 eV [2].

The energy spectra of the drifting electrons for various electric ﬁelds are shown
in Fig. 11 for the mixture Xe,CO2(15%). These distributions are computed
with the simulation program Imonte [21]. A signiﬁcant high-energy component
(energies above 1 eV) is present towards higher ﬁeld values. The average energy
of drifting electrons (also computed with Imonte), ¯ε, is plotted in Fig. 12 as a
function of drift ﬁeld for the three concentrations of CO2 in Xe. The average
energy increases strongly with the electric ﬁeld and is larger for smaller CO2
concentrations. The dotted vertical lines mark the values of the drift ﬁeld used
for the measurements. As the attachment cross section decreases as a function
of the electron energy, the trends seen in Fig. 12 explain both the observed
dependence of attachment on drift ﬁeld and on CO2 concentration mixture.

The concentration of CO2 may inﬂuence the rate of the resonant energy trans-
fer in the second step of the Bloch-Bradbury process (2), but this seems not to

be the case for attachment on SF6. The measured pulse height distributions for
15%, 10% and 5% CO2 (Figs. 4 to 6 in the previous section) for the ﬁeld values
of 1.36, 1.07 and 0.79 kV/cm (for which the corresponding average energies are
similar, see Fig. 12), respectively, look very similar. Although we cannot make
a quantitative statement, apparently all the inﬂuence of CO2 concentration
on the attachment stems from the average energy of the drifting electrons. In
contrast, a dependence of oxygen attachment on quencher content (beyond
electron energy contribution) has been measured for 10% and 20% CH4 in Ar
[4]. This diﬀerence between SF6 and O2 attachment is probably the result of
diﬀerent lifetimes of the corresponding excited states of the negative ions. In-
deed, the autodetachment lifetime is larger than 1 µs for SF∗−
[2], comparable
6
with the drift time in our detectors, whereas for O∗−
it is about 10−4 µs [7].

7 Methods for checking the gas quality

Using xenon supplies as SF6-free as possible is an important requirement. In
the following we describe our monitoring procedures, i.e. gas chromatography
and 55Fe pulse height measurements using dedicated monitor detectors.

Gas chromatography allows the detection and quantiﬁcation of traces of pol-
lutants in a gas, by separating the diﬀerent species contained in the sampled
gas in a chromatograph column, and by detecting them in a suitable detector
placed downstream of the column. The separated eﬄuents give rise to charac-
teristic peaks in a time diagram which can be identiﬁed and quantiﬁed after

13

e
proper calibration of the device. Since SF6 has a high electron capture cross
section, an Electron Capture Device (ECD) is a suitable detector. An ECD
consists of a cavity through which a so-called make-up gas (nitrogen) ﬂows.
Electrons from a beta source (63Ni, maximum energy 66 keV) partly ionise the
nitrogen gas. The total current produced is collected by an electrode. If an
electronegative substance ﬂows through the cavity at a given time, the missing
collected charge is converted into a peak in the corresponding chromatogram.
The area under the peak is proportional to the amount of electrons captured.

Fig. 13. Chromatograms of syringe-injected samples of three xenon supplies:
SF6-free (Messer) and with SF6 contaminations of 0.3 ppm (Linde2) and 1.1 ppm
(Linde1).

An ECD has been connected to our gas chromatograph [25] in order to analyse
our diﬀerent supplies of xenon. Concentrations as low as 1 ppb are detectable.
The device has been calibrated for SF6 by putting small amounts of this
gas into a glass container ﬁlled with helium. Special care has to be taken
with the injection syringes since they get temporarily contaminated when
exposed to high concentrations of SF6. In addition to the two xenon supplies
(Messer and Linde1) used for the beam measurements reported above (section
5), we have also investigated a more recent supply from Linde (Linde2). The
resulting chromatograms for the two kinds of xenon from Linde and the xenon
from Messer-Griesheim are shown in Fig. 13. The calibration yields 1.1 and
0.35 ppm SF6 for the Linde1 and Linde2 gas samples, respectively, with an
error of about 15%. The xenon from Messer-Griesheim showed 1.5 ppb SF6,
most probably coming from the contaminated syringe. The injection method
also leads to inevitable air contamination, as revealed by the oxygen peak
(corresponding to 400 ppm) in the chromatograms.

supplies of xenon.

Gas chromatography is a simple, accurate and economic technique, but the
chromatograph itself is a rather expensive device. However, for most detector
applications, one does not necessarily need chromatography in order to assess
the gas quality. Measurements with a 55Fe source on standard detectors are
sensitive enough to reveal possible problems due to attachment. In our case, in
order to minimize Xe consumption for such tests, we have built small monitor
detectors for the special purpose of checking the gas quality using 55Fe pulse
height measurements. These monitor detectors have the same electrical ﬁeld
conﬁguration as the drift chambers used for the beam measurements described
above. Their small volume of about half a liter minimizes the loss of xenon gas.
A collimated 55Fe source is placed in front of the entrance window. As the X-
rays are absorbed preferentially at the beginning of the drift region, the cluster
of primary electrons drifts in most cases 3 cm and is subject to attachment
over this distance. For these measurements the anode voltage has been tuned
for a gas gain of about 104. Here we have used a diﬀerent preampliﬁer, with a
gain of 6 mV/fC and noise of about 1000 electrons r.m.s. As a result of a low
ﬂow through the detector, the contamination with O2 and H2O was 70 and
400 ppm, respectively.

Figure 14 shows pulse height spectra for the three supplies of xenon discussed
above. The value of the drift ﬁeld (which corresponds roughly to the antici-
pated operational point of the ﬁnal TRD in ALICE) is 0.71 kV/cm. Compared
to clean Xe (Messer), the 0.35 ppm SF6 contamination in Linde2 Xe leads to
a pulse height distribution with a much smaller value for the main peak. In
addition, a clear tail towards larger pulse height is seen, originating from ab-
sorption of X-rays deeper into the drift region, and thereby subject to less
attachment loss. In case of Linde1 (1.1 ppm SF6) the 55Fe signal is completely
lost. The spectrum recorded is the result of X-rays absorbed in the vicinity of
the anode and of cosmic-ray background. Notice that the number of counts
is much smaller in this case (for a comparable acquisition time). Notice also
that, for the Messer and Linde2 cases, the escape peak of Xe (at 1.76 keV,
compared to 5.96 keV full energy of 55Fe) is clearly visible (in case of Linde2,
the escape peak is partially cut by the threshold).

inﬂuenced by attachment. In Fig. 15 we show the dependence of the amplitude
of the main peak and its FWHM on the drift ﬁeld for Messer and Linde2 sup-
plies. The clean gas shows the expected variation of amplitude as a function

of drift ﬁeld arising from gain increase due to the transparency of the cathode
wire grid. For comparison we include a measurement with an Ar,CH4(10%)
mixture (P10). Compared to this, at low ﬁelds, even for clean Xe, small de-
viations are seen, consistent with attachment on O2; taking the P10 signal as
reference, we deduce an attachment coeﬃcient of 506 bar−2µs−1 for the ﬁeld
value of 0.72 kV/cm, in reasonable agreement to the value determined from
beam tests (section 4). For the Linde2 case this dependence of the signal on
electric ﬁeld is much stronger, as a result of the attachment. This is conﬁrmed
by the energy resolution (lower panel in Fig. 15), which improves dramatically
when going (as a function of drift ﬁeld) from strong to weak attachment.

Fig. 16. Attachment coeﬃcient on SF6 in Xe,CO2(15%) as a function of drift ﬁeld.

We have determined the attachment coeﬃcient on SF6 (under our experimen-
tal conditions mentioned above) using the ratio of the 55Fe amplitudes for the
Messer and Linde2 cases. The drift time is extracted using the drift velocities
calculated with GARFIELD and assuming that the absorption of X-rays takes
place right at the entrance window. The results are presented in Fig. 16 as a
function of drift ﬁeld. As expected, the attachment coeﬃcient on SF6 is large,
of the order of 106 bar−2µs−1. In addition, it has a pronounced dependence
on the drift ﬁeld, in line with our arguments presented in section 6. If we
consider the absorption length of 5.9 keV X-rays in the Xe,CO2(15%) mix-
ture, which is about 3 mm, the attachment coeﬃcient would increase by 10%.
For comparison, we include in this plot the results obtained from the beam
mesurements, taking as a reference the time distribution of signals measured
in the clean case and normalized in the ampliﬁcation region. Taking into ac-
count the uncertainties, in particular coming from the normalization for the
beam measurements, the extracted values for the attachment coeﬃcient are
in reasonable agreement.

8 Summary

We have performed measurements of pulse height distributions in drift cham-
bers operated with Xe,CO2 mixtures. After studying the general behavior of
these distribution under clean conditions, we have investigated the role of oxy-
gen and SF6 contamination of the detection gas. A small signal loss due to
attachment is seen for O2 impurities up to a few hundred ppm. In case of SF6,
a contamination even at the level below 1 ppm produces a dramatic loss of
signal over our drift length of about 3 cm. Attachment on SF6 is studied here
for the ﬁrst time concerning its practical implications for gas detectors. As the
SF6 was found accidentally in some xenon supplies, it is important to have a
careful monitoring of the SF6 contamination when precision measurements are
performed using Xe-based gas mixtures in drift chambers. We have used ECD
gas chromatography analysis to detect and quantify small traces of SF6. We
have shown that measurements of 55Fe signals in monitor detectors are very
sensitive to SF6 contamination, thus allowing an inexpensive in situ check of
the gas quality.

We acknowledge the skills and dedication of A. Radu and J. Hehner in build-
ing our detectors. We are indebted to S. Ilie and C. Jeanpetit for the ﬁrst
analysis of our gas. We appreciate the advice from R. Veenhof concerning the
GARFIELD calculations. We acknowledge P. Szymanski for help during the
measurements at CERN.

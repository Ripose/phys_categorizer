The most important underground detectors addressing Cosmic Ray physics are described, with a special em-

phasis on the description of the used technology.

1. Introduction

The ﬁrst generation of underground experi-
ments ran during the ’80s, triggered by the GUT
theories. The most important results they ob-
tained were the IMB analysis on proton de-
cay, ruling out the minimal SU(5) model, the
8B solar neutrino observation by Kamiokande
and the Supernova SN1987 detection. The im-
pact on the technology development was rele-
vant. Let me quote for instance the NUSEX
this detector proved the relia-
experiment[1]:
bility of digital calorimeters based on plastic
streamer tubes, opening the road to the construc-
tion of the hadronic calorimeters for the LEP
IMB and
experiments(ALEPH[2], OPAL[3]).
Kamiokande showed that the water Cherenkov
technique was robust while LSD pointed out the
possibility of using liquid scintillator to search
for Supernova explosion. The main limitation
of these detectors was the collected statistics .
The natural development was therefore the con-
struction of similar detectors enlarged by an or-
der of magnitude in volume or in area. The ex-
perience gained with NUSEX allowed the con-
struction of MACRO[4], with an acceptance in-
creased to more than two orders of magnitude.
The Kamiokande and the IMB Collaborations
joined Super-Kamiokande, reaching a mass of 50
Ktons and LSD inspired LVD at Gran Sasso, ac-
tually running with 600 tons of liquid scintillator.
The most important questions are: how much
the technology of these experiments is advanced
? Do the most important technological limita-
tions come from the large volume/area used or
this kind of physics requires just a modest detec-
tor performance ? Could they beneﬁt of more

sophisticated techniques ? I will try to answer to
these questions reviewing the main underground
detectors for Cosmic Ray physics actually run-
ning.

2. MACRO

×

Let me start with the MACRO experiment, lo-
cated in the HALL B of Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso. This is a multi purpose experiment
for GUT magnetic monopole search, atmospheric
and Supernova neutrino and Cosmic Ray stud-
ies. The detector consists of 14 horizontal lay-
ers of plastic streamer tubes(PST) and 3 hori-
zontal layers of liquid scintillator(LS). Each side
is closed with a sandwich of 6 PST and a layer
of LS. The cell size of the streamer tube system
3 cm2, larger than the
has a cross section of 3
1 cm2). The readout was per-
NUSEX one (1
formed in NUSEX by using orthogonal pick-up
strips, while in MACRO the wires and a layer
of pick-up strips, forming an angle of 26.5o with
the direction orthogonal to the wires, are read.
The larger cell size, due to the dominant eﬀect of
the multiple scattering of the muons through the
rock, doesn’t aﬀect signiﬁcantly the pointing ac-
curacy. Fig.1 shows the angle between multiple
muons detected by MACRO. Since high energy
multiple muons can be considered parallel within
few milliradians, the distribution is the folding of
the muon multiple scattering with the detector
angular resolution. The 68% of the events has
0.8o.
an angle θ
The distribution is largely dominated by the mul-
tiple scattering, whose contribution at this depth
0.6o. This is a typical exam-
is around σMS
ple in which the granularity of the detector is

1.1o and therefore σθ=1.1o/√2

limited by an external source of indetermination;
an improvement of the detector space resolution
would result just in a small improvement of the
muon position measurement and pointing accu-
racy. Fig. 2[11] shows the MACRO magnetic
monopole ﬂux upper limit. Diﬀerent techniques
are used to identify a monopole in the various
10−3) the liq-
β regions explored. At (10−4
uid scintillator informations are very helpful: the
magnetic monopole signature is a train of pho-
toelectrons, with a duration proportional to the
monopole velocity. This is a delicate search, since
background contamination could mimic the sig-
nal: a simple ADC/TDC system is not enough!
MACRO takes advantage of a Waveform Digitizer
System, with a sampling frequency of 200 MHz.
The system is calibrated using LED light. Fig. 3
[12]shows a muon crossing three layers of liquid
scintillator and the respective Waveforms. The
study of upgoing muons, originating from neu-
trino interaction below the apparatus, requires
high detector performance too. The discrimina-
tion against the much more abundant downgo-
ing muons is obtained by using the time of ﬂight
system (TOF). The rejection factor required for

distribution obtained by MACRO. The left peak
comes from upgoing muons, while the right peak
comes from downgoing muons. The TOF reso-
lution is better than 1ns, allowing a clear sepa-
ration between the two peaks. Of course higher
timing performance with TOF systems have been
reached, for instance a resolution σt
100 ps has
been obtained by the AMS TOF system[13]. Nev-
ertheless, it must be stressed that in this case
a σt
1ns resolution is obtained on a huge scin-
tillator mass (600 tons), making use of 12 me-
ters length counters, running for a long period,
more than 8 years. As far as the physics results
are concerned, such TOF system performance al-
lowed the study of atmospheric neutrino anomaly.
MACRO pointed out [14] a discrepancy between
the real data and the Monte Carlo prediction
for atmospheric νµ ﬂux . The ratio between the
data and the Monte Carlo prediction for upgoing
muon ﬂux was R=0.74

Further informations about neutrino oscillation

tion of underground experiment. This is a typi-
cal situation in which a more advanced technol-
ogy would have been useful. The average energy
of upgoing muon is
20 GeV, while the average
energy of downgoing muons at LNGS rock depth
300 GeV. A ﬁrst attempt to measure the

3. LVD

1

LVD is a multipurpose detector consisting of
a large volume of liquid scintillator interleaved
with limited streamer tubes in a compact geom-
etry [10]. The apparatus has a modulare struc-
ture that consists of aligned towers of 38 modules
each. Every module contains 8 liquid scintilla-
1 m3 seen by
tor counters of dimension 1.5
three photomultipliers. Taking advantage of the
L shaped detectors used as tracking system, LVD
is able to measure the depth-intensity curve up
to 20 Kmwe( Kilometers of water equivalent). As
far as the measurement of muon energy is con-
cerned, LVD measured the quantity <∆E/∆L>
as a function of the rock depth h , where L is the
track length in the scintillator counter and ∆E is
8 Kmwe,
the energy lost in the counters. For h
this observable is expected to increase with h,

since a selection of higher rock depth corresponds
to higher threshold for Cosmic Ray muon energy.
For h>8 Kmwe, the muon ﬂux coming from at-
mospheric muon becomes negligible. Observed
muons come from atmospheric neutrino interac-
tion in the rock in the neighborhood of the de-
tector: νµ+N
µ+X. The diﬀerent origin of the
muons, manifests for instance in the change of
their average energy. This is small signal, dif-
ﬁcult to observe. Fig. 5 shows <∆E/∆L> as a
function of h. Although the statical error for high
depth is large, at h>8 Kmwe a clear decrease of
<∆E/∆L> is visible in the LVD data.

4. Precision measurements

Cosmic ray detectors are usually supposed to
perform measurements only with 10-20% accu-
racy.
I would like to show two examples of
small signals observed deep underground. Let
me start with the measurement of the distri-
bution of the distance between muon pairs de-
tected deep underground, the so called ”deco-
herence”. This distribution depends on diﬀer-
ent cosmic rays features: the C.R. cross section,
the muon parent mesons pt distribution, the mul-
tiple scattering of the muons through the rock.

A special care has been devoted to the study
of the tail at high distance of this distribution,
to search for anomalous high Pt. On the con-
trary the surprise came from the low distance
region. Fig. 6 shows the decoherence function
observed by MACRO. A good agreement is evi-
dent between the MACRO data and the HEMAS
Monte Carlo expectation. Nevertheless, a dis-
crepancy of 34% is found for muon separation
D
80 cm. The same eﬀect has been pointed
out by the LVD Collaboration[18]: again the real
data shows an excess respect to the Monte Carlo.
An explanation of this eﬀect has been proposed
by the LVD Collaboration: muons at short dis-
tance can come from the direct muon pairs pro-
µ+N+µ++µ−. It has
duction by muons: µ+N
been pointed out[21] that such process is sup-
pressed, respect to the electron pair production,
by a factor m2
µ only for small v=Eγ/Eµ. At
high v the cross section is not suppressed by
such factor. Since the produced muon pair lies
at low distance from the original muon, the re-
sults is an excess of events at short distance in
the decoherence function. A data analysis from
MACRO[17] shows that after the inclusion of this
process in the muon transport simulation code,
the agreement between data and Monte Carlo
is restored. Another example of small signal
pointed out in cosmic rays physics is the detection
of photonuclear interaction of muons deep un-

derground. MACRO looked for charged hadrons
300 MeV, produced in the rock surround-
with E
ing the detector[17]. A data analysis based on
11,000 hours of live time, they found 1,938 candi-
date events over a total sample of 9,544,318 muon
events. The result was expressed in terms of the
ratio Rµ+h of the selected µ+hadrons events to
the number of muon events in the same live time.
After the subtraction of the background, they
found for Rµ+h in real data and in the MC sim-
ulations :

5. Super-Kamiokande

The Super-Kamiokande experiment is the un-
derground detector with the largest mass actually
running. Events produced in 50 Ktons of water
are reconstructed by 11,146 PMTs. The main
goals of the experiment are the study of 8B so-
lar neutrino, the search for proton decay and the
study of atmospheric neutrino. As far as the at-

(Φνµ )data/(Φνµ )MC as a function of

sin2(2θ)=1., is impressive. From a technical point
of view, the SuperK analysis is based on single
ring events only, therefore the reconstructed en-
ergy E of the event relies only on the muon energy.
The precision in the measurement of L is also re-
duced, since the event kinematic is not completely
deﬁned. The most important goal of the next gen-
eration of atmospheric neutrino detector is the
improvement of the L/E ratio measurement. Dif-
ferent ideas have been proposed. The measure-
ment of the hadrons produced in neutrino events
with a highly segmented calorimeter with mass
10Ktons or the use of a massive calorimeter
≃
(M> 30 kton) to measure fully contained events
with any track multiplicity.

6. Conclusion

Usually the underground detectors for Cosmic
Ray studies are much more coarse than acceler-
ator experiments. Such a low granularity comes
from the high area/volume required, imposing an
upper limit on the detector cost and on the num-
ber of electronic channels to be taken under con-
trol. Moreover sometimes the coarseness of the
experiment is ﬁxed by the working conditions.
Nevertheless, a good technical performance is re-
quired to these experiments:

mospheric neutrino is concerned, several measure-
ments can be performed by SuperK: the νµ/νe ra-
tio, the measurement of stopping/through-going
muons and the measurement of the νµ ﬂux as a
function of L/E, where L is the distance trav-
elled by neutrino and E is the neutrino en-
ergy. The analysis of the ratio R=(νµ/νe)data/
(νµ/νe)MC has been performed by several experi-
ments. The NUSEX measurement[5] was aﬀected
by a large statistical error: R=(0.96+.32
−.28), while
the FREJUS Collaboration reported a substan-
tial agreement between data and Monte Carlo[15]:
R=(1.00

two Cherenkov detectors. IMB[6] found a ratio

match between calorimetric and Cherenkov re-
sults, was recently restored by the Soudan II
calorimeter. The Soudan II Collaboration re-
ported [9] a ratio R=(0.64
−0.05(sys))
based on an exposure of 3.89 kton-year, the
largest for a calorimetric experiment.
The
analysis of SuperK was based on 33 Kton-
year exposure[23].

sample and R=(0.65

the multi-GeV sample. These results, based on
a very large statistical sample, conﬁrmed the
previous measurements. Nevertheless, the inter-
pretation in terms of neutrino oscillation yields

gave a larger ∆m2, for instance Soudan II found

study neutrino oscillation using atmospheric neu-
trino seems to be the evaluation of νµ ﬂux as
a function of L/E: Φνµ = Φνµ (L/E)[22]. Fig.7

- Long data taking. Underground Observatory
looking for Supernova neutrino (LVD,MACRO,
SuperK) have to run for a long time (>10 years),
avoiding any aging eﬀect.
- Flexibility. An high ﬂexibility is required to
these detectors: the physics to be investigated
spans in energy over more than 3 orders of mag-
nitude. At E
10MeV they look for Supernova
neutrino while low energy hadrons produced in
photonuclear interaction of muon have an energy
of few hundreds of MeV. These detectors mea-
sure atmospheric neutrino with E
1 GeV, while
the average energy of cosmic ray muons detected
at Gran Sasso depth is Eµ
- Precision measurements. In some analysis
an high rejection factor against background is re-
quired and signals as small as few 10−4 are suc-
cessfully measured.
About the future the situation is quite diﬀerent
with respect to the ’80s, when the most impor-
tant lack of underground experiments was the
poor statistics collected. The step forward was
the construction of larger detectors, while now
it is not possible to enlarge the underground de-
tectors area/volume by an order of magnitude.
Such mass increase is feasible only with under-
water Cherenkov detectors. Moreover the under-
ground space is limited and the safety rules be-
came much more restrictive. Special care has to
be devoted in the choice of the used materials.
As far as the Cosmic Ray composition study with
underground experiments is concerned, the inter-
pretation of the results obtained by many experi-
ments is nowadays much more urgent than the re-
quest for further experimental data. The lack of
accelerator measurements at high energy and at
high rapidity region, introduces large uncertain-
ties in the Monte Carlo models for the Cosmic
Ray shower development. The trend for the next
generation of underground detectors seems there-
fore to be the construction of atmospheric neu-
trino detectors with reasonable mass and with an
increased granularity. The ICARUS detector[16]
for instance is foreseen to run within the 1999
at Gran Sasso with 600 tons.
It will take ad-
vantage of the superb space resolution to per-
form an unambiguous analysis of the νµ/νe ratio.
Other detectors have been proposed to improve

7

the L/E measurements for atmospheric neutrino.
Together with the Long Base Line experiments,
they will hopefully give an answer on the nature
of the neutrino, using more advanced technology.

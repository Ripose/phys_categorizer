It is shown that a large volume liquid organi sintillator detetor with an energy

resolution of 10 keV at 200 keV (1σ) will be sensitive to solar pp (cid:21)neutrino, if operated

at the target radiopurity levels for the Borexino detetor, or the solar neutrino pro jet

of KamLAND.

Introdution

Present information on the solar neutrino spetrum is based on the very tail of the total

neutrino (cid:29)ux (about 0.2%). The low energy part of the spetrum, and in partiular pp -

neutrino (cid:29)ux, has not been measured diretly yet. After the observation of reator neutrino

osillations by the KamLAND ollaboration [1℄, the spetrometry of the low energy solar

neutrinos is important for the on(cid:28)rmation of the LMA MSW senario, for the restriting of

the allowed LMA parameters region [2℄, as well as for the searh of the neutrino nonstandard

properties.

The pp neutrinos measurement is a ritial test of stellar evolution theory and of neu-

trino osillation solutions. The pp (cid:21)neutrino (cid:29)ux is predited by the Standard Solar Model

(SSM) with a preision of the order of 1%, in ontrast to the 20% preision preditions of

the high energy neutrino (cid:29)ux from the

8B . A disussion of the physis potential of the pp

solar neutrino (cid:29)ux an be found in [3℄,[4℄ and [5℄. A number of pro jets aiming to build

pp -neutrino spetrometers are in the di(cid:27)erent stages of researh and development.

The main problem in the neutrino detetion is the very small ross setions of the

neutrino interations with matter, this demands a large detetors with a very low intrinsi

bakground. Below we summarize brie(cid:29)y the ahievements in the puri(cid:28)ation of the liquid

organi sintillators, and on the basis of the developed tehniques propose a high resolution

detetor, (cid:28)lled with a liquid organi sintillator, with an energy threshold as low as 170-180

keV, apable of registering solar pp (cid:21)neutrinos. A preliminary desription has been reported

in [17℄.

2 Purities ahieved with liquid sintillator detetors

For the present moment the reord on liquid organi sintillator purity with a large sale

sample has been ahieved with the Borexino [18, 19℄ Counting Test Faility (CTF) and

KamLAND detetor [1℄. The available data are summarized in table 2. While the CTF is

a prototype detetor operating with 4 tones of liquid sintillator [20, 21℄, the KamLAND

detetor is loaded with 1000 tones of the liquid sintillator. Both detetors demonstrate

very good puri(cid:28)ation of the sintillator for U

for the

from

238U and
214Bi and

the abundane of

222Rn. The values ited in table 2
T h and
232T h ontent are obtained by ounting the number of the deay sequenes
212Bi in the assumption of seular equilibrium. A preise measurement of
40K was not possible with CTF beause of the sensitivity level, but is

−

3

expeted to be muh better beause of the high e(cid:30)ieny of water extration for the removal

of K ions [19℄. The investigation performed in the frame of the Borexino programme shows
39Ar an be signi(cid:28)antly dereased by the proper hoie
of the N2 for the stripping. The goals for the purity in both Borexino and KamLAND

85Kr and

that the ontent of the

pro jet for the observation of the solar neutrinos are similar.

The importane of the puri(cid:28)ation of the liquid sintillator from the

39Ar and

85Kr

was understood during the operation of the CTF.

3 The design of the detetor

Even in the ase that the desired purity an be ahieved in the future Borexino and

KamLAND experiments, the diret measurements in the pp (cid:21)neutrino energy region are

impossible with these big detetors. In fat, the presene of the beta-deaying

14C isotope

in the liquid organi sintillator sets a lower threshold on the detetor sensitivity. The

measured ontent of the

level of 2

18

10−

×

g/g with respet to the

14C in the liquid sintillator used in the CTF detetor was at the
12C ontent [23℄, and this is the only measurement
14C β - deay is only

available at suh a low onentration. Though the end point of the

156 keV, the energy resolutions of the CTF, as well as Borexino and KamLAND, are not

good enough at this energy in order to set a threshold lower than 250 keV.

Thus, the e(cid:27)orts should be onentrated on the onstrution of a ompat detetor

with the highest possible energy and spatial resolution. We suggest to use PMTs supplied

with hexagonal light onentrators in order to provide 4π overage, in omparison to 21%

for CTF and 30% for Borexino and KamLAND. Additional energy resolution improvement

(about 15%) in the low energy region an be ahieved by using an energy reonstrution

tehnique disussed in [24℄. Good spatial resolution is needed in order to provide an ative

shielding from the external bakground, mainly gammas with energy 1.45 MeV oming

from the

40K deay in the PMT material. The additional passive shielding with 200 m of

ultrapure water is onsidered in the present design.

The possible geometry of the detetor is presented in the Fig.1 in omparison with

Borexino and CTF skethes. The inner vessel is a transparent spherial nylon bag with a

radius of 240 m, ontaining 60 tons of ultrapure pseudoumene with 1.5 g/g of PPO. The

ative shielding is provided by 100 m of the outer layer of sintillator. The 800 PMTs are

mounted on an open struture at a distane of 440 m from the detetor's enter (distane

is ounted from the PMT photoathode). We onsidered also the use of the 8(cid:17) ETL9351

series photomultiplier [25℄. The omparison of the geometrial parameters of Borexino,

CTF and the proposed detetor is presented in the Table 3.

The hoie of the geometry is motivated by the following reasons:

• the highest possible energy and spatial resolution;

• the detetor should (cid:28)t in the existing CTF external tank, whih is 10 m height and

11 m in diameter;

inner vessel with sintillator is shown with a gray olour. The dashed line inside the inner

vessel de(cid:28)nes the (cid:28)duial volume, the outer layer protets the (cid:28)duial volume from the

external gammas. PMTs are uniformly distributed over the surfae shown with a solid line

on the Borexino drawing and with a dashed line on the two others.

• the light registration system should provide maximum possible geometrial overage

with a minimal number of PMTs required;

• the ative shielding of the (cid:28)duial volume is provided by at least 100 m of sintillator;

• the passive shielding against the gammas originating from the PMT impurities is

provided by 200 m of ultrapure water;

• the (cid:28)duial volume of the detetor should be of the order of 10 tons;

• the inner vessel size should be as small as possible in order to avoid the loss of light

in the sintillator and to provide better detetor uniformity;

• to lower the detetor's threshold (< 35 keV) in order to aquire the

shape without deformations aused by the threshold e(cid:27)ets.

A larger size detetor is an unfavourable solution beause of the huge number of the PMTs

neessary to provide 4π overage. The big inner vessel volume in turn dereases the amount

of the light esaping from the interior part of the detetor. The spatial reonstrution of

the lower energy events is ompliated beause of multiple absorption and reemission of

the light on the way to the PMTs with a harateristi length of 1 m [26℄.

The detetor should be supplied with an external muon veto system. The muon veto

system onsisting of about 50 additional PMTs an be mounted on the top and on the

bottom of the ylindrial external tank. The muon reognition e(cid:30)ieny should be at the

level of 99.99% in order to guarantee missed muons ount < 0.1 per day. The muons (cid:29)ux

at the LNGS underground laboratory is about 7 times less than at the Kamioka site.

4 Detetor energy resolution

A detailed analysis of the large volume liquid sintillator detetor energy resolution an be

f (kB, E) is a funtion taking into aount the suppression of the light yield at low

energies, the so alled ionization quenhing.

The oe(cid:30)ient A linking the event energy and the total olleted harge is alled the

light (or photoeletron) yield. The light yield for eletrons an be onsidered linear with

respet to its energy only for energies above 1 MeV. At low energies the phenomenon of

(cid:16)ionization quenhing(cid:17) violates the linear dependene of the light yield versus energy [28℄.

The deviations from the linear law an be taken into aount by the ionization de(cid:28)it

funtion f (kB, E), where kB is Birks' onstant. For the alulations of the ionization

quenhing e(cid:27)et for PC sintillator we used the KB program from the CPC library [29℄.

For the details of the meaning of the parameters see [24℄ and [27℄. For the signal

alulation we used the following parameters: A = 1800 p.e./MeV, v1 = 0, vf = 1, v(p) =

5 Bakgrounds

The sensitivity of the detetor to the solar pp -neutrino depends on the bakground level

in the 170(cid:21) 250- keV energy window. As in Borexino, CTF ([18℄, [20℄) and the KamLAND

solar neutrino pro jet [30℄, the main soures of bakground are

• internal bakground, inluding

14C beta- deay ounts in the neutrino window;

• bakground from the radon dissolved in the bu(cid:27)er ;

• external gamma bakground;

• osmi ray bakground.

In the following subsetions we give an estimate of the bakground ontribution from

eah soure, showing that the main ontribution into the bakground is due to the internal

radionulide deays. The Monte- Carlo method has been used in our alulations in order

to simulate the detetor response to the bakground events. The ode is split in two parts:

the eletron-gamma shower simulation (EG ode) and the simulation of the registered

harge and position (REG ode). The EG ode generates a random position event with

a random initial diretion (for gammas) and follows the gamma- eletron shower using

the EGS-4 ode[31℄. The eletrons and alphas are not propagated in the program and

are onsidered to be point-like, with the position at the initial oordinates. The mean

registered harge orresponding to the eletron's energy Ee is alulated by

The fator fR(r) was estimated with the Monte Carlo method, simulating the light

olletion from the soure, plaed at di(cid:27)erent distanes from the detetor's enter. The

quenhing fator kB = 0.0167 was independently measured for the sintillator on the base
14C

of pseudoumene (PC) [32℄. The value is in agreement with a high statistis (cid:28)t of the

14C spetrum and the detetor's threshold

In order to separate events from the bakground near the

14C spetrum end point, it is

neessary to aquire the part of the spetrum under the physial threshold of the detetor

(170 keV). We propose to use the following tehnique for the detetor triggering. First, the

lower level trigger is produed as a oinidene of the signals from 20 PMTs in a 50 ns gate.

This will give a negligible random oinidene rate at the level < 10−

10

ev/y if all the PMTs

have a dark rate less than 5 kHz. The high level trigger is produed if the total olleted

harge is greater than the preset threshold Qth . The hoie of this threshold will be de(cid:28)ned

by the resolution of the detetor. Let us estimate the last quantity. The mean number

of hannels (cid:28)red for an event with an energy E at the detetor's enter an be alulated

using (8) with NP M = 800. The solution of (8) for < N >= 20 will yield µ0 ≃

0.025, i.e. a

total olleted harge of 20 p.e. This value is the detetor threshold in the sense that only

50% of the events with an energy orresponding to this harge are registered. Of ourse,

this auses a signi(cid:28)ant spetrum deformation near the threshold. In order to avoid these

deformations one should set the threshold at a level that will ut the events with energies

that are not providing 100% registration, i.e. Qth + 3σQth = 20 + 3.√20 = 33.4 p.e. This

harge orresponds to approximately 35 keV if the ionization quenhing at this energy is

50%. Though this alulation was performed for an event at the detetor's enter, and the

real situation is ompliated by the eletronis threshold, it gives a value very lose to the

one obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation.

14C in the sintillator for the sensitivity of the detetor to the pp(cid:21) neutrinos. The results

of the study are summarized in Table 4. One an see that the detetor sensitivity varies

rather slowly with the derease of the

14C ontent in the sintillator. There are several

reasons for this behaviour. First of all, the pp(cid:21) neutrino rate is quite low and with minimal

bakground ontribution the statistial (cid:29)utuations of the pp- rate are the ma jor soure

The last reason is the lower threshold of the detetor of about 25 keV, whih an't be

dereased without inreasing the random eletronis noise. In order to avoid the in(cid:29)uene

of the threshold e(cid:27)et on the spetrum shape it is neessary to set the software threshold

even higher, to about 40 keV. Another motivation to set a higher software threshold is

the presene of low energy external gammas whih an be reonstruted inside the (cid:28)duial

volume due to the poor spatial resolution at low energies.

We an onlude that lower

14C ontent would be desirable but is not ritial for the

detetor sensitivity to pp (cid:21) neutrinos.

14C pile-up events

A potential danger are the

oinidene window. Suh events an in priniple in(cid:29)uene the

14C pile-up events, i.e. events ourring sequentially within a
14C spetrum tail. The
14C pile-up events with energies above 170 keV is about 5%. The total
14C relative abundane and on the oinidene

amount of pile-up events depends on the

fration of the

window:

Np.u. = τGate ×

f 2
14C ×

T,

(11)

where T is the total time of the data taking, τGate = 60 ns is the oinidene gate width,

and f14C is the frequeny of the

mean rate of the events aused by

14C events. For a
14C abundane of 2
14C β - deay is 2.2 Hz. With these values the number of

18

g/g, the

pile-up events is 2.5 per day, and the number of events with energy greater then 170 keV

is only about 0.13 per day.

The seletion of point-like events provides a further possibility to suppress the amount

12

of these events by a fator of at least

resolution at 170 keV and RF V = 140 cm is the radius of the (cid:28)duial volume. Thus, one

5.3 External gamma bakground

The external bakground ounts are aused mainly by the radioative ontamination of the

PMT glass with

238U ,
232T h and Knat in the PMTs is 112 µg/PMT, 47 µg/PMT and 62 mg/PMT respetively,

40K and elements of the U-Th hain. The assumed ontent of the

whih orresponds to the measured radioative ontamination of the phototubes produed

with high purity glass [39℄. We add 30% to these values to aount for the radioative on-

tamination of the onentrator and PMT divider, sealing and support struture. Another

soure of external gammas is radon dissolved in the water bu(cid:27)er.

The results of a simulation show that a R<150 m spatial ut will eliminate all the

events in the neutrino window (170(cid:21)250- keV). Nevertheless, in order to redue the bak-

ground from the penetrating gamma's we suggest to redue the amount of the onstrution

materials ontributing to the bakground. A signi(cid:28)ant amount of the material in Borex-

ino is ontained in the mu-metal shield of the PMTs, whih provides the sreening of the

PMTs against the terrestrial magneti (cid:28)eld. An alternative solution based on the PMTs

orientation has been studied in [40℄. The e(cid:27)et of the PMTs orientation is omparable to

the one ahieved with the PMT sreening with the high magneti permeability metal. Use

of this tehnique ould eliminate about 1 kg of material for eah PMT in proximity to the

inner vessel.

Another possibility to redue the gamma bakground assumes the use of a di(cid:27)erent

topology of the events produed by the eletrons and gammas. The exellent spatial

resolution of the detetor will permit distinguishing point-like energy deposits for eletrons

from the distributed gamma events (β/γ disrimination). The study of the possibility of

suh disrimination for the Borexino detetor is now in progress.

5.4 Cosmi ray indued bakground

The osmi ray indued bakground an be subdivided into the three ategories:

1. Muons rossing the water bu(cid:27)er of the detetor, produing Cerenkov light;

2. Neutrons produed by muon interations, and sequentially stopped in the water or

the sintillator and emitting a 2.2 MeV annihilation gamma;

3. Seondary radioative nulei produed in the muon interations inside the detetor.

Most of the bakground ounts assoiated with muons an be e(cid:27)etively removed by the

muon identifying system (muon veto). One an use the time and spatial struture of the

13

muon indued events in order to reognize them. The muon identi(cid:28)ation proedure was

able to reognize 95% of the muon indued events in the CTF-I detetor [20℄. We assume

also the use of a set of PMTs situated on the top and bottom of the ylindrial external

tank that will inrease the muon identi(cid:28)ation to a value approahing 100%.

Some of the radioative produts of the muon interations with the sintillator have

signi(cid:28)ant life times, that makes it impossible to use a muon tag. These isotopes are

11Be (β− , 11.5 MeV, 13.8 s),

10C (β+, 1.9 MeV + γ ,0.72 MeV, 19.3 s),

11C (β+

, 0.99 MeV,

20.38 min) and

7Be (γ, 0.478 MeV, 53.3 d). The onsidered neutrino window is too narrow

to pik up a signi(cid:28)ant amount of events from these isotopes. Preise evaluations are now

in progress for the Borexino detetor [41℄, but this bakground will ertainly be negligible

in omparison to the other soures onsidered.

6 Neutrino signals

In the alulations we used SSM (cid:29)uxes given by the standard solar model[42℄, neutrino

energy spetra from [43℄(cid:21)[45℄ and survival probabilities for the LMA solar neutrino senario

from [46℄. Signal shapes were onvolved with the detetors response funtion using (3).

6.1 Sensitivity to the pp (cid:21)neutrinos.

The expeted pp (cid:21)neutrino ount for the LMA solar neutrino osillation senario is listed

in table 4. The sensitivity was estimated with the Monte Carlo (MC) method. First, the

total signal was alulated taking into aount the detetor's resolution. In the next step

the normally distributed random signal was generated at eah bin.

A (cid:28)tting funtion onsists of a funtion with 3 ontributes desribing the internal bak-

ground (without

14C), the spetrum of the

14C deay and the neutrino signal:

f (q) = NBkgBkg(q) + N 14C ·

C(q) + Nνφν(q)

(12)

The shape of the internal bakground Bkg(q) was (cid:28)xed, but its normalization (NBkg )

was free. Another free parameter is the normalization of the

14C spetrum N 14C .

The expeted rates are listed in Table 4. The neutral urrent hannel for the neutrinos

of non- eletron (cid:29)avours are taken into aount in the alulations. Other neutrino soures

also have non- negligible ontributions to the total signal in this energy window. The main

soure besides the pp are

7Be neutrinos with a (cid:29)at spetrum (see Fig.2).

Using model (12) we (cid:28)nd out that the total neutrino (cid:29)ux will be measured with 7.5%

(1σ) relative preision. Possible systematis errors due to the unknown shape of the bak-

ground are not inluded in the estimation. We assume that the MC simulation an re-

produe the form of the bakground and only the total normalization of this shape is

unknown. The assumption is reasonable beause of the quite narrow signal window, where

the bakground is dominated by the slowly varying ontinuous spetrum of the soft part

of the gamma spetra of radioative impurities.

6.2 Sensitivity to

7Be neutrinos

The detetor will ount 1070

7Be SSM LMA neutrinos per year in the 200(cid:21)700- keV

energy window with an internal bakground of 1130 events. For omparison, the Borexino

detetor will ount 9390 events in the 250-750 keV energy window with a bakground

of ∼10500 events. We are not presenting here the evaluation of the sensitivity of the
7Be neutrinos. It is lear that the lower mass (fator 10) with omparison

detetor to the

to the Borexino detetor will limit the sensitivity. A ertain gain in the sensitivity an

be ahieved due to better energy resolution of the detetor (fator 2.1). The sensitivity

relative to Borexino for equal time of data taking and equal spei(cid:28) bakground an be

estimated as

of the

7Be neutrino (about 660 keV).

Improvement of the detetor performanes

The performane of the detetor an be improved by using any of the following ideas:

1. Use of the speially designed photomultipliers, providing better quantum

e(cid:30)ieny. The basi idea is the (cid:16)reyling(cid:17) of the inoming photons. Various optial

arrangements have been used to improve light absorption by letting inoming light

interat with the photoathode material more than one (see i.e.

[47℄). The idea

has been revived in reent works [48℄,[49℄, where the authors reported signi(cid:28)ant

inrease of the quantum e(cid:30)ieny, up to a fator 2. There are also indiations on

the possibility of reating a photoathode with very high quantum e(cid:30)ieny using a

material doped with nanopartiles [50℄.

2. Use of the beta/gamma disrimination tehniques. The use of a di(cid:27)erent

topology of the point-like beta events and the spatially distributed gamma- events

an provide an opportunity to disriminate between beta and gamma indued signals

with high e(cid:30)ieny. The method exploits the superior resolutions of the detetor.

3. Choie of the organi sintillator with lower ontent of

indiations that the ontent of

I detetor, namely of the order of 10−

14C . There are
14C an be muh smaller than measured with the CTF-
14C ontribution

21

g/g [38℄. In this ase the

in the bakground an be signi(cid:28)antly redued, and will lead to an improvement of

the detetor's harateristis.

8 Conlusions

It is shown that a high energy resolution detetor with the radiopurity levels neessary for

the operation of Borexino, as well as solar neutrino pro jet of KamLAND, will be sensitive

to solar pp (cid:21)neutrinos. The pro jet an ompete with other existing proposals (see Table 1).

NEWAGE(NEw generation WIMP search with an Advanced Gaseous
tracking device Experiment) project is a direction-sensitive dark matter
search experiment with a gaseous micro time-projection-chamber(µ-TPC).
We report on the performance of the µ-TPC with a detection volume of 23
× 28 × 30 cm3 operated with a carbon-tetraﬂuoride (CF4) of 0.2 bar.

Keywords: Time projection chamber; Micro-pattern detector; dark matter

1. Introduction

Weakly interacting massive particle(WIMPs) are thought to be one of the
most plausible candidates of the dark matter. Most of the dark matter
search experiments are designed to measure only the energy deposition on
the nucleus by a WIMP-nucleus scatterings. Because the amplitude of an
annual modulation signal is only a few % in the rate, positive signatures of
the WIMPs are very diﬃcult for detection with only the energy informa-
tion. Owing to the motion of the solar system with respect to the galactic
halo, the direction-distribution of the WIMP velocity observed at the earth
is expected to show an asymmetry like a wind of WIMPs. Attempts to
detect a positive signature of WIMPs by measuring the recoil angles have
been carried out1–5 ever since it was indicated to be an alternative and a
reliable method.6 Gaseous detectors are one of the most appropriate de-
vices for detecting this WIMP-wind. DRIFT project has performed under-

ground runs for more than two years with a 1m3 time projection chamber
(TPC) ﬁlled with a low pressure CS2 gas.4 We proposed to use a carbon-
tetraﬂuoride (CF4) as a chamber gas of our time projection chambers with
a micro-pixel chamber readout (µ-TPC) aiming to detect WIMPs via spin-
dependent (SD) interactions.7 In this paper, the performance of the µ-TPC
is described.

2. Measurements

2.1. Micro-TPC
A µ-TPC is a time projection chamber with a micro pixel chamber (µ-PIC8)
readout, developed for the detection of tracks of charged particles with
ﬁne spatial resolutions.9 A µ-PIC is a gaseous two-dimensional position-
sensitive detector manufactured by the printed circuit board (PCB) tech-
nology. With the PCB technology, large-area detectors can, in principle, be
mass-produced, which is an inevitable feature for a dark matter detector.
The pixel-pitch of the µ-PIC is 400 µm and the detection area is 31×31
cm2. We had studied the performance of a small size (10 × 10 × 10 cm3 )
µ-TPC with a 0.2 bar CF4 gas.9 We then developed a large-volume µ-TPC
with a detection volume of 23 × 28 × 30 cm3, and studied its fundamental
properties with an Ar-C2H6 gas mixture at a normal pressure.10 The data
acquisition system is described in Ref.11 We will describe the performance
of the µ-TPC with a 0.2 bar CF4 gas in the following subsections.

2.2. Energy calibration

We calibrated the energy of the µ-TPC with α particles generated by the
10B(n, α)7Li(Q=2.7MeV) reaction. We set a glass plate with a size of 27 ×
70 × 1mm3 coated with a thin 0.6 µm 10B layer in the µ-TPC. The picture
of the boron-coated glass set in the µ-TPC is shown in the left panel of Fig.
1. Fast neutrons from 252Cf were moderated and the thermalized neutrons
were captured by the 10B layer. Alpha particles are emitted from the layer
and the integrated two-dimensional image is shown in the right panel of
Fig. 1. It is seen that the α particles from the 10Blayer are detected and
the corresponding position has a high counting rate.

The measured and simulated spectra are shown in Fig 2. The edge which
corresponds to the full energy deposition of the α particle and the α+Li are
seen in the both spectra. The elastic scatterings of the fast neutrons from
the 252Cf source gives an increase of the lower energy part of the measured
energy spectrum.

Alpha peaks(5.6 MeV, 6.1 MeV, 7.2 MeV) form the decays of the radon
daughters are also used for the energy calibration. The energy resolution
was also measured with these alpha peaks and the energy resolution was
50%(FWHM) in the high energy(3-8 MeV) region.

2.3. Absolute detection eﬃciency of nuclear recoils

The detection and the event-selection eﬃciency was measured by irradiating
the fast neutrons from 252Cf. Here the events which satisﬁed the following
three conditions were selected as a nuclear recoil events.

• The track is in the ﬁducial volume (21.5 × 22 × 31 cm3).
• The track has more than three digital hits.
• The track is shorter than 1cm.

The ﬁrst requirement is the ﬁducial cut to reject the protons from the
drift wall, the second is for the direction determination, and the third one is
for the gamma-ray rejection. The detection and the selection eﬃciency was
about 40% at 100 keV and the eﬃciency in the energy region of 100-400keV
(DM energy region) ǫ was ﬁtted by ǫ = 1.0 · erf ((E − 45.8)/165.2), where
erf (x) = 2
0 exp(−x2)dx is the error function and E is the detected
energy. The measured eﬃciency and the best ﬁt function are shown in the

2.4. Direction-dependent detector response

The direction-dependent detector response is one of the most important
properties for the direction-sensitive dark matter search. We irradiated the
fast neutrons from various position to generate ”a uniform recoils”. We
determined the direction of the selected events by ﬁttings the digital hits
and the direction-map is shown in the right panel of Fig. 3. Because we
don’t detect the head-and-tail of the tracks, this mas is restricted to the
half sky, i. e. -90◦ < azimuth <90◦ and -90◦ < zenith <90◦ The response is
not very ﬂat nor symmetry because of the inhomogeneity of the detector. A
much more ﬂat response is expected for the next detector with an improved
manufacture technologies.

2.5. Gamma-ray rejection

It is one of the outstanding advantage of the gaseous TPC that the track-
length and the energy-deposition correlation provides a strong gamma-ray
rejection.9 We measured the gamma-ray rejection factor by irradiating the
gamma-rays from a 137Cs source. Measured spectra with and without the
gamma-ray source and the background-subtracted spectrum are show in
Fig. 4 We deﬁne the gamma-ray miss-identiﬁcation factor (or the electron-
detection eﬃciency) fe as

fe ≡ Rγ − RBG

,

Rsim

where Rγ and RBG are the the measured counting rate DM energy region
with and without the gamma-ray source and Rsim, is the expected rate
of the electrons which has a initial energy in the DM energy region. The

result was fe < 2.0 × 10−
background neutrons in the surface laboratory.

• The absolute eﬃciency is about 0.4% at 100keV.
• The electron miss-identiﬁcation probability is less than 2 × 10−

the 100-400 keV energy range.

• The direction dependent response is measured. After a pilot run in
the surface laboratory, we will start an underground measurement
in Kamioka Observatory in January, 2007.

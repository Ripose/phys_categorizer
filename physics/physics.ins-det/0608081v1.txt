Abstract. The CDF experiment is successfully collecting data from p¯p collisions at the Tevatron in
Run II. As the data samples are getting larger, systematic uncertainties due to the measurement of the
jet energy scale assessed using the calorimeter simulation have become increasingly important. In
many years of operation, the collaboration has gained experience with GFLASH, a fast parametriza-
tion of electromagnetic and hadronic showers used for the calorimeter simulation. We present the
performance of the calorimeter simulation and report on recent improvements based on a reﬁned in
situ tuning technique. The central calorimeter response is reproduced with a precision of 1-2%.

Keywords: CDF, GFLASH, calorimeter simulation

1. INTRODUCTION

Since the start of Run II in 2001, the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) [1] has col-
1 of data of p¯p collisions at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy. In a variety
lected over 1 fb−
of resulting publications, the simulation of the calorimeter has proved to be a crucial el-
ement for the precision measurement of physical observables, like the mass of the top
quark, since it appears as one of the keys to control the jet energy scale systematics.
The CDF calorimeter simulation is based on GFLASH [2], a FORTRAN package used
for the fast simulation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers. It is embedded in a
GEANT3 framework [3] as part of the whole detector simulation and has various advan-
tages w.r.t. the detailed GEANT shower simulation: In CDF it is up to 100 times faster,
and it can be ﬂexibly tuned. The calorimeter simulation was initially tuned to test beam
data and has been improved due to a steadily reﬁned in situ tuning using samples of
isolated charged particles, which recently became available over a remarkably extended
momentum range up to 40 GeV. Here we report on the GFLASH performance effective
for current CDF physics publications and on ongoing improvements contributing to the
ambitious Run II physics program.

2. CDF CALORIMETRY

CDF is a general-purpose charged and neutral particle detector with a calorimeter and
a tracking system. The calorimeter has a central and a forward section subdivided into
a total of ﬁve compartments (Fig. 1): the central electromagnetic, CEM [4], the central
hadronic, CHA [5], the plug electromagnetic, PEM [6], the plug hadronic, PHA [6],
and the wall hadronic, WHA [5]. The calorimeter is of sampling type, with lead (iron)

length shifters. It is subdivided into 44 projective tower groups, each group made of
24 wedges (partially 48 in the plug part) circularly arranged around the Tevatron beam
and pointing to the nominal event vertex. The central and plug part together cover the
< 3.6. The calorimeter encloses a tracking system consisting
pseudorapidity range
of a vertex detector and a cylindrical drift chamber, both situated within a 1.4 T solenoid
magnet. It provides a precise measurement of single charged particle momenta serving
as an energy reference for the calorimeter simulation tuning.

3. GFLASH IN A NUTSHELL

The CDF simulation uses GEANT to propagate particles from the main interaction point
through the detector volume. A shower in GFLASH is initiated when a particle undergoes
the ﬁrst inelastic interaction in the calorimeter. GFLASH treats the calorimeter as one
effective medium using GEANT geometry and material information. GFLASH is ideal for
calorimeter modules which may have a complicated but repetitive sampling structure.
Given an incident particle energy, Einc, the visible energy in the active medium,

is calculated according to the sampling fractions for electrons ( ˆe) and hadrons (ˆh)
relative to the sampling fraction for minimum ionizing particles ( ˆm), taking their relative
fractions cem and chad of energy deposited in the active medium into account. fem(r)
and fhad(r) are electromagnetic and hadronic spatial energy distributions of the form
f (r) = 1
T (r, z), factorizing into a longitudinal proﬁle L(z), which is a function
of the shower depth z, and a lateral proﬁle T (r, z), which depends on z and on the radial
distance r from the shower center. The showers are treated as azimuthally symmetric.

where x = b z and z measured in units of radiation lengths X0. a and b are correlated
parameters generated using two Gaussians, whose means and widths are free parameters
subject to tuning, and a correlation matrix hardwired in GFLASH. Longitudinal hadronic
shower proﬁles are a superposition of three shower classes:

Lh is a purely hadronic component (zh given in units of absorption lengths l 0). Lf
accounts for the component induced by neutral pions from a ﬁrst inelastic interaction
([zf] = X0), and Ll originates from neutral pions occurring in later stages of the shower
development ([zl] = l 0). Each subproﬁle in Eq. (4) is characterized by an individual cor-
, b ) analogously to Eq. (2). The coefﬁcients ci are the relative probabilities
related pair (a

pion ( fp 0) and the fraction of showers with a neutral pion in later interactions ( f l

The global factor fdep is the fraction of deposited energy w.r.t. the energy of the incident
particle. When a shower is generated, correlations between all parameters are properly
taken into account. In total, the longitudinal shower proﬁle is described by 18 indepen-
dent parameters for the hadronic part (the means and widths of the a ’s, b ’s, and of the
fractions fdep, fp 0 and f l

p 0), and four parameters for the purely electromagnetic part.

The lateral energy proﬁle at a given shower depth z has the functional form

T (r) =

2rR2
0
(r2 + R2

0)2 .

The free quantity R0 is given in units of Molière radius (for electromagnetic) or ab-
sorption lengths (for hadronic showers), respectively. R0 is an approximate log-normal
distribution with a mean and a variance parametrized as a function of the incident parti-
cle energy Einc and shower depth z. The mean is given by

R0(Einc, z)

= [R1 + (R2

h

i

−

R3 ln Einc)z]n ,

where n=1(2) for the hadronic (electromagnetic) case. The spread of hadronic showers
increases linearly with shower depth z and decreases logarithmically with Einc. Both
shower types have their own set of adjustable parameter values (the Ri plus three
independent parameters for the variance), thus giving a total of 12 parameters.

After generating the proﬁles, GFLASH distributes the incident particle energy in dis-
crete interval steps following the longitudinal proﬁle, and then deposits energy spots in

the simulated calorimeter volume according to the lateral proﬁle. The number of energy
spots is smeared to account for sampling ﬂuctuations. The visible energy is obtained by
integrating over the energy spots and applying the relative sampling fractions Eq. (1).

4. GFLASH TUNING METHOD

The tuning of GFLASH mostly relies on test beams of electrons and charged pions
with energies between 8 and 230 GeV [7], and has been reﬁned during Run II using
the calorimeter response of single isolated tracks in the momentum range 0.5-40 GeV/c
measured in situ. The tuning of hadronic showers follows a four-step procedure.

Adjusting the MIP peak. Reproducing the response of minimum ionizing particles
(MIP) is the ﬁrst step since it serves as a reference for all other responses, see Eq. (1).
The position and width of the simulated MIP peak is tuned to 57 GeV test beam pions
in the electromagnetic compartments and involves the adjustment of charge collection
efﬁciencies, which is handled by GEANT at this stage of the simulation.

Setting the hadronic energy scale and shape. Next, the shape of the individual en-
ergy distributions in the electromagnetic and hadronic compartment, the sum of both,
and the hadronic response of MIP-like particles in the hadronic compartment are ad-
justed. The tuning is based on 57 GeV test beam pions and involves the most sensitive
longitudinal parameters, the means and widths of a
l and b l (steering the shower com-
ponent induced by p 0’s from later interactions), of b h (which is related to the purely
hadronic component), see Eq. (4), and of the fractions fdep and fp 0 in Eqn. (3) and (5).

Fixing the energy dependence. After the longitudinal proﬁle has been adjusted at
one energy point, the other test beam samples are employed to parametrize the energy
dependence of the parameters, which is typically logarithmic. At this point, also the
inclusion of in situ tracks is important in order to provide a robust extrapolation into the
important low energy region where test beam data are not available. A functional form
f (Einc) = a + b tanh(c ln Einc + d) is used to describe the dependence of the fractions
in Eqn. (3) and (5) on the incident particle energy Einc. Distinct parametrizations in the
central and plug calorimeter were introduced to account for their different sampling
structure. Initial Run II tunes involved samples of single isolated tracks up to 5 GeV/c in
the central and plug part. Recently, the energy evolution of fdep and the relative sampling
fractions, ˆe/ ˆm and ˆh/ ˆm, have been tuned using the total and MIP-like responses of in
situ tracks up to 40 GeV/c (Sec. 6).

Tuning the lateral proﬁle. The lateral proﬁle is treated almost independently from
longitudinal proﬁle details and is tuned solely with Run II data. The parameters Ri of
Eq. (7), which have been initially adjusted to describe the proﬁles in the energy range
0.5-5.0 GeV/c (using default values provided by the H1 collaboration at higher energies),
are now tuned up to particle momenta of 40 GeV/c (Sec. 6).

5. IMPACT ON CDF JET ENERGY SCALE

We ﬁrst report on the performance of the early Run II tuning embodied by CDF physics
publications to date. Despite the good agreement with test beam data [7], the quality of
the simulation used to be hard to control in the intermediate energy region, which is of
particular importance since it constitutes a relevant fraction of the particle spectrum of a
typical jet in CDF. For the initial tuning of the energy evolution of GFLASH parameters,
minimum bias data providing tracks only up to 5 GeV were involved. Later checks based
on special single track samples at higher momenta revealed a underestimation of the
data. The level of agreement in the central was 2% for <12 GeV, 3% for 12 to 20 GeV,
and 4% for >20 GeV [8]. Through convolution with a jet’s typical particle spectrum,
these numbers directly translate into the systematic uncertainties of the jet energy scale
used by CDF to date (Fig. 2, left). The dominant contribution to the total uncertainties
originate from discrepancies between the simulated and measured calorimeter response
and from the low statistical precision of early Run II control samples.

The inhomogeneity of the calorimeter response is accounted for by an h dependent
tuning. Jet responses in the plug and wall part are re-calibrated w.r.t. the better under-
stood central part using a correction derived from di-jet events, b = pprobe
, which
relates the transverse momentum pT of the non-central “probe” jet to the pT of the cen-
tral “trigger” jet. A comparison of the simulated and measured di-jet balance (Fig. 2,
right) shows that the tuning is reproducing many calorimeter particularities along h

6. IN SITU TUNING PROGRESS

The situation in the central calorimeter has now substantially improved due to the
development of dedicated single track triggers with high momentum thresholds up to
15 GeV/c. The samples collected so far (a total of over 20 M events) allow a precise
monitoring of the simulation performance in the energy range 0.5-40 GeV. In addition,
steadily increased single track samples selected in minimum bias events now allow a
consistent tuning of the plug simulation up to incident particle energies of 20 GeV.

total response (TOT) and the CHA response of MIP-like particles with CEM< 670 MeV
using in situ tracks up to 40 GeV, keeping the test beam tuning at higher energies. In-
deed, the simulated TOT and MIP (top) as well as the CEM and CHA responses (bottom)
agree quite well with the data. The total

1-2% precision within 0.5-40 GeV. The new tuning reﬂects more properly the current
condition of the CDF calorimeter, which includes aging effects of the photomultipliers,
and partially replaces the former conservative test beam uncertainties of 4 %.

For the tuning, an experimental proﬁle is deﬁned using the individual

proﬁle. An accurate adjustment of the hadronic lateral proﬁle is important for
two reasons. First, it controls the energy leakage out of the limited
signal regions.
Thus, any proﬁle mismatch between simulation and data causes a bias when tuning the
absolute response. Second, leakage effects directly contribute to systematic uncertainties
due to the correction of jet energies for the energy ﬂow out of a jet cone [8].

availability of large single isolated track samples allows a straightforward systematic
approach: In Eq. (7), the constant R1 denotes the shower core, while Q

ﬁxes how the proﬁle evolves with shower depth and incident particle energy. Since the
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter compartments probe different stages of the
average shower development, R1 and Q can be constrained using the proﬁles measured
in the individual calorimeter compartments. The top of Fig. 4 shows a comparison of
16-24 GeV proﬁles between data and simulation in terms of a standard c 2 estimator.
CHA and CEM provide different contours of preferred parameter values, which helps to
resolve the ambiguity due to the strong anti-correlation of R1 and Q by using a combi-
nation of both (top right). Generally a good agreement between data and simulation is
obtained (bottom). Thus, R1 has been ﬁxed from 0.5 to 40 (20) GeV in the central (plug)
calorimeter, and R2 and R3 can be extracted from the linear energy dependence of Q.

7. ELECTROMAGNETIC RESPONSE

The tuning of electromagnetic showers in GFLASH presents less difﬁculty and is, al-
though important, not detailed in this report. The simulated electromagnetic scale, which
has been set using electron test beam data, was validated in Run II at low momenta using
electrons from J/y decays and at high momenta using electrons from W /Z decays. The
response with a precision of 1.7%. The un-
simulation reproduces the measured

certainty is dominated by a contribution of 1.6% due to electrons pointing at the cracks
between the towers, whereas electrons well contained in the target tower account for less
than 1% [8]. The crack response is complicated due to the presence of instrumentation
(e.g. wavelength shifter) but can be monitored using electron pairs from Z decays. One
electron leg is required to be well contained within a target tower and serves as an energy
reference, the other leg is used as probe to scan the
proﬁle along the tower up to
the crack. The description of the crack response in GFLASH has thus been improved
using a correction function applied to the lateral proﬁle mapping of energy spots.

8. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

GFLASH has been tuned to reproduce the average hadronic response in the CDF central
calorimeter with a precision of 1-2% within the energy range 0.5-40 GeV/c. The electron
response is reproduced with similar precision. An in situ tuning technique developed and
re-ﬁned in Run II has proved to be crucial to overcome past and current performance
limits. GFLASH might also be a promising simulation tool for LHC experiments. It is
more ﬂexible than GEANT, it is tunable, and it demonstrates excellent CPU performance.

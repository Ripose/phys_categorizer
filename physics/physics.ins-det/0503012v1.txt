Abstract

This article analyzes the design of a low-noise ampliﬁer intended as
the input front-end for the measurement of the low-frequency components
(below 10 Hz) of a 50 Ω source. Low residual ﬂicker is the main desired
performance. This feature can only be appreciated if white noise is suﬃ-
ciently low, and if an appropriate design ensures dc stability. An optimal
solution is proposed, in which the low-noise and dc-stability features are
achieved at a reasonable complexity. Gain is accurate to more than 100
kHz, which makes the ampliﬁer an appealing external front-end for fast
Fourier transform (FFT) analyzers.

Often the experimentalist needs a low-noise preampliﬁer for the analysis of low-
frequency components (below 10 Hz) from a 50 Ω source. The desired ampliﬁer
chieﬂy exhibits low residual ﬂicker and high thermal stability, besides low white
noise. Thermal stability without need for temperature control is a desirable
feature. In fact the problem with temperature control, worse than complexity,
is that in a nonstabilized environment thermal gradients ﬂuctuate, and in turn
low-frequency noise is taken in. A low-noise ampliﬁer may be regarded as an

old subject, nonetheless innovation in analysis methods and in available parts
provides insight and new design. The application we initially had in mind is
the postdetection preampliﬁer for phase noise measurements [RG02]. Yet, there
resulted a versatile general-purpose scheme useful in experimental electronics
and physics.

2 Design Strategy

The choice of the input stage determines the success of a precision ampliﬁer.
This issue involves the choice of appropriate devices and of the topology.

Available low-noise devices are the junction ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (JFET)
and the bipolar transistor (BJT), either as part of an operational ampliﬁer or
as a stand-alone component. The white noise of these devices is well under-
stood [vdZ86, vdZ59, Net81, Erd81]. Conversely, ﬂicker noise is still elusive and
relies upon models, the most accredited of which are due to McWhorter [McW57]
and Hooge [Hoo69], or on smart narrow-domain analyses, like [GJ85a, GJ85b,
MJ99], rather than on a uniﬁed theory. Even worse, aging and thermal drift
chieﬂy depend on proprietary technologies, thus scientiﬁc literature ends up to
be of scarce usefulness. The JFET is appealing because of the inherently low
white noise. The noise temperature can be as low as a fraction of a degree
Kelvin. Unfortunately, the low noise of the JFET derives from low input cur-
rent, hence a high input resistance (some MΩ) is necessary. The JFET noise
voltage is hardly lower than 5 nV/√Hz, some ﬁve to six times higher than
the thermal noise of a 50 Ω resistor (√4kT R = 0.89 nV/√Hz). The JFET is
therefore discarded in favor of the BJT.

A feedback scheme, in which the gain is determined by a resistive network, is
necessary for gain accuracy and ﬂatness over frequency. Besides the well known
diﬀerential stage, a single-transistor conﬁguration is possible (Ref. [MF73], page
123), in which the input is connected to the base and the feedback to the emitter.
This conﬁguration was popular in early audio hi-ﬁ ampliﬁers. The advantage of
the single-transistor scheme is that noise power is half the noise of a diﬀerential
stage. On the other hand, in a dc-coupled circuit thermal eﬀects are diﬃcult
to compensate without reintroducing noise, while thermal compensation of the
diﬀerential stage is guaranteed by the symmetry of the base-emitter junctions.
Hence we opt for the diﬀerential pair.

Table 1 compares a selection of low-noise bipolar ampliﬁers. The ﬁrst
columns are based on the speciﬁcations available on the web sites [ana, lin]. The
right-hand column derives from our measurements, discussed in Secs. 3 and 4.
Noise is described in terms of a pair of random sources, voltage and current,
which are assumed independent. This refers to the Rothe-Dahlke model [RD56].
Nonetheless, a correlation factor arises in measurements, due to the distributed
base resistance rbb′ . Whether and how rbb′ is accounted for in the speciﬁca-
tions is often unclear. The noise spectra are approximated with the power law
S(f ) = Pα hαf α. This model, commonly used in the domain of time and fre-
quency, ﬁts to the observations and provides simple rules of transformation of

The noise power spectrum 2√hvhi is the minimum noise of the device, i.e.,
the noise that we expect when the input is connected to a cold (0 K) resistor
of value Rb = phv/hi, still under the assumption that voltage and current are
uncorrelated. When the input resistance takes the optimum value Rb, voltage
and current contributions to noise are equal. The optimum resistance is Rb,w for
white noise and Rb,f for ﬂicker. Denoting by fc the corner frequency at which
ﬂicker noise is equal to white noise, thus fc,v for voltage and fc,i for current, it
holds that Rb,w/Rb,f = pfc,i/fc,v. Interestingly, with most bipolar operational
ampliﬁers we ﬁnd fc,i/fc,v
9. Whereas we have
no explanation for this result, the lower value of the ﬂicker optimum resistance
is a fortunate outcome. The equivalent temperature is the noise power spectrum
10−23 J/K. A crucial parameter
divided by the Boltzmann constant k = 1.38
of Table 1 is the total noise when each input is connected to a 50 Ω resistor
at room temperature. This calculated value includes noise voltage and current,
and the thermal noise of the two resistors. In a complete ampliﬁer two resistors
are needed, at the input and in the feedback circuit.

Still from Table 1, the transistor pairs show lower noise than the operational
ampliﬁers, although the PNP pair is only partially documented. Experience
indicates that PNP transistors are not as good as NPN ones to most extents, but
exhibit lower noise. In other domains, frequency multipliers and radio-frequency
oscillators make use of PNP transistors for critical application because of the
lower ﬂicker noise. Encouraged by this fact, we tried a diﬀerential ampliﬁer
design based on the MAT03, after independent measurement of some samples.

3 Input Stage

The typical noise spectrum of the MAT03, reported in the data sheet, shows
an anomalous slope at low frequencies (0.1–1 Hz), signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
f −1. This is particularly visible at low collector current (10–100 µA), but also
noticeable at IC = 1 mA. We suspect that the typical spectrum reﬂects the
temperature ﬂuctuation of the environment through the temperature coeﬃcient
of the oﬀset voltage VOS rather than providing information on the ﬂicker noise
inherent in the transistor pair. The measurement of a spectrum from 0.1 Hz
takes some 5 min. At that time scale, in a normal laboratory environment the
dominant ﬂuctuation is a drift. If the drift is linear, v(t) = ct starting at t = 0,
c/ω2. Dropping oﬀ the term δ(ω),
the Fourier transform is V (ω) = jπcδ(ω)
which is a dc term not visible in a log-log scale, the power spectrum density,
i.e., the squared Fourier transform, is

A parabolic drift—seldom encountered in practice—has a spectrum proportional
to f −6, while a smoothly walking drift tends to be of the f −5 type. As a conse-
quence, a thermal drift can be mistaken for a random process of slope f 4 to f 5,
which may hide the inherent f −1 noise of the device. For this reason, the test
circuit (Fig. 1) must be enclosed in an appropriate environment. We used, with
similar results, a Dewar ﬂask coupled to the environment via a heat exchanger,
and a metal box mounted on a heat sink that has a mass of 1 kg and a thermal
resistance of 0.6 K/W. These odd layouts provide passive temperature stabi-
lization through a time constant and by eliminating convection, and evacuate
the small amount of heat (200 mW) dissipated by the circuit.

Due to the low value of rbb′ (15–20 Ω) the current measurement can be
made independent of voltage noise, but not vice versa. Thus, we ﬁrst mea-
sure the noise current setting RB = 8 kΩ, which is limited by the oﬀset
current; then we measure the noise voltage setting RB = 10 Ω. A techni-
cal diﬃculty is that at 1 Hz and below most spectrum analyzers—including
our one—must be coupled in dc, hence high oﬀset stability is needed in or-
der to prevent saturation of the analyzer. The measured spectra are Si(f ) =
10−22f −1 A2/Hz (i.e., 1.2 pA/√Hz white, and 11 pA/√Hz

ﬂicker), and Sv(f ) = 10−18 + 1.8
10−19f −1 V2/Hz (i.e., 1 nV/√Hz white, and
425 pV/√Hz ﬂicker). The current spectrum is the inherent noise current of the
diﬀerential pair. Conversely, with the voltage spectrum (Fig. 2) we must ac-
count for the eﬀect of RB and rbb′ . With our test circuit, the expected white

the equivalent base resistance, while the shot noise of the collector current is
neglected. Assuming rbb′ = 16 Ω (from the data sheet), the estimated noise

10−18 V2/Hz. Then, we observe the eﬀect of the current ﬂickering on the test

10−19 V2/Hz. The latter is close to the measured
circuit is R2h−1,i
10−19 V2/Hz. Hence, the observed voltage ﬂickering derives from
value 1.8
the current noise through the external resistors RB and the internal distributed
resistance rbb′ of the transistors. Voltage and current are therefore highly corre-
lated. As a further consequence, the product 2ph−1,vh−1,i is not the minimum
noise power, and the ratio ph−1,v/h−1,i is not the optimum resistance. The
corresponding places in Table 1 are left blank. Due to the measurement uncer-
tainty, we can only state that a true independent voltage ﬂickering, if any, is
10−20 A2/Hz. The same uncertainty aﬀects the optimum
not greater than 4
×
resistance Rb,f , which is close to zero.

The measured white noise is in agreement with the data sheet. On the other
hand, our measurements of ﬂicker noise are made in such unusual conditions that
the results should not be considered in contradiction with the speciﬁcations, as
the speciﬁcations reﬂect the the low-frequency behavior of the device in a normal
environment.

4 Implementation and Results

Figure 3 shows the scheme of the complete ampliﬁer, inspired to the “super
low-noise ampliﬁer” proposed in Fig. 3a of the MAT03 data sheet. The NPN
version is also discussed in Ref. [Fra97] (p. 344). The original circuit makes use
of three diﬀerential pairs connected in parallel, as it is designed for the lowest
50 Ω), like coil microphones. In our
white noise with low impedance sources (
case, using more than one diﬀerential pair would increase the ﬂicker because of
current noise.

noise, which is lower at high IC , dc stability, which is better at low dissipated
power, ﬂicker, and practical convenience. The gain of the diﬀerential pair is
gmRC = 205, where gm = IC /VT = 41 mA/V is the transistor transcon-
ductance, and RC = 5 kΩ is the collector resistance. The overall gain is
500. Hence the gain of the OP27 is of 2.5, which guarantees
1 + RG/RB
the closed-loop stability (here, oscillation-free operation).
If a lower gain is
needed, the gain of the diﬀerential stage must be lowered by inserting RA. The
trick is that the midpoint of RA is a ground for the dynamic signal, hence the
equivalent collector resistance that sets the gain is RC in parallel to 1
2 RG. The
bias current source is a cascode Wilson scheme, which includes a light emitting
diode (LED) that provides some temperature compensation.

The stability of the collector resistors RC is a crucial point because the
voltage across them is of 5 V.
If each of these resistors has a temperature
coeﬃcient of 10−6/K, in the worst case there results a temperature coeﬃcient
of 10 µV/K at the diﬀerential output, which is equivalent to an input thermal
drift of 50 nV/K. This is 1/6 of the thermal coeﬃcient of the diﬀerential pair.

In addition, absolute accuracy is important in order to match the collector
currents. This is necessary to take the full beneﬁt from the symmetry of the
transistor pair.

Two equal ampliﬁers are assembled on a printed circuit board, and inserted
2.8 cm3, 4 mm thick aluminum box (Fig. 4). The box provides
in a 10
thermal coupling to the environment with a suitable time constant, and pre-
vents ﬂuctuations due to convection. LC ﬁlters, of the type commonly used in
HF/VHF circuits, are inserted in series to the power supply, in addition to the
usual bypass capacitors. For best stability, and also for mechanical compatibility
with our equipment, input and output connector are of the SMA type. Input
cables should not PTFE-insulated because of piezoelectricity (see the review
paper [Fuk00]).

Figure 5 shows the noise spectrum of one prototype input terminated to a
50 Ω resistor. The measured noise is √h0 = 1.5 nV/√Hz (white) and ph−1 =
1.1 nV/√Hz (ﬂicker). The corner frequency at which the white and ﬂicker noise
are equal is fc = 0.5 Hz. Converting the ﬂicker noise into two-sample (Allan)
deviation, we get σv(τ ) = 1.3 nV, independent of the measurement time τ .

Finally, we made a simple experiment aimed to explain in practical terms
the importance of a proper mechanical assembly. We ﬁrst removed the Al cover,
exposing the circuit to the air ﬂow of the room, yet in a quiet environment, far

10−19f −5 V2/Hz
paper (80 g/m2). The low-frequency spectrum (Fig. 6) is 5
10−19f −4 V2/Hz in the second case. This
in the ﬁrst case, and about 1.6
indicates the presence of an irregular drift, smoothed by the paper protection.
Interestingly, Hashiguchi [SHOT04] reports on thermal eﬀects with the same
slope and similar cutoﬀ frequencies, observed on a low-noise JFET ampliﬁer for
high impedance sources.

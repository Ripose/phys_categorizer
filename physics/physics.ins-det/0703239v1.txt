Abstract

The reﬂectivity of ultracold neutron (UCN) guides produced with a dedicated technique called Replika has been studied. The
guides are made of nickel, where the surface quality was copied from a glass layer. This results in a surface roughness smaller
than 10 ˚A. The reﬂectivity was measured to be 99.9 % or higher. Those guides can be used at present or future UCN sources to
transport UCN over long distances to the respective experiments without signiﬁcant losses.

Key words: Ultracold neutrons, Replika, Neutron guides, Reﬂectivity

1. Introduction

Ultracold neutrons (UCN) have velocities below 10 m/s
and wavelengths around 1000 ˚A. They are totally reﬂected
under each angle of incidence from certain materials and
hence storable for hundreds of seconds in volumina made
of those materials. This remarkable feature has put UCN
in a favorite role to investigate fundamental properties of
the neutron like its lifetime [1,2], its electric dipole moment
[3,4], or its quantum states in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld
[5].
UCN are guided in reﬂective tubes from the source to the
experiment. The roughness of the guide surface is crucial
for its transport properties. On rough surfaces, neutrons
are non-specular reﬂected, resulting in a diﬀusive transport.
Therefore the number of reﬂections for a neutron to travel
a given distance decreases compared to a smooth surface
with specular reﬂection and the transmission of the guide
will be reduced signiﬁcantly. To overcome this loss, essential
R&D work on UCN guide properties is carried out at many
laboratories [6,7,8,9,10,11,12].
The UCN guides we report on are made of a metallic surface
with a high Fermi potential - natural nickel - whose high
neutron-optical quality is achieved in a replication process
ﬁrst used for UCN application some 20 years ago [13]. The

The coherent interaction of neutrons with a surface is de-
scribed by the Fermi-Potential Vf = V +iW , where V and
W depend on the nuclear properties of the surface atoms
seen by the neutrons [14]. The real part of the potential V
sets a critical velocity vc =
2V /m, with the neutron mass
p
m. Neutrons with a normal velocity component v⊥ < vc are
totally reﬂected from the surface with a probability given
1/2
by the reﬂectivity coeﬃcient R = 1 − 2 W
The dimensionless ratio η = W/V is called the energy-
independent wall-loss probability per bounce. It describes
the UCN losses on the surface material due to absorption
and inelastic scattering.
Nickel is commonly used as guide material due to its high
Fermi-Potential of V =252 neV, which corresponds to a
critical velocity vc = 7 m/s. For UCN with velocities close
to the critical velocity vc, the reﬂectivity decreases rapidly.
However, suﬃciently below vc the reﬂectivity remains
higher than 99.9 %.
Such a high reﬂectivity would allow nearly loss-free UCN
transportation if only some hundreds of reﬂections over
typical distances of meters to the experiment are needed
as it is the case for specular transport. This is no longer
true, however, if non-specular reﬂections come into play. In

Fig. 1. Experimental set-up (not to scale). UCN from the Steyerl turbine at ILL pass the collimation C1 (two symmetrical openings up
and down) and the transport channel between two parallel plates and leave towards the detector. The adjusted distance as shown in the
draft would correspond to d = 2 mm. For larger distances, the UCN see the same opening angle into the channel and do not collide with the
lower plate. The whole set-up was placed in vacuum at a pressure below 5 × 10−4mbar.

ﬁrst order, the probability for diﬀusive reﬂection of a wave
on a rough surface is given by (∆d/λ)2, where ∆d is the
average surface roughness and λ the normal wavelength
component. Therefore, for low loss transportation of UCN,
the surface roughness has to be smaller than 50 ˚A to avoid
diﬀusive loss rates exceeding those from absorption and
inelastic scattering.

3. Replika guides

At the UCN facility PF2 [13] of the Institut Laue Langevin
(ILL), very cold neutrons (v < 100 m/s) are extracted ver-
tically from the liquid D2 source of the high-ﬂux reac-
tor towards the so-called Steyerl-turbine, where they are
Doppler-shifted to the UCN regime. The cryogenic vertical
guide, the curved feeding guide, the turbine blades and the
following exit guides are made of nickel on an all-metal ba-
sis. A detailed description is given in [13]. The main idea
of this so-called Replika technique is to copy the surface
quality of a glass substrate to the guide surface. These metal
guides oﬀer high mechanical ﬂexibility and stability and
withstand the high radiation level close to the reactor core.
The revisited Replika plates were manufactured at S–DH
in the following way: 2000 ˚A nickel was sputtered onto Bo-
roﬂoat glass, gently solved, and then glued up-side-down
onto an Aluminum plate as mechanical support. The di-
mensions of the plates are 500×70×8 mm3. The roughness
was measured using x-rays to be less than 10 ˚A over the
whole surface.

4. Measurement of the reﬂectivity

To measure the neutron reﬂectivity of such Replika
plates, two of them are installed as a neutron guide of
length l = 500 mm with open sides, as shown in ﬁg. 1.
Two collimators C1 and C2, made of cadmium, deﬁne a
mean angle α = (40 ± 6)◦, under which UCN can enter
the guide. The upper plate is ﬁxed, while the lower one is
vertically movable. The distance d between the plates is
adjustable by means of micrometer-screws (MMS) with a
reproducibility δd < 0.05mm. UCN have to undergo many
specular reﬂections before being counted in the detector.

Those UCN, which leave the horizontal parallel plate sys-
tem to its open sides, are immediately absorbed to avoid
reentering. A monitor in front of the guide monitors the
ﬂux of the incoming UCN. Gaseous detectors with low 3He
admixtures are used. Count rates were around 0.3 cps and
1 cps for the detector and the monitor, respectively.
The average UCN velocity at the TES position of the PF2
facility is ∼ 8 m/s.
The background of the detector was measured by a) putting
an UCN absorber between the plates and by b) closing
the diaphragm C3 towards the detector completely. Both
measurements yield a similar background rate around
8 × 10−3 cps. This implies that the background mainly
arises from thermal reactor neutrons which can penetrate
the detector shielding. The background rate of the monitor
was found to be negligible.

5. Analysis

Fig. 2 shows the counts T of the detector after background
correction and normalization to the monitor data. T de-
creases with smaller distances between the plates as ex-
pected: For smaller distances the number of specular reﬂec-
tions increases, according to n(α) = l/d tan α, while the

The term on the right hand side is calculated numerically
as a function of the reﬂectivity R and is compared to the
measured count ratios. An isotropic UCN distribution be-
tween αmin and αmax is assumed. It was shown, that the
results do not depend strongly on the form of the input dis-
tribution as only the diﬀerence in the number of reﬂections
enters.
By evaluating the diﬀerent combinations of the measured
distances d we obtain a reﬂectivity of at least 99.9(1) %.
The loss probability per bounce therefore is smaller than
10−3.

6. Conclusion

All-metal guides produced by a replication process have
shown their potential during more than 20 years of use at
the UCN/VCN facility PF2 of the ILL. They oﬀer high op-
tical performance for both VCN and UCN, are resistant
against high radiation and due to their thinness they are
of high mechanical ﬂexibility.
The revisited Replika technique yields guides with a sur-
face roughness < 10 ˚A. Their reﬂectivity for UCN under re-
alistic experimental conditions was measured to be at least
99.9(1) % per bounce, close to the theoretical expectations.
With this technique, UCN guides of several meters length
for new UCN sources, but also upgrades of existing guide
systems, can be produced.

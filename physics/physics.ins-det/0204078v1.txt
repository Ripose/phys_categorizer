Abstract

Future experiments will use silicon sensors in the harsh radiation environment of
the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) and high magnetic ﬁelds. The drift direction of
the charge carriers is aﬀected by the Lorentz force due to the high magnetic ﬁeld.
Also the resulting radiation damage changes the properties of the drift.

In this paper measurements of the Lorentz angle of electrons and holes before and
after irradiation are reviewed and compared with a simple algorithm to compute
the Lorentz angle.

1 Introduction

The Lorentz angle ΘL, by which charge carriers are deﬂected in a magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, is deﬁned by:

tan(ΘL) =

= µHB = rHµB,

∆x
d

(1)

where d corresponds to the drift distance along the electric ﬁeld and ∆x to
the shift of the signal position (see Fig. 1). If the ionization is produced at the
surface, the drift distance equals the detector thickness. If the ionization is
produced homogeneously by a traversing particle, the averaged drift distance
is only half the detector thickness. The Hall mobility is denoted by µH, the
drift mobility by µ. The Hall mobility in a magnetic ﬁeld diﬀers from the drift

angle of holes and electrons (6). It is equipped with three ﬁbers delivering laser light

mobility without magnetic ﬁeld by the Hall scattering factor rH. This factor
describes the mean free time between carrier collisions, which depends on the
carrier energy (1). The Hall scattering factor has a value of ≈ 0.7 for holes and
≈ 1.15 for electrons at room temperature (2). The mobility µ increases with
temperature proportional to T −2.5 for holes and T −2.2 for electrons as shown
by measurements (3). For the high purity sensors used for particle detection (
dopings < 1013cm−3) the mobility is independent of the doping concentration
(4; 5). The hole mobility is about 470 cm2/Vs at 300 K, the electron mobility is
about 1417 cm2/Vs at 300 K. Thus the drift mobility of electrons is about three
times larger than the hole mobility. Therefore the Lorentz shift is considerably
larger for electrons than for holes and consequently the p-side read out shows a
smaller Lorentz shift than the n-side read out. Still the Lorentz shifts for holes
generated at the surface reach about 40 µm (70 µm) in a 4 T magnetic ﬁeld for
a 320 µm (500 µm) thick detector, so that the shifts should be accounted for.
From the right hand side of Fig. 1 it is clear that a minimum ionising particle
(MIP) yields a broader signal for electrons (n-side) than for holes (p-side).
Another important question is the dependence of the Lorentz shift on the
irradiation dose. The change of drift mobility and electric ﬁeld in the silicon
detector due to defects introduced by radiation damage results in a change of
the Lorentz shift and thus of the alignment of the detector.

2 Experimental results

A comprehensive study of Lorentz shifts of non-irradiated and irradiated sen-
sors was performed at Karlsruhe (6; 7; 8; 9). The Lorentz angle has been
measured for electrons and holes separately. A temperature range of 77 K-
300 K was covered. The Lorentz angle is measured by injecting charges at the
surface on one side and observing the drift through the sensor by measur-
ing the position of the charge on the opposite side (see Fig. 1). Alternative
methods are described in (10; 11).

Charges are generated by injecting laser light with a wavelength of λ ≈ 650 nm,
which has an absorption length of ≈ 3 µm at 300 K. In this case charge carriers
of one type are collected at the nearest electrode, whereas the carriers of the
other type drift towards the opposite side. This allows the measurement of the
Lorentz angle for electrons and holes separately by injecting laser light either
on the p- or n-side. To simulate a MIP an infrared laser with a wavelength of
1060 nm was used, which has an absorption length of ≈ 300 µm at room tem-
perature. Both lasers from Fermions Lasertech (12) have a maximum power of
1 mW, which could be regulated with the pulse height and width of the input
pulse to the laserdiodes. Typically a laser pulse with a width around 1 ns was
generated.The laser pulse was sent to the sensor via a single-mode ﬁbre with
an inner diameter of a few microns. So the beam spot on the detector could
be varied from a few micron onwards by changing the diﬀerence between ﬁbre
and sensor.

For the measurements the JUMBO magnet from the Forschungszentrum Karls-
ruhe (13) was used in a B ≤ 10 T conﬁguration with a warm bore of 72 mm.
The sensors are double sided “baby” detectors of approximately 2x1 cm from
the HERA-B production by Sintef (14). They have a strip pitch of 50 µm on
the p–side and 80 µm on the n–side; the strips on opposite sides are oriented
at an angle of 90◦ with respect to each other. The capacitively coupled read
out strips are connected through a 1 MΩ resistor to the bias ring. The read
out chip for the strip detectors is the Premux128-Chip with a shaping time of
45 ns (15). The chip’s common mode is suppressed by a double correlated sam-
pling technique, which substracts the signal’s baseline. The threshold could be
adjusted but the signal to noise ratio from the laser pulse, corresponding to a
few times the signal from a minimum ionizing particle (MIP), was suﬃciently
high, so that the thresholds were not critical.

The averaged signal position ¯x is computed from either a ﬁt with the sum of
two Gaussians or from the center of gravity of the pulses pi on neighbouring
strips xi, i.e. ¯x =

pi. Both methods gave comparable results.

linear up to 9 T (6), which means that Eq. 1 can be used. Before irradiation
the sensor depletes fully at a bias voltage of 40 V, while after irradiation with
1.0·1013 21 MeV protons / cm2 the depletion voltage has increased to 100 V.
This implies that the bulk is inverted from n-type to p-type material, as ex-
pected (16). The bulk damage of 21 MeV protons is about 2.1 times the damage
from 1 MeV neutrons (17). Numerical results on the Lorentz angles and shifts
have been summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and are displayed in Figs. 2 and 3
before and after irradiation, respectively.

The Lorentz shift for holes is not strongly depending on irradiation as shown
in Fig. 2, while for electrons there is a clear dependence on the irradiation
dose as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. The calculated values in the Tables und

discussed in the text.

Figures are discussed in the next section. The strong decrease of the Lorentz
shift for electrons after irradiation for bias voltages below 100 V originates
from the fact that the detector is not depleted anymore for these voltages,
thus reducing the eﬀective thickness, as will be discussed in section 4.

3 Algorithm for the Lorentz angle at full depletion

In single sided silicon strip detectors with read-out on the p-side the holes are
the ones collected. It is expected that the maximum bias voltage after 10 years
of LHC will be below the breakdown voltage of at least 500V. So the strip
detectors can run at full depletion. For pixel detectors this is not the case as
will be discussed in Sect. 4.

3.1 Non-irradiated sensors

Algorithms for the Lorentz shift will ﬁrst be discussed for non-irradiated sen-
sors and then conclusions for irradiated detectors will be drawn. The mobility
µ(E) is proportional to the mobility at low electric ﬁeld µlow and its behaviour
at high electric ﬁelds is described with the help of a saturation velocity vsat

To calculate the Lorentz shift one has to divide the sensor into several zones
and then compute the shifts in each zone at an average electric ﬁeld. The total
shift is the sum of the shifts in each zone. The electric ﬁeld depends on the
z-position, the bias voltage, the full depletion voltage Udepl and the thickness
of the sensor:

Given the electric ﬁeld, one can calculate the mobility from Eq. 2 and the
corresponding Lorentz shift from Eq. 1. Table 1 shows that the calculations
match the measurements quite well.

The temperature dependence of the Lorentz shift is shown in Fig. 5. The
Lorentz shift varies about 5 µm for a 300 µm thick sensor at 100 V in a 4 T
magnetic ﬁeld, if the temperature is varied between 250 K and 270 K, for both
electrons and holes.

Fig. 6 shows the calculated Lorentz angle as a function of the bias voltage. The
dependence is quite linear for fully depleted sensors. Instead of calculating the
Lorentz angle from the mobility one can use the approximate linearity between

3.2 Irradiated sensors

There are three main parameters, which change after irradiation: the mobility,
the electric ﬁeld and the depletion voltage. As long as the sensor is fully
depleted and - this becomes relevant for electrons - the bias voltage is low, Eqs.
1, 2 and 4 can be used to calculate the Lorentz shift. The precise knowledge
of the depletion voltage is not needed in this case. For higher bias voltages
the saturation of the drift velocity has to be taken into account, at least for
electrons, which implies the use of several zones inside the sensor and Eq. 3
instead of 4 has to be used, which depends on the depletion voltage. Also the
Hall scattering factor might change after irradiation, but in this paper the
Hall scattering factor is assumed to be independent of radiation damage. So
only the dependence of the mobility and the electric ﬁeld on the radiation
dose have to be discussed.

The dependence of the mobility on the irradiation dose is still controversial.
In Ref.(22) no signiﬁcant changes were observed in the transport properties of
both electrons and holes up to 0.5·1014 1 MeV n/cm2 and a prediction is made
that a ﬂuence of at least about 1015 1 MeV n/cm2 is necessary to aﬀect carrier
drift mobilities signiﬁcantly. In Ref. (23) the mobility for both carrier types
in irradiated sensors agree with those for the non-irradiated sensor within the
errors for ﬂuences up to 2·1014 1 MeV n/cm2. In contrast a change of mobility
after irradiation for holes and electrons was observed in Ref. (24):

• The mobility µlow of holes changes slightly from 470 cm2/Vs to about 460 cm2/Vs
after irradiation to a ﬂuence of 1013 1 MeV n/cm2. Above this ﬂuence the
mobility does not change any more. The change of mobility corresponds to
a change in the Lorentz shift of a few percent.

• The mobility µlow of the electrons changes more signiﬁcantly from 1417 cm2/Vs
to 1000 cm2/Vs. The reduction of the mobility is so strong that one has to
take this into account when computing the Lorentz shift.

This agrees with the measurements of Lorentz shift for electrons done in Karls-
ruhe. As demonstrated in Table 3 the data of the irradiated sensor can be well
explained with the help of a reduced mobility µlow.

In an irradiated sensors the so-called double junction eﬀect arises (see for ex-
ample Ref. (25) and (26)). This eﬀect has been observed and modelled for a
speciﬁc sensor using data from TCT (Transient Current Technique) measure-
ments (27). A trend can be observed that with higher bias voltages the double

junction eﬀect is less pronounced. At bias voltages, which are equal or higher
than the depletion voltage, the double junction eﬀect is negligible. Since strip
sensors to be used for the LHC can be biased well above the depletion voltage,
the double junction eﬀect should be small.

4 Algorithm for the Lorentz angle at high irradiation doses

Pixel detectors are located near the beam pipe and therefore have to stand
higher radiation doses than strip detectors. It is not guaranteed that they
can be always fully depleted. Since the bulk inverts after strong irradiation
from n-type to p-type, the pn-junction will be on the n-side and the depletion
starts from the n-side. If not fully depleted, the charge will not reach the p-
side. Therefore the readout is preferentially on the n-side(21), thus collecting
electrons. This inﬂuences the Lorentz shift, because the drift length of the
electrons is shortened and therefore the Lorentz shift will be reduced, as indi-
cated in Fig. 7. Our algorithm is compared with measurements for the ATLAS
pixel sensor reported in Ref. (11). The ATLAS pixel sensors are 280 µm thick
and have a full depletion voltage before irradiation of about 150 V. The mag-
netic ﬁeld during the measurements was 1.4 T and the temperature 300 K for
the non-irradiated sensors and 263 K for the irradiated sensors. The measured
values are compared to the simulated values in Table 4.

The electric ﬁeld in the pixel sensor changes more than in the strip sensor, if
they are not fully depleted after irradiation. In that case the mobility of the
electrons varies appreciably as can be seen in Fig. 8. Therefore the algorithm
divides the z-axis of the sensor into ﬁve parts. In each part the averaged
mobility and corresponding Lorentz shift was calculated using the standard
and reduced mobilities µlow of Table 3 and the total Lorentz shift is the sum
of the shifts in the ﬁve parts, while the Lorentz angle is an eﬀective Lorentz

The full depletion voltage before irradiation is 150 V. The measured data are taken
from (11). The algorithm used for the simulation divides the sensor into ﬁve parts,
in which the mean electric ﬁeld and the corresponding Lorentz shift are calculated.
The averaged Lorentz angle is deﬁned to be the arc tangent of the total Lorentz shift
divided by the depletion depth. Θsim with the reduced mobility ﬁts the data Θmeas
better.

angle, deﬁned by the shift and the drift distance in the detector. Comparing
the simulations with the measurements one observesthat the data can be ﬁtted
better with lower mobilities after irradiation, as expected from the discussion
in Sect.3.2. So it has been shown that the proposed algorithm also works for
the pixel detectors, if the reduced drift length is taken into account.

5 Summary

The Lorentz angle is determined by electric and magnetic ﬁelds and can be
modelled by Eqs. 1, 2 and 3 or 4. Because of the diﬀerent mobility and Hall
scattering factor for holes and electrons, the Lorentz shift for electrons is at
least four times the one for holes. Irradiation decreases the electron mobility
at low electric ﬁelds µlow signiﬁcantly. The hole mobility is hardly aﬀected by
irradiation.

The simulated data have been compared with measured values from HERA-
B test structures and the ATLAS pixel sensor. It has been shown that the
algorithms developed here simulate the Lorentz shifts reasonably well, if one
takes into account the reduced electron mobility after irradiation.

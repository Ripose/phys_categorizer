A proximity focusing ring imaging Cherenkov detector, with the radiator consisting of two or more aerogel
layers of diﬀerent refractive indices, has been tested in 1-4 GeV/c pion beams at KEK. Essentially, a multiple
refractive index aerogel radiator allows for an increase in Cherenkov photon yield on account of the increase
in overall radiator thickness, while avoiding the simultaneous degradation in single photon angular resolution
associated with the increased uncertainty of the emission point. With the refractive index of consecutive layers
suitably increasing in the downstream direction, one may achieve overlapping of the Cherenkov rings from a single
charged particle. In the opposite case of decreasing refractive index, one may obtain well separated rings. In the
former combination an approximately 40% increase in photon yield is accompanied with just a minor degradation
in single photon angular resolution. The impact of this improvement on the π/K separation at the upgraded Belle
detector is discussed.

1. Introduction

Proximity focusing ring imaging Cherenkov
(RICH) counters with non-gaseous radiators have
the advantage of smaller size and are thus well
suited as particle identiﬁcation devices within
more complex particle spectrometers with tight
space constraints. Such a detector with aero-
gel as radiator is envisaged for the upgrade [1]
of the particle identiﬁcation system of the Belle
spectrometer at the KEKB collider [2,3].
In
the present Belle detector, a threshold-type
Cherenkov detector (ACC) [4] enables a good

π/K separation. However, ACC does not provide
suﬃcient separation for high momentum particles
around 4 GeV/c in the forward end-cap region,
and a proximity focusing RICH with aerogel as
radiator is being studied as a candidate for the
detector upgrade.

Diﬀerent aerogel radiators as well as diﬀerent
photon detectors have been investigated in search
of an optimal counter, which would provide the
required 4-5 σ pion-kaon separation in the 1-4
GeV/c momentum range [5]. Good velocity res-
olution of a charged particle track requires good
resolution of the Cherenkov angle of a single pho-
ton and many detected photons. The number of

1

2

photons may be increased by increasing the ra-
diator thickness, but the price to pay is an in-
creased uncertainty of the emission point, i.e. sin-
gle photon angular resolution. However, by ju-
diciously choosing the refractive indices of con-
secutive aerogel radiator layers, one may achieve
overlapping of the corresponding Cherenkov rings
on the photon detector. This represents a sort
of focusing of the photons within the radiator,
and eliminates or at least considerably reduces
the spread due to emission point uncertainty.
to ob-
Another possibility is the opposite, i.e.
lay-
tain separate rings from separate aerogel
ers in which the emission point uncertainty is
given by the thickness of the corresponding layer.
One may also try combinations of the two main
schemes. Note that such a tuning of refractive
index for individual layers is only possible with
aerogel, which may be produced with any desired
refractive index in the range 1.006-1.06.

While the principle was ﬁrst discussed in [6],
the present work reports on measurements made
with diﬀerent combinations of aerogel radiator
layers. First we present estimates of the rela-
tions between the radiator thicknesses and refrac-
tive indices in order to obtain either overlapping
of the Cherenkov rings or their adequate sepa-
ration. Next the experimental apparatus is de-
scribed and the results of measurements and anal-
ysis are given. Finally, we discuss the possibili-
ties of such a detector to meet the expectations
for the upgrade of the Belle particle identiﬁcation
system.

2. RICH with multiple refractive index ra-

diator

The key issue in the performance of a prox-
imity focusing RICH counter is to improve the
Cherenkov angle resolution per track σtrack =
σθ/pNp.e.. By using a thicker aerogel radiator,
the average number of detected photons Np.e. can
be increased, but the single photon Cherenkov
angle resolution σθ degrades due to the increased
uncertainty in the photon emission point. As can
be seen from Fig. 1, the optimal thickness should
be around 20 mm, which was also veriﬁed in pre-
vious investigations [5].

Thickness [mm]

Figure 1. The variation of the ﬁgure of merit,
σθ/pNp.e., with radiator thickness in the case of
a single radiator, proximity focusing RICH, for
three diﬀerent transmission lengths at 400 nm (Λ
in mm).

One way to solve this problem is to use a “dual
radiator” scheme, where one images Cherenkov
photons from two aerogel radiators with diﬀerent
refractive indices as shown in Fig. 2. In the ﬁrst
combination (Fig. 2.b) two aerogel radiators are
used with slightly diﬀerent indices, where the one
with the lower refractive index is positioned up-
stream. If the indices of the two radiators are well
adjusted, the corresponding two rings overlap. In
the following this combination will be referred to
as “focusing combination”.

The other possibility is a “defocusing combina-
tion”, in which the aerogel with higher index is
positioned upstream (Fig. 2.c). If the diﬀerence
of the indices of the two aerogel tiles is appropri-
ately chosen, the two radiators produce two well
separated rings with good resolution.

A naive extension of the dual radiator combi-
nation is to use more than two aerogel radiators
(“multiple radiator”). For the focusing combi-
nation, the indices of aerogels should gradually

increase from the upstream to the downstream
layer. Again, if the index of each layer is well cho-
sen (Fig. 2.d), the angular resolution of the ring
will not be appreciably deteriorated in spite of
a thicker radiator. The defocusing dual radiator
may be extended to four radiators by introducing
the focusing combination in every two layers as
shown in Fig. 2.e. In this case, the RICH has four
radiators with diﬀerent indices where the ﬁrst two
radiators in the upstream position create a larger
ring, and the other two radiators a smaller ring.

3. Radiator parameters and expected per-

formance

The relation between the refractive indices in
the focusing combination in the dual radiator case

3

is derived as follows. Neglecting the refraction at
aerogel boundaries and denoting the thickness of
a single radiator tile as d, the distance between
the center of the downstream radiator and the
photon detector plane as L, and the Cherenkov
angles in both upstream and downstream radia-
tor as θ1 and θ2 respectively, the condition that
the two rings should overlap can be written as
L tan θ2 = (L + d) tan θ1. From this condition the
following approximate relation can be derived

n2 − n1 =

d
n1L

(cid:2)n2
1

− 1 − (mc)2
p2

(cid:3),

where m and p are the pion mass and momentum.
The optimization of the radiator parameters
thus clearly depends on the kinematical region
the counter should cover.
In the case of the
upgrade of the Belle particle identiﬁcation sys-
tem, the indices are optimized for tracks with
p = 4 GeV/c, the highest particle momenta from
two-body B decays. As can be seen from Fig. 3,
the overlap of the two rings remains suﬃciently
good even at lower momenta, so that the emis-
sion point error (full line) does not signiﬁcantly
increase with respect to the single radiator case
of half the thickness (dashed line).

Similarly, since the relation derived above is
valid only for perpendicularly incident tracks, the
performance has to be checked also as a function
of incidence angle. As shown in Fig. 4, only a
modest increase in the emission point error is ex-
pected up to the maximal angle of incidence in the
present application to the Belle upgrade (around
30◦).

For the dual radiator in the defocusing com-
bination, the requirements are much less de-
manding. The two rings have to be well sepa-
rated, and none of them should coincide with the
ring corresponding to the other particle species.
If one requires for the case of π/K separation
that the kaon ring from the upstream radia-
tor (corresponding to the angle θ1(K)) is sepa-
rated by kσθ from the pion ring from the down-
stream radiator tile (corresponding to the angle
θ2(π)), one arrives at the following expression
(1 + d/L) tan θ1(K)− tan θ2(π) = kσθ/ cos2 θ2(π),
from which one may derive a relation between n1
and n2. For a speciﬁc example with d/L = 0.1,

n1 = 1.05, p = 4 GeV/c and σθ = 14 mrad, values
typical for such a counter, we get n1 − n2 = 0.031
for k = 10.

Note that for both the focusing and defocus-
ing combinations the performance of the counter
can be further optimized by varying the ratio of
the thicknesses of the two radiators and the total
thickness of the radiator.

4. Experimental Apparatus

We have performed two beam tests in March
and June 2004. The tests were carried out at
the KEK-PS π2 and T1 beam lines, where pi-
ons with momenta up to 4 GeV/c are available.
The experimental set-up shown in Fig. 5 is basi-
cally the same as in the previous beam test [5].
The counter is composed of one or more layers
of aerogel radiator and a photon-detection plane,
parallel to the radiator face at a distance of 20 cm.
Multi-anode PMTs (Hamamatsu H8500) were
used as photo-detectors. A total of 16 PMTs
were positioned in a 4 × 4 array and aligned at
a 52.5 mm pitch. The surface of each PMT is
divided into 64 (8 × 8) channels with 6.0 mm ×
6.0 mm pixel size. This type of PMT is not im-
mune to the magnetic ﬁeld and cannot be ap-
plied in the Belle spectrometer, so this device is
considered as an intermediate step in our devel-
opment. For the ﬁnal design, we plan to use
the Hamamatsu HAPD or the BURLE Micro-
Channel Plate PMT [7].

As radiators the same set of aerogel samples
was used as in the tests with single refractive in-

dex radiators [5]. These aerogels have indices be-
tween 1.01 and 1.05; the transmission lengths at
400 nm (Λ) are around 30 − 40 mm. In addition,
newly produced aerogels with refractive indices
up to 1.07 were used, as well as two-layer aerogel
samples [8], where a single tile is comprised of two
layers with diﬀerent indices.

5. Measurements and results

A typical distribution of accumulated hits on
the photon detector is shown in Fig. 6. Cherenkov
photons from the two aerogel radiators are clearly
seen as a single ring with a low background level.
The hits near the center of the ring are due to
Cherenkov radiation generated by the beam par-
ticle in the PMT window.

5.1. Test results with dual radiators

We ﬁrst tested the focusing dual radiator com-
bination with aerogel tiles of n = 1.047, Λ =
34 mm in the upstream position, and n = 1.057,
Λ = 25 mm in the downstream position. Both ra-
diators have a thickness of 20 mm. Figure 7 shows
the resulting distribution of the Cherenkov angle
for single photons. Note that the Cherenkov an-
gle is calculated by assuming that the photon is
emitted in the middle of the combined radiator.

lution and the number of detected photons, are
obtained by ﬁtting to this distribution a Gaus-
sian function for the signal and a second order
polynomial for the background. The resulting
single photon resolution σθ is 14.4 mrad, while
the average number detected photons amounts to
Np.e. = 9.6. The Cherenkov angle resolution per
track is calculated to be 4.8 mrad, corresponding
to a 4.8σ π/K separation at 4 GeV/c.

For comparison, measurements were also per-
formed for single radiator cases when only the up-
stream or the downstream aerogel tile of the dual
radiator is used. For the upstream and down-
stream radiator, the measured yield was 6.9 and
7.5 photons per ring, respectively. The single
photon resolution was 13.8 mrad for the single
radiator in the upstream position.

The single photon resolution σθ = 14.4 mrad
for the dual radiator is similar to that for the
single radiator of half the thickness, while the
number of detected photons is larger for the dual
radiator. In the dual radiator RICH, a fraction
of photons emitted in the upstream radiator is
scattered in the downstream aerogel. Therefore,

the photoelectron yield is expected to be Np.e. ∼
N1 exp(−d2/(cos θ1Λ2)) + N2 = 10.6, where N1
(N2) is the number of the detected photons in the
single radiator RICH with only upstream (down-
stream) radiator, θ1 is the Cherenkov angle in the
upstream radiator, while d2 and Λ2 are the thick-
ness and transmission length of the downstream
radiator. This is consistent with the measured
value of 9.6.

We also measured the momentum dependence
of Np.e. and σθ as shown in Fig. 8. Note that
although the overlap of the rings from two radi-
ators is optimized for a certain momentum, the
variation of σθ is for the dual radiator RICH sim-
ilar to that of the single radiator RICH over the
full kinematic range. The increase in σθ at lower
momenta is consistent with the contribution from
multiple scattering.

single photons from 4 GeV/c pions for a defo-

For the defocusing dual radiator set-up, we
used a combination of radiators with n = 1.057
and n = 1.027. Each radiator had a thickness of
20 mm. The single photon Cherenkov angle dis-
tribution for this combination is shown in Fig. 9.
Two well separated rings are clearly seen. The
sum of the number of photons from the two rings
is larger than that from a single radiator with
a thickness of 20 mm, while the resolutions are
almost the same. Note that unfortunately the
transparency of the downstream radiator was low
(Λ = 19 mm) in this particular measurement; the
use of a typical sample of n ≈ 1.03 with the trans-
mission length around 30 mm would considerably
increase the light yield at the outer ring.

We also tested a two-layer aerogel tile with in-
dices of 1.060 and 1.030 in the defocusing com-
bination. We could observe two well separated
rings on the photon detector. However, the pho-
ton yield was rather low because of a short trans-
mission length of the radiator. This is due to the
production procedure for such kind of tiles, which
has not been optimized yet.

5.2. Tests with multiple radiators

In order to study the multiple radiator RICH
in the focusing combination, we prepared a dual
radiator conﬁguration with indices of 1.046 and
1.051, and a triple radiator conﬁguration with in-
dices of 1.046, 1.051 and 1.056. The thickness of
each radiator was 10 mm, such that the dual ra-
diator is 20 mm thick, and the triple radiator is
30 mm thick. The performance of these set-ups
is compared with the single radiator combination
with n = 1.046 and radiator thickness of 10 mm,
20 mm and 30 mm.

Figure 10 shows σθ, Np.e. and σtrack distribu-
tions against the thickness of the radiators. Np.e.
increases as the radiator becomes thicker, and
there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence of Np.e. between
single and multiple radiator combinations. On
the other hand, σθ of the single radiator RICH in-
creases considerably as the radiator gets thicker,
but σθ for the multiple radiator case increases
only slightly. As a result, σtrack is improved by in-
troducing the multiple radiator combination, and
the triple radiator with 30 mm gives the best
σtrack of 4.5 mrad.

We also tested a defocusing multiple radiator
with four radiator indices of 1.051, 1.056, 1.029
and 1.034 in a combination shown in Fig. 2.e.
We compared it with a defocusing dual radiator
RICH with radiators of n = 1.056 and 1.025. The
total thickness of aerogel radiators was 40 mm in
both cases. The measured values of σθ and Np.e.
are listed in Table 1. As expected, we ﬁnd that
the multiple radiator RICH has a better overall
angular resolution at roughly the same photon
yield.

6. Conclusion

We have studied dual and multiple radiator
combinations of the proximity focusing aerogel
RICH detector. For the focusing combination,
we conﬁrmed that the number of detected pho-
tons could be increased without deteriorating an-
gular resolution compared to the single radia-
tor RICH. In the triple radiator conﬁguration we
have achieved a Cherenkov angle resolution per
track of σtrack = 4.5 mrad, which corresponds to
a 5.1σ K/π separation at 4 GeV/c.

In the defocusing dual radiator RICH, we ob-
served two rings with good angular resolution
that were well separated. We also succeeded to
improve the resolution of each ring with a RICH
with four radiators.

Although the dual and multiple radiator prox-
imity focusing RICH looks promising both in
the focusing and defocusing combination, further
studies are needed before deciding which of the
two combinations should be employed, and how
many radiators should be used in the ﬁnal design
for the upgraded Belle detector. The method of
reconstruction and the eﬀect of background will
be studied in detail, especially for the defocus-
ing combination where two rings are produced.We
also plan to test the multiple radiator RICH with
even more layers, and investigate the production
of multi-layer aerogel tiles with a large transmis-
sion length.

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

The paper analyzes the limits of nanoscale dynamic etalon caused by thermal vibration of crys-
talline structure. It is shown that exactly suﬃciently long one-dimensional defect of crystal lattice
should conﬁne the standard accuracy within angstroms.

Keywords: dynamic etalon, thermal vibrations,crystal lattice defects

One of the novel techniques of measuring objects of
nanometer and subnanometer scales is related to creat-
ing dynamic etalons based on the precise measurements
the tunnel microscope probe movements [1]. A linear
dimension is transmitted from the etalon to a measur-
ing system by means of a controlled movement of the
etalon surface at a required distance and measurement
of the above movement. In this case the real accuracy
attained by the measuring system is limited by unpre-
dictable vibrations of the crystal surface. The present
paper is devoted to analysis of the fundamental limits
of such system caused by thermal vibrations of crystal
lattice.

The thermal deviation of crystal atoms from the equi-
librium states is analyzed within the adiabatic approxi-
mation assuming the electron polarization to follow the
relatively slow motion of atoms without delay. For molec-
ular or covalent crystals like diamond, Ge, Si, GaAs the
electron polarization eﬀect is ignorable, whereas for ionic
crystals (NaCl, CsCl, ZnS, etc.) this assumption is well
justiﬁed for all the wave vectors of phonons except for
Ω√ǫ/c (see, e.g.
a suﬃciently small wave vectors kp
Ref. [2, 3]). Here Ω is a characteristic frequency of opti-
cal phonons, ǫ is a crystal permittivity, and c is the light
1013 s−1
speed. In particular, for ZnS, where Ω

To estimate possible eﬀects caused by the crystal sur-
face states and its defects we analyze 1D-, 2D- and 3D-
models. It should be noted that in the cases of 1D- and
2D-models the corresponding lattice is assumed to be
embedded in the 3D-space, so its atoms actually perform
3D-motion.

Let the lattice unit cell contain σ atoms and the value
rnα specify the displacement of atom α (α = 1, 2, . . . , σ)
Z) from its equilibrium
in unit cell n =

are the
crystalline spacing vectors (for the 2D-lattice n3 = 0 and
for the atom chain n2 = 0 also). Then the corresponding
operator ˆrnα and the conjugate creation–annihilation op-
erators b+

This expression actually corresponds to the model of a
disconnected oscillator ensemble and the lower line of ex-
pression (13) matches the estimate of the amplitude of
classical oscillator aﬀected by the white noise with in-
tensity T . For T
Ωopt the value of the
given estimate is evaluated by expression (11). It is ac-
tually an estimate of the thermal vibration amplitude of
a point defect in the bulk or surface of the crystal. So
their eﬀects on the accuracy of the nanoscale dynamical
standard may be ignored.

For the 2-dimensional (plane) lattice integral (15) has

For the 1-dimensional chain the situation changes dra-

lating one-dimensional defects of crystal lattice is rather
formal. Real atoms forming such defects embedded in
solid bulk cannot deviate from their equilibrium positions
for distances exceeding the lattice spacing. So we could
expect that exactly suﬃciently long low-dimensional de-
fects limit the accuracy of the dynamical nanostandard
on scale about angstroms on the side of thermal solid
vibrations.

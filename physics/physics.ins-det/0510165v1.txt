Abstract

The CMS pixel barrel system will consist of three layers built of about 800 modules. One module contains 66560
readout channels and the full pixel barrel system about 48 million channels. It is mandatory to test each channel
for functionality, noise level, trimming mechanism, and bump bonding quality. Diﬀerent methods to determine
the bump bonding yield with electrical measurements have been developed. Measurements of several operational
parameters are also included in the qualiﬁcation procedure. Among them are pixel noise, gains and pedestals. Test
and qualiﬁcation procedures of the pixel barrel modules are described and some results are presented.

1. Introduction

The CMS detector will be built at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. A hybrid pixel
system will be the detector closest to the inter-
action point and should provide reliable pattern
recognition, eﬃcient and precise momentum and
vertex reconstruction in an extremely high track
density environment. This dictates a ﬁne granular-
ity that correspondingly leads to a large number of
readout channels. The testing of the detector build-
ing blocks—modules—of such a system becomes a
challenge. A complete description of the CMS pixel
detector and its design principles are given else-

where [1]. Here, some details relevant to the qual-
iﬁcation of pixel modules will be mentioned.

The pixel barrel system will be composed of
three cylinders with radii of 4, 7 and 11 cm and a
length of 52 cm. Each cylinder is built of ladders
with 8 modules placed on it. To assemble the pixel
barrel detector about 800 modules will be needed.
The pixel barrel module consists of a single sensor
substrate with 16 front-end readout chips (ROC)
bump-bonded to it and a hybrid circuit (HDI—
high density interconnect) mounted on top of the
sensor. Two thin strips of Si3N4 glued to the read-
out chips serve as a base to attach the module to
the cooling frame.

The whole pixel barrel detector will contain
about 48 million readout channels. It is manda-
tory to test each channel for functionality, noise
level, trimming mechanism, and bump bonding

quality. The qualiﬁcation process also includes the
determination of the operational parameters (like
trim bit settings, measurement of noise, gains and
pedestals), a check of the sensor I-V dependence
and a thermal cycling test. The time scale for the
barrel detector construction is about one year.
This implies a necessity to test four modules a day.
To fulﬁll this time-constraint it is anticipated to
use only tested components and perform a failure
diagnostics in parallel with the qualiﬁcation tests.
Further details about the assembling procedure of
the pixel modules can be found in [2].

In the following qualiﬁcation tests and proce-
dures will be described. Some test results will be
presented to illustrate the quality of ROCs and
modules and to describe qualiﬁcation criteria es-
tablished so far.

2. Test procedures

Module qualiﬁcation implies a thorough check
of its performance. Each ROC should be pro-
grammable via setting corresponding DAC regis-
ters. Every pixel readout circuit has to exhibit a
proper behavior. And ﬁnally, one has to be able to
set each module in the operational regime and cal-
ibrate it. Therefore, the test procedure is divided
into three main steps.

First, all 26 DACs are set to their default values
and then the most crucial ones are tuned individ-
ually for each ROC. Among them are DACs which
control the amplitude of an internal calibrate sig-
nal (the corresponding DAC is called Vcal), the
analog current (Vana), the comparator threshold
(Vthrc) and the delay of the internal calibrate sig-
nal with respect to the trigger signal (CalDel).

In the second step the functionality of the pixel
readout circuits and their electrical connections to
the sensor pixel are checked. The following proce-
dures are foreseen:
– Pixel test: check the proper response of each

pixel and ﬁnd defective ones.

– Trim bit test: control the functionality of the
four trim bits responsible for ﬁne tuning of each
pixel’s threshold.

– Bump-bonding test:

control

the bump-

2

bonding quality and ﬁnd missing or defective
bumps.

– Pixel address test: verify that each pixel read-
out circuit responds with the correct pixel ad-
dress.
Finally, it is necessary to determine the main
characteristics, which allows to set a module to the
operational regime and calibrate it, and to validate
proper functionality of the module under opera-
tional voltages, working temperature and temper-
ature variations. This is done by performing the
following procedures:
– Noise: determine pixel noise by measuring the

S-curve for each pixel.

– Trimming: setting thresholds of each pixel to
obtain a uniform response over a whole module.
– Gains and pedestals: perform a ﬁnal calibra-

tion of each pixel.

– I-V curve: verify the absence of the sensor

breakdown and the high leakage current.

– Thermal cycle: test the module behavior un-
der diﬀerent temperatures and determine all rel-
evant parameters for the working temperature
(-10◦C).
Some tests and procedures described in the fol-
lowing are speciﬁc for the CMS pixel detector read-
out chip. Further details about the ROC design
can be found in [3].

2.1. Pixel test

For each pixel the functionality is checked by
inducing a signal via an internal calibrate capaci-
tance. First, it is controlled that the masked (dis-
abled) pixel does not respond if the calibrate signal
is sent to it. Second, for the enabled pixel it is ver-
iﬁed that if a single calibrate signal is sent one and
only one output signal is registered. As a result of
this test a list of defective pixels is produced. Three
modules have been tested so far and only 6 dead
pixels have been found out of almost 200000 pixels.

2.2. Trim bit test

To ﬁne tune the threshold for each pixel four trim
bits are used. The functionality of each trim bit for
every pixel is controlled during this test. Thresh-

olds are measured for each pixel ﬁve times: 1) for
untrimmed state, 2)-5) for trimmed states, when
each time only one trim bit is enabled. Trimmed
and untrimmed thresholds are then compared per
pixel. If a certain bit does not work, the measured
thresholds for trimmed and untrimmed state are
equal. The addresses of pixels with defective trim
bits and the faulty trim bit number are recorded.
Nary defective trim bit has been found in the three
tested modules.

2.3. Bump-bonding test

A bump bonding procedure has been developed
at PSI (for details see [4]). The ﬁrst bump bonding
test will be done on bare modules. But since bonds
can be damaged during the module assembly it
is mandatory to repeat the bump bonding test to
identify pixels with missing or broken bumps in the
fully equipped modules. To speed up and simplify
the procedure several electrical methods without
radioactive sources have been developed. Two of
them rely on the fact that if the ROC preampliﬁer
is set close to saturation and a high leakage current
is drawn through the bump, the preampliﬁer sat-
urates. If the bump is missing, the preampliﬁer is
not saturated. A high leakage current is generated
with a light source (a lamp, for example) or with
a positive bias. Any of these two methods can be
used with bare modules when the sensor is not yet
covered by the HDI.

For the completely assembled module another
method is applied. This method is called the ‘mod-
iﬁed external calibration’. In the ROC a possibil-
ity to send a calibrate signal through the sensor
is implemented (see [3]). In principle, this func-
tionality allows the identiﬁcation of missing bumps
by measuring pixel thresholds. However, due to
cross-talk in the chip even for pixels with missing
bumps the threshold values are close to values mea-
sured for pixels with bumps (see ﬁg. 1). However,
the cross-talk eﬀect can help to identify missing
bumps. Taking two threshold maps—with external
calibrate signal and via cross-talk—and then com-
paring them, one can ﬁnd that pixels with missing
bumps have the same threshold in both measure-
ments. In such a way missing or defective bumps
are identiﬁed and their position is recorded for the
ﬁnal module qualiﬁcation.

The procedures have been validated by apply-
ing them to several specially prepared ROCs with
a sensor where a few bumps have been removed
manually before bump bonding (see ﬁg. 2). Mea-
surements have shown 100% eﬃciency for miss-
ing bump ﬁnding. In one tested module no broken
bumps have been found. In two other modules 4
and 7 broken bumps have been detected. Most of
them are located at the edges in the ﬁrst or last
columns.

2.4. Pixel address test

An individual pixel address consists of ﬁve ana-
log signals: two signals are devoted to the column
index and three to the row index. Each address is
coded into a six level analog signal. To decode cor-
rectly the pixel address, these levels have to be well
separated. The pixel address decoding test has two
goals: ﬁrst, to measure the six levels and ﬁnd the
separation values, and second, to decode the ad-
dress of each pixel and compare with the true one.
Fig. 3 shows six levels and the ‘Ultra black’ sig-
nal level (which is used to mark the beginning and
the end of the data packet and to separate individ-
ual ROC information). All levels in the ﬁgure are
well separated from each other and for such a ROC
there is no problem to decode pixel addresses cor-
rectly. It is also possible that some individual pix-
els generate a wrong address, then such pixels are
counted as defective. In the three tested modules
no wrong addresses have been observed.

2.5. Noise

The threshold for each pixel in a module should
be determined and noisy pixels should be disabled.
The threshold is supposed to be set at least 5 times
higher than the average pixel noise in a ROC. Pix-
els with noise 4-5 times higher than the average will
ﬂood the readout system with a high rate of hits
and cause signiﬁcant dead time and data losses.
Therefore such pixels should be masked. A method

noise (electrons)

to determine the noise level of a pixel is to take
an S-curve, which is the eﬃciency versus the am-
plitude of the calibrate signal. The width of the
S-curve provides the noise measurement, the ﬁt is
done using the error function. The result of such
a test for a single ROC is presented in ﬁg. 4. The
average noise and the spread of the noise distribu-
tion also inﬂuences the module qualiﬁcation. For
non irradiated detectors the threshold will be set at
2000-2500 electrons, hence the average noise value
should not exceed 500 electrons and the spread
should not be more than a few hundred electrons.

2.6. Trimming

The aim of the trim algorithm is to unify the
response of all pixels in a ROC. In practice this
means the uniﬁcation of the pixel’s thresholds. A
common global threshold for all pixels can be set
per ROC (Vthrc DAC). To account for the pixel to
pixel variations a trim mechanism is implemented
with four trim bits which can be set in each pixel.
This mechanism allows to set 16 trim states. By
setting trim bits the threshold of the pixel is de-
creased. The size of the correction is determined
by the trim voltage, which is set per ROC via a
DAC called Vtrim.

The only relevant input parameter to the algo-
rithm described below is the eﬀective threshold at
which the response is to be uniﬁed. This thresh-
old is ﬁxed by choosing the value of the Vcal DAC,
which controls the height of the internal calibrate
pulse. The Vcal value can be related to the charge
expressed in electrons.

Fig. 5. Pixel threshold distribution for untrimmed (a) and trimmed (b) readout chip.

The ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd a value for the global
threshold which corresponds to the target Vcal
value. This is done by measuring for each pixel the
global threshold value at which it starts to respond
(with 50% probability). Since the eﬀective thresh-
olds can only be lowered afterwards, the maxi-
mum value of this distribution determines the com-
mon global threshold per ROC. The found Vthrc
value is used during the rest of the algorithm and
recorded as a parameter for the trimmed ROC.

The second step of the trim algorithm is to ﬁnd
an appropriate trim voltage. First, the Vcal value
is measured for each pixel at the threshold ﬁxed
on the previous step. The pixel, which needs the
highest Vcal value is used to determine the Vtrim.
For this pixel all trim bits are turned on. Then
the trim voltage is increased, until the Vcal of this
pixel reaches the target value. This Vtrim value is
the second parameter set per ROC.

In the third step of the algorithm trim states are
set for each pixel. It is done by ﬁnding the trim bit
conﬁguration at which pixels start to respond to
the target Vcal value. In ﬁg. 5 Vcal distributions
are shown for an untrimmed and a trimmed ROC.
The target Vcal value in this example is set to 80.
The uniformity is improved by a factor of 5 af-
ter trimming. The achieved uniformity (the r.m.s.
value in ﬁg. 5(b)) is about 70 electrons.

2.7. Gains and pedestals

Another qualiﬁcation item is the determination
of gains and pedestals for each pixel. The gains and
pedestals are used to convert the charge collected
by pixels and measured by ADC counts to elec-
trons. The calibration parameters are needed in
oﬀ-line and on-line (at high level trigger) analysis.
It may be problematic to have a precise on-line cal-
ibration based on individual pixels because of their
large number. An obvious solution would be the
use of approximate calibration constants averaged
over one ROC. This will result in a degradation of
the hit resolution because of not precise charge in-
terpolation. The use of approximate values of gains
and pedestals for all pixels in a ROC implies that
the variations of these parameters among pixels
cannot be too large. The spread in the parameters
is acceptable if the mis-calibration contribution to
the track and vertex reconstruction precision is less
then multiple scattering and misalignment eﬀects.
According to [5] the tolerable variation of gains is
about 20%-40% and the pedestal variation might
be as large as 1000-2000 electrons.

The test is performed by injecting various am-
plitudes of the calibrate signal and measuring the
ADC response. The resulting distribution is ﬁtted
by a linear function and the slope (gain) and oﬀset
(pedestal) are recorded for each pixel. These dis-
tributions provide twofold information. If any of

foreseen during the qualiﬁcation procedure. In ﬁg.
7 a set-up for a thermal cycling is shown. Up to
four modules can be tested concurrently. The ther-
mal test will last about 24 hours and the temper-
ature will be varied from +30◦C to −10◦C about
10 times. Operational parameters (like trim bits,
gains and pedestals) will be obtained and recorded.
Any failure during this procedure will eliminate
the use of the module in the ﬁnal construction.

2.8. I-V curve

The measurement of the sensor leakage current
versus the depletion voltage (I-V curve) will be
done several times during the module production.
Finally this measurement will be performed on a
fully assembled module with the aim to control
the absence of any global individual pixel damage
which might occur during assembly. The voltage
will be varied from 0 to 600 V. The total leakage
current should not exceed 2 µA at the operational
voltage (VOP ) of 150 V. The variation of the leak-
age current should satisfy the following constraint
I(VOP )/I(VOP − 50V ) ≤ 2.

2.9. Thermal cycling

The CMS pixel detector will be operated at a
low temperature of −10◦C. To verify the proper
performance at this temperature a thermal test is

3. Module qualiﬁcation

Based on the results of all tests described above
the modules will be qualiﬁed for use in the CMS
pixel barrel detector. A grading scheme is currently
under development. Only after having tested a rea-
sonable amount of modules one can completely
deﬁne the qualiﬁcation criteria. For the time be-
ing many questions remain open, like the deﬁni-
tion of the defective pixels. This is clear for pixels
not responding or pixels with missing bump. It is
not so obvious in the case of defective trim bits
(one or two), highly resistive bump bonds (which
still work) or broad pedestal distribution. Gener-
ally, modules will be sorted in three or four classes
of quality. Those which pass the quality tests and
have less than 1% of defective pixels will be quali-
ﬁed to be used in the pixel system. If the amount
of defects is between 1% and 2%, modules may be

4. Conclusion

In the coming years about 800 pixel modules will
be assembled at PSI. Each of them should pass
comprehensive tests and be qualiﬁed to be used in
the construction of the CMS pixel barrel detector.
A qualiﬁcation procedure has been established to
ensure a reliable and high-quality device. One of
the most crucial tests is the bump bonding quality.
Several procedures have been developed and vali-
dated. All of them provide consistent results. An-
other important procedure is the trimming of the
ROCs. A sophisticated but fast algorithm has been
developed to guarantee an excellent uniﬁcation of
the pixel thresholds down to 2%. The measurement
of the pixel noise, gain and pedestal allows to set a
module in the correct operational regime. I-V test
and thermal cycling procedure ensure that mod-
ules can be operated under CMS conditions. The
overall qualiﬁcation procedure will be tuned and
veriﬁed during the module pre-production period.

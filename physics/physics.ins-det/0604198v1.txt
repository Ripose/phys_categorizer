Abstract

The optimization of the ballistic guide design for the SNS Fundamental Neutron
Physics Beamline 8.9 ˚A line is described. With a careful tuning of the shape of the
curve for the tapered section and the width of the straight section, this optimization
resulted in more than 75% increase in the neutron ﬂux exiting the 33 m long guide
over a straight m = 3.5 guide with the same length.

Key words: Neutron beam line, ballistic guide, Monte Carlo simulation

1 Introduction

Recent years have seen a remarkable progress in the technology of producing
supermirrors, both in terms of the critical angle and the reﬂectivity, which re-
sulted in substantial increase in neutron ﬂux at various neutron beam facilities.
However, for transporting neutrons over long distances (& 30 m), the ﬁnite
reﬂectivity for angles above θc (the critical angle for natural nickel) causes
a signiﬁcant loss in the neutron ﬂux exiting the guide. (The reﬂectivity of a
good m = 3.5 guide is 80% at m = 3.5).

The so-called “ballistic guide” geometry, ﬁrst proposed by Mezei [1], allows
neutrons to be transported over long distances without signiﬁcant losses. We

have performed a careful optimization of the ballistic guide design for the SNS
FNPB 8.9 ˚A Neutron Beam Line using a custom made Monte Carlo simulation
program. With a careful tuning of the shape of the curve for the tapered section
and the width of the straight section, this optimization resulted in more than
a 75% increase in the neutron ﬂux exiting the 33 m long guide over that of a
straight m = 3.5 guide with the same length. In this paper, we describe the
optimization process and present the obtained results. One important point
that needs to be emphasized is that the optimum choice for various aspects of
the ballistic guide geometry, such as the shape of the tapered section and the
widths of the straight section, strongly depends on the angular and positional
distribution of the neutron ﬂux entering the ballistic guide.

This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, the principle of the ballis-
tic guide and some important design considerations are reviewed. Then in
section 3, after a brief description of the SNS FNPB beamline and its char-
acteristics, the optimization process including the Monte Carlo program is
described in detail, and the results are presented.

2 General Consideration

2.1 Ballistic guide – the principle and some design considerations

The term “ballistic guide” refers to an arrangement in which a diverging horn
is followed by a wide (and usually long) straight section, and then by a con-
verging horn (see Fig. 1). With such an arrangement, the divergence (angular
spread) of the incident neutron distribution is turned to a spatial spread by the
diverging horn, which results in a reduced loss during the propagation through
the straight section because of the smaller angles (i.e. higher reﬂectivity) and
fewer bounces (due to the smaller angles and the larger guide width).

Liouville’s theorem states that the following inequality holds for the phase
space occupied by an ensemble of neutrons traveling through a ballistic guide:

∆θi · ∆xi ≤ ∆θS · ∆xS,

(1)

2

and where ∆θi and ∆xi are the angular and spatial spreads of the initial
distribution of the neutrons entering the diverging horn of the ballistic guide,
and ∆θS and ∆xS are those for the neutrons in the straight section right
after the diverging horn. A similar inequality holds for the neutrons in the
straight section right before the converging horn and the neutrons exiting
the converging horn. Note, however, in general in both the diverging and
converging horns, there is an unavoidable loss of neutron ﬂux due to the fact
that the reﬂectivity is less than unity for angles larger than θc. In fact, as we
will see later, the loss in the diverging horn is a major source of loss in ballistic
guide geometry.

The task of optimizing the design is to perform this “phase space rotation”
(from large ∆θi and small ∆xi to small ∆θS and large ∆xS) in the diverging
horn as eﬃciently as possible, i.e. as closely to the equality limit as possi-
ble, while minimizing the loss (due to the ﬁnite reﬂectivity) in the diverging
horn itself. An ineﬃcient phase space rotation would result in a larger than
necessary guide width for the straight section, which would not only be more
expensive to build but would also cause a larger loss in the converging horn.
Also, the shape of the converging horn has to be optimized to minimize addi-
tional losses during the second phase space rotation.

The converging horn does not exactly reverse the eﬀect of the diverging horn
on the neutron phase space. Rather, a loss of neutrons also occurs in the
converging horn, due to the nonlinear nature of ballistic transport. The loss
in the converging horn is another major contributor to the loss in the ballistic
guide. This point is illustrated in Fig. 2, where the red and blue lines represent
the trajectories of two neutrons that had slightly diﬀerent initial conditions
(the neutrons travel from left to right). Despite the small diﬀerence in the
initial conditions, one (red) makes it to the end whereas the other (blue) does
not (these trajectories were calculated by the simulation program described in
this document). The neutron represented by the blue trajectory gets lost when
it makes the second interaction with the wall of the converging horn, where
the angle was too large for the neutron to be reﬂected (the ﬁrst interaction in
the converging horn has the same angle as that in the diverging horn). It can
also be seen that the neutron with the blue trajectory too would make it to
the end without making the second interaction with the wall in the converging
horn, if the straight section were a little shorter or the neutron started at a
slightly diﬀerent location.

For a typical supermirror, the reﬂectivity is virtually unity for angles less than
θc. Therefore, ∆θS does not have to be inﬁnitesimally small. It should rather
be around θc. Otherwise ∆xS would be unnecessarily large, which would cause
a larger loss in the converging horn. This argument provides a good estimate
for the optimum guide width of the straight section. In general, if the input
neutron distribution has an angular spread that extends to mi × θc, then,

text).

the optimum guide width is expected to be in the neighborhood of mi times
the width of the entrance of the diverging horn (or perhaps slightly narrower,
because the narrower the guide is in the straight section, the smaller the loss
is in the converging horn).

2.2 Curved taper

The simplest realization of a ballistic guide uses a straight taper for the di-
verging and converging horns. However, a more eﬃcient phase space rotation
of Eq. (1) can be achieved by using a curved taper as depicted in Fig. 3. This
ﬁgure 3 illustrates how the use of a curved taper for the diverging horn can
result in a smaller loss in the horn and in a more favorable neutron angular
distribution in the straight section. The blue arrow represents a trajectory of
a neutron with a large angle. It would hit the wall of the horn at a larger
angle at point a’ for the straight taper than it would at point a for the curved
taper. Since the reﬂectivity is larger for smaller angles of incident (when the
angle is larger than θc), the curved taper causes a smaller loss for large angle
neutrons than the straight taper. The red arrow represents a trajectory of a
neutron with a small angle. In this case, the neutron would hit the wall at a
larger angle for the curved taper than it would for the straight taper. How-
ever, in this case, the angle is already small (smaller than θc) so hitting the
wall at a larger angle does not lead to a loss. Instead, the ﬁnal angle resulting
from the bounce is closer to being parallel to the z axis for the curved taper,
which results in a reduced loss in the converging horn. (Note if all the neu-
trons have a trajectory parallel to the z axis, the loss in the converging horn
is substantially reduced.)

We therefore considered using a curved taper for the diverging and converging
horns in this study. As is obvious from the discussion in the previous para-
graph, the shape of the curved taper has to be optimized for the given neutron
distribution. To conveniently parameterize the shape of the curve, we used the
following expression for the shape of curved tapers:

(X2 − X1)

represented by the light green curve. The back straight line represents the straight
taper. The blue and red arrows represent neutrons coming in at large and small
angles, respectively.

where X1 and X2 are the half width of the entrance and exit of the horn
and L is the length of the horn, as shown in Fig. 4. The neutron beam travels
in the positive z direction in this ﬁgure, and x is perpendicular to z. Note
that the ﬁrst two terms if Eq. (2) give the straight line that connects the two
points determined by the entrance and exit widths and the length of the horn.
The third term is a quadratic in z, ﬁxed at the endpoints, which represents
the ﬁrst order deviation from the straight line. The dimensionless parameter
a determines the size of this term: a = 0 corresponds to the straight line, and
a = 1 corresponds to matching the derivative at the end of the horn with the
straight section. It gives a curve that deviates from the straight line by |X2−X1|
at z = L/2 (note that both the factor z and z − L are divided by L so that a
is dimensionless).

There is no point in using a parabola, since the source is not point-like. The
advantage of using this parameterization, instead of using parabola, hyper-
bola, or ellipsoid, is that it is linear in the limit of a = 0 instead of in the
asymptotic limit of some parameter p → ∞. No matter which shape we use
– parabola, hyperbola, or ellipsoid – the actual deviation from the straight
line will be small because the horn is several meters long whereas it is only a
few tens of centimeters wide. Therefore our parameterization should capture
the essence of the curved guide. In other words, we do not expect the results
to be too dependent of the details of the shape, which was conﬁrmed for our
particular neutron distribution by adding terms in higher order in z and seeing
no signiﬁcant gain in performance (see Section 3.5).

3 Optimization of the FNPB 8.9 ˚A beamline

3.1 SNS and FNPB

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), currently under construction at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, is an accelerator-based neutron source, and will
provide the world’s most intense pulsed neutron beams for scientiﬁc research
and industrial development [2]. The Fundamental Neutron Physics Beamline
(FNPB), one of the 24 neutron beamlines in the SNS target hall, is dedicated
to fundamental physics using cold and ultracold neutrons. Figure 5 shows the
schematic of the layout of the FNPB beamline. The FNPB has two neutron
beamlines, the “Cold Neutron Line” and the 8.9˚A Line (or “UCN Line”). The
8.9˚A Line is dedicated to experiments that will uses the superthermal process
in superﬂuid liquid helium to produce ultra-cold neutrons. The 8.9˚A neutrons
will be selected by a double crystal monochromator and will be sent to an
external building located about 30 m downstream.

A calculation [4] shows that a neutron ﬂuence of 0.94 × 109 n/s/˚A can be ob-
tained when a straight m = 3.5 guide with a cross section of 12 cm × 14 cm and
a length of 33 m is used to transport the 8.9˚A neutrons from the monochro-
mator to the external building. The goal of this study is to ﬁnd the optimum
geometry for a ballistic guide which transports the 8.9˚A neutrons from the
monochromator to the external building.

3.2 Characteristics of the incident neutron distribution

As mentioned in Section 2, the optimum choice for various aspect of the bal-
listic guide geometry, such as the shape of the tapered section and the widths
of the straight section, strongly depends on the angular and position distribu-
tion of the neutron ﬂux entering the ballistic guide. It is therefore important
to examine the characteristics of the incident neutron distribution in order to

6

Fig. 5. Schematic of the layout of the Fundamental Neutron Physics Facility at the
SNS.

intelligently optimize the design of the ballistic guide. Figures 6 and 7 show
the position and angular distribution in the horizontal (x) and vertical (y)
directions of the neutrons coming out of the double crystal monochromator.
These distributions were obtained from a Monte Carlo program written by
P. Huﬀman based on McStas [5], which generates neutrons according to the
neutron input source ﬁles for the SNS target and tracks neutrons through the
FNPB beamline elements including the double crystal monochromator that
extracts the 8.9 ˚A neutrons [4].

The position distributions shown in Fig. 6 conﬁrm that the choice of the cross
section of 12 cm × 14 cm for the entrance of the ballistic guide is reasonable.

For the angular distributions, from Fig. 7 we notice that the horizontal angular
spread is only |∆θx| < 2θc whereas the vertical angular spread is as large as
|∆θy| ∼ 4θc. This is because of the mosaic structure of the crystals that
are used in the double crystal monochromator, and also because of how the
two crystals are arranged in the double crystal monochromator. The angular

7

Fig. 6. Horizontal (top) and vertical (bottom) position distributions of the neutrons

spread caused by the randomly oriented small “blocks” in the mosaic of one
crystal cancels that of the other crystal to the ﬁrst order in the horizontal
direction but not in the vertical direction when the two crystals are arranged
horizontally. The narrow horizontal angular distribution also indicates that the
neutron guide upstream of the double crystal monochromator is long enough
for the neutrons with large angles be be lost while they travel from the SNS
target to the monochromator.

The implication of these two angular distributions to the design of the ballistic
guide is as follows (see Fig. 8 for the notation):

• For the horizontal direction, from Eq. (1) and the succeeding argument, the
optimum width of the straight section is expected to be XW 2 ∼ 2×XW 1 =
24 cm.

• Also, since the angular spread is relatively small in the horizontal direction,
it is expected that the supermirror coating can have a smaller value for m
on the side walls of the diverging horn.

8

Fig. 7. Horizontal (top) and vertical (bottom) angular distributions of the neutrons
coming out of the double crystal monochromator. The angles are in the unit of θc.

• On the other hand, in the vertical direction, because of the large angular
spread, the width of the straight section should ideally be Y W 2 ∼ 4 ×
Y W 1 = 56 cm. However, it is mechanically limited to ∼ 30 cm.

As discussed in Section 3.3, we varied XW 2 between 15 cm and 30 cm in
search of the optimum ballistic guide design.

We note that the angular spread could be reduced by using graphite crystals
with a smaller mosaic angle [6].

3.3 Simulation program

The optimization of the ballistic guide was performed using a Monte Carlo
simulation. A new neutron ray tracing package, dubbed neutrack 8.9, was
written to perform a series of transmission calculations to optimize the ballis-

9

tic guide for the 8.9 ˚A line. While there was already an McStas program to
simulate the whole FNPB beamline system, we decided that it was advanta-
geous to develop a new ray tracing package and write a whole new program
using it to design the 8.9 ˚A line for several reasons, including the following:

• The McStas FNPB simulation tracks neutrons all the way from the SNS
target down to the end of the beam line for all wavelengths. The fraction
of the neutrons that get selected by the monochromator and get sent to
the 8.9 ˚A line is very small. However, optimizing the ballistic guide de-
sign only involve simulating neutrons downstream of the monochromator.
The simulation can be done more eﬃciently if the program simulates only
the components downstream of the monochromator, generating only 8.9 ˚A
neutrons at the entrance to the ballistic guide.

• Information important in designing a ballistic guide – such as, where exactly
in the system neutrons are lost and what the distribution is like for the angle
at which the neutrons interact with each segment of supermirror – is not
easily accessible by the user in McStas.

neutrack 8.9 is designed to simulate only a single wavelength of neutrons.
The user has a complete access to information such as where exactly in the
system neutrons are lost and what the distribution is like for the angle at
which the neutrons interact with each segment of supermirror.

A Monte Carlo simulation program using neutrack 8.9 was written to sim-
ulate a ballistic guide for the 8.9 ˚A line. Neutrons were generated so that their
distribution reproduces that of the neutrons coming out of the double crystal
monochromator calculated by the McStas FNPB simulation. The neutrons
were then introduced into the ballistic guide, and the behavior of the neutrons
in the guide was simulated. The performance of various geometries was eval-
uated using the transmission (txmit) – the ratio of the number of neutrons
exiting the guide to the number of neutrons entering the guide – and the rel-
ative transmission (rel. txmit) – the ratio of the transmission of the guide
geometry under consideration to that of the 12 cm × 14 cm straight guide.
(Note that since the input to the ballistic guide is the same for all diﬀerent
geometries, the relative transmission is the same as the output neutron ﬂux
or ﬂuence normalized to that of the straight guide.)

Various parameters including properties of the supermirrors were adjusted so
that the results of this 8.9 ˚A line simulation program agreed with those from
the McStas FNPB simulation program for the same ballistic guide geometry.
It was conﬁrmed for several selected geometries that the results for the relative
transmission from both simulation programs for the same geometry agreed
within the statistical error of the simulation (∼ 1%) as shown in Table 1.
It was important to reproduce the input neutron distributions obtained from
the McStas FNPB simulation in the 8.9 ˚A line simulation, including the

correlation between the vertical position and the vertical angle to obtain an
agreement between the two simulation programs. Because of the simplicity of
neutrack 8.9 and because the 8.9 ˚A line simulation program only simulates
the 8.9 ˚A line downstream of the monochromator, it is a more than two orders
of magnitude faster than the McStas FNPB simulation program to obtain
results with the same statistical precision.

3.4 Physics-motivated optimization

Monte Carlo simulations were performed for various ballistic guide geometries
to ﬁnd the optimum geometry [high performance (= high transmission) and
low cost]. We ﬁrst performed an optimization in which the ranges of various
parameters were selected based on the considerations given in Section 2.

The parameters used to describe the ballistic guide geometry are listed in
Table 2 along with the value for the ﬁxed parameters or the range of variation
for optimized parameters. Some of the parameters are illustrated in Fig. 8. The
values and the ranges for the parameters reﬂect various boundary conditions
(e.g. the largest guide width practically possible is ∼ 30 cm) and considerations
(such as those discussed in Sections 2.1 and 3.2). For this study the length of
the converging horn L3 was set to be the same as the length of the diverging
horn L1 since no signiﬁcant gain was seen when L3 was varied independent
of L1 in a preliminary study.

When performing Monte Carlo simulation for geometries with curved taper,
the curved taper was approximated by a series of short segments with straight
tapers at diﬀerent angles. Usually, each horn was divided into ﬁve segments to
keep the computation time short (the computation time scales approximately
as the number of the mirror segments). For a few selected geometries, a ﬁner
division was also tried. Results from ﬁve segments agreed with results from
fourteen segments (for L1 = 7 m this corresponds to 50 cm long segments)
within 1%.

The dependence of the relative transmission on L1 (=L3) and XW 2 is shown
in Fig. 9 for geometries with straight taper and in Fig. 10 for geometries with
curved taper. For curved taper, the curvature parameters aH and aV were
optimized for each combination of L1 and XW 2. We found that the optimum
values of aH and aV do not have a strong dependence on XW 2, but do depend

on the value of L1. The optimum values of aH and aV for diﬀerent values of
L1 are listed in Table 3.

For all the results plotted in these two Figures, the following values of m
were used for the supermirror coating: m1T B = 3.5, m1LR = 2.0, m2T B =
2.0, m2LR = 1.5, m3T B = 3.5, m3LR = 3.5. We now discuss how each of
these parameters was optimized. Because of the large vertical angular spread
of the initial neutron distribution, it is important to use as high an m as
possible for the top and bottom walls of the diverging horn (m1T B = 3.5).
However, because of the rather narrow horizontal divergence of the initial
neutron distribution, it is not necessary to use as high an m for the side walls.
In fact, reducing m1LR down to 2.0 from 3.5 did not lead to any reduction
of the output neutron ﬂux. This can also be seen from Fig. 11, which shows
a distribution of the incident angle of the neutrons on the side wall of the
diverging horn. It is seen that there are hardly any neutrons incident on the
side wall of the diverging horn with an angle larger than 2 × θc. For the
straight section, the values for the m were determined to be m2T B = 2.0 and
m2LR = 1.5 by looking at the the horizontal and vertical angular distributions

of the neutrons right after the diverging horn, which are shown in Fig. 12.
We further conﬁrmed the validity of these choices by varying the values of
these two m’s and seeing negligible increase in the output neutron ﬂux when
the values of the m’s were increased and seeing a signiﬁcant reduction in
the output neutron ﬂux when the values of the m’s were decreased. For the
converging horn, based on the discussion given in Section 2.1, it is important to
use the largest possible value of m. Therefore, we decided to use m3T B = 3.5,
m3LR = 3.5. It was conﬁrmed by actual Monte Carlo calculations that lowering
these m’s signiﬁcantly decreases the output neutron ﬂux. Reducing the m for
the side walls of the diverging horn and the straight section from m1LR = 3.5
and m2LR = 2.0 to m1LR = 2.0 and m2LR = 1.5 reduced the guide price by
∼ 150, 000 USD or more, which is a substantial cost saving.

Figure 9 shows that geometries with straight taper favor a large L1, with
L1 = 8 m and L1 = 9 m being the optimum. On the other hand, Figure 10
shows that geometries with curved taper favor a shorter L1, with L1 = 7 m
giving the maximum relative transmission (with XW 2 = 20 cm).

To see the eﬀect of curved taper, let us compare Fig. 12 and Fig. 13. These
Figures contain the horizontal and vertical angular distributions of neutrons
exiting the diverging horn for a guide geometry with curved taper (Fig. 12)
and straight taper (Fig. 13). Geometries with L1 = 7 m and XW 2 = 20 cm
are used here as examples. Although for the horizontal angular distribution
the curved taper does not make a big diﬀerence because of the rather narrow
initial distribution, it makes an obvious diﬀerence for the vertical distribution.
Both of the two eﬀects that were discussed in Section 2.2 can be seen, i.e., a
smaller loss in the diverging horn, and a more favorable angular distribution

after the diverging horn. The transmission through the diverging horn is 82%
for curved taper, compared to 77% for the straight taper and the diﬀerence in
the vertical angular distribution is obvious.

Coming back to Figs. 9 and 10, from these ﬁgures we observe the following
three points:

• By using a ballistic guide we obtain a substantial gain in neutron ﬂux (∼
55% for straight taper and ∼ 75% for curved taper as compared to the
straight guide).

• Ballistic guides with curved taper give higher a output neutron ﬂux than

ballistic guides with straight taper.

• The optimum horizontal width for the straight section is around 20 cm
(slightly narrower than expected based on a naive argument given in Sec-
tion 2.1).

in the ballistic guide right after the diverging horn straight taper. The angles are in
units of θc. (For this plot, a geometry with L1 = 7 m, XW 2 = 20 cm, m1T B = 3.5,
m1LR = 2.0 was used as an example.)

In Table 4, the fraction of neutrons lost in various places in the ballistic guide
are listed for the optimum geometry with curved taper and for the optimum
geometry with straight taper. As expected, the use of the curved taper reduces
the loss in the diverging and converging horns.

3.5 Full optimization

In order to verify the results of the physics motivated optimization, we pro-
ceeded to do a full-scale optimization of the ballistic guide geometry, ﬁtting
for as many degrees of freedom as possible. Two goals of this optimization
were a) to investigate the eﬀect of the shape of the diverging and converging
horns, and b) to verify that the two horns should indeed be symmetric.

To investigate the shape of the horn, a cubic term was added to Eq. 2:

ˆx = ˆz [1 + a(1 − ˆz) (1 + b(1 − ˆz))] ,

(3)

in normalized coordinates 0 < ˆx < 1 and 0 < ˆz < 1, where x = X1+|X2−X1| ˆx
and z = L1 + |L2 − L1| ˆz. The coordinates (X1, L1) are at the entrance/exit of
the horn, while (X2, L2) connect to the straight section. The cubic term with
coeﬃcient b was added in such a way that it reduces to Eq. 2 in the limit b = 0,
to a straight line in the limit a = 0, and has the same slope m = 1 − a at the
end of the horn (z = L2). By imposing the constraint of no inﬂection points
over the length of the horn, the cubic term is limited to the range − 1
2 < b < 1.
This extra term allows one to match up the slope of the horn with the straight
section (a = 1) while simultaneously adjusting the slope at z = 0 within the
range 3

2 < dˆx/dˆz < 3.

Noting the large diﬀerence between aH and aV in Table 3, a second parameter
c = LV /LH − 1 was added, relaxing the curved horn to have diﬀerent lengths
in the horizontal and vertical sides. The purpose of this additional parameter
was to ensure that the shape of the horn in the vertical direction was not
constrained by its horizontal length. Separate parameters aH, aV , bH, bV , and
c were optimized for both the diverging and converging horns.

The multiparameter optimization was done using a custom computer code mi-
noise based on the conjugate gradient technique (Ref.[7], sec. 10.6). The line
minimization algorithm was modiﬁed to handle uncertainty in the minimiza-
tion function (the transmission) due to statistical errors associated with the
Monte Carlo technique. Instead of bracketing and searching for the minimum
by golden means, the transmission is sampled at n points along the line, and

ﬁt for the parabolic minimum. The algorithm also has the capability to: a)
narrow the range if χ2 of the ﬁt is too large; b) zoom out if uncertainty in the
minimum is too large or the parabola has the wrong curvature; c) recenter the
range on the minimum, adding extra points to ﬁll in the gaps; and d) increase
the density of points for the ﬁnal ﬁt after ﬁnding the range. Because of the cost
of each Monte Carlo simulation, care was taken to reuse old points and only
do new simulations where necessary. In order to perform the 400 −1500 Monte
Carlo simulations necessary for a full parameter optimization, the neutrack
8.9 based ballistic guide simulation described in section 3.3 was executed from
an MPI [8] wrapper, and run in parallel on a 40 CPU farm. In this manner,
simulations of 200000 events could be run in less than 5 s each. The graphical
output of a minimization of 13 parameters is shown in Fig. 14. Diﬀerent colors
represent diﬀerent range-ﬁnding iterations.

Three optimizations were carried out, listed in Table 5. The ﬁrst optimization
was done to ﬁnd the optimal height of the guide, Y W 2 = 37.6 cm. This is
very close to the limit of 30 cm, and the transmission changed very little
to due this constraint. The second optimization veriﬁed the values of L and
a determined in the physics-motivated section, and showed that the guide
should be reasonably symmetric along its length. The third ﬁt, a full-parameter
optimization, improved very little over the previously obtained transmission.
This supports the above arguments that the guide performance is insensitive to
the details of its curvature, and shows that the guide is well-optimized for the
angular distribution of neutrons at the source. In fact, very little transmission
was gained by increasing the m-value of the supermirros in the diverging horn.

4 Summary

The design for the ballistic guide for the FNPB 8.9 ˚A neutron line was op-
timized using Monte Carlo simulation. A simulation program written using
neutrack 8.9, a neutron ray tracing package specially developed for this
purpose. It was shown that it is possible to increase the output neutron ﬂux
(and ﬂuence) by more than 70% (as compared to that obtained by the straight
guide) by using a ballistic guide with curved taper. With a properly designed
ballistic guide, a neutron ﬂuence of 1.65 ×109 n/s/˚A is expected, which should
be compared to 0.94 × 109 n/s/˚A, a ﬂuence expected for the straight guide.

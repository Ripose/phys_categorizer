We describe ﬁve high-voltage (60 to 550V peak to peak), high-speed (1-300 ns rise time; 1.3-
300 MHz bandwidth) linear ampliﬁers for driving capacitive or resistive loads such as electro-optic
modulators. The ampliﬁers use bipolar transistors in various topologies. Two use electron tubes
to overcome the speed limitations of high-voltage semiconductors. All ampliﬁers have been built.
Measured performance data is given for each.

INTRODUCTION

Electro–optic modulators (EOMs) [1, 2] are used for
amplitude,
frequency, and phase modulation of laser
beams and, for example, as actuators in optical frequency
and phase locked-loops. They typically require input
voltages in the range of Uπ = 50 − 500 V for generat-
ing an optical phase-shift of π. Because fast ampliﬁers
capable of driving modulators with these voltages are dif-
ﬁcult to make, the overall speed is usually limited by the
driver ampliﬁer.

The best (monolithic or hybride) operational ampliﬁers
achieve a slew rate [3] of dU/dt ∼ 5000 V/µs, but only at
low voltages of ±15 V. At high voltage, hybride op amps
achieve dU/dt ∼ 1000 V/µs at 400 Vpp (volts peak to
peak) output amplitude, i.e., rise-times of 400 µs and a
large signal bandwidth of 0.8 MHz [4]. Ampliﬁers based
on discrete MOSFETs [5, 6] achieve similar performance.
For example, ampliﬁers made by various companies pro-
vide up to 800 Vpp for sinewaves at frequencies up to
250 kHz, i.e., dU/dt = 600 V/µs, and twice the voltages
in a push-pull conﬁguration, where both electrodes are
driven by paraphase signals to double the voltage. In-
tegrated ampliﬁers for driving CRTs in high-resolution
monitors [7] achieve about 60Vpp output voltage and
3ns rise-time for low capacity loads (< 20 pF). EOMs
can also be driven by RF wide-band ampliﬁers, prefer-
ably in push-pull conﬁguration, but the output voltage
of these is generally limited to below 100 Vpp.

In applications like frequency and phase locked loops
for diode-, Titanium:sapphire-, or dye- [8] lasers, speed
and voltage demands can barely be fulﬁlled by existing
ampliﬁers; such setups can thus be improved (or simpli-
ﬁed) by an improved high-voltage ampliﬁer.

Electrically, an EOM represents a capacitive load of the
order of 10-150 pF. There is a tradeoﬀ between high speed
and high output voltage: because the current required to
charge the EOM and circuit capacity increases with fre-
quency and voltage, the power dissipation of ampliﬁers
based on a given technology is roughly proportional to
the bandwidth times the square of the maximum out-

put voltage; moreover, high voltage semiconductors tend
to be slower. In this article, we describe ﬁve ampliﬁers
that can drive capacitive loads with diﬀerent combina-
tions of high speed and output voltage. They use several
tricks to achieve high performance at moderate power
dissipation. In Sec. II A, we present a push-pull bipolar
transistor design which achieves 550 Vpp output voltage
and > 1.3 MHz bandwidth, about twice the one of high-
voltage operational ampliﬁers. Section II B describes an
ampliﬁer whose output voltage and bandwidth of 65 Vpp
and 75 MHz are comparable to those of high-resolution
CRT drivers, but that can drive loads of up to 100 pF.
Section II C describes a nanosecond rise-time push-pull
ampliﬁer for 60 Vpp. At high output voltages, one can
achieve improved performance by using electron tubes:
Section III A describes an ampliﬁer for a maximum out-
put voltage of 550 Vpp and > 5.7 ˙MHz bandwidth, more
than four times faster than our transistorized ampliﬁer
for 550 V. In Sec. III B, we describe a 140 Vpp ampliﬁer
for > 120 MHz bandwidth.

II. BIPOLAR TRANSISTOR DESIGNS

While MOSFETs are intrinsically very fast, their high
input and output capacity are signiﬁcant disadvantages
for their use as fast linear ampliﬁers. For example, an
ampliﬁer capable of generating 400Vpp output voltage
with 300V/µs slew rate is described in Ref. [6], intended
for the use as a piezo driver. It uses a MTP2P50E (p-
channel) and a IRF830 (n-channel) MOSFET, whose out-
put capacities add to 220 pF. While this is much lower
than the capacity of a typical piezo, it is greater than the
capacity of a typical EOM (100pF). Thus, when driving
an EOM, a large part of the ampliﬁer’s potential output
current is used to charge the internal capacities. This re-
duces the potential speed of MOSFET ampliﬁers. Bipo-
lar transistors, on the other hand, are available that have
< 3 pF output capacity.

A. 550 Vpp, 300ns diﬀerential ampliﬁer

∗Electronic address: holgerm@stanford.edu

This ampliﬁer (Fig. 1) uses a diﬀerential ampliﬁer con-
ﬁguration with complementary emitter followers for pro-

2

and BF761, that feature Ucb0 = 350 V, a maximum to-
tal power dissipation Ptot = 10 W, fT = 45 MHz and
about 3.5 pF output capacity. (These types seem to be
out of production, though they are still available in small
quantities. Tested substitutes that even lead to slightly
improved speed due to their lower capacities are 2SB1011
(pnp) and 2SC3063 (npn).) T8 and T9 operate as con-
stant current sources for the diﬀerential ampliﬁer. The
output signals are delivered to the load via two comple-
mentary emitter followers, one consisting of T1 and T5,
the other of T2 and T6. They are biased for class AB
operation by diodes 1N4148 to reduce the crossover dis-
tortion.

The gain is set to 100 by (R28 + R29)/R, where R
is the resistance of the network consisting of R16, R17,
and R21. The bandwidth of the ampliﬁer is determined
mainly by the low-pass ﬁlter formed by R28 = R29 and
the transistor and wiring capacity at the node at the
collectors of T3 or T4, respectively, that amounts to
about 15 pF. This gives a theoretical -3dB–bandwidth
B = 1/(2πRC) ≈ 1.1 MHz. The inductors L1 and L2 in-
crease the eﬀective load impedance at high frequencies,
which leads to a theoretical increase of the bandwidth by
∼ 40% with 1% overshoot [9]. An additional increase of
the bandwidth is provided by C5 and C16. The inductors
and capacitors are adjusted for optimum square-wave re-
sponse at a high signal voltage (500Vpp).

R28 and R29 dissipate about 2.25 W each at zero input
signal. However, they must be rated for 10 W so that
the ampliﬁer can be continuously operated with a DC
signal of full amplitude. T3 and T4 dissipate at most
2.25W each under all signal conditions; a small heat sink
(mounted with minimum stray capacity) is attached to
them. Each of T1, T2, T5, and T6 will dissipate 3.75 W
at full output voltage with a 500 kHz sinewave and 100 pF
load; cooling was provided by attaching the transistors
to the metal housing with an insulating layer.

The ampliﬁer was tested with an LM0202 EOM
(LINOS AG) as a load, that is speciﬁed to have 82 pF
capacity, connected via short (25cm) RG-58 cables (the
use of low-capacity types such as RG-63 should be pre-
ferred for longer cables). The results are summarized in
table I.

B. Single-ended 65 Vpp, 5ns ampliﬁer with
multiple output stages

EOMs made from materials such as lithium tanta-
late (LTA) can have Uπ < 50 V. Such voltages can, in
principle, be provided by integrated circuits intended for
driving cathode-ray tubes in high-resolution monitors [7].
However, while these work well with a low-capacity load
of around 10 pF, they cannot provide the output current
of 1.2 A peak that is required to drive a 100 pF load with
60 Vpp at 5 ns rise time. The ampliﬁer presented in Fig.
2 delivers up to 85 Vpp into a single ended 100 pF load
at less than 5 ns rise time.

viding a 550Vpp output voltage with relatively low power
dissipation. A positive and a negative signal each provide
half the output signal amplitude. With zero input signal,
the output voltage across the load is zero. This ampli-
ﬁer can be used for any loads that allow for a diﬀerential
drive, such as EOMs made by LINOS photonics.

The main building block is the diﬀerential ampliﬁer
consisting of T7 and T10. These transistors are con-
nected with T3 and T4, respectively, to form two cas-
code stages [4]. T7 and T10 act as current ampliﬁers.
They can be low-voltage types BFW16A that feature a
transition frequency ft > 1 GHz. Voltage ampliﬁcation
is done by T3 and T4, which must be high voltage types.
Since they operate in a common-base conﬁguration, their
transition frequency ft can be considerably lower with-
out degrading the overall speed. Moreover, they can
be used up to their Ucb0 voltage rating, which usually
is 20 to 50% higher than Uce0, the maximum value for
common-emitter conﬁguration. We choose types BF759

Since a single output stage cannot provide the neces-
sary current, we use four complementary emitter out-
put stages in parallel. Each can drive an individual
load of 25 pF. Combining their outputs, a single 100 pF
load can be driven. Without the emitter followers, the
ampliﬁer can drive a single 25 pF load connected di-
rectly to the emitter of T3. The output transistors BFQ
262 and BFQ 252, made for the video output stages of
high-resolution monitors, have a Vcb0 of 100 V (115V for
BFQ252A/BFQ262A), fT > 1GHz and collector-base ca-
pacities Ccb of 2.5 pF (BFQ252) and 2 pF (BFQ262), re-
spectively. They feature a 5 W power dissipation. The
emitter followers operate without bias in class B, which
causes some crossover distortion. When low distortion is
important, they can be biased for class AB as the output
emitter followers in Fig. 1.

The emitter followers are driven by a voltage ampli-
ﬁer output stage consisting of T1, T2, and T3. T1 and
T2 are arranged in a cascode conﬁguration, with the ad-
vantages discussed in Sec. II A. The load is connected
via the emitter follower T3. Since T3 can only source but
not sink current, with a capacitive load (such as the com-
plementary emitter follower output stages) the rise time
for negative voltage changes would be much longer than
for positive ones. Thus, the Schottky diode D2 has been
connected from the emitter of T3 to the collector of T2.
For positive voltage changes, D2 is reverse biased, but for
negative ones, T2 can sink current from the load through
D2. Thereby, negative voltage changes can be as fast as
positive without an additional transistor. Alternatively,
a complementary emitter follower could be connected to
T2’s collector, but then the collector-base capacities of
three (rather than two) transistors would contribute to
the capacity at T2’s collector, thus reducing the speed.
Circuits of this type are also used for driving cathode-ray
tubes in high-resolution monitors.

Adjustable DC bias (nominally 2.3V) is applied by T8
at the emitter of T1. Negative feedback via R9 and R10
sets the gain and gives the stage a low output impedance.
A common emitter ampliﬁer Q2 drives the stage. The
network at Q2’s emitter compensates for the gain loss
due to stray capacities parallel to R9 and R10 at high fre-
quencies. The input signal is terminated into 50 Ω (R4).
A pnp emitter follower Q1 drives the common emitter
ampliﬁer Q2; D1 shifts the DC level of the input voltage.

R11 must be mounted with low stray capacity. Since
the negative feedback reduces waveform distortions, such
as ringing, it may be a wire-wound type. Actually, the
inductance of a wire-wound resistor even improves the
risetime of this ampliﬁer by series peaking. Under quies-
cent conditions, T2 dissipates at most 3.5W. At 50MHz,
50Vpp and 25pF load per output, each of the emitter fol-
lower output transistors dissipates 2.5W. The ampliﬁer
was constructed with all BFQ252 and BFQ262 transis-

tors on a large common heat sink that also served as a
ground plane. To minimize the collector capacity of T2, a
shield (copper foil) was mounted between two mica insu-
lating layers between heat sink and T2. It was electrically
connected to the emitter of T3. The technical data of the
ampliﬁer is summarized in Table II.

Without the emitter followers, the output stage of this
ampliﬁer uses only npn transistors, which are available
with maximum voltages Ucb0 > 1kV. For example, two
BUX87-1100 transistors using a 700V supply and an out-
put resistance of 12.5kΩ could generate >600Vpp single
ended output voltage with > 1MHz large signal band-
width.

C. 60 Vpp nanosecond rise-time ampliﬁer with
electronic amplitude control

The ampliﬁer shown in Fig. 3 is designed for am-
plifying ECL level pulses, providing 60 Vpp pulses with
nanosecond rise time into a symmetric low capacity load.
The output amplitude can be adjusted continuously from
zero to 60 Vpp by a DC voltage.

The input stage is designed for amplitude control. It
is a diﬀerential ampliﬁer (Q1 and Q2) with an adjustable
constant-current source (Q4). The output amplitude is
adjustable with a voltage at the base of Q3 between -5 V
and -4 V. The collector capacity of the BFR182 transis-
tors is only a few tenths of pF, so R5 can have a relatively
high value of 100 Ω, provided that wiring capacities are
minimized.

An emitter follower Q5 provides a low impedance sig-
nal to the subsequent stage, a diﬀerential ampliﬁer con-
sisting of Q8 and Q9. It has threefold voltage gain. Its
load resistance must be as low as 33 Ω, since the more
powerful transistors have higher capacities. This stage
derives an adjustable supply voltage from Q7. Emit-
ter followers T1 and T2 using the relatively powerful
BFG235 transistor drive the power stage. Because of

the low impedances here and in the power stage, the lay-
out must be designed for low parasitic inductances. The
lead lengths to the bases of T16 and T17 have to be
made as short as possible, in order to reach the band-
width of above 300 MHz required for the short rise-time.
The BFG235s dissipate about 1W through their collector
connections.

The output capacity of the power transistors must be
as low as 6.6 pF to achieve the desired speed. They also
have to meet a demanding combination of voltage, cur-
rent, dissipation, and fT ratings. Only UHF power tran-
sistors satisfy these. Many devices, however, come with a
relatively narrow band internal impedance matching net-
work and are thus not usable for this application. Tran-
sistors BLW33 have been chosen.

To eliminate the Miller eﬀect (which would result in an
unrealistically small input impedance), a cascode conﬁg-
uration is the only choice. This has the additional ad-
vantage that the “upper” transistor can be utilized up to
Ucb0, which is crucial because of the relatively low maxi-
mum voltages of UHF transistors.

The power stage uses negative feedback by emitter re-
sistors. Each consists of ﬁve paralleled resistors (12 Ω
each) in order to minimize the parasitic inductance to
≪ 1nH. Also the resistors R29, 30, 31, and 42 must be
very low inductance types; suitable are those that come
in power transistor packages that can be mounted to a
heat sink. L1 and L2 compensate for the gain loss at high
frequencies; they consist entirely of resistor and wiring in-
ductances. The power stage dissipates 27 W. The power
resistors and transistors were mounted to heat sink. A
fan was used to keep the heat sink below 50◦C.

The technical data summarized in Tab. III refer to a
circuit driven from a high-speed ECL waveform with a
rise time < 0.3 ns. The load can be connected through
two 50 Ω coax cables of equal length. They are termi-
nated inside the ampliﬁer, so termination at the load is
unnecessary (and would reduce the output voltage to one
half).

III. ELECTRON-TUBE DESIGNS

Electron tubes are well suited suited for high-voltage
linear ampliﬁers. At a given output capacity, they pro-

vide higher power dissipation and current capabilities
than transistors (bipolar or MOSFET).

A. Single-ended 550 Vpp, 60 ns rise time ampliﬁer

The power stage of the ampliﬁer shown in Fig. 4 uses
two tubes: V1 to source current to the load and V2 to
sink current. The power stage is controlled by the con-
trol grid g1 of V2. Under quiescent conditions, this is
at about −23 V relative to its cathode. Its correspond-
ing anode current of Ia,0 = 85 mA causes a voltage drop
across R2 that causes a similar negative voltage of −23 V
at the control grid of V1 with respect to its cathode. If
V2 is driven to conduct lower current, there will be less
voltage drop across R2, causing V1 to conduct more cur-
If, on the other hand, V2 is conducting a large
rent.
current, V1 will be cut oﬀ by the voltage drop across R2.
Thus, the two tubes act as a push-pull ampliﬁer. The
circuit can therefore both source and sink peak currents
Ia,m of more than 800mA, substantially larger than the
quiescent current Ia,0 [11]. This makes a high slew rate
dU/dt possible at moderate power dissipation.

A diﬀerential ampliﬁer (T5 and T6) is used as driver
stage. The driver is signiﬁcantly faster than the power
stage. It uses the BFQ252 and BFQ262 described in sec-
tion II B. The power stage is driven by a complementary
emitter follower (T3 and T4).

Negative feedback over the power stage by R10 is used

to set the gain and provide a low output impedance.
The output stage without feedback acts like an integrator
(providing constant output current to a capacitive load).
Since the feedback is over the power stage and the much
faster emitter follower, the ampliﬁer does not get insta-
ble even with large capacitive loads. A small capacitor
in parallel to R10 stabilizes the ampliﬁer. It is eﬀectu-
ated by attaching a thin copper strap on the surface of
R10, that is connected to the output side of the resis-
tor. The overall gain of the ampliﬁer is set by R10/R11.
The high frequency compensation network consisting of
C9,C12,C13, and R21 compensates for the distributed
feedback capacity parallel to R10. R23 and L3 stabilize
the ampliﬁer for capacitive loads.

a. The g3-trick The slew rate of the ampliﬁer with-
out load Ia,0/C is given by the capacity C = C2+2Cag1 +
Cstray at the anode of V2, that consists of the output ca-
pacity C2 of V2, the anode-to-g1 capacity Cag1 = 2.5 pF
of V1 and V2, and stray capacities Cstray. The C2 of a
PL509 pentode is speciﬁed as 17pF with g3 connected
to cathode [12, 13], so C ≈ 25 pF if Cstray ≈ 3 pF. The
output capacity C2 of V2 can be reduced to 9 pF by the
’g3-trick’, i.e., by connecting the g3 of this tube to the
cathode via R3 rather than directly, which allows the
beam plate g3 to have a ﬂoating RF potential. C2 can
be further reduced by connecting this g3 to the output
(preferably through a 100 V Zener bypassed with a 10 nF
capacitor to make g3 negative with respect to the anode),
thereby practically eliminating the g3-to-anode contribu-

6

tion to the capacity. From the measured rise-time (Tab.
IV) and Ia,0 = 85 mA, C ≈ 12 pF can be calculated,
lower by a factor of over 2 compared to the above value,
i.e, C2 has been reduced fourfold to about 4 pF.

b. The Lk trick The maximum slew rate of the ca-
pacitively loaded ampliﬁer is proportional to the peak
anode current Ia,m, which charges the load and circuit
capacities. However, without L2, the slew rate for pos-
itive voltage steps at the output would be signiﬁcantly
lower, since the current required to charge the anode ca-
pacity of V2 is provided by V1 via R2. This current
causes a voltage drop across R2, which makes the grid of
V1 negative. This reduces the anode peak current that
is available from V1 and leads to a reduced speed of pos-
itive transitions. With L2, however, a sudden change in
the anode current of V2 cause a positive voltage spike at
the grid of V1. In the limit of a very large L2, a small
negative change of V2’s anode current will drive V1 fully
open (in fact, the grid voltage of the upper tube may
even get positive). The slew rate for positive edges is
thus increased. L2 is bypassed for negative edges by D4
and the 27V Zeners D3 and D4. The Zener is to allow a
≤ 27V drop across L2 for negative slopes, which is nec-
essary because the arithmetic mean of the voltage across
an inductance is always zero.

supplies

c. Power

and dissipation A Voltage-
doubler circuit (TR3,D10,D11,C15,C16) provides the
positive DC voltages. A negative supply is made by the
drop of the power stage’s anode current across D12. Reg-
ulation of the high–voltage supplies is not used because
the feedback across the power stage stabilizes the output
voltage in spite of power supply variations.

A ﬂoating power supply consisting of TR1 and associ-
ated components is used for the screen grid and heater
of V1. The ac heater voltage of 40 V and the screen
grid voltage of 100 V can be generated from a single 40 V
transformer and a voltage-doubler rectiﬁer (D1, D2, C3,
and C4). The dual choke L1 prevents the capacity of
Tr1’s secondary with respect to ground from loading the
output by providinbg a high RF impedance. R24 crit-
ically damps the series resonance of L1 and the trans-
former capacity. A similar (non-ﬂoating) power supply
(TR2 and associated components) produces heater and
screen grid voltge for V2. The transistor circuits are also
operated from this supply.

T1 and T2 act as shunt voltage regulator to provide
an adjustable 42 V bias voltage at the cathode of V2. It
uses -5V from the power supply as a reference.

With 400 Vpp sinusoidal output voltage at 3 MHz and
Cl = 140 pF (plus 30 pF wiring capacities), the power
stage draws about 200 mA average current. Under such

about 500 V and the power supply drain will be about
100 W. From these, about 40 W will be dissipated by each
tube, 8 W by T1, 3 W by R2, and 5.4 W each by D3 and
D4. The heat is removed by a fan.

d. Conclusion The performance of the ampliﬁer
with sine and square-wave signals is summarized in Tab.
IV and Tab. V. By using other tubes and/or other sup-
ply voltages, the circuit can be adapted to a wide range of
output voltage, load, and speed requirements. For exam-
ple, using forced-air cooled tetrodes type 4CX250B, am-
pliﬁers with 11 kV/µs slew rate are possible for 2000 Vpp
output voltage. On the other hand, downsized versions
of the circuit using smaller tubes are also possible. For
example, with PL504 tubes (whose g3 is connected in-
ternally to the cathode, i.e., the g3-trick unfortunately
doesn’t work here) at 2000 V supply voltage, 0.65 ˙kV/µs
are achieved for 120 pF loads.

capacity (10 pF) electro-optic modulator at 140 Vpp with

that can be directly attached to the EOM, eliminating
the cable capacity that would reduce the bandwidth. The

The QQE06/40 vacuum tube [13] is chosen for its low
output capacity for a tube of its rated power, and suf-
ﬁcient transconductance of about 20 mA/V at the oper-
ating point (set by R10), giving the ampliﬁer a voltage
gain of 16 dB. The maximum output voltage is about
140 Vpp with a supply of 180 V. This is reached with
about 30 dBm, or 20 Vpp drive level, that can be taken
from a commercial semiconductor ampliﬁer.

connected with minimum lead length from the cathode
to the end of the coaxial cable bringing in the signal,
rather than to the housing. Otherwise, the resonance of
this lead length would decrease the gain strongly above
100 MHz.

The circuit utilizes a LC compensation network to in-
crease the bandwidth from about 1/(2πRa(Ca + Cext)) =
26MHz (where Ca = 6.4pF is the output capacity of the
QQE06/40, Cext = 12pF is the sum of the EOM and
wiring capacities, and Ra = 330 Ω is the anode load re-
sistor) to 120 MHz [9]. The inductance of the paralleled
wire-wound resistors R5-7 as well as L1 compensate for
the gain loss at high frequencies due to the circuit and
EOM capacities (both are about 0.9µH). L1 is made of
10 windings of 0.3mm thick copper wire around the 1W
metal ﬁlm resistor R8, which removes a sharp spike in
the frequency response that would occur with a lossless
inductance here. The LC compensation as shown is op-
timized for a high bandwidth (140 MHz, see Fig. 6), but
leads to some overshot in the square-wave response and
a large phase-shift of 90◦ at 40 MHz. For some applica-
tions, like driving an actuator in phase locked loops, a
low phase shift is more important. The circuit may also
be optimized for low phase shift by setting L1 to zero
and increasing the inductance of the anode load resistors

to 2 µH. This reduces the bandwidth to 60MHz, but at
the same time reduces the phase shift to 45◦ at 32 MHz,
corresponding to a delay of td = 4ns.

The technical data of this ampliﬁer is summarized in
table VI. The load used for this measurement was 10 pf
connected via an SMA connection that adds about 2 pF.

[3] Rise time: time between the 10% and 90% points of the
rising edge of a square wave; fall time: time between
the 10% and 90% points of the falling edge of a square
wave; delay: time required for the output voltage of an
ampliﬁer to reach 50% of its ﬁnal value relative to the
instant at which a square pulse of negligible rise time is
applied at the input. (3dB-) Bandwidth: frequency where
the output amplitude of an ampliﬁer driven by sinewaves
of constant amplitude is reduced to 1/√2, or -3dB, of its
maximum.

and the screen grid voltage. In this circuit, above 800mA
are reached with PL509 tubes as speciﬁed in the origi-
nal data sheets [12, 13], but some tubes of present day
construction provide lower peak current and are thus not
suitable.

The results of the test measurements of the harateristis of 2200 PMT

for the Borexino experiment provide the most omplete information for the

evaluation of the ETL9351 timing harateristis with a high preision. The

unique timing harateristis of the apparatus used and the large statistis

aumulated during the tests of the PMTs to be used in the future Borexino

experiment, allow to resolve a (cid:28)ne struture of the PMT timing response.

A method to obtain the probability density funtion of the single pho-

toeletron ounting from the experimental data is proposed and applied to

derive the PMT average harateristis. For the (cid:28)rst time, an analytial

model of the single photoeletron PMT time response is proposed, desribing

all the features of the single photoeletron time arrival. The origin of the

small amplitude pulses is explained.

Introdution

Photomultipliers with a large area spherial photoathode are being widely used

in many liquid sintillator and water herenkov rare events detetors. All reently

developed solar neutrino detetors, suh as SNO [1℄, KamiokaNDE [2℄, KamLAND

[3℄, Borexino [4℄ and its Counting Test Faility [5℄, are based on the sintillation

photons ounting tehniques. The interation point in these detetors is reon-

struted using timing information from a large number of PMTs. Depending on the

preision of reonstrution and the total number of PMTs the preision of single

photoeletron detetion at the level of 1 ns is demanded. The Monte Carlo sim-

ulation of the Borexino detetor showed that the mean number of photoeletrons

(p.e.) registered by one PMT in a sintillation event will be in the region 0.02

2.0

−

for an event with energy of 250-800 keV. Hene the PMTs should demonstrate a

good single eletron performane. After preliminary tests, the ETL 9351 with a

large area photoathode (8(cid:17)) has been hosen [7℄. The PMT of this model has 12

dynodes with a total gain of k = 107
response is 1

−

1.5 ns. The PMT has a good energy resolution haraterized by the

. The transit time spread of the single p.e.

manufaturer by the peak-to-valley ratio. The manufaturer (Eletron Tubes Lim-

ited, ETL) guarantees a peak-to-valley ratio of 1.5. The results of the preliminary

tests with 50 PMTs have been reported in [6℄.

2 PMT test faility at LNGS

In the Borexino programme the speial PMT test faility was prepared at LNGS.

The test faility is plaed in two adjaent rooms. In one room the eletronis is

mounted, and the other is a dark room with 4 tables designed to hold up to 64

PMTs. The dark room is equipped with an Earth's magneti (cid:28)eld ompensation

system using retangular oils with an eletri urrent ([11℄). The non-uniformity

of the ompensated (cid:28)eld in the plane of the tables is no more than 10%. The tables

are separated from eah other by blak shrouds, whih sreen any light re(cid:29)eted

from the PMTs photoathode.

The simpli(cid:28)ed sheme of one hannel of eletronis (out of the total 32) of the

test faility is presented in Fig.1. The system uses the modular CAMAC standard

eletronis and is onneted to a personal omputer by the CAEN C111 interfae.

The PMT harateristis are normally measured during a 5 hour run.

The PMTs are illuminated by low intensity light pulses from a laser. A piose-

ond Hamamatsu pulse laser was used in the tests. The model used has a peak

power of 0.39 mW , the pulse width is 27.3 ps, and the laser wavelength is 415 nm,

whih is lose to the maximum sensitivity of the ETL 9351 photoathode. The light

pulse from the laser is delivered by 6 meter long optial (cid:28)bers into the dark-room.

Eah of the 4 (cid:28)bers is supplied with a di(cid:27)user in order to provide a more uniform

illumination of the tables.

The TDC, CAEN mod.C414, (cid:16)start(cid:17) signals are generated using the laser internal

trigger(cid:11) whih has negligible time jitter (< 100 ps) with respet to the light pulse.

The (cid:16)stop(cid:17) signal for the TDC is formed by the onstant fration disriminator

(CFD, ORTEC mod.CCF8200) with the threshold set at the 0.2 p.e.

level. The

full sale of TDC was set to 200 ns with 2048 hannels resolution. Beause of the

memory restritions of the software, only the part of the full range was used, namely

100 ns in the region [-30 ns;+70 ns℄ around the main peak in the PMT transit time.

The 32-input ma jority logi unit, LeCroy mod.4532, is able to memorize the

3

pattern of the hit hannels. This information signi(cid:28)antly inreases the data pro-

essing rate. The reading of the eletronis is ativated when the ma jority LAM

signal is on (a LAM is produed if one of the signals on the input is inside the

external GATE on the ma jority logi unit). Otherwise, a hardware lear is fored

using the ma jority OUT signal. Every pulse of the laser is followed by an internal

trigger. The trigger is used as the ma jority external gate.

A high preision alibration of eah eletronis hannel had been performed

before the measurements. Here alibration means the preise knowledge of the

response to a signal orresponding to 1 p.e.

on the system input. The PMT in this

1

measurement was substituted by a preision harge generator LeCroy mod. 1976.

The gain of eah PMT eletron multiplier was set to a value of 2

, before

the tests with a help of automated gain adjustment system, desribed in [12℄.

3 Results of the 2000 PMT testing

The main timing harateristis de(cid:28)ned during the aeptane tests were:

t0 and σt

rms

plate

pprep

the position and the rms of the gaussian (cid:28)tting the main peak in the

transit time distribution. The (cid:28)t had a an additional onstant orre-

sponding to the dark noise level;

is estimated for all transit time histogram (up to 90 ns);

late pulsing in perent, estimated as the ratio of the events in the [t0 +
3

σt; 100] ns range to the total number of the events;

·
prepulsing in perent, estimated as the ratio of the events in the [0; t0 −
3
·

σt] ns range to the total number of the events.

The results of measurements showed no essential problems with the transit time

spread of the PMTs, with PMTs rejeted mainly or beause of the high dark rate or

beause of the bad amplitude response of the PMT. As a rule a PMT with a good

single photoeletron harge response has also a good timing response.

The results of the measurements are presented in Table 1. For future use we

put also in this table the parameter pU , whih is the fration of the underampli(cid:28)ed

signals in the amplitude spetrum of the single photoeletron response. The model

multiplied by a fator of 107

in [8℄. The underampli(cid:28)ed signals an be desribed well with an exponential with

a negative slope A =

measurements with a threshold (Th) set to 0.16 p.e. uts 61% of the underampli(cid:28)ed

signals, leaving 6.4% of the total 16.5%.

The distribution of the t0 , σt and rms parameters is a normal distribution with
a sigma oiniding with the rms of distribution. The distributions for plate and pprep

have longer non-gaussian tails. All these results have been written in a database,

whih an be used for the detetor modeling.

An important harateristi of the PMT is the dependene of the peak of the

transit time t0 on the applied voltage, see Fig.2. The shift of the t0 position due
to a hange in the voltage applied is 0.02 ns/V. This value an be used in order to

equalize the time arrival of photoeletrons after eah adjustment of the high voltage.

4 The averaged transit time shape

The straightforward use of the database, with a set of parameters for eah PMT, for

the detetor's modeling will unneessary slow down the alulations, beause of the

huge number of PMTs (2200) used in the experiment. The alulation speed an be

improved using average harateristis of the PMTs instead of the individual ones.

Beause every PMT operates at its own voltage, and the lighting onditions depends

on the position on the test tables, the proedure of averaging should be preeded

by the equalizing the di(cid:27)erene in the onditions. Fortunately, the statistis of the

(cid:28)rst photoeletron ounting provides this possibility.

4.1 Statistis of the (cid:28)rst photoeletron time arrival

With any experimental onditions, the PMT does not register single photoele-

tron, and so the single photoeletron response should be extrated from a PMT

4.2 Correting for the random oinidene with a dark noise

The laser system has been tuned to provide mean ounting rate of the PMTs µ
≃
0.05 p.e.; this ondition ensures a mostly single p.e. regime for the PMT (with the
relative probabilty of the signal originating from 2 p.e. and more r = P (n>1)
P (n>0) =
1−e−µ−µe−µ

µ
2 , i.e. 2.5 %). With suh a small amount of light in a pulse, the PMT

1−e−µ ≃

response ould be a(cid:27)eted by the dark noise of the PMT, whih is of the order of

some kHz. The probability of the random oinidenes due to the dark noise fdark
in the time window τ an be expressed by

and the total amount of dark noise ounts in eah bin of the histogram (of the

total Nbins ) is

frndm = fdark ·

τ,

Ndark(i) = NT riggers

frndm
Nbins

.

In order to take orretly into aount the random noise in the system one should

substitute Nexp(i) by Nexp(i)-Ndark(i) in equations (5) and (6).

The dark noise in the system is measured independently with high preision

using salers.

4.3 The proedure used to obtain the mean harateristis

of the PMT

1. Using the measured value of the dark rate the ontribution Ndark of the ran-

dom oinidenes at one bin was alulated.

2. Using equations (5) and (6) with Nexp(i) substituted by Nexp(i)-Ndark(i) the

8

N1(i) funtion was alulated and normalized:

n1 =

N1(i)
Nbins
i=1 N1(i)

.

P

(7)

As follows from (7), the knowledge of the mean number of the registered pho-

toeletrons is not neessary for the alulation of the normalized probability.

3. The peak in the distribution n1 is found and the histogram is shifted in order

to put its maximum at the position orresponding to t = 0.

4. All the histograms are summed together and normalized to 1 one more. The

obtained histogram ontains the mean harateristis of the sample of the

PMTs used with a peak (not mean time of the arrival) at the position t = 0.

The resulting histogram is presented in Fig.3. This is the PMT transit time p.d.f.

averaged over a 2000 PMT sample.

5 The struture of the photomultiplier transit time

The following features of the transit time urve an be learly seen in Fig.3: 1)almost

gaussian peak at the position t = 0 ns; 2)a very weak peak at t =
24 ns; 3)a weak
peak at t = 48 ns; 4)the ontinuous distribution of the signals arriving between
the main peak and the peak at t = 48 ns; 5)another very weak peak at t = 20 ns.

−

All these features, together with others appearing with loser investigation of the

urve, will be explained in the urrent setion.

5.1 Main peak

The (cid:28)ne struture of the main peak an be seen in Fig.4. The main peak has almost

gaussian shape, but at the regions t > 2 ns and t <

2 ns the deviation from

−

the gaussian distribution is signi(cid:28)ant. Early pulses an arrive due to the elasti

sattering of the photoeletron on the (cid:28)rst dynode without multipliation, in suh

a way arriving at the next stage of the eletron multiplier earlier than seondaries

do. The same proess an our on the seond dynode, third et. The energy of the

eletron arriving at the (cid:28)rst dynode is de(cid:28)ned by the potential di(cid:27)erene between

the photoathode and the (cid:28)rst dynode UD1 . The UD1 voltage is onstant in the

divider sheme used, whih is provided by three Zenner diodes of 200 V eah. The

energy gained by the elastially sattered eletron at the seond stage is small in

omparison to the initial 600 eV , thus the veloity of the eletron in the sequene

of the elasti satterings an be onsidered onstant in (cid:28)rst approximation, as well

as the transit time between the (cid:28)rst dynodes. The arriving of the early signals

an be modeled by a set of the equidistant gaussians with the same spread and

geometrially dereasing strength:

The pulses just after the main peak are due to the inelasti sattering on the

(cid:28)rst dynode.

Let us introdue a set of variables, desribing the relative probabilities of the

on the (cid:28)rst dynode. The amplitude of these pulses is fator g1(ampli(cid:28)ation of the

(cid:28)rst dynode) less then the amplitude of the main peak. Beause a typial value is

g1 ≃

p.e.

level. The shape of the peak is well approximated by a gaussian (see Fig.6)

with a parameters given in Table 3.

5.3 Late pulses

Pulses arriving after the main pulse, in the time range up to 100 ns, are alled late

pulses. The struture of the late pulses spetrum an be seen in Fig.7. We are not

onsidering here pulses arriving in the miroseonds interval, whih are aused by

the ion-feedbak. In literature these pulses are alled afterpulses.

The shape of the late pulses is modeled well with a sum of 3 funtions of the

type given in equation (9).

The parameters of the best (cid:28)t are presented in Table 4. It should be noted that

the funtion M(t) desribing the main peak has been (cid:28)xed during the (cid:28)t of the late

pulses shape.

The peak with probability pr = 5.8

at t = 20.23 ns is aused by the

light feedbak on the laser optial splitter system. The light guide of about 1.5 m

delivers photons from the laser head to the optial splitter. On the output of the

light guide there is a lens fousing light on the bunh of light guides, whih in turn

σ = 1.07 ns oinides with a main peak spread. This peak was extrated from the

(cid:28)nal shape.

The remaining late pulses shape is desribed by three funtions given by equa-

tion (9) type, two with negative and one with a positive slope (signs in eq. (9) are

inverted). The position of the last peak helps in larifying its origin. The di(cid:27)erene

between the position of the last peak and the main peak is ∆t = 47.6 ns

3

, and it is

in perfet oinidene with a double drift time obtained in the previous subsetion:

2td = 47.2 ns. The double drift time an be explained by eletrons wih elasti-

ally satter on the (cid:28)rst dynode eletrons, then go away from the dynode, slows

down and stops near the photoathode, and then go bak to the (cid:28)rst dynode to

produe a signal. The amplitude of this pulses should be the same as that of the

main peak pulses, whih is on(cid:28)rmed in [13℄ by measuring the transit time of the

PMT with a higher threshold. The total probability to observe elastially sattered

photoeletron is pel = 0.024.

Two remaining ontributes with a negative slope orresponds to an inelasti

sattering of the photoeletron on the (cid:28)rst dynode, without any seondaries pro-

dued. In this ase, part of initial energy of the inident eletron is dissipated as

heat in the material of the dynode, and the drift time of the eletron in this ase

depends on the remaining part of the energy, and, naturally, is less than in the ase

of elasti sattering. In the extreme ase all the energy is dissipated, and, without

any delay, the eletron is transferred to the next stage of ampli(cid:28)ation, produing

on average a signal with an amplitude of fator g1 smaller than a normal signal.

In the intermediate ase, the sattered eletron is delayed by the time in the range

2td , and after returning bak to the (cid:28)rst dynode produes a signal with lower

0

−

amplitude in omparison to the amplitudes of the main peak signals. The smaller

is the delay the smaller is the amplitude of the signal.

The total amount of the inelastially sattered photoeletrons an be de(cid:28)ned

summing these two ontributes to the late pulses. The summing gives a value pin =
0.038, i.e. almost 4% of all registered signals are the signals of small amplitudes

due to inelastially sattered photoeletrons. This value is less than a value of 6.4%

obtained in setion 3 using the values of pU , A and the TDC threshold from Table

small angle.

We are using here results of the separate (cid:28)t of the position of the last peak with a gaussian.

The parameter tel from the Table 4 an't be used in this estimation, beause the model funtion

(9) gives .. of the many individual ontributions. For example the funtion of the form (9) an be

used to (cid:28)t the early pulses shape instead of (8) with a same result.

16

1. A ontribution of 8.4% from the main peak (cid:28)t..... This observations leads to a

onlusion that the underampli(cid:28)ed part of the signals is mainly due to the totally

inelasti sattering on the (cid:28)rst dynode with a minimal delay. The amplitude of the

pulses arriving at t > 5 ns is bigger than a threshold set. In fat, when (cid:28)tting the

harge spetrum of the PMT with a sum of exponential and gaussian terms, the

valley between them remains under(cid:28)lled.

The proposed model (cid:28)ts well the observed distribution; nevertheless, the statis-

tis are so high that some further features of the transit time of elastially sattered

photoeletrons an be noted. At the inreasing part of the elasti peak there is a

small bump in the region of 41 ns (see Fig.8). The amount of this pulses is very

small, but the bump is pronouned. These are the photoeletrons, elastially sat-

tered from the fousing grid before the (cid:28)rst dynode. These eletrons an reah

the photoathode, and after the elasti sattering on the photoathode, or possible

multipliation on it it will arrive to the (cid:28)rst dynode with an energy of the normally

aelerated eletrons. In the ase of multipliation on the photoathode this results

in a bigger amplitude signals. This an partially explain the non-gaussian tails

observed in the harge distribution of the single photoeletron signals.

6 Disussions

The method proposed for the deonvolution of the PMT signal an be used as well

to extrat the time deay urve of the liquid sintillator, using the data obtained

with the start-stop measurements with TDC.

No signals have been observed at the position orresponding to the single drift

time of photoeletron td , that would have been present in the ase of generation of

luminisent photons or gamma-rays on the (cid:28)rst dynode by an inident photoele-

tron, without produing seondaries. The presense of the small peak, nearly at the

same position due to the re(cid:29)etions in the light splitting system gives a possibility

to estimate the sensitivity of our setup to this kind of proess at the level of 10−5
(one should note, that the peak with a probability 5.8

10−4

is learly seen, and the

·

position of the hypothetial peak is known).

The good knowledge of the PMT timing response an help the manufaturer

in improving the PMT timing harateristis. From the point of view of the ex-

perimentor, a good knowledge of the PMT response is neessary for the proper

modeling of the detetor response, and in most pratial ases one an simplify the

model, keeping only the main ontributions to the signal. In Fig.9 are shown PMT

responses modeled with a ρ1(t) funtion and with a funtion M(t) without the early
pulses term. One an see that the funtion M(t) fails to desribe the PMT timing
response, and the funtion ρ1(t) pratially oinide with ρ(µ, t), re(cid:29)eting the fat,

that the PMT operates mainly in a single p.e. regime.

Another ase is illustrated in Fig.10. The PMT is registering on average µ = 5

p.e. The tail in the PMT transit time distribution is suppressed by more than one

order of magnitude, and the ρM (t) funtion gives a satisfatory desription of the
t > 0 ns part of the distribution. But this time, the early pulses should be taken

into aount in order to have a good model of the early oming pulses.

We an onlude, that the multiple p.e. signal an be modeled with a main

peak part of the total distribution, given by equation (10). In the ase of a single

photoeletron ounting the best result an be obtained using the ρ1(t) funtion.

The prepulses at t =

24 ns stays far away from the main peak, and with a

−

proper treatment an be easily separated. The amplitude of these pulses is small,

struture of the PMT timing response.

A method to obtain the probability density funtion of the single photoeletron

ounting from the experimental data is proposed and applied to derive the PMT

average harateristis. For the (cid:28)rst time an analytial model of the single photo-

eletron time arrival in a PMT is proposed, desribing all the features of the single

photoeletron time arrival. The origin of the small amplitude pulses, as well as a

non-gaussian tail in the amplitude response of PMT are explained.

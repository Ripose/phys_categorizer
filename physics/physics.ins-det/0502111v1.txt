Abstract

Time of ﬂight of a minimum ionizing particle along a ﬁxed base has
been measured with a 100 ps accuracy by means of a Dielectric Resistive
Plate Chamber (DRPC) with 4 × 0.3 mm gas gaps. DRPC timing charac-
teristics have been studied with diﬀerent applied voltages, discriminating
thresholds and beam intensities. It may be stated that the time-of-ﬂight
resolution of gaseous detectors developed within the ALICE experiment
has reached the level of the best known scintillation counters.

During the last several years a revolutionary progress in breakdown sup-
pression inside gaseous time-of-ﬂight detectors was achieved by introducing, in
diﬀerent ways, a resistivity inside the gas gap [1, 2, 3]. Despite of this fact, there
was a poor idea about timing properties, which may be principally manifested
by these detectors.

A value of 100 ps seems to be a natural limit in this sence. Basing on the AL-
ICE physical conditions, 100 ps time-of-ﬂight resolution is suﬃcient for π/K/p
separation in a real momenta range. Untill recently, such ﬁne resolution could
be provided only by modern scintillation counters and Pestov spark counters [4].
As an example, the timing system based on scintillators and photomultipliers,
proposed for the STAR project at RHIC, provides the time resolution of about
90 ps [5].

The detector, described in the given paper, is schematically presented in
Fig. 1. Dielectric Resistive Plate Chamber (DRPC) consists of several ceramic
plates (0.5 mm of ordinary unpolished ceramics) which form four gas gaps, each
0.3 mm wide. In accordance with the expectations, decreasing the gap width
has led to the rise of the time resolution. The number of gaps (two in previous
version [2]) was doubled to keep the MIP registration eﬃciency close to 100%.
The chamber consists of two types of electrodes. Ceramic cathodes are met-
allized with aluminum. Dielectric-resistive electrodes are also made of ceramics
metallized with aluminum on the one side and covered, through evaporation,

with semi-conducting SiC on the other side. The plates are assembled in pairs
so that the metal layer, common for two gaps, is positioned inside, and the semi-
conducting layers are turned towards the gaps. The idea of electrical connection
between the semi-conductor and the metal is described in Ref. [2]. The detector
has a square working surface of 2 × 2 cm2.

Methods employed in the measurements of TOF resolution and registration
eﬃciency at ITEP and CERN accelerators was, in general, similar to that de-
cribed in Ref. [2]. The same front-end electronics and gas mixture consisting
of 85%C2H2F4 + 5%isobutane + 10%SF6 were used. The start part of the
setup, based on scintillation counters, was modiﬁed, so that the information
from several detectors could be analized simultaneously.

The counting rate, or eﬃciently registered particle ﬂux over the working
surface, is an important parameter of DRPC. During the measurements the rate
was ﬁxed at the level of 1 kHz·s−1·cm−2, which is higher than that predicted
under the ALICE conditions (100–200 Hz·s−1·cm−2). Special measurements of
the way the time resolution dependends on the rate were performed as well.

A typical time-of-ﬂight distribution, summarised over the whole range of
amplitudes, with the total registration eﬃcincy close to 95%, is shown in Fig. 2a.

One can see that the standard deviation is really on the level of 100 ps, and the
distribution has unsigniﬁcant tails. Fig. 2b represents the same data in more
detail: the time resolution is shown for diﬀerent amplitudes. The dependence is
very slight, the resolution stays close to 100 ps in the whole range of amplitudes,
which explains the absence of tails in Fig. 2a.

spectrum.

Actually, the timing resolution is calculated after slewing correction, which
takes into account the fact that signals with larger amplitudes are triggered by
the constant-threshold discriminator at earlier times. Such a correction inﬂu-
ences the timing distribution in a strong way. It is normally performed with a
polynomial function in a way shown in Fig. 3a.

The amplutude spectrum obtained from the ampliﬁer output is shown in
Fig. 3b. More speciﬁcally, it shows the charge integrated by a charge-sencitive
ADC. Although the front-end electronics is not linear in the whole range of
amplitudes, it may be seen that the amplitude spectrum has a peak, staying

far from the pedestal bounder on a slightly changing background. Amplitude
magnitudes correspond to the gas ampliﬁcation of 107 and allow to obtain excel-
lent registration eﬃciency at diﬀerent high voltages and electronics thresholds.
The dependence of eﬃciency on the high voltage is shown in Fig. 4 for diﬀerent
electronics thresholds. Even at the threshold of 100 mV there is a clear plateau,
in which the eﬃciency stays close to 100%.

Figure 6: DRPC TOF resolution at diﬀerent counting rates.

All the results described above were obtained at a ﬁxed counting rate. A
special experiment was performed to study the rate inﬂuence on the detector
properties. Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the TOF resolution on the particle
ﬂux at 40 mV electronics threshold. The resolution increases with the rate up
to approximately 150 ps. But under the ALICE conditions (the very beginning
of the scale) it may be expected to be as low as 80 ps. Fig. 7 shows the low rate
resolution in detail. The distribution is still very clear with the tails admixture
being less than 10−3.

Abstract

÷

A Shashlyk calorimeter prototype for the KOPIO experiment has been con-
E(GeV)
structed and experimentally tested. The energy resolution of about 4%/
for 0.5
2.0 GeV/c positrons was obtained. Based on this results as well as on
the results of special measurements, a Monte-Carlo model of the Shashlyk module
response was developed. This model, including the eﬀects of shower evolution, light
collection in scintillator plates, light attenuation in ﬁbers, quantum eﬃciency of
the photodetector, thresholds and noises in the readout system is consistent with
experimental results. Possible improvment of the Shashlyk energy resolution up to
3%/

E(GeV), the level required by KOPIO experiment, are discussed.

1 Introduction.

The KOPIO experiment [1] at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)
Alternating Gradient Sinchrotron (AGS) is designed to measure the decay rate
for K 0
π0ν ¯ν, a “gold plated” CP-violating process [2]. This experiment
will provide the cleanest determination of the fundamental parameter that
quantiﬁes the phenomenon of CP violation in the context of the Standard
Model. A measured decay rate very diﬀerent from the precise expectation of

Shashlyk based calorimeter meets the speciﬁed requirements in an economical
way. Such a calorimeter is composed of Shashlyk modules, which are lead-
scintillator sandwiches read out by means of Wave Length Shifting (WLS)
ﬁbers passing through the holes in scintillator and lead.

→

The ﬁrst Shashlyk calorimeter was designed and manufactured at Institute for
Nuclear Research (Moscow) [3] in 1991 for the experiment 865 [4] (Search for
π+µ+e−) at the BNL AGS. During
the Lepton Number Violating Decay K +
the ﬁve-year high intensity run of the experiment, the Shashlyk calorimeter
was a very stable and reliable detector. Its features, together with its low cost
and well understood method of construction, make this type of calorimeter a
good candidate for other experimental projects. Similar calorimeters were built
later for PHENIX experiment at RHIC (BNL) [5] and for HERA-B experiment
at DESY [6]. A Shashlyk calorimeters was also studied as a candidate for the
CMS experiment at LHC (CERN) [7], and one is now under construction for
LHCb experiment [8].

The E865 and other constructed calorimeters were designed to have an en-
ergy resolution about 8%/qE(GeV). Signiﬁcant improvements in calorime-
ter module construction can be made it possible to achieve the resolution

3%/qE(GeV) required by experiment KOPIO.

∼

The purpose of this paper is to study the ways of such an upgrade. Based
on experience with the E865 module, a new prototype module has been de-
signed, constructed and tested. As will be shown below this module provides
an energy resolution about 4%/qE(GeV). While this improved resolution is
not suﬃcient to meet the requirements of KOPIO, experimental studies of this
module provide a reference point for tuning Monte-Carlo simulations. From
such simulations, recommendations for constructing a Shashlyk calorimeter
for KOPIO are made.

2 Design of KOPIO prototype module.

The design of a prototype module for KOPIO is shown in Fig. 1. Eighteen
such modules had been produced at TECHNOPLAST (Vladimir, Russia).

2.1 Mechanical construction of module

×

The module is a sandwich of alternating perforated stamped lead and injection
molded polystyrene-based scintillator plates. The transverse size of module is
110 mm2; the thicknesses of plates are 0.35 mm for lead and 1.5 mm
110
for scintillator. Each plate has 144 holes equidistantly arranged as 12
12
matrix, with the spacing between the holes being 9.5 mm. The diameters of
the holes are 1.5 mm in the lead plates, while the holes in the scintillator have
a conical shape with diameter ranging from 1.4 to 1.5 mm. 72 WLS ﬁbers are
inserted into these holes. Each ﬁber is looped at the front of the module, so
that both ends of a ﬁber are viewed by the photo-multiplier tube (PMT). Less
than 10% of light is lost while passing the loop, which radius is about 3 cm.
The ﬁber ends are collected in one bunch, cut and polished, and connected
to a PMT. To improve the light collection 60 µm perforated white reﬂecting
paper (TYVEK) is interleaved between lead and scintillator plates, and edges
of scintillator plates are aluminized. The complete stack of all plates is held in
compression by the four 50 µm stainless steel side strips that are pretensioned
and welded to both front and back special endcaps.

2.2 WLS ﬁbers and PM tubes

We have used three diﬀerent types of ﬁbers (KURARAY, 1 mm diameter
Y11(200)M-DC, and BICRON, 1 mm diameter BCF-99-29A-SC and 1.2 mm
diameter BCF-92-SC) and diﬀerent types of PMT’s (Russian FEU85 and
FEU115, and 9903B of Electron Tubes Ltd (9903B)) for the tests.

The properties of WLS ﬁbers used in our measurements are summarized in
Table 2. These data were taken from manufacturer’s Catalogs. Experimental
measurements [9] of the absorption spectra of WLS ﬁbers in comparison with
emission spectra of the scintillators are shown in Fig. 2.

FEU85 is an eleven stages green-extended one inch PM tube with a good
quantum eﬃciency for green light (Q.E.
15-20 %). The maximum anode

2.3 Light collection

Electrons and positrons from an electromagnetic shower produce ultraviolet
and blue light in the scintillator plates which is absorbed and reemitted as
green light in the WLS ﬁber. About 10% of the green light is captured and
transmitted by the ﬁber.

Due to the Shashlyk design, only light satisfying the criteria of a total internal
reﬂection within the scintillator plate is captured by ﬁbers. Since scintillator
plates are thin compared to the average distance of light to the ﬁbers, many

reﬂections from the surface of scintillator occur. Thus, high reﬂection eﬃciency
is very important for good performance. An internal reﬂection eﬃciency about
93% is achievable for realistic surfaces. It should also be noted that modern
technologies allow comparable diﬀusion reﬂection eﬃciencies to be realized by
special chemical treatment of the surfaces [11].

Light collection uniformity in the direction transverse to the length of the
module is also important in achieving good energy resolution. This requires
good reﬂectivity at the edges of the scintillator plates since the total internal
reﬂection at these surfaces is not necessary condition for the possibility of light
penetrating to ﬁber. Thus the scintillator edges were aluminized to increase
light reﬂection.

3 Experimental study of prototype module

÷

The characteristics of the modules were studied on B2 test beam at AGS
2 GeV/c positrons and pions. Measurements were done during the
with 0.5
Spring and Fall test runs 1998. The prototype of calorimeter (3
3 modules)
was mounted on a platform which could be moved horizontally and vertically
with respect to the beam line. Upstream of the calorimeter, a trigger counter
telescope was installed which consisted of three beam deﬁning scintillators

×

6

(S1 - S3) and a 2X0 veto lead-scintillator counter with a 15 mm diameter hole
through which the beam passed. A Cerenkov counter was used for identiﬁca-
tion of positrons.

The signals from PM tubes were read out using an 80 ns wide gate with a
LeCroy 1885 FASTBUS ADC providing 12 bits of dynamic range. A separate
channel, including a PM tube without a Shashlyk module and located inside
the detector box, was used to check for channel to channel coherent noise
correlations. It was often found that the coherent noise was very high. A
possible explanation of this eﬀect is that there was no “clean ground” in the
test beam area. The data from the runs with increased coherent noise were
skipped in the oﬀ-line analysis.

Three types of triggers were used during the beam tests for monitoring and
data taking : a random trigger to monitor pedestal behavior and to check noise
correlations, and two beam triggers (with and without the veto counter) for
measurements.

Each module was individually calibrated using either the minimum ionization
peak from high momentum pions, or the deposited energy peak from 1 GeV
positrons. In each calibration measurement about 5000 particles were passed
through the central region of each module at normal incidence. Using these
data, the calibration coeﬃcients were estimated with precision better than
1%.

The energy resolution was determined only for positrons passing through the
1

1 cm2 area in the center calorimeter as deﬁned by S3 scintillator.

×

The momentum spread of the beam signiﬁcantly contributed to the apparent
energy resolution in the modules at all measured energies. For beam momen-
tums above 1 GeV/c, the spread was about 1%. However, according to a
GEANT [10] calculation, 0.5 GeV positrons passing through matter (15 m of
Air and 3.5 cm of scintillation counters) lose about 15 MeV of their energy
with ﬂuctuations of about σ
10 MeV. This energy loss required signiﬁcant
corrections to the results of the measurements.

∼

The intensity of beam was chosen suﬃciently low to reduce pile-up and rate
eﬀects during the spill, but due to the large beam size this requirement was
only partially met. The beam particle rates for a nonet of modules were (50
÷
100)K per spill. Small corrections for pile-up and rate eﬀects were taken into
account in data analysis.

The electronic noise term for the nonet of modules was measured during spe-
cial test when calorimeter was removed from the beam. Its contribution to
the energy resolution of the nonet is 5
1 MeV for FEU85 PM tubes (with
preampliﬁers) and it is 2

1 MeV for other PM’s (without preampliﬁers).

÷

±

The sum of electronic noise and pile-up eﬀect for the nonet was measured in
other special beam test with the trigger gate for the ADC shifted by about
300 ns. The contribution of this eﬀective noise to the energy resolution was
10.3
1.3 MeV for FEU115 PM tubes. This value is somewhat larger than
expected from pile-up eﬀect, probably due to contributions of “after pulse
noise” typical for this type of PM tube. The total equivalent noise for FEU85
PM tubes with preampliﬁers was 6.5
1 MeV. The lowest equivalent noise,
3.6

±
1 MeV, was obtained with 9903B.

±

Signal distributions for 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 GeV/c positrons are shown in
Fig. 3. Only modules with signals above threshold
3 MeV were included to
the sum over nonet. We believe that low energy tails for the low momentum
(0.5 and 1.0 GeV/c) positrons are due to the interaction of the positrons with
matter upstream of the calorimeter modules.

∼

The experimental results for energy resolutions for the calorimeter prototype
with KURARAY Y11(200)-M-DC ﬁbers are shown in Table 3. Corrections to
energy resolution were obtained by subtracting the contributions of the beam
positron momentum spread and the eﬀects of energy loss upstream of the
calorimeter, studied with GEANT Monte-Carlo, from measured values.

4 Monte-Carlo simulation

Energy resolution of a Shashlyk module depends on variety of factors. We
include the following:

Sampling, i.e. thicknesses of lead and scintillator plates.
Longitudinal leakage i.e. ﬂuctuation of energy leakage due to the ﬁnite
length of module.
Transverse leakage i.e. ﬂuctuation of energy leakage due to the limited num-
ber of modules used to reconstruct an electromagnetic shower.
Eﬀect of the presence of holes, ﬁbers, and steel strips.
Light attenuation in the ﬁber.

4.1 GEANT simulation

GEANT 3.21 was used to simulate the development of electromagnetic showers
in the module. GEANT contains many tuning parameters which allows one
to select between speed and quality of simulation. Cuts on energy of electrons
(CUTELE) and photons (CUTGAM) are crucial for correct simulation of the
response of Shashlyk modules. Default values for both parameters are 1 MeV.
The dependence of the energy resolution on the choice of these cuts is displayed
in Fig. 5.

Simulated energy resolution is also strongly dependent details of simulating
energy loss. Default GEANT parameterization does not include generation of
delta-rays (DRAY=0) and uses Landau-Vavilov-Gauss ﬂuctuations (LOSS=2)
for energy loss. A signiﬁcantly diﬀerent result for energy resolution is obtained
(Fig. 6) if one enables delta-ray generation (DRAY=1) with appropriate mod-
iﬁcation to energy loss (LOSS=1).

olution on thickness of lead and scintillator plates, and number of layers, are
shown in Fig. 7. Calculations have been performed for 250 MeV photons. Un-
less otherwise noted on the histograms, the calorimeter is modeled to be very
long (6000 layers), consisting of 0.35 mm lead and 1.5 mm scintillator plates.

Sampling contribution to energy resolution may be estimated by the expression
σE/√E = 4.7%t−1/2s1/4, where t and s are thicknesses (mm) of lead and
scintillator plates, respectively. About 20 radiation lengths are required in
order to achieve a resolution better than 3%/qE(GeV), if only the mechanical
structure of module is taken into account.

The contribution to the energy resolution of holes in the calorimeter and
transverse leakage also has been estimated in the GEANT Monte-Carlo and
will be discussed below.

4.2 Light attenuation in ﬁbers

A main concern about attenuation length in ﬁbers is related to the longitudinal
ﬂuctuations of electromagnetic showers. The typical value for such ﬂuctuations

The attenuation length in KURARAY ﬁbers satisﬁes our requirements. This

4.3 Photostatistics

Light output was experimentally studied for several types of ﬁbers and pho-
tomultiplier tubes. The results are displayed in Fig. 9. The best result was
obtained for KURARAY ﬁber Y11(200)M-DC. The light output for a module
with this ﬁber was experimentally found to be 3100 photoelectrons per GeV.
This value is matched well by an estimation based on following assumptions:
(i) 7500 scintillation photons per MeV of deposited energy (for molding scintil-
lator used in prototype), (ii) 10% eﬃciency of light collection from scintillator

4.4 Simulation of light collection

Uniformity of light collection in the scintillator plates is another important
ingredient for obtaining good energy resolution.

14

To study the dependence of light collection on optical parameters of scintil-
lator plates, a special optical model was developed. Charged particles passing
through a scintillator plate generates a number of randomly directed photons
proportional to energy deposited. Photons so generated may be absorbed on,
reﬂect from, or penetrate through the surfaces of the plate. Three types of
outer surfaces are considered: (i) “clean”, i.e., the photon is specularly re-
ﬂected if the incident angle is appropriate for total internal reﬂection, other-
wise it exits from the scintillator, (ii) “mirror”, i.e., the photon is specularly
reﬂected independently of incident angle, and (iii) “paint”, i.e., the photon
is reﬂected diﬀusely. Photons leaving the scintillator may enter a ﬁber or be
reﬂected from environmental “paper” (diﬀusion reﬂection) or “mylar” (mir-
ror reﬂection). Photons entering a ﬁber may be reemitted or may exit the
ﬁber, depending on the actual length of the photon track in the ﬁber. The
model is customized by such parameters as refractive indices of scintillator
and ﬁber, attenuation length in scintillator, probability of photon reemitting
from a ﬁber, reﬂection eﬃciencies, and by geometry (size of the plate, hole
diameter, ﬁber diameter).

In spite of the simplicity of this model (e.g., it does not take into account
the dependence of reﬂection probability on incident angle and polarization
of photons) it gives a reasonable description of light collection in scintillator
and allows one to compare diﬀerent choices of the optics of scintillator plate.
Results of light collection simulation strongly depends on reﬂection eﬃciencies,
which are usually poorly known since they depend on the quality of surface
treatment. For this reason such a model should be used for relative predictions
rather than for absolute.

Model predictions, after tuning of all parameters, for the dependence of light
output on position of the light source, on the thickness of scintillator plate,
and on the ﬁber diameter are compared with experimental measurements in
Fig. 10-12.

The following parameters have been used for describing the light collection of
a prototype module: total internal reﬂection eﬃciency equals 93%, the large
surface of scintillator plate is covered by paper with a reﬂection eﬃciency of
70%, edges of the scintillator plates are mirrored with a reﬂection coeﬃcient
of 70%, absorption length in scintillator equals 100 cm, absorption length for
scintillator light in ﬁber is 0.5 mm, 5% of light is lost in each passing through
the boundary between scintillator and ﬁber. There is an air gap between ﬁbers
and scintillator. 140 photons per 1 MeV of deposited energy in scintillator were
generated to match the number of photoelectrons produced by 1 GeV positron
(if only losses due to the light collection and absorption in ﬁber are taken into
account).

5 Monte Carlo study of prototype module

To check the validity of our Monte-Carlo model, a GEANT simulation of the
test beam measurements of the prototype modules with 1 mm diameter KU-
RARAY Y11(200)-M-DC ﬁbers and 9903B was performed. Simulation was
carried out both for realistic beam, including positron momentum spread in
beamline and energy loss upstream calorimeter, and for ideal beam. Compar-
ison of simulation with experimental measurements is displayed in Table 4.
Experimental and Monte-Carlo with realistic beam results match each other
with an accuracy of a few percent. This gives us a conﬁdence that Monte-Carlo
simulation (with an ideal beam) properly reproduces the actual calorimeter
resolution.

To understand the contributions of diﬀerent eﬀects on the energy resolution
of the module, a Monte-Carlo simulation of the signals produced by 250 MeV
photons, has been performed. The resulting energy resolutions are displayed
in Table 5. Sampling eﬀects were simulated in a very long (6000 layers) mod-
ule. Additional eﬀects were consequently included. Statistical accuracy of the
calculation is 1.5%. Some disagreement between calculations and test beam
measurements may be related to the conditions of measurement (beam in

6 Improving the energy resolution

One can see that sampling adds the main contribution to energy resolution.
it is less than the combined contribution of other factors 3.3%
However,
(adding in quadrature). Among these contributions the most signiﬁcant are
photostatistics 2.1% and nonuniformity of light collection 1.8%. To reach the
proposed resolution of 3%/qE(GeV) sampling, photostatistics and uniformity
of light collection must be improved.

The possibilities of improving the sampling contribution are limited. Decreas-
ing the thickness of lead plates or increasing of thickness of scintillator plates
increases the eﬀective radiation length of the module, and as a result reso-
lution deteriorates due to longitudinal ﬂuctuations of electromagnetic shower
and due to an increased transverse leakage (increased Moli`ere radius). Si-
multaneously decreasing the thickness of lead and scintillator plates will lower
photostatistics. Decreasing lead and/or scintillator plates may also cause tech-
nical problems for module production.

To improve the uniformity of light collection we consider using a chemical
modiﬁcation of a scintillator surface (CMSS) [11] on the edges of the scintil-
lator plates, which produces thin (50-100 µm) white foam layer with a diﬀuse
reﬂection eﬃciency of about 93%. This coating also increase total light output
(photostatistics). Monte-Carlo distributions of light output as a function of
the distance from the center of modules with and without this coating are
shown in Fig. 13.

Alternatively, uniformity of light collection may be improved by the appropri-
ate varying of the density of ﬁber location in the scintillator plate.

In addition to increasing scintillator plate thickness and ﬁber diameter, light
output may be also increased by establishing optical contact between ﬁber
and scintillator. This may be accomplished by gluing ﬁbers within scintillator
holes. Direct measurements on a single plate (Fig. 11) conﬁrmed this concept.
The technology of producing this optical contact is not yet developed for a
total calorimeter, however, so calculations are made for both glue and air
contact between ﬁber and scintillator. The gain in photostatistics with glue is
expected to be about 2.

Within the limitations on sampling improvement we consider 3 possible ver-
sions of calorimeter. Results of calculations for the all versions of modules are
presented in Table 6.

One can see that improvements in mechanical and optical construction of
modules can yield energy resolution of about 3%/qE(GeV), and that modules

with thinner lead plates might give better results. There is almost no diﬀerence
between the expected resolution for version 1 and 3. A bigger longitudinal
leakage ﬂuctuations for version 3 are compensated by better sampling term.

Resolution is approximately 0.2%/qE(GeV) worse if the shower is measured
by 3
3 modules. Increasing of the number of modules to capture a larger
fraction of visible energy is limited by a greater noise contribution.

If ﬁbers are not glued, resolution will be additionally increased by 0.1%/qE(GeV)

7 Conclusion

Modules for a Shashlyk calorimeter with energy resolution about 4%/qE(GeV)
have been constructed and experimentally tested. Using these results as well
as results of special measurements, the detailed Monte-Carlo simulation of
the Shashlyk modules has been developed. Our model of the Shashlyk module
includes (i) the GEANT 3 simulation of an electromagnetic shower; (ii) the
optical model for the simulation of light collection in the scintillator plates;
(iii) eﬀects of light attenuation in the ﬁbers; (iv) eﬀects of quantum eﬃciency

This model gives an excellent description of the energy resolution for variety
of experimentally studied Shashlyk modules which is illustrated in Fig. 14.
A few measurements made with low energy photons [12] are also in perfect
agreement with the developed model.

Our Monte-Carlo simulation indicates the possibility of improving this resolu-
tion to about 3%/qE(GeV) for module with lead plate thickness 0.25 mm. In
a case with a realistic experimental environment, electronic noise and thresh-
olds, and limited number of modules in a clump, the realized resolution of
such a calorimeter is expected to be about (3.2

3.3)%/qE(GeV).

The experimental study of the test modules was performed in a 0.5
positron beam without precise measurement of the beam momentum. For this
reason extrapolation of the results of the measurements to the KOPIO energy

region (
ambiguity is a new test measurement in a low momentum electron beam (200

500 MeV/c) with a controlled spread in beam momentum or a measurement
with low energy photons [12].

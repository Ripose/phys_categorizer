Abstract
This paper is based on the outcome of the activity that has taken place during the recent workshop on “SuperB in Italy” held in Frascati
on November 11-12, 2005. The workshop was opened by a theoretical introduction of Marco Ciuchini and was structured in two working
groups. One focused on the machine and the other on the detector and experimental issues.∗

The present status on CP is mainly based on the results achieved by BABAR and Belle. Estabilishment of the indirect CP violation in B
sector in 2001 and of the direct CP violation in 2004 thanks to the success of PEP-II and KEKB e+e− asymmetric B Factories operating
at the center of mass energy corresponding to the mass of the Υ(4S ). With the two B Factories taking data, the Unitarity Triangle is now
beginning to be overconstrained by improving the measurements of the sides and now also of the angles α, and γ. We are also in presence
of the very intriguing results about the measurements of sin2β in the time dependent analysis of decay channels via penguin loops, where
b → sss and b → sdd. τ physics, in particular LFV search, as well as charm and ISR physics are important parts of the scientiﬁc program
of a SuperB Factory. The physics case together with possible scenarios for the high luminosity SuperB Factory based on the concepts of the
Linear Collider and the related experimental issues are discussed.

Overview and Physics
Introduction

1. PRESENT BABARAND BELLE PERFORMANCE

The two existing asymmetric B Factories, PEP-II and
KEKB, started their operations in 1999 and since then their
design peak luminosities have been exceeded: now PEP-II is
running with a peak luminosity of 10.5 × 1033 cm−2 s−1 and
KEKB with 15.8 × 1033 cm−2 s−1. These terriﬁc luminosities
have been obtained also thanks to the continuous beam injec-
tion that both laboratories have assumed as normal operation
mode.

Both machines achieved a tremendous increase in the inte-
grated luminosity soon after the beginning of the operations
in 1999 when both machines started to work in factory mode.
Their peak luminosities exceed soon 1033 cm−2 s−1 , and the
integrated luminosities of both B Factories doubled every 2
years as shown in ﬁgure (1). At present the total integrated
luminosity recorded by the two experiments (330 f b−1 of
BABAR and the 500 f b−1 of Belle) is not too far from one
billion of B ¯B pairs.

2. DETECTORS CHARACTERISTICS

Both BABAR and Belle detectors are conceptually similar,
they appear at ﬁrst glance as the typical hermetic apparata
designed for e+e− colliders, made of an inner Vertex De-
tector, a Tracking system, an Electromagnetic Calorimeter,
a Solenoidal Magnet and a Muon/Hadron system. Actually
they show a clear asymmetry that is a consequence of the
machine energy asymmetry. The distribution of the decay
products in the laboratory system is in fact peaked in the for-
ward direction, the direction of the high energy beam.

The more relevant diﬀerences of Belle with respect to
BABAR are in the Silicon Vertex Tracker (a lower number
of layers), in the Cherenkov system (Aerogel instead of the
imaging internal reﬂection quartz DIRC) and glass instead of
bakelite RPC for muon detection.

3. CKM CONSTRAINTS FROM NEW MEASUREMENTS
OF THE SIDES AND ANGLES

The measurement of sin2β became a program of precision
measurements in the general ﬁts of the CKM matrix in the
( ¯ρ, ¯η) plane already in 2004 [1]. More challenging were the
extractions of the other two angles of the unitarity triangle
γ and α. New values of |Vub| and |Vcb| [2], a new value of
sin2β from charmonium [3], the measurements of α [4] and
γ [5] have been presented last summer at LP05 and EPS05.
They are in fact becoming the most stringent constraints of
the Unitarity Triangle in the ( ¯ρ, ¯η) plane [6], as shown in the
ﬁgure (3). For this plot the information on cos 2β, ∆md, ∆ms
and the direct CP violation in the kaon sector ǫK are also
used. We also show the impact of the measurements of the
angles from the B factories in the right plot of ﬁgure (3). The
agreement between this bounds and the global area coming
from sides measurements is an important test of the consis-
tency of the CKM mechanism in describing non-leptonic B
decays and CP asymmetries. Present data suggest a (not yet
signiﬁcative) discrepancy, which calls for more data to be
clariﬁed in details.

Making the hypothesis that NP enters observables in the
ﬂavour sector only at the loop level, it is possible to de-
termine the ¯ρ − ¯η plane independently of NP contributions
(see Figure 4), using tree-level B decays : Vub and Vcb using
semileptonic inclusive and exclusive B decays and the angle
γ measuring the phase of Vub appearing in the interference
between b → c and b → u transitions to DK ﬁnal states.

The abundance of information allows to generalize the UT
ﬁt beyond the Standard Model, parameterizing in a general
way the eﬀect of New Physics (NP) through a multiplicative
factor to the amplitude (CBd) and an additional weak phase
(φBd) in the B– ¯B mixing process [7]. As the left plot of ﬁg-
ure (4) shows, even in this case the present measurements
give a good constrain on ¯ρ and ¯η, strongly suppressing the
possibility of large NP enhancements in this sector (the ﬁt
gives a fraction of 7% probability for the NP solution with
negative ¯η, respect to the 93% of the “Standard Model like”
solution) [8]. This means that a huge increase in luminosity
is needed, in order to discrimate NP scenarios from a simple
Standard Model ﬁt. This is more evident on the right plot of
ﬁgure (4), where the present bound on the φBd vs. CBd plane
is shown. In this case, in fact, the level of precision is not
good enough to obtain any exclusion of the Standard Model
scenario (CBd = 1 and φBd = 0).

In Summer 2004, the ﬁrst observation of the asymmetry

ACP =

N( ¯B0 → K−π+) − N(B0 → K+π−)
N( ¯B0 → K−π+) + N(B0 → K+π−)

gave the evidence of direct CP violation in the B sector.

BABAR found an asymmetry value of

ACP = −0.133 ± 0.030S tat ± 0.009S yst.

The value, after the average of BABAR, Belle, and CDF re-
sults, is [9]

ACP = −0.114 ± 0.020.

Starting in 2005 we have moved from the CP Violation
discovery era (given by the asymmetries from time depen-
dent and time integrated analyses as in the case of the direct
CP violation in B0 → K+π− , or in B+ analysis for the ex-
traction of γ), to a new era of precision measurements and
constraints on the Unitarity Triangle.

4. MEASUREMENTS OF
MEDIATED DECAYS

sin2β

VIA

PENGUIN-

An interesting ﬁeld under study is the time-dependent
analysis of those decay channels that can only proceed
through ”penguin” diagrams, such as the b → (s ¯ss) pro-
cesses:

• B0 → φK0

• B0 → (KK)CPK0

and the similar (b → (d ¯ds)) transitions:

3

These decays take the dominant contribution from the
combination of CKM elements VtbV ∗
ts and have the same
phase of the charmonium channels b → (c¯cs), up to a small
phase shift of Vts respect to Vcb.
If, however, new heavy
quanta contribute to the loops (as shown in ﬁgure (5) in the
case of SUSY), new phases can contribute to the asymmetry
and the S coeﬃcient of the time dependent analysis could be
substantially diﬀerent from sin2β [10]. The comparison be-
tween results from all the above B0 decay channels [11] and
sin2β from charmonium, as shown in the HFAG plot (see

FIG. 2: BABAR and Belle detectors

FIG. 3: ¯ρ, ¯η plane using all the available constraints (left) and only the information from the UT angles (right).

Figure 6), must be interpreted anyway ”cum grano salis”.
There are in fact other contributions to be taken into account
in addition to the diagrams with top quark insertion in the
loop.

For example, even in the case the theoretically cleanest
channels (B0 → φK0 and B0 → K0
S ), one has to take
into account a Standard Model uncertainty due to a penguin
contribution with an up quark running in the loop. Using the
CKM couplings to scale this term to the leading contribu-
tion, we obtain a correction of the order of λ2 ≈ 5% com-
ing from the fact that these contributions are doubly Cabibbo

S K0

S K0

suppressed. For the other decay channels the uncertainty
could be as large as 10% (or even more), since in that case
the doubly Cabibbo suppressed terms also include tree-level
transitions. [12]

Once these contributions are taken into account, one can
use the experimental results for the S parameters to obtain
a bound on NP parameters [13]. For example, one can use
the knowledge of b → sγ and b → sll Branching Ratios
in SUSY models to bound the values of NP parameters and
study their eﬀect on the b → s penguin modes [14]. This
is done in ﬁgure (7), where the case of a RL mass insertion

order to make this comparison really possible, the statistical
error should be reduced below the theoretical uncertainties.
To do that, a statistics between 20 and 50 times higher than
present (i.e. 15 to 40 ab−1) is needed. In few years, with LHC

the precise measurement of channels mediated by loop di-
agrams, both in b → s and b → d transitions, will allow
to determine the couplings for New Physics contributions,
such as the mass insertion parameters δ23 and δ13 in SUSY
scenarios. For instance, a mass insertion δ23 with an imagi-
nary part of ∼ 2%, with an average squark mass in the range

∼ 350 − 450 GeV can produce a deviation of S (φK0
S ) of the
order of 20% respect to S (J/ψ K0
S ), as shown in the
right plot of ﬁgure (7). In order to establish such 20% diﬀer-
ence at the 5σ level, i.e. measuring ACP(φK0
S ) = 0.60 ± 0.03,
and assuming the current per event sensitivity, we need to
integrate a statistics corresponding to 30 ab−1.

S − φK0

Similar constraints on New Physics can be obtained study-
ing similar channels. For instance, the radiative penguin de-
cays b → sγ provide a particularly clean environment. Di-
rect CP violation in these decays is expected to be ≈ 0.5% in
the Standard Model, but could be enhanced by New Physics
contributions to the penguin loop. Recent inclusive and ex-
clusive measurements are just beginning to constrain such
contributions. The information they provide at this point ex-
clude the possibility of huge variations respect to the Stan-
dard Model expectations. On the other side, because of the
limited statistics, the possibility of observing an enhance-
ment of an order of magnitude is still open, but only a Su-
perB factory can provide the needed statistics. It is also im-
portant to stress the fact that CP measurements are statis-
tics limited, and will continue to be so until at least 10 ab−1.
With larger samples it would be interesting to measure the
direct CP asymmetry in b → dγ decays where the Stan-
dard Model prediction is -12%. BABAR has also shown
that it is feasible to measure time-dependent CP violation
in B0 → K∗0(→ K0
S π0)γ. In the Standard Model the sine
term of the time dependent CP asymmetry in this channel
is suppressed respect to sin 2β, being proportional to a fac-
tor related to the helicity suppression of left-handed respect
to right-handed photons. This measurement, which is sensi-
tive to New Physics couplings with the opposite helicity, will
continue to be statistics limited up to 50 ab−1. An alternative
method of studying the photon polarization in b → sγ is the
Dalitz plot distribution of the Kππ system in B0 → Kππγ,
but this also requires a large statistics sample.

4.1. Rare Decay Branching Fractions

Many rare B decay modes can potentially give access to
physics beyond the Standard Model via measurements other
than of CP-violating asymmetries. Some examples of these
modes are listed in Table III. Typically, these decays do not
occur at tree level and consequently the rates are strongly
suppressed in the Standard Model. Substantial enhance-
ments in the rates and/or variations in angular distributions
of ﬁnal state particles could result from the presence of new
heavy particles in loop diagrams, resulting in clear evidence
of New Physics. Moreover, because the pattern of observ-
able eﬀects in highly model-dependent, measurements of
several rare decay modes can provide information regarding
the source of the New Physics.

The ratio of b → dγ to b → sγ decays is directly related to
the ratio Vtd/Vts. It is interesting to measure this ratio in pen-
guin processes as well as through Bd/Bs mixing, since New
Physics enters in diﬀerent ways. The ratio of the exclusive
decays B → ργ and B → K∗γ can be accurately measured,
but the precision of the determination of Vtd/Vts is limited
by theoretical uncertainties of ≈ 12% in the ratio of the form
factors. A measurement of the ratio of the inclusive decays
does not suﬀer from this uncertainty, but is experimentally
rather challenging, and requires a large data sample.

Searches for B → sν¯ν, either inclusively or exclusively,

7

are extremely diﬃcult, due to the presence of the two ﬁnal
state neutrinos. The required sensitivity can, however, be
obtained using the recoil method, in which the signal mode
(in this case the exclusive B → Kν¯ν and K∗ν¯ν modes) is
sought in the recoil against a fully reconstructed hadronic B
decay. Assuming Standard Model branching fractions, ex-
trapolation of current analyses suggest that we would expect
a signal of 10 events in each of the four modes (K−,0, K∗−,0)
although with a substantial background, with 3 ab−1 of data.
A statistically signiﬁcant signal would emerge in the com-
bination of modes with approximately 10 ab−1 even using a
simple cut-and-count analysis.

The decays Bd → ℓℓ (ℓ = e, µ, τ) are somewhat less
promising in the sense that it appears impossible to reach
the predicted Standard Model branching fractions even with
more than 50 ab−1 of data. Moreover, Bd → µµ is expected
to be accessible at both LHCb and BTeV, and these exper-
iments will also be able to access Bs → µµ, which is ex-
pected to provide a more stringent test of New Physics. How-
ever, even 10 ab−1 of data will improve the existing limits on
these modes by an order of magnitude, and an e+e− B Fac-
tory does have the advantage of also being able to search
for Bd → e+e− and the (extremely challenging) Bd → τ+τ−
mode.

4.2.

sℓ+ℓ−, Kℓ+ℓ−, K∗ℓ+ℓ− Decays

The exclusive K(∗)ℓ+ℓ− and inclusive sℓ+ℓ− decays have
been intensively studied theoretically, as they provide a po-
tentially unique window on New Physics. For example, in
the Standard Model, the forward/backward asymmetry AFB
of the lepton pair has a zero at lepton pair mass ˆs0 = 0.14
GeV. In extensions of the Standard Model, this zero may
be approached from the opposite direction, or may be al-
together absent. This region of lepton pair invariant mass
represents only a small fraction of the allowed kinematic re-
gion of these rare decays, so a large data sample is required
to make this measurement. The measurement of AFB can
be done at hadronic experiments, but only in the exclusive
modes involving muons. Theoretical predictions are typi-
cally more precise for inclusive processes, which can only
be measured at a Super B Factory. It is very important to
compare AFB in muon and electron modes, as this asymmetry
can be changed by the presence of a charged Higgs. Table IV
summarizes the achievable measurement precision.

5. EXTRAPOLATION TO 50ab−1

The current experimental facilities are supposed to inte-
grate a combined luminosity of ∼ 2ab−1, which will improve
the present knowledge of SM related quantities and will al-
low more stringent bounds on New Physics (NP) parameters.
Never the less, the precision will not be enough to signiﬁca-
tively determine the values of such parameters, even in the
optimistic scenario of an early discovery of NP at LHC. A

more reasonable value for the statistics needed is ∼ 50ab−1,
which can be achieved in with a data taking of the order of
one year at the facility proposed in this document. With such
a precision, the UT analysis will became a high precision
test, as shown in ﬁg. 8.

The plot represents the Universal Unitarity Triangle anal-
ysis [16], which is a UT ﬁt performed using only quantities
that are independent of NP contributions within MFV mod-
els. 2 This is a common starting point of the SM analysis, as
well as of any study of MFV scenarios [18]. Even if this ﬁt
is obtained from the standard analysis removing those quan-
tities that are sensitive to NP (which provides a bound on
NP parameters once the UUT is given as input), we will be
able to achieve a precision of the order of percent on ¯ρ and
¯η. This MFV generalized analysis will be precise enough to
overcome the present SM ﬁt, shown in ﬁgure (3).

At the same time, the improvement of the measurements
of b → s processes will allow to strongly bound the values of
the mass insertions parameters of ﬁgure (7), as shown in ﬁg-
ure (9). Here, we assumed the pessimistic scenario in which
the two experimental inputs (BR(b → sγ) and BR(b → sll))
will be in perfect agreement with the SM. The experimental
precision, in this case, will be enough to test NP eﬀects at the

dently of NP. On the other side, after the UUT analysis is performed,
these two bounds provide constraints on the scale of NP particles [8, 17].

percentage level. AT the contrary, there will be enough sen-
sibility to translate any future experimental discrepancy into
useful information for the interplay between ﬂavour physics
and the direct search of NP at the hadron colliders.

Another important aspect to stress is the strong connection
of B and τ physics, in the framework of testing GUT mod-
els. An example of this is provided in ﬁgure (10), where the
impact of the Upper Limit on BR(τ → µγ) is shown on the
same plot of ﬁgure (7), once b → s and τ → µ decays are
connected in the framework of GUT. [19] In general, with
the high luminosity that a SuperB factory can collect, rare
decays of τ leptons can be studied with high precision, pro-
viding a stringent test of ﬂavour violation in the leptonic sec-
tor and boosting our capability of testing GUT models.

Part II
Detector Working Group Report

The BABAR and Belle detectors have proven to be very ef-
fective instruments to explore precision ﬂavor physics. The
detector working group considers that their basic design re-
mains valid at SuperB, provided some subsystems can be
modiﬁed as discussed in the following.

The SuperB linear collider design employs low-current
beams crossing at a frequency in the MHz range with a very
small beam spot size, resulting in a relatively low machine

background rate. In addition, machine design and cost argu-
ment require a reduction in the energy asymmetry changing
the boost from the current βγ = 0.56 of BABAR and 0.45 of
Belle down to 0.2 − 0.3.

Under these conditions, in particular the low background
rate, many of the BABAR or Belle subsystems would be di-
rectly reusable at SuperB, or would require some design op-
timization within the same technology choice, mainly driven
by the beam crossing time structure.

On the other hand the smaller boost, reducing the separa-
tion between the two B decay vertices, requires an improved
vertexing resolution to maintain the physics reach. This im-
provement is possible thanks to the small beam dimensions
that allow a reduction of the beam pipe radius to 1.0 cm or

less, but will require signiﬁcant R&D on the detector tech-
nology needed to instrument the small radius tracking region.
Particle identiﬁcation will also require R&D to improve the
compactness of the light detection system and extend angu-
lar coverage. Some amount of R&D will also be required to
optimize crystals for small angle calorimetry, where the high
Bhabha rate will increase occupancy beyond the capabilities
of current CsI(Tl) systems.

In the following we discuss how machine parameters such
as boost and energy spread aﬀect the detector design and
physics reach (Sec. 6), what machine and bacgkrounds are
expected (Sec. 7), and the main issues for the detector sub-
systems (Sec. 8 – 12)

6. PHYSICS DEPENDANCE ON BASIC PARAMETERS
ASSUMPTIONS

There are several parameters of the SuperB Factory which
directly impact the physics capabilities at the new accelera-
tor. These include: the energy asymmetry or βγ, the center-
of-mass energy spread, the beam size and beam-pipe size at
the interaction point, and the probability of multiple interac-
tions in a single crossing (or train of crossings).

The study of time-dependent CP violation requires that the
B0 − B0 system be boosted in the lab system, so that the B-
meson decay vertices are separated by a measurable amount.
The current B Factories have boosts of βγ = 0.56 (PEP-II)
and 0.45 (KEKB). Lower boosts are feasible with improved
vertex resolution, as described below.

The Υ(4S ) has a FWHM of roughly 18 MeV, so that
the accelerator’s beam energy spread will reduce the eﬀec-
tive cross-section to BB. A center-of-mass energy spread of
5 MeV (10 MeV) corresponds to a reduction of roughly 0.85
(0.67). Exclusive reconstruction of B-meson decays usually
rely on two kinematic variables to separate the signal from
continuum (qq) or random combinatoric backgrounds. Typi-
cally these kinematic variables are mES = q(EBeam/2)2 − p2
B
and ∆E = EB−EBeam/2, where all quantities are in the center-
of-mass. The width of the mES distribution is determined al-

most exclusively by the accelerator’s center-of-mass energy
spread, and a larger energy spread reduces the background
separation achievable with this kinematic variable. Broaden-
ing of the mES distribution is ultimately limited by the width
of the Υ(4S ), since the energy spread convoluted with the
Υ(4S ) line-shape is the relevant distribution. The mES width
saturates at roughly 5.5 MeV, or a factor of two wider than
PEP-II.

The much smaller beam-spots at the SuperB machine will
permit smaller beam-pipes, allowing the ﬁrst active layer of
a Silicon Vertex detector to be closer to the interaction point.
Such improvements will be necessary to reduce the energy
asymmetry, while maintaining the ratio of B vertex separa-
tion over vertex resolution at or above 2.5. In addition, such
improved vertexing may allow improved ﬂavor tagging and
background rejection. For example, it may be possible to
identify the charm vertex in semi-leptonic decays, to better
separate leptons from B as opposed to charm decays.

Lastly, the time structure at the SuperB machine will be
diﬀerent from that at the current B factories. The bunch
collision frequency will be of order 1 MHz, compared to
238 MHz at PEP-II. At this frequency, for a luminosity of
L = 1036, the roughly 100 nb cross-section, for all processes,
corresponds to an interaction in every tenth crossing. This
implies that in about 10% of all BB events there will also
be a Bhabha or two-photon interaction, and roughly 1% of

10

the time there will be a second qq or BB event as well. This
physics pile-up will produce additional background for rare
processes, but can be removed with global event energy re-
quirements.

present PEP-II and KEK-B machines, as well as experience
from SLC and studies for backgrounds at the ILC, allow us
to extrapolate the background sources which are important
for consideration at present:

7. MACHINE BACKGROUNDS

The reduction in beam currents in a linear-colliding B-
Factory design, as compared with a standard storage ring
conﬁguration, results in a dramatic reduction in single-beam
background (which would otherwise be the dominant back-
ground source). The single-beam background sources, for
example beam-gas, should be negligible compared with the
luminosity-scaling sources detailed below. A precise back-
ground prediction is not possible at this stage given the pre-
liminary nature of the machine design. However, the detailed
characterization of the various background sources on the

Luminosity Sources The most dangerous background
In this case, the
source is radiative Bhabha debris.
background rate is strictly proportional
to lumi-
nosity and therefore will be 100 times higher at a
Super B Factory than today. To control this source,
magnetic bending elements should be kept as far
as is practical from the interaction point in order to
prevent oﬀ-momentum electrons or positrons from
reaching apertures close to the detector. At PEP-II,
the presence of a strong dipole ﬁeld only 20 cm away
from the IP, required to separate the two beams in
the absence of a crossing angle, accounts for the
fact that this background is quite prominent while
being small or negligible at KEK-B. At SuperB, the

11

ﬁrst magnetic elements will be focusing quadrupoles
located approximately 40 cm away from the IP.
Due to the lack of nearby dipoles, the “luminosity”
background should be substantially reduced from
a simple extrapolation from PEP-II, but potentially
larger than indicated by the KEK-B extrapolation. We
have assumed, as a baseline, a factor 5 reduction with
respect to the PEP-II extrapolation, but subdetectors
have considered the full range between 0.2 and 1
times the PEP-II-based extrapolation as a measure of
the uncertainty in the estimates.

Beam-beam interactions. Beam-beam interactions, i.e., the
transverse blowup of one beam due to its interaction
with the other, will be one major source of particle
loss rate. Backgrounds will be produced by beam
tails which are created by this mechanism and then hit
nearby apertures. Quantitative prediction of these tails
is almost impossible, especially when the machine is
operated close to its limits where they tend to get very
large. The best means to control the contribution is
to design an advanced collimator scheme that can pre-
vent beam tails from hitting apertures near the detec-
tor. The detector must also be well protected against
the secondaries produced at the collimators. The maxi-
mum amount of collimation will be determined by the
lifetime loss observed when closing the collimators.
It is therefore prudent to integrate the collimator de-
sign as early as possible into the machine design to
have control of this background source. The observed
PEP-II beam-beam terms have been roughly parame-
terized and extrapolated, leading to a conclusion that
this source will make a negligible contribution. How-
ever, it will require a very substantial eﬀort to realize
such performance at SuperB.

Touschek background. Touschek background, i.e., longitu-
dinal beam blowup due to intrabunch scattering, will
be present and is proportional to the bunch density. It
will therefore be signiﬁcantly increased with respect
to the present PEP-II value. This eﬀect accounts for a
signiﬁcant part of the Belle background (around 20%)
but is barely visible in PEP-II. Its eﬀect on the detector
will again be a very sensitive function of the magnetic
elements in that area. This background can be mod-
eled in principle rather well and a good extrapolation
should be available in the coming months.

Synchrotron radiation. As noted above, we expect

the
single-beam sources of synchrotron radiation to be

amount of beam-beam synchtrotron radiation (“beam-
strahlung”) should be greater than either the present
B-Factories or in a super-B conﬁguration using a stan-
dard storage ring; however it should be small com-
pared with, for example, the ILC, or even the SLC,
due to the much lower beam energies. A 5 µm gold
masking similar to that presently within the PEP-II

beampipe should be suﬃcient to remove this contri-
bution (and may perhaps be able to be made even thin-
ner).

All subdetectors are required to satisfy a factor of ﬁve
safety margin to take into account for these extra terms. A
large safety margin is also needed to cope with background
ﬂuctuations.

To guarantee high operational eﬃciency, it is essential that
the detector can stand short background bursts, of magnitude
comparable with the steady level. Such bursts, typically last-
ing a few seconds, are seen very frequently (up to 1 per hour
at KEK-B) and are attributed to dust particles attracted from
the beam pipe to the center of the beam. This implies detec-
tors with large safety margins in terms of integrated dose and
radiation bursts.

Finally, proper instrumentation must be integrated from
the start into the detector and machine designs, in order to
measure the background, isolate its various sources and mon-
itor its evolution in a continuous fashion.

In conclusion, although backgrounds are expected to be
signiﬁcantly smaller at a linearly-colliding B-Factory than in
a conﬁguration using a standard storage ring, they are still
of crucial import in the design of the detector and interac-
tion region to minimize the sources of backgrounds that are
not reduced by a reduction in single beam currents. In par-
ticular, the design of the IR to minimize radiative-Bhabha
background, and the ability of detector elements to withstand
short background bursts, are both of critical importance.

8. VERTEXING

The SuperB interaction region design is characterized by
the small size of the transversal section of the beams, fraction
of µm for σx and tens of nm for σy. Therefore it will be pos-
sible to reduce the radial dimension of the beam-pipe tube
up to 5 − 10 mm radius, still preventing the beams to scat-
ter into the tube within the detector coverage angle. The Be
thickness of the tube will be reduced down to 200 − 300 µm,
corresponding to (5.6 − 8.5) · 10−4X0, depending on the value
of the radius of the beam pipe. Another feature of the inno-
vative SuperB design is the low current circulating inside the
beam-pipe, tens of mA, in spite of the high luminosity. The
cooling system for the beam-pipe will be not necessary and
it has been removed in the design. The reduced amount of
radial material and the possibility to measure the ﬁrst hit of
the track very close to the production vertex will beneﬁt the
track parameters determination.

First Monte Carlo studies indicate precise determination
of the B decay vertices at the level of 10 − 20 µm and con-
sequently on the ∆z separation along the beam axis among
the two B mesons, basic ingredients for the time dependent
analysises.

The multiple scattering contribution to the resolution on
the decay vertex is no more dominating since the amount
of radial material is very much reduced with respect to the
B-factory scenario. The intrinsic spatial resolution ﬁxed

12

by the pitch width of the silicon vertex detector will add a
non-negligible contribution on the vertex measurements and
therefore it will be important to minimize it as much as pos-
sible in a future vertex detector.

For the simulation study we added a 50 µm Monolithic
Active Pixel silicon layer, in addition to the current BABAR
silicon vertex detector, mounted on a 50 µm kapton foil and
glued directly on the beam-pipe. This conﬁguration allows
to measure the ﬁrst hit of the track just outside the beam-
pipe.
In ﬁgure 11it is shown the resolution on the proper
time diﬀerence of the two B (∆t) for three diﬀerent beam-
pipe conﬁgurations:

• 0.5 cm radius: consider this as the aggressive scenario
where we can evaluate the very limit of the vertex reso-
lution we can think to achieve. We considered 200 µm
Be thickness for the beam-pipe and 5 µm spatial reso-
lution on hits from charged tracks.

• 1.0 cm radius: most likely scenario with 300 µm Be
thickness for the beam-pipe and 10 µm spatial resolu-
tion on hits from charged tracks.

• 1.5 cm radius: conservative scenario with 500 µm Be
thickness and 10 µm spatial resolution on hits from
charged tracks.

In all the conﬁguration we have considered a 5 − µm-thick
gold foil (equivalent to 150 µm of silicon) before the ﬁrst
layer of the vertex detector in order to absorb low energy
background photons.

The spectacular precision of the decay vertex determina-
tion will also beneﬁt several aspects of the B meson recon-
struction. The possibility to reduce the energy asymmetry
without aﬀecting the proper time resolution will enlarge the
acceptance of the detector improving the reconstruction of
decay modes with neutrinos (B → τν, B → D(∗)τν, τ decays,
etc.). The ability to separate the B from the D vertex would
help rejecting the q ¯q events (q = u, d, s, c quarks) and would
open new analyses techniques for B ﬂavor tagging based on
topological algorithms. This possibility has still to be quan-
titatively estimated.

application. In these devices the active detection thickness
is only of the order of 10-20 µm, and they can therefore
be thinned down to 50 µm, thus signiﬁcantly recucing the
amount of material in the ﬁrst detection layer.

The current silicon strip detector systems have four or ﬁve
layers, strip lengths between 5 and 20 cm, strip pitch be-
tween 50 and 200 µm, and are readout through preampliﬁers
with shaping times between 100 and 400 ns. Given the time
structure of events at SuperB and the projected low back-
grounds, it should be possible to increase the shaping time
of the preampliﬁers to 0.5-1 µs, thus improving the signal
to noise ratio and making it possible to reduce the detector
thickness from the current 300 µm to 200 µm.

If the amount of material is reduced, decreasing the intrin-
sic resolution from the current 12-20 µm to 5-10 µm through
a ﬁner pitch readout would both beneﬁt the momentum reso-
lution, especially for high momentum particles, and improve
the angle measurement, which is crucial for vertexing as well
as for particle identiﬁcation based on ˇCerenkov angle deter-
mination. The small angle region will require special atten-
tion because of the high rate Bhabha scattering. Depending
on the speciﬁc choice of boost and angular coverage a spe-
cial section of silicon strips with ﬁner segmentation and/or
shorter shaping time will be required. This section could be
organized in forward and backward disks or cones electri-
cally separated from the central part of the detector.

The BABARand Belle drift chambers are conceptually sim-
ilar but have diﬀerent dimensions: from 23.6 to 80.9 cm for
BABAR; from 16 to 114 cm for Belle. They use He-based gas
mixtures, with cell sizes from 12 to 18mm. Maximum drift
time is around 500 ns and the resolution about 100 µm in the
best part of the cell. In preparation for luminosity upgrades,
Belle has experimented with small cell (5.4 mm) drift cham-
ber for the inner layers of the CDC ﬁnding a signiﬁcant rate
reduction but a deteriorated resolution (150 µm).

We expect that the reduction in cell size will not be needed
at SuperB. On the contrary one could take advantage of the
time structure of the events and increase the drift time to up
to 1 µs with the intent of improving the resolution. A full op-
timization of the drift chamber design will only be possible
when detailed background simulations are available.

9. TRACKING

Charged particle tracking is performed at BABARand Belle
through a combination of silicon strip detectors and drift
chamber. This design allows a high resolution determina-
tion of the track parameters near the interaction point while
retaining good momentum resolution in the gaseous drift
chamber. Occupancies in the two systems are acceptable
with background currently experienced at the two B Fac-
tories and we expect that a similar detector design will be
usable at SuperB.

A small radius vertexing device, directly mounted on the
beam pipe, will be required to improve vertex resolution.
Monolithic active pixel systems are being developed by sev-
eral groups and are a very promising technology for this

10. PARTICLE IDENTIFICATION

Particle identiﬁcation is a central aspect of the criteria de-
scribing the desired properties of a detector working at Su-
perB. Such a detector system generally requires good track-
ing information to help optimize the PID function, good start
time information and generally needs supplementary infor-
mation, (such as dE/dx from the energy loss from the track-
ing chambers), to cover the full desired momentum range.

The BABARand Belle detectors incorporate relatively com-
plete PID systems, which essentially provide the needed
performance for their respective environments. The BABAR
DIRC system has been particularly robust, relatively insen-
sitive to background, covers most of the momentum range

for all particle species, and has extremely good misidenti-
ﬁcation properties. A new PID system based on the DIRC
technique but using modern photon detectors, such as a Fast
Focusing DIRC or a TOP, would provide more complete ge-
ometrical and momentum coverage, and perhaps better re-
jection at the highest momenta. The ﬁnal choice of collision
energies at the SuperB Factory will deﬁne the highest en-
ergy/momentum needed for pion/kaon separation. It is also
probable that the End Cap regions will require more attention
than has been given for the current detectors.

The environment at the proposed SuperB Factory should
not be a problem for the PID systems described above. The
beam currents are down a lot, and the backgrounds should
be much less severe than presently experienced, although
this will depend, in detail, on the design and implementation
of the ﬁnal focus system The data acquisition problem will
be interesting, but quite manageable, requiring a pipelined
approach, but similar to the solution for other systems, and
achievable with commodity equipment.

More generally, the technologies of choice for PID in a
new super B factory detector appear to be two variations of
the ˇCerenkov focusing device, either in two or in three di-
mensions the DIRC of BaBar, a fast DIRC, or the TOP of
Belle; and two systems that have special interest for the end
cap regions an aerogel proximity focusing device, and pos-

sibly conventional time of ﬂight with really good timing, (of
order 30 picoseconds) providing there is adequate momen-
tum resolution from the forward tracking devices.

Any new technology proposed to replace the established
PID systems will require a thorough and aggressive R&D
activity, proving not only the device particle identiﬁcation
performance in real life conditions, but also to demonstrate
the photon detector lifetimes, robustness and reliability, un-
der realistic conditions.

The SLAC group is in the middle of beam test of the Fast
Focusing Dirc idea, with encouraging results. We are also in
the middle of testing the micro-channel plate single photon
detectors in magnetic ﬁelds up to 15 KGauss, with encour-
aging results.

11. CALORIMETRY

Although detailed background calculations for SuperB
have not yet been done, the existing CsI(Tl) electromagnetic
calorimeters of BABAR and Belle should be suitable for use
at the SuperB MegaHertz collision rate, at least for the main
barrel sections. The long (1.3 µs) decay time of CsI(Tl)
should not be a severe problem. The radiation dose rate
should be an order of magnitude smaller than at the current

14

B factories. The barrel calorimeters of either current detector
should therefore be adequate without modiﬁcation.

There may, however, be reason to consider upgrading the
endcap calorimeters.
It is likely that the smaller size of
beamline elements inside the detector will allow extension of
the solid angle coverage for tracking and calorimetry. This
would be beneﬁcial to all rare decay physics involving miss-
ing energy, including such important topics as as measure-
ment of B → τν or B → Kν¯ν branching fractions.

The cross section for Bhabha scattering events at 100 mrad
in the endcap region is more than an order of magnitude
greater that it is at 300 mrad; at small polar angles there will
thus be a signiﬁcant number of events in which a Bhabha
electron overlaps a hadronic event. The most eﬀective way to
combat this is to use a photon detection medium with faster
response and shorter Molière radius, to minimize the proba-
bility of temporal or spatial overlaps. Development work on
suitable crystals, cerium-doped lutetium orthosilicate (LSO)
and lutetium yttrium orthosilicate (LYSO), which have a
Molère radius 60% of that of CsI, is underway at Caltech.
The two crystals are very similar, with LYSO somewhat eas-
ier to grow and thus somewhat less expensive. LSO/LYSO
is also mechanically strong, and is not hygroscopic. A com-
parison of the properties of CsI(Tl) and LSO/LYSO(Ce) is
shown in Table V.

A replacement of the existing endcaps in Belle or replace-
ment of the existing forward endcap in BABAR and the ad-
dition of a rear endcap is thus likely to be a worthwhile up-
grade. This would allow extension of the solid angle cov-
erage to the 100 mrad regime, and minimize the number of
events with overlapping Bhabhas. The BABAR forward end-
cap calorimeter covers the solid angle down to 350 mrad;
there is no backward endcap. The forward calorimeter of
Belle covers the region down to 200 mrad, while the back-
ward endcap calorimeter extends to 400 mrad.

The spectrum of scintillation light in LSO(Ce) peaks at
420 nm, has a total light output 65% of that of CsI(Tl), a
very fast decay time of 42 ns and is extremely radiation hard.
The spectrum is well-matched to solid state readout by an
avalanche photodiode (APD) or a conventional photodiode.
A 137Cs spectrum using a full-size LSO bar and a single
Hamamatsu APD, as well as comparison to a photomultiplier
tube, is shown in Figure 12.

A certain amount of additional R&D is necessary to bring
LSO/LYSO(Ce) to a state in which one could build an actual
calorimeter. This R&D involves optimization of the unifor-
mity of the cerium dopant, analysis and removal of trace im-
purities from the basic salt, which are the source of a small
amount of phosphorescence observed under intense radiation
doses, and further optimization of the APD readout. There
is already enough crystal growth capacity to produce the
endcap crystals in a few months. Working with the crystal
growers, we expect to be able to resolve the remaining large
crystal-related issues and to bring the price into a more af-
fordable range. These tasks could all be accomplished within
a year or two; an LSO(Ce) upgrade of the endcap regions of
either BABAR or Belle could thus be accomplished on the de-

sired time scale.

12. MUON DETECTOR

The muon detection system at current B Factories is real-
ized by instrumenting the ﬂux return yoke of the magnets
with large area tracking detectors made of resistive plate
chambers or limited streamer tubes. These technologies have
limited rate capabilities, but with the current understanding
of machine backgrounds it will be possible to use these de-
tectors at SuperB. Special care must be taken to shield the
outermost layers of the muon detection systems from radi-
ation coming from the tunnel. This could be generated for
instance by synchrotron radiation backsplashing on far-away
masking elements. In addition, depending on the choices on
the boost and on the minimum angular coverage, the small
angle portion of the detector will probably require increased
segmentation of the readout and/or separate gas volumes.
There seem to be no signiﬁcant technological problem in de-
signing the muon detection system at SuperB.

13. TRIGGER-DAQ

The trigger and DAQ system for the detector at the Su-
perB Factory will have the task of handling the large event
and data rates produced at a luminosity of L = 1036. The
type of trigger needed depends critically on the bunch colli-
sion frequency. At frequencies at or below 1 MHz an online
trigger would only provide a factor of 10 or less in rejection,
and at this level all event rejection could be implemented
instead in software triggers. At frequencies above 1 MHz a
hardware trigger would be desirable to reduce the event read-
out rate to the 100 kHz level. For any conﬁguration, highly
pipelined readout in the DAQ system will be necessary. Any
detector operating at L = 1036 will have DAQ rates of the or-
der of 5 GBytes/sec. This high rate is, however, roughly an
order of magnitude smaller than the front-end read-out rates
of the LHC experiments. Extrapolations, including Moore’s
law scaling for networks, disks, and CPUs, indicate that the
trigger and DAQ at SuperB will be comparable in diﬃculty
to the current BABAR system.

Initial Parameters for a Linear
Super-B-Factory

A Super B Factory, an asymmetric energy e+e− collider with
a luminosity of order 1036 cm−2s−1, can provide a sensi-
tive probe of new physics in the ﬂavor sector of the Stan-
dard Model. The success of the PEP-II and KEKB asym-
metric colliders [20, 21] in producing unprecedented lumi-
nosity above 1034 cm−2s−1has taught us about the acceler-

ator physics of asymmetric e+e− colliders in a new param-
eter regime. Furthermore, the success of the SLAC Linear
Collider [22] and the subsequent work on the International
Linear Collider [23] allow a new Super-B collider to also
incorporate linear collider techniques. This note describes
the initial parameters of a linearly colliding asymmetric B-
Factory collider at a luminosity of order 1036 cm−2s−1. Such
a collider would produce an integrated luminosity of about
10,000 fb−1 (10 ab−1) in a running year (107 sec). Design
studies are continuing to improve these parameters.

14. DESIGN FROM PAST SUCCESSES

The construction and operation of modern multi-bunch
e+e− colliders have brought about many advances in accel-
erator physics in the area of high currents, complex inter-
action regions, high beam-beam tune shifts, high power RF
systems, controlled beam instabilities, rapid injection rates,
and reliable uptimes (∼ 95%).

The present successful B-Factories have proven that their

design concepts are valid:

1. Colliders with asymmetric energies can work.

16

2. Beam-beam energy transparency conditions are weak.

16. LUMINOSITY

3. Interaction regions with two energies can work.

4. IR backgrounds can be handled successfully.

5. High current RF systems can be operated (3 A×1.8 A).

6. Beam-beam parameters can reach 0.06 to 0.09.

7. Injection rates are good and continuous injection is

done in production.

8. The electron cloud eﬀect (ECI) can be managed.

9. Bunch-by-bunch feedbacks at the 4 nsec spacing work

well.

Lessons learned from linear collider studies have also shown
new successful concepts:

The design of a 1036 cm−2s−1 e+e− collider combines ex-
tensions of the design of the present B Factories and linear
collider concepts to allow improved beam parameters to be
achieved. The luminosity L in an e+e− collider is given by
the expression

N+N−nb fcHd
4πσxσy

L =

σ =

βǫ

p

where nb is the number of bunches, fc is the frequency of
collision of each bunch, N is the number of particles in the
positron (+) and electron (−) bunches, Hd is the disruption
enhancement factor from the collisions, σ is the beam size in
the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) directions, ǫ is the beam
emittance and β is the beta function (cm) at the collision
point for each plane.

1. Bunch energy and energy spread compensation of
multiple bunches in a high power linac can be done.

2. Small horizontal and vertical emittances can be pro-
duced in a damping ring with a short damping time.

3. Superconducting linacs can be used with short high-

charge bunches.

recovery.

4. Superconducting linacs can be used for beam energy

5. Transverse beam kickers with fast switching times and

excellent stability can be produced.

6. Bunch length compression can be successfully per-

formed.

All of the above techniques will be incorporated in the design
of a future linear Super-B Factory collider.

15. DESIGN STATUS

The concept of combining linear and circular collider
ideas to make a linear-circular B-Factory was discussed in
the late 1980’s, although only circular B-Factories were built
in the 1990’s. Recent advances in B-Factory performance
and solid linear collider design progress has reopened this
design avenue.

The design presented here is very recent and on-going.
There are new ideas emerging on the weekly time scale and
some time will be needed to allow these new ideas to be
incorporated into the ultimate design. The parameters pre-
sented here are preliminary but with the intent to be self-
consistent.

Schematic drawings of a Linear Super-B Factory are
shown in Figure 13 and 14. The operation is described here.
A positron bunch from a 2 GeV damping ring is extracted
and accelerated to 7 GeV in a superconducting (SC) linac.
Simultaneously, an electron bunch is generated in a gun and
accelerated in a separate SC linac to 4 GeV. The two bunches
are prepared to collide in a transport line where the bunch
lengths are shortened. These bunches are focused to a small
spot at the collisions point and made to collide. The spent
beams are returned to their respective linacs with transport
lines where they return their energies to the SC accelerator.
The 2 GeV positrons are returned to the damping ring to re-
store the low emittances. The spent electron beam is dis-
carded. The process is repeated with the next bunch. It is
expected that each bunch will collide about 120 times each
second and that there will be about 10000 bunches. Thus,
the collision rate is about 1.2 MHz. A small electron linac
and positron source are used to replenish lost positrons in the
colliding process and natural beam lifetime. See Figure 13.
An alternative (see Figure 14) electron source is to use a
2 GeV damping ring to store and collide electrons in a similar
fashion to positrons. This scheme would reduce the demands
on the electron gun but increase the site AC power.

19. BEAM-BEAM CALCULATIONS

The beam-beam interaction in a linear collider is basically
the same Coulomb interaction as in a storage ring collider,
with extremely high charge densities at IP, leading to very
intense ﬁelds; since in this case quantum behavior becomes
important it is necessary to use a beam-beam code to predict
luminosities and related backgrounds. The “classical” eﬀects
of the beam-beam interaction are characterized by a param-
eter called “disruption”, which can be seen as the equivalent
to what the linear beam-beam tune shift is in storage rings.
Typical values for D in the vertical plane are less than 30
in ILC, and more than 50 in a “linearly colliding” SuperB-

18

Factory. The horizontal Ds are kept near or below 1 to re-
duce energy spread in the beam. The beam-beam interaction
in such a regime can be highly non linear and unstable, lead-
ing to loss of luminosity, rather than gain, and to emittance
blow-up. Since the beams must be recovered in this scheme,
emittance blow-up should be kept at minimum in order to
decrease the number of damping time necessary before the
beams can collide again.

Let’s now recall some of the scaling laws that can help in

the choice of the collision parameters.

The beam-beam disruption is deﬁned as:

D±

x,y =

γ±σ∓

N∓σ∓
z
x + σ∓
σ∓
y (cid:17)

x,y (cid:16)
where N is the number of particles in one bunch, σz is the
bunch length, γ is the beam energy in terms of electron mass,
σx and σy are the beam spot sizes at collision. All the quan-
tities refer to the opposite beam, except for the beam energy
factor.

On the other hand the luminosity is proportional to:

L ∝

N2
σxσy(cid:17)
(cid:16)
and the center of mass (cm) energy spread during collision
can be deﬁned as:

σcm

E ∝

N2
σ2
xσz

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

∝

DxN
σ2
z

∝

Lσy
(σxσz)

For “linearly colliding” beams a large contribution to the
energy spread comes from the beam-beam interaction via
the “beamstrahlung”, synchrotron radiation produced during
collision. Due to the high ﬁelds at the interaction the beams
lose more energy and the cm energy spread increases. This
is an unwanted eﬀect, since the Υ(4S ) is relatively narrow,
so the cm energy spread should be as small as possible.

As it can be seen from the previous formulas there are
conﬂicting requirements for the collision parameters. In fact
increasing the number of particles gives higher luminosity
but also higher energy spread. Also, a short bunch gives less
∗ can be decreased
disruption and more luminosity, since βy
without having hourglass eﬀect, but produces larger cm en-
ergy spread.

The strong-strong collision regime requires a simulation,
since analytical treatment is limited. Preliminary beam-beam
studies have been performed with the “GuineaPig” com-
puter code by D. Schulte (CERN) [24], which includes back-
grounds calculations, pinch eﬀect, kink instability, quantum
eﬀects, energy loss, and luminosity spectrum. This code has
been intensely used for ILC studies of beam-beam perfor-
mances and backgrounds.

Some time has been spent in optimizing the “simulation”
parameters, such as the number of longitudinal slices, macro-
particles, grid sizes, etc... versus the computing time. Then
an intensive study of the luminosity as a function of number
N, bunch length, beam spot sizes, beam emittances and en-
ergy asymmetry has been performed, while trying to keep

small the cm energy spread and the outgoing beam emit-
tances.

Some preliminary conclusions can be drawn from the
large number of runs performed with diﬀerent collision pa-
rameters:

• the bunch length should be as short as possible, this
∗ and luminosity, and gives less

allows to increase βy
disruption;

• given the maximum storable beam current in the
Damping Ring the number of bunches should be as
small as possible, i.e. the number of particles/bunch
should be as high as possible (see for example Fig. 2),
compatibly with the increase of the cm energy spread;

• the horizontal emittance should be increased so to
minimize D: in this case less time is needed to damp
the spent beams. The corresponding luminosity loss
can be recovered by increasing the collision frequency;

• increasing the beam aspect ratio, i.e. having very ﬂat
beams, helps to overcome the kink instability. As a
result the spent beam emittances are less disrupted, Dy
is smaller and the cm energy spread is not aﬀected by
the interaction.

one longitudinal bunch slice.

FIG. 17: Plot of the LER (y, y′) phase space. Each color refers to
one longitudinal bunch slice.

In this particular case the disruption is very high in the
vertical plane. This is what gives a large emittance blow-
up. Also under study are other possibilities to reduce the
emittance growth due to the collision.

The traveling focus scheme relaxes the requirements on
the incoming vertical emittance together with a reduced dis-
ruption during the collision.

The four-beam DCI-like [25] beam charge compensation
scheme (allowing the beams to collide again before be-
ing sent back into the Linac), it is also promising, since it
could greatly reduce the disruption, allowing much smaller
IP sizes, together with very little emittance growth, relaxing
the requirements on beam current and damping time.

These studies are still in progress.

As an example of spent beams emittances, in Figs.16 and
17 the (x, x′) and (y, y′) space phase plots after collision for
both beams, with the parameters in Table VI, are shown. The
diﬀerent colors refer to diﬀerent longitudinal bunch slices,
from the bunch head to the bunch tail.

In Figs. 20 and 21 the simulated beams, before and after
collision, are shown. The low energy beam is red, the high
energy beam is green.

disrupted beams need large aperture magnets to contain the
beam with a minimum of loss. The reduced collision fre-
quency (100 kHz – 1 MHz) of the SuperB Factory permits
the introduction of pulsed magnetic elements.

The plan to collide the two beams head-on and let the ex-
iting beam travel through the two ﬁnal focus magnets of the
other beam. The exiting high-energy beam will be under-
focused by the incoming low-energy beam (LEB) ﬁnal focus
magnets. Two pulsed quadrupole magnets will be used to
add additional focusing for the outgoing high-energy beam
(HEB). These pulsed magnets will operate only on the outgo-
ing HEB and not be energized for the incoming LEB. The in-
coming LEB will be steered to the ﬁnal focus trajectory by a
pulsed dipole that will be outboard of the pulsed quadrupoles
mentioned above. The pulsed dipole on the incoming LEB
allows the beams to be separated and the out-going HEB then
enters its own beam pipe.

On the other side of the IP the outgoing LEB is over-
focused by the incoming HEB ﬁnal focus magnets. Again
two pulsed quadrupole magnets will be used to help capture
the disrupted LEB. The LEB is then steered out of the way
by a pulsed dipole magnet allowing it to enter its own beam

INTERACTION REGION PARAMETERS

The interaction region is being designed to leave the same
longitudinal free space as that presently used by BABAR but
with superconducting quadrupole doublets as close to the in-
teraction region as possible.

Recent work at Brookhaven National Laboratory on pre-
cision conductor placement of superconductors in large-bore
low-ﬁeld magnets has led to quadrupoles in successful use
in the interaction regions for the HERA collider in Germany
[26]. A minor redesign of these magnets will work well for
the Super B Factory.

The reduced energy asymmetry (7 GeV×4 GeV) of the
SuperB factory makes it extremely diﬃcult to separate the
beams, especially if the collision is head-on. However, the
low emittance of the incoming beams helps since the mag-
netic apertures can be small. On the other hand, the exiting

21. LINAC PARAMETERS

The SC linear accelerator will have a design similar to the
International Linear Collider (ILC) SC structures with a fre-
quency of 1428 MHz. Higher Order mode (HOM) damping
will be needed similar to the ILC. Since these structures will
be powered at all times, an accelerating gradient of about
8 MV/m is assumed here with a ﬁlling factor of 0.7 similar
to the ILC. Thus, a tunnel length of about 200 m is needed
for each GeV of acceleration including beam loading. The
klystron power needed here will be much lower than the ILC
as the energy is recovered for each bunch.

22. DAMPING RING PARAMETERS

The damping rings for each beam will have a total circum-
ference if 6 km but two 3 km rings per particle type may be
better. The ﬁrst ring will have a very short damping time to
reduce the transverse emittance. It will have a relatively large
energy loss and large equilibrium emittances. The second
ring will have softer bends to have smaller ﬁnal emittances.
Preliminary damping ring parameters are listed in Table VII.
Their characteristics are very similar to the ones studied
for ILC [23]. The ILC-DR has the same length and emit-
tances very similar to the ones required for the Super-B. The
ILC damping time is longer, so more wigglers are needed
here. A careful re-optimization of the ring lattice has to be
done in order to have a good dynamic aperture. The addi-
tional wigglers together with the increased beam current cir-
culating in the ring (about a factor 5) will be a serious con-
cern for the electron-cloud instability. The other collective
eﬀects will also be worse, despise the small beneﬁt from the
shorter damping time. In addition we would like to have the

cles are green.

pipe.

This design minimizes synchrotron radiation (SR) gener-
ated by the HEB since the HEB runs straight through the
Interaction Region (IR). The SR fan from the incoming LEB
pulsed dipole must be shielded from the detector beam pipe.
The remaining primary sources of SR that can be a back-
ground for the detector, are generated by the ﬁnal focus
quadrupoles for both incoming beams. This SR must be
masked from the detector beam pipe as well. The low emit-
tance of the incoming beams allows us to have a radius for
the detector beam pipe of about 1 cm.

The masking for the detector beam pipe will be close to
the beam pipe in Z. This means that there will be scattered
photons from the mask tips and (most likely) photons strik-
ing the inside surfaces of the masks from SR generated from
the incoming beam on the other side of the IP. This means
that the detector Be beam pipe will need to have the inside
surface coated with a high-Z material (most likely gold) in
order to minimize the SR background in the detector.

Fig. 7 shows a possible IR layout. After passing through
the collision point (IP) HER and the LER beams are then
steered away from the incoming beam magnets with fast

recovery of the beams will not be a large source.

INJECTOR CONCEPT AND PARAMETERS

The injector for the SuperB will make up for lost particles
during the storage time in the damping rings and the losses
from collisions. The injector will be similar to the SLAC
injector delivering about 5×1010 electrons or positrons per
pulse at about 40 Hz each.

24. BUNCH COMPRESSION

The bunch compression system needs to compress the
bunches between a factor of 5 to 10 from 2-3 mm to 0.4-
0.3 mm. Compression is done by adding an head-tail energy
correlation in each bunch and then passing it through a trans-
port line with dispersion. Since the initial energy spread in
the damping rings is very small, the induced energy spread
for compression will be about 1×10−3. Perhaps a multi-stage
compressor like in ILC will be required. The compressor
could be integrated with the SC accelerator in order to fully
optimize the bunch length, its proﬁle (a rectangular distribu-
tion is probably desired) and the ﬁnal energy spread. The
average dispersion needs to be about 1 m over a bend angle
of about 3 radians.

25. POWER REQUIREMENTS

26. SYNERGY WITH ILC

There are many similarities between this linear Super-B
collider and the ILC. The project described here will capi-
talize on R&D projects that have been concluded or are on-
going with the ILC collaboration.

The damping rings between the two projects are very sim-
ilar. Many of the parameters are close such as energy (2-
5 GeV), circumference (3-6 km), bunch spacing (3-8 nsec),
damping times (4-10 msec), and emittances (3-10 nm hori-
zontally and 0.002-0.001 nm vertically). Most of the beam
dynamics are due to multi-bunch eﬀects which aﬀect both
designs. The electron cloud eﬀects will aﬀect both rings in a
similar fashion. Both RF frequencies are in the range of 400
to 700 MHz.

The SC linacs have very similar characteristics including
gradients (5-25 MV/m), bunch spacing (∼ 300 nsec), and
bunch charges (1-10×1010).

The interaction regions have very similar characteristics
with ﬂat beams and geometries. The ratio of IP beta func-
tions are nearly the same (10-30 mm horizontally and 0.3-
1 mm vertically). The collimation schemes should be simi-
lar. The possibility and techniques to use traveling focusing
will be similar, if needed. The chromatic corrections of the
ﬁnal doublets using sextupoles will be the same.

All the beams will need bunch-by-bunch feedbacks to
keep the beam instabilities and beam-beam collisions under
control. With the bunch spacing very similar, the feedback
kickers, digital controls, and beam impedance remediation
will have common designs. The IP feedback from bunch-to-
bunch will work exactly in the same way except that the re-
quired SuperB Factory magnets will be much weaker. There
will be many opportunities to use feed-forward to correct
bunch steering in advance of the bunch arrival in the SuperB
design.

27. OTHER UPGRADE POSSIBILITIES

Additional improvements are being considered for this de-

sign.

1) A traveling focus scheme in the interaction region could
help the beam-bean interaction and increase the luminosity
or reduce the beam-beam blowup allowing the bunches to
collide more frequently.

2) A monochromator scheme could be used to reduce the
energy spread tolerances in the interaction region and allow
a simpler damping ring or enhanced luminosity.

3) The SC linac could be “doubled up” to be used by more

than one beam to reduce the construction cost.

The power required by a collider is the sum of a site base
and the accelerator operation. The damping ring power to
replace the synchrotron radiation loss will be the dominate

4) A four-beam collision scheme could be used to signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the eﬀects of the beam-beam interaction allow-
ing a much higher collision rate.

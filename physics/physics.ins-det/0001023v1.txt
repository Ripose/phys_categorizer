Abstract

We present measurements of mechanical vibrations induced by 0.6 GeV elec-
trons impinging on cylindrical and spherical aluminium resonators. To monitor the
amplitude of the resonator’s vibrational modes we used piezoelectric ceramic sen-
sors, calibrated by standard accelerometers. Calculations using the thermo-acoustic
conversion model, agree well with the experimental data, as demonstrated by the
speciﬁc variation of the excitation strengths with the absorbed energy, and with the
traversing particles’ track positions. For the ﬁrst longitudinal mode of the cylindri-
cal resonator we measured a conversion factor of 7.4 ± 1.4 nm/J, conﬁrming the
model value of 10 nm/J. Also, for the spherical resonator, we found the model values
for the L=2 and L=1 mode amplitudes to be consistent with our measurement. We
thus have conﬁrmed the applicability of the model, and we note that calculations
based on the model have shown that next generation resonant mass gravitational
wave detectors can only be expected to reach their intended ultra high sensitivity if
they will be shielded by an appreciable amount of rock, where a veto detector can
reduce the background of remaining impinging cosmic rays eﬀectively.

Introduction

A key issue for a Resonant Mass Gravitational Wave Detector [1] of improved sen-
sitivity with respect to the existing detectors, is the background due to impinging
cosmic ray particles [2, 3]. The energy deposited in the detector’s mass along a
particle’s track may excite the very vibrational modes that are to signal the pass-
ing of a gravitational wave. Computer simulations of such eﬀects are based on the
thermo-acoustic conversion model and earlier measurements of resonant eﬀects in
Beron et al. [4] and Grassi Strini et al. [5]. According to the model, the energy de-
posited by a traversing particle heats the material locally around the particle track,
which leads to mechanical tension and thereby excites acoustic vibrational modes
[6]. At a strain sensitivity of the order of 10−21 envisaged for a next generation
gravitational-wave detector, computer simulations [3, 7] show that operation of the
instrument at the surface of the earth would be prohibited by the eﬀect of the cos-
mic ray background. Since the applicability of the thermo-acoustic conversion model
would thus yield an important constraint on the operating conditions of resonant
mass gravitational wave detectors, Grassi-Strini, Strini and Tagliaferri [5] measured
the mechanical vibrations in a bar resonator bombarded by 0.02 GeV protons and
5*10−4 GeV electrons. We extended that experiment by measuring the excitation
patterns in more detail for a bar and a sphere excited by 0.6 GeV electrons. Even
though we cannot think of a reason why the model, if applicable to the bar, would
not hold for a sphere, we did turn to measuring with a sphere also.
We exposed [8] two aluminium 50ST alloy cylindrical bars and an aluminium alloy
sphere, each equipped with piezoelectric ceramic sensors, to a beam of ≈ 0.6 GeV
electrons used in single bunch mode with a pulse width of up to ≈ 2µs, and ad-
justable intensity of 109 to 1010 electrons. We recorded the signals from the piezo
sensors, and Fourier analysed their time series. Before and after the beam run we
calibrated the sensor response of one of the bars for its ﬁrst longitudinal vibrational
mode at ≈ 13 kHz to calibrated accelerometers.

2 Experiment setup and method

In the experiment we used three diﬀerent setups in various runs, as summarised in
table I: two bars and a sphere. With the un-calibrated bar BU we explored the
feasibility of the measurement. Also, bar BU proved useful to indirectly determine
the relative excitation amplitudes of higher longitudinal vibrational modes, see sec.
4.1. With bar BC calibrated at its ﬁrst longitudinal vibrational mode, we measured
directly its excitation amplitude in the beam. Finally, with the sphere we further
explored the applicability of the model.

2.1 Electron beam

We used the Amsterdam linear electron accelerator MEA [9, 10] delivering an elec-
tron beam with a pulse-width of up to 2 µs in its hand-triggered, single bunch
mode. The amount of charge per beam pulse was varied, recorded by a calibrated
digital oscilloscope, photographed and analysed oﬀ line to determine the number of
impinging electrons per burst.

2.2 Suspension and positioning

In both setups BC and BU, see ﬁg. 1, the cylindrical aluminium bar was horizontally
suspended in the middle, as indicated in the ﬁgure, with a plastic string. The bar’s

plane.

cylinder axis was positioned at 900 to the beam direction. The bar’s suspension
string was connected to a horizontally movable gliding construction, enabling us to

handle the resonator by remote control, and let the impinging electron beam hit it at
diﬀerent horizontal positions. The aluminium sphere SU, see ﬁg. 2, was suspended
from its centre by a brass rod. Either the bar’s gliding construction, or the sphere’s
suspension bar, was attached to an aluminium tripod mounted inside a vacuum
chamber [9], which was evacuated to about 10−5 mbar. By remote control, we
rotated the tripod and moved it vertically to either let the beam pass the resonator
completely, or let it traverse the resonator. We let the beam traverse the sphere
at diﬀerent heights and diﬀerent incident angles with respect to the piezo sensors
positions on the sphere. We mark the beam heights as E (Equator) and A (Africa)

at 0.022 m below the equator. The E beam passed horizontally through the sphere’s
origin, remaining in the same vertical plane for the A beam.

2.3 Sensors and signal processing

In setup BC we used a single piezo sensor of ≈ 15 ∗ 3 ∗ 1 mm3 and glued it over it
full length at 0.01 m oﬀ the centre on the top of the bar. Bar BC was equipped with
a capacitor plate of 0.03 m diameter at a distance of ≈ 0.004 m from one of its end
faces. In setup BU one piezo sensor of ≈ 3 ∗ 6 ∗ 0.3 mm3 was ﬁxed on one end face
of the bar.
A similar sensor of about the same dimensions was ﬁxed in the same manner, ori-
ented parallel to the cylinder’s long axis at a position 35 mm away from the end-face,
In the third setup, SU, see ﬁg. 2, two piezo sensors of ≈ 3 ∗ 6 ∗ 0.3 mm3 were glued
to the sphere’s surface. One was situated at the equator, with respect to the vertical
rotation axis, the other one at a relative displacement of 450 west longitude, and at
450 north latitude.
For the setup in use, each sensor was connected to a charge ampliﬁer of ≈ 2∗1010 V/C
gain. The signals were sent through a Krohn-Hite 3202R low-pass 100 kHz pre-ﬁlter,

to a R9211C Advantest spectrum analyser with internal 2 MHz pre-sampling and
125 kHz digital low-pass ﬁltering. The oscillation signals were recorded for 64 ms
periods at a 4 µs sample rate. The beam pulse could be used as a delayed trigger to
the Advantest. Using the memory option of the Advantest, the piezo signals were
recorded from 0.3 ms onward before the arrival of the trigger. The data were stored
on disk and were Fourier analysed oﬀ line.

2.4 Checks and stability

The data were taken at an ambient temperature of ≈ 23 0C. By exciting the res-
onator with the piezo-hammer we checked roughly its overall performance. As to
be discussed in section 3, setup BC was calibrated before and after the beam run.
The instrument’s stability was checked several times during the run by an electric
driving signal on its capacitor endplate.

3 Calibration of bar BC’s piezo ceramic sensor

A standard accelerometer mounted on the bar damped the vibrations too strongly
to conﬁdently measure their excitations in the electron beam. Therefore the re-
sponse of the piezoelectric ceramic together with its ampliﬁer was ﬁrst calibrated
against two 2.4 gramme Bruel&Kjaer 4375 accelerometers glued, one at a time, to
bar BC’s end face and connected to a 2635 charge ampliﬁer. The resonator was
excited through air by a nearby positioned loud-speaker driven from the Advantest
digitally tunable sine-wave generator. The output signals from both the piezoelec-
tric ceramic ampliﬁer and the accelerometer ampliﬁer were fed into the Advantest.
Stored time series were read out by an Apple Mac 8100 AV, running Lab-View for
on-line Fourier analysis, peak selection, amplitude and decay time determination.
We took nine calibration runs varying the charge ampliﬁer’s sensitivity setting, and
dismounting and remounting either of the two accelerometers to the bar. For the
lowest longitudinal vibrational mode we calculated the ratio of the Fourier peak
signal amplitudes, R, from the piezoelectric ceramic and accelerometer.
With the calibrated bar BC positioned in the electron beam line we checked the
stability of the piezoelectric ceramic’s response intermittently with the beam runs
by exciting the bar through its capacitor plate at one end face, electrically driving it
at and around half the bar’s resonance frequency. We found the response to remain
stable within a few percent.
After the beam runs we took additional calibration values in air with a newly ac-
quired Bruel&Kjaer 0.5 g 4374S subminiature accelerometer and a Nexus 2692 AOS4
charge ampliﬁer. In ﬁg. 3, typical frequency responses are shown when driving the
bar by a loud-speaker signal. The upper part gives the Fourier peak amplitude
of the bar’s 13 kHz resonance as measured with the accelerometer. The lower part
gives the corresponding amplitude for the signal from the piezoelectric ceramic. The

tic frequency of bar BC’s piezo (lower) and accelerom-

piezo peak of constant amplitude at 6.5 kHz arising from
crosstalk is absent in the accelerometer, while the acous-
tic resonance is clearly seen at 13 kHz in both.

right hand side of the picture shows the amplitudes to be smaller, as expected when
driving the bar slightly oﬀ resonance. We calculate the decay time, τ , of the k-th
mode amplitude Ak(t) = Ak(0) · e−t/τ to be τ = 0.4 s for this setup, equipped with
the relatively light accelerometer.
Figure 4 shows the corresponding two signals when driving the bar by the capacitor
plate at 6.5 kHz, that is at half the bar’s resonance frequency. Here, the direct elec-
tric response of the piezoelectric ceramic’s signal to the driving sine-wave is present,
clearly without a mechanic signal, as would have shown up in the accelerometer.
The direct signal at 6.5 kHz remains constant. On the other hand, the bar’s me-
chanical signals on and oﬀ its resonance frequency around 13 kHz show the expected
amplitude change again, thereby demonstrating that around the bar’s resonance, the
piezoelectric ceramic does only respond to the mechanical signal, not to the electric
driving signal. See also the caption of ﬁg. 4.

4 Beam experiments

Sensor signals way above the noise level were observed for every beam pulse hitting
the sphere or the bar. We ascertained that: a) the signals arose from mechanical
vibrations in the resonator, and b) they were directly initiated by the eﬀect of the
beam on the resonator, and not arising from an indirect eﬀect of the beam on the
piezo sensors. Our assertion is based on a combination of test results observed for
both the bars and the sphere, as now to be discussed.

the piezo sensors signals on the sphere (upper and lower
traces).

Figure 6: A typical Fourier spectrum of bar BC as
excited by the electron beam. Data were analysed over
0.016 s duration, from 0.008 s onwards after the beam
passed. Identiﬁed vibrational modes are indicated.

First, when the beam passed underneath the resonator without hitting it, we
observed no sensor signal above the noise. Second, as shown in ﬁg. 5, the sensors’
delayed responses after the impact of the beam agreed with the sound velocity. Here
the beam was hitting the sphere at a position 5 mm above the sphere’s south pole.
The middle trace shows the beam pulse of ≈ 2µs duration. The two other traces
show both piezo sensors to respond with a transient signal right from the start time
of the beam’s arrival and to begin oscillating after some delay, depending on their
distance from the beam. The distance of the equatorial sensor to the beam hitting
the sphere at the south pole was 0.11 m, corresponding to ≈ 22 µs travel time for
a sound velocity of ≈ 5 ∗ 103 m/s. The signal is indeed seen in the lowest trace
starting to oscillate at that delay time. The upper trace shows the signal from the
second sensor situated on the northern hemisphere at 0.14 m from the traversing
beam, correspondingly starting to oscillate with a delay of ≈ 28 µs after the impact
of the beam. Third, after dismounting the piezo-hammer from the resonator, we
observed that the sensor signals did not change, which showed that the activation
is not caused by the beam inducing a triggering of the piezo-hammer. Fourth, to

simulate the electric eﬀect of the beam pulse on the sensors, we coupled a direct
current of 60 mA and 2.5 µs duration from a wave packet generator to the bar.
Apart from the direct response of the piezo-sensor during the input driving wave,
no oscillatory signal was detected above the noise level. Finally, we measured the
dependence of the amplitudes in several vibrational modes on the hit position of the
beam, as will be described in the following sections. We found the amplitudes to
follow the patterns as calculated with the thermo-acoustic conversion model.

4.1 Results for the bar

In ﬁg. 6 a typical Fourier spectrum of bar BC is shown up to 55 kHz. The arrows
point to identiﬁed vibrational modes [11]. From a ﬁt of K and f0 of the longitudinal
frequencies fL = L · f0 · (1 − L2K) [12] of the modes for L=1,..,4, we ﬁnd f0 =
12933, K = 0.0022, where f0 is related to the sound velocity by vs = 2l ∗ f0 =
5173 m/s for our bar length of l=0.2 m. For the Poisson-ratio σ = 2l√K/(πr), r
being the cylinder radius of the bar, from our ﬁt we get σ = 0.338. The values agree
well with the handbook [13] quoting σ=0.33 and vs=5000 m/s for aluminium. The
root mean square error of the ﬁt is 35 Hz, in correspondence with the 30 Hz frequency
resolution used in the Fourier analysis. Other peaks correspond to torsional and
transverse modes [11, 12].

Figure 8: The measured, unnormalised Fourier ampli-
tudes (+) and model calculations (–) as a function of
the beam hit position along the cylinder axis for the
four lowest longitudinal modes of bar BC.

The Fourier amplitudes Ak of f (t) = P Akeiωkt of the modes depend linearly (as
shown for the 13 kHz, L=1 mode in ﬁg. 7) on the integrated charge in the beam
pulse for a ﬁxed beam position, and therefore also linearly on the energy deposited
by the beam, which ranged in these runs from 0.06-0.8 J. The spread in the ratios

of the amplitudes to the beam charge, shows the Fourier amplitudes to reproduce
within ± 10%.
The agreement of the model to within 10% with the measured data is shown in
ﬁg. 8. The ﬁgure shows the measured Fourier amplitudes of bar BC at the piezo
sensor and the calculations following Grassi Strini et al. [5, 14] as a function of the
hit position along the cylinder axis for the ﬁrst four longitudinal modes. For each
mode the average model value was scaled to the average measured value. The best
ﬁt was found with a shift of the hit positions along the bar, by an overall oﬀset
of x0=-0.0075 m, which corresponds to the crude way we aligned the bar with the
beam line.

4.1.1 Lowest bar mode excitation amplitude

For the 13 kHz, L=1 mode we determine the absolute amplitude for a comparison
with the model calculation of ref. [5, 14]. Firstly, we use the amplitude function
B0(x), see eq. 9 of ref. [5, 14], by rewriting it in the form:

B0(x) = 2 · κ0 · ∆E/π × cos(πx/l)sin(πη/(2l))/πη/(2l)

with

κ0 = α · l/(cv · M) = α/(cv · ρO).

(2)

(3)

In this expressions x is the hit position along the the cylinder axis, l the bar length,
η the beam diameter, α the thermal linear expansion coeﬃcient, ρ the density, cv the
speciﬁc heat, O the cylindrical surface area of the bar, and ∆E the energy absorbed
by the bar. From B0(x) we derive the functional form for the measured values of
Wsens as

Wsens(x) =

B0(x)
∆E

βD

dE
dQ

(4)

where dE/dQ is the beam energy absorbed by the bar per unit of impinging beam
charge, β the calibration factor as discussed in section 3, and D the decay factor
e−t/τ , since eq. 2 applies at excitation time and we have to correct the amplitude at
measuring time for the mode’s decay, corresponding to its Q-factor. Therefore,

Wsens(x) = κexp2/π × cos(πx/l)sin(πη/(2l))/πη/(2l),

with

κexp = βDκ0

dE
dQ

(5)

(6)

From ﬁtting eq. 5 to the measured values Wsens(x) given in table II with κexp as the
free variable, we ﬁnd our presently measured value for κexp
0 = κexp · /(dE/dQ· D · β)
which we compare to the model value in eq. 3. Secondly, the decay time was
measured by recording the sensor signals after a trigger delayed by up to 1.6 s at a

ﬁxed beam hit position. An exponential ﬁt A(t) = A0 ∗ e−t/τ to the mode amplitude
gives τ = (0.36 ± 0.01) s for the L=1 mode. This corresponds to a Q-value of
≈ 15000, a value consistent with the room temperature measurement of aluminium
as in ref. [15], and indicating a negligible inﬂuence of the suspension and piezoelectric
ceramic sensor for this mode. From the measured value of τ and a mean delay time
from the start of the beam pulse of 0.016 s, we calculate the decay factor to be
D = 0.95.

amplitude and the measured beam pulse charge at each of the indicated hit
positions on the bar for the 13 kHz, L=1 mode.

Thirdly, as indicated, we use the data for Wsens in the second row of table II to
ﬁt the variable κexp in eq. 5, where now x is the hit position as given in row 1,
l=0.2 m , and η = 0.002 m. The value found in the ﬁt is κexp = (0.300 ± 0.025)
V/nC. Fourthly, from a Monte Carlo simulation at the beam energy of 570 MeV
used for these runs, we calculate the mean absorbed energy and the mean energy
spread which results from the ﬂuctuating energy losses of the passing electrons and
the energies of the secondaries escaping from the bar, as ∆Ee=(19± 2) MeV. The
electron beam pulse thus deposits dE/dQ = (0.019± 0.002) J/nC in the bar. Using
the measured calibration value at f=12986 Hz as given in eq. 1, β=(2.2 ± 0.3) V/nm,
we arrive at

κexp
0 = (7.4 ± 1.4) nm/J.

(7)

Finally, we calculate the model value of κ0 from the material constants as being
κ0=10 nm/J, neglecting the much smaller error as arising from some uncertainty in
the parameters. We conclude that κexp
0 /κ0 = (0.74± 0.14), a result that is consistent
with the validity of the model of ref. [5, 14].
The measured maximum excitation amplitude at beam position x=0, see ﬁg. 8 for
the 13 kHz, L=1 longitudinal mode thus corresponds to (0.13 ± 0.02) nm.

4.1.2 Higher bar mode excitation amplitudes

Having determined the correspondence between the model calculation and the ex-
periment’s result for the ﬁrst longitudinal vibrational mode amplitude, we return to
some of the higher vibrational modes. To compare the modes we need to take the
sensor position on the bar into account. We rewrite the displacement amplitude of
eq. 5 from ref. [5] as a function of hit position xh and sensor position xs as:

Φodd−L = (2κ/Lπ)sin(Lπxs/l)cos(Lπxh/l),
Φeven−L = (2κ/Lπ)cos(Lπxs/l)sin(Lπxh/l),

(8)

where l is the bar length. We dropped the beam width correction term which
would lead to a less than 0.1% correction even for L=4. We approximate the sensor
response by the local strain along bar BC’s cylinder axis, that is to the dΦ/dxs of
eq. 8, arriving at a sensor response, SL:

Sodd−L = BLcos(Lπxh/l), Bodd−L = (2ǫκ/l)cos(Lπxs/l),
Seven−L = BLsin(Lπxh/l), Beven−L = (2ǫκ/l)sin(Lπxs/l),

(9)

0

where ǫ is a sensor response parameter. The xs dependent term did not enter into
the calculation of κexp
in the previous section, since the calibration was done at the
same sensor position as the beam measurement. However, for a comparison between
the modes, the dependence on the sensor position xs has to be taken into account.
Since the variables are strongly correlated, we, ﬁrst, ﬁtted for each mode the term
BL in the xh dependent part of eq. 9 to the measured value of Wsens for the mode,
shifting the origin of xh by 0.0075 m, as mentioned before. The results are given in
the ﬁrst row of table III.

Second, we corrected the amplitudes Bmeas

for the mode decay with a factor
D, given in row 2, and corresponding to the times τ1 = 0.36 s, τ2 = 0.10 s, τ3 =
0.04 s, τ4 = 0.12 s, which leads to the values of Bexp
in row 3. Finally, we multiplied
L
with the factor Podd−L = 1/cos(Lπxs/l), Peven−L = 1/sin(Lπxs/l), where the bar
length is l=0.2 m. Since the sensor extends from 0.005 through 0.020 m from the
center of the bar, we use the mean sensor position xs = 0.0125 m. The resulting
values of κ′ = 2ǫκ/l, shown in the last row, should be independent of L. For L=2,3,4
they are rather closely scattered around a mean value of κ′ = 0.07 which is, however,
at about half the L=1 value. This discrepancy might have originated from some
resonances of the sensor itself, and we suspect the strong peak at 23 kHz, shown in
ﬁgure 6, to be an indication of such resonances playing a role.
Since the amplitudes of the higher modes for bar BC do not comply with our ex-
pectations we turn, as a further check, to our un-calibrated measurements with bar
BU. It had been equipped with a piezoelectric sensor at one end face where the
longitudinal modes have maximum amplitude. The sensor had been mounted ﬂatly
with about half of its surface glued to the bar, and responding to the bar’s sur-
face acceleration, not its strain as at bar BC. We extract the κL values from our
measurement analogously as for bar BC, following again the model calculations of
Grassi Strini et al. [5], using the L=1 mode as the reference. The results are given
in table IV.

for the L=1, 13 kHz mode is used

After applying the decay correction factor D and the frequency normalisation
factor Ω, the results should be independent of L. The L=4 value is signiﬁcantly
low, which, again, might be due to some interfering resonance. The L=2 and L=3
values, however, do not signiﬁcantly deviate from the L=1 value, thus conﬁrming
the model calculations for these higher modes too.

4.2 Results for the sphere

Our measurements on the sphere consisted of a) hitting the sphere with the beam
at one of two heights in the vertically oriented plane through its suspension: at the
equator (E) and at 0.022 m southward (A); b) rotating the sphere with its two ﬁxed
sensors over 1800 around the suspension axis at each beam height, and measuring
several times back and forth by steps of 300 to diminish the inﬂuence of temperature
and beam ﬂuctuations, ending up on a 100 angular lattice. The Fourier amplitude

sphere SU averaged over all measured angles for sensor-

spectrum of sensor-1, averaged over the angular positions, is shown in ﬁg. 9. The
lowest spheroidal mode is most relevant for a spherical resonant mass gravitational

wave detector, and we therefore focus on a few spheroidal modes. As expected,
the lowest spheroidal L=2 mode is seen at 17.6 kHz, the lowest spheroidal L=1
mode at 24 kHz, and the lowest spheroidal L=0 mode at 37 kHz. Some other peaks
are also indicated in the ﬁgure, though not the toroidal modes, which we neglect
completely. It should be noted that while the L 6=0 amplitudes oscillate over the
angles, the L=0 amplitude does not, leading to a relative enhancement of the latter
in the angle-averaged ﬁg. 9.
The Fourier amplitudes, again, showed a linear dependence on the deposited energy.
To determine the decay times at f =17.6, 24 kHz and 37 kHz, see ﬁg. 10, we took
data with up to 4 s delay in the spectrum analyser, and found τ ≈ 1 s, 0.4 s and
0.1 s respectively.
The angular distributions for the amplitude of the 37 kHz, L=0 mode at the two

tion. The beam hits the sphere at upper: E, lower: A.

vertical beam positions E and A are shown in ﬁgures 11. The L=0 amplitude is
independent of the angle, and since the amplitude is constant to within 20% we
infer from the Fourier-modulus’ deviation from ﬂatness a 20% variation of the beam
intensity from one shot to another.
During our measurement with the sphere we were unable to use the beam pulse as
a trigger, implying that the start time of data acquisition with respect to the beam
pulse is unknown.
In our further analysis we will therefore use only the Fourier
modulus, and not analyse the phases.
The absolute scale of the 37 kHz Fourier amplitude turned out to be ≈ 5 times
larger than the model value for sensor-2 and ≈ 50 times for sensor-1. We assume
this discrepancy to be based on some interference eﬀects, possibly with a sensor
resonance and a suspension bar mode, and we do not further analyse the L=0

mode. To disentangle the angular distributions in general, we felt, would squeeze
the results of our simple measurement too much, for a couple of reasons. First, the
Fourier amplitude AL for any multi-pole order L in the sphere’s case is actually
a sum of M-submodes. Though they would be degenerate for an ideal sphere,
in practice some M-modes might or might not turn out to be split beyond the
frequency-resolution of ∆f =30 Hz. Second, both sensors s1, s2 should be taken to
have unknown sensitivities, esj, in three orthogonal directions, with phase factors
+1 or -1 for their orientation. Third, though each mode would start to be excited
within the same sub-nanosecond time interval of the beam crossing, the building up
of each mode’s resonance vibration may lead to a speciﬁc phase t0
ML,bk depending on
the mode’s spatial relation to the beam path.
We now show that the calculated angular distributions have the signature of the L-
character of the measurement. Therefore, we write the Fourier modulus at diﬀerent
impinging beam positions bk as a function of the angle φ as:

AL,sj,bk(φ) =| FL,sj,bk

ǫsj ·

+ML

X
−ML

sL,ML,bkuL,ML,sj,bk(φ)eωLt0

ML,bk |,

(10)

where FL,sj,bk is a frequency response function for each sensor, which may depend
also on the beam position. This normalisation factor is expected to be of order
1, and is kept ﬁxed at 1 for the L=2 distributions. It is used as a free parameter
for the L=1 distributions to compensate for the rather inaccurate knowledge of a)
the sensor positions on the sphere’s surface, b) the beam track location and c) the
electrons and photons shower development along the track, since the exact excitation
strengths of the modes are quite sensitive to such data. As the ﬁrst step in the ﬁtting
procedure we separately calculated the sL,ML,bkuL,ML,sj,bk, where sL,ML,bk is the mode’s
strength from the beam excitation, as detailed in the appendix. We inserted the
calculated sL,ML,bkuL,ML,sj,bk in a hierarchical ﬁtting model, to simultaneously ﬁt [16]
the relevant parameters of eq. 10 to the 17.6 kHz, L=2 Fourier modulus AL,sj,bk for
both sensors s1 and s2 at both beam positions E and A. This ﬁt led to a reduced
χ2=1.3 at 59 degrees of freedom. Next, with ﬁxed values for the sensor eﬃciencies
ǫsj so established, we ﬁtted the relevant parameters for the 24 kHz, L=1 Fourier
peaks, including the L=1 sensor response factors F . At all stages the | t0
ML,bk | of the
phases were kept within the bounds of the period of mode-L. With an uncertainty
in the beam charge and in the Fourier peak amplitudes of ≈ 20% each, the error
amounts to ≈30%, and we took a minimum absolute error of 2×10−5 for sensor s1
and 1×10−5 for sensor s2. In total we have 152 data points, while the total number
of ﬁtted parameters is 27, including a relative normalising factor for the mean beam
current at beam position A with respect to the mean current at beam position E.
We found for the total ﬁt a reduced χ2=1.6 at 125 degrees of freedom. The L=1
response factors remain within 1.1 and 0.2. The results of the ﬁts to the 17.6 kHz
and 24 kHz are given in ﬁgures 12 and 13 and table V. Note the diﬀerent vertical
scales used for sensor-1 and sensor-2 in both pictures. Some of the parameters given

We conclude that the measured Fourier amplitude angular distributions are con-

sistent with the model value for the L=2 and L=1 mode signature.

4.2.1 The sphere’s absolute displacement

Finally, to estimate the order of magnitude of the sphere’s absolute displacement,
we have to take an intermediate step by ﬁrst normalising bar BU to the calibrated
results for bar BC and then use bar BU as a calibration for the sphere. The sensors
used on bar BU consisting of the same sensor material and having been cut roughly
to the same size, we assume to be identical to the ones used on sphere SU. The
ampliﬁers used are identical. The bar BU sensors, however, diﬀer strongly from
those of bar BC.

We arrive at an indirectly calibrated value for ǫBU,2 = (3.4∗ 10−4 ± 30%) V/ms−2 of
sensor-2 on bar BU. The value of ǫBU,1 for sensor-1 is about ten times smaller.
Then, for the sphere, the ﬁtted value of ǫsj given in table V, shows the largest value
of sensor-2, ǫφ−SU = (4 ∗ 10−4 ± 10%) V/ms−2, to lead to a ratio ≈ (1.2 ± 0.4) with
ǫBU . Again, the values for sensor-1 are about ten times smaller. The error of ≈ 33%
is the propagated statistical error only. The result seems reasonable. So, the model
calculation and our sphere measurement results are of the same order of magnitude
on an absolute scale too.
From the maximum Fourier modulus, V max = (0.003 ± 0.001) V, of the 17.6 kHz,
L=2 sphere mode measured in sensor sensor-2 as given in ﬁg. 13, and the ab-
sorbed energy of 3.1 J, we ﬁnd the maximum sphere’s displacement to correspond
to (0.2 ± 0.1)nm/J.

5 Discussion

Having conﬁrmed the thermo-acoustic conversion model in the present experiment,
we discuss some points about extrapolating these results to the actual operation of
a resonant gravitational wave detector. Firstly, in our experiment many incident
particles deposited their energy in the resonator, in contrast to a single muon hit-
ting an actual detector. However, from this diﬀerence it seems unlikely to reach
diﬀerent conclusions, especially since in the process of depositing energy along its
track, the muon will generate lots of secondary particles too. Also, we measured at
room temperature while actual detectors would have to operate in the millikelvin
range. An aluminium resonator, for instance, at such a temperature, would be su-
perconducting, and it is as yet unclear how the decoupling of the electron gas from
the lattice would aﬀect the process of acoustic excitation.
Therefore, we hold it of particular importance for the prospected shielding of a next
generation resonant mass gravitational wave detector that an existing millikelvin
detector like the Nautilus [17, 18], would succeed in measuring the impinging cos-
mic rays in correlation with the resonator mode. Such a result, as a test for the
further applicability of the thermo-acoustic conversion model at operating temper-
ature, would come closest to the real situation envisaged for the new detectors.
Apart from such temperature eﬀects, the applicability of the thermal acoustic con-
version model [4, 5, 14] is conﬁrmed by the data and therefore cosmic rays should be
expected to seriously disrupt, as calculated by the model, the possibility of detecting
gravitational waves. It is beyond the scope of this article to go into any detail [19].
We want to point, however, to earlier calculations [3, 7, 20] which, having used the
model, clearly show, ﬁrstly, that a next generation spherical resonant mass gravita-
tional wave detector of ultra high sensitivity will be signiﬁcantly excited by cosmic
rays. Secondly, the high impact rate of cosmic rays will prohibit gravitational wave
detection at the earth’s surface, with the required sensitivity.

Finally, shielding the instrument by an appreciable layer of rock as available in, for
instance, the Gran Sasso laboratory, would suppress the cosmic ray background by
a factor of ≥ 106. Even then a vetoing system will be necessary and, at the radical
reduction of the background rate so established, it may indeed work eﬀectively.

Appendix: Sphere excitation model calculation

Our calculation of the (L, M)-mode excitation strengths is based on the source term
of eq. 5.10/11 of ref. [14], s = Σ/(ρV )∗R dz∇⊥· u, with Σ = γdE/dz. Here, γ is the
Grueneisen constant, ρV de sphere’s mass, and dE/dz the absorbed energy per unit
track length. The Fourier amplitudes, measuring the second time derivative of the
mode amplitudes, are directly proportional to s, and the mode amplitudes follow
from s/ω2, as in eq. 5.18 of [14]. However, the amount of energy absorbed per unit
length in our case depends on the particle’s position along the track. We therefore re-
included the Σ-term under the source term’s integral by letting dE(z)/dz represent
the electromagnetic cascade development of ref. [21] as an approximation to the
amount of energy absorbed per unit track length by the sphere at position z along
the beam track,

i=0 cizi. Then R zmax

where z is being measured from the beam’s entrance point into the sphere. With Eabs
being the total amount of energy absorbed by the sphere from the electron bunch,
we write dE(z)/dz = Eabs ∗ d(E(z)/Eabs)/dz and use the polynomial expansion
d(E(z)/Eabs)/dz = P3
zmin dzd(E(z)/Eabs)/dz=1. For the polynomial,
measuring z in meter, we acquired the values c0=0.8332 m−1, c1=226 m−2, c2=-
1832 m−3, c3=4909 m−4 from a ﬁt to the form given in ref.
[21], with less than a
percent deviation for our case of 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.15 m. The value for the energy absorbed
by the sphere from a single electron, Ee
abs=123 MeV, we got from both our Monte
Carlo simulation using GEANT [22], and from EGS4 [23, 24]. At the measured 25 nC
beam pulse charge this corresponds to a total Eabs = 3.1 J absorbed by the sphere.
Then the value of κ Eabs = γEabs/M=1.00 m2/s2, for our case of M = ρV =4.95
kg and γ=1.6. Our sphere has a suspension hole which leads to a slight shift in
the frequencies and the spatial distribution of the modes, with respect to those of a
sphere without a hole [25]. We approximated, however, our sphere’s modes by the
ideal hole-free sphere’s eigenmode solutions u(z) [26], using the available computer
code as established in ref. [27], and renormalising to R u·udV = V , as used in ref. [14]
from eq. 5.6 onward. The source term sL,ML was calculated for each mode (L, M)
by numerically integrating eq. 11. We checked the surface term in the numerical
procedure to be negligible, as assumed in the partial integration leading to the form
of s used by ref. [14]. Each u(φ) in eq. 10 is the eigenmode solution, calculated
for each sensor on the φ-grid of the measured data, and each term sL,ML,bk is the
excitation factor sL,ML at the speciﬁc beam position bk.

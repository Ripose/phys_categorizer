Energy ﬂow in a hadronic cascade:
Application to hadron calorimetry

Abstract

em =

The hadronic cascade description developed in an earlier paper is extended to
the response of an idealized ﬁne-sampling hadron calorimeter. Calorimeter response
is largely determined by the transfer of energy Ee from the hadronic to the elec-
tromagnetic sector via π0 production. Fluctuations in this quantity produce the
“constant term” in hadron calorimeter resolution. The increase of its fractional
mean, f 0
/E, with increasing incident energy E causes the energy de-

along with sampling ﬂuctuations, are incorporated to give an overall understanding
of resolution, which is diﬀerent from the usual treatments in interesting ways. The
conceptual framework is also extended to the response to jets and the diﬀerence
between π and p response.

In Paper I[1] we developed a conceptual basis for understanding the divi-

cylinder, with no energy leakage except via muons, neutrinos, and front-surface
albedo losses. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations gave results in good agree-
ment with test-beam measurements. The relevant conclusions of the paper
were that:

(1) All signiﬁcant hadronic energy deposition is by low-energy particles
(<
1 GeV), whose energy and species distribution in a given medium is
∼
independent of the energy or species of the incident hadron. (Hadronic
energy is deﬁned as all energy not carried away by π0 decay photons. 2 )
The existence of this “universal low-energy hadron spectrum” makes it
possible to deﬁne an energy-independent eﬃciency h for the conversion
of this energy into a visible signal in a ﬁne-sampling calorimeter.

(2) In each high-energy collision of the hadronic cascade, a signiﬁcant fraction
(typically 1/4) of the energy is transferred to the electromagnetic (em)
sector via π0 production. A sequence of high-energy hadronic collisions
bleeds oﬀ a larger and larger fraction of the energy as the incident energy
E increases. The net fraction transferred to the em sector is fem, and the
mean em fraction is f 0

2 Assigning nuclear gamma ray energy to the hadronic sector is an awkward but

multiple pion production becomes signiﬁcant.

(4) It was predicted that a calorimeter would have a diﬀerent response to a

proton than to an electron.

The observations pertain equally well to a homogeneous or ﬁne-sampling
calorimeter, and have signiﬁcant implications for its response and resolution.
“Fine-sampling” means that absorber and sensor elements are thin compared
to both the em radiation length and the neutron interaction length. It has the
same structure throughout: no separate em compartment or rear catcher. It
can be an inorganic crystal calorimeter, a uranium/liquid argon calorimeter,
or a lead/scintillator-ﬁber calorimeter.

The power-law approximation given in Eq. (1) is just that, for reasons dis-
cussed in Paper I . It seems to work well over the energy range of available
test-beam data, about 10 GeV to 375 GeV, and it has the required asymptotic
properties: It is everywhere positive, and f 0
. The
physical assumptions it is based upon become less dependable at very high
energies and are not valid at energies below the threshold for multiple pion
production.

As far as possible, results in this paper are obtained without recourse the
the powerlaw approximation for f 0
h, to obtain more general results than those
relying on this more approximate form.

Most of the results reported in this paper were ﬁrst reported at a variety
of calorimetry conferences and appear in the various Proceedings[2,4–9]. The
Monte Carlo results used in these papers are often based on now-superseded
versions of hadronic cascade simulation codes[10], the oldest being FLUKA86.
In particular, nuclear gamma rays were not included, so that the em deposit is
exclusively via π0 production. Since these versions many improvements in the
codes have been made, e.g., improvements in FLUKA by Ferrari and Sala[11],
especially in the nuclear physics modeling. The failings of the old code are
apparent in Fig. 2(b), for example, where the points fall below the 45◦ line
because of unscored hadronic energy. A large fraction of the unscored energy
is evidently that of nuclear gamma rays. On the other hand, electromagnetic
energy deposition was very well described[12] and can be trusted. In Paper I
we reported simulations with MARS10, HETC, and FLUKA, which, though
based on diﬀerent high-energy interaction models, were in excellent agreement.
Since in this paper I depend only upon the high-energy division between the
em and hadronic sectors, calculations based on the older code have not been
repeated.

Recent developments are incorporated, some of which were predicted or dis-
cussed in Paper I. These include Cherenkov readout[13], which is for the most

part sensitive only to the em energy deposition, and observation of the π/p
response diﬀerence[14].

Central to the paper is the discussion of resolution, where conditional proba-
bility distributions (p.d.f.’s) are combined to account for parallel, independent
stochastic processes.

Hadron calorimetry is a well-traveled road, explored in hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of papers over several decades. The object here is to present a broad-
brush treatment of hadronic cascades in a simpliﬁed generic calorimeter, in
hopes that a somewhat nonstandard approach can contribute to our physical
understanding of a real calorimeter. Real calorimeters, with front em compart-
ments, rear catchers, leakage, crack corrections, jet ﬁnding algorithms, and a
myriad of other problems, are described in dozens of test-beam study results,
as well as in published studies of compensation, the role of neutrons, and other
matters. These are discussed in detail in Wigmans’ book[3] and review[16] ,
the review by Leroy and Rancoita[17], and in their many citations. None of
these practical problems are discussed here.

2 Albedo and fem

The em fraction fem = Ee/E increases with energy, but at any given energy
it is subject to large ﬂuctuations. FLUKA simulations of the em/hadronic
energy division are shown in Fig. 2. The model absorber consisted of a large
lead cylinder (50 cm radius, 250 cm long) in which the ﬁrst 25 cm (about 1.5
interaction lengths) was treated as a separate region. In Fig 2(a) no distinction
is made between the regions, while in 2(b) interaction of the incident pion was

not permitted in the front section, but energy deposited there is included. It
acted as a catcher for back-scattered interaction debris. The distribution about
the ideal Eh = 1
Eem shows less scatter in 2(b) because front-face, or albedo,
losses are included. Most albedo loss comes from backward or backscattered
products of the ﬁrst collision; when the ﬁrst interaction occurs deep in the
detector there is essentially no albedo loss. Runs at 50 GeV with and without
an “albedo catcher” show an average diﬀerence in deposited energy is 0.43
GeV, or 0.8%. Out of 1000 cascades 50% lost less than 0.2 GeV, and 3.4% lost
more than 2 GeV. In the simulations the amount of lost albedo energy rises
only slowly with increasing incident energy, as might be expected. While these
losses are not totally negligible, I omit them from resolution consideration in
Sec, 7 because (a) the distribution is sharply peaked at near-zero loss, and (b)
the losses are small, particularly at higher energies.

For reasons discussed in the introduction, the points shown in Fig. 2 scatter
below the 45◦ line because older versions of FLUKA did not account for all of
the hadronic energy deposit, even in the absence of albedo losses. Presumably
most of this downward scatter (about 15% in the worst case) is the result of
the program’s failure to tally nuclear gamma rays, mostly the result of slow
neutron capture by nuclei. According to Ferrari and Sala[18], these might
account for nearly 10% (Fe) or 20% (Pb) of the π0 + γ fraction, or 5%–10% of
the total energy deposit. This energy fraction is not counted as part of what I
call visible em deposit, since the it scales with the hadronic fraction, not the
π0 fraction. Given that the hadronic fraction is underestimated, it is better to
take the hadronic fraction as

As the number of Monte Carlo events in the sample increases, the (Eh, Ee)
distribution projected onto the Ee axis approaches the marginal distribution
Π(Ee), the p.d.f for the em energy. Two FLUKA-generated (unnormalized) ex-
amples of Ee/E distributions are shown in Fig. 3(a). The mean and standard

The rms width of Ee/E distribution, σnc, is remarkably constant, with only
a 40% decrease over two orders of magnitude in energy. This likely occurs
because of the slow logarithmic growth of multiplicity. The dimensionless “co-
eﬃcient of skewness,” γ1 = µ3/(σ3
ncE3) (where µ3 is the third moment about
the mean), is constant to within the Monte Carlo statistics with a value near
0.6. There are no signiﬁcant higher moments within the sensitivity of the
simulations.

It is to be expected that diﬀerent or better cascade simulations would result
in a somewhat diﬀerent shape and diﬀerent moments. What is of consequence
here is that a function Π(Eem) exists which describes the energy distribution

It is possible to understand the contribution of Π(Eem) to the calorimeter res-
olution by a geometrical construction. Figure 4 shows the same MC “events”
as Fig. 2(b), but with the lost hadronic energy restored as per Eq. (2) (except
for some vertical scatter retained for clarity). The observed energy distribution
in the absence of sampling ﬂuctuations is the projection of this distribution

3 π/e

An electromagnetic shower initiated by an electron or π0-decay photons pro-
duces a visible signal (potentially observable via ionization or Cherenkov light)
in a calorimeter with eﬃciency e. Most of the ionization is by electrons and
positrons with energies below the critical energy, of order 10 MeV (21.8 MeV
for iron, 7.0 MeV for uranium). The response, here temporarily called “e,” is
usually linear in the incident energy E, and so serves to calibrate the energy
scale:

“e” = e E

(3)

As shown in Paper I, the visible signal produced by hadron interactions also
comes predominately from low-energy ionizing particles whose spectra and rel-
ative abundance are independent of the incident hadron energy. Many mech-
anisms are at play, including endothermic nuclear spallation. Neutrons play
an especially signiﬁcant role[15]. These mechanisms are exhaustively treated
in the literature; for example, in Refs. [3,16–18]. The sum of all the hadronic

of the copper/quartz-ﬁber calorimeter, an additional ﬁt (dotted line) is made

In Paper I we observed that f 0
is larger for an incident charged
pion than for an incident proton (or neutron). This is a consequence of the fact
that a leading hadron, carrying a large fraction of the energy, is likely to have
the same quark number as the incident hadron. If the collision is instigated
by a π±, there is high probability that the leading hadron is a π0, but for an
incident proton or neutron the leading hadron is most likely a baryon. The
mean em fraction f 0
em is thus larger for an incident pion than for an incident
baryon.

We also observed that for a given material or ﬁne-sampling calorimeter, there
is an energy-independent spectrum of hadrons below the incident hadron’s
energy, and that most energy deposit is by very low-energy particles. This

Thus if h/e
= 1, a calorimeter should give a diﬀerent response for charged
pions than for protons. In the usual case, where h/e < 1, pions give the
larger response. The eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 7, where as an example we
use h/e = 0.67, obtained from CALOR simulations (Paper I, Table 1) for the
“iron” conﬁguration of the SDC test-beam calorimeter[24]. It is regrettable
that there was not time to measure the eﬀect there.

Since then, the CMS forward calorimeter group at CERN has measured the
π/p diﬀerence using a calorimeter consisting of quartz ﬁbers embedded in a
copper matrix[13,14]. In this calorimeter, Cherenkov light was detected, most
of it coming from em showers, so that h/e was very small, and the π–p response

As indicated above and in Fig. 1, e and h are the eﬃciencies with which
electromagnetic and hadronic energy are converted into a visible signal. It is
conventional to scale signal sizes, in ADC counts, to the mean response for
minimum ionizing particles (mips), thus giving them something of an absolute
meaning. In practice the “average” signal from penetrating muons, corrected
for radiative losses, is assumed to be described by the Bethe-Bloch equation
including the density eﬀect. 7 It is then scaled to the value at minimum ion-
ization, presumably deﬁning the mip.

But the mip is commonly used incorrectly.

In a simpliﬁcation of the normal derivation of the Bethe-Bloch formula, 8 ion-
ization and excitation energy losses are calculated separately for (soft) distant

6 This ratio was not calculated in Refs. [13] or [14].
7 In everyday detectors, energy loss by escaping δ-rays or gain from entering δ-
rays is small (2% level), so that “energy loss” and “energy deposit” can be used
somewhat interchangeably.
8 Fano [25] introduces an intermediate energy transfer region.

collisions (low energy transfer per interaction) and (hard) near collisions (high
energy transfer). The regions are distinguished by the approximations appro-
priate to each[25–27]. One hopes for an energy at which they meet; this can
sometimes be a problem in high-Z materials. Each contributes a factor ln βγ
to the behavior at high energies:

(1) As the particle becomes more relativistic, its electric ﬁeld ﬂattens and
becomes more extended. This extension is limited by polarization of the
material. This “density eﬀect” asymptotically removes the ln βγ factor
contributed by the distant-collision region. The “relativistic rise” is still
there, but with half the slope[28]. 9

(2) The kinematic maximum energy Tmax which can be transferred in one
collision sets the upper limit for hard energy transfer. Its rise with energy
is responsible for the other ln βγ factor. As the particle energy increases
there is more δ-ray production and the “Landau tail” grows and extends.
The most probable energy loss, in a region well below minimum ionization
that is dominated by many soft collisions, shows little or no relativistic
rise and approaches a “Fermi plateau.” This is more easily understood
for the related restricted mean energy loss discussed below.

The δ rays are part of energy loss as described by the Bethe-Bloch equa-
tion, and must not be confused with the density-eﬀect correction δ(βγ)
or the muon radiative processes discussed below.

For detectors of moderate thickness x (e.g. the scintillator tiles or LAr cells
used in calorimeters), 10 the energy loss probability distribution f (∆; βγ, x)
is adequately described by the skewed Landau (or Landau-Vavilov-Bichsel)
distribution[29–31]. The most probable energy loss is

The conclusion is that the mean of the energy loss given by the Bethe-Bloch
equation is ill-deﬁned experimentally and is not useful for describing energy
loss by single particles. (It probably ﬁnds its best application in dosimetry,
where only bulk deposit is of relevance.) It rises with energy because Tmax
increases. The large single-collision energy transfers that increasingly extend
the long tail are rare. For a β
1 particle, for example, on average only
one collision with T > 1 keV will occur along a path length of 90 cm of Ar
gas[34]. The energy loss distribution for a 10 GeV muon traversing a 1.7 mm
silicon detector, shown in Fig. 10, further illustrates the point. Here about

Boundary-crossing δ rays are (accurately) assumed not to be important. Here
S is the active region thickness, dE/dx
|scint is the energy loss rate in the active
region (scintillator or other), A is the absorber thickness, and dE/dx
|abs is the
energy loss rate in the absorber. It is “fairly sampled” if this is the case. This
is not the case for electron and muon radiative losses.

Relativistic muons also lose energy radiatively by direct pair production,
bremsstrahlung, and photonuclear interactions. In iron at 1 TeV, these loss
rates are in the ratios 0.58:0.39:0.03. The ratios are fairly insensitive to energy
at energies where the radiation contribution is important. The pair:brems-
strahlung ratio is about the same from material to material, while the pho-

tonuclear fraction grows with atomic number. These contributions to dE/dx
rise almost linearly with energy, becoming as important as ionization losses at
some “muon critical energy” Eµc: 1183 GeV in plastic scintillator, 347 GeV in
iron and 141 GeV in lead. 12

The tables of Lohmann et al.[36] are commonly used. More extensive tables
with a somewhat improved treatment of radiative losses are given by Groom
et al.[27], and an extension to nearly 300 materials is available on the Particle
Data Group web pages[37]. 13

The muons are accompanied by an entourage of photons and electrons (cascade
products from direct pair production and bremsstrahlung) characteristic of
radiative losses in the higher-Z absorber. When a “naked” muon enters a
calorimeter, the entourage gradually increases until it reaches a saturation
value. In principle these radiative products should be detected with the same
eﬃciency as electrons, although a few high-energy pairs go through the active
layers. There is little radiative loss in the low-Z active layers themselves.

The bremsstrahlung is suﬃciently continuous as to not introduce signiﬁcant
radiation ﬂuctuations[38], but there are large ﬂuctuations in the pair produc-
tion energy loss. Monte Carlo calculations by Striganov and collaborators[39]
indicate that, while a high-energy shoulder appears on the energy-loss dis-
tribution, the most probable energy loss increases only slightly in “thin” ab-
sorbers,” e. g. for 1000 GeV muons incident on 100 g cm−2 of iron. He regards
radiative eﬀects as “important” when the most probable height of the nor-
malized energy-loss distributions are lowered by >
10% when radiative eﬀects
∼
are included. This is the case for real calorimeters (more than 1000 g cm−2)
at the highest muon calibration energies normally used. Although the most
probable energy loss is still the best calibration metric, it does rise somewhat
with beam energy.

The calibration of the HELIOS modules (uranium/scintillator sandwiches) is
particularly well described[40]. The common normalization of individual lay-
ers was done via radioactive decay in the uranium plates, so the distributions
shown are for entire modules. In correcting for the radiative losses they as-
sumed fair sampling by the scintillator. Their correction of energy deposit for

12 Other charged particles experience radiative losses as well, but there is no easy
mass scaling for the radiative loss rate. In a calorimeter incident pions lose energy
by radiation until they interact, but the higher loss rate is of little consequence and
in any case the radiated energy is absorbed.
13 For the PDG tables, an improvement to the pair-production cross section was
made which slightly changes the muon dE/dx at high energies in high-Z materials.
In both cases the ionization losses include a correction for muon brehmsstrahlung
on atomic electrons, so that at high energies the table entries slightly exceed the
Bethe-Block values.

17

radiative eﬀects is straightforward, but the robustness of the “average” energy
deposit is unclear.

Muon detection in SPACAL (scintillator ﬁbers in a lead matrix) is carefully
described by Acosta et al[41]. The energy dependence of the most probable
values is shown. The distributions clearly show both the radiative broadening
and the increase of the most probable values due to radiative eﬀects.

If the calibration muon beam has been momentum-selected and then travels
through air or vacuum to the calorimeter, it enters “naked,” without its en-
tourage of pairs and bremsstrahlung photons and, until this builds up over
several radiation lengths, the signal distribution does not include the full radi-
ation contribution. If the equilibrium contribution is desired, absorber should
be placed in the beam. However, in the HELIOS and SPACAL cases, the
calorimeters as a whole were calibrated. Since these are many radiation lengths
thick, the lower deposit at the beginning should not sensibly aﬀect the result.

All of this assumes muons of known energy. “Out of channel” muons, which
have gone through or around the test-beam optics, are certainly not depend-
able calibration particles, but are sometimes used[24]. Cosmic ray muons have
a characteristic energy of about 3 GeV, but the ﬂux falls oﬀ as about cos2 θ,
where θ is the zenith angle [RPP06, Sec. 24]. They can provide a useful if
imprecise calibration in some situations.

6 e, h, and e/h

≈

Given a credible muon calibration, the quantity e/mip can be measured in an
electron beam. In a sampling calorimeter, cascade electrons are predominately
produced and absorbed in the inactive higher-Z material, so the signal is
signiﬁcantly smaller than might be expected from the active layer’s share of
dE/dx (e/mip
0.6 to 0.7[42]), but with the uncertainties associated with
most probable energy deposit vs average energy deposit. It can be “tuned”
by changing the absorber/detector ratio, perhaps to achieve compensation
(h/e = 1). Other things being equal, the detection eﬃciency is smaller if the
absorber has a higher Z. The critical energy is lower, so characteristic shower
electrons are more likely to deposit their energy before leaving the absorber.
As a corollary, e/mip = 1 for a nonsegmented calorimeter (e.g. an inorganic
crystal), and since there is always missing hadronic energy such a calorimeter
is always noncompensating.

The hadron eﬃciency h is more problematical; one ﬁnds a = (1
or
an equivalent by ﬁtting the energy dependence of π/e, and assumptions must
always be made about the constant multiplier to ﬁnd h/e and hence h/mip.

is close to 1 for incident pions, but it is about 20% higher

h is considerably more diﬃcult to model, but in general it is smaller than e
because of the wide variety of ways hadronic energy becomes invisible, e.g.
through nuclear binding energy losses and “late” energy deposition (outside
the electronics window). 14 It increases somewhat with Z, and can be enhanced
by neutron production in uranium. Calorimeters with more “Z-contrast” are
more compensating (e
h) mostly because e is smaller, in spite of the em-
phasis in the literature on increasing h.

≈

Can we measure h/mip directly? Only by observing hadronic cascades in a
calorimeter insensitive to π0-produced em cascades, or by observing cascades
produced by hadrons below the π0 threshold. In Paper I we speculated about
building a calorimeter sensitive only to hadrons (a neutron detector) or to
the em sector (a calorimeter sensitive only to Cherenkov radiation), but the
context of the discussion was veriﬁcation of the power approximation for f 0
h
and determination of the power m.

In the spirit of only- (mostly-) em sensitivity in the copper/quartz-ﬁber CMS
test calorimeter, Demianov et al.[43] made preliminary neutron measurements
using Bonner spheres[44] adjacent to the copper/quartz-ﬁber calorimeter[13].
The longitudinal and transverse distributions were measured. The results were
in fair to good agreement with MARS’96[45] calculations, but not suﬃciently
detailed to obtain h/mip (or n/mip). Preliminary proposals[46] (in connection
with International Linear Collider (ILC) detector R&D) are being made to
measure the neutron ﬂux by a variety of methods; future test-beam results
will be of great interest.

One might use hadrons with energies below the π0 threshold. The ZEUS col-
laboration made measurements with low-energy protons and charged pions
with a compensated U/scintillator calorimeter[47]. Interestingly, as the kinetic
energy of the beam was decreased from about 5 GeV to about 0.4 GeV, e/h de-
creased from its high-energy value (one) to the e/mip measured for electrons.
The lower-energy particles tended to lose much or all of their energy by ioniza-
tion, so that they became indistinguishable from electrons at suﬃciently low
energies. The resolution also decreased from its hadronic value, approaching
the em resolution until at the lowest energies noise became dominant.

A more desirable (or complimentary) approach might be to use an incident
2.6 GeV, one might expect the
beam of low-energy neutrons. Since E0p ≈
π0 threshold to be about T
1.6 GeV. As the energy is scanned downward,
a pure hadronic signal should emerge. The response would not be quite the
hadronic signal observed from a higher-energy cascade, but this diﬀerence can

probably be understood. At very least, measurements in a low-energy neutron
beam would be interesting. But the real problem is making the test beam.

7 Resolution

The arrows between boxes in Fig. 1 actually indicate the various probability
distribution functions (p.d.f.’s) describing ﬂuctuations in each of the steps. A
more complete version, Fig. 11, deﬁnes these distributions, which are described
in more detail in Table A.1. In the simple model considered in this paper, ﬁve
p.d.f.’s appear.

The potentially detectable energy deposit, or visible energy, is labeled “vis.”
It usually means ionization, which sometimes sampled directly but more often
via scintillators, where the scintillation light is usually detected by photo-
multipliers. In rare cases Cherenkov light is sampled. The variance associated
with the visible energy distribution distribution at ﬁxed Ee, dominated by
ﬂuctuations in the total kinetic energy of neutrons, is the intrinsic variance.

The label “samp” refers to the additional ﬂuctuations introduced in sampling
the visible energy by a readout transducer such as a photomultiplier.

The stochastic processes are deﬁned as follows:

(1) In the cascade initiated by the incident hadron, energy Ee is transferred
to the em sector via π0 production and decay. Because of its diﬀerent
energy dependence, em energy deposited by nuclear gamma rays is not
included in my deﬁnition of Ee. The p.d.f. Π(Ee) was introduced in Sec. 2
to describe its distribution.

ionization produced mostly by low-energy (“terminal”) electrons and
positrons. The p.d.f. of the em visible energy deposit at ﬁxed Ee is labeled

(3) Quite independently, the hadronic component produces a visible signal
via energy loss by charged secondaries. This signal, the result of a variety
of mechanisms, is produced with an overall average eﬃciency h. The vis-
ible contribution by nuclear gamma rays is included here. Again, most of
the ionization is by low-energy particles. The p.d.f. gh(Evis

ther directly or by observing scintillation light (Cherenkov light) with
photomultipliers or photodiodes. This step is to an extent under the con-
trol of the experimenter, since it depends on scintillation eﬃciency, light
collection eﬃciency, and other design details. For ﬁxed Evis one measures
a signal Esamp, chosen from a distribution Fsamp(Esamp
Evis), which is
then summed over the intermediate Evis to obtain the ﬁnal distribution
of the signal, Esamp. Even this step is not a simple convolution, since the
variance of Fsamp(Esamp

Evis) is proportional to Evis, not E.

The intrinsic and sampling distributions were separated in a classic experi-
ment by Drews et al.[48], who used two compensating sandwich calorimeters
with scintillator readout with lead and uranium plates, respectively. Alternate
sets of scintillators were read out separately. Sampling variations in the two
sets were independent, while intrinsic ﬂuctuations were correlated. These were
recovered by adding and subtracting variances.

Calculation of the combined distribution is tedious and not entirely obvious;
it is relegated to Appendix A. The result (repeating Eq. (A.21)) is

The ﬁrst term is the familiar sampling contribution, (C/√E)2, except that it is
multiplied by π/e. This is to be expected and required, since this contribution
to the variance is proportional to the sampled visible signal, with mean (π/e)E,
rather than to the incident energy E.

The two terms in the square brackets are the two pieces of the intrinsic vari-
ance. Even if h/e = 1, the intrinsic variance has some energy dependence,

Wigmans[3] has noted that σintr/√E for the simulated lead/LAr calorime-
ter described in his Table 3.4 decreases with energy, reﬂecting the gradually
increasing transfer of energy to the em sector. His calculated results for six
energies, given in his Table 4.3, are plotted in Fig. 12. The curve was obtained
by adjusting the intrinsic variance scales σ2
h0. The best-ﬁt parameters
are σe0 = 5.1% and σh0 = 13.7%. The ﬁt is remarkably good, and, as expected,
σh0 is considerably larger than σe0.

e0 and σ2

The last term is the expected “constant term,” nearly (but not quite) constant
because the fractional variance of Π(Ee), σ2
nc, is nearly energy independent,
as discussed in Sec. 2. Here I treat it as a constant. It has larger values in
calorimeters with higher-Z absorber.

The em part of the intrinsic variance increases in importance as E increases,
as does the sampling variance. Both curve downward if plotted vs 1/E, as
shown in Fig. 13. Since the hadronic intrinsic contribution decreases faster
than 1/E, it curves upward.

It is diﬃcult to verify Eq. (12), even with robust experimental data. The
expected resolution should be a linear combination of the three curves shown
in Fig. 13 (plus a constant term), so any deviation of the variance from the
traditional C 2
1 /E will show up as a slight curvature. Moreover, the sampling
and em contributions have such similar energy dependence that a simultaneous
ﬁt to σsamp0 and σe0 can be indeterminate.

Parameters for both cases are shown in Table 3. The ﬁttted values for σe0 and

8 Jets

How is calorimeter’s response to a jet diﬀerent than its response to a single
pion? There are three situations to consider:

(1) An incident pion. The primary collision usually occurs about an inter-
action length into the calorimeter. There is a minimum of backscatter
(“albedo”). The fragmentation process is dependent on energy and the
nuclear environment.

(2) A “test-beam jet,” in which trigger counters ensure that the primary
interaction occurs in a thin absorber in front of the calorimeter. This is
exactly the same as the incident pion case, except for increased albedo
because of the high probability that some of the ﬁrst-collision debris
interacts near the front of the calorimeter.

(3) A primary fragmentation jet. The only evident diﬀerences from the above
cases are the (much) higher energies and a simpler environment; except
in heavy-ion collisions just two particles interact. This section concerns

24

whether the mix and distribution of photons, pions, and other particles
results in calorimeter response diﬀerent than the response to a pion or
“test-beam jet.”

As elsewhere in this paper, the situation is highly idealized: The homogenous
or ﬁne-sampling calorimeter is large enough to contain the entire cascade and
the structure is uniform throughout. The realities of jet-ﬁnding and isolation
algorithms, albedo, the eﬀects of the magnetic ﬁeld, passive material in front
of the calorimeter, etc., are all ignored.

The power law approximation for fh developed in Paper I will be used through-
out this section.

A jet with energy EJ consists of photons, mostly from π0 decay, and “stable”
hadrons. (Energy which might be carried away by leptons is ignored.) Since
most of the incident “stable” hadron ﬂux consists of charged pions, E0 ≈
1 GeV and (1

One needs only to sum the calorimeter response to all of these particles to
obtain the response to a jet. If Rej is the response to the jth π0 (γ) in the
jet (with energy Eπ0j) and Rhk the response to the kth stable hadron (with
energy Ehk), then the response to a jet is given by

Alternatively, the spectrum of stable hadrons can be described by a fragmen-

The sum (Eqn. 14) or integral (Eqn. 15) thus appears as a correction factor
to the normal hadronic response of a calorimeter. If it is unity, the response

25

to a jet is the same as the response to a pion. In any case it is multiplied
by a, which is usually < 0.3. The distinction between a single pion and a jet
vanishes as the calorimeter becomes more compensated—except, of course, for
the albedo, magnetic ﬁeld, passive material in front of the calorimeter, and
cone-cut eﬀects mentioned above.

If the sum or integral is evaluated for m = 0, the mean stable hadron multi-
is obtained. If m = 1, the result is the mean nonelectromagnetic

fraction of the jet’s energy
. The desired summation or integral, with

The published fragmentation function is for the entire event, so the func-
tion has been normalized downward by a factor of two to describe the
individual jets. Data were read from their Fig. 3(b) and extrapolated to
z = 0.

and 1.15 before normalization, and 0.92 to 1.06 after normalization—probably
well within the uncertainty of the fragmentation functions in either the exper-
imental or Monte Carlo cases. The integrals also change by about 0.05 if m
is changed by 0.01, introducing an additional uncertainty which could be as
great as 20%. Given the various uncertainties, I conclude that the correction
factor for fragmentation jets at the highest-energy colliders should be between
0.85 and 1.15.

The compensation factor a

further reduce the eﬀect of the correction factor in producing a jet/π diﬀer-

in Fig. 16 for calorimeters with h/e = 0.70 and h/e = 0.85, values which might
occur for a Pb/LAr or badly designed metal/scintillator calorimeter. The un-
certainty in the exponent m could introduce an error of about 3% for jets
below 100 GeV in a poor calorimeter.

In summary: In the context of a power law approximation to the hadronic
fraction for an incident pion, the response for an incident jet reduces to a
simple correction factor, an integral over the fragmentation function. Given

9 Beating the devil

An estimation of the em content of individual events would permit correction
for intrinsic ﬂuctuations (reduction of the “constant term”), along with its
contribution to energy uncertainty.

Several attempts have been made to use the radial and longitudinal detail
to estimate, and correct for, the em cascades. During tests for the SDC con-
struction, it was proposed that the em contribution might come “early” in

28

the cascade, and could be estimated by excess energy deposit in the ﬁrst lay-
ers. This turned out not to be true[52]. The ATLAS barrel calorimeter group
adjusts downward the contribution of readout cells with large signals, since
these tended to be from em cascades. In the test-beam runs they achieved
2.2)%/√E[53].
slight improvements, e.g. from (46.9
±
Ferrari and Sala have simulated such corrections for the LAr TPC ICARUS
detector, where very detailed 3D imaging is possible, and conclude that the
em content can be fairly well determined from the direct observation of the em
cascades[18]. The success of these corrections depends on the detail available,
and any gains are usually marginal.

1.2)%/√E to (45.2

±

It was long suggested by Mockett[54] that information from a dual-readout
calorimeter with diﬀerent h/e’s in the two channels could be used to estimate
the electromagnetic fraction fem for each event. Winn[55] has proposed using
“orange” scintillator, observing the ionization contribution through an orange
ﬁlter and observing the Cherenkov contribution through a blue ﬁlter. This has
not yet been implemented, and looks problematical.

The idea of using a quartz ﬁber/scintillator ﬁber dual readout calorimeter
to extract an estimate of Ee for each event was discussed by Wigmans in
1997[56]. Since then, the DREAM collaboration (Akchurin et al.[57]) has ele-
gantly demonstrated the eﬃcacy of the dual-readout technique, using a cop-
per/optical ﬁber test-beam calorimeter. It consists of copper tubes, each con-
taining three plastic scintillator ﬁbers and four undoped ﬁbers which produce
only Cherenkov light. These are read out separately for each event.

The principle is illustrated in Fig. 17. Akchurin et al.’s notation is used: S
for the scintillator signal and Q for the Cherenkov signal, with both energy
scales calibrated with electrons. For this example their values h/e
|S = 0.7
and h/e
|Q = 0.2 are used for the scintillator and nominal Cherenkov readouts
respectively. For inﬁnitely good resolution. events with diﬀerent fem should lie
along the solid line drawn from fh = 1 to fh = 0 (fem = 0 to fem = 1):

S = E(fem + fh(h/e

|S)) , and Q = E(fem + fh(h/e

|Q)) .

(16)

The eﬀects of ﬁnite resolution are illustrated using simulations which give
fem for 100 GeV negative pions axially incident on a very large lead cylin-
der. (Results at 30 GeV from the same study are shown in Fig. 3(a).) For
this cartoon example I arbitrarily introduced a Gaussian scatter in both Eem
(σem/√100 GeV = 1.5%) and Eh (σh/√100 GeV = 3.0%). The “events” are
shown by the small +’s in the ﬁgure. The solid histogram at the top shows
the marginal distribution in S. The mean is 84.7 GeV, the fractional standard
deviation is 5.3%, and there is the usual skewness toward high energies.

The circles in Fig. 17 show the same events after reduction via Eq. (18), and

the fractional standard deviation is 3.4%, and there is no evident skewness.
Complete compensation has been achieved by using the simultaneous readouts.

Alternatively, a coordinate rotation to axes (Q′, S′) can be made, such that
the new Q′ axis is parallel to the event locus. The projection of the event
distribution onto the new S′ axis is of minimal width. Scaled upward by the

30

geometrical factor, it becomes the corrected distribution given by Eq. (18).

The importance of a large “compensation asymmetry” is evident. If the stan-

If neutron detection can be added to the DREAM concept, then the in-
principle ultimate 1% hadron calorimeter resolution[56] might be approached.

Alternate schemes simpler than DREAM would be desirable. Winn’s scheme[55],
taking advantage of the diﬀerent colors of Cherenkov and (red) scintillation
light, uses common detectors but still needs the doubled number of photomul-
tipliers. Clean separation of the two signals would likely be diﬃcult. LSND[58]
used a weak scintillator and distinguished between directional Cherenkov light
and isotropic scintillation light. But this was a very diﬀerent kind of detector,
a homogenous low-Z detector used in a search for rare signals involving single,
low-energy electrons. The electrons at the end of a high-energy shower do not
remember the original direction.

A variety of DREAM’s descendants are being studied under the rubric of the
”Fourth Concept Detector” for the International Linear Collider[59]. Improved
geometries are suggested (friendlier to the shapes of practical calorimeters),
and the all-important neutron detection issue is exploreded. Pulse-shape in-
formation (early Cherenkov light from electrons, later scintillation light from
charged hadrons, and perhaps even later scintillation light from neutron in-
teraction) might be exploited as an alternative to dual readout. n-p scattering
might be exploited in organic scintillator ﬁbers, with the “third rail” being
non-hydrogenous scintillator ﬁbers.

Another interesting possibility was presented by Zhao at a March, 2006 ILC
workshop[60]. A “conventional” iron/scintillator-plate sandwich calorimeter is
constructed in which lead glass tiles are substituted for all or part of the iron
plates. The Cherenkov light is detected via waveshifter ﬁbers in grooves in the
tiles. Since lead glass (heavy ﬂint glass) with speciﬁc gravities up to about 5.7

31

are available, the calorimeter thickness might not be that excessive.

10 Discussion

The conceptual picture of the physics of a hadronic cascade and the scaling
law it implies have been rich in consequences for understanding the behavior
of a hadron calorimeter. The response ratio π/e is particularly simple, and the
pion-proton response diﬀerence, in retrospect so obvious, was an unexpected
surprise. If the incident hadron is a jet rather than a pion, the response is
still given by Eq. (4), except that fh is multiplied by an integral over the
fragmentation function which appears to be near unity. Resolution is described
by considering in detail the various stochastic processes involved in a hadronic
cascade. They cannot be simply convoluted.

A Resolution

In the cascade initiated by a hadron with energy E, energy Ee is transferred to
the em sector via π0 production and decay. The energy deposit in the resulting
em cascades produce ionization with some eﬃciency e. Most of the ionization
is via energy loss by the abundant low-energy electrons. In the case of the CMS
developmental Cu/quartz-ﬁber test calorimeter[13], Cherenkov light samples
the electron path length. Quite independently, the hadronic component pro-
duces ionization through the many mechanisms involved in hadronic cascades,
again mostly by ionization by low-energy particles, with overall eﬃciency h.
Each goes its stochastic way independently of the other. One must calcu-
late the distribution of the sum of the contributions to the ionization with

the constraint that Ee is ﬁxed, then integrate over Ee. Finally, the distribu-
tion is “sampled” by directly collection ions or detecting scintillation light (or

ity distribution function (p.d.f.) has a variance somewhat diﬀerent than the
usual (σ/E) = σ′/√E

understood physically.

To expedite the calculations, it is useful to associate a characteristic function
eiux
= φ(u) (c.f.) with each p.d.f. f (x). It is essentially the Fourier transform
h
of the p.d.f., and is discussed in the Probability section of RPP06[28] and many
other places[61]. Among the properties I will use are:

Convolution of p.d.f.’s becomes multiplication of c.f.’s:

Here µ3 is the third moment of the distribution about the mean. The di-
mensionless “coeﬃcient of skewness” γ1 = µ3/σ3 was introduced in Sec. 2
and will be used here.

The arrows between boxes in Fig. (1) actually indicate the various probability
distribution functions (p.d.f.’s) describing ﬂuctuations in each of the steps.
A more complete version, Fig. 11, deﬁnes these distributions, which, along
with their c.f.’s, means, and variances are given in Table A.1. The notation
is somewhat verbose in the interest of clarity. Throughout the calculations,
the primary hadron energy E is implicit and constant. It is also convenient to
somewhat interchangeably use fe = Ee/E, Eh = (E

Ee), and fh = Eh/E.

The p.d.f. Π(Ee) is discussed in Sec. 2. For reasons discussed there, Ec (or fem)

ionization, which can be sampled by an appropriate transducer. Its mean value

the em response[23,40,62]. It is thus expected that σ2

The ﬁnal step is to “sample” the ionization with whatever output transducer
is being used. Although the experimenter has little control over the variance
of Fvis(Evis). 17 the design might be changed to improve light collection, for
example, if the variance contribution due to photoelectron statistics were sig-
niﬁcant. Again a Gaussian distribution is assumed. The variance contribution
from the sampling transducer is proportional to Evis:

The ﬁrst term is to be expected in any noncompensating calorimeter; it is just
the skewness of Π(Ee) “playing through” to the end. As discussed in Sec. 2, the
dimensionless coeﬃcient of skewness, γ1, is about 0.06 for the model discussed
there (π− on Pb, using an old version of FLUKA), and σnc = 12.5% at 100 GeV

It is interesting that the visible energy deposition and sampling terms also
contribute to the skewness. In the ﬁrst case, this is because the variance of
the visible energy at ﬁxed Ee is proportional to Ee, and so at large Ee a wider
distribution is contributed to Fvis(Evis) than for low Ee—even though for a
given Ee the distribution is (taken to be) Gaussian.

For the same reason, sampling also contributes to the skewness. The ﬁrst two
contributions both vanish if h/e = 1, but the third term does not. Even in the

Abstract. A ﬁber detector concept is suggested allowing to registrate particles within
less than 100 nsec with a space point precision of about 100 µm at low occuppancy.
The ﬁbers should be radiation hard for 1 Mrad/year. Corresponding prototypes have
been build and tested at a 3 GeV electron beam at DESY. Preliminary results of these
tests indicate that the design goal for the detector is reached.

INTRODUCTION

The advantageous use of ﬁber detectors for particle tracking has been demon-
strated for very diﬀerent conditions e.g.
in the UA2-Experiment [1], CHORUS
[2], for D0 [3] and the H1-Forward Proton Spectrometer [4]. Due to the diﬀerent
experimental situation in this applications three types of optoelectronic read out
techniques are applied – Image Intensiﬁer plus CCD’s, Visible Light Photon Coun-
ters and Position Sensitive Photomultipliers. However, all have in common that
the precision of space point measurements is given by hits of overlapping ﬁbers of
several staggered ﬁber layers. For high rate experiments demanding online tracking
of several hundred particles per 100 nsec bunch crossing such a concept may not
work due to too high occupancy of single ﬁber channels.

We propose in the following to use overlapping ﬁber roads reading out several
thin scintillating ﬁbers with one clear optical ﬁber. The demands and the solutions
presented below match to a possible application of the detector as the inner tracker
in the HERA-B project at DESY [5]. Similar ideas have been used by others [6] to
build a ﬁber detector for the DIRAC experiment at CERN.

DETECTOR PRINCIPLE

The ﬁber detector under discussion is aimed to detect throughgoing particles
with more than 90 % eﬃciency within less than 100 nsec and a precision of better
than 100 µm. The ﬁbers should not change their characteristics signiﬁcantly after
an irradiation of 1 – 2 Mrad. The sensitive detector part should have a size of 25
x 25 cm2. The scintillating ﬁbers should be coupled to clear optical ﬁbers of about
3m length guiding the light to photosensors placed outside the experimental area.
It is assumed that most particles of interest hit the detector perpendicular, i.e.
with angles less than ﬁve degrees with respect to the beam axis. In this case low
occupancy and high light yield are guaranteed by using overlapping ﬁber roads like
schematically drawn in ﬁg. 1. One ﬁber road consists of several thin scintillating
ﬁbers arranged precisely behind each other and coupled to one thick light guide
ﬁber. The scintillating ﬁber diameter determines the space point resolution of the
detector. The number of ﬁbers per road is ﬁxed by the scattering angle of particles
and the allowed amount of multiple scattering.
It will also inﬂuence the factor
of background suppression for tracks with larger inclination or curvature. The
pitch between ﬁber roads is deﬁned by demanding a homogeneous amount of ﬁber
material across the detector width.

Keeping in mind the conditions at HERA-B, we made the following choices:

Φf ib = 480µm
Lf ib = 30 cm
Φlg = 1.7 mm
= 300 cm
Llg

Nf ib/road = 7
proad
Nroad
Wdet

= 340 µm
= 640
= 217.6 mm

with Φ and L: diameter and length of scintillating and light guide ﬁbers, Nf ib/road:
number of ﬁbers per road, proad: distance between neighboured road centers, Nroad:
number of roads per detector, Wdet: detector width.

The light guide ﬁbers are read out with the new Hamamatsu6 64 channel PSPM
R5900–M64 with a pixel size of 2 x 2 mm2 [7]. To diminish optical cross talk the
thickness of the entrance window of the device was decreased to 0.8 mm.

The coupling between scintillating and light guide ﬁbers is done by loose plastic
connectors. The light guides are coupled to the PSPM using a plastic mask ﬁtting
the corresponding pixel pattern.

MATERIAL STUDIES

Double clad ﬁbers of three diﬀerent producers7 8 9 were tested concerning light
output, light attenuation and radiation hardness for several ﬁber diameters and

wavelengths of the emitted light. Details of these measurements are given in [8]. A
few results are summarized below.

The light output of ﬁbers of 500 µm diameter is shown in ﬁg. 2. Generally it can
be seen, that the light yield decreases with increasing scintillator emission wave-
length because the PM sensitivity curve is not unfolded. There is no remarkable
diﬀerence between the best materials of the three producers. A mirror at the end
of the ﬁber increases the light output by a factor 1.7.

Several tests were performed to couple scintillating and light guide ﬁbers. Fi-
nally the coupling eﬃciency became better than 95 %, independent of the medium
between both parts (air,glue,grease).

The light attenuation of clear ﬁbers was measured coupling them to single scin-
tillating ﬁber roads excited by a Ruthenium source. The clear ﬁbers were cutted
back piece by piece to the length under investigation. Results for two producers
are given in ﬁg. 3.

Radiation hardness tests of ﬁbers were made using an intense 70 MeV proton
beam at the Hahn–Meitner–Institute Berlin. 1 Mrad radiation was deposited within
a few minutes. For all materials investigated we observed a damage of the scintilla-
tor and the transparency of the ﬁber which was followed by a long time recovery of
up to 600 h. An example is shown in ﬁg 4. More detailed studies using glued and
nonglued ﬁbers and irradiate them in air and nitrogen atmosphere are still ongoing.
Summarizing all results of our material studies we decided to use the KURARAY
ﬁbers SCSF-78M with a diameter of 480 µm for the scintillating part of our detector
prototypes. For clear ﬁbers still two choices seem to be possible: 1.7 mm ﬁbers
from KURARAY or Pol. Hi. Tech..

DETECTOR PRODUCTION

Using winding technology as developed for the CHORUS experiment [9] we built
a detector production chain at our institute. A drum of 80 cm diameter allows to
produce ﬁve detectors at once. The production time for winding one drum is about
14 h. Sticking the ﬁbers to the connector holes is still done by hand and rather
time consuming. A part of the polished end face of one of our detectors is shown
in ﬁg. 5.

Two other detector prototypes are ordered from industry. GMS–Berlin10 followed
a technology proposed by the university of Heidelberg [10] mounting single layers on
top of each other using epoxy glue. Each layer is prepared on a v-grooved vacuum
table. One layer per day can be produced in this case. The connector is here also
added by hand. The production technology used by KURARAY is unknown to us.
To get the precision of the detector geometry quantiﬁed we measured the coor-
dinates of all ﬁbers of the polished end face of the three detectors. In ﬁg. 6 the
deviation from the ideal position is given per ﬁber road. Some stronger local eﬀects

are visible. Averaging these results characteristic accuracies of 20 µm, 50 µm and
10 µm are calculated for the Zeuthen, GMS and KURARAY detectors respectively.

TESTRUN RESULTS

Two testruns were performed to measure the properties of the produced ﬁber
detectors in a 3 GeV electron beam at DESY. The setup used in both cases was
very similar and is schematically drawn in ﬁg. 7. Four silicon microstrip detectors
are used together with two ﬁber reference detectors and an external trigger system
to predict the position of a throughgoing particle at the detector to be tested. A
precision of 50 µm and 80 µm was reached for that prediction using the geometrical
arrangements of testrun 1 and 2. The ﬁber detector signals were registrated after
3m of light guide in the ﬁrst case using a 16 channel PM R5900–M16 read out with
a charge sensitive ADC. In the later run the 64 channel R5900–M64 was used and
the signals were transfered via a special multiplexer to a ﬂash ADC.

In April 1997 ﬁrst small eight road detectors were investigated to measure the
light proﬁle across a ﬁber road. The result is shown in ﬁg. 8. The data can be
described simply by taking into account ﬁber geometry seen by a throughgoing
particle. They allow to calculate the detector eﬃciency for any particular pitch
between the ﬁber roads.

During the testrun in October 1997 the three full size detector prototypes de-
scribed in section 4 were investigated in detail. Up to now only preliminary results
are derived from about 4 Gbyte of data.

A relation of 0.9/1.0/0.8 was found for the average light output of the Zeuthen,
GMS and KURARAY detectors. It seems to be due to the diﬀerent quality of the
end face polishing rather than to the mechanical detector precision.

The detector eﬃciency and resolution is dependent on the hit selection method
used. With a maximum amplitude search for all PSPM pixels we calculated rough
values of 97 ± 3 % for the eﬃciency and about 140 µm for the resolution of the
three detectors. (see also ﬁgs. 9 and 10). Taking into account the ﬁnite resolution
of our track prediction of 80 µm and the total mechanical alignment not better
than 50 µm this points to a ﬁber detector resolution of better than 100 µm.

Work is in progress to qualify these results. In addition the detector noise has
still to be studied in detail. Optical and electrical cross talk will inﬂuence the
choice of cuts and the hit selection methods and in this way also eﬃciencies and
resolution.

SUMMARY

Three ﬁber detector prototypes have been tested. They are made out of 640
overlapping roads of seven 480 µm diameter ﬁbers coupled to 1.7 mm diameter
light guides of 3 m length read out with 64 channel photomultipliers. For all three
detectors a preliminary analysis gives an eﬃciency of about 97 % and a resolution

of about 100 µm. These results together with radiation hardness studies of the
used ﬁber material seem to make it possible to use a corresponding detector in a
high rate experiment like HERA-B. In such case special care has to be taken to
keep noise from optical and electrical cross talk at an acceptable level.

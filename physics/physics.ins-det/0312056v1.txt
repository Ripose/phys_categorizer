Abstract

We have exposed seven full length production quality crystals of the electromagnetic calorimeter
(ECAL) of the CMS detector to a 20 GeV/c proton beam at the CERN PS accelerator. The expo-
sure was done at ﬂuxes of 1012 p/cm2/h and 1013 p/cm2/h and integral ﬂuences of 1012 p/cm2 and
1013 p/cm2 were reached at both rates. The light transmission of the crystals was measured after irra-
diation and suitable cooling time for induced radioactivity to decrease to a safe level. First results of
these measurements are shown. The possible damage mechanisms are discussed and simulations based
on one possible model are presented. The implications for long-term operation of CMS are discussed
and it is shown that in the whole barrel and at least most of the ECAL endcap hadron damage alone
– even if cumulative – should not cause the crystals to fail the CMS speciﬁcation of µIND < 1.5 m−1
during the ﬁrst 10 years of LHC operation.

1 Introduction
Lead Tungstate (PbWO 4) crystals are being used by several high-energy physics experiments because they provide
a compact homogeneous calorimeter with fast scintillation. In view of the harsh radiation conditions expected in the
CMS experiment, the radiation hardness of PbWO 4 has been extensively studied with γ-irradiations. A systematic
irradiation study with high-energy hadrons has so far not been extended up to the full ﬂuences expected at the
LHC.

The fundamental difference between γ-irradiation and energetic hadrons is that the latter produce inelastic nuclear
interactions (stars) in the crystal. These interactions break up the target nucleus and thus create impurities and
distortions in the crystal lattice. The slow nuclear fragments produced in each hadronic interaction can have a
range of up to 10 µm. Along their path they displace a large number of lattice atoms, but also ionize much more
densely than a minimum ionizing particle. Neither the displacements, nor the dense ionization, although in a
very small volume, can be produced in γ-irradiations. Since the threshold for star production is ∼20 MeV, reactor
neutron irradiations do not cover this regime either.

2 The crystals, irradiations and measurements
We have studied CMS production quality crystals from Bogoroditsk. The crystals have a nearly parallelepipedic
shape with dimensions of 2.6 × 2.6 × 23 cm3. Except for slightly non-compliant mechanical dimensions all
crystals satisﬁed the technical speciﬁcations for their use in the CMS ECAL. All crystals were pre-tested for
radiation hardness at the Geneva Hospital γ-irradiation facility for 2 h at 250 Gy/h and showed a radiation induced
absorption coefﬁcient µIND < 1.5 m−1 at 440 nm as required by the CMS technical speciﬁcations [1]. The crystals
were subsequently annealed.

An irradiation test of PbWO 4 with hadrons is complicated mainly by the fact that the crystals become highly
radioactive. Therefore our aim was to make the simplest possible test by irradiating bare crystals and measuring
the longitudinal light transmission (LT) after irradiation. The irradiations were performed at the IRRAD1 facility
in the T7 beam-line of the CERN PS accelerator. The proton momentum was 20 GeV/c and the exposure was
uniform to within a factor of two over the crystal front face at ﬂuxes of ∼ 1012 p/cm2/h and ∼ 1013 p/cm2/h. The
beam was parallel to the long axis of the crystal. The ﬂuence was determined by 22Na activity in aluminum foils
in front of the crystals and correlated with the induced radioactivity in the crystals themselves measured at 4.5 cm
distance, as shown in Fig. 1. The 22Na activity for the irradiation of crystal F’ is inconsistent for some unknown
reason. For this crystal we deduce the ﬂuence by using the induced radioactivity and the correlation determined
from the other irradiations. Table 1 shows the ﬂuence from 22Na and the total ﬂuence used in our analysis. Crystals
which were irradiated at a rate of 1012 p/cm2/h are indicated by small letters, those exposed to 1013 p/cm2/h by
capital letters. Two of the crystals, labeled a(a’) and F(F’), were irradiated twice, so for a’ and F’ the last column
of table 1 shows the added ﬂuence of two irradiations.

We have measured LT for each crystal with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer using depolarized light
of 300–800 nm in 1 nm steps. The light beam was about 7 mm wide and 10 mm high. A check of reproducibility
showed that the measured LT has an accuracy of ± 1% [2].

3 Results

Fig. 2(a) shows the full LT curves over the whole measured range of wavelengths, for crystals a(a’) and F(F’).
Crystal “a” was irradiated at a 10 times smaller rate than crystal “F”. As can be seen, the LT for the lower ﬂuence
irradiation is different between “a” and “F”. This can be due to the fact that µIND(440 nm) might be dominated
by the damage induced by the total ionization, i.e. conditions similar to γ-irradiations. Such a damage is known to
saturate at a level which depends on the dose rate. At the higher ﬂuences, however, the LT curves are quite similar,
which might indicate that between integral ﬂuences of 1012 p/cm2 and 1013 p/cm2 speciﬁc hadronic damage starts
to dominate. An important observation is also that after hadron exposure the LT band-edge has shifted to longer
wavelengths.

Fig. 2(b) shows, as a function of ﬂuence, µIND(440 nm) measured 20 and 50 days after the end of each irradiation.
At low ﬂuences our data do not allow to make a distinction between a pure dose rate and a possibly cumulative
effect. At high ﬂuences the dependence on rate is very small, while our data indicate a clear – possibly linear –
dependence on integral ﬂuence. With the ﬂuences reached and for the rates used, we observe no sign of saturation.
Causes of the effects observed could be:
- High-energy hadrons producing a speciﬁc cumulative damage, with essentially no recovery, combined with a
damage which anneals at room temperature with a time constant of at least several months.
- The γ dose rate caused by the charge of the protons [3].

Room temperature recovery, recorded up to now, is shown in Fig. 3. The data do not yet allow to extrapolate to
LHC-like time-scales.

4 Monte-Carlo simulations

Simulations were performed to understand the hadron ﬂuences, star density and dose as a function of depth in the
crystal. They show that after an initial increase all distributions are fairly ﬂat with a slow decrease after a maximum
at ∼7.5 cm.

Figure 4: Ionizing dE/dx (and total for Pb) of ions in PbWO4 and simulated fragment spectra from hadronic
interactions.

The average values for one proton per cm2 are 1.63 cm−2 for the charged hadron ﬂuence, 0.126 cm−3 for the star
density and 1.37 nGy for ionizing dose. A detailed simulation of the full atomic cascade initiated by the fragments
shows that for an incident proton ﬂuence of 1013 p/cm2 the concentration of displacements and interstitials might
reach 10−8 which is far below the pre-irradiation imperfections. Thus if speciﬁc hadronic damage is produced, it is
more likely to be due to the dense ionization of the ion tracks. Fig. 4 shows that for the fragment spectra produced
by inelastic interactions, the energy loss can be more than 4 orders of magnitude above the dE/dx of a minimum
ionizing particle. Making the hypothesis that tracks exceeding a value (dE/dx) crit are responsible for hadronic
damage, we can compare the 20 GeV/c irradiation with the expected CMS ECAL endcap (EE) conditions. Fig. 5
shows that, depending on (dE/dx)crit, the simulated track length per star produced by the 20 GeV/c beam is a factor
between 2.7 and 8.7 higher than in the EE. The star density for 1013 cm−2 protons corresponds to more than η=2
in the EE. With the possible factor of 2.7–8.7, our irradiations cover the high-precision area of the EE for 10 years
operation and possibly even the whole EE up to η=2.9.

5 Conclusions

Our LT measurements of PbWO4 crystals after exposure to 20 GeV/c protons are consistent with a hypothesis
of cumulative hadronic damage, although the small number of crystals and limited ﬂuence range does not allow
a deﬁnitive statement yet. Room temperature recovery is very slow and possibly partial. Even under the most
pessimistic assumption of permanent cumulative damage, our results verify that the CMS barrel ECAL will meet
its design speciﬁcations over 10 years. Simulations, used to compare the conditions in our test beam and the EE
under the hypothesis of hadronic damage, indicate that in most of the EE µIND due to hadronic damage alone
is likely to stay below 1.5 m−1 for 10 years of LHC operation. To gain a better understanding we will extend
our irradiations to higher ﬂuences (5×1013 p/cm2) and to possibly lower hadron energies, and we will follow the
damage recovery. Finally, comparative γ-irradiations at dose rates corresponding to those of the proton beam are
expected to provide the most stringent test of speciﬁc hadronic damage.

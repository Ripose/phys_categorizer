ABSTRACT

X-ray scanners for gain mapping of ATLAS Barrel Transition Radiation Tracker
(TRT) modules 1 were developed at Hampton University for quality assurance pur-
poses. Gas gain variations for each straw of the TRT modules were used to decide
whether wires should be removed or restrung, and to evaluate overall module quality.

1 Introduction

In the ATLAS experiment [1] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, straw-
tube Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) Barrel detectors will play an major role
in providing precise tracking with transition radiation (TR) capability for electron
identiﬁcation. To achieve stability against high-voltage breakdown at the very high
interaction rate of the LHC, it is important that the sense wires be centered in
the 1.44 m-long straws. An oﬀ-center (oﬀset) wire will break down at a lower high
voltage than a centered wire, reducing the range of operation of the device. Wires
can be oﬀset as a function of position for a variety of reasons, including bending
of the 1.44 m-long straws. Since the average gas gain also increases with oﬀset, a
measurement of gas gain as a function of position along a wire can be used to indicate
whether or not the wire is oﬀset at any point [2]. Here, we brieﬂy describe the

whether wires are oﬀset.

2 X-ray Scanner for ATLAS TRT

The X-ray photon energy for the gain survey can be chosen to optimize the time to
obtain the required gas gain resolution. This depends on several factors: attenuation
of the X-rays in the module, conversion of the X-rays in the active gas, and ability
to ﬁnd the gain through an analysis of the spectrum. For surveying the largest of
the three module types (type 3), we found that 12 keV is close to optimum. To
obtain a photon beam of this energy, X-ray ﬂuorescence from bromine was used; the
primary beam came from a 50 kV x-ray tube.

The basic chain of the electronics [3] and the data acquisition (DAQ)
scheme are shown in ﬁgure 1. The signals from the sense wires are ampliﬁed and
shaped and then passed on to ADCs. For each wire, spectra are collected from 50
positions along the z direction. For each spectrum, a monitor spectrum was col-
lected from a ﬁxed point on a straw (not being scanned) exposed to an 55Fe source.
The ionization gas was a mixture of argon and CO2 (70:30) with a ﬂow rate of about
1 straw volume/hr. The nominal operating high voltage (HV) for surveying was set
to 1235 volts. Figure 2 shows a typical spectrum from the 55Fe source and bromine
XRF, respectively.

tion scheme.

The raw spectra were recorded with straw number, run number, z position,
and slow control data. Later, the peak in each spectrum was ﬁtted with a Gaussian
function that determines the mean (gp), standard deviation (σp), and goodness of
ﬁt. The ratio of the straw mean to the monitor mean of 55Fe is multiplied by 500
to give the normalized gain, gn. The gain variation G is deﬁned as G = (gn,max −
gn,min)/gn,min and used to determine the wire oﬀset from the center as shown in
ﬁgure 3.

X-ray scanners for the purpose of quality control of the ATLAS TRT Barrel detector
modules were developed at Hampton University and are operating at HU and CERN.
The scanners map the gain using 12 keV photons at 50 points along each straw.
Results were used to decide whether wires were removed or re-strung, and to evaluate
overall module quality.

gain variation G along the z direction from one straw is shown on the right. The
solid line indicates G of 8%. Wires over 8% of G are ﬂagged for possible restringing
or removal.

Abstract

High quality low leakage SINIS devices made of Al-AlMn-Al layers were fabricated for energy dispersive single
photon detection. Information on diﬀerent heat ﬂow channels was extracted from the measured dynamics of
detector signals due to X-ray events. At the optimum operation point, the extracted eﬀective electron temperature
decreased from 88 mK down to 43 mK due to self-cooling, roughly doubling the detector sensitivity.

Key words: Microcalorimeter, Cryogenic detector, Tunnel junction, Microfabrication, Self-cooling

Energy resolving single photon detectors are of
great interest for astrophysics, material science,
medical applications or any other ﬁeld, where high
quantum eﬃciency paired with direct energy in-
formation are desirable. Normal metal–insulator–
superconductor (NIS) junction based cryogenic mi-
crocalorimeters are very attractive and proven can-
didates for such high resolution detectors [1]. Es-
sential requirements for NIS spectrometers are low
barrier leakage currents and operation at low tem-
peratures for a small heat capacity of the absorber.
The latter can be met or improved by the Peltier-
like eﬀect of hot electron tunneling [2,3,4]. The ef-
ﬁciency of power transfer out of the absorber is
increased by coupling the normal metal symmetri-
cally via two tunnel junctions in series [5] (SINIS
structure). Heat ﬂow mechanisms upon energy de-
position are reﬂected by detector signal dynamics.
We have fabricated high quality SINIS junctions
by standard optical lithography and metal evapo-

ration deposition (see inset of Fig. 1 for schematic
drawing). The superconducting electrodes were
pure Aluminium (Al, ∼ 300 nm thick), whereas the
normal absorber was Al doped with 0.3 . . . 0.6 %
of Manganese (Mn, 10 . . . 500 nm thick) in order to
suppress Cooper pairing [6]. An additional Silver
layer (100 nm . . . 8 µm) was eventually deposited
on top of the AlMn absorber in order to increase
absorption eﬃciency to X-rays. The native AlOx
forming the tunnel barrier yielded excellent and
highly stable device characteristics with very low
leakage currents. The product of (single) junction
area A and normal resistance Rn was ρn = RnA =
0.6 . . . 40 kΩµm2 for diﬀerent oxide thicknesses.
Figure 1 shows current-voltage characteristics
of a high ρn device together with its diﬀeren-
tial resistance Rd = ∂V /∂J. The measured gap
corresponds twice the Al gap (∆Al = 172 µeV).
This fact and the perfect symmetry of the char-
acteristics indicate no signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the
Mn doping on tunneling current. Low leakage is
required for current biased detector operation.

From extrapolation of the voltage dependent low
current Rd to V → 0 we extract a device base
temperature of Tb = 88 mK, in spite of a cryo-
stat temperature of about 50 mK. The elevated
Tb is due to background blackbody radiation and
the presence of a relatively powerful 55Fe X-ray
source. The ratio of leakage resistance to Rn was
5.6 · 105 for the device in Fig. 1 (representative for
high ρn samples) and decreased moderately for
increasing barrier transparency (lower ρn).

ciently removed from the barrier region can leak
back to the absorber volume [7].

Here we estimate Pbg ≈ 160 pW.

The thermal conductances G = dP/ dT determine
the time constants τ = C(T )/G of the relaxation
processes, where C(T ) = γT ν is the electronic spe-
ciﬁc heat and γ the Sommerfeld constant. We have
investigated the dynamics of detector signals due
to X-ray events as shown in Fig. 2 for two diﬀerent
bias voltages.

Upon energy deposition in the absorber and
(presumably quick) energy transfer to the electron

at two diﬀerent operation points. Note the change in signal
dynamics (decay time τ ).

For this type of experiment we have typically
chosen low ρn devices since the self-cooling power
is predicted [3] to increase with increasing barrier
transparency, i.e. Ptun ∝ R−1
n . However, the junc-
tions with the thinnest oxide barriers revealed a
partial suppression of the gap on the superconduct-
ing electrode side due to proximity of the ferro-
magnetic impurities (see IV in Fig. 3a). In order
to keep the X-ray induced T and J variations small
to maintain the simple model approach, a rather
large (5 µm thick) absorber volume was used. De-
tector signals were recorded over the bias voltage
range of suﬃcient sensitivity and ﬁtted to the an-
alytical model to extract the (essentially exponen-
tial) pulse decay time τ , which is plotted in Fig. 3c.

crease in sensitivity compared to a model without
self-cooling. The eﬀect of microrefrigeration com-
pensates (in our case) at least for the power load
from background radiation.

In spite of the remarkable consistency between
measurements and our simple model, degradation
due to backheating should in most cases be consid-
ered. Technically, the eﬀect can be reduced by very
thick electrodes or implementation of trapping lay-
ers [9]. Furthermore, we observed an indication of
incomplete thermalization and partial phonon es-
cape from the absorber. This was reﬂected by a rel-
atively poor spectral energy resolution of our de-
vices. Improvements are expected from deposition
of the detector on a membrane [1] or fabrication of
a fully suspended absorber bridge with small junc-
tion areas.

device at 88 mK. The deviation from exponential behaviour
at low currents (< 10 nA) is due to leakage onset. The ar-
rows indicate the operation points for the signals shown
in Fig. 2. The abscissa was converted to display current
(instead of bias voltage) for improved visibility in the rel-
evant range. (b) Corresponding diﬀerential resistance. (c)
Decay time τ of measured detector signals upon deposition

perature Te of the absorber. (e) Measured current signal
amplitude (solid line). The dashed line is a theoretical cal-
culation assuming an eﬀective Te as shown in (d), whereas
the dotted line assumes Te = 88 mK.

Using Eqs. (1,2) and neglecting the eﬀect of
backheating we can calculate an eﬀective Te from
τ and for given device parameters, as shown in
Fig. 3d. Due to its T 5
e dependence the value of Te
is not very sensitive to modest variations of model
parameters. In Fig. 3e we plot the measured X-ray
event signal amplitudes (solid line) together with
theoretical calculations using an electron temper-
ature as determined in Fig. 3d (dashed line) as
well as for Te = 88 mK (dotted line). Note the
excellent agreement between experimental data
and theory assuming a variable Te, and the in-

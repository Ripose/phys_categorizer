Abstract

GaAs Schottky diode particle detectors have been fabricated upon Low Pressure Vapour Phase Epitaxial
GaAs. The devices were characterised with both electrical and charge collection techniques. The height of
the Ti-GaAs barrier used was determined via two electrical methods to be 0.81 ± 0.005 and 0.85 ± 0.01 eV.
The current density was greater than that expected for an ideal Schottky barrier and the excess current was
attributed to generation current in the bulk of the material. A space charge density of 2.8 ± 0.2 × 1014 cm−3
was determined from capacitance voltage characterisation. The charge collection eﬃciency was determined
from front alpha illumination and 60 keV gamma irradiation to be greater than 95% at a reverse bias of
50 V.

The diodes were characterised after an exposure to a radiation ﬂuence of 1.25 × 1014 24GeV/c pro-
tons cm−2. The reverse current measured at 20o C increased from 90 nA to 1500 nA at an applied reverse
bias of 200 V due to the radiation induced creation of extra generation centres. The capacitance measure-
ments showed a dependence upon the test signal frequency which is a characteristic of deep levels. The
capacitance measured at 5 V reverse bias with a test frequency of 100 Hz fell with radiation from 300 pF to
40 pF due to the removal of measurable free carriers. The charge collection of the device determined from
front alpha illumination also fell to 32 ± 5% at a reverse bias of 200 V.

Introduction

The possible use of GaAs detectors in the future high energy physics experiment ATLAS[1] at the LHC imposes
severe demands on the radiation hardness of the detectors. Semi-insulating undoped GaAs detectors have
shown signiﬁcant charge collection degradation after a 24 GeV/c proton ﬂuence of order 1 × 1014 cm−2[2, 3].
The increase in the reverse current after this ﬂuence, however, is slight, (in the region of 2-3 times greater).
This charge collection reduction can not be tolerated and requires data on the radiation hardness of other
GaAs materials. Epitaxial material with a low initial deep level concentration, and thus high pre-irradiation
charge collection eﬃciency (cce), could provide the necessary radiation tolerance and therefore this material
was investigated.

GaAs detectors are also ideally suited as X-ray imaging detectors for medical applications due to their high
atomic number. To obtained the best X-ray images a high charge collection eﬃciency is required, preferably
at low bias, and thus a low concentration of deep levels is desired. Epitaxial GaAs should be ideal for this
application and this application contributed to the motivation of this work.

2 Experimental

The low pressure vapour phase epitaxial GaAs was grown by Epitronics Corporation[4] on the surface of a
450 µm thick Hitachi Cable Horizontal Bridgeman GaAs substrate. The substrate was n+ in nature with silicon
doping at a concentration of 1018 cm−3. The VPE layer was n-type and varied in thickness across the wafer
from approximately 240 µm to 125 µm. The surface of the VPE layer was chemo-mechanically polished with a
H2O2:NH4 solution at a pH of 7.9±0.1, a process used in the preparation of LEC wafers at Glasgow University[5].
This process removed approximately 30 µm from the VPE layer and reduced surface imperfections.

Circular diodes of 4 mm is diameter were fabricated with metallic electrodes evaporated onto the front
(VPE side) and back of the material. The front Schottky contact was a Ti/Pd/Au multi-layer while the back
metallisation was Pd/Ge. The rear contact was not annealed and the ohmic contact was realised due to the n+
substrate.

Electrical and charge collection characterisation were performed on the diodes. The electrical characterisa-
tions were carried out at 300 K with the use of a Keithley-237 source measurement unit and a Hewlett Packard
4274A multi-frequency LCR meter. The response of the diodes to alpha particle irradiation from an Am-241
source under vacuum and to 60 keV photons from an encapsulated Am-241 source were determined. Since
the front of the alpha source was coated with surface contamination, which reduced the energy of the alpha
particles, the average energy was determined with an over-depleted silicon detector to be 4.1 MeV. The diodes
were biased and read-out with an EG&G Ortec-142 pre-ampliﬁer. The signal was shaped with an Ortec-485
post-ampliﬁer with a shaping time of 500 ns and sent to a multichannel analyser.

Four of the VPE diodes were exposed to a ﬂuence of 1.25×1014 24 GeV/c protons cm−2 to test their radiation
hardness. The irradiation was performed at the CERN PS[6], Switzerland, at room temperature and without
bias. The diodes were stored for three months at room temperature after irradiation before characterisation.
No search was made for eﬀects due to annealing over this period.

3 Pre-irradiation Characteristics

Figure 1 shows the current-voltage characteristics of the VPE Schottky diode under both forward and reverse
bias and demonstrate standard Schottky characteristics for low bias, as shown in ﬁgure 1(a). However, at higher
bias the reverse current did not saturate and continued to increase until diode breakdown at approximately
180 V.

From the forward bias characteristic two methods were used to determine the barrier height[7]. The ﬁrst
found the value of the saturation current (Js) from the extrapolation of the current characteristics to zero
forward bias, shown in ﬁgure 2. Using equation 1 with a Richardson constant (A∗∗) of 8 Acm−2K−2, the barrier
height (φB) was found to be 0.81 ± 0.005 V, where the error was due to the uncertainty of A∗∗.

This method requires the exact dimensions of the contact area (Se) to determine the current density. The
second method, which utilises the temperature dependence of the forward current, has no such dependence.
The current was measured at 0.1 V over the temperature range 293 to 308 K. The forward current may be

The barrier height for the VPE diode was found from a plot of ln(I/T 2) against 1/T to equal 0.85 ± 0.01 V.
The error was found from the error in the linear regression ﬁt to the data.

Capacitance measurements were performed on the diodes. The C-V curves did not show a signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the measurements made with a test signal frequency of 100 Hz and 100 kHz, therefore the
concentration of deep levels with a low emission frequency was assumed to be negligible. A doping density (ND)
of 2.8 ± 0.2 × 1014 cm−3 for the VPE layer was determined from the capacitance voltage characteristics of the
device over a reverse bias range 0-20 V. Such a high value has implications for the extension of the depletion
width of the device under reverse bias and thus the charge collection of the device.

The reverse current characteristic was investigated to determine the cause of non-saturation. Figure 3 shows
the current voltage dependence up to a reverse bias of 10 V. Illustrated on the ﬁgure is the current that would
be expected for an ideal barrier. As can be seen this is considerably less than that measured. The eﬀect on
the current due to image force lowering of the barrier height for the measured doping density of the material is
shown as the dotted line in the ﬁgure. This was insuﬃcient to account for the observed current. The current
was assumed to be generation current and a ﬁt of the form:

where NC is the eﬀective density of states in the conduction band.

The values obtained for the parameters were: P (1) = 0.66 ± 0.02 nA/mm2 and P (2) = 0.53 ± 0.02. For
generation current the expected value of P (2) = 0.5 which corresponds to that found and therefore the current
was attributed to generation eﬀects. The activation energy of the current at -10V was found to equal 0.73 ±
0.02 eV which is equal, within errors, to half the bandgap energy. The generation current was not likely to be
due to the mid-gap donor EL2, as is the case in LEC material, because the concentration of this deep level was
low.

From the capacitance voltage measurements the depletion width as a function of bias was determined up to
a bias of 180V, as shown in ﬁgure 4. At 100 V the depletion depth was only 22.3 µm, increasing to 27.4 µm at
150 V. The low values were due to the high density of donors in the material. The low depletion depth and the
high current resulted in the signal from a high energy beta particle being indistinguishable from the electronic
noise of the device. For a 100% cce the signal would equal only 3600 electrons at a bias of 150 V. The cce
determined for 60 keV gamma photons was 97 ± 17% at a bias of 200V. The error is due to the spread in the
peak due to the high leakage current of the device at this bias. Due to the 450 µm thick n+ layer on the back
side of the device the detector was only sensitive to alpha particle illumination from the front surface. Although
the range of 4.1 MeV alpha particles in GaAs is only ∼ 13µm, due to the comparably small depletion region
the detector response was no longer due primarily to one charge carrier. The charge collection eﬃciency as a
function of both bias and depletion depth, calculated from the CV data, are shown in ﬁgure 5 for two VPE
diodes. The charge collection showed the expected increase with bias due to the increase in depletion width.
The maximum cce’s for the two detectors were 100±7% and 93±7% at a bias close to 150 V. The cce plateaued
for a depletion width between 10 µm and 15 µm as expected from the alpha particle range in GaAs. At zero
applied bias, however, the depletion width, calculated from the capacitance measurements, was only 2 µm but
a signal of 65% of the full alpha particle signal was obtained. Therefore diﬀusion or drift of charge into the
depletion region must occur.

Reverse bias (V)

Figure 6: The current-voltage characteristics of the VPE diodes before and after a 24GeV/c proton ﬂuence
of 1.25 × 1014 cm−2, measured at 300 K. The key is: dot-dashed line - reverse current before; solid line -
reverse current after; dashed line - forward current after irradiation. The forward current before irradiation is
indistinguishable from the current axis on this ﬁgure.

150 V compared to only 4.6 nA/mm2 before irradiation. The forward current on the other hand was reduced
after the ﬂuence. The current characteristic was more resistive in nature and thus the resistivity of the material
had increased. This implies that the product of the mobility and the free carrier concentration was reduced.
A reduction in mobility is very likely as the increased number of defect centres will increase the concentration
of scattering centres and thus reduce the mobility. The free carrier concentration will be reduced if deep levels
are introduced which compensate the material and thus cause the Fermi level to approach mid-bandgap. The
activation energy of the reverse current was measured at a bias of -10V and -100V to be 0.57 ± 0.01 eV if
generation current was assumed. The change in activation energy was due to the presence of radiation induced
deep levels.

The capacitance-voltage relationship shows a dependence upon the frequency of the test signal used to make
the measurement, illustrated in ﬁgure 7(a). The high frequency capacitance did not change with bias. This
is characteristic of measurements made on high resistivity material where the capacitance measured with a
high frequency test signal equals the geometrical capacitance of the device[5]. For this diode the measured
capacitance at 100 kHz was 13 pF. The thickness of the VPE layer was not measured directly but a device of
this capacitance implies that the diode is 110µm thick, which is in the expected range for the thickness of the
VPE material.

The capacitance voltage dependence before and after irradiation are compared in ﬁgure 7(b). The measured
capacitance at a given bias fell and at -5 V was only 40 pF compared to 300 pF. As the measured capacitance
depends upon the density of free carriers and the density of traps which have emission rates greater than
the frequency of the A.C. test voltage, the reduction in the measured capacitance implies that the density of
these carriers was reduced. Therefore a signiﬁcant concentration of deep levels was created in the material
due to the proton ﬂuence. The eﬀective trap concentration (Nef f ) was deduced from the 1/C2 bias voltage
dependence shown in ﬁgure 8, measured between -5 V and -30 V, to be only 1.3 × 1013 cm3. The reduction
in free carrier density measured as a fall in Nef f and as an increase in resistivity implies that either acceptor
(electron) traps have been introduced and/or that the Fermi level has been lowered, resulting in a lower free
carrier concentration. Lowering of the Fermi level will be caused by an increased concentration of deep levels
that remove electrons from the conduction band, that is acceptor levels.

The charge collection eﬃciency of the irradiated device was investigated. Again results from high energy
beta particles could not be obtained due to leakage current noise. The increase in reverse current also prevented
the detection of 60 keV photons. Charge collection from front illumination by alpha particles was obtained and
is illustrated in ﬁgure 9 as a function of bias. The cce fell from ∼100% before irradiation to 32 ± 4% measured
at 200V. The diode did not breakdown until higher voltages and a cce of 55% was measured at the highest
possible voltage of 480 V.

5 Comparison to LEC diodes

LEC diode. After irradiation, however, the reverse current of the VPE diode increased dramatically by over an
order of magnitude, but, for the LEC diode the increase was only by a factor of two at a reverse bias of 100 V.
The charge collection of the VPE diode was higher than the LEC diode both before and after irradiation.
It should be noted, however, that the VPE diode had a depletion width of only ∼30µm and therefore the eﬀect
of a short absorption length will be less signiﬁcant.

6 Conclusions

The Schottky diodes fabricated with VPE GaAs behaved according to simple theory, that is without the presence
of a signiﬁcant concentration of deep traps. Titanium-GaAs barrier heights of 0.81 ± 0.005eV and 0.85 ± 0.01 eV
were measured which are closed to those quoted in the literature. The reverse current-voltage characteristic
did not saturate, an eﬀect attributed to generation current in the depletion region. The donor concentration
was obtained via CV analysis of the material to be 2.8 ± 0.2 × 1014 cm−3, which prevented the extension of the
depletion region beyond ∼30 µm before breakdown occurred, due to the high bias required (>200 V). Charge
collection experiments were limited due to the small depletion region. The charge collection eﬃciencies obtained
from front alpha particle and 60keV gamma irradiation were close to 100%.

After a 24GeV/c proton ﬂuence of 1.25 × 1014 cm−2 the VPE diode had a reverse current density measured
at 100V reverse bias and 300 K, of 5.3 × 10−6 Acm−2. This may be compared to 2.8 × 10−6 Acm−2 for an
LEC diode after the same ﬂuence. The current increase for the VPE diode was over an order of magnitude.
It must be noted, however, that the VPE diode was not guarded and a guarded ring could reduce the current
due to a reduction in surface currents. Deep levels were introduced. From the increase in resistance and the
capacitance-voltage dependence the deep levels were appear to be acceptors. A fall in charge collection eﬃciency
from front alpha illumination was observed and at a reverse bias of 200 V the cce fell from 100% to 32 ± 5%.
In comparison with a typical LEC diode the VPE diode had a lower leakage current before irradiation, but
this was not true after the radiation ﬂuence. Charge collection from a SI-U detector was considerably worse
than in the VPE device both before and after the radiation ﬂuence. The small depletion width of the VPE
diode, however, means that the results can not be directly compared.

The material could be very promising for detector development if the free carrier concentration can be

reduced to allow an increased depletion width. The materials radiation hardness is still a cause for concern.

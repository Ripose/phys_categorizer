Atomic hydrogen cleaning followed by heat cleaning at 450◦C was used to pre-
pare negative-electron-aﬃnity GaAs photocathodes. When hydrogen ions were
eliminated, quantum eﬃciencies of 15% were obtained for bulk GaAs cathodes,
higher than the results obtained using conventional 600◦C heat cleaning. The low-
temperature cleaning technique was successfully applied to thin, strained GaAs
cathodes used for producing highly polarized electrons. No depolarization was ob-
served even when the optimum cleaning time of about 30 seconds was extended by
a factor of 100.

1. Introduction

Recently the high-gradient-doping technique has been applied to photo-
cathode structures to successfully overcome the surface charge limit eﬀect
while maintaining high spin polarization. The high-gradient-doping tech-
nique consists of a thin (10 nm), very-highly-doped (5×1019 cm−3) surface
layer with a lower density doping (5×1017 cm−3) in the remaining active
layer. High dopant density promotes recombination of the minority carriers
trapped at the surface. Trapped carriers increase the surface barrier in pro-
portion to the arrival rate of photoexcited conduction band (CB) electrons.
Because CB electrons depolarize as they diﬀuse to the surface of heavily
doped materials, the highly doped layer must be very thin, typically no
more than a few nanometers. However, to achieve high quantum eﬃcien-
cies, an negative-alectron-aﬃnity (NEA) surface is required, which in turn
must be prepared on an atomically clean surface. The conventional way to

achieve a surface free of all surface oxides and carbon-related contaminants
is to heat the crystal to 600◦C for about 1 hour. After only about 2 hours
at this temperature, diﬀusion of the dopant in the thin, highly-doped layer
results in the re-appearance of the surface charge limit eﬀect. Therefore,
high temperature heat cleaning should be avoided.

Atomic hydrogen cleaning (AHC) is a well known technique for remov-
ing oxides and carbon-related contaminants at relatively low temperatures.
While As-oxides and Ga2O-like oxides are liberated at temperatures less
than 450◦C, the removal of Ga2O3-like oxides requires a higher tempera-
ture. Under atomic hydrogen irradiation, Ga2O3-like oxides are converted
to more volatile Ga2O-like oxides. On the other hand, it has been well
demonstrated that atomic hydrogen can passivate both shallow donor and
acceptor impurities. The passivation rate increases rapidly with the doping
concentration. Since the band-bending in the photocathode is controlled
by the p−type doping, the dopant passivation may have an adverse eﬀect
on QE.

In the present paper, a systematic study of AHC in a vacuum-loading
system is reported. The AHC system and the associated analysis system
remain under UHV, while the sample is introduced in the UHV system
through a loading chamber, and transferred between the AHC and analysis
systems under vacuum 1.

2. Experiment
Two types of GaAs samples were used. Samples (13 × 13 mm2) cut from
Zn-doped (1×1019 cm−3) bulk GaAs (001) wafers were used for optimizing
the AHC conditions. Strained GaAs samples with the active 100-nm GaAs
layer Zn-doped at 5×1018 cm−3 were used for studying the AHC eﬀect on
polarization. Prior to installation in the loading chamber, a sample was
degreased in a boiling solution of trichloroethylene and chemically cleaned
in NH4OH to remove native oxides on the surface. Since NH4OH etches
only oxides without disturbing the stoichiometry of GaAs, it was used for
the epitaxial photocathodes as well. Some samples were installed without
the NH4OH cleaning to intentionally leave native oxides on the surface.

The experiments were carried out in a three-chamber UHV system con-
sisting of a loading chamber, an AHC system and an analysis system called
Cathode Test System (CTS). The AHC system was equipped with an rf
plasma discharge source, a heater tower, and a linear translator. The sur-
face temperature during AHC was maintained at 300 - 350◦C. The heater

tower was electrically isolated from the AHC system so that a bias voltage
could be applied to the GaAs sample during AHC. Atomic hydrogen was
produced by dissociating molecular hydrogen in a 2.5 cm diameter Pyrex
glassware surrounded by a helical rf resonator following the design used at
Jeﬀerson Lab. 2 To study the eﬀect of hydrogen ions generated by the rf
dissociator, the GaAs sample could be biased negatively to enhance ion col-
lection. To reduce the ion current, a transverse magnetic ﬁeld was applied
at the exit of the dissociator using a permanent magnet. With the magnet
in place, the ion current was negligible ( < 1 nA).

Activation to an NEA surface, and measurement of QE and polarization
were made in the CTS. After AHC, the sample was transferred to the CTS
under vacuum when the AHC system pressure dropped to a few 10−8 Torr,
typically within 30 minutes after AHC. The cathode activation method used
to obtain an NEA surface consisted of heat cleaning for 1 hour, cool-down
for an hour, followed by application of cesium until the photo-yield peaked,
and then cesium and nitrogen-triﬂuoride co-deposition until the photo-yield
was again maximized.

AHC was performed on NH4OH-cleaned bulk GaAs samples under three
diﬀerent conditions that control the ion current: 1) with no bias and no
magnet, 2) with a negative 88-Volt bias and no magnet to enhance the ion
eﬀect, and 3) with magnet and no bias to eliminate the ion eﬀect. For
each AHC, a fresh cathode sample was used and only the AHC time was
varied while all other conditions were ﬁxed. After AHC, the sample was
transferred to the CTS under vacuum, heat-cleaned at 450◦C, activated,
and the QE measured. Figure 1 shows the QE at 670 nm as a function
of the AHC time. QEs as high as 16% were obtained with only 15 - 30
seconds of AHC. The QE decreased with prolonged cleaning, yielding only
1.8% after 40 minutes of AHC. The QE was higher when the ion current was
eliminated using the magnet, and lower when the ion current was enhanced
using the negative bias. The data indicate that the excessive absorption of
atomic hydrogen in GaAs is detrimental for the QE. Under atomic hydrogen
irradiation, the native oxides on the surface are converted to more volatile
oxides and get liberated. If the irradiation continues, atomic hydrogen is
absorbed in the GaAs, passivating the p-type dopants in the band bending
region. Since the doping concentration at the surface controls the band
bending, dopant passivation raises the vacuum level, resulting in a lower
QE. Acceptor passivation by hydrogen proceeds through ion pair formation
of negatively charged acceptors and positively charged hydrogen ions. 3 Ions
are more eﬀective than atomic hydrogen at passivating the dopants.

AHC was also performed on bulk GaAs samples without the NH4OH
cleaning. QEs as high as 14% were obtained after 1 hour of AHC (open
square in Figure 1). The sample with native oxides produced a high QE
after prolonged AHC, indicating the oxide layer was protecting the GaAs
surface from impinging atomic hydrogen. 4 This indicates the AHC time
must be optimized depending on the oxide level on the GaAs surface. The
NH4OH etching establishes a reproducible level of native oxides.

are used to control ions: solid circles are no bias and with magnet, squares are no bias
and without magnet, and triangles are with -88 V negative bias without magnet. One
sample (open square) was not cleaned in NH4OH.

Studies at Jeﬀerson Lab 5 indicate that a signiﬁcant depolarization may
occur as a result of long exposures to atomic deuterium. The electron po-
larization was measured in the present experiment as a function of the AHC
time using thin strained photocathodes. The sample was heat-cleaned at
570◦C without AHC and the polarization was measured. Then, a sequence
consisting of 15 minutes of AHC followed by polarization measurements was
repeated four times for the same sample. The AHC was performed with
the magnet and no bias voltage. Figure 2 shows the polarization spectrum
for 1) no AHC, 2) 30 minutes AHC, and 3) 60 minutes AHC. All three
data sets are consistent within the statistical errors. No depolarization was
observed after 60 minutes, which is ∼100 times longer exposure time than
the optimum time, of AHC.

3. Conclusions

Atomic hydrogen cleaning can be used to prepare high-QE GaAs photo-
cathodes at the lower heat-cleaning temperature of 450◦C. Photocathode
quantum eﬃciencies as high as 15% were obtained when hydrogen ions were
eliminated. Extended exposure to atomic hydrogen was found to have no
eﬀect on the electron polarization.

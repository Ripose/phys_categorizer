ABSTRACT

The CAST experiment at CERN (European Organization of Nuclear Research) searches for axions from the sun. The axion
is a pseudoscalar particle that was motivated by theory thirty years ago, with the intention to solve the strong CP problem.
Together with the neutralino, the axion is one of the most promising dark matter candidates. The CAST experiment has
been taking data during the last two years, setting an upper limit on the coupling of axions to photons more restrictive than
from any other solar axion search in the mass range below 10−1 eV. In 2005 CAST will enter a new experimental phase
extending the sensitivity of the experiment to higher axion masses.

The CAST experiment strongly proﬁts from technology developed for high energy physics and for X-ray astronomy:
A superconducting prototype LHC magnet is used to convert potential axions to detectable X-rays in the 1–10 keV range
via the inverse Primakoff effect. The most sensitive detector system of CAST is a spin-off from space technology, a Wolter
I type X-ray optics in combination with a prototype pn-CCD developed for ESA’s XMM-Newton mission. As in other
rare event searches, background suppression and a thorough shielding concept is essential to improve the sensitivity of the
experiment to the best possible. In this context CAST offers the opportunity to study the background of pn-CCDs and its
long term behavior in a terrestrial environment with possible implications for future space applications. We will present
a systematic study of the detector background of the pn-CCD of CAST based on the data acquired since 2002 including
preliminary results of our background simulations.

1. INTRODUCTION

The most sensitive axion helioscope in operation, the CERN axion solar telescope – CAST, aiming to discover the elusive
particle axion, has recently ﬁnished its ﬁrst data taking period. Although no signal over background could be detected by
any of the detectors of CAST during the ﬁrst period of operation, the results from data taken during 2003 allow to improve
the existing upper limit on the coupling of axions to photons to gaγ < 1.16 × 10−10 GeV−1 (for ma < 0.02 eV, see
Fig. 1).1 The axion as a particle is a direct consequence2, 3 of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism4 proposed in 1977 to solve the
still existing strong CP problem. The strong CP problem describes the fact that CP violation in strong interactions seems
not to be realized in nature, albeit the QCD Lagrangian density contains CP violating terms. This inconsistency between
theory and experiment becomes apparent by the fact, that the best experimental limit for the electric dipole moment of
the neutron corresponds to ≈ 10−9 of the range allowed within QCD. As pointed out by several authors, e.g. G. Raffelt,5
axions of a mass in the sub eV range would also be a viable hot and cold dark matter candidate.

If the axion exists, it would couple to two photons with the strength given by the coupling constant gaγ. This coupling
would allow the production of axions inside the hot plasma of stars via the so called Primakoff effect (γγ′ → a), where
photons interact with the coulomb ﬁeld of plasma particles and are converted into axions. The expected axion ﬂux emitted

with g10 = gaγ × 1010 GeV.5 The energy spectrum of the axions would reﬂect the thermal energy spectrum of the photons
in the core of the sun with a mean energy of ≈ 4.2 keV. To detect axions on Earth, Sikivie6 proposed an experimental
approach called the “axion helioscope” which the CAST experiment is based on: in the presence of a transverse magnetic
ﬁeld solar axions could be converted back to observable X-rays via the time reversed Primakoff effect. In CAST we use
a 9 Tesla superconducting dipole magnet for this purpose, providing a homogeneous transversal magnetic ﬁeld inside two
9.26 m long magnet tubes with a diameter of 43 mm each. The magnet is supported by a movable platform that allows
to point the magnet to the sun for 3 h per day (1.5 h during sun rise and sun set). At each end of the magnet three X-ray
detectors (a TPC covering two magnet bores, a Micromegas detector, and an X-ray telescope) are looking for an excess
signal over background in order to detect a possible axion signal. The probability for an axion to be converted to an X-ray
photon in the magnetic ﬁeld depends on the magnetic ﬁeld strength B, the length of the magnetic ﬁeld L, the momentum

During the ﬁrst phase of operation of CAST in 2003–2004 (Phase I) the conversion volume of the magnet was evacuated
(i.e. Γ = 0 and mγ = 0). Then the conversion probability depending on the axion mass remains constant for a given
gaγ and given magnet parameters B and L, as long as the momentum transfer from the axion to the outgoing photon is
negligible or in other words qL ≪ π. The expected integrated X-ray photon ﬂux in the energy range of 1–7 keV is then

rapidly drops and limits the sensitivity of the experiment with the magnet pipes being evacuated. For the end of 2005
it is planned to ﬁll the magnet bore with a refractive medium (4He ﬁrst and then 3He), such that the photon acquires an
“effective” mass and the axion to photon momentum mismatch can be overcome (CAST Phase II). During Phase II, CAST
has the potential to probe regions in the gaγ–ma parameter space that were not reachable for any other experiment so far.
Especially the parameter range that is favored by theoretical axion models (region labeled “axion models” in Fig. 1) can
experimentally be probed for the ﬁrst time with CAST.

In 2003 the three detector systems of CAST have taken useful data for more than 260 h during axion sensitive condi-
tions. In addition, more than 1233.5 h of detector background data were acquired in 2003 with the X-ray telescope under
different operating conditions. This data base, plus 179.4 h of tracking data and 1723.5 h of background data from the data
taking runs in 2004, allow a systematic study of the performance and of the background observed with the most sensitive
detector system of CAST, the X-ray telescope in conjunction with the pn-CCD detector.

2. THE CAST X-RAY TELESCOPE AND PN-CCD DETECTOR

Since the axion to photon conversion inside the magnet tubes conserves the momentum of the incoming axion, the resulting
X-rays would leave the magnet bore as a nearly parallel beam. The divergence is given by the angular size of the magnet
aperture fully covering the axion producing region of the sun. The X-ray ﬂux can then either be observed directly with
a detector mounted to the magnet bore, like it is the case for the Micromegas and TPC detectors, or it can be focused
with an X-ray optics onto a focal plane detector with a high spatial resolution. The advantage of the latter approach is
twofold: in case of a positive signal a telescope system would allow to aquire an image of the axion distribution in the
core of the sun and the focusing of X-rays coming from the magnet bore from an area of 14.5 cm2 to a small spot with
an area of ≈ 6.4 mm2 improves the signal to background ratio and thus the sensitivity of the experiment, signiﬁcantly.
In CAST we realized such an imaging system, consisting of a prototype Wolter I type X-ray telescope developed for the
German X-ray satellite ABRIXAS8, 9 and a pn-CCD detector similar to the fully depleted EPIC-pn focal plane detector
of XMM-Newton.10, 11 A detailed summary on the performance and characteristics of the pn-CCD detector of XMM-
Newton can be found in Ref.12 and references therein. The backside illuminated CCD chip of CAST is operated at a
temperature stabilized at -130◦ C and has a sensitive area of 2.88 cm2 divided into 200 × 64 square pixels, providing a
quantum efﬁciency close to unity between 1–7 keV.

Fig. 2 is a picture showing the interior of the detector, the CCD chip, the cooling mask, and the electronic compo-
nents necessary to operate the CCD. In addition the different detector components are shown as schematic drawings as
represented in the GEANT4 model we use for background simulations. An electronics board is ﬁxed to the rear side of
the CCD, carrying electronic components soldered to the board. The CCD chip itself is glued onto an aluminum oxide
substrate which is sandwiched by a Cu cooling mask from the front and the back, providing a good thermal coupling to the
cold ﬁnger. The CCD chip is surrounded by a passive shield inside the vacuum vessel build of a 10–40 mm thick copper
box made of low activity, oxygen free copper. The copper box is surrounded by a 22 mm thick lead layer free of 210Pb,
followed by additional 2.5 cm of lead outside the vacuum vessel. The detector in this ﬁnal conﬁguration was installed at
the CAST magnet in spring 2004 before the 2004 data taking runs.

2.1. Detector Performance

The pn-CCD detector was operated almost continuously during the data taking periods of CAST in 2003 and 2004. In total
we accumulated more than 2960 h of useful background data during both years, including daily calibration measurements
with an 55Fe source using a ﬂat ﬁeld illumination. This data set allows us to study parameters deﬁning the performance
of the detector in a low background environment over a period of 2 years. The most important detector parameters, the
detector noise averaged over all pixels, the charge transfer inefﬁciency (CTI), the ampliﬁcation (i.e.
the ADU to keV
conversion), and the dark current (offset) averaged over all pixels are summarized in Fig. 3 for the data taking period of
2004. Similar results could be derived for the 2003 data. All parameters except the energy resolution given in FWHM of
the Mn-Kα line and the detector noise show no signiﬁcant variation over the entire period of operation. The increase of
detector noise (mid June and at the end of October) is correlated to an overall increase of noise in the experimental area
of CAST. This change of noise is apparent from the width of the Mn-Kα given as FWHM as well. A degradation of, e.g.
the CTI due to radiation damage defects like it is the case for the CCD detectors of XMM-Newton operated in orbit, is not
expected in a ground based environment.

to the limited time for R&D these components were tested for their natural radioactivity in the Canafranc underground laboratory,10 but
not built from selected and radio-pure materials.

3. THE DETECTOR BACKGROUND

The main contributions to the overall background of the CAST pn-CCD detector is external background induced by cosmic
rays, gamma rays, and radioactive impurities of structural magnet materials. In addition the intrinsic detector background
due radioactive impurities in the detector materials, or the shape of the response function of the pn-CCD can signiﬁcantly
contribute to the total observed background.

3.1. Spectral Distribution

A time averaged background spectrum observed in 2004 under the same operating conditions as during sun observations
is shown in Fig. 4. The axion signal is expected as an excess signal in the energy band between 1 and 7 keV where the
background spectrum has its minimum. The background level in this energy range corresponds to a mean differential ﬂux of
(7.69 ± 0.07) × 10−5 counts cm−2 sec−1 keV−1 which is equivalent to an integral background count rate of 0.1 counts h−1
in the focal spot with an area of 6.4 mm2. The features dominating the background spectrum are ﬂuorescent emission lines
from Au, Cu, and Pb originating in the materials close to the CCD chip on top of a Compton like continuum spectrum
with a slightly negative slope. The Pb lines originate presumably form the “ordinary solder” that was used to fabricate the
electronics board. This solder can be contaminated by e.g. 210Pb. At energies below 1 keV a broad noise peak dominates
the spectrum which is observed in the CERN environment only. This background contribution seems to be caused by the
unusual high electronic noise level in the CAST area compared to controlled laboratory conditions. Since the building
where the CAST experimental area is located, also serves as an electronic support point for the Large Hadron Collider–
LHC and in general was not foreseen and designed as an experimental area from the beginning, the electronic noise level

is unusual high and variable with time. This low energy background component is limited to energies E < 0.8 keV, the
region outside the axion sensitive energy range, and it does not effect the sensitivity of CAST.

3.2. Inﬂuence of the Detector Response Function
Due to secondary energy loss effects in the semiconductor (partial-event effect13), the response of the pn-CCD detector to
mono-energetic photons is not a mere Gaussian, as expected from an ideal detector with a ﬁnite energy resolution, but is
slightly distorted for incident photon energies with E < 6 keV. As an example, a spectrum of monoenergetic X-rays with
an energy of 1.4 keV measured with the pn-CCD detector is shown in Fig. 5. It is apparent, that the Gaussian shaped main
photo-peak is asymmetrically distorted towards lower energies (“Shoulder”) and additional photons are detected equally
distributed between the noise peak and the shoulder of the Gaussian main peak (“ﬂat shelf”). The shape, height, and the
width of the shoulder as well as the ﬂux level of the ﬂat shelf have been determined during the ground calibration campaign
of the pn-CCD detector of XMM-Newton. We refer the interested reader to Ref.13, 14 , for a more detailed introduction
to the partial-event effect and its implications on the spectral response of a pn-CCD. The parameters that deﬁne the shape
of the shoulder and the ﬂat shelf generally are energy dependant. Both effects, the asymmetric shoulder and the ﬂat shelf,
are most distinct for incident photon energies E < 6 keV.14 Due to this redistribution effect especially photons in the ﬂat
shelf could contribute to the overall background, if emission lines are present in the background spectrum. For the CAST
pn-CCD the ratio between hight of the Gaussian peak and the level of the ﬂat shelf (peak to valley ratio) is approximately
2700 for the Mn-Kα line as shown in the right part of Fig. 5. Taking this ratio into account the contribution of redistribution
effects to the low energy background would be two orders of magnitude below the actual level of sensitivity and therefore
is negligible.

Figure 7. Response of the pn-CCD to external γ-ray background. The energy of the incident γ-ray photon versus the number of detected
counts in the 0–7 keV is shown relative to the number of simulated events for different conﬁgurations of the shield. Results are shown
for an unshielded detector, the copper box (int Cu), an additional Pb shield outside the vessel (ext Pb), and an additional Pb shield inside
the vessel being installed (int Pb).

4. BACKGROUND SIMULATIONS

To understand the origin of the background observed with the CAST pn-CCD and to quantify the relative contributions of
different sources of background we made extensive Monte-Carlo simulations with the GEANT4 package. As a ﬁrst step,
a calibration spectrum and the quantum efﬁciency of the CCD were simulated to verify the reliability of the low energy
physical models implemented in GEANT4 and our simulation code. In general, the response on a 55Fe source is very well
reproduced including the area ratio of the Si escape peak to the main emission peak (see Fig. 6). However, the simulated
quantum efﬁciency in the 10–15 keV energy range is slightly higher, than the results from calibration measurements.

4.1. External γ-ray Background

The energy dependant response of the pn-CCD to γ’s with an energy 10 keV < E < 2 MeV has been studied. For the
simulations we assumed a simpliﬁed spherical geometry with isotropic emission for the incident external γ-ray background,
and subsequently different conﬁgurations of the pn-CCD passive shield have been taken into consideration. The integral
number of detected counts in the energy range 0–7 keV originating from high energy γ’s is shown in Fig. 7. From our
results it is obvious that γ-rays with an energy close to 100 keV contribute most to the pn-CCD background and that the
energy dependence of the contribution of the external γ-ray background is low. The Pb shield suppresses mainly γ’s with
an energy above 100 keV, while the copper shield has only a marginal effect on the γ background. From the simulation

we can derive a relative background reduction of a factor of 1.6–2.5 between an unshielded detector and the ﬁnal shield
conﬁguration of the CAST pn-CCD detector, which includes the internal Cu box, the internal Pb shield, and the external Pb
shield. The simulations underestimate the background reduction we have derived from background measurements under
different shielding conﬁgurations, which is a factor of 3 between an unshielded detector and the detector with its full
shield being installed. The reason of this discrepancy might be the simpliﬁcations in the detector geometry we made, the
uncertainties in the response of the pn-CCD to high energy γ’s, and/or the isotropic γ emission geometry assumed for the
simulations. In addition, the background of internal sources in the detector set-up (natural radioactivity) has been neglected
in these simulations.

4.2. External Neutron Background

Similar to the study for the γ-ray background, the inﬂuence of thermal and high energy neutrons on the total background
of the pn-CCD has been evaluated. The energy of the incident neutrons has been varied from 10−2 eV up to 10 MeV. In
Fig. 8 the ratio between events detected in the 0–10 keV energy range of visible energy (taking the quenching factor into
account) and the total number of simulated events as a function of the incident energy of the neutron is shown. The process
that dominates the interaction of neutrons with the detector material seem to be elastic scattering of neutrons off the silicon
nuclei. The resonance visible in Fig. 8 corresponds to a resonance in the neutron elastic scattering cross-section for silicon.
Taking into account the typical neutron ﬂux at sea level15, 16 the differential count rate expected in the pn-CCD detector
from high energy neutron interactions can be estimated to ≈ 6 × 10−6 counts cm−2 sec−1 keV−1, which is below the actual
sensitivity of the detector. Although the spectral distribution of the cosmic-ray induced neutron ﬂux has a maximum at
thermal energies the estimated differential count rate of 3 × 10−8 counts cm−2 s−1 keV−1 originating in thermal neutron
interactions is two orders of magnitude smaller compared to the rates expected from high energy neutrons. Finally we
roughly estimated the muon-induced neutron background, which is around two orders of magnitude lower than the ﬂux of
environmental neutrons.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS

We have presented preliminary results from our study of the background of the pn-CCD detector of CAST. Taking into
account the results of our simulations and background measurements we can conclude that effects due to the non-linear
detector response of the pn-CCD and neutron induced background are negligible and do not contribute to the background
of the CAST pn-CCD detector at the present level of sensitivity. The major contributions to the background seem to be
environmental γ background, internal natural radioactivity of the detector materials, and muon induced background. In
order to quantify these contributions, further simulations based on a reﬁned detector geometry are in progress. Absolute
estimates of the background and the spectral shape of the background are difﬁcult to obtain, especially when the incident
spectrum of, e.g. environmental γ’s is not known. Measurements on environmental background has been performed
recently in the CAST experimental environment and will further help to improve the simulations and modeling of the
background observed with the pn-CCD.

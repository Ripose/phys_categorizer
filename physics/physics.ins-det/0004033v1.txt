Abstract

Neutron detection eﬃciency of superheated drops of Freon-22 for neutrons
obtained from a 3 curie Am-Be neutron source has been reported in this paper.
Although Freon-22 having lower boiling point than many other similar liquids
(e.g.Freon-12, Freon-114, Isobutane ) is expected to be more sensitive to neu-
trons ,it has not been reported so far and therefore this paper constitutes the
ﬁrst report on the subject. Neutron detection eﬃciency of both Freon-22 and
Freon-12 have been determined from the measured nucleation rate using the
volumetric method developed in our laboatory. The result shows that neutron
detection eﬃciency of Freon-22 for the neutron energy spectrum obtained from
an Am-Be source, is almost double, while the life time is 58.6% smaller than
that of Freon-12, for a particular neutron ﬂux of that source.

1. INTRODUCTION

A liquid maintained at the same state above its boiling point is said to be
superheated.
It is a metastable state of the liquid and can be nucleated to form
vapour by the deposition of small energy by ions, charged particles or by any het-
erogeneous nucleation sites such as gas pockets, impurities etc. The superheated
drops,suspended in gel can be used to detect neutrons through the nucleation in-
duced by the recoil nuclei in the medium . The recoil nuclei are produced by collision
of neutrons with the nuclei constituting the superheated drops. The application of
superheated drop detector (SDD) in neutron dosimetry has already been established
(Apfel et al., 1984, 1989; Ing, 1986) and several other potential applications of SDD
in neutron research has been discussed (Apfel, 1979a, 1979b, 1981; Chakraborty et
al., 1990 ). Apfel (1992) has developed and characterised a passive superheated drop
dosemeter using a volumetric technique for neutron monitoring of personnel and in
accelerartor applications. These type of dosimeters are also commercially available
from Apfel Enterprises Inc.,USA. Practical application of the SDD demands that the

1

sample must be reasonably stable against spontaneous nucleation due to background
radiation and other environmental eﬀects, and at the same time as much as possible
sensitive to neutrons with energy spectrum of interest. Among the diﬀerent impor-
tant features of the detector, the systematic quantitative evaluation of the sensitivity
of SDD has been studied for some liquids (e.g. Freon-114, Freon-12, Isobutane, Freon
142B) (Roy et al., 1987) and the response function was reported (Lo et al., 1988).
This paper is an attempt to investigate more sensitive liquid for neutron detection.
Of the liquids investigated so far, Freon-12 is considered to be the most sensitive
liquid for neutron detection. Since the boiling point of Freon-22 is much lower than
Freon-12, we expect Freon-22 to be more sensitive to neutrons than Freon-12. To
the best knowledge of the authors, no such investigation has been reported with
Freon-22. An accurate method of determining the nucleation rate of SDD has been
developed by Roy, et al., (1997b) using a relative manometer. Some other studies on
the neutron detection sensitivity and detector response were made by Ing and Birn-
boim (1984), Ing (1986), Ipe et al., (1988) and Biro et al., (1990). Nath et al.,(1993)
measured the neutron dose equivalent to patients undergoing high energy x-ray and
electron radiotherapy beams using a SDD device. They employed a passive method
for measuring the total volume of neutron induced bubbles by displacing an eqiva-
lent volume of gel into a graduated pipette. The method for the determination of
eﬃciency of detection of neutrons by vapour nucleation of superheated drops using
volumetric method has been developed in our laboratory by Roy et al., (1997a). We
in this work, present the eﬃciency of neutron detection, maximum nucleation rate
and life-time of SDD of Freon-22 irradiated by neutrons from an Am-Be source for a
particular neutron ﬂux and compare it with those of Freon-12. Some of the physical
parameters of SDD of Freon-12 and Freon-22 are presented in table-1. Comparison
is made with Freon-12, since Freon-12 is the most well studied liquid in neutron de-
tection. The paper has been organised to present a brief outline of the method of
bubble formation, description of volumetric method and measurement, results and
discussion.

2. THEORY OF BUBBLE FORMATION

The free energy required to form a spherical vapour bubble of radius r in a

liquid is given by (Roy et al., 1987)

G = 4πr2γ (T ) −

4
3

πr3(pv − po)

(1)

where γ(T ) is the liquid-vapour interfacial tension,Pv is vapour pressure of the super-
heated liquid and Po is the ambient pressure. The diﬀerence pv -po is called the degree
of superheat of a given liquid. One can see from equation (1) that G is maximum at

r = 2γ (T )/(pv − po) = rc

(2)

where rc is called the critical radius. When a bubble grows to the size of the critical
radius it becomes thermodynamically unstable and grows very fast till the entire liq-
uid droplet vaporises. The minimum amount of energy (W) needed to form a vapour
bubble of critical size rc as given by Gibbs (1875) from reversible thermodynamics is

W = 16πγ3 (T )/3(pv − po)2

(3)

which is supplied by the energy deposition dE/dx being the energy deposited
per unit distance travelled by the nuclei in the liquid by the recoil nucleus in a path
length of 2rc inside the droplet.

3. PRINCIPLE OF THE VOLUMETRIC METHOD

The present method utilizes the superheated drops suspended in a dust free
viscous elastic gel. The excess pressure required to form a vapour bubble of diameter
1mm inside this gel matrix is usually less than 1mm of mercury (as observed in a
separate experiment). Hence the volume of the bubble trapped inside the gel and
that at atmospheric pressure are almost equal. This is why the volume change upon
nucleation would be the same whether the bubble formed is trapped inside the gel
or liberated from it. Upon nucleation the increase in volume of the droplet would
displace the trapped air inside a vial containing sample. In the present volumetric
method described in detail in the next section, the measurement of rate of change
of volume has been made using such an air displacement system. The superheated
drops suspended in the gel do not touch each other physically and they nucleate in a
random manner, independent of each other. Under such conditions it can be shown
that the number of the drops and hence the volume of superheated liquid would decay

3

exponentially with time. The rate of change of nucleated volume varies exponentially
with a time constant τ (lifetime). The life time of these droplets in presence of a
neutron ﬂux and the eﬃciency of neutron detection has been studied by measuring
the volume of vapour formed upon nucleation.

If neutrons of ﬂux ψ are incident on superheated drops of volume V, liquid

density ρL and molecular weight M the vaporization rate is given by

where NA = Avogadro Number

d = average droplet volume
ni = number of nuclei of the ith element of the molecule whose

neutron nucleus elastic scattering cross section is σi

η = eﬃciency of neutron detection.

Due to nucleation by neutrons, the change in position (h) of the water column
along a horizontal glass tube which is connected to the sample vial (arrangement is
given in next section), could be measured with respect to time (t). The present set
up is made completely free from any leakage. So the rate of increase of the volume of
vapour during nucleation should be equivalent to the rate of decrease of the volume
of the superheated liquid. So, we have this equation

maximum nucleation rate. The equation (6) has been scaled to per unit mass of the
sample for standardization in making comparison of two samples. Fitting equation
(6) for diﬀerent values of hA
m and t, constants a, b are obtained. Knowing b, the
life time τ (=1/b) in presence of neutron ﬂux ψ is obtained. The neutron detection
eﬃciency η can be found out from equation (8) for a known ﬂux of neutrons

4. EXPERIMENT

The experiment was performed with 3Ci Am-Be neutron source, which has an
energy distribution of neutrons with peak near 3.5 MeV. The source was placed inside
a chamber through which neutrons coming in a ﬁxed range of direction were used to
irradiate the SDDs. Two separate sets of experiments were done with Freon-12 and
Freon-22 respectively at about 30oC and at atmospheric pressure. The superheated
drops are usually suspended in an immiscible gel. The gel that we used here, was
a homogeneous mixture of some ultrasonic gel and glycerol in suitable proportion.
The detail of the preparation of the sample was given elsewhere (Roy et al., 1997b).
The experimental apparatus consists of long glass tube of cross section 0.1573 sq.cm,
placed horizontally on a graduated platform. The tube contained a coloured water
column as an indicator of the volume of the vapour formed on nucleation. One
end of the glass tube was connected to the glass vial containing the sample, by
means of rubber tube. The glass vial and the horizontal tube were at the same
height. So the pressure inside and outside the tube were equal, e.g. both were at
the same atmospheric pressure. Therefore the displacement of the water column of
1 cm length due to nucleation would be directly related to the volume of the vapour
formed. These displacements of the water column along the glass tube were measured
as a function of time. The gamma sensitivity of sample of Freon-22 was tested with
241Am (59.54keV), 60Co (1170keV,1332kev), 137Cs (662keV) gamma sources. The
sample was placed either just in contact or at a close distance to the source. The
sensitivity of the sample for 4.43MeV gamma ray present in 241Am-Be source has
also been tested by substantially reducing the neutron dose.

5. RESULTS

The chemical formula and other physical parameters including critical radius
(rc ) and minimum energy required for nucleation (W) as calculated using equations

5

(2) and (3) respectively, for Freon-12 and Freon-22 have been listed in Table-1. The
experimentally observed variation of volume of vapour formed, hA
m (per unit mass of
the sample) during nucleation as a function of time for Freon-12 and Freon-22 are
shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 respectively. The measured data on rate of nucleation and
life-time of superheated drops of Freon-12 and Freon-22 in presence of neutrons from
a 3 Ci Am-Be source and the eﬃciency of neutron detection are given in table-2. The
samples irradiated by gamma sources did not show any noticeble nucleation at the
experimental temperature.

6. DISCUSSION

From the tabulated results it is seen that the degree of superheat (deﬁned
by the diﬀerence of vapour pressure of the superheated liquid pv and the ambient
pressure po ) attained for Freon-22 at room temperature (30oC) and at atmospheric
pressure is about 38% larger than that of Freon-12. This indicates that in presence
of neutrons the life time of Freon-22 should be smaller than that of Freon-12. Our
experimental results show that the maximum nucleation rate of Freon-22 is about 38%
larger and the life time of Freon-22 is about 58.6% smaller than that of Freon-12 for a
ﬁxed neutron ﬂux from an Am-Be source. As can be seen from the chemical formula
that both of Freon-12 and Freon-22 contain carbon, chlorine and ﬂuorine while Freon-
22 contains one hydrogen replacing one chlorine in Freon-12. The neutron-nucleus
elastic scattering cross-section for Freon-12 is 1.89 barns while that of Freon-22 is
1.69 barns at neutron energy 3.5 MeV. Although the probability of interaction of
a neutron with nuclei of Freon-12 is larger than Freon-22, our experimental results
(table-2) show that the present prepared sample of Freon-22 is about twice as eﬃcient
to detect neutrons than Freon-12. This is due to the fact that as seen from equation
(3), the energy required for nucleation (W) decreases with degree of superheat and as
is evident fron table-1, the saturation vapour pressure of Freon-22 at 30oC is higher
than that of Freon-12, therefore at this temperature Freon-22 will attain a higher
degree of superheat which means a smaller amount of energy deposition is required
for nucleation than that in Freon-12. So, although less number of recoil nuclei are
available in Freon-22 from neutron nuclei elastic scattering, the percentage of nuclei
capable of deposition of energy greater than W for Freon-22 must be larger than
that in Freon-12. As a result the eﬃciency of neutron detection of SDD of Freon-
22 is larger than that of Freon-12. From the experiment with gamma sources it is
clear that the SDD based on Freon-22 is insensitive to gamma at the experimental
temperature. The high eﬃciency of neutron detection and the insensitivity towards
gamma makes Freon-22 a suitable superheated drop detector for neutron detection.

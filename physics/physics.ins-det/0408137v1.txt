Abstract

The HERMES hydrogen and deuterium nuclear-polarized gas targets have been
in use since 1996 with the polarized electron beam of HERA at DESY to study
the spin structure of the nucleon. Polarized atoms from a Stern-Gerlach Atomic
Beam Source are injected into a storage cell internal to the HERA electron ring.
Atoms diﬀusing from the center of the storage cell into a side tube are analyzed
to determine the atomic fraction and the atomic polarizations. The atoms have a
nuclear polarization, the axis of which is deﬁned by an external magnetic holding
ﬁeld. The holding ﬁeld was longitudinal during 1996-2000, and was changed to
transverse in 2001. The design of the target is described, the method for analyzing
the target polarization is outlined, and the performance of the target in the various
running periods is presented.

1 Introduction

The HERMES experiment at HERA (DESY, Hamburg) was designed to study
the quark-gluon spin structure of the nucleon by deeply inelastic scattering
(DIS) of longitudinally polarized electrons from an polarized gas target of
hydrogen and deuterium atoms internal to a storage ring[1,2]. The 27.5 GeV
electron beam stored in the HERA storage ring with currents up to 50 mA
is polarized by the Sokolov-Ternov eﬀect [3], with a time constant of about
30 minutes. A longitudinal spin direction is obtained where the experiment is
located within the HERA east straight section by means of a pair of spin rota-
tors [4]. In a machine with one pair of spin rotators before the 2001 upgrade,
a typical polarization of 60% was achieved.

The HERMES experiment [5] was proposed in 1990, and is designed to run
in parallel with the ZEUS and H1 collider experiments without signiﬁcantly
reducing the electron beam lifetime, which is of the order of 10 hours. This
limits the target areal density to about 1015 H-atoms/cm2 and excludes the
use of any solid target material. A target employing a cold storage cell fed by a
a polarized atomic beam source was proposed and implemented. Polarized gas
targets for storage rings were reviewed recently by Steﬀens and Haeberli [6].

Since 1996, the present target apparatus for polarized hydrogen and deuterium
has been in operation. During the years 1996-97 longitudinally polarized hy-
drogen (H
) was used, while longitudinally polarized deuterium was employed
in 1998-2000 (D
), and from 2002 onwards, transversely polarized hydrogen
(H

) has been in use.

||

||

⊥

Apart from a high areal density and reliable operation over many years, the
most challenging requirement for the internal target was to determine the ef-

4

fective target polarization seen by the beam. The target polarization cannot
be measured by making use of scattering processes involving the high-energy
electron beam due to the small cross sections involved. Nuclear vector po-
larization Pz and, for deuterium also the tensor polarization Pzz were to be
measured, as well as the electron polarization Pe for diagnostic purposes. The
required accuracy was δP = 0.03 absolute uncertainty on the average po-
larization over long measuring periods, and 1 % statistical accuracy within
a couple of minutes in order to monitor possible changes in time. This goal
was achieved by employing a sampling technique in conjunction with detailed
simulations and frequent calibration measurements.

In the present article, an overview of the HERMES polarized hydrogen and
deuterium gas target is given with reference to the various papers describ-
ing the subsystems of the target. The atomic beam source (ABS) [8], the
storage cell [9], the Target Gas Analyzer (TGA) [10] and the Breit-Rabi po-
larimeter (BRP) [11] are summarized in Section 2. Section 3 describes the
analysis applied to the raw TGA and BRP signals and the several calibra-
tions required to derive measured values for the degree of dissociation and
the atomic polarizations of the sample gas 1 . Section 4 reviews the various
physical processes inside the storage cell that directly inﬂuence the TGA and
BRP analyses [12,13,14,15]. The results of the target analysis are reported in
Sections 6 and 7. Section 8 mentions a selection of measurements carried out
by HERMES that crucially depended on the polarized target. The paper is
concluded in Section 9.

2 Survey of experimental apparatus

The HERMES polarized hydrogen and deuterium target, schematically shown
in Fig. 1, consists of an atomic beam source (ABS) that injects a spin polarized
beam of H or D atoms into a thin-walled storage cell. A sample of gas diﬀuses
from the center of the cell into a Breit Rabi Polarimeter (BRP) that measures
the atomic polarizations, or into a Target Gas Analyzer (TGA) that measures
the relative atomic and molecular content of the gas. A magnet surrounding
the storage cell provides a holding ﬁeld deﬁning the polarization axis and
preventing spin relaxation by eﬀectively decoupling the magnetic moments of
electrons and nucleons.

1 In this article, the term “atomic polarizations” refers to the polarizations of the
electrons and nuclei in the atoms

2.1 Target chamber

The target chamber shown in Fig. 2 is evacuated by two turbo-molecular
1. During operation the chamber
pumps with a combined speed of 4400 l s−
7 mbar range due to the high gas load from
pressure is typically in the 10−
the atomic beam, which enters the chamber from 30◦ above the horizontal
plane. The storage cell and its supporting cooling rails are cantilevered from
the upstream 2 end ﬂange.

A 0.3 mm thick stainless steel exit window on the downstream end of the tar-
get chamber allows the scattered electrons and hadronic fragments to leave
the target chamber and to be detected by the HERMES spectrometer [5].
This thin window is integral with the following thin-walled beam tube with
no intervening ﬂange, in order to minimize the high-Z material in this region
and reduce shower production by π0 mesons produced at small angles. About
1 m upstream of the target cell, an adjustable collimator (labeled C1) is lo-
cated to stop direct synchrotron radiation. It normally has the smallest scaled
aperture in the HERA ring, and is opened during electron injection [5]. A
ﬁxed collimator (labeled C2) just upstream of the storage cell protects it from
synchrotron light scattered by by C1 and from exposure to electron showers
from C1.

Fig. 2. Longitudinal target chamber and superconducting magnet viewed from
downstream with respect to the HERA beam direction (left), and from above (right).

For longitudinal running the storage cell and vacuum chamber are immersed
in a longitudinal ﬁeld generated by a superconducting magnet. The magnet
consists of four coils and an iron yoke designed to provide optimum ﬁeld uni-
formity over the length of the storage cell while providing a central gap for the
atomic beam to enter the cell. The magnetic ﬁeld (up to 350 mT) provides the
quantization axis for the spins of the polarized atoms in the storage cell, and
decouples the spins of the nucleons and electrons. The passing HERA beam is
bunched to provide high luminosity for the collider experiments H1 and ZEUS.
As discussed in Sec. 4.2.4, this may induce resonant nuclear depolarization of
the target gas. The induced resonances can be avoided by proper setting of
the holding ﬁeld, provided that its homogeneity is suﬃcient [13]. In the case
of hydrogen, the maximum permissible variation of the magnetic ﬁeld along
the storage cell is 1.5%. For operating with deuterium gas, this requirement
was found to be less critical [16].

2.2 Transverse magnet

After the end of the longitudinal running in 2000, the HERMES target was
modiﬁed for measurements with a hydrogen gas target in a transversely ori-
ented magnetic holding ﬁeld. The intensity of the transverse magnetic ﬁeld
was limited by the amount of synchrotron radiation power generated by the
deﬂection of the beam by the target magnet (5 kW maximum), so it was de-
cided to build a normal conducting magnet. As will be explained in Sec. 4.2.4,

viations of ∆By = 0.15 mT (vert.) and ∆Bx = 0.60 mT (horiz.) have been measured
within the cell volume.

ﬁeld value of about 300 mT was required.

The geometrical constraints imposed by the HERMES acceptance made it
diﬃcult to design a magnet fulﬁlling the uniformity requirement. After con-
struction, the ﬁeld uniformity was measured and improved by shimming the
pole tips. At a ﬁeld strength of B=297 mT, maximum deviations of ∆Bz =
0.05 mT, ∆By = 0.15 mT and ∆Bx = 0.60 mT within the storage cell volume
have been achieved, z being the longitudinal direction, y the vertical and x
the horizontal axis. The magnet was installed in July 2001. The strength of

2.3 The storage cell

×

The HERMES storage cell [9] is made of two 75 µm thin pure aluminum sheets,
which are tightly spot-welded together. It is 400 mm long and has an elliptical
8.9 mm2. All the aluminum parts of the cell are
cross-sectioned shape of 21
coated with Driﬁlm [17] to minimize gas depolarization and recombination
caused by wall collisions [18,19,20,21]. A vented extension of the cell contin-
ues about 147 mm downstream of the cell before joining the thicker-walled
wakeﬁeld-suppressing transition tube, to ensure that all scattered particles
inside the spectrometer detector acceptance pass through the minimum thick-
ness of material (see Fig. 4). The wake ﬁeld suppressors are made of 100 µm
thick titanium, and conﬁne the electromagnetic high frequency ﬁeld of the
bunched HERA beam, forming a gradual electrical transition between the
storage cell and the HERA beam pipe.

×

Cells with three diﬀerent elliptical cross sections have been used thus far. The
8.9 mm2 is the one in use since December 1999, called

9.8 mm2. (A small one (19
a cross section of 29
January 1999 and found to be too small.) Tab. 1 summarizes dimensions and
conductances of the three cells that have been used. The conductance values
apply to gas injected into the cell center.

The storage cell is mounted onto cooling rails, which are cooled by temperature
regulated gaseous helium. The optimum operating temperature for hydrogen
targets was found to be about 100 K, where recombination and depolarization
eﬀects are low. Additionally, the lower conductance at this temperature leads
to a higher target thickness by a factor √3 compared to room temperature.
For deuterium gas the target temperature could be decreased further to about
65 K, which increased the target thickness by about 23 % compared to 100 K.

The temperature of the cooling rails is monitored at three locations by plat-
inum resistors. Since 1999 an additional thermocouple wire has been attached
to the aluminum foil close to the cell ellipse to directly monitor the cell tem-
perature during injection of the HERA beam when a temperature rise of about
5–10 K is usually detected. The cooling rails are mounted on the target cham-
ber ﬂange on the upstream end. Due to thermal contraction of the cell when
being cooled, the position of the cell center changes relative to the atomic
beam source and the Breit-Rabi polarimeter. From room temperature down
to 100 K the cell center moves by 0.9 mm. The alignment of the atomic beam
source and Breit-Rabi polarimeter relative to the cell center includes an oﬀset
to compensate for this eﬀect at the target operating temperature.

The cell is shown along with its support ﬂange in Fig. 4. Two side tubes are
connected to the beam tube, one to inject the polarized atoms and another
smaller one to sample about 5% of the target gas and analyze it in the target
gas analyzer and the Breit-Rabi polarimeter. The sample tube is tilted by
120◦ with respect to the axis of the injection tube to ensure that the sampled
atoms have thermalized with the storage cell wall. A permanent dipole magnet
around the sampling tube outside the target chamber extends the magnetic
holding ﬁeld of the target magnet to prevent depolarization (see Fig. 2). A
capillary near the location of the feed tube allows injection of unpolarized gas
into the cell.

ABS with dissociator and collimator for beam formation. Two sets of sextupole
magnets are located along the beam axis as are the high-frequency transitions. The
axis of the ABS is tilted by 30◦ downwards with respect to the horizontal plane.

2.4 Atomic Beam Source

The atomic beam source [8] consists of a dissociator, a powerful diﬀerential
pumping system, a beam forming system, a sextupole magnet system to focus
atoms with mS = + 1
2 into the storage cell, and adiabatic high-frequency tran-
sitions to manipulate the hyperﬁne population of the atomic beam. Injected
ﬂuxes of ΦABS
1016 atoms/s in the case of hydrogen (2 states) and
≈
ΦABS
1016 atoms/s in the case of deuterium (3 states) have been ob-
served. These values are calculated from the density-dependent spin exchange
relaxation [16]. The injected nuclear polarization P inj
z was constantly above
0.97 for hydrogen and above 0.91 for deuterium. A schematic diagram of the
ABS is depicted in Fig. 5.

Molecular hydrogen/deuterium gas enters the dissociator from the left. The
molecules are dissociated by a radio frequency discharge with a frequency of
13.56 MHz in a pyrex tube, producing a degree of dissociation up to 80 % (H2,
1 and a radio frequency power of 300 W. To
D2) at a ﬂow of about 1 mbar l s−
maximize the stability and the degree of dissociation, an amount of oxygen
between 0.1 and 0.3 volume percent is added to the molecular gas.

A high degree of dissociation at higher ﬂow can potentially be achieved using
a recently developed microwave (MW) dissociator [22], which operates at a
1 and a
frequency of 2.45 GHz. With typical ﬂows between 1 and 2 mbar l s−
microwave power of about 600 W, a degree of dissociation higher than 80 %
is achieved. The MW dissociator was used in the year 2000 when running
with deuterium, when it provided a target thickness improvement of 5–10 %.
The RF dissociator has been used since, because the ABS sextupole system is
not optimized for the lower atomic velocity distribution produced by the MW
dissociator, eliminating the possible beneﬁt for hydrogen.

11

The atomic gas ﬂows through a conical nozzle with an opening diameter of
2 mm, which is cooled to about 100 K. The water produced in the discharge
freezes in the nozzle. Although this beneﬁcially reduces surface recombination,
the ice layer continuously thickens and slowly reduces the gas conductance of
the nozzle. After typically 3–5 days of operation, the pressure in the disso-
ciator tube rises substantially, increasing volume recombination in the tube
and resulting in a noticeable decrease in the degree of dissociation of gas ex-
iting the nozzle. Full recovery is achieved by slightly warming up the nozzle
to remove the ice layer.

After passing the cold nozzle, the gas expands into the vacuum of the disso-
ciator chamber. A powerful diﬀerential pumping system with a total nominal
1 suppresses scattering of the atomic
pumping speed of more than 15000 l s−
beam, and ensures low gas ﬂow into the HERA vacuum system.

The magnet system of the HERMES atomic beam source consists of a total of
ﬁve Halbach type [23] segmented permanent sextupole magnets with a maxi-
mum poletip ﬁeld of about 1.5 T. Every magnet consists of 24 segments of Va-
codym alloy 3 . Four high-frequency transition units are available: two between
the sextupole magnets and two after the last magnet. The system provides
enough ﬂexibility that many diﬀerent combinations of hyperﬁne states can be
injected into the cell. Between the sextupoles, a strong ﬁeld transition (SFT)
and a medium ﬁeld transition (MFT) can be used simultaneously, whereas
the weak ﬁeld transition (WFT) and the SFT after the sextupole magnets
can only be used separately, because they share the coils for the static and
gradient magnetic ﬁelds. The complete set of possible hyperﬁne populations
that can be produced is shown in Tab. 2.

2.5 Target Gas Analyzer

The target gas analyzer (TGA) [10] measures the atomic and molecular con-
tent of the gas extracted from the storage cell through the sample tube. The
TGA arrangement, shown in Fig. 7, consists of a pair of baﬄes, a chopper,
a 90◦ oﬀ-axis quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a cross beam ion-
izer and a channel electron multiplier (CEM) for single ion detection. The
TGA is integrated into the vacuum system of the BRP sextupole chamber,
which is served by two cryopumps and a titanium sublimation pump, with
1. During operation, the pressure in
a total pumping speed of about 7000 l s−
9 mbar. Prior to normal operation, the TGA
the TGA detector is about 4
vacuum chamber is baked with temperatures up to 180 ◦C for 48 hours. The
BRP/TGA vacuum scheme is shown in Fig. 8.

Injection modes of the atomic beam source. The table shows the high frequency
transition (HFT) units employed (2nd and 3rd columns), the hyperﬁne states in-
jected in the target cell and the resulting electron (Pe), nuclear (Pz) and tensor
(Pzz) polarizations in the ideal case of 100 % eﬃciency of the sextupole system and
transition units, no depolarization inside the target cell and inﬁnitely strong guide
ﬁeld. The last column clariﬁes the purpose of each mode (Cal: calibration, moni-
toring; Data: normal HERMES operation). The injection modes for hydrogen and
deuterium single states are listed separately. For some modes the MFT between the
sextupoles has to be tuned as a WFT 1-4. The no state injection mode is possible
only for hydrogen and has been operational since April 2002. The adopted labeling
for the hyperﬁne states is explained in the Breit-Rabi diagram of Fig. 6.

The TGA is mounted 7◦ oﬀ-axis with respect to the BRP, in order to not
interfere with the beam entering the polarimeter. The ﬁrst baﬄe ensures that
only gas from the sample beam can reach the detector, while the second one
acts as a collimator, so that no atoms can hit the metal parts of the ionizer

and recombine. The chopper, placed between the two baﬄes, rotates at a
frequency of 5.5 Hz, thus periodically blocking the sample beam in order to
allow subtraction of the residual gas signal. Particles entering the detector are
ionized by 70 eV electrons, mass ﬁltered with the QMS, and ﬁnally detected
by the CEM. The pulses are counted by a 2048-bin time-resolving counter
(TRC). The bin length is typically set to 175 µs so that two chopper turns are
collected within the whole bin range as shown in Fig. 9. The synchronization
between chopper status and counting rate is given by a trigger signal coming
from the chopper motor. The beam rate is calculated by taking the diﬀerence
between the number of counts collected with the chopper open and closed.

The Breit-Rabi polarimeter (BRP) [11] measures the relative populations ni
of the hyperﬁne states of hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms contained in the
sample beam. From this measurement, the absolute atomic polarizations can
be calculated by applying the knowledge of the target magnetic ﬁeld strength.

Two transition units are used to exchange the populations between pairs of

that can be tuned for both π and σ transitions, and a medium ﬁeld transition
(MFT) unit that can induce various π transitions according to the static ﬁeld
strength and gradient setting used. The sextupole system is composed of two
magnets and spin-ﬁlters the sample beam by focusing atoms with ms = + 1

sures that no atoms in ms =

system was redesigned in the year 2000 in order to improve the transmission
probability at the typical cell temperature. The detector stage is identical to
the one employed for the target gas analyzer: a cross beam ionizer, a quadru-
pole mass spectrometer (QMS) and a channel electron multiplier (CEM). In
contrast to the TGA, only hydrogen (or deuterium) atoms are detected by the
BRP. The chamber residual gas correction is carried out by using a chopper
in the same way as described for the TGA. An additional beam shutter is
placed just after the extension tube exit to measure the possible contribution
of atomic hydrogen coming from the dissociation of H2O and H2 (D2O, DHO,
D2 and DH in the deuterium case) present on the vacuum chamber walls 4 .

4 The beam shutter was installed at the beginning of the deuterium running period
in 1998. During the 1996/’97 hydrogen running period, the contribution of dissocia-
tive hydrogen ionization was taken into account by detecting the intensity of masses
2 and 18 amu in addition to mass 1 amu [16].

3 Analysis of TGA and BRP signals

3.1 Interpretation of the TGA signals

The measured TGA atomic (molecular) signal Sa (Sm) is proportional to the
product of the particle ﬂux Φa (Φm) into the TGA, the mean inverse velocity
of the particles
m ) and the
detection probability ǫa (ǫm). A dependence of the signal on the emission
current is measured and taken into account by the normalization function
f (Iemiss). Taking all parameters into account one ﬁnds:

The total ﬂux ΦT GA of H or D nucleons into the TGA can be related to the
particle ﬂuxes Φa and Φm by:

ΦT GA = Φa + 2Φm.

The TGA geometrical acceptance is such that detected particles have bounced
typically more than 100 times on the extension tube inner surface [16]. For
this reason, particles entering the TGA detector have thermalized with the
extension tube wall, which is a few tens of degrees K warmer than the cell.
For thermalized atoms and molecules one has:

Using eqs. (1), (2) and (3), it can be shown that the partial beam rates Sa and
Sm can be combined to form the variable Stot which is proportional to ΦT GA:

Stot = Sa + κ√2Sm ∝

ΦT GA,

where κ is the calibration constant of the TGA giving the relative sensitivity

Eq. (4) applies to the case of constant extension tube temperature Text and
emission current Iemiss. Taking into account the dependence of Sa and Sm on
the measured 5 Text and Iemiss, one can deﬁne a temperature and emission

The quantity φtot is a good monitor of ABS stability over time, as it is in-

φm, by:

The degree of dissociation αT GA, also called atomic fraction, is displayed by
the TGA roughly once per minute.

3.2 The calibration of the TGA

The purpose of the TGA calibration is to determine the relative sensitivity κ
deﬁned by eq. (5). The calibration can be performed by varying the relative
amount of atoms and molecules at a constant injected ABS total ﬂux:

Because the recombination process in the HERMES target is strongly temper-
ature dependent, a controlled variation of the atomic fraction can be obtained
by changing the temperature of the storage cell. A second possibility is to
take advantage of an accidental beam loss in the region of the HERMES tar-
get which might temporarily change the surface property of the cell and cause
a sharp drop of αT GA followed by a slow recovery. The measured values for κ
are reported in Tab. 3.

A detailed description of the TGA calibration and its performance can be
found in Ref. [10].

3.3 Interpretation of the BRP signals

The atomic signal detected by the BRP depends on the hyperﬁne population
in the sample beam, the transmission probabilities of the sextupole system and
on the setting of the transition units. For a stable storage cell temperature,
the transmission of the magnetic system is ﬁxed. The transition units can be
switched on and oﬀ, changing the intensity of the beam reaching the detector.
The BRP signal can be described by the following expression:

ab describes the exchange of hyperﬁne states by the transition

proportionality factor 7 . The goal of these measurements is to determine the
four (six) sample beam intensities, Ia, for the hydrogen (deuterium) sample

where the measurement matrix Mia includes information concerning transmis-

Assuming that Mia is known, one can solve the system of equations (13) for Ia

in at least four (six) diﬀerent modes in the case of hydrogen (deuterium). The
solution is given by

Finally, the relative hyperﬁne populations na are given by normalizing the
intensities Ia:

The polarizations of the atoms in the sample beam can now be calculated from
the target magnetic ﬁeld strength, as expressed by the following vectorial forms
for hydrogen and deuterium, respectively:

(Pe, Pz)T = M H
(Pe, Pz, Pzz)T = M D

P (n1, n2, n3, n4)T
P (n1, n2, n3, n4, n5, n6)T ,

where the matrices M H

8 If the number of collected signals is larger than the number of unknowns, one has

the intensities Ia to the signals Si.

while the covariance matrix of the polarization vector can be calculated in the
following way:

From CP one can extract the statistical uncertainty of the polarization mea-
surement.

During normal running conditions, the entire automated procedure to measure
and calculate the polarization vectors and their uncertainties took roughly 60 s
(90 s) for hydrogen (deuterium), resulting in a statistical uncertainty of about
0.013 for hydrogen. For deuterium the statistical uncertainty was about
±
0.022 for negative nuclear polarization. After an
0.031 for positive and
±
optimization of the BRP sextupole system, and an increase in the diameter of
the sample tube, the statistical uncertainty of a 60 s measurement for hydrogen
was reduced to less than 0.5 %.

3.4 The BRP calibration

In the previous section it was shown that the atomic polarizations can be
calculated from the measured BRP signals assuming the knowledge of the
measurement matrix Mia. This includes the eﬃciencies of the transition units
and the transmission probabilities of the sextupole system for various hyperﬁne
states. The procedure used to determine these parameters is called the BRP
calibration.

The basic idea of the calibration measurement is to make the system of equa-
tions (13) overdetermined so that additional parameters like eﬃciencies or
sextuple transmissions can be extracted through a ﬁt to the data. Due to the
fact that the transition units can be combined in several possible ways, the
number of signals which can be collected during a polarization measurement
exceeds the number of hyperﬁne states Nhf s. However, the number of un-
knowns that can be determined in this way is still less than the total number
of parameters. The problem can be overcome by cycling this measurement
through several (total number NABS) injection modes (see Tab. 2) so that an
adequate number of signals can be collected.

3.4.1 The transition eﬃciencies

We ﬁrst discuss the method to determine the transition eﬃciencies, assuming
a priori knowledge of the sextupole transmissions σn for each hyperﬁne state.
Calibration of those transmissions will then be discussed in Sec. 3.4.2.

The BRP contains two transition units, a strong ﬁeld (SFT) and a medium
ﬁeld (MFT) unit. The SFT can drive two transitions for hydrogen (
i
and
) and ﬁve for deuterium. The eﬃciencies of the SFT transitions
i
in the case of hydrogen are called εs14 and εs24. The MFT is a multi-step
transition unit which can drive two sub-transitions for hydrogen (

Due to the limited space available for the BRP equipment, there is cross-talk

on, so that the tuning of the MFT is inﬂuenced by the SFT ﬁeld, whereas the
SFT is not inﬂuenced by the (low) MFT ﬁeld. The MFT eﬃciencies have to be
measured separately for each SFT setting, as they depend on the exact static
ﬁeld. For hydrogen this leads to an increase in the number of MFT eﬃciencies
from four to eight. The various MFT eﬃciencies are identiﬁed by means of
the subscripts c14 (for SFT 1-4 static ﬁeld on) or c24 (SFT 2-4 static ﬁeld on)
and by the subscripts r13 or r23 which indicate the particular sub-transition
being considered. For example, the notation εm13r23c24 represents the eﬃciency
of the transition MFT 1-3, step 2-3, tuned together with the static ﬁeld of the
SFT 2-4. The total number of eﬃciencies Nef f is 10 for hydrogen and 41 in
the case of deuterium. The number NBRP of possible BRP signals related to
various transition states is 11 for hydrogen (as shown in Tab. 4) and 29 for
deuterium.

If the ABS is operated in NABS diﬀerent injection modes, and the BRP tran-
sition units switch through all possible NBRP states, the total number of col-
lected signals is Ns = NABS NBRP . In this way, recalling eq. (13), one obtains
a system of Ns equations containing Nu = Nef f + NABS Nhf s unknowns 10 ,
where Nhf s = 4 (6) in the case of hydrogen (deuterium). The system can be
0, where Nf counts the degrees of freedom and is
solved if Nf = Ns −
given by

Nu ≥

Nf = Ns −

Nu
= (NBRP −

Nhf s) NABS −

Nef f .

In such a case, both the hyperﬁne state intensities Ia and the transition ef-
ﬁciencies ε can be determined. For hydrogen, the calibration measurement
makes use of 7 ABS injection modes, resulting in Nf = 39. In the case of
deuterium two possible options have been developed, one with 5 ABS modes
(Nf = 74) and the other with 6 (Nf = 97).

The solution of the system is carried out by applying a Runge-Kutta method
as explained in [11]. The resulting covariance matrix Cx has the form

ciency measurements performed in 1997 with hydrogen. The eﬃciencies of the
transitions for deuterium running can be found in Ref. [11].

3.4.2 The sextupole transmissions

In the previous section it was shown how the eﬃciencies εi of the BRP transi-
tion can be measured, assuming a priori knowledge of the sextupole transmis-
sions σn for each hyperﬁne state. The attempt to ﬁt both εi and all of the σn
within the same algorithm fails. Nevertheless, the transmission probabilities
can be determined by separating the ﬁtting procedure into two steps, as shown
below.

1
In the BRP (Fig. 10), atoms with mS =
2 are either defocused or stopped
by the beam blocker, having therefore zero transmission probability (σ3 =
σ4 = 0 for hydrogen and σ4 = σ5 = σ6 = 0 for deuterium). Moreover, due
to the normalization (eq. (16)), only ratios of transmission probabilities are
required for measuring the hyperﬁne populations. Thus the remaining required
parameters are σ2/σ1 for hydrogen and σ2/σ1 and σ3/σ1 for deuterium.

compared to state

The Stern-Gerlach force of the sextupole magnets is weaker for hydrogen atoms
for magnetic ﬁelds B of the order or less
in state
than the hydrogen critical ﬁeld Bc = 50.7 mT, near the axis of the sextupole
system. Thus near-axis atoms in hyperﬁne states
will experience
a diﬀerent transmission eﬃciency and the transmission ratio r12 = σ1/σ2 is

expected to exceed unity by a small amount. Due to the smaller hyperﬁne
coupling of deuterium, Bc = 11.7 mT, the deviation from unity of the ratio
σ2/σ1 and σ3/σ4, is expected to be signiﬁcantly smaller than for hydrogen.
Ray tracing simulations [8] show that the deviation is in fact negligible. From
these consideration it follows that the only transmission ratio that needs to
be measured is r21 = σ2/σ1 for hydrogen.

From the BRP calibration the transition eﬃciencies are extracted as a func-
tion of the parameter r21. The transmission ratio can thus be evaluated by
minimizing the χ2 of the calibration results. As the transmission probability
of the sextupole system depends on the velocity distribution of the atomic
sample, the storage cell temperature Tcell has to stay constant over the cal-
ibration measurement. This procedure applied to a calibration measurement
taken at Tcell =95 K has produced the following result [11]:

The small uncertainty of the measured ratio can be neglected in the calculation
of the systematic uncertainty of the polarization measurement. The potential
cell temperature dependence of the transition eﬃciencies can be neglected as
the velocity distribution of the sample is ﬁxed by the BRP sextupole system.
Therefore, a polarization measurement performed collecting at least one signal
more than the minimum required number (as is always the case) can be used
to ﬁt the ratio r21 for various cell temperatures.

A more detailed description of the BRP calibration and performance can be
found in Ref. [11].

4 Processes occuring inside the Storage Cell

Inside the storage cell, the atoms of the target may experience several inter-
actions that have an inﬂuence on the average target polarization PT . Their
complete understanding is therefore fundamental for the reduction of the sys-
tematic uncertainty of the target polarization. In this section an overview of
these processes will be given, while a quantitative estimate of their contribu-
tions for the various running periods of the HERMES target can be found in
Sec. 6. The processes are divided into two categories — recombination pro-
cesses and spin relaxation processes.

Recombination and relaxation by wall collisions are surface eﬀects whereas
spin exchange collisions and resonant interaction of beam and target gas hap-
pen in the gas storage cell volume. The operating conditions of the target are
chosen such that these unwanted eﬀects are suppressed as much as possible. It

25

should be noted that spin relaxation can be studied and monitored with good
statistics by means of the BRP, whereas the residual polarization after recom-
bination can be studied only using a scattering process like deeply inelastic
scattering with a much lower rate.

4.1 Recombination Processes

The atoms that are injected into the HERMES storage cell may recombine
to molecules, possibly keeping part of their nuclear polarization. Recombina-
tion [12] can in principle take place either on the storage cell walls (surface
recombination) or in the gas phase (volume recombination). At the low gas
densities of the HERMES target, volume recombination is negligible. On the
cell walls two types of recombination processes with surface catalysis can be
distinguished, which are expected to result in diﬀerent residual nuclear polar-
ization in the molecules:

•

•

the Langmuir-Hinselwood (L-H) process, where two adsorbed thermalized
atoms react with each other;
the Eley-Rideal (E-R) process, where an atom from the gas phase reacts
directly with an adsorbed atom [25].

The residual polarization of the surface atoms recombining through the E-R
mechanism in the cell was measured with the HERMES spectrometer, making
use of a well known DIS asymmetry. The result was presented in Ref. [14] and
will be discussed in section 5.2.

Since the storage cell temperature is usually kept below 140 K, a small amount
of water originating from the ABS dissociator freezes on the surface and grows
into an ice layer on top of the Driﬁlm surface. The presence of water is im-
portant since water is known to inhibit hydrogen or deuterium recombination.
Fresh storage cell coatings are hydrophobic, but secondary particles from the
HERA beam quickly change the chemical structure of the Driﬁlm surface,
causing the surface to become less hydrophobic. This was predicted to occur
in the longitudinal holding ﬁeld by simulations of acceleration by the beam
bunch electric ﬁelds of positive ions produced by the beam in the target gas.
Even when not at cyclotron resonance, the ions stochastically gain energy until
they hit the cell wall with energies of order 100 eV. Surface doses in the range
10 Gy/s can occur, depending on the magnetic holding ﬁeld and the beam
current. Furthermore, the downstream portion of the small cell used since De-
cember 1999 is exposed to synchrotron radiation that is single-scattered from
collimator C1. Fortunately, it has been observed that during normal operation,
the quality of the cell surface gradually recovers and the amount of recombi-
nation in the cell decreases, thanks to the steady accumulation of ice on the

surface.

4.2 Spin relaxation

Three diﬀerent atomic spin relaxation mechanisms can in principle be observed
to occur in the HERMES target, as they cause a change in the hyperﬁne popu-
lation inside the storage cell. One relaxation process takes place on the wall of
the storage cell. Another is due to two-body spin-exchange collisions of atoms
in the gas phase. In the third mechanism the high frequency ﬁelds generated
by the passage of the very short HERA beam bunches can cause a depolar-
ization in the target atoms under certain conditions [13]. Spin relaxation of
atomic hydrogen by wall or spin exchange collisions with various types of wall
coatings has been under study for many years in the context of a hydrogen
maser for low holding ﬁelds [6]. For the HERMES target further studies of
the magnetic ﬁeld dependence of spin relaxation as well as studies of the tem-
perature dependence and density dependence of the transition spectra have
been carried out [16,30,31,32,33]. The results of these studies are summarized
in the following sections.

4.2.1 Wall relaxation

The atoms injected by the atomic beam source experience several hundred wall
collisions during their diﬀusion process through the storage cell. An attractive
Van-der-Waals potential between the storage cell wall and a diﬀusing atom
causes the atom to be physisorbed, i.e. to stay for a certain time close to the
surface until it is desorbed again. The mean residence time on the wall τs is
described by the Arrhenius equation:

Eb
kT

τs = τ0 e
(cid:16)

,

(cid:17)

(25)

where τ0 is the high temperature limit of τs, Eb and T are the adsorption energy
and the temperature respectively, and k is the Boltzmann constant. During
10 s for the HERMES
the time an adsorbed atom stays on the wall (
cell), the magnetic moment of its unpaired electron interacts with magnetic
moments on the surface by means of a dipolar coupling and/or with other
unpaired electrons through exchange interactions [18,19,20,21]. Depending on
the surface type, temperature and magnetic ﬁeld, one can deﬁne a probability
that the atom leaves the wall in a certain hyperﬁne state. This is described by
means of transition probabilities Wjk, each of which represents the probability

4.2.2 Spin Exchange Depolarization

Atoms colliding with each other in the gas phase can undergo spin exchange,
where hyperﬁne transitions can occur via interaction between the electron
spins [34]. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, the sum of the
magnetic quantum numbers mF before and after the spin exchange collision
has to be the same:

relaxation by means of spin exchange is possible. This is actually not the case
for the HERMES cell, where to double the density, more than one atomic state
is injected during normal operation. The eﬀect of spin exchange collisions on

to determine the density inside the HERMES cell [16]. The results will be
reported in Sec. 6.

4.2.3 Master equation for the description of the spin relaxation process

The various spin relaxations due to wall collisions and spin exchange collisions
cannot be treated separately. After an interaction with the surface during a
wall collision, an atom in the gaseous phase can then interact through spin ex-
change collision and, at the next wall collision, interact again with the surface.
Since the atoms are constantly exposed to both interactions, an appropriate
description is given by a so-called master equation for the occupation numbers

Fig. 11. Measured hyperﬁne population vs. magnetic ﬁeld for hydrogen for the
various injection modes. The measured values are given by symbols, while the lines
show a ﬁt using the solutions of eq. (28)

The ﬁrst two terms of eq. (28) represent the incoming and outgoing ﬂuxes, the
third term the wall relaxation and the last term the spin exchange relaxation.
The eﬀect of recombination is not included in this formula. In eq. (28), three
time constants appear: τd (the diﬀusion time) is the occupation time of atoms
within the storage cell, τf is the time of ﬂight between two wall collisions
and τse is the time between two spin exchange collisions. For times that are
large compared to τd the hyperﬁne population converges toward a dynamic
equilibrium (steady state). The solution of the linear system of equations in
the steady state was solved directly in the case of hydrogen or with the help
of a numerical iteration algorithm in the case of deuterium [16]. As an exam-
ple of the application of eq. (28), Fig. 11 represents the measured hyperﬁne
population as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld for hydrogen and a ﬁt to the
data using the solutions of eq. (28). The ﬁtted parameters are the three time
constants and optionally the injected atomic state populations. The W and M
matrix elements are calculated on the basis of theoretical models [16]. These
data show that a holding ﬁeld greater than 300 mT is needed to have sizable
polarization for the case of two injected states.

4.2.4 Bunch ﬁeld induced depolarization

The beam of the HERA electron storage ring is bunched with time period
τbunch = 96.1 ns between two adjacent bunches. Typically, most of the 220 RF
buckets are ﬁlled, so that the bunch frequency is given by:

νbunch =

= 10.42 MHz .

(29)

A large number of harmonics contribute to the induced magnetic high fre-
quency ﬁeld close to the HERA beam, because the bunches are very short
(σ = 30 ps). The transition frequency between two hyperﬁne states
and

νij =

.

−
h

(30)

If νij matches one of these harmonics at a certain holding ﬁeld B, resonant
depolarization occurs. The location of the beam-induced resonances is shown
in Fig. 12. Bunch ﬁeld induced depolarization at the HERMES target has been
studied in the cases of hydrogen [13,33] and deuterium [16] for the longitudi-
nal orientation of the target holding ﬁeld (before 2001). During this time the
observed π (∆m =
1) transitions were suﬃciently well separated so that at
the working ﬁeld (335 mT) no beam induced depolarization could be found.
In the case of the transverse ﬁeld that has been in use since October 2001,
both σ (∆m = 0) and π (∆m =
1) transitions are allowed because the os-
cillating ﬁeld surrounding the HERA beam has components both parallel and
perpendicular to the static holding ﬁeld. The spacing between two adjacent
resonances is narrower than in the longitudinal case (only 0.37 mT diﬀerence
in the magnetic holding ﬁeld at B = 0.3 T), so a better homogeneity in the
holding ﬁeld is needed (see Fig. 12).

±

±

Thus a transverse ﬁeld value for which beam resonant depolarization can be
completely suppressed does not exist. A pair of additional correction coils
mounted closely around the storage cell to improve the ﬁeld homogeneity was
installed for the 2003 running to further reduce resonant depolarization. The
results will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

5 Target polarization

The average polarization PT of the nucleons in the target is a fundamental
parameter of the HERMES experiment. The problem is to relate the measured
atomic polarizations in the sample beam with the density-weighted average
polarization of the nuclei in the cell. The determination of the target polar-
ization involves several terms that mainly account for two eﬀects:

•

•

Presence of molecules in the cell, both unpolarized from the residual gas of
the scattering chamber and/or directly injected from the ABS, and polarized
molelcules coming from recombination of polarized atoms on the cell surface.
Relaxation and recombination eﬀects in the storage cell leading to an inho-
mogeneous distribution of the atomic fraction and of the atomic polariza-
tion.

The average target polarization PT as seen by the electron beam is given by
the following equation:

PT = α0αrPa + α0(1

The values for α0, αr and Pa are calculated using the measurements of the
TGA and BRP combined with various calibrations. As both detectors measure
the properties of a sample of the target gas from the center of the target cell,
it is necessary to relate the results to a corresponding value averaged along
the storage cell. This is achieved by evaluating the sampling corrections [15]:

The sampling corrections and their systematic uncertainties are functions of
the measured values of αT GA
, respectively. The functions depend
on the geometry of the storage cell, its surface properties and the detectors’
acceptances. They are calculated with the help of Monte Carlo simulations
of the stochastic motion of particles in the storage cell, where the histories
of these particles are stored and analyzed. Another possibility is to calculate
sampling corrections analytically by describing the diﬀusion process of the
target gas inside the storage cell with the use of a one-dimensional diﬀusion
equation. The issue was addressed in Ref. [15] and will be discussed here in
Sec. 5.4.

The various quantities entering the calculation of the average polarization are
summarized in Tab. 6.

32

5.1 Determination of the quantities αr and α0

In order to calculate the target polarization following eq. (31), it is necessary
to separate the atomic fraction α0 that would be seen by the HERA electron
beam if no cell wall recombination were to occur and the fraction αr of the
initially injected atoms that survive wall recombination, as seen by the HERA
electron beam. The measured quantity αT GA can also be factored in two terms
and can be written as (see eq. (9)):

αT GA =

φa
φa + φm

= αT GA
0

αT GA
r

.

(34)

Since dissociative ionization can be neglected [10], the only source of atomic
ﬂux φa into the gas analyzer is that originating from the atomic beam source.
The molecular ﬂux φm may come from three diﬀerent sources:

•

•

•

Undissociated molecules ballistically injected by the ABS. Since the eﬃ-
ciency of the dissociator is around 80 %, a signiﬁcant number of molecules
pass through the nozzle towards the polarizing stage, aﬀected by neither the
sextupole magnets nor the transition units. Although the majority of these
molecules hit the vacuum chamber wall and are pumped away, a small num-
ber enter the storage cell via the injection tube. These unpolarized molecules
have a triangular density distribution along the cell axis, with the maximum
density at the center of the cell.
Rest gas in the target chamber. These molecules originate mainly from the
recombination of atoms that have left the storage cell and have thermal-
ized on the vacuum chamber walls. This molecular component is clearly
unpolarized and results in a uniform density component inside the storage
cell.
Atoms that recombine into molecules while in the cell. As explained in
Sec. 2.3, the cell material and temperature are optimized in order to limit
the depolarization and recombination eﬀects in the target atomic gas. Never-
theless, atoms can stick on the cell surface and recombine, and the resulting
molecules may carry a residual nuclear polarization.

The normalized total molecular ﬂow rate φm of atoms into the TGA ionizer
can be decomposed in the following way:

φm = φbal + φrg + φr ,

(35)

where φbal, φrg and φr represent the ballistic, the rest gas and the recombina-
tion components, respectively. To separate between polarized and unpolarized
molecules, we rewrite the two factors in eq. (34) using the three contributions
appearing in eq. (35):

33

φa
φa + φr

,

αT GA

r ≡

αT GA

0 ≡

φa + φr
φa + φr + φbal + φrg

.

(36)

(37)

The independent measurement of each of the three components of the total
molecular ﬂow rate is accomplished by means of routine target calibrations,
which are usually performed between two HERA electron ﬁlls when the HER-
MES spectrometer is not taking data. The rest gas contribution φrg to the
molecular ﬂux is linearly proportional to the pressure in the target chamber.
The constant of proportionality is determined by injecting into the target
chamber increasing quantities of hydrogen (deuterium) molecules with a con-
trolled ﬂow system and by measuring the corresponding TGA count rates. The
ballistic ﬂux contribution φbal can be measured by varying the atomic ﬂux of
the injected beam while keeping the molecular ﬂux constant. The atomic ﬂux
is changed by using the hyperﬁne transitions to select either 1 or 2 (or 3 in the
case of deuterium) hyperﬁne states. Since the recombination probability in-
side the cell was found to be independent of the injected beam intensity [12],
the quantity φbal can be extracted. Eq. (35) is then solved for the remain-
ing molecular ﬂux φr. After the molecular contributions φrg, φbal and φr are
extracted, one can determine αT GA
using eq. (36) and thus αr using eq. (32)
with the sampling correction cα determined as described in Sec. 5.4. A detailed
description of how these calibrations are performed was given in Ref. [10].

r

The factor α0 is deﬁned in terms of the nucleon thicknesses ta,r,bal,rg in the cell
seen by the HERA beam:

α0 ≡

ta + tr
ta + tr + tbal + trg

.

(38)

It can be determined without reference to additional sampling corrections. All
the φi terms in eq. (37) represent nucleon ﬂuxes. Let us deﬁne a proportionality
constant c representing the TGA response to atoms through the relationship
φa = cta. The ﬂuxes φr, φbal and φrg are suppressed by a factor of √2 due to
the smaller molecular velocity, leading to φr = ctr/√2 and φbal = ctbal/√2.
Furthermore, in the limiting case of small cell wall recombination, the densities
of atoms and molecules producing ta, tbal and tr are triangular. In contrast,
the rest gas producing trg has a uniform density along the cell, resulting in
φrg = ctrg/(2√2). If the diﬀerence between the conductances of the atoms and
molecules is neglected so that they have the same distributions along the cell,
the above considerations can be combined to give

α0 =

φa + √2φr
φa + √2(φr + φbal + 2φrg)

.

(39)

34

However, this diﬀerence in conductances can be taken into account [16,24],
leading to diﬀerent distributions along the cell and a more complicated ex-
pression:

α0 =

d(φa + φr)
d(φa + φr) + √2(φbal + 2φrg)

,

(40)

where d = √2/(1 + (√2

1)αr).

5.2 Relative polarization β of nuclei in recombined atoms

As mentioned in the previous sections, some of the polarized hydrogen or
deuterium atoms may recombine in the storage cell. A direct measurement of
the remnant polarization contained in the molecules is not possible at HER-
MES, as the Breit-Rabi polarimeter can measure the atomic polarizations
only. Atomic recombination is a surface-mediated temperature-dependent pro-
cess [12,16]. Hence measurements of the nuclear polarization of recombined
atoms using storage cells of various materials and/or with various coatings
[37,38] are not directly applicable to the HERMES case. Without any infor-
mation about the polarization β of nucleons in molecules (or molecular polar-
1.
ization in short) one has to allow in eq. (31) the conservative range 0
A set of data taken in 1997 at a higher cell temperature (260 K instead of
the nominal 100 K) was used to measure β for hydrogen at that temperature,
resulting in β260 K = 0.68
0.06syst [14]. This result can be used as an
0.09stat ±
upper limit for β at 100 K (β100 K
high ) under the following assumptions. The main
mechanism responsible for recombination at 100 K and 260 K is the same (i.e.
the E-R mechanism) [12]. At 100 K, the recombination probability is smaller
than at 260 K, because the atoms impinging from the volume have less kinetic
energy to overcome the activation barrier. The residence time of chemically
adsorbed atoms on the surface at 100 K is greater than at 260 K, and their
possible polarization cannot exceed the value measured at 260 K. This results
in β100 K

high = 0.83.

±

≤

≤

β

The lower limit for β100K (β100K
low ) can be derived from a simple argument. By
assuming that the nucleon spins are not aﬀected by the recombination process,
the nuclear polarization of the molecule at the time of its formation (P 0
m) can
be evaluated by taking the average value of the polarization of an atom coming
from the volume (P a) and one resident on the surface (P s). The theoretical
lower limit for β100K can then be inferred by supposing that atoms sticking
on the cell surface are totally depolarized (P 100K,low

5.3 Injected atomic polarizations

a

An important parameter for the evaluation of the target polarization is the
injected atomic polarization P inj
(i.e. the nuclear polarization of atoms in the
absence of depolarization), as it enables the separation of the various spin-
relaxation eﬀects. The injected polarization for each ABS operating mode
(Tab. 2) can be calculated if the transmission probabilities of the sextupole
system and the eﬃciencies of the adiabatic transition units are known. The
sextupole transmission probabilities for hydrogen and deuterium have been
calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation and the results are given in Ref. [8].
The injected polarization is fairly insensitive to these values. The eﬃciencies
of the transitions of the ABS can be extracted by measuring the magnetic
ﬁeld dependence of the spin relaxation processes and by ﬁtting the data with
a theoretical model described in Sec. 4.2.3 and given by eq. (28). For normal
operation, the important ABS injection modes are those having a large positive
or negative nuclear polarization, Pz+ and Pz
respectively, and, in the case of
deuterium, the two additional positive and negative tensor polarization (Pzz+
and Pzz

) modes (see Tab. 2).

−

−

−

For hydrogen, only two transitions after the sextupole system are used: the
SFT 2-4 for Pz+ and WFT 1-3 for Pz
. Therefore, the injected polarizations are
directly given by the transition eﬃciencies whose values have been extracted
in Ref. [16] with the technique mentioned above, and cross-checked using a
more direct method based on the symmetry of the spin relaxation processes
for the two injection modes. In the case of deuterium, several transition units
are used to provide the four polarizations, some of which are located between
the two sextupole subsystems. Hence, the injected polarizations have to be
calculated taking into account the transition eﬃciencies as well as the trans-

36

mission probabilities for atoms whose hyperﬁne state gets changed between
the two subsystems.

The calculated polarization for the hydrogen and deuterium beams injected
into the target are summarized in Tab. 7. The degree of nuclear polarization
injected by the ABS when running with deuterium is substantially lower than
for hydrogen. The reason is that, due to the higher number of hyperﬁne states,
the deuterium nuclear polarization can be achieved only by using the transition
units located between the two magnetic subsystems, resulting in an incomplete
separation of states.

5.4 Sampling Corrections

r

) and cP (P BRP

The sampling correction functions cα(αT GA
) depend strongly
on the distribution of recombination and wall relaxation probabilities per wall
collision along the storage cell. For a freshly produced storage cell which has
not yet been exposed to the HERA beam, one can assume that the recombi-
nation and wall relaxation probabilities are constant over the entire surface of
the storage cell, or at least that microscopic inhomogeneities due to various
types of surface sites are equally distributed. Possible mechanisms by which
the HERA beam could aﬀect the surface properties of the storage cell include:

a

•
•

•

•

desorption of the surface coating by synchrotron radiation;
bombardment of the storage cell walls with charged particles leading to
radiation damage;
chemical reactions of ionized hydrogen or deuterium radicals with the cell
surface;
redistribution of the ice layer on the storage cell by RF heating due to the
wake ﬁelds;

contamination of the storage cell surface by sputtered material from the
collimator upstream of the target.

Under normal operating conditions no inﬂuence of the HERA beam on the
target performance has been observed. Nevertheless certain distinct incidents
aﬀecting the cell have been observed, when the beam tune was not optimal
or the HERA beam was accidentally lost near the HERMES target region.
Since the eﬀect of the HERA beam on the surface properties is poorly known,
every realistic distribution of recombination and wall relaxation probabilities
has to be considered when evaluating the sampling corrections. It is therefore
convenient to distinguish certain scenarios of special interest.

•

•

•

Homogeneous cell (HC): the natural assumption for a freshly produced
cell not yet exposed to the HERA beam. The calculated sampling corrections
and P BRP
set an upper limit for αr and Pa for any given values of αT GA
,
respectively.
Homogeneous beam tube (HBT): the main cell tube is homogeneously
aﬀected by the beam, while the side tubes are unaﬀected.
Inhomogeneous beam tube (IBT): The main cell tube is inhomoge-
neously aﬀected by the beam, while the side tubes are unchanged. This
scenario does not lead to a single sampling correction, but it can be used
to calculate a lower limit for αr or Pa for any given value of αT GA
or P BRP
,
a
respectively.

a

r

r

A model for calculating the sampling corrections was developed in Ref. [16].
It is based on a parameter γr(γd), the recombination (spin-ﬂip) probability
during a wall collision. If these probabilities were constant and equal for the
beam and sample tubes, the sampling corrections would depend only on their
geometry. This is actually the case for a freshly installed cell, whose Driﬁlm
coating is known to be intact and uniform. In all scenarios it is assumed that
the relation γST
γBT
holds at any time for the recombination probabilities
r
, and beam tube, γBT
in the sample tube, γST
. The validity of this hypothesis is
proven by the data [16,24]. The numerical calculations of the sampling correc-
tions have been performed using a molecular ﬂow simulation, complemented
by analytic calculations based on the one-dimensional diﬀusion equation [16].

r ≤

r

r

The sampling correction cP must be subdivided into two terms, one for the
wall collisions and a second term for spin exchange relaxation, as the two
processes must be treated in diﬀerent ways. This can be done by deﬁning the
depolarization factors Dwd (wall collisions) and Dse (spin exchange relaxation)
so that for small spin relaxation, one has:

cP ≡

Pa
P BRP

Dwd Dse P inj

As the spin exchange relaxation occurs in the gas phase, and for the typical
values of αr > 0.9 the atomic density distribution is little aﬀected by any
change of the cell surface properties, the relation between Dse and DBRP
is
similar for all of the listed scenarios. Moreover, since calculations have shown
[16], one can conclude that the sampling correction cP is
that Dse ≃

As an example, in Fig. 13 the eﬀect of the calculated sampling corrections for
the large-aperture cell used in the 1996-97 running with hydrogen is shown.
During normal operation, the values of αT GA
are found to be almost
always well above 0.9, so that local linear approximations may be ﬁtted to the
calculated sampling corrections:

their systematic uncertainties ∆¯a and ∆¯b are taken to be the diﬀerences found
when ﬁtting the extremes.

5.5 Evaluation of the systematic uncertainty in PT

After having determined all the terms of eq. (31), PT can be expressed as
a function of the measured quantities. It is convenient to write the target
polarization in the following way:

6 Performance

In the present section an overview is given about the target performance in
the running period 1996-2003, by analyzing distinct periods for each target:

1997 for the longitudinal hydrogen target;
2000 for the longitudinal deuterium target;
2002 for the transverse hydrogen target.

6.1 Longitudinal hydrogen running in 1997

The upper plot in Fig. 14 shows the atomic fraction αT GA measured by the
target gas analyzer during the 1997 running period. The nuclear polarization
of atoms measured by the BRP is plotted in the lower half of Fig. 14. Aside
from startup problems, the target performance was relatively smooth. Unfor-
tunately, a severe HERA beam loss close to the HERMES region occurred at
a certain point (left line), resulting in a change of the cell surface properties.
After this bad event, it was decided to collect a set of data at higher tem-
perature (Tcell = 260 K instead of the nominal value Tcell = 100 K) in order
to measure the β parameter (see Ref. [14]). At the end of this period, the
storage cell was exchanged (middle line). Also the second cell experienced a
beam loss (right line) which produced a small hole in the cell wall. For these
reasons, the analysis of the 1997 dataset was divided into four periods, during
each of which the cell surface condition was assumed to be constant. For each
period, speciﬁc studies have been performed to limit the uncertainties on αr
and Pa [24].

For the entire running period with hydrogen, we quote a luminosity-weighted
0.033 and a
average value for the target polarization of Pz+ =

6.2 Longitudinal deuterium running in 2000

Over the eight month period of deuterium running in 2000, the HERMES tar-
get operated under very stable conditions. The atomic beam source, equipped

42

a
with a microwave dissociator, experienced only one major failure, which hardly
aﬀected data accumulation. Neither the scattering chamber nor the TGA/BRP
vacuum system had to be opened, leading to constant amounts of residual gas
in the storage cell as well as stable eﬃciencies of the detectors monitoring the
target. There was no need to replace the storage cell, as its performance in
terms of atomic recombination and nuclear depolarization was always excel-
lent. The reason for such good behavior can be found both in a particularly
fortunate Driﬁlm coating and in the limited damage caused by a very well
tuned electron beam, i.e. no unwanted beam losses in the vicinity of the tar-
get.

The outstanding performance of the HERMES target in this period is well rep-
resented in Fig. 15 (note the change in scale compared to Fig. 14). The stable
behavior of the cell surface in terms of atomic recombination is demonstrated
in the upper plot of Fig. 15, where the atomic fraction measured by the target
gas analyzer is plotted. The lower plot shows the nuclear polarization. In the
period between January and June 2000, the target was operated with only
positive and negative states of nuclear vector polarization, implying positive
tensor polarization. From July on, a new injection mode combining vector
and tensor polarization Pz+, Pz
was established in order to
perform the ﬁrst measurement of the tensor-polarized structure function bd

The polarizations measured by the BRP were found to be consistent with
those calculated as described in Sec. 5.3, within the uncertainties.

6.2.2 Recombination

Although atomic recombination depends strongly on temperature, no variation
of the measured atomic fraction αT GA over a very wide temperature range
around the working temperature Tcell = 60 K was ever observed during the
whole year. Fig. 17 (upper plot) reports a cell temperature scan performed
in August. (For comparison a temperature scan performed with hydrogen in
1997 is also shown in the lower plot of the same ﬁgure). Additionally the
measurement of the fraction αT GA
of atoms surviving recombination yielded
the following average value:

conﬁrming that within the measured uncertainty no evidence of recombination
was found. Therefore, for the deuterium operating period in 2000, both the
deviation from unity of the sampling correction cα, and the impact of the
uncertainty in β are negligible.

6.3 Transverse hydrogen running in 2002

During the 2002-2003 operating period, the HERMES transversely polarized
hydrogen target worked in a very stable way. On the other hand, the poor
performance of the HERA beam did not allow a detailed study of the bunch
induced depolarization. Nevertheless, by scanning the target magnetic ﬁeld a
working ﬁeld value was established where the loss of polarization due to the
ﬁeld non-uniformity was limited to 1.5 % at the highest available beam currents

running periods. A comparison between the longitudinally polarized hydrogen
and deuterium target leads to the following conclusions. At the same guide

are suppressed by a factor (BH

there is a clear diﬀerence. This is due to the larger number of eﬃciencies and
transmissions involved.

From the table it is possible to deduce departures from the optimal perfor-
mance like the amount of recombination (∆αr = 1
αr), and the depolar-
ization due to the various depolarizing mechansims: spin-exchange collisions
(∆PSE), wall-depolarization (∆PW D) and beam-induced ﬁelds (∆PBI ). The
target density integrated over the cell length, or areal density t, is also shown
together with a relative factor of merit (FOM) that takes into account both
the polarization and the density. It is worthwhile to mention again that in
9.8 mm) implying a
1997 the target cell had a larger cross-section (29 mm
higher conductance and a correspondingly lower density (about 40 %). The
table also illustrates once more the optimal performance of the D
target in
2000. For this target no recombination (∆αr = 0) and no depolarization phe-
nomena (∆PW D = ∆PSE = ∆PBI = 0) have been observed. This excellent
behavior has to be attributed to the lower critical ﬁeld of deuterium (11.7 mT)
compared to hydrogen (50.7 mT), and to an improvement in the knowledge
and preparation of the cell surface coating. The improved surface coating is
also responsible for the better performance of the 2002 H
target compared
to the 1997 H

target, as far as the amount of recombination is concerned.

ing a loss in polarization of about 11 % and limiting the gain in the factor of
merit with respect to the 1997 running due to the increase in density. This
indicates how an enhancement in the ﬁgure of merit of the target might be
obtained by increasing the holding ﬁeld proportionally with the density, in
order to limit the spin relaxation eﬀects.

8 Selected HERMES results

In this last Section before the conclusions, some of the measurements which
have been carried out at HERMES with the polarized internal gaseous target
during the various running periods are mentioned. The number of deeply in-
elastic scattering events (after data quality selection) collected with the three
polarized targets is given in Tab. 9.

Among the measurements which have been performed using the HERMES
detector, we quote the following few: the measurement of the gp
1 structure
function [39]; the measurement of the gd
1 structure function [40]; the ﬁrst mea-
surement of the bd
1 structure function [41]; measurements of the quark-ﬂavour
decomposition of the nucleon spin [42,43]; the ﬁrst measurements of single-spin
asymmetries in deep-inelastic scattering oﬀ both longitudinal and transversely
polarized targets [44,45,46] and a ﬁrst study of the gluon polarization in nu-
cleons [47].

9 Conclusion

The HERMES polarized hydrogen/deuterium target has been reliably operat-
ing since 1996. It provides polarization values between 0.78 and 0.85, densities
1014 nucleons/cm2, and total systematic uncertainties of only 0.03-0.04.
1-2
The systematics of both the recombination and depolarization processes in
the storage cell are fully under control.

Investigations of interactions of intense relativistic electron beam with single crystal have
resulted in observing electron beam intensity eﬀect in radiation [1], i.e. non-linear anoma-
lous radiation. One can think nature of that is connected with synchronization of atomic
Coulomb-ﬁelds, which means creating strong ﬁeld for ultra-relativistic electrons passing
through the oriented crystal. This eﬀect is manifested stronger on the edge of crystal.
Apparently, other electromagnetic process-pair production is modiﬁed also. Main causes for
such phenomenon is exciting of the crystalline medium and spatial asymmetry on the crystal
edge. We propose to create polarized photon beams at the end of bremsstrahlung spectrum
by means of both diﬀerent ways on the base of obtained results [1]:
1. Electrons entering this strong ﬁeld emits intense beam of photons with high degree of
polarization [1], as one is synchrotron -like radiation [2]. According to [2] increase of ﬁeld
strength will result in displacement of photon peak to ωc ∼ γ3/R (where γ-Lorents-factor of
electron, R- curvature radius) nearly to electron primary energy. Such ﬁeld on the crystal
edge can be received if to use narrow very intense electron beam. However at working with
tagged photon the high intensity electron beam can not be used. In this case X-ray tube or
laser can excite crystal.
2. High energy unpolarized photon beam entering mentioned strong ﬁeld of oriented crystal
will be converted to electron-positron pairs with diﬀerent cross-sections in depending on
orientation of crystalline planes relative to direction of linear photon polarization. One can
receive then linear polarized photon beam using bremsstrahlung at the end of its spectrum.
However in contrast to known method of selective absorption the degree of photon beam
polarization can be higher in case of excited crystal. Let us consider such a possibility more
in detail. Production of electron- positron pair in ﬁeld of atomic nucleus is process reverse to
bremsstrahlung, as it is other cross-channel of bremsstrahlung process. It means eﬀect inten-
sity must be manifested also at pair production in oriented crystal. However in this process
minimal longitudinal momentum transfer to nucleus δ = 2/ω [3] (where ω - photon energy)
is more than in bremsstrahlung Therefore the more energy of photon the more cross-section
of pair production. So arising large diﬀerence of pair production cross-sections in excited
oriented crystal in depending on the direction of linear photon polarization with respect to
the crystalline planes can result in desired results. In paper [4] was shown the growth of
radiation cross-sections with electron beam intensity. One can expect appropriate growth at
pair production. Then one can carry out experiment [5] with more thin corundum crystal,
varying exp(−σ⊥ · t), responsible for photon absorption (where σ⊥- growing cross-section, t-
crystal thickness) to ensure high degree of the photon beam polarization and gamma beam
intensity.

One can use mentioned phenomenon for increasing analyzing power of linear polarized
gamma rays using single crystal by analogy of Cabibo method [6] However passing of high-
energy gamma rays through crystal do not accompany with high excitation of crystal, as it
takes place in case of electrons. That is way X-ray tube or laser is necessary here.

Artiﬁcial birefringence arises in crystal in fact when pair production cross-section depends
on orientation of linear photon polarization with respect to crystalline planes. Then excited
single crystal of appropriate thickness can be used also as the high-energy analogy (showed
by Cabibo [7]) of a quarter wavelength plate to convert linear polarized photon beam into
circular one.

All subjects touched on this paper present an interest for spin physics therefore they are

needed in further experimental investigations on appropriate accelerators.

Abstract

We have developed a completely new type of general-purpose CCD data acquisition
system which enables one to drive any type of CCD using any type of clocking
mode. A CCD driver system widely used before consisted of an analog multiplexer
(MPX), a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and an operational ampliﬁer. A DAC
is used to determine high and low voltage levels and the MPX selects each voltage
level using a TTL clock. In this kind of driver board, it is diﬃcult to reduce the
noise caused by a short of high and low level in MPX and also to select many kinds
of diﬀerent voltage levels.

Recent developments in semiconductor IC enable us to use a very fast sampling
(∼ 10MHz) DAC with low cost. We thus develop the new driver system using a
fast DAC in order to determine both the voltage level of the clock and the clocking
timing. We use FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) to control the DAC. We
have constructed the data acquisition system and found that the CCD functions
well with our new system. The energy resolution of Mn Kα has a full-width at
half-maximum of ≃ 150 eV and the readout noise of our system is ≃ 8 e−.

1 Introduction

Most recent X-ray satellites carry a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera for
their focal plane instrument. CCD’s possesses a moderate energy resolution,
a high spatial resolution, and a timing resolution. The Solid-state Imaging

Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint

2 February 2008

Spectrometer, SIS, onboard ASCA was the ﬁrst CCD camera used as a photon
counting detector. (Tanaka et al[1]). Following the SIS, many satellites such
as HETE2 (Ricker[2]), Chandra (Weisskoph et al.[3]), XMM-Newton (Barr et
al.[4]), and MAXI (Matsuoka et al.[5]) now carry a X-ray CCD camera on
their focal planes.

MAXI, Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image, has been selected as an early payload
of the JEM (Japanese Experiment Module) Exposed Facility on the Interna-
tional Space Station. MAXI will monitor the activities of about 2000-3000
X-ray sources. It consists of two kinds of X-ray detectors: the ﬁrst, the gas slit
camera (GSC) is a one-dimensional position-sensitive proportional counter,
and the other, the solid-state slit camera (SSC) is an X-ray CCD array. The
CCD used in the SSC is fabricated by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK)
and is being calibrated both at Osaka University and the National Space De-
velopment Agency of Japan (NASDA).

Since SSC is the ﬁrst CCD camera fabricated soley by Japan, we need to
specify the functioning of the CCD in detail. In order to optimize the function
of the CCD, we need to develop a highly ﬂexible data acquisition system.

2 Requirements for New System

In order to optimize the X-ray responsibility of the CCD, we need to develop
a highly ﬂexible CCD driver. Our requirements of the CCD driver are:

• to output any kind of clocking pattern
• to dynamically control clocking voltages
• to modify the clocking pattern easily and download it by request
• to have a readout speed ≥ 1MHz
• to output clocking voltages with a range of −20 to +20 V
• to control voltage levels to within 0.1 V

The clock driver circuit used until now consists of MPXs, DACs (digital-to-
analog converters), and analog ampliﬁers. For example, two DACs are used to
generate the low and high voltage level of a clock and an MPX switches each
level with a digital signal. This system has been well established but it is not
suitable to change the voltage level dynamically.

3 New CCD Data Acquisition System

To satisfy all of the requirements listed in section 2, we have developed a
new type of CCD driver system as shown in ﬁgure 1. We use one fast DAC
to generate each clock. This enables us to control each clock with a high
ﬂexibility whereas we need a lot of control I/O pins. In the previous system,
the voltage level of each DAC is determined before operating the CCD and
at least one I/O pin is needed for each clock. On the other hand, our new
system requires the number of clocks times 10 pins per DAC even if we use an
8-bit DAC, resulting in roughly orders of magnitude more I/O pins than the
previous system. We thus introduced a ﬁeld programmable gate array (FPGA)
to control all DACs.

3.1 Design of the DAC board

Because a CCD is operated by DACs directly, the noise characteristics need
to be low. We therefore picked up more than ﬁve DACs to evaluate the noise
characteristics. Among them, TLC 7524 fabricated by Texas Instruments pos-
sesses the lowest noise characteristics and we select this device for our new
system.

A detailed design around DAC in ﬁgure 1 is shown in ﬁgure 2. We use a photo-
coupler, HCPL−2430, to separate an analog and a digital ground. TLC7524 is
an 8-bit current-output DAC whose settling time is ∼ 100 ns. The fast settling
time enables us to simultaneously control both the clocking timing and the
voltage level, which is realized with several DACs and MPXs in the previous
driver system. Thus, our new system posses a high ﬂexibility though it is much
simpler than the previous system.

3.2 Design of the FPGA board

We previously used the VME system to control the DAC boards and had a
lot of noise problems mainly due to a switching regulators on a VME power
supply unit. We thus abandon using the VME system for this purpose. We
designed a general-purpose digital I/O board (DIO board) to simultaneously
control several DAC boards. Our DIO board carries a reconﬁgurable FPGA,
512 Kbyte SRAM device (PD434008ALE-15), a serial interface, a parallel
interface with 10 bits, an interface for a liquid crystal to display the status,
and eight DAC interfaces. One DAC interface possesses 10 bits in order to
control a 10 bit DAC in a future application. Figure 3 shows a photograph of
the FPGA board developed in this work. We selected an Altera Flex 10K50 for

3

the FPGA. This FPGA device is a static memory type that can be reconﬁgured
simply with a command and has 189 pins available for the user.

One of the remarkable advantages is the development of Hardware Description
Language (HDL). HDLs and synthesis tools can greatly reduce the design
time, improving the time-to-market. A description based on HDLs is easier
to understand than some schematic for a very large design in FPGA gate
format. There are several kinds of HDLs developed for various corporations:
AHDL[7], VHDL[8], and Verilog-HDL[9]. Among them, we employed VHDL.
Throughout the development, we used the MAX+PLUS II and FPGA Express
software provided by Altera corporation and Synopsis corporation.

3.3 Data Acquiring System

The CCD output signal is processed with a delay line and peak-hold circuits
which have been previously developed by our group. The processed signal
is shifted to ± 5V and sampled by a 12-bit analog-digital converter (ADC).
Digital data are transferred to the VME I/O board ([6]) with a ﬂat cable and
are sent to the sparcstation through the VME bus.

3.4 Sequencer

We have developed a sequencer and relevant software to compile it. We deﬁne
two sequencers: V-ram and P-ram. The V-ram deﬁnes a voltage pattern to
drive the CCD with a relatively a short duration. Combining several V-rams,
we describe the clocking pattern for readout of whole CCD in P-ram.

3.4.1 V-ram

We develop, typically, two kinds of V-ram: V-ram for readout one pixel and
transfer one line. An example of V-ram for one pixel readout in a two phase
CCD is shown below. The vertical axis represents the time sequence. P1H
and P2H are clocks for the serial register and P1V and P2V are those for the
vertical register. RST and HOLD are clocks for reset and ADC. Numbers in V-
ram represent the voltage level in units of Volts. Following brackets show that
a voltage level is the same as the previous value. In this way, we describe the
voltage level and the timing for a voltage change in V-ram.

The V-ram compiler we developed reads the V-ram and creates the DAC
patterns for each clock. The HOLD signal is transferred to the ADC board

4

through the parallel interface while others are transferred to the appropriate
DAC interace.

In the current system, we use TLC7524 which needs a reference clock. When
the reference clock is sent to TLC7524, it latches all data bits and outputs the
voltage depending on the data bits. Since the reference clock is diﬃcult to be
described in V-ram, the V-ram compiler adds it in the output sequencer code
automatically.

3.4.2 P-ram

P-ram is described to deﬁne the readout of a whole CCD. To include V-ram
ﬁles, P-ram uses the ﬁlename of V-ram. We have prepared several instruction
commands to describe any P-rams easily and concisely as listed in table 1.
Combining ﬁlenames of V-rams and instruction commands, P-ram can be
easily developed by the user. One example of a P-ram is shown below.

set A = 64
set B = 2
set xaxis = 1024
set yaxis = 1024

start:

do yaxis

set wait A

5

seq 1 vertical
set wait B
seq xaxis horizontal

end do

jmp start

This P-ram reads out a CCD with 1024 × 1024 pixels. V-ram of ’vertical’
and ’horizontal’ deﬁne the voltage pattern to transfer pixels vertically and
horizontally, respectively. The instruction of ’set wait’ is to determine the
duration of each level in S-ram.

The P-ram is compiled on a SUN sparcstation (Force, CPU-50GT) and stored
in the memory of VME I/O board. After sending a command from the sun,
P-ram is downloaded to the DIO board by means of the serial interface and
stored in the memory of the DIO board.

3.5 Conﬁguration of the Circuit in FPGA

To realize the function of the sequencers, we divided the conﬁguration of the
FLEX device into ﬁve blocks as shown in ﬁgure 4. Each block is constructed by
a synchronous state machine. The Serial Interface is the interface to the
VME I/O board to download sequencers. After loading sequencers, the Serial
Interface sends a trigger signal to the Clock Controller. The state ma-
chine of the Clock Controller is shown in ﬁgure 5. The Clock Controller
is in the idle state until a trigger signal is sent. Once the trigger signal is
received, the Clock Controller moves to the memory check state, where
the Clock Controller sends the memory address and a trigger signal to
the Synthesize Pattern. The Synthesize Pattern sends a trigger signal
to the Memory Controller and receives memory data. After repeating three
times, the Synthesize Pattern arranges the data into 96 bits and sends it
to the Clock Controller. Then, the state moves to fetch where 96 bit data
is stored in a register and next moves to decode. In the decode state, the
Clock Controller analyzes the bit pattern based on the instruction com-
mands shown in table 1 and sends DAC patterns to the appropriate DAC in-
terface. After sending the DAC patterns, the memory pointer is incremented
and Clock Controller waits for the wait parameter (A or B shown in P-ram).
In each state, the Clock Controller sends status information to the Display
Controller and the Display Controller controls the liquid crystal to dis-
play the clocking status.

4 Performance

4.1 Driver System

In order to demonstrate the performance of our new CCD driver, we produced
5 value clockings as shown in ﬁgure 6. This kind of multi-level clocking is
eﬃcient to reduce the spurious charge[10]. We thus conﬁrm the high potential
and high ﬂexibility for our new system.

Since we use 8 bits DAC for each clock, we can control a voltage level within
≃ 0.1 V. We normaly operate the DAC boards with ranges of −15 to +15V.
If we change the resister of R13, R15, and R20 in ﬁgure 2, we can output the
clock up to +20V or down to −20V.

The readout speed is limited by the number of state machines to read a voltage
pattern from S-ram. In our current design, there are 13 steps to fetch a 96 bits
voltage pattern, resulting in the maximum clocking speed to be ≃ 300 KHz.
We still need to optimize it in order to meet our requirements (∼ 1 MHz).

4.2 Total System

We compared the performance of our new system with the HPK C4880 system,
which is an X-ray CCD data acquisition system previously used[11]. We used
a CCD chip fabricated by HPK. We cooled the CCD down to −100◦C and
irradiated it with an 55Fe source. For comparison, we set the same readout
speed as that of C4880 (50 KHz). We selected the ASCA grade 0 events[12]
with a split threshold of 90 eV and ﬁtted the histogram with two Gaussian
functions for Mn Kα and Kβ. Results are shown in table 2. The readout noise
of our new system is ≃ 8e−. We can conﬁrm that our new system function
much better than the previous system.

5 Summary and Future Developments

We have developed a new type of general-purpose CCD data acquisition sys-
tem which enables us to drive any kind of CCD with any kind of clocking
and voltage patterns. It functions well and demonstrates great ﬂexibility. We
found the readout noise of the CCD to be 8 e− rms in our system, which might
be contributed to by our readout circuit rather than a CCD chip itself.

We plan to develop the analog electronics to process a CCD output signal

7

to reduce the readout noise. The system currently used is a delay line cir-
cuit which has poorer performance than an integrated type circuit for both
readout speed and for noise characteristics (especially high frequency regime).
Therefore, we will develop an integrated correlated double sampling circuit in
the near future.

We also plan to replace the VME I/O board with another FPGA board which
has already been constructed by us. On this board, 80M sampling ADC, FLEX
10K and 4Mbyte S-ram are mounted. There are three IEEE 1394 ports each of
which has a capability of 400 Mbps connection. Large amount of memory gives
us to extract X-ray events before sending raw frame data to the host machine.
Since FPGA has a good capability of a parallel processing comparing with
DSP or CPU, it enables us to analyze data in real-time. It is also important
to develop onboard digital processing software using HDL for future X-ray
astronomy missions.

We will calibrate the CCD for the MAXI mission with our system. We need
to determine the voltage pattern and the voltage level to optimize the X-ray
responsibility.

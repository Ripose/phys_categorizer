Abstract

The HERA-B Outer Tracker is a large system of planar drift cham-
bers with about 113 000 read-out channels.
Its inner part has been
designed to be exposed to a particle ﬂux of up to 2 · 105 cm−2s−1, thus
coping with conditions similar to those expected for future hadron col-
lider experiments. 13 superlayers, each consisting of two individual
chambers, have been assembled and installed in the experiment. The
stereo layers inside each chamber are composed of honeycomb drift
tube modules with 5 and 10 mm diameter cells. Chamber aging is pre-
vented by coating the cathode foils with thin layers of copper and gold,
together with a proper drift gas choice. Longitudinal wire segmenta-
tion is used to limit the occupancy in the most irradiated detector
regions to about 20 %. The production of 978 modules was distributed
among six diﬀerent laboratories and took 15 months. For all materi-
als in the ﬁducial region of the detector good compromises of stability
versus thickness were found. A closed-loop gas system supplies the
Ar/CF4/CO2 gas mixture to all chambers. The successful operation
of the HERA-B Outer Tracker shows that a large tracker can be eﬃ-
ciently built and safely operated under huge radiation load at a hadron
collider.

Introduction

HERA-B is a ﬁxed target experiment using the 920 GeV proton beam of
the HERA electron-proton collider [1, 2]. Proton-nucleus interactions are
produced using an internal wire target in the halo of the proton beam which
allows for concurrent operation with the ep collider experiments. The design
of the experiment was driven primarily by the physics goal of studying CP
violation in the decay B0 → J/ψK 0
S , requiring high event rates and particle
ﬂux, eﬃcient particle identiﬁcation and triggering.

The HERA-B spectrometer, schematically shown in Fig. 1, covers in the
bending plane an angular range from 10 mrad to 220 mrad, corresponding
to about 90 % solid-angle coverage in the center-of-mass system.
The main components of the spectrometer are the following:

3

• The halo target station [3] consists of two sets of 4 wires, separated
along the beam by 5 cm. This allows to localize the vertices of proton-
nucleus interactions at very high rates of up to 40 MHz with 4 to 5
interactions per proton bunch. Most data were taken using carbon and
tungsten targets, but for the study of A dependencies other materials
such as titanium and aluminum have been used as well.

• The vertex detector system (VDS) [4], based on silicon strip detector
technology, starts at 1 cm radius from the beam. The detector consists
of 8 superlayers extending over a length of 2 m along the beam. This
allows a stand-alone pattern recognition of tracks and the reconstruc-
tion of both interaction and decay vertices.

• The normal-conducting dipole magnet for momentum analysis has a
ﬁeld integral of 2.2 Tm. The magnet aperture is 160 mrad vertically
and 220 mrad horizontally.

• The main tracking system consists of detector components with dif-
ferent granularities and technologies varying with the distance from
the proton beam pipe. To limit the occupancy of detector cells and to
minimize the number of channels, the tracking system is divided into
an inner and an outer part. For the Inner Tracker (ITR) [5] microstrip
gas chambers with a gas electron multiplier (GEM) foil are used cov-
ering the regions between about 6 cm and 20 to 25 cm from the beam
axis. The strip pitch is 300 µm. The Outer Tracker (OTR), based on
drift chamber technology, will be discussed in this paper.

• The particle identiﬁcation system includes the ring imaging Cherenkov
counter (RICH) [6], the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) [7] and
a muon identiﬁcation system (MUON) [8]. The latter two are also
used to trigger on e+e− and µ+µ− pairs from J/ψ decays as well as
on leptons from semileptonic decays.

The detector is optimized to run at interaction rates up to 40 MHz and
to deal with up to 200 charged particle tracks every 96 ns. This results in
a high radiation load, comparable to conditions at LHC experiments. To
guarantee that the detector components sustain a running period of about
5 years, extensive aging studies for most of the components were performed
[9].

A selection of the decay mode B → J/ψK 0

S requires a trigger system
which reduces the background by a factor of about 105. The HERA-B
detector with its trigger and data acquisition system is ﬂexible enough to
access a wide range of additional physics topics like B production cross
section, heavy-quark physics, J/ψ and Υ production mechanisms as well as
minimum bias physics. Detailed descriptions of the HERA-B detector and
its capabilities are given elsewhere [1, 2, 10].

In the following sections we will discuss the design and construction of
the Outer Tracker with emphasis on the drift chamber modules, the assembly
of the detector, and the gas system. The OTR electronics and the detector
performance are described in separate papers [11, 12].

2 General Design Aspects

2.1 Detector Requirements

The design of the Outer Tracker and the choice of technology is driven by
requirements of the physics program, space constraints in the experimental
area, cost optimization, and feasibility of large-scale production. The OTR
is designed to serve the following purposes:

• Eﬃcient reconstruction of charged particle tracks from a distance of
20 cm from the HERA proton beam up to the outer acceptance limit
of the experiment.

• Precise momentum measurement together with the vertex detector

system and the dipole magnet.

• Providing fast trigger signals for the ﬁrst level trigger (FLT) in the

environment of high track density.

• Tracking inside the magnet to provide vertex and momentum infor-

mation of K 0

S mesons decaying in the magnet.

These demands require an OTR detector with good performance in terms
of rate capability, spatial resolution, and hit and tracking eﬃciencies. It also
requires a fast drift gas, for which an Ar/CF4/CO2 mixture was chosen. In
addition, the amount of material in the tracking detector has to be small to
minimize eﬀects of bremsstrahlung, photon conversion, multiple scattering,
and hadronic interactions.

2.2 Particle Rate and Occupancy

One of the most important requirements is the high rate capability of the
OTR. At 40 MHz interaction rate the detector has to deal with about 100
charged primary and secondary particles per proton bunch. The radial de-
pendence of the particle ﬂux is ≈ 108/R2 particles per second. Here R
denotes the radial distance from the proton beam (Fig. 2).

In the inner part of the OTR, at R = 20 cm, the hit occupancy in an event
is almost 2 % per cm2 of the detector cross section. The occupancy drops by
two orders of magnitude in the outer region at R = 200 cm. Eﬃcient pattern
recognition of all charged tracks and the FLT tracking of charged leptons
demand detector occupancies of less than 20 %. For higher occupancies the

rate of misreconstructed tracks increases and both, pattern recognition and
tracking on the FLT level become ineﬃcient. High occupancies require a
high detector granularity and this inﬂuences strongly the choice of detector
technology and read-out electronics. Compared with previous and existing
experiments occupancies of 20 % are very high.

2.3 Global Outer Tracker Design

The Outer Tracker system consists of three diﬀerent parts:

• Magnet Chambers (MC) for tracking inside the magnetic ﬁeld,

• Pattern Recognition Chambers (PC) in the ﬁeld-free region between
the magnet and the RICH for track reconstruction and for triggering,

• Trigger Chambers (TC) for the tracking of leptons in front of the

ECAL and for triggering.

The track reconstruction requires a suﬃcient number of hits measured
in each of the three tracker parts. As shown in Fig. 1, the Outer Tracker
comprises 13 so called superlayers (7 MC, 4 PC and 2 TC) each of which is
vertically divided into two chambers. Each chamber is an independent device
with its own gas and power connections and its own read-out electronics
system.

In order to allow a 3-dimensional track measurement, all superlayers but
MC5 are combinations of three types of stereo layers with wires at angles of
0, 80 and -80 mrad w.r.t. the vertical direction. The small stereo angle helps
to suppress hit ambiguities during pattern recognition, at the expense of an
increased spatial resolution in the vertical direction. Table 1 summarizes for
all superlayers the position of the front plane, the dimensions and the layer
structure.

A viable technology for building a tracking detector with the speciﬁed
dimensions are drift tubes, where each anode wire is located in the center of
a cathode tube made of a thin conductive foil. Compared to drift chambers
with cathode wires, drift tubes oﬀer several advantages: Due to the much
lower electric ﬁeld on the cathode it is easier to avoid aging eﬀects, single
broken wires are less dangerous for the functionality of the whole detector,
and the tubes are mechanically self-supporting. The last fact makes it easy
to group drift tubes in modules. The module size can be chosen to best ﬁt
the requirements of detector mass production and assembly.

Tracking in a high occupancy environment beneﬁts from drift cells being
as small as possible, but the operational safety of the detector sets a lower
limit on the cell size. For the Outer Tracker a minimal drift tube diameter of
5 mm is chosen. Due to the 1/r2 dependence of the particle rate, tubes with
double diameter (10 mm) can be used in the outer parts of the detector.

Figure 3: Segmentation of modules in an OTR detector plane. Modules with
5 mm cell size (grey) are segmented in up to four sectors (sector numbers 1
- 6). Modules with 10 mm cell size (white) have one or two sectors (sector
numbers 7 - 12). Segmented modules are read out from top and bottom.
The thick black line indicates the mechanical separation of the two chambers
forming a superlayer.

This helps to minimize the channel count.

According to Fig. 2, there are up to 0.02 particles/cm2/bunch in the
innermost area of the OTR. Because the cell occupancy is required to be
smaller than 20 %, the maximum cell length would be limited to 20 cm for
5 mm cells. Since the vertical dimension of the OTR ranges from 75 to
450 cm, the only solution is a longitudinal cell segmentation. The technical
realization is described in section 3.1. In Fig. 3 the composition of a detector
plane from individual detector modules and the segmentation into diﬀerent
sectors is shown schematically. Except for the outermost sectors 11 and
12, the anode wires are separated in the middle to obtain two independent
parts of a cell, read out from top and bottom.
In addition, 5 mm cells
are segmented into inner sectors (3 - 6) with 20 cm long anode wires and
outer sectors (1 and 2) with wire lengths of 25 - 205 cm, depending on the
superlayer.

At the HERA-B detector, the HERA proton and electron beam lines are
separated. The proton beam axis deﬁnes the central HERA-B detector axis.

Figure 4: Schematical view of the module frontend composition and the
basic elements building up a drift cell module.

The electron beam pipe also passes through the detector. To minimize the
dead area around the beam pipes and to allow an easy access, the superlayers
are divided into two asymmetric chambers, where the separation follows the
positions of the two beam pipes (see Fig. 3).

3 Detector Modules

3.1 Design Aspects

As was described in the previous section, the Outer Tracker is assembled
from modules of drift tubes with 5 or 10 mm diameter and walls made of a
light-weight conductive plastic foil. Instead of building modules from indi-
vidual tubes, a honeycomb structure of hexagonal drift cells is constructed
layer by layer from appropriately folded foils. The main advantage of this
technology is the possibility to assemble the anode wires into open cells.
This makes it easy to implement the longitudinal anode wire segmentation
shown in Fig. 3.

Prototypes of drift chambers consisting of honeycomb cells with 15 mm
cell diameter have been developed for the muon detector of the ATLAS
experiment [13, 14]. Tests using conductive soot-loaded polycarbonate foil
[14, 15, 16] and an automated folding device [13] showed that cells with only
5 mm diameter could be produced as well.

The assembly steps are indicated in Fig. 4. One can see the ﬁrst wired
cell layer before gluing the upper foil on the lower one to form a so-called
monolayer. The simplest fully eﬃcient detector plane, a so-called single
layer, consists of two staggered monolayers, as shown in Fig. 5. Single layer

9

Figure 5: Schematical view of the single and double layer module cross
sections.

modules are used for detector planes which are not implemented in the
trigger. They have no segmentation in case of 10 mm cells (sectors 11 and
12 in Fig. 3) and for modules with 5 mm cells installed above and below the
proton beam pipe. The 10 mm modules of sectors 7 to 10 are divided into
an upper and a lower part. The double layer structure shown in Fig. 5 is
used for two classes of modules. First, it is needed to build 5 mm modules
with 4 sensitive sectors (labelled 1-3-4-2 and 1-5-6-2 in Fig. 3). The details
of the single layer structure for such a module are shown in Fig. 6, where
also the longitudinal wire segmentation is described.
In the second class
of double layer modules both single layers have the same structure. This
creates sensitive sectors with double coverage, where the logical OR of lined-
up wires can be used to increase the hit eﬃciency. All OTR layers used in
the FLT are of this type.

3.2 Module Types

The large-scale manufacturing of modules for superlayers of diﬀerent struc-
ture and dimensions requires a detailed planning and preparation. To min-
imize the number of diﬀerent module types identical heights are chosen for
the four PC and for the two TC superlayers (see Tab. 1). So-called standard
modules with 5 mm drift cells are deﬁned to have 32 cells per monolayer,
which is a multiple of the 16 channels per signal read-out board [11]. For
modules with 10 mm cells there are 16 cells per monolayer. This results in
a module width of about 30 cm and is also a reasonable size for the compli-
cated and heavy production templates (see Section 3.4). Another advantage
is that even the 4.5 m long TC modules weigh only 1.5 kg and are light
enough for an easy handling during manufacturing and for the installation

10

Figure 6: Structure of a standard 5 mm module providing four sensitive
sectors. The lower single layer has one sensitive area with 25 µm anode
wires in the left part which is directly connected to the high voltage board.
The other sensitive area is in the inner right part, which is read out from
the right side via 75 µm thick (non-sensitive) wires. The structure of the
upper single layer is complementary.

into the superlayers.

The complete Outer Tracker contains 978 honeycomb drift tube modules.
Two thirds of these have drift cells with 5 mm diameter. In total, 148 types
of modules with diﬀerent widths, lengths, and internal structures had to
be produced. There are 25 types of standard modules, just diﬀering in
length and/or drift cell size, which account for half the modules in the
detector. Non-standard modules are needed mainly in the overlap of the
two chambers of a superlayer, and around the proton and electron beam
pipes. A few examples of module cross sections are shown in Fig. 7. With
the trapezoidal module cross section, the cells of neighbouring modules are
overlapping. As shown in Fig. 8 for 5 mm and 10 mm modules this overlap
avoids an eﬃciency loss.

3.3 Module Components

As shown in Fig. 4, a module essentially consists of cathode foils, wire sup-
port strips, anode wires in the sensitive part and of end-pieces and base
plates on both module ends for the ﬁxation. The components and materials
used in the module production will be described in more detail in the fol-
lowing. In Table 2 the product names, the producer and the approximate
amount of all materials are summarized.

Cathode Foil: The cathode foils form the honeycomb structure of the
drift cells and ensure the mechanical stability of the modules (see cross sec-
tions in Fig. 5). To minimize secondary interactions in the detector, the
cell walls must be as thin as possible. A conductive foil type developed by
Bayer [15], commercially available from the company LONZA [16], has the
required properties which are summarized in Table 3. However, prototype
modules built from this foil showed severe aging when operated at HERA
[17]. This was caused by insuﬃcient surface conductivity of the foil [18]. Af-

ter detailed investigations, the problem could be solved by metal-coating of
the foil. Using a plasma coating process, the foils were covered with a 50 nm
thick copper and a 40 nm thick gold layer [20]. Copper alone is corroded by
the ﬂuoric radicals created by gas ampliﬁcation in the Ar/CF4/CO2 drift
gas mixture, and a direct gold coating has not suﬃcient adhesion on the
Pokalon-C surface.

The ﬁrst step in foil mass production was the folding of about 12000
foils of 1 m length and 40 cm width. The device and the folding procedure
are described in detail in [13]. The folded foils are then tempered between
two aluminum templates for about 20 minutes at a temperature of 120◦ C.
In this way an accurate hexagonal shape with straight cell sides is obtained.
The last step is the copper and gold coating of the foil surfaces.

Base Plates: The base plates are glued to both module ends (see Fig.
4). They have accurate holes for the positioning and slits for the ﬁxation
of the module in the superlayer frame. The material is an epoxy/glass
ﬁbre multilayer (FR4) with very good mechanical properties and excellent

chemical resistance. The plates are 70 mm wide to allow the mounting of
high voltage boards, which provide the anode wires with high voltage and
transfer the anode signals via twisted pair cables to the ampliﬁer-shaper-
discriminator (ASD-8) boards located outside of the gas box [11]. In order
to reduce the amount of material, no base plates are used at the inner end
of modules above and below the proton beam pipe.

End-Pieces: The end-pieces (see Fig. 4) are plastic parts produced by a
mould injection technique. In the ﬁrst cell layer the end-pieces are glued
onto the foil and the base plate. In the following layers, they are glued to
each other and onto the foils. This provides a stable cell structure and a
solid connection between the cells and the supporting part of the module.
The end-pieces provide openings for the gas ﬂow through the cells and for
the connection of the anode wires with the high voltage boards.

Wire Support Strips: The wires are kept in the centers of the hexagonal
drift cells by means of wire support strips. As shown in Fig. 9, two types
of strips are used, both made of 100 µm thick FR4 laminate. The broad
strips are used to exactly position the wires, to ﬁx them by soldering, and
to connect them to the external circuitry. These strips are glued onto the foil
at both module ends (see Fig. 4). For modules with segmented wires they
are also used at the inner sector borders (see Fig. 6). On both ends they have
precision holes for the ﬁxation and pads with 50 µm slits for the alignment
relative to an external reference wire. The gold-plated copper pads for the
anode wire positioning and ﬁxation have a complicated structure. There are
short parts for the wire positioning in 50 µm slits and long parts for soldering,
one for the anode wire and one for either the connection to the HV board or

for the corresponding thick wire in an insensitive module section (see Fig.
6). All four parts are connected electrically by thin bridges which prevent
heat transfer when the second wire is soldered.

In order to prevent electrostatical instabilities due to slight module de-
formations, the free wire length must not exceed 60 cm. In cases where the
distance between the broad strips is larger than that, an appropriate number
of narrow support strips is equidistantly inserted.

Glue: Epoxy is used to glue the foils to each other, to glue the wire support
strips and to glue the end-pieces to the foils. As the outgassing of the epoxy
is a potential source of chamber aging, Stycast 1266A, an epoxy with very
low outgassing is chosen [19].

To improve the electrical contact between the foil layers, dots of conduc-
tive silver-loaded epoxy are distributed every 30 cm along the cell structure.

Wires: The anode wires are gold-plated tungsten wires of 25 µm diameter.
The wire tension is 50±5 g, and the elasticity limit is 130 g.

Thick copper/beryllium wires of 75 µm diameter are used for the signal
propagation from sensitive inner module sectors to the high voltage board
and the signal read-out at the module end (see Fig. 6). The large wire
diameter prevents signiﬁcant gas ampliﬁcation at the nominal operating
voltages. Both wire types are connected by soldering them to the wire
support strip. The thick wires are strung with the same tension as the thin
ones to balance the forces on the strips.

15

Solder Tin: A halogen-free solder tin with a reduced solder-forming ﬂux
is used to avoid larger amounts of ﬂux residuals around the solder point
on the wire support strips. A mask positioned around the strip protects
the cathode foil during soldering. The temperature of the soldering iron is
required to be 280◦ C.

Carbon Fiber Rods: Carbon ﬁber rods of 2 mm diameter are used to
increase the stiﬀness of modules longer than about 2 m. Three rods are glued
to both external module sides.

Aluminum Cover Foils: A further improvement of the mechanical sta-
bility is reached by covering both module sides with aluminum foils of 10 µm
thickness.

3.4 Production Tools

In order to produce stiﬀ honeycomb drift tube modules with precisely deﬁned
dimensions from foils which by themselves have no stability at all, the foils
are handled using templates which force them to assume the nominal cell
shape during assembly. Since the module length varies from 75 cm to 446 cm,
a modular template system is designed. The complex parts at both ends
and in the center, where the strips for the wire positioning and ﬁxation are
mounted, are machined from aluminum plates. The simpler parts in between
are made of metal-reinforced epoxy using a casting technology. They have
high precision and form stability but at much lower cost. In the template
grooves there are holes through which under-pressure is applied which safely
draws the foils into shape.

Each module production workplace consists of an upper and a lower
template (Fig. 10). After placing the ﬁrst set of foils, the wiring as well as
wire tension and high voltage stability tests are performed on the open cells
in the lower template. The upper template carries the set of top foils to be
glued. The glue is distributed with a foam roller on the enhanced part of
the foil proﬁle in the upper template. A special mask made of a thin steel
foil guarantees that the glue covers only the horizontal foil area and not the
inner cell walls. Then the upper template is lifted by a crane, rotated and
positioned above the lower template. With the help of positioning devices
it is placed precisely onto the lower one thus closing a monolayer.

For each working place the template parts are assembled and aligned on
a stable frame. Since the upper template has to be lifted and rotated, a
movable crane is used for the long templates of the PC and TC modules.
The template tolerances for the cell geometry and for the distance from the
ﬁrst to the last cell are better than 80 µm. The alignment accuracy of the
template parts is about 50 µm.

16

Figure 10: Production workplace with the upper template positioned above
the lower one just before closing the next cell layer.

3.5 Module Production

The main assembling steps are demonstrated in Fig. 4 for the ﬁrst monolayer
of a module. The module production starts with positioning the lower foil
and the base plates in the lower production template. On both sides the end-
pieces are glued to the foil and to the base plate giving a stable connection
between both. In the ﬁrst cell monolayer, wire supporting strips are glued
starting 7 mm from the foil ends. The next steps are the wiring of the
monolayer, the test of the wire tension and of the high voltage stability.
If necessary, bad wires are replaced. Then, epoxy is distributed on the
foil in the upper template and the layer is closed. After the curing of the
glue, which lasts about three hours at room temperature, the procedure is
repeated for the next monolayer. Finally, the carbon ﬁber rods and the
aluminum cover foil are glued onto both module sides, and the high voltage
boards are mounted.

To achieve the required throughput, the production was organized in
diﬀerent laboratories (NIKHEF Amsterdam, IHEP Beijing, Tsinghua Univ.
Beijing, JINR Dubna, DESY in Hamburg and in Zeuthen). For the mass
production standardized production templates, tools and the same detec-

17

In addition, standardized
tor materials were distributed to all institutes.
production procedures and quality tests have enforced coherent production
conditions. In total 22 workplaces were installed in the clean rooms of the
collaborating institutions, 17 of them for the production of PC- and TC-
modules, and the others for the MC-modules.

With two shifts per day, a standard module with 4 monolayers can be
built and tested within three days. The limiting factor is the curing time
of the glue, but at each institute there were enough workplaces to avoid
idle time. The production of the 978 modules could be ﬁnished within 15
months.

3.6 Quality Tests

The nominal wire tension is 50 ± 5 g and wires outside of the tolerance limit
have to be replaced. Before the monolayer is closed by the upper foil, the
average dark current of all wires is measured in air using a high voltage of
2000 V. The allowed maximum current is 30 nA at low air humidity. Wires
with larger currents are cleaned and have to be replaced if the current is
still above the limit.

Each module production site operates a test stand for high voltage train-
ing and single wire test of the produced modules. The modules to be tested
are put into a gas-tight box which is then ﬂushed with an Ar/CO2 (50:50)
gas mixture. The high voltage is ramped up to the nominal values of 1850
(2230) V for the 5 (10) mm drift cells. Only in rare cases the dark currents
of single HV groups are so high that this has to be done in steps. Wires
which after 12 hours at nominal HV still show dark currents > 1 µA are
considered unusable and are disconnected.

After the training, the analog signals from all wires are checked. This
is done using either a cosmic particle trigger setup or a radioactive source
together with an oscilloscope and allows to identify dead and noisy wires.
Of the 112 674 wires in the Outer Tracker 482 are disconnected because of
shorts or excessive dark currents, 363 showed no signals, and 402 have noise
rates > 100 kHz. This corresponds to a fraction of 1.1 % bad wires.

The results of quality control during module production and testing are
recorded in a document ﬁle which accompanies each module from the start
of production till the installation in a chamber. A computer readable test
sheet per module can be inspected via a graphical web interface and is used
during data taking for data quality cross-checks.

4 Superlayer Structure and Assembly

Table 1 summarizes the positions, dimensions and stereo layer conﬁgura-
tions of all Outer Tracker superlayers. A schematical view of the structure
which is typical for PC and TC superlayers is given in Fig. 11. It shows

the division into two independent chambers across the proton and electron
beam pipes. In their nominal position both chambers overlap to avoid de-
tection ineﬃciencies for track reconstruction. The chambers are mounted on
rails which allows for a movement perpendicular to the beam axis for easier
installation and repair. Each chamber consists of two main components, the
gas box and the outer steel frame.

4.1 Gas Box with Detector Modules

The gas box of a chamber fulﬁlls several requirements:

• It allows for a precise mounting of the modules in all stereo layers.

• It provides a gas tight enclosure for the modules which is ﬁlled with

the counting gas.

detector.

• It places as little material as possible in the acceptance area of the

The box consists of a C-shaped aluminum frame, a thin carbon ﬁber cap
which closes the C and covers the modules in the overlap area, and two large
sandwich panels closing the front and the back of the box.

The picture of an open TC chamber in Fig. 12 shows the gas box frame
together with plates on which the modules are mounted. By means of snap
rings the plates are held in well-deﬁned positions on large dowel pins which
are anchored in the frame. This deﬁnes the z-positions of the stereo layers.
On the plates there are many holes for pins and screws which are needed for
vertical and horizontal module positioning and ﬁxation.

The metal frame of the gas box has cut-outs into which so-called feed-
through boards are inserted. These provide gas-tight connections of signal
and HV lines from the modules inside to the outside of the gas box. On
the outside, the ASD-8 boards are directly plugged onto the feed-through
boards.

The large plates which close the gas box have to withstand large forces
even at only 0.5 mbar overpressure inside the gas volume. On the other
hand, the plates have to consist of light-weight material to minimize their
contribution to the total material budget in the detector acceptance area.
The plates are sandwich panels with an aramid paper core of hexagonal cell

20

structure covered by two plates of carbon or glas ﬁber epoxy composite for
the PC or TC chambers, respectively [30]. The cover plates with dimensions
of about 2.5 × 3.2 m2 for PC and 3.5 × 5 m2 for TC chambers are glued on
the gas box frame and additionally ﬁxed by screws. The inner side of the
plates is covered by a thin aluminum foil which provides an electrical shield-
ing and prevents the contamination of the drift gas by outgassing products
of the plate epoxy.

In the overlap area of both chambers end-caps made of a 1 mm thick car-
bon ﬁber epoxy composite material close the gas boxes. The right picture
in Fig. 12 shows the cap of the PC2 chamber. Its structure is rather compli-
cated since the cap has to enclose modules of six diﬀerent stereo layers, to
assure appropriate overlap and to follow the cut-out for the beam pipe. The
caps were produced using templates which could be adjusted to the lengths
and layer conﬁgurations of all chambers [31].

4.2 Outer Steel Frame

The outer steel frame is designed such that it can carry the weight of the gas
box and the cables. The weight of a complete TC chamber is about three
tons. The C-shaped steel frame is open towards the other chamber. Within
the frame, the gas box containing the detector modules is mounted. The
rectangular proﬁle of the frame houses the large amount of signal cables,
which are twisted pair cables connecting the ASD-8 front-end boards on top
and bottom of the gas box with the TDC boards installed in crates at the
vertical outer side of the frame. The holes in the steel proﬁle seen in the left
picture of Fig. 12 facilitate the insertion of cable bundles.

4.3 Assembly and Installation Steps

The chamber assembly starts with routing of prepared signal cable bundles
in the outer frame from the position of the feedthrough boards to the corre-
sponding TDC crates. Next, the gas box, still without front cover plate and
overlap caps, is installed in the cabled frame. For module installation the
chamber is brought to an upright position in a large dust-protection tent,
in order to avoid extreme bending of the modules during installation.

The modules are installed layer by layer. After bringing all module ﬁxa-
tion plates of a layer into their nominal positions, the modules are positioned
and screwed on the top plates. On the bottom plates only the lateral posi-
tion is ﬁxed by a dowel pin in a precise slit in the module base plate, thus
allowing for thermal expansion of the modules without buckling. Then, the
signal cables are plugged and the high voltage cables are plugged soldered to
the corresponding connectors on the inner sides of the feedthrough boards.
Only after a careful check of all electrical connections and of the high voltage
stability of the just installed modules the chamber assembly proceeds to the

21

next stereo layer.

After all modules are installed, the front cover plate is glued and screwed
to the gas box frame. The gas box is closed by mounting the cap structure in
the overlap region with the other chamber. After checking the gas tightness
of the assembled chamber it is equipped with ASD-8 ampliﬁer boards on
the feedthrough boards and with TDC boards in the crates on the outer
frame. The low and high voltage distributions are installed as well. Hence
all electronics can be commissioned using test pulses before the chamber is
installed in the experiment.

Special support structures are used for transporting the chambers from
the assembly to the experimental hall. In the HERA-B detector there is a rail
for each superlayer from which both chambers are suspended. This allows
chamber movement to and from the beam pipe which facilitates installation
and maintenance of the Outer Tracker. Even for the largest chambers, the
installation with the connection of the external cables and gas pipes takes
no longer than a day.

4.4 Description of the Detector Geometry

In order to achieve a maximum of detector hermeticity with a minimum
amount of material, the OTR detector geometry became rather compli-
cated. The design of the superlayers and of the diﬀerent module types was
performed using a CAD system. The information on module and superlayer
types as well as their geometrical description is stored in a data base. For
the Monte Carlo simulation with GEANT [32], in addition to the geometri-
cal data, all material properties of gas boxes and detector modules are taken
into account. In total about 2500 diﬀerent detector volumes are described,
which are the module sectors (see Fig. 3).

In Fig. 13 the material distribution is shown in terms of radiation lengths
for the PC1 and TC1 superlayers. On average PC1 has 4–5 % of a radiation
length, TC1 only 3–4 %.

Most of the material is concentrated in the overlap region of both cham-
bers of each superlayer. In the area of TC1 for the 5 mm modules the wire
support strips are visible. These areas are rather broad due to staggering of
the strips within a module and the inclination of the stereo layers. Summing
up the material contributions of all 13 superlayers, one gets about 0.4 ra-
diation lengths on average and about 0.7 radiation lengths in some overlap
areas of the chambers.

With the changed physics programme of HERA-B for the 2002 run the
reconstruction eﬃciency for K 0
It was
found to be more crucial to reduce the background in the ECAL from sec-
ondary interactions in the magnet. As a consequence, the superlayers MC2–
MC8 were removed from the detector which reduced the average material
contribution of the Outer Tracker to 0.3 radiation lengths.

S decays was of minor importance.

lengths.

5 Gas System

The drift velocity of the counting gas has to be large because of the 96 ns
time distance between bunches and the requirement to register events within
this time. With a gas mixture containing a suﬃcient fraction of the fast
gas component CF4, drift velocities of up to 150 µm/ns are reached [33].
After studies of aging and etching properties with diﬀerent gas mixtures
like CF4/CH4, Ar/CF4/CH4 and Ar/CF4/CO2 [17], the latter mixture was
chosen with a volume ratio of 65 %/30 %/5 %.

The total volume of all OTR chambers is about 22 m3. Because of the
high cost of CF4 and also for environmental reasons, it is necessary to use a
closed-loop gas system. The block diagram in Fig. 14 shows the functionality.
The circuit consists of the following components: A 1.5 m3 storage tank
where fresh gas coming from the mixing station is added to the circulation,
the puriﬁcation system, the distribution station which regulates the gas ﬂow
into the 26 chambers, and the pump station with 15 metal bellow pumps
which circulate the gas. Both, gas ﬂow and pressure are regulated and
controlled with help of a programmable logic controller for the pressure
transducers and mass ﬂow controllers. The ﬂow rate through the system
is 20 m3/h, i.e. almost one volume exchange per hour. The gas enters a
chamber through a distribution pipe at the bottom, ﬂows through the cells
of the modules, and leaves the gas box at the top. In order to minimize air
intake through leaks in the gas boxes, the pressure in all chambers is kept
at 0.5 mbar above atmospheric pressure. A safety tank ﬁlled with counting
gas is acting as a buﬀer volume to minimize air intake in an alarm situation
when the regulation is switched oﬀ and the chambers open to the outside
via safety valves and safety tank. A detailed description of the gas system
and its performance is given in [34].

23

Figure 14: Schematical view of the OTR gas system.

Gas Storage and Mixing: There are two 450-liter gas storage reservoirs
ﬁlled with liquid Argon and with CO2, respectively, and a 600-liter tank for
CF4. The gases ﬂow into the mixing station in ratios controlled by gas ﬂow
regulators and then into the storage tank. In case of the ﬁrst ﬁll or for a
longer shut-down period, a cheaper Ar/CO2 mixture is used to remove the
air or to prevent that air enters the closed-loop system. With addition of the
CF4 component one obtains the proper working gas mixture within several
days. During data taking about 0.5 to 2 % fresh gas per volume exchange is
continuously added to the circulating gas. This results in a CF4 consumption
of about 400 kg/month. The required tolerances for the gas composition are
65±1%, 30±1% and 5±0.2% for Argon, CF4 and CO2, respectively.

Puriﬁcation Station: Before the gas is distributed to the diﬀerent cham-
bers, it is puriﬁed by removing oxygen and water. There are two regenerable
puriﬁer stations installed, both containing 60 kg of catalyst R3-11G [35].
While one of them is in operation, the other station is excluded from the
closed-loop circuit for regeneration. About every 10 days the stations are
switched. This guarantees a continuous gas puriﬁcation keeping the oxygen
content below 200 ppm and the water level below 20 ppm. Mainly due to
residual air in the system and because of small leaks, there is a non-negligible
fraction of nitrogen in the counting gas. The nitrogen level is kept below
2000 ppm by continuously venting a small fraction of the circulating gas and
by adding a corresponding amount of fresh gas.

24

Trace contaminants in the counting gas were suppressed by strictly avoid-
ing the use of outgassing materials in ﬁttings, seals, pumps etc. Stainless
steel and ﬂexible metal tube piping was used throughout the system.

Gas Analysis for Quality Control: The system continuously analyses
the gas by measuring the fractions of the three main components and of
certain impurities like oxygen, nitrogen and water. The common input after
puriﬁcation and all output lines from the 26 chambers can be connected via
a programmable switch to the gas analysis station which consists of a gas
chromatograph, an oxygen meter and a moisture meter. Each measurement
takes about 10 minutes, i.e. after 4.5 hours a given line is measured again.

6 Summary

The Outer Tracker of the HERA-B experiment provides 90 % solid angle
coverage in the center-of-mass system and is capable of recording up to 200
charged particle tracks every 96 ns.

In total 13 superlayers, each consisting of two individual planar drift
chambers, were assembled and installed in three areas of the experiment: 7
inside the magnet, 4 between magnet and RICH, and 2 in front of the electro-
magnetic calorimeter. The stereo layers inside each chamber are composed
of honeycomb drift tube modules. Module assembly from folded Pokalon-C
foils results in a close-packed hexagonal drift cell structure. The technique
of installing anode wires into open drift cells facilitates also longitudinal
wire segmentation which is needed for limiting the occupancy close to the
proton beam. Chamber aging, observed with prototype modules at high
hadron ﬂuxes, was cured by coating the cathode foils with thin layers of
copper and gold, and by a proper drift gas. In total 978 detector modules
with about 113000 electronics channels have been built. Two thirds of the
modules have 5 mm diameter drift cells, the cell size in the others is 10 mm.
Over a period of 15 months module production proceeded in parallel at six
diﬀerent laboratories, using the same tools, materials, and instructions. The
initial fraction of bad channels was 1.1 %.

The honeycomb drift tube modules oﬀer clear advantages in terms of
operational safety, cathode aging, and easy mechanical handling. Although
made of light material, the total amount of scattering material was on aver-
age about 0.4 radiation lengths in the ﬁducial volume of the detector. For
the 2002 run this was reduced to 0.3 radiation lengths by removing chambers
from the magnet.

For the 26 chambers of the Outer Tracker, with a total volume of 22 m3,
a closed-loop gas system was built. It allows to regulate the ﬂow, to control
the pressure of the Ar/CF4/CO2 (65:30:5) gas mixture in all chambers, and
to purify the gas.

25

During its operation from December 2001 until March 2003, the Outer
Tracker of HERA-B worked well, as will be described in more detail in a
forthcoming paper on OTR performance [12].

In conclusion, it has been shown that a large tracker can be eﬃciently

built and safely operated under high radiation load at a hadron collider.

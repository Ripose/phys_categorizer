Introduction

The alignment of the DØ tracking detectors is crucial for many physics analyses. The precision
determination of the detector element positions improves the track reconstruction and the pre-
cision measurements at the interaction point. This is particularly important for Higgs, top and
B-physics, and for an impact parameter trigger. A general overview of the DØ detector [1] and
operation [2] has recently been given. Figure 1 shows the central DØ detector, Fig. 2 gives the
positions of the barrel wafers and F-disk wedges, and Fig. 3 displays a side-view of the SMT
with barrels, F-disks and H-disks.

Fig. 1: Central DØ detector. The Silicon Microstrip Tracker (SMT) and the Central Fiber Tracker (CFT) are used
for the central tracking.

2. Method and alignment procedure

The basic method to align the wafers is to minimize axial-residuals and z-residuals (Fig. 4). In
the SMT, there are 432 barrel wafers, 144 F-disk wedges, and 96 H-disk wedges. The CFT
encompasses 304 ribbons (each with 256 parallel scintillating ﬁbers, 1.6 or 2.5 m long). In
total 976 elements require alignment. The initial position of the sensitive barrel elements were
determined from metrology measurements.

1

The alignment procedure is as follows: a track is ﬁtted with all hits, except the hit from
the sensitive element to be aligned. Then, axial-residuals and z-residuals of the hit on the wafer
to be aligned, are determined. The pull (residual/error) is calculated and the corresponding
χ2 as a sum of pulls from all tracks on the wafer are determined. The χ2 is minimized as a
function of the wafer position (three space coordinates and three angles). All wafer positions are
determined and these positions serve as input geometry for the next iterative step. The iterative
process continues until a convergence criterion is reached. A wafer is considered aligned if
the shift divided by its uncertainty of a sensitive element between two iterations is less than a
certain value. This value is called the ‘shift limit’.

For the barrel, Fig. 5 shows a histogram of the number of hits per wafer for 50,000 events,
and shows the shifts of each wafer between two consecutive iterations for the ﬁrst and last
iteration, illustrating the convergence. The corresponding plots for the F-disk and CFT are
shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The number of tracks per event and the χ2 per degree of freedom for
the track reconstruction show an improvement after alignment (Fig. 8). A shift limit of 0.07 is
applied.

4. Optimization of convergence

In order to improve the alignment process, the convergence speed, the accuracy and the depen-
dence on the number of input events have been studied. Figure 13 shows the number of wafers
to be aligned as a function of the iteration number for a shift limit of 0.05. For this shift limit
value no convergence is obtained. The required numbers of iterations for convergence with
larger shift limits is also shown.

The variation between two aligned geometries for the same data and two different shift
limits has been studied. The differences in x and y-directions between two barrel geometries for
one geometry produced for shift limit 0.07, and the second one for 0.08 are shown in Figs. 14
and 15. The differences in x-direction between geometries produced with different shift limits
are also shown in Fig. 14 as a function of the shift limit. For small shift limits the variation is

below 3µm. While a very good precision of the relative wafer positions is obtained, a larger
shift of the entire SMT position is possible even for a small variation of the shift limit parameter.
The example in Fig. 15 shows a relative shift in y-direction of the SMT wafers with σ = 2.3µm,
a very similar value as in the x-direction. However, the entire SMT is shifted between the two
geometries by about 9µm. This corresponds to an oscillating behaviour of the axial shift as a
function of the wafer id.

Right: corresponding axial shift. There are 6 wafers per inner layers, and 12 per outer layers beyond wafer id 144.

In addition, the dependence of the wafer positions on the number of input events has been
studied (Fig. 16). Variations of the wafer positions in the aligned geometries below 5µm are
expected for more than 30,000 data input events. In a ﬁrst step the shift limit has been reduced
from 0.07 to 0.05, and in a further step it has been reduced from 0.05 to 0.04. Convergence
was achieved by using the aligned 0.05 geometry as starting geometry for the 0.04 run. The
convergence is illustrated in Fig. 17.

5. Uncertainties from procedure variations

In order to determine the uncertainty in the alignment procedure the CFT geometries are com-
pared for two cases a) when SMT and CFT were aligned simultaneously, and b) when the SMT
was aligned ﬁrst, and then the CFT was aligned. No signiﬁcant effect on the alignment was
observed (Fig. 18).

6. Single wafer re-alignment precision

Furthermore, in order to test the re-alignability and the corresponding systematic uncertainty,
one wafer was misaligned by 50µm w.r.t. the original aligned geometry, and subsequently re-
aligned. Remarkably, in the ﬁrst iteration of the re-alignment 432 elements were shifted. After
re-alignment all elements were within 1µm of the original position. The geometries before and
after re-alignment are compared to the original geometry (Fig. 19).

9. Alignability of wafers from different runs

As some wafers are non-operational depending on the time period of data-taking, the combi-
nation of data from different time periods improves the overall alignment. Table 1 summarizes
the numbers of aligned wafers for different data-taking periods.

10. Time stability of detector alignment

The detector alignment has been performed for different time periods. In order to determine
the alignment precision two aligned geometries from different time periods are compared. An
example is given in Fig. 22 for period 1 and 5. The time stability of the detector for various time
periods between April 2002 and December 2004 has been studied and no signiﬁcant variation
is observed (Fig. 23).

11. Local alignment: metrology

In addition to the previously described global alignment, where wafers are considered ideal
planes with no structure, the local alignment has been investigated. Local alignment refers to the
alignment on a given sensitive element. As an example, the wafer geometry and the separation
in z-direction is shown in Fig. 25. Figure 24 illustrates the positions of the ﬁducial points on
the wafers. This is particulary interesting as some wafers are made of two independent silicon
plates. The precision in the distance ∆z of two ﬁducial points for detector elements made of the
two sensors is given in Fig. 26 from metrology. No indication of a shift in the survey between
these plates is observed and variations are within ±10µm.

signiﬁcant variation from their design position (of about 390 µm) is observed.

Inﬂuence on physics results

In order to determine the resolution of the Distance of Closest Approach, DCA, the position of
the beamspot has been determined. A displaced beamspot position in the r-φ plane corresponds
to a sine dependance of the DCA δ as a function of the track direction φtrack. It is parametrized
like δ = δ0−P1 sin φtrack+P2 cos φtrack and this function is ﬁtted to the data as shown in Fig. 27.
The ﬁgure shows also the DCA resolution. The DCA resolution depends on the transverse
momentum of the track and Table 2 gives the DCA resolutions for different Pt ranges. The DCA
resolution consists of the beam-spot size convoluted with the Impact Parameter (IP) resolution.
The beam-spot size is approximately 30-40µm and depends on the machine optics.

The impact parameter resolution is crucial for the Silicon Track Trigger (STT). The
beamspot determination of the previous run is used. The resulting impact parameter resolu-
tion is shown in Fig. 28.

The impact parameter measurement is also an important aspect for b-quark tagging. Its
resolution after alignment in the ofﬂine analysis together with the Monte Carlo prediction is
shown in Fig. 29. Multiple scattering is the dominant source of resolution degradation at small

16

Pt values. The ﬁgure shows also the b-quark tagging efﬁciency versus the light quark mistag
rate.

The alignment uncertainty contributes to the systematic errors in several physics analyses.
The effect of the alignment uncertainty has been studied, for example, by assuming a constant
shift of 10µm in radial direction outward (Fig. 30) in order to estimate the impact on B-meson
lifetime measurements. Only a small contribution to the systematic uncertainty from alignment
in B-meson lifetime measurements is observed (Table 3).

13. Conclusions and outlook

About 850 sensitive elements have been aligned. The alignment precision is close to design
value (e.g. residuals: data 20µm, simulation 16µm). Some alignment parameters have been
optimized. Systematic uncertainties of the alignment procedure are less than about 10µm. The
monitoring of the detector stability showed no signiﬁcant movement. The alignment ensures
excellent on-line and off-line b-tagging, and lifetime measurements, and is therefore crucial
for Higgs, top, and B-physics. In spring 2006, a new inner layer [3], Layer-0, at 1.6 cm from
the interaction point will be installed inside the current vertex detector, which will signiﬁcantly
improve the impact parameter resolution, as illustrated in Fig. 33.

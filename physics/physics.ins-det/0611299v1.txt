1 Introduction

With the decision on the accelerator technology to be used for a future International
Linear Collider (ILC), detector R&D can become more focused. The time-line for an
R&D programme is also clearer with, assuming a technical design report to be written
by 2009, three years to deﬁne the make-up of a given sub-detector. Within the CALICE
collaboration, which is designing a calorimeter for the ILC, a collection of UK groups
(CALICE-UK) are part of the initial eﬀort to prototype a calorimeter composed of
silicon and tungsten [1]. The electromagnetic section of the calorimeter (ECAL) has
been taking test-beam data at DESY and CERN in 2006. The UK has designed and
built electronics to readout the ECAL [4] - these are also now being used by the analogue
hadronic calorimeter - and is taking part in the current data-taking period. Building on
this expertise, CALICE-UK has deﬁned an R&D programme. A signiﬁcant part of this
programme is the design of the data acquisition (DAQ) system for a future calorimeter.

In the work, DAQ equipment will be developed which attacks likely bottlenecks in the
future system and is also suﬃciently generic to provide the readout for new prototype
calorimeters, such as the prototype to be built in the EUDET project [5]. The main
aim is to start an R&D programme which will work towards designing the actual DAQ
system of the future calorimeter. Alternative designs of a DAQ system which could
aﬀect the layout of the ﬁnal detector or functionality of components are also considered.
The concept of moving towards a “backplaneless” readout is pursued. A strong under-
pinning thread here is to attempt to make use of commercial components and identify
any problems with this approach. Therefore the system should be easily upgradable,
both in terms of ease of acquiring new components and competitive prices.

This note is organised as follows. The parameters of the superconducting accelerator
design and calorimeter structure and properties which impinge upon considerations of
the DAQ system for a calorimeter are discussed in Section 2. The main body of the
note in Section 3 discusses the DAQ design and proposes areas of R&D within it. The
work is will investigate the three principal stages of the DAQ system: the connection
along the calorimeter module; the connection from the on- to oﬀ-detector; and the oﬀ-
detector receiver. In Section 4 a model DAQ system for the ﬁnal ECAL is proposed.
This necessarily makes many assumptions but gives an idea of the scale of the system
involved:
it can also be the start of an initial costing. The note ends with a brief
summary in Section 5.

The programme detailed below will allow CALICE-UK groups to continue to assist in
development of new technologies for the DAQ system. We would expect to write a
chapter in the future technical design report on the DAQ system for the calorimeter.
For the ﬁnal calorimeter, the DAQ should ideally be the same for the ECAL and HCAL.
Although CALICE-UK has so far concentrated on the ECAL, our proposals for R&D
contained in this document are suﬃciently generic that both calorimeter sections should
be able to converge to use the DAQ system we design. This will place us in a position to
build the DAQ system for future large-scale prototype calorimeters (e.g. EUDET) and
the ﬁnal system. Indeed the principle of a generic design using commercial components
should be applicable to many detector sub-systems. Therefore, the R&D to be performed

1

here may have consequences or applications to the global DAQ system for a future
detector.

2 General detector and accelerator parameters

The design [1] for a calorimeter for the ILC poses challenges to the DAQ system mainly
due to the large number of channels to be read out. The TESLA design [1] for a sampling
electromagnetic calorimeter is composed of 40 layers of silicon interleaved with tungsten.
The calorimeter, shown in Fig. 1, has eight-fold symmetry and dimensions: a radius of
about 2 m, a length of about 5 m and a thickness of about 20 cm. Mechanically, the
calorimeter will consist of 6000 slabs, of length 1.5 m, each containing about 4000 silicon
p-n diode pads of 1×1 cm2, giving a total of 24 million pads. More recent designs for
the detector collaborations consider fewer layers, 29 for LDC [2] and 30 for SiD [3], and
also smaller pad sizes of 5×5 mm2, or even 3×3 mm2.

Figure 1: View of the barrel calorimeter modules and detail of the overlap region between
two modules, with space for the front-end electronics.

A generic scenario for the DAQ system is as follows. At the very front end (VFE),
ASIC chips will be mounted on the PCBs and will process a given number of pads. The
ASICs will perform pre-ampliﬁcation and shaping and should also digitise the data and
may even apply a threshold suppression. The current design [6] of such chips has each
containing 64 channels, although this may be higher in the ﬁnal calorimeter. The ASIC
power consumption has to be minimised as they are diﬃcult to cool due to the small
gaps between layers which are required to take advantage of tungsten’s Moli`ere radius.
The data will be digitised in the ASIC and transferred to the front-end (FE) electronics
which are placed in the detector at the end of the slab as shown in Fig. 1. It is expected
that zero suppression will be done in the FE (using FPGAs) to signiﬁcantly reduce the

2

rate. The data will then be transferred oﬀ the detector, probably via a network switch,
to a receiver of many PCI cards in a PC farm.

If we assume the TESLA design for data taking at 800 GeV, the following parameters
have to be considered. There will be a 4886 bunch crossings every 176 ns in a bunch
train, giving a bunch train length of about 860 µs. The bunch train period is 250 ms,
giving a duty factor between trains of about 0.35%. The ECAL is expected to digitise
the signal every bunch crossing and readout completely before the next bunch train. In
a shower, up to 100 particles/mm2 can be expected, which in a 1×1 cm2 pad equates to
10000 minimum ionising particle deposits. The ADC therefore needs a dynamic range
of 14 bits. Assuming no threshold suppression and that 2 bytes are used per pad per
sample, then the raw data per bunch train is 24 · 106 × 4886 × 2 = 250 GBytes which
equates to 0.3-2.5 MBytes for each ASIC depending on whether they process between
32 and 256 channels. The data appears within a bunch train length of 860 µs giving a
rate out of the ASIC of 0.4-3 GBytes/s, which we take to be 1 GBytes/s from now on.
Threshold suppression and/or buﬀering (to allow readout between bunch trains) within
the ASIC could reduce this rate. However, suppression in the ASIC may not be ﬂexible
enough compared with doing this in the FE and buﬀering requires some ASIC power
to remain on between bunch trains, potentially generating too much heat. Hence the
rates after the VFE depend on the assumptions made and system layout and will be
discussed for each individual case where necessary.

3 Design of a DAQ system

3.1 Transmitting digitised data from the VFE chip

The transmission of digitised data from the ASIC is very heavily inﬂuenced by what can
be done within the slab given the low heat-load requirements due to the diﬃculties of
cooling. It is not yet known what the capabilities of the VFE ASIC will be, so various
possibilities were considered.

In general, somewhere in the readout system, there will have to be an ADC and a
threshold discriminator. These tasks could in principle be performed in either order and
could be done in the VFE or in the FE. There is also the possibility of buﬀering events
in either the VFE or FE. This would allow the data to be read out between bunch trains
rather than bunch crossings. This entails a dramatic decrease in the rate of read out due
to the large spacing between bunch trains. There is then a matrix of possibilities, with
some number of the functionalities, ADC, thresholding and buﬀering, being done in the
VFE or FE. Below the four possibilities are considered for the ADC and thresholding,
and also the buﬀering in the VFE.

1. Neither ADC nor thresholding is done in the VFE

2. Only the ADC is done in the VFE

3. Only the thresholding is done in the VFE

3

4. Both are done in the VFE

5. Buﬀering done in the VFE

We consider that threshold discrimination is best done after the ADC step rather than
before. This allows much easier monitoring the pedestals and noise, etc., by allowing
some readout at a low rate even when below the threshold. In addition, setting a stable
analogue threshold is not easy; any drifts will change the level. The uniformity over all
channels might not be good enough which would then require a large number of trim
DACs.

1) If neither an ADC or threshold discriminator is built into the VFE ASIC (due to
them taking too much power), then the raw analogue signals will be sent out to the FE.
This is 2k analogue channels which require around 14 bits precision, which is not trivial
to achieve. Even if this can be done, digitising the data at the FE would be hard. The
space is limited and so it is likely only a restricted number of ADCs could be mounted
in this area. Assuming 20 channels of ADCs would be possible, then each would have
to handle 100 pads, with these being multiplexed in turn into the ADC. To keep up
with the sampling rate needed, i.e. 176 ns for each channel would therefore require the
ADCs to sample at 1.76 ns. Finding a 14-bit FADC which can do this would not be
easy. The alternative would be to use an analogue pipeline; assuming one for each of
the 20 ADC channels would result in each pipeline storing about 500k analogue samples
which is diﬃcult. Putting an analogue threshold in front of the ADCs would clearly
cut the rate down but would need a major ASIC development to handle this; a variable
length analogue pipeline with time-stamps would be needed. This is in addition to the
pedestal monitoring problems mentioned above.

2) Only doing the ADC on the VFE seems a much more reasonable option. The 14-bit
requirement is much easier to achieve with a short signal path before the ADC. The
digitised data can be transmitted from the VFE to the FE more easily than analogue
data. The rates are not trivial however; these would be around 50 GByte/s per slab, or
1 GByte/s from each wafer/ASIC. This is at the level where a ﬁbre would be needed;
commercial ﬁbres now carry 5 GBytes/s. Fibres are also less noisy than copper. This
use of ﬁbres within the slab would raise many other issues such as the power needed
to transmit the light out (or could it be supplied by an external laser and then only
modulated on the ASIC), how to reliably attach the ﬁbres at each end (a total of
300 000 ﬁbres would be needed for 6000 slabs each with 50 ASICs), how large the ﬁbre
connectors would be (the total thickness within the slabs is limited to some mm only),
etc.. Although this is an active area of commercial development, it is not clear if opto-
electronic intra-PCB communications will become standard enough on the time-scale
needed [7].

It is clear some development would be needed for this to be an option; the equivalent
system in ATLAS has three ﬁbres transmitting a total of 10 MBytes/s with a 2 mm high
connector needed. Self-aligning silicon-ﬁbre interfaces are possibilities; while we could
not do signiﬁcant R&D compared with the commercial sector, we could test industrial
prototypes and do R&D in conjunction with industry.

Once the data are on a ﬁbre direct from the ASIC, the idea of whether any FE electronics

4

would be needed at all was raised, as the ﬁbre would go 10s of metres, bypassing the FE
completely. However, shipping out all the raw data to the oﬄine seems an expensive
overkill, but is considered as this may change with commercial development.

3) Only doing the threshold in the VFE suﬀers from the same problems as mentioned
above; there is a diﬃculty of monitoring the pedestals as well as the complexity of the
ASIC needed to handle the channels.

4) Doing both ADC and threshold in the VFE places the easiest requirements on the
FE, with a corresponding increase in diﬃculty for the VFE. Assuming the threshold is
applied after the ADC, some communication of the threshold and other conﬁguration
data from the FE to the VFE will still be needed. The data rate out is clearly reduced;
it would be around 400 MBytes/s for the slab, or 20 MBytes/s for each wafer/ASIC.
Although easiest for transferring data from the VFE to FE, due to the low rates, it is not
clear if the threshold can be reliably applied in the VFE. This scenario also looks like
the situation if the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) technology - essentially
a digital calorimeter - were used rather than silicon diodes. For the diode option in
this scenario, it is also questionable as to whether signiﬁcant FE electronics logic is
needed. As the ASIC performs both ADC and threshold suppression, the data could be
transferred directly oﬀ the detector.

5) It is generally assumed that buﬀering in the FE is possible, with large amounts of
memory available in modern FPGAs. However, the issue of buﬀering in the ASICs is
more technically challenging. The challenges for such a procedure are having a large
enough memory integrated into the ASICs and the keeping the power low whilst the
data is being read out between bunch trains. The advantages are clear: the rate of
transmission from the ASIC to the FPGA is reduced by about two orders of magnitude.
For the proposed electrical connections along the board this will ease the transmission
signiﬁcantly.

We, therefore, propose R&D for two scenarios where only the ADC is done in the
VFE and where the ADC and thresholding are done in the VFE, both coupled with
buﬀering in the VFE because they provide realistic solutions and have complementary
In favour of only performing the ADC, any threshold suppression can
applications.
be performed more accurately in the FPGA at the FE rather than in the VFE. When
thresholding is also done in the VFE along with the ADC, the data transfer rate from
the VFE and FE is signiﬁcantly smaller. A schematic of scenario 2) is shown in Fig. 2.

In both scenarios, we intend to set-up a mock data transfer system which requires
having a test board with FPGAs linked by ﬁbres. This will simulate a link between
the VFE ASICs and the FE FPGAs. Any developed system e.g. a new VFE chip
design or the MAPS set-up could also be tested in our prototype system. We will also
demonstrate that the system would work for the hadronic calorimeter as well as the
ECAL. This would require modifying the system to have a more links but a lower rate.
The prototype will incorporate, wherever possible, commercially available components
such as Virtex-4 FPGAs [8] which has multi-gigabit serial transceivers and is compatible
with 10/100/1000 Mbit/s ethernet and PCI express x16 and higher.

The ﬁnal chip should have around 64 channels and would be embedded inside the de-

tector. The ADC(s) should be included in the chip in order to output digital data
serially at high rate (typically 1-2Gbit/s). The DAQ would thus look more like “an
event builder” than a traditional DAQ. It would perform the data reformatting (from
“ﬂoating” gain + 10bit to 16 bit), calibration, possibly linearisation and some digital
ﬁltering. It is possible that at this level, some event processing will be performed. The
other task of the DAQ is to load all the parameters needed by the front-end, control the
power cycling and run the calibration. These speciﬁcations ﬁt in well with our current
generic system.

The current version of the VFE ASIC chip [11] is being used to read out the existing
CALICE ECAL. This chip does not meet the requirements for the ILC ECAL and

1–2 years, it is expected to have a version of such a chip with low enough power and
noise that would serve as a realistic prototype. This ASIC is expected to have (at least)
32 channels, an internal ADC per channel, multiple gain ranges, and optional threshold
suppression and digital buﬀering to reduce the required output rate.

Instead of using silicon diodes, the feasibility of using the MAPS technology is to be
investigated [10]. The use of this technology would also have an impact on the design
of the DAQ system. Here, there would be no ADC and a threshold has to be applied
on the wafer, by deﬁnition. The data rate for a ﬁnal detector would be 3 GBytes/s per
slab, or 150 MBytes/s per wafer, which is low enough for non-ﬁbre communication.

If threshold suppression or buﬀering could be done in the VFE ASIC, the rate to the FE
would be reduced by two orders of magnitude. Current designs cannot do this and it may
not even be desirable or practical, so we have to allow for data rates of order GByte/s
needing to be transferred out of each VFE ASIC during the bunch train. Whether
an electrical or optical connection would be needed has to be investigated. Although
chip-to-chip ﬁbres are not yet standard technology, this is an active area of industrial
research [7].

Issues of how the data would be transported from the VFE to FE have to be considered
and can be done already without a real prototype. Transporting of order GByte/s of
data over 1.5 m in a very limited space is a challenge. The conventional approach would
be to use copper but here the eﬀects of noise and interference will have to be considered.

6

There is also the possibility of using optical ﬁbres although here there are also design
considerations: the size of connectors would have to be investigated as the vertical
clearance at the VFE is of the order of mm and the power needed to transmit light out
would also need to be investigated. This work ties in closely with the mechanical and
thermal aspects of the design.

In preparation for a real prototype, a test system will be built with a 1.5 metre PCB
containing FPGAs linked optically or electronically. The data transfer would then be
considered as a function of the number of VFEs, whether zero suppression is done in
the VFEs and whether data is buﬀered during the bunch train. The bandwidth and
cross-talk of the data transfer can be simulated using CAD tools. The clock and control
distribution from the front-end to the VFE chips can be investigated as to whether one
transmission line per chip is needed or multi-drop is possible.

Figure 3: A comparison of the two scenarios, “Alternative conﬁguration” (left) and
“Standard conﬁguration” (right) for the on- to oﬀ-detector DAQ system.

7

Standard Conﬁguration
In our assumed standard detector conﬁguration, communication from the VFE will
pass via the electronics at the FE to an oﬀ-detector receiver. We assume that threshold
suppression will be done at the FE, and hence the rate would be signiﬁcantly reduced
from that at the VFE. Assuming that the rate is reduced to 1% of the original data
volume of 250 GBytes per bunch train and each sample above threshold needs a channel
and timing label, the total data volume to be read out from the calorimeter is about
5 GBytes or about 1 MByte per slab. These data have to be read out within a bunch
train period of 250 ms, giving a rate of 5 MBytes/s.

Alternative conﬁguration
Here we imagine that the FE is removed and the communication is directly from the VFE
to the oﬀ-detector. We assume that the ASIC only digitises the data and 250 GBytes has
to be transported oﬀ the detector per bunch train. This will require a high-speed optical
network. It should be noted, however, that the need for FE electronics also becomes
questionable if more processing is done on the ASIC chip, such as threshold suppression.
In such a scenario, transporting the data directly from the ASIC oﬀ the detector could
be done and so the FE would become redundant. The number of ﬁbres required to
read-out the 24 million channels would vary between 750 000 to about 90 000 depending
on whether the ASIC handles 32 or 256 channels. If we assume that the diameter of
a ﬁbre is 150 µm, or with cladding 250 µm then if half of the circumference of 12 m
had ﬁbres running along it, the bundle would be up to 1 cm in depth, but could be as
little as 1 mm, depending on the number of ASICs and hence ﬁbres. This would leave
ample room for other cables and power supplies. This concept would revolutionise the
whole calorimeter design and so needs to be considered now when changes in its general
structure could be considered. Our research in this area will provide important feedback
to groups designing the ASIC chips.

The oﬀ-detector receiver, as described later, is assumed to consist of PCI cards housed
in PCs. The reliability of large PC farms is an issue for reading out the data; if one
PC goes down, all of the data in that region of the calorimeter is lost. Current PC
farms show a rate of 1 PC failure per day in a farm of 200. This is not large but is
also not small and would require some surplus of PCs (say 10%) above the number
required based just on the number of detector channels. For a ﬁnal working calorimeter
readout system these PCs would need to be repaired and put back into the system
on a regular basis. The standard scenario would require less high-speed equipment oﬀ
the detector, whereas the alternative would require many optical ﬁbres with dedicated
optical switching. The alternative scenario would, however, remove material from inside
the detector which would ease construction and have a potentially advantageous impact
on event reconstruction and, hence, physics measurements.
It would also reduce the
number of processing components within the detector which could be attractive since
they would be inaccessible for long periods of time.

Using the experience gained from the two scenarios above, a hybrid path can be ex-
plored. By optimising the functionality in the VFE and matching it to an FE, overall
instantaneous data rates can be reduced as well as lowering ﬁbre count. For example,
if data is buﬀered in the VFE, some form of passive multiplexer can be envisaged that

8

will combine data from all the VFEs. This could take the form of spliced optic-ﬁbres,
or an OR gate. This would not necessarily remove the need for an FE, but the reduced
size and complexity will have many beneﬁts (thermal, conﬁguration time, SEUs, cost,
etc.).

To transmit data onto the detector, we will attempt to use the same commercial hard-
ware used for oﬀ-detector communication. The requirements are diﬀerent, though, as
the detector front-end requires clock and synchronisation signals as well as low-level
conﬁguration and data signals. Commercial network hardware is not ideally suited to
synchronous tasks but the signiﬁcant cost and reliability beneﬁts make it worthy of in-
vestigation. This is split into two areas: failsafe conﬁguration prior to normal running,
and clock and control signal distribution.

Failsafe Conﬁguration In a scenario requiring an FPGA on-detector, it is imperative
that the device can be re-conﬁgured remotely. This is necessary not only because of the
number of FPGAs but also because of the uncertainty in the detector performance in
terms of data suppression, pedestal drifts, bad channel identiﬁcation etc., all of which
have to be implemented in the FE FPGA. The optimal algorithms for these tasks will
only be determined after some experience of operating the calorimeter. As the FPGAs
are relatively inaccessible, it is important that a failsafe method of reseting and re-
conﬁguring the devices exists.

Avoiding the use of additional control lines necessitates a means to extract signals from
the communications interface. Most probably this will involve “spying” on the serial
data line.

Of primary importance is to force the FPGA into a known state under any conditions
(i.e. a hard-reset). It may simply be possible to send an exceptionally long series of “1”s
to the slab (say 40M = 1 second) where an RC type-circuit with a long time-constant
will trigger the reset. A more complex method would require some discrete logic (like
a shift-register with parallel output into a comparator) searching the incoming data-
stream for a “magic” number. Power cycling the board is also a (less elegant) solution,
but still requires attention in circuit design to ensure the FPGA will boot.

Once hard-reset, the FPGA will follow its start-up logic to initiate the boot - making
use of 2 distinct methods:

• Use a non-volatile base conﬁguration that is either hardwired into the FPGA or
provided by a EEPROM external to the FPGA. In this case the FPGA would
assist in writing the conﬁguration to its internal RAM and then issue a re-boot-
using-internal-conﬁguration command to itself.

• By waiting for external stimulus (usually a clock) to control data the data being
fed into the device. This requires additional hardware to format the the serial-data
into data/clock/control for FPGA consumption.

In both cases some external hardware is required, the amount of which will only fully
understood after a more detailed evaluation. A possible outcome could be that a small
non-volatile programmable device could provide the most ﬂexible solution, but the eﬀects
of radiation need further examination.

9

Larger devices with non-volatile conﬁguration memories could be used for the entire
front-end logic, but apart from the increased cost and limited re-programming cycles
making these less desirable, these devices are not able to re-program themselves.

Reliability in the detector environment of these memories over the lifetime of an ex-
periment, as well as SEUs, also need to be addressed. Non-volatile memories have
limited programming cycles, whereas modern SRAM-based FPGAs boast that they can
re-conﬁgured an inﬁnite number of times. By refreshing the conﬁguration periodically,
the eﬀect of SEU corruption can be minimised. Considering an FPGA with one million
logic gates (which speciﬁes a 4 Mbit PROM), conﬁguring this device at 40 MHz would
take 100 ms - a re-conﬁg every 250 ms bunch-train!

Being able to re-conﬁgure the FE when needed also allows the selection of a smaller
component that can be conﬁgured for speciﬁc function, rather than a large one-size ﬁts
all device.

Reducing the number of components on the front-end-module is advantageous from
a cost, reliability and dead material point of view, so we will focus on methods of
generating a data-stream onto the detector that requires the minimum of components
to extract signals from the physical network interface module.

Clock and Control To ensure the on-detector electronics captures data from actual
collisions, all components in the detector are synchronised to the bunch-crossing clock.
Bunch-train start, stop and ID signals are also be required. Traditionally this is done
with a bespoke, low-latency, highly synchronous system, but here we will look at using
a commercial network switch.

Switches are not designed for synchronous signal fanout.
In fact the now obsolete
forerunner to the switch, the hub, is much better suited to the task. Modes for signal
broadcasting do exist, but these need to be closely examined. Studies on latency and
port-to-port skew will be undertaken.

To obtain maximal control over timing, the lowest level protocols will need to be used.
Directly accessing the network at the physical layer (i.e. as a simple serial link) would
facilitate complete control over data-packet composition and timing. For this a specialist
and customisable network interface card is required.

To regenerate the clock at the detector end, the time structure of the data transmitted
needs to be structured accordingly. This would probably take the form of a local os-
cillator being periodically resynced to the data clock. As the bunch-crossing interval is
7 ns, a 1 Gbit (1 ns) link would be the minimum rate needed. Board-level signals, such
as train-start may also need to be decoded directly from the data stream (as with the
failsafe system above).

In summary, this is as an investigation to verify that a clock, control and conﬁguration
system can be constructed using commercial network hardware for distribution.

An ideal system would have all data from the detector for each bunch train sent directly
to a single PC where full event reconstruction would be performed. However, considering
that the electromagnetic calorimeter alone will contain 24 million channels, even after
data suppression this seems unfeasible.

It would, however, be desirable to geographically group as many channels as possible at
a processor. This would permit broader local clustering which could be used as an input
to full event reconstruction later. The fundamental questions to be answered are how
much of the calorimeter can be received into one PC and how much needs to be received
to make local clustering eﬀective. The impact this has on full event reconstruction and
on simulated physics needs to be evaluated. This task therefore involves a combination
of hardware and simulation work.

We propose a system comprising PCI cards (see Fig. 4) mounted in PCs. These cards
will provide timing, clock, control and conﬁguration data, be capable of performing
local clustering, as well as being able to be re-conﬁgured to act as data transmitters
to exercise the receivers. We will use the “new” PCI Express bus standard [9] as this
oﬀers increased bandwidth and ﬂexibility by using many high bandwidth serial links
(called lanes) instead of a single parallel bus. It is expected to be scalable due to future
increases in the number of lanes. Aside from providing an interface to the processor,
lanes can be setup between cards, allowing advanced clustering prior to processing.

Although it is hard to predict what technology will be available for the ﬁnal system,
gaining experience with serial bus technologies now, will prove valuable for estimates of
how much data can be realistically processed by a computer and help us understand the
beneﬁts and bottlenecks, as well as the scalability.

Much of this DAQ workpackage relies on novel methods in using network infrastructure,
so a card providing both direct access to the network hardware and room to build any
other functionality is useful. This applies to the PCI Express interface too, where the
card will be able to test-drive the bus and provide debug feedback and monitoring.

4 A model DAQ system for the ECAL

As has been discussed in this note many options exist for the functionality of the com-
ponents at various stages.
It is therefore diﬃcult to make a deﬁnitive statement on
what a DAQ system would like and how many components it would have. However,
work is ongoing to try and do as much of the work (data reduction) as possible on the
detector, thereby reading out as little as possible. Therefore we consider that the ADC
and thresholding are done in a 32-channel VFE and buﬀering in the FE. Under this
model and making reasonable assumptions on the data rate a model system is detailed
below.

The raw data size is assumed to be 2 Bytes per channel with an additional 4 Bytes per
channel needed for a timing label. Imposing the threshold suppression reduces the data
rate by a factor of 100, leading to a data size for the whole detector of (24 × 106 × 4886 ×

6)/100 = 7.0 GBytes. The size per slab is then 1.1 MBytes. As the data is buﬀered in
the FE, it is read out between bunch trains giving a rate per slab of 4.7 MBytes/s. Early
testing will readout some slabs individually, but as the system grows and stabilises, it
would clearly be advantageous to bundle the data from several slabs together. Bundling
half a tower of 20 slabs would give a rate of 0.75 Gbit/s which could be adequately
read out using current ﬁbres. Such a grouping would lead to 300 ﬁbres coming oﬀ the
detector. Assuming a PCI card which can receive 8 ﬁbres, this would require 38 PCI
cards. With a PC hosting 2 such cards than a system of 19 PCs would be required. We
then assume a 20% contingency for more ﬁbres reading out neighbouring areas to allow
for redundancy and for faulty PCs or PCI cards. This gives a total of about 50 PCI
cards housed in 25 PCs a clearly manageable number for such a granular calorimeter.

5 Summary

A conceptual design of a data acquisition system for the ILC calorimeter has been
discussed. The concept relies heavily on commercial equipment and is generic such that
it could be applied to other detector systems. Potential bottlenecks have been identiﬁed
and form a programme of research and development of the next three to four years for
the CALICE-UK groups. Bench tests and real-time tests with prototype calorimeters,
within the EUDET project, will be undertaken. After this period, a technical design of
the data acquisition system will be possible.

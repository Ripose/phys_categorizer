Abstract

We report on test results of a novel ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detection
system consisting of a 3 meter long gaseous C4F8O radiator, a focusing mirror, and
a photon detector array based on Hamamatsu multi-anode photomultiplier tubes.
This system was developed to identify charged particles in the momentum range
from 3-70 GeV/c for the BTeV experiment.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detection has proven to be a most useful way
to distinguish the identities of charged particles, both hadrons and leptons, in
high energy physics experiments [1]. We report on measurements of Cherenkov
ring images using a 3 meter long octaﬂuorotetrahydrofuran, C4F8O, gas ra-
diator and Hamamatsu multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMT), model
R8900-M16, to measure the Cherenkov angle. This gas has never been used
before in this application and the tubes are new versions that also have not
been tested. This system was designed for the now defunct BTeV experiment

planned for Fermilab. The main design criteria was the ability to separate
charged pions from kaons at the four standard deviation level for momenta
between 3 and 70 GeV/c. We intended to achieve this separation by detecting
about 40 photons, each with angular resolution of 0.75 mr. We show how we
derive these expectations below.

The tests were done using a 120 GeV/c proton beam at Fermilab. We con-
structed a full length version of the detector that had, however, a smaller
width and used a single spherical focusing mirror.

This system was originally designed using C4F10 as a radiator. The production
of this gas, however, has been ended. Thus although stockpiles of the gas exist,
the long term prospects for use in physics detectors are not good. We will show
that C4F8O provides an excellent alternative.

2 APPARATUS

2.1 Introduction

The basic components of the test system are shown in Fig. 1. The tank contains
the gas in both arms. The beam traverses 3 meters of gas in one arm in which it
generates Cherenkov light. The light is reﬂected by a spherical focusing mirror
onto an array of MAPMTs. These tubes are placed in their own enclosure,
separated from the gas volume by a 0.64 cm thick UVT acrylic window. The
MAPMT readout consists of specialized front end electronics developed in
conjunction with IDE-AS of Oslo, Norway. These devices are mounted on
hybrids connected a PCI based data acquisition system described below. We
now discuss properties of each of these items.

2.2 Mirror and Optics

The mirror was produced by the COMPAS Consortium (Czech Republic). It is
made of glass with an aluminized front face having an hexagonal shape 60 cm
across each diagonal point-to-point. The radius of curvature was measured to
be 659 cm by ﬁnding the focal position of the light from a small source reﬂected
oﬀ the entire mirror surface. The same technique allowed for measurement
of the spot size, deﬁned as the diameter of the circle that contains 95% of
the reﬂected light. For this mirror the spot size is 2.97 mm. This is small
enough that any dispersive eﬀects due to mirror quality will be negligible. The
reﬂectivity of the mirror was not measured directly by us but was speciﬁed as

window and traversed 3 meters of gas. The Cherenkov photons were focussed by
mirror onto the MAPMTs.

greater than 85% by COMPAS. We assume a 90% reﬂectivity as that was what
was measured for the HERA-b mirrors [2], made using a similar technology.

The transparency of a sample of the plastic used for the acrylic window with
a diﬀerent thickness, 0.37 cm, is shown as a function of wavelength in Fig. 2
along with the transparency of a 0.35 cm thick sample of glass used in the
MAPMTs, while the actual thickness used in the tubes is 0.08 cm.

Our system is designed to work in the wavelength region from approximately
280 nm to about 600 nm, where the quantum eﬃciency of the MAPMTs falls
to zero. The product of the acrylic window and MAPMT window transmission
at 280 nm is 45%, reaches 90% at 330 nm and is near zero at 260 nm.

2.3 MultiAnode-PhotoMulitplierTubes

Our 53 MAPMTs were arranged in an approximate circle, as shown in Fig. 3,
in order to accommodate most of the Cherenkov ring. A few were purposely
displaced to be able to monitor noise or backgrounds. The tubes and the elec-
tronics were water cooled. The temperature varied from 26◦-33◦C, depending
on the vertical position and was kept constant within ±0.2◦C when running
at our nominal voltage settings.

The R8900-M16 multianode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT) is a 26.2 mm ×
26.2 mm square PMT with a 0.8 mm thick borosilicate glass window and a

Bialkali (K-Cs) photocathode. The active area of the photocathode is spec-
iﬁed to be 24 mm × 24 mm. The tube is segmented into a 4 × 4 array of
independent photodetection elements. Each cell has its own 12-stage dynode
chain connected to an anode output. A photograph of the MAPMT is shown in
Fig. 4. A single HV line and a voltage divider network (VDN) provide voltages

to the photocathode and the dynodes. A schematic of the VDN is shown in
Fig. 5. In our initial studies of the tubes, and for the results presented in this
section we used resistances of 110 kΩ, 330 kΩ, 330 kΩ, and 110kΩ for R1-R4,
180 kΩ for R5-R15, 1 MΩ for R16 and 51 Ω for R17-R19, as recommended by
Hamamatsu. The capacitors, C1-C4 are all 0.01 µF, 200 V. Gains for individ-
ual tubes varied in the range 1-4× 106 at 800 V. The channel-to-channel gain
variation within a tube, averaged over all tubes, had an r.m.s. width of 16%.

For the test beam run we decided to run at lower voltages in order to have
less gain. In order to maintain full collection eﬃciency, we use a diﬀerent set
of resistances in the ﬁrst four stages (R1-R4) of 180 kΩ, 536 kΩ, 536 kΩ, and
180kΩ, the rest staying the same.

The R8900 is the result of an evolution of MAPMTs from Hamamatsu which
began with tubes with active area as low as 36% (R5900) and culminated with

5

this tube which is designed to have an active area approaching 85%.

We performed a series of bench tests including: comparison of the pulse height
spectra from channel-to-channel, determination of the active area, and mea-
surement of the sensitivity to external magnetic ﬁelds. These tests were per-
formed using a low-intensity blue LED whose light was transported inside a
dark-box along a single-mode optical ﬁber. The tip of the ﬁber was pointed at
the center of each channel and the pulse height spectra was measured using a
PCI-based ADC card. The voltage was set to 850 V for these initial measure-
ments. The pulse height spectra for one of the MAPMTs is shown in Fig. 6.
The channel-to-channel gain variations are at the level of 15-20%. Most of the
channels have a well-deﬁned peak and valley, although channels 6, 10, and
12 have a larger fraction of low pulse height signals. This is not a signiﬁcant
problem since the VA MAPMT chip (see Section 2.5) which is used for the
MAPMT readout can operate at low threshold.

To investigate the active area of the tube and the magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity, the
signals from the MAPMT were read out using CAMAC and a LabVIEW-based
DAQ. The CAMAC system includes an ampliﬁer (LeCroy #612A), discrim-
inator (Phillips Scientiﬁc, #710) and scaler (LeCroy #2551). The threshold
was set to a relatively high value, which resulted in some clipping of low pulse
height signals, although for these studies, we were mainly interested in relative
response.

For the active area determination, we scan over the face of the MAPMT
in steps of 0.25 mm in both X and Y. The light from the ﬁber was passed
through an additional collimator which provided, on the face of the tube, an
approximately Gaussian shaped spot in both X and Y dimensions with an
r.m.s. width of about 150 µm. For each point we measure the total number of
counts above the discriminator threshold in a time interval of 2 seconds. The
dark count rate was typically about 40 Hz and was therefore neglected. The
results of a typical scan are shown in Fig. 7 where we plot the integrated count
rate as a function of the (X,Y) coordinates of the spot. The outline of the tube
is evident. A 24 mm square box is superimposed, which shows that the active
area in X is about 24 mm, while in Y it is closer to 23 mm. The asymmetry
of the dynode structure may account for this diﬀerence. These data indicate
that 80% of the tube’s physical area is active.

The individual channel responses are more clearly illustrated in Fig. 8, where
we project out a slice of Fig. 7 along (a) X and (b) Y, such that the slice
passes through the center of a row and a column. The unshaded histogram
shows the integrated count rate for all channels and the shaded histograms
show the contributions from the individual channels in that particular row
or column. The sharp drop oﬀ at the edge of the photocathode conﬁrms the
small spot size. Near the border of neighboring channels, we observe a region

of ambiguity where a photon can be focused onto the ﬁrst dynode of either
channel. Once in that channel, it is expected that the signal will be collected
on the corresponding anode. To quantify this eﬀect, we ﬁt the edge to an error
function and extract an r.m.s. width of 0.75 mm, after a small correction for
the size of the light spot (∼0.15 mm). Alternately, we compute the fraction
of counts which falls outside the geometric edge of a channel relative to the
total counts within the 6 mm x 6 mm boundary. We ﬁnd that about 5% of the
counts spill over into a neighboring channel for each edge. Therefore, for an
interior channel, about 20% of the total counts are detected on neighboring
channels. These photons are generally close to the periphery, as indicated by
the roll oﬀ at the edge of the channels (see Fig. 8). This leads to a small

7

degradation in the positional resolution of this device relative to one which
has no spill over.

been background subtracted (see text).

Lastly, we report on measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld sensitivity of the
R8900-M16 MAPMT. For use in BTeV, we required the tubes to perform well
in an external ﬁeld as large as 10 Gauss. We studied three corner channels
(channels 1, 13, and 16), one non-corner edge channel (channel 3) and one
interior channel (channel 10). The tests consisted of measuring the count rate
from a pulsed LED with zero ﬁeld and then with a known ﬁeld provided by
a pair of Helmholtz coils. We investigated both the orientation parallel to the
axis of the tube (longitudinal ﬁeld)and perpendicular (transverse ﬁeld).

The eﬃciency was mildly dependent upon the transverse ﬁeld, dropping by
∼10% with a transverse ﬁeld of 15 Gauss for a corner channel, and by less

than 5% for interior channels. On the other hand, signiﬁcant losses in collection
were observed when longitudinal ﬁelds were applied.

We investigated shielding the tube with a 1 inch long 250 µm thick mu-metal
shield. The shield was electrically isolated from the outer can of the MAPMT
and was allowed to ﬂoat electrically. Count rate measurements were taken
with diﬀerent extension lengths, d, of the mu-metal tube beyond the face of
the MAPMT. Data were taken for d=0 mm, 5 mm, and 10 mm. The results are
shown in Fig. 9 for channels 1, 3, 10, and 16. Each set of data are normalized
to the count rate at zero applied ﬁeld. We ﬁnd that when the shields are not
extended (d=0 mm), the corner and edge channels incur large losses, coming

from both collection eﬃciency and a decrease in gain. As the shielding is
extended the losses are reduced, and at 10 mm, the drop in eﬃciency (at 10
Gauss) is typically less than 10%. Some channels show an increase in count
rate as compared to no ﬁeld, and hence the average loss is typically less than
5%.

the MT6B enclosure. The beam as delivered was 120 GeV protons, from the
resonant extraction of a single Booster batch in the Main Injector, with a <4%
momentum bite. The beam tune was varied somewhat during the several days
of data-taking, but typical beam rates were 5 KHz per spill, as measured by
beam counters. Spills lasted 700 ms, with 1 to 8 spills per supercycle (60 s).
The data-taking runs lasted on the order of 30 mins.

2.5 Electronics, Trigger and Data Acquisition

The MAPMTs are plugged into a custom PCB baseboard that contains the
VDN’s and signal routing. Each baseboard hosts 16 MAPMTs, a total of 256
channels, and passes the signals along a 34-conductor cable to two hybrids one
above and one below the support channel. Each hybrid hosts two 64-channel
ASICs, thus accommodating 8 MAPMTs.

The front end electronics used in the test beam is based on custom made
VA MAPMT ASICs produced at IDE AS, Norway. 2 Multiplexer boards (MUX),
designed and developed at Syracuse, provide the interface with a PCI based
data acquisition system designed and produced at Fermilab [4]. A system di-
agram describing one of the readout chains is shown in Fig. 10.

of registers that allow the customization of the readout procedure to a variety

of diﬀerent systems. The mating board (PMC) contains a large FPGA (Xilinx
Virtex PRO) that permits customization of the DAQ. We used the general
PTA ﬁrmware developed for the BTeV pixel test beam [4], but wrote the
PMC ﬁrmware suitable for our data architecture.

Two ﬁnger size scintillation counters were placed in front of the RICH tank in
the horizontal and vertical directions and an additional one arranged vertically
was placed behind the tank. They were aligned to beam particles. We also
used two larger beam deﬁning counters upstream. Our trigger was formed as
a coincidence of the beam counters and local ﬁnger counters. The trigger signal
required the coincidence of all ﬁve scintillators. The typical trigger rate was
300-500 Hz, during data-taking. The beam spot at the entrance window of the
RICH prototype tank was ∼5 mm in diameter. The r.m.s. angular divergence
of the beam was <0.25 mrad. This trigger signal was used to move the data
from the local buﬀers in the front end hybrids to the PTA memory.

2.5.1 Front End Electronics

The VA MAPMT ASICs comprise 64 mixed analog and digital processors
with parallel inputs and parallel outputs. The parameters aﬀecting its mode of
operation are loaded through an input shift register initialized at the beginning
of a data taking cycle.

Fig. 11 shows the conceptual diagram of each readout channel. The analog
section comprises a semi-gaussian preampliﬁer and shaper circuit, followed
by a high pass ﬁlter that has the purpose of reducing the sensitivity of the
discriminator to long range drifts of the DC working point of the device. In
addition, a voltage-controlled pole-zero cancellation circuit is introduced to
optimize the rate capabilities. The analog section is optimized for low noise
performance with an expected gain of 106.

The input of the digital section is a discriminator that must operate eﬀectively
at very low thresholds and it needs to tolerate very high rates, of the order of
several MHz, to cope with the high occupancy that was expected in some areas
of the BTeV RICH. The discriminator threshold is set through an external 8 bit
DAC. In addition, a 4 bit programmable DAC is built in every channel to ﬁne
tune the threshold of each individual channel to compensate for diﬀerent DC
oﬀsets. The discriminator output drives a monostable circuit that produces an
output current pulse whose width is about 100 ns. Individual digital outputs
can be disabled through a channel mask set during the initialization sequence.

There are three modes of operation for this ASIC: (1) an initialization se-
quence, when a bit pattern sequence is shifted in the ASIC to program the
desired operating conditions; (2) a calibration mode, when channels selected
in the initialization sequence respond to an input current pulse sent to the

activated and respond to charge signals collected at their inputs. In addition,
a fast-OR of all the channel hits can be activated for monitoring or synchro-
nization purposes.

Fig. 12 shows the hybrid hosting the VA MAPMT ASICs. It is a conven-
tional 6-layer rigid printed circuit board. The analog inputs receive signals
via ﬂat multiconductor cables from the baseboard that hosts the MAPMT
photon detectors and provides the high voltage biasing network for their 12
stages. Level shifter circuits are wirebonded to the VA MAPMT output pads.
They translate their current outputs into voltage levels matching the input
requirements of the XILINX Virtex 300 FPGA, use to drive the initializa-
tion sequence and they latch and transfer the data from the front end to the
back end circuit with the protocols needed by the data acquisition system.
The ﬁrmware is downloaded in the ﬁrst step of the initialization sequence and
thus we can adapt this hybrid to diﬀerent data taking modes, and diﬀerent
triggering conﬁgurations.

2.5.2 Data acquisition architecture

There are two ﬁrmware modules that were developed for this test beam to
allow for triggered data acquisition: a hybrid ﬁrmware, implementing the ASIC

prototype studied with test beam runs at Fermilab.

initialization and the timing necessary to synchronize the data ﬂow with the
trigger signal, and a PMC ﬁrmware, to interface this data structure with the
general data acquisition framework.

Two elements needed to be implemented in the hybrid ﬁrmware: a wait period
to compensate for the delay between the scintillator trigger and the prompt
binary information appearing a few ns after a charge signal exceeded the
given threshold. The binary output was only 100 ns wide, to allow for the
fast data rates expected in the real experiment, and thus it decayed before
the corresponding trigger was available at the hybrid boards. Secondly, a time
stamp mechanism was necessary to allow the combination of event fragments
from diﬀerent hybrids.

Channels registering a signal above threshold self-latched and initiated a delay
signal matching the expected trigger delay. At the end of this wait period, if
a trigger signal was asserted, the data were pushed out of the hybrid onto
the PMC board, whereas if no trigger occurred, the latches were reset and
the hybrids were ready for a new event. When a channel was latched, the
corresponding 6-bit event counter information was latched in the hybrid. The
event counters in the various hybrids were driven by a global synchroniza-
tion clock provided by one of the PMC cards, the master card. The master
card distributed the clock to the other cards which, in turn, distributed it
synchronously to all the front end hybrids.

The PMC cards received the signals coming from 2 hybrids. Their main func-
tions were the generation of an “extended time stamp,” using a 26 bit counter
synchronized with the local time stamp counter. Subsequently the formatted

14

events, including the hybrid address, were sent to the online PC for further
processing.

The DAQ software [5], originally developed for the BTeV pixel beam test,
was implemented in C++ and encompasses three main processes: Producer,
Consumer and Logger. The Producer is the component which works mostly
with the PTA/PMC pair. It sends the control signals necessary to drive the
data acquisition and receives data from the local memories. The Consumer
process reads and analyzes the data. The Logger receives messages from the
other components and notiﬁes the user in case of errors.

2.6 Gas System

A gas system was designed and built to circulate and purify the C4F8O radiator
gas. The design was intended to be open and passive, not requiring complicated
feedback with precise pressure monitoring. As a consequence, an expansion
bellows was mounted above the main RICH tank, which expanded to take up
the volume of a gas charge when injected into the system, and compensated
for variation in atmospheric conditions. A simpliﬁed schematic of the system
is shown in Fig. 13.

There are two main circuits in the system. The ﬁrst is the compression circuit,
which consists of the main RICH tank, expansion bellows, high-pressure pump,
small condensation tank, C4F8O gas bottle, and a ﬁlter pack. This is the outer
circuit shown in the ﬂow diagram. Initially the system is ﬂushed with Argon.
Filling with C4F8O gas is accomplished by pressure diﬀerential ﬂow from the
bottle through the ﬁlters to the main tank. The ﬂow rate is controlled so
as not to stress the acrylic windows on the main tank, and the expansion
bellows expands to hold the extra gas volume. When the bellows reaches its
maximum extent, the large pump is turned on, and the gas (a mixture of
Argon and C4F8O) is compressed in the small condensation tank. When the
pressure in the condensation tank reaches ∼25 psig, the C4F8O gas liquiﬁes;
and when the pressure reaches 33 psig, a relief valve opens releasing the gas
(mostly Argon) until the pressure falls below the relief level. In this way, the
ﬂuid mixture is puriﬁed of Argon (as well as any residual air).

A new C4F8O gas charge is injected from the bottle, passing through the ﬁlter
pack, and into the main tank, again ﬁlling the expansion bellows. The ﬁlter
pack consists of a coalescer, a molecular sieve and a particulate ﬁlter to re-
move water vapor and particulates from the gas. This compression process is
repeated iteratively until the required purity is reached. After a few cycles, a
valve is opened to allow the C4F8O liquid in the compression tank to vaporize
and re-enter the circuit as a new charge. In this beam test, (94 ± 2)% pu-

rity by weight was achieved asymptotically. This was the maximum possible
in the system, limited by the existence of a small volume at the top of the
condensation tank that was inaccessible to liquid.

The second circuit in the system is the circulation circuit, which consists of
the main tank, expansion bellows, ﬁlters, and a small pump. It is the inner
circuit shown in the ﬂow diagram. This circuit is run when the tank is ﬁlled
with suﬃciently puriﬁed C4F8O gas, and is intended to maintain the radiator
gas at a constant composition during data taking.

The circuits were controlled and monitored by the PLC-based iFix DMACSTM
system from General Electric-Intellution, which provided the computer inter-
face for controlling the pumps and reading the transducers for pressure, ﬂow,
temperature and humidity. A height sensor on the expansion bellows allowed
for a simple feedback loop to control the high-pressure pump. All process vari-
ables were recorded. Overall the C4F8O gas system worked well, as designed.
We did ﬁnd, however, that the expansion volume while useful for a test system
would be too cumbersome to include in the ﬁnal detector.

2.7 C4F8O Gas Compatability

Since C4F8O has never before been used as a Cherenkov radiator, its chemical
compatability with other materials needed to be investigated. To this end,
C4F8O gas was tested in contact with a variety of plastics, epoxies, metals
and other materials, as listed in Table 3 [6].

The C4F8O gas and all materials (except water) were put into the same
specially-designed gas-tight stainless steel vessels and kept at an elevated tem-
perature (80◦C) and pressure (1.2 atm) for several months to accelerate the
chemical kinetics of any possible reactions. This represented a worst-case test.
After periods lasting up to 9.6 years exposure (20◦C equivalent), the C4F8O
gas was analyzed via Gas Chromatography and Proton NMR. No measurable
amounts of reaction products were obeserved. The materials exposed were
tested for relevant physical properties: change in dimensions, weight, epoxy
strength, and optical transmission (e.g., UVT acrylic). No measurable mate-
rial changes were detected, 3 and no optical changes were seen larger than the
sample-to-sample variation (<2% above 290 nm, <5% below).

Water is a special concern for C4F8O, since the Oxygen atom was thought to
make it potentially reactive, forming HF. However, in a separate test with only
water exposure to C4F8O gas for up to 13.5 years equivalent, gas chromatogra-
phy analysis found the total contaminants picked up by the gas to be <50 ppm
(resolution of the device), and proton NMR studies gave no indication of any
H-based contaminants. There was no measurable HF production.

3 There was a slight eﬀect, however, in lightening the color of the surface of the
Copper tube after 4 years equivalent exposure. Electron-dispersive X-ray analysis
did not indicate the presence of Fluorine on the Copper surface to a depth of 1 µm.
A control vessel ﬁlled with dry N2 exhibited a similar result. This is most simply
understood as a temperature induced eﬀect.

Thus determination of the expected separation requires knowledge of the index
of refraction, properly weighted by the wavelength acceptance and the fact
that Cherenkov light is generated with a 1/λ2 spectrum.

We have measured the refractive indices of C4F8O, C4F10 and also C4F8 at
three diﬀerent wavelengths using a Michelson interferometer. The results are
shown in Fig. 14. The curve is an analytical expression for the C4F10 index
based on extrapolating DELPHI measurements of the C4F10 index in the ul-
traviolet region of the spectrum [8]. We use this curve to model the wavelength
dependence of the index of refraction as we do not have measurements over
all the detector bandwidth, which extends down to 280 nm. We are mostly
insensitive to the actual value of the index, but need to model the wavelength
dependence to estimate the chromatic aberration.

The ability to identify particles depends not only on their inherent separation
in Cherenkov angle, but also upon the resolution provided by the system.
We model the expected resolution by using a full Monte-Carlo simulation of
the radiation and detection of Cherenkov photons. The quantum eﬃciency
of the MAPMTs as a function of wavelength is shown in Fig. 15; it includes
the cutoﬀ due to the boroscilicate window. The curve is based on Hamamatsu
measurements. The collection eﬃciency of electrons to the ﬁrst dynode reduces
the yield by an additional 70%. The gas transmission is assumed to be 100%
in our wavelength region. Using these numbers as input, for a 3 meter long
C4F8O radiator at room temperature we expect to detect 46.3 photoelectrons
for a high momentum track with an angular resolution per photon of 0.75 mr.
Therefore, after averaging over all the photons, a resolution in Cherenkov angle
per track of 0.103 mr is expected, giving 4.2σ separation between 70 GeV/c
pions and kaons. We note that the resolution has almost equal contributions

of 0.5 mr from the index of refraction variation with wavelength (chromatic
abberation), the spatial error in detecting the photons and the emission point
error, which exists even in this focusing system and is magniﬁed by the fact
that the mirror is tilted by 442 mr in order to focus on the MAPMT detector
plane.

For our test situation the number of photons will be somewhat less because
of imperfect coverage of our photon detector and also because the gas will
not be totally puriﬁed. For our measured gas mixture of (94±2)% C4F8O and
6% Argon, and a phototube array coverage of 93.6%, we expect 40.5 detected
photons each with a resolution of 0.75 mr, yielding an expected track resolution
of 0.11 mr.

4 OPERATING POINT DETERMINATION: HIGH VOLTAGE

AND THRESHOLD OPTIMIZATION

While in principle it should be able to operate the MAPMT system at sub-
stantial gain, we ﬁnd that large pulses can saturate the electronics causing
rather large voltage spikes to be reﬂected back on the input cables between
the MAPMT and the hybrids. These sharp voltage swings then capacitively

couple to neighboring lines causing extra hits in these channels, a phenomenon
that we call “cross-talk.” Thus determining an optimal high voltage for the
system is very important. This problem is addressed in a subsequent version
of the VA MAPMT ASICs which have their dynamic ranges optimized for
higher gains. For the rare remaining residual saturation occurrences, using a
cable with less cross-talk would also be beneﬁcial.

Although each of our 53 tubes has a somewhat diﬀerent gain as a function of
voltage, it was adequate to group them into three categories: low gain, medium
gain and high gain, designated as HV1, HV2, HV3, respectively.

To investigate the performance as a function of high voltage we took data
at diﬀerent settings. Ring images appeared at each setting. Fig. 16 shows a
typical event. With our nominal threshold setting little if no noise is evident.

The photon yield can be characterized by counting the number of hit channels.
We also deﬁne a “cluster” by grouping hits together if they are in adjacent
electronic channels. We are not grouping here necessarily the channels on the
MAPMT surface. What we are doing is grouping the channels only by elec-
tronic address which is one dimensional rather than two dimensional. While
this does inevitably group some real photons together it provides a useful way,
in the presence of cross-talk, of searching for a region where our performance is
independent of high voltage, usually called a plateau. We also use the average
cluster size.

Fig. 17 shows the number of hits, the number of clusters and the average
cluster size for each of the three groupings of tubes as a function of high
voltage. We choose to use 800 V, 750 V and 700 V as nominal settings for the

three groups, respectively.

A blue LED was employed to independently evaluate the size of the cross-talk
induced eﬀects. The setting was such that only zero or one photon was typically
detected on any single tube in each pulse. The cluster size as a function of
voltage is shown in Fig. 18. We estimate that at our nominal voltage setting
only 5% of the observed photons are due to cross-talk.

The threshold setting controls the level for which signals are counted. In Fig. 19
we show the variation in the number of hits, number of clusters and cluster size
as a function of threshold from beam data. (The threshold voltage is negative;
more negative values result in higher thresholds.) The nominal threshold is
-7.85 mV which corresponds to 49,100 electrons. This threshold is at least ten
times smaller than the mean charge expected from a single photon. We tried to
use a lower threshold, but did not see any eﬃciency improvement. Our results

5 RESULTS

5.1 Refractive Index

We determine the eﬀective refractive index from a ﬁt to the diameter of the
Cherenkov rings, after correction to nominal pressure (1 atm) and temperature
(22◦C). After correcting for the (6±2)% of Argon, we ﬁnd that the index of
refraction for C4F8O is 1.001389±0.000024 for the wavelength interval of 280 -
600 nm weighted by the 1/λ2 input Cherenkov light distribution, the window
transparencies and the MAPMT eﬃciencies. The value obtained here is con-
sistent with the measurements obtained using the Michelson interferometer
(see Fig. 14).

5.2 Photon Yield and Cherenkov Angular Resolutions

The photon yield for an ensemble of tracks is shown in Fig. 20. The large
shaded peak corresponds to single tracks with a mean value of 43.1 photons,
having a Gaussian r.m.s. of 6.5 photons. The second peak is due to two tracks
arriving close in time. Although we predict 86.2 photons in this peak, a Monte
Carlo simulation taking into account that the tracks are very closely correlated
in both space and angle shows that we expect only 76.9 photons, due to
overlapping photons, consistent with our observations. There is also a small
tail toward low hit numbers due to bad triggers or event fragments.

Selecting photons about the mean Cherenkov angle for photons generated by
the track, each within three standard deviations of the single photon reso-

the overlap possibility.

lution, we ﬁnd 43.1 photons per track. The Monte Carlo expectation is 40.5
photons. The 6.5% excess we observe is consistent with the expected cross-
talk, but may also be due to a somewhat higher MAPMT quantum eﬃciency
or mirror reﬂectivity than expected.

The angular resolution per photon is shown in Fig. 21 (a). It is determined by
plotting the measured Cherenkov angle for each photon minus the expected
Cherenkov angle, determined by knowledge of the incident track angle. We
measure an angular resolution per photon of 0.79 mr while the Monte Carlo
expectation, shown in (b) is 0.75 mr. [9]. The diﬀerence is consistent with
being due to the ∼5% cross-talk.

The Cherenkov angle per track is determined by averaging all detected photons
within three standard deviations of the single photon resolution. In Fig. 22
we show the measured Cherenkov angle for each track minus the expected
Cherenkov angle. The angular resolution per track is 0.1164±0.0004 mr as
determined by a ﬁt to a single Gaussian. It is slightly poorer than the Monte
Carlo expectation of 0.112 mr.

We now examine the track resolution as a function of high voltage. Fig. 23
shows the number of hits, the Cherenkov angular resolution per photon and
the Cherenkov angular resolution per track as a function of HV2, the high
voltage applied to group 2. All groups are included here, however with HV1
being 50 V higher and HV3 50 V lower.

Viewed in terms of the angular resolution per track the voltage plateau ex-
tends over a range of 100 V. Any higher or lower voltage results in a poorer

6 CONCLUSIONS

We have constructed a focussed ring imaging Cherenkov detector and exposed
it to a 120 GeV/c proton beam at Fermilab. Using a 3 meters length of C4F8O
gas radiator and R8900-M16 multianode photomultiplier tubes we measure
about 43.5 photons per track with an angular resolution of 0.79 mr per photon
and a track resolution of 0.116 mr. We expect that 5% of the photons were
generated by cross-talk largely due to a mismatch between the dynamic range
of the front-end electronics and the gain of the MAPMTs. The gas contained
6% Argon and the photon detector covered 93.6% of a circle. In a ﬁnal system
the Argon would be eliminated and the phototube coverage would be complete.

Based on these measurements, if we used pure gas and had complete photon
coverage, we would expect to have 46.6 photons and an angular resolution
per track of 0.109 mr. Our simulation using these parameters gives the same
number of photons and a slightly better track resolution of 0.103 mr, since
the simulation here doesn’t include the cross-talk. This system would be an
excellent identiﬁer of particles.

Sometimes the parameter N0 = Nγ/L sin2 θ, where Nγ is the number of de-
tected photons, L the detector length and θ the Cherenkov angle is used to
characterize RICH systems [10]. This system would have an N0 of 58/cm. The
usefulness of a RICH system, however, is given by its ability to separate parti-
cles. N0 is only part of the system design. It can be increased, for example, by
using photons at shorter wavelengths but the chromatic abberations associ-
ated with such a change would make the particle separation properties of the
system worse, rather than better. At 70 GeV/c incident particle momentum

26

s
s
the angular separation between pions and kaons in C4F8O is 0.421 mr. This
system would provide a separation corresponding to 4σ separation.

The R8900-M16 MAPMT from Hamamatsu has been shown to be an excellent
photon detector, especially when coupled to low noise electronics. Bench tests
conﬁrm that the MAPMT has an active area of about 80% and the response
over this area is quite uniform. For the four central channels about 20% of
the photons are detected in one of the adjacent channel. The edge and corner
channels have approximately a 15%, and 10% out-of-channel detection rate,
respectively. This results in an acceptably small degradation in the positional
resolution of the device. Lastly, we have found that these tubes can be ad-
equately shielded for operation in environments which have magnetic ﬁelds.
Shielding against the longitudinal component generally requires extending the
tube beyond the face of the MAPMT. As long as photons are not incident at
large angles, the loss due to shadowing is generally small (it was found to be
at the level of 5% for the BTeV RICH).

Lastly we found that C4F8O is an excellent gas for Cherenkov detectors with
a relatively large refractive index, and appears to be compatible with most
materials.

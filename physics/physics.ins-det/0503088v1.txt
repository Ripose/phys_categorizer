Abstract

The demands on detectors for particle detection as well as for medical and astro-
nomical X-ray imaging are continuously pushing the development of novel pixel
detectors. The state of the art in pixel detector technology to date are hybrid pixel
detectors in which sensor and read-out integrated circuits are processed on diﬀer-
ent substrates and connected via high density interconnect structures. While these
detectors are technologically mastered such that large scale particle detectors can
be and are being built, the demands for improved performance for the next gener-
ation particle detectors ask for the development of monolithic or semi-monolithic
approaches. Given the fact that the demands for medical imaging are diﬀerent in
some key aspects, developments for these applications, which started as particle
physics spin-oﬀ, are becomming rather independent. New approaches are leading to
novel signal processing concepts and interconnect technologies to satisfy the need
for very high dynamic range and large area detectors. The present state in hybrid
and (semi-)monolithic pixel detector development and their diﬀerent approaches for
particle physics and imaging application is reviewed.

1 Hybrid Pixel Detectors for tracking applications

The development of hybrid pixel detectors over the last 10 years was mainly
pushed by the speciﬁcations for the vertex detectors for the large high energy
physics experiments ALICE [1,2], ATLAS [3,4], CMS [5,6], LHCb [7] and ﬁxed
target experiment NA60 [8,9] at the LHC at CERN and the BTeV detector at
the TEVATRON [10]. All these experiments have a high demand on spatial
resolution, timing precision and radiation tolerance. Also the feasibility of
building large detector areas (up to ∼2m2) had to be proven. The hybrid
pixel technology, where electronic chip and sensor elements are on diﬀerent
substrates which are connected via ﬂip-chip assembly, showed to be mature
enough to comply with all these demands. The pixel detectors, which are
closest to the interaction region of a collider experiment, comprise of typically
2 to 3 cylindrical layers and additional disk layers for the forward and backward
region. The pixel sizes are between 50µm × 400µm and 100µm × 150µm for
the mentioned experiments to achieve the spatial resolution which is required
for eﬃcient identiﬁcation of short lived particles (b-tagging for Higgs and
SUSY signals) and robust event reconstruction at high luminosities.

Fig. 1. Prototype of the ATLAS front-end chip (left). Dispersion of the pixel thresh-
olds before and after tunning (right).

Apart from the electronical requirements on the pixel electronics [11] like low
power consumption (< 50µW per pixel), low noise and threshold dispersion
(together < 200e), zero suppression in every pixel, on-chip hit buﬀering and
suﬃcient timing precision for LHC bunch crossing rates (25 ns), the essential
radiation hardness has been a major challenge for the design of front-end chips.
This could be achieved with special design techniques and the use of deep sub-
micron CMOS technologies, which superseeded dedicated radhard processes.
Figure 1 shows a picture of a prototype ATLAS pixel chip and a measurement
of the threshold distribution which is a measure for the homogeneity of the
chip response. The dispersion of about 600 e− can be lowered to below 50
e− by a 7-bit tuning feature implemented in the chip. This is well below the

2

electronic noise of about 170 e−.

Figure 2 shows the improvement of the radiation tolerance of the sensor mate-
rial by the use of oxygenated silicon which has less sensitivity to non-inoizing
energy loss of charged particles [12]. The sensor pixels are implanted as n+
electrodes in n-bulk material. After type inversion which occurs after about
Φeq = 2.5 × 1013cm−2 the diode junction is at the electrode side, allowing the
partial depleted operation of the detector with less than 600 V after ten years
of LHC operation.

Fig. 2. Depletion voltage versus 1 MeV neutron equivalent ﬂux.

The assembly of the sensor modules is done by ﬁne pitch bumping and ﬂip-
chipping the electronic chips and the sensor. Mainly two diﬀerent technologies
are used to build sensor modules in large scales: Solder (PbSn) bumping [13]
with reﬂow and Indium bumping [14,15] with optional reﬂow [16] and thermal
compression. Fig. 3 shows rows of 50µm pitch bumps obtained by these tech-
niques. All technologies have been successfully used with 8” IC-wafers and 4”
sensor wafers. A module for the ATLAS or CMS pixel detector is composed of
16 front-end chips bump-bonded to one silicon sensor with an area of typically
2 cm × 6.5 cm. As shown in Fig. 4 a kapton ﬂex circuit which supports a mod-
ule control chip is glued on the backside of the sensor. Wire bonds connect
the front-end chip I/O lines and a high density interconnect adapter (pigtail)
to the ﬂex circuit.

To minimize the radiation induced damage of the sensors due to the harsh
radiation environment the mechanical support structure for the modules also
has to provide cooling to temperatures below the freezing point. To compen-
sate this additional material budget the front-end chips are thinned down to
180 µm giving a total thickness of the module at normal incidence of about
2 − 3% X0.

2 Imaging with Hybrid Pixel Detectors

With the design of pixel chip electronics for vertex trackers the capability of
detecting individual radiation quanta made hybrid pixel detectors also very
attractive for non-HEP applications like medical X-ray imagers or synchrotron
radiation detectors. The counting principle leads to superior performance of
such detectors compared to standard ﬁlm-foil or scintillator-CCD systems that
are normally used for imaging: an in principal unlimited dynamic range and
full linearity in their response function.

While in tracking applications the timing information (and optional the energy
loss) of an incident particle is measured within every pixel, most of the present
imaging applications are based on counting the individual quanta for a certain
exposure time intervall. Therefore the ﬁrst implementations of counting pixel
detectors simply replaced the digital part of the pixel electronic of a vertex
tracker pixel chip, which generates the timestamp for each individual event, by
a counter [17][18]. The same principle is also used for protein-crystallography

4

with synchrotron radiation [19,20]. But for successful development of an op-
timized imaging system based on a hybrid pixel detector one has to obey the
diﬀerent demands for both application areas. Table 1 gives a summary of the
diﬀerent system aspects and subsequent demands on the pixel electronics and
sensor charcteristics for tracking and imaging applications, respectively.

Comparison of the demands on pixel detectors for tracking and imaging applications

Conventional X-ray imagers integrate the energy of the absorbed quanta. The
so called Active Matrix Flat Panel Imager [21,22,23,24], which represents
the state-of-the-art in digital X-ray detectors, exploits two diﬀerent detec-
tion methods: indirect conversion, where a scintillator (e.g. CsI) is deposited
atop a TFT photo diode array, and direct conversion where an absorber (e.g.
Selenium) converts the incident X-rays to a charge which is collected with an
TFT capacitor array [25]. Due to the principle of accumulating the incident
particles, the rate capability of integrating imagers is practically unlimited. To
be competitive with these detectors the counting approach needs to meet the
high count rates (∼ 10 MHz/mm2) and the high dynamic range of at least 15
bit. In addition these detectors should combine low noise and low thresholds
with a very low threshold dispersion to allow homogenous imaging.

counting single chip module (14x14 mm2)[30]. (b) MPEC 2x2 multi chip module

Medical Imaging

Besides the superior signal to noise ﬁgures, which reach the quantum limit,
the counting principle oﬀers the fundamental advantage of attaining and ex-
ploiting an additional spectral information from the incident X-ray photons.
In the simplest implementation a diﬀerential energy measurement is realized
with a double threshold [26,27,28] which can enhance the contrast of an im-
age as the X-ray energy spectrum is diﬀerent behind diﬀerent absorbers (e.g.
bone or soft tissue). The next step towards the use of the spectral informa-
tion could be the implementation of more discrete energy bins and the use of
an energy weighting technique which has the potential to enhance the image
contrast [29]. A homogeneous response of the absorber material, low threshold
dispersion and control of the charge shared between adjacent pixels is crucial
however. Also a high photon absorption eﬃciency is mandatory for radiogra-
phy requiring the use of high-Z sensor materials like CdTe or CZT. With these
materials the development of large area detectors and their hybridization is
still a challenging task.

There are serveral counting pixel system development eﬀorts for medical appli-
cations. Among those projects two chip developments exhibit a rather mature
R&D status: the MEDIPIX collaboration [32,28] uses the MEDIPIX2 chip
with 256×256, 55×55µm2 pixels fabricated in 0.25µm technology, energy win-
dowing via two tunable discriminator thresholds, and a 13 bit counter. The
maximum count rate per pixel is about 1 MHz. Fig. 5(a) shows an image of
a 57Co (122 keV γ) 1 mm diameter point source obtained with the Medipix2
single chip bonded to a 14x14 mm2 CdTe sensor [30]. A Multi-Chip module
with 2x2 chips using high-Z CdTe sensors with the MPEC chip [31] is shown
in Fig. 5(b). The MPEC chip features 32 × 32 pixels (200×200µm2), double
threshold operation, 18-bit counting at ∼1 MHz per pixel as well as low noise

values (∼120e with CdTe sensor) and threshold dispersion (21e after tuning)
[18,31]. A technical issue here is the bumping of individual die CdTe sensors
which has been solved using Au-stud bumping with In-topping [33].

Protein Crystallography

Protein Chrystallography is another appealing application for counting pixel
detectors. For the imaging of Bragg spots from X-ray photons of ∼12 keV
(corresponding to resolutions at the 1˚A range) or higher, scattered oﬀ pro-
tein crystals, with high rate (∼1-1.5 MHz/pixel) and high dynamic range [19],
photon counting detectors have fundamental advantages over conventional in-
tegrating detector systems. That is the high linearity of the counting method
and the absence of so-called ”blooming-eﬀects”, i.e. the response of non-hit
pixels in the close neighborhood of a Bragg spot. For a typical bragg spot
the size of a diﬀraction maximum is 100 − 200µm, calling for pixel sizes in
the order of 100 − 300µm, which is well achievable with today’s hybrid pixel
detectors. A systematic limitation and diﬃculty is the problem that homoge-
neous hit/count responses in all pixels, also for hits at the pixel boundaries
or between pixels where charge sharing plays a role must be maintained by
delicate threshold tuning (Fig. 6(b)). Counting pixel developments are made
for ESRF (Grenoble, France) [34,35] and SLS (Swiss Light Source at the Paul-
Scherrer Institute, Switzerland) beam lines. A photograph of the PILATUS
1M detector [36] at the SLS (∼ 106 217µm ×217µm pixels, 18 modules, 20×24
cm2 area) is shown in Fig. 6(a). It is the ﬁrst large scale hybrid pixel detector
in operation. Fig. 6(c) shows some Bragg spots obtained from a Lysozyme
crystal with 10s exposure to 12 keV sychrotron X-rays [37].

3 Trends in Hybrid Pixel Detectors

With their mature technology Hybrid Pixel detectors prove to be the State of
the Art in 2D sensor systems. However there are some general limitations and
challenges for special applications. Hybrid Pixel detectors are an expensive
and complex technology, last but not least due to yield issues of the many
production steps (chip, sensor, bumping, ﬂip-chip). Also the achievable spa-
tial resolution is limited to about 10µm with pixel geometries of 100 − 300µm
(with analog R/O). Where large area detectors are built, complex mechanical
structures are required to provide seamless coverage of the solid angle. For
imaging applications it is even more crucuial to use seamless large area detec-
tors without tiling to optimize the image reconstruction. In addition, tracking
applications impose a tight speciﬁcation on the material budget which is not
optimal with Hybrid Pixel detectors. Also the inevitable cooling for operation

crystallography using counting hybrid pixel detector modules, (a) delicate threshold
tuning with counting pixel detectors at the borders in between pixels, (b) Bragg
spots of an image of Lysozyme taken with PILATUS 1M [37] are often contained in
one pixel.

of Si detectors under strong irradiation adds to that material budget. Several
ideas and developments are being pursued to address i.a. some of the issues
stated above:

HAPS

MCM-D

Hybrid (Active) Pixel Sensors (HAPS) [38] exploit capacitive coupling between
pixels – similar to the same technique often used with silicon micro strip
detectors – to obtain smaller pixel cells and pixel pitch with a larger readout
pitch resulting in interleaved pixels. The pixel pitch is designed for best spatial
resolution using charge sharing between neighbors while the readout pitch
is tailored to the needs for the size of the front-end electronics cell. This
way resolutions between 3µm and 10µm can be obtained with pixel (readout)
pitches of 100µm (200µm).

The present hybrid-pixel modules of the LHC experiments use an additional
ﬂex-kapton ﬁne-print layer on top of the Si-sensor (Fig. 7(a)) to provide power
and signal distribution to and from the module front-end chips. An alternative
to the ﬂex-kapton solution is the so-called Multi-Chip-Module Technology
deposited on Si-substrate (MCM-D) [39]. A multi-conductor-layer structure is
built up on the silicon sensor. This allows to bury all bus structures in four
layers in the inactive area of the module thus avoiding the kapton ﬂex layer
and any wire bonding at the expense of a small thickness increase of 0.1% X0
(Fig. 7(b)). The extra freedom in routing also allows to design pixel detectors
which have the same pixel dimensions throughout the sensor. Fig. 7(c) shows a
scanning electron microphotograph (courtesy IZM, Berlin) of an MCM-D via
structure, and Fig. 7(d) shows the photograph of an assembled ATLAS MCM-
D module [40]. This concept also provides the possibility to build detector
modules which have non equal area ratios of sensor and electronic chips when
the routing layer implements a fan-out between the electronic pixels and the
corresponding sensor elements. With this approach it would be possible to
build large area modules with n×m chips and almost 100% active area (Fig.
8).

3-D Silicon Detectors, Active Edge

So called 3-D detectors provide a lateral drift ﬁeld between their needle like
alternating p+ and n+ electrodes which have a typical pitch of 50µm [41]

(Fig. 9). Thus they exhibit a very fast charge collection (1 - 2 ns) at low de-
pletion voltages (< 10 V) which make them well suited for harsh radiation
environments. They are build using micromechanical systems technology in-
volving the use of support wafers and reactive ion etching which makes their
fabrication more complex compared to standard planar processes. The same
technology can be used to extend the sensitive area of a detector within 10 µm
of its edge which leads to a so called active-edge detector [42].

polysilicon. Their typical pitch is 50 µm.

4 Monolithic and Semi-Monolithic Pixel Detectors

The ultimate goal of a detector development would be the integration of sen-
sor, amplifying electronic and read-out logic on one single substrate in a tech-
nology which would be commercially available. So far diﬀerent attempts to
develop such monolithic pixel detectors have been undertaken. Much of these
eﬀorts are inﬂuenced by R&D for vertex tracking detectors at future collid-
ers such as a International Linear e+e− Collider (ILC) [43]. These detectors
require a very low material budget per layer (≪1% X0), small pixel sizes
(∼20µm×20µm) and a very high rate capability (80 hits/mm2/ms) yielding
challenging requirements on the sensor and the electronics circuitry.

The diﬀerent monolithic approaches can be characterized according to some
fundamental features regarding the charge collection process and the com-
plexity of electronic circuitry. One distinction is based upon the fact whether
full CMOS circuitry is allowed (also in the pixel active area) and if the ap-
proach is based on or at least compatible with a standard process technology.
The other basic criterion is the charge collection process and thus the amount
(and uniformity) of the generated signal. Charge collection occurs either in a
fully depleted bulk providing a large signal or in a thin undepleted epi-layer,
respectively amorphous-Si layer, which leads to smaller signals. The above
mentioned ultimate monolithic goal would be fulﬁlled with a full CMOS com-
mercial standard device with charge collection in a fully depleted bulk.

- Non-standard CMOS on high resistivity bulk

The ﬁrst monolithic pixel detector was successfully operated in a particle
beam already in 1992 [44] using a high resistivity p-type bulk p-i-n detector
in which the junction had been created by an n-type diﬀusion layer. On
one side, an array of ohmic contacts to the substrate served as collection

11

electrodes. Due to this only pMOS transistor circuits sitting in n-wells were
possible to be integrated in the active area. The technology was certainly
non-standard and non-commercial. No further development emerged.

- Standard CMOS technology with charge collection in epi-layer

Certain CMOS technologies oﬀer a lightly doped epitaxial silicon layer of a
few to 15µm thickness between the low resistivity silicon bulk and the pla-
nar processing layer which can be used for charge collection [45,46,47]. The
generated charge is kept in a thin epi-layer atop the low resistivity silicon
bulk by potential wells at the boundary and reaches an n-well collection
diode by thermal diﬀusion (cf. Fig. 10(a)). The sensor is depleted only di-
rectly under the n-well diode. The signal charge is hence very small (<1000e)
and mostly incomplete; low noise electronics is the challenge in this devel-
opment. Collaborating groups around IReS&LEPSI [48,49], RAL [50] and
Irvine-LBNL-Ohio [51] use similar approaches to develop large scale CMOS
active pixels also called MAPS (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors) [46]. Pro-
totype detectors have been produced in 0.6µm, 0.35µm and 0.25µm CMOS
technologies [52,53].

Matrix readout of MAPS is performed using a standard 3-transistor cir-
cuit (line select, source-follower stage, reset) commonly employed by CMOS
matrix devices, but can also include current ampliﬁcation and current mem-
ory [52]. For an image two complete frames are subtracted from each other
(CDS) which suppresses switching noise. Noise ﬁgures of 10-30e and S/N
∼20 have been achieved with spatial resolutions below 5µm. Regarding ra-
diation hardness MAPS appear to sustain non-ionizing radiation (NIEL) to
∼1012neq while the eﬀects of ionizing radiation damage (IEL) are at present
still under investigation. The present focus of further development lies in
making larger area devices for instance by stitching over reticle boundaries
[53], increasing the charge collection performance in the epi-layer by triple-
well [50], photo-gate [54], and photo-FET [52,49] techniques and developing
a higher radiation tolerance. In addition, for applications like e.g. precise
beam position monitoring in hadron therapy, devices with very thin en-
trance windows are needed to detect ∼20 keV electrons scattering oﬀ a thin
metal foil held in the hadron beam. Such a thinned MAPS detector, which
is also capable of autoradiographic tritium detection, is shown in Fig. 10(b).
Being a standard CMOS process this approach has the potential to build
large area detectors at low costs (∼25$ per cm2). On the other hand the
thickness of the epi-layer is technology dependent and scales with the de-
creasing feature size of future processes hence further reducing the available
signal charge. Another drawback of this approach is the fact that despite
using CMOS technology the potential of full CMOS circuitry in the active
area is not available (only nMOS) because of the n-well/p-epi collecting
diode which does not permit other n-wells. Nevertheless improved readout
concepts and device development for high rate particle detection at a linear
collider are under development [43]. As a concrete project for an experiment

electronics with low resistivity bulk material. The charge is generated and collected

thin backside entrance window.

the STAR micro vertex detector upgrade plans the use of CMOS active pix-
els [52].

- Non-standard SOI on high resitivity bulk

To join the features of full charge collection and the utilization of true full
CMOS circuitry the authors of [55] propose the development of sensors using
a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer with an high resestivity bulk material. SOI
process technology which has been developed in favor for advanced high-
speed and low-power circuits uses special wafers with a thin monolithic Si
layer (50 nm – 1.5 µm) atop a buried oxide (SiO2) layer. This layer eﬀectively
isolates the electronically active SOI layer from the bulk material rendering
it a pure mechanical support. The idea of this development approach is
to use a high resistivity material for the support wafer to achieve a fully
depletable charge generation layer of suitable thickness (200–300µm). The
charge collection will be obtained by vias which connect the high resitivity
bulk with electronic circuits through the insulation layer (Fig. 11). Present
results are based also on a non-standard SOI technology but this interesting
development is still in its beginnings and might have the potential to become
compatible with commercial process technologies [56].

- Amorphous silicon on standard CMOS ASICs

A development approach which is compatible with standard CMOS technol-
ogy is based on the deposition of the sensor material as an amorphous ﬁlm
direct on the surface of the readout ASIC. Hydrogenated amorphous-Silicon
(a-Si:H) has been studied as a sensor material long ago and has gained inter-
est again [58,59] with the advancement in low noise, low power electronics.
With the deposited ﬁlm being only <30µm thick the collected charge is
in the range of only 500-1500 electrons which makes ultra low-noise elec-
tronic inevitable. A cross section through a typical a-Si:H device is shown

13

in Fig. 12. Although not a entirely monolithic concept the amorphous sil-
icon on standard CMOS ASICs approach lacks the demanding process of
hybridization. Also the radiation hardness of these detectors appears to be
very high >1015cm−2 due to the defect tolerance and defect reversing ability
of the amorphous structure and the larger band gap (1.8 eV). For high-Z
applications poly-crystalline HgI2 constitutes a possible semiconductor ﬁlm
material. The potential advantages are small thickness, radiation hardness,
and low cost. The development is still in its beginnings and – as for CMOS
active pixel sensors – a real challenge to analog VLSI design.

CMOS VLSI electronics [58,59].

- Ampliﬁcation transistor implanted in high resistivity bulk

The basic idea of this development approach is the integration of the ﬁrst
amplifying transistor of the readout electronic into the sensor substrate.

14

This so-called DEPFET pixel sensors [60] have a JFET or MOSFET tran-
sistor implanted in every pixel on a sidewards depleted [61] bulk. Electrons
generated by radiation in the bulk are collected in a potential minimum
underneath the transistor. This potential minimum acts as an internal gate
and the collected charge is modulating the channel current (Fig. 13). With
additional contacts of the external gate and a so-called clear contact individ-
ual transistors in a 2-D matrix can be selected for readout and subsequently
reseted. The bulk is fully depleted rendering large signals and at the same
time the small capacitance of the internal gate oﬀers low noise operation.
With round single pixel structures noise ﬁgures of 2.2e at room temperature
and energy resolutions of 131 eV for 6 keV X-rays have been obtained [62].
This features make DEPFET pixel detectors a competitive sensor system for
applications which demand excellent energy resolution like X-ray astronomy
[63] or biomedical autoradiography [64]. Also for the use as a vertex detec-
tor at the Future Linear Collider the DEPFET pixel detectors are under
investigation [65,62]. They would allow for thinned detectors (∼50µm [66])
to comply with the tight material budget and a very low power operation of
a row-wise switched matrix [67,62]. The sensor technology is non-standard
and the operation of DEPFET pixel detectors requires separate steering
and ampliﬁcation ICs.

5 Summary

The development of Hybrid Pixel technology had its origin in the demand
for high performance vertex detectors for particle physics experiments. Along
with it came large advancements in the development of low noise electronics,
hybridization technology and understanding and control of radiation eﬀects
in sensor material and readout electronics. Also new application areas like X-
ray astronomy, medical imaging and protein chrystallography emerged which

require well adapted electronic concepts to cope with the varying demands
on energy resolution and rate capability. This new range of applications and
the increasing demand on the performance of future vertex detectors leads
to new development trends. Some of them are enhancements to the Hybrid
Pixel technology, as the sensor and electronic chip are still diﬀerent entities:
MCM-D structures allow large area modules and 3-D sensors with active edges
improve the active/inactive area ratio and the radiation tolerance. Other in-
teresting developments lead to monolithic detetion systems: MAPS sensors
which employ the epi-layer of a standard CMOS technology for signal detec-
tion, the deposition of thin ﬁlms like amorphous-Si on CMOS ASICs and the
use of a CMOS-SOI process on a wafer with high resistivity bulk material.
A semi-monolithic approach are the DEPFET pixels which integrate active

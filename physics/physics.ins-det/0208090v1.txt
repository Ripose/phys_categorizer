We have investigated the radiation damage eﬀects on a CCD to be employed in the

Japanese X-ray astronomy mission including the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI)

onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Since low energy protons release their

energy mainly at the charge transfer channel, resulting a decrease of the charge transfer

eﬃciency, we thus focused on the low energy protons in our experiments. A 171 keV to

3.91 MeV proton beam was irradiated to a given device. We measured the degradation

of the charge transfer ineﬃciency (CTI) as a function of incremental ﬂuence. A 292 keV

proton beam degraded the CTI most seriously. Taking into account the proton energy

dependence of the CTI, we conﬁrmed that the transfer channel has the lowest radiation

tolerance. We have also developed the diﬀerent device architectures to reduce the ra-

diation damage in orbit. Among them, the “notch” CCD, in which the buried channel

implant concentration is increased, resulting in a deeper potential well than outside, has

three times higher radiation tolerance than that of the normal CCD. We then estimated

the charge transfer ineﬃciency of the CCD in the orbit of ISS, considering the proton

1

energy spectrum. The CTI value is estimated to be 1.1 × 10−5 per each transfer after two

years of mission life in the worse case analysis if the highest radiation-tolerant device is

employed. This value is well within the acceptable limit and we have conﬁrmed the high

radiation-tolerance of CCDs for the MAXI mission.

1. Introduction

Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have emerged as the preferred detectors on all new

X-ray astronomy mission in recent years. This is because they possess a high spatial

resolution as well as a moderate energy resolution, simultaneously.1) The dead layer above

CCD must be thin enough to attain a high quantum eﬃciency at soft X-ray regions. As

the result, devices cannot be protected against the high energy particles in space in the

incident direction of X-rays.

Soon after the launch of the X-ray astronomy satellite, Chandra, all of the front-

illuminated CCD of the X-ray CCD camera (ACIS) have suﬀered some damage caused

by the charge transfer ineﬃciency (CTI).2) The CTI is deﬁned as an average fraction

of charge packet lost at each transfer. Similar type of devices to ACIS CCDs have been

tested by the high energy protons (40 MeV and 10 MeV) but not by the low energy pro-

tons before launch. The low energy protons having energy of ∼ 150 keV release major

part of its energy at the transfer channel of the ACIS CCDs, which is located roughly

1 µm below the electrodes. They cause the displacement damages in Si, leading to the

formation of trapping sites for the charge packet. Since the ﬂux of low energy protons at

the orbit of Chandra is much higher than that at the low earth orbit such as ASCA3) and

low energy protons reﬂecting through the X-ray mirror assembly (HRMA) can reach the

focal plane,4) a signiﬁcant degradation of the CTI has occurred.

The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) has been selected as an early payload of

the JEM (Japanese Experimental Module; KIBO) Exposed Facility on the International

Space Station (ISS).5) MAXI has slit scanning cameras which consist of two kinds of X-

ray detectors; one-dimensional position sensitive proportional counters with total area of

∼ 5000 cm2 named GSC and the X-ray CCD camera with total area of ∼ 200 cm2 named

SSC. SSC carries 32 CCDs which are three-side buttable with full-frame transfer and have

1024×1024 pixels of 24 µm × 24 µm size with two phase gate structures. The CCD chips

are fabricated by the Hamamatsu Photonics K. K. (HPK). In order to perform useful

X-ray spectroscopy over the whole device, the CTI must be less than roughly 2 × 10−5

per transfer where the shift of the peak energy is similar to that of the Fano-limited noise

3

of 120 eV at 5.9 keV.

Previous studies of the radiation hardness for HPK CCDs were also focused on high

energy protons above 1 MeV6) and no data are available for low energy protons. We thus

performed the irradiation test focusing on the low energy protons.

In this paper, we

describe the device architecture, irradiation experiment, and the measurement of the CTI

at −100 ◦C.

2. Experiments and Results

2.1 Architecture of CCD

We employed CCDs packaged in a half-inch size which is diﬀerent from that of the MAXI

CCD whereas the device was fabricated from the same type of wafer of the MAXI CCD.

The devices irradiated possess 512×512 pixels of which size is 24 µm square. Figure 1(a)

shows the schematic view of the CCD. The cross section of a CCD pixel in the horizontal

and the vertical direction is shown in Fig 1(b) (we call this type of device as normal

CCD which has no countermeasure for radiation hardness). Since the CCD employed

is a buried-channel type, there is a thin (≃ 1 µm) doped n-type layer just below the

oxide layer. There are four electrodes per pixel in our case and they slightly overlap each

other as shown in the cross section of Fig 1(b) (right). There is another gate structure,

a “channel stop”, which forms the pixel boundary along the vertical transfer direction

shown in Fig 1(b) (left).

We need to develop a highly radiation-tolerant device to be employed in space for a long

time. One of the design to improve the radiation tolerance is a “notch” structure.7) The

notch CCD incorporated a narrow, ∼ 3 µm, strip both for vertical and horizontal registers

in which the buried channel implant concentration was increased, resulting in a deeper

potential well than outside the notch structure as shown in bottom of Fig 1(c). Small

charge packet would be conﬁned within the notch structure to reduce the probability to

encounter with vacant traps by a factor of ∼8. We therefore expect that the CTI would

be improved in the device having the notch structure as CRAF/Cassini CCDs7) and EEV

CCDs.8) We should note that all devices used in section 2.3 and 2.4 possesses the notch

structure.

4

Another technique employed is to replace some amount of the Si oxide with the nitride

oxide as shown in Fig 1(d) (nitride CCD, hereafter). The thickness of the oxide layer

and the nitride layer of the nitride CCD we fabricated is similar to that of the oxide

layer of the normal device. There is no diﬀerences below and above the nitride and oxide

layer between the nitride CCD and the normal CCD. The nitridation of the oxide layer

enables us to reduce the ionization damage, resulting the eﬀect of the ﬂat-band shift to

be smaller than those of devices having only oxides.9, 10) This technique would reduce the

dark current for damaged devices. It might not be eﬃcient to improve the CTI since the

nitride CCD possesses the similar structure of the depletion layer to the normal CCD.

However, the degradation of the CTI must be similar level for normal devices.

We have developed CCDs from various Si wafers. Details about newly-developed devices

have been described in Miyata et al.11) Devices fabricating from epitaxial wafer and from

bulk wafer were tested. We have decided to employ devices from epitaxial wafer in order

to achieve the high energy resolution, high quantum eﬃciency for hard X-rays, and also

low dark current. Among them, we employed the epitaxial-2 (hereafter referred as epi-2)

and epitaxial-3 (referred as epi-3) devices for comparison. The resistivity of epi-3 wafer

is roughly an order of magnitude higher than that of epi-2 wafer.

We then fabricated following four types devices to compare their radiation tolerance;

epi-3 with and without notch, epi-2 with notch, and epi-2 without notch but having the

nitride oxide.

2.2 Experimental setup and beam calibration

A 570 keV to 4.0 MeV proton beam, shown in Table I, was provided by the Van de Graaﬀ

accelerator at the Laboratory for Nuclear Studies, Osaka University. We employed an Al

degrader with a thickness of 5 µm to reduce the energy down to 171 keV (Table I). Pulsed

beams were used to control the irradiation ﬂuence. The proton beam was over-defocussed

by quadrupole magnet to obtain a weak and uniform beam at the CCD.

Figure 2 shows the experimental setup of the CCD chamber. We employed four di-

aphragm plates made of Al between the degrader and the CCD in order to reduce scat-

tered protons or secondary electrons generated by the inside wall of the duct.

Inside

5

the CCD chamber, the collimator made of Al with a thickness of 3 mm having a hole of

21 mm φ was set both to collimate the proton beam and to monitor the intensity of the

incident proton beam to the CCD. Two 55Fe sources were located behind the collimator.

It enabled us to investigate the in-situ performance of the CCD.

Roughly a half area of each CCD was shielded against protons to provide the non-

irradiated data to compare with those from the irradiated region. Since the amount of

scattering of protons is not small, the vertical boundary between the shielded and the

irradiated region was not so clear. It makes the calculation of the CTI in the horizontal

transfer direction to be much uncertain. We thus focused on the vertical CTI only.

We drove CCDs with our newly-developed system, E-NA system.12) The CCD analog

data were processed by an integration-type circuit11) and digital data were acquired with

a VME system. The readout noise of our system including the device is less than 10 e−

rms under the charge transfer rate of 125 kHz.

We calibrated the beam current with replacing the CCD by a Faraday cup made of Al

shown in Fig 2. We measured the current at the Faraday cup and the collimator with

pico-ammeter, simultaneously. We thus obtained the ratio of each current at given energy.

We found that the ratio depended on the beam energy possibly because the probability

of secondary emission depends on the beam energy when protons hit materials inside the

chamber. The accuracy of the beam intensity estimated from the collimator current could

be achieved to be 5 % taking into account their energy dependence.

The spatial uniformity of the beam intensity was measured with 650 keV protons. The

proton energy at downstream of the degrader was 292 keV (detail will be described in

the next section). A 292 keV proton generate electron-hole pair along its track inside

the CCD. Electrons generated only at the depletion layer can be collected. After passing

through the covering layer, electrode, and the oxide layer shown in Fig 1(b), the proton

energy was reduced to be ∼ 6 keV which generate charge cloud consisting of ∼ 1.6 × 103

electrons, which is much lower than the capacity of a pixel. We, therefore, irradiated

very week 650 keV proton beam onto the CCD so that pile-up eﬀect is negligibly small.

Protons detected by CCDs formed various types of events similar to X-rays: single-pixel

event, two-pixel split event, and more extended event. We thus measured the number

6

of events generated by protons in 24 mm squares and found the spatial uniformity to be

better than 10 %.

2.3 Performance degradation of mono-energetic protons

We performed the incremental irradiations at given energy on a given device. All

devices were in operation (biased) during this experiment and fabricated from the same

wafer (epitaxial-3 wafer). Table I shows the energy of proton irradiated. The center

energy and width of proton spectrum at downstream of the degrader were calculated

with the Geant4.13) We employed the low energy extension with G4EMLOW0.3 data in

Geant4 in order to simulate the physical process of low energy less than 2 MeV.14)

In

the subsequent section, we only referred the proton energy to that at downstream of the

degrader.

Figure 3 (a) shows the spectrum of 55Fe extracted from single-pixel events before proton

irradiation. The energy resolution of Mn Kα has a full-width at a half maximum (FWHM)

of 146 eV. After an irradiation of 292 keV proton with a ﬂuence of 1.04 × 107 cm−2, the

degradation of the detector performance was signiﬁcant and the energy resolution became

294 eV (Fig 3 (b)). The peak positions of Mn Kα and Kβ were shifted, suggesting the

incomplete collection of the charge packet. We then incremented ﬂuence up to 1.11 ×

108 cm−2 and resultant spectrum is shown in Fig 3 (c). Mn Kα and Kβ X-rays could not

be resolved and the energy resolution was degraded to 614 eV. The device irradiated with

292 keV protons suﬀered the most serious damage on the energy resolution compared with

those irradiated by protons of other energies.

Figure 4 shows the readout noise as a function of proton ﬂuence for 292 keV and

3.91 MeV protons. Since the readout noise was evaluated from the histogram of the

horizontal over-clocked area, it included the noise of CCD as well as that of the elec-

tronics. Before the proton irradiation, the readout noise of both CCDs were ∼ 7.8 e−.

Therefore, there was not an inﬂuence of proton irradiations on the readout noise. In this

way, we conﬁrmed no degradation of the readout noise for irradiations with protons of any

energies employed. The degradation of energy resolution shown in Fig 3 was not caused

by the degradation of the readout noise.

7

Figure 5 shows the pulse heights of 55Fe events as a function of the number of transfer.

Each dot in these ﬁgures corresponds to an individual X-ray event. The histogram shown

in Fig 3 can be obtained if one makes a projection of these plots to Y-axis (pulse height

axis). Before irradiation, there are two horizontal lines clearly seen, corresponding to Mn

Kα at ∼ 710 channel and Kβ at ∼ 790 channel (Fig 5 (a)). After irradiating with 292 keV

protons with ﬂuence of 1.04 × 107 cm−2, the pulse height of X-ray events decreases with

increasing transfer number, suggesting the loss of the charge packet during the transfer

(Fig 5 (b)). We should note that the widths of two lines were broadened as the transfer

number became larger. Figure 5 (c) shows the same plot after irradiating with protons

of 1.11 × 108 cm−2. The signiﬁcant loss of charge packet is found and the pulse height at

the transfer number of 500 is less than half of that before irradiation. The pulse height

at the transfer number of zero is still less than that before irradiation, suggesting the loss

of charge packet in the serial register of the device.

In order to characterize the loss of charge packet, we calculated the values of the CTI for

all proton energies based on Fig 5. Figure 6 shows the CTI as a function of proton ﬂuence

for various proton energies. Protons having energy of 150 keV have seriously degraded the

detector performance in the case of ACIS. On the other hand, 171 keV protons aﬀected

the CTI for HPK CCDs less eﬀectively. Instead, HPK CCDs suﬀered serious damage by

protons with higher energies of 292 and 391 keV. The degradation of the CTI caused by

proton energies above 500 keV is again less than those of protons of 292 and 391 keV.

Since values of the CTI shown in Fig 6 depend on the initial value of the CTI, we

calculated the increase rate of the CTI (∆CTI) as a function of proton ﬂuence at each

incremental irradiation for various energies, shown in Fig 7.

2.4 Dependence of CTI on biased and unbiased devices

On the satellite orbit including the ISS, high energy particles distribute far from uniform

but concentrate in a very small area on the Earth. The most dense region of the high

energy particles is so-called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). During the passage of

the SAA, the quality of data would be bad because of high background. Therefore, if the

performance degradation of CCDs depends on the biased (in operation) or unbiased (out

8

of operation) condition, we could turn oﬀ CCDs during the passage of the SAA.

We thus investigated the diﬀerence of device performance whether the device was biased

or not during irradiation of 292 keV protons. Figure 8 shows the ∆CTI as a function of

proton ﬂuence. We found no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between them. Therefore, the devices

need not to be turned oﬀ during SAA only taking into account the degradation of CTI.

2.5 CTI for various devices and for various processes

As written in section 2.1, we fabricated four types devices to compare the diﬀerence of

radiation hardness. All devices were unbiased during the proton irradiation. The values of

∆CTI obtained for these devices are shown in Fig 9. We found that ∆CTI value obtained

by epi-3 with notch is factor of 3 − 5 times lower than that with epi-3 without notch.

Signiﬁcant improvement is obtained although this value is slightly smaller than that of

the geometrical ratio of notched area and other area. We thus decided to employ the

notch structure for ﬂight devices.

There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between epi-2 with notch and epi-3 with notch, sug-

gesting no diﬀerences in ∆CTI for high and low resistivity wafers. We can therefore

investigate the eﬀect of the nitride oxide comparing between epi-3 without notch and epi-

2 without notch but having the nitride oxide. There were very little diﬀerences between.

Therefore, if the degradation of the dark current in the device having the nitride oxide

is smaller than that without the nitride oxide, we will employ the nitride oxide for ﬂight

devices. The experimental results concerning about the dark current is described in the

subsequent paper.

3. Discussion

3.1 Proton Bragg curve

We found that protons having energies of 292 and 391 keV seriously damaged HPK

CCDs on the CTI performance. The degradation of the CTI obtained with protons having

lower and higher energies is much less than those with 292 and 391 keV protons. This

strongly suggests that the low radiation-tolerant region inside the HPK CCD is located

in relatively a narrow region.

We calculated the Bragg curves of protons in Si. We employed Geant4 with the

9

G4EMLOW0.3 data and considered the energy straggling due to the Al degrader of 5 µm

in thickness. Figure 10 (upper) shows the energy loss of protons as a function of depth of

Si. The dotted line represents the minimum energy to displace Si atoms (≃ 6 eV ˚A−1).15)

The energy deposition due to 292 and 391 keV protons are concentrated at the depth of

2 − 4 µm inside Si. In this depth, the energy deposition of protons with other energies is

less than those of 292 and 391 keV. Therefore, the radiation tolerance at depth of 2 −4 µm

is much lower than those in other region inside the HPK CCD.

Figure 10 (lower) shows the schematic view of the cross section of the HPK CCD

employed. Since the HPK CCD is a buried-channel type, the charge packet is transferred

in a narrow region along the depth of the CCD. This transfer channel well coincides

with the Bragg peak region. We thus conclude that the transfer channel of the CCD

possesses the lowest radiation tolerance for protons. This result is consistent with the

ACIS result but the serious proton energy is slightly diﬀerent from our value. Prigozhin

et al.2) estimated the minimum proton energy to reach the buried channel to be somewhat

higher than 50−70 keV in order to penetrate the optical blocking ﬁlter, covering layer,

and electrodes. Therefore, the thickness of the covering material is much thinner than

our case, resulting that lower energy protons seriously aﬀected the ACIS CCDs.

As described in section 2.5, there is no diﬀerence in CTI values between CCDs fabricat-

ing from high resistivity wafer and those from low resistivity wafer. The acceptor doping

concentration of our device is only an order of 1013 − 1014 cm−3 and the diﬀerence between

epi-2 wafer and epi-3 wafer is roughly an order of magnitude.11) Therefore, the probability

that protons encounter Si atom is essentially the same between these devices. Since the

thickness of n-type layer is the same between them, their diﬀerence is the thickness of a

depletion layer. It means that the location of the transfer channel is at the same depth

between them. Our results are, therefore, expected if the radiation tolerance depends not

on the depletion depth but on the transfer channel. This is consistent with the previous

work.8) We are now developing CCDs from newly-obtained epitaxial wafer having much

higher resistivity than that of epi-3. Since, however, the location of the transfer channel

of new CCDs is the same depth as current devices, we are convinced that we can apply

these results to new CCDs.

10

3.2 Modeling the CTI degradation

As shown in Fig 7, the degradations of ∆CTI are expressed as a linear function of

the proton ﬂuence. Since ∆CTI is expressed as a linear function of the electron trap

density,16) the formation of electron traps proportionally corresponds to proton ﬂuence.

Values of ∆CTI are ﬁtted to a linear function of proton ﬂuence. The best ﬁt parameters,

a slope and an intercept (∆CTI0), are shown in Table II. Figure 11 shows the slope

obtained as a function of proton energy. Since the obtained values of slope correspond to

an eﬃciency to create the electron trap, Fig 11 shows that 292 keV protons most seriously

aﬀect the CTI degradation.

As shown in Fig 10, low energy protons deposit major part of their energy within a

conﬁned depth. The peak of the Bragg curve corresponds to the depth of 2.3 µm in Si in

the case of 292 keV protons. We thus assume there is a thin radiation-sensitive area within

the CCD at depth of 2.3 µm with thickness of 0.05 µm. We should note that 0.05 µm is

the shortest unit we can simulate. Ignoring the ∆CTI degradation from other depths, we

can calculate the energy deposition by protons that aﬀect the CTI. Results are plotted in

Fig 11 with ﬁlled circles normalized by value at 292 keV. For all proton energies, calculated

values are much larger than those obtained. As shown in Fig 10, if the thickness of the

radiation-sensitive region increases, the energy deposit of 391 or 522 keV protons becomes

relatively larger than that of 292 keV protons. It drove the calculated values for 391 and

522 keV to be increased much more than current values, resulting the deviation from data

to be more signiﬁcant. In this calculation, we assumed that the probability to create an

electron trap is linearly proportional to the proton energy loss. This assumption leads

to a large discrepancies between the data and the calculations. Therefore, there may be

some nonlinear eﬀects in their probabilities.

There are two types of process for proton energy loss: an ionization energy loss (IEL)

and a nonionization energy loss (NIEL). These two diﬀerent forms of energy dissipation

are translated into two major damage mechanisms for CCDs: an ionization damage and a

bulk damage. The ionization damage leads to a ﬂat-band shift which causes the operating

voltage to be shifted. This damage is caused by all types of charged particles. On the

other hand, energetic charged particles undergo Rutherford-scattering-type Coulombic

11

interactions with the Si lattice structure. The energy deposited by the interacting ion is

enough to pull a silicon atom out of its lattice position, forming an interstitial Si atom

and a vacancy. The displaced atom, called the primary knock-on atom (PKA), may have

suﬃcient energy to undergo collisions with lattice, producing more vacancies. NIEL is

responsible for a part of the energy producing the initial vacancy-interstitial pairs and

phonons.

Ziegler et al.17) and Burke18) calculated the IEL and the NIEL, respectively. Based on

their calculations, more than 98 % of incident proton energies (Ep [keV]) release as the

IEL for Ep ≥ 100 keV. For a proton of relativistic energies, the NIEL is almost constant

whereas with lower energies the NIEL has a 1/Ep dependence. This suggests that the

probability to create displacements is not linearly proportional to the total energy loss but

is proportional to E−γ

p . We then ﬁtted the function E−γ

p

to the results of NIEL calculated

by Burke. We found that γ can be approximated to be ≃ 0.76 at the energy range of

100 keV ≤ Ep ≤ 4 MeV.

In order to take into account the nonlinear eﬀect in creating traps due to the NIEL,

we need to employ not the incident proton energy but the energy at the depth of 2.3 µm.

We calculated the energy reduction of Ep during the passage of 2.3 µm in Si with Geant4.

We then calculated the fraction of the NIEL among the total energy loss with taking

into account of the energy dependence of the NIEL for each reduced Ep. We normalized

the fraction of the NIEL for each proton energy by that of 292 keV and took them into

account for the previous calculations. Results are shown by ﬁlled squares in Fig 11.

Our calculations considering the NIEL represent the data obtained. However, values of

slope measured suddenly decreases as Ep increases whereas they cannot be reproduced

by our calculations. In our model, we only consider the NIEL which represent the energy

deposition as the initial vacancy-interstitial pairs and phonons.

If the energy of PKA

is large enough to undergo collisions with Si atoms, the number of vacancies increase.

Therefore, to take into account the spectrum of PKA and collisions between PKA and Si

atoms is important for future modeling.

Empirical relations between the slope of the ∆CTI versus the proton energy are de-

scribed as:

12

slope(Ep [keV]) = 1.2 × 10−10 × Ep − 2.0 × 10−11

for Ep ≤ 292 keV

(3.1)

slope(Ep [keV]) = 1.2 × 10−9 × exp(−Ep/6.6 × 10−2) + 3.0 × 10−13

for Ep ≥ 292 keV(3.2)

Solid lines in Fig 11 represent above empirical relations. For a given proton spectrum

in orbit, we can calculate the ∆CTI value by summing contributions from all proton

energies.

3.3 Estimate the CTI for the MAXI mission

We found that low energy protons with energies of 290 − 400 keV seriously damaged

the spectroscopic performance of the MAXI CCDs. The degradation of CTI as a function

of mission life for the MAXI based on our experiments has been estimated. There is a

slit at the top of the SSC camera with a size of 5×0.3 mm2 and the slat collimators just

above the CCDs.19) The thickness of the slat collimator is ∼ 100 µm, which is aligned by

∼ 3 mm pitch, resulting the ﬁeld of view of each CCD to be ∼ 1.5 ◦ square. Within the

ﬁeld of view, no shield protects devices whereas the column density at other directions on

the camera is ∼ 2.5 g cm−2, suggesting the proton component passing through the camera

to be negligibly small. We thus calculate the proton ﬂux coming through 1.5 ◦ ×1.5 ◦ area.

We employed the proton ﬂux described in the literature,20) in which the attitude of

the ISS is 500 km and solar activity is the maximum. The proton ﬂux at 500 km is the

largest among attitudes expected for the ISS20) and we therefore use it for the worst case

analysis. The number of proton at the solar minimum is factor of ∼ 2 larger than that at

the solar maximum. We thus increase the proton ﬂux with a factor of 1.5 as the average

value. Figure 12 shows the CTI estimated for the MAXI as a function of its mission life.

The dotted line shows the acceptable limit for the MAXI mission. Since the mission life

of the MAXI is two years, the degradation of the CTI is well below the acceptable limit

even for the worst case analysis. We therefore conﬁrm the high radiation torelance of

MAXI CCDs.

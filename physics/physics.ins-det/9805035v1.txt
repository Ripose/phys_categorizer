Abstract

The general purpose spherical nonmagnetic detector ( SND ) is now taking data at
VEPP-2M e+e− collider in BINP ( Novosibirsk ) in the centre of mass energy range
of 0.2
1.4 GeV. The energy calibration of the NaI(Tl) calorimeter of the SND
detector with cosmic muons is described. Using this method, the energy resolution
of 5.5 % (σ) for 500 MeV photons was achieved.

1 Introduction

Electromagnetic scintillation calorimeters are an important part of many el-
ementary particle detectors. One of the most complicated problems of such
calorimeters is the energy calibration, i.e. determination of coeﬃcients, needed
for conversion of electrical signals from the calorimeter into corresponding en-
ergy depositions, measured in units of MeV. Commonly used for that purpose
are particles, producing known energy depositions in the calorimeter counters,
e.g. gamma quanta from radioactive sources, cosmic muons, or particle beams.

Cosmic radiation is a continuos and freely available source of charged particles.
At the sea level the main part of them is represented by muons (
75%),
1GeV) to traverse the whole detector. In the
having high enough energies (
calorimeter counters muons loose energy due to ionization of the medium. The
average ionization losses are close to 5 MeV/cm in NaI(Tl). With reasonable
accuracy one can also assume, that the trajectory of the muon is a straight
line and that energy is left mainly in the counters crossed by this line.

Cosmic calibration of the SND calorimeter is a preliminary stage before the
ﬁnal calibration. Its goal is to obtain approximate values of the constants
for the calculation of energy depositions. These constants are needed to level
responses of all crystals in order to obtain equal ﬁrst level trigger energy
threshold over the whole calorimeter. They are also used as seed values for a
precise OFF-LINE calibration procedure, based on analysis of Bhabha events.
The requirements for the cosmic calibration procedure are the following: the
calibration procedure must take not more than 12 hours, it must be indepen-
dent of the other detector systems, and statistical errors in the conversion
coeﬃcients must be less than 1%.

The scheme of this procedure was brieﬂy described in [1]. Its important feature
is that it makes use of virtually all muons detected in the calorimeter, greatly
reducing the time required for calibration. In many other implementations of
cosmic calibration, e.g. in the L3 detector at LEP [2], muons, traversing the
detector only in certain directions, were selected.

2 The SND calorimeter

The SND detector [3,4] (Fig. 1) consists of two cylindrical drift chambers for
charge particle tracking, calorimeter, and a muon system.

The main part of the detector is a three-layer spherical calorimeter, based on
NaI(Tl) crystals. The pairs of counters of the two inner layers, with thickness of
2.9 and 4.8 X0 respectively, where X0 = 2.6 cm is a radiation length, are sealed
in thin aluminum containers, ﬁxed to an aluminum supporting hemisphere.
Behind it, the third layer of NaI(Tl) crystals, 5.7 X0 thick, is placed (Fig. 2).
The total thickness of the calorimeter for particles, originating from the center
of the detector, is equal to 34.7 cm (13.4 X0). The total number of counters
is 1632, the number of crystals per layer varies from 520 to 560. The angular
dimensions of the most of crystals are ∆φ = ∆θ = 9◦, the total solid angle is
90% of 4π.

The electronics channel (Fig. 3) consists of:

(1) phototriode with an average quantum eﬃciency of the photocathode for
the NaI(Tl) emission spectrum of about 15% and gain of about 10 [5]. The
light collection eﬃciency varies from 7 to 15 % for diﬀerent calorimeter
layers,

(2) charge sensitive preampliﬁer (CSA) with a conversion coeﬃcient of 0.7 V/pC,
(3) 12-channel shaping ampliﬁer (SHA) with a remote controlled gain that
can be set to any value in the range from 0 to a maximum with a reso-
lution of 1/255.

2

(4) 24-channel 12 bit analog to digital converter (ADC) with a maximum

input signal Umax = 2V,

(5) in addition the SHA produces special signals for the ﬁrst level trigger, the
most important of which is the analog sum of all calorimeter channels —
the total energy deposition.

Each calorimeter channel can be tested using a precision computer controlled
calibration generator. The amplitude of its signal can be set to any value
from 0 to 1 V with a resolution of 1/4096. The equivalent electronics noise of
individual calorimeter counters lies within a range of 150-350 keV.

3 Algorithm of the detector calibration with cosmic muons

The calibration procedure is based on the comparison of experimental energy
depositions in the calorimeter crystals for cosmic muons with Monte Carlo
simulation. The simulation was carried out by means of the UNIMOD2 [6]
code, developed for simulation of e+e− colliding beam experiments. Simulated
were muons crossing the sphere with a radius of 80 cm, centered at the beam
crossing point, and containing all calorimeter crystals. The cosmic muon gen-
eration program is based on data from [7]. Experimental data on the energy
and angular spectra of cosmic muons were approximated using the following

The passage of particles through the detector was simulated by means of
the UNIMOD2 code. As a result the energy depositions in the calorimeter
crystals were calculated in each event. A total of 1 000 000 cosmic events were
simulated.

The simulated events were processed as follows. The track of cosmic muon
was ﬁtted to the hit crystals and expected track lengths in each crystal were

3

E(MeV)

calculated. Energy depositions Ei and track lengths li were summed over event
sample for each crystal separately and for each crystal their ratio was calcu-
lated: Cmc(MeV/cm) =
. Brackets denote averaging over
event samples. Then the calorimeter channels were calibrated electronically,
using the generator. In order to account for the electronics nonlinearity, the
calibration data were taken at two signiﬁcantly diﬀerent values of SHA gain
and wide range of calibration generator amplitudes, covering the whole dy-
namic range of the ADCs. In addition, data were taken at a working value of
the SHA gain.

Using all these data and assuming that the dependence of the ADC counts Sadc
on the generator amplitude Ugen is described by a second order polynomial,
and that the generator amplitude itself linearly depends on generator code,
one can obtain a, b, c, p, Ku constants, deﬁned by the following expressions:

Sadc = aU 2

gen + bUgen + c and Ugen = Ku(G + p),

(3)

where G and p are a generator code and pedestal respectively, Ku - the relative
SHA gain. The next step is to obtain from these intermediate results the ﬁnal
constants A, B, and C for the working values of SHA gain, from the knowledge
of which one can calculate the equivalent generator code G for any measured
ADC count:

G = AS2

adc + BSadc + C.

(4)

It relates an ADC count to a corresponding generator code, which allows the
linearization of the ADC response.

The next stage is processing of the experimental events. About 1.5 million
events (Fig. 4) are needed to be collected in special data taking runs with total
duration of 4.5 hours. The processing itself is the same as that of the simulated
events, but now the initial ADC counts are ﬁrst transformed into equivalent
generator codes. As a result, values of Cexp(Gen/cm) =
for
each crystal are obtained. The meaning of Cexp is a code, which should be
written into the generator to produce signals on CSA input, equivalent to an
average input signal produced by a 1 cm long muon track.

Using Cexp(Gen/cm) and Cmc(MeV/cm), for each crystal we can calculate

Ccal(MeV/Gen) = Cmc(MeV/cm)/Cexp(Gen/cm) —

(5)

an equivalent generator code, corresponding to an energy deposition of 1 MeV
in a crystal. Then the gains of the SHA channels are adjusted to equalize
contributions of diﬀerent crystals into the total energy deposition signal and

4

the ﬁnal generator calibration pass is carried out. It yields the coeﬃcients
ak, bk, and ck, needed to transform Sadc into MeV according to the following
formula:

E(Mev) = akS2

adc + bkSadc + ck.

(6)

The use of the precision generator as a reference calibration source is very
convenient not only because its linearity is much higher than that of the
ADC, but it also simpliﬁes the replacement of any element of the electronics
channel, except the CPA or generator itself. All what is needed after that is
to recalibrate the calorimeter with the generator.

4 The description of the event processing algorithm

The goal of the experimental and simulated events processing is to obtain the
normalized ratios Cmc(MeV/cm) and Cexp(Gen/cm). The need for normaliza-
tion of the energy deposition to the unit track length in a crystal arises from
the fact that the raw energy deposition spectra in crystals are very wide and
have very weakly pronounced maxima. On the other hand, such a normal-
ization reduces systematic errors due to possible diﬀerences in the angular
distributions of simulated and real muons, and diﬀerences in the directions
of crystals axes over the calorimeter. The simulated and experimental events
are processed using the same computer code. The only diﬀerence is that be-
fore processing of a simulated event it is checked for passing the experimental
trigger. The following selection criteria are used for event selection: the total
number of hit crystals must be from 5 to 25. Crystals with energy depositions
smaller than the threshold value (currently 5 MeV) are discarded. Similarly
discarded are crystals with ADC counts less than 20. An event is selected if
more than four hit crystals survive these cuts. For those crystals a straight
line is ﬁtted, using a least squares method, i. e. the sum of squares of distances
from the crystal centers to the line is minimized. The line is parametrized as:

~r = ~R + ~vt,

where ~R is an arbitrary point on the line, ~v is a unitary vector in the direction
of the line, t — parameter. Then, the squared distance from the center of i-th
crystal to the line is:

As seed value the unitary vector in the direction of the line between the centers
of the two most distant crystals in the event is used. On each iteration step the
presence of hit crystals at distances greater than 2σi from the line is checked.
If such crystals exist, two options are considered. The ﬁrst one is to remove the
most distant crystal from the list, the second one is to remove the crystal, most
distant from the point ~R0. For both cases the ﬁtting of the line is repeated
and the ﬁnal choice is based on the minimal value of Fmin( ~R0, ~v). If there are
more than one crystal to be discarded then the event is rejected completely.
From the remaining events only those are selected where Fmin( ~R0, ~v) divided
by the number of hit crystals is less than 0.7 (Fig. 6).

After that, the expected lengths of the muon track lij in each crystal are
calculated and averaged over the whole event sample together with the energy
depositions Eij. The values of average track lengths

The distributions of experimental events over number of hit crystals with
energy depositions higher than threshold value and over Fmin( ~R0, ~v) are in
good agreement with the simulated ones (Fig. 5, 6). Small diﬀerences between
experimental and simulated distributions may be attributed to inaccuracies in
the angular and energy spectra of the primary particles and ﬁrst level trigger
simulation. This also may cause small diﬀerences in the distributions over the
angle relative to vertical direction (Fig. 7). Shown in Fig. 8 are distributions
over total energy deposition in the detector, normalized to a unitary track
length also agree well.

A comparison of average track lengths of muons in the calorimeter crystals for
the experimental and simulated events was carried out. The results are listed
in Table 2. The statistical uncertainty of the Cexp coeﬃcients is less than 1 %
for all three layers of the calorimeter. At the same time the uncertainties of the
corresponding coeﬃcients for simulated events are determined by simulation
statistics.

where E is a particle energy, Em — the position of maximum, A — normaliza-

bution at half maximum divided by 2.36. A, Em, σ, and tx were treated as free
parameters during ﬁtting. Energy resolution was deﬁned as σE/E = σ/Em.

Experimental and Monte Carlo resolutions of the calorimeter at 500 MeV are
respectively 3.7 % and 5.5 % for photons and 3.5 % and 5.2 % for electrons.
Peak and mean values of the experimental and simulated distributions agree
to a level of about 1 %, but the widths of experimental distributions are signif-
icantly larger. The possible explanation of the broadening of the experimental
spectra could be electronics instability, systematic errors in calibration proce-
dure and nonuniformity of light collection eﬃciency over the crystal volume.

Study of the electronics and photodetector stability showed, that it can at-
tribute to a maximum of 1 % shifts for the time duration of the collection of
energy deposition spectra. Systematic biases were estimated by comparison
of the calibration coeﬃcients with those obtained using a special procedure
based on minimization of the width of the energy deposition spectrum in the
calorimeter for e+e− events. Such a calibration was carried out using experi-
mental statistics collected in 1996 [8]. The average bias of coeﬃcients relatively
to those obtained with cosmic calibration was 3 % for the ﬁrst layer. No sta-
tistically signiﬁcant bias was found in other two layers. The RMS diﬀerence
in calibration coeﬃcients, obtained using cosmic and e+e− calibration proce-
5 %. The resulting energy resolution after e+e− calibration
dures is close to 3
was close to 5.0 % for photons and 4.6 % for electrons, which is still worse
than that expected from Monte Carlo simulation.

A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out taking into account a nonuniformity
of light collection eﬃciency over the crystal volume. The results are shown in

Fig. 10 together with the experimental distribution. The energy resolution for
simulated events decreased to 4.1 %. It shows that the broadening of experi-
mental spectra was mainly determined by the nonuniformity of light collection
eﬃciency over the crystal volume.

The cosmic calibration procedure was used during a ﬁve month experiment
with SND at VEPP-2M in 1996 [8]. Relative shifts in calibration coeﬃcients
are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen, that for a one week period between
consecutive calibrations, the mean shift of the coeﬃcients is less than 2 % and
2 %.
RMS of their random spread is 1

÷

With the help of the described procedure of SND calorimeter calibration a
statistical accuracy of 1 % in calibration coeﬃcients and energy resolution
of 5.5 % for 500 MeV electromagnetic showers was achieved. Mean energy
depositions agree with simulation at a level better than 1 %. The total time,
required for calorimeter calibration is not more than 5 hours.

Abstract

An 800 ℓ liquid xenon scintillation γ ray detector is being developed for the MEG
experiment which will search for µ+ → e+γ decay at the Paul Scherrer Institut.
Absorption of scintillation light of xenon by impurities might possibly limit the
performance of such a detector. We used a 100 ℓ prototype with an active volume of
372×372×496 mm3 to study the scintillation light absorption. We have developed a
method to evaluate the light absorption, separately from elastic scattering of light,
by measuring cosmic rays and α sources. By using a suitable puriﬁcation technique,
an absorption length longer than 100 cm has been achieved. The eﬀects of the light
absorption on the energy resolution are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation.

1 Introduction

A liquid xenon (LXe) scintillation γ ray detector is being developed for the
MEG experiment which will search for µ+ → e+γ decay at the Paul Scherrer
Institut [1]. The MEG experiment aims to improve the sensitivity by at least
two orders of magnitude over the previous experiment [2] and to reach a µ+ →
e+γ branching ratio that is predicted by theories of supersymmetric grand
uniﬁcation [3] and supersymmetric theories with right-handed neutrinos [4].

The LXe detector is an indispensable component of the experiment that en-
ables to achieve such a superior sensitivity with its excellent performance in
γ ray measurement. It will have an active LXe volume of 800 ℓ surrounded
by 800 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) viewing inside [1]. The detector utilizes
only scintillation light without any attempt to measure ionization. The prin-
ciple of the detector has been successfully demonstrated by a small prototype
with an active LXe volume of 2.34 ℓ surrounded by 32 PMTs [5].

However, since such a large LXe detector has never been built, nobody has
veriﬁed long distance transparency of LXe for the vacuum ultra violet (VUV)
scintillation light of xenon. While LXe itself should never absorb the scintil-
lation, practically unavoidable impurities might deteriorate the transparency
and thus the performance of the detector.

We have recently built a 100 ℓ prototype with an active volume of 372 × 372 ×
496 mm3 (69 ℓ) surrounded by 228 PMTs to gain practical experiences in
operating such a device and to prove its excellent performance. In this paper
we describe how this prototype has been used to evaluate the absorption of the
scintillation light in LXe. Based on the obtained result, the eﬀects of the light
absorption on the energy resolution are estimated by Monte Carlo simulation.

2 Optical properties of LXe

We discuss here the optical properties of LXe that are of interest for a scintil-
lation detector. The main optical properties of LXe are listed in Table 1.

Light attenuation in LXe can be described by the attenuation length, λatt, as
deﬁned in the equation, I(x) = I0 e−x/λatt. The attenuation length consists of
two separate components, the absorption length, λabs, describing real absorp-
tion and loss of photons, and the scattering length, λsca, that represents elastic
scattering of photons without any loss. For the elementary photon scattering
they are related by: 1/λatt = 1/λabs+1/λsca. For an actual photon beam one

must take into account the fact that photons can be forward scattered. In
our case the elastic scattering is dominated by Rayleigh scattering, therefore
λsca may be regarded as the Rayleigh scattering length, λR. The knowledge
of refraction index n in the region of the xenon VUV light emission is also
relevant.

The most important among these parameters for the detector performance is
the absorption length λabs, since the energy measurement relies on the total
number of scintillation photons detected by the PMTs that surround and
view the LXe volume from all sides and is therefore not aﬀected by photon
scattering.

The experimental knowledge of these quantities, λatt, λabs, λsca and n for
pure LXe is poor. Especially no measurement of λabs has been made before.
There are also some discrepancies among the available experimental data,
which might partly be explained by the degree of purity of the LXe. As we
shall show later, small amounts of VUV absorbing molecules like H2O or O2,
at the level of a few parts per million, can dramatically change LXe optical
parameters. Thus a reliable determination of optical parameters necessarily
requires monitoring the level and the stability of the xenon purity. In addition
a size of the LXe volume comparable to the absorption/scattering lengths is
needed to make a reasonable measurement of these lengths.

Considering the scintillation mechanism of LXe through the excimer state
Xe∗
2 [14], absorption in pure LXe is improbable, i.e. λabs∼ ∞; any absorption
is thus caused by VUV absorbing impurities. In this paper we report the ﬁrst
measurement of λabs using our prototype and present a signiﬁcant lower limit.

In contrast to the situation for LXe, better information is available for gaseous
xenon (GXe) at various pressures both for visible and VUV light [15,16,17].
One can then examine if optical properties for LXe can be derived from those
for GXe, although this might imply a daring extrapolation in terms of den-
sity. For a non-polar gas like xenon, however, this extrapolation proves to
be valid [8]. One has to ascertain up to which value of photon energies the

3

extrapolation maintains its validity. This point was further investigated by
us [18]; the extrapolation is reliable up to a photon energy of 8.1 eV. At
higher energies and closer to the ﬁrst xenon absorption line at 8.3 eV the
extrapolation is no longer valid. Our prediction for the value of the LXe re-
fractive index at its emission line (7 eV corresponding to the wavelength of
178 nm) is n = 1.65 ± 0.03. Most of the information obtained for GXe in var-
ious physical conditions can be used for reliably predicting other LXe optical
properties [18]. Here we restrict the discussion to the relation between two
quantities: n and λR.

For a dense ﬂuid like LXe λR depends on density and temperature ﬂuctuations
of the medium, according to the Einstein’s expression [19]:

where ǫ is the dielectric constant, κT is the isothermal compressibility, cv is
the speciﬁc heat at constant volume and K is the Boltzmann’s constant.

Since xenon is a non-polar ﬂuid, the second part of Eq. 1 comes out to be
negligible [8,20,21]. The derivative appearing in the ﬁrst part of Eq. 1 can be
computed from the Clausius-Mossotti equation:

where NA is the Avogadro’s number, α(ω) is the molecular polarizability and

This equation establishes therefore a useful relation between the index of re-

3 The 100 ℓ prototype

A schematic view of the prototype detector is shown in Fig. 1. It has an active
volume of 372 × 372 × 496 mm3 (69 ℓ) viewed from all sides by 228 PMTs
assembled into a rectangular shape. The cryostat consists of thermal insulated
vessels equipped with a pulse tube refrigerator [22,23] and a liquid nitrogen

4

cooling pipe. Several sensors are used inside the vessels for monitoring tem-
peratures and pressures. A signal feedthrough that was originally developed
for the ATLAS liquid argon calorimeter [24] is installed on the ﬂange of the
vessel.

Fig. 1. A schematic drawing of the 100 ℓ prototype. Shown on the left is a zoomed
view of the front materials the γ rays traverse.

To minimize γ ray interactions before the active region of the detector, a thin
aluminum plate and a honeycomb window made of stainless steel are used as
an entrance window. Including the PMTs and their holders, the front materials
amount to a total thickness of 0.24 X0, as summarized in Fig. 1.

All the PMTs are immersed in LXe in order to maximize the direct light
collection. The PMTs (HAMAMATSU R6041Q [25]) operate at the LXe tem-
perature and stand up to 0.3 MPa pressure. They have been specially devel-
oped in cooperation with Hamamatsu Photonics K. K. Their properties are
summarized in Table 2. The short axial length of 32 mm is realized by the
adoption of metal channel dynode structure. A synthetic quartz window is
used to allow for the VUV scintillation light [10,26]. The circuit elements that
operate even at the liquid nitrogen temperature were carefully selected for the
voltage dividers.

The detector is equipped with 8 blue LEDs and four 241Am α sources, two
LEDs and one α source on each lateral face, for PMT calibration. Three pairs
of trigger counters (TC1, TC2, and TC3) are placed above and below the
vessel to select cosmic ray muons traversing the LXe for various tests.

4 Detector operations

The detector requires a total of about 100 ℓ of LXe. Some preparations are
needed to bring it into operational conditions. Once in operation, the gains
of the PMTs are measured with the blue LEDs and adjusted by changing
the high voltage. The eﬀective quantum eﬃciencies (QE) are estimated by
measuring scintillation spectra of the α sources in GXe at 170 K, close to the
liquid temperature.

4.1 Liquefaction process

Both the inner and outer vessels are initially evacuated. While being evacu-
ated, the inner vessel is baked at the rather low temperature of 70 ◦C because
of the PMTs and acrylics inside the vessel. After a continuous evacuation for
about ten days, the inner pressure reaches 10−3 Pa.

In order to cool the inner vessel down to 165 K prior to xenon liquefaction
(pre-cooling), it is ﬁrst ﬁlled with GXe at 0.2 MPa and then cooled for a
whole day by the combined action of the pulse tube refrigerator and liquid
nitrogen ﬂowing through a coiled stainless steel pipe in the inner vessel. The
refrigerator, operating quietly with no moving parts near the cooling head,
does not require frequent interruptions for maintenance [23].

When the inner vessel is suﬃciently pre-cooled, xenon is ﬁnally liqueﬁed by
using liquid nitrogen and the refrigerator. GXe ﬂows through a gas puriﬁer

6

(SAES Getter[27]) and molecular ﬁlters (Oxisorbs [28]) before entering the
vessel and getting liqueﬁed. The gas puriﬁer absorbs various contaminants
such as H2O, O2, CO2, N2, and CH4 down to the ppb level. The molecular
ﬁlters act as an additional oxygen trap. It usually takes two days to liquefy
100 ℓ of LXe. The vapor pressure in the inner vessel is continuously monitored
to regulate the ﬂow of liquid nitrogen.

After liquefaction, LXe is maintained at 168 K and 0.13 MPa mainly by the
refrigerator. For the measurement described later in this paper, the detector
was kept in operation continuously for approximately 2000 hours.

After detector operation xenon is recovered to a storage tank. The refrigerator
is turned oﬀ, the outer vessel is ﬁlled with nitrogen gas of room temperature,
and a heater under the PMT holder is switched on to accelerate LXe evapora-
tion. The storage tank is cooled down by liquid nitrogen in order to re-condense
the xenon ﬂowing from the detector vessel. Recovery and warming up of the
cryostat take two and four days, respectively.

4.2 PMT calibration

A precise knowledge of PMT gains and quantum eﬃciencies is necessary to
have an excellent energy resolution. The blue LEDs and the 241Am α sources
placed inside the detector are used for the calibration of the PMTs.

4.2.1 Gain monitoring and adjustment

During data acquisition, that lasted over 2000 hours, the gain of each PMT was
monitored twice a day by ﬂashing, at a time, a pair of LEDs facing each other
at 100 Hz by LED drivers (CAEN C529 [29]) at several diﬀerent intensities. A
typical ADC spectrum of the PMT outputs in one of these LED runs is shown
in Fig. 2 (a). Assuming negligible ﬂuctuations of the LEDs intensity, the gain
g can be given by the following equation:

g =

cσ2
eM

(4)

where c is the charge per ADC channel (200 fC/ch), σ and M are the standard
deviation and the mean of ADC spectrum, respectively, and e is the electron
charge magnitude. Here it is assumed that the number of photoelectrons (Npe)
observed on a PMT is reasonably large so that the spectrum can be regarded
as Gaussian. In practice we have to consider a contribution from the pedestal

7

as in the following equation:

σ2 = g

(M − M0) + σ2
0,

e
c

(5)

where M0 and σ0 are the mean and the standard deviation of the pedestal.
Fig. 2 (b) shows an example of the linear relation between σ2 and M. The gain
of the PMT is evaluated by ﬁtting the data with Eq. 5. To evaluate reliability
of the obtained results, the procedure was repeated both by using diﬀerent
LED pairs and by using the same pair in several consecutive runs. The results
were reproduced within 0.9 % in FWHM, which gives a negligible contribution
to the energy resolution of the detector.

4.2.2 Determination of quantum eﬃciencies

Quantum eﬃciencies (QEs) of the PMTs depend on the temperature and the
light wavelength and must be evaluated in the operational conditions. They
were evaluated by using the α sources with 0.13 MPa GXe at 170 K. The
use of gaseous xenon is necessary to avoid scattering and possible absorption
of the scintillation photons, which are more prominent in liquid phase. The
scintillation spectra in liquid and gaseous phases are not much diﬀerent [9,30].

QEs for individual PMTs were evaluated by comparing the measured spectra
with a GEANT3 simulation [31]. The obtained QE distribution for all the
PMTs is shown in Fig. 3. The low values and the broad spread of QEs are
thought to be due to the increased photo-cathode resistivity at low tempera-

The α sources were also used for monitoring the stability of the PMTs during
the data taking in liquid phase. It is found that the PMT outputs stabilize in
about 50 hours after the liquefaction and are stable within 0.5 % thereafter.

5 Xenon puriﬁcation

LXe should in principle be transparent to its own scintillation light thanks to
∗
2 [14]. However possi-
the scintillation mechanism through the excimer state Xe
ble contaminants in LXe, such as water and oxygen at ppm level, considerably
absorb scintillation light [32,33].

In Fig. 4 (a) the absorption coeﬃcient for VUV light is shown for 1 ppm
contamination of water vapor. The absorption spectra of water and oxygen
largely overlap with the xenon scintillation spectrum. Given these absorption
coeﬃcients and neglecting the scattering (λabs<λR), we calculated the light
intensity as a function of the distance from the light source for various con-
centrations of the contaminant. The result is shown in Fig. 4 (b) for water.
Since water tends to absorb light with shorter wavelengths, only a compo-
nent with longer wavelengths survives for a long distance. This might explain
the discrepancies among the measurements of the LXe refractive index n, as n

1 New types of PMTs have been recently developed by coating Al strips on the
quartz window to reduce the resistivity and by using more standard photo-cathode
material to ease the evaporation procedure. A preliminary measurement shows their
QEs are about 15–20 %.

As we already noted, xenon is well puriﬁed before ﬁlling the detector vessel,
but some inner components of the prototype are made of G10 and acrylic
that are known to absorb and desorb water. During the initial stage of the
prototype operation, a strong absorption of scintillation light was observed.
After systematic studies on the residual gas by means of mass spectroscopy
and build-up tests, we concluded that water at the ppm level seemed to be
desorbed from the detector material into LXe.

We therefore introduced a circulation-puriﬁcation system, as schematically
shown in Fig. 5, to remove the water. In this system, xenon, taken from the
bottom of the vessel through the Teﬂon tube and evaporated by the heat
exchanger, is pumped by a diaphragm pump and circulated through the gas
puriﬁers and the molecular ﬁlters, and is ﬁnally condensed back into the de-
tector. The ﬂow rate of GXe is about 500 cm3/min, hence the whole volume
could be circulated in a few month time. We also carried out various tests to
study the puriﬁcation process, such as stopping or changing the ﬂow rate and
bypassing the puriﬁers or the ﬁlters.

6 Absorption length estimate

Puriﬁcation was continuously performed for over 1200 hours. To evaluate and
monitor light absorption in LXe separately from Rayleigh scattering during
puriﬁcation, we used cosmic ray muons as well as the α sources.

The total number of photoelectrons collected by all the PMTs (Npe) for each
cosmic ray event, being sensitive only to the loss of the scintillation photons,
is a good measure of the light absorption. In Fig. 6 (a), Npe is plotted as a
function of time. It increased by a factor four in about one month (700 hours)
and almost saturated. A comparison with a Monte Carlo simulation indicates
that λabs increased from ∼ 10 cm to above 1 m.

In Fig. 6 (b) the relative changes in the α peaks of the PMTs located at certain
distances (7.6 cm and 11.6 cm) from the α sources are plotted. For the PMTs
at a longer distance, the PMT outputs increased much more signiﬁcantly and
saturated slightly later, just as expected for the light absorption in LXe.

We ﬁrst made a crude estimate of the Rayleigh scattering length by using the
PMTs located on the same face as the α source; these PMTs can not directly
see the scintillation light from the α particles but only the scattered light. Our
data prefer values of λR= 40 - 50 cm, which are consistent with the numbers
currently available in the literature [6,8,11,12,13].

Fig. 7. The PMT outputs normalized either to those in the GXe data (a) or to the
MC simulation without absorption (b) are plotted as a function of the source-PMT
distance at the beginning (open circles) and after puriﬁcation (closed circles). The
solid lines are ﬁtted results.

To evaluate the absorption length λabs, we compared the PMT outputs in the
LXe to those in the GXe and to a Monte Carlo simulation with no absorption
and a variable λR. Note that both absorption and scattering are negligible in
the GXe. In Fig. 7 the PMT outputs normalized either to those in the GXe (a)
or to the MC simulation with λR= 45 cm (b) are plotted against the source-
PMT distance. Here the distributions at the beginning of puriﬁcation (open
circles) and after one month of puriﬁcation (closed circles) are compared. The
evident exponential decline at the beginning almost vanished after puriﬁcation.

These distributions were then ﬁtted with exponential functions. From the
comparison with the GXe data an eﬀective attenuation length of 54+14
−9 cm
was obtained after the puriﬁcation. This eﬀective length contains the eﬀects of
both the absorption and the Rayleigh scattering. Since the scattered photons
are not totally lost but may be detected by other PMTs, the obtained eﬀective
attenuation length is longer than λatt and, especially if λabs≫λR, it is longer
than λR. Note that the LXe/GXe ratio is larger than unity since the ratio of
the scintillation yields in LXe and GXe is approximately 2.7 [34].

The comparison with the simulation does not show a signiﬁcant slope. We used
this result to establish a lower limit on the absorption length λabs of 90 cm
at 90 % conﬁdence level, where λR was varied from 30 cm to 50 cm in the
simulation. Before the puriﬁcation λabs was 12.0 ± 1.8 cm. We conclude that
the level of water content after the puriﬁcation was much lower than 100 ppb.

After successful puriﬁcation of LXe under the operational conditions, eﬀorts
have been focused on reducing the initial amount of water contamination in

12

the vessel. We replaced most of the acrylic parts with Teﬂon to suppress out-
gassing in the inner chamber, which resulted in an initial absorption length
λabs of 30 cm in the subsequent operation. A lower limit on the absorption
length λabs of 100 cm at 90 % conﬁdence level was then achieved in a much
shorter time of xenon puriﬁcation, in about 300 hours.

We are also developing a liquid-phase puriﬁcation system with a ﬂuid pump
to increase the puriﬁcation eﬃciency. In such a system the circulation speed
could be increased up to 100 ℓ/hour of LXe, more than 1000 times faster than
the current system.

7 Expected detector performance

In this section we estimate the performance of the 100 ℓ LXe prototype for
52.8 MeV γ rays that are expected from the µ+ → e+γ decays.

Simulations show that the determination of the incident positions of the γ rays
is only slightly aﬀected by absorption and Rayleigh scattering. On the contrary
the energy resolution is heavily dependent on the absorption mainly because of
ﬂuctuations in light collection eﬃciency. For a short absorption length the total
amount of light collected by the PMTs depends strongly on the positions of
the energy deposits. Although corrections for the ﬁrst γ ray conversion points
may be straightforward, the total light yield just ﬂuctuates according with the
event-by-event shower ﬂuctuations. We therefore concentrate on the detector
performance in energy measurement of γ rays in the following.

For negligible absorption (i.e. λabs≫ the detector size) the γ ray energy may
be simply evaluated by the total sum of the photons collected by all the PMTs,
possibly weighted by the local density of the PMTs. For a ﬁnite absorption
length, however, a better method of summing the PMT outputs is necessary.

The γ ray energy E may be calculated as a linear sum of the PMT outputs
Qi with arbitrary coeﬃcients ci:

Using the linear ﬁt, a reconstructed energy spectrum for 52.8 MeV monochro-
matic γ rays that uniformly irradiate the center of the detector face is shown
in Fig. 8. The spectrum has an asymmetric shape. The lower tail is caused
by interactions of the γ rays in the materials before the LXe and by a leak-
age of shower components (mostly low energy γ rays). Most important for
the µ+ → e+γ experiment is the resolution at the upper edge (σu) to reject
background events, while the lower tail concerns the detection eﬃciency. The
spectrum was ﬁtted to the following function to evaluate σu:

in Fig. 9 as a function of the absorption lengths assumed in the simulation.
The resolutions for two incident positions A and B described in the inset of
Fig. 9 are similar, indicating a small position dependence. The resolutions are
also stable by changing λR= 30 − 50 cm and for n = 1.57 − 1.72 for LXe. Note
that in the simulation refraction, reﬂection and absorption of the scintillation
light at the PMT quartz windows are taken into account.

Absorption Length  λ abs [cm]

Fig. 9. The expected energy resolutions for 52.8 MeV γ rays as a function of the
absorption length. Resolutions at two incident positions, in the middle of four PMTs
(A) and at the center of one PMT (B), as sketched in the inset, are compared.

With the achieved absorption length of λabs> 100 cm an energy resolution of
4 % FWHM and σu/E ∼ 1.2 %, averaged over the detector acceptance, is ex-
pected from the Monte Carlo simulation. The detection eﬃciency is estimated
to be approximately 60 % for λabs> 50 cm if selected within ±4 % around the
energy peak.

8 Summary

We are developing a LXe γ ray detector for the MEG experiment. A 100 ℓ
prototype with an active volume of 372 × 372 × 496 mm3 was constructed to
examine its performance for 52.8-MeV γ rays that are expected from µ+ → e+γ
decays. We have established a long stable operation of this new type of device
by successfully running it for approximately 2000 hours without interruptions.

Absorption of the vacuum ultra violet scintillation light of xenon by possible
impurities might critically limit the performance of the detector. We developed
a method to evaluate absorption of scintillation light in LXe, separately from
Rayleigh scattering, by measuring cosmic rays and α sources attached inside
the detector. It was found that a ppm level contamination of water is the prime
cause of light absorption in LXe. By introducing a suitable puriﬁcation system,
an absorption length longer than 100 cm at 90 % C.L. has been achieved.

A Monte Carlo simulation study shows that, with an absorption length of
100 cm or longer, an energy resolution of 4 % in FWHM and an upper edge
resolution of σu/E = 1.2 % are expected.

To verify the detector performance, the prototype has been recently irradiated
by high energy γ rays from laser Compton back-scatterings and from π0 decays
in the charge exchange reactions, π− + p → π0 + n. Analyses of these data are
in progress and the results will be reported elsewhere.

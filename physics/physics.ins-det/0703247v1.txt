Abstract

The CERN to Gran Sasso Neutrino beam (CNGS) was commissioned at CERN in early August 2006
and was ﬁrst sent at low intensity to Gran Sasso on August 17, 2006. The Borexino, LVD and OPERA
detectors continued the commissioning of their detectors and started taking data with practically no dead
time. The CNGS operated smoothly with good quality. In a short time the 3 detectors collected several
hundred events with clean time distributions.

1 Introduction

Neutrino physics has opened new windows into phenomena beyond the Standard Model of
particle physics. Long baseline neutrino experiments may allow further insight into neutrino
physics. The CERN to Gran Sasso neutrino beam (CNGS) is one of these projects [1]; it
was commissioned at CERN in early august 2006 and it started sending beam to the Gran
Sasso Lab. (LNGS) on the 17th of August 2006. At Gran Sasso 3 detectors, Borexino, LVD
and OPERA, were ready to use it, and imediately started to see beam neutrino events.
ντ
OPERA [2] is a hybrid-emulsion-electronic detector, designed to search for the νµ ←→
oscillations in the parameter region indicated by the MACRO [3], SuperKamiokande [4] and
Soudan2 [5] atmospheric neutrino results [6], recently conﬁrmed by the K2K [7] and MINOS
[8] long baseline experiments. One of the main goals of OPERA is to ﬁnd the ντ appearance
by direct detection of the τ lepton from ντ CC interactions. The detection of the ντ will be
made via the charged τ lepton produced in ντ CC interactions, and its decay products. To
1 µm is necessary; this resolution is obtained
observe the decays, a spatial resolution of
in emulsion sheets interspersed with thin lead target plates. This technique, the “Emulsion
Cloud Chamber” (ECC), was started in the τ search experiment [9]. OPERA may also
νe oscillations and make a variety of observations with or
search for the subleading νµ ←→
without the beam using its electronic subdetectors.

LVD is an array of 840 liquid scintillators with a total mass of 1000 t; it is designed
to search and study neutrinos from gravitational stellar collapses [10]. LVD plans to be a
neutrino ﬂux monitor of the CNGS beam.

Borexino is a reﬁned electronic detector designed to study solar neutrinos, in particular
the monoenergetic neutrinos coming from Be7 decay [11].
In August 2006 it was only
partially ﬁlled with water: now it is completely ﬁlled with water and its inner part is
partially ﬁlled with liquid scintillator.

In this lecture note will be summarized and discussed the CNGS neutrino beam, some
features of the Borexino, LVD, and OPERA experiments, and the preliminary results
obtained by the three experiments during the August 2006 test run.

km neutrino trajectory from CERN to Gran Sasso.

2 The CNGS neutrino beam

Fig. 1 top shows the main components of the νµ beam at CERN [1]. A 400 GeV proton
beam is extracted from the SPS and is transported to the CNGS target. Secondary pions
and kaons of positive charge are focused into a parallel beam by two magnetic lenses, called
horn and reﬂector. A long decay pipe allows the pions and kaons to decay into νµ and µ.
The remaining hadrons are absorbed in a beam dump. The muons are monitored by two
sets of detectors downstream of the dump.

Fig. 1 bottom shows the 730 km path of the CNGS neutrinos from CERN to Gran
Sasso. The beam is optimised for producing a maximum number of CC ντ interactions in
OPERA at Gran Sasso. Fig. 2 left shows the underground layout of the SPS and of CNGS
at CERN; Fig. 2 right shows the scheme of the SPS operation during the August 2006 test
run. The energy distribution of the beam at Gran Sasso is shown in Fig. 3: the mean νµ
beam energy is 17 GeV, the ¯νµ contamination is
2%, the νe ( ¯νe) is < 1% and the number
of ντ is negligible. The L/Eν ratio is 43 km/GeV. The muon beam size at the second muon
detector at CERN is about σ
1 m; this translates into a neutrino beam size at GS of

σ
1 km. Civil engineering was completed in june 2006, all beam parts were installed and
commissioning was made in early August. The ﬁrst low intensity test beam was expected
at GS in August 17 2006: this happened, and almost immediately the 3 detectors at GS
obtained their ﬁrst events (Figs. 6, 10). The low intensity CNGS was stable and of high
quality. The shared SPS beam sent a pulse of 2 neutrino bursts, each of 10.5 µsec duration,
separated by 50 ms, every 12 s [1]. A higher intensity beam was expected for October 2006,
but it did not happen because of a water leak in the beam at CERN.

3 BOREXINO

The main aim of the BOREXINO detector is the measurement of the monochromatic νe’s
coming from Be7 decays in the center of the sun. The layout of BOREXINO in Hall C is
shown in Fig. 4 [11]. The most important part of the detector is the large sphere, whose
central part should be ﬁlled with liquid scintillator. The outer sphere should be ﬁlled with
pure water. The ﬁlling with water was started in early August and during the ﬁrst run
only few meters of water were in the sphere. The partial ﬁlling limited the data acquisition.
Nevertheless 5 neutrino candidate events were observed. In December 2006 the water ﬁlling
was completed and initial ﬁlling with liquid scintillator in the inner sphere was started.

4 LVD

The main purpose of the LVD detector is the search for electron antineutrinos from
gravitational stellar collapses in our galaxy. LVD is made of three identical “towers”, each
1.5 m3, ﬁlled with
containing 8 active modules; a module has 8 counters of dimension 1
1.2 t of liquid scintillator. Fig. 5 shows the LVD detector located in Hall A of Gran Sasso;
it has a total mass of 1000 t [10]. Neutrinos from the CNGS beam are observed through:
(i) the detection of muons produced in neutrino CC interactions in the surrounding rock
or in the detector, (ii) through the detection of the hadrons produced in neutrino NC/CC
interactions inside the detector.

LVD plans to be a neutrino ﬂux monitor of CNGS at Gran Sasso. Since LVD is running
since several years, it was completely ready when the neutrino beam arrived. Fig. 6a shows
a muon coming from a νµ interaction in the rock before the detector; Fig. 6b shows a νµ
In the August 2006 test run LVD was counting
NC/CC interaction inside the detector.
50-100 muons per day and recorded a total of about 500 events [10].

detector; (b) a multihadron event originated by a νµ NC/CC interaction inside the detector.

5 OPERA

The OPERA detector, Fig. 7, is a hybrid detector made of two identical supermodules, each
consisting of a target section with 31 target planes of lead/emulsion-ﬁlm modules (“bricks”),

of a scintillator tracker detector and of a muon spectrometer. The initial target mass should
be 1.8 kt. It is the ﬁrst detector speciﬁcally designed for the CNGS ν beam.

Figure 7: Layout of the OPERA detector.

Electronic subdetectors. The ﬁrst electronic subdetector is an anticoincidence wall to
better separate muon events coming from interactions in OPERA from those in the material
and rock before OPERA.

The target tracker is made of 32000 scintillator strips, each 7 m long and of 25 mm
15
mm cross section (7000 m2 area). Along the strip, a wavelength shifting ﬁbre of 1 mm
diameter transmits the light signals to both ends. The readout is done by 1000 64 channel
Hamamatsu PhotoMultipliers (PMTs).

×

The muon spectrometer consists of 2 iron magnets instrumented with Resistive Plate
8 m2 dipole with a ﬁeld of 1.52 T
Chambers (RPC) and drift tubes. Each magnet is an 8
in the upward direction on one side and in the downward direction on the other side. This
allows to measure the momentum twice, reducing the error by √2. A magnet consists of
twelve 5 cm thick iron slabs, alternated with RPC planes. In the magnetic ﬁeld a muon is
tracked, identiﬁed and its momentum is measured.

The precision tracker [12] measures the muon track coordinates in the horizontal plane.
8 m2; they are placed in front
It is made of 12 drift tube planes, each covering an area of 8
and behind each magnet and between the two magnets. The muon spectrometer allows a
momentum resolution ∆p/p
0.25 for muon momenta < 25 GeV/c. Two planes of glass
RPC’s (XPC’s), consisting of two 45◦ crossed planes, are installed in front of the magnets.
In August 2006 the brick supporting structure, the tracker planes, the XPC’s and three
of the high precision tracker planes of the ﬁrst supermodule were installed. The magnets,
including all RPC’s and the mechanical structure were completed.

The DAQ system uses a Gigabit network of 1150 nodes. To match the data of the diﬀerent
subdetectors an event “time stamp” is delivered by a clock using the Global Positioning
System (GPS). The synchronization with the beam spill is done via GPS. The DAQ uses a

system which contains the CPU, the memory, the clock receiver for the time stamp and the
ethernet connections to the other components.

The commissioning of each electronic subdetector was made ﬁrst with cosmic ray muons

and then with the CNGS at reduced intensity in August 2006.

Two additional emulsion sheets, the changeable sheets (CS), are glued on its downstream
face. The bricks are arranged in walls. Within a brick, the achieved spatial resolution is
< 1 µm and the angular resolution is
2 mrad. To provide a ν interaction trigger and to
identify the brick in which the interaction took place, the brick walls are complemented by
walls of target trackers and a muon spectrometer [15].

The bricks are made by the Brick Assembling Machine (BAM), which consists of robots
for the mechanical packing of the bricks. The BAM is installed in the Gran Sasso lab and it
1 brick every 1-2 minutes. The bricks are handled by the Brick Manipulator
may produce
System (BMS), made of two robots, each operating at one side of the detector. An arm is
used to insert the bricks. The extraction of a brick, in the region indicated by the electronic
detectors, is done by a vacuum sucker of the BMS.

A fast automated scanning system is needed to cope with the daily analysis of a large
20 cm2/h per
number of emulsion sheets. The minimum required scanning speed is
emulsion layer (44 µm thick).
It corresponds to an increase in speed of one order of
magnitude with respect to past systems [13, 14]. For this purpose were developed the
European Scanning System (ESS) in Europe [16] and the S-UTS in Japan [17].

The main components of the ESS microscope are shown in Fig. 8 left: (i) a high quality,
rigid and vibration-free support table; (ii) a motor driven scanning stage for horizontal
(XY) motion; (iii) a granite arm; (iv) a motor driven stage mounted vertically (Z) on the
granite arm for focusing; (v) optics; (vi) digital camera for image grabbing mounted on
the vertical stage; (vii) an illumination system. The emulsion is placed on a glass plate
(emulsion holder) and its ﬂatness is guaranteed by a vacuum system. By adjusting the focal
plane of the objective, the 44 µm emulsion thickness is spanned and 16 tomographic images
of each ﬁeld of view are taken at equally spaced depths. The images are digitized, converted
into a grey scale of 256 levels, sent to a vision processor board and analyzed to recognize

(microtrack) is reconstructed by combining clusters belonging to images at diﬀerent levels.
Each microtrack pair is connected across the plastic base to form the base track. A set of
connected base tracks forms a volume track. The Japanese S-UTS system, Fig. 8 right,
is based on hardware designed and made in Nagoya; the software system is mounted in
specially designed electronic boards.

6 The ﬁrst test run with CNGS neutrinos. Conclusions

A detailed description of the CNGS operation during the August test run may be found in
1017 p.o.t. was delivered. The accuracy
[1]. During this run an integrated intensity of 7.6
in the time synchronization between CERN and Gran Sasso was better than 100 ns. The
beam time spill is shown in Fig. 9. Event samples recorded by LVD and OPERA are shown
in Figs. 6 and 10, respectively.

electronic detectors (black points). The histogram is the prediction from cosmic simulations. The inset
shows the on-time beam muon events.

OPERA recorded 319 neutrino events, consistent with the 300 events expected on the
basis of the delivered integrated intensity. The θ angular distribution with respect to the
horizontal axis is shown in Fig. 11. In the same ﬁgure, the distribution of simulated cosmic-
ray muons is also shown. In the inset is shown the angular distribution of beam events; a
Gaussian ﬁt to the θ angle distribution of these events on-time with the beam yielded a mean
muon angle of 3.4◦ in agreement with the value of 3.3◦, expected for neutrinos originating
from CERN and travelling under the earth surface to the LNGS underground halls.

During the August test run a succesful test of the CS procedure was performed by using
20 individual CS doublets inserted
an emulsion detector plane consisting of a matrix of 15
in the SM2 target. 9 muons produced by neutrino interactions in the rock surrounding the
detector crossed the CS plane surface; most of them were found by scanning the emulsion

ﬁlms, see Fig 12. The test proved the capability in passing from the centimetre scale of the
electronic tracker resolution to the micrometric resolution of nuclear emulsions.

In conclusion the CNGS neutrino beam performed well in the ﬁrst test run. And the

Borexino, LVD and OPERA experiments at Gran Sasso recorded a number of events.

In particular OPERA recorded 319 muon events in agreement with expectations. The
reconstructed zenith-angle distribution from muon tracks in centered at 3.4◦, as expected for
neutrinos originating at CERN and travelling under the earth surface to LNGS. A test of the
association between muon tracks reconstructed by electronic detectors and with emulsions
was successfully performed, proving the capability of passing from the centimeter scale of
electronic detectors to the micron scale of nuclear emulsions.

I would like to acknowledge the cooperation of the CNGS team at CERN, of the LNGS staﬀ, and of the
Borexino, LVD and OPERA experiments. I thank Ms. A. Casoni for typing the manuscript and Dr. M.

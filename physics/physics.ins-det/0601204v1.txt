Abstract

One option at the International Linear Collider is to convert the electron beams
into high energy photon beams by Compton scattering a few millimetres in front of
the interaction region. Selected physics channels for this option have been analysed
and technical issues have been studied. So far no showstoppers for this option have
been found.

1 Introduction

Collisions between photons are interesting in many respects. Up to now they
could only be realised in e+e− colliders as collisions between virtual or quasi-
real photons radiated oﬀ the electrons. This had the big disadvantage that the
photon energy on average is much lower than the energy of the electrons.

Contrary to a storage ring, in an e+e− linear collider the beams collide only
once. It should thus be possible to convert the electrons into high energy
photons by scattering them on a high power laser a few mm in front of the
interaction point [1]. If the laser wavelength is chosen correctly photon energies
up to 80% of the electron beam energy can be achieved.

There are several reasons why a photon collider is interesting for particle
physics [2]. Photons couple equally to all charged particles. Since there are
no interferences involved in the process and the particles are produced via t-
channel exchange the cross sections are in most cases signiﬁcantly larger than
in e+e−. In most cases these cross sections are just given by the charge of the
produced particles and phase space factors. This makes the production less
interesting than in e+e−, where the non-trivial weak couplings of the particles
can be measured. However, the large and model independent cross section
oﬀers an excellent possibility to study the decays of the produced particles.
In the case of W-production their gauge couplings can be measured, where
W+W− is only sensitive to the photon couplings of the W without
γγ
uncertainties from the Z. Neutral particles can couple to photons only via
loops. The particles running in the loops can be too heavy to be produced at
the collider, but their eﬀect can be measured from the production cross section
of a neutral particle. The production of Higgs bosons is very interesting in this
respect, since the coupling of the Higgses to photons is sensitive to all charged
particles that receive their mass from the Higgs mechanism and for example
in SUSY models also to their superpartners.

In addition to the γγ mode a photon collider can also be used as an eγ col-
lider. There is a signiﬁcant eγ luminosity in the γγ mode due to unconverted
electrons, denoted as parasitic eγ mode in the following. If needed, also only
one beam can be converted to get a larger eγ luminosity with less background.

The detailed layout of a photon collider depends on the parameters of the
linear accelerator. Especially the time structure of the beam inﬂuences directly
the layout of the laser system. In this paper the layout of the TESLA machine
[3] will be used. The design of the ILC is not yet ﬁnalised, but the time
structure will be very similar to the ones studied for TESLA [4]. A principle
layout of a photon collider at TESLA is presented in [2].

The high energy photons at a photon collider are produced by Compton scat-
tering of a high energy electron beam with a high power laser. From pure
kinematics the maximum photon energy ωm is given by

ω0 and λ denote the photon energy and wavelength of the laser and αl denotes
the crossing angle between the laser and the electron beam. In the approxima-
tion the assumption cos αl/2 = 1 is used which is always fulﬁlled in praxis. It
is desirable to keep x below 4.8, since for larger x the invariant mass between
a high energy photon and a laser photon is above the e+e− pair production
threshold, so that the high energy photons are lost again due their interaction
with the laser. The most powerful solid state lasers have a wavelength around
λ

1µm resulting in x = 4.75 for a 250 GeV beam.

The right plot of ﬁgure 1 shows the photon helicity for diﬀerent values of the

constant polarisation in the high energy peak with a strong variation at lower
energies.

−

The photon spectrum in a real collider is more complicated than the one given
from pure Compton scattering for two reasons. The Compton cross section
rises for smaller centre of mass energies. The electrons that have interacted
once have thus a high chance to interact a second time giving rise to a much
enhanced spectrum at low photon energies. In addition the laser power is so
high that non-linear eﬀects have to be taken into account [5,6,7,8]. They can
be parametrised by the parameter

ξ2 =

e2 ¯F 2~2
m2c2ω2
0

=

eλ

2nγr2
α

where ¯F denotes the ﬁeld strength of the laser ﬁeld and nγ the corresponding
photon density. The non-linear eﬀects modify the photon spectrum in two
ways. The eﬀective electron mass increases by a factor (1 + ξ2) reducing the
maximum energy to ωm/E0 = x/(1 + x + ξ2). At the same time a high energy
tail develops due to the simultaneous interaction of one electron with several
laser photons. Figure 2 shows the photon energy spectrum for diﬀerent ξ2.

For the calculation of the luminosity spectrum one has to take into account
that lower energy photons are produced at larger angles with respect to the
original beam direction so that their luminous spot is larger, reducing the
luminosity for low centre of mass energies. To calculate the photon spectrum in
a real collider, simulation programs have to be used. In this paper the program
CAIN [9] is used which calculates the beam-laser as well as the beam-beam
interaction taking non-linearity and beam polarisation eﬀects into account.
Figure 3 shows the γγ centre of mass energy spectrum and polarisation for
the chosen laser parameters and √see = 500 GeV.

1.1.2 Machine Parameters

A photon collider will be operated with two electron beams instead of an elec-
tron and a positron beam for several reasons. Electrons can be polarised to a
higher degree than positrons resulting in a more favourable luminosity spec-
trum. Two electron beams defocus each other in the interaction point generat-

ing less beamstrahlung than electron-positron interactions. Electron-electron
interactions result in no annihilation events which would be a background for
the high energy γγ interactions. Since the beamstrahlung for identical beam
parameters is smaller at the γγ collider than in the e+e− case, the beams
can be focused stronger resulting in a higher luminosity. Table 1 compares
a set of conservative [3] and optimistic [2] parameters with the ones of the
e+e− collider [3] for a beam energy of 250 GeV. For the optimistic set a third
of the e+e− luminosity can be obtained in the high energy part of the spec-
trum. Since the optimistic set results in higher backgrounds it will be used
consistently in this paper. To reach the same physics results with the more

conservative set the running time has to be doubled. The total luminosity with
= 1035cm−2s−1, where about 10% are in the
the optimistic design is around
interesting high energy region. In the physics studies presented in section 2, it
will be assumed that a year of running corresponds to 107 seconds at design
luminosity.

from each other by a rotation of the coordinate system. Weak processes violate
parity, especially the W couples only to left-handed fermions. For this reason
the sign of Jz is important for many processes in eγ.

Because of the large disruption of the electron beam in the interaction with
the laser the spent beam cannot leave the detector through the hole of the
incoming one which is limited by the aperture of the ﬁnal quadrupole. For this
reason a crossing angle is needed. The exact value depends on the size of the
ﬁnal focus quadrupole. This study assumes a value of α = 35 mrad, however
with recent quadrupole designs [10] a smaller angle seems possible.

1.1.3 Beam simulation

For the simulation of the laser-beam and beam-beam interactions many eﬀects
must be taken into account. In the laser-beam interaction non-linear eﬀects are
important where the non-linearity varies with space and time and particles can
interact several times before they leave the interaction region. In the beam-
beam interactions apart from the interesting high-energy events one has to
consider coherent eﬀects of a particle from one bunch interacting with the
coherent ﬁeld of the opposing bunch, so called beamstrahlung, and incoherent
interactions of single particles from the two bunches. In addition all processes
can inﬂuence the polarisation of the particles.

All processes are included in the simulation program CAIN [9] which has been
used throughout this paper. Where possible CAIN has been checked against
GuineaPig [11] and the program of V. Telnov [12]. Reasonable agreement has
been found in all cases when a comparison is possible.

For physics studies the beam simulations are not appropriate and fast pro-
grams have been developed which generate the interacting beam particles and
have been tuned to the beam simulation programs. For the studies presented
in this paper the programs CIRCE2 [13], based on a histograming technique,
and CompAZ [14], based on analytic parameterisations, have been used.

energy part of the spectrum.

2 The Physics Case for a γγ Collider

Photons couple to all charged particles and via loops also to neutral particles
like the Higgs. The pair production of charged particles proceeds via t-channel
exchange where the energy suppression in the propagator is smaller than for
s-channel production. The typical cross sections in γγ are thus signiﬁcantly
larger than in e+e−. The couplings of photons to charged particles are also
well known so that the cross section can be calculated reliably, contrary to
e+e−, where the production normally proceeds via photon and Z exchange,
where both amplitudes and their relative phase need to be known. On one
hand this makes the production cross section in γγ much less interesting than
in e+e−. On the other hand the large samples can be used to learn about the
decay properties of the produced particles. Figure 5 compares the production
cross section of several particles in e+e−, eγ and γγ [15].

The physics case of the γγ collider is largely complementary to e+e− [16]. While
in γγ the decays can be studied e+e− measured the production mechanism in
great detail.

A summary of interesting physics channels can be found in [2,17]. In the
following a few examples that are of special interest in the motivation of the
γγ collider will be discussed.

2.1 Pileup

·

→

The cross section γγ
hadrons is several hundred nb, relatively indepen-
dent on the centre of mass energy [18]. The total γγ luminosity is
=
1035cm−2s−1 mainly concentrated at low centre of mass energy (see Fig. 3),
1.0
corresponding to several µb−1 per bunch crossing. This leads to one to two
γγ
hadrons events per bunch crossing, depending on the centre of mass
energy, √see, and running mode, that overlay the physics events of interest
(pileup). In the physics studies these events are taken from a database [19]
and added to the physics events with the right frequency. For the 337 ns bunch
spacing at TESLA the bunch crossing can be tagged unambiguously for every
track so that only single bunch crossings need to be considered.

→

L

→

Since the γγ
hadrons events are induced by quark t-channel exchange and
have on average a rather large boost in one direction most tracks are concen-
trated at low angles (Fig. 6). For analyses of channels where most particles are
in the central region, like γγ
H a large part of the pileup can be rejected
by a simple cut on the polar angle.

300 µm leading to a beamspot length
The bunch length at TESLA is σz ≈
of 200 µm. This is much larger than the impact parameter resolution of the
microvertex detector which is around 5 µm for large momenta. The measure-

9

ment of the impact parameter of a particle along the beam axis with respect
to the primary vertex can thus also be used to separate tracks from the high
energy signal and the pileup. Fig. 7 shows the impact parameter in z divided
W+W− and from pileup and the eﬃciency
by its error for tracks from γγ
for a cut in this variable. For a loss of only 5-10% of the signal tracks about
half of the tracks from pileup can be rejected. If enough tracks to reconstruct
the primary vertex are in the central part of the detector and only tracks in
this region need to be considered for the analysis 85% of the pileup tracks can
be rejected with only a 1% loss of signal tracks. This analysis was done for a
channel without b-quarks in the events. In this case the primary vertex can
simply be calculated as the mean momentum weighted z-impact parameter 2 .
In events with a large b-quark contents like Higgs production similar results
are expected, however a more sophisticated vertex reconstruction is needed.

For physics, where the tracks are peaked in the forward region, like the pro-
duction of W-bosons, the pileup events are a severe problem. In addition the
pileup contributes roughly 15 hits per layer in the microvertex detector. This
dominates over the hits from beam beam interactions in the outer three layers

In the framework of the standard model, the generation of mass of both
fermions and gauge bosons occurs through interactions with the same scalar
particle, the Higgs boson. By the time a Photon Collider is constructed the
Higgs boson will certainly be discovered. Therefore the aim of this machine

Typical selection variables are: the visible energy of the event; the longitudinal
imbalance in the event, the cosine of the thrust angle and the output of the
Neural Network [30] for tagging bottom quarks for the fastest two energetic
jets in the event.

The reconstructed invariant mass for the selected signal and background pro-
cesses is shown in Figure 8a if no pileup is overlaid and in Figure 8b when
1 pileup event is considered per bunch crossing. To enhance the signal a cut
on the invariant mass is tuned such that the statistical signiﬁcance of the
signal over background is maximised. Events in the mass region of 116 GeV
< Mjj < 132 GeV are selected. The number of estimated signal and back-
ground events in this window are 3676 and 2317, respectively.

The two photon decay width of the Higgs boson is proportional to the event
rates of the Higgs signal. The statistical error of the number of signal events,

The C and P conserving couplings κγ and λγ [31,32] have been analysed in
both processes [33,34]. Since in both cases the beam energy varies and in
addition there is a missing neutrino in eγ, a neutrino from a W decay cannot
be reconstructed from the missing four-momentum, only hadronic W-decays
have been used in the analysis. However this is by far not such a large problem
as in e+e− since there is no need to separate the W + from the W −. Only the
sign of the W-helicity cannot be measured in this case.

their z-impact parameter is inconsistent with the primary vertex. In addition
tracks are rejected if they are far away from the reconstructed W-axis where
the cut is stronger if the tracks are in the forward region. Figure 10 shows
the reconstructed W mass and energy distribution using all tracks, the tracks
that pass the impact parameter cut and the tracks that pass in addition the
angle cuts. The large tails get reduced signiﬁcantly by the cuts for the price
of a worse mass resolution. In a second step events are selected by a cut on
the reconstructed mass and energy of the W. These cuts result in an eﬃciency
of 73% (66%) with a purity of 64% (49%) in the real (parasitic) mode. The
background is extremely forward peaked and an additional cut of θW > 5◦
results in a purity of 95% (72%) basically without a loss in eﬃciency.

The events are ﬁtted using a Monte Carlo reweighting technique where Whizard
[35] is used as a generator. In the ﬁt the W production angle, the two decay
angles and the energy are used. In addition to the triple gauge couplings a
free normalisation constant is ﬁtted, where the normalisation is constrained to
unity with an assumed error on the eﬃciency and luminosity determination.

Table 2 summarises the results for diﬀerent ﬁt assumptions assuming one year
of running. The precision on κγ depends mainly in the precision on the total
cross section and thus on the assumed normalisation error. λγ has only little
sensitivity to the normalisation but is more sensitive to pileup and background.
The correlation between ∆κγ and ∆λγ is negligible in all cases.

Several sources of systematic errors have been considered. Assuming ∆
=
0.1% the beam polarisation needs to be known to 0.1% in order that ∆κγ is not
dominated by this error. At the same time the background has to be known to
a precision of better than 3% in the real mode and 1% in the parasitic mode.
λγ is basically not sensitive to both variations. Both coupling constants are
not sensitive to realistic variations in the luminosity spectrum.

Since there are always two W-bosons in the event, typically at low angles,

anomalous couplings have been ﬁtted together with a free but constrained
normalisation factor. Table 3 summarises the results for the two angular mo-
mentum states for one year of running. Like in eγ the sensitivity to κγ is
determined by the cross section measurement while λγ is given by the shape
of the events. Consequently λγ suﬀers more from the presence of pileup and
background. λγ is determined better from

nosity error Jz = 0 is more sensitive to κγ. However the luminosity can be
determined much more precise in

2.4 Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry (SUSY) is generally considered to be the best motivated ex-
tension of the Standard Model [36,37]. Therefore it will be shown in a few
examples what a photon collider can do for SUSY. Since photons couple sim-
ply to charge the cross sections can be calculated without model dependence
and the photon collider can thus be used to study decay properties of super-
symmetric particles.

As few examples of analyses with supersymmetric particles, sleptons and
charginos in the benchmark point SPS1a [38] and variants of this scenario,
have been studied. This parameter-point assumes minimal SUGRA with mass
uniﬁcation at the GUT scale and relatively light superpartners. The masses
and decay modes of the relevant superpartners are shown in table 4.

2.4.1 Slepton production in γγ collisions

In most models the ˜µR decays only into µ ˜χ0
1 so that for ˜µR-pair production
probably no information on Supersymmetry breaking parameters can be ob-
tained. Nevertheless this process has been simulated inside SPS1a [39]. The
process is mainly characterised by an acoplanar muon pair in the detector.
Below the ˜µL production threshold the main background is W-pair produc-
tion. The signal can be selected with an eﬃciency of 85% and a purity of 59%
resulting in a precision on the cross section measurement of 1.6% in a month
−1). This cross section precision can also be interpreted as
of running (100 fb
a 0.8% precision of the branching ratio BR(˜µR →
1) where it has to be as-
sumed that possible other ˜µR decays don’t give any background to the selected
channel.

In the SPS1a scenario the study of ˜µL decays is much more interesting, since

menta there are only muons from the ˜µL →

2.4.2 Chargino production in γγ collisions

A chargino can decay either into a W and a neutralino or, if kinematically al-
lowed, into a slepton and the corresponding lepton 3 . The ﬂavour composition
of the leptons is non-trivial and depends on the SUSY-breaking parameters.
Within SPS1a the ˜χ±
1 decays almost exclusively into ˜τ1ντ , so that no mean-
ingful branching ratio measurement is possible. Therefore for a simulation
study m0 has been changed to 130 GeV and tan β to 9. With these parame-
ters the ˜χ±

Because of the huge WW background an eﬃciency of 24% and a purity of 11%
is possible at √see = 600 GeV, leading to a relative branching ratio error of
3.5%. To test the usefulness of this measurement it has been injected into the
ﬁt of the low energy SUSY breaking parameters with Fittino using the masses
and cross sections from the LC/LHC study [41]. Due to the ˜χ±
1 branching ratio
measurements the precision on tan β and on the ˜τ mixing parameter improve
by a factor two to three. However up to now no decay related observables from
e+e− are used in the ﬁt.

is the partner of the right-handed electron, so that the signal is enhanced us-
ing right-handed electron beams. This polarisation suppresses simultaneously
the W-background which is present for left-handed electrons only. Also the
Z-background is reduced slightly in this case.

Signal and background have been simulated using SHERPA [26] where the

with the ˜eR decaying almost exclusively into e ˜χ0
1 [42]. With cuts in the electron
energy and polar angle an eﬃciency of ε = 71% and a purity p = 63% can
be reached allowing a 1% cross section measurement in one year of running.
As shown in [16] the selectron and neutralino mass can be obtained from
the two endpoints of the electron energy spectrum in case of monoenergetic
beams. For the simulated parameter set the neutralino mass can be measured
in e+e− running, so that one endpoint is suﬃcient to obtain the selectron
mass. Because of the sharp upper edge of photon energy spectrum the lower
endpoint is approximately preserved. The upper edge gets distorted by the
dependence of the ˜eR-energy from its polar angle but can be reconstructed
from the electron transverse momentum. It has been estimated that from the
lower endpoint the selectron mass can be measured with a precision of 0.5%.
The precision from the upper endpoint is signiﬁcantly worse.

2.5 Luminosity Measurement

As for any collider, the luminosity at a γγ and eγ collider has to be measured
using gauge reactions with a large and well known cross section. Since the
photon polarisation depends strongly on its energy, the luminosity spectrum
has to be measured separately for the diﬀerent polarisation states. A general
discussion about the luminosity measurement at γγ and eγ colliders can be
found in [43].

A QED process involving only leptons is the ideal gauge process since it
has basically no unproven physics assumptions involved. The process γγ
→
e+e−, µ+µ− has a cross section of a few pb with realistic tracking cuts for
a total γγ angular momentum of
Jz|
= 2 [43]. This allows for a luminosity
precision around 0.1% in one year of running. For Jz = 0 the cross section is
suppressed by m2/s because of helicity conservation and thus not usable for
luminosity determination.

For eγ running the situation concerning polarisation is slightly more compli-
cated. For weak processes the electron coupling depends on the electron spin
while all processes depend on the eγ angular momentum so that in principle
the luminosity for all four possible polarisation states needs to be known. On
the other hand QED conserves parity so that with a QED process only the
luminosity for a given eγ angular momentum can be measured. Fortunately
the electron and γ polarisation at high energies are quite high and the electron
polarisation can be measured with high accuracy.

3 Technical Issues

The γγ collider imposes several technical challenges [2]. The most important
one is certainly the laser system. In order to reach high conversion factors a
laser power of

(10 J/pulse) and a spot size of

(10µm) is needed.

O

O

Due to the interaction with the laser the electron beam gets signiﬁcantly
disrupted. This requires a large crossing angle between the beams. Due to these
two facts a large energy is deposited on the detector surface which potentially
result in substantial background in the detector.

Another challenge is the beam dump. Photons cannot be deﬂected, so that
the energy density at the dump is large. There will be a direct line of sight
from the dump to the interaction point so that neutrons created in the dump
can reach sensitive detectors.

Another problem is the feedback system. The disrupted beam can probably not
be used for a fast feedback, since the low energy tail is too strongly deﬂected
by the detector solenoid. A possible idea is to use low charge bunches between
the main bunches [46]. A detailed study is needed to proof that this is possible.

3.1 The Laser Cavity

The production of 10 J laser pulses with a frequency of 10 kHz is diﬃcult if
not impossible by today’s standards. But from the more than 1019 photons
(1010) are used per beam-laser interaction. This makes
in a laser pulse only
it natural to reuse a laser pulse many times. An optical ring resonator has
been proposed for this purpose [47,48,49]. For this option a conceptual design
has been developed [50], which is summarised below. The time between two

O

22

bunches at the ILC is about 3 ns, so that the total length of the cavity is
approximately 100 m

3.1.1 Power enhancement within a passive optical cavity

Inside an optical ring resonator the circulating electric ﬁeld directly after the
input coupling mirror Mc is given by a superposition of the transmitted in-
coming electric ﬁeld and a scaled replica of the circulating ﬁeld that emerged
from this coupling mirror at the previous round-trip.

On resonance the power enhancement factor Aq describes a monotonous in-
crease of power after the cavity has been ﬁlled with q pulses:

Aq = (1





Rc represents the intensity reﬂectivity of the coupling mirror and V the power
loss factor for one round-trip.

If the reﬂectivity of the coupling mirror equals the loss factor V of the cavity,
the maximum possible steady-state power enhancement factor of A∞ = 1/(1
−
V ) is obtained and all light is absorbed by the resonant cavity. This is known
as impedance matching.

On resonance no power will be reﬂected from an impedance matched cavity in
steady state. The reﬂected power can be used as an indicator for the alignment
of the cavity in an automated control system.

3.1.2 Proposed design for an optical cavity

To maintain a suﬃciently high photon density and hence a high conversion
factor, the laser pulse must be focused at the Compton conversion point
(CP). When operated at the inevitable high power level optical windows
within the cavity would imply the risk of distortion of the circulating op-
tical picosecond-pulse as a result of the non-vanishing B-integral [51,52]. The
Compton-interaction requires therefore operation of the cavity in the vacuum
of the accelerator.

Due to space limitations and to avoid vibrations any component of the optical
cavity should preferably be positioned outside the environment of the particle
detector, a few metres away from the laser focus. As a consequence of the

23

required tight optical focus and the large distance the cross section of the
laser beam at the ﬁrst mirror will increase to more than half a metre.

Compton conversion at each of the counter-propagating electron beams re-
quires two ring cavities as exempliﬁed by Fig. 14. They are interlaced without
mutual interference. Their optical paths are enclosed within the associated

respective placement in the experimental hall is also depicted (right). The laser
beams are coupled into the cavity at positions marked by the arrows. The optical
beam path is contained within the sketched pipes that preserve the vacuum. The
high power lasers itself will be located in a separate hall above the detector (not
shown). The thin lines traversing the detector represent the electron beam paths. A
slight mutual vertical tilt between the cavities permits free passage of the particle
beams. As a ruler: The detector extends 14.8 m along the electron path.

optical beam pipes which are needed to maintain the vacuum. For details see
[50]. The focusing is accomplished by means of a reﬂective beam expander
and a second, identical telescope is used for re-collimation. In addition, this
introduces a moderate beam magniﬁcation of √3 for reduction of the beam
size within the nearly collimated region of the cavity outside the detector.

The focal spot size at the CP and the inﬂuence of the ﬁnite diameter of the
mirrors were calculated numerically [50]. Total correction of the aberrations
introduced by the telescope mirrors was thereby assumed. The diameter of
the ﬁnal focusing concave mirrors determines the minimal collision angle αl
between the laser and the electron beam. It should be kept small for high yield

24

of photons. The major eﬀect in reducing the size of the mirrors is a diﬀractive
broadening of the focal spot size The increased loss due to radiative energy
that spills over the boundaries of the mirrors turned out to be much smaller.
Figure 15 shows the broadening of the focal spot due to the ﬁnal size of the
focusing mirror as a function of the radius of this mirror.

diﬀraction broadening has to be taken into account. To optimise the yield of
photons, the crossing angle αl, the mirror diameter 2 acc, the waist size wCP ,
the laser pulse energy Epulse, as well as the laser pulse duration τpulse are
all interdependent parameters. Their respective values were determined by a
numerical optimisation process using the program CAIN [9] to calculate the
yield. CAIN assumes that charged particles interact with a Gaussian optical
beam. The centre-of-mass energy was set to 500 GeV. The aperture 2 acc of the
ﬁnal focusing concave mirrors M4, M5 at distance Limage from the conversion
point CP in Fig. 16 sets an upper limit for the opening angle θcc of the laser
cone that emerges from the beam waist:

Replacing Limage by the far ﬁeld divergence angle θL originating from a Gaus-
sian beam waist w0 results in the latter equation. wcc represents the beam
radius on each of the concave mirrors. If the electron beams cross each other
in the horizontal (x
z)
plane. To allow for an opening angle of the outgoing beampipe of 14 mrad and
the ﬁnite size of the focusing quadrupole, it is assumed that the lower edge
of the laser beampipe stays away from the horizontal plane by 17 mrad. If the
quadrupole can be smaller a lower oﬀset angle is possible allowing for a slightly
smaller laser power or higher luminosity. The projection of the diﬀerent pipes
in the x
y plane at the front face of the ﬁnal quadrupole is shown in ﬁgure
17.

The crossing angle αl is thus expressed as

αl =

θL + β ,

β = 17 mrad .

This relation was encoded into CAIN via the optical Rayleigh length zR =
π w2
0/λ and the relation θL = w0/zR of Gaussian beams [53]. Instead of the
Gaussian beam waist, the numerical value for the diﬀraction broadened waist
wCP = γ wCP, Gaussian has been used for w0. In the central part of the pulse in
the diﬀraction broadened case the beam is well approximated by a diﬀraction
limited Gaussian proﬁle using the modiﬁed Rayleigh length. Fig. 18 shows the
resulting luminosity as a function of the crossing angle αl for diﬀerent mirror
sizes acc/wcc and a laser pulse duration of τL = 3.5 ps FWHM (σ = 1.5 ps).

3.1.4 Enhancement capability of the cavity

According to the results obtained in [50] all mirrors could have a diameter
of about 120 cm. In this case cutoﬀ occurs at approximately 75 % of the hy-
pothetical Gaussian beam radius (1/e2) at the ﬁnal focusing mirror which
represents the dominant aperture at which diﬀraction will occur.

4 wCP is given in the 1/e2 convention, designating the radius that is deﬁned by
a drop of the intensity to 1/e2
13.5 % of its maximum value at the beam centre.
Given in Gaussian σ its value is a factor two smaller.
5 Here zmax is deﬁned as zmax = x/(x + 1 + ξ2) consistent with the deﬁnition in [2].

3.1.5 Eﬀects of cavity misalignments

Any misalignment of a mirror position and orientation generally results in
displacement and broadening of the intra-cavity beam waist. According to
our calculations, the displacement of the beam waist remains smaller than the
Rayleigh length, i.e. the depth of the focus. This shift of the beam waist is
hence negligible.

Maintaining the power enhancement factor e.g. above 90 % of its optimum
value A∞ demands sub-nm precision for controlling the circumference. Tech-
nical solutions for such a precise length stabilisation are well-known [55]. Even
more stringent restrictions are common in interferometrical detection of grav-
itational waves. For the latter case control loops for automatic alignment have
been developed. Despite the diﬀerent operation modes, the use of bursts of
optical ps-pulses for the γγ collider and continuous-wave (cw) laser radiation
in optical interferometers for gravitational waves, the cavity for the γγ-collider
should beneﬁt from that knowledge. In addition, adaptive optics appears to
be essential for operation of such a cavity for the photon collider. It helps
substantially to endure the development of a diﬀraction limited optical mode
despite the expected thermal distortion due to absorption of a tiny fraction
of the circulating optical power within optical coatings and the substrates of
the cavity mirrors.

3.2 Detector and Backgrounds

Machine backgrounds at a linear collider are mainly coming from beam-beam
eﬀects in the interaction region [56]. There are several diﬀerences between an
e+e− and a γγ collider: The electron beam gets disrupted in the electron-laser
interaction with a disruption angle around 10 mrad. This precludes head on
collision since the outgoing beam does no longer ﬁt through the aperture of the
ﬁnal focusing quadrupole. The beam radius increases further due to the angle
between the outgoing beam and the magnetic ﬁeld of the detector solenoid.
Figure 19 shows the angular spread of the outgoing electron beam directly

29

behind the interaction point and and at z = 2.8 m. To limit the energy loss in
the detector an opening angle of 14 mrad for the outgoing beampipe has been
chosen. A crossing angle of 34 mrad had been adapted, as suggested in [2]. The
front face of the ﬁnal quadrupole is assumed to be l∗ = 3.8 m away from the
interaction point. With recent designs of small superconducting quadrupoles
[10] this crossing angle or even a slightly smaller one should be possible.

For simplicity, the detector is assumed to be identical to the e+e− detector
described in [56] above polar angles of θ = 7◦. Below this angle it has to be
modiﬁed to accommodate the γγ speciﬁc equipment. The tracking system of
the detector is shown in ﬁgure 20.

Detailed backgrounds have been simulated using CAIN [9]. For these simu-
lations the incoherent particle-particle as well as the coherent particle-beam

30

interactions have been considered. The direct background at large angle is
exclusively coming from incoherent e+e− pair creation. This background is
signiﬁcantly smaller than in the e+e− version of TESLA [56]. Another signif-
icant amount of background is coming from backscattering of particles. This
background is potentially larger than in e+e− for several reasons. Because of
the crossing angle the particles already hit the detector at a larger radius than
in e+e−. Also because of the crossing angles the beams are not parallel to the
solenoid, so that low momentum particles get swept out of the beampipe by
the magnetic ﬁeld. Low energy electrons of one bunch get deﬂected by the
negative charge of the opposing bunch, while they are focused by the oppo-
site charge in e+e−. Some electrons get deﬂected enough by the electron-laser
interaction that they hit the detector or the inner side of the beampipe close
to the detector.

Figure 21 shows the energy weighted angular distribution of particles and
the energy distribution at z = 2.8 m, the front-face of the electromagnetic
calorimeter. In total 40 TeV per bunch crossing are deposited on the front
face of the mask from pair production at the IP. This is roughly the same
energy as for the e+e− option described in [56]. Because of the large crossing
angle, however, the backscattered particles are more diﬃcult to capture by the
masking system. There is also a danger that several hundred TeV of electrons
hit the mask very close to the exit whole. These electrons stem from multiple
interactions with the laser beam. They have a signiﬁcantly larger energy than
the pairs and contribute thus much less to the backscattering. If needed these
particles can be suppressed by making the beampipe in the horizontal plane
slightly larger.

The inner part of the detector had to be completely redesigned to house the
pipes for the beam and the laser. To avoid scattering surfaces inside the de-
tector the beampipe is identical to the e+e− case up to z = 17 cm followed by
a conical part with opening angle 93 mrad up to z =

2.825 m.

±

Only behind the front-face of the calorimeter the common beampipe splits into
individual ones for the incoming and outgoing beams and lasers. To absorb
backscattered particles the pipes are surrounded by a tungsten mask with
pointing geometry and at thickness of 5 cm at z = 2.8 m.

Another mask of 5 cm thickness is put inside the beampipe where the space
needed for the laser is left free. Since the background is not symmetric in
the azimuthal angle the function of the mask is not deteriorated by this. The
outer mask starts at z=23 cm to protect as much as possible of the detector,
the inner mask starts at z=1 m because otherwise it receives too many direct
hits from background particles created at the interaction point. The photon
background in the TPC as a function of the z-coordinate where the photon
enters the TPC is shown in ﬁg. 22 with and without the inner mask. It is
evident that the inner mask is needed to protect the TPC.

Figure 24 shows the background in the vertex detector separated into direct
hits and hits from backscattering. The total number of hits in the diﬀerent lay-

the innermost layer of the vertex detector cannot be protected by the mask
so that it receives a signiﬁcant amount of backscattering. The background
shown in ﬁgure 24 is only from incoherent processes at the interaction point.
In addition a background of two times around 15 hits per bunch crossing and
layer is present from low energy γγ
q¯q events, explained in section 2.1, and
from backscattering from showers induced by electrons that loose exception-
ally much energy in the interaction with the laser or by beamstrahlung. The
latter process is very rare, but consist of relatively large showers, so that the
ﬂuctuations are large.

3.3 The Beamdump

Since photons cannot be deﬂected there has to be a direct line of sight from
the interaction point to the beam dump. The standard ILC design uses a
water dump at a distance of about 100 m from the detector. Such a dump has
been simulated with Geant4 [59] using the physics list QGSP HP and a cross
section bias of 100. Cross checks have been done with LHEP GN, QGSP GN,
and a cross section bias of one and consistent results have been found. For
a neutron kinetic energy of En > 15 keV about 3.5 neutrons/BX/cm2 have
1011
been found with this setup from the γ-beam only, corresponding to 5
neutrons/cm2/year. If the electron beam will be dumped in the same beam
dump this number has to be doubled. Such a neutron ﬂux will be a problem
for a CCD vertex detector. Some ideas how to reduce the neutron ﬂux exist
[60], but there is no detailed design yet.

·

Another problem for the dump is the high energy density of the photon beam
which would heat the water in the dump locally too much. Some ideas how to
avoid this are also presented in [60].

4 Conclusions

Depending on the physics scenario, nature has chosen, a photon collider is
an interesting complement to the e+e− baseline version of the ILC. The ﬁnal

34

decision if a photon collider will be built, should only be taken when supporting
results from LHC and e+e− running of the ILC are available.

From the technical side the greatest challenge is probably the laser system.
A conceptual design for a resonant laser cavity has been shown which could
reach a power enhancement factor around 100 and thus reduce the required
laser power to an acceptable level.

The detector at a photon collider seems manageable. The region below a polar
angle of 7◦ is completely taken by pipes and the masking system, but at larger
angles a detector similar to e+e− can provide comparable performance.

Recent results of an aging test performed at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility on a single–gap RPC
prototype developed for the LHCb Muon System are presented. The results are based on an accumulated charge
2
of about 0.45 C/cm
, corresponding to about 4 years of LHCb running at the highest background rate. The
performance of the chamber has been studied under several photon ﬂux values exploiting a muon beam. A
degradation of the rate capability above 1 kHz/cm
is observed, which can be correlated to a sizeable increase
of resistivity of the chamber plates. An increase of the chamber dark current is also observed. The chamber
performance is found to fulﬁll the LHCb operation requirements.

1. Introduction

Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) detectors have
been adopted by the LHCb Collaboration to cover
a large fraction (about 48%) of the Muon Sys-
tem [1,2]. The LHCb experiment [3] covers the
forward part of the solid angle and is therefore
subject to a very large particle ﬂux. In particu-
lar, the particle rates expected in the Muon Sys-
tem are signiﬁcantly larger than those expected
by ATLAS [4] and CMS experiments [5]. In the
regions covered by RPCs, the maximum particle
rate is expected to vary between 0.25 and 0.75
kHz/cm2, depending mainly on the polar angle.
These large rates are potentially dangerous from
the point of view of the RPC aging, which must
be carefully studied and evaluated.

The main aging eﬀect for RPCs is produced by
the current ﬂowing through the resistive plates;
It has been demonstrated, indeed, that the irra-
diation of bakelite slabs with photons up to an
integrated dose of 20 kGy does not produce any
degradation in the bakelite properties [6]. The
most important parameter to evaluate the aging
eﬀects is given therefore by the total charge ﬂow

accross the detector during its lifetime . Assum-
ing an average avalanche charge of 30 pC [6], the
total charge integrated by LHCb RPCs over 10
years of operation range from 0.35 C/cm2, in the
regions of the Muon System where the particle
ﬂux is smaller, to about 1.1 C/cm2 in the high
rate regions.

Aging tests performed by the RPC groups of
ATLAS and CMS have shown that their detec-
tors can withstand the radiation doses expected
in those experiments. However, these tests are
based on an integrated charge of at most 0.3
C/cm2 [7,8] which is four times smaller than the
maximum expected in LHCb RPCs.

To cope with the LHCb requirements, an ex-
tensive aging programme has been devised, which
started in January 2001 and is expected to last,
at a ﬁrst stage, until December 2001, exploit-
ing the large CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility
(GIF) [9], where a 137Cs gamma source of about
655 GBq is available.

2. Setup of the aging test

The aging test consists in irradiating for about
one year a single gap RPC (irradiated RPC) at

the GIF facility. The position closest to the
source available for the chamber is at about 1
meter, where the photon ﬂux is, roughly, 1.5
kHz/cm2. Another chamber (reference RPC) is
installed just outside the irradiation area. Both
chambers share the same gas and high voltage
lines so that they are operated in the same con-
ditions. In this way it is possible to disentangle
the eﬀects due to variations in the environment
parameters, such as temperature, pressure or gas
quality, from those due to the irradiation.

RPCs are operated with a gas mixture consist-
ing of 95% C2H2F4, 4% iC4H10, 1% SF6. To
simulate the LHCb conditions and perform the
test in a reasonable amount of time, the applied
voltage was chosen in such a way to have an av-
erage avalanche charge of about 50 pC, that, at
the rate quoted above, yields a current density
of about 80 nA/cm2. This, with a realistic duty
factor of 30%, gives an integrated charge of about
0.8 C/cm2 in one year of irradiation, which corre-
sponds to about 7 LHCb years in the worst back-
ground conditions.

Integrated currents versus time from

The two RPCs prepared for the aging test have
resistive plates made of phenolic bakelite with re-
sistivity ρ = 9 · 109 Ω cm. The plates are oiled
with linseed oil. The size of both chambers is
50x50 cm2. The readout strips of the irradiated
RPC are 3 cm wide and have been cut in two
along their length, so that the ﬁnal strip area
is 3x25 cm2. The strips of the reference cham-
ber, instead, are 3 cm wide and 50 cm long. The

All the relevant parameters of the test, temper-
ature, pressure, high voltage and currents drawn
by the chambers, are continuously monitored and
recorded on a PC. In Figure 1 the current drawn
by the irradiated RPC is shown as a function of
time (top plot) along with the temperature (mid-
dle plot). In the bottom plot the current drawn
by the reference RPC is also shown. The latter
is reasonably stable and constant over the whole
aging test, showing that the chambers have been

3

operated rather smoothly and no large systematic
eﬀects are expected to aﬀect the performance of
the two RPCs. In Figure 2, the integrated charge
as a function of time is shown. The irradiated
RPC has accumulated about 0.45 C/cm2 corre-
sponding to about 4 LHCb years in the regions
with the highest background rate and to more
than 10 LHCb years in the low background re-
gions.

To check the performance of the irradiated
chamber at this intermediate aging stage, a beam
test was performed, using the muon beam avail-
able at the GIF. In the next sections the results
of this test will be described.

of the gas and high voltage supplies. The cham-
ber eﬃciency was evaluated by tracking the beam
particles with a scintillator hodoscope and with
an additional small 10×10 cm2 RPC. The photon
ﬂuxes were estimated from the chamber counting
rates measured during dedicated oﬀ-spill gates.
The measurements described in the next sections
were obtained at three diﬀerent source attenua-
tion values, namely attenuation 1, 2 and 5 cor-
responding roughly to 1 kHz/cm2, 0.7 kHz/cm2
and 0.4 kHz/cm2 photon ﬂuxes respectively.

3.1. Analysis of currents

The current drawn by the irradiated chamber
with the source on, was found to be about a factor
of two smaller than that of the reference RPC as
can be seen from Figure 4.

3. Beam test results

The irradiated and the reference RPCs have
been carefully tested exploiting the muon beam
available at the GIF. The test setup is sketched in
Figure 3. The combined use of the gamma source
and the beam allows a test of the chamber per-
formance parameters, like eﬃciency, cluster size
and rate capability, under diﬀerent photon ﬂuxes,
ranging from zero (source oﬀ) up to a maximum
that, in this test setup, was about 1 kHz/cm2.
The chambers were operated in the same condi-
tions as in the aging test from the point of view

This eﬀect can be interpreted within a model
introduced in [10]. In this simple model one as-

working point is determined by an eﬀective volt-

this framework, quantities such as the average
avalanche charge Qγ or the chamber eﬃciency ε
are only functions of the gas properties and of
Vgas. This means that once the correct value of
the resistance R has been determined, the func-
tions ε(Vgas) and Qγ(Vgas) must be universal
functions independent on the particle ﬂux and on
the plate characteristics. This method allows a
non destructive estimation of the plate resistivity,
that can be monitored on–line during the aging
test.

Qγ is measured by normalising the current
drawn by the chambers to the rate of converted
photons, which can be obtained from the chamber
counting rate at the plateau, corrected for the ef-
ﬁciency. The measured counting rates are plotted
in Figure 5.

The distributions of Qγ for the two RPCs, at
diﬀerent photon ﬂuxes, are plotted as a func-
tion of Vgas in Figure 6; they are fairly consis-
tent with a single curve. The resulting values of
the plate resistance, for the irradiated and the

reference RPCs are Rirr = 23.1MΩ and Rref =
6.6MΩ respectively corresponding to equivalent
bakelite resistivities ρirr = 1.4 × 1011Ωcm and
ρref = 4.1 × 1010Ωcm. Compared to the original
resistivity value and to the reference chamber, a
large increase in the plate resistivity for the irradi-
ated RPC can be observed, which can be ascribed
to the radiation eﬀect and that accounts for the
current drop mentioned above.

The eﬃciencies of the two RPCs are plotted as
a function of Vgas in Figure 7. Again, the curves
are consistent with an universal function ε(Vgas).

3.2. Eﬃciencies and rate capabilities

Because of the stringent requirements imposed
by the LHCb muon trigger [1], the RPCs are re-
quired to have an eﬃciency above 95% up to the
maximum expected background rate.
In order
to test the ability of the irradiated RPC to work
within the LHCb operational parameters, the rate
capability of the two RPCs has been carefully
tested. In Figure 8 the RPC eﬃciency as a func-
tion of the photon ﬂux for three diﬀerent high
voltage values is shown. The eﬃciency values are

normalised to those obtained with the source oﬀ.
At the nominal applied voltage of 10.2 kV, the
eﬃciency exceeds 95% for both chambers up to a
photon ﬂux of about 0.8 kHz/cm2. However, as
soon as the high voltage is raised by a few hun-
dreds volts, the RPCs recover their full eﬃciency
up to a ﬂux of more than 1 kHz/cm2. Moreover
there is no evidence of a diﬀerent behaviour be-
tween the irradiated and the reference RPC. From
this test it is possible to conclude that the RPCs
under test can be safely operated, from the aging
point of view, at least for 4 LHCb years in the
worst expected background conditions.

3.3. Dark currents

In the design of RPCs for LHCb, the level of
dark currents drawn by the chambers is of con-
cern, especially from the aging point of view. The
dark currents will contribute an aging eﬀect that
must be kept well below the aging caused by the
particle ﬂux. Considering as acceptable an extra-
aging of 25%, the dark current density must be
kept below 3 nA/cm2, over the experiment life-
time.

To check if these constraints are fulﬁlled, the
behaviour of the dark currents of the chambers
under test has been studied. In Figure 9 the dark
currents drawn by the two RPCs as a function of
the applied voltage, measured at diﬀerent inter-
mediate times during the aging test are shown. A
large increase of the dark current drawn by the ir-
radiated RPC can be clearly observed. The eﬀect
of the irradiation amounts to about 2 nA/cm2.
This behaviour is still under investigation and no
interpretation can be worked out yet. Anyhow, it
is worth to stress that the dark current observed
in the irradiated chamber is still below the max-
imum allowed value for the LHCb Muon System.

4. Summary and conclusions

The results of an aging test of an RPC pro-
totype for the LHCb muon system have been de-
scribed. The irradiated prototype has been tested
with a muon beam at the GIF after a charge of
0.45 C/cm2 has been integrated, corresponding

The performance of the irradiated RPC has been
compared to that of a reference chamber. As
an eﬀect of the irradiation, a large increase of
the resistivity of the chamber plates in the irra-
diated RPC has been observed; a clear increase
of the dark current is also observed. The irradi-
ated RPC prototype is still well eﬃcient up to the
maximum rate expected in the LHCb muon sys-
tem and the dark current level is under control.

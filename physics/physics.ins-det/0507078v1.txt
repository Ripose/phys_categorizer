Abstract

Hard photons well above 100 GeV have to be generated in a future photon-collider
which essentially will be based on the infrastructure of the planned International
Linear Collider (ILC). The energy of near-infrared laser photons will be boosted by
Compton backscattering against a high energy relativistic electron beam. For high
eﬀectiveness, a very powerful lasersystem is required that exceeds todays state-of-
the-art capabilities. In this paper a design of an auxiliary passive cavity is discussed
that resonantly enhances the peak-power of the laser. The properties and prospects
of such a cavity are addressed on the basis of the speciﬁcations for the European
TeV Energy Superconducting Linear Accelerator (TESLA) proposal. Those of the
ILC are expected to be similar.

1 Introduction

There is a worldwide consensus that the next particle physics project is a lin-
ear accelerator for positron-electron (e+e−) collisions in the energy range of
1 TeV[1]. In Summer of 2004 the International Committee for
500 GeV to

Future Accelerators (ICFA) recommended to the International Linear Collider
Steering Committee (ILCSC) an accelerator based on superconducting radio
frequency resonators for setting up the International Linear Collider (ILC)
[2]. Such a technology has been developed by the TESLA (TeV Energy Super-
conducting Linear Accelerator) collaboration. Besides collisions between e+e−,
a second interaction point (IP) for collisions between photons as well as colli-
sions of electrons on photons is foreseen. This second IP is commonly referred
to as the Gamma-Gamma (γγ) Collider arm of a linear collider. In this paper
we will continue to use the parameter of the superconducting TESLA machine
[3], as the parameters of the ILC are expected to be similar.

2 Creation and collision of high energy photons

In a photon collider two opposing pulsed electron beams of E0 = 250 GeV
energy travel towards the interaction point (IP). According to the architecture
of the TESLA design each of them collides a few mm before the IP with a
tightly focused laser beam. Its diameter is of the order of a few 10 µm, which
will be much larger than the elliptical cross section of the electron bunch size.
The latter exhibits 88 nm and 4.3 nm in its two perpendicular half axes for
TESLA [4]. The laser photons (
1 eV) are backscattered as outlined in Fig. 1.
Compton scattering raises their energy close to that of the initial electrons.

polarized, γ beams in the range of several hundred GeV with low background
[4,5,6,7]. At the IP they collide with a similar opposite γ or electron beam. The
photon spot size at the IP will then be almost equal to that of the electrons
at the IP. Therefore the total luminosity of γγ, γe− collisions will be similar
to that of the basic e−e− beams.

E0, ~ω0 and λ denote the electron beam energy, photon energy and wavelength
of the laser. α represents the crossing angle between laser and electron beam.
It is desirable to keep x below 4.8, since for larger x the high energy photons
are lost by e+e− pair production due to their interaction with the laser beam
[8]. For the TESLA beam parameters a wavelength near λ = 1 µm coinciding
4.75 and
with powerful solid state lasers appears to be promising [4]. Then x

The time structure of the laser system must match the bunch structure of
the accelerator with 2820 bunches per train, each of 2.4 ps FWHM (σ = 1 ps)
duration for TESLA. The bunches are 337 ns apart and have a 5 Hz repeti-
tion rate [3,4]. Pulses of several Joule are required to scatter the majority of
electrons. The precise energy of each pulse depends strongly on the degree of
focusing the optical onto the electron beam, as well as on the crossing angle
α in respect to the electrons. A Nd:YLF-based laser architecture generating
this special time structure and providing a ﬂat and stable train of ultraviolet
(UV) synchronized ps pulses over 0.8 ms long time periods is already in use
for some time at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF)[9,10]. At a wavelength of
1047 nm it delivers 200 µJ per pulse to the nonlinear crystals for conversion
into the UV. At present, a maximum single pulse energy in excess of 300 µJ
for bursts containing 800 pulses at 1 MHz repetition rate, corresponding to
30 MW peak-power is generated in the infrared. For bursts of 2400 pulses this
reduces to 140 µJ per pulse at 3 MHz repetition rate within the pulse train
[10]. This system produces an average power between one and two watts. On
the other hand, current solid-state laser technology is clearly in the position
of generating short pulses at the 5 TW peak-power level. In the foreseeable fu-
ture however, the required high average power for a photon collider of several
ten kilowatt and diﬀraction limited pulses can not be produced directly with
the output from a laser [11,12].

According to the TESLA machine parameters [4] each bunch contains 2
1019
electrons, whereas a 5 J Laser pulse at λ = 1064 nm consists of 2.5
photons. Provided that all electrons within the bunch undergo scattering,
only one in 109 photons is lost during a single laser-electron collision. Thus, it
has been proposed to reuse the remaining laser pulse by storing it in a passive
resonant optical cavity [13,14,15]. This results in a signiﬁcant reduction of the
required single pulse energy to be delivered by the laser. The time structure
of the electron bunches as planned for TESLA is particularly well suited for
application of such a cavity. Its round-trip time has to be adapted to the
bunch-spacing of 337 ns resulting in a circumference U of about 100 m. As will
be shown, this is suﬃcient for wrapping the optical cavity around the particle
detector.

3 Existing applications of passive optical cavities

Passive build-up cavities for generating a region of enhanced intensity are rou-
tinely used in combination with both continuous wave (cw) and mode-locked
sources in a number of laser-related experiments such as frequency doubling
[16,17,18,19] (cw-laser), [20,21,22] (mode-locked laser), high-resolution spec-
troscopy [23,24,25,26,27], high sensitive detection of absorption [28,29,30,31]
or cavity ring-down absorption spectroscopy [32]. For the latter, linear cavities
for micro-pulse energy enhancement in the mid-infrared region at 5.3 µm have
been investigated at the Stanford free-electron laser [33,34].

A recent application is the ampliﬁcation of ultrashort light pulses through
phase coherent superposition of successive pulses from a mode-locked pulse
train in a high-ﬁnesse optical cavity and subsequent cavity dumping [35,36,37].
An ampliﬁcation factor in the order of 10 has been obtained.

For optical interferometric detection of gravitational waves a 2000-fold power
recycling cavity for the GEO600-project, one of several current ﬁrst-generation
large-scale interferometers, is speciﬁed to develop a cw light power of approx-
imately 10 kW within the interferometer [38]. Recently, a power enhancement
of
300 has already been obtained with 1 W input from the mode cleaner
cavities [39,40].

Laser increasingly enter also the ﬁeld of high energy physics for monitoring the
transverse size of electron beams (“laser wire”)[41,42,43,44,45,46], as well as
for precision measurement of electron beam polarization [47,48,49]. Both are
based on Compton scattering of low energy photons around 1 eV. The ”laser
wire” technique relies on an optical cavity for boosting the laser power.

Most of the current cavities for the purpose of frequency doubling have a ring

4

conﬁguration, providing optical isolation from the laser cavity. This advan-
tage has been pointed out in [50]. The ring conﬁguration is also the preferred
geometry for an optical cavity for the photon collider.

Some non-resonant storage rings have been demonstrated in which the energy
of a laser pulse that was lost through scattering, diﬀraction at the mirrors
and upon impact with the electron beam is partially replaced by an ampliﬁer
[51,52]. In these cases, the round-trip time of the optical pulse is less than the
intervals of the laser pulses. These storage rings operate well below the power
density required for the γγ-collider.

If the reﬂectivity of the coupling mirror equals a given loss factor V , the

(Rc := V ) in analogy to properties of electrical cables and waveguides. In Fig. 2

The duration for which a laser pulse will be stored within the cavity is given

4.1 Reﬂected Power from the Cavity

Similar to Eq. (2), the electric ﬁeld of the wave that is reﬂected from the
coupling mirror Mc is the coherent superposition of a directly reﬂected wave
from the laser rc Ein and transmission of the intra-cavity ﬁeld through the
coupling mirror. When q pulses had already been injected, the circulating
ﬁeld just before Mc is the intra-cavity ﬁeld reﬂected from this mirror after

5 Constraints due to the particle detector and design proposal for

an optical cavity

The Compton-interaction requires operation of the cavity in the Ultra High
Vacuum (UHV) of the accelerator. When operated at the inevitable high power
level optical windows within the cavity would imply the risk of distortion
of the circulating optical ps-pulse as a result of the non-vanishing B-integral
[54,55]. For maintaining a suﬃcient high γ ﬂux density and hence a luminosity
of around 1034 cm−2 s−1, the laser pulse must be focused at the Compton
conversion point (CP).

The particle detector for the γγ-option is expected to be almost identical to
the one for e+e−-physics located at the leptonic IP. For TESLA, the path
length between its end face and the focus of both optical cavities amounts
to about 7.40 m [56]. The end faces extend over 7.45 m and are perpendicu-
lar to the beam axis. As a consequence of the required tight optical focus, a
widespread beam diameter of more than half a meter will emerge from the
detector end-faces. Due to shortage of space any optics for the optical cav-
ity should preferably be positioned outside the environment of the particle
detector.

These demands suggest to employ two symmetrical telescopic ring cavities,
required for Compton conversion at each of the counter-propagating electron
beams, and to interlace them without mutual interference. Fig. 3 depicts an
aerial view on two possible spatial embeddings of these cavities. Their optical
paths are enclosed within the associated optical beam pipes which are needed
for maintaining the vacuum. In the upper sketch each ring resonator stretches
across a plane. Both planes enclose an angle of 90◦ degrees. This tipping allows
an un-obstructed passage of both electron beams directions. In addition, a
small tilt angle of approx. +1.58◦ and
1.58◦, respec., in the vertical direction
−
prevents the mirrors of the ﬁnal focusing optics being to close to the leptonic
beams. The two laser beams originate from a separate hall placed directly
above the detector. They are pointing in opposing directions with the same
vertical tilt for coupling into their respective cavities on top of the detector.
For the lower design, the optical beam pathes outside the detector are kept in
two adjacent parallel planes. They cross each other in the interaction region
within the detector.

Fig. 4 describes the optical conﬁguration of an individual cavity. A telescopic
convex-concave mirror arrangement generates a focus in the interaction re-
gion and a second, identical telescope re-collimates it again. In addition, they
introduce a moderate beam magniﬁcation that reduces the beam size within
the nearly collimated region of the cavity outside the detector. Here the laser
is coupled to the cavity via M7 or M8.

coupled into the cavity at positions marked by the arrows. The optical beam path
is contained within the sketched pipes that preserve the vacuum. The high power
lasers itself will be located in a separate hall above the detector (not shown). The
thin lines traversing the detector represent the electron beam paths. A slight mutual
vertical tilt between the cavities permits free passage of the particle beams. As a
ruler: The detector extends 14.8 m along the electron path.

6 Telescopic cavity

Disregarding the ﬁnal size of the mirrors the focal spot size at CP is deter-
mined by the Gaussian eigenmode within this cavity. That is calculated by
setting up the round-trip matrix ((Mccw)), [57]. We assume total correction
of the aberrations of the telescope mirrors. When starting at a reference plane
containing CP and proceeding in counter clockwise direction, one obtains for
the proposed cavity the following dependence on the geometrical data:

The diameter of the ﬁnal focusing concave mirrors determine the minimal col-
lision angle α between laser and electron beam. They should be kept small for
high yield of γ. This however gives rise to an additional contribution LFdif f
to the total loss factor V of the cavity due to diﬀractive power loss, to a
diﬀraction broadening of the focal spot size wCP, Gaussian and to deviations
from the Gaussian mode. These were studied numerically using the physical
optics code GLAD [59]. A Gaussian beam was injected into a cavity formed
by perfect reﬂecting mirrors and was numerically propagated according the
Fox-Li approach [60] throughout many revolutions, until a stationary ﬁeld
distribution was established. Then the beam size wCP at the focus was calcu-
lated by the second moment of the electric ﬁeld distribution. LFdif f resulted
from the fractional drop of power during one round-trip.

By reducing the size of the concave mirrors, the beam size wcc on these mirrors
also decreases, minimizing the optical power that is lost. This requires a growth
of the beam waist at the CP. The relative broadening γCP := wCP /wCP, Gaussian
of the focal spot size compared to the Gaussian focal beam radius is plotted
in Fig. 5 as a function of a normalized radius acc/wcc, Gaussian of the concave
mirrors. It is expressed in units of the corresponding Gaussian beam radius
at this location. This plot is characteristic for the layout of an optical cavity
following Fig. 4 For reasons of self-resemblance the diﬀractive broadening be-
haves similar when the size of the focus within the cavity of Fig. 4 is varied by
shifting both telescopes either an equal amount towards (reduction) or away

As shown later the diﬀraction loss LFdif f turns out to be negligible for pa-

by limiting the aperture 2 acc of the ﬁnal focusing concave mirrors. Both concave
mirrors are assumed to have the same size. wcc, Gaussian represents the Gaussian

mirrors. wCP is the corresponding radius for ﬁnite aperture.

7 Laser-electron crossing angle

In order to calculate the laser-electron crossing angle α and to specify wCP ,
diﬀraction broadening has to be taken into account. In respect to a high yield
of γ, crossing angle α, mirror diameter 2 acc, waist size wCP , laser pulse energy
Epulse, as well as laser pulse duration τpulse are all interdependent parameters.
Their respective values were determined by a numerical optimization process
using the CAIN Monte Carlo code [61,62,63] which assumes charged particles
interact with a Gaussian optical beam. The center-of-mass energy was set to
500 GeV. The aperture 2 acc of the ﬁnal focusing concave mirrors M4, M5 at
distance Limage from the conversion point CP in Fig. (4) sets an upper limit
for the opening angle θcc of the laser cone that emerges from the beam waist:

θcc =

acc
Limage

(20)

Replacing Limage by the far ﬁeld divergence angle θL originating from a Gaus-
sian beam waist w0 results in the latter equation. wcc represents the beam
radius on each of the concave mirrors. For the TESLA parameters, an addi-
tional oﬀset angle β of 17 mrad occurs in view of the disruption of the electron
beam during the Compton scattering and the physical size of the electron
beam pipes near the interaction region. The crossing angle α is thus expressed

the Gaussian beam waist, the numerical value for the diﬀraction broadened
waist wCP = γ wCP, Gaussian has been used for w0. Fig. 6 shows the resulting lu-
minosity as a function of the crossing angle α for diﬀerent mirror sizes acc/wcc

range the luminosity rises with decreasing diameter of the mirrors. A value
of acc/wcc = 0.75 is therefore selected. An acceptable crossing angle is then

≈
42.7 cm. This leaves suﬃcient room for the wings
numerical modelling to
of the electric ﬁeld distribution as will be seen in the discussion of diﬀraction
loss. The concave mirror should therefore have a diameter of about 120 cm.
This yields a f-number f# = 12.7 for both focussing telescopes.

≈

·

In this way the concave mirror is designed to represent the dominant aperture
at which diﬀraction will occur. The telescope reduces the lateral extension of
the mode by a factor of √3. However, a reduction of all other mirrors by this
factor √3 is not advisable without introducing further signiﬁcant apertures.
These would inﬂuence the beam size even further and create losses which in
the end would reduce the eﬃciency of the Compton conversion. Therefore, all
mirrors should have the same diameter of 120 cm.

A plot of the numerically obtained stationary diﬀraction loss factor LFdif f as
a function of the diﬀraction broadened beam waist wCP is shown in Fig. 7. It
results from slight variations of the distance L1 between both telescopes. At
the same time L2 has been adjusted in the opposite direction, in order to keep
the total path length unchanged. The diameter of all mirrors was thereby

RHR = 99.99 % and 99.95 % would permit a steady-state impedance matched
power enhancement between 1100 and 270, for otherwise perfect conditions.
The enhancement becomes the more sensitive against any impedance mis-
match, the larger the amount of A is. In practice, one probably will have a
set of spare mirrors with slightly varying reﬂectivity and check which one will
give the best enhancement.

Before onset of each electron bunch train nκ, prepulse additional laser pulses are
required for the accumulation of a suﬃcient large optical pulse energy within
the cavity, that will ensure an enhancement of at least the fraction κ (κ < 1)
of the stationary amount Amax. The number nκ, prepulse is dervied from Eq. (4)

As an example, the build-up of power obtained from the numerical propagation
of an optical pulse under Gaussian seed-conditions through many revolutions
is represented by Fig. 8 for Rc = 99 %, V = 0.9998, and RHR = 100 %. At perfect
resonance 1034 pre-pulses are then expected for obtaining an enhancement of
at least 99 % of Amax = 383, or A = 378.8. The stationary enhancement of 353
in Fig. 8 following in accordance with Eq. (22) after
1000 circulations of the
pulse reﬂects a 92 % coupling of the injected Gaussian mode into the cavity
mode. The number of laser pre-pulses for reaching an approximate steady-
state declines as the impedance matching condition is violated.

When A represents the power enhancement factor of the optical cavity, the
required average power of the laser is reduced to A/(1+nprepulse/ntrain), where
ntrain is the number of electron bunches in one train.

9 Damage threshold

The TELSA bunch structure consists of bunch trains of 2820 bunches with
about 300 ns bunch spacing and a train repetition rate of 5 Hz. This pulse
structure represents an intermediate regime between two identiﬁed damage
mechanisms [66]. For a pulse duration above 100 ps the damage occurs by
melting due to heat deposition, whereas for less than 20 ps the damage site
is limited to the region where the intensity is suﬃcient for a laser generated
plasma. This occurs before a signiﬁcant transfer of energy from the electrons
to the lattice has taken place.

≈

For
3.5 ps (FWHM) pulse duration the threshold for 600 shots at 10 Hz
repetition rate and 1053 nm wavelength of uncoated very uniform fused silica
5 mJ/cm2 per pulse
samples is of the order of 2 J/cm2 [67], whereas just
results from the parameter for the cavity.

≈

For a rough estimation of the worst case risk for material damage the cumu-
lative eﬀect of all pulses within the train is assumed to be represented by a
single pulse with total energy and duration equivalent to that of all optical
bunches within a train. The parameters of Tab. 1, 2 result then in a laser en-
ergy ﬂuence of around 4 J/cm2 within 10 ns at the mirrors of the cavity for a
hypothetical Gaussian beam and 13 J/cm2 for the cavity mode with truncated
mirrors. At the ﬁnal focussing concave mirrors this ﬂuence is lower by a factor
of 3 due to the beam expansion. According [66] the laser damage threshold for
10 ns pulse duration for various materials including fused silica and coatings
is higher and lies around 50 J/cm2 for the substrat, and above approximately
44 J/cm2 to 120 J/cm2 for the mirrors depending on the composition of the
multilayer coatings. Following the known scaling laws summarized e.g. in [66],
for a wavelength around 1 µm a further factor of (1 ms/10 ns)0.4 = 100 for the
increase of the threshold for the contribution due to thermal induced damage
could probably be anticipated for distribution of the optical bunches within a
train of

1 ms duration as in the TESLA time structure.

≈

This means that the expected ﬂuence is below the damage threshold. However,
no data for trains of ps-pulses separated on nano- to microsecond time scales
which accumulate to the stated ﬂuences are known to us. For a ﬁnal judgment
an experimental study with a representative of the ILC bunch structure would
be required.

10 Eﬀects of cavity misalignments

From Eq. (7) the maximum acceptable length detuning δκ for the circumfer-
ence of the optical cavity for a tolerated fractional decline κ in the power
enhancement factor Amax from the resonance condition is derived to be given
by

(23)

Maintaining the power enhancement factor e.g. above κ = 90 % of its opti-
mum value Amax demands a match of the circumference of the cavity of better
0.57 nm for an assumed value Amax of 100. Technical solutions for such a pre-
cise length stabilization are well-known [68]. Even more stringent restrictions
are common in interferometrical detection of gravitational waves.

Any misalignment generally results in displacement and broadening of the
intra-cavity beam waist. Mechanical vibrations due to instrumentation in the
environment of the particle detector, seismic ground motion as well as slight
deviations during assembly might slightly modify position and tilt of the mir-
rors. According to our calculations, the displacement of the beam waist re-
mains smaller then the Rayleigh length, i.e. the depth of the focus. This shift
of the beam waist is hence negligible.

Broadening of the waist modiﬁes the cavity-mode and reduces the mode cou-
pling between laser and cavity. The resulting relative decline of the power
enhancement factor Amax was found to be largely independent of the ﬁnesse
of the cavity. As an example two identical cavities with enhancement factors
of 353 and 76, respectively, were considered. Fig. 9 shows the eﬀect of shifting
one telescope over a range of up to 1 cm from its designated location away
from the waist. Its internal alignment was assumed as being preserved. Re-
garding this vast variation range compared to the Rayleigh length in Tab. 2,
the decline for sub-mm shifts is rather modest. It remains below 20 %. At a
shift of 1 cm reduces the enhancement to 40 % of Amax. A decline of similar
amount occurs e.g. for a deviation of the focal length fx of the convex mirror
of 12 mm.

An increase of the focal length fx or shift of the telescope away from CP (the
location of the beam waist) is accompanied by an increase of the radius of the
beam waist. The latter is depicted by Fig. 10. Under the inﬂuence of clipping
at the concave mirrors the growth of the diﬀraction broadened beam size
is considerably lower. This allows to shift the operating point of the cavity
further away from the stability limit. A zero waist size denotes an instable
optical cavity.

enhancement for two diﬀerent values of the coupling reﬂectivity RC and a mirror
size adapted according acc/wcc, Gaussian = 0.75. A cavity loss factor V = 0.99938
was arbitrarily assumed. Then the coupling reﬂectivities Rc = 95 % and 99 % result
in Amax = 76 and 353, respectively, for the undisturbed cavity. At zero shift these
values have been scaled to 1 for comparison of their fractional decline.

11 Discussion

The γγ-collider will be operated with trains of optical ps-pulses, whereas the
optical interferometric detection of gravitational waves relies on continous-
wave (cw) laser radiation. An automatic alignment system has already been
developed for gravitational wave detection [69,70]. Therefore, use of an ad-
ditional uninterrupted train of weak ps-pulses for generation of error signals
resulting from misaligned components and constant control of the cavity seems
promising, as the cavity for the γγ-collider can beneﬁt from that knowledge.

The tiny absorption of the laser beam within the substrate and mirror coating
is expected to induce a nonuniform temperature increase within the optic due
to the amount of circulating optical power. This causes a nonuniform distor-
tion of the optical path length by thermal expansion of the optic’s surface, and
a variation of the material’s refractive index with temperature (thermal lens-
ing). In our numerical model the focal length has to stay within a few tenth
mm of its exact value for missing the desired beam waist by not more than
5 %. A correction of the curvature radius of imaging mirrors has already been
demonstrated by exerting an axially symmetrical mechanical strain within
the reﬂecting surface through radiative heating [71]. The remaining non-axial-
symmetric wavefront distortion generated by inhomogeneities in the substrate
can be compensated by locally heating the mirror in addition with another

laser via further computer controlled scanning mirrors. A proof-of-principle
experiment has been performed in [72].

Moreover, the high misalignment sensitivity of the proposed cavity could be
overcome by the introduction of adaptive optics for ensuring and controlling
the development of a diﬀraction limited optical mode. This requires an ad-
ditional control loop acting on the surface shape of at least one deformable
mirror. The ﬂat folding mirrors M1 and M2 adjacent to the telescopes in Fig. 4
appear to be especially well suited for this task.

The proposed cavity approximates a half-degenerate cavity which is character-
ized by a round-trip matrix of -1 times the unity matrix. In a half-degenerate
cavity, the intensity distribution at any position along the propagation axis is
relay imaged at completion of two circulations. Such a cavity can already be
described in good approximation by ray-tracing (geometric-optical imaging).
Diﬀraction has only be taken into account for calculation of the focus.

12 Conclusion

The actual enhancement factor of the cavity results from the cumulative eﬀect
of many small contributions aﬀecting the total loss factor. Residual abbera-

22

tions tend to enlarge the focused beam at the Compton conversion point. Both
are diﬃcult to predict in advance. However, the inﬂuence of diﬀraction loss is
for the proposed cavity almost negligible.

According to an estimation based on the known properties of laser induced
damage, the suggested size of the mirrors provides still some reserve before
the energy ﬂuence of the circulating optical pulse reaches the damage thresh-
old. For a ﬁnal judgement of the upper limit, an experimental study with a
representative of the special ILC bunch structure is required.

The use of adaptive optics appears to be essential for operation of such a
cavity.

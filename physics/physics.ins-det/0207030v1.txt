Method for control gas diﬀusion and bubbles
formation in liquid porosimetry

Dr. V. Smirichinski∗

Abstract

The main problem in liquid porosimetry, which prevents to see the pore sizes smaller
than 2 microns in diameter, is direct gas diﬀusion ﬂow through a micro-porous mem-
brane. This diﬀusion causes bubbles formation below the membrane and that spoils
extrusion (intrusion) data, as one cannot distinguish the volume of extrusion (intru-
sion) liquid from the volume of formatted bubbles. The suggested below method cures
the problem by creating the liquid ﬂow below the membrane. The ﬂow washes out
all of the small bubbles preventing them to grow. That allows using the membrane at
higher diﬀerential pressures, even higher than minimum bubble point of the membrane,
without spoiling data.

I. Description

A. Background of the invention

A1. Field of the invention

The present invention relates to the ﬁeld of porosimetry, particularly to the liquid (not
mercury) extrusion or intrusion porosimeter. In suggested method the porosity is measured
by detecting volume of liquid extruded from (or intruded in) the sample by applying step
by step increasing (decreasing) gas pressure. The sample is placed on a porous membrane
with pore-size less than the pore-size of the sample.

A2. Description of the previous art

The liquid porosimeter, described by Bernard Miller and Ilya Tyomkin [1], is shown

schematically in the Fig. 1.

Figure 1: Basic arrangement for liquid porosmetry.

It can be used in both liquid extrusion porosimetry (LEP) and liquid intrusion porosime-
try (LIP). For the LEP mode a presaturated sample is placed on a micro-porous membrane
(membrane is supported by a rigid porous plate). The gas pressure is increased in steps and
that causes liquid to extrude from the pores. The largest pores extrude ﬁrst. The top-loading
balance for each pressure step measures the liquid out-coming from the sample. The ﬁnal
data for analyzes could be represented as a function relation V (DP ), i.e. extruded volume
versus diﬀerential pressure (DP = P 1 − P 2). Assuming that all of the through-pores are
cylindrical we can apply Laplas equation d = 4g cos(q)/DP to convert the ﬁnal data to the
form V (d).

The same principal works for LIP mode, with the diﬀerence in starting at high pressure
and decreasing it stepwise; and, of course, the sample is not initially saturated. Also LIP
test can be run just after LEP test to see for example liquid extrusion-intrusion hysteresis.
Diﬀerent liquids can be used in LEP and LIP tests. The only requirements are the following:
liquid must wet the sample and membrane; the contact angle for the system of sample-liquid-
gas must be known; liquid should be stable and should have relatively low viscosity. That
is the principle of a liquid porosimetry test.

One of the technical problems in LEP and LIP is the control of pressure steps during
a test. B. Miller and I. Tyomkin [1] have proposed several innovations to control pressure
changes more accurately. Standard scheme of liquid porosimetry allows testing pore sizes
from 2000 to 2 micron in diameter. To see smaller pores the diﬀerential pressure should
be increased and as it was mentioned in [2] to see the smaller pores one need to increase
the pressure hyperbolically. Also the smaller pores have smaller ﬂow rate through and that
requires a longer exposure- time for high pressure. Under these speciﬁc conditions the gas
diﬀusion ﬂow causes the major problem – the bubble formations below the membrane. The
volume of the bubbles cannot be distinguished from the volume of the liquid extruded from
(intruded in) the sample and that spoils the ﬁnal data when one tries to see the smallest
pores. At this point I will discuss the problem in more details.

B. Problem with standard liquid porosimetry

To see the mentioned above gas diﬀusion clearly, it is enough to run LEP test without a
sample (just a membrane alone). If you neglect the eﬀect of diﬀusion (hypothetical situation)
the ﬁnal data must look like data 1(ideal graph) on Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Data on membrane test in LEP with diﬀerent time-steps (here the time in second
denotes the total time spent for each pressure step). The bubble point for the membrane is
10.1 PSI.

But in real test the data looks like graphs 2-4 on Fig 2. One can see that the longest
in time exposure under pressure causes the largest deﬂection from theoretical curve (ideal
graph) and that is due the bubbles formatted below the membrane. To prove the last
statement it is enough to perform some changes in LEP scheme.

Let’s do the test with little modiﬁcation as it shown schematically on Fig. 3.
The diﬀerence with standard liquid porosimeter is that the pump creates a ﬂow below
the membrane. That ﬂow washes out the bubbles. And if all of the tubes are made from the
transparent material one can see the bubbles coming from membrane. Since the pressure,
when the bubbles start to come out, is far below from the bubble point pressure (pressure
which opens the largest pores of the membrane) one concludes that bubble formation is due
to the gas diﬀusion ﬂow.

There are at least two possibilities to correct the eﬀect of gas diﬀusion in liquid porosime-
try tests. The ﬁrst possibility is to run the test as fast as possible when the test-time is less
then the time for signiﬁcant eﬀect of gas diﬀusion. But that is possible under very special
condition such as high liquid ﬂow rate through the system sample-membrane. The second
possibility is to study the bubble formation eﬀect of the given membrane and then by know-
ing that information try to subtract the bubble formation from the ﬁnal data. Practically
that means to run just the membrane as a blank test then to subtract the blank data from
the ﬁnal sample data. Both these possibilities are useful but they cannot solve the problem
radically.

C. Description of the invention

Figure 3: Modiﬁed scheme of liquid porosimetry.

To solve the problem of the gas diﬀusion bubble formation I suggest a method of control-
ling gas diﬀusion and bubble formation in liquid porosimetry. The essence of the method is
the creation of the liquid-ﬂow bellow the membrane to wash out the gas bubbles during the
test. On Fig. 3 the scheme of the method is shown. The diﬀerences with standard liquid
porosimetry presented on Fig.1 are obvious. I used the pump with variable ﬂow. The pump
can be switch on in reverse mode. The direction of the ﬂow is not important here. During
the test the pump was on constantly. The bubbles wash out into the glass, which is placed
on the top-loading balance. When pump is on it causes diﬀerential pressure between points
A and B below the membrane no more than 0.05 − 0.2 PSI depending on ﬂow through the
pump. That causes an error in real pressure reading of DP. To reduce this error I recommend
switching the pump to high pressure. For example at DP = 10PSI and P A − P B = 0.05
PSI the error in pressure reading is just 0.5%, at DP = 100PSI and P A − P B = 0.2PSI
the error is 0.2%. At low pressure there is no need to have a liquid ﬂow bellow membrane
because the rate of bubble formation is not signiﬁcant.

The actual realization of the method is the following: The membrane is placed on
thin metal screen support (I used Millipore 47mm SST Support Screen). To prevent the
deformation of the screen under the pressure another support is placed under the ﬁrst screen-
support. The last one contains parallel grooves to direct the liquid ﬂow (see Fig. 4) and two
holes for incoming and out-coming tubes. The pump used was Fisher brand Variable-Flow
Peristaltic Pump with ability to regulate the liquid ﬂow from 4.0 up to 85.0 mL/min. All
other features are the same in principle as in standard liquid porosimetry [1, 2].

II. Conclusion

The suggested method allows controlling the diﬀusion through membrane. It allows the using
membrane up to bubble point pressure and even more, if the gas ﬂow through membrane
just after the bubble point is very small (several cc/min.). For example, with a milli-pore
0.025 micron (mm) membrane using Galwick as a liquid it is possible to see 0.1 micron pore
sizes in diameter, which correspond to up 100-PSI pressure.

Using the considered scheme and method the liquid porosimetry overcomes its current

physical limits pointing to the left problem of ﬁnding better membranes.

Abstract

Micro-pattern gas detectors, such as the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) and the Mi-
cromegas need narrow high density anode readout elements to achieve good spatial
resolution. A high-density anode readout would require an unmanageable number
of electronics channels for certain potential micro-detector applications such as the
Time Projection Chamber. We describe below a new technique to achieve good
spatial resolution without increasing the electronics channel count in a modiﬁed
micro-detector outﬁtted with a high surface resistivity anode readout structure. The
concept and preliminary measurements of spatial resolution from charge dispersion
in a modiﬁed GEM detector with a resistive anode are described below.

1 Introduction

A new class of high-resolution multi-channel gas avalanche micro-detectors has
been developed during the past decade for charged particle tracking. The Gas

the new micro-pattern gas detectors [3] already in wide use. The GEM and the
Micromegas sample the avalanche charge using arrays of closely spaced long
parallel anode strips to measure a single co-ordinate. Spatial resolutions of 40
to 50 µm are typical with anodes strips at 200 µm pitch. Micro-detectors do
require more instrumented channels of electronics than multi-wire proportional
chambers. However, the number of readout channels has not yet become an
issue for most experiments using micro-detectors for charged particle tracking.

There are potential micro-detector applications, however, where the electronics
channel count may become an issue. The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) [4]
used in high energy physics experiments is one such example. A single endcap
detector is used in the TPC to measure both the radial and the azimuthal
co-ordinates of the ionization charge cluster. In the conventional TPC, read
out with a multi-wire proportional chamber endcap, the radial co-ordinate is
obtained from the anode wire position. A precise second co-ordinate along the
anode wire length is measured by sampling the induced cathode charge with
a series of several mm wide rectangular pads.

The spatial resolution of a TPC in a high magnetic ﬁeld is dominated by the
E ×B and track angle systematic eﬀects [5,6]. Replacement of the usual anode
wire/cathode pad readout with one based on micro-detectors with anode pad
readout would almost entirely eliminate the systematics and has the potential
to improve the TPC performance signiﬁcantly. However, the suppression of
the transverse diﬀusion in a high magnetic ﬁeld may often result in the collec-
tion of most of the avalanche charge within the width of a single anode pad
resulting in a loss of TPC resolution. For better resolution, a micro-detector
readout TPC will need either a ﬁnely segmented anode pad structure with
a prohibitively large number of instrumented channels of electronics, or per-
haps the complication of specially shaped pads which enhance anode charge
sharing [7].

We describe here a new technique which can be used to measure the position
of a localized charge cluster in a micro-detector using pads of widths similar
to those used in wire-pad systems. Most of our tests have so far been done
with a modiﬁed double-GEM detector. However, the new technique appears
to be suﬃciently general to be applicable to the Micromegas.

2 Charge dispersion in a micro-detector with a resistive anode

With certain modiﬁcations to the anode readout structure, it is possible to
measure the position of a localized charge cluster in a micro-detector with
pads wider than have been used so far. A thin high surface resistivity ﬁlm
is glued to a separate readout pad plane and is used for the anode (Fig. 1).

2

The resistive anode ﬁlm forms a distributed 2-dimensional resistive-capacitive
network with respect to the readout pad plane. Any localized charge arriving
at the anode surface will be dispersed with the RC time constant determined
by the anode surface resistivity and the capacitance density determined by
the spacing between the anode and readout planes. With the initial charge
dispersed and covering a larger area with time, wider pads can be used for
signal pickup and position determination. Features of the new method can be
explained by a simple physical model described below.

2.1 A model for charge dispersion in a micro-detector with a resistive anode

The resistive anode and the readout plane together can be looked upon to form
a distributed 2 dimensional RC network in the ﬁnite element approximation.
Consider ﬁrst the 1 dimensional problem of a point charge arriving at t = 0
at the origin in the middle of an inﬁnitely long wire grounded at both ends.
For small inductance, the space-time evolution of the charge density ρ on the
wire is given by the well-known Telegraph equation:

∂ρ
∂t

= h

∂2ρ
∂x2

where

h = 1/RC .

Here R is resistance per unit length and C the capacitance per unit length for
the wire.

The solution for charge density is given by:

ρ(x, t) =

exp(−x2/4th) .

4πth

s

In analogy with the 1 dimensional case, we can write the Telegraph equation
for the case of a resistive surface. At time t = 0, a point charge is collected at
the origin by a resistive anode surface of inﬁnite radius (for simplicity). The
2-dimensional Telegraph equation for the charge density is:

∂ρ
∂t

= h

∂r2 +

where in this case, R is the surface resistivity and C is capacitance per unit
area.

The solution for the charge density function in this case is given by:

ρ(r, t) =

exp(−r2/4th) .

s

The charge density function (equation 4) for the resistive anode varies with
time and is capacitively sampled by the readout pads. Fig. 2 shows the time
evolution of the charge density for an initially localized charge cluster in a
micro-detector with a resistive anode. The charge signal on a pad can be
computed by integrating the time dependent charge density function over
the pad area. The shape of the charge pulse on a pad depends on the pad
geometry, the location of the pad with respect to the initial charge and the
RC time constant of the system.

2.2 Charge dispersion signal in micro-detectors with long readout strips

The charge dispersion measurements were carried out with a modiﬁed GEM
detector with long anode strips. Since a spatial co-ordinate measurement for
long strips is meaningful only in a direction transverse to the strip length, we
can use the 1-dimensional Telegraph equation (1) to describe the situation.
However, the solution for the charge density must account for the ﬁnite size
of the resistive anode in contrast to the solution given by equation (2) in the
long wire approximation.

The boundary conditions to solve equation (1) in this case are:

ρ(x = 0, t) = ρ(x = s, t) = 0 ; 0 ≤ t ≤ ∞ ,

where s is the size of the resistive foil (assumed square) held at ground poten-
tial along its boundary.

The solution satisfying the ﬁnite boundary conditions is:

ρ(x, t) =

Am exp[−(hmπ/s)2t] sin(xmπ/s) ,

where the coeﬃcients Am can be determined from the knowledge of the initial
charge density:

The signal on a readout strip can be computed by integrating the charge
density function over the strip width. Furthermore, the ﬁnite extent of the
initial charge cluster, the intrinsic micro-detector charge signal rise time as well
as the rise and fall time characteristics of the front-end electronics determine
the shape of the measured signal shape. All these parameters need to be
included in the model to compare to the experiment.

Model calculations were done for a GEM detector with a resistive anode read-
out with 1 mm wide strips. The anode resistivity and anode-readout gap in
the simulation were chosen to limit the computed spatial spread of the charge
dispersion over pads to about 700 µm comparable to transverse diﬀusion in a
high magnetic ﬁeld TPC. Simulated signals for the readout strip directly below
the initial ionization charge cluster and for the next four adjacent strips are
shown in Fig. 3. The same ﬁgure also shows the simulated pad response func-
tion or equivalently the spatial spread of an initially localized charge cluster
due to charge dispersion.

3 Spatial resolution measurements in a GEM detector with a re-

sistive anode

The charge dispersion test measurements were made with the modiﬁed double-
GEM detector (Fig. 1) ﬁlled with Ar/CO2 90/10. A 50 µm thick Mylar ﬁlm
with a surface resistivity of 2.5 MΩ per square was glued to the pad readout
board. The spacing between the anode and readout planes was close to 100 µm
including the thickness of the glue.

Fig. 4 shows the experimental setup for the space point resolution measure-
ments. The initial ionization is provided by x-ray photon conversion in the gas.
The average photon energy was about 4.5 keV as low energy bremsstrahlung
photons from the copper target x-ray tube, run at 7 kV, were absorbed by the
material in the x-ray tube and detector windows. A ∼40 µm pinhole in a thin
brass sheet was used to produce a miniaturized x-ray tube focal spot image
in the GEM drift gap. The size of the x-ray spot at the detector is estimated
to be on the order of 70 µm. After avalanche multiplication and diﬀusion, the
RMS size of the electron cloud reaching the resistive anode was ∼400 µm. The
gas gain was about 3000.

Signals were read out from 7 cm long and 1.5 mm wide strips. The front-end
electronics consisted of Aleph [6] TPC wire charge preampliﬁers followed by
receiver ampliﬁers. Signals from 8 contiguous strips were digitized using two
4-channel Tektronix digitizing oscilloscopes. A computerized translation stage
was used to move the x-ray spot in small steps over the width of the centre
strip. One thousand event runs were recorded for each x-ray spot position on

5

an event by event basis.

For a given anode surface resistivity and readout geometry, the observed shape
of the charge pulse depends on the strip position with respect to the location
of primary charge cluster on the resistive anode. Fig. 5 shows an event where
the x-ray ionization spot is located directly above the centre of a readout
strip. A fast charge pulse is observed on the strip peaking in time with the
maximum of the charge density at the anode surface above. Pulses on strips
farther away have a slower rise time and peak late because the local charge
density on the anode surface nearest the strip reaches its maximum later.
Also, an early short duration induced pulse is visible for strips adjacent to
the main strip. The induced pulses [8], produced by electron motion in the
GEM induction gap, have demonstrated position sensitivity [9] but require the
use of high-speed pulse shape sampling electronics. In addition, measurable
induced pulses are speciﬁc to GEM detectors with sizeable induction gaps.
For charge dispersion measurements described below, the induced GEM pulse
information has not been used.

4 Data analysis and results

The charge dispersion signals were conﬁned to a narrow region on the readout
board in the present setup. There were measurable signals above noise only on
three 1.5 mm wide strips. The analysis to determine the space point resolution
from the event by event data consisted of following steps: a) Determine the
pulse heights of signals on the strips, independent of rise time; b) Compute
a centre of gravity position for the event from the measured pulse heights; c)
Correct for the bias in the computed centre of gravity to obtain the position
of the ionization cluster for the event. The standard deviation of the bias
corrected centre of gravity position with respect to the known x-ray beam
spot position for the run gives a measure of the space point resolution.

The data from each 1000 event run were sub-divided into two equal data sets:
one used for calibration and one for resolution studies. The pulse heights were
obtained by ﬁtting polynomial functions to the digitized pulse shape data.
The calibration data set was used to determine and ﬁx the coeﬃcients of
polynomial functions (see Fig. 6) used subsequently in the analysis of events
in the resolution data set.

The centres of gravity for the events in the calibration data set were computed
from the measured pulse heights. The correction function for the bias in the
centre of gravity method (see Fig. 7) was determined by plotting the mean
value of computed centres of gravity against the known x-ray spot position
for the individual runs.

6

The pulse heights and the peak positions for the events used for resolution
studies were determined by ﬁtting the pulses to the ﬁxed polynomials shapes
obtained from the corresponding calibration data set. The computed centres
of gravity were converted to “true position” by interpolation using the bias
correction function determined from the calibration data set. Fig. 8 shows the
measured resolution function for the 1.5 mm wide strips at two diﬀerent po-
sitions of the x-ray ionization spot over the strip. Fig. 9 shows the measured
spatial resolutions and the position residuals: i.e. the deviation of measured
positions from the micrometer settings. The small systematic trends apparent
in the plot appear to be related to an imprecise knowledge of the experimen-
tal parameters in the present setup and any remaining biases in the present
method of analysis. Nevertheless, the standard deviations of the position mea-
surements, in the range of 50 to 80 µm, are all consistent with the size of the
collimated x-ray spot at the detector.

5 Outlook and summary

We have demonstrated that a controlled RC dispersion of the avalanche charge
makes it possible to measure its position with a micro-detector with strips
wider than have been used previously. The pad response function and signal
shapes are determined by the anode surface resistivity and anode-readout
plane gap. With the proper choice of the RC time constant of the system,
the charge dispersion technique will not compromise the counting rate ability
of the detector. Nor should it compromise the 2-track resolving power of the
detector which should be limited only by the diﬀusion eﬀects in the gas. Once
the characteristics of the charge dispersion signal are properly understood, it
should also be possible to simplify the technique replacing the pulse shape
measurement system with less expensive charge integrating electronics.

The charge dispersion space point resolution studies described here were done
for long readout strips in a modiﬁed GEM detector with a resistive anode.
Further experimental and simulation studies are in progress to investigate the
spatial resolution capabilities of the charge dispersion technique with rectangu-
lar pads similar to those used in wire-cathode pad TPCs. We are also testing
the concept of position sensing from charge dispersion with the Miromegas
where the high anode resistance may help improve the detector HV stability
as well as protect the front-end electronics from spark damage.

Abstract

Smart use of mixers is a relevant issue in radio engineering and in
instrumentation design, and of paramount importance in phase noise
metrology. However simple the mixer seems, every time I try to explain
to a colleague what it does, something goes wrong. One diﬃculty
is that actual mixers operate in a wide range of power (150 dB or
more) and frequency (up to 3 decades). Another diﬃculty is that the
mixer works as a multiplier in the time-domain, which is necessary to
convert frequencies. A further diﬃculty is the interaction with external
circuits, the input sources and the load. Yet far the biggest diﬃculty is
that designing with mixers requires a deep comprehension of the whole
circuit at system level and at a component level. As the electronic-
component approach is well explained in a number of references, this
tutorial emphasizes the system approach, aiming to provide wisdom
and insight on mixes.

1 Basics

It is ﬁrst to be understood that the mixer is mainly intended, and mainly doc-
umented, as the frequency converter of the superheterodyne receiver (Fig. 1).
The port names, LO (local oscillator, or pump), RF (radio-frequency), and
IF (intermediate frequency) are clearly inspired to this application.

assumptions that vp(t) is large as compared to the diode threshold, and that
vi(t) is small, the ring acts a switch. During the positive half-period of vp(t)
two diodes are reverse biased and the other two diodes are forward biased
to saturation. During the negative half-period the roles are interchanged.
For the small RF signal, the diodes are open circuit when reverse biased,
and small resistances when forward biased. As a result, the IF signal vo(t)
vi(t) depending on the sign of vp(t). This is

the sign from vp(t). In most practical cases, it is suﬃcient to describe the
frequency conversion mechanism as the product between vi(t) and the ﬁrst
term of the Fourier expansion of the square wave. More accurate models
account for the higher-order Fourier terms, and for the dynamic resistance
and capacitance of the diodes.

At the RF and LO sides, a balun is necessary in order to convert the
unbalanced inputs into the balanced signals required for the ring to operate
as a switch. Conversely, no adapter is needed at the IF output, which is
already unbalanced. In low-frequency mixers (from a few kHz to 2–3 GHz)
the baluns are implemented with power iron tore transformers. At higher
frequencies, up to some tens of GHz, transformers are not available, for
microstrip networks are the preferred balun types. The typical LO power is
of 5–10 mW (7–10 dBm), whereas in some cases a power up to 1 W (30 dBm)
is used for highest linearity. The RF power should be at least 10 dB lower
than the LO power. The diodes are of the Schottky types, because of the low
forward threshold and of the fast switching capability. The characteristic
impedance to which all ports should be terminated is R0 = 50 Ω, with rare
exceptions.

The mixer can be used in a variety of modes, each with its “personality”
and peculiarities, listed in Table 2, and detailed in the next Sections. In short
summary, the mixer is (almost) always used with the LO input saturated at
the nominal power. Then, the main parameters governing the behavior are:

Input power. The input (RF) power is usually well below the saturation
level, as in Figures 1–2. Yet, the input can be intentionally saturated.

Frequency degeneracy. When the input (RF) and LO frequency overlap,

the conversion product also overlap.

Interchanging the RF and IF ports. The diﬀerence is that the RF port

is coupled in ac, while the IF port is often coupled in dc.

Additionally, the mixer is sometimes used in a strange mode, with both
LO and RF inputs not saturated.

1.1 Golden rules

1. First and foremost, check upon saturation at the LO port and identify

the operating mode (Table 2).

2. Generally, all ports should be reasonably impedance matched, other-

wise reﬂected waves result in unpredictable behavior.

3. When reﬂected waves can be tolerated, for example at low frequencies
or because of some external circuit, impedance plays another role. In
fact, the appropriate current ﬂow is necessary for the diodes to switch.

4. In all cases, read carefully Sections 3.1 to 3.3.

1.2 Avoid damage

However trivial, avoid damage deserves a few words because the device can
be pushed in a variety of non-standard operation modes, which increases
the risk.

1. Damage results from excessive power. Some confusion between maxi-
mum power for linear operation and the absolute maximum power to
prevent damage is common in data sheets.

8

2. The nominal LO power (or range) refers to best performance in the
linear conversion mode. This value can be exceeded, while the absolute
maximum power can not.

3. The maximum RF power is speciﬁed as the maximum power for linear
operation. When linearity is not needed this value can be exceeded,
while the absolute maximum power can not.

4. Voltage driving may result in the destruction of the mixer for two
reasons. The diode i = i(v) characteristics is exponential in v, for the
current tend to exceed the maximum when the diode is driven by a
voltage source. The thin wires of the miniature transformers tend to
blow up as a fuse if the current is excessive.

5. In the absence of more detailed information, the absolute maximum
power speciﬁed for the LO port can be used as the total dissipated
power, regardless of where power enters.

6. The absolute maximum LO power can also be used to guess the max-
imum current through one diode. This may be useful in dc or degen-
erated modes, where power is not equally split between the diodes.

Better than general rules, a misfortunate case occurred to me suggests to be
careful about subtle details. A $ 3000 mixer used as a phase detector died
unexpectedly, without being overloaded with microwave power. Further
analysis showed that one rail of a dc supply failed, and because of this the
bipolar operational ampliﬁer (LT-1028) connected to the IF port sank a
current from the input (20 mA?).

2 Signal representations

The simple sinusoidal signal takes the form

v(t) = A0 cos(ω0t + φ) .

This signal has rms value A0/√2 and phase φ. An alternate form often
encountered is

v(t) = Vrms√2 cos(ω0t + φ)
= V ′√2 cos(ω0t)

V ′′√2 sin(ω0t) ,

−

with

V ′ = Vrms cos φ
V ′′ = Vrms sin φ
Vrms =

(V ′)2 + (V ′′)2
φ = arctan(V ′′/V ′) .

The form (2)-(3) relates to the phasor representation1

which is obtained by freezing the ω0 oscillation, and by turning the amplitude

equal to the phase φ of the time-domain sinusoid. The “sin ω0t” term in
” for consistency with Eq. (8).
Eq. (3) has a sign “

Another form frequently used is the analytic (complex) signal

−

v(t) = V ejω0t ,

where the complex voltage V = V ′ + jV ′′ is consistent with Eq. (8). The
analytic signal has zero energy at negative frequencies, and double energy
at positive frequencies.

The product of two signals can only be described in the time domain
[Eq. (1), (2), (3)]. In fact, the phasor representation (8) is useless, and the
analytic signal (11) hides the down-conversion mechanism. This occurs be-
cause ejωatejωbt = ej(ωa+ωb)t, while the product of two sinusoids is governed
by

Thus, the product of two sinusoids yields the sum and the diﬀerence of the
two input frequencies (Fig. 3). A pure sinusoidal signal is represented as a
pair of Dirac delta function δ(ω
ω0) and δ(ω + ω0) in the spectrum, or as
a single δ(ω
ω0) in the case of the analytic signal. All the forms (1), (2),
(3), (8), and (11) are also suitable to represent (slow-varying) modulated
signals. A modulated signal can be represented2 as

v(t) = A′(t) cos(ω0t)

A′′(t) sin(ω0t) .

A′(t) and A′′(t) are the low-pass signals that contain information. They
may include a dc term, which accounts for the carrier, like in the old AM
and PM. Strictly, it is not necessary that A′(t) and A′′(t) are narrow-band.
The time-depencence of A′(t) and A′′(t) spreads the power around ω0. The
spectrum of the modulated signal is a copy of the two-side spectrum of A′(t)
and A′′(t) translated to
ω0. Thus, the bandwidth of the modulated signal
(15) is twice the bandwidth of A′(t) and A′′(t). Not knowing the real shape,
the spectrum can be conventionally represented as a rectangle centered at
the carrier frequency, which occupies the bandwidth of A′ and A′′ on each
side of

ω0 (Fig. 4).

±

Of course, Equations (12)–(14) also apply to the product of modulated
signals, with their time-dependent coeﬃcients A′(t) and A′′(t). Using mix-
ers, we often encounter the product of a pure sinusoid [Eq. (1)] multiplied
by a modulated signal [Eq. (15)]. The spectrum of such product consists of
two replicas of the modulated input, translated to the frequency sum and
to the frequency diﬀerence (IF signal Fig. 4).

±

3 Linear modes

For the mixer to operate in any of the linear modes, it is necessary that

the LO port is saturated by a suitable sinusoidal signal,

a small (narrowband) signal is present at the RF input.

•

•

The reader should refer to Sec. 3.3 for more details about linearity.

3.1 Linear frequency converter (LC) mode

The additional condition for the mixer to operate as a linear frequency
converter is that the LO and the RF signals are separated in the frequency
domain (Fig. 4).

It is often convenient to describe the mixer as a system (Fig. 5), in which
the behavior is modeled with functional blocks. The clipper at the LO input
limits the signal to the saturation level VS, while the clipper at the RF port

nal LO voltage vl(t) is approximately a trapezoidal waveform that switches
between the saturated levels
VS. The value of VS is a characteristic pa-
rameter of the speciﬁc mixer. The eﬀect of higher LO power is to shrink
the fraction of period taken by the slanted edges, rather than increasing VS.

It is therefore impossible to ascribe a given vo(t) to vL(t) or to
its image vU (t) if no a-priori information is given. Fig. 6 (middle) gives
the explanation in terms of spectra. The USB and the LSB are image
of one another with respect to ωl.

the other one as the image. All the terms with k > 1, thus 3ω0, 5ω0, etc.,
as stray signals taken in because of distortion. Of course, the mixer can
be intentionally used to convert some frequency slot through multiplication
by one harmonic of the LO, at the cost of lower conversion eﬃciency. A
bandpass ﬁlter at the RF input is often necessary to stop unwanted signals.
Sampling mixers are designed for this speciﬁc operation. Yet their internal
structure diﬀers from that of the common double-balanced mixer.

The ﬁrst term of Eq. (32) is equivalent to (17), thus VL,1 = VL. Equation
(32) diﬀers from Eq. (16) in the presence of the phase terms φk, and in that
the coeﬃcient VL,k decrease more rapidely than 1/k. This due to non-perfect
saturation and to bandwidth limitation. In weak saturation conditions the
coeﬃcient VL,k decrease even faster.

Looking at Eq. (16), one should recall that frequency multiplication re-
sults in phase noise multiplication. If the LO signal contains a (random)
phase ϕ(t), the phase kϕ(t) is present in the k-th term.

Equation (36) is valuable for design purposes. Yet, it is of limited usefulness
in analysis because some parameters, like Is and η are hardly available. In
addition, Eq. (36) holds in quasistatic conditions and does not account for a
number of known eﬀects, like stray inductances and capacitances, varactor
eﬀect in diodes, bulk resistance of the semiconductors, and other losses.
Nonetheless, Eq. (36) provides insight in the nature of the coeﬃcients VL,k.

Rules for the load impedance at the IF port. The product of two
sinusoids at frequency ωi and ωl, inherently, contains the frequencies ωi
ωl.
At the IF port, current ﬂow must be allowed at both these frequencies,
otherwise the diodes can not switch. The problem arises when IF selection
ﬁlter shows high impedance in the stop band. Conversely, low impedance
R0 is usually allowed. Figure 8 shows three typical cases in which a

. The scheme A is correct because the

|
|
image-frequency current can ﬂow through the diodes (low impedance). The
scheme B will not work because the ﬁlter is nearly open circuit at the image
frequency. The scheme C is a patched version of B, in which an additional
RC cell provides the current path for the image frequency. The eﬃcient use
of a mixer as a multi-harmonic converter may require a speciﬁc analysis of
the ﬁlter.

In microwave mixers, the problem of providing a current path to the
image frequency may not be visible, having been ﬁxed inside the mixer.
This may be necessary when the image frequency is out of the bandwidth,
for the external load can not provide the appropriate impedance.

Rules are diﬀerent in the case of the phase detector because the current

path is necessary at the 2ωl frequency, not at dc.

Can the LO and RF ports be interchanged? With an ideal mixer yes,
in practice often better not. Looking at Fig. 2, the center point of the LO
transformer is grounded, which helps isolation. In the design of microwave

mixers, where the transformers are replaced with microstrip baluns, opti-
mization may privilege isolation from the LO pump, and low loss in the RF
circuit. This is implied in the general rule that the mixer is designed and
documented for the superheterodyne receiver. Nonetheless, interchanging
RF and LO can be useful in some cases, for example to take beneﬁt from
the diﬀerence in the input bandwidth.

3.2 Linear Synchronous Detector (SD) Mode

The general conditions for the linear modes are that the LO port is saturated
by a suitable sinusoidal signal, and that a small (narrowband) signal is
present at the RF input. The additional conditions for the mixer to operate
in the SD mode are: (1) the LO frequency ωl is tuned at the center of
the spectrum of the (narrowband) RF signal, and (2) the IF output is low-
passed.

The basic mixer operation is the same of the frequency conversion mode,
with the diode ring used as a switch that inverts or not the input polarity

the SD mode. Yet, the frequency conversion mechanism is slightly diﬀerent.
Figure 9 shows the SD mode in the frequency domain, making use of two-

Equation (49) is the common form of a frame rotation by the angle φL in
Cartesian coordinates (Fig. 12).

The simultaneous detection of the input signal with two mixers pumped
in quadrature is common in telecommunications, where QAM modulations
are widely used5. The theory of coherent communication is analyzed in
[Vit66]. Devices like that of Fig. 13, known as I-Q detectors, are com-
mercially available from numerous manufacturers. Section 7 provide more
details on these devices.

mitted signal is of the form (37), with x and y quantized in 8 level (3 bits) each.

A function f (

f (ax) = af (x)

f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) .

(50)

(51)

The same deﬁnition applies to operators. When a sinusoidal signal of ap-
propriate power and frequency is sent to the LO port, the mixer is linear,
that is, the output signal vo(t) is a linear function of the input vi(t). This
can be easily proved for the case of simple conversion [Eq. (21)]

The linearity of vo(t) vs. vi(t) can also be demonstrated in the case of the
multi-harmonic conversion, either by taking a square wave as the LO internal
signal [Eq. (31)], or by using the internal LO signal of real mixers [Eq. (33)].
In fact, the Fourier series is a linear superposition of sinusoids, each of which
treated as above. In practice, the double balanced mixer can be used in a
wide range of frequency (up to 104), where it is linear in a wide range of
power, which may exceed 1016 (160 dB).

In large-signal conditions, the mixer output signal can be expanded as

the polynomial

vo(vi) = a0 + a1vi + a2v2

i + a3v3

i + . . .

.

(52)

The symmetric topology cancels the even powers of vi, for the above poly-
nomial can not be truncated at the second order. Yet, the coeﬃcient a2 is
nonzero because of the residual asymmetry in the diodes and in the baluns.
Another reason to keep the third-order term is the adjacent channel inter-
ference. In principle, transformer nonlinearity should also be analyzed. In
practice, this problem is absent in microwave mixers, and a minor concern
with ferrite cores. The coeﬃcient a1 is the invese loss ℓ. The coeﬃcients
a2 and a3 are never given explicitely. Instead, the intercept power (IP2 and
i and a3v3
IP3) is given, that is, the power at which the nonlinear term (a2v2
i )
is equal to the linear term.

4 Mixer loss

The conversion eﬃciency of the mixer is operationally deﬁned via the two-
tone measurement shown in Fig. 14. This is the case of a superheterodyne
receiver in which the incoming signal is an unmodulated sinusoid vi(t) =
Vi cos ωit, well below saturation. The LO sinusoid is set to the nominal
saturation power.
In this condition, and neglecting the harmonic terms
higher than the ﬁrst, the output signal consists of a pair of sinusoids of

where Pi is the power of the RF input, and Po is the power of the IF output
at the selected freqency. The speciﬁcations of virtually all mixes resort to
this deﬁnition.

The loss is about constant in a wide range of power and frequency. The
upper limit of the RF power range is the saturation power, speciﬁed as the
compression power P1 dB at which the loss increases by 1 dB.

Intrinsic SSB loss. The lowest loss refers to the ideal case of the zero-
threshold diode, free from resistive dissipation. The LO power is entirely
wasted in switching the diodes. Under this assumptions, the ring of Figure 2
works as a loss-free switch that inverts or not the polarity of the RF, vo(t) =
vi(t), according to the sign of vl(t). Of course, the instantaneous output

SSB loss of actual mixers. The loss of microwave mixer is usually be-
tween 6 dB for the 1-octave devices, and 9 dB for 3-octave units. The dif-
ference is due to the microstrip baluns that match the nonlinear impedance
of the diodes to the 50 Ω input over the device bandwidth. In the case of a
narrow-band mixer optimized for conversion eﬃciency, the SSB loss can be
of 4.5 dB [OMK80]. The loss of most HF/UHF mixers is of about 5–6 dB
in a band up to three decades. This is due to the low loss and to the large
bandwidth of the tranmission-line transformers. Generally, the LO satura-
tion power is between 5 and 10 mW (7–10 dBm). Some mixers, optimized
for best linearity make use of two or three diodes in series, or of two diode
rings (see Fig. 26), and need larger LO power (up to 1 W). The advantage
of these mixers is high intercept power, at the cost of larger loss (2–3 dB
more). When the frequencies multiple of the LO frequency are exploited to
convert the input signal, it may be necessary to measure the conversion loss.
A scheme is proposed in Fig. 15.

Derivation of the internal LO voltage from the loss. For the purpose
of analytical calculus, the amplitude VL of the internal LO signal is often
needed. With real (lossy) mixers, it holds that VL < 4
π V. VL can be derived
by equating the output power Pi/ℓ2 to the power of the output product. The

What if the LO power diﬀers from the nominal power? When the
LO input is saturated, the LO power has little or no eﬀect on the output
signal. This fact is often referred as power desensitization (also LO desen-
2 dB
sitization, or pump desensitization). In a narrow power range, say

±

26

from the nominal power, the conversion loss changes slightly, and noise also
varies. The internal Schottky diodes exhibit exponential i = i(v) character-
istics, hence lower LO power is not suﬃcient to saturate the diodes, and the
the ring is unable to switch. The conversion eﬃciency 1/ℓ is reduced, and
drops abruptly some 10 dB below the nominal LO power. As a side eﬀect of
loss, white noise increases. Figure 16 shows an example of output power as
a function of the RF power, for various LO power levels. Below the nominal
LO power, ﬂicker noise increases. Whereas this phenomenon is still unclear,
we guess that this is due to the increased fraction of period in which the
diodes are neither open circuit or saturated, and that up conversion of the
near-dc ﬂickering of the junction takes place during this transition time .

Insuﬃcient LO power may also impair symmetry, and in turn the cancel-
lation of even hamonics. The physical explanation is that saturated current
is limited by the diode bulk resistance, which is more reproducible than
the exponential law of the forward current. Increasing the fraction of time
in which the exponential law dominates emphasizes the asymmetry of the
diodes.

Too high LO power may increase noise, and damage the mixer. Special
care is recommanded with high-level mixers, in which the nominal LO power

Hence, the input power aﬀects the duration of the wavefronts, and in turns

power if stray input signals are not ﬁltered out properly.

Finally, changing the LO power aﬀects the dc voltage at the IF output.
This can be a serious problem when the mixer is used as a synchronous
converter or as a phase detector.

5 Saturated Modes

When both RF and LO inputs are saturated, the mixer behavior changes
radically. The mixer can no longer be described as a simple switch that
invert or not the RF signal, depending on the LO sign.
Instead, at each
instant the largest signal controls the switch, and sets the polarity of the
other one. Of course, the roles are interchanged continuously. Strong odd-
order harmonics of the two input frequencies are present, while even-order
harmonics are attenuated or cancelled by symmetry. Saturation means that
amplitude has little eﬀect on the output, for saturated modes are useful in
phase detectors or in frequency synthesis, where amplitudes are constant.
A further consequence of saturation is phase noise multiplication, which is
inherent in harmonic generation. In the case of saturated modes, phase noise

February 2, 2008

multiplication takes place in both LO and RF.

In saturated modes the speciﬁed maximum power at the RF port is
always exceeded. When this maximum power is exceeded, the mixer leaves
the “normal” linear operation, still remaining in a safe operating range until
the “absolute maximum ratings” are approached. Read page 7.

The model of Fig. 5 describes some characteristics, as it emphasizes
the internally clipped waveforms, and the cancellation of even harmonics.
Yet, the model fails in predicting amplitude because the ring is no longer a
multiplier. The output amplitude is lower than expected.

5.1 Saturated Frequency Converter (SC) Mode

The conditions for the mixer to operate in SC mode are

the LO and the RF ports are saturated by sinusoidal signals,

the input frequencies are not equal, and the ratio ωl/ωi is not too close
to the the ratio of two small integers (say, 5–7),

ﬂuenced by V ′

frequency of (72).

are multiplied by h and k, and wrong results may be obtained discarding
the sign.

5.2 Degenerated Frequency Converter (DC) Mode

Reality is even more complex than (76) because

some asymmetry is always present, thus even-order harmonics,

each term of (76) may contain an additional constant phase φhk,

for a given ωl ωi pair, several output frequencies nω0 exist, each one
described by (76). Due to nonlinearity, the vn(t) interact with one
another.

Fortunately, the amplitudes Vhk decrease rapidly with
, therefore the

sum (76) can be accurately estimated from a small number of terms, while
almost all the diﬃculty resides in parameter measurement. For this reason,
there is no point in devlopping a sophisticated theory, and the few cases of
interest can be anlyzed individually. The following example is representative
of the reality.

where the derivatives are evaluated in the static working point. There follows
that the input phase ﬂuctuations φl and φi are ampliﬁed or attenuated
(gain lower than one) by the mixer. The phase gain/attenuation mechanism
is a consequence of degeneracy. The eﬀect on phase noise was discovered
studying the regenerative frequency dividers [ROG92].

Figure 18 shows a simpliﬁed example in which a 5 MHz signal is obtained
by mixing a 5 MHz and a 10 MHz, accounting only for two modes (10

at its maximum. A small negative φn results from V−1 1 and V3 −1 pulling
in opposite directions. A phase ﬂuctuation is therefore attenuated. For

minimum. The combined eﬀect of V−1 1 and V3 −1 yields a large negative

The experimentalist not aware of degeneracy may obtain disappointing
results when low-order harmonics are present, as in the above example. The
deliberate exploitation of degeneracy to manage phase noise is one of the
most exhotic uses of the mixer.

Parameter Measurement. There are two simple ways to measure the
parameters of a degenerated frequency converter (Fig. 19).

The ﬁrst method is the separate measurement of the coeﬃcients Vhk of
Eq. (76) by means of a spectrum analyzer. One input signal is set at a fre-
quency δ oﬀ the nominal frequency ωl (or ωi). In this condition degeneracy
is broken, and all the terms of Eq. (76) are visible as separate frequencies.
The oﬀset δ must be large enough to enable the accurate measurement of all
the spectral lines with a spectrum analyzer, but small enough not to aﬀect
the mixer operation. Values of 10–50 kHz are useful in the HF/UHF bands,
and up to 1 MHz at higher frequencies. Figure 20 provides an example.
This method is simple and provides insight. On the other hand, it is not
very accurate because it hides the phase errors φhk that may be present in
each term.

The second method consists of the direct measurement of Vn [Eq. (77)]
as a function of the input phase, φl or φi, by means of a vector voltmeter.
This gives amplitude and phase, from which the phase gain is derived. For
the measurement to be possible, the three signals must be converted to the
same frequency ω0 with approprate dividers. Of course, the mixer must be
measured in the same conditions (RF and LO power) of the ﬁnal applica-
tion. While one vector voltmter is suﬃcient, it is better to use two vector

voltmters because the measurement accounts for the reﬂected waves in the
speciﬁc circuit. In some cases good results are obtained with resistive power
splitters located close to the mixer because these splitters are not directional.
Interestingly, most frequency synthesizers can be adjusted in phase even if
this feature is not explicitely provided. The trick consists of misaligning
the internal quartz oscillator when the instrument is locked to an external
frequency reference. If the internal phase locked loop does not contain an
integrator, the misalignamet turns into a phase shift, to be determined a
posteriori. The drawback of the direct measurement method is that it re-
quires up to two vector voltmeters, two frequency synthesizers and three
frequency dividers.
In the general case, the dividers can not be replaced
with commercial synthesizers because a synthesizer generally accepts only a
small set of round input frequencies (5 MHz or 10 MHz). Figure 21 shows
an example of direct measurement, compared to the calculated values, based
on the ﬁrst method.

Using the 2ω0 output signal to double the input frequency is a poor
choice because (i) the quadrature condition can only be obtained in a limited
bandwidth, (ii) the IF circuit is usually designed for frequencies lower than
the RF and LO. A better choice is to use a reversed mode.

When the PD mode is used close to the quadrature conditions, the devi-
ation of dc response from sin φ can be ignored. After low-pass ﬁltering, the

where kφ is the phase-to-voltage gain [the same as V0 in Eq. (80)], and Vos
is the dc oﬀset that derives from asymmetry. Figure 22 shows an example
of phase detector charactaristics. The IF output can be loaded to a high
resistance in order to increase the gain kφ.

It is often convenient to set the input phase for zero dc output, which
compensate for Vos. This condition occurs at some random—yet constant—
phase a few degrees oﬀ the quadrature conditions, in a range where the
mixer characteristics are virtually unaﬀected.

Due to diode asymmetry, the input power aﬀects Vos. Exploiting the
asymmetry of the entire v(i) law of the diodes, it is often possible to null
the output response to the ﬂuctuation of the input power, therefore to make
the mixer insensitive to amplitude modulation. This involves setting the
phase between the inputs to an appropriate value, to be determined exper-
imentally. In our experience, the major problem is that there are distinct

6 Reversed Modes

The mixer can be reversed taking the IF port as the input and the RF port
as the output (Fig. 23). The LO signal makes the diodes switch, exactly
as in the normal modes. The major diﬀerence versus the normal modes is
the coupling bandwidth: the output is now ac-coupled via the RF balun,
while the input is in most cases dc-coupled. When impedance-matching is
not needed, the IF input can be driven with a current source.

6.1 Linear Modulator (LM)

The mixer works as a LM in the following conditions

the LO port is saturated by a sinusoidal signal,

a near-dc signal is present at the IF input,

•

•

•

the IF input current is lower than the saturation current10 IS.

As usual, the LO pump forces the diodes to switch. At zero input cur-
rent, due to symmetry, no signal is present at the RF output. When a
positive current ii is present, the resistance of D2 and D4 averaged over
the period decreases, and the conduction angle of D2 and D4 increases.
The average resistance of D1 and D3 increases, and their conduction angle
decreases. Therefore, a small voltage vo(t) appears at the RF output, of
amplitude proportional to ii, in phase with vp(t). Similarly, a negative ii
produces an output voltage proportional to ii, of phase opposite to vp(t).
The mixer can be represented as the system of Fig. 24, which is similar to
the LC model (Fig. 5) but for the input-output ﬁlters. The internal sat-

urated LO signal can be approximated with a sinusoid vl(t) = VL cos ωlt,
[Eq. (17)], or expanded as Eq. (32). Strictly, VL can not be derived from
the reverse loss, which is not documented. Reciprocity should not given for
granted. Nonetheless, measuring some mixers we found that the ‘conven-
tional’ (forward) SSB loss ℓ and Eq. (69) provide useful approximation of
reverse behavior. Thus, the mixer operates as a linear modulator described
by

Example 3 The LO signal of a mixer (Mini-Circuits ZFM-2) is a sinusoid of
frequency fl = 100 MHz and power P = 5 mW (7 dBm). In such conditions
the nominal SSB loss is ℓ = 2 (6 dB). By virtue of Eq. (69), VL = 1 V. When
the input current is ii = 2 mA dc, the input voltage is vi = R0ii = 100 mV
with R0 = 50 Ω. After Eq. (84), we expect an output signal of 100 mV peak,
thus 71 mV rms. This is close to the measured value of 75 mV. The latter
is obtained ﬁtting the the low-current experimental data of Fig. 25. Beyond
ii = 3 mA, the mixer lives gradually the linear behavior, and saturates at
12 mA dc. Similar results

under the obvious condition that the signal bandwidth ﬁts into the ﬁlter
passband.

6.3 Digital Modulator (DM) Mode

The mixer works as a DM in the following conditions

the LO port is saturated by a sinusoidal signal,

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

a large near-dc current is present at the IF input, which is saturated,

the RF output is bandpassed.

Let vp = VP cos ωlt the LO input signal, ii =
VO the saturated output amplitude. The output signal is

±

Ii the IF input current, and

vo(t) = sgn(ii) VO cos ωlt ,

(90)

where sgn(
) is the signum function. Equation (90) represents a BPSK
·
(binary phase shift keying) modulation driven by the input current ii.

6.4 Reverse Saturated Converter (RSC) Mode

The mixer works in the RSC mode under the following conditions

the LO and the IF ports are saturated by sinusoidal signals,

the input frequencies are not equal, and the ratio ωl/ωi is not too close
to the the ratio of two small integers (say, 5-7 max.),

the output is band-passed.

The RSC mode is similar to the SC mode, for the explanations given in
Section 5.1 also apply to the RSC mode. The only diﬀerence between SC
and RSC is the input and output bandwidth, because IF and RF are inter-
changed.

6.5 Reverse Degenerated Converter (RDC) Mode

The mixer works in the RDC mode when

the LO and the IF ports are saturated by sinusoidal signals,

the input frequencies are equal, or the ratio ωl/ωi is equal or close to
the the ratio of two small integers (say, no more than 5–7),

the output is band-passed.

40

E. Rubiola Tutorial on mixers

February 2, 2008

The RDC mode is similar to the DC mode (Section 5.1) but for the trivial
diﬀerence in the input and output bandwidth, as the roles of IF and RF are
interchanged. The output signal results from the vector addition of several
beat signals, each one with its own phase and amplitude.

It is to be made clear that when two equal input frequencies (ωi = ωl =
ω0) are sent to the input, the reverse mode diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
normal mode. In the DC mode, this condition would turn the degenerated
converter mode into the phase-detector mode. But in the reversed modes
no dc output is permitted because the RF port is ac coupled. Of course,
a large 2ω0 signal is always present at the RF output, resulting from the
vector addition of several signals, which makes the RDC mode an eﬃcient
frequency doubler.

Example 4 The input frequencies are fl = fi = 5 MHz, and we select the
output fo = 10 MHz. Thus f0 = 5 MHz, p = 1, q = 1, and n = 2. The
output signal [Eq. (76)] results from the follwoing terms

purpose mixers documented for phase detector operation. Often the IF
output impedance is larger than 50 Ω, typically 500 Ω. The main advan-
tage of this higher impedance is a lower residual white noise of the system.
In fact, the output preampliﬁer can hardly be noise-matched to an input
resistance lower than a few hundreds Ohms. The IF bandwidth reduction
that results from the increased output impedance is not relevant in practice.
The residual ﬂicker, which is the most relevant parameter for a number of
measurements, is usually not documented11.

Analog Modulator / Variable Attenuator. A mixer can be designed
and documented to be used in a reverse mode as an analog modulator (See
Sec. 6.1). The fancy name “variable attenuator” is sometimes used. Yet, the

mixer operation is more general than that of a simple attenuator because
the mixer input current can be either positive or negative, and the output
signal changes sign when the input current is negative.

BPSK Modulator. The BPSK modulator diﬀers from the analog modu-
lator in that the IF input is saturated (See Sec. 6.3). Once again, the device
may diﬀer from a general-purpose mixer mostly in the documentation.

High Linearity Mixers.
In some cases low intermodulation performance
must be achieved at any cost. Special mixers are used, based on a ring in
which the diodes are replaced with the more complex elements shown in
Fig. 26 (classes I-III). High linearity is achieved by forcing the diodes to
switch abruptly in the presence of a large pump signal. These mixers, as
compared to the single-diode ones, need large LO power, up to 1 W, and
show higher loss.

Improved Impedance-Matching Mixers. The 90◦ hybrid junction,
used as a power splitter, has the useful property that the input (output)
is always impedance matched when the isolation port is correctly termi-
nated and the two outputs (inputs) are loaded with equal impedances. This
property is exploited joining two equal double-balanced mixers to form the
improved mixer of Fig. 27 (Class IV mixer). Other schemes are possible,
based on the same idea.

Double-Double-Balanced Mixers. The double-double-balanced mixer
(Figure 28) shows high 1 dB compression point, thus high dynamic range
and low distortion, and high isolation. This device is sometimes called triple
balanced mixer because it is balanced at the three ports. Other schemes are
possible.

Image-Rejection Mixer. Let us go back to the frequency conversion
system of Fig. 6, in which the LSB and the USB are converted into the
same IF frequency ωb. The scheme of Fig. 29 divides the IF components,
enabling the selection of the LSB or the USB input (RF) signal.

The unwanted sideband is never cancelled completely. A rejection of 20
dB is common in practice. The main reason to prefer the image-rejection
mixer to a (simple) mixer is noise. Let us assume that the LO frequency ωl
and the IF center frequency ωIF are given. The mixer converts both
ωIF|
and
to ωIF, while the image-rejection mixer converts only one of
these channels. Yet, the noise of the electronic circuits is present at both
frequencies.

ωl + ωIF|

Example 5 The IF ﬁlter of a FM receiver has a bandwidth of 300 kHz
centered at 10.7 MHz. In order to receive a channel at 91 MHz, we tune the
local oscillator to 101.7 MHz (101.7
10.7 = 91). A mixer down-convert
−
to IF two channels, the desired one (91 MHz) and the image frequency at
122.4 MHz (101.7 + 10.7 = 122.4). In the best case, only noise is present at
the image frequency (122.4 MHz), which is taken in by the mixer, yet not
N
by the image-rejection mixer.

SSB Modulator. The SSB modulator (Fig. 30) is a diﬀerent arrangement
of the same blocks used in the image-rejection mixer. The main purpose of
this device is to modulate a carrier by adding only one sideband, either LSB
or USB. All explanations are given on the scheme, in Fig. 30.

I-Q Detectors and Modulators. The two-axis synchronous detector in-
troduced in Section 3.2 is commercially available in (at least) two practical
implementations, shown in Fig. 32. Of course, the conversion loss is in-
creased by the loss of the input power splitter, which is of 3–4 dB. For
the same reason, the required LO power is increased by 3–4 dB. The I-Q
mixer can be reversed, operating as a modulator, as the simple mixer did

Figure 31: I-Q modulators.

(Sec. 6.1). A number of I-Q modulators are available oﬀ the shelf, shown in
Fig. 31. Other conﬁgurations of I-Q detector/modulator are possible, with
similar characteristics.

The Type-2 detector seems to work better than the Type-1 because the
180◦ junction exhibit higher symmetry and lower loss than the 90◦ junction.
Some power loss and asymmetry is more tolerated at the LO port, which is
saturated. Figure 33 gives an idea of actual loss asymmetry. In addition,
there can be a phase error, that is a deviation from quadrature, of a few
degrees.

8 Non-ideal behavior

Most of the issues discussed here resort to the general background on radio-
frequency and microwave background, for they are listed quickly only for
the sake of completeness. The book [Raz98] is a good reference.

Impedance matching.

Inputs and output of the mixer only approximate
the nominal impedance, for reﬂection are present in the circuit.
In
practice, the impedance mismatching depends on frequency and power.

48

E. Rubiola Tutorial on mixers

February 2, 2008

Isolation and crosstalk. A fraction of the input power leaks to the out-
put, and to the other input as well. Often, isolating the LO port is
relevant because of power.

1 dB compression point. At high input power, of about 10 dB below the
LO power, the mixer starts saturating, hence the SSB loss increases.
The 1 dB compression power is deﬁned as the compression power at
which the loss increases by 1 dB (Figure 14).

i + a3v3

Non-linearity. The mixer behavior deviates from the ideal linear model
of Section 3.3, for the input-output relationship is of the form vo(vi) =
a0 + a1vi + a2v2
In radio
engineering the cubic term, a3v3
i , is often the main concern. This is
due to the fact that, when two strong adjacent-channel signals are
present at ∆ω and 2∆ω oﬀ the received frequency ωi, a conversion
ωi,
product falls exactly at ωi, which causes interference. Being ∆ω
a preselector ﬁlter can not ﬁx the problem.

[Eq. (52), here repeated].

i + . . .

≪

Oﬀset.

In ‘synchronous detector’ mode, the output diﬀers from the ex-
pected value by a dc oﬀset, which depends on the LO power and of
frequency. The same problem is present in the in ‘phase detector’
mode, where also the RF power aﬀects the oﬀset. This occurs because
of saturation.

Internal phase shift. The presence of a small phase lag at each port
inside the mixer has no eﬀect in most application. Of course, in the
case of I-Q devices the quadrature accuracy is relevant.

9 Mixer Noise

The mixer noise were studied since the early time of radars [TW48, Ber58].
Signiﬁcantly lower noise was later obtained with the Schottky diode [Bar67,
Gew71], and afterwards with the double balanced mixer. More recent and
complete analysis of the mixer noise is available in [HK78a, HK78b, Ker79c,
Ker79a, Ker79b]. Nonetheless in the design electronics, and even in low-
noise electronics, the mixer noise is often a second-order issue because:

1. Nowadays mixers exhibit low noise ﬁgure, of the order of 1 dB.

2. The mixer is almost always preceded by an ampliﬁer.

3. The mixer picks up noise from a number of frequency slots sometimes

diﬃcult to predict.

Noise pick-ups from various frequency slots is probably the major practical
issue. The presence of the USB/LSB pair makes the image-rejection mixer

February 2, 2008

E. Rubiola Tutorial on mixers

49

(Fig. 29, p. 43) appealing. Two phenomena deserve attention. The ﬁrst one
is the multi-harmonic frequency conversion (Fig. 7 p. 15 and Fig. 10 p. 18),
by which noise is converted to the IF band from the sidebands of frequencies
multiple of the LO frequency. The second phenomenon is a step in the
output noise spectrum at the LO frequency, in the presence of white noise
at the RF port (Fig. 36). Only a graphical proof is given here. The output
slots IF1, IF2, and IF3 are down-converted from the input slots RF3+RF4,
RF2+RF5, and RF1+RF6, respectively. Thus, the conversion power loss
is ℓ2/2. At higher frequencies, the output slots IF4, IF5, . . . , come from
RF7, RF8, . . . , for the loss is ℓ2. The analytical proof follows exactly the
graphical proof, after increasing to inﬁnity the number of frequency slots so
that their width is dω.

Figure 36: A step appears in the conversion of white noise.

Flicker (1/f ) noise is generally not documented. All the references found
about the mixer noise are limited to classical white noise, that is, thermal
and shot noise, while the ﬂicker noise is not considered. The ﬂicker behavior
of mixer may depend on the operating mode, as listed in Table 2 (p. 7).
Yet, the general rule is that ﬂicker noise is a near-dc phenomenon, powered
by the LO pump. Then, the near-dc ﬂicker is up-converted by non-linearity
and brougt to the output; or available at the output, in the ‘synchronous
detector’ mode (Sec. 3.2) and in the ‘phase detector’ mode (Sec. 5.4), where
the dc signal is taken at the output.

10 Where to learn more

Our approach, which consists of identifying and analyzing the modes of
Table 2, is original. Thus, there are no speciﬁc references.

A lot can be learned from the data sheets of commercial mixers and from

the accompaining application notes. Unfortunately, learning in this way re-
quires patience because manufacturer tend to use their own notation, and
because of the commercial-oriented approach. Another problem is that the
analysis is often too simpliﬁed, which makes diﬃcult to ﬁt technical informa-
tion into theory. Watkins Johnson12 application notes [Hena, Henb] provide
useful general description and invaluable understanding of intermodulation
[Che]. We also found useful the Anzac [Anzb, Anza], Macom [M/A] and
Mini-Circuits [Minb, Mina] application notes.

Reading books and book chapters on mixers, one may surprised by the
diﬀerence between standpoints. A book edited by E. L. Kollberg [Kol84]
collects a series of articles, most of which published in the IEEE Transac-
tions on Microwave Theory and Technology and other IEEE Journals. This
collection covers virtually all relevant topics. The non-specialist may be in-
terested at least in the ﬁrst part, about basic mixer theory. The classical
book written by S. A. Maas [Maa93] is a must on the subject.

A few books about radio engineering contains a chapter on mixers. We
found useful chapter 3 (mixers) of McClaning & al. [MV00, pp. 261–344],
chapter 7 (Mixers) of Krauss & al. [KBR80, pp. 188–220], chapter 6 (Mixers)
of Rohde & al. [RWB96, pp. 277–318], and Chapter 7 (Microwave Mixer
Design), of Vendelin & al.[VPR90].

Some radio amateur handbooks provide experiment-oriented information
of great value, hard to ﬁnd elsewere. Transmission-line transformers and
baluns are described in [Sev01]. Recent editions of the the ARRL Hand-
book [Str99] contain a chapter on mixers (chapter 15 in the 1999 edition),
written by D. Newkirk and R. Karlquist, full of practical information and
common sense.

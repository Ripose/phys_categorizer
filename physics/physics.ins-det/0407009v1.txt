Abstract

≤

A full azimuthal φ-wedge of the ATLAS liquid argon end-cap calorimeter has been
exposed to beams of electrons, muons and pions in the energy range 6 GeV
≤
200 GeV at the CERN SPS. The angular region studied corresponds to the
E
ATLAS impact position around the pseudorapidity interval 1.6 <
< 1.8. The
beam test set-up is described. A detailed study of the performance is given as well
as the related intercalibration constants obtained. Following the ATLAS hadronic
calibration proposal, a ﬁrst study of the hadron calibration using a weighting ansatz
is presented. The results are compared to predictions from Monte Carlo simulations,
based on GEANT 3 and GEANT 4 models.

1 Introduction

The ATLAS calorimeter has to provide an accurate measurement of the energy
and position of electrons and photons, of the energy and direction of jets and
of the missing transverse energy in a given event and to provide information on
particle identiﬁcation. Previous beam runs with individual set-ups of the elec-
tromagnetic [1,2], hadronic [3] and forward calorimeters respectively provided
important information on the stand-alone calibration. They also contributed
substantially to the assessment of the production quality of the calorimeters
or modules. Only combined runs with all calorimeter types, in a set-up as
close as possible to the ﬁnal ATLAS detector, can yield calibration constants
for single pions in ATLAS. This can be transferred to ATLAS via detailed
comparison between Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and jets in ATLAS. This

tested methods and algorithms for optimal hadronic energy reconstruction
in ATLAS.

Details of the set-up, data analysis and simulations can be found in [4]. It
should be stressed that the set-up did not reproduce the exact ATLAS pro-
jective geometry. The beam was incident perpendicular to the face of the
calorimeters, rather than tilted at an angle corresponding to the ATLAS im-
pact region 1.6 <
< 1.8. This tilt angle has no major impact on the
hadronic response. For electrons the diﬀerence is more relevant. Therefore the
results given in [1] for the performance of electrons are those which can be
directly transfered to ATLAS.

2 General Set-up, Read-out and Calibration

2.1 Description of the Electromagnetic End-Cap and Hadronic End-Cap

Calorimeter

The electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter (EMEC) [1] is a liquid argon sam-
pling calorimeter with lead as absorber material. One end-cap wheel is struc-
tured in eight azimuthal wedge-shaped modules, with an inner and outer sec-
tion. The absorber plates are mounted in a radial arrangement like spokes of
a wheel, with the accordion waves running in depth parallel to the front and
back edges. The liquid argon gap increases with the radius and the accordion
wave amplitude and the related folding angle varies at each radius. In the outer
section there are 96 absorbers, segmented into three longitudinal sections. In
total there are 3888 read-out cells per module.

The presampler is placed in front of the EMEC module and it consists of two
2 mm thick active liquid argon layers, formed by three electrodes parallel to
the front face of the EMEC calorimeter.

The hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) [3]
is a liquid argon sampling
calorimeter with ﬂat copper absorber plates. The thickness of the absorber
plates is 25 mm for the front wheel (HEC1) and 50 mm for the rear wheel
(HEC2). Each wheel is made out of 32 modules. In total 24 gaps (8.5 mm)
for HEC1 and 16 gaps for HEC2 are instrumented with a read-out structure.

4

Longitudinally the read-out is segmented in 8 and 16 gaps for HEC1 and 8
and 8 gaps for HEC2. The total number of read-out channels for a φ-wedge
consisting of one HEC1 and one HEC2 module is 88.

2.2 General Beam Test Set-up

The beam tests have been carried out in the H6 beamline at the CERN SPS
providing hadrons, electrons or muons in the energy range 6 GeV
200 GeV. The general set-up is shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Schematic view of the general beam test set-up. Shown are the modules in
the cryostat as well as the beam instrumentation used.

The load in the liquid argon (LAr) cryostat consists of the outer section of
one EMEC module (1/8 of the full EMEC wheel), three HEC1 modules (3/32
of the full HEC1 wheel) and two HEC2 modules. Constrained by the cryostat
dimensions the depth of the HEC2 modules was half of the ATLAS modules.
The impact angle of beam particles was 90◦ with respect to the front plane,
yielding a non-pointing geometry of the set-up in η (vertically) unlike the AT-
LAS situation. Fig. 1 shows the location of the trigger and veto counters. The
trigger is derived from the scintillation counter B1, three scintillator walls
VM, M1, M2, and two scintillation counters F1, F2 (pretrigger, for details
see [3]) for fast timing. Up to 80 GeV the Cherenkov counter was used for the
event trigger as well. The impact position and angle of particles were derived
from four multiwire proportional chambers (MWPC) with vertical and hori-
zontal planes per chamber having 1 mm (MWPC 2, MWPC3, MWPC4) and
2 mm (MWPC5) wire spacing. The veto wall VM rejects beam halo particles;
muons are tagged using the coincidence of M1 and M2 signals. The M1 and
M2 scintillator walls are separated by an iron wall. The cryostat has an in-
ner diameter of 2.50 m, it can be ﬁlled with LAr up to a height of 2.20 m. It

the cryostat. The circular cryostat beam window has a reduced wall thickness
50 cm2
(5.5 mm stainless steel) and a diameter of 60 cm. Thus an area of 60
is available for horizontal and vertical scans. The calorimeter modules in the
cryostat are shown in Fig. 2.

The top view of the cryostat shows (from left to right) the EMEC module in-
cluding the presampler, the three HEC1 modules and the two HEC2 modules
of reduced longitudinal size. Simulation studies show that the typical leakage
for pions is at the level of 4-6 % (see section Monte Carlo simulation). Moni-
toring of the LAr purity and temperature are included in the cryostat; details
may be found in [3].

2.3 Read-out Electronics and Data Acquisition

The HEC cold front-end electronics was identical to the one used in the previ-
ous HEC stand-alone tests [3]. The output signals of the cold HEC summing
ampliﬁers as well as the raw signals from the EMEC were carried to the front-
end boards (FEB) outside the cryostat. Here the ampliﬁcation of the EMEC
signals and signal shaping of all signals was performed. The crate with the
FEB’s was directly located on the two related feedthroughs, thus extending
the Faraday cage of the cryostat. The signals were sampled and stored in the
switched capacity array of the FEB at a rate of 40 MHz. Upon arrival of the

6

trigger the FEB’s stopped the sampling, performed the digitization and sent
the data to the read-out driver (ROD) via a serial electrical link. The two types
of FEB’s used for the EMEC and HEC channels are described in refs. [1,2,3].
The read-out of the EMEC data was performed by nine MINI-ROD mod-
ules, exploited previously for the EMEC stand-alone tests [1]. The prototype
of the ATLAS ROD module (ROD-demo [5]), designed to validate the ﬁnal
ATLAS-LAr calorimetry read-out system, was used for the HEC read-out.
The ROD-demo was a 9U VME motherboard with four mezzanine processing
unit (PU) cards. Each PU processed the data from one half FEB, so in total
six PU’s on two ROD boards were used to read out the three HEC FEB’s.

The triggering and the synchronization of the nine EMEC FEB’s and the
three HEC FEB’s as well as the nine MINI-ROD’s, two ROD-demo modules
and two calibration boards was done using the TTC-0 system as employed in
the EMEC stand-alone tests [1]. In addition, a simple level converter adapted
the TTC-0 signals to the ROD-demo standard. The relative timing of the
pre-trigger (see [3] for details) with respect to the 40 MHz sampling clock
was logged by a TDC module. The beam trigger scintillation counters and
the related fast logic as well as the multiwire proportional chambers used for
tracking the beam particles were identical to those previously used in the HEC
stand-alone test [3]. The block diagram of the front-end, read-out and trigger
electronics is shown in Fig. 3.

platform. The 6U crate with the MINI-ROD modules and the 6U service crate
were placed in the EMEC control room. All other components of the system,
the 9U crate with the ROD-demo boards, the CAMAC crate with the MWPC
read-out, the 6U crate with the registers for the scintillation counters and the
event builder (CES RAID module with a RISC CPU, running the real time
system CDC EP/LX) were in the HEC control room.

2.4 Calibration and Signal Reconstruction

The signal was sampled every 25 ns. Five samplings were typically used to
reconstruct the full amplitude. For the EMEC typically 7 samplings have
been read-out. For the HEC, where due to the larger read-out cell capacities
in comparison to the EMEC a larger noise is expected, usually 16 samplings
have been used. Here the ﬁrst samplings were preceding the pulse, so the noise
could be reconstructed the same way as the signal amplitude. But for signal
shape studies even a larger number of samplings has been used.

The hardware calibration system used was the same as in the previous HEC
stand-alone beam test runs [3]. For the HEC the calibration pulse is injected
directly at the pad, for the EMEC at the motherboards. Therefore the proce-
dure used for the signal reconstruction and the prediction of the calibration
parameters was diﬀerent for the HEC and EMEC and is described brieﬂy here.

Because the optimal ﬁltering method for amplitude reconstruction [6] will be
used in ATLAS, we followed the same procedure in the beam test calibration.
A detailed knowledge of both the amplitude response and the waveform depen-
dence on the amplitude is needed. The goal of the optimal ﬁltering method is
to reconstruct the amplitude and time of a signal with a known signal shape
from discrete measurements of the signal. Thus the method minimizes the
noise contribution to the amplitude reconstruction.

To unfold the particle signal shape from the calibration signal shape an inverse
Laplace transformation has been used for the HEC and a Fourier Transfor-
mation for the EMEC. This choice is mostly driven by the diﬀerence in the
injection of the calibration pulse. For each method we stay within the tradi-
tional set of variables, e.g. s = jω, with ω being the angular frequency.

2.4.1 HEC calibration

For the HEC signal reconstruction a new procedure, compared to previous
beam test runs [3,7], was applied, using the detailed knowledge of the electronic
chain. The full response function in the beam test set-up can be written in the

time constants and α is the parameter of the calibration current shape I cal(t) =

where the ﬁrst line corresponds to the calibration generator chain (H c(s)), the
second line to the cold electronics and cables, and the third line to the warm
electronics part (H e(s)). This function cannot be generated in time domain
by directly performing an inverse Laplace transformation (ILT). Instead we
made use of the well known method of ILT for rational functions, known as
the expansion to poles, based on the fact that any rational function can be
expanded as (n > m, all poles are diﬀerent):

lytically (2 zeroes and 3 poles), and Ej during numerical ﬁtting resolving the
system of n linear equations. To be able to use the method we approximated
by substituting the triple pole for the shaper by three single poles with very
0.1 ns). The result of the ﬁt for one HEC channel is

pulse imperfections is seen, the shape is predicted again rather well (residua

Finally the transformation of the measured amplitude from voltage to current

the polynomial were computed in two steps:

the calibration signals with diﬀerent currents were transformed to triangular
signals corresponding to the same currents;

2.4.2 EMEC calibration

In comparison to the HEC, for the EMEC the electronic paths of the cali-
bration signal and of the particle-induced signal are more complicated, and
therefore a diﬀerent approach was used to calibrate the EMEC. In addition
to the main diﬀerence between the calibration pulse shape (exponential func-
tion) and the particle shape (triangle), there is also a substantial inductive
and capacitive diﬀerence between the two paths.

The particle pulse shape can be predicted from the calibration pulse shape by

11

applying two transformations, one for the current signal shape and the other
for the injection point:

H cur(s) =

I phy(s)
I cal(s)

,

(1)

(2)

where tdr is the drift time, τcal and α are parameters of the calibration current
shape, and I cal(t) = α + (1

t/τcal.

α)e−

−

In this calculation, we assume that the calorimeter read-out pad behaves as
a simple capacitor C, and that the strip-line on the detector between the
pad and the summing board (where the calibration signal is injected) can be
modeled with a series inductor L, and series resistor R. The model circuit used
in the method is shown in Fig. 6.

The method is based on a technique developed previously for the ATLAS
electromagnetic calorimeters [8,9]. The particle-induced signal pulse shape
is predicted from the calibration pulse shapes using the Fast Fourier Trans-
form (FFT) in the following steps :

•

•

•

•

•

Signal pulse shapes are obtained by averaging many pulses in each channel
in high energy pion and electron runs. Since the sampling time in each
channel is 25 ns but 1 ns bins are used in the pulse shapes, there is a set of
bin-to-bin statistical normalization constants, which are initially assumed
to be unity;
Extrapolate the calibration pulse (800 time samples) smoothly by using an
exponential function to avoid the discontinuity at the edges of the time
window, expanding the time window to 2048 time samples;
Apply a FTT to this expanded calibration pulse, to transform it into the
frequency domain;
Apply the two transformations to the calibration pulse shape in the fre-
quency domain, and then convert it to the time domain with the FFT. This
is the “predicted physics signal” in the time domain;
Calculate the free parameters (LC, RC and the drift-time) using χ-square
minimization.

The above calculation was repeated for diﬀerent signal pulse shape bin-to-bin
normalizations until the ﬁt converged.

This procedure provides a pulse shape for each channel from the calibration
signal that is suitable for use in providing optimal ﬁltering weights for analyz-
ing physics pulses in the channel. More importantly, it also gives predictions

12

for LC and RC, which are needed to compute the absolute normalization of
the signal pulses in units of ionization current using the calibration system.
All cells were not scanned during the beam test runs, and therefore there are
some cells without valid signal pulse shapes. Signal pulse shapes from cells
with similar characteristics are used for cells without a signal pulse shape.

The optimal ﬁltering coeﬃcients are applied to 5 pulse samples with 25 ns
spacing. Because the beam particles arrive at the calorimeter asynchronously
with respect to the 40 MHz clock, only a fraction of the pulses are actually
sampled near the peak. The expected reconstructed pulse height is deﬁned to
be that of an ideal continuous pulse passing through these samples. The quality
of the signal reconstruction is assessed by taking a large sample of events with
hits in a channel, and plotting the average value of the sample in a given time
bin normalized event-by-event to the reconstructed pulse height. Because this
average pulse is reconstructed for many pulses with diﬀerent sampling times,
the complete average pulse can be reconstructed with ﬁne time bins, and is
shown for one example channel in Fig. 7. If the optimal ﬁltering weights are
correct, the observed height of this normalized plot should be unity. The check
veriﬁes that the pulse height is reconstructed to better than 1 % accuracy.

are shown in Fig. 8, projected onto the front face of the three HEC1 modules.
Shown is also the related pad structure, the projection of the beam window
(circle) and the position of the calorimeter tie rods (open circles). The lower
row (G-K) corresponds roughly to an η-range of 1.51 (PS) - 1.65 (layer 3) for
the EMEC and to 1.67 (layer 1) - 1.87 (layer 3) for the HEC, the upper row (C-
F) to 1.55-1.67 (EMEC) and to 1.72-1.92 (HEC) respectively. Horizontal and
vertical scans have been performed for all particle types and at various beam
energies. In the region of the cryostat window the amount of dead material
in front of the calorimeter is minimal, about 0.6 X0 in total. To study the
variation of the response in the presampler, EMEC and HEC modules with
dead material in front, dedicated scans have been done introducing varying
amounts of additional dead material in front of the cryostat.

3.2 Electronic Noise

The optimal ﬁltering (OF) method minimizes the noise-to-signal ratio for the
signal reconstruction using the known particle signal shape and the result-
ing noise autocorrelation weights. Figs. 9 and 10 show the RMS noise of the
pedestal (using optimal ﬁltering) for the individual read-out channels of the
EMEC and HEC. For the HEC a special channel numbering has been used
(given in the Figure) to map the read-out channels i to the layer structure of

large circle indicates the beam window; the small circles the position of the tie rods

the HEC. The variation of the noise is as expected from the related channel
capacitance. For the EMEC the groups of channels in layer 0 (presampler) and
layer 1, 2 and 3 are clearly visible. For the HEC the capacitance variation that
depends on η can be seen. It is structured into individual bands related to the
corresponding longitudinal segment. For more details see [10]. For the EMEC
data only the very ﬁrst time sample is preceding the signal pulse. Therefore
the impact of the OF method on the noise has been studied using the muon
data. Here only the channels hit directly by the muon had to be excluded.
Fig. 11 shows the corresponding result for the EMEC channels. The noise is
normalized to the related pedestal RMS of the corresponding channel. From
the ﬁt a σ of about 69 % of the pedestal RMS was obtained, showing that the
OF result is somewhat worse than theoretically expected (see HEC below).
The quality of the prediction of the signal pulse shape as well as residual co-
herent noise seem to set some limitation. For the HEC data, where the ﬁrst
time samples are preceding the signal pulse, the ﬁrst ﬁve time samples have
been used to obtain the noise on an event by event basis after applying the
OF weights. Fig. 12 shows the pedestal noise of individual HEC channels as
obtained from the OF reconstruction. The noise obtained is given in units of
the pedestal RMS. The histogram shows the data, the line is a gaussian ﬁt
to the distribution. From the ﬁt a σ of about 60 % of the pedestal RMS can

3.3 Online Monitoring and Oﬄine Software

For this EMEC/HEC combined run the analysis and monitoring software
were integrated into the ATLAS object-oriented C++ ATHENA framework in
contrast to the previously used software [11]. This software package includes
tools for decoding the online data, building data ’objects’, storing them in the
ATHENA transient data store, and ﬁnally developing all analysis tools within
the ATHENA framework. This new software package has many beneﬁts. In
particular, the software being developed for beam test calibration, monitoring
and analysis will be directly available for analysing eventual ATLAS data, en-
couraging the transfer of expertise from the detector groups leading the beam
test eﬀort into the oﬄine software and analysis. The implementation of the
beam test analysis into ATHENA, its ﬁrst application to real data, is currently
driving a number of signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the ATLAS software and anal-
ysis framework. These modiﬁcations include many features allowing ATHENA
to cope with real conditions such as imperfect time varying data with chang-
ing calibration constants and detailed event data content. The EMEC/HEC
combined beam test was the ﬁrst use of ATHENA for beam test analysis, and
the expertise gained in this eﬀort is being carried forward into upcoming beam
tests and oﬄine analysis.

3.4 Global Event Timing

In contrast to the ATLAS situation at the LHC, the trigger in the beam test is
asynchronous with respect to the 40 MHz clock. The relative timing between
the clock and the trigger can be deﬁned using either the TDC information or
it can be derived from global event timing. From a 3rd order polynomial ﬁt to
the signal shape of an individual channel i with a signiﬁcant pulse height the
‘cubic time’ ti can be derived. Mainly due to diﬀerences in cabling the timing
3 ns for the
of individual channels varies by up to
±
HEC. These channel oﬀsets have been deﬁned from a global ﬁt minimizing the
channel-to-channel time diﬀerences for all EMEC and HEC channels over all
electron and pion runs. Knowing these oﬀsets ∆ti ﬁnally a ’global cubic time’
for each event can be determined with:

channel with the largest signal over all runs. The precision of the global time
tglobal is better than 1.5 ns. The slight oﬀset from zero might be partially
related to the time evolution of the shower development, which is for the
hottest channel the shower core and for other channels more in the shower
tail.

3.5 Cluster Algorithm

A cluster algorithm has been developed to reconstruct the energy of the beam
particle. In each layer the topological neighbours of a given cell are considered:
they have to share at least one common corner. A seed is chosen if the energy
is signiﬁcantly above the noise: Eseed > 4σnoise. The general cut-oﬀ at the cell
> 2σnoise, the cluster is expanded with neighbours of all cells
level is
|
> 3σnoise. Symmetric cuts have been chosen in order
satisfying
to avoid major energy oﬀsets due to noise pick-up. Fig. 14 shows the read-
out cells of a typical 148 GeV electron event: in total there are four EMEC
clusters (one per layer) and no HEC clusters with 83 channels in total. Due to
the non pointing geometry and the diﬀerent cluster algorithm used, the cluster

the beam impact point; the scale is given in nA.

The colour code indicates the related signal height of the individual read-out
cells. The cluster algorithm proves to be very eﬃcient for the reconstruction
of the particle energy deposited and avoids including too much noise in the
particle signal.

3.6 Alignment

In ATLAS the three sub-detectors EMEC, HEC1 and HEC2 form three wheels,
which are placed in one common cryostat. In the beam test set-up the relative
positions of the three sub-detectors follow the ATLAS dimensions within tol-
erance (typically tolerances are < 3 mm). Nevertheless, to be able to simulate
details of the shower formation and cluster reconstruction, a precise horizontal
and vertical alignment of the sub-detectors is required. Using the track recon-
struction based on the MWPC data, the signal response in the EMEC, HEC1
and HEC2 can be closely followed in horizontal and vertical scans. Module and
pad boundaries as well as tie-rod positions can be used to extract the required
information with high precision. As an example, Figs. 17 and 18 show the
relative response for pions of 200 GeV in the second EMEC layer and in the
second HEC1 layer when running a horizontal scan. Plotted is in each case the
ratio between the maximum signal cell response and the corresponding cluster
energy. The pad boundaries are clearly visible. Using the combined informa-
tion of all these data, the precision of the relative alignment is typically at the
level of
1 mm. In Fig. 18 the lateral energy leakage is visible when the beam
impact approaches the outer modules: the related cluster energy is reduced.

3.7 High Voltage Corrections for Central HEC1 Module

In the second longitudinal segment of the central HEC1 module during the
run one of the 4 HV lines, which are feeding the four sub-gaps of this section,
had to be disconnected because of a short. The related correction 4/3 has
been applied to those data. As the signal is still measured correctly in three
out of four sub-gaps, all ﬂuctuations of the hadronic shower are measured
correctly as well. The main consequence due to this HV short is a reduced
signal to noise ratio only. The horizontal scans with pions revealed a particular
problem in the second longitudinal segment of the central HEC1 module: in
particular for pions that started early showering, the response was weaker than
normally. Fig. 19 shows for 200 GeV pions from a horizontal scan the ratio of
the average energy deposited in the 2nd longitudinal segment of the central
HEC1 module over the average energy deposited in the same longitudinal
segment but in the outer HEC1 modules and for diﬀerent beam impact points,
as function of the asymmetry of the total energy depositions in the 1st and
3rd (last) longitudinal segments (the last longitudinal segment being HEC2).
The eﬀect is clearly visible and well reproduced by the MC simulation. As
seen in the MC distributions, even the position of the disconnected gap can
be inferred within limits, even though it is not really required. Aﬀected were
gaps at the very beginning of the 2nd longitudinal segment. After the run
this problem could be partially traced back to bad ground connections of
the EST boards in this region of the central HEC1 module. To correct the

data, the observed asymmetry has been determined from a ﬁt (line). The
result of this ﬁt has been used for corrections. Thus the data have been used
directly to correct for the eﬀect observed without any further MC assumptions.
Repeating this analysis for 30 GeV pions shows that this correction is rather
energy independent. In consequence, this correction on an event-by-event basis
takes care to a large extent of ﬂuctuations in the energy deposition and thus
also improves the energy resolution. This shows clearly Fig. 20: the energy
resolution σ/E for 200 GeV pions (electromagnetic scale) improves typically
from σ/E = (8.97

0.12) % to σ/E = (8.61

4 Monte Carlo Simulation

In ATLAS the ﬁnal hadronic calibration is driven by jets rather than single
particles. Following a weighting approach for the hadronic calibration [12]
in ATLAS, weighting parameters are deﬁned relative to the electromagnetic
scale, which can be well deﬁned in ATLAS as well as in the beam test set-
up. These parameters have to be derived from MC studies. Therefore it is
important that the MC describes the data well and the comparison of data
with MC in the beam test is of utmost importance. Thus special software
packages have been developed.

The ﬁrst package uses the GEANT 3 program [13] (version 3.21) to simulate
the response of various beam particles in the EMEC and HEC. The geometry
description is very detailed: cryostat, liquid argon excluder, all beam elements
(MWPC’s, scintillation counters etc.) as well as all details of the calorimeter
modules are included. This code is based on the development done for the
HEC stand-alone tests [14]. For the hadronic shower simulation the GCALOR
code [15] is used. For particle tracking the threshold has been set to 100 keV
and for secondary production of photons and electrons to 1 MeV.

The second package uses the GEANT 4 code [16], developed by a worldwide
collaboration, and since the ﬁrst release in 1999 maintained by the interna-
tional GEANT 4 collaboration. The implementation of the ATLAS detector
including the calorimeters is still ongoing. Within this process the validation
of the physics models in GEANT 4 is one of the most important tasks. From
the proposed physics lists [17] for hadronic shower simulations in GEANT 4
two models have been selected for the comparison of the data with MC: LHEP
and QGSP. The LHEP physics list uses the low and high energy pion param-
eterisation models for inelastic scattering. The QGSP physics list is based on
theory driven models: it uses the quark-gluon string model for interactions
and a pre-equilibrium decay model for the fragmentation. The geometrical
description of the set-up is at the same level of detail as in GEANT 3. The
range threshold for production has been set to 700 µm in general, irrespective
of the material. This corresponds to cut-oﬀ energies of 1.03 MeV, 1.00 MeV
and 0.27 MeV for copper, lead and liquid argon respectively.

The response signals from MC simulations and data have to be compared at
a well-deﬁned scale. For the MC the inverse sampling ratio is used, that is the
ratio between the electron beam energy and the total visible energy. For the
HEC this ratio has been obtained from the HEC stand alone simulations as
23.3 (23.7) for GEANT 3 (GEANT 4) respectively. Simulations of the com-
bined EMEC/HEC beam test runs have been used to obtain this ratio for the
EMEC. The corresponding values are 11.35 (12.05) for GEANT 3 (GEANT 4)
respectively. The beam test set-up causes some lateral and longitudinal leakage

27

for hadronic showers. To evaluate the amount of leakage and its inﬂuence on
the calorimeter performance, ‘virtual’ leakage detectors, placed laterally and
longitudinally with respect to the EMEC and HEC modules, have been imple-
mented in the simulations. In these ‘detectors’ the kinetic energy is summed
up for all particles leaving the calorimeter modules via the related module
boundaries. Figs. 21, 22 and 23 show the average fraction of energy leaking
with respect to the beam energy for charged pions (π−) of diﬀerent energies.
Shown are the results for the three MC models considered. At low energies the
lateral leakage dominates, at high energies the longitudinal leakage increases.
The amount of total energy leakage diﬀers somewhat for the various MC op-
tions: GEANT 3 predicts about 6 %, while GEANT 4 QGSP gives 4 % leakage.
The energy dependence of leakage is in both options rather weak. GEANT 4
LHEP is in agreement with GEANT 3 at high energies, but yields somewhat
smaller leakage at low energies.

The simulation of the noise uses real data (see section electronic noise). For
the EMEC the noise has been obtained from the muon data, excluding the
channels hit directly by the muon. For the HEC the ﬁrst time samples are
preceding the signal pulse and have been used to derive the σ of the noise
distribution.

5 Electron Results

The main goal of this beam test is the determination of the hadronic cali-
1.8. The
bration – constants and procedures – in the ATLAS region of
analysis of the pion data is of most relevance for this task. Nevertheless, to be
able to assess the performance of the EMEC and to obtain the electromagnetic
scale, which is the basis for the hadronic calibration, the analysis of electrons
is the initial step in this project. As already discussed this beam test set-up
geometry is slightly non-projective, in contrast to the ATLAS detector. Thus
the deﬁnitive reference for the performance of electrons in ATLAS is [1] rather
than this paper. As it turns out the electron results obtained in this beam test
are in close agreement to the previous analysis [1].

5.1 Corrections

The end-cap geometry of the EMEC requires small corrections [1] for the
energy reconstruction of electrons. The projective HV sectors yield a variation
of the signal response with η (corresponding to R in the beam test geometry).
Given the limited η range accessible in the beam test set-up and the non-
pointing geometry, where the beam spread covers a larger η range than in
the pointing geometry, this variation on average is smaller in comparison to
the azimuthal φ variation and has been ignored. However, electric ﬁeld and
sampling fraction non-uniformities as well as the non-pointing geometry, cause
a signiﬁcant φ variation of the signal response. Fig. 24 shows the relative
response of 119 GeV electrons as function of φ in cell units. Here Erun is the
average energy obtained for the corresponding run. A variation at the level
1.5 % can be seen. A numerical correction deﬁned bin by bin has been
of
used for the data correction.

5.2 Energy Resolution

The energy resolution has been studied using the cluster algorithm with the
corrections mentioned above. As an example Fig. 25 shows the energy resolu-
tion for impact point I. The data have not been corrected for energy deposi-
tions outside the reconstructed cluster. The data are shown with the noise sub-
tracted. The noise contribution is shown as well. A ﬁt to the data (solid line)

Further tuning is underway for ATLAS to improve the fair agreement with
the data. For example the amplitude of the φ modulation is twice as big in
GEANT 4 as in GEANT 3 and the data. Due to the beam spread this vari-
ation is corrected as for the data (see section Corrections). This causes some
systematic uncertainty in the MC prediction due to the exact beam impact
position and beam spread. Since the impact angle for the combined beam
test is diﬀerent from the geometry of the pointing EMEC stand-alone beam
test [1], the energy resolution is slightly worse compared to the sampling term

of
EMEC analysis.

The energy resolution has been studied for various impact points. Fig. 26 shows
the sampling term for various impact points and Fig. 27 the constant term.
Because of the residual weak correlation between the constant term and the
sampling term some care has to be taken when comparing the various points.

Also shown is the noise contribution at the various energies. The line shows the
result of the ﬁt to the data.

Nevertheless, the diﬀerences (left and right set of points) seem to indicate
some η-dependence. Partially this is related to the η-variation of the sampling
fraction and also to the weak η-dependence of the electric ﬁeld, which has not
been taken into account.

5.3 Linearity and Electromagnetic Scale

To obtain the electromagnetic scale one has to correct for the energy deposited
outside the reconstructed cluster. For electrons the leakage beyond the detec-
tor boundaries is known from the MC to be negligible. The energy lost outside
the reconstructed cluster can easily be obtained both for data and MC. For the
energy leaking into the HEC, the electromagnetic scale of the HEC1 measured

except for low energies. Both MC models show a somewhat smaller leakage,
especially at low energies. This might be due to small eﬀects of dead material
in front of the EMEC or some cross-talk eﬀects in the EMEC, which are not
fully described in the MC.

5.4 Variation of the Response and Resolution with Material in front of the

EMEC.

In ATLAS the amount of dead material in front of the calorimeter varies with
η. The response in the presampler will be used to correct for the energy loss of
electrons in this dead material. Therefore in this beam test electron data have
been taken varying the amount of dead material in front of the cryostat. From
this data presampler corrections to the measured electron energy in EMEC
can be studied. The main goal of the correction is to achieve a good linearity
of the electron signal, but in parallel a substantial improvement of the resolu-
tion can be obtained. Fig. 30 shows the dependence of the missing energy on
the presampler signal for electrons of 10, 20, 119 and 148 GeV with 2.73 X0 in
front of the cryostat. A 4th order polynomial ﬁt (solid line) to the data yields
a good description of the dependence for a wide range of presampler signals
and for all energies considered. Fig. 31 shows the ratio of the reconstructed
energy relative to the beam energy as function of presampler signal for the
data before (open points) and after (solid points) the correction. Again, the
data for all energies studied are shown. For a wide range of presampler signals
and for all energies considered the linearity of the electron signal is recovered.
Finally Fig. 32 shows the response of electrons of 10, 20, 119 and 148 GeV
before (dashed histogram) and after (solid histogram) the presampler correc-
tions to the EMEC energy. Also given for each energy is the ratio of energy
resolution relative to the resolution without any extra dead material in front
of the cryostat: R = [σ/E]2.73 X0 /[σ/E]0 X0. The dramatic improvement of the
resolution is clearly visible: it is close to a factor of two, in particular at higher
energies.

It should be mentioned that an energy dependent correction could slightly
improve the results. These studies, as well as the dependence on the amount
of extra dead material in front, are still ongoing as part of the ATLAS energy
calibration studies. However it was the goal of this analysis to restrict the
corrections to a rather general and robust approach which can be further
reﬁned for ATLAS.

6.1 Response at the Electromagnetic Scale

em

The energy reconstruction of pions is based on the electromagnetic scale. For
the EMEC value αEMEC
= 0.430 MeV/nA (see section electrons) has been
used, whereas for the HEC the results from electron data taken in the pre-
vious stand-alone beam test runs [3] have been used. With respect to [3] a
correction for the calibration pulse shape had to be applied, ﬁnally yielding
em = 3.27 MeV/nA. The statistical (systematic) error of αHEC
a value of αHEC
em
is typically 1 % (1 %). As an example, Figs. 33, 34 and 35 show the energy
response in the EMEC, HEC and the total response respectively to 200 GeV
pions at the impact point J. The data are compared with the MC predictions.
Both, GEANT 3 and GEANT 4 QGSP describe the EMEC and HEC data
reasonably well, even though there are some deviations visible. In contrast,
the GEANT 4 LHEP simulation deviates substantially from the data both,
for the EMEC and the HEC. However the GEANT 4 LHEP simulation yields
the best agreement with data for the total signal.

6.2 Energy Reconstruction using the Cluster Weighting Approach

In the ATLAS calorimeter the response to hadrons diﬀers signiﬁcantly from
that for electrons of the same energy. Therefore, for hadronic energy a cali-
bration coeﬃcient has to be applied to the signals determined on the corre-
sponding electromagnetic scale. The goal is to get an equal response for the
electromagnetic as well as the pure hadronic component of a hadronic shower.
If this goal were to be achieved ﬂuctuations in the reconstructed hadronic
shower energy could be minimized and thus the energy resolution substan-
tially improved. The technique of signal weighting has been successfully used
in previous experiments (see [18,19] and the references therein). It exploits the
fact that local energy deposits of high density are mainly due to electromag-
netic interactions while for hadronic interactions the corresponding density is
substantially lower. Thus for a segmented calorimeter the energy deposited in
individual read-out cells can be on a statistical basis identiﬁed to be of elec-
tromagnetic or hadronic origin. For the hadronic calibration of the ATLAS
calorimeter a similar approach is envisaged [12]. Methods and algorithms are
still under development. The goal is to use weighting constants and weighting
functions, based on the individual cluster energy, to reconstruct optimally the
related energy. In ATLAS these weighting constants have to be derived from

Fig. 35. Total response to 200 GeV pions in the EMEC and HEC on the electro-
magnetic scale. The data are compared to MC predictions.

MC simulations, which to validate the method have to describe the beam test
data well. The crucial MC information in this tuning process is the knowl-
edge of the total and visible energy deposition in each read-out cell. Thus the
weights could be directly derived from the MC simulation and applied to beam
test data. At present this MC information is not yet available. Hence a weight-
ing approach based on individual read-out cell energy deposits as envisaged
cannot yet be achieved. Therefore a diﬀerent approach has been applied.

In the EMEC and the HEC the volume of the related clusters can be used
to obtain the ’EMEC cluster energy density’ and the ’HEC cluster energy
density’. Here the cluster volume is the sum of all volumes of the individual
cells contained in the cluster. With this information a correction to the elec-
tromagnetic scale can be derived using the information of the total energy
in the EMEC and HEC on the beam energy scale. To obtain an estimate of
the ‘true’ energy deposited, the energy leakage has to be subtracted from the
beam energy. Energy may leak for two reasons:

Energy deposited in the detector, but outside of the reconstructed cluster;
Energy leaking outside the detector set-up.

•
•

The leakage outside the cluster has been obtained for each event by adding

42

the energies (electromagnetic scale) of all readout cells not used in the cluster
reconstruction. On average the noise contributions, being symmetric, cancel.
Fig. 36 shows the energy dependence of this ’cluster leakage’. At low energy it
rises up to 5 GeV and remains approximately at this level for energies above
60 GeV. The GEANT 4 MC prediction shows a somewhat smaller leakage, the
GEANT 3 prediction is closer to the data but diﬀers in shape.

Fig. 36. Energy dependence of the average energy leakage outside the reconstructed
cluster for pions. Shown are the data and the diﬀerent MC expectations.

To estimate the energy leakage outside the detector for each event, the MC
prediction (GEANT 4 QGSP) has been used. Here the predicted correlation
between the energy density (EMEC and HEC) and the energy leakage has been
used. Figs. 37 and 38 show this correlation for 200 GeV pions at a particular
impact point as an example. In particular for the EMEC the correlation is
rather pronounced: whenever the energy density is low, leakage is getting
large, separating more electromagnetic from hadronic interactions. This total
leakage is on average (see section on Monte Carlo simulation) at the level of
4 %.

To demonstrate this procedure 30 GeV pions which have deposited all their
energy in the EMEC have been selected. Fig. 39 shows the ratio wEMEC of the
‘true’ deposited energy over the measured energy on the electromagnetic scale
as a function of energy density in the EMEC. The data can be well described
using the parameterisation:

wEMEC = C1 exp (

C2Eem/V ) + C3

where Eem refers to the EMEC cluster energy in the em scale and V to the
corresponding cluster volume. The ﬁt describes the data well. The weighting
parameters Ci from the ﬁt have been applied to the data. Fig. 40 shows the
energy resolution thus obtained: weighting improves the energy resolution from
σ/E = 26.2 % to σ/E = 15.1 %. The average measured energy is less than
30 GeV because some energy is deposited outside the cluster reconstructed
(Eleak).

For higher energies both subdetectors, the EMEC and the HEC, have to be
considered. Here a χ2-ﬁt has been used to determine the parameters Ci:

of all calorimeter read-out cells, which are not included in the clusters. This
value has been found to be rather independent of the cluster size and of the
beam energy; therefore it is set to the average value of 5 GeV. The χ2 has been
deﬁned based on noise contributions only, neglecting shower ﬂuctuations. To
a large extent they drop out because of the correlation between Ereco

pion compensation on an event by event basis is non-gaussian and we attribute
it to the systematic error of the method used. It has been neglected in the χ2
deﬁnition above. But the χ2 per d.o.f. achieved is typically 3.5, indicating a
reasonable χ2 deﬁnition.

Figs. 41 and 42 show the results for pions of 200 GeV. Shown is again the ratio
of the true energy relative to the measured energy on the electromagnetic scale
for both, the EMEC (wEMEC) and the HEC (wHEC) compared with the three
MC models.

The line shows the result of the ﬁt to the data using the parameterisation given
above 3. The corresponding ﬁts to the MC data have been also performed.
Because of the rather strong correlation between C1 and C2, C2 has been set
to a constant value (C2 = 1000 cm3/GeV for EMEC and C2 = 1500 cm3/GeV
for HEC). It turned out that leaving C2 as free parameter hardly improved
the χ2 of the ﬁt. In the EMEC the energy densities are well described by both
GEANT 4 options, in contrast to GEANT 3; in the HEC the GEANT 4 models
are close to the data, but far from being optimal. The two GEANT 4 models
QGSP and LHEP describe the energy densities equally well, but GEANT 3
is substantially worse. The parameterisation mentioned above describes the
EMEC as well as the HEC weights for the individual data sets over a large

The energy dependence of all parameters shows no dramatic variation, so a
parameterization of the energy dependence could easily be implemented. As
expected C3 approaches unity as given by the electromagnetic scale. Devia-
tions from 1 are due to residual correlations with C1, systematic errors in the
determination of the electromagnetic scale or due to systematic errors in sig-
nal reconstruction, calibration and HV-correction. As seen in the data these
contributions are rather small, both for the EMEC and the HEC. In ATLAS
the in situ determination of C3 with single particles can yield a powerful cross-
check not only of the electromagnetic scale of the EMEC, which is well deﬁned
e+e− decays, but also the more diﬃcult to determine
from analysing e.g. Z
electromagnetic scale of the HEC.

→

Some care has to be taken when comparing the Ci’s of the data with MC
predictions. The correlations between the individual parameters can result in
rather diﬀerent energy dependencies, yielding nevertheless a similar energy
dependence of the weights. Therefore for the MC not only C2 has been kept
identical to the data (and ﬁxed, see above), but also C3 has been set to the
value obtained from the ﬁt to the data. In consequence, C1 will reﬂect fully
any deviation of the MC from the data, up to a very weak residual correlation
of C EMEC
. This approach has been chosen only to reveal clearly any
1
diﬀerences between data and the various MC models. Figs. 45 and 46 show the
results for C EMEC
. Only π− interactions have been simulated in the
MC. All MC models follow the general trend of the data, but the diﬀerences
are signiﬁcant. The GEANT 3 predictions deviate strongly from the HEC data
and for the EMEC data none of the MC models can be preferred.

clearly visible. The lines show the results of the ﬁts to the data.

Finally the data have been compared with MC predictions. Fig. 49 shows the

6.4 e/π-Ratio

Using the weighting scheme an ’eﬀective’ e/π-ratio, the ratio between the
electron and pion response, for the combined set-up EMEC/HEC can be ex-
tracted. Fig. 50 shows this ratio for the data and for the diﬀerent MC models.
The energy dependence is in all cases rather similar. However the MC pre-
dictions are substantially below the data, with GEANT 3 being especially
low. From the energy dependence of the electromagnetic component of the
hadronic shower an e/h-ratio can be obtained [3,20,21]. The results are using
the parameterization [21] e/h = 1.56
0.01
0.01
for GEANT 3, e/h = 1.48
for GEANT 4 QGSP. The errors are purely statistical. With the energy depen-
dence being rather similar in all cases, the ’intrinsic e/h-ratio’ reﬂects closely

6.5 Energy Reconstruction using the Read-out Cell Weighting Approach

The energy weighting approach on the cluster level described above yields
acceptable results for the case of single particles in beam tests. However in
ATLAS the hadronic calibration requires the calibration of the calorimeter
based on jet interactions. Here the heavy overlap of many particles dramati-
cally reduces the power of distinction between hadronic and electromagnetic
energy deposits based on cluster energy density criteria. Therefore for ATLAS
a weighting approach based on the read-out cell level is envisaged [12]. The op-

55

p
timal procedure would be to obtain these weights from MC simulation, where
on the read-out cell level the energy deposits in active and passive material are
known. Lacking the MC instruments (presently in development) an approach
using the data only has been tried. The basic idea is to obtain weights for
individual bins of energy densities ρi in the EMEC and HEC by minimizing:

An important aspect is to correct for the energy leakage prior to minimizing
the χ2, because the energy leakage can aﬀect χ2 more than any diﬀerence in
the electron to pion response of the calorimeter. The number of parameters
determined in the ﬁt was typically N = 26 for EMEC and N = 26 for the HEC
(25 bins in each energy weighting histogram, plus one overﬂow bin). Figs. 51
and 52 show the results obtained for the weights wi for the EMEC and HEC
for pions of 200 GeV.

The method to extract the weights directly from the data rather than using
the MC has a drawback: the weights obtained from the ﬁt are to some extent
correlated and reﬂect more than the pure e to π compensation. Fig. 53 shows
the correlation coeﬃcients between the individual weights for the 2 sets of 26
weights obtained from the ﬁt for pions of 200 GeV. The two sets of EMEC and
HEC weights are uncorrelated. But there is a sizeable anti-correlation between
the weights for low densities and all other energy densities for the individual
EMEC and HEC sets of weights. The sensitivity of this method to even very
small imperfections is a severe limitation. This can be demonstrated nicely
by applying the method to electrons. Fig. 54 shows the weights obtained in
this case for electrons of 148 GeV. Again, the weights at low energy densities
deviate from the nominal electromagnetic scale, and are anti-correlated with
the corresponding weights at high energy densities. Fig. 55 shows the energy
distribution for electrons of 148 GeV using the nominal electromagnetic scale
(solid histogram) and the cell weights (dashed histogram). The actual energy
distribution is hardly changed at all. The correlation coeﬃcients for the cell
weights are shown in Fig. 56.

6.6 Energy Resolution using the Read-out Cell Weighting Approach

The energy resolution for pions has been determined using the read-out cell
weighting approach. Fig. 57 shows the energy dependence of the energy reso-
lution obtained. The electronic noise contribution has been again subtracted,
but is shown explicitly. Using the parameterisation σ(E)

6.7 Impact of Hadronic Weights on Energy of Electromagnetic Clusters

In the weighting approach for the hadronic calibration it has to be guaranteed
that even clusters with almost pure electromagnetic energy are reconstructed
at the correct energy scale. To test this, electrons have been reconstructed
using the hadronic weights. Figs. 58 and 59 show the energy distributions for
electrons of 100 GeV using the cluster weighting and read-out cell weighting
approach (weights deﬁned from pions, dashed histogram) respectively com-
pared to the normal (electromagnetic scale, solid histogram) reconstruction.

In both cases the mean energy is obtained correctly, but the resolution is dete-
riorated. The requirement, not to distort the electromagnetic energy scale, is
important for any weighting approach to be applied to clusters in the ATLAS
calorimeter. Therefore any algorithm developed to compensate for the diﬀerent
e/π response in the ATLAS calorimeter has to fulﬁll this requirement.

E = a

Results of calibration runs with electrons and pions in the ATLAS end-cap
= 1.6-
calorimeter corresponding to the region in pseudorapidity around
1.8 in ATLAS have been presented. The electromagnetic calibration constants
have been determined for both subdetectors, the EMEC as well as the HEC.
First steps of the ATLAS hadronic calibration strategy have been tested. The
signal weighting approach, as used in previous experiments, improves the pion
energy resolution substantially: using the ansatz σ(E)
b a sampling term
80 %√GeV can be achieved and a vanishing constant term b.
of typically a
For ATLAS the hadronic calibration has to deal with jets rather than single
particles. Therefore the transfer of weighting constants from the beam test
to ATLAS is only possible when using MC simulation. One of the important
steps in this procedure is to validate the MC via comparison of the simulation
results with pion data. This has been initiated in detail using GEANT 3 and
GEANT 4 simulations. In general GEANT 4 yields the better description of
the data, but not yet at the level required. Whereas the agreement of the
GEANT 4 prediction with data for the response at the electromagnetic scale
is rather good, GEANT 4 fails to describe the details of hadronic shower
ﬂuctuations at the level required to apply weighting techniques. Here further
improvements of GEANT 4 parameters and processes are required.

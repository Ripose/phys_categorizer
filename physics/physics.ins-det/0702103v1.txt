LHCb Level-0 Trigger Detectors

Abstract

The calorimeter and muon systems are essential components to provide a trigger
for the LHCb experiment. The calorimeter system comprises a scintillating pad de-
tector and pre-shower, followed by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The
calorimeter system allows photons, electrons and hadrons to be identiﬁed, and their
energy to be measured. The muon system consists of ﬁve measuring stations equipped
with Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs) and triple-Gas Electron Multi-
plier (GEM) detectors, separated by iron ﬁlters. It allows the muons identiﬁcation
and transverse momentum measurement. The status of the two systems and their
expected performance is presented.

1 Introduction

The LHCb experiment is dedicated
to the study of the decays of beauty
hadrons produced at the LHC. Pre-
cision measurements of CP violation
and rare decays in the B meson
systems, which are the main LHCb
goals, can be achieved only with
a very well designed and eﬃcient
trigger[1].
A key role in the trigger is played by
the Level-0 (L0) hardware step that
reduces the event rate from 40MHz
to 1MHz using the input from the
VELO[2] detector, the calorimeter

Design performances have been opti-
mized in order to allow a fast recon-
struction of high transverse energy
(ET , CALO system) or high trans-
verse momentum (PT , MUON sys-
tem) candidates needed by the L0
decision unit (L0DU).

The active elements are scintillating
tiles, read out via wave-length shift-
ing ﬁbres to photo-multipliers. The
scintillator is interleaved with lead
for the electromagnetic calorimeter
in a Shashlik construction, while for
the hadronic calorimeter it is inter-
leaved with steel tiles.
All these subdetectors are charac-
terised by a pseudo-projective ge-
ometry achieved using a variable
detector module granularity.

2.1 Scintillating pad detector and

pre-shower

The SPD and PS detectors are used
to distinguish electrons from pions
and photons (SPD), photons from
Minimum Ionizing Particles and to
veto busy events with a very high
charged multiplicity (SPD).
The SPD/PS system is made from
a lead converter plate (14mm thick)
that is sandwiched between two lay-
ers of scintillator pads (15mm thick).
The light collected is read from
a Multi-Anode PhotoMulTiplier
(MAPMT) and sent to a Front-End
card (VFE).

2.2 Electromagnetic calorimeter

The electromagnetic calorimeter is
used to measure the electron, pho-
ton and pion ET . It provides particle
identiﬁcation (PID) and reconstruc-
tion information for the particles
used in oﬄine analysis.
It consists of nearly 3k Shashlik mod-
ules, for a total of 6k detector cells,

3 Muon system

The LHCb muon system [4] is com-
posed of ﬁve tracking stations, each
subdivided in four concentric re-
gions, which comprise 1368 MWPCs
and 24 triple GEM detectors. The
muon detector is required to have a
high detection eﬃciency and a good
spatial and time resolution.
The geometry is projective: the lay-
out has been optimized by choos-
ing an x, y granularity that added
a contribution to the PT resolution
nearly equal to that from the mul-
tiple scattering. The ﬁnal layout is
composed of 20 diﬀerent pad sizes

3.1 Triple GEM detectors

Triple GEM detectors[5] are going to
be used only in the innermost region
of the ﬁrst station, where the particle
rate is expected to be the highest.
Those chambers are characterised
by a high rate capability, a high sta-
tion eﬃciency (greater than 96% in
20ns time window) and a low clus-
ter size (less than 1.2). The achieved
time resolution is 3ns when using
an Ar/CO2/CF4 gas mixture of
45%/15%/40%.

3.2 MWPC

The MWPCs used in the muon sys-
tem are composed of double gas gaps
that are further logically OR-ed: this
will ensure a high hit detection ef-
ﬁciency and enhance the detector
robustness.

triggering

In order to meet the performance
required for
and for
physics analysis, each double-gap
95%,
should have an eﬃciency
within a 20ns time window, a clus-
1.1, as well as good age-
ter size
ing properties. These performances
were measured, using a MIP test
beam, as a function of the high
voltage (HV) applied to the wires,
using an Ar/CO2/CF4 gas mix-
ture of 40%/50%/10%. The results
reported in Fig.2 show that the
above conditions are satisﬁed for
2700V.

MWPCs are read out with a custom
radiation hard chip (named CAR-
IOCA) that works as an ampliﬁer,
shaper and discriminator charac-
terised by a 10ns peak time. Cham-

4 L0 trigger

The L0 hardware trigger[1] is fully
synchronous, it has a ﬁxed latency
(4µs) and reduces the 40MHz inter-
action rate to 1MHz. The L0 De-
cision Unit (L0DU) takes as input:
(from the CALO) the highest ET
candidate for each type (e, γ, π0), the
total measured energy, the charged
multiplicity and (from the MUON)
the two highest PT candidates per
quadrant. An eﬃciency of 30-50% is
achieved for the hadronic channels
(accounting for about 700kHz band-
width) while the muon channels are
selected with 90% eﬃciency.

5 Conclusion

The LHCb CALO and MUON sys-
tems are currently under installation
and are going to be ready for the
data taking start in July 2007. The
calorimeter construction is now al-
most completed, and more than half
of the required muon chambers have
been produced. The muon ﬁlters are
already in place while the support
wall is being built. Test beam data
showed that the design values have
been achieved: detectors timing and
resolution performances are very
good. The L0 hardware trigger de-
sign has been ﬁnalized: the obtained
eﬃciencies for hadronic, muonic and
radiative channels are expected to be
30–50%, 90% and 70% respectively.

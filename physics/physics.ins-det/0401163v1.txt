Abstract

This paper deals with the use of a magnetic levitation system as a part of a
multi-stage seismic attenuator for gravitational wave interferometric antennas. The
proposed conﬁguration uses permanent magnets in attraction to balance the sus-
pended weight, plus a closed loop position control to obtain a stable levitation. The
system is analyzed using a MATLAB simulation code to compute the forces exerted
by extended magnets. The validity of this model has been tested by a comparison
with the experimental data from a levitated suspension prototype.

upgrade of the sophisticated suspensions used in long baseline interferometric
Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors like, for example, Virgo [5].

The detection of GW is one of the most challenging ﬁelds of contemporary
physics [6,7] and interferometers appear to be the most promising detectors
looking for the ﬁrst direct evidence of GW. Presently, several long baseline
antennas have already started operation [8,9,10], or are still under construction
[5,11]. Due to the extreme weakness of the GW signals, the main requirement
for these detectors is the isolation of the optical components – used as free-
falling test masses – from any kind of external disturbance. For this reason, the
whole optical path (e.g. three km per arm for Virgo) is under ultra high vacuum
and all the mirrors are suspended to complex vibration isolation systems,
which strongly reduce the eﬀect of seismic vibration, that is the main limiting
noise below few Hz.

The idea of using stable levitation for the mirror suspensions of long baseline
GW detectors has been proposed by Drever [12] for magnetic levitation, and
Giazotto [13] for electrostatic levitation. The main advantage of these systems
is the possibility to hold the mirror without direct contact; therefore, these
conﬁgurations avoid some noise contributions due to the presence of suspen-
sion wires – for example the thermal noise associated with violin modes.

In the case of magnetic levitation, the presence of big magnets directly at-
tached to the mirrors would decrease the mechanical quality factor of the in-
ternal modes, thus increasing the associated thermal noise, and should make
the mirror position directly sensitive to external electro-magnetic (EM) noise.
On the other hand, using an electrostatic levitation system is safe from the
point of view of the mirror quality factor.

To obtain a stable levitation, it is necessary to use a servo-loop to control the
vertical position of the mirror. In this case, the noise of the position sensor
should be low enough, in order not to spoil the sensitivity of the antenna.
For example, for the Virgo interferometer a sensitivity of 10−17 m/√Hz at
10 Hz is expected. Assuming a (optimistic) vertical to horizontal coupling
factor of 1%, the maximum acceptable noise for the sensor is 10−15 m/√Hz.
This speciﬁcation is quite severe, although not impossible, and requires an
interferometric readout system.

All these questions must be carefully investigated before concluding that direct
levitation of the mirrors can be actually applied to GW detectors. Another
possibility, studied in this paper, is the usage of a levitation system as an
intermediate stage of a Virgo-like multi-stage seismic attenuator.

The Virgo seismic suspension, called Superattenuator (SA), is a pendulum
with blade springs at each of its ﬁve stages, which provides a vibration atten-
uation in six degrees of freedom by more than 200 dB in the whole measure-

2

10 kHz). A detailed description
ment frequency band of the antenna (4 Hz
of the SA can be found in [14]; in the following, we will only review its most
relevant features. Fig. 1 shows a Virgo SA which can be conceptually divided
into two parts.

•

The upper one, including the 6-meter inverted pendulum supporting the
ﬁve attenuation stages.
The lower one, called payload, made of an intermediate mass – the mari-
onetta –, supporting the mirror itself, and of the reference mass, a cylindrical
shell suspended around the mirror with same mass and same barycenter.

Tab. 1 lists the masses of the diﬀerent SA components. The mirror orienta-
tion and position can be controlled using coils as actuators. They are either
attached to the last stage of the upper part of the SA and acting on mag-
nets glued on the marionetta, or ﬁxed to the reference mass and acting on
small magnets directly ﬁxed on the mirror edges. The lower part of the SA
is in ultra-high vacuum (< 10−7 mbar) to avoid contamination of the mirror
surfaces by hydrocarbonates in particular, while the upper part is only under
high vacuum (10−6 mbar), because of the outgassing of several components
of the suspension. To avoid the contamination of the mirrors, the two vac-
uum chambers are separated by a roof with a small conductance hole for the
suspension wire.

Due to the low frequency thermal drifts of the system, the centering of the
wire in conductance hole is quite diﬃcult and requires periodic re-adjustment,
or the use of a closed loop control for long term operation.

A possible alternative solution of the problem is the levitation of the mar-
ionetta, as shown in Fig. 2. In this way, the upper and lower parts of the
vacuum chamber could be completely isolated by a dielectric and transparent
roof, eliminating the conductance hole. This conﬁguration is much less sensi-
tive to the noise problems described earlier, as both the sensor noise and the
external EM noise are injected at the level of the marionetta and are thus ﬁl-
tered by the last stage of the suspension, providing an additional attenuation
of more than two orders of magnitude at 10 Hz. Indeed, the speciﬁcation on
the sensor noise can be relaxed to 10−13 m/√Hz.

The main goal of this work is thus to evaluate the possibility of suspending
with magnetic levitation a given mass (on the order of the sum of the masses
of the mirror and of the reference mass) at manageable cost.

In the following sections, we analyze the feasibility of such a levitated system.
In Section 2, the general principle of stable levitation [3] is shortly recalled.
Then, the numerical procedures used to compute the forces between the diﬀer-
ent magnets are described. In Section 2.2, the simulation results for magnetic
levitation applied to the Virgo suspensions are presented. An experimental

3

test – described in Section 2.3 – shows the feasibility of the magnetic levi-
tation; the experimental results obtained on a small levitated suspension are
compared with the predictions of some numerical simulations in order to check
the validity of the model.

2 Magnetic suspension system

As it is well known, a stable levitation in a constant magnetic ﬁeld can be
obtained only with superconducting and diamagnetic materials [1,2,3,4]. Us-
ing superconducting materials requires low temperature operation; thus, their
integration in the seismic suspension of GW detectors looks complex and ex-
pensive. Moreover, for diamagnetic materials, levitating very small pieces re-
quires intense ﬁelds, which makes the suspension of a payload of several tens
of kilograms (see Tab. 1) almost impossible. On the other hand, using a mag-
netic ﬁeld of variable intensity controlled by a feedback system in association
with permanent magnets and electromagnets is more promising.

The general principle of such device can be seen in Fig. 2 and 3: a permanent
magnet of mass m2 is attached to the mass to be levitated (for the Virgo SA,
the payload and the mirror) and is attracted by a ﬁxed magnet of mass m1
(on the SA upper part) which exactly balances the gravitational force. In this
conﬁguration, the equilibrium position is stable in the horizontal direction,
but unstable in the vertical one. This conﬁguration can become stable if a coil
acting on the levitated magnet is added, with a current intensity I depending
on the vertical position of the levitated mass. This position can be measured
with any type of position sensor (a shadow meter for our experiment, see
Section 2.3). In principle, the ﬁxed magnet m1 could be removed, but in this
case, a large DC current would be necessary to balance the weight of the
levitated piece.

2.1 The numerical simulation

Testing the feasibility of such technique is not enough, as one cannot simply
scale a system made of point-like magnets to a large device using extended
magnets, such as the one needed for a Virgo SA: the dipole approximation is no
more valid to compute the magnetic force. Therefore, an accurate calculation
of the forces between the ﬁxed and the levitated magnets is needed.

Numerically, the magnetic ﬁeld generated by a couple of big magnets is com-
puted by dividing the large pieces into inﬁnitesimal volumes, as shown in
Fig. 4. Using the corresponding magnetization per unit volume, it is possible

4

to apply the dipole approximation between any two such small regions (one in
each magnet), provided that their separation is much larger than their sizes.
The ﬁnal force is the sum of all these inﬁnitesimal contributions. For instance,
in Fig.4, the vector ~r gives the position of an inﬁnitesimal volume of the ﬁxed
magnet (with respect to the origin O of the reference system, chosen at the
center of the ﬁxed magnet), while −→r′ points on the levitated magnet. ∆~r is
deﬁned as the separation vector between the two considered volumes.

The computation of the forces between extended magnets has been imple-
mented in MATLAB [16]. The main aim of this tool is to study the best
conﬁguration, by changing the dimensions of the two magnets and their sepa-
ration. Of course, the accuracy of the computation depends on the dimensions
of the inﬁnitesimal volume adopted for the simulation. In each computation,
they have been reduced iteratively until convergence (within 2%). In our nu-
merical code, the shape, the size and the separation of the magnets are free
parameters; for simplicity, we use parallelepipedal magnets.

2.2 Simulation results

For a given geometrical conﬁguration, the force between the magnets depends
on the residual magnetization Br, a magnet proper parameter. For our com-
putation, we use Nd-Fe-B magnets which have currently the higher residual
3
magnetization (Br = 1.3 T); the density of this material is ρ = 7.4 g/cm
.
For each magnet, the dimensions to be optimized are the length, that is the
size of the rectangular parallelepiped in the direction the optical axis of the
suspended mirror, the width, deﬁned as the size along the transfer dimension
and the vertical thickness.

The goal of our study is to determine how the static force between the ﬁxed
and the levitated magnet changes with their sizes and their separation. In
particular, we use as parameter the ‘free-gap’ d, i.e. the distance between the
two magnets. In this way, we can evaluate the maximum mass that can be
levitated in each conﬁguration. In all cases, we need to subtract to the total
levitated mass M the weight of the levitated magnet m, so that we get the
eﬀective payload (mirror + marionetta) mass Mp.

Another subject studied here is the dependence of the mass to be suspended
and of the horizontal restoring force on the length and the width of the mag-
nets. This allows us to study the performance of the levitated system as a
seismic isolator [12].

The ﬁrst simulation aims at evaluating the maximum weight of the levitated
mass Mp as a function of the levitated magnet thickness h. Fig. 5 shows

5

the result: the simulation has been done for two diﬀerent “free-gap” values
(d = 5 cm and d = 10 cm) and for two diﬀerent upper magnet conﬁgurations:
10) cm3. The levitated magnet dimensions

are (15

For instance, when the thickness of the levitated magnet to be h = 2 cm,
it is possible to suspend about 50 kg when the free-gap is 10 cm and for
10) cm3. As we can see in Fig. 5, the
upper magnet dimensions of (20
×
maximum mass to be suspended increases with the thickness and of course
strongly depends on the free-gap. An interesting point, apparently counter-
intuitive, is that for given values of h and d, the force is smaller for the upper
magnet with the larger lateral size. This aspect will be clariﬁed later.

The second step is to evaluate the dependence of Mp on the upper magnet
thickness H. The result is shown in Fig. 6: simulations have been done for
two free-gap values already considered and for two diﬀerent levitated magnet

We can see that it is possible to obtain a levitated mass of 120.5 kg in the

Looking at Fig. 6, we can see that it is almost useless to increase the thickness
H above 30
40 cm because the force becomes almost constant. As expected,
there is still a strong dependence on the gap; for example, we obtain almost
the same force with a much smaller suspended magnet, by reducing d from
10 cm to 5 cm.

The third simulation studies the evolution of the levitated mass Mp when the
free-gap d varies, as Fig. 7 shows; the upper magnet dimensions are, in this

case, (20
the suspendable mass value decreases with the increase of the free-gap.

The variation of the suspendable mass Mp versus the length L of the upper
magnet is the topic of the fourth simulation. As shown in Fig. 8, the calculation
has been done for a set of diﬀerent free-gap values ranging from d = 5 cm
10) cm3 for
to d = 20 cm. The dimensions of the magnets are (L
2) cm3 for the levitated one. As we can see
15
the upper one and (15
from the Figure, using an upper magnet too long with respect to the free-
gap dimension is not an advantage, because the force crosses a maximum and
then decreases asymptotically to a constant value. This eﬀect has been already
observed in Fig 5. It can be easily explained by noting that the force along
the magnetic dipole direction changes its sign when the transverse distance of
the two dipoles becomes much larger than their longitudinal one.

The last investigated point is the dependence of the restoring force along the
mirror optical axis direction on the variation of the upper magnet length L.
This calculation has been done for diﬀerent free-gap values, d = 5 cm and
2) cm3 and for a constant
d = 20 cm, for a levitated magnet (15
‘misalignment’ of 1 mm along the length direction, as shown in Fig. 9. As we
can see, the restoring force is always vanishing for L
; in this case, as
proposed by Drever [12], the system behaves like a pendulum with a very low
resonant frequency, i.e. it is in principle a very good seismic isolator.

The interesting point is that, for some gap-length conﬁgurations, the restoring
force can become negative: in this case the system gets unstable in the hori-
zontal direction. As a consequence, there is a ﬁnite length giving a restoring
50 cm. So, for L approaching this value, we
force equal to zero, ranging 40
can get a stable conﬁguration with very small restoring force even with a ﬁnite
magnet. For example, if we take a magnet with L = 40 cm, with d = 5 cm
95 kg (see Fig. 9) with an horizontal restoring force
we can levitate up to
0.23 Hz: this
of only 200 N/m, corresponding to a resonant frequency of
is the equivalent of a 45 m-long pendulum. As a comparison, the SA main
resonance frequency is around 30 mHz which is equivalent to a 275 m-long
simple pendulum.

2.3 Experimental test

3

A magnetic suspension prototype has been realized in Naples [15] to check
the correctness of our models and to verify that we take into account all the
relevant eﬀects. Our set-up is sketched in Fig. 3; we use Sm-Co cylindrical
magnets which have a residual magnetization Br = 0.8 T and a density ρ =
8.3 g/cm
. The radius is R = 7 mm while the thickness is h = 12 mm for the
ﬁxed magnet and 8 mm for the levitated one with a mass m of about 10 g. To
measure the vertical position of the payload, we use a shadow-meter sensor
made of a laser diode partially intersected by the payload lower edge and a
photodetector. To get a stable position we feedback on a coil acting on the
levitated magnet with a force/current characteristic of about 1 N/A. In this
way we are able to hold constant the vertical position of the payload respect
to the ground. Using this conﬁguration it is possible to suspend a payload of
about 45 g with a free-gap ranging between 1 and 3 cm. The ‘ﬁxed’ magnet
is mounted on a micrometric translator allowing to change the free-gap and
consequently the vertical force between the magnets. When this force exactly
balanced the total weight of the suspended body, the DC current ﬂowing in
the coil is zero. The changing of the vertical distance of the magnets with
the micrometer results in a non-zero DC current because the force exerted by
the coil must balance the diﬀerence between the weight and magnets forces.
In this way, the current ﬂowing in the coil provides a measurement of the

7

force between the magnets (subtracted of the weight of the suspended mass).
Fig. 10 shows the dependence of the measured force between the magnets
on the distance between the centers of the magnets. The theoretical curve
computed with our simulation model (dashed line) is superimposed to the
experimental points. As we can see, the experimental points are in agreement
with the model. For comparison, we add the force computed by approximating
the extended magnets as point-like dipoles placed in their centers; as expected,
the point-like dipole approximation becomes unsatisfactory as the distance
decreases and disagrees with the experiment for a distance below 3 cm.

3 Conclusion

In this paper we studied the application of a magnetic levitation system to
the seismic suspensions of long baseline GW antennas. From the results of the
simulations shown in Sec. 2.2, we can summarize the following conclusions.

First, it appears that it is possible to levitate a mass comparable to the one
of a Virgo-like payload, choosing reasonable dimensions for both the ﬁxed
and levitated magnet. This can also be done maintaining a free-gap of several
centimeters, which would allow the insertion of a dielectric roof to separate
the upper and the lower vacuum chambers.

A second interesting point is that, with a suitable magnet arrangement, the
levitated system behaves also as a low frequency seismic attenuator, which im-
proves thus the overall attenuation performance of the suspension. To improve
the stability of the device, a pair of magnets aligned with opposing polarity
can be used instead of a single one, as ﬁrst suggested in Ref. [12]. This con-
ﬁguration was validated experimentally in the Naples Virgo laboratory [15].

In this conﬁguration, the weights of the two magnets are 66.4 kg and 3.3 kg
respectively, while the levitated payload Mp is
95 kg. As explained before,
the horizontal oscillation frequency is, in this case, 0.23 Hz, giving an extra
attenuation of about 74 db at 10 Hz.

The validity of the numerical model adopted for computing forces exerted
between extended magnets has been experimentally tested with a small pro-
totype suspension. The experimental results are in good agreement with the
model. Of course, the study presented here only shows the feasibility of the
principle; one of the main limitation is that we did not consider the coupling
with the angular degrees of freedom of the suspended payload. A detailed
study would be necessary to design a real suspension taking into account the

8

need of controlling the other degrees of freedom of the mirror and other tech-
nical aspects, like the longitudinal control and the automatic alignment of
the interferometer. In addition, a suspension designed for GW interferometers
must not inject too many noise in the detector. Therefore, noise contributions
originating from the magnetic conﬁguration itself – like eddy and Johnson
current eﬀects – have to be taken into account on a full-scale prototype to see
whether or not they limit the suspension performances. This is beyond the
goal of this paper.

Fig. 9. Dependence of the restoring force along the mirror optical axis direction
on the variation of the upper magnet length L: results are shown for two diﬀerent
2) cm3
free-gap values (d = 5 cm and d = 10 cm), for a levitated magnet (15
and for a constant misalignment of 1 mm along the length direction.The restoring
force is always vanishing for L
, but for some gap-length conﬁgurations, it can
become negative: in this case the system gets unstable in the horizontal direction,
i.e. for d = 5 cm the restoring force is equal to zero, ranging 40
50 cm; so, for L
approaching this value, we can get a stable conﬁguration with very small restoring
force even with a ﬁnite magnet.

Fig. 10. Dependence of the force measured between the magnets on the distance
between the magnet centers. The theoretical curve computed with our simulation
model (dashed line) has been superimposed to the experimental points which are in
agreement with the model. For comparison, the force computed by approximating
the extended magnets as point-like dipoles placed in their centers is added; as ex-
pected the point-like dipole approximation becomes unsatisfactory as the distance
decreases and is in disagreement with the experiment for a distance below 3 cm.

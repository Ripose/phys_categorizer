Abstract

In this article the physics motivation and the
detector design of the OPERA experiment will
be reviewed. The construction status of the
detector, which will be situated in the CNGS
beam from CERN to the Gran Sasso labora-
tory, will be reported. A survey on the physics
performance will be given and the physics plan
in 2006 will be presented.

Introduction

↔

The CNGS project is designed to search for the
νµ
ντ oscillation in the parameter region in-
dicated by the SuperKamiokande, Macro and
Soudan2 atmospheric neutrino analysis [1], [2],
[3]. The main goal is to ﬁnd ντ appearance by
direct detection of the τ from ντ CC interac-
tions. One will also search for the subleading
νe oscillations, which could be observed
νµ
if θ13 is close to the present limit from CHOOZ
[4] and PaloVerde [5]. In order to reach these
goals a νµ beam will be sent from CERN to
Gran Sasso. In the Gran Sasso laboratory, the
OPERA experiment (CNGS1) is under con-
struction.

↔

At the distance of L = 732 km between
the CERN and the Gran Sasso laboratory the
νµ ﬂux of the beam is optimized to yield a
maximum number of CC ντ interactions at

Gran Sasso. With a mean beam energy of
E = 17 GeV the contamination with ¯νµ is
around 2 % and with νe (¯νe) is less than 1 %.
The content of ντ is negligible. The resulting
L/E ratio is 43 km/GeV, thus the CNGS op-
erates in the ”oﬀ peak” mode due to the high
energy needed for τ production. The civil en-
gineering has been completed, all beam parts
are produced and will be installed in time. The
commissioning will start in May 2006 and the
ﬁrst beam is expected in July 2006. Assuming
1019 pot/year and
a beam intensity of 4.5
a ﬁve year run, 31000 neutrino events (CC +
NC) are expected for an average target mass
of 1.6 kt. At full mixing, 95 ντ CC interactions
10−3 eV2 and 214
are expected for ∆m2 = 2
10−3 eV2.

The detection of the ντ ’s will be done by
looking for the charged τ lepton produced in
ντ CC interaction, and its decay products. The
diﬀerent τ decay modes can be separated into
muonic (BR 18 %), electronic (BR 18 %) and
hadronic (BR 64 %) channels.
In order to
observe the decay topology, a spatial resolu-
tion at the micrometer scale is necessary.
In
OPERA, such a resolution is achieved by de-
tecting the charged particle tracks in emulsion
sheets interspersed with thin lead plates act-
ing as target material. This technique, known
as Emulsion Cloud Chamber (ECC), was val-
idated for τ search in the DONUT experi-
ment [6]. The basic target module is called
a brick.
It consists of a sandwich of 57 lead
plates (1 mm thick) with in total 56 emul-

1

sion layers in between. A brick has a size of
10.2 cm
12.7 cm with a length of 7.5 cm (10
radiation lengths) and a weight of 8.3 kg. In
a separate package, two additional emulsion
sheets, called changable sheets, are glued on
its downstream face. The bricks are arranged
in brick walls. Within a brick, the achieved
spatial resolution is ∆x = 1 µm and the an-
gular resolution is ∆θ = 2 mrad. With these
values, the reconstruction of the ν interaction
vertex and of the τ decay topology will be pos-
sible. The brick as stand alone detector also
allows, to some extent, the momentum mea-
surement of charged particles by multiple scat-
tering, the separation of low energy π and µ by
dE/dx measurements and the identiﬁcation of
electrons and photons by measurement of the
electromagnetic shower development. To pro-
vide a ν interaction trigger and to identify the
brick in which the interaction took place, the
brick walls are complemented by a target and a
muon spectrometer. The target tracker consist
of highly segmented scintillator planes inserted
between the brick walls while, downstream the
target section, the magnetic spectrometer will
measure the muon momenta and identify the
sign of their charges. Combining the signals
left in the electronic detectors by the hadronic
shower and, eventually, the muon track, the
brick containing the ν interaction vertex can
be determined with a good eﬃciency. The
brick is then extracted from the wall and its
changable sheets are developed and scanned
using fast automatic microscopes. Once the
presence of tracks coming out of an interaction
is conﬁrmed, the brick is unpacked and all its
emulsion sheets are developed and sent to the
scanning laboratories for further analysis.

The OPERA detector, shown in ﬁg 1, consists
of two identical super-modules. Each super-

module consists of a target section with 31
target planes in between the brick walls, fol-
lowed by a muon spectrometer. With a total
number of about 206000 bricks, an initial mass
of 1.8 kt will be achieved. The target tracker
covers a total area of 7000 m2 and is built of
32000 scintillator strips, each 7 m long and of
15 mm cross section. Along the strip,
25 mm
a wavelength shifting ﬁber of 1 mm diameter
transmits the light signals to both ends. The
readout will be done by 1000 64 channel matrix
PMT’s from HAMAMATSU. Since the end of
the last year the data taking with cosmics has
started. The target of the ﬁrst super-module
(yet to be ﬁlled with bricks) was installed in
November 2005, the second target will be in-
stalled in June 2006. The achieved brick wall
position accuracy is better than 1 mm.

The muon spectrometer consists of the mag-
net instrumented with RPC’s and drift tubes.

The magnet is a 8
ﬁeld of 1.55 T in upward direction on one side
and in downward direction on the other side.
This gives the possibility to measure the mo-
mentum twice in order to reduce the error by
√2. Each magnet side consists of twelve 5 cm
thick iron slabs, alternating with RPC planes.
This sandwich structure allows the tracking in
the magnetic ﬁeld to identify the muons and
to determine their momentum. In addition the
precision tracker [7] measures the muon track
coordinates in the horizontal plane. It is made
of 8 m long drift tubes with an outer diameter

handle the data ﬂow a new DAQ system was
developed. It will use a Gigabit network con-
sisting of 1200 nodes. To match the data of
the diﬀerent subdetectors a event time stamp
will be used. This will be delivered by a clock
distribution system using the GPS1. The heart
of the DAQ is the Mezzanine chip. It contains
the CPU, the memory, the clock receiver for
the time stamp and the ethernet connections
to the other components. All the components
of the DAQ system are available and the ﬁnal
version of the Mezzanine is under test.

The production of the bricks will be done by
the brick assembling machine (BAM). It con-
sists of robots for the mechanical packing of
the bricks. In total 23 million lead plates and
emulsion layers have to be assembled to 206000
bricks. The required production speed will be
2 bricks per minute. The ﬁnal system was suc-
cessfully tested and is ready for installation at
the Gran Sasso laboratory.

Inside the detector the produced bricks will
be handled by the brick manipulator system
(BMS). Two large robots, each one operat-
ing at one side of the detector, consist of a
drum for the brick transfer and a brick storage
carousel. A pushing arm will be used to insert
the bricks in any given row. The extraction of
a brick in the region of interest indicated by
the electronic detectors will be done by a vac-

of 38 mm. These drift tubes are arranged in
planes, located in front and behind the mag-
net as well as between the two magnet sides.
The precision tracker consists of 12 drift tube
planes, each covering an area of 8 m
8 m.
Together with the precision tracker, the eﬃ-
ciency of the muon identiﬁcation as well as
the accuracy of the momentum measurements
and sign determination can be increased; the
charge misidentiﬁcation is expected to be 0.1 %
- 0.3 %. This value is important to minimize
the background originating from the charmed
particles produced in νµ interactions. With
the muon spectrometer a momentum resolu-
tion of ∆p/p
0.25 for all muon momenta
p up to a maximum of p = 25 GeV/c can be
achieved. To reduce the number of ghost tracks
two planes of glass RPC’s (XPC’s), each con-
sisting of two 45 ◦ crossed planes, are installed
in front of the magnets.

The construction status at the end of 2005 is
shown in ﬁg 2. The brick supporting structure
and all the tracker planes of the ﬁrst super-
module are installed. The XPC’s and three of
the high precision tracker planes of the ﬁrst
super-module are installed. The magnets, in-
cluding the RPC’s for the whole detector and
the mechanical structure are completed. To

lines) and the 4σ discovery probability (solid

The detection eﬃciency of a tau decay has been
studied by detailed Monte Carlo simulations.
One may distinguish two cases:
in so-called
short decays, the tau decays in the lead plate
in which it is produced and the only signature
is a non-zero impact parameter of the decay
products with respect to the primary neutrino
vertex. This vertex can only be determined re-
liably for multi-prong deeply inelastic scatter-
ings (DIS). On the contrary, for ”long” decays,
the tau track direction can be directly mea-
sured and the kink angle of the charged decay
products accurately determined, both for DIS
and quasi elastic (QE) neutrino interactions.
The resulting τ detection eﬃciencies for the de-
tected channels, weighted with their branching
ratios, are listed in table 1.

The ﬁrst OPERA run is scheduled for the
second half of 2006. After the completion and
the commissioning of the CNGS beam, a low

events is listed for a nominal beam intensity
1019 pot/year. The values in brack-
of 4.5
ets apply for an increase in beam intensity by
a factor of 1.5. The resulting sensitivity and
the 4σ discovery probability, the probability
that one can claim to have seen a signal larger
than a 4σ ﬂuctuation of the background, are
shown in ﬁg 4. This probability is described
by the solid lines dependent on the value of
∆m2. The OPERA nominal run with an aver-
age target mass of 1.6 kt includes an improved
brick ﬁnding and the 3π hadronic decay chan-
nel. The probability can be increased by reduc-
ing the background by 30 % an by increasing
the beam intensity by a factor of 1.5. In the
case that no ντ appearance will be seen, an ex-
clusion region (90 % CL) can be given. These
sensitivities (vertical lines) are computed using

4 Conclusion

↔

↔

The OPERA experiment was designed to
search for the νµ
ντ oscillation. A search
for νµ
νe oscillation will also be performed,
in order to measure the angle θ13. The project
will start operating in July 2006. The discov-
ery of the ντ appearance in νµ
ντ oscillation
is an important part of the neutrino oscillation
puzzle. OPERA will also prepare the way for
future neutrino appearance experiments.

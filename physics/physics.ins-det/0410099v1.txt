Abstract

An experiment measuring the 2S Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen (µ−p) is being per-
formed at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. It requires small and compact
detectors for 1.9 keV x rays (2P –1S transition) with an energy resolution around
25% at 2 keV, a time resolution better than 100 ns, a large solid angle coverage,
and insensitivity to a 5 T magnetic ﬁeld. We have chosen Large Area Avalanche
Photodiodes (LAAPDs) from Radiation Monitoring Devices as x–ray detectors, and
they were used during the last data taking period in 2003. For x–ray spectroscopy
applications, these LAAPDs have to be cooled in order to suppress the dark current
noise, hence, a series of tests were performed to choose the optimal operation tem-
perature. Speciﬁcally, the temperature dependence of gain, energy resolution, dark
current, excess noise factor, and detector response linearity was studied. Finally,

1 Introduction

An experiment measuring the 2S Lamb shift ∆E(2P −2S) in muonic hydrogen
(µ−p) by precision laser spectroscopy is being performed at the Paul Scher-
rer Institute (PSI), Switzerland [1]. The experiment requires the detection of
1.9 keV x–rays from the muonic hydrogen Kα Lyman line. The apparatus
is installed in a muon beam area at the PSI proton accelerator, an environ-
ment with a rather high level of neutron–induced radiative processes as well
as electromagnetic and acoustic noise.

The 1.9 keV x–ray detector has to reach an energy resolution of ∼25% and a
time resolution better than 100 ns. To optimize the solid angle for x–rays, the
detector has to be mounted as near as possible to the pencil–shaped volume
where the µ−p atoms are formed. There is space for two sets of x–ray detectors
(with sensitive areas up to ∼ 2 × 17 cm2) at the top and bottom side of the
gas target which is mounted inside a solenoid with 20 cm inner diameter. The
magnetic ﬁeld of 5 T produced by the solenoid is another limitation for the
detector choice. In addition, the whole target and detector setup is operated
in vacuum.

The experiment was installed for the ﬁrst time in the muon beam area during
an engineering run in 2002. A second beam period followed in 2003 during
which the apparatus was further improved. Valuable data were taken in the
last few weeks of the 2003 run with the aim to search for the 2P −2S resonance.

In 2002 we used Large Area Avalanche Photodiodes from Advanced Pho-
tonix Inc. [2] (API LAAPDs), a representative of the beveled–edge LAAPDs,
reviewed, for example, in Ref. [3]. They are circular, with a 16 mm diam-
eter active surface surrounded by a ∼ 5 mm wide ring of inactive material
(Fig. 1). Their behavior in high magnetic ﬁelds was studied in Refs. [4,5],

while a systematic investigation of their low temperature performance in x–
ray and visible–light detection can be found in Ref. [6]. An example of their
application to muonic atom spectroscopy during the ﬁrst stages of our exper-
iment is given in Ref. [7].

surface area and square planar RMD LAAPD (right) with 13.5 × 13.5 mm2 active
surface.

During the most recent measurements in 2003 we replaced the API diodes by
LAAPDs from Radiation Monitoring Devices Inc. [8] (RMD LAAPDs). Two
arrays of these detectors mounted below and above the pencil shaped target
have a considerably larger solid angle for x–ray detection due to the LAAPD
square shape and better ratio of sensitive to total detector area (Fig. 1). The
principle of the RMD LAAPDs, in particular their novel planar bevel fabrica-
tion process, is summarized in Ref. [9]. In Sec. 2 we describe these LAAPDs,
their performance and the results of systematic tests. Section 3 contains some
details about the RMD LAAPDs application in our experiment, in particular
their response to alpha particles. A comparison with the previously used API
LAAPDs is given in the conclusions.

2 Properties of the RMD LAAPDs

2.1 First tests

RMD LAAPDs, model S1315, are square planar devices with 13.5 mm×13.5 mm
sensitive area surrounded by 1 mm wide borders of inactive material. The op-
erational voltage indicated by the manufacturer is in the region from 1560 to
1765 V at 23‰. The ﬁrst tests with a 55Fe source emitting 5.9 keV x rays
performed at temperatures above 0‰ have shown that these LAAPDs require
cooling to temperatures well below zero degrees Celsius in order to detect low
energy x rays with an acceptable resolution. The main reason is a high dark

3

current reaching 1 µA at 1620 V at room temperature; when cooled to 1‰,
1 µA is reached at 1710 V (Fig. 2).

At room temperature, the noise tail in the energy spectrum extends up to
∼ 6 keV. By cooling below −20‰, satisfactory results were obtained not only
for 5.9 keV x rays, but also for 2.3 keV x rays, for which an energy resolution
of 26% FWHM was reached. The 2.3 keV x rays were produced by sulfur
ﬂuorescing when irradiated by a strong 55Fe source. An example of such a
spectrum measured at −23‰ is shown in Fig. 3 where 2.3 keV and 5.9 keV
x–ray peaks, as well as a peak due to the test pulses from a pulse generator,
which are fed directly to the preampliﬁer, are visible. The noise tail ends at
0.9 keV which makes x–ray spectroscopy around 2 keV well feasible.

23‰ ((cid:7)).

2.2 Experimental set–up

In order to choose the optimal working temperature and to better understand
the temperature dependence of the RMD LAAPD performance both for x–
ray and visible–light detection, a series of tests were performed. X rays with
energies up to 15 keV from 54Mn, 55Fe, and 57Co radioactive sources were
used. Light pulses from a light emitting diode (LED) with a peak emission at
635 nm were carried by a light guide to the LAAPD surface. The LED light
intensity was varied to achieve an energy equivalent (LAAPD pulse height) of
11 to 14.5 keV.

The LAAPDs were operated in a light–tight, thermally insulated box. A con-

stant ﬂow of cold nitrogen gas, regulated by a heater submerged in a container
of liquid nitrogen, was used for LAAPD cooling with a temperature stabiliza-
tion within ± 0.5‰.

The LAAPD signals were fed into a low–noise charge–sensitive integrating
RAL 108A preampliﬁer [10] followed by a linear ampliﬁer HP 5582A, for which
a gain between 16 and 128 as well as a 200 ns shaping time constant were used.
A PC–based, 1024–channel analyzer Nucleus PCA II was used to record the
energy spectra.

2.3 Gain measurements

Absolute gain measurements rely on the determination of unity gain, which
was found by averaging the amplitudes of 100 ns visible–light LED pulses
(635 nm wavelength) measured at a bias voltage in the range from 300 to
500 V. For bias voltages below 300 V the recombination of the primary
electron–hole pairs plays an important role and the absolute gain is below
one. Figure 4 shows the relative amplitudes of the light pulses as a function of
high voltage, together with the dark current observed during the measurement.
A horizontal line shows the unity gain.

Assuming that the visible–light and the x–ray gains are equal at low LAAPD
gains, the absolute gain for x rays was determined with a 55Fe source emitting
5.9 keV x rays. Absolute x–ray gain versus high voltage, for the temperature
range from −46‰ to 17‰, is given in Fig. 5.

rent ((cid:4)) versus high voltage; measurement performed at 7‰. The horizontal line

−40‰ (△), −33‰ (#), −17‰ (3), −8‰ ((cid:3)), 0‰ (*), 10‰ ((cid:4)), and 17‰ ((cid:7)).

For a given bias voltage, the gain increases exponentially with decreasing
temperature as seen in Fig. 6. The dependency is more pronounced for higher
bias voltages and similar for both x rays (solid lines) and visible light (dashed
lines). Below a certain temperature the gain starts to increase even more
rapidly, as it is demonstrated in Fig. 6.

Measurements were performed at constant high voltages with x rays (solid lines) at
(from right to left) 1530, 1560, 1600, 1640, 1670, 1720, and 1750 V and with visible
light (dashed lines) at 1590, 1625, 1660, and 1700 V.

2.4 Energy resolution

At low gain values the energy resolution improves with increasing gain. This
trend continues up to a gain around 200 where the optimum is obtained, for
both 5.9 keV x rays (Fig. 7) and visible light (Fig. 8). This optimal gain value
does not depend on the temperature. Higher gain increases the eﬀect of spatial
nonuniformity of the LAAPD gain. Due to the local character of the x–ray
interaction with an LAAPD, this eﬀect worsens the x–ray energy resolution.
For light detection the whole illuminated area contributes to the output signal,
averaging local gain variations [11]. Consequently and in contrast to the x rays,
the visible–light energy resolution remains constant at gains above 250.

Simultaneous measurements of 5.4 keV x rays, visible–light pulses, and test
signals from a pulse generator were made at diﬀerent gains and temperatures.
The energy calibration was determined by the x–ray peak and the LAAPD
gain was deduced from the position of the visible–light peak. The position of
the test–pulse peak does not depend on the LAAPD gain. Its width represents
the LAAPD dark current and preampliﬁer noise contributions to the overall
resolution [3]. To express the test–pulse width as a relative energy resolution,
it has to be normalized to a given energy which was chosen to be 5.9 keV, as
shown in Fig. 9. Also here, the resolution reaches the minimum at a gain of
about 200 and stabilizes for higher gains. The similar behavior of the visible–
light and test–pulse resolutions is explained in Sec. 2.6.

11–14.5 keV x rays.

2.5 Dark current

The dark current depends strongly on the temperature and LAAPD gain.
At a given temperature it increases with gain and is reduced by an order of

magnitude for each 20‰ temperature decrease, as shown in Fig. 10. At −33‰
and in the gain region below 800 the dark current is below 10 nA.

2.6 Excess noise factor

Measurements of the 5.4 keV x–rays from a 54Mn source, visible–light, and
test pulses were made simultaneously for diﬀerent temperatures and diﬀerent
gains, allowing us to study the temperature dependence of the excess noise
factor (F ), deﬁned [3] as

F = 1 + σ2

A/M 2 ,

where M is the LAAPD gain and σA its variance. Neglecting the small light–
intensity ﬂuctuations and considering that detector inhomogeneity contribu-
tions to the energy resolution are averaged out for the light measurements,
the energy resolution ∆E (FWHM) of the light peak with a Gaussian shape
can be described [3] as

∆E2 = (2.355)2F Eε + ∆2

noise

where E is the energy equivalent of the light peak, ε is the energy per electron–
hole pair creation in Si (3.6 eV), and ∆2
noise is the dark noise contribution of
the diode–preampliﬁer system.

In the energy spectrum, the x–ray peak gives the energy calibration. The
FWHM of the test pulses peak deﬁnes ∆2
noise. The deduced value of F was
found to be temperature independent and slowly increasing with the LAAPD
gain (Fig. 11). A faster increase at gains above 300 reﬂects the contribution
of holes to the ampliﬁcation process [11]. Typical values were F ≈ 2.2 at gain
200 and F ≈ 2.8 at gain 600; this represents a 27% increase.

As given by Eq. (2), for light pulses with an energy equivalent E there are
two contributions to the resolution ∆E. By cooling, the contribution from the
dark current noise ∆2
noise is suppressed (Fig. 9) and the contribution due to the
temperature independent increase of the excess noise factor becomes relatively
more signiﬁcant. However, it is important to note that a 27% increase of F is
accompanied by only a small increase of ∆E even at low temperatures. For
the light pulses with an energy equivalent in the range 11 − 14.5 keV, the
corresponding ∆E increase is below 4%, 7%, and 10% at temperatures 10‰,
0‰, and −12‰, respectively. This also explains the similar behavior of the
visible–light and test–pulse resolutions as functions of LAAPD gain, as was
shown in Sec. 2.4 and in Figs. 8 and 9.

and 10‰ ((cid:4)).

2.7 Nonlinearity

The use of the x–ray peak for the energy calibration of the light peak is
correct only if the LAAPD response is perfectly linear, i.e., if the resulting
signal amplitude is proportional to the initial number of electron–hole pairs.
In reality, there is a well–known nonproportionality between the gains for x–
ray and visible–light events, as well as between x–ray events with diﬀerent
energies [3,6,11,12,13]. In contrast to visible light, an x ray interacting in the
LAAPD produces high charge densities causing both a decrease of the local
electric ﬁeld and local heating. The eﬀect is important at higher gains and
causes the x–ray gain to be smaller than the visible–light gain.

The nonlinearity for x rays with diﬀerent energies was measured with a 57Co
source by comparing the relative positions of the 6.4 keV Fe Kα line and the
14.4 keV γ line. A comparison of three such spectra measured at diﬀerent
temperatures and diﬀerent gains is presented in Fig. 12.

The amplitude ratio of the 14.4 and 6.4 keV x–ray signals versus gain, mea-
sured at −20‰ and 1‰ is shown in Fig. 13. The LAAPD nonlinear response
for x rays with diﬀerent energies is temperature independent; normalized to
the value for linear operation, 14.4/6.4, the nonlinear eﬀect is 11% at gain 200
and 16% at gain 400.

The ratio of the x–ray to visible–light gains, shown in Fig. 14, was measured by
a simultaneous illumination of the LAAPD by 5.4 keV x rays and by visible–

14.4 keV γ rays from a 57Co source, performed at −24‰ (solid line), 1‰ (dashed
line), and 27‰ (dotted line) at gains 400, 350, and 200, respectively. Each spectrum
was separately calibrated in energy such that the 6.4 keV peak occurs at the same
position. The maxima of the 14.4 keV peaks are then at 12.4, 12.6, and 13.0 keV,
respectively, due to the nonlinear LAAPD response. The parts of the spectra above
10 keV for the measurements at 1‰ and 27‰ are shifted in the y direction by 1000
and 2000, respectively.

light pulses. A possible temperature dependence of this ratio, as was observed
for the API LAAPDs [6], is not visible given our measurement uncertainty.
The nonlinearity eﬀect is 5% at a gain of 200, and reaches 10% at a gain of
400. Assuming that the LAAPD response to the light pulses with an energy
equivalent of 11 − 14.5 keV is linear, one can consider the nonlinearity as an
absolute nonlinearity for 5.4 keV x rays.

Assuming that the nonlinearities for 5.4 and 6.4 keV x rays are similar, the
absolute nonlinearity for 14.4 keV x rays can be estimated from the measure-
ments shown in Figs. 13 and 14. It amounts to about 15% at a gain of 200
and to about 24% at a gain of 400.

The high local charge density created in the LAAPD by an interacting x ray
— the reason for the nonlinear LAAPD response — is proportional to the
number of electron–hole pairs, and hence, at a given LAAPD gain, to the
x–ray energy. It is thus reasonable to assume that the nonlinearity at a cer-
tain gain is, in ﬁrst order, proportional to the x–ray energy. The ratio of the
nonlinearities for 14.4 keV x rays to 5.4(6.4) keV x rays is 3.0 and 2.4 for
gains 200 and 400, respectively. These ratios diﬀer from the direct ratio of the
energies 14.4/5.4(6.4) = 2.7(2.3) by less than 15%, an error introduced by the

assumption of the same nonlinearity for 5.4 and 6.4 keV x rays.

3 LAAPD application in the muonic 2S Lamb shift experiment

3.1 LAAPD operation conditions

During the most recent data taking period of the muonic 2S Lamb shift exper-
iment in 2003, two face–to–face rows of ten RMD LAAPDs each were mounted
around the target. Figure 15 shows the central part of one row. The detec-
tor assembly was operated in a vacuum of 10−6 mbar and a magnetic ﬁeld of
5 Tesla.

Fig. 15. Central part of one RMD LAAPD array. The wires are the thermometer
leads electrical connections. High voltage connections and preampliﬁers are located
on the backside of each LAAPD.

For an optimal measurement of the 1.9 keV x–ray line, we cooled the whole
mount to −30‰ by circulating cold methanol through a small heat exchanger
which was in thermal contact with the LAAPDs. The resolutions (FWHM)
obtained for 5.9 keV x rays varied for the 20 LAAPDs between 11% and 20%,
with an average of about 15%. A tendency that LAAPDs with higher gain at
a given high voltage have better resolution was observed.

The typical bias voltage was around 1600 V and the corresponding gain about
400, a value chosen for each LAAPD so that the amplitude of the 1.9 keV x–ray
signal was suﬃciently above the noise level without worsening the resolution.
Based on the discussion in Sec. 2.7 the nonlinearity for x rays with energies
∼ 2 keV can be estimated to be about 3 − 4% at gain 400. The dark current
was between 8 − 25 nA for the majority of the LAAPDs.

After the preampliﬁers, the amplitude of a 1.9 keV x–ray signal was about
2 mV. The signal rise time for 25% of the detectors was below ∼ 250 ns,
for 50% was in the interval 300 to 450 ns and for 25% was above 450 ns.
After further ampliﬁcation, the negative amplitude signals were stored in an
8–bit wave–form digitizer [14] operated at 140 MHz, which allowed an optimal
suppression of background signals with nonstandard shape and, in particular,

14

permitted the separation of two consecutive, superimposed pulses. A typical
event from one LAAPD is given in Fig. 16. The baseline noise ﬂuctuations,
although small, cannot be neglected in comparison with the amplitude of the
2 keV x ray.

Fig. 16. A typical event with two superimposed LAAPD pulses (∆t = 750 ns)
recorded by a wave–form digitizer. The pulses have negative amplitude. The small
ﬁrst pulse is a 1.9 keV x–ray signal and the second larger pulse is due to a
muon–decay electron. The digitizer dynamic range is between 0 and 255, and hence,
the second pulse is saturated between channels 600 and 800 and only gives 0 as
reading. The beginning of each signal is marked by a vertical dotted line.

3.2 LAAPD response to alpha particles

In our experiment, the LAAPDs were exposed to alpha particles with kinetic
energies from 2 to 9 MeV at a rate of about 5 s−1. The alpha particles came
from the dielectric coating of two high–reﬂectivity laser mirrors for 6 µm light
which contain thorium. The mirrors were mounted only 1.5 cm away from the
LAAPD surface.

The response of the API LAAPDs to alpha particles was studied with a colli-
mated 241Am alpha source (5.4 MeV) providing events at about 20 s−1. Due to
the high ionization density of alpha particles, they produce signals measurable
in the LAAPD even at room temperature and without bias voltage. The signal
has a long rise time of about 500 ns and becomes faster when bias voltage is
applied. At 600 V the rise time is about 230 ns and a typical alpha spectrum
with a low energy tail, due to energy losses in the source, is observed (Fig. 17).

15

Fig. 17. LAAPD energy spectrum of
the alpha particles from a 241Am source
measured at 600 V. Due to energy loss
in the source, the spectrum has a low en-
ergy tail.

Fig. 18. LAAPD energy spectrum of the
alpha particles as in Fig. 17, but mea-
sured at 1300 V. It corresponds to not
saturated signals. Note the high–energy
tail which is absent in Fig. 17.

However, with a further high voltage increase a high energy tail appears. In
addition, at about 1300 V, huge pulses are observed which correspond to a
LAAPD gain of order 105. The origin of these pulses is attributed to a plasma
discharge in the avalanche region along the very high ionization density of an
alpha particle trace [15]. These pulses cause saturation of the preampliﬁer and
have a long recovery time. In addition, the presence of these signals gives rise
to large ﬂuctuations of the LAAPD dark current. In a spectrum measured at
1300 V (Fig. 18), one may recognize a peak due to some alpha particles which
are not creating a plasma discharge. Not visible in Fig. 18 is the saturated
signal peak from the plasma discharge signals.

With an oscilloscope probe sensor we studied the shape of the plasma dis-
charge signals after the input coupling capacitor, while the preampliﬁer was
removed. The LAAPD was operated at 1780 V. The saturated signal has a
long relaxation time of 200 ms and a huge amplitude of 70 V. For compari-
son, a 6 keV x ray produces a signal of ∼ 10−4 V in amplitude. Such a long
recovery time represented an unacceptable dead time and the high amplitude
was dangerous for the preampliﬁer.

Two high conductance ultra fast diodes 1N4150 [16], chosen for their fast re-
covery time of around 5 ns, were installed at the input of the charge integrating
RAL 108A preampliﬁer [10] to limit the amplitude of plasma discharge signals.
To reduce the relaxation time, another input coupling capacitor was added and
placed after the two diodes. Both input coupling capacitances were tuned in
order to ﬁnd an optimum between shortening the relaxation time and losing
the charge sent to the preampliﬁer. A good compromise was found by using a
ﬁrst capacitance of 4.7 nF and a second of 2.2 nF. The electronic scheme in
Fig. 19 represents the ﬁnal arrangement of the preampliﬁer electronics. The
recovery time was reduced by a factor 10 to reach 20 ms, measured after the
preampliﬁer.

At lower temperatures, the characteristics of plasma discharge signals did not

change. The only diﬀerence was that they started to appear at lower voltages,
since at lower temperatures a certain gain is reached already at a lower voltage.

In our application during the 2002 data taking period, after having installed
the laser mirrors and, hence, the alpha particles source, three out of the ten
API LAAPDs were destroyed within a day. This happened after two weeks
of perfect functioning, so there was a high probability that the API LAAPDs
were destroyed by the alpha particles.

For the 2003 data taking period we used RMD LAAPDs as x–ray detectors.
Due to their rectangular shape and to only a thin border of inactive material,
they covered a larger solid angle. With 20 LAAPDs we were able to cover an
average solid angle of 30% compared to 17% obtained with the API LAAPDs.
Unfortunately, when exposed to alpha particles, their response was very similar
to that of the API LAAPDs. To avoid the risk of LAAPD damage or slow
deterioration, during the ﬁnal data taking we shielded the RMD LAAPDs
with a 0.2 mm thick lithium sheet, absorbing all alpha particles below 9 MeV,
but unavoidably also about 40% of the 1.9 keV x rays.

4 Discussion and conclusions

The experiment measuring the 2S Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen, performed
at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, has demanding requirements
for the 1.9 keV x–ray detectors. The beveled–edge API LAAPDs used in the

initial stages of the experiment were replaced by the planar RMD LAAPDs
for the latest data taking.

In our experiment the LAAPDs are exposed to alpha particles causing high
amplitude signals with a long recovery time and, with a high probability, de-
tector damage or destruction. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the detector response
to alpha particles was found in between API and RMD LAAPDs.

The results of systematic tests studying the RMD LAAPDs performance at low
temperatures were shown. In comparison, the API LAAPDs [6] show in general
better performance and require less or no cooling, but the much higher solid
angle coverage achievable with the RMD LAAPDs is an essential advantage
for an application like ours.

In order to perform any reasonable soft x–ray spectroscopy measurements,
the RMD LAAPDs have to be cooled. The dark current of RMD LAAPDs is
of the order of a few µA at room temperature whereas values around 10 nA
are reached at −30‰. In contrast, the dark current of the API LAAPDs is of
the order of a few hundred nA at a room temperature and can be reduced to
10 nA already at 0‰.

The RMD LAAPDs we used demonstrated worse energy resolution in com-
parison with the API LAAPDs. An 8% energy resolution for visible light with
the energy equivalent of about 10 keV was obtained at room temperature with
the API LAAPDs; to reach the same resolution with the RMD LAAPDs, they
needed to be cooled to −10‰. With the API LAAPDs an energy resolution
of 11% for 5.4 keV x rays at room temperature was measured; with the RMD
LAAPDs the resolution of 11% for 5.9 keV x rays was reached only at −30‰
with the best LAAPDs.

The API LAAPDs operate with their optimal resolution at gain 50. At this
gain the nonlinearity for 5.4 keV x rays is negligible and at gain 200 it reaches
only 1%. RMD LAAPDs have their best resolution at gain 200. At this gain
the nonlinearity for 5.4 keV x rays is about 5%, and at gain 400 reaches
10%. The relatively high nonlinearity of the RMD LAAPDs is not an essential
problem for our experiment, because we are interested only in the intensity
variation of the 1.9 keV x rays as a function of the laser frequency. A higher
gain achievable with the RMD LAAPDs in feasible x–ray spectroscopy mea-
surements represents an advantage, especially for an experiment realized in a
high–noise environment.

Our ﬁnal data taking was performed at typical gains of 400 with a satisfac-
tory energy resolution. All 20 RMD LAAPDs were operated for several weeks
without any deterioration. At the end it was proved that the RMD LAAPDs
are suitable for soft x–ray spectroscopy measurements.

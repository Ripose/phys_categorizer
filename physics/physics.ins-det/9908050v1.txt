Abstract

The capability of performing accurate absolute measurements of neutron beam po-
larization opens a number of exciting opportunities in fundamental neutron physics
and in neutron scattering. At the LANSCE pulsed neutron source we have measured
the neutron beam polarization with an absolute accuracy of 0.3% in the neutron
energy range from 40 meV to 10 eV using an optically-pumped polarized 3He spin
ﬁlter and a relative transmission measurement technique. 3He was polarized using
the Rb spin-exchange method. We describe the measurement technique, present our
results, and discuss some of the systematic eﬀects associated with the method.

1 Introduction

Modern experiments using low-energy neutrons address issues of importance
in nuclear, particle, and astrophysics [1]. In particular, precision measurements
of neutron decay parameters such as the decay rate and angular correlation
coeﬃcients of the decay products are of fundamental importance. In combi-
nation with a separate measurement of the neutron decay rate, for example, a
measurement of the electron asymmetry coeﬃcient in polarized neutron decay
(the A coeﬃcient) can be used to determine the weak polar vector-axial vector
coupling ratio λ = gA
gV and, by comparison with muon decay, the Kobayashi-
Maskawa (KM) matrix element Vud, one of the parameters of the Standard
Model of elementary particle interactions [2,3].

The hypothesis that the KM matrix is unitary implies that the sum of the
squares of each row are unity. The uncertainty of the unitarity test is domi-
nated by the accuracy of the large diagonal elements Vud, Vcs, and Vtb. While at
present, the best limits on the unitarity of the KM matrix are extracted from
measurements of superallowed beta decay, in the long run study of neutron
beta decay promises to provide even better limits [4]. While it is diﬃcult to
measure Vud to 0.1%, there is no hope of measuring Vcs or Vtb to this accuracy
in the foreseeable future. It is important to note that present measurements
in the neutron sector are marginally inconsistent with the unitarity of the KM
matrix [5,6]: the value of Vud inferred from the A measurements of compara-
ble accuracy corresponds to a violation of the unitarity of the KM matrix by
about 3σ.

Also, measurements of the neutrino asymmetry B in polarized neutron decay
can be used to place interesting constraints on possible deviations from the
Standard Model in the charged current sector of the weak interaction, such
as the possible existence of right-handed weak currents [7]. It is therefore
important to improve the accuracy of these measurements.

Unfortunately, both of the most accurate measurements of the A and B coeﬃ-
cients in neutron decay suﬀer from a common limitation: the absolute accuracy
of the neutron beam polarization measurement. To signiﬁcantly improve the
measurements alternative techniques are needed. One approach is to conduct

Another strategy, and the one pursued in this work, is to develop more ac-
curate methods of measuring the polarization of neutron beams. In order to
make signiﬁcant progress, a method of absolute neutron beam polarization
measurement with an accuracy better than 0.1% is required.

Past techniques for absolute neutron beam polarization measurement in the
cold, thermal, and epithermal neutron energy ranges fall into two main classes:
(1) relative intensity measurements of the spin components in a polarized beam
after spatial separation using a magnetic ﬁeld gradient (the Stern-Gerlach ef-
fect) [9–13] and (2) transmission measurements using a second polarizing de-
vice (an analyzer) in combination with spin ﬂippers [14–20,11,21]. In principle,
both techniques can be implemented in a manner which is free of systematic
errors for monoenergetic, divergence-free neutron beams. In practice, however,
there are limitations to both of these techniques that are associated with the
phase space density of realistic neutron beams. A detailed discussion of some
of the diﬃculties that are encountered with these techniques has appeared
recently [22].

The use of polarized 3He gas targets as neutron polarizers makes possible a
promising technique for absolute neutron beam polarization measurement. For
neutrons of a given energy, there is a simple (and essentially exact) relation
between the neutron polarization Pn produced by transmission through a po-
larized target and the relative transmission of neutrons through the polarized
(Tn) and unpolarized (T 0

n ) target:

3He is an attractive target for the development of this technique. Low energy
(thermal) neutrons interact with 3He primarily by the absorption reaction
n + 3He
7 barns at 25.3 meV [37].
All other channels have comparatively small cross sections at thermal energies.
A 3He target that is thick for absorption is thin for the other reaction channels
and the equation above holds to a high degree of accuracy under realistic beam
conditions and detector geometries. Since this relation requires only relative
neutron transmission measurements, it promises to form the basis of a new
and reliable way to measure and monitor on-line the absolute polarization of
a neutron beam [23].

±

The realization of this method of neutron beam polarization measurement has

3

been made possible by recent advancements in techniques to polarize 3He gas
by optical pumping. Two methods have been developed to polarize ground
state 3He gas atoms: spin exchange with optically polarized Rb [24,26], and
optical pumping of metastable 3He followed by metastability exchange colli-
sions. Both techniques have been applied at the ILL in Grenoble and at NIST
to polarize neutron beams [27–29]. The Rb spin exchange method has been
used to produce polarized 3He targets for several particle and nuclear physics
experiments [31–34]. The ﬁrst experiment using a 3He spin ﬁlter to polarize
an epithermal neutron beam was performed at Los Alamos by Coulter et al.
in 1989 [35]. The neutron beam polarization was determined in this initial
experiment with an uncertainty of 10%. They used a dye laser to polarize
Rb atoms. Recent progress in the Rb spin exchange technique has been aided
largely by the commercial availability of high power laser diode arrays [25].

The technique described in Ref. [23] assumed that the neutron beams to be
polarized were from a CW source with a broad energy spectrum, and thus
required a set of transmission measurements through a reference cell to ef-
fectively measure the energy spectrum. At a short pulsed spallation neutron
source the energy of the neutrons can be determined very accurately using
time-of-ﬂight (TOF) techniques. In addition, the pulsed nature of the source
has other advantages in the determination of detector backgrounds and in situ
control of systematic errors (as discussed further in section 4).

In this paper, we describe the ﬁrst accurate absolute measurement of neutron
beam polarization using this technique. Our measurement, performed at the
LANSCE pulsed neutron source at Los Alamos, has achieved an absolute
accuracy of 0.3% in the neutron energy range of 40 meV to 10 eV. This
accuracy is comparable to the best previous measurements using supermirror
neutron polarizers at energies of a few meV, and to our knowledge represents
the most accurate absolute measurement of neutron beam polarization made
in this energy range. We argue that the absolute accuracy can be improved
by about an order of magnitude and that the technique can be extended to
lower neutron energies. This development therefore promises to remove one of
the obstacles to the goal of improving the accuracy of measurements of the A
and B coeﬃcients in neutron beta decay. In addition, the result is important
for the use of polarized 3He spin ﬁlters as neutron polarizers and polarization
analyzers.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Transmission of unpo-
larized neutrons through polarized gas is discussed in section 2. Section 3
discusses the LANSCE pulsed neutron source and experimental setup with
the 3He spin ﬁlter. Data analysis and results are presented in section 4 and
discussed in section 5.

Finally, we note that another approach which exploits the properties of polar-

4

ized 3He is being pursued in which 3He is used as an ideal neutron polarization
analyzer [30].

2 Neutron Transmission through Polarized 3He Gas

Polarized 3He can be used as a nearly perfect neutron-spin ﬁlter because of its
very large, spin-dependent neutron reaction cross section. In this section we
review what is known regarding the interactions of low energy neutrons with
3He and describe the operation of a neutron spin ﬁlter.

We begin by separating the interaction of low energy neutrons with 3He into
elastic and inelastic channels. We ﬁrst identify the following contributions to
the elastic cross section: (1) potential scattering of the neutron from the 3He
nucleus due to the strong interaction, (2) the electromagnetic spin-orbit inter-
action of the magnetic moment of the moving neutron with the magnetic ﬁelds
originating from the electric charge of the nucleus and bound electrons, (3) the
electromagnetic interaction of the internal charge distribution of the neutron
with the bound electrons and nucleus of the 3He atom, and (4) the electromag-
netic interaction of the induced electric dipole moment of the neutron with the
electric ﬁeld of the nucleus. In the energy range of these measurements, the
relative sizes of the scattering lengths for these processes are approximately
10−3 : 10−3 : 10−4. Clearly (1) dominates. The potential scattering
4 : 3
n + 3He is independent of neutron energy in this energy range
n + 3He
and can be spin dependent in principle. However, the elastic cross section is
small compared to the inelastic cross section in our energy range and we will
not need to know anything about the possible spin dependence of this cross
section. The electromagnetic spin-orbit scattering, which is spin dependent,
vanishes for forward scattering and is therefore also negligible.

In addition to elastic scattering, there are two inelastic channels available for
neutrons on 3He.

The energy dependence of both cross sections obeys the well known 1/v law:
σre = v0
v σ0, where σ0 is the spin averaged cross section for neutrons mov-
ing at a speed of v0 = 2200 m/s, which corresponds to a neutron energy of
25.3 meV [37]. The reaction n + 3He
4He + γ has a cross section of 54
µbarns at 25.3 meV [36] and will be ignored in the remaining discussion. Due
to the presence of a broad (400 keV) J π = 0+ excited state of the 4He com-
pound nucleus, located 650 keV below the n + 3He threshold, the reaction
n + 3He

3H + p has a very large cross section σ0 of 5333

at this energy [37]. Since this resonance is only open in the 0+ channel, the
absorption cross section is quite spin dependent. The energy dependence of
this reaction has been measured to high accuracy in this energy range, and
has been shown to obey the 1/v law [48].

To understand the spin dependence of this reaction, we consider the following
formalism. We consider the low energy regime where only l = 0 partial waves
contribute (the l = 1 contribution to the cross section at neutron energies
≤
10 eV is at the 10−4 level). For incident neutrons on a spin 1/2 target, we
deﬁne σs and σt as the cross sections for the singlet and triplet compound
states, respectively. The spin independent cross section is then:

σre =

I + 1
2I + 1

σt +

I
2I + 1

σs

and the cross section for a particular spin state (the polarized cross section)
is:

where I is the target spin. The “experimental” cross sections for neutron and
target spins parallel (+) or antiparallel (–) can be deﬁned:

where PN is the target polarization. For I = 1/2 and PN = 100%:

For the case of 3He, Passell and Schermer [38] have measured σp/σre = 1.010(32),
making:

Polarized 3He targets with 100% polarization are therefore ideal neutron po-
larizers.

and the transmission through the ﬁlter is given by

n is the transmission through the 3He cell when the 3He polarization
Here T 0
is zero. Because the absorption cross section is inversely proportional to the
neutron velocity, and the scattering cross section is nearly constant over the
energy range of interest, this relation has a simple energy dependence which
we exploit in the data analysis.

For the beam polarization we obtain equation 1 from equations 4 and 5

According to this result, we need only measure the transmission ratio (T 0

as a function of neutron energy En caused by 3He polarization to determine the
neutron beam polarization at En. We do not need to know the areal density of
the 3He, the cross sections, or the 3He polarization. Only an accurate relative
transmission measurement is required.

If the polarized 3He cell is used to analyze the neutron spin then the analyzing
power is

A = Pntanh(nlσpPHe).

Figure 1 demonstrates the useful energy range of a spin ﬁlter with a ﬁxed
3He thickness. To date the reported 3He polarizations with the rubidium spin-
exchange method in large-volume cells are in the range of 40%–70% [25,31,33].
It is then possible to build practical 3He neutron spin ﬁlters for neutron en-
ergies up to tens of eV, limited ultimately by the 1/v velocity dependence of
the neutron absorption cross section. The energy range of supermirror polar-
izers [39,40] extends from cold to thermal neutron energies, but at epithermal
energies the 3He spin ﬁlter competes only with the cryogenic polarized proton
spin ﬁlter [41], which operates by spin-dependent scattering as opposed to
spin-dependent absorption.

3 Accurate Neutron Beam Polarization Measurement

In this section we describe in detail the aspects of the neutron beamline and
experimental apparatus which are important for understanding the measure-
ments described in section 4.

3.1 LANSCE Pulsed Spallation Neutron Source

At the Manuel Lujan Neutron Scattering Center (MLNSC) at LANSCE, neu-
trons are produced by spallation. First, 500 µs-wide, 800-MeV proton pulses
are injected into the Los Alamos Proton Storage Ring (PSR). Inside the PSR,
the pulses are compressed into triangular pulses 250 ns wide at the base before
delivery to the spallation target at a rate of 20 Hz, producing unpolarized neu-
trons in the MeV energy range. The spallation target consists of two tungsten
cylinders of 20 cm diameter. The cylinders are located one above the other
along the vertical proton beam axis. The upper cylinder has a length of 7 cm,
while the lower one is 27 cm long. The gap between them is 14 cm and is sur-
rounded by moderation and reﬂector material. The horizontal ﬂight paths are
located at the level of the gap to minimize contamination of the beam from
gamma-rays and high-energy neutrons. The experiment described here was
performed on a ﬂight path with a gadolinium-poisoned water moderator and
a cadmium/boron liner. A more detailed description of the spallation source
and the associated beamline is given in [43,44].

The neutron yield from the water moderator surface has an approximately
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the eﬀective temperature of the modera-
tor, with a high-energy tail that falls oﬀ approximately like 1/En. This is shown
in ﬁgure 2, which displays the neutron ﬂux on the surface of the moderator
calculated for an average proton current of 70 µA. The peak of the neutron ﬂux
for the water moderator used in this experiment, 4
sr),
is at about 40 meV [44]. ∆N, the number of neutrons per second in the ep-
ithermal energy range with energies between E and E + ∆E in the beam, is

ﬂight path (which in this experiment was about 60 m) and the width of the
proton pulse. Further time broadening of the neutron pulse is introduced by
the neutron moderation processes and the fact that the normal of the moder-
ator surface is at a 15 degree angle with respect to the ﬂight path, leading to a
distribution of lengths of the ﬂight path of the neutrons across the beam pro-
ﬁle. When the neutrons interact with the moderator, the neutron time spread
can be described by the sum of two convolutions between a Gaussian and a
pair of exponential tails as discussed in Ref. [45]. These time broadenings have
an energy dependence. All of these eﬀects are taken into account by the code
FITXS [46] used to ﬁt the energy calibration data.

3.2 Experimental Setup

The goal of the experiment was to study polarized 3He as a neutron spin ﬁlter,
determine the accuracy of the beam polarization measurement technique, and
discover the important sources of systematic error. Figure 3 shows schemat-

The most important elements and their approximate distances from the source are

ically the main components of our experimental set up in ﬂight path 2 at
MLNSC.

A thin 3He/4He ion chamber combination was used to normalize the beam
ﬂux, with a statistical accuracy of 10−4 per neutron pulse [47]. After the beam
monitor, the neutrons were collimated to a beam of 1.1 cm in diameter. Then
the neutrons interacted with a cell of 3He, located 9 m from the source. The
3He apparatus was mounted on a movable table so that two 3He cells, one
polarized and one unpolarized, could be alternated in and out of the beam.

11

In addition to neutrons the beam contains a TOF-dependent gamma ray back-
ground. Detector backgrounds were determined by a modiﬁcation of the ab-
sorber techniques described in Ref. [49]. A 0.13 mm thick In foil and a 2.6
mm thick Ta foil were both present in the beam during the experiment. The
resonance absorption in these nuclei was used to determine the gamma back-
ground on-line — at energies corresponding to compound nuclear resonances
in these nuclei, the neutron absorption cross section is large enough that, for
these thicknesses, essentially no neutrons pass through the absorbers.

Because of the Maxwellian energy distribution of neutrons from the moderator,
a few very low-energy neutrons are present. If detected, these neutrons can
overlap in time with the faster neutrons of the next pulse (“frame overlap”) and
complicate the interpretation of the transmission data. In our measurements,
these low energy neutrons are absorbed in the 3He targets, due to the very large
cross section of neutrons on 3He at these low energies. The water moderator
is also poisoned with Gd to absorb low energy neutrons. As a result we expect
(and observed) no frame overlap in our measurements.

Collimation and shielding of the neutron beam is accomplished by a combi-
nation of brass, lead, and polyethylene loaded with either boron or lithium.
Brass collimators located immediately up-stream and downstream of the 3He
gas cell deﬁne a 1.1 cm diameter beam. A lead wall with a 10 cm square hole is
located downstream of the second set of brass collimators and limits the ﬂux of
fast neutrons entering the 40 m long evacuated beam pipe leading to the 3He
scintillation detector. A series of borated polyethylene collimators with 10 cm
diameter holes are located at regular intervals inside the beam pipe. A wall of
lithium-loaded polyethylene with a 10 cm square hole is constructed 3 m from
the detector. Attempts to locate shielding tightly around the detector were
found to increase the background. Therefore the detector was left unshielded.

Neutrons were detected with a 3He gas scintillation detector. Discriminated
PMT pulses were counted with a multiscaler. The neutron detector and asso-
ciated electronics are described in section 3.4.

3.3 3He Spin Filter

3.3.1 Polarizing 3He with the Rb spin-exchange

3He gas was polarized using the Rb-spin exchange method. Intense circularly-
polarized laser light (λ
795 nm) is used to optically pump the D1 line of Rb
atoms, polarizing them, in a glass sample cell. During binary collisions between
the 3He and atomically polarized Rb in the cell, the hyperﬁne interaction
induces polarization in the 3He. The resultant 3He polarization saturates at a

where PRb is the average Rb polarization produced by laser optical pumping
and γSE is the spin-exchange rate from the Rb to the 3He nucleus. Γ is the 3He
spin relaxation rate due to paramagnetic impurities on the cell wall and in the
gas [51–53]. Due to the slow rate of the spin exchange polarization process,
high 3He polarization requires 3He relaxation rates 1/Γ
100 hours [51].
Rb densities of 1014

1015 cm−3 are used.

Typical alkali-spin exchange apparatus can be found in Refs [25,31,33]. The
most common lasers in use for the Rb optical pumping in high density 3He
targets are Ti:sapphire lasers and high-power laser diode arrays (LDA) [25].

Two ﬁber-coupled LDAs [54] were used in this experiment. The unpolarized
laser beam from the ﬁber was ﬁrst focused and then linearly polarized with
a beam polarizing cube. The linearly polarized component, which traversed
the cube, was ﬁrst circularly polarized with a quarter wave plate and then
refocused so that the sample cell was completely covered by the light spot.
The linearly polarized component which reﬂected from the cube was redirected
parallel to the ﬁrst beam with a mirror, and then circularly polarized by a
second polarizing-cube/quarter-wave-plate pair. Thus the cylindrical 10-cm
long cell was covered with four circularly polarized round light spots. The
wavelength of the lasers were monitored by a spectrometer [55].

3.3.2 3He cells

The state of the art of the glass cell preparation for high 3He polarization is
discussed in Ref. [24]. The cell construction is designed to optimize the FOM
of the spin ﬁlter and meet practical considerations as well. The cells of this
experiment were 10 cm long and 3.5 cm in diameter. The cylindrical part of the
cell was produced from reblown Corning 1720 aluminosilicate glass with a wall
thickness of about 3 mm. The ends of the cell, the neutron beam windows were
made from 3 mm thick ﬂat disks using 10B-free and low-iron content Corning
1720 glass. 10B has a large neutron capture cross section at thermal energies
and would produce signiﬁcant beam attenuation if present in the windows. Six
cells were prepared for the experiment. The cells were loaded with 67 mbar
of N2 and 3 – 11 bar 3He corresponding to 3He densities of 1
×
1021 cm−2. A destructive pressure test with water was performed with a few
cells which had the same design. The maximum pressure before the burst was
measured to be about 16 bar. The 3He polarization time constants varied from
40 h to 60 h. The cell used for this measurement had 3.3 bar 3He, for a 3He
1020 cm−2, and a measured relaxation time of approximately
density of 8.4

neutron beam to be 45%. Due to technical diﬃculties, this polarization could
not be maintained, and the average polarization achieved for the measurement
was near 20%. The 3He polarization direction was perpendicular to the neutron
beam. The 86-cm diameter coils in the Helmholtz conﬁguration were used to
provide the holding ﬁeld of 3.0 mT. The 3He polarization was monitored by
the adiabatic fast passage method [56,35].

The oven required to control the Rb density in the sample cell contained two
almost identical 3He cells. One of the cells was continuously polarized by two
lasers: the second cell, which contained approximately the same amount of
3He as the ﬁrst, did not have any Rb so the 3He nuclei were not polarized.
This cell was used as a reference cell. The cells were kept at temperature
of about 175 oC for the optimum Rb density. The whole 3He apparatus was
mounted on a movable table which allowed the cells to be alternated into and
out of the beam every two minutes by switching the position of the table whose
position was controlled with an accuracy of 0.2 mm. In one table position 2400
neutron pulses were accumulated, after which the table was moved to the other
position. Each two-position cycle comprises one run. The data acquisition
system separated information between the polarized cell and reference cell.

3.4 3He Scintillation Counter

A 3He scintillation detector was chosen as the transmission detector for its high
eﬃciency in this neutron energy range, fast time response (
100 nsec), and
insensitivity to gamma rays. The 3He scintillation detector utilizes the same
large capture cross section for neutrons on 3He that is used in the polarizer:
n + 3He
p + 3H + 767 keV . Because the capture cross section depends
on the neutron energy, the 3He thickness in the detector can be selected so
that it has the optimum stopping power for the neutrons of interest. Thus the
neutron detection eﬃciency of the cell with a given pressure depends on the
neutron energy. However, since the neutron kinetic energy is small compared
to the Q value of the reaction, the pulse height of the neutron capture event
by 3He is constant.

→

≈

The products from the reaction, triton and proton, have kinetic energy of
575 keV and 192 keV, respectively. The triton has a mean free path of 0.9 bar-
cm in 3He gas and the proton mean-free path is 5.83 bar-cm. In the experiment
we used a single cylindrical 3He scintillation detector cell with a diameter of
5 cm and length of 5 cm. We used typically 8 bar of 3He in the detector cell.
The great majority of capture events deposit all their energy in the detector.
The detector eﬃciency is then given by the neutron absorption in the cell:

Depth (cm)

Fig. 4. Transmission proﬁle for neutrons in the 3He scintillator detectors. As a
function of neutron energy, it can be determined that the average transmission
depth in the detector is given by equation 14.

A small correction must be made to the detector eﬃciency when neutrons
are captured near the wall of the detector, and subsequently do not deposit
all their energy within the detector. This eﬀect is energy dependent, since
low energy neutrons have a higher absorption cross section and are therefore
captured nearer the front of the detector (see ﬁgure 4). Since we require only a
transmission ratio, and the eﬃciency and “wall eﬀect” are spin-independent,
for the neutron polarization measurements no corrections need be made to
the raw data to account for these eﬀects. However, the energy dependence of
the eﬃciency has a small eﬀect on the calibration of the neutron TOF data in
terms of neutron energy (discussed in section 4.2).

The detector cell was made from aluminum with a 5 mm thick entrance window
for neutrons at the end of the cylinder. Scintillation light was detected through
a 3 mm thick sapphire window which was mounted on the other end of the
cylinder and was sealed with a Viton O-ring. The photomultiplier tube was a
2 inch diameter Amperex XP2262B which provided a fast rise time (2.0 nsec)
and a good quantum eﬃciency (28% at 400 nm).

The two charged particles, proton and triton, from the capture reaction pro-
duce vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) scintillation light in 3He gas through de-
excitations of short-lived 3He quasi-molecules [57]. The n-3He reaction is esti-
1-2 VUV photons per keV in 3He gas. It was impractical
mated to produce
in our case to eﬃciently detect VUV photons. Therefore, the inside walls of
the cell were coated with a wavelength shifter (WLS) to convert the VUV
light to the visible region. The WLS was tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB, 1,1,4,4-
Tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene; Fluka 88020). The ﬂuorescence eﬃciency of TPB
has been studied recently by McKinsey et al. [58]. After the coatings were
70o C and pumped to a
made, the cell was held at a temperature of 60
pressure below 1.3

10−6 mbar for a day.

To increase the light output and improve the pulse height resolution, 7% of
Xe gas by volume was added [59]. Figure 5 shows the pulse height distribution
with the 3He-Xe mixture measured with thermal neutrons.

Pulses from the photomultiplier tube were fanned into three separate integral
level discriminators whose outputs are in turn recorded in scalers. The ﬁrst
of the discriminator-scaler pairs is used to determine the neutron yield from
which the transmission ratio is extracted, and is described in more detail in
Sec. 3.5. The remaining two discriminator-scaler pairs are used to stabilize the
gain of the photomultiplier tube. These discriminators are set at 60 mV and
120 mV, respectively. The lower discriminator is set in the minimum of the
pulse height distribution from the detector and counts essentially all of the
neutron events. The upper discriminator is centered at the peak of the pulse
height distribution and has a count rate about half that of the lower level
discriminator. At approximately ﬁve minute intervals, the data acquisition
system reads both scaler values and adjusts the voltage of the photomultiplier
tube until the scaler value associated with the 60 mV discriminator is approx-
imately twice that of the 120 mV one. By this method the gain of the PMT
was stabilized to the 1% level. Given the spectrum of pulse height shapes and
the location of the discriminator windows, this stability suﬃces to reduce the
ﬂuctuation of the number of recorded neutron counts due to detector gain
changes to a value which was below counting statistics.

3.5 Data Acquisition System

Pulses from the 3He scintillator are ﬁrst passed through a 100 ns ﬁlter for
shaping. They are then passed through a 10
ampliﬁer before being pulse-
height discriminated and recorded in an Ortec T914 [50] multiscaler that is
divided into 9625 bins. Individual neutron counts are accumulated in a single
multiscaler bin for a preset length of time, tdwell, until an external oscillator
signals the multiscaler to advance to the next bin. The data are thus stored as

of ﬂight.

When the last TOF bin has been reached, the multiscaler returns to the ﬁrst
bin and waits for the next beam burst, which is preceded by a start signal from
the proton storage ring. The same start signal triggers a countdown scaler set
at 2400. New counts in each TOF bin are accumulated on top of those from
the previous beam burst until the countdown scaler reaches zero. At this time
data acquisition is halted, and the data stored in the multiscaler is written
to disk. This process requires approximately one minute, during which the
translation table for the target and empty cells is moved to the next position.
The countdown scaler is reset to 2400, the multiscaler is cleared, and data

acquisition recommences only after the multiscaler is ﬁnished writing to disk
and the position transducer indicates that the translation table is in the correct
position. Each target-in, target-out cycle comprises one run.

The multiscaler is read into CAMAC through a Kinetic Systems model 3344 se-
rial line communication interface. The data-acquisition is based in VME, with
online sorting handled on an HP-workstation by the XSYS data-acquisition
package, as developed at IUCF [60].

4 Data Analysis and Results

In this section we describe the details of the measurement strategy, the data
analysis, and the results.

4.1 Accurate neutron beam polarization measurement with transmission

The following method, which is a slight modiﬁcation of the technique outlined
earlier (deﬁned by equation 1), was used to measure the neutron polarization.
Both a target cell and a reference cell were placed on a translating table.
Transmission through the target cell (polarized and unpolarized) was normal-
ized by the transmission through the unpolarized reference cell. The relative
normalization was measured every six minutes, thus reducing the eﬀects of
time-dependent drifts in the properties of various parts of the system to neg-
ligible levels.

To determine the neutron beam polarization, we ﬁrst obtained the ratio of the
transmissions through the unpolarized target cell (T 0
n ) and the reference cell
(T ref,1
n

):

K =

T 0

The factor K is energy dependent, and dominated by the diﬀerences in the
3He and window thicknesses for the two cells. We then polarized the target
cell, and obtained the ratio of the transmissions through the target cell while
polarized, Tn, and the reference cell (always unpolarized), T ref,2
. From equa-
tion 5 we obtain the ratio of these transmissions

in the argument need be known. Figure 6 shows the transmission enhancement
caused by 3He polarization as a function of neutron energy.

4.2 Neutron Time-of-Flight (TOF) and Energy Calibration

The neutron energy is determined by TOF, which for nonrelativistic neutrons
is inversely proportional to the square-root of the neutron energy. For opti-
mal resolution a long ﬂight path and ﬁne time binning are important. For
this reason, and also to avoid a number of systematic eﬀects associated with
non-forward neutron scattering from the 3He target, the neutron detector is
located approximately 60 m away from the neutron source and more than
50 m from the 3He target. Calibration of the TOF in terms of neutron energy
is determined by installing thin ﬁlms of 238U and natural Ir into the beam.
These nuclei possess neutron resonances whose absolute energies are known
to 0.1% or better (see table 1). Using the FITXS routine mentioned earlier,
the centroid channel number of each of these resonances was extracted and
correlated with the resonance energy. FITXS takes into account details of
the beamline geometry and moderator properties including the emission time
distribution of the neutrons from the moderator as a function of TOF.

The neutron motion is nonrelativistic to an excellent approximation and the
relation between the neutron kinetic energy and the TOF parameters is given
by

where Mn is the neutron mass, Lave is the average path length from the source

is the size (in µs) allocated for each TOF channel, and tof f is a timing oﬀset
associated with the electronic start signal. Fitting the known energies of these
resonances to the centroid of the channel number at which they appear in
the neutron TOF spectra, we extract the TOF parameters Lave and tof f for

neutrons of energies between 0.65 and 190 eV.

The oﬀset is dependent on the dwell time of each TOF channel. For the 5.0
µs channels used in this measurement, an oﬀset of tof f = 8.72(3) µs was
determined from the ﬁt. This uncertainty, which contributes at levels below
0.1% starting at channel i = 30 while our analysis begins at channel 300 (see
ﬁgure 7), makes negligible contributions to the ﬁnal uncertainty.

The average path length extracted was Lave = 59.752(1) m, a value domi-
nated by the high energy resonances used for TOF calibration. However, a
correction to the path length must be made due to the energy dependent neu-
tron penetration depth in the detector, which contributes strongly at energies
lower than those used in the calibration. The probability that a neutron will
be absorbed at a given depth d in the detector is proportional to the neutron
transmission to that depth, deﬁned as T 0
ndσre). A series of absorp-
tion proﬁles are shown in ﬁgure 4. It may be shown (using equation 5, and the
1/v dependence of the neutron capture cross section as discussed in section 2)

En < 0.1 eV ), where it approaches 2 cm, and nearly negligible at energies
above those used in the ﬁtting routines, (En > 0.65 eV ). The uncertainty
in this correction is due to the uncertainty in the precise knowledge of the

the energy scale is then 0.08% at high energies and 0.02% at lower energies

22

(see ﬁgure 11).

4.3 Backgrounds

The largest source of backgrounds in this measurement are from fast neu-
trons scattered and moderated in the beam pipe and neutrons produced in
secondary reactions at the source. These neutrons can reach the detector at
a time diﬀerent from their equal energy counterparts and thus blur the sim-
ple relation between neutron kinetic energy and TOF. The ﬁrst source was
greatly reduced by modiﬁcations to the collimation and shielding described
previously. A lead wall was introduced to reduce the number of fast neutrons
that enter the evacuated beam pipe. Within the beam pipe, the collimation is
entirely 10B and 6Li doped polyethylene, which moderates and absorbs the ex-
traneous neutrons rather than scattering them and forming secondary sources
themselves. Other sources of backgrounds are small by comparison. Due to
its low atomic number, the 3He scintillator is relatively insensitive to gammas
present in the neutron beam. Cosmic rays background rates are low compared
to the 20 kHz neutron counting rates.

A typical TOF spectrum for this experiment is shown in Figure 7. Neutron
resonances cause the dips in the transmission spectra. The resonances in this
ﬁgure are from In and Ta foils inserted in the beam (Table 2), chosen because
they possess large compound nuclear resonances at precisely known neutron
energies. The thicknesses of the In and Ta samples were chosen to make them
opaque to neutrons at these resonance energies. Consequently, any counts
observed beneath one of these dips are either background counts or neutrons
of slightly diﬀerent energy which arrive at the resonance energy TOF due
primarily to the spread of emission times from the moderator. The background
rates were measured underneath these black resonances and at long TOF,
where the low energy neutrons are absorbed by the 3He in the beam. The
rates are then normalized to the neutron beam ﬂux as measured by the beam
monitor. Except for small TOF which is outside the region of our analysis,
the background rates are well described by the expression:

˜Nbkgnd =

ai/ti,

3

i=0
X

(16)

where ˜N bkgnd is the measured background per channel, and t is the channel
number (see ﬁgure 7). The background is energy dependent, ranging from
0.2% at 10 eV down to 0.06% at 1.0 eV and back up to 1.5% at 40 meV.
The extracted ﬁts of the backgrounds to the above expression are accurate to
better than 7%, with the subsequent uncertainty in the transmission maximal

4.4 Deadtime and Pulse Pileup

If two or more events in the 3He scintillator with energies below the discrimi-
nator threshold overlap in time, the discriminator may register a count despite
the fact that both events occur beneath the discriminator threshold. We call
this pulse pileup: it increases the observed count rate relative to the true neu-
tron rate at the detector. In addition, the detector-electronics combination is
rendered insensitive for a brief time after an event is registered. We call this
deadtime: it decreases the observed count rate relative to the true neutron
rate.

Pulse pileup and deadtime eﬀects are diﬃcult to model reliably. We therefore
decided to measure the net eﬀects of deadtime and pulse pileup experimen-
tally. The ﬁrst aspect of our measurement strategy is to keep the deadtime and
pileup corrections small. The 3He detectors have a response time of approxi-
mately 100ns. Instantaneous counting rates at the detector were intentionally
reduced by the beam collimation to less than 50kHz (20 kHz with 3He in the
0.2%.
beam). An order of magnitude estimate of the deadtime losses is then

∼

The next aspect of our strategy is to ensure that the deadtime/pileup correc-
tions are dominated by processes occuring in the detector and not later on in
the electronics chain. The ORTEC multiscaler possessed a 7 nsec deadtime,
and the pulse width from the discriminator was 20 nsec. Both of these values
are smaller than the width of the pulses from the detector, and therefore none
of the electronics at or after the discriminator contribute to the deadtime.

24

To ﬁrst order, the observed yield Y at the detector is then given by:

Y = R(1

Rτ )

−

(17)

where Y (Hz) is the observed rate, R(Hz) is the true rate, and τ (sec) is a
parameter which includes the eﬀects of both deadtime and pileup. This relation
is good for Rτ

1, which our system satisﬁes.

≪

To determine this parameter τ , we performed a measurement of the total cross
section on a nucleus whose neutron cross section is independent of energy.
Measurements of the neutron total cross section may be performed with our
apparatus by replacing the two 3He cells with the sample. The cross section
is given in terms of measured parameters by:

where σ is the total neutron-target cross section, n is the number density of
atoms in the target, l is the target thickness, and Rout and Rin are the true
rates for the target out and target in the beam respectively. Using only the
approximation that the deadtime correction is small, these equations may be
combined to extract the deadtime parameter, τ :

σ =

ln(

σmeas = σtrue

(18)

(19)

where σmeas is the uncorrected cross-section with no deadtime corrections
applied to the transmission data (background corrections are included), σtrue
is the true cross section of the sample, and ∆R is the sample in versus sample
out diﬀerence in rates (Hz).

Total cross section measurements on a single carbon sample at four diﬀer-
ent detector counting rates from approximately 20kHz to 120kHz were per-
formed. Carbon was chosen because it has a total cross section which has been
accurately measured and is independent of neutron energy to an excellent ap-
proximation in this energy range [61]. The rates were changed by varying the
thicknesses of Pb attenuators and In and Ta ﬁlters in the beam. The extracted
cross sections for the four measurements were then compared over nine dif-
ferent energy regimes. The measured cross sections were plotted versus the
diﬀerence in rates to extract the deadtime parameter from the slope of the
curve. This measurement of the deadtime parameter yields τ = 47(7) ns, which
is a reasonable value given the 100 ns response of the detectors coupled with
pileup eﬀects.

0.1% at the higher
neutron energy, 0.01 – 0.025% at lower neutron energy. We exploit the fact
that, since we perform a relative transmission measurement, we are sensitive
ultimately only to the diﬀerence in deatime/pileup corrections for the polarized
and unpolarized 3He — the correction to the transmission ratio is proportional
to τ ∆R. The diﬀerence in thicknesses of the reference and target cells was

4.5 Results

We constructed a model based on the operation of the neutron polarizer as
outlined in the introduction and on the behavior of the neutron cross sec-
tion on 3He discussed in Section 2 and used it to ﬁt our data. 211 runs were
accumulated with the target cell unpolarized, 119 with the target polarized.
Additional runs were accumulated while the target was being polarized. The
rise of the 3He polarization is very nearly an exponential, with possible de-
viations due to ﬂuctuations in Rb density (from temperature ﬂuctuations),
for example. By observing the change in transmission as the 3He polarization
slowly increased, we extracted the rise time of the polarization, τrise = 6.0
0.2
hours, and the asymptotic value of the transmission parameter nlσpPHe. The
119 “polarization” runs were accumulated with the 3He initially within 0.8%
of the asymptotic transmission, with later runs within 0.1%. For each run
the transmission through each 3He cell was normalized to the beam monitor,
and corrected for background and deadtime/pileup eﬀects. The transmission
through the polarized 3He cell was then scaled at each run by a factor:

±

F = cosh(nlσpPHe,asym)/ cosh(nlσpPHe)

(20)

from equation 5, where PHe,asym is the asymptotic value of the 3He polar-
ization, and the polarization in the denominator is determined by the time
constant noted above. The runs were then summed together to improve the
statistics for analysis. The eﬀect of the scaling was negligible at high energies
(for En > 1.0 eV , the average eﬀect was 0.0
0.002(3)%) and largest
at low energies (for En

Following the experimental procedure outlined in section 4.1, we ﬁrst consider
the unpolarized target runs. The transmission ratio for both target and

where ∆(nl) is the diﬀerence in the 3He thicknesses, and the coeﬃcient C
allows for an energy independent diﬀerence in transmission (due to diﬀerences
in potential scattering from the windows of the glass cells, for example). Since
the cross section follows the well known 1/v dependence described earlier, this
relation can be rewritten as a function of TOF:

K = exp[∆(nl)

where σ0 is the cross section at the neutron energy E0, Mn is the neutron
mass, L is the ﬂight path length, t is the neutron time of ﬂight, tof f is the
oﬀset between the start of the beam burst and the start of counting at the
data acquisition system. A ﬁt to the transmission data for both cells unpo-
larized yields a measured diﬀerence in target and reference cell thicknesses
of ∆(nl) = 2.896(3) barn−1 (consistent with a target cell thickness of
33
40 bar-cm). A was measured to be
bar-cm and a reference cell thickness of

A ﬁt of the transmission data to this functional form yields the product
nlPHeσ0√E0 = .1583(4) √eV . Presuming a
30 bar-cm target, this cor-
responds to a 3He polarization of
20%. The uncertainty in this parameter
yields an energy dependent statistical uncertainty that varies from 0.3% at
40 meV to 0.01% at 10 eV. Systematic eﬀects, dominated by uncertainties
in backgrounds, deadtime/pileup eﬀects, energy calibration, and the time de-
pendence of the target polarization (see the following section) contribute an
additional energy dependent error, which peaks at high and low energies near
0.1%. At a neutron energy of 0.1 eV, the neutron polarization is 0.4616(15).
The polarization as a function of energy given by this ﬁt is shown with the
data in ﬁgure 9.

is estimated to be 0.16%. Achievement of the 0.1% absolute accuracy goal for
this measurement, with the given neutron ﬂux, would require either 2.5 times
the total run time (from 33 hours to 82.5 hours) or an improvement in 3He
polarization to 32% or better.

There are a number of small systematic eﬀects which must be considered
to assess the absolute accuracy of this technique. The transmission formula
gives the polarization of the neutrons under the following assumptions: (1)
the rate of removal of the polarized 3He atoms from the target by the beam
is negligible, (2) the neutron beam is perfectly collimated and the neutron
scattering in the target is negligible in comparison with the absorption cross
section, so that all of the neutrons pass through the same length of target, (3)
multiple scattering into the forward direction is negligible, (4) the neutrons
are not depolarized as they pass out of the 3He by spin-ﬂip scattering in the
window, (5) the spin-dependent attenuation of the neutrons in 3He is the only
neutron spin-dependent process in the target, (6) changes in the kinetic energy
of the neutrons as they pass into and out of the holding magnetic ﬁeld and

of window materials and the scattering cross section of 3He itself.

In Table 3 we show a list of systematic eﬀects from various sources for the
target conditions in our experiment. We have included all known eﬀects which
modify the transmission expression by at least 0.01% in the energy range of
our measurement. The largest systematic eﬀect is due to the slowly rising 3He
polarization, an eﬀect which may be made negligible if more time is available
for ramping up the 3He polarization. Otherwise, deadtime/pileup corrections,
detector backgrounds and energy calibration give the largest eﬀects, which are
at the 0.02% level. These eﬀects are plotted as a function of neutron energy
in ﬁgure 11. For this reason we are conﬁdent that it is possible to improve the
absolute accuracy of this technique to the 0.02% level.

One question that arises is whether or not all of the techniques described
in this measurement can be extrapolated to the lower neutron energies of
interest in fundamental physics experiments. For example, it becomes imprac-
tical to calibrate the neutron TOF spectrum by transmission through neutron
resonances with absolutely known resonance energies, since such resonances
broaden and disappear as one approaches neutron threshold. One alternative
to this procedure which is well-suited to a transmission measurement is to use
the sharp change in transmission through polycrystalline solids at neutron en-
ergies corresponding to Bragg scattering conditions. The discontinuity in the
total cross section for neutron energies above and below the Bragg condition
is clearly visible in a neutron TOF transmission spectrum and occurs at a
well-deﬁned neutron energy. In addition, the pulse height resolution of the
3He scintillator detector will worsen as the low energy neutrons are absorbed
close to the detector wall and the reaction products do not deposit the full en-
ergy of the reaction into the gas. The neutron detector eﬃciency then develops
an energy dependence which is inﬂuenced directly by the detector geometry.
This problem can be avoided by using a detector not based on absorption
in helium gas. The sensitivity of the detector to gamma backgrounds must
then be assessed. Finally, in many cases it may not be practical to locate the

31

transmission detector so far from the polarized target. In this case all of the
systematic eﬀects not important for our geometry must be evaluated in detail
to judge the limit to absolute accuracy.

6 Summary

Using a laser-polarized 3He spin ﬁlter we have measured the absolute neu-
tron beam polarization from 40 meV to 10 eV with an absolute accuracy of
0.3%, where 0.2% is from counting statistics, and 0.1% is the systematic error.
The measurement was performed with 3He polarized to about 20% with the
Rb-spin exchange method. We have demonstrated that the simplicity of the
mechanism of neutron polarization in polarized 3He gas allows for a new and
reliable way of measuring and monitoring on-line the absolute polarization of
a low energy neutron beam to better than 0.1%. The use of 3He spin ﬁlters
to measure and monitor the beam polarization does not require a spin ﬂipper
or analyzer. It depends only upon the well deﬁned relationship for neutron
transmission through polarized 3He gas. The 3He ﬁlter provides a possibility
for continuous online measurement and control of the neutron polarization.
The extension of the technique to lower neutron energies is straightforward.

In addition to the fundamental neutron physics applications, the development
of neutron polarizers and analyzers based on 3He spin ﬁlters is important for
neutron scattering. Neutron scattering studies in the thermal and epithermal
energy range have suﬀered for years from a lack of a convenient source of
polarized neutrons. With a 3He spin ﬁlter the useful range can be expanded
to epithermal neutron wavelengths.

One of the advantages of the 3He spin ﬁlter is its simpliﬁed experimental con-
ﬁguration. One does not require any major modiﬁcations to the beamline for a
beam polarization measurement to be made. Compact conﬁgurations are pos-
sible because there will be no gamma production and the 3He ﬁlter has a large
acceptance angle, allowing the ﬁlter and experiment to be mounted close to
the source. The accurate absolute measurement described in this work demon-
strates that the simple relations between the polarized target parameters and
the neutron transmission and polarization are satisﬁed to high accuracy in
practical polarized 3He devices.

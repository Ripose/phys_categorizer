Abstract. This paper discusses an electron energy analyzer with a cylindrically symmetrical electrostatic ﬁeld, designed
for rapid Auger analysis. The device was designed and built. The best parameters of the analyzer were estimated and then
experimentally veriﬁed.

INTRODUCTION

One of the nearly nondestructive methods to examine
surfaces of materials is the analysis of Auger electrons.
These have energies from the range roughly from 50 to
2000 eV and are emitted from the top few nanometers
giving unique valuable surface sensitivity. Most common
sequential analyzers, such as CMA or CHA, are used.
Although many tens of percents of emitted electrons can
be collected by some analyzers, this still may not be
sufﬁcient for fast analysis, because energies are analyzed
sequentially. Each time the particular detection energy is
changed, there is a dead time needed by the system to
get into the desired state. Such analyzers then need much
more time to obtain a spectrum. This can be a serious
issue for time dependent experiments, if the sample can
be easily damaged by the electron beam, or if a spectrum
is acquired for each pixel in an entire image.

In general, in order to reduce the time needed to ac-
quire a spectrum, either the solid angle intercepted by
the analyzer can be increased, or parallel detection can
be employed. It was shown in [1] that it is possible to
acquire the entire energy spectrum of interest simultane-
ously. The basis of the analyzer used was the two dimen-
sional hyperbolic ﬁeld [2][7].

The approach in this work is the development of an
analyzer that keeps all the advantages of parallel acqui-
sition and that also has a possibility to increase the solid
angle by adding cylindrical symmetry with a new focus-
ing property. The advantage of this solution is a further
decrease of the time needed to acquire the spectrum.

cylindrically symmetrical ﬁeld (right-hand side). The trajec-
tories in the cylindrically symmetrical ﬁeld are focused onto
the detector, increasing the detected signal. Another focusing
property is added.

CYLINDRICALLY SYMMETRICAL
ELECTROSTATIC FIELD

There are several conditions for the electrostatic ﬁeld to
be usable for electron energy analysis. First, Laplace’s
equation has to be satisﬁed. The trajectories of the elec-
trons analyzed by the ﬁeld have to be focused in the de-
tector plane. In this case, because the ﬁeld has cylindrical
symmetry, there must be the axis to axis focusing prop-
erty of the ﬁeld [3]. This means that the electrons starting
from one point on the axis are focused back to the axis of
symmetry, on which the detector is situated. The electro-
static ﬁeld satisfying all above conditions may be deﬁned
by the potential:

j = V0z log(r/R0),

(1)

q

where V0 is a constant characterizing the strength of
the ﬁeld, R0 is the internal radius, below which there
is no ﬁeld, r and z are cylindrical coordinates. Knowing
the potential, the equations of motion in the cylindrical
coordinate system can be written:

m(¨r − r ˙q 2) = −qV0z/r

m(r ¨q + 2˙r ˙q ) = 0

m¨z = −qV0 log(r/R0).

z [m]

When the axis to axis focusing mode is employed, it can
be supposed that the particles are starting from the axis,
and thus the angular component of the velocity is zero.
Then the equations of motion can be simpliﬁed to:

m¨r = −qV0zR0/r
¨q = 0
m¨z = −qV0 log(r/R0).

(3)

In contrast to the hyperbolic ﬁeld case [2], this set of dif-
ferential equations does not have an analytical solution;
it has to be integrated numerically. The trajectories were
calculated using the Runge-Kutta integration method [6].
It is also necessary to ﬁnd the parameters of the ﬁeld
that produce the best focusing and thus also the best res-
olution for a speciﬁed solid angle of acceptance. One
possible solution of this problem is using a minimiza-
tion algorithm. In this case for various energies several
trajectories were modeled. The sum of squares of devia-
tions of the endpoint positions is a satisfactory function
to minimize.

From the trajectories of electrons in the ﬁeld it is pos-
sible to calculate the dispersion and the best reachable
resolution of the analyzer employing this kind of electro-
static ﬁeld.

The dispersion can be calculated just from the central
trajectory for each energy. Instead of the traditional deﬁ-
nition of the dispersion,

Dr(E) = E¶ z/¶ E,

where the dispersion is relative to the energy, the absolute
dispersion,

Da(E) = ¶ z/¶ E,

is more suitable. For the CMA or other analyzers, where
the detected energy is tuned, the relative deﬁnition is
more applicable, because then the dispersion is nearly
independent of energy. For the parallel analyzer the ab-
solute deﬁnition is more suitable for the same reason.

A similar problem is the deﬁnition of the resolution.

In case of the CMA the relative deﬁnition is used.

The reason is again the fact that this value is almost con-
stant. For the same reason, in the case of the cylindrically
symmetrical ﬁeld analyzer or hyperbolic ﬁeld analyzer
(HFA) the absolute deﬁnition is more suitable.

Ra(E) = D E(E)

To be able to calculate the best possible resolution
(the resolution affected only by the properties of the
electrostatic ﬁeld) for each energy a set of calculated
endpoints of electron trajectories is needed. Because the
analytical expressions of the trajectories are not known,
whole trajectories have to be calculated instead of the
endpoints only. The calculation then takes more time
than in case of the HFA.

Calculation of the trajectories and their endpoints
showed that for different angles of entry different end-
points are obtained as expected. When the entry angle is
increased, the endpoint is getting farther, until a turning-
point is reached. Then the detected coordinate is decreas-
ing. See Fig. 2b. In fact, the existence of this turning-
point enables focusing (ﬁrst order focusing in this case).
The dependence of the endpoint coordinate on the angle
of entry can be very well approximated by a cubic poly-
nomial for all energies. The coefﬁcients of such polyno-
mials are then dependent on energy and can be also very
well approximated by quadratic polynomials. The de-
tected coordinate of the endpoint can then be expressed
as

z(E, y ) =

ki jE iy

j.

The coefﬁcients ki j can be calculated, and then from
(4) any number of endpoints can be interpolated. Then
it is possible to calculate resolution from the histogram
of positions, (Fig. 2c) and dependence of the endpoint
position on electron energy, which is in fact the integral
of the dispersion. See Fig. 2d. For the resolution, the D z
is deﬁned. In this case, the density of endpoint positions
(PSF in this case) is divergent, because of the existence
of turning-points. D z must be deﬁned as the distance
between 20%—80% of the distribution function. The
D z varies with energy. The calculation showed that the
absolute dispersion Da is very close to a constant. See
Fig. 2d. Thus

D E = D z/Da.

The modeling of the trajectories in the analytical ﬁeld
showed that the best focus is obtained when the energies
of the analyzed electrons are between 1000 eV and 2000
eV instead of the desired range of 50 eV—1000 eV,
considering that the position of the detector is given. It
is possible to use this higher range of energies by placing
an accelerator in front of the analyzer entrance.

SIMULATIONS

To create a real analyzer with a ﬁeld that has the same
analytical properties as the ﬁeld deﬁned by Eq. 1,

electrodes of a particular shape have to be used. The
outer shape of the analytical area of the analyzer is
determined by the geometry of the chamber, electron
column and detectors. The electrodes must be placed
where the equipotentials cross the outer shape of the
analyzer. These electrode shapes are then analytically
calculated, and the shape functions are obtained. In some
cases the problem leads to transcendental equations, and
numerical methods must then be used.

To examine the behavior of the analyzed electrons in
the real analyzer, which is created by charged electrodes,
simulation software can be used. The CPO [5] software
was suitable for this 3D pure electrostatic problem. This
software uses the boundary integral method to calculate
the value of the electrostatic potential at any particular
point in the analyzer. It can also be used to calculate the
trajectories of analyzed electrons. The boundary integral
method is based on calculations of charge distributions
on electrodes. Therefore the electrode shapes had to be
divided into a set of smaller triangular or rectangular seg-
ments. When the charge distribution is known, electron
motion within the ﬁeld can be simulated and for each
electron a trajectory endpoint can be obtained. For the
endpoints obtained from CPO-3D simulation Eq. (4) is
also valid and the coefﬁcients may be calculated. Out of
them it is possible to ﬁgure out the resolution and the
dispersion.

THE DEVICE

Fig. 4a shows a photograph of the device. The analyzer
must satisfy several conditions to be usable in an ultra-
high-vacuum electron microscope system:

• The analyzer must ﬁt into the chamber and not

collide with other parts of the microscope.

• Only ultra-high-vacuum compatible materials must

be used.

• All parts of the analyzer have to be bakeable. They

must stable at higher temperatures.

• Magnetic materials must be avoided.

The conditions above strongly limit the usable materials.
The device had to be designed with respect to the system
used. In this case the experiment took place in the elec-
tron microscopy laboratory at the Department of Physics

of the University of York, UK. In the past a hyperbolic
ﬁeld analyzer was used in this system and the new cylin-
drically symmetrical ﬁeld system was designed to work
in the same position in the microscope. Therefore, the
new analyzer had to have similar shape. The shapes of
the electrodes were then calculated according to this re-
quirement.

PEEK and Kapton materials were used for the insu-
lating parts of the device. Both materials are very stable
at high temperatures and utra-high-vacuum compatible.
The PEEK was used to make insulating spacers. The top
cover was made of Kapton. The electrodes were accu-
rately etched of stainless steal sheet. The side covers and
lower cylindrical electrode were made of an aluminium
alloy.

A set of two concentric hemispheres was used as
the accelerator, which produces the radial electrostatic

ﬁeld, accelerates the electrons emitted from the sample,
and decelerates primary electrons before they land on
the sample. The point where the primary beam hits the
specimen has to be in the center of the hemispheres.
As an inlet and outlet for electrons, two round holes
need to be drilled in the hemispheres. These affect the
electron trajectories because they form a lens, but the
negative effect on the trajectories entering the analyzer is
signiﬁcant only at the lowest energies. At higher energies
this effect is negligible.

The analyzer was developed and built in the Institute
of Scientiﬁc Instruments, Academy of Sciences of the
Czech Republic.

EXPERIMENT

The analyzer was used to verify the previous ideas and
calculations and to demonstrate that the cylindrically
symmetrical ﬁeld can be successfully used in parallel
energy analysis. The analyzer was inserted into an ul-
tra high vacuum system equipped with an electrostatic
column. The pressure in the sample chamber was on the
order of 10−8 Pa. As a sample a piece of copper foil was
used, although the sample was not cleaned. For a detector
the electrons were multiplied by micro channel plate and
then converted to light quanta with a phosphor screen.
The image on the screen was then photographed through
a vacuum window using Konica-Minolta Z3 digital cam-
era.

CONCLUSION

From the simulation, the absolute dispersion is nearly
constant at 1.97 × 10−2mm · eV−1 The resolution varies
from 10 eV to 2 eV, for most energies keeps below 2
eV, which well corresponds to [4]. The result of the
experiment is a 400 pixel long spectrum. (See Fig. 4.)
The relaxation peak is 1 pixel wide, which shows that
the energy resolution is better than 3 eV (Fig. 4d) at
1500 eV, which satisﬁes the theoretical estimations. The
experiment also showed the cylindrical focusing. In the
photograph of the screen (Fig. 4b) different widths of
illuminated area can be seen. These may be caused by a
slight misalignment that occurred during bake-out. This
fact also affects the signal levels of different channels.
The peak between 300 eV and 500 eV is partially caused
by carbon (the main matter covering the surface of the
sample) because the sample was not cleaned.

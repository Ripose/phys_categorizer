CONSTRUCTION AND TESTS OF MODULES FOR THE ATLAS
PIXEL DETECTOR

ABSTRACT

The ATLAS Pixel Detector is the innermost layer of the ATLAS tracking system
and will contribute signiﬁcantly to the ATLAS track and vertex reconstruction. The
detector consists of identical sensor-chip-hybrid modules, arranged in three barrels
in the centre and three disks on either side for the forward region.

The position of the pixel detector near the interaction point requires ex-
cellent radiation hardness, mechanical and thermal robustness, good long-term sta-
bility, all combined with a low material budget. The pre-production phase of such
pixel modules has nearly ﬁnished, yielding fully functional modules. Results are
presented of tests with these modules.

1 Module Layout

A pixel module consists of a single n-on-n silicon sensor, approx. 2×6 cm2 in size.
The sensor is subdivided into 47,268 pixels which are connected individually to 16
front-end (FE) chips via ”bumps”. These chips are connected to a module-control
chip (MCC) mounted on a kapton-ﬂex-hybrid glued onto the back-side of the sensor.
The MCC communicates with the oﬀ-detector electronics via opto-links, whereas
power is fed into the chips via cables connected to the ﬂex-hybrid [1].

The sensor is subdivided into 41984 “standard” pixels of 50 µm in azimuth
times 400 µm parallel to the LHC beam, and 5284 “long” pixels of 50 × 600 µm to

cover the gaps between adjacent front-end chips. The module has 46080 read-out
channels, which is smaller than the number of pixels because there is a 200 µm gap
in between FE chips on opposite sides of the module. To get full coverage the last
eight pixels in each row are connected to only four channels (“ganged” pixels).

The connection between each pixel and its read-out channel is made through
a bump bond. Two technologies are used, indium bumps and solder bumps. The
minimum bump spacing is 50 µm. No underﬁll material is used between the bumps
to minimise the capacitive coupling between pixels as well as the capacitive load on
the FE inputs. Consequently the bumped assembly is mechanically held together
only by the bumps [2].

The FE chips contain 2880 individual charge sensitive analogue circuits
with a digital read-out that operates at 40 MHz clock. The analogue part consists
of a high-gain, fast preampliﬁer followed by a DC-coupled second stage and a dif-
ferential discriminator. The threshold of the discriminator ranges up to 1 fC, its
nominal value being 0.5 fC. On top of a globally set threshold value the threshold of
each of the 2880 channels can be adjusted individually to allow ﬁne tuning. When
a hit is detected by the discriminator the pixel address and the time at which the
hit occured is provided. Alongside that the time over threshold (ToT) information
allows reconstruction of the charge seen by the preampliﬁer. The pixel address and
timing/charge information is then passed to buﬀers at the bottom of the chip where
data waits for a matching trigger before being sent to the MCC. The MCC does a
ﬁrst event-building of the individual data of the 16 FE chips [3].

2 Module Tests

In order to assure full functionality of the modules in the later experiment, mea-
surements in a test beam and at the production sites are performed.

Beam tests are performed at the SPS at CERN using 180 GeV/c hadrons.
The setup consists of a beam telescope for the position measurement [4], trigger
scintillators for timing measurement to 36 ps, and up to four pixel modules. The
number of defective channels is observed to less than 10−3 and for standard pixels
the eﬃciency for normal incidence particles is 99.57±0.15%. The timewalk, i.e. the
variation in the time when the discriminator input goes above threshold, is an issue
since hits with a low deposited charge have an arrival time later than the ones with
high charges, in particular for ganged pixels. This problem has been addressed in
the latest version of FE chips.

An important test that allows a large range of in-laboratory measurements

is the threshold scan. Signals are created with on-module charge injection and scan-
ning the number of hits versus the so injected charge yields the physical value of the
threshold of the discriminator and the equivalent noise charge as seen by the pream-
pliﬁer. A set of such scans is used to reduce the threshold dispersion by adjusting
a parameter individually for each channel (see above). The resulting threshold and
noise after threshold tuning is shown in ﬁgure 1. Typically approx. 100 e threshold
dispersion across a module and a noise value of below 200 e for standard pixels is
achieved, as is needed for good performance. In a similar fashion, the cross-talk is

measured to a few per cent for standard pixels and a timewalk measurement yields
a result similar to that from the test beam. Data taken when illuminating the sen-
sor with a radioactive source allows in-laboratory detection of defective channels,
again yielding a number similar to that of the test beam. The source-spectrum
reconstructed from the ToT-readings is in agreement with expectations.

In addition, modules are irradiated to a dose approximately corresponding
to 10 years of ATLAS operation The latter results are currently only preliminary
and are thus not reported here although they look promising.

Abstract

The measurement of the close-to-the-carrier noise of two-port radiofre-
quency and microwave devices is a relevant issue in time and frequency
metrology and in some ﬁelds of electronics, physics and optics. While
phase noise is the main concern, amplitude noise is often of interest.
Presently the highest sensitivity is achieved with the interferometric method,
that consists of the ampliﬁcation and synchronous detection of the noise
sidebands after suppressing the carrier by vector subtraction of an equal
signal. A substantial progress in understanding the ﬂicker noise mecha-
nism of the interferometer results in new schemes that improve by 20–30
dB the sensitivity at low Fourier frequencies. These schemes, based on
two or three nested interferometers and vector detection of noise, also
feature closed-loop carrier suppression control, simpliﬁed calibration, and
intrinsically high immunity to mechanical vibrations.

The paper provides the complete theory and detailed design criteria,
and reports on the implementation of a prototype working at the carrier
frequency of 100 MHz. In real-time measurements, a background noise
of −175 to −180 dB dBrad2/Hz has been obtained at f = 1 Hz oﬀ
the carrier; the white noise ﬂoor is limited by the thermal energy kBT0
referred to the carrier power P0 and by the noise ﬁgure of an ampliﬁer.
Exploiting correlation and averaging in similar conditions, the sensitivity
exceeds −185 dBrad2/Hz at f = 1 Hz; the white noise ﬂoor is limited by
thermal uniformity rather than by the absolute temperature. A residual
noise of −203 dBrad2/Hz at f = 250 Hz oﬀ the carrier has been obtained,
while the ultimate noise ﬂoor is still limited by the averaging capability
of the correlator. This is equivalent to a S/N ratio of 2×1020 with a
frequency spacing of 2.5×10−6. All these results have been obtained in
a relatively unclean electromagnetic environment, and without using a
shielded chamber. Implememtation and experiments at that sensitivity
level require skill and tricks, for which a great eﬀort is spent in the paper.

Applications include the measurement of the properties of materials
and the observation of weak ﬂicker-type physical phenomena, out of reach
for other instruments. As an example, we measured the ﬂicker noise of
a by-step attenuator (−171 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz) and of the ferrite
noise of a reactive power divider (−173.7 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz)
without need of correlation. In addition, the real-time measurements can
be exploited for the dynamical noise correction of ultrastable oscillators.

11 More about Stability and Residual Noise

1 Introduction

The output signal of a two-port device under test (DUT) driven by a sinusoidal
signal of frequency ν0 can be represented as

x(t) = V0[1 + α(t)] cos[2πν0t + φ(t)]

(1)

where φ(t) and α(t) are the random phase and the random normalized ampli-
tude ﬂuctuation of the DUT, respectively. Close-to-the-carrier noise is usually

2

described in term of Sφ(f ) and Sα(f ), namely the phase spectrum density (PSD)
of φ(t) and α(t) as a function of the Fourier frequency f . φ(t) and α(t) originate
from both additive and parametric noise contributions, the latter of which is of
great interest because it brings up the signature of some physical phenomena.
True random noise is locally ﬂat (f 0) around ν0. Conversely, parametric noise
contains ﬂicker (f −1) noise and eventually higher slope noise processes as f
approaches zero.

The instrument of the interferometric type, derived from early works [San68,
Lab82], show the highest sensitivity; new applications for them have been re-
ported [ITW98]. Two recent papers provide insight and new design rules for
general and real-time measurements [RGG99] and give the full explanation of
the white noise limit in correlation-and-averaging measurements [RG00a]. The
150 dBrad2/Hz at 1
residual ﬂicker of these instruments turned out to be of
155 dBrad2/Hz correlating
Hz oﬀ the carrier for the real-time version, and
two interferometers.

The scientiﬁc motivations for further progress have not changed in the past
few years. Nonetheless, we whish to stress the importance of close-to-the-carrier
noise for ultrastable oscillators. First, oscillators, inherently, turns phase noise
into frequency noise [Lee66], which makes the phase diverge in the long run.
Then, amplitude noise aﬀects the frequency through the the resonator sensitivity
to power, as it occurs with quartz crystals [GB75] and microwave whispering
gallery mode resonators [CMLB97]. Finally, the knowledge of the instantaneous
value of φ(t) and α(t) in real time enables additional applications, such as the
dynamical noise compensation of a device, for which the statistical knowledge
is insuﬃcient.

This paper is the continuation of two previous ones [RGG99, RG00a] in this
ﬁeld. After them, several elements of progress have been introduced, the main
of which are: 1) the ﬂicker noise mechanism has been understood, 2) the car-
rier suppression adjustment has been split into coarse and ﬁne, 3) elementary
algebra has been introduced to process signals as complex vectors, 4) the car-
rier suppression has been treated as a complex virtual ground. This results in
new design rules and in a completely new scheme that exhibit lower residual
ﬂicker and increased immunity to mechanical vibrations. Calibration is sim-
pliﬁed by moving some issues from radiofrequency hardware to the detector
output. Finally, the carrier suppression is controlled in closed-loop, which is a
relevant point for at least two reasons. Firstly, the interferometer drifts, mak-
ing the continuous operation of the instrument be impossible in the long run.
Then, the residual carrier aﬀects the instrument sensitivity through diﬀerent
mechanisms, and a suﬃcient suppression can only be obtained in closed-loop
conditions.

A digression about the interferometric noise measurement instruments is needed

which includes the major ideas of our previous papers [RGG99, RG00b, RG01,
RG02], plus several unpublished ideas.

The key idea of the interferometric method is that phase noise—as well as
amplitude noise—resides entirely in the sidebands, and that several advantages
arise from removing the carrier signal. Thus, matching the attenuator ℓ and
the phase shifter γ to the device under test (DUT), the carrier is suppressed
at the output ∆ of the right hybrid. The DUT noise sidebands, not aﬀected
by the above equilibrium condition, are ampliﬁed and down converted to base-
band by synchronous detection. Properly setting the phase γ′′, the machine
detects the instantaneous value of φ(t) or α(t), or the desired combination. Ba-
sically, the interferometer is an impedance-matched null bridge; the detector
can be regarded as a part of lock-in ampliﬁer [Mea83] or of a phase-coherent
receiver [LS73, Vit66].

The instruments of the ﬁrst generation [RGG99] make use of continuously
variable attenuators and phase shifters as ℓ and γ; the dotted path, with ℓ′ and
γ′, is absent. A carrier rejection of some 70–80 dB can be obtained, limited by
the resolution and by the stability of ℓ and γ; the adjustment requires patience
and some skill. Experimenting on interferometers at 10 MHz, 100 MHz and
7–10 GHz, the achievable carrier rejection turned out to be of the same order
of magnitude.

The second-generation instruments [RG00a] make use of correlation and av-
eraging to reduce the residual noise. This approach results in outstanding white
noise, not limited by the thermal energy kBT0 referred to the carrier power P0;
kB = 1.38
295 K is the room
temperature.

10−23 J/K is the Boltzmann constant, and T0 ≃

×

The third-generation instruments [RG00b, RG01, RG02] show improved sen-
sitivity at low Fourier frequencies, where ﬂicker is dominant. This feature is
provided by ℓ′ and γ′ and the dashed path.

Improving the low-frequency sensitivity relies upon the following issues,

which updates the previous design rules [RGG99].

Ampliﬁer Noise. The basic phenomenon responsable for the close-to-the-
carrier ﬂicker noise of ampliﬁers is the up conversion of the near-dc ﬂickering of
the bias current, due to carrier-induced nonlinearity. Interesting analyses are
available for bipolar transistors [WFJ97, KB97], yet this phenomenon is general.
In fact, if the carrier power is reduced to zero, the noise spectrum at the output
of the ampliﬁer is of the white type, and no 1/f noise can be present around the
carrier frequency ν0. The assumption is needed that the DUT noise sidebands
be insuﬃcient to push the ampliﬁer out of linearity, which is certainly true with
low noise DUTs.

After Friis [Fri44], it is a common practice to calculate the white noise of a
system by adding up the noise contribution of each stage divided by the gain of
all the preceding ones, for the ﬁrst stage is the major contributor. But ﬂicker
noise behaves quite diﬀerently. Let us consider the design of a low-noise small-
signal ampliﬁer based on oﬀ-the-shelf parts. Almost unavoidably, the scheme
ends up to be a chain of modules based on the same technology, with the same
input and output impedance, and with the same supply voltage. Therefore, the
bias current and the nonlinear coeﬃcients are expected to be of the same order.
Consequently, ﬂicker noise tends to originate from the output stage, where the
carrier is stronger, rather than from the ﬁrst stage.

Interferometer Stability. Common sense suggests that the ﬂicker noise of
the interferometer is due the mechanical instability of the variable elements ℓ
and γ and of their contacts, rather than to the instability of the semirigid cables,
connectors, couplers, etc. By-step attenuators and phase shifters are more stable
than their continuously adjustable counterparts because the surface on which
imperfect contacts ﬂuctuate is nearly equipotential; that contacts ﬂicker is a so
well estabilished fact that Shockley [Sho50] uses the term ‘contact-noise’ for the
1/f noise. Even higher stability is expected from ﬁxed-value devices, provided
the carrier suppression be obtained.

Resolution of the Carrier Suppression Circuit. An amplitude error of
0.05 dB, which is half of the minimum step for oﬀ-the-shelf attenuators, results
in a carrier rejection of 45 dB; accounting for a similar contribution of the
phase shifter, the carrier rejection is of 42 dB in the worst case. This is actually
insuﬃcient to prevent the ampliﬁer from ﬂicker.

Rejection of the Oscillator Noise. The diﬀerence in group delay between
the two arms of the interferometer acts as a discriminator, for it causes a fraction
of the oscillator phase noise to be taken in; the eﬀect of this can be negligible
if the DUT delay is small. Conversely, the rejection of the oscillator amplitude
noise relies upon the carrier rejection at the ampliﬁer input.

Dual Carrier Suppression. A high carrier rejection is obtained with two
nested interferometers. The inner one provides a high stability coarse adjust-
ment of the phase and amplitude condition, while the outer one provides the

5

ﬁne adjustment needed to interpolate between steps. Owing to the small weight
of the interpolating signal, as compared to the main one, higher noise can be
tolerated. An additional advantage of the nested interferometer scheme is the
increased immunity to mechanical vibrations that results from having removed
the continuously adjustable elements from the critical path.

In an even more complex version of the nested interferometer, the ampliﬁer is
split in two stages, and the correction signal is injected in between [RG00b]. The
game consists of the gain-linearity tradeoﬀ, so that the residual carrier due to the
by-step adjustment is insuﬃcient to push the ampliﬁer out of linearity. A resid-
160 dBrad2/Hz has been obtained. Experimenting on
ual ﬂicker Sφ(1 Hz) =
both the conﬁguration similar residual noise has been obtained [RG01, RG02].

Hybrid couplers and power splitters. Basically, a reactive power splitter
is a hybrid coupler internally terminated at one port (when the termination has
not a relevant role, we let it implicit using a simpler symbol). The choice between
Wilkinson power splitters, 180◦ hybrids, and 90◦ hybrids is just a technical
problem. The signal available at the Σ port of the interferometer should not be
used to pump the mixer, unless saving some amount of power is vital; otherwise
the ﬁnite Σ
∆ isolation makes the adjustment of the carrier suppression interact
−
with the calibration of γ′′.

3 The I-Q Controlled Interferometer

Figure 2 shows the scheme of the proposed instrument, and Fig. 3 details the
I-Q modulator-detector. In order to analyze the detection of the DUT noise
we assume that all the components but the mixers are ideal and lossless, and
we also neglect the intrinsic loss of the 20 dB coupler; the corrections will be
introduced later. The mixers show a single side band (SSB) loss ℓm, which
accounts for intrinsic and dissipative losses; this is consistent with most data
sheets of actual components.

Basically, the instrument works as a synchronous receiver that detects the
DUT noise sidebands. Let Nrf be the PSD of the DUT noise around the carrier;
the dimension of Nrf is W/Hz, thus dBm/Hz. By inspection on the scheme, the
noise at the mixer input is gNrf/8ℓm , thus gNrf /4ℓm at each output of the I-Q
detectors; this occurs because the power of the upper and lower sidebands is
added in the detection process. The PSD of the output voltage, either v1 or v2,
is Sv(f ) = gR0Nrf /4ℓm, where R0 is the mixer output impedance. Hence the
dual side band (DSB) gain (or noise gain), which is deﬁned as

as Sv0 is a constant, the phase and amplitude noise ﬂoor become Sφ0 = Sα0 =
2F kBT0/P0.

Finally, the eﬀect of all the dissipative losses in the DUT-mixer path, plus
the insertion loss of the 20 dB coupler CP3 (this accounts for dissipative and
intrinsic losses, as in the data sheet of actual components), is to decrease kssb,
thus kα and kφ. The eﬀect of all the dissipative losses in the DUT-ampliﬁer
path, plus the insertion loss of CP3, is to increase Sφ0 and Sα0, letting Sv0
unaﬀected.

4 Readout

Figure 4 shows the information ﬂow through the instrument. This scheme is
equivalent to that of Fig. 2, but the radiofrequency circuits are hidden, for
all the radiofrequency signals are replaced with their baseband representation
in terms of Fresnel vector. As an example, the noise of (4) takes the form
~n(t) = [n1(t), n2(t)]T , where T stands for transposed.
It is assumed in this

9

Section that the carrier control works properly without interferring with the
DUT noise, hence we account for the DUT noise ~n(t) only, omitting the subscript
dut.

The signal ~v(t) = [v1(t), v2(t)]T at the output of the radiofrequency section
is transformed into the desired signal ~w(t) = [w1(t), w2(t)]T = k [α(t), φ(t)]T
through the transformation ~w(t) = R~v(t), where R = [rij ] is the 2
2 readout
matrix. Equations (7) and (8) turn into the relationship ~v(t) = M~n(t), i.e.

which also accounts for the gain error and asymmetry of the two channels and
for the quadrature error of the I-Q detector. Thus, the matrix R provides the
frame transformation by which

~w(t) = RM ~n(t) .

Of course, the appropriate R is the solution of RM = aI, where I is the identity
matrix and a a constant, so that ~w(t) = a~n(t).

The direct measurement of M relies upon the availability of two reference
vectors that form a base for ~n, the simplest of which is ~v ′ = [1, 0]T and ~v ′′ =
[0, 1]T . This can be done by means of a reference AM-PM modulator at the DUT
output, or by means of a reference I-Q modulator that introduces a reference
signal in the DUT path; unfortunately, both these solutions yield impractical
calibration aspects. Therefore, we split the problem in two tasks, which is
accomplished by letting R = BG; the matrix G = [gij ] makes the detection
axes orthogonal and symmetrical, while B = [bij] rotates the frame.

We ﬁrst ﬁnd G with the well known Gram-Schmidt process [HJ85], replacing
the DUT output signal with a pure sinusoid Vs cos(2πνst). To do so, the DUT,
the variable attenuator and the variable phase shifter are temporarily removed
from the inner interferometer, and all the unused ports are terminated. The
frequency νs is set just above ν0, so that the detected signal be a tone at the
frequency fs = νs
ν0 of a few kHz. The driving signal is equivalent to the

Setting R = I, thus B = I and G = I, we measure the output signals W1
and W2 by means of the dual-channel FFT analyzer; W1 and W2 are the rms
values of the corresponding signals w1(t) and w2(t). The result consists of the

measurement of kssb. Letting Ps the power of the sideband at the DUT output,

where the subscript of W is omitted since now it holds W1 = W2.

In order to complete the task we still have to calculate the rotation matrix B,
for we need a reference to set the origin of angles. After reassembling the inner
interferometer, we insert as the DUT a phase modulator driven by a reference
sinusoid and we measure the output signals W1 and W2; the method works
in the same way with pseudo-random noise, which is preferable because of the
additional diagnostic power. R is temporarily let equal to G, thus B = I; in

5 Automatic Carrier Suppression

The carrier suppression circuit of Fig. 2 works entierly in Cartesian coordinates.
This is obtained by means of an I-Q modulator that controls the amplitude
of two orthogonal phases of a signal added at the ampliﬁer input, which nulls
separately the real and imaginary part of the residual carrier. This method,
which is somewhat similar to the vector voltage-to-current-ratio measurement
scheme used in a low-frequency impedance analyzer [Yok83], can be regarded
as complex virtual ground.

With reference to Fig. 4, the system to be controlled transforms the input

signal ~u(t) = [u1(t), u2(t)]T into ~v(t) = [v1(1), v2(t)]T through

~v(t) = A ~u(t) .

Therefore, the two-dimensional control is split in two independent control loops.
This is a relevant point because interaction could result in additional noise or in
a chaotic behavior. Actually, the quadrature error of the I-Q devices is relatively
small, hence (24) is free from the error enhancement phenomena typical of ill-
conditioned problems.

which is easily measured with the transfer-function capability of the FFT spec-
trum analyzer. Pseudo-random noise is preferable to a simple tone because of
its diagnostic power.

A simple integral ~u(t) =

D ~v(t) dt is suﬃcient to control the carrier
without risk of oscillation or instability. This occurs because there are no fast
variations to track and because, even with simple electronics, the poles of DA
end up to be at frequencies suﬃciently high not to interact with the control.

R

In the normal operating mode, the cutoﬀ frequency f0 = a0/2π of the control
loop must be lower than the lowest Fourier frequency of interest, and a margin
of at least one decade is recommended. An alternate mode is possible [Aud80,
Cg94], in which the control is tight, and the DUT noise is derived from the error
signal. We experimented on the normal mode only.

It should be stressed that the phase and amplitude of the DUT output signal
do not appear—explicitely or implied—in the equations of the control loop. As a
relevant consequence, no change to the control parameters A and a0 is necessary
after the ﬁrst calibration, when the instrument is built.

The automatic carrier suppression of this machine turns into a diﬃcult prob-
lem if not approached correctly, for we give additional references. A fully polar
control based on a phase and amplitude detector and on a phase and amplitude
modulator, similar to that used to extend the dynamic range of spectrum ana-
lyzers by removing a ‘dazzling’ carrier [Hor69], suﬀers from the basic diﬃculty
that the phase becomes undeﬁned as the residual signal approaches zero. The
mixed polar-Cartesian control, based on a phase and amplitude modulator as
the actuator and on a mixer pair as the detector, is simpler than our scheme;
it has been successfully used to stabilize a microwave oscillator [ITW98]. Yet,
the mixed control is incompatible with the nested interferometer scheme be-
cause the residual carrier, made small by the inner interferometer, spans over

12

a wide range of relative amplitude, for the loop gain of the phase channel is
unpredictable and can also change sign. In the ﬁeld of telecommunications, the
polar-loop control was proposed as a means to linearize the power ampliﬁer in
SSB transmitters [PG79], but the advantages of a fully Cartesian-frame control
were soon recognized [Ken00].

Let us analyze the instrument in the presence of thermal noise only, com-
ing from the DUT and from the resistive terminations, under the assumption
that the temperature is homogeneous. As there are several resistive termina-
tions, the complete signal analysis [RG00a] is unnecessarily complicated, thus
we derive the behavior from physical insight. The machine can be modeled
as in Fig. 5. All the oscillator power goes to one termination—or to a set of
terminations—isolated from the rest of the circuit; the ampliﬁer inputs are iso-
lated from one another and from the oscillator. In thermal equilibrium, a power
per unit of bandwidth kBT0 is exchanged between the input of each ampliﬁer

and the instrument core. The two signals ﬂowing into the ampliﬁers must be un-
correlated, otherwise the second principle of thermodynamics would be violated.
Consequently, the thermal noise yields a zero output.

As a consequence of linearity, the non-thermal noise of the DUT is detected,
and the instrument gain (kssb, or kα and kφ), as derived in Section 3 applies.
The instrument measures extra noise (we avoid the term “excess noise” be-
cause it tend to be as a synonymous of ﬂicker, which would be restrictive),
even if it is lower than the thermal energy in the same way as the double
interferometer [RG00a] does. This is the same idea of the Hanbury Brown
radiotelescope [HJD52], of the Allred radiometer [All62, AAC64], and of the
Johnson/Nyquist thermometry [WGA+96]. Obviously, the interferometer ﬂuc-
tuation can not be rejected because there is a single interferometer shared by
the two channels, but it would be if the interferometer was be duplicated.

The trick is that with true random noise, including thermal noise, n1(t) and
n2(t) have identical statistical properties, hence S12(f ) = 0. Conversely, when
a random process modulates a parameter of the DUT, it tends to aﬀect the
phase of the carrier and to let the amplitude unchanged, or to aﬀect the ampli-
tude and to let the phase unchanged. Obviously, this depends on the physical
phenomena involved, the knowledge of which is needed for the instrument to be
useful. This type of detection was originally invented for the measurement of
electromigration in metals at low frequencies [VSHK89], which manifests itself

as a random amplitude modulation, and then extended to the measurement of
phase noise of radiofrequency devices [RG00c].

7 Implementation

We constructed a prototype, shown in Fig. 6 and described underneath, designed
for the carrier frequency νc = 100 MHz.

In search of the highest sensitivity at low frequencies, we decided not to use
commercial hybrids or power splitters in the inner interferometer. In fact these
devices are based on ferrite inductors and transformers, for they could ﬂicker
by modulating the carrier with the magnetic noise of the core; in addition,
they could generate harmonics of the carrier frequency, noxious to the ampliﬁer
linearity. Conversely, the two couplers between the inner interferometer and
the ampliﬁers can be of the ferrite type because they are crossed by a low
residual power, or by the noise sidebands only. Thus we built two Wilkinson
couplers, each with a pair of λ/4 75 Ω PTFE-insulated cables and a 100 Ω metal
resistor. After trimming for best isolation at 100 MHz, the dissipative loss and
the isolation turned out to be of 0.15 dB and 34 dB, respectively.

The phase of the inner interferometer can be adjusted by means of a set
of semirigid cables and SMA transitions. In some experiments we also used a
type of microwave line-stretcher consisting of coaxial pipes with locknuts, whose
internal contacts are well protected against vibrations; the popular and easy-to-

15

use U-shaped line stretcher adjusted by means of a micrometer is to be avoided.
The attenuation can be adjusted with commercial 0.1 dB step attenuators. Two
types were tested, manufactured by Weinschel (mod. 3035) and Texscan (mod.
MA-508), with almost identical results. Measuring the ultimate noise of the
instrument, we used only ﬁxed attenuators and cables, manually trimmed. The
instrument can still be used in this way for actual applications, provided the
attenuator and the phase shifter be matched to the speciﬁc DUT.

The 100 MHz ampliﬁers consists of three cascaded modules in bipolar tech-
nology with low-Q LC ﬁlters in between. The ﬁrst ﬁlter is a capacitive-coupled
double resonator, while the second one is a LCL T-network. The use of two dif-
ferent topologies warrants a reasonable stopband attenuation at any frequency
of interest because the stray pass frequencies do not coincide. For best linearity,
we used for the second and for the third stage a type of ampliﬁer that shows
a third order intercept point of 35 dBm and a 1 dB compression power of 17
dBm, while the total output power never exceeds some
50 dBm. The complete
ampliﬁer shows a gain g = 41 dB and a noise ﬁgure F = 1.5 dB.

−

The I-Q modulator and the I-Q detector are two equal devices built for this
purpose (Fig. 3). The dissipative losses of the power splitter and of the 90◦
hybrid are of 0.5 and 1 dB respectively, while the SSB loss of the mixers is
ℓm = 6 dB. A 10.7 MHz low pass ﬁlter is inserted at the IF port of each mixer
to block the 2ν0 image frequency and the ν0 crosstalk. The quadrature adjust-
ment, present in the earlier releases, is no longer useful because the quadrature
error is compensated by the R and D matrices. The harmonics of the I-Q mod-
ulator must be checked; in our case none of them exceed
65 dBm, which still
insuﬃcient for the ampliﬁer to ﬂicker. I-Qs of similar performances and smaller
size, are available oﬀ-the-shelf at a lower cost. To duplicate the instrument this
is the right choice; we opted for the realization of our own circuit for better
insight, useful in the very ﬁrst experiments. Finally, self interference from the
mixer pump signal to the ampliﬁer can be a serious problem, which caused some
carefully designed layouts not to work properly.

The preampliﬁers at the detector output are a modiﬁed version of the “super
low noise ampliﬁer” [Pmi], consisting of three PNP matched diﬀerential pairs
connected in parallel and followed by a low noise operational ampliﬁer. The
preampliﬁer, that shows a gain of 52 dB, is still not optimized2 for the input
impedance of 50 Ω. Terminating the input to 50 Ω, the overall noise (preampli-
ﬁer and termination) is of 1 nV/√Hz (white), and 1.5 nV/√Hz at 1 Hz (ﬂicker
plus white). The dc oﬀset necessary to compensate for the the asymmetry of
the detector diodes is added at the preampliﬁer output.

The matrices consist of four 10-turns high quality potentiometers, buﬀered

at both input and output, and of two summing ampliﬁers in inverting conﬁgu-
ration. The coeﬃcients, whose sign is set by a switch for best accuracy around
zero, can be set in the

1 range.

The control consists of two separate integrators based on a FET operational
ampliﬁer in inverting conﬁguration with a pure capacitance in the feedback
path; the capacitors can be discharged manually. A dc oﬀset can be added at
the output of each integrator, which is necessary for the manual adjustment of
the outer interferometer to be possible in open loop conditions. The loop time
constant is of 5 s, hence the cutoﬀ frequency is of 32 mHz.

Each circuit module is enclosed in a separate 4 mm thick aluminum box
with 3 mm caps that provide mechanical stability and shielding. The boxes also
ﬁlter the ﬂuctuations of the environmental temperature. Microwave UT-141
semirigid cables (3.5 mm, PTFE-insulated) and SMA connectors are used in
the whole radiofrequency section, while high quality coaxial cables and SMA
connectors are used in the baseband circuits. All the parts of the instrument

are screwed on a standard 0.6
pitch grid, of the type commonly used for optics. The breadboard is rested on
a 500 kg antivibration table that shows a cutoﬀ frequency of 4 Hz. The circuit
is power-supplied by car-type lead-acid batteries with a charger connected in
parallel; in some cases the charger was removed.

×

Finally, we implemented a second prototype for the carrier frequency νc = 5
MHz. This instrument is a close copy of the 100 MHz one, and shares with it the
readout system and the carrier control. Due to the long wavelength (λ/4 = 15
m), the Wilkinson couplers are impractical. Provisionally, we use a pair of 180◦
ferrite hybrids for the inner interferometer.

8 Adjustment and Calibration

For proper operation, the instrument ﬁrst needs to be tuned and calibrated. The
ﬁrst step consists of compensating for the dc oﬀset due to the diode asymmetry
of the I-Q detectors, which is best done disconnecting the interferometer and
terminating the input of the ampliﬁers to a 50 Ω resistor. Secondly, have to set
the readout system, as detailed in Section 4, which also include the measurement
of the SSB gain. Thirdly, the control loop must be adjusted according to the
procedure given in Section 5, and a suitable time constant must be chosen. This
turns out to be easier if the inner interferometer is disconnected and the unused
ports are terminated. Finally, the interferometer must be set for the highest
carrier rejection.

The inner interferometer is ﬁrst inspected alone with a network analyzer;
as the the phase of the transfer function is not used, a spectrum analyzer with
tracking oscillator is also suitable. Even at the ﬁrst attempt, a slight notch, of
at least a fraction of a dB, appears at some unpredictable frequency. Hence, the
interferometer is tuned by iteratively ‘digging’ the notch and moving it to the
desired frequency; ℓ acts on the carrier rejection, while γ acts on the frequency.
The inner interferometer is then restored in the machine and the carrier rejection

17

is reﬁned by adjusting the ﬁne carrier control and inspecting with a spectrum
analyzer on the monitor output of the ampliﬁer. A rejection of some 80–90 dB
should be easily obtained. At this stage the machine is ready to use, and a
carrier rejection of 110–120 dB should be obtained in normal operation.

8.1 Accuracy

Experience suggests that calibration diﬃculty resides almost entirely in the
radiofrequency section, while the uncertainty of the instruments used to measure
the low-frequency detected signals is a minor concern. In addition, the reference
angles are only a second order problem because an error δψ results in relative
2 (δψ)2 in the measurement of φ and α, which is negligible in most
error
cases. The quadrature condition is even simpler because it is based on a null
measurement at the output of the low-frequency section.

−

1

In order to understand calibration, one must remember that 1) α and φ
are voltage ratios, and 2) the instrument circuits are linear over a wide dy-
namic range. As a relevant consequence, the measurement of kα and kφ relies
upon the measurement of a radiofrequency power ratio instead of on absolute
measurements. Actually, the phase-to-voltage gain (as well as the α-to-voltage
gain) is calculated as kφ = √2P0 kssb, which requires the measurement of P0.
But the SSB gain is measured with the sideband method and Equation (18).
Consequently,

kφ =

W .

2P0
Ps

r

(32)

−

−

A diﬃculty arises from the fact that Ps must be a low power,

70 dBm to
80 dBm in our case, while P0 can be higher than 10 dBm. Commercial power
−
meters exhibit accuracy of some 0.1 dB, provided the input power be not less
than some
30 dBm; this is related to the large bandwidth (2–20 GHz) over
which the equivalent input noise in integrated. Therefore, a reference attenuator
is needed to compare P0 to Ps with a wattmeter. Actually, we use a synthesizer
followed by a bandpass ﬁlter and by a 50 dB calibrated attenuator to generate
the sideband, and we measure the sideband power at the ﬁlter output, before the
attenuator; the ﬁlter is necessary to stop the synthesizer spurious signals. In our
case ν0 = 100 MHz is in the frequency range of the two probes (HF-UHF and
microwaves) of the available wattmeter, and we observed that in appropriate
conditions the discrepancy never exceeds 0.05 dB; thus a value of 0.1 dB is
a conservative estimate of the wattmeter uncertainty in the measurement of
P0/Ps. Ascribing an uncertainty of 0.1 dB to the network analyzer with which
the 50 dB attenuator is calibrated, the estimated accuracy of the instrument is
of 0.2 dB.

9 Experimental Results

Our main interest is the sensitivity of the instrument, that is, the background
noise measured in the absence of the DUT. Obviously, a great attention is

18

spent on the low frequency part of the spectrum, where the multiple carrier
suppression method is expected to improve the sensitivity.

In several occasions we have observed that the residual Sα(f ) and Sφ(f ) are
almost equal, as well as the residual noise spectrum of any combination aα + bφ
in which a2 + b2 = 1. Rotating the detection frame with the matrix B, the
variation of the residual ﬂicker can be of 1 dB peak or less. This means that
the residual noise Nrf has no or little preference for any angle versus the carrier.
Hence, after putting right the phase modulator method we did not spend much
eﬀort in calibrating the detection angle. Thus, the detected noise is the scalar
projection of Nrf on two orthogonal axes that in most cases we let arbitrary.
On the other hand, it would be misleading to give the results in terms of Nrf
because the parametric noise is aﬀected by the carrier power, and because the
ratio Nrf /P0 is needed to determine Sφ(f ) and Sα(f ). Therefore, we give the
results in terms of the normalized noise Sn(f ) = Nrf /P0. Of course, Sn(f )
becomes Sφ(f ) or Sα(f ) if B operates the appropriate rotation. The unit of
Sn(f ) is [rad2]/Hz, hence dB[rad2]/Hz, where [rad2] implies that the unit of
angle appears in the appropriate conditions. Anyway, the presence or absence
of the unit rad2 has no eﬀect on numerical values. As in real applications the
measured quantities will be ‘true’ phase and amplitude noise, all the plots are
labeled as Sφ(f ) and Sα(f ), given in dBrad2/Hz and dB/Hz. Yet, in order
to avoid any ambiguity, the radiofrequency spectrum Nrf is also reported (in
dBm/Hz) and it is always speciﬁed whether or not the angle is calibrated.

Finally, the laboratory in which all the experiments are made is not clima-
tized; a shielded chamber is not available, therefore the electromagnetic envi-
ronment is relatively unclean. A 100 Mbit/s computer network is present, while
the electromagnetic ﬁeld of FM broadcastings in the 88–108 MHz band is of
the order of 100 dBµV. Even worse, our equipment is located over the top
of a clean room for Si technology where several dreadful (for us) machines are
operated regularly, like vacuum pumps, an elecron microscope, etching and ion
sputtering systems, etc., and we also share the power-line transformer with the
clean room. No attempt has been made to hide stray signals by post-processing,
consequently all the reported spectra are true hardware results.

9.1 Lowest-Noise Conﬁguration

The ﬁrst set of experiments is intended to assess the ultimate sensitivity of
the instrument. Therefore the inner interferometer is balanced with semirigid
coaxial cables only. In this conditions there results an asymmetry of a fraction
of a degree in phase, and of several hundredth of dB in amplitude, which is
corrected by inserting a parallel capacitance and a parallel resistance in the
appropriate points, determined after some attempts. The actual correction is
so small—some 0.5 pF and a few kΩ in parallel to a 50 Ω line—that the resulting
impedance mismatch has no eﬀect on the noise measurement accuracy. In the
reported experiment the carrier rejection is of 88 dB in ∆′. While the automatic
carrier control is operational, the ﬁne control, no longer needed, is disconnected.
With a DUT power P0 = 14.1 dBm, the gain is √P0kdsb = 80.5 dBV[/rad].

which is 9 dB above the thermal energy kBT0 =

high value is due to the high loss of the DUT-ampliﬁer path, which is of 7.5

insertion loss of CP3. The ampliﬁer contributes with its noise ﬁgure F = 1.5

In a second experiment, the interferometer is removed, and the common
input of the two radiofrequency channels (the input of CP4) is terminated. The
automatic carrier control, still operational, compensates only for leakage. This
experiment is intended to divide the noise of the ampliﬁer and detector from
that of the interferometer. Figure 8 shows the residual noise of the two arms of
the same radiofrequency channel, accurately set in quadrature with one another.
Obviously, only Nrf can be measured because there is no carrier to normalize
to. Anyway, Sφ(f ) and Sα(f ) are also reported for comparison, taking a ﬁctive
carrier power of the same value.

Figure 8: Residual noise of the radiofrequency electronic circuits, measured in

Comparing Fig. 8 to Fig. 7, the noise ﬂoor Nrf 0 is unchanged, which means
that the white noise of the interferometer is negligible. Without interferometer,
Nrf is of
162 dBm/Hz at f = 1 Hz, which is some 1 dB lower than the previous
value. This indicates that most of the ﬂicker of Fig. 7 comes from the ampliﬁer
and detector, and that the interferometer noise is some 6–7 dB lower than that
appears from Fig. 7, say

182 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz.

Back to Fig. 7, the low-frequency correlation between the two channels is of

the stability of the interferometer, shared between the two channels. In fact,
a noise reduction of √2m = 11.3 dB would be expected if the two channels
were independent, while the actual noise reduction is only of some 6.5 dB. In
addition, this conﬁrms the sensitivity inferred in Section 9.1.1, when we removed
the interferometer. Smoothing the plot of Fig. 7, the correlated noise is lower
than kBT0/P0 at a Fourier frequency as low as 3 Hz.

−

As explained in Section 6.1, the white noise ﬂoor, due to the resistive ter-
minations and to the ampliﬁers, is expected to be rejected in the correlation
between the two channels. Figure 9 reports the cross spectrum averaged over
m = 32767 measurements, that is the maximum averaging capability of the
available FFT analyzer. The observed noise reduction is close to the value of
24 dB, that is √2m. Therefore, there is no evidence of correlated noise, and

still referred to an arbitrary detection direction. This simulates the detection
45◦ method. In the same conditions of the previous
of phase noise with the
experiments the gain is of 77.8 dBV[/rad], which is 3 dB lower. This is inherent
45◦ detection scheme. As measurements spanning from 1 Hz take a long
in the
time, the experiment was stopped at m = 635, well before the cross spectrum
could reach its ﬁnal value, for 1/√2m = 15.5 dB. The residual noise is limited
by m for f > 10 Hz, but not in the 1–10 Hz decade. Fitting this decade to the
186 dB[rad2]/Hz at
1/f slope results in a correlated ﬂicker noise is of some
−
f = 1 Hz, which is the lowest value we have ever observed.

9.2 By-Step Attenuator Conﬁguration

In an easier-to-use version of the instrument, we inserted a by-step attenuator
(Weinschel, mod. 3055) and a microwave coaxial phase shifter in each arm of
the inner interferometer, and we restored the ﬁne carrier control. The phase
shifters were set for the best carrier suppression, while one of the attenuator
was set 0.1 dB oﬀ the optimum value, so that the carrier rejection of the inner
interferometer was of 39 dB. This is slightly worse than the “true” worst case,
in which a half-step attenuation error of 0.05 dB and a similar error of the phase
shifter result in a carrier rejection of 42 dB. The residual ﬂicker noise of the
168 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1
instrument, shown in the left part of Fig. 11, is of
Hz.

−

Then, we made two additional experiments. Firstly, we set the attenuators
for the best carrier rejection, and we observed that the ﬂicker noise does not
change. This means that the 0.1 dB error of the attenuator is recovered by the
ﬁne carrier control without adding noise, and that the small signal delivered
by the closed-loop carrier control does not impair low frequency sensitivity.

22

Figure 10: Residual noise, measured in the absence of the DUT, detecting at

45◦ from an arbitrary reference angle.

±

Secondly, we checked upon the phase shifters with the methods of Section 9.1,
and we observed a noise contribution negligible at that level. The relevant
conclusion is that the ﬂicker noise of Fig. 11 is due to the by-step attenuators.
Assuming that the attenuators are equal, each one shows a ﬂicker noise of
171
dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz. As only one attenuator is needed to measure an
actual DUT, this is also the sensitivity of the instrument.

−

9.3 Simpliﬁed Conﬁguration

A simpliﬁed version of the instrument is possible, in which the inner interfer-
ometer can be adjusted by step and the ﬁne carrier control is absent. Of course,
the dynamic range of the closed-loop control must be increased for the control
to be able to recover a half-step error of the inner interferometer. This results
in higher noise from the control and in additional diﬃculty to obtain a slow
response. Actually, this conﬁguration is the ﬁrst one we experimented on.

The prototype makes use of two 180◦ hybrid couplers based on ferrite trans-
formers in the inner interferometer, and has only one radiofrequency channel.
Operating at P0 = 10.9 dBm, the gain is of 80.1 dBV[/rad]. The direction of de-
tection was calibrated carefully, therefore in this case the residual noise consists
of true phase noise and of true amplitude noise. In order to simulate the worst
case, we ﬁrst trimmed the inner interferometer for a relatively deep minimum of
the residual carrier, and then we set the attenuator 0.1 dB oﬀ that point. The
residual noise spectra are shown in Fig. 12. The white noise is Sα0 =
179.6
179.6 dBrad2/Hz. This is equal to the expected value
dB/Hz and Sφ0 =
2F kBT0/P0ℓ, where ℓ = 0.8 dB accounts for the dissipative loss in the DUT-
ampliﬁer path and for the insertion loss of the 20 dB coupler; the noise ﬁgure of
161.5 dB/Hz
the ampliﬁer is F = 1.5 dB. The residual ﬂicker is Sα(1 Hz) =

10 Measurement Examples

The main conclusion of Section 9.2, that the ﬂicker noise of a by-step atteuator
171 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz, is a ﬁrst example of measurement out of
is of
reach for other instruments.

As a second example of application, we measured a pair of 180◦ hybrid
couplers (HH-109 Anzac, now Macom) with the scheme of Fig. 13 (top) inserted
as the inner interferometer. The diﬀerence between the two samples turned out
to be so small that a carrier rejection of 53 dB could be achieved by exploring
the combinatorial permutations of the geometrical conﬁguration. Hence, the
background noise of the instrument was tested by replacing the hybrid pair
with a 53 dB attenuator (Fig. 13 bottom). As the device noise detected on two
orthogonal axes was almost the same, we did not calibrate the detection angle.
Neglecting losses, the power crossing the two hybrids is the same because all
the input power, 17.7 dBm in our case, reaches the 50 Ω termination of the
second hybrid. Although we did not use the correlation feature, we did not
disconnect the unused channel. The result is shown in Fig 14. The noise of
171 dB[rad2]/Hz at f = 1 Hz, while the background noise is of
the pair is of
180.5 dB[rad2]/Hz. After subtracting the latter, the ﬂicker noise of the pair
174.5 dB[rad2]/Hz for each hybrid.

The same HH-109 hybrids, that are designed for the frequency range of 5–200
MHz, were tested at the input power of 14.9 dBm with the 5 MHz instrument.
In this case we used only one radiofrequency channel, and we disconnected the
other one bypassing the coupler in between (CP4); this results in a sensitivity

171.5 dB[rad2]/Hz, and therefore

of the pair is of

Accordingly, the ﬂicker noise of each hybrid is of

The above results conﬁrm the usefulness of the coaxial power dividers to
obtain the highest sensitivity. As the hybrid is a transformer network, there are
good reasons to ascribe the observed ﬂickering to the ferrite core.

the residual noise of previous instruments: plot a is the double balanced mixer
in average-favorable conditions, while plots b and c come from our previous
works [RGG99, RG00a].

The limits of the radiofrequency electronics are taken from Section 9.1.1.
Plot j refers to white noise, while plot f refers to ﬂickering corrected for white.
The correlation limit (plot k) is the white noise lowered by 1/√2m. The noise
of the baseband electronics (plot l) is measured terminating the preampliﬁer
input to 50 Ω, and referring the output noise voltage Sv0 to the DUT. Plots
f, j, k and l (dashed lines) are related to Nrf levels independent of P0, for the
corresponding Sφ(f ) and Sα(f ) decrease as P0 increases. A conventional power
P0 = 14 dBm is assumed.

Noise from the master oscillator (plot i) is measured with a phase modulator
between the oscillator and the power ampliﬁer, scaling the result down according
to the actual oscillator noise. The modulation needed is of some 80–100 dB
higher than the oscillator noise, for this only proves that the oscillator phase
noise is negligible, without providing a precise result. Unfortunately, we have
no information about the amplitude noise of the oscillator.

The “could-be mechanical stability” (plot h) is a reference value inferred
from the residual ﬂicker of
162 dB at f = 10 Hz that we measured measured
at 9.1 GHz on our ﬁrst interferometer [RGG99], under the obvious assumption
that the mechanical ﬂuctuations could not be worse than the overall noise we
measured. We guess that the above result can be scaled down by 39 dB, which
is the ratio (9.1 GHz)/(100 MHz), assuming a similar ﬂuctuation in length. A
phase ﬂuctuation φ(t) is equivalent to a length ﬂuctuation l(t) = (λc/2π)φ(t),

where λc
dBrad2/Hz, taken as a conservative estimate of the interferometer ﬂicker (Sec-
10−20 m2/Hz. In the
tions 9.1.1 and 9.1.2), is equivalent to Sl(1 Hz) = 9.2
case of ﬂicker noise, the appropriate formula to convert the PSD Sy(f ) of the
y(τ ) is σ2
quantity y into the Allan variance σ2
y(τ ) = 2 ln 2 Sy(1 Hz), independent
of the measurement time τ , as well known in the domain of time and frequency
metrology [Rut78]. In our case the Allan deviation, that is the stability of the
interferometer, is σl = 3.6 ˚A. The latter is far from the stability achieved by
other scientiﬁc instruments, like the scanning microscope, for we believe that
there is room for progress.

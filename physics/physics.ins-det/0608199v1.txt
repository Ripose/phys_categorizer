An Integrated Tracker for STAR

Frank Simon (for the STAR collaboration)

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

Abstract. The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider RHIC studies the new
state of matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions and the spin structure of the nucleon in
collisions of polarized protons. In order to improve the capabilities for heavy ﬂavor measurements
and the reconstruction of charged vector bosons an upgrade of the tracking system both in the
central and the forward region is pursued. The integrated system providing high resolution tracking
and secondary vertex reconstruction capabilities will use silicon pixel, strip and GEM technology.

INTRODUCTION AND CURRENT CAPABILITIES

|

The STAR experiment at RHIC studies the fundamental properties of the new state of
strongly interacting matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions and investigates
the spin structure of the proton in polarized p + p collisions. A variety of results both in
heavy ion collisions and polarized p + p collisions have already been obtained. A key fu-
ture step in these programs is the ability for direct reconstruction of particles containing
charm and bottom quarks as well as ﬂavor tagging of jets to allow precise measurements
of the spectra, yields and ﬂow of open charm and bottom and to determine spin depen-
dent production asymmetries connected to the gluon polarization in the nucleon. The
ﬂavor dependence of the sea quark polarization will be determined by parity violating
W production and decay in longitudinally polarized p + p collisions at √s = 500 GeV.
STAR [1] is one of the two large detector systems at RHIC. Its main tracking detector
is a large-volume time projection chamber (TPC) covering the pseudorapidity range

is provided by the silicon vertex tracker (SVT,
detector, and the one–layer silicon strip detector (SSD). Tracking in the forward region is
provided by the forward TPCs (FTPCs, 2.5 <

Additional small acceptance electromagnetic calorimetry at high rapidity is provided by
the forward pion detector (FPD, 3.1 <

The current tracking capabilities are insufﬁcient to address the future measurements
outlined above. The planned integrated tracker is designed to provide the necessary
vertex resolution to uniquely identify open charm and bottom and to provide precision
tracking in the forward region to determine the charge sign of electrons from W + and
W − decays that are detected in the EEMC. Figure 1 shows an overview of the planned
tracking upgrades for STAR. The two distinct areas of inner and forward tracking are
driven by different physics motivations, outlined in the following sections together with
the technology choices for the planned upgrades.

INNER TRACKER

Heavy quarks are good probes for the properties of the matter created in relativistic
heavy ion collisions [2]. Due to their high intrinsic mass, frequent interactions are
needed to bring c and b quarks into equilibrium with the surrounding matter. Collective
ﬂow of heavy quarks is thus a strong indication of thermalization in the early stages
of the reaction. Flavor tagged jets will provide information on the energy loss of light
versus heavy quarks in the created medium. The production of heavy quarks in p + p
c ¯c, b¯b. The double longitudinal
collisions is dominated by gluon-gluon fusion, gg
spin asymmetry in this process thus provides direct access to the gluon polarization in
the proton and is largely independent of the quark helicity distributions [3].

Since ct

120 m m for D0 and ct

460 m m for B0 excellent vertex resolution is
needed to directly identify these particles. The planned upgrade for the STAR inner
tracker is designed to achieve this both in heavy ion collisions and in polarized p + p
collisions by an optimization for high multiplicity and high rate environments. A thin
beryllium beam pipe with a radius of 2 cm will be used to give the detectors close access
to the collision point. The inner tracker consists of three devices, all covering
<
1.0. The Heavy Flavor Tracker HFT [4] is a lightweight two–layer detector based on
30 m m pixels using silicon thinned down to
Active Pixel Sensors (APS) with 30 m m
50 m m, limiting the material of the detector to
0.3% X0 per layer. The inner sensor
layer sits at a radius of 2.5 cm and a staggered outer layer sits at 6.5 cm and 7.5 cm
radius. The radius was increased with respect to the numbers in the original proposal
due to an increased radius of the beam pipe in current plans. This device will provide
a spatial resolution better than 10 m m at the inner layer. A fast intermediate tracker is
needed to act as a pointing device from the TPC to the HFT to connect the precision
points in the HFT to TPC tracks and to provide the time resolution necessary for high

luminosity running. Outside the HFT a single–layer hybrid pixel detector (HPD), using
readout cells of 50 m m
425 m m, is planned at a radius of 9.1 cm. It is based on the
ALICE silicon pixel detector [5], using the same chips and mechanical structure, albeit
with slightly longer ladders to provide for the larger radius. The gap to the existing SSD
at 23 cm will be bridged by the intermediate silicon tracker IST, consisting of two layers
of conventional back-to-back silicon strip sensors at 12 cm and at 17 cm radius. The
1.5 % X0 per layer, similar to
material budget for this fast device is estimated to be
that of the existing SVT. The intermediate tracker will replace the SVT which does not
have sufﬁcient rate capability for future collider luminosities and is incompatible with
future upgrades of the STAR data acquisition system. The precise layout, the number of
layers and the technology choices for the intermediate tracker are currently being studied
in simulations aimed at an optimized design for the inner tracker.

FORWARD TRACKER

From polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments it is known that the ﬂavor-
integrated contribution of quarks to the proton spin is surprisingly small. A measure-
ment of the polarization of the quark sea through a ﬂavor separated study of quark and
anti-quark polarizations is thus of fundamental interest [3]. At RHIC, ﬂavor separated
measurements will be carried out via the maximally parity violating production of
W bosons in u ¯d
W − reactions. These reactions are ideal to access
the quark polarizations since the W boson couples only to left-handed quarks and
right-handed anti-quarks. For W production away from mid-rapidity, the quark is most
likely a valence quark from the proton traveling in the same direction as the produced
W , while the anti-quark comes from the sea of the other proton. That way the spin state
of the proton is cleanly linked to the partons involved in the reaction.

At STAR, produced W s will be detected via their leptonic decays into an electron and
a neutrino, W +
e− ¯n e. The energy of the forward going lepton will
be measured in the EEMC, providing a clean signature for a W decay. It is crucial to
distinguish between W + and W − since this carries the information on the ﬂavor of the
colliding quarks. This is achieved by identifying the charge sign of the high momentum
lepton from the W decay, requiring high resolution tracking in the acceptance of the
EEMC from 1 to 2 in h
, a region currently not covered by trackers in STAR. The
necessary resolution will be provided by two detector systems. The Forward Silicon
Tracker FST will consist of up to 4 silicon disks using conventional back-to-back silicon
strip detectors close to the interaction point. The Forward GEM Tracker FGT will
provide additional space points with a larger lever arm. Two geometries are currently
being evaluated for this device, namely a two layer barrel (each layer providing a space
point) and an option with multiple discs along the beam axis that provide at least two
points on a track for 1 < h < 2. The FGT will be based on GEM technology [6], using
a triple GEM conﬁguration similar to the one successfully applied by the COMPASS
experiment [7]. The front-end electronics for this detector will be based on the APV25-
S1 chip [8], which will also be used for the FST and the IST, signiﬁcantly reducing
development costs for the readout and data acquisition system. For this large-scale
project the commercial availability of GEM foils is necessary. A collaboration with

at CERN (left) and at TechEtch (right). The spectra are ﬁtted with the sum of two Gaussians and a linear
background. The energy resolution (FWHM of the photopeak divided by the mean) is on the order of 20%
for both detectors.

TechEtch Inc. of Plymouth, MA, USA has been established to develop the production
process for these foils. Figure 2 shows typical 55Fe X-ray spectra (main line at 5.9 keV)
recorded with triple GEM test detectors using CERN and TechEtch made foils. The test
detectors are read out via standard preampliﬁer and ampliﬁer setups, collecting the full
charge in a single channel. The energy resolution and signal quality is comparable for
CERN and TechEtch made foils. Some issues with gain stability over time still exist
with the TechEtch foils which are currently being investigated.

SUMMARY

The STAR collaboration is preparing a challenging tracking upgrade program to further
investigate the properties of the new state of strongly interacting matter produced in
relativistic heavy ion collisions and to provide fundamental studies of the nucleon
spin structure in high-energy polarized proton-proton collisions. Key elements are the
ability to directly reconstruct charm and bottom decays and to determine the charge
sign of electrons produced in W decays. The mid-rapidity inner tracker includes high
resolution active silicon pixel sensors, hybrid pixels and standard single sided silicon
strip detectors. The forward tracker is based on silicon strip discs and large area triple-
GEM trackers.

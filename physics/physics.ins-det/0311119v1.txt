Introduction

The BTeV experiment at Fermilab will use an electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCAL) made of
the lead tungstate (PbWO4) crystals [1]. These are scintillating crystals with a rather complex

emission spectrum, consisting of two emission components: blue, peaking at 420 nm and green,
peaking at 480-520 nm. Most of the light, 99%, is emitted in 100 ns. The properties of the
crystals produced by diﬀerent manufacturers as well as the characteristics of the EMCAL
prototype made of these crystals have been investigated using a test-beam facility at the
70-GeV accelerator at Protvino, Russia. Results of the measurements as well as a detailed
description of the test-beam facility are given elsewhere [2], [3], [4].

The light output of the PbWO4 crystals is reduced, as a rule, when they are irradiated using
electron and pion beams. The main reason for this eﬀect is thought to be a lowering of the
crystals transparency in a wavelength dependent manner. To study the magnitude of this
eﬀect we constructed a light output monitoring system that used light emitting diodes (LED)
at four diﬀerent wavelength covering the range from 400 nm to 660 nm. The most important
characteristics of this system include: easy adjustment of the light pulse duration and intensity,
high reliability, low power consumption, durability, and ﬁnally low cost.

The BTeV lead tungstate crystals will be continuously calibrated in situ at the Tevatron using
diﬀerent physical processes. It is envisioned that electrons from B decays as well as photon
conversions will be used for this purpose. The overall system must be able to track the light
output changes in each crystal to an accuracy of 0.2%. The time required to collect enough
events for the energy calibration varies from less than an hour for the most radiated 10% of
the crystals laying close to the beam to about 10-20 hours, for the least hit crystals. A light
monitoring system will track the transparency variation over these time intervals in order to
guarantee that we maintain the calorimeter’s energy resolution.

The monitoring system described here has already proven to be an invaluable tool for our
systematic study of the crystal properties at the test-beam facility. The main goal of the
present study is to measure the levels of instability of this system. This information will allow
us to decide if this type of system can be used in the ﬁnal design of the BTeV monitoring
system.

The stability of the monitoring system was evaluated using data collected from special LED
pulse triggers intermixed with data taken using intense beams that served to irradiate the
PbWO4 crystals. The crystals were exposed to the beam in December 2002 and recovery was
monitored between January and March of 2003.

2 Test-beam Facility

The BTeV calorimeter test-beam setup consisted of a 5×5 array of lead tungstate crystals
coupled to photomultiplier tubes, a beam with a momentum tagging on individual particles
and a trigger system using scintillation counters. To eliminate the eﬀects of temperature vari-
ation, crystals were placed inside a thermally insulated light-tight box. The temperature was
measured continuously at 24 diﬀerent locations around the crystal array using thermo-sensors.
A more detailed description is given in [3]. The main diﬀerence from our earlier test-beam
studies is the use of 6-stage R5380Q Hamamatsu PMT’s (instead of 10-stage R5800 PMT’s)
for the crystals readout. This phototube is one of the possible candidates to be used in the

2

BTeV EMCAL. Signals from the PMT’s were ampliﬁed by a factor of 10 using electronics de-
veloped at Fermilab to match the range of the LeCroy 2285 15-bit integrating ADC modules.
The ampliﬁers were placed near the PMT’s inside the thermo-insulated box. The signal charge
(either from particles or from LED’s) was integrated over a 150 ns gate.

3 Monitoring LED Pulser System Design

The LED-based monitoring system was designed to study variations of the crystals trans-
parency while they were irradiated by high energy particles. Because we used diﬀerent wave-
lengths of light and the crystals transparency change under radiation is wavelength dependent,
it also is possible to monitor changes of the PMT’s gains. These can arise from changes in the
average anode currents, as well as other reasons such as variations in the high voltage (HV)
power supply.

The following LED’s were used in the monitoring system:

• violet (Kingbright L2523UVC), peak wavelength at 400 nm;
• blue (Nichia NSPB 500S), peak wavelength at 470 nm;
• yellow (Kingbright L-53SYC), peak wavelength at 590 nm;
• red (Kingbright L-53SRC-E), dominant wavelength at 640 nm.

Violet and blue LED’s provided the main results about the crystal transparency change in
their respective wavelength regions. The transmission of red light in the PbWO4 crystal is
not aﬀected much by radiation damage [5], and thus we use the red LED to monitor the
photomultiplier gains. This proved to be extremely valuable.

The system consisted of three main parts: a program-controlled LED pulser, a distribution
network comprised of optical ﬁbers and a stability monitoring subsystem. The block diagram
is shown in Fig. 1. All the components of the light monitoring system, except the adjustable
direct current (DC) voltage source, were placed inside the temperature stabilized box near the
crystal array.

The LED pulser includes a shaping ampliﬁer and output transistor (MOS FET) in a switching
mode. The FET source is connected to one of the four LED’s using the LED selector, while
the drain of the FET was connected to the stable DC voltage source. The shaping ampliﬁer
determines the duration (100 ns) of the LED driving pulses. The LEDs’ capacitances made
the duration of light pulses longer, but the signals from all four LED’s were still shorter than
the ADC gate width of 150 ns. The source voltage deﬁnes the light pulse intensity. It can be
set at any value between 0 and +40 V.

The LED pulser’s operation mode was controlled remotely via the data acquisition system
(DAQ) and can be easily modiﬁed if necessary. The selected LED produced a series of 10 light
pulses between two accelerator spills. After the next beam spill, an LED of another wavelength
produced 10 pulses. As a result, four accelerator cycles were necessary to complete the readout
of all four LED’s. The U-70 cycle duration is about 10 seconds. Therefore about 60 amplitude

values per minute (15 for each LED) from each photodetector were recorded during data taking.
This provided enough statistics for accurate monitoring every few minutes.

Clear plastic ﬁber light guides were used to transmit light from the LED’s to the cells of the
EMCAL prototype and to the stability monitoring subsystem. LED’s illuminated a bunch of
optical ﬁbers. They were placed about 100 mm apart to provide a uniform illumination over the
entire ﬁber bundle. Fibers were attached to the far (from PMT’s) ends of the crystals. Typical
pulse height distributions of the signals in one of the EMCAL prototype channels, produced
by four LED’s of diﬀerent wavelengths, collected over 20 minutes are shown in Fig. 2. The
channel 10000 of ADC approximately corresponds to the peak position of the 20 GeV electron
signal amplitude distribution.

To monitor the stability of the LED’s we used two silicon PIN photodiodes HAMAMATSU
S6468-05 and a PMT HAMAMATSU R5800 as a reference photomultiplier tube with a cali-
brated light source mounted on its front window. This light source was comprised of a small
YAP:Ce crystal (3 × 3 × 0.1 mm3) assembled in a plastic case with an α-source [6]. It provided
about 20 ﬂashes per second with maximum of emission spectrum at 360 nm and decay time
of about 30 ns. A signal from the PMT’s last dynode was used for trigger. The DAQ recorded
about 50 α-events between two accelerator spills. An amplitude spectrum obtained from this

signals obtained from one of the PIN photodiodes. The width of this distribution is caused
mainly by the noise of the ampliﬁers rather than photon statistics.

4 Stability Analysis Method

The stability of the monitoring system was estimated using the data from the PIN photodiodes
(PIN1 and PIN2) and the reference PMT (α-PMT). We calculated the mean pulse heights of
signals from the four LED’s measured by PIN1, PIN2 and α-PMT, accumulated over 20-
minutes intervals.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show time variation of α-PMT signals from the yellow LED and the
α-YAP light source over a 30 hour time period. The correlated variations indicate that the
gain of the reference PMT changed during this time. By taking the ratio between 5(a) and
5(b), shown in 5(c), we can correct the LED intensity measured with the reference PMT for the
PMT gain variation. Figure 5(c), in fact, shows much smaller variations. In order to evaluate
the size of the variations, we formed normalized histograms of pulse height measurements
shown in Figures 5(a) and 5(c), which are shown in Figure 6. The r.m.s. of these distributions,
expressed in percent, are 1.04% before the PMT gain corrections and 0.24% afterward. This

correction works very well, therefore all the results on LED’s intensity variations measured
by α-PMT presented in this paper are corrected using the α-YAP light source . The r.m.s. of
the corrected distribution has contributions from the variations of the LED intensity, as well
as the statistical error of each measurement. Measurements made with the PIN photodiodes
reﬂect the LED intensity variation as well as the variation of the PIN photodiode monitoring
system.

5 Monitoring System Performance

We have estimated the stability of the monitoring system for three continuous time intervals
of diﬀerent duration:
a) 25 hours (short-term stability),
b) 200 hours (middle-term stability),
c) 2000 hours (long-term stability).
The results are presented in Table 1.

The Table is organized as follows. There are two groups of results for each of the 25 h and 200
h intervals. The ﬁrst line in each set contains the results obtained while irradiating the lead
tungstate crystals; the second line contains the results while the crystals were recovering. The
2000 h interval reﬂects further recovery; here the data were collected continuously only during
the ﬁrst part (about 550 hours) of this interval. After that, the HV power supply and the DAQ
systems were turned on for only about 10-12 hours a day. We excluded from the analysis data
collected over the ﬁrst 4 hours after each switch-on to allow the system to reach stability.

The results using the α-PMT for the two diﬀerent 25 h sets of data look very similar, but

the recovery-period data appears slightly more stable. This may be explained by the fact that
the system was somewhat aﬀected by electrical noise, which was higher during accelerator
operation. The same diﬀerences are observed in the 200 h results for the violet and blue LED’s
in all three monitoring photodetectors. However, for the yellow and red LED’s (except red in
PIN1) the trend is opposite. The variations over 2000 h do not diﬀer much from those obtained
for 200 h recovery data. Only the violet LED results are worse over 2000 h than 200 h in all
monitoring photodetectors. This is particularly pronounced in the PIN1 data.

The sensitivity of PIN photodiodes is much better in the red region than in the blue one.
Unfortunately signals from the red LED in PIN2 were out of ADC range. To monitor the red
LED by PIN1 we chose a ﬁber with bad light transmission, thus the pulse heights in PIN1
from all other LED’s are signiﬁcantly smaller than those in PIN2. As a result, the relative
statistical errors of mean pulse height calculations and resulting r.m.s. was higher in PIN1.

Detailed study showed that temperature variations aﬀect the monitoring systems stability.
Figure 7(a) shows the temperature variation over ﬁrst 500 hours of the recovery process as
measured by one of the sensors installed in a rather hot place in back of the crystal array
near the PMT’s. The room temperature changed signiﬁcantly during this time interval and
caused non-negligible temperature variation inside the box: the diﬀerence between maximum
and minimum is 0.9◦C. Comparing the variation with time of the mean LED signals (some of
them are shown in Figure 7) and temperature, we ﬁnd that the violet LED signals in both
PIN’s are directly proportional to the temperature, while the blue LED signal in PIN2, the
red LED signal in the α-PMT and the yellow LED signals in all monitoring photodetectors
are inversely proportional to the temperature. No evident dependencies on temperature were
found for the violet and blue signals in the α-PMT, or the blue and red signals in PIN1.

Since we didn’t have temperature sensors installed near the LED pulser, the reference PMT
and PIN’s, dependence of the particular photodetector output signal on its own temperature
cannot be obtained. Nevertheless, it is possible to correct for the eﬀect of the temperature
variations, since all the sensors inside the box gave similar curves of the temperature behavior

depend on temperature. The most probable reason of this eﬀect is that the red LED and PIN1
in the red region have opposite temperature coeﬃcients and compensate each other.

sented in Table 2. The results are given only for those combinations LED – photodetector that

6 Summary

A light monitoring system with four LEDs of diﬀerent wavelengths has been designed for the
BTeV lead tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter prototype and assembled and tested in a
test-beam at Protvino. The system provided an individual check of each prototype channel
by monitoring the PMT’s gain variation and crystals transparency change due to the beam
irradiation.

Each color LED was fed to the crystal-PMT combination using a light ﬁber. In addition,
the LED’s were connected to two PIN photodiodes and a PMT with calibrated light source
placed on its window, to provide reference signals. We have analyzed the stability of the signals
produced by each combination LED – monitoring photodetector for several time intervals of
diﬀerent duration. This analysis allowed us to determine, which photodetector gives the most
stable reference signal for any particular LED. The best combinations were stable within:

• 0.2% over one day;
• 0.4 − 0.7% over one week and longer (up to 3 months).

Variations of temperature were found to be the most important factor which aﬀected the moni-
toring system performance. The correction for temperature was included in the oﬀ-line analysis
in order to estimate the long-term stability of the system in condition of stable temperature.
This correction decreased the r.m.s. instability to 0.2 − 0.4% over several months.

The system completely satisﬁes our demands on stability for the methodical tests of crystals
radiation hardness. It allows us to perform measurements with an accuracy of 0.7% over a few
months. Moreover, the 24-hour system performance has already exceeded the requirements for
BTeV. We are going to design an LED monitoring system for the BTeV EMCAL with the
required long-term stability of 0.2% over a week using the same technical solution in the part
of LED driver. Special care will be put in the choice of LED’s and monitoring photodiodes as
well as the good temperature stabilization of the system.

We thank the IHEP management for providing us infrastructure support and accelerator time.
We thank Sten Hansen for developing and producing the PMT ampliﬁers for our studies. Spe-
cial thanks to Fermilab for providing equipment for data acquisition. This work was partially
supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy as well as
the Russian Foundation for Basic Research grant 02-02-39008.

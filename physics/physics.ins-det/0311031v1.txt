Introduction

The method of computation of currents induced on electrodes by charges mov-
ing in vacuum was introduced in [1], [2]. In presented paper, this method is
generalised for charges moving in a media.

Derivation of the Induced Current

Consider the moving charge, qm, inside a semiconductor and any number of
conductors at constant potentials for one of which, say A (following Ramo’s
approach [2]), the induced current is desired. The potential of the electrostatic
ﬁeld inside the semiconductor under static or low frequency conditions [3]
satisﬁes

εε0∇2V = −ρ,

where ρ is a charge density, ε0 is permittivity of free space and ε is permittivity
of the media.

The boundaries are surfaces of electrodes and tiny equipotential sphere sur-
rounding moving charge. The integral over a boundary surface Si equals to

where n is the outward normal to the surface and Qi is the charge on the i-th
electrode or moving charge.

Also consider the same geometry of conductors in the free space but without
moving charge. Potential of the electrode A is rised to unit potential and all
other conductors are grounded. Potential in this case, V ′, satisﬁes ∇2V ′ = 0
everywhere between conductors.

Applying Green’s theorem to the vector function

f = εε0(V ′ · ∇V − V · ∇V ′),

we obtain the following equation

εε0(V ′ · ∇2V − V · ∇2V ′)dv = −

Using, that by design, V ′ = 0 on the surfaces of all electrodes but A and
∇2V ′ = 0 in the space between boundaries Eq. 4 can be rewritten as

where the integration is over the volume of the media. In the case when me-
dia is vacuum or isolator, the second term is zero and Eq. 9 became Ramo-
Shockley’s equation. In the case of semiconductor, this term is a weighted sum
of currents generated by moving charge inside the semiconductor.

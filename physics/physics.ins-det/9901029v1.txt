Abstract

We describe the ﬁrst tests with a new proportional gas detector. Its ge-
ometry consists in slits opened in a copper metallized kapton foil with 30
µm anode strips suspended in these openings. In this way the multiplica-
tion process is similar to a standard MSGC. The fundamental diﬀerence is
the absence of an insulating substrate around the anode. Also the material
budget is signiﬁcantly reduced, and the problems related to charging-up or
polarization are removed. Ageing properties of this detector are under study.

1 Introduction

A new generation of high rate proportional gaseous detectors based on ad-
vanced printed circuit technology (PCB) has been introduced during the last
year.
Important eﬀorts in the research and development of these kind of
detectors are justiﬁed because of their low cost and robustness. Examples of
these detectors are the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [1], the Micro-Groove
Detector (MGD) [2], and the WELL detector [3]. They have in common the
use of thin kapton foils and PCB techniques in order to implement the multi-
plication structure. The ﬂexibility of the readout is precisely another advan-
tage of these detectors, allowing in some cases an intrinsic two dimensional
device. Detector charging up and operation stability are important issues
that need to be studied. We present here indications of a good performance
for the Micro Slit Gas Detector (MSGD).

2 Detector description

The development of kapton etching techniques (commonly used for GEM
production) has made possible the easy construction of new detector geome-
tries.

In this case one of the metallic layers, of a 50 µm thick kapton foil copper
clad on both sides, is litographically etched with a matrix of rectangular
round-corner slits, 105 µm wide and 6 mm long (repeated in the transverse
direction with a period of 200 µm). In the opposite side, a pattern 30 µm
wide strips with 200 µm pitch is etched, ensuring that the strips run along
the slits (see Figure 1).

When kapton is removed, the ﬁnal device has 30 µm strips suspended only
by 200 µm kapton joints regularly spaced at 8 mm (to provide mechanical
stiﬀness) (Figure 2). In this way a “substrate-free” MSGC is achieved, and
the detector resembles a wire-chamber.

The ﬁrst detector prototype, 10×10 cm2, was enclosed in a gas volume,
which was sealed symmetrically by two thin conductive foils, at 3 mm dis-
tance from the kapton plane (see Figure 3). The ﬁrst provides the drift ﬁeld
towards the multiplication region (drift plane), and the second was given, in
the test, a certain potencial with respect to the anodes, which we discuss
later. Initially this backplane was metallized with the aim to deﬁne better

2

the electric ﬁeld around the anode.

3 Detector performance

The signal development takes place in a similar way as in a standard MSGC.
Drifting electrons reach the E-ﬁeld region between anode and cathode, and
are then multiplied inside the rectangular slits. The electron avalanche pro-
duced in this region is collected by the anode strips. The ion charge is
collected by the cathode and the drifting plane, in a proportion depending
on the operating voltages. In this case anodes were grounded through a bias
resistor while a negative potential was applied to the cathode.

The detector was irradiated with X rays coming from an Cr X-ray tube
and the gas mixture used was composed by Ar and DME in diﬀerent pro-
portions.

The signal was extracted from an OR of 32 anodes and ampliﬁed by a
ORTEC 142PC preampliﬁer followed by an AFT Research Ampliﬁer Model
2025. The output was digitized in a Tektronix TDS 684A Oscilloscope.

3.1 Operation voltages

Typical operating voltages in the ﬁrst prototype are very similar to MSGCs.
Detector gains obtained are somewhat lower3 . This is understandable due to
the width of the anode strips (still limited by the PCB production technique),
and also as a consequence of the extended gap between anode and cathode
because of the non planar geometry and the cathode width 4. The detector
gain exhibits an exponential dependence on the voltage applied to the cath-
ode (Figure 4). In this Figure the maximum gains showed were limited by
sparks in the chamber. In some tests afterwards the MSGD was exposed to
severe sparking during hours but no damage in its structure was found.

A pulse height spectrum can be seen in Figure 5. The voltage applied to
the backplane does not aﬀect essentially the anode signal, as illustrated also
in Figure 5.

3In a typical MSGC with 10 µm anodes and 100 µm cathodes with Ar-DME 50% a
gain of aprox. 1000 is achieved with a cathode potential of 550, while in the Micro Slit
detector gain is around 600.

4New prototypes are under development with wider cathodes

3

Figure 6 shows spectra obtained with diﬀerent values of the cathode vol-
tage. Decreasing it by 10 V, for the drift voltage Vd=-1600 V, produces a
20% drop in the gain.

In these spectra, the Argon scape peak is clearly separated from that
corresponding to the Kα photon energy at 5.4 KeV. The energy resolution
for pulse height spectra measured with Vd=-1500 V and Vcat=-515 V is 16%
FWHM, and in this ﬁeld conﬁguration 90% of the ions drift to the cathode
electrode.

The dependence of the gain with the cathode voltage was also studied for
diﬀerent gas mixtures. The results of these studies (Figure 4) show that the
highest gains were obtained with high argon content in the gas mixture.

Also the dependence on gain with the drift ﬁeld is showed in Figure 7.

Clearly an enhancement of gain is obtained with higher drift ﬁeld values.

3.2 Short term gain variation

Typically variations on the gain during the ﬁrst operation moments manifest
in those detectors using insulating substrates. This is due to the accumu-
lation of charge on the dielectric (charging-up) and polarization, produc-
ing electric ﬁeld modiﬁcations, and thus aﬀecting the ampliﬁcation process.
Normally this eﬀect has been avoided using higher conductive coatings (like
LPVD diamond) [4] or substrates (like S8900). In the GEM, for example,
kapton surface of the holes is clearly traversed by the dipole electric ﬁeld
thus producing some charging up 5. In this geometry we have designed the
electrodes in such a way that exposed area to E-ﬁeld represents only around
1% of the total. This (see below) represents a major improvement in this
type of devices just simplifying the production (no coating needed).

The eﬀect of charging up on the MSGD gain was determined by registe-
ring the pulse height spectrum and comparing the maxima from consecutive
periods. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the gain during the ﬁrst 82 minutes
of irradiation under a rate of 103 Hz mm2 beginning from a cold start (de-
tector and beam initially switched oﬀ). Variations of the gain are less than
a 4%.

In order to accelerate the eﬀect of this possible charge accumulation, the
5 A small admixture of water in the gas as well as straighter holes have demonstrated

to solve the problem.

MSGD was irradiated with a photon rate of ≈ 106 during about 10 minutes.
Figure 9 compares the spectra before and after the high irradiation. No
appreciable change occurs. This behaviour diﬀers from that observed in
detectors with dielectric substrate, like standard MSGC or GEM.

4 Rate capability

The rate capability of this detector was determined by measuring the current
in the group of instrumented anodes for diﬀerent values of the incident photon
ﬂux. Driving the X-ray tube to its maximum current, we could reach up
to 2.6 ×106 Hz mm−2 incident photon ﬂux, collimated over a surface of 3
mm2. No appreciable drop in gain was observed. In Figure 10 the relative
changes in the detector gain during the irradiation test are shown. They were
determined from the observed deviations with respect to a linear ﬁt between
X-ray intensity and anode current.

The advantage of the MSGD is the eﬀective absence of any dielectric
surface, avoiding the use of delicate high resistive coatings to reach values of
106 mm−2 s−1.

5 Conclusions

A prototype of a new proportional gas detector, based on the PCB technol-
ogy, has been designed and tested.

The ﬁrst tests with this detector show important properties, related
mainly to its high rate capability (up to 2.5 MHz mm−2) and the absence of
charging up eﬀects.

In spite of its similarity to the MSGC in the ampliﬁcation process the
use of the PCB technology reduces considerably the cost and material bud-
get. Besides, it is important to remark the supression of the substrate for
supporting the anode structure.

Another interesting possibility is to set up a similar detector with a mir-
ror cathode structure respect to the anode plane, thus having upper and
lower drift regions and allowing to reduce the eﬀective drift gap and charge
collection time.

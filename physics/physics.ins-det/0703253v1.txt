Abstract

The paper reviews recent progress in particle identiﬁcation methods. A survey of
motivations and requirements for particle identiﬁcation in various experimental en-
vironments is followed by the main emphasis, which is on the recent development
of ˇCerenkov counters, from upgrades of existing devices to a novel focusing radiator
concept and new photon detectors. The impact of including a precise measure-
ment of the time of arrival of ˇCerenkov photons to increase the kinematical region
over which particle identiﬁcation can be performed is discussed. The progress in
dedicated time-of-ﬂight counters with recently developed very fast single photon
detectors is also evaluated.

1 Introduction

One of the main driving forces of the research and development of particle iden-
tiﬁcation methods in the last decade was the need to have excellent hadron
identiﬁcation for precision B physics measurements. For a statistically signif-
icant measurement of CP violation in the B system, the tagging of B meson
ﬂavour with the kaon charge was an indispensable method. In addition, for
the study of rare few body hadronic decays of B mesons it is essential to sep-
arate pions from kaons up to the kinematic limits of the experiment. Reliable
hadron identiﬁcation is also important in the search for quark-gluon plasma
and in studies of the nucleon structure.

Hadrons are identiﬁed by their mass, which is, in turn, determined by combin-
ing the measurements of momentum and velocity. Assuming that momentum
is inferred from the measured radius of curvature in magnetic ﬁeld, the re-
maining issue is to measure the velocity with a suﬃcient precision. This is
either achieved by measuring the time-of-ﬂight, ionization losses or ˇCerenkov
angle of the particle. In the present contribution recent progress in ˇCerenkov
counters and time-of-ﬂight measurements is discussed.

The structure of the paper is as follows. We ﬁrst review the ˇCerenkov counters
in some of the running or recently completed experiments. A number of new
methods is presented, from upgrades of existing devices to a novel focusing
radiator concept and new photon detectors. We then discuss the beneﬁts of
including a precise measurement of the time of arrival of ˇCerenkov photons
in order to reduce the dispersion error and the even more ambitious use in
a combined time-of-ﬂight (TOF) and time-of-propagation (TOP) counter. Fi-
nally, we will discuss the progress in dedicated TOF counters with recently
developed very fast photon detectors.

ˇCerenkov counters

2.1 DIRC at BaBar

The DIRC (Detector of Internally Reﬂected Cherenkov light) of the BaBar
spectrometer is a special type of a ring-imaging ˇCerenkov counter (1), based on
the detection of ˇCerenkov photons trapped in the quartz radiator bar (Fig. 1).
The patterns on the photon detector are quite complicated, but result in
well resolved peaks in the ˇCerenkov angle distribution. The time of arrival
of photons is used to eliminate background from conversion events in the
water tank, to assign photons to proper tracks, and to eliminate most of the
ambiguities in the photon-track reconstruction.

The basic performance parameters of the counter are in excellent agreement
with expectations (1). The single photon resolution amounts to 9.6 mrad. The
number of photons depends on the polar angle of the charged track, but always
stays above 20 for β = 1 particles. The eﬃciency for kaon identiﬁcation exceeds
90% in the momentum range 0.5 GeV/c - 3 GeV/c, while the probability that
a pion is identiﬁed as a kaon stays at a few percent level (Fig. 2).

2.2 ACC at Belle

In the Belle spectrometer the separation of kaons from pions is performed with
the Aerogel Cherenkov Counter (ACC), a threshold ˇCerenkov detector (Fig. 3)
with aerogel as radiator (2). The refractive index of the radiator is chosen so
that pions emit ˇCerenkov light, while kaons stay below threshold. Since the
momentum spectrum of particles becomes harder in the forward direction,
the refractive index of the modules gradually decreases from n = 1.028 to
n = 1.01. Note that while in the central (barrel) part it is possible to measure
both the tagging kaons and the B
ππ, Kπ decay products, only the former
can be identiﬁed in the forward (end-cap) direction. The kaon identiﬁcation
eﬃciency amounts to 90% with the pion fake probability equal to 6% (3).

2.3 HERA-B RICH

The HERA-B collaboration was the ﬁrst to employ multianode photomulti-
plier tubes in a RICH counter (Fig. 4) (4), after having shown that the Hama-
matsu R5900 PMTs (versions M16 and M4 with 16 and 4 square shaped
channels, respectively) have a capability to detect single photons with high
eﬃciency, and little cross-talk (5). The photon detector performed very well,
showing clear rings with very few noisy channels (< 0.5%) even in a very
hostile environment of a hadron machine, as can be seen from Fig. 5.

A common drawback of vacuum based photon detectors is a rather large frac-
tion of dead area. While for single channel PMTs reﬂective cones can be used,
multichannel PMTs need an imaging system. In the HERA-B RICH a system

of two lenses, shown in Fig. 6, was used to demagnify the image on the focal
surface by a factor of 2 (6). The system of lenses is used both to reduce the
dead area, as well as to adapt the required granularity of the photon detector
to the granularity of the multianode PMT. The transparency of the system
is high in the region of high quantum eﬃciency of the tube. It also has a ﬂat
acceptance for photons with incidence angles below 140 mrad as required by
the detector geometry.

The experience of the HERA-B collaboration shows that a RICH counter can
safely be operated even at high track densities with counting rates exceeding
1 MHz per channel in the hottest part of the photon detector (4). A typical
event is shown in the lower plot of Fig. 5. No degradation of performance has
been observed over the ﬁve years of operation. The relevant RICH parameters
were determined from the data. On average 32 photons were detected per
β = 1 ring. The single photon resolution was 0.7 mrad in the ﬁner granularity
area covered by R5900-M16 PMTs. All parameters are in very good agreement
with expectations. The particle identiﬁcation capabilities are illustrated in
Fig. 7.

2.4 COMPASS, Hades and ALICE RICH counters

The RICH counters of COMPASS (7), Hades (8) and ALICE(9) experiments
employ multiwire chambers with a solid CsI layer, evaporated onto the cathode
pads, as the photon detector. The material requires a high purity chamber gas,
usually methane with water and oxygen content of order ppm, as well as careful

handling of the photo-cathodes. A lot of R&D (inﬂuence of substrate, thermal
conditioning, thickness, evaporation procedure, transfer to the chamber) was
needed to make the technique mature (10; 11). A special evaporation plant
with a sophisticated conditioning facilities and quality assessment controls
was constructed at CERN for this purpose. While Compass and Hades RICH
counters have been running stably for several years, the ALICE RICH is under
construction (12).

In the Compass experiment the central region of the RICH counter was re-
cently upgraded to enable running at higher beam intensities, higher trigger
rates and with a nanosecond time resolution for background suppression (13).
The wire chamber based photon detector was replaced by an array of multi-
anode PMTs very similar to the HERA-B RICH (Sec. 2.3). The PMTs, again
Hamamatsu 16 channel tubes, have quartz windows, and the 7:1 demagniﬁca-
tion two-lens light collection system is made of quartz lenses. This results in
60 per ring for β = 1 particles). The
a larger number of detected photons (
measured ˇCerenkov angle resolution per track is
0.3 mrad, allowing a 2σ
π/K separation at 60 GeV/c. The kaon identiﬁcation eﬃciency exceeds 90%

2.5 LHCb RICH

In the next generation of B physics experiments at hadron colliders the iden-
tiﬁcation of hadrons will again be essential for both the tagging of b-ﬂavour
in CP violation and for mixing measurements, as well as for the identiﬁcation
π+π−. In particular this is
of particles in hadronic ﬁnal states such as B
so because more channels contribute to the background than in the case of
K +K −). In the LHCb experiment the RICH

(14). The kinematic region covered by a RICH counter, from pmin to pmax,
depends on the threshold momentum for the lighter of the two particles one
wants to separate, and on the resolution in ˇCerenkov angle (ultimately given
by the dispersion in the radiator medium). It turns out that for most radi-
ators pmax/pmin

experiment one would therefore require three radiators. They are arranged in
two counters (14) as shown in Fig. 8.

Several photon detectors were considered as candidates for the system of RICH
counters; a photon detector based on multianode PMTs with a single quartz
lens light collection system (16), as well as two types of hybrid photon detectors
(HPD). In the latter, a vacuum photosensitive device is combined with charged
particle detection in a silicon detector with pixel readout (17). As shown in
Fig. 9, photoelectrons are accelerated by the electric ﬁeld across a potential
diﬀerence of about 20 kV towards a silicon detector with integrated electronics.
The results of beam tests of the ﬁnal module, developed in collaboration with
the DEP company, are very encouraging (18).

3 Recent developments in RICH counters

For the next round of B physics experiments at upgraded e+e− machines
(’Super B factories’) with luminosities exceeding 1035 cm−2s−1, considerable
improvements of particle identiﬁcation devices are envisaged in order to cope
with higher rates and with more stringent requirements on separation capa-
bilities for rare decay channels.

3.1 Upgrades at Belle

Two systems are being considered for the upgrade of the Belle spectrometer
(19). For the barrel region a time-of-propagation (TOP) counter is being stud-
ied. This is a kind of DIRC counter in which the ˇCerenkov angle is deduced
by measuring one of the coordinates and the time of arrival of ˇCerenkov pho-
tons with high precision (20). Multianode micro-channel plate (MCP) PMTs,
including a detector with a GaAsP photocathode, are being investigated (21).

For the end-cap region, a proximity focusing RICH with aerogel as radiator is
being tested (Fig. 10). The counter should have a low threshold for pions, and
should enable good separation of pions and kaons up to 4 GeV/c. Another
beneﬁt of such a counter would also be a reasonable e/µ/π separation at low
momenta, which is of importance for the studies of rare B

Kℓℓ decays.

→

The feasibility of such a counter was studied in a series of beam tests (22; 23).
Hamamatsu H8500 (’ﬂat panel’) PMTs were used as photon detectors (24).

As can be seen from Fig. 10, the ˇCerenkov peak is well pronounced above a
small background, mainly coming from ˇCerenkov photons which were Rayleigh
scattered in the radiator. The resolution in the ˇCerenkov angle measurement
(σθ = 14 mrad) and the number of detected photons (N
6, Fig. 10) agree
well with expectations. The resulting resolution per track is about 5.7 mrad.
Since the diﬀerence in ˇCerenkov angle of pions and kaons is 22 mrad at
4 GeV/c, such a counter would allow a good (about 4σ) separation up to
the kinematic limit of the experiment.

schematic (a), measured single photon resolution (b) and the number of detected
photons (c) for a 2 cm thick aerogel tile.

The key issue in the performance of a proximity focusing RICH counter is to
improve the ˇCerenkov angle resolution per track σtrack = σθ/√N . As it turns
out, the optimal thickness is expected to be around 20 mm (22; 25). However,
this limitation can be overcome in a proximity focusing RICH with a non-
homogeneous radiator (25; 26; 27; 28). By judiciously choosing the refractive
indices of consecutive aerogel radiator layers, one may achieve overlapping
of the corresponding ˇCerenkov rings on the photon detector (Fig. 11) (28).
This represents a sort of focusing of the photons within the radiator, and
eliminates or at least considerably reduces the spread due to emission point
uncertainty. Note that such a tuning of refractive indices for individual layers is
only possible with aerogel, which may be produced with any desired refractive
index in the range 1.01-1.07 (29). The dual radiator combination can readily
be extended to more than two aerogel radiators. In this case, the indices of
aerogel layers should gradually increase from the upstream to the downstream
layer.

In Fig. 12, we compare the data for two 4 cm thick radiators; one with aerogel
tiles of equal refractive index (n = 1.046), the other with the focusing ar-
rangement (n1 = 1.046, n2 = 1.056). The improvement is clearly visible. The
single photon resolution σθ = 14.3 mrad for the dual radiator is considerably
smaller than the corresponding value for the single refractive index radiator
(σθ = 20.7 mrad), while the number of detected photons is the same in both
cases.

The present R&D eﬀorts are oriented mainly toward the development of a
photon detector which works in the high magnetic ﬁeld (1.5 T) of the Belle
spectrometer. The Burle 85011 MCP PMT (30), a multichannel device with
8x8 channels and 6 mm
6 mm large pads, has been shown to perform very
well as a detector of ˇCerenkov photons in a RICH counter (31).

Two further detectors are being studied. In a joint eﬀort with the Hamamatsu
company a new type of hybrid photon detector of the proximity focusing type
is being developed. As the second option, silicon photomultipliers, novel semi-
conductor photon detectors are being tested (32; 33; 34). They have several
advantages: insensitivity to the high magnetic ﬁelds, lower operation voltage,
and less material in comparison to the conventional photomultiplier tubes.
They also have high peak photon detection eﬃciency (approx 20%), high gain
106 and good time response. Due to their dimensions, they allow compact,
of
light and robust mechanical designs. All this would make them a very promis-
ing candidate for a detector of ˇCerenkov photons in a RICH counter. However,

have up to now never been used in ring imaging ˇCerenkov detectors, where
single photon detection is required at low noise. Because the ˇCerenkov light
is prompt, this problem could in principle be reduced by using a narrow time
window (< 10 ns) for signal collection. In addition, it is possible to further
increase the signal-to-noise ratio by using light collection systems (35).

3.2 Focusing DIRC

As an upgrade of the DIRC counter, a layout with a considerably smaller
stand-oﬀ box is being considered (36) as shown in Fig. 1. Such a change
would signiﬁcantly reduce the beam related background. However, in order
not to degrade the angular resolution, single channel PMTs would have to be
replaced by multichannel devices among which the Hamamatsu ﬂat panel 64
channel PMTs and the Burle 64 channel micro-channel plate (MCP) PMTs
have been studied. Two further changes are considered which should consid-
erably improve the angular resolution. The uncertainty in the emission point
along the track will be eliminated by focusing optics of the expansion volume
made of quartz. The chromatic error will be reduced by measuring the time
of arrival of ˇCerenkov photons with a resolution of 50-100 ps, from which the
wavelength of each photon can be estimated. The expected resulting total an-
gular error is 4-5mrad per single photon, which makes it possible to achieve an
angular resolution of 1.5 mrad per track in principle. While the present BaBar
DIRC achieves a 2.7σ π/K separation at 4 GeV/c, the equivalent performance
of the upgraded DIRC would be 4.3σ at 4 GeV/c for photons traveling a full
bar length of 3-4 m.

To demonstrate the capability of eliminating the chromatic error contribution,
tests of candidate photon detectors were carried out to evaluate their timing
resolution and homogeneity of response (37). By using a pulsed laser diode
and dedicated read-out electronics, the time resolution of the MCP PMTs was
measured. An excellent time resolution of 30 ps was achieved (38; 39). The
performance of a focusing DIRC prototype was successfully tested in a test
beam (39).

4 Recent progress in time-of-ﬂight counters

A proximity focusing RICH counter such as the one discussed in section 3.1
is also a very fast counter, in particular if a micro-channel plate (MCP) PMT
is used as the photon detector. With its excellent timing properties, the same
device could also serve as a time-of-ﬂight counter and thus supplement other

identiﬁcation methods, in particular for low momentum tracks. ˇCerenkov pho-
tons emitted in the radiator medium as well as in the entrance window of the
PMT can be used for the time-of-ﬂight measurement (Fig. 13). This allows
a positive identiﬁcation also of particles that would be below the ˇCerenkov
threshold in the aerogel radiator (kaons and protons in the region around
1 GeV). Consequently, a good separation of kaons and protons would be pos-
sible in this region as well.

To test this idea, in a beam test both the hit position and its time were regis-
tered with a Burle 85011 MCP PMT (40). The distributions of hits, depending
on their time of ﬂight for ˇCerenkov photons from the aerogel, is plotted in
Fig. 14. Fitting this distribution with a Gaussian function yields a standard
deviation of about 50 ps. For 10 detected hits per track this would correspond
to a time-of-ﬂight resolution of 20 ps.

An excellent resolution is also found in the time-of-ﬂight distribution as deter-
mined by ˇCerenkov photons from the PMT window. As can be seen in Fig. 14,
the standard deviation of the distribution for pions is 37 ps. We can also see

that pions are clearly separated from protons even in this very compact set-
up with a very short ﬂight path of 65 cm. In the Belle spectrometer, where
the typical ﬂight path is about 2 m, the measured performance would corre-
spond to a 6 σ separation between pions and kaons at 2 GeV/c, and a 3.5 σ
separation between protons and kaons at 4 GeV/c.

To further improve the time resolution, one could increase the number of
photons to about 50 by adding an additional 1 cm thick quartz radiator in
front of the PMT. This idea was tested in a set-up with a somewhat faster
version (Burle 85001-501 P01) of the same MCP PMT with 10 µm pores
(instead of 25 µm), and with a pulsed laser as a source of photons (39). In
Fig. 15 the improvement in resolution is clearly observed. By using an even
thicker radiator (up to 5 cm), a time resolution of 6 ps was observed (41).
With such a resolution the time-of-ﬂight counter becomes quite competitive
with a RICH counter in the kinematical region up to 4 GeV/c.

5 Summary

in particular the ˇCerenkov counters of the
Particle identiﬁcation devices,
BaBar and Belle spectrometers have contributed signiﬁcantly to the rich B
physics harvest of the last seven years. Identiﬁcation of particles in the ﬁnal
state with ˇCerenkov counters has also contributed to the present understand-
ing of nucleon structure and of the production of heavy quarks in nucleon-
nucleon collisions. Upgrades are planned to further improve their performance
and to allow them to work at even higher event and background rates. New
techniques, including a novel focusing radiator concept and new fast pho-
ton detectors, have been successfully studied. By using the time of arrival
of ˇCerenkov photons, the dispersion error could be reduced. Furthermore, a

14

RICH counter equipped with fast photon detectors can be combined with a
time-of-ﬂight or a time-of-propagation counter. Finally, a new type of TOF
counter was studied with the same very fast photon detectors. It is expected
that these particle identiﬁcation methods will again play a decisive role in the
next generation of precision experiments in B physics.

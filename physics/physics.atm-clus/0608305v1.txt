Abstract

A simple mass spectrometric method has been developed to quantify dopant levels in
heteronuclear clusters in the gas phase. The method is demonstrated with reference
to quantiﬁcation of the water content in supersonic beams of water-doped argon
clusters. Such doped clusters have assumed much importance in the context of
recently-reported doping-induced enhancement in the emission of energetic charged
particles and photons upon their interaction with intense laser pulses. We have also
measured the energy that a doped cluster absorbs from the optical ﬁeld; we ﬁnd
that energy absorption increases with increasing level of doping. The oft-used linear
model of energy absorption is found to be quantitatively inadequate.

with intense laser ﬁelds [1,2,3]. In recent experiments, irradiation by short,
intense, infrared (800 nm wavelength) laser pulses with large van der Waals
clusters comprising a few thousand to several hundred thousand atoms has
been extensively investigated. One of the motivations for such studies has been
the unusually eﬃcient manner in which large, gas-phase clusters absorb energy
from the optical ﬁeld that they are irradiated by. Energy absorption in excess
of 90% has been reported for rare-gas clusters exposed to laser intensity in the
range of 1016 W cm−2 [4]. One consequence of this energy absorption is the
ejection of a large number of electrons from the cluster. The multiply-ionized
cluster subsequent undergoes Coulomb explosion, giving rise to the ejection
of energetic highly-charged ions [5], electrons [6], x-ray photons [7], and the
occurrence of nuclear fusion [8]. Such emissions are of obvious importance from
the viewpoint of developing tabletop sources of energetic charged particles
and photons. It is, therefore, not surprising that considerable eﬀort has been
expended in recent years to vary parameters like laser polarization [9], pulse
width [10], and chirp [11] so as to facilitate some measure of control over the
brightness and yield of the emitted charged particles and photons.

An alternative possibility of controlling cluster ionization dynamics is by al-
tering not the laser parameters but the constituents of the cluster target. This
approach was initially suggested by Castleman and coworkers [12] in the con-
text of very small clusters (of size less than ∼100 atoms); they introduced
hydrogen iodide molecules into a stream of Ar gas in a supersonic jet expan-
sion cluster source. Charge transfer processes in such few-atom clusters were
postulated to lead to a change in the charge states of Ar atoms due to the
presence of easily ionizable HI. It was also shown that when easily ionizable
HI is present in Kr cluster expansion, higher Kr charge states were obtained
[12]. Very recently, an extension of this approach has been demonstrated to
control and enhance the x-ray emission from nano-cluster plasmas that are
formed upon irradiation by intense femtosecond-duration laser pulses: when
very large argon clusters (comprising tens of thousands of atoms) are doped
with water molecules the time-integrated yield of Ar K x-ray emission has
recently been shown to be enhanced nearly twelve-fold in comparison to pure
Ar clusters under otherwise identical experimental conditions [13]. It appears
established that by using low ionization energy dopants, it becomes possible
to signiﬁcantly enhance both the high-energy ion yield and the charge states
that are obtained from heteronuclear clusters [14].

The doping of Ar clusters with H2O molecules (which have lower ionization
energy than Ar atoms) alters the ionization dynamics of the clusters: the rel-
ative ease of ionizing the water molecules increases the number of electrons
that are ionized from the cluster constituents in the initial temporal evolution
of the optical pulse. This larger number of ionized electrons brings about an
enhanced contribution to the optical ﬁeld driven electron-impact ionization.
In the laser-cluster interaction the main ionization mechanisms are (1) optical

2

ﬁeld ionization (OFI), which includes tunnel ionization and barrier suppres-
sion ionization [1,2], (2) collisional ionization [15], and (3) charge-enhanced
ionization in the combined ﬁeld of ions and the laser radiation [16]. A simple
OFI ionization model [2] estimate shows that the intensity threshold for H2O
is around three times lower than that for Ar. With our experimental param-
eters, Arn achieves 100% ionization when each Ar is converted into Ar+ at
an intensity of 2.5×1014 W cm−2 [15]. For a 100 fs FWHM Gaussian pulse
with peak laser intensity of ∼1016 W cm−2, conversion to Ar+ occurs at time
(t-117) fs, where t denotes the time at which the pulse intensity peaks. The
appearance intensity for a particular charge state of a given atom or ion is
∼ I 4
p [2], where Ip is the ionization energy of the species involved. There-
fore, one electron from each water molecule will appear at an intensity of
1×1014 W cm−2, which occurs at time (t-129) fs. Note that this time is 18
fs earlier than the time at which the ﬁrst ionization of pure argon occurred.
Furthermore, the enhanced ionization mechanism [17] that is so important
for molecular ionization in strong ﬁelds, would lead to further increase of the
ionization rate for H2O. It is, therefore, seen that the electron density is en-
hanced in (Ar-H2O)n as compared to pure Arn. To eject the second electron
from a water molecule would require another 16 eV [18,19,20]; this ionization
step would occur at time (t-114) fs. By the time the laser intensity reaches
∼2.6×1014 W cm−2, argon atoms are only singly ionized while water dopants
are already doubly ionized. The ionized electrons may still be conﬁned to the
cluster as a whole due to Coulombic forces [21]. In the intensity regime 1016
W cm−2 and for cluster sizes of more than a few nm, a substantial fraction
of electrons are trapped in the potential well of the cluster [21]. Energy from
the incident optical ﬁeld couples to the cluster-plasma through these trapped
electrons. These quasi-free electrons which are delocalized within the cluster,
oscillate under the combined inﬂuence of the rapidly-increasing intra-cluster
electrostatic ﬁeld and the intense optical ﬁeld [22], and give rise to the opti-
cal ﬁeld driven electron impact ionization we referred to above. The inherent
time-dependent nature of the entire process makes the temporal proﬁle of the
electron density a most critical parameter for deposition of optical energy into
the cluster plasma. The consequent steeper rise in the electron density proﬁle
within the cluster thus results in enhancement of the propensity of high charge
states being formed [14] as well as in signiﬁcant enhancement of the yield of
x-rays [13].

A most important lacuna that has plagued all recent reports on doped clusters
(and the spectacular eﬀects that doping produces in the context of irradiation
by short-duration, intense optical ﬁelds) is lack of quantitative information on
the level of doping that is achieved. For instance, the obvious question that
arises from experiments on water-doped Ar clusters concerns quantiﬁcation
of the percentage of water that is present in the heteronuclear cluster. The
vapor-pressure of water at room temperature is about 20 Torr. At atmospheric
pressure, a typical mixture of argon-water is expected to contain about 2.6%

3

of water. In all hitherto-reported experiments on water-doped clusters, argon
gas was bubbled through water to accomplish the doping. Therefore, on the
basis of simple partial pressure arguments pertaining to a water-argon mixture,
the upper limit on the percentage of water in the doped clusters cannot be
more than ∼2.6%. At high values of stagnation pressure of argon, at which
laser-cluster experiments are typically conducted [13,14], the proportion of
water is likely to be even less than this notional limit as factors like dynamic
momentum transfer and sticking coeﬃcients make the overall situation very
complex. These factors warrant a much more careful doping estimate than one
that is simply based on equilibrium vapor-pressure type of arguments.

The quantiﬁcation task remains challenging as a typical set-up for laser-cluster
experiments would not be equipped to analyze doping levels of a few percent.
We report here a relatively simple method based on mass spectrometry that
helps to quantify the fraction of water in a doped heteronuclear cluster in an
experimental environment that closely resembles that utilized in typical laser-
cluster experiments. We demonstrate our method with reference to the amount
of water dopant in an argon cluster, and we show that the enhancement in
laser energy absorption increases with the doping level, in consonance with
recently reported enhancements of x-ray and charged particle energies and
yields under similar water-doping circumstances.

2 Experimental Method

Our experimental technique is based upon a quadrupole mass-spectrometric
(QMS) analysis of species of various charge/mass values in a seeding situation
of the type that pertains to doped cluster formation. A schematic view of our
experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. Argon gas jet is bubbled through triply-
distilled water at various values of backing pressure. A buﬀer container is used
to avoid spluttering of water droplets inside the experimental chamber. The
Ar-water mixture is ionized by a beam of electrons of mean energy of 70 eV,
with an energy spread of ∼1 eV. The ionized gas mixture undergoes subsequent
charge/mass analysis by the QMS. The background pressure of the ionization
chamber is maintained at ∼10−7 Torr, with a typical working pressure of
∼10−6 Torr with full gas load. The pressure gauge head (Pfeiﬀer, PKR-251)
to monitor vacuum in the QMS chamber and the leak valve (Pfeiﬀer, EVR-116)
connected to the same chamber are electronically controlled through a RVC
300 controller to maintain a constant working pressure inside the experimental
chamber.

In order to recreate the experimental conditions that are typical of laser-cluster
interaction experiments, argon is bubbled through water at diﬀerent values
of backing pressures. The high-pressure argon-water mixture is then passed

4

through a T-tube, one port of which leaks a part of the mixed gas to the
atmosphere. The leak to the atmosphere is adjusted so that a maximum of 1
bar of gas pressure is behind the leak valve into the apparatus. The mixture is
then allowed to eﬀuse into the ionization chamber in a controlled way through
the RV 300 controller. As the eﬀusion rate is inversely proportional to the
square root of mass of the species, water will eﬀuse 1.49 times faster than
argon. This fact is taken into account while estimating the water content in
the mixture.

The QMS generates mass spectra that allow us to determine the area under the
curve of each m/q peak. Proper consideration of the ionization cross-sections
of argon and water allows quantiﬁcation of the proportion of each species.

For measurements of laser absorption by doped and undoped clusters, we used
a supersonic, solenoid-operated Parker General Valve that was ﬁtted with a
500 µm nozzle of 45◦ half expansion angle [13]. The cluster sizes were esti-
mated using the empirical Hagena parameter [2,15]. Within the experimental
parameters used in our measurements, the cluster size varies from about 350
atoms at 2 bar to about 15000 atoms at 10 bar. A Ti:Sapphire laser system
that delivers up to 55 mJ (800 nm, wavelength) of 100 fs pulses at 10 Hz repe-
tition rate was used. Laser pulses of energy up to 10 mJ/pulse were focused in
the supersonic jet expansion by a 25 cm plano-convex lens to attain intensities
in the 1015 W cm−2 range. The scattered and transmitted 800 nm light was
measured using a combination of bandpass ﬁlters and energy-calibrated, fast
photodiodes placed at various locations.

It is relevant to mention that while our method is very simple, it is not ex-
pected to be as accurate as the standard gravimetric method used by gas-
phase reaction kineticists [23,24]. Our primary aim is to estimate the water
content in mixed Ar-water clusters. In typical laser-cluster experiments, a
major source of uncertainty lies in cluster size determination. The standard
Hagena method [2,15] of estimation of cluster size gives the value of mean
cluster size irrespective of the distribution of cluster sizes around the mean
value. (A detailed discussion of cluster size distributions has been presented
elsewhere , see [25], and references therein.) The Hagena estimate has an in-
herent error of about 30%. With this limitation on cluster size information,
the accuracy of the method we present here suﬃces. Moreover, the simplicity
of the method enables a nearly “on-line” determination of doping levels to be
made, a facet that normal gravimetric methods would not allow. We also note
that mass ﬂow controllers used in the gravimetric method usually do not work
reliably in the pressure range much above 3 bar while doped cluster formation
experiments usually require considerably higher pressure values.

3 Results and Discussion

Figure 2 shows the percentage of water that is present in the mixture as a
function of stagnation pressure, as estimated from the QMS spectra. Particular
care has been taken to get a “true” sample of the argon-water mixture: the
proportion of water in the mixture is estimated as follows. At an incident
electron energy of 70 eV, we take the electron impact ionization cross-section
for the ﬁrst ionization of neutral Ar to be 2.67 (in units of 10−16 cm2), while
that for the second ionization is 0.146 [26]. In case of water, the respective
cross-sections for ionization to H2O+ and OH+ are 1.62 and 0.95 [27]. The
inset in Fig. 2 shows a typical QMS trace when a mixture of argon and water
sample was obtained upon bubbling argon through water at 5 bar backing
pressure and, thereafter, being ionized by 70 eV electrons. Individual m/q
species are indicated by arrows.

The proportion of water is seen to initially increase with backing pressure,
starting from about 2.5% doping level at 1 bar backing pressure to a maximum
of about 7% doping level at nearly 6 bar backing pressure. Thereafter, the
doping level falls to about 2% at 8 bar. It is relevant to emphasize here that
at backing pressure of 1 bar, the experimental measurement yields a value
of 2.5% as water doping level; this value is, within the associated error bars,
quite consistent with the value that is deduced using simple partial pressure
arguments, as discussed in the Introduction. However, with increase of the
argon backing pressure, a larger amount of argon (as density is proportional
to the pressure) becomes available to “push” water molecules into forming a
mixture. But, as pressure is further increased, the bulk ﬂow velocity of argon
atoms increases and, as argon gas bubbles through a ﬁnite column of water,
the time that an argon atom makes contact with water reduces, as does the
likelihood of momentum transfer. Consequently, there is competition between
the inverse of time (∼velocity) that argon spends in the vicinity of water
and the number density of argon atoms. Beyond a certain value of pressure,
in our case around 6 bar, the higher ﬂow velocity of argon atoms becomes
more important than the increment in argon atom density. Consequently, the
amount of water that is carried by the swiftly ﬂowing argon atoms is reduced.
In order to reproduce the experimental conditions used in the typical doped
cluster experiments [13,14], the ﬂow conditions which include the stagnation
pressure, diameter of the gas line, height of water column, etc. were kept as
close to those in [13,14] as possible. For this reason alone we do not need to
take into account the change in temperature of water as argon at high pressure
was allowed to pass through it: our measurements do not need to make an
absolute determination of the number of water molecules. After measurement
of relative H2O and Ar ion signals at each value of stagnation pressure we
replenished the water sample and allowed suﬃcient time between subsequent
measurements to allow for temperature equilibration.

Figure 3 shows a typical mass spectral trace when argon was directly fed
into our ionization chamber, bypassing the water reservoir. This measurement
provides an estimate for the background water present in the experimental
chamber and gas-feed lines and provides an aid to properly estimating the
actual doping level in the argon-water mixture. As can be estimated from Fig.
3, the relative yield of H2O+ and OH+ is 1.1, while the ionization cross-sections
would indicate this to be about 1.7. There are likely to be other sources of
OH+ in the ionization chamber, but the measured ratio is properly accounted
for in all data analysis.

In order to correlate the extent of doping with the enhancements that have
been recently reported in the interactions of intense, short-duration laser light
with doped clusters we also carried out laser absorption measurements. Fig-
ure 4 shows some typical results of absorption measurements that we made for
pure and doped Ar clusters as a function of stagnation pressure, using a ﬁxed
laser intensity of ∼1015 W cm−2. We collected the scattered 800 nm laser light
along the laser polarization, and at an angle of 90o to it, and also the transmit-
ted light using a combination of bandpass ﬁlters and energy-calibrated, fast
photodiodes placed at various locations. Given the relevant diﬀerential scatter-
ing cross-section [28,30], these measurements suﬃce to give a good estimate of
the absorbed laser energy. Our measurements were conﬁned to relatively low
values of stagnation pressure but, nevertheless, they suﬃce to clearly demon-
strate that absorption of laser energy is signiﬁcantly more in the case of doped
cluster. It is seen that within the parameter ranges of the experiments, the
diﬀerence in absorption follows the trend that is indicated by the doping levels
that can be quantiﬁed from data shown in Fig. 2. In the following we present
a possible scenario which could explain the enhancement in the absorption of
laser energy in case of doped clusters.

Clusters sizes of the type of relevance to the present study are typically a few
nm, which are much smaller than the wavelength (800 nm) of the laser used
in such experiments. Therefore, a cluster will experience an optical ﬁeld that
is uniform across its dimensions. Consequently, the typical Rayleigh type of
dipole model ought to suﬃce in order to account for most of the observed light
scattering phenomena [28] and, indeed, this is found to be the case for a large
number of absorption and scattering type of laser-cluster experiments [1,2,30].
In this model, the absorption cross-section for a cluster of radius r is given by

σabs = 4πkr3Im[(ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 2)],

(1)

where k = ω/c is the propagation constant of the laser (see [30], and references
therein, ω is the angular frequency of the laser light and c is its speed in
vacuum. ǫ is the dielectric constant of the cluster medium and is given within

7

the simple Drude model [15,?] by

ǫ = 1 − ω2

(2)

where ωp denotes the plasma frequency and ν is the electron-ion collision
frequency. For a 1 keV plasma exposed to laser intensity of ∼1015 W cm−2,
the electron-ion collision frequency for a typical argon cluster turns out to be
0.21 fs−1 [29], considering the typical ionic charge to be 8 and electron density
in the argon cluster to be 160 nm−3. These values are reasonable as the charge
state of 8+ for Ar40,000 clusters has been directly demonstrated by means of
two-dimensional time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry [9,31]. Using these values,
it is possible to deduce an estimate of Im[(ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 2)] to be 3.3×10−3 for
homonuclear clusters of Ar atoms. Taking the percentage of water dopant in
our heteronuclear clusters to be around 10%, as has been demonstrated in our
data, and considering the parameters used in very recent experiments on ion
ejection from doped Ar-H2O clusters [14], the estimate for Im[(ǫ − 1)/(ǫ + 2)]
turns out to be about 23% larger for water-doped clusters. However, as is clear
from our experimental data, the actual enhancement of absorption between
undoped and doped clusters is more than a factor of two over the entire range
of stagnation pressures (cluster sizes) in our experiment. This discrepancy
points to the need to develop models that will adequately take account of
the fact that the optical ﬁeld induces eﬀects in clusters that are essentially
nonlinear in nature. The model that is used here, and by others [1,2] takes
cognizance of only linear eﬀects.

We note that there is recent experimental evidence that doping does not entail
a change in the size of the cluster [13]. The variation of the absorption with
pressure that we observe is in consonance with the only earlier report [4]
available in the literature.

In summary, we have presented a very simple technique to estimate the water
content in water-doped argon clusters. Our techniques is applicable to many
other doping situations in the context of heteronuclear clusters. Doped clus-
ters have recently assumed much importance in the light of very signiﬁcant
enhancement in charged particle and photon emissions that ensue upon inter-
actions with ultrashort, intense laser pulse. The estimated percent of water
dopant in the mixed clusters has also been correlated with the laser absorp-
tion measurements that we have conducted. Doped clusters absorb laser energy
much more eﬃciently. Our results show that quantiﬁcation of doping levels is
possible and this will open the way for more studies on the role of low ioniza-
tion energy dopants in the strong-ﬁeld dynamics of laser-cluster interactions.
Our energy absorption measurements show that a signiﬁcant enhancement oc-
curs when argon clusters are doped with water. It is not possible to rationalize
the extent of enhancement using a linear model of the type that is reported

8

in the literature [1,2]. Our data brings to the fore the need to develop ade-
quate nonlinear models that will properly account for energy absorption by
the cluster from the optical ﬁeld.

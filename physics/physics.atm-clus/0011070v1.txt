(November 2000)

For the energy absorption of atomic clusters as a function of the laser pulse duration we ﬁnd a
similar behavior as it has been observed for metallic clusters [K¨oller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
82, 3783 (1999)]. In both situations there exists an optimum radius Ro of the cluster for energy
absorption. In the metallic case the existence of Ro has been interpreted as a consequence of the
collective oscillation of a delocalized electron cloud in resonance with the laser frequency. Here, we
give evidence that in the atomic cluster the origin of Ro is very diﬀerent. Based on ﬁeld assisted
tunneling it can be related to the phenomenon of enhanced ionization as it occurs in small molecules.
The dependence of Ro on the laser frequency turns out to be the key quantity to distinguish the
processes.

PACS numbers: 36.40 -c, 33.80 Rv, 36.40 Gk

Exposed to an intense laser pulse a cluster absorbs
a considerable amount of energy which is released sub-
sequently through fragmentation into fast electrons [1],
multicharged ions [2] and radiation in the x-ray regime
[3]. These eﬀects depend on the seize of the cluster, i.e.,
the number of constituent atoms and the pulse duration,
somewhat less on the kind of atoms and the wavelength
of the light.

In a recent experiment K¨oller et al. measured the in-
tensity dependent energy absorption of a cluster consist-
ing of some ten platinum atoms as a function of laser
pulse duration [4]. This has been done by keeping the
energy content (ﬂuence) of the laser pulse constant and
varying the pulse duration as well as the peak intensity
accordingly.

Interestingly, the absorbed energy decreases with in-
creasing laser intensity, after having reached a maximum.
We have found the same behavior in calculations for
atomic clusters containing a similar number of atoms.
However, as we will see below, the mechanism responsi-
ble for the phenomenon is quite diﬀerent from the one
described in [4] for the metallic clusters.

We will show that a sensitive indicator for the underly-
ing mechanism is the existence of an optimal mean inter-
nuclear distance Ro for energy absorption which changes
with the laser frequency ω for a cluster of delocalized
electrons (a metal cluster) while it is independent of ω in
the case of an atomic cluster. In both cases the existence
of Ro is also the origin of the peculiarity that the energy
absorption can decrease with increasing peak intensity of
the laser, as mentioned above.

In order to discriminate between diﬀerent mechanisms
we had to choose an approach which is capable of han-
dling, at least in principle, both situations: atomic clus-
ters with localized electrons and delocalized electrons
as they are typical for metallic behavior. Furthermore,

the numerical treatment had to be fast enough to follow
an appreciable number of particles (ions and electrons).
Clearly, this cannot be done fully quantum mechanically,
for the time being. Our approach is a combination of the
ones described in [6–9], i.e., essentially based on classical
equations of motion for all ionized charged particles un-
der full mutual Coulomb interactions. As in [7] we have
used Coulomb soft-core potentials

Ve(r) = (r2 + a2)

−1/2 .

(1)

We will see later, that the choice of a allows us to describe
an atomic cluster with localized electrons (aa ∼ 1a.u.) or
to simulate a metallic cluster with delocalized electrons
(am ≫ aa).

The initial ionization of an electron bound to an atom
or ion is described with an analytically known rate [5],
dependent on the instant (static) electric ﬁeld at the po-
sition of the atom/ion to be ionized. The ﬁeld is created
by all surrounding charges (ions and electrons) and the
laser. In contrast to [7] we do not include additional elec-
tron impact ionization. Its eﬀect is small (see [9]), more-
over, its implementation based on empirical cross sec-
tions, such as the Lotz formula, bares the danger that the
contribution of electrons to ionization is counted twice:
through ﬁeld ionization and through additional impact
ionization.

The actual computation goes as follows: After a relax-
ation to an equilibrium under Lennard-Jones potentials
the atomic conﬁguration is exposed to the laser pulse.
We compute a probability for ionization for each atom
(later ion) from the rate in an time interval ∆t.
Is it
larger than a generated random number 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, the
atom is considered as ’ionized’ [12] and turns into an
ion, and a new electron is created outside the instant po-
tential barrier with zero kinetic energy. The ionization
rate for the ion is adjusted to the corresponding higher

1

binding energy and the procedure is repeated, of course,
simultaneously for all atoms/ions. Newton’s equations
are solved for the time evolution of all charged particles
interacting through mutual Coulomb soft-core potentials
Eq. (1) with a2 = 2a.u..

In the following we will discuss the energy transfer to
a Ne16 cluster from a laser pulse with sin2-envelope and
an optical frequency of ω = 0.055 a.u.. If we record the
energy gain after the pulse as a function of pulse duration
T , we obtain Fig. 1. Since for constant ﬂuence under a
variation of T , the peak intensity behaves as I ∝ 1/T , one
recognizes the increasing energy absorption for decreas-
ing intensity. Only for very short pulses (high intensities)
the trend is reversed indicating that in this regime the
pure atomic response dominates cooperate cluster eﬀects.
An analogous behavior of the energy absorption, includ-
ing the rise for very short pulses, is found in calculations
for excitation of an Na9 cluster [11], and in the exper-
iment on platinum clusters (exempliﬁed by the depen-
dence of the charge states for ejected ions as a function
of the pulse duration, see Fig. 2 in [4]).

pulse duration T (a.u.)

FIG. 1. Absorbed energy as a function of laser pulse du-
ration T for constant ﬂuence such that a peak intensity of
1015W/cm2 is reached with a pulse of 20 cycles (ω = 0.055
a.u.). Note that an atomic time unit is 0.0242 fs. The line is
to guide the eye.

The authors of [4] provided an appealing interpretation
in terms of a plasma model for the delocalized electron
density of the platinum cluster: The eigenfrequency Ω of
the electron cloud depends on its density, which, in turn,
is a function of the cluster radius, i.e. Ω = Ω(R(t)).
When the cluster expands due to the net positive charge
after initial ionization, the electron density decreases and
so does the plasma frequency Ω which will eventually
match the laser frequency ω. Then, energy absorption
becomes resonant and is greatly enhanced. The maxi-
mum in the absorption as a function of pulse duration is
now essentially a matching problem: The best condition
is a coincidence of the peak intensity with the time when
Ω(R(t)) = ω. If the laser pulse is too short, the resonance
condition is reached when the pulse is already over. On

the other hand, if the pulse is too long, the cluster has
expanded beyond Ro when the peak intensity is reached.

the mean over all individual internuclear distances Ri.
Equivalently, we will speak of the cluster radius which is
directly proportional to R for a ﬁxed number of atoms
in the cluster [12]. Typically, R(t) increases adiabatically
slowly compared to the electronic and optical time scales.
This allows us to gain more insight into the dynamics by
considering the energy absorption of the cluster for dif-
ferent but ﬁxed mean internuclear separations R. Figure
2a demonstrates that the energy absorption for ﬁxed R
peaks at a critical Ro independent of the laser frequency.
This is a key observation which has several conse-
quences: Firstly, the existence of Ro for an atomic cluster
explains the shape of the energy absorption in Fig. 1 with
a maximum due to the monotonic increase of R as a func-
tion of time. Large energy absorption occurs for a pulse
duration T such that peak intensity is reached at T /2,
when the cluster has the optimal seize R(T /2) ≈ Ro.
Secondly, the mechanism which leads to the existence of
Ro must be diﬀerent from the one proposed for a metal
cluster in [4], since a resonant absorption with Ω(Ro) = ω
points to optimal cluster radii Ro which change with the
frequency ω. Rather, the mechanism we have identiﬁed
for these relatively small atomic clusters is akin to a be-
havior in small molecules which has been described under
the name enhanced ionization [13] or CREI (charge reso-
nant enhanced ionization) [14]. In short, the idea is that
in a diatomic molecule the electron, localized on one atom
most of the time due to the oscillatory light ﬁeld, can eas-
ier tunnel through the barrier formed by the attractive
Coulomb potential and the electric ﬁeld since this bar-
rier is lowered by the additional electric ﬁeld generated
by the neighboring (positively charged) nucleus.

An optimal internuclear distance Ro for this ﬁeld as-
sisted tunneling exists since in the united atom limit
R = 0 there is only one well (and deeper binding) while
in the separated atom limit R → ∞ the additional ﬁeld
simply goes to zero. The signature of this mechanism
is the existence of Ro and its independence of the laser
frequency ω, precisely as seen in Fig. 2a. Hence, the
mechanism of ﬁeld assisted tunneling is indeed also op-
erative for our cluster where many surrounding charged
ions form a strong ﬁeld for the speciﬁc atom or ion to be
ionized in the cluster.

Having established the origin of the peculiar behavior
of energy absorption in an atomic cluster as a function
of laser pulse duration, we may subject our modelling of
cluster dynamics to an ultimate test by comparing exact
quantum results for the simplest system H +
2 to predic-
tions from our approach. This is done in one dimension

ﬁxed mean interatomic distance R at two diﬀerent laser frequencies, ω = 0.055 a.u. (solid), ω = 0.11 a.u. (dashed) and with

2 as a function of ﬁxed internuclear distance with the one
dimensional quantum result (solid) and the present tunneling approach (dashed) at a peak intensity of I = 5.6×1013W/cm2.

(where the internuclear axis is aligned along the electric
ﬁeld of the laser) in Fig. 2c. Although we model the
bound electron being attached to one proton and calcu-
late its tunneling rate subject to the laser ﬁeld and the
ﬁeld generated by the second proton, the actual ioniza-
tion probability is in surprisingly good agreement with
the exact quantum result, particularly compared to a
purely classical over barrier model whose ionization yield
is too small to be visible in Fig. 2c. Note that Ro for
the cluster (Fig. 2a) is even roughly equal to Ro in H +
2
(Fig. 2c).

Designed for an interaction of several ions with many
electrons and an intense laser pulse the fairly accurate
description of H +
2 is an unexpected conﬁrmation of the
modelling. However, it raises also the question if the
mechanism we have identiﬁed for energy absorption in
clusters being akin to that for molecules in intense laser
ﬁelds is merely a consequence of the modelling which
seems to be ideally suited to describe tunneling related
phenomena.

To doublecheck that our result is independent of the
modelling and also, to clarify further the diﬀerent mech-
anism which seems to be responsible for the (similar)
energy absorption and existence of a critical mean dis-
tance Ro in metal clusters we have simulated within our
approach the behavior of delocalized electrons as they
occur in a metal cluster. This has been achieved by arti-
ﬁcially softening the potential Eq. (1) with a2 = 30 a.u..
As a consequence the cluster ions at equilibrium distance
of each other form one structureless well for the ”collec-
tive ” binding of the electrons. Comparing the excitation
spectrum of the electrons, one sees for the original situ-
ation of atomic clusters with localized electrons a single
peak which corresponds to the local excitation (Fig. 3a)
while for the delocalized electrons with a2 = 30 one sees
two peaks (Fig. 3b), the lower and wider one corresponds

is true, we would expect in our model for delocalized
electrons a dependence of the optimal cluster radius for
energy absorption on the laser frequency. This is indeed
the case, as one can see in Fig. 2b. As expected for a de-
creasing electron density with growing cluster radius, and
corresponding decreasing eigenfrequency Ω of the elec-
tron cloud, we ﬁnd that Ro is smaller for the higher laser
frequency.

This conﬁrms the existence of a diﬀerent mechanism
which leads to a critical cluster radius in a situation of
delocalized electrons, in accordance with what has been
found by very diﬀerent modelling of the valence electrons
in sodium clusters [15,16]. It also demonstrates that our

the plasmon induced absorption mechanism and rather
would have to conclude that the ﬁeld assisted tunneling
scenario is a universal mechanism for intense laser ﬁeld
ionization in molecules and clusters of moderate seize.

formulation of intense ﬁeld dynamics of clusters is ca-
pable of describing both, atomic clusters with localized
electrons and, at least qualitatively, the situation of delo-
calized electrons as they occur in metal clusters. Hence,
the result reassures that the mechanism of ﬁeld enhanced
ionization by surrounding charged particles is not an ar-
tifact of the theoretical description.

To summarize, we have found that the energy absorp-
tion in small atomic clusters depends strongly on the laser
pulse duration, similarly as in metallic clusters and large
(N ≈ 106) atomic clusters. However, the mechanism is
very diﬀerent. While in metallic cluster [4] as well as
in large atomic clusters [17] a similar plasmon resonance
mechanism prominently involving delocalized electrons
has been advocated to explain the observations, we ﬁnd
that in small atomic clusters ﬁeld assisted tunneling is re-
sponsible. By making use of the adiabaticity of the ionic
motion compared to the electronic motion we could show
that a critical cluster radius exists for maximum energy
absorption which is independent of the laser frequency ω.
This behavior is akin to the one known from diatomic
molecules as ”enhanced ionization ” [13,14] and can be
attributed to the same physical eﬀect of ﬁeld assisted
tunneling ionization. As a sideﬀect, we have shown that
our approach also describes the ionization of the smallest
molecule, H +

2 , in a strong laser pulse rather well.

Furthermore, we have simulated the behavior of delo-
calized electrons within the same theoretical approach.
Thereby, we could conﬁrm that for delocalized electrons
enhanced energy absorption can be attributed to a plas-
mon type resonance. It occurs when the eigenfrequency
of the delocalized electron density and the laser frequency
agree, as suggested by K¨oller etal to interpret their ex-
periment [4]. However, we could only clearly identify this
type of resonance behavior if exclusively the valence elec-
trons are involved in the ionization dynamics, i.e., if the
laser intensity is suﬃciently weak (in our case 3.51 × 1012
W/cm2). Once electrons from the ionic cores are ionized,
the local character of the electron binding starts to domi-
nate. Moreover, ﬁeld ionization triggered by surrounding
charges takes over the ionization caused by the collective
electron cloud and the laser ﬁeld. Since in the experi-
ment [4] the peak intensity of the laser was rather large
(more than 1015 W/cm2) and highly charged ions have
been detected (which probably were even higher charged
through the initial ionization before recombination took
place), it is possible that the actual mechanism for the
energy absorption pattern as a function of pulse duration
is closer to that of ﬁeld assisted tunneling as in atomic
clusters than to the plasmon resonance enhanced ioniza-
tion of metallic valence electrons. As we have shown, the
two mechanisms diﬀer by their dependence on the laser
frequency. Hence, it would be desirable to repeat the
experiment of [4] at a higher laser frequency, the best
choice being an ω high enough that the resonance condi-
tion cannot be fullﬁlled. If the energy absorption pattern

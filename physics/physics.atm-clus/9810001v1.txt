Abstract

The parity-allowed two-photon transitions between the ground state 3A2(T2) of the
conﬁguration 3d8 in cubical symmetry and the excited states of the same conﬁguration
are obtained via a simple model. This model is developed in a symmetry adapted
framework by using second-order mechanisms and ionic wave-functions. It is applied to
the recent experimental results obtained by McClure and co-workers for Ni2+ in MgO.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years, two-photon absorption spectroscopy of partly-ﬁlled shell (rare-

earth and transition-metal) ions in solids have received a great deal of attention. Major

achievements have been done both from an experimental and theoretical viewpoint (see,

for instance, Refs. 1-13). The main theoretical developments concern : (i) the use, in

addition to the Axe second-order mechanism, of higher order mechanisms describing

spin-orbit, crystal-ﬁeld, ligand polarizibility, and electron correlation eﬀects and (ii) the

application of symmetry adaptation techniques. More speciﬁcally, it has been shown

recently how quantitative, rather than only qualitative,2 symmetry considerations can

be used to obtain the polarization dependence of a two-photon absorption between two

Stark (rather than [2S+1L]J ) levels.8,9,11

Recently, results on two-photon spectroscopy of Ni2+ in MgO have been reported by

Moncorg´e and Benyattou12 and by McClure and co-workers.13 It is then the aim of the

present paper to further contribute to test theoretical models for analysing two-photon

spectroscopy by using the fresh data of Ref. 13.

We shall develop, in Secs. II and III, a simple quantitative model for dealing with

the d8 (or d2) conﬁguration in octahedral symmetry. The results provided by this model

for MgO:Ni2+ are given in Sec. IV and discussed in Sec. V.

The transition matrix element Mi→f for a two-photon absorption between an initial

state i and a ﬁnal state f is given by the G¨oppert-Mayer formula

where the sum on v extends over all intermediate states. In Eq. (1), Ev denotes the

identical photons and use single mode excitations of the radiation ﬁeld with energy ¯hω,

wave vector ~k, and unit polarization vector ~

. Equation (1) is derived in the framework

electrons of the conﬁguration 3d8 while ~D. ~
E

stands for the scalar product of ~D and ~
E

.

The sum on v in (1) can be handled by using a quasi-closure approximation.1 As a

result, Mi→f turns out to be the matrix element of an eﬀective operator Hef f between

the initial and ﬁnal electronic state vectors.1,3 Following the phenomenological argument

of Ref. 8, the operator Hef f may be extended to the form

Hef f =

k can be only 0 and 2 for identical photons. The electronic dependence is contained

in the double tensor W(kS kL)k of spin rank kS, orbital rank kL, and total rank k.

The electronic and polarization parts are coupled together through the scalar product

(.) occuring in (2). The parameters C [(kSkL)k] depend on the conﬁguration 3d8 and

on the 3d7n′ℓ′ and n′ℓ′4ℓ

+13d9 conﬁgurations to which the intermediate state vectors

′

belong (the most important excited conﬁguration is probably 3d74p). These parameters

are clearly model-dependent and may be calculated from ﬁrst principles. For example,

the parameter C[(02)2], which we shall use in Sec. IV, reads

In Eq. (2), the contribution (kS = 0, kL = 2, k = 2) described by (3) corresponds
to the second-order mechanism ﬁrst introduced by Axe.1 The other contributions (kS 6

0, kL, k) correspond to higher-order mechanisms ; in particular, the contribution (kS =

1, kL = 1, k = 0) may correspond to third-order mechanisms taking into account the

spin-orbit interaction within the 3d7n′ℓ′ conﬁgurations.

(Contributions of the type

(kS 6
ions.) Alternatively, the contributions (kS 6

(6)

The c parameters in (4) and (6) may be obtained by diagonalizing, within the con-

ﬁguration 3d8, some Hamiltonian describing the Coulomb, spin-orbit, and crystal-ﬁeld

interactions. When dealing with Eq. (9) below, it is important to note that the parame-

ters c(SLJΓ; i) and c(S′L′J ′Γ′; f ) can be chosen in such a way that they do not depend

on γ (for Γ ﬁxed) and γ′ (for Γ′ ﬁxed), respectively.

The matrix element Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) of the operator Hef f between the state vectors

(4) and (6) may be calculated by using the Wigner-Racah algebra for the chain of groups

for circular polarization. We shall continue to develop the formalism for a general

polarization although the experimental results in Ref. 13 are concerned only with a

linear polarization for which the polar angles (Φ, θ) are Φ = π/2 and θ = 0 or π/4 ; this

will enable us to make some theoretical predictions in Sec. V.

The number of independent χ parameters in (10) is controlled by the two following

rules. First, we have a group-theoretical rule indicating that the sum over Γ′′ in Eq. (10)

is limited by

Γ′′

(k) ,

(ℓ) ,

(16)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

where (k) and (ℓ) refer to IRC’s of the group SO(3) and Γ′∗

Γ is the Kronecker product

⊗

of Γ′∗

Γ′ and Γ. Therefore, the possible Γ′′ in (10) are determined once the range of

≡

values for k and ℓ as well as the symmetries Γ and Γ′ of the initial and ﬁnal states are

known. Second, the range of values for k and ℓ is partly ﬁxed by the following model-

dependent rule. For identical photons, we have : (i) either k, ℓ = 2 for second-order

mechanism (corresponding to kS = 0) or (ii) k, ℓ = 0 and 2 for second- plus third-order

mechanisms (corresponding to kS = 0 plus kS 6
conjunction with a model for determining the initial and ﬁnal state vectors, allow us to

= 0). The two preceeding rules, used in

restrict the sums on k, ℓ, and Γ′′ in the basic intensity formula (1), as we shall see in

Secs. III and IV.

III. APPLICATION

We now apply the formalism described in Sec. II to the case where i = 3A2(T2)

for the initial state and f = 3T2(A2, E, T1, T2), 1E(E), 3T1(A1, E, T1, T2), 1T2(T2), and
1A1(A1) for the ﬁnal states. We thus have Γ = T2 and Γ′ = A1, A2, E, T1, T2. Since

(0) = A1 and (2) = E

T2 in terms of IRC’s of O, Eq. (10) can be simpliﬁed to give

It should be observed that r = 0 if we restrict ourselves to second-order mechanisms.

Equation (23) gives the detailed polarization dependence of the intensity for the

various two-photon transitions. For linear polarization, Eq. (23) can be particularized

to the special case θ = 0 and θ = π/4 corresponding to the experimental results reported

in Ref. 13 (light polarized along the (100) and (110) axes, respectively). Then, the ratios

considered in Ref. 13 for the transitions 3A2(T2)

IV. RESULT

The intensity parameters χ[kΓ′′; T2Γ′] in Eq. (24) can be obtained with the help of
the deﬁnition (11). The expansion coeﬃcients c(SLJΓ; i) and c(S′L′J ′Γ′; f ) in Eq. (11)

can be derived by diagonalizing the appropriate Hamiltonian within the conﬁguration

3d8. Such a diagonalization has been done by Campochiaro et al.13 who used the

simple model developed by Liehr and Ballhausen.17 However, the wave-functions in

9

Ref. 13 are given in the strong-ﬁeld basis and, in order to get the c coeﬃcients, they

have to be transformed to the weak-ﬁeld basis. This can be achieved by means of the

transformation matrices set up in Ref. 17. As a result, the wave-functions corresponding

to the sixteen strong-ﬁeld states considered in Ref. 13 are described in Table I in a weak-

ﬁeld basis.

Looking at Table I, we note that in most cases the dominating weak-ﬁeld com-

ponents of the initial state 3A2(T2) can be connected to the dominating weak-ﬁeld

components of the ﬁnal state via the tensor operator W(02)2 arising in the standard

second-order model of intra-conﬁgurational two-photon absorption. This is an indi-

cation that the second-order mechanism depicted by C[(02)2] in Eq. (11) should be

suﬃcient to interpret the two-photon transitions in the case of Ni2+ in MgO. We may

then limit our analysis to the contribution (kS = 0, kL = 2, k = 2). The only free

parameter is then C[(02)2]. It can be calculated from

which follows from Eq. (3) provided we restrict the sum over n′ℓ′ to n′ℓ′

By following the scheme just described, we ﬁnally obtain the values of the χ param-

eters, the intensity parameters (23), and the intensities (27). These intensities together

with the ratio R are presented in Table II.

V. CONCLUSION

We have concentrated in this paper on a model for describing two-photon intra-

conﬁgurational transitions for an ion with d8 or d2 conﬁguration in a surrounding of

octahedral symmetry. The model is based on the consideration of second-order mecha-

nisms with ionic wave-functions as the initial and ﬁnal state vectors. Furthermore, the

information on symmetry manifests itself in this model through the quantitative use of

symmetry adaptation techniques for the chain of groups SO(3)

O. The model leads to

⊃

intensity formulas in the spirit of those derived in Refs. 8, 9, and 11 for a conﬁguration

nℓN in an arbitrary symmetry. These formulas exhibit the polarization dependence for

linearly and circularly polarized photons in terms of intensity parameters which depend

on a single parameter (viz., C[(02)2]).

In the case of linearly polarized photons, the application of the latter formulas to

Ni2+ in MgO yields theoretical intensities in reasonable agreement with the experimental

values of Ref. 13. There is no experimental result for circularly polarized photons, so

that our results provide predictions in this case.

Our results concern the two-photon transitions from the ground state 3A2(T2) to

11

the ﬁrst ﬁfteen excited states of MgO:Ni2+. The polarization ratios R1 and R2 deﬁned

by Eq. (25) for the transitions 3A2(T2)

3T2(E, T1) are of special interest for testing

→

purposes because of the particularly good resolution of these transitions. The reported

experimental values of R1 and R2 are 3.0 and 1.1, respectively. From Table II, we can

obtain the theoretical values of R1 and R2 : we ﬁnd R1 ≡
using Eq. (25), R2 = 1.04. Note that the theoretical values obtained in Ref. 13 are

R = 0.95 and we calculate,

R1 = 220 and R2 = 25. To get the experimental values of R1 and R2, the parameters

u2, v2, and w2 occurring in Eq. (23) would have to satisfy the relations u2/w2 = 0.28 and

v2/w2 = 1. The introduction of the latter relations into Eq. (23) may give predictions

on the polarization dependence of the transitions 3A2(T2)

3T2(E, T1) for any value

→

of θ in term of a single parameter (say, w2).

Is it possible to improve the model ? As can be easily proved, the third-order

(spin-orbit) correction3,4 has in our case very limited signiﬁcance. First, its leading

term is proportional to the tensor operator W(11)0 and gives a vanishing contribution

since this operator cannot link 3A2(T2) and 3T2(E, T1). Second, the reamaining terms

(arising from the tensors W(1kL)2) give, according to an aside calculation, corrections

of an order of a few percents.

Another possible improvement of the model might come, as already mentioned by

McClure and co-workers,13 from dynamic contributions of the ligands. In this respect,

however, much more extensive and involved studies are needed to reach conclusions.

To close, it is worth noticing that the approach presented in Secs. II and III can

be extended to any other transition-metal ion or any rare-earth ion in an arbitrary

symmetry, possibly with two diﬀerent photons (see Ref. 11 for further details). We also

mention that a similar formalism can be developed for inter-conﬁgurational two-photon

transitions.21

Kinetic approach to the cluster liquid-gas transition

The liquid-gas transition in free atomic clusters is investigated theoretically based on simple
unimolecular rate theories and assuming sequential evaporations. A kinetic Monte Carlo scheme is
used to compute the time-dependent properties of clusters undergoing multiple dissociations, and
two possible deﬁnitions of the boiling point are proposed, relying on the cluster or gas temperature.
This numerical approach is supported by molecular dynamics simulations of clusters made of sodium
atoms or C60 molecules, as well as simpliﬁed rate equation.

PACS numbers: 36.40.Qv,82.60.Qr,05.10.Ln

Boiling is often considered as archetypal of ﬁrst-order
phase transitions in bulk matter. Recent experimental
evidence [1, 2, 3, 4] suggests that the liquid-gas tran-
sition also occurs in ﬁnite atomic systems. The caloric
curves measured for sodium [1], hydrogen [2] or stron-
tium [3] clusters exhibit a plateau or a backbending, be-
lieved to be signatures of a phase transition rounded by
size eﬀects. Similar conclusions have been inferred from
collisions between gold nuclei [5]. The experiments per-
formed by Pochodzalla and coworkers have since moti-
vated a signiﬁcant amount of theoretical work to help the
search for a possible equation of state for nuclear matter
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

For more than two decades, fragmentation has been
recognized as one of the most convenient ways of ac-
cessing fundamental cluster properties such as binding
energies or temperatures. These quantities were related
to each other through calorimetric experiments on the
solid-liquid phase change [11, 12]. The crucial role of the
observation time was also noticed at an early stage, and
more fully understood by Klots [13] who introduced the
concept of the evaporative ensemble. Free clusters are
never strictly stable when their energy exceeds a certain
dissociation threshold, as fragmentation will occur, pos-
sibly very late. Measurements on free clusters are thus
conducted on species resulting from hotter and bigger
clusters, and which have suﬃciently cooled down so as
not to evaporate further. Unfortunately, the relatively
long times involved in experiments (usually the µs–ms
range) have prevented Klots’ ideas from being exploited
in later theoretical studies. While melting can be con-
veniently addressed using Monte Carlo (MC) or molecu-
lar dynamics (MD) simulations by artiﬁcially keeping the
cluster in a container [14], fragmentation of a cluster into
vacuum is an out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. The dif-
ﬁculty of accounting for the time variable has generally
been circumvented by considering lattice-gas or percola-
tion models [8, 10] as well as periodic boundary condi-
tions [6, 9].

Unimolecular rate theories provide a general frame-
work to describe single dissociation events accurately and
over long time scales [15]. Here we introduce a kinetic

Monte Carlo (KMC) scheme based on such rate theories
to calculate the caloric curves of clusters across the liquid-
gas transition for arbitrarily long observation times.

We start by illustrating the boiling problem by show-
ing the results of classical MD simulations carried out
on three selected clusters, namely Na55, (C60)40, and
a model binary cluster X13Y42. These systems are de-
scribed using an explicit many-body potential [16], the
Girifalco potential [17], and Lennard-Jones (LJ) interac-
tions, respectively. For the LJ cluster, we chose εXX = 1,
εYY = 1/2 and εXY = 1/√2, all distance units and
masses being set to one. For each cluster, MD trajectories
are performed starting from the lowest-energy minimum,
at increasing total energies and zero angular and linear
momenta. After some observation time t we determine
the biggest remaining cluster as the largest set of con-
nected atoms or molecules, two atoms being connected
when their distance is smaller than a cut-oﬀ value rcut
chosen as twice the equilibrium distance. The instanta-
neous temperature of this cluster is then calculated after
removing the overall translation and rotation contribu-
tions. The average cluster size and temperature obtained
over 100 independent trajectories (20 for the longest wait-
ing times) are represented for the three clusters in Fig. 1.
All caloric curves exhibit two clearly distinct regimes.
At low energies, the roughly linear increase of tempera-
ture characterizes the condensed phases as solidlike and
liquidlike. For the sodium and, to a lesser extent, for the
LJ cluster, a small inﬂection marks the onset of melt-
ing. At high energies, the cluster temperature drops and
reaches a plateau. The plateau temperature is lower and
the change between the two regimes is sharper as the
waiting time increases. This behavior is consistent with
the observed smaller average cluster size, and results from
a stronger evaporative cooling. In the cluster of fullerene
molecules, no evidence for the melting transition is seen
on the caloric curves, in agreement with the lack of sta-
bility of the liquid phase known in bulk C60 [18]. The
backbending seen for the shortest waiting time (0.5 ns)
was conﬁrmed by another set of 100 independent MD
trajectories. However, without any container preventing
dissociation, it is hard to attribute this feature to melting

or to boiling. The binary LJ cluster was constructed as
a two-layer icosahedron, with the most strongly bound
atoms X in the center. Provided that the waiting time is
long enough, X atoms may dissociate, but only after the
Y atoms have evaporated. The fragmentation of X atoms
is shown on the caloric curve corresponding to t = 10 ns
by the slight increase at high excitation energies.

The time-dependence of fragmentation caloric curves
can also be calculated from simple cluster models, sim-
ilar to those introduced by Bixon and Jortner for the
isomerization problem [19]. Our ﬁrst assumption is that
clusters are heated adiabatically, allowing fragmentation
to occur through sequential loss of monomers [20]. We
use simple rate theories to describe each dissociation
step. The dissociation rate kn(En) of cluster Xn into
Xn−1 depends on the dissociation energy ∆n and the
total energy En through the harmonic RRK approach
∆n/En)3n−6. This well
[21], namely kn(En) = ν0(1
known formula contains a single time scale parameter
ν0, related to the typical vibrational period. Once evap-
oration has occured, the cluster loses a part of its in-
ternal energy, which is described more accurately us-

The problem can be further simpliﬁed by assuming
that the lifetime of the parent cluster is 1/kn and that
evaporative cooling removes the average KER

Beyond this approximate treatment, the kinetic Monte

temperatures do not vary much.

The kinetic Monte Carlo method can be used in more
general situations, for which the rate equation approach
is not practical. Clusters with competing fragmentation
channels turn into products having diﬀerent internal en-
ergies depending on their history. For instance, hetero-
geneous clusters XnYp can dissociate in multiple ways:

Xn−1Yp or from XnYp−1. For the above example, and

By mimicking the actual dissociation cascade followed
by each individual cluster, the KMC technique oﬀers a re-
alistic statistical description of multifragmentation. The
caloric curves of model binary clusters XnY100−n were
calculated assuming that X and Y atoms are bound to
the clusters by the energies ∆X = 1 and ∆Y = 1/2, re-
spectively. The caloric curves represented in Fig. 3(a) for
several compositions exhibit two steps, each associated
with the boiling of Y, then X particles. This two-step
liquid-gas transition is somewhat similar to the multi-
step melting process often seen in cluster simulations [25].
As more Y atoms are added, a larger energy is required
to evaporate them, therefore the gas transition of the
remaining X cluster is initiated at higher temperatures.
The diﬀerent onsets of boiling for X and Y particles in
Fig. 1(c) and (d) conﬁrm this two-step transition.

We now address possible deﬁnitions of the boiling tem-
perature, based on the previous results. The onset of the
drop in the slope of the caloric curve provides one possible
estimate. However, especially at short waiting times, the
variations of the average remaining cluster size seem to
be more reliable. Another observable consists of looking
at the kinetic energy of the evaporated atoms, in a fash-
ion somewhat more closely related to experimental con-
ditions. Using the same notation as above for the initial
and ﬁnal cluster sizes and energies, and assuming that all
k evaporated atoms behave like a perfect gas, a gas

The variations of the average gas temperature across
the boiling transition are shown in Fig. 3(d) for the model
binary clusters. Boiling is made evident by the sudden
increase of the gas temperature, which provides us with
another characterization of the liquid-gas point. The sec-
ond boiling point involving the more strongly bound X
atoms does not lead to signiﬁcant variations of the gas
temperature, because X and Y atoms contribute equally
once in the gas phase. A better estimate of the liquid-gas
transition temperature of the cluster of X atoms is found
with the variations of its ﬁnal size [see Fig. 1(d)].

covered by our simple models. The dependence of the
observation time on the boiling temperature of the ho-
mogeneous cluster is represented in Fig. 4. As expected,
waiting longer favors evaporation, hence a lower boiling
temperature. In most experiments [1, 2, 3, 4] the waiting
time is at least 5 orders of magnitude larger than the typ-
ical vibrational period. Fig. 4 suggests that the results of
these experiments should remain stable by less than 5%
if the waiting time is doubled or halved. However, similar
measurements on trapped clusters might show some de-
viation since the trapping time may exceed seconds [26].
In Fig. 4 we also show how the presence of more weakly
bound (Y) atoms inﬂuence the boiling point of an (X)
cluster. The fragmentation temperature of Y atoms does
not signiﬁcantly change with their initial composition.
However, as more Y atoms are added, the X product gets
progressively colder due to the more numerous evapora-
tions. This explains why the boiling temperature of the
X cluster decreases with its composition.

The KMC technique outlined in this paper could be
improved using more accurate unimolecular rate theo-
ries, such as Phase Space Theory, which incorporates an-
harmonic densities of states as well as a rigorous treat-
ment of angular momentum constraints [15]. The main
assumption of the present approach is that boiling in
slowly heated clusters occurs sequentially. Our simu-
lation results seem to validate this hypothesis. As in
glasses [27], the arbitrarily long time scales reached by
the present statistical approach make it a useful alterna-
tive to molecular dynamics. We believe that it forms a
bridge between unimolecular rate descriptions and multi-
fragmentation models that assume thermal equilibrium.
As a ﬁrst application of the KMC method to the clus-
ter dissociation problem, we have considered the liquid-
gas transition. Our results emphasize the important role
played by the observation time on the caloric curves.

They also indicate that multiple-step boiling transitions
could be detected in heterogeneous clusters. Beyond
these examples, a more complete interpretation of recent
experiments [1, 2, 3], especially on clusters exhibiting
competing dissociation channels [4], could be anticipated.

Prismane C8: a new form of carbon?

Our numerical calculations on small carbon clusters point to the existence of a metastable three-
dimensional eight-atom cluster C8 which has a shape of a six-atom triangular prism with two excess
atoms above and below its bases. We gave this cluster the name ”prismane”. The binding energy of
the prismane equals to 5.1 eV/atom, i.e., is 0.45 eV/atom lower than the binding energy of the stable
one-dimensional eight-atom cluster and 2.3 eV/atom lower than the binding energy of the bulk graphite
or diamond. Molecular dynamics simulations give evidence for a rather high stability of the prismane, the
activation energy for a prismane decay being about 0.8 eV. The prismane lifetime increases rapidly as the
temperature decreases indicating a possibility of experimental observation of this cluster.

Carbon is known to form a rich variety of crystal structures due to its ability to exist in diﬀerent valence states.
As a result, coordination numbers in carbon compounds range from two (e.g. carbyne), through three (e.g. graphite)
to four (e.g. diamond), while typical (”favorable”) values of angles between covalent bonds are 180o in carbyne, 120o
within graphite layers, and 109o28′ in diamond. Recent discovery of the C60 molecule [1] and synthesis of C60 clusters
in macroscopic quantities [2] have stimulated a renewed interest in carbon nanostructures [3]. A carbon nanostructure
may be viewed as a graphite layer transformed into a tube (nanotube), a ball (fulleren) etc, with an exception that
such nanostructures usually comprise pentagons along with hexagons.

A discovery of the cubane C8H8 [4] appeared to be very important from a fundamental viewpoint since the carbon
atoms in the molecule C8H8 are located in the apexes of a cube, so that the angles between C-C bonds equal to 90o,
in contrast to the majority of carbon compounds. As a consequence of ”energetically unfavorable” bond angles, the
molecule C8H8 is metastable and accumulates a considerable amount of energy [4]. Its cubic structure is stabilized by
the corner hydrogen atoms. This rises the question as to whether there exist stable or metastable three-dimensional
clusters that are composed of carbon atoms only and have 90o bond angles.

Another interesting question discussed in the literature [5–8] is ”What is the minimum number of atoms in stable
and metastable three-dimensional carbon clusters?”. It must be emphasized that while there is a substantial progress
in studies of relatively large carbon nanoparticles CN composed of N ∼ 100 carbon atoms [3], the controversy still
remains concerning the structure and energetics of small carbon clusters with N ∼ 10, e.g., whether the stable C4, C6,
and C8 clusters are cyclic or linear [5]. Three-dimensional carbon clusters (cages) are believed to be stable for N ≥ 20
only [6–8], while for clusters with N < 20 the stable structures are one-dimensional linear chains or monocyclic rings
[5–7]. A characteristic feature of small carbon clusters is the existence of metastable states whose binding energies
are lower than the binding energy of the stable cluster with the same N . For N < 14, the metastable structures are
either one-dimensional (chains and rings) or two-dimensional (graphite ﬂakes), see, e.g., Ref. [6]. To our knowledge,
up to now there was no experimental and theoretical evidence for neither stable nor metastable three-dimensional
carbon clusters with N < 14 (the occurrence of metastable cage C14 has been reported in Ref. [8] based on the results
of density functional calculations).

The purpose of this work was to search for metastable three-dimensional clusters CN with N < 14 by means of
numerical simulation. One of such clusters, the cluster C8, was found. Here we report the numerically calculated
structural and energetical characteristics of this cluster whose lifetime appears to be surprisingly long due to rather
high value of its activation energy, about 0.8 eV.

We have carried out TBMD (tight-binding molecular dynamics) simulations of small carbon clusters making use
of a transferable tight-binding potential recently developed for carbon by Xu et al. [7,9]. This numerical technique
allows one to calculate the total energy of the cluster having an arbitrary atomic conﬁguration. It had been proven to
reproduce accurately the energy-versus-volume diagram of carbon polytypes and to give a good description of both
small clusters and bulk structures of carbon [7,9]. We have checked that this technique describes the structure and
energetics of small carbon clusters quite well, the diﬀerence in bond lengths and binding energies between our results
and available ab initio calculations [5] usually did not exceed 10%.

The binding (cohesive) energy Ecoh(N ) of N -atom cluster CN has been determined as (see, e.g., [6])

Ecoh(N ) = N E(1) − E(N ),

(1)

1

where E(N ) is the total energy of the cluster, E(1) is the energy of an isolated carbon atom. The positive value of
Ecoh points to the stability of the cluster with respect to its fragmentation into N carbon atoms. At a given N , there
may exist several atomic conﬁgurations having Ecoh > 0. The cluster with the highest value of Ecoh is stable while
the clusters with lower (but positive) values of Ecoh are metastable. A metastable cluster can transform to the stable,
energetically favorable conﬁguration. A characteristic time of such a process (the lifetime τ ) depends on the height
of the energy barrier separating the metastable and stable conﬁgurations.

We have thoroughly analyzed a number of atomic conﬁgurations as possible candidates to metastable three-
dimensional carbon structures. However, all of them (with one exception that constitutes the essence of this paper, see
below) appeared to be unstable and transformed to one-dimensional clusters or decayed into small fragments even at
T → 0. In particular, we have checked for a possibility of existence of a three-dimensional cluster C8 having the cubic
structure (by analogy with the cubane C8H8 [4]), but we have found that such a cluster is unstable. Nevertheless, we
have discovered that the eight-atom cluster C8 can exist as a three-dimensional cluster having a shape of a six-atom
triangular prism with two excess top atoms above and below its bases. We gave this cluster the name ”prismane”. It
is shown in Fig. 1.

The binding energy of the prismane equals to Ecoh(8)/8 = 5.1 eV/atom. This is 0.45 eV/atom lower than the
binding energy of the stable one-dimensional eight-atom cluster and 2.3 eV/atom lower than the binding energy of
the bulk graphite or diamond. Hence, the prismane C8 is metastable. The lengths of C-C bonds equal to 2.31 ˚A
within each base, 1.28 ˚A between the two bases, and 1.47 ˚A between each base and the nearest top atom, see Fig. 1.
We note that the angles between C-C bonds within the bases and C-C bonds connecting the bases are equal to 90o.
This is one reason for a lower value of the binding energy of the prismane relative to the binding energy of the stable
one-dimensional eight-atom cluster. Meanwhile, the angles between C-C bonds connecting the top atoms with bases
of the prism equal to 104o, being close to the value of bond angle in bulk diamond (109o28′).

In order to determine the energy barrier separating the metastable prismane structure and the stable chain structure,
we have carried out the molecular dynamics simulations of the prismane decay for diﬀerent values of the initial
temperature Tini. The time of one molecular dynamics step constituted t0 = 2.72 · 10−16 s, about one percent of
oscillation period of the dimer C2. The temperature T of the cluster was calculated after each 500 molecular dynamics
steps according to the formula

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, hEkini is the kinetic energy per atom averaged over a period of time ∆t = 500t0.
Such a time averaging enables one to avoid strong ﬂuctuations of T stemming from the small number of atoms in the
cluster under investigation. The initial temperature Tini was determined from Eq. (2) at 0 ≤ t ≤ 500t0.

On general grounds, one would expect the probability of the cluster decay in a unit of time, W , to be given by a

statistical formula

where the factor W0 has dimensionality s−1, and Ea is the activation energy, i.e., the height of the energy barrier
separating the given metastable state from the stable or some other metastable state of the cluster. The cluster
lifetime τ may be deﬁned as

where τ0 = 1/W0. Molecular dynamics simulations allow one to determine the lifetime τ directly at any particular
value of Tini as the time of cluster decay into another atomic conﬁguration. It is convenient to go from the cluster
lifetime τ to a critical number of molecular dynamics steps Nc = τ /t0 which it takes for the cluster to decay:

where N0 = τ0/t0.

Figure 2 shows a typical example of the binding energy per atom, Ecoh(8)/8, and the temperature T of the prismane
as functions of the number of molecular dynamics steps N for the case Tini = 950 K. One can see that Ecoh(8)/8
and T ﬂuctuate near the values 5.0 eV/atom and 950 K respectively over N ≈ 23500 molecular dynamics steps. The
prismane preserves its form during this period of time. At Nc = 23600 ± 100 the prismane decays into the stable
eight-atom chain. The temperature rises up to 2600 K. Strong oscillation of the atoms within the chain with respect to

one another brings about the variation of Ecoh(8)/8 in time from 4.9 eV/atom up to the binding energy of equilibrium
chain, 5.55 eV/atom.

Note however that the lifetime τ = Nct0 = 6.4·10−12 s is rather short on a macroscopic scale, while we are interested
in phenomena which happen on time scales of seconds or even months and years. According to Eq. (4), such long
lifetimes are expected for temperatures much lower than the value Tini = 950 K used in simulations shown in Fig. 2.
But those lifetimes are impossible to achieve by means of direct computer simulations.

To overcome the problem, we have calculated numerically the critical values of Nc for several values of Tini and
ﬁtted the numerical data by Eq. (5). The results are shown in Fig. 3. We stress that the process of cluster decay is
probabilistic in nature. Hence, the lifetime τ is not uniquely determined at a given value of Tini. As a result, the data
for ln(Nc) as a function of 1/Tini are somewhat scattered, see Fig. 3. Nevertheless one can see that the numerical
data can be well ﬁtted by a straight line over rather wide ranges of Nc = 300 ÷ 206000 and Tini = 890 ÷ 1700 K values,
in accordance with Eq. (5). The coeﬃcients of this ﬁt give the values of N0 = 2.1 and Ea/kB = 9500 K in Eq. (5).

We note that the activation energy Ea = 0.82 eV is very large, thus resulting in relatively high stability of the
prismane. Indeed, since the dependence of τ on Tini is exponentially strong, a decrease in Tini leads to a rapid increase
in τ , so that τ ∼ 10µs at Tini = 400 K. An important remark is in order here. Since the total energy of the cluster is
conserved in our simulations, the cluster is unable to decay if the maximum attainable (at a given value of Tini) kinetic
energy Emax
kin is twice the time-averaged kinetic energy at the initial
stage of cluster evolution, i.e., Emax
2 kBTini = 24kBTini, see Eq. (2). Hence, at Tini < Ea/24kB ≈ 400K the
lifetime of the cluster equals to inﬁnity. Thus, in general, an extrapolation of τ (Tini) curve to the range Tini < 400K
is incorrect.

kin of the cluster is less than Ea. In its turn, Emax

kin = 2 · 8 · 3

The lifetime τ is extremely sensitive to the value of the activation energy Ea since the latter appears in the exponent,
see Eq. (4). Hence, even a minor change in Ea will result in a substantial variation of τ at a given Tini. In order to
reﬁne the value of Ea it is necessary to calculate the critical values of Nc for a greater number of initial temperatures
Tini. However, we believe it is unlikely that such a reﬁnement will cause the value of Ea to change signiﬁcantly.

Finally, it should be stressed that we have conﬁrmed the existence of the three-dimensional metastable prismane
structure by making use of other computer codes, e.g., MOPAC and that based on the empirical interatomic potential
proposed for carbon systems by Tersoﬀ [10]. The overall shape of the cluster (Fig. 1) appeared to be the same,
while the bond lengths and the binding energy were to some extent diﬀerent. So, the prismane C8 certainly is not
just an artifact of a speciﬁc simulation technique used in this study, while the values of the prismane binding energy,
activation energy, and lifetimes at diﬀerent temperatures may be reﬁned by means of more sophisticated calculations.
In conclusion, we have predicted the existence of a three-dimensional cluster C8 (prismane) which is the smallest
three-dimensional carbon cluster found so far experimentally or theoretically. This cluster appears to be metastable
and has the binding energy 0.45 eV/atom below the binding energy of the stable one-dimensional eight-atom cluster.
However, molecular dynamics simulations point to a rather high stability of the prismane suggesting that this cluster
may be observed experimentally.

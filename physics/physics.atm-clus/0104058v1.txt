Stability of recently predicted cage-like carbon cluster C8 (prismane)

against its transformations to structures lying at lower energies is studied

theoretically. The smallest energy barrier inhibiting prismane transfor-

mation is shown to be 0.44 eV, in qualitative agreement with the value of

activation energy for prismane decay calculated by molecular dynamics

simulations. A rather high value of the barrier suggests the possibility

of experimental observation of this cluster at ambient pressure.

1. Introduction

Since fullerenes C60 have been discovered [1] and synthesized in macroscopic quan-

tities [2], there is a growing interest in carbon clusters and nanostructures [3, 4, 5].

This interest has both fundamental and applied aspects. On the one hand, small

carbon clusters composed of N ∼ 10 − 100 atoms diﬀer from macroscopic samples

(and even from nanoparticles composed of N ∼ 104 − 105 atoms) in that there are

no ”inner” atoms in such clusters, i.e. all atoms constituting the cluster lie on its

”surface”. A principal impossibility to subdivide interatomic bonding into bulk and

surface parts results in essentially new physics and makes small clusters extremely

interesting objects for basic research [6, 7]. On the other hand, some unusual prop-

erties of small carbon clusters can be used for practical purposes. For example,

1

metastable cubane C8H8 is considered as a high-energy-density material that can

store a considerable amount of energy [6]; there is a hope that doping of C36 fullerene

can result in its phase transition to a superconducting state with an anomalously

high critical temperature Tc enhanced over the alkali-intercalated C60 compounds

[8], etc.

In order the small clusters could form bulk structures by means of interclus-

ter bonding, they should be three-dimensional. Three-dimensional carbon clusters

(cages) are believed to be stable for N ≥ 20 only [9, 10, 11], while for clusters with

N < 20 the stable structures are either one-dimensional (chains) or two-dimensional

(rings) [7, 9, 11]. However, for N < 20, carbon clusters can exist in three-dimensional

metastable states whose binding energies are higher than the binding energy of the

stable cluster with the same N (for example, the occurrence of a metastable C14

cage has been reported in Ref. [10], based on the results of density functional cal-

culations).

Several cage-like metastable isomers C8 have been proposed in Refs. [12, 13, 14]

using the Harris-functional approximation combined with a generalized-gradient ap-

proximation [12], the local spin density and gradient-corrected approximations to

the exchange-correlation energy [13] as well as the trasferable tight-binding potential

[14]. As far as we know, eight-atom isomers have not been observed experimentally

yet, they are the smallest three-dimensional carbon clusters found so far theoreti-

cally. The key issue for a possibility of experimental observation of such clusters

is their relative stability. Note, however, that the stability of isomers C8 have not

been quantiﬁed in refs. [12, 13], e.g., the transformations to structures lying at lower

energies have not been studied. Meanwhile, the results of ab initio calculations are

known to depend strongly on the way that electron correlations are treated [7, 13],

2

and hence a conclusion about the cluster metastability may appear to be just an

artifact of approximations used.

Recently we have predicted [14] the existence of an eight-atom metastable cage-

like cluster C8 that has the shape of a six-atom triangular prism with two excess

atoms above and below its bases. We gave this cluster the name ”prismane”. It

is shown in Fig.1. The binding energy of prismane is 0.45 eV/atom higher than

the binding energy of the stable one-dimensional eight-atom cluster shown in Fig.2.

Nevertheless, molecular dynamics simulations gave evidence for a relatively high

stability of prismane, the activation energy for prismane decay was estimated to

be about 1 eV [14], suggesting that prismane lifetime is rather long and that this

cluster may be observed experimentally.

However, although the ﬁnite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations provide

the most direct way for evaluation of the cluster lifetime, such calculations are ex-

tremely time-consuming since the process of cluster decay is probabilistic in nature,

and hence a huge statistics should be accumulated in order to draw a deﬁnite con-

clusion about the values of the cluster lifetime and activation energy. Alternatively,

useful complementary information concerning characteristics of the metastable state

can be provided by calculations of the heights of energy barriers inhibiting sponta-

neous transformation of the cluster to the lower-energy atomic conﬁguration. Such

calculations have been carried out, e.g., to study the atmospheric-pressure stability

of energetic phases of carbon [15] and polymeric nitrogen [16]. It was the purpose of

this work to ﬁnd the minimum energy barrier separating the metastable prismane

structure C8 shown in Fig.1 from the stable chain structure in order to see if such a

cluster can be observed experimentally at non-exotic conditions.

2. Computational details

To calculate the binding energy of a cluster having an arbitrary atomic conﬁgu-

ration, we have used a transferable tight-binding potential [11, 17] that had been

proven to reproduce accurately the energy-versus-volume diagram of carbon poly-

types and to give a good description of both small clusters and bulk structures of

carbon [11, 17]. On the one hand, this potential describes the structure and ener-

getics of small carbon clusters quite well, the diﬀerence in bond lengths and binding

energies between our results and available ab initio calculations [7] usually did not

exceed 10%. On the other hand, the technique used greatly simpliﬁes a reliable eval-

uation of characteristics of metastable states as compared with ab initio approaches

[18, 19].

The search for the minimum energy barrier separating two locally stable atomic

conﬁgurations is equivalent to the search for a saddle point in the total-energy sur-

face as a function of the atomic coordinates. Such a saddle point corresponds to the

unstable conﬁguration of atoms in the cluster. The algorithm of the search for a sad-

dle point is based on a continuous transformation of the cluster along the directions

of atomic motion in the softest oscillation mode of the cluster, i.e. the mode with

the minimum oscillation frequency. This algorithm is analogous to the ”soft-mode

walking” procedure [20] in which the information regarding both gradients and Hes-

sian (energy curvatures) is used to systematically proceed up the bottom of a valley

(local minimum) to a transition (saddle) state. In uphill walks from the minimum-

energy geometry of the cluster to the transition state, the energy is maximized in

the soft-mode direction and minimized in all orthogonal directions, thereby forcing

the walk to be in a stream bed [20]. Apart from the eﬃcient search for a saddle

point, such an algorithm gives the energy spectrum of mechanical oscillations of the

4

cluster. The knowledge of this spectrum allows for a reliable discrimination between

the metastable and long-living unstable states of the cluster (sometimes this cannot

be done by means of molecular dynamics simulations).

All calculations were carried out at pressure P = 0, i.e.

in fact at ambient

(atmospheric) pressure [16].

3. Results and discussion

We deﬁne the binding energy Eb of a C8 cluster as

Eb = E(8) − 8E(1),

(1)

i.e. as the diﬀerence between the total energy of the cluster, E(8), and the energy

8E(1) of eight isolated carbon atoms. The binding energy of the metastable prismane

(P) is EP

b = −40.80 eV. The binding energy of the stable eight-atom chain (C) is

EC

b = −44.37 eV.

Starting with the prismane structure, we ﬁrst computed the energy spectrum of

its mechanical oscillations. We have found that all oscillation frequencies are real,

giving evidence that the prismane structure corresponds to a local minimum in the

total-energy surface as a function of the atomic coordinates, i.e. the prismane is

indeed a metastable cluster.

We now consider the energetics associated with the prismane transformation to

the stable chain conﬁguration in the soft-mode direction. Fig.3 shows the diﬀerence

∆Eb = Eb − EC

b between the binding energy of the transformed C8 cluster, Eb, and

EC

b versus the generalized transformation coordinate R deﬁned as a mean square

deviation of atomic coordinates xi, yi, zi of the transformed cluster from their cor-

responding values xi0, yi0, zi0 in the prismane structure (i = 1 − 8 is the number of

5

atom in the cluster):

R2 =

[(xi − xi0)2 + (yi − yi0)2 + (zi − zi0)2].

i=1

One can see that the function ∆Eb(R) has a local minimum at R = 0 corresponding

to the metastable prismane structure. The value of ∆Eb(R) increases with R and

passes through the maximum S1 at R ≈ 0.5 ˚A. This maximum corresponds to

the unstable conﬁguration ”scorpion” shown in Fig.4. The binding energy of the

”scorpion” is ES1

b = −40.36 eV, so that the energy barrier inhibiting spontaneous

prismane transformation to the lower-energy atomic conﬁguration appears to be

U = ES1

b − EP

b = 0.44 eV.

We have found (see Fig.3) that further increase in R leads to the prismane trans-

formation at R ≈ 6.5 ˚A not into the stable eight-atom chain (as one could expect)

but into another metastable conﬁguration ”frying pan” (FP) shown in Fig.5. This

conﬁguration corresponds to the local minimum in the total-energy surface. The

binding energy of the ”frying pan” EF P

b = −42.85 eV is 2.05 eV below the binding

energy EP

b of the prismane but 1.52 eV higher than that of the stable chain, EC
b .

Next we have studied the transformation path of the ”frying pan” in its soft-

mode direction. Fig.6 shows the value of ∆Eb = Eb − EC

b as a function of the

transformation coordinate R deﬁned by Eq.(2), where xi0, yi0, zi0 are now the atomic

coordinates of the ”frying pan”. One can see that ∆Eb(R) ﬁrst increases with R,

passes through the maximum S2 at R ≈ 2.7 ˚A and then decreases down to zero

at R ≈ 6 ˚A, so that the stable chain structure (see Fig.2) is ﬁnally reached. The

maximum of ∆Eb(R) corresponds to the unstable conﬁguration shown in Fig.7. The

binding energy of this conﬁguration is ES2

b = −42.08 eV, so that the energy barrier

inhibiting the ”frying pan” transformation to the linear chain is equal to U1 =

ES2

b − EF P

b = 0.77 eV. Hence, the prismane transformation into the stable eight-

6

atom chain is a two-step process that takes place via an ”intermediary” metastable

conﬁguration ”frying pan”.

Note that there also exist the paths of prismane transformation other than that

shown in Figs. 3 and 6. The latter, however, is characterized by the smallest energy

barrier U inhibiting transformation of the prismane structure to the lower-energy

conﬁgurations. It is the path with the smallest barrier that is key to the issue of

metastability.

We stress that the data of ﬁnite-temperature molecular-dynamics simulation [14]

are consistent with the results presented above. For all temperatures studied, 800 K

< T < 1800 K, the prismane ﬁrst transforms to the ”frying pan” conﬁguration, and

next to the linear chain. The activation energy Ea = 0.82 eV for prismane decay

estimated in [14] on the basis of the temperature dependence of prismane lifetime

is about twice the height of the smallest energy barrier U = 0.44 eV calculated in

this work. Note, however, that the cluster lifetime depends, in general, on the full

topology of the total-energy surface, beyond just the minimum energy barrier.

4. Conclusions

We have numerically examined the metastability of recently predicted cage-like

carbon cluster prismane C8. It was demonstrated that the minimum energy bar-

rier separating the prismane structure from the lower-energy atomic conﬁguration

amounts to 0.44 eV. Combined with the data on ﬁnite-temperature molecular-

dynamics simulation of prismane decay, our result points to rather long lifetime

of the prismane in its metastable state, suggesting the possibility of experimental

synthesis of this cluster.

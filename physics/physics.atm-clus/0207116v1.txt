We revisit a model in which the ionization energy of a metal particle is associated with the work
done by the image charge force in moving the electron from inﬁnity to a small cut-oﬀ distance just
outside the surface. We show that this model can be compactly, and productively, employed to
study the size dependence of electron removal energies over the range encompassing bulk surfaces,
ﬁnite clusters, and individual atoms. It accounts in a straightforward manner for the empirically
known correlation between the atomic ionization potential (IP) and the metal work function (WF),
IP/WF∼2. We formulate simple expressions for the model parameters, requiring only a single prop-
erty (the atomic polarizability or the nearest neighbor distance) as input. Without any additional
adjustable parameters, the model yields both the IP and the WF within ∼10% for all metallic
elements, as well as matches the size evolution of the ionization potentials of ﬁnite metal clusters
for a large fraction of the experimental data. The parametrization takes advantage of a remarkably
constant numerical correlation between the nearest-neighbor distance in a crystal, the cube root of
the atomic polarizability, and the image force cutoﬀ length. The paper also includes an analytical
derivation of the relation of the outer radius of a cluster of close-packed spheres to its geometric
structure.

I.

INTRODUCTION

While the good agreement between theoretical and ex-
perimental atomic ionization potentials (IP) is a ma-
jor triumph for quantum mechanics, it is prohibitively
more diﬃcult to rigourously solve the polyatomic quan-
tum problem, not to mention extrapolation to an inﬁnite
bulk metal. The IP for an atom is a well understood
quantity. The same cannot, however, be said about the
work function (WF) for a metal or even for a ﬁnite clus-
ter. On the other hand, it is an experimentally realistic
task to produce clusters ranging in size from two atoms
up to tens of thousands of atoms and to measure the size
dependence of the electron removal energy. The clusters
can be made big enough that they can be considered close
to bulk metals, hence the evolution from the atomic IP
to the metal WF can be mapped out. Experiments over
such a wide range have been performed, e.g., for sodium1.
For each element in the periodic table one would therefore
expect that there exists a function which can predict the
electron removal energy for a particle of arbitrary size.

The exact derivation of such a scaling law is a daunting
task. However, the available experimental data on the
IP, the WF, and on clusters reveal some characteristic
features. For example, it has been noted a long time
ago that the IP and the WF of metallic elements are
approximately correlated to each other via the factor2,3

for many metal clusters of intermediate sizes. To give
another example, the electron removal energy has been
found to scale as

I/W

where R is the radius of the cluster and γ is a constant
factor4,5. Henceforth, I will denote the atomic ﬁrst ion-
ization potential, W will denote the polycristalline bulk
surface work function, and for a ﬁnite metal particle the
term ”electron removal energy” will be employed (de-
noted by φ).

Despite the continual increase in computational power,
quantitative ﬁrst-principles calculations of the WF for
the elements have not succeeded in obtaining a better ac-
curacy than simple models based on semi-empirical ap-
proaches combined with classical electrostatics6. This
strongly suggests that some features of the desired scal-
ing law may be found by employing such an approach. In
this paper we demonstrate that by combining the image-
charge potential function for a ﬁnite particle with just
a single material-dependent scale parameter (the atomic
polarizability α or the crystalline nearest-neighbor dis-
tance rnn) one can obtain an interpolation formula cov-
ering the full size range from the atom through the cluster
to the bulk. This formula estimates both the IP and the
WF within
10% for all metallic elements in the periodic
table, yields values in reasonable agreement with experi-
ment for many intermediate sized clusters, and provides
a natural justiﬁcation for the aforementioned IP/WF
2
ratio.

In Sec.

The plan of the paper is as follows.

II we
consider the image-charge expression which describes the
removal of an electron from an isolated sphere. By focus-
ing on the limits of a sphere of atomic radius and one of
inﬁnite radius, we show that the relation (1) follows as
naturally from the image-charge consideration as does
Eq. (2). In Sec. III we demonstrate some striking paral-
lels between the variation of atomic sizes and image-force
cutoﬀ distances across the periodic table and use these
observations to formulate compact expressions for esti-

mating both WF and IP. We show that by using an ap-
propriately interpolated expression for the cluster radius
a good description of the size evolution of cluster ioniza-
tion potentials can be obtained. Some rigorous formulas
on close-packed cluster radii are derived in the Appendix.

It is stated in the literature that the earliest attempt
to explain the work function of a metallic surface using
classical electrostatics was due to Debye7. He proposed
that it is equal to the energy required to pull an elec-
tron out to inﬁnity against its image charge. Since the
image force diverges at the surface, Schottky8 suggested
that one may be able to deﬁne a microscopic cutoﬀ dis-
tance d at which the image force starts to act. Despite
the simplicity of this model9, there have been numerous
attempts to estimate the parameter d in order to ﬁt the
experimental values of the WF2,3,6,10,11,12. Although the
particular choices of d were supported only by plausibil-
ity arguments, they were frequently able to oﬀer rather
nice agreement with the experimental data.

In a similar spirit, let us now consider the image-force
expression for the energy required to remove an electron
from an isolated ﬁnite metal particle, modelled as a con-
ducting sphere of radius R. The particle is assumed ini-
tially neutral, i.e., after the removal of the electron it ac-
quires an unit positive charge. A calculation of the work
required to move the electron from a distance d outside
the metal surface to inﬁnity against its image charge is a
straightforward exercise13:

φ(R) =

e2
4d (cid:18)

1 + 4(d/R) + 6(d/R)2 + 2(d/R)3
(1 + d/2R)(1 + d/R)2

.

(cid:19)

(3)

The cutoﬀ parameter d is assumed to be a material-
dependent constant. The ﬁrst factor on the right-hand
side represents the bulk (R
) work function: W =
e2/(4d). This formula has been applied to yttrium and
lanthanide clusters in Ref.
[14]. However, the authors
did not extend it to the bulk or the atomic limit; they
used the equation as an extrapolation formula for small
clusters with the WF as a given boundary condition.

→ ∞

It is convenient to rewrite the above equation in the

following form:

φ(R)
W

= η(d/R),

(4)

where the dimensionless scaling function η(d/R) is de-
ﬁned by the second factor in Eq. (3) and plotted in Fig.
1. If Eq. (4) were applied all the way down to the atomic
limit, it would give an estimate of the ratio IP/WF as the
value of η(d/Rat), where Rat is a quantity characterizing
the atomic size. On the other hand, we know from numer-
ous investigations2,3,6,10,11,12 that the cutoﬀ parameter d
is, sensibly enough, also of the same order of magnitude.
In the atomic limit, therefore, the ratio d/Rat should be

This is a new explanation of the well known empirical
result mentioned in the Introduction, Eq.

of the variables d and Rat and show that these can give
an even more accurate value of the IP/WF ratio.

In the large R limit, the scaling function can be ex-

panded to ﬁrst order in d/R. The result is:

This is the well known ﬁnite size correction for the ion-
ization potential of metallic clusters4,5,15,16,17. This scal-
ing law has been experimentally veriﬁed for many metal
clusters4,5,17,18. Although there is still some controversy
whether the 3/8 factor is suﬃciently rigorous19,20,21,22,23,
Eq. (6) does ﬁt the experimental data relatively well.

It appears, therefore, that Eq. (3) oﬀers a consistent
estimate for the scaling of electron removal energy from
the atomic IP to ﬁnite particle sizes to the bulk WF. It is
interesting to ask whether some simple parametrizations
for the image force cutoﬀ distance and atomic and cluster
radii may be proposed so as to enable more quantitative
applications of Eq. (3) to experimental data. This is the
subject of the sections that follow.

III. LENGTH SCALE PARAMETERS

For guidance with length scaling,

let us begin by
plotting the ”experimental” image force cutoﬀ distances
as deﬁned by equating e2/(4d) to the experimentally
measured bulk surface polycrystalline work functions24.
These values are shown in Fig. 2(a). The same ﬁg-

ure displays two quantities reﬂecting the size of individ-
ual atoms: the cube root of the atomic polarizability24
(rα) and one-half of the nearest neighbor distance in a
crystal25 (rnn/2). Although d shows strong correlation
with both the polarizability radius and the nearest neigh-
bor distance, it’s consistently lower than either one. How-
ever, by forming the inverse sum of the two, a quantity
emerges which follows the experimental values of d beau-
tifully. This parametrization has the form

1/d

1/rα + 2/rnn

≈

(7)

and agrees with the empirical value of the cutoﬀ param-
eter to within
10% for most metallic elements, see Fig.
2(b). Put another way, the WF for most metallic ele-
ments can be estimated to better than 10% by using this
parametrization of d.

∼

The coexistence of an atomic part and a bulk part in a
work function model resembles qualitatively the elegant
argument in Ref. [26] in which the WF value is calculated
as arising from the IP of a neutral atom reduced by the
work done by the image force in bringing the resulting
ion back to the crystal surface.

As a matter of fact, Fig. 2(a) reveals that all the size
parameters turn out to have essentially the same trend
across the periodic table, diﬀering only in overall magni-
tude. We are not aware of a quantitative theory explain-
ing this observation, but, roughly speaking, one does ex-
pect bigger atoms to have higher polarizabilities, larger

lattice spacings in crystal form, and lower IP together
with lower WF [via Eqs. (1,5)] and therefore greater d
values27. This strongly suggests that just a single size
parameter may be suﬃcient to yield an estimate for the
WF.

Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3, it turns out that the ratio
rnn/(2rα) is very close to 0.65 for all metallic elements28
(the deviation from this average is within
20%), and
this correlation can be substituted into Eq. (7). In the
end, therefore, one can use, e.g., only the polarizability
radius rα in order to predict the approximate value of
the bulk surface WF.

∼

As shown in Fig. 4, a plot of

W =

∼

i.e., Eq. (7) with rnn/2 = 0.65rα [cf. Fig. 2(c)] conﬁrms
that this single-parameter formula gives WF estimates
10% of the experimental values. As mentioned
within
at the beginning of Sec. II, a variety of expressions for
the quantity d have been proposed earlier, but the one
given here shares the virtues of needing only a single piece
of information (the atomic polarizability or the nearest
neighbor distance), being free of additional adjustable
parameters, and producing rather accurate results.

Returning to the subject of the IP/WF ratio discussed
(5), we notice that even

The discussion in this section shows that a consistent
and economical description of electron removal energies
both in the bulk and the atomic limits can be achieved
with the help of only a single atomic parameter. In the
next section we will consider the region in between, i.e.,
the electron removal energies for clusters of a ﬁnite num-
ber of atoms.

IV. ELECTRON REMOVAL ENERGIES FOR
CLUSTERS AND HARD SPHERE PACKING

Having shown that the scaling law, Eq. (3), oﬀers good
guidance for both IP and WF, we now address the inter-
mediate regime of ﬁnite clusters. Therefore a workable
parametrization of cluster radius, Rcl, is needed for use
in this equation.

A commonly used method to estimate the particle ra-
dius is to scale it according to the Wigner-Seitz radius:
Rcl(N ) = rsN 1/3, where N is the number of atoms. This
expression, commonly augmented with an electron spill-
out term, has been used to describe many cluster proper-
ties. However, if this formula is used in Eq. (3) together
with the expressions for d obtained above, a close match
with the experimental data is not obtained. Moreover, it
is desirable to retain a form that would depend only on
N and on the parameters rα and/or rnn, as in the atomic
and bulk limits described above.

A complementary deﬁnition of cluster radius has been
[14,29]. The cluster was modelled as
proposed in Ref.
a group of hard spheres packed so as to minimize the
surface area. The radius of a sphere circumscribing the
close-packed cluster was then substituted into Eq. (3).
By packing steel balls in a rubber envelope, the authors
found empirically that this circumscribing sphere radius
could be expressed as

Rcl(N )

1.3r0N 1/3

≈

(12)

for clusters N >
7, where r0 is the radius of each in-
∼
dividual hard sphere. For smaller clusters, the exact
circumscribing sphere radius can be derived from sim-
ple geometry14. This deﬁnition gave reasonable answers
for several metal clusters, although additional adjustable
parameters had to be employed. We found that an ex-
pression of the type (12) can be derived analytically for
various cluster packing arrangement. The precise numer-
ical coeﬃcient varies with the packing structure, but in
all cases is not far from 1.3. The analysis is described in
the Appendix.

Based on these considerations, we formulate the fol-
lowing interpolation for the parameter R to be used in
Eq. (3) for the calculation of clusters’ φ(R):

R2

cl(N )
Rcl(N ) + rnn/2

.

R

Here Rcl(N ) is the outer, or circumscribing (as described
above) radius for a cluster with N hard spheres, each of
a radius equal to the polarizability radius r0 = rα. As
before, rnn is the nearest neighbor distance of the bulk

metal . For N
in the atomic limit it is the same as Eq. (11).

In view of the previously discussed relation between the
experimental values of rnn and rα, this equation can be
rewritten purely in terms of the latter quantity. In par-
ticular, for the larger clusters for which Eq. (12) holds,
we obtain

When these expressions are used together with d from
the previous section in Eq. (3) [note that for the small-
est clusters it is important to use the full image-charge
formula rather than the expansion (6)], they succeed in
describing the behavior of a large fraction of elemental
metallic clusters. This is shown in Fig. 6 which compares
the calculated electron removal energies with experimen-
tal results on clusters for which data over a suﬃcient size
range are available. It is not surprising that the cluster
ﬁts are not of uniform quality. Indeed, whereas our aim
has been to reduce as much as possible the number of in-
put parameters, the deﬁnition of cluster size is inherently
not so ”universal.” The geometric structures of clusters
containing up to several hundred atoms are neither con-
stant nor necessarily the same as the bulk limit (see, e.g.,
the reviews in [48,49]), and the bond lengths may gener-
ally vary both with cluster size and from the inner to the
outer layers. As a result, the formulae given in this sec-
tion should be viewed as approximations. Their utility
is in the fact that they provide a sensible interpolation
between the atomic and bulk limits discussed above, and
it is satisfying that a one-parameter expression in many
cases provides not only qualitative but also quantitative
guidance.

V. SUMMARY

5

The main results of this work can be summarized as

follows.

∼

(1) Starting with an expression for the electron removal
energy in terms of the image charge potential for an iso-
lated spherical particle and a surface cutoﬀ parameter
[Eq. 3], we explored how this model may be consistently
applied to metallic systems ranging from bulk surfaces to
ﬁnite clusters and down to individual atoms.

(2) We showed that this approach provides a trans-
parent physical explanation for the empirical fact that
the atomic ionization potentials and polycrystalline work
functions of the metallic elements exhibit an almost con-
stant ratio of

2 over the periodic table [Eqs. (1, 10).

(3) We found that for most elements there is a remark-
ably close numerical correlation between the values of the
nearest-neighbor distance in a crystal, the cube root of
the atomic polarizability, and the image force cutoﬀ pa-
rameter. This correlation may be rationalized qualita-
tively, but appears worthy of further study.

(4) Taking advantage of this correlation, we formulated
simple expressions for the cutoﬀ distance [Eq. (7)] and
the atomic and cluster radii [Eqs. (11,13,14)]. They yield
good estimates for the work function, the ionization po-
tential, and the cluster electron removal energies by using
only a single input parameter, the atomic polarizability.
No extra adjustable parameters are required.

(5) We also provided an analytical derivation of the
connection between the geometric structure of a cluster of
close-packed spheres and its outer radius. It is described
by an equation of the type (12), but the precise numerical
coeﬃcient is shown to depend on the packing structure.

APPENDIX: HARD SPHERE PACKING

There exist well-deﬁned geometries for ﬁnite systems
which provide densely packed structures corresponding to
speciﬁc bulk lattices in the large-size limit. As reviewed
[50,51,52], these structures are
in detail, e.g., in Refs.
best visualized as arising from the packing of spheres.
Some of the commonly encountered ones are illustrated
in Fig. V. Here we derive the outer radii of these
structures as a function of the number of hard spheres,
N . The radius is deﬁned as corresponding to the small-
est sphere which completely encloses (circumscribes) the
cluster made up of N close-packed hard spheres, each
with a radius r0

crete point groups. Although due to it’s ﬁve-fold symme-
try, the icosahedron does not form bulk crystals, it can be
considered as a slightly distorted fcc crystal. The icosa-
hedron structure has been observed for small clusters of
inert-gas clusters, Ca, and Mg clusters (see references
in 51). The relationship between the number of hard
spheres and the number of shells is the same as for the
cube-octahedron51: N = (10/3)k3

The radius is also given by the same expression as for
the cube-octahedron R = (2k

expression for the cluster radius is therefore the same
as for the cube-octahedron. For large k the radius is:

27 We thank Prof. W. A. Harrison for pointing out this fact.
28 Within individual structural families, the average of the
ratio rnn/(2rα) is 0.72 for the fcc metals, 0.66 for the hcp
metals, and 0.61 for the bcc metals.

30 In the limit of large clusters which can be thought of as
bulk crystal fragments, the radii of their circumscribing
spheres should become proportional to rnn rather than rα,
which implies an additional numerical factor in Eq. (13).
However, in the small-cluster limit for which most experi-
mental data are available and for which we are developing
a parametrization, the use of rα gives a better ﬁt. As re-
marked at the end of Sec. IV, this evidently reﬂects the fact
that the small metal clusters, produced in beam sources,
do not necessarily possess the exact bulk geometry.

Time-dependent orientations of two coupled dipole molecules in which one of the molecule is
kicked by periodic laser pulses are studied. The orientations of the unkicked molecule is found to be
induced due to the dipole-dipole interaction. It is also found the entanglement can be established
by the periodic laser pulse. With the increasing of laser intensities, the crossover from periodic to
chaotic orientation is observed. A stable entanglement is still generated even the coupled system is
in irregular orientation. In addition, the degrees of entanglement can be controlled by tuning the
number of laser pulses.

Control of alignment and orientation of molecules is
one of important goals in stereodynamics [1], surface
catalysis [2], trapping molecules [3], molecular focusing
[4], and nanoscale design [5]. Theoretically, a picosecond
laser pulse can create the pendular states, which are hy-
brid of ﬁeld-free molecular eigenstates [6, 7]. By turning
on the laser adiabatically, the pendular states is achieved
and leads to alignment of the molecules.
In addition,
a femtosecond laser pulse, like impulsive excitation, can
generate a ﬁeld-free orientation, which is a nonstation-
ary wave packet [8]. As the ultrashort laser pulse kicks
a molecule, an impulsive momentum is transferred to
the molecule and results in the orientation. Several ex-
periments have been done to control the alignment and
orientation of molecules [9]. Especially, controlling the
orientation of polar molecules based on FH method [10]
had been demonstrated with combined electrostatic and
pulsed nonresonant laser ﬁelds [11].

On the other hand, great attention has been focused
on the entanglement issue recently since generation of
entangled states is one of the fundamental requirements
for quantum information processing[12]. Lots of works
have been associated with quantum-optic and atomic
systems[13]. With the increasing of nano-science technol-
ogy, it is now possible to resolve two individual molecules
separated by 12 nanometers.[14] Motivated by these re-
searches, a diﬀerent way of generating entanglement is
proposed in this Letter. Two molecules with perma-
nent dipole moments are considered to be coupled by
the dipole-dipole interaction. An ultrashort laser pulse
is applied to one of the molecules. It is found that the
orientation behavior can display chaotic feature under
certain conditions. However, a stable entanglement can
still be generated even the coupled dipole moments are
in irregular orientation. Moreover, the entanglement in-
duced by the dipole interaction can be increased to some
degrees by controlling the number of kicking pulses.

In our model, we consider

two identical dipole
molecules separated by a distance of R. The dipole-
dipole interaction is assumed between the molecules.
Laser pulses are applied to one of the coupled molecules

only. The Hamiltonian of the system can be written as

H = −

where Lj is the angular momentum operator and ¯h2

the rotational constant. Udip is the interaction between
two molecules with dipole moments ~µ1 and ~µ2

For simplicity, the dipole moments of two molecules are
assumed to be identical, i.e., µ1 = µ2 = µ. The ﬁeld-
molecule coupling Hl is an electrical-dipole coupling, and
can be expressed as

Hl = −µE (t) cos θ cos (ωt) ,

where θ is the angle between the dipole moment vector
and the laser ﬁeld vector. The laser proﬁle is a Gaussian

shape with E (t) = E0e−
, where E0 is the ﬁeld
strength, t0 is the center of peak, and σ is the pulse
duration. The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is
solved by expanding the wave function in terms of a series
of ﬁeld-free spherical harmonic functions

dependent coeﬃcients corresponding to the quantum
numbers (l, m; l′, m′) and can be determined by solving
the Schr¨odinger equations numerically.

Once the coeﬃcients are determined, the orientations
can be obtained

by the following integrals immediately:

tions of the molecules seems to be oversimpliﬁed, how-
ever, the model described here can be easily extended to
the hindered-rotation problem[15] in which the molecules
are hindered by the surface, and the ﬁeld-free spherical
harmonic functions are replaced by the hypergeometric
functions. The essential physics discussed below should
not be changed.

functions of time under single laser pulse. As one can
note from Fig. 1, the orientations depend strongly on
inter-molecular separation. For inter-molecular separa-
8 m, the behavior of the ﬁrst molecule
tion R= 3 × 10−
is quite close to that of a free rotor [8] as shown in the
upper panel of Fig. 1(a). This is not surprising since
the dipole interaction is weak at this distance [8]. How-
ever, the orientation of the second molecule can still be
induced in this weak limit, and the inter-peak separa-
tion of the orientation is similar to that of the ﬁrst one.
One may also note that the amplitudes of the orienta-
tions are not uniform with time. As shown in Fig. 1 (a),

suppressed while the oscillation of
This phenomenon can be realized as the energy transfer
between two coupled oscillators. As the distance of two
polar molecules is closer (Fig. 1 (b)), the dipole interac-
tion is increased and the energy exchange becomes more
frequently. When the inter-distance between the dipole
moments is decreased further as shown in Fig. 1 (c), the
electric dipole interaction becomes stronger than those
in Figs. 1 (a) and (b). In this situation, both molecules
orient disorderly, and the periodic behavior almost disap-
pears. This indicates that the role of the electric dipole
interaction overwhelms the laser pulse. In this case, the
energy transfer between two molecules is so quick that
the regular orientation caused by the laser pulse is inhib-
ited by the dipole interaction.

increases. Although the popula-
tions of the lower-lying states show periodic behavior, the

Fig. 2), for example the (2,0;1,0) state, display diﬀerent
degrees of irregularity for various distances. The popula-
tions of some higher energy states are also irregular and
not shown here.

The populations of the higher energy states become
larger as the molecular separation is decreased. The ir-
regularity and the population increase of higher energy
states for smaller molecular separation can be understood
as follows. The decrease in molecular separation results
in the increase of the dipole-dipole interaction which in
turn changes the energy levels of the coupled system.
When the laser pulse kicks the ﬁrst molecule, it trans-
fers the momentum to the coupled system and excites
the system to some higher energy states . When the
laser pulse passes away, the system is still aﬀected by
the dipole force which still causes some nonlinear eﬀect
on the transitions to higher energy states. Therefore,
we may conclude the dipole force plays two roles in the
kicking process. First, it modulates the energy exchange
frequency of the lower-lying states. Second, it generates
the irregular populations of the higher energy states and
results in the irregular behavior of hcos θi and
.

Instead of applying single laser pulse, let us now pay
attention to the orientation of two polar molecules un-
der a series of laser pulses, which are applied periodically

to the ﬁrst molecule with a period of 44.3 ps. With a
8 m) between two molecules,
ﬁxed distance (R=2× 10−
we investigate the eﬀect of laser intensity on molecular
orientation. As shown in Fig. 3, the periodic orienta-
tion of the ﬁrst molecule (Fig.3 (a)) gradually changes to
chaotic behavior (Fig. 3 (c)) when laser intensity is in-
creased. However, the orientation of the second molecule
cos θ′
(
) behaves somewhat regularly, and the distance
of the adjacent peaks approaches the result of single laser

pulse. Comparing the results with those of a single pulse
(Fig. 1 (b)), the chaotic behavior of the ﬁrst molecule can
be ascribed to the periodic laser kicks, which is known
as the ”kicked-rotor”problem. The underlying physics is
that whenever a laser pulse kicks the molecule, an im-
pulsive momentum is transferred to the coupled system.
The next kick will excite or refresh the populations of
the quantum states. This makes the orientations become
more complex. When the eﬀect of the laser pulses is
nonlinear, the orientation of the ﬁrst molecule manifests
chaotic behavior. The novel feature here is the unex-
pected orderly behavior of the second molecule. The
reason may be attributed to the soft interaction between

FIG. 3: The orientations of the ﬁrst (black line) and second
(red line) molecule under the periodic laser pulses with the
period T=44.3 ps and intensities E0= (a) 3 × 106 (b) 9 × 106
(c) 3 × 107 V/m.

From physical arguments, it is known that one-photon
absorption is the main contribution to the orientation.
The populations of the excited states should be dis-
tributed mainly on c1000 and c0010. Therefore, it is worth-
while to study in more detail the occupation probabilities
of the singlet state (hΨSi = 1
√2 hY10Y00 − Y00Y10i) and
triplet state (hΨT i = 1
√2 hY10Y00 + Y00Y10i). With the
same periodic laser pulses, the contributions of the sin-
glet and triplet state exhibit a sudden jump-up or down
after every kick (Fig. 4 (a)). This means that the pop-
ulations are redistributed whenever a laser pulse passes
through. In addition, the average occupation probabili-
ties of the entangled states increase with the increasing
of laser intensities, and the degrees of entanglement are
high at certain intervals. To see whether the high degrees
of entanglement are able to be maintained, we stop the
laser pulses after certain number of kicks. With pulse
period T = 88.6 ps and intensity E0 = 3 × 107 V/m, the

high contributions of the singlet state are maintained af-
ter the seventh kick as shown in Fig. 4 (c). In principle
this characteristic may be employed to control the de-
grees of entanglement which is important for the ﬁeld
of quantum information technique. Furthermore, the op-
tima control theory, which are realizable in pulse shaping
experiments[16], may also be used to increase the degrees
of entanglement.[17] One also notes that although the en-
tangled states are periodic as a function of time after the
seventh kick, the orientations of the system still show ir-
regular behavior as shown in the inset of Fig. 4 (c). This
is because the origin of the irregularity comes from the
higher excited states instead of the ﬁrst excited state.

discuss the rotational excited states instead of internal
electronic states of the molecules. Second, the laser fre-
quency in our work is tuned far-oﬀ from resonance, while
conventional creation of entanglement depends on the
resonant driving pulses. This means our results provide
a wider range to choose the laser frequency to create
entanglement. As for the eﬀect of decoherence, the en-
tanglement is formed by the excited rotational states,
not the vibrational states. Therefore, the decoherence is
dominated by photon emission even if the molecules are
attached to the surface of a solid. It has been known that
the singlet (triplet) state undergoes sub-radiant (super-
radiant) emission as the inter-molecular distance is much
smaller than the wavelength of the emitted photon. And
the photon reservoirs even assist the formation of the
singlet entangled state.[18]

In conclusion, we studied the eﬀects of single laser
pulse and dipole interaction on a coupled-molecular sys-
tem with various inter-molecular distances. The ori-
entations are found to behave disorderly as the inter-
molecular separation is decreased. Similar to the case
of ”kicked-rotor”problem, the orientations of the kicked
molecule display the chaotic behavior when the intensi-
ties of the periodic laser pulses are high enough. Further-
more, the nonlinear time dependent entanglement can
be generated by the periodic laser pulses. And the sta-
ble entanglement can still be generated even the coupled
system is in irregular orientation. This feature is inter-
esting and may be useful in future quantum information
processing.

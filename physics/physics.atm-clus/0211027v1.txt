The optimized structure and electronic properties of neutral and singly charged

magnesium clusters have been investigated using ab initio theoretical methods based

on density-functional theory and systematic post-Hartree-Fock many-body pertur-

bation theory accounting for all electrons in the system. We have systematically

calculated the optimized geometries of neutral and singly charged magnesium clus-

ters consisting of up to 21 atoms, electronic shell closures, binding energies per atom,

ionization potentials and the gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoc-

cupied molecular orbitals. We have investigated the transition to the hcp structure

and metallic evolution of the magnesium clusters, as well as the stability of linear

chains and rings of magnesium atoms. The results obtained are compared with the

available experimental data and the results of other theoretical works.

INTRODUCTION

Metal clusters have been recognized as new physical objects with their own properties

almost two decades ago. This became clear after such experimental successes as the discovery

of electronic shell structure in metal clusters [1], observation of plasmon resonances [2,

3, 4], formation of singly and doubly charged negative cluster ions [5] and many more.

Comprehensive survey of the ﬁeld can be found in review papers and books; see, e.g.,

[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].

The electronic shell structure of metal clusters has been discovered in [1] by the obser-

vation of the strong pics in the mass spectra of sodium clusters. The enhanced stability

of some clusters, the so-called magic clusters, was explained by the closure of shells of de-

localized electrons. A simple physical model describing electronic shell structure of metal

clusters has been developed within the jellium approximation (see, e.g., [6]) by analogy with

the shell model of atomic nuclei (see, e.g., [15]). The jellium model is very successful for the

simple alkali metals (Na, K), for which one electron per atom is delocalized [16, 17, 18].

The jellium model electronic shell closures for alkali-metal clusters deﬁne the magic numbers

N = 8, 20, 34, 40, 58, 92 that are in a good agreement with experiment. Note that the

jellium model can be generalized by accounting for the collective ion background vibration

dynamics [19, 20] and be used as a very appropriate framework for the investigating collision

processes involving atomic clusters [21].

Clusters of divalent metals are expected to diﬀer from the jellium model predictions at

least at small cluster sizes. In this case, bonding between atoms is expected to have some

features of the van der Waals type of bonding, because the electronic shells in the divalent

atoms are ﬁlled. Thus, clusters of divalent metals are very appropriate for studing non-metal

to metal transition, testing diﬀerent theoretical methodologies and conceptual developments

of atomic cluster physics. However, relatively little work was done so far on the exploration

of the alkali-earth metal clusters in comparison with that for the alkali-metal clusters; see,

e.g., [6, 22] and references therein.

Previous theoretical studies of the magnesium cluster properties have been performed

using pseudopotential approximation for the treatment of inner electrons in a cluster and

the density-functional theory for the description of outer shell electrons. The electronic

properties, geometry and stability of small Mg metal clusters with the number of atoms

N ≤ 7 have been investigated in [23, 24] using the pseudopotential local-spin-density ap-

proximation. The geometrical structure and bonding nature of MgN clusters with N up to

13 have been studied in [25] using the density-functional molecular-dynamics method. The

size evolution of bonding in magnesium clusters MgN with N = 8 − 13, 16, 20 have been

studied in [26] using the local-density approximation that accounts for gradient corrections.

Structural and electronic properties of small magnesium clusters (N ≤ 13) were studied in

3

[27] using a ﬁrst-principles simulation method in conjunction with the density-functional

theory and the generalized gradient correction approximation for the exchange-correlation

functional. It was shown [27] that the metallization in magnesium clusters has a slow and

nonmonotonic evolution, although, also jellium-type magic clusters were observed [25, 26].

In order to extend such calculations to larger systems, symmetry restricted methods have

been developed. The spherically-averaged-pseudo-potential scheme with the local and non-

local pseudopotentials has been used for the investigation of the electronic structure and

shell closures of spherical MgN clusters up to N = 46 [28].

Recently, new experimental data for Mg clusters have been obtained, indicating the most

intensive pics in the mass spectra at N = 5, 10, 15, 18, 20, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40, 47, 56, 59,

62, and 69 [29]. These numbers deviate from the sequence of magic numbers which were

obtained for simple alkali metal clusters, and cannot be reproduced within simple jellium

models. This fact was interpreted in [29, 30] within the spherical shell model by diving of

the high angular momentum states down through the states with lower l.

In the present work we investigate the optimized ionic structure and the electronic prop-

erties of neutral and singly charged magnesium clusters within the size range N ≤ 21.

We calculate binding energies per atom, ionization potentials and energy gaps between

the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. Our calculations are

based on ab initio theoretical methods invoking the density-functional theory and system-

atic post-Hartree-Fock many-body theory accounting for all electrons in the system. The

results obtained are compared with the available experimental data and the results of other

theoretical works.

unless other units are indicated.

The atomic system of units, |e| = me = ¯h = 1, has been used throughout the paper,

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

Our calculations have been performed with the use of the Gaussian 98 software package

[31]. We have utilized the 6 − 311G(d) basis set of primitive Gaussian functions to expand

the cluster orbitals [31, 32].

The cluster geometries have been determined by ﬁnding local minima on the multidi-

mensional potential energy surface for a cluster. We have taken into account all electrons

4

available in the system, when computing the potential energy surface. With increasing clus-

ter size, such calculations become computer time demanding.

In this work, we limit the

calculations by the cluster size N = 21.

The key point of calculations is ﬁxing the starting geometry of the cluster, which could

converge during the calculation to a local or the global minimum. There is no unique way for

achieving this goal with Gaussian 98 [32]. In our calculations, we have created the starting

geometries empirically, often assuming certain cluster symmetries. Note, that during the

optimization process the geometry of the cluster as well as its initial symmetry sometimes

change dramatically. All the characteristics of clusters, which we have calculated and present

in next section, are obtained for the clusters with optimized geometry.

In this work we concentrate on the systematic exploration of the properties of magnesium

clusters using the density-functional theory based on the hybrid Becke-type three-parameter

exchange functional [33] paired with the gradient-corrected Lee, Yang and Parr correlation

functional (B3LY P ) [34, 35], as well as the gradient-corrected Perdew-Wang 91 correlation

functional (B3P W 91) [36, 37]. The important feature of the density-functional method

consists in the fact that it takes into account many-electron correlations via the phenomeno-

logical exchange-correlation potential. However, so far, there has not been found the unique

potential, universally applicable for diﬀerent systems and conditions. As a result there

are many diﬀerent parameterizations for the exchange-correlation potential valid for special

cases.

Alternatively, we use a direct ab initio method for the description of electronic properties

of metal clusters, which is based on the consistent post-Hartree-Fock many-body theory [38].

In the present work, we apply the Møller-Plesset perturbation theory of the fourth order

(MP 4). Based on the fundamental physical principles being free from any phenomenological

parameters, this model can be reﬁned by extending the quality of the approximations, while

the physical meaning of the eﬀects included is clearly demonstrated. Thus, often such

an approach predicts more accurate and reliable characteristics of metal clusters than the

density-functional theory.

In the present work we use both diﬀerent theoretical schemes for calculations taking

advantage of the clear physical meaning and reliability of the post-Hartree-Fock perturbation

theory and the numerical eﬃciency of the density-functional methods.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Geometry optimization of MgN and Mg+

N clusters

5

The optimization of the cluster geometries has been performed with the use of the

B3P W 91 and B3LY P methods. For small magnesium clusters with number of atoms

N ≤ 11, we have also used the ab initio MP 4 method in addition to density-functional

calculations. With the growth cluster size the ab initio MP 4 calculations become more

and more computer time demanding, therefore we have not performed such calculations for

magnesium clusters with the number of atoms N ≥ 12. The detail comparison of the re-

sults obtained by the density-functional and ab initio perturbation theory methods as well

as their comparison with the results of other works is given below, see section III B. This

comparison allows us to conclude that for magnesium clusters the B3P W 91 method is more

reliable and accurate in comparison with the B3LY P one.

The results of the cluster geometry optimization for neutral and singly charged magne-

sium clusters consisting of up to 21 atoms are shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2 respectively.

Magnesium clusters possess various isomer forms those number grows dramatically with

increasing cluster size. In ﬁgures 1 and 2, we present only the lowest energy conﬁgurations

optimized by the B3P W 91 method. The interatomic distances are given in angstroms. The

values in brackets correspond to the interatomic distances obtained by the B3LY P method.

Figure 1 shows that the neutral magnesium clusters form the compact structures, max-

imizing the coordination number. The Mg2 dimer is weekly bound possessing the binding
energy per atom 0.039 eV/atom and the bond length 3.609 ˚A, which is in a good agreement

with the experimental results of Ref. [39], where the values 0.025 eV/atom for the binding
energy and 3.89 ˚A and for the bond length have been reported. The lowest energy state for

Mg3 is the equilateral triangle, and for Mg4 is a regular tetrahedron. As we discuss below,

the Mg4 cluster is relatively more stable and compact, as compared to the neighbouring

clusters. The Mg5 cluster has a structure of slightly elongated triangular bipyramid, while

Mg6 is a bipyramid with rectangular basis and Mg7 is a pentagonal bipyramid. These

geometrical structures are in a good agreement with the results of Ref. [24].

It is worth to note that the optimized geometry structures for small neutral magnesium

clusters diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those obtained for sodium clusters (see, e.g., [22, 40, 41]

group of the cluster.

and references therein). Thus, the optimized sodium clusters with N ≤ 6 have the plane

structure. For Na6, both plane and spatial isomers with very close total energies exist. The

planar behavior of small sodium clusters has been explained as a result of the successive

ﬁlling of the orbitals 1σ and 1π symmetry by delocalized valence electrons [40], which is

fully consistent with the deformed jellium model calculations [18]. Contrary to the small

sodium clusters, the magnesium clusters are tri-dimensional already at N = 4, forming the

structures nearly the same as the van der Waals bonded clusters.

Starting from Mg9 a new element appears in the magnesium cluster structures. This is

the six atom trigonal prism core, which is marked out in ﬁgure 1. The formation of the

trigonal prism plays the important role in the magnesium cluster growth process. Adding

an atom to one of the triangular faces of the trigonal prism of the Mg9 cluster results in the

Mg10 structure, while adding an atom to the remaining triangular face of the prism within

the Mg10 cluster leads to the structure of Mg11, as shown in ﬁgure 1.

Further growth of the magnesium clusters for 12 ≤ N ≤ 16 leads to the formation of

the low symmetry ground state cluster. In spite of their low symmetry, all these clusters

have the triagonal prism core. Some structural re-arrangement occurs for the Mg16 cluster,

which results in the structure with two connected triangular prisms.

Starting from Mg17 another motif based on the three-layered trigonal prism dominates

the cluster growth. This prism is the basic element of the hexagonal closest-packing (hcp)

lattice, as one can see in ﬁgure 3, where the primitive cell for the magnesium hcp lattice

is presented. Thus, N = 17 is the turning-point in the formation of the hcp lattice for

Vectors a, b and c in ﬁgure 3 show the primitive cell axes of the hcp lattice. For bulk
magnesium a = b = 3.21 ˚A and c = 5.21 ˚A [42]. The fundamental characteristic for the

hexagonal closest-packing of spheres is the value of ratio c/a, which is equal to p8/3 ≈ 1.633

for ideal hcp lattice. The bulk magnesium with c/a = 1.62 is very close to ideal hcp structure

magnesium.

[43].

Table I presents the averaged values of the primitive axes hci and hai for trigonal prisms

marked out in ﬁgure 1 for magnesium clusters with the number of atoms N ≥ 17. Table I

demonstrates that the values hci and hai and their ratio for magnesium clusters with N ≥ 17

are very close to the respective values for bulk magnesium.

Figure 2 shows the optimized geometries of singly-charged cationic magnesium clusters.

The ground state geometries of the cationic magnesium clusters are not very diﬀerent from

those obtained for the neutral parent clusters with the exception of Mg+

3 and Mg+

4 , the

equilibrium geometries of which are linear chains. Below, we discuss the stability of the

linear chain isomers for the magnesium clusters (neutral and singly-charged) within the size

range considered.

In ﬁgure 4, we present the average bonding distance, hdi, calculated within the B3P W 91

approximation for neutral and singly-charged magnesium clusters. When calculating the

average bonding distance in a cluster, interatomic distances smaller than 4.1 ˚A have only

been taken into account. The bulk limit for the magnesium hcp lattice [42] indicated in

FIG. 4: The average bonding distance as a function of cluster size for neutral and singly-charged

magnesium clusters. Stars present the results of the work by Akola et al [27]. The horizontal

dashed line indicates the bulk limit for the hcp lattice [42].

Figure 4 shows how the average bonding distance evolve with increasing cluster size.

It is clearly seen that the dependence of the average bonding distance on cluster size has

essentially non-monotonous oscillatory behavior. For Mg2, the bonding distance calculated
within the B3P W 91 method is equal to 3.609 ˚A, which is in a good agreement with the
experimental result 3.891 ˚A of Ref.

[39]. The appearance of deep minima in the size

dependence of the average bonding distance shows that Mg4, Mg10, and Mg20 clusters

(8, 20 and 40 valence electrons, respectively) are more tightly packed than their neighbours.

This behavior can be interpreted by the inﬂuence of electronic shell eﬀects on the geometrical

structure of magnesium clusters. It supports the conclusion of Ref. [44] that electronic shell

eﬀects can enhance the stability of geometric structures resulting from dense ionic packing.

13

A signiﬁcant step-like increase in the average bonding distance happens at the transition

from Mg16 to Mg17 cluster. As we have discussed above this transition is accompanied by a

considerable re-arrangement of the cluster geometry. Indeed, starting from the Mg17 cluster

the three-layered trigonal prism is formed, as it is shown in ﬁgure 1. The Mg17 cluster has 34

valence electrons which form the closed shell electronic structure, according to the spherical

jellium model. Therefore, it is natural to assume that namely electronic shell eﬀects induce

the structural re-arrangement in the Mg17 cluster that happens to be the turning-point in

the formation of the hcp lattice for magnesium. It is clearly seen in ﬁgure 4 that the average

bonding distance for magnesium clusters approaches the bulk limit for N ≥ 17, with an

exception of the Mg20 cluster, which is more compact due to the electronic shell closure.

The evolution of the average bonding distance with cluster size diﬀers for magnesium

clusters from that for sodium. For neutral sodium clusters, one can see odd-even oscillations

of hdi atop its systematic growth and approaching the bulk limit [22]. These features have

the quantum origin and arise due to the spin coupling of the delocalized valence electrons.

For magnesium clusters, the average bonding distance depends on size non-monotonically,

with minima for the Mg4, Mg10, and Mg20 clusters, as well as with the considerable step-

like increase for the Mg17 cluster. Such an irregular behavior is induced by the closure of

electronic shells of the delocalized electrons.

Manifestation of the magic numbers in the dependence of the average bonding distance

on cluster size coinciding with the spherical jellium model magic numbers does not imply,

however, the rapid metallization of magnesium clusters. To investigate the transition of van

der Waals to metal bonding in magnesium clusters it is necessary to explore in detail the

evolution of their electronic properties. Below we perform such analysis in detail.

Dashed line in ﬁgure 4 shows the average bonding distance as a function of cluster size

calculated for singly-charged magnesium clusters. Figure 4 demonstrates the essential dif-

ference in the cluster size dependence of hdi for the cationic and neutral magnesium clusters

with N ≤ 6. The small cationic magnesium clusters are more compact in comparison with

the corresponding neutral clusters. For example, for Mg+
2 the bonding distance is equal to
3.044 ˚A, which is much less than in the case of Mg2. This phenomenon has a simple physi-

cal explanation: the removed electron is taken from the antibonding orbital. The fact that

cationic magnesium clusters are more stable than the parent neutral and anionic clusters

has been already noted in [24].

14

(1)

(2)

Within the size range 7 ≤ N ≤ 12, the average bonding distances for single-charged and

neutral magnesium clusters behave similarly although the absolute value of hdi for neutral

clusters remains slightly larger. For N ≥ 13, the bonding distances hdi for neural and

singly-charged cationic magnesium clusters become almost identical.

Figure 4 demonstrates the good agreement of our results with the dependence of hdi on

N calculated in [27] for neutral Mg-clusters within the size range N ≤ 13.

B. Binding energy per atom for MgN and Mg+

N clusters.

The binding energy per atom for small neutral and singly-charged magnesium clusters is

deﬁned as follows:

Eb/N = E1 − EN /N

E+

b /N = (cid:0)(N − 1)E1 + E+

1 − E+

N (cid:1) /N,

where EN and E+
respectively. E1 and E+

N are the energies of a neutral and singly-charged N-particle atomic cluster,

1 are the energies of a single magnesium atom and an ion.

Figures 5 and 6 show the dependence of the binding energy per atom for neutral and

singly-charged clusters as a function of cluster size. The energies of clusters have been

obtained using the B3LY P , B3P W 91 and MP 4 methods. Calculations of the binding en-

ergies have been performed by diﬀerent theoretical methods and with the use of diﬀerent

exchange-correlation functionals for the sake of comparison of their accuracy and computa-

tion eﬃciency. In ﬁgure 5 ﬁlled rhombus, crossed rhombus and opened pentagons show the

result of calculations by Kumar et al [25], Reuse et al [24] and Delaly et al [26] respectively.

These calculations have been performed within the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham local-density ap-

proximation using the Perdew and Zunger [45] parameterization of the Ceperley and Alder

[46] data for the exchange correlations. Crossed circles and stars present the results of Delaly

et al [26] and Akola et al [27] derived with the use of the gradient-corrected approximation

[47, 48] and the PBE parameterization of the gradient-corrected exchange-correlation energy

functional [49] respectively.

Figure 5 shows that, although, the qualitative behavior of the binding energy per atom

calculated within diﬀerent approaches is similar, the quantitative discrepancy between the

curves is rather considerable. This is a result of diﬀerent accounting for the gradient cor-

rections to the local-density exchange correlation interaction within diﬀerent methods. The

gradient corrections have been shown to provide a systematic improvement in the computed

properties of magnesium clusters [26]. The diﬀerence in the binding energy per atom for

neutral magnesium clusters with N ≤ 21 calculated with the use of the gradient corrected

B3LY P and B3P W 91 methods reaches 0.35 eV. The reason for this diﬀerence is in the

diﬀerent way of accounting for many-electron correlations within the B3LY P and B3P W 91

methods. To explore what type of parameterization of the exchange-correlation energy is

more reliable for magnesium clusters we have used the post-Hartree-Fock Møller-Plesset

perturbation theory. This method is free of phenomenological parameters and can be used

as a criterion for checking the reliability of various density-functional theory schemes. The

disadvantage of the perturbation theory approach consists in the fact that it leads to the

dramatic growth of the computational costs with increasing the number of electrons in the

system in comparison with that for the density-functional theory calculations. Therefore,

we have used the MP 4 method only for clusters with the number of atoms N ≤ 11.

Figure 5 shows that the results of the MP 4 theory are in a reasonable agreement with

those derived by the B3P W 91 method. This comparison demonstrates that for magnesium

clusters simulations the B3P W 91 method is more reliable than the B3LY P one. Our results

derived within the B3P W 91 and MP 4 approximations are in a good agreement with those

from Ref. [26, 27].

We now discuss the behavior of the binding energy as a function of cluster size for both

neutral and singly-charged magnesium clusters. For neutral magnesium clusters, the binding

energy per atom increases steadily with the growth cluster size. The local maxima of Eb/N

at N = 4, 10 and 20 correspond to the most stable conﬁgurations of the magic magnesium

clusters possessing Nel = 8, 20 and 40 valence electrons respectively. This behavior is in

agreement with the simple spherical jellium model. The analysis of the second diﬀerences

of the binding energy (see Fig.7) conﬁrms this conclusion and makes a hint about relative

stability of the Mg5, Mg7, Mg9, Mg11, Mg13, Mg15, Mg17 − Mg19 clusters, in addition to

the magic clusters Mg4, Mg10 and Mg20 . The additional magic numbers can be explained

within the deformed jellium model accounting for spheroidal deformations of the cluster

core (see, e.g., [16, 17, 18] and references therein). For a spheroidal jellium cluster, the

orbital angular momentum does not remain a good quantum number characterizing the

valence electrons energy levels.

In this case, the energy levels are characterized by the

projection of the angular momentum Λ on the principal axis and by the parity of the wave

function. Thus, the energy levels with Λ = 0 are twofold degenerated on the projection of

the electron’s spin, while those with Λ 6= 0 are fourfold degenerated both on the projection

18

of the electron spin and on the sign of the projection Λ on the principal cluster axis. The

deformed jellium clusters having closed electronic subshells possess the enhanced stability.

Therefore, in addition to the spherical magic clusters with 8, 20, 40 etc valence electrons,

the deformed jellium clusters with 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 36 etc. valence electrons turn

out to be relatively stable. This fact leads to the following additional magic numbers 3, 5,

7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 18 for the jellium magnesium clusters. Some of these numbers, such as

3, 5, 9, 11 precede or follow the spherical magic numbers 4, 10, 20 and as a result of that

become masked and are not that pronounced in the second diﬀerences analysis.

For singly-charged magnesium clusters, the binding energy per atom as a function of

monotonously up to N = 20. The local maxima of the binding energy for the Mg+

cluster size is essentially non-monotonous in the region N ≤ 13. At larger N, it grows

demonstrates the enhanced stability of the mentioned cluster ions and a few additional

The sequence of magic numbers for singly charged magnesium clusters diﬀers from that

for neutral clusters. This happens because singly charged magnesium clusters always possess

odd number of valence electrons and, thus, always contain open electronic shells. For neutral

magnesium clusters, situations of both close and open electronic shells are possible. The

number from N = 4 for neutral Mg-clusters to N = 5 for Mg-cluster ions happens because

the electronic conﬁguration containing an extra electron becomes more favorable for Mg+
5 .

This is not the case for the Mg+

10 and Mg+

20 clusters, those outer electronic conﬁgurations

contain a hole.

The Mg-cluster mass spectra have been recorded in [29] indicating the enhanced stability

of the clusters with N = 5, 10, 15, 18 and 20. In that work the role of the cluster ionization

was not reliably clariﬁed [29] and thus the charge state of the clusters was not reliably

19

determined. As a result, the observed magic numbers sequence should be a combination of

the magic numbers sequences for neutral and singly-charged cluster ions. Thus, N = 5 is

the ionic magic number, N = 10, 18 and 20 are the magic numbers manifesting themselves

clearly for both neutral Mg-clusters and Mg-cluster ions, N = 15 is the neutral magic

cluster number. The experimentally observed enhancement of the mass spectrum in the

region 17 ≤ N ≤ 20 corresponds to the positive values of ∆2EN in this region of N derived
in our calculations. The second diﬀerences are positive and relatively large for N = 13

(neutral clusters) and N = 12 (singly-charged cluster ions). Possibly, the interplay between

neutral clusters and ions make these numbers masked in experiment. The second diﬀerences

are also positive for N = 7 for neutral Mg-clusters and for N = 3 and 7 for Mg-cluster ions,

although the enhancement for those numbers have not been experimentally observed. We

explain this fact by possible suppression of the experimental signal in the region of small N

and relatively small values of the second diﬀerences in the mentioned cases.

The potential energy surface for a cluster becomes more and more complicated with

increasing cluster size. The magnesium clusters are not an exception. Figure 8 demonstrates

this fact where we present the binding energies per atom calculated for a variety of isomers

of neutral magnesium clusters. The corresponding point symmetry groups and the accurate

values of the total energies calculated within the B3LY P and B3P W 91 approximations are

presented in Appendix in tables II and III respectively. Most of the isomer conﬁgurations

have been obtained using the B3LY P method, while the B3P W 91 method has been used

for the exploration of the ground state energy isomers, as well as for the linear and ring-like

isomer structures.

Squares in ﬁgure 8 correspond to the most stable clusters possessing the minimal total

energy. Among the variety of isomers, presented in ﬁgure 8, we mark certain groups of

isomers with the ﬁxed symmetry. So, circles present the linear chains (D∞h point symmetry

group) and the upper triangles correspond to the rings of N atoms (DN h point symmetry

group). It is an interesting fact that among the multitude of the isomers of neutral magne-

sium clusters the linear chains and rings are always stable. We pay a particular attention

to these structures because of their possible applications in nano-technology. Extracting

these isomers and putting them on a substrate one can produce one-atom wide quantum

wires. The linear chains and rings of atoms are also very interesting from the theoreti-

cal point of view, because with their help one can investigate the transition from one- to

two-dimensional structures. For linear chains, the binding energy per atom increases slowly

with the growth the number of atoms, while in the case of rings the value of Eb/N has the

prominent odd-even oscillatory behavior.

This behavior arises as a result of successive ﬁlling the σ- and π-symmetry orbitals by

valence electrons in magnesium linear chains and rings. Indeed, because of its symmetry

the one-dimensional linear chain of N magnesium atoms has the following conﬁguration of

valence electrons: 1σ2, 2σ2, 3σ2, ..., Nσ2. Therefore for any N it has the closed electronic

shell structure. This fact explains the monotonous growth with N of the linear chain binging

energy, and its relative saturation in the region N > 10.

The molecular orbitals for the structure of the ring-type have to be aligned with the plane

of the ring. Such orbitals are fourfold degenerated due to symmetry reasons. The Mg2 dimer

has four valence electrons that occupy spherically-shaped 1σ2 and prolate-like 2σ2 orbitals.

The Mg3 trimer has six valence electrons, two of them occupy 1σ2 state, while the remaining
four electrons ﬁll the fourfold degenerated 1π4 orbital aligned with the plane of the trimer.

With increasing the number of magnesium atoms in the ring, the valence electrons continue

to occupy fourfold degenerated orbitals aligned with the plane of the ring. Therefore, in the

magnesium ring-like isomers with the odd number of atoms all electronic shells are closed,

while the isomers with the even number of atoms have the open electronic shell. This fact

results in the enhanced stability of the magnesium rings with an odd number of atoms

N = 3, 5, 7, 9, ... etc. and explains the odd-even oscillatory behavior of the binding energy

for the magnesium rings.

C.

Ionization potentials and HOMO-LUMO gaps

Let us now consider how the ionization potential of magnesium clusters evolves with

increasing cluster size. The ionization potential of a cluster Vi is equal to the diﬀerence
between the energies of the corresponding cluster ion and the neutral cluster, Vi = E+
Figure 9 shows the dependence of the adiabatic V adiab

respectively.

23

Both the vertical and adiabatic ionization potentials evolve non-monotonously with

increasing cluster size. Figure 9 shows that ionization potential of magnesium clusters

steadily but rather slow decreases towards the bulk limit. This evolution is neither rapid

nor monotonous process.

In order to exclude the inﬂuence of the cluster geometry re-

arrangement, we ﬁrst consider the vertical ionization potential. The size dependence of the

vertical ionization potential has a prominent maximum at N = 4 followed by a sharp de-

crease. Such a behavior of the ionization potential is typical for the jellium model, predicting

maxima in the size dependence of the ionization potential at the magic numbers correspond-

ing to the clusters with closed electronic shells. Our data are in a good agreement with the

results of Ref.

[24], but contradict to those reported in Ref.

[27] for the Mg3 and Mg4

clusters.

In [27] the appearance of the deep minimum in vertical ionization potential at

N = 4 was explained as a result of a stronger charge delocalization in the Mg4 cluster in

comparison with its neibours.

We note that the peculiarities in the ionization potential dependence on N correlate

with the magic numbers that appear for the singly-charged magnesium clusters.

Indeed,

the minima in V vert

correspond to the maxima in E+

i

b /N for Mg-cluster ions (see Fig. 6).

This fact has a simple explanation. The ionization potential of a cluster is equal to the

diﬀerence between the energies of the corresponding cluster ion and the neutral cluster.

For neutral Mg-clusters, the binding energy as a function of N increases steadily with the

growth cluster size, while for Mg-cluster ions - irregularly. Thus, their diﬀerence mimics

all the irregularities that appear in the binding energy dependence on N for singly-charged

magnesium clusters.

For N ≥ 6, the vertical ionization potential changes slowly with increasing cluster size.

This process is characterized by the irregularities that originate due to the inﬂuence of the

cluster geometry on the jellium-type electronic structure of Mg-clusters.

Indeed, the shape of a jellium cluster is deﬁned by its electronic structure. Thus, the

closed shell jellium clusters are spherical, while clusters with opened electronic shells are de-

formed due to the Jahn-Teller distortions. The jellium picture works fairly well for sodium

clusters. The ionization potential of sodium clusters drops rapidly and systematically at the

electronic shell closures. The N-dependence of the ionization potential has prominent, reg-

ular odd-even oscillations (see, e.g., [18, 22] and references therein). Magnesium clusters are

diﬀerent. As discussed in section III A, the evolution of the Mg-cluster geometry is closely

24

connected with the formation of elements of the hcp lattice cell. Although, the electronic

shell eﬀects clearly manifest themselves in the formation of the Mg-cluster geometry, they

do not determine it completely. Another words, there is an interplay of the jellium and the

hcp lattice factors in the formation of the Mg-cluster geometry and the electronic properties

such as the binding energy and the ionization potential.

The adiabatic ionization potential dependence that is shown in ﬁgure 9 exhibits quali-

tatively the same behavior as the vertical one, however, has more pronounced irregularities

due to geometry re-arrangements of the ionized clusters.

Figure 10 shows the gap Eg between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied

molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO gap) for the Mg-clusters as a function of cluster size.

For the sake of comparison, we have also calculated the HOMO-LUMO gap for the sodium

clusters and present it in ﬁgure 10. Calculations have been performed using the B3P W 91

and B3P LY P methods. The geometries of neutral sodium clusters have been taken from

[22]. For the small magnesium clusters with N ≤ 13, we compare our results with those

presented in Ref. [27].

The size dependence of Eg for neutral sodium clusters has an oscillatory behavior with

local maxima at N = 6, 8, 10, 14 and 20. These maxima correspond to the electronic shell

closures in a full accordance with the deformed jellium model. The local maximum in the

size dependence of Eg at N = 12 and the shift of the local maximum from N = 18 to N = 17

are the consequences of triaxial deformations [22]. Thus, the triaxial deformation leads to

the splitting of the fourfold degenerated highest occupied orbital on two twofold degenerated

orbitals. As a result of that the additional shell closure at the Nel = 12 appears.

For Mg-clusters, the evolution of the HOMO-LUMO gap with the growth cluster size

diﬀers from that for Na-clusters. The gap Eg calculated for magnesium clusters shows the

oscillatory behavior accompanied by the gradual decrease in the absolute value. Maxima

in this dependence have diﬀerent origin. Thus, the increase of Eg at N = 4, 10 and 20

correspond to the magic numbers of the spherical jellium model (Nel = 8, 20 and 40 respec-

tively). The similar feature also does exist for Na-clusters at N = 8 and 20. The drop in

Eg at N = 8, 11 and 16 is the result of the signiﬁcant structural change, which we observe

for Mg-clusters at those numbers.

As discussed in section III A, the basic element of the Mg-cluster geometry for N ≤ 8

is pyramid. Starting from Mg9 the new element, namely the six atom trigonal prism,

determines the Mg-cluster structure. The prominent structural change arises at N = 12,

when the high symmetry of the system reduces to the point symmetry group Cs. For N ≥ 17

another motif based on the three-layered trigonal prism dominates the cluster growth.

The analysis of the HOMO-LUMO gap evolution for Mg clusters supports our conclusion

on the role of the interplay of the jellium and hcp lattice factors in the formation of Mg

cluster properties.

We note that the HOMO-LUMO gap remains rather large even for the clusters with

N ≥ 17 possessing elements of the hcp lattice of the bulk Mg. This fact conﬁrms the

conclusion on the slow and non-monotonous evolution of metallic properties in Mg clusters.

IV. CONCLUSION

The optimized geometries and electronic properties of neutral and singly-charged mag-

nesium clusters consisting of up to 21 atoms have been investigated using the B3P W 91,

B3LY P and MP 4 methods accounting for all electron in the system. The detailed com-

parison of the results of the phenomenological B3P W 91 and B3LY P density-functional

methods with the results of the systematic ab initio post-Hartree-Fock many-body theory

leads us to the conclusion that the B3P W 91 method is more reliable for Mg-cluster simu-

lations than the B3LY P one.

We have investigated the size evolution of the Mg-clusters geometry. It has been shown

that starting from Mg17 the three-layered trigonal prism structure determines the cluster

growth, which is the basic element of the hcp lattice for the bulk magnesium.

We have investigated the electronic properties of magnesium clusters. It has been shown

that the electronic shell eﬀects and jellium-like behavior clearly manifest themselves in the

formation of geometrical properties, however, the shell eﬀects do not determine the geometry

of Mg clusters completely. We have demonstrated that due to the interplay of the jellium and

the hcp lattice factors the electronic properties of magnesium clusters possess irregularities

which can not be explained within the simple jellium model. It has been shown that the

metallic evolution of magnesium clusters is slow and non-monotonous process.

The results of this work can be extended in various directions. One can use the similar

methods to study structure and properties of various types of clusters. It is interesting to

extend calculations towards larger cluster sizes and to perform more advanced comparison

27

of model and ab initio approaches. A lot of novel problems arise, when considering collisions

and electron excitations in the clusters with the optimized geometries [21]. These and many

more other problems on atomic cluster physics can be tackled with the use of methods

considered in our work.

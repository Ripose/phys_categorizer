(Dated: January 4, 2014)

The eﬀect of intense X-ray laser interaction on argon clusters is studied theoretically with a mixed
quantum/classical approach. In comparison to a single atom we ﬁnd that ionization of the cluster
is suppressed, which is in striking contrast to the observed behavior of rare-gas clusters in intense
optical laser pulses. We have identiﬁed two eﬀects responsible for this phenomenon: A high space
charge of the cluster in combination with a small quiver amplitude and delocalization of electrons
in the cluster. We elucidate their impact for diﬀerent ﬁeld strengths and cluster sizes.

The advent of femtosecond laser pulses has triggered
numerous activities in the ﬁeld of laser-matter interac-
tion. In particular novel, non-linear processes in atoms
induced by the available high intense ﬁelds from these
ultrashort pulses have been a challenge for experiment
and theory [1]. To understand more generally the energy
transfer from intense laser light to matter, complex tar-
gets like atomic clusters have been studied [2, 3, 4, 5].
These experiments received considerable attention due
to the observed dramatic eﬀects like emission of very fast
ions [2] and electrons [3] or the production of coherent
X-ray radiation [4]. So far such studies are almost ex-
clusively restricted to visible or infrared wavelengths [6].
The new X-ray free electron laser (xfel) sources, under
construction at DESY in Hamburg [7] and at the LCLS
in Stanford [8], will change this situation. They can de-
liver intense laser pulses at high frequencies (from VUV
to hard X-ray) and thus open a new regime of strong-ﬁeld
atomic physics.

Here we present theoretical

investigations of X-ray
(frequency ¯hω = 350 eV, i. e. wavelength λ

laser interaction with argon clusters at intensities of
1018 W/cm2.
In this laser regime

the interaction is notably diﬀerent from long-wavelength
pulses which is evident from the ponderomotive energy
I/ω2. It represents the average kinetic energy

of a free electron in a laser ﬁeld, while ∆x
the quiver amplitude of the electron, i. e., the spatial ex-
cursion in the laser ﬁeld. For the given laser parameters
one ﬁnds Epond
0.4 meV . . . 4 eV, vastly diﬀerent from
Epond
20 eV . . . 200 keV for a 780-nm-laser at the same
intensities. The small ponderomotive energy has two im-
portant consequences: (i) Despite the high intensities the
laser-atom interaction is of non-relativistic and pertur-
bative nature. The latter is also clear from the so-called
Keldysh parameter γ which gives the ratio between the
tunneling time and the laser period [9] and can be rewrit-
ten in terms of the binding energy Ebind and the pondero-
motive energy Epond as γ = (Ebind/2Epond)1/2. For the L
and M -shells of argon with Ebind = 326, 249, 29.3, 15.8 eV
we always ﬁnd γ > 1 and for the inner shells even
γ
1. Obviously the laser period is far too small
for ﬁeld- or tunnel-ionization. Rather, ionization is due
to single-photon absorption. (ii) Ponderomotive eﬀects

[10] are completely negligible with quiver amplitudes of
∆x

0.0003 . . . 0.03 ˚A.

Under the aforementioned laser conditions one expects
exhaustive ionization leading subsequently to a gigan-
tic Coulomb explosion of the irradiated argon clusters,
since ionization proceeds fundamentally diﬀerent from
that under optical laser impact. Ionization starts from
the inside because photoionization cross sections at X-ray
wavelengths are considerably higher for the inner shells
than for the valence shells [11]. Typically the inverse
rates are with 1 . . . 10 fs [12] much smaller than the pulse
length of about 100 fs. Hence, multiple single-photon ion-
ization is possible, in particular because the inner-shell
holes created by photoionization are reﬁlled by Auger-like
processes. The Auger decay is more or less independent
of the atomic charge state and occurs fast, typical times
are 0.2 . . . 5 fs [13]. Due to this almost instantaneous re-
ﬁlling of the inner shells they can be ionized many times
during the pulse and thus the atoms can be eﬃciently
“pumped dry”. This occurs “inside-out” and is the ex-
act opposite to the ionization mechanism in the visible
wavelengths regime where the electrons are removed from
the outside like shells of an onion [14]. Finally, local ionic
charges in the cluster, generated in the course of the ion-
ization process, may be screened by the weakly bound
valence electrons of cluster atoms. Therefore, these elec-
trons are allowed to tunnel through the barriers between
the mother atom and neighboring ions. Such electrons
will predominantly move inside the cluster since there
is no ﬁeld (such as the quasi-static electric ﬁeld of low-
frequency lasers) which would drive them away from the
charged cluster into the continuum.

In order to gain insight into the laser induced dynam-
ics we use a mixed quantum/classical approach similar to
those successfully applied in studying rare-gas clusters
in strong pulses of visible light [14, 15, 16]. Electrons
initially bound to atoms in the cluster are not explic-
itly treated, they only enter through their binding en-
ergy. The ionization from the mother atom in the clus-
ter, also called inner ionization, is modelled statistically
by sudden transitions according to quantum mechanical
rates. An inner ionization event gives birth to a quasi-
free electron which is subsequently propagated classically
along with the ions and other quasi-free electrons with all

(cf. Fig. 1). One reason for the reduced ionization in the
cluster compared to the atom is the much larger space
charge produced in a cluster. At f = 10 au the total clus-
ter charges Q after the pulse are Q1
65, and
220 for atoms and clusters of 13 and 55 atoms,
Q55
respectively. Such high space charges suppress ioniza-
tion, because the absorption of one single photon trans-
fers only a ﬁxed amount of energy to the electron.
In
our model, these post-collisional interaction eﬀects are
taken into account by the propagation of the photoion-
ized electrons. For larger cluster and higher ﬁelds, i. e.
higher space charges, one ﬁnds that an increasing num-

Coulomb forces included. Note that a quasi-free electron
is not necessarily ionized with respect to the cluster as a
whole, quasi-free means only inner-ionized with respect
to the mother atom or ion.

The ionization/excitation dynamics in strong X-ray
pulses is considerably more complicated than ﬁeld [14]
or tunnel [15, 16] ionization in optical pulses because
inner-shell electrons and intra-atomic processes are in-
volved. For the photoionization rates we use a parameter-
ization of the cross section which covers all charge states
of atomic argon [17]. For high ionic charges the electronic
binding energy can become so large that single photoion-
ization is impossible. Non-dipole eﬀects do not have any
crucial impact apart from distortions of the angular dis-
tribution of the photoelectrons [18]. For modelling the
intra-atomic decay cascades we use direct Hartree-Fock
calculations [13]. They provide branching ratios and de-
cay rates for Auger, Coster-Kroning, and radiative tran-
sitions. The latter ones are typically at least one order of
magnitude slower [13]. For the intra-cluster charge equi-
libration we calculate tunnel (or over-the-barrier) rates
in analogy to [15, 16]. All the rates are used to decide
at every time step of the simulation whether a particular
transition occurs or not. Once the electrons are created
with their respective kinetic energy (to guarantee energy
conservation in the photo-absorption process or in the
Auger decay [19]) they are propagated in the ﬁeld of the
other particles.

From the physics described so far it is clear that the
initial coupling to the laser is individual atom-photon in-
teraction only. Hence, it is particularly interesting to see
how the cluster environment aﬀects the laser interaction
which can be most clearly seen from calculations com-
paring atoms and clusters. The laser pulse is given by
f (t) = f
sin(ωt) with the electric ﬁeld strength f ,
the laser frequency ω, and the pulse shape function

where T is the pulse length. Figure 1 shows the ﬁ-
nal charge per atom for two diﬀerent clusters, Ar13 and
Ar55, compared to a single atom for a laser pulse with
¯hω = 350 eV, T = 100 fs, and f = 0.1 . . . 10 au (atomic
unit). At lower ﬁeld strengths (f = 0.1 au), only a single
photoionization event with one subsequent Auger decay
per atom occurs independently of the cluster size. Af-
ter a quite steep rise the ﬁnal charge starts to saturate
in the atomic case for stronger ﬁelds (f > 0.3 au) due
to the fact that single photoionization becomes impossi-
ble beyond a certain charge state of the ion at the given
photon frequency. The rise of the ﬁnal charge per atom
in the cluster is notably weaker. Therefore — in strik-
ing contrast to optical laser-cluster interaction — clusters
are less eﬀectively ionized at high ﬁelds than atoms. The
reduction is even more pronounced for the larger cluster

ber of electrons are bound at the end of the pulse to one
of the fragment ions.

Figure 2 shows the energy absorbed from the laser
pulse for the same clusters. This observable provides
direct insight into the photoionization since all the other
processes (intra-atomic decay, intra-cluster screening) are
not inﬂuenced by the laser due to its high frequency. Sur-
prisingly, for all ﬁeld strengths considered, the absorption
of photons itself is reduced in the environment provided
by the cluster. This was unexpected because of the fact
that predominantly deep-lying inner-shell electrons are
aﬀected and possible eﬀects on the photoionization rates
of these strongly localized electrons from neighboring ions
are unlikely and in fact not contained in the model.

The time evolution of the cluster dynamics reveals that
a delocalization of the valence electrons is indirectly re-
sponsible.
It has mainly two eﬀects: Firstly, the pho-
toionization cross sections become very small since the
electrons are far away from the nucleus. Secondly, also
the Auger decay rates are reduced because the overlap
with the core holes becomes smaller. Before quantifying
these eﬀects we will look at the electron dynamics in de-
tail. Figure 3 shows the time evolution of an Ar55 cluster
for the same pulse parameters as before at a ﬁeld strength
of f = 1 au. At every time step each electron is assigned
to the cluster ion with which it has the largest instant
binding energy. In this way we deﬁne a “hopping” time
which is the time an electron stays at the same ion before
it moves to another one. The upper panel of Fig. 3 shows
that the average “hopping” time is less than 1 fs during
the ﬁrst half of the pulse (t < 50 fs). This is very short
compared to typical inverse ionization rates and indicates
that the electrons move almost freely inside the cluster
volume. Hence, the low barriers between the cluster ions
in the early phase of the pulse make inner ionization very
eﬀective. As can be seen in the middle panel of Fig. 3, a
considerable fraction of the quasi-free electrons has ener-
gies above these barriers. This will change only towards
the end of the pulse (t = 100 fs) when due to the expan-
sion of the cluster (cf. the cluster radius in Fig. 3) the
barriers rise again.

It is diﬃcult to assign photoionization or autoioniza-
tion rates to this “sea” of electrons. However, one can
give estimates of these rates using the fact that they de-
pend in a characteristic manner on the energy of the re-
spective bound electron. The quasi-free electrons have
a binding energy Efree (since they are still bound with
respect to the full cluster). This energy will be com-
pared to Ebound the binding energy of the weakest bound
electron in the atom, which is among the bound elec-
trons the most stable one against ionization. The ratios
Efree/Ebound, averaged over all the electrons, are shown
in the lower panel of Fig. 3. Compared to the low rates of
the bound electrons the photoionization rate falls oﬀ like
(Efree/Ebound)7/2 [11] and the Auger decay rate roughly
like (Efree/Ebound)3/2 [20]. Due to this scaling the rates
are reduced during the pulse by a factors of about 5 and
20, respectively. Obviously, also those electrons with en-

3

ergies below the barriers are still well above the highest
bound electrons and hence fairly delocalized. One has to
emphasize that this estimate is an upper bound since the
rates decrease even more for higher angular momentum
states [11, 20] which are likely to be populated by the
intra-cluster dynamics. Therefore, we regard it as save
to neglect absorption of photons or autoionization of the
quasi-free electrons.

As we have seen in addition to simply lower absorption
rates the reduction of photon absorption is also due to
the fact that the inner shells to be ionized are no longer
eﬃciently reﬁlled by inter-atomic decay, i. e. the cluster is
temporarily hollow. In order to assess the relative impor-
tance of this eﬀect compared to the suppression of ion-

ization due to the cluster space charge we have repeated
our cluster calculations without the possibility for tun-
neling of electrons between cluster ions. Figure 4 shows
the ﬁnal charges from these restricted calculations for

Ar13 and Ar55 along with the full calculation for these
clusters and the atom. The diﬀerence between the two
cluster calculations with and without tunneling (marked
by grey shading in Fig. 4) accounts for the delocalization
eﬀect. The diﬀerence between the restricted cluster cal-
culation (the dash-dotted line in Fig. 4) and that for the
atom reveals the space charge eﬀect. For ﬁeld strengths
f
0.3 au, where diﬀerences between atom and clusters
appear, the space charge eﬀect is initially weaker. This
changes for stronger ﬁelds: Whereas for the smaller clus-
ter Ar13 both are of the same magnitude at f = 10 au, for
the larger cluster Ar55 the space charge eﬀect dominates
at this ﬁeld strength.

≥

In conclusion, we have found suppression of ionization
for small argon cluster compared to isolated atoms in the
same pulse of intense X-ray radiation. This behavior is
in striking contrast to that of rare-gas clusters in intense
optical lasers. Two eﬀects are responsible for the diﬀer-
ence: Firstly, the high positive space charge of the cluster
hinders electron emission since the space charge is not
compensated by a large quiver motion. Secondly, delo-
calization of electrons in the cluster reduces photoioniza-
tion as well as autoionization drastically. Both eﬀects are
more important for the larger cluster investigated and the
relative weight of both eﬀects depends on ﬁeld strength
and cluster size. Our ﬁndings indicate that in general the
coupling of energy from the laser light to matter is less
eﬀective at high frequencies. This has important conse-
quences for xfel imaging applications since it implies a
higher damage threshold. That is, fragile samples might
survive irradiation by intense pulses of high frequency
better than anticipated.

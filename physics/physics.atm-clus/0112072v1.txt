Polarizabilities of Gen clusters with 2 to 25 atoms are
calculated using coupled-perturbation Hartree-Fock (CPHF)
and ﬁnite ﬁeld (FF) method within density functional the-
ory. The polarizabilities of the Gen clusters increase rapidly
in the size range of 2 to 5 atoms and then ﬂuctuate around
the bulk value. The polarizabilities are sensitively dependent
on the cluster geometries and electronic structures. The large
HOMO-LUMO gap may lead to the small polarizability. As
compared with the compact structure and diamond structure,
the prolate cluster structure corresponds to a larger polariz-
ability.

In the past two decades, the structural and electronic
properties of semiconductor clusters have been exten-
sively studied because of their fundamental interest and
potential application in nanoelectronics1–25. The small
semiconductor clusters are well understood up to 10
atoms. But our knowledge for larger clusters is still quite
limited. The polarizability is one of the most impor-
tant quantities of the clusters, which can yield the static
dielectric constant in the bulk limit through Classius-
Mosotti relation. On the other hand, the polarizability
can provide some information on the bonding and geo-
metrical features of the clusters. Thus, comprehensively
understanding of the polarizabilities from theoretical cal-
culations is important in cluster science. The jellium
model26,27 was successfully applied to study the polariz-
ability of large metallic clusters. But for semiconductor
clusters, the bonding and geometrical eﬀects are not in-
corporated in the jellium model. Alternatively, the ab
initio calculations based on quantum chemistry meth-
ods are needed. There were only few previous ab initio
calculations on the polarizabilities of the clusters28–33.
Especially, for the germanium clusters, there is only one
attempt to calculate the polarizabilities and the cluster
size is quite limited28.

In our previous studies34, the geometries of Gen clus-
ters (n = 2 − 25) have been obtained by density func-
tional DMol calculations35 incorporated with a genetic
algorithm36–38. It was found that the Gen clusters follow
a prolate growth pattern with n ≥ 13. The stacked lay-
ered structure and the compact structure compete with
each other in intermediate size range. Based on the previ-
ously optimized low-energy structures, in this paper, we

will study the polarizabilities of these clusters using the
analytically coupled-perturbation Hartree-Fock (CPHF)
and numerically ﬁnite ﬁeld (FF) methods within density
functional theory. We aim to explore the size dependence
of the polarizability, the inﬂuence of the atomic and elec-
tronic structures on the polarizabilities of the Gen clus-
ter.

It is well known that electron correlation plays a pri-
mary role in determining molecular polarizabilities. DFT
treatment has been proven to make signiﬁcant improve-
ment to Hartree-Fock results in molecular polarizabili-
ties and hyperpolarizabilities calculations39,40. Within
DFT framework, B3LYP functional considers the hy-
brid between the Hartree-Fock exchange and Kohn-Sham
orbitals42–44, while LANL2DZ basis set45 can give a good
description of the bonding and geometrical features of
heavy atoms. Thus, B3LYP/LANL2DZ scheme is ex-
pected to well describe the cluster polarizabilities at ac-
ceptable computational cost. Here, all these calculations
are performed at B3LYP/LANL2DZ level by using Gaus-
sian98 package41.

The energy in an external electric ﬁeld can be ex-

panded as

E(F ) = E(0) − µiFi −

αij FiFj − · · ·

where E(0) is the energy without the external ﬁeld, Fi
are components of the applied ﬁeld. The dipole moment
µi and the polarizability αij are deﬁned as:

Within Kurtz’s ﬁnite ﬁeld method46, the dipole moment
and polarizability in a uniform ﬁeld, can be derived from
the follow equations.

To check the validity of current method, we ﬁrstly cal-
culate the dipole polarizability of small silicon clusters.
Table I compares our calculations with previous theoret-
ical and experimental results. The current theoretical
dipole moments for the clusters Si2−7 are in agreement
with Vasiliev et al28. But our results for the dipole mo-
ment of Si8−10 clusters are diﬀerent due to the substantial
diﬀerence in geometrical conﬁgurations. The present geo-
metric structures for Si clusters are consistent with those
obtained by Shvartsburg et al. and Li et al.15,24. Our
calculated polarizabilities seem to be overestimated as
compared with Vasiliev et al28, but consistent with Deng
et al32. Moreover, the present polarizabilities are sensi-
tively dependent on the cluster size and oscillate with the
cluster size. While the polarizabilities in Vasiliev’s work
tend to decrease with the increase of the size. Exper-
iments show that the polarizabilities ﬂuctuate with the
cluster size.

To calculate of the dipole µ and the polarizability α,
at least 13 self-consistent ﬁeld (SCF) runs are neces-
sary with the ﬁeld strengths ±Fi and ±2Fi (i = x, y, z).
One of the most severe problems in ﬁnite-ﬁeld method
is the choice of an appropriate ﬁeld strength47. Sim et
al.48 have assessed the numerical accuracy against dif-
ferent ﬁeld values and concluded that stable linear and
nonlinear polarizabilities can be obtained when F equals
0.001 ∼ 0.005 a.u.
In this work, the external ﬁeld is
added along x, y, z with the magnitude 0.001 a.u and a
tighter SCF convergence criterion of 10−9 is adopted.

The measured data in experiments are usually the av-

erage polarizabilities, which can be obtained by

< α >=

(αxx + αyy + αzz)

The optimized structures for Ge11−25 clusters at
B3LYP/LANL2DZ level are shown in Fig.1. Similar
equilibrium conﬁgurations are found by DMol and Gaus-
sian98. Therefore, the details for the structures will not
be discussed here.

Table II gives the dipole moments, average polarizabil-
ities, binding energies and HOMO-LUMO gap as func-
tions of the cluster size. The dipole moments calculated
with CPHF method and FF method are compared and
agree well with each other. The dipole moment reﬂects
the symmetry of the geometrical structure: the smaller
dipole moment corresponds to the higher symmetry. The
dipole moments for the clusters with n = 2, 4, 5, 7 are
nearly zero, corresponding to the high symmetry in these
clusters. For Ge4, the lowest energy structure is D2h
rhombus, while they are trigonal bipyramid with D3h and
pentagonal bipyramid (D5h) for Ge5 and Ge7. In the case
of Ge8 , Ge9 and Ge10, capped pentagonal bipyramid,
tricapped trigonal prism and tetracapped trigonal prism
have favorable energy, respectively. The dipole moments
and the polarizabilities of small Ge clusters are compared
with Vasiliev et al.28 and our calculations seem to be a
little overestimated.

izability and the electronic structures of clusters. Fig.3
plots the polarizabilities as a function of the HOMO-
LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO)) energy gaps.
As shown in Fig.3, the large polarizability generally cor-
responds to the small HOMO-LUMO gap. The clusters
with n = 8, 11, 13, 15 have relatively smaller polarizabil-
ities in comparison with their neighboring size. For ex-
ample, the HOMO-LUMO gap for Ge8 is 1.10eV and the
polarizability is just 5.17 ˚A3/atom. The polarizabilities
decrease with the increase of the HOMO-LUMO gap ex-
cept for the clusters Ge2, Ge5 and Ge19−22. This can be
easily rationalized using the two-level model51,52,

where µ2

is the transition dipole moment from the

∆t the corresponding transition energy. Approximately,
∆t can be replaced with HOMO-LUMO energy gap ∆.
From this model, α increases with decreasing ∆ , con-
sistent with our calculated trend for most Ge clusters.
However, α is not a simply inverse proportion relation
to ∆, since the two quantities are dependent each other.

the polarizability of the bulk Ge is 4.5˚A3/atom. The
present average polarizability of the clusters is larger than
that of the bulk. Previous studies have shown that the
prolate structure contributes a large polarizability30,50.
The prolate conﬁguration is preferred for medium-sized
Ge clusters, which occupies larger distortion and lower
symmetry in comparison with diamond structure. Thus,
the polarizability of the clusters is larger than that of the
bulk. It is worthy to note that the present results is quite
diﬀerent from Vasilier’s28. Compared with their method,
the present scheme incorporate the electron correlation
in the calculation of the polarizability of small clusters.
We further discuss the relationship between the polar-

However, the polarizability of the cluster is not only de-
pendent on HOMO-LUMO gap but also closely related
to geometrical characteristics. For example, the HOMO-
LUMO gap of Ge18 is larger than that of Ge19, while the
polarizability of the former is larger than that of the lat-
ter. This can be attributed to their structural diﬀerence.
For Ge18, the optimized structure is two interpenetrate
pentagonal connected with a bicapped square antiprism
Ge10 subunit, while a more compact cage-like geometry
is favorable to Ge19. The compact structures have rela-
tively less and shorter bonds, which leads to the valence
electrons binding tighter. Thus, a smaller volume is ob-
tained in the compact structure, which causes a smaller
polarizability for Ge19. Similarly, the diﬀerent polariz-

3

abilities behavior of the clusters with n = 19 − 22 can
be explained in the light of their respectively geometri-
cal characteristics. For Ge20 and Ge21, their optimized
structures are stacked layer conﬁgurations and have the
comparable volume, which leads to their almost same po-
larizabilities. In the case of Ge19 and Ge22, since our cal-
culated lowest energy structures are both near-spherical
compact structures, they also have the tantamount po-
larizability.

In conclusion, we have calculated dipole moments and
polarizabilities of Gen(n = 2 − 25) clusters with both
CPHF and FF approaches under B3LYP/LANL2DZ
scheme. The main results are summarized as follow-
ing.
(1) The Ge clusters with n = 2, 4, 5, 7 have rel-
atively higher symmetry and the dipole moments are
nearly zero. (2) The polarizabilities of small clusters in-
crease rapidly in the range of 2 to 5 and ﬂuctuate around
5.4 ˚A3/atom. Moreover, the polarizabilities of the clus-
ters with n = 8, 11, 13, 15 are larger than the neighboring
ones. (3) The polarizabilities are closely related to the
HOMO-LUMO gaps and the geometrical conﬁgurations.
The larger the HOMO-LUMO gap, the smaller the polar-
izability of the Ge clusters. The prolate structures corre-
sponds to relatively large polarizabilities in comparison
with the compact structures.

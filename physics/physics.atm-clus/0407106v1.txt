Abstract

Using the basin-hopping Monte Carlo minimization approach we report the global minima for

aluminium, gold and platinum metal clusters modelled by the Voter-Chen version of the embedded-

atom model potential containing up to 80 atoms. The virtue of the Voter-Chen potentials is that

they are derived by ﬁtting to experimental data of both diatomic molecules and bulk metals simul-

taneously. Therefore, it may be more appropriate for a wide range of the size of the clusters. This

is important since almost all properties of the small clusters are size dependent. The results show

that the global minima of the Al, Au and Pt clusters have structures based on either octahedral,

decahedral, icosahedral or a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral packing. The 54-atom icosa-

hedron without a central atom is found to be more stable than the 55-atom complete icosahedron

for all of the elements considered in this work. The most of the Al global minima are identiﬁed

as some fcc structures and many of the Au global minima are found to be some low symmetric

structures, which are both in agreement with the previous experimental studies.

INTRODUCTION

Since Richard Feynman’s famous challenging talk There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom

in 1959 [1], many scientists all over the world are still studying on the investigation and

fabrication of nanometer scale (10−9 m) structures and devices. In his talk, he challenged

scientists to develop a new ﬁeld of study where devices and machines could be constructed

from components consisting of a small number (tens or hundreds) of atoms. The use of

metal and semiconductor clusters as components of nanodevices is one of the most important

reasons which explains why there are considerable theoretical and experimental interest in

the study of gas phase and supported metal clusters in the last few decades [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Due

to their ﬁnite size, these small particles may have totally diﬀerent structures and material

properties than their bulk crystalline forms. Furthermore, these properties may sometimes

change drastically whenever a single atom is added to or removed from the cluster [7]. A

systematic study of evolution of these properties with size allows elucidation of the transition

from the molecular structure to condensed matter phase. Clusters, in particular metal

clusters, play an important role in many chemical reactions as catalysts, as well. The

structure of small metal clusters in a reaction can have a major eﬀect on the rate of formation

of products [8].

In this study, using the basin-hopping [9] Monte Carlo minimization approach we re-

port the global minima for aluminium, gold and platinum metal clusters modelled by the

Voter-Chen [10] version of the embedded-atom model (EAM) [11] potential containing up

to 80 atoms. The virtue of the Voter-Chen potentials is that they are derived by ﬁtting to

experimental data of both diatomic molecules and bulk metals simultaneously. Therefore,

it may be more appropriate for a wide range of the size of the clusters. This is important

since almost all properties of the small clusters are size dependent.

This paper is organized as follows: The interaction potential and the computational

procedure will be discussed in Section II. Results and discussions are presented in Section

III, and conclusions are given in Section IV.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

A. The Voter-Chen Potential

In any N-scaling energy expression, the total energy, Etot of a system of N atoms can be

written as a sum

In the EAM, the conﬁguration energy Ei of each atom i is represented as

where Fi is the embedding term, φij is the pairwise-addition part of the interaction between

atoms i and j, rij is the distance between atoms i and j, and ¯ρi is the total ”host” electron

density at the position of atom i:

Etot =

Ei.

φij(rij) + Fi( ¯ρi),

¯ρi = X
j6=i

ρj(rij).

(2)

(3)

The sums over neighboring atoms j are limited by the range of the cutoﬀ for φ and ρ,
which is approximately 5 ˚A for the metals considered in this work. Key to the EAM

is the nonlinearity of the function F (¯ρ) which provides a many-body contribution to the

energy. If F were purely linear, the two terms in Eq.2 could be collapsed to give a simple

pair potential. Thus, a nonlinear F (¯ρ) provides a many-body contribution to the energy.

Because ¯ρi depends only on scalar distances to neighboring atoms, the many-body term has

no angular dependence. Nonetheless, this spherically symmetric, many-body interaction is

quite important.

All the parameters in the Voter and Chen model were determined by minimizing the

root-mean-square deviation (χrms) between the calculated and experimental values of three
elastic constants (C11, C12, and C44), the unrelaxed vacancy formation energy (Ef

vac) of the
bulk metals (Al, Au and Pt), and of the bond length (Re) and bond strength (De) of their

diatomic molecules.

B. The Basin-Hopping Algorithm

Two new and more successful algorithms have been developed within the last two decades

to search the global minimum of an energy landscape, which are diﬀerent than the traditional

3

random search and simulated annealing techniques: basin-hopping and genetic algorithms.

The genetic algorithm is a search based on the principles of natural evolution [12], while

the basin-hopping approach belongs to the family of hypersurface deformation methods [13]

where the energy is transformed to a smoother surface. The basin-hopping algorithm which

we have used in the present work is based upon Li and Scheraga’s [16] Monte Carlo (MC)

minimization, and it has been developed and employed for several systems by Doye and

Wales [9, 14, 15]. In the basin-hopping algorithm, the transformed potential energy surface
(PES), ˜E(X), is deﬁned by ˜E(X) = min{E(X)}, where X represents the vector of atomic

coordinates and min signiﬁes that an energy minimization is performed starting from X.

Unlike many PES transformations, this basin-hopping transformation guarantees to preserve

the identity of the global minimum. The topography of the transformed surface is that of a

multi-dimensional staircase ( a set of interpenetrating staircases with plateaus corresponding

to the basins of attraction of each minimum). Since the barriers between the local minima

are removed in the transformed PES, vibrational motions within the well surrounding a

minimum are removed. In addition, transitions from one local minimum to another in the

transformed PES can occur at any point along the boundary between these local minima,

whereas on the untransformed surface transitions can occur only when the system passes
through the transition state. Consequently, on ˜E(X), the system can hop directly between

the basins; hence it is the name of this transformation.

We have used the GMIN [17] program in our simulations to locate the lowest energy

structures of the Voter-Chen Al, Au and Pt clusters. The MC runs have been started with

the conﬁgurations which are the global minima of the Morse clusters. For a given size, as

the interaction range of the Morse potential changes, the global minimum varies. Diﬀerent

global minima for diﬀerent interaction ranges of the Morse potential were reported up to

80-atom clusters before [18, 19]. We have reoptimized all these Morse global minima by

performing several MC runs of 100,000 steps of each.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Aluminium Clusters

It goes back to the middle of the 1980s that a number of theoretical studies of Al clusters

have been carried out by diﬀerent groups [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,

32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. These studies range from the simple jellium model [20]

where the cluster geometry is ignored, to a number of models where the geometry explicitly

enters into the picture including semiempirical molecular orbital calculations [21], quantum

molecular dynamics [26, 27, 28, 29, 31], quantum-mechanical calculations based on quantum-

chemical [22, 23, 24] and density-functional [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] theories (DFT)

within local density or local spin-density approximations, molecular dynamics and Monte

Carlo simulations based on empirical model potentials [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. Especially the

icosahedral Al13 has been studied intensively [24, 32]. The most recent and more extensive

density-functional calculations have been presented by Ahlrichs and Elliott [29] and by Rao

and Jena [33] in 1999. These studies focused both on electronic and structural properties

of neutral and ionized Al clusters up to 15 atoms, respectively. On the other hand, while

the empirical model potential studies [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39] cannot calculate the electronic

properties of the clusters, it is possible to search PES of higher sized clusters with them since

they are computationally much less demanding than ab initio calculations. In these model

potential studies carried out by random search, simulated annealing or genetic algorithms,

Al clusters are described by an empirical many-body potential [34], two-plus-three body

Murrell-Mottram potential [35, 36, 37], Gupta [38] or Sutton-Chen [39] potentials. Similarly,

the experimental studies on Al clusters [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] go back

to the middle of the 1980s. It is known that while the electronic factors determine cluster

stability for alkali metal clusters [52], packing and surface energy eﬀects dominate on the

structure of alkaline earth elements, such as calcium and strontium [51]. Aluminium places

at a central position between the regimes of electronic and geometric shells [45]. Martin’s

mass spectroscopic studies [51] have shown that Al clusters with up to a few hundred atoms

have face-centred cubic (fcc) packing structures. These experimental interpretations have

been conﬁrmed by theoretical calculations using empirical potentials [38] and DFT [29].

Jarrold and Bower have performed experiments on smaller Al clusters which enabled them

5

to determine the topologies of clusters with tens of atoms [41].

We have reported the total energies (E), the point groups (P G), and the structural

assignments (SA) (whenever possible) of the global minima for the Al clusters up to 80

atoms described by the Voter-Chen potential in Table I. The point groups of the structures

are determined with OPTIM program [17]. Symmetry elements are diagnosed when rotation

and reﬂection operators produce the same geometry (correct to 0.001) in each Cartesian

coordinates. The energies and the second ﬁnite diﬀerences in energies

(4)

(5)

D2E(N) = El(N + 1) + El(N − 1) − 2El(N)

are plotted in Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively. Following Northby et al. [53] and Lee and

Stein [54], the function,

E0 = aN + bN 2/3 + cN 1/3 + d,

is ﬁtted to the energies given in Table I, and it is subtracted from the energies of the clusters

in order to emphasize the size dependence.

In this polynomial function, a describes the

volume, b surface, c edge, and d the vertex contributions to the energy. D2E is generally

correlated with the magic numbers observed in mass spectra. Clusters are particularly

abundant at magic number sizes in mass spectra since they are the most stable ones [55].

The triangulated polyhedral structures of the Al7-Al80 global minima are illustrated in

Fig. 2. The structures for the ﬁrst seven AlN clusters (N = 2 − 8) are similar to those

obtained by other empirical potentials for aluminum [36, 39] and other metals [14, 56]. Al3

forms an equilateral triangle, Al4 a tetrahedron, Al5 a trigonal bipyramid, Al6 an octahedron,

Al7 a pentagonal bipyramid, and Al8 is a bicapped octahedron. All of these structures are

located as the global minima of Au and Pt clusters in the present work, too. Al9 can be

described as a three capped trigonal prisms and Al10 is a hexadecahedron, which are the

same with Joswig and Springborg’s calculations of Al clusters employed by Sutton-Chen

potential [39]. Structures of the Al clusters with N = 11 − 14 atoms are icosahedral. The

Al15 is the sixfold icositetrahedron. The 16- and 17-atom Al clusters involve a mixture of

decahedral and icosahedral staking sequences. The Al19 is a double icosahedron. In the size

range of N = 20 − 36, all clusters have face-sharing icosahedral (fsI) structures possessing

generally low symmetries. Above the size of 36, the most of the Al clusters are fcc packed.

This is consistent with Martin’s experimental study [51] with the exceptions of the 40-, 51-,

53- and 54-atom uncentred icosahedral (ucI) structures, the 55-atom centred icosahedron,

6

and the 60-, 64-, 67-, 72-, 73- and 74-atom decahedral (dec) structures. As a result the total

number of fcc Al clusters having more than 36 atoms is 26.

It can be seen from both of the Figs. 1(a) and (b) that the most stable structure occurs

at size 13 which corresponds to complete Mackay icosahedra [57]. The other relatively

more stable structures with respect to their neighboring sizes are N=38, 50, 54, 61, 68

and 75 corresponding to truncated octahedron, twinned truncated octahedron, uncentred

icosahedra [58], and some other three fcc structures, respectively.

B. Gold Clusters

Gold nanoparticles are a fundamental part of recently synthesized novel nanostructured

materials and devices [59, 60, 61]. Structural characterization using a variety of experimental

techniques can be performed on Au clusters [62, 63, 64, 65, 66]. Experiments suggest

that gold nanoclusters with diameters of 1-2 nm, corresponding to aggregates with N=20-

200 atoms, are amorphous [62, 63]. The theoretical studies on gold nanoclusters change

from empirical MD or MC simulations using EAM [67], Gupta [68], Sutton-Chen [14] and

Murrell-Mottram [69] potentials to some ﬁrst-principle calculations using DFT [70, 71],

generalized gradient approximation [72], spin-polarized Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr functional [73],

and Hartree-Fock and post Hartree-Fock levels [74].

We have reported the total energies (E), the point groups (P G), and the structural as-

signments (SA) (whenever possible) of the global minima for the gold clusters of N=2-80

atoms described by the Voter-Chen potential in Table II. The energies and the second ﬁ-

nite diﬀerences in energies are plotted in Figs. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The triangulated

polyhedral structures of the Au7-Au80 global minima are illustrated in Fig. 4. In our cal-

culations we have found that Au9-Au14 clusters are icosahedral. The 13-atom icosahedron

has been reported as the lowest energy structure of a Au13 cluster by some of the previous

empirical studies [14, 69] as well, although they have presented some other structures for

some of the gold clusters in this size range. However, the icosahedron is not the global

minimum in the ﬁrst principle calculations of Wang et al. [71]. In addition, in many of the

ab initio studies the lowest energy structures of the small clusters are found to be some

planar forms [70, 71, 72]. This is because of the fact that since the empirical many body

methods are lack of directionality, these potentials favor more compact, spherically symmet-

7

ric structures. However, this discrepancy between the ﬁrst principle and empirical methods

vanishes when the cluster size increases. In our results the global minima of Au15, Au16,

Au18, and Au19 are the same as those of the corresponding Al clusters. Similar to the Al

clusters, in the size range of N = 20 − 36, all gold clusters have fsI structures. The 37-atom

cluster has a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral morphologies. The 38-atom cluster is a

truncated octahedron. We have found only two more fcc structures (at N = 61 and N = 79)

in the global minima of Au clusters above this size. In agreement with many of the previous

theoretical calculations, the Au55 is not a icosahedron in our calculations too, although 52-,

53-, and 54-atom Au clusters are ucI. For the size range of N = 64 − 79, the dominant struc-

tural motif is the decahedral morphology. While the 64-, 71-, and 75-atom clusters have

perfect decahedral structures, the 66-, 72-, 73-, 74-, 76-, and 77-atom clusters have some

icosahedral deﬁciencies on their decahedral backbones. Our results for the Au clusters are in

agreement with the experimental suggestion that gold nanoclusters with N=20-200 atoms

are amorphous [62, 63] since the most of the structures reported in the present work have

low symmetry (i.e., Cs). Fig. 3(b) suggests that the most stable structures occur at sizes of

13, 30, 40, 54, 66, 73, 75 and 77. The 38-atom truncated octahedron does not seem as a

magic number of the Au clusters, instead a 40-atom amorphous structure is more stable. For

the higher sizes, decahedral structures and mixtures of decahedral and icosahedral staking

sequences become more stable than the others, except the 54-atom uncentred icosahedron.

C. Platinum Clusters

We have reported before the lowest energy structures, the numbers of stable isomers,

growth pathways, probabilities of sampling the basins of attraction of the stable isomers,

and the energy spectrum-widths which are deﬁned by the energy diﬀerence between the

most and the least stable isomers of Pt2-Pt21 clusters [56] and the global minima of Pt22-

Pt56 clusters [58]. Since all relevant literature of platinum clusters can be found in those

studies, we do not repeat them here once more. We have reported the total energies (E), the

point groups (P G), and the structural assignments (SA) of the global minima of Pt clusters

described by the Voter-Chen potential for N ≤ 80 atoms in Table III. The energies and

the second ﬁnite diﬀerences in energies are plotted in Figs. 5(a) and (b), respectively. The

triangulated polyhedral structures of the Pt7-Pt80 global minima are illustrated in Fig. 6.

8

The lowest energy structures of the Pt clusters are more similar to those of the Au clusters

than those of the Al clusters. All the global minima of Au and Pt clusters are identical for

N ≤ 17. The 18-atom Pt cluster does not have the decahedral morphology of the Au18

cluster. In the size range of N=19-38, the most of the Pt clusters have ucI structures which

are similar to the cases for both Al and Au clusters. In this size range, 12 Pt clusters have

identical structures with the corresponding Au clusters (i.e., at the sizes of 19-21, 26, 28-30,

32, 33, 36-38). The main diﬀerences between the Au and Pt clusters occur at the sizes of 41,

50, 51, 55, 70, 74, 76, 78, and 80: the 41-atom Pt cluster has a mixture of decahedral and

icosahedral morphologies, the 50-atom Pt cluster is a twinned truncated octahedron, the 51-

atom cluster is an uncentred icosahedron missing three surface atoms, the 55-atom cluster

is a complete Mackay icosahedron, the 70-, 74-, and 76-atom clusters are some decahedrons

and ﬁnally the 78- and 80-atom Pt clusters have a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral

staking sequences. For the higher sizes, while Pt clusters prefer fully decahedral structures,

the Au clusters favor structures involving a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral staking

sequences (see the sizes of 70, 74, and 76). When the normalized energy (Fig. 5(a)) and

second ﬁnite diﬀerence in energy plots (Fig. 5(b)) of the Pt clusters are considered, it can

be seen that the most stable sizes are 13, 38, 50, 54, 61, 68, and 75. Interestingly, these

magic numbers are more similar to those of the Al than those of the Au clusters.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In the present study, we have reported the global minima of Al, Au and Pt clusters

up to 80 atoms described by the Voter-Chen version of the EAM potential in a basin-

hopping MC geometry minimization technique. The results show that the global minima

of the Al, Au and Pt clusters have structures based on either fcc, decahedral, icosahedral

or a mixture of decahedral and icosahedral packing. The 54-atom icosahedron without a

central atom is found to be more stable than the 55-atom complete icosahedron for all of

the elements considered in this work. The most of the Al global minima are identiﬁed as

some fcc structures as the previous experimental studies suggest. Many of the Au global

minima are found to be some low symmetric structures, which is also in some agreement

with the experimental studies of the Au clusters. Although many of the Pt global minima

are identical with the global minima of the corresponding Au clusters, the most stable sizes

9

of the Pt clusters occur at the same sizes of the Al clusters.

Abstract. We ﬁnd that for simple metal clusters a single-electron description of the
ground state employing self-interaction correction (SIC) in the framework of local-
density approximation strongly contaminates the high energy photoionization cross
sections with spurious oscillations for a subshell containing node(s). This eﬀect is
shown connected to the unphysical structure that SIC generates in ensuing state-
dependent radial potentials around a position where the respective orbital density
attains nodal zero. Non-local Hartree-Fock that exactly eliminates the electron self-
interaction is found entirely free from this eﬀect. It is inferred that while SIC is largely
unimportant in high photon-energies, any implementation of it within the local frame
can induce unphysical oscillations in the high energy photospectra of metal clusters
pointing to a general need for caution in choosing appropriate theoretical tools.

The local-density approximation (LDA), along with its time-dependent version, is a
standard theoretical technique to describe the structure and dynamics of large systems.
From a practical standpoint, LDA is typically preferred to other conventional many-
body methods (such as, Hartree-Fock (HF) or techniques based on conﬁguration-
interactions) because of its relatively low computational costs.
In the context of
the studies involving static and dynamical properties of simple metal clusters LDA
has proved to be particularly successful [1-3]. However, a well known drawback of
LDA is that it only partially accounts for unphysical electron self-interactions. As a
consequence, the resulting potential for a ﬁnite system decays exponentially at large
distance instead of producing the physical 1/r behavior. To render the long distance
behavior of the LDA potential realistic, therefore, approximation schemes have been
suggested [4]. The most general and widely applied to remedy the error is the one
proposed by Perdew and Zunger [5], which concerns an orbit-by-orbit elimination of
self-interaction, although the scheme immediately makes the potential state-dependent.
The self-interaction corrected LDA (LDA-SIC) improves remarkably the vast variety
for instance,
of results related to many structural properties of physical systems:

improvements in total energies of atoms, allowance for self-consistent bound solutions
for negative ions, prediction of orbital energies that are close to electron removal energies
thus restoring Koopmans’ theorem, ensuring dissociation of heteronuclear molecules to
neutral fragments, improvement of the band gap in solids etc. (a good account in this
regard may be found through Ref. 4). In the dynamical regime too, especially in the
context of low-energy photoionization of simple metal clusters, the description of the
electronic ground state via LDA-SIC results in important many-body eﬀects including
single electron Rydberg resonances [6,7].

At photon-energies well beyond the ionization threshold the photospectrum shows
special qualitative behavior. For spherical jellium clusters over this energy range theory
predicts a characteristic oscillation in the cross section with a frequency connected to
the cluster diameter. The mechanism behind this oscillatory pattern is the interference
of electron waves emanated from equivalent sites of the cluster edge [8]. While there
has been no experimental study on metal clusters, oscillations in the photoelectron
intensity are indeed observed for fullerene molecules [9]. Generically, the high energy
photoionization process should be rather sensitive to the degree of accuracy in the
description of the ground state. This can be understood from the fact that in an
independent particle model the high-energy transition matrix element has a leading
contribution from the Fourier transform of the ground state wavefunction to the
photoelectron momentum space (or retarded-momentum space if non-dipole interactions
are included) [10]. From such an elementary viewpoint, LDA-SIC may also appear
to be a suitable tool for the high energy photoionization studies of various cluster
systems. However, this paper shows that while the correction for self-interaction is
virtually unimportant in the study of energetic photoionization of metal clusters, any
approximation to it in a local frame can generate spurious oscillations in the cross
section for photoelectrons emerging from subshells having orbital node(s). The point is
illustrated by presenting calculations on Na20, which can be well described by a spherical
jellium model, and which is the smallest system (1s21p61d102s2) having one subshell (2s)
with a node.

The usual single electron potential in the Kohn-Sham LDA formalism is

VKS(~r) = Vjel(~r) + Vd[ρ(~r)] + Vxc[ρ(~r)]

(1)

where the terms on the right-hand-side are respectively jellium, direct (Hartree)
d~r′ρ(~r′)/|~r − ~r′|, and exchange-correlation potentials. The ground state
Vd[ρ(~r)] =
electronic density ρ(~r) is deﬁned in terms of single-electron densities ρi and orbitals φi:

As mentioned earlier, an approximate prescription for SIC to this LDA potential (1)
is to eliminate orbitalwise from the outset those terms which represent an electron i
interacting to itself. The resulting orbital-speciﬁc potentials, therefore, are

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side in the above expression is exactly derivable by a
variational approach from the HF exchange energy of a uniform electron system with
a uniform positively charged background; the second term is the so called correlation
potential, a quantity not borne in HF formalism. We use LDA potentials both with
and without SIC approximation to calculate the dipole photoionization cross sections
upto approximately 1 KeV photon-energy for each subshell of the Na20 cluster in the
independent particle frame†. Calculations are also performed in the self-consistent HF
scheme to better identify the origin of the resulting discrepancy between the two LDA
predictions. Quantities are in atomic units throughout, except where speciﬁed otherwise.
LDA and LDA-SIC cross sections for each of the 1s, 1p and 1d subshells are found
to be almost identical at high enough energies showing a single monotonic oscillation.
Results using HF for these subshells yield similar qualitative behavior. The situation,
is quite diﬀerent for the 2s photoionization. Figure 1 presents 2s cross

Generally, in the low-energy range for all subshells of Na20 HF predictions are diﬀerent
from LDA owing to the partly non-identical ground state correlation they account for
and this causes a constant phase diﬀerence between them at higher energies, where
such correlation eﬀects are insigniﬁcant. Bearing this in mind we ﬁnd in ﬁgure 1 that
while LDA and HF again maintain the same trend oscillationwise, LDA-SIC points
to a progressively strong qualitative diﬀerence starting roughly from 40 eV photon-
energy. To identify closely the discrepancy between σ2s with and without SIC we have
evaluated the Fourier transforms of σ2s(k2s) (see ﬁgure 2). Both LDA and HF are seen
to have approximately the same Fourier spectrum with just one peak. But LDA-SIC
contains three additional peaks beside the one that is common to all three spectra.
This common frequency is connected to the diameter of the cluster. In fact, a simple
theoretical analysis shows that high energy photo cross sections of a spherical jellium
cluster oscillate in the respective photoelectron momentum space at a frequency 2Rc,
where Rc is the cluster radius [8]. However, where do the other frequencies in the
LDA-SIC 2s cross section come from?

In order to answer this we need to take a close look at the single-electron ground
state LDA and LDA-SIC radial potentials. As pointed out earlier, in LDA formalism
“all” electrons of the system in the ground state experience the same potential deﬁned
by equation (1) which for Na20 is denoted by the dotted curve in ﬁgure 3. The potential,
as is typical for a cluster, is ﬂat in the interior region (region of de-localized quasi-free
electrons) while showing a strong screening at the edge around Rc; the unphysical

beyond the jellium frame, will not change our result qualitatively.

exponential decay at the long range may be noted. Switching to the LDA-SIC scheme,
electrons in every orbital now feel a distinctly diﬀerent potential (see equation (2)) with
an approximately correct long range behavior as represented by four solid curves in ﬁgure
3. In this group of four SIC potentials the ones for 1s, 1p, and 1d look qualitatively
similar to the LDA potential but are slightly deeper. The 2s potential, on the other
hand, exhibits a unique feature: a strong local variation around the position r = Rn. To
pin down how this structure in the 2s LDA-SIC potential comes about we need to focus
on the SIC exchange correction Vxc[ρ2s(~r)]. This quantity, with reference to expression
(3), can be explicitly written as:

Vxc[ρ2s(~r)] = −

The 2s orbital density, ρ2s(~r) = |φ2s(~r)|2, in the above equation, vanishes at r = Rn
as the 2s radial wavefunction passes through its node at Rn. Consequently, Vxc[ρ2s(~r)]
generates a cusp-like structure in the neighborhood of Rn that shows up in the LDA-
SIC potential proﬁle for the 2s orbital. Since the behavior here is directly connected
to the zero in the 2s electron density we stress that it must also occur in any alternate
prescription for Vxc[ρ2s(~r)] diﬀerent from formula (2). We further emphasize that this
structure is entirely an artifact of an externally imposed SIC in a purely local frame,
which certainly is an approximation since a complete cancellation of self-interactions
requires an appropriate non-local treatment of the electron-exchange phenomenon as
In fact, a forced localization of the exchange (Fock) term in
in the HF formalism.
the HF scheme does indeed produce an inﬁnite singularity in the potential at the zero
of the corresponding one-electron state function [12]. Nevertheless, the structure from
LDA-SIC has a direct bearing on the subsequent 2s photoionization matrix element by
producing an unphysical oscillation.

To behold the underlying mechanism let us consider the photoionization dipole
matrix element. We use for convenience the acceleration gauge representation of the
dipole interaction that involves the gradient of the potential seen by the outgoing
electron. After carrying out angular integration with the assumptions of spherical
symmetry and unpolarized light, one is left with a reduced radial matrix element for
a dipole transition nl → ǫl′ that in the acceleration formalism is < ψǫl′|dV /dr|ψnl >.
Figure 4 shows that the derivatives of both the LDA potential and the LDA-SIC 2s
potential peak close to r = Rc.
In fact, the ﬁrst derivative of any general cluster
potential always peaks at the edge Rc, and therefore, the overlap integral in the radial
matrix element has dominating contribution coming from the edge [8]. Further, for high
enough energy ψǫl′ can be described in the ﬁrst Born picture as a spherical wave with
asymptotic form cos(knlr + δl′). This immediately suggests that the matrix element
will oscillate in the knl space with roughly a frequency that is equal to the distance of
the peak derivative point from the origin. As a consequence, resulting cross sections
should exhibit an oscillation as a function of knl with a frequence 2Rc (since the cross
section is the squared modulus of the matrix element). As mentioned before, this

eﬀect is already known and can be related to the common frequency peak in ﬁgure 2.
However, something additional happens for the LDA-SIC case. The structure induced
by the wavefunction node in the LDA-SIC potential for the 2s orbital produces a sharp
discontinuity at Rn in dV2s/dr, as also seen in ﬁgure 4. Such a derivative-discontinuity
induces a second oscillation in the respective overlap integral with a frequency about Rn
[13]. Subsequently, the 2s cross section with SIC acquires four oscillation frequencies:
Rc − Rn, 2Rn, Rc + Rn, and 2Rc (see ﬁgure 2) as a result of the interference. Evidently,
the ﬁrst three frequencies are artiﬁcial being connected to the unphysical structure in
the potential. Non-local HF, which exactly eliminates electron self-interaction terms,
is free from this eﬀect (as is seen from ﬁgures 1 and 2). Moreover, the qualitative
agreement of HF with LDA suggests that SIC is practically unimportant at high enough
photon-energy. This is simply because with predominant contribution coming from the
potential edge for higher energies any improvement in the asymptotic behavior of the
wavefunction does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the overlap integral. Therefore, for large
systems where HF becomes computationally impracticable the usual LDA may be a safe
choice in the high-energy regime. On the other hand, the fact that slower photoelectrons
with their longer wavelength can hardly “resolve” this nodal structure explains why low-
energy cross sections in LDA-SIC are practically uncontaminated. It is also simple to
understand that there is nothing special about 2s photoelectrons, for the eﬀect must
also be present in the case of subshells having more than one node.

The characteristic potential for any de-localized electron system, as in a metal
cluster, has a nearly ﬂat interior region. Any rapid variation in this potential occurring
in a small range can, therefore, have considerable eﬀect on the photoionization overlap
integral by signiﬁcantly altering the amplitude of the continuum wave across this range.
For atomic systems, however, electrons are far more localized owing to the strong nuclear
attraction, and therefore, wavefunctions are far more compact around the nucleus. The
near-Coulombic shape of a typical atomic potential with steep slope close to the origin
can practically overwhelm any local variation as the one discussed in this paper. In order
to verify this, we applied LDA-SIC for some typical cases of atomic photoionization
without any problem.

It is true that SIC in the LDA frame induces certain extensiveness in the calculations
by making the potential state-dependent. One possible simpliﬁcation is to average over
all such state-dependent potentials and use the averaged one for all electrons. We applied
such an average-SIC potential to examine whether or not the eﬀect reduces. We ﬁnd
that not only the eﬀect survives but that it also now substantially aﬀects photoelectrons
from subshells without a node because the wavefunction overlap across the nodal zone
is rather strong for them since their ground state wavefunctions are large in this region.
However, it remains to be seen what happens if the potential is further approximated
by a simpliﬁed-implementation of SIC, namely, the optimized eﬀective potential method
[14]. Finally, it has recently been found in the context of atoms that the independent
particle model breaks down for the high energy photoionization due to the interchannel
coupling eﬀect [15]. There is no a priori reason to assume that this will not be the case

for cluster systems, although no study has yet been made. Nevertheless, in the future
even if a multi-channel frame (namely, the time-dependent LDA which is akin to the
random-phase approximation) is needed to characterize the energetic photoionization of
clusters, this spurious eﬀect will remain, at least qualitatively, and may also aﬀect those
channels whose single channel description is otherwise error-free.

To summarize, we have shown that the theoretical analysis in the framework of
LDA with SIC incorporated may invoke unphysical strong qualitative variations in
high energy photospectra of metal clusters for electrons emitted from a subshell with
node(s); although there is no denying that LDA-SIC is one of the strong methodologies
available to address low-energy processes. Through a comparison with the results via
non-local HF, that is intrinsically free from the self-interaction error, we conclude that
the diﬃculty is connected to an inexact footing of SIC in the LDA formalism. Hence,
it is important to choose appropriate theoretical techniques suitable for a given energy
range to avoid mis-interpretation of various eﬀects in cluster photo-dynamical studies.

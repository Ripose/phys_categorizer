Abstract

We analyze particular two-photon processes as possible means to explore electronic quadrupole

states in free small deformed atomic clusters. The analysis is done in the time-dependent local

density approximation (TDLDA). It is shown that the direct two-photon population (DTP) and

oﬀ-resonant stimulated Raman (ORSR) scattering can be eﬀectively used for excitation of the

quadrupole states in high-frequency (quadrupole plasmon) and low-frequency (infrared) regions,

respectively. In ORSR, isolated dipole particle-hole states as well as the tail of the dipole plasmon

can serve as an intermediate state. A simultaneous study of low- and high-frequency quadrupoles,

combining DTP and ORSR, is most eﬀective. Femtosecond pulses with intensities I = 2 · 1010 −

2 · 1011W/cm2 and pulse durations T = 200 − 500 fs are found to be optimal. Since the low-lying

quadrupole states are dominated by one single electron-hole pair, their energies, being combined

with the photoelectron data for hole states, allow to get the electron spectrum above the Fermi

level and thus greatly extend our knowledge on the single particle spectra of clusters. Besides, the

developed schemes allow to estimate the lifetime of the quadrupole states.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the achievements in laser technologies have lead to a remarkable progress

in the analysis of electronic degrees of freedom in atomic clusters, for an extensive review see

[1]. For example, photoelectron spectra (PES) can now be measured with a high accuracy

and for a broad variety of clusters [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. However, a wealth of electronic modes

still remains unexplored. In clusters with the diameter far below the laser wavelength (i.e.

in clusters with the number of atoms N < 106 − 108), the laser light couples only to dipole

(λ = 1) states. Hence we gain the well known dipole plasmon. At the same time, it is still

very hard to access the electronic modes with higher multipolarity λ > 1. Multi-photon

processes can generally give a way to these modes. For example, two photons couple to

quadrupole (λ = 2) modes [9]. Just this case, investigation of quadrupole modes of valence

electrons in two-photon processes, will be scrutinized in the present paper. In a previous

publication [10], we have studied the scenario of two-photon processes where both photons

originate from the same laser pulse and so have the same frequency. In this paper, we will

analyze an alternative two-photon technique employing two diﬀerent laser frequencies. It

will be shown that the combined implementation of both techniques is most optimal for the

exploration of electronic quadrupole states.

A particularly interesting aspect emerges for low-frequency (infrared) quadrupole modes

in small deformed clusters. It was found that these modes are dominated by a single electron-

hole (1eh) pair [9, 10] and their spectra are close to the pure 1eh energy diﬀerences ǫeh =

ǫe − ǫh. As a result, measuring the energy ǫeh in a two-photon process and the energy of

the hole (occupied) state eh by PES [2, 3, 4], we gain information on the particle energy

ǫe. This allows to determine the full single-particle spectrum of valence electrons near the

HOMO-LUMO (highest occupied molecular orbital - lowest unoccupied molecular orbital)

gap. Being sensitive to diverse cluster’s features (equilibrium shape, ionic structure, ...),

the electronic spectra can in turn serve for investigations of these features. Besides they

constitute a critical test of any theoretical description.

It is worth noting that, unlike the dipole states with their high frequencies and strong

collective mixing, the quadrupole states of interest mainly originate from the deformation

splitting [9, 10]. Their energy scale is thus quite small and they usually lie in the infrared

region < 1eV . In small clusters the spectrum of these states is very dilute. This prevents

2

collective mixing of the states, favors their 1eh nature, and simpliﬁes the experimental

discrimination. Diﬀerent kinds of small deformed clusters (free, supported, embedded) can

be explored for the infrared quadrupole modes. In this paper we will consider the simplest

case of free clusters.

Two-photon processes allow to excite not only the low-frequency quadrupole modes, but

also high-frequency quadrupole states in the regime of the quadrupole plasmon.

In fact,

these plasmon states carry a large quadrupole strength and thus rather easily respond to

two-photons probes. The two sorts of quadrupole modes can be characterized in terms of

transitions between major quantum shells of the cluster mean ﬁeld [9]. The low-frequency

quadrupole modes correspond to 1eh excitations within the valence quantum shell N (∆N =

0 modes). The high-frequency states in the quadrupole-plasmon range correspond to the

excitations over two major shells (∆N = 2 modes). There are still no any experimental data

about both kinds of modes. But their investigation could deliver a valuable spectroscopic

information.

As mentioned above, the excitation of quadrupole states needs at least a two-photon

process. A variety of such processes is known in atomic and molecular spectroscopy [11,

12, 13, 14]. However, to our knowledge, none has been applied so far in experimental

investigations of atomic clusters. Some of these processes, namely the direct two-photon

population (DTP) [10], the oﬀ-resonant stimulated Raman scattering (ORSR) [12], and the

stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) [13, 14], seem to be quite promising [15] and

are thus worth a closer inspection. As is shown below, some particular cluster properties,

e.g. high probability of undesirable plasmon population, complicates implementation of

two-photon schemes. Hence we need a detailed analysis based on realistic calculations. As

a ﬁrst step in this direction, the pump-probe DTP method was recently investigated [10].

In this method the electronic infrared quadrupole state is generated via the direct resonant

two-photon (two-dipole) excitation by the pump laser, see the DTP scheme at the left part

of ﬁgure 1. The population of the quadrupole state is detected through the appearance of

satellites in the photoelectron spectra produced by a probe pulse (not shown in ﬁgure 1).

Femtosecond pump and probe pulses with intensities I = 2 · 1010 − 2 · 1011W/cm2 and pulse

duration T = 200 − 500 fs were found to be optimal. The systematic TDLDA calculations

have shown that the method is very robust and delivers not only the 1eh spectrum but also

the lifetime of the 1eh pairs.

FIG. 1: Schemes of two-photon processes: direct two-photon (DTP) in a two-level system and

oﬀ-resonant stimulated Raman (ORSR) in a three-level Λ-system. The initial |0i, intermediate |1i,

and target |2i states have the orbital moments λ =0, 1, and 2, respectively. In ORSR the pump

dipole pulse couples the ground and intermediate states while the Stokes dipole pulse provides the

coupling of the intermediate and target states. ∆ is the detuning from the intermediate dipole

state |1i. The purpose of both DTP and ORSR is the population of the target quadrupole state

|2i.

In the present paper, we aim to inspect an alternative two-photon method, oﬀ-resonant

stimulated Raman scattering (ORSR). In this method, the target quadrupole state is pop-

ulated by two diﬀerent dipole transitions via an intermediate dipole state. Hence we deal

with the so called Λ-system, see right part of ﬁgure 1. The pump pulse provides the cou-

pling of the initial (ground) state |0i to the intermediate state |1i. The Stokes pulse couples

|1i with the quadrupole target state |2i, altogether stimulating the transition to the target

state. The pulses have to maintain the two-photon resonance condition ωp − ωs = ω2, i.e.

the diﬀerence of the pump and Stokes frequencies must coincide with the frequency of the

target quadrupole state. Isolated dipole states of 1eh nature as well as the dipole plasmon

can serve as the intermediate state |1i. However, one should avoid a real population of the

intermediate state to prevent undesirable leaking into competing channels. This is especially

important for the dipole plasmon which decays via a fast Landau damping associated with

a short lifetime (∼ 10 − 20 fs) [1]. To avoid the actual population of |1i, we will use an

appreciable detuning ∆ from the energy of this state, hence the reference to oﬀ-resonant

process. A considerable detuning is the crucial point in our scheme. Detection of the pop-

ulation of the target quadrupole states (both at low- and high-frequency) in the ORSR can

be done by a probe pulse in the same way as in the DTP [10]. As compared with DTP, the

ORSR scheme is more involved since it requires not two but three diﬀerent pulses (pump,

Stokes and probe). At the same time, the ORSR allows to explore the low-lying quadrupole

4

D
states by lasers in the region of visible light and hence is an interesting alternative to DTP.

Besides, ORSR is widely used in atomic and molecular physics. It is certainly worth to assay

this method for atomic clusters as well.

In the present study, we will apply the ORSR to low-frequency quadrupole states. How-

ever, as is shown below, it is hard to explore these states without touching the high-frequency

quadrupoles which very easily respond to any two-photon probes. Both kinds of quadrupole

states should thus be involved into a realistic exploration scheme. The high-frequency

quadrupoles can hardly be studied within the ORSR in Λ-conﬁguration because in this

case we would need the intermediate dipole state lying above the quadrupole plasmon [24].

It is hence better to explore these quadrupoles by DTP. As a result, we naturally come to a

combined analysis implementing the ORSR for the low-frequency quadrupoles and the DTP

for their high-frequency counterparts. The aim of the present paper is to develop optimal

schemes for the combined DTP-ORSR method.

The paper is outlined as follows.

In Section 2 the calculation scheme is sketched.

In

Sec. 3 the ORSR excitation of the low-frequency quadrupole is discussed for two cases of

the intermediate state: an isolated dipole state and tail of the dipole plasmon. Stability of

the process to variation of the main parameters is scrutinized. The DTP population of the

quadrupole plasmon states is outlined and the general scheme for the combined DTP-ORSR

experiment is developed. The conclusions are drawn in Sec. 4.

II. CALCULATION SCHEME AND TEST CASE

The theoretical and numerical framework of our study are explained in detail elsewhere

[1, 16]. So we summarize here only the key points. The calculations are performed within

the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) using the exchange-correlation

functional of [17] and an averaged self-interaction correction [18]. As a ﬁrst step, the static
single-electron wave functions ¯φi(~r) are calculated from the stationary Kohn-Sham equations.

Then time evolution of the single-electron wave functions φi(~r, t) is computed starting from
the initial condition φi(~r, t = 0) = ¯φi(~r). The ionic background is treated in the soft jellium

approximation [1]. This approximation, although a bit daring, is capable of reproducing

the basic trends of shapes and subsequent plasmon spectra of Na clusters [19, 20, 21]. In

the present paper we consider axially deformed clusters and therefrom Na+

11 as a particu-

larly suitable test case. The axial symmetry and jellium approximation together greatly

reduce the computational eﬀort and thus allow huge scans in the multi-parameter space

of multi-photon processes even in deformed clusters. Absorbing boundary conditions are

employed for the description of photoionization. The numerical handling is performed by

standard methods (gradient iterations for the ground state, time splitting for time propa-

gation). The excitation spectra in the linear response regime are computed in TDLDA by

standard techniques of spectral analysis [16, 22]. The laser induced dynamics is simulated

by adding to the TDLDA the laser pulses as classical external dipole ﬁelds of the form
W (t) = E0 z sin2(πt/T ) cos(ωt) with the ﬁeld strength E0 (∝ square root of the intensity I)
lasting for one half-cycle of the proﬁle function sin2(πt/T ). The ﬁeld is applied in z-direction

(the symmetry axis of the system); ω is the frequency and T is the pulse duration. Small

deformed sodium clusters are optimal for a ﬁrst exploratory analysis. We consider here the
test case Na+

11. It is strongly prolate which provides a comfortably strong collective split-

ting of the plasmon resonance and of the single-electron spectrum. Its infrared spectrum

below 1 eV is very dilute and displays only three well separated electronic levels, namely

the quadrupole modes of multipolarity λµ=20, 21 and 22 (see Table 1). Following our esti-

mations [9], these modes almost correspond to pure 1eh states as indicated in Table 1. The

collective shifts of these states through the Coulomb residual interaction are modest, e.g.

∼ 0.05 eV for λµ=20, which corroborates their 1eh structure. This feature is a direct con-

sequence of the dilute spectrum, because large energy intervals between the levels prevent

their collective mixture. In Na+

11 dipole states start above 1 eV and so are well separated

from the low-frequency quadrupole modes. Such a spectral separation is a general feature

of small deformed clusters. As was mentioned above and as can be seen from Table 1, the

FIG. 2: Dipole (λµ =10) and quadrupole (λµ =20) strength distributions in Na+

11. The large peaks

above 2 eV represent the states of the dipole and quadrupole plasmons. The sets of horizontal

arrows depict two-photon (two-dipole) processes: DTP (pump + pump) and ORSR (pump +

Stokes). The latter runs via the isolated dipole state at 1.35 eV and the tail of the dipole plasmon.

The low- and high-frequency quadrupole states of interest are seen as peaks at 0.8 and 2.6 eV.

low-frequency quadrupole modes are represented by the 1eh transitions inside the valence

shell (∆N = 0). Moreover, most of these modes arise due to the deformation splitting of

the levels and so their energy scale is small. Instead, the dipole modes are generated by

∆N = 1 electron-hole transitions between the neighbor quantum shells and thus acquire

much higher energies. The eﬀective energy separation of the quadrupole and dipole modes

favors discrimination of the low-frequency quadrupole spectrum.

In what follows, we will concentrate on the states with λµ=20. This suﬃces for our

exploration. Besides, the limitation to λµ=20 allows to maintain the axial symmetry which,

in turn, reduces computational expense. Figure 2 shows the relevant part of the excitation

spectrum in terms of the dipole (λµ = 10) and quadrupole (λµ = 20) photo-absorption

strengths. The low- and high-frequency quadrupole modes of interest are seen at the energies

e20 =0.8 and 2.6 eV. The horizontal arrows depict the DTP and ORSR processes considered

below. Two ORSR versions are discussed. In the ﬁrst case, the process runs via the isolated

dipole state at 1.35 eV. In the second case, it proceeds via the intermediate region between

the isolated dipole state at 1.9 eV and the dipole plasmon.

In both cases, there is an

appreciable detuning from the dipole states such that one deals only with remote tails of

the states.

and dipole strengths as function of the excitation energy. The right panels display the electronic

quadrupole and dipole moments (in atomic units) as a function of time.

It is seen that, while

the quadrupole oscillation is persistent, (right-top plot), the dipole signal exists only during the

coinciding pump and Stokes pulses (right-bottom plot). The calculations were performed for laser

frequencies ~ωs =0.46 eV and ~ωp =1.27 eV, intensities Is = 1.5Ip = 2.2 · 1010W/cm2 and pulse

durations Ts = Tp = 300 fs. The detuning from the intermediate state is ∆ ∼0.08 eV.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. ORSR for low-frequency isolated quadrupole

Figure 3 shows the ORSR via the isolated dipole state at 1.35 eV with a detuning of

∆ ∼0.08 eV. The right panels show time evolution of the dipole and quadrupole moments.

It is seen that the ORSR mechanism leads to enduring quadrupole oscillation. Since electron-

ion and electron-electron relaxations are not taken into account here, these oscillations per-

sist for several ps and further. The dipole oscillations, on the other hand, exist only during

the pulses at t = 0−300 fs. The left panels display the corresponding dipole and quadrupole

strengths in the frequency domain, obtained as the Fourier transforms of the oscillating

moments. The quadrupole mode of interest at 0.81 eV dominates all other quadrupole ex-

citations, even the quadrupole plasmon. So, just this mode is presented in the enduring

1.44 · 1010W/cm2 and pulse durations Ts = Tp = 300 fs. The detuning is ∆ ∼0.15 eV with respect

oscillation seen in the right-top panel. The dipole strength is negligible (compare diﬀer-

ent scales of the top and bottom panels) and so should not noticeably compete with the

quadrupole mode of interest. As was shown in [10], a signiﬁcant decoupling of competing

modes is crucial for detection of the target quadrupole state.

Figure 4 shows results for the ORSR via the region between two close dipole structures.

The pump laser frequency 2.05 eV is placed between the isolated peak 1eh at 1.9 eV and the

tail of the dipole plasmon lying at 2.3 eV, thus representing a considerable detuning from

both dipole structures. As these structures are much stronger than the intermediate dipole

in the previous case, it becomes possible to get twice larger quadrupole signal even at the

lower laser intensity (Is = 1.5Ip = 1.44 · 1010W/cm2 against Is = 1.5Ip = 2.2 · 1010W/cm2

in ﬁgure 3). Like in the previous case, we have no appreciable competitors though now the

pump frequency is rather close to the dipole plasmon. Altogether, ﬁgures 3 and 4 justify

that one can get robust ORSR signals in clusters via both isolated dipole states and tail of

the dipole plasmon.

One may observe in the right-up panel of ﬁgure 4 that the quadrupole oscillation leads to

some shift of the average quadrupole moment. Indeed, the oscillation starts at the moment

0. Our analysis shows
that this eﬀect is caused by a non-isotropic emission of electrons from the cluster. Indeed,
the axial cluster Na+

11 has a shape of the prolate ellipsoid. The quadrupole oscillation of

multipolarity λµ = 20 drives electrons along the symmetry axis of the cluster and thus

favors emission of electrons from the poles of the cluster ellipsoid. This makes the shape

of the electron subsystem more spherical and therefore eﬀectively decreases the quadrupole

moment. The stronger the oscillation, the larger the moment shift. Hence the eﬀect is most

apparent in ﬁgure 4 which exhibits the strongest quadrupole mode. However, even in this

case the moment shift is quite modest ( 2%) and thus should not noticeably inﬂuence the

accuracy of measurements of the energy of the quadrupole mode in ORSR experiments.

B. Coherence and population for the target state

Figures 3 and 4 were obtained with simultaneously active pump and Stokes pulses, i.e.

with the relative time shift Tshift = 0. The dependence of the quadrupole peak height on

the time shift it shown in ﬁgure 5.

It is seen that the maximal quadrupole strength is

achieved at coincident pump and Stokes pulses. A similar picture emerges for stimulated

Raman scattering, when plotting the population of the state instead of its strength [11, 12,

13]. However, such a correlation between the strength and population arises only at low

10

population and does not imply equality of these two characteristics. This point deserves a

closer inspection.

Let us conﬁne the formal considerations to the active subspace. At any time t, the

many-body wave function of the three-level Λ system can be represented as a superposition

ψ(t) = c0(t)|0i + c1(t)|1i + c2(t)|2i

(1)

where c0(t), c1(t) and c2(t) are time-dependent amplitudes of the initial, intermediate and

ﬁnal bare states, respectively. The population of the target quadrupole state then reads

|c2(t)|2. But the strength of the quadrupole transition (considered in ﬁgures 3-5) is ∼
c0(t)∗c2(t)h2|E2|0i2 and so corresponds not to the population but to the coherence c0(t)∗c2(t)

of the initial and target states. The population and coherence have diﬀerent behaviors. They

both grow at the onset of the population of the level |2i but then the coherence gets the
2(t) = 0.5 and begins to vanish with further increasing |c2(t)|2 from

maximum at c2

0(t) = c2

0.5 to 1.

The calculation of the population |c2(t)|2 in TDLDA is somewhat involved. So, in the

present study, we will only consider a simple estimate. We know that the dominant compo-

nent of the low-frequency quadrupole state is the 1eh conﬁguration [200]e[220]h (see Table

1). To populate this conﬁguration, the electron from the occupied state [220] should be

transferred to the unoccupied state [200]. This should manifest itself in the time dependent

single-particle wave function φ[220](~r, t). Namely, it has to coincide with the initial state
¯φ[220](~r) at t=0 and then acquire large contribution of ¯φ[200](~r) in the course of time. Hence
the population P eh

2 (t) of the [200]e[220]h quadrupole component can be estimated as the

squared overlap

P eh

2 (t) = |

Z

d~rφ[220](~r, t) ¯φ[200](~r)|2.

This estimate yields for t > 600 fs (i.e. for the time when, following ﬁgures 3 and 4, only the

low-lying quadrupole mode survives) quite small population 0.01-0.03. Instead, the overlap

with the initial static state

the direct two-photon (DTP) excitation of the quadrupole, described in [10]. During the

time evolution, the single-electron wave functions thus mainly keep their initial structure

and only a small fraction (a few per cent) of the intended 1eh quadrupole conﬁguration

[200]e[220]h is really populated. This is mainly the consequence of using the large detuning.

One might be tempted to decreasing the detuning or, alternatively, enhance the population

by increasing the laser intensity. But then we would run into the on-linear regime of TDLDA

where the cross coupling between numerous states of the system takes place and hence the

three-level picture most probably fails. This trouble reﬂects the more complex dynamics

of metal clusters as compared to simple molecules. In any case, even the population of a

few percent has to be suﬃcient to detect the quadrupole state in experiment. The TDLDA

calculations for the DTP in Na+

11 showed measurable signatures of the low-lying quadrupole

state in PES [10]. A similar situation is expected for the ORSR.

C. ORSR stability

It is still necessary to check the stability of the ORSR scheme to variations of the process

parameters. Our tests are illustrated in ﬁgure 6. It shows ORSR via the isolated dipole.

12

The process via the tail of the dipole plasmon (not shown here) produces the same features.

The panels a) of ﬁgure 6 show the quadrupole and dipole strengths at larger pulse intensi-

ties. The intensities are increased by a factor 3.4 as compared to ﬁgure 3. This allows to get

a twice stronger quadrupole mode at 0.81 eV. However, we are punished by stronger dipole

excitations and a coupling to the quadrupole mode at 2.8 eV (as a part of the quadrupole

plasmon), which can complicate discrimination of the target state in PES. So, though the

ORSR works even at high intensities, the lower intensities are better suited for the experi-

mental analysis. On the other hand, it is not worth to go below the optimal intensities of

ﬁgure 3 since this would lead to an unnecessary weakening the quadrupole strength.

The panels b) in ﬁgure 6 show that small deviations from the two-photon resonance

condition ωp − ωs = ω2 lead to weakening of the target mode. Nevertheless, because of the

ﬁnite width of the mode, the signal does not vanish too rapidly. In fact the width of the

mode determines the maximal deviation for ωs while looking for the mode in the experiment.

Finally, the panels c) of the ﬁgure demonstrate what happens without detuning from

the intermediate dipole state. In this case, the dipole strength of the intermediate state is

considerably increased while the population of the target quadrupole state shrinks. Besides

that, a large fraction of competing high-frequency quadrupoles appear. So, a considerable

detuning is crucial for the success of the ORSR scheme.

D. DTP exploration of quadrupole plasmon

The top panel of ﬁgure 6c deserves a deeper analysis because it demonstrates an important

feature of ORSR and similar two-photon processes in metal clusters. Indeed, if two photons

from the pump and/or Stokes pulses happen to come into resonance with one of the peaks

of the quadrupole plasmon, then this peak is strongly excited. Such a case is observed in
the top panel of ﬁgure 6c). Comparison of this plot with Fig. 2 shows that 2~ωp = 2.7 eV
and 2~ωp + 2ωs = 3.7 eV: this approximately covers two of the plasmon states and thus

result in two prominent pikes at these energies. Obviously, such undesirable excitation of

the quadrupole plasmon can spoil the discrimination of low-frequency quadrupole modes in

PES. At the same time, this provides new possibilities for simultaneous investigation of low-

and high-frequency quadrupoles.

The example above indicates that implementation of two lasers with diﬀerent frequencies

complicates the analysis of the quadrupole plasmon because we may have at once more

than one resonance. This would hinder the detection procedure. For the same reason

is not optimal to use for investigation of high-frequency states the ORSR in the ladder

conﬁguration.

It is much better to apply the DTP method proposed in [10], where the

quadrupole state of interest is populated by absorption of two photons from one laser, as

shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2. An example of such a DTP process is presented in ﬁgure 7 where

the resonant absorption of two photons from the pump laser results in a strong excitation of

the quadrupole plasmon state at 2.6 eV. Unlike the top panel of Fig. 6c), only one frequency

is involved and thus only one resonant peak excited. A properly tuned DTP with scanning

frequencies allows to investigate the quadrupole plasmon state by state.

E. Proposed experiment

The discussion above shows that the most optimal way is a simultaneous investigation

of the low- and high-frequency quadrupole states by a combination of ORSR and DTP

methods, respectively. For this aim we need three synchronized lasers: tunable infrared

pump and Stokes lasers and ultraviolet probe laser.

The detection scheme can be the same as proposed in [10]. Namely, the cluster is irra-

diated by a probe pulse (with an appropriate delay) leading to a direct emission of electron

out of the excited quadrupole state. The coupling of the quadrupole oscillation to the single-

electron PES structures will create the satellites in the PES. Thus, by recording the PES

and measuring the relative frequencies of the satellites, one may determine the frequency of

the quadrupole state.

The experiment should follow three steps.

1) As a ﬁrst step, we should ﬁnd the optimal parameters (intensity, duration, ...) for the

probe pulse responsible for the photoionization of the cluster and detection process. For this

aim we should scan the pulse parameters so as to get the strongest and, at the same time,

distinct single-particle PES from the ground state. Our predictions [10] for the optimal pulse

intensities and durations (I = 2 · 1010 − 2 · 1011W/cm2 and T = 200 − 500 fs) can be used

here as a ﬁrst guess. These predictions are relevant for all three pulses (pump, Stokes and

probe) which may have similar characteristics, apart from the photon frequency.

In principle, the photoionization can be also provided by the coherent synchrotron source

with high-frequency photons. Then the two-photon ionization proposed in [10] can be re-

placed by more eﬀective one-photon ionization. In this case, the characteristics of the pump

and Stokes pulses can be taken again from [10], while the parameters of the probe irradiation

need an independent adjusting.

2) Now we can proceed with the next step: to explore the high-frequency states of the

quadrupole plasmon. We use here only the pump and probe lasers. The pump frequency

is scanned until its double value comes into resonance with the states of the quadrupole

plasmon. The probe pulse should have suﬃcient delay with respect to the pump pulse so

as to be safely decoupled from it and to measure self-sustaining oscillations only. Since the

quadrupole plasmon has high energy, one-photon ionization by a probe laser in the visible

range suﬃces for our aims. The maximum satellite signal provides the quadrupole energy in

two ways, ﬁrst as the double pump frequency and second (as a countercheck) from the oﬀset

of the satellites. Thus one can explore, state by state, all the quadrupole plasmon [26].

3) In a ﬁnal step, one can reﬁne the measurement of the low-frequency quadrupole state.

First, one should choose the optimal intermediate dipole frequency by combining a suitable

15

detuning above or below the dipole state with the feature that the double pump frequency

lies between the peaks of the quadrupole plasmon and thus avoid their resonance excitation.

By such a way we will hopefully minimize the inﬂuence of the quadrupole plasmon. Then

one should scan the Stokes laser until the two-photon resonance ωp − ωs = ω2 with a low-

frequency quadrupole is achieved.

The proposed scheme allows to obtain not only the frequencies of the quadrupole states

but also their lifetime. To that end, one should simply increase, step by step, the delay

between the pump and probe pulses. The relaxation of quadrupole oscillation will ﬁnally

lead to an extinction of the satellites from which one can read oﬀ the lifetime.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we have proposed a combined exploration of electronic quadrupole low-

frequency (infrared region) and high-frequency (region of the quadrupole plasmon) states in

free metal clusters by means of two-photon processes: direct two-photon (DTP) excitation

and oﬀ-resonant stimulated Raman (ORSR) scattering. The DTP uses one pump laser and

retrieves the two photons from it while the ORSR employs a pump and a Stokes pulses

with diﬀerent frequencies. The ﬁnal proof of the successful excitation of a quadrupole mode

is achieved by a probe pulse with a subsequent measurement of the photo-electron spectra

(PES). The present analysis is based on realistic simulations within the time-dependent local

density approximation. The main attention is paid to the ORSR which, for our knowledge,

still have never been considered for atomic clusters.

The calculations show that the high-frequency quadrupole states in the regime of the

quadrupole plasmon are preferably explored by DTP. The more ﬂexible ORSR is a powerful

tool to investigate the isolated low-frequency (infrared) quadrupoles. ORSR allows to use

various intermediate dipole states, from the isolated infrared dipoles to the dipole plasmon.

In all the cases, an appreciable detuning from true dipole states is crucial to avoid unwanted

cross talk. A proper combination of both methods (DTP, ORSR) should allow to explore

both spectra and lifetimes of the quadrupole states. We have worked out optimal param-

eters of DTP and ORSR schemes and checked the sensitivity of the schemes to parameter

variations. The proposed two-photon schemes are quite general and, in principle, can be

used for a variety of clusters including supported and embedded ones.

16

The low- and high-frequency quadrupole states can deliver important information on

electron-hole excitations inside the valence shell (∆N = 0) and through two shells (∆N =

2). By combining the two-photon and photoelectron data, one can get the single-electron

energies above the Fermi level and thus greatly enlarge our knowledge on the mean ﬁeld

spectra of valence electrons. These spectra give access to other cluster features (mean ﬁeld,

deformation) and provide a critical test for the theory of cluster structure.

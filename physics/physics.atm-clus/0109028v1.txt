We investigate the statics and dynamics of spatial phase segregation process of a mixture of
fermion atoms in a harmonic trap using the density functional theory. The kinetic energy of the
fermion gas is written in terms of the density and its gradients. Several cases have been studied by
neglecting the gradient terms (the Thomas-Fermi limit) which are then compared with the Monte-
Carlo results using the full gradient corrected kinetic energy. A linear instability analysis has been
performed using the random-phase approximation. Near the onset of instability, the fastest unstable
mode for spinodal decomposition is found to occur at q = 0. However, in the strong coupling limit,
many more modes with q ≈ KF decay with comparable time scales.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent realizations of two1,2 and three3 component alkali Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC’s) in a trap provide us
with new systems to explore the physics in otherwise unachievable parameter regimes.4,5,6. Dramatic results have
recently been observed in the phase segregation dynamics of mixtures of Rb1,2 and Na3 gases. Periodic spatial
structures were found at intermediate times which then recombine at a later time.

Phase segregation phenomena have been much studied in materials science and these can be understood using clas-
sical mechanics. Spatial modulations have also been observed, for example, in AlNiCo alloys.7 These were explained
in terms of a concept called spinodal decomposition.8 When a system is quenched from the homogeneous phase into a
broken-symmetry phase, the ordered phase does not order instantaneously. Instead, diﬀerent length scales set in as the
domains form and grow with time. For the BEC’s, however, quantum mechanics play an important role. It has been
shown9 that it is possible to have an analogous spinodal decomposition, which manifests some of the phenomenology
including a periodic spatial structure at an intermediate time that is now determined by quantum mechanics. The
time scale provides for a self-consistent check of the theory and is consistent with the experimental results.2 The
growth of domains at later times is now determined by quantum tunneling and not by classical diﬀusion.

Recently, it became possible10 to cool a single component system of about a million 40K fermionic atoms in a
magnetic trap below the Fermi temperature, TF , leading to the realization of a spin-polarized fermion gas of atoms.
Similar to electrons in a solid, the dilute gas of atoms ﬁlls all the lowest energy states below the Fermi energy, EF .
The transition to this quantum degenerate state is gradual as compared to the abrupt phase transition into a Bose
condensate. For single component fermionic systems, however, the equilibrium is diﬃcult to achieve as the s-wave
elastic collisions are prohibited due to Pauli exclusion principle. In the experiments of DeMarco and Jin10, this was
circumvented by using a mixture of two nuclear spin states of 40K atoms for which s-wave collisions are allowed.
One of the manifestations of quantum mechanics was the nature of momentum distribution which diﬀered from the
well known classical gaussian distribution. This system corresponds to the weak coupling limit in which the physical
properties are close to those of a non-interacting fermion gas. The other system which is being explored11 is the
gas of 6Li atoms. Mixtures of fermions interating with the Coulomb interaction have been studied in the context
of the electron-hole ﬂuids12. For fermions mixtures on a lattice site interacting with the Hubbard Hamiltonian, the
partial phase segregation leads to antiferromagnetism. Thermodynamic properties as well as density and momentum
distributions of spin-polarized fermionic gas of atoms in a harmonic trap have been studied in recent years13,14,15. Butts
and Rokhsar13 have obtained universal forms of the spatial and momentum distributions for a single component spin-
polarized non-interacting fermion gas using the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation, whereas Schneider and Wallis15
have studied the eﬀects of shell closure for small number of atoms, similar to the nuclear shell model. Bruun and
Burnett14 have studied an interacting fermion gas of 6Li atoms which have a large negative scattering length. Such an
interaction could also lead to the possibility of superﬂuid state16 in these systems. In the present paper, we consider
mixtures of these new ﬁnite systems of ultracold fermionic atoms with a positive scattering length in the limit of both
weak and strong coupling and explore the equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum statistical physics using the TF
approximation, Monte Carlo simulations, and the random phase approximation.

In section II we present the equilibrium static properties of mixtures of fermionic atoms in diﬀerent parameters
regimes using both the TF and the Monte Carlo simulations. In section III, we study the dynamics of phase segregation
of such mixtures using a linear stability analysis. Finally, conclusions will be presented in section IV.

II. STATICS

We ﬁrst start with the statics of a two component fermion gas of atoms with masses m1 and m2 and particle
numbers N1 and N2. This is assumed to be conﬁned in an azimuthally symmetric harmonic trap with radial and axial
frequencies ω and λω, respectively which are considered to be the same for both the components. Unlike the electron
gas in matter, the fermion gas of atoms is neutral and dilute. Therefore, signiﬁcant interactions between atoms are
only short-ranged and that would be responsible for any phase segregation in the system. In the long wavelength
limit, the system can be well described by the density functional theory and the total energy can be written as

E =

[

E0σ(ρσ) + gρ1(r)ρ2(r)]dr.

Here E0σ = ¯h
2 mσω2(x2 + y2 + λ2z2)ρσ(r) is the non-interacting part of the energy density and ρσ(r) is
ρσ(r)dr = Nσ. The interaction term has been approximated by
the particle density of the component σ = 1, 2 with
r′). g is related to the scattering length a by g = 2π¯h2a/ ¯m, with ¯m = m1m2/(m1 + m2).
the contact potential gδ(r
In accordance with the experiments, we take a to be positive and consider only the s-wave scattering. Therefore, the
contribution to the interaction term is non-zero only when the species are diﬀerent or are in diﬀerent hyperﬁne states
as in experiments. From the Pauli exclusion principle, there is no contact interaction between particles of the same
species (spin). In a more general treatment including p-wave scattering there would be additional terms involving
interaction between identical species also. But these are small, and thus neglected.

The ﬁrst term represents the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation to the kinetic energy. The second term is 1

√ρσ |
and represents the gradient correction to the kinetic energy. The integral of the third term extended to inﬁnity vanishes,
and thus it will not be included in the calculations. The Monte-Carlo results conﬁrm that the gradient term is at
least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the TF term, but this term is important in that it can break the symmetry
of the ground state and lead to asymmetric states with a lower energy .

Without the interaction term in (1), the system behaves in the same fashion as the one component system for
which Butts and Rokhsar13 obtained EF to be related to the total particle number N by EF = ¯hω(6λN )1/3. Deﬁning
RF = (2EF /mω2)1/2 (giving the characteristic size of the gas), and KF = (2mEF /¯h2)1/2 (momentum of a free
particle of energy EF ), they calculated the density proﬁle at T=0 to be given by

We now examine the properties of the mixed (two-component) interacting system and will show how the repulsive
interaction modiﬁes this non-interacting density proﬁle as well as other properties of the system. The strength of the
coupling, which controls the phase segregation, depends on the dimensionless parameter which is the ratio between
2
the interaction and the kinetic energies, namely gρ1ρ2/[ 3¯h
2 /m2)]. In the simple case of equal
masses (m1 = m2 = m) and densities (ρ1 = ρ2 = ρ) of the two components, this simply scales as aKF . This means
that the coupling would be stronger if a or the density is large. Also as EF is proportional to the frequency of the trap
at constant N (a higher frequency leads to a larger separation between the levels), the coupling would be large for
higher frequencies. From now on, to measure the strength of the interaction, we will use the dimensionless parameters
cσ = KF σ a/π, where KF σ = (2mσµσ)1/2/¯h , or in the case of equal chemical potentials, just c = KF a/π.

We see that the eﬀect of the additional
(without necessarily leading to a phase segregation).

Gσn¯σ term, i.e. the interaction, is to deplete the regions where n¯σ is highest
When there is phase segregation, the interface energy is proportional to the square root of the coeﬃcient of the
gradient term17 and it often serves to distinguish diﬀerent conﬁgurations. In that case, their eﬀect cannot be neglected
and these are included in the Monte Carlo simulations. We next discuss some special cases in the TF limit.

A. TF limit: Similar densities: (µ1 = µ2) for any coupling

To simplify the notations, we will use: µ1 = µ2 = µ; R1 = R2 = R;

. In this case, three solutions
to Eq. (6) will correspond to n1 = n2, of which only one is physical with n1 > 0. If a solution n2 = f (n1) exists,
= n2 can be obtained numerically.
by symmetry, the other one is necessarily n1 = f (n2). These solutions with n1
The real solutions are plotted in Fig. 1, where the n1 = n2 solution is referred to as “Sym”, and the other conjugate
(asymmetric) solutions are referred to as “A1” and “A2”. Below we discuss these solutions in the weak and strong
coupling limits.

C. TF limit: linear instability analysis

We next study the ﬂuctuations of the system about its equilibrium conﬁguration in the TF limit by expanding
the thermodynamic potential Ω upto second order in the particle density variation δρ about its minimum which was
computed above. The sign of the second derivative of Ω will decide the stability of the symmetric phase. A phase
segregation occurs when the Hessian (second derivative matrix) ceases to be positive deﬁnite. If the transition is ﬁrst
order, it would have already occurred before reaching a negative second derivative. The second derivative from Eqs.
(3) and (4) is just a 2

Similar to the electron gas which has several kinds of instabilities such as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism,

It is clear from the above equations that if a = 0 then ρσq = 0 is a solution (uniform density if no coupling). For
a > 0, we have ρσq and ρ¯σq of opposite signs for all q. This means that there is phase segregation for repulsive
couplings. Furthermore, if a < 0, there will be density modulation in the small q limit (the functional we considered
is valid in the long wavelength limit). We shall return to this point in section III where the dynamics are treated.

One can also note that the transition points of Eq. 16 and previously studied Eq. 6 are the same (in the ω = 0 and
µ1 = µ2 case), since they are derived from the same functional. Indeed from the positive-deﬁniteness of the functional
Ω in this representation, one obtains that the transition occurs for ¯kσa/π = 1/2. Inserting this critical value into
Eq. 16, one ﬁnds the relation between the non-interacting Fermi wavevector KF and the interacting one ¯kσ at the
transition point: KF = ¯kσ

E. General case: Monte Carlo results

The density distribution that extremizes the energy functional in Eq.

(1) can be obtained by a Monte Carlo
E/T ) for a parameter T that is suﬃciently low. This is basically the
simulation with a weighting factor exp(
simulated annealing method and has been exploited successfully in earlier treatment6 of the corresponding Bose
system described by a Gross-Pitaevski functional.

−

We approximate the volume integral of the energy functional by a discrete sum. Using the scaled radius ¯r, we
sample a lattice inside a sphere of diameter 2R consisting of 40 sites along the diameter, making a total of 33398 sites.
The derivative term is approximated by a ﬁnite diﬀerence. For simplicity, we show here results for the case when the
two components have the same mass.

We ﬁrst show in Fig. 2 the density proﬁle of component 1 as a function of x and y for z=0 for the weak coupling case

In the limit of strong interaction, phase segregation starts, and as mentioned earlier, the system can now also break
cylindrical symmetry. This happens when KF a is large enough, which in turn can be achieved with only large KF ,
only large a, or both. To illustrate this, we show in Fig. 3 the density proﬁles for components 1 and 2 for the case of
10−30J, and ω = 300 rad/sec. In this case, c = KF a/π = 2.39,

It is to be further noted that for this case, the density distribution is still quite cylindrical but there is a slight
asymmetry, as we can see from the graph of the diﬀerence. This asymmetry becomes more pronounced as the

The density of component 2 is small and therefore, its noise is also substantially higher. One can clearly see the

density depletion of component 2 at the center.

III. DYNAMICS

We next turn our attention to the issue of dynamics. For the classical and boson spinodal decompositions, the
fastest unstable mode occurs at a ﬁnite wave vector. We ask if a similar situation occurs for the fermion case. We
found that the fastest unstable mode occurs at wavevector q = 0 at the onset of instability. For stronger coupling,
many modes with q
KF decay with comparable time scales. We now describe the details of this linear stability
analysis.

∼

The energy functional (Eq. (1)) which was approximated with a local kinetic energy depending on the density and
its derivatives is only good in the long wavelength limit. Due to this approximation, we found that the instability has
a local character and occurs ﬁrst in regions of high density. Here we will perform a linear instability analysis in the
random phase approximation (RPA) to improve upon this local picture. The linear susceptibility χ is deﬁned as the
response of the particle density to an external potential V which could also be σ-dependent:

Here V tot is the total self-consistent ﬁeld and is the sum of the external ﬁeld and that due to the interaction:
σ = Vσ + gδρ¯σ. The bare response χσσ can be obtained from the usual Lindhard expression18. Since there is

The ﬁrst mode corresponds to a density ﬂuctuation, and the second mode δρ1
δρ2 represents the phase separation
instability in which we are interested. The response corresponding to this mode is given by ǫ(q, w) = [1 + gχ(q, w)].
The instability decay time ν−1 is determined from the formula ǫ(q, iν) = 0, since, in this case, any inﬁnitesimal
external potential will lead to a large change in the density. There exists a q = q0 such that ν(q0) is largest. This
determines the spinodal wavevector of the fermionic system as it indicates the mode with fastest growth. In what
follows, we will be treating the constant external potential problem where the Fermi momentum is ¯k. For the conﬁned
case, one can consider ¯k to be a local function related to the density by ¯k(r) = [6π2ρ(r)]1/3. From the Lindhard
expression18 for χ (real frequencies), we obtain, after correcting for a spin degeneracy factor of 2, the corresponding
dimensionless response ¯χ =

The equation ǫ(q, w) = [1

gχ(q, w)] = 0 implies that the instability points for phase segregation with a repulsive
interaction (g > 0) and that of density modulation with an attractive interaction are exactly the same within RPA.
This is also in agreement with the analysis of section II E where it was shown that ”magnetic” instability occurs for
repulsive interactions, and ”density wave” instability may occur for attractive interactions. Although the susceptibility
can be both negative or positive, for a coupling of ﬁxed sign, one should only consider the physically correct situation.
In our case, for positive g, only the “magnetic” instability, i.e. χ =

ǫ(q, iν) = 0 for ¯c < 0.5 and no instability develops. For larger values of ¯c, the plane z = 1/¯c intersects the surface of
¯χ on a curve which is displayed in Fig. 8. The inverse decay time ω as a function of the wavevector in units of ¯k is
shown in this ﬁgure. As can be seen, the fastest unstable mode occurs at wavevector q = 0 and ω = 0 at the onset
of the instability (¯c = 0.5) in agreement with Eq. 17 previously derived. Indeed the instability calculation derived in
the previous section focused on the long wavelength aspect of the problem.

In the really strong interaction limit, further phase separation can take place either via tunnelling19,20 or via

quantum motion of the domain walls. We hope to investigate this further in the future.

IV. CONCLUSION

In conclusion we have investigated the statics and dynamics of the spatial phase segregation process of a mixture
of fermion atoms in a harmonic trap using the density functional theory and the random phase approximation. As
the coupling starts to increase, even with the same chemical potential, equilibrium distribution with unequal densities
starts to appear, which quite often do not exhibit axially symmetric correlations. Similar to the classical and Bose
spinodal decomposition cases, the fastest mode for the initial phase segregation occurs at a ﬁnite wave-vector. The
condition of instability corresponds to a large interaction, which may be achieved experimentally with the atoms close
to a Feshbach resonance.

The instability calculation for the phase segregation phenomena discussed here is related to the instability calculation
for the antiferromagnetic transition of the electron gas. In the electron gas, this is enhanced when there is nesting of
Fermi surface such as in Cr or in one dimensional materials. The transition always stops after the 2KF instability
due to the long range nature of the Coulomb interaction, and no further “segregation” takes place.

An interesting situation is the one dimensional trap as it would exhibit a much stronger instability.

In mean
ﬁeld, the one dimensional density diﬀerence response function ǫ(2KF ) = 1/[1 + KF a Log(T /EF )] is logarithmically
divergent at zero temperature. The transition temperature occurs at Tc = EF e−1/KF a. One dimensional trap, which
can be realized for small values of λ, has been extensively studied3,10 and we expect a higher tendency towards phase
segregation in that case as well.

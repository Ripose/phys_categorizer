Linking Vibrational Dynamics to Local Electronic Structure:
Local Analysis of Dynamics of the relaxed Si87 Cluster

Lei Liu, C. S. Jayanthi, and Shi-Yu Wu

(Dated: August 8, 2013)

A ﬂexible scheme for decomposing the vibrational density of states in terms of pair vibrational
density of states is presented. This scheme provides the linkage between the site vibrational density
of states and pair vibrational density of states so that vibrational modes, in particular localized
modes, can be conveniently examined in terms of the correlation between the vibration at a given
site and those at its neighboring sites. Furthermore, within the framework of a total energy vi-
brational spectrum study, this scheme allows the analysis of vibrational modes in terms of their
electronic origin. A case study of the vibrational dynamics of the relaxed Si87 cluster is carried
out to demonstrate the ﬂexibility of the scheme in analyzing the properties of vibrational modes,
particularly for complex systems with reduced or no symmetry.

INTRODUCTION

II. METHODS

In recent years,

total-energy-vibrational-spectrum
studies have been carried out for extended periodic sys-
tems as well as complex systems with reduced symmetry
because of the development of eﬃcient and reliable meth-
ods of calculating the total energy[1, 2, 3]. These stud-
ies start with the calculation of the total energy using
semi-empirical tight-binding (TB) approaches[1] or ﬁrst
principles methods[2, 3] such as those based on the den-
sity functional theory (DFT). The force constant matrix
between a pair of atoms are then calculated as the appro-
priate second partial derivatives of the total energy with
respect to the displacements of the atoms about their
equilibrium positions. While it is indeed more satisfying
to calculate the vibrational properties using force con-
stant matrices determined from the total energy based
on quantum mechanical calculations rather than from
empirically-ﬁtted classical potential, a key advantage of
the total energy approaches over the approaches based
on the classical potentials is that the former allows the
possibility of linking the interesting dynamical features,
in particular vibrational modes associated with surfaces,
interfaces, defects, impuritites, etc., directly to the local
electronic structure. However, this issue has not yet been
systematically addressed. We present here a scheme that
provides a framework through which dynamic features of
a vibrating system can be related to the electronic struc-
ture. We also demonstrate the application of this scheme
using the vibration dynamics of the relaxed Si87 cluster
as the working example. We will show how all the in-
teresting dynamical features of the relaxed Si87 clusters
can be traced to their electronic origins, including the
local electronic structure such as bond charges, dangling
bonds, etc.

The dynamics of a system is described by the equation

the eigen-displacement of the λ-mode (with the eigen-
frequency ωλ) at site i along the α-direction. Tradi-
tionally, the vibrational density of states (VDOS) pro-
jected on sites (individual atoms) is the tool to analyze
the nature and properties of a defect or impurity mode.
This is usually accomplished by introducing the sum rule

is the local VDOS at site i along the α polarization. How-
ever, since the force ﬁeld characterizing a particular vi-
brational mode is determined by the interaction of the
atom at a given site with its neighbors, it is more illu-
minating if, in addition, the VDOS projected on pairs of
atoms is used in combination with the site VDOS to ana-
lyze the mode. The interactions of a certain atom with its
neighbors are described by the force constant matrices.

Thus a sum rule that involves the force constant matrices
would be an appropriate vehicle to construct the VDOS
projected onto pairs of atoms. Such a scheme can be set
up as follows.

In arriving at Eq. (5), the relation φiα,iβ =

tions. First, the summation of Eq. (5) over both i and α
leads to

This is precisely the sum rule needed to project the
VDOS onto pairs of atoms i and j as Eq. (6) also in-
volves the force constant matrix elements φiα,jβ . Thus,
when Eq. (6) is inserted into the deﬁning equation for
the VDOS (Eq. (2)), we obtain

The second useful function of Eq. (5) is that it provides
the framework to link the local VDOS at a particular
site to the interactions with its neighbors. In this way,
the vibrational mode localized in the vicinity of a given
site can be correlated with the vibrational motions of its
interacting neighbors. Thus, from Eqs. (4) and (8), we
have

ρiα(ω) = X
j6=i,β

ρiα,jβ (ω)

Equation (5) can also be rewritten as

Equation (13) allows the decomposition of the site VDOS
in terms of on-site as well as oﬀ-site contributions.

While the scheme based on Eq. (5) provides the ve-
hicle to decompose the VDOS in terms of contributions
from pairs of atoms directly interacting with each other
via φiα,jβ , one may also devise a scheme to project the
VDOS onto pairs of atoms interacting directly as well as
those not interacting directly. Such a scheme is useful for
examining collective (extended) as well as more localized
vibrational modes. To develop such a scheme, we note
that

Equations (5) through (23) provide some examples of
projecting the VDOS onto pairs of atom and relating
site VDOS to pair VDOS for the purpose of studying the
correlation between the vibrations at diﬀerent localities
for localized as well as more extended vibrational modes.
Within the framework of a total-energy-vibrational-
spectrum approach, the bonding conﬁgurations of atoms
in the system, such as the bond charges, the nature of
the bonds, and the number of bonds associated with each
atom, are already determined[6]. Therefore, it is straight-
forward to relate a particular vibrational mode to its elec-
tronic origin via either the site VDOS or the pair VDOS.
For example, the VDOS can be partitioned according to
the contributions from diﬀerent ranges of the total bond
charge qi = (1/2) Pj σij associated with the atom at site
i in the system where σij is the bond charge between the
pair of atoms i and j. This can be accomplished by sum-
ming the site VDOS ρi = Pα ρiα over those sites i where
qi falls within the range [a, b], i.e.,

ρ(ω; a

qi

≤

≤

b) = X

ρi(ω)

a≤qi≤b

(24)

Since the bond charge is closely related to the strength of
the bond, such a partitioning can shed light on whether
a particular mode is associated with the strengthening or
softening of the bonds. Similarly, the VDOS can also be
grouped in terms of contributions from atoms possessing
a certain number of bonds, namely

ρ(ω; ni = k) = X
ni=k

ρi(ω)

(25)

where ni denotes the number of bonds possessed by the
particle i. This presentation of the vibrational spectrum
provides the means to identify the modes associated with
dangling bonds and those associated with distorted bond-
ing conﬁgurations. To examine how an individual bond
aﬀects a particular mode, one may group the pair VDOSs
ρij = Pαβ ρiα,jβ according to the range of the bond
charge σij such that

ρ(ω; a

σij

≤

≤

b) = X

ρij (ω)

(26)

The characteristics of the bonds is usually described
by molecular orbitals such as τ = ssσ, spσ, ppσ, or ppπ.
To determine the nature of the bonds responsible for the

The VDOS can also be decomposed in terms of quan-
tities such as the distance, the bond charge, etc. via
¯ρiα,jβ , or ˆρiα,jβ or ˜ρiα,jα, following similar procedure as
described in Eq. (26). Thus, a very ﬂexible framework
that allows the convenient decomposition of the VDOS
to pair VDOS via ρiα,jβ , or ¯ρiα,jβ , or ˆρiα,jβ , or ˜ρiα,jα,
and the linking of the site VDOS to these pair VDOS (see
Eqs. (9), (13), (19), and (23)) can be set up. This frame-
work can then be proﬁtably used to analyze interesting
dynamical features of vibrations, in particular how these
features are correlated with the local electronic structure,
of complex systems with reduced or no symmetry.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To demonstrate the application of the scheme outlined
in Eqs. (5) to (27) to examine the properties of the vibra-
tional modes and to trace these modes to their electronic
origins, we use the dynamics of a relaxed Si87 as the work-
ing example. The initial conﬁguration of the cluster is an
87-atom tetrahedral network with an atom at the central
site. The x-, y-, and z-axis are along the cube edges of
the cube-unit cell with the central site at a corner of the
cell. The equilibrium conﬁguration of this cluster (see
Fig. 1) was ﬁrst determined by the MD scheme using
the non-orthogonal tight-binding Hamiltonian developed
by Mennon and Subbaswamy[7]. The force constant ma-
trices of the relaxed cluster were then numerically calcu-
lated from the total energy.

In Fig. 2, the VDOS of the relaxed cluster, together
with contributions to the VDOS from those sites with
the total bond charge in a certain range (see Eq. (24)),
is shown. We use the bonding conﬁguration of the bulk
Si as the reference to choose the ranges of the total bond
charge because Si-based systems favor the tetrahedral sp3
bonding conﬁguration.
In bulk Si, each Si atom con-
tributes 0.25e to one of the four equivalent bonds, giving
rise to a total bond charge of 1e for every atom. Thus, we
have selected the following four ranges, namely qi > 1e,
1e > qi > 0.8e, 0.8e > qi > 0.6e, and 0.6e > qi, to exam-
ine the eﬀect of relaxation on the bonding conﬁguration,
and hence on the vibrational spectrum of Si87. From Fig.
2, it can be seen that the majority of the contributions to
the VDOS originate from those sites with 1e > qi > 0.8e
or 0.8e > qi > 0.6e, indicating that the relaxation has
probably caused a general softening of the bonds and
thus resulting in an overall shift of the VDOS towards

lower frequencies compared to the bulk VDOS. Figure 2
also shows that the mode with the highest frequency is
a defect mode originating from the range qi > 1e, thus a
strengthened bonding conﬁguration, while the mode with
the lowest frequency originates from the range 0.6e > qi,
a softened bonding conﬁguration or a conﬁguration with
dangling bonds. In Fig. 3, the contribution to the VDOS
is decomposed according to the number of bonds associ-
ated with each atom (see Eq. (25)). The existence of a
bond between a pair of atoms is established by the cri-
terion σij > 0.04e rather than relying on the distance[6].
Figure. 3 shows that the majority of the contributions
still originate from atoms with 4 bonds, with a signif-
icant minority contribution from atoms with 3 bonds.
The defect mode at the highest frequency can be seen as
associated with an atom with 4 bonds. Together with the
evidence in Fig. 2, it can be concluded that this mode re-
sults from the strengthened bonding conﬁguration. The
lowest (non-zero) frequency mode, on the other hand, is
seen to originate from an atom with 2 bonds. The ev-
idences provided by Figs. 2 and 3 thus indicate that
this mode is a dangling-bond mode, but with remain-
ing bonds strengthened. To further explore this issue,
we present in Fig. 4 the decomposition of the VDOS in
terms of the ranges of bond charge σij (see Eq. (26)).
It can be seen that indeed both the highest- and the
lowest-frequency mode are associated with σij > 0.5e,
indicating that the bonds involved in these vibrations are
strengthened bonds (compared to the bulk bond). Figure
4 also shows that the majority of the contribution to the
VDOS come from the range 0.4e < σij < 0.5e, the range
with bond charge not too much deviated from the bulk
bonding conﬁguration, thus reinforcing the observation
provided by Figs. 2 and 3. Another interesting feature
in Fig. 4 is the negative contribution in the low frequency
VDOS from the range σij < 10−3e. The negative contri-
bution is an indication that for contributions to a certain
vibrational mode by pairs of atoms i and j interacting
via φiα,jβ , some of those with no chemical bond formed
between them may have the force constant too “soft” to
support the vibration at that frequency. In Fig. 5, we
show the decomposition of the VDOS in terms of bond-
ing types (see Eq.
It can be clearly seen that
the main contribution to all the vibrational modes comes
from ppσ-bonds, with a substantial minority contribu-
tion from spσ-bonds. The directional characteristics of
the ppσ-bonds indicates the dominance of the stretching
vibrations as is expected for a Si-based structure.

(27)).

Figure 6 presents the decomposition of the VDOS ac-
cording to the ranges of the distance between atoms via
ˆρiα,jβ (see Eqs. (18)). Since ˆρiα,jβ only involves cλ
iα and
cλ
jβ , it provides an useful vehicle to analyze contributions
to a certain vibrational mode from the on-site environ-
ment, pair of atoms directly interacting (via φiα,jβ ) with
each other, and pairs of atoms not directly interacting.
The three ranges of distances chosen for the decomposi-
tion in Fig. 6 correspond roughly to 1st nearest-neighbor
distances (rij < 3.10˚A), 2nd nearest-neighbor distances

4

(3.10˚A < rij < 4.15˚A), and 3rd nearest-neighbor dis-
tances and beyond (rij > 4.15˚A) respectively. Figure 6
shows that there are contributions to the VDOS from
all three ranges to most of the low- to intermediate-
frequency modes and the contributions are consistent
with the number of pairs of atoms in each range. This
is an indication that these modes are extended modes.
On the other hand, the dominant contribution to the
high-frequency modes mainly originates from the range
rij < 3.10˚A. Considering the fact that for any given
atom in the cluster, there are many more neighbors at
farther distances than close distances, the dominance of
the contribution to VDOS from rij < 3.10˚A for high-
frequency modes suggests that these modes are more lo-
calized. For example, the highest-frequency mode ap-
pears to be a localized mode as contributions to this
mode from second nearest neighbors and beyond are out-
weighted by the contribution from the nearest neighbors,
even though there are many more farther neighbors than
nearest neighbors for every atom in the cluster. The
inset of Fig. 6 shows in more detail the contributions
to the non-zero lowest-frequency mode. The dominant
contribution to this mode is apparently from the on-site
environment. To gain more insight to these two inter-
iα)2 for the mode
esting modes, one may ﬁrst plot Pα(cλ
ωλ as a function of site index i to determine where the
mode is localized and then decompose the site VDOS for
that site according to distances (1st-, 2nd-, etc., based
on Eqs. (8) and (9)) to shed light on the correlation be-
tween the vibration of the site and those of its neighbors.

The upper inset of Fig. 7 is the plot of Pα(cλ
highest-frequency mode ( 108 THz) as a function of the

diate neighborhood of site 1 (the central site). The main
panel of Fig. 7 shows the site VDOS ρ1 = Pα ρ1α(ω)
decomposed in terms of 1st-, 2nd-, etc., nearest-neighbor
distance using Eqs.
It can be seen that

the contribution to this mode is almost entirely from the
coupling of the central site (site 1) with its 4 nearest
neighbors.
In the lower inset of Fig. 7, the nature of
the coupling is examined by decomposing ρ1 in terms of
Pj6=1 ρ1α,jβ . It is seen that the majority of the contribu-
tion are from xx-, yy-, and zz-nearest neighbor coupling.
It is also seen that the mode is actually a composite of
three almost degenerate modes (107.2, 108.0, and 107.5
THz), an indication of the distortion of the immediate
environment of the central site from the perfect tetrahe-
dral conﬁguration.

The analysis of the non-zero lowest-frequency mode is
shown in Fig. 8. The upper inset shows that the mode is
an on-site mode at site 82 located on the surface of the
cluster (see Fig. 1). The site VDOS ρ82, decomposed
according to Eq. (13), conﬁrms this picture. The lower
inset of Fig. 8 is the decomposition of ρ82 according to
Eq. (13) so that the on-site coupling can be examined.
It shows that two almost equivalent on-site xy- and yx-
coupling are the main contributors to this mode, indicat-
ing that this is mainly a wagging mode in the xy plane

anchored by the two strengthened bonds of the atom at
site 82 (a site with two dangling bonds, see Fig. 1).

and the analysis of vibrational dynamics of complex sys-
tems with low or no symmetry.

The relaxed Si87 cluster is a system with no symme-
try. The demonstration discussed in this section shows
the ﬂexibility of the methodologies developed in Sec. II
to carry out detailed analysis of the dynamics of such
a system and to trace interesting dynamical features to
their electronic origin. Hence the framework described in
Sec. II is expected to be extremely useful for the study

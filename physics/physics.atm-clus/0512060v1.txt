Abstract

We propose a practicable method for describing linear dynamics of diﬀerent ﬁnite Fermi sys-

tems. The method is based on a general self-consistent procedure for factorization of the two-body

residual interaction. It is relevant for diverse density- and current-dependent functionals and, in

fact, represents the self-consistent separable random-phase approximation (RPA), hence the name

SRPA. SRPA allows to avoid diagonalization of high-rank RPA matrices and thus dwarfs the calcu-

lation expense. Besides, SRPA expressions have a transparent analytical form and so the method

is very convenient for the analysis and treatment of the obtained results. SRPA demonstrates high

numerical accuracy. It is very general and can be applied to diverse systems. Two very diﬀerent

cases, the Kohn-Sham functional for atomic clusters and Skyrme functional for atomic nuclei, are

considered in detail as particular examples. SRPA treats both time-even and time-odd dynamical

variables and, in this connection, we discuss the origin and properties of time-odd currents and

densities in initial functionals. Finally, SRPA is compared with other self-consistent approaches

for the excited states, including the coupled-cluster method.

INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent local-density-approximation theory (TDLDA) is widely used for

description of dynamics of diverse quantum systems such as atomic nuclei, atoms and

molecules, atomic clusters, etc.

(see for more details [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). However, even in

the linear regime, this theory is plagued by dealing with high-rank matrices which make the

computational eﬀort too expensive. This is especially the case for non-spherical systems with

their demanding conﬁguration space. For example, in the Random Phase Approximation

(RPA), a typical TDLDA theory for linear dynamics, the rank of the matrices is determined

by the size of the particle-hole 1ph space which becomes really huge for deformed and heavy

spherical systems. The simplest RPA versions, like the sum rule approach and local RPA

(see hierarchy of RPA methods in [6]) deal with a few collective variables instead of a full

1ph space and thus avoid the problem of high-rank matrices. But these versions cannot

properly describe gross-structure of collective modes and the related property of the Landau

damping (dissipation of the collective motion over nearby 1ph excitations).

In this connection, we propose a method [7, 8, 9, 10] which combines accuracy and

power of involved RPA versions with simplicity and physical transparency of the simplest

ones and thus is a good compromise between these two extremes. The method is based

on the self-consistent separable approximation for the two-body residual interaction which

is factorized into a sum of weighted products of one-body operators. Hence the method is

called as separable RPA (SRPA). It should be emphasized that the factorization is self-

consistent and thus does not result in any additional parameters. Expressions for the one-

body operators and their weights are inambiguously derived from the initial functional. The

factorization has the advantage to shrink dramatically the rank of RPA matrix (usually

from r = 103

106 to r = 2

14) and thus to minimize the calculation expense. Rank

−

−

of SRPA matrix is determined by the number of the separable terms in the expansion for

the two-body interaction. Due to eﬀective self-consistent procedure, usually a few separable

terms (or even one term) are enough for a good accuracy. Ability of SRPA to minimize the

computational eﬀort becomes really decisive in the case of non-spherical systems with its

huge 1ph conﬁguration space. SRPA formalism is quite simple and physically transparent,

which makes the method very convenient for the analysis and treatment of the numerical

results. Being self-consistent, SRPA allows to extract spurious admixtures connected with

2

violation of the translational or rotational invariance. As is shown below, SRPA exhibits

accuracy of most involved RPA versions but for the much less expense. Since SRPA exploits

the full 1ph space, it equally well treats collective and non-collective states and, what is

very important, fully describes the Landau damping, one of the most important properties

of collective motion. SRPA is quite general and can be applied to diverse ﬁnite Fermi

systems (and thus to diﬀerent functionals), including those tackling both time-even densities

and time-odd currents. The latter is important not only for nuclear Skyrme functionals

[11, 12] which exploits a variety of time-even and time-odd variables but also for electronic

functionals whose generalized versions deal with basic current densities (see e.g. [13]).

SRPA has been already applied for atomic nuclei and clusters, both spherical and de-

formed. To study dynamics of valence electrons in atomic clusters, the Konh-Sham func-

tional [14, 15]was exploited [7, 8, 16, 17], in some cases together with pseudopotential and

pseudo-Hamiltonian schemes [16]. Excellent agreement with the experimental data [18] for

the dipole plasmon was obtained. Quite recently SRPA was used to demonstrate a non-

trivial interplay between Landau fragmentation, deformation splitting and shape isomers in

forming a proﬁle of the dipole plasmon in deformed clusters [17].

In atomic nuclei, SRPA was derived [9, 10, 19] for the demanding Skyrme functional in-

volving a variety of densities and currents (see [20] for the recent review on Skyrme forces).

SRPA calculations for isoscalar and isovector giant resonances (nuclear counterparts of elec-

tronic plasmons) in doubly magic nuclei demonstrated high accuracy of the method [10].

In the present paper, we give a detail, maybe even tutorial, description of SRPA, consider

and discuss its most important particular cases and compare it with alternative approaches,

including the equation-of-motion method in the coupled-cluster theory. We thus pursue the

aim to advocate SRPA for researchers from other areas, e.g. from the quantum chemistry.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, derivation of the the SRPA formalism

is done. Relations of SRPA with other alternative approaches are commented. In Sec. 3,

the method to calculate SRPA strength function (counterpart of the linear response theory)

is outlined.

In Section IV, the particular SRPA versions for the electronic Kohn-Sham

and nuclear Skyrme functionals are speciﬁed and the origin and role of time-odd currents

in functionals are scrutinized.

In Sec. V, the practical SRPA realization is discussed.

Some examples demonstrating accuracy of the method in atomic clusters and nuclei are

presented. The summary is done in Sec. VI. In Appendix A, densities and currents for

3

Skyrme functional are listed. In Appendix B, the optimal ways to calculate SRPA basic

values are discussed.

p (ah) is the creation
(annihilation) operator of the particle state p (hole state h); K is the number of the separable

where

terms.

Conceptually, the self-consistent procedure outlined below was ﬁrst proposed in [21].

A. Time-dependent Hamiltonian

The system is assumed to undergo small-amplitude harmonic vibrations around HF

ground state. The starting point is a general time-dependent energy functional

E(Jα(~r, t)) =

(Jα(~r, t))d~r

Z H

depending on an arbitrary set of densities and currents deﬁned through the corresponding

operators as

Jα(~r, t) =< Ψ(t)

ˆJα(~r)

Ψ(t) >=

h(~r, t) ˆJα(~r)ϕh(~r, t)
ϕ∗

|

occ

Xh

where Ψ(t) is the many-body function of the system as a Slater determinant, and ϕ∗

h is the
wave function of the hole (occupied) single-particle state. In general, the set (3) includes

both time-even and time-odd densities and currents, see examples in the Appendix A.

Time-dependent mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian directly follows from (2)-(3):

In the small-amplitude regime, the densities are decomposed into static part and small

time-dependent variation

Jα(~r, t) = ¯Jα(~r) + δJα(~r, t).

(5)

Then, to the linear order for δJα(~r, t), the mean-ﬁeld Hamiltonian (4) can be decomposed

into static and time-dependent response parts

ˆh(~r, t) = ˆh0(~r) + ˆhres(~r, t),

(6)

and thus we get the time-dependent Hamiltonian ˆhres(~r, t) responsible for the collective

motion.

B. Scaling perturbation

Now we should specify the response Hamiltonian ˆhres(~r, t). For this aim, we use the

scaling transformation and deﬁne the perturbed many-body wave function of the system as

As is shown below, ˆXk and ˆYk are just the T-even and T-odd operators to be exploited in

the separable expansion (1).

T-parity

In the derivation above, we used the property of hermitian operators with a deﬁnite

< 0

[ ˆA, ˆB]
|

|

0 >= 0,

if T ˆAT −1 = T ˆBT −1

which states that the average of the commutator vanishes if the operators ˆA and ˆB are of

the same T-parity. This property allows to classify operators with a deﬁnite T-parity in the

SRPA formalism and thus to make the formalism simple and transparent. For example, in
Eqs. (11)-(12), T-even and T-odd densities ˆJα(~r) contribute separately to ˆXk and ˆYk.

To complete the construction of the separable expansion (1), we should yet determine the

strength matrices κkk′ and ηkk′. This can be done through variations of the basic operators

In principle, we already have in our disposal the SRPA formalism for description of the

collective motion in space of collective variables. Indeed, Eqs. (11), (12), (18), and (19)

deliver one-body operators and strength matrices we need for the separable expansion of the

two-body interaction. The number K of the collective variables qk(t) and pk(t) and separable

terms depends on how precisely we want to describe the collecive motion (see discussion in

Section 4). For K = 1, SRPA converges to the sum rule approach with a one collective mode

[6]. For K > 1, we have a system of K coupled oscillators and SRPA is reduced to the local

RPA [6, 24] suitable for a rough description of several modes and or main gross-structure

efects. However, SRPA is still not ready to describe the Landau fragmentation. For this

aim, we should consider the detailed 1ph space. This will be done in the next subsection.

C.

Introduction of 1ph space

Collective modes can be viewed as superpositions of 1ph conﬁgurations. It is convenient to

deﬁne this relation by using the Thouless theorem which establishes the connection between

7

two arbitrary Slater determinants [25]. Then, the perturbed many-body wave function reads

lective variables can be also speciﬁed as harmonic oscillations

Substituting (10) and (25) into the time-dependent HF equation

qk(t) = ¯qkcos(ωt) =

¯qk(eiωt + e−iωt),

pk(t) = ¯pksin(ωt) =

In addition to Eqs. (17)-(18), the variations δ ˆXk(t) and δ ˆYk(t) can be now obtained with

E. General discussion

Eqs. (11), (12), (18), (19), (30), (35)-(39), and (40)-(43) constitute the basic SRPA for-

malism. It is worth now to comment some essential points:

One may show (e.g. by using a standard derivation of the matrix RPA) that the separa-

•
ble Hamiltonian (23)-(24) with (40) results in the SRPA equations (35)-(39) if to express
ph through ¯q¯k and ¯p¯k. Generally, RPA equations for unknowns cν±
unknowns cν±
ph require the
RPA matrix of the high rank equal to size of the 1ph basis. The separable approximation

allows to reformulate the RPA problem in terms of much more compact unknows ¯q¯k and

¯p¯k (see relation (30) and thus to minimize the computational eﬀort. As is seen from (35),

the rank of the SRPA matrix is equal to a double number K of the separable operators and

hence is low.

The number of RPA eigen-states ν is equal to the number of the relevant 1ph conﬁgura-

•
tions used in the calculations. In heavy nuclei and atomic clusters, this number ranges the

interval 103-106. For every RPA state ν, Eq. (35) delivers a particular set of the amplitudes
¯qν
sk and ¯pν
diﬀerent T-even and T-odd oscillating densities to the ν-state.

sk which, following Eq. (30), self-consistently regulate relative contrubutions of

Eqs. (11), (12), (18), (19) relate the basic SRPA values with the starting functional and

•

10

input operators ˆQk and ˆPk by a simple and physically transparent way. This makes SRPA

very convenient for the analysis and treatment of the obtained results.

It is instructive to express the basic SRPA operators via the separable residual interaction

•
(24):

ˆXk = [ ˆVres, ˆPk]ph,

ˆYk = [ ˆVres, ˆQk]ph

(44)

where the index ph means the 1ph part of the operator. It is seen that the T-odd operator
ˆPk retains the T-even part of Vres to build ˆXk. Vice versa, the commutator with the T-even
operator ˆQk keeps the T-odd part of Vres to build ˆYk.

Some of the SRPA values read as averaged commutators between T-odd and T-even

•
operators. This allows to establish useful relations with other models. For example, (18),

(19) and (44) give

interaction) correspond to m3 and m1 sum rules, respectively, and so represent the spring
and inertia parameters [24] in the basis of collective generators ˆQk and ˆPk. This allows to

establish the connection of the SRPA with the sum rule approach [22, 23] and local RPA

[24].

(see discussion in the Appendix B).

Besides, the commutator form of SRPA values can considerably simplify their calculation

SRPA restores the conservation laws (e.g. translational invariance) violated by the static
•
mean ﬁeld. Indeed, let’s assume a symmetry mode with the generator ˆPsym. Then, to keep
the conservation law [ ˆH, ˆPsym] = 0, we simply have to include ˆPsym into the set of the input
generators ˆPk together with its complement ˆQsym = i[ ˆH, ˆPsym].

SRPA equations are very general and can be applied to diverse systems (atomic nuclei,

•
atomic clusters, etc.) described by density and current-dependent functionals. Even Bose

systems can be covered if to redeﬁne the many-body wave function (25) exhibiting the per-

turbation through the elementary excitations. In this case, the Slater deterninant for 1ph

excitations should be replaced by a perturbed many-body function in terms of elementary

bosonic excitations.

•

In fact, SRPA is the ﬁrst TDLDA iteration with the initial wave function (7). A single

11

iteration is generally not enough to get the complete convergence of TDLDA results. How-

ever, SRPA calculations demonstrate that high accuracy can be achieved even in this case if
to ensure the optimal choice of the input operators ˆQk and ˆPk and keep suﬃcient amount of

the separable terms (see discussion in Sec. 5). In this case, the ﬁrst iteration already gives

quite accurate results.

There are some alternative RPA schemes also delivering self-consistent factorization of

•
the two-body residual interaction, see e.g.

[21, 27, 28, 29] for atomic nuclei and [30, 31]

for atomic clusters. However, these schemes are usually not suﬃciently general. Some of

them are limited to analytic or simple numerical estimates [21, 27, 30], next ones start from

phenomenological single-particle potentials and thus are not fully self-consistent [28], the

others need a large number of the separable terms to get an appropriate numerical accuracy

[29, 31]. SRPA has evident advantages as compared with these schemes.

After solution of the SRPA problem, the Hamiltonian (23)-(24) is reduced to a composition

•
of one-phonon RPA excitations

ˆH =

ων ˆQ+
ν

ˆQν

Xν
where one-phonon operators are given by (40)

the equation-of-motion (EOM) method:

(41). Then, it is easy to get expressions of

−

[ ˆH, ˆQ+

ν ] = ων ˆQ+
ν ,

[ ˆH, ˆQν] =

ων ˆQν.

−

So, SRPA and EOM with the Hamiltonian (23)-(24) are equivalent. This allows to to

establish the connection between the SRPA and couled-cluster EOM method with the single

reference (see for reviews [32, 33, 34, 35]). SRPA uses the excitation operators involving

only singles (1ph) and so generally carries less correlations than EOM-CC. At the same

time, SRPA delivers very elegant and physically transparent calculations scheme and, as is

shown in our calculations, the correlations included to the SRPA are often quite enough

to describe linear dynamics. It would be interesting to construct the approach combining

(47)

(48)

advantages of SRPA and EOM-CC.

III. STRENGTH FUNCTION

In study of response of a system to external ﬁelds, we are usually interested in the

average strength function instead of the responses of particular RPA states. For example,

12

giant resonances in heavy nuclei are formed by thousands of RPA states whose contributions

in any case cannot be distinguished experimentally. In this case, it is reasonable to consider

the averaged response described by the strength function. Besides, the calculation of the

strength function is usually much easier.

For electric external ﬁelds of multipolarity Eλµ, the strength function can be deﬁned as

It is worth noting that, unlike the standard deﬁnition of the strength function with using

δ(ω

ων), we exploit here the Lorentz weight.

It is very convenient to simulate various

−

smoothing eﬀects.

The explicite expression for (49) can be obtained by using the Cauchy residue theorem.

For this aim, the strength function is recasted as a sum of ν residues for the poles z =

ων. Since the sum of all the residues (covering all the poles) is zero, the residues with

ων (whose calculation is time consuming) can be replaced by the sum of residies with

i(∆/2) and z =

εph whose calculation is much less expensive (see details of the

The ﬁrst term in (53) is contribution of the residual two-body interaction while the second

B2K+1,2K+1(z) = 0, B2K+1,n(z) = Bn,2K+1(z) = An(z)

where n, n′ = 1, ..., 2K and left (right) indexes deﬁne lines (columns).

Derivation of the strentth function, given above, deviates from the standard one in the

lineary response theory. Besides, the SRPA deals with the Lorentz weight instead of δ(ω

−

used in the linear response theory. At the same time, SRPA strength function and lineary

response theory are conceptually the same approaches. Since the linear response theory is

widely used in the coupled-cluster (CC) method, it would be interesting to consider the

implementation of SRPA stength function method to CC. The linear response theory is

widely used in the coupled-cluster (CC) method. In this connection, it would be interesting

to enlarge the SRPA stength function method to CC.

respectively. Further, ρi(~r) is the ionic density and ρ(~r, t) and τ (~r, t) are density and kinetic

energy density of valence electrons.

In atomic clusters, oscillations of valence electrons are generated by time-dependent varia-

tions of the electronic T-even density ρ(~r, t) only. So, one may neglect in the SRPA formalism

all T-odd densities and their variations pk(t). This makes SRPA equations especially simple.

In particular, the density variation (9) is reduced to

through the ground state density. The second way is the most simple. It becomes possible
because, in atomic clusters, Vres has no T-odd ˆYk-operators and thus the commutator of ˆQk

It is seen that the basic operator (65) and strength matrix (66) have now simple expressions

via δρ(~r) from (62). The operator (65) has exchange-correlation and Coulomb terms. For

electric multipole oscillations (dipole plasmon, ...), the Coulomb term dominates.

In recent years, there appear some new functionals where the current of electrons in-

stead of their density is used as a basic variable [13]. SRPA equations for this case can be

straightforwardly obtained from the general formalism given in Sec. 2.

B. Skyrme functional for atomic nuclei

Nuclear interaction is very complicated and its explicit form is still unknown. So, in

practice diﬀerent approximations to nuclear interaction are used. Skyrme forces [11, 12]

represent one of the most successful approximations where the interaction is maximally

simpliﬁed and, at the same time, allows to get accurate and universal description of both

16

ground state properties and dynamics of atomic nuclei (see [20] a for recent review). Skyrme

forces are contact, i.e.

~r2), which minimizes the computational eﬀort. In spite of

δ(~r1 −

∼

this dramatic simpliﬁcation, Skyrme forcese well reproduce properties of most spherical and

deformed nuclei as well as characteristics of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Additional

advantage of the Skyrme interaction is that its parameters are directly related to the basic

nuclear properties: incompressibility, nuclear radii, masses and binding energies, etc. SRPA

for Skyrme forces was derived in [9, 10, 19, 26].

Although Skyrme forces are relatively simple, they are still much more demanding than

the Coulomb interaction.

In particular, they deal with a variety of diverse densities and

currents. The Skyrme functional reads [12, 36, 37]

are kinetic, Coulomb and Skyrme terms respectively. The isospin index s = n, p covers

neutrons (n) and protons (p). Densities without this index involve both neutrons and

protons, e.g. ρ = ρp + ρn. Parameters b and α are ﬁtted to describe ground state properties

of atomic nuclei.

The functional includes diverse densities and currents, both neutrons and protons. They

are naturally separated into two groups: 1) T-even density ρs(~r), kinetic energy density
τs(~r) and spin orbital density ~
ℑs(~r) and 2) T-odd spin density σs(~r), current ~js(~r) and
vector kinetic energy density ~Ts(~r). Explicit expressions for these densities and currents, as

17

well as for their operators, are given in the appendix A. Only T-even densities contribute to

the ground state properties of nuclei with even numbers of protons and neutrons (and thus

with T-even wave function of the ground state). Instead, both T-even and T-odd densities

participate in generation of nuclear oscillations. Sec. 2 delivers the SRPA formalism for this

general case.

C. T-odd densities and currents

Comparison of the Kohn-Sham and Skyrme functionals leads to a natural question why

these two functionals exploit, for the time-dependent problem, so diﬀerent sets of basic

densities and currents? If the Kohn-Sham functional is content with one density, the Skyrme

forces operate with a diverse set of densities and currents, both T-even and T-odd. Then,

should we consider T-odd densities as genuine for the description of dynamics of ﬁnite many-

body systems or they are a pequliarity of nuclear forces? This question is very nontrivial

and still poorly studied. We present below some comments which, at least partly, clarify

this point.

Actual nuclear forces are of a ﬁnite range. These are, for example, Gogny forces [40]

representing more realistic approximation of actual nuclear forces than Skyrme approxima-

tion. Gogny interaction has no any velocity dependence and fulﬁlls the Galilean invariance.
Instead, two-body Skyrme interaction depends on relative velocities ~k = 1/2i
~
∇2),

(~
∇1 −

·

which just simulates the ﬁnite range eﬀects [20].

The static Hartree-Fock problem assumes T-reversal invariance and T-even single-particle

density matrix. In this case, Skyrme forces can be limited by only T-even densities: ρs(~r),
τs(~r) and ~

In the case of dynamics, the density matrix is not already T-even and

ℑs(~r).

aquires T-odd components [12]. This fact, together with velocity dependence of the Skyrme

interaction, results in appearance in the Skyrme functional of T-odd densities and currents:
~ss(~r), ~js(~r) and ~Ts(~r) [12, 36]. Hence the origin of T-odd densities in the Skyrme functional.

However, this is not the general case for nuclear forces.

As compared with the Kohn-Sham functional for electronic systems, the nuclear Skyrme

functional is less genuine. The main (Coulomb) interaction in the Kohn-Sham problem is

well known and only exchange and corellations should be modeled. Instead, in the nuclear

case, even the basic interaction is unknown and should be approximated, e.g. by the simple

18

contact interaction in Skyrme forces.

The crudeness of Skyrme forces has certain consequences. For example, the Skyrme

functional has no any exchange-correlation term since the relevant eﬀects are supposed to be

already included into numerous Skyrme ﬁtting parameters. Besides, the Skyrme functional

may accept a diverse set of T-even and T-dd densities and currents. One may say that

T-odd densities appear in the Skyrme functional partly because of its speciﬁc construction.

Indeed, other eﬀective nuclear forces (Gogny [40] , Landau-Migdal [41]) do not exploit T-odd

densities and currents for description of nuclear dynamics.

Implementation of a variety of densities and currents in the Skyrme fuctional has, how-

ever, some advantages.

It is known that diﬀerent projectiles and external ﬁelds used to

generate collective modes in nuclear reactions are often selective to particular densities and

currents. For example, some elastic magnetic collective modes (scissors, twist) are asso-

ciated with variations in the momentum space while keeping the common density ρs(~r)

about constant. T-odd densities and currents can play here a signiﬁcant role while Skyrme

forces obtain the advantage to describe the collective motion by a natural and physically

transparent way.

Relative contributions of T-odd densities to a given mode should obviously depend on

the character of this mode. Electric multipole excitations (plasmons in atomic clusters, Eλ

giant resonances in atomic nuclei) are mainly provided by T-even densities (see e.g.

[19]).

Instead, T-odd densities and currents might be important for magnetic modes and maybe

some exotic (toroidal, ...) electric modes.

It worth noting that T-odd denstities appear in the Skyrme functional in the speciﬁc

combinations ρsτs −
Skyrme forces to fulﬁll the local gauge invariance (and Galilean invariance as the particular

case). The velocity-independent ﬁnite-range Gogny forces also keep this invariance. Being

combined into speciﬁc combinations, T-odd densities do not require any new Skyrme param-

eters [37]. So, the parameters ﬁtted to the static nuclear properties with T-even densities

only, are enough for description of the dynamics as well.

The time-dependent density functional theory [38] for electronic systems is usually imple-

mented at adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) when density and single-particle

potential are supposed to vary slowly both in time and space. Last years, the current-

dependent Kohn-Sham functionals with a current density as a basic variable were introduced

19

to treat the collective motion beyond ALDA (see e.g. [13]). These functionals are robust for

a time-dependent linear response problem where the ordinary density functionals become

strongly nonlocal. The theory is reformulated in terms of a vector potential for exchange

and correlations, depending on the induced current density. So, T-odd variables appear in

electronic functionals as well.

In general, the role of T-odd variables in dynamics of ﬁnite many-body systems is still

rather vague. This fundamental problem devotes deep and comprehensive study.

V. CHOICE OF INITIAL OPERATORS

It is easy to see that, after choosing the initial operators ˆQk(~r), all other SRPA values

can be straightforwardly determined following the steps

ˆQk ⇒

<

[ ˆQk, ˆJα]
|

|

>

⇒

ˆYk, η−1
kk′

ˆPk ⇒

<

[ ˆPk, ˆJα]
|

|

>

⇒

⇒

ˆXk, κ−1
kk′.

As was mentioned above, the proper choice of initial operators ˆQk(~r) is crucial to achieve

good convergence of the separable expansion (1) with a minimal number of separable oper-

ators.

SRPA itself does not give a recipe to determine ˆQk(~r). But choice of these operators

can be inspired by physical and computational arguments. The operators should be simple

and universal in the sense that they can be applied equally well to all modes and excitation

channels. The main idea is that the initial operators should result in exploration of diﬀerent

spatial regions of the system, the surface and interior. This suggests that the leading scaling

operator should have the form of the applied external ﬁeld in the long-wave approximation,

for example,

ˆQλµ

k=1(~r) = rλ(Yλµ(Ω) + h.c.).

(74)

Such a choice results in the separable operators (11), (12) and (65) most sensitive to the

surface of the system. This is evident in (65) where δρ(~r)

¯ρ(~r) is peaked at the surface.

~
▽

∝

Many collective oscillations manifest themselves as predominantly surface modes. As a

result, already one separable term generating by (74) usually delivers a quite good description

of collective excitations like plasmons in atomic clusters and giant resonances in atomic

nuclei. The detailed distributions depends on a subtle interplay of surface and volume

vibrations. This can be resolved by taking into account the nuclear interior. For this aim,

20

the radial parts with larger powers rλ+nkYλµ and spherical Bessel functions can be used, much

similar as in the local RPA [24]. This results in the shift of the maxima of the operators

(11), (12) and (65) to the interior. Exploring diﬀerent conceivable combinations, one may

found a most eﬃcient set of the initial operators.

enough to reproduce the energy of the dipole plasmon and its branches but in this case the

plasmon acquires some artiﬁcial strength in its right ﬂank and thus the overestimated width

[7]. This problem can be solved by adding two more initial operators. The calculations for

a variety of spherical alkali metal clusters [16] as well as for deformed clusters of a medium

size [17] show that SRPA correcly describes not only gross structure of the dipole plasmon

but also its Landau damping and width.

where Rdiﬀ is the diﬀraction radius of the actual nucleus and zλ is the ﬁrst root in of the

spherical Bessel function jλ(zλ) = 0. The separable term with k = 1 is mainly localized at

the nuclear surface while the next terms are localized more and more in the interior. This

simple set seems to be a best compromise for the description of nuclear giant resonances in

light and heavy nuclei. Fig. 2 demonstrates that already one separable term (k=1) can be

enough to get a reasonable agreement with the exact results. For k=1, the calculations are

22

especially simple and results are easily analyzed.

The sets (75)-(77) are optimal for description of electric collective modes (Eλ plasmons

in clusters and giant resonances in nuclei). For description of magnetic modes, the initial

operator should resemble the T-odd magnetic external ﬁeld. So, in this case we should start
from the initial operators ˆPk in the form of the magnetic multipole transition operator in the
long-wave approximation. The T-even operators ˆQk are then obtained from the connection
ˆQk = i[ ˆH, ˆPk].

VI. SUMMARY

We presented fully self-consistent

separable random-phase-approximation (SRPA)

method for description of linear dynamics of diﬀerent ﬁnite Fermi-systems. The method

is very general, physically transparent, convenient for the analysis and treatment of the

results. SRPA drastically simpliﬁes the calculations. It allows to get a high numerical ac-

curacy with a minimal computational eﬀort. The method is especially eﬀective for systems

with a number of particles 10

103, where quantum-shell eﬀects in the spectra and responses

−

are signiﬁcant. In such systems, the familiar macroscopic methods are too rough while the

full-scale microscopic methods are too expensive. SRPA seems to be here the best com-

promise between quality of the results and the computational eﬀort. As the most involved

methods, SRPA describes the Landau damping, one of the most important characteristics of

the collective motion. SRPA results can be obtained in terms of both separate RPA states

and the strength function (linear response to external ﬁelds).

The particular SRPA versions for electronic Kohn-Sham and nuclear Skyrme functional

were considered and examples of the calculations for the dipole plasmon in atomic clusters

and giant resonances in atomic nuclei were presented. SRPA was compared with alternative

methods, in particular with EOM-CC. It would be interesting to combine advantages of

SRPA and couled-cluster approach in one powerful method.

Calculation of these values can be greatly simpliﬁed if to express them through the 1ph
matrix elements of the operators ˆA and ˆB.

In the case of the strength matrices, the matrix elements are real for T-even operators

and image for T-odd operators and thus we easily get

where Kp and Kh are projections of the momentum of particle and hole states onto quanti-

The case of responses is more involved in the sense that matrix elements of the second

operator in the commutator are transition densities which are generally complex. However,
the ﬁrst operator in the commutator still has real (for T-even ˆA) or image (for T-odd ˆA)

matrix elements and so the averages can be ﬁnally reduced to

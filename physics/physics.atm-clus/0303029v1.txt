We apply a hard-core version of the Faddeev differential equations to the 3He4He2 three-atomic
system. Using these equations we calculate the binding energy of the 3He4He2 trimer with the
LM2M2 potential by Aziz and Slaman and more recent TTY potential by Tang, Toennies and Yiu.

Introduction

There is a great number of experimental and theoretical studies of the 4He three-
atomic system (see, e. g., [1]–[13] and references cited therein). The non-symmetric system
3He4He2 found comparatively little attention. We can only mention the recent works [6],
[8], and [13] where the 3He4He2 trimers were treated alongside with small 4He clusters.
Until now only the bound states of the 3He4He2 system have been studied numerically.
There are still no scattering calculations reported for this system.

The 4He trimer is known in particular for the Eﬁmov’s nature of its excited state (see
[3, 6, 8, 14]. The binding energy of the 4He dimer is extremely small (about 1 mK) on
the molecular scale. The large spatial extension of the 4He2 bound state generates a long-
range effective interaction between a 4He dimer and additional 4He atom which results in
a possibility of existence of extremely extended 4He three-atomic states.

Being a more light particle than 4He, the 3He atom supports no bound state with the
4He counterpart and no 3He dimer exists. Thus, the 3He4He2 is even a more loosely bound
system than the 4He trimer. According to the hyperspherical adiabatic calculations of [6, 8]
and Monte-Carlo investigation of [13] the realistic He-He potentials such as LM2M2 [15]
and TTY [16] support only one bound state of the 3He4He2 trimer with the energy of the
order of 10–15 mK.

Notice that the 4He/3He three-atomic systems belong to the three–body systems whose
theoretical treatment is quite difﬁcult. The difﬁculty is mainly due to the two reasons. First,
the low energy of the practically on-threshold bound states makes it necessary to consider
very large domains in conﬁguration space with a size of hundreds of ˚A. Second, the strong
repulsive part of the He-He interaction at short distances produces large numerical errors.
Like [9, 11], the present work is based on a mathematically rigorous hard-core version of
the Faddeev differential equations. This method allows to overcome the strong-repulsion

problem. The ﬁrst of the problems just mentioned is tackled by choosing sufﬁciently large
grids.

This note represents rather a ﬁrst step in an extension of the numerical approach of
[9, 11] to the case of three-body systems including particles with different masses. In the
nearest future we plan not only to continue our study of the 3He4He2 bound state but
also to perform calculations of the scattering of a 3He atom off a 4He2 dimer. Here we
only outline the method employed and report our ﬁrst results for the binding energy of the
3He4He2 system.

In the following we assume that the 4He atoms are assigned the numbers 1 and 2 while the
4He atom has the number 3. By c we denote the hard-core radius which will be taken the
same (in coordinates xa ) for all three inter-atomic interaction potentials. A recent detail
description of the Faddeev differential equations in the hard-core model which we employ
can be found in [9]. Nevertheless we outline here some essential characteristics of the
hard-core Faddeev approach needed for understanding our numerical procedure.

Since the 4He atoms are identical bosons the corresponding Faddeev component F3(x3, y3)

is invariant under the permutations the particles 1 and 2 which implies

The identity of the two 4He atoms also implies that the Faddeev components F1(x1, y1) and
F2(x2, y2) are obtained from each other by a simple rotation of the coordinate space. Thus,
we only have two independent Faddeev components, the one associated with the 4He–4He
subsystem, F3(x, y), and another one, say F1(x, y), associated with a pair of 3He and 4He
atoms. The resulting hard-core Faddeev equations read

3 Results

We employed the Faddeev equations (7), the hard-core boundary condition (8), and the
asymptotic condition (10) to calculate the binding energy of the helium trimer 3He4He2.
As He-He interaction we used the semi-empirical LM2M2 potential of Aziz and Slaman
[15] and the latest theoretical potential TTY of Tang, Toennies and Yiu [16]. In our present
calculations we used the value ¯h2/m = 12.1192 K ˚A2 where m stands for the mass of a
4He atom. (Notice the difference between this more precise value and the value ¯h2/m =
12.12 K ˚A2 which was used in the previous calculations [9, 11].) Both the LM2M2 and TTY
potentials produce a weakly bound state for the 4He dimer. We found that the 4He-dimer
energy is 1.309 mK in case the LM2M2 interaction and 1.316 mK for the TTY potential.
Both LM2M2 and TTY support no bound state for the 4He3He two-atomic system.

As in [9, 11] we considered a ﬁnite-difference approximation of the boundary-value
problem (7, 8, 10) in the polar coordinates r =
x2 + y2 and q = arctan(y/x). The grids
were chosen such that the points of intersection of the arcs r = r
i, i = 1, 2, . . . , Nr and the
p
rays q = q
j, j = 1, 2, . . . , Nq with the core boundary x = c constitute the knots. The value
of the core radius was chosen to be c = 1 ˚A by the same argument as in [11]. Also the
method for choosing the grid radii r
j) was the same as
described in [11].

i (and, thus, the grid hyperangles q

0 (x, y) and f (3)

In the present investigation we were restricted to considering only the two lowest par-
tial components f (1)
0 (x, y) and therefore we only dealt with the two partial
equations of the system (7) corresponding to l = 0. We solved the block three-diagonal
algebraic system, arising as a result of the ﬁnite-difference approximation of (7, 8, 10), on
the basis of the matrix sweep method [19]. This method makes it possible to avoid using
disk storage for the matrix during the computation.

The best possible dimensions of the grids which we employed in this investigation
605 grid with r max = 200 ˚A the
were Nr = 600 and Nq = 605. We found that on the 600
LM2M2 potential supports the bound state of the 3He4He2 with the energy Et = 7.33 mK
while the corresponding binding energy produced by the TTY potential is Et = 7.28 mK.
Our ﬁgures for Et correspond to the lowest possible dimension of the system (7).
We consider this as reason why our results show a signiﬁcant underboundedness of the
3He4He2 trimer as compared to the available results for Et obtained for the TTY potential
on the basis of the variational VMC (9.585 mK [13]) and DMC (14.165 mK [13]) meth-
ods and for the LM2M2 potential on the basis of a one-channel hyperespherical adibatic

approximation of the Faddeev differential equations (9.682 mK [8]) and (10.22 mK [6]).
We think the situation will change when more partial waves in (7) will be employed. A
certain (but rather small) deepening of the binding energy Et may also be expected due to
choosing the grids with larger Nq and Nr .

Abstract

We have used the stabilized spin-polarized jellium model to calculate the equilib-
rium sizes of metal clusters. Our self-consistent calculations in the local spin-density
approximation show that for an N -electron cluster, the equilibrium is achieved for
a conﬁguration in which the diﬀerence in the numbers of up-spin and down-spin
electrons is zero or unity, depending on the total number of electrons. That is, a
conﬁguration in which the spins are maximally compensated. This maximum spin-
compensation results in both the alternation in the average distance between the
nearest neighbor ions and the odd-even alternations in the ionization energies of al-
kali metal clusters, in a good agreement with the molecular dynamics ﬁndings and
the experiment. These suggest a realistic and more accurate method for calculating
the properties of metal clusters in the context of jellium model than previous jellium
model methods.

1 Introduction

The simplest model used in theoretical study of the properties of simple metal clusters

replaced by a uniform positive charge background sphere of density n = 3/4πr3
s and
radius R = (zN)1/3rs where z, N and rs are the valence of the atom, the number of
constituent atoms of the cluster and the bulk value of the Wigner-Seitz (WS) radius of
the metal, respectively. This model can be useful only when the pseudopotentials of
the ions do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the electronic structure. But, it is well-known that
[4, 5] Keeping the simplicity of the JM, the stabilized
the JM has some drawbacks.
jellium model (SJM) of Perdew et al.[6] has lifted the essential deﬁciencies of the JM
and signiﬁcantly improved the results of calculations. In the SJM, the bulk metal (which
is spin-unpolarized in the absence of external magnetic ﬁeld) has been made stabilized
through the introduction of a pseudopotential and ﬁxing its core radius by a value that
makes the pressure on the unpolarized bulk system to vanish. However, applying the SJM
in the framework of rigid jellium background [7] may be suitable for closed-shell clusters
of which the spin polarization of the valence electrons vanishes. It is well-known that,
for example, the bond-length of a diatomic molecule depends on the relative orientations
of the valence electrons. Hence, considering a metal cluster as a large molecule, or the
bulk metal as a huge molecule, one should take account of the volume change due to spin
polarization. We therefore, expect that the spherical jellium radius should be diﬀerent for
an N-atom cluster with two diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations. These facts led us to consider
a stabilized jellium model in which the spin degrees of freedom be present. Stabilizing
the jellium system with non-zero spin polarization, ζ, for the valence electrons resulted
in the stabilized spin-polarized jellium model (SSPJM).[8] Here ζ = (n↑
n↓)/(n↑ + n↓)
and n↑, n↓ are the spin-up and spin-down electron densities, respectively. The SSPJM
can be applied to metal clusters in two diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst method, which has been
used in Ref.[8], exploits the fact that the bulk metal expands as ζ increases. We call that
method as SSPJM1 throughout this paper. In that method, the jellium sphere radius is
taken as R(ζ) = (zN)1/3 ¯rs(ζ). For ¯rs(ζ) we had taken ¯rs(ζ) = ¯rs(0) + ∆rs(ζ) in which
¯rs(0) was the observed value of the bulk WS radius of the metal and ∆rs was obtained
by the application of the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) to the inﬁnite electron
gas system. However, in our phenomenological accounting of the volume change, the
core radius of the pseudo-potential for the electron-ion interaction has been considered
as a parameter, which becomes polarization dependent as we force the pressure of the
polarized bulk system to vanish. Using that scheme, we had calculated the energies of
diﬀerent metal clusters, both neutral and singly ionized, for diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations

−

and had shown that instead of Hund’s ﬁrst rule for the ground state, the maximum spin-
compensation (MSC) rule was governing.[8] The MSC property which originates here from
the polarization dependence of the core radius, leads to the odd-even alternations in the
ionization energies that had been observed experimentally in the alkali metal clusters.[9]
On the other hand, if one assumes a ﬁxed, polarization-independent form for the electron-
ion interaction, the MSC property will be realized only for non-spherical geometries of
the jellium background.

We have recently shown[10] that it is not always necessary for a ﬁnite spherical jellium
system to increase its size as the polarization, ζ, is increased. This can be explained by
considering the fact that for an open-shell cluster if one increases the spin polarization
from the possible minimum value consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle, one should
make a spin-ﬂip in the last uncomplete shell. Because of high degeneracy for the spherical
geometry, this spin-ﬂip in the last shell does not change appreciably the kinetic energy
contribution to the total energy but changes appreciably the exchange-correlation energy
which in turn gives rise to a deeper eﬀective potential that makes the Kohn-Sham (KS)
[11] orbitals more localized and therefore a smaller size for the cluster. On the other
hand, although the SSPJM1 results in better ionization energies than the SJM [7] in that
it reproduces the odd-even alternation, it always predicts incorrect cluster sizes. That
is, in the SSPJM1, the equilibrium rs for a cluster is taken to be greater or equal to the
bulk value of rs ( see Fig. 3 of Ref. [8] ), so that it approaches the bulk value from the
above; whereas, the molecular dynamics (MD) results for the average distance between
the nearest neighbor atoms show that the equilibrium rs value of the neutral clusters are
less than the bulk value and it approaches the bulk value from the below [ see Fig 15(a)
of Ref. 13]. To incorporate this correct behavior into our SSPJM calculations, which is
the subject of this paper, we proceed parallel to the work of Perdew et al.[12] for the spin-
polarized case and call this method as SSPJM2. In the SSPJM2, for a given polarization,
we ﬁrst obtain the value of the core radius of the pseudopotential that stabilizes the bulk
system, say rB
in the energy functional of the cluster,
we change the radius of the jellium sphere until the minimum energy is achieved. Our
self-consistent calculations show that the absolute minimum energy corresponds to a spin
conﬁguration with maximum compensation as in the SSPJM1 case. The equilibrium rs
values corresponding to these minima lie below the bulk value, reproducing the correct
behavior. These equilibrium rs values determine the equilibrium sizes of the clusters. If
we plot the equilibrium rs value as a function of the number of constituent atoms in an
alkali metal cluster, we see an alternating behavior, consistent with the MD results.[13]
In this paper we have found the equilibrium properties of neutral and singly ionized Cs,

For the sake of comparison, we have derived the results of the work by Perdew et al.[12]
which is denoted by SJM1. Comparing our SSPJM2 results with those of SSPJM1 show
that here, the average energies per electron and the ionization energies remain more or
less the same but here, our SSPJM2 calculations show an improvement over the SSPJM1
results for the equilibrium sizes of the clusters.

In section 2 the calculational schemes has been explained. Section 3 is devoted to the

results of our calculations and ﬁnally, we conclude this work in section 4.

2 Calculational Scheme

In the context of the SSPJM, the average energy per valence electron in the bulk with
density parameter rs and polarization ζ is given by[8]

ε(rs, ζ) = ts(rs, ζ) + εxc(rs, ζ) + ¯wR(rs, rc) + εM(rs),

(1)

where ts and εxc are noninteracting kinetic energy and exchange-correlation energies per
electron, respectively. ¯wR is the average value (over the WS cell) of the repulsive part of
the Ashcroft empty core[14] pseudopotential,

and is given by ¯wR = 3r2
s. In Eq.(2), z is the valence of the atom, and θ(x) is the
ordinary step function which assumes the value of unity for positive arguments, and zero
for negative values. The core radius, rc, will be ﬁxed by setting the pressure of the bulk
system equal to zero at equilibrium density ¯n(ζ) = 3/4π¯r3
s(ζ). In Eq.(1), εM is the average
9z/5r0. Here, r0 is the radius of the WS sphere, r0 = z1/3rs,
Madelung energy, εM =
and for monovalent metals z = 1, and for polyvalent metals we set z∗ = 1 (for details
see Ref.[6]). All equations throughout this paper are expressed in Rydberg atomic units.
The bulk stability is achieved when rc takes a value that makes the pressure of the system
with a given ζ to vanish at rs = ¯rs(ζ):

N
calculations for Cs, Na, and Al with 2
42 show that the absolute minimum-
energy conﬁguration obeys the MSC rule and the equilibrium rs value for the cluster,
¯rs(N, ζ), is less than the bulk value because, for small clusters the ratio of surface to
volume energies become comparable and the surface tension compresses the cluster. This
eﬀect is known as self-compression.[12] In Fig. 1 we have compared the equilibrium rs
values of “generic clusters”, JM1 (see Ref. 10), with the SJM1 results which reproduce
correct trends.[12] To clarify the concept of the “generic cluster”, suppose that one solves
the self-consistent KS-LSDA equations for a spherical simple JM cluster with jellium
radius equal to R = N 1/3rs and total number of electrons N. For a given N, these
calculations are performed for diﬀerent rs values as well as diﬀerent spin conﬁgurations
until the equilibrium rs value, ¯rs(N, ζ), corresponding to the absolute minimum-energy
conﬁguration is obtained ( See Fig. 4 of Ref.10 ). Since in the calculations one does not
use any speciﬁc parameter corresponding to a certain metal, the result does not simulate
any real cluster, and we call it an N-electron “generic cluster”. In the limit of N

is seen from the ﬁgure, the equilibrium rs value for the generic cluster approaches the bulk
value, 4.18, from the above which does not simulate the correct behavior for a real metal
cluster. It is seen that for the generic clusters the equilibrium values are greater than the
value rs = 4.18 whereas the SJM1 predicts values that are smaller than the bulk value
for Na (rs = 3.99) in agreement with the MD ﬁndings. This comparison clearly shows
that simple JM gives wrong molecular bond lengths. We have performed our calculations
based on Eq. (10) both for jellium with sharp boundary, SSPJM2, and diﬀuse jellium,
dif-SSPJM2. For our diﬀuse jellium calculations we have used the background density
with the radial dependence as[15]

where n = 3/4πr3
We have chosen t = 1 in all our diﬀuse jellium calculations and then have varied the
value of rs until the minimum energy is achieved. Figure 2(a) compares the equilibrium
rs values of neutral cesium clusters for diﬀerent sizes. It is seen that in most cases (rather
large clusters for which ζ << 1 ), the SSPJM2 and the SJM1 predict the same values
for the equilibrium rs; whereas for N = 3, 5, and 7 the SSPJM2 predicts larger values.
These larger values give rise to an alternation in the plot. The values obtained from the
dif-SSPJM2 lie below the values obtained from the SSPJM2 and the SJM1. Figure 2(b)
shows the results obtained for singly ionized cesium clusters. In this case, we see that
the alternations persist up to N=15 and have relatively large amplitudes. For N=3 i.e.,
singly ionized 4-atom cluster, the value obtained from the SSPJM2 has become larger
than the bulk value which is related to the rough evaluation of ∆rs. In Fig. 3(a) we have
shown the same quantities for neutral Na clusters. The behavior of SSPJM2 results is the
same as in Fig. 2(a) but, in the case of the dif-SSPJM2 the value for N=5 has become
nearly equal to that of N=6 and also, the value for N=3 is less than that of N=4 which
completely diﬀers from the SSPJM2 results. Also, we could not ﬁnd any ﬁnite value for
N=2 case in the dif-SSPJM2. That is, as much as we decrease the input rs value, the
total energy correspondingly decreases. This means that the surface tension dominates
the internal pressure and collapses the cluster. Of course, this is not the case in reality and
it is the consequence of the fact that here the surface thickness, t, has become comparable
to the cluster radius, R. Figure 3(b) compares the plots of average distance between the
nearest neighbors obtained from our SSPJM2 calculations and the MD calculations of
R¨othlisberger and Andreoni.[13] In order to estimate the average distance between the
nearest neighbor ions in the cluster, we have assumed a bcc structure as in the bulk of

7

q

Na. Then the shortest distance between the ions, d, is related to the lattice constant, a,
through d = a√3/2. But, in the bcc structure for Na, there are two electrons in a cell
π/3 rs. Combining these two relations results in d = √π rs. The
and therefore, a = 2
value rs = 3.99 is appropriate for room temperature (T = 300 K) which results in a value
of d = 7.07 bohrs whereas, for T = 0 K the appropriate value for rs is 3.93 which gives
rise to the value d = 6.96 bohrs. Therefore, our results should lie above the MD results
[ see Fig 15(a) of Ref. 13] because, the MD calculations have been performed for zero
temperature. In Fig. 3(c) we have shown the plots of equilibrium rs values for singly
ionized sodium clusters as functions of number of electrons, N. The behavior is more or
less the same as neutral one. Figure 4(a) compares the SSPJM2 results for neutral Al
clusters with the results obtained using the SJM1. Here, we have taken the eﬀective value
of z∗ = 1. The diamonds and squares in the plot show the physical points. The main
diﬀerence between our results and the SJM1 is in the size of the jellium atom of Al. In
Fig. 4(b) we have compared the results for singly ionized Al clusters. The results show
some diﬀerences for values of N away from shell closings. Looking at the above-mentioned
ﬁgures, we note that in all the three cases of Cs, Na, and Al the SSPJM2 results in a larger
or equal values for the average distance than the SJM1, and in addition show alternations
for small clusters.

Finally, in Fig. 5(a) we have compared the plots of the total energies per electron in
the two schemes of the SSPJM2 and the SSPJM1 for Na clusters. It is seen that in the
SSPJM2 the energies are relatively lower than those of the SSPJM1 for smaller clusters
but the same for larger ones. We have also calculated the ionization energies of the clusters
using the dif-SSPJM2 and and compared with the dif-SSPJM1 and experimental values
in Fig. 5(b). Here also the odd-even alternations show up themselves in the SSPJM2 as
well as in the dif-SSPJM2 results and the values obtained are more or less the same as in
the dif-SSPJM1 [see Fig. 7(c) of Ref. 8]. Therefore, the SSPJM2 calculations for simple
metal clusters has improved the previous work, SSPJM1, in that it not only reproduces
the odd-even alternations in the ionization energies, but also it gives correct behavior for
the equilibrium sizes of the clusters.

4 Summary and Conclusion

In this work we have performed the SSPJM calculations as in the case of ab initio molecular
structure calculations. That is, we have ﬁrstly calculated the stabilizing core radius of
the pseudopotential, rB
c , for the bulk system with nonzero spin polarization. Then, using
this value in the energy functional of a cluster with given values of N and ζ, the energy

8

becomes a function of the single variable rs, the density parameter of the uniform jellium
background. Minimizing this function with respect to rs gives us the equilibrium rs
value and energy of the cluster with that speciﬁed N and ζ. Our self-consistent KS-
LSDA calculations show that the equilibrium conﬁguration is one in which the spins are
maximally compensated as in our previous ﬁndings.[8] This maximum spin compensation
gives rise to the odd-even alternations seen in the experimental ionization energy plot of
alkali metal clusters. Calculating the average distance between the nearest neighbors of
Na clusters, we ﬁnd a good agreement between our SSPJM2 results and those obtained
from MD calculations. We have therefore improved our previous SSPJM1 results in that
the odd-even property is kept the same as before but here, the sizes of the smaller clusters
have been predicted correctly.

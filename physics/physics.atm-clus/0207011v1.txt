Enhanced ionization in small rare gas clusters

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

A detailed theoretical investigation of rare gas atom clusters under intense short laser pulses
reveals that the mechanism of energy absorption is akin to enhanced ionization ﬁrst discovered for
diatomic molecules. The phenomenon is robust under changes of the atomic element (neon, argon,
krypton, xenon), the number of atoms in the cluster (16 to 30 atoms have been studied) and the
ﬂuency of the laser pulse. In contrast to molecules it does not dissappear for circular polarization.
We develop an analytical model relating the pulse length for maximum ionization to characteristic
parameters of the cluster.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Building the bridge between atomic and solid state
physics, cluster physics has become a vivid research ﬁeld
of its own. While the static properties of clusters are
by now well understood, there remain many open prob-
lems concerning the dynamics of clusters under external
perturbations. In the case of weak perturbations, linear
response theory has proven to be a valid tool for the in-
vestigation of dynamical properties [1]; but with increas-
ing strength of the perturbation the description of the
cluster evolution becomes more and more involved [2].

On the other hand, experimental studies of (mostly)
rare gas cluster interaction with highly charged projec-
tiles as well as with short,
intense laser pulses have
produced a number of interesting results calling for an
explanation. Experiments exploring the interaction of
rare gas clusters with intense laser light have shown a
big increase of energy absorption compared to the sin-
gle atom case [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. When irradiated with
a 1015W/cm2 femtosecond laser whose wavelength is in
the optical regime, one observes, depending on the clus-
ter size and the atomic element, ionic charge states of up
to 40. These high charge states let the fragmenting ions
gain an enormous amount of kinetic energy. The most
spectacular example for this highly energetic process has
certainly been the recent experimental observation of nu-
clear fusion in a cluster [9].

Here, we focus on clusters of some 10 atoms. We have
developed a model containing the essential features of the
interaction between the cluster and the laser ﬁeld. It will
be shown that energy absorption from the laser pulse pro-
ceeds through a mechanism originally discovered for di-
atomic molecules (enhanced ionization (ENIO) [10, 11]),
whose generalization for the case of small clusters will be
presented.

The paper is organized as follows: after introducing
the numerical model and comparing it to other types of
simulations already existing in the literature in section II,
we investigate the dependence of energy absorption and
ionization yield on the pulse length in a series of clusters
in section III. From the results of these calculations a
generic behavior emerges which can be explained by in-

voking the above-mentioned enhanced ionization mecha-
nism as explained in section IV. We give strong evidence
that this mechanism should play an important role in the
laser-cluster interaction over a large range of parameters
detailed in section V. Finally we condense our picture of
the ionization process into a simple analytical expression
which quantiﬁes the role of the experimentally accessible
variables like cluster size or atomic element on the pro-
cess of energy absorption in section VI. The last section
VII summarizes our work. Atomic units are used if not
stated otherwise.

II. THE CLUSTER MODEL

A. Theoretical formulation and numerical
implementation

Since the dimension of the problem is far too high to al-
low for an exact quantum mechanical treatment we have
formulated a model to describe the dynamics of rare gas
clusters in strong laser ﬁelds. We resort to a classical
treatment, with a few but essential quantum mechanical
elements.

Initially, before the onset of the laser pulse, we ﬁnd
the equilibrium ground state conﬁguration of the clus-
ter with Lennard-Jones interaction between the neutral
cluster atoms. The global minima for this potential are
readily available. The electrons are assumed to be local-
ized at the nuclei.

After ﬁxing the initial shape of the cluster, we start
the time evolution switching on the laser pulse [12]. For
the electrons, this evolution consists of two parts: ﬁrstly,
the modeling of the bound state and the process of ion-
ization from this state; secondly, the propagation after
being ionized from an atom. We will refer to the ﬁrst
process as inner ionization, in contrast to the outer ion-
ization, which has the eﬀect that an electron leaves the
cluster. Inner ionization contains processes beyond clas-
sical mechanics, while the subsequent propagation and
(eventually) outer ionization is described classically via
integration of Newton’s equations.

When irradiating a cluster with intense laser light, two
processes can lead, at least in principle, to inner ioniza-

tion: ﬁeld ionization and electron impact ionization. In
the case of ﬁeld ionization, the electric ﬁeld inside the
cluster (initially only the laser ﬁeld, later the combined
ﬁeld of laser, ions and electrons) leads to a lowering of
the potential barriers, so that an electron can leave its
mother atom via tunneling [13] or even over-the-barrier
[14]. Electrons which are already inner ionized, but not
yet outer ionized, can further lead to electron impact
ionization. This mechanism was shown to play almost
no role in small clusters [15], as the average free path
length with respect to electron impact ionization is much
larger than the cluster radius. For this reason we only
consider ﬁeld ionization in our model.

The model is implemented as follows. Before the onset
of the pulse, the electrons of the cluster are assumed to be
localized at the atomic positions; the bare nucleus and all
the electrons of an atom are treated as one neutral clas-
sical particle. It is only later that the electrons (through
inner ionization) are born as separate classical particles.
Hence, the number of particles in our simulation changes
with time.

where Z1 and Z2 are the charges of the two particles. The
aZi are softcore parameters, which help to regularize the
Coulomb singularity. We are using a Z-dependent a, so
that the depth of the atomic potential can be adjusted to
the current binding energy. To determine aZ, we proceed
as follows:

(cid:17)

– For electrons, a has been chosen to be 0.1,

i.e.

a−1 = 0.1

the potential of an atom with charge Z, we demand

Hence, the atomic energy level is shifted by the surround-

atom from which the electron will be ionized has to be
subtracted because its inﬂuence is already contained in
EAtom
. The positions r1 and r2, where En crosses the

potential curve V (r), are determined numerically; the
search for r2 is continued until I(t) < 10−10. If we ﬁnd a
position r′ along the direction of ~B with dV /dr
|r=r′ = 0
r′, over-the-barrier ionization is

ing rate w(t) is then the tunneling probability I(t) mul-
tiplied with the frequency of the electron hitting the po-
tential barrier. In a semiclassical picture, this frequency
is just the inverse of the Kepler period Tn belonging to
an orbit with binding energy En:

≤

Tn = π(ZAtom + 1)/(2E3

Hence, the tunneling rate is

w(t) = I(t)/Tn.

The tunneling probability over a unit of time dt is
P (t) = w(t) dt. By comparison with a random number
z (is P (t) > z?) we decide if the electron in question
tunnels. If so, we place the electron, which now becomes
a classical particle, outside the potential barrier as close
to r2 as possible, with the exact position and momentum
of the electron determined by conservation of the total

If the ionization happens to be over-the-
barrier, we put the electron on top of the barrier, where
dV /dr = 0. The atomic charge is raised by 1 and the
next virtual electron is allowed to tunnel.

The particles are classically propagated by integrating
Newton’s equations of motion. We have used a symplec-
tic integrator [17] with a time step of dt = 0.1.

B. A typical run

Although later we will use a Monte Carlo ensemble
to calculate experimentally accessible observables, for a
qualitative understanding of the phenomena it is suﬃ-
cient to have a closer look on a single event, since the
overall behavior of the ensemble members is quite sim-
ilar. As an example we consider a Ne16-cluster. The
applied pulse has a peak intensity of I = 1015 W/cm2, a
frequency of ω = 0.055 a.u. (780 nm) and it extends over
55 fs.

which have left the cluster, as a function of time. After
approximately 750 fs the intensity of the laser is suﬃ-
ciently high for the ﬁrst inner ionization event, followed
by a rapid increase of the number of classical particles as
well as the cluster charge. Obviously, the ionization of
the ﬁrst few electrons leads to an ‘avalanche eﬀect’: the
inner ionized electrons create a strong electric ﬁeld inside
the cluster, which helps to inner ionize further electrons
(this is reminiscent of the ionization ignition mechanism
[18]).

Fig. 3 shows the energy absorbed by the cluster and
the mean interionic distance, again as a function of time.
If K is the set of nuclei with mass M , E the set of inner
ionized electrons (mass m) already treated classically and
G the set of electrons which are still bound, the cluster

The absorbed energy is the diﬀerence of the total energies
before and after the laser pulse. As we can see, this rather
small cluster can already absorb a considerable amount
of energy. The oscillations are due to the ponderomotive
potential and have no direct inﬂuence on the net energy
absorption. As the cluster gets charged, it begins to ex-
pand, i.e. the mean interionic distance will increase. For
a cluster consisting of N atoms, it is deﬁned as

At the intensity used here, the cluster disintegrates
completely, i.e. we observe only atomic fragments after
the pulse. Note that the expansion of the cluster takes
place adiabatically compared to the time scales of the
laser frequency and the electronic motion, but on the
same time scale as the pulse length. Hence, it is possible
to explore radius-dependent properties of the cluster by
varying the pulse length.

C. Comparison to other models

Similar models for the theoretical description of small
rare gas clusters in strong laser ﬁelds have been proposed
by other authors. The common feature is the use of clas-
sical mechanics as the basic ingredient of the description;
the main diﬀerences lie in the treatment of inner ioniza-
tion.

electron which can be inner ionized. However, tunnel-
ing is not included. Instead, the active electron circles
its mother ion on a Kepler orbit with an energy cor-
responding to the quantum mechanical binding energy.
This orbit is then deformed in time by the laser ﬁeld and
the surrounding charges, and inner ionization can take
place, which is deﬁned by reaching a certain distance rc
from the mother ion.
If the electron exceeds this dis-
tance, it is assumed to be inner ionized, and the next
electron is put onto a (now deeper bound) Kepler orbit.
inner ionization takes
place sequentially, and the already inner ionized electrons
are propagated classically. By neglecting any tunneling
contributions, the ﬁrst inner ionization will take place a
certain time δt later than in our case. As we will see,
this delay can have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the subse-
quent dynamics of the cluster rendering a fully classical
treatment as in the onion model problematic.

In common with our model,

2. Tunneling via the Landau rate

In this ansatz [19] the tunneling mechanism is taken
into account, but the tunneling integral is not calculated
explicitely. Instead, the time dependent tunneling prob-

4

ability is estimated using the Landau tunneling rate [20],
which has been established for the case of an atom in a
quasistatic laser ﬁeld. For this purpose, the total electric
ﬁeld (laser + electrons + ions) at the position of an atom
is used. For inner ionization to happen in this model the
ﬁeld strength has to be strong enough at just one point,
namely, the position of the atom. Hence, an electron
which comes by chance close to an ion will create locally
such a strong ﬁeld that ionization can hardly be avoided.
In our model, in contrast, the entire environment of an
atom must be suitable for ionization. Consequently, we
get lower ionization rates than in [19] but in better agree-
ment with [15].

3. Using the full Coulomb potential

In a third model [15], the full tunneling integral is cal-
culated at each time step as in our case. Moreover, the
authors do not use a softcore potential but employ the
full Coulomb potential and regularize the singular equa-
tions of motion. The use of the full Coulomb potential
may, at ﬁrst glance, seem to be an advantage. However,
it leads to the problem of classical autoionization: a clas-
sical electron in a Coulomb potential can be arbitrarily
deeply bound, since there is no uncertainty relation. The
corresponding energy gained is available as kinetic energy
for the ionization of other electrons. In our model, this
unphysical behavior is avoided by requiring the minimum
of the softcore potential to coincide with the quantum
mechanical binding energy.

In [15] a recapture mechanism was built in to account
for this problem, which can transform already classically
treated electrons back into a virtual bound state exis-
tence. Not to mention the peculiarities which arise when
deﬁning the exact conditions for recapture in a many-
particle environment, the numerical expenditure is higher
than in our case. Nevertheless, the ionization yields cal-
culated with this model agree quite well with our results.

III. ABSORPTION PROPERTIES FOR
DIFFERENT PULSE LENGTHS

To investigate how the expansion of a cluster during
the interaction with a strong laser pulse inﬂuences its ab-
sorption behavior, we have calculated the absorbed en-
ergy and the average ionic charges after the interaction
for various pulse lengths. To keep the amount of energy
delivered by these pulses ﬁxed, we demand the ﬂuency to
be constant, i.e.

for diﬀerent clusters, see Fig. 4. The solid lines are to guide
the eye.

For the reference pulse, we chose the parameters already
used in the single run from the previous section: F = 0.16
a.u., ω = 0.055 a.u. and a pulse length of 20 cycles.
Shorter pulses have a higher maximum ﬁeld strength and
longer pulses a lower maximum ﬁeld strength, respec-
tively. The results were obtained by averaging over a
Monte Carlo ensemble consisting of 20 clusters.

A. The light Ne16 cluster: almost atomic behavior

The ﬁrst cluster we consider is Ne16. The absorbed
energy and the average atomic charges as a function of
pulse length under the constraint of Eq. (13) are shown
in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively.

Both curves decrease monotonically with increasing
pulse length. The average atomic charge exhibits a
plateau for pulse lengths around T = 3000 a.u.. At this
point, we can already suspect that the plateau might have
its origin in the expansion of the cluster during the pulse.
However, in the case of Ne16 its eﬀect seems to be rather
small. In fact, Neon clusters of this size behave more like

atoms. This changes for heavier rare gases.

5

B. Generic cluster behavior in Ar16

The absorbed energy (Fig. 4) and average atomic
charge (Fig. 5) for an Ar16 cluster decrease monotoni-
cally for very short pulse lengths only. Both quantities
2000 a.u., reaching a maxi-
start to rise again for T
mum at an optimal pulse length of T
4500 a.u. (we will
refer to this optimal pulse length as T ∗ subsequently) be-
fore they ultimately decrease. The average charge state
reached at T = T ∗ is around 4.5, which is considerably
higher than what one would expect from a single Argon
atom.

≈

≈

The maximum is much more pronounced for the ion-
ization yield than for the absorbed energy for two rea-
sons. Firstly, for shorter pulses the mean internuclear
distance just after the pulse will in general be smaller
than for longer pulses, so that the Coulomb explosion
energy will increase with decreasing pulse length. Sec-
ondly, the ionized electrons, which can be considered to
be quasi-free, acquire a higher kinetic energy for shorter
pulses, since the intensity is higher than for longer pulses.
These two eﬀects wash out the minimum in the curve for
the absorbed energy and decrease the contrast between
minimum and maximum.

We will postpone the further discussion and explana-
tion of this structure after we have taken a look at the
corresponding results for Kr16 and Xe16.

C. Same qualitative behavior as for Argon: Kr16
and Xe16

Qualitatively, the behavior for Kr16 as well as for Xe16
is the same as for Ar16: the energy absorption and the
average atomic charge peak for a certain pulse length T ∗,
which depends on the type of the cluster. The average
atomic charge increases with the atomic mass, reaching
an average of almost 7+ for the Xe16 cluster; this is of
course due to the decreasing binding energies of the elec-
trons in the heavier elements. The value of T ∗ is chang-
ing for diﬀerent clusters; we will come back to this point
later, after we have understood the reason for the exis-
tence of T ∗.

IV. CALCULATIONS WITH FIXED NUCLEI

The existence of an optimal pulse length T ∗ can be re-
lated to an optimal cluster geometry with critical radius
R∗, which maximizes the energy absorption (and also the
ionization) of a small rare gas cluster in a strong ﬁeld.
Given the existence of such a critical radius, which should
be larger than the equilibrium radius R0, the occurrence
of T ∗ can be readily explained.

For very short pulse lengths, the cluster has almost
no time to expand during the pulse, so that the critical
radius will be reached only well after the pulse is already
switched oﬀ. For longer and longer pulses, the cluster
will reach R∗ at earlier and earlier times. For a certain
pulse length T ∗, the time of reaching R∗ will roughly
coincide with the maximum of the pulse, which leads
to optimal absorption. If the pulses are becoming even
longer, R∗ will be reached already before the maximum of
the pulse and the maximum intensity is decreasing due to
the energy normalization (Eq. (13)). Both eﬀects lead to
a decrease in energy absorption as well as in the average
atomic ionization for T > T ∗.

What remains to be shown is that the critical radius
R∗ really exists and to explain its origin. To this end, we
have calculated the cluster ionization yield for diﬀerent,
but ﬁxed cluster radii. We have accomplished this by
applying a scaling transformation

~R0

i ⇒

λ ~R0

(15)

to the atomic positions, with λ = 1 corresponding to the
ground state conﬁguration. The pulse we use is the ref-
erence pulse for the calculations of the last section, i.e.
of the form Eq. (9) with F = 0.16 a.u., ω = 0.055 a.u.
and 20 cycles length. The results of these calculations
are shown in Fig. 6. For all four clusters under con-
sideration, we observe the existence of a critical radius
R∗ [21], which is larger than the equilibrium one. This
means that it will be reached during the expansion the
clusters undergo when irradiated with intense laser light.
The results of the previous section thus can indeed be ex-
plained by the existence of R∗. The question remaining
to be settled is: which mechanism is responsible for R∗?
In principle, two possibilities are available: ﬁrst, it could
be a resonance eﬀect where the electrons inside the clus-
ter oscillate at a certain characteristic frequency which
would coincide with the laser frequency at a certain clus-
ter size. This kind of mechanism is well known from the

6

plasmon resonance in metal clusters [22]; being originally
a weak-ﬁeld-concept, the plasmon has been claimed to
play an important role also in the strong ﬁeld regime [3].
However, one needs a delocalized electron cloud to create
a plasmon resonance; in rare gas clusters, this condition
is not fulﬁlled.

The second mechanism would be a generalization of
a concept ﬁrst discovered for linear, diatomic molecules
[10, 11, 23], called enhanced ionization (ENIO). It can be
qualitatively explained by looking at the potential curve
of such a molecule exposed to a quasistatic electric ﬁeld
(see Fig. 7): the upper energy level of the two levels
1σ+ and 1σ−, which emanate from the bonding and the
antibonding molecular orbital when an electric ﬁeld is
switched on, will lie above the inner potential barrier but
below the outer potential barrier when the internuclear
distance R is rather small. On the other hand, when R
is rather large, the level will lie below the inner barrier
but above the outer barrier (using the terms introduced
in the previous section, we can say that inner ionization
is easier than outer ionization for small R and vice versa
for large R). For an intermediate value of R, typically
around 6-8 a.u., the interplay between inner and outer
ionization will lead to a maximum in the ionization rate.

This mechanism has been shown to be operative not
only in linear molecules, but also in triatomic molecules
of triangular shape [24, 25]. In this case, the simple pic-
ture of Fig. 7 is already slightly distorted, and it is more
appropriate to think of enhanced ionization in terms of
an optimal balance between inner and outer ionization,
which makes the generalization of the mechanism to a
true many-body system like a cluster much easier.

One characteristic feature of the enhanced ionization
mechanism is its relative insensitivity on the frequency
of the applied laser ﬁeld. As long as the quasistatic
picture is valid, the value of R∗ should not change sig-
niﬁcantly with the laser frequency. On the other hand,
any resonance-type mechanism like the plasmon picture
should exhibit a strong dependence of R∗ on the laser fre-
quency. We have calculated the ionization yield of Ne16
and Ar16 for three diﬀerent frequencies, with the results
shown in Fig. 8. The position of R∗ does hardly change
for diﬀerent laser frequencies. Hence, we can exclude any
kind of resonance behavior in favor of the enhanced ion-
ization mechanism.

Although the position of R∗ does not change with the
laser frequency, the ionization yield does. This is due
to the fact that electrons which are already outer ionized
tend to leave the cluster region faster when the frequency
is smaller: the quiver amplitude of an electron in an elec-
tric ﬁeld of frequency ω is proportional to 1/ω2. Hence,
on average in ﬁelds of higher frequencies the already ion-
ized electrons will stay closer to the cluster for a longer
time and lead to an increased ﬁeld ionization rate.

V. EXPLORATION OF THE PARAMETERS
CONTROLLING LASER-CLUSTER
INTERACTION

we will explore now the inﬂuence of diﬀerent parameters
on this mechanism, such as cluster size, energy content
of the laser pulse and laser polarization.

A. Diﬀerent cluster sizes

As in the previous section, we present the cluster re-
sponse with ﬁxed nuclei ﬁrst and relate the results of
these calculations to the absorption behavior when the
nuclei are allowed to move. The average atomic charge
and the absorbed energy were calculated as a function of
the mean interionic distance again, analogous to section
IV. The equilibrium value R0 does hardly change when
going to bigger clusters. The variation of R0 for Ne16,
Ne20, Ne25 and Ne30 is only about 0.01 a.u.. We have
used the same pulse as in section IV. As can be seen
from Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the bigger clusters show almost
no diﬀerence compared to Ne16 when the observables are
normalized on the number of cluster atoms. In particular
the existence of a critical distance R∗ > R0 is conﬁrmed
in all cases.

Having established the basic mechanism for coupling
energy from the laser pulse into small rare gas clusters,

There is no hint on a transition to a collective behavior
at these cluster sizes. If we think of cluster physics as the

so that ﬁnally

transition regime between atomic and solid state physics,
we are still on the atomic side with a cluster of 30 atoms.
From the fact that the charge per atom is almost in-
dependent of the number of cluster atoms we may con-
clude that only the next-neighbor-atoms participate in
the mechanism of enhanced ionization; otherwise the ef-
fectivity of this mechanism should change with the clus-
ter size. The absorbed energy per atom, however, is vary-
ing with the number of atoms. This eﬀect can be easily
explained by calculating the change in the potential en-
ergy U (N ) of a cluster consisting of N ions of charge Z
and radius R if one adds a new ion with the same charge
Z to the cluster.
If one assumes that this new ion is
placed at the border of the cluster, then

U (N + 1) = U (N ) + N Z 2/R.

(16)

s denotes the volume per atom, then R = N 1/3rs

If 4πr3
and

U (N + 1) = U (N ) + N 2/3Z 2/rs.

(17)

With N as a continuous variable one is left with the dif-
ferential equation

=

N 2/3Z 2

,

U (N ) =

5

N 5/3Z 2
rs

.

(18)

(19)

Hence, the potential energy per atom U/N has increases
with N 2/3 if the charge per atom is independent of N .

Proceeding from Ne to Ar clusters, one ﬁnds again
that the eﬀectivity of the ionization mechanism hardly
changes when changing the cluster size, while the ab-
sorbed energy per atom increases with N , for the same
reason as discussed above (see Fig. 11 and Fig. 12). How-
ever, while the Ne clusters show only a little shift of R∗ as
a function of cluster size, the ratio of R∗ to R0 increases
slightly more with increasing N for Ar. This is probably
due to a larger downshift of the atomic energy levels by
the increased total amount of surrounding charge when
N is increased. As can be seen from Fig. 7, a downshift
of the atomic energy levels leads to an increase in R∗.
Since the electron release in argon clusters is larger than
in Ne clusters higher charged ions are generated than in
neon clusters rendering this eﬀect more pronounced for
Ar clusters.

Since we have found a critical cluster radius R∗ with
R∗ > R0 in all cases considered, it is not too surprising
that we ﬁnd a behavior analogous to the small clusters
of Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 if the bigger clusters are allowed
to expand freely. The results of these calculations, with
the pulse normalization being identical to section III, are
shown in Fig. 13 and Fig. 14. For clarity, we have plotted
the total cluster charge instead of the average atomic
charge, which is almost the same independent of N .

The overall structure of the curves is seen to be quite
similar throughout the diﬀerent cluster sizes, as one
would expect from Fig. 9 and Fig. 11. In the case of Ne
clusters, the plateau which has been observed for Ne16
already in Fig. 5 goes over into a small maximum with
increasing N , which indicates that the enhanced ioniza-
tion mechanism is slightly more eﬃcient for larger clus-
ters when the ions are allowed to move. One tendency
which can be observed for the Ar clusters is that T ∗ in-
creases with increasing N . We have seen in Fig. 11 that
R∗ increases also with N , so that the larger Ar clusters
have to travel a longer distance until they reach the crit-
ical radius. For the Ne clusters, on the contrary, the
curves show almost no shift in the T -direction when N
is changed. We will investigate the dependence of the
expansion process on the various cluster parameters like
size and atom charge in closer detail in section VI.

B. The inﬂuence of the pulse normalization

Changing the laser intensity I in the case of H+

2 , with
just a single electron available, leads to a decrease of
R∗ when I is increased and vice versa [26]. For clusters

the situation is much more complicated because with in-
creasing I lower lying energy levels will be ionized, so
that it is a priori not clear in which way a change of
the laser intensity (in a calculation with ﬁxed nuclei) will
inﬂuence the value of R∗. Fig. 15 shows the static ion-
ization yields for Ne16, Ar16, Kr16 and Xe16 under the
inﬂuence of the pulse used so far (i.e. a peak intensity
1014W/cm2), compared to the result of a
of I1 = 8.99
·
1015W/cm2 (in both cases the
calculation with I2 = 2.19
pulse was of the form Eq. (9) with ω = 0.055 a.u. and
T = 55 fs). In all four cases R∗ is larger than R0 and
can be reached by cluster expansion. The value of R∗
is, if at all, only slightly decreased in the case of higher
intensity: due to the large number of electrons involved
the geometry of the problem is obviously not as sensitive
to the laser ﬁeld strength as in the H+

·

2 case.

Of course, the ionization yield is higher when the inten-
sity is increased. This leads to signiﬁcantly shorter ex-
pansion times when the nuclei are allowed to move. Con-
sequently, the optimal pulse lengths T ∗ are now shifted
towards smaller values, as can be seen in Fig. 16 in ac-

cordance with our picture of the ionization process.

C. Enhanced ionization and circular polarization

So far all the results presented are expected to hold
also for diatomic molecules. One main diﬀerence between
such a molecule and a cluster is the molecular axis: the
whole picture of ENIO as sketched in Fig. 7 relies on the
fact that the polarization direction of the applied laser
ﬁeld coincides with the internuclear axis. And indeed,
experiments as well as calculations with a polarization
axis perpendicular to the molecular axis have shown no
signature of enhanced ionization [24, 27]. For the same
reason ENIO is much less eﬃcient under circular polar-
ization.

On the other hand, a cluster is (in ﬁrst approximation)
spherically symmetric. Thus one would expect enhanced
ionization to work also with circularly polarized light. To
test this hypothesis, we have performed the same calcula-
tions as in the previous sections, but now with circularly
polarized laser light. We have chosen the ﬁeld strength
of the laser such that the energy content of a pulse with
a certain pulse length T remains constant when passing
from linear to circular polarization: if

F0 sin2(π/T t) sin(ωt)~ex

(20)

is a laser pulse with linear polarization in x-direction,
then

F0/√2 sin2(π/T t) (sin(ωt)~ex + cos(ωt)~ey)

(21)

is the corresponding circularly polarized pulse. With this
deﬁnition the maximum ﬁeld strength is decreased by a
factor of √2. As expected, ENIO also exists for circu-
larly polarized laser pulses. Fig. 17 shows the calcula-
tions with ﬁxed nuclei, Fig. 18 the corresponding results
with moving nuclei. In the case of static nuclei, we ﬁnd
that the ionization yield in the critical regime is almost
as high for circular as for linear polarization (Fig. 6),

in sharp contrast to the above-mentioned results for di-
atomic molecules. Consequently, when the nuclei are
allowed to move we also get qualitatively the same re-
sults (Fig. 18) as with linear polarization (Fig. 5).
It
is only for rather long pulses that in the case of Ne16
and Ar16 the ionization yield is signiﬁcantly lower than
in the linear case, which is due to the reduced maximum
ﬁeld strength. Summarizing our exploration of diﬀerent
parameters we ﬁnd that ENIO for clusters is a rather ro-
bust phenomenon. This has motivated us to ask if the
optimum pulse length T ∗ can be quantitatively linked to
the critical radius R∗.

VI. ANALYTICAL FORMULA FOR THE
COULOMB EXPLOSION

To isolate the relation of T ∗ to R∗ we divide the time-
dependent dynamics into three diﬀerent phases: phase I
denotes the time from the onset of the laser pulse until
50% of the atoms in the cluster have lost one electron due

to inner ionization. We will refer to this time as T0 sub-
sequently. Since some of the inner ionized electrons will
leave the cluster, we can say that T0 marks the beginning
of the expansion process.

In this ﬁrst phase inner ionization is dominated by
atomic processes, the environment plays only a minor
role. For a single atom/ion the time-dependent proba-
bility that the active electron is not yet ionized reads, in
terms of the ﬁeld- and binding energy dependent ioniza-
tion rate w(f (t), Eb)

Pneutral(t) = exp

w(f (t′), Eb) dt′

,

(22)

t

−

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where Eb denotes the binding energy. The probability
that in a cluster consisting of N such atoms no electron
has been ionized is given by

P cluster
neutral(t) = [Pneutral(t)]N .

(23)

The exponential dependence on N renders P cluster
neutral(t)
practically a step function. Hence, the exact value (be-
tween zero and one) for the deﬁnition of T0 is not rele-
vant. We determine T0 from P cluster
neutral(T0) = 1/2 which is
tantamount to demanding that on average 50 % of the
atoms in the cluster are singly ionized at T0.

The second phase contains the cluster expansion up to
the critical time T ∗, when the critical cluster radius R∗
is reached. Hence, the critical time is the sum of T0 and
the expansion time Texp:

T ∗ = T0 + Texp.

(24)

The third phase is ﬁnally the time from reaching R∗ to
the end of the pulse. A schematic picture of the diﬀerent
phases is shown in Fig. 19.

From T0 until the end of the pulse, the total cluster
charge increases from Z = N/2 to Z = Zﬁnal. As a
ﬁrst approximation, we assume that the expansion from
R = R0 to R = R∗ is driven by an eﬀective charge
per atom ¯Z = αZﬁnal/N with a constant factor α which
stands for the eﬃciency of the enhanced ionization mech-
anism. Furthermore, the expansion is assumed to be ac-
complished by the Coulomb repulsion of the nuclei only,

11

(26)

(27)

(28)

i.e. we neglect the inﬂuence of the laser ﬁeld as well as of
the electronic dynamics on the expansion process. Under
these two assumptions, we can use energy conservation

between two ions in V0, with the cluster radius R (which

on the surface of the cluster), we can estimate how this

expansion is governed by the factor N/(N
1), which
depends only weakly on N . This leads us to the conclu-
sion that indeed the increase of T ∗ with N in Fig. 14 is
not due to the expansion process but due to the increase
of R∗ with N only (see Fig. 11).

−

A. Scaling of the optimal pulse length

With Eq. (29) at hand we are able to set up a relation
between the optimal pulse lengths for various cluster if
we make one last assumption: the factor α, which de-
termines the ratio between the average atomic charge ¯Z
driving the expansion up to R∗ and the ﬁnal charge per
atom after the pulse, Zﬁnal/N , is identical for all clusters.
α would be a univer-
If this hypothesis was true, then 1
sal measure for the eﬃciency of the ENIO mechanism.

−

−

If α is the same for all clusters, we get from Eq. (29)
a linear relation between the expansion time Texp and
f (λ)(T0/V0)1/2, diﬀerent for each cluster. This predic-
tion is conﬁrmed by Fig. 20 which shows the expansion
times Texp = T ∗/2
T0 as a function of the cluster-
dependent values of (K0/V0)1/2f (λ) for diﬀerent clusters.
We have obtained λ from the respective static calcula-
tions for each cluster. A linear ﬁt to the data yields
α = 0.38 and α = 0.37 for energy normalized pulses at
F0 = 0.16 and F0 = 0.25, respectively. The correlation
coeﬃcient is in both cases higher than 0.99. Hence, α
is the same for diﬀerent clusters, and it is even almost
the same for diﬀerent energy normalizations of the laser

12

pulse. This result a posteriori justiﬁes the approxima-
tions we have made in establishing our expansion model.
The fact that α remains almost the same when chang-
ing the pulse normalization is certainly an unexpected
result; it is probably valid only for a limited range of
pulse energy contents, if one thinks of α as a measure
for the eﬃciency of ENIO. At least in the limit of a very
large pulse energy, when the electric ﬁeld of the laser
is larger than the electric ﬁeld from the charges in the
cluster, we expect the ENIO mechanism to play no im-
portant role any more, since the cluster geometry will be
washed out. However, the good agreement of the linear
ﬁt in Fig. 20 with our numerical data for each of the two
normalizations separately points to a deeper scaling re-
lation between the various clusters, the reason for which
will be explored in future work.

VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

We have developed a quasiclassical model for small rare
gas cluster in strong laser ﬁelds. This model allows us to
investigate the inﬂuence of several parameters, like the
atomic element and the cluster size, but also the charac-
teristica of the applied laser ﬁeld. We have shown that, as
a function of pulse length, the energy absorption as well
as the ionization yield of all but the Ne clusters show a
clear maximum when the energy content of the pulse is
kept ﬁxed. This behavior has been attributed to the ex-
istence of a critical cluster radius R∗, whose origin could
be explained by generalizing the CREI or ENIO concept
from diatomic molecules to small rare gas clusters. It was
shown that this mechanism is stable against a change of
system parameters, even when switching from linear to
circular polarization. This is a pronounced diﬀerence be-
tween clusters and molecules.

Finally, we were able to condense the absorption and
expansion process into a simple model and obtained an
analytical expression connecting the expansion time and
the cluster properties. The validity of this expression has
been conﬁrmed by our numerical data.

≈

Future investigations will include the transition to the
plasma regime, which we expect to begin at around
103. In this regime, another critical radius should
N
emerge, when the laser frequency matches the plasma fre-
quency. It will be interesting to see how this additional
critical radius evolves with N and if there is a regime
where the R∗ coming from the ENIO process and the
plasma related R∗

c coexist.

We would like the DFG for ﬁnancial support within

the Gerhard Hess-program.

[16] Energy conservation is not automatically guaranteed by
just placing the electron at r2 with no kinetic energy,
as one might suspect from Fig. 1. The reason is that the
ionic softcore parameter is Z-dependent and, in addition,
diﬀers from the softcore parameter of an electron.

Abstract

We report all-electron, density-functional calculations with large Gaussian polariza-
tion basis set of the recently synthesized octahedral O B24N24 cage that is perfectly
round by symmetry, and boron-nitride (BN) clusters that its existence might sug-
gest. We consider whether it is energetically possible that the two halves of this
round cage could cap the BN nanotubes, modeled by B28N28 and B32N32 . The
energetics show that BN nanotubes with such round caps, are only slightly less
favorable than the BN clusters containing six squares as the only defects in the
otherwise perfect hexagonal lattice. A larger B96N96 O cage formed from B24N24 by
adding suﬃcient hexagons to isolate all squares is not very favorable energetically.

Boron-nitride clusters have been made by vacuum arc melting, dissolved in
pyridine, and detected using time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy, which shows
that the B24N24 cluster is made in abundance [1]. Its structure is likely to
be the largest, and thus most round, alternate boron-nitride (BN) cage in
which all atom pairs are equivalent by octahedral symmetry, in analogy to the
icosahedral C60 cluster. The latter cluster is a fullerene, which is a hexagonal
graphite sheet made to close into a cage by twelve pentagons as required by
Euler’s theorem [2], for which there are no alternate BN cages [3]. Alternate
BN cages are made by substituting alternate sp2 carbon atoms of certain

fullerene-like cages with boron and nitrogen atoms. These cages contain only
squares, hexagons, octagons, etc., and only strong BN nearest-neighbor bonds.
The simplest and most stable alternate BN cages contain hexagons that are
closed by exactly six isolated squares [4]. However, B24N24 is the alternate
cage for the perfectly round C48 cluster with Oh symmetry [5]. Both are made
round by the addition of twelve defects–six octagons and the corresponding
six squares required by Euler’s theorem. When made from carbon this cluster
is quite unfavorable [6], but apparently not when made from boron nitride.
Our calculations show that the B24N24 cage containing six squares isolated by
hexagons is about 4-5 eV lower than the octahedral B24N24 cage[4]. Perhaps
BN cages are almost as versatile as fullerene cages; that could be the case if
defects in boron nitride cages cost signiﬁcantly less energy than they do in
fullerene cages.

A study of the smaller fullerenes suggests that it is never favorable to replace,
in the context of Euler’s theorem, two pentagons with a single square [7].
So in carbon cages squares are likely to be twice as energetically unfavorable
as pentagons, which cost, when isolated, at least 2.3 eV each [8]. Heptagons
and octagon are less energetically favorable in carbon cages, but are required
to bend and twist free-standing nanotubes [8]. The energetics of fullerenes if
applied to B24N24 would argue strongly against its existence.

The most abundant fullerenes are buckminsterfullerene, C60, and C70. The
latter can be viewed as being formed by cutting buckminsterfullerene into
hemispheres in a highest-symmetry direction and inserting a ring of ten atoms,
and then rotating the top hemisphere half a revolution before reconnecting it.
It is natural to think about extending that process to larger capsules [10] and
ultimately to the (5,5) carbon nanotube in the inﬁnite limit [12,11]. Contrary
to early belief, C60 is not the most stable fullerene. The larger icosahedral
fullerenes are more stable [13], but C60 is the most stable in a wide range of
cluster sizes and shapes [14]. Perhaps perfect roundness facilitates making C60
and B24N24 .

If, on the other hand, extra defects in boron nitride fullerenes are so costly
that they never occur except in B24N24, then boron nitride caps have a very
special shape. If half a defect-free BN fullerene caps a BN nanotube just as
half a defect-free fullerene caps a carbon nanotube [15] then each BN cap
has precisely three squares. Furthermore, the three squares must lie on the
periphery of the nanotube, and, as three points determine a plane, the BN
nanotube cap must be ﬂat. Defect-free ﬂat and triangular BN caps are quite
diﬀerent from hemispherical carbon nanotube caps.

If B24N24 is spherical and under some circumstances abundant, it is natural to
ask if an additional ring of BN atoms can be added to form a less abundant but
still possible cluster that is reminiscent of C70, and if further rings are possible

to make hemispherically capped BN nanotubes. We study the energetics of
this possibility using analytic density functional theory.

Our calculations use the Slater-Roothaan method. It uses Gaussian bases to
ﬁt the orbitals and Kohn-Sham potential [16] of density-functional theory.
The method through robust and variational ﬁtting is analytic and variational
in all basis sets [17]. The most general functionals that it can treat so far
are certain variants of the Xα functional [18]. In particular, it can handle
diﬀerent α’s on diﬀerent elements analytically and variationally so that the
atomized energies of any cluster can be recovered exactly, and all energies
are accurate through ﬁrst order in any changes to any basis set. Thus the
energy does not change if we choose to constrain any ﬁt, which we do for
all ﬁts at no cost to the calculated energetics and negligible cost in com-
puter time. Our work has spawned research eﬀorts that brought both use-
ful ﬁtting techniques and density-functional theory to Gaussian-based ab ini-
tio quantum chemistry. Thus there are good basis sets for ﬁtting the Kohn-
Sham potential. The best s-type ﬁtting bases are still those scaled from the
s-part of the orbital basis [19]. A package of basis sets has been optimized
[20] for use with DGauss [21]. We use the valence double-ζ orbital basis set
DZVP2 and the pd part of the (4,3;4,3) (A2) charge density ﬁtting basis.
Ahlrichs’ group has generated a RI-J basis for ﬁtting the charge density of
a valence triple-ζ orbital basis set used in the Turbomole program [22]. We
use its pdf part with the standard 6311G** basis set downloaded from PNNL
(http://www.emsl.pnl.gov:2080/forms/basisform.html). For both sets of cal-
culations the values of α chosen for B and N are, respectively, 0.786751 and
0.767473, which give the exact atomic energies [23] when used with the triple-
ζ/RI-J basis. The accuracy of this method using Hartree-Fock values of α [24]
away from the sides of the periodic table is roughly that of Becke’s half-and-
half method [25], but as it requires no numerical integration. The method is
ideal for use with Gaussian basis sets [17]. Forces are computed nonrecursively
using the 4-j generalized Gaunt coeﬃcients [26].

The symmetry restricted optimization of the BN cages was performed using
the BFGS computer code [27]. The optimized hemispherically capped BN
nanotubes are shown in Fig. 1 while their symmetries are given in the Table
I. The (4,4) nanotubes are generated by extending along the four-fold axis
[Fig 1(b)]. The caps start oﬀ perfectly round by the symmetry of B24N24 .
They remain quite round after geometry optimization. In the ﬁgure they look
a little ﬂat at the tops and bottoms because the octagons take up a signiﬁcant
portion of their caps. The (3,3) BN nanotube generated by extending the
three-fold direction would have rounder caps, but are probably less likely to be
made because they contain signiﬁcantly more curvature. The binding energy
per BN pair (BE), the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and
the vertical ionization potential calculated at the optimized geometries are

also given in Table I.

The coordinates (in ˚A) of the B and N atoms optimized with 6311G**/RI-J
basis set for the recently synthesized octahedral B24N24 cage are (0.66, 1.66,
2.59) and (2.74, 1.65, 0.74) respectively for the three-fold axis in the (1,1,1)
direction. The positions of all remaining of atoms in the cage can be generated
by symmetry operations. The HOMO and LUMO both have e symmetry and
yield a large gap of 4.94 eV that agrees with the value of 4.95 eV [1] obtained
using DV-Xα at the PM5 geometry.

The C4h B28N28 cage [Fig. 1(c)] is generated from the base B24N24 cage by
cutting the latter into two halves after orienting it along the C4 axis, then
inserting a ring of eight alternating B and N atoms perpendicular to the axis,

i.e. horizontally, and then rotating the top half by an eighth of a revolution.
The resultant cage structure has C4h symmetry with eight inequivalent atoms.
If another ring of four BN dimers is inserted in the same manner, then the
resultant B32N32 cage is a tubular structure with S8 symmetry [Fig. 1(d)].
Table I shows systematic increase in the binding energy by going from B24N24
to the B28N28 cage (0.26 eV per BN pair) and from B28N28 to B32N32 cage
(0.06 eV/BN pair). The successive additions of more BN rings will result in
further stabilization of the BN tubular cages and will ultimately lead to the
(4,4) BN nanotube. Thus our total energy calculations do not rule out the
possibility of BN tubes with round caps similar to those observed in case of

carbon nanotubes. A recent molecular dynamics study of the growth mecha-
nism of BN nanotubes has also noted the formation of a cap containing four
squares and octagon for this nanotube [28]. Molecular models of caps with
four squares, octagons and hexagons were also speculated earlier[30]. All the
BN cages studied have rather large HOMO-LUMO gaps of about 4.9-5.5 eV
similar to those observed for the inﬁnite BN nanotubes (∼ 5.5 eV)[29]. The
vertical ionization potential (VIP) calculated as the energy diﬀerence of the
two self-consistent calculations for the neutral and singly positively charged
cage also show relatively large values.

Fig. 2 shows two examples of the most favorable BN cages that are composed
of eight equivalent triangular faces meeting at six isolated squares [4,3]. Their
BE, HOMO-LUMO gap and VIP are given in Table 1. The smaller cage, T
B28N28 , Fig. 2(a) has the same stoichiometry as the middle-sized nanotube
of Fig. 1. That C4h B28N28 hemispherically-capped nanotube is related to
this cage by the insertion of twelve defects: six squares and six octagons.
Using the triple-ζ basis the energetic cost is 0.14 eV per defect and using the
double-ζ basis the cost is 0.12 eV per defect, which is more than an order of
magnitude less than the cost of any additional defect in a carbon fullerene.
The calculations indicate that these cages are energetically more stable than
the B24N24 cage. The trend is similar to that observed in case of C60 where
higher fullerenes have larger binding energy than the C60[13].

Fig. 4. (Color online) The possible round cap of the (8,8) nanotube based on the
B96N96 cage.

C60 does not cap the most important carbon nanotubes. Probably the metal-
lic (10,10) nanotube is most important [31]. It can be capped by halves of
round, but not perfectly round like C60, icosahedral C240 [32]. B24N24 can be
enlarged by adding hexagons. Another such round cage of octahedral sym-
metry is B96N96 . The two optimized round cages of this study are shown in
Fig. 3. The Table shows that B96N96 is the more stable than the B24N24 . Its
halves (Cf. Fig. 4) would cap a round (8,8) BN nanotube. It is clearly diﬀer-
ent, from B24N24 , in that while being mostly round, its twelve squares stick
out signiﬁcantly, like the detonators of a sea mine. Furthermore, B96N96 is
not substantially more stable than the other cages of Table I, despite the fact
that it is at least three times as large. Thus we think it unlikely that hemi-
spherical caps for larger than BN (4,4) nanotubes, if they exist at all, will
have isolated squares, but no really attractive possibilities come to mind. For
example, six square-octagon-square units could be placed on the two-fold axes

7

of the octahedral group, but the Euler overclosure would have to be balanced
by two extra octagons inserted elsewhere to form a hemisphere. Of course, BN
nanotubes could be capped by hemispheres of carbon fullerenes.

To summarize, all electron analytic density functional based calculations have
been performed on selected boron-nitride cage structures including the re-
cently synthesized B24N24 cage. The energetics of the BN tubular structures
with the end caps based on this cage points to possible existence of round
capped BN nanotubes. Amongst the BN cages that satisfy the six isolated
square rule the higher B28N28 and B32N32 cages are found to be energetically
more stable than the smallest B24N24 consistent with earlier calculations [4],
but apparently they are not more abundant experimentally [1]. Additional
topological defects in the most favorable BN cages seem more energetically fa-
vorable than defects in the fullerenes. Probably round caps on BN nanotubes
with circular cross section are more likely than ﬂat caps on triangular carbon
nanotubes.

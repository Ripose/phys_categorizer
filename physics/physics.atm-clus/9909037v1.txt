The thermodynamic stability of structural isomers of C24, C26, C28 and C32, including fullerenes, is studied using
density functional and quantum Monte Carlo methods. The energetic ordering of the diﬀerent isomers depends
sensitively on the treatment of electron correlation. Fixed-node diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations
predict that a C24 isomer is the smallest stable graphitic fragment and that the smallest stable fullerenes are the
C26 and C28 clusters with C2v and Td symmetry, respectively. These results support proposals that a C28 solid
could be synthesized by cluster deposition.

Since the discovery of the fullerene C60 [1], the study
of carbon clusters has revealed a rich variety of physical
and chemical properties. Fullerene clusters may now be
synthesised in macroscopic quantities, but despite many
experimental and theoretical advances the detailed en-
ergetics of these systems are not yet fully understood.
The question “which is the smallest stable fullerene?”
remains both interesting and contentious due to the sen-
sitivity of cluster formation to experimental conditions
and the challenges posed to theoretical methods by sys-
tem size and the high accuracy required. In this Letter
we report very accurate calculations of the relative ener-
gies of C24, C26, C28 and C32 clusters, and identify the
smallest stable fullerenes.

The number of low-energy candidate structures can be
large, even for quite small clusters, precluding exhaus-
tive theoretical searches with highly accurate but com-
putationally expensive methods.
In practice, a hierar-
chy of methods of increasing accuracy and computational
cost must be used. The ﬁrst step is to select candidate
structural isomers via empirical methods based on bond
counting and geometric “rules” such as “minimize the
number of adjacent pentagons” [2]. Quantum mechani-
cal calculations based on tight-binding and density func-
tional theory (DFT) methods can then used to reﬁne the
selection. To ﬁnally establish the energetic ordering of
diﬀerent isomers, highly accurate calculations must be
performed. Quantum chemical methods, such as coupled
cluster (CC) calculations [3], are potentially highly accu-
rate, but are severely limited by the size of basis set that
is computationally aﬀordable in these systems. Quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC) methods give an accurate treatment
of electron correlation which, combined with an absence
of basis set error, favorable scaling with system size and
suitability for parallel computation, renders them ideal
for these studies. QMC calculations have reproduced
experimental binding energies of small hydrocarbons to
within 1% [4]. Using the techniques described below we
have calculated the cohesive energy of bulk diamond, ob-
taining values of 7.36(1) and 7.46(1) eV per atom in vari-
ational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diﬀusion Monte Carlo

(DMC), respectively, which are in very good agreement
with the experimental value of 7.37 eV.

Carbon clusters are particularly challenging to model
accurately due to the wide range of geometries and the
occurrence of single, double, and triple bonds. These dif-
ferences result in a non-cancelation of errors in relative
energies, exaggerating any errors due to approximations
involved in electronic structure methods. Despite these
potential diﬃculties, carbon clusters have been exten-
sively studied using methods such as tight-binding, den-
sity functional, quantum chemical and QMC [4–8]. The
need for high accuracy calculations with a sophisticated
treatment of electron correlation has been clearly illus-
trated by several previous studies. Grossman et al. [4]
have performed diﬀusion Monte Carlo calculations for
C20 clusters, ﬁnding that the fullerene is not energetically
stable. A DFT study of C20 isomers showed that the local
density approximation (LDA) [9] and the BLYP gradient-
corrected functional [10] gave diﬀerent energy orderings
for the sheet, bowl and fullerene structures, with nei-
ther agreeing with that of DMC [4]. Jensen et al. [11]
made calculations for the monocyclic ring and fullerene
isomers of C24 which demonstrated signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between the predictions of the LDA, gradient corrected
and hybrid density functionals. These authors also per-
formed second-order Møller-Plesset and CC calculations,
but with a limited basis set, concluding that the fullerene
is lower in energy than the ring. Raghavachari et al. [12]
and Martin et al. [13] studied seven isomers of C24 using
DFT, but obtained conﬂicting energetic orderings.

For clusters containing between 20 and 32 atoms, three
classes of isomer are energetically competitive: fullerenes,
planar or near-planar sheets and bowls, and monocyclic
rings. The smallest possible fullerene, deﬁned as a closed
cage containing only pentagonal and hexagonal faces [14],
consists of 20 atoms. However, the smallest fullerenes
most commonly identiﬁed by time of ﬂight and mass
spectroscopy measurements are the C30 and C32 clus-
ters [15–17]. Rings are found to dominate up to ap-
proximately 28 carbon atoms under typical experimental
conditions, and fullerenes are mostly observed for larger

1

clusters, although other structures are also present (see
for example, Ref. [17]). In this work we present a QMC
study of ﬁve isomers of C24, three of C26 and C28, and
two of C32, thereby covering the range of masses from
where the fullerene is clearly predicted to be unstable to
where a fullerene is clearly observed. This enables us to
predict the smallest energetically stable fullerene.

We apply the diﬀusion quantum Monte Carlo method
[18,19] in which the imaginary time Schr¨odinger equation
is used to evolve an ensemble of electronic conﬁgurations
towards the ground state. The “ﬁxed node approxima-
tion” is central to this method; the nodal surface of the
exact fermionic wave function is approximated by that of
a guiding wave function. Core electrons were modeled by
an accurate norm-conserving pseudopotential [20], and
the non-local energy was evaluated stochastically within
the locality approximation [21]. We used Slater-Jastrow
guiding wave functions consisting of the product of a sum
of Slater determinants of single-particle orbitals obtained
from CRYSTAL95 [22] or Gaussian94 [23] with a Jastrow
correlation factor [24]. Optimized uncontracted valence
Gaussian basis sets of four s, four p and one d function
were used to represent the single-particle orbitals. Jas-
trow factors of up to 80 parameters were optimized using
eﬃcient variance minimization techniques [25,26], yield-
ing 75-90% of the DMC correlation energy.

We relaxed the structures by performing highly con-
verged density functional calculations. The geometries
were obtained from all-electron calculations [23] using the
B3LYP hybrid functional [27] and Dunning’s cc-pVDZ
basis set [28], which has been found to be an accurate and
aﬀordable combination [13,29,30]. To assess the sensitiv-
ity of the total energies to the geometries, we compared
the energies of the fully relaxed ring and D6 fullerene
isomers of C24 (see Fig. 1) using the BLYP and B3LYP
functionals. The functionals give signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
energetic orderings, but the diﬀerences between the ge-
ometries are small - less than 0.03 angstroms in bond
lengths and 0.4 degrees in bond angles. The relative en-
ergies of these structures changed by a maximum of 0.27
eV for each of the functionals investigated. The relative
energies are therefore rather insensitive to the functional
used to obtain the geometries, but are more sensitive
to the functional used to calculate the energies. These
changes are small compared with the overall range of en-
ergies, but some changes in the orderings of the isomers
closest in energy could occur.

We considered the following isomers of C24, as de-
picted in Fig. 1: a polyacetylenic monocyclic ring, a ﬂat
graphitic sheet, a bowl-shaped structure with one pen-
tagon, a caged structure with a mixture of square, pen-
tagonal and hexagonal faces, and a fullerene. Other can-
didate structures, such as bicyclic rings and a 3-pentagon
bowl were excluded on the grounds that DFT calculations
using several diﬀerent functionals have shown them to be
signiﬁcantly higher in energy [12,13]. As well as DMC

calculations we have also performed DFT calculations
using the LDA, two gradient corrected functionals (PBE
[31] and BLYP) and the B3LYP functional. The results
shown in Fig. 1 conﬁrm that the treatment of electron
correlation has a profound eﬀect on the relative energies.
All of the functionals give diﬀerent energetic orderings,
and none gives the same ordering as DMC. The graphitic
sheet is placed lowest in energy by DMC, in agreement
with each of the functionals except BLYP, which places
the ring lowest in energy. The low energy of the C24
graphitic sheet is expected because the structure accom-
modates a large number (7) of hexagonal rings without
signiﬁcant strain. This structure is predicted to be the
smallest stable graphitic fragment. Both DMC and the
DFT approaches ﬁnd the C24 fullerene to be unstable.

Three isomers of C26 were considered: a cumulenic
monocyclic ring, a graphitic sheet with one pentagon and
a fullerene of C2v symmetry (Fig. 2). Few studies of the
C26 fullerene have been made, in part due to the high
strains evident in its structure [14]. Recently Torelli and
Mit´aˇs have demonstrated the importance of using multi-
determinant trial wave functions to describe aromaticity
in 4N+2 carbon rings [32]. We have tested this for the
C26 ring, using a 43 determinant trial wave function ob-
tained from a CI singles-doubles calculation. The multi-
determinant wave function gave a slightly lower DMC
energy than the single determinant wave function, by
approximately 0.5 eV, conﬁrming that CI wave functions
can have better nodal surfaces than HF wave functions.
The ring and sheet-like isomers are close in energy, but
the fullerene is approximately 2.5 eV below these iso-
mers and is therefore predicted to be the smallest stable
fullerene. Small changes in the geometries are highly un-
likely to change this conclusion.

Three C28 isomers were investigated: a monocyclic
ring, a graphitic sheet and a fullerene of Td symmetry
(Fig. 3). Other bowl and sheet-like structures were ex-
cluded on energetic grounds [30]. Spin-polarized DFT
calculations show the ground state of the Td symmetry
fullerene to be a spin-polarized 5A2 state. DMC predicts
that this spin-polarized fullerene is the lowest energy iso-
mer of C28, and this is supported by each of the func-
tionals except BLYP. The spin-polarized fullerene has
four unpaired electrons and is therefore highly reactive.
This property has been exploited in atom trapping exper-
iments in which fullerenes containing single four-valent
atoms, C28M, have been prepared by laser vaporization
of a graphite-MO2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf or U) composite rod
[33]. Our prediction that the fullerene is the most stable
isomer of C28 indicates that isolated fullerenes might be
readily produced. This would facilitate investigations of
C28 fullerene solids, which have been discussed but not
yet produced [33,34], although this route may be ham-
pered by the chemical reactivity of the fullerene. (A C36
fullerene solid has been reported [35].)

Our DFT and DMC results for C28 (Fig. 3) again high-

2

light a wide variation between diﬀerent DFT functionals.
The LDA and B3LYP functionals predict the same or-
dering as DMC, but the PBE and BLYP functionals give
diﬀerent orderings. The DMC data strongly indicates
that the Td fullerene is the most stable C28 isomer at
zero temperature. The fullerene has the lowest DMC en-
ergy in both spin-polarized and non spin-polarized calcu-
lations, and is substantially more stable than the sheet
and ring. Small changes in the geometries are therefore
unlikely to change this ordering.

Our DMC calculations for the C32 monocyclic ring and
fullerene show that the fullerene is 8.4(4) eV per molecule
lower in energy, which is consistent with the observation
of a large abundance of C32 fullerenes in a recent clus-
ter experiment [15]. In Fig. 4 we plot the DMC binding
energies per atom of all the ring and fullerene structures
considered. The binding energies of the fullerenes rise
much more rapidly with cluster size than those of the
rings because of the large amount of strain in the smaller
fullerenes. The DMC binding energy of the C32 fullerene
is approximately 1 eV per atom less than the experimen-
tal binding energy of C60.

Our DFT and DMC results highlight several impor-
tant trends in the relative performance of the diﬀerent
functionals. The overall quality of a functional for the
clusters is best judged by the agreement with the DMC
data for the overall shapes of the relative energy data of
Figs. 1-3. The best agreement is given by the PBE and
B3LYP functionals, with the LDA being slightly inferior
and the BLYP functional being worst. The tendency of
the LDA to favor structures of high average coordination
and for the BLYP functional to favor structures of low
average coordination is consistent with the results for C20
reported by Grossman et al. [4].

The ﬁnal test of our predictions must lie with experi-
ment. It is clear that the actual abundances of diﬀerent
clusters depend sensitively on experimental conditions.
Analysis of the stability of clusters against fragmenta-
tion, growth and other chemical reactions is complicated.
One key issue is that the clusters are formed at tem-
peratures of order 1000K and therefore the vibrational
contributions to the free energy can be signiﬁcant. For-
tunately, a simple picture emerges from computations of
vibrational properties [12,13,30]. Fullerenes are relatively
rigid and have higher vibrational free energies than rings,
which have many low-lying vibrational modes. Vibra-
tional eﬀects therefore tend to favor the ring isomers at
high temperatures. However, according to our DMC cal-
culations the C26 and C28 fullerenes are several eV per
cluster lower in energy than the other isomers, so that
signiﬁcant amounts of fullerene could exist at the tem-
peratures of formation. If thermodynamic stability alone
were to determine which cluster sizes were observed then
only the largest fullerenes would ever be observed, but in
a recent experiment the abundance of the C32 fullerene
was found to be greater than C60 [15]. There is more evi-

dence that thermodynamic stability to rearrangements of
clusters of a particular size are important in determining
which isomers are observed. For example, in the experi-
mental study of Ref. [15], fullerenes were mostly observed
for clusters containing more than about 30 carbon atoms,
while for smaller clusters mostly rings were formed. This
crossover is close to the critical size for fullerene stability
of 26-28 atoms predicted by our DMC calculations.

In conclusion, performing accurate calculations of the
relative energies of carbon clusters is a severe test of elec-
tronic structure methods because of the widely diﬀering
geometries and the occurrence of single, double and triple
bonds. In our DMC calculations for C24, the lowest en-
ergy isomer is a graphitic sheet, which is expected to be
the smallest stable graphitic fragment. We predict that
the smallest energetically stable fullerenes are the C2v
symmetry C26 cluster and the spin polarized 5A2 state
of the Td symmetry C28 cluster. This prediction lends
weight to recent proposals that a C28 solid [33,34] could
be synthesized by surface deposition of C28 fullerenes.

An evidence of importance of the T-shaped conﬁguration of coronene dimer is

presented, Thus, the dimer’s lowest energy conﬁguration is not necessarily a stack,

as it might had been expected a priori. This is a surprising result for the dimer of

such a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) as coronene (C24H12) for which

a graphite-like stack . The energy of the T-shaped conﬁguration at all considered

levels of density functional theory (B3LYP,PBE/6-31+G(d),D95,cc-pVDZ,cc-pVTZ)

was systematically lower than the energy of the three plausible stack conﬁgurations.

In order to get a better description of the van der Waals interaction, the density func-

tional theory (DFT) results were adjusted by adding a phenomenological Lennard-

Jones-type term into the total energy of the system. However, the van der Waals

correction is somewhat arbitrary and its magnitude can not be rigorously justiﬁed.

Depending on the choice of the parameters in the phenomenological term both the

T-shaped and the parallel-displaced (PD) stack conﬁgurations can be the global

energy minimum of the system. A simple model is proposed which is useful for

qualitative understanding of possible geometries of the coronene dimer and larger

coronene clusters. The model represents coronene dimer as two sets of charged rings

interacting via Coulomb and Lennard-Jones potentials. The model provides an in-

tuitively clear explanation why the T-shaped dimers can be of importance even for

some of moderately large PAHs such as coronene and, may be, for circumcoronene.

The unexpectedly strong binding of the coronene dimer in the T-shaped conﬁgura-

tion is connected to the round shape of the coronene molecules. Indeed, rotation

or parallel-displacement of the non-round monomers results in signiﬁcantly smaller

Coulomb repulsion as compared to the ”face to face” sandwich conﬁguration. How-

ever, rotation and/or displacement are much less eﬀective for the stacked round

molecules. Therefore, the round shape of the coronenes leads to an increased role

2

of the electrostatic repulsion in the stack conﬁgurations and the T-shaped conﬁg-

uration can become competitive. The proposed model can be easily generalized to

other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, DNA bases, etc.

INTRODUCTION

Molecules of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their ions are of current interest as

they are believed to be one of the most probable species in the interstellar space responsible for

converting the UV radiation of stars into the intensive IR radiation, known as unidentiﬁed infrared

bands [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The physical mechanisms and eﬀectiveness of energy transfer from the

UV to the IR radiation occuring via transient heating [8] are currently being studied, see, e.g.,

Astrophysical observations suggest that the interstellar medium contains a variety of small

carbonaceous particles with the sizes ranging from dust grains down to single molecules [12].

The most abundant particles contain between 100 and 1000 carbon atoms [13] in the forms of

collections (clusters) of PAH-like molecules [10] of various degrees of hydrogenation [2]. Hence,

studying properties of PAH clusters presents a necessary step in further research of interstellar

[1, 9, 10, 11].

medium.

The current knowledge of structure and ways of formation of PAH clusters is very limited.

Laboratory studies have just started to appear and only anthracene [14, 15], naphthalene [14] and

coronene [16, 17] clusters have been produced so far, so that the array of available experimental

data is sparse. Theoretical investigations of oligomers of the larger PAHs are also scarce and,

furthermore, their results are very sensitive to a subtle interplay between the van der Waals polar-

ization forces (also sometimes called dispersive interaction) and the electrostatic interaction. Even

for benzene, the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon, an unequivocal choice between the T-shaped and

the parallel-displaced stack conﬁgurations can not be made since the calculated binding energies

for these conﬁgurations strongly depend on the choice of the method of calculation and on the basis

set and they do not seem to be converging even at the most advanced levels of theory [18, 19, 20].

Alternative approaches based on mixing of the ab initio and the phenomenological treatments have

been suggested which allow a more ﬂexible tuning of interactions (see, e.g., [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]),

but their universality and predictive power are not quite clear yet.

We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations of energies for four plausible

conﬁgurations [22] of the coronene dimer. These included three stack conﬁgurations (superimposed

stack - ”sandwich” (SS), twisted stack (TS) and parallel-displaced (PD) stack) and the T-shaped

conﬁguration. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comparative study of the conﬁgurations of the

coronine dimer within the ab initio approach. The only other ab initio calculation of coronene

dimer parameters was done for the PD stack conﬁguration [21].

The energy of the T-shaped conﬁguration at all considered levels of theory (combinations of the

B3LYP and PBE functionals with 6-31+G(d), D95, cc-pVDZ, and cc-pVTZ basis sets) was sys-

tematically lower than the energies of the stack conﬁgurations. In order to get a better description

of the van der Waals interaction, the DFT results were adjusted by adding a phenomenological

Lennard-Jones-type term into the total energy of the system. The problem of this approach is

that the van der Waals correction is somewhat arbitrary and diﬀerent authors choose diﬀerent

parameters even for the same systems (cf., e.g., [21] and [22]). Depending on magnitude of the van

der Waals term, both the T-shaped and the stack conﬁgurations can be the global minimum con-

ﬁguration of the system. Even though the deﬁnitive conclusion can not be drawn at the moment,

it is quite surprising on its own that the T-shaped conﬁguration is energetically competitive for

such a large system for which a graphite-like stacked structure was expected [21].

We propose a simple model useful for qualitative understanding of dimerization and cluster-

ization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The model represents a PAH molecule as a set of

circular or deformed rings corresponding to the chains of carbon atoms surrounded by a chain of

hydrogens. For example, the coronene molecule is represented as a set of four nested circular rings

with the outer ring corresponding to the hydrogens. The electron density in PAHs is shifted from

the hydrogens towards the interior of the molecules. In a crude approximation this charge distri-

bution can be described as a polarized band (with a positively charged outer edge and a negatively

4

charged inner edge) located along the perimeter of a molecule. This charge distribution can also

be considered as a dipole distributed along the border of a molecule. Two PAH molecules interact

electrostatically and via the van der Waals forces between the sets of the rings substituting the

monomers.

The model provides a qualitative explanation why even for such a large PAH as coronene

(C24H12) the T-shaped conﬁguration is comparable in energy with the stack conﬁguration. This

happens due to the round shape of the coronene molecule which leads to an increased electrostatic

repulsion in the stack conﬁgurations. For non-round molecules in the stack conﬁgurations, the

electrostatic interaction can be made less repulsive (or even attractive) by rotating or by parallel

displacing the molecules in the dimer, while for stacked round molecules the rotation or displace-

ment are much less eﬀective and the T-shaped conﬁguration can become competitive.

II. DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY TREATMENT OF CORONENE DIMER

We have performed density functional theory calculations of binding energies for four conﬁgu-

rations of coronene dimer. The binding energy of the coronene dimer is deﬁned as follows:

Eb = 2Emono

Edimer

−

(1)

where Edimer is the total energy of the coronene dimer and Emono is the energy of the single coronene

molecule. Note that according to this deﬁnition stable bound states of the coronene dimer posses

the positive value of energy.

The studied geometries are shown in Figure 1 and the binding energies are summarized in

Table I. The calculations have been done with the B3LYP and PBE functionals by expanding

the molecular orbitals into the standard 6-31+G(d), D95, cc-pVDZ, and cc-pVTZ basis sets as

implemented in Gaussian03 package [26, 27].

The energy of the T-shaped conﬁguration at all considered levels of theory was systematically

lower than the energies of the three stack conﬁgurations. It is a quite surprising result for such a

large PAH molecule. For the smallest aromatic hydrocarbon, benzene, the T-shaped conﬁguration

is almost isoenergetic with the parallel-displaced stack conﬁguration [18, 19, 20]. It is commonly

believed that increase in number of aromatic rings favors stack conﬁgurations over the T-shaped

ones [22, 24, 28]. In accordance with this assumption, the T-shaped (or, more generally, ”edge

to plane”) dimers of pyridine, naphtalene, and anthracene have been found less binding than the

stacked conﬁgurations [15, 24, 25]. In the only other ab initio calculation of a coronene dimer [21]

a graphite-like (parallel-displaced) stacked structure was considered only.

To our knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst comparative study of the possible conﬁgurations of the

coronine dimer performed within the ab initio approach. There were also studies of the coronene

dimer which used phenomenological approaches [22, 29, 30]. In the most recent study of this type

[22], the dimers and clusters of PAH molecules were modelled within a rigid-body approximation

with the use of explicit interatomic potentials (a sum of an electrostatic and a van der Waals

terms). None of these semiempirical studies found the T-shaped form of the coronene dimer to be

energetically preferable.

It is well known that the pure DFT methods does not reproduce the attractive polarization

interactions well enough, for a discussion see, e.g., Ref.

[21] and references therein. This may

present a serious problem in such intricate cases as determining the binding energy for loosely

bound dimers of PAH molecules. In order to estimate the inﬂuence of the polarization van der

Waals interaction on the preferred dimer geometry, we have included a phenomenological Lennard-

Jones-type term into the total energy of the system, similar to the procedure developed in [21]:

Unfortunately, there are no ﬁxed values for the coeﬃcients C6 and C12 which would be universally

parameters (cf., e.g., [21] and [22]). The arbitrariness of the van der Waals correction seems to be

a general problem of all such approaches.

conﬁgurations can be the global minimum conﬁguration of the system. Thus, we suppose that a

deﬁnitive conclusion can not be drawn at the moment. An experimental measurement of certain

characteristics (such as frequencies of transitions between rotational levels) would be useful for

determining the global energy minimum conﬁguration of the dimer. To facilitate identiﬁcation of

the dimer conﬁgurations, in Table III the rotational constants for each conﬁguration are given. The

rotation constants are deﬁned as follows Bj = ¯h/4πIjc, where Ij=xx,yy,zz are the principal values of

the moment inertia tensor.

III. RINGS MODEL OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS

The model approaches sometimes can be very useful in revealing the underlying physics of

a process and in pointing to the directions of search.

In some situations, when the ab initio

calculations are not feasible, the model calculations are the only approach one has to resort to. We

present here a model which elucidates the role of the shapes of PAH molecules in the process of

dimerization and in formation of bigger PAH clusters.

The model represents PAH molecules as a set of circular or deformed rings which correspond

to the chains of carbon atoms surrounded by a chain of hydrogens. For example, the coronene

molecule can be described as consisting of four concentric circular rings representing three chains

of carbon atoms and one chain of hydrogens, see Figure 2.

The electron density in PAHs is shifted from the hydrogens towards the interior of the molecules.

Therefore, the outer ring (corresponding to the hydrogens) is always charged positively. The inner

rings can, in principle, bear any charge, but their net charge, in the case of a neutral molecule,

must be negative and compensate the positive charge of the outermost ring.

The magnitude of charge for each ring is deﬁned on the basis of the results of the DFT cal-

culations as the sum of the partial charges of the atoms belonging to the corresponding chain.

Various methods can be used for assigning the partial charges to the atoms (Mulliken’s technique

9

FIG. 2: The round-shaped coronene molecule represented as a set of four nested rings. The radii of

the rings are 1.438, 2.876, 3.595, and 4.691 ˚A (RC−C=1.438˚A, RC−H=1.096˚A). The outermost ring

corresponds to hydrogens and is positively charged (Q=1.8 e). In the simplest case, this charge is

compensated by the negative charge of the next ring, corresponding to the chain of outer carbon

atoms. Two inner rings are neutral.

[33], Bader’s approach [34], natural bond orbitals (NBO) deﬁnition [35], etc.).

The Mulliken’s technique is based on the idea that the partial charge of an atom is calculated

from the electron density, which is integrated over a sphere of a given radius around the atomic

centre. The sphere radii are diﬀerent for each atom and were introduced by Mulliken [33].

In the NBO algorithm a set of atomic orbitals is transformed to a set of orthonormal hybrid

orbitals and to a set of bond orbitals in an optimal way. ”Optimal” in each case refers to a criterion

of maximum ocupancy, as determened by the one-particle density matrix. The partial charges are

determined from the topology associated with the density.

But in our work we mainly used another approach for the partial charge calculation, the so-

called Electrostatic potential scheme (ESP). In this method the partial charges of the atoms in the

system are determined from the best ﬁt of the actual electrostatic potential of the molecule [27].

This method is not only better justiﬁed physically for our purposes, but it also less dependent on

the choice of basis set used in calculation, see Table IV.

In the simplest approximation, the electron density, shifted from the hydrogens, is assigned

to the outer carbons, covalently bonded to the hydrogens. Then the ring corresponding to the

chain of the outermost carbons is charged negatively. The inner rings remain neutral. The charge

distribution in such approximation can be crudely described as a polarized band (with a positively

charged outer edge and negatively charged inner edge) located along the perimeter of the molecule.

This charge distribution can also be considered as a dipole continuously distributed along the outer

border of a molecule. In fact, within this approximation one can assign a typical value of the partial

charge (say, 0.15 [31]) to all the hydrogen atoms and then one immediately obtains the charges of

the two outer rings. The DFT analysis of the electron density in this case is not necessary. This

approximation provides a tool for studying interactions of large PAHs which cannot be treated

with ab initio methods.

The model predicts the T-shaped and PD conﬁgurations to be stable, in accordance with the

results of the DFT calculations. In addition to it, the model provides an intutively obvious ex-

planation why even for such a large PAH as coronene the T-shaped conﬁguration is comparable

in energy with the stack conﬁguration. This happens due to the round shape of the coronene

molecule, since only the ”edge to plane” conﬁgurations can be stable electrostatically. On the

other hand, the dispersive interaction favors superimposed stacks for which the ”contact area” is

largest. For the non-round molecules, e.g., anthracene, the interplay between these two factors

results in parallel-displaced or rotated conﬁgurations [24], because a parallel displacement or a

rotation can signiﬁcantly decrease the electrostatic repulsion while not seriosly aﬀecting the van

der Waals attraction. However, for the round molecules, such as coronene, the rotation or par-

allel displacement are much less eﬀective in decreasing the Coulomb repulsion and the T-shaped

conﬁguration can become competitive.

12

Therefore, we conclude that in the dimerization process (and in formation of larger clusters of

PAH molecules) the shapes of the molecules are very important. The proposed simple model can

be useful in qualitative analysis of the possible conﬁgurations and in making the results of such

analysis intuitively clear. The model can be applied to any polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and

it can be easily generalized on the DNA bases, etc. The model can also be used for predicting

structures of larger coronene clusters and clusters of other PAHs.

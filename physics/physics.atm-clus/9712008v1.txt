Charge transfer in collisions of Na+

n cluster ions with Cs
atoms is investigated theoretically in the microscopic frame-
work of non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics. The
competing reaction channels and related processes aﬀect-
ing the charge transfer (electronic excitations, fragmentation,
temperature) are described. Absolute charge transfer cross
n (2.7 keV) + Cs −→ Nan + Cs+ have been
sections for Na+
calculated in the size range 4 ≤ n ≤ 11 reproducing the size
dependence of the experimental cross sections. The energy
dependence of the cross section is predicted for n = 4, 7, 9.
An exotic charge transfer channel producing Cs− is found to
have a ﬁnite probability.

Charge transfer represents one of the fundamental
atomic interactions. In the last decades, large progress
has been made in the understanding of charge transfer
mainly for two borderline cases: the elementary ion–atom
reaction [1] and the complex ion–surface interaction [2].
In the recent past, however, there has been a ﬂurry of
activity to close the gap between the two ﬁelds by in-
vestigating the intermediate case of ion–cluster collisions
[3–18]. In general, the basic aspect of cluster collisions
consists in the simultaneous occurrence and mutual cou-
pling of electronic transitions (charge transfer, excitation,
ionization) and nuclear-core excitations (vibration, rota-
tion, fragmentation) in a system, where the number of
electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is large but ﬁ-
nite. In particular, collision induced dissociation (CID)
will compete with charge transfer (CT) in such collisions.
Already, in one of the ﬁrst experiments with mass-
selected cluster beams, CT and CID were investigated
for Na+
n + Cs [4] collisions. An im-
portant result of these novel experiments was the direct
determination of the CT cross section for the neutraliza-
tion of the parent cluster ion, i.e.
Na+

n + Cs [3,4] and K+

n + Cs −→ Nan + Cs+

(1)

by measuring the neutral products associated with the
process (1) but discriminating neutral products originat-
ing from CID. Further experimental studies of CT in col-
lisions of cluster cations with atoms [5–10], molecules [7]

and clusters [11,9] have been performed providing a con-
siderable amount of data. Multiple CT processes accom-
panied by fragmentation have been observed in collisions
of highly charged ions with fullerenes [12,13] and sodium
clusters [14].

This enormous experimental progress was accompa-
nied by the development of a number of theoretical
descriptions of CT reactions in cluster collisions.
In
Ref. [4], a two-state model of (near) resonant CT was
presented. Classical barrier models [15,16] have been ap-
plied to distant collisions of C60 with highly charged ions.
Semi-microscopic descriptions of CT, which are based on
the jellium approximation [17] or on phenomenological
single-particle potentials [18], have also been suggested.
However, the combined description of CT and fragmenta-
tion or, more generally, a simultaneous treatment of elec-
tronic and nuclear degrees of freedom in non-adiabatic
cluster collisions is still an unsolved problem.

Recently, a universal microscopic approach called non-
adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NA-QMD) has
been developed, which describes classical atomic motion
simultaneously and self-consistently with electronic tran-
sitions in atomic many-body systems [19].
In this pa-
per, we present a fully microscopic analysis of CT and
fragmentation in cluster collisions applying the NA-QMD
theory to Na+

n + Cs.

The NA-QMD approach has been derived [19] on the
basis of the time-dependent density functional theory
[20], whereby the Kohn–Sham formalism within the time-
dependent local density approximation is used. Resulting
from an LCAO ansatz for the Kohn–Sham orbitals a set
of coupled diﬀerential equations for the time-dependent
coeﬃcients is obtained to determine the time evolution
of the electronic density as the consequence of the classi-
cal atomic motion. Simultaneously, Newton’s equations
of motion with explicitly time-dependent forces have to
be solved reﬂecting the possible energy transfer between
the classical system of ionic cores and the quantum-
mechanical system of valence electrons. Details of the
procedure to calculate expectation values of observables
or probabilities for speciﬁc electronic transitions (deﬁned
by the time-dependent electronic density) as well as of the
diﬀerent fragmentation channels (obtained from classical

trajectories) will be given elsewhere [21].

To elucidate the diﬀerent physical processes determin-
ing the absolute cross section of the CT reaction (1),
we have performed a detailed study of the system Na+
4
+ Cs at a lab collision energy of Elab = 2.7 keV. The
cluster projectile is prepared initially in its electronic
and geometric ground state (rhombic, D2h). In Fig. 1,
the time evolution of the calculated mean charge lo-
cated at the Cs atom hqCsi(t) (obtained from a popu-
lation analysis) as well as of the kinetic-energy diﬀer-
ence ∆Ekin(t) = Ec.m. − Ekin(t), where Ec.m. and Ekin(t)
are the collision energy and the total kinetic energy, re-
spectively, both referred to the center-of-mass frame, are
presented for two collision events with the same impact
parameter (b = 9 a.u.) but diﬀerent initial orientations of
the cluster with respect to the beam axis (see inserts (a)
and (b) in Fig. 1). The quantity hqCsi(t) characterizes the
quantum dynamics of CT, whereas ∆Ekin(t) describes
the energy ﬂow in the classical (ionic) degrees of free-
dom. A strong dependence of both quantities on the ini-
tial orientation of the cluster is observed. In the example
(a), nearly compensating charge ﬂuctuations during the
interaction lead ﬁnally to hqCsi ≈ 0, and the event corre-
sponds to a nearly elastic scattering ∆Ekin ≈ 0. In con-
trast, the large CT in the case (b) hqCsi ≈ 0.75 is accom-
panied by a considerable energy loss of ∆Ekin ≈ 0.34 eV.
An endothermic character is typical for most collision
events with appreciable CT, even at larger impact pa-
rameters, where no vibrational excitation of the cluster
occurs. Comparing the ionization potentials of the Cs
atom (3.89 eV) and the Na4 cluster (4.24 eV [22]) and
assuming a CT that results in the electronic ground state
of Na4, one should expect an exothermic reaction with
∆Ekin ≈ −0.35 eV. That this is not the case indicates
that the CT process produces an electronically excited
Na4 cluster.

The calculation of CT cross sections requires a de-
tailed analysis of the ﬁnal electronic and atomic states
and, in particular, the careful consideration of CT prob-
abilities for diﬀerent reaction channels. To start with a
transparent classiﬁcation, we deﬁne integral CT proba-
bilities, which are the probabilities P (Csq) to ﬁnd the Cs
atom in the charge state q in the exit channel, where q
is an integer and Pq P (Csq) = 1. These probabilities
describe the primary CT (q 6= 0) and scattering (q = 0)
processes without regard to the further evolution of the
cluster, i.e. to the possible fragmentation. The related
CT cross sections can be directly measured by detect-
ing the formed Cs ions. The probabilities P (Csq), cal-
culated as an average of the results obtained with about
300 diﬀerent initial orientations of the cluster per im-
pact parameter b, are shown as a function of b in the
upper panel of Fig. 2. The CT leading to Cs+ ions and
the scattering without CT have nearly equal probabilities
P (Cs+) and P (Cs), respectively, for impact parameters
b ≤ 8 a.u.. As the graph of P (Cs+) indicates, CT takes

place with remarkable probability up to impact param-
eters of b ≈ 15 a.u., which is more than twice the long
half-axis (R = 5.7a.u.) of the Na4 rhombus. Surprisingly,
the calculations also yield a ﬁnite probability P (Cs
) for
an electron transfer to the Cs atom, which represents an
interesting prediction for future experimental studies.

The b-weighted integration of P (Cs+) leads to a to-
tal CT cross section of σ(Cs+) = (38.2 ± 2.1) ˚A
. For
comparison, the “geometrical” cross section of the clus-
ter is about σ0 ≈ π R2 ≈ 29 ˚A
and the measured value
2
is σexp(Na4) = (17 ± 3) ˚A
It is important to re-
alize, however, that, instead of Cs+, the signal of the
neutralized Na4 was detected in the measurements [3].
The “survival” probability of the Na4 cluster after the
primary CT is given by P (Cs+) · [1 − PFr], where PFr is
the total fragmentation probability. In cluster collisions,
fragmentation can be induced through three mechanisms
characterized by diﬀerent time scales [21,23,24]. These
are large momentum transfer between atoms of the pro-
jectile and of the target, electronic excitation followed

by energy transfer via electron-vibrational coupling, and
statistical fragmentation. Whereas the ﬁrst two mech-
anisms are precisely described by the NA-QMD theory
and automatically accounted for in the actual calcula-
tions (this has been shown in comparisons with experi-
mental data on CID [24]), the total probabilities of the
diﬀerent fragmentation channels can be determined from
the calculated internal (vibrational and electronic) exci-
tation energy of the cluster using statistical arguments
[21]. The calculated total fragmentation probability PFr
and the probability P (Na4) to have a neutral Na4 cluster
in the exit channel are shown as a function of b in the
lower panel of Fig. 2.

The calculations presented so far have been carried out
with zero initial temperature of the cluster, whereas un-
der the experimental conditions [3,4] “liquid” cluster ions
are used resulting from the laser ionization to produce
the cluster beam [25]. To take into account the temper-
ature eﬀect, we have repeated the procedure described
above with excited clusters in the initial state, where the
total excitation energy was chosen to be slightly below
the dissociation energies of the neutral as well as of the
cationic cluster. The initial conﬁgurations of the excited
clusters for the simulation of the collisions were produced
in equilibration runs of 300 ps in length. The calculated
2
CT cross section σ(Na4) = 16.8˚A
obtained with “liquid”
cluster ions is in perfect agreement with the experimental
result.

The theoretical and experimental [3] CT cross sections
are compared as a function of the cluster size n in Fig. 3.
The theoretical results were obtained with “liquid” clus-
ter ions in the initial state. Except for the case of n = 5,
the agreement of the computed and measured data can
be qualiﬁed as perfect, since these data are absolute cross
sections. The statistical uncertainties of the calculated
cross sections reﬂect the strong dependence of the out-
come of the collision process on the initial conﬁguration.
These uncertainties could be reduced further only at a
very high computational cost [21]. The overestimated
cross section in the case n = 5 results from contributions
of a particular isomer, for which accidentally a (quasi-)
resonant CT with Cs occurs [21].

n + Cs collisions [4] a very strong dependence of the
CT cross section on the collision energy has been found
(cf. Fig. 4 in Ref. [4]). In order to examine this aspect
and to stimulate further experimental investigations, we
have calculated the CT cross section over a wide range
of the (center-of-mass) collision energy (0.1 . . . 30 keV)
for n = 4, 7, 9. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The
absolute CT cross section for n = 7 exceeds those for
n = 4 and n = 9 over the entire energy range considered.
Consequently, the large CT cross section in Na+
7 + Cs
collisions should be attributed to the speciﬁc electronic
structure of Na+
7 providing favorable, i.e. near resonant
conditions for CT in collisions with Cs.

In summary, we have presented results of a fully micro-
scopic analysis of CT and fragmentation in cluster-ion –
atom collisions based on NA-QMD simulations. The de-
tailed study of Na+
4 (2.7 keV) + Cs collisions revealed the
role of the diﬀerent physical processes associated with
CT in cluster collisions (electronic excitations, fragmen-
tation, temperature eﬀects). An exotic “inverse” CT pro-
cess leading to Cs− is predicted. The calculated absolute
CT cross sections for Na+
n (2.7 keV) + Cs (4 ≤ n ≤ 11)
are in good agreement with the experimental data. The
energy dependence of the CT cross section is predicted
for several cluster sizes (n = 4, 7, 9) in order to encourage
further experimental studies.

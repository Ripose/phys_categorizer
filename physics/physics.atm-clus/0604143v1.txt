Abstract. The dynamics of vibrational wave packets excited in K2 dimers attached
to superﬂuid helium nanodroplets is investigated by means of femtosecond pump-probe
spectroscopy. The employed resonant three-photon-ionization scheme is studied in a
wide wavelength range and diﬀerent pathways leading to K+
2 -formation are identiﬁed.
While the wave packet dynamics of the electronic ground state is not inﬂuenced by the
helium environment, perturbations of the electronically excited states are observed.
The latter reveal a strong time dependence on the timescale 3 − 8 ps which directly
reﬂects the dynamics of desorption of K2 oﬀ the helium droplets.

Wave packet dynamics of K2 attached to helium nanodroplets

1. Introduction

The advent of femtosecond (fs) spectroscopy has allowed the visualization of the nuclear
motion in molecular systems in “real-time”, delivering new insight into the nature of
the chemical bond and of the dynamics of chemical reactions [1, 2, 3, 4]. In femtosecond
pump-probe experiments this visualization relies on the creation and interrogation of
vibrational wave packets, i. e. coherent superpositions of vibrational states excited by
the fs laser pulse. Fs pump-probe spectroscopy has become a widely-spread method
providing complementary information to spectroscopy in the frequency domain because
fast dynamical processes are often directly accessible.

Besides fs studies of molecules prepared in the gas phase, the real-time spectroscopy
of molecules isolated in inert noble-gas matrices is an active ﬁeld of research. On the
one hand, matrix isolated molecules display a large variety of manybody phenomena
such as solvational shifts of electronic states, electron phonon coupling, matrix induced
electronic and vibrational relaxation and decoherence, reduced dissociation probability
(“caging eﬀect”), excimer and exciplex formation, charge recombination [5]. On the
other hand, these conceptually simple model systems can still be handled theoretically.
The ﬁeld was pioneered by Zewail and co-workers using I2 as a molecular probe and
varying the structural properties of the solvent environment from gas [6], over clusters [7]
and liquid [8] to solid [7]. For example, in experiments with I2 in Ar clusters Liu and
coworkers found that the coherent wave packet motion can survive the dissociation and
matrix-induced recombination process [7]. Schwentner and cowokers have extended real-
time studies to halogen molecules (I2, Cl2, Br2, ClF) in rare gas matrices, adding several
new aspects in this kind of studies [9, 10, 11, 12]. Besides, Hg2 has been investigated in a
cryogenic Ar matrix [13]. Conservation of vibrational coherence during a few picoseconds
despite matrix induced electronic relaxation was observed. Due to the diﬃculty of
implanting impurities into liquid helium, no real-time measurements with molecules in
bulk liquid or solid helium have been reported until now. However, femtosecond laser-
induced ionization of liquid helium and the subsequent preparation of He∗
2 excimers in
superﬂuid He has been reported [14]. Recently, electronic coherence relaxation of I2 in
helium and other gases has been measured by fs photon echo [15].

Among the ﬁrst molecules to be studied by fs spectroscopy in the gas-phase were
alkali dimers [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. Cold alkali dimers are easily prepared in a
molecular beam and strong electronic transitions are well accessible by common fs laser
sources. The potassium dimer K2 has been studied in detail in a series of one and two-
color experiments demonstrating the propagation of vibrational wave packets in the
ground state and in diﬀerent excited states [19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]. By varying the
excitation laser wavelength and intensity, diﬀerent pathways leading to ionization were
identiﬁed. In addition, more subtle eﬀects were studied such as the eﬀect of spin-orbit
coupling on the nuclear dynamics in the isotopomer 39,39K2 which is absent in 39,41K2 [23].
Visualizing the time evolution of vibrational frequencies using spectrograms was found
to be useful for identifying transient phenomena such as fractional revivals in one-color

Wave packet dynamics of K2 attached to helium nanodroplets

pump-probe scans which are absent in the case of two-color two-photon ionization [24].
In this work we present the ﬁrst fs experiments probing wave packet propagation
of molecules attached to superﬂuid helium nanodroplets. Today, helium nanodroplets
are widely applied as a nearly ideal cryogenic matrix for spectroscopy of embedded
molecules and as nanoscopic reactors for building speciﬁc molecular complexes [28, 29].
Alkali atoms and molecules represent a particular class of dopant particles due to
their extremely weak binding to helium droplets with binding energies on the order
of 10 K (7 cm−1). From both theory and experiment it is known that alkali dimers
reside in bubble-like structures on the surface of helium droplets [30, 31, 32]. Therefore,
spectroscopic shifts of the electronic excitation spectra of alkali dimers are in the range
of only a few cm−1 with respect to the gas phase [33, 32, 34, 35, 36]. Upon electronic
excitation, alkali atoms and molecules mostly desorb from the droplets as a consequence
of evaporation of helium atoms after energy deposition in the helium droplet [37, 38, 39].
The time scale for the desorption process is largely unknown. Solely in an early time-
resolved study the desorption time of an alkali-helium excimer formed upon electronic
excitation is estimated to be much shorter than the ﬂuorescence lifetime [40].

Recently, the dynamics of photodissociation of molecules inside helium droplets has
been studied both theoretically and experimentally. In Ref. [41], photodissociation of
Cl2 embedded in helium clusters is studied by numerical simulation revealing reduced
caging eﬀects due to quantum properties of helium. The translational dynamics of
CF3 in liquid helium was investigated experimentally by photodissociation of CF3I
dissolved in helium droplets [42]. Using ion imaging techniques, the velocity distribution
of the fragments escaping from the droplets was found to be considerably shifted to
lower speeds. This behavior was successfully modeled assuming binary collisions with
helium atoms. The photoionization dynamics of aniline doped helium droplets was
investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy [43].
In these experiments, droplet-size
dependent lowering of the ionization threshold upon solvation was found.

Due to their weak coupling to the surrounding helium environment alkali dimers
on helium droplets can be viewed as an intermediate system between free molecules and
molecules isolated in conventional cryogenic matrices. The wave packet propagation is
expected to be only weakly perturbed and new dynamical phenomena resulting from
the desorption of the dimers upon fs excitation are observable. The highly quantum
nature of superﬂuid 4He droplets vs. normal ﬂuid 3He droplets may aﬀect the coupling
of the wave packet motion to the droplet [44, 45]. Moreover, exotic high-spin molecules
and complexes formed on He droplets can be studied in real time [34, 46, 47]. The wave
packet dynamics of Na2 in the lowest triplet state b3Σ+
u will be presented in a separate
paper.

femtosecond laser pulses and a mass selective detection unit. The beam line consists of
three diﬀerentially pumped vacuum chambers. In the ﬁrst chamber the helium droplet
beam is produced by condensation of helium gas (purity 99.9999%) in a supersonic
expansion from a cold nozzle with a diameter d = 10 µm into vacuum. At a nozzle
temperature T ≈ 19 K and a stagnation pressure p ≈ 50 bar the droplets contain about
5000 atoms. By varying the temperature of the nozzle the average size of the droplets
can be changed. To maintain a background pressure of ≈ 10−3 mbar we use a 8000 l/s
oil diﬀusion pump backed up by a roots and rotary vane pump.

The beam enters the second chamber through a skimmer with an aperture of 400 µm
diameter. There the droplets pass a heated cell where they successively pick up two
potassium atoms. Due to their high mobility on the superﬂuid helium droplets the
picked-up atoms bind together to form dimers which are weakly bound in a dimple
on the surface of the the helium nanodroplets. Collisional as well as binding energy
is dissipated by the helium droplet through evaporation of helium atoms, which may
cause the desorption of the alkali dimers from the droplets. Since the amount of internal
energy released upon formation of ground state (X 1Σ+
g ) dimers greatly exceeds the
one released upon formation of dimers in the lowest triplet state a3Σ+
u , the later has
a higher chance to remain attached to the droplet. This leads to an enrichment of
the droplet beam with high-spin dimers and clusters compared to covalently bound
systems [34, 47]. Nevertheless singlet ground state alkali dimers on helium droplets
have been studied [32, 36]. The alkali-helium droplet complex eventually equilibrates
at the terminal temperature of pure helium droplets of 380 mK. Thus, only the lowest

vibrational state v′′ = 0 and a few rotational states are populated which provides well-
deﬁned starting conditions for a pump-probe experiment. The number of collisions
of the droplets with free dopant atoms inside the vapor cell is controlled by the oven
temperature. Given the ﬂight distance of the droplets of 1 cm inside the vapor cell the
potassium reservoir is heated to a temperature T ≈ 410 K to achieve highest probability
for pick-up of two dopant atoms per droplet.

In the third vacuum chamber the doped droplet beam is intersected by the laser
beam at right angle. The femtosecond laser pulses are generated by an Ar+-laser
pumped Ti:Sapphire laser (Tsunami, Spectra-Physics) at 80 MHz repetition rate and
at an average power output between 1.2 and 1.4 W depending on the wavelength. This
corresponds to a pulse energy of about 16 nJ. The pulses have a duration of ≈ 110 fs
and a spectral bandwidth of ≈ 135 cm−1 (FWHM).

The laser beam is sent through a Mach-Zehnder interferometer to split the pulses
into two time delayed pump and probe parts with equal intensity. The time delay
is controlled by a commercial translation stage (PI M531DG) having 0.225 fs as the
smallest time increment. The collinear pulse pairs are then focused into the doped
helium droplet beam using a lens of 150 mm focal length. The interaction volume
is located inside the formation volume of a quadrupole mass spectrometer to mass
selectively detect the photoions. We estimate the intensity of the laser light at the
crossing point to be ≈ 0.5 GW/cm2 which corresponds to moderate intensity also used
in the experiments reported in Refs. [19, 27]. The time sequence of the experiment is
illustrated schematically in Fig. 2.

3. Pump-probe-spectroscopy of K2

The one-color pump-probe experiments reported in this work are carried out in the
wavelength region λ = 780 − 850 nm. The excitation scheme leading to wave packet
motion and subsequent ionization is illustrated in Fig. 3 using the gas-phase potentials
from Refs. [48, 49]. The relevant potential energy curves are the ground state X 1Σ+

g , v′′ = 0, absorption
K2 at λ = 833 nm. Starting from the vibrational ground state X 1Σ+
of one photon from the pump pulse creates a coherent superposition of ca. 5 vibrational
states around v′ = 12 in the A-state at the classical inner turning point. The vibrational
wave packet then propagates outwards and is transferred to the ionic state in a two-
photon step via the intermediate resonant state 2Π according to the resonance condition
that photon energy equals the diﬀerence in potential energies of A and 2Π states. It is
essential to note that the 2Π-state opens a Franck-Condon (FC) window for resonance
enhanced ionization around a well-deﬁned internuclear distance and therefore ﬁlters out
the wave packet dynamics in the A-state [19]. Thus, the measured photoionization yield
shows an oscillatory structure corresponding to the vibrational motion of the molecules
(cf. Figs. 5, 6). This oscillation has a well-deﬁned phase Φ at zero delay times. At 833 nm
the resonance condition is fulﬁlled at the outer turning point of the A-state. Thus, the
time between wave packet creation and ionization roughly equals half a period of the
wave packet oscillation and the detected signal has a phase ΦA

833 ≈ π.

The described scheme at 833 nm is particularly favorable for several reasons. First,
signiﬁcant population of the 21Π-state during the pump-pulse is suppressed because the
2Π ← A transition is stronger than the A ← X transition [19]. This leads to pure (1+2)-
photon excitation without contributions of (2+1)-photon transitions. Second, the outer

turning points on the potential curves of the A and the X-state coincide. Therefore the
FC factors for the A ← X transition is optimal at this wavelength [24]. Moreover, since
the dynamics in the A-state is sampled at the turning point the detected oscillation
directly reﬂects the nuclear dynamics [27].

Besides the described ionization scheme (type I) in the K2 experiments, the

following alternative pathways are depicted in Fig. 4:

• Type II: Wave packet excitation in the A-state. The transition to the ionic state
780 ≈ 2π. This

takes place at the inner turning point, which results in a phase ΦA
scheme applies to the excitation at λ ∼ 780 nm.

• Type III: Wave packet excitation in the 2Π-state by absorption of two photons from
the pump pulse. Ionization occurs by one-photon step during the probe pulse. This
schemes is active at λ ∼ 780 − 800 nm.

• Type IV: Wave packet excitation in the X-ground state by resonant impulsive
stimulated Raman scattering (RISRS) during the pump pulse [20]. Transition to
the ionic state is achieved by absorption of three photons from the probe pulse.
This scheme applies to the excitation at λ ≈ 780 − 820 nm.

Around 850 nm, the excitation proceeds similarly to the type III scheme but
involving the doubly excited state 41Σ+
instead of the 2Π-state. Which one of the
g
mentioned schemes is active, depends on the laser wavelength, intensity and polarization.
For example in the one-color pump-probe experiments with K2 in a molecular beam
reported by Nicole et al. [27], it was shown that type I is the dominant process in

the wavelength range λ = 837 − 816 nm, whereas at λ = 800 − 779 nm type III also
contributes. At λ = 779 nm the observed transient was best reproduced by a sum
of processes of type II and III. By increasing the laser intensity up to 5 GW/cm2, it
was shown that RISRS (type IV) signiﬁcantly contributes, which gives a parameter to
control the speciﬁc ionization pathway [20]. A diﬀerent method for generating a wave
packet in the ground state was studied using a two-color pump-dump-probe scheme
involving the B-state [26]. In that work, the population of the ground state wave packet
was controlled by varying the pump-dump delay and to a limited extent by varying
the pump and dump laser wavelengths. Recently, Brixner et al. have shown that laser
polarization opens an additional level of quantum control over the ionization mechanism.
By altering the mutual polarization of pump and probe pulses using an optimal control
scheme they were able to selectively enhance type I or type III transitions.

A typical real-time pump-probe spectrum of K2 attached to helium nanodroplets
recorded at the mass of the 39,39K+
2 dimer at λ = 820 nm is exempliﬁed in Fig. 5.
The signal is nearly symmetric with respect to the delay time zero which results from
the almost identical pump and probe pulses interchanging their roles at time zero.
Within the delay time window ±0.5 ps the ion signal displays fast oscillations due to
the autocorrelation of pump and probe pulse. This time interval is masked out in the
further data analysis. For longer delay times, the ion signal features an oscillation
on the ps time scale reﬂecting the wave packet dynamics. This oscillation is biased
by a large background ion count rate which reduces the contrast to about 10 %. The

background ion rate results from 3-photon ionization (3PI) of K2 during the pump or
the probe pulse. A second background contribution comes from K2 dimers interacting
with more than one pump-probe pulse pair as they ﬂy through the laser focus. Due to
the short period between two consecutive pump-probe pulse pairs of 12.5 ns (1/80 MHz)
and the comparable ∼ 10 ns lifetime of the excited states, the illuminated K2 beam
always contains a portion of already excited dimers.

In addition to the constant background another prominent feature shown in Fig. 5
is the increase of the ion signal during the ﬁrst 3 ps. This is due to potassium clusters
KN >2 formed on the helium droplets being photoionized and partially fragmenting into
K+
2 fragment ions. Thus the fragmentation dynamics of alkali clusters is also accessible
in our experiments but will be discussed in a separate paper. In order to prepare the
data for Fourier transformation (FT) a band-pass ﬁlter is applied which suppresses the
constant oﬀset and slow variations as well as high frequency noise.

The processed experimental transient ion signals are summarized in Fig. 6 for short
delay times 0 − 4 ps. As expected from the gas-phase, the most prominent oscillation
occurs at λ = 833 nm. Clearly, the oscillation amplitude is damped within the shown
time interval. As the wavelength decreases the amplitudes quickly drop and a new
higher frequency component appears which is most apparent at λ = 810 nm. For even

smaller wavelengths, the transients feature a more complicated structure, indicating
that more than one frequency component contributes. At λ = 850 nm, the ionization
trace is modulated by a slow oscillation with a rather weak amplitude. This oscillation
has the opposite phase as the one observed at λ = 833 nm.

In order to obtain more quantitative information about the exact frequencies and
relative amplitudes of the contributing frequency components the pump-probe traces
are Fourier transformed in the entire recorded delay time interval and plotted in Fig. 7.
For the sake of clarity, the spectra are individually normalized to their maxima. One
clearly distinguishes two characteristic frequencies which appear in all spectra. The
frequency ωX = 92.1(7) cm−1 matches the gas-phase vibrational constant ωe = 92.4 cm−1
of the ground state X 1Σ−
g [48]. Thus, a wave packet composed of the vibrational states
v′′ = 0, 1 is excited by RISRS (type IV transition). This type of ionization process
was observed in Refs. [19, 20] in one-color experiments.
In a two-color pump-dump-
probe experiment wave packets around v′′ = 1, 2 were excited leading to a level spacing
ωX(1, 2) = 91.5 cm−1 [26]. As expected for RISRS, ωX does not display any change with

varying laser wavelength. Moreover, no signiﬁcant frequency shift due to the interaction
with the helium droplet is observed. This result is not surprising when comparing to
vibrational spectroscopy of molecules inside the droplets. Vibrational shifts typically lie
in the range 0.1 − 2 cm−1 [28]. Since alkali dimers reside on the surface, even smaller
shifts are expected.

The frequency component in the range 64-66 cm−1 belongs to the vibration in
the A-state. It clearly shifts to higher values with increasing laser wavelength. This
results from the anharmonicity of the A-state potential: As the excitation wavelength
decreases higher vibrational levels, having a narrower energy spacing, are populated.
The frequencies ωA obtained from FT of the ﬁrst 7 ps are plotted in Fig. 8 (a). These
frequencies are average values of level spacings of about 5 vibrational levels which lie
inside the spectral proﬁle of the fs laser. In order to compare this result to unperturbed
K2 dimers, the corresponding average level spacings are calculated from experimental
data from Ref. [49] which are plotted as full circles in Fig. 8 (a). For example the value
close to λ = 810 nm (12350 cm−1) is calculated as the average of two level spacings,
(G(v′+1)−G(v′−1))/2, for v′ = 18. Here, G(v′) stands for the vibrational energy of level
v′. Without quantitatively analyzing the populations and the helium-induced shifts of

the v′-levels, Fig. 8 (a) indicates a clear trend: In the wavelength range λ = 840−780 nm
the vibrational level spacings of K2 on helium droplets vary more slowly than the ones
of free K2. Thus, the helium droplet environment inﬂuences the shape of the potential
curve of the A-state of K2 such that anharmonicity is reduced. Note that the frequencies
obtained from FT of our data in the time interval 10 − 20 ps, i. e. when desorption is
complete, agree with the calculated values within the error bars.

The amplitudes of the frequency components of X and A-states obtained from
FT of the ﬁrst 7 ps delay time are shown in Fig. 8 (b). The maxima are located
around 12350 cm−1 (810 nm) and 12000 cm−1 (833 nm), respectively. Surprisingly, in the
range 800-815 nm, the X-component dominates over the A-component, which strongly
diﬀers from the gas-phase observations at moderate laser intensities [19, 27]. According
to [19, 27], wave packets in the X-state are not detected at moderate laser intensities
due to the mismatch of the FC window for ionization determined by the 2Π-state and
the X-state wave packet.
In the case of K2 on helium droplets, a well localized FC
window appears in 3PI from the X-state. Because of the Pauli repulsion of the helium
environment towards the alkali valence electrons and the induced change in the spacial
valence electronic distribution upon electronic excitation, in particular the higher excited
states are expected to evolve larger energy shifts. The results demonstrate that the
helium-induced shifts of the potential energy curves signiﬁcantly alter FC overlaps. In
the following, several characteristic wavelengths are discussed in more detail.

thick line. The exponential drop by about one order of magnitude has a time constant
τ = 3.2(2) ps and the constant oﬀset amounts to merely 5 % of the initial amplitude.
This initial amplitude decrease is not observed in gas-phase measurements [23, 27].
Generally, this dynamics can originate from two diﬀerent mechanisms connected to
the inﬂuence of the helium matrix. First, matrix-induced eﬀects such as vibrational
relaxation may lead to decoherence of the wave packet [50]. In this case, the K2 dimers
are stuck to the helium surface and the coherent oscillation is damped and eventually
completely vanishes. However, this is not the case in our experiment. Second, additional
dynamics is introduced by the eﬀect of desorption of K2 from the helium surface, leading
to a transient perturbation of the wave packet motion. Finally, both of the mentioned
eﬀects may contribute to the observed dynamics. As discussed in more detail in the
last section, we interpret the observed exponential drop as the eﬀect of desorption of K2
from the helium nanodroplets. The distortion of the potential curves resulting from the
interaction with the helium leads to an enhancement of resonant 3PI which vanishes as
K2 moves away from the helium surface.

The FT spectrum at 833 nm shown in Fig. 7 clearly indicates that only one
frequency component contributes to the wave packet dynamics. The oscillation period
and phase during the initial exponential decay are found to be T 833nm
= 507 fs
(ωA1 =65.8 cm−1) and the phase equals half the oscillation period (Φ833nm
= 0.99 π,
ˆ=255 fs). This conﬁrms that at this wavelength K2 is ionized following the pathway
of type I as in the gas-phase. At delay times exceeding the desorption time the

oscillation period is reduced to T 833nm
agreement with the gas phase measurements of Ref. [49]. In gas-phase measurements
with 39,39K2 recording much longer scans, Rutz et al. were able to resolve by FT each
frequency spacing between the vibrational levels contributing to the wave packet. At
833.7 nm it was found that the FT spectrum is dominated by two frequency components
G(v′) − G(v′ − 1) and G(v′ + 1) − G(v′) for v′ = 13 due to spin-orbit coupling between
the A-state and the b3Πu-state [23]. The center of gravity of the lines lies at about
66 cm−1 which is again in good agreement with our ﬁndings. This suggests that in
our experiment a wave packet consisting of about 5 vibrational components around the
v′ = 13 vibrational state is excited.

The remaining oscillation after the initial damping features a slow periodic
modulation with a period of about 26 ps. The gas phase measurement with the
isotopomer 39,39K2 also shows a pronounced beat structure with a period of about 10 ps,
induced by the two dominating components mentioned above. In the isotopomer 39,41K2
spin-orbit coupling is not active in this region of the A-state potential [23]. In that case,
the beat structure is less pronounced and more complicated with longer periods > 50 ps,
resembling more the one that we measure with 39,39K2 on helium droplets. The fact that
the beating pattern after desorption does not precisely match the observed beating in the

gas-phase measurements is not totally understood. Presumably, we account diﬀerences
in the used pulse widths and shapes as well as diﬀerences in the wave packet formed
under perturbed conditions for this discrepancy.

The evolution of ωA can be followed in real-time by Fourier transforming the data
inside of a 3 ps time window which slides across the entire data set [24]. The resulting
spectrogram is depicted in Fig. 10 as a contour plot with logarithmic scale. Naturally, the
frequency resolution is reduced so that ω833nm
(tdelay) appears as a rather broad vertical
band. The color scale goes from blue for low to red for high amplitudes of the Fourier
≈ 66 cm−1
components. Thus, the initial drop of the oscillation amplitude at ω833nm
is visualized as intense red color which fades out at tdelay ≈ 10 ps and reappears at
around tdelay ≈ 20 ps indicating the revival mentioned above. The time evolution of
obtained by averaging within a frequency interval 55-80 cm−1 is
the amplitude of ω833nm
plotted in Fig. 11 (a). Obviously, the data reproduce the decreasing oscillation amplitude
at 833 nm as reﬂected by the ﬁt curve from Fig. 9 (solid line).

The shifting of the frequency ω833nm

is clearly visible in Fig. 10 as a deviation of
the green band from a vertical line. In particular, during the ﬁrst 10 ps in which the
oscillation amplitude decreases exponentially, ω833nm
shifts roughly linearly to higher
frequencies from 65.8 cm−1 to 66.3 cm−1, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 10 using a
diﬀerent color scaling. This frequency shift is attributed to the eﬀect of deminishing
perturbation of K2 by the helium droplet as it desorbes oﬀ the droplet. Presumably, the
perturbation of the A-state potential by helium vanishes as K2 desorbs from the helium
surface thereby shifting the vibrational frequencies back to their gas-phase values.

one at 833 nm in the way that it features a pronounced oscillation which is damped

during the ﬁrst 8 ps. The period T 820nm
Φ820nm
= 0.96 π (250 fs) again indicate wave packet propagation in the A-state (type I
A
scheme). This result is somewhat surprising since the corresponding gas-phase signals
are quite diﬀerent [27]. In the gas phase, the maxima of the oscillation are split into two
peaks of diﬀerent amplitudes, which is well described by the wave packet moving twice
through the FC window in each round trip. This is due to the fact that at 820 nm the
outer turning point of the 2Π-state (deﬁning the FC window) no longer coincides with
the one in the A-state but is shifted to smaller internuclear distance. This seems not
to be the case when K2 is attached to helium droplets. This can be explained by either
the shape of the A-state or of the 2Π-state being inﬂuenced by the helium such that the
FC overlap localized at the outer turning points is maintained down to a wavelength
λ = 816 nm. Since the vibrational frequencies in the A-state are only weakly perturbed
(Fig. 8 (a)), most likely the 2Π-state is bent up to higher energies in the outer region
of the potential well similarly to the caging-eﬀect of rare-gas matrices on the potential
curves of I2 [9]. Thus the the FC-window is shifted to shorter internuclear distances.

found to be Φ810nm
= 1.3 π (245 fs). Thus, we identify a type IV ionization sequence
in this wavelength region. This ﬁnding quite signiﬁcantly diﬀers from the gas-phase
results. According to [19, 27] no wave packet dynamics in the X-state is observed.
Instead, wave packet excitation in the 2Π-state contributes to an increasing extent at
shorter wavelengths. In the gas-phase, Fourier analysis of the transients at 834 nm does
reveal a frequency component corresponding to wave packet motion in the X-state.
However the amplitude is negligible with respect to the A-state contribution [19, 23]. A
dominating RISRS excitation was only observed at laser intensities exceeding the ones
in our experiment by more than a factor 10 [20]. This again demonstrates the sensitivity
of the population transfer and the produced wave packets on weak perturbations of the
involved states and the corresponding FC overlaps.

In addition to ω810nm

there is a third component ω

≈ 128 cm−1.
This frequency is interpreted in terms of the wave packet in the A-state being ionized
via 2 distinct windows in the coordinate of internuclear distance. The FC window
is situated at the outer turning point at λ = 833 nm and at the inner turning point
at λ = 780 nm. Apparently, the transition between the two regimes takes place at
′810nm
λ = 810 nm. The interpretation of ω
being due to the coherent excitation of
A
vibrational energy levels with ∆v′ = 2 as it was observed in Ref. [24] seems unlikely in
our case. The latter eﬀect is a general feature depending only on the vibrational level
spacing and the spectral width of the laser pulses. Therefore, a doubled frequency 2ωA
should appear in all FT spectra, which is not the case in our measurements. One should
note here that the spectral width of the laser pulses in the experiments of Ref. [24] were
larger by a factor of 1.6 than in our experiments.
The time evolution of frequencies ω810nm

at λ = 810 nm can
be followed in the corresponding spectrogram in Fig. 12. The ground state component
≈ 92 cm−1 is visible during the entire scan and does not reveal any signiﬁcant
ω810nm
X
frequency changes. The frequencies ω810nm
, however, are observable in
the spectrogram only during the ﬁrst 10 ps and do not display any revivals at later
times. Again, this dynamics is associated with the K2 desorbing from the droplets
upon electronic excitation. It is interesting to note that, in contrast to the amplitudes
of components ω810nm
, no signiﬁcant damping of the wave packet motion
in the X-state excited by RISRS is observed. Hence, no signiﬁcant desorption of K2
from the helium droplets occurs as long as only vibrational states of the electronic
ground state X are redistributed. This observation agrees well with the picture of
dopant molecules desorbing from the surface only due to strong evaporation caused by
a sudden perturbation upon spatial expansion of the valence electronic distribution due
to the laser induced transition [51]. The energy deposited into the droplet clearly shows
up as intense blue-shifted sidebands when probing alkali dimer transitions by means
of ﬂuorescence absorption spectroscopy. By ﬁtting an exponential decay function to
the amplitudes of the components ω810nm
in the same way as illustrated
in Fig. 11 (b) at λ = 800 nm one obtains a time constant τ 810nm

inﬂuence of the helium diminishes upon desorption, the FC-window shifts to the outer
turning point. After desorption is complete, ionization of the A-state is suppressed.
Thus a transition from the excitation scheme of type I to the one of type II is taking
place at this wavelength for K2 on helium droplets. Besides the shift of the frequency
ωA at λ = 833 nm, the opening and closing of FC-windows observed at λ = 800 nm is a
clear indication for the dynamics induced by the desorption process of K2 oﬀ the helium
droplets.

evolves diﬀerently at 780 nm

decays slowly at later times. The FC-window seems not to shift suﬃciently during the
desorption for signiﬁcantly changing the detection eﬃciency of the A-state wavepacket.
Presumably, this is due to the fact that the inner part of the K2 dimer potential where
the transition takes place at this wave length is less sensitive to small perturbations by
the external environment.

4. Summary

The wavepacket motion observed by resonant and resonance-enhanced 3PI of K2
on helium nanodroplets at various excitation wave lengths displays a number of
characteristic features as compared to analogous results of gas phase experiments. Let
us summarize the observations giving information about the inﬂuence of the helium
droplet on the wave packet dynamics. At λ = 833 nm, the strong oscillation of the
ion yield due to resonant 3PI is damped with a time constant τ = 3.2(2) ps but a
constant long-lived oscillation persists. On the same timescale the frequency of the
wave packet motion in the A-state shifts by 0.5 cm−1 from 65.8 cm−1 to the gas phase
value, 66.3 cm−1. At λ = 820 nm, no splitting of the maxima in the ion transient due to
inward-outward motion of the wave packet through the FC-window is measured contrary
to gas phase observations. At λ = 810 nm, enhanced RISRS is observed as opposed to
negligible RISRS at moderate laser intensities in the gas phase. The frequency shift
∆ωA at λ = 780 nm is comparable to the one at λ = 833 nm but has opposite sign.

The transient eﬀect of the helium environment appears most prominently in
the wave packet dynamics observed according to the type I scheme. Here, the
ionization eﬃciency depends sensitively on the outer part of the potential curve which
is particularly aﬀected by the interaction with the helium. This explains the strong
amplitude damping and the shifting frequency at λ = 833 nm. The ionization processes
of type II to IV proceed via the inner part of the excited potential curves. Therefore
the inﬂuence of the surrounding helium is expected to be less visible.
In particular,
the time varying perturbation by the helium as the K2 dimers desorb from the droplet
surface causes diﬀerent dynamics. As the ionization scheme gradually evolves from type
I to type II for decreasing wave lengths λ = 833 → 780 nm, the competition of the two
schemes is observable by the appearance and disappearance of the frequency components
connected with the diﬀerent schemes, as observed at λ = 800 nm. Consequently, the
amplitude of ωA at λ = 780 nm (type II process) displays only a weak variation with
time.

In contrast to these ﬁndings, the wave packets excited by RISRS in the ground
state experience no signiﬁcant inﬂuence by the helium environment. The vibrational
frequency remains unshifted with respect to the gas phase, and the amplitude of
the detected wave packet motion in the ground state only weakly varies with time,
presumably reﬂecting a revival structure. Since no change of the valence electronic

Wave packet dynamics of K2 attached to helium nanodroplets

20

distribution occurs upon RISRS, only coupling of the vibrational excitation to the helium
bath might induce perturbations of the wave packet motion. Since the latter is known to
be much weaker than the interaction with the helium droplet upon electronic excitation,
no signiﬁcant perturbations are expected.

In order to draw more quantitative conclusions from our observations quantum
dynamics simulations should be performed, introducing perturbed K2 potential curves
to mimic the inﬂuence of the helium droplet. Also, the process of desorption of alkali
atoms and molecules from helium droplets and, in particular, the impact on the nuclear
wave packet dynamics, is largely unexplored by theory.

The experiments presented in this work clearly demonstrate that the inﬂuence of
the helium matrix on the wave packet dynamics of K2 can be studied in real-time
using fs pump-probe spectroscopy. Surprisingly, this weak coupling quite dramatically
alters the photoionization process which demonstrates the sensitivity of Franck-Condon
factors on helium induced shifts of the potential energies. The time variation of the
Franck-Condon windows and of oscillation frequencies converging to their gas phase
values clearly reﬂects the dynamics of the process of desorption of the K2 dimers oﬀ the
helium droplets, which proceeds on the timescale 3 − 8 ps.

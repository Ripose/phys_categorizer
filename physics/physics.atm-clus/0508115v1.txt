In this work, employing the exchange-only orbital-dependent functional, we have obtained the
optimized eﬀective potential using the simple iterative method proposed by K¨ummel and Perdew
[S. K¨ummel and J. P. Perdew, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 43004-1 (2003)]. Using this method, we have
solved the self-consistent Kohn-Sham equations for closed-shell simple metal clusters of Al, Li, Na,
K, and Cs in the context of jellium model. The results are in good agreement with those obtained
by the diﬀerent method of Engel and Vosko [E. Engel and S. H. Vosko, Phys. Rev. B 50, 10498
(1994)].

INTRODUCTION

In spite of the success of the local density approxi-
mation (LDA)[1] and the generalized gradient approxi-
mations (GGA)[2, 3] for the exchange-correlation (XC)
part of the total energy in the density functional theory
(DFT)[4], it is observed that in some cases these approx-
imations lead to qualitatively incorrect results. On the
other hand, appropriate self-interaction corrected ver-
sions of these approximations are observed[5] to lead to
correct behaviors. These observations motivate one to
use functionals in which the self-interaction contribution
is removed exactly. One of the functionals which sat-
isﬁes this constraint is the exact exchange energy func-
tional. Using the exact exchange functional leads to the
correct asymptotic behavior of the Kohn-Sham (KS) po-
tential as well as to correct results for the high-density
limit in which the exchange energy is dominated. Given
an orbital-dependent exchange functional, one should
solve the optimized eﬀective potential (OEP) integral
equation[6, 7, 8] to obtain the local exchange potential
which is used in the KS equations. Application of this
integral equation to three dimensional systems [9, 10, 11]
needs considerable technicalities and has some limita-
tions. Recently, K¨ummeIvanov99l and Perdew [12, 13]
proposed an iterative method which allows one to solve
the OEP integral equation accurately and eﬃciently.

In this work, using the exact-exchange OEP method,
we have obtained the ground state properties of simple
neutral N -electron metal clusters of Al, Li, Na, K, and Cs
with closed-shell conﬁgurations corresponding to N = 2,
8, 18, 20, 34, and 40 (for Al, only N = 18 corresponds to
real Al cluster with 6 atoms). However, it is a well-known

University, Unit of Mash’had

fact that the properties of alkali metals are dominantly
determined by the delocalized valence electrons. In these
metals, the Fermi wavelengths of the valence electrons
are much larger than the metal lattice constants and the
pseudopotentials of the ions do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect
the electronic structure. This fact allows one to replace
the discrete ionic structure by a homogeneous positive
charge background which is called jellium model (JM).
For closed-shell clusters, the spherical geometry is an ap-
propriate assumption [14, 15, 16] and therefore, we ap-
ply the JM to metal clusters by replacing the ions of an
N -atom cluster with a sphere of uniform positive charge
density and radius R = (zN )1/3rs, where z is the valence
of the atom and rs is the bulk value of the Wigner-Seitz
(WS) radius for valence electrons. For Al, Li, Na, K, and
Cs we take rs=2.07, 3.28, 3.93, 4.96, and 5.63, respec-
tively.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section
II we explain the calculational schemes. Section III is
devoted to the results of our calculations and ﬁnally, we
conclude this work in section IV.

II. CALCULATIONAL SCHEMES

All equations throughout this paper are expressed in Ry-

To solve the KS equations, one should ﬁrst calculate
the local exchange potential from the exchange energy
functional. This is done via the solution of the OEP
integral equation. Recently, K¨ummel and Perdew[12, 13]
in a simple and elegant way have proved that the OEP
integral equation is equivalent to the equation

in which φiσ are the self-consistent KS orbitals and ψiσ
are orbital shifts which are obtained from the solution of
the following inhomogeneous KS equations

the right hand side of Eq. (12), vxσ(r) are the optimized

At the starting point to solve the self-consistent OEP
equations (11)-(15), the self-consistent KLI [17] orbitals
and eigenvalues are used as input. Then we solve Eq.
(11) to obtain the orbital shifts ψiσ. In the next step, we
calculate the quantity

Sσ(r) =

iσ(r)φiσ (r) + c.c.,

(16)

the deviation of which from zero is a measure for the de-
viation from the self-consistency of the OEP-KS orbitals.
This quantity is used to construct a better exchange po-
tential from

orbitals ﬁxed, we repeat the solution of the Eq. (11). Re-
peating the ”cycle” (11), (16), (17) for several times, the
maximum value of Sσ(r) will decrease to a desired small
value (in our case down to 10−8 a. u.). After completing
cycles, the vnew
in conjunction with the KS orbitals are
xσ
used to construct new eﬀective potential to ”iterate” the
KS equations (6). The value of c in Eq. (17) is taken
to be 30 as suggested in Ref.[13]. We have used 10 cy-
cles between two successive iterations. These procedures
are repeated until the self-consistent OEP potentials are
obtained.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Taking spherical geometry for the jellium background,
and solution of self-consistent KS equations, we have ob-
tained the ground state properties of closed-shell 2, 8,
18, 20, 34, and 40-electron neutral clusters of Al, Li, Na,
K, and Cs in the exact-exchange jellium model and com-
pared the results with those of KLI and LSDA.

they are equal and opposite in sign so that they lead to

leads to the coincidence of the KLI and OEP results.

The self-consistent exchange potentials of Li2 and Al18
are plotted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. For com-
parison, the LSDA exchange-correlation potentials are
also included. One notes that in Li2 case, the KLI and
OEP potentials are completely coincident whereas, in Al
case, the KLI and OEP coincide only in the asymptotic
region. On the other hand, the LSDA potential, because
of wrong exponential asymptotic behavior, decays faster
than the KLI or OEP, which have correct asymptotic be-
haviors of 1/r.
In the Al case, N = 18 refers to the
number of electrons which corresponds to the number
n = 6 of Al atoms.

In Figs.

5(a) and 5(b), we have shown the self-
consistent densities for Li2 and Al18, respectively. As
in the potential case, for Li2 the KLI and OEP densities
completely coincide whereas, in Al18 the coincidence is
only at the asymptotic region.

FIG. 4: Exchange potentials in KLI and OEP and exchange-
correlation potentials in LSDA, in Rydbergs, for (a)- Li2 and,
(b)- for Al18. Here 18 refers to the electrons which is equiva-
lent to 6 Al atoms. In Li2 the KLI and OEP completely co-
incide whereas, in Al18 the coincidence occurs at asymptotic
region. The LSDA has wrong exponential decay whereas, KLI
and OEP have correct 1/r decays.

In Table I we have listed the self-consistent calculated
ground state properties of the closed-shell clusters of Al,
Li, Na, K, Cs for N =2, 8, 18, 20, 34, and 40. For com-
parison of our OEP results with those obtained by Engel
and Vosko (EV)[18], we have also included those results
for Na. The EV results are based on gradient expansion
which, in principle, is valid only for slow variations of den-
sity as in a bulk solid. However, for ﬁnite systems such
as clusters or surfaces, the EV results may diﬀer from the
exact OEP results. Comparison of our OEP total ener-
gies with those of EV for Na clusters shows a diﬀerence of
0.002% on average. On the other hand, the EV exchange
energies diﬀer, on average, by 0.001% and the average
diﬀerence in εH is 0.08%. From the computational costs
point of view, these quite small diﬀerences makes the EV
method advantageous for calculations within above men-
tioned accuracies.

Now we compare the total energies and the exchange
energies in the KLI, OEP, and LSDA schemes. Compari-

son of the total energies shows that the OEP energies, on
the average, are 1.2% less than those of the KLI. We do
not compare the total energies of OEP and LSD because
in LSD there exist a correlation contribution. On the
other hand, comparison of the exchange energies shows
that on the average, the exchange energies in the OEP is
0.33% more negative than that of the KLI whereas, it is
9% more negative than the LSD.

An other feature in OEP which should be noted is
the contraction of the KS eigenvalue bands relative to

5

those of KLI. The results in Table I show that for all N ,
the relation ∆OEP < ∆KLI holds. Here, ∆ = εH − εL
is the diﬀerence between the maximum occupied and
minimum occupied KS eigenvalues. For N =2, we have
∆ = 0. The results show that the maximum relative
contraction,|∆OEP − ∆KLI |/∆KLI, is 2.6% which corre-
sponds to Cs18.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In this work, we have considered the exchange-only
jellium model in which we have used the exact orbital-
dependent exchange functional. This model is applied for
the closed-shell simple metal clusters of Al, Li, Na, K, and
Cs. For the local exchange potential in the KS equation,
we have solved the OEP integral equation by the itera-
tive method proposed recently by K¨ummel and Perdew
[13]. By solving the self-consistent KS equations, we have
obtained the ground state energies of the closed-shell
clusters (N = 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40) for the three schemes
of LSD, KLI, and OEP. The KLI and OEP results are
the same for neutral two-electron clusters. However, for
N 6= 2, the densities and potentials in the KLI and OEP
coincide for large r values. The OEP exchange and eﬀec-
tive potentials shows correct behavior of 1/r compared
to the incorrect exponential behavior in the LSD. The
total energies in the OEP are more negative than the
KLI by 1.2% on the average. On the other hand, the
exchange energies in the OEP is about 0.33% more neg-
ative than that in the KLI whereas, it is about 9% more
negative than that in the LSDA. The widths of the occu-
pied bands, εH − εL in the OEP are contracted relative
to those in the KLI by at most 2.6% which corresponds
to Cs18. In spite of the validity of the gradient expan-
sion method for slow variations in density, comparison
of our OEP results with those of EV shows an excellent
agreement.

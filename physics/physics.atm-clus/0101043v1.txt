Abstract

The supergenerator of superparamagnetic system quantum evolution is in-
vestigated in discrete orientation model (DOM). It is shown that the generator
is J-self-adjoint one at the case of potential drift ﬁeld agreed upon magnetic
anisotropy of the sample investigated. Perturbation theory is used for spectral
analysis. The qualitative dependence of resonance absorption spectrum on the
relation between quantum and stochastic parameters is demonstrated.

Introduction

~M

Qualitative and quantitative description of relaxation M¨ossbauer spectra is based on
choosing of some relaxation process model. In the most general model of motion of
magnetic moment ~M (t) suggested by Brown [1] this motion is considered like diﬀusion
sphere in a drift ﬁeld stipulated by the magnetic anisotropy
process on radius
of the pattern. Under Born’s approximation M´ossbauer spectra line shape one can
express in terms of resolvent of the generator of quantum evolution operator of a
nucleus, averaged along all diﬀusion process ~M(t) trajectories. But computation
of averaged evolution operator is connected with solving of complicated diﬀerential
equation system of partial derivatives and can not be done in analytical form. To
avoid this diﬃculty phenomenological models are used, where magnetic moment ~M (t)

position becomes discrete, and process of ~M (t) motion itself is replaced by Markovian
process with ﬁnal number of states, which is described by stochastic matrix with phe-
nomenological transition probabilities of the magnetic moment ~M (t) from one state
(of easy magnetization) to another (so called discrete orientation model (DOM)). In
this case the problem of computation of averaged evolution operator obtains algebraic
character and reduces to inversion of special matrices, which properties and order are
determined by the number of easy magnetization directions, the structure of nucleus
magnet electron system and by the symmetry of pattern. In this direction certain
progress was reached for SP particles with cubic symmetry [2]. Direct account of
symmetry in frames of phenomenological DOM permitted authors [2] to reduce the
calculation of absorption line shape of SP particles to inversion some matrices of
8- and 6- order for cubic symmetry systems with negative and positive magnetic
anisotropy constants respectively.

For the case of large values of reduced barrier α = KV /kT , where K is magnetic
anisotropy constant, k - Boltzmann constant, V - volume of SP particle, T - temper-
ature, DOM parameters one can calculate by the lowest eigenvalues of Fokker-Plank
equation [3], [4], giving evolution of ~M(t) in diﬀusion model [5], and line shape cal-
culated in such a way is the leading term under α
of line shape calculated on
the base of diﬀusion model [6]. For accurate calculation of the line shape error under
substitution of diﬀusion model to discrete one (DOM) ﬁrst of all detailed analysis
of the generator of averaged evolution operator of a nucleus in frames of DOM is
necessary.

In present paper, developing symmetry considerations stated at [2], we investi-
gate the structure of complete averaged evolution operator corresponding to DOM
for cubic symmetry (with 6 and 8 easy magnetization directions on F e57 nucleus) and
some others, maintain it’s spectral analysis in frames of perturbation theory under
assumption of slow relaxation and also describe qualitative picture of spectrum be-
havior in general case (subject to temperature). In proper basis the generator matrix
is composed of equal blocks of 8
8 older diﬀering only by its diagonal elements
composed by combinations of eigenvalues of the stochastic matrix giving DOM. Non-
diagonal part of such block is determined only by the nuclear system structure and
does not depend neither on stochastic variables nor on crystal lattice symmetry type
(on magnetic anisotropy constant sign for cubic symmetry).

stochastic matrix of transition probabilities between easy magnetization states in unit

2 Spectral Analysis of Stochastic Matrices

Let us suppose that easy magnetization axes coincide with axes of 3(4)-order of cube
for the case of negative (positive) magnetic anisotropy constant. We accept the
following indexing of these axes (ﬁg.1,2). For such indexing stochastic matrices of the
Markovian process, giving magnetic moment motion, look in a following way

Spectral analysis of such matrices is well known [2],[9],[10]. In particular P (8) has two
single eigenvalues and two triple ones (ρ = λ1 = 0, η = λ2 = λ3 = λ4 =
2(p+2q +r),
(6p + 4q)), and P (6) has one single, one
ξ = λ5 = λ6 = λ7 =
4(p + q), ζ = λ8 =
6p, ζ = λ4 = λ5 =
double and one triple eigenvalues (ρ = λ1 = 0, ζ = λ2 = λ3 =
λ6 =
2q). In connection with degeneration there is some arbitrariness in choice
of eigenvalues, which can be eliminated by the requirement of deﬁnite symmetry
of eigenvectors with respect to turns around quantization axis z (quantization axis
direction for 3-axial case is diﬀerent from [2] and this is connected with natural for
giving case symmetry). In the case of N = 8(6) in the capacity of such eigenvectors
let us choose states, that under turning at angle π
3 ) around quantization axis z
obtain factor cn = in, n = 0, 1, 2, 3(= exp( 2πin
3 ), n = 0, 1, 2). In the case of N = 8

It should be noted, that strictly speaking the use of probability transition matrices
in produced form is certain assumption, i.e., is adjustment to real continuous diﬀu-
sion process. However, in the case of small diﬀusion (or, that is the same, diﬀusion
at strong ﬁelds) these matrices one can get directly from continuous diﬀusion model
[3],[4] on the base of strict asymptotic analysis of the diﬀusion operator. In addition
it is found that nonzero transition probabilities are only those, that correspond to
transition between potential wells, having attraction domains with common bound-
ary. For matrix P (8) this means that q = r = 0, and for P (6) that q = 0. Moreover,
calculations show that one can obtain symmetrical Markovian matrices only for the
case of potential drift ﬁeld. Non-symmetrical ﬁeld automatically means that transi-
tion probability from one easy magnetization direction to another is not equal to the
inverse one.

3 Reduction of Superoperator

ˆ
G−

1 to Block Form

2 ( 2π

Since superoperator ˆG is invariant with respect to group C4(C3) action, it is nec-
essary to study transformations properties of complete space of quantum-stochastic
states respectively on such action, i.e., to construct basic elements of complete space
of states, that under turning of coordinate system on angle π
3 ) obtain factor cn.
According to selection rules [8] superoperator ˆG in such basis is of block structure.
For this aim it is naturally in quantum variables space to extract states with such
properties relatively group C4(C3) (such kind of states in stochastic variables space
we have constructed above) and than to construct 4(3) nonoverlapping subspaces of
complete quantum-stochastic space, the states of which obtain factor cn under turn-
ing at angle π
3 ) around quantization axis z. How it is shown in [2], invariant with
respect to group C4 subspace in the case N = 8 is divided into two nonoverlapping
subspaces with diﬀerent properties relatively time inversion (symmetry and asymme-
try subspaces). Really, all others subspaces also suppose such division both in 4- and
3-axial cases and also at other symmetries under proper disposition (consistent with
the symmetry) of coordinate system. So it is possible to construct basis in which
superoperator ˆG consists of 8(6) equal blocks of order 8
8, that diﬀer from each
other only by diagonal elements, composed of stochastic matrix eigenvalues combina-
tions. Nondiagonal part of each block is determined only by the transition structure

Block of form D was introduced ﬁrst in [2] for invariant subspace of quantum-
stochastic states antisymmetrical with respect to time inversion (we denote this sub-
space as 0-) in the case N = 8. Remarkably, that other blocks of superoperator ˆL
(that have another symmetry, i.e., that obtain factor cn under turning of coordinate
system on angle π
3 )) have the same form. Moreover, one can show that the same
form of elementary block remains for certain other symmetries, for example for tetra-
hedron symmetry, cylindrical symmetry and some others. So elementary block D is
in some sense universal.

diagonal form convenient for calculations its spectral characteristics (eigenvalues and
eigenvectors). This problem can be solved under assumption that one of terms ˆL or
ˆP composite superoperator ˆG−
1 is small in comparison with another. It is naturally
to assume smallness of stochastic term ˆP . Note that eigenvalues of unperturbed
superoperator ˆL are known explicitly. These eigenvalues are the super-ﬁne transition

5 J-Selfadjointness and Qualitative Spectrum Be-

havior

×

Reductions of operator matrix ˆL + i ˆP to block-diagonal form at mentioned basis
permit to receive eﬀective way of calculating of line shape reduce to inversion of
matrices of 8
8-order corresponding to each block. In the case of equilibrium initial
distribution resonance absorption spectrum is described by the only block of the
superoperator ˆL+i ˆP , namely by that, which is invariant with respect to turns on angle
π
2 ( 2π
3 ) and antisymmetrical relatively time inversion. But if the initial distribution is
arbitrary one it is necessary to know all blocks of the superoperator ˆL + i ˆP for line
shape determination.

The superoperator ˆL + i ˆP spectrum is, generally speaking, complex one, never-
theless, it is possible to get qualitative information on spectrum behavior at diﬀerent
relations between parameters of magnetic and electron spin systems. The superoper-
ator ˆL + i ˆP spectrum lies at lower half-plane and is placed symmetrically relatively

Let us consider for illustration the case of equilibrium initial distribution, which
is described by block 0-. At the limit case of fast relaxation (at high temperatures)
eigenvalues of this block (just as of any other block) belong to imaginary axis, and
this case corresponds to resonance absorption spectrum consisting of the only line of
Lorentz width on the frequency ω. At diminishing of relaxation eigenvalues as before
some time belong to imaginary axis moving on it, because at fast relaxation limit there
are two single and two triple eigenvalues both in 4- and 3-axial case (7),(8), but due to
the J-selfadjointness eigenvalues can leave imaginary axis only by pairs. At certain
moment one of pairs will diverge (and also this can be not one pair from initially
existing pairs in triple eigenvalues but one of anew formed in a process of random
walk along imaginary axis). In this connection resonance absorption spectrum will
have a form of two lines of certain width, symmetrical relatively frequency ω. Under
further diminishing of relaxation parameters new pairs of lines appear, and the width
is decreased. At limit all eigenvalues of the matrix come down from imaginary axis
and are dropped on real axis, that on resonance absorption spectrum correspond to
line shape with peaks on frequencies ω + b

appear on spectrum), the width is decreased as far as eigenvalues approach real axis,
i.e., under diminishing of relaxation or, that is the same, of temperature.

It is necessary to note that symmetrical line shape corresponds to potential drift
ﬁeld (in DOM — to symmetrical matrices P ). Calculations using non-symmetrical
transition probabilities demonstrate non-symmetrical line shape with respect to main
frequency ω.

We develop a semiclassical quasi-static model that quantitatively accounts for experimental data
on the double ionization of nitrogen molecules for a wide range of laser intensities from tunnelling
regime to over-barrier regime. With this model, we achieve insight into the correlated dynamics of
two valence electrons in combined two-center nuclear attraction and intense laser force, and reveal
the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of molecular alignment on double ionization yield.

Experimental data from double ionization (DI) of
atoms and molecules by short intense laser pulses are of
great interest in strong-ﬁeld physics because they reveal
highly correlated electron-electron behavior[1, 2, 3, 4].
For molecules have more degrees of freedom than atoms,
their DI dynamics is expected to be more complicated.
Evidence is that recent data exposed the signiﬁcant in-
ﬂuence of molecular structure as well as molecular align-
ment on both double ionization yield and ionized-electron
momentum distributions[5, 6, 7].

Even for

simple hydrogen-molecule-like nitrogen
molecule, physics behind its double ionization data is far
from being settled, and theoretical exploration is exten-
sive. The fully time-dependent dynamics of the pairwise
e
e responding to two-center nuclear attraction and laser
−
force poses a daunt challenge for any quantum theoreti-
cal treatment[8]. Recent years witness the renaissance of
classical treatment because evidence has been accumu-
lating that a purely classical scenario is consistent with
many of the observed double-ionization eﬀects[9, 10].
However, purely classical treatment has its unreachable
regime of quantum tunnelling, where most current exper-
iments work. Therefore, results from the above purely
classical calculations can not be compared with experi-
mental data quantitatively.

i.e.,

In this letter, we provide an alternative way, i.e, semi-
classical approach. Our semiclassical quasi-static model
is capable to quantitatively account for the DI experi-
mental data of nitrogen molecules for a wide range of
from tunnelling regime to over-
laser intensities,
barrier regime (see Fig.1). With this model, we re-
produce unusual excess DI rate in the range from 5
×
1013W/cm2 to 1
1015W/cm2, where DI yield could be
one million times higher than that calculated from uncor-
related sequential theory.
In particular, the signiﬁcant
inﬂuence of molecular alignment on DI yield is virtually
revealed by our model.

Model.— We consider a molecule of two valence
electrons interacting with a laser pulse whose tem-
poral and spatial distribution is expressed as ε(t) =
ε0(RL, ZL) sin2( πt
nT ) cos(ωt)ez. The external ﬁeld along
the propagation direction of the laser beam is approx-

treated as an ideal Gaussian beam, i.e., ε0(RL, ZL) =
0), where ε0 is the peak laser
ε0(RL) = ε0 exp(
ﬁeld, RL represents the position of the molecules in the
laser beam, and R0 is the radius of the beam. A sin2
enveloped laser with the full width of nT is used in our
calculations, where T and ω are period and angular fre-
quency of the laser ﬁeld respectively and n denotes the
number of optical cycles.

In the long-wavelength limit, the above laser ﬁeld
varies slowly in time and can be regarded as a quasi-
static ﬁeld compared to valence electron’s circular mo-
tion around nuclei. Under this ﬁeld, the Coulomb poten-
tial between nuclei and electrons is signiﬁcantly distorted.
When the instantaneous ﬁeld (at time t0) is smaller than
a threshold value (see Fig.2(a)), one electron is released

regime as schematically plotted in Fig.2. To our knowledge,
the results from our theoretical model are the ﬁrst to be in
good agreement with experimental data for a wide range of
laser intensities from tunnelling regime to over-barrier regime.

The above scheme is a direct extension of our quasi-
static model for atomic DI[14] and is available only when
instantaneous ﬁeld is below the threshold value. To give
a complete description of the DI of molecular system
for the whole range of the laser intensities (see Fig.1),
it is required to further extend our model to the over-
barrier regime (Fig.2b). This is done by constructing
initial conditions with double-electron microcanoni-

105 weighted (i.e., by rate ̟(t0)) classical trajectories of
electron pairwise are traced and a few thousands or more
of DI events are collected for statistics. Convergency of
the numerical results is further tested with increasing the
number of launched trajectories twice.

Results and Discussions.— Nitrogen molecule is used
to demonstrate our theory. The internuclear separation
is 2.079a.u. and Ip1 = 0.5728a.u., Ip2 = 0.9989a.u.. The
laser frequency is ω = 0.05695a.u. corresponding to a
wavelength of 800nm. The number of optical cycle is cho-
sen as 37 a.u. to match the experiments of Cornaggia[3].

The threshold value of 0.185 PW/cm2 separates the
DI data into two parts. When peak laser intensity is
below this value, there exist two dominant processes re-
sponsible for emitting both electrons, namely, collision-
ionization(CI) and collision-excitation-ionization(CEI),
as shown in Fig.3(a)(b), respectively. For CI, the tun-
nelled electron is driven back by the oscillating laser ﬁeld
to collide with the bounded electron near its parent ions
causing an instant (
attosecond) ionization. For CEI,

molecular ADK formula[11].

The electron tunnels out through a saddle point[10]
directing to a channel of the local minimum in the com-
bined potential of the Coulomb interaction and the exter-
nal ﬁeld (see, Fig.2(c)). Because the diﬀerence between
the direction of the saddle point and the external ﬁeld
is very small, we safely regard the external ﬁeld direc-
tion (z axis) as the tunnelling direction. Thus, the initial
position of the tunnelled electron can be derived from

stantaneous laser ﬁeld is above the threshold value, over-
barrier ionization emerges.
In this regime we observe
more complicated trajectories for DI processes. Except
for CI (Fig.3(c)) and CEI (Fig.3(d)) trajectories simi-
lar to tunnelling case, there are multiple-collision tra-
jectories as shown in Fig.3(e),(f) as well as collision-
less trajectory of Fig.3(g). In Fig.3(e) and (f), initially
two valence electrons entangle each other, experience a
multiple-collision and then emit. The four types of tra-
jectories indicated by Fig.3(c-f) represent the dominant
processes of DI in the plateau regime from 0.185PW/cm2

to 0.5PW/cm2, that are much more complicated than
that of tunnelling regime, but still accompanied by once
or multiple times of collisions between two electrons[16].
However, above 0.5PW/cm2, the DI is dominated by a

from our model agree with ADK theory.

Analysis on trajectories of e-e pairs achieves insight
into the complicated dynamics of DI, where important in-
formation is indicated by the laser ﬁeld phase at the mo-
ments of collision and ionization[17, 18]. We choose three
typical laser intensities, 0.12PW/cm2, 0.4PW/cm2 and
1PW/cm2, representing the tunnelling regime, plateau
regime and sequential ionization regime, respectively.

Fig.4(a) shows the diagram of DI yield vs laser phase at
the moment of closest collision. In the tunnelling regime
(i.e., 0.12PW/cm2), we note that the collision can occur
throughout most of the laser cycle and the peak emerges
slightly before the zeroes of the laser ﬁeld, consistent with
the prediction of simple-man model[19] and recent results
from purely classical calculation[9]. However, for other
two cases, the collision between two correlated electron
turns to occur mainly at peak laser ﬁeld. This is because
ionization mechanism changes at the transition to over-
barrier regime, where both electrons rotate around nuclei
and their distance could be very close before one of them
is driven away by the external ﬁeld.

Fig.4(b) conﬁrms that most DI occurs around the
maximum of laser ﬁeld for both tunnelling regime and
over-barrier regime. More interestingly, compared to

lows. For the intensity of 0.12PW/cm2, the maximal ki-
netic energy of the returned electron is 3.17Up = 0.85a.u.,
still smaller than the ionization energy of N +

the assistance of the Coulomb focusing[20], it is not easy

that
the ejection of electrons in the same-hemisphere and
opposite-hemisphere emerge alternately with respect to
the delayed time. For a time delay of odd half laser cy-
cles, two electrons emit in the same direction, for a time
delay of even half laser cycles, two electrons emit in the
opposite direction. Moreover, in the tunnelling regime
the pattern in Fig.5(a) shows two signally bright spot in
the ﬁrst and third quadrants when the delayed time is
less than 0.5T, a phenomenon directly due to the CI tra-
jectories. The above observation supports the picture of
attosecond electron thermalization of tunnelling reigme
[21]. On the other hand, the irregular pattern emerges
in Fig.5(b) for DI in the plateau regime as the signature
of complicated multiple-collision trajectories.

In our producing data in Fig.1 the molecular alignment
is set to be random and our result is obtained by averag-
ing over diﬀerent alignment directions. Recent progress
in experimental technique makes it possible to control
molecular alignment by applying a weak pre-pulse[7].
With this consideration and further application of our
model, we calculate the ratios between double and sin-
gle ionization according to diﬀerent molecular alignment
angles. Main results are presented in Fig.6.
It shows
that, i) The ratio between DI and single-ionization yield
is less for perpendicular molecules than that of parallel
molecules; ii) This anisotropy becomes more dramatic
for a shorter laser pulse. Further explorations show that
molecular alignment also signiﬁcantly aﬀects the corre-
lated momentum distribution of emitted electrons. De-
tails will be presented elsewhere[12].

In summary, we have developed a semiclassical quasi-
static model that can be used to compared with exper-
imental data of molecular DI quantitatively under the
relevant experimental conditions, i.e., highly nonpertur-
bative ﬁelds with femtosecond or shorter time resolution.
With this model, we have achieved insight into the DI
dynamics of molecules and revealed the signiﬁcant eﬀect
of molecular alignment on DI yield. The latter can be re-
garded as our theoretical prediction waiting for test from
future’s experiments.

momentum exchange in ﬁnal state is negligible (these
assumptions have been checked by directly tracing tra-
jectories), the parallel momentum k||1,2, of each electron

In all three
cases we observe a long-tail up to several optical periods.
For the sequential ionization of 1PW/cm2, it means af-
ter one electron is deprived from nuclei by laser ﬁelds the
other electron is slowly (i.e., waiting for up to 10 optical
periods) ionized. In the tunnelling regime, the long-tail
indicates that CEI mechanism is very pronounced for the
molecular DI (contribute to 80% of total DI yield). This
observation is diﬀerent from purely classical sinulation[9],
where CI eﬀect is believed to be overestimated. Our re-
sults, however, are consistent with experiments of Ar
atom[17], where ionization potential and laser ﬁeld pa-

Tight-binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) is used to
study the structural and electronic properties of silver clus-
ters. The ground state structures of Ag clusters up to 21
atoms are optimized via TBMD combined with genetic algo-
rithm (GA). The detailed comparison with ab initio results
on small Agn clusters (n = 3 − 9) proves the validity of the
tight-bind model. The clusters are found to undergo a tran-
sition from “electronic order” to “atomic order” at n = 10.
This is due to s-d mixing at such size. The size dependence
of electronic properties such as density of states (DOS), s-
d band separation, HOMO-LUMO gap, and ionization po-
tentials are discussed. Magic number behavior at Ag2, Ag8,
Ag14, Ag18, Ag20 is obtained, in agreement with the predic-
tion of electronic ellipsoid shell model. It is suggested that
both the electronic and geometrical shell exist in the coinage
metal clusters and they play a signiﬁcant role in determining
cluster properties.

I. INTRODUCTION

The structural and electronic properties of metal clus-
ters are currently a ﬁeld of intensive research both the-
oretically and experimentally1–3. The basic theoretical
concept in the electronic structure of alkali metal clusters
is the shell model based on jellium sphere (or ellipsoid)
approximation1,2, which has successfully interpreted the
magic number eﬀect in Nan and Kn clusters (n =2, 8, 20,
40, · · ·). As compared to alkali-metal clusters, the appli-
cation of electronic shell model to coinage-metal clusters
(Cun, Agn, Aun) is somewhat questionable due to the
existence of inner d electrons. Among the noble metal
clusters, Agn is expected to exhibit the largest similarity
to the alkali metal clusters as the 4d orbitals in Ag atom
are low-lying and act almost like innershell core orbitals.
Experimental studies on silver clusters include mass-
ionization potentials (IPs)5,6, photoelectron
spectra4,
spectra7–9, electron spin resonance (ESR)10, optical res-
onance absorption11, etc. In general, most of the cluster
properties resemble the predictions of shell model within
one s electron picture. But there are still some experi-
mental evidences for Agn that are diﬀerent from alkali-
metal clusters and cannot be understood via the shell
model of s electrons. For instance, the Mie resonance
peak of silver clusters exhibit blue shift with decreas-
ing cluster radius11, while red shift of Mie resonance fre-

1

quency is found for alkali-metal clusters. A direct com-
parison of photoelectron spectra between Agn and Nan
display signiﬁcant diﬀerence that might be attributed to
the d orbitals8. Therefore, it is important to clarify the
contribution of 4d electrons and s − d interaction in the
silver clusters and the geometrical eﬀect on the electronic
properties of the clusters.

Besides shell model, the metal clusters have been inves-
tigated by accurate quantum chemical approaches based
on molecular orbital theory3. However, such ab initio
calculations on coinage metal clusters are quite time con-
suming and limited in small size12–15. Among those
works, the most detailed and comprehensive study of
small neutral silver clusters (Ag2 to Ag9) has been per-
formed via conﬁguration interaction (CI) method with
relativistic eﬀective core potential (RECP)14. On the
other hand, the electronic structures of several larger
silver clusters has been approximately described by a
modiﬁed H¨uckel model16. However, all these studies are
carried out for limited number of structural candidates
with symmetry constrain. An unbiased minimization for
the cluster ground state structure incorporated with elec-
tronic structure calculations would be much more infor-
mative for understanding the interplay between geomet-
rical and electronic structure and testing the validity of
electronic shell model.

Up to now, the most reliable and accurate procedure
in dynamic searching of cluster equilibrium geometries is
provided by Car-Parrinello (CP) method with simulated
annealing (SA)17. But such kind of ab initio simulation
is also limited in small size (about n ≤ 10) in a truly
global optimization because of the rapidly increase in
computational expense with cluster size. Among coinage
metal clusters, the CP method has been employed to
study small Cun clusters (n = 2 − 10) recently18, but
the corresponding investigation on silver and gold clus-
ters is not available so far. In recent years, tight-binding
molecular dynamics has been developed as an alternative
to CP method in atomistic simulation for larger scaled
systems19. As compared to ab initio methods, the pa-
rameterized tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian reduces the
computational cost dramatically. It is more reliable than
classical simulation based on empirical potential since the
atomic motion is directly coupled with electronic struc-
ture calculation at each steps. For transition-metal clus-
ters, M.Menon and co-workers have proposed a minimal
parameter tight-binding scheme and used it to study
nickel and iron clusters20,21. In this work, we shall in-
troduce a similar TB model for silver. By using the

TBMD as a local minimization approach, genetic algo-
rithm (GA)22–25 is employed to search the global min-
imal structure of Agn clusters up to 21 atoms. The
size dependence of relative stabilities, density of states
(DOS), HOMO-LUMO gaps, and ionization potentials
of the clusters are calculated and compared with avail-
able experimental results. The magic eﬀect of electronic
shell and the interplay between geometrical and elec-
tronic structure in silver clusters are discussed.

II. THEORETICAL METHOD

In the minimal parameter tight-binding scheme pro-
posed by M.Menon et al.20, the total binding energy Eb
of transition-metal atoms is written as a sum:

Eb = Eel + Erep + Ebond.

(1)

Eel is the electronic band structure energy deﬁned as the
sum of one-electron energies for the occupied states

Eel =

ǫk

occ

(2)

where energy eigenvalues ǫk can be obtained by solving
orthogonal 9n × 9n TB Hamiltonian including 4d, 5s and
5p electrons. The repulsive energy Erep is described by
a pair potential function χ(r) of exponential form:

Vλλ′µ(d) = Vλλ′µ(d0)(

(6)

d0
d

)τ +2

The parameter τ = 0 for s-s, s-p, p-p interactions, τ =
3/2 for s-d and p-d interaction, τ = 3 for d-d interaction.
In present, we have adopted the Slater-Koster hopping
integrals Vλλ′µ(d0) and the on-site orbital energy from
the values ﬁtted to ﬁrst principle APW band structure
calculation of bulk silver27. Furthermore, to transfer the
on-site orbital energies levels from bulk calculation to
atomic limit, a constant energy shift ∆ǫ=-15.88 eV is
applied on the on-site energies from Ref.27. Such shift
in on-site levels make the theoretical ionization potential
of Agn clusters quantitatively comparable to experimen-
tal values. The repulsive potential parameter χ0 is ﬁtted
for experimental bond length 2.48 ˚A of silver dimer28.
The bond-counting terms a, b are chosen to reproduce
the ab initio binding energy for small clusters Ag3, Ag4,
12,14,15. All the parameters used in our calculation
Ag5
are listed in Table I. These empirical parameters can de-
scribe both bulk phase and dimer of silver with an accept-
able accuracy. The cohesive energy 2.75 eV, equilibrium
interatomic distance 2.88 ˚A of fcc solid silver from TB
model are close to the corresponding experimental value
2.95 eV and 2.89 ˚A respectively26. The vibrational fre-
quency and binding energy calculated for silver dimer at
equilibrium distance is 125.5 cm−1 and 1.25 eV, in rea-
sonable agreement with experimental data of 192.4 cm−1
and 1.66 eV29.

It should be noted that only the ﬁrst two terms Eel and
Erep in Eq.(1) contribute to the interatomic forces in
TBMD simulation, while the Ebond term is added after
the relaxation has been achieved. However, for metal
clusters, this correction term is signiﬁcant in distinguish-
ing various isomers at a given cluster size20.

The 9n × 9n TB Hamiltonian matrix is constructed
with Slater-Koster scheme, while the distance scaling of
hopping integrals Vλλ′µ is taken as the Harrison’s univer-
sal form27:

The determination of lowest energy structures of clus-
ters is performed by a genetic algorithm (GA)22–25. The
essential idea of this novel global optimization strategy
is to mimic the Darwinian biological evolution process
in which only the ﬁttest candidate can survive. Some
pioneering works have demonstrated the impressive ef-
ﬁciency of GA in searching the global minima of clus-
ters as compared to standard simulated annealing. At
beginning, we generate a number Np of initial conﬁgura-
tions by random (Np = 4 − 16, depending upon cluster
size). Any two candidates in this population can be cho-
sen as parents to generate a child cluster through mat-
ing process. In the end of mating procedure, mutation
operation is allowed to apply on the geometrical struc-
ture of child cluster with 30% possibility. The child clus-
ter from each generation is relaxed by TBMD quenching
of 300-500 MD steps with ∆t = 5f s. Then the locally
minimized child is selected to replace its parent in the
population if it has diﬀerent geometry but lower binding
energy. Typically, 100−150 GA iterations is suﬃcient to
ensure a truly global search up to n = 21. The detailed
description about the practical operation of GA is given
elsewhere25,30.

III. STRUCTURES AND STABILITIES OF
SLIVER CLUSTERS

A. Structures of small Agn with n ≤ 9

By using the combined GA-TBMD strategy, we have
explored the global minimal structures of Agn clusters up
to 21 atoms. These ground state structures are shown
in Fig.1 (4 ≤ n ≤ 9) and Fig.2 (10 ≤ n ≤ 21).
In
Table II, the structural parameters (bond lengths and
bond angles), binding energies and ionization potentials
of the small Agn clusters (n = 3 − 9) in ground state and
some metastable structures are compared with accurate
quantum chemistry calculations12–15. The lowest energy
structures found for most of the clusters coincide well
with intensive CI calculations in Ref.14 and the other
works12,13,15. The calculated cluster properties of ground
state and metastable isomers agree with ab initio results
quantitatively. As shown in Table I, the TB bond lengths
are typically within 0.05−0.15 ˚A according to the ab
initio values. The average deviation of binding energy per
atom and ionization potentials from this work to ab initio
calculations14 is about 0.13 eV and 0.30 eV respectively.

FIG. 1. Lowest-energy structures for Agn (n = 4 − 9) clus-

ters.

For silver trimer, isosceles triangle is about 0.05 eV
lower in energy than equilateral triangle and 0.84 eV
9
lower than the linear isomer. ESR experiments on Ag3
supports the isosceles triangle structure with C2v symme-
try. In the case of Ag4, planar rhombus is lower in energy
than a relaxed tetrahedron by ∆E=0.31 eV although
the tetrahedron has higher coordination and has been
predicted as most stable structure by using a classical
many-body potential30. This discrepancy demonstrates
the importance of incorporating the electronic structure
in determining cluster geometries. The lowest energy
structure found for Ag5 is a compressed trigonal bipyra-
mid, which has lower energy (∆E=0.17 eV) than a planar
capped rhombus. In previous studies, the planar struc-
ture has been obtained as ground state12,14,15 but the en-
ergy diﬀerence between these two isomers is rather small
(∆E=0.31 eV in Ref.12 and ∆E= 0.003 eV in Ref.14). It
is noted that the experimental ESR spectra of Ag5 can be
interpreted by a geometrical structure of deformed trig-
onal bipyramid. Two isoenergitic structures, a bicapped
tetrahedron and a pentagonal pyramid are found for Ag6,
with ∆E=0.05 eV. The bicapped tetrahedron is more sta-
ble but this conclusion depends sensitively on the choice
of empirical parameters. In Ref.14, these two structures
are also found to be very close in energy (∆E = 0.06 eV)
but the pentagonal pyramid is ground state. Accord-
ing to the theoretical HOMO-LUMO gap of these two
isomers, we suggest that the bicapped tetrahedron is a
better candidate since its HOMO-LUMO gap (1.05 eV) is
much smaller than that obtained for pentagonal pyramid
(2.67 eV), whereas experimental gap is about 0.34 eV7.
The pentagonal bipyramid is obtained as lowest energy
structure for Ag7. The tricapped tetrahedron is a locally
stable isomer with ∆E =0.48 eV, while the ∆E in Ref.14
for the same isomer is 0.41 eV. For silver octamer, a bi-
capped octahedron is our ground state structure, which
18. This near-spherical conﬁgura-
is also found for Cu8
tion can be understood by electronic shell model. The
closure of electronic shell at n = 8 might give rise to
a spherical charge density distribution, which favors the
formation of spherical atomic arrangement. The tetra-
capped tetrahedron is predicted as metastable isomer in

(D4d) is found as a local stable isomer with ∆E=0.99 eV.
For Ag9, the ground state structure is a bicapped pen-

From the above discussions for small silver clusters,
we ﬁnd that the agreement between TB model and ab
initio calculations is satisfactory, particularly consider-
ing the simplicity in the present tight-binding scheme.
Therefore, in the next part, we shall use this model to
study larger clusters with n ≥ 10 for which the global
minimization with ab initio molecular dynamics is much
more expensive.

B. Structures of Agn with 10 ≤ n ≤ 21

FIG. 2. Lowest-energy structures for Agn (n = 10 − 21)

clusters. See text for description of structures.

The lowest energy structure of Agn (n = 10 − 21) ob-
tained from GA-TBMD simulation is shown in Fig 2.
The most stable structure of Ag10 is a deformed bicapped
square antiprism (D4d), which is similar to that found for
18. Starting from Ag11, the ground state structures
Cu10
of Agn clusters are based on icosahedral packing, except
for Ag14. Many other capped polyhedral structures are
obtained as local isomers for Agn with n =10-21 but it is
not necessary to describe them herein. As shown in Fig.2,
the structures of Ag11, Ag12 are the uncompleted icosa-
hedron with lack of one or two atoms. An Jahn-Teller
distorted icosahedron is then formed at Ag13. Follow-
ing the icosahedral growth sequence, the lowest energy
structures of Ag15, Ag16, Ag17 is the icosahedron capped
with 2, 3, 4 atoms respectively. The capped single icosa-
hedron transits into an truncated double icosahedron at
Ag18 and a complete double icosahedron at the Ag19.
Base on the double icosahedron structure, the structures
of Ag20 and Ag21 is formed by one and two atoms capped
on that of Ag19. However, an exception occur at Ag14,

5

for which we found a fcc-like packing with 4-1-4-1-4 lay-
ered structure. This ellipsoid structure is more stable
than a spherical capped icosahedron structure by 0.03
eV. It is worth noted that 14 is a magic size predicted by
a ellipsoid shell model1,30.

C. Crossover from “electronic order” to “atomic
order”

The concept of “particle order” (or “atomic order”)
and “wave order” (or “electronic order”) in cluster
physics32 have been introduced in order to explain the
magic number eﬀect in the inert gas clusters with atomic
shell and alkali metal clusters with electronic shell. The
noble metal cluster is a mixture of the atomic core in-
volving the relatively localized d electrons and the more
delocalized s valence electrons. Therefore, it might be a
intermediated system from these two extreme limit and
exhibit features come from both the two orders. The
equilibrium structures of small silver clusters (Ag3−Ag9)
from our calculation are similar to those of alkali-metal
clusters3. In contrast, the icosahedron growth sequence
is obtained for clusters starting from Ag11 that has also
been found for noble gas clusters33.
In smaller silver
clusters, the 5s valence electrons are dominant in deter-
mining the cluster property and the d states are signiﬁ-
cantly lower-lying and contribute much less to the cluster
bonding. Therefore, these small clusters should exhibit
certain alkali-metal-like behavior in both structural and
electronic aspects. As the clusters size increase, the con-
tribution of d electrons to cluster bonding become more
and more important. The bonding energy from d elec-
trons is roughly related to the d band width34, which
is approximately proportional to the square root of the
average coordination number of the clusters35. Conse-
quently, the clusters tend to adopt the more compact
structures such as icosahedron, which is similar to no-
ble gas clusters33. The switch of structural pattern from
alkali-metal like to noble gas like at around n=10 can be
identiﬁed as a crossover from “electronic order” towards
“atomic order” in the silver clusters. This alternation is
related to the overlap of 4d and 5s electronic states which
we will discussed latter. However, our further study show
that the shell structure of s electrons still dominates the
electronic properties such as IPs, HOMO-LUMO gaps
of the silver clusters although the geometrical structures
has taken “atomic order”. We argue that the “electronic
order” and “atomic order” can coexist in coinage metal
clusters.

D. Size dependence of relative stabilities

The second diﬀerences of cluster binding energies de-
ﬁned by ∆2E(n) = Eb(n + 1) + Eb(n − 1) − 2Eb(n) is
In cluster physics, it
calculated and plotted in Fig.3.

is well known that the ∆2E(n) is a sensitive quantity
which reﬂects the stability of clusters and can be directly
compared to the experimental relative abundance. Three
major characteristics can be found in the Fig.3: (i) even-
odd alternation of ∆2E(n) with n = 2 − 6, 15 − 21; (ii)
particular high peak at Ag8, Ag18; (iii) other maxima
at odd size like Ag13 and Ag11. The ﬁrst eﬀect can be
related to the even-odd oscillation of HOMO energy and
HOMO-LUMO gap in silver clusters, which is due to elec-
tron pairing eﬀect. The articular stable clusters such as
Ag8, Ag18 corresponds to the magic number in electronic
shell model. However, the even-odd oscillation in ∆2E(n)
from Ag10 to Ag14 and the maximum at magic size Ag20
have not been observed in our calculation. In stead, some
odd-sized cluster as Ag11, Ag13 become maxima in Fig.3.
These phenomena can be attributed to the geometrical
eﬀect. The closing of geometrical shell of icosahedron
at Ag13 will enhance the stability of such clusters and
reduce the relative stability of their neighboring clusters.

∆E(n) = [Eb(Agn−1) + Eb(Agn+1)] − 2Eb(Agn) as a func-

eﬀect at n = 2, 8, 18 and geometrical shell eﬀect at Ag13 can
be identiﬁed. See text for details.

The simultaneous appearance of those three features
in the ∆2E(n) demonstrates that the structure and sta-
bility of a silver cluster is determined by both electronic
structure and atomic conﬁguration. Either electronic or
geometrical eﬀect is enhanced if the corresponding shell
structure is completed. This argument is supported by a

6

experimental probe of geometrical and electronic struc-
ture of copper clusters36. They found both jellium-like
electronic behavior and icosahedral geometrical structure
in copper clusters.

spectra of ionized silver clusters4, dramatic even-odd os-
cillation as well as substantial discontinuities at electronic
magic number 8, 20 (n = 9, 21 for cationic clusters) are
found. The discrepancy between present theoretical re-
sult and experiment may be partially attributed to the
eﬀect of ionization on the cluster stability. Since the ex-
perimental mass spectra distribution is recorded for ion-
ized clusters Ag+
n , it is possible that the charging on the
cluster can signiﬁcantly alter the geometrical and elec-
tronic structure of the cluster3,14.

IV. ELECTRONIC PROPERTIES VS CLUSTER
SIZE

A. Size evolution of electronic band

We investigated the cluster electronic properties via
the electronic density of states (DOS). In Fig.4, we
present the total spd electronic DOS for Ag2, Ag8, Ag13
along with bulk DOS of fcc crystal silver from TB cal-
culation in reciprocal space. Generally, the total DOS
is composed by the relatively compact d states and the
more expanded sp states.
In smallest clusters such as
Ag2, the d and sp bands are clearly separated. The sp
states shows discrete peaks originated from symmetrical
splitting of atomic orbital levels, while the d band is low-
lying and considerably narrower than the bulk d band. In
contrast to even-odd behavior and shell occupation of s
electrons, the evolution of d states from smallest clusters
towards bulk solid is a monotonic broaden of band width.
As the cluster size increases, both d and sp levels grad-
ually broaden, shift, overlap with each other, and ﬁnally
come into being bulk electronic band. The DOS of Ag8
still has molecular-like some discrete sp peaks but these
electronic spectra peaks tend to overlap and form con-
tinuous band. In Ag13, the sp states have developed into
several subbands and the d band has overlapped with sp
states. Although the DOS of Ag13 is roughly similar to
the bulk limit, the width of d band is still considerably
narrower than the bulk d band width and the ﬁne struc-
ture of sp electronic spectra is somewhat diﬀerent from
bulk sp band. This fact suggests that the bulk-like be-
havior emerge at around Ag13. We have also studied the
electronic states of Ag55 with icosahedral and cubocta-
hedral structures by using present tight-binding scheme
with local minimization. The DOS for both of them are
much closer to bulk band.
In a previous experimental
study of photoelectron spectra of silver clusters up to
60 atoms8, it is found that the ultraviolet photoelectron
spectroscopy (UPS) of smallest Agn, i.e., 2 ≤ n ≤ 10 is
diﬀerent from bulk UPS and changes sensitively on clus-
ter size. The size dependent variation of UPS for Agn

with n < 10 becomes more gradual and the UPS of Ag60
is already very close to that of solid silver.

Cluster Size n

FIG. 4. Density of states (DOS) of Agn (n = 2, 8, 13)
clusters vs cluster as well as bulk DOS in fcc crystalline (with
Gaussian broaden of 0.02 eV).

To further clarify the size evolution of the overlap of
d and sp bands in the small silver clusters, we have ex-
amined the energy separation ∆sd between the highest
molecular orbitals belong to d states and lowest molecu-
lar orbitals from s states. The calculated ∆sd decrease
rapidly from 5.20 eV for Ag2, to 1.69 eV for Ag5 and
then to 0.10 eV for Ag8. Finally, the d and sp band
merge in Agn clusters with n ≥ 9. The overlap between s
and d band is believed to induce the icosahedral growth
sequence starting from Ag11 and weaken the even-odd
oscillation in HOMO-LUMO gaps and IPs of Agn clus-
ters with n > 10. However, the overlap between sp and
d states is small and the cluster HOMO is still located
in the s-like electronic states. Consequently, the contri-
bution from d electrons in Agn with n > 9 shows more
importance to cluster bonding although the electronic be-
havior close to Fermi energy such as HOMO-LUMO gap,
ionization potentials is still dominated by s orbitals.

FIG. 5. HOMO-LUMO gap ∆ (eV) vs cluster size n. The
theoretical values are labeled by solid square connected with
solid line and the experimental values in Ref.[7] are labeled
by open circles. Electronic shell eﬀect for n = 2, 8, 18 can be
clearly identiﬁed.

An important electronic property of a cluster is the
gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In the
case of magic cluster, the closure of electronic shell shall
manifest itself in particularly large HOMO-LUMO gap.
This eﬀect was demonstrated experimentally for small
even-sized silver and copper clusters7 and theoretically
for copper clusters37,38. The theoretical HOMO-LUMO
gap of Agn (n = 2 − 21) along with experimental gap
of small clusters Agn (n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)7 are shown
in Fig.5. Even-odd oscillation up to Ag16 as well as
the particularly large HOMO-LUMO gap at Ag2, Ag8,
and Ag18 are obtained. As compared to the experimen-
tal results for small Agn with even size, the present TB
calculation has systematically overestimated the HOMO-
LUMO electronic gap by about 0.5 eV. But the size de-
pendent variation of experimental gaps and magic eﬀect
in HOMO-LUMO gaps at n =2, 8 are well reproduced.
The even-odd alternation for n ≥ 16 and magic eﬀect
of Ag20 have not been obtained in our calculation. We
suggest these are probably due to the geometrical eﬀect,
since the HOMO-LUMO gap of cluster depends sensi-
tively on cluster structure37.
In a previous study of

7

HOMO-LUMO gaps of copper clusters37, the maxima
gap at Ag8 and Ag20 is found but the even-odd alterna-
tion of electronic gap and magic eﬀect for Ag18 have not
been obtained.

C. Ionization potential

The vertical ionization potentials (IPs) of clusters are
evaluated from the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO) energy of neutral clusters according to Koop-
man’s theorem.
In Fig.6, the calculated IPs of Agn
up to n = 21 is compared with the IP values mea-
sured by C.Jackschath5, the prediction by metallic spher-
ical droplet model39, and the size dependent HOMO
level (in arbitrary units) of alkali-like metal clusters by
Clemenger-Nilsson ellipsoid shell model1,31. In compari-
son with experimental values in Ref.[5], the present TB
calculation has almost reproduced the size dependence
of IPs for silver clusters up to 21 atoms except that the-
oretical calculation has overestimated the IP values of
some magic clusters such as Ag2, Ag8, and Ag18. Two
important size dependent behaviors are found in Fig.6:
(i) dramatic even-odd alternations where clusters with
even number of s valence electrons have higher IPs than
their immediate neighbors; (ii) particular higher IP val-
ues at the magic clusters such as Ag2, Ag8, Ag18, Ag20
and probably Ag14. The even-odd variations can be at-
tributed to electron pairing eﬀect. Odd(even)-sized clus-
ters have an odd(even) total number of s valence elec-
trons and the HOMO is singly(doubly) occupied. The
electron in a doubly occupied HOMO feels a stronger
eﬀective core potential since the electron screening is
weaker for the electrons in the same orbital than for in-
ner shell electrons. Therefore, the binding energy of a
valence electron in a cluster of even size cluster is larger
than that of odd one. It is also interesting to note that
the size dependence of IPs from TB model is almost in
full accordance to Clemenger-Nilsson shell model. The
magic eﬀect at Ag2, Ag8, Ag14, Ag18, and Ag20 pre-
dicted by electronic shell model is well reproduced even
though the cluster geometries and s-d interaction has
been considered. On the other hand, one can found that
both the theoretical and experimental IP values for silver
clusters can be roughly described by a classical electro-
static model which take the cluster as a metallic spherical
droplet. This fact further suggests that the electronic be-
havior of silver clusters are predominantly s-like and the
cluster can be approximated to be a structureless jellium
sphere with shell-like electronic levels.

V. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have shown that the present TB
model is able to describe the geometrical and electronic
structures of silver clusters. By using a combined GA-
TBMD technique, the lowest energy structures, binding
energies, electronic states, s-d separation, HOMO-LUMO
gap, vertical ionization potentials are obtained and com-
pared with experiments. The main theoretical results can
be summarized in the following points:

(1) The structures of small silver clusters is determined
by s electrons and similar to those of alkali-metal clusters.
The contribution of d electrons to cluster bonding become
more important as cluster size exceed 10 atoms. The
icosahedral growth pattern starts in the Agn with n ≥ 11,
which can be identiﬁed as “atomic order” clusters like
noble gas clusters.

(2) The electronic and geometrical shell structure coex-
ist in silver clusters and take eﬀect in the clusters simul-
taneously. The electronic shell eﬀect on cluster electronic
properties has been found by present TB calculation, in
which the eﬀect of geometrical structures and d electrons
are directly incorporated. The silver clusters with closed
electronic shell (n =2, 8, 14, 18, 20) show more pro-

8

nounced electronic characteristics while the geometrical
eﬀect is enhanced as the icosahedral shell completes at
Ag13.

(3) Due to the pair occupation of s valence electrons
on molecular orbitals, silver clusters show even-odd al-
ternation in their relative stability, HOMO-LUMO gap,
ionization potential. However, the even-odd eﬀects can
be disturbed by the sd overlap or the geometrical struc-
tures of clusters.

(4) The density of electronic states of smaller silver
cluster, e.g., n < 10, is composed by discrete sp expanded
band and a narrow d band. The bulk-like feature in DOS
start at around Ag13 and the bulk limit can be roughly
reached by n = 55.

The present study shows that both the geometrical and
electronic eﬀects should be considered in order to achieve
a complete description of coinage clusters. Therefore, ab
initio molecular dynamics or TBMD are essential to elu-
cidate the interplay between geometrical and electronic
structures of these clusters. The further works should
include the larger clusters and extend the TB model to
other transition metal elements.

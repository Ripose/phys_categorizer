Abstract

Magic numbers predicted by a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator with uq(3)
⊃ soq(3) symmetry are compared to experimental data for atomic clusters of alkali metals
(Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au), divalent metals (Zn, Cd), and trivalent
metals (Al, In), as well as to theoretical predictions of jellium models, Woods–Saxon and
wine bottle potentials, and to the classiﬁcation scheme using the 3n + l pseudo quantum
In alkali metal clusters and noble metal clusters the 3-dimensional q-deformed
number.
harmonic oscillator correctly predicts all experimentally observed magic numbers up to 1500
(which is the expected limit of validity for theories based on the ﬁlling of electronic shells),
while in addition it gives satisfactory results for the magic numbers of clusters of divalent
metals and trivalent metals, thus indicating that uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension
of the u(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic oscillator, is a
good candidate for being the symmetry of systems of several metal clusters. The Taylor
expansions of angular momentum dependent potentials approximately producing the same
spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator are found to be similar to
the Taylor expansions of the symmetrized Woods–Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized
Woods–Saxon potentials, which are known to provide successful ﬁts of the Ekardt potentials.

1. Introduction
Metal clusters have been recently the subject of many investigations (see [1, 2, 3, 4] for
relevant reviews). One of the ﬁrst fascinating ﬁndings in their study was the appearance
of magic numbers, analogous to but diﬀerent from the magic numbers appearing in the
shell structure of atomic nuclei [5]. Diﬀerent kinds of metallic clusters [alkali metals (Na
[6, 7, 8, 9], Li [10, 11], K [12], Rb [13], Cs [7, 14, 15]), noble metals (Cu [16, 17], Ag
[16, 18], Au [16]), divalent metals of the IIB group (Zn, Cd) [19], trivalent metals of the
III group (Al, In) [20]] exhibit diﬀerent sets of magic numbers. The analogy between the
magic numbers observed in metal clusters and the magic numbers observed in atomic nuclei
led to the early description of metal clusters in terms of the Nilsson–Clemenger model [21],
which is a simpliﬁed version of the Nilsson model [22, 23] of atomic nuclei, in which no spin-
orbit interaction is included. Further theoretical investigations in terms of the jellium model
[24, 25] demonstrated that the mean ﬁeld potential in the case of simple metal clusters bears
great similarities to the Woods–Saxon potential of atomic nuclei, with a slight modiﬁcation
of the “wine bottle” type [26, 27]. The Woods–Saxon potential itself looks like a harmonic
oscillator truncated at a certain energy value and ﬂattened at the bottom. It should also be
recalled that an early schematic explanation of the magic numbers of metallic clusters has
been given in terms of a scheme intermediate between the level scheme of the 3-dimensional
harmonic oscillator and the square well [1]. Again in this case the intermediate potential
resembles a harmonic oscillator ﬂattened at the bottom.

On the other hand, modiﬁed versions of harmonic oscillators [28, 29] have been recently
investigated in the novel mathematical framework of quantum algebras [30, 31], which are
nonlinear generalizations of the usual Lie algebras. The spectra of q-deformed oscillators
increase either less rapidly (for q being a phase factor, i.e. q = eiτ with τ being real) or
more rapidly (for q being real, i.e. q = eτ with τ being real) in comparison to the equidis-
tant spectrum of the usual harmonic oscillator [32], while the corresponding (equivalent
within the limits of perturbation theory or WKB-equivalent) potentials [33, 34] resemble
the harmonic oscillator potential, truncated at a certain energy (for q being a phase factor)
or not (for q being real), the deformation inﬂicting an overall widening or narrowing of the
potential, depending on the value of the deformation parameter q.

Very recently, a q-deformed version of the 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator has been
constructed [35], taking advantage of the uq(3) ⊃ soq(3) symmetry [36, 37]. The spectrum of
this 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator has been found [35] to reproduce very well
the spectrum of the modiﬁed harmonic oscillator introduced by Nilsson [22, 23], without
the spin-orbit interaction term. Since the Nilsson model without the spin orbit term is
essentially the Nilsson–Clemenger model used for the description of metallic clusters [21], it
is worth examining if the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator can reproduce the
magic numbers of simple metallic clusters and, in the case that this is possible, to determine
potentials giving the same spectrum as this oscillator and compare them to the symmetrized
Woods–Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized Woods–Saxon potentials, which successfully
ﬁt [26, 27] the Ekardt potentials [24]. These are the subjects of the present investigation.
It is worth mentioning at this point that an eﬀort has been made to describe the magic
numbers of metal clusters by a quantum number 3n + l [6], where n is the number of nodes
in the solution of the radial Schr¨odinger equation and l is the angular momentum quantum
number. This approach has been inspired by the fact that degenerate energy levels in the
hydrogen atom are characterized by the same value of the quantum number n + l, due to

2

the so(4) symmetry underlying this system, while degenerate energy levels in the spherical
harmonic oscillator (i.e. the 3-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator) are characterized
by the same value of the parameter 2n + l, due to the su(3) symmetry underlying this
system. The 3n + l quantum number has been used [6] to approximate the magic numbers
of alkali metal clusters with some success, and focusing potentials characterized by this
degeneracy have been determined [38], but no relevant Lie symmetry could be determined
[38, 39].

In Section 2 the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator will be brieﬂy described,
while in Section 3 the magic numbers provided by this oscillator will be compared with the
experimental data for Na and Li clusters, as well as with the predictions of other theories
(jellium model, Woods–Saxon and “wine bottle” potentials, classiﬁcation scheme using the
3n + l pseudo quantum number). Additional comparisons of magic numbers predicted by
the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator to experimental data and to the results
of other theoretical approaches will be made in Section 4 (for other alkali metal clusters and
noble metal clusters), Section 5 (for divalent group IIB metal clusters), and Section 6 (for
trivalent group III metal clusters), while in Section 7 potentials giving approximately the
same spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator will be determined and
subsequently compared to the symmetrized Woods–Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized
Woods–Saxon potentials. Finally, Section 8 will contain discussion of the present results
and plans for further work.

2. The 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator
The space of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator consists of the com-
pletely symmetric irreducible representations of the quantum algebra uq(3). In this space
a deformed angular momentum algebra, soq(3), can be deﬁned [35]. The Hamiltonian of
the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator is deﬁned so that it satisﬁes the following
requirements:

a) It is an soq(3) scalar, i.e. the energy is simultaneously measurable with the q-deformed

angular momentum related to the algebra soq(3) and its z-projection.

b) It conserves the number of bosons, in terms of which the quantum algebras uq(3) and

c) In the limit q → 1 it is in agreement with the Hamiltonian of the usual 3-dimensional

soq(3) are realized.

harmonic oscillator.

It has been proved [35] that the Hamiltonian of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic

oscillator satisfying the above requirements takes the form

Hq = ¯hω0

where N is the number operator and C (2)

It has been proved [35] that the spectrum of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic os-
cillator closely reproduces the spectrum of the modiﬁed harmonic oscillator of Nilsson. In
both cases the eﬀect of the l(l + 1) term is to ﬂatten the bottom of the harmonic oscillator
potential, thus making it to resemble the Woods–Saxon potential.

The level scheme of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator (for ¯hω0 = 1 and
τ = 0.038) is given in Table 1, up to a certain energy. Each level is characterized by the
quantum numbers n (number of vibrational quanta) and l (angular momentum). Next
to each level its energy, the number of particles it can accommodate (which is equal to
2(2l + 1)) and the total number of particles up to and including this level are given. If the
energy diﬀerence between two successive levels, which we shall denote by δ, is larger than
0.39, it is considered as a gap separating two successive shells and the energy diﬀerence is
reported between the two levels. In this way magic numbers can be easily read in the table:
they are the numbers appearing above the gaps, written in boldface characters.

Additional level schemes of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator are given
in Table 2 (for τ = 0.020 and energy gap δ = 0.20) and in Table 3 (for τ = 0.050 and
energy gap δ = 0.38). The following remarks are now in place:

i) Small magic numbers do not change much as the parameter τ is varied (taking positive
values), while large magic numbers get more inﬂuenced by the parameter modiﬁcation. In
general, the ordering of the levels does not change rapidly with the value of the parameter
τ (for τ > 0).

ii) Rapid change of the magic numbers as a function of τ occurs when τ takes negative

values, but this case is irrelevant to the contents of the present work.

4

iii) Magic numbers are inﬂuenced nore drastically by the value of the energy gap δ. If in
the spectrum obtained for a given value of the parameter τ the energy separation between
two successive levels is only slightly smaller than the energy gap δ, this can be considered
as an indication of the presence of a “secondary” magic number. (See the end of Section 3
for speciﬁc examples.)

3. Sodium and lithium clusters
The magic numbers provided by the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator in
Table 1 are compared to available experimental data for Na clusters [6, 7, 8, 9] and Li
clusters [10, 11] in Table 4 (columns 2–7). Some preliminary results concerning Na clusters
have already been given earlier in Ref. [40]. The following comments apply:

i) Only magic numbers up to 1500 are reported, since it is known that ﬁlling of electronic
shells is expected to occur only up to this limit [6]. For large clusters beyond this point
it is known that magic numbers can be explained by the completion of icosahedral or
cuboctahedral shells of atoms [6].

ii) Up to 600 particles there is consistency among the various experiments and between

the experimental results in one hand and our ﬁndings in the other.

iii) Beyond 600 particles the results of the four experiments, which report magic numbers
in this region, are quite diﬀerent. However, the results of all four experiments are well
accommodated by the present model. In addition, each magic number predicted by the
model is supported by at least one experiment.

In Table 4 the predictions of three simple theoretical models [5] (non-deformed 3-
dimensional harmonic oscillator (column 10), square well potential (column 9), rounded
square well potential (intermediate between the previous two, column 8) ) are also reported
for comparison. It is clear that the predictions of the non-deformed 3-dimensional harmonic
oscillator are in agreement with the experimental data only up to magic number 40, while
the other two models give correctly a few more magic numbers (58, 92, 138), although they
already fail by predicting magic numbers at 68, 70, 106, 112, 156, which are not observed.
It should be noticed at this point that the ﬁrst few magic numbers of alkali clusters
(up to 92) can be correctly reproduced by the assumption of the formation of shells of
atoms instead of shells of delocalized electrons [41], this assumption being applicable under
conditions not favoring delocalization of the valence electrons of alkali atoms.

Comparisons among the present results, experimental data for Na clusters (by Martin
et al. [6] (column 2) and Pedersen et al. [9] (column 3)), experimental data for Li clusters
(Br´echignac et al. [10] (column 4) ), and theoretical predictions more sophisticated than
these reported in Table 4, can be made in Table 5, where magic numbers predicted by
various jellium model calculations (columns 5–8, [6, 7, 2, 42]), Woods–Saxon and wine
bottle potentials (column 9, [43]), as well as by a classiﬁcation scheme using the 3n + l
pseudo quantum number (column 10, [6]) are reported. The following observations can be
made:

i) All magic numbers predicted by the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator are

supported by at least one experiment, with no exception.

ii) Some of the jellium models, as well as the 3n + l classiﬁcation scheme, predict magic
numbers at 186, 540/542, which are not supported by experiment. Some jellium models also
predict a magic number at 748 or 758, again without support from experiment. The Woods–
Saxon and wine bottle potentials of Ref. [43] predict a magic number at 68, for which no
It
experimental support exists. The present scheme avoids problems at these numbers.

5

should be noticed, however, that in the cases of 186 and 542 the energy gap following them
in the present scheme is 0.329 and 0.325 respectively (see Table 1), i.e. quite close to the
threshold of 0.39 which we have considered as the minimum energy gap separating diﬀerent
shells. One could therefore qualitatively remark that 186 and 542 are “built in” the present
scheme as “secondary” (not very pronounced) magic numbers.

4. Other alkali metals and noble metals
Experimental data for various alkali metal clusters [Li ([10], column 2), Na ([6], column
3), K ([12], column 4), Rb ([13], column 5), Cs ([7, 14], column 6)] and noble metal clusters
[Cu ([16], column 7), Ag ([18] in column 8 and [16] in column 9), Au ([16], column 10)] are
reported in Table 6, along with the theoretical predictions of the 3-dimensional q-deformed
harmonic oscillator given in Table 1. The following comments apply:

i) In the cases of Rb [13], Cu [16], Ag [16], Au [16], what is seen experimentally is cations
N , which contain N atoms each, but N − 1 electrons. The

of the type Rb+
magic numbers reported in Table 6 are electron magic numbers in all cases.

N , Au+

N , Cu+

N , Ag+

ii) All alkali metals and noble metals give the same magic numbers, at least within
the ranges reported in the table. For most of these metals the range of experimentally
determined magic numbers is rather limited, with Na [6], Cs [7, 14], Li [10], and Ag [18]
being notable exceptions.

iii) The magic numbers occuring in Na [6], Cs [7, 14], Li [10], and Ag [18] are almost
identical, and are described very well by the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator
of Table 1. The limited data on K, Rb, Cu, Au, also agree with the magic numbers of Table
1.

5. Divalent metals of the IIB group
For these metals the quantities determined experimentally [19] are numbers of atoms
exhibiting “magic” behaviour. Each atom has two valence electrons, therefore the magic
numbers of electrons are twice the magic numbers of atoms. The magic numbers of electrons
for Zn and Cd clusters [19] are reported in Table 7 (in columns 4 and 5 respectively), along
with the magic numbers predicted by the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator for
two diﬀerent parameter values (given in Tables 1 and 2 and reported in columns 1 and 2
respectively), and the magic numbers given by a potential intermediate between the simple
harmonic oscillator and the square well potential ([19], column 3). The following comments
can be made:

i) The experimental magic numbers for Zn and Cd [19] are almost identical. Magic
numbers reported in parentheses are “secondary” magic numbers, while the magic numbers
without parentheses are the “main” ones, as indicated in [1].

ii) In column 1 of Table 7 magic numbers of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic
oscillator with τ = 0.038 and energy gaps larger than 0.26 are reported. Decreasing the
energy gap δ considered as separating diﬀerent shells from 0.39 (used in Table 1) to 0.26
(used in Table 7) has as a result that the numbers 70 and 106 become magic, in close
agreement with the experimental data. Similar but even better results are gotten from the
3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator of Table 2, reported in column 2 of Table
7. This oscillator is characterized by τ = 0.020, while the energy gap δ between diﬀerent
shells is set equal to 0.20 . We observe that the second oscillator predicts an additional
magic number at 112, in agreement with experiment, but otherwise gives the same results
as the ﬁrst one. We remark therefore that the general agreement between the results given
by the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator and the experimental data is not

6

sensitively dependent on the parameter value, but, in contrast, quite diﬀerent parameter
values (τ = 0.038, τ = 0.020) provide quite similar sets of magic numbers (at least in the
region of relatively small magic numbers).

iii) Both oscillators reproduce all the “main” magic numbers of Zn and Cd, while the
intermediate potential between the simple harmonic oscillator and the square well potential,
reported in column 3, reproduces all the “main” magic numbers except 108.

6. Trivalent metals of the III group
Magic numbers of electrons for the trivalent metals Al and In [20] are reported in Table
7 (in columns 7 and 8 respectively), along with the predictions of the 3-dimensional q-
deformed harmonic oscillator of Table 3 (column 6). The following comments can be made:
i) It is known [1, 20] that small magic numbers in clusters of Al and In cannot be
explained by models based on the ﬁlling of electronic shells, because of symmetry breaking
caused by the ionic lattice [20], while for large magic numbers this problem does not exist.
ii) The 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator of Table 3 provides the magic
numbers reported in column 6 of Table 7. These magic numbers agree quite well with the
experimental ﬁndings, with an exception in the region of small magic numbers, where the
model fails to reproduce the magic numbers 164 and 198, predicting only a magic number
at 186. In addition the oscillator predicts magic numbers at 398, 890, 1074, which are not
seen in the experiment reported in column 7.

7. Potentials corresponding to the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic os-

cillator

As we have seen in the previous sections, the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic os-
cillator describes successfully the magic numbers of several metallic clusters. On the other
hand, it is known that metallic clusters are successfully described by the Ekardt potentials
[24] (for which analytical expressions are lacking), which have been recently parametrized in
terms of symmetrized Woods–Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized Woods–Saxon poten-
tials [26, 27] (for which analytical expressions are known). Therefore the following questions
are created:

a) Is it possible to determine some potentials which, when put into the Schr¨odinger
equation, will provide approximately the same spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed
harmonic oscillator?

b) If such potentials can be found, how do they compare with the symmetrized Woods–

Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized Woods–Saxon potentials?

Question a) is a standard problem of inverse scattering [44]. Classical potentials giving
approximately the same spectrum as the one-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator
have been determined either through use of standard perturbation theory [33], or within
the limits of the WKB approximation [34].

In what follows we are going to determine potentials giving approximately the same
spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator by using the method of Ref.
[33], i.e. perturbation theory. According to this method, a potential of the form

V = V0 + κx2 + λx4 + µx6 + ξx8 + · · ·

(8)

corresponds, in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory and keeping terms up to x8 only, to a spec-
trum

E = ǫ0 + κ + 3λ + 15µ + 105ξ + (2κ + 6λ + 40µ + 280ξ)n

7

+ (6λ + 30µ + 350ξ)n2 + (20µ + 140ξ)n3 + 70ξn4.

(9)

The second term in Eq. (8) corresponds to the usual harmonic oscillator. For appropriate
values of the numerical coeﬃcients κ, λ, µ, ξ, the rest of the terms can be considered as
perturbations to the harmonic oscillator.

It is clear that this method can be applied in cases in which the spectrum under study
depends on only one quantum number, the number of excitation quanta n. In the case of
the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator (Eq. (3)), though, the spectrum depends
on an additional quantum number, the angular momentum l. One way out is to determine
a l-dependent equivalent potential, as it is done in several branches of physics [45, 46]. In
order to do this, for each possible value of l (l = n, n − 2, n − 4, . . . 1 or 0 (see Eq. (3))
one determines the energy as a function of n only and then calculates the corresponding
potential.

In the case of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator the energy spectrum
Eq(n, l) for the various possible values of the angular momentum l (l = n, n − 2, n − 4,
. . . 1 or 0) can be put in the form:

Eq(n, n) = ¯hω0[n]q2

l = n,

where by [n]q are denoted the q-numbers of Eq. (2), which are symmetric under the exchange
q ↔ q−1, while by [[n]]q are denoted the q-numbers

which are not symmetric under the exchange q ↔ q−1. For all of these equations it is clear
that they reduce to the classical expression E(n) = ¯hω0n in the limit q → 1.

We then consider the Taylor expansions for these energy expressions. By comparing
them to Eq. (9) and equating the coeﬃcients of the various powers of n (up to n4) we
determine in each case the coeﬃcients κ, λ, µ, ξ. Substituting these coeﬃcients in Eq.

The following comments are now in place:
i) The Taylor expansions of the symmetrized Woods–Saxon and the “wine-bottle” sym-
metrized Woods–Saxon potentials, which have been used for ﬁtting the Ekardt potentials
used for the description of metallic clusters, have the same form as the potentials corre-
sponding to the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator, i.e. they contain all the even
powers of the relevant variable (and no odd powers). It is therefore not surprising that the
3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator gives a good description of the magic numbers
of metallic clusters.

ii) The potentials obtained through the use of perturbation theory are valid near the
origin (x = 0) and for relatively low values of n. They do not give information about the
shape of the potential near its edges, or for very large values of n. The determination of
potentials which will be accurate near their edges remains an open problem.
It should
also be examined if these potentials possess any deeper relation to the quantum algebraic
symmetry characterizing the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator. For example,
one could check if these potentials are related to the generators of the relevant quantum
algebra. The existence of such a relation also remains an open problem.

iii) For very large values of n, the spectrum gets an exponential form. For example, Eq.

(10) becomes (for τ > 0)

Eq(n, n) = ¯hω0

e2τ n − e−2τ n
e2τ − e−2τ

≃ ¯hω0

e2τ n
e2τ − e−2τ .

(31)

Potentials with exponential spectra have been considered in Ref. [47], but also in this case
only the form of the potential near the origin could be determined.

iv) Focusing potentials leading to 3n + l degeneracy of the energy levels (which has
been found to describe reasonably well the magic numbers of alkali clusters [6]) have been
determined in Ref. [38]. They have the form

Both of them are of the form

U3(r) = −

(r/R)4
[(r/R)6 + 1]2 ,

V˜3(r) = E −

(r/Rm)4
[(r/Rm)6 + 1]2 .

V (x) = E − A

x4
(x6 + 1)2 ,

which corresponds to a Taylor expansion of the form

V (x) = E − A(x4 − 2x10 + 3x16 + · · ·).

We remark that this Taylor expansion bears no similarity to the Taylor expansions of the
symmetrized Woods–Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized Woods–Saxon potentials, since
it contains only some of the even powers of the relevant variable and not all of them.
Indeed, these focusing potentials are known to exhibit the “wine-bottle” feature strongly
exaggerated [38], lacking in parallel the ﬂat bottom characterizing the Woods–Saxon and
Ekardt potentials. The potential U3(r) has, however, the major advantage that it reproduces
quite well the edge behaviour of the Ekardt potentials [38].

8. Discussion
The following general remarks can now be made:
i) From the results reported above it is quite clear that the 3-dimensional q-deformed
harmonic oscillator describes very well the magic numbers of alkali metal clusters and noble
metal clusters in all regions, using only one free parameter (q = eτ with τ = 0.038). It
also provides an accurate description of the “main” magic numbers of clusters of divalent
group IIB metals, either with the same parameter value (τ = 0.038) or with a diﬀerent one
(τ = 0.020). In addition it gives a satisfactory description of the magic numbers of clusters
of trivalent group III metals with a diﬀerent parameter value (τ = 0.050).

ii) It is quite remarkable that the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator repro-
duces long sequences of magic numbers (Na, Cs, Li, Ag) at least as accurately as other,
more sophisticated, models by using only one free parameter (q = eτ ). (It should not be
forgotten at this point that these other models have deep physical roots, while the present
approach is based on symmetry arguments, which are justiﬁed a posteriori by their success-
ful predictions.) Once the parameter is ﬁxed, the whole spectrum is ﬁxed and no further
manipulations can be made, the choice of the energy gap δ being the only exception. How-
ever, the choice of the value of the energy gap δ does not inﬂuence the order of the energy
levels, but it is just deciding which energy separations will be considered as corresponding
to main magic numbers and which not. The successful prediction of the magic numbers
can be considered as evidence that the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator owns
a symmetry (the uq(3) ⊃ soq(3) symmetry) appropriate for the description of the physical
systems under study.

11

iii) As we have already mentioned, it has been remarked [6] that if n is the number of
nodes in the solution of the radial Schr¨odinger equation and l is the angular momentum
quantum number, then the degeneracy of energy levels of the hydrogen atom characterized
by the same n + l is due to the so(4) symmetry of this system, while the degeneracy
of energy levels of the spherical harmonic oscillator (i.e. of the 3-dimensional isotropic
harmonic oscillator) characterized by the same 2n + l is due to the su(3) symmetry of
this system. 3n + l has been used [6] to approximate the magic numbers of alkali metal
clusters with some success, and focusing potentials characterized by this degeneracy have
been determined [38], but no relevant Lie symmetry could be determined [38, 39]. In view of
the present ﬁndings the lack of Lie symmetry related to 3n + l is quite clear: the symmetry
of the system appears to be a quantum algebraic symmetry (uq(3)), which is a nonlinear
extension of the Lie symmetry u(3).

iv) The ability of the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator to reproduce cor-
rectly the magic numbers of several metal clusters is not coming as a surprise, if one con-
siders potentials giving approximately (within the limits of perturbation theory) the same
spectrum as this oscillator. The Taylor expansions of these potentials have the same form
as the Taylor expansions of the symmetrized Woods–Saxon and “wine-bottle” symmetrized
Woods–Saxon potentials, which successfully ﬁt [26, 27] the Ekardt potentials [24], which
characterize the structure of metal clusters.

In summary, we have shown that the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator with
uq(3) ⊃ soq(3) symmetry correctly predicts all experimentally observed magic numbers
of alkali metal clusters and of noble metal clusters up to 1500, which is the expected
limit of validity for theories based on the ﬁlling of electronic shells. In addition it gives
a good description of the “main” magic numbers of group IIB (divalent) metal clusters,
as well as a satisfactory description of group III (trivalent) metal clusters. This indicates
that uq(3), which is a nonlinear deformation of the u(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-
dimensional isotropic) harmonic oscillator, is a good candidate for being the symmetry of
systems of several metal clusters. Furthermore, the Taylor expansions of potentials giving
approximately the same spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator are
found to have the same form as the Taylor expansions of the symmetrized Woods–Saxon
and “wine-bottle” symmetrized Woods–Saxon potentials, which sucsessfully ﬁt the Ekardt
potentials underlying the structure of metal clusters. Naturally, these Taylor expansions
are valid near the origin. The determination of potentials which will be accurate near their
edges remains an open problem. It is also an open problem the existence of any deeper
relation between these potentials and the quantum algebra characterizing the 3-dimensional
q-deformed harmonic oscillator, as, for example, some relation between these potentials and
the generators of the quantum algebra.

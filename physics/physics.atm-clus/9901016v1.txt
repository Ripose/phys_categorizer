Abstract

We discuss the degree of anharmonicity of dipole plasmon resonances in

metal clusters. We employ the time-dependent variational principle and show

that the relative shift of the second phonon scales as N −4/3 in energy, N

being the number of particles. This scaling property coincides with that

for nuclear giant resonances. Contrary to the previous study based on the

boson-expansion method, the deviation from the harmonic limit is found to

be almost negligible for Na clusters, the result being consistent with the recent

experimental observation.

Collective phonon excitations are common phenomena in fermionic many-body systems.

In alkali metal clusters, a very strong dipole plasmon resonances have been observed in the

electromagnetic response, which are interpreted as collective vibrational excitations of an

electron gas against a background ions [1]. These resonances are well described in the random

phase approximation (RPA) as a particle-hole excitaion, which assumes the harmonic nature

of the vibrations [2]. It may thus be a natural idea to expect the existence of multiple plasmon

excitations. It is worth mentioning that double phonon excitations have been observed in a

similar phenomenon in nuclear physics, i.e. giant dipole resonance [3,4].

One interesting question is whether the dipole plasmon resonance in metal clusters is

harmonic enough to allow multiple excitations. Catara et al. used the boson-expansion

method to discuss two-plasmon excitations in metal clusters [5]. They claimed that an-

harmonic eﬀects are quite large. On the other hand, a comparison between a jellium-RPA

calculation and the result of time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) [6] sug-

gests that the anharmonic eﬀects are very small for Na clusters. Recently an experiment was

performed which addresses the anharmonic properties of plasmon resonances of alkali metal

clusters [7]. In this experiment, a large intensity of doubly and triply charged fragments

were obserbed in the charge distribution of photofragment of Na+

93. The ionization energy

of this cluster lies between the energy of single and double plasmon resonances, and the

photon energy was set to be slightly larger than the one plasmon energy. The ionization

was thus energetically possible only if at least two photon are absorbed. The observed ion-

ization was interpreted as electron emission via multiple plasmon states, suggesting a very

small anharmonicity, which does not support the prediction by Catara et al. This picture

was later conﬁrmed theoretically, although a signiﬁcant correction from a direct two photon

absorbtion was reported [8].

The aim of this paper is to show that the anharmonic eﬀects are indeed very small for

the dipole plasmon resonance in metal clusters, contrary to the prediction by Catara et al.

To this end, we apply the variational principle for the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation.

The time-dependent variational principle was recently applied to large amplitude collective

2

motions to discuss anharmonic properties of nuclear giant resonances [9]. Its applicability

has been tested on a solvable model in Ref. [10]. The time-dependent variational approach

allows one to estimate relatively easily the energy shift of double phonon state with an

analytic formula. As we will see, it has the same scaling law concerning the number of

particle for both nuclear and cluster cases, although the range of the interaction is very

diﬀerent for these two systems.

Consider a system where N electrons interact with each other in a positively charged

ionic background whose density is given by ρI (r). The Hamiltonian for this system is given

by

In order to ﬁnd the phonon frequency, we requantise these equations of motion with a

respectively. For the dipole ﬁeld (5), the inertia is easily evaluated to be M(β) = mN. After

dropping the constant term, the collective potential is calculated as

ρ0 being the ground state density. To derive Eq. (14), we have used the transformation

(15)

for the dipole ﬁeld, and the fact that both the kinetic energy and the Coulomb interaction

among the electrons in the Hamiltonian (1) are translational invariant [11]. Since we are

interested in the leading order correction to the harmonic limit, we expand the ground state

density in Eq. (14) in terms of β. Accordingly, we express the collective potential as

The linear term in the expansion vanishes because of the stability of the ground state, and

the third order term drops if the spherical symmetry is assumed for the ground state density.

respectively. Here we have assumed that the ionic density ρI has the spherical symmetry.

The expression for k, Eq. (17), was ﬁrst derived by Brack in the context of the sum rule

approach [11,12].

Equations (17) and (18) are general expressions and valid for any form of the ionic and

the electronic density distributions, as long as they are spherical. In order to get a more

transparent formula, we further simplify them by using the jellium approximation. Here the

ionic charge density is uniform in a sphere of radius R = rsN 1/3, where rs is the Wigner-Seitz

radius. We thus assume

where θ is the theta function. Substituting Eq. (19) to Eqs. (17) and (18), we obtain

Here we have neglected the eﬀect of spillout of the electron density outside the ionic back-

electronic density by the error function as [13]

where a is the surface diﬀuseness parameter for the electronic density. Substituting this

density to Eq. (21), we ﬁnally obtain

We now requantise the collective Hamiltonian

and obtain the phonon frequency. The

frequency in the harmonic limit is given by

which coincides with the Mie frequency. The leading correction to the harmonic limit is

given by [9,10]

Note that the dependence of ∆(2)E/ω0 on N is the same as that for the nuclear giant

resonances [9]. Expressing it as a dependence of the volume of the system N

L3, it is

also the same as that for the photon spectrum in a small cavity [10]. All of them scale as

N −4/3

L−4.

Let us now estimate numerically the shift of the frequency for Na clusters. Using the

Wigner-Seits radius of rs = 4 a.u., the Mie frequency (24) is evaluated as ω0 =3.39 eV.

Bertsch and Eckardt ﬁtted the electronic density obtained by a self-consistent local density

approximation by Eq. (22) and obtained a =2.14 a.u.

for N = 198 [13]. Assuming that

the surface diﬀuseness a has a very weak dependense of N, the energy shift of the double

phonon state (26) is estimated as

∆(2)E =

which is extremely small compared with the phonon frequency ω0 in the harmonic limit.

For example, it is as small as

10−3 eV for N=92. This result is consistent with the

recent experimental observation [7] that multiple dipole resonances are easily accessible for

Na clusters.

In summary, we applied the time-dependent variational principle to the dipole plasmon

resonance of alkali metal clusters to discuss its anharmonic properties. The uniform jellium

approximation for the ionic density as well as the error function approximation for the

electronic density lead to a simple analytic expression for the energy shift of the double

phonon state. We found that the ratio of this quantity to the frequency in the harmonic

limit scales as N −4/3, which coincides with that for both nuclear giant resonances and for the

photon spectrum in a small cavity. For Na clusters, we found that the anharmonic eﬀects

are almost negligible, which is consistent with both the previous TDLDA calculation and

the recent experimental suggestion.

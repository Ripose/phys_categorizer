This work is devoted to the elucidation the applicability of jellium model to the

description of alkali cluster properties on the basis of comparison the jellium model

results with those derived from experiment and within ab initio theoretical frame-

work. On the basis of the Hartree-Fock and local-density approximation deformed

jellium model we have calculated the binding energies per atom, ionization poten-

tials, deformation parameters and the optimized values of the Wigner-Seitz radii

for neutral and singly charged sodium clusters with the number of atoms N ≤ 20.

These characteristics are compared with the results derived from the ab initio all-

electron simulations of cluster electronic and ionic structure based on the density

functional theory as well as on the post Hartree-Fock perturbation theory on many-

electron correlation interaction. The comparison performed demonstrates the great

role of cluster shape deformations in the formation cluster properties and the quite

reasonable level of applicability of the deformed jellium model.

INTRODUCTION

2

During the last decade, investigation of the detailed structure and properties of small

sodium clusters attracted a lot of attention (see, e.g., [1, 2, 3] and references therein), be-

cause namely the sodium clusters were used in such important experimental work as the

discovery of metal cluster electron shell structure [4] and the observation of plasmon reso-

nances [5, 6, 7]. These experiments were deﬁnitely among those, which clearly demonstrated

that atomic clusters and small nanoparticles are in fact new physical objects possessing

their own properties. The novelty of cluster physics is also greatly connected with the

fact that cluster properties explain the transition from single atoms or molecules to solid

state. Comprehensive survey of the ﬁeld can be found in review papers and books, see, e.g.,

[1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

With the discovery of electronic shell structure in free alkali clusters [4, 13] the essential

role of the quantized motion of delocalized valence electrons in the mean ﬁeld created by

ions in a cluster has been understood. Under diﬀerent experimental conditions, the detailed

ionic structure has been found not to aﬀect the properties of alkali and other simple metal

clusters very much (see, e.g., [8, 9, 10] for review). This behavior suggests the validity of

a jellium model, deﬁned by a Hamiltonian which treats the electrons in the usual quantum

mechanical way, but approximates the ﬁeld of the ionic cores by treating them as a uniform

positively charged background. This naturally leads to a description of the electron density

in terms of single particle wave functions that extend over the entire cluster.

Initially, jellium calculations for metal clusters were based on the density functional for-

malism with the use of pseudopotentials for the description of electron relaxation eﬀects and

lattice structure [14]. Fully self-consistent calculations for spherical jellium metal clusters

have been performed within the framework of the spin-density-functional method [15] and

the Kohn-Sham formalism for the self-consistent determination of electron wave functions

[13, 16]. The Hartree-Fock (HF) scheme for the self-consistent determination of the electron

wave functions of spherical jellium metal clusters was also introduced later in [17, 18].

Shortly after the discovery of electronic shell structure in free alkali clusters [4, 13] it was

realized that the detailed size dependence of ionization potentials and other characteristics

of small metallic clusters can be understood as a consequence of non-spherical cluster shapes

[19] by analogy with the nuclear shell model. Direct evidence for cluster deformation was

3

achieved in experiments on photoabsorption, where splitting of plasmon resonances caused

by cluster deformation was observed (see [8, 9, 10] and references therein).

Kohn-Sham calculations for spherical [13, 16] metal clusters have been generalized for

spheroidal [20, 21] and more general axial shapes [22] of light clusters. Light clusters of

arbitrary shapes have been studied by means of the ”ultimate” jellium model [23, 24]. The

Hartree-Fock approach was generalized for axially deformed cluster systems in [25, 26]. The

existence of the diﬀerent shape isomers were discussed in [22, 24, 27]. It was shown that

the shape of the magic clusters can deviate from the sphere if higher multipole deformations

are taken into account. For example, the magic cluster Na40 is not spherical if octupole

deformations are allowed. This possibility have been pointed out in [28] and conﬁrmed by

the ‘ultimate’ jellium [29] and the Born-Oppenheimer local-spin density molecular dynamics

method [30]. It has been shown that alkali-metal clusters have similar shapes with small

atomic nuclei [31]. This similarity is a universal result of the density-functional theory.

Dynamical jellium model for metal clusters, which treats simultaneously collective vibra-

tional modes (volume vibrations, i.e. breathing, and shape vibrations) of the ionic jellium

background in a cluster, quantized electron motion and interaction between the electronic

and ionic subsystems was developed in [32, 33]. This model allowed the widths of electron

excitations in metal clusters beyond the adiabatic approximation to be described.

The jellium model provides a very useful basis for studying various collision processes,

such as photabsorption [34], photoionization [35, 36], elastic [37, 38] and inelastic scattering

[38, 39, 40, 41], electron attachment [42, 43], photon emission [44, 45], atomic cluster ﬁssion

process [46, 47] and others, involving metal clusters. On the basis of the jellium model one
can develop ab initio many-body theories, such as the random phase approximation with

exchange or the Dyson equation method and eﬀectively solve many-electron correlation

problem even for relatively large cluster systems containing up to 100 atoms or even more.

Review of these methods in their application to the electron scattering of metal clusters one

can ﬁnd in [48]. As elucidated in the papers cited above, many-electron correlations are

quite essential for the correct description of various characteristics of the cluster systems.

Structural properties of small metal clusters have been widely investigated using quantum
chemistry ab initio methods. Here we refer to the papers [3, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56], in

which optimized geometries, binding energies, ionization potentials, electron structure and

electron transport properties of small lithium and sodium clusters have been calculated.

4

In spite of the fact that both jellium model results and results of ab initio frameworks do

exist in literature there have been performed no systematic comparison of the results of the

two diﬀerent theoretical schemes so far. We ﬁll this gap in our present paper and demonstrate

that such a comparison is rather illustrative and explains essential physical aspects of the

formation of various cluster characteristics and properties. Also, we compare the results of

the Hartree-Fock and local-density approximation (LDA) deformed jellium models and on

this basis elucidate the role of many-electron correlation eﬀects in the formation of cluster

deformations.

On the basis of comparison of the jellium model results with those derived within the
ab initio theoretical framework and experiment we elucidate the level of applicability of the

jellium model to the description of alkali cluster properties. For neutral and singly charged

sodium clusters with N ≤ 20, we have calculated on the basis of Hartree-Fock and LDA

deformed jellium model the binding energies per atom, ionization potentials, parameters

of deformation and optimized values of the Wigner-Seitz radii. These characteristics are
compared with the results derived from the ab initio all-electron theoretical framework for

the calculation of the cluster ionic and electronic structure based on the density functional

theory as well as on the post Hartree-Fock perturbation theory on many-electron correlation

interaction. Comparison performed in our work demonstrates the great role of cluster de-

formations in the formation cluster properties and the quite reasonable level of applicability

of the deformed jellium model.

Our paper is organized as follows. In section II, we provide a brief review of theoretical

approaches and methods used in the calculation.
In section III, we present and discuss
jellium and ab initio results and make their comparison. In section IV, we draw a conclusion

to this paper.

We use the atomic system of units ¯h = |e| = me = 1 in this paper.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

In this work we calculate the binding energies per atom, ionization potentials, deformation

parameters and the optimized values of the Wigner-Seitz radii for neutral and singly charged

sodium clusters with N ≤ 20 using the Hartree-Fock and LDA deformed jellium model. The
jellium model results are compared with those derived in [3] on the basis of ab initio all-

electron simulations of the cluster electronic and ionic structure. Below we present a brief

review of the theoretical methods used in our work. Since the main part of calculations have

been done within the framework of the deformed jellium model, we focus in our brief review
on the jellium model approach rather than on the details of the more sophisticated ab initio

methods for which we refer to [3].

A. Two-centered jellium model and cluster shape parameterization

According to the main postulate of the jellium model, the electron motion in a metallic

cluster takes place in the ﬁeld of the uniform positive charge distribution of the ionic back-

ground. Originally, the Hartree-Fock model for metal-cluster electron structure has been

worked out in the framework of spherically symmetric jellium approximation in [17, 18].

It is valid for clusters with closed electronic shells that correspond to magic numbers (8,

20, 34, 40, 58,...). For metal clusters with arbitrary number of valence electrons an open-

shell two-center jellium Hartree-Fock approximation has been developed (see [25, 26, 46]).

The two-centered jellium method treats the quantized electron motion in the ﬁeld of the

spheroidal ionic jellium background, whose principle diameters a and b can be expressed as

R = rsN 1/3 is the radius of an undeformed spherical cluster with N atoms, rs is the Wigner-

Seitz radius, which for the bulk sodium is equal to 4.0. The deformation parameter δ

characterizes the families of the prolate (δ > 0), and the oblate (δ < 0) spheroids of equal

volume Vc = 4πab2/3 = 4πR3/3.

of the corresponding Poisson’s equation:

The electrostatic potential U of the ionic background can be determined from the solution

follows:

describes a uniform distribution of the ions charge density in the volume of the cluster. Here

ρc = Zc/Vc is the ionic charge density inside the cluster, and Zc is the total charge of the

ionic core.

B. Hartree-Fock and LDA formalism

The Hartree-Fock equations can be written out explicitly in the form (see, e.g., [57])

(−∆/2 + U + UHF ) | a > = εa | a > .

(4)

The ﬁrst term here represents the kinetic energy of electron a, and U its attraction to the

cluster core. The Hartree-Fock potential UHF represents the average Coulomb interaction

of electron a with the other electrons in the cluster, including the non-local exchange inter-

action, and εa describes the single electron energy.

According to the density-functional theory, the ground state energy reaches its minimum

as a function of the density of the system at the exact density [58]. A self-consistent method

for calculation of the electronic states of many-electron systems was proposed by Kohn and

Sham [59]. This method leads to the Kohn-Sham LDA self-consistent equations:

(−∆/2 + U + UH + Vxc) | a > = εa | a > .

(5)

Here UH is the Hartree potential, which represents the direct Coulomb interaction of

electron a with other electrons in the cluster, but does not take into account the non-

local exchange eﬀects, while Vxc is the phenomenological density dependent local exchange-

correlation potential. The important feature of the LDA method consist in the fact that it

takes into account many-electron correlations (see, e.g., [60, 61] for review). In the present

work we use the Gunnarsson and Lundqvist model [62] for the LDA electron exchange-

correlation energy density ǫxc, which reads as

ǫxc(ρel(r)) = −

− 0.0333 G (rs(r)/11.4) .

Here rs(r) = (3/4πρel(r))1/3 is a local Wigner-Seitz radius, while ρel(r) is the electron

The Hartree-Fock (4) and LDA (5) equations have been solved in the system of the

prolate spheroidal coordinates [63] as a system of coupled two-dimensional second order

partial diﬀerential equations. The partial diﬀerential equations have been discretized on a

two-dimensional grid and the resulting system of linear equations has been solved numerically

by the successive overrelaxation method [64]. The third dimension, the azimuthal angle has

been treated analytically.

An important characteristic of the cluster, which deﬁnes its stability is the total energy

Etot(N, δ). The total energy depends on the size N of the cluster and its core deformation

δ. The total energy Etot(N, δ) is equal to the sum of the electrostatic energy of the ionic

core Ecore(N, δ) and the energy of the valence electrons Eel(N, δ):

Etot(N, δ) = Ecore(N, δ) + Eel(N, δ).

The electrostatic energy of the cluster ionic core is equal to

Ecore(N, δ) =

ρ(r)U(r)dr.

In the HF approximation, the electronic energy Eel(N, δ) is given by the general expression

where a and b run over all shells. The values F k(a, b) and Gk(a, b) in the Eq. (11) are the

Coulomb and exchange Slater integrals, qa and qb are the occupation numbers for orbitals

a and b, respectively. The Hatree-Fock coeﬃcients c(abk) and d(abk) for the Coulomb and

exchange energy contributions depend on the occupation numbers (see for details [57]).

where the latter term represents the exchange-correlation energy.

C. All-electron ab initio Hartree-Fock and LDA calculations

When performing all-electron ab initio Hartree-Fock or LDA calculations for metal clus-

ters, one has to solve equations which are symbolically the same to the Hartree-Fock (4) and
the Kohn-Sham (5) equations initially written for the jellium model case. In ab initio calcu-

lations, instead of using the spheroidal jellium parameterization (3) for the distribution of

the ionic charge density and solving the equations only for the valence electrons, one has to

deal with the exact Coulomb forces of all the ions and to solve equations (4) or (5) assuming

that all electrons are present in the system. The explicit form of the exchange-correlation

density functional in equations (5) can be chosen diﬀerently. There are many diﬀerent func-
tional forms, although there is no unique one. For example in [3], the ab initio results have

been obtained with the use of the gradient-corrected Becke-type three-parameter exchange

functional [65] paired with the gradient-corrected Lee, Yang and Parr correlation functional

(B3LYP) [60, 66]. The post Hartree-Fock theories accounting for many-electron correlations,

such as for example the Møller-Plesset perturbation theory of the fourth order (MP4) [67]

have also been used in [3] for metal cluster simulations.

In this paper we do not present the explicit forms of these functionals and omit the

discussion of the methods used for the solution of the Hartree-Fock and LDA equations
in the ab initio framework.

Instead, we refer to the papers, where these functionals and

methods are presented (see, e.g., [3, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71] and references therein).

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section we present the results of systematic numerical calculations performed for

the small sodium clusters in the size range N ≤ 20 on the basis of deformed Hartree-Fock

and LDA jellium model. We determine the binding energies per atom, ionization potentials

9

and cluster deformations. These Hartree-Fock and LDA results are compared with each
other, with the available experimental data, and with the results derived from the ab initio

theoretical framework. This comparison elucidates the important role of many-electron

correlations in metal clusters and establishes the level of applicability of the deformed jellium

model.

A. Total cluster energy minimization

In the Hartree-Fock and LDA jellium models the total cluster energy (11) and (12)

depends on the deformation parameter δ introduced in (1).

Varying the total cluster energy on δ one can ﬁnd its minimum at certain δ for each

electron conﬁguration considered. This value of δ corresponds to the stable geometrical

In ﬁgures 1 and 2 we present the total cluster energy per atom Etot(N, δ)/N calculated

as a function of deformation parameter δ for the neutral and singly charged sodium clusters

conﬁguration of the cluster.

in the size range N ≤ 20.

Solid lines in ﬁgures 1 and 2 present Etot(N, δ)/N for those electronic conﬁgurations

of clusters, that result in the absolute minimum of the total cluster energy. The δ-value

corresponding to the minimum of Etot(N, δ)/N characterizes the cluster shape at the equi-

librium point. Dashed curves show Etot(N, δ)/N for the electronic conﬁgurations providing

the energy minimum the most closely located to the absolute minimum of the total energy.

These ﬁgures demonstrate that for many clusters with open electron shells both oblate and

prolate isomers are possible and have close energies. The type of deformation that develops

in the cluster is determined by the type of the corresponding electronic conﬁguration. If

the electronic orbitals characterizing the chosen electronic conﬁguration are alongated with

respect to the cluster axis of symmetry then the prolate deformation of the ionic jellium

background is preferable. In the opposite case, when electronic orbitals lay mostly at the

plane perpendicular to the cluster axis of symmetry the oblate deformation of the cluster

becomes energetically more favorable.

It is interesting that the deformed jellium model predicts the existence of a non-spherical

isomer for the Na20 magic cluster. So for Na20, the second minimum in Etot(N, δ)/N

arises at δ ≈ 0.37, while the electronic conﬁguration keeps the same. In spite of the fact

linked icosahedrons) with the close energies. The pyramid cluster isomer possesses the

tetrahedral group of symmetry, which is rather high. Thus, this isomer is analogous to the

spherical cluster in the jellium picture. The deformed icosahedral structure corresponds

to the prolate jellium cluster conﬁguration. This correspondence would probably be even

better if one allows the tri-axial deformations in the jellium approach.

The physical reason for the non-monotonous behaviour of the total energy Etot(N, δ)/N

with increasing the deformation parameter δ is the strong mixing of the highest occupied 4σ

state with the unoccupied 5σ state. These levels exhibit a rather peculiar behaviour with the

deformation parameter δ avoiding each other at δ ≈ 0.37. Such an avoided crossing-point is

linked to the Wigner’s no-crossing theorem [72], which states that two energy levels of the

same symmetry cannot cross. Thus, the strong interaction of the 4σ state with the more

prolate type 5σ state results in the appearance of the second minima at δ ≈ 0.37 for Na20

cluster.

Figure 2 demonstrates that similar behaviour of the total energy upon deformation pa-

rameter observe for singly charged cluster ions. This ﬁgure shows that in the jellium ap-
9 and Na+

21, have the spherical shape, δ = 0, at the

proach the closed shell cluster ions, Na+

equilibrium point, similarly to the neutral magic clusters Na8 and Na20.

B. Cluster deformations

In the axially deformed jellium model clusters can either be spherical or have a shape of

ellipsoid of revolution (spheroid). The spheroidal shape can be of the two types prolate or
oblate, depending on the sign of the deformation parameter δ introduced in (1). In the ab
intio approach, the cluster shape is determined by the optimized coordinates of all the ions

and it can be characterized by the tensor Rij

Rij =

xixj

X

(13)

Here, the summation is performed over all ions in the system. The principle values of this

tensor Rxx, Ryy and Rzz deﬁne the dimensions Rx, Ry and Rz of the ionic charge distribution

13

in the cluster along the principle axes x, y and z. Note that tensor Rij is closely connected

with the cluster moment of inertia tensor and the quadrupole moment tensor of the ionic

distribution.

The tensor Rij can also be deﬁned for the jellium model. In this case, sum in (13) should

be replaced by the integral and the integration to be performed over the homogeneous

spheroidal distribution of the ionic density in the cluster. Then, the principal values of the

tensor Rij can easily be determined. The result of this calculation reads as

Rxx = Ryy =

N,

Rzz =

N.

Here, a and b are the principle diameters of the spheroid deﬁned in (1).

In ﬁgure 3, we present the principle values Rxx, Ryy and Rzz calculated for the neutral

sodium clusters with N < 20 in the framework of the deformed jellium model according to

(14). The diameters a and b have been determined by minimizing the total cluster energy

in the LDA approximation (12) as explained in the previous subsection. This calculation

has been performed with rs = 4.0 (Fig. 3a), which corresponds to the density of the bulk

sodium, and with optimized value of the Wigner-Seitz radius (Fig. 3b). The cluster energy

minimization on Wiger-Seitz radius will be discussed in section III F in more detail. The

LDA deformed jellium model results are shown in ﬁgure 3 by the ﬁlled triangles. The ﬁlled

triangles pointing up correspond to Rxx=Ryy, while those pointing down to Rzz. The opened
triangles are the results of the all-electron ab initio framework derived in [3] with the use

of the B3LYP density functional. The opened triangles pointing up and down show Rxx

and Rzz respectively, while the opened triangles pointing right represent Ryy. In ﬁgure 4 we

present the results of similar calculations performed for singly charged ions. The notations

used in ﬁgure 4 are the same as in ﬁgure 3.

Comparison of the results presented in ﬁgures 3 and 4, demonstrate that the optimization

of the cluster energy on the Wigner-Seitz radius does not change much the neutral cluster

geometries. For cluster ions, the alteration of the cluster shape with the variation of the

Wigner-Seitz radius is more noticeable, although it does not improve the agreement of the
jellium model and ab initio results. This comparison demonstrates that the Wigner-Seitz

radius variation in the jellium model does not actually improve the quality of the model.

Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate rather good agreement of the jellium model and ab initio

results. In most of the cases the jellium model predicts correctly the type of the dominant
cluster deformation, prolate or oblate one. Of course, ab initio calculations include tri-axial

deformations of the cluster, which turned out to be noticeable for the clusters with the
13, Na+
open subshells and play important role for clusters like Na12 − Na14, Na17, Na+
14,
Na+
20. The axially symmetric deformed jellium model does not take into account tri-axial

deformations and thus in this case always Rxx = Ryy.

The axially symmetric jellium model gives the wrong type of deformation in the open

shell clusters, like Na5, Na16 − Na19, Na+

6 , Na+
that for all these clusters there are almost degenerate oblate and prolate isomers within the

20. However, it is necessary to note

17 − Na+

axially symmetric jellium model, as it is shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2 and in tables I and II (see

Appendix). Thus, accounting for tri-axial deformations in these clusters plays the crucial
role as it becomes clear from the comparison of the jellium and ab initio results.

For the magic clusters Na8 and Na20, the principle values Rxx = Ryy = Rzz are almost
identical in both approaches, which demonstrates the closeness to the sphericity of the ab
initio magic cluster shapes. Note that for the magic cluster ion, Na+
9 , some small defor-
mation remains in the ab initio approach, while in the jellium approach it turns out to be

spherical. This demonstrates that the ionic framework of the cluster is not that deformable

as it follows from the jellium model.

In Appendix, we compiled in tables the optimized Wigner-Seitz radii rs, total energies per

atom Etot(N, δ)/N, deformation parameters δ and the second derivatives of the total energy

on cluster deformation at the δ-point corresponding to minimum of the total energy. The

later characteristic of the cluster, ∂2Etot(N, δ)/∂δ2, is directly connected to the frequency

of cluster surface vibrations (see, e.g., [33] for details). All values which are presented in

the tables I and II have been calculated in the LDA deformed jellium model for neutral and

singly charged clusters.

C. Binding energies per atom

In this paper we calculate the dependence of binding energy per atom in the deformed
jellium model and compare it with ab initio results from [3]. The binding energies per atom

17

(15)

(16)

for the neutral and singly charged clusters are deﬁned as follows:

Eb/N = E1 − EN /N

E+

b /N =

(N − 1)E1 + E+

1 − E+
N

/N,

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where EN and E+

N are the total energies of a neutral and singly-charged N-atomic jellium

cluster respectively.

Figure 5 shows the dependence of the binding energy per atom for neutral (Fig. 5a) and

singly charged (Fig. 5b) clusters as a function of cluster size calculated in the deformed
jellium model. We compare the calculated dependences with the ab initio results from [3]

obtained by the B3LYP and MP4 methods. In ﬁgure 5 we show the jellium model results

obtained with bulk and optimized values of the Wigner-Seitz radius.

It is seen that the

cluster optimization on the Wigner-Seitz radius brings the cluster energies down and makes
them closer to the ab initio results.

Figure 5 demonstrates that the general trend of the curves calculated within the jellium
framework turns out to be very close to the one obtained from the ab initio calculation.
The similarity of the the jellium and ab initio curves is higher for N ≤ 10. In the region

10 ≤ N ≤ 20 small discrepancy in the behaviour of the curves can be attributed to the
tri-axial cluster deformations taken into account in the ab initio approach and omitted in

the axially symmetric jellium model.

Note that the jellium model results for both neutral and singly charged sodium clusters

are somewhat closer to the predictions of the MP 4 method. This method is based on the

accounting of the many-electron correlations up to the fourth order of the perturbation

theory and is free of any adjustable parameters.

Figure 5 demonstrates that in spite of the simplicity, the jellium model turns out to be

rather reliable approximation able to reproduce reasonably well the dependence of binding

energy per atom for both neutral and singly charged sodium clusters.

D. On the role of exchange and many electron correlation interaction.

To illustrate the importance of the exchange and many-electron correlation interaction in

the cluster, we plot on ﬁgure 6 the total energy per atom calculated both in the HF and LDA

spherical jellium approximations for neutral (Fig. 6a) and singly charged (Fig. 6b) spherical

sodium clusters as a function of cluster size. The spherical cluster shape was assumed in

this calculation for the sake of simplicity. Figure 6 shows the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between

the HF and LDA results for both neutral and singly charged clusters, which is the result of

the accounting for the many-electron correlation interaction within LDA.

Figure 6 demonstrates that the LDA total energy dependence possesses the local minima

at the shell closings N = 2, 8, 20 for neutral clusters and N = 3, 9, 21 for singly charged ones.

The HF total energy curve has the extra minima at the half-shell closings, i.e. N = 5, 13, 19

for neutral clusters and N = 6, 14, 20 for singly charged cluster ions. The appearance of

these extra minima is the result of the more accurate accounting for the exchange interaction

within the HF approximation. We found that with increasing cluster size within the given

shell the favorable electronic conﬁguration of the cluster changes resulting in the formation

of the extra minima on the HF total energy dependence. Qualitatively, this situation can be

understood on the basis of the Hund’s rule which states that the lowest energy level in the

system at a ﬁxed electronic conﬁguration is characterized by the maximum value of total

spin and the maximum possible (at this spin) angular momentum. As an illustration, ﬁgure

7 shows the δ-dependencies of the total energy per atom for Na5 cluster obtained in the

Hartree-Fock (Fig. 7a) and LDA (Fig. 7b) deformed jellium model for diﬀerent electronic

conﬁgurations. Figure 7a clearly demonstrates that the extra minima on HF total energy

curve correspond to the electronic states in which spins of all the electrons from the open

shell are parallel. The LDA framework, with the exchange-correlation potential (9), which

we have used in our work does not take into account the spin polarization eﬀects and thus

we found no minima on the LDA total energy curve at closing of the half ﬁlled shells (see

Fig. 7b).

It is equal to:

E.

Ionization potentials

Another important characteristic of the cluster system is its ionization potential. The

ionization potential is determined by the energy needed to take an electron out of the cluster.

FIG. 8:

Ionization potentials of neutral sodium clusters calculated in the deformed jellium model

and compared with ab initio results from [3] and with experiment [8].

In ﬁgure 8, we present the ionization potential of neutral sodium clusters calculated

within the jellium model as a function of cluster size. We compare the jellium model results
with those obtained in [3] using ab initio theoretical framework and with the available

experimental data [8]. This comparison demonstrates that the jellium model reproduces

correctly most of the essential features of the ionization potential dependence on N. Some

discrepancy, like in the region 11 ≤ N ≤ 14, can be attributed to the neglection of the

tri-axial deformation in the axially symmetric jellium model.

In spite of the fact that ab initio results are closer to the experimental points, one can

state quite satisfactory agreement of the jellium model results with the experimental data,

which illustrates correctness of the jellium model assumptions and its applicability to the

description of sodium clusters.

Figure 8 also demonstrates the role of cluster deformations on the formation of the odd-

even oscillations in the dependence of the cluster ionization potential on N.

Indeed, for

spherically symmetric clusters this dependence turns out to be monotonous within the range

23

of the given shell [34] contrary to the experimental observations. Allowing for the cluster

deformation and introducing a single deformation parameter δ, we have achieved much better

agreement of theoretical results with the experimental data as it is clear from ﬁgure 8.

F. Wigner-Seitz radius variation

Calculations of the cluster total energy are usually performed at the certain value of the

Wigner-Seitz radius rs. The bulk value of the Wigner-Seitz radius for sodium is equal to

4.0. However, one can also perform the calculation minimizing the total cluster energy by

variation of the Wigner-Seitz radius.

Figure 9 demonstrates the dependence of the optimized Wigner-Seitz radii on cluster

size calculated for neutral and singly charged sodium clusters within the HF and LDA

approximations. This ﬁgure shows that the alteration of the optimized rs values is much

larger for the cluster ions as compared to the neutral clusters. For neutral clusters, the

optimized values are somewhat larger than the bulk value rs = 4.0 in both LDA and HF

approximations. The LDA dependence goes closer to the bulk limit. With increasing N

this dependence approaches the bulk limit, being very close to it also for the magic numbers

N = 8 and N = 20, which is another manifestation of the shell eﬀect.

The diﬀerence between the optimized values of the Wigner-Seitz radii obtained in the

HF and LDA approximations can be atributed to the manifestation of the many-electron

correlation interaction in the system. To illustrate this fact, we plot in ﬁgure 10 the diﬀerence

between the optimized Wigner-Seitz radii calculated in the LDA and HF approximations

for neutral and singly charged sodium clusters. These dependences have the prominent

peculiarities. The origin of these peculiarities is the same as for those in ﬁgure 6 (see section

III D and discussion therein), although now we consider deformed cluster systems.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we performed systematic calculation of various characteristics of neutral

and singly charged sodium clusters with N ≤ 20 on the basis of the deformed HF and
LDA jellium models. We compared the results of our calculations with the ab initio results

obtained in [3] and with the available experimental data. From these comparisons, we have

established the level of applicability of the jellium model to the description of various cluster

characteristics.

Our consideration shows that the deformed jellium model provides qualitatively correct

description of the sodium clusters and their ions. The quantitatively reliable results with

the accuracy below than 10 per cent one can expect from the jellium model description

providing one allows for the tri-axial cluster deformations.

We have performed our calculations using HF and LDA approximations. Comparison of

the results of the two approaches allowed us to demonstrate the importance of the many-

electron correlations in the formation of cluster characteristics and properties.

We have performed our calculations for sodium clusters. However, most of the conclu-

sions should be applicable to other alkali clusters, potassium for example. The level of

applicability of the jellium approach to other metals, like alkali-earth, requires a separate

careful consideration.

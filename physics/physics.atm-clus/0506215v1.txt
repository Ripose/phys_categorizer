We investigate the heating of the quasi-free electrons in large rare gas clusters (N exceeding
−2). We identify elastic
105 atoms) by short laser pulses at moderate intensities (I ≃ 1015 Wcm
large-angle backscattering of electrons at ionic cores in the presence of a laser ﬁeld as an eﬃcient
heating mechanism resembling the Fermi shuttle.
Its eﬃciency as well as the eﬀect of collective
electron motion, electron-impact ionization and cluster charging, are studied employing a mean-
ﬁeld classical transport simulation. Results for the absolute x-ray yields are in surprisingly good
quantitative agreement with recent experimental results.

The interaction of short and ultra-short intense laser
pulses with clusters has become an important area of
laser-matter research bridging the gap between gas-phase
and solid-state processes [1]. The observation of char-
acteristic x-ray emission from laser-irradiated clusters
[2, 3, 4, 5] suggested its potential as an x-ray source
through a highly non-linear conversion of IR radiation
that combines advantages of both solid and gaseous tar-
gets. Like solids, clusters provide large x-ray yields, yet
unlike solids they are debris-free, just like gaseous tar-
gets. Characteristic x-ray emission also provides impor-
tant time-diﬀerential information on the laser-induced
electronic dynamics on a femtosecond scale. The charge
state as well as the vacancy distribution of the clus-
ter ions at the instant of emission can be extracted
from high-resolution x-ray spectra. Moreover, as the
vacancy production in deeply bound shells (e.g. K-shell
in argon or L-shell in xenon) proceeds via impact ion-
ization by energetic electrons, characteristic x-rays pro-
vide an “in situ” thermometer of the temperature of the
heated electron gas in the cluster. Recent experiments
[3, 4, 5] found an unexpectedly low laser intensity thresh-
old for the production of x-ray radiation. When irra-
diating large argon clusters with N > 105 atoms with
laser pulses with a short pulse duration of τ = 60 fs at
full width half maximum (FWHM), the intensity thresh-
old for the production of characteristic K-x-rays lies at
Ith = 2.2 · 1015 Wcm−2. By comparison, the ponderomo-
tive energy, UP = F 2/(4ω2), of a free electron in a laser
ﬁeld of this intensity is as low as UP ≃ 130 eV, more
than an order of magnitude below the binding energy
EK ≃ 3.2 keV of the K-shell electrons. This observa-
tion raises puzzling questions as to the eﬃcient heating
mechanism for electrons in large clusters at such mod-
erate intensities of very short pulses with ∼ 40 optical
cycles.

Several theoretical models for intense laser-cluster in-
teraction have been proposed [1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], none

of which appears to provide a satisfactory explanation
for such rapid acceleration of electrons. A theoretical de-
scription of intense laser-cluster interaction represents a
considerable challenge in view of the many-body nature
of this process. Molecular dynamic simulations [7, 8, 9]
are limited to about 1000 atoms, and results obtained for
small clusters are diﬃcult to scale to larger sizes. The
recently proposed microscopic particle in cell (MPIC)
method [10] reaches clusters of ∼ 104 atoms. Larger
clusters with N > 105 particles appear still not in reach,
and quantitative predictions for x-ray emission and inner-
shell processes have not yet been attempted. We propose
in this letter an eﬃcient heating mechanism of electrons
in large clusters that is operational within a few optical
cycles and at moderate laser intensities. It is based on the
observation that elastic large-angle scattering of electrons
at cluster atoms (ions) in the simultaneous presence of a
laser ﬁeld provides an eﬃcient route to electron acceler-
ation. Elastic backscattering at the core potential of the

ions can ﬂip the velocity vector of an electron, allowing
it with non-negligible probability to remain synchronized
with the alternating laser ﬁeld vector (Fig. 1). Conse-
quently, the electron will rapidly accumulate rather than
lose momentum during subsequent half cycles. Within
a few optical cycles, electrons can thus be accelerated
to high kinetic energies well beyond the quiver energy
Ep = 2Up. This heating mechanism resembles the Fermi
shuttle acceleration [12, 13] and is also related to the
lucky-electron model proposed for IR photoemission from
metallic surfaces [14]. The acceleration of a particle by
successive backscatterings from a moving and a station-
ary target in the original proposal by Fermi for acceler-
ation of cosmic particles is here modiﬁed such that the
cluster ions represent stationary targets, while the alter-
nating force ﬁeld of the laser plays the role of the mov-
ing target. A realistic estimate for the eﬃciency of this
heating mechanism hinges on a proper description of the
diﬀerential elastic scattering cross sections for electrons,
dσe/dθ, into backward angles θ & 90◦, which are deter-
mined by the non-Coulombic short-ranged potentials of
the ionic cores. dσe/dθ was calculated for electron scat-
tering at argon ions for all relevant charge states between
q = 1 and q = 16 over a wide range of energies using
parametrized Hartree-Fock potentials [17, 18]. dσe/dθ is
typically dominated by few low-order partial waves giv-
ing rise to generalized Ramsauer-Townsend minima [15]
and diﬀraction oscillations [16] (Fig. 2). We assumed
for simplicity the electronic ground state occupation for
each q. Extensions to core-excited conﬁgurations would
be straight forward. For the interstitial region a muﬃn-
tin potential is employed in order to account for solid-
state eﬀects [18]. The potential shape in this region has,
however, no signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the cross sections at
backward angles. The latter exceeds the pure Coulomb
case by several orders of magnitude for all charge states
and over a wide range of electron energies (. keV ). The
frequent usage in simulations of unrealistic (softened)
Coulomb potentials [7, 9, 10], which grossly underesti-
mates backscattering, is quite likely one reason why this
route of electron acceleration has not yet been accounted
for. Moreover, this process becomes much more impor-
tant for large clusters, as the mean-free path for elastic
scattering becomes comparable to the cluster size. The
important role of realistic core potentials has recently
also been identiﬁed in the quantum analogue of this pro-
cess, inverse Bremsstrahlung (UP ≪ ~ω), for clusters in
a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser ﬁeld [19].

A full ab initio simulation for large clusters (N & 105
particles) appears still impractical. In the following we
present a simpliﬁed theoretical description of the elec-
tronic ensemble that allows to tackle its short-time dy-
namics (τ ∼ 60 fs). It employs a generalization of clas-
sical transport theory (CTT [20]) for open systems, in
which the electronic dynamics is represented by a clas-
sical phase-space distribution f (r, ˙r, t) whose evolution

is determined by test-particle discretization, i.e. by solv-
ing the corresponding Langevin equation for represen-
tative trajectories.
In the present case, the ensemble
consists of Ne quasi-free electrons, liberated inside the
cluster after ionization of the cluster atoms, represented
by Ntest = αNe particles, where the scaling parameter α
is limited by computational feasibility. Each test particle
is subject to a Langevin equation (atomic units are used
unless otherwise stated),

tem open to both particle number variation, Ntest(t), due
to successive ionization events, and energy exchange with

ized with a temporal envelope

Eq. (1) provides a computational starting point for treat-
ing many-body collisional correlation eﬀects through
stochastic forces F stoc, which can be determined either
from independent ab-initio quantum calculations or ex-
perimental data [20]. Forces resulting from static conser-
vative potentials V inside the cluster [7], can be included
as well. Because of the coherent motion and high ion-
ization density, the present extension of the CTT (Eq.
1) goes beyond the independent-particle description by
including dynamic electron-electron and electron-ion in-

teractions on a time-dependent mean ﬁeld level. Ac-
cordingly, F mean depends on the entire ensemble of test-
particle coordinates {ri(t)}. We therefore propagate the
elements of the ensemble by self-consistently coupling a
given trajectory to the mean ﬁeld of other trajectories
running in parallel by continuously updating the forces.
Eﬀects of ﬂuctuations on the electronic dynamics can
be taken into account through stochastic forces which
are determined from Poissonian random processes. For
example, electron-ion scattering, electron-impact ioniza-
tion, and core-hole excitation are determined by the
probability per unit pathlength for scattering

controlled by the energy (E) and charge state (q) depen-
dent integral cross-section for this process, σscatt(q, E),
and the instantaneous ionic target density ρ(t) of a given
charge state. Each stochastic scattering process results
in “jumps” (classical trajectory jumps and jumps in oc-
cupation) at discrete times. A jump in momentum, ∆ ˙r,
signiﬁes elastic scattering determined by the diﬀerential
cross section, dσe(q, E, θ)/dθ, a simultaneous jump in
test-particle number, ∆Ntest, represents ionizing colli-
sions, and a simultaneous jump in the number of inner-
shell vacancies, ∆NK, results from core-exciting colli-
sions. The key point is that the necessary input data,
σscatt(q, E), can be determined and tabulated indepen-
dently from the simulation at any desired level of sophis-
tication. In the present simulation, the electron-impact
ionization cross sections are determined from a modiﬁed
Lotz formula [4, 21] σi(q, E) = A∗
q ) (for
E ≥ W ∗
q and W ∗
q ), where the empirical parameters A∗
q
were obtained by a ﬁt to experimental ion-atom collision
data [4, 22]. The cluster-speciﬁc eﬀects of suppression
of the work function can be incorporated by modifying
the eﬀective work function W ∗
q in the presence of nearby
ionic cores.

For the mean ﬁeld we perform a multipole expan-
sion keeping only the monopole and dipole terms. The
monopole term is given by F (0)
mean(~r, t) = hQ(r, t)ir/r3
where hQ(r, t)i is the instantaneous charge of the sphere
of radius r resulting from the displacement of the en-
semble of test particles relative to the ionic background.
Analogously, the dipole ﬁeld inside the cluster (r < R(t))
is F (1)
mean(t) = −p(t)/R(t)3, while outside it is that of a
central dipole. The dipole moment, p is determined by
p(t) ≃ − 1
i ri, where the sum extends over the subset
α
of test particles with ri < R(t).

As the ionic and electronic dynamics proceed on dif-
ferent time scales, the onset of cluster expansion can be
taken into account through the parametric variation of
the radius R(t) of the uniform spherical charge back-
ground representing the ions of mass M in their time-

We solve (Eq. 1) for a cluster with N = 2.8 × 105 ar-
gon atoms with initial atomic number density ρ(t = 0) =
2.66×1022 cm−3 and initial radius R(0) = 258 a.u. irradi-
ated by a laser pulse of length (FWHM) τ = 60 f s, wave-
length λ = 800nm and peak intensities I & 1015 Wcm−2.
The ponderomotive energy of the electrons is of the or-
der of UP & 70 eV ≈ 2.5 a.u. As the laser ﬁeld reaches for
the ﬁrst time the threshold ﬁeld for over-barrier ioniza-
tion F 1
L(t1) ≃ 0.08, the ﬁrst Ntest(t1) test particles with
zero velocity randomly distributed over the cluster pro-
vide initial conditions for the propagation of Eq. (1). In
the present case Ntest = 0.1Ne (or α = 0.1). Contribu-
tions from tunneling ionization can be included but are
in the present case negligible. The test-particle number

subsequently increases by further ionization events (Fig.
3(a)). Impact ionization by electrons meanwhile accel-
erated is highly eﬀective, making further ﬁeld ionization
events unlikely. The mean charge state rapidly increases
to ∼ 7, which most likely still underestimates the ioniza-
tion eﬃciency, as non-radiative core-hole relaxation and
enhanced ionization by suppression of the work function
by ion proximity are not yet included. The Coulomb ex-
pansion of the cluster sets in slowly due to the large iner-
tia of the ions. Even after the laser pulse is switched oﬀ
(t & 2τ ), the cluster has expanded by less than a factor
2. Our simulation shows that the charge resulting from
electrons leaving the cluster (Fig. 3(b)) is concentrated
on the surface of the cluster, the ions in the inside of the
cluster being well shielded by the quasi-free electrons, in
agreement with the MPIC simulation [10]. After the ﬁrst
ionization burst the electronic plasma frequency is given
by ω2
p = Ntest(t1)/(αR(t1)3) = ρ(t1)4π/3 ≃ 0.016 a.u. ≈
5ω2. As electron-impact ionization produces more quasi-
free electrons, ωp grows rapidly before diminishing again
as the cluster expansion sets in (Fig. 3(c)). During the
evolution, the eﬀective ﬁeld inside the cluster consisting
of both the laser and the polarization ﬁeld is approxi-
mately given by

where ∆ω is the Fourier width caused by the temporal
proﬁle of the pulse (Eq. 2) and γ stands for the damp-
ing due to scattering events. Fef f is signiﬁcantly re-
duced compared to the bare laser ﬁeld (Fig. 3(d)) due
to the combined eﬀect of collective electron motion and
electron-impact ionization. A signiﬁcant resonant en-
hancement [6, 9] is absent. Ref. [10] suggested laser de-
phasing heating (LDH), in which the phase shift between
dipole moment and laser ﬁeld caused by the macroscopic
electric ﬁeld inside the cluster, would lead to a net elec-
J F ef f dt, where J stands for
tron energy absorption
the electron current. However, evaluating this integral
using the simulated current and ﬁeld shows that heating
by LDH is not suﬃcient in the present case.

The eﬃciency of heating by elastic electron-ion scatter-
ing is directly reﬂected in the simulated absolute x-ray
yields (Fig. 4). The latter are determined by the num-
ber of K-shell vacancies created, corrected for the mean
ﬂuorescence yield η taken to be η ≈ 0.12 [23] for argon
with partially ﬁlled L-shell but empty M-shell. It should
be emphasized that the simulation contains no freely ad-
justable parameter. To compare the simulation results
to the experiments, an ensemble average over the spatial
intensity proﬁle of the laser beam, which is Gaussian to a
good degree of approximation [4], is performed. To quan-
tify the signiﬁcance of the Fermi-shuttle acceleration by

repeated elastic backscattering, we performed an other-
wise identical simulation with elastic electron-ion scatter-
ing switched oﬀ. In this case, for I & 1.5 × 1015 Wcm−2 a
small fraction of quasi-free electrons gains suﬃcient en-
ergy to produce K-shell vacancies. Their mean kinetic
energy can be estimated from the potential energy of the
charged-up cluster with charge Q(t) (i.e. the monopole
term of the mean eﬀective ﬁeld). However, including elas-
tic electron-ion scattering drastically increases the x-ray
yield by a factor 3 to 6. We then ﬁnd surprisingly close
agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 4).

In summary, we have analyzed the heating of the quasi-
free electrons in large rare-gas clusters (N ∼ 105 atoms)
at moderate laser intensities (I = 1015 − 1016Wcm−2).
We have identiﬁed a novel, highly eﬃcient electron heat-
ing mechanism operative at short times within a few
optical cycles in terms of elastic large-angle scattering
resembling the Fermi shuttle. Other processes such as
heating in a plasma-resonant ﬁeld are found to be less

leads to a reduction rather than an enhancement of the
eﬀective ﬁeld. While the surprisingly good quantitative
agreement on an absolute scale with experimental data
may be, in part, fortuitous, the importance of this route
to fast electron acceleration appears unambiguously es-
tablished.

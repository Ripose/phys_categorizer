We investigate noncollinear eﬀects in antiferromagnetically coupled clusters using the general,
rotationally invariant form of local spin-density theory. The coupling to the electronic degrees of
freedom is treated with relativistic non-local pseudopotentials and the ionic structure is optimized
by Monte-Carlo techniques. We ﬁnd that small chromium clusters (N ≤ 13) strongly favor non-
collinear conﬁgurations of their local magnetic moments due to frustration. This eﬀect is associated
with a signiﬁcantly lower total magnetization of the noncollinear ground states, ameliorating the
disagreement between Stern-Gerlach measurements and previous collinear calculations for Cr12 and
Cr13. Our results further suggest that the trend to noncollinear conﬁgurations might be a feature
common to most antiferromagnetic clusters.

I. INTRODUCTION

Magnetic properties of transition metal clusters have become the subject of intensive research, both from the exper-
imental1–4 and theoretical point of view5–8. One of the most interesting and challenging aspects of that ﬁeld is the
subtle interplay between geometric structure and magnetic ordering which has mostly been investigated for ferromag-
netic 3d-clusters and 4d-clusters. Finite size eﬀects and a reduced dimensionality often lead to a signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
magnetic behavior from the bulk with clusters having enhanced atomic moments9,10, larger anisotropy energies11 or
an altered temperature dependence of the magnetization12.
Almost all theory to date employed the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) with the assumption that the spin
density matrix is diagonal in some particular frame. In that special case the spins are automatically collinear along
a ﬁxed quantization axis. The only generalized spin-density calculation for clusters that treats the electron spin as a
vector observable and a function of position has recently been performed by Car and coworkers.13. They have shown
that noncollinear conﬁgurations exist in Fe3 and Fe5 although the eﬀect on structure and energetics of these ferromag-
netic (FE) clusters is not very pronounced. On the other hand an unconstrained orientation of the quantization axis
is known to play a key role in describing various non-ferromagnetic systems like the γ-phase of bulk iron14, disordered
systems15 or ultra thin Fe ﬁlms with a partial antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling16. Furthermore, the work on Fe/Cr
(ref.17) and Ag/Cr multilayers18 demonstrated how the competition between AF ordering and frustration of the Cr
moments leads to noncollinear arrangements in form of a spin-density wave. Although the importance of frustration
in AF systems seems to be evident and was discussed in detail for embedded Cr clusters by Pastor et al.19 and more
generally by Manninen and coworkers20, the possibility of noncollinear eﬀects has not yet been considered for AF
clusters.

In this paper, we present the ﬁrst general local spin-density calculation for clusters of AF materials. Besides the
motivation given above, we have decided to explore noncollinear eﬀects in chromium clusters for two reasons: First,
chromium is particularly challenging amongst the 3d-elements due to its maximal spin alignment in the atom (3d54s1):
all valence electrons have parallel spins, i.e. the total magnetization is S=3. This leads to a variety of unique eﬀects
including an unusually short dimer bonding length or a repulsion for FE coupling at small distances21,22. The other
reason why we chose chromium is the possibility to compare with the thorough ab-initio study of Cr clusters by
Cheng and Wang23. These authors recently employed the conventional LSDA for Nat ≤ 15, ﬁnding all clusters to be
antiferromagnetically coupled. Their structures can serve as a benchmark to check our computations concerning the
restriction to collinear conﬁgurations – an aspect that is crucial to extract the importance of noncollinear eﬀects.
In Section II we outline the fundamentals of our theoretical approach and brieﬂy motivate the structure optimization.
This involves the rotationally invariant LSDA to minimize the electrons and a relativistic, non-local pseudopotential
In Section III we discuss some numerical tests and present our results. We
for their interaction with the ions.
ﬁnd noncollinear spin-conﬁgurations for all investigated clusters. We demonstrate the inﬂuence of noncollinearity
on the geometry and on the total magnetic moment and discuss how this reduces the discrepancy concerning the
magnetization of some chromium clusters between the experiment by Bloomﬁeld et al.24 and some previous theoretical
results23,25.

II. THEORETICAL AND NUMERICAL BACKGROUND

The density functional theory in its most general form, as developed by Barth and Hedin26, allows the orientation of
each spin to vary with position. The wavefunctions are described by complex two-component spinors Ψ = (Ψσ, Ψσ′ ),
where σ and σ′ denote the spin indices, and the degrees of freedom are the elements of the single-particle spin-density
matrix

ρσσ′ (~r) =

Ψi,σ (~r) Ψ∗

i,σ′ (~r)

.

i
X

Assuming this matrix to be diagonal, the usual local spin-density functionals are parameterized in terms of ρ↑↑(~r) =:
ρ↑(~r) and ρ↓↓(~r) =: ρ↓(~r) only. In that special case, the spins are necessarily collinear along the chosen quantization
axis and the exchange-correlation potential is obtained via V xc
σ = ∂Exc [ρ↑, ρ↓] /∂ρσ. However, rotational invariance
requires that the true variables are the eigenvalues n↑(~r) and n↓(~r) of the spin density matrix ρσσ′ (~r). We can thus
apply standard local spin-density functionals (we chose the formula of Perdew and Wang27) by evaluating the potential
in a locally diagonal frame. The transformation is carried out following the work of K¨ubler et al.28 who used the
spin-1/2 rotation matrix

to locally diagonalize the spin-density matrix:

By working in this representation we express ∂Exc/∂ρσσ′ by Exc/∂nσ plus the introduction of local spin rotation
angles φ (~r) and θ (~r) which are the local azimuthal and polar angles of the magnetization density vector. They are
computed from eqn.(3) through the requirement of vanishing oﬀ-diagonal elements as

where ~d is a position dependent unit vector along the direction of the vector (Re ρ↑↓(~r), Im ρ↑↓(~r), ρ↑↑(~r) − ρ↓↓(~r)).
The presence of the second term in the exchange-correlation potential allows a general coupling of the up- and down-
components of the spinor wavefunctions. The wavefunctions belong to the class TSDW of the Fukutome classiﬁcation
scheme29. To interpret the magnetic properties, we compute the vector magnetization density ~m(~r) by expressing the
spin-density matrix in the form

We associate magnetic moments with individual atoms by integrating each component of ~m(~r) within a sphere cen-
tered on the ions, giving us the local magnetic moment vectors ~µat. The integration radius is chosen to be one half of
the smallest interatomic distance in each cluster to avoid overlap and the resulting spheres contain about 80 − 90 %
of the magnetization density. Taking a larger radius for more distant atoms has a negligible eﬀect on the orientation
of their magnetic moment, although its magnitude becomes somewhat bigger.
As usual, we only treat the valence electrons explicitly, taking care of the ionic core with a pseudopotential approx-
imation. We use the relativistic pseudopotential from Goedecker et al.30, which contains a local part plus a sum
of separable gaussians, optimized to represent a transferable non-local pseudopotential on a coordinate mesh. The
multiplication of the wavefunctions with the non-local part can be limited to a small region around the ions as the
radial projectors fall oﬀ rather quickly. However, 20 integrations within the covalent radius of each atom need to be
performed to correctly account for non-local eﬀects in chromium. The energetics at small ionic separations inside the

clusters further requires us to include the 3s and 3p semi-core electrons into the variational space. Our pseudopotential
also includes spin-orbit terms which ﬁx the orientation of the total magnetization M to the ionic structure thus giving
rise to magnetic anisotropy. The implementation of the ~L · ~S operator is not too costly because we have to deal with a
complex spinor-structure anyway. Spin-orbit eﬀects enable us to test the validity of the usually applied atomic sphere
approximation by studying the intra-atomic dispersion31.

We have carried out an unconstrained structural search by fully minimizing electronic and ionic degrees of freedom.
To ﬁnd the ground state and stable isomers, the ionic positions were optimized by Monte-Carlo sampling applying
the technique of simulated annealing. After some Metropolis steps, the electronic wavefunctions are updated with
Kohn-Sham iterations. The optimization of the ionic geometry involves a minimization of the one-ion energies and is
explained in detail in ref.32. The static Kohn-Sham equations are solved in a combined coordinate and momentum
space representation by using an eﬃcient damped gradient iteration33. Local operators are applied on coordinate space
wavefunctions while the kinetic energy and the action of the spin-orbit operator are computed in momentum space
applying fast Fourier techniques. The Poisson equation is solved via the FALR-method34. As it is more convenient
for most physical observables, electronic wavefunctions and densities are stored on a three-dimensional coordinate
space mesh. We perform our calculations in a cubic box with a mesh spacing of 0.32 a.u. and up to 64 grid points
in each direction. We checked that the mesh size was big enough to avoid artifacts from the boundaries. A detailed
description of our numerics can be found in refs.35.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Before discussing our results we mention some of the various tests we performed in order to increase our conﬁdence in
the Hamiltonian and its numerical implementation. The dimer plays a key role in the description of small chromium
It is known that its subtle electronic properties demand a high accuracy of the Cr-Cr interactions and
clusters.
the numerical representation21,22. By applying the pseudopotential in the semi-core version, our binding energy
(1.98 eV) and bonding length (d0 = 3.25 a.u.) for the antiferromagnetic ground state were in good agreement with
experimental results21 (1.56 eV ± 0.3 eV, dexp = 3.19 a.u.) and previous all-electron or pseudopotential calculations22.
The correct energetic order of the single particle levels as a function of the intra-molecular distance, the symmetry
of the wavefunctions and the properties of the ferromagnetic coupling (d = 5.2 a.u.) could be reproduced as well.
The same holds for the bonding length of the CrO molecule which deviated from the experimental result by 1.3 %.
Additionally, we achieved degenerate d-states up to a level of 1 % and the correct energetic order of 3d and 4s-levels
in the chromium atom. The rotationally invariant spin-density theory was checked by letting the FE conﬁguration
of the dimer relax to the AF ground state. Like in the collinear theory, all spins were initially restricted to point in
the z-direction. The wavefunctions and energies of the ﬁnal result turned out to be identical with the ground state as
computed in a separate collinear approach although the quantization axis of both atoms had rotated by ± 90 degrees
during the iteration. This conﬁrms the degeneracy of the electronic properties with respect to the orientation of their
spin. Furthermore we have been able to verify the result of Car and coworkers13 concerning the noncollinear spin
arrangement of Fe3.

Our results for the energetically lowest noncollinear conﬁgurations of small chromium clusters CrN (3 ≤ N ≤
6) are presented in Fig.1. All structures except the one of Cr4 represent ground states. The corresponding total
magnetization is shown in Table I. Our geometric and magnetic structures are obtained by performing up to 50 full
Monte-Carlo runs per cluster starting from arbitrary ionic coordinates. A couple of thousand Kohn-Sham iterations
are usually necessary to completely relax the electronic degrees of freedom. This is because the numerical convergence
with respect to the direction of the local moments (governed by competing interatomic exchange interactions) is much
slower than with respect to their magnitude which is determined by stronger intra-atomic interactions.
The principle eﬀect which leads to noncollinear arrangements in chromium clusters can best be demonstrated in
Cr3. Our calculation restricted to collinear spins gives a trimer that basically consists of a dimer plus a loosely
attached third atom, very similar to the result of Cheng and Wang23. It is obviously impossible for the atoms to
couple antiferromagnetically with all their neighbors at a time so that a FE interaction between two atoms becomes
inevitable – a situation that we refer to in the following as frustration. The repulsive eﬀect of the FE coupling at
smaller distances pushes one atom away and results in a large interatomic distance of 4.97 a.u.. If the noncollinear
channel is accessible, however, the trimer is free to achieve the closest to AF-like coupling it can by rotating two local
magnetic moments in the x-z plane (see Fig.1). As the frustration is now reduced, the third atom comes much closer (d
= 3.67 a.u.) and enables a buildup of molecular orbits which enhances the total binding inside the trimer signiﬁcantly.
The associated reduction of |~µat| for the formerly isolated atom results in a decrease of Mat from 2 µB to 0.69 µB. The
energy diﬀerence with respect to the collinear ground state ∆Enc is 0.083 eV per atom (see Table I) which amounts
to 7.8 % of the binding energy of Cr3. A look a the interatomic distances and the tilted local moments suggests that

3

P

the dimer lost its dominant role. However, the fact that the ground state is not an equilateral triangle with angles of
120o between the local magnetic moments (this would equal the best possible AF-like coupling) indicates that some
trace of the strong dimer binding from the collinear calculation still persists. Unlike the situation in Fe3, the linear
isomer of Cr3 did not favor noncollinear spins.
The noncollinear spin structure of Cr3 can be understood as a compromise between the energetically very favorable
3
AF coupling and frustration. This can be seen easily with the very simple Hamiltonian H = β
i<j ~σi · ~σj for three
spins on an equilateral triangle. Here β is negative for AF coupling. In a collinear restriction, the lowest energy state
formed by a product wavefunction is (↑↑↓) with an energy expectation hHi = β. Taking instead the state with 120o
angles between the spin directions gives a lower energy of hHi = 3/2 β. For higher atomic spins (as they occur in our
numerical computations) the preference of the noncollinear conﬁguration would of course become more pronounced
due to the larger number of exchange interactions.
In Fig.2 we show the rotation angle θ(~r) in the x-z plane of the trimer including its contour lines. The azimuthal
angle φ(~r) is zero at any gridpoint due to the magnetic anisotropy energy although this quantity is rather small. But
it seems that even a diﬀerence of a few meV per atom is enough to keep the magnetization inside the plane of the
trimer, an observation which agrees with the ﬁndings of ref.11. The orientation of the magnetization density vector
is remarkably uniform in the regions surrounding the atoms (θ ≃ ±74o, 0o with a small oscillation of ∆θ = ±10o)
and varies signiﬁcantly only right between them where the charge density is essentially zero. This is why a smaller
integration radius only inﬂuences the magnitude of ~µat and not its orientation. The rapid change from θ = −90o to
θ = 90o is related to a spin ﬂip in these interatomic regions. We ﬁnd an intra-atomic spin dispersion of around 6o
which partly comes from spin-orbit coupling. But the dispersion is also induced by the trend to an AF coupling with
the neighbors. The same especially holds for the variation of the spin direction close to the domains of other atoms.
The change of θ at the ionic positions is an artifact of the pseudopotential approximation. A detailed analysis further
shows that these features are common to all investigated chromium clusters.
The collinear ground state of Cr4 was found to have a rectangular structure (not shown) with bonding lengths of 3.35
a.u. and 4.62 a.u.. The double dimer structure of this geometry appears to be resistant to non-collinear eﬀects as the
distance of two atoms with parallel moments is very large (5.7 a.u.). But in the case of the lowest isomer, a rhombus,
frustration becomes important again resulting in noncollinear spins (see Fig.1). The argumentation follows the case of
Cr3, the triangles in Cr4 are very similar and have only slightly larger bonding lengths. A higher total magnetization
of Mat = 1.33 µB leads to an energy gain of 0.12 eV per atom with respect to the corresponding collinear state of the
rhombus and halves the energy diﬀerence to the rectangular ground state. The isomer of Cr4 is unique in that the
energetically favored noncollinear conﬁguration has a bigger total magnetization than its collinear counterpart. The
magnitudes of ~µat, however, were almost identical in both cases. It is also noteworthy that the rhombus structure
provides angles between the local moments of almost exactly 120o although the bondings are not equivalent. This
seems to be related with the larger moments of the furthermost atoms (∆|~µat| = 0.6 µB).
The properties of the noncollinear ground state of Cr5 can be understood if one considers the pentamer as consisting
of three triangles. Although the bonding lengths are bigger, each of these triangles exhibits the same basic features as
Cr3 and the local moments are again arranged in such a way that the best possible AF-like coupling is achieved. We
also see that the magnitude of ~µat decreases with increasing coordination number. Note that the reﬂection symmetry
of the geometry is the same as the symmetry of the magnetization. The gain in binding energy with respect to the
best collinear state is 0.054 eV per atom (= 3.7 % of the binding energy) which is less than for the trimer. But the
total magnetization is again clearly reduced from 1.03 to 0.53 µB per atom. The lowest isomer is a bipyramid with a
noncollinear spin structure as well and Mat = 0.79 µB. Its energy diﬀerence of 0.6 eV to the ground state is 0.25 eV
higher than in the collinear case. Cr5 is the only cluster we found where the noncollinear and collinear geometries
diﬀer by more than just a variation of the bonding lengths. Our lowest collinear state looks similar to the geometry
of Cheng and Wang and has a 2v-symmetry. However, its total magnetization of 1.05 µB is somewhat higher than
their result of 0.93 µB.
The shape of Cr6, on the other hand, resembles the collinear one very closely. Cr6 is the smallest cluster that displays
a fully three dimensional geometric and magnetic structure in the ground state. It consists of three dimers distributed
over two triangles in which frustration sets in. Each of the ~µat is exactly antiparallel to the moment of its partner
atom in the dimer. The azimuthal angles are φ = ±19o for the atoms in the foreground and φ = 0o for the ones
in the background which are slightly closer. The bonding lengths in the triangles are about 6 % shorter than in the
collinear case and the dimer distances are somewhat bigger.
It is important to note that in spite of a vanishing
total magnetization and although the dimer seems to recover a certain inﬂuence, tilted spins are still energetically
favored. However, the gain of ∆Enc = 0.022 eV per atom only accounts for 1.4 % of the binding energy of Cr6.
This indicates that the impact of noncollinear eﬀects on the energetics becomes gradually smaller with rising cluster
size. Further calculations for Cr7 and Cr9 conﬁrm this trend and predict that the noncollinear geometries essentially
equal the collinear ones for Nat ≥ 6. On the other hand our results so far show that noncollinear spin conﬁgurations
considerably reduce the total magnetization of the ground states although it might not be reﬂected too much in the

4

binding energy. This can be understood in terms of the competing interatomic exchange interactions which involve
only small energy changes during the rotation of local moments (see above).

We shall ﬁnally discuss how noncollinear eﬀects might provide a way to ameliorate the disagreement between the
measured total magnetic moments of CrN (N ≥ 9) by Bloomﬁeld et al.24 and previous theoretical results23,25. The
Stern-Gerlach experiment extracted an upper bound for Mat, Mat < 0.77 µB, assuming a superparamagnetic behavior
of the chromium clusters. Earlier calculations, however, report values for the magnetization of some clusters that are
much higher25. The values from Cheng and Wang for Cr12 (Mat = 1.67 µB) and Cr13 (Mat = 1.06 µB) also exceed
the experimental limit. The trend from smaller clusters gives one the hope that noncollinear eﬀects might reduce the
diﬀerence. However, an unconstrained simultaneous calculation of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom surpasses
our computational resources for clusters as large as Cr12.
Instead, we start the optimization procedure from the
geometries of Cheng and Wang. This is a reasonable approach in the light of the very good agreement with our
collinear structures and the small changes in geometry that are induced by noncollinear spins. Our ﬁnal magnetic
and geometric conﬁguration of Cr12 is shown in Fig.3. The free relaxation leads to a shortening of the bonding
lengths between the corner atoms of about 5 % and slightly bigger distances of the capping atoms but the bulk-like
bcc-structure of the collinear geometry clearly persists. The z-components of the local magnetic moments vary on
alternating x-y planes, but only the moments of the corner atoms have signiﬁcant x- and y-components. All the spins
of the lightest-colored corner atoms point inside the cube towards the central atom, whereas the spins of the slightly
darker corner atoms point outside and away from the next atom. This dispersion is related to some frustration of the
corner atoms in connection with the preferred AF coupling to the moments of their nearest neighbors (darker atoms).
A magnetic arrangement like that can be seen as a precursor to the bulk behavior in form of an antiparallel order
between neighboring atomic layers. The tilted spins of the corner atoms (φ = ±43o, θ = ±34o and φ = ±45o, θ = ±30o)
have pairwise opposite x- and y-components so that the sum of their net-moments in positive z-direction is reduced.
The moments of the darker atoms, however, show almost no dispersion in negative z-direction. All this results in a
much smaller total magnetization of Mat = 0.81 µB which is now very close to the experimental limit. The remarkable
reduction of ∆Mat = −0.86 µB is associated with ∆Enc = 0.011 eV per atom which equals only 0.5 % of the binding
energy of Cr12. A very similar situation leads to Mat = 0.59 µB in the case of Cr13, a value that is even below the
experimental limit. The noncollinear gain amounts to ∆Enc = 0.008 eV per atom. The Cr13 result is preliminary and
might slightly change (∆Mat ≤ ± 0.05 µB) because the electronic degrees of freedom were not completely relaxed. But
we can still conclude that the total magnetization of Cr12 and Cr13 as obtained with the general LSDA represents a
considerable improvement with respect to the experiment.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We present the ﬁrst study of noncollinear eﬀects in antiferromagnetically coupled clusters by applying the general,
rotationally invariant LSDA for the electronic degrees of freedom. Their interaction with the ions is described in terms
of a relativistic, non-local pseudopotential which has been thoroughly tested. The magnetic and geometric structures
are obtained by employing a simulated annealing technique for the ionic optimization together with interlaced Kohn-
Sham iterations which update the wavefunctions simultaneously.
Our collinear conﬁgurations, which we use in order to extract the eﬀect of noncollinear spins, agree very well with
the results of Cheng and Wang23. We ﬁnd that all investigated chromium clusters show a pronounced trend to
noncollinear spin conﬁgurations. This is caused by a subtle interplay between the preferred magnetic order and
frustration, a situation which can in principle occur in all clusters of elements that favor antiferromagnetic spins.
Therefore our considerations appear to be of a more general nature although the special properties of chromium
indicate that noncollinear eﬀects could be less dramatic in other transition metals. The results for Nat ≤ 13 show that
the inﬂuence of noncollinearity on various observables becomes gradually smaller with rising cluster size. Induced
changes of the cluster geometry are generally restricted to an alteration of the bonding lengths, with the exception of
Cr5. However, we observe a universal reduction of the total magnetization which is signiﬁcant even in those clusters
for which a variation of the magnetic distribution is not clearly reﬂected in the binding energy any more (Cr12 and
Cr13). This eﬀect is related to the small energetic changes which occur during the rotation of local moments, an
aspect that makes a proper convergence of the Kohn-Sham iteration very time consuming. Furthermore, our ﬁndings
show that tilted spins due to frustration can even be favored when the total magnetization vanishes (Cr6) or the
corresponding ground state is collinear like in Cr4. The free variation of the spin quantization axis ﬁnally leads to a
better agreement with the experiment concerning the total magnetization of Cr12 and Cr13. It can be concluded that
noncollinear eﬀects appear to be an important ingredient for a deeper understanding of the subtle magnetic properties
in transition metal clusters.

TABLE I. Total magnetization per atom Mat (in units µB) for the ground states of
CrN and gain in binding energy ∆Enc (in units eV/atom) with respect to their collinear
counterparts. In case of a collinear ground state the result for the energetically lowest
noncollinear isomer is given in parentheses. The last column shows the corresponding
magnetization from the collinear calculation of Cheng and Wang23. The star at Nat = 13
indicates that the structure was not completely relaxed.

FIG. 3. Geometric and magnetic structure of the noncollinear ground state of Cr12. The notation
follows the one from Fig.1. The magnetic moments of the lighter-colored atoms show a dispersion in
the positive z-direction whereas the darker atoms almost exactly point in the negative z-direction. We
also display the absolute values of the azimuthal and polar angles of ~µat for all 4 groups of atoms.

The properties of neutral and anionic PdN clusters were investigated with spin-density-functional
calculations. The ground state structures are three-dimensional for N >3 and they are magnetic with
a spin-triplet for 2≤N ≤7 and a spin nonet for N =13 neutral clusters. Structural- and spin-isomers
were determined and an anomalous increase of the magnetic moment with temperature is predicted
for a Pd7 ensemble. Vertical electron detachment and ionization energies were calculated and the
former agree well with measured values for Pd

−
N .

Enhancement of magnetism in ﬁnite clusters made
of elements that are ferromagnetic as bulk solids has
been demonstrated through Stern-Gerlach (SG) deﬂec-
tion measurements [1], and it is understood to derive
from reduced atomic coordination resulting in stronger
electron localization. However, the emergence of mag-
netism in small clusters of close-shell non-magnetic atoms
is clouded by uncertainty. Palladium aggregates (with a
[Kr] 4d10 structure of the atom) are particularly interest-
ing since the bulk metal is known to be ”almost” mag-
netic, with the emergence of magnetism predicted to re-
quire a mere 6 % dilation of the interatomic distance [2].
Experimental information is limited to SG measurements
on PdN clusters with N >12 (where the clusters were
found to be non-magnetic) [3] or to inferences from (non-
magnetic) photoemission studies [4]. Additionally, sys-
tematic theoretical investigations of magnetic properties
are lacking, limited only to neutral Pd13 [5,6].

We report on an extensive density-functional-theory
(DFT) study pertaining to size-dependent evolutionary
−
N clusters with
patterns of the properties of PdN and Pd
N =1−7 and N =13. The ground states (GSs) of the neu-
tral and anionic clusters are found to undergo an early
transition (i.e. for N >3) to three-dimensional (3D) ones
and possess a non-zero magnetic moment (e.g., for neu-
tral clusters with N ≤7 a spin triplet, S=1, and a spin
nonet, S=4, for N =13).
In addition to higher-energy
structural isomers (STIs) we determined sequences of
close-lying spin isomers (SPIs). For a Pd7 ensemble, we
predict an increase of the magnetic moment with tem-
perature due to the thermal accessibility of such iso-
mers. All the SPIs exhibit high local magnetic moments
including the singlet states with an antifer-
(LMMs),
romagnetic LMM coupling. Our structural determina-
tions are corroborated by the remarkable agreement be-
tween the calculated vertical electron detachment ener-
gies (vDEs) from the cluster anions and photoelectron
spectroscopy (PES) measurements [4,7,8].

In this study the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations with
generalized gradient corrections (GGA) [9] were solved

using the Born-Oppenheimer local-spin-density molecu-
lar dynamics (BO-LSD-MD) method [10], with scalar-
relativistic [11] non-local pseudopotentials [12]. Cluster
geometries were determined via symmetry-unrestricted
structural optimizations through a rather exhaustive
search starting from various structures including those
suggested in previous studies of certain Pd clusters
[13–15] and other metal clusters [16,17]. For each struc-
ture spin-restricted optimizations were performed cover-
ing all energetically important spin multiplicities.

−
The GS geometries and STIs for both PdN and Pd
N
are rather similar and they follow the same structural
evolution, exhibiting Jahn-Teller distortions from the
ideal symmetric structures (see Fig. 1), with a transi-
tion to 3D conﬁgurations at N >3 [18]. The GSs (i.e.
maximal binding energy EB in Fig. 1) of PdN with
N ≤7 have a triplet spin multiplicity (see open squares
in Fig. 1(A-F)), while for Pd13 the GS is associated with
a nonet (S=4) spin conﬁguration (see Fig. 1G). On the
−
other hand, the GS spin-multiplicities of the Pd
N an-
ions (ﬁlled symbols in Fig. 1) vary non-monotonically
with N (doublet for N =2,3,4, and 6; quartet for N =5;
sextet for N =7, and octet for N =13). We note here
that the higher-lying STIs [19] and SPIs of the neutral
and anionic clusters become thermally accessible with in-
creasing cluster size (see temperature scales [20] on the
right-hand-side in Fig. 1).

The binding energies of the GS clusters increase rather
monotonically with N (Fig. 2a), showing enhanced local
−
stabilities for Pd
3 and Pd4 [21]. The average nearest-
neighbor bond-length (hRnni) of the GS structures and
the SPIs are very similar [22], converging rapidly to the
bulk value (2.75 ˚A [23]).

The calculated vDEs from the cluster anions are in a
remarkable agreement with values determined from PES
measurements [4,7,8] (Fig. 2b). For all the clusters, we
display the vDEs only for the GS (structural and spin)
−
conﬁgurations of the anions, except for Pd
7 where we
show the vDEs for both the GS (S = 5/2) and its next
(higher-in-energy) SPI (S = 3/2) (the diﬀerence in en-

1

ergy between the two isomers is 0.11 eV, corresponding to
only 170 K in vibrational temperature [20]), with the lat-
ter exhibiting a better agreement with the experimental
−
data. These results suggest that for Pd
7 the measured
vDE may correspond to this higher-energy SPI which is
accessible already at very low temperatures, while for the
other clusters studied here the vDEs are determined by
the GS structures over a broad temperature range.

−
3 →Pd

The only (slight) discrepancy between the calculated
−
and measured VDEs is for Pd
3 (see Fig. 2b). How-
ever, we observe from this ﬁgure that the predicted vDE
−
(2.0 eV) for Pd
3 is rather close to the dissociation en-
−
2 +Pd (see ﬁlled circle
ergy (ED) of the process Pd
in Fig. 2b at ED=2.41 eV, compared to a measured
value of 2.26 eV [24]). This implies that this dissociation
channel may compete with the electron detachment un-
der appropriate experimental conditions. Consequently,
−
we assign the vDE of Pd
3 to the next higher feature in
the measured PES [8]) occuring at 1.88 eV which agrees
with the predicted value, and the lower measured value
(at 1.66 eV, marked by a cross in Fig. 2b) is attributed
−
to the vDE of a (hot) Pd
2 dissociation product [25] (the
same conclusions apply to the photoelectron spectrum of
−
3 shown in Fig. 2 of ref. [4]); for a similar interpre-
Pd
−
tation of the measured PES of Au
3 see Refs. 16 and
26.

The vertical ionization potentials predicted by us (vIP
in Fig. 2c) start at the atomic value of 8.28 eV com-
pared to the measured ﬁrst IP of Pd, 8.33 eV [23]; the
calculated second IP of Pd (27.34 eV) also agrees with
the experimental one (27.75 eV) [23]. The predicted val-
ues for N =2 and 3 are close to each other followed by
a marked drop for clusters with N >3, which is likely to
reﬂect the transition to 3D structures. Convergence to
the bulk limit (the work function of Pd is 4.97 eV [27])
is slow. No measured IP values have been reported.
The multitude of spin-multiplicities for the Pd

−
N clus-
ters results in a considerable variation of the magnetic
moment per atom µ=2SµB/N (solid squares in Fig. 2d)
with particularly high values of µ=0.6, 0.71 and 0.54 µB
for N =5, 7 and 13, respectively. On the other hand, the
occurrence of a triplet GS for the neutral clusters under-
lies a monotonic 1/N decrease of µ for N =1−7 (open
squares in Fig. 2d), with an unexpected high value of
0.62 µB for Pd13 which is higher than the experimen-
tal [3] estimate (µ<0.4 µB).

The rather surprising existence of energetically favor-
able high-spin isomers for Pd clusters originates from
sd-hybridization developing upon bonding, with the d-
orbitals’ weight diminished somewhat on each atom, re-
sulting in a situation reminiscent of open-shell transition
metals. The total magnetic moment of the cluster is com-
prised of sizable atomic LMMs (µℓ∼±(0.3 − 0.6)µB) that
couple antiferromagnetically in the spin-compensated
singlet states, and align themselves in SPIs with high
total µ. This is illustrated for the icosahedral Pd13 clus-

ter in Fig. 2 where the (gapless) density of states (DOS)
of the S = 0 singlet SPI is shown in Fig. 2e and the
corresponding spin-polarization density in Fig. 2g (left);
note the non-uniform spatial distribution of the spin-
polarization reﬂected in the diﬀerent line-shapes of the
DOS of the up and down spins. In the S = 2 spin-quintet
SPI the minority spin polarization is localized on three
sites located in a triangle (Fig. 2g, middle). In the S = 4
spin-nonet GS cluster all the sites are spin-polarized in
the same direction (Fig. 2g, right), and it’s stability is
reﬂected in the large gap in the majority-spin DOS near
the Fermi energy (see spin ↑ in Fig. 2f).

kB T

Intriguing conclusions can be made regarding the ther-
mal behavior of certain Pd clusters in SG measurements;
−
7 at room tem-
here we consider the case of Pd7 and Pd
perature. Neglecting the vibrational and entropic diﬀer-
ences between the isomers, the probability to ﬁnd a clus-
ter with spin S, irrespective of its atomic isomeric struc-
ture, is given by PN,T (S) = PI exp ( N EB (N,I,S)
)/ZN,T
with the Boltzmann constant kB, the ensemble temper-
ature T , the structural isomer index I, and the (normal-
izing) partition function ZN,T . Several spin isomers of
the neutral as well as the anionic heptamer have a ﬁnite
P7,T (S) (Fig. 3a) even for low temperatures, leading us
to predict that in a SG experiment up to 3 diﬀerent de-
ﬂection angles should be measurable. Note, that while an
increase in temperature depopulates the Pd7 pentagonal
bipyramid triplet (S=1) GS, the singlet (S=0) state of
that structure and the capped octahedron quintet (S=2)
state (Fig. 1F) gain statistical weight. Consequently, we
predict that for Pd7 a rise in temperature would lead
ﬁrst to a decrease of the thermally averaged magnetic
moment per atom hµiN,T =PS 2SµBPN,T (S)/N due to a
sharp increase in the population of the singlet state. The
subsequent increase of hµiN,T (see Fig. 3b, T>200 K)
results from the higher thermal population of the quin-
tet state relative to the GS triplet (Fig. 3a). [29] Such
−
anomaly does not occur in the case of the Pd
7 cluster
where the doublet (S=1/2) and quartet (S=3/2) states
start to coexist with the sextet (S=5/2) GS at elevated
temperatures (Fig. 3a). For both neutral and anionic
Pd13, the higher-lying isomers play essentially no role for
T <800 K resulting in a weak temperature dependence of
hµiN,T (Fig. 3b).

In summary, we found that unlike atomic and bulk
Pd, both neutral and anionic PdN clusters (2 ≤ N ≤ 7
and N = 13) are magnetic, with relatively high LMMs.
Underlying this behavior is the hybridization of atomic
s and d states when clusters are formed, that depletes
local d-contribution around each atom and leads to an
open-shell-like behavior. The abundance of close-lying
SPIs for certain clusters should be detectable in ther-
mally controlled SG experiments, and we predict an en-
semble of Pd7 clusters to exhibit an (anomalous) in-
crease of the magnetic moment with temperature. The

2

remarkable agreement between the calculated and mea-
sured vDEs of the cluster anions corroborates the pre-
dicted atomic structures. Our results provide the ﬁrst
quantitative predictions pertaining to the emergence of
−
pronounced magnetic properties of PdN and Pd
N clus-
ters, unlike the weak magnetic tendencies inferred indi-
rectly from PES data [4]; note in particular the contrast
between our results for Pd7 (see Fig. 2d and Fig. 3)
and the suggestion of a zero spin GS for Pd7 given in
Ref. [4]. Furthermore, our study motivates temperature-
dependent magnetic deﬂection (SG) measurements and
further investigations of free and supported Pd clusters,
including correlations between their magnetic properties
and their catalytic activity [30].

13). The reduced bond
−
length of spin-doublet GS of Pd
2 is in agreement with
an experimental analysis where a similar reduction in
bond length (0.037 ˚A) has been reported [8]. Inspection
of the KS molecular orbitals (MO) of Pd2 reveals that
the highest occupied MO and the lowest unoccupied one
are both sd hybridized bonding states of the same spatial
symmetry but with diﬀerent spins, and consequently for-
mation of the dimer anion (involving occupation of the
lowest unoccupied MO) strengthens the bond and results
in shrinkage of the bond length.

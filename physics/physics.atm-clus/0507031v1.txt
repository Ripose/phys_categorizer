The Skornyakov–Ter-Martirosyan three-boson integral equations in momentum space are transformed into
differential equations. This allows us to take into account quite directly the Danilov condition providing self-
adjointness of the underlying three-body Hamiltonian with zero-range pair interactions. For the helium trimer
the numerical solutions of the resulting differential equations are compared with those of the Faddeev-type AGS
equations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of a weekly bound state of two helium
atoms [1] and problems concerning the stability of Bose con-
densates of alkali atoms (see, e.g., [2]) stimulated many calcu-
lations of the properties of three-particle systems determined
by pair interactions with a large scattering length a0 compared
to the range r0 of the pair forces,

r0
a0 ≪

1.

(1)

On the one hand, this condition poses problems in the nu-
merical solution of the Faddeev equations with realistic atom-
atom potentials, on the other hand it forms the basis of the
zero-range model of the two-body interaction ((r0
0)). This
model determines the motion of particles beyond the pair-
interaction region, admits an analytic simpliﬁcation, and can
be used for the description of real physical systems provided
the condition (1) is fulﬁlled.

→

The zero-range model (ZRM) for three-body systems,
though having obvious advantages and wide application, has a
considerable drawback. The Hamiltonian of these systems is
not self-adjoint (see, for example, [3] ) and the Schr¨odinger
equation has quadratically integrable solutions at any en-
ergy. This fact was pointed out in [4] in analyzing poor at-
tempts to solve the nd-scattering problem with the use of the
Skornyakov–Ter-Martirosyan (STM) integral equations [5]
within the zero-range model of nucleon-nucleon interaction.
In particular, at large momenta k of the relative motion of a
particle and a pair the asymptotic behavior of the wave func-
tion was shown to have at any energy Z the form

j (k, Z) = A

sin(µ0 ln(k))

Here, the constant µ0 depends on the ratio of the particle
masses, and only the coefﬁcients A and B depend on the en-
ergy. To determine the three-body spectrum, Danilov [4] sug-
gested to use the relation between the coefﬁcients A(Z) and
B(Z) with an energy-independent parameter g ,

A(Z) = g B(Z),

(3)

following from the orthogonality condition of eigenfunctions.
In the same year Minlos and Faddeev [3] showed that the
Danilov condition is a special case among possible extensions
of the Hamiltonian to a self-adjoint one. Even after the ex-
tension, a solution to the STM equation has one free param-
eter. This opens the possibility of describing real three-body
systems by adjusting the free parameter to a known spectral
point [4].

Unfortunately, the Danilov condition for an unambiguous
solution of the STM equations practically cannot be used in
numerical calculations. But it was used for an analytic inves-
tigation of the ZRM three-body spectrum [6]. In this reference
it has been shown that a three-body collapse (the Thomas ef-
fect [7]) is a speciﬁc feature of the ZRM.

There are several approaches using the ZRM beyond the
scope of the STM equations, among them the adiabatic ex-
pansion in conﬁguration space (see, e.g., [8]). Just in this
approach the so-called Eﬁmov effect was observed, i.e., the
fact that three-body spectra concentrate on zero total energy if
the two-body scattering length
tends to inﬁnity [9]. The
a0
|
result of adiabatic expansions is an inﬁnite system of differ-
ential equations coupled in terms of ﬁrst derivatives. The
problem of non-self-adjointness of the three-body Hamilto-
nian is solved by cutting off the effective interaction at small
distances. This method of regularization implicitly introduces
three-body forces. In this case, the cut-off radius plays the
role of the free parameter.

|

Three-body forces are introduced more explicitly in the ef-
fective ﬁeld theory (EFT) [10], causing an integral equation
that is similar to the STM equation, but contains artiﬁcial
terms. A free parameter enters the phenomenological terms

of the kernel of the integral equation and the free terms of the
integral equation for the scattering problem [10].

Finally, we would like to draw attention to the two-pole t-
matrix model for the description of three-boson systems [11]
which employs the Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) [12] ver-
sion of the Faddeev equations [13]. The position of the sec-
ond pole on the unphysical sheet is treated in this model as a
parameter of the integral equation. When the position of the
second pole tends to inﬁnity, the STM equations are repro-
duced [11]. This method deals with compact equations and is
well suited for numerical calculations, but is of little use for
analytic considerations.

II. FORMALISM

In the present paper we follow another strategy. Transform-
ing the STM equations into differential equations allows us to
take into account the Danilov condition quite directly. For this
purpose, we construct an inﬁnite system of differential equa-
tions in momentum space with a very simple relation between
the equations.

The homogeneous part of the STM equation for the elastic
scattering amplitude [5] of a boson of mass m on a two-boson
bound state of energy e =

(11)

It can be veriﬁed that the asymptotics of F coincides with
that of F0 and the contribution of the remaining terms de-
creases at inﬁnity. At κ/l = 0 the system of equations (9,10)
becomes uncoupled and has a simple solution, F = F0 =
sin(µ0 ln(t)), which gives, together with condition (11), the
2p n). This spectrum contains the
spectrum En = E0 exp(

tree-body collapse at large l
for n < 0 [6], and Eﬁmov’s con-
centration towards the point Z = 0 at extremely small κ for
n > 0. At small ﬁnite κ we can restrict ourselves to Eq. (9)
that belongs to a well known class of differential equations
(Heun) [14].

III. RESULTS

Let us ﬁrst demonstrate the convergence of the solutions for
an increasing number N of equations (9,10). To this end, we
denote the solution of this system of equations by FR which,
upon substitution into the right-hand side of (4), gives the
function FL. The degree of proximity of FR and FL shows to
what extent the solution of the system (9,10) is close to that
of the integral equation. Figure 1 shows this convergence for
N = 1, 2, 3. The energy parameter Z/e = (l /κ)2 was chosen
to be 1.57. This value corresponds to the calculations [15]
for the binding energy of a helium trimer.
In this way we
ﬁx the free parameter characteristically occurring in all STM
treatments. The good convergence achieved already for N = 3
indicates the efﬁciency of our differential equations approach.
Instead of making a similar consideration for the bound-
state spectrum, we compare our present results with alterna-
tive calculations. In this context we use the binding energies

of a helium trimer, obtained in [15, 16] for realistic pair poten-
tials, and the calculations of the binding energies via Faddeev-
type AGS integral equations in the framework of the above-
mentioned two-pole pair t-matrix [11]. Since, depending on
the position of the t-matrix pole on the unphysical sheet, one
can obtain as many bound trimer states as one wishes, we will
label the highest bound state by ”1” and the following one by
”2”.

Figure 2 shows energy E2 as a function of energy E1 cal-
culated with Eqs. (9,10) for N = 21. Also shown are the
calculations for a two-level trimer within the two-pole pair t-
matrix [11], and our calculations in the same model when the
parameters of the pair t-matrix admit the existence of three
and four bound states of a boson trimer. All the energies are
given in units of the dimer energy. We see that there is only
a rather small difference between the corresponding curves.
Quite interesting is the fact that the calculations for a helium
trimer [15, 16] with realistic pair potentials lie just between
these curves.

Thus, we have demonstrated that Eqs. (9,10) represent a
very efﬁcient tool for calculating three-boson trimers. These
equations can also be extended to scattering problems.

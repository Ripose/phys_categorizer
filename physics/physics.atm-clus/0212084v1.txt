Abstract

Low-energy orbital magnetic dipole excitations, known as scissors mode (SM), are studied in

alkali metal clusters. Subsequent dynamic and static eﬀects are explored. The treatment is based

on a self-consistent microscopic approach using the jellium approximation for the ionic background

and the Kohn-Sham mean ﬁeld for the electrons. The microscopic origin of SM and its main features

(structure of the mode in light and medium clusters, separation into low- and high-energy plasmons,

coupling high-energy M1 scissors and E2 quadrupole plasmons, contributions of shape isomers, etc)

are discussed. The scissors M1 strength acquires large values with increasing cluster size. The mode

is responsible for the van Vleck paramagnetism of spin-saturated clusters. Quantum shell eﬀects

induce a fragile interplay between Langevin diamagnetism and van Vleck paramagnetism and lead

to a remarkable dia-para anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility of particular light clusters. Finally,

several routes for observing the SM experimentally are discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This paper deals with orbital magnetism in metal clusters. Because of a possibly large

number of atoms, the valence electrons may accede single-particle orbitals with very high

angular momenta. The occupation of these orbitals has a large impact in cluster static

magnetism [1, 2, 3] or in collective magnetic modes of orbital nature [1, 4, 5, 6]. Two

remarkable examples are the scissors [1, 4, 5] and twist [6] modes. The scissors mode is

strictly correlated with cluster deformation. It can be viewed as a small-amplitude rotational

oscillation of a spheroid of valence electrons against a spheroid of the ionic background (hence

the name SM).

The SM is a general dynamical phenomenon already found or predicted in diﬀerent quan-

tum ﬁnite systems. It was ﬁrst proposed [7] and observed [8] in atomic nuclei where it still

remains a hot topic for both experimental and theoretical studies (for a review see [9]).

It was later predicted in a variety of diﬀerent systems, like metal clusters [1, 4], quantum

dots [10] and ultra-cold superﬂuid gas of fermionic atoms [11]. More remarkably, it was

predicted [12] and observed [13] in a Bose-Einstein condensate. All these diﬀerent systems

have two features in common: The broken spherical symmetry and the two-component na-

ture (neutrons and protons in nuclei, valence electrons and ions in atomic clusters, electrons

and surrounding media in quantum dots, atoms and the trap in dilute Fermi gas and Bose

condensate).

The SM strongly aﬀects orbital magnetism in alkali metal clusters. It can be described

in terms of Larmor diamagnetism and temperature-independent van Vleck paramagnetism

[1, 2]. They are both weak and, therefore, need to be studied in systems, like alkali metal clus-

ters, where strong forms of magnetism, like ferromagnetism, are absent. Being a low-energy

mode, the SM determines the van Vleck paramagnetism and causes a strong anisotropy

in the magnetic susceptibility [1, 14]. Moreover, some particular light clusters can exhibit

dia-para anisotropy, being diamagnetic along the z symmetry axis and paramagnetic in x-,

y-directions [14].

The SM has already been studied in schematic [1] and microscopic [4, 14, 15] approaches.

The microscopic calculations, though accounting for quantum shells eﬀects, were not fully

self-consistent. A deformed Woods-Saxon [16], rather than a self-consistent Kohn-Sham,

one-body potential was adopted. The quadrupole deformation was deduced from other

2

models or experimental estimates. Certainly, we need to perform fully self-consistent calcu-

lations based on density-functional theory in order to settle the subtle issues, like the fragile

dia-para anisotropy, the role of the ionic structure, triaxiality, shape isomers, etc..

Self-consistent calculations, accounting for the ionic structure, were performed for spin-

saturated ground and spin-polarized isomeric states of light sodium clusters Na12 and Na16

[5]. It was found that the scissors response remains determined basically by the global defor-

mation, in spite of the fact that triaxiality and ionic structure induce a strong fragmentation

in the strength. It was also shown that the detailed ionic structure destroys locally spher-

ical symmetry thereby causing a ﬁnite, though very weak, M1 response (transverse optical

mode) even in clusters with zero global deformation.

Calculations of the same level of completeness become prohibitive as one moves to heav-

ier clusters. For this reason, we are forced to use in the present paper the Kohn-Sham

approach with a soft jellium model for the ionic background [17]. This simpliﬁes greatly

the calculations and allows to proceed to heavier clusters. At the same time, the jellium

approach is accurate enough for the principle problems considered here. The treatment of

the electrons is fully self-consistent. We adopt a deformed Kohn-Sham mean ﬁeld using the

energy functional of [18]. The cluster shape (in terms of axial quadrupole and hexadecapole

deformations) is determined by varying the jellium deformation and minimizing the total

energy of the system. The optical response in the linear regime is calculated within the

separable random-phase-approximation (SRPA) method [19, 20] self-consistently derived

from the Kohn-Sham functional. The SRPA has been already successfully employed for the

description of the dipole plasmon in spherical [21] and deformed [20, 22] alkali metal clusters.

In the present paper, we will consider both the optical M1 response and static magnetic

orbital eﬀects. In Section 2, macroscopic and microscopic treatments of the SM are brieﬂy

outlined. In Section 3 the calculation scheme is presented. The optical response is discussed

in Sections 4 and 5. It will be shown that, in analogy with the electric dipole plasmon in de-

formed clusters [20, 22], the M1 response in light clusters has a distinctive proﬁle determined

by the deformation. Instead, due to a strong Landau damping and contributions of shape

isomers, the response in medium clusters becomes vague and the SM can be viewed as a

statistical mix of contributions from diﬀerent cluster shapes. Besides, we discuss structure of

the residual interaction and explain a small collective shift in SM excitations. The coupling

between the high-energy SM branch and the electric quadrupole plasmon is demonstrated.

3

In Section 6, the dia-para anisotropy is discussed. In Section 7, we estimate perspectives

to observe the SM in photo-absorption, Raman scattering and inelastic electron scattering.

The conclusions are given in Section 8.

II. THE SCISSORS MODE: BRIEF OUTLINE

The macroscopic and microscopic treatment of the SM in clusters is discussed in detail

in Refs. [1, 4, 5]. Thus, we give here only a brief outline for a better understanding of the

results presented in the next sections.

In the geometrical model of [7], the SM arises from a rotational oscillations of valence

electrons versus the ions, both assumed to form distinct spheroids (see left part of Fig. 1).

Following the alternative view of [1] (right part of Fig. 1, the displacement ﬁeld of the mode

is a sum of the rigid rotation and a quadrupole term (the latter provides vanishing velocity

of electrons at the surface):

u(r) = Ω × r + δ2(1 + δ2/3)−1∇(yz)

(1)

where δ2 is the quadrupole deformation parameter (to be deﬁned in the next section). In

axially symmetric systems, the SM is generated by the orbital momentum ﬁelds Lx and

Ly perpendicular to the symmetry axis z, and it is characterized by the quantum numbers
|Λπ = 1+ > where Λ is the eigenvalue of Lz and π is the space parity. Energy and magnetic

strength of the mode can be estimated macroscopically [1, 4]:

where Ne is the number of valence electrons and rs the Wigner-Seitz radius. We use here

natural units me = ¯h = c = 1. The value B(M1) stands for summed strength of the

degenerated x- and y-branches. The z-branch vanishes for symmetry reasons. It is worth

noting that B(M1) does not depend on rs and so is the same for diﬀerent metals.

4

The microscopic treatment of the SM yields the shell structure of an axially deformed

mean ﬁeld. One can characterize the emerging single-electron states in terms of the quantum

numbers of the axially deformed harmonic oscillator (Clemenger-Nilsson basis). These are

the triplets ν = [N nzΛ] where nz labels the number of nodes in z-direction (=symmetry

axis) and N is the principle shell number N = nz + 2nr + Λ (from which one can derive
the number nr of radial nodes). The angular momenta orthogonal to the symmetry axis, ˆLx
and ˆLy, promote low-energy ∆N = 0 transitions inside the valence shell and high-energy

∆N = 2 transitions across two shells. Moreover, one may expand wave functions in terms

of the spherical basis (nLΛ)

Ψν=[N nzΛ] =

aν
nLRnL(r)YLΛ(Ω).

This allows to evaluate the single-particle orbital M1 transition amplitude between hole

(ν = h) and particle (ν = p) states

Eq.

(5) shows that the scissors mode is generated by Λp = Λh ± 1 transitions between

the components of one and the same spherical (nL)-level.

In spherical systems, (nLΛ)-

states belonging to the level (nL) are degenerate while in deformed systems they exhibit the

deformation splitting and so may be connected by M1 transitions with non-zero excitation

energies. This is the origin of the scissors mode. The energy scale of the scissors mode

is determined by the deformation energy splitting and so is rather small. This explains

the predominantly low-energy (∆N =0) character of the scissors mode. Just the low-energy

branch carries most of the scissors B(M1) strength (see also discussion in Section IV). The

high-energy (∆N =2) branch of the mode is much weaker since the particle states involved

into (∆N =2) transitions include only small (nL)-components from the valence shell.

III. CALCULATION SCHEME

actually the energy-density functional of [18]. The positive ionic background is modeled by

where λ = 2, 4 and ρ0(r) is the ground state density of valence electrons. The dimensionless

multipole moments βλ are less model dependent because they are computed from expec-

tation values. Thus they can serve for robust characterization of the deformation and for

comparison between diﬀerent models. The quantities δλ in the jellium model (6) coincide

with the βλ for small deformation.

The optical response is calculated in the framework of the random phase approxima-

tion (RPA). Full RPA for deformed systems is extremely involved. We employ a separable

approximation of RPA where the residual interaction is expanded into a sum of separable

terms [20]. The expansion employs local one-body operators Qλ1p(r). Their structure is

constructed as to map the response mean-ﬁeld in RPA and the generating operators (to

which response is explored) are chosen to cover the leading multipole operators. The expan-

sion coeﬃcients are computed self-consistently. It was shown that this procedure provides a

suﬃciently precise reproduction of the exact residual interaction [20]. In particular, for the

description of the SM, we use the basis of generating operators

f21p = r2+p(Y21(θ) + Y †

21(θ)),

p = 0, 2, 4,

f41p = r4+p(Y41(θ) + Y †

41(θ)),

p = 0, 2.

(9)

The same set of operators was used for the description of λµ = 21 branch of the quadrupole

plasmon [20]. The close similarity between scissors and quadrupole ﬁelds was discussed in

[4]. The p = 0 component of the input ﬁeld f210 has a form of the external quadrupole ﬁeld

in the long-wave approximation. It generates the main piece of the separable interaction,

peaked at the surface of the system. The next two quadrupole ﬁelds (p = 2 and 4) result in

the separable operators Q21p(r) peaked in more interior of the cluster. We include also hex-

adecapole ﬁelds f41p in order to account for coupling between quadrupole and hexadecapole

modes, arising with the onset of deformation, especially in systems having both quadrupole

and hexadecapole deformations. The set of the ﬁelds (9) ensures good convergence of the

separable expansion to exact results. Explicit expressions for Qλ1p(r) are given in [20].

We study the SM response in terms of photo-absorption. In axially deformed systems,

the photo-absorption cross-section from the ground state to the excited state j = Λπ of

λµ is the operator of

(in Bohr magnetons µB). The selections rules are µ = Λ and (−1)λ = π for (X = E) or
(−1)λ+1 = π for (X = M). The electric photo-absorption strength (10) will be used in

Section VII for estimation of the competition between the scissors and low-energy electric

excitations.

and S1 to the integral photo-absorption cross section. The detailed values for the Sm are

obtained from explicit RPA results. A simple estimate for S1 can be obtained using Eqs.

IV. SCISSORS RESPONSE

The M1 optical responses in light clusters are shown in Fig. 2. The present Kohn-Sham

calculations yield results close to the ones obtained by using a deformed Woods Saxon

potential [4]. Only the excitation energies in prolate clusters are ∼ 0.2 eV higher, because

of the larger quadrupole deformations obtained in the self-consistent approach. The main

characteristic of the M1 response is the occurrence of one or two prominent peaks below 1

eV. They are only slightly shifted from their unperturbed 1ph (particle-hole) spectrum. In

the low-energy region, the 1ph |Λπ = 1+ > spectrum is very dilute and, therefore, does not

meet the conditions for Landau fragmentation or for pronounced coherent superpositions.

Because of these features, the low-energy scissors strength can be associated to well deﬁned

1ph transitions.

In the Nilsson-Clemenger notation [N nzΛ], they are [110] → [101] in

11, [211] → [202] and [211] → [200] in Na+

Na+
[321] → [312] in Na+

27, [310] → [321] and [312] → [321] in Na+
35.

As shown in Fig. 2 (compare full and dashed lines), the residual interaction induces a

rather moderate blue-shift that is much smaller than e.g. the shift for the electric dipole

plasmon. The underlying physics is explained in Fig. 3 where the exchange-correlations and

Coulomb contributions to the leading part of the separable operator Q211(r) are presented
for the case of Na+

19 (the repulsive Coulomb is negative in this representation). It is seen

that both contributions compensate each other to a large extent. The ﬁnal outcome is a

slight repulsive interaction responsible for the blueshift. It is worth noting that the balance

between these two contributions is rather fragile and can be aﬀected by diﬀerent factors, e.g.

triaxiality and detailed ionic structure, making even the sign of the net interaction uncertain

[5].

Table II collects summed scissors strengths in wide- (0-6 eV) and low-energy (0-1 eV)

regions, calculated within the SRPA. It is seen that the ∆N = 0 low-energy scissors mode,

being mainly concentrated below 1 eV, contributes strongly to S−1 and S0. This justiﬁes

9

using S−1 and S0 for a rough estimation of the energy of the mode as ω =

S1/S−1 (or

ω = S1/S0). Besides, since S−1 is proportional to the paramagnetic susceptibility, this

p

means that just the low-energy SM determines the van Vleck paramagnetism (see discussion

in Section VI). The high-energy part of the scissors strength (associated with ∆N = 2

transitions) contributes appreciably to the S1 sum rule, i.e. to the total photo-absorption

cross section. Table II also shows that the increase of the Sm with cluster size is not

monotonous. The ﬂuctuations are caused by the predominantly 1ph character of the low-
energy SM and by the diﬀerence in cluster deformations. Na+

(see, e.g. [9, 27]).

stronger there.

The coupling of the SM with dipole and spin-dipole oscillations in clusters was discussed

in detail in Ref.

[5]. In particular, it was shown that breaking the symmetry by the ionic

lattice results in a weak coupling between these oscillations of opposite space parity. This

feature may change for clusters deposited on a surface since symmetry breaking is much

V. EFFECTS OF SHAPE ISOMERS AND IONIC STRUCTURE

The calculations [20, 22] show that light axially deformed clusters (Ne < 40) have at

the deformation-energy surface one distinct minimum corresponding to the ground-state

deformation. The heavier clusters (40 < Ne < 100 ) have usually two minima with opposite

quadrupole deformations (prolate and oblate) and very close energies. The energy diﬀerence

between the ground and the shape isomeric states is often less than 0.02 eV = 200 K. The

number of shape isomers with a tiny energy deﬁcit increases with cluster size. These isomers

may have a variety of very diﬀerent shapes. And signiﬁcant amounts of isomers can be found

in a thermal ensemblse and thus contribute to the SM, e.g., at room temperature.

Fig. 5 compares the scissors modes built on the ground and isomeric states in Na55

+.

Both of them show a rich spectrum of low lying M1 states. But the spectra and typical

10

strengths of the two states diﬀer substantially.

Indeed, the M1 spectra are generated by

several 1ph M1 transitions between the levels lying in the vicinity of the Fermi surface.

Prolate and oblate shapes yield diﬀerent sequences of the single-particle levels just at the

Fermi surface. As a result, some of the 1ph M1 transitions which are signiﬁcant in the prolate

case are transformed to 1pp or 1hh transitions in the oblate case, thus strongly decreasing

the strength.

Fig. 5 compares also the SRPA results obtained with soft jellium model (6) and detailed

ionic structure [5]. In the case of the ionic structure, the global cluster deformations slightly

deviate from those in the jellium case. It is seen that calculations with the ionic structure

give somewhat diﬀerent positions of the SM peaks with respect to the jellium case. Such

a redistribution of the peaks is due to diﬀerent energies of the single-particle levels in the

ionic calculations. The photo-absorption response in the ionic case is stronger, which is also

explained by the redistribution of the levels in the mean ﬁeld. The level sequence in this

case favors a few more 1ph transitions of M1 type.

Altogether, the calculations demonstrate some important points concerning the SM in

medium clusters:

i) The mode is distributed over several 1ph transitions.

ii) The single particle spectrum near the Fermi level is rather dense and so even small changes

in the calculation scheme can redistribute visibly the spectrum and open (or close) some

relevant 1ph transitions.

iii) As was mentioned above, the ground and ﬁrst isomeric states in medium clusters can

be very close in energy. So, the scissors mode in free medium clusters should be considered

as a statistical mixture of contributions from diﬀerent shapes (predominantly of the ground

state and ﬁrst isomer). Such kind of the analysis (involving the deformation splitting,

Landau fragmentation and contributions of shape isomers) was recently applied to explain

experimental E1 optical response in deformed sodium clusters with 50 < Ne < 60 [22].

Less ambiguous deformations will be provided by the SM in metal clusters deposited on

insulating substrates [28]. These clusters are oblate and their mean size and magnitude of

the deformation can be well controlled. Such clusters seem to be the most promising systems

for experimental search of the SM.

11

VI. MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY

RPA calculations show that the SM energies and B(M1) strengths scale with the defor-

mation δ2 and the electron number Ne basically according to the trends (2) and (4). Strong

ﬂuctuations, however, take place in small clusters [4]. They reﬂect the 1ph nature of the

transitions and may aﬀect the magnetic susceptibility.

The total orbital magnetic susceptibility in clusters is the sum of Langevin diamagnetic

and van Vleck paramagnetic terms [1, 2]:

27 are suﬃciently large to allow for a measurement of the dia-para anisotropy.
The observation of this eﬀect would provide a strong (though indirect) evidence of the SM

in clusters.

VII. EXPERIMENTAL PERSPECTIVES

A. General analysis

As was mentioned in the Introduction, the SM is not yet observed experimentally in

metal clusters. The search of the SM is hindered by several factors:

1) The mode has very low photo-absorption cross section. Following our results, in sodium
clusters with Ne ≃ 10 − 102 , σ(M1)/Ne ≃ 10−5 − 10−7˚A2 as compared to σ(E1)/Ne ≃ 2˚A2

for the dipole plasmon. Such a weak M1 signal is at the edge of the sensitivity of modern

detectors.

2) Eqs. (10)-(13) allow to estimate the ratios for maximal optical responses as

σ(E1)/σ(M1) = 0.35 · 105˚A−2(

)2

and (for ωE2 ≃ 3 eV [19, 20])

σ(E2)/σ(M1) = 0.82 · 10−2˚A−4(

This gives for deformed (δ2 = 0.2) sodium (rs = 2.1˚A) clusters σ(E1)/σ(M1) ≃ 4 · 106 and
σ(E2)/σ(M1) ≃ 102 (the latter for Ne = 125). So, the SM suﬀers from the competition

with E1 and E2 strengths. Besides, the competition with E2 increases with cluster size. The

above estimates compare the SM optical response with the maximal responses of E1 and

E2 plasmons. As is shown in the next subsection, the competition is much weaker in the

low-energy region where the SM has its stronghold, but one has still to be aware of large

amounts of E1 strength.

for a visible light are not eﬃcient enough.

∼ 0.1eV , in very big clusters.

4) The SM energy decreases with cluster size and reaches the region of phonon excitations,

In spite of these hindrances, clusters oﬀer enough opportunities to look for the optimal

conditions for observing the SM: one may change cluster size and (or) deformation, use

diﬀerent metals, choose between free and supported clusters, etc.. The macroscopic estimates

(2)-(4) and the present jellium RPA calculations may serve as a guide. Such analysis is brieﬂy

given below. To this purpose, we consider, as a typical case, sodium clusters with a moderate

deformation δ2 = 0.2.

Larger clusters help because the M1 photo-absorption cross section grows linearly with

the size. Already in deformed clusters with Ne = 104 − 106 the scissors signal should be

detectable. Unfortunately, the corresponding energy ω ≃ 0.1 − 0.01 eV approaches or even

covers the region of phonon excitations. Thus the best compromise for free sodium clusters is

achieved at Ne ∼ 103. Besides that, these clusters are large enough to ensure the dominance

of the orbital scissors mode over spin M1 excitations.

We may also look for clusters of larger density and deformation to increase the energy
and the strength of the mode. For example, Li clusters (rs = 1.7 ˚A) allow to increase both
the energy and optical response by a factor of ∼ 1.5 with respect to Na (rs = 2.1 ˚A). Further
improvement may be achieved with Ag (rs = 1.6 ˚A), Mg (rs = 1.4 ˚A), or Al (rs = 1.1 ˚A).
In any case, highly deformed clusters are welcome because σ(M1) ∼ δ2

2 and ω ∼ δ2.

In general, free clusters seem not suitable for observing the SM. They are well mass-

separated only up to sizes of hundred atoms. However, these systems have a weak M1

signal. As for heavier clusters, they suﬀer from a poor mass separation and are expected

to be weakly deformed [26]. Moreover, as was discussed in Section V, their M1 signal is a

statistical mix of contributions of diﬀerent shapes given by the ground state and isomers.

Deposited clusters look more promising. One can adopt techniques that allow to get

oblate clusters (Na and Ag) on dielectric surfaces [28] and, more remarkably, to monitor

their size and deformation. Clusters with 102 − 106 atoms can be used for this aim. In this

way, one can obtain supported clusters of a desired size and shape. High density of clusters

on the surface gives good statistics in the measurements. Last but not least, monitoring

the shape of clusters gives the chance to use the trends σ(M1) ∼ δ2

2 and ωM 1 ∼ δ2 to

14

distinguish the SM from the E1 and E2 signals. To this end, one has to irradiate clusters of

the same size but of diﬀerent deformations. Then the low-energy E1 and E2 cross sections

are also aﬀected but, hopefully, in an irregular fashion (thus averaging out) or, at least, in

a way diﬀerent from the trends mentioned above. The cross sections measured at diﬀerent

deformations can be mutually subtracted to extract a small useful signal. For the analysis of

such experiments, we need accurate theoretical estimates accounting for all the main factors

and, in particular, the inﬂuence of the surface on the electric and scissors plasmons. Such

work is in progress.

The competition with E1 and E2 modes may be bypassed partly by resorting to speciﬁc

reactions and techniques capable of hindering if not suppressing the E1 and E2 channels.

We will discuss this issue for three relevant reactions: photo-absorption, resonance Raman

scattering, and inelastic electron scattering.

B. Photo-absorption

The SM lies much lower than the dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes (0.2-1.0 eV

against 2.5-3.0 eV for the dipole and 2-4 eV for the quadrupole [19, 20]). In principle, one

could exploit this energy separation to focus on the SM. However, its M1 photo-absorption

cross section is still very small as compared to the E1 strength and can be masked by the

tail of close E1 modes. This is illustrated in Fig. 7 which compares E1, E2 and M1 photo-
absorption strengths calculated within SRPA approach[20] in axially deformed Na+

119 (ground

state). The E1 strength, though extremely small compared to the dipole plasmon peak, is

still strong enough to mask the SM. The competition with the quadrupole E2 strength in
Na+

119 is negligible (though it can be stronger in heavier clusters).

The competition with the E1 channel can be decreased by using deformed (oblate) clusters

with N ≃ 103−104 atoms, supported on dielectric surfaces, and adopting infrared techniques

with polarized light. For the SM, the magnetic ﬁeld of the incoming light should be parallel

to the surface. This can be done with both s- and p-polarizations (with the electrical ﬁeld

to be perpendicular and parallel to the incident plane, respectively). The s-polarized light

under an angle ∼ 0◦ with the surface normal suppresses the µ = 0 E1 branch without

weakening the SM. The p-polarized light at angle ∼ 90◦ suppresses the µ = 1 E1 branch,

again without weakening the SM. The second variant seems to be preferable since the µ = 1

15

branch is generally stronger (see, e.g., Fig. 7.

C. Resonant Raman scattering

In resonance Raman scattering (inelastic scattering of polarized photons), the SM may be

populated through the de-excitation of the dipole plasmon excited by the incoming photon.

The diﬀerence between energies of incoming and outgoing photons gives the energy of the

mode. One must look at E1 decays, which represent the leading channel and may populate

in deformed systems M1 as well as E2 states. With respect to photo-absorption, resonance

Raman scattering has the advantage of excluding the competition with the strong E1 mode

and to work in the visible light region. An experiment of this kind was carried out in

supported Ag clusters [29]. The analysis of the data suggested, however, that the E2 rather

than the SM was populated through the E1 decay. On the other hand, it is not simple to

separate clearly the E2 from the M1 modes which are mixed in deformed systems.

D.

Inelastic electron scattering

Inelastic electron scattering is also a promising technique. At backward scattering angles,

the M1 signal should prevail over the electric ones. This property enabled the discovery of the

scissors mode in deformed atomic nuclei [8]. Polarization of the electrons provides additional

possibilities to extract the magnetic response. In nuclear physics, electrons with very high

energies (tens and hundreds MeV) are used, which favors creation of well collimated, intense

and monochromatic electron beams. Moreover, at so high energies, it is easier to enhance

the relative contribution of the transverse form factor.

The low-energy, intense and monochromatic electron beams, suitable for our purpose, as

well as the angular resolved techniques are now available [30]. To our knowledge, however,

inelastic electron scattering was used so far only to observe the dipole plasmon. Theoretical

estimates [31] show that at certain scattering angles the dipole contribution can be well

suppressed in favor of the quadrupole plasmon, which, therefore, can be observed. From

the latter analysis, we may infer that also the SM may be extracted. Indeed, in the low-

energy region the SM can be stronger excited in the photo-absorption than the E2 mode.

The analogy with atomic nuclei suggests that it should be favored even more in electron

16

scattering at backward angles.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

The scissors mode (SM) in axially deformed sodium clusters has been studied within a

self-consistent RPA approach based on the soft jellium model for the ionic background and

density-functional theory for the electrons. The calculations show that the distribution of

the low-energy scissors strength is dominated by 1ph states with only small shifts by the

residual interaction. The SM thus reﬂects almost directly the density of 1ph M1 transitions

near the Fermi surface and exhibits an extreme sensitivity to the actual deformation. The

SM is rather unambiguous in light clusters (Ne < 40) while it should be a statistical mix of

contributions from diﬀerent shapes in heavier clusters. Furthermore, the high-energy branch

of the SM in deformed systems is coupled with the quadrupole plasmon.

The calculations show that the SM determines the Van Vleck paramagnetism and results

in a strong anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility. Moreover, due to quantum shell eﬀects,
some clusters (Na+

27) demonstrate dia-para anisotropy when the axial cluster is diamagnetic

along the symmetry axis and paramagnetic along other two axes. The magnetic moments

are large enough to be measured. The experimental observation of the dia-para anisotropy,

being interesting itself, could also serve as an indirect evidence of the SM in clusters.

A general analysis of possible routes for experimental observation of the scissors mode was

done. The photo-absorption with a polarized light, inelastic electron scattering and Raman

scattering were considered. The former two reactions seem to be more promising. Moreover,

deposited clusters favor the detection of the SM. Its features need yet to be worked out in

detail. Work along that direction is in progress.

Abstract

A systematic theoretical study of stoichiometric clusters (N aI)n
up to n = 15 is performed using the ab initio Perturbed-Ion (PI)
model. The structures obtained are compared to previous pair po-
tential results, and observed diﬀerences between (N aI)n clusters and
previous ab initio results for other alkali halide clusters are discussed.
(N aI)n clusters with n up to 15 do not show yet a marked preference
for geometries which are fragments of the bulk lattice. Instead, stacks
of hexagonal rings or more open structures are obtained as ground
structures in clusters with n = 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15, indicat-
ing that convergence to bulk structure is not achieved yet at this size
range. Low lying isomers which are fragments of the crystal lattice
exist, nevertheless, for those cases. The binding energies show that
clusters with n = (4), 6, 9 and 12 molecules are specially stable. The
binding energy has been decomposed in contributions which allow for
an intuitive interpretation. Some electronic properties like ionization
potentials and electronic energy levels are also studied.

1 Introduction

The structural and electronic properties of a material depend primarily on

the state of aggregation[1]. Small clusters often present signiﬁcant physical

and chemical diﬀerences with respect to the molecule and the bulk material.

Cluster studies can provide valuable insight on the development of the prop-

erties of condensed matter from those of isolated atoms or molecules. One

important source of information about cluster properties is provided by the

abundance patterns emerging from the mass spectra. The relative intensities

of cluster peaks are interpreted as being indicative of variations in the cluster

stability with size. The measured population usually shows large drops after

some particular sizes (often the population is also a maximum at those sizes)

and those particularly stable clusters are known as ”magic clusters”. The

magic numbers have been explained by using either electronic or structural

models. For example, Van der Waals clusters Xn appear to form compact

icosahedral structures[2] which exhibit enhanced stabilities for completed lay-

ers at values of n=13,55,147,... . In contrast, the stability variations of alkali

metal clusters have been interpreted in terms of the electronic-shell model[3].

A direct experimental determination of the spatial distribution of atoms or

molecules in a cluster is a very diﬃcult task; however the knowledge of the

cluster structure is a prerequisite for a quantitative discussion of many prop-

erties. Drift tube studies, which measure the mobility of a cluster ion through

an inert buﬀer gas under the inﬂuence of a weak electric ﬁeld, provide valu-

able information about the cluster geometries[4, 5]. A theoretical study of

the most stable structures and their evolution as a function of the number of

atoms or molecules in the cluster is thus of the upmost importance for the

interpretation of the mobility experiments.

2

There are several experimental techniques for the production of small clus-

ters of alkali-halide materials: particle sputtering[6], inert-gas condensation[7]

and laser vaporization[8, 9]. In this paper we are interested in stoichiomet-
ric (NaI)n clusters. Large non-stoichiometric “ionized” (NaI)nNa+ clus-

ters have been produced and their mass spectrum analyzed by Martin and

coworkers[10]. The spectrum is characterized by a periodic structure which

has been interpreted as revealing a deﬁnite pattern of growth: those clusters

grow as cuboids (clusters with rectangular faces and n1 x n2 x n3 atoms,

where n1, n2 and n3 are the number of atoms along the three edges), and the

observed intervals between minima in the spectrum correspond to the num-

ber atoms necessary to cover one face of the cuboid. The mass spectrometry

techniques detect only ionized clusters, although one can expect that the

formation pattern of neutral (NaI)n clusters will be analogous (neutral sto-

ichiometric n1 x n2 x n3 cuboids are, however, not possible if n1, n2 and

n3 are all odd numbers). Kreisle and coworkers[11] have performed mobility
measurements for (NaI)nNa+ clusters up to n = 18.

Dieﬀenbach and Martin have calculated the lowest energy structures of

NaI clusters using pair potential models[12]. In pair potential studies for

NaCl clusters, Phillips et al.

[13] found very small diﬀerences in binding

energy between isomeric conﬁgurations of the same cluster. In order to check

if the approximations inherent in a pair potential formulation have inﬂuence

on the predicted geometries we use the ab initio Perturbed Ion (PI) model,
in which the radial relaxation of the wave functions of the Na+ and I − ions

due to the interaction with the environment is taken into account. Here

we study (NaI)n clusters up to n = 15. To our knowledge, these are the

ﬁrst ab initio calculations on such clusters. The PI model, which has been

applied to study (NaCl)n clusters in previous works[14, 15, 16], had been

3

originally developed for the study of ionic materials in the crystal phase[17].

The model is based on the Theory of Electronic Separability (TES)[18, 19]

and the restricted Hartree-Fock approximation. The quantum-mechanical

interactions between the ions are treated in the following way: since the

model assumes from the start that the cluster is built from closed shell ions,

when those ions approach and the overlap becomes important, the radial

deformation of the charge clouds is taken into account in a self-consistent

way. The directional covalent eﬀects are considered less important than the

radial deformations of the closed shell ions, and this restricts the class of

systems that can be treated.

It is also interesting to compare our results with the results for NaCl

clusters[16], previously studied by the PI model. We want to see the inﬂuence
in the present case the size diﬀerence between the I − and
of the ion size:
Na+ ions is much larger than for NaCl clusters. The paper is organized as

follows. The PI model is presented in section II. The results for the structures

and binding energies of (NaI)n clusters up to n= 15 are discussed in section

III, and the conclusions are summarized in section IV.

2 Perturbed Ion model for clusters

According to the Theory of Electronic Separability (TES)[18, 19], when the

system under study is composed of weakly interacting groups, its wave func-

tion can be expressed as an antisymmetrized product of group wave functions.

If these satisfy strong-orthogonality conditions[20, 21], the total energy is the

sum of intragroup, or net, energies and intergroup interaction energies. For

a cluster with a ﬁxed three-dimensional arrangement of the ions, we consider

each ion as a diﬀerent group. All contributions to the total cluster energy

4

from a given group, the active ion A, can be collected in the eﬀective energy

of this group

EA

ef f = EA

net +

EAS

int = EA

net + EA
int.

(1)

XS(6=A)

Here EA

net is the intragroup energy and EA

int is the energy due to the inter-
action of the ion A with all the other ions. Group wave functions can be

obtained by minimizing their eﬀective energies if strong orthogonality condi-

tions are satisﬁed among the groups. The sum of the eﬀective energies is not

equal to the total energy of the system because this sum counts twice the

intergroup energies. However, we can deﬁne an additive energy of the ion A

EA

add = EA

int = EA

and then the total energy of the system can be written

E =

add.

XA=1

The eﬀective energies can be expressed as expectation values of appro-

priate eﬀective Hamiltonians. Each ion of interest (the active ion A) will be

a group in the sense of TES. Its wave function can be described by a single

Slater determinant and this can be obtained by minimizing the expectation

by:

(7)

The diﬀerent parts of V S

ef f are the electron-nucleus, classical electron-electron
and exchange parts of the potential energy. The strong orthogonality between

the orbitals of the active ion A and those of the other ions S is included in
Hef f by means of the projection operator PS(i). For closed shell ions, this

operator can be written in the form[22]

g > (−2ǫS

g ) < φS

Xg∈S

where g runs over all occupied orbitals φg of the ion S with orbital energies

We now consider the explicit form of the eﬀective potential V S

ef f [17]. For
the closed-shell ions considered here the classical electrostatic part of this

potential is given by

V S
C (~r1) =

ρS(~r2)r−1

where ρS(~r) is the electron density of ion S. The exchange operator can be

written as the nondiagonal spectral resolution[22]

radial functions for the S ion, and a and b run over the Slater-type orbitals

of l-symmetry. A(l, ab, S) are the elements of the matrix

A = S−1KS−1

(11)

6

and S and K are the overlap and the exchange matrices for the S ion in the

{| alm, S >} basis. More details can be found in the original paper by Lua˜na

and Pueyo[17].

Finally the eﬀective energy of the active ion A is the sum of the electronic

energy of eq.(4) plus the nuclear term

EA

ef f (nucl) = −

Z AvS(| ~RA − ~RS |)

(12)

XS(6=A)

where vS(| ~RA − ~RS |) is the electrostatic potential of the S group at the
nucleus of the active A ion. This potential contains nuclear and electronic

contributions.

The practical method that we have used to apply this formulation to

alkali-halide clusters is the following one: for a given distribution of the ions

forming the cluster, we consider one of them as the active ion A (for instance,
a particular anion I −), and solve the Self-Consistent-Field equations for anion

A in the ﬁeld of the remaining ions, which are considered frozen at this stage.

The solution obtained is transferred to all the anions equivalent to anion A,

that is, to the anions which have equivalent positions in the cluster. We
take then a non equivalent I − anion (anion B) as the active ion and repeat

the same process. Evidently, since anions B are not equivalent to anions A,

the energy eigenvalues and wave functions of electrons in anions B can be

diﬀerent from those of anions A. We continue this process in the same way

until all the inequivalent anions have been exhausted. The same procedure is
then followed for the cations Na+. The process just described is a PI cycle.

We iterate the PI cycles until convergence in the total energy of the cluster

is achieved. Although for bulk NaI there are only two types of active ions
(Na+ and I −), this number is larger for (NaI)n clusters. The reason is that,
in the cluster, Na+ (and I −) ions are in several diﬀerent environments. Basis

7

sets from Clementi and Roetti[23] for the ions (5s4p(Na+) and 11s9p5d(I −))

have been used in the calculations. We have checked that this election is

the best, between all the basis sets reported by Clementi and Roetti, by

carrying out some exploratory calculations for the molecule and for (NaI)6

with diﬀerent basis sets. More precisely, we have tested the use of the basis
sets optimized for Na, Na+, I and I −. Between the four diﬀerent possible
combinations, the basis set for Na+, I − led to the lowest total energies for

the two clusters studied.

Inclusion of diﬀuse functions did not show any

substantial improvement.

3 Results.

3.1 Lowest energy structure and isomers.

In order to ﬁnd the ground state structure we have to minimize the total en-
ergy E of the cluster as a function of the positions ~Ri of all the ions. E is a
function of 3N − 6 independent variables (N is the number of ions) and min-

imizing that function in a multidimensional space in which we must search

for the absolute minimum among all the local minima is a tough problem.

A restricted search can be performed by starting with a number of reason-

able guesses for the geometry and allowing for the relaxation of those initial

geometries. As input geometries we have considered cubic structures, rings

and mixed structures, and for speciﬁc numbers of molecules we have also

considered more open structures (like the wurtzite-type for n = 7, or a trun-

cated octahedron for n = 12). All those structures are suggested by previous

works using pair-potentials[12] or ab initio methods[16]. The input geome-

tries have been optimized with respect to a few parameters. More precisely,

cuboid structures were relaxed with respect to a single parameter, the ﬁrst-

8

neighbour cation-anion distance, whereas the ring structures were optimized

with respect to two or three parameters: the cation and anion distances to

the center of the ring, and the distance between rings. However, for clusters

with 7 molecules or less, we have performed, in addition, a full relaxation of

the structures obtained in the previous step. To this end, we have used a

simplex algorithm[24], as given in reference[25]. This is a simulated annealing

recipe, which we have used with the “temperature” set to zero, resulting in

the conventional downhill simplex method. The direct use of the simulated

annealing technique would be prohibitive for our calculational resources.

The results obtained for the geometries are shown in the ﬁgure 1. The
Na+ and I − ions are represented by small and large spheres, respectively.

The most stable structure (ﬁrst isomer) for each size is shown on the left.

The other structures are the low-lying isomers obtained (isomers several eV

above the absolute minimum are not shown). In the case of clusters with 3,

4 and 5 molecules we show two diﬀerent views of the second isomer. The

total energy diﬀerence with respect to the absolute minimum is given for

each isomer. For n=2 we obtain a square as the ground state, for n=3 an

hexagonal ring, for n=4 a cube, for n=5 a cube with a molecule attached

to an edge and for n=6 an hexagonal prism. That is, we have found planar

ground state structures for n = 2 and n = 3 and three-dimensional structures

for n = 4 or larger. Planar ring-like isomers exist for n = 4 and n = 5, quite

low in energy in the second case. The cuboid isomer for n = 6 is also quite

close in energy to the hexagonal prism. The lowest energy structures for

n = 2 − 6 are, however, not perfect. The full relaxation allowed by the

calculation resulted in slightly distorted geometries. Nevertheless for n = 5

the distortion of the cube is large: the cube edge facing the extra molecule

enlarges its length. The structure for n = 5 can also be viewed as a distorted

9

(non planar) hexagon with two molecules attached, which can be justiﬁed in

view of the structure of (NaI)3. The structure obtained for n = 7 is a piece

of the wurtzite crystal.

The same trend of competition between two diﬀerent structural families

continues for n larger than 7. n = 8, 11 and 14 are cuboid structures whereas

n = 9, n = 10 and n = 15 correspond to stacks of hexagonal rings. Rather

peculiar structures are obtained for n = 12 and n = 13: a hollow cage for

n = 12 and a mixed structure (basket) for n = 13. The energy diﬀerence

between the ground state and the cuboid isomers is so small for n = 10, 13

and 15, that a more ﬂexible relaxation of the cuboid isomer could perhaps

change the order (we recall that the cuboid isomers have been relaxed with

respect to a single parameter). This is unlikely for n = 9, for which the energy

diﬀerence reported in Fig. 1 is 0.14 eV. In fact, we have performed additional

calculations for the cuboid isomer in (NaI)9 relaxing the energy with respect

to more (six) parameters, but the hexagonal isomer still remained as the

lowest energy structure.

We proceed now to compare our results with pair potential calculations[12].

In the pair potential calculations two diﬀerent models have been considered:

a rigid-ion model in which the energy is computed as a sum of the electro-

static (Coulomb) and repulsive (Born-Mayer) energies, and a polarizable-ion

model in which each ion has an induced dipole moment due to the fact that

the closed electronic shells are polarized by the electric ﬁeld of the others ions.

We ﬁnd discrepancies with respect to the rigid-ion model for n = 4, 5, 8, 11,

14. In those cases the ground state predicted by that model corresponds to

our second isomer. Those structures contain hexagonal or higher order rings.

The same type of discrepancies are found compared to the polarizable-ion

model for n = 8, 11, 14. Surprisingly, the polarizable-ion model favors the

10

defect-cuboid structure for n = 13, which is the second isomer in the PI cal-

culations, only 0.02 eV above the ground state. This suggest the possibility

of the defect-cuboid becoming the lowest energy structure in a PI calculation

with a more ﬂexible relaxation of interatomic distances.

If we now compare the results of the PI model for (NaCl)n[16] and (NaI)n

we ﬁnd a preference of the NaI clusters for more open structures, like the

stacks of hexagonal rings for n = 6, 9, 10 and 15. Our calculations show

the same general trends in ground state structures shown in other ab ini-

tio calculations when the cation size is quite smaller than the anion size.

For example, (LiF )n clusters studied in[26] showed also a marked preference

towards ring-like (open) structures. Thus, we can summarize these obser-

vations in the following way: if the ions composing the cluster have similar

sizes, or if the cations are larger than the anions, a preference for cubic struc-

tures against hexagonal prismatic forms is advanced for those speciﬁc sizes in

which both structures are feasible, as in the case of clusters with 6, 9 and 12

molecules. On the other hand, if anions are larger than cations, a preference

for hexagonal structures is advanced in the same cases. These hypothesis

deserve further and more detailed studies on other ionic materials.

The NaI crystal has the NaCl structure[1]. The conclusion from the

study of small (NaI)n clusters (n ≤ 15) is that only for some values of n the

cluster can be considered as a small piece of the bulk lattice. But there are

other sizes, notably n = 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, for which the clusters, due to

their very small sizes, prefer other structures. The magic numbers observed

in the mass spectra of large NaI clusters[10] (those clusters are, however,

ionized and non-stoichiometric) have been explained as cuboids with the

bulk structure. We conclude that the number of atoms in NaI clusters with

15 molecules or less is not yet enough to produce bulk-like clusters.

11

3.2

Inter-ionic distances

In ﬁgure 2 we present the average interionic distance d between nearest neigh-
bours Na+ and I − ions for the ground state geometry as a function of the

cluster size. d presents an irregular behaviour as a function of n, and this is

due to the changes in the type of structure. By joining the points correspond-

ing to the same type of structural family, either cubic or hexagonal, then the

variation of d is less pronounced; this is shown by the two dashed lines. The

cubic clusters have an interatomic distance larger than the hexagonal ones.
d tends to a saturation value (∼ 3.4˚A) that is higher than the distance in
the bulk (dbulk(NaI) = 3.24˚A[1]). This can perhaps be attributed to the

lack of electron correlation in the calculation. The incorporation of electron

correlation tends to shorten the distances in ionic clusters, as other ab initio

calculations[26] have shown for NaCl clusters.

3.3 Binding energies

The binding energy per molecule of the cluster with respect to the separate

free ions, is given by:

Ebind = −

[E(cluster) − nE0(I −) − nE0(Na+)]

(13)

1
n

where the energies of free Na+ and Cl− ions are - 161.67692 a.u. and -

6918.06360 a.u, respectively. Ebind is shown as a function of n in ﬁgure 3.

The trend is an increase of the binding energy with n. But superposed to

this general trend, especially stable clusters are predicted for n = (4), 6,

9, 12. The stability of those clusters is reﬂected in local peaks in Ebind (or

a pronounced change of slope for n = 4). The magic numbers agree with

those predicted earlier for (NaCl)n[16] using the PI model. From the num-

bers given in ﬁgures 1 and 3 we notice that the energy diﬀerences between

12

isomers are very small compared to the total binding energies. This observa-

tion is relevant because it indicates that the magic character of some clusters

(the peaks in ﬁg.3) is associated to the speciﬁc number of molecules in those

clusters and not to the particular structure of the lowest isomer.

In fact,

(NaCl)n clusters also have magic numbers for n = 6, 9, 12, although the

lowest energy structures are cuboids (see ﬁg.2 of ref[16]), that is, diﬀerent

from the lowest energy structures of (NaI)n. What makes special the num-

ber of molecules in the magic clusters is that “compact” clusters can be built

for those sizes. We illustrate this with speciﬁc examples. The groun state of

(NaI)5 and the hexagonal isomers of (NaI)7 contain some low coordinated

ions, in contrast to (NaI)6. Both the ground state and the cuboid isomer of

(NaI)9 are more compact than the elongated forms of (NaI)8 and (NaI)10.

Finally, the hexagonal and cubic isomers of (NaI)12 are again more compact

than the “defect” forms of (NaI)11 and (NaI)13. This idea of stability asso-

ciated to compact clusters, which is evidently associated to the optimization

of the attractive part of the electrostatic energy, provides justiﬁcation for

the interpretation of the periodic structure in the mass spectrum of large
(NaI)nNa+ clusters as revealing a cuboid pattern growth[10].

3.4 Eﬀects of the cluster size on the one-electron levels

and vertical ionization potentials.

In ﬁgures 4 and 5, the eigenvalues of the 2p orbitals of Na+ and the 5p
orbital of I − ions are plotted as a function of n. The results correspond to

the most stable structure for each cluster size. Instead of a single eigenvalue

we have a band of eigenvalues for each cluster because the cations (or anions)
occupy inequivalent positions in the cluster. In other words, the 2p (Na+)
and 5p (I −) eigenvalues are local atomic properties, and as such these could

13

determine the most reactive sites, or the preferred adsorption sites.

The binding energy of the 2p level of the Na+ ion, averaged over all the

ions in the cluster, decreases slowly with cluster size and the average binding
energy of the 5p level of the I − increases. Of course, in the inﬁnite crystal

limit all the cations are equivalent, so there will be only one 2p eigenvalue
for Na+ (and a single eigenvalue for the 5p level of I −).

The clusters under study are made up of closed shells ions, whose wave

functions are strongly localized. Thus, it can be assumed that an electron is

extracted from a speciﬁc localized orbital when the cluster is ionized. This is

the lowest bound 5p orbital, which generally corresponds to anions in corner

positions. Using a Koopmans’ like argument, we then identify the vertical

ionization potential of the cluster with the smallest binding energy of a 5p

electron. The dashed line in the ﬁgure 5 indicates the variation of the vertical

ionization potential with the cluster size.

The vertical ionization potential IP of a (NaI)n cluster in a pair potential

model is a sum of two terms: the ﬁrst is the energy necessary to remove an

electron from the isolated anion, i.e., the electronic aﬃnity EA of the neutral

halogen atom, and the second is the electrostatic interaction of the electron

removed, considered as a localized point charge, with the other ions in the

cluster, also considered unit point-like charges, that is

IP = EA +

qiqj
rij

Xj6=i

(14)

where rij is the distance between “i” and “j” sites. The electrostatic term

provides a strong stabilizing eﬀect (we note that the EA of a free I atom is

only 3.06 eV[27]). On the other hand, the short-range repulsive interaction

among the electron and the electrons of neighbouring ions has been neglected

in equation (14). This interaction, which is taken into account in the PI

14

model, tends to lower the ionization energy below the value given by equation

(14).

In order to study the diﬀerent inﬂuence of the cluster ﬁeld on cations

and anions we show in Table I the binding energy diﬀerences ∆(nl) between

the electronic levels (nl) of the ions in the cluster and in vacuum. As a

representative cluster we have chosen the lowest isomer for n = 4, relaxed

with respect the nearest-neighbour distance. The shifts ∆(1s), ∆(2s) and
∆(2p) are nearly the same for Na+, with diﬀerences in the meV range; this

constant shift is the eﬀect of the electrostatic term of equation (14). However,
the situation is diﬀerent for the I − anions, where the shifts are negative

and larger for the outermost (5s and 5p) orbitals compared to the “core”
orbitals. This is indicative of the high polarizability of the I − anion. The
distinct stabilizing eﬀects experienced by the outermost orbitals of the I −

anions compared to “core” orbitals is ascribed to the quantum terms in the

interaction energy, namely, the exchange interaction and the wave function

orthogonality.

3.5 Eﬀects of the cluster formation on the wave func-

tions. Partition of the binding energy

The PI model assumes that the electronic density is a simple superposition

of weakly overlapping spherically symmetric densities of the individual ions.
Upon formation of the cluster, the Na+ densities are practically equal to
the free-ion densities, but a contraction of the I − density is found which is

mainly due to the 5p and 5s orbitals. This is in accordance with the general

trends for ionic solids[17].

The orbital contraction of the outermost I − orbitals increases with the

cluster size, and is diﬀerent for non equivalent anions. To get a more quan-

15

titative picture of this eﬀect we proceed to study its inﬂuence on the cluster

energy. The cluster binding energy of equation (13) can be written in a

convenient form to our purposes using the equations (1) and (3):

Ebind = −

According to this equation, we can separate the cluster binding energy into

a sum of cationic and anionic contributions, each one composed in turn of
two terms: one of them, EA

def , accounts for the energy associated to the de-
formation of the ionic wave functions and the other is half of the interaction
energy of that ion. The ﬁrst term, EA
have to recall that EA

def , can never be negative: we just
O are the expectation values of the intra-ionic
part of the hamiltonian in states corresponding to the perturbed and the

net and EA

free ion, respectively. Since the last one minimizes that expectation value,
we have EA

O. Thus, the deformation energy is always an unfavourable
contribution to the cohesion. In contrast, the interaction energy term, is neg-

net > EA

ative. The deformation and interaction parts of cationic and anionic binding

energies are given in Table II for clusters with n = 1-9. P indicates the

16

speciﬁc type of site when there are several non equivalent positions. For

n ≤ 7, where we have made a “full optimization” of the structures, average

values are quoted. We notice the passive cationic response to the cluster en-

vironment, the corresponding deformation energies being negligible. Instead,

there are sizable anionic deformation energies (up to 0.5 eV). The table dis-

tinguishes diﬀerences between ions in vertex (V) and in edge (E) positions.

The deformation energies are smaller for anions in vertex positions by 0.2

eV . This is related to the lower coordination for ions in vertex positions.

However, in all cases, the anionic interaction energies are larger, in absolute

value, than the corresponding deformation energies and their sum is always

negative. Another interesting aspect is that we have at our disposal the

binding energies of the ions at all nonequivalent positions in the cluster.

The binding energies in ﬁgure 3 grow quite fast with n, but the limited

size range studied here is not enough to estimate precisely the limiting value.

That limit seems to be a little smaller than the experimental binding en-

ergy in the bulk crystal (7.05 eV/molecule[1]). Our theoretical value for the

molecule is also smaller than the experimental one. Three factors can con-

tribute to those errors.

In the ﬁrst place, the geometries for n > 7 have

not been fully optimized. Second, there is an intrinsic variational restric-

tion in the PI method, which is associated to the neglect of covalent mixing

between anionic and cationic wave functions. And third, we have neglected

the coulomb electronic correlation. We think that the main source of error

is the last one, in line with the arguments leading to the same conclusion in

alkali halide solids[17]. Although it is sometimes stated that the HF approx-

imation would give good binding energies for ionic compounds because the

correlation errors in the free-ion and cluster wave functions tend to cancel

out, the orbital anionic deformation upon cluster formation casts doubts on

17

this assumption.

4 Conclusions

(NaI)n clusters up to n = 15 have been studied using the ab initio Perturbed

Ion (PI) model. Geometries have been “fully” relaxed only for n ≤ 7, due to

the increasing computational time necessary to carry out these optimizations

in larger clusters. The isomeric study shows that these clusters are not

yet fragments of the bulk crystal lattice, although lattice fragments occur

indeed for some values of n. Comparison to pair potential models shows some

discrepancies.

Interionic distances do not show a smooth variation unless

we restrict ourselves to a ﬁxed geometrical family. Though extrapolation

to very large cluster sizes is diﬃcult, we think that inclusion of correlation

eﬀects would be important in order to obtain quantitative agreement with

bulk quantities. Particularly stable (“magic”) clusters have been obtained

for n = (4), 6, 9 and 12.

Cationic electron densities remain nearly undisturbed upon formation of

the cluster. On the contrary, anionic densities are contracted in this process.

The orbitals aﬀected have been identiﬁed as the outermost ones, mainly
the 5p orbital of I −. Nevertheless the 5s orbital also experiments some

deformation, and should not be considered as a “core” orbital in a self-

consistent-ﬁeld calculation. This eﬀect has been analyzed by performing a

study of the energy eigenvalues. In the PI model, the binding mechanism

is a combination of the orbital deformation and the quantum mechanical

interaction between each ion and the cluster, and the cluster binding energies

have been analyzed from the point of view of this bonding mechanism.

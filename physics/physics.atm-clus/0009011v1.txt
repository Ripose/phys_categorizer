The energetic characteristics of two-shell carbon nanoparticles (”onions”) with diﬀerent shapes
of second shell are calculated. The barriers of relative rotation of shells are found to be surprisingly
small therefore free relative rotation of shells can take place at room temperature. The intershell
orientational melting of the nanoparticle is studied by molecular dynamics. The parameters of
Arrhenius formula for jump rotational intershell diﬀusion are calculated. The rotation of shells can
be observed beginning from temperature 70 K.

I. INTRODUCTION

The discovery of fullerenes [1] and the elaboration of method of their production in arc discharge [2] gives rise the
interest to another carbon nanostructures produced in arc discharge, in particular, nanoparticles with shell structure
[3]. A set of works is devoted to their structure and energetics [4]– [12]. Nevertheless, an attention has not yet been
given to thermodynamical properties of carbon nanoparticles with shell structure. The melting of single cluster can
essentially diﬀer from phase transitions in macroscopic systems [13]- [19]. Particularly, the melting of a mesoscopic
cluster with shell structure can manifest itself as an hierarchy of rearrangements with breaking intershell orientational
order and then breaking shell structure and order in particles positions inside shells. E.g., in 2D mesoscopic clusters
with Coulomb [13]- [16], screened Coulomb [17], logarithmic [18] and dipole [19] interaction between particles the
orientational melting (breaking the orientational order between the shells) precedes melting inside the shells.

The van der Waals interaction between atoms of neighbour shells in carbon nanoparticles is considerably weaker
than chemical bonds between atoms inside the shell. So it is naturally that these nanoparticles are possible candidates
for orientational melting [4]. The possibility of orientational melting of long two-shell carbon nanotube was discussed
[20]. The orientational melting in carbon nanotube bundle was also theoretically studied [21].

The orientational melting can be considered as a two stage phenomenon. At low temperatures the relative orien-
tations of shells are freezed. The intershell reorientations begin with increasing of temperature. For low temperature
these reorientations occur as jumps between ﬁxed relative shell orientations corresponding to minima of nanoparticle
energy (jump rotational diﬀusion). For high temperature free rotation of shells take place.
In the present paper
the zero temperature energetic characteristics of two-shell carbon nanoparticle C60@C240 are calculated. The ob-
tained values for barriers of relative rotations of shells are small enough to free rotation of shells take place at room
temperature. The orientational melting of this nanoparticle is studied here by molecular dynamics technique.

II. SIMULATION DETAILS

The following reasons have determined our choice of nanoparticle shells. The TEM images shows that the inner
shell of carbon nanoparticle can have a size that is close to the size of fullerene C60 [22,23]. The fullerene C60 with Ih
symmetry is the smallest fullerene without adjacent pentagons in its structure. Fullerenes smaller than C60 can not
be directly extracted by the use of any solvent from soot, obtained in arc discharge (see, for example, [24,25]). To
explain this fact it was proposed that atoms of fullerenes which belong to two adjacent pentagons can have chemical
bonds with neighbor fullerenes in soot [27]. For example, chemical bonds between all neighbour fullerenes are present
in solid C36 [29]. Therefore we consider C60 as the smallest inner shell where the absence of chemical bonds between
shells is very probable (it is a necessary condition for existence of relative rotation of shells). Used single and double
bonds lengths of C60 are 1.391 ˚A and 1.455 ˚A, respectively [30]. We accept the fullerene C240 with Ih symmetry as
outer shell of nanoparticle. This model gives the distance between shells in agreement with experiment [23] being
close to the distance between graphite planes. Besides the fullerene C240 with Ih symmetry have greater binding
energy than fullerenes C240 with other structures [6]. Several sets of geometric parameters corresponding to diﬀerent
shapes of fullerene C240 obtained by ab initio calculations of minima of binding energy [4,7,8] are used. Diﬀerent shell

shapes B, C, D and E were found by optimization of all independent geometric parameters of fullerene C240 with Ih
symmetry. The shapes B and D corresponding to global and local minima found by York et al [7] that are close to
sphere and truncated icosahedron respectively. The shape E corresponds to the single minimum found by Osawa [4].
It is intermediate between shapes B and D. The shape C is rather close to shapes E. It corresponds to the minimum
found by Scuceria [8]. The shape A is obtained by optimization of less number of independent geometric parameters
so that all atoms of this shape are arranged on the sphere [7].

We describe the interaction between atoms of neighbour shells by Lennard-Jones potential U = 4ǫ((σ/r12)− (σ/r)6)
with parameters ǫ = 28 K and σ = 3.4 ˚A. These parameters were used for the simulation of solid C60 [31]. The
interaction between atoms inside shells we describe by Born potential:

where ui, uj are displacements of atoms from equilibrium positions, rij are distances between atoms. We take
α = 1.14 · 103 N/m and β = 1.24 · 102 N/m. Born potential with these values of force constants gives adequate internal
vibrational spectrum of C60 [32]. Born potential is correct only near the bottom of potential well. Nevertheless we
believe that this potential is adequate for our simulation because we use it at temperatures that are one-two order of
magnitude less than the temperature of fullerene destruction.

The orientational melting of nanoparticle C60@C240 with shape D of C240 we studied by molecular dynamics
technique. The simulations are performed in microcanonical ensemble. The equations of motion were integrated
using the leap frog algorithm. We used the integration step τ = 6.1 · 10−16 s (about one hundred steps for period of
atoms vibration inside shells). Initially the system has been brought to the equilibrium during 300-500 ps that is about
30–50 librations of shells. The average ﬂuctuations of the total energy and temperature of the system fall and ﬂatten
out during this period. Then the system was studied during 100 ps. The average ﬂuctuations of the total energy of
the system were within 0.3 % and the average ﬂuctuations of temperature were within 1.3 %. The angular velocities
of shells change rather slowly. Therefore all investigated quantities were averaged over 34-46 diﬀerent realizations of
the systems at the same temperature but with diﬀerent energies accounting for relative rotation of shells (i.e. with
diﬀerent random angular velocities of shells).

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Ground state energetics

The global and local minima of total nanoparticle energy are found by optimization of three angles of their relative
orientation. The total energy of nanoparticle includes the energy of interaction between shells and energy of shell
deformation. We describe the relative orientations corresponding to minima of total energy in terms of three angles
αz, αy and αx of subsequent rotations of ﬁrst shell around axes OZ, OY and OX of coordinate system. The centers
of both shells coincide with the center of coordinate system. The angles αz, αy and αx were measured from the
initial orientation shown on Fig. 1. Due to the high Ih symmetry of shells the number of any equivalent minima
(global or local) is 60. Such equivalent minima correspond to diﬀerent relative orientations of shells. The energies
of interaction between shells and angles of one of the orientations corresponding to global and local minima of total
energy of nanoparticle are listed in Table 1.

The energies of interaction between shells calculated here are slightly less than 16.9 [9], 18.57 [10] and 20.3 [9]
meV/atom obtained using another representations of van der Waals interaction and are about three times less than
estimation 65.3 meV/atom for graphite [33]. Note, that the energy of total interaction between shells is not maximal
for perfect sphere in comparison with other shapes of C240 contrary to the assumption of Lu and Yang [10].

We observed that the angles of orientations corresponding to global and local minima are determined by the shape
of second shell. For the shapes C, D and E of C240 the initial relative orientation of shells (where symmetry axis of
shells coincide) corresponds to global minima of total nanoparticle energy (note, that all these shapes of C240 are close
to the truncated icosahedron). Several global minima for shape D are shown on Fig. 2a. One type of local minima is
found for these shapes of C240. For the shape B (which is close to sphere) orientations with coinciding symmetry axes
correspond only to local minima (see Fig 2b). No minima correspond to such orientations for the ”spherical” shape
A. For ”spherical” shape of C240 two types of local minima are found. The diﬀerences ∆Eloc in total nanoparticle
energies between global and local minima are very small and also determined by the shape of second shell (see Table
2). These diﬀerences decrease with decreasing the average deviation < ∆Ri2 >=< |Ri2− < Ri2 > | of second shell
from perfect sphere, where Ri2 is the distance between an atom of second shell and the center of nanoparticle. The

2

diﬀerences ∆Eloc also decrease when the average distance between shells h =< Ri2 > − < Ri1 > approaches to the
distance rmin corresponding to the minimum in pair interatomic potential. This fact can be explained as follows: the
change of distance d12 between two atoms of neighbour shells causes the less change of interaction energy between
these atoms for the distances d12 corresponding to the bottom of interatomic potential well in comparison with the
distances d12 corresponding to the walls of this well.

The calculated energies of shell deformation are presented in Table 2. The inﬂuence of shell deformation on the
barriers of relative rotation of shells is studied as an example for barriers B5 of shell rotation around ﬁfth order axes
of symmetry. (Barriers B5 was calculated for the relative orientation where symmetry axes of shells have the same
directions). The comparison of barriers B5 calculated with taking into account shell deformation and without it gives
the diﬀerence less than 1 % for all ﬁve shapes of C240 investigated here (Note that the barrier B5 calculated here for
the shape E of C240 is 12 % less than that obtained by Osawa used the tandem of molecular orbital and molecular
mechanics calculations [4]). Therefore the shell deformations are disregarded here in calculation of barriers of relative
rotation of shells, i.e. lengths of bonds angles between bonds inside shells are supposed to be ﬁxed during intershell
rotation. Note, that opposite situation take place e.g. for clusters with logarithmic interaction between particles [18].
In this case the interparticle interactions inside shell and between shells are the same and therefore the considering
of shells deformation is necessary in calculation of barriers for rotation. The relative displacement of the centres of
symmetry of shells causes an increase in intershell interaction energy. Therefore the common center of symmetry of
both shells also supposed to be ﬁxed during rotation.

The barriers of relative rotation of shells in the nanoparticles under consideration are calculated for relative orien-
tations corresponding to global minima of total nanoparticle energies. It is found that the obtained values of barriers
for rotation are surprisingly small (see Table 2). Magnitudes of these barriers are very sensitive to the shape of C240
and decrease when < ∆Ri2 >→ 0 and h → rmin (analogously to the diﬀerences ∆Eloc in interaction energies between
global and local minima). Moreover, these barriers are only several times greater than barriers Ba in dependencies
of interaction energy between only one atom of the second shell and the whole ﬁrst shell vs. angle of rotation. For
example, for the nanoparticle with shape D of C240 the barrier for rotation around ﬁfth order axis is 158.8 K. Simul-
taneously the maximal barrier among the barriers Ba for diﬀerent atoms of the second shell is 21.6 K. The detailed
analysis shows that maxima of barriers Ba for individual atoms in the same shell corresponds to diﬀerent angles of
rotation and so the dependence of total energy on angle of rotation is essentially smoothed (see Fig. 3). Note, that
the using of spherical shape of C240 leads to signiﬁcant underestimation of barriers for rotation.

The radii of shells of nanoparticle C60@C240 are very close to radii of shells of (5,5)@(10,10) two-shell carbon
nanotube. It is interest that barriers for relative rotation of shells per one atom calculated here for all considered
nanoparticles are order of magnitude less than appropriate barrier in (5,5)@(10,10) two-shell carbon nanotube calcu-
lated by Kwon and Tomanek [20].

B. Molecular dynamics simulation

We have investigated by molecular dynamics technique the angular velocity autocorrelation function of shells, the
spectrum of shell librations, the frequency of shell reorientations, distributions of Eiler angles of relative orientations
of shells and heat capacity of nanoparticle.

The dependence of total energy on temperature is used to calculate the heat capacity of nanoparticle. In investigated
temperature region 30 − 150 K the heat capacity per one degree of freedom has no diﬀerence from the heat capacity
of harmonic oscillator system within the accuracy of calculation that is less than 5 %. Only three degrees of freedom
accounted for relative orientation of shells. Therefore as was to be expected there is not any peculiarities in the
dependency of heat capacity on temperature and the orientational melting of two-shell carbon nanoparticle has a
crossover behavior: the free rotation of shells observed in few realizations of the system at temperature 70 K and in
a half realizations of the system at temperature 140 K.

The dependence of shells reorientation frequency ν vs. temperature T is shown on Fig. 4. The jump orientational
intershell diﬀusion takes place where kT ≪ Bre, Bre is an eﬀective energy barrier of reorientation. The reorientation
frequency ν for jump orientational intershell diﬀusion we interpolate at temperatures 30 − 100 K by the Arrhenius
formula (thick line on Fig. 4):

ν = Ω0 exp(cid:18)−

Bre

kT (cid:19) ,

(2)

where Ω0 is a frequency multiplier. The ﬁtting by least square technique gives Bre = 167 ± 22 Kelvin degrees and
Ω0 = 540 ± 180 ns−1. The using of shorter temperature range T = 30 − 75 K for interpolation is found to have only
a slight inﬂuence on calculated parameters Bre and Ω0.

3

The exponential increase of reorientation frequency ν ends at temperatures 100 − 150 and this shows the beginning
of free rotation of shells. It can be shown that the reorientation frequency ν at temperature T ≫ Bre can be estimated
by the expression

ν =

n

2πs 3kT (I1 + I2)

I1I2

(3)

where n is an average number of reorientations over the period of relative shell rotation (n ≈ 5), I1 and I2 are moments
of inertia of 1-st and 2-nd shells respectively. The dependence of reorientation frequency on temperature deﬁned by
Eq. (3) is shown on Fig. 4 by thin line.

The prominent smooth of distributions of Eiler angles of relative orientations of shells (Fig. 5), the disappearance
of maxima in the angular velocity autocorrelation function of shells (Fig. 6) and in the spectrum of shell librations
(Fig. 7) conﬁrm that the free rotation of shells determines the thermodynamical behaviour of the nanoparticle at
temperatures greater than 140 .

Thus it is found that process of orientational melting for the two-shell nanoparticle occurs at temperatures that
are at least 10 times less than the temperature of total melting. Analogeously orientational melting can occur also in
many-shell nanoparticles and short many shell nanotubes [34]. As we have shown the barriers for rotation are very
sensitive to the shape of shells. Therefore, the realization of possible rotational melting in many-shell nanoparticles
is determined by their shape. The nanoparticles obtained in arc discharge are faceted in shape [3,35]. However,
they change their shape to almost spherical one when they are subjected to very strong electron irradiation in a
high-resolution electron microscope [23,33,36]. The accurate ab initio calculation of geometric parameters of large
shells are necessary for performance of theoretical studies of possible orientational melting of many-shell nanoparticles.
Nevertheless, the theory does not provide accurate coordinates. Some works predict that many-shell nanoparticles
are faceted [6,9] and some that they are spherical [10,12]. The calculations also shown that the faceted nanoparticles
transform to spherical under high temperature [9,11]. Therefore the barriers for rotation may decrease with increasing
of temperature due to change of shell structure.

The carbon nanoparticles with shell structure are not the single example of diﬀerent types of atom interaction
inside shell and between shells. A two-shell spherical nanoparticle from M oS2 was produced [12]. We believe that
orientational melting can also take place in nanoparticles from this material.

The orientational melting in a single nanoparticle may be revealed by IR or Raman study of the temperature depen-
dence of width of spectral lines. The last must have Arrhenius-like contribution in reorientational phase (analogously
to the behavior in plastic crystals, see, e.g., [37] and references herein). Moreover this study can give the estimation
of reorientational barriers. Besides NMR line narrowing can be observed in reorientational phase.

corresponding to all 25 groups of atoms with diﬀerent dependencies Ea for individual atom are shown by thin lines
(23 groups from 10 atoms and 2 groups from 5 atoms). The dependence of total interaction energy between shells on
angle αz is shown by bold line. All energies are measured from their minima.

Fig. 4 The dependence of shells reorientation frequency ν on temperature T in Kelvin degrees. The interpolation

by the Arrhenius formula at T < Bre is shown by thick line. The estimation at T > Bre is shown by thin line.

Fig. 5 The distributions of Eiler angles θ, ψ and φ of relative orientations of shells at temperatures 21 K, 36 K
and 140 K are shown by dotted lines, thin lines and thick lines respectively; a) the distribution of angle φ; b) the
distribution of angle θ; c) the distribution of angle ψ.

Fig. 6 The angular velocity of autocorrelation function of the ﬁrst shell at temperatures 21 K, 36 K and 140 K

are shown by dotted lines, thin lines and thick lines respectively.

Fig. 7 The spectrum of shell librations at temperatures 21 K, 36 K and 140 K are shown by dotted lines, thin

lines and thick lines respectively.

The discovery of long bonds in gold atom chains has represented a challenge for physical interpre-
tation. In fact, interatomic distances frequently attain 3.0-3.6 ˚A values and, distances as large as 5.0
˚A may be seldom observed. Here, we studied gold chains by transmission electron microscopy and
performed theoretical calculations using cluster ab initio density functional formalism. We show
that the insertion of two carbon atoms is required to account for the longest bonds, while distances
above 3 ˚A may be due to a mixture of clean and one C atom contaminated bonds.

In the last years considerable interest has been de-
voted to the study of linear gold atom chains (LAC)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The invention and reﬁnement of
experimental techniques such as scanning tunneling mi-
croscope (STM) [1, 8, 9, 10], high resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) [4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
and mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ)
[14, 16, 17] have made possible the fabrication of such
atomic size contacts. As the LACs are in atomic scale,
quantization of the conductance has been therefore ob-
served (see recent review in [18]).

A surprising fact has been the observation of large
bonds between gold atoms in stable monoatomic gold
chains with respect to the normal nearest-neighbor dis-
tances in gold bulk (2.88 ˚A), or in Au2 dimers (2.5 ˚A)
[19]. It has been reported [3, 4, 5, 14, 20] that interatomic
distances frequently vary in the 2.9 - 3.6 ˚A range and also,
extremely long distances close to 5 ˚A have been rarely ob-
served [15]. The origin of these large distances has been
a serious and unresolved challenge for theoretical inter-
pretation. Many theoretical studies have been reported
using diﬀerent techniques [6, 19, 21, 22] such as molecular
dynamics and density functional theory (DFT). However,
none of these works were able to reproduce the observed
large interatomic distances. The chain rupture is always
observed for distances signiﬁcantly below the experimen-
tal values.

Neither of these theoretical works have considered the
possibility of the monoatomic chains being contaminated
by some impurities [4, 5, 14, 15] during sample fabrica-
tion. We have decided to explore this possibility, in spe-
cial considering carbon atom contamination that, from
experimental conditions, are most likely spurious atoms
during HRTEM observations [5, 14]. As recently demon-
strated, the presence of carbon atoms would be unde-
tectable (because of the low contrast) in HRTEM images

and would appear as large unusual Au-Au distances [15].
In this paper we investigate both experimentally and
theoretically the formation of suspended gold chains, ad-
dressing the calculations to analyze the origin of the large
inter-gold distances experimentally observed.

We have generated stable linear gold atom chains in
situ in a HRTEM (JEM 3010 URP, 300 kV, 1.7 ˚A resol.,
at LME/LNLS Campinas, Brazil) following the method
developed by Kondo and Takanayagi [13]. This proce-
dure is based on using electron-beam irradiation (current
density of 100 A/cm2) to drill holes at diﬀerent sites of a
self-supported gold thin ﬁlm (5 nm thick, average grain
size 50-100 nm) until a nanometric neck is formed be-
tween neighboring holes; the electron beam intensity is
then reduced (∼30 A/cm2) in order to perform the image
acquisition. This experimental approach has been care-
fully described elsewhere [23]. The presented images were
acquired from real time recording using a high sensitiv-
ity TV camera (Gatan 622SC) coupled to a conventional
video recorder.

In order to try to understand the origin of the un-

usual large Au-Au interatomic distances molecular clus-
ters were used to simulate LACs. The geometry op-
timization calculations were performed using ab initio
density functional total energy methods. We have used
DMOL [24] and TITAN [25] packages. The density func-
tional is treated by local density approximation with a
Wang-Perdew [26] (Vosko-Wilk-Nusair) [27] exchange-
correlation functional for DMOL (TITAN) case. For the
computation, we have used a double numerical (DND)
basis set together with polarization functions for DMOL,
and a LACVP∗∗ basis set in the case of TITAN. The
reliability and the method dependence of the predicted
geometries were tested carrying out a comparative study
for the dimeric interdistance. As we can see from Fig.
1, the qualitative features are almost the same and the
minimum predicted distance (2.44 ˚A for DMOL, and 2.49
˚A for TITAN calculations) are in very good agreement
with the experimental value of 2.47 ˚A [28, 29].

In Fig. 2 we show a series of snapshots of the elon-
gation of a gold nanowire. After forming a one-atom-
thick constriction in Fig. 2b, further stretching induces
the generation of an LAC consisting of three hanging
atoms (Fig. 2(c)); ﬁnally, the constriction breaks and
the apexes retract (Fig. 2(d)). This atom chain has been
chosen because it displays a high contrast and also a pe-
culiar interatomic distance distribution: a) two bonds
within the frequently reported range (3.4 and 3.5 ˚A, er-
ror bar 0.2 ˚A) and; b) a extremely long bond attaining
4.8 ˚A. Bonds in the 4.5-5 ˚A interval have already been re-
ported [13], but although they do occur, they have been

ing atom in gold LACs. A total of 41 diﬀerent distances are

gated along diﬀerent crystallographic directions [14].

observed only in very rare cases in our HRTEM experi-
ments. It is interesting to observe the LAC interatomic
distance histogram distribution (Fig. 3). Although the
number of counts is rather low, we can easily observe that
the bond-length values cover the whole range from 2.88
˚A (nearest neighbor distance) to 3.7 ˚A. The histogram
shows a peak position at about 3.6 ˚A, which seems to
be a threshold value.
In addition, an isolated point is
measured at 4.8 ˚A, corresponding to the image in Fig.
2(c).

The image in Fig. 2c, allows the clear identiﬁcation
of two quite diﬀerent interatomic distances which coexist
on the same LAC. Thus, they can not be related to the
same phenomena, as for example tensile stress on clean
gold atoms. This example suggests that the presence of
contamination is one of the main issues to be analyzed,
in particular considering that light atoms such as carbon
would not be detectable within the signal-to-noise ratio
of typical HRTEM images [15]. We have then proceeded
to model the LAC structures considering the presence of
carbon contamination. Since it has also been speculated
that other atoms could be present [15], we have analyzed
N, O, S, and Si atoms as well. However, carbon is the
atom that provides results more consistent when com-
pared to the experimental data. Thus we present here
only the C results.

Initial structures were generated considering that the
gold atoms are at arbitrary positions forming linear
chains at distances of ∼4.0 ˚A. The carbon atoms were
positioned at distances of ∼1.5 ˚A above the middle chain
positions. Geometrical optimizations were then carried
out. No constraints or symmetries were imposed. We
have adopted the standard ”naked” cluster approach,
where no hydrogen or dummy termination atoms are used

[30, 31]. Recent ab-initio DFT calculations for suspended
gold chains [6] showed that the geometries for ”naked”
ﬁnite and inﬁnite (cyclic boundary conditions) structures
are essentially the same. This is an indication that the
”naked” approach is appropriated for LACs.

In Fig. 4, we present the results for some selected
structures obtained with DMOL; TITAN calculations
produced similar results. The displayed examples are
representative of possible structures considering the in-
clusion of carbon atoms at diﬀerent positions or conﬁg-
urations. We have considered C incorporation both in
its atomic and dimeric forms. In the former case, C-Au
and the Au-Au distances are of 1.8 and 3.6 ˚A, respec-
tively, and the structures are almost linear [Fig. 4(b)].
It is interesting to notice that the presence of a C atom
between gold atoms does not aﬀect their next Au-Au dis-
tances [Fig. 4(c)] which remains at the same value of the
Au2 [Fig. 4(a)]. The same behavior is observed for the
C2 incorporation, with the exception that the Au-Au dis-
tances are now ∼5.0 ˚A [Figs. 4(d) and 4(e)]. To verify
whether the presence of a large number of terminal gold
atoms would aﬀect these bond-lengths, we have also con-
sidered the case of adding two pyramidal (4 atoms each)
gold structures [Fig. 4(f)] at the chain termination. As
we can see, the distance pattern is almost the same of
Fig. 4(e).

In Figs. 4(g) and 4(h), we show the obtained theo-
retical structures in two situations, totally free to relax
and with the length geometrical constraint to match the
total LAC length as observed in the experimental chain
reported in Fig. 3 of Ref.
[5]. For Fig. 4(g) the values
are almost the same for similar structures considered in
Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). For the constrained structure [Fig.
4(h)], we observe that the distances are slightly aﬀected
(0.1 ˚A reduction) and can be attributed to the observed
bending. Considering the experimental error bar (0.2 ˚A),
the agreement between the experimental and theoretical
data is excellent, providing strong support to the pres-
ence of C atoms as proposed.
In Fig. 4(i) we show a
predicted structure for the case of an unstrained linear
chain of four gold atoms including dimeric and atomic
C incorporation. This system is to be compared with
the LAC of Fig. 2(c). Again, considering the error bar
there is an excellent match between the experimental and
theoretical data.

The theoretical calculations presented above have
mainly addressed the eﬀect of carbon incorporation into
the suspended atom chains. We would like to stress that
the existence of distances in the range of 3.0-3.6 ˚A do not
necessarily demand the existence of C impurities. This
can be deduced from the bond-length histogram in Fig. 3
which shows (within available low statistics) a continuous
range from the expected gold distance in the bulk form to
3.7 ˚A, as it should be expected for tensile stress elonga-
tion applied on clean bonds. However the histogram peak
at about 3.5 ˚A could result as a direct eﬀect of the C pres-

other chains, except (f), are bidimensional molecules, con-
tained in the ﬁgure plane. The system in (f) is a gold-carbon
chain, with suspended tips in the extremes, composed by four
gold atoms in a near (100)-Au geometry. Light (dark grey)

tances are in ˚A.

ence. An alternative explanation for the more frequent
observation of 3.5 ˚A interatomic distance can be that this
value is the threshold for elongation [32] and, further in-
crease would require larger tensile stress. At this point,
the apexes start to absorb the elastic energy because they
have larger degrees of freedom, as predicted in molecular
dynamic simulations [33, 34]. Thus, the more frequent
occurrence of the 3.6 ˚A bonds is due to the fact that this
length has a longer life time and then allow better imag-
ing conditions during the experiments. The experimental
data do not allows us to rule out the two situations (clean
or contaminated). However, the histogram proﬁle seems
to be more compatible with the coexistence of the two
regimes.

As for the longest Au-Au distances of ∼4.0-5.0 ˚A our
results strongly indicate that they should not exist (as
evidenced by many theoretical works) [6, 19, 21, 22]. To
explain these distances we must invoke the presence of
impurity contamination, more speciﬁcally C2. There are
many possible sources of contamination in transmission
electron microscopy work, such as vacuum oil from ro-
tatory and diﬀusion pumps, grease and rubber O-rings,
etc.. Concerning the physical origin, radiation damage

of adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules causes a carbon rich,
polymerized ﬁlm to form and grow on the electron irra-
[35]). In
diated areas (for details, see for instance Ref.
our experiments the initial carbon layer is cleaned by the
intense irradiation (see Refs. [5, 14, 23], however during
the nanowire rupture the vacuum chamber contains hy-
drocarbon molecules from the residual gas pressure (10-7
torr in our HRTEM). Although these molecules are in
low density, they slowly and continuously deposit carbon
atoms on the nanowires surface. When these C atoms are
generated close to the junction region (where the e-beam
is focused) they may be incorporated into the suspended
atom chains. The remarkable agreement between experi-
mental and our theoretical data, associated with the fact
that the presence of C atoms during the experiment is
highly probable and should not be detectable, support
the structures we are proposing.

In summary, we have experimentally observed the for-
mation of stable linear gold atom chains, and get direct
real-space information on atomic positions and bond-
lengths. To explain the origin of large gold-gold inter-
distances in those linear chains, we have carried out ab
initio density functional theory geometrical optimization
calculations for gold clusters assuming the presence of C
atoms as impurity contamination. Our results show that
the apparent puzzle of the existence of long interatomic
Au-Au distances (4.0-5.0 ˚A) can be easily explained by
the presence of C2 impurities. However, the bond-lengths
above 3.0 ˚A might be due to a mixture of clean stressed
bonds and those contaminated by incorporating a single
carbon atom. In principle these same arguments are ap-
plicable to other metallic monoatomic nanowires (formed
under similar experimental conditions) such as Pt [36]
and Ag [37], whose structures should also present large
intermetallic distances.

Abstract

The starting point is the problem of ﬁnding the interaction energy
of two coinciding homogeneous cubic charge distributions. The brute
force method of subdividing the cube into N 3 sub-cubes and doing the
sums results in slow convergence because of the Coulomb singularity.
Using symmetry and algebra the Coulomb singularities can be elim-
inated. This leads to an accurate numerical algorithm as well as an
interesting exact result relating the desired interaction energy to three
other interaction energies, namely those of cubes touching each other
at a face, at an edge, and at a corner, respectively. As an application
a simple model illustrating Wigner crystallization is presented.

1 Introduction

There are still many interesting problems involving the electrostatics of cubic
geometries. These have to do with cubic ionic crystals [1, 2], with the force
and potential from cubic charge and mass distributions [3, 4, 5, 6], and with
the electric capacitance of the cube [7, 8]. Here we will discuss the evaluation
of the electrostatic interaction energy of two coinciding homogeneous cubic
charge distributions. For unit charge distributions in unit cubes this energy
is given by,

where, ra = (xa, ya, za), and

This integral arises naturally in the free electron gas theory of conduction
electrons in metals, see Raimes [9]. Its actual value is usually not needed
for most applications of that theory. In an extension of the theory by Ess´en
[10], however, it is needed. Another application of this type of integral will
be given below. The value of C can be calculated exactly. Put,

for the electrostatic potential energy from a homogeneous cubic charge dis-
tribution. This potential has been discussed by Waldvogel [3], by Hummer
[5], and by Seidov and Skvirsky [6]. Using it we can write (1) in the form,

and this makes it possible to ﬁnd the analytical expression,

using twenty digits. Another expression for C in terms of a one dimensional
integral has been derived by Ess´en and Nordmark [1].

If we displace one of the cubes in (2) one unit along the x-axis the integral

one unit along both the x and the y-axis we get the integral for cubes with
an edge in common, call it Ce. If we ﬁnally displace one of the cubes one
unit along all three directions of space we get the integral for cubes touching
at one corner, call it Cc. One of the results found below then says that,

C = Cf + Ce +

Cc.

This might be a new result.

Coulomb interaction energy integrals ﬁnd one of their main applications
in Hartree and Hartree-Fock self-consistent ﬁeld studies of many electron
systems, see for example Raimes [9]. As an application of the results of this
paper we use them for crude estimates of the energy of electrons moving in a
cubic background of smeared out positive charge. In particular we compare
the energies of delocalized electron states with those of localized states. When
the density is small the localized states are found to have lower energy. This
is the phenomenon of Wigner crystallization [11, 12].

2 The brute force approach

Consider two electrons of charge e in a cubic box with edges of length L.
Assume that both electrons have constant charge density,

ρ = e/L3,

(8)

in this box. The Coulomb, electrostatic, interaction energy of these charge
distributions is then:

Here Va, (a = 1, 2) denote the cubic boxes over which the integration vari-
ables, ra = (xa, ya, za), take their values. We now introduce units so that
e = L = 1. The integral can then be expressed in the form,

which shows explicitly that this is a six-dimensional integral.

Nowadays we are spoilt by systems for doing mathematics by computer.
It is therefore tempting to try these systems whenever some cumbersome

integral arises, and frequently they do deliver sensible answers. For the inte-
gral (10), however, those that I have tried fail. Brute force can’t handle the
Coulomb singularity. Let us see what happens if we start by dividing each
cube into N 3 sub-cubes:

(11)
where the indices, i, j, and k, run from 1 to N. Our integral can then be
written as the sum,

N

C =

over N 6 terms, integrals over pairs of sub-cubes,

C lmn

N,ijk =

.

ZV ijk

1N ZV lmn
2N
For suﬃciently large N most integrals are over pairs of spatially separated
sub-cubes and can be easily approximated. This leads to a brute force ap-
proach. Fairly large contributions should, however, come from pairs of cubes
that coincide or touch since they are strongly aﬀected by the singularity.
Such an approach is clearly clumsy.

3 Removing the interior singularity

The awkward singularity occurs only in the interior of those N 3 terms of this
sum for which the integration sub-cubes are equal. If we thus write,

C =

C ijk

N,ijk +

C lmn

N,ijk,

(14)

N

Xijk=1

N

N

′

Xijk=1

Xlmn=1

where the terms with all three indices the same (i = l, j = m, k = n) are
excluded in the double sum, we see that the interior singularities occur in
the ﬁrst sum over coinciding sub-cubes. But these integrals are all identical
and equal to,

CN = C 111

N,111 =

ZV 111

1N ZV 111

From formula (14) one thus gets,

Apart from being over a smaller cube, the integral CN is essentially like the
original integral. In fact one easily ﬁnds the scaling property,

Using this equation (16) becomes,

C = N 5CN .

Solving for C we thus ﬁnally have,

and deﬁne the two quantities,

and, using this,

Clearly δN is the sum of the terms in (26) that approximate integrals that do
not contain singularities (in the interior or on the boundary). We thus have
that δ2 = 0 since for N = 2 all the sub-cubes are in contact. Therefore C 1
N
is an estimate of the integral C by a sum in which the integrals containing
surface singularities have been replaced by their (unknown) exact values,
while the remaining ones are estimated by their inverse distance, Eq. (25).

In Table 2 some results of this approach are shown. After ﬁnding four

solutions to the linear set of equations. For C this is clearly seen to give
excellent values. The three other integrals converge much more slowly but

6 Electrons in a homogeneous cube

Here we will use crude estimates of the Hartree energy [9] of electrons that
move in a cube of homogeneous positive charge density. Using this crude
theory we will investigate whether the electrons tend to delocalize in the
cube or if a state with localized electrons has lower energy.

We assume that the electrons either are delocalized in the cube and have
constant charge density in the cube or that they localize in one octant of
the cube and have constant charge density there. This means that we can
treat either 8 electrons or 8 electron pairs. With these assumptions the
electrostatic interaction energy can be found from the results above. The
kinetic energy is estimated essentially by means of the uncertainty principle
and the Pauli exclusion principle.

We start with 8 electrons in delocalized states. They are assumed to move
in a cube of side L and positive charge 8e. The energy is then the sum of
the kinetic energy,

In the kinetic energy the two ﬁrst electrons are assumed delocalized over the
cube without nodes in the wave function. The remaining six must then go
into the three degenerate states with one node. The ﬁrst term in the elec-
trostatic energy is the self energy of the positive background. Then follows
the attraction between the background and the eight delocalized electrons.
7/2 electron-electron pair repulsion terms.
The ﬁnal term is the sum of the 8
Simplifying this gives the total energy

The energy of this closed shell delocalized state should now be compared
to the energy of the ferromagnetic localized state with the electrons in one
corner each. We ﬁnd,

T8l =

for the kinetic energy since all 8 electrons now sit in cubes (octants) of side
L/2. They are however alone in their corners (octants) so the Pauli principle
is automatically obeyed. The electrostatic energy becomes

Finally we give the corresponding results for 16 electrons sharing orbitals
pairwise.
In the electrostatic energy one can then essentially change the
particle charge e to 2e and add the contributions from the repulsion within
the pairs. This gives the two curves,

for the delocalized and localized energies respectively. These curves are plot-
ted in Fig. 3.

One notes that the localized states always have lower electrostatic energy
simply because in these states the electrons are better at avoiding each other.
For small L-values the delocalized states always have lower energy because of
the uncertainty principle. The curves in these plots resemble those of Wigner
[11, 12] who predicted that localization gives lower energy in metals at low
densities. This phenomenon is called Wigner crystallization.

binatoric tricks used to eliminate the Coulomb singularities in the integrals
seem partly new, as well as the result of Eq. (7). It is possible that these
ideas can be generalized to more general integration problems involving the
Coulomb singularity. It is a further bonus that these insights into the elec-
trostatics of cubes and their sub-cubes can be used to make simple estimates
for the Hartree energy of electrons distributed in cubes in diﬀerent ways.
Such simple model systems are of value for the qualitative understanding of
more complex systems.

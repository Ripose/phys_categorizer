Abstract

In this work, we have investigated the interaction of a high-power Ar+ laser
beam, in a continuous multi-line regime, with Ag+-doped glass samples. The sam-
ples were subjected to the irradiation after the ion-exchange step. As a result of
the irradiation, a peak appears in the absorption spectrum; its evolution depends
on both the exposure time and the laser beam power. Interaction of the beam with
the clusters causes them break into smaller ones which has been conﬁrmed by op-
tical absorption spectroscopy. Depending on the increment steps of the laser-beam
power, diﬀerent results are obtained. It is found that, in addition to the fragmen-
tations of the nano-clusters, clusters of micro-meter size (d ∼ 3µm) are formed in
the sample, if the laser power is increased in a fast regime. The fragmentation pro-
cesses have been explained in the framework of the density-functional theory with
stabilized jellium model.

1 Introduction

Nonlinear optical materials, such as glasses doped with metallic clusters, are promissing
ones for optical switching technology [1]. These materials, because of their high trans-
parency; ease of fabrication; durability and thermomechanical stability, are essential com-
ponent parts of functional devices for optical communications, sensing and computing[2, 3,
4]. Metal nano-cluster composites are particularly interesting because, depending on the
choice of the metal and the dielectric host, they exhibit diﬀerent pico-second relaxation
times, range of chemical reactivities, and photo-sensitivities[5]

Several methods have been reported on producing and manipulating of metal-cluster
doped-glasses: Low-mass ion irradiation[6, 7, 8, 9], annealinig in hydrogen atmosphere
after the ion-exchange (IE) process[10], and induced modiﬁcations of nano-clusters by
pulsed laser beam[5].

In this paper, we report the results of interaction of a CW high-power Ar+ laser beam
with Ag+-doped glass samples, in two regimes of “slow” (SR) and “fast” (FR). In the SR,
the power of the pump beam has been increased from 0.1 mW to 8 W in a period of ∼ 90
minutes ( 0.5 W increment per 5 minutes ). In the FR, the power is increased up to 8 W
in 1 minute. The irradiation of the samples has been performed after the IE step.

The outcome of the SR results show that a 410 nm peak is appeared in the absorption
spectrum and the peak in the UV region of the spectrum has been blue-shifted relative
to that of non-irradiated samples. The appearance of the 410 nm band peak implies the
generation of neutral Ag clusters[11], and the blue-shift of the peak in the UV region
implies the generation of smaller clusters[12]. Both these features can be explained on
the basis of possible fragmentation processes of the ionized nano-clusters. The evolution
of these peaks are found to depend on the exposure (H = I.t, where I is the intensity
and t is the exposure time).

In the FR, also the 410 nm peak is appeared but, in this case, the UV peak is blue-
shifted relative to that in the SR results. In addition, in the FR, we have observed the
generation of micro-clusters. These experimental facts are discussed in detail in the next
section.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we explain the details of the
experiments and discuss the results. Section 3 is devoted to the density-functional calcu-
lations of the possible fragmentations of singly-ionized and doubly-ionized silver clusters,
and ﬁnally, we conclude our work in section 4.

2 Experiments and discussions

In our experiments, the samples are prepared using the well-known ion-exchange (IE)
method. In the IE process, some of the Ag+ ions in the molten salt and the Na+ ions
in the glass matrix are exchanged by diﬀusion through the interfaces at both sides[13].
The diﬀusion depth and the concentration of the Ag+ ions in the glass matrix depend on
the temperature of the molten salt, the IE duration, and the Ag+ concentration in the
molten salt. In this experiment, we insert a glass slide (20 × 30 × 1.8 mm)into the molten
NaNO3/AgNO3 mixed-salt (98%/2%) of temperature 320 ◦C for 4 hours (Fig. 1). The
glass components of our samples are speciﬁed in Table 1. The setup used to study the
interaction of Ar+ laser (pump beam) with the prepared samples is sketched in Fig. 2. In
this setup, the samples are subjected to the pump beam at the angle of incidence close to
the normal. We have performed the experiments in two regimes of irradiation: The SR
and the FR. Depending on which regime is chosen, diﬀerent outcomes result in.

One of the common features observed in both regimes, during the irradiation process,
is the formation of a micro-lens at the incidence point due to thermal eﬀects induced by
the pump beam. Formation of the micro-lens is implied by the appearance of a circular
interference pattern on the screen (Fig. 2 top left). This pattern is generated due to
interference of the reﬂected beams from the front and back sides of the sample, which
have obtained diﬀerent radii of curvatures (In the SR, the formation of this micro-lens is
initiated beyond a threshold of Pt ∼ 4 W). For a ﬁxed intensity of the pump beam, the
radii of these pattern rings increase with the exposure time up to a limiting value for which
a local thermal equilibrium has been achieved. The other common feature, observed in
both regimes, is the appearance of a 410 nm band peak and weakening of the peak at the
UV region of the absorption spectra (Fig.3).In this work, all spectra have been measured
using a Varian Cary-5 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The dimension-less quantity D
in the absorption spectra refers to the optical density

D = − log(

),

I
I0

(1)

where, I is the intensity of the probe beam and I0 is the intensity of the reference
beam in the spectrophotometer. The 410 nm peak is resulted from the excitation of the
surface plasmons of neutral silver clusters[11]. The neutral silver clusters can be created
through diﬀerent possible processes. In a fragmentation process, an ionized cluster may
decay to smaller parts, one of which could be a neutral cluster. These fragmentation
processes are discussed in detail in section 3. Another process could be the capture of the
electron, detached from another cluster.

However, there are remarkable diﬀerences in the spectra of the two regimes: In the

3

FR (curve 1 of Fig. 4), the 410 nm peak is narrower and higher than that of the SR
(curve 2 of Fig.4).
In addition, a blue-shift is modulated on the UV peak of the FR
spectra compared to that of the SR. The blue-shift in the spectra of the FR implies the
production of smaller clusters due to fragmentation[12] The diﬀerence in the shapes of
the 410 nm peaks in the two regimes originates from the diﬀerent size distributions of
the clusters in the irradiated samples. In general, a sharper peak implies a sharper size
distribution of clusters.

2.1 Results under the Slow Regime

Under the SR condition, we notice the creation of neutral Ag clusters, which is implied
by the appearance of a 410 nm band peak in the absorption spectra (Curve 2, Fig. 4).

To analyze the spectra from diﬀerent parts of the interaction region, we have divided
the circular-shape interaction region into smaller sub-regions, along the diameter, sepa-
rated by 0.2 mm and have measured their respective spectra. The results are shown in
Fig. 5. Labels 1, 2, . . ., 12 in Fig. 5 correspond to the sub-regions from the outer parts
towards the center of the interaction region, respectively. As is seen, with moving towards
the center, the height of the 410 nm peak increases and at the same time, the height of the
UV-region peak decreases. This decrease is accompanied by a blue-shift. These behaviors
are explained as follows. It is well-known that the intensity proﬁle across the laser beam
is Gaussian, i.e., the central part of the interaction region receives more photons than the
outer parts. Knowing this fact, and considering the curves 1, 2, . . ., 12 of Fig. 5 one can
argue that, the more photons received by the sample glass, the more fragmentations of
the clusters are induced. As a result of these fragmentations, the neutral Ag clusters are
produced. We will show in section 3 that for large ionized clusters the fragmentations in
which one of the products is neutral, are most favored (evaporation processes).

In Fig. 6, we have plotted the height of the 410 nm absorption peak as a function of
the radial distance in the interaction region. The heights are normalized to the maximum
height at the center. The center of the interaction region is located at point 2.4 mm (The
size of the interaction region is taken to be 4.8 mm). This plot re-conﬁrms the Gaussian
intensity distribution.

The relative blue-shifts of the peaks at the UV region of the absorption spectra in
diﬀerent sub-regions (Fig. 5), imply that the sizes of the clusters decrease[12] as we
move towards the central sub-region (the UV peak corresponds to the volume plasmon
excitations of Ag clusters [See Ref. 11, page 35]). At the same time, one sees that
the height of the UV peak decreases by moving towards the central sub-region. This
weakening is due to the decrease in the concentration of clusters as a result of interaction
with the pump beam. In fact, the pump beam causes the clusters fragment and scatter

4

in such a way that the conservation of momentum is satisﬁed.

Some of the mechanisms underlying the production of the neutral clusters, responsible

for the 410 nm peak, could be the following chain fragmentation:

Ag+

Ag+
N + photon → Ag+
N −p + photon → Ag+
Ag+
N −p−p′ + · · · → · · · .

N −p + Agp,
N −p−p′ + Agp′,

(2)

The fragmentation of large multiply ionized clusters (if any) are less favored because,
they require photons with higher energies. The theoretical calculations related to the
fragmentations of silver clusters has been discussed in section 3.

Another mechanism for production of the neutral clusters is recombination of the singly
ionized clusters with the electrons detached from other possible neighboring sources (glass
matrix):

Ag+

M + e− → AgM .
Heating the non-irradiated ion-exchanged samples, under the normal atmosphere condi-
tions for temperature beyond the ion-exchange temperature, leads to the appearance of
410 nm peak in the absorption spectra and a red-shift in the UV peak of the absorption
spectra (Fig. 7). This experimental observation justiﬁes the mechanism of Eq. (3).

(3)

2.2 Results under the fast regime

Under the FR condition, as under the SR, the creation of the 410 nm peak is observed.
Comparing the absorption spectra of the central parts of the interaction regions in the
two regimes, reveal that in the FR, this peak is narrower and higher; and in addition, the
UV peak is blue-shifted as well as decreased relative to that in the SR results (Curve 1,
Fig. 4). As mentioned before, a sharper peak corresponds to a sharper size distribution of
clusters, and the blue-shift of the UV peak is related to the production of smaller clusters.
To understand the detailed mechanisms responsible for these diﬀerences between the SR
and the FR, more experimental investigations are needed.

In addition to the above-mentioned diﬀerences, under the FR, we have observed the

generation of micrometer clusters. This experimental fact is discussed as follows.

After the irradiation under the FR, the appearance of large (∼ µm) neutral Ag clusters
has been observed at both sides of the sample. The distributions of the µm-clusters at
the two sides have signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The observations have been done by an optical
microscope using bright-ﬁeld photography method.

5

On the front side, the neutral µm-clusters are resided in a ring-shape area as islands.
Each of these islands is formed, at a nucleation center, by absorbing its surrounding nano-
clusters [Fig. 8(a)-(c)]. The nucleation centers mostly lie in relatively cold regions in the
glass matrix which corresponds to the lower-intensity parts of the incidence area (the
laser beam has a gaussian proﬁle of intensity). However, because of the inhomogenity of
the glass matrix, some parts in the inner region have also higher viscousities[1, 14] which
serve as nucleation centers. Due to the radial gradient in the laser-beam intensity, the
radiation pressure varies in the radial direction which, in turn, cause the relatively larger
clusters (d ≫ λ/20)in the central-part be pushed away from the center[15, 16, 17]. The
radial velocities of the clusters decrease with distance from the center. Thus, they can
aggregate mostly in the ring-shape region. On the back side of the sample, on the other
hand, the µm-clusters are seen to be distributed more or less uniformly in a disc-shape
area, centered at the beam center [Fig. 8(d), (e)]. This diﬀerence in the distributions
at the front and back sides can easily be explained by comparing the beam intensities at
these two sides. On measuring the transmittance of the beam for each line of the laser
beam, we conclude that during the irradiation, the intensity at the back side is much less
than the front side (Table 2), so that the mobility of the clusters is much less than that
of the front side. This cause the back-side clusters not to be pushed away from the center
but, just aggregate at those nucleation centers which correspond to the more viscous parts
of the glass matrix[18]. To our knowledge, the formation of the µm-sized silver clusters
in the glass matrix under the action of a CW laser beam has not been reported.

3 Theoretical study of the fragmentation processes

In the context of stabilized jellium model (SJM)[19] and self-consistent solution of the
Kohn-Sham (KS) equations[20] in the density functional theory[21] with local spin-density
approximation, we have calculated the total energies[22] of Ag clusters and thereby ob-

ply charged N-atom cluster into two clusters of respective sizes N1, N2 = N − N1, and
respective charges z1, z2 = Z − z1 is schematically shown. For the ﬁssion, we have used
the two-spheres approximation. Qf is the energy release, Bc is the fusion barrier which
is equal to the maximum energy of the Coulomb interaction of two positively-charged
conducting spheres, taking their polarizabilities into account. Bf is the ﬁssion barrier
height which is deﬁned as

Bf = −Qf + Bc.

The Coulomb interaction energy of two charged metal spheres has been numerically
calculated using the classical method of image charges[23]. The calculations show that the
maximum of the interaction energy is achieved for separations d0 ≥ R1 + R2. The most
favored channel for the evaporation is deﬁned as the channel for which the dissociation
energy is minimum. Similarly, the most favored channel for the ﬁssion has the minimum
of the barrier height.

as the diﬀerence between the pseudo-potential of a lattice of ions and the electrostatic
potential of the jellium positive background. All equations throughout this paper are

3.2 Results of Calculations

After the self-consistent calculations, we have calculated the total energies of AgZ
for diﬀerent cluster sizes (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Then, using Eqs. (7) and (8), we have calculated
the dissociation energies and the ﬁssion barriers.

N (Z=0,1,2)

In Fig. 10, we have plotted the dissociation energies of the most favored evaporation
channels of the singly ionized clusters. We have shown the most favored value of p by p∗.
The solid small square symbols show the most favored values p∗ on the right vertical axis
whereas, the corresponding dissociation energies, D1+(N, p∗), are shown on the left vertical
axis by large open squares. As is seen in the ﬁgure, there exist some maxima and minima.
The maxima of the DZ(N, p∗) correspond to the closed-shell Ag+
N clusters with N=3, 9,
19, 35, 59,. . .. These clusters have high stabilities compared to their neighboring sizes.
On the other hand, the minima correspond to the sizes which decay into two closed-shell
clusters (for example, Ag+
9 +Ag2). A negative value for the dissociation energy
implies that the cluster is unstable against the spontaneous decay.
In Fig. 11(a), we have shown the most favored products Ag0

p∗ and the dissociation
energies D2+(N, p∗) for the decay of Ag2+
N via evaporation channel. It is seen that the
most favored products are mainly monomers, dimers and octamers. On the other hand,
here, the mean dissociation energy is higher than that in the evaporation of singly ionized
clusters. That is, here, the number of clusters stable against the spontaneous evaporation
is larger than that in the singly ionized case. Evaporation is not the only decay mechanism
for multiply charged clusters, and they can also decay via ﬁssion processes in which both
fragments are charged.

11 →Ag+

N −p∗ + Ag+

Figure 11(b) shows the barrier heights Bf (N, p∗) for the most favored ﬁssion channels
Ag2+
N → Ag+
p∗. By deﬁnition, the most favored ﬁssion channel has a minimum
value for the barrier height. As is seen, for small clusters, the majority have negative
barrier heights. That is, most of them are unstable against spontaneous ﬁssion. However,
as N increases, the number of clusters with negative barrier heights decreases and beyond
a certain size range, all the barrier heights become positive.

A doubly charged cluster decays both via evaporation and ﬁssion. At small sizes
(N < 21), the ﬁssion process dominates because, the barrier heights for the ﬁssion are

9

lower than the dissociation energies for the evaporation. This situation is shown in Fig.
11(c). As is seen, the competition between the evaporation and ﬁssion starts at N=21.
This competition continues with some ﬂuctuations until the evaporation dominates com-
pletely. Since, the cluster sizes in the a ion-exchanged sample are[5] of order ∼5 nm,
which corresponds to N ≫ 21, the fragmentations mostly proceed via the evaporation
mechanism.

4 Conclusion

We have studied the interaction of a CW laser beam with the clusters embedded in glass
matrix. The study consists of two regimes of fast and slow.
In both regimes, neutral
clusters are generated (creation of a 410 nm band peak). Depending on the regime,
diﬀerent results are obtained. In the slow regime, the absorption peak in the UV region
of the spectrum is blue-shifted relative to that of non-irradiated samples, which implies
the generation of smaller clusters. On the other hand, under the fast regime, in addition
to the fragmentations, clusters of µm size are created. The experimental results show that
heat treatment of the ion-exchanged sample under the normal atmosphere conditions also
gives rise to the appearance of neutral clusters. The theoretical calculations show that
doubly ionized clusters of size N ≫ 21 decay mostly via the evaporation mechanism which
is one of the possible mechanism for the generation of neutral clusters.

Figure 9: Fission barrier in the two-spheres approximation. The parent N-atom Z-ply
charged cluster decays into clusters of sizes N1 and N − N1, with charges Z1 and Z2,
respectively.

Figure 10: Dissociation energies, in electron volts, of the most favored decay channels of
singly ionized clusters are shown with respect to the left vertical axis. The right vertical
axis shows the sizes of the fragments in the most favored channels.

Figure 11: a)- The same quantities as in Fig.10 for doubly ionized clusters, b)- the ﬁssion
barrier height in electron-volts for the most favored ﬁssion channel as a function of the
cluster size. The right vertical axis shows the most favored product sizes of the neutral
clusters, c)- comparison of the decay energies of via evaporation and ﬁssion mechanisms.
Competition starts at N = 21

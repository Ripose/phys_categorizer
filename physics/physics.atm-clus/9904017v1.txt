A VARIETY OF GIANT RESONANCES IN METAL CLUSTERS

V.O. NESTERENKO1,2, W. KLEINIG2,3 and F.F. de SOUZA CRUZ1
Multipole electric and magnetic giant resonances in metal clusters are reviewed
and compared with their counterparts in atomic nuclei. The main attention is paid
to E1 resonance (dipole plasmon).

1 Introduction

Metal cluster (MC) is a bound system consisting of atoms of some metal.
The amount of atoms can vary from a few to many thousands. Some MC,
mainly of alkali (Li, K, Na, ...) and noble (Ag, Au, ...) metals, demonstrate
a striking similarity to atomic nuclei (see reviews1−5). In these clusters the
valence electrons are weakly coupled to the ions and, like nucleons in nuclei, are
not strongly localized. The mean free path of valence electrons is of the same
order of magnitude as the size of the cluster. This favors the valence electrons
to form a mean ﬁeld of the same kind as in nuclei (with the similar shell
structure and magic numbers). In addition to the mean ﬁeld, MC demonstrate
other similarities with atomic nuclei: deformation in the case of open shells,
variety of giant resonances (GR), ﬁssion, etc.. As a result, many theoretical
ideas and methods of nuclear physics can, after a certain modiﬁcation, be
applied to MC 2,4,6.

This review is devoted to collective oscillations of valence electrons in MC.
Valence electrons can be considered as the counterparts of nucleons in nuclei,
and their oscillations as the counterparts of nuclear GR. Investigation of GR
it allows to understand deeper general
in MC is interesting in two aspects:
properties of collective modes in ﬁnite Fermi systems and, simultaneously, al-
lows to study striking peculiarities of MC. GR in clusters and atomic nuclei
are well overlapped. However, some speciﬁc properties of MC cause consider-
able diﬀerences in the behavior of GR in these two systems. For example: the
Coulomb interaction and the ”spill-out” eﬀect provide a speciﬁc dependence of
GR properties on the mass number; the negligible character of the spin-orbital
interaction leads to the decoupling of spin and orbital magnetic modes; clusters
can have much more particles (atoms) than nuclei, which favors very strong
orbital magnetic resonances; for most of the clusters the role of the ionic sub-
system is important; at diﬀerent temperatures MC can be in solid, liquid and
even ”boiling” phases, which greatly inﬂuences GR properties; characteristics
of GR vary considerably whether the clusters are charged or neutral, free or
embedded to a substrate, pure or with impurities atoms, etc..

Our consideration will be limited by certain physical conditions.

– i) The modern techniques allow to fabricate atomic clusters from atoms of
about any element of the periodic table. However, the conception of the mean
ﬁeld for valence electrons is realized only for a minority, – mainly for clusters
of alkali and noble metals and, in a less extent, for neighboring elements. So,
we should limit ourselves by this MC region.

– ii) In some alkali metals (Na and K) the ionic lattice can, to good accu-
racy, be replaced by a uniform distribution of the positive charge over cluster’s
volume. This is so-called jellium approximation which greatly simpliﬁes the
analysis and calculations. This approximation is enough for the description of
many properties of alkali MC and will widely be used in the review. However,
it often fails beyond Na and K and then a more explicit treatment of the ionic
structure is necessary 4,5.

– iii) The ionic subsystem is supposed to be ”frozen”. In the review only

collective oscillations of valence electrons will be considered.

– iv) The validity of jellium approximation is supported by temperature
ﬂuctuations of ions, which smooth ion positions. It fails in the low temperature
region (approximately at T < 100 K) where the explicit treatment of the ionic
structure is important. At too high temperatures (T > 1000 K) the quantum
shells of the mean ﬁeld are washed out, what establishes an upper limit for our
considerations. We will consider GR in a temperature interval between these
extreme cases.

2 Theoretical Grounds

Due to the similarity between MC and nuclei, many models of nuclear theory
have been applied to study MC2,4.
In due time, some of them have been
introduced to nuclear physics from solid body ﬁeld and then subsequently
modiﬁed to describe ﬁnite Fermi systems. Now they turn out to be useful for
clusters. In particular, a large variety of the RPA methods have been adopted ,
scaling from simple versions, like the sum rule approach6−9 and the local RPA
11,12, to sophisticated full RPA models, like time-dependent Hartree-Fock 13
and time-dependent local density approximation (TD-LDA)13−26 (for a more
complete list of citation see Refs.2,4,27). The simple models can describe the
gross structure of GR but not the fragmentation of the collective strength. The
full RPA models can describe the fragmentation but are very time consuming.
The last shortcoming becomes crucial for deformed and large spherical clusters
where the number of particles, and thus the size of the conﬁguration space, is
very large. In this connection, the intermediate class of the models, the RPA
with separable residual forces (SRPA), seems to be very promising7,27−35. The
separable ansatz allows one to turn the RPA matrix into a simple dispersion

2

relation. This drastically simpliﬁes the eigenvalue problem preserving, at the
same time, the main advantage of the full RPA to describe the fragmentation
of the collective strength. The SRPA version derived in Refs.27−33 provides
the accuracy of full RPA calculations 34, can be applied to systems of any
shape 29,30,32,33, and allows to treat GR in MC and atomic nuclei on the same
microscopic footing 28,30,33. The results obtained within this SRPA version will
be widely used in the review as illustrative examples.

For the description of collective oscillations, the SRPA, and most of the
other models, exploit, as a starting point, the Kohn-Sham energy functional

In the small-amplitude limit of a collective motion, the densities can be written

m0(r) are the static ground state densities (m0(r) = 0 in spherical and unpo-
larized clusters) and the values δn(r, t) and δm(r, t) are small time-dependent
density variations (transition densities). Then, in the linear approximation to
the density variations, the Hamiltonian (2) is a sum of the static and dynamical
parts. The static part

In what follows we will mainly consider clusters constituted from monova-
lent atoms, like alkali metals, for which the numbers of valence electrons and
atoms coincide, Ne = N .

3 Electric Dipole Giant Resonance (E1 GR)

Unlike nuclei, where diﬀerent kinds of GR are well investigated both exper-
imentally and theoretically, our knowledge in clusters is mainly limited by
the electric dipole resonance (dipole plasmon). Experimentally the E1 GR has
been observed in a variety of clusters: small and large, spherical and deformed,
neutral and charged, hot and cooled (see, for example, Refs.43−49). As a rule,
the photoabsorption cross section was measured by methods of the depletion
spectroscopy. For other GR (EL(L
= 1), M L) there are only theoretical
predictions6−9,28,30,32,50,51.

Physical interpretations of E1 GR in clusters and nuclei are very similar:
while in nuclei it is caused by translations of neutrons against and protons,
then in clusters it is a result of translations of the valence electron against ions
17. In spite of this similarity, the dipole resonance in clusters exhibits many
interesting peculiarities which will be discussed below.

3.1 Energy of E1 GR: Step by Step

The description of E1 energy for clusters is a rather complicated task. For
example, while in nuclei its energy depends on the mass number as A−1/3,
in clusters the E1-energy can both decrease (Ag clusters) and increase (alkali
MC) with the number of atoms. Let us consider this important characteristic
step by step.

Step one: Mie frequency and spill-out eﬀect. In the simplest ap-
proximation, MC can be considered as a classical metallic drop. Then, the
E1-energy is described by Mie expression 53: ωMie = ωp/√3 where ωp is the
plasma frequency. For Na clusters ωMie = 3.41eV . This value is much higher
than the experimental E1-energy which is 2.5-2.8 eV for spherical Na clusters
with N < 100.

The agreement with the experiment is considerably improved if we take
into account the quantum spill-out eﬀect. This eﬀect means that since the
valence electrons are quantum entities, they are not well localized and so,
unlike the classical ionic jellium, can be partly spilled out beyond the jellium
boundary. In principle, this eﬀect takes place in any two-component quantum
system including atomic nuclei and atoms (a ”neutron skin” in small nuclei is
a relevant example). With the spill-out, the E1 energy in MC is described as 8

ωE1 = ωMie(1

1
2

δNe
Ne

)

−

(6)

where δNe is the number of spilled out valence electrons. As a result, the
discrepancy with the experiment reduces to 0.2-0.3 eV. The spill-out eﬀect
allows to explain the increase of the E1-energy with N, observed in alkali
MC. The value δNe decreases with the size (for example, δNe = 1.5(19%)
and 9.5(7%)in N a8 and N a138, respectively 54) leading to the corresponding
increase in the E1-energy.

Step two: beyond jellium approximation, ionic structure, local
and nonlocal eﬀects. The remaining discrepancy can be removed in a large
extent by the explicit treatment of the ionic subsystem. First of all, we should
take into account that ions are not the points but have a size.
Inside this
size, ion core electrons (ICE) (do not confuse them with the valence electrons)
screen the pure Coulomb interaction of ions and valence electrons. To take into
account this screening, the atomic pseudopotentials (PP) are used (see, for in-
stance, 23,24,26,55). They allow to describe correctly the spectrum of valence
electrons in isolated atoms without the solution of the complicated many-body
atomic task. Being a sum of contributions of ICE with diﬀerent orbital mo-
menta, PP have local (s-electrons) and nonlocal (p and d electrons) parts 55.
To avoid dealing with nonlocal functions, the Pseudo-Hamiltonians (PH) were

introduced as the next simplifying step 56,57. PH, being derived from PP, lead
to less involved (but with the same accuracy) calculations since, unlike the
PP, they treat the nonlocality only through the diﬀerential operators. Fold-
ing atomic PH with jellium, one gets PH for atomic clusters19−21. PH have
the additional advantage to be easily incorporated to the common calculation
schemes.

As compared to the conventional Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, PH include the
additional local and two non-local (the orbital contribution and the eﬀective
mass) terms. As is seen from Figure 1, in K clusters (the same for Na) the
nonlocal contributions are negligible and the local term is enough to get good
description of the E1-energy34. This is not the case for Li clusters, where
only both, local and nonlocal, contributions provide the agreement with the
experiment 34. In some studies (see, e.g., Ref. 23) the ICE eﬀects are taken
into account together with some averaged treatment of the ionic arrays in a
cluster. The latter leads to an additional, but rather moderate, redshift of the
E1-energy.

Step three: direct dynamical ICE contribution. The ICE eﬀects
discussed above are realized through the change of the single-particle charac-
teristics with the subsequent renormalization of the residual interaction. Be-
sides this indirect way, the ICE can directly inﬂuence the dynamics and thus
lead to new peculiarities of the E1 GR. This can be well demonstrated for
Ag clusters where, like atomic nuclei and unlike alkali MC, the E1-energy de-
creases with a size 49. The physics behind is that in these clusters the energy
of ICE excitations is comparable to the E1-energy. The coupling of these two

results 34 are shown as bars for every RPA state to demonstrate the Landau damping and
as smoothed by a Lorentz function (of the width 0.25 eV) to simulate the typical thermal
broadening of the plasmon. The length of the bars is rescaled by the factor 1/2.55 to ﬁt the
scale of the smoothed strength. The photoabsorption experimental data are taken from Ref.
44. Bottom: The number of dipole particle-hole conﬁgurations, as a function of the energy,

modes additionally screens the interaction of valence electrons with ions (di-
rect dynamical ICE contribution) and ﬁnally causes the redshift (decrease) of
the E1-energy 59. This eﬀect is mainly of a volume character and so intensiﬁes
with a cluster size. As a result, the E1 energy in Ag clusters decreases with N.
This tendency overpowers the opposite one caused by the spill-out eﬀect.

In alkali clusters, where the ICE excitations have energies much higher
than the E1 GR, the direct dynamical ICE contribution can be neglected and
the evolution of the E1-energy with the cluster size is determined mainly by
the spill-out eﬀect.

4 Landau Damping and Width of E1 GR

The main physical mechanisms forming the plasmon width are the thermal
ﬂuctuations of a cluster shape and the Landau damping (RPA fragmentation
of the collective strength) 4,19,34,35,36,62,61. The relative contributions of these
two mechanisms change with a cluster size. As is seen from Figure 2, in
small clusters, like N a+
21, where the Landau damping is negligible, the thermal
ﬂuctuations determine about all the width. In clusters of moderate size, like

7

N a+
59, the Landau damping is stronger and greatly contributes to the width.
This is especially the case for deformed clusters. In large clusters, like N a+
441,
the Landau damping is weaker though its contribution to the width remains
to be considerable.

Figure 2 (bottom) shows that the Landau damping is closely related with
the shell structure 34. In N a+
21 the dipole plasmon lies in the wide gap between
the bunches of ∆
=3 particle-hole (ph) states and remains almost
=1 and ∆
unperturbed as a collective peak. With increasing the cluster size, the reso-
59, is already interferes with
nance approaches the bunch ∆
ph states of this bunch, which leads to the considerable Landau damping. For
larger clusters, the plasmon runs to the swamp of ph states. This leads to a
general trend of increasing the width which is, however, overlaid by sizeable
ﬂuctuations 34,35. But here a further mechanism comes into play: the coupling
between the resonance and ph states fades away due to increasing mismatch of
=1 ph conﬁgurations (which mainly generate the plasmon) and surround-
∆
ing ph states with much larger values of ∆
. This ﬁnally leads to a decrease
estimated analytically in the wall formula 36
of the plasmon width

The Landau damping in MC with N < 40 is rather sensitive to clus-

5 Temperature Eﬀects

In most of experiments with GR in MC, the typical cluster temperature is
estimated to be in the interval 300-900 K which corresponds to the thermal
0.09 eV. At these temperatures, ions behave as classical
energy kT = 0.03
particles and quantum properties of the cluster are mainly determined by va-
lence electrons. This can be easily proved 60 by using the uncertainty relation

for ions.

The energy of a quantum motion of valence electrons considerably exceeds the
thermal energy, which favors their quantum behavior. The opposite situation
takes place for ions which, therefore, should exhibit the classical behavior.
Such result takes place because the ionic mass is much larger than the electron
one.

The diﬀerence in ionic and electron masses leads to other interesting con-
sequence. Namely, almost all the thermal energy is contained in the ionic
subsystem. Valence electrons are embedded to the thermal ionic bath. So,
unlike atomic nuclei, MC represent the case of the canonical ensemble.

The bulk melting points for K, Na and Li are Tb = 336, 371 and 452 K,
respectively. This means that most of the measurements for GR in MC have
been done for clusters in a liquid-like phase.

As was mentioned above, in small clusters, thermal shape ﬂuctuations
It is interesting
provide the dominate contribution to the plasmon width.
that, while in nuclei these ﬂuctuations are mainly of a quadrupole form, in
MC they are mainly octupole 61. The reason is that spherical and neighboring
MC are soft to the octupole deformation.

Photoexcitation is a rapid process in the ionic time scale. So, every re-
sponse of a cluster represents its instantaneous shape and the experimental
cross section gives a properly weighted response of all allowed shapes 62.

The higher the temperature, the larger the plasmon width and the smaller
the plasmon energy. The temperature shift is estimated as about 1% of the
plasmon energy per 100 K 45,63. It can be explained by the eﬀectively increase
of the cluster size with temperature. The larger the size, the bigger the static
dipole polarizability which is expressed through the cluster radius as αE1 = R3.
The polarizability is connected with the plasmon energy through the inverse
< E1 >2 /ωE1. So, the higher the temperature, the
sum rule, αE1 = 2m−1 ≃
larger αE1 and, consequently, the smaller ωE1.

Recent experiments show that at suﬃciently low temperatures the gross-
structure of the E1 GR drastically changes 48. For example, the axially de-
formed cluster N a+
11 at 380 K demonstrates the typical two-peak spectrum
determined by the deformation splitting of E1 GR. At 35 K the same res-
onance exhibits much more complicated structure including at least 6 well-
distinguished peaks. This structure reﬂects the ionic arrangement which is
not washed out at so low temperature by variations of ions. In this case, the
jellium approximation is not valid and models based on this cannot be applied.

given by the same way as in Figure 2. The experimental data are taken from Ref. 70. The
deformation parameter β2 is extracted from the experiment 70 following the prescription8.

The E1 GR in small clusters at low temperature seems to be best described
by ab initio quantum-chemical calculations 64.

6 E1 GR in Deformed Clusters
Like nuclei, MC with open shells have quadrupole deformation45−49,64−68.
There are experimental indications of both prolate and oblate axial quadrupole
shapes, as well as of γ-deformation45−49. In the framework of diﬀerent meth-
ods (Strutinski’s shell correction method, ultimate jellium model, etc.) hex-
adecapole and octupole deformations as well as high isomerism have been
predicted64−68. Rather strong quadrupole, hexadecapole and octupole defor-

mations should take place at least up to MC with N
E1 GR in axially deformed MC exhibits the deformation splitting in two peaks
(see Figure 3). The right peak is about twice larger than the left one in prolate
clusters (see N a+
35).
Most of MC are deformed. But getting an experimental information on
a cluster shape, even in the simplest case of a quadrupole deformation, is
rather nontrivial problem. In nuclei rotational bands serve as source of such
information. In principle, deformed clusters can rotate. But, due to a large
value of the moment of inertia, rotational energies are very small and, being
of the same order of magnitude as the thermal energy, fail to be observed. In
this connection, the splitting of E1 GR in deformed clusters is now a single
direct manifestation of quadrupole deformation and the main source of the

7 Multipole GR, Asymptotic Trends, Restoring Forces

So far, the depletion spectroscopy methods (photoabsorption and photofrag-
mentation) were mainly exploited for observation of E1 GR in MC 3. The other
reactions ((e, e′), (γ, γ′) and etc.) are not yet suﬃciently developed, which im-
pedes the observation of other GR. The similar situation took place in nuclear
physics in early seventies. For this reason an investigation of EL GR with
= 1 is yet limited to theoretical predictions6−9,28,30,32,50,51. In Figure 4, E2
L
and E3 GR in spherical N a+
59, calculated within the SRPA, are presented as
typical examples.

It is instructive to consider the main trends of electrical multipole giant
resonance with the size (N) and multipolarity (L), and also the origin of the
GR restoring forces. Such analysis has been done within the sum rule approach
(SRA) in Ref.7. In the jellium approximation for valence electrons, n0(r) =

GR can be written as 7

The larger L, the higher the excitation energy of the GR. In general, due to
the ﬁrst term in Eq. 7, the energy of EL(L

For low L in small clusters this tendency is changed by the spill-out eﬀect.

The separate analysis for E0 GR gives the increase of the E0 energy with

It is seen from Eq. 7 that the value m3 has the meaning of a restoring
force 11. In Table 1 the contributions to m3 from diﬀerent terms of the Kohn-
Sham functional (1) are presented. It is seen that the restoring force for E1
GR is determined by the electron-ion interaction (ei) only. With increasing L,
the electron-electron contribution (ee) raises and starts to compensate the (ei)
Coulomb part. Simultaneously, the kinetic energy term grows. For high L, the
contribution of the total Coulomb interaction goes to zero and all the restoring
force is determined by the kinetic energy. The purely volume exchange corre-
lation term (xc) which within the LDA depends only on the electron density
does not contribute to m3.

The restoring force should not be confused with the residual interaction.
As is seen from Eq. 4, the residual interaction, unlike the restoring force, has
only the (ee)- and (xc)-terms for any L (where the (ee)-term dominates).

8 Anharmonicity and Multiphonon GR

How much harmonic are the GR in metal clusters? How strong is the mix-
ing of one and two phonon states? Investigations performed within diﬀerent
approaches71−73 give contradictory answers for one-phonon GR. While the
shell-model calculations found for E1 GR in N a20 some signals of anharmonic-
ity 72, other studies predict the harmonic character for M2(spin-dipole) and
EL GR 73,74. It should be noted that these studies have been done for rather

12

6
small clusters with N
20. In this size region the GR energy lies safely below
the lowest 2p-2h conﬁgurations, what does not favor the anharmonic eﬀects.
This picture can change in larger clusters where GR approach the region of
2p-2h conﬁgurations.

≤

The calculations 73 predict a noticeable anharmonicity for most of double
(two-phonon) GR placed at 8-15 eV. These GR exhibit a weak mixing with
one-phonon states but a considerable fragmentation between two-phonon con-
ﬁgurations. Most strong eﬀect is expected for some 0+ double GR, for example,
for (1−
21. With the appearance of new experimental techniques
allowing investigation of multiple GR these predictions are quite important.
The techniques use non-intense femtosecond lasers 75 or exploit collisions of a
cluster with highly charged ions 76. Quite recently the multiple GR constructed
from 3-4 dipole plasmons has been observed in N a+

9 Magnetic GR

Like in atoms, the spin-orbital interaction in metal clusters is negligible and
thus spin and orbital collective magnetic modes are well decoupled. The sep-
aration of these two modes in MC is easier than in nuclei.

9.1 Spin-Multipole GR

Magnetic multipole resonances (ML) of spin character caused by the external
j were studied within the SRA and RPA 9,10,51,52. For

spin-down electrons in z-direction. Unlike the electric resonances , the residual
interaction for ML GR is deﬁned only by the exchange and correlations ((xc)-
term) since only the (xc)-term depends on the magnetization density (see Eq.
5) . Therefore the study of ML resonances can provide a valuable information
about (xc)-eﬀects in clusters.

the operator QL, the (xc)-term now contributes to m3, unlike the case of EL
GR. However, the exchange contributions (Pauli principle) to v20
xc are
the same and then, only correlation eﬀects enter Eq. 9. The energies of spin
ML resonances decrease with N and go to zero for large sizes. The larger L,
the higher the GR energy. The behavior of ML GR much depends on the
diﬀuseness parameter a.

xc and v02

Table 2 demonstrates that the restoring force for spin-multipole GR diﬀers
from the electrical GR case. Namely, the contribution of correlations39 domi-
nates for L = 1 and 2 and remains to be considerable for larger L. The correla-
tion term includes long-range RPA correlations76−78, short-range correlations
80 and others. The correlations greatly inﬂuence both static and dynamical
characteristics of MC37,38,76−78 and their investigation is very important.

9.2 Orbital GR

Since the number of atoms in MC can be much more than the number of
nucleons in nuclei, much larger values of the single-particle orbital moment
can be achieved what can give origin to very strong orbital magnetic multipole
resonances, orbital ML GR. That is, clusters, as nuclei, can exhibit orbital
ML GR like,“scissors”, twist mode, etc., nevertheless with a much stronger
strength 8,81.

Investigations of the speciﬁc low-energy orbital M1 GR, which can ex-
ist only in deformed clusters demonstrated that it can serve as a good indi-
cator of the cluster quadrupole deformation 7,81−83.
Indeed, in some cases
the deformation splitting of E1 GR is washed out by other eﬀects and is not
enough distinctive to get a reliable information on cluster deformation. Then
the orbital M1 GR can be used for this aim. Macroscopically, this resonance
is treated as small-angle rigid rotations of the ellipsoid of valence electrons
against the ionic ellipsoid. Such collective mode was shown to be coupled with

M1 GR has the counterpart in deformed nuclei, well known as the ”scissors”
mode85. The latter describes the rotations of the neutron ellipsoid against the
proton one. The orbital M1 GR is represented by K π = 1+ states (K is the
angular-momentum projection) with a low excitation energy and strong M1
transitions to the ground state. For Na clusters these characteristics are esti-

where β2 is the deformation parameter, B(M 1) is the reduced transition prob-

proportional to the deformation parameter and so the orbital M1 GR survives
only in deformed clusters.

The results of the ﬁrst realistic RPA calculations for orbital M1 GR 83,84
are given in Table 3. It is seen that this resonance has low excitation energies.
The most remarkable result is that already in clusters with about 300 atoms,
the orbital M1 GR strength reaches very high values, 700-800 µ2
b. This GR is
described in detail in Ref.84 of the present Proceedings.

10 Other GR in Atomic Clusters

As compared to nuclei, atomic clusters provide many speciﬁc manifestations
of E1 GR. For example, clusters embedded in a dielectric matrix demonstrate
a strong screening eﬀect: the matrix screens the residual interaction between
valence electrons in a cluster, which results in the considerable decrease of E1-
energy 86. In mixed and coated clusters the impurity (or coated) atoms much
inﬂuence both the ground state and properties of E1 GR (see, e.g. Refs.86−88).
In the fullerene C60, two E1 GR are known as determined by weakly bonded
π electrons and strongly bonded σ electrons (see, e.g. Ref. 90).

3He and 4He clusters representing collections of fermions (3He atoms)
and bosons (4He atoms), respectively, should be mentioned. In 3He clusters
just 3He atoms (not valence electrons) form a mean ﬁeld with quantum shells
60,91,92. These clusters are characterized by strong surface eﬀects. Unlike nuclei

15

and MC, 3He clusters represent the case of one-component Fermi-system and,
so, have no E1 GR. At the same time, the study of other EL GR reveals new
possibilities, for instance, the comparison of the GR properties in Fermi (3He
clusters) 93,94 and Bose (4He clusters)95 systems.

Summary

Giant resonances in atomic clusters have been observed. Being much similar
to their counterparts in atomic nuclei, GR in MC demonstrate, at the same
time, numerous exciting peculiarities. The unique situation takes place now
in many-body physics where, in addition to atoms and atomic nuclei, a new
family of small Fermi systems (MC, fullerenes, He3 clusters, quantum dots)
appears. This greatly enlarges our possibilities in many-body studies. All
mentioned systems possess, in a diﬀerent extent, a mean ﬁeld with quantum
shells.

It should be noted that atomic clusters are attractive both for fundamen-
tal studies and practical applications 96. Last achievements (creation of new
materials, machinning superhard surfaces, creation of extremely large energy
densities in a matter, catalysis, microelectronics, microcomputering, etc.) show
that, due to atomic clusters, one may expect in a recent future a remarkable
progress in many high-tech ﬁelds.

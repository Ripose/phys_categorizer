We present our recent results on the scattering length of 4He–4He2 collisions. These
investigations are based on the hard-core version of the Faddeev differential equations. As
compared to our previous calculations of the same quantity, a much more reﬁned grid is
employed, providing an improvement of about 10%. Our results are compared with other
ab initio, and with model calculations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Weakly bound small 4He clusters attracted considerable attention in recent years, in particular

because of the booming interest in Bose-Einstein condensation of ultra-cold gases [1, 2].

Experimentally, helium dimers have been observed in 1993 by Luo at al. [3], and in 1994 by
Sch¨ollkopf and Toennies [4]. In the latter investigation the existence of helium trimers has also
4 ˚A for 4He2,
been demonstrated. Later on, Grisenti et al. [5] measured a bond length of 52
which indicates that this dimer is the largest known diatomic molecular ground state. Based on
this measurement they estimated a scattering length of 104+8
0.2 mK

[5]. Further investigations concerning helium trimers and tetramers have been reported in Refs.
[6, 7], but with no results on size and binding energies.

˚A and a dimer energy of 1.1+0.3

±

Many theoretical calculations of these systems were performed for various interatomic poten-
tials [8, 9, 10, 11]. Variational, hyperspherical and Faddeev-type techniques have been employed
in this context (see, e.g., [12]–[28] and references therein). For the potentials given in [9, 10] it
turned out that the Helium trimer has two bound states of total angular momentum zero: a ground
state of about 126 mK and an excited state of about 2.28 mK. The latter was shown to be of Eﬁmov
nature [13, 15, 21]. In particular, it was demonstrated in [21] how the Eﬁmov states emerge from
the virtual ones when decreasing the strength of the interaction. High accuracy has been achieved
in all these calculations.

While the number of papers devoted to the 4He3 bound-state problem is rather large, the number
of scattering results is still very limited. Phase shifts of 4He–4He2 elastic scattering at ultra-
low energies have been calculated for the ﬁrst time in [17, 18] below and above the three-body
threshold. An extension and numerical improvement of these calculations was published in [24].
To the best of our knowledge, the only alternative ab initio calculation of phase shifts below the
three-body threshold was performed in [28]. As shown in [29, 30], a zero-range model formulated
in ﬁeld theoretical terms is able to simulate the scattering situation.

Though being an ideal quantum mechanical problem, involving three neutral bosons without

2

complications due to spin, isospin or Coulomb forces, the exact treatment of the 4He triatomic
system is numerically quite demanding at the scattering threshold. Due to the low energy of the
Helium dimer, a very large domain in conﬁguration space, with a characteristic size of hundreds
of ˚Angstroems, has to be considered. As a consequence, the accuracy achieved in [19, 24] for the
scattering length appeared somewhat limited. To overcome this limitation, we have enlarged in the
present investigation the cut-off radius r max from 600 to 900 ˚A and employed much more reﬁned
grids.

II. FORMALISM

Besides the complications related to the large domain in conﬁguration space, the other source
of complications is the strong repulsion of the He–He interaction at short distances. This prob-
lem, however, was and is overcome in our previous and present investigations by employing the
rigorous hard-core version of the Faddeev differential equations developed in [31, 32].

Let us recall the main aspects of the corresponding formalism (for details see [19, 24]). In what
follows we restrict ourselves to a total angular momentum L = 0. In this case one has to solve the
two-dimensional integro-differential Faddeev equations

Surely we only deal with a ﬁnite number of equations (1)–(4), assuming l

lmax, where lmax
is a certain ﬁxed even number. As in [19, 24] we use a ﬁnite-difference approximation of the
boundary-value problem (1)–(5) in the polar coordinates r and q . The grids are chosen such that
the points of intersection of the arcs r = r i, i = 1, 2, . . ., Nr and the rays q = q
j, j = 1, 2, . . ., Nq
with the core boundary x = c constitute the knots. The value of the core radius is chosen to be
c = 1 ˚A by the argument given in [24]. We also follow the same method for choosing the grid radii
r i (and, thus, the grid hyperangles q
j) as described in [19, 24].

III. RESULTS

Our calculations are based on the semi-empirical HFD-B [8] and LM2M2 [9] potentials by
Aziz and co-workers, and the more recent, purely theoretically derived TTY [10] potential by
Tang, Toennies and Yiu. For the explicit form of these polarization potentials we refer to the
Appendix of Ref. [24]. As in our previous calculations we choose ¯h2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2, where
m stands for the mass of the 4He atom. The 4He dimer binding energies and 4He–4He scattering
lengths obtained with the HFD-B, LM2M2, and TTY potentials are shown in Table I. Note that the
inverse of the wave number κ(2) =
lies rather close to the corresponding scattering length.

Unlike the trimer binding energies, the 4He–4He2 scattering length is much more sensitive
to the grid parameters. To investigate this sensitivity, we take increasing values of the cut-off
hyperradius r max, and simultaneously increase the dimension of the grid N = Nq = Nr . Surely, in
such an analysis we can restrict ourselves to lmax = 0. The results obtained for the TTY potential
are given in Table II and Fig. 1. Inspection of this ﬁgure shows that, when increasing the dimension
N of the grid, convergence of the 4He–4He2 scattering length ℓsc is essentially achieved, however,
with different limiting values of ℓsc for different choices of r max. This concerns, in particular, the

transition from r max = 600 ˚A to r max = 700 ˚A, while the transition to 800 ˚A or even 900 ˚A has
practically no effect.

Bearing this in mind, we feel justiﬁed to choose r max = 700 ˚A when going over from lmax = 0
to lmax = 2 and 4. The corresponding results are presented in Table III. There we also show
our previous results [24] where, due to lack of computer facilities, we had to restrict ourselves to
r max = 460 ˚A and N = 605. We see that an improvement of about 10% is achieved in the present
calculations, as indicated already by the trends in Fig. 1.

Table III also contains the fairly recent results by Blume and Greene [23] and Roudnev [28].
The treatment of [23] is based on a combination of the Monte Carlo method and the hyperspherical
adiabatic approach. The one of Ref.
[28] employs the three-dimensional Faddeev differential
equations in the total angular momentum representation. Our results agree rather well with these
alternative calculations.

This gives already a good hint on the quality of our present investigations. A direct conﬁrmation
is obtained by extrapolating the curves in Fig. 1. According to this ﬁgure, convergence of ℓsc as
a function of N is essentially, but not fully, achieved. A certain improvement, thus, is still to be
expected when going to higher N. In order to estimate this effect we approximate the curves of

155.4, and 154.8 ˚A for r max = 600, 700, 800, and 900 ˚A, respectively. Comparing with Table II
shows that the differences between these asymptotic values and the ones for N = 3005 lie between
1 to 3 ˚A.

For lmax = 4, r max = 700 ˚A and the LM2M2 potential the scattering length has been calculated
for N = 1005, 1505, and 2005. Employing again the extrapolation formula (7) with a
, g being
chosen according to these values, we ﬁnd ℓsc(¥ ) = 117.0 ˚A. The difference between the scattering
length obtained for N = 2005 and the extrapolated value, hence, is 1.7 ˚A. A direct calculation for
higher N should lead to a modiﬁcation rather close to this result. Following this argumentation,
we conclude that the true value of ℓsc for the LM2M2 and TTY potentials lies between 115 and
116 ˚A.

For completeness we mention that besides the above ab initio calculations there are also model
calculations, the results of which are given in the last two columns of Table III. The calcula-
tions of [35] are based on employing a Yamaguchi potential that leads to an easily solvable one-
dimensional integral equation in momentum space. The approach of [30] (see also [29] and ref-
erences therein) represents intrinsically a zero-range model with a cut-off introduced to make the
resulting one-dimensional Skornyakov-Ter-Martirosian equation [36] well deﬁned. The cut-off
parameter in [29, 30] as well as the range parameter of the Yamaguchi potential in [35] are ad-
justed to the three-body binding energy obtained in the ab initio calculations. In other words, these

6

approaches are characterized by a remarkable simplicity, but rely essentially on results of the ab
initio three-body calculations.

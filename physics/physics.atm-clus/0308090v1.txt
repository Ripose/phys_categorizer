The 3He4He2 three-atomic system is studied on the basis of a hard-core version of the Faddeev dif-
ferential equations. The binding energy of the 3He4He2 trimer, scattering phase shifts, and the scattering
length of a 3He atom off a 4He dimer are calculated using the LM2M2 and TTY He-He interatomic
potentials.

The system of three He atoms is of great interest for various questions as, e.g., the formation
of liquid helium drops, superﬂuidity or Bose-Einstein condensation. The literature on experi-
mental and theoretical studies of the symmetric 4He three-atomic system is rather large (see,
e. g., [ 1]– [ 10] and references cited therein). In contrast, the asymmetric 3He4He2 system has
found comparatively little attention. To the best of our knowledge the numerical studies of the
3He4He2 trimers were performed only in Refs. [ 8]– [ 11]. Except Ref. [ 11], there are no
scattering calculations reported for this system.

In [ 5], [ 6] the symmetric 4He three-atomic system was studied on the basis of a mathe-
matically rigorous hard-core version of the Faddeev differential equations. Using this approach
allows one to overcome technical complications due to the strong repulsive part in the atomic
interaction. Along the same line we now study the asymmetric 3He4He2 system. We calculate
its bound states, the scattering phase shifts of a 3He atom off a 4He dimer at ultra-low energies,
and the corresponding scattering lengths.

In the present investigations we employ two realistic He-He atomic interactions, the LM2M2
potential by Aziz and Slaman [ 12] and the TTY potential by Tang, Toennies and Yiu [ 13].
As in [ 5], [ 6] we use the ﬁnite-difference approximation of the two-dimensional partial-wave
Faddeev equations. We consider the case of zero total angular momentum and take ¯h2/m4He =
12.12 K ˚A2 where m4He stands for the mass of a 4He atom. Notice that the 4He-dimer energy is
1.30348 mK for the LM2M2 potential and 1.30962 mK for the TTY potential [ 6].

Due to the smaller mass of the 3He atom (m3He/m4He=0.753517), the 3He – 4He system is
unbound. None the less, the 3He4He2 trimer exists, though with a binding energy one order
of magnitude smaller than the one of the 4He3 ground state (see, e.g. [ 5] and [ 6]). And,

in contrast to the symmetric case, there is no excited (Eﬁmov-type) state in the asymmetric
3He4He2 system.

Figure 1. S-wave 3He atom – 4He dimer scattering phase shifts d 0(E) in case of the TTY He–He
interatomic potential as a function of the c.m. energy. The lower curve corresponds to the case where
lmax = 0 while for the upper curve lmax = 2. The corresponding phase shift curves for the LM2M2
potential are practically the same.

The best dimensions of the grids employed in our investigation were Nr = 600 and Nq = 605
with a cut-off hyperradius r max = 200 ˚A (see [ 5] for explanation of the notation). The maximal
value of the angular momenta taken into account in the two-body subsystems was lmax = 4.
Our results for the 3He4He2 binding energy as well as the results available in the literature, are
presented in Table 1. One can see that at this point the different approaches agree fairly well.
A small discrepancy in the results is possibly due to limitations of the computer facilities. We
have found that most of the contribution to the 3He4He2 binding energy stems from the l = 0
and l = 1, 2 partial waves, about 53% and 42%, respectively. The overall contribution from the

3

l = 3 and l = 4 components is of the order of 5 %, that is, approximately the same as in the
case of the symmetric 4He trimer [ 6]. A certain (but rather small) deepening of the 3He4He2
binding energy may be expected when choosing a larger grid.

Our phase shift results obtained for a grid with Nr = 502, Nq = 500, and r max = 460 ˚A are
plotted in Fig. 1. Note that exactly the same grid was employed in the 4He–4He2 phase-shift
calculations of [ 6]. Incident energies below and above the breakup threshold, i. e. both for the
elastic scattering (2+1 −→ 2+1) and breakup (2+1 −→ 1+1+1) processes, were considered.
Table 2 contains our results for the 3He–4He2 scattering length.

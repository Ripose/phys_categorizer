We have investigated the potential energy surface for neutral and charged alanine

and glycine chains consisting of up to 6 amino acids. For these molecules we have cal-

culated potential energy surfaces as a function of the Ramachandran angles ϕ and ψ.

Our calculations are performed within ab initio theoretical framework based on the

density functional theory and also within semi-empirical model approaches. We have

demonstrated that the excessive positive charge of the system inﬂuences strongly its

geometrical and conformational properties. With increasing of the excessive charge

amino acid chains become unstable and decay into two or more fragments. We have

analysed how the secondary structure of polypeptide chains inﬂuences the formation

of the potential energy landscapes. We have calculated the energy barriers for tran-

sitions between diﬀerent molecular conformations and determined the ones being

energetically the most favourable.

INTRODUCTION

This work was presented on ”The eighth European Conference on Atomic and Molecular

Physics” (ECAMPVIII) (Rennes, France, July 6-10, 2004) and on the ”Electronic Structure

Simulations of Nanostructures” workshop (ESSN2004) (Jyv¨askyl¨a Finland, June 18-21,

2004).

Amino acids are building blocks for proteins. Recently, it became possible to study

experimentally fragments of proteins, i.e. chains of amino acids, in a gas phase with the use

of the MALDI mass spectroscopy [1, 2, 3]. Ab initio theoretical investigations of amino acid

chains began also only recently [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and are still in its infancy.

We have investigated the potential energy surface for neutral and charged alanine and

glycine chains consisting of up to 6 amino acids. For these molecules we have calculated

potential energy surfaces as a function of the Ramachandran angles ϕ and ψ often used for

the characterization of the polypeptide chains [11, 12]. Our calculations are performed within

ab initio theoretical framework based on the density functional theory and also within semi-

empirical model approaches. We have demonstrated that the excessive positive charge of the

system inﬂuences strongly its geometrical and conformational properties. With increasing

of the excessive charge amino acid chains become unstable and decay into two or more

fragments. We have analysed how the secondary structure of polypeptide chains inﬂuences

the formation of the potential energy landscapes. We have calculated the energy barriers

for transitions between diﬀerent molecular conformations and determined the ones being

energetically the most favourable.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

Our exploration of the potential energy surface of alanine and glycine chains is based on

the density-functional theory (DFT) accounting for all electrons in the system and on the

semiempirical AM1 method [13, 14, 15].

Within the DFT one has to solve the Kohn-Sham equations, which read as (see e.g.

[10, 16]):

ˆp2
2

(cid:18)

+ Uions + VH + Vxc

ψi = εiψi,

(cid:19)

(1)

where the ﬁrst term represents the kinetic energy of the i-th electron, and Uions describes its

attraction to the ions in the cluster, VH is the Hartree part of the interelectronic interaction:

(3)

(4)

and ρ(~r ′) is the electron density:

VH(~r) =

ρ(~r ′)
|~r − ~r ′|

Z

d~r ′ ,

ρ(~r) =

2
|ψi(~r)|

,

N

Xν=1

where Vxc is the local exchange-correlation potential, ψi are the electronic orbitals and N is

the number of electrons in the cluster.

correlation energy functional:

The exchange-correlation potential is deﬁned as the functional derivative of the exchange-

Vxc =

δExc[ρ]
δρ(~r)

,

The approximate functionals employed by DFT methods partition the exchange-

correlation energy into two parts, referred to as exchange and correlation parts. Both parts

are the functionals of the electron density, which can be of two distinct types: either lo-

cal functional depending on only the electron density ρ or gradient-corrected functionals

depending on both ρ and its gradient, ∇ρ.

In literature, there is a variety of exchange

correlation functionals. In our work we use the Becke’s three parameter gradient-corrected

exchange functional with the gradient-corrected correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr

(B3LYP) [17, 18, 19]. We utilize the standard 6-311++G(d,p) and 6-31G(2d,p) basis set to

expand the electronic orbitals ψi.

III. RESULTS OF CALCULATION

In ﬁgure 1 we show the dihedral angles ϕ and ψ that are used to characterize the potential

surface of the polypeptide chain.

In ﬁgure 2 we present the optimized geometries of the alanine and glycine polypeptide

chains that have been used for the exploration of the potential energy surface. All geometries

were optimized with the B3LYP density functional. We used the 6-31++G(d,p) and 6-

31G(2d,p) basis sets to expand the electronic orbitals in the molecule.

In ﬁgures 3-12 we present the potential energy surfaces for the polypeptide chains pre-

sented in ﬁgure 2.

In ﬁgure 13 we show the optimized structures of the alanine tripeptide. Diﬀerent geome-

tries correspond to the minima on the potential energy surface (see contour plot in ﬁgure

In ﬁgure 14 we show the optimized structures of the glycine tripeptide. Diﬀerent geome-

tries correspond to the minima on the potential energy surface (see contour plot in ﬁgure

4).

In ﬁgure 15 we show the optimized structures of the glycine hexapeptide in helix confor-

mation. Diﬀerent geometries correspond to the minima on the potential energy surface (see

contour plot in ﬁgure 5).

The geometries of singly charged alanine and glycine dipeptides are shown in ﬁgure 16.

The ionization of the system changes dramatically its potential energy surface and the

secondary structure as it is seen from the contour plots presented in ﬁgures 17 and 18.

In ﬁgure 19 we show the distribution of observed dihedral angles ϕ, ψ of non-Glycine

residues in protein structures selected from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [11, 12].

The circles show conformations corresponding to the forbidden regions.

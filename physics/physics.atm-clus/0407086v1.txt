Abstract. – The periods of the harmonic oscillations of the ion core of charged sodium clusters
around the equilibrium shapes are considered. It is found that these periods are of the order
of magnitude of the experimentally measured relaxation times of the plasmons, which suggests
the importance of the electron-ion coupling and stresses the role played by the electron-phonon
interaction in the dissipation of the plasmon energy. The relation of the process to ﬁssion is
brieﬂy discussed.

Introduction. – A considerable progress in cluster physics has been achieved for the past
years. The picture of the collective motion of the electron system is well understood, [1–3].
The collective electron modes have also been studied experimentally. On the other hand,
10−12
experiment shows a strong electron-ion correlation, with a characteristic time of
s [4]. There is no complete picture to explain such a strong correlation occurring in spite of
the huge diﬀerence in the masses which actually justiﬁes the use of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation. In principle, the energy of a plasmon can be directly transferred to the phonons
within a time which follows from the analytic solution of a simple model to be presented in
greater detail elsewhere,

where ωpl is the plasmon frequency, M is the mass of the ion and m is the electron mass.
For sodium clusters, this time is of the order of 10−13s, which may be even an order of
magnitude shorter than the experiments show. The relaxation time of the plasmon may be
identiﬁed with τpl, eq.(1). We summarize now the derivation of eq. (1). We consider plane
waves propagating along the z axis. We denote the displacements of the electronic and ionic
distributions, respectively, by u = u(z, t) and v = v(z, t). We denote the ﬂuctuations of

It follows that, for an appropriate value of the wave vector, the number of plasmons at time
t is

so that the plasmon energy will be completely transferred to the lattice in time τpl.

Our present purpose is to draw attention to the fact that the periods of the collective
vibrations of the ionic core remarkably coincide with the detected electron relaxation times.
This fact supports the assumption that the interaction of the electron system with the collec-
tive ionic modes plays a rather essential part in dissipation, as, e.g., in the electron-phonon
interaction in crystals. There is no need to assume that the phonon excitation will necessarily
result into ﬁssion, though the two aspects are generically related to one another, so that ﬁssion
is the ultimate form of a superposition of many of phonons in the limit of large amplitude
oscillation [5]. The importance of the collective modes for the electron relaxation was also
noted in ref. [6]. The inﬂuence of the ionic degrees of freedom on the electronic excitations
has been considered in [2, 3, 7].

In turn, cluster ﬁssion is a process of great interest. Experiment shows predominance of the
strongly asymmetric ﬁssion accompanied by emission of mono-, di- or, more rarely, trimers.
Symmetric ﬁssion remains among the most important topics of research. Study of symmetric
ﬁssion allows one to better understand the dynamics of the interplay between single-particle
and collective degrees of freedom [5].

In paper [8], we have considered the interplay between rotational and vibrational modes
of the collective motion in clusters, ﬁnally leading to ﬁssion. It was speciﬁcally found that
rotation favors ﬁssion through phase transitions occurring in the shape of the clusters rotating
with large angular momentum. This is similar to nuclear ﬁssion. On the other hand, only
neutral clusters were studied in [8]. It is well known, however, that the charge of the clusters
plays an important role in ﬁssion.

In the present paper we extend our considerations to charged clusters. Moreover, we
compare the obtained results with the experimental data, which became available after paper
[8] was submitted for publication. Sodium clusters with N = 18, 43, 92 and 470 atoms are
considered. In the light of recent experiments [4], we discuss the role played by the collective
motion of the core in the electron-ion correlations. Our discussion is based on the LDM (see [9]
and references cited in [5]) which is enough for the present purposes. We take into account
surface and Coulomb energies. The inclusion of a shell-correction term generally allows one

to obtain a detailed description of speciﬁc features of clusters, such as binding energy per
particle, ionization energy etc. [5]. Here, we leave out these aspects, focusing rather on
general tendencies than on detailed descriptions of particular properties of individual clusters.
On the other hand, the LDM is well-suited for the description of ﬁssion, due to its intuitive
appeal and transparency. Many properties of nuclear ﬁssion have been understood in the
framework of the LDM. Representative sodium clusters in a large range of the number N of
the constitutive atoms is dealt with, one of which, N = 92, is close to the clusters studied
experimentally in [4]. We also draw special attention to possible cases of soft clusters with
charge close to the critical value, just at the border of Coulomb stability, namely, clusters
with N = 43, q = 3 and N = 470, q = 10, q being the cluster charge.

Outline of the model. – We consider oscillations of an incompressible liquid drop such
that, at each instant, the shape is that of an axially-symmetric spheroid, with time-dependent
half-axis c in the direction z, and time-dependent half-axes a = b in the perpendicular direc-
tions x and y. We assume irrotational ﬂow. In view of volume conservation, the values of c
and b are related, at each instant, by cb2 = R3, R being the radius of the equilibrium spherical
shape. For sodium, R = 3.93N 1/3bohr, N being the number of the atoms in the cluster [12].
We choose c as the collective variable. The mass parameter can be found by solving the
Laplace equation for the velocity ﬁeld with appropriate boundary condition, analogously to
the case of small-amplitude multi-pole vibration [10]:

The velocity ﬁeld is

A solution of eq. (4) satisfying the proper boundary condition is

Results and discussion. – The results of the calculation are presented in Table I for
typical cluster with numbers of atoms N = 18, 43, 92 and 470, the charge q being such that
the clusters stay within the stability limit.

The periods can be compared with the experimental data [4]. In that paper, characteristic

times for the relaxation of the plasmon energy were obtained, which turned out to be 2.5
×
10−12 s. As one can see from Table I, the plasmon relaxation time is about the same as the
characteristic period of the collective vibration. Naturally, for the same period, the plasmon
makes thousands of oscillations. The plasmon collective energy is quite likely dissipated by
inducing the excitation of the cluster phonons. The electrons collective energy is directly

In the case of nuclear ﬁssion, the opposite relation to (18), namely, Γs <
¯hωph, takes place [15].
∼
In this case, the n-phonon structure is experimentally observable. This corresponds to the
Frenkel picture of ﬁssion [14], where the collective deformation arises from a large amplitude
oscillation, which, due to an-harmonic eﬀects, never comes back to the initial position, but
proceeds towards ﬁssion. In this picture, ﬁssion occurs on a competitive basis with dissipation
of the phonon collective energy inside the ion core. The observed fact that ﬁssion most
likely occurs through the very asymmetric mode of evaporation of monomers or dimers means
that strong dissipation of the core collective motion takes place, and that the relation (18)

That is, the many-phonon states strongly overlap. This means that classical approaches, such
as the present one, are appropriate for their description.

We note that in some cases, if the cluster is near the border of stability, in so far as kCoul
approaches ksurf , the vibration period increases by an order of magnitude, as for instance in
the cases of Na3+
470 in Table I. One can expect that, under these circumstances, the

search for near to symmetric ﬁssion for such clusters would be of the highest interest.

Abstract

Novel low-energy structures are found on the potential energy surfaces of the neu-

tral, cationic and anionic gold clusters AuZ

5≤n≤8(Z = 0, ±1) and on the neutral potential

energy surface of Au9. These structures provide new insights on the 2D ⇒ 3D tran-

sition in small neutral and charged gold clusters.

It is demonstrated that the size

threshold for the 2D - 3D coexistence is lower for cationic than neutral gold clusters:

the 2D - 3D coexistence develops for Au+

5 and Au+

7 on the cationic potential energy

surfaces while only for Au9 on the neutral. Two metastable long-lived dianions of gold

clusters are also reported.

I. Introduction

Finite gold clusters are very common building blocks for nanostructured materials,

electronic devices and novel nanocatalytic systems and as such, they have triggered

numerous experimental and theoretical studies (Refs.

[1, 2] and references therein).

Some of them have shown that neutral and charged gold clusters favor 2D structures

to unusually large sizes [3, 4] due very strong relativistic eﬀects [5]. The motivation of

the present work is to investigate in details the 2D - 3D coexistence for neutral clusters

of gold and to extend it on the positively and negatively charged ones. Before discussing

our own results and the new structures that we identify, we start this Introduction with

a brief review of previous works on small gold clusters.

In one of the ﬁrst ab initio calculations of small neutral and charged clusters of

gold Au4,5, based on the size-consistent, SCF-based modiﬁed coupled pair functional

(MCPF) method in conjunction with the Hay-Wadt 19-(5s25p65d106s) valence electron

relativistic eﬀective core potential (RECP), Bauschlicher et al. [6] predicted the most

stable Au5 cluster to be a planar W-shape of C2v symmetry (see Figure 1). This

geometry was later conﬁrmed by Bravo-P´erez et al. [7] within the second- and fourth-

order perturbation Møller-Plesset (MP2 and MP4) method with the same Hay-Wadt

RECP and by Gr¨onbeck and Andreoni [8] who used a variety of density functional

(DF) methods. The 3D Au5 clusters were reported to be higher in energy. Two low-

energy trigonal bipyramid structures were found 0.42 and 0.95 eV above the W-shape

in Ref.

[7] (0.79 eV in Ref.

[9] within the LDA PW91 method). The LSDA method

with the Perdew-Zunger parametrization of the Ceperley-Alder data for the electron

gas [8] also favors the trigonal pyramid as the most stable 3D structure of Au5, though

0.72 eV higher than the W-form. The square pyramid is found 0.87 eV above the

W-structure [8]. However, the BLYP density functional with the same RECP slightly

reverses this order: the square pyramid lies 1.00 eV above the W-form while the trigonal

2

pyramid is somewhat higher at 1.03 eV [8]. Using the BP86 DF method together with

the Stuttgart 19e-RECP, Bonaˇci´c-Kouteck´y et al.

[10] found that the C2v trigonal

bipyramid is 0.930 eV higher than the W-structure. For anionic ﬁve-gold clusters, the

square pyramid becomes more stable compared to the trigonal one (0.88 vs. 1.14 eV

for LSDA and 1.05 vs. 1.25 eV for BLYP) [8].

The global minimum of the six-gold cluster possesses a planar, D3h-symmetry tri-

angular structure [7]. The pentagonal pyramid is energetically higher by 0.44 eV [7].

Due to this smaller 2D - 3D energy diﬀerence compared to that predicted for ﬁve-gold

clusters, it was then suggested that “probably at n = 7 a 3D form could be the most

stable or at least in degeneracy with a planar stable isomer” (Ref. [7b], p. 663). How-

ever, as reported in Ref.

[10], the pentagonal pyramid lies 0.914 eV higher than the

triangular cluster. In contrast, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA),

the pentagonal bipyramid is found to be the lowest energy structure, 0.16 eV below

the planar hexagonal structure [9].

H¨akkinen and Landman [3, 4] theoretically predicted that the 2D ⇒ 3D transition

occurs for Aun and Au−

n when n ≥ 8 and n ≥ 7, respectively (see also Ref.

[11] for

a study of the pyramidal Au7 cluster with D5h symmetry and Ref.

[12] for recent

studies of the adsorption of methanol on gold clusters). It has recently been shown by

Bonaˇci´c-Kouteck´y et al.

[10] that 3D structures appear to be higher the 2D ones for

n = 7 − 10 by 0.528 eV (n = 7), 0.530 eV (n = 8; for opposite results for n = 7 and

8 see the recent work [9]), 0.224 eV (n = 9), and 0.285 eV (n = 10). Interestingly,

the diﬀerences in the binding energies per atom between the 2D ground-state and the

lowest-energy 3D structures calculated in this work [10] fall from 0.19 eV for n = 5

and 0.15 eV for n = 6 to 0.02 - 0.03 eV for n = 7 − 9. A simple structural rule

has been proposed in this study [10]: the ground-state structures of Au4≤n≤7 can be

derived by adding a single Au atom to the lowest-energy structure Aun−1 and forming

3

an additional triangular subunit. This rule has been suggested to be a manifestation

of the strong s − d hybridization and of the preference for the directional d-character

bonds over the isotropic s-ones. However, this structural motif disappears for Au8

where the square is capped by four atoms of gold on each side [10]. The 2D - 3D

boundary for the neutrals was recently further extended to at least n = 13 [3]. The

recent gas-phase mobility experiments by Furche et al.

[13] have demonstrated that

planar anionic gold clusters are more stable for sizes as large as n = 9 − 11. On the

other hand, similar experiments on the cationic gold clusters, supported by the GGA

DF computations with the S-VWN+Becke-Perdew (BP86) parametrization together

with the Stuttgart RECP, showed that Au+

n are 2D for n = 3 − 7 and 3D for n = 8 − 13

[14].

Understanding the 2D - 3D transition in small neutral and charged gold clusters

is the main theme of the present work. The paper is organized as follows. Section

II is devoted to a brief outline of the computational approach that is based on three

commonly used relativistic eﬀective core potentials. In Sections III - VI we provide

a systematic analysis of the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of AuZ

5≤n≤8(Z = 0, ±1)

and identify therein a variety of novel structures that bring new insights on the 2D ⇒

3D transition. In Section VII we demonstrate the 2D - 3D coexistence on the PES of

neutral Au9. To conclude, the emerging trends of the 2D-3D transition as a function of

the size, charge and odd or even number of electrons of the small gold clusters studied

here are discussed in Section VIII.

II. Computational Methodology

All computations of gold clusters reported in the present work were carried out with

the hybrid density functional B3LYP potential in conjunction with a variety of energy-

consistent 19-(5s25p65d106s) valence electron RECPs including the Los Alamos double-

4

zeta type RECP LANL2DZ (≡ A) [15], the RECP developed by Ermler, Christiansen

and co-workers (≡ B) with the primitive basis set (5s5p4d) [16], and the RECP of the

Stuttgart group (≡ C) with the basis set (8s7p6d)/[6s5p3d] [17] (see also Refs. [6, 7,

18] for the description of these RECPs). The reliability of the chosen RECPs has been

assessed in Refs.

[7, 10, 13, 14, 18-22] by comparing the computed results for small

gold clusters (dimer, trimer and their charged species) with the experimental data.

The GAUSSIAN 03 package of quantum chemical programs [23] was used throughout.

All geometrical optimizations were conducted with the keyword “tight”.

The B3LYP DF has recently been used for the gold clusters [20, 24-26] along with

the others DFs: BP86 [10, 14], BLYP [8], PW91 [19], BPW91 [27], BPW [18]. Com-

pared to the MP2 level, B3LYP was found [20] to give very similar geometries for

clusters containing gold atoms, i.e., the Au-Au distances are ≈ 4 % longer than the

MP2 ones, with the B3LYP ones being more accurate, so that the density functional

approach might be more realistic for the gold clusters than MP2 [20]. On the other

hand, Bonaˇci´c-Kouteck´y et al. [10] and Lee et al. [18] have recently pointed out that

the DF methods determine relatively small s−d energy gaps and underestimate the gap

EHL between the highly occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccu-

pied molecular orbital (LUMO). For example, the s − d orbital energy gap between the

d10s1 and d9s2 conﬁgurations of Au− is estimated in the present work as equal to 0.88

eV (B3LYP/A), 1.12 eV (B3LYP/B), 1.37 eV (B3LYP/C), 0.23 eV (BP86/A), 0.43

eV (BP86/B), and 0.62 eV (BP86/C). These values are smaller than the experimental

magnitude of 1.34 eV [28] except for the third estimate demonstrating a good per-

formance of the B3LYP/C computational level for this task. To further pursue such

comparisons for the geometrical, energetic, and MO patterns of larger gold clusters

and to strengthen the credibility of the present conclusions, the BP86/A and PW91/A

methods are also used for some key structures studied in this work.

It is the well-

5

known fact that DF methods favor planar structures for gold clusters (see Refs.

[10,

18] and references therein). Since the present work focuses on the 2D - 3D transitions

in the neutral and charged gold clusters studied by means of these methods, we have

to estimate the DFT/RECP error in energy within which given Au clusters are treated

as almost energetically equivalent.

A value of the DFT/RECP error in energy based on the BP86/C method was

proposed in Ref.

[10].

It is deﬁned as the energy diﬀerence between 2D and 3D

structures for Au9 clusters and equal to ≈ 0.2 eV (≈ 4 kcal·mol−1; on p. 3124 of

Ref.

[10] this error is equal to 0.224 eV or 5.16 kcal/mol). As reported above, such

a magnitude is in agreement with the error found in estimating of the s − d orbital

energy gap at the B3LYP/B and B3LYP/C compared to the experimental data. We

suggest to take this value as the error margin for the B3LYP/RECP methods used here

to study the 2D - 3D transitions in neutral and charged gold clusters. We futhermore

demonstrate in Section VII, devoted to the neutral Au9 clusters, that the two criteria,

viz., the energy diﬀerence between 2D and 3D structures as used in Ref. [10] and the

s−d orbital gaps lead indeed to the same value of 0.19 - 0.2 eV (≈ 4.33 - 4.55 kcal/mol,

see Table 2).

The harmonic vibrational frequencies and corresponding zero-point vibrational en-

ergies (ZPVE) were calculated at all employed B3LYP/X levels (X = A, B, and C) in

order to determine the topology of the stationary points. The electronic energies calcu-

lated by means of the B3LYP DF with the basis sets A, B, and C are hereby reported

in the following order: EnergyB3LY P/A (EnergyB3LY P/A + ZPVE) [EnergyB3LY P/B

(EnergyB3LY P/B + ZPVE); EnergyB3LY P/C (EnergyB3LY P/C + ZPVE)]. The BP86/A

values are given in curly brackets whereas the PW91/A ones appear in the double curly

brackets. Similar notations are used for the optimized geometrical parameters.

The vertical electron detachment energy, VDE, is calculated as the total energy

6

diﬀerence between the anionic and neutral clusters, both taken in the anionic optimized

geometry without the ZPVE. The adiabatic electron aﬃnity, EAa and ionization energy,

IEa, are calculated as the total energy diﬀerence between the anionic and cationic

clusters, respectively, and the parent neutral cluster in their optimized geometries.

III. AuZ
5

The PES of the neutral gold cluster Au5 includes four low-energy planar structures

that are shown in Figure 1. In full agreement with all the earlier studies [4, 6-10, 19,

29], at all the employed computational levels, the global minimum is the nonpolar,

trapezoidal W-shape cluster AuI

5 of C2v symmetry in the electronic state 2A1.

Its

geometry is compatible with the triangular motif rule. AuI

5 has one 4-coordinated

Au atom and two 3- and two 2-coordinated ones. The Au-Au distances in AuI

5 are

partitioned into four classes (see Table 1): the largest ones, 2.83 - 2.87, ˚A separate 4-

and 3-coordinated atoms; those between 3-coordinated atoms are 2.74 - 2.78 ˚A, and

those between 2- and 3-coordinated atoms 2.72 - 2.75 ˚A. The 2- and 4-coordinated

atoms are connected by the shortest bonds with the bond lengths of 2.68 - 2.70 ˚A. The

spin-up and spin-down gaps, EHL↑ and EHL↓, are equal to 1.58 (1.57) and 1.01 (1.02)

eV, respectively at the BP86/A (PW91/A) computational levels (cf. with EHL↑ = 1.51

eV in Ref.

[9] and 1.37 eV in Ref. [29]). The B3LYP DF method estimates them at

about 2.5 and 2.2 eV, respectively (Table 2).

The next structure, by increasing energy, is the X-shape nonpolar cluster AuII
5

in

the 2B2u state of D2h symmetry, lying 7.3 - 8.2 kcal·mol−1 above the ground W-shape

state (see Table 2). These energies fall within the earlier reported range: 7.84 - 14.53

kcal·mol−1 [8] and 9.75 kcal·mol−1 [10]. Compared to AuI

5, AuII

5 possesses a narrower

spin-up HOMO-LUMO gap (0.77 eV for the BP86/A; 1.4 - 1.5 eV for the B3LYP) and

7

a slightly wider one for the spin-down electrons (1.31 eV for the BP86/A; 2.7 - 3.0 eV

for the B3LYP; see Table 2).

Two higher-energy clusters, AuIII

5

and AuIV
5

(Figure 1), are reported in the present

work for the ﬁrst time. As follows from Table 2, they ﬁll the energetic gap between

the 2D clusters AuI

5 and AuII

5 on one hand and, on the other, the 3D pyramid which

is ca. 21.4 kcal·mol−1 above AuI

5 [10]. Both novel structures are less compact, less

coordinated, polar (1.2 D and ≈ 4.2 D, respectively) and characterized by rather large

polarizabilities (larger by a factor of 1.5 - 1.6 compared to that of AuI

5). Their HOMO-

LUMO gaps are given in Table 2. One of them, AuIII

5

, is rather important since it

gives rise to the most stable anion AuIII−

5

(Figure 1). AuIII−

5

is a novel structure too

(see Tables 1 and 2) and is 5.8 - 7.2 kcal·mol−1 lower in energy than the well-known

cluster AuI−
5

[4, 8, 13, 30], which is well beyond the estimated error of ca. 4 kcal·mol−1

of the DF/RECP methods.

The lower energy of AuIII−

5

is readily explained by its larger interatomic distances

r(Au2-Au5) = 6.807 [6.803; 6.889] ˚A and r(Au2-Au3) = r(Au3-Au5) = 5.300 [5.250;

5.296] ˚A, which reduces the mutual Coulomb repulsion between the partial excess

electron charges that reside mainly on these atoms (the Mulliken charges are equal to

-0.37 [-0.49; -0.55], -0.23 [-0.28; -0.23], and -0.37 [-0.49; -0.55] on Au2, Au3, and Au5,

respectively). On the other hand, in AuI−

5 , the excess electron spreads over Au2 (-0.24

[-0.19; -0.12]), Au3 (-0.31 [-0.40; -0.26]), Au4 (-0.31 [-0.40; -0.26]), and Au5 (-0.24 [-0.19;

-0.12]), where r(Au2-Au3), r(Au2-Au5), r(Au4-Au5) are only within 2.72 - 2.78 ˚A. In

AuIII−
5

, the distance r(Au1-Au4) = 2.7 - 2.9 ˚A is smaller by factor of two than the van

der Waals radius of Au implying that Au1 forms the Au-Au bond with Au4 and hence,

is distinct from the V-structure shown in Figure 4 of Ref.

[18] (see also note

AuIII−
5

[31]).

These two low-energy anions AuI−

5 and AuIII−

5

also diﬀer by their MO patterns and

8

therefore have diﬀerent catalytic reactivities. Within the B3LYP method, the AuI−
5

HOMO-1 - HOMO and HOMO-LUMO gaps are equal to 0.94 [1.01; 1.00] eV (see

note [32] and Table 2) and 1.21 [0.93; 1.09] eV, respectively. In AuIII−

5

the B3LYP

HOMO-1 - HOMO gap is substantially narrower, viz., 0.27 [0.23; 0.30] eV while the

HOMO-LUMO one is wider and equal to 2.88 [2.39; 2.41] eV. The EAas and VDEs of

these anionic clusters are the following: EAa(AuI−

5 ) = 3.18 [3.02; 3.07] eV; EAa(AuIII−

5

)

= 4.09 [3.96; 3.99] eV; VDE(AuI−

5 ) = 3.29 [3.09; 3.16] eV and VDE(AuIII−

5

) = 4.20

[4.09; 4.06] eV. The EAa and VDE of AuI−
5

are in agreement with the experimental

and earlier theoretical data: EAexpt

(Au5) = 2.992 ± 0.050 eV [33], 2.93 ± 0.10 eV

a

[34], 3.06(3) eV [30]; EAtheor

a

(Au5) = 3.33 eV [6], 3.33 eV (LSDA [8]), 3.04 eV (BLYP

[8]), 3.06 eV [27]; VDEexpt(Au−

5 ) = 2.98 ± 0.2 eV [33], 3.12 ± 0.05 eV [34], 3.09(3)

eV [30]; VDEtheor(Au−

5 ) = 3.35 eV (LSDA [8]), 3.08 eV (BLYP [8]), 3.2 eV (obtained

with the BP86 and the RECP C augmented by additional polarization and diﬀuse

functions optimized for the neutral Au3 cluster [13]), 3.06 eV [18], and 3.09 eV [30].

Obviously, such comparison is fairly satisfactory. Let us recall that the neutral parent

of AuI−
5

is the ground-state cluster AuI

5 whereas the neutral parent of AuIII−

5

is the

higher-energy isomer AuIII

. On the neutral PES, the transition state between AuI

5

5 and

AuIII
5

involves the breaking of two Au-Au bonds and its barrier is estimated to be as

large as 15 kcal·mol−1 (see Table 2). Since a similar transition barrier exists on the

anionic PES, AuI−
5

is metastable and that may be why it is this isomer that has been

observed experimentally. It would be interesting to detect experimentally the actual

ground-state anion AuIII−

5

reported here for the ﬁrst time (see note [35]).

We also demonstrate that two electrons can be simultaneously attached to AuIII

5

to form the dianion AuIII2−

5

shown in Figure 1. Its Au-Au bond lengths are collected

in Table 1. This dianion is stable relative to AuIII

5 by 65.6 kcal·mol−1 (65.8 kcal·mol−1

after ZPVE) although it still remains unstable with respect to the corresponding anion

9

AuIII−
5

by 28.8 kcal·mol−1 (28.6 kcal·mol−1 with ZPVE). It is responsible for the second

adiabatic electron aﬃnity (see note [32]). Such dianion may therefore exist only in

solvent or condensed phase (see Ref.

[36] for current review) rather than in the gas

phase implying that there is no contradiction with the statement that the smallest

stable dianion is Au2−

12 [37].

Ionization of all low-energy clusters AuI−IV

5

yields the same well-known planar X-

shape cation AuI+
5

of D2h symmetry [14] displayed in Figure 1.

Its bond lengths,

evaluated at the B3LYP/X (X = A, B, C) computational levels, are slightly larger, by

0.08 ˚A, compared to those obtained by Gilb et al. [14] using the DF BP86 in conjunction

with the RECP C augmented by additional polarization and diﬀuse functions optimized

for the neutral Au3 cluster (see Table 1). The enthalpy ∆Hf of formation of AuI+
5

from

the ground-state pentamer cluster AuI

5 is estimated being equal to 7.16 [7.13; 7.09] eV.

It is consistent with the B3LYP adiabatic ionization energy IEB3LY P

(Au5) = 7.16 [7.13;

a

7.09] eV. These estimates are close to the experimental data on IEexpt(Au5) = 8.00

(upper limit) [21, 22]; 7.61 ± 0.20 eV [40] and earlier theoretical data: IEtheor

(Au5) =

v

7.46 [6], 7.5 [18], 7.68 [21, 22], and IEtheor

(Au5) = 7.56 (7.72) [41] and 7.78 (7.83) eV

a

[9]. While the ionization pathways from AuI

5 and AuII

5 to AuI+

5 are direct although the

former is related to the Au2-Au5 bond breaking, the pathway AuIII

5 ⇒ AuI+

5 goes via

a transition state lying ≈ 15 kcal·mol−1 higher than the product and is similar to the

one that connects AuI

5 and AuIII

5

.

The cationic PES of the ﬁve-gold clusters exhibits the ﬁrst indication of the 2D - 3D

coexistence at the B3LYP/A and B3LYP/B computational levels (see also Refs. [12b,

41]). Together with the planar AuI+

5 , it contains the 3D rotamer AuI+′

5

(see Figure

1) characterized by dihedral angle 6 Au2Au3Au4Au5 = 82.4o and bond lengths r(Au1-

Au2) = 2.768 and 2.629 ˚A and r(Au2-Au3) = 2.645 and 2.629 ˚A for the B3LYP/A and

B3LYP/B methods, respectively. These bond lengths are very close to those in AuI+
5 .

10

AuI+′
5

is almost isoenergetic to AuI+

5 . It is 0.3 kcal·mol−1 higher at the B3LYP/A and

0.1 kcal·mol−1 at the B3LYP/B after ZPVE (cf. 2.08 kcal·mol−1 in Ref.

[41]). The

B3LYP/C level predicts this rotamer to be exactly energetically equivalent to AuI+
5 ,

though with a smaller dihedral angle, 6 Au2Au3Au4Au5 = 18.0o. The diﬀerence in

entropy at room temperature between the 2D and 3D cation of AuI

5 varies between

0.9 - 1.0 kcal/mol, depending on a level of computations, that together with the cor-

responding enthalpy diﬀerence of ≈ 0.01 eV gives a minor contribution to that of the

B3LYP Gibbs free energies of formation of AuI+

5 and AuI+′

5

.

IV. AuZ
6

The global-minimum energy cluster AuI

6 is well separated from the other isomers,

including the 3D ones in particular (see Figure 2 and Table 3). Structurally, AuI
6

retains the triangular motif and is obtained from AuI

5 by adding another triangle to

the Au2-Au5 bond of AuI

5 (Figure 1). It also retains the parent nonpolarity. Note that

the BP86/A and B3LYP/B predict almost equivalent geometries of AuI

6 (see Table 3

for details). The addition of one gold atom to AuI

5 elongates its Au2-Au5 bond of by ≈

0.13 - 0.16 ˚A (as the bond between 4-coordinated atoms) and shortens the bonds Au2-

Au3 and Au4-Au5 by 0.04 - 0.05 ˚A. Energetically, the binding energy of AuI

6 relative to

the asymptote AuI

5 + Au1 is equal to 60.4 (60.0 after ZPVE) [61.3 (60.9); 59.4 (59.0)]

kcal·mol−1 (cf. 50.3 kcal·mol−1 in Ref. [9] and 63.9 (54.2) kcal·mol−1 in Ref. [29]).

As expected, since it is a closed-shell cluster characterized by a larger binding energy

of the paired valence electrons compared to the single valence one, AuI

6 is more inert

than AuI

5. This is conﬁrmed by larger EHL of 2.23 eV (BP86/A) (B3LYP: 3.48 [3.35;

3.48] eV). The BP86/A magnitude of the EHL is very close to the experimental value

of ≈ 2.5 eV reported by Taylor et al.

[42, 33] (compare with the earlier theoretical

data: 2.05 eV [4, 6], 2.06 eV [9] and 1.74 eV [29]; see also the recent work [43]). The

11

IR strongest Au-Au stretching mode (doublet; 6 [5; 5] km·mol−1) is predicted at 167

[174; 167] cm−1.

Under ionization AuI

6 retains its planar triangular structural form [14]. Figure 2

displays the cation AuI+

6 whose geometry is compared to that of AuI

6 in Table 3. In-

specting Table 3, it is worth mentioning that the B3LYP/B bond lengths of AuI+
6

practically resemble those calculated in Ref. [14], using the DF BP86 and the RECP

C augmented by additional polarization and diﬀuse functions optimized for the neu-

tral Au3 cluster, within the margin of 0.02 - 0.06 ˚A. The adiabatic ionization energy

IEB3LY P
a

(AuI

6) = 8.46 [8.28; 8.33] eV is about 1 eV larger than IEB3LY P

(AuI

5) and sat-

a

isfactorily agrees with recent experimental data, IEexpt(Au6) = 8.80 eV (upper limit)

[35, 36], and IEtheor(Au6) = 7.60 [11], 8.55 [9], 8.17 [18], and 8.37 eV [21, 22].

We do not ﬁnd any new clusters on the low-energy section of the PES of Au6.

Notice that, as mentioned in Introduction, the pentagonal pyramid lies 0.44 eV higher

AuI

6 (MP2/Hay-Wadt RECP) [7]. The energy diﬀerence increases to 0.65 eV [18] while

using the MP2 method in conjunction with the 19-electron Stuttgart-type RECP C′

deﬁned in Ref. [18] and to 0.89 eV at the BPW/B computational level. However, new

ones are identiﬁed on the respective cationic and anionic PESs. There are two low-

energy structures on the anionic PES (see Figure 2 and Table 3). One of them is the

known planar hexagonal structure AuI−
6

[4, 18, 33, 42, 44] structurally resembling AuI
6.

Its VDE(AuI−

6 ) = 2.27 [2.18; 2.20] eV and EAa(AuI

6) = 2.16 [2.09; 2.09] eV (BP86/A:

2.43 eV satisfactorily agree with the experimental data: VDEexpt(Au−

6 ) = 2.29 eV [4],

2.0 eV [33], 2.13(2) eV [30] (VDEtheor(Au−

6 ) = 2.35 eV (obtained with the BP86 and

the RECP C augmented by additional polarization and diﬀuse functions optimized for

the neutral Au3 cluster [13]), 2.24 eV [18], 2.29 eV [30]) and EAexpt

(Au6) = 2.0510 ±

a

0.0020 [45]; 2.016 ± 0.050 [33]; 2.06(2) eV [30] (EAtheor

(Au6) = 2.22 eV [30]). The gap

a

EHL↑ of AuI−
6

signiﬁcantly decreases to 0.4 eV (BP86/A) (B3LYP gives 1.11 [1.15; 1.10]

12

eV) compared to the neutral parent whereas the EHL↓ holds approximately at the same

value of 2.09 eV (BP86/A) (B3LYP: 3.30 [3.27; 3.27] eV). The electronic energy and

enthalpy of the reaction AuI−

5 + Au ⇒ AuI−

6 are equal to 36.7 (36.4 after ZPVE) and

42.6 kcakcal·mol−1 (B3LYP/A). These values are within the experimentally measured

margin < 62.5 ± 9.2 kcal·mol−1 [46].

The other anion AuII−

6

(Figure 2 and Table 3) is directly related to the most stable

cluster AuIII−

5

on the anionic PES of Au5. Actually, adding a single Au atom to the

Au3 atom of AuIII−

5

in Figure 1 yields AuII−

6 with a gain of energy of 26.9 (26.7)

kcal·mol−1 (B3LYP/A). The anion AuII−

6

is however less stable, viz., by 2.5 (2.5) [5.8

(5.7); 4.4 (4.3)] kcal·mol−1 (BP86/A: 6.7 kcal·mol−1) than AuI−

6 . Its HOMO-LUMO

gaps amount to 1.91 eV (spin-up, BP86/A; B3LYP: 2.80 [2.82; 2.84] eV) and 0.86 eV

(spin-down, BP86/A; B3LYP: 1.84 [1.86; 1.74] eV). Notice ﬁnally that the reaction

pathway AuI

6 + e− ⇒ AuII−

6

is indirect and occurs through a barrier.

There are three low-energy clusters AuI+

6 , AuIII+

6

, and AuIV +

6

on the cationic PES

shown in Figure 2 (see also Table 3 for their geometrical parameters). In fact, they are

all cationic isomers of the neutral AuI

6 resulting from the barrierless (AuI+

6 ) or barrier-

type ionization pathways. The former two are the known planar clusters [14] although

the used B3LYP computational level slightly favors AuIII+

6

over AuI+
6

(by 0.9 (1.0) [0.3

(0.3); 1.4 (1.4) kcal·mol−1]; an opposite, as though negligible trend, of -0.03 kcal·mol−1,

is predicted in Ref. [14] for the DF BP86 with the RECP C augmented by additional

polarization and diﬀuse functions optimized for the neutral Au3 cluster). In terms of

the Gibbs free energy, the present order holds (with the corresponding diﬀerence of

about 1 kcal/mol) at room temperature. The third one, AuIV +

6

, is 3D and somewhat

less stable (by 5 - 7 kcal·mol−1) than AuI+

6 . Since this energy diﬀerence is close to the

estimated energy error of the DF methods, this indicates that the 2D - 3D demarcation

line appears at lower energies for the positively charged even-sized gold clusters than

13

for their neutral even-sized parents.

V. AuZ

Adding a single gold atom to AuI

6 and holding the planar triangular motif rule,

one obtains the known global-minimum energy structure AuI

7 in the electronic 2A′

state of Cs symmetry characterized by a stabilization energy equal to 24.6 (24.4) [26.8

(26.6); 24.6 (24.4] kcal·mol−1. This structure is shown in Figure 3 and its optimized

geometrical parameters are gathered in Table 4 including those computed within the

BP86/A method. AuI

7 is an open-shell cluster, slightly polar (0.4 [0.3; 0.3] D), having

the following spin-up and spin-down HOMO-LUMO gaps: 1.32 and 1.04 eV (BP86/A),

respectively (the B3LYP: 2.24 [2.19; 2.20] and 2.25 [2.20; 2.27] eV).

Our computations show that seven is the smallest number of gold atoms leading to

a cluster whose neutral PES contains a low-lying 3D structure. This is the novel 3D

AuII

7 cluster that is higher in energy than AuI

7 by about 5 - 6 kcal·mol−1, viz., 5.6 (5.5)

[6.5 (6.5); 5.7 (5.4)] kcal·mol−1 (the BP86/A gives 5.0 (5.0) kcal·mol−1) [47]. Figure 3

shows that the three dimensionality arises from capping one of edge triangles of AuI
6

with a gold atom (called ‘edge-capped pyramid’ by analogy with Ref.

[3]). The 3D

structure AuII

7 has twice the polarity (0.8 [0.9; 0.9] D) of AuI

7. Its gap EHL↑, equal to

0.92 eV (BP86/A) (B3LYP predicts a wider gap of 1.83 [1.74; 1.78] eV), is responsible

for its higher reactivity. The spin-down gap EHL↓ is larger, namely, 1.79 eV at the

BP86/A level (cf. the B3LYP estimates it as equal to 3.04 [3.11; 3.10] eV).

The 2D - 3D coexistence between the two structures, AuI

7 and AuII

7 , appears more

clearly on the cationic PES shown in Figure 3 (see also Table 4). Upon ionization,

the 2D cluster AuI

7 becomes the 3D cation AuII+
is structurally similar to its parent neutral. AuII+

7

7

via the 2D barrier AuI+ts

7

, which

is similar to the 3D neutral AuII
7

(Figure 3). The transition-state linker AuI+ts

7

lies 4.8 kcal·mol−1 higher (B3LYP/A).

14

This is one remarkable facet of the cation AuII+

7

. The other is that ionization of AuII
7

directly yields AuII+

7

. Such a 2D - 3D geometry change upon ionization is reported

in this work for the ﬁrst time. The AuI

7 ⇒ AuI+ts

7 ⇒ AuII+

7

pathway determines the

ionization energy IEB3LY P

a

(AuI

7) = 6.99 [6.94; 6.91] eV which is smaller than IEexpt

(Au7)

v

= 7.80 eV [35, 36] and rather close to the theoretical value IEtheor

(Au7) = 7.18 given

v

in Ref. [18].

Upon electron attachment, the low-energy 3D cluster AuII
7

found in this work ex-

hibits a 3D to 2D conversion that leads to the novel planar structure AuII−

.

7

It is

shown in Figure 3 (see also Table 4 for its geometry) and characterized by rather large

VDE(AuII−

7

) = 4.50 [4.34; 4.42] eV. The latter clearly indicates that a 3D structure for

the anion is less stable than the less strained 2D one. The HOMO-LUMO gap of AuII−

7

is equal to 1.72 eV (BP86/A) (the B3LYP: 2.85 [2.77; 2.79] eV). However, AuII−

does

7

not occupy the global minimum on the anionic PES of Au7, rather it lies above the

well-known ground-state tricapped square cluster AuI−
7

[3, 30] by 4.6 (4.5) [7.9 (7.7);

6.0 (5.9)] kcal·mol−1 (the BP86/A estimate is 10.5 (10.3) kcal·mol−1). Due to a large

entropy eﬀect, the diﬀerence in the B3LYP Gibbs free energies between AuII−

and

7

AuI−

7 , evaluated at T = 298 K, is rather small and equal to 1.9 [4.7; 2.2] kcal·mol−1,

reﬂecting the ﬂoppy nature of the bottom of the anionic PES.

The anionic PES exhibits two energetically almost degenerate 2D structures: AuI−
7

and AuIII−

7

shown in Figure 3 (see Table 4 and note [48]). The latter is a novel structure

obtained by adding a single gold atom to one of the edge atoms of AuI−

6 . Actually, it

lies 2.5 (2.5) [1.7 (1.7); 2.4 (2.4)] kcal·mol−1 (the BP86/A: 0.9 (0.9) kcal·mol−1) below

AuI−

7 . Its VDE(AuIII−

7

) = 3.87 [3.74; 3.74] eV and its HOMO-LUMO gap is equal to

1.35 (BP86/A) (whereas the B3LYP gives 2.17 [2.17; 2.12] eV).

The parent neutral cluster of AuIII−

7

is the honeycomb AuIII

7

in the state 2B2g of D2h

symmetry [10]. On the neutral PES, AuIII

7

lies however 9.0 (8.8) [7.7 (7.5); 9.0 (8.8)]

15

kcal·mol−1 above the ground state (the BP86/A value is 8.1 (7.9) kcal·mol−1; cf. with

7.0 kcal·mol−1 in Ref. [10]; see also note [49]). In contrast to AuI

7, AuIII

7

is nonpolar

and its spin-split HOMO-LUMO gaps are equal to 0.18 and 1.73 eV (BP86/A) (cf.

with the B3LYP predictions: 1.01 [0.95; 0.97] and 2.76 [2.76; 2.78] eV and the value of

0.87 eV reported in Ref. [29]).

Compared to AuII−

7

, AuI−
7

is more reactive due to a smaller EHL gap = 1.18 eV

(BP86/A) (the B3LYP: 1.95 [1.94; 1.89] eV) and is characterized by an EAa = 3.40

(3.40) [3.29 (3.29); 3.28 (3.28)] eV (3.62 eV for the BP86/A) and a VDE = 3.50 [3.39;

3.38] eV. Both these computed values are fairly close to EAexpt

(Au7) = 3.415 ± 0.050

a

[33] and 3.40(3) eV [30] and VDEexpt(Au−

7 ) = 3.46(2) eV [3, 30] and 3.38 eV [33],

respectively. They also fairly agree with previous theoretical data: EAtheor

(Au7) =

a

3.43 eV [30] and VDEtheor(Au−

7 ) = 3.55 eV (obtained with the BP86 and the RECP C

augmented by additional polarization and diﬀuse functions optimized for the neutral

Au3 cluster [13]), 3.43 eV [18], and 3.46 eV [30].

Let us return to the cationic PES of Au7 sketched in Figure 3. Two novel diﬀerent

structures are found on its lowest-energy portion. One, as described above, is the cation

AuI+

7 and the other is a 3D honeycomb-type AuIII+

7

(see Table 3 and note [50]). The

energy diﬀerence between AuIII+

7

and AuI+
7

is 0.1 (0.2) [2.9 (2.9); -1.9 (-2.0)] kcal·mol−1

[51] meaning that the computational level B3LYP/C slightly favors the cation AuIII+

.

7

As shown in Figure 3, this cation AuIII+

7

is not perfectly planar at the B3LYP/A and

B3LYP/B computational levels which predict the dihedral angle 6 Au2Au3Au7Au6 =

31.6o and 31.5o, respectively (B3LYP/C gives only 0.2o and BP86/B does 27.5o). In

summary, it is found for the ﬁrst time that there may be no 2D clusters in the low-

energy section (likely up to the energies of ca. 15 kcal·mol−1; see Ref.

[10] for the

corresponding neutrals) of the cationic PES of seven gold atoms.

To end this Section, let us mention another neutral structure AuIV
7

in the 2A1 state

16

of C2v symmetry (Figure 3 and Table 3) lying 8.5 (8.6) kcal·mol−1 (B3LYP/A) above

AuIII
7

(cf. with 8.3 kcal·mol−1 reported in Ref.

[10]). It possesses spin-up and spin-

down HOMO-LUMO gaps of 1.52 and 1.50 eV, respectively. The related transition-

state double-rhombus structure AuIV ts

7

is also shown in this Figure 3 and determines a

rather high barrier of ≈17.7 kcal·mol−1 governing the breaking of the Au2-Au5 bond.

VI. AuZ
8

It is known that the Au8 cluster is the smallest catalytically active size of gold

clusters [1e].

A binding of a single gold atom Au1 to the Au4-Au5 bond of the AuI

7 cluster leads

to the planar and nonpolar tetracapped square cluster AuI

8 (Figure 4) which is the

global minimum on the neutral PES of eight atom gold clusters. Such a structure has

recently been reported by Bonaˇci´c-Kouteck´y et al. [10, 21] as the true global minimum,

assigned to the 1A1g state of D4h symmetry, in contrast to earlier ﬁndings. The binding

energy of AuI

8, taken relative to the inﬁnitely separated AuI

7 and Au1, is equal to 56.0

(55.6) [56.8 (56.5); 54.6 (54.2)] eV. The EHL gap width amounts to 1.31 eV (BP86/A)

(the B3LYP gives 2.77 [2.72; 2.67] eV).

Structurally, AuI

8 is composed of two kinds of coordinated gold atoms: the four

edged atoms are 2-coordinated while the other four (central square) are 4-coordinated.

The Au-Au bond length between 2- and 4-coordinated atoms is about 0.15 - 0.17 ˚A (see

Table 4) shorter than between each pair of 4-coordinated atoms. Each pair of opposite

atoms belonging to the central square are unbounded, forming thus a sort of hole since

the corresponding distances of ca. 4.0 ˚A exceed twice the van der Waals radius of gold

(3.32 ˚A). It is worth noticing that the formation of AuI

8 from AuI

7 + Au1 requires to

break an Au-Au bond of length ≈ 3.0 ˚A (< 3.32 ˚A) in the internal rhombus of AuI
7.

The two following low-energy structures, AuII

8 and AuIII

8

, have almost the same

17

energy but diﬀer by their 2D - 3D character (see Figure 4 and Table 2). They lie about

11 - 12 kcal·mol−1 above AuI

8 : ∆E(AuII
8

- AuI

8) = 12.5 (12.4) [10.8 (10.7); 11.0 (10.9)]

kcal·mol−1 (and 9.7 (9.6) kcal·mol−1 for the BP86/A) and ∆E(AuIII

8

- AuI

8) = 12.7

(12.6) [13.9 (13.8); 12.8 (12.7)] kcal·mol−1 and are of the same polarity (≈ 0.9 D). One

of them, AuII

8 , is a planar C2v structure that possesses a sixfold coordinated atom at

the center. The other, AuIII

8

, is a novel 3D cluster formed by a Au2 dimer bonded to

the six-gold most stable cluster AuI

6 along its symmetry axis. It possesses four ﬁvefold

coordinated atoms of gold. The diﬀerence between the two clusters is also manifested

in the width of EHL: while for the 3D cluster AuIII

8

, it is closer to that of AuI

8, viz.,

1.86 eV (BP86/A) (B3LYP: 2.95 [2.85; 2.94] eV), its 2D counterpartner has a narrower

one, i. e., 0.87 eV (BP86/A) (B3LYP: 1.76 [1.71; 1.72] eV). These two structures are

slightly below (ca. 3 - 4 kcal·mol−1 depending on the computational level) a pair of less

stable novel 3D clusters, AuIV

8 and AuV

8 shown in Figure 4. AuIV
8

is formed by binding

a gold dimer to AuI

6 along its 3-atom bond whereas in AuV

8 a gold trimer parallel is

attached parallel to AuI

5 (see Figure 1).

While the 3D cluster AuIV
8

is rather far from the global minimum of the neutral

PES, on the cationic one, AuIV +

8

competes with the 2D AuI+

8 and AuII+

8

, and the three

isomers lie at the very bottom of the PES (see Figure 4). More precisely, AuIV +

8

is only

0.1 (0.1) [2.3 (2.3); 1.2 (1.2)] kcal·mol−1 above AuI+

8 which in turn is only 1.7 (1.7) [0.6

(0.6); 0.4 (0.4)] kcal·mol−1 lower than AuII+

8

[52]. This is a manifestation of the 2D

⇔ 3D transition that occurs on the cationic PES of eight gold atoms. The optimized

geometries and some other properties of these three cationic clusters are presented in

Table 5. Notice that the B3LYP/B bond lengths of AuII+

8

are in a good agreement

(within the margin of 0.03 - 0.04 ˚A) with the bond lengths obtained in Ref. [14] using

the BP86 and the RECP C augmented by additional polarization and diﬀuse functions

optimized for the neutral Au3 cluster. The IEa(AuI

8) = 7.88 [7.71; 7.72] eV correlates

18

with the experimental upper limit of 8.65 eV [35]. The IEa(AuII

8 ) = 7.41 [7.27; 7.26]

eV.

That AuI−
8

is the most stable anionic cluster is a well established fact [13].

Its

structure is displayed in Figure 4. Two other low-energy clusters: the planar AuII−

8

which is 7.1 (7.0) [6.9 (6.8); 6.6 (6.6)] kcal·mol−1 higher than AuI−
8

and the three-

dimensional AuIII−

8

lying 21.1 (20.9) [23.4 (23.2); 21.0 (20.8)] kcal·mol−1 higher AuI−
8

are shown in Figure 4 as well (see also Table 5). The HOMO-LUMO gaps of the open-

shell cluster AuI−
8

amounts to 1.01 eV (BP86/A) (cf. B3LYP: 1.69 [1.73; 1.68] eV)

(spin-↑) and 1.31 eV (BP86/A) (cf. B3LYP: 2.51 [2.53; 2.44] eV) (spin-↓), respectively.

The computed adiabatic electron aﬃnity of AuI−
8

is equal to 2.78 [2.74; 2.72] eV in

agreement with the experimental magnitude of 2.764 ± 0.050 eV [33] and 2.73(2) eV

[30] and the theoretical one of 2.88 eV [30]. The VDE of AuI−

8 amounts to 2.88 [2.82;

2.82] eV which is also close to VDEexpt(Au−

8 ) = 2.79 [33] and 2.79(2) eV [30] and

VDEtheor(Au−

8 ) = 3.0 eV (obtained with the BP86 and the RECP C augmented by

additional polarization and diﬀuse functions optimized for the neutral Au3 cluster [13])

and 2.94 eV [30]. Note that the 3D anion AuIII−

8

is stable under attaching e−, that

is, the dianion AuIII2−

8

, which becomes 2D and whose structure is displayed in Figure

4 (see also Table 5), is energetically lower than AuIII−

8

by 14.5 [11.8; 12.2] kcal·mol−1

and therefore exists as a long-lived metastable dianion.

VII. The Low-Energy Section of the PES of Au9

As we have seen in the previous Sections, the planar triangular motif works only

for the neutral and anionic ground-state clusters AuI

6−8 and not for the cationic ones.

Does it mean that it is applicable for all larger clusters or is there some threshold size

of gold clusters for which this structural rule is no longer valid?

We show in this Section that n = 9 is in fact such a threshold. The structures of the

19

low-energy nine gold atom clusters, displayed in Figure 5 (see also Table 6), supports

this conjecture: three of them, a bicapped hexagonal ring AuI

9, AuIII

9

, and AuIV
9

are

2D whereas AuII
9

is 3D. The clusters AuI

9, AuII

9 and AuIV

9 are novel and found in the

present work for the ﬁrst time (cf. the clusters in Refs.

[4, 10]; see notes [53, 54]).

The reported four structures of Au9 can be considered as nearly isoenergetic due to

the deﬁnition of the accepted of the DF/RECP methods for the gold clusters (see Ref.

[10] and Section II).

Comparing the neutral PESs of 6 - 9 gold atoms, we conclude that the three pla-

nar low-energy structures AuI

9, AuIII

9

and AuIV
9

originates from AuI

8, AuI

7 or AuI

6 by

adding one, two or three planar triangles, respectively. On the other hand, the almost

isoenergetic 3D structure AuII
9

is directly obtained from AuI

8 by adding (capping) one

gold atom to its central square and forming thus four new Au-Au bonds, instead of two

as demanded by the planar triangular motif rule. This means that n = 9 is actually

the minimal number of gold atoms for which the above rule is no longer fully valid.

Therefore, the neutral PES of nine gold atoms markedly demonstrates the 2D - 3D

coexistence on its low energy section.

VIII. Summary and Outlook

A variety of novel low-energy 2D and 3D structures have been determined in the

present work on the neutral, cationic and anionic PESs of small gold clusters Au5≤n≤8

and on the neutral PES of Au9. They provide new insights on the 2D - 3D transition

in gold clusters, particularly on their well-known odd- vs. even-sized patterns. The

neutral PES of Au5 shows the presence of two new planar forms, AuIII

5

and AuIV
5 ,

ﬁlling thus the gap of ≈ 21 kcal·mol−1 between the 2D ground-state W-form and the

3D pyramid discussed in Ref. [10]. On the PES of Au7, this gap is signiﬁcantly reduced

to ≈ 6 kcal·mol−1 due to the existence of the novel 3D cluster AuII

7 . For n = 9, the gap

20

is essentially closed: the novel 3D structure AuII

9 coexists on almost equal energetical

footing with three 2D structures, two of which, including the slightly most stable one,

AuI

9, are new as well.

As far as the 2D - 3D coexistence is concerned, the small even-numbered closed-

shell clusters (n ≤ 10) behave quite diﬀerently from the small neutral odd-numbered

open-shell ones. This is particularly true for the PES of Au8 where the lowest-energy

3D cluster AuIII

8

is separated from the 2D ground-state one by ca. 13 kcal·mol−1. We

suggest that this is due to the stronger s − d hybridization in Au2n than in Au2n+1,

at least for 2 ≤ n ≤ 4. Another feature related to the 2D - 3D transition in small

odd-numbered clusters of gold emerges from the present work. This is the behavior

of the gap EHL. The spin-up gap EHL↑ of the ground-stable 2D clusters narrows with

increasing n from 1.57 eV (AuI

5) to 1.32 (AuI

7) and 0.90 eV (AuI

9; the EHL↑ of AuIV

9 =

0.22 eV). On the contrary, for n = 7 and 9, the gap of the lowest-energy 3D clusters

AuII

7 and AuII

9 widens from 0.92 to 1.32 eV. Note that EHL↑ of the 3D cluster AuII
7

is smaller by 0.4 eV than that of the 2D one AuI

7. This implies that the former has

a higher catalytic activity despite its smaller binding energy and therefore deserves to

be experimentally tested. The spin imbalance of the HOMO-LUMO gap, EHL↑ - EHL↓,

decreases from 0.57 eV at n = 5 to 0.28 eV at n = 7 and 0.14 eV at n = 9 (AuI

9).

Novel neutral clusters also lead to interesting features on the charged PESs. One

example: the neutral cluster AuIII

5

gives rise on the anionic PES to the anion AuIII−

5

which has been found to be the most stable one, in contrast with previous experimental

and theoretical works reporting that the ground anionic state is the W-shape structure

AuI−

5 . This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a pair of similar transition

states, one between the ground-state W-form AuI

5 and higher-energy cluster AuIII

5

on

the neutral PES and another between AuI−
5

and AuIII−

5

on the anionic PES. These

transition states govern the breaking of two Au-Au bonds and are therefore charac-

21

terized by rather high barriers (of at least 15 kcal·mol−1 on the neutral PES) which

results in a lifetime of AuI−
5

long enough to be experimentally observed. On the other

hand, the AuIII−

5

isomer, though less reactive than AuI−

5 due to a larger EHL, would be

interesting to detect as well for another two reasons. First, as demonstrated in Section

III, it gives rise to the long-lived metastable 5-gold dianion whose structural pattern is

still present in the 8-gold dianion AuIII2−

8

. Second, the bonding of a single gold atom

to the atom Au3 of AuIII−

5

results in the formation of the anionic cluster AuII−

6 which

lies only 3 - 5 kcal·mol−1 higher the ground-state anion AuI−

6 . Both of them are built,

by analogy with the triangular motif used for neutrals, via the bonding of Au to the

respective 5-gold anions.

As established above, for neutral clusters, the 2D - 3D coexistence takes place only

for the odd-sized open-shell gold cluster Au9. However, it already develops for the

cationic odd-sized closed shell clusters Au+

5 and Au+

7 , although the ways it does for

these two n are essentially diﬀerent. For n = 5, the 2D - 3D transition emerges from

the existence of two almost isoenergetic rotamers: the 2D AuI+
5

and the 3D AuI+′

5

which lacks its neutral 3D parent. On the other hand, the case n = 7 is directly related

to the ionization of the ground-state neutral 2D cluster AuI

7. As noted in Section

V, the ionization weakens the s − d hybridization and thus makes the 2D triangular

motif rule invalid. We suggest that this process occurs via the intermediate planar

transition-state linker AuI+ts

7

which relaxes into the 3D cluster AuII+

7

. In contrast to

the 3D cation AuI+′

5

, AuII+
7

possesses its 3D parent image AuII

7 on the neutral PES

which however, as already discussed above, is less stable than AuI

7. Interestingly, the

3D Zn-analogue of AuII+

7

, where the Zn atom replaces Au4 (or Au5, see Figure 3), is

only 3.2 kcal·mol−1 (B3LYP/A) higher the most planar stable cation Au6Zn+ reported

in Ref.

[20a] (the cluster [6a+] therein), that is, it falls within the DF/RECP error

margin.

22

In addition, the present computational study clearly demonstrates that another

cationic cluster AuIII+

7

(see Figure 3), originating from the neutral planar honeycomb

structure AuIII

7

, is also 3D (at the B3LYP/A and B3LYP/B computational levels). As

reported in Section V, it is almost isoenergetic to AuII+

7 within the DF/RECP error

margin. Moreover, the cation AuIV +

, separated from AuII+

7

7

by about 9.6 kcal·mol−1

(B3LYP/A), is 3D too (see Figure 3). Altogether, this means that in the low-energy

section of the PES of Au+

7 , 3D structures are favored over the 2D ones up to energies

of ca. 15 kcal·mol−1 (see the neutrals in Ref. [10]). In summary, the low-energy portion

(within of ca. 15 kcal·mol−1 from the bottom) of the cationic PES of seven gold atoms

is characterized by a complete absence of 2D clusters. Strickly speaking, the concept

of the 2D - 3D coexistence might then be only valid beyond these energies.

The 2D - 3D coexistence in even-sized open-shell cationic clusters of gold is quite

diﬀerent from that of the odd-sized closed-shell cationic clusters and that of the even-

sized closed-shell neutrals as well. As an example, the novel 3D cation AuIV +

lies

6

only 5 - 7 kcal·mol−1 higher than the almost degenerate ground-state cations AuI+

6 and

AuIII+
6

. At n = 8, the energy oﬀset between the 2D ground-state cluster AuII+

8

and 3D

one AuIV +

8

reduces to ≈ 1 kcal·mol−1 which falls within the DF/RECP computational

error. One may therefore anticipate that the even n = 10 might show the clearcut 2D

- 3D coexistence at the bottom of the PES.

The ﬁnal comment is about the anionic PESs of gold clusters. It has been demon-

strated in the present work that the studied anions hardly manifest the 2D - 3D co-

existence. This conclusion is in agreement with the early ﬁndings by Landman and

co-workers [4, 30]. The most stable 3D cluster which has been reported in this work for

the ﬁrst time is AuIII−

8

. However, it is strongly (by about 21 - 23 kcal·mol−1) separated

from the 2D ground-state cluster AuI−
8 .

[47] Note that the planar structure II reported to be lying 2.26 kcal·mol−1 higher rela-

tive to AuI

7 on the PES of Au7 in Ref. [10] or 0.1 kcal·mol−1 lower in Ref. [3] (see

Figure 1 therein), has not been found in the present work at the B3LYP/A com-

putational level. On the contrary, when taken as the initial geometry, it converges

to AuI

7 under the tight optimization.

[48] Note that the anionic structure 7B reported in Ref. [30] and resembling the struc-

ture of the neutral cluster AuI

7, lying 0.12 kcal·mol−1 higher than AuI−

7 on the PES

of Au−

7 , has not been found in the present work at the B3LYP/A computational

level. As discussed for note [47], when taken as the initial guess, it converges to

AuI−

7 under the tight optimization.

[49] This is a diﬀerence between the results for the ground-state structure on the PES

of the neutral gold cluster of seven atoms, presented in Refs. [4, 10] and this work.

Note that in Ref. [4], AuIII

7 was predicted to be the global minimum.

[50] In some sense, AuIII+

7

resembles the 2D structure of the cation Au+

7 with the D6h

symmetry obtained in Ref. [14]. However, the present B3LYP/A and B3LYP/B

calculations show that AuIII+

7

is undoubtedly a highly-symmetric 3D structure.

[51] It is suggested in Ref. [14] (p. 4099) that ”... several three dimensional structures

... can be ruled out since the lowest is almost 0.5 eV higher in energy and the

cross sections also disagree with measurement - the pentagonal bipyramid (the

lowest 3D structure we found) for example, has a cross section of 61.7 ˚A2 ...”. The

experimental and computed cross sections of AuIII+

7

are correspondingly equal to

30

65.8 and 65.9 ˚A2 [14]. It would be interesting to calculate the collisional cross

section of AuI+
7 .

[52] Notice that Gilb et al. [14] have recently reported two clusters at the bottom of the

PES of Au+

8 . The global minimum is occupied by AuII+

8 which is 1.6 kcal·mol−1

lower compared to AuIV +

8

. As suggested in Ref. [14], the mobility data (69.4 ˚A2)

rules out ”the planar isomer” (AuII+

8

, in the present notations). ”The measured

cross section agrees to within 1% with that of the three dimensional structure”

(AuIV +
8

), ”which means that in this case the lowest energy DFT structure is not

found in the experiment”. We assume that the structure which might be deter-

mined in such ion mobility experiments is referred to AuI+
8

(probably with some

partial weight of AuIV +

8

) which is actually a novel cationic cluster. This assumption

could be veriﬁed by evaluating the cross section of AuI+
8 .

[53] Due to the absence of the structures AuI

9 and AuII
9

in Ref. [10], the most stable

cluster was assigned to AuIII

.

9

[54] All structures AuI−IV

9

are found on the anionic PES in Ref. [13]. Therein, AuIII−

is

9

the most stable one followed by AuI−

9 with the energy diﬀerence of 4.8 kcal·mol−1.

The next is a 3D structure AuII−

9

separated from AuIII−

9

by 9.0 kcal·mol−1 and

the last is a planar cluster AuIV −

lying 17.8 kcal·mol−1 higher AuIII−

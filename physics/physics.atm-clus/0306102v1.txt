In this paper we examine the behavior of small cluster of atoms in a short (10–50 fs) very intense
hard x-ray (10 keV) pulse. We use numerical modeling based on the non-relativistic classical equation
of motion. Quantum processes are taken into account by the respective cross sections. We show
that there is a Coulomb explosion, which has a diﬀerent dynamics than one ﬁnds in classical laser
driven cluster explosions. We discuss the consequences of our results to single molecule imaging by
the free electron laser pulses.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, there is a growing interest in the interaction
of high intensity electromagnetic ﬁeld with solids and
small clusters of atoms. This interest is driven by two
sources: i. by the availability of short-pulse high-power
laser sources in the few hundred nm wavelength range,
and ii. by the fact that the building of linac-based free-
electron laser type hard x-ray sources became a reality.1,2
In the case of the long wavelength laser radiation the in-
terest shifted from the bulk-ﬁeld to the cluster-ﬁeld inter-
action. The cause of this is that the behavior of clusters
under the inﬂuence of intense laser ﬁeld shows several
peculiarities. First, there is a photo induced Coulomb
explosion.3 Second, the interaction is much more ener-
getic than that of isolated atoms.4,5 Third, highly ion-
ized states of the atoms appear.4 Fourth, lately it was
shown that even laser driven nuclear fusion could take
place in small clusters of deuterium atoms.6 This could
eventually lead to the development of tabletop neutron
sources.

On the other hand, short-pulsed intense hard x-ray
sources also promise unique applications: the high energy
of these photons allows time dependent spectroscopic in-
vestigations of deep atomic levels, the short wavelength
makes possible structural investigations with atomic res-
olution on a time scale of 100 fs. So we can follow chem-
ical reactions and biological processes in time. One can
even think of imaging individual molecules, viruses or
clusters of atoms and molecules using the very intense
and short pulses of these x-ray sources.7 Further, we
could study exotic states of matter such as warm dense
matter, etc.8,9 The treatment of the high-energy case re-
quires a very diﬀerent approach than the low photon en-
ergies. The reason is twofold: practical and theoretical.
From the practical point of view the production of an
intense hard x-ray photon beam requires many km long
facility, which costs hundreds of millions of dollars, while
a high power infrared laser source can be realized in nor-
mal laboratory environment for less then a million dol-
lar. This diﬀerence results in a very diﬀerent research
strategy. While in the long wavelength case theory and

experiments develop parallel, in the x-ray case no exper-
iment can be done presently. However, there is a strong
need for model calculations, which can predict the be-
havior of diﬀerent forms of matter under the inﬂuence of
intense x-ray beam. This information is necessary, be-
cause planning these large machines and working out the
scientiﬁc case, one has to know how the optical elements
and the sample will behave in the beam. Based on this
we can plan future experiments and determine what kind
of information can be gained from them.

This leads to the theoretical side. It is clear that in
the x-ray case, the high energy of a single photon allows
direct interaction with core electrons, so the ionization
mechanism signiﬁcantly diﬀers from that of the low en-
ergy laser photons. This requires a diﬀerent theoretical
approach. We expect that quantum mechanics and quan-
tum electrodynamics should be more often invoked than
in the low energy case.

At the same time we know that the exact quantum
treatment of a thousand particle system in intense elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is out of the reach of present day com-
puter capabilities. Therefore one has to ﬁnd a border
where quantum and classical description meet, mean-
while the behavior of the model system is not distorted
signiﬁcantly. The ﬁrst steps in this direction have been
done. There have been model calculations, which statis-
tically describe a system after a single primary ionization
event.10,11

In this paper we describe a model calculation for the
dynamics of atoms, ions, and electrons in a cluster, dur-
ing an intense hard x-ray pulse. In this case many con-
secutive ionization (energy deposition) events in the sys-
tem drive the cluster to highly ionized states, leading to

classical particles solving the classical equation of mo-
tion. The quantum mechanics and the quantum electro-
dynamics are included through cross sections. In practice
it means that the various events are taken into account by
diﬀerent probabilities. The motivation of these calcula-
tions comes from two sources: in one hand we would like
to see the diﬀerence in the Coulomb explosions caused
by low and high-energy photons. Secondly, we would

like to examine, how realistic the single particle imaging
by high intensity fs x-ray pulses is. In this article we con-
centrate on the Coulomb explosion and give only a brief
comment on single particle imaging. The reason for this
is that the imaging problem is very complex, it requires
not only the knowledge of the dynamics of the cluster,
but also the calculation of the intensity distribution of
elastic and inelastic x-ray scattering and the reconstruc-
tion of atomic order from the scattering pattern. These
questions will be addressed in forthcoming papers.

II. MODEL

In order to do a realistic modeling we have to use in-
put parameters typical for the future linac based x-ray
sources. Therefore, we give the relevant characteristics
of these sources below: the pulse shape is gaussian with
full widths at half maximum F W HM = 10 and 50 fs;
the number of photons/pulse is Nph = 5 ∗ 1012 ; the di-
ameter of the probe beam at the sample is d = 100 nm
(by focusing); the energy of the beam is E = 10 keV
and it is linearly polarized. Before we continue with the
description of our model, we would like to introduce a
terminology: we will call a single x-ray pulse and all the
events in the cluster from the start of the pulse to the
end of it an “experiment”.

Since our aim is the determination of the charge dis-
tribution in space and time, we follow every individual
particle (atoms, ions, and electrons). This means the nu-
merical solution of the classical equation of motion for
all particles. Quantum mechanics is included via cross
sections, and taking into account discrete atomic energy
levels in the ionization process. Here we would like to
call the attention to a diﬀerence between calculations in

it can
the laser ﬁeld acts on the particles in two ways:
strip weakly bound electrons by multiphoton process or
optical tunneling, and it accelerates the ions and elec-
trons as a classical ﬁeld. The charged particles move
large distances (compared to the cluster size) during half
period of the ﬁeld, which can be taken as homogeneous
within the cluster, since the wavelength is much larger
than the cluster size. In the x-ray case, the ﬁeld is chang-
ing very fast both in time and space, so that there is no
time for a particle to gain appreciable velocity and to
move large distance12 during half period of the incident
beam. Therefore the x-ray ﬁeld as a classical ﬁeld can
be neglected in the equation of motions. So the most im-
portant interaction, which alters the motion of charged
particles, is the Coulomb interaction. This is taken into
account in our calculations and the Coulomb interaction
is not cut at any distance. However, close to the nuclei
the Coulomb potential is regularized for two reasons: we
know that in the vicinity of the nuclei the atomic elec-
trons modify the pure Coulomb potential. Secondly, in
the classical picture an electron could go very close to the
positive nucleus and in this case the potential diverges to

inﬁnity, which cannot be handled numerically. Therefore
in practice we use the following formula for the Coulomb
r2 + r2
interaction: U (r) = q/
0, where r0 was chosen in
a way, not to violate the energy conservation within the
numerical error.13

p

The next approximation, which we have to mention, is
the non-relativistic approach. This is justiﬁed by the low
maximum velocity of electrons, which can be estimated
from the incident photon energy and the binding energy
of the electrons. Taking the parameters of the incident
beam, the upper limit for electron energy is 10 keV. This
corresponds to a velocity of about 1/5th of the velocity
of light. Therefore the non-relativistic treatment is jus-
tiﬁed.

At last we would like to specify the cross sections.
Analyzing the possible scattering processes we arrive at
two types of cross sections: photon-particle and particle-
particle.
In the former we include photon-electron,
photon-atom, and photon-ion cross sections. Photons
with free electrons interact via Compton scattering. The
diﬀerential and total cross sections for this process are
given in quantum electrodynamics handbooks.14 Using
the total Compton cross-section and the parameters of
our experiment we can estimate the number of Comp-
ton scattered photons during the full length of the x-ray
pulse. We get about 200 Compton scattering events in a
1500 atom system. This low number means that Comp-
ton scattering does not alter the time evolution of the
charge distribution at a detectable level. Therefore we
neglect it in the calculations.
In the case of strongly
bound electrons the dominating process is the photo ef-
fect. This is true for atoms and also for ions provided that
they have electrons left on deep core levels. Photo eﬀect
cross section data for ions were extrapolated from the
atomic values.14 Two approximations were used: ﬁrst, we
neglected the change of the wave function of the atomic
electrons on removing electrons from the atom. Second,
the probability of the photo eﬀect was normalized to one
electron (at a given state), and depending on the ion-
ization state it was scaled by the number of electrons
actually present on the ion at the state under considera-
tion. The last possibility for the photon-atom interaction
is the ﬂuorescent process. In our case (low Z sample) the
probability of the ﬂuorescent decay is low compared to
the Auger process.15

Considering the particle-particle type interactions, we
can list atom-atom, atom-ion,
ion-ion, electron-atom,
electron-ion, and electron-electron interactions. We do
not use explicitly cross sections for atom-atom and atom-
ion collisions. The reason is that these collisions come
into play only at the very beginning of the x-ray pulse,
since atoms are very rapidly ionized at the rising edge
of the pulse and between ions the Coulomb interaction
dominates. For those few atoms, which are not ionized
the van der Waals type interaction which we use to mimic
chemical bonding describes well enough the atom-atom
and atom-ion collisions.

Ion-ion and electron-electron interactions are taken

into account directly by the Coulomb interaction. Al-
though this way quantum eﬀects (like exchange interac-
tion) are neglected, we expect that at the given experi-
mental conditions (energy, density etc.), their contribu-
tion is minor.

The remaining two interactions, electron-atom and
electron-ion are the most important ones. We can dis-
tinguish three types: the Auger process, the elastic scat-
tering of electrons, and the secondary (often called im-
pact) ionization by electrons. In the Auger process an
electron from a higher level drops into a K hole (cre-
ated previously in the photo eﬀect), meanwhile an other
electron from the higher level is emitted taking the ex-
cess energy. The lifetime for this process was taken from
Ref. 16. Probabilities were scaled similarly to the photo
eﬀect, using the values given for the basic Auger process.
The next interaction is the elastic scattering of elec-
trons on atoms and ions. This does not play an impor-
tant role in the time evolution of charge distribution. The
reason is that this process does not change the number of
charges, only the direction of their velocity. We checked
the validity of the above statement by carrying out cal-
culations with diﬀerent elastic cross sections. We tried
both isotropic and non-isotropic cross sections17 and we
did calculations without electron-atom elastic scattering.
We found that there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
time dependence of the charge distributions among the
three types of calculations. Therefore we switched oﬀ
atom-electron elastic scattering. We have to mention,
that part of the elastic scattering, namely the electron-ion
interaction is taken into account anyway by the Coulomb
interaction, which is present for all charged particles in
the system.

In the secondary ionization an electron with high
enough energy interacts with an atom or ion kicking out
an electron from a bound state, meanwhile its kinetic en-
ergy decreases (so in this process the number of charges
changes).
It is clear from the literature that with the
decrease of the energy the cross section of this process
increases. However, at very low energies (below 80 eV)
this tendency changes, and the incident electron energy
dependence of the cross section shows a rapid decrease
(Fig. 1). All in all in the lowest 80 eV region the de-
scription of the cross section of the secondary ionization
by electrons is problematic. Beside the atomic properties
the details depend strongly on the chemical bonding and
geometrical arrangement of atoms. Since in this region
the cross section values derived from diﬀerent theoretical
approaches18,19,20,21 diﬀer signiﬁcantly and experimen-
tal data are scarce we tried two approaches with 50 and
80 eV turning points for a 1500 atom cluster and 50 fs
pulse width. We found small diﬀerences in the cluster
dynamics. These appeared close to the end of the x-ray
pulse. The changes was so small that they do not eﬀect
the conclusions we draw from the calculations. Therefore
in all the other calculations we used the 50 eV turning
point curve for the cross section of the secondary electron
ionization.

FIG. 1: Cross section of electron impact ionization vs.
in-
coming electron energy for neutral carbon atoms. The inset
shows the cross section enlarged in the low energy regime.
Note that for ions the cross section is diﬀerent according to
Eq. (1). The mean free path dynamically changes because of
the inhomogen time-dependent atom-density.

In what follows we describe the mechanism of the mod-
eling. The calculation proceeds via time steps. The typ-
ical value of a step is 10−3 fs. In every time steps two
actions are done:

i. Monte Carlo (M.C.)
ii. Solving the equation of motion

In the M.C. sub-step we examine for all particles if any
process (taken into account by cross sections) happened
or not. Therefore the probabilities of the photo eﬀect
and Auger process are normalized to one time step. For
every atom and ion random numbers are generated to
decide if these processes had taken place. The secondary
ionization is calculated in a diﬀerent way. First, the near
neighbor atoms and the relative atom-electron velocities
are determined for every electron. We attach to the elec-
tron a circular plate perpendicular to its velocity. The
area of this plate is equal to the cross section. This plate
moves together with the electron sweeping a cylindrical
volume. If in this volume there is an atom having bound
electrons with low enough energy to kick out, a secondary
ionization does happen.

At this point it is appropriate to discuss a delicate
question: how we create a new particle in our classical
model. This is the point where the classical and quan-
tum picture have to be smoothly joined. It is clear from
the above description of the model that electrons appear
in the case of photo eﬀect, Auger process, and secondary
ionization. Let us start with the simplest case of the
photo eﬀect. This seems straightforward, since a photon
comes in, and it looses all of its energy, which is given to
one atomic electron. This simple picture is true if we look
at the initial state as an atom at the origin and a photon
at inﬁnite and the ﬁnal state as an ion in the origin and a
kicked out electron at the inﬁnite. However, in our calcu-
lations we follow the path of every particle, and we know

p

that the stripped electron continuously moves out from
the atom under consideration. On its path it interacts
with other atoms, ions, and electrons present in the sam-
ple. Therefore we have to place the electron somewhere
close to its parent atom and not at inﬁnite. This raises
two questions: where and with what velocity to put this
electron. We use diﬀerent values for K and L electrons.
These values can be directly calculated using two plau-
sibile assumptions: i. the distance and the magnitude of
the velocity are ﬁxed for a given shell independently of
the ionization state of the atom; ii. conservation of en-
ergy is satisﬁed. This way we arrive to distances about
the Bohr radius, which is a natural border of the atom
in the classical picture. The velocity cannot be simply
v =
2Ephoton/mel − 2Ebinding/mel because the elec-
tron should have this velocity at inﬁnite distance from
the ion. If we put the electron close to its parent atom,
which is now a positive ion, the electron would slow down
going to inﬁnity. Therefore we have to give the electron
a larger velocity to compensate this slowing down. If we
want to be more precise, we have to take into account
the ﬁeld caused by all other charged particles (though
in practice the leading term is the Coulomb potential of
the closest ion). The last problem is the direction of the
electron’s velocity. The angular dependence of the cross
section of the photo eﬀect is given in handbooks14 for a
linearly polarized incident photon. Therefore we use ran-
dom directions with a distribution corresponding to the
theoretical cross section. The direction of the velocity
ﬁxes the position of the exact placement, since we put
the electron in a way that it moves out radially from the
atom. At last we have to mention that the energy and
momentum conservations are satisﬁed in this process, so
the ion takes recoil energy. For placing the electron in the
Auger process, a similar mechanism is used. However, in
the case of secondary ionization there is a signiﬁcant dif-
ference. The cause is that here we have a three body
problem. In this case we have an electron and an atom
(or ion) in the initial state and two electrons and an ion in
the ﬁnal state. Placing the electrons with the proper ve-
locities is not straightforward. The ﬁrst problem is that
there is no reliable data for the angular dependence of the
cross section of inelastic electron scattering. The simplest
assumption is an isotropic emission of the secondary elec-
trons and we use this in the calculations. To see the eﬀect
of non-isotropic emission we did model calculations with
an angular distribution derived from quantum mechani-
cal calculations.17 There was a small change in the time
evolution of the system. So our assumption of isotropic
emission was justiﬁed. For the energy dependence of the
cross section we use a parameterized formula22:

u = U/B, S = 4πa2
R = 13.6057 eV , the dipole constant Q is approximated
with 1, and n is a value near 1 used for ions.22

The above parameters are based on experimental
data.22 Further, we correct this velocity to get the lo-
cal velocity in a similar way as it was done for the Auger
and photoelectrons. Now we should ﬁx the velocity and
position of the kicked out electron. However, this cannot
be done simply, because we have a three body problem,
and the energy and momentum conservation do not de-
termine unambiguously the velocity of the ion and the
primary electron after scattering. Therefore we assume,
that the scattering of the incident electron is in the plane
determined by the velocity of the primary electron before
scattering and the vector pointing from the nucleus to the
primary electron.

At this point the M.C. sub-step is ﬁnished. The next
sub-step is solving the equation of motion. First we cal-
culate the resultant force for every particle. Starting from
the forces, the new velocities and positions are calculated
using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method.

At the end of this section we describe the clusters in-
vestigated in this study. As model systems we chose
monatomic all carbon clusters. The atoms were held to-
gether by simple central forces only. We used the follow-
ing potential function:

where the values of VC and σ parameters are chosen to
have the minimum of the potential at r = 1.5 ˚A with
the depth of 3.5 eV. Starting atomic positions were sim-
ple cubic or face-centered cubic ordered, or the above
but with randomized positions about the lattice sites
(we used max(|∆a|/a) = 0.05 ,where ∆a is the devia-
tion from the ideal lattice site, while “a” is the lattice
spacing). We found that the actual starting atomic con-
ﬁguration hardly alters the explosion dynamics, as far as
the ﬁrst neighbor distance is kept the same. Therefore
in what follows we show the results of calculations on
clusters with the simple cubic atomic order.

III. RESULTS

Before we show statistics, distributions, energy spec-
tra etc. we would like to outline what type of informa-
tion we seek and how we estimate the precision of our
predictions.23 Our aim is to map the characteristic be-
havior of clusters as a function of the size of the cluster
(number of particles) and the length of the x-ray pulse.
In size we covered the range from 50–1500 atoms/cluster.
The pulse widths are F W HM = 10 and 50 fs. The most
important features what we are interested in are: the
total number of stripped electrons, the spatial and en-
ergy distributions of atoms, ions, and electrons, and the
number of stripped electrons in the beam.

To see the eﬀect and the importance of diﬀerent inter-
actions governing the time evolution of the system, we

diﬀerent interactions step by step. In the ﬁrst one (refer-
ring later as model I.) there are photo eﬀect, Auger pro-
cess, and Coulomb interaction between ions. However,
the photo and Auger electrons leave the system without
any interaction (we repeated the calculation of Neutze et
al.7 for our model system). It is clear that in these cal-
culations we make two errors: ﬁrst we underestimate the
number of stripped electrons, since the photo and Auger
electrons do not kick out further electrons from the atoms
and ions. Secondly the rate at which the charge state of
the cluster as a whole increases, is overestimated. This
comes from the fact, that the positive ions attract elec-
trons, so that the slower Auger electrons are unable to
escape. At later times (i.e. for large charge state of the
cluster, Q > 104e) even the faster photoelectrons are
signiﬁcantly slowed down decreasing the temporary net
charge of the cluster.

The underestimate in the number of stripped electrons
means that the radiation damage is larger in reality than
in the calculation of Neutze et al.7 However, this dam-
age means a change in the charge state of the atoms and
it does not necessary followed by a change in the posi-
tion of atoms. Actually we expect slower increase of the
positional disorder than predicted in Ref. 7 because of
the overestimated total charge. In a real system a slower
increase of the charge would lead to a milder Coulomb
explosion.

In the second type of calculations (model II) we have
the same interactions as in the ﬁrst one, however, not
only the ions but also the photo and Auger electrons
interact by the Coulomb interaction. With this modiﬁ-
cation we correct for the above-mentioned overestimate.
However, the total number of ionizations, which is im-
portant from the point of view of plasma dynamics, stays
much behind the reality.

Therefore, in the third type of calculation (model III)
we introduced inelastic electron-atom and electron-ion
scattering in addition to the eﬀects taken into account
earlier. That results in the appearance of secondary elec-
trons. However, in this case the number of stripped elec-
trons is overestimated. This comes from the fact that in
the classical equation of motion, atomic and ionic or-
bits are not quantized. Therefore a classical electron
(stripped electron in our calculations) can drop very deep
into the potential well of an ion, meanwhile the secondary
electron takes the excess energy in the form of kinetic en-
ergy. This results in more stripped electrons, as we would
have in reality.
In order to compensate for this eﬀect
we did not allow negative binding energies between the
two electrons participating in the process and their near-
est neighbor ion. However, even with this adjustment a
slight overestimate is expected for the number of stripped
electrons, because electronic relaxation, recombination is
not taken into account. They were left out because ac-
cording to experiments24,25 and theoretical estimates17,

these processes have very small probabilities on the time
scale we are interested in.

The results we present are based on hundreds of calcu-
lations. Beside doing calculations for the diﬀerent mod-
els and various cluster sizes, we also followed several in-
dependent explosions with the same parameters except
using diﬀerent series of random numbers. This way we
could check the sensitivity of parameters to the stochas-
tic nature of the processes. We found that the statistical
uncertainty was about 5% for the 50-atom clusters and
this ﬂuctuation signiﬁcantly decreased for larger clusters.
The various parameters shown in the following ﬁgures are
the result of averages of independent explosions.It is clear
that we cannot show all the curves and real space distri-
butions. Therefore, ﬁrst we show typical results of one
model calculation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3) and explain the main
features of these ﬁgures. Then in the next part, the dif-
ferent types of calculations will be compared and at the
end the dynamics of the Coulomb explosion will be given
for various cluster sizes and pulse lengths based on the
most realistic model.

We have chosen for demonstration a 1500-carbon atom
cluster. The atoms are arranged in a simpe cubic lattice
with lattice spacing of a = 1.5˚A and the starting atomic
positions randomized about the regular lattice sites as de-
scribed earlier. The pulse length is 50 fs and 5 ∗ 1012 pho-
tons are in a pulse. According to the categorization given
earlier, the calculation is in the third category (all inter-
actions are included). On Fig. 2(a) we show the number
of diﬀerent type of particles as a function of time. Since
we do classical calculations, we can ﬂag electrons by their
origin. That allows us to distinguish Auger, photo and
secondary electrons. The curve labeled stripped electrons
in the beam needs further explanation. It is calculated
by counting the number of electrons in the volume of a
1000 ˚A diameter cylinder with its axis coinciding with the
x-ray beam. The signiﬁcance of this curve is that it allows
to estimate the number of inelastically scattered photons
of the incident beam. All numbers are normalized by the
total number of electrons present in the sample at zero
time. On Fig. 2(b), (c) and (d) we show the time evolu-
tion of the spatial distribution of stripped electrons, ions
and the total charge respectively. The horizontal axis
corresponds to the real space distance from the center
of mass. The vertical axis denotes the time. The colors
show the number of electrons in a spherical shell with a
width of 1 ˚A radius corresponding to the values on the
horizontal axis. On Fig. 3. the cluster in real space is
shown as if it were photographed at diﬀerent times. At
this point we do not want to analyze Fig. 2 and 3 in de-
tails but we point out a few features characteristic for all
calculations: (i) atoms lose a signiﬁcant number (∼ 70%)
of their bound electrons within the ﬁrst half of the x-ray
pulse, (ii) photoelectrons leave the cluster shortly after
their emission (but a signiﬁcant number are in the beam),
(iii) The butterﬂy shaped spatial distribution of photo-
electrons reﬂects the direction of polarization of the in-
cident beam. (iv) The cluster looses its nuclear topology

initial conﬁguration of the cluster enlarged on the upper left part of (a). We used opposite zooming on (d) in order to show the
photoelectrons escaped far away from the cluster. Mostly Auger and secondary electrons concentrate at the center (c), whereas
photoelectrons are leaving the system forming a butterﬂy-shaped cloud (d), reﬂecting the anisotropy of the photoeﬀect in the
linearly polarized x-ray.

very early during the pulse (well before half of the pho-
tons hit the sample).

After introducing the parameters, which characterize
the explosion, we compare ﬁner details predicted by dif-
ferent models (the three diﬀerent types of calculations,
introduced previously). We used the same parameters of
the cluster and the pulse as in the experiment described
in the previous paragraph. On Fig. 4(a),(b), and (c) the

ﬂects those features discussed earlier in this section: the
ﬁrst type of calculation overestimates the increase of the
charge [Fig. 4(b)], and it underestimates the ionization
rate of atoms [Fig. 4 (a)]. Including Coulomb interaction
for all charged particles (second type of calculation) we
correct somewhat for the overestimate. This is best seen
on the charge [Fig. 4(b)], but it also changes the dynam-
ics of the Coulomb explosion, see the time dependence

of R(t) [Fig. 4(c)]. We expect that the true behavior of
the cluster is closest to the third type of calculations in
which all interactions are taken into account. Therefore,
in what follows we show the results of the third type of
calculations only.

First we analyze the dynamics of the Coulomb explo-
sion as a function of cluster size and pulse length.
In
Fig. 5 and 6 we depicted the time dependence of the
number of stripped electrons, the average charge/ion, and
the normalized cluster size (RN (t) = R(t)/R(−∞) ) for
systems containing 50, 100, 200, 500, or 1500 particles.
The pulse length was 10 fs and 50 fs respectively.

Let us start with the discussion of Fig. 5(a) and 6(a).
There is a trend in the number of stripped electrons with
the cluster size: the larger the cluster the faster the ion-
ization. This can be explained by the secondary ioniza-
tion, since for small clusters there is a larger chance for
Auger and photoelectrons to leave the system without
kicking out another electron. For ﬁrst sight Fig. 5(b)
[ 6(b)] and 5(c) [ 6(c)] contradict Fig. 5(a) [ 6(a)], since
the normalized size of the clusters and the average charge
of the particles increase more slowly for larger clusters.

FIG. 6: Time evolution of the number of stripped electrons (a), the average total charge of the cluster per atom (b), and the
radius of the cluster (normalized by the initial cluster radius) (c), in a 50 fs x-ray pulse. Various curve types correspond to
clusters containing diﬀerent number of atoms.

The explanation of this eﬀect is that photo and Auger
electrons loose their energy on secondary ionization and
their remaining kinetic energy is not enough to escape
from the Coulomb attraction of the positive net charge
of the cluster. These slow electrons shield the ion-ion re-
pulsive Coulomb interaction, leading to slower Coulomb
explosion of larger clusters.

Beside the time dependence of the number of “free”
charges, their spatial distributions are also important
characteristics of the explosion.
In Fig. 7 the radial
charge distributions are shown for a 500 (a) and a 1500
(b) atom cluster, at the end of a pulse with F W HM =
50 fs. The behavior of the systems are similar in the case
of a 10 fs pulse, therefore we do not show that ﬁgure
separately. Note that there is a step in the charge dis-
tributions. We have an almost neutral plasma in the
central part of the cluster and a highly charged shell
around it. This charge distribution is formed from highly
charged individual ions and electrons. To illustrate this,
we depicted the charge distribution of ions independently.
Note, that the degree of ionization is almost constant ev-
erywhere, it does not follow the net charge curve. There-
fore the charge distribution is formed from highly charged
ions and electrons and it is not the result of a high concen-
tration of neutral atoms in the center part. In the follow-
ing we discuss this peculiar charge distribution in more
details. We show that the two spatially separated re-
gions have diﬀerent characteristics in the energy domain
and that the border of these regions moves out contin-
uously. We demonstrate this for large clusters, but one
ﬁnds similar behavior for smaller ones. We chose large
systems because for small clusters (50–100 atoms) the
deﬁnition of the border between the two regions is less
precise. Fig. 8(a) and (b) show the energy distributions
of ions at various times during the pulse for a 500 and
1500 particle cluster, respectively. There are two char-
acteristic features: (i) The energy scale is going up to
the many keV range, and (ii) there are two regions in
energy, a low energy peak and a long high energy tail.
We deﬁned a border between the two regions as the zero
crossing of a straight line ﬁtted to the steepest part of

the energy distribution curve. Note that at the begin-
ning of the pulse there is a time interval (or a minimum
number of incident photons), for which the two regions
cannot be deﬁned, because there is not enough time and
free electrons and ions to form these regions. In this par-
ticular case this interval extends to about −15 f s. We
examined the characteristics of these regions separately.
In
First we show the spatial distribution of the ions.
Fig. 8(c) a typical curve of the number of ions as a func-
tion of the distance (r) from the center of mass is shown.
The number of ions was calculated by counting the ions
in 1 ˚A thick spherical shells with diﬀerent radiuses (r).
The spatial distribution shows a similar shape as the en-
ergy distribution. It seems that the resemblance is not
accidental, the separation in energy is connected to a
separation in space: the low energy ions are close to the
center, in the ﬁrst peak; up to 80 ˚A. The ions in the
high energy tail are further away, in the tail of the spa-
tial distribution curve. This stronger correlation can be
observed by plotting the average energy of ions as a func-
tion of the distance from the center of mass [Fig. 8(d)].
A monotonic increase of the energy with the distance is
observable. One can ﬁt this curve by the sum of two
linear functions. Their crossing coincides with the bor-
der of the almost neutral plasma and the highly charged
outer shell, further emphasizing the distinction between
the two regions. We can get an estimate for the speed
of the Coulomb explosion from the motion of the bor-
der. We plotted the position of the border as a function
of time on Fig. 9. According to this, the border moves
out with about 1.1 ˚A/fs velocity, which corresponds to
∼ 700 eV ion energy.

So far we examined the spatial and energy distribution
of ions. In the next part we characterize the electrons.
In Fig. 10(a)–(c) the energy distributions of electrons are
shown for various cluster sizes (100, 500, and 1500) and
at diﬀerent times for pulse width of 50 fs. The com-
bined eﬀect of secondary ionization and expansion of the
cluster is observable. As we approach the end of the
pulse the energy distribution of electrons gets narrower,
more electrons “condense” to small energies. This ef-

fect is more pronounced for larger systems, in which the
secondary ionization is more eﬀective.
In order to es-
timate the eﬀect of secondary ionization, we calculated
the energy distribution for models without the secondary
ionization. The result is shown in Fig. 10(d) for a 50 fs
pulse width and 1500 particle system. Comparing this
distribution to that of Fig. 10(c) (the same system with
secondary ionization), diﬀerences can be observed. The
ﬁrst general impression is that much less electrons are
stripped. This is not surprising since we turned oﬀ an
ionization process. The second feature is that the distri-
butions get wider. This feature is more pronounced at
the early time of the pulse.

Beside the above features of the energy distributions
we can try to connect the energy to thermodynamic pa-
rameters. It is clear that the system is small and far from
equilibrium, so thermodynamic parameters are hard to

the ion density, and the ion density as a function of the
The
time, on Fig. 11(a), (b), and (c).
E(ρ) function of ions is characteristic for an exploding
system, which we pump energy into. The energy has a
rapid nonlinear increase at low densities. The electrons
behave very diﬀerently, they are almost decoupled from
the ions. Their energy is slightly, linearly decreasing with
the density. A deviation from this behavior can be seen
at very low and high densities. On the low density re-
gion there is a drop [see Fig. 11(b)] and at high densities
there is a ﬂuctuation in the energy. The drop is caused
by the simultaneous eﬀect of two factors: the decrease of
energy deposition by the incident photon beam and the
expansion of the cluster. The ﬂuctuation is a result of
the low number of stripped electrons and the very high
energy of photoelectrons. High density appears at the
early time of the pulse. However, this time the number
of stripped electrons is very low, and mostly photoelec-
trons are present. If one or more of these high energy
(∼10 keV) photoelectrons are in the cluster, where we
calculate density and energy distribution, we get a high
average. However, as the number of the secondary and
Auger electrons increase, the weight of photoelectrons
becomes small. On Fig. 11(c) the time dependence of
the ion density is shown. There is a narrow time inter-
val (centered about −20 fs), where a large drop in the
density takes place.

Before we ﬁnish the discussion of the results of our
model calculations, we compare our ﬁndings to calcu-
lations published earlier. Unfortunately, there are not
many works on this topic. The closest to our modeling
is the calculation of Neutze et al.,7 which we have men-
tioned earlier in the paper. However, the aim of that
work was not to give a detailed analysis of the plasma
and its time evolution but to get an impression on the
feasibility of single molecule imaging. Since in that pa-
per there was no detailed data on the spatial, time and
energy distributions of particles, we repeated that type
of calculations with the same parameters we used in our
modeling (these calculations correspond to the ﬁrst type
of modeling, according to our categorization introduced
earlier). The basic diﬀerences between our modeling and
the calculation performed in Ref. 7 is that we follow all
stripped electrons (we do not remove them from the sys-
tem), and all charged particles interact by Coulomb inter-
action. In addition to this, the electrons are also inelasti-
cally scattered by atoms and ions. These diﬀerences have
two consequences:
in one hand the ionization of atoms
are faster, but at the same time the Coulomb explosion
is moderated by the electron cloud formed by slow elec-
trons. This results in a diﬀerent explosion dynamics, and
spatial charge and energy distributions. We ﬁnd an al-
most neutral central core expanding by 1.1 ˚A/fs velocity,
and a positively charged shell formed by fast highly ion-
ized ions about this core. In Neutze ’s model this type of
charge distribution does not develop.

Recently, there has been another publication on cluster

much lower (350 eV) than in our modeling (10 keV).
Therefore our ﬁndings diﬀer from those of Ref. 26. How-
ever, there are two similarities:
ionization starts from
inner shells, and the incident beam does not give ap-
preciable velocity to charged particles, and therefore it
causes negligible spatial oscillation.

The third type of works, which we can compare our
calculations to are the works on the classical laser driven
Coulomb explosion of small clusters. There have been ex-
tensive theoretical and experimental investigations in this
area.27,28,29,30,31 Comparing results we ﬁnd substantial
diﬀerences in every respects: spatial charge distribution,
energy distribution and in time dependence. This is not
surprising, since the underlying processes are diﬀerent.
The diﬀerence originates from the very long wavelength
(hundreds of nm-s) of the incident beam compared to our
case (0.1 nm). The consequences of the large wavelength
are: at a given time the full cluster sees the same ﬁeld;
the direction of this ﬁeld changes slowly compared to
the time an electron moves about the cluster size; single
photon energy is not enough to strip bound electrons.

the time dependence of the average atomic density (N = 1500, F W HM = 50 f s).

Since in the x-ray case we are in the opposite limits,
the behavior of the cluster in the short x-ray and laser
pulse is very diﬀerent. This diﬀerence already manifests
in the ionization process. While in the classical laser case
the ionization proceeds by multiphoton ionization from
outer shells and it is followed by impact ionization via the
stripped fast electrons accelerated by the ﬁeld. In the x-

ray case the ﬁeld of the incident beam does not play such
an important role, since it does not accelerate stripped
electrons to high velocities. The cause of this is that the
ﬁeld direction is changing so fast that charged particles
can not gain appreciable velocity in this period. There-
fore Auger and secondary electrons stay in the cluster,
and as the cluster of ions expands the electrons condense

are shown as a function of time.32

to low energies. These electrons slow down the Coulomb
explosion, especially in the inner core of the ion cluster.
This very diﬀerent explosion dynamics also reﬂects in the
energy distribution of ions. In the x-ray case the typi-
cal ion energies are much lower. They are in the 10 keV
range as compared to the hundreds of keV found in clas-
sical laser driven Coulomb explosions.

After ﬁnishing the characterization of the Coulomb ex-
plosion, a few words are appropriate about the time scale
in which the validity of our model calculation is justiﬁed.
A limit is given by the recombination processes, which
we neglected. Recombination plays an important role if a
large ratio of the electrons localize about ions with small
energy. To see this, we counted how many electrons stay
at an ion for long periods.32 This is shown on Fig. 12(a)
and (b) for 10 and 50 fs pulse width. The result correlates
very well with the energy distribution given in Fig. 8, 10,
and 11. As the energy of the particles and the density de-
creases, the temporary localization increases. However,
even in the worst case, approximately 50% of the pho-
tons stay about 10 fs at a given site. Comparing this to
typical recombination times (1000 fs), the probability of
the recombination is small.

FIG. 13: R-factors calculated from the geometrical distortion
(geom.R) and from the changing of the average number of
atomically bound electrons (charge R) for a 1500 atom cluster
in a 50 fs (a) and in a 10 fs (b) pulse. The insets show the
geom R and charge R separately. The dashed line shows the
integral number of photons.

At last we would like to discuss shortly the conse-
quences of our calculations on the single molecule imag-
ing suggested by R. Neutze et al.7 First, we would like
to point out that the assumption of neglecting the inter-
action of photo- and Auger electrons with the cluster is
justiﬁed only for small clusters (< 500 atoms). As it is
clear from Fig. 4(c) the authors overestimated the speed
of the Coulomb explosion. This would mean an even
higher tolerance against radiation, and a better chance
of successful imaging by a single pulse. However, it is
not enough to have the nuclei at their proper positions,
we must have electrons bound to the nuclei to scatter
x-ray photons. As we can see from Fig. 4(a), the num-
ber of stripped electrons was underestimated in Neutze’s
calculations. This error increases with cluster size. To
estimate the time available for imaging, we calculated
the deviation of temporary atomic conﬁguration from the
original one (Fig. 13). We took into account two con-
tributions: structural deviation (position changes, ∆ri)
and ionization state (how many electrons remain on the

atoms to scatter; changes in the atomic scattering fac-
tors ∆fi ). Allowing 20% overall error we can measure
up to −40 and −6 fs in the case of 50 and 10 fs pulses
respectively, to get useful structural information. Since
the pulse shape is gaussian, it is not easy to visualize the
meaning of these limits. A better characterization can
be given by the integral number of photons incident on
the sample within this period. We ﬁnd that these are
3% and 10% of the total number of photons in the case
of a 50 and a 10 fs pulse, respectively. In practice this
means that we have to disable our detector during the
major part of the pulse. A more detailed analysis on the
structural studies of small single particles by hard x-ray
free electron laser pulses will be given in a forthcoming
paper.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we gave a picture of the Coulomb explo-
sion of a small cluster of atoms initiated by a hard x-ray
pulse. In the calculations we covered a wide range of clus-
ter size from 50 to 1500 particles/cluster for short (10 fs)
and for long (50 fs) pulses. We showed that the dynamics
of the explosion is diﬀerent from that of the laser driven
Coulomb explosion. The cause of this is twofold: (i)
ionization of atoms starts from the deepest core levels in
contrast to the laser case, where it starts from the weakly
bound outer shells. (ii) the high frequency of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld in the x-ray case does not allow charged
particles to gain appreciable velocity along the ﬁeld di-
rection. These lead to the following picture: Most of the

13

electrons kicked out by the primary photoeﬀect have high
enough kinetic energy to leave the close environment of
the cluster well within the time width of the x-ray pulse.
This results in a positively charged cluster. However, this
primary ionization is enhanced by the Auger process and
by the inelastic electron-atom and electron-ion collisions.
Electrons produced this way do not have enough energy
to leave the cluster immediately, a peculiar charge distri-
bution is created from highly charged ions and electrons.
This distribution is inhomogeneous; a closely neutral core
is surrounded by a positive shell. At the end of the pulse
three typical energy distributions can be distinguished:
electrons in the inner almost neutral core condense at low
energies, most of the ions in this inner part have also low
energies, the remaining ions are in the positively charged
shell having a closely constant energy distribution at the
high energy side.

Beside the characterization of the Coulomb explosion,
we also gave an estimate for the useful time for structural
imaging of small clusters. We found that about the 3%
and 10% of the total number of photons in a pulse can
be eﬃciently used for structural imaging from a 50 and
10 fs pulse, respectively.

32 The number of the localized electrons was determined by
going backwards in the calculations (so starting from the
end), and counting those electrons, which stayed longer
than 1,2,. . . etc fs in the vicinity of the same atom. Note
that this way we can speak about localization only within
the time frame of our calculation, we call this temporary
localization.

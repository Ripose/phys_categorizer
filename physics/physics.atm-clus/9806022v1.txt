We present ground-state conﬁgurations and photoabsorp-
tion spectra of Na-7+, Na-27+ and Na-41+. For the ﬁrst
time, both the ionic structure and the photoabsorption spec-
tra of medium-size sodium clusters beyond Na-20 have been
calculated self-consistently with a non-spherical treatment of
the valence electrons in density functional theory. We use a
local pseudopotential that has been adjusted to experimental
bulk properties and the atomic 3s level of sodium. Our studies
have shown that both the ionic structure of the ground state
and the positions of the plasmon resonances depend sensi-
tively on the pseudopotential used in the calculation, which
stresses the importance of its consistent use in both steps.

Important progress has recently been made in the
measurement of photoabsorption spectra in small and
medium-size sodium clusters [1–3]. This calls for a criti-
cal re-evaluation of the theoretical description of the op-
tical response of these systems. The earliest theoreti-
cal investigations of alkali clusters employed the jellium
model [4,5] and were followed by other groups [6–9] (for a
review, see [10]). The jellium model can qualitatively ex-
plain many of the experimentally observed features [10].
But a more realistic description of metal clusters is highly
desirable, e.g.
since the unrealistic sharp jellium edge
gives rise to fundamental questions in the context of cal-
culating optical properties of metal clusters [9,10].

The all-electron ab initio methods of quantum chem-
istry treat the ionic degrees of freedom on the most so-
phisticated level presently possible [11,12]. But their
computation times grow so rapidly with the seize that
only small systems could be studied so far. Treating
only the valence electrons explicitly and describing nu-
cleus plus core electrons by a pseudopotential leads to
a considerable simpliﬁcation of the electronic system.
The unrestricted three-dimensional search for cluster
ground-state conﬁgurations using Car-Parrinello [13,14]
or Monte-Carlo methods with non-local pseudopotentials
[15] is, however, still a task of considerable complexity.

Several approximate methods have been developed for
the study of the ionic structure in larger clusters. The
“spherically averaged pseudopotential scheme” (SAPS)
[16,17] optimizes the ionic positions in three dimensions
while restricting the density of the valence electrons to
spherical symmetry; the ion-valence electron interaction
is described by the simplest pseudopotential possible, the
Ashcroft empty-core potential. However, where more ac-
curate methods can be applied, these predict ground-

state geometries which diﬀer considerably from the SAPS
results. The pseudopotential perturbation theory and
similar approaches greatly improve on the SAPS deﬁcien-
cies in the treatment of the valence electrons, but they
either consider only the volume-averaged eﬀects of ionic
structures [18,19], or require their geometries as an in-
put [20,21]. Approaching the problem from the opposite
direction, a sophisticated extension of the H¨uckel model
[22] focuses on the prediction of ground-state conﬁgura-
tions without explicitly taking the valence electrons into
account. Its results are in good agreement with ab ini-
tio calculations. However, the parameters of this model
must be adjusted to ab initio calculations and the optical
response of the electrons cannot be calculated.

With the “cylindrically averaged pseudopotential
scheme” (CAPS) [23], a method has been developed that
for the ﬁrst time allows one to self-consistently calculate
the ground states of clusters with several tens of atoms
including ionic structure without restricting the valence
electrons to spherical symmetry. The ionic conﬁguration
is hereby optimized by the method of simulated anneal-
ing which seems to be the best method for coping with
the strong isomerism found in larger clusters. The elec-
tronic system is described in density functional theory
[24]; presently we use the local density approximation
(LDA) with the functional of Perdew and Wang [25]. By
an interlaced iteration, the set of equations

∂E
∂R = 0

is simultaneously solved self-consistently. Here R denotes
the set of all ionic positions, n the electronic density and
E the energy functional

The eﬃciency of the scheme results from two approx-
imations which are made in the evaluation of the above
energy functional. First, the interaction between valence
electrons and ionic cores is described by a local pseudopo-
tential:

Vei(r; R) =

Vps(|r − Ri|).

In the present work, we have developed a more physical
pseudopotential than that used in earlier applications of
CAPS [23]; it will be discussed below.

The second approximation is that while the ions are
treated three-dimensionally, the electron density is re-
stricted to cylindrical symmetry, i.e., in the solution of
the electronic problem Vps(|r − Ri|) is replaced by its
cylindrical average

This certainly is a simpliﬁcation whose detailed conse-
quences are hard to judge a priori. However, since the
photoabsorption cross sections of singly charged sodium
clusters show that the electronic density of most clusters
has an overall prolate, oblate or spherical shape [3,8,26],
this approximation does not seem unreasonable for such
systems. A severe test for the quality of this approxima-
tion will be a comparison of its results to those of fully
three dimensional methods.

Before we present the results of our calculations,
we discuss the local pseudopotential in some more de-
tail. The most rigorous pseudopotentials in the sense of
Philipps and Kleinman [27] and modern ab initio pseu-
dopotentials [28] are always non-local in the sense that
each angular momentum component of the valence elec-
tron feels a diﬀerent potential. However, the use of non-
local pseudopotentials in the search for cluster conﬁgura-
tions quickly exhausts computational resources because
of the multiple projections which have to be done at ev-
ery step of the calculation, separately for each ion in the
absence of any symmetry. Also, it has been shown that
some ab initio pseudopotentials do not necessarily lead
to a good agreement with experiment [29]. It therefore
makes sense to address the pseudopotential question from
a more pragmatic point of view.

Already early in the development of pseudopotential
theory, it has been noted that by relaxing the Phillips-
Kleinman condition, one can open up a new class of
pseudopotentials [30]. They are called phenomenological
pseudopotentials or model potentials since they are con-
structed by choosing some analytical function as a model
potential and adjusting its parameters to experimentally
known quantities, e.g., an atomic energy level or some
bulk properties. Such model potentials can be non-local,
or several partial-wave components may be chosen to be
the same [30]. For metals with a simple electronic struc-
ture like that of sodium, one can in this way construct
pseudopotentials which are eﬀectively local. Various lo-
cal pseudopotentials have, in fact, been successfully used
(see, e.g., Refs. [20,31,32]). But the question how a valid
local pseudopotential should be constructed is nontrivial.
In Ref. [32] this question was addressed in detail with an
emphasis on solid-state properties. There, an “evanes-
cent core potential” was proposed, and we have used it in
some test cases. Most of our calculations, however, were
done with a pseudopotential that we have constructed es-
pecially for the use in ﬁnite sodium clusters, as explained
below.

Whereas in solid-state physics an important criterion
for the practical usefulness of a pseudopotential is its

fast convergence in reciprocal space, our aim is its eﬃ-
cient handling in real space. We take up experience from
CAPS [23] and parameterize the pseudopotential on the
basis of pseudodensities, related to (2) via Poisson’s equa-
tion, which can be angle averaged analytically. This al-
lows for a more eﬃcient solution of the Coulomb problem.
Moreover, the short range of the pseudodensities ensures
a fast repositioning of the ions. Our pseudopotential has
the parameterization

Vps(r) = e2 

This corresponds to a pseudodensity with a two-step pro-
ﬁle. Four of the seven parameters are ﬁxed by requiring
continuity of Vps(r) and its derivative. The remaining
parameters ̺1, r1 and r2 determine the physical prop-
erties of the pseudopotential. Clusters contain from a
few up to several thousand atoms, thus spanning the re-
gion from the atom to the bulk material. Our aim is
therefore to develop a local pseudopotential which inter-
polates between atomic and bulk properties. Thus we
choose the parameters such that two quantities are re-
produced correctly: the atomic 3s energy level ea on one
hand, and the bulk Wigner-Seitz radius rs on the other
hand. The latter is determined by the minimum of the
bulk energy per electron eb in second order perturbation
theory [32]. Using rs = 3.93a0 and the experimental
−3 and
value ea = −0.38 Ry [30] ﬁxes ̺1 = −0.503a0
r2 = 3.292a0 and gives a constraint on r1. The remain-
ing freedom in choosing r1 was exploited to ﬁt the bulk
compressibility B as closely as possible to its experimen-
tal value Bexp = 0.073 Mbar [35], yielding B = 0.0739
Mbar for r1 = 0.641a0. With these parameters we obtain
eb = −6.20 eV, close to the experimental value −6.25 eV.
The interstitial density, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between
the number of valence electrons in the Wigner-Seitz cell
and in the muﬃn-tin sphere [32], takes the value 0.35
with our pseudopotential. This agrees within three per-
cent with the value given in Ref. [32]. The band-structure
energy is 0.15 eV, in agreement with Ref. [32].

As a test-case study, we have calculated the ground
state of Na-7+ with our pseudopotential, with the
evanescent-core potential [32], and with the empty-core
like pseudopotential [23]. The D5h-geometry of Na7+ is
well known from ab initio calculations [12,15], and we
ﬁnd the pentagonal bipyramid, shown in Fig. 1, with all
three pseudopotentials. This demonstrates that CAPS
can give realistic results even for very small systems, and
that the cylindrical averaging is not too restrictive. The
inﬂuence of the pseudopotential can be seen in the bond-
ing lengths, e.g. the distance between the two edges of
the bipyramid: our pseudopotential and the evanescent
core potential result in a distance of 6.03a0 and 6.02a0,
respectively, whereas the empty-core like pseudopoten-
tial leads to a shorter distance of 5.64a0. All these values
lie in the range found in fully three-dimensional calcula-
tions: Ref. [15] quotes a distance of 5.5a0, Ref. [11] one of

2

6.26a0. Although these diﬀerences might appear small,
they have noticeable consequences for the photoabsorp-
tion spectrum, as shown in Fig. 1. Here we plot the
percentages of the energy-weighted dipole sum rule (m1)
obtained in the “localized” random phase approximation
(LRPA) [6,37]. For all pseudopotentials, two dominant
peaks are seen that together carry about 90 % of the to-
tal oscillator strength. Their relative heights reﬂect the
oblate deformation of the electron cloud in the D5h con-
ﬁguration. (The remaining 10 % of the dipole strength
are scattered in a region around 4.5 eV.) The experimen-
tal photoabsorption spectrum [2] of Na7+ shows these
two peaks at 2.35 eV and 3.25 eV when measured at
a temperature of 650 K; at 35 K the lower transition
splits into two close-lying peaks centered at 2.5 eV, while
the higher transition is shifted to 3.3 eV. Our results do
not reproduce the ﬁne splitting of the lower peak.
It
is known [37] that the LRPA cannot resolve splittings
which are due to interference of the plasmon resonance
with speciﬁc particle-hole excitations, but it correctly re-
produces the average peaks in the global strength distri-
bution. (The convergence of the LRPA basis is within
3% for the peak positions.) The most important obser-
vation is, however, that all the spectra are blue shifted
with respect to the experiment, and that the extent of
the blue shift depends remarkably on the pseudopotential
employed in the calculation. It ranges from 0.2 eV, found
for the present pseudopotential, to nearly 0.5 eV for the
empty-core type, with the evanescent-core results lying
in between. That the empty-core like pseudopotential is
the least accurate is not astonishing, since its parame-
ters were ﬁtted [23] to the bulk value of rs only in ﬁrst-
order perturbation theory. The discrepancy between the
evanescent-core pseudopotential and ours could be the
consequence of a better transferability of our pseudopo-
tential; it might also reﬂect the fact that the evanescent-
core pseudopotential is more diﬃcult to handle numeri-
cally in our code.

A blue shift of the dipole resonance in sodium clusters

3

with respect to its experimental position has been found
in many calculations, and there has been a long-standing
discussion about its origin [9,10,20,21,33,34]. Our results
show that the detailed form of the pseudopotential does
strongly inﬂuence the resonance position, but that other
eﬀects must also contribute to the discrepancy with ex-
periment. We think that one important eﬀect is the ﬁnite
temperature, present in most experiments, which results
in an increased cluster volume, and thus to a decrease of
the plasma frequency of a few percent. The experiments
of Ref. [2] show, indeed, that the average resonance posi-
tions are shifted to lower energies when the temperature
is increased. This must be borne in mind when compar-
ing the results of calculations performed at T=0 to those
experimental data of larger clusters, where the photoab-
sorption was measured only at ﬁnite temperature. On
the other hand, the LDA leads to well known errors [24]
that also aﬀect the optic response [38].

Encouraged by the correct prediction of the structure
of Na-7+, we have employed our scheme to calculate
ground-state structures and photoabsorption spectra of
sodium clusters in a size region where no self-consistent
calculations with ionic structure have been made so far.
In Figures 2 and 3, we present the ionic geometries and
photoabsorption spectra of Na-27+ and Na-41+. In both
cases, we ﬁnd good agreement with the experimental re-
sults. The overall blue shift of the resonance peaks of 7 -
9 % can again be accounted for by the eﬀects mentioned
above. The two pronounced peaks observed in Na-27+
are a consequence of an overall prolate arrangement of
the ions. Together they exhaust ∼ 80% of the total os-
cillator strength. The remaining strength is distributed
around 4.3 eV, a region which was not scanned experi-
mentally and thus omitted from the plot.

In contrast, Na-41+ has a “magic” conﬁguration of 40
valence electrons, leading to a nearly spherical density
and almost no splitting of the dipole resonance. The two
strongest close-lying transitions exhaust 64% of the total
oscillator strength.
It is very interesting to note that,
besides 20% of the strength lying outside the region of
the experiment, another 16% of the strength are scat-
tered around 3.4 eV. In the LRPA, these subpeaks are
interpreted as internal compressional modes and modes
of higher multipolarity which are coupled to the dipole
oscillation by the ionic structure. Their contributions are
seen to be in good qualitative agreement with the high-
energy shoulder observed in the experiment.

In summary, our studies have shown that CAPS, com-
bined with the localized random phase approximation,
provide a powerful tool for calculating ionic geometries
and photoabsorption spectra of medium-sized sodium
clusters where ab initio procedures are computationally
not possible with a full search of ionic structures. With
a local pseudopotential ﬁtted to bulk and atomic prop-
erties, we reproduce the global features of the dipole res-
onances, apart from a slight blue shift that leaves room
for temperature and non-LDA eﬀects. We believe that
CAPS gains additional importance since its results can

serve as an input to three-dimensional calculations, thus
bringing closer an explanation of the recent observation
of the melting of clusters which depends on a detailed
knowledge of their ionic structure [39].

The lowest energy conﬁgurations of close-packed clusters up to N = 110 atoms with stacking
faults are studied using the Monte Carlo method with a Metropolis algorithm. Two types of contact
interactions, a pair-potential and a many-atom interaction, are used. Enhanced stability is shown
for N = 12, 26, 38, 50, 59, 61, 68, 75, 79, 86, 100 and 102, of which only the sizes 38, 75, 79,
86, and 102 are pure FCC clusters, the others having stacking faults. A connection between the
model potential and density functional calculations is studied in the case of Al100. The density
functional calculations are consistent with the experimental fact that there exist epitaxially grown
FCC clusters starting from relatively small cluster sizes. Calculations also show that several other
close-packed motifs exist with comparable total energies.

INTRODUCTION

Formation of atomic clusters can lead to close-packed
(CP) structures under some conditions. The shape of
such clusters is determined by the balance of surface area,
surface energy, and internal strain. In small metal clus-
ters also the self-deformation of the valence electron den-
sity can play an important role. Other common packing
patterns in clusters include often icosahedral and decahe-
dral motifs with internal twin boundaries.[1] Metals such
as Na, Mg and Cu show icosahedral magic numbers.[1, 2]
The motivation to study FCC and other close-packed
clusters is the fact that some elements, for example Al,
are found to form FCC clusters of octahedral shape.[3]
Moreover, at certain cluster sizes pair potentials (e.g.
Lennard-Jones) also yield FCC-based structures as the
most stable isomers.

Generally, the search for the lowest energy isomer of a
cluster is a diﬃcult problem due to the vast number of
isomers which correspond to local minima on a complex
potential energy surface. The energy diﬀerences between
the isomers are caused by the surface energy,[4] strain en-
ergy due to structural defects such as twin boundaries,[5]
and in metals also the electronic shell structure.[6] For ex-
ample, if one uses classical or ab initio molecular dynam-
ics (MD) one usually needs an appropriate initial conﬁgu-
ration in order to save computation time. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
One purpose of this work is to apply the Monte Carlo
method to look for the most stable isomers of hard sphere
clusters, to be used as starting geometries for MD simu-
lations.

Classical molecular dynamics have been extensively
used to study the lowest energy structures of small clus-
ters. However, ﬁnding the correct ground state geome-
try of a small cluster (N
100) is a diﬃcult optimiza-
tion task even with classical pair potentials.[12] For his-
torical reasons, the Lennard-Jones potential is the best
studied,[13, 14, 15, 16] but other pair potentials[17, 18,
19] as well as many-atom potentials[20, 21, 22, 23] have
been used. Nearly all give an icosahedral geometry for

≤

the 13 and 55 atom clusters. The behavior of the bind-
ing energy as a function of cluster size is, however, quite
diﬀerent for diﬀerent potentials. While N = 13 is seen as
an exceptionally stable size, the second complete icosa-
hedron (N = 55) is not a clear local minimum for most
of the potentials studied. For example, the 38 atom FCC
structure (Wulﬀ’s polyhedron) depends less on the model
potential than does the 55 icosahedron.

≤

In this article, we present results for the lowest en-
ergy isomers of close-packed clusters in the size range
110. Our model, which uses the hard sphere pack-
N
ing as a starting point, does not include icosahedral and
decahedral motifs as well as any other structures with
varying bond lengths and angles. This makes our ap-
proach extremely eﬃcient in ﬁnding lowest energy struc-
tures of CP clusters. The cluster energy is determined
using either a pairwise nearest neighbor interaction or a
many-atom potential based on the tight-binding model.
For many sizes, the lowest energy structure found in-
cludes stacking faults, making the cluster a mixture of
FCC and HCP phases.

For a cluster with 100 aluminum atoms we use a den-
sity functional (DF) method to relax the atomic posi-
tions of the low energy isomers obtained with the sim-
ple model. Our goal is to study the applicability of our
classical energy expression in a realistic cluster, where
the true electronic structure is present. The cluster size
N = 100 is particularly interesting because the experi-
mental photoelectron spectrum of the anion has a large
energy gap between the highest and lower-lying occupied
orbitals.[24] Our calculations show that many of the low
energy isomers have such an energy gap, but the abso-
lute value of the theoretical gap is still smaller than the
experimental result.

The plan of this article is the following.

In Section
2, the theoretical hard sphere model and the DF method
used are outlined. The results for the lowest energy struc-
tures of the close-packed clusters and their relations to
the cluster shapes are presented in Section 3, and the DF
calculations for Al100 and the corresponding photoelec-

tron spectra are presented in Section 4. The conclusions
are given in Section 5.

II. SIMULATION METHODS

A. Monte Carlo method for hard sphere clusters

The lowest energy geometries of hard sphere clusters
are computed using the Monte Carlo (MC) method with
a Metropolis algorithm. This is described in our earlier
work where the role of stacking faults in small hard sphere
clusters was studied.[25] Similar algorithm was earlier
used by Akola et al. for making pure FCC clusters.[26]
A dense lattice is generated inside a spherical volume
in such a way that atoms occupying these lattice sites
can form an FCC or HCP lattice or any combination of
these two, including stacking faults in all possible direc-
tions. The lattice sites are then randomly populated with
N atoms, such that the minimum distance between any
atom pair is twice the hard sphere radius, i.e., the nearest
neighbor distance in the FCC lattice. After this, a Monte
Carlo procedure is used together with the cluster binding
energy to change the lattice site occupations leading to
a “clustering” of atoms. The simulation is started at a
high temperature that is gradually decreased to zero to
obtain the low energy isomers. This optimization proce-
dure, including millions of steps, is repeated typically at
least 1000 times for each cluster size. During the opti-
mization, we record not only the most stable geometry
but also many other low energy isomers.

Two simple models, a pair-potential (PP) and a tight-
binding based potential (TB), are used as a contact in-
teraction between the hard spheres.
In the former the
energy is calculated as

EPP =

V

Ci =

(1)

where Ci is the coordination number of the atom i and
V is the strength of the interaction (V determines the
energy scale) and Nbonds is the total number of bonds
(contacts between the hard spheres). The second model
is derived from tight-binding theory,[27, 28] and it has a
simple square root dependence on the coordination num-
ber

ETB =

V

pCi.

(2)

In practice, Eq.(2) has shown to be a good approximation
for the true TB energy of small clusters.[29] Nevertheless,
this model cannot describe eﬀects related to the details
of the electronic structure, such as Jahn-Teller deforma-
tion, and the geometries obtained from Eq.(2) should not
be confused with the most stable geometries determined
with the true tight-binding method.[30, 31]

2

The Monte Carlo simulations are performed using the
PP model energy expression Eq.(1), which leads in many
cases to several diﬀerent geometries with the same en-
ergy. The TB interaction is more practicable here, since
it is more sensitive in separating the energy of diﬀerent
isomers.
In most cases, it removes the degeneracy of
lowest energy isomers of the PP model. The TB model
favors geometries where each atom has a similar coordi-
nation, whereas the PP model is insensitive to the bond
distribution.

B. Electronic structure calculations

The DF calculations of Al100 isomers are performed
using the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD)
code,[32] where the electron-ion interaction is described
by an ionic pseudopotential, [33] and the generalized gra-
dient correction approximation of Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof (PBE) is applied to the exchange correlation
energy of the electron density.[34] The basis set is taken
to be plane waves with a cut-oﬀ energy of 15.4 Ry. In
contrast to many Car-Parrinello simulations, we do not
enforce periodicity in the system, i.e., calculations are
performed in an isolated cubic box of 25.4 ˚A. We also do
not employ the Car-Parrinello algorithm for the coupling
of ionic and electronic solutions during geometry opti-
mization, and the electronic Hamiltonian is rediagonal-
ized after each geometry optimization step. The metal
clusters studied show systematically small energy gaps
between the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals
(HOMO-LUMO gaps).
In order to converge the elec-
tron density, a ﬁnite temperature functional (T = 300
K) is used for the the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital occupan-
cies. The ionic positions are optimized according to a
conjugate gradient method until all the nuclear gradient
components are below 1

10−4 au.

III. RESULTS

A. Lowest energy geometries of the hard sphere
clusters

Tables I, II, III, and IV give the energies of the low-
est energy isomers found with the PP and TB potentials.
For each size, we show the energy of the most stable FCC
isomer together with the lowest energy isomer with one
or more stacking faults (SF). In addition, the occupa-
tion numbers of parallel (111) layers in the FCC isomer
are also shown (this is not done for the SF clusters, since
these cannot generally be described by parallel (111) lay-
ers). Examples of the isomers obtained are shown in Fig-
ures 1, 2, and 3. The results for the most stable isomers
58 agree with those published
of small clusters N = 4
earlier, [25] except for some TB energies. The lowest en-
ergy structures obtained using the PP model are similar
to the results by Doye and Wales [35] except for N = 33,

a more stable geometry (for 33, 49, 51, 69, 82, 107 our re-
sults have one additional bond, for 50, 68, 108 two bonds
more than those of Doye and Wales).

The total number of bonds in the most stable geometry
is the same in both the PP and TB models for all N . The
diﬀerence between the two energy formulas appears only
in separation between diﬀerent isomers with the same
number of bonds. For each cluster size we have deter-
mined the lowest energy FCC geometry, but the most
stable geometry with at least one stacking fault is deter-
mined only for those clusters where a stacking fault does
not decrease the number of bonds (as in the sizes 4, 38,
39, 40, 86, 88, 102, 104). For the other sizes (see Tables I-
IV), the TB model gives lower energies for SF structures
in many cases. A detailed discussion of the structure
evolution of small hard sphere clusters has been given
earlier,[25] and we concentrate on clusters with more than
60 atoms in the following.

forming an HCP-lattice and the ﬁfth in a stacking fault
position (layer-packing ABABC, which can be seen as
two connected FCC subunits). SF clusters with N = 68,
69, and 73 have similar structures, whereas the cluster
sizes 70, 72 and 74 atoms show four parallel FCC layers,
and the ﬁfth layer is displaced in a stacking fault posi-
tion. The lowest energy structure of 71 atoms consists of
two FCC subdomains (layer-packing ABCBA).

In the size range 75–80, the lowest energy isomers are
FCC structures according to the TB potential with a very
small energy diﬀerence to SF structures. This applies
also for N = 79, where the FCC construction gives a
complete truncated octahedron (TO). The corresponding
SF isomer (two FCC units connected) also has large (111)
facets, which explains the low energy. Similar kinds of
SF clusters with a stacking fault layer inside the cluster
92, and 94, while N = 81, 83,
are found in N = 81
and 92 are better than FCC for both potentials. The
clusters with 86 and 88 atoms have a nondegenerate FCC
energy minimum in the PP model. These isomers are
based on the FCC-79 with one (111) overlayer. For N =
87, the FCC structure is still lower in TB energy, but
there are SF structures with the same number of bonds
(PP energy). The lowest energy isomers of N = 93 and
95 consist of four FCC layers, with the ﬁfth being in
HCP position (with respect to the two lower layers). The
clusters with N = 96
98 atoms do not have stacking
faults according to the TB model.

The most stable isomers for 99 or 100 atoms have an

SFS structure based on a truncated FCC tetrahedron
with stacking faults at each of the four surfaces. The
100 atom cluster has the same structural motif as SFS-
59, whereas in the case of 99 (101) atoms, one surface
atom is removed (added). The lowest-lying TB geome-
tries for 101
104, N = 106, 109, and 110 are
FCC structures with ﬁve (111) layers. They all are re-
lated to FCC-102, which is an elongated TO having a full
atom shell (similar to FCC-52). Clusters with N = 105,
107 and 108 prefer stacking faults in the TB model, and
SF-105 has the largest number of bonds in its class.

B. Magic numbers

The most stable cluster sizes (magic numbers) reﬂect
the stability of the cluster with respect to the neighbor-
ing sizes.
In order to see also the possible regions of
increased stability, it is convenient to subtract a smooth
size dependence from the energy. This can be obtained
by ﬁtting the total energies to a “mass formula” Eave =
EcohN + bN 2/3 + cN 1/3, where b and c are ﬁtting pa-
−
rameters and Ecoh is the cohesion energy of the model
V √3
in question (Ecoh =
for the TB model).[37, 38] Figure 4 shows the deviation
of energy from this function. Clusters with N = 12, 26,
38, 50, 59, 61, 68, 75, 79, 86, 100, and 102 are the most
pronounced local minima, but there are several weaker lo-
cal minima, and the results show odd-even alternation in
some regions. However, since this behavior is not of elec-
tronic origin,[36] the minima can be for N even (around
38) or odd (around 61).

The general proﬁle of the energy curve is related to
the total number of bonds. This is natural in our model
which totally neglects the internal strain.
In all cases,
the lowest PP and TB structures have the same number
of bonds and qualitatively similar energy curves. Note
that from the magic sizes only those with 38, 75, 79, 86,
and 102 atoms are pure FCC clusters, while others have
stacking faults. Doye and Wales have used a pair-wise
Morse potential in the size range 20
80 to study
the eﬀect of potential range on the magic numbers.[39]
For the hardest potential studied, they found magic num-
bers 26, 38, 50, 55, 59, 61, 68, and 79, which are present
in our results except the size 55, which is an icosahedron.
These results seem to indicate that the internal strain is
not important in clusters which do not have twin bound-
aries.

where Ri is the atom position and Rcm the center of mass
(in units of the FCC lattice constant). The factor 1/N 5/3
is chosen because the moment of inertia is proportional
to N 5/3 for a spherical cluster. The normalized moments
of inertia are shown in Figure 5(a), and the similarity
between Figures 4 and 5(a) is obvious. The minima in
moments of inertia are present also in the energy curve
except for N = 15, 19, and 107.

It is also interesting to resolve the cluster deformation
on the basis of moments of inertia, since for a sphere (or
a cube, etc.) all the principal components of inertia are
equal. Figure 5(b) shows the diﬀerence of the maximum
and minimum components as a function of cluster size.
Many of the magic clusters (N = 38, 59, 68, 79, 100) have
high symmetry, but some, e.g. 50, 86, and 102 have a
marked deformation. The large (111) facets compensate
the increase in surface area (deformation) in such cases.

D. Electronic structure calculations of Al100
isomers

In order to test the applicability of our classical en-
ergy expressions for Al clusters we have chosen an MC-
generated test set of 15 low energy isomers for N = 100
together with the corresponding icosahedral and decahe-
dral isomers, which we optimized using the DF method.
The results for total energies, bond lengths, deformation,
and HOMO-LUMO gaps (Eg) of KS orbitals are pre-
sented in Table V. The corresponding cluster geometries
are shown in Figure 6. The FCC isomers are all based on
the same structural motif, which leads to a full atomic
shell of an elongated TO at cluster size 102 (notice the
two missing atoms in Figure 6). The higher degree of free-
dom in the case of clusters with stacking faults results in
a variety of diﬀerent structures. Among the 11 diﬀerent
geometries chosen from this class, ﬁve of them (SF2, SF3,
SF6, SF7, and SF8) have the same structure of two con-
nected FCC subdomains with two external atoms chang-
ing their positions on the surface, and we show the most
stable geometry SF2. As representatives of CP clusters,
the SFS isomers T1 and T2 have stacking faults in all

four [111] directions. The perfect symmetry of T1 is bro-
ken in T2 (not shown) via a surface atom displacement.
The icosahedral and decahedral isomer structures are ob-
tained from the Cambridge Cluster Database,[40] where
ICO corresponds to the most stable icosahedral conﬁgu-
ration found with a model potential, and DECA is based
on the Mark’s decahedron for 101 atoms (one atom is
removed).

≥

The isomers in Table V are ordered according to the
DF total energy. The FCC isomers have lowest energy,
followed by other CP structures, and the DECA and ICO
isomers are signiﬁcantly higher due to the internal strain
within these geometries. This is in agreement with a
previous study of Al clusters, [26] which showed that Al
tends to form FCC geometries at a relatively early stage
(N
55). In contrast to the classical potentials, DF cal-
culations give a higher total energy for T1 than for the
other CP clusters (except for T2). The highly symmetric
geometry of T1 results in degeneracies of electronic levels
(see Figure 7), and one of them occurs at the Fermi en-
ergy, leading to an energetically unstable situation. The
cluster undergoes a small Jahn-Teller deformation, which
can be seen as a ﬁnite HOMO-LUMO gap in Table V,
but there are no changes in the overall shape. We pre-
sume that a deformation of the T1 shape should lower the
total energy, especially when the other structures show
marked deformations (see Table V). This is related to
the self-deformation of valence electron density in the
jellium model,[41] a phenomenon that lowers total en-
ergy. Taking this eﬀect into account, we have modiﬁed
our expression for the classical energy:

calibrated using the DF results for FCC1 and T1 (diﬀer-
ence in binding energy), assuming that FCC1 represents
an ideal deformation. The results for the new classical
energy in Table V now correlate better with DF calcula-
tions, but SF2 and structures related to it remain close
to the lowest energy isomer, indicating that other contri-
butions (such as surface and strain energy) must also be
considered.

Density functional calculations show that the CP iso-
mers lie within a very narrow energy range of 1.13 eV
(Table V), corresponding to 90 K when converted to vi-
brational energy.[42] Moreover, the energy diﬀerence be-
tween the most stable (FCC1) and next higher (SF1)
isomers is negligible, which emphasizes that one cannot
claim that FCC clusters are more stable than SF struc-
tures. The nearest neighbor distances reveal, however,
some minor deviations: in FCC clusters the average bond
length is slightly smaller, and the related distribution
width is narrow. The FCC isomers are evidently rela-
tively strain-free, which partially explains the energetic
trend in the CP data set (see also ICO and DECA). As
discussed above, the electronic structure contributes to
the total energy, as shown by the HOMO-LUMO gap,
which is maximized via a self-deformation process when-
ever possible. It is shown in Table V that the HOMO-
LUMO gaps of Al100 clusters are in the range of 0.02-0.21
eV, and that the most stable structures FCC1 and SF1
also have signiﬁcant values. Nevertheless, there is no
clear trend among the clusters studied.

The electronic density of states (DOS) of FCC1 and T1
clusters is shown in Figure 7. The DOS of T1 is highly
peaked due to the electron level degeneracies whereas
FCC1 shows a gradually increasing DOS with less ﬁne
structure. The latter applies basically to all the other CP

isomers that have no symmetry in the cluster geometry.
In order to compare our results with the spherical jellium
model (SJM), we have labeled the main peaks present in
the T1 spectrum according to the related number of va-
lence electrons (KS orbitals). Apart from Nel = 56, the
system corresponds fully with the magic numbers of SJM
up to 198 valence electrons, after which the exact details
in the cluster shape and structure start to contribute.
The T1 cluster actually has a Td symmetry, but a corner
truncation has brought it apart from a perfect tetrahe-
dron, and no magic numbers related to the tetrahedral
external potential can be observed.[43] The last electron
shell in the T1 spectrum is only partially ﬁlled, and there
is no shell closing at Nel = 300 (Fermi energy).

−

The experimental photoelectron spectrum (PES) of
AlN (N = 100
112) cluster anions [24] shows a marked
gap at the threshold region. Based on our earlier experi-
ence with Al clusters,[11, 26] we have compared the DOS
−
100 isomers (not shown) with the exper-
of close-packed Al
imental PES. As indicated by the sizable HOMO-LUMO
gaps of neutral clusters, qualitatively correct features can
be observed in the DOS of lowest energy isomers (FCC1
and SF1). However, the separation of the ﬁrst peak in the
theoretical DOS is far too small (0.2 eV), and the corre-
sponding electron detachment energy is 3.2 eV, whereas
it is 3.4 eV in the experiments. This suggests that the
experimental spectrum is dominated by an electronically
stable isomer that is not considered in the present study.
Presumably, the long thermal tail in the experimental
PES (starting from 3.1 eV) is caused by the presence of
other isomers – such as FCC1 and SF1.

IV. CONCLUSION

Close-packed geometries are important

structures
present in a small cluster size regime, and we have stud-
ied the structures of hard sphere clusters up to N = 110
atoms using two types of classical potentials. The total
energy is minimized using the Monte Carlo method. For
most sizes, the discrete PP model leads to several isomers
with the same total energy (number of bonds). Only for
N = 4, 38–40, 86, 88, 102, and 104 does the FCC geom-
etry have more bonds than any of the geometries with
stacking faults. On the other hand, for N = 5, 11, 12,
26–28, 33, 35, 49–51, 58–60, 81, 83, 92, 99–100, 105 the
most stable PP isomer does not have an FCC structure.
Clusters with N = 58
100 atoms have
a tetrahedral symmetry and stacking faults on all surface
facets. An inclusion of the TB model yields qualitatively
same results, the only eﬀect being in the separation of
the isomers having the maximal coordination.

60 and N = 99

−

−

The energy as a function of the cluster size shows that
clusters with N = 12, 26, 38, 50, 59, 61, 68, 75, 79, 86,
100, and 102 have the most pronounced energy minima.

8

Of these only the 38, 75, 79, 86, and 102 atom clusters
have an FCC structure. The moments of inertia corre-
late well with the energy curve, showing that most of the
magic clusters have also a compact geometry, i.e., the
overall shape of clusters is not deformed. There exist,
however, structures such as FCC-102 where the defor-
mation is compensated by the large (111) facets. Such a
behavior becomes increasingly important as the cluster
size increases, leading to an epitaxial growth pattern.[44]
The connection between the model potential and DF
calculations has been studied in the case of Al100. The
DF calculations show that the strain-free CP structures
are lower in total energy than the corresponding icosahe-
dral and decahedral isomers. In CP regime the total en-
ergy diﬀerences are very small (supposing that the coor-
dination number of the cluster is close to the maximum),
and the electronic structure becomes important. As il-
lustrated by the isomer T1, the valence electron density
of Al100 clusters prefers deformation, and this criterion
is fulﬁlled by almost all the CP isomers presented. None
of the structures reported reproduces the experimental
PES.[24] The exceptional shape of the experimental curve
and the high electron detachment energy indicate that
the underlying isomer must be electronically very stable.
We speculate that perhaps an elongated (or otherwise
deformed) T1 isomer, where the degeneracy at the Fermi
energy is removed, can reproduce this feature. A simple
geometry optimization is not enough to investigate this
possibility, and ab initio MD simulations will be neces-
sary.

CP clusters with stacking faults are potential candi-
dates for the most stable isomer in some occasions, and
we have demonstrated this for Al100, where the energetic
diﬀerence between the FCC and SF clusters is negligible.
Therefore, these structural motifs are competitive even
at relatively large cluster sizes (N
100). Experiments
indicate that the octahedral FCC isomers start to domi-
200 due to formation
nate the Al mass-spectrum at N
of large (111) facets that minimize the surface energy.

We report equilibrium geometric structures of CuO2, CuO3, CuO6, and CuO

clusters obtained
by an all-electron linear combination of atomic orbitals scheme within the density functional theory
with generalized gradient approximation to describe the exchange-correlation eﬀects. The vibra-
tional stability of all clusters is examined on the basis of the vibrational frequencies. A structure
with Cs symmetry is found to be the lowest energy structure for CuO2 while a Y shaped structure
clusters,
with C2v symmetry is the most stable structure for CuO3. For the larger CuO6 and CuO
several competitive structures exist with structures containing ozonide units being higher in energy
than those with O2 units. The infra-red and Raman spectra are calculated for the stable optimal
geometries.

INTRODUCTION

The copper-oxygen complexes have received signiﬁcant
attention because of their role in various processes such
as catalytic oxidation, applications in the bio-inorganic
chemistry, and corrosion to name a few. Numerous stud-
ies, both theoretical as well as experimental, have been
reported to elucidate the chemical bonding between cop-
per and oxygen in such complexes. Most of these studies
were conﬁned to small sizes of CuOx systems such as
CuO and CuO2 molecules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These earlier
studies have been recently extended to larger systems by
Wang and coworkers [1, 2] who reported photoelectron
spectra (PES) studies of CuOx (x = 1 − 6) species. They
found that the Cu/O complexes containing either an odd
or even number of oxygen atoms had similarities among
themselves with respect to their PES. They also found
several new copper-oxide molecules including CuO6 and
proposed some structures for these molecules on the ba-
sis of their PES study. Massobrio and coworkers[3, 4, 5]
subsequently performed a systematic search for the low-
est energy structure for CuO6. In their density functional
calculations with ultrasoft pseudopotentials they found
the lowest energy structure of CuO6 to possess ozonide
Cu(O3)2 units contrary to the prediction in Ref.2 of an
oxide structure Cu(O2)3 on the basis of photo-electron
spectra. They also found that the structures containing
the Cu(O2)3 units to be roughly within 0.2 eV. Cu is
known to form OCuO or Cu(O3) upon reaction with O2
only under UV radiation at low temperature [6]. The Cu
atom at room temperature can form only Cu(O2) com-
plexes with O2 because the O atom transfer reaction is
endothermic.

The present work is aimed at providing a detailed pic-
ture of the stationary points on the potential energy sur-
face of the CuO2, CuO3, CuO6 and anionic CuO6 clus-
ters. For this purpose, we perform a systematic search
for possible candidate structures for the ground state ge-
ometries of these clusters, followed by calculation of the
vibrational spectra to identify the nature of stationary
points. As the energy diﬀerences between the isomers
are small, we employ an all-electron treatment thereby
eliminating any question due to the ultrasoft pseudopo-
tential approximation. The present work complements
the previous investigation on these systems by Pouillon
and coworkers [3, 4, 5]. Additionally, we have also calcu-
lated vertical detachment energies of the CuO6 isomers
and also the infrared absorption and Raman scattering
spectra of the lowest energy CuO6 isomers. These may be
useful for comparison with experimental measurements.
In the following section the computational procedures
employed in this work are brieﬂy described followed by
the results and discussion in the subsequent section.

II. DETAILS OF COMPUTATIONAL

PROCEDURE

The calculations have been performed within the
Kohn-Sham formulation of the density functional the-
ory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
to describe the exchange-correlation eﬀects [7]. We have
used the PBE functional by Perdew and coworkers [8].
Structural optimizations of all the clusters were per-
formed by starting from a number of possible candidate
structures, including those already reported in the lit-
erature [3, 4]. The optimization was performed using
the conjugate-gradient as well as the LBFGS method.
For the case of the anionic CuO6 systems, the optimized
neutral geometries are used as the starting geometries.
All calculations have been performed using the Naval

Research Laboratory Molecular Orbital Library (NRL-
MOL) package [9]. This suite of programs employs a
Gaussian basis set where the exponentials of the Gaus-
sian basis are optimized for each atom [10]. The integra-
tions are carried out using a grid based method with a
variational mesh. Further, the magnetic moment is op-
timized during the self-consistency cycle from electron
counting considerations. The geometries were optimized
until the forces were less than 0.001 a.u.. The nature of
stationary points (optimized geometries) on the potential
energy surface was examined by computing the vibra-
tional frequencies. These were calculated by displacing
the atoms from their equilibrium positions by ±0.07 a.u.
along each Cartesian direction and constructing the dy-
namical matrix from the forces of the distorted molecules
[11]. The vibrational frequencies were subsequently ob-
tained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix. This also
allows one to compute the zero-point energies. We also
calculate the IR and Raman spectra of the optimized
CuO6 molecule which are obtained from the derivatives
of the dipole moments and polarizability tensors [27].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Our test calculations performed for O2 and O3
molecules yield the bond lengths of O2 and O3 as 1.22 and
1.28 ˚Awhich are in excellent agreement with the experi-
mental values of 1.21 and 1.28 ˚A. The bond angle for O3
is also well predicted, 118o (calc.) vs. 117o (expt. [29]).
The calculated vibrational frequencies for O2 and O3,
1547 cm−1and 708, 1061, 1185 cm−1agree well with the
experimental values [28, 29] of 1580 cm−1and 705, 1042,
1110 cm−1respectively. However, the calculated dissocia-
tion energies of O2 and O3 are 6.80 eV and 9.06 eV while
the experimental values are 5.1 and 6.2 eV. Although the
dissociation energies are grossly overestimated, there is
good agreement for structural parameters between the
calculated values and experiment.
In the following we
discuss the CuOx complexes for x=1,2,3,and 6.

A. CuO

The calculated values of bond length, dissociation en-
ergy and the vibrational frequency of the CuO molecule
are given in Table I. Earlier theoretical values calculated
at diﬀerent levels of theory along with the experimen-
tal values are also included for comparison. Our calcu-
lated value of bond length 1.72 ˚Ais in excellent agreement
with experimental value of 1.73 ˚A[25]. The PBE func-
tional seems to provide signiﬁcant improvement over the
LSDA and also seem to perform better than the B3LYP
in the bond length prediction. Our calculated value of
the vibrational frequency (680 cm−1) is again in good
agreement with experiment (631 cm−1). The dissocia-
tion energy is however overestimated in all the theoretical
calculations including the present one.

The optimized structures of various isomers of the

CuO2 molecule are shown in Fig. 1.

The bent CuOO structure (A in Fig.1) with Cs sym-
metry is the lowest energy structure amongst the Cu(O2)
complexes. It is lower than the linear OCuO molecule
(structure B) by 0.76 eV. The third structure with C2v
symmetry ( C in Fig. 1 ) in which the Cu atom occu-
pies a side on position with respect to the O2 is higher
in energy by 0.55 eV. The fourth isomer with C2v sym-
metry (isomer D in Fig. 1) is not reported in earlier

works and is found to be lower than the structure C
by 0.02 eV. In this wide-angled isomer the distance be-
tween the two oxygen atoms is much larger than that in
the third structure. The OCuO angle in C is 410 while
that in the isomer D is 1570. Our vibrational frequency
calculations have shown that the side on C isomer has
one imaginary frequency. Such imaginary frequency for
this isomer has also been observed in the earlier density
functional based work of Barone and Adamo[14]. Earlier
quantum chemical calculation by Bauschlicher[23] found
isomer C to be more stable than the bent structure A.
They however note that the two structures are energeti-
cally very close with their order being dependent on the
numerical details. More recent quantum chemical calcu-
lation (CCSD) using the eﬀective core potential (ECP)
reports the side-on structure C to be the lowest. The
diﬀerences are possibly due to the use of ECP. The bent
CuOO structure (A) found as the lowest energy struc-
ture in the present work is in agreement with the earlier
DFT calculations [5]. However, the order of isomers as
the structures A, C, and B in increasing energy ob-
served in earlier DFT works is now altered in the present
work due to the new isomer (D) found in this work. This
isomer is the next low-lying isomer to the lowest energy

structure. The calculated values of the Cu-O and O-
O bond lengths, ∠OCuO, spin magnetic moment, atom-
ization energy and vibrational frequencies are compared
with the existing theoretical and experimental results in
Table II. The earlier theoretical calculations have pre-
dicted the dissociation energy of CuO2 with respect to
Cu and O2 to lie between 0.42 -0.56 eV [14, 21, 23]. The
lowest-energy structure has a doublet state in agreement
with the experimental observation [12, 16]. Our results
show that in the linear structure B, the Cu-O distance
is 1.67 ˚Awhich is in good agreement with the prediction
based on the experimental absorption spectra[18] and is
also consistent with the ﬁndings of another experimental
result[6]. Another density functional based calculation
[15] using the Perdew-Wang91 GGA [26], however pre-
dicts the quartet state to be lower in energy by 0.1 eV.
Since the two GGA functionals, PBE in the present and
PW91 in Ref. [15], are essentially similar, the prediction
in Ref. [15] could be due to other numerical details like
choice of basis set in Ref. 15. They however conclude the
ground state to be a doublet on the basis of vibrational
frequencies. Density functional calculation by Cherithin
et al. [16] using the hybrid B3LYP GGA also predicts the
quartet to be lower than the doublet, but again assign the

doublet to be the ground state on the basis of frequency
calculations. Our predicted values of frequencies are in
good agreement with the experimental values and earlier
B3LYP calculation[16]. Unlike previous theoretical cal-
culations, the present calculation correctly points doublet
to be the ground state on the consideration of both the
dissociation energy as well as the frequencies.

The frequency labeled ω1 in Table II corresponds to a
bending mode in the bent structure or a ﬂapping mode
for the linear and the wide-angled structures. The ω2
refers to a stretching of Cu-O bonds resulting in a breath-
ing mode of vibration for the symmetric structures. The
third frequency corresponds to the O-O stretch mode in
the bent structure while in the linear and wide-angled
structures it corresponds to the vibration of the Cu atom.
The O-O stretching mode of the bent structure at 1200
cm−1shows a large peak in the infrared absorption spec-
trum while the mode at 240 cm−1is strongly Raman ac-
tive.

C. CuO3

The equilibrium structures of CuO3 are presented in
Fig. 2. The ﬁrst structure (A in Fig. 2) has a Y shape
with Cu atom occupying the center of the fork position.
The isomer B has a distorted rhombus structure while C
and D structures are chain-like. One of the chain struc-
tures has a linear O-Cu-O unit while the other one has a
wide-angled O-Cu-O unit. The spin magnetic moments,
dissociation energies and the vibrational frequencies of
the four isomers are given in Table III. Our results in-
dicate that the Y shaped cluster containing a side-on
CuO2 unit is the lowest energy structure. The spin state
of this structure is quartet. This result is in agreement
with earlier published DFT calculations [3, 13]. The dis-
torted rhombus structure has the Cu atom bonded with
an O3 unit which we refer to as copper ozonide structure.
This isomer is higher in energy by 0.54 eV. The chain-
like structures have energies lying between the Y shaped
structure and the ozonide structure.

The calculated vibrational frequencies of all the four
isomers are real indicating that all the four structures are
local minima on the potential energy surface (Cf. Table
III). In case of the lowest energy structure (Structure A),
the lowest two modes correspond to bending motions, the
ﬁrst one in plane and the second one perpendicular to the
plane of the molecule. The third mode pertains to the
rotational motion of the O2 unit about an axis perpendic-
ular to the O-O bond. The next two modes correspond to
Cu-O bond stretch modes. The largest frequency (1158
cm−1) mode refers to the O-O stretch mode. Similar to
the smaller clusters, this mode of vibration is strongly IR
active while Cu-O stretch modes show signiﬁcant Raman
scattering.

In the ozonide isomer (B), the lowest three frequencies
respectively involve the asymmetric stretch of the Cu-O
bonds, vibration of the central O perpendicular to the

plane of the molecule and a symmetric stretch of the Cu-
O bond leading to a breathing mode. The frequencies
from 687 to 987 cm−1pertain to the ﬂapping , asymmet-
ric O-O stretch and a symmetric O-O stretch modes of
the ozone unit. However, the frequencies are lower than
a free ozone unit indicating weaker O-O bonds in the
O3 unit due to the presence of the Cu atom. The mode
at 807 cm−1shows strong infrared absorption while those
around 200 cm−1are highly Raman active. Cherithin et
[16] have observed peaks around 800 cm−1(812, 802
al.
and 792 cm−1) in their IR measurement which they have
attributed to the Cu-ozonide structure. The present re-
sults are supportive of this assignment.

In the two chain-like structures the vibrational fre-
quencies are comparable and the modes are same. The
lowest two modes correspond to the vibration of the Cu
atom in and out of the plane of the molecule. The next
two frequencies refer to the asymmetric Cu-O stretch
modes while the largest frequency corresponds to the O-
O stretch mode which is also strongly IR active. The vi-
brational frequency of the O-O unit in the linear modes
tends towards that of the free O2 frequency (1547 cm−1).
The Cu-O stretch modes display Raman activity. The
dissociation energies of the chain-like molecules C and D
into CuO and O2 are 1.14 and 0.76 eV.

D. CuO6

In the CuO3 clusters, we have seen that the ozonide
cluster is higher in energy than the Y shaped structure
which contains an O2 unit. On the other hand, the CuO2
triangular structure is higher in energy than a linear Cu-
O-O structure.
It would be interesting to see how the
cluster structure changes in the presence of more oxygens.
The knowledge of structures for the smaller sizes is

useful in building up the starting geometries for the op-
timization of CuO6. We have started with several possi-
ble structures as input for optimization. The optimized
geometries are presented in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst two struc-
tures, labeled as A and B in the Fig.3, contain the three
O2 units and also a CuO2 triangle. The diﬀerence in
the structures lie in the orientations of the open-ended
O2 units. The isomers C and D contain closed Cu-O3
rings. The isomer C is planar and the isomer D is 3-
dimensional. The structure E has both O3 and O2 units
of which the O3 forms a closed ring with the Cu atom.
For the next isomer (F ) also, both O3 and O2 units
are present and the Cu atom forms end-on bonds with
these units. The last structure G has three O2 units
all of which form end-on bonds with the Cu atom. This
structure was arrived at by starting the geometry op-
timization with the structure predicted by Wang et al.
based on their photoelectron spectra. Our calculations
have shown the structure labeled as A has the lowest
energy among all the structures shown here. The struc-
tures B and G are comparable in energy and both are
higher relative to structure A by 0.12 and 0.22 eV re-
spectively. The isomers C and D with ozonide subunits
are higher than A by 0.95 and 0.94 eV respectively. The
ozonide planar structure C was reported to be the lowest
energy structure by Pouillon and Massobrio [3]. This dif-
ference in the present and their calculations for the lowest
energy structure is probably due to their choice of ultra-
soft pseudopotential for representation of core electrons
and brings out the importance of treating all electrons at
equal footing in the CuOx system. The structures E and
F are higher in energy by 1.62 and 1.79 eV, respectively.
The atomization energies of these isomers are presented
in Table IV. The atomization energy includes the zero-
point energy of the systems.

The vibrational frequencies of the isomers are pre-
sented in Table IV. Both the structures A and B are
In these two lowest
found to be vibrationally stable.
energy structures A and B , the modes of vibrations
are pretty similar. The low frequency modes are asso-
ciated with the bending and ﬂapping of the open-ended
O2 units. On the other hand the high frequency modes
are associated with the stretching of the O-O bonds re-
ﬂecting the strength of these bonds. The Cu-O bond
stretch modes have frequencies lying between 250 to 525
cm−1. The lower frequencies mainly correspond to the
bond bending motions of the O2 units.
In the struc-
ture A the high frequency modes corresponding to the
O-O bond stretching show signiﬁcant IR absorption while
the modes below 400 cm−1show Raman activity. On the
other hand, the structure B is IR inactive and has modes
below 200 cm−1that are Raman active.

The structure C comprising an ozonide unit is also vi-
brationally stable. This structure is both Raman and IR
active. The Raman scattering is seen in the low frequency
range of 300-350 cm−1, where the modes correspond to
bending of the molecule and also symmetric and asym-
metric stretching of the four Cu-O bonds. The IR active

modes are the high frequency modes in the range of 800
- 920 cm−1. These are again O-O stretch modes which
are asymmetric. The largest mode is also a symmetric
O-O stretch mode leading to a breathing mode. How-
ever, unlike the other structure where the largest mode
is strongly IR active, this mode is IR inactive. This is
due to the fact that this mode is symmetric and does not
lead to a change in dipole moment of the molecule.

The structure D with two orthogonal planar O3 units,
is a saddle point with an imaginary vibrational frequency.
The eigenvector of the mode shows it related to a bending
motion which try to break the orthogonality of the two
ozone units. This orthogonality was not enforced during
the optimization. Both the structures E and F contain-
ing both O2 and O3 units are found to be vibrationally
stable. However, they are very high on the energy scale.
This is again consistent with the energy ordering seen in
the CuO3 isomers in which both the ring-like and linear
structures are higher in energy than the Y shaped one.
The vibrational analysis of the structure G showed it to
be a saddle point on the potential energy surface. The G
isomer containing three open-ended O2 units shows IR
activity in the range of 1200-1250 cm−1. These again are
O-O stretching modes. However the largest frequency
mode which corresponds to symmetric stretching of all
the O-O bonds is found to be IR inactive. This can be
attributed to the fact that this mode retains the overall
symmetry of the molecule and does not lead to a change
of the dipole moment.

We have also considered various possible anionic struc-
tures of the CuO6 molecule. The optimized structures of
the anion are very similar to their neutral counterparts
and are therefore not shown. These structures are ob-
tained by starting the optimization with the geometries
of neutral clusters. As in the neutral case, the struc-
ture A is found to be the lowest-energy structure. The
relative energies, vibrational frequencies, vertical detach-
ment energies of these structures are given in Table V.
An analysis of the vibrational frequencies show that the
structures A, B, C and D pertain to local minima on
the potential energy surface. The structure E is the only
structure to become somewhat modiﬁed from its neutral
geometry in that the oxygen dimer tilts away from the
Cu and Cu-O2 bond length increases to 2.3 ˚A. Also the
CuO3 closed ring structure becomes opened at one end.
This structure is vibrationally stable but energetically
high. On the other hand, the high energy structure G
has two imaginary frequencies associated with it. The op-
timization of the anionic counterpart of structure F was
abandoned due to failure to obtain a convergent solution.
The structure D in neutral form is vibrationally unstable
but the anionic form is vibrationally stable. The adi-
abatic electron aﬃnity of the lowest energy structure is
found to be 2.75 eV in which the zero point motion of the
molecule is also taken into consideration. The calculated
values of the VDE (Cf. Table V) are in the range 2.8−3.5
eV. The experimental value of the electron binding en-
ergy in CuO6 as measured from photoelectron spectra is
3.2 eV [2]. The structures with ozonide units as well as
with O2 units, both have the VDE around this value and
based on the consideration of the VDE alone, it is diﬃ-
cult to infer about the correct anion geometry. However,
the VDE combined with total energy values indicate the
oxide structure to be the candidate for the ground state
geometry for the neutral CuO6.

The analysis of nature of bonding based on the charge
density diﬀerences shows the expected behavior, that the
O-O bonding is covalent while Cu-O bonds are more ionic
in nature. The plot of isosurface of charge density are
shown in Fig. 4 for the case CuO6. The lowest energy
CuO6 is stable by 2.72 eV against dissociation into Cu
atom and three O2 molecules. This translates to about
0.68 eV per Cu-O bond which is a relatively weak bond.
A simple analysis of integrating charge density around
each atom inside an atomic sphere of arbitrary radius
shows the Cu atom to be in the +1 charge state and the
O atoms in the -2 charge state. There is very little spin
density on the Cu atom and most of the spin density is
seen on the O2 units. This is consistent with the param-
agnetic nature of O2 molecule. The spin density is largest
on the O atoms farthest from the Cu atom.

x = 1−3, 6. The vibrationally stability of the isomers was
examined by carrying out an analysis of the vibrational
modes. A bent structure with Cs symmetry is found to be
the most stable structure for CuO2. On the other hand,
a Y shaped structure with C2v symmetry is the lowest
energy structure for CuO3. Our study shows the poten-
tial energy surface is rather ﬂat for CuO6. Within our
fairly exhaustive search we ﬁnd two energetically nearly
degenerate isomers as possible candidate structures for
the ground state. Both of these structures contain CuO2
subunits. This observation is consistent with the argu-
ment by Wang and coworkers based on the PES but it
rules out their proposal of the structural form. Further,
contrary to the earlier pseudopotential based study, the
structures with ozonide subunits are found to be high

energy isomers. The anionic clusters show trends similar
to those of their neutral counterparts. The CuO6 cluster
in its most stable form is found to be strongly IR ac-
tive. The IR active modes correspond to the O-O bond
stretching and generally have high frequencies.

Abstract. Dissociation and ﬁssion of small neutral, singly and doubly charged
strontium clusters are studied by means of ab initio density functional theory methods
and high-resolution time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry. Magic numbers for small
strontium clusters possessing enhanced stability towards monomer evaporation and
ﬁssion are determined. It is shown that ionization of small strontium clusters results
in the alteration of the magic numbers. Thermal promotion of the Coulombic ﬁssion

Stability of Small Neutral and Charged Strontium Clusters

2

Processes leading to the instability and the ﬁssion of metal clusters are among the
most fundamental in cluster science, see e.g.
Investigation of the metal clusters
decay provides a direct tool for studying intrinsic stability and binding forces of these
objects. Such investigations attract an increased interest, because the general features
of metal clusters decay and nuclear ﬁssion are quite similar.

[1].

One can distinguish two classes of phenomena in the decay of metal clusters. The
ﬁrst one is dissociation or evaporation of fragments due to vibrational excitation, that
makes cluster thermally metastable. The second one is ﬁssion that occurs when the
repulsive Coulombic forces associated with an excess of charge overcome the electronic
binding energy of the cluster [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Multiply charged metal clusters are stable
towards ﬁssion when their size exceeds the critical size of stability, which depends on
the type of metal species and the cluster charge [8, 9]. In the latter case evaporation
is the dominant channel of cluster decay. For the cluster sizes smaller than the critical
size ﬁssion becomes more favorable [10].

The most sophisticated situation arises when the cluster size approaches the
“critical size” region. It has been found experimentally that in this case the internal
thermal excitation can inﬂuence ﬁssion channels and promote the Coulombic ﬁssion
[11]. On the other hand ﬁssion into two charged fragments can stimulate an additional
ejection of neutral atom during or immediately after the system overcomes the ﬁssion
barrier. Such an interplay between the Coulombic ﬁssion and the evaporation processes
has recently been observed [12].

In this Letter we report the results of theoretical and experimental investigation
of stability of small neutral, singly and doubly charged strontium clusters towards the
emission of neutral and singly charged fragments. We show that the closure of electronic
shells of the valence electrons enhances the stability of small strontium clusters towards
monomer evaporation. We demonstrate that the ionization of small strontium clusters
results in the alteration of the magic numbers for strontium clusters. By ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations we determine the critical appearance size for doubly
charged strontium clusters as well as the region of cluster sizes in which the strong
competition between evaporation and ﬁssion takes place. We predict theoretically
the thermal promotion of the Coulombic ﬁssion for the Sr2+
cluster and conﬁrm the
7
assumption made in [12] about the strong shape deformation of the ﬁssioning Sr2+
7
cluster.

The experimental setup is similar to that used in previous works [12, 13].
Calculations have been performed with the use of a core-polarization potential to
simulate the 1s22s22p63s23p63d10 core electrons of the Sr atom. The density-functional
theory based on the hybrid Becke-type three-parameter exchange functional paired with
the gradient-corrected Perdew-Wang 91 correlation functional (B3PW91) has been used
throughout this work (see, e.g., [14, 15] and references therein). Such an approach
has proved to be a reliable tool for ab initio studies of the structure and properties
of strontium clusters [16]. To ﬁnd the optimized geometry of a cluster we have used
the procedure described in [17, 18]. The results of cluster geometry optimization and

analysis of various isomer forms for neutral, singly and doubly charged small strontium
clusters will be discussed in detail elsewhere [19]. Calculations have been carried out
with the use of the GAUSSIAN 03 software package [20]. The SDD basis set of primitive
Gaussians has been used to expand the cluster orbitals (see, e.g., [14] and references
therein).

at N = 4, 7 and 10 correspond to the most stable conﬁgurations of neutral Sr-clusters
towards monomer evaporation SrN → Sr + SrN −1. The same magic numbers have also
been obtained from the analysis of binding energies of small neutral strontium [19] and
magnesium [18] clusters. The electronic conﬁguration of the strontium atom is [Kr]5s2,
which means that there are two valence electrons per atom. Accounting for the semi-
core 4p electrons of strontium simultaneously with the valence electrons increases the
absolute value of the binding energy by about 10-20% although it does not change the
general qualitative trends in the properties of small strontium clusters [22]. Therefore,

one can state that the most stable magic clusters Sr4, Sr7 and Sr10 possess Nel = 8, 14
and 20 valence electrons respectively, which is in agreement with the deformed jellium
model (see, e.g., [23, 24, 25, 26] and references therein as well as discussion in [18]).

Open circles in ﬁgure 1 show the singly charged monomer dissociation energies,

charged Sr-clusters, Sr+
N → Sr+ + SrN −1, is strongly suppressed in comparison with
the evaporation of a neutral strontium atom, Sr+
N → Sr + Sr+
N −1. The singly charged
strontium dimer Sr+
2 is more stable towards decay in comparison with the neutral dimer.
This phenomenon has a simple physical explanation: the removed electron is taken from
the antibonding orbital, and thus cationic strontium dimer is stronger bounded. The
similar eﬀect has been discussed for cationic magnesium clusters in [18].

The local maxima in the size dependence of the neutral monomer dissociation

7 clusters indicate their enhanced stability towards
monomer evaporation. Figure 1 clearly demonstrates that the single ionization of small
strontium clusters results in the alteration of the magic numbers. The similar alteration
of the magic number from N = 4 for neutral to N = 5 for cationic magnesium clusters has
been noticed in our recent work [18]. This fact can be explained by the manifestation of
shell eﬀects. The singly charged alkaline earth metal clusters always possess odd number
of valence electrons and, thus, always contain open electronic shells. In this case the
enhanced stability of a singly charged alkaline earth metal cluster ion arises, when the
electronic conﬁguration of the ion has one hole in or an extra electron above the ﬁlled
shells [18]. Thus the electronic conﬁguration containing an extra electron becomes more
favorable for Sr+
5 .

The calculated values of D+,0

N,1 are in a good qualitative agreement with the
experimental results.
Theoretical curve reproduces all the features in the size
dependence of the dissociation energy obtained in experiment. However, the calculated
monomer dissociation energies for the Sr+
6 clusters underestimate the
experimental values by approximately 0.4 eV. This discrepancy can be attributed to the
distribution of daughter fragments registered in experiment over diﬀerent isomer states.
One can assume that after evaporation of a neutral monomer the resulting daughter
fragment remains not always in the ground state, but in one of the higher energy isomer
states. This brings the experimentally measured dissociation energies up. This fact is
not taken into account in the calculations reported. Therefore the monomer dissociation
energies calculated theoretically lay lower those measured in the experiment. The results
of geometry optimization of diﬀerent isomer states of small strontium clusters will be
discussed elsewhere [19].

Figure 2 shows the monomer dissociation energies for doubly charged Sr-clusters
as a function of cluster size. Filled and open triangles represent the neutral and singly
charged monomer dissociation energies, D2+,0

note that the decay of doubly charged parent cluster into two singly charged daughter
fragments usually involves the overcoming a ﬁssion barrier caused by the Coulombic

repulsion, while evaporation is the barrierless process [5, 10]. Therefore, the values
D2+,+
characterize the energy balance between the initial and the ﬁnal states of the
N,1
system and do not give direct information about the fragmentation rate, because the
ﬁssion rate is usually determined by the ﬁssion barrier. Filled circles in ﬁgure 2 show the
size dependence of the ﬁssion barriers calculated for the process Sr2+
N −1.
To calculate the ﬁssion barriers we use the procedure described in detail in our recent
works [27, 28, 29]. The doubly charged strontium clusters with the number of atoms
N = 5 and 8 possess enhanced stability towards the neutral monomer evaporation as
well as towards the Coulombic ﬁssion with ejection of a singly charged monomer.

N → Sr+ + Sr+

For small doubly charged strontium clusters with the number of atoms N ≤ 7 the
neutral monomer dissociation energy, D2+,0
N,1 , exceeds signiﬁcantly the ﬁssion barrier.
Therefore, in this cluster size region ﬁssion prevails over neutral monomer evaporation.
As the cluster size increases the ﬁssion barrier becomes comparable and exceeds the
dissociation energy. In the size region 8 ≤ N ≤ 10 the height of the ﬁssion barrier and
D2+,0
N,1 become almost equal resulting in the competition of the ﬁssion and the evaporation
processes. For larger cluster sizes neutral monomer evaporation dominates over ﬁssion.
To ﬁnd the critical size of stability at which clusters undergo Coulombic ﬁssion it is
necessary to analyze the energy balance for all possible ﬁssion channels as a function of
cluster size. Figure 3 shows the energy release, D2+,+
N,P , as a function of diﬀerent ﬁssion
channels P in the process Sr2+
N −P for the doubly charged strontium clusters
with the number of atoms up to N = 11. Coulombic ﬁssion takes place when the energy
release is negative, which means that the ﬁnal state of the system is energetically more
favorable in comparison with the initial state of the parent cluster. We found that the

critical appearance size for the doubly charged strontium clusters is equal to Napp =
8. For the strontium clusters with N ≥ 8 the energy release is positive for all ﬁssion
channels. In this case cluster can decay via ﬁssion only if it possesses enough vibrational
energy to promote the Coulombic ﬁssion.

The results of our ab initio calculations of the critical appearance size for doubly
charged strontium clusters are in a good agreement with those derived from experiment
[4, 11]. Doubly charged strontium clusters with number of atoms N ≥ Napp are directly
observed in the mass spectrum.

For the Sr2+

energetically. Singly charged strontium clusters always possess odd number of valence
electrons and, thus, the interpretation of shell eﬀects in terms of electronic shell closings
is not straightforward. In this case, the enhanced stability of singly charged strontium
clusters arises, when the electronic conﬁguration of the cluster has one hole in or an
extra electron above the ﬁlled shells [18]. This rule explains the manifestation of shell
eﬀects in ﬁssion of doubly charged strontium clusters.

The most complex situation with ﬁssion occurs when the cluster size lays in the
“critical size” region. Thus, the Sr2+
cluster is the largest doubly charged strontium
7
cluster which can spontaneously decay via the Coulombic ﬁssion. The following two
channels Sr2+

it is seen from ﬁgure 4. Therefore the ejection of the singly charged monomer Sr+ is the
dominant ﬁssion channel for low cluster temperatures. As the temperature increases,
the probability of ejection of the dimer Sr+
2 grows. The similar eﬀect was observed for
the triply-charged strontium cluster Sr3+

19 in [11].

The ﬁssion barrier maxima are located at small separation distances (dmax ≈ 9.5
˚A) just before the scission point. At such distances the parent cluster is strongly
deformed. This shape deformation inﬂuences the dynamics of the ﬁssion and can induce,
by dissipative eﬀects, the ejection of a fast neutral atom [12].

In conclusion, experimentally measured dissociation energies are in agreement
with those derived from our ab initio calculations. We determine the cluster magic
numbers possessing the enhanced stability towards monomer evaporation and ﬁssion.
We demonstrate that the ionization of small strontium clusters results in the alteration
of the magic numbers. The critical appearance size for the doubly charged strontium
clusters determined theoretically is in a good agreement with experimental observations.
Thermal promotion of the Coulombic ﬁssion for the Sr2+
7

cluster is predicted.

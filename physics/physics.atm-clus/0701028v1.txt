Abstract

Inspired by recent experiments on fully spin polarized Na clusters, we perform
a systematic survey of neutral Na clusters at all conceivable spin polarizations. We
study the impact of spin state on ionic conﬁguration, on global shape, and on optical
response. For small clusters, the magic electronic shell at 4 spin-up electrons is a
dominating feature leading to preferred binding for all clusters having four spin-up
electrons (combined with 1 to 4 spin-down electrons). Such a preference fades away
for larger systems where the unpolarized state is generally preferred.

1 Introduction

Clusters in contact with a medium display a rich variety of possibilities not accessible
with merely free clusters. A typical example is here a medium consisting out of

various dynamical eﬀects on small molecules and clusters [1]. It has also been used
as a tool to produce free Mg clusters [2]. Accordingly, there exist several publications

1

investigating the cluster-medium interaction, see e.g. [3, 4]. A particularly interesting
eﬀect emerges, if Na is brought into contact with the drops. Sodium atoms can then
form clusters on the surface and the high volatility of the drop acts as a criterion to
select fully spin-polarized Na clusters [5]. A series of such clusters has been observed
up to N = 16 [6]. We take these recent experiments as motivation for a theoretical
survey of spin-polarized Na clusters. The aim of this paper is to investigate from a
theoretical perspective the structure and optical response of small neutral N a clusters
(up to N = 10) at all conceivable spin states. Selected examples of clusters with
spontaneous spin-polarization had been studied in earlier publications [7, 8]. Here
we aim at a more systematic survey going up to the extremes of fully spin-polarized
systems. We use the same tools as in previous publications, namely (time-dependent)
density-functional theory for electrons and simulated annealing for ionic structure
optimization. The sequence of deﬁnite spins is produced by ﬁxing the spin state of
the cluster. The stability of fully spin-polarized conﬁgurations is checked by allowing
the spins to vary freely.

2 Formal framework

2.1 Approach and computational scheme

The electron cloud of the clusters is described by density-functional theory at the level
of the local spin-density approximation (LSDA) using the density functional of Ref. [9]
which is known to perform reliably well also in the spin channel. We complement that
by a self-interaction correction with the average-density approach (ADSIC) [10]. This
provides correct ionization potentials and an appropriate asymptotic tail of the density.
The coupling of ions to electrons is described by a local pseudo-potential which has
been proven to yield correct ground state and optical excitation properties of simple
sodium clusters [11]. The spin-orbit force is negligible for Na. This means that spin
is totally decoupled from spatial properties and there is rotational invariance in spin
space. It is to be expected that stationary states have collinear spin distributions and
integer total spin. We have checked that by allowing non-collinear spin (for details
see section 2.2) and we ﬁnd indeed collinear conﬁgurations throughout. Thus we
continue with computing the states with ﬁxed total z-component of spin in collinear
conﬁgurations. In that cases, there is one spin orientation throughout and its direction
is arbitrary. Clusters are characterized then by their net polarization which is obtained
as the sum of the single z-component Sz = sz. A coupling to good total spin produces
a sum of Slater states. This is what is called a correlated state. It goes outside the
realm of density functional theory. Within LSDA we have at hand only the total

2

z-component S = Sz and we take that to characterize the spin state of the system.
It is to be noted that it is just that Sz which couples to an external magnetic ﬁeld.
We thus have an appropriate measure of the magnetic response of the cluster within
LSDA, similar as it was studied before, e.g., in [7].

The electron wavefunctions are represented on an equidistant grid in three-dimensional

coordinate space. The electronic ground state solution is found by iterative relaxation
[13]. The electronic net spin is chosen at the initialization stage and stays unchanged
throughout the relaxation. The ionic conﬁgurations are optimized by simulated an-
nealing [14]. To compute the optical response, we propagate the electronic dynamics at
ﬁxed ionic conﬁguration. Propagation is done with time-dependent LSDA (TDLSDA)
using the time-splitting method [15]. To compute the spectral distributions, we per-
form a spectral analysis after the TDLDA propagation [16, 17]. This means that we
initialize the dynamics by a small instantaneous boost of the center-of-mass of the
electron cloud. The dipole moment is recorded during time evolution. A Fourier anal-
ysis into frequency domain then ﬁnally yields the spectral strength. For all technical
details see the review [18].

2.2 Collinearity

The explicit treatment of spins allows still two options: one can assume that all spins
are aligned (collinear) or one allows for non-collinearity as it is necessary, e.g.
for
magnetic materials [12]. Materials with negligible spin-orbit coupling, as e.g. Na,
should have always collinear spin. Nonetheless, we have checked that in detail using
the code of [12]. For a handful of test cases, we initialize the electronic conﬁguration
in a non-collinear state and watch the evolution of that during ground-state iteration.
We always ﬁnd a quick convergence towards collinear conﬁgurations. One example is
shown in ﬁgure 1. The energy variance in the upper panel serves to demonstrate the
overall convergence pattern. It remains to quantify the non-collinearity in one simple
number. To that and, we evaluate the spin-orientation σα for each electron state α

seperately, compute the angle between all pairs of electrons, and ﬁnally add up the
quadratic deviations. This yields the “non-collinearity” as

the spin in units of ¯h/2. That
where ˆσ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, i.e.
measure is shown in the lower panel of ﬁgure 1. One sees a quick convergence to
collinearity, an interesting interludium where non-collinearity pops up again to foster
a quick transition into a better conﬁguration, and ﬁnally a stable collinear state. All
cases studied showed the same stable ﬁnal convergence to a collinear conﬁguration.
Thus we use the code with (much faster) thoroughly collinear handling of spin.

However, the non-collinear confgurations become important for detailed studies of
spin stability. Each spin state is conserved for the present energy functional.
It is
only by perturbations, namely a small sin-orbit coupling in the pseudo-potentials or
external magnetic ﬁelds, that the spin states can mix and undergo transitions which
possibly run through non-collinear conﬁguration as transitional stages. Such studies
go beyond the scope and limitations of the present paper. We will adopt, in accordance
with experimental claims [6], that the spin states once prepared stay stable for the
necessary analyzing time.

In a ﬁrst round we investigate the structure of polarized Na clusters. For a given size

For each spin state S = N↑

a consequence, we generate all ground state conﬁgurations for systems (N, S) with
N = 3, .., 8, 10 and all S as given above. One can now imagine that a given ground
S′. The ions readjust to the new
state for (N, S) may undergo a sudden spin ﬂip S
S′ very slowly. Electronic relaxation is much faster. We thus obtain a transient cluster
with ionic structure of (N, S) but electronic structure readjusted to S′. The following
ﬁgures show results for all the ground states as well as for all possible combinations to
S′. The ionic conﬁgurations used are distinguished by line types,

These ﬁgures are all built according to the same scheme and we discuss them in
one stroke. Looking at the binding energies, we see (with few exceptions) that the
energies for diﬀerent ionic conﬁgurations but same net spin gather in densely packed
small blocks while large energy shifts emerge when changing electronic net spin. The
binding energies thus depend predominantly on the electronic net spin while details
of the ionic conﬁguration make less eﬀect, although there can be substantial ionic
rearranegements, particularly for the smaller clusters. Questions of spin stability may
thus be discussed in a ﬁrst step on grounds of electronic dynamics (as done to some
extend in section 2.2). The ionic rearrangement follows in a second step. This view
is not only suggested by energetic considerations but also for reasons of time scale.
Electronic transitions run at the order of a few fs while ionic motion takes hundreths
of fs.

The radii basically follow the trends of the binding energy, deeper binding relates to
smaller radii. This holds strictly for the cases where electrons and ionic conﬁguration
are simultaneously optimized (bars distinguished by circles in the ﬁgures). The other
combinations of electron spin and ionic conﬁgurations show variations which are larger
than the respective variations in energy and which can, in contrast to the energy, vary
in both directions around the optimized result. The deformation parameters β and γ
also show large variations with ionic conﬁguration at given net spin. These variations
are as large, often even larger, as the changes with net spin. This happens because
the electrons like to follow the given ionic shape in order to minimize the Coulomb
energy [20].

The relation between electronic and ionic shape is visible in ﬁgure 7. It shows the
shape parameters for both species (ionic with stars, electronic with circles). Ionic and
electronic radii follow precisely the same trend. But the electronic radius is systemati-
cally larger than the ionic radius. This is due to the much smoother electronic surface
distribution. The deformation parameters β and γ coincide for electrons and ions.
This demonstrates that the electrons follow the ionic distribution or vice versa.
It
becomes fully obvious when looking at the β and γ across the various spins and com-
paring results only for the same line type which means the same ionic conﬁguration.
In this way, the results show much less variation.

Let us now concentrate on the simultaneously optimized conﬁgurations (indicated
by circles in the ﬁgures), i.e. the electronic plus ionic ground states at given spin, and
let us go through the examples top down, i.e. from the largest sample to the smallest.
Figure 8 for Na10 shows the expected trends. The unpolarized conﬁguration is the
preferred one and there is a steadily increasing energy towards the fully polarized
case. Two details go a bit against these general trends. First, the case with net spin 2
has very small energy diﬀerence to the spin 0 ground state. This conﬁguration consists
out of 6 spin-up with 4 spin-down electrons and the 4 electrons of one spin constitute

a magic electron shell. The slight “magicity” can also be read oﬀ from the dip of the
deformation β at spin 2. The second detail concerns the state with spin 10. The very
small β there indicates a nearly spherical shape. Again we meet a magic number where
10 electrons of one spin form a closed shell. In this case, the “magicity” is not strong
enough to be honored by the binding energy. But it suﬃces to drive the spherical
shape.

The results for Na8 in ﬁgure 7 come even closer to what one would have naively
expected. There is an almost equidistant rise in energy and radius with increasing
spin. But mind that we have here an enhanced preference of the unpolarized state by
a fully developed magic electron number at spin 0, namely 4 electrons spin-up and 4
spin-down. This is corroborated by the fact that this system again has low β and is
thus close to spherical shape. The case of Na7 in ﬁgure 6 is much similar to Na8. No
surprise, because the lowest spin 1 coincides again with the magic electron closure of
the 4 spin-up electrons. Comparing the cases Na8 and Na7 with Na10, we conclude
that there is a general trend toward unpolarized systems, but that shell closures can
change the picture in detail. That means that small net spin may emerge as ground
state conﬁguration if one spin species has a magic electron number and the other
species just suﬃces to compensate to net spin 2, or 3 respectively. This eﬀect will
become more obvious for the smaller systems.

The example of Na6 shown in ﬁgure 5 is the ﬁrst case where shell closure is com-
pensating the trend to zero polarization. The global ground state happens to be
conﬁguration with spin 2, not surprisingly just the case covering a magic shell of 4
spin-up electrons. The radius follows the trend of the energy, and last not least, the
“magicity” is again indicated by a drop in deformation β. The situation is similar
again in the next lower Na5 cluster. The ground state is here with spin 3 because
this contains the magic shell of 4 spin-up electrons. In both examples, however, the
notion of a ground state conﬁguration has to be taken with a grain of salt. The energy
diﬀerence to the minimum spin state is extremely small. A clear clut decision between
ground state and ﬁrst isomer may be beyond the reliability of LSDA. In any case,
the qualitative result will persist, namely that the spontanously spin polarized state
is competitive with the minimum spin state. And this has interesting consquences on
the magnetic response as was discussed in [7].

The fully spin polarized Na4 is again close to spherical in compliance with the
shell closure at N = 4 spin-up electrons. However, the energetically favored ground
31 having net spin 2. The price for full spin polarization is
state conﬁguration is Na4
here higher than the gain from shell closure. Finally, nothing peculiar can be seen for
the smallest system Na3. It is necessarily a ﬂat object and thus has always a certain
deformation. Note that triaxiality γ is not so well deﬁned and thus ﬂuctuates for such
a small system.

The small clusters Na4 and Na5 show a strong dependence of the shape on spin.
The unpolarized conﬁgurations are planar while the spin polarized states extend in
three dimensions. This is due to the drive of the Nspinup = 4 shell to sphericity. The
diﬀerences in shape become less dramatic with increasing N . But one still has for
any N the inﬂuence of magic Nspinup producing minima in β. The eﬀect is obvious
for the Nspinup = 4 shell. But one sees it also on the β from the softer Nspinup = 10
shell. There is a pronounced minimum for Na10. For Na8, the maximum β is precisely
in between 4 and 10 whereas the fully polarized Na8 clearly shows the descend of β
toward the magic shell.

Besides total energies, ﬁgures 2–8 provide also the ionization potentials (IP) of
the various spin conﬁgurations. The IP characterizes the stability of a system against
removal of an electron. The magic shell Nspinup = 4 is clearly visible. The overall
pattern show the typical stepping up above at Nspinup = 4 because the 1p state is fully
occupied and the less well bound 1d state is going to become ﬁlled. The spin-saturated
full-shell case (N, Nspinup) = (8, 4) is best bound. However, the diﬀerences to all others
cases are very small.

A word is in place here about Hund’s rules. These are formulated for atoms and
they state that electrons in an open shell arrange themselves into a maximal spin-
polarization to render the ground state non-degenerate. Clusters have an alternative,
and more eﬀective, way to arrange an unambiguous ground state, the Jahn-Teller
eﬀect, i.e. they drive into a deformation for which the electron occupation is unique.
The two mechanisms compete and the Jahn-Teller deformation usually wins. Still,
there are occasionally spin polarized isomers in clusters with truly triaxial shapes
[7, 35]. These previous studies considered only small polarization up to net spin two.
The present investigation goes up to any spin and reveals that shell closures for spin-
polarized systems add an extra preference for electron number 4 (and 10) in one spin
species. The extra binding leads to spin polarized ground states in very small Na
clusters. It is so to say Hund’s rules enhanced by shell eﬀects.

3.2 Optical response

It is also interesting to investigate the key feature of cluster excitations, namely the
optical response of polarizd clusters. Thus we investigate the dipole strength of the
various clusters in our sample. Thereby we conﬁne considerations to ionic conﬁgu-
rations which are relaxed for given net spin. Figure 9 shows the dipole spectra all
in the same manner for a selection of two clusters and conﬁgurations. The dipole
strengths are evaluated along the principal axes which are usually very close to the
optical axes of the clusters (the optical axes are those for which the dipole response
tensor is diagonal). The comparison of spectra can be helpful to discriminate diﬀer-

ent spin states where they may compete in practice. The case becomes of course a
bit academic for the high lying isomers because these are quickly destabilized by any
additional excitation.

Before starting the detailed discussion, let us brieﬂy recall the basic features of
dipole spectra in metal clusters [18, 21]. The average position is roughly estimated
by the Mie surface plasmon frequency. The total strength (according to the dipole
sum rule) is contained to about 90% in the Mie plasmon resonance which can be very
well computed in purely collective models [21, 26, 27]. The remaining strength is
found in secondary surface plasmons and to a lesser extend in the volume plasmon.
There are two mechanisms which produce a spread of the spectra around the average
surface plasmon frequency. The global quadrupole deformation of the cluster leads
to a splitting of the plasmon which can still be described at a collective level. The
oscillations along the elongated axes are red shifted while those along the squeezed
axes are blue shifted [28]. This deformation splitting is an important tool for assessing
the deformation of small clusters [29, 30, 31]. The other source of spectral broadening
is due to the coupling of the resonance to nearby one-particle-one-hole 1ph state. It
is called Landau fragmentation because it is the ﬁnite systems analogue of Landau
damping in the electron gas of a plasma. This eﬀect sensitively depends on the details
of the shell structure. As a rough rule one can say that Landau fragmentation becomes
increasingly important the larger the clusters [21, 32]. For small clusters it plays a
role in connection with broken parity symmetry [18].

In the following we discuss ﬁgure 9. We do also comment brieﬂy on the results
and trends obtained for other clusters even if the corresponding spectra are not dis-
played here. There are of course large diﬀerences concerning the degree of splitting or
fragmentation, as a function of size and spin. The cleanest plasmon peaks are found
systematically whenever the magic Nspinup = 4 is involved which happens for the con-

into three distinct center frequencies for the three directions. Additionally, there is
some Landau fragmentation for the z-mode. Altogether, we see that the simple rules
of deformation splitting are well observed. The same holds for all other examples.
The amount of Landau fragmentation is hard to predict in general terms. But the
tendency that well bound magic shapes have less fragmentation is conﬁrmed. The
overall trend of average frequency with radius cannot easily be read oﬀ from the
sometimes much split and fragmented spectra. Looking at the sequence a bit longer,
one can see through the fuzzy pattern the expected trend, namely that the largest

Previous studies have shown that small Na clusters possess spin-dipole modes around
1 eV and that spin-polarized clusters show cross talks between dipole and spin-dipole
modes [33, 34]. We have checked that the small strength above 1 eV seen here is
indeed due to cross talk with the spin-dipole mode.

33. A hint of strength at 1.5 eV shows up in Na6

Checking from that viewing angle ﬁgure 9 again, we see that the low lying strength
in the fully polarized clusters diﬀers very much for the various systems in the sample.
The point is that the spin-dipole modes and the Mie plasmon mode in the dipole
channel diﬀer very much in their collectivity. Unlike the Mie plasmon mode, the spin-
dipole experiences only a small residual Coulomb interaction (because the shifts of
spin-up cloud and spin-down cloud go into opposite directions). It resides practically
at pure 1ph energies. The 1ph energies, in turn, are determined by the spectral gap
at the Fermi energy (HOMO-LUMO gap). And this gap depends on shell structure.
Magic electron numbers, N=4 and 10, have a larger gap than intermediate systems.

4 Conclusions

We have investigated from a theoretical perspective the properties of small Na clusters
at systematially varied spin polarization. We used as tool density-functional calcu-
lations at the level of the local-density approximation together with local pseudo-
potentials for the coupling of Na ions to the valence electrons. In a ﬁrst step, we have
checked possible non-collinearity of the spins. We ﬁnd always fully collinear electron
conﬁgurations for this simple material Na.

Electronic and ionic structure for small clusters has been discussed as well as
optical response. Fully spin polarzed clusters display also a sequence of magic electron
numbers which are just half of the magic numbers of spin saturated Na clusters. In our
sample, we see the impact of the magic Nspinup = 4 = 8/2 and N spinup = 10 = 20/2.
at various places. Magic Nspinup drive the system to minimum deformation, minimal
radii, and relatively lower energies. As a consequence, several clusters show a large
rearrangement of the ionic conﬁguration when changing spin polarization.

We have also investigated optical response because it might provide a useful indi-
cator of the underlying spin and ion structure. For the small clusters studied here,
unpolarized systems show clean Mie plasmon resonances with a collective splitting
directly related to the quadrupole deformation while the spectra of spin-polarized
clusters show occasionally more fragmentation due to cross talk with spin modes.

The question of the life-time for highly spin-polarized clusters remains beyond the

scope of this paper. It will be attacked in a next step.

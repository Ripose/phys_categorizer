Abstract

Multipole electron modes beyond the Mie plasmon in atomic clusters are investigated within

the time-dependent local density approximation theory (TD-LDA). We consider the origin of the

modes, their connection with basic cluster properties and possible routes of experimental obser-

vation. Particular attention is paid to infrared magnetic orbital modes, scissors and twist, and

electric quadrupole mode. The scissors and twist modes determine orbital magnetism of clusters

while the electric quadrupole mode provides direct access to the single electron spectra of the

cluster. We examine two-photon processes (Raman scattering, stimulated emission pumping and

stimulated adiabatic Raman passage) as the most promising tools for experimental investigation

of the modes.

INTRODUCTION

Besides the dominant dipole Mie plasmon, many other electron modes, both electric and

magnetic, can exist in atomic clusters [1]. These modes are known in diverse many-body

systems (atomic nuclei, quantum dots, dilute gas of trapped fermionic and bosonic atoms,

etc). It is a demanding problem to observe them in atomic clusters. The multipole electron

modes represent an essential part of electron dynamics in both collective and electron-hole

domains. They are connected with basic cluster properties and thus can serve as an eﬀective

tool for their investigation.

We will pay the main attention to three infrared modes: scissors magnetic dipole (M1),

twist magnetic quadrupole (M2) and electric quadrupole (E2). These modes are connected

basic properties of atomic clusters. Besides, they are the strongest spin-saturated modes

beyond the Mie plasmon.

The scissors and twist modes are of orbital magnetic character [2, 3, 4, 5]. In general, the

scissors mode exists only in deformed systems. It dominates the Van Vleck paramagnetism

[3, 6] and can result in dia-para magnetic anisotropy in particular light atomic clusters

[6]. The twist mode is the strongest magnetic orbital mode in spherical clusters where the

scissors mode vanishes [5].

It is mainly generated by transitions between electron levels

with maximal orbital moments. Altogether, the scissors and twist modes are fundamental

sources of orbital magnetism in spin-saturated clusters. In deformed clusters, the scissors

M1 is coupled to electric quadrupole E2 mode.

The infrared E2 mode is most interesting in two particular cases of deformed clusters:

free light deformed clusters and embedded oriented rods (strongly prolate large clusters). In

the ﬁrst case, the E2 mode is reduced to a few electron-hole excitations driven by cluster

deformation. As was recently demonstrated, these excitations allow to determine the mean

ﬁeld spectra of light clusters [7]. Being sensitive to cluster structure, these spectra can deliver

important information on diverse cluster features. And last, but not least, the infrared

electron-hole quadrupole excitations have a good chance to be observed in particular two-

photon processes.

Infrared E2 modes in oriented silver rods embedded into glass matrices [8, 9] represent

another useful example of non-dipole electron motion in clusters. These modes are collective

and in principle can be studied in Raman scattering (experiments of this kind are in progress

2

[10]). Because of the extreme axis ratio, rods represent a unique sample for investigation of

both E2 and M1 (scissors) collective motion.

Being non-dipole, the infrared multipole states cannot be populated by one-photon tran-

sitions which excite exclusively dipole modes. Thus one has to use two-photon processes

(TPP) where the target state is populated via an intermediate dipole state by two (absorp-

tion and emission) dipole transitions. The dipole plasmon or isolated dipole states can serve

as the intermediate state. Some of the processes, Raman scattering (RS), stimulated emis-

sion pumping (SEP), and stimulated adiabatic Raman passage (STIRAP), are widely used

in atomic and molecular spectroscopy to populate non-dipole modes but their applications

to clusters are still very limited and, at a ﬁrst glance, even questionable. The problems are

caused by particular clusters properties (dense spectra, broad level structures, harmonicity

of collective modes, short lifetimes, non-radiative decay channels, etc) which can hamper

TPP. Nevertheless, we will show that TPP listed above can be applied to clusters and deliver

valuable information on cluster properties (see preliminary discussion and ﬁrst estimations

in [7]). Speciﬁc requirements to TPP applications will be considered in detail.

The manuscript provides a survey of explorations from a theoretical perspective. To

that end, we employ the microscopic time-dependent local-density-approximation (TDLDA)

theories in the linear regime [11] and beyond it [12, 13]. The main aim of our study is to

outline non-dipole electron modes in clusters and encourage their investigation in TPP

The paper is outlined as follows. In Sec. II, we give a brief overview of infrared multipole

modes, clarify their origin and connection with basic cluster features. In Sec. III, the two-

photon processes RS, SEP and STIRAP are inspected as possible routes of experimental

study of the modes. Mainly free light deformed clusters are considered. A summary is given

experiments.

in Sec. IV.

II. HIERARCHY OF MULTIPOLE MODES

A. Classiﬁcation scheme

Multipole modes are oscillations of multipolarity λµ which are typical for ﬁnite many-

body systems. It is useful to distinguish collective and non-collective multipole modes. In

3

the ﬁrst case, one deals with a superposition of many elementary excitations which form

a coherent motion while in the second case the mode represents a mixture of only a few

elementary excitations. In mesoscopic systems with 10

104 particles, we have an interme-

−

diate (and maybe the most complicated) situation when a large number of small elementary

components contribute coherently and thus form the collective part of the mode while a

few dominant components determine its particle-hole structure. Just such systems will be

considered in the present study. More speciﬁcally, we will deal with metal clusters where

valence electrons move freely in a common mean ﬁeld. The single-particle levels of the mean

ﬁeld are bunched into quantum shells [14, 15] which constitute a key point in understanding

the nature of multipole modes and their classiﬁcation.

A useful sorting scheme for single-particle levels of valence electrons in metal clusters is

provided by the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator [14, 15, 16]. The levels of a spher-

ical cluster are sorted in perfectly degenerate bunches (major quantum shells) which are

characterized by the principle quantum number

= 0, 1, 2, .... The shells are separated

N

by appreciable energy gaps and every shell involves only states of the same space parity

π = (

1)N . This oscillator picture is well fulﬁlled in light clusters and provides still a good

−

approximation in medium and heavy ones. In axially deformed clusters, the single-electron

levels are characterized by Nilsson-Clemenger quantum numbers ν = [

nzΛ] where the

N

principle shell number

= nz + 2nr + Λ is expressed through the numbers of nodes in

N

radial (nr) and symmetry axis (nz) directions and projection Λ of the orbital moment onto

the symmetry axis [16].

Following this scheme, excitations of valence electrons are characterized by the ∆

value,

the diﬀerence in shell for the dominant 1eh jumps. Quadrupole excitations have even parity

and are collected into the branches ∆

= 0 and 2. The excitations with larger ∆

are

weak and can be neglected. The branch ∆

= 0 has low excitation energy. It exists only

N

N

in deformed systems (with partly occupied valence shell) and vanishes in spherical systems

(with fully occupied valence shell). In the next subsections, we will use this sorting scheme

for explanation of the origin and properties of quadrupole E2, scissors M1 and twist M2

and hexadecapole deformation parameters are indicated in boxes. RPA results are given as vertical

bars (in eV ˚A2) and as a strength function smoothed by the Lorentz weight with the averaging

parameter 0.25 eV. Separate contributions to the strength function from the λµ =10 and 11 dipole

branches (the latter is twice stronger) are shown by dash curves. The experimental data (triangles)

from [21] are given for the comparison.

B. Calculation scheme

The electron cloud is described by density-functional theory at the level of the local-

density approximation (LDA) for the ground state and time-dependent LDA (TDLDA) for

the excitations, using actually the functional of [17]. The ionic background of the cluster is

approximated by the soft jellium model allowing for quadrupole and hexadecapole deforma-

tions [13, 18]. In the analysis given in this section, the infrared modes stay in the regime of

small amplitudes. We thus employ the linearized TDLDA, often called the random-phase-

approximation (RPA). The actual implementation for axially symmetric clusters is explained

in [11]. The reliability of the method has been checked in diverse studies of the Mie plasmon

in spherical [19] and deformed [11, 20] clusters. As an example, Fig. 1 demonstrates quite

5

w
s
good agreement of our results with the experimental data [21] for the dipole plasmon in light

deformed clusters at room temperature.

The proper choice of the light clusters to be studied is very important.

i) The clusters

should be small enough to possess a dilute and non-collective infrared spectrum. Only then

the spectrum can be resolved and unambiguously related to the single-particle levels.

ii)

Since infrared modes are mainly induced by cluster deformation (see discussion in the next

subsection), the clusters with a strong deformation (either prolate or oblate) are desirable.

The simplest case of axial shape is most suitable for the analysis. iii) Shape isomers exhibit

diﬀerent single-electron spectra [11, 20, 22], which can smear out the low-energy spectral

lines. The heavier clusters, the more isomers [11, 20]. So, light clusters with one dominant

equilibrium shape are preferable. Between them, we should choose the clusters whose ground

state and ﬁrst isomers have the similar (prolate or oblate) shape. Thus we will minimize

the spectral blurring.

iv) The jellium approximation is certainly rough for description of

details in light clusters, which establishes a lower limit for the cluster size. The results for

the smallest samples may not reach a quantitative level, but they are still useful for the

ﬁrst consideration. As is demonstrated in Fig. 1, even in the lightest clusters the jellium

TDLDA suﬃciently well reproduces the basic characteristics of the Mie plasmon (average

energy, principle gross-structure, magnitude of the deformation splitting of the resonance),

see for discussion [7, 20]. Such accuracy suﬃces for our present survey. For this reason, as

well as for the sake of simplicity, our study will exploit the jellium approximation.

C. Quadrupole mode

We start our analysis with quadrupole excitations in light deformed free sodium clusters.

The hierarchy of E2 modes is illustrated in Fig. 2 in terms of normalized quadrupole

modes are not observed in the photoabsorption, it is instructive for a ﬁrst overview. Let us

ﬁrst consider the strong quadrupole resonance appearing at high frequencies in the range

2-4 eV. In heavy clusters this resonance is associated with the quadrupole plasmon. The

resonance is mainly formed by E2 transitions over two major shells (∆

= 2). It exists in

clusters of any shape and exhausts most of the quadrupole strength. Though the resonance is

In the present study, we are not so much interested in the quadrupole plasmon but in

non-collective infrared quadrupole modes which can deliver important information about

the electron single-particle spectrum near the Fermi (=HOMO) level. The infrared spectra

are associated with the low-energy ∆

in deformed clusters. The deformation splits the

infrared quadrupole mode into branches λµ =20, 21 and 22. In Fig. 1, the infrared modes

reside at 0.5-1.5 eV. As compared with the quadrupole plasmon, the infrared spectrum is

very dilute. It is represented only by a few well separated levels. This prevents mixing of

1eh conﬁgurations by the residual interaction and creation of collective states. The infrared

quadrupole modes persist to keep their 1eh nature. As is seen from Fig. 1, they have very

weak quadrupole strength in the photoabsorption. But they may be accessible in two-photon

processes.

The infrared modes provide valuable information about cluster’s properties. As is seen

from 3, most of the transitions connect the levels arising due to deformation splitting. The

corresponding infrared modes are determined by the deformation and vanish at the spherical

shape. Thus they deliver information on the deformation splitting of the electron levels in

the HOMO-LUMO region. Besides, being combined with photoemission data for the spectra

of occupied electron states (see e.g. [24]), the infrared 1eh modes immediately yield energies

of unoccupied electron states. As a result, one can get the complete electron spectrum in

the HOMO-LUMO region. This spectrum is sensitive to diﬀerent cluster features (interplay

of equilibrium and isomer cluster’s shapes, ionic structure, correlations, temperature eﬀects,

etc.) and so can serve as an eﬀective tool for investigation of these features.

Finally, it is worth noting that in deformed systems the electric and magnetic modes

with the same projection µ and space parity π are mixed. The mixture of electric E21 and

magnetic orbital M11 excitations is especially interesting as it provides access to the orbital

M1 scissors mode [2, 4, 6]. The properties of this mode are sketched in the next subsection.

8

FIG. 4: Macroscopic view of scissors mode : rigid rotation [25] (left), and rotation within a rigid

surface [3] (right).

D. Scissors mode

The scissors mode (SM) is a general collective ﬂow already predicted or found in diﬀerent

ﬁnite quantum systems (atomic nuclei [25, 26], quantum dots [27] and ultra-cold superﬂuid

gas of fermionic atoms [28]). Besides, this mode is used as an indicator of Bose-Einstein

condensate in the dilute gas of trapped Bose atoms [29, 30]. In atomic clusters, the SM was

predicted [2, 4] but, in spite of some attempts [31], not yet observed. Obviously, the SM

demonstrates a universal character. It is pertinent to any ﬁnite systems with two features

in common: broken spherical symmetry (deformation) and a two-component nature. In the

systems listed above, these components are neutrons and protons in nuclei, valence electrons

and ions in atomic clusters, electrons and surrounding media in quantum dots, atoms and

the trap in dilute Fermi and Bose gases. The SM features were recently reviewed in [6].

1. Macroscopic view

The macroscopic collective nature of SM can be illustrated by the geometrical model ﬁrst

proposed for atomic nuclei [25]. For clusters, this model exhibits SM as scissors-like small-

amplitude oscillations of valence electrons versus the ions, both assumed to form distinct

spheroids (see left part of Fig. 4). Hence the name scissors mode. Obviously, such a mode

can exist only in deformed systems.

Following the alternative view of [3] (right part of Fig. 4), the displacement ﬁeld of the

9

mode is a sum of the rigid small-amplitude rotation and irrotational quadrupole term (the

latter provides vanishing velocity of electrons at the surface):

macroscopic treatments, [3, 25], include the rigid rotation of valence electrons versus the

ions with the restoring force originating from the Coulomb interaction between the electrons

and ions. But the model [3] has the additional irrotational quadrupole term. Its physical

sense becomes clear if we take into account that the SM, like the quadrupole E2 modes,

is separated into low-energy (∆

= 0) and high-energy (∆

= 2) branches. The ﬁrst

N

N

rotational term in (1) is responsible for the ∆

= 0 branch while the second irrotational

N

term generates the ∆

= 2 branch. Thus the branches have quite diﬀerent physical nature.

N

This feature is exploited as a signature of the Bose-Einstein condensate in dilute gas of

trapped Bose atoms [29, 30]. Unlike the normal phase which exhibits both SM branches,

the condensate phase supports only the irrotational ﬂow. So, a vanishing ∆

= 0 branch

N

serves as a ﬁngerprint of the condensate.

The rotational low-energy branch ∆

= 0 corresponds to a large extend to the scissors

N

scenario exhibited in left part of Fig. 4 and thus is usually treated as a true SM. In atomic

clusters, just this branch is responsible for van Vleck paramagnetism and other eﬀects of

orbital magnetism. In what follows, we will concentrate on this part of SM.

In axial clusters, the low-energy SM is generated by the orbital momentum ﬁelds Lx and

Ly perpendicular to the symmetry axis z. The mode is represented by the states

summed strength of the degenerated x- and y-branches. The z-branch vanishes for symmetry

10

reasons. It is worth noting that B(M1 transition strength does not depend on rs and so

is the same for diﬀerent metals. Both energy and magnetic strength are proportional to

the deformation parameter δ2 and thus vanish in spherical systems. So, the SM exists only

in system with a broken spherical symmetry. The larger the deformation, the stronger the

low-energy scissors mode.

It worth noting that we assume here global deformation of the system. At the same time,

spherical symmetry can be broken locally while keeping the global spherical shape. This

takes place, e.g., in spherical clusters where the ionic background as such destroys locally

the spherical symmetry and gives rise to some M1 (though rather weak) orbital strength

even with zero global deformation [32].

The irrotational ∆

= 2 branch of SM takes place in both systems, spherical and

deformed. Its energy maps the energy of the quadrupole plasmon. In fact the irrotational

SM is a part of this plasmon.

2. Microscopic view

N

The microscopic treatment of the SM is based on the shell structure of axially deformed
mean ﬁeld [4, 6]. The angular momenta orthogonal to the symmetry axis, ˆLx and ˆLy,

promote low-energy ∆

transitions across two shells.

It is instructive to expand the wave functions of the single-electron states in terms of the

splitting and so may be connected by M1 transitions with non-zero excitation energies. This

is the microscopic origin of the scissors mode. The energy scale of the scissors mode is

predominantly low-energy (∆

=0) character of the true SM.

N

There is an intimate connection between the scissors and quadrupole E21 modes in de-

formed clusters. If fact, both SM and E21 are parts of a general motion characterized by the

states

Λπ = 1+ >. To illustrate this point, let’s again consider Eq. (5). As was mentioned

|

above, the SM operator connects only components from one and the same basis level nL.
This is because the operators ˆLx and ˆLy have no r-dependent part and so, due to orthog-

onality of the radial wave functions RnL(r), cannot connect the components with diﬀerent
nL. But the latter can be done by the quadrupole operator r2Y21. In this sense the SM

operator is more selective than E21, though both operators generate transitions of the same

multipolarity. The states

Λπ = 1+ > involve both SM and E21 modes and respond to both

M11 and E21 external ﬁelds. The states are treated as magnetic or electric, depending on

each of the two responses dominates.

The dual nature of the states

Λπ = 1+ > is demonstrated in Fig. 5. The one-to-one

correspondence between the E21 and SM peaks takes place. These peaks represent 1eh states

15. The ﬁrst free states originate from the deformation splitting of spherical levels and

thus give rise to SM. In principle, these states carry both E21 and SM ﬂows and the ratio
between two contributions depends on the actual state structure. The plot for Na+

15 gives an

instructive example. It is seen that the lower peak determined by [211]

[202] transition

→

between the members of the deformation multiplet exhibits an appreciable magnetic dipole

strength and thus should carry a large SM fraction. Just such deformation-induced infrared

states provide access to SM. Instead, the higher peak is determined by a [211]

[200]

→

transition which takes place even in spherical case. The deformation is not crucial here.

This state favors the E21 ﬁeld and so can be treated as an ordinary quadrupole mode.

3. Eﬀects of orbital magnetism

Static orbital magnetism in clusters was widely explored during last decades. The stud-

ies were mainly based on the Landau theory of the atomic magnetism [33]. A variety of

issues was covered: giant dia- and paramagnetism in weak magnetic ﬁelds [34, 35], size

and temperature eﬀects [36, 37], manifestation of quantum supershells in magnetic suscep-

tibility [37], inﬂuence of cluster shape (both axial and triaxial) on the magnetic properties

[3, 38], anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in deformed clusters [3, 38], orbital magnetism

of supported clusters [39], etc..

In the present study, we will consider some principle points of the orbital magnetism,

connected with the scissors mode: the decisive role of SM in van Vleck paramagnetism

[3, 6] and the related eﬀect of dia-para anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility of particular

light clusters [6]. The latter eﬀect displays a peculiarity of small clusters to exhibit strong

variations in their properties with a cluster size. For example, RPA calculations [4, 6] show

that the SM energies and B(M1) strengths, though mainly scaling with the deformation δ2

and the electron number Ne according to the trends (2) and (3), demonstrate, nevertheless,

strong ﬂuctuations. This can aﬀect the magnetic susceptibility and lead, in particular cases,

to dia-para anisotropy.

recent review). Altogether, these properties may provide an interesting perspective for new

technologies.

E. Twist mode

strongest one [5].

The SM is the dominant orbital magnetic mode in deformed clusters. But in spheri-

cal clusters the SM vanishes and the next orbital magnetic mode, twist M2, becomes the

This twist was ﬁrst proposed as an quadrupole torsional vibrational ﬂow of an elastic globe
[40]. The mode is generated by the operator ˆT = e−iαzLz = eα~u· ~∇ with the velocity ﬁeld

16

~u = (yz,

xz, 0) and small angle α [40, 41]. The macroscopic image of twist is presented in

−

Fig. 7. The mode is treated as small-amplitude rotation-like oscillations of upper hemisphere

against the lower hemisphere. The rotational angle of horizontal layers is proportional to z

(projection to the axis of rotation). So, the ﬂow vanishes at the equator and poles of the

system.

The restoring force of the twist is determined by the quadrupole distortions of the Fermi

surface in the momentum space. So, the twist represents transverse magnetic quadrupole

oscillations of an elastic medium, generated by variation of the kinetic-energy density. The

twist is a general feature of any 3-dimensional ﬁnite Fermi system which exhibits an elastic

behavior. The twist mode is well known in atomic nuclei and still remains an actual topic

of both theoretical and experimental studies [41]-[44]. The interest on twist is motivated

by the fact that this mode is a remarkable example of an elastic vortex motion. The twist

was also predicted but not yet observed in atomic clusters [5, 43] and trapped dilute gas of

Fermi atoms [45].

Unlike the M1 scissor mode which exists only in deformed systems, the twist takes place

in Fermi systems of any shape, spherical and deformed. As the magnetic quadrupole mode,

the twist is represented by

where B(M2) is the probability of M2 transition from the ground state to 2− twist state. It
is easy to see that the generating operator of the twist, zLz ∝

which is the sum of spin and orbital contributions with gs = 2 and gl = 1. So, it is natural

to consider the twist as a part of the orbital M2 motion.

Let’s consider now the microscopic features of the twist. Figure 8 exhibits results of the

becomes the strongest multipole magnetic mode already for clusters of medium size. This

emphasizes its fundamental character.

The search for the twist in atomic clusters is a demanding problem. This mode cannot

be observed in photoabsorption (only dipole) or two-photon processes (only natural parity).

Exploration of twist in atomic nuclei hints that one might try to search this mode in clusters

by means of angular resolved electron-energy-loss-spectroscopy (EELS) [23, 47, 48]. Since

twist contributes to the transverse form-factor, the back angles of scattered electrons are

most suitable.

A. General view

III. EXPERIMENTAL ACCESS TO NON-DIPOLE MODES

As compared with other non-dipole modes, infrared quadrupole states deserve special

attention. There are at least two samples, i) free light deformed clusters and ii) oriented

silver rods embedded in a matrix, where these modes can be studied experimentally in

two-photon processes. The light deformed clusters are especially interesting [7] since their

quadrupole modes provide access to the single electron spectra. In turn, the spectra can

serve as a sensitive indicator of several cluster properties.

It is known that just small

clusters demonstrate properties unusual for the bulk and, in this sense, are attractive for

both fundamental physics and applications.

19

Two-photon processes (TPP) are widely used in atomic and molecular physics (for a

comprehensive discussion see [52]). Since atomic clusters are similar to molecules, it would

be natural to implement the same reactions to clusters. However, applications of TPP

to clusters are still very scarce. This can be partly explained by our poor knowledge on

non-dipole low-energy electron modes in clusters, and partly by peculiarities of clusters.

In this section we discuss applicability of some traditional TPP methods to clusters

with particular emphasis on infrared quadrupole modes. In this connection, some cluster

properties essential for TPP should be closely scrutinized. Namely:

i) The dominant decay channel of cluster levels is usually not radiative. The collective

states, like the dipole plasmon, mainly decay through Landau fragmentation (dissipation of

the collective motion through surrounding 1eh excitations). For non-collective states, the

electron-electron collisions and electron-ion coupling are most essential.

ii) Collective electron modes in clusters have very short lifetimes. The typical example is

the dipole plasmon which represents in medium large clusters with Ne ∼
(
∼

0.5-1 eV) mode with a life time of 10-20 fs. This is due to a coupling of the collec-

1000 a broad

50

−

tive strength with energetically close 1eh states whose availability increases with increasing

cluster size [49, 50]. The mechanism is similar to Landau damping of the plasmon in the

bulk electron gas [51]. Its analogue in ﬁnite systems is called therefore Landau fragmen-

tation. The short lifetimes hamper application of adiabatic TPP methods as they would

require more intense laser irradiation. The intense irradiation results in strong dynamical

Stark shifts and undesirable population of high-energy states by second harmonic of the laser

pulses. These eﬀects can be detrimental for adiabatic TPP especially if the cluster spec-

trum is not suﬃciently dilute. Non-collective electron modes (as low-lying quadrupole 1eh

ones) have much longer life times that can approach ps for low temperature and hundreds

fs for the room temperature [12, 13]. Unlike molecules, these modes in metal clusters are

mainly driven by the mean ﬁeld similar to the nuclear one. This allows their unambiguous

treatment at least in light clusters with 5-20 atoms.

iii) Clusters exhibit a strong shape isomerism. Even beams with size selected clusters

usually represent a statistical mix of samples with a multitude of diﬀerent shapes. This

blurs the measured low-energy electron spectra.

The properties i)-iii) are absent in atoms but at least some of them are common for

molecules. Thus one may hope that methods of molecular spectroscopy can be applied

to clusters.

It is worth noting that, as compared with molecules, clusters provide new

possibilities for investigation of electron modes. The electron spectra in clusters are very

diverse (from the collective plasmons to the pure 1eh conﬁgurations) and, at the same time,

are easily classiﬁed and treated in terms of electronic quantum shells.

Light free clusters with 5-20 atoms have dilute spectra, a feature which allows to avoid

some of the troubles listed above. Landau fragmentation in such clusters is very weak, the

infrared levels are not so broad and their lifetimes are much longer. Most of light clusters

have larger isomer energies such that they have one clearly preferred equilibrium shape and

many of the energetically close isomeric shapes are similar to the ground state one [22], thus

minimizing blurring of the low-energy spectra. Beams of size-selected singly-charged light

clusters are readily available. The cluster temperature

100-200 K could be optimal for

∼

our aims. Then the thermal broadening of electron levels is small.

Oriented silver rods embedded into glass [8, 9] represent another interesting sample to

be studied in TPP. These clusters are known as commercial polarizers. The polarization is

provided by the property of the λµ = 10 branch of the dipole plasmon to absorb only the

light aligned along the symmetry axis of the cluster. Because of the big axis ratio, the rods

represent an example of atomic clusters with an extreme deformation. These heavy clusters

can be studied in Raman scattering [10].

Following the general TPP scheme presented in Fig. 10, the target quadrupole level is

populated via an intermediate dipole state by two (absorption and emission) dipole transi-

tions. Both the collective dipole plasmon and non-collective 1eh conﬁgurations can serve as

intermediate states. The TPP via the dipole plasmon, with its broad and smoothed structure

and ultra-fast decay through Landau damping, reminds the population transfer via contin-

uum. The TPP via non-collective 1eh dipole states is more transparent and represents the

typical population transfer process in tree-bound-state Λ-systems.

As is shown in Fig. 10, there are possible TPP paths via dipole states with λµ = 10 and

11. These states could be, for instance, branches of the dipole plasmon, separated by the

deformation splitting. In the ﬁrst case, the population of λµ =22 mode is forbidden and

only 20 and 21 modes can be targeted. This provides some selection when carrying out TPP

experiments.

For a crude analysis of TPP in clusters, one may use the rotating wave approximation

(RWA) that allows to discard the fast laser frequencies and treat the problem with the

much lower Rabi frequencies only. Fig. 11 for Na+

11 shows a typical electron Λ-system

and hence the scale of the laser frequencies corresponding to photoabsorption (pump) and

photoemission (Stokes) processes. Following our calculations, even for laser pulses with

intensity I

∼
interval 10−1

−

1010W/cm2, Rabi frequencies in light deformed sodium clusters lie in the

10−2 eV. Obviously, they are much less than the carrier (laser) frequencies

and thus fulﬁll the main RWA requirement. Besides, because of the pretty long life-time of

the target non-collective quadrupole states, one may operate with long laser pulses covering

many Rabi cycles. Hence we match the second RWA requirement.

In the next subsections, we will consider some widespread two-photon processes (Raman

Scattering (RS), Stimulated Emission Pumping (SEP), and Stimulated Raman Adiabatic

22

D
Passage (STIRAP)) and estimate their ability to observe infrared quadrupole modes.

B. Raman scattering

RS is one of the simplest two-photon processes where a dipole laser-induced transition

to an intermediate electronic level (real or virtual) is followed by the dipole spontaneous

ﬂuorescence to low-energy levels.

RS measurements of electron infrared modes in clusters are yet very rare. For instance, the

quadrupole infrared modes were observed in heavy silver clusters embedded into amorphous

silica ﬁlms [31]. The dipole plasmon was used as a resonant intermediate state.

In the

recent experiment of this group with another sample (oriented silver rods embedded into

glass), the infrared electron quadrupole mode, probably λµ = 20, was detected [10]. These

observations show that the dipole plasmon can be used as intermediate state for TPP in spite

of its extremely short lifetime. This is the encouraging message for TPP implementation to

clusters.

RS generally assumes that the coupling between the intermediate dipole and target

quadrupole states, from one side, and the coupling between the intermediate and ground

states, from the other side, are of the same order of magnitude. Only then the ﬁnal state is

successfully populated. This means that the absorption and emission dipole matrix elements

should be of the same scale. Experiments of E. Duval [10, 31] show that this is indeed the

case for heavy clusters. In light deformed clusters the situation is more complicated. Our

calculations [7] for Na+

7 , Na+

11 and Na+

15 revealed that the absorption and emission dipole

matrix elements lie mainly in the interval 2-10 ea0 (atomic units) and thus are basically sim-

ilar. This means that infrared quadrupole modes in light deformed clusters have a chance

to be observed in the resonant RS running via the dipole plasmon. However, we have also

found a few exceptions when the Stokes couplings are strongly suppressed due to destruc-
tive interference eﬀects (see discussion in [7]). The particular example is oblate Na+

7 where

only the path via the λµ = 11 branch of dipole plasmon results in a strong TPP while the

alternative path via the λµ = 10 branch is about completely suppressed. Such considerable

variations for diﬀerent paths are not surprising for small clusters where electronic spectra

and transition rates are very speciﬁc and can appreciably change from one sample to an-

other. In clusters with suppressed dipole couplings, the RS is not eﬀective. Besides, the RS

23

has a general drawback that its photoemission step is fully dictated by competition between

diﬀerent decay channels of the intermediate state. As a result, the spontaneous ﬂuorescence

to the target state and hence the RS eﬃciency is typically rather low. To overcome this

trouble, we should consider methods with stimulated emission into the target level.

C. Stimulated emission pumping

The stimulated emission pumping (SEP) enjoys widespread application for atoms and

molecules and seems to be very promising for population of infrared quadrupole states in

clusters. Unlike RS, this method exploits two lasers, pump and Stokes (or dump) [53, 56].

The pump pulse is responsible for the ﬁrst photoabsorption step. The Stokes pulse couples

the intermediate state to the target one. The pulses can be simultaneous or sequential. If

the diﬀerence between the pump and Stokes frequencies is in resonance with the frequency

of the target state, then the Stokes radiation stimulates emission to this state.

One should distinguish SEP with incoherent and coherent irradiation. If incoherent light

sources are used, then, even in the best case of the saturated process and coincident pump

and Stokes pulses, the maximal SEP eﬃciency achieves only one-third of the complete

population [56]. In practice, the transfer eﬃciency does not exceed 10%. However, even this

value is enough for many spectroscopic studies.

A much better population can be achieved for coherent laser irradiation. If the pump

and Stokes pulses coincide, then under certain requirements (given in the next subsection)

we can even gain the fully adiabatic process (with still not complete population transfer as

compared with STIRAP [57]). In this subsection, we consider the coherent SEP with an

appreciable detuning (often called as oﬀ-resonant stimulated Raman). This process promises

a simple, robust and eﬃcient population scheme.

We present below our TDLDA results for SEP in Na+

11. The calculations explore the

time evolution of the initial single-electron states. All the possible channels including pho-

toionization (through absorbing boundary conditions) are taken into account. The ions

are considered in soft jellium approximation at ﬁxed deformation. The details of the

method are described elsewhere [12, 13]. The parameters of the Stokes and pump pulses

are given the panel (c). Their frequencies maintain the two-photon resonance with the tar-
get state: ωp −

ωs = ω2+0 and are detuned somewhat below the intermediate dipole state,

Bohr atomic unit) are very endurant. There is no any attenuation until 800 fs. Our study

shows that the lifetime of this mode is even longer and achieves at least a few ps. Because of

the dilute spectrum, decay of this mode via the electron-electron coupling is negligible. Only

the coupling with the ions remains but it is not taken into account in these calculations.

The electron-ion coupling should limit lifetime of the mode by a few hundred fs at a room

temperature and by a few ps at a minimal temperature

10 K. The latter case corresponds

∼

to our analysis.

The calculations show that the endurant quadrupole mode is also produced in TPP

running through the dipole plasmon. In this case, the mode is even several times stronger.

The pulses with the frequencies ωP =2.04 eV and ωP =1.24 eV and the same intensities and

durations as in Fig. 12 were used. The pulses were appreciably detuned from the dipole

plasmon so as to weaken the competing channels (compare ωP =2.04 eV with the dipole
plasmon in Na+

11 depicted in Fig. 1). It is remarkable that the dipole plasmon can be used as

26

the eﬀective mediator in spite of its extremely short lifetime. The key point is the detuning

that prevents the population of the plasmon and thus the leaking from it. Using the dipole

plasmon as the intermediate state has the additional advantage of dealing with the well

know structure rather than with still poorly known low-energy dipole states.

Fig. 13 demonstrates the dependence of the quadrupole signal on the sequence of the

pump and Stokes pulses.

It seen that the quadrupole mode is maximal at simultaneous

pulses. This is the typical SEP case. The process is rather robust to changes of pulse

characteristics. The calculations show that variations by several times in pulse durations

and intensities still maintain the stable and distinctive SEP (though with the rescaled mode

amplitude). Of course, any change in the pulse intensities should be compensated by the

corresponding modiﬁcation of the detuning.

It is a non-trivial problem to detect the quadrupole mode populated in SEP. In principle,

this could be done by using the probe laser with supplemented PES (photoelectron spectra)

spectroscopy. The probe laser should be intense enough to result in measurable PES and its

frequency should be large to map the single-electron states in the cluster and thus provide

the complete PES [58].

In Na+

11, it could be ωprobe ∼

7 - 8 eV. The probe pulse should

follow the pump one with a considerable delay so as to avoid overlapping with the latter and

map only the endurant quadrupole mode. Due to the Raman coupling of the single-electron

PES with the quadrupole oscillation, every PES should acquire left and right satellites with

the relative frequencies coinciding with ω2+. Hence we get the frequency of the quadrupole

state. The strategy is to keep the ﬁxed pump frequency with a reasonable detuning bellow

the intermediate dipole state and scan the Stokes frequency. When we get the resonance
satellites ωP −
detected.

ωS = ω2+, then the endurant quadrupole mode has to be produced and

It may happen that the Stokes frequency maps a dipole state.

In that case

the endurant dipole oscillation are accompanied by a subsequent considerable increase of

photoemission yield together with the appearance of dipole satellites. Such cases can be

easily separated from the case of interest, population of the quadrupole mode, since the

latter is not associated with a signiﬁcant resonant increase in photoemission yield but only

by the satellites signature alone.

The SEP experiments usually need three lasers: pump, Stokes and probe. However,

one may propose the simpler recipe with implementation of only pump and probe lasers.

Such scheme assumes the combination of the direct two-photon excitation of the quadrupole

27

state and PES techniques. Speciﬁcally, the intense pump laser should scan until its two

photons excite the quadrupole state. Then the delayed probe laser is applied in the manner

described above to detect the population. The calculations show that this simple method is

quite eﬀective and robust.

D. STIRAP

The STIRAP method [54, 55, 56] promises up to 100% population transfer from the initial

to the target level. This high eﬃciency is achieved by the coherent adiabatic character of the

process and the principle possibility to avoid any leaking from the intermediate levels. Like

SEP, STIRAP also implements pump and Stokes lasers providing the couplings

Its main requirements are:

ii) Counterintuitive sequence of partly overlapped pulses when the Stokes pulse comes

before the pump one.

iii) Adiabatic passage of the state vector from the initial to the target state. The adia-

baticity condition (for the detuning ∆=0) has the form

Ω∆τ >> 1

(16)

where Ω =

Ω2

p + Ω2

s is the average of the pump and Stokes Rabi frequencies and ∆τ is the

overlapping time of the pulses (duration of the evolution process).

Under these requirements, one of the adiabatic time-dependent eigen-functions of the

system becomes a superposition of the initial and target bare states only:

Following our calculations, the coupling dipole matrix element in light clusters is d

Rabi frequency as Ω

0.02 - 0.1 fs or ~Ω

0.01 - 0.07 eV. These values are less than the

∼

∼

detuning ∆=0.136 eV used for the SEP analysis in the previous subsection. Thus the SEP

was obtained at the tail of the dipole coupling between the states of the Λ-system. Under

the given detuning and laser intensity, the Stokes shift is S

0.0004 - 0.01 eV which is still

a bearable value.

Counterintuitive order of pump and Stokes pulses. The order when Stokes pulse precedes

the pump one is crucial for the complete population since only then the state vector can be

fully projected into the dark adiabatic state

b0(t) > [54, 55]. Stokes and pump pulses must

|
overlap and the overlapping time ∆τ determines the duration of the adiabatic evolution.

The ∆τ should not be longer than the lifetimes of the initial and target states while

the lifetime of the intermediate state does not matter if this state is not populated. So, the

ultra-short lifetime of the dipole plasmon (10-20 fs) is not the problem for the ideal STIRAP.

Even under some leaking from the plasmon (and thus the modest coupling of the dark state

29

b0(t) > with

1 >) STIRAP is still possible. This is partly conﬁrmed by recent experiment

|
[59] where STIRAP was induced via continuum. Even in this extreme case with ultra-fast

|

decay channels and considerable leaking, a clear STIRAP population transfer was obtained

(though with low eﬃciency

6%).

∼

When STIRAP runs via an isolated non-collective dipole state, like that with ω = 0.80

eV in Na+

11, then the situation is much simpler. Following the estimations for the lifetimes

of 1eh state, the value of ∆τ should not exceed a few hundreds fs at room temperature and

a few ps at low temperature.

It should be emphasized that the maximal population transfer at the counterintuitive

order of pump and Stokes pulses is the main signature of STIRAP. Just this feature allows

ﬁnally to judge if we deal with STIRAP or other processes like SEP.

Adiabatic passage. This requirement is crucial for STIRAP. Only adiabatic evolution can

ensure the steady complete populations. The adiabaticity condition is given by Eq. (16). If

we put, following the above estimations, Ω

see that the adiabaticity condition is fulﬁlled: Ω∆τ

0.02

0.1f s and ∆τ

300f s, then it is easy to

6

30 >> 1. However, the situation

∼

−

is not so simple since Eq.

(16) does not take into account the detuning that eﬀectively

weakens the Rabi frequency. In practice, we should use an appreciable detuning to minimize

the competing channels. But then Ω is considerably decreased and the adiabatic condition

is violated. This becomes a real hindrance when the electron spectrum is not dilute enough.

It worth noting that the adiabaticity condition (16) can be considerably relaxed. Indeed,

it was derived for one intermediate level. But the realistic spectrum of the dipole plasmon

consists of a broad structure consisting from a sequence of dipole levels (see Fig. 1). In

this case, the STIRAP adiabatic condition should be revised. The realistic case is more

complicated but, at the same time, opens new possibilities for STIRAP. In particular, one

may be allowed to loose the adiabatic STIRAP condition and thus the requirements for the

laser intensity.

A general case of N intermediate states, each with its own coupling and detuning was

studied in [60].

It was shown that the trapped adiabatic state

b0(t) > can be created

|

only when the ratio between each pump coupling and the respective Stokes coupling is the

same for all intermediate states. Following our calculations, this condition is unrealistic for

atomic clusters. However, softer alternative adiabatic requirements can be formulated. In

particular, in the general case of arbitrary couplings, one may tune the pump and Stokes

lasers just below all intermediate states and thus form so called adiabatic-transfer state which

also results in a high, although not complete, population of the target level. Unlike

b0(t) >,

the adiabatic-transfer state can have admixture from the intermediate states during the

evolution period ∆τ and so some population leaking is unavoidable. Nevertheless, we have

here a solid adiabatic transfer with a high population of the target state. Just this method

is implemented in our calculations while using the dipole plasmon as the intermediate TPP

state.

Altogether, the arguments and estimations presented above show that STIRAP is possible

in clusters. However, it is not so trivial to ﬁnd the optimal parameters of the process and

get STIRAP in realistic TDLDA calculations. Serious problems arise in connection with

dipole and quadrupole plasmons which reside in the energy region 2 - 4 eV and thus are

always covered by multiphoton excitations of the pump and Stokes pulses. Hence there

arises a considerable undesirable population leaking. Especially strong coupling with the

11. The up and low panels represent the quadrupole and dipole strengths

at diﬀerent delays (shifts) of the pump pulse versus the Stokes one: 82 fs (counterintuitive STIRAP

pulse sequence), 0 fs (coinciding pulses), -82 fs (intuitive pulse sequence). The parameters of the

Stokes (s) and and pump (p) pulses (frequency ω, duration T and intensity I) are given in the

low-right panel.

quadrupole plasmon takes place when the pump or Stokes frequencies are in resonance with

some dipole state. The example of such process is exhibited in Fig. 14 where the resonant

excitation of the dipole state at 1.38 eV leads to a huge population of the quadrupole

plasmon. This means that we should avoid the resonance cases by imposing appreciable

detuning. But, as was mentioned above, this will eﬀectively weaken the Rabi frequencies.

Then, to keep the requirement (16), one should use longer pulses. This is quite possible at

low temperatures when the lifetimes of the states can reach a few ps. In this case, we even

have the freedom to decrease the laser intensity with the aim to minimize the Stark shifts.

The proper choice of the pulse parameters allows to produce a STIRAP-like process

in clusters even at high laser intensity. A successful example is presented in Fig. 15.

A large detuning of ∆ = 0.15 eV is here combined with a high pulse intensity of I

∼
1011W/cm2. This particular choice allows to minimize the impact of the quadrupole and

32

w
I
dipole plasmons and, at the same time, to keep the adiabaticity condition. Fig. 15 shows

that the counterintuitive pulse sequence provides the stronger strength of the quadrupole

mode than the coinciding pulses. In terms of the population, this could be the unequivocal

signature of the STIRAP. As is seen from the ﬁgure, the intuitive pulse sequence also results

in the same quadrupole strength.

It looks like this TPP embraces not only the typical

STIRAP branch corresponding to the dark state

b0 > but also the branch from the dark

|

state

b+ >. The latter takes place because of the large detuning below the intermediate

|

dipole state. Folowing [61], an appreciable detuning below or above the intermediate state

results in the additional dark dressed state

b+ > or

b− >, respectively.

|

|

Though the process in Fig. 15 looks like STIRAP, its STIRAP nature still should be

proved. The point is that the strength exhibited in Fig. 15 does not correspond to the

population (squared amplitude of the target state) but rather to the coherence (product of

amplitudes of initial and target states). Hence, the maxima of the strength at non-zero pulse

shifts still do not mean that the similar maxima take place for the population of the target

state. Our TDLDA model does not allow to estimate properly the population. However, this

can be done within the Rotating Wave Approximation for 3-level Λ-system [56]. Following

these estimations, we have found that the TPP in the example above has the maximal

population at coinciding pulses and thus is not STIRAP. For getting the STIRAP we need

more intense laser pulses and maybe another value of the detuning. One may get other, and

more favorable, options in clusters by a more suitable choice of the process parameters, set

to worked out. In any case, the example in Fig. 15 hints the principle possibility of STIRAP

in atomic clusters. The experimental detection of the STIRAP population can be done by

the same methods as in SEP.

The application of STIRAP to clusters seems to be generally feasible. At the same time,

this process is more demanding to realize than SEP. It requires further studies within realistic

TDLDA models to look for the most eﬀective process conﬁgurations. STIRAP can hardly

be more practicable than SEP in population and detection of infrared quadrupole modes

in clusters. However, one may try to implement STIRAP to get more transfer eﬃciency in

particular cases. Besides, STIRAP running via the dipole plasmon can be interesting for

theory of adiabatic TPP as such. Indeed, the intermediate state like the dipole plasmon does

not exist in atoms and molecules and so was not yet investigated. Perhaps, this intermediate

state will oﬀer new options for STIRAP and extend our knowledge about this intriguing TPP.

IV. CONCLUSION

Non-dipole infrared electron modes in atomic clusters (electric quadrupole (E2), magnetic

dipole scissors (M1) and magnetic quadrupole twist (M2)) were analyzed theoretically using

as tool the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA). The collective and non-

collective nature of these modes as well as their connection with the basic cluster properties

(single electron spectra, orbital magnetism) were analyzed in detail. Free light deformed

sodium clusters and embedded oriented silver rods were considered as the most promising

samples. The possible routes of experimental observation of infrared quadrupole modes in

two-photon processes (Raman scattering, stimulated emission pumping (SEP) and stimu-

lated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)) were scrutinized. Following our analysis, the

combination of SEP and PES techniques provides probably the most simple and robust way

to populate and detect the infrared quadrupole states in free light deformed clusters. As

a complementary method, a technique using direct two-photon excitation was also consid-

ered. The Raman scattering seems to be optimal for large clusters, especially embedded

oriented silver rods. The calculations encourage applicability of STIRAP to clusters. How-

ever, this intriguing but demanding method still needs further realistic TDLDA studies.
Smaller clusters as, e.g., Na+

7 are the most promising candidates.

We hope that our study will stimulate investigation of non-dipole electron modes in

clusters by means of TPP experimental methods. This would provide a deeper understanding

both clusters properties and peculiarities of diﬀerent TPP schemes.

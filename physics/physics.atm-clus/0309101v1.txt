Abstract

We present a systematic study of the geometry, energetics, electronic

structure and bonding in various Al-Li clusters viz. AlnLin (n=1-11), Al−
2 ,

Al2−

2 , Al2Li, Al2Li−, and Al6Li8 using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynam-

ics method within the framework of density functional theory. The growth

patterns in these cluster are found to be divided in two broad categories: the

ﬁrst consisting of a quinted roof of Al2Li2 (n=2-4) and the second consisting

of a pentagonal ring (n=7-9). A covalent bonding between Al-Li in Al2Li2 is

seen, whereas, in larger clusters, it is ionic. A three dimensional growth of the

Al cluster in Al2−

4 , Al5Li5, and Al6Li8 leads to a transition from localized to

delocalized bonding. In clusters with more than six Al atoms, the eigenvalue

spectrum is divided into two groups: a lower group of jellium-like states and a

higher group of localized bonds arising out of p complex. Thus, a mixture of

localized, delocalized, and ionic bonding is seen in these clusters. Finally, we

have discussed the tetravalent behavior of Al atoms arising due to a charge

1

transfer from the Li atoms to the Al atoms.

I. INTRODUCTION

The discovery of C60 buckminsterfullerene [1], observation of magicity in metallic clus-

ters [2], unusual thermodynamical properties of clusters like Na [3], Sn [4] etc., has given

rise to an explosive growth of research in the ﬁeld of cluster physics. Extensive theoretical

and experimental [5–7] work has been carried out to understand the physical and chemical

properties of clusters like size-evolutionary pattern in cluster geometry, thermodynamics,

vibrational and rotational properties, optical properties, electronic structure, and bonding,

chemical reactivity, as well as the emergence of the bulk properties with the increase in

cluster size.

Recently observed aromaticity [8] and antiaromaticity [9–12] in inorganic molecules, and

in particular Al-Li clusters, has stimulated further research in these systems. These prop-

erties are well-known and important in organic chemistry [13]. However, recently the ﬁrst

experimental and theoretical evidence of aromaticity in all-metal system viz. Al2−

4 and MAl−
4

(M = Li, Na, Cu) was reported by Wang and coworkers [8]. They found the Al2−

4 dian-

ion to be square-planar possessing 2 − π electrons, thus conforming the structural criterion

for aromaticity. The concept of antiaromaticity, introduced by Breslow [14] et al., corre-

sponds to the destabilization seen in the cyclic systems with 4n − π electrons. Although,

such molecules do not occur outside of organic chemistry, the ﬁrst all-metal antiaromatic

compound viz., Al4Li4 was theoretically reported by Shetty [9,11] et al. and others [12].

Aluminum-lithium clusters, which we study in this paper, are also interesting due to

their unusual structural and bonding properties that are quite diﬀerent from those of the

pure clusters of the constituent elements. Both pure Al and Li clusters have been extensively

studied using the spherical jellium model (SJM) [2]. However, it is observed that although

the SJM has been quite successful in describing the gross electronic structure and the sta-

bility of alkali metal atom clusters [2,15], the Al clusters present an interesting contrast.

Rao and Jena [16] have done a comprehensive study of the aluminum cluster using ab initio

density functional theory. They found that in small Al clusters, the eﬀective valency of

3

Al is one [16] due to a large energy gap of about 5eV separating the 3s2 and 3p1 orbitals.

However, Rao [17] et al. as well as Dhavale [18] et al. did not ﬁnd any signature of such

monovalent behavior, contrary to the expectations. Investigation by Cheng [19] et al. shows

that a single Al atom in Li clusters introduces a localized bond between the Al impurity

and the Li host. They also found a magic cluster AlLi5, and suggested that AlnLi5n can

aggregate at least for some values of n ≥ 2 and may exhibit properties characteristic to an

assembly of such clusters from the AlLi5 subunits. Akola [20] et al., however, found that this

idea does not apply after n = 2. Further, their investigation on bonding in a Li-rich Al-Li

cluster shows a substantial charge transfer from Li atom and nearby Al atom, strengthening

the ionic Al-Li bond, while the Al-Al bond gained a more covalent nature. Such charge

transfer has been observed by Kumar [21] in several mixed Al-Li clusters. He found a lay-

ered Al10Li8 compound to be magic with electronic and geometric shell closing. This was

the ﬁrst instance where a shell closure in s − p bonded metal cluster was found to occur at

38 valence electrons. Note that the magic numbers for alkali metal atom clusters [2] are 2,

8, 18, 20, 40,..., whereas, some of the magic Al clusters are Al+

7 , Al−

7 , Al−

11, Al−

13, etc [16,22].

The Al-Li bulk is especially interesting due to the fact that it forms a stable alloy at

over the wide range of concentration. However, the most stable intermetallic B32 phase

corresponds to the 50:50 concentration [23]. In this B32 phase, a mixture of covalent and

ionic bonding is seen due to a remarkable charge transfer from the Li atoms to the Al atoms.

Moreover, the close resemblance of the density of states (DOS) (without any band gap) [24] to

that of the covalently bonded diamond structure indicates a tetravalent behavior of Al atom.

Thus, based on these observations, one can expect that the behavior of Al in AlnLin clusters

would be similar to that of the tetravalent atom Si [25], Ge [26], Sn, and Pb [27]. Indeed, our

present work shows that in certain clusters, structure and bonding of Aln is similar to that

of the group IV A clusters. Moreover, earlier work on the heterogeneous Al-Li clusters has

focussed on speciﬁc aspects like systematics in the geometry, stability, shell closure, magic

behavior etc. Bonding in such clusters was discussed on the basis of total charge density

as well as the diﬀerence of the self-consistent charge density, ρscf , and the superimposed

4

atomic charge densities ρsuperimposed of the constituent atoms. On the contrary, analysis

of the molecular orbitals (MOs) has revealed some unusual properties like aromaticity and

antiaromaticity in all-metal Al-Li clusters. In our earlier work, we have examined some of the

issues concerning the geometry and the stability of various Al-Li clusters viz. AlnLin (n =,

1-10, 13) [28], AlnLi7 (n=1-7) [29], AlLin (n=1,8) [29] and Al13Lin (n=1-4,10,19,20,21) [30].

We have found that the geometry of these clusters was dictated by the geometry of the

core Al cluster enclosed in the Li cage. On account of these calculations being performed

by the density based molecular dynamics (DBMD) method, with the approximate kinetic

energy functional, an analysis of the bonding and electronic structure was not possible. In

the present work, we study the systematics of the geometry, energetics, electronic structure

and the bonding properties in various Al-Li clusters viz. AlnLin (n=1-11), Al−

2 , Al2−

2 , Al2Li,

Al2Li−, and Al6Li8 using Kohn-Sham formulation of the density functional theory (DFT)

within the pseudopotential and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The bonding

in these clusters is discussed via the electron localization function (ELF) [31] as well as the

behavior of the occupied molecular orbitals. We ﬁnd that as the clusters grow, although the

bond between Al-Al in all these clusters is predominantly covalent, an eﬀective delocalization

of the charge density is seen. Moreover, the eigenvalue spectrum of the clusters with more

than six Al atoms can be separated into lower jellium-like and higher localized orbitals. In

section II we shall describe the computational details, followed by a discussion of the results

in section III.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

The ground state geometry as well as other low-lying structures was obtained in two

stages.

In the ﬁrst stage, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) [32] based

on Kohn-Sham (KS) [33] formulation of density functional theory (DFT) was employed.

The computer code used for this purpose was developed in our own group. The total en-

ergy during each of the molecular dynamics step was minimized using damped equation

5

of motion [34]. The calculations were performed using norm-conserving pseudopotentials of

Bachelet [35] et al., in the Kleinman-Bylander [36] form with s part treated as nonlocal. The

exchange-correlation potential was calculated using the local density approximation (LDA)

given by Ceperley-Alder [37]. A cubic supercell of 40a.u. with an energy cutoﬀ of 17 Ry

was used.

The damped equation of motion scheme [34] permits use of a fairly moderate time step

≈100a.u. Starting from a random conﬁguration, the AlnLin clusters were heated to 1400-

1700K, and allowed to span the phase space for a few thousand iterations. In our previous

investigations [28–30] on AlnLin clusters, it was found that the Li atoms segregate at the

surface with the Al atoms forming an inner core. In order to avoid any such segregation

during the molecular dynamics run, we have interchanged the Al and the Li atoms. This

has ensured that the cluster visits all its local minima as well as the global minimum. At

the end of each ionic displacement, the norm of the eigenstates deﬁned as | hψi − ǫiψi |2

(where ǫi is an eigenvalue corresponding to eigenstate ψi of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian h)

was within the range of 10−4 − 10−7a.u.

In the second stage, various low-lying structures were obtained by conjugate gradient

and/or steepest descent [32] method starting from various suitable conﬁgurations during

the molecular dynamics run. This was done using the ultrasoft pseudopotentials [38] within

the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) implemented in the VASP [39] package. The

Perdew-Wang [40] exchange-correlation potential for GGA has been used. The size of the

simulation cell was varied according to the cluster studied (see Table-I).

The geometries were optimized with a kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 11.87 Ry The structures

were considered to have converged when the forces on each ion was less than 0.01eV/˚A with

a convergence in the total energy within the range of 10−4 − 10−6eV. In general, we ﬁnd that

there are many isomeric structures nearly degenerate to the lowest energy state. Few of the

structures can be obtained by interchanging the Al and the Li atoms or by rearranging the

position of Li atoms. In the present work, we discuss only the lowest few geometries.

The nature of the bonding has been investigated using the electron localization function

(ELF) [31] along with the molecular orbitals (MO). Such ELF have been found to be useful

for elucidating the bonding characteristics of a variety of systems, especially in conjunction

with the charge density. The value of the ELF lies between 0 and 1, where 1 represents a

perfect localization of the valence charge density.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Structure, energetics and stability

The ground state geometries of AlnLin clusters can be grouped into two broad categories,

for n = 2−4 and n = 7−9, depending on the growth pattern. In the ﬁrst category a quinted

roof-like structure of Al2Li2 is seen. The second category shows a pentagonal ring which

is a signature of a icosahedral growth. The ground state geometries of n = 5, 6, and 10

7

clusters show neither the quinted roof nor a pentagonal ring. In what follows, we discuss the

structure and stability of these clusters. The stability is discussed via the binding energy

(Eb), the dissociation energy (∆E) and the second diﬀerence in the total energy with respect

to a single Al-Li pair (∆2E), and the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular

orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (ﬁgure 2). These

quantities are deﬁned as:

Eb[AlnLin] = −E[AlnLin] + n (E[Al] + E[Li])

∆E[AlnLin] = E[Al Li] + (E[AlnLin] − E[Aln−1Lin−1])

∆2E[AlnLin] = E[Aln+1Lin+1] + E[Aln−1Lin−1] − 2E[AlnLin]

The ground state geometry of Al2Li2 is a quinted roof (ﬁgure 1a(i)). This cluster is one

of the most stable clusters of AlnLin. The planar geometry (ﬁgure 1a(ii)) is the low-lying

structure of the Al2Li2. Such planar structure, with some bending has been observed by

Kumar [21] in the magic cluster Al10Li8. He found that in spite of having 8 valence electrons,

the planar structure does not show any magical behavior. However, his search was restricted

to just one structure, whereas, we have found a diﬀerent geometry to be the lowest energy

structure of Al2Li2. Our investigation shows that the quinted roof of Al2Li2 does exhibit

some magical behavior. A substantial rise in the binding energy (ﬁgure 2a) is seen when

two Al-Li dimers combine to form Al2Li2 cluster. Moreover, a peak in the dissociation

energy (∆E) (ﬁgure 2b), a minima in the second diﬀerence in energy (∆2E) (ﬁgure 2c)

and a large HOMO-LUMO gap (ﬁgure 2d) also signiﬁes a relatively high stability of this

cluster. A similar quinted roof structure is also seen in the ground state structure of the

clusters Al3Li3 and Al4Li4. However, the Al3Li3 is not energetically as stable as Al2Li2 (see

ﬁgure 1b(i)). The lowest energy structure of Al4Li4 shows two units of Al2Li2 (ﬁgure 1c(i)).

These two units are arranged such that an Al4 rectangle is formed. This rectangular shape

gives rise to an antiaromatic nature in this cluster [9,12]. This structure has been extensively

studied by us [9,11,41] and others [12]. The two low-lying structures of Al4Li4 (ﬁgure 1c(ii)

and 1c(iii)) show a square-plane and a quinted roof of four Al atoms, respectively.

8

In Al5Li5 cluster, a square-plane of Al4 is seen, with the ﬁfth Al atom capping this

plane (ﬁgure 1d). Such square-planar geometry of Al4 was also observed in the all-metal

aromatic compounds Al2−

4 and MAl−

4 (M = Li, Na, and Cu) [8]. Al5Li5 shows the ﬁrst three

dimensional structure of Aln in AlnLin clusters. Recall that the appearance of such three

dimensional geometry in pure Al clusters [16] is seen for Al6. The Al5Li5 cluster is the most

stable among the clusters studied. This is clear from the binding energy, ∆E, ∆2E, and the

HOMO-LUMO gap plots shown in ﬁgure 2a-2c, respectively. An interesting aspect of the

Al5Li5 cluster is the formation of a plane composed of four Li atoms with one Al atom at

the center, akin to the face of a fcc cell. A similar structure for Al5Na5 was predicted by

Dhavale [18] et al. A complete fcc structure can be formed by fourteen atoms: six Al atoms at

the face centered sites and eight Li atoms at the vertices of the cube. Such structure is shown

in ﬁgure 1e(i). This structure was ﬁrst studied by Shah [28] et al. using DBMD. They found

this structure to be the lowest energy structure of Al6Li8. We have also studied this structure

by employing KS-BOMD method. We ﬁnd that this fcc structure, with slight distortion, is

1.11eV higher than that the most stable structure of Al6Li8, shown in ﬁgure 1e(ii). It can be

noted that the fcc structure and the lowest energy structure of Al6Li8 are nearly similar, the

main diﬀerence being the elongation of one of the Al4 square-planes in the fcc structure into

a rectangle. It is interesting to note that the series Al2−

4 , Li-Al−

4 , Al5Li5, and Al6Li8 shows

a three dimensional octahedral growth of Al cluster surrounded by Li atoms. This results

in an eﬀective delocalization of the electron density (see section III B). The Al6Li6 cluster

also shows a geometry similar to that of Al5Li5, with distortions in the Al4 square-plane

(ﬁgure 3a(i)). In the ﬁrst low energy structure (ﬁgure 3a(ii)), a tetrahedra of Al4 is seen,

while the other low lying structure shows an octahedra of Al6. The octahedral structure is

the ground state geometry of the six atom pure Al cluster [16].

The appearance of a pentagonal ring, which is a precursor to the icosahedral growth, is

seen for n = 7 (Al13 is a distorted icosahedra in its ground state [42]). The ground state

geometry of Al7Li7 shows a pentagonal bipyramid of Al7 which is capped by the Li atoms

(ﬁgure 3b(i)). Appearance of a similar pentagonal ring in pure Al clusters (in neutral as

9

well as singly charged form) is seen for Al9 [16] as well as in tetravalent atom clusters viz.

Sn, and Pb [27] for seven atom clusters. Incidentally, these clusters are isoelectronic similar

to Al7Li7 with 28 valence electrons. The low energy structure of Al7Li7 (ﬁgure 3b(ii)) also

shows a pentagonal ring. The ground state geometry of n = 8, 9, and 11 clusters (ﬁgure 3c(i),

4a(i) and 4c(i), respectively) also shows such pentagonal rings. However, the lowest energy

structure of Al10Li10 cluster (ﬁgure 4b(i)) is completely diﬀerent from that of the Al7Li7 to

Al9Li9 and Al11Li11, in that no signature of the pentagonal ring is seen. In fact, the geometry

is similar to that of Sn10 i.e. a tetracapped trigonal prism (TTP) [43] with some distortions.

This TTP structure is enclosed in a Li cage resulting in its distortion. It also shows magical

behavior, since, it exhibits a peak in the dissociation energy (∆E), a minima in the second

diﬀerence in energy (∆2E), and a large HOMO-LUMO gap (ﬁgure 2a-2c, respectively).

We have done an analysis of the interatomic bond distances in order to understand the

mixing and segregation behavior of the Al and the Li atoms.

In ﬁgure 2d, we plot the

minimum interatomic bond distances for Al-Al, Al-Li and Li-Li. We ﬁnd that in smaller

clusters (n ≤ 4) the Al-Al bond is dominant. However, from n = 5 onwards, the Al-Li

distance is comparable to the Al-Al bond distances. Recall that at n = 5, the ﬁrst three

dimensional Aln structure emerges, thereby increasing the surface area. This helps the Li

atoms to maximize the Al-Li bonds and thereby move closer to the Al atoms.

It is well known that the density based method is not as accurate as the Kohn-Sham

method, nonetheless, it has been extensively used to investigate the geometry, and stability

of various Al-Li clusters [28–30]. Here, we make some pertinent comments on the diﬀerence

in the geometry of the AlnLin clusters obtained by these two methods. Our results show that

the geometries of some clusters were well predicted by DBMD. For instance, the structure

of Al2Li2 was found to be a quinted roof by both the methods (see ref. 28 for DBMD

results). Geometries of other clusters like Al7Li7 to Al9Li9 show some substitutional disorder.

However, there are certain clusters where the geometries were quite diﬀerent by the KS

method. For example, the structures of, Al3Li3, predicted by DBMD, is a capped trigonal

bipyramid [28]. When optimized by KS, this structure gets Jahn-Teller distorted into a

10

structure with a quinted roof of Al2Li2. The evolution in the geometry by DBMD method

shows an earlier appearance of three dimensional structure of Aln at n = 4 (Al4 is tetrahedra

in Al4Li4), as compared to the capped square of Al5 in Al5Li5 by KS method.

B. Bonding

1. Al2Li2

As noted above, Al2Li2 is one of the most stable clusters. This cluster has 8 valence

electrons, which corresponds to a closed shell in the jellium sense. However, the behavior of

the MOs as well as the eigenvalue spectrum does not resemble that of the SJM. Kumar [21]

found that the bonding between Al-Li in the planar Al2Li2 structure (ﬁgure 1a(ii)) is ionic.

On the contrary, our investigation shows a covalent bond between Al2 and the Li atoms,

in addition to the covalent bond between Al-Al.

In order to get a better insight of the

bonding in Al2Li2, we have studied various clusters viz. Al2, Al−

2 , Al2−

2 , Al2Li, Al2Li−,

and Al2Li2. This series represents a growth of Al2Li2 from the Al2 dimer. In ﬁgure 5, we

show the eigenvalue spectrum, binding energy per atom, and the Al-Al bond distance for

the optimized geometries of these clusters. The eigenvalue spectrum of Al2 shows a triply

degenerate HOMO state. These states are partially ﬁlled two π and one σ bond (ﬁgure not

shown). Addition of a Li atom splits the HOMO state (ﬁgure 5a) forming a σ bond with

the py − py π orbital of the Al2 dimer (isodensity surfaces not shown). This also introduces

a small HOMO-LUMO gap of about 0.15eV. The second Li atom further splits the HOMO

state introducing a substantial gap of 0.68eV. However, in this case, the two Li atoms form

a dimer, which is then covalently bonded to the Al2 dimer. These covalent bonds are shown

in ﬁgure 6. Moreover, a charge transfer from the Li atoms to the bonding region between

the Al and Li takes place (ﬁgure not shown). This further strengthens the covalent bond

between them.

In order to form ionic bond between Al and Li, a charge transfer from Li atom to Al

11

atom should take place. This would lead to a net negative charge on the Al2 dimer and

enhance its stability. The binding energy (ﬁgure 5b) of the negatively charged clusters viz.

Al−

2 , Al2−

2 , and Al2Li−, does show an increase over that of the corresponding neutral clusters.

However, their HOMO state are multiply degenerate and partially ﬁlled orbitals (ﬁgure 5a).

Morever, a contraction of the Al-Al bond upon addition of an electron or a Li atom is seen,

the contraction on addition of a Li atom being more than that due to the addition of an

electron. Thus, a charge transfer is not prefered in this system.

2. Al4Li4

The bonding in Al4Li4 cluster has been extensively studied by us [9,11,41] and oth-

ers [12]. This cluster has been found to be antiaromatic with 4 − π electrons. For the sake

of completeness, we discuss the bonding of this cluster. This cluster, as discussed earlier, is

composed of two Al2Li2 units arranged edge-to-edge to form a Al4 rectangle. This rectan-

gular structure leads to the antiaromaticity in this cluster. In this cluster sp2 hybridization

of Al takes place leaving one empty un-hybridized p orbital. The valence electron of each of

the four Li atoms is then transfered to this empty pz orbital, thus providing 4 − π electrons

for antiaromaticity. Interestingly, its ﬁrst low-lying structure (ﬁgure 1c(ii)) can also be con-

sidered as a candidate for antiaromaticity. It has a planar Al4 structure. An analysis of the

MOs shows that this cluster also has 4 − π electrons similar to the lowest energy structure,

thereby conforming the structural and electron count criteria for antiaromaticity. However,

a detailed analysis of the magnetic ﬁeld induced ring currents has to be done in order to

understand the antiaromaticity in this structure.

As discussed in section III A, the structures of Al5Li5 and Al6Li8 (in fcc geometry) clusters

show a square-plane of Al4. Such Al4 square-plane in Al2−

4 and Li-Al−

4 has lead to aromaticity

in these clusters [8]. Moreover, these clusters show a three dimensional octahedral growth of

3. Al5Li5 and Al6Li8

12

the Al cluster. Hence, it is interesting to discuss the change in bonding, and hence the eﬀect

on the aromaticity in the clusters, Al2−

4 , Li-Al−

4 , Al5Li5 and Al6Li8. Recall that Al2−

4 and

Li-Al−

4 are aromatic clusters with 2 − π electrons [8]. The HOMO state in these clusters are

completely delocalized π orbitals. There are two more delocalized σ bonds: one composed

of radial p orbitals, and the other composed of perpendicular p orbitals. Due to the presence

of a Al4 square-plane, the bonding in Al5Li5 and Al6Li8 clusters is expected to be similar

to that in Al2−

Al2−

4 and Li-Al−

4 . In that case, these clusters would have 2 − π electrons similar to that of

4 , and show some signature of aromaticity. Interestingly, the HOMO state of

Al5Li5 does show such a delocalized π bond between the Al4 square (ﬁgure 8a). However, a

lone electron is seen at the ﬁfth Al atom that caps this square. This reduces the number of π

electrons to one. Thus, due to the presence of just 1 − π electron the aromaticity is lost. The

HOMO state of Al6Li8, on the other hand, is quite diﬀerent than that seen in the previous

clusters (ﬁgure 8b).

It shows a localized bond composed of a p orbital of the Al atom.

Moreover, its eigenvalue spectrum (ﬁgure 7) shows nearly a jellium-like structure. However,

an analysis of the behavior of the molecular orbitals (ﬁgure not shown) of Al6Li8 shows that

the lower ten states are jellium-like, whereas, the higher states are localized bonds composed

of p orbitals. The 6th state in Al5Li5 and the 10th state in Al6Li8 are σ-bonded, composed of

radial p orbitals (ﬁgure 8c, and 8d, respectively), and are analogous to the radial p orbitals

of Al2−

4 . However, these bonds involve all the Al atoms, thus leading to a higher degree of

delocalization.

4. AlnLin (n = 7 − 11)

The bonding in these clusters (AlnLin, n = 7 − 11), is quite diﬀerent from that of

the smaller clusters. A mixture of localized and delocalized bonds is seen. Analysis of

the behavior of the MOs shows that the eigenvalue spectrum of AlnLin can be classiﬁed

into two groups: the lower n states are jellium-like, whereas, the higher states forms a

complex band of localized bonds. The lower states can be identiﬁed as 1s, 1p, 1d, 2s,..., in

13

conformation to the SJM. A typical representative isodensity plot of these orbitals is shown

in ﬁgure 9. Further, the eigenvalue spectrum 7 shows a clear energy separation of these

orbitals from the higher orbitals. In order to study this more extensively, we have performed

the spherical harmonics analysis of the KS orbitals [44]. We ﬁnd that the lower n orbitals

have a clear s character (75-85%), whereas, the higher orbitals show a clear p character.

The lower orbitals corresponds to the 3s orbital of the Al atom, which hybridize to form

a jellium. However, this description cannot be extended to the higher states. The higher

states, composed of Al-3p orbital, forms a complex band of localized bonds. This localized

bonding is also reﬂected in the ELF discussed below.

The localized bonding in the Al-Li clusters can be analyzed via the electron localization

function plots. Previous investigations show that even in large Al-Li clusters, the Al-Al

bond is covalent. However, our analysis on the structural properties shows a clustering of

Al atoms enclosed in Li cage. This clustering could lead to a delocalization of the electron

density. In order to study this more extensively, we have done an analysis of the electron

localization function in the AlnLin clusters. In ﬁgure 10, we show the isovalued surface of

the ELF for the clusters Al2Li2, Al5Li5, and Al10Li10, respectively. The Al-Al bond in these

systems is seen at the ELF values of 0.85, 0.8, and 0.72, respectively. It is known that an

ELF value greater than 0.7 corresponds to a localized bond [31]. Thus, the Al-Al bonds

in these clusters are covalent in accordance with the previous observation. However, as the

cluster grows, the localization of the electron density in these clusters is reduced. Further,

the localization in Al5Li5 is only in the plane forming the square (for out of plane, the ELF

value is 0.7). A similar behavior of the ELF for Al7Li7 (not shown in ﬁgure) is seen, in

that, a localized bond along the pentagon (ELF value = 0.78) and delocalized bond in the

perpendicular direction (ELF value = 0.6).

IV. TETRAVALENT BEHAVIOR OF Al IN AlnLin CLUSTERS

Previous investigations on mixed Al-Li clusters [21,45,46], have shown a substantial

charge transfer from the Li atom to the Al atom. Due to such charge transfer, Al be-

haves as a tetravalent atom in mixed Al-Li clusters with nearly 50:50 percent concentration.

In this section, we discuss such behavior of Aln cluster in AlnLin enclosed in Li cage. Anal-

ysis of the geometries of AlnLin clusters show some remarkable similarities of the clusters of

the Aln in AlnLin to those of the tetravalent atoms viz., Si, Ge, Sn and Pb. For instance, the

behavior of Al2 in Al2Li2, observed by Kumar [21], was similar to that of Si2, in the sense

that the Al-Al bond length of 4.48a.u. is comparable to that of 4.39a.u. in Si2. Moreover,

the transition from the planar to three dimensional geometry at n = 5, the appearance of

a pentagonal ring at n = 7, and the formation of the distorted TTP structure of Al10 in

Al10Li10 indicate a tetravalent behavior of the Al atom. The eigenvalue spectrum, in ﬁgure 7,

of the Al10Li10 show remarkable similarity to that of the Sn10 cluster. The bonding between

Al-Al in these clusters is covalent, which is similar to that in the clusters of tetravalent

atoms. Finally, the resemblance of the DOS of the Al-Li in its most stable bulk phase i.e.

B32, to that of diamond [24] also indicates a tetravalent behavior of the Al atom in Al-Li

systems with 50:50 concentration.

V. CONCLUSION

In the present work, we have reported the systematic investigations of the geometry,

energetics, electronic structure and the bonding in various Al-Li clusters viz. AlnLin (n=1-

11), Al−

2 , Al2−

2 , Al2Li, Al2Li−, and Al6Li8 using BOMD method within the framework of

density functional theory. The bonding in these clusters was discussed via the electron

localization function as well as the behavior of the occupied molecular orbitals. The growth

pattern is divided into two broad categories: ﬁrst consisting of a quinted roof of Al2Li2 (n=2-

4) and second consisting of a pentagonal ring (n=7-9). We ﬁnd that the 8, 20, and 40 valence

15

electron systems are magic, exhibiting a peak in the dissociation energy, a minima in the

second diﬀerence in energy, and a large HOMO-LUMO gap. The structural transition of

Aln in AlnLin, from two dimensional to three dimensional increases the surface area, thereby

helping the Li atoms to maximize the Al-Li bonds as a result of which the Li atoms move

closer to the Al atoms. The bonding between Al and Li atoms in Al2Li2 is covalent, whereas,

in larger clusters it is ionic. A charge transfer from Li atoms to Al atoms makes Al behave

as a tetravalent atom like Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb in AlnLin clusters. These negatively charged

Aln structures are stabilized by the positive Li environment. The formation of the three

dimensional Aln structure destroys the aromatic and antiaromatic nature in these clusters.

In clusters with more than six Al atoms, the behavior of the occupied MOs can be grouped

into lower jellium-like and higher localized bonds. Moreover, the bonding between Al and

Li atoms is ionic. Thus, a mixture of localized, delocalized, and ionic bonds is seen in these

clusters. As the clusters grow, an eﬀective delocalization is of the valence charge density is

seen via the electron localization function.

Abstract

New type of nonlinear (anharmonic) excitations — bushes of vibrational modes — in

physical systems with point or space symmetry are discussed. All infrared active and

Raman active bushes for C60 fulerene are found by means of special group-theoretical

methods.

1 Introduction

Vibrations of many fullerenes and fullerites were investigated by diﬀerent experimen-

tal and theoretical methods (see [1, 2] and references in these papers). Although the

majority of such studies are based on the harmonic approximation only, some non-

linear (anharmonic) eﬀects also were discussed in a number of papers. For example,

combination modes of second order brought about by anharmonicity of interactions in

C60 fullerene are discussed and the appropriate lines in infrared transmission spectra are

reported in [3]. The above eﬀects does not exhaust the inﬂuence of anharmonicity on

the fullerene and fullerite vibrational spectra, and we want to consider an application

for these objects of the consistent group-theoretical approach for studying nonlinear

vibrations in arbitrary physical systems with discrete (point or space) symmetry de-

veloped in [4, 5, 6, 7]. This approach reveals the existence of new nonlinear dynamical

objects (or new type of anharmonic excitations) in systems with discrete symmetry

which we call bushes of normal modes. The concept of the bush of modes can be

explained as follows.

In the frame of the harmonic approximation, the set of normal modes can be in-

troduced which are classiﬁed by irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetry

group G of the considered physical system in equilibrium. In this harmonic approxi-

mation, normal modes are independent of each other, while interactions between them

appear when some anharmonic terms in the Hamiltonian are taken into account. Let

us note that a very speciﬁc pattern of atomic displacements corresponds to each nor-

mal mode. As a consequence, we can ascribe to a given mode a deﬁnite symmetry

group GD which is a subgroup of the symmetry group G. The group GD is a symmetry

group of the instantaneous conﬁguration of our system in its vibrational state.

Let us excite at the initial instant t0 only one, arbitrarily chosen mode which will

be called the root mode. We suppose that all other modes at the initial moment have

zero amplitude. Let the symmetry group GD and irrep Γ0 correspond to this root

mode. Then we can pose the following question: to which other modes can this initial

excitation spread from the root mode? We will refer to these initially “sleeping” modes,

belonging to the diﬀerent irreps Γj (j 6= 0), as secondary modes.

A very simple answer to the above question was found in [4, 5]. It turns out that

initial excitation can spread from the root mode only to those modes whose symmetry

is higher than or equal to the symmetry group GD of the root mode. We call the

complete collection containing the root mode and all secondary modes corresponded

to it a bush of modes. Since no other modes are excited, the full energy is trapped

in the given bush. As a consequence of the above idea, we can ascribe the symmetry

group GD (remember that this is a group of the root mode) to the whole bush, and in

this sense we can consider the bush as a geometrical object.

It was proved in [4, 5, 6] that all modes belonging to a given bush B [GD] are

coupled by force interactions. It is very important that the structure of a given bush

is independent of the type of interactions between particles of our physical system.

A bush of normal modes can be considered as a dynamical object, as well. Indeed, the

set of modes corresponding to a given bush B [GD] does not change in time, while the

amplitudes of these modes do change. We can write exact dynamical equations for the

amplitudes of the modes contained in the bush B [GD], if interactions between particles

of our physical system are known. Thus, the bush B [GD] represents a dynamical system

whose dimension can be essentially less than that of the original physical system.

The above properties of bushes of normal modes can be summarized in the following

manner. A normal mode represents a speciﬁc dynamical regime in a linear physical

system which, upon being exciting at the initial instant t0, continues to exist for any

time t > t0. Similarly, a bush of normal modes represents a speciﬁc dynamical regime

in a nonlinear system which can exist as a certain object for any time t > t0.

2 Some mathematical aspects of bushes of normal

modes

Let us examine a nonlinear mechanical system of N mass points (atoms) whose Hamil-

tonian is described by a point or space group G. Let three-dimensional vectors xi(t) (i =

1, 2, . . . , N) determine the displacement of the i-th atom from its equilibrium position

at time t. The 3 × N-dimensional vector X(t) = {x1(t), x2(t), . . . , xN (t)}, describ-

ing the full set of atomic displacements, can be decomposed into the basis vectors

(symmetry-adapted coordinates) of all irreps Γj of the group G contained in the me-

chanical representation1 Γ :

X(t) = X

µji(t)ϕ(j)

i = X
j

∆j.

(1)

Here ϕ(j)
i

is the i-th basis vector of the nj-dimensional irrep Γj. The time dependence

of X(t) is contained only in the coeﬃcients µji(t) while the basis vectors are time

independent. Thus, a given nonlinear dynamical regime of the mechanical system

described by the concrete vector X(t) can be written as a sum of the contributions ∆j

from the individual irreps Γj of the group G.

Each vibrational regime X(t), can be associated with a deﬁnite subgroup GD (GD ⊆

G) which describes the symmetry of the instantaneous conﬁguration of this system.

Now the following essential idea is proposed. The subgroup GD is preserved in time;

its elements cannot disappear during time evolution except in the case of spontaneous

breaking of symmetry which we will not consider in the present paper. This is the

direct consequence of the principle of determinism in classical mechanics.

Introducing operators ˆg ∈ ˆG acting on the 3N-dimensional vectors X(t), which

correspond to elements g ∈ G acting on three-dimensional vectors xi(t), we can write

the above condition of preservation of GD as a condition of invariance of the vector X(t)

under the action of the elements of the group GD:

ˆg X(t) = X(t), g ∈ GD.

(2)

Combining Eqs. (1) and (2) one obtains (for the details see [6]) the following invariance

conditions for individual irreps Γj:

(3)
1Considering vibrational regimes only, we can treat Γ as a 3N − 6 vibrational representation of the

(Γj ↓ GD) cj = cj.

group G.

Here Γj ↓ GD is the restriction of the irrep Γj of the group G to the subgroup GD,

i.e. the set of matrices of Γj which correspond to the elements g ∈ GD only. The nj-

dimensional vector cj in Eq. (3) is the invariant vector in the carrier space of the irrep Γj

corresponding to the given subgroup GD ⊂ G. Note that each invariant vector of a

given irrep Γj determines a certain subspace of the carrier space of this representation,

and the total number of arbitrary constants upon which the vector depends is equal

to the dimension of this subspace. If in solving Eq. (3) we ﬁnd that cj 6= 0, then the

irrep Γj does contribute to the dynamical regime X(t) with the symmetry group GD.

Moreover, the invariant vector cj determines the explicit form of the mode of the

irrep Γj belonging to the bush of modes associated with the given nonlinear dynamical

regime.

We will illustrate the general statements of bush theory with the C60 fullerene with

buckyball structure and with the icosahedral symmetry group G = Ih. There are

10 irreducible representations of dimensions 1 (Ag, Au), 3 (F1g, F1u, F2g, F2u), 4 (Gg,

Gu) and 5 (Hg, Hu) associated with the group Ih. The infrared (IR) active modes

belong to the irrep F1u, and modes which are active in Raman (R) experiments belong

to irreps Ag or Hg. We found all bushes of modes for C60 fullerene. There are 22

diﬀerent bushes for this fullerene. Let us consider the bush B7 corresponding to the

symmetry group GD = C5v ⊂ Ih. Only four irreps Ag, Hg, F1u and F2u contribute

to it (the appropriate invariant vectors are zero for all other irreps of the icosahedral

group G = Ih) 2:

B7 : [symmetry C5v] : Ag (a) – Ih, Hg (a, 0.577a, 0, 0.516a, −0.258a) – D5d

(4)

F1u (0, 0, a) – C5v, F2u (a, 0.258a, 0.197a) – C5v.

The arbitrary constants entering into the description of diﬀerent invariant vectors are

not connected with each other. As all invariant vectors listed in Eq. (4) are one-

parametric (their arbitrary constants are denoted by the same symbol a only for clar-

ity), it is clear that the bush B7 depends on four arbitrary constants (one constant

numbers, we keep only three digits after the decimal point when we write the invariant vectors.

for each of the four irreps). The structure Eq. (4) of the bush B7 shows that there

exist only four contributions ∆j to the appropriate dynamical regime X(t). We denote

them3 as ∆[Ag], ∆[Hg], ∆[F1u], ∆[F2u]. The invariant vectors listed in Eq. (4) permit

us immediately to write the explicit form of the dynamical regime X(t) correspond-

ing to the bush B7 by replacing the arbitrary constants with the four functions of

time µ(t), ν(t), γ(t) and ξ(t):

X(t) = ∆[Ag] + ∆[Hg] + ∆[F1u] + ∆[F2u] =

µ(t)ϕ[Ag] + ν(t){ϕ1[Hg] + 0.577ϕ2[Hg] + 0.516ϕ4[Hg] − 0.258ϕ5[Hg]}+

(5)

γ(t)ϕ3[F1u] + ξ(t){ϕ1[F2u] + 0.258ϕ2[F2u] + 0.197ϕ3[F2u]}.

Eq. (5) is a consequence of the relation of the group G and its subgroup GD only, and

now we must take into account the concrete structure of our physical system to ﬁnd

the explicit form of the basis vectors ϕ(j)
i

of the irreps entering into Eq. (5). They can

be obtained by conventional group-theoretical methods, for example, by the projection

operation method. The basis vectors of the irreps determine the speciﬁc patterns of

the displacements of all 60 atoms of the C60 fullerene structure.

It is important to note that each of the irreps Ag, Hg, F1u and F2u is contained

in the vibrational representation of the C60 fullerene several times, namely, 2, 8, 4

and 5 times, respectively. (These numbers are equal to the numbers of fundamental

frequencies of normal modes associated with the considered irreps). As a consequence,

we must treat the time-dependent coeﬃcients in Eq. (5) as vectors of the appropriate

dimensions. Because of this we ascribe a new index (k) to the basis vectors determining

the number of times (mj) the irrep Γj enters into the vibrational representation. Each

contribution ∆j “splits” into mj copies ∆jk, where k = 1, 2, . . . , mj and, therefore,

(

(6)

For the case of bush B7 we have ∆[Ag] = ∆1[Ag] + ∆2[Ag], ∆[F1u] = ∆1[F1u] +

∆2[F1u] + ∆3[F1u] + ∆4[F1u], etc.

3Hereafter we write the symbol j of the irrep Γj generating the contribution ∆j in square brackets

next to symbol ∆.

The bush B7 in the C60 fullerene structure forms a 19-dimensional dynamical ob-

ject:

its evolution is described by the dynamical variables listed below as compo-

nents of the four vectorial variables µ(t), ν(t), γ(t) and ξ(t): µ(t) = [µ1(t), µ2(t)],

ν(t) = [ν1(t), . . . , ν8(t)], γ(t) = [γ1(t), . . . , γ4(t)], ξ(t) = [ξ1(t), . . . , ξ5(t)].

Thus, although only four of the ten irreps contribute to the bush B7, its dimension

is equal to 19 because several copies of each of these four irreps are contained in the full

vibrational representation of C60 fullerene. We cannot predict the concrete evolution

of the amplitudes of the bush modes without speciﬁc information of the nonlinear

interactions in the considered physical systems, but we can assert that there does exist

an exact nonlinear regime which involves only the modes belonging to a given bush.

3 Optical bushes for C60 fullerene

As was already noted, there are 22 bushes of vibrational modes for C60 fullerene struc-

ture. Five of them are infrared active and six are Raman active. We call these bushes

by the term “optical”. The root modes of the optical bushes belong to the infrared

active irrep F1u or to the Raman active irreps Ag and Hg. We want to emphasize that

some modes associated with the irreps which are not active in optics can be contained

in a given optical bush.

All optical bushes with their symmetry groups (in square brackets), numbers of

irreps contributing to them and their dimensions (in parentheses) are listed below.

Infrared active bushes:
B7 [C5v] (4, 19); B11 [C3v] (6, 31);

B15 [C2v] (7, 46);

B19 [Cs] (9, 89); B22 [C1] (10, 174).
Raman active bushes:
B1 [Ih] (1, 2);

B4 [D5d] (2, 10);

B5 [D3d] (3, 16);

B10 [D2h] (3, 24); B16 [C2h] (5, 45); B20 [Ci] (5, 87).

Supposing that nonlinearity of the considered system is weak4 we can estimate the

relative values of the contributions from diﬀerent irreps to a given bush. For example,

4According to results obtained in the paper [3] this hypothesis valid for C60 fullerene vibrations.

for above discussed infrared active bush B7 we have

∆[F1u](root) = O(ε); ∆[F1u](secondary) = O(ε3);

∆[F2u] = O(ε3); ∆[Ag] = O(ε2); ∆[Hg] = O(ε2).

Here ε is an appropriate small parameter characterizing the value of the root mode.

Thus, in the case of weak nonlinearity, the contributions of diﬀerent irreps can be of

essentially diﬀerent value. This property seems to be important for the interpretation

of the vibrational spectra of bushes of modes.

4 Conclusion

In the present paper, we consider a new type of possible nonlinear excitations — bushes

of normal modes — in vibrational spectra of fullerenes and fullerites, using as an ex-

ample the C60 buckyball structure. We believe that special experiments for revealing

the bushes of vibrational modes in their pure form will be important for further elu-

cidation of the role of these fundamental dynamical objects in various phenomena in

fullerenes and fullerites. It seems that such experiments may be similar to those by

Martin and others reported in [3]. However, unlike these experiments, we must use the

monochromatic incident light with frequency close to that of the root mode and with

polarization along the symmetry axis of the chosen bush.

The ﬁrst-principle calculations are desirable for obtaining the coeﬃcients of the

anharmonic terms in the C60 fullerene for a more detailed description of the bush

dynamics.

The concept of bushes of normal modes and the appropriate mathematical methods

for their analysis are valid for both molecular and crystal structures. Such a possibility

can simplify the assignment of the diﬀerent optical lines in fullerites brought about by

both intra- and inter-vibrations of the C60 molecular clusters.

It will be very interesting to study interactions between bushes of vibrational modes

and electron subsystems in fullerenes and fullerites.

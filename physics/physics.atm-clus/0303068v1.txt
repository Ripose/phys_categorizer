Using neon and its dimer as a speciﬁc example, it is shown that excited Auger decay channels
that are electronically stable in the isolated monomer can relax in a cluster by electron emission.
The decay mechanism, leading to the formation of a tricationic cluster, is based on an eﬃcient
energy-transfer process from the excited, dicationic monomer to a neighbor. The decay is ultrafast
and expected to be relevant to numerous physical phenomena involving core holes in clusters and
other forms of spatially extended atomic and molecular matter.

Physical processes accompanying the interaction of X-ray photons with matter are of fundamental importance in
nature, research, and application. The investigation of clusters [1], which form a natural bridge between isolated
atoms and macroscopic matter, oﬀers unique insight into the microscopic workings of cooperative eﬀects taking
place after X-ray absorption. In this letter we report on a novel eﬀect that has not found previous consideration.
Its consequences are of general relevance for understanding how electron correlation in a material drives multiple
ionization and fragmentation upon exposure to high-energy radiation.

R¨uhl et al. carried out a series of experiments in which they created core holes in the 2p shell of argon clusters
of diﬀerent sizes [2, 3]. They investigated the level of fragmentation of the clusters and concluded that, after the
monomer with the initial core hole becomes dicationic upon Auger electron emission, one of the two positive charges
is transferred to a neighboring atom—a relatively slow process taking place on a timescale of picoseconds, since energy
conservation requires nuclear motion to set in. In small clusters, the consequence is fragmentation through Coulomb
explosion. Dicationic clusters exceeding a critical size can be stable. It must be pointed out, however, that analyzing
data from experiments on a neutral cluster beam is very diﬃcult because the distribution of cluster sizes in a beam is
rather broad [1]. Only the average size can be adjusted. It is, therefore, not trivial to correlate mass-spectroscopically
observed fragments with a parent cluster of ﬁxed size. In fact, multicoincidence mass spectra published later by R¨uhl
and co-workers clearly demonstrated the relevance of triple ionization processes in core-excited clusters [4] but did
not reveal the underlying physics.

We have found an eﬃcient, new mechanism for triple ionization of clusters, following the absorption of a single
X-ray photon. Our argument relies on the fact that many of the dications produced in Auger decay are not in their
electronic ground state but are highly excited. In order to clarify our point, we pick a speciﬁc example and restrict
the discussion to neon and its dimer. It will become clear in the course of our presentation how most conclusions can
be extended to larger neon aggregates as well as to clusters consisting of monomers other than neon. This underscores
the general nature of the new process.

There are three conceivable routes to producing Ne3+ by removal of a core electron from a neon atom. First, in
the shake-oﬀ band of the photoelectron spectrum, the core hole is accompanied by a valence hole plus a free electron,
a process commonly interpreted as a consequence of the contraction of the atomic shells in the presence of the core
hole [5]. Auger decay of the core-excited dication yields a trication. Second, the core-hole main state can undergo
double Auger decay [6], thereby emitting two correlated electrons. At a photon energy of 1.5 keV, for instance, these
two processes are responsible for the triple ionization of about 21% of all neon atoms that have absorbed an X-ray
photon [7] (see also [8]).

double ionization potential [eV]

FIG. 1: Double ionization potentials of Ne and Ne2, computed by means of the ADC(2) approximation of the two-particle
Green’s function [13, 14]. The respective triple ionization thresholds are indicated with dotted lines.

The third process one might think of is autoionization of some of the Auger decay channels themselves. These
channels are shown in Table I. The data are taken from Ref. [9]. We have converted the Auger energies to double
ionization potentials by making use of the binding energy, 870.2 eV, of a neon 1s electron [10]. The Auger transition
to the 3D ground state of Ne++ is suppressed for symmetry reasons. Note that almost 30% of all dications produced
in Auger decay of Ne+(1s−1) are highly excited, possessing at least one hole in the inner-valence (2s) shell. Yet, not
one of these can relax by electron emission, since the triple ionization threshold, 126.0 eV [11], of a single, isolated
neon atom is energetically too high.

The easiest way to lower the triple ionization threshold—without signiﬁcantly modifying the core ionization and
the subsequent Auger process—is to add another neon atom, i.e., to consider Ne2 (or larger neon clusters). Indeed,
owing to the weak van der Waals interaction between the two neon atoms, both removal of a 1s electron as well as
Auger decay of the resulting core hole are essentially of atomic nature. As illustrated by the double ionization spectra
of Ne and Ne2 in Fig. 1, the relevant double ionization channels in a neon atom are hardly aﬀected by the presence of
an adjacent Ne. The interatomic distance in Ne2 was taken to be 3.2 ˚A, corresponding to the equilibrium geometry
in the ground state of the van der Waals system [12]. The two-site states of (Ne2)++, which are characterized by one
positive charge on each atom, are not expected to become populated under the circumstances considered here.

We calculated the double ionization spectra using the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) scheme for the
two-particle propagator [13, 14]. ADC(n) represents a sophisticated perturbation-theoretical approximation of a
many-body Green’s function, which is complete up to nth order and includes in addition inﬁnite summations over
certain classes of diagrams contributing to the expansion. Here, we employed ADC(2); all orbital energies and
molecular integrals needed were taken from closed-shell Hartree-Fock calculations. On the center of each neon atom
we placed the Gaussian basis set d-aug-cc-pVTZ [15]. Core polarization eﬀects were investigated and found to be
negligible. The calculated double ionization energies for the Auger channels of the single atom are in good agreement
with Table I. The pole strengths shown in Fig. 1 are related to the residues of the two-particle propagator at its
poles. Values smaller than one indicate for the main states an admixture of three-hole one-particle excitations to the
two-hole conﬁgurations.

The triple ionization threshold of Ne2 is obviously lower than that of the isolated atom, because in the dimer the three
positive charges do not have to be localized to a single atomic site; however, it remains to be proven that this threshold
is lower than any of the inner-valence excited one-site states of (Ne2)++. To that end we performed multireference
conﬁguration interaction calculations with a program written by Hanrath and Engels [16]. The basis set used was again
d-aug-cc-pVTZ. For (Ne2)3+, the reference space was chosen to consist of all three-hole conﬁgurations with respect to
the Hartree-Fock ground state of neutral neon dimer. We ﬁrst represented the electronic Hamiltonian in the reference
space and computed the energies of the lowest doublet and quartet states, which correlate with Ne+(2p−1) 2P +
Ne++(2p−12p−1) 3D. Then we augmented the many-electron basis by including additionally all single excitations of
the reference space, i.e., all four-hole one-particle conﬁgurations, and, ﬁnally, all double excitations (ﬁve-hole two-
particle conﬁgurations). The results are summarized in Table II. On the energy scale shown, the lowest doublet state
and the lowest quartet state of (Ne2)3+ are virtually degenerate.

For the dicationic states of neon dimer we pursued a similar strategy. In this case the reference space comprised
all two-hole conﬁgurations. We found that the one-site states associated with the atomic Ne++(2s−12p−1) 1P and
the Ne++(2s−12s−1) 1S Auger channels are indeed above the triple ionization threshold, as demonstrated by the
corresponding entry in Table II. The total energies of (Ne2)++ and (Ne2)3+ converge only slowly as a function of
conﬁguration space, but the energy diﬀerence between the two species is obviously positive: In all conﬁguration spaces
studied, the inner-valence excited one-site state of (Ne2)++ is systematically higher by at least 6 eV than the triple
ionization threshold of neon dimer. We conclude this state, which is rather eﬃciently populated in the Auger decay
of neon core holes (cf. Table I), is electronically unstable.

The triple ionization threshold of Ne2 can be estimated to be—at most—92.5 eV. Assuming the Coulomb interaction
between one Ne+ and one Ne++, each being in its respective ground state, to be that of two point-like charges separated
by 3.2 ˚A, we obtain approximately the same value. This indicates the pronounced charge localization in the tricationic
dimer: One positive charge is on one atom, two positive charges are on the other. We exploit this and the fact that
one-site states in (Ne2)++ are practically indistinguishable from purely atomic Auger channels (see Fig. 1) for a simple
analysis of the mechanism underlying the electronic decay of singlet (Ne2)++.

The transition from the initial to the ﬁnal state is mediated by electron correlation, i.e., by the inﬂuence of the

Eq. (4) and the second term of Eq. (5) describe an electron-transfer process from the neutral atom to the inner-
valence hole of Ne++. The electron-transfer integral is very small because of the negligible overlap between the
spatially compact 2s orbital on the dication and occupied orbitals on the adjacent atom.

The decay mechanism is best represented by the ﬁrst term of Eq. (5).

It allows us to formulate the following
physical picture. An electron from a 2p orbital on Ne++ drops into the inner-valence hole. The released energy is
transferred, via virtual-photon exchange, to the neon atom. As a consequence, an electron is ejected with a kinetic
energy of about 6 eV, which is energetically feasible owing to the spatial separation of the resulting hole from the two
positive charges on the atomic dication. The tricationic dimer eventually undergoes Coulomb explosion.

The mechanism described is analogous to the one discovered in singly ionized, inner-valence excited hydrogen-
bonded [18] and van der Waals clusters [19]. This mechanism is called Interatomic Coulombic Decay (ICD), which
we now have shown to be active in a previously unexpected context. A detailed Wigner-Weisskopf analysis of ICD in
monocationic clusters is presented in Ref. [20]. The coupling matrix element
derived there is similar to the
one given above, if we assume the wavefunction of the ICD electron is comparable in both cases. In fact, the kinetic
energy of the ICD electron here is also just a few electronvolts, corresponding to a de Broglie wavelength of the order
of 1 nm, so that cancellation eﬀects in the coupling matrix element, which might arise due to the oscillatory behavior
of the free electron’s wavefunction, do not play a role. On this basis, we expect decay lifetimes of inner-valence excited,
dicationic clusters of the order of 100 fs or shorter.

For the purpose of demonstrating this to be correct, we utilized a technique called CAP/CI [21], i.e., the combination
of multireference conﬁguration interaction with a complex absorbing potential (CAP) [22]. A review of non-Hermitian
electronic theory can be found in Ref. [23]. CAP/CI allows the direct ab initio calculation of the Siegert energy of a
decaying state, Eres = ER
iΓ/2, where ER is the resonance position and Γ the decay width. The computations are
rather challenging and expensive, so we reduced the compact part of the Gaussian basis set to d-aug-cc-pVDZ [15],
but added a set of diﬀuse basis functions: three s, p, and d functions, respectively. These are needed to improve the
representation of the outgoing ICD electron being absorbed by the CAP. Within a conﬁguration space consisting of
all two-hole and three-hole one-particle conﬁgurations, we calculated a decay lifetime of about 80 fs for each of the
six one-site, inner-valence excited 1P states of (Ne2)++.

−

Using a model system—the neon dimer—we have shown that the possibility of charge separation in a cluster can
give rise to a new, energy-transfer based decay mechanism accessible to a number of Auger decay channels. In our
speciﬁc example, more than 20% of all dications produced in the Auger process will undergo ICD and form trications.
There are no reasons to suppose our simple and general arguments be restricted to neon clusters. We have found
ﬁrst indications that a similar eﬀect exists in water clusters as well. The analogy to ICD in singly ionized systems
implies an interesting dependence of the ICD lifetime on the number of nearest neighbors [20]: Since each neighboring
monomer contributes decay channels, we expect the lifetime to drop signiﬁcantly as neighbors are added to an inner-
valence excited dication. In other words, the lifetime in a dimer is just an upper limit to what has to be expected in
a bigger cluster. Therefore, in general the ICD lifetime is so short that alternative relaxation mechanisms are likely
to be irrelevant.

Our ﬁndings should have consequences for the interpretation of existing experimental data on core-hole relaxation
in weakly bound clusters. Even more important might be the impact on the fragmentation pattern of clusters, and
larger molecules, exposed to the intense radiation of a future X-ray laser. If the laser pulse is to be used for structure
determination through X-ray scattering, then the fragmentation timescale should be larger than the pulse length.
Otherwise, the structure being measured is just an average over several Coulomb explosion stages. Simulations,
incorporating the usual photoionization and Auger processes, have shown that single protein molecules interacting
with an intense femtosecond X-ray laser pulse disintegrate completely [24]. Electron correlation eﬀects like ICD lead
to even higher charge states and, thus, to shorter fragmentation timescales. This will have to be taken into account
in future experiments.

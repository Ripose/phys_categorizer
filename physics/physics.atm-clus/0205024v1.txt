Abstract

The freezing behavior of gold nanoclusters was studied by employing molecular dynamics simu-

lations based on a semi-empirical embedded-atom method. Investigations of the gold nanoclusters

revealed that, just after freezing, ordered nano-surfaces with a ﬁvefold symmetry were formed

with interior atoms remaining in the disordered state. Further lowering of temperatures induced

nano-crystallization of the interior atoms that proceeded from the surface towards the core region,

ﬁnally leading to an icosahedral structure. These dynamic processes explain why the icosahedral

cluster structure is dominantly formed in spite of its energetic metastability.

Nano sized metal clusters containing tens to thousands of atoms have attracted great

attention due to their possible applications as catalysts and surface nanostructures [1, 2, 3].

In particular, understanding and predicting the structural properties and formation of clus-

ters produced from the liquid state or gas phase are major concerns in investigations of the

controlled growth of low dimensional structures. Unlike bulk materials, small metal clusters

exhibit various structural modiﬁcations, for example, for fcc metals, cuboctahedra (CO)

with a face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure, twinned fcc (containing one or several parallel

twin planes) [4, 5], twinned hexagonal close packed (hcp) [6], icosahedral and truncated

icosahedral (Ih) [5, 7, 8, 9, 10], truncated decahedral (Dh) [7, 8, 9], and amorphous [11].

Notably, high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM), under typical cluster-growth condi-

tions, routinely detected metal clusters of Ih or Dh morphology with a ﬁvefold symmetry of

noncrystallographic atomic arrangements [7].

The thermodynamical-equilibrium forms and structures of metal clusters have been ex-

haustively searched and discussed on the basis of theoretical calculations.

In contrast to

experimental observations, theoretical calculations suggest that for Au, the Ih structure is

energetically metastable even for small clusters (less than 100 atoms) with a large surface-

to-volume ratio [12, 13]. With increasing cluster size, the stability of the Ih structure should

decrease markedly due to accumulated strain energy [12]. HREM studies [5, 7, 8, 9, 10],

however, have revealed that even larger clusters (up to a few thousand atoms) still have Ih or

Dh morphologies. Real-time microscopic studies by Iijima and Ichihashi [14] demonstrated

structural changes in gold clusters from a single crystalline form to a twinned crystalline

form of the Ih or Dh structures, and vice versa, originating from electron beam irradia-

tion (charging eﬀect). Such experimental observations emphasize that the formation of Ih

clusters is governed by kinetic rather than thermodynamic factors.

In order to understand the kinetics, we investigated the structural changes of gold nan-

oclusters during cooling from a molten state by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simu-

lations. We found that the Ih structure originates from surface ordering not from conven-

tional core nucleation. At the initial stage of the freezing, close-packed (111)-type planes

with a ﬁvefold Ih symmetry were formed at surfaces before the interior of the cluster crys-

tallized. Subsequently, nano-crystallization at lower temperatures propagated inward from

these (111)-type surface segments, leading to the Ih cluster.

All MD simulations of gold nanoclusters were performed using a semi-empirical

embedded-atom method [15]. We used the XMD code described in Ref. 16.

In simula-

tions we used an Ih cluster of 561 atoms as an initial structure. The cluster was then heated

to 1500 K, well above its melting temperature to ensure complete melting, and equilibrated
for a long period of more than 250 ps (∼ 1.3 × 105∆t, where ∆t =2.0 fs represents the time
step for the integration of the equation of motion). The cluster was cooled to 300 K at 1011
K/s (2.0 × 10−4 K/∆t); the temperature was set through the mean kinetic energy of the

atoms. In order to analyze the cluster structure eﬀectively without vibrational noise, all the

atomic conﬁgurations were relaxed to the local energy-minimum conﬁgurations using the

conjugated gradient minimization technique.

Our simulations at diﬀerent initial conﬁgurations showed that most of the 561 atom

clusters were frozen to an Ih structure at a cooling rate of 1011 K/s. A similar result was

reported by Chushak et al.

in their computational experiment [17]. Typical melting and

freezing behavior of the clusters was displayed by the potential energy vs.

curve (see Figure 1). The melting and freezing phase transition can be identiﬁed by an

abrupt change in potential energy, with a rather strong hysteresis between the melting and

freezing. Interestingly, we here see two diﬀerent types of freezing behavior under identical

cooling condition. In the ﬁrst case shown by the freezing curve ‘A’ in Fig. 1, the cluster

underwent a sharp liquid-solid transition and the freezing point was estimated as 706 K. In

the second case shown by the freezing curve ‘B’ in Fig. 1, the liquid-solid transition took

place over tens of degrees of temperature.

For detailed analysis of the freezing behavior we looked at cluster conﬁgurations corre-

sponding to the three open circles (at 750, 700, and 650 K, respectively) in freezing curve

‘A’ of Fig. 1 [see Figs. 2(a), 2(b) and 2(c)]. We also show an ideal Ih structure of a 561-atom

cluster for comparison [see Fig. 2(d)]. At 750 K, which is well above the freezing tempera-

ture, the cluster was in a liquid state. The atoms were disordered and the cluster shape was

highly ﬂuctuating and approximately spherical. Notably, as the freezing temperature was

approached, ﬂat surface segments like solid facets started to appear temporarily. The abrupt

decrease of potential energy shown in Fig. 1 indicates that the cluster at 700 K had just

frozen. At 700 K, the cluster showed ordered facets with a ﬁvefold symmetry, apparently

with an Ih shape [see Fig. 2(b)]. As the cluster was cooled further to 650 K, the interior

atoms rearranged from these surface facets to form an Ih crystalline structure [see Fig. 2(c)],

which was comparable to an ideal icosahedron, Fig. 2(d).

Structure evolution can also be investigated using diﬀraction patterns. Figure 3 shows
the simulated diﬀraction intensity s3I(s) versus the diﬀraction parameter s for the clusters

at 750 , 700, and 650 K as compared to an ideal Ih cluster, denoted by a dashed line.

The diﬀraction was performed upon relaxed conﬁgurations using the conjugated gradient
method, to exclude the vibrational noise. Note that s3I(s) rather than I(s) was used for

detailed comparisons with the ideal Ih structure [18]. At 750 K, the diﬀraction pattern was

somewhat broadened, due to the liquid state of the cluster [see Fig. 2(a)]. At 700 K, some

peaks started to appear, which represented a disordered structure with short-range order,

Fig. 2(b). At 650 K, ﬁne structures of peaks were found and the overall pattern was similar

to that of the ideal Ih structure.

Next we consider the second case of the freezing curve ‘B’ that appears to be diﬀerent

from the freezing curve ‘A’ [see Fig. 1]. In this case, freezing took place by the advancement

of the solid/liquid interface relatively gradually (over about 200 ps). This is in contrast to

the freezing situation described by curve ‘A’ where freezing took place from a liquid state to

produce a disordered structure abruptly (over about 10 ps). Figures 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)

show cluster conﬁgurations corresponding to the three open square symbols (at 680, 670, and

660 K, respectively) in the freezing curve ‘B’ of Fig. 1. During the initial stage of freezing

[see Fig. 4(a)], facets started to form on the local surface. In the middle stage [see Fig. 4(b)],

more surface facets were formed giving the surface a ﬁvefold symmetry, and crystallization

proceeded from one part of surface to the others. In the ﬁnal stage [see Fig. 4(c)], the entire

cluster was crystallized, although the ﬁnal cluster was not a single crystal but a multiply

According to classical nucleation theory based on the macroscopic concept of the interface

[19, 20], nucleation should take place in the interior of the liquid cluster [21]. In this case, the

stable fcc phase is expected to be formed locally inside the cluster and to ﬁnally grow into a

single crystalline phase. Then, the ﬁnal fcc structure would be energetically more stable than

the Ih structure. However, our MD simulations revealed that the Ih structure is a prevailing

cluster structure, which is in agreement with experimental observations.

Inspections of

the freezing cluster conﬁgurations showed that Ih cluster formation is initiated from surface

ordering not from conventional core nucleation.

In the freezing processes of the melted

6

cluster shown in curve ‘A’ of Fig. 1, surface ordering took place over the entire surface.

Surface ordering induces an abrupt transition from the liquid state to an amorphous state.

Actually, the potential energy of an amorphous cluster with an ordered surface is only slightly

higher than that of the Ih cluster. In the case of the curve ’B’ in Fig. 1, surface ordering

took place only on parts of the local surface. The rest remained in the liquid state, judging

from the fact that as the growing front of the crystallizing surface proceeded, latent heat

continued to be released, as shown in Fig. 1. Our results suggest that low kinetic barriers

at surfaces make cluster formation of the meta-stable Ih skin structure kinetically favorable

(although the energy barriers are not accessible under present MD simulations). Once the

ordered surface facets were formed, they would work as a crystallization seed, and thereby

nano-crystallization would proceed inward, ﬁnally forming the Ih structure.

In our further simulations of diﬀerent cooling rates and cluster sizes up to 1000 atoms,

other structures such as truncated decahedral and fcc were also formed, although the Ih

structure was always dominant. Kinetic competition between these structures seems to be

correlated with the surface ordering of the cluster during freezing, which means that the

reduction of surface energy contributes more eﬀectively than the internal energy in terms

of determining the cluster structure. In many simulation runs, we found that when surface

ordering was dominant, the cluster became Ih. Otherwise, the cluster became t-Dh or fcc.

In our simulations we investigated structural change of clusters during cooling from the

liquid state. Typically, clusters are generated from the gas phase through inert gas con-

densation using adiabatic expansion. Even in this case, if clusters grow as a liquid droplet

and then solidify [22], or if disordered or amorphous clusters are ﬁrst formed and then these

undergo solid-solid transition to nanocrystalline structures, surface ordering of the clusters

might occur and have the same eﬀect as freezing.

In summary, by performing MD simulations on gold clusters, we examined the formation

mechanism of an Ih cluster experimentally observed. When 561-atom gold clusters were

cooled from a liquid state, the Ih structure was obtained repeatedly by two diﬀerent pro-

cesses. In the ﬁrst case, surface ordering with {111}-type facets with a ﬁve-fold symmetry

took place while interior atoms were frozen into a disordered structure abruptly, over about

10 ps. The rearrangement of interior atoms then proceeded inward from the Ih-like surface,

leading to an Ih cluster. In the second case, crystallization took place at a surface region

and then propagated to the whole over about 200 ps. In both cases, the formation of the

7

Ih structure originated from ordered surface facets with a ﬁvefold symmetry. This surface-

induced mechanism explains why clusters tended to adopt an Ih structure, although it is

not energetically the most stable phase.

Abstract

We calculate the two-photon ionization of clusters for photon energies near

the surface plasmon resonance. The results are expressed in terms of the ion-

ization rate of a double plasmon excitation, which is calculated perturbatively.

For the conditions of the experiment by Schlipper et al., [2], we ﬁnd an ion-

ization rate of the order of 0.05-0.10 fs−1. This rate is used to determine the

ionization probability in an external ﬁeld in terms of the number of photons

absorbed and the duration of the ﬁeld. The probability also depends on the

damping rate of the surface plasmon. Agreement with experiment can only

be achieved if the plasmon damping is considerably smaller than its observed

width in the room-temperature single-photon absorption spectrum.

The electromagnetic response of alkali metal clusters shows a very strong surface plasmon

resonance [1], but the interactions of the plasmon with other degrees of freedom are not well

understood. One interesting question is the nonlinearities associated with multiple plasmon

excitations–how weakly do they interact with each other? Some physical processes can

be sensitive to nonlinearities; for example ionization may be energetically impossible for

1

individual plasmons but allowed for states with multiple plasmon excitations and therefore,

ionization rates may depend on the degree of nonlinearity. Recently an experiment was

reported observing the ionization probability with diﬀerent photon ﬁeld durations [2]. The

photon energy was such that ionization is energetically possible only if at least two photons

are absorbed. In this work we ask whether the observed ionization can be interpreted as

electron emission by a two-plasmon state within a simple theory based on the jellium model

of the electronic structure. We will use standard many-body perturbation theory, describing

the surface plasmon in RPA as a particle-hole excitation. The plasmon description and

details of the jellium model are given in Sect. 2 below.

Our calculation may be viewed as a semianalytic approximation to time-dependent local

density approximation (TDLDA), in which the electron dynamics is treated entirely by a

common potential ﬁeld. The TDLDA has been well developed for the high-ﬁeld response of

atoms [3–5], and is now being applied to sodium clusters [6]. Unfortunately, the full TDLDA

is computationally diﬃcult and rather opaque, in contrast to the perturbative approach that

allows important quantities to be calculated directly.

From the point of view of surface plasmon dynamics, a very important quantity is the

ionization rate of a two-plasmon excited state. Haberland et al. [2] interpreted their mea-

surements under the assumption that this rate is fast on a time scale of 10 fs, and we wish

to see whether that can be justiﬁed theoretically. The two-plasmon ionization rate is cal-

culated in Sect. 3. However, the ionization can take place without the mediation of the

plasmon. Also, the plasmon can be excited as a virtual state in which case the connection to

the two-plasmon decay formula is unclear. We present in Sect. 4 a more general treatment

of the ionization process that includes these eﬀects and allows the role of the plasmon to

be isolated from other aspects of the ionization process. The important role of plasmon in

screening and enhancement of the external ﬁeld is made explicit in the formulas discussed

there.

II. THE ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE MODEL

In this section we discuss the Hamiltonian model and the treatment of the surface plas-

mon. We will need single-electron wave functions and energies, which we calculate as follows.

We ﬁrst obtained the solution of the self-consistent jellium model using the computer code

“jellyrpa” [7]. The jellium background charge is assumed to be uniform in a sphere of radius

R = rsN 1/3. Here rs = 3.93 a.u. corresponds to density of charge equal to the bulk density

of atoms in sodium metal. It is more convenient for recreating the wave functions to work

with analytic models of the potential, so we ﬁt the self-consistent jellium potential to a

Woods-Saxon shape. Speciﬁcally, we take the electron potential to be

where Vc(r) is a Coulomb ﬁeld associated with the positive charge distributed uniformly in

the jellium sphere,

The parameters that ﬁt this potential to the self-consistent one are V0 = 5.71 eV, R0 =

10.548 ˚A, and a = 0.635 ˚A. The occupied energy levels of this potential are within 0.2 eV

of the self-consistent potential, which is certainly within the accuracy of the jellium model.

We ﬁnd that the cluster has an ionization potential of 4.5 eV. Under the conditions of the

experiment [2] using photons of 3.1 eV, two photons are required for ionization on energetic

ground. The single-electron spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. We use these orbitals and energies

in the RPA and ionization calculations.

The RPA surface plasmon might also be calculated numerically with the code “jellyrpa”,

but in the interests of developing analytic formulas we adopted a more schematic approach.

We take the interaction between electrons to have a separable form [8],

v(r, r′) = κf(r)

In the spherical jellium model, the surface plasmon can be roughly described taking the

eq.(7) is linear in r whereas TDLDA calculations without separable assumption do not yield

this behavior, as shown in Fig. 2. A simple improvement over the linear form eq. (7) is

the dipole ﬁeld associated with a charge distribution localized on the surface of the jellium

sphere [10]. A surface charge produces a radial ﬁeld of the form

(11)

This is plotted as the dashed line in Fig. 2; it clearly is much closer to the actual TDLDA

transition potential. With this choice, the empirical position of the resonance is obtained

by using the coupling κ = 0.6κc. This is very close to the previous one, showing that the

modiﬁed form factor has only a small inﬂuence on the plasmon properties. We will see that

it is much more important in the ionization process.

In the experimental photoabsorption spectrum, the plasmon has a width of about 0.5 eV.

This ﬁnite width requires theory beyond RPA, which produces only zero-width excitations

below the ionization threshold. Since it is not easy to incorporate the other degrees of

freedom that are responsible for the width, we will treat the width phenomenologically. In

discussing the response in general, it is useful to consider the dynamic polarizability α(ω).

Applying this to the experimental data of ref. [11], we ﬁnd the imaginary part of α graphed as

the solid line in Fig. 3. This is compared with the single-pole approximation with parameters

ωn = 2.75 eV and Γn = 0.5 eV. A modiﬁcation of the jellium model was proposed in ref.

[12] introducing a soft-edged surface in the distribution of the background charge. We

also calculated the full RPA response for soft jellium model, calculated using the program

“jellyrpa”.

In this case the empirical width can be reproduced with a smaller external

width parameter. The dashed line shows the ﬁt with Γn = 0.3 eV. Both these models give

a reasonable but not quantitative description of the data. The soft jellium model has the

advantage that the plasmon can be moved to lower frequency without adjusting the coupling

strength. However, it predicts too low an ionization potential, which makes it unsuitable

for the autoionization calculation.

The corresponding comparison for the real part of α is shown in Fig. (4). Here the theory

is quite robust, and we can rather conﬁdently estimate Re α at the energy of interest (3.1

eV) to be about 3000 ˚A3.

III. TWO-PLASMON AUTOIONIZATION RATE

the two-plasmon excitation of the nµ mode and the ﬁnal conﬁguration with a hole h and

the electron in a continuum state p , is shown in Fig. 5. The labels p′, h′ stand for particle

The factor of 2 arises from the two-fold spin degeneracy of the occupied orbitals. In carrying

out the calculation one also has to ﬁx the normalization of the continuum radial wave

function. A convenient choice is rϕp →

sin(kr + δ) at large r, giving dnp/dE = 2m/(πk¯h2).

The results for the autoionization of Na+

93 are given in Table I. We chose the plasmon

parameter κ in two diﬀerent ways, requiring the plasmon resonance energy ωn to be either at

the experimental position of 2.75 eV, or at the energy of the absorbed photons, 3.1 eV. The

particle-hole states taken into account in the calculations include electron jumps up to three

harmonic oscillator shells. We ﬁrst discuss the results in the case of undamped excitations

(δ = 0 in Table I). The upper half of Table I shows the values obtained using the linear

dipole ﬁeld f0 = z (eq. (7)). The resulting widths Γe are extremely small for both choices

of ωn, and they would be hard to reconcile with experiment. This led us to reexamine our

simplifying assumption about the shape of the separable particle-hole interaction. Since the

choice of eq. (10) gives a better transition potential (see ﬁg. 2) we use it from now on instead

of eq. (7). As shown in the lower half of Table I, the resulting widths are much larger and

they seem to give a possibility to explain the data. Indeed, they correspond to ionization

times of the order of 5.5 fs to 7.5 fs which is comparable to the estimated plasmon lifetime

of 10 fs [2].

However, the calculated results cannot be considered reliable because they are quite

sensitive to the single-particle energies involved in the transition. In eq. (16) several states

i′ give quite small energy denominators (see Fig. 1) and therefore they yield abnormally

large contributions. However, it is not consistent to neglect the damping of the excitations

in the perturbative calculation when the energy denominators are small. As we did with

the plasmon in Sect. 2, we here add a ﬁnite imaginary term δ to the energy denominators of

eq. (16). In Fig. 6 we show the dependence of

2 on δ which is seen to be moderate

for δ in the range 0.1 - 0.2 eV. We see that the damping reduces the ionization width by

roughly a factor of two when δ = 0.1 eV which seems a reasonable value. Although the

dependence on the transition ﬁeld and on the damping makes the calculation uncertain by

a factor of two or so, we at least see that the result is rather insensitive to the particular

model for the plasmon excitation energy. This is nice in that it means that the theoretical

uncertainty here is not a hindrance to doing the calculation.

The results correspond to a ionization lifetime τe of the two-plasmon state in the range of

5 to 10 fs. This is of the same order of magnitude as the plasmon lifetime which is estimated

to be about 10 fs [2]. In the present model the ionization process is not very fast contrarily

to the assumption made in the interpretation of ref. [2], but it is fast enough to allow for

the ionization process to compete with the plasmon damping.

IV. IONIZATION IN A LASER FIELD

In this section we wish to apply the previous results to ionization in a laser ﬁeld. Thus,

we consider the ionization as a multistep process, in which the photons are ﬁrst absorbed

to make plasmons and then the plasmons interact to eject an electron. A simple physical

argument can be made to obtain a formula for the ionization, which we will then justify

more formally. Let us deﬁne the absorption rate for photons Rν and the damping width

for the plasmon Γn. In the steady state the balance between the creation and absorption of

plasmons gives a mean number of plasmons ¯n satisfying

Taking the distribution of numbers as Poissonian, the mean number of pairs is then ¯n2/2.

The ionization rate Re is related to the two-plasmon ionization width Γe by

(20)

(21)

where Γe and we have been introduced in the preceding section.

A more formal derivation of this formula may be made from the graph of Fig. 5 as

follows. We add to the graph matrix elements of the external ﬁeld between the zero- and

one-plasmon states,

The plasmon propagator itself can be approximated by 1/(

Eq. (21) may now be obtained by combining the last two equations.

For comparing with experiment, it is convenient to express eq. (21) in terms of the number

of ionizations per cluster Ne = ReT and the number of photons absorbed Nν = RνT , where

T is the time duration of the laser pulse. We obtain for Ne

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

The experiment [2] observed not only ionization but considerable evaporation of atoms

from the clusters. We note that atomic motion takes place on a much longer time scale

than electronic motion. Most of the evaporated particles are emitted from the cluster after

it has reached thermal equilibrium; the statistical evaporation theory gives lifetimes in the

nanosecond regime for the conditions of the experiment [15]. This is longer than the fast

laser pulse duration (T = 140 fs), so we may think that the Na+

93 cluster remains whole

before being ionized. The ﬁrst line of eq. (25) may be estimated from Fig. 2 of ref. [2]. The

broad peak in the middle of the mass spectrum represents ionized clusters and has roughly

1/3. The number of photons

To evaluate the second line of eq. (25) we have the calculated Γe from Sect. 3 and the

experimental pulse duration T , but we still do not have Γn, the damping width of the

plasmon. As discussed in Sect. 2, this quantity is beyond the scope of RPA, but an upper

bound to Γn is given by the empirical photoabsorption spectrum. Taking the values ωn=2.75

eV and Γn = 0.5 eV the single-pole ﬁt to the plasmon and δ = 0.2 eV in the perturbative

energy denominators, we ﬁnd Pe = 1.0

10−3, which is much too small. On the other

×

hand, the experimentally quoted lifetime of the plasmon is 10 fs which corresponds to a

considerably smaller value of Γn. Adopting this value of Γn gives Pe = 5.8

10−2. The

×

width Γe depends on the particular cluster considered since the energetics of the emitted

electrons will change somewhat for diﬀerent clusters.

V. GENERAL THEORY

The theory in the last section assumed that the energy transfer to the electron was

indirect, ﬁrst producing plasmons which then autoionize. In fact the photon could be ab-

sorbed directly on the electron. The direct absorption is implicit in the TDLDA, and can be

taken into account as well in the perturbative theory of photon absorption [16]. The general

expression for a second-order transition from a state i to f is given by

The second order matrix element Kf i is similar to eq. (16) with the linear ﬁeld (7), except

the particle orbitals are replaced by many-body states i, i′, f :

Eq. (23) can now be obtained from eq. (29) by dropping the external ﬁeld contribution as well

as the nonresonant term in the polarizability. In the second line, we express the polarization

eﬀects as a multiplicative factor, which can be interpreted as an eﬀective charge

We may use this expression to assess the relative importance of the external and induced

ﬁelds. First note that there is a complete cancelation of the two terms in eq. (30), implying

complete screening, if we take κ = κc and α = R3. This last is just the classical polarizability

of a conducting sphere, and it may also be derived putting the Mie resonance eq. (9) into

the polarizability formula eq. (11).

For the present purposes we assume in eq. (29) ωn = 2.75 eV and κ = 0.52κc as in Sec. 2.

We also take for Γn a width corresponding to a lifetime of 10 fs. The result at ω = 3.1 eV is

Thus the plasmon enhances the ﬁeld approximately by a factor of 4.3, showing that the

induced ﬁeld is indeed dominant. This result is insensitive to Γn if it is small, but would

decrease if the width were as large as the measured width of the optical absorption peak. In

a study of Na+

9 in the TDLDA, ref. [17] obtained enhancement factors on resonance in the

range 5-8, which is the same order of magnitude.

The eﬀect on the ionization rate goes as the fourth power of the ﬁeld,

Finally , we use this result to make an improved calculation of the ionization probability Pe

introduced in eq. (25). The number of emitted electrons is calculated as Ne = wf iT where

wf i is given by eq. (26) with e replaced by eef f . The number of of pairs of absorbed photons

is given by Npair = (IσT )2/2, σ being the photo-absorption cross section. Computing σ from

eq. (12) we ﬁnd Pe = 1.25

10−2, a magnitude comparable to that found in the preceding

×

section. However, the cross section corresponding to the polarizability in eq. (31) is much

too small at 3.1 eV, as is clear from the width discussion in Sect. 2. On the other hand,

if we take the width parameter from empirical single-pole ﬁt, Γn = 0.5 eV, the probability

comes out very small, as discussed earlier.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have derived the theory of cluster ionization by multiple photons of fre-

quency near that of the surface plasmon. The weak coupling between the surface plasmons is

the driving interaction for the two-photon ionization process, and a perturbative framework

with respect to the ionized electron seems reasonable. The plasmon-induced mechanism

can be derived from the general perturbative formula using the higher order contributions

associated with the screened interaction. Unfortunately, the formula depends quadratically

on the damping rate of the plasmon, which is still not fully understood. The rates obtained

for Na+

93 are of the order of tens of femtoseconds, which is the same time scale as other

relaxation processes.

13

We have used the jellium model in the calculations, and it is unclear how realistic the

model is. We found that the interaction must be treated more accurately than in the small-

r separable approximation, but we have not examined the most sophisticated treatment of

the interaction which would include the exchange interaction without approximation. The

Landau damping of the Mie resonance is much larger with more realistic interactions [18].

A major problem of the jellium model is that the damping is too small. Ionic scattering

(called ”interband transitions” in condensed matter physics) would increase the spreading

width, and the lack of ionic scattering in the jellium model is in general a serious deﬁciency.

However, in the case of Na clusters the realistic Hamiltonian gives a very similar spectrum to

the jellium model [19], giving some credibility to the model. Nevertheless, it would be inter-

esting to see what the eﬀects of the ionic scattering are in the second-order ionization. For

small Na clusters, more realistic calculations are becoming available of high ﬁeld ionization

using the TDLDA [20], and it would be interesting to compare.

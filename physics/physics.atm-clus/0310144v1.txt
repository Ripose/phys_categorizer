In this paper we propose a tight-binding molecular dynamics with parameters ﬁtted to ﬁrst-
principles calculations on the smaller clusters and with an environment correction, to be a powerful
technique for studying large transition/noble metal clusters. In particular, the structure and stability
of Cun clusters for n = 3−55 are studied by using this technique. The results for small Cun clusters
(n = 3 − 9) show good agreement with ab initio calculations and available experimental results. In
the size range 10 ≤ n ≤ 55 most of the clusters adopt icosahedral structure which can be derived
from the 13-atom icosahedron, the polyicosahedral 19-, 23-, and 26-atom clusters and the 55-atom
icosahedron, by adding or removing atoms. However, a local geometrical change from icosahedral
to decahedral structure is observed for n = 40 − 44 and return to the icosahedral growth pattern is
found at n = 45 which continues. Electronic “magic numbers” (n = 2, 8, 20, 34, 40) in this regime
are correctly reproduced. Due to electron pairing in HOMOs, even-odd alternation is found. A
sudden loss of even-odd alternation in second diﬀerence of cluster binding energy, HOMO-LUMO
gap energy and ionization potential is observed in the region n ∼ 40 due to structural change there.
Interplay between electronic and geometrical structure is found.

INTRODUCTION

The study of clusters has become an increasingly in-
teresting topic of research in both physics and chemistry
in recent years, since they span the gap between the mi-
croscopic and macroscopic materials [1, 2]. Metallic clus-
ters play a central role in catalysis [3, 4, 5, 6] and nan-
otechnology [7, 8, 9]. Cluaters of coinage metals Cu, Ag
and Au have been used in a wide range of demonstra-
tion [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The determination of struc-
tural and electronic properties and the growth pattern of
coinage metal clusters are of much interest both experi-
mentally [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and theoret-
ically [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The electronic conﬁgura-
tion of the coinage metals are characterized by a closed d
shell and a single s valance electron [Cu : Ar(3d)10(4s)1,
Ag : Kr(4d)10(5s)1, Au : Xe(5d)10(6s)1]. Due to the
presence of single s electrons in the atomic outer shells,
the noble metal clusters are expected to exhibit certain
similarities to the alkali metal clusters. Electronic struc-
ture of alkali metal clusters are well described by the
spherical shell model, which has successfully interpreted
the “magic numbers” in N an and Kn clusters [1, 2]. A
number of experimental features of noble metal clusters
are also qualitatively well described in terms of simple s
electron shell model. For instance, the mass abundance

spectrum of Cu−
n and Au−
n clusters, which reﬂects
the stability of clusters, can be explained by the one-
electron shell model [10]. But some experimental studies
[11, 12, 13, 14] indicate that the localized d electrons of
the noble metals play a signiﬁcant role for the geomet-
rical and electronic structure through the hybridization
with more extended valence s electron . Therefore, it is
important to include the contribution of 3d electrons and
the s − d hybridization for Cun clusters.

Bare copper clusters in the gas phase have been stud-
ied experimentally by Taylor et al.
[15] and Ho et al.
[16] using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). Knickel-
bein measured ionization potentials of neutral copper
clusters and found evidence of electronic shell struc-
ture [17]. Very recently cationic copper clusters have
been studied using threshold collision-induced dissocia-
tion (TCID) by Spasov et al. [18]. Copper clusters have
been also investigated theoretically by various accurate
quantum mechanical and chemical approaches. Masso-
brio et al.
[19] studied the structures and energetics of
Cun (n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10) within the local density ap-
proximation of density functional theory (DF-LDA) by
using the Car Parinello (CP) method. Calaminici et
al.
[20] used the linear combination of Gaussian-type
orbitals density functional (LCGTO-DFT) approach to
study Cun, Cu−
n clusters with n ≤ 5. Akeby et
al.
[21] used the conﬁguration interaction (CI) method
In
with an eﬀective core potential (ECP) for n ≤ 10.
an earlier communication [22] we studied the small Cun
clusters for n ≤ 9 by using full-potential muﬃn-tin or-
bitals (FP-LMTO) technique.

n and Cu+

Ideally, the sophisticated, quantum chemistry based,
ﬁrst-principles methods predict both the stable geome-
tries and energetics to a very high degree of accuracy.
The practical problem arises from the fact that for ac-
tual implementation these techniques are limited to small
clusters only. None of the methods described above
can be implemented for clusters much larger than ∼
10 atoms, because of prohibitive computational expense.
The aim of this communication is to introduce an semi-
empirical method, which nevertheless retains some of the
electronic structure features of the problem. The empir-
ical parameters are determined from ﬁrst-principles cal-
culations for small clusters, and corrections introduced
for local environmental corrections in the larger clusters.
In recent years empirical tight-binding molecular dy-
namics (TB-MD) method has been developed as an al-
ternative to ab initio methods. As compared with ab
initio methods, the parameterized tight-binding Hamil-
tonian reduces the computational cost dramatically. The
main problem with the empirical tight-binding methods
has always been the lack of transferability of its empiri-
cal parameters. We shall describe here a technique that
allows us to ﬁt the parameters of the model from a fully
ab initio, self-consistent local spin-density approximation
(LSDA) based FP-LMTO calculation reported earlier by
us [22, 23] for the smaller clusters and then make cor-
rection for the new environment for clusters in order to
ensure transferability (at least to a degree).

It should be mentioned here that Copper clusters
have also been investigated by other empirical methods.
D’Agostino carried molecular dynamics using a quasi-
empirical potential derived from a tight-binding approach
for nearly 1300 atoms [24]. More recently Darby et al.
carried geometry optimization by genetic algorithm us-
ing Gupta potential [25] for Cun, Aun and their alloy
clusters in the size range n ≤ 56 [26]. These kinds of
empirical atomistic potentials are found to be good to
predict ground state geometries but can not predict elec-
tronic properties such as electronic shell closing eﬀect for
n =2, 8, 20, 40, ..., highest occupied-lowest unoccupied
molecular level (HOMO-LUMO) gap energy and ioniza-
tion potential. Our proposed TBMD scheme will allow
us to extrapolate to the larger clusters to study both the
ground state geometries as well as ground state energetics
as a function of cluster size.

Menon et al. have proposed a minimal parameter
tight-binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) scheme for
semiconductors [27, 28, 29] and extended the method for
transition metal (N in and F en) clusters [30, 31]. Re-
cently Zhao et al. has applied this method for silver
clusters [32]. In the present work, we shall introduce a
similar TB model for copper.

Using this TBMD method, we shall investigate the
stable structures, cohesive energies, relative stabilities,
HOMO-LUMO gaps and ionization potentials of Cun
clusters in the size range n ≤ 55. We shall indicate the
comparison between the present results for small clusters,
n ≤ 9, with those of our previous FP-LMTO calculations

and other ab initio and available experimental results.
This is essential before we go over to the computation-
ally expensive study of larger clusters.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

Menon et al.

introduced a minimal parameter tight-
binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) scheme for tran-
sition metal clusters [30, 31]. Here we will describe the
main ingredients. In this tight-binding scheme the total
energy E is written as a sum,

E = Eel + Erep + Ebond.

(1)

Eel is the sum of the one-electron energies for the occu-
pied states ǫk,

Eel =

ǫk,

X

H|Ψki = ǫk|Ψki,

where the energy eigenvalues ǫk are calculated by solving
the eigenvalue equation

where H is the one-electron Hamiltonian and |Ψki is
electronic wave function for kth level of the eigenstate.
In the TB formulation, the single particle wavefunc-
tions |Ψki are cast as a linear combination of orthog-
onalized basis functions Φiν , in the minimum basis set
(ν = s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2−y2, d3z2−r2),

|Ψki =

where i labels the ions.

The TB Hamiltonian H is constructed within Slater-
Koster scheme [33], where the diagonal matrix elements
are taken to be conﬁguration independent and the oﬀ-
diagonal matrix elements are taken to have Slater-Koster
type angular dependence with respect to the inter-atomic
separation vector r and scaled exponentially with the
inter-atomic separation r:

copper, S(l, m, n) is the Slater-Koster type function of
the direction cosines l, m, n of the separation vector r
and α is an adjustable parameter (= 2/d) [31].

eter rd, the on-site energies Es, Ep, Ed and the universal
,µ for Cu [34]. According to Ref.[30] and
constants ηλ,λ
Ref.[31], we set Es = Ed and Ep large enough to prevent
p-orbital mixing [34]. This choice of our tight-binding
parameters reproduces the band structure of the fcc bulk
Cu crystal given by Harrison [34].

The repulsive energy Erep is described by a sum of
short-ranged repulsive pair potentials, φij , which scaled
exponentially with inter-atomic distance,

Erep =

φij (rij )

where rij is the separation between the atom i and j and
β(= 4α) is a parameter. Erep contains ion-ion repulsive
interaction and correction to the double counting of the
electron-electron repulsion present in Eel. The value of
φ0 is ﬁtted to reproduce the correct experimental bond
length of the Cu dimer 2.22 ˚A [35] is given in TableII.

The ﬁrst two terms of the total energy are not suﬃcient
to exactly reproduce cohesive energies of dimers through
bulk structures. Toma`nek and Schluter [36] introduced
a coordination dependent correction term, Ebond, to the
total energy, which does not contribute to the force, it is
added to the total energy after the relaxation has been
achieved. However, for the metal clusters, this correction
term is signiﬁcant in distinguishing various isomers for a
given cluster [31].

diﬀerent sizes according to the following equation

Ebond = Eab initio − Eel − Erep.

(10)

Thus we have four parameters φ0, a, b, and c in this
TB model. These parameters are once calculated (given
in the Table II) for small clusters to reproduce known
results (whatever experimental or theoretical) and then
kept ﬁxed for other arbitrary size cluster. To determine
the parameters a, b and c we use the experimental bind-
ing energy of Cu dimer 1.03 eV/atom [35] and the ab
initio FP-LMTO results for Cu4 and Cu6 in Ref.
[22].
For the Cu2 dimer calculated vibrational frequency (226
cm−1) has reasonable agreement with experiment [37]
(265 cm−1).

In molecular dynamics scheme the trajectories {Rj(t)}
of the ions are determined by the potential energy sur-
face E[{Rj(t)}] corresponding to the total energy of the
electronic system. The force acting on the i-th ion is thus
given by,

Fi = −∇Ri E[{Rj}]

The second term in the above equation is the short-
ranged repulsive force. We should note that Pulay cor-
rection term does not play any role in any semi-empirical
TBMD [39]. The reason is twofold. Within TBMD we
directly compute the derivative of the TB Hamiltonian
matrix element and the basis wavefunctions never ap-
pear explicitely, rather they are implicitely contained in
the ﬁtted matrix entries.

(15)

At this stage most authors carry out either dissipative
dynamics or free dynamics with feedback [41]. The rea-
son for this is as follows :
for numerical integration of
Newton’s equations we have to choose a ﬁnite time-step
δt. Ideally this should be as small as possible, but that
would require an excessively long time for locating the
global minimum. However, a large choice of δt leads to
unphysical heating up of the system, leading to instabil-
ity. Dissipative dynamics has been suggested as a way
of overcoming this. We add a small extra friction term
carefully F ⇒ F − γm ˙R [31]. In the present calculation
γm = 0.32 amu/psec, and the time step δt is taken to
be 1 fsec and the total time for molecular dynamics sim-
ulation is ∼ 100 - 200 psec, depending upon the cluster
size and initial cluster conﬁguration with the several an-
nealing schedule. Methfessel and Schilfgaarde [41] have
also used an alternative technique of free dynamics with
feedback to overcome the above diﬃculty.

The results of the molecular dynamics may depend sen-
sitively on the starting conﬁguration chosen. The ﬁnal

equilibrium conﬁgurations often correspond to local min-
ima of the total energy surface and are metastable states.
For the smaller clusters simulated annealing can lead to
the global minimum. We have found the global mini-
mum conﬁgurations of the smaller clusters by the simu-
lated annealing technique. However, this is often not the
case for the larger clusters. Recently more sophisticated
techniques like the genetic algorithm has been proposed
[42]-[45]. We have not tried this out in this communica-
tion, but propose this as an eﬃcient technique for further
work.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Geometry optimization

We have applied this TBMD scheme to Cun clusters
for n ≤ 55. Since the present scheme imposes no a priori
symmetry restrictions, we can perform full optimization
of cluster geometries. For small clusters (n ≤ 9) we can
able to perform a full conﬁgurational space search to de-
termine the lowest-energy conﬁguration. Here they serve
as a test case for the calculation of larger clusters with

FIG. 1: Most stable structures for copper clusters with n = 10 − 55 atoms. Most of the clusters adopt icosahedral structures
except for n = 40 − 44, where the structures are decahedral.

n ≥ 10. In Table III we present a detailed comparison
of binding energy per atom, diﬀerence in binding energy
△E and average bond length hri for n ≤ 9 with available
experimental [18] and ab initio [19, 21, 22] results. We

found, in agreement with experimental [16] and theoret-
ical [19, 20, 21] results, very small copper clusters (Cu3,
Cu4 and Cu5) prefer planer structures. More detailed
comparison, with experimental and ab initio results, can

be found elsewhere [46].

From the present results and detailed comparisons with
various experimental [16, 18] and ab initio [19, 20, 21, 22,
47, 48, 49] results available, we ﬁnd reasonable agreement
among this TBMD scheme and ab initio calculations for
small clusters with n ≤ 9 [46], which allow us to con-
tinue the use of this TBMD scheme for larger clusters
with n ≥ 10. For larger clusters (10 ≤ n ≤ 55), due
to increasing degrees of freedom with cluster size, a full
conﬁgurational search is not possible with the available
computational resources. Instead, led by the experimen-
tal and theoretical results on small clusters, we examined
structures of various symmetries for each size. Most sta-
ble structures for n = 10 − 55 atom clusters are given in
Fig.1.

In this regime, the structures predicted by this TB
model are mainly based on icosahedron. The most sta-
ble structure of Cu7 is a pentagonal bipyramid (D5h
symmetry; see TableIII), which is the building block for
the larger clusters with n ≥ 10. For Cu10, we found a
tricapped pentagonal bipyramid to be the most stable
structure. Ground state structures of Cu11 and Cu12
are the uncompleted icosahedron with lack of one and
two atoms respectively and a Jahn-Teller distorted ﬁrst
closed shell icosahedron is formed at Cu13. For Cu13, the
fcc like cuboctahedron is less stable than the icosahedron
by an energy 0.05 eV per atom. In agreement Lammers
and Borstel, on the basis of tight-binding linear muﬃn-
tin orbital calculations, was also found the icosahedron
to be the ground state of Cu13, though the diﬀerence
in energy between the icosahedron and the cuboctahe-
dron was calculated to be only 0.2 eV/atom [48]. The
ground state structures for Cu14, Cu15, Cu16, and Cu17
are the 13- atom icosahedron plus one, two, three and
four atoms respectively. A double icosahedron is formed
for Cu19 (D5h symmetry). This structure has two inter-
nal atoms, 12 six-coordinate atoms at either end and ﬁve
eight-coordinate atoms around the waist of the cluster.
Based on the structure for Cu19, the stable Cu18 cluster
is a double icosahedron minus one of the six-coordinate
atoms located at either end (C5v symmetry).
Icosahe-
dral growth continues for 20 ≤ n ≤ 55 atom clusters.
Polyicosahedral structure in the form of a “ triple icosa-
hedron” (D3h symmetry; the structure can be viewed
as three interpenetrating double icosahedra) is the most
stable structure for Cu23 cluster. The next closed shell
polyicosahedra is found for Cu26 cluster. Finally, the
second closed shell icosahedron is formed for Cu55 which
is more stable than the closed cuboctahedral structure
by an energy diﬀerence 6.27 eV. This can be explained
in terms of their surface energy. The surface energy
of the icosahedral structure is lower than that of the
cuboctahedral structure, because the atoms on the sur-
face of the icosahedron are ﬁve-coordinate compared to
the four-coordinate atoms on the surface of the cuboc-
tahedron. In our calculation, exception to the icosahe-
dral growth is found at around Cu40. The situation re-
garding geometrical structure in this size range is more

6

complex. The structures for n = 40 − 44 atom clus-
ters are oblate, decahedron like geometries. Return to
the icosahedral structure is found at n = 45. In the size
range n = 40−44, the structural sequence is decahedron-
icosahedron-cuboctahedron in decreasing order of stabil-
ity, whereas in the region n = 45 − 55, the structures
retain icosahedron-decahedron-cuboctahedron sequence.

This results are in agreement with the experimental
study of Winter and co-workers [50], where they found
a bare copper cluster mass spectrum recorded with ArF
laser ionization shows a sudden decrease in the ion sig-
nal at Cu+
42, and from this observation they argued that
a change in geometrical structure might occur there,
though they have not concluded about the nature of this
geometrical change. They also found a dramatic decrease
in water binding energy for Cu50 and Cu51, and con-
cluded that this may represent a return to the icosahedral
structure as the closed shell at Cu55 is approached.

D’Agostino [24] conﬁrms our prediction, who per-
formed molecular dynamics using a tight-binding many-
body potential and found that icosahedral structures are
prevalent for clusters containing less than about 1500
atoms. Valkealahti and Manninen [51], using eﬀective
medium theory, also found icosahedral structures are en-
ergetically more favourable than the cuboctahedral struc-
tures for sizes up to n ∼ 2500 is consistent with our re-
sult: Fig.3 shows cuboctahedral structures are least sta-
ble among the three structures, icosahedron, decahedron
and cuboctahedron. By contrast, Christensen and Ja-
cobsen [52] predicted more fcc-like structures in the size
range n = 3 − 29, in their Monte Carlo simulation us-
ing an eﬀective medium potential. But they correctly
reproduced the “magic numbers” in that regime [52, 53].

These results can be compared with the genetic algo-
rithm study on copper clusters by Darby et al. [26], using
Gupta potential. In agreement with the present study,
Darby et al. found that most of the clusters in this regime
adopt structures based on icosahedron. They also found
exceptions to the icosahedral growth at around Cu40,
where the structures adopt decahedron like geometries
(exact numbers are not available in the Ref.[26]). But the
present study disagree with the genetic algorithm study
in two points. Firstly, for 25 atom cluster, they found a
more disordered structure, while the present study pre-
dict it to be an icosahedron based structure which can
be derived by removing one surface atom from the 26-
atom polyicosahedron. Finally, they found an fcc-like
truncated octahedral structure for Cu38.
Instead, the
present study predict the icosahedron based structure to
be the ground state, where this structure is energetically
more favourable than the truncated octahedral structure
by an energy △E = 0.17 eV/atom. Although the ge-
netic algorithm search for global minima is more eﬃcient
technique than molecular dynamics, use of the empirical
atomistic potential is the main reason [54] for this kind
of disagreement between Darby et al. and the present
study.

B. Binding energies and relative stabilities

The computed size dependence of the binding energy
per atom for Cun clusters with n = 2 − 55 is depicted
in Fig.2 (upper panel). Among all the isomeric geome-
tries examined for a certain cluster size n, the highest
cohesive energy has been considered for the Fig.2. The
overall shape of the curve matches the anticipated trend:
binding energy grows monotonically with increasing the
cluster size. Inset of the Fig.2 (upper panel) shows the
comparison of our calculated binding energy with the ab
initio [19, 22] and experimental [18] results. Experimen-
tally the binding energies of the neutral clusters were
derived from the dissociation energy data of anionic clus-
ters from the TCID experiment [18] and using electron
aﬃnities from the PES experiment [16]. The inset ﬁgure
shows that our calculated binding energies are in good
agreement with those from DF-LDA [19] and our previ-
ous FP-LMTO [22] calculations. However, our binding
energies are systematically overestimated, by an energy
0.53 ± 0.12 to 0.79 ± 0.22, than the experimental bind-
ing energies. The LDA based ab initio calculations al-

Cluster Size n

FIG. 3: Comparison of binding energies per atom as a func-

icosahedral structures. For the whole region most of the clus-
ters prefer icosahedral structure. However, a local geometrical

ways over-estimate binding energies. This is a character-
istic of the LDA. In the present study, TB parameters
have been ﬁtted to the ab initio LDA calculations for
very small calculations [22]. It is not surprising therefore
that the binding energies are over-estimated.
In fact,
the present results agree well with other LDA based cal-
culations [19, 22], all of which overestimate the binding
energy.

In the Fig.3, we compared binding energy per atom
for cuboctahedral, decahedral and icosahedral structures
for the clusters containing n = 30 − 55 atoms. Fig.3
shows most the clusters in this size range have icosa-
hedral structures. However, a local structural change
occured for n = 40 − 44, where the structures adopt dec-
ahedral structure rather than icosahedral one. Return
to the icosahedral growth pattern is found at n = 45
and continues up to 55-atom cluster. From the Fig.3 it is
clear that among cuboctahedral, decahedral and icosahe-
dral structures, cuboctahedral structures are least stable
than the other two.

The second diﬀerence in the binding energy may be

calculated as

△2E(n) = E(n + 1) + E(n − 1) − 2E(n),

(16)

where E(n) represents the total energy for an n-atom
cluster. △2E(n) represents the relative stability of an n-
atom cluster with respect to its neighbors and can be di-
rectly compared to the experimental relative abundance
: the peaks in △2E(n) coincide with the discontinuities
in the mass spectra. These are plotted in the lower panel
of Fig.2. We found three major characteristics in the
Fig.2 (lower panel ). Firstly, even-odd (even > odd)
oscillation is found. This can be explained in terms of
electron pairing in HOMOs. Even (odd) clusters have an
even (odd) number of electrons and the HOMO is dou-
bly (singly) occupied. The electron in a doubly occupied
HOMO will feel a stronger eﬀective core potential be-

cause the electron screening is weaker for the electrons
in the same orbital than for inner shell electrons. Thus
the binding energy of the valence electron with an even
cluster is larger than of an odd one. This even-odd al-
ternation is prominent up to n ∼ 40. Secondly, due to
electronic shell or subshell closing, we found particular
high peak for n = 8, 18, 20, 34 and 40. Unfortunately,
the present study does not show any evidence of shell
closing for Cu2 in △2E(n). Finally, the even-odd al-
ternation is reversed for n = 10 − 16 with maxima at
Cu11, Cu13 and Cu15, which manifests the geometrical
eﬀect and therefore there is no peak at n = 14 due to
electronic subshell closing. Simultaneous appearance of
these three features in △2E(n) demonstrates the inter-
play between electronic and geometrical structure, which
is in agreement with the experimental study of Winter
et al.
[50]. They found both jellium-like electronic be-
haviour and icosahedral structure in copper clusters. In
an experimental study of mass spectra of ionized copper
clusters [10], substantial discontinuities in mass spectra
at n = 3, 9, 21, 35, 41 for cationic and n = 7, 19, 33, 39 for
anionic clusters as well as dramatic even-odd alternation
are found. From the sudden loss in the even-odd alterna-
tion at Cu42 in the KrCl spectrum, Winter et al. argued
about the possible geometrical change there. Therefore,
we conclude in the section that sudden loss in the △2E vs
n plot (lower panel of Fig.2) is due the structural change
in that regime.

Such kind of electronic eﬀects can not be reproduced
by empirical atomistic potentials. Darby et al. [26], us-
ing the Gupta potential, found signiﬁcant peaks at n =
7, 13, 19, 23 and 55 due to icosahedral (or polyicosahe-
In the present study, we have found

a peak at n = 13, but not at the other sizes found by
them. However, the stable structures predicted by us
are the same : the lowest energy structure of Cu7 is a
pentagonal bipyramid (D5h symmetry) ; for n = 13 and
55, the structure are the ﬁrst and second closed icosahe-
dral geometries respectively. Polyicosahedral structures
are found for n = 19 (double icosahedron) and n = 23
(triple icosahedron) atom clusters. As the reason, the
present study shows signiﬁcant high peaks at Cu8, Cu18
and Cu20 due to electronic shell closing eﬀect and av-
erage peaks at Cu22 and Cu24 due to electron pairing
eﬀect. At these sizes, the electronic eﬀects dominates
over the geometrical eﬀects and consequently the above
peaks cannot observed by Darby et. al..

C. HOMO-LUMO gap energies

Besides the second diﬀerence of the cluster binding
energy, a sensitive quantity to probe the stability is
the highest occupied-lowest unoccupied molecular level
(HOMO-LUMO) gap energy. In the case of magic clus-
ters shell or subshell closer manifests themselves in par-
ticularly large HOMO-LUMO gap, which was previ-
ously demonstrated experimentally [16, 55]. Calculated

shell closer at n = 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40 and even-odd alternation
are observed. However, sudden loss in even-odd alternation
is found around n ∼ 40 due to the structural change there.

HOMO-LUMO gap energies are plotted in the Fig.4,
where we observed even-odd alternation due to electron
pairing eﬀect and particularly large gap for n = 2, 8,
18, 20, 34 and 40 due to electronic shell and subshell
closing. However, sudden loss of even-odd alternation is
found around n ∼ 40 due to the change in the geometrical
structure in that region. Winter et al. [50] also found a
sudden loss in even-odd alternation in the KrCl spectrum
at Cu42 and concluded this may coincide with any pos-
sible change in the geometrical structure there. In fact,
Katakuse et al.
[10] observed identical behaviour in the
mass spectra of sputtered copped and silver cluster ions :
a dramatic loss of even-odd alternation at n = 42, signi-
fying a sudden change to a geometrical structure in which
stability, and abundance, is less sensitive to electron pair-
ing. Therefore, the sudden loss in the Fig.4 again con-
ﬁrms the structural change there. So, the present study
correctly predicts the “magic numbers” in this regime
correctly and conﬁrms the experimental prediction : a
geometrical change (icosahedron → decahedron) is oc-
curring around n ∼ 40.

D.

Ionization potentials

Within the present TB scheme, we can get a ‘quali-
tative’ description of the ionization potentials with clus-
ter size according to Koopmans’ theorem. This limita-
tion arises mainly from the choice of the Slater-Koster
(SK) TB parameters and the extent of their transferabil-
ity [56], which may be improved by the proposed scaling
scheme of Cohen, Mehl and Papaconstantopoulos [57] .
However, our aim is to get only a qualitative description
of ionization potential with cluster size. Calculated ion-
ization potentials are plotted in the Fig.5.
In fact, we
observed same pattern as it was in HOMO-LUMO gap
energy vs cluster size : peaks at n = 2, 8, 18, 20, 34,

there.

IV. CONCLUSION

Using tight-binding model we calculated ground state
geometries, binding energies, second diﬀerences in bind-
ing energy, HOMO-LUMO gap energies and ionization
potentials for copper clusters in the size range 2 ≤
n ≤ 55. We have ﬁtted the parameters of the present
TB scheme from our previous ab inito calculations [22].
For small clusters n ≤ 9, present results show good
agreement with experimental [16, 18] and theoretical
[19, 20, 21, 22, 47, 48, 49] results, which allow us to
go over the larger size range, 10 ≤ n ≤ 55.

In the size range 10 ≤ n ≤ 55 most of the clus-
ters adopt icosahedral geometry which can be derived
from the 13- atom icosahedron, the polyicosahedral 19-,
23-, and 26-atom clusters and 55-atom icosahedron, by
adding or removing atoms. However, exceptions to the
icosahedral growth is found around n ∼ 40. A local geo-
metrical transition is found for n = 40 − 44- atom clus-

9

ters. This is in agreement with the prediction of the two
experimental studies by Katakuse et al.[10] and Winter
et al.[50], where they predicted that a local geometrical
transition may occur at n = 42, though their results are
not decisive about the nature of this geometrical change.
Present results show that around n ∼ 40 structures
are changing from icosahedral to decahedral structure,
where the structural sequence is decahedron-icosahedron-
cuboctahedron in the decreasing order of stability. Re-
turn to the icosahedral growth is found at n = 45, with
the sequence icosahedron-decahedron-cuboctahedron in
the decreasing order of stability.

As we have ﬁtted the parameters of the present TBMD
scheme from LDA based ab inito calculations [22], calcu-
lated binding energies are in good agreement with the
LDA based ab initio calculations but overestimates the
same calculated from the TCID experiment [18]. In the
present scheme, the “magic nimbers” (n = 2, 8, 18, 20,
34 and 40) due to electronic shell and subshell closing
are correctly reproduced in the studied regime. Second
diﬀerence of binding energy, HOMO-LUMO gap energy
and ionization potential show even-odd oscillatory be-
haviour because of electron pairing in HOMOs in agree-
ment with experiment. However, a sudden loss in even-
odd alternation is found around n ∼ 40 in the variation of
second diﬀerence in binding energy, HOMO-LUMO gap
energy and ionization potential with cluster size. This is
in agreement with the experimental studies [10, 50]. We
conclude this is due to the geometrical change (icosahe-
dron → decahedron) around there. Present results show
that electronic structure can coexist with a ﬁxed atomic
packing.

Due to lower computational expense this TBMD
scheme, with parameters ﬁtted to ﬁrst-principle calcu-
lation for the smaller clusters and with an environment
correction, is a very eﬃcient technique to study larger
clusters, particularly with n ≥ 10.

parameter q) in the Gupta potential can lead to changes
in the global minima. see- K. Michaelian, N. Rendon and
I. L. Garz´on, Phys. Rev. B 60, 2000 (1999).

[56] The set of SK-TB parameters in this scheme implies that
within the Koopmans’ theorem, ionization potentials are
approximately equal to the on-site energy Es = Ed,
which is usually much higher than highest occupied s-
orbital energy of the free atom. A constant shift is made
in plotting of the Fig.5. See Ref.[31].

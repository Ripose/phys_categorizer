Fission of metastable charged univalent metal clusters has been studied on example of N a2+
10
and N a2+
18 clusters by means of density functional theory methods. Energetics of the process, i.e.
dissociation energies and ﬁssion barriers, as well as its dynamics, i.e. ﬁssion pathways, have been
analyzed. The dissociation energies and ﬁssion barriers have been calculated for the full range of
ﬁssion channels for the N a2+
10 cluster. Our data conﬁrms the viewpoint that there is some correlation
between these two quantities, which can often be explained by electronic shell eﬀects. However, there
is no quantitative correspondence between the dissociation energies and heights of ﬁssion barriers
and the former can not serve as a quick estimate for the latter. The impact of cluster structure
on the ﬁssion process has been elucidated. The calculations show that the geometry of the smaller
fragment and geometry of its immediate neighborhood in the larger fragment play a leading role in
deﬁning the ﬁssion barrier height: energy barriers for removing diﬀerent combinations of atoms from
the same parent cluster can vary greatly, while energy barriers for removing similar groups of atoms
from similar places in diﬀerent isomers of the parent cluster are usually similar. The present study
demonstrates importance of rearrangement of the cluster structure during ﬁssion. The rearrangment
can lower the ﬁssion barriers signiﬁcantly. It may include forming a neck between the two fragments
or ﬁssioning via another isomer state of the parent cluster; examples of such processes are given. For
several low-lying isomers of N a2+
10 cluster the potential barriers for transitions between these isomer
states are calculated and compared with the corresponding ﬁssion barriers. These data suggest that
there is a competition between “direct” ﬁssion and ﬁssion going via intermediate isomer states of
the parent cluster. An impact of the cluster geometry on the change of the system’s entropy due to
ﬁssion is also discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Studying properties of charged clusters is of great interest both from theoretical and experimental viewpoints.1 In
experiments, widely used clusters detection techniques proceed via ionization and subsequent mass spectrometry of
clusters (see Refs. 2,3 for a review and references). On the other hand, charged clusters behaviour presents one of the
instances of a long standing fundamental theoretical problem of stability of complex systems since charged clusters
can be found in stable, metastable or unstable states, depending on cluster size and excessive charge. Metal clusters
are especially attractive subject of study because ﬁssion of charged metal clusters provides close analogies to the
corresponding processes in nuclear systems.

For semi-quantitative classiﬁcation of stability of charged metal clusters it is convenient to use a ﬁssility parameter
introduced by Lord Rayleigh more than a century ago,4 while he was investigating stability of small charged liquid
droplets. The ﬁssility parameter is deﬁned as ratio of the Coulomb to surface energies of the drop, X = ECoul/2ESurf.
For spherical sodium clusters5 X ≈ 2.5 Q2/N (Q and N are the cluster charge and size, respectively). For X ≪ 1
clusters are stable, for X ≫ 1 clusters are unstable and fragment by the Coulomb explosion. For X ∼ 1 clusters
are found in metastable states and must overcome a potential barrier in order to ﬁssion. As in many other recent
studies,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 of both experimental and theoretical character, we focus on the latter situation and present results
of our all-electrons density functional calculations which help to achieve better understanding of various aspects of
ﬁssion of metastable charged metal clusters. We use sodium clusters, well studied experimentally, as a sample revealing
general properties of univalent metal clusters.

Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we employ density functional theory methods for calculating the
electronic structure for every given conﬁguration of the nuclei. Our approach diﬀers from the standard technique
of molecular dynamics simulations. In our calculations we explore the multi-dimensional potential energy surface of
a cluster system in order to ﬁnd the local minima on this surface, corresponding to diﬀerent cluster isomers. The
potential energy surface also allows to determine the optimal ﬁssion pathways which minimize the ﬁssion barriers.

We begin with calculating the energetics of the ﬁssion process. We present the dissociation energies and ﬁssion
10 cluster for which the excessive charge is distributed between the

The dissociation energies is an important characteristic of the ﬁssion process, useful in assessing stability/instability
of a particular cluster. Comparison of the dissociation energies and ﬁssion barriers shows that there is some correlation
between the two quantities. This correlation can often be explained by electronic shell eﬀects which favour forming
fragments with ﬁlled and half-ﬁlled shells. However, as one may expect, the correlation is only qualitative, and
therefore dissociation energies can not serve as an easy-to-calculate, convenient tool for making reliable predictions
concerning the ﬁssion process (e.g. predictions of the preferred ﬁssion channel or branching ratios between diﬀerent
channels) and one needs to ﬁnd ﬁssion barrier heights.

10 → 2N a+

On the other hand, even knowledge of the ﬁssion barrier heights is sometimes not suﬃcient for predicting the
preferred ﬁssion channel. This is the case for the dominant asymmetric, N a2+
3 , and symmetric,
N a2+
10 cluster. Considerations based on electronic shell eﬀects suggest that
these two channels ought to be the favoured ones. The accurate ab initio calculations conﬁrm this conclusion, but it
turns out that the barrier heights for these channels are so close that one needs to take into account geometrical and
statistical factors, as discussed below (section III B).

Our approach permits also studying the dynamics of the ﬁssion process. Having calculated the multi-dimensional
energy surface we were able to determine the optimal dynamic pathways of the ﬁssion for all the channels considered.
Analysis of the data suggests that signiﬁcant rearangement of the cluster structure often accompanies ﬁssion.

One can distinguish between two main types of such rearrangement.12 The ﬁrst one is a rearrangement of the cluster
structure without signiﬁcant change in distance between the centers of mass of the prospective fragments. This type
of rearrangement takes place before the actual separation of the fragments begins and it is, in fact, a transition to
another isomer state of the parent cluster.12 The second type of rearrangement is characterized by existence of a super-
molecule-like intermediate state in which the fragments are suﬃciently separated from each other, but connected by
a ”neck”.12,13,14,15 A similar necking phenomenon is known for nuclear ﬁssion.16 Necking allows for great reduction
in the overall height of the ﬁssion barrier and is responsible for a double humped form of the barrier. In dynamical
simulations necking can be observed as an elongation of the cluster shape during ﬁssion.5,9

The ﬁrst type of rearrangement implies that there is a competition between one-step (“direct” ﬁssion) and two-step
(ﬁssion via an intermediate isomer state) processes. Therefore, in order to make predictions concerning the ﬁssion
activation energy and ﬁssion pathway for a given cluster isomer one has ﬁrst to ﬁnd the energy barrier for the direct
ﬁssion of the given isomer and then to compare the height of this barrier with the heights of the ﬁssion barriers for
other low lying isomers. The diﬀerences in the isomer energies and potential barriers between the isomers have also
to be taken into account. We present such analysis for the N a2+

Accounting for geometry of a ﬁssioning cluster1 necessitates an extra care in calculating the ﬁssion barriers, since
removing diﬀerent combinations of atoms requires overcoming diﬀerent barriers. In other words, diﬀerent combinations
of atoms are not necessarily equivalent in respect to ﬁssion. Depending on the symmetry group of a cluster there may
exist the groups of atoms with the same potential energy barriers. When searching for the ﬁssion barrier of a cluster
one needs to identify all such groups of atoms and choose the group with the lowest barrier.

10 cluster.

It is sometimes also possible to identify geometrically similar groups of atoms, belonging to diﬀerent isomers, for
which the energy barriers are very close, even though the overall geometries of the isomers can be quite unalike. This
suggests that the geometry of the smaller fragment and geometry of its immediate neighborhood in the parent cluster
play a leading role in deﬁning the energy barrier height.

Accounting for cluster geometry, which leads to non-equivalence of diﬀerent combinations of atoms may have a
further important impact on the way how the change of the system entropy due to ﬁssion should be calculated. It has
been argued17,18 that accounting for an entropy change contribution to the free energy of the system is necessary for
correct description of the temperature and size dependences of the branching ratios between diﬀerent ﬁssion channels,
while purely energetic considerations based on ﬁssion barrier heights fail. The entropy change is, in fact, a change in
the statistical weight of the initial and ﬁnal states of the system. In order to calculate the change in the statistical
weight one has to count the change in number of combinations out of which the initial and ﬁnal states of the system
are composed. The non-equivalence of diﬀerent combinations of atoms leads to replacement of the binominal law,
used when all the atoms in a cluster are equivalent,18 by a more accurate treatment, which has to take into account
particular geometry of a given isomer. We base such a treatment on counting the number of equivalent combinations
of atoms with the minimum potential energy barrier. The type of statistics to be used when calculating the change of
the system’s entropy is determined by the cluster temperature. At high temperatures the cluster is melted and does

1 This is, of course, sensible for cluster temperatures below the melting point only. For temperatures above the melting point the atoms

in clusters do not have stationary positions and one can not speak of a certain geometry of a cluster.

not posess a certain structure. In this situation the purely combinatorial approach is fully justiﬁed. Conversely, at
low temperatures a more detailed account of the cluster structure is needed.

We note, that the kinds of studies mentioned above are beyond the scope of simpler approaches which do not take
into account ionic structure of clusters. In such approaches, e.g. in the jellium model, one may speak of, say, prolate
and oblate jellium shapes as of diﬀerent isomers, but this does not reﬂect all the variety of energies and geometries of
stable cluster isomers.

We utilize the methods of density functional theory (DFT) within the Born-Oppenheimer scheme. In accord with

the DFT prescriptions we iteratively solve the Kohn-Sham equations19

Refs. 23,24.

B. Simulation procedure

We employ a procedure somewhat diﬀerent from the usual molecular dynamics simulations techniques.

In our
calculation we explore the multi-dimensional potential energy surface of the cluster. For each point on this surface
we solve Eq. 1 for the corresponding geometry of the atomic nuclei by expanding the cluster orbitals into the basis
sets of primitive Gaussian functions25 with the use of the GAUSSIAN 03 software package.26

The 6-31G(d) and LANL2DZ basis sets of the Gaussian functions have been used. The 6-31G(d) basis set has been
used for simulations involving the N a2+
10 cluster. This basis set expands all the atomic orbitals, so that the dynamics
of all particles in the system is accounted for. For the N a2+
18 cluster we have used the more numerically eﬃcient
LANL2DZ basis, for which valent atomic electrons move in an eﬀective core potential (see details in Ref. 25). The
accuracy and consistency of the calculations is proved by the correct asymptotics of the total energy of the system at
large separation distances, i.e. the total energy of the system at large separation distances equals to the sum of the
total energies of the charged isolated fragments (calculated separately) and the Coulomb repulsion energy. For certain
ﬁssion channels we have also compared the ﬁssion barriers obtained with the use of diﬀerent basis sets (6-311G(d),
6-31G(d), LANL2DZ) and conﬁrmed that our results do not depend on the choice of the basis set.

The global minimum on thus found multi-dimensional potential energy surface corresponds to the energetically
preferred state of the system. In the case of metastable doubly charged clusters the global minimum corresponds

4

to the system, fragmented into two charged parts. The ﬁssion channel corresponding to the global minimum can be
determined from the dissociation energies which can be generally deﬁned as

N −P − EQ
N ,

DQ,Q′
N,P = EQ′

P + EQ−Q′
where N and Q are the size and the charge of the parent cluster, P and Q′ are the size and the charge of one of the
daughter fragments, EW
M is the total energy of a cluster of size M and charge W . The global minimum is located in
the domain of the potential energy surface where the distance between the two fragments is inﬁnitely large. There are
other local minima at inﬁnitely large distances between the fragments (at the ”edges” of the potential energy surface)
corresponding to other possible ﬁssion channels. The deepest local minimum on the potential energy surface which
is located in the ”center” part of the surface, where the two parts of the system are close, corresponds to the ground
state of the cluster, while other local minima in the center part of the surface represent other (meta)stable isomer
states.

(5)

In this potential energy surface approach the simulation of the ﬁssion process comes to ﬁnding a pathway on the
system’s multi-dimensional potential energy surface from a minimum in the center part of the surface to a minimum
at its edge. The found pathway must minimize the energy barrier for the transition.

In simulation of the ﬁssion process we start from the optimized geometry of a cluster (for details of the geometry
optimization procedure see Ref. 23) and choose the atoms the resulting fragments would consist of. The atoms chosen
for a smaller fragment are shifted from their optimized locations in the parent cluster to a certain distance. Then,
the multi-dimensional potential energy surface, its gradient and forces with respect to the molecular coordinates are
calculated. These quantities specify the direction along the surface in which the energy decreases most rapidly and
provide information for the determination of the next place for placing the atoms. If the fragments are removed not
far enough from each other then the cohesive forces prevail over the repulsive ones and the fragments stick together
forming the uniﬁed cluster again. Forming the uniﬁed cluster does not necessarily mean returning to the same point on
the potential energy surface; it may happen that the system gets into another local minimum. This would correspond
to changing the isomer state of the cluster. Correspondingly, one can ﬁnd a potential barrier for such transition. If
the fragments are far enough from each other, the repulsive forces dominate and the fragments drift away from each
other. The dependence of the total energy of the system on the fragments separation distance forms the potential
energy barrier for a given pathway. Hence, ﬁnding the ﬁssion barrier is equivalent to ﬁnding the pathway with the
lowest potential energy barrier.

Determining ﬁssion barriers is a computationally demanding task which requires a lot of computer resources.
Currently, it is not feasible to study the multi-dimensional potential energy surface in ﬁne details even for relatively
small clusters.2 Therefore, there is no guarantee that the found ﬁssion pathways provide the lowest ﬁssion barriers.
Even small deviation from the found pathway may result in a slight decrease in the ﬁssion barrier height. We estimate
accuracy of the ﬁssion barrier heights presented in this paper to be 0.02-0.04 eV. Further calculations could allow to
obtain a more accurate proﬁle of the ﬁssion barrier and to determine the ﬁssion barrier height more precisely. However,
the accuracy of theoretical models used nowadays to describe the experimental results, as well as the accuracy of the
experimental data itself, make such reﬁnements unneeded.

10 cluster, N a2+

There is also a possibility that we have overlooked a completely diﬀerent ﬁssion pathway which would make the
ﬁssion barrier even lower. In fact, this was the case with the ﬁssion barrier for the dominant asymmetric ﬁssion channel
for the N a2+
7 . Our previous calculations12 had resulted in the ﬁssion barrier of about
0.5 eV for this channel. This was in a good agreement with the results of other molecular dynamics simulations.5,15
However, a more detailed study of the multi-dimensional potential energy surface performed in this work which
included a more complete analysis of various possible rearrangements of the cluster structure in the course of ﬁssion
allowed us to ﬁnd a lower ﬁssion barrier for this channel, equal to 0.34 eV.

process, while dissociation energy plays a smaller role. The parameters of the ﬁssion barriers largely deﬁne many
experimentally observable characteristics of the process, including branching ratios between diﬀerent ﬁssion channels,
ﬁssion time, etc. The dissociation energies are of limited use for metastable clusters. Their negative signs show that
the clusters are unstable in respect to the corresponding ﬁssion channels. One could hope that easy-to-calculate
dissociation energies could serve as quick qualitative estimates of ﬁssion barriers, since calculations of ﬁssion barriers
are much more laborious and require more computer resources.

one needs to carry out the full calculation in order to ﬁnd the ﬁssion barrier. Only after that one can make reliable
predictions concerning the ﬁssion process.

The correlation in dependence of the dissociation energy and ﬁssion barrier height on the size of the daughter
fragment can be explained by electronic shell eﬀects which favour forming fragments with ﬁlled and half-ﬁlled shells.
Indeed, the barrier maxima are located at distances comparable to or exceeding the sum of the resulting fragments
radii, that is not far from the scission point. At such distances the interaction between the fragments, apart from
Coulombic repulsion, is mainly determined by the electronic properties of the system (and also by the cluster geometry
in the immediate vicinity of the scission point), rather than by the details of the ionic structure of the bulk of the
fragments.

Indeed, the a priori electronic shell considerations suggest that, for example, for the N a2+

10 cluster two ﬁssion
channels, namely, N a2+
5 , dominate. Our calculations conﬁrm this conclusion, but
it turns out that the barrier heights for these channels are so close that the geometrical and statistical factors become
of primary importance. We discuss the impact of geometry of the cluster on the ﬁssion process in the next subsection.

Impact of the cluster geometry on ﬁssion process

Detailed analysis of cluster geometry in the course of ﬁssion allows for deeper understanding of the process. It,
however, brings in two issues which must be properly accounted for. The ﬁrst one is the fact that the diﬀerent
combinations of equal number of atoms are not necessarily equivalent for a given cluster geometry, and the potential
barriers to be overcome in order to remove these combinations of atoms from the parent cluster are quite likely to
diﬀer. The second issue is that not always “direct” ﬁssion (i.e. straightforward removing some combination of atoms
from the parent cluster) has lower potential barrier than ﬁssion going via an intermediate isomer state of the parent
cluster or via formation of a super-molecule-like necked structure. This latter issue will be discussed in detail in the
next subsection.

The problem of ﬁnding the lowest ﬁssion barrier is simpliﬁed in many cases by the presence of a symmetry in
a cluster geometry which reduces the number of non-equivalent combinations of atoms participating in the ﬁssion
process.

Let us consider ﬁssion of the N a2+

10 cluster. Its ground state isomer has a slightly distorted symmetry of the Td point
symmetry group23 and can be described as a pyramid, see Figure 3. We will denote this isomer as T (1)
d . Four atoms
in the isomer are located in the vertices of the pyramid and six are in the centers of the edges. All the edge and all the
vertex atoms can be considered equivalent. Therefore, when considering the ﬁssion channel N a2+

suﬃces to ﬁnd two energy barriers only rather than calculating a barrier for each atom. The potential energy barrier
height for removing an atom from an edge of the cluster is 0.85 eV, while it is 0.71 eV for removing an atom from a
vertex. Hence, the ﬁssion barrier height for the ﬁssion channel is 0.71 eV.

There are more energy barriers which need to be calculated for the N a2+

2 channel. Totally, there are
45 combinations of two atoms out of ten. Fortunately, there are only ﬁve energy barriers which are to be calculated.
Indeed, two atoms which are to be removed from the parent cluster can be taken either both from the vertices, or
both from the edges, or one atom from a vertex and one from an edge. All combinations of two atoms taken from
the vertices are equivalent. There are six such combinations which we will denote as VV. Twenty four combinations
of two atoms in which one atom comes from a vertex and one from an edge can be further divided into two equal
subgroups. In the ﬁrst subgroup (VE1) atoms belong to the same edge while in the second subgroup (VE2) they
do not. Fifteen combinations of atoms from the edges are also divided into two subgroups. The ﬁrst one contains
atoms belonging to the same face of the pyramid (twelve combinations, EE1) and the second group (EE2) contains
the combinations of atoms from the diﬀerent pyramid faces. The heights of the energy barriers for these ﬁve groups
are summarized in Table II.

8 + N a+

One can see from Table II that in the case of the N a2+

2 channel, the two atoms which are to
be removed from the parent cluster in the ﬁssion process must be taken either from a vertex and the middle of an
edge originating from this vertex or from the middles of two edges belonging to the the face of the pyramid. Other
combinations of atoms have higher potential barriers and do not participate, as a good approximation, in the process.
In other words, the daughter fragment should contain certain classes of combinations of atoms only, in order to obtain
a lower potential energy barrier. Our analysis shows that this conclusion is also valid for other ﬁssion channels and
parent cluster isomers. Typically, the combinations which provide the minimum energy barrier include neighbouring
atoms located in a part of the parent cluster which can be the most easily removed.

10 → N a+

8 + N a+

On the other hand, it is sometimes possible to identify geometrically similar groups of atoms belonging to diﬀerent
isomers for which the energy barriers are very close, even though the overall geometries of the isomers are not similar
and can even be quite unalike. This fact taken in conjunction with the non-equivalence of diﬀerent combinations of
atoms wihin one isomer state, suggests that the geometry of the smaller fragment and geometry of its immediate
neighborhood in the larger fragment play a leading role in deﬁning the energy barrier height. We can demonstrate
this by comparing energy barriers for removing similar groups of atoms from similar places in the parent cluster for
two diﬀerent isomer states of the N a2+
10 cluster. One of these isomers possesses the symmetry of C4v point symmetry
group and another one is of D4d symmetry. The isomers geometries are depicted in Figure 4, the groups of atoms to
be removed are shown in black color. The resulting barriers are presented in Figure 5. It is seen from the ﬁgure that
the barriers are similar not only in height but also in shape. This can be explained by similarities of the geometries

of the prospective smaller fragments, similarities in the immediate neighbourhoods of the smaller fragments, and also
by similarities in the charge distribution in the isomers, and by absence of additional structure rearrangements in the
course of ﬁssion.

Fragment separation (a.u.)

FIG. 5: (Color online) Energy barriers for removing similar combinations of three atoms (marked by black color in Figure 4)
from the two diﬀerent isomers of the N a2+
10 cluster. The barriers plotted versus distance between the centers of mass of the
fragments. The curve with the stars corresponds to the isomer with the symmetry of C4v point group (iso1414); the curve
with the diamonds corresponds to the isomer posessing the symmetry of D4d point group (iso1441). Note, that energies are
measured from the energy of the initial state of the corresponding isomer, i.e. we plot E − EC4v (D4d), where E is the total
energy of the system and EC4v (D4d) are the energies of the iso1414 and iso1441 isomers, respectively.

The fact of inequivalence of diﬀerent combinations of atoms in a cluster isomer may have an important impact
on various characteristics of the ﬁssion process such as branching ratios between diﬀerent ﬁssion channels and their
temperature dependence.

It has been argued theoretically and shown experimentally that dominant ﬁssion channels and the branching ratios
between diﬀerent channels are not governed by purely energetic considerations but also by the free energy change
which takes into account the diﬀerent combinations of atoms which constitute the fragments.17,18 Accounting for an
entropy change contribution to the free energy of the system was necessary for correct description of the experimental
results. The branching ratio I2/I1 between two channels is then deﬁned by the diﬀerence in the ﬁssion barrier heights
∆B ≡ BQ,Q′

N,P1 and by the entropy change ∆S of the system:

N,P2 − BQ,Q′

I2
I1

= f exp(

∆S
k

−

∆B
kT

).

Here k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the cluster temperature, f is a frequency factor. This factor arises due to
diﬀerent frequencies ω of oscillations in the modes leading to fragmentation of the cluster in diﬀerent ﬁssion channels.
Roughly speaking, the fragmentation occurs when due to a ﬂuctuation energy concentrates in a single oscillation
mode in the amount suﬃcient for overcoming the ﬁssion barrier. Fission would be more probable if the frequency of
oscillations in this mode is higher, since then the system would ”attempt to fragment” more frequently. Hence, in
a crude approximation f ∼ ω2/ω1. If one assumes that the potential surfaces for both modes can be approximated
by parabolas with same curvatures, then the ratio of the frequencies of oscillations will depend only on the reduced
masses µ of the pairs of the prospective fragments, f ∼
µ1/µ2. For the dominant asymmetric and symmetric ﬁssion
channels for the N a2+
10 cluster the frequency factor f is about 1.1, so we will neglect its inﬂuence and put f = 1. Of
course, this factor can be estimated more accurately. In order to do that one has to determine all the normal modes of
oscillations of the parent cluster, to represent the oscillations leading to the given ﬁssion channel via a combination of
normal mode oscillations and calculate the probability that enough energy would ﬂuctuate into these normal modes.
Such an analysis would go beyond the aims of the current work and can be a subject of a separate study. We now
focus on the inﬂuence of the cluster structure on the way how the system’s entropy should be calculated.

p

The entropy change entering the equation (7) is, in fact, a change in the statistical weight of the initial and ﬁnal
states of the system. In order to calculate the change in the statistical weight Γ one has to count the change in number
of combinations out of which the initial and ﬁnal states of the system are composed,

∆S = k ln Γ2 − k ln Γ1 = k ln

Γ2
Γ1

.

For high temperatures all atoms can be considered equivalent and the number of combinations of P atoms out of N
is given by the binominal coeﬃcient, Γ = CP

N , so that

∆S = k ln

N !
(N − P2)!P2!

− k ln

(N − P1)!P1!

= k ln

(N − P1)!P1!
(N − P2)!P2!

The non-equivalence of diﬀerent combinations of atoms requires replacement of the binominal law, used in Ref. 18
for high temperature regime when all the atoms in cluster are equivalent, by a more detailed treatment, which has to
take into account particular geometry of a given isomer. Such a treatment should be based on counting the number
of equivalent combinations of atoms which provide the minimum potential energy barrier (for low temperatures it is
justiﬁed to assume that ﬁssion proceeds only through the pathway with the minimum energy barrier). This change
in the statistics may lead to signiﬁcant change in the branching ratios between ﬁssion channels and to the alteration
of the predominant channel.

10 → 2N a+

5 and asymmetric N a2+

For example, symmetric N a2+

3 channels have very similar ﬁssion
barriers, and one would expect that these two processes would occur with similar probabilities. The diﬀerence in the
barriers heights of 0.01 eV (see Table I) would lead to the branching ratio between the symmetric and asymmetric
channels approximately equal to 2:3 at room temperature and 1:1 at higher temperatures. If one adopts the statistics
based on the binominal law, the symmetric channel becomes the preferred ﬁssion channel, since there are 252 combi-
nations of ﬁve atoms out of ten and only 120 combinations of three atoms out of ten. Therefore, using the binominal
statistics leads one to conclude that the symmetric channel should prevail in experimental mass spectra.

10 → N a+

7 + N a+

If, however, diﬀerent combinations of atoms in the parent cluster are considered non-equivalent, then one needs to
identify carefully the combinations of atoms which provide the lowest separation barrier and to count the numbers of
such combinations. In the asymmetric channel the lowest barrier is obtained when an atom from a vertex and two
neighbouring atoms from the middles of the edges which cross at the vertex are removed. There are totally 12 such
combinations of atoms. In the symmetric channel four atoms are removed from the top of the pyramid and one from
the middle of the edge in the base of the pyramid. There are 12 such combinations, too. Hence, the statistics which
accounts for the cluster geometry leads one to conclude that both channels statistically are equally probable, so the
branching ratio is governed by the heights of the barriers only, i.e. the asymmetric channel prevails.

10

The statistics based on the binominal law is more adequate for high temperatures when a cluster is melted and
does not possess a certain structure3. To the contrary, at low temperatures, when the cluster structure is important,
the alternative statistics is more appropriate.

One can make an important conclusion based on these considerations regarding the particular case of ﬁssion of
10 cluster. Namely, at high temperatures the symmetric channel is the preferred ﬁssion channel, while at low

the N a2+
temperatures when the cluster structure comes into play the asymmetric channel slightly dominates.

C. Fission dynamics: ﬁssion pathways and rearrangement during ﬁssion

The potential energy surface approach allows one to study the dynamics of the ﬁssion process. Having calculated
the multi-dimensional potential energy surface for N a2+
18 clusters we were able to determine the optimal
pathways for all the considered ﬁssion channels, i.e. we have determined the coordinates of all atoms which minimize
the total cluster energy on each step of the simulation for each ﬁssion channel.

10 and N a2+

We have observed that often ﬁssion barrier can be greatly lowered by drawing the ﬁssion pathway via a local
minimum on the potential energy surface. In other words, ﬁssion can proceed via formation of intermediate isomers.
This requires extra rearrangement of the cluster structure as compared to a more straightforward ﬁssion pathway.

One can distinguish between two main kinds of such rearrangement.12 The ﬁrst one is rearrangement of the cluster
structure without signiﬁcant change in distance between the centers of mass of the prospective fragments. This
type of rearrangement takes place before actual separation of the fragments begins and it is, in fact, a transition to
another isomer state of the parent cluster. The second type of rearrangement is characterized by existence of a super-
molecule-like intermediate state in which the fragments are suﬃciently separated from each other, but connected by
a ”neck”.12,13,14,15 A similar necking phenomenon is known for nuclear ﬁssion16. Necking is responsible for a double
humped form of the ﬁssion barrier. In dynamical simulations necking can be observed as an elongation of the cluster
shape during ﬁssion.5,9

For the N a2+

10 cluster, the rearrangement of the second type takes place in the three out of ﬁve ﬁssion channels
which can be easily recognized by the double humped form of the corresponding ﬁssion barriers in Figure 1. A typical
example of such rearrangement is presented in Figure 6. The key point in this process is the transition from the
ﬁrst transitional state (the most right geometry in the ﬁrst row) to the intermediate state (the most left ﬁgure in
the second row). Exactly this transition results in signiﬁcant lowering of the ﬁssion barrier, down to 0.34 eV from
0.48 eV in the situation when the atoms are continued to be pulled out from the cluster and the intermediate state is
not allowed to form. The intermediate state is a super-molecule-like extended structure with a neck-like connection
between its parts. The further ﬁssioning of this intermediate structure is a simple stretching the neck and eventual
complete separation of the fragments.

3 Melting temperature of bulk sodium is 371 K, while for clusters it was estimated to be about 300-400 K28,29

Let us now return to the ﬁrst type of rearrangement. This type of rearrangement implies that there is a competition
between one-step (“direct” ﬁssion) and two-step (ﬁssion via an intermediate isomer state) processes. Therefore, in
order to make predictions concerning the ﬁssion activation energy and ﬁssion pathway for a given cluster isomer one
has ﬁrst to ﬁnd energy barrier for the direct ﬁssion of the given isomer and then compare the height of this barrier
with the heights of the barriers for transitions between given and several other low lying isomers, and also with the
heights of the ﬁssion barriers of those isomers.
We present such analysis for the N a2+

10 cluster. The energies of the several energetically favourable isomers are
summarized in Table III, their geometries are shown in Figure 7. 4 The energy barrier heights for transitions between
these isomers are presented in Table IV.

The analysis of the potential energy barriers for transitions between diﬀerent isomer states of the N a2+

10 cluster and
of the potential energy barriers of fragmentation of the cluster leads to an interesting fact. It turns out that there are
two ﬁssion pathways energetically equally probable in the symmetric ﬁssion of the N a2+
5 . Both
of the pathways provide the minimum energy barrier (0.32 eV) for the symmetric fragmentation of the parent cluster.
Both of the pathways involve rearrangement of the cluster’s structure. The energy barrier for the ﬁrst pathway is
shown in Figure 1. According to the ﬁrst pathway, the ﬁssion starts from separating the two prospective fragments
which later form a metastable super-molecule-like structure which leads to a well in the middle of the ﬁssion barrier.

The second ﬁssion pathway constitutes an even more complicated, two-stage process. On the ﬁrst stage the base of
the pyramid in the parent cluster T (1)
reshapes from the triangle into a non-planar pentagon with an atom in its
center forming a new isomer denoted T (2)
d , Figure 7. After that the top four atoms in the pyramid and the atom
from the center of the pentagon can be removed from the rest of the cluster. Again, this process proceeds via forming
a necked-shaped super-molecule-like structure. For comparison, when the rearrangements are not allowed and the
chosen group of atoms is simply pulled out of the parent cluster the lowest possible energy barrier (for removal the
top four atoms and an atom from a vertex of the base triangle) equals to 0.63 eV.

The rearrangements of the cluster structure of the both types is a general feature of the metal cluster ﬁssion process.
They occur for other clusters and ﬁssion channels too. As an illustration we plot in Figure 8 the ﬁssion barriers for
ﬁssion of N a2+
18 cluster in symmetric and dominant asymmetric channels. The geometries corresponding to diﬀerent
stages of the ﬁssion process in each channel are presented in Figure 9.

To conclude, we have examined in detail ﬁssion of doubly charged sodium clusters N a2+

10 . Many new reference data
are presented. Three main conclusions can be drawn from our studies. Firstly, geometry of the smaller fragment
and geometry of its immediate neighborhood in the parent cluster (together with the electronic shell eﬀects) play a
leading role in deﬁning the ﬁssion barrier height. Secondly, rearrangement of the cluster structure in the course of
ﬁssion can lower the ﬁssion barriers signiﬁcantly. We distinguish two general types of rearrangement: ”necking” and
ﬁssioning via another low-lying isomer state of the parent cluster. And ﬁnally, accounting for geometrical structure of

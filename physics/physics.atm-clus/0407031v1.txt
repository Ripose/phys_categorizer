Abstract

We examine the vibrational stability of three candidate structures for the B24N24
cage and report their infra-red (IR) and Raman spectra. The candidate structures
considered are a round cage with octahedral Øsymmetry, a cage with S4 symmetry
that satisﬁes the isolated square rule, and a cage of S8 symmetry, which combines
the caps of the (4,4) nanotube, and contains two extra squares and octagons. The
calculations are performed within density functional theory, at the all electron level,
with large basis sets, and within the generalized gradient approximation. The verti-
cal ionization potential (VIP) and static dipole polarizability are also reported. The
S4 and S8 cages are energetically nearly degenerate and are favored over the Øcage
which has six extra octagons and squares. The IR and Raman spectra of the three
clusters show notable diﬀerences providing thereby a way to identify and possibly
synthesize the cages.

Recently, boron nitride (BN) cages were synthesized and detected by laser des-
orption time of ﬂight mass spectroscopy [1]. The B24N24 cluster was observed
in abundance and its structure was proposed to be a round cage structure with
octahedral (Ø) symmetry (Cf. Fig. 1), in an analogy to the icosahedral C60
cluster. It consists of alternate BN atoms and is made round by introducing
eighteen defects: six octagons and twelve squares, in the hexagonal network
of a single BN sheet. In the icosahedral C60 fullerene every carbon atom is
equivalent by symmetry. Similarly every boron or nitrogen atom in this octa-
hedral structure is equivalent by symmetry. Taking a cue from the similarity
of C60 fullerene and the O B24N24 cage it was suggested that the two halves of
the round octahedral cage can form hemispherical caps for the (4,4) BN nan-
otubes [2] analogous to C60 hemispheres capping the (5,5) carbon nanotube
[3]. Further by Euler theorem, in analogy to the twelve isolated pentagons of
C60, six isolates squares close the alternate BN fullerenes [4,5]. For the B24N24,
the resultant cage (Cf. Fig. 1) has S4 symmetry [5]. In a recent study [6] that
examined seven candidate structures for the B24N24 geometry, the S4 cage
was found to be energetically favorable over the Øcage in agreement with our
work. A new, most stable cage structure was found that has S8 symmetry and
contains eight squares and two octagons in the hexagonal network [6]. The S8
cage is related to the B28N28 or B32N32 (4,4) closed nanotubes in Ref. [2] and
can be derived from B28N28 by eliminating a middle ring of alternating BN
atoms followed by rotation by 45o. The energy diﬀerences between these iso-
mers, particularly between the S8 and S4 cages are quite small (0.1eV or less)
and thus based on energetics it is not apparent which isomer is most likely to
be observed in the experiment. Clearly more theoretical calculations or further
experimental characterization is necessary. For this purpose we have carried
out density functional [8] calculations on the three candidate structures of
the B24N24 clusters. We predict the infra-red (IR) and Raman spectra for the
three isomers which may aid the experimentalists in identifying the structure
of B24N24 . Along with these spectra we also report the ionization potential,
and the static dipole polarizability of the three cages. Our calculations are
carried out at the all electron level by the NRLMOL code [9,10,11], using
large polarized Gaussian basis sets [12] optimized for these density functional
calculations, and using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient ap-
proximation (PBE-GGA) [13].

The energetics and the electronic properties of optimized structures are sum-
marized in Table 1. The calculations predict the S8 cage as the lowest en-
ergy structure. The S4 isomer is within 0.03 eV while the Øcage is 2.6 eV
higher. This energy ordering is in accord with earlier hybrid density functional
(B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations [6]. These energy diﬀerences are of same magni-
tude even with addition of the zero-point energy. The vibrational frequencies
determined within the harmonic approximation indicate all structures to be
local minima on the potential energy surface. Further, consistent with earlier
prediction on the BN cages and nanotubes [14], these cages are characterized

We note that the HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained within the present PBE-GGA
generally underestimate the sum of ionization potential and electron aﬃnity.

The vertical ionization potential (VIP) is calculated from the the diﬀerences in
total energy of the self-consistent solution of the cluster and its singly charged
positive ion, at the optimal ionic conﬁguration of the neutral cluster. The
calculated VIP are also given in Table 1. We note that the VIP reported for
the ØB24N24 cage in Ref. [2] should be 8.64 eV instead of incorrectly reported
value of 6.66 eV. The vertical electron aﬃnity calculations can be performed in
similar fashion. We ﬁnd that the additional electron is weakly bound (despite
relatively large basis set used in the calculation its eigenvalue turns out to be
positive although the total energy is lowered with respect to neutral cluster).

The static dipole polarizability is an important physical quantity that charac-
terizes the electric response of the clusters to applied uniform electric ﬁeld. It
is calculated from the so called ﬁnite ﬁeld method in which the self-consistent
problem is solved for the usual Hamiltonian augmented with the ﬁeld term
~E · ~r. The polarizability tensor is built from the self-consistent solutions per-
formed for various values of electric ﬁeld E along diﬀerent directions. The
nuclei are assumed to be frozen. The calculated values are shown in Table 2.
The mean polarizability of the three isomers is of similar magnitude with the
Øcage being slightly more polarizable. The structural diﬀerences of the iso-
mers are reﬂected in the anisotropy of the polarizability. Unlike the perfectly
round Øcage, the isomers S8 and S4 have nonzero anisotropy.

The calculated IR spectra are presented in Fig. 2. The frequencies and their
symmetries of IR active modes are listed in Table 3. The IR absorption in-

tensities are broadened by 6 cm−1 to mimic experimental uncertainties. The
IR spectra of the three isomers have diﬀerent structure. The high symmetry
of the round Øcage results in its IR spectrum with four peaks. It shows a
strong absorption at 1471 cm−1 and a weak absorption at 759 cm−1 . Other
peaks around 950 cm−1 and 500 cm−1 have relative intensity less than 2%.

The strong absorption mode at 1471 cm−1 is three fold degenerate and corre-
sponds to stretching and a compression of the alternate bond in the octagon.
An earlier IR calculation [7] on the ØB24N24 cage that used semi-empirical
modiﬁed neglect of diatomic overlap (MNDO) method reports three very dif-
ferent IR active modes at 1356, 1336, and 772 cm−1 . The IR spectra of S4
can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories of bands in the frequency range
1353-1448 cm−1 . The ﬁrst set consists of small peaks around 1350 cm−1 while
the second set shows three peaks at 1399, 1423, and at 1442-1448 cm−1 . In
the experiment, the later set of peaks may show up as a broad band beginning
with a shoulder around 1350 cm−1 . The IR spectra of the S8 structure exhibits
three conspicuous peaks at 1407, 1432, and 1461 cm−1 . The strongest mode
at 1432 cm−1 corresponds to a compression of two opposite hexagonal bonds
accompanied by simultaneous stretching of remaining hexagonal bonds. The
absorption at 1461 cm−1 is due to the compression and stretching of bonds
of octagons. A small peak is also observed at lower frequency of 767 cm−1
. It corresponds to a vibrational mode that results in puckering of alternate
atoms. The diﬀerences observed in the structure of the predicted IR spectra
of the three isomers indicate the possibility of identifying the isomer by high
resolution IR spectroscopy measurement. A sharp, high-frequency peak would
indicate the presence of the octahedral isomer.

The Raman spectra of the three B24N24 cages are shown in Fig. 3 and the
vibrational frequencies at which signiﬁcant absorption occurs are presented in
Table 4. The Raman spectra of three cages show an interesting feature: all
three cages show an intense absorption in the 420 - 480 cm−1 region. In all
the three structures this mode is an A mode and corresponds to the breathing
motion of the cages. The intensity of this peak is comparable in all the three
structures. The Øcage is marked by an intense double peak in the 131-150 cm−1
region which is not seen in the other two spectra. These peaks are associated
with E and T2 modes. Thus two peaks below 160 cm−1 and another one at

around 430 cm−1 , all with similar intensity will signify a Østructure. On the
other hand, the S4 structure will show three low Raman peaks in the region
190 - 230 cm−1 and three others around 800 cm−1 . In experiment, they may
appear as broad peaks with roughly half the intensity of the most intense
peak at 430 cm−1 . The Østructure also shows a weak absorption around 800

cm−1 . The S8 structure has a low frequency peak around 158 cm−1 which
is about half as intense as the peak at 472 cm−1 , and a similar one at 798
cm−1 . The peak at 158 cm−1 due to a doubly degenerate E mode while the
one at 798 cm−1 has A symmetry. Further it will show a broad band at 230
cm−1 which will be missing in the two other structures. These diﬀerences in
the Raman spectra of the Ø, S4 , and S8 cages may help in identifying them
in the experimental spectra.

To summarize, three candidate structures for the ground state geometry of
the B24N24 are considered. These are, the octahedral structure proposed by
the experimentalists, the S4 cage that satisfy the isolated square rule, and
the S8 symmetric tubule containing two octahedrons and eight squares. The
harmonic frequency analysis indicate all structures to be vibrationally stable.
The S8 tubule and S4 are energetically nearly degenerate and are favored over
the Øcage on the basis of energetics. All the three clusters have wide HOMO-
LUMO gap and high ionization potential. The infra-red and Raman spectra
show notable diﬀerences and therefore point to possible identiﬁcation of the
structure by the IR or Raman spectroscopy. The IR spectra perhaps, as in the
case of C60 [15,16], could guide methods for optimizing the production of the
round cluster.

We present a theoretical and experimental study of an atomic magnetometer operating in geo-
magnetic ﬁeld range based on oscillating ﬁeld-driven Zeeman resonance in a high-density optically-
pumped potassium vapor. We show that the fundamental ﬁeld sensitivity is determined by the rate
of spin-exchange collisions even though the resonance linewidth can be made much smaller than the
spin-exchange rate by pumping most atoms into a stretched spin state. We also describe an experi-

mental implementation of a high-density atomic gradiometer with a noise level below 10 fT Hz

Alkali-metal vapors are used in such vital metrol-
ogy applications as atomic clocks [1] and magnetome-
ters [2, 3, 4]. In these applications the resolution of fre-
quency measurements of the hyperﬁne or Zeeman reso-
nance can be improved by increasing the density of alkali-
metal atoms until the resonance begins to broaden due
to alkali-metal spin-exchange collisions. Such broadening
can be completely eliminated for Zeeman resonance near
zero magnetic ﬁeld [5, 6, 7]. The broadening of the hy-
perﬁne and Zeeman resonances at a ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld
can be reduced by optically pumping the atoms into a
nearly fully polarized state [8, 9, 10]. These techniques
have been used to demonstrate clock resonance narrow-
ing [9] and have led to signiﬁcant improvement in the
sensitivity of atomic magnetometers [11] and to their ap-
plication for detection of magnetic ﬁelds from the brain
[12] and nuclear quadrupole resonance signals from ex-
plosives [13]. However, the eﬀects of spin-exchange colli-
sions on the fundamental sensitivity of atomic clocks and
magnetometers operating in a ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld have
not been analyzed.

∼

Here we study theoretically and experimentally the ef-
fects of spin-exchange collisions in an atomic magnetome-
ter operating in geomagnetic ﬁeld range. It was shown in
[8, 9, 10] that in the limit of weak excitation the Zeeman
and hyperﬁne resonance linewidths can be reduced from
Rse, where Rse is the alkali-metal spin-exchange
∆ν
∼
(RseRsd)1/2, where Rsd is the alkali-metal
rate, to ∆ν
spin-destruction rate, by pumping most of the atoms into
the stretched spin state with maximum angular momen-
tum. Since for alkali-metal atoms Rsd ≪
Rse (for ex-
10−4Rse), this technique can
ample, for K atoms Rsd ∼
reduce the resonance linewidth by a factor of 10
100.
However, the frequency measurement sensitivity depends
not only on the linewidth but also on the amplitude of the
spin precession signal, and the optimal sensitivity is ob-
tained for an excitation amplitude that leads to apprecia-
ble rf broadening. We study the eﬀects of rf broadening in
the presence of non-linear evolution due to spin-exchange
collisions and ﬁnd that the fundamental limit on sensi-
tivity is determined by Rse even when most atoms are
pumped into the stretched spin state and the resonance
linewidth is much narrower than Rse. We derive a simple

−

relationship for the ultimate sensitivity of a scalar alkali-
metal magnetometer, which also applies qualitatively to
atomic clocks.

Scalar magnetometers, which measure the Zeeman res-
onance frequency proportional to the absolute value of
the magnetic ﬁeld, are important in a number of practical
applications, such as mineral exploration [14], searches
for archeological artifacts [15] and unexploded ordnance
[16], as well as in fundamental physics experiments, such
as searches for a CP-violating electric dipole moment [2].
These applications require magnetometers that can mea-
fT) changes in geomagnetic-size ﬁelds with
sure small (
a fractional sensitivity of 10−10
10−11. Existing sensi-
tive scalar magnetometers use large cells ﬁlled only with
alkali-metal vapor and rely on a surface coating to reduce
relaxation of atoms on the walls [2, 3, 4]. However, such
coatings generally cannot be used at high temperature
necessary to obtain high alkali-metal density. We use he-
lium buﬀer gas to reduce diﬀusion of alkali atoms to the
walls, which also allows independent measurements of the
magnetic ﬁeld at several locations in the same cell [11].
We present direct measurements of the magnetic ﬁeld
sensitivity in a gradiometric conﬁguration and demon-
in a 10−5 T static
strate noise level below 10 fT Hz
ﬁeld (1 part in 109) using an active measurement volume
1.5 cm3. A small active volume and absence of del-
V
icate surface coatings opens the possibility of miniatur-
ization and batch fabrication [18] of ultra-sensitive mag-
netometers. The best previously reported direct sensi-
tivity measurement for a scalar magnetometer, using a
comparison of two isotopes of Rb occupying the same
volume V = 180 cm3, had Allan deviation corresponding
to sensitivity of 60 fT Hz−1/2 and fractional sensitivity
10−8 Hz−1/2 [17]. Indirect estimates of scalar mag-
of 5
netometer sensitivity on the order of 1 fT Hz−1/2 have
been reported in cells with V

1000 cm3 [3, 4].

We rely on a simple magnetometer arrangement using
optical pumping with circularly-polarized light parallel to
the static magnetic ﬁeld Bz, excitation of spin coherence
with an oscillating transverse magnetic ﬁeld B1, and de-
tection of spin coherence with a probe beam orthogonal
to the static ﬁeld. RF broadening of magnetic resonance
is usually described by Bloch equations with phenomeno-

logical relaxation times T1 and T2 [19]. It was shown in
[20] that such a description works for alkali-metal atoms
in the presence of spin-exchange collisions for small spin
polarization. However, the general case of large polar-
ization and large rf broadening, which gives the optimal
measurement sensitivity, cannot be described by simple
Bloch equations. To study these eﬀects in more detail
we performed extensive measurements of magnetic ﬁeld
resonance lineshapes in K vapor for a large range of spin-
exchange rates, optical pumping rates, and rf excitation
amplitudes. One result of these measurements is shown
in Fig. 1a, where we plot the linewidth of a Lorentzian
ﬁt to the absorption and dispersion components of the
magnetic resonance as a function of the rf excitation am-
plitude, which is in clear disagreement with simple Bloch
equations (dotted line).

More complete results of our experimental measure-
ments and numerical density matrix simulations will be
presented elsewhere [21]. Here we derive an analytical
result that gives an accurate description of magnetome-
Rsd, where

optical pumping of alkali vapors in the presence of high
density buﬀer gas [22], it can be shown that the trans-
verse spin relaxation time T2 for small spin coherences in
alkali atoms with I = 3/2 is given by

exchange rate and the longitudinal spin polarization
Pz = Rop/(Rop + Rsd) is close to unity [10]. For high
Pz most atoms are pumped into F = 2 hyperﬁne man-
ifold and their precession obeys the Bloch equations.
Since spin-exchange eﬀects are isotropic, Eq. (1) can be

P as a function of rf ﬁeld detuning and other param-
eters. This model based on modiﬁed Bloch equations
reproduces the non-Lorentzian resonance lineshape from
full density matrix simulation shown in Fig. 1b as well as
the experimental rf broadening data shown in Fig. 1a.

potassium in natural abundance, 2.5 atm of 4He to slow

cell is heated to approximately 150◦C with pairs of ohmic

tion. The optical rotation is measured by two balanced
polarimeters using a pair of two-segment photodiodes to
form a gradiometer arrangement.

with its frequency tuned to the Zeeman resonance given
by ω0 = γBz = gsµBBz/(2I + 1)~ = 2π

for potassium atoms. The amplitude of the rf ﬁeld is
about 19 nT. Measurements are made for three values of
Bz ﬁeld: 1 µT, 10 µT, and 26 µT.

×

The polarimeter signals are measured with a lock-in
ampliﬁer (Stanford Research Systems SR830 for 1 and
10 µT measurements, SR844 for the 26 µT measure-
ment). The lock-in internal reference is used to generate
the rf ﬁeld, the phase is adjusted to separate the reso-
nance signal into symmetric absorption and antisymmet-
ric dispersion components, and the time constant is set
to 100 µs. The resonance lineshapes obtained by varying
the rf frequency are shown in Fig. 3. The pump power
and rf amplitude are adjusted to optimize the slope of the
dispersion signal for a given probe beam power. At the
parameters that optimize the magnetometer sensitivity,
the data are well-described by Lorentzians with similar
HWHM for absorbtion and dispersion components of 215
Hz for 1 and 10 µT and 265 Hz for 26 µT and amplitudes
that are nearly independent of the magnetic ﬁeld.

×

The ﬁeld Bz is generated using custom current sources,
based on a mercury battery voltage reference and a FET
input stage followed by a conventional op-amp or a tran-
sistor output stage [23]. The fractional current noise is
10−8 at 10 Hz, about 10 times better than
less than 2
from a Thorlabs LDC201 ULN current source. Low-
frequency (< 10 Hz) optical rotation noise is reduced
by an order of magnitude by covering the optics with
boxes to reduce air circulation. The oven and laser beams
within the magnetic shields are enclosed in a glass vac-
uum chamber to reduce convection. Probe beam focusing
is adjusted to equalize the photodiode signals for two po-
larimeters within 2%. The gradiometer measurements
reduce by more than an order of magnitude the noise
from the Bz current source as well as pump intensity and
lightshift noise. By applying a calibrated magnetic ﬁeld
gradient we ﬁnd the distance between the gradiometer

The magnetic ﬁeld data are acquired from the disper-
sive lock-in signal for 100 sec with a sampling rate of
2 kHz. The FFT of the data is converted to a magnetic
noise spectrum using a frequency calibration of the dis-
persion slope and corrected for ﬁnite bandwidth of the
magnetometer. The bandwidth is found to be equal to
the Lorentzian HWHM for all values of Bz. The mag-
netic noise spectra at 1 and 10 µT are shown in Fig. 4. At
1 µT, single channel measurements are limited by lock-in
phase noise, while at 10 µT they are limited by current
source noise. The gradiometer noise is limited almost
entirely by photon shot noise at higher frequencies and
reaches below 14 fT/Hz
, corresponding to less than
for individual magnetometer channels. With
10 fT/Hz
the pump beam blocked, the optical rotation noise is at
the photon shot noise level. Low frequency noise is most
likely due to remaining eﬀects of convection. At 26 µT,
the gradiometer has a sensitivity of 29 fT/Hz
, limited
by imperfect balance between channels and lock-in noise.
The calculation of the fundamental sensitivity for a
scalar magnetometer follows closely that for an rf atomic
magnetometer, derived in [10]. The magnetic ﬁeld spec-

It is interesting to compare the scaling of the opti-
mal magnetic ﬁeld sensitivities in various regimes.
It
was shown in [11] that near zero ﬁeld in spin-exchange
relaxation free (SERF) regime the sensitivity scales as
1/2
σ
sd , while for an rf magnetometer operating in a ﬁnite
ﬁeld it scales as (σseσsd)1/4 [10]. In contrast, here we ﬁnd
that fundamental sensitivity for a scalar magnetometer
1/2
se , i.e. there is no signiﬁcant
in a ﬁnite ﬁeld scales as σ
reduction of spin-exchange broadening for optimal con-
ditions. Since σse is similar for all alkali metals, one can
expect a similar sensitivity for a Cs or Rb magnetome-
ter. On the other hand, if one is limited by the photon
shot noise or technical sources of noise, which is often the
case in practical systems, the magnetometer sensitivity
is improved because the slope of the dispersion resonance
, instead of σ−1
scales as σ
se . We expect similar
relationships, with diﬀerent numerical factors, to hold for
atomic clocks operating on the end transitions, since T2
in that case is given by an equation similar to Eq. (1) [9].
In conclusion, we have systematically studied spin-
exchange eﬀects in a scalar alkali-metal magnetometer.
We considered the eﬀects of rf broadening and showed
that the best sensitivity for an alkali-metal magnetome-
ter with a 1 cm3 measurement volume is on the order of
1 fT/√Hz. We also demonstrated experimentally mag-
netic ﬁeld sensitivity below 10 fT/√Hz with an active
volume of only 1.5 cm3, opening the possibility for fur-
ther miniaturization of alkali-metal magnetometers. This
work was supported by an ONR MURI grant.

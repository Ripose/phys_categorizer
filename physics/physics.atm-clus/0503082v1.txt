Abstract

The two published lithium peroxide structures, both
ascribed to the hexagonal P 6 space group, were sub-
jected to reinterpretation and another more symmet-
ric structure, now belonging to the P 63/mmc space
group, was found. Detailed density-functional quan-
tum mechanical calculations and crystal structure op-
timisations were carried out on both structures and
the energetic arguments obtained therewith helped
to rule out one of them.

Introduction

Despite its use as an oxidizing agent, as a regener-
ator for conﬁned breathable atmospheres and as a
fuel cell material, lithium peroxide has seemingly not
been suﬃciently studied, to the point that even its
crystalline structure has not been unambiguously de-
termined.

Crystallographic databases give two diﬀerent ac-
counts of the lithium peroxide structure, the ﬁrst
one proposed by F´eher et al. (1953), and the other
one by F¨oppl (1957). Whether these two structures
represent isomorphs is not substantiated by experi-
mental evidence other than the interpretation of X-
ray diﬀraction data, which is not entirely suitable for

lithium compounds due to the fact that lithium is a
poor X-ray scatterer. Therefore, since the issue of
deciding for either one of the proposed structures is
not completely resolved, further argumentation is in
order.

In the course of a density functional, quantum me-
chanical study of lithium peroxide, we found out
that both proposed structures could be better ac-
counted for by another more symmetric hexagonal
space group. On the other hand, optimisation of
atomic coordinates and cell parameters shows that
the F¨oppl structure is substantially more favourable
in terms of energy and in terms of its ability to re-
produce the experimental X-ray spectrum of the per-
oxide.

This study relies on the fact that modern high-
quality DFT calculations are nowadays very much
able to make not only qualitative but also accurate
quantitative predictions.

2 Calculation details

calculations were

carried out using the
The
WIEN2k code (Blaha et al., 2001), which is a
full potential-linearised augmented plane wave (FP-
LAPW) method based on the density functional the-
ory (DFT). The generalised gradient approximation
(Perdew et al., 1996) was used for the treatment of
the exchange-correlation interactions. The number of
k-points used was 1000 (72 in the irreducible wedge).

For the number of plane waves the applied criterion
was Rmax
MT × K max = 8 (muﬃn-tin radius and maxi-
mum number of plane waves, respectively). The same
RMT was used for each atom in all the crystal struc-
tures, RMT (Li) = 1.8 a.u., RMT (O) = 1.4 a.u., ex-
cept for the original F´eher et al.
structure, where
RMT (O) = 1.2 a.u., was used. The space group
analysis was done with the program sgroup (Yanchit-
sky & Timoshevskii, 2001) contained in the WIEN2k
package. For the crystal structure visualisation the
XCrySDen package (Kokalj, 1999) was used.

3 Discussion

3.1 Crystal structure simpliﬁcation

The crystal structure of lithium peroxide was re-
ported some 50 years ago by F´eher et al., (from now
on Str1),
in 1953, and by F¨oppl, (from now on
Str2), in 1957. Both authors proposed their respec-
tive structural models based on the good agreement
with their respective X-ray data. F¨oppl, however,
based on a systematic study of several alkali perox-
ides, claimed that his structural assignment was more
in accordance with the general peroxide construction
principles, although he provided no further evidence
pertaining to lithium peroxide itself.

Str1 is presented in Table 1. From the atomic po-
sitions it can be readily seen that, by shifting the
three Li 3 atoms by half cell in the a or b direction,
they fall into the Li 1 positions, and the same is valid
for the other atoms, such that Li 4 becomes Li 2, O 3
becomes O 1 and O 4 becomes O 2. This clearly sug-
gests that the unit cell can be reduced to a′ = a/2
and b′ = b/2 (a′ = b′ = 3.1525 ˚A), the 2 g (0 0 z)
positions remain the same, and the 2 i (1/3 -1/3 z)
positions change to 2 d (-1/3 1/3 z). The reduced
structure is therefore as in Table 2.

This simpler cell, with only 4 lithiums and 4 oxy-
gens has no inversion symmetry. However, by shifting
all atoms by (1/3 -1/3 1/4) Li 1 and Li 2 are now con-
nected by inversion, as well as O 1 and O 2. The new
cell belongs to a diﬀerent space group, as is shown in
Table 3.

Lithium atoms are arranged in the wurtzite struc-

ture, which is similar to the h.c.p. (hexagonal
close packed) structure, but instead of having al-
ternating triangular layers, BCBC...,
the layers
are repeated twice, BBCCBBCC.... At the same
time, oxygen atoms occupy alternate sites, that is,
CCBBCCBB...; therefore, the new structure can be
viewed as two interpenetrating wurtzite structures,
one shifted from the other by 1/2 cell in the c direc-
tion. This is indeed an open structure with the A sites
vacant.
In this structure the vertical distances be-
tween two lithiums and between two oxygens cannot
be determined by symmetry (these distances, which
will be referred to as 2α, are 2α(Li) = 0.316 (2.43 ˚A),
and 2α(O) = 0.166 (1.28 ˚A)).

Str2 is presented in Table 4. Again, inversion sym-
metry can be incorporated by shifting the atoms by
(1/3 -1/3 1/4). Now Li 1 and Li 2 are connected by
inversion and both therefore become Li 2, Li 3 be-
comes Li 1, and ﬁnally also O 1 and O 2 are con-
nected by inversion. The new cell is shown in Ta-
ble 5. As can be seen, this structure is quite simi-
lar to the reduced Str1 cell (Table 3), where oxygen
ions have the same 4 f position, but with a larger
separation, 2α(O) = 0.204 (1.56 ˚A). Lithium atoms,
however, have diﬀerent positions:
instead of being
on the oxygen planes they are between the planes.
The arrangement can be described as AcBcAbCbA,
where capital letters refer to lithium and small let-
ters to oxygen. This can be seen as a close packed
arrangement, compressed in the c direction. The se-
quence BcAbC forms a cubic close packed arrange-
ment (ccp), followed by the reverse sequence, CbAcB,
which also forms a ccp arrangment. Therefore, Str2
can be regarded as mirrored layers of ccp arrange-
ments. Lithium atoms by themselves form a close
packed structure, ABACA, which is still compressed
in the c-direction, with c/a = 2.43, compared to the
ideal hard sphere packing of 3.26.

3.2 Crystal structure optimisation

To elucidate whether these two crystal structures rep-
resent isomorphs of Li2O2, electronic structure cal-
culations were performed on the symmetry-optimised
version of each peroxide structure. Both structures
were found to be strained (i.e., the calculations

2

showed that there were non-negligible net forces act-
ing on the atoms), therefore, a full optimisation of the
atomic coordinates and cell parameters was granted.

3.2.1 F´eher et al. structure, Str1.

This structure showed large forces on its atoms, with
F (Li) = −10 mRy/a.u. and F (O) = −374 mRy/a.u,
(Ry: Rydberg = 13.6 eV) according to our cal-
culations. Relaxing the atomic coordinates (un-
til the forces became negligible, that is, less than
1 mRy/a.u.) produced drastic changes (see Table 6):
there is a total energy reduction of −0.11 Ry, whereas
the O–O bond lenght increases from 1.28 ˚A to 1.50 ˚A.
On his part, F¨oppl argued that such a short 1.28 ˚A
O–O bond in the F´eher et al.
structure would re-
produce the X-ray diﬀraction pattern well. However,
in analogy with his homologous peroxide determina-
tions, F¨oppl concluded that this O–O bond should be
of the order of 1.5 ˚A, and with such large bond the X-
ray diﬀraction pattern would be discernibly diﬀerent.
Therefore, according to F¨oppl, Str1 must be wrong.
Full optimisation of this structure was carried out
in sucessive cycles of force, cell volume and c/a op-
timisation steps.
In the last cycle the changes in
cell volume and c/a were 0.39 % and 0.29 %, respec-
tively. The ﬁnal forces were F (Li) = 1.3 mRy/a.u.
and F (O) = 2.8 mRy/a.u. The optimisation after
the relaxation of the atomic coordinates did not have
such a large impact on the energy or on the O–O
bond lenght, but produced a considerable 15 % cell
volume increase and a 2.7 % reduction in the c/a ra-
tio. Such large discrepancies with the originally re-
ported experimental values must necessarily entail a
misinterpretation of the X-ray diﬀraction measure-
ments, which should perhaps have been evident even
in the 1953 X-ray diﬀraction patterns.

3.2.2 F¨oppl structure, Str2.

Our calculations show that there is a moderate force
on the oxygen atom, of 11 mRy/a.u., in this structure.
Full optimisation of the structure (see Table 7) pro-
duces a moderate volume increase of 3.6 % and some
other quite small changes: −1.8 mRy total energy re-
duction, an O–O bond length reduced from 1.56 ˚A

to 1.55 ˚A and a c/a ratio change of 0.31 %. The
changes in volume and c/a were 0.22% and 0.15%,
respectively, in the last cycle of optimisation. The
ﬁnal force was F (O) = 1.6 mRy/a.u.

There is a large initial energy diﬀerence between
Str2 and Str1 of −110 mRy/peroxide unit, which re-
duces after optimisation to only −39 mRy/peroxide.
However, this energy diﬀerence is still large enough
(Fournier, 1993), which constitutes further evidence
that lithium peroxide does not have the Str1 struc-
ture.

Therefore, our results show that lithium peroxide
has the same crystal structure proposed by F¨oppl,
but now with inversion symmetry (space group 194)
and slightly modiﬁed atomic positions (Figure 1 and
Table 5). The optimized structure has the following
cell parameters: a = 3.1830 ˚A and c = 7.7258 ˚A, with
α = 1.003 (instead of α = 1.02).

4 Conclusions

Two crystal structures have been proposed for
lithium peroxide. These structures were formerly as-
cribed to the space group P 6 (SG #174).
It was
found that they could be better described by the
P 63/mmc space group (SG #194).

The results presented in this work, from calcu-
lations performed with high-quality DFT codes,
oﬀer a strong argument against the viability of the
structure proposed by F´eher et al.
in 1953. They
do, however, conﬁrm the correctness of the structure
proposed by F¨oppl. Furthermore, on these grounds,
it was possible to present improved values for the
Li2O2 cell parameters.

The authors wish to thank the valuable insight
provided by professors Miguel Castro and Gustavo
Taviz´on, of the Facultad de Qu´ımica, UNAM.

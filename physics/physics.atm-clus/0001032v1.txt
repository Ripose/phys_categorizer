N and Ag

Second electron aﬃnities of AuN and AgN clusters and
2−
the dissociation energies for ﬁssion of the Au
N
dianions are calculated using the ﬁnite-temperature shell-
correction method and allowing for triaxial deformations. Di-
anionic clusters with N > 2 are found to be energetically
stable against ﬁssion, leaving electron autodetachment as the
dominant decay process. The second electron aﬃnities exhibit
pronounced shell eﬀects in excellent agreement with measured
abundance spectra for Au2−
N (N < 30), with appearance sizes
a (Au)= 12 and n2−
n2−

a (Ag)= 24.

Unlike the case of multiply charged cationic species,
the production and observation of gas-phase doubly an-
ionic aggregates had remained for many years a chal-
lenging experimental goal. However, with the availabil-
ity of large carbon clusters (which can easily accomo-
date the repulsion between the two excess electrons) this
state of aﬀairs changed, including observation of doubly
negative fullerenes,1 C2−
60 , and fullerene derivatives,2 as
well as a recent measurement of the photoelectron spec-
trum of the citric acid dianion.3 Moreover, such obser-
vations are not limited to carbon based aggregates and
organic molecules, with a ﬁrst observation of doubly an-
ionic metal clusters (speciﬁcally gold clusters) reported4,5
most recently. A few theoretical studies of multiply
charged anionic fullerenes6,7 and alkali-metal (sodium)
clusters8 have also appeared, but overall the ﬁeld of mul-
tiply anionic aggregates remains at an embryonic stage.
In this paper, we investigate the stability and decay
channels of Au2−
N at ﬁnite temperature, and
determine their appearance sizes n2−
(clusters with N <
a
n2−
are energetically unstable). Two decay channels of
a
doubly anionic clusters need to be considered: (i) binary
ﬁssion,

N and Ag2−

which has a well known analog in the case of doubly
cationic clusters,9–11 and (ii) electron autodetachment
via emission through a Coulombic barrier,8

Our main conclusion is that, unlike the case of doubly
cationic metal clusters,9,11 ﬁssion of Au2−
N is
not a dominant process, and that the appearance sizes
of these doubly anionic clusters are determined by elec-
tron autodetachment. Our results for the second electron
aﬃnities exhibit pronounced electronic shell eﬀects and
are in excellent agreement with most recent experimen-
tal data5 for Au2−
N , we predict
n2−
a = 24.
The ﬁnite-temperature multiple electron aﬃnities of a
cluster of N atoms of valence v (we take v = 1 for Au
and Ag) are deﬁned as

a = 12. For Ag2−

N with n2−

AZ (N, β) = F (β, vN, vN + Z − 1) − F (β, vN, vN + Z) ,

(3)

where F is the free energy, β = 1/kBT , and Z ≥ 1
is the number of excess electrons in the cluster (e.g.,
the ﬁrst and second aﬃnities correspond to Z = 1 and
Z = 2, respectively). To determine the free energy, we
use the shell correction method. In the SCM, F is sepa-
e
rated into a smooth liquid-drop-model (LDM) part
FLDM
(varying monotonically with N ), and a Strutinsky-type
shell-correction term ∆Fsp = Fsp − e
Fsp, where Fsp is the
canonical (ﬁxed N at a given T ) free energy of the valence
electrons, treated as independent single particles mov-
ing in an eﬀective mean-ﬁeld potential (approximated
by a modiﬁed Nilsson hamiltonian pertaining to triax-
e
Fsp is the Strutinsky-averaged
ial cluster shapes), and
e
free energy. The smooth
FLDM contains volume, sur-
face, and curvature contributions, whose coeﬃcients are
determined as described in Ref. 14, with experimental
values and temperature dependencies. In addition to the
ﬁnite-temperature contribution due to the electronic en-
tropy, the entropic contribution from thermal shape ﬂuc-
tuations is evaluated via a Boltzmann averaging.14(a)

We note here that the smooth contribution

e
AZ (N, β)
to the full multiple electron aﬃnities AZ (N, β) can be
approximated8 by the LDM expression

with an analogy to proton and alpha decay in
atomic nuclei.12,13 The theoretical approach we use
is a ﬁnite-temperature semi-empirical shell-correction
method (SCM), which incorporates triaxial shapes and
which has been previously used successfully to describe
the properties of neutral and cationic metal clusters.14

where R(N ) = rsN 1/3 is the radius of the positive back-
ground (rs is the Wigner-Seitz radius which depends
weakly on T due to volume dilation), γ = 5/8, δ0 is
an electron spillout parameter, and the work function
W is assumed to be temperature independent [we take
W (Au)= 5.31 eV and W (Ag)= 4.26 eV].

In a recent experiment,5 singly anionic gold clusters
−
N (N ≤ 28) were stored in a Penning trap, size se-
Au
lected, and transformed into dianions, Au2−
N , through ir-
radiation by an electron beam. The measured5 relative
intensity ratios of the dianions to their monoanionic pre-
cursors are reproduced in Fig. 1(a); they exhibit size-
evolutionary patterns (arising from electronic shell ef-
fects) reminiscent of those found earlier in the mass abun-
dance spectra,
ionization potentials and ﬁrst electron
aﬃnities of alkali- and coinage-metal clusters.15 Since the
stability of the dianions relative to their monoanionic pre-
cursors depends on the second electron aﬃnity A2, it may
be expected that A2 and the relative signal intensity of
the Au2−
N clusters will exhibit correlated patterns as a
function of size. Here we note that stable dianions must
have A2 > 0, whereas those with A2 < 0 are unstable and
decay via process (ii), i.e., via electron emission through
a Coulombic barrier8 (see below).

In Fig. 1(b), we display the SCM theoretical
results16,17 for the second electron aﬃnity of AuN clus-
ters in the size range 10 ≤ N ≤ 30. These results cor-
relate remarkably well with the measured relative abun-
dance spectrum [see Fig. 1(a)]. Note in particular: (i) the
observed and predicted appearance size n2−
a (Au)= 12;
(ii) the relative instability of Au2−

sence in Fig. 1(a) and the negative A2 value in Fig. 1(b)

Fig. 1(b)(that is, even-odd alternations for N ≤ 19 with
a sole discrepancy at N = 15, and the monotonic behav-
ior for N ≥ 19). Underlying the pattern shown in Fig.
1(b) are electronic shell eﬀects [compare in Fig. 1(b) the
shell-corrected results indicated by the solid line with the
LDM curve] combined with energy-lowering shape defor-
mations of the clusters (which are akin to Jahn-Teller
distortions and are associated with the lifting of spectral
degeneracies for open-shell cluster sizes).

To explore the energetic stability of the Au2−

N clus-
ters against binary ﬁssion [see Eq. (1)], we show in Fig.
2(a) SCM results, at selected cluster sizes (N = 7, 14
and 21), for the ﬁssion dissociation energies ∆N,P =
F (Au
N ), with the total free en-
ergies of the parent dianion and the singly-charged ﬁs-
sion products calculated at T = 300 K. For all Au2−
N
parent clusters, the energetically favorable channel (low-
est ∆N,P ) corresponds to P = 1 (i.e., one of the ﬁssion

N −P ) − F (Au2−

products is the closed-shell Au− anion). The inﬂuence of
shell eﬀects on the ﬁssion dissociation energies is evident
particularly in cases where the ﬁssion channel involves
closed-shell magic products (see P = 7, and equivalently
P = 14, for N = 21, and the pronounced eﬀect at P = 7
for N = 14 where both ﬁssion products are magic). The
ﬁssion results summarized in Fig. 2(b) for the most fa-
vorable channel (P = 1) illustrate that exothermic ﬁs-
sion (that is ∆N,P < 0) is predicted to occur only for the
smallest size (N = 2). This, together with the existence
of a ﬁssion barrier, leads us to conclude that the decay
of Au2−
N clusters is dominated by the electron autode-
tachment process (which is operative when A2 < 0 and
involves tunneling through a Coulomb barrier8), rather
than by ﬁssion.

Finally, we show in Fig. 3 SCM results for the sec-
ond electron aﬃnity [A2 in Fig. 3(a)] and the ﬁssion dis-
sociation energies [∆N,P in Fig. 3(b)] corresponding to
the most favorable channel (P = 1) for silver dianionic
clusters Ag2−
N . Again binary ﬁssion is seen to be en-
dothermic except for N = 2, and the appearance size for
Ag2−
N (i.e., the smallest size with A2 > 0) is predicted to
be n2−
a (Ag)= 24. The shift of the appearance size to a
larger value than that found for gold dianionic clusters
[that is n2−
a (Au)= 12, see above] can be traced to the
smaller work function of silver, as can be seen from the
LDM curves calculated through the use of Eq. (4) with
Z = 2.18

16 For the rather small AuN and AgN clusters discussed here
(N ≤ 30 and N ≤ 40, respectively), our results at T = 0 K
and T = 300 K diﬀer only slightly. Since, however, the ex-
periments are carried out at ﬁnite temperatures, we present
here the T = 300 K results for the sake of completeness.
For cases where the SCM reveals signiﬁcant thermal eﬀects
portrayed by reduction and smearing out of electronic shell
eﬀects (e.g., for higher temperatures and/or larger rs’s as
in the case of NaN and KN clusters), see Ref. 14(a).

17 The T = 0 parameters entering in the SCM calculation
[for deﬁnitions of these, see Ref. 14(b)] are: (i) In the case
of AuZ−
N clusters, U0 = −0.045, rs = 3.01 a.u., t = 0.37
a.u., δ0 = 1.31 a.u., δ2 = 0, W = 5.31 eV, αv = −8.06
eV, αs = 2.52 eV, and αc = 1.04 eV; (ii) In the case of
AgZ−
N clusters, U0 = −0.045, rs = 3.01 a.u., t = 0.47
a.u., δ0 = 1.31 a.u., δ2 = 0, W = 4.26 eV, αv = −8.06
eV, αs = 2.05 eV, and αc = 0.86 eV. Experimental val-
ues were used for the liquid-drop parameters for the sur-
face tension, αs, and for the work function, W . αv and
δ0 were speciﬁed through a ﬁt to extended-Thomas-Fermi
total energy calculations for spherical clusters in conjunc-
tion with a stabilized-jellium-LDA energy functional [see
J.P. Perdew, H.Q. Tran, and E.D. Smith, Phys. Rev. B
42, 11 627 (1990)]. The curvature coeﬃcient, αc, was spec-
iﬁed by assuming that its ratio over the stabilized-jellium

value is the same as the ratio between the experimental
and stabilized-jellium values for the surface tension. The
need to use experimental values for αs, αc, and W arises
from the fact that the stabilized-jellium-LDA omits con-
tributions from the d-electrons and thus does not provide
accurate values for the surface tension and the work func-
tion of gold and silver. The mass of the delocalized valence
s-electrons was taken equal to the free-electron mass. The
experimental temperature dependence of the surface ten-
sion and the coeﬃcient of linear thermal expansion were
taken from standard tables as elaborated in Ref. 14(a).
18 The use of a ﬁnite value [see Ref. 14(b)] for the spillout
parameter δ0 in the case of negatively charged clusters is
crucial for obtaining accurate results. Taking δ0 = 0 (as
was done in Ref. 5) yields a higher value for the appearance
sizes.

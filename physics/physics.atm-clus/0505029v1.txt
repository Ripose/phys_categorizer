The diﬀusion Monte Carlo technique is used to calculate and analyze the excitation spectrum of
3He atoms bound to a cluster of 4He atoms, by using a previously determined optimum ﬁlling of
single-fermion orbits with well deﬁned orbital angular momentum L, spin S and parity quantum
numbers. The study concentrates on the energies and shapes of the three kinds of states for which
the fermionic part of the wave function is a single Slater determinant: maximum L or maximum
S states within a given orbit, and fully polarized clusters. The picture that emerges is that of
systems with strong shell eﬀects whose binding and excitation energies are essentially determined
by averages over conﬁguration at ﬁxed number of particles and spin, i.e., by the monopole properties
of an eﬀective Hamiltonian.

INTRODUCTION

The study of liquid helium in conﬁned geometries is
currently an active area of experimental and theoretical
research.1,2 Helium droplets are weakly bound quantum
systems, as a consequence of their small atomic mass and
the particular form of the associated van der Waals in-
teraction. For 4He, clusters are bound for any number of
atoms, while for 3He, it takes about 30 − 32 atoms3,4 to
form a bound system, due to the larger zero-point motion
and the Pauli Principle. The case of mixed 3He-4He clus-
ters is very interesting, since they are made of particles
with diﬀerent statistics and masses interacting through
the same potential. The theoretical calculations predict
the existence of instability islands for a suﬃciently small
number of 4He atoms.5,6,7,8

Experimentally, small helium clusters are produced by
free jet expansion of the gas. Their mass is then measured
by diﬀraction through a transmission grating followed by
a mass spectrometer detector.9 Pure 4He clusters, con-
taining up to eight atoms, and mixed clusters, containing
one 3He and up to six 4He atoms, have been detected us-
ing a grating with 100 nm period,10 and even the very
weakly bound dimer 4He2 has been unambiguously de-
tected.11 The experimental setup of Ref. 9 has been im-
proved to detect droplet sizes up to 25-30 amu, and very
small mixed systems have been deﬁnitely identiﬁed.12

There have been several theoretical studies of a single
3He atom in a medium size 4He cluster, either through
a density functional approach13,14 or microscopic meth-
3He clusters form bound states
ods.15,16,17 All 4HeNB
for NB ≥ 2. The excess in kinetic energy pushes the

3He atom to the surface, resulting in a a quasi two-
dimensional wave function similar to the Andreev state
describing one 3He impurity in 4He bulk. Recently, the
ordering of the single-particle orbital states has been es-
tablished.18 Larger combinations of 3He and 4He atoms
have been studied employing a non-local ﬁnite range den-
sity functional.14,19,20 Previous variational microscopic
studies of these mixed systems have been carried out for
3He2 cluster,21 and for clusters with NB ≤ 8,
the 4He2
NF ≤ 20.5 More recently, the diﬀusion Monte Carlo
(DMC) method has been applied to droplets with NF ≤
3, NB ≤ 17 in Refs. 6,7, and with NF ≤ 20, NB ≤ 8
in Ref. 8. The most important result from microscopic
calculations5,8 is the prediction of instability regions, spe-
cially when the number of 4He atoms is small; neverthe-
less, a core with ﬁve or more 4He atoms is able to bind
any number NF of 3He atoms.

Our purpose is to analyze the ground state and the
low-lying excited states of the 3He atoms in a mixed he-
lium droplet, by using the DMC method, and relying
on the single-particle orbital orderings obtained previ-
ously18 from the study of a single fermion. The resulting
spacings resemble those of the rotational spectrum of a
diatomic molecule, where the 4He core plays the role of
one atom and the 3He is the other atom. At low energies
each level is uniquely classiﬁed by its angular momentum,
but vibrational-like excitations appear at higher energies
for heavy enough clusters. The adopted ﬁlling order for
large number of 3He atoms is therefore 1s 1p 1d . . . ,
with some attention being paid to a possible 2s intruder.
We shall concentrate on clusters with eight and twenty
bosons, varying the number of fermions. This moderately

large number of bosons ensures the existence of several
bound excited levels. All calculations have been made
using the HFD-(B) potential of Aziz and co-workers22
for the He-He interaction.

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section II we
give some general details concerning the DMC calcula-
tion. Section III collects single-fermion results needed
later. Section IV deals with the case of two fermions:
this system is simple enough to be analyzed in depth for
a large set of quantum numbers, shedding light in partic-
ular on the single-particle ordering. Section V is devoted
to stable mixed clusters, for the speciﬁc cases of max-
imum spin and maximum orbital angular momentum.
The case of fully polarized clusters is also considered. In
Section VI we exhibit the calculated one- and two-body
distribution functions, both for normal and fully polar-
ized mixed clusters. Finally, in Section VII we summarize
our ﬁndings and draw some general conclusions.

II. THE DIFFUSION MONTE CARLO METHOD

The DMC23,24 method is based on an importance sam-
pling wave function, with the double role of controlling
the variance of the ground state energy and to incorpo-
rate both the required statistics and the desired spin and
angular momentum quantum numbers. In this work we
use the same form employed previously.8 The trial wave
function is written as the product of four factors,

ΨT = ΦBBΦBF ΦF F DF

(1)

corresponding to a Jastrow form for the boson-boson
(BB), boson-fermion (BF ), and fermion-fermion (F F )
parts, and the Slater determinantal part DF for the
fermions. Each Jastrow term is a translationally invari-
ant and symmetric wave function, with the structure

ΦMN =

efM N (rij )

Yi,j

(2)

where indices M, N represent bosons (B) or fermions (F ),
and indices i, j run over the corresponding atoms. The
product runs over all diﬀerent pairs i < j if M = N , and
no restrictions apply when M 6= N . We have used a sim-
ple but nevertheless physically complete representation

2

The last factor DF in the trial wave function is the
determinantal part, which will be discussed later on for
each speciﬁc case. The description of the trial wave func-
tion is completed by the inclusion of the Feynman-Cohen
backﬂow25 in the fermionic exponential tail as well as
in the radial dependence of the Slater factor. Following
Ref. 26, we have replaced each fermion coordinate ri by
a transformed coordinate

ˆri = ri +

η(rij ) (ri − rj )

(4)

Xi6=j

For the backﬂow function η(r) we choose the medium-
range form used in Ref. 27:

η(r) =

λ
r3

(5)

keping the same value for the parameter λ = 5 ˚A3.

Using the model described above for the importance
sampling guiding function, a real-time DMC evolution
has been carried out employing a O(τ 3) approximation
to the Green function, with time slice τ = 0.00025 K−1,
for a total of 200 blocks of 200 steps each. A block av-
erage was used in order to diminish the unavoidable cor-
relations of the DMC method, with the aim of obtaining
a reasonable estimate of the variance. An initial pop-
ulation of 1000 walkers lead, on the average, to a total
number of forty millions samples.

In spite of this block averaging, the resulting estimate
of the variance turned out to be quite optimistic, i.e.,
much smaller than reasonably expected. As a conse-
quence, we opted for a very costly but safe procedure,
by carrying out ten independent calculations with the
same time slice and the same number of samples, but
with randomly selected initial set of walkers. The result-
ing ten results lead to the true variance (or so we hope).
The numbers quoted in what follows correspond to this
prescription.

Due to the presence of the Slater determinants, the im-
portance sampling function is not deﬁnite positive. In our
calculations, the random process has been constrained
using the so-called ﬁxed node approximation: any walker
attempting to cross a nodal surface is neglected. As it
has been shown,29,30 the use of this approximation leads
to an upper bound to the lowest energies.

depending on three parameters, b, p and ν, in general dif-
ferent for each of the three BB, BF and F F pairs. The
short range coeﬃcients b and ν have been ﬁxed, indepen-
dently of the number of bosons or fermions, to the values
ν = 5.2 for any subset M N , bBB = 2.95 ˚A, bBF = 2.90 ˚A,
and bF F = 2.85 ˚A. The long range part r pMN entering
Eq. (3), has the role of conﬁning the system and ﬁxing
roughly its size. The three parameters pMN are adjusted
for each droplet by minimizing its ground state energy.

The system made of a single 3He atom plus a drop of
4He atoms has been recently investigated.18 For the sake
of completeness we summarize in this section the most
relevant results for the analysis of systems with more
fermions.

As there is only one fermion, the Slater determinant in
Eq. (1) becomes a single-particle wave function φnℓm(r)
of radial quantum number n and orbital angular momen-
tum ℓ with projection m. Translational invariance is en-

sured by referring the fermion coordinate to the bosonic
center of mass.

Diﬀerent values of ℓ select a speciﬁc angular momen-
tum subspace in which the DMC procedure will drive the
wave function so as to minimize the energy. Thus, the
radial part of the fermionic wave function can be taken
to have the form

φ1ℓm(r) = rℓYℓm(ˆr),

(6)

which ensures that there are no radial nodes (n = 1).
These single-particle wave functions do not contain a ra-
dial conﬁning term, because it is already included in the
Jastrow part of the importance sampling wave function.
Notice that within the DMC procedure it is not possi-
ble to obtain excited levels with n > 1, because this will
require to impose a strict orthogonality on the physical
n = 0 ground state. Nevertheless, one may use an indi-
rect procedure based in the moment method which will
provide an upper bound to the energy of the radial ex-
cited levels.

Table I displays the energy of these one-fermion states,
as a function of the single-fermion quantum numbers.
The quoted energies are slightly diﬀerent from those
of Ref. 18 because of the improved statistics of the
present calculation. The ground state energies of the
pure bosonic droplets are also given, so as to deﬁne the
separation energies

also quoted in the Table. Positive values refer to unbound
levels. The energy obtained for the n = 2, ℓ = 0 excited
level is above the dissociation limit for NB = 8 or very
close to it for NB = 20.

The single-particle wave functions of Eq. (6) will be
used later to construct model wave functions for systems
with two or more fermions. Unfortunately the moment
method does not provide a wave function for the radial
excitation, and for the calculations of the following sec-
tions we will use the simple form

φn=2,ℓ=0(r) = r2,

(8)

without any radial node. The lack of nodes may be a de-
ﬁciency, but the truly important point is that the simple
form chosen is linearly independent of the 1s state.

IV. THE TWO FERMION SYSTEM

Adding two 3He atoms to a core of 4He atoms results
in a system deeply resembling the helium atom. To a
large extent, the bosonic sub-cluster plays the role of the
atomic nucleus, with the two 3He atoms corresponding
to the electrons. There are two families of levels, sin-
glet (S = 0) and triplet (S = 1). Each of the states
is characterized by the conﬁguration, the orbital angular
momentum L, the spin S and the parity P .

Speciﬁc two-fermion states are constructed from the
single-particle wave functions (6) by coupling the angu-
lar momentum part to the required quantum numbers
and by symmetrizing the singlet or antisymmetrizing the
triplet radial wave functions. In general one does not ob-
tain real wave functions, but the remedy is simple. For
M = 0 the result is real. Otherwise construct two cases
for M and −M and either add or subtract them. The
wave function thus constructed has no good Lz, but still
good total orbital angular momentum, and should have
no eﬀect on the computed energy.

For the sake of completeness we list in Table II the

The energies obtained from these conﬁgurations are
displayed in Table III, for NB = 8 and NB = 20. Some
among these results lie above the dissociation limit (i.e.,
the energy of the lowest bound state with the same num-
ber of bosons but with a single fermion) and do not cor-
respond strictly to truly bound systems.

It has to be understood that in the results quoted in
these two tables, only a single number per row does have
a physical sense: the DMC algorithm improves system-
atically the importance sampling wave function, but be-
cause of the use of the ﬁxed-node approximation, that
improvement only provides a variational upper bound to
the energy for each of the subspaces with well deﬁned L,
S and P quantum numbers. To give an example: the
state 1S may have projections on the 1s2, 1p2, 1d2 and

other shell-model states, but the mixing will probably
not be constructed along the DMC stochastic procedure.
Thence, the DMC physically relevant results are those
with larger value of the binding energy for each row. The
other conﬁgurations with smaller energy are possible in-
teracting conﬁgurations, and presumably an optimized
linear combination within each row could provide a bet-
ter binding energy.

Note that among the states involving the 2s shell none
of them has maximum binding except 1s2s :3S because
the conﬁguration is unique. For NB = 8 this level is not
bound, but it is the last bound one for NB = 20. For the
other cases the DMC optimized energies prefer 1s over
2s orbits, but 1s2s :3S survives because 1s2 :3S violates
the exclusion principle.

Concentrating on the normal shells (1s, 1p, 1d) it ap-
pears that the binding energies depend basically on the
conﬁguration, and are almost independent of the cou-
pling within the conﬁguration. Figs. 1 and 2 give an idea
of this near independence, both for energies and radii.
Within a central-ﬁeld shell-model description, this fact
indicates that the residual interaction between the two
3He atoms is very small, with energies close to the ones

E(n1ℓ1, n2ℓ2) = E0 + ǫn1ℓ1 + ǫn2ℓ2,

where E0 is the energy of the boson core and ǫnℓ the
separation energies deﬁned in Eq. (7) and given in Table
I. The corresponding values appear in the last row of
Table III, with the exception of the last column, the 1p2s
conﬁguration which actually has evolved close to the 1s1p
conﬁguration.

The rough picture of the two-fermion drops as basi-
cally non-interacting fermions bound to a rigid 4He clus-
ter will be reﬁned in Section VI by introducing an eﬀec-
tive monopole interaction.

V. CLUSTERS WITH MORE THAN TWO
FERMIONS: BINDING ENERGIES

In this Section we consider selected states with a ﬁxed
number of bosons and an increasing number of fermions,
up to 18 for normal clusters, i.e., with fermions with spin
up and down, and up to 9 for fully polarized clusters, with
only spin up fermions.

A. The Slater determinant

The fermionic factor DF must have good angular mo-
mentum and spin quantum numbers, and it must be
properly antisymmetrized and translationally invariant.
We take it to be a product of two Slater determinants,
one for each spin orientation. The obvious way to build
them up is with single-particle functions φnℓm generated
by a central ﬁeld which dictates a natural ﬁlling order. In
general, good total orbital angular momentum L and to-
tal spin S demand a linear combination of determinants.
If we insist on a single product, the construction is quite
cumbersome for shells with high ℓ (see e.g. Ref. 28),
though simple when dealing with s and p shells.

The main problem in establishing a reasonable shell-
model description of a system containing 3He atoms,
both in pure as well as in mixed drops, is the lack of phe-
nomenological information about the central ﬁeld. There
are two familiar schemes common to other fermionic
systems: the shell ordering 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p . . . , charac-
teristic of atoms, and the harmonic oscillator sequence
1s, 1p, (2s, 1d), (2p, 1f ) . . . , used in light and medium
atomic nuclei. The principal quantum number follows
diﬀerent rules in both schemes. For the latter the paren-
thesis indicate degenerate orbitals.

In the previous Sections we have explained why the
1s, 1p, 1d, 2s, . . . ordering was adopted for the calcula-
tions. The information comes from the analysis of a
single 3He atom bound to a medium-size bosonic drop,
which has been studied by density functional meth-
ods13,14 and by microscopic methods based either in vari-
ational wave functions15,17 or in DMC techniques.18 All
these studies suggest that the fermion may be viewed as a
particle bound to a potential well, centered in the bosonic
drop, but which is appreciably diﬀerent from zero (and
attractive) only in a rather wide region near the surface
of the drop, but goes to zero near the center of the drop
as well as at long distances. This single-particle potential
gives a special level ordering based on the orbital angu-
lar momentum, 1s, 1p, 1d, 1f . . . , with almost degenerate
single-particle energies. Moreover, the fermion has a very
small probability penetrating the boson drop. The same
scheme results from the study of one 3He atom in liquid
4He, giving rise to the so-called Andreev states, as well
as from the study of many 3He atoms attached to a large
core of 4He atoms.20 Note, however, that intruder lev-
els, like 2s, may appear for a suﬃciently large number of
fermions and a suﬃciently small number of bosons.

Among the possible wave functions related to a given
conﬁguration (the so-called terms in Atomic Physics) we
have chosen the two simplest cases: a) maximum total
spin on which maximum total orbital angular momen-
tum is built; b) maximum orbital angular momentum on
which maximum spin is built. The resulting wavefunc-
tions are products of two determinants, one for each spin
orientation. Other choices demand linear combination of
Slater determinants.

As the exponential tail in the trial wave function has

the role of roughly conﬁning the system, we can construct
the Slater determinants considering only the angular mo-
mentum part of the single-particle functions, as well as
the spin part. As mentioned above, we have used the har-
monic polynomials φℓm(r) = rℓYℓm(Ω) as single-particle
functions. The determinants so constructed are transla-
tionally invariant wave functions, in the sense that they
only depend on the 3NF − 3 relative coordinates ri − rj.
This fact is of crucial importance, particularly when de-
scribing systems with a small number of constituents.

The way of constructing the required determinants is
very simple. Take for instance the maximum spin case.
Once the innermost shells have been ﬁlled, the remain-
ing 3He atoms occupy the φℓℓ, φℓ ℓ−1 . . . spin up states,
until the angular momentum states are exhausted; then
the same procedure is followed to ﬁll out the spin down
states. The spin S of the resulting determinant has the
maximum value allowed for the occupancy of the shell,
and its orbital angular momentum is L = |Lz|. In general
the value of the determinant is a complex number, not
very adequate for the DMC algorithm. The solution is
as in the two-fermion case: to use the sum or diﬀerence
(whichever is non vanishing) of the determinants with
Lz = L and Lz = −L. The importance sampling wave
function has well deﬁned S, SZ and L, but not Lz. Nev-
ertheless, due to the rotational symmetry of the Hamilto-
nian, this has no inﬂuence on the energy values. However
the need of computating determinants with complex ma-
trix elements still remains, with the consequent slowing
down of the numerical calculations.

By using this procedure we have calculated states with
up to NF = 18, corresponding to the complete ﬁlling of
the three lowest shells. We have also considered states in
which all spins are up, i.e., fully polarized fermions, with
the maximum number NF = 9. The procedure to con-
struct the determinants in this case is an obvious adap-
tation of the one described above.

In previous work5,8 we used a conventional Cartesian
in particular {x2, y2, z2, xy, xz, yz}, whereby
ordering,
the single-particle orbitals are a mixture of 2s and 1d
wave functions. As a consequence the diﬀerences with
the present calculations—associated to changes in the
nodal structures—become signiﬁcant when the d−shell
starts to be ﬁlled.

B. Binding energies of normal clusters

Table IV presents the values of the binding energies
corresponding to two situations, NB = 8 and NB = 20,
for values of NF from 0 to 18. All these values have
been computed with the level ordering discussed above,
and for two possible couplings: Smax, where in each shell
particles are aligned to maximum spin S, and then to
to maximum orbital angular momentum L; Lmax, where
particles are ﬁrst aligned to maximum L, and then max-
imum S. In Table IV, whenever there are two entries for
a given cluster, the upper row corresponds to Smax, and

6

the lower one to Lmax. Maximum spin is quite uniformly
favoured but the splitting of the two computed levels is
always smaller than 0.3-0.4 K.

and 20 bosons and up to 18 fermions. Whenever there are two
entries for a given cluster, the upper row corresponds to the
Smax coupling: particles aligned to maximum S and then to

L ﬁrst and then maximum S. In the last column the results
obtained in Ref. 8 for NB = 8 are also displayed.

The present results for NF ≤ 8 should coincide, and
indeed they do, with previous calculations based in the
cartesian ordering of the single-particle states.8 Beyond
NF = 8 the calculations of Ref. 8 used an uncontrolled
mixture of 1d and 2s states, as explained above, thus cor-
responding to diﬀerent importance sampling functions.
The last column of Table IV displays the results obtained
in Ref. 8 for NB = 8 clusters. One should keep in mind
that both results are based on the DMC method within
the ﬁxed node approximation, so that in both cases the
obtained energies are actually upper bounds to the real
ones. The present binding energies for NF > 8 are
slightly higher that the previous results, the gain being
of 0.16 K for NF = 9 and monotonically increasing up
to 1.40 K for NF = 18, in the case of NB = 8. This
apparently modest increase (up to 6%) may be relevant
for the boundaries of the stability chart of mixed drops.
In any case, it gives support to the level ordering used

in the present work, as the associated importance sam-
pling function provides a better variational bound than
the previous ones.

have been plotted in Fig. 3, together with those for polar-
ized clusters [to be discussed in Section V D (Table V)].
The scale is such that values for the normal clusters are
superimposed.

Basically the energies grow linearly with the number
of fermions but ﬁner details emerge when looking at the
fermion chemical potential

µF (NF ) = E(NB, NF − 1) − E(NB, NF ),

(9)

which is plotted in Fig. 4 for two values of NB and
NF ≤ 18. Observe the sudden drop of µF after NF = 2
and 8, corresponding to the closure of the 1s and 1p
shells. The relative minimum appearing at NF = 14 is
at ﬁrst somewhat puzzling. Its origin will become clear
in Section VI.

C. The stability map revisited

As it has been mentioned in the introduction, one of
the most appealing properties of the mixed He clusters is
the existence of instability islands, namely regions around
selected values of (NB, NF ) in which the system is not
bound. These regions were discovered after Many-Body
computations based on self-adjustable variational func-
tions constructed with Jastrow factors supplemented by
2p-2h and 3p-3h Conﬁguration Interaction correlations.5
Afterwards, the calculation was reﬁned by means of the
DMC method,8 conﬁrming the previous ﬁndings. Given
that both calculations provide really with only upper
bounds to the energy, and having observed the improve-
ment of the present DMC approach, based upon a diﬀer-
ent ansatz for the determinantal part of the importance
sampling guiding wave function, we have revised the pre-
vious calculation, just to check and eventually improve
the limits of the instability regions.

Indeed, in the previous subsection we have seen that
the present level ordering leads to a noticeable energy
gain in the 1d-shell with respect to previous works. This
fact suggests that some of the clusters previously qual-
iﬁed as metastable, i.e.
systems with negative energy
but less bound than clusters with a smaller number of
fermions, could be in fact stable. Indeed, a new computa-
tion near the beginning of the 1d-shell indicates two new
bound systems, namely the clusters (NB = 3, NF = 11)
and (NB = 4, NF = 9). Special attention has been paid
to the cluster (NB = 1, NF = 18), corresponding to full
1s, 1p and 1d shells, but our ﬁnding is that this cluster
is not bound.

The stable clusters are displayed in Fig. 5, which su-
persedes the results previously obtained in Ref. 8. From
the experimental point of view, we suggest the study of
the regions NB ≤ 4 and NF ≤ 5 to ascertain the stability
limits. The measurements will require an improved mass
resolution, at least 1 amu for clusters up to 25-30 amu.

D. Polarized mixed clusters

We have also considered fully polarized mixed systems.
The values obtained for their binding energies are shown
in Table V for NB = 8 and 20. In both cases the number
of fermions NF ≤ 9 is limited by the complete ﬁlling
of the 1s, 1p and 1d orbits. The asterisk in Table V
corresponds to situations in which the binding energy of
the fully polarized system E↑(NB, NF ) is smaller than
the energy E(NB, NF − 1) of the normal cluster with one
fermion less. In the other cases the results correspond to
true bound states.

The energies of polarized clusters are compared with
those of normal clusters in Figure 3. Polarized mixed
drops are always less bound than the unpolarized cluster
with the same number of fermions. In other words, they
are excited states.

The energy diﬀerences between normal an polarized
clusters take values around 0.25 K (NB = 8) and 0.15 K
(NB = 20) per fermion. It is worth mentioning that the-
oretical calculations for liquid 3He provide a diﬀerence of
around 0.10 K per particle at the equilibrium density and
−0.10 K at densities close to the solidiﬁcation one.31 In
other words, the preferred phase would be the polarized
one at high densities. This anomalous behavior has been
interpreted as a side eﬀect related to improper nodal sur-
faces for the unpolarized systems. The particle density
of the fermionic phase in our case is much smaller than
that of the fermionic liquid, and in consequence we can-
not ascertain if our shell-model ﬁlling scheme will present
such an anomalous crossing at higher densities.

In the same ﬁgure one may appreciate a sudden change
for the diﬀerences ∆E = Enormal(NF ) − Epol(NF ) at
it corre-
NF = 4, which has a simple interpretation:
sponds to the ﬁlling of the 1p shell for the polarized case
and the related jump in the ionization potential after
adding a new fermion.

As for the unbound clusters, all of them have very high
spin, and their binding energy is larger than the energy of
the polarized cluster with one fermion less. Therefore it
is very likely that the set of polarized states corresponds
to a stable branch above the dissociation limit, analogous
to the so called displaced terms in Atomic Physics.

The separation energies for the polarized clusters, dis-
played in Fig. 6, follow basically the same pattern than
the separation energies for the normal clusters. Again

VI. EFFECTIVE MONOPOLE INTERACTION
ANALYSIS

In this section we shall treat the results of our calcula-
tions as data, and assume the validity of the shell-model
scheme to ﬁnd an eﬀective one- plus two-body Hamil-
tonian that could reproduce them. This two-body part
will only refer to fermions as the boson cluster will be
assumed as a ﬁxed core that generates the single particle
energies in Table I, leading to a one body potential

U =

nsεs

Xs

where ns is the number of particles in shell s. The sum
is extended to the occupied shells.

The two-body part is deﬁned by matrix elements

V LS
rs,tu = hrs : (LS)|V |tu : (LS)i

where |tu : (LS)i is a two-particle state in shells t and
s, coupled to orbital angular momentum L and spin S,
properly antisymmetrized and normalized.

To simplify matters, the two-body part of the full
Hamiltonian will be separated into monopole (m) and
multipole (M ) contributions H = HmS + HM . The
monopole Hamiltonian HmS is deﬁned by the property of
giving the average energy of conﬁgurations at ﬁxed num-
ber of particles nr and spin Sr. The closed shells and the
one-particle and one-hole states built on them are con-
ﬁgurations with a single state (we call this set cs ± 1).
Hence, their energies are entirely given by HmS. For the
other Slater determinants entering our calculations Hm
gives an average value that will be split by the multi-
pole term HM . We shall assume (and check) that the
inﬂuence of HM is small, and simply neglect it.

The extraction of eﬀective interaction averages goes
back in time, and an important earlier reference is the
work of French.32 The form we shall use here came later33
and was used to describe shell formation properties in nu-
clear physics.34 A forthcoming review article35 contains
comprehensive information on formal properties of Hm
and HM .

The average matrix elements are deﬁned as

Vrs =

rsrs(2L + 1)(2S + 1)(1 + (−1)L+Sδrs)

P

rs =

where Vrs is the full (scalar) average of two-body matrix
elements, whereas V S
rs are (vector) averages at ﬁxed S.

The counter-terms in the second line now ensure its van-
ishing at the closed shell as well as at one-particle and
one-hole states. As a consequence, their energies are fully
given by the ﬁrst line in Eq. (14), which we refer to as Hm
from now on. The advantage of this operation is that it
decouples the determination of the Vrs and brs centroids,
so that we can proceed with the former ﬁrst, as they are
the ones that give the global features.

In principle, the six necessary centroids—Vss, Vsp, Vsd,
Vpp, Vpd and Vdd—could be extracted from Table III.
However, this parameter-free choice has large uncertain-
ties and it is better to reserve it as a consistency check
with the results of a more precise ﬁt to the energies in Ta-
ble IV, which we call Ei, i = 0, 18. It is very instructive
to start doing the ﬁt by hand, i.e., step by step.

Upon ﬁlling, the closed shells become new “cores”:
E2 = ECs, E8 = ECp . . .. The single particle energies
are taken from Table I. Then
E2 = ECs = E0 + 2εs + Vss. Extract Vss
E3 = ECs + ǫp + 2Vsp ≡ ECs + ¯ǫp. Extract Vsp
To extract Vpp, we do not rely on E4, because it is not
purely given in terms of centroids, but on
E7 = ECs + 5¯εp + 10Vpp or
E8 = ECp = ECs + 6¯εp + 15Vpp.

The ﬁt becomes overdetermined, signalling a problem
with some basic assumption about the eﬀective interac-
tion, which we shall try to identify later. As of now let
us settle for a compromise value of Vpp. The next step is
E9 = ECp + εd + 2Vsd + 6Vpd ≡ ECp + ¯εd, that deter-
mines Vsd + 3Vpd. As the two matrix elements will only
appear in this linear combination, the number of param-
eters is reduced to ﬁve. Finally, for Vdd we have the same
compromise problem we had for Vpp. To ﬁnd reasonable
values for Vpp and Vdd it was decided to do an overall ﬁt of
the ﬁve parameters. In principle, the idea does not seem
very sound because three parameters are apparently well
determined. As we shall see, this may not be the case,
and the numerical ﬁt will turn out to be sound.

The hand-made ﬁt involves cs ± 1 states that are com-
mon to the Smax and Lmax cases in Table IV. In doing
the numerical ﬁt, only the Smax states were included.
The results for the binding energies in the NB = 8 clus-
ters are given in Fig. 7. The agreement is quite excellent,
but for the fully polarized case, also shown, there are sig-
niﬁcant discrepancies that can be cured by introducing
the full HmS through a single parameter brs = b so that
the contribution of the second line in Eq. (14) becomes
r 3nr(Dr − nr)/4(Dr − 1)]. The results
b[ S(S + 1)/2 −
of the ﬁt are given in Table VI. The ﬁtted and calcu-
lated curves become nearly undistinguishable. As noted
at the end of Section V B, the full energies are rather
smooth patterns that tell us little about details. As a
ﬁrst approximation, Fig. 7 for the normal Smax clusters
is reasonably well represented by a straight line, which
would be the analogue of the famous Bethe-Weizs¨acker
“Liquid drop” formula for nuclei. The truly sensitive
quantities are the separation energies (chemical poten-
tials) in Eq. (9) and Fig. 4. And, indeed, the true test

Fig. 10.] Therefore, the eﬀective matrix elements should
also evolve in a way our simpliﬁed HmS ignores: The nu-
merical ﬁt then emerges as the sound and natural way to
deﬁne a best compromise value, not only for Vpp and Vdd
but for all the monopole parameters.

FIG. 9: Same as Fig. 8 but for clusters with Lmax.

of the monopole description comes in Fig. 8. A smooth
linear approximation to the binding energies would result
in a constant. By introducing Hm there is an enormous
improvement in that the shell eﬀects at closures are well
reproduced (dashed line). However, the more detailed
pattern between closures demands the S(S + 1) term in
the full HmS: the agreement with DMC becomes truly
quantitative (full line).

The numerical ﬁt was made for the normal case we
have called Smax, but Table IV contains another nor-
mal mode, Lmax. As was noted, the hand-made ﬁt is
the same for both couplings, and it gives results that
are almost as good as the numerical ﬁt for Smax, and
very good ones for Lmax. But here the numerical ﬁt also
does a slightly better job, shown in Fig. 9, where HmS
is seen to reproduce beautifully the staggering pattern
between S = 0 and S = 1/2 states (referred to as Lmax
case in Table IV). Here we are faced with some inter-
esting physics: the numerical ﬁt was chosen to ﬁnd good
compromise values for Vpp and Vdd, but it does slightly
better than a ﬁt restricted to those over-determined pa-
rameters. The hint is that the other three parameters
are not as well determined as the “hand-made” ﬁt sug-
gests. The most likely reason is to be found in size ef-
fects: as fermions are added, the overall radius evolves,
and for a self-bound system it should go asymptotically
as N 1/3
F .[A strong indication in this sense will be found in

obtained with the ﬁt to the 19 normal Smax clusters with
the values obtained directly from the DMC calculation
of two-fermion states, again with a very good agreement
(within the large errors of about 0.04 K associated to the
latter), thus conﬁrming the consistency of the eﬀective
interaction interpretation.

It appears that very hard DMC calculations lead to
results amenable to a very simple and cogent interpre-
tation in terms of the monopole Hamiltonians HmS.
The S(S + 1) contribution is particularly interesting:
Fig. 7 suggests the idea that for large enough number
of fermions the polarized clusters could become ground
states. Though this is only a speculation, it may be also
be taken as a strong invitation to push the study of mixed
clusters much further.

VII. THE SHAPE OF MIXED CLUSTERS

A. Normal mixed clusters

In this section we present several ﬁgures related to the
shape of mixed clusters. In Fig. 10 there are the values
of the root mean square radii for bosons and fermions
referred to the center-or-mass of the cluster, for the se-
lected cases NB = 8 and 20. There are some ﬂuctua-
tions, probably related to the use of the mixed estimator
method to compute these radii, and thus depending on
the quality of the importance sampling wave function.
Apart from these ﬂuctuations, the most noticeable prop-
erties which emerge from these plots are the almost con-
stancy of the bosonic radii and the smooth growing of the
fermionic radii. This manifests clearly the representation
of the cluster as a quite rigid bosonic core with an halo
of fermions.

FIG. 10: The values of the root mean square radii (in ˚A) for
bosons (squares) and fermions (circles) referred to the center-
of-mass of the cluster, as a function of the number of fermions
NF in the cluster. The number of bosons are ﬁxed to NB = 8
and 20.

where label M stands for B (bosons) or F (fermions),
NM is the number of atoms of the given species, and R
is the center-of-mass of the full drop. Given that these
distributions may have an angular dependence for open
shells, we have computed the spherical average of them.
The distributions are normalized to the number of parti-
cles of a given species,

ρM (r)dr = NM .

Z

We observe in Fig. 11 that bosons are located in the
same central region, being slightly compressed as the
number of fermions increases. This shrinking is more
important for the light NB = 8 cluster, and is almost
negligible when NB = 20. With respect to the distribu-
tions of fermions, they are clearly located at the surface
of the bosonic subcluster, with a small penetration near
the center of the drop in the case of NB = 8, more im-
portant for larger values of the number of fermions. In
the case of NB = 20 the dominating picture is that of a
rigid core of bosons with a fermionic halo.

A complementary information about the shape of clus-

ters is provided by the two-body distributions,

ρM (r, r′) =

2
NM (NM − 1)

hΨ|

NM

Xi<j

δ(r − ri)δ(r′ − rj)|Ψi,

which is normalized to 1.

Because of the ﬁnite size of the system under consid-
eration, this distribution function depends on two coor-
dinates, r and r′, or, equivalently, on the distance of the
center-of-mass of the pair ((r + r′)/2) to the center-of-
mass of the system and the relative distance (r − r′) of
the two particles, thus producing a function very diﬃcult
to plot. In order to get a more friendly quantity we have
averaged the above two-body distribution with respect to
its center-of-mass and for the remaining dependence we
have computed the spherical average. The reduced pair
distribution so obtained is now normalized to 1,

ρ12(r)dr = 1.

is again hard, its radius being practically independent
of the number of spin-aligned fermions NF . Diﬀerences
with respect to the unpolarized cluster appear when com-
paring the root mean square radii of fermions, as shown
if Fig. 13 where the fermion halo in the polarized clusters
is larger than in the unpolarized case.

Something similar happens with the density distribu-
tions of bosons or fermions with respect to the center
of mass. The former remains basically unaltered when
the number of fermions grows, and the latter follows the
same pattern that in the case of unpolarized clusters.

There is, however, a remarkable fact in connection with
the two-body distributions and, speciﬁcally, the fermion-
fermion distributions. These distributions are shown in
Fig. 14, for the two selected cases N = 8 and 20. As can
be seen there, the fermion-fermion distributions are very
diﬀerent from those obtained for the normal systems: the
rise near 4 ˚A is much less pronounced and the range is
much larger, suggesting that the fermions are either less
correlated or subjected to a long-range correlation.

In order to appreciate the diﬀerences in the density
distribution functions for normal and polarized clusters,
we have plotted them in Figs. 15 for NF = 9 and NB = 8.

was motivated by the improved knowledge of the order-
ing of single-particle orbits, obtained after a systematic
study of the spectrum of a single 3He atom bound to a
core of 4He atoms,18 which is expected to provide the
optimal importance sampling trial function for the DMC
calculation. The study has concentrated on clusters hav-
ing a suﬃciently large number of 4He atoms so as to of-
fer a simpliﬁed pattern: the bosonic constituents arrange
themselves as a quite rigid core whereas the fermionic
atoms are distributed in the surface of the bosonic sub-

13

cluster, producing a halo. This arrangement, previously
obtained by means of density functional methods, has
been conﬁrmed and pushed down to systems with a small
number of constituents.

One of the primary aims was to check the previously
obtained stability map,8 after the optimization of the im-
portance sampling function, as well as the improvement
of the fermionic nodal surfaces. No signiﬁcant change
occurred, and large instability islands are still predicted
for a small (NB ≤ 3) number of 4He atoms.

The determination of correlation functions, partic-
ularly the fermion-fermion distribution functions, as
well as the analysis in terms of an eﬀective interaction
model suggests that the residual interactions between the
fermions is very weak, of the order of the computational
precision achieved (near 0.1 K). This fact is also reﬂected
in the insensitivity of the energies to the (L, S) quantum
numbers, the spectrum being essentially determined by
the conﬁguration.

In addition to the normal fermionic phase, with a small
value of the spin, we have also analyzed the possibility of
having a ferromagnetic phase, with all spins aligned. The
normal phase is energetically favored but the ferromag-
netic one gives rise to bound states, even for a moder-
ately large number of 3He atoms. For example, a cluster
with 20 bosons is able to bind up to six fermions, but
beyond that number the system is above the dissociation
limit. Nevertheless, because of the large values of the
spin for the ferromagnetic phase, one may expect these
unbound states to be long-lived, like in the case of polar-
ized liquid 3He, and thus to be experimentally detectable.
Perhaps by circulating bosonic clusters through a cold at-
mosphere of polarized 3He atoms one could create these
spin-aligned states sticking 3He atoms one-by-one to the
bosonic seed.

The mixed systems may have a very rich excitation
spectrum, because of the gap between the normal and the
polarized phase. For example, for NB = 20 and NF = 6
there is a diﬀerence of 1 K between the normal state (con-
ﬁguration 1s21p4) and the polarized state (conﬁguration
1s11p31d2). The analysis of the intermediate ﬁlled con-
ﬁgurations, such as 1s21p31d1 or 1s21p21d2 puts heavy
demands on the DMC algorithm but it would be rela-
tively simple in the density-functional method. Though
it does not seem possible with the present experimental
techniques to measure the spectrum, it is worth remem-
bering that the excitation spectrum plays a relevant role
in the production abundances of clusters.36,37

Finally one should stress the power of the eﬀective
monopole interaction analysis that points to the basic
simplicity of the DMC results and invites to take on the
challenge of unearthing the deep reasons of such simplic-
ity.

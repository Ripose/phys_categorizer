Abstract. A two-step optimization is proposed to represent an arbitrary quantum
state to a desired accuracy with the least number of gaussians in phase space. The
Husimi distribution of the quantum state provides the information to determine the
modulus of the weight for the gaussians. Then, the phase information contained in
the Wigner distribution is used to obtain the full complex weights by considering the
relative phases for pairs of gaussians, the chords. The method is exempliﬁed with
several excited states n of the harmonic and the Morse oscillators. A semiclassical
interpretation of the number of gaussians needed as a function of the quantum number
n is given. The representation can also be used to characterize Wigner and Husimi
distributions directly which do not originate in a quantum state.

Optimal representations of quantum states by gaussians in phase space

1. Introduction

In many situations there is a need to represent a given quantum state or a probability
distribution of states in terms of a simple basis which can be easily handled in further
processing, e.g.,
for integration in matrix elements. Gaussians form such a basis
although it is overcomplete. Gaussians have the additional advantage that they can
adopt the form of coherent states in phase space, thereby supplying a direct link to
classical mechanics. Hence, the formulation in terms of gaussians is also very useful
for a mixed quantum-classical or quasiclassical description of a system. In particular
the evolution of systems with many degrees of freedom can often be described within
classical molecular dynamics only. Here, one is interested in obtaining optimal initial
conditions by translating the initial quantum state of the system into a suitable classical
phase space distribution which can be classically propagated [1]. While all quantum
information on an amplitude level is lost in this approximation, we will introduce a
representation which can preserve basic quantum interferences by construction even in
the case of the purely classical propagation. Finally, it is of general and basic interest
to reconstruct amplitudes or the density matrix, i.e., coherent information, from phase
space distributions. This has been done recently in terms of the moments in time
of the Wigner distribution [2]. Although there is no principal need to do so we will
concentrate on the Wigner distribution due to the attention it has received recently in
diﬀerent areas. In several experiments the Wigner distribution of microscopic systems
has been measured [3]. Beyond the quantum context, in the time-frequency phase space
of signal processing, analysis of the Wigner distribution [4] is an important tool [4], as
for optics [5], speech analysis [6] or the monitoring of machinery conditions [7].

The decomposition of a given state

into coherent states can be regarded as a
Ψ
i
particular form of phase space representation. Labeling positions by q or Q and momenta
by p or P , we translate the ground state of the harmonic oscillator by X = (P, Q) to
obtain the coherent state in position representation, i.e. its wavefunction is [8, 11]

For simplicity, we chose unit frequency (ω = 1) and mass (m = 1) for the harmonic

used and the constant phase

are only appreciable for Xj very close to X, a nondiagonal term decays as a product of
gaussians centered on a pair of separate phase space vectors. Such a term is negligible
for all X unless Xj is very close to Xk. Moreover, such nondiagonal terms are not

The factor 1/π has here been introduced so that the left hand side becomes the Husimi
, also known as the Q-function
function [9], i.e., the Husimi representation of the state
in quantum optics [11]. Here, ρΨ is then decomposed into gaussians phase space packets
(gpps) which are Husimi representations of the coherent states, speciﬁed by (4).

Ψ

The Husimi function in its own right uniquely deﬁnes a quantum state, though
part of the quantum phase information is locked up into its delicate analytic properties.
These are hard to translate into other representations, but we propose to sidestep this
problem. Our method is to make a preliminary ﬁt of the Husimi function (8), which is
real and positive deﬁnite, and therefore much simpler than ﬁtting the complex coherent
states directly in (6). However we can now identify the coeﬃcients of the Husimi ﬁtting
as being proportional to the square modulus of the coeﬃcients of the superposition of

coherent states (6). The phases of the coeﬃcients are then determined by relating the
Husimi function to the coarse-graining of the Wigner function, i.e. we bring in yet a
. It should be pointed out that, once the
third phase space representation of the state
state
has been ﬁtted by a ﬁnite number of coherent states, it can be viewed in any
representation. The special attention given here to the Wigner function is justiﬁed by the
way that it highlights quantum interferences. In fact such interferences are sometimes
mimicked by extra gaussians in the context of numerical work with classical densities [1].
Thus, in the next section we present the Wigner function, its relation to the Husimi
function and its speciﬁc form for an arbitrary superposition of gaussians. In addition, we
discuss and establish the diﬀerences between the representation of quantum states such
as the wavefunction, the Wigner distribution and the Husimi distribution using these
gaussians. The Wigner distribution sets the stage for the delicate procedure of ﬁtting
the phases, i.e., to determine the appropriate interference fringes between the gaussians
as detailed in section 3.
In this section we propose a method for determining the
phase of the expansion coeﬃcients by Fourier analysing the Wigner function. Actually,
this resulting chord function or characteristic function (in quantum optics [10]) can
be derived directly from the initial wave function, without obtaining ﬁrst the Wigner
function. The Husimi function, on the other hand, supplies a robust overall picture of
the quantum states which can be used to place the gaussians. This will be discussed
in section 4 using explicit examples for illustration. Emphasis will be put on general
symmetry criteria for placing the gaussians and numerical demonstrations based on
Monte Carlo ﬁtting of sampled wavefunctions. Finally in section 5, we semiclassically
interpret the results of section 4, namely the increase of gaussians needed to represent
quantum states ψn of a system with increasing quantum number n. A summary in
section 6 concludes the paper.

For simplicity, all our formulae are presented for systems with a single degree of

freedom, but they are easily generalized to high dimensional systems.

Xk, as well as
the skew product (5). Comparing (15) with (7) we ﬁnd the same gaussian form for the
diagonal terms of the Wigner function as for the Husimi function, but the oﬀdiagonal
terms are no longer negligible. For the Wigner function, any pair of coherent states
determines a third gaussian centered halfway between their two centres, of comparable
amplitude to the diagonal contributions of the individual gaussians. This interference
term is only cancelled by the smoothing employed to obtain the Husimi function, because
of the phase oscillations. Their wavelengths in phase space are 2π¯h/
, so that
the Husimi function is increasingly damped with growing separation of these gpps.
This is an excellent illustration of the way that the Husimi function highlights the
classical structure in a quantum state, while it hides quantum phase information. This
question will be further developed in section 4. Of course the phase information is still
contained in the small oﬀdiagonal terms in (7), because the Husimi function is fully
quantum mechanical, but this information is certainly more accessible in the Wigner
representation.

We can now understand the diﬀerences between using the position representation,
i.e. the wave function, the Wigner representation or the Husimi representation, to ﬁt a
given state by a set of coherent states. The position representation has the advantage
that there are no interference terms between pairs of coherent states. However, if the
state is highly oscillatory, such as a highly excited eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, this

Optimal representations of quantum states by gaussians in phase space

needs to be ﬁtted by coherent states with large momenta P , which also have narrow
oscillations. Clearly the ﬁtting procedure becomes very unstable with respect to small
errors in the initial function if large momenta are necessary. In contrast, the diagonal
terms in the expansion of the Wigner function are smooth gaussians distributed over
phase space, but again we obtain increasingly narrow oscillations for the interferences
around the midpoint of each pair. Of course, the oscillations of the wave function and
the Wigner function are not unrelated, since the latter have the same wavelength as the
wave intensity in the case of a pair of gaussians located at (

P, Q).

Finally, the Husimi function washes out oscillations, the more eﬀectively the tighter
they happen to be. We shall review in section 4 how the smooth phase space distribution
singles out the basic classical structure within the quantum state, which can be stably
ﬁtted by real gpps.

The cost is that only the location of the gaussians in phase space and the square
modulus of their coeﬃcients are then determined.
In the next section we present a
method for retrieving the phases of the coeﬃcients by taking the Fourier transform of
the Wigner function.

3. Fitting the phases

Both, the direction and the wavelength of the fringes that modulate the interference
peak halfway between two gpps at Xj and Xk in the Wigner representation, are entirely
determined by δXjk. However, these fringes are translated by changing the phases of
the coeﬃcients aj and ak, which we wish to determine. Clearly, the best way to recover
these phases is to take the Fourier transform of the Wigner function:

which resembles the Wigner transform (10). This function is known as the Woodward
ambiguity function in communications theory [14] or the characteristic function in
quantum optics [10]. Usually the sign of ξp is reversed in the deﬁnition of ˜W , but
here we follow [15], where it is simply called the chord function. A justiﬁcation for this
term appears immediately if we consider the case of a superposition of gaussians that is
our concern :

Of course, the modulus of both sides of (22) should be approximately equal, which
provides a check on the previous Husimi ﬁtting. The diagonal sum that is substracted
from ˜WΨ(δXjk) in (22) decays exponentially with δX 2
jk, so it will only aﬀect the
phases of the smaller chords. It might appear to be only consistent with our previous
approximation of the Husimi function to neglect the diagonal sum in (22), but this
would perturb the phases of small chords.

4. Placing the gaussians: examples

So far, nothing has been said about how to place the gaussians in phase space that
are meant to approximate a given Husimi function. An obvious criterion is that any
relative maximum of this smooth distribution should also receive a coherent state.
Further knowledge of the state should also be used. For instance, if it is known to
be the eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian ˆH with energy En, then the semiclassical
considerations in the following section allow the restriction of the gaussian centers to
¯h. Of course, the ﬁtting procedure is only useful for cases in which ˆH is

may itself be a linear superposition of states, such as result from a

possible symmetries. For instance, for the eigenstate of an even potential, one should
aj+, so as to guarantee
place the gaussians symmetrically at (Pj,
±
even or odd states. Again, this is a very particular case, but time reversal invariance
is much more common. If the state
resulted from initial real wave functions and
the evolution proceeded through interactions that preserve time reversal symmetries (in
usual practice, if there are no magnetic ﬁelds) then the ﬁnal state can also be real. In

this case, one must choose symmetric pairs of gaussians at (

or π. Any further knowledge should generally be used to reduce the randomness of the

positions of the coherent states to be ﬁtted to
the following section may be a further guideline. When this knowledge is exhausted, the
best course is to optimize random guesses by Monte Carlo ﬁtting of arbitrary gaussians,

be minimized for a set of M grid points xl = (pl, ql). To ﬁt this superposition of gpps
as closely as possible to ρψ(x), we proceed as follows: (i) the centers xk = (pk, qk)k=1,..,N
of the coherent states are obtained by Monte-Carlo sampling the region where the
distribution is signiﬁcant; that is the region where the distribution exceeds a certain
threshold δ; (ii) the centers must not be too close, this means a minimum distance ∆
between centers is ﬁxed a priori, thereby avoiding overlaps and reducing the total number
N of gpps used for the representation; (iii) starting with N = 1 we increase N by one
and repeat the process until the desired accuracy is reached. Since only the coeﬃcients
Ak are ﬁtted, minimizing the error σ reduces to a problem of linear optimization which
is equivalent to solving the real matrix equation

special algorithms can be used to solve (26) eﬃciently [21]. In principle one may also
consider to optimize this ﬁtting with respect to the widths of the gpps; but since the
Husimi function is always smooth and positive deﬁnite, it is convenient to keep them
frozen. In what follows, we have tested our method on the ﬁtting of the eigenstates
of the harmonic oscillator (HO) and that of the Morse oscillator (MO) supporting 18

bound states [22]. We have not used the knowledge that these states have time reversal
symmetry in the way mentioned earlier, so we should obtain results of comparable
quality even for states with complex wave functions. Figure 1 shows, on the top, the
known Husimi function for the 3rd excited state of HO (left) and for the 5th excited
state of MO (right), with parameters ω = m = ¯h = 1. On the bottom the corresponding
ﬁtted distributions are shown. We found that N = 7 is suﬃcient to reproduce quite
well the Husimi function of HO whereas 14 coherent states (gpps) are needed in the
MO example, to achieve a global relative error of σ
0.01. The respective values
for the threshold δ and the minimum distance ∆ are given in the caption of ﬁgure 1.
This preliminary ﬁt on the Husimi function provides us with the total number N of
gpps, their location in phase space (pk, qk) and the expansion coeﬃcients Ak. These
coeﬃcients are related to those of the coherent states ak and their phases θk by

Up to this point, the phases θk are still unknown. We only need to determine the
phases diﬀerences θjk in (15) which can be easily extracted from (24). This says that,
for N gpps, N(N
1)/2 chords (θjk) are required to reproduce the Wigner function.
These N(N
1)/2 pairs of gaussians (chords) are symmetrically spaced about ξ = 0,
so that, being more dense, they overlap more than the original set of N gaussians in
phase space. Figure 2 shows on the top the Wigner function of the 3rd excited state of
the HO together with its corresponding ﬁt obtained with 7 gpps. The present ﬁtting
reproduces the Wigner function everywhere in phase space, even for negative regions
which are signatures of quantum interference. This is clearly illustrated in ﬁgure 3 where

the deviations of the Monte Carlo sampled Wigner function, less than 10−4 everywhere
in phase space, are depicted for both, the HO (left, n = 3) and the MO (right, n = 5).
The global relative error σ is subsequently found not to exceed 0.01. Moreover, we
have computed the number N of gpps needed to represent the Wigner functions of the
eigenstates of our test systems, as can be seen in ﬁgure 4. One sees that N grows
proportionally to √n as the vibrational quantum number n increases. In the following
section, we provide a semiclassical justiﬁcation of this result by means of the WKB
quantization.

5. Semiclassical approach

A semiclassical state
iSC is supported by a curve in phase space, in the case of one
degree of freedom, or in general by a surface with half the phase space dimension [16, 17].

If the curve or surface is closed, it must be Bohr-quantized and it will be symmetric about
p = 0 in the case of time reversal symmetry. In the case of the position representation,
for each branch of the curve (surface), pj(q), one deﬁnes the action

The amplitudes aj(q) can also be expressed in terms of the actions, but the important
point is that they are purely classical so that the only ¯h-dependence occurs in the
exponential. Thus locally, for any small range of positions, the semiclassical wave
function reduces to a superposition of plane waves characterized by the wave-vectors
pj(q)/¯h. The semiclassical Wigner function is also deﬁned in terms of an action
Sj(x)
with respect to the classical curve (surface). But instead of the area between the curve
and the q-axis, we are now concerned with the area sandwiched between the curve and
one of its chords. The latter, ξk(x), is selected by the property that it is centred on the
point x, as shown in ﬁgure 5. Thus, for one degree of freedom [18],

but now these are phase space waves. Comparison of this expression with (22)
immediately reveals that these waves have exactly the same wave vector as a pair
of gaussians at the tip of each chord ξk(x).
It follows that an important feature of
a semiclassical state is automatically reproduced by ﬁtting it with gaussians precisely
placed on the corresponding classical curve (surface). Notice that, in fact, this is a major
a priori obstacle to performing the ﬁtting, because the oscillations near the midpoint
of a long chord are very ﬁne for ¯h <<
Sk. One would need very narrow gaussians
indeed to ﬁt these phase space waves directly, rather than having them arise naturally
π/4. How can we
as interferences. All that is left to determine the phase:
single out the region in which to place the gpps, if we have no a priori knowledge of the
classical structures correponding to a quantum state? The obvious course is to smooth
the Wigner function with a Gaussian window. In other words, we initially ﬁt the Husimi
function. Recalling that the gpps have linear width of order √¯h, while the wavelength of
the Wigner oscillations are ¯h/
, it follows that this gaussian window erases eﬀectively

a semiclassical Wigner function, except in the limit of very small chords. This is a simple
explanation of the well known fact that only in the neighbourhood of the classical curve
(surface) itself is the semiclassical Husimi function appreciable. In the simple case of
one degree of freedom, the Husimi function is concentrated near the energy shell. Thus,
by ﬁtting gpps to a Husimi function, one automatically samples its relevant classical
mainifold, if it happens to have a (possibly unknown) semiclassical structure. A basic
assumption in the above argument is that the gpps along the curve (surface) are neither
too crowded, to avoid confusing superpositions, nor too sparsely spaced, lest gaps should
arise in the ﬁtting. It is thus easy to estimate the growth of the number of coherent
states required to ﬁt the eigenstate
with the degree of excitation. Since the linear
width of the gaussian scales as √¯h, the phase space area of the curve grows as n¯h and
hence its length grows as √n¯h, the number of equispaced gaussians needed to cover
the curve grows as √n. Of course, we have assumed here that the shape of the curve
does not change with n, as for the harmonic oscillator. If the eigencurve elongates for
higher excitation, the number of gpps necessary for a good ﬁt will grow as nα, with
1/2
1. We can also estimate the growth in time of the number of gpps required
to ﬁt an evolving semiclassical state with arbitrary precision. According to the theory
of van Vleck [16], it is suﬃcient to evolve the curve (surface) classically and then to
reconstruct the wave function. This principle can also be applied to Wigner functions,
according to Berry and Balazs [20].
If the driving Hamiltonian is chaotic, then the
curve will stretch at a rate depending on the Lyapunov exponent, λ. Clearly, this also
determines the initial rate of growth of the number of gpps needed for an adequate ﬁt.
Ultimately, when the curve covers densely all the available phase space (the energy shell
of the driving Hamiltonian), a steady state will be reached where the number of gpps
saturates.

6. Conclusions

Optimal ﬁtting of quantum states by phase space gaussians is achieved by ﬁrst ﬁtting
the Husimi function and then determining the quantum phases from the chord function,
It is clear from the discussion in
i.e. the Fourier transform of the Wigner function.
the introduction that the density of gaussians in phase space must be ﬁnely adjusted:
If ther are too few, essential features of the state will be missed, whereas an excessive
number of gaussians would introduce interference terms in the Husimi function itself,
which could only be accomodated by a much more complex variation of this method.
The numerical examples in section 4 indicate clearly that , as well as achieving excellent
overall accuracy, all essential qualitative features of the states are captured by this
method, using a basis of gaussians that grows more slowly than the excitation number
of the ﬁtted states. This last result and further insight into the ﬁtting procedure, follows
from the semiclassical analysis in the previous section. This can be generalized readily
to states of quantum systems with higher degrees of freedom if these are eigenstates
if they are supported by a Lagrangean surface in phase
of integrable systems (i. e.

space; see e. g.
[17]). Of course, more gaussians will then be needed for the ﬁtting,
but the preliminary ﬁt of the Husimi function should still provide optimal results. The
potential for this method to deal with the eigenstates of chaotic systems is even more
interesting. Though the chord and centre description of the Wigner function still applies
to mixtures of eigenstates over narrow energy windows, no classical theory accounts for
individual eigenstates at present. Therefore, it will be extremely useful to describe
these as interfering superpositions of gaussians placed near the energy shell. Of course,
the size of this basis would diverge at the classical limit as ¯h
0, but manageable
approximations should be attainable for ﬁnite excitations.

The experimentally determined size-evolutionary pat-
terns (SEPs) of simple metal clusters pertaining to ion-
ization potentials (IPs), electron aﬃnities, and monomer
separation energies have attracted much attention in the
past ten years1,2, since they may reﬂect the electronic
shell structure of clusters (the major features of SEPs
are associated with steps at magic numbers, but often
there is in addition substantial ﬁne structure, such as
odd-even alternations).

Due to the required computational eﬀort, ﬁrst-
principles (FP) theoretical studies (which incorporate the
ionic geometry) of such SEPs are usually limited to clus-
ter sizes of the order of ten atoms.3,4 Recently, however,
systematic theoretical investigations of such SEPs have
been performed for a broad range of cluster sizes us-
ing the jellium-related Shell-Correction-Method (SCM)
approach.5–8

In a recent article, Gardet et al.9 have studied the
lithium clusters LiN (with N ≤ 12)
IPs of small
using a FP - density functional theory (DFT) and
found reasonable agreement between theory and exper-
iment. Furthermore, through a comparison of their re-
sults with those obtained from Kohn-Sham local-density-
approximation (KS-LDA) calculations on a spherical jel-
lium background,10,11 they concluded that the jellium
model is inadequate for a proper description of the IPs
of such systems.

The purpose of this comment is to clarify that, while
modelling the ions in a cluster via a uniform jellium back-
ground is certainly an approximation, the above conclu-
sion of Gardet et al. pertains to limitations introduced
through neglect of deviations from spherical symmetry,
rather than to the jellium approximation itself. Indeed,
in a series of papers,6–8 we have demonstrated that con-
sideration of triaxial shape deformations drastically im-
proves the agreement between the jellium approximation
and experiment for all instances of the aforementioned
SEPs and for sizes up to 100 atoms, as well as for a vari-
ety of metal species (namely, alkali metals, such and Na
and K, and noble metals, such as Cu and Ag).

To further elucidate the importance of shape deforma-
tions, we display in Fig. 1 the IPs of small LiN clusters (in
the same size-range as with Ref. 9) calculated12 with our
SCM for three diﬀerent families of shapes of the jellium
background [namely, spherical, spheroidal (axially sym-
metric), and ellipsoidal (triaxial)], and compare them to
the experimental measurements.13

Fig. 1 reveals that spherical shapes (top panel) ex-
hibit a characteristic sawtoothed proﬁle, well known from

previous spherical KS-LDA studies10 and similar to the
curve14 labeled jellium-LDA in Fig. 12 of Ref. 9. Apart
from major-shell closures, this sawtoothed proﬁle de-
scribes the data rather poorly (notice in particular the
absence of ﬁne structure between major shell closures at
N = 2, 8 and 20).

The spheroidal model (middle panel) exhibits substan-
tial improvement in describing the experimental trend.
Furthermore, the ellipsoidal case (bottom panel) im-
proves the agreement between the SCM results and ex-
periment even further, in particular in the size range
11 ≤ N ≤ 14. The essential improvement introduced
by the deformations over the spherical case concerns the
very good description of the subshell closure at N = 14
and of odd-even alternations between major shell clo-
sures.

In summary, we have illustrated once again that,
within the jellium approximation, deformed cluster
shapes provide an adequate description of the observed
systematic size dependence of the properties of simple
metal clusters and should necessarily be employed in
comparisons with other theoretical approaches.

12 In the case of LiN clusters, the parameters entering in
the SCM calculation are U0 = −0.035, rs = 3.25 a.u.,
t = 2.22 a.u., δ0 = δ2 = 0, W = 2.31 eV, αv = −7.985
eV, αs = 0.629 eV, and αc = 0.125 eV (see Ref. 6 for their
meaning). The liquid-drop parameters αv, αs, and αc were
speciﬁed through a ﬁt to extended-Thomas-Fermi total en-
ergy calculations for spherical clusters in conjunction with a
stabilized-jellium-LDA energy functional [see J.P. Perdew,
H.Q. Tran, and E.D. Smith, Phys. Rev. B 42, 11 627 (1990)
and C. Yannouleas and U. Landman, Chem. Phys. Lett.
217, 175 (1994)]. The need to use the stabilized-jellium-
LDA energy functional arises from the fact that the usual
jellium-LDA fails to describe the surface energy of metals
with high densities (like the case of Li). The mass of the
delocalized valence electrons was taken equal to the free-
electron mass.

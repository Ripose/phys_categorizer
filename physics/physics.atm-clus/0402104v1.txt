Abstract

We present all-electron density functional study of the geometry, electronic struc-
ture, vibrational modes, polarizabilities as well as the infrared and Raman spectra
of fullerene-like arsenic cages. The stability of Asn cages for sizes 4, 8, 20, 28, 32,
36, and 60 wherein each As atom is three-fold coordinated is examined. We ﬁnd
that all the cages studied are vibrationally stable and while all the clusters are en-
ergetically stable with respect to isolated arsenic atoms, only As20 is energetically
stable against dissociation into As4. We suggest that the Raman spectra might be
a means for observing the As20 molecule in gas phase.

Highly symmetric molecular cages are of great interest due to their inherent
symmetry and bonding[1]. The highly studied carbon fullerenes [2,3,4] are
prime examples of this class of materials. Apart from their symmetry they
also show unusual properties such as superconductivity in the solid phase [5]
and storage capacity which can have potential applications in nanotechnology.
For more than a decade considerable eﬀort has been paid to the possibility
of creating fullerene-like structures with elements other than carbon. Some
studies have shown Si and Ge clusters in the gas phase [6,7,8,9,10] form cages
but their structures are still controversial. Recently Moses and coworker [11]
have successfully synthesized a highly symmetric onion-like cage formed by
an icosahedral As@Ni12 cluster with an As atom at the center. The resulting

13-atom cluster is further encapsulated by a dodecahedral fullerene-like As20
. This report opens up the possibility of formation of other possible cage-like
Asn clusters in the laboratory. In the present study, we examine the possibility
for obtaining stable As cages for sizes upto sixty atoms.

The clusters of other isoelectronic elements nitrogen and phosphorus are well
studied. Nitrogen clusters are studied primarily because of their high energy
density. It may be pointed out that although small N clusters are stable,
the higher size clusters tend to break up into smaller clusters. Owens [12] has
studied N4, N8,N10, N12 and N20 clusters theoretically using density functional
theory (DFT). He has shown that all the nitrogen clusters have high-energy
density and will decompose into N2 releasing a large amount of energy with
highest release for N8. A number of phosphorus clusters with closed-shell struc-
ture are proposed to be more energetic than P4 [13,14,15,16] theoretically.
While the N20 clusters are highly unstable, the P20 clusters are found to have
higher stability. The prediction for P20 and the experimental existence of the
As@Ni12@As20 are indicative of the possible existence of large As clusters.

The stability of the Asn clusters were theoretically studied by Shen and Schae-
fer for sizes 2, 4, 12, and 20 [17]. However, they concluded that As20 would be
energetically competitive with ﬁve As4 clusters. Our recent calculations done
on As@Ni12@As20 and As20 indicates that As20 is stable both electronically
and vibrationally. Its most favored dissociation channel is the As tetramer
as predicted by Shen and Schaefer [17]. In this work we report our study of
other possible As cages and their electronic and vibrational stability. It is pos-
sible that the ground state structure of the As clusters considered here may
not conform to a cage-like structure. However, we have restricted our study
only to cage structures and also to the ones which may break up into integral
number of tetramers. The focus is on ﬁnding vibrationally stable symmetric
cages and the energy of dissociation into tetramers. Also we have restricted
the cage structures in which the As atoms are in 3-fold coordination as seen in
the experimentally obtained As shell of the [As@Ni12@As20]−3 cluster. In this
case, the As atoms are sp3 hybridized with a lone pair and 3 half-ﬁlled orbitals
which form σ bonds with its nearest neighbors. Shen and Schaefer have shown
that the tetrahedral As4 is a very stable cluster. This follows directly from the
considerations that As atoms are sp3 hybridized and prefer 3-fold coordination
with lone pairs. A similar feature was also seen in As@Ni12@As20 cluster [18].
Moreover, the twenty valence electrons associated with the As4 molecule is
known to correspond to a magic number in metallic clusters and this aspect
may further contribute to the stability of the tetramer [19].

Our density functional theory [20,21] based calculations were performed at
the all-electron level within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
[22] to describe the exchange-correlation eﬀects. The calculations have been
performed using the NRLMOL package [23,24,25] which employs a Gaussian

basis set where the exponentials are optimized for each atom [26]. The ba-
sis for the As contains 7s, 6p, and 4d type contracted Gaussians along with
a d-type polarization function. The package also employs a variational mesh
to calculate the integrals accurately and also eﬃciently. The Hartree poten-
tial is calculated analytically. The self-consistency cycle was carried out till
the energies converged to 1.0 × 10−6 Hartree. The symmetry restricted ge-
ometry optimization was carried out using the LBFGS scheme till the forces
were smaller than 0.001 a.u.. The vibrational frequencies are calculated by
introducing small perturbation to the equilibrium geometry in the Cartesian
directions for all atoms and calculating forces. From these, the dynamical ma-
trix is calculated by ﬁnite diﬀerence method, diagonalization of which yields
the frequencies [27].

We present the optimized structures of the As4,8,20,28,32,36,60 fullerene-like cages
in Figs. 1 and 2. The range of nearest neighbor As-As bond lengths, the bond
angles, and the symmetry of the molecules are listed in Table 1. The bond
lengths of the cages lie between 2.43 to 2.74 ˚A. The As-As bond length in the
experimentally observed As@Ni12@As20 cluster is 2.75 ˚Awhich is close to the
largest bond-length seen in the As cages. The bond angles for the smallest
cluster is 60o which increases to the range 104-130o for the larger cages. The
As4 and As8 clusters have Td and Oh point symmetry. The bond lengths and
angles do not vary in these structures due to their symmetry. The As20 has a
dodecahedron structure made up of 12 pentagons. The 28-atom cluster also has
Td symmetry and has three inequivalent atoms. The 32-atom cluster has an

unusual cage-like structure which has an elongated structure. The symmetry
for the As32 cluster allows for cyclic permutations plus non cyclic permutations
followed by inversion. The As36 has D6h symmetry while the 60-atom cluster
has a structure similar to the C60 structure. However, the As60 cluster is much
larger than the C60 in size. Apart from the As32, all the clusters from n=20
onward are spherical in shape. While As20 is made up of pentagons, the 28-,
32-, 36-, 60-atom clusters have both pentagonal and hexagonal faces. From
the Table 1, it becomes evident that beyond As20, the bonds of the clusters
are not of equal length and some the bonds become stretched in the larger
clusters.

The energetics of the clusters are shown in Table 2. The atomization energy,
gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals
(HOMO-LUMO), and the energies of dissociation into As4 are presented in Ta-
ble 2. The binding energies per atom of the As clusters are centered around 2.7
eV. All the clusters considered here have close shell structures with a relatively
large HOMO-LUMO gap and are Jahn-Teller stable. We have also conﬁrmed
that all the clusters studied are local minima in the potential energy land-
scape. The most striking aspect of these clusters is their dissociation energies
with respect to As4. Although the atomization energies and vibrational fre-
quencies indicate the clusters to be stable, apart from the As20 cluster, all the
other cages are unstable with respect to As4. It may be pointed out that Shen
and Schaefer have predicted that As20 to be competitive with As4 clusters.
On the other hand, the experimental mass spectrum of the As@Ni12@As20
clusters show peaks for all AsxNi12 clusters where x=1,21 indicating that in
this cluster the dissociation channel is As monomers rather than tetramers.
This was shown due to the unusual change in bonding of the As20 in the en-
capsulated form [18]. The stability of the As20 cage compared to all the other
cage structures is still surprising.

The binding energy of the As20 is slightly higher than the As4 cluster. The
As4 clusters are highly unreactive as evident from the large HOMO-LUMO
is larger than other clusters while the
gap. The atomization energy for As4
HOMO-LUMO gap of As4
is large which indicates the special structural
and chemical stability of the As4 . The As20 is characterized by even larger
atomization energy which indicates its stability with respect to As4 . The
dissociation energy for the tetramer channel for all the other clusters are large
and positive. The instability of the clusters increases towards the larger sizes.
One possible explanation can be the stretching of the bond-angle in the larger
clusters. As can be seen from the Table 1, the bond angles in the larger clusters
of size n=28 onward are twice as large as those in the tetramer.

The dissociation of all the As cages except As20 is exothermic with respect
to As4 units and the energy released lies between 1 to 11 eV. This is by no
means large as in the case of nitrogen cages [12] which dissociates into N2
units. Although N and As occur in the same group, N2 is more stable due
to the formation of triple bond than the As4. It may be mentioned here that
dissociation of nitrogen cages of size 4 to 20 are found to release energy of the
order of 3.0 to 3.8 Kcal/gm [12].

The predicted infrared(IR) and Raman spectra are presented in Figs. 3, 4, and
5. These spectra may help in experimental characterization of such cages. The
As4 , As8 and As20 show only one IR active mode each at 257 cm−1 , 227 and
167 cm−1 . The larger cages have more dispersion in their bond-lengths and
hence in the spring constant resulting in more IR active modes. One noticeable
feature is that for the more symmetric cages the IR active frequency goes down

are much diminished for the higher size clusters.

The Raman spectra of the As cages are plotted in the frequency ranges of
0 - 120 cm−1 and 120 - 400 cm−1 in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. The larger
clusters show high peaks in the low frequency region which are several order
of magnitude larger than that of the As4 cluster. The Raman active modes

to the other clusters and therefore is plotted in a diﬀerent scale.

are the ones which change the polarizability of the cages. The frequency of the
highest Raman peak decreases as the number of atoms and the radius of the
cage increases. The polarizability of the As60 is 43.4 per bohr3 per atom and
its radius is 6.27 ˚A. Due to the larger radii of the higher order clusters, the
polarizability and its derivative increases which in turn inﬂuences the Raman
intensity. This trend is seen across the series. The polarizabilities and the
average radii of the clusters are shown in Table 3. Since the polarizability is
proportional to the volume R3, the larger clusters have higher polarizabilities.
A comparison with C60 fullerene shows [28] that in the As60 the polarizability
is about 4-5 times larger. This is consistent with the radii of the two cages
- the As60 cage is about 2 times larger than the C60 cage. The As60 shows
an intense Raman peak at 24cm−1 corresponding to a Hg mode of vibration
which is several times larger than those for As28, As32, and As36. Unlike the
IR spectra, the intensity of the highest peaks gets larger as the cluster size
grows. For a plane polarized incident light and under the condition that the
direction of incident beam, the polarization direction of the incident light
and the direction of observation are perpendicular to each other, the Raman
scattering cross-section is given by the following equation [29] :

respectively of A1, T2 and E symmetry. The highest peak for As4 occurs at
344 cm−1 in good agreement with experimental value of 356 cm−1 [30]. The
experimental Raman spectra of As vapor shows a strong peak at this frequency
[30]. The As4 shows other peaks at 201 and 256 cm−1 . The experimental
spectrum displays a broad peak at around 250 cm−1 which becomes much
broader at high temperature. A weighted Raman spectra of the most stable
species, namely As4 and As20 shows an asymmetric peak around 250 cm−1
similar to the experimental proﬁle. Another peak at 200 cm−1 is less intense
but is still visible in the experimental spectrum. The calculated As20 Raman
spectrum shows prominent peaks at frequencies 185, 151, and 79 cm−1 . Since
the experimental Raman spectrum is measured between 120 to 450 cm−1 ,
the large signatures of the As20 can not be discerned from the experimental
spectrum. In the high density limit, the peaks of the weighted spectrum shows
small peaks at 150 and 79 cm−1 whereas around 250 a somewhat broad peak
is observed. In the low density limit, the peaks below 150 becomes much more
prominent than the peaks at higher frequencies. An experimental measurement
of the Raman spectra in the low frequency region can be helpful in identifying
the existence of As20.

In conclusion, we have studied the geometry, vibrational stability, energetics
and IR and Raman spectra of As cages of size n = 4, 8, 20, 28, 32, 36, and
60 to examine the possibility of existence of As cages. We ﬁnd that all the
clusters except As20 are unstable against dissociation into As4 units. The en-
ergy released in the exothermic dissociation is signiﬁcantly smaller then that
associated with the isoelectronic nitrogen clusters. We determine the vibra-
tional stability of the clusters and also predict the IR and Raman spectra.
The polarizability increases with cluster size. We expect our study will inspire
experimental search for such metastable clusters and suggest that the Raman
peak at roughly 80 cm−1 could be used to identify the existence of As20.

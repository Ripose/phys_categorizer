OCS in small para-hydrogen clusters: energetics and structure with N=1-8 complexed
hydrogen molecules

We determine the structure and energetics of complexes of the linear OCS molecule with small
numbers of para-hydrogen molecules, N =1-8, using zero temperature quantum Monte Carlo meth-
ods. Ground state calculations are carried out with importance-sampled rigid body diﬀusion Monte
Carlo (IS-RBDMC) and excited state calculations with the projection operator imaginary time spec-
tral evolution (POITSE) methodology. The ground states are found to be highly structured, with a
gradual build up of two axial rings as N increases to 8. Analysis of the azimuthal density correla-
tions around the OCS molecule shows that these rings are quite delocalized for small N values, but
become strongly localized for N ≥ 5 . Excited state calculations are made for a range of total cluster
angular momentum values and the rotational energy levels ﬁtted to obtain eﬀective rotational and
distortion constants of the complexed OCS molecule as a function of cluster size N . Detailed anal-
ysis of these spectroscopic constants indicates that the complexes of OCS with para-hydrogen have
an unusually rich variation in dynamical behavior, with sizes N =1-2 showing near rigid behavior,
sizes N =3-4 showing extremely ﬂoppy behavior, and the larger sizes N =5-8 showing more rigid
behavior again. The large values of the distortion constant D obtained for N =3-4 are rationalized
in terms of the coupling between the OCS rotations and the ”breathing” mode of the ﬁrst, partially
ﬁlled ring of para-hydrogen molecules.

I. INTRODUCTION

Complexes of small molecules with variable number of para-hydrogen (p-H2) molecules pose a challenging and
fascinating arena for the manifestation of nuclear quantum eﬀects on structure and spectroscopy. Like their better
known analogous helium clusters, para-hydrogen clusters are expected to be strongly inﬂuenced by the quantum
nature of the p-H2 molecules. The mass of p-H2 being one half that of 4He actually suggests that larger zero point
eﬀects might be expected. However, the greater binding of p-H2 to itself and to other species means that the greater
delocalization tendency of p-H2 competes with greater localizing potential energy terms. The competition between
these two strong eﬀects is what causes both calculation and analysis of para-hydrogen clusters and complexes to
be considerably more diﬃcult than that for analogous helium systems. Like helium, para-hydrogen is a boson, but
because of the greater binding energy, p-H2 solidiﬁes in the bulk before cooling to a low enough temperature for
macroscopic manifestation of the boson permutation exchange symmetry to occur with a superﬂuid phase. However,
in ﬁnite clusters vestiges of superﬂuidity may occur, particularly when the para-hydrogen packing is expanded or
otherwise constrained by the reduced dimensionality and/or the p-H2 molecules are bound to foreign species.

The linear OCS molecule has played a key role in developing our understanding of the fundamental forces controlling
the properties of p-H2 complexes. Experimental studies with OCS complexed by variable numbers of para-hydrogen
(N ≤ 16) and embedded in helium droplets have shown a very rich spectroscopic behavior, with both vibrational shifts
and rotational ﬁne structure providing indirect information on the symmetry and distribution of the p-H2 around the
OCS molecule [1–3]. In helium, the rotational spectra of the para-hydrogen complexes are well ﬁt by asymmetric
tops for N =1-4, while larger clusters appear adequately described by a symmetric top Hamiltonian [2]. For certain
sizes, N =5, 6, 11, 14-16, no Q-branch is seen in the spectra. For the larger sizes, N =14-16, this disappearance is
temperature dependent, which led to the suggestion that it might be a manifestation of superﬂuidity in the para-
hydrogen component. Path integral Monte Carlo calculations for a complete solvation shell (N =17) have shown that
a transition to an anisotropic superﬂuid state is indeed found at temperatures below T= 0.3 K, and that this can
account for the disappearance of the Q-branch for N ≥ 11 [4]. However, for the smaller sizes, the spectral anomaly
is independent of temperature. In the absence of detailed knowledge of the structure and rigidity of the complex, the
microscopic origin of this anomaly is less clear, although the permutation symmetry can also be expected to play a
role.

Much less is known experimentally about the complexes of OCS with para-hydrogen in the absence of a solvating
helium environment. The OCS(p-H2) dimes has been characterized by high resolution spectroscopy [5], and its
strcuture has been shown to be approximate with that of an asymmetric top rotor. The structure of this dimer is
very similar in the gas phase and in a helium droplet [6,7]. For complexes with larger numbers of para-hydrogen
molecules, no spectroscopic data have been published. We expect that OCS complexed by 1 < N < 17 para-hydrogen
molecules will show a very rich variation in structure, energetics, and spectroscopic properties, as a consequence of the

1

strongly modulated solvating hydrogen density along the axis of the OCS molecule seen in path integral calculations
for N =17 [4]. These modulations are considerably stronger than those found in the analogous complexes of OCS
with helium [8–10] because of the stronger (p-H2)-OCS and (p-H2)-(p-H2) interactions. Consequently we can expect
a considerably more complex size dependence of the spectroscopic properties for the complexes with p-H2 as the ﬁrst
solvation shell is ﬁlled. The small complexes of OCS with helium have recently been shown to undergo a transition
from near rigid molecular complex behavior to true quantum (or ”superﬂuid”) solvation characterized by permutation
exchanges along the molecular axis, as the number of helium atoms increases from N =1 to N =20 [10]. Given the recent
demonstration of anisotropic superﬂuidity in OCS(p-H2)17 [4], we expect an analogous transition for complexes with
molecular hydrogen. However, the considerably greater competition between quantum (kinetic) delocalization and
(potential) localization for para-hydrogen renders even qualitative prediction of the spectroscopic behavior impossible
without detailed microscopic calculations. Furthermore, for the intermediate sizes 1 < N < 17, the properties of gas
phase OCS(p-H2)17 complexes and their analogous embedded in helium droplets can be expected to show maximal
diﬀerences, since this is the size regime in which subtle changes in para-hydrogen and helium density distributions
can give rise to signiﬁcant energy diﬀerences.

In this paper we present results of ground and excited state calculations for OCS complexed with N =1-8 para-
hydrogen molecules, as part of a larger systematic study of the complexes with up to a complete solvation shell [11].
We employ two kinds of zero temperature quantum Monte Carlo methods, the diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and the
projection operator imaginary time spectral evolution (POITSE) approach. These microscopic calculations provide
energy levels and rotational and distortion constants, in addition to energetics and ground state structures. We ﬁnd
a very interesting variation in structure for this series of small complexes, showing considerably more inhomogeneous
behavior than the analogous series of complexes of OCS with 4He. We determine the structure both along the
molecular axis and around it, with analysis of para-hydrogen pair correlation functions and ﬁnd that this allows us to
provide a good description of the extent of localization in the ground state. The excited state energies are extracted
from a maximum entropy analysis of the imaginary time correlation functions derived from the POITSE approach.
We ﬁnd that a simple multi-exponential ﬁt of these correlations functions provides similar results, but with larger
uncertainties. Analysis of the ﬁtted spectral constants resulting from the excited state energies reveals a gradual
change of symmetry of the OCS(p-H2)N complexes as N increases, which is accompanied by a monotonic decrease in
the eﬀective rotational constant over this size range. While overall the analysis of spectral constants indicates more
rigid structures for these OCS complexes with para-hydrogen than those with helium, the ﬁtted spectral constants
nevertheless show a markedly strong appearance of ﬂoppy, non-rigid structures for both the N =3 and N =4 complexes.
We discuss these structures and predicted spectroscopic constants in relation to available experimental data and in
the context of the analogous OCS(4He)N complexes [10].

II. THEORETICAL APPROACH

A. Interaction Potentials

The total interaction potential for the OCS(p-H2)N clusters is obtained as a sum of all pairwise contributions,
neglecting the eﬀects of three-body forces among the para-hydrogen molecules, while correctly treating the many-
body interaction between the linear OCS impurity molecule and each p-H2 molecule one at a time. Because of its
nuclear spin symmetry (I=0), para-hydrogen can only access even values of its angular momentum, i.e., jH =0, 2, 4,
etc. Furthermore, given the large spacing between the rotational levels, jH can generally be assumed to be a good
quantum number in the weakly bound van der Waals complexes [12,13,5]. These considerations, together with the
fact that our calculations are carried out at a temperature of 0 K, allow us to consider each p-H2 molecule as being in
its jH =0 rotational state. Therefore, in the present study, we treat the para-hydrogen molecules as spherical particles.

The total interaction potential can then be expressed as

V (R) =

V OCS−(p−H2)(Ri, ϑi) +

V (p−H2)−(p−H2)(Rij )

(1)

N

Xi=1

Xi<j

where R is a generic vector that deﬁnes the coordinates of all the particles. Therefore, Rij is the distance between
p-H2 molecules i and j, and Ri, ϑi are the Jacobi coordinates of the ith para-hydrogen molecule in the center of mass
frame of the OCS (see Fig. 1).

For the (p-H2)-(p-H2) interaction we use the spherical part of the empirical potential proposed by Buck et al. [14].
The OCS-(p-H2) interaction is obtained after integration over the p-H2 angular variables (ϑ′, φ′) of a 4-dimensional
ab initio potential energy surface recently calculated by Higgins et al. using fourth-order M¨oller-Plesset perturbation

2

theory [15]. A contour plot of the averaged potential is shown in Fig. 2a. The global minimum of -144.5 cm−1 is
located at R = 3.35 ˚A and ϑ = 105◦. Two other local minima corresponding to the two collinear geometries are also
found. The ﬁrst, at ϑ = 0◦ and R = 4.52 ˚A has a well depth of -91.4 cm−1. The second, with a well depth of -69.2
cm−1 is located at ϑ = 180◦ and R = 4.92 ˚A. In Fig. 2b we show the minimum potential energy angular path, from
which we see that a saddle point of -66.49 cm−1 is located at ϑ = 53.5◦ and R = 4.29 ˚A.

B. Ground state calculations

1. Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method

The ground state energies for the OCS(p-H2)N clusters are ﬁrst calculated using the VMC method. In this stochastic
approach, one constructs a trial wavefunction ΨT (R; {p}) which approximates the exact ground state wavefunction
of the system, Φ0(R), for a given Hamiltonian ˆH. Here, {p} denotes a set of adjustable parameters that control the
shape of the trial wavefunction. The energy expectation value is then evaluated using a Monte Carlo integration. In
most cases, ΨT (R; {p}) 6= Φ0(R), and, consequently, the VMC method provides an upper bound for the total energy,

The last equation can be rewritten in a convenient form for Monte Carlo integration as

E0 ≤ E({p}) = R

where n is the total number of conﬁgurations that are sampled from the probability density function | ΨT (R; {p}) |2
using the Metropolis algorithm [16]. In eq. (4) EL(Rk; {p}) is the local energy

In our implementation ΨT (R; {p}) is given by the usual generalized product form

EL(Rk; {p}) = Ψ−1

T (R; {p}) ˆHΨT (R; {p}).

where Ri, ϑi and Rij are the same as in eq. (1). This type of trial function is symmetric with respect to p-H2 molecule
exchanges and thus explicitly includes Bose statistics.

For the (p-H2)-(p-H2) correlation, we used the two-parameter function

ξT (Rij ) = exp (−

− p′

2Rij ).

For the (p-H2)-OCS correlation, we started from an analytic ﬁt to the ground state wavefunction of the N =1 (p-H2)-
OCS complex calculated by use of the collocation method [17]. This function has the form

χT (Ri, ϑi) = exp {p1rp2 + p3[p9 + p4(cos γ − p8)2] ln r + [p5r2(cos γ − p8)2 − p10]ep6−p7r}

where r =

y2 + z2, y = Ri sin ϑi − p12, z = Ri cos ϑi − p11 and cos γ = z/r.

p

Optimization of the parameters {p} for N >1 is then performed by simultaneous minimization of the energy E({p})
and its variance. This approach provides the best wavefunction ΨT (R; {p}) given a particular functional form [18].
The values of the optimized parameters are reported in Table I.

In the present study, a VMC run typically consists of 5×106 steps whose size is uniformly distributed and chosen

such that the number of accepted moves is approximately mantained at half the number of the attempted ones.

2. Diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method

Exact calculations of the ground state properties for a many-body quantum system can be made by use of the DMC
method [19]. We employ here the rigid-body diﬀusion Monte Carlo (RB-DMC) scheme that is described in ref. [20].
In the following we provide only a summary of the main concepts and give details speciﬁc to the OCS(p-H2)N system.
Within the RB-DMC formulation we treat the OCS molecule as a rigid-rotor interacting with N spherical p-H2

molecules. The imaginary time (τ = it/¯h) Schr¨odinger equation can then be written as:

∂Φ(R, τ )
∂τ

= −[ ˆH − Eref ]Φ(R, τ )

where Eref is the reference energy deﬁning the zero of the absolute energy scale, and ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the
system

In the r.h.s. of eq. (10) the ﬁrst two terms are the translational and the rotational kinetic energy of the OCS molecule,
respectively. M0 is the mass of the OCS and B0 its rotational constant. φx, φy describe the OCS rotations about the
x- and y-axis in the molecule-ﬁxed frame, where the z-axis is taken to lie along the OCS axis. The term − ¯h2
i is
the kinetic energy of the ith p-H2 molecule and m is the p-H2 mass. Finally, V (R) is the total interaction potential
of eq. (1).

2m ∇2

It is well known that eﬃciency of the DMC method can be improved if one introduces a guiding function ΨT (R). For
our OCS(p-H2)N system this leads to the importance-sampled RB-DMC equation for the product function f (R, τ ) =
Φ(R, τ )ΨT (R), which diﬀers from eq. (9) by the presence of additional drift terms:

The last three equations deﬁne the quantum forces that direct the sampling of f (R, τ ) into regions where ΨT (R) is
large.

The steady state solution f (R, τ → ∞) = Φ0(R)ΨT (R) of eq. (11) is obtained by use of a random walk technique.
An ensemble of walkers {Xk} with associated statistical weights {wk} is propagated in imaginary time from an initial
arbitrary distribution using the short time approximation of the Green’s function appropriate to eq. (11) [20]. Here,
X is a vector in a (3N +5)-dimensional space. Two of these dimensions describe the OCS rotational motion and the
remainder 3(N +1) the translational motion of all the particles. The propagation from τ to τ + ∆τ is achieved by
a combination of random gaussian displacements and systematic moves under the inﬂuence of the quantum forces.
Detailed balance is ensured by use of a generalized Metropolis scheme at each time step [21].

The ground state energy E0 can then be calculated from averaging the local energy over the asymptotic distribution,

according to

In the present study the ratio [Φ0(R)/ΨT (R)] is evaluated by use of the descendant weighting procedure as described
in ref. [22]. All distributions shown here are computed with this method. We shall analyze speciﬁcally the two
dimensional density distribution ρ(r, z) of the p-H2 molecules around the OCS molecule,

where z = R cos ϑ is deﬁned to lie along the OCS axis, and the polar radius r = R sin ϑ is perpendicular to this axis.
We shall also show the pair angular distribution function:

normalized such that

Here φij is the angle between two p-H2 molecules and the OCS axis, in a plane perpendicular to the molecular axis.
Therefore, P12(φ) is a three body distribution function integrated over all variables with the constraint of ﬁxed φ. It
describes the probability to ﬁnd a p-H2 molecule at an angle φ from another molecule that is arbitrarily located at
φ=0◦.

In all the DMC calculations presented here, the guiding function ΨT (R) is given by eqs. (6-8). We use an ensemble of
1000 walkers whose initial distribution is taken from a VMC run. A variable weight wk(τ ), with wk(0) = 1, is assigned
to each walker. During the imaginary time propagation the weights can vary between wmin and wmax according to
the mixed weights/branching scheme described in ref. [18], and the reference energy is updated continously according
to the growth energy estimator

k wk(τ ). Dependence on the size of the time step ∆τ has been carefully analyzed in order to

eliminate any signiﬁcant bias. A resulting optimal value of ∆τ =50 a.u. is used. After performing a thousand steps
to equilibrate the initial ensemble, averages are calculated by performing block averaging on blocks consisting of 500
steps, and subsequent averaging of these block averages.

C. Excited state calculations

1. Projection operator imaginary time spectral evolution (POITSE) method

The POITSE method allows the calculation of excited state energies from a stochastic solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation without imposing any nodal approximations. In this scheme, the excited state energies are extracted from

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

the two-sided inverse Laplace transform of an imaginary time correlation function ˜κ(τ ) that is obtained by a multi-
dimensional Monte Carlo integration combined with zero temperature diﬀusion Monte Carlo sidewalks. The basic
formulation of the method has been previously discussed [23], and thus we present here only a brief summary of the
main ideas, together with details speciﬁc to the present study.

The analysis starts with the spectral function

κ(ω) =

| hψ0 | ˆA | ψni |2 δ(E0 − En + ω),

Xn

where {| ψni} and {En} are a complete set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the Hamiltonian ˆH, respectively.
ˆA is a local operator that projects, at least approximately, | ψ0i into the particular excited state of interest | ψni.
Performing a two-sided Laplace transform of eq. (24) results in the imaginary time correlation function

˜κ(τ ) =

exp (−ωτ )κ(ω)dω

| hψ0 | ˆA | ψni |2 e−(En−E0)τ .
=

+∞

Z

−∞

Xn

The matrix element of eq. (26) involves only the ground state and, therefore, it can be computed by using a multi-
dimensional Monte Carlo (MC) integration over the distribution | ψ0 |2 and then performing a DMC sidewalk at each
MC point. In most cases, however, the exact ground state | ψ0i is not known. For practical purposes, one typically
employs a trial function | ΨT i and a reference energy Eref . These approximate | ψ0i and E0, respectively, as closely
as possible. Use of a reference energy not equal to the exact ground state energy modiﬁes the decay rate of all terms in
eq. (27) by a constant factor Eref − E0. It has been shown in ref. [23] that this dependence on the arbitrary reference
energy can be eliminated by introducing the normalization factor

Thus, replacing | ψ0i, E0 in eq. (26) with | ΨT i, Eref , respectively, and dividing by the additional normalization
factor of eq. (28), leads to the desired time correlation function

hΨT | exp [−( ˆH − Eref )τ ] | ΨT i.

˜κ(τ ) =

hΨT | ˆA exp [−( ˆH − Eref )τ ] ˆA† | ΨT i
hΨT | exp [−( ˆH − Eref )τ ] | ΨT i

.

From eq. (27) it is clear that the imaginary time decay of ˜κ(τ ) contains information about energy diﬀerences En − E0.
Therefore calculation of the numerical inverse Laplace transform of ˜κ(τ ) provides the corresponding spectral function
κ(ω) whose peak positions correspond to the excitation energies En.

The ﬁrst step in the evaluation of ˜κ(τ ) is a variational Monte Carlo walk in which an initial ensemble of 1000
walkers distributed according to Ψ2
T is generated. The starting VMC ensemble is then propagated for 8000 steps of
∆τ =50 a.u. by a DMC sidewalk, during which eq. (29) is sampled. The trial function is given by eqs. (6-8), and the
VMC and DMC implementations have been described in the previous sections.

As well known, the numerical inversion of ˜κ(τ ) to obtain κ(ω) is an ill-conditioned problem, especially when
Monte Carlo noise is non-negligible and/or when the spectral function κ(ω) contains multiple overlapping peaks of
comparable intensity. Thus a judicious choice of the operator ˆA is necessary to ensure that the time-dependence of
˜κ(τ ) is dominated by only one or few well-separated energy diﬀerences.

In order to compute the rotational excitations of OCS inside p-H2 clusters we employ here projectors ˆA proportional
to the molecular Wigner functions Dj
mk(α, β, γ). Here, α, β, γ are the three Euler angles that deﬁne the orientation
of the molecular frame in the arbitrary space-ﬁxed frame, and j, m, k are the OCS rotational quantum numbers. We
focus in particular on Dj
00, with j ranging from 1 to 5. These projectors, except for a numerical constant, correspond
to the rotational eigenfunctions of a linear molecule. They are also equivalent to the eigenfunctions of a symmetric
top rotor with k=0. They are functions only of the second Euler angle and are expressed in terms of the Legendre
polynomials, i.e., Dj
00 ∝ Pj (cos β). Therefore, ˆA accesses states in which the total angular momentum J is carried
primarily by the OCS molecule, i.e. J ≈ j.

The inverse Laplace transform of ˜κ(τ ) is performed here using the implementation of the Maximum Entropy
(MaxEnt) method as described in ref. [24]. Our use of this approach is identical to that employed in previous
POITSE applications [23,25–27]. Since the maximum entropy analysis requires independent samples of ˜κ(τ ), the initial

6

conﬁguration for each DMC sidewalk is taken from the VMC walk every 200 steps apart, to minimize correlations
between successive sidewalks. In the present study, 8000-10000 independent decays are required to produce a converged
spectral function κ(ω) for all the projectors deﬁned before. We have also calculated the excitation energies by ﬁtting
the imaginary time correlation function with a sum of exponentials as was done in ref. [28], i.e.,

Typically, three terms in this sum are suﬃcient to obtain convergent results. In eq. (30), the coeﬃcient cn is the
spectral weight of the particular excitation En contributing to ˜κ(τ ). In order to discuss the convergence of our results
we also analyse the quantity ǫJ (τ ) deﬁned as [28]

˜κ(τ ) =

is the largest spectral weight obtained from the exponential ﬁt of eq. (30).

2. Clamped coordinate quasiadiabatic diﬀusion Monte Carlo

Excited state energies can also be calculated using the clamped coordinate quasiadiabatic diﬀusion Monte Carlo
(ccQA-DMC) method proposed by Quack and Suhm [29]. We have previously applied this approach to analysis of
small OCS(4He)N clusters [30] and the OCS(p-H2) complex [31].

The key idea of this approximate approach is the assumption that the whole cluster follows the rotation of the
dopant molecule. In the present implementation the instantaneous inertial tensor I(τ ) is computed at each step of
the DMC propagation. Diagonalization of I(τ ) provides an eﬀective centrifugal potential VJ,Ka,Kc(R), where J is
the total angular momentum quantum number, and Ka, Kc are the pseudo-quantum numbers of an asymmetric rotor
[32]. Adding VJ,Ka,Kc(R) to V (R) of eq. (1) leads to a modiﬁed Hamiltonian operator

ˆHJ,Ka,Kc(R) = ˆH(R) + VJ,Ka,Kc(R).

(32)

The RB-DMC method can then be used to solve the imaginary time Schr¨odinger equation for ˆHJ,Ka,Kc(R), given
a ﬁxed set of J, Ka and Kc. Furthermore, because ˆH(R) and ˆHJ,Ka,Kc(R) diﬀer only by the centrifugal potential
term, a correlated sampling scheme [33] can be used to calculate E0 together with all excitation energies EJ,Ka,Kc in
a single DMC run. This signiﬁcantly reduces the statistical errors and also reduces the computational cost.

Since the instantaneous inertial tensor is a coordinate operator, this is implicitly determined by the mixed distribu-
tion ΨT Φ0 (see eq.(18)). Consequently the ccQA-DMC excited states energies may be indirectly subject to some trial
function bias. We discuss this and other possible sources of inaccuracy in the ccQA-DMC approach in Section III B 2.

Both the VMC and DMC ground state energies for the OCS(p-H2)N clusters are listed in Table II. We also report
there the energy per p-H2 molecule derived from the DMC results (column 4). The total energy decreases as a
function of N , indicating that the cluster is stabilized by adding p-H2 molecules. One can also see that up to N =5 the
diﬀerence between DMC and VMC energies is less than 5%. It subsequently increases for the largest sizes, illustrating
the diﬃculty of designing accurate trial functions for clusters with N ≥ 6. The fact that N =5 corresponds to some
”magic” number is supported by inspection of the energy per single p-H2 molecule. This quantity ﬁrst decreases with
N , reaching a minimum value at N =5 and then rapidly increases. A similar behavior was seen in the energetics for
OCS(4He)N clusters [8].

The diﬀerence between clusters with N ≤ 5 and those with N > 5 becomes more evident if one considers the
para-hydrogen chemical potential µN = E0(N ) − E0(N − 1). This is reported in Fig. 3. After decreasing up to
N =4, µN remains approximately constant at N =4-5. It then markedly increases when N =6. For N =7-8 µN is again

constant at a value slightly below the value found for N =6. This indicates that the OCS(p-H2)6 cluster is relatively
less stable than the others.

The above energetic analysis suggests that some structural change might be occuring between N =5 and N =6. This
hypothesis is conﬁrmed on inspection of Fig. 4 where we show 2-dimensional contour plots of the number density ρ(r, z)
deﬁned in eq. (20). Up to N =5 the ground state structure of the clusters corresponds to a single ring of para-hydrogen
molecules around the OCS axis. For these small sizes the p-H2 molecules are all located in the global minimum region
of the OCS-(p-H2) interaction (see Figs. 2a and 2b). From N =6 onwards, a second ring appears in the region close to
the oxygen side. Note that this ring is not located in either of the two collinear local minima. Integration of ρ(r, z)
for the N =8 cluster shows that ﬁve p-H2 molecules are still located in the ﬁrst ring, while the other three are found
in the second one. Note that while the ﬁrst (lowest) local minimum of the OCS-(p-H2) interaction potential is located
at the sulfur end (ϑ=0◦) and is about 20 cm−1 deeper than the second one at the oxygen end (see Fig. 2b), after the
global minimum region is ﬁlled up with ﬁve p-H2 molecules, no p-H2 molecule is found at ϑ ≈ 0◦. This can be easily
explained by considering the additional eﬀect of the (p-H2)-(pH2) interaction. This provides an attractive potential
that pulls the added p-H2 molecules closer to the ﬁrst ring. Because of the saddle point at ϑ=53.5◦ the region close
to the oxygen side (ϑ=0◦) is preferred over the sulphur side (ϑ=180◦).

We also note that in the density plots, the peak corresponding to the ﬁrst ring is separated from that of the second
ring by a region where the density is essentially zero. This indicates that after the ﬁrst ring is completed there is no
delocalization of the other p-H2 molecules along the OCS axis. This is in contrast to what was previously found for
4He in the analogous OCS(4He)N clusters, where extensive helium delocalization is evident [8,30].

Although signiﬁcant information about the cluster structures can be extracted from the number density ρ(r, z), this
does not provide any information concerning the localization of the p-H2 molecules in planes perpendicular to the
OCS axis. In the left panels of Fig. 5 we therefore show the pair angular distribution function deﬁned in eq. (21), for
clusters with N =2-6. In the right panels of the same ﬁgure we also report for comparison the corresponding results
obtained for the same size OCS(4He)N clusters. In this case we have used the He-OCS interaction potential of ref.
[34] and the He-He potential proposed by Aziz and co-workers [35]. P12(φ) describes here the pair distribution of
para-hydrogen (helium) in the ring located in the global minimum region of the OCS-(p-H2) (OCS-He) interaction.
At ﬁrst sight it is evident that the OCS(p-H2)N clusters show a stronger localization of the p-H2 molecules in this
ring. It is also important to note that up to N =5 there is a zero probability to ﬁnd two p-H2 molecules closer than
their repulsive hard-core diameter (∼ 3 ˚A). This evidence together with the fact that this ring is ﬁnite and eﬀectively
one-dimensional implies that only cyclic permutations among p-H2 molecules are possible. For larger N , instead, the
probability to occupy sites outside the global potential well is ﬁnite (see Fig. 4), and this results in a ﬁnite value of
P12(φ) at φ=0◦.

The analysis of the pair angular distribution also provides some insight into the relative rigidity of the ﬁrst ring
as a function of the number of p-H2 molecules. For N =2, P12(φ) shows two distinct peaks and thus the structure of
the cluster can be reasonably described as a ”rigid” p-H2 dimer that is located perpendicular to the OCS axis. When
N =3-4 the ring is instead ”ﬂoppy”, as evidenced by the broad central band in P12(φ). In particular, we note that for
N =4 there are not three distinct peaks corresponding to three p-H2 molecules located at well-deﬁned angle φ with
the fourth at φ=0◦. This means that the four p-H2 molecules are not arranged in a square conﬁguration around the
OCS, i.e., the ground state structure of OCS(p-H2)4 is not exactly symmetric.

The most interesting aspect, however, is the structural transition that occurs when N =5. For this cluster size, in
fact, P12(φ) looks entirely diﬀerent. This now shows four sharp peaks, corresponding to four well-localized p-H2 with
the reference p-H2 at φ=0◦. The OCS(p-H2)5 structure can thus be rationalized as a ”rigid” ring of para-hydrogen
molecules around the OCS axis. In contrast, the OCS(4He)N clusters appear to be delocalized in the φ degree of
freedom and, consequently, very ﬂoppy for all the sizes shown in Fig. 5.

In Section III.A we have seen that the ﬁrst few para-hydrogen molecules form a ring around the OCS axis. However,
as discussed there, for N < 5 the ring is not complete and the p-H2 are not symmetrically arranged (see Fig. 5). This
implies that the molecular axis is not the axis of symmetry of the whole cluster which, as a result, has an asymmetric
structure.

As well known, the rotational eigenfunctions for an asymmetric rotor are given by a linear combination of the
Wigner functions [36]. In POITSE calculations, however, we use projection operators that are proportional only to
one of these functions, namely Dj
00(α, β, γ). Furthermore, the three Euler angles are deﬁned with respect to a frame

ﬁxed on the OCS molecule that, as noted above, does not coincide with the principal axis frame of the whole cluster.
As a consequence of this, the excited state wavefunction obtained after the action of Dj
00(α, β, γ) on the ground state
wavefunction, is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, it can have a non zero overlap with excited states
diﬀerent from those we are considering here. In a symmetric top limit, these states correspond to states with J=j
and K=k=0, where J is the total angular momentum quantum number, and K, k are the quantum numbers for the
total angular momentum projection along the space-ﬁxed and the body-ﬁxed z axis, respectively.

That this is indeed the case we are facing here becomes clear if one looks carefully at Fig. 6. In the right panels,
we show the spectral function obtained from the Maximun Entropy algorithm for N =1-4 and J=1-3. In the left
panels we show the corresponding quantity ǫJ (τ ) (solid lines) of eq. (31), and the excited state energies (dotted lines)
obtained from the exponential ﬁts, eq. (30).

It is evident that for J=1 the quantity ǫJ (τ ) is constant in time for all the four clusters, indicating that the projection
operator D1
00 accesses primarily one eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. However, for J=2 and J=3, ǫJ (τ ) ﬁrst increases,
reaches a maximum value corresponding to the excitation with the largest spectral weight, and then decreases, as a
function of τ . Furthermore, the larger is J, the more pronounced is this last decrease. This is the consequence of
the fact that, because of the asymmetric structure of these smallest clusters, the projection operators Dj
00 can access
diﬀerent rotational excited states. Thus the corresponding imaginary time correlation function contains more than
one eigenergy and ǫ(τ ) varies as these eigenenergies are accessed. It is also important to note that when N =4, the
OCS axis more closely approximates the axis of symmetry for the whole cluster, and hence ǫ(τ ) becomes constant in
time also for the higher values of J.

From these considerations, it follows that the inversion of the correlation function ˜κ(τ ) is technically more diﬃcult
for the highest values of J and for N ≤ 3. In fact, while for J=1 the result of inversion is independent of the time τ ,
for J=2 and J=3 MaxEnt provides a stable spectral function with a narrow peak only when the inversion range is
restricted to the time interval before ǫ(τ ) decreases. The same sensitivity to time interval is found when the inversion
is perfomed using the exponential ﬁt. Identical results are obtained from the two inversion procedures. However, in
the case of the exponential ﬁt, the optimal ﬁt results in a very large χ2 value (χ2 ≈ 5 × 105), indicating that caution
must be used when dealing with this procedure.

From N =5 onwards, we have seen that a rigid ring of ﬁve p-H2 molecules is formed around the OCS axis and thus
the molecular axis can be reasonably identiﬁed with the axis of symmetry of the whole cluster. As a consequence of
this, the Dj
00’s become ”good” projection operators each of which accesses only one eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.
The inversion of ˜κ(τ ) is thus simpler for these sizes and we are able to extract the excited state energies for J ranging
from 1 to 5. In Fig. 7 we report, as an example, ǫJ (τ ) and κ(ω) for N =5 and N =8. From the use of the Maximum
Entropy method we have found that, while the peak positions are independent of the length of the time interval,
narrower peaks can be obtained if only the central part (from τ =1.0×105 a.u. to τ =3.0×105 a.u.) of the time decay
is considered. For these cluster sizes the exponential ﬁt also provides identical results as MaxEnt, but again the
associated χ2 is very large (see above).

This detailed analysis of the imaginary time dependence of ǫ(τ ) shows that the complexes become signiﬁcantly

symmetric for N ≥ 5.

2. ccQA-DMC results

In Fig. 8 we show the rotational excitation energies EJ,Ka,Kc with J=1-3 calculated by use of the ccQA-DMC
approach for N =1-8. Each EJ,Ka,Kc exhibits a monotonic decrease as N increases. The patterns resemble those of
slightly asymmetric prolate rotors. From N =4 onwards, the energy diﬀerences between those excited states that are
degenerate in the limit of a perfect symmetric prolate rotor become smaller and smaller. This indicates that, as the
POITSE results have already shown (Figs. 6 and 7), the clusters become more symmetric. Note that N =5 is the
least prolate structure and most symmetric structure in this size range. This can be understood as a consequence of
the fact that this cluster possesses a single complete ring. It is also possible to see from Fig. 8 that the structural
transition between N =5 and N =6 evident in Fig. 4 manifests itself in a change of the slope in EJ,Ka,Kc. This is
particularly evident for the lowest excited states (bottom panel).

In Fig. 9 we compare the exact POITSE with the approximate ccQA-DMC energy levels for J=1-3. Because
the cluster structures are those of slightly asymmetric prolate rotors, the excitations extracted from the molecular
projection operators in POITSE correspond to those of states with J=j, Ka=0 and Kc=1. The two sets of results
show generally similar behavior but there are nevertheless several signiﬁcant diﬀerences. For N =1 and N =2 the
POITSE values are systematically higher than the corresponding ccQA-DMC values, indicating that for these sizes
the p-H2 molecules are not as rigidly bound as assumed by ccQA-DMC. For N =3-4, in contrast, the two sets of
results are identical for J=1 but diﬀer increasingly as J increases, with the greatest discrepancies being seen at J=3.

9

Such a pattern of diﬀerences is identical to what would be expected for excitations lowered by centrifugal distortion
below the corresponding rigid molecule values. This can be rationalized by considering that for these two sizes the
pair angular distribution function has shown that the structures are quite ﬂoppy (Fig. 5). Consequently, for higher J
values the p-H2 density can be increasingly easily distorted. The rotational energies indicate that N =3 is therefore the
ﬂoppiest complex. This eﬀect consistently disappears for N =5 and N =6 when a complete ring of ﬁve p-H2 molecules
is formed around the OCS axis. At these sizes the POITSE and ccQA-DMC energy levels are essentially coincident,
implying that the true energy levels (POITSE) correspond now to a rigid complex in which all p-H2 molecules are
rigidly coupled to the OCS rotation (ccQA-DMC). We can rationalize these diﬀerent behaviors for the pairs N =3-4
and N =5-6 by a coupling of the ring ”breathing” mode to the overall rotation in clusters with an incomplete p-H2 ring
at the global potential minimum (see Fig. 4). Such coupling results in a centrifugal distortion of the cluster, due to
expansion of this ﬂoppy para-hydrogen ring. The vibrational ”breathing” mode is relatively facile for an incomplete
ring. When this is ﬁlled with 5 pH2, the (p-H2)-(p-H2) interactions eﬀectively lock the para-hydrogen molecules into
a more rigid structure (see Fig. 5 and eﬀectively eliminate centrifugal distortion due to ring ”breathing”.

For N =7-8 quite diﬀerent behavior is seen. Here the POITSE values lie slightly below the ccQA-DMC energies for
all J values, including J=1. This does not correspond to the pattern of a centrifugal distortion away from a rigid
complex. The systematically lower POITSE energies for these cluster sizes are somewhat surprising. In fact, because
of the rigid coupling assumptions implicit in the approach, the ccQA-DMC energies are expected to provide a lower
limit, at least for the lowest value of J where non-rigidity eﬀects are less important. Resolution of these diﬀerences
lies in the implicit dependence of ccQA-DMC on a ”mixed” ground state density. Fig. 10 compares the ϑ dependence
of the ”mixed”, eq. (18), and ”pure”, eq. (19), ground state densities for N =1-8. We see that while for N =1-6 these
densities are very similar, for N =7-8 the ”mixed” state density overestimates the true density in the region between
the two rings, at the expense of the second ring density. This results in an underestimate of the moments of inertia
IB and IC , and hence in an overestimate of the rotational energies obtained from ccQA-DMC.

3. Rotational constants

The rotational excited state energies obtained from the POITSE method are ﬁtted using a symmetric top Hamil-

tonian. For states with K=0, this becomes

E(J) = BavgJ(J + 1) − DJ 2(J + 1)2.

(33)

Because the ground state cluster structures correspond to those of slightly asymmetric prolate top rotors, at least
for the smallest sizes (Figs. 4 and 5), the averaged rotational constant Bavg refers to (B + C)/2. Both Bavg and the
distortion constant D are shown as a function of N in Fig. 11.

The averaged rotational constant Bavg decreases as a function of N , showing a marked change in its slope between
N =5 and N =6, exactly when the p-H2 molecules begin to solvate the oxygen side of the OCS. As we have discussed
in the previous section, at N =6, one p-H2 molecule occupies a site closer to the OCS axis and more distant from the
perpendicular rotation axes. Consequently the moment of inertia increases providing a larger reduction of Bavg. It is
also important to note that a similar magnitude decrease of Bavg from N =1 to N =3 and from N =6 to N =8 is found.
This suggests that the second ring around the OCS axis has similar azimuthal distribution features as the ﬁrst one.
The distortion constant D is ∼ 4 × 10−4 cm−1 for N =1, appearing somewhat larger than that for the OCS-4He
complex [5], although the large error bars make a meaningful comparison impossible. D is smaller for N =2, nearly
zero, providing more evidence that the ﬁrst two p-H2 molecules constitute a near ”rigid” dimer interacting with the
OCS. Beyond N =2, the distortion constant shows a maximum value at N =3 that, as we have already discussed above
(Section III.B.2), corresponds to the ﬂoppiest structure. This is followed by a slightly lower, but still signiﬁcant, value
at N =4 and a subsequent decrease with N , because of the increasingly rigid packing of p-H2 molecules around the
OCS. The relatively substantial values of D for N =3-4 are due to the distortion of the ring deriving from coupling
to the ring ”breathing” mode, described in Section III.B.2 above. As noted there, for N =5-6 ﬁve hydrogen molecules
are now locked in the ring, which will push this breathing mode higher in energy and reduce its amplitude, thereby
reducing the eﬀects of its coupling to the cluster rotation. The continued decrease of D for larger N (N =7-8), is very
interesting in this context. For N =7-8 the second shell contains 2 and 3 para-hydrogen molecules respectively. One
might therefore expect that for the N =8 cluster, the ”breathing” mode of the second 3-molecule ring would similarly
couple to the rotation and cause some centrifugal distortion. However, interaction of the 3 p-H2 molecules in this
secondary ring with the 5 molecules in the primary ring stabilizes and localizes the secondary ring, reducing the eﬀects
of any rotational coupling to its breathing mode. Consequently, there are no appreciable centrifugal distortion eﬀects
due to growth of the second ring.

10

As a result of the approximations made in the method, the ccQA-DMC calculations can provide estimates for all
three rotational constants (A, B, C) within its rigid coupling assumption. These are reported in Table III together
with a comparison of the resulting values of Bavg with those obtained from POITSE. The ccQA-DMC values conﬁrm
the increasingly symmetric prolate structures as N increases. For N =5 the rotational constants B and C diﬀer by
only 0.013 cm−1, while for N ≥ 6 this diﬀerence is less than 0.01 cm−1. We interpret these as essentially symmetric
top structures. The diﬀerences between the two sets of results for Bavg are very small for all cluster sizes studied here,
indicating that the rigid coupling approximation made in the ccQA-DMC method is generally a good approximation.
Moreover, the diﬀerences seen here are smaller than those found in the analogous OCS(4He)N clusters [10,28], implying
that the complexes with para-hydrogen are generally more rigid than those with helium. However, the ccQA-DMC
approach does rely on several approximations that can cause small inaccuracies. We have already noted one problem,
namely the implicit dependence on mixed densities that aﬀected the ccQA-DMC energies for the N =7-8 clusters.
Another general problem is that the ccQA-DMC method overestimates the degree of asymmetry of the clusters, since
the averaging of ﬂuctuations can dominate the results even for highly symmetric structures. Thus for the symmetric
OCS(p-H2)5 cluster, for which the ground state structure is clearly symmetric in the azimuthal degree of freedom
(Fig. 5), ccQA-DMC nevertheless yields B 6= C. This suggests that some small quantitative inaccuracies might be
present for N ≥ 5.

IV. RELATION TO EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS

In the following, the present results will be discussed in light of the existing experimental studies of OCS(p-H2)N

complexes.

For N =1 a direct comparison with the data reported in ref. [5] is possible. The high resolution spectrum for the
OCS(p-H2) complex was observed and analysed using the conventional asymmetric rotor Hamiltonian in the a-reduced
form of Watson [37]. From that analysis all the rotational parameters were obtained. Structural properties as the
intermolecular distance R and the Jacobi angle ϑ were also derived. As discussed before, the POITSE calculations
provide rotational excited energies corresponding only to states with J=j, Ka=0 and Kc=J. Therefore, from this set
of calculations it is not possible to extract all the rotational constants. In Table IV we report the energies calculated
from POITSE and make a comparison with the corresponding experimental values. Excellent agreement is found for
all the three excited states considered here. The values for hRi and hϑi calculated by DMC and reported in Table V
also show a very good agreement with the corresponding experimentally determined quantities. A complete analysis
of the ccQA-DMC results for N =1 was previously reported [31].

For N > 1 no experimental results are available for the pure OCS(p-H2)N clusters.

Infrared spectra for these
clusters were however observed in pure 4He and in mixed 4He/3He droplets [1–3]. Although a direct comparison with
those results is not possible because it is diﬃcult to estimate the eﬀect of the surrounding helium droplet, we may
still make some qualitative comparisons. The DMC calculations (ground state and ccQA-DMC) provide asymmetric
structures for clusters with N < 5 (Figs. 5-8, and Table III). This is conﬁrmed by analysis of POITSE results for
the rotational excited state energies (Figs. 6-7 and discussion in Section III.B.1). The present results are thus in
good agreement with the experimental observations that allow a ﬁt of the rotational spectrum using a symmetric top
Hamiltonian only for N ≥ 5 [2]. For N = 5, the rigidity of the single ring structure seen in the DMC structures and
in the POITSE energies provides justiﬁcation for the permutation symmetry arguments made to explain the lack of
a Q-branch in the spectrum at this size [2].

It is important to point out that the experimental data in helium droplets suggest that the principal ring located
in the minimum region of the OCS-(p-H2) interaction should contain six p-H2 molecules [3]. This appears to be
in contradiction with the present results which show the ﬁrst ring containing only 5 para-hydrogen molecules. The
diﬀerence can be easily explained when the eﬀect of the helium density in the droplet is taken into account. It has
recently been demonstrated with path integral Monte Carlo calculations that in the mixed cluster OCS(p-H2)M (4He)N ,
six p-H2 molecules are eﬀectively arranged in the primary ring [38]. A ring of six p-H2 molecules is also found in the
pure OCS(p-H2)N clusters with N >8 [10]. The number of para-hydrogen molecules in the primary ring depends on
the balance of (p-H2)-(p-H2), (p-H2)-OCS, and (p-H2)-4He interactions.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The work reported here presents a detailed study of the energetics and structures of the OCS(p-H2)N clusters with
N =1-8. The rigid-body diﬀusion Monte Carlo method has been employed to calculate the ground state properties.
Analysis of the total energy as a function of the cluster size N shows that the clusters are stabilized by adding p-H2

11

molecules. Analysis of the chemical potential µN indicates that clusters with N =4-5 are relatively the most stable.
For these two cluster sizes the calculation of the p-H2 density distribution shows that a single ring of p-H2 is formed
around the OCS axis and is located in the global minimum region of the OCS-(pH2) interaction.

Inspection of the p-H2 angular distribution inside this ring provides important informations about its rigidity. For
N =2 the cluster is eﬀectively constituted by a near ”rigid” p-H2 dimer bound to the OCS molecule. The clusters with
N =3-4 appear to be ﬂoppy. When N =5 the ring is complete and the p-H2 molecules are again ”rigidly” arranged
around the molecular axis. Consequently, the OCS(p-H2)5 cluster corresponds to a symmetric structure.

The rotational energies for excited states with J ≈ j have been also computed as a function of the cluster size N by
using the POITSE method. Comparison with results obtained from a rigid coupling approximation, the ccQA-DMC
approach, shows that over this size range the clusters of OCS with p-H2 are to a ﬁrst approximation fairly ”rigid”,
showing less deviations from near ”rigid” behavior for N =6-8 than do complexes of OCS with helium [10,28]. It has
been shown that the detailed variations in rotational spectra of the clusters with N =1-8 can be readily explained in
terms of their structural features. Thus, for N ≤ 4 the rotational spectra correspond to those of slightly asymmetric
prolate rotors with signiﬁcant centrifugal distortion for N =3-4 that is assigned to coupling of the rotational motion
to a ”breathing” mode vibration of the partially ﬁlled para-hydrogen ring. This coupling is suppressed at N =5 when
the ring is complete and the (p-H2)-(p-H2) interactions eﬀectively lock the para-hydrogen molecules into a more rigid
structure. For N ≥ 5 prolate symmetric top spectra are therefore obtained with negligible distortion constants. Some
quantitative inaccuracies in the ccQA-DMC method were seen to arise when the second ring is growing (N =7-8) and
when the cluster is highly symmetric (N =5).

Comparison with the experimental data for the N =1 OCS(p-H2) complex shows excellent quantitative agreement
for both the energy levels and the structural parameters. For N ≥ 2 no experimental data are available for the pure
OCS(p-H2)N clusters. A qualitative comparison of the main features of the cluster structures with conclusions drawn
from the experimental results for the OCS(p-H2)N clusters in the mixed 4He/3He droplets shows good agreement, with
the main diﬀerence being the helium-induced modiﬁcation of the N =6 structure from a 5-membered to 6-membered
ring. The rigidity of the highly symmetric N =5 structure provides strong support for the arguments that excited
states of this are restricted by nuclear permutation symmetry, resulting in a lack of Q-branch in the OCS rotational
spectrum at low temperatures [3].

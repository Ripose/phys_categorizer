Abstract

Sodium atoms and clusters (N

5) on graphite (0001) are studied using density functional

≤

×

theory, pseudopotentials and periodic boundary conditions. A single Na atom is observed to bind

at a hollow site 2.45 ˚A above the surface with an adsorption energy of 0.51 eV. The small diﬀusion

barrier of 0.06 eV indicates a ﬂat potential energy surface.

Increased Na coverage results in a

weak adsorbate-substrate interaction, which is evident in the larger separation from the surface in

the cases of Na3, Na4, Na5, and the (2

2) Na overlayer. The binding is weak for Na2, which has

a full valence electron shell. The presence of substrate modiﬁes the structures of Na3, Na4, and

Na5 signiﬁcantly, and both Na4 and Na5 are distorted from planarity. The calculated formation

energies suggest that clustering of atoms is energetically favorable, and that the open shell clusters

(e.g. Na3 and Na5) can be more abundant on graphite than in the gas phase. Analysis of the

lateral charge density distributions of Na and Na3 shows a charge transfer of

0.5 electrons in

∼

both cases.

INTRODUCTION

Graphite is a semimetal that is widely utilized in experimental surface physics. The

planar geometry and weak van der Waals -type interlayer interaction make it possible to

split ﬂat, chemically inert, and clean graphite (0001) surfaces (highly oriented pyrolytic

graphite, HOPG), which are ideal for studying adsorption layers and clusters. The electronic

2D semimetal properties of graphite are well-known both experimentally and theoretically.

For instance, density functional theory (DFT) has provided information about the valence

charge density, electronic density of states, band structure, elastic constants, and equation

of state.1,2,3,4

An interesting research ﬁeld considers alkali metal atoms and clusters on graphite. Reac-

tivity and metallic properties make alkali metals exciting both for nanotechnological applica-

tions and basic science, and the properties of adsorbed alkali metal atoms on HOPG evolve

as a function of coverage. Initially, a dispersed and highly polarized phase (“correlated liq-

uid”) is found where alkali atoms maintain a maximum distance between each other. After

a critical density of adatoms is reached, a nucleation to more closely packed conﬁgurations

(islands) occurs.5 Alkali metals seem to have a higher charge transfer to HOPG with lower

coverage, and an increase in adatom density tends to re-organize the charge into the alkali

metal layer forming a two-dimensional metallic state that has a small surface corrugation and

is almost decoupled from the substrate.5,6,7,8,9 It has been proposed that alkali-metal-plated

graphite could have practical applications as a substrate in studying normal and superﬂuid

He ﬁlms.6,10

Despite the similar electronic structure of alkali metals, deviations in island formation

and interaction with HOPG are observed as the atomic number increases. While lithium

atoms either intercalate between the graphene layers4 or form a planar incommensurate hcp

superstructure on HOPG,11 it has been suggested that sodium nucleates only in buckled

(110) bcc overlayers.12,13 The larger alkali atoms (K,Ru,Cs) are found to intercalate via

surface defects6,9 or to adsorb in a (2

2) phase occupying hollow sites of the hexagonal

substrate.6,9,14,15 In addition, cesium can exist in an incommensurate hexagonal or a more

×

sparse (√7

√7)R19.11◦ phase,6,14,15 and a dense (√3

√3)R30◦ structure has been pro-

×

×

posed for potassium.16 Obviously, the above observations are related to the atomic radius

and ionization potential of the alkali atom in question, which aﬀect both the adatom-adatom

2

and adatom-surface interactions.

The ﬁrst experimental studies considered metal islands and metal-layers on graphite. A

more controlled treatment of adsorbates is challenging, and it is diﬃcult to study separated

atoms and size-selected small clusters. Contemporary experimental techniques are able to

deal with the practical diﬃculties such as the substrate temperature, surface defects, kinetic

energy of cluster deposition (“soft-landing”), and cluster aggregation.18 Theoretical studies

concern mostly single atoms19,20,21,22 or atomic layers on graphite formed by periodic bound-

ary conditions.7,8,23 However, research on supported clusters is needed because they form a

bridge between isolated atoms and ordered nanolayers, and they may have nanotechnolog-

ical importance (quantum dots, catalysis). Several attempts to model small clusters and

molecules on HOPG have been made,8,20,21,24,25,26,27,28,29 but the large number of substrate

atoms and the semimetallic nature of graphite (k-points) make reliable calculations very

demanding.

Various theoretical methods are capable of studying metal atoms and clusters on graphite

(0001). In addition to deciding which theoretical tools to use, a crucial question is how to

model a graphite surface, i.e., how many graphene layers are needed, how large should the

substrate be, and does the adsorbate change the surface geometry? One approach is to

place the metal cluster under study onto an isolated hydrogen-terminated piece of graphite

(“cluster”) that mimics a continuous surface.19,20,21,29 The question then is how large should

the graphite cluster be in order to get realistic results? On the other hand, there is a problem

in optimizing the geometry of the substrate if several graphene layers are involved. This is

due to the fact that the layers are interlocked, and the system (Bernal graphite, stacking

ABAB) is not fully symmetric at the substrate edges. With periodic boundary conditions

one can describe, in principle, a continuous inﬁnite system (“slab”) in the lateral dimensions.

In this case, the problem is the distance between adsorbate replicas, which should be large

enough to exclude charge density overlap. The large substrate that must be used increases

the computational cost greatly.

In the present work, a DFT method with periodic boundary conditions has been used to

model Na atoms and clusters (N

5) on HOPG. The substrate consisted of three graphene

≤

layers with 32 (60) carbon atoms each. It was found that the HOPG potential energy surface

(PES) is very ﬂat with the hollow site of the carbon hexagonal structure being preferred.

Although alkali metal atoms tend to be more weakly bound to the surface when the coverage

3

increases, this tendency is not so clear in small Na clusters. The calculated cluster energetics

favor clustering processes on HOPG, and the stability of open shell clusters (Na3 and Na5)

is increased.

II. SIMULATION METHODS

The calculations have been performed using the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics

(CPMD) package,30 which is based on density functional theory. The electron-ion inter-

action is described by ionic pseudopotentials having the non-local, norm-conserving, and

separable form suggested by Troullier and Martins.31 Periodic boundary conditions are em-

ployed, and the plane wave basis has a kinetic energy cut-oﬀ of 70 Ry. The generalized

gradient-corrected approximation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)32 is adopted for

the exchange-correlation energy density. The electronic Hamiltonian is rediagonalized after

each geometry optimization step, and a ﬁnite temperature functional (T = 1000 K) is used

for the Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital occupancies due to the small energy gap between the occu-

pied and unoccupied states (band gap). The ionic positions are optimized using a conjugate

gradient method until all the components of nuclear gradient are below 1

10−4 a.u.

We model two periodic substrates of Bernal graphite which consist of three graphene

layers (stacking ABA) in orthorhombic supershells of 9.84

16.70 (96 C atoms) and
16.70 ˚A3 (180 C atoms). The smaller substrate with Na3 is shown in Fig. 1

from two perspectives. Our tests for diﬀerent numbers of graphene layers have shown that at

least three layers are needed in order to reach a convergence in Na adsorption.34 The spacing
between the layers is ﬁxed to the experimental value 3.35 ˚A, since the PBE functional used

has problems in describing weak van der Waals-type interactions.4 The choice of z-dimension
keeps the slab replica 10 ˚A apart, which is suﬃcient for most applications. However, a weak
binding of Na2 (and large separation from the surface) forced us to use 2 ˚A larger spacing

in this case. For Na4 and Na5 the interaction between cluster replicas becomes signiﬁcant in

the smaller box, and a larger substrate in x- and y-dimensions is needed, where the minimum
distance between the clusters is now 7.62 and 6.53 ˚A, respectively.

Extensive tests for diﬀerent numbers of k-points have shown that the simple Γ-point

approximation is not reliable for the systems studied. This is manifested by an artiﬁcial

planar elongation of the graphite hexagons during geometry optimization, and is probably

4

related to a strong downward dispersion of the upper σ bands at the Γ-point.1,2 The problem

1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh, and a variation of lateral
does not occur with a 2
dimension results in a value 1.421 ˚A for the C-C nearest neighbor distance (experimental
value 1.420 ˚A). The Na adsorption energies obtained show that a 5

1 mesh is adequate

2
×

×

(see also Table I), whereas the forces are already well converged for the 2

1 mesh. We

5
×

×

2
×

×

have also tested whether it is possible to use a smaller kinetic energy cutoﬀ: In comparison

with 70 Ry, a calculation with 50 Ry yielded 0.17 eV (33 %) weaker binding of Na, and the
related perpendicular distance from the surface increased by 0.19 ˚A (7.8 %). This shows

that the computational cost cannot be reduced without losing accuracy.

The eﬀect of substrate relaxation has been studied by releasing the six nearest C atoms

and reoptimizing the Na-HOPG system geometry. The changes are small (e.g. the C-C
distance 1.424 ˚A) which validates the use of ﬁxed substrate in real applications. A bench

mark calculation for Na-HOPG shows that the local spin density (LSD) approximation

does not improve the results because of the large number of KS states involved and the

nonmagnetic nature of the system. The calculations below are done with spin-degenerate

KS orbitals except for isolated Na atom and Na clusters.

III. RESULTS

In order to map the potential energy surface of a Na-HOPG system, we have optimized

the Na atom position for diﬀerent locations along the surface (see Fig. 2). The results

for adsorption energy (∆E⊥), separation from the surface (d⊥), nearest carbon atom dis-

tances (Na-C), and carbon coordination numbers (NC) are presented in Table I. Here, we do

not approach the real zero-density limit of Na, but the atoms are distributed in 9.84
8.53
˚A intervals due to the periodic boundary conditions applied.35 Inclusion of more k-points

×

enhances binding in a systematic way yielding to an estimate of 0.51 eV for the energy mini-

mum (point 0, 5

1 mesh). Comparison with other locations shows only small deviations

5
×

×

in ∆E⊥ and d⊥, indicating a ﬂat potential energy surface with a maximum variation of 0.07

eV. The points 2 and 4 above Cα and Cβ (Fig. 2) give similar results, which causes increased

symmetry in the PES. These ﬁndings resemble the results by Lamoen and Persson8 who ob-

tained ∆E⊥ = 0.52 eV for a K-HOPG system and a small diﬀusion barrier (variation 0.05

eV). No k-points were used in these calculations, but we expect a systematic shift in ∆E⊥

5

similar to the one we found.

Table II shows the formation energetics of Na atoms and clusters. The formation energy

∆E is divided into two components: the binding energy of a free cluster or a separated

monolayer (∆Eb), and a term (∆E⊥) describing the adsorption energy. Three phases of

Na-HOPG are included in Table II, where Na(I) refers to the initial sparse system, Na(II)

is a commensurate periodic structure with twice as many Na atoms per unit shell as Na(I)
(Na-Na separation 6.51 ˚A), and Na(III) corresponds to the (2

2) Na monolayer with four

×

times the coverage of Na(I) and hexagonal symmetry. The phase Na(II) was encountered as

a byproduct of Na2 stretching, and it corresponds to the maximal separation of Na atoms

allowed by the smaller supershell used. The eﬀect of nearby Na atoms becomes clear in
Na(III), where the separation from the surface is 0.76 ˚A greater. The loss in surface binding

is compensated by the interaction with other Na atoms, and the resulting ∆E per atom

is slightly larger than for Na(I). A similar (2

2) structure is stable for potassium,9 and

theoretical studies have shown that K forms a metallic state on HOPG.6,7,8 Our results

×

corroborate this ﬁnding, but – in the case of Na monolayer – the spacing between Na atoms
(4.92 ˚A) does not match typical Na-Na distances (see Na clusters in Table III), and the

energy diﬀerence with the lower coverage phase Na(I) is relatively small.

The cluster formation energies in Table II reveal signiﬁcant diﬀerences between individual

clusters. Na2 binds only very weakly due to its closed valence electron shell, and the dimer
separation from the surface is 1 ˚A larger than for Na3 and Na4. The same eﬀect is apparent

in the ∆E⊥ values. It is interesting that the deviation of ∆E for 2

1 and 5

2
×

×

1 k-

5
×

×

point meshes becomes smaller as the distance between Na atoms and surface increases (see

e.g. Na3). This implies changes in charge transfer. The larger substrate used for Na4 and

Na5 requires fewer k-points to converge the formation energy, which can be seen as nearly

identical ∆E values. The ∆E values of Na3, Na4, and Na5 are larger than for the (2

2) Na

×

monolayer, which shows that the clustering of Na atoms is preferred.

The optimized cluster structures are related to the ground state geometries of free Na

clusters. For Na3, Na4, and Na5 the corresponding isomers are an isosceles triangle, a

rhombus, and a planar C2v isomer. The clusters are placed on HOPG in a way that assumes

that the hollow site (point 0) is energetically favorable for each Na atom. The related bond

distances, angles, torsional angles, and distances from the surface are given in Table III. As

mentioned above, Na2 binds weakly, and this can also be seen in the very small change in

6

dimer bond length (0.02 ˚A). For the other clusters changes are more obvious: Na3 adopts

a geometry close to an equilateral triangle with signiﬁcant changes in bond lengths and

angles. Na4 bends away from planarity (torsional angle 8.7◦), and the bond lengths increase

systematically, but the angles remain close to the initial values. For Na3 all atoms occupy

similar sites on top of point 5 (see Figs. 1, 2), not far from hexagon centers. The atoms of

Na4 are coordinated with HOPG in two ways: the two corners of the rhombus are above C

atoms and bent towards the substrate (a result contradictory to the PES of Na(I)), whereas

the other two Na atoms are close to the hexagon centers. The geometry and position of Na4

is shown in an electron density isosurface plot in Fig. 3.

The adsorption of Na5 leads to a signiﬁcant distortion from planarity, with the central Na
atom being much farther from the surface (0.69 ˚A) than the other atoms. Simultaneously,
the longest Na-Na bond is broken (4.11 ˚A, see Table III), and the resulting Cs structure (Fig.

4) comprises two identical triangles connected via their apices. As for the other clusters,

changes in bond lengths are considerable, and there are also changes in bond angles. The

Na atoms are coordinated with the surface in three ways: the central atom is on a hollow

site, the two atoms that initially comprised the broken Na-Na bond sit on top of C-C bonds,

and the two corner atoms are directly above C atoms. Here, we have optimized the cluster

geometry with respect to a substrate consisting of two graphene layers alone (120 C atoms).36

The obvious changes are an increased separation of the middle Na atom from the surface
(0.20 ˚A) and a further elongation of the longest (broken) Na-Na bond (0.11 ˚A). The other

bond distances and the formation energy ∆E are unchanged.

The electron density isosurface plot of Na5-HOPG in Fig. 4 illustrates how the density is

distributed within the Na5 cluster. The largest values are obtained inside the two remaining

triangles, but there is a component also in the interstitial region next to the broken (or

elongated) Na-Na bond. The Na atom in the middle has a pronounced hole in the density,

but an atom-centered integration of charge density within a small spherical volume (R = 1.5
˚A) gives similar results (charges) for each Na atom. This is explained by the fact that the

most coordinated Na atom has density contributions from both triangles. Presumably, this

atom prefers a larger distance from the surface and a hollow site because of its higher Na

coordination, whereas the lower coordinated Na atoms tend to acquire positions closer to

carbons and C-C bonds. The same applies to Na4 but on a smaller scale (see Fig. 3).

We have listed on Table IV formation energies for diﬀerent cluster/atom products on

7

top of the HOPG substrate, calculated assuming an initial state of N free Na atoms in

the gas phase. The most obvious feature is the small formation energy of Na2 containing

products. This is caused by the full valence electron shell of Na2 that reduces binding with

the substrate. Even two separated Na atoms are more stable on graphite than a dimer.

For larger systems Na3, Na4, and Na5 are favored, indicating clustering processes, and the

product Na3+Na is slightly higher in formation energy than Na4. The unpaired electron on

the outermost shell of Na3 (and Na) increases binding with HOPG as seen in Table II. A

similar conclusion can be made about the high stability of Na5. This indicates that open

shell clusters can be more abundant on graphite than in the gas phase.

The weak binding of Na2 compared to two separated atoms has suggested to us to inves-

tigate the breaking of this bond. For this purpose the Na2 bond distance has been increased

gradually up to a point where the periodic Na(II) phase is obtained. Each conﬁguration

has been optimized with respect to the surface, and the total energy is calculated with the

1 k-point mesh. Our results show a monotonic increase up to Na(II), which is the
5
5
×
upper limit of Na-Na distance (6.51 ˚A) in the supershell chosen. At this point, the energy

×

is 0.30 eV higher, which should be considered as the lower bound of the Na2 dissociation

energy on HOPG. This is still signiﬁcantly less than the gas phase value 0.68 eV, but the

substrate now causes the interaction between Na atoms to be long-ranged. On the other
hand, Na2 stretches readily; as the Na-Na separation is increased to 4.26 ˚A where both

atoms sit on a hollow site (second nearest hexagons) the total energy change is only 0.09
eV, but the distance d⊥=3.09 ˚A is 0.86 ˚A less. This suggests that Na2 on graphite has very

low frequency vibrational modes in both lateral and perpendicular directions.

Charge transfer between the adsorbate and the substrate is studied in detail in the case

of Na-HOPG and Na3-HOPG,37 and the laterally averaged charge density diﬀerences (∆ρ)

are presented in Fig. 5. In both cases, the oscillating proﬁle of ∆ρ shows that the presence

of adsorbate aﬀects the whole system including the lowermost (third) graphene layer. The

negative node close to the Na/Na3 indicates a charge transfer to the substrate that is partially

counterbalanced by the strong positive peak next to the ﬁrst graphene layer (GR1, see Table

V). The location and shape of the negative node is diﬀerent for Na and Na3: for a single

atom the charge is depleted throughout the whole atomic volume causing a broad minimum

in ∆ρ, whereas for Na3 the minimum is deeper and biased to the lower side of the cluster.

Integration over this area gives values ∆q =

0.47 e and ∆q =

0.48 e for Na and Na3,

−

−

8

respectively. The similar ∆q values indicate that the substrate does not support more excess

charge, and it explains the increased d⊥ for Na3, Na4, Na5 and (2

2) Na monolayer.

×

A layer-by-layer analysis of the graphite substrate in Table V shows that the charge

transferred is distributed over the three layers. In comparison with the middle layer (GR2),

∆q is slightly larger for the lowermost layer (GR3). This is probably a ﬁnite-size eﬀect, a

conclusion that is supported by the ∆ρ proﬁle. The inclusion of k-points leads to more pro-

nounced oscillations near GR2 and GR3, whereas GR1 has more accumulated charge in the

Γ-point approximation. This shows that the charge transferred becomes more delocalized as

k-points are introduced in the lateral dimension. The Γ-point approximation underestimates

the amount of charge transfer also for Na, whereas for Na3 the values are similar. Lamoen
and Persson8 found ∆q =

The electronic densities of valence states (DOS) of Na5-HOPG and HOPG are plotted in

with zero weight and zero gap at the Fermi energy. Our substrate model then captures the

relevant properties of graphite, although the system is ﬁnite in the perpendicular direction.

A very small eﬀect is observed due to the Na5 adsorption, and the characteristic features

of graphite substrate are clearly visible. The conduction band is now being ﬁlled by the Na5

valence electrons, which can be seen as a small peak at the Fermi energy. The band structure

of the three (spin-degenerate) Na5-HOPG conduction states reveals that the dispersion of

the ﬁrst does not correspond to its graphite counterparts (π∗ bands), but resembles more

the valence states (π bands). This is not true for the two other conduction states, where

the lower one shows only minor variation as a function of k, and the higher one resembles

closely the graphite conduction bands. The two uppermost valence states are also aﬀected

by the presence of Na5, which can be seen as smaller dispersion. Together with the lowest

conduction state, this results in a small hump in the DOS next to the minimum separating

conduction and valence bands.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have studied Na atoms and small Na clusters (N

5) on graphite using a DFT

≤

method that uses pseudopotentials and periodic boundary conditions. In order to obtain

reliable results the simulated slab of graphite consists of three graphene layers, and is suf-

ﬁciently large to yield an appropriate separation between the adsorbate replica in lateral

dimension. In addition, a high kinetic energy cutoﬀ (70 Ry) for the plane wave basis set

and k-points make the calculations very demanding in terms of CPU time and memory.

For a dispersed phase, an Na atom has an adsorption energy of 0.51 eV at the hollow site
2.45 ˚A above the surface. The small diﬀusion barrier of 0.06 eV shows that the potential

energy surface of the Na atom is ﬂat. These results are similar to the recent results for NaC60

compounds, where an adsorption energy of 0.65 eV and a diﬀusion barrier of 0.07 eV were

observed at the hexagonal site.39 A higher Na coverage leads to a decreased interaction with
2) monolayer (d⊥ = 3.21 ˚A). The dispersed phase and

the substrate as shown for the (2

×

(2

2) monolayer diﬀer little energetically, and neither is found to be stable experimentally.

×

Instead, the calculated cluster formation energies favor clustering processes (island forma-

tion) in agreement with experiment.6,12,13 The formation energies of the open shell systems

Na, Na3, and Na5 are larger than those of closed shell cases Na2 and Na4. This is related to

the spin-degeneracy of the highest molecular orbital (odd-even staggering) and, in contrast

to free metal clusters, gives rise to increased stability of odd cluster sizes on HOPG.

A charge density analysis for Na and Na3 shows that approximately 0.5 electrons are

transferred to the substrate in both cases, indicating that HOPG does not support much

excess charge, and that polarization eﬀects weaken as the Na coverage is increased. As

shown before for K,6,7,8 this leads to decoupling between the adsorbate and substrate, and a

two-dimensional metallic ﬁlm on HOPG results. In the case of Na clusters, the partial loss

in electron density is evident in signiﬁcant changes in cluster geometries. For example, Na3
is more like a closed shell Na+

3 ion, and consequently, the geometry is closer to an equilateral

triangle than that of a free Na3. An interesting observation is that the planarity of Na4

and Na5 is broken as the atoms having more Na-Na bonds move farther from the surface.

Whether this is related to the experimentally observed buckling of Na overlayers remains an

open question.9,12

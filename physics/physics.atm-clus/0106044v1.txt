We study the interaction of strong femtosecond laser pulses with the C60 molecule employing time-
dependent density functional theory with the ionic background treated in a jellium approximation.
The laser intensities considered are below the threshold of strong fragmentation but too high for
perturbative treatments such as linear response because of ionization and higher order processes.
The nonlinear response of the model to excitations by pulses of frequencies up to 45 eV is presented.
With the help of Kohn-Sham orbital resolved dipole spectra the formation of collective resonances is
analyzed. In femtosecond laser pulses of 800 nm wavelength ionization is found to occur multiphoton-
like rather than via plasmon excitation.

I. INTRODUCTION

Intense laser atom interaction exhibits nonlinear phenomena such as above threshold ionization (ATI), high harmonic
generation (HHG), and nonsequential multiple ionization (NSI) (see [1] for recent reviews). While some of those
features are accessible in terms of a sequential “single active electron” (SAE) approach others are clear manifestations
of many electron eﬀects and correlation, e.g., NSI. The full ab initio solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (TDSE) for two active electrons interacting in their full dimensionality with the laser and their parent ion
is already at the limit of what is possible with modern computers [2]. Treating many electron systems in laser ﬁelds
thus needs further approximations. Density functional theory (DFT), extremely successful in electronic structure
calculations of many-electron systems ( see, e.g., [3]), has been extended to the time-dependent case (TDDFT) (see
[4], and, e.g., [5] for a review). Despite the fact that TDDFT still lacks an equally solid foundation compared to that
on which ground state DFT is built, it was successfully applied to metal clusters in laser pulses (see [6] for a review).
Problems mainly arise when observables have to be extracted which are not obvious functionals of the Kohn-Sham
orbitals or the total electron density, like in the study of NSI of atoms within TDDFT [7], or when the results are very
sensitive to the choice of the approximation to the unknown exchange-correlation potential. Compared to laser atom
interaction, in big molecules or clusters additional degrees of freedom are introduced: electronic degrees of freedom,
including collective eﬀects such as the formation of plasmons, vibrational degrees of freedom, or fragmentation. With
laser pulses of diﬀerent duration the equilibration of energy among the various channels can be probed. For C60 this
was nicely demonstrated in Ref. [8] where the photoelectron spectra in fs laser pulses exhibited ATI peaks, a signature
for direct multiphoton processes, which disappeared for longer pulses where collective eﬀects set in. Concerning the
ionization mechanism of C60 in fs laser pulses there is a discrepancy in the literature. While in the recent work of
Tchaplyguine et al. [9] from ion yield-curves vs. laser intensity direct multiphoton ionization was found to be the
responsible pathway for ionization of C60, in an earlier publication Hunsche et al. [10] claimed it is the excitation of
a giant resonance near 20 eV. Such a resonance at 20 eV in C60 was ﬁrst predicted theoretically by Bertsch et al. [11]
and conﬁrmed later in an experiment by Hertel et al. [12] using synchrotron radiation for single-photon ionization
measurements. When compared to metal clusters where collective resonances occur at a few eV a 20 eV giant resonance
is quite remarkable.

The nonlinear TDDFT treatment of C60 in a laser pulse is numerically rather demanding because one has to allow
for ionization which implies the use of a big numerical grid in order to represent the time-dependent Kohn-Sham (KS)
orbitals properly. It is thus impossible, at least with computers nowadays available, to achieve both a detailed account
of the soccer ball-like structure of C60 and an accurate propagation of freed electron density far away from the ion
and, possibly, back. Therefore we restrict ourselves to a jellium approach for the ionic background of the C60. Such a
jellium model was employed in [13] to study the photo absorption of atoms inside C60 within linear response theory.
It was found to share many of the relevant features with more demanding “ﬁrst principle” calculations (like, e.g., in
[11]) and experiment [12]. Jellium models were also successfully applied to metal clusters (see [14] for a review).

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we present our TDDFT jellium model of laser C60 interaction.
In Section III we present results: in III A we characterize our model concerning the dipole response and ionization
after excitation by pulses of diﬀerent frequencies. The formation of collective resonances is interpreted with the help
of Kohn-Sham orbital resolved dipoles vs. time and the corresponding spectra. In III B we examine the ionization
mechanism of our C60 model in 800 nm fs laser pulses. Section IV contains a brief summary and conclusion.

work. Moreover, we neglect spin-polarization eﬀects, i.e., n↑ = n↓ = n/2, n = 2
electrons. In the actual implementation less than N/2 KS orbitals need to be propagated because orbitals belonging to
the same subshell and having the same value
are still degenerated when the laser (treated in dipole approximation)
is on.

The dipole approximation is excellent for the laser frequencies under consideration. One might object that the
interior of the C60 could be screened, i.e., the laser pulse might not be able to penetrate the overdense electron cloud.
Indeed, in [10] the authors came to the conclusion that the laser cannot penetrate the C60. Their arguments were
based on the Debye length in a plasma of electron temperature 700 K. However, whether a laser pulse of wavelength
λi and frequency ωi is able or not able to penetrate a plasma layer of thickness δ is governed by the dimensionless
parameter ξ = π(ωp/ωi)2δ/λi [16] and not by the Debye length. Since ξ < 1 for all our parameters we will consider
in this paper the C60 is not a Faraday cage, and the dipole approximation is safe.

In our numerical code, the KS orbitals are expanded in spherical harmonics Y m

If the ground state has
a closed shell structure the eﬀective KS potential is spherical. Hence ℓ and m are “good” quantum numbers for

ℓ (ϕ, θ).

1-coupling only. However, orbitals with diﬀerent

the ground state conﬁguration. In a linearly polarized laser ﬁeld (in dipole approximation) the quantum numbers
m remain good, i.e., there is no m-coupling through the laser because the azimuthal symmetry is retained. VI (t)

KS wave functions are discretized in position space. Each time step, the eﬀective potential has to be calculated which
makes a TDKS solver signiﬁcantly more time-consuming than an ordinary TDSE code running a corresponding SAE
problem. The eﬀective potential Vee was expanded up to the dipole. Consequently, both the laser and Vee lead to
1-coupling only. We are conﬁdent that neglecting higher order multipoles of Vee does not aﬀect the validity of
an ℓ
our conclusions [17]. The actual propagation is performed in velocity gauge using an algorithm similar to the one for
the TDSE described by Muller in Ref. [18]. Probability density reaching the radial boundary of the numerical grid at
100 a.u. was removed by an imaginary potential. The eventually decreasing norm then can be interpreted as one

where A(t) is the vector potential and the A2-term has been transformed away (see, e.g., [19]). This potential leads
to the above mentioned ℓ

The ionic background is treated in a jellium approximation, i.e., the ions are thought of being smeared out over
a spherical shell with outer and inner radius Ro and Ri, respectively. The ionic charge density is constant for
Ro > r > Ri and zero otherwise. The radii Ro, Ri are centered around the known radius of the C60-fullerene,
(Ro + Ri)/2 = R = 6.7 a.u. In real C60 there are 60 π-electrons and 180 σ-electrons. Therefore the charge of the
jellium background should be 240 a.u. However, 240 KS particles do not yield a self-consistent closed shell-structure
for the ground state of our model. Since partially ﬁlled shells would spoil the spherical symmetry of the ground state
we take 250 electrons instead (see also [13]) which leads to a self-consistent closed shell ground state of the jellium
model. Thus, introducing

The parameters Ro, Ri, and v0 can be varied in order to obtain a jellium-C60 ground state which shares the relevant
features with ﬁrst-principle calculations of “real” C60. We used Ro = 8.1, Ri = 5.3, and v0 = 0.78. Some of the
ground state properties of the model are shown in Fig. 1. Because of the centrifugal barrier ℓ(ℓ + 1)/2r2 the total
potential is ℓ-dependent, and states with high ℓ are pushed outwards. The energy levels are 2(2ℓ + 1)-degenerated.
The 250 KS particles can be subdivided in 200 n = 1-states (the σ-electrons) occupying ℓ-values from 0 up to 9, and
50 n = 2-states (the π-electrons). The orbital densities are also shown. Each π-electron wavefunction has a node
near the jellium-shell radius R. The values of the single KS particle orbital eigenenergies are given in Table I. The
highest occupied state is the π state with ℓ = 4. From Koopman’s theorem we therefore expect an ionization energy
of I +
60 from that for neutral C60 we
obtain (on our numerical grid with a grid spacing ∆r = 0.3) I +
p = 0.279 (7.59 eV) which agrees reasonably well with
7.6 eV, [20]). In any case we expect for 800 nm laser light ﬁve photons being
the former value and experiment (
necessary for removing the outer electron. However, collective eﬀects might occur so that more photons are required.
In fact, there is an unresolved discrepancy in the literature about whether ionization of C60 in the fs-regime works
multiphoton-like [9] or through the excitation of a 20 eV giant resonance [10]. The results from our model concerning
this question will be presented in Section III B.

III. RESULTS

In this Section we present results obtained with our TDDFT code which propagates the KS orbitals in time, starting
from the ground state discussed in the foregoing Section. In the ﬁrst Subsection we study the dipole spectra and
ionization of our model after the interaction with light pulses of diﬀerent frequencies. In the second Subsection we
focus on the slope of the ion yield vs. laser intensity which gives the photon order of the ionization mechanism, i.e.,
it allows to distinguish between direct multiphoton ionization or excitation of a more energetic collective mode such
as the 20 eV resonance.

A. Ionization and plasmon excitation

Within linear response theory plasmon excitations are commonly inferred from the photo absorption cross section,
i.e., the imaginary part of the polarizability. Here we follow the diﬀerent route of nonlinear TDDFT which allows us
to distinguish between ionization, plasmon excitation, or both together, and also accounts for higher order processes
beyond single particle hole excitations.

We calculated the interaction of our jellium model with ten cycle sin2-shaped (with respect to the electric ﬁeld) laser
pulses in the frequency range from 6.8 up to 47.6 eV. The peak intensity was adjusted in such a way that intensity
times pulse duration (energy per unit area) was held constant, i.e., in atomic units ˆA2ωi = 1.8375
10−5 where ωi
is the incident laser frequency and ˆA is the vector potential amplitude. With such laser intensities the probability
to remove the ﬁrst electron remained below 10% for all frequencies. After the laser pulse was over we continued
the propagation of all KS orbitals to allow for delayed ionization and free oscillations. The total simulation time
corresponded to tend = 11.5 fs so that a real C60 which has been ionized at most to C+
60 has no time for fragmentation.

would emit radiation. In particular, by Fourier-transforming over a time interval after the laser pulse is over only
the eigenmodes remain. The result is presented in Fig. 2. The contour plot shows the logarithmically scaled dipole
strength vs. incident frequency ωi and emitted frequency ωe. Left to the contour plot the number of removed electrons

is plotted as a function of the incident frequency ωi. In all cases delayed ionization was negligible compared to the
electron density which was freed owing to the laser pulse.

All strongly excited plasmons lie near the diagonal ωi = ωe where the excitation was resonant. However, at
ωi = ωe = 20.5 eV relatively few plasmons were excited. It is exactly there where the ionization yield has a local
maximum (dashed line). Instead, the local minima in ionization at 17 and 24 eV coincide with two strong resonances
near the same values for ωe. This is not surprising: while in the former case laser energy is used to set electron density
free, in the latter case it is used to excite plasmons keeping the electron density trapped. From the photo absorption
cross section in linear response theory one can hardly distinguish between both cases. For ωi = 30 eV one observes
both, strong ionization and eﬃcient plasmon excitation. For even higher ωi ionization drops and the jellium system
does not provide any collective modes > 40 eV.

The linear response result for the photo absorption cross section presented in [13] for a similar jellium model
shows two pronounced peaks (although at somewhat lower energies) which resemble our peaks at ωe = 17 and 24 eV.
Such peaks are commonly interpreted as surface plasmons, so-called Mie-resonances [21]. Such Mie-plasmons have
frequencies

where ωp is the bulk plasma frequency and ℓ is the index of a multipole expansion. For a dipolar Mie-plasmon we
simply have ωMie = ωp/√3. For our model we expect the Mie-resonance at 21.9 eV. Usually the peaks are found
to be red-shifted which is attributed to the spill-out eﬀect when the electron density oscillates beyond the jellium
background into the vacuum. Therefore one might think about the peak at 17 eV in terms of a surface plasmon. We
checked this by looking at movies of the oscillating total electron density (minus the ground state electron density).
Not surprisingly, we observed at a certain time instant excess electron density at z = +Ra, missing electron density
at z = +Ri, excess at z =
Ra while one half period later it is the other
way round. However, this dipole-like motion is qualitatively the same for all other frequencies as well. “Real space
movies” are therefore not very suited for an understanding of the positions of those plasmon peaks.

On the other hand, the position of all the plasmon peaks in Fig. 2 can be understood in terms of transitions between
the KS energy levels of Table I. To illustrate this we present KS orbital-resolved dipoles (KSORD) vs. time and the
corresponding spectrum (KSORD-spectrum). For ωi = 0.9 a.u. (the 24 eV-peak) the result is given in Fig. 3. From the
KSORD we infer how each KS orbital, populated by either two particles (m = 0) or four particles (
> 0), oscillates

|
after the laser pulse is over. The diﬀerent ℓ-shells can be easily distinguished. The amplitude of the total dipole is
relatively small because the individual KS orbital dipoles in part interfere destructively. In general the σ electrons
(orbital numbers 0–54) tend to oscillate 180◦ out of phase with respect to the π electrons (55–69) of the same (initial)
ℓ. The spectrum of the KSORD is presented at the right-hand-side of Fig. 3. The low frequency lines in the range

0–5 eV stem from transitions of the type ℓ

(n = 2)(ℓ + 1) or

branches). The π-electrons also make transitions between 5 and 15 eV. Those peaks can be stronger for lower ωi
and are caused by transitions (n = 2)ℓ

corresponds to a transition of the type (n = 1)

1-transitions are not possible for them. Indeed, the left branch of the parabola-like
at that frequency is that ℓ
structure for the σ-electrons (related to transitions where the ℓ quantum number decreases by one) shows gaps for
the ℓ =
orbitals whereas for the π electrons it is the right branch where the corresponding lines are missing. The
spectrum of the total dipole is shown above the contour plot. Although individual KS orbitals strongly oscillate with
frequencies between 21 and 23 eV only the line at 24.5 eV survives due to destructive interference of the former and
constructive interference of the latter. In fact, in the KSORD-spectrum one sees that all KS orbitals have a relatively
strong component of the 24.5 eV mode. This is nothing else than the manifestation of a giant resonance in terms
of single KS particle transitions. It occurs at frequencies which correspond to single KS particle transitions of type
nℓ
1) involving σ and π-orbitals with highest occupied ℓ in the ground state conﬁguration. Those orbitals
have the highest degree of degeneracy which is favorable for collective behavior. Since the density of high-ℓ states
is pushed outwards due to the centrifugal barrier it makes indeed sense to call those collective excitations surface
(or Mie) plasmons. Note that the fact that in our KSORD spectrum also (initially) low-ℓ orbitals emit radiation
corresponding to higher-ℓ transitions implies higher order processes beyond single particle hole excitations.

As an example for a higher incident frequency (ωi = 1.1) we present the KSORD in Fig. 4. All orbitals oscillate
with the same frequencies around 30 eV (note the two lighter vertical stripes at the same position for nearly all the
orbitals). This is a clear indication for a nonlinear process because more than a single transition from the ground
state conﬁguration to an excited state is required to meet those particular frequencies at 31.9 eV and 29.5 eV. Those
(n = 1)(ℓ + 1) transition for ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, respectively. The amplitude of
energies correspond to the (n = 3)ℓ
the total dipole is higher than those of the individual KS orbital dipoles, indicating that the 30 eV emission is due
to constructive interference of many KS orbital oscillations while, again, the low frequency modes (e.g., the one of
the ℓ = 7 σ-orbital at 4.6 eV) interfere away. One might argue that this is the formation of a bulk plasmon although
the bulk in our model is only a spherical shell of thickness 2.8 atomic units. Assuming a homogenous electron density
over the shell one ﬁnds a plasma frequency ωp = 38 eV. A red-shift of 10–20% is usually attributed to spill-out eﬀects
and the non-uniform electron density.

60 yield vs. laser intensity for λ = 800 nm

After studying the plasmon response at relatively high energies we now turn to the interaction of C60 with laser
light of 800 nm wavelength. We simulated the interaction of our C60 jellium model with a ten cycle 800 nm sin2-shaped
laser pulses (corresponding to 26 fs pulse duration). In Fig. 5 the removed electron density Nrem after the pulse vs.
1 this is equivalent to the single ionization
the peak intensity of the pulse is presented. In the regime where Nrem ≪
probability. In the case of perturbative oﬀ-resonant multiphoton ionization of atoms it is well-known (see, e.g., [19])
I n where n is the number of photons needed to reach the continuum from the
that the ionization probability is
initial state. From Section II we know that in our jellium model the ﬁrst ionization potential is I +
p = 0.279, and
thus we expect n = 5 photons necessary for ionization if C60 behaves multiphoton-like. As is evident from Fig. 5 this
is the case, in agreement with an experiment performed using a Ti Sapphire laser (λ = 800 nm, 30 to 120 fs pulse
duration) [9]. There, from the C2+
60 yield-slope, also the second electron was found to behave multiphoton-like with
n = 8. Those ﬁndings are in contrast with earlier experimental results in [10] (same wavelength and pulse durations)
where excitation of the 20 eV Mie-resonance, corresponding to n = 13 photons, was concluded to be the dominant
ionization mechanism. The n = 13 slope is depicted in Fig. 5 in the upper left corner and is much too steep to ﬁt with
our numerical result. This appears reasonable because the incident laser frequency 1.6 eV lies energetically far below

∼

5

the Mie-resonance so that an eﬃcient excitation of the latter is unlikely. The experimental fragmentation onset and
the C60 saturation intensity as observed in [9] is also indicated in Fig. 5.

In Fig. 6 we present dipoles and the corresponding spectra for two particular laser intensities. For the higher
intensity [plots (c) and (d)] the electron density continues oscillating quite strongly after the pulse but with little
eﬀect on ionization. In the spectra (b) and (d) the black curve was calculated from Fourier-transforming the dipole
with respect to the entire time interval shown in the plots above. Therefore lines corresponding to the laser harmonics
can be observed in those spectra. Fourier-transforming only over the time after the pulse leads to the gray curves.
In the low intensity case (b) the dominant line is around 3 eV, corresponding to the transition of the outermost
π-electron from ℓ = 4 to ℓ = 5. This transition is nearly resonant with two laser photons. In the high intensity case
the electron density continues oscillating with the laser frequency even after the pulse. The next more energetic peaks
are, again, the ℓ = 4
10 transition of a σ-electron at 5.5 eV. The
next line corresponds to the ionization energy 7.5 eV. For both intensities excitations around 20 eV are several orders
of magnitude weaker and can therefore not play any role in the ionization process of our C60 model at that laser
wavelength.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we presented a nonlinear time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)-treatment of a C60
jellium model in intense laser pulses. The Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals were expanded in spherical harmonics and
discretized in radial direction on a suﬃciently big numerical grid on which they were propagated in time. By this
method all bound states and the continuum can be properly represented, allowing for an accurate description of
ionization and higher order transitions, not included in linear response theory (sometimes also called TDDFT).

For short exciting pulses with frequencies between 7 and 48 eV we studied both ionization and the power spectra,
calculated from the nonlinear dipole response after the pulse had passed by. We observed that when the incident
frequency matched with two resonant peaks of the dipole spectrum at 17 and 24 eV, respectively, ionization dropped.
Instead, an incident frequency in between (
20.5 eV) led to a maximum ion yield. Another maximum was found at
frequencies around 31 eV where strong ionization and plasmon excitation occur together. For even higher incident
photon energies > 37 eV ionization decreased because energy transfer to the C60 became ineﬃcient.

We characterized in detail the Kohn-Sham orbital resolved dipole (KSORD) response. The corresponding spectra
can be understood in terms of transitions between the unperturbed KS orbital energy levels connected to the ground
state. In the KSORD spectra the formation of, e.g., the 24 eV Mie-resonance (i.e., surface plasmon) appeared as the
destructive interference of single KS orbital oscillations with low frequency, and constructive interference of the higher
frequency oscillation. Those Mie-plasmons form at frequencies of the KSORD spectrum which stem from single KS
particle transitions of type nℓ
1) involving the σ and π orbitals with highest occupied ℓ (in the ground
state conﬁguration). This is because these ground state orbitals have the highest degree of degeneracy which supports
collective behavior.

For 800 nm fs laser pulses we observed direct multiphoton ionization rather than ionization via excitation of a
Mie-resonance. This result agrees with recent experimental ﬁndings in [9]. Although it disagrees with earlier results
in [10] we are quite conﬁdent that our model also works well in this respect because the multiphoton character for
optical (or near optical) frequencies is well-known for metal clusters (see, e.g., [6], and references therein), and it is
hard to believe that it should be diﬀerent for C60 where the collective resonances are even more energetic.

The TDDFT jellium model oﬀers one of the very few feasible approaches for theoretical investigations concerning
the interaction of intense laser light with complex systems where many electron-eﬀects, bound-free transitions, and
rescattering might be important. Preliminary results for “above threshold ionization” (ATI) of C60 (as in the experi-
ment [8]) were also obtained within this model [22]. Simulating ATI is always much more demanding than studying
the dipole response and ionization only since one has to trace the free electron motion in the continuum as well as
rescattering events with very high accuracy over several laser cycles of optical frequency.

TABLE I. The ground state single KS particle orbital energies as obtained on our numerical grid used for propagation with
grid spacing ∆r = 0.3. The σ-electrons occupy ℓ-values up to 9, the π-electrons up to 4. Orbital energies of unoccupied levels
are written italic. The orbitals are enumerated for the sake of easy reference. For each ℓ-shell ℓ + 1 KS orbitals to account for
all the possible |m| (numbered from lowest to highest) are needed.

Ground state poperties of the jellium C60-model. (a) The total potential V (r) + U [n(r)] + Vxc[n(r)] depends on the
angular quantum number ℓ (through the centrifugal barrier). For n = 1 (σ-electrons) orbitals from ℓ = 0 up to ℓ = 9
are occupied in the ground state situation, for n = 2 (π-electrons) orbitals from ℓ = 0 to ℓ = 4 are occupied. The
potential for the empty ℓ = 10 orbitals is drawn dashed. The radial shape of the total ground state density n(r) is
also plotted. (b) The single KS particle energy levels corresponding to the potentials in (a). σ-states are drawn solid
while π-states are plotted dashed. The degeneracy is 2(2ℓ + 1). (c) The orbital densities n(σ,π)
. The sum of those is
n(r)/4π.

Right-hand-side: contour plot of the Fourier-transformed dipole d(t) after ten cycle pulses of frequency ωi. The
dipole strength vs. incident frequency ωi and emitted frequency ωe is logarithmically scaled (cf. color bar ranging
from 10−30 to 10−7, in arbitrary units). Left-hand-side: number of removed electrons. The horizontal solid (dashed)
lines (line) indicate frequencies ωi where ionization was relatively low (high) and plasmon excitation was eﬃcient
(ineﬃcient).

KS orbital resolved dipoles (KSORD, left) and the corresponding spectrum (right) after a laser pulse with frequency
ωi = 0.9. The KS orbitals are enumerated according Table I. The total dipole and the corresponding spectrum (linearly
scaled) are given also. See text for a detailed discussion.

Same as in Fig. 3 but for ωi = 1.1. See text for a detailed discussion.

Removal of the ﬁrst electron vs. the peak intensity of a ten cycle 800 nm sin2-pulse (solid curve). A multiphoton-like
I n with n = 5 is evident. Instead, n = 13 photons would be necessary to excite the 20 eV Mie-resonance.
60 saturation intensity from [9] are also indicated (vertical lines).

for having a strong eﬀect on ionization.

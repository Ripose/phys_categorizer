The melting-like transitions of Na8 and Na20 are investigated by extensive ab initio constant energy
molecular dynamics simulations, using a variant of the Car-Parrinello method which employs an
explicit electronic kinetic energy functional of the density, thus avoiding the use of one-particle
orbitals. Several melting indicators are evaluated in order to determine the nature of the diﬀerent
transitions, and comparison with other theoretical calculations is made. Both Na8 and Na20 melt
over a wide range of temperature. For Na8, a ﬁrst transition is observed at ∼ 110 K, between
a rigid phase and a phase involving isomerization between the diﬀerent permutational isomers of
the ground state structure. The “liquid” phase is completely established at ∼ 220 K. For Na20,
three successive transitions are observed: the ﬁrst phase transition, at ∼ 110 K, is associated with
isomerization transitions between those permutational isomers of the ground state structure which
are obtained by interchanging the positions of the surface atoms; the second, at ∼ 150 K, involves
a structural transition from the ground state isomer to a new set of isomers and amounts to surface
melting; the last transition, at ∼ 220 K, completes the melting of the cluster.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recent experimental advances have made possible the
study of the melting phenomenon in metal clusters.
Martin1 found the melting temperatures Tm of sodium
clusters by observing the disappearance of the atomic
shell structure with increasing temperature, and deter-
mined the dependence of Tm on cluster size. More re-
cently, Haberland and coworkers2 determined the heat
capacity and melting temperature of free sodium clus-
ters containing from 70 to 200 atoms by studying the
temperature dependence of the photofragmentation mass
spectrum.

For many years, computer simulations have been the
only guide to an understanding of melting-like transitions
in small ﬁnite systems. Molecular dynamics (MD) calcu-
lations based on phenomenological potentials have been
used to study the solid-like to liquid-like phase transi-
tions in rare gas,3 alkali halide,4,5 and metal6–9 clusters.
The uniﬁcation of density functional theory (DFT) and
molecular dynamics formulated by Car and Parrinello10
allows for an explicit treatment of the electronic de-
grees of freedom. Such ab initio molecular dynamics
calculations have been performed by R¨othlisberger and
Andreoni11 for Nan (n=2–20) microclusters at several
temperatures, and very recently, Rytk¨onen et al.12 have
presented results for the melting of Na40. These stud-
ies make use of the Kohn-Sham (KS) version of DFT,13
but large computational savings can be obtained if an
orbital-free method, based solely in the electronic den-
sity n(~r), can be used instead. Madden and coworkers14
have demonstrated the value of orbital-free methods for
the study of bulk metallic systems. Shah et al.15 and
Govind et al.16 have applied the approach to study the
structures of small metal and covalent clusters. Blaise

1

et al.17 have performed orbital-free calculations of some
static and dynamic properties of sodium clusters with
sizes up to 274 atoms, and Vichare and Kanhere18 have
studied the melting of Al13. In this paper we describe the
study of solid-like to liquid-like phase transitions of Na8
and Na20 microclusters using constant energy orbital free
molecular dynamics simulations.

In the next section we present the theoretical details of
the method. The results are presented and discussed in
section III. Section IV summarizes the main conclusions
from this study.

II. THEORY

A. Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics with
Orbital-Free Energy Density Functionals

The orbital-free molecular dynamics method is a Car-
Parrinello total energy scheme which uses an explicit
kinetic-energy functional of the electron density, and has
the valence electron density as the dynamic variable, as
opposed to the Kohn-Sham single particle wavefunctions.
Now we describe the main features of the energy func-
tional and the calculational scheme.

The ground state energy is a functional of the valence
electron density distribution n(~r), and a function of the
ion positions ~Rn (n = 1, 2, . . . N ), with the following form
(Hartree atomic units will be used through the paper):

E[n, ~R] = Ts[n] +

where the diﬀerent terms are: the kinetic energy func-
tional for a noninteracting inhomogeneous electron gas,
the classical electron-electron interaction energy, the in-
teraction energy between the valence electron distribu-
tion and the external potential provided by the instan-
taneous ionic conﬁguration, the exchange-correlation en-
ergy functional, and the classical Coulomb repulsion be-
tween positive ions.

For a given set of ion positions { ~R}, that is for a given
external potential Vext, the ground state is obtained from
the variational principle:

We have found it convenient to work in terms of a

single eﬀective orbital ψ(~r) rather than n(~r), where

and to vary ψ rather than n.14–17 This has the advantage
of maintaining n nonnegative if ψ is real. The cluster of
interest is placed in a unit cell of a superlattice of volume
Ω, and the set of plane waves periodic in the superlattice
is used to represent ψ as follows:

where ~G is a reciprocal lattice vector of the superlattice.

cients C ~G as generalized coordinates of a set of ﬁctitious
classical particles each of mass m, and write down the
Lagrangian for the whole system of electrons and ions as

The “molecular dynamics” of the electrons alone, hold-
R
ing the ions ﬁxed, can be used to determine the electronic
ground state.
If the electron MD run is started from
some arbitrary initial state (i.e. a set of coeﬃcients C ~G),
and the electron velocities are scaled down repeatedly,
or equivalently the electron temperature is gradually re-
duced, the system cools down or anneals into its ground
state. Once the electrons are in their ground state for
a particular conﬁguration of the ions, and the ions and
electrons are allowed to move according to the full set of
equations (11–12), then for a judicious choice of ﬁctitious
electron mass the electrons tend to stay in their ground
state on the Born-Oppenheimer surface as the ions move.
This means that the Hellmann-Feynmann theorem can
be used to calculate the forces on the ions, which is a
great simpliﬁcation. This MD of the system of electrons
and ions can be used to determine the equilibrium ar-
rangement of the ions by simulated annealing,15,16 and
to study dynamical properties, which is the goal of this
paper.

Three key approximations in the energy functional in-
volve T[n], EXC[n], and the electron-ion interaction. The
electronic kinetic energy functional used in this work cor-
responds to the gradient expansion around the homoge-
neous limit through second order,19

taking some account of inhomogeneities in the electron

corresponds to the limit of a slowly varying n(~r) and has a
number of desirable properties.20–22 The local density ap-
proximation (LDA) is used for the exchange-correlation

i v(~r− ~Ri), where we
electron-ion interaction, Vext(~r) =
take v to be the local pseudopotential of Fiolhais et al.,25
which reproduces very well the properties of bulk sodium
and has shown good transferability to sodium clusters.26
Although some recent progress has been made for in-
cluding the eﬀects of nonlocality in the pseudopotential
in orbital free schemes,27 these eﬀects are expected to be
small for sodium. The ion-ion interactions are treated
using the usual Ewald method.28

P

The force on an ion at ~Ri is given by ~Fi = −δE/δ ~Ri,
but, if the electrons are in their ground state for the
particular conﬁguration of ions { ~R}, so that n(~r) is the
ground state electron density, then

(18)

because E is stationary with respect to n at the ground
state (this is the Hellman-Feynman theorem). Only the
explicit dependence of E on the ion positions enters the
force so that only the electron-ion and Madelung energies
contribute. If (18) is to be used to calculate the forces
care must be taken to keep the electrons in the ground
state for the current ion conﬁguration, because if δn(~r)
is the deviation of the electron density from the current
ground state, the error in the “Hellman-Feynman” force
is ﬁrst order in δn.

The explicit functional of the density we have used
for the electronic energy is greatly superior in computa-
tional speed and in memory requirements to the conven-
tional Kohn-Sham orbital based approach, allowing the
treatment of larger systems for longer simulation times.
Although the orbital-free approach is, for the moment,
limited to local pseudopotentials this is not a serious re-
striction for sodium, and the main diﬀerence between the
orbital-free and full KS approaches is the approximate
treatment of the independent particle kinetic energy in
the former. Ts[n] is computed exactly in the full KS ap-
proach, which was the motivation for its development,
whereas the orbital-free approach draws on approximate
density functionals based on a few known limiting cases.
Our choice (13) for Ts[n] with λ = 1
9 is appropriate for
slowly varying density, Ts[n] = T W [n] is thought to be
appropriate in the limit of rapidly varying density, lin-
ear response theory gives Ts[n] when the variations in
electron density about some reference density are small,
and some functionals attempt to combine these diﬀerent
limits.14 Our functional would seem to be appropriate for
the smooth pseudoelectron density of a Na cluster, but
since little is known about the range of validity of the var-
ious functionals, we have performed test calculations on
some simple Na systems and compared the results with
those of other approaches.

Table I presents results for Na-Na equilibrium bond
lengths and binding energy per atom calculated within
three diﬀerent approximations for the Na dimer and a
Na6 cluster. All the calculations use the LDA for ex-
change and correlation, but diﬀer in their treatment of
the electron-ion interaction and the electron kinetic en-
ergy. The results of Kohn-Sham all-electron calculations
are given along with those of Kohn-Sham calculations
which use the same local pseudopotential that we have
used, and comparison of these results provides a test of
the pseudopotential. We see that the pseudopotential
overestimates the bond lengths by a few percent but the
agreement is quite satisfactory, and the increased bond
length in Na6 over that in the dimer is reproduced. The
binding energies are also in good agreement. The third
set of calculations uses the functional on which our work
is based, with the same pseudopotential but the approx-
imate explicit kinetic energy functional described earlier.
The comparison of the second and third sets of results
provides a test of the Ts[n] which we use. The approxi-
mate Ts[n] overestimates the bond length for the dimer
but the results for the Na6 bond length are in very good
agreement. The binding energies are overestimated but
the increased binding in Na6 is preserved. These tests
and other results described later on bulk Na dynamics
suggests that our energy functional performs adequately,
particularly in view of the increased computational eﬃ-
ciency.

The calculations for Na8 and Na20 have been per-
formed using a cubic supercell of edge 63.58 a.u. with
a 64 × 64 × 64 mesh. The energy cut-oﬀ used in the
plane wave expansion (7) of ψ was 10 Rydbergs. The
equations of motion (11–12) were integrated using the
Verlet algorithm29 for both the electrons and the ions
with a time step ranging from ∆t = 1 × 10−15 sec. for
the simulations performed at the lowest temperatures,
to ∆t = 0.85 × 10−15 sec.
for those performed at the
highest ones. The ﬁctitious electron mass ranged from
1.15 × 108 for the shorter time steps, to 1.75 × 108 for
the longest. These choices resulted in a conservation of
the total energy better than 0.1 %. The ﬁrst step in the
simulation was the determination of the low temperature
ground state structures (GS) of Na8 and Na20 using the
dynamical simulated annealing10 by heating the clusters
to 600 K and then slowly cooling them. Once the GS
had been found, several molecular dynamics simulation
runs at diﬀerent energies were performed in order to ob-
tain the caloric curve. The initial relative positions of
the atoms in the cluster for the ﬁrst run were taken by
slightly deforming the equilibrium geometry. The ﬁnal
conﬁguration of each run served as the starting geom-
etry for the next run at a diﬀerent energy. The initial
velocities for every new run were obtained by scaling the
ﬁnal velocities of the preceding run. The total simulation
times were 8 ps for the lowest temperatures for which the
clusters are clearly rigid (solid-like) (T < 60 K), and 20–
22 ps for temperatures larger than 60 K. The ﬁrst 2 ps of
each run were not included in the diﬀerent time averages.

B. Analysis of the Molecular Dynamics

In order to characterize the thermal behavior of the
clusters as a function of increasing internal energy, and
the solid-like to liquid-like transitions, we monitor both
global quantities that are calculated from time averages
over a whole trajectory at a given energy, and time de-
pendent quantities that are calculated from averages over
well separated time origins along a single trajectory.

First, we deﬁne the “internal temperature” T of the

cluster as3,30

T =

2
(3N − 6)kB

< Ekin >t,

(19)

where kB is the Boltzman constant, Ekin is the ionic ki-
netic energy, and <>t represents the time average over
a whole trajectory. All the global quantities described
below will be plotted as functions of this internal tem-
perature.

The degree of mobility of atoms - a sort of index of
rigidity of the cluster - can be characterized by the rel-
ative root-mean-square (rms) bond length ﬂuctuation δ,
deﬁned by3,30

δ =

N (N − 1) Xi>j

(< R2

ij >t − < Rij >2
< Rij >t

t )1/2

,

(20)

where Rij =| ~Ri − ~Rj |. This quantity changes abruptly
at isomerization or melting transitions, and for the bulk,
a sharp increase in δ gives the Lindemann criterion for
melting.

As another indicator of the melting-like transition we

calculate the speciﬁc heat deﬁned by3,30

Cv = [N − N (1 −

3N − 6

) < Ekin >t< E

−1

−1.

(21)

This magnitude is related to the ﬂuctuations in the ionic
kinetic energy, and has peaks (corresponding to slope
changes in the caloric curve) associated to some phase
transitions.

The mean square displacement, R(t), deﬁned by

R(t) =

N

Xj=1

Xi=1

[~ri(t0j + t) − ~ri(t0j )]2,

(22)

where nt is the number of time origins (t0j ) considered
along a trajectory, is a time-dependent quantity that also
serves as a measure of the rigidity of the cluster.3 The
slope of R(t) for large t is proportional to the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient, so that R(t) independent of time indicates
a solid-like cluster with the constituent atoms vibrating
about their equilibrium positions, whereas when diﬀusive
motion of the atoms starts, the slope of R(t) becomes
positive. We shall see in the next section that it is useful
to separate the atoms of Na20 into two subsets of Nc=2
“core” and Ns=18 “surface” atoms. We can then de-
ﬁne partial R(t)’s, restricted to core (Rc(t)) and surface
(Rs(t)) atoms, respectively, and the diﬀerences between

these will be indicators of diﬀerent degrees of rigidity in
the two groups of atoms for a given internal cluster tem-
perature.

Recently,31 the “atomic equivalence indexes”

σi(t) =

| ~ri(t) − ~rj (t) |,

(23)

Xj

which contain very detailed structural information, have
been introduced. The degeneracies in σi(t) are due to
the speciﬁc symmetry of the isomer under consideration,
and the variations in the time evolution of σi(t) allow for
a detailed examination of the melting mechanism.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Na8

It

1(a).

is a dodecahedron (D2d

The calculated GS structure of Na8 is shown in
Fig.
symme-
try), a result which is in agreement with the KS-
LDA calculations.11,32,33 The stellated tetrahedron (Td
symmetry) is the GS structure in all-electron SCF-CI
calculations,34,35 although the energy diﬀerence between
both isomers is very small indeed. It is noteworthy that
our orbital-free-LDA calculations lead to the same struc-
ture as the KS-LDA.

Figure 2 shows the results for the calculated global
quantities Cv (ﬁg. 2(a)) and δ (ﬁg. 2(b)) as functions
of internal cluster temperature, and the time evolution
of the mean square displacement, R(t), for two represen-
tative temperatures (ﬁg. 2(c)). The speciﬁc heat shows
a peak centered at a temperature Tm1 ≈ 110 K, which
correlates with the temperature region in which δ expe-
riences an almost stepwise increase, and marks the onset
of the melting transition. This is followed by a steady
increase of δ(T), until a levelling oﬀ occurs at Tm2 ≈ 220
K, which indicates that the liquid state is fully devel-
oped. The melting transition of Na8 from a rigid form,
in which the motion of the atoms is restricted to oscil-
lations about the equilibrium conﬁguration, to a “ﬂuid”
form characterized by uncorrelated motion of the atoms,
is spread over a range of temperatures T=Tm1-Tm2. Fig.
2(c) shows that for a temperature T=34 K, R(t) has zero
slope at long times, reﬂecting the oscillatory motion of
the atoms. At T=111 K the diﬀusive motion of the atoms
in the cluster begins resulting in a positive slope; that
slope increasing with temperature.
The quantities shown in Fig.

2 indicate that Na8
undergoes a melting-like transition in the temperature
range 110-220 K. In order to get a better understand-
ing of the melting behavior of Na8, the short-time aver-
ages of the “atomic equivalence indexes”, < σi(t) >sta,
have been calculated and the cluster evolution during
the trajectories has been followed visually using com-
puter graphics. The < σi(t) >sta curves are presented
in Fig. 3 for two representative values of T. At the low-
est temperature T=34 K (ﬁg. 3(a)) there are two distinct
groups of nearly equivalent atoms in the D2d GS struc-
ture: four atoms with coordination 4, and four with co-
ordination 5. The curve crossings within the same group

4

of nearly equivalent atoms reveal the oscillations of the
atoms around their equilibrium positions, but there are
no crossings of curves corresponding to diﬀerent groups.
At a higher temperature T=78 K, still lower than Tm1,
the oscillations of the atoms around their equilibrium po-
sitions are of larger amplitude, but the two types of atoms
are still distinct. At T=111 K (ﬁg. 3b), which marks the
beginning of the step in δ, interchanges between atoms
with diﬀerent coordination begins, and these become pro-
gressively numerous at higher temperatures, until the
merging of the atomic equivalence indexes into a single
group indicates that the liquid phase is fully developed.
The movies show that the onset of melting in Na8 is as-
sociated with isomerization transitions between the dif-
ferent permutational isomers of the D2d GS structure.
These isomerization transitions come with signiﬁcant dis-
tortions of the cluster from the GS geometry, which be-
come progressively more signiﬁcant with increasing tem-
perature, until at T≈ 220 K and higher temperatures
the ground state isomer is seen only occasionally in the
movies. Snapshots of the trajectories at these tempera-
tures show that the cluster sometimes adopts elongated
conﬁgurations with Na or Na2 subunits joined to the clus-
ter by a single bond. While we have not observed evap-
oration of fragments at this temperature (at least within
20 picoseconds), the trajectories suggest that Na or Na2
subunits may evaporate at higher temperatures from the
ends of a “cigar-like” cluster.

Detailed simulations of the melting-like transition of
Na8 have been performed by Bulgac and Kusnezov (BK)6
using constant-temperature molecular dynamics simu-
lations with a phenomenological interatomic potential,
and by Poteau, Spiegelmann and Labastie (PSL)8 us-
ing Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a tight-binding
hamiltonian to describe the electronic system. Aside
from the diﬀerences between MC and MD methods, the
main diﬀerence between those calculations and our work
is the interatomic potential. The phenomenological in-
teratomic potential employed by BK has free parame-
ters that were adjusted to properties of bulk sodium, and
while the tight-binding calculations of PSL deal explic-
itly with the electronic system, some overlap integrals
were ﬁtted to ab initio results for the sodium dimer and
tetramer. Since we consider the electronic degrees of
freedom explicitly and ﬁnd the forces on ions through
the Hellman-Feynman theorem, the present calculations
should be considered an important advance over empir-
ical or semiempirical methods. BK predict a transition
at a temperature of about 100 K from a solid-like to a
glassy phase of the cluster in which the atoms stay close
to their equilibrium positions for relatively long periods
and occasionally two atoms interchange their positions.
PSL predict the melting-like transition to occur at ∼ 200
K. BK also predict a second transition from glass to liq-
uid at a temperature of 900 K which is much higher than
the bulk melting temperature (Tbulk
m =371 K). A transi-
tion to a liquid phase at temperatures larger than Tbulk
m is
unexpected in ﬁnite-size systems. The transition at 900
K could be an artifact of the model used by BK which
included a linear restoring force in order to prevent evap-
oration of atoms from the cluster; perhaps the transition

is associated with a liquid phase under external pressure.
We certainly do not expect to ﬁnd a second transition at
such high temperatures where evaporation must be im-
portant. However, the “solid-to-glassy” transition of BK
is similar to the picture we have found at the onset of
melting at temperatures of ∼ 110-130 K in which δ in-
creases rapidly, where the atoms remain in their equilib-
rium positions for relatively long periods, only swapping
positions from time to time with a frequency which in-
creases with temperature. For temperatures above 220K
where the value of δ increases smoothly with T, the atoms
are very mobile and the cluster can be considered liquid.
R¨othlisberger and Andreoni (RA)11 have performed
some ﬁnite temperature simulations for Na8 using the ab
initio Car-Parrinello MD method. They have used pseu-
dopotentials for the electron-ion interaction and the LDA
for the exchange-correlation energy functional. Thus,
the main diﬀerence between the present calculations and
those of RA is our use of an approximate electronic
kinetic-energy functional. They reported from a sim-
ulation at T=240 K, that the calculated value of δ is
still less than 0.1, the value which indicates the onset of
melting according to the Lindeman criterion. There is
no doubt that a full KS method based on one-particle
orbitals is more accurate than our approximate density-
based method, but in our view the apparently contradic-
tory results can be reconciled. The total simulation time
of RA for Na8 was t=6 ps, corresponding to about ∼
10 vibrational periods for sodium.1 Our calculated value
of δ at T=230 K, if we average over the ﬁrst 6 ps of the
simulation is 0.098, in agreement with the full KS results.
Due to the nature of the melting transition in Na8, in-
volving a repeated swapping of the atom positions, 6 ps
may not be long enough to obtain a converged value for
δ. In fact, we chose the total simulation time of t=20 ps
after recognizing that preliminary simulations performed
with t=8 ps did not yield a converged result for δ. With
t=20 ps, further increases only lead to minor changes in
δ, at least when the cluster is clearly liquid-like. Never-
theless, we can not guarantee that fully converged values
of δ have been obtained in the transition region.

B. Na20

The GS structure of Na20 is a single-capped double
icosahedron (ﬁg. 1(b)). This result is again in good
agreement with the KS-LDA calculations of RA,11 who
ﬁnd this structure as an isomer essentially degenerate
with their GS structure. The variation of the speciﬁc
heat with temperature, which is shown in ﬁg. 4(a), dis-
plays two clear maxima around 110 K and 170 K. The
relative rms bond length ﬂuctuation is given in ﬁg. 4(b).
For small temperatures the curve δ(T ) has a small pos-
itive slope reﬂecting the thermal expansion of the solid-
like cluster, but at higher temperatures, there are three
abrupt increases at Tm1 ≈ 110K, Tm2 ≈ 150K, and
Tm3 ≈ 220K, indicating that the melting of Na20 oc-
curs in diﬀerent stages over a wide range of tempera-
tures, Tm1–Tm3. The two peaks in the speciﬁc heat are
in rough correspondence with the two ﬁrst steps in δ(T).

5

The last step in δ does not seem to be associated with any
pronounced feature in the speciﬁc heat. The mean square
displacement of the particles in the cluster, as a function
of time, is plotted in Fig. 4(c) for two diﬀerent tem-
peratures. The curve corresponding to T=55 K shows a
clear leveling oﬀ after a small initial rise, reﬂecting the
solid-like nature of the cluster at that temperature. For
T = 109 K and higher temperatures, R(t) shows a lin-
ear increase implying a ﬁnite diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the
emergence of liquid-like properties.

In order to investigate the nature of the transitions we
divide the 20 atoms of the cluster into two subsets: the
two internal “core” atoms of the calculated GS structure
of Na20, and the 18 peripheral “surface” atoms. The par-
tial Rc(t) and Rs(t) for a temperature at which the ﬁrst
step in δ begins are shown in ﬁg. 5. The Rs(t) curve
shows the typical diﬀusive behavior of liquid-like phases,
whereas Rc(t), after the initial rise, oscillates with an av-
erage slope near zero. Diﬀerences in the mobility of the
surface and core atoms are clearly indicated, the surface
atoms undergoing diﬀusive motion at a lower tempera-
ture (Tm1 ≈ 110 K) than the core atoms. Snapshots at
regular time intervals for the runs between T=Tm1 and
T=Tm2, show directly that the two central atoms oscil-
late around their initial positions, while surface atoms
interchange their positions in the cluster without de-
stroying the double-icosahedron symmetry. The picture
is quite similar to the onset of melting in Na8. The
swapping of surface atom positions causes signiﬁcant dis-
tortions of the double-icosahedron geometry, but after
each interchange the cluster returns to the GS structure.
Therefore, we identify the transition at Tm1 ≈ 110 K as
an isomerization-like transition in which the cluster be-
gins to visit those permutational isomers of the Na20 GS
structure which involve the interchange of positions be-
tween surface atoms. In our view, this ﬂuctuating phase
of Na20 can not be clearly associated with surface melt-
ing, because the double-icosahedral symmetry persists
and the surface disorder is not complete.

The next stage in the development of liquid-like prop-
erties is seen in snapshots from the runs performed at
temperatures between Tm2 and Tm3 . The second transi-
tion involves the motion of one of the central atoms out
to a peripheral position, the double-icosahedral symme-
try is lost, and most of the snapshots show a structure
(ﬁg. 1c) with a single central atom. That central core
atom does not interchange its position with any of the 19
surface atoms, at least within the 20 ps of the simulations.
The 19 surface atoms are very mobile and the structure
of the cluster ﬂuctuates a great deal. The exploration
at these temperatures of an essentially new isomer leads
to the second peak in the speciﬁc heat, and we iden-
tify Tm2 ≈ 150K with an isomerization-like transition in
which a new (19+1) isomer is explored. In the tempera-
ture range between Tm2 and Tm3 , the core atom remains
in its central position, and the surface of the cluster is
molten, in the sense that the structure is very ﬂuid, and
the surface disorder is large.

Another abrupt increase at Tm3 ≈ 220 K is seen in
the δ(T) curve. This last increase in δ is associated with
the interchange of positions between the central atom

and the peripheral atoms. Now that all the atoms in-
terchange positions, and the cluster structure ﬂuctuates
greatly, we can consider the melting of the cluster to be
complete. This last step of the melting process is not
reﬂected in the speciﬁc heat because the exploration of
conﬁguration space does not increase signiﬁcantly. This
point highlights the importance of using diﬀerent indica-
tors of melting for obtaining detailed information on the
melting processes in ﬁnite systems.

In ﬁg. 6 we show the short-time averaged σi(t) for sev-
eral representative temperatures. At T=32 K (ﬁg. 6(a))
the cluster is solid-like and < σi(t) >sta serves to identify
groups of “nearly” equivalent atoms. Starting from the
bottom, these are: the two central atoms, the ﬁve atoms
of the central pentagon, the 10 atoms in the upper and
lower pentagons, and ﬁnally the two axial atoms and the
capping atom. At T=72 K the diﬀerent groups can still
be recognized, but ﬁg. 6(b) shows that at 137 K there is
a group of two central atoms, but the rest of atoms are
no longer distinguishable. At T=215 K (ﬁg. 6(c)) we see
that the cluster has a single central atom for most of the
simulation time, the 19 atom surface is melted, and occa-
sionally a surface atom makes a temporary excursion into
the core region. Finally, at T=271 K all the atoms inter-
change positions and the cluster is completely melted. At
even higher temperatures the interchange rate increases.
Simulations of the melting-like transitions of Na20 have
been performed by PSL.8 As for Na8, the GS structure of
Na20 predicted by PSL is diﬀerent from that of KS-LDA
calculations, although it may also be divided in “core”
and “surface” regions. The surface-melting phenomenon
is also observed by PSL; speciﬁcally, their calculations
predict a surface-melting temperature Ts=190 K, and
a melting temperature Tm=300 K. The discrepancy be-
tween these quantities and the transition temperatures
obtained in the present work should be ascribed again
to the diﬀerences in the interatomic interactions. RA11
have performed just two short ab initio KS-LDA molec-
ular dynamics simulations of Na20. At T=350 K, the
lowest one they considered, they found that the mobility
of the atoms in Na20 is already quite high within the 3
ps of their simulation, but such a short simulation time
led to a value of δ ≈ 0.1. If the average is taken over
the ﬁrst 3 ps of the run performed at T=324 K, we ob-
tain δ=0.15, in contrast with the converged value δ=0.29.
Thus, a simulation time of 3 ps, corresponding to ∼ 5 vi-
brational periods, does not allow for the number of jumps
necessary to obtain a converged value of δ.

The melting-like transition in both Na8 and Na20 is
found to be spread over a broad temperature range, and
in the case of Na20 we have identiﬁed a stepwise melt-
ing mechanism. Recently, Rey et al.36 have related the
occurrence of melting in steps to the softness of the repul-
sive core interaction. Speciﬁcally, they have studied the
melting-like transition of a cluster with 13 particles in-
teracting through model potentials diﬀering just in their
repulsive parts. For the softer potentials considered, two
abrupt increases of δ are found: the ﬁrst one corresponds
to the onset of isomerization transitions involving only
surface atoms, and the second to complete melting. The
stepwise melting mechanism is less clearly deﬁned when

6

employing the harder interatomic potentials. The main
conclusion of their work is that the melting in steps may
be a consequence of the softness of the repulsive core
of the potential rather than of the many-body charac-
ter of the interactions. We have performed a series of
GE2PS static calculations for Na2 at several interatomic
distances in order to construct the binding energy curve,
and have compared it to the interatomic potentials con-
sidered by Rey et al.36 We ﬁnd that the repulsive part
of the binding energy curve obtained using the GE2PS is
softer than their softest interatomic potential, and so the
stepwise melting we have found is consistent with their
ﬁndings.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have applied an ab initio, density-
based, molecular dynamics method to the study of melt-
ing transitions in ﬁnite atomic systems. The computa-
tional eﬀort which is required is modest in comparison
with that required by the traditional CP-MD technique
based in the use of the KS one-particle orbitals. Specif-
ically, the computational eﬀort to update the electronic
system scales linearly with the system size N, in contrast
to the N3 scaling of orbital-based methods. This saving
allows the method to be used in the study of large clus-
ters, and also for performing extensive MD simulations
in much the same way as the usual procedures involving
phenomenological potentials, which has been the goal of
the present paper.

The method has been applied here to the study of the
melting-like transitions in Na8 and Na20 microclusters.
Na8 melts in a broad temperature range of 110–220 K.
The transition at ∼ 100 K is from a rigid cluster in
which the atoms are vibrating around their ﬁxed equi-
librium positions to a phase in which the diﬀerent per-
mutational isomers of the GS structure are visited. For
higher temperatures the cluster distorts more and more
from the GS structure and can be considered fully liquid
at T≈220 K. Na20 undergoes several successive trans-
formations with increasing temperature, and the melting
transition is spread over a wide range of temperatures.
The ﬁrst relevant transition is observed at a temperature
Tm1 ≈ 110 K. The surface atoms swap their positions
without destroying the underlying icosahedral symmetry,
that is the cluster visits several permutational isomers of
the GS structure. At Tm2 ≈ 150 K, one of the inner
“core” atoms becomes surface-like and the other remains
in its central position. The picture is that of a surface
melted cluster, but for an isomer diﬀerent from the GS
one. Finally, at Tm3 ≈ 220 K, the melting is complete
and all the atoms undergo diﬀusive motion throughout
the cluster volume. The temperatures of the melting in-
tervals that we have obtained are lower than the exper-
imental melting temperature of bulk Na (Tbulk
m = 371
K) . This is expected on physical grounds. Preliminary
calculations for the melting of bulk Na which we have
performed using the orbital-free method described ear-
lier give a melting temperature in very good agreement
with experiment, which gives us conﬁdence in the quan-

titative results we obtained for the melting temperatures
of the clusters.

The importance of evaluating several distinct melting
indicators in order to determine unambigously the nature
of the transitions is stressed. In this respect, the use of
partial mean square displacements, deﬁned for geometri-
cally inequivalent groups of atoms, as well as the use of
the “atomic equivalence indexes”, proved really helpful.
Comparison with other theoretical calculations per-
formed at diﬀerent levels of theory suggests that our re-
sults agree essentially with the ab initio KS-LDA calcu-
lations of R¨othlisberger and Andreoni if the same simula-
tion times are considered. We consider this agreement to
be strong validation of our model. However, we found it
necessary to lengthen the simulation times to at least 20
ps in order to obtain converged global quantities. With
the improved statistics, our results for Na8 are in bet-
ter agreement with those of Bulgac and Kusnezov (BK)
than with those of Poteau et al (PSL), if we disregard
the second transition observed by BK and consider their
ﬁrst to be the melting transition.

Based on ab initio and density-functional theory calculations, an empirical potential is proposed
to model the interaction between a fullerene molecule and many sodium atoms. This model predicts
homogeneous coverage of C60 below 8 Na atoms, and a progressive droplet formation above this
size. The eﬀects of ionization, temperature, and external electric ﬁeld indicate that the various, and
apparently contradictory, experimental results can indeed be put into agreement.

Fullerene molecules are now commonly used as build-
ing blocks of complex materials having unusual physical
and chemical properties [1]. The possibilities oﬀered by
molecules such as C60 or C70 in terms of electric or op-
tical devices have laid ground for the rapidly expanding
nanotechnology area. The interaction between fullerenes
and alkali atoms has attracted a lot of attention after
the discovery of superconductivity in the K3C60 solid [2].
Sodium-C60 compounds have also received much atten-
tion [3, 4]. More recently, several groups investigated ex-
perimentally the gas phase properties of exohedral alkali-
C60 compounds [5, 6, 7], to further predict the solid state
of alkali-doped fullerite.

Using mass spectrometry, Martin and coworkers [6]
inferred from the most stable “magic numbers” that
sodium covers the C60 molecule in a continuous and
homogeneous fashion, and that metallic bonding starts
above 6 metal atoms. Palpant and coworkers [7] de-
duced from photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
that coating proceeds by trimers units rather than single
atoms. They also estimated that metallic bonding only
appears at n = 13 sodium atoms. Very recently, Dugourd
and coworkers [8] measured the electric polarizability of
NanC60 clusters in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 34. They con-
cluded that a sodium droplet is formed on the surface of
the fullerene. These apparent contradictory results are
surprising, as far as they rely on similar experimental
conditions but diﬀerent interpretations.

The situation is in fact even more intricate due to the
variety of theoretical conclusions on the very same sys-
tems [9, 10, 11, 12]. With the exception of the study by
Rubio and coworkers [9], which assumes complete wet-
ting of C60 by sodium in a continuous two-shell jellium
description, the electronic structure calculations by Hira
and Ray [10, 11], and by Hamamoto et al.
[12] reach
diﬀerent conclusions as to whether the Na2 molecule re-
mains as a dimer or dissociates into atoms, which locate
on opposite sides of C60. At the unrestricted Hartree-
Fock level, Hira and Ray ﬁnd that charge transfer is neg-
ligible in NaC60, in apparent contradiction with experi-
ments [7, 8], and also that Na2 remains as a dimer loosely
bound to C60. On the other hand, the more realistic
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations performed

by Hamamoto and coworkers [12] at the local density
approximation level tend to favor regular coating, pref-
erentially by trimers, in agreement with the picture of
Palpant et al.
[7]. However, all these ab initio investi-
gations could only focus on very limited sets of chosen
geometries, simply because global optimization on such
complex energy landscapes is far beyond the current pos-
sibilities of fully quantum mechanical approaches. In ad-
dition, statistical and temperature eﬀects still remain a
major limitation in large scale simulations based on ﬁrst
principles.

To overcome the above diﬃculties, we have constructed
an empirical, ab initio based atomistic model allowing
systematic static and dynamical investigations in a large
size range. Brieﬂy, given the geometry R = {ri, r′
j } of
the NanC60
j ∈ C60, the
total potential energy is written as

Q system, with ri ∈ Nan and r′

V (R) = VNan (ri) + VC60 (r′

j ) + Vinter(R) + VCoul(R),

(1)

where VNan , VC60 , Vinter, and VCoul are the energies of
sodium, C60, covalent interactions between Na and C60,
and Coulomb interactions, respectively. Metallic forces in
sodium are described by a simple many-body potential in
the second-moment approximation of the electronic den-
sity of states in the tight-binding theory [13]. Covalent
forces in C60 were most often neglected, as the temper-
atures of interest are low enough (< 300 K) to keep the
fullerene rigid. We occasionaly checked the rigidity of C60
in some optimal structures with the Tersoﬀ potential [14].
The covalent interaction between sodium and carbon
atoms was modelled as a pairwise repulsion term taken
from ab initio calculations of the 4Π state of the NaC
molecule, and expressed as V covalent
(r) = D exp(−αr).
To account for charge transfer, and to quantify the ex-
tent of ionic interaction in the system, ﬂuctuating charges
Q = {qi, q′
j ∈ C60, were added to
all atoms in the system. For any geometry R, the charges
are determined in order to minimize the global Coulomb
interaction VCoul, which is equivalent to equalizing the ef-

j}, with qi ∈ Nan and q′

In this equation, i and j label sodium and carbon atoms,
respectively. εNa and εC are the respective electronega-
tivities of sodium and carbon, HNa and HC their ‘hard-
nesses’, Jij the Coulomb interactions. The hardnesses
parameters correspond to the on-site repulsion in the
Hubbard model. The latter quantities were extracted
from ab initio calculations of the Coulomb integrals. Due
to the ﬁnite delocalization of the electrons, Jij does not
diverge at short distances. We have used the simple ex-
−2
ij exp(−γijr2)
pression Jij (r) =
to model
(cid:3)
the Coulomb parts of the Na–Na, C–C, and Na–C inter-
actions. The hardnesses parameters HNa and HC are the
r → 0 limits of JNa−Na and JC−C. Finally, the Lagrange
multiplier λ in (2) ensures that the system carries a global
charge Q. This electrostatic model was further improved
by including 90 ﬁxed charges, 60 on each carbon site
with value δq, 30 on the middle of each C=C bond with
value −2δq. This was previously used by Schelkacheva
Tareyeva in a study of bulk C60 [16].

The dynamical use of the full potential energy func-
tion is greatly facilitated by considering an extended La-
grangian where the ﬂuctuating charges are treated as in-
dependent variables [17], in a way similar to the Car-
Parrinello scheme [18]. This empirical model has 15 pa-
rameters, namely the 5 parameters of the SMA potential,
the 2 parameters of the covalent Na–C interaction, the
electronegativity diﬀerence εC − εNa, the 6 parameters
of the Coulomb interactions (including hardnesses), and
the ﬁxed charge δq. These parameters were obtained
by minimizing an error function χ2 to reproduce sev-
eral properties independently evaluated by ab initio and
DFT calculations [19] with the B3LYP nonlocal func-
tional [20]. These properties are the charge transferred
from sodium (0.87e) and the electric dipole (14.5 D) in
NaC60, the energy diﬀerence between the two Na2C60 iso-
mers with sodium atoms on adjacent or opposite hexag-
onal sites (∆E = −0.35 eV), and the binding energy
and equilibrium distance in Na2 (resp. De =0.73 eV and
Re =3.08 ˚A). It should be noticed that these theoretical
values agree well with the experimental data available
[8]. We also added to the error function a penalty term
to reproduce the experimental electric polarizability of
the C60 molecule (76.5 ˚A3 [21]).

The lowest energy structures of NanC60 clusters were
determined using a variant of the basin-hopping, or
Monte Carlo + minimization algorithm [22], in which
each sodium atom is oﬀered a probability to rotate freely

2

over the C60 surface, in addition to the usual random
displacements moves. Some of the optimal structures are
represented in Fig. 1 for the sizes n = 4, 7, 8, 12, and 20.

Up to seven sodium atoms, the empirical model predicts
“wetted” structures, where each alkali atom stays over
an hexagonal site. In this regime, the Coulomb repulsion
between the positive charges carried by the sodium atoms
is minimized by keeping the atoms as far away as possible
from each other. At the stage of 7 atoms, there is only
little space left on the C60 surface to add an extra eighth
isolated atom, and the energy gained in creating Na–Na
bonds gets larger than the electrostatic penalty. This em-
bryonic droplet further grows as new sodium atoms are
incorporated, and progressively spreads over the C60 sur-
face. Growth occasionally proceeds by removing one of
the remaining isolated atoms on the side opposite to the
droplet, and may eventually end in a single, big droplet.
The largest system considered here, Na30C60, however,
still shows one main droplet and two isolated atoms.

To provide a more complete interpretation of the ex-
periments, we have considered the separate eﬀects of tem-
perature, ionization, and a possible external electric ﬁeld
on the transition between coated and segregated mor-
phologies. Equilibrium dynamics at constant tempera-
ture was achieved by supplementing the extended La-
grangian with two sets of Nos´e-Hoover chain thermostats
[23], one set at the desired ionic temperature T , one set
to keep the average kinetic energy of the charges to a low
value T ∗ = T /100. Thermostating the charges also pre-
vents the ﬁctitious dynamics to diverge too much from
the adiabatic, Born-Oppenheimer type dynamics [24].
Diﬀusion constants were estimated from the slopes of the
average mean square atomic displacements versus time in
a set of 500 simulations at various temperatures in the
range 25 K≤ T ≤300 K, with increments 25 K. In Fig. 2,
these diﬀusion constants are represented for the sizes 4,

8, 12, and 20 as a function of 1/T in an Arrhenius plot.
These plots provide us with estimates of the correspond-
ing activation barriers, for which we ﬁnd A ≃ 400 K for
all four sizes. At room temperature, sodium atoms thus
show a signiﬁcant mobility over the C60 surface. This
agrees with the recent experimental ﬁndings on KC60
[25]. To quantify the eﬀect of temperature on the mor-
phology in NanC60, we have calculated the average size
of the largest sodium fragment. A fragment is here de-
ﬁned as a set of connected atoms, i.e. having at least
one neighbor at a distance shorter than 8 bohr. The
same geometrical observable was also computed at T = 0
for neutral or singly charged molecules. In the case of
+ and
charged systems, global optimization of NanC60
− without electric ﬁeld was performed for sizes
NanC60
near the crossover, n ≤ 12. Lastly, we have compared

geneous ﬁeld of magnitude E = 2.55×108 V.m−1 relevant
to the experiments of Dugourd et al. [8], and at zero tem-
perature. The corresponding data were averaged on 30
diﬀerent orientations of the ﬁeld, relative to the C60 ge-
ometry. Global optimization was carried out for each of
these orientations. The variations of the largest fragment
size hN i against the total number of sodium atoms n are
plotted in Fig. 3. The rise of hN i at the crossover size n∗
marks the onset of droplet formation. As temperature
increases, isolated atoms are more likely to meet either
with each other or with the preexisting droplet. This
lowers n∗ by a visible amount. However, 300 K is a rela-
tively high temperature for sodium clusters lying usually
above their melting points [26]. Thus, external bonds are
often broken in the course of the dynamics, which results
in lowering hN i at larger n. Ionizing the cluster can also
strongly aﬀect the crossover size n∗: negatively charged
molecules are more stable in segregated form due to a
much lower Coulomb repulsion of the alkali atoms, and
positively charged molecules are less stable and remain

homogeneously coated up to n = 10.

At the experimental value, a ﬁnite electric ﬁeld dis-
favors regular location of the charges over the nearly
spherical C60 surface. This yields more frequent metallic
bonds. In addition, the lowest energy structures found
for all ﬁeld directions can also change signiﬁcantly. For
instance, as seen in Fig. 1, two sodium atoms get closer
to one another, yet they still do not form a bond at 0 K.
Electric susceptibilities χ have been estimated with the
present model using the high-temperature approximation
to the Langevin theory for rigid dipoles undergoing ori-
entational thermal ﬂuctuations: χ = α + µ2/3kBT . In
this formula α is the static polarizability, kB is the Boltz-
mann constant, and µ the electric dipole. The variations
of χ with cluster size n are shown in Fig. 4. They qual-

itatively resemble the experimental data of Dugourd et
al. [8], but lie somewhat lower than the actual measured

values. This may ﬁrst come from the parameterization.
We tested this hypothesis by comparing the predictions
of the present empirical model to single-point DFT cal-
culations performed at the same geometry. The electric
dipoles given in the inset of Fig. 4 show good agreement
between the empirical and electronic structure estimates.
We also note that the strong variations in the dipole re-
ﬂect the changes in the molecular symmetry. It is also
worth pointing out that the model predicts an energet-
ical ordering of the isomers essentially similar to that
found by Hamamoto et al.
[12] for the very restricted
set of structures considered by these authors. Therefore,
the quantitative diﬀerence between our results and the
experimental data more likely comes from the Langevin
formula, strictly valid for rigid dipoles. This approxima-
tion may be insuﬃcient to describe the dipole ﬂuctua-
tions associated with the ﬂoppy character of the metal
droplet. However, regarding the diﬀerence between the
present results and the data obtained in Ref. 8, adding
several isolated atoms on the opposite side of the growing
droplet decreases the dipole moment, hence the suscep-
tibility. A fully dynamical simulation would probably be
required to get a more quantitative agreement.

The present investigation shows that the appearance
of metallic bonding corresponds to seeding a droplet,
which progressively grows and captures remaining iso-
lated atoms. This picture partly reconciles the appar-
ently contradictory experimental interpretations [6, 7, 8].
The empirical potential was ﬁtted to reproduce electronic
structure calculations as well as some experimental data.
By allowing large scale simulations and structural sam-
pling unaccessible to quantum mechanical studies, we
could estimate the crossover size between wetted and
nonwetted morphologies to be located near 8 atoms. This
is also the size range where the metallic transition can be
estimated to occur. We have also been able to investigate

4

how the crossover size depends on various eﬀects such as
charge or temperature.

The current limitations of the present empirical model
are mostly due to the lack of an explicit account of elec-
tronic structure. Even though Coulomb repulsion should
play an important role when only few sodium atoms are
eﬀectively charged but close to each other, shell closing
can enhance stability in a local way. In particular, this
could help in explaining why charged trimers remain sta-
ble. Such quantum eﬀects are obviously beyond the ﬂuc-
tuating charges model, especially with its current train-
ing on purely neutral molecules. A next step could be a
simple quantum tight-binding approach, which would in-
clude both covalent and charge transfer eﬀects. However,
a realistic tight-binding Hamiltonian for the NanC60 sys-
tem would require 240 + n electronic states (4 s + p elec-
trons for each carbon atom, 1 s valence for each sodium
atom). This is still too heavy for exhaustive sampling
and large scale simulations.
In addition, precise quan-
tum eﬀects are essentially expected at small sizes, and
the role of a single charge on the structure and stability
should decrease as the sodium droplet grows.

For large sizes, it would be interesting to study in more
details how the physical and chemical properties of the
sodium droplet are modiﬁed by the interaction with the
C60 molecule. The inﬂuence of the C60 deformation and
vibration on the metal cluster dynamics could also be
an important issue. Use of the present model to treat
other metals could help in understanding the diﬀerences
observed in the experiments [7, 8, 27]. Further exten-
sions, including the treatment of endohedral or exohedral
fullerenes, nanotubes or surfaces with materials possibly
other than metals [28, 29], could also be carried out.

The density functional calculations were performed us-
ing the GAUSSIAN98 software package [30]. We thank
CALMIP for a generous allocation of computer resources.

Abstract. Algorithm, based on explicit representations for the analytic contin-
uation of Faddeev components of the three-body T-matrix in unphysical energy
sheets, is employed to study mechanism of disappearance and formation of the
Eﬁmov levels of the helium 4He trimer.

1 Introduction

Explicit representations for the Faddeev components of the three-body T-
matrix continued analytically into unphysical sheets of the energy Riemann
surface have been formulated and proved recently in Ref. [1]. According to the
representations, the T-matrix in unphysical sheets is explicitly expressed in
terms of its components only taken in the physical sheet. Analogous explicit
representations were also found for the analytic continuation of the three-body
scattering matrices. These representations disclose the structure of kernels of
the T- and S-matrices after continuation and give new capacities for analytical
and numerical studies of the three-body resonances. In particular the represen-
tations imply that the resonance poles of the S-matrix as well as T-matrix in
an unphysical sheet correspond merely to the zeros of the suitably truncated
three-body scattering matrix taken in the physical sheet. Therefore, one can
search for resonances in a certain unphysical sheet staying always, nevertheless,
in the physical sheet and only calculating the position of zeros of the appropri-
ate truncation of the total three-body scattering matrix. This statement holds
true not only for the case of the conventional smooth quickly decreasing inter-
actions but also for the case of the singular interactions described by diﬀerent
variants of the Boundary Condition Model, in particular for the inter–particle
interactions of a hard-core nature like in most molecular systems.

As a concrete application of the method, we present here the results of
our numerical study of the simplest truncation of the scattering matrix in the
4He three-atomic system, namely of the (2 + 1
2 + 1) S-matrix component
corresponding to the scattering of a 4He atom oﬀ a 4He dimer. The point is
that there is already a series of works [2]–[4] (also see Refs. [5]–[7]) showing that
the excited state of the 4He trimer is initiated by the Eﬁmov eﬀect [8]. In these
works, various versions of the 4He–4He potential were employed. However, the
basic result of Refs. [2]–[4] on the excited state of the helium trimer is the
same: this state disappears after the interatomic potential is multiplied by the
increasing factor λ when it approaches the value about 1.2. It is just such
a nonstandard behavior of the excited-state energy as the coupling between
helium atoms becomes more and more strengthening, points to the Eﬁmov
nature of the trimer excited state. The present work is aimed at elucidating
the fate of the trimer excited state upon its disappearance in the physical
sheet when λ > 1 and at studying the mechanism of arising of new excited
states when λ < 1. As the interatomic He – He potential, we use the potential
HFD-B [9]. We have established that for such He – He - interactions the trimer
excited-state energy merges with the two-body threshold ǫd at λ
1.18 and
with further decreasing λ it transforms into a virtual level of the ﬁrst order (a
simple real pole of the analytic continuation of the (2 + 1
2 + 1) scattering
matrix component) lying in the unphysical energy sheet adjoining the physical
sheet along the spectral interval between ǫd and the three–body threshold. We
trace the position of this level for λ increasing up to 1.5. Besides, we have
found that the excited (Eﬁmov) levels for λ < 1 also originate from virtual
levels of the ﬁrst order that are formed in pairs. Before a pair of virtual levels
appears, there occurs a fusion of a pair of conjugate resonances of the ﬁrst order
(simple complex poles of the analytic continuation of the scattering matrix in
the unphysical sheet) resulting in the virtual level of the second order.

2 Representations for three-body T – and S – matrices

in unphysical energy sheets

The method used for calculation of resonances in the present work, is based on
the explicit representations [1] for analytic continuation of the T- and scattering
matrices in unphysical sheets which hold true at least for a part of the three-
body Riemann surface. To describe this part we introduce the auxiliary vector-
function f(z) = (f0(z), f1,1(z), ..., f1,n1 (z), f2,1(z), ..., f2,n2 (z), f3,1(z), ..., f3,n3 (z))
λα,j )1/2. Here, by z we understand the
with f0(z) = ln z and fα,j(z) = (z
total three-body energy in the c. m. system and by λα,j, the respective binding
. The
energies of the two-body subsystems α, α = 1, 2, 3, j = 1, 2, ..., nα, nα <
sheets Πl of the Riemann surface of the vector-function f(z) are numerated by
the multi-index l = (l0, l1,1, ..., l1,n1, l2,1, ..., l2,n2 , l3,1, ..., l3,n3), where lα,j = 0 if
the sheet Πl corresponds to the main (arithmetic) branch of the square root
λα)1/2. Otherwise, lα,j = 1 is assumed. Value of l0 coincides with the
(z
+ i 2πl0 + iφ where
number of the branch of the function ln z, ln z = ln
φ = arg z. For the physical sheet identiﬁed by l0 = lα,j = 0, α = 1, 2, 3, j =
1, 2, ..., nα, we use the notation Π0.

Surely, the structure of the total three-body Riemann surface is essentially

more complicated than that of the auxiliary function f. For instance, the sheets
Πl with l0 =
1 have additional branching points corresponding to resonances
of the two-body subsystems. The part of the total three-body Riemann surface
where the representations of Ref. [1] are valid, consists of the sheets Πl of the
Riemann surface of the function f identiﬁed by l0 = 0 (such unphysical sheets
1 and
are called two-body sheets) and two three-body sheets identiﬁed by l0 =

3 Method for search of resonances in a three–body system

on the basis of the Faddeev diﬀerential equations

In this work we discuss the example of the three-atomic 4He system at the
total angular momentum L = 0. We consider the case where the interatomic
interactions include a hard core component and, outside the hard core domain,
are described by conventional smooth potentials. In this case, the angular par-
tial analysis reduces the initial Faddeev equation for three identical bosons to
a system of coupled two-dimensional integro-diﬀerential equations (see Ref. [4]
and references therein)

values. The He–He potential V (x) acting outside the core domain is assumed

S0(z) = 1 + 2ia0(z) .

Our goal is to study the analytic continuation of the function S0(z) into the
physical sheet. As it follows from the results of Refs. [1], the function S0(z) is
just that truncation of the total scattering matrix whose roots in the physical
sheet of the energy z plane correspond to the location of resonances situated
in the unphysical sheet adjoining the physical one along the spectral interval
(ǫd, 0).

There are the following three important domains in the the physical sheet.
1◦. The domain Π (Ψ ) where the Faddeev components Fl(x, y; z) (and, hence,
the wave functions Ψl(x, y; z)) can be analytically continued in z so that the
diﬀerences Φl(x, y; z) = Fl(x, y; z)

where the analytic continuation in z, z

plitude a0(z) (and consequently, for the scattering matrix S0(z)); the analytic
continuabilty of the amplitudes Al(z, θ) in the whole domain Π (S) is not re-

4 Numerical results

In the present work we search for the resonances of the 4He trimer including
the virtual levels as roots of S0(z) and for the bound-state energies as positions
of poles of S0(z). All the results presented below are obtained for the case
lmax = 0. In all our calculations, ~2/m = 12.12 K ˚A2. As the interatomic He –
He - interaction we employed the HFD-B potential constructed by R. A. Aziz
and co-workers [9].

The value of the core range c is chosen to be so small that its further
decrease does not appreciably inﬂuence the dimer binding energy ǫd and the
trimer ground-state energy E(0)
. Unlike the paper [4], where c was taken to
be equal 0.7 ˚A, now we take c = 1.3 ˚A. We have found that such a value of c
provides at least six reliable ﬁgures of ǫd and three ﬁgures of E(0)

.

Since the statements of Sect. 3 are valid, generally speaking, only for the
potentials decreasing not slower than exponentially, we cut oﬀ the potential
HFD-B setting V (x) = 0 for x > r0. We have established that this cutoﬀ for
r0 & 95 ˚A provides the same values of ǫd (ǫd =
t =
0.096 K) and scattering phases which were obtained in earlier calculations

[4] performed with the potential HFD-B. Also, we have found that the trimer
excited-state energy E(1)
2.46 mK. Comparison of these results with results
of other researchers can be found in Ref. [4]. In all the calculations of the present
work we take r0 = 100 ˚A. Note that if the formulas from Sect. 3 describing the
holomorphy domains Π (Ψ ), Π (A) and Π (S) are used for ﬁnite potentials, one
should set in them µ = +

the intersection points of the curves Re S0(z) = 0 and Im S0(z) = 0 and are located at

the grids of dimension Nθ = Nρ = 600 — 1000. In essential, we chose the values
of the cutoﬀ hyperradius ρmax = ρNρ from the scaling considerations (see [4]).
We solve the resultant block-three-diagonal algebraic system on the basis of
the matrix sweep method. This allows us to dispense with writing the system
matrix on the hard drive and to carry out all the operations related to its inver-
sion immediately in RAM. Besides, the matrix sweep method reduces almost
by one order the computer time required for computations on the grids of the
same dimensions as in [4].

Because of the symmetry relationship S0(z) = S0(z) we performed all the
0. First, we calculated the root lines
calculations for S0(z) only at Im z

of the functions Re S0(z) and Im S0(z). For the case of the grid parameters
Nθ = Nρ = 600 and ρmax = 600 ˚A these lines are depicted in Fig. 1. Both res-
onances (roots of S0(z)) and bound-state energies (poles of S0(z)) of the 4He
trimer are associated with the intersection points of the curves Re S0(z) = 0 and
Im S0(z) = 0. In Fig. 1, along with the root lines we also plot the boundaries of
the domains Π (S), Π (A) and Π (Ψ ). One can observe that the “good” domain
Π (S) includes none of the points of intersection of the root lines Re S0(z) = 0
and Im S0(z) = 0. The caption for Fig. 1 points out positions of four “res-

levels and then the energies of the excited (Eﬁmov) states appear just due to
these (quasi)resonances when the potential V (x) is weakened.

1.04 + i 0.11) mK for λ = 0.989 and
0.99 + i 0.04) mK for λ = 0.9885. With a subsequent decrease of λ the
z = (
virtual level of the second order splits into a pair of the ﬁrst order virtual levels
E(2)
which move in opposite directions. A charac-
∗t
teristic behavior of the scattering matrix S0(z) when the resonances transform
into virtual levels is shown in Fig. 2. The virtual level E(2)
moves towards
the threshold ǫd and “collides” with it at λ < 0.98. For λ = 0.975 the function
S0(z) has no longer the root corresponding to E(2)
. Instead of the root, it
acquires a new pole corresponding to the second excited state of the trimer
with the energy E(2)
. We expect that the subsequent Eﬁmov levels originate
from the virtual levels just according to the same scheme as the level E(2)
t does.
The other purpose of the present investigation is to determine the mecha-
nism of disappearance of the excited state of the helium trimer when the two-
body interactions become stronger owing to the increasing λ > 1. It turned out
that this disappearance proceeds just according to the scheme of the formation
of new excited states; only the order of occurring events is inverse. The results
of our computations of the energy E(1)
t when λ changes from 1.05 to 1.17 are

given in Table 4.2. In the interval between λ = 1.17 and λ = 1.18 there occurs
a “jump” of the level E(1)
on the unphysical sheet and it transforms from the
pole of the function S0(z) into its root, E(1)
, corresponding to the trimer vir-
∗t
tual level. The results of calculation of this virtual level where λ changes from
1.18 to 1.5 are also presented in Table 4.2.

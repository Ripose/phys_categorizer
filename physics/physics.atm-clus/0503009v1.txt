We report electronic and magnetic structure of arsenic-doped manganese clusters from density-
functional theory using generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation energy. We
ﬁnd that arsenic stabilizes manganese clusters, though the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn atoms
are found only in Mn2As and Mn4As clusters with magnetic moments 9 µB and 17 µB, respectively.
For all other sizes, x = 3, 5-10, MnxAs clusters show ferrimagnetic coupling. It is suggested that, if
grown during the low temperature MBE, the giant magnetic moments due to ferromagnetic coupling
in Mn2As and Mn4As clusters could play a role on the ferromagnetism and on the variation observed
in the Curie temperature of Mn-doped III-V semiconductors.

Manganese is a unique 3d transition metal element due
to its unusual and fascinating electronic and magnetic be-
havior as atom, cluster, crystal and as well as impurity.
The ﬁlled 4s and half-ﬁlled 3d shell and the large energy
gap ∼ 8 eV between them prevent signiﬁcant s − d hy-
bridization and therefore they do not bind strongly as
Mn atoms begin to form cluster[1, 2]. Similarly, α-Mn,
the most stable form of bulk Mn, has the least binding
energy among all the 3d transition metal elements. The
magnetic properties of Mn clusters are particularly inter-
esting. An early electron spin resonance study on small
Mn clusters in an inert matrix suggested ferromagnetic
ordering with magnetic moment 5 µB/atom [3]. More re-
cently, through Stern-Gerlach (SG) molecular beam ex-
periment [4], Knickelbein found that manganese clusters
in the size range Mn5 - Mn99 display ferrimagnetic order-
ing with a maximum magnetic moment ∼ 1.72 µB/atom
for Mn12, despite of the fact that no known bulk phase
of Mn displays such ordering. Recent density functional
theory (DFT) calculations [1, 2] conﬁrm this ferrimag-
netic coupling in the size range x ≥5 in Mnx clusters.

Manganese doped semiconductors, such as (GaMn)As
and (InMn)As have attracted considerable attention be-
cause of their carrier induced ferromagnetism [5]. The
Mn dopants in these III-V dilute magnetic semiconduc-
tors serve the dual roles of provision of magnetic mo-
ments and acceptor production. Earlier experimental re-
sults on Ga1−xMnxAs indicate a nonmonotonic behav-
ior of Curie temperature Tc(x), ﬁrst increases with the
Mn concentration x, reaching a maximum of 110 K for
x ∼5% and then decreases with the further increase of x.
However, recent experimental studies [6, 7], under care-
fully controlled growth and annealing conditions, suggest
that the metastable nature and high defect content of
low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown
Ga1−xMnxAs may be playing an important role in de-
termining the magnetic properties. In particular, under
suitable conditions, careful annealing could lead to an

enhancement in Tc with increasing Mn content [6, 7].
Chiba et al. [6] have reported a maximum Tc as high as
160 K, for 7.4 % Mn concentration, in a layered struc-
ture. However, the detailed microscopic nature and the
role of the metastable defects in Ga1−xMnxAs are not
yet well understood both theoretically and experimen-
tally and demands more investigation. Strong segrega-
tion tendency of the doped transition metal atoms into
the semiconductor host [8] makes Mn clustering, around
As in Ga1−xMnxAs samples, a very important issue.

In this Letter, we address the possibility of such clus-
tering of Mn around As, and if so, then what is the nature
of Mn-Mn magnetic coupling? We have, indeed, found
that the binding energy of Mn clusters are substantially
enhanced by single As doping by having their hybridized
s − d electrons bond with p electrons of As. This stabi-
lization is accompanied by the ferromagnetic or ferrimag-
netic coupling between Mn atoms, all of which results in
the large cluster magnetic moments, which could play a
crucial role in the observed ferromagnetism and deter-
mining the Curie temperature Tc, in Mn-doped GaAs
and InAs.

Calculations have been carried out using DFT, within
the plane wave method [9]. We have employed
projector augmented-wave method [10] and Perdew-
Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional [11] for
the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation
(GGA), as implemented in the VASP package [12]. The
wave functions are expanded in a plane wave basis set
with the kinetic energy cutoﬀ equal to 337.3 eV and the
calculations were carried out at the Γ point. The 3d, 4s
for Mn and 4s, 4p orbitals for As were treated as va-
lence states. Symmetry unrestricted geometry optimiza-
tions were performed using quasi Newtonian and con-
jugate gradient methods until all the force components
are less than 0.005 eV/˚A. Simple cubic supercells are
used with neighboring clusters separated by at least 12˚A
vacuum regions. Several initial structures were studied

to ensure that the globally optimized geometry does not
correspond to the local minima, as well as, for all clusters,
we have explicitly considered all possible spin multiplici-
ties to determine the ground state magnetic moment.

We begin our discussions with pure Mnx (x ≤10) clus-
ters, some of which (x ≤7) have also been studied pre-
viously within the all-electron calculation and diﬀerent
levels of GGA [2]. We have found ferromagnetic cou-
pling for Mn2, Mn3 and Mn4 with magnetic moment 5
µB/atom, the Hund’s rule value for the free atom. Emer-
gence of ferrimagnetic coupling starts form Mn5. The
total magnetic moments of Mnx clusters corresponding
to the ground state geometries, for x = 5-10, are 3, 8, 5,
8, 7 and 14 µB respectively (see Table I), which are in
excellent agreement with the recent SG experiment [4].
Because of the half-ﬁlled 3d and ﬁlled 4s shell and a sub-
stantial gap between them, we found Mn2 is a weakly
bound van der Walls (vdW) dimer with bond length 2.58
˚A and binding energy 0.53 eV/atom, as it is evident from
the low experimental value [13]. Antiferromagnetic Mn2
dimer is 0.53 eV higher in energy, whereas for Mn3, the
frustrated antiferromagnetic structure is almost degen-
erate (0.05 eV higher in energy) with the ferromagnetic
structure. As x increases, binding energy increases mono-
tonically [Fig.1(a)], reaches a value 1.94 eV/atom, 66%
of bulk α-Mn, for Mn10. We note, generally, the Mn-Mn
bonds between like spins are larger (2.30-2.85 ˚A) than
that of between opposite spins (2.20-2.75 ˚A). Several iso-
mers lying close in energy to the ground state of Mnx
were found which will be discussed elsewhere [1], in de-
tail.

In the Fig.??, we depict the ground state geometries
of MnxAs clusters with their spin ordering. The MnAs
dimer has much higher binding energy, 1.12 eV/atom,
and much shorter bond length, 2.21 ˚A, than the Mn2
vdW dimer. We have repeated the calculations of MnAs
dimer, including Mn 3p as valence state [14], and have
obtained an optimized bond length 2.22 ˚A and binding
energy 1.08 eV/atom with same total magnetic moment.

Binding energy increases substantially to 1.63 eV/atom
for the isosceles triangular Mn2As. The Mn-Mn dis-
tance, 2.59 ˚A, in Mn2As is almost equal to the Mn-Mn
distance in Mn2, 2.58 ˚A, and Mn-As-Mn bond angle is
found to be 680. As more Mn atoms are added, the
structures take three-dimensional shape, and the deter-
mination of ground state become a delicate task, as more
than one geometric and/or magnetic isomers, very close
in energy to the ground state are found, which will be
presented elsewhere in detail. As mentioned earlier, this
was done by minimizing the total energy of each clus-
ter with respect to all possible spin multiplicities for ev-
ery geometric structure studied. The presence of an As
atom makes Mn3As cluster tetrahedral, however, Mn4As
is a Mn4 tetrahedron with As at a face cap. Mn6As
is the only cluster whose geometry diﬀers signiﬁcantly
from a pure Mn6 cluster. Mn6 is octahedral, whereas
Mn6As is a pentagonal bipyramid, where the As atom
is trapped in the pentagonal ring. As x in MnxAs in-
creases, binding energy increases very slowly from 1.63
eV/atom for Mn2As and tends to saturate to a value
2.21 eV/atom for Mn10As (Fig.1(a)). The shortest Mn-
As bond length increases from 2.21 ˚A for MnAs to 2.46
˚A for Mn10As, which is 4% and 2% shorter than the
Mn-As distance in α-MnAs and Ga1−xMnxAs, respec-
tively, whereas the shortest Mn-Mn distance decreases
from 2.59 ˚A for Mn2As to 2.23 for Mn10As. Generally,
we ﬁnd the same trend as seen in the pure Mnx clusters
that the bonds between Mn atoms of opposite spin to be
somewhat shorter (2.20-2.60 ˚A) than the bonds between
Mn atoms of like spin (2.50-2.90 ˚A), whereas all Mn-As
distances vary between 2.20-2.60 ˚A. All the Mn-As-Mn
bond angles in these clusters vary in between ∼ 60-700.
All the clusters in the Fig.?? and their respective iso-
mers are magnetically stable i.e. both the spin gaps are
positive: the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the
minority (majority) spin lies above the highest occupied
molecular orbital of the majority (minority) spin. These
two spin gaps, δ1 and δ2 [15], for Mn2As (0.83 and 1.34
eV) and Mn4As (0.89 and 1.14 eV) are the highest among
all clusters. As x increases, δ1 and δ2 decrease to a value
0.47 and 0.35 eV, respectively, for Mn10As.

The next important issue is to see whether these Mn
clustering around single As are at all energetically favor-
able or not. To understand this point, we calculate two
diﬀerent energy gains, ∆1 - the energy gain in adding
an As atom to a Mnx cluster and ∆2 - the energy gain
in adding a Mn atom to a Mn1−xAs cluster. Fig.1(a)
shows that due to the lack of hybridization between the
4s and the 3d electrons binding energy of pure Mnx clus-
ters are very small. However, as an As atom is attached,
the 4s2 electrons of Mn interact with the 4p3 electrons of
As, which results in the substantial enhancement in the
bonding (Fig.1(a)), and consequently, ∆1 increases with
x, which ﬁnally tends to saturate (Fig.1(b)). ∆2 gives
the number that how many Mn atoms can be bonded to

a single As atom, which is still signiﬁcant, 2.65 eV, for
Mn10As. These behaviors of ∆1 and ∆2 indicate that the
Mn clusters around As are energetically favorable and we,
therefore, argue that they are, likely to be, present in the
low temperature MBE grown (GaMn)As/(InMn)As.

Now we ask the next and most important question that
what is the Mn-Mn magnetic coupling in these MnxAs
clusters? The total magnetic moments of MnxAs clus-
ters corresponding to the ground state geometries are
given in Table I. These large magnetic moments gen-
erally arise from the ferrimagnetic coupling between the
moments at Mn sites with the exceptions for Mn2As and
Mn4As, where the magnetic coupling is ferromagnetic.
We note, generally, no change in the nature of magnetic
coupling between the Mn sites in MnxAs clusters from
their respective pure Mnx. However, only for Mn3As,
the Mn-Mn coupling behavior changes form ferromag-
netic to ferrimagnetic, due to As doping, where a ferro-
magnetic tetrahedral structure with total moment 12 µB
is found to be 0.12 eV higher. The nature of the mag-
netic coupling is clear from their respective constant spin
density surfaces, which are plotted for Mn2As, Mn3As,
Mn4As and Mn8As in the Fig.??. The ground state mag-
netic moments of MnxAs, for x=1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10
can be represented as (µx − 1) µB, whereas for x=4 and
9, it can be expressed as (µx − 3) µB, where µx is the
total magnetic moment of the Mnx cluster correspond-
ing to the ground state or the ﬁrst isomer [1]. Local
magnetic moment, M , at each site can be calculated by
0 [ρ↑(r) − ρ↓(r)]dr, where ρ↑(r) and ρ↓(r) are up-
M = R
spin and down-spin charge densities, respectively, and R
[16] is the radius of a sphere centring the atom. For MnAs
dimer, the magnetic moment at Mn site, MMn, and at
As site, MAs, are 3.72 µB and −0.26 µB, respectively.
This large negative polarization of the anion, As, is due
to the strong p− d interaction. In the Mn2As cluster, Mn
atoms are ferromagnetically coupled with MMn=3.79 µB
each, whereas MAs is −0.14 µB. Mn atoms in the Mn3As
take frustrated antiferromagnetic structure with MMn =
3.1, 3.1 and −3.9 µB and MAs has a value −0.21 µB.
For Mn4As, Mn atoms are ferromagnetically arranged
(Fig.??) with an average MMn=3.66 µB and are coupled
antiferromagnetically with the As atom, MAs=−0.22 µB.
For Mn5As, MMn varies between 3.04-3.72 µB with a

R

local magnetic moment −0.23 µB at As site. Polarized
neutron diﬀraction study found a local magnetic moment
of −0.23 ± 0.05 µB at the As sites for NiAs-type MnAs
[17], which is very close to the present values for MnAs
- Mn5As clusters. These Mn-Mn magnetic behavior are
unlike the previous study of nitrogen-doped Mnx clus-
ters, x=1-5, by Rao and Jena [18], where Mn atoms were
found to be coupled ferromagnetically for all sizes. We
observe, the negative polarization of As, MAs, decreases
sharply to −0.08 µB for Mn6As and further decreases
monotonically to − 0.02 µB for Mn8As, however it be-
comes positive, 0.04 and 0.02, for Mn9As and Mn10As,
respectively. For all MnxAs clusters, x =6-10, Mn atoms
are coupled ferrimagnetically, and MMn of highly coor-
dinated atoms are very small than those of the surface
atoms and it varies between 0.8 - 3.7 µB.

In conclusion, though the As atom induces clustering of
Mn, the individual magnetic moments of Mn couple fer-
romagnetically only for Mn2As and Mn4As clusters and,
however, ferrimagnetically aligned for all other sizes. Not
only that, the ferromagnetic Mn2As and Mn4As are even
more stable than other sized ferrimagnetic clusters, as
they have largest spin gaps. We believe that Mn clus-
tering, during the low temperature MBE growth, could
be responsible for the ferromagnetism and reported high
Tc in (GaMn)As and should be taken into account to
formulate an adequate theory of ferromagnetism in III-
V semiconductors [19]. If Mn-doped GaAs, under care-
fully controlled growth and annealing condition, contains
Mn2As and/or Mn4As clusters, which have large cluster
magnetic moments, would enhance the local magnetic
moment and consequently could enhance Tc. On the
other hand, large clustering would yield low Tc due to
their small local magnetic moment. This study also sug-
gest that the similar mechanism could enhance the Tc
of (InMn)As and further investigation of Mn-clustering
around oxygen could explain the ferromagnetism and ob-
served high Tc of Mn-doped ZnO in the metastable phase
[20]. EXAFS studies would be very useful to see whether
these clusters of Mn around As are, indeed, present in
these samples and the gas phase experiments involving
Mn clustering in a As-seeded chamber can yield direct
information on the magnetic behavior of MnxAs clusters.
We hope, our study will encourage such experiments.

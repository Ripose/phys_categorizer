ABSTRACT

Properties of low-energy (infra-red) quadrupole modes (LEQM) of multipolarity λµ =20,

21 and 22 in deformed sodium clusters are studied within the Kohn-Sham LDA RPA ap-

proach. Possible manifestations of LEQM in stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)

reaction are discussed. It is shown that, in free light clusters, where the low-energy spectrum

is delute, LEQM can be unambiguously identiﬁed as particular electron-hole pairs. This gives

a chance to reconstruct the mean ﬁeld level scheme near the Fermi surface. Moreover, due

to the connection with electric λµ =21 mode, the scissors mode can be detected. In heavy

(supported) oblate clusters, LEQM are in general rather involved. Nevertheless, some inter-

esting λµ =21 and 22 structures determined by speciﬁc deformation eﬀects can be resolved.

The origin of the structures is discussed in detail.

INTRODUCTION

Collective oscillations of valence electrons in metal clusters manifest themselves in a

variety of electric and magnetic (orbital) plasmons (see [1] for review). Till now only the

electric dipole (E1) plasmon was thoroughly investigated [2]. Other plasmons were not

still observed and our knowledge about them is scares. At the same time, they promise

interesting physics and so devote careful study.

In the present paper, we consider low-energy electric quadrupole modes in axially de-

formed clusters. Quadrupole excitations of valence electrons in such clusters are collected
into bunches ∆N = 0 and 2, where N is the principle shell quantum number [3, 4]. The
low-energy bunch ∆N = 0 corresponds to E2 transitions inside the valence shell. It is clear

that this bunch exists only in clusters with partly occupied valence shell. Just these clusters
exhibit a non-spherical shape. The high-energy bunch ∆N = 2 corresponds to E2 transi-

tion through two shells. This bunch exists in clusters of any shape and exhausts most of
the quadrupole strength. Though the bunch ∆N = 2 shares the energy region with the

dominant E1 plasmon, it can be possibly observed by means of angular-resolved electron

energy-loss spectroscopy (AR-EELS) at electron scattering angles ∼ 6◦ [5].

In this paper, we will consider the low-energy quadrupole modes (LEQM) with ∆N = 0,

whose properties, by our knowledge, were never earlier investigated. We will show that

LEQM demonstrate spectacular structures connected with cluster deformation.

LEQM are probably too weak to be observed in AR-EELS but have a chance to be

detected in two-photon processes like Raman scattering (RS) or resonance ﬂuorescence (RF)

where the competition with E1 modes is completely excluded. These processes start from

excitation of an intermediate E1 electronic state (virtual or real). Then the coupling of the

intermediate and low-energy states results in the population of the latter, again through

E1 transitions (e.g., the electron-phonon coupling results in RS population of ionic phonon

states).

As far as we know, there was only one attempt to observe LEQM by RS in nanoparticles

[6]. In that experiment a broad bump was observed at ∼ 0.12 eV in supported silver clusters.

The electronic nature of the bump was justiﬁed by the inverse cluster size dependence of the

bump energy. Recent data of this group hint at the deformation dependence of the bump

energy [7]. Explanation of these data requests a strong theoretical support. Our study could

2

be a ﬁrst guide in this new ﬁeld.

Perhaps, a weak coupling of electron states does not favor their detection by RS. In this

connection, the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) seems to be more appro-

priate. This method uses partially overlapping pulses (from pump and Stokes lasers) to

produce complete population transfer between two quantum states |1 > and |3 > through

the intermediate state |2 > [12]. The combination of the pump and Stokes frequencies has

to be resonant with the two-photon Raman transition. In fact, the Stokes pulse plays the

same role as the coupling between the states |2 > and |3 > in RS.

LEQM seem to be most interesting in the cases of free light non-spherical clusters and

supported heavy oblate clusters. In free light clusters, the low-energy spectrum is very dilute

and thus LEQM can be safely resolved. We will show that LEQM can be unambiguously

identiﬁed as particular electron-hole (1eh) pairs involving the single-particle electron states

near the Fermi level. This allows to obtain, at least partly, the single-particle spectrum in

the clusters. Since this spectrum is sensitive to many factors (deformation, temperature,

inﬂuence of detailed ionic structure, ...), we thus handle the eﬀective method to study diverse

cluster’s properties. The spectrum can be also used as a robust test for theoretical models.

Besides, due to the connection between LEQM and scissors mode [8, 9, 10, 11], the latter

can be detected as well.

Heavy clusters in experiments are usually supported and range shapes from spherical to

strongly oblate [2]. Size and shape of supported clusters can be monitored [13]. If heavy

clusters are supported on dielectric (and porous) surfaces, then the interface eﬀect is mainly

reduced to shaping the cluster [2]. Such clusters can be simulated, in a ﬁrst approximation,

by free clusters at a certain oblate shape. In the present paper, we pretend only to a rough

estimation of LEQM properties and so this simulation is reasonable for our aims.

As a simplest case, we will consider sodium clusters. However, LEQM properties de-

scribed below are of a general character and so should also take place in other clusters

exhibiting quantum shells, e.g. in clusters of noble metals.

II. CALCULATION SCHEME

LEQM are described in the linear regime within the random-phase-approximation (RPA)

method [3, 4] based on the Kohn-Sham LDA functional [14]. The ions are treated in the soft

3

jellium approximation. High reliability of the method has been checked in diverse studies of

E1 plasmon in spherical [15] and deformed [4, 16] clusters.

We consider axial prolate Na+

quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations of Na+

15 as an example of a free light cluster. Equilibrium
15 (δ2 =0.57 and δ4 =-0.18) are deter-
mined by minimization of its total energy [4, 16]. The neutral Na118 at oblate deformations

δ2 =-0.3 and -0.5 is used as a simulation of heavy supported clusters.

STIRAP is treated as a resonance ﬂuorescence (RF) process running through λµ = 10

and 11 branches of the dipole plasmon, as intermediate states (see Fig. 1).

In strictly

deformed nuclei, where the branches are well separated by energy (see Figs. 2 and 3),

independent measurements through every branch are preferable. The population picture is

then simpler and allows easier interpretation. For example, if STIRAP runs only through

λµ = 10 plasmon branch, then the population of the low-energy quadrupole 22 mode is

forbidden and thus remaining 20 and 21 modes can be easier treated.

STIRAP population of LEQM is approximately calculated as a coherent sum of indepen-

dent two-step processes, every one being a product of dipole photoabsorption and emission:

σab
E1↑(0 → 1µ1i1) · σem

σ2µ2i2 = X
i1
ω1µ1i1| < Q1µ1i1|E1|0 > |2(ω1µ1i1 − ω2µ2i2)3| < Q2µ2i2|E1|Q†

E1↓(1µ1i1 → 2µ2i2)

1µ1i1 > |2.

(1)

⇒ X
i1

Here |1µ1i1 > and |2µ2i2 > are RPA states of the dipole plasmon and LEQM, respectively.

Index i runs all the RPA states of the given multipolarity in the chosen energy interval. The

operator of the dipole transition is electron-hole in the photoabsorption and electron-electron

(hole-hole) in the photoemission.

Eq. (1) follows from the general expression for RS cross-section [17] if one neglects the

interference between the neighbouring RPA states. This is the case for light clusters (see Fig.

2) but not for heavy ones whose spectrum is rather dense [4, 16]. However, the interference

mainly leads to smoothing the response, which can be taken into account by the reasonable

averaging the results.

In the present paper, we weight the low-energy responses by the

Lorentz function with the averaging parameter ∆ =0.1 eV. This should simulate both the

interference and temperature smoothing. We emphasize that the structures discussed below

are strong enough to be completely smoothed out and so the main conclusions of the present

study have to be valid in spite of the interference.

4

Spread of collective oscillations is known to increase with the excitation energy. So, for

the dipole plasmon which lies much higher than LEQM, we use the larger averaging with

∆ =0.25 eV. Such averaging was successfully used in our previous RPA calculations for the

photoabsorption [4, 15, 16].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Main results of the calculation are collected in Fig. 4. The ﬁrst line of the ﬁgure contains

photoabsorption for low-energy quadrupole states λµ =20, 21 and 22. Photoabsorption

is a useful step in any analysis of electron modes. The second line of Fig. 4 exhibits

photoabsorption for the scissors magnetic dipole mode. The next two lines provide the

STIRAP populations (1) for the cases when the reaction runs separately through λµ = 10

and λµ = 11 branches of the dipole plasmon (these cases are marked in Fig. 4 as RF E10

and RF E11, respectively).

In the energy intervals given in Fig. 4 (0-1.5 eV for Na+

15 and 0-1.0 eV for Na118), we take

into account all the quadrupole RPA states. As for the dipole intermediate RPA states used

in the STIRAP calculations, we involved all the states in Na+

15 and 40-50 of most collective

states in Na118, determined by the appropriate cut-oﬀ of the photoabsorption strength.

A. Light free clusters

The ﬁrst plot in the left column of Fig. 3 shows that LEQM photoabsorption in Na+

15 is

dominated by two λµ =21 peaks. Following the level scheme for Na+

15 given in Fig. 5, these

peaks can be associated with electron-hole pairs [211]-[202] and [211]-[200]. Our analysis

shows that i) collective shifts for these peaks are very small and ii) just the above 1eh

pairs provide dominant (up to 95%) contributions to the normalization conditions of the

peaks. This justiﬁes identiﬁcation of the peaks as [211]-[202] and [211]-[200] 1eh pairs. The

contributions into the optical response of other quadrupole modes, 20 and 21, given in Fig.

5 is negligible because of low values of their transition single-particle matrix elements.

Both [211]-[202] and [211]-[200] 1eh pairs include the Fermi level [211] whose energy can

be obtained from the ionization potential data. Then one immediately gets the energies

of electron levels [202] and [200]. So, STIRAP measurements together with other data

5

(ionization potential, photoemission data, etc) allow to obtain the single-particle spectrum

in light deformed clusters. Since this spectrum is sensitive to many factors (deformation,

temperature, inﬂuence of detailed ionic structure, ...), we can use it to study diverse cluster’s

properties. Beside, the spectrum can serve as a robust test for theoretical models.

The next plot for Na+

15 exhibits the photoabsorption cross section for the scissors mode.

We see again two peaks corresponding to [211]-[202] and [211]-[200] states discussed above.

While the lower state [211]-[202] favors the M1 response, the higher state [211]-[200] responds

mainly to E21 ﬁeld. Both photoabsorption plots display a close connection (coupling) be-

tween the scissors M1 and quadrupole E21 modes. The modes are characterized by one and

the same set of 1eh pairs with quantum numbers Λπ = 1+ (where Λ is the projection of the

orbital moment to the symmetry axis z and π is the space parity of the state). The coupling

of electric and magnetic modes with the same quantum numbers Λπ is a general feature of

deformed quantum systems. For example, this feature is well known in atomic nuclei [19].

In fact, both scissors M1 and quadrupole E21 modes represent one and the same intrinsic

electron motion in a deformed cluster. The scissors mode is more speciﬁc, while the E21

mode is more general. To illustrate this point, we expand the single-particle wave functions

in a deformed mean ﬁeld in terms of the spherical basis (nLΛ)

(2)

nLRnL(r)YLΛ(Ω).

This allows to evaluate the single-particle orbital M1 transition amplitude between hole

(ν = h) and particle (ν = p) states

hΨp| ˆLx|Ψhi ∝ δπp,πhδΛp,Λh±1 X

ap
nLah

nLpL(L+1)−Λh(Λh±1).

Eq.

(3) shows that the scissors mode is generated by Λp = Λh ± 1 transitions between

the components of one and the same spherical (nL)-level. Such selectivity is explained by
the fact that the scissors operators, ˆLx and ˆLy, do not depend on the space coordinate

r and so, due to orthogonality of the radial wave functions RnL(r), cannot connect the

components originating from diﬀerent (nL)-subshells.

Instead, the quadrupole operator

r2Y21 does connect the components with diﬀerent (nL). So, the scissors operators are more
selective than the E21 operator. Every Λπ = 1+ state responds to both M1 and E21 external

ﬁelds. Magnitudes of the responses depend on the wave function of the state.

The third and forth plots show STIRAP populations when the reaction runs through

λµ = 10 and λµ = 11 branches of the dipole plasmon (RF E10 and E11 cases, respectively).

Like in the photoabsorptions, λµ = 21 mode dominates over 20 and 22. In RF E10 case,

the populations of both [211]-[202] and [211]-[200] 1eh states are equally strong. Detection

of these states provides energies of electron levels [202] and [200]. Besides, the scissors mode

associated with the state [211]-202] can be observed. In RF E11 case, only [211]-[200] 1eh

state is well populated. The diﬀerences between RF E10 and E11 cases can be of use (for

example, to distinguish [211]-[202] and [211]-[200] 1eh states).

B. Heavy oblate supported clusters

The low-energy spectrum in heavy clusters is expected to be involved. In general, this is

indeed the case. However, as is seen from Fig. 4 (second and third columns), the picture

essentially depends on the reaction. Some responses reveal pronounced structures. We will

analyse these structures by using Fig. 5 as a guide. Though Fig. 5 shows the level scheme

for the small cluster, it hints the principle trends.

The ﬁrst line of Fig. 4 displays the quadrupole photoabsorption. We see bunching of the

strength at 0.5-1.0 eV. The bunching involves two kinds of quadrupole transitions: i) between

neighbouring subshells (like E20([220]-[200]) in Fig. 5) and ii) inside the valence subshell

(like E22([220]-[202]) in Fig. 5). The second line of Fig. 4 exposes photoabsorption for the

scissors mode. The scissors peak rises and blue-shifts with the deformation. Unfortunately,

both LEQM and scissors modes cannot be detected in photoabsorption and their plots are

given here mainly for better understanding of the subsequent STIRAP results.

The RF E10 plots demonstrate the overwhelming dominance of λµ = 21 mode over

20. This can be explained by statistical arguments. First, the mode λµ = 21 covers two

projections µ = ±1 instead of one in λµ = 20. Second, the mode λµ = 21 usually has much

more transition single-particle matrix elements than 20.

The RF E10 response is presented by two distinct peaks. The ﬁrst one originates from

the deformation splitting (like E21([211]-[202]) in Fig. 5) and exhibits a blue-shift with

increasing |δ2|. This peak is not seen in E2 photoabsorption. At the same time, it displays

the correlation with the scissors mode. The second peak at ∼ 0.6 − 0.7 eV is mainly

determined by E21 transitions between neighbouring subshells (like E21([211]-[200]) in Fig.

7

5) and its energy does not depend on the deformation.

In RF E11 case, the mode 22 comes to play. The response is entangled at δ2 = −0.3

but exhibits a pronounced low-energy (∼ 0.1 eV) λµ =22 structure at δ2 = −0.5. For

the ﬁrst glance, this structure looks puzzling since it cannot be explained by any option

discussed above. Indeed, its energy does not visibly depend on the deformation splitting

(like E22([220]-[202] in Fig. 5 or 22 bump in Fig. 4, ﬁrst line). It also has too low energy to

be explained by transitions between the neighbouring subshells. Our analysis has revealed

very speciﬁc origin of this structure. It is explained in Fig. 6 as a result of bunching [NnzΛ]

levels with the same nz (see E22 transitions [523] → [521] and [532] → [530]). The bunching

signiﬁes that in large systems with strong deformation the asymptotic Nilsson-Clemenger

quantum number nz (number of quants along the symmetry axis z) becomes exact.

C. STIRAP discussion

Some essential points concerning detection of LEQM in STIRAP should be commented.

The lifetime of the dipole plasmon is mainly determined by the Landau fragmentation

while the radiative decay of the plasmon usually plays a minor role. The advantage of the

STIRAP is that it strongly enhances the population of the desirable low-energy states in

spite of a weak natural radiative decay to them from intermediate states.

To distinguish in STIRAP the electron LEQM from possible excitations of other na-

ture (contributions of impurities, ionic modes, etc), one can use the feature of electronic

excitations to exhibit the inverse dependence of their energy on cluster size.

It worth noting that STIRAP deals with both free and supported systems [12].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The properties of the low-energy quadrupole modes (LEQM) in deformed clusters were

analysed within the Kohn-Sham LDA RPA approach. The stimulated Raman adiabatic pas-

sage (STIRAP) was considered as the most suitable experimental method to detect LEQM.

The population of the LEQM in STIRAP was calculated for two special cases:

free light

deformed clusters and supported heavy strongly-oblate clusters. In the ﬁrst case, LEQM

spectrum is dilute and can be resolved in STIRAP. The spectrum is easily associated with

8

particular electron-hole pairs. This ﬁnally allows to determine the single-particle energies

near the Fermi level. Besides, close connection between the λµ =21 and scissors modes

allows to observe the latter.

In heavy clusters, STIRAP population through the λµ = 10 branch of the dipole plasmon

is strictly dominated by two λµ =21 peaks. The nature of the peaks is explained. In the

population through the λµ = 11 branch, the soft λµ =22 mode devotes a special attention.

It originates from the fact that in large systems with strong deformation the asymptotic

Nilsson-Clemenger quantum number nz becomes exact.

It worth noting, that the LEQM properties described above are of a general character and

so should take place not only in sodium clusters considered here but also in other clusters

with quantum shells, for example in clusters of noble metals. Since any other information

on electron LEQM in deformed clusters is absent, our study can be used as a ﬁrst guide in

the ﬁeld.

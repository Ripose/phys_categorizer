Abstract

We report on results of a theoretical study of the adsorption process of a single carbon oxide

molecule on a Platinum (111) surface. A four-component relativistic density functional method was

applied to account for a proper description of the strong relativistic eﬀects. A limited number of

atoms in the framework of a cluster approach is used to describe the surface. Diﬀerent adsorption

sites are investigated. We found that CO is preferably adsorbed at the top position.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction between atoms and surfaces is essential to understand adsorption pro-

cesses. In order to determine accurate structures, vibration frequencies, electronic properties

and forces ab initio calculations are indispensable. Density functional theory (DFT) nowa-

days provides a powerful tool in nearly all branches of fundamental research in microscopic

regimes (see e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4]). It also facilitates a detailed theoretical investigation of prob-

lems in surface physics and catalysis on a quantum-chemical level of theory [5], particularly

the adsorption process of ad atoms on surfaces within the framework of a molecular orbital

picture. Due to the adsorption process on the surface the translation symmetry parallel to

the surface is violated. From a strict theoretical point of view methods of solid state physics

are no longer applicable for this problem. In order to treat such systems approximately one

can use two diﬀerent approaches; one is the solid state method using super cells or a slab

model, and the other is the molecular method using clusters. As the size of the super cell or

cluster increases, both methods should converge and yield the correct experimental value. In

this paper we follow the molecular approach in which the physical system is approximated

by a big molecule or cluster. Results of ab initio calculations are comparable with experi-

mental results for small molecular systems and/or clusters. Such a cluster model is of course

only an approximation for the description of unlimited surfaces and solids. Nevertheless, as

long as the physical process which we are going to describe is strongly localized, a cluster

scheme may be an appropriate description. The adsorption process of a single atom or a

simple molecule is considered to be such a local eﬀect.

One of the most extensively studied systems in this respect is the adsorption of carbon

oxide (CO) on a Platinum surface. However, no good quantitative description has been

achieved so far. The reason might be the lack of a proper description of the strong relativistic

eﬀects resulting from the 5d band of Pt, which lead to a diﬀerent behaviour in the presence

of Pt than on the surfaces of the homologue elements Ni and Pd [6].

We have already tested this cluster approach on simpler systems successfully. The ad-

sorption of a single Na and Ba atom at the Na(110) and the Ba(110) surface, respectively,

have been studied [7]. The results were reasonable and encouraged us to apply our method

to the more complex system widely used in catalytic processes: the adsorption of CO on a

Pt(111) surface.

2

In this paper we present the results of four-component relativistic density functional

calculations for the adsorption of CO on a Pt(111) surface. Recently, our computer code

has been developed to a new quality which allows to calculate fragmentation energies and

geometries of bigger clusters with local and semi-local density functionals. Compared with

scalar relativistic approaches, the spin-orbit coupling is fully included in our formalism.

II. WHAT IS KNOWN FOR THE SYSTEM CO AT PT(111) SO FAR?

The adsorption of CO at a platinum surface seems to be one of the most analyzed ex-

perimental systems. Apai et al. [8] showed that the CO molecule is adsorbed linearly with

the C bonding towards the surface which can be explained by the fact that the HOMO

(5σ) and LUMO (2π∗) of the CO are located at the C atom. So this site is preferred for

a binding with a surface. The molecule does not dissociate after adsorption and the main

part of the binding is dominated by the d band of the platinum surface. The CO remains

to be eﬀectively neutral.

A theoretical explanation of the binding formalism was given by Blyholder [9]. He studied

the binding of CO at metallic surfaces by using a H¨uckel method. Within this framework

the results show a formal charge transfer from the bonding 5σ orbital of the CO towards the

metal. On the other hand there is a charge back transfer from the metal towards the anti

bonding 2π∗ of the molecule. This exchange of charge explains the fact that the molecule is

still neutral after adsorption.

With this theory one is able to distinguish the adsorption site at the surface by the

vibrational frequencies of the adsorbed molecule: Eﬀectively there is a charge transfer in

the molecule from the bonding 5σ to the anti bonding 2π∗ orbitals. The occupation of

the anti bonding orbital leads to a reduced electronic charge between the C and O atom.

This results in a weakening of the bonding, and therefore the vibrational frequency of the

adsorbed molecule is lowered. The strength of this eﬀect depends on the adsorption site. A

molecule adsorbed at a hollow position has a stronger overlap between the metal band and

the 2π∗ orbital than at a top position. This is due to the fact that the molecule is closer

to the surface. Therefore the frequencies are lower at hollow positions and one is able to

distinguish the adsorption sites [9, 10].

Ertl et al.

[11] reported their results of the adsorption of CO at the Pt(111) surface.

3

They stated that the strongest bonding arises at a hollow position which they erroneously

explained by the knowledge of similar systems like Ni and Pd. With higher coverage the

bridge position is occupied building a

(3) ×

(3)/R30◦ overlay structure. In the regime

of zero coverage they estimated the binding energy to be 1.43 ± 0.04 eV . In the following

p

p

years a lot of experimental papers appeared, discussing the binding energy in this limit of

low coverage. The preferred adsorption site is now assumed to be the top position followed

by the bridge position [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The results show an adsorption energy

of 1.3 to 1.6 eV . All these results have one thing in common: The adsorption energy is

calculated via the modiﬁed Clausius–Clapeyron formula of thermodynamics: Pressure and

temperature are varied whereas the coverage is kept constant which is monitored by the

change of the work function. The resulting curve is a measure for the adsorption energy.

The adsorbed molecules form a dipole layer on the surface resulting in a change of the work

function which is proportional to the coverage. In the regime of low coverage this assumption

may not be valid.

Newer results of Yeo et al.

[20] show a signiﬁcantly stronger binding energy of 1.89 ±

0.20 eV at low coverage. They used the new Single Crystal Adsorption Calorimetry (SCAC)

method which allows the direct measurement of the IR-photon emitted during adsorption.

Somorjai et al. were able to estimate the binding distances of the adsorbed molecules.
They found a distance of 1.85±0.1 ˚A between the C atom and the surface at the top position
and a value of 1.55 ± 0.07 ˚A at the bridge position. The bridge position was observed at a
coverage of 1
3. The binding distance within the CO molecule after adsorption is measured
to be 1.15 ± 0.05 ˚A [21, 22]. This is a small elongation of the intra-molecular distance. The
free CO molecule has a value of 1.12 ˚A [23].

On the theoretical side there are a lot of diﬀerent approaches in the estimation of the

binding energy. Most of them use a cluster approach [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,

33] with diﬀerent methods like modiﬁed H¨uckel methods or pseudopotentials and diﬀerent

numbers of atoms. Some [27, 28, 29, 30] used only 1-2 atoms for the simulation of the

surface. The estimated binding energies at the top position are between 0.19 eV and 4.21 eV

reﬂecting the fact that non-relativistic pseudo-potential or H¨uckel models are not able to

give reliable results for the adsorption energy. The main reason for this seems to be the lack

of reproducing a good behavior of the d orbitals and therefore the d band of Pt. Models

with less than 10 atoms in the cluster will probably only lead by chance to good results. The

4

Atom Superposition and Electron Delocalization model from Ray and Anderson [25] based

on extended H¨uckel method combined with atomic one particle energies and atom–atom

repulsion, on the other hand, leads to acceptable results with a binding energy of 1.66 eV

for the top, 1.26 eV for the bridge and 1.11 eV for the fcc hollow position followed by 1.03

eV for the hcp hollow position. Thus the fcc hollow position is slightly preferred among the

both possible hollow positions.

Other authors used slab models [34, 35, 36] or a super-cell model [37]. However, all these

methods were not applied in the regime of low coverage. They work with an eﬀective coverage
between 1

3. At these coverages the lateral interactions of the adsorbed molecules are
not negligible. Yeo et al. [20] showed a decrease of the energy by 0.2 − 0.4 eV within this

4 and 1

regime. Thus the results they get are in good agreement with experimental results but are

not valid at low coverage.

Brako et al.

studied the on-top chemisorption of CO molecules as a function of the

coverage and the lateral relaxation of the platinum surface using a classical Hamiltonian

with an analytical model potential [38].

III. THE THEORETICAL METHOD

We all know that an exact solution of the relativistic many–particle Dirac equation is

not possible. Large-scale multi-conﬁguration or coupled cluster approaches are the best

approximations for atoms so far. This high quality relativistic calculations are not yet

possible for more than diatomic molecules.

For the size of systems we are discussing here only relativistic pseudo-potential or density

functional calculations are available. The code which we are using [39] has its ﬁrst roots

in the relativistic version of the DVM approach [40]. Although the general structure of the

density functional code has been described in several publications we nevertheless repeat it

here in short because a number of details have been modiﬁed.

Following the Hohenberg–Kohn [41] and Kohn–Sham theorems [42] and starting from

the no-pair approximation [43] and also neglecting the minor important contributions from
spatial components of the four-current jv(~r) = (j0,~j), the total energy (in atomic units)

For the self-consistent solution of equation (3.3) we use the relativistic local density

approximation [44, 45] (RLDA) together with the Vosko, Wilk and Nusair parameterization

[46] for correlation. Nonlocal corrections, with the relativistic form (RGGA) [47] of Becke’s

GGA approximation[48] for exchange and Perdew functional of correlation [49] (B88/P86)is

used perturbatively. Optionally we also have a relativistic extension of Perdew and Wang

[50] (PW91) for the xc-energy. The Coulomb potential V C(~r) is given by

Numerical evaluation of the Coulomb matrix elements requires the evaluation of the Coulomb
potential at the grid points, which leads to a large number (n2p; n: number of basis functions,

p: number of grid points) of nuclear attraction type integrals. It is possible to facilitate the
n2p problem by approximating the exact density with an expansion in one center ﬁt functions

For simpler molecules, that means without complex density structure, it was suﬃcient to

use only the monopole part of the atomic wave functions to build the approximate density.

With the open d shell of Pt it is necessary to use higher moments in the expansion (3.7).

Actually we use values up to l = 2. Using this procedure the least square value of eqn. (3.8)

was less than 5%.

In order to solve the Kohn-Sham equations (3.3) we use the Molecular-Orbital Linear

Combination of Atomic Orbitals (MO-LCAO)-method and expand the molecular orbital

wave functions in symmetry–adapted wave function χj, which themselves are expanded in

atomic orbitals χnν (~r) which are atomic four–component Dirac–Spinors[52, 53]

(3.10)

(3.11)

with nν = (ν, n, κ, m). Here χnν (~r) are the relativistic four–component atomic basis func-

tions centered at the atoms. Using this symmetry adapted atomic basis set implies the

non pair approximation [43]. The symmetry coeﬃcients dnν j are calculated by the program

Xj

Xnν

7

TSYM of Meyer [52, 53]. The expansion coeﬃcients cij of the molecular wave functions

together with the one-particle energies ǫi are the results of the SCF calculation of equation

(3.3). Inserting (3.10) into (3.3) gives the matrix secular equation in the symmetry orbital

basis χ,

HC = εSC

(3.12)

where H and S are the Hamiltonian and overlap matrices respectively, C is the coeﬃcient-

matrix (cij) and ε is the eigenvalue-vector (εi). The matrix elements, Hij and Sij are

evaluated numerically using the multi-center integration scheme by Baerends et al. [54, 55].

In this scheme the whole molecular volume is spatially partitioned into so called Voronoi cells

and each cell is divided into an atomic sphere around the atomic nucleus and polyhedra. This

method was extended by a special transformation to account for the relativistic behavior of

the wave function near the nuclei [39].

IV. THE FROZEN–CORE APPROXIMATION

In order to reduce the computational requirement one very popular way is to use either

pseudopotentials or the Frozen Core approximation (FCA). Both approximations are based

on the idea that chemical binding is realized via the outer valence orbitals only.

In our

calculations we used the Frozen Core Approximation. In FCA it is assumed that the inner

orbitals do not change their form during the adsorption process so that they can be kept

ﬁxed in the self consistence procedure. This reduces the numerical eﬀort for the heavier

elements like Pt drastically.

Since the FCA is a very popular approximation and used in almost all kinds of ab ini-

tio calculations (from density functional to quantum chemical methods) there are many

references in the literature [56, 57, 58] for this method.

Although the principal procedure of the FCA in all ab initio methods is the same, there

are diﬀerences in practical implementations. Therefore we give a short summary of the

FCA in our code. Compared with all electron calculations there are two diﬀerences in

FC calculations: the orthogonalization of the valence orbitals to the core orbitals and the

calculation of the total energy.

The FCA is based on a decomposition of the Hilbert space into a core (c) and a valence

8

(v) part. Accordingly, the molecular wave functions can be written as:

|ψi = |ψvi + |ψci.

In order to ensure the constrained Ritz variation of the valence orbitals, a core-valence or-

thogonalization has to be carried out. In our implementation we followed the idea of the

normalization of the overlap matrix in the core-valence orthogonalization. The decomposi-

tion of the Hilbert space results in the decomposition of the overlap and Fock matrices into

core-core, core-valence and valence-valence parts which have to be orthogonalized to each

other.

In order to ensure the core-valence orthogonalization all contributions of core orbitals are

removed from the valence orbitals. This is achieved by the explicit orthogonalization of the

valence orbitals onto the core orbitals.

|χ′

vi = |χvi − Svc S−1

cc |χci.

Here Svc is the valence–core overlap matrix. As a result the transformed overlap and Fock

matrices of the whole system are now of the form:

(4.1)

}

We assume that the core orbitals of diﬀerent atoms do not overlap. By the use of atomic

orbitals the core orbitals of the same atom are by default orthogonal. Therefore the corre-

sponding symmetry orbitals are also orthonormal and Scc = 1.

Due to the chemical binding the relative change in the core potential is small. The change

in the core wave functions which is a second order eﬀect can therefore be neglected. This

means that H ′

vc in eqn. (4.1) can be neglected. As a result of this approximation the secular

equation (3.12) decouples into two equations, which are solved like all electron calculations.

Both approximations deﬁne our implementation of FCA.

The symbols with a small v represent atomic potentials. The subindices c and v mean

that the core and valence densities are used to calculate the potentials. The ﬁrst two lines

of equation (4.2) consist of pure atomic contributions. As far as we do not change the

basis functions these values can be neglected as long as we are only interested in binding

energies and distances.

In this case these core contributions cancel completely out. The

third line describes only the core–core interactions of diﬀerent atoms. These values can be

The last two lines are exactly the same as in the total energy expression in an all electron

still need the full density ρ = ρc + ρv.

V. RESULTS

Our aim in this paper is the ab initio calculation of the adsorption of CO at Pt(111)

surface. This process is one of the most frequently used catalytic processes but is not

10

understood in detail up to now. We have referred to the experimental ﬁndings and theoretical

methods which were applied up to now in section II.

As Pt is a very heavy metal where relativistic eﬀects play an important role we at least

have the appropriate method. Unfortunately the computational eﬀort restricts the actual

calculations to a very limited number of Pt atoms which can be used in a real calculation.

Nevertheless we have achieved to converge clusters between 7 and 13 Pt atoms depending

on the adsorption site of the CO molecule. To keep the calculation time in an acceptable

range, we in addition used only a quasi minimal basis set which was optimized via the degree

of ionization of the atomic wave functions used as basis functions. For Pt we use the 1s

to 6p wave functions with a degree of ionization of +0.2. As an eﬀect this leads to valence

functions which are slightly more localized than the neutral ones but are more suitable to

reproduce the binding character of the bulk. For the wave functions with the main quantum

numbers n=1 to 4 in addition the FCA was used.

A. The CO molecule

For the calculation of the CO molecule a larger basis set was used. This system requires

a very good basis to account for the strong chemical bonding and charge distribution within

this molecule.

in the SCF process.

The best results for the CO molecule were obtained with a minimal basis set consisting

of the 1s − 2p wave functions of the neutral atoms in combination with additional 3p, 3d

wave functions with an degree of ionization of +4.0. In this molecule all electrons were used

Table I shows the results for the CO molecule, which are close to the experimental data.

The negative value of the dipole moment indicates a major negative charge at the C atom.

The binding energy is slightly too high, which may be attributed to an unpolarized treatment

because current-dependent functionals are not available.

B. The adsorption calculations

In order to calculate the adsorption energy of CO on the Pt(111) surface one ﬁrst has

to deﬁne the clusters which simulate the surface for the four possible adsorption sites of

11

the CO molecule. The internuclear axis of the CO molecule is assumed to be perpendicular

to the surface with C towards the surface. The four possible adsorption sites are the top,

bridge, fcc–hollow and hcp–hollow of the (111) surface of Pt. The diﬀerent adsorption sites

are shown in Figures 1 to 4. As insert in the ﬁgures 1 to 4 we present the Pt–clusters as

molecular models in the view from above and in a perspective view for the four adsorption

sites. The CO molecule can also be seen. The distances between the Pt atoms are kept ﬁxed
to their bulk values (a0 = 3.92 ˚A) and the CO distance to the value calculated above.

In the cases of top and the hollow positions the C3v symmetry was utilized. For the

bridge position only a C1h symmetry can be used. Figures 1 to 4 show the results of the

calculations. Because of the low symmetry of the bridge position a maximum of 7 atoms had

to be used to get results in a realistic calculation time. The notation Ptm+n(m, n) denotes

the number of atoms per layer: m atoms in the ﬁrst layer and n in the second resulting

in m + n total Pt atoms. The bulk was represented only by two layers. As shown in the

literature, this number of layers seems to be necessary and nearly suﬃcient [60, 61, 62].

Results of our calculations for binding of the CO molecule on the four surfaces are given

in Tables II–IV for the GGA calculations according to Becke 1988 [48] in combination with

Perdew 1986 [49] (which in short term notation is B88/P86).

The results show the experimentally observed binding order with the top position as the

strongest one and therefore as the preferred adsorption site. Like Ray and Anderson [25] we

also ﬁnd a slight preference of the fcc position in the hollow positions.

Within our method the binding energies are by about 10 − 20% too high compared with

experimental results (see for instance the results of the CO molecule). Having this in mind

our results of 2.3 eV binding energy at the top position compares well with the measured

value of 1.86 ± 0.20 eV of Yeo et al.

[20] (see table II). A direct comparison of binding

energies at other positions with experimental results is not available. The calculations here

were performed with a single CO molecule only. In experiments an occupation of the other

adsorption sites is only observed at much higher coverages which are not considered here.

In Table III the calculated bond distances of the C atom (of the CO molecule) with

respect to the surface at the energy minimum at the four possible adsorption sites are listed.

In addition very informative is Table IV. Here the distances are calculated towards

the next Pt atom of the surface for all four CO positions. For better comparison with the
experimental results these values are converted to ˚A. These results correlate with the binding

12

behaviour. The distance at top position is the shortest whereas the hollow positions have

the greatest distances. A comparison with the experimental values shows a good agreement

for the top position as well as the bridge position where our value is slightly shorter than the

experimental value. One reason for this may lie in the eﬀective coverage when the bridge

position is experimentally observed. As already mentioned, the interactions of the adsorbed

CO molecules are not negligible [24] within this coverage.

Table V presents a comparison of our values for the top–position with other theoretical

results. These values demonstrate that the bond energies still do scatter up to 1 eV. The

same applies for the various theoretical results for the hollow–position in Table VI.

Table VII shows the electronic charge distribution of the CO molecule as a result of a

Mulliken population analysis of our calculations. The charge of the oxygen atom remains

more or less constant and independent of the adsorption process and adsorption site whereas

the carbon atom changes its charge by small amounts. A more detailed analysis of the

electronic charge distribution shows that the charge between the two atoms C and O is

reduced in the direction oﬀ the molecular axis.

It is further interesting to see that the CO molecule as a whole has almost no charge

transfer at the top position which has the strongest binding whereas all three other positions

show a negative charge transfer from the cluster to the molecule of nearly half an electron.

In addition we studied the eﬀect of elongation of the CO distance on the top–position

adsorption site. As a result we found only a very small elongation of 0.01−0.02 a.u. compared

with the free molecule.

VI. CONCLUSION

Using a cluster approach within a relativistic density functional approximation as de-

scribed above, we get results for the adsorption of the CO molecule on the Pt(111) surface

which are reasonably good. This statement in itself is very remarkable although we must

admit that we are not able to show the convergence of these results with cluster size here.

For one of the positions we have been able to include more Pt atoms in the cluster and

in fact, the binding energy did not change any more. As expected, the binding energy is

slightly higher than the experimental value of Yeo et al. [20].

Finally we note that the used method is able to describe the adsorption process. We are

13

able to calculate this important system with a quasi ab initio method (the only experimental

result used in the calculation is the structure of the bulk) in a fully relativistic framework.

In our calculations all relativistic d orbitals of Pt are treated dynamically.

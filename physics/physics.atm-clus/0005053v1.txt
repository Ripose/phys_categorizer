The melting-like transition in potasium clusters KN , with N=20, 55, 92 and 142, is studied by
using an orbital-free density-functional constant-energy molecular dynamics simulation method,
and compared to previous theoretical results on the melting-like transition in sodium clusters of the
same sizes. Melting in potasium and sodium clusters proceeds in a similar way: a surface melting
stage develops upon heating before the homogeneous melting temperature is reached. Premelting
eﬀects are nevertheless more important and more easily established in potasium clusters, and the
transition regions spread over temperature intervals which are wider than in the case of sodium. For
all the sizes considered, the percentage melting temperature reduction when passing from Na to K
clusters is substantially larger than in the bulk. Once those two materials have been compared for a
number of diﬀerent cluster sizes, we study the melting-like transition in Rb55 and Cs55 clusters and
make a comparison with the melting behavior of Na55 and K55. As the atomic number increases,
the height of the speciﬁc heat peaks decreases, their width increases, and the melting temperature
decreases as in bulk melting, but in a more pronounced way.

I. INTRODUCTION

The melting transition of a pure bulk material occurs
at a well deﬁned temperature for a given external pres-
sure. The melting-like transition in small clusters com-
posed of a ﬁnite number of atoms spreads instead over a
temperature interval that widens as the cluster size de-
creases. A number of thermal properties sensitive to the
cluster size and essentially diﬀerent from those found in
bulk materials emerge in the transition region deﬁned by
that temperature interval, which has motivated a lot of
theoretical1–8 and experimental9–12 investigations. The
experiments of Schmidt et al.10 have shown strong non-
monotonic variations of the melting temperature of free
sodium clusters with size, which can not be completely
explained either by electronic or geometric shell closing
arguments. The theoretical simulations have predicted
the occurrence of several premelting eﬀects, like surface
melting or structural isomerizations, and also the exis-
tence of a dynamic coexistence regime, where the cluster
can ﬂuctuate in time between being completely solid or
liquid.

We have previously reported density functional
orbital-free molecular dynamics (OFMD) simulations
of the melting process in sodium clusters NaN , with
N=8,20,55,92, and 142.7,8 The OFMD technique13 is
completely analogous to the method devised by Car and
Parrinello (CP) to perform dynamic simulations at an
ab initio level,14 but the electron density is taken as the
dynamic variable,15 as opposed to the Kohn-Sham (KS)
orbitals16 in the original CP method. This technique,
whose main advantage over KS-based methods is that
the computational eﬀort to update the electronic sys-
tem scales linearly with cluster size, has been already
used both in solid state17,18 and cluster3,19,20 physics.

Our predictions of the temperatures at which homoge-
neous cluster melting occurs were in good agreement with
the experiments of Haberland’s group,10,11 excepting the
enhancement of the melting temperature around N=55,
which was not reproduced. We also observed a number of
interesting premelting eﬀects, mostly the establishment
of a surface melting stage at a temperature lower than the
homogeneous melting temperature for Na20, Na92 and
Na142, and several isomerization transitions in Na8 and
Na20. It is interesting to study similar systems like clus-
ters of K, Rb and Cs in order to assess whether those
trends are a general feature of alkali clusters or not. With
this goal, we consider in this paper the melting-like tran-
sition of KN clusters, with N=20, 55, 92, and 142, and
compare it with that of sodium clusters of the same size.
As a second step, for a ﬁxed cluster size of N=55, we
study the melting behavior of Rb55 and Cs55 and com-
pare it with that of Na55 and K55. In the next section we
brieﬂy present some technical details of the method. The
results are presented and discussed in section III and, ﬁ-
nally, section IV summarizes our main conclusions.

II. THEORY

The orbital-free molecular dynamics method is a Car-
Parrinello total energy scheme14 which uses an explicit
kinetic-energy functional of the electron density, and has
the electron density as the dynamical variable, as op-
posed to the KS single particle wavefunctions. The
main features of the energy functional and the calcu-
lation scheme have been described at length in previ-
ous work,13,17,19,3,7 and details of our method are as
described by Aguado et al.7 In brief, the electronic ki-
netic energy functional of the electron density, n(~r), cor-

and the second is the lowest order gradient correction,
where TW , the von Weizs¨acker term, is given by

starting geometry for the next run at a diﬀerent energy.
The initial velocities for every new run were obtained
by scaling the ﬁnal velocities of the preceding run. The
total simulation times for each run at constant energy
were 40 ps for K clusters. 80 ps for Rb55, and 140 ps for
Cs55. These diﬀerent simulation times were chosen in or-
der to obtain a good convergence of the several melting
indicators described below. They increase with atomic
number because the typical atomic vibrational frecuen-
cies decrease with atomic number.

A number of indicators to locate the melting-like tran-
sition were employed. Namely, the speciﬁc heat deﬁned

The local density approximation is used for exchange and
correlation.24,25 In the external ﬁeld acting on the elec-

trons, Vext(~r) = Pn v(~r − ~Rn), we take v to be the lo-

cal pseudopotential of Fiolhais et al.,26 which reproduces
well the properties of bulk alkalis and has been shown to
have good transferability to alkali clusters.27 The clus-
ter is placed in a unit cell of a cubic superlattice, and
the set of plane waves periodic in the superlattice is used
as a basis set to expand the valence density. Following
Car and Parrinello,14 the coeﬃcients of that expansion
are regarded as generalized coordinates of a set of ﬁcti-
tious classical particles, and the corresponding Lagrange
equations of motion for the ions and the electron density
distribution are solved as described in Ref. 7.

The calculations used a supercell of edge 71 a.u.

K20 and 81 a.u.
An energy cut-oﬀ of 8 Ryd was used in the plane wave
expansion of the energy for K clusters, and of 6.15 Ryd
for Rb and Cs clusters. In all cases, a 64×64×64 grid
was used. The cut-oﬀs used give a convergence of bond
lengths and binding energies as good as that obtained
for sodium clusters.7 The ﬁctitious mass associated with
the electron density coeﬃcients ranged between 6.3×108
and 4.0×109 a.u., depending on the material and on the
temperature of the simulations. The equations of motion
of K clusters were integrated using the Verlet algorithm28
for both electrons and ions with a time step ranging from
∆t = 0.83 × 10−15 sec. for the simulations performed at
the lowest temperatures, to ∆t = 0.67 × 10−15 sec. for
those at the highest ones. In the case of Rb55 the time
steps ranged from ∆t = 2.38 × 10−15 sec. to ∆t = 1.31
× 10−15 sec, and in the case of Cs55 from ∆t = 4.29
× 10−15 sec. to ∆t = 1.79 × 10−15 sec. These choices
resulted in a conservation of the total energy better than
0.1 % in all cases.

Several molecular dynamics simulation runs at diﬀer-
ent constant energies were performed in order to obtain
the caloric curve for each cluster. The initial positions
of the atoms for the ﬁrst run were taken by slightly de-
forming the equilibrium low-temperature geometry of the
cluster. The ﬁnal conﬁguration of each run served as the

III. RESULTS

A very important issue in the simulations of cluster
melting is the election of the low-temperature isomer to
be heated. A good knowledge of the ground state struc-
ture (global minimum) is required, as the details of the
melting transition are known to be isomer-dependent.30
But the problem of performing a realistic global opti-
mization search is exponentially diﬃcult as size increases,
so ﬁnding the global minima of clusters with 55 atoms
In our previous work8
or more becomes impractical.
we directly started from icosahedral isomers for Na55,
Na92 and Na142, as there is some experimental9 and
theoretical31 indications that suggest icosahedral pack-
ing in sodium clusters, and found a good agreement with
the experimental results of Haberland’s group.10 Simu-
lated annealing runs for Na92 and Na142 always led to
disordered structures with an energy higher than that of

the corresponding icosahedral isomer. The melting be-
havior of these disordered structures was analyced sep-
arately and found to be diﬀerent from that of icosahe-
dral clusters.32 As the comparison with experiment was
favourable only for icosahedral isomers and the total en-
ergy of these structures was always lower than that of
disordered structures, we have chosen icosahedral isomers
in the study of the melting behavior of large alkali clus-
ters: K55, Rb55 and Cs55 are complete two-shell icosahe-
drons, K92 and K142 are incomplete three-shell icosahe-
drons constructed by following the icosahedral growing
pattern described by Montejano-Carrizales et al.33 The
low-temperature isomer of K20 was obtained by the dy-
namic simulated annealing technique,14 by heating the
cluster to 400 K and then slowly reducing the tempera-
ture. The resulting structure is essentially the same as
that obtained for Na20 with the same technique.7

The temperature evolutions of the speciﬁc heat Cv and
of the rms bond length ﬂuctuation δ of K20 are shown in
Fig 1. The speciﬁc heat displays two maxima around 90
K and 130 K. The δ(T) curve has a small positive slope at
low temperatures that reﬂects the thermal expansion of
the solidlike cluster, and then two abrupt increases that
correlate with the two peaks in the speciﬁc heat. Both
magnitudes indicate that the melting of K20 occurs in two
well separated steps over a wide range of temperatures.
To analyce the nature of those two steps we show in Fig.
2 short-time averages of the “atomic equivalence indexes”
of K20 for a number of representative temperatures. For
a temperature at which the cluster is completely solid,
the σi(t) curves show a high degeneracy which is speciﬁc
of the symmetry of the isomer under consideration.30 The
structure of K20, as that of Na20,7 can be divided into
two subsets: two internal “core” atoms and 18 periph-
eral “surface” atoms. The transition at ≈ 90 K is iden-
tiﬁed with an isomerization transition in which the 18
peripheral atoms begin to interchange their positions in
the cluster while the two central atoms remain oscillat-
ing around their initial positions. When a temperature
of ≈ 130 K is reached, one of the two inner atoms moves
out to the cluster surface, while the other remains in
its central position. Then the second transition is iden-
tiﬁed with another isomerization transition in which a
new set of (19+1) isomers begins to be visited. The δ
quantity increases with temperature after this point in a
smooth way. This is due to the more and more frequent
interchanges of the central atom with one of the periph-
eral atoms upon increasing the temperature. Neverthe-
less, the interchange rate between central and peripheral
atoms remains slower than the interchange rate between
peripheral atoms for all temperatures considered.

Fig. 3 shows the speciﬁc heat and δ curves for K55.
The speciﬁc heat displays a main assymetric peak cen-
tered approximately at 160 K, while δ shows two abrupt
increases at ≈ 110 K and 160 K. The second abrupt in-
crease in δ coincides with the position of the main spe-
ciﬁc heat peak. Although the ﬁrst step in δ is not in
correspondence with any well-deﬁned speciﬁc heat peak,

there is a visible shoulder in the low temperature side (a
clear assymetry) of that peak. Moreover, the width of
the transition region, approximately 100 K, is predicted
to be the same with both indicators. The nature of melt-
ing is analyced by plotting the temperature evolution of
the time-averaged radial atomic density distribution g(r).
At a low temperature of T=86 K, Fig. 4 shows that the
atoms are distributed in several icosahedral shells (in the
outer shell, the twelve atoms in vertex positions can be
distinguished from the rest due to slightly diﬀerent radial
distances). At the temperature where the ﬁrst step in δ
emerges, the detailed structure in the ionic density distri-
bution has been washed out by the thermal eﬀects, and
the movies show that the cluster surface is melted. How-
ever, the diﬀerent shells are still clearly distinguished,
showing that there are not interchanges between atoms
in diﬀerent shells. At a temperature higher than 160 K,
the disctintion of the several radial shells is not possi-
ble anymore. All the atoms are able to diﬀuse across
the cluster volume, that is both intrashell and intershell
displacements are allowed, and the liquid phase is com-
pletely established. Upon a further increasing in temper-
ature, the only appreciable change in g(r) is due to the
thermal expansion of the cluster.

The results for K92 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Both
the speciﬁc heat and δ predict a two-step melting pro-
cess, with a ﬁrst transition at ≈ 110 K and a second
transition at ≈ 200 K. As seen in Fig. 6, the ﬁrst tran-
sition is associated again with surface melting, with no
substantial intershell diﬀusion. For temperatures higher
than 200 K, the cluster is completely liquid. K142 melts
in two main steps, at ≈ 140 K and 230 K (Fig. 7). There
is also a small bump on the low-temperature side of the
ﬁrst speciﬁc heat peak, correlated with a small abrupt
increase of δ at ≈ 90 K. This previous step is associated
with an isomerization regime in which diﬀerent isomers
preserving the icosahedral symmetry are visited, and was
also found for Na142.8 These isomerizations involve the
motion of the ﬁve vacancies in the outer shell. The sur-
face melting stage is not developed yet, however, as the
icosahedral order persists. The distribution of atoms in
three shells is still distinguished at a temperature of 190
K where the cluster surface is melted. The average radial
ionic density distribution is not completely uniform until
the homogeneous melting temperature is reached.

The bulk melting temperature of K (337 K)34 is re-
duced by a 10 % with respect to that of Na (371 K).34
The melting temperatures of K clusters are also smaller
than those of Na clusters7,8 for all the sizes studied. The
percentage reduction in melting temperature is substan-
tially larger than in the bulk and a slightly decreasing
function of cluster size (19 %, 17 %, 16 % and 15 % for
N=20, 55, 92, and 142, respectively). The nature of the
several premelting eﬀects observed are similar for both
materials. Nevertheless, they are more easily established
in the case of K clusters. For example, surface and ho-
mogeneous melting temperatures were closer together in
the case of Na142 (240 K and 270 K, respectively)8 than

3

they are for K142 (140 K and 230 K, respectively); while
two-step melting was not observed for a perfect two-shell
Na55 icosahedron,8 the melting surface stage is well es-
tablished for K55, which has the same low-temperature
structure; in general, the transition region is wider for K
than for Na clusters.

As the main points in this comparison are quite inde-
pendent of cluster size, we analyce in the following the
melting behavior of Rb and Cs clusters for a ﬁxed clus-
ter size, namely N=55. Speciﬁc heat and δ curves as a
function of temperature are given in Figs. 9 and 10. The
results are similar to those obtained for K55, namely a
main assymetric speciﬁc heat peak and two steps in δ, the
last of which correlates with the peak in the speciﬁc heat.
The radial ionic density distributions of both materials
present a similar temperature dependence and only the
results for Cs55 are shown in Fig. 11. The ﬁrst transition
(at ≈ 110 K for Rb55 and ≈ 90 K for Cs55) is identiﬁed
with surface melting: Fig. 11 at 110 K shows that inter-
shell diﬀusion is not important yet. The second (at ≈ 140
K for Rb55 and 130 K for Cs55 ) corresponds to homoge-
neous melting. We ﬁnd that the diﬀerent alkali clusters
with N=55 atoms melt in a similar way. The main dif-
ferences are the following: a) The homogeneous melting
temperature decreases with increasing atomic number as
in the bulk case, but in a more pronounced way. Specif-
ically, in the series Na→K→Rb→Cs, the bulk melting
temperatures decrease by percentage values of 10 %, 7
%, and 3 %, respectively,34 while for the 55-atom clus-
ters the corresponding percentage values are 17 %, 12.5
%, and 7 %, respectively; b) The height of the speciﬁc
heat peaks decreases and their width increases with in-
creasing atomic number; c) Premelting eﬀects are more
important for the heavier elements. Speciﬁcally, two-step
melting was not observed in the case of Na55,8 while a
well deﬁned surface melting stage is observed in the ther-
mal evolution of K55, Rb55 and Cs55.

It is perhaps not surprising that the melting tempera-
ture reduction is larger in clusters compared to the bulk
phase, where coordination eﬀects associated with a large
proportion of atoms in surface-like positions do not ap-
pear. But a meaningful comparison can not be done due
to the diﬀerent structures adopted by alkali elements in
the cluster (icosahedral packing) and bulk (bcc packing)
phases. The other two points do not invoke any com-
parison with the bulk phase, and can be more conve-
niently addressed. Rey at al.35 have analyced the in-
ﬂuence of the softness of the repulsive core interaction
on cluster melting. Speciﬁcally, a series of pair poten-
tials diﬀering just in their shape in the core region was
constructed and used to investigate the melting behav-
ior of 13-particle clusters. For those potentials with soft
core repulsion, two-step melting was observed: the ﬁrst
step corresponds to the onset of frequent isomerizations
involving only the surface atoms, while the second corre-
sponds to homogeneous melting, involving also the cen-
tral atom. For the harder potentials, those two steps
merge into one, and melting-in-steps processes do not ap-

pear. The repulsive part of our pseudopotential is harder
the lighter is the alkali element,26 so the importance of
premelting eﬀects can be expected to increase in the se-
ries Na→K→Rb→Cs.
In eﬀect, a well-deﬁned surface
melting stage is not observed for Na55, while it develops
before the homogeneous melting point for the heavier al-
kali elements. Moseler and Nordiek36 have studied the
inﬂuence of the potential range on the heat capacity of
13-atom Morse clusters. They have found that decreasing
the range of the potential increases the peak of the heat
capacity in the melting transition region. The range of
our pseudopotential increases with atomic number for the
alkali elements,26 so a decrease in the height of the spe-
ciﬁc heat peak is expected in the series Na→K→Rb→Cs.
This is what is observed indeed. Thus, we conclude that
melting proceeds in a qualitatively similar way in clus-
ters of the alkali elements Na, K, Rb and Cs, and that
the small existing diﬀerences can be explained in terms of
the diﬀerent parameters deﬁning the corresponding local
pseudopotentials.

A few comments regarding the quality of the simu-
lations and of the annealing runs are perhaps in order
here. The orbital-free representation of the atomic in-
teractions is much more eﬃcient than the more accurate
KS treatments, but is still substantially more expensive
computationally than a simulation using phenomenolog-
ical many-body potentials. Such potentials contain a
number of parameters that are usually chosen by ﬁtting
some bulk and/or molecular properties. In contrast our
model is free of external parameters, although there are
approximations in the kinetic and exchange-correlation
functionals. The orbital-free scheme accounts, albeit ap-
proximately, for the eﬀects of the detailed electronic dis-
tribution on the total energy and the forces on the ions.
We feel that this is particularly important in metallic
clusters for which a large proportion of atoms are on the
surface and experience a very diﬀerent electronic envi-
ronment than an atom in the interior. Furthermore, the
adjustment of the electronic structure and consequently
the energy and forces to rearrangements of the ions is also
taken into account. But the price to be paid for the more
accurate description of the interactions is a less complete
statistical sampling of the phase space. The simulation
times are substantially shorter than those that can be
achieved in phenomenological simulations. Nevertheless,
we expect that the locations of the several transitions are
reliable, because all the indicators we have used, both
thermal and structural ones, are in essential agreement
on the temperature at which the transitions start.

IV. SUMMARY

The melting-like transition in KN , with N=20, 55, 92
and 142, Rb55 and Cs55 clusters has been investigated
by applying an orbital-free, density-functional molecu-
lar dynamics method. The computational eﬀort which

4

is required is modest in comparison with the traditional
Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics technique based on
Kohn-Sham orbitals, that would be very costly for clus-
ters of these sizes. The details of the several transitions
have been explained and found to be similar to those
found in the melting-like transition of sodium clusters:7,8
alkali clusters show generally a separate surface melting
stage prior to homogeneous melting. The homogeneous
melting temperature has been found to decrease with in-
creasing atomic number as in the bulk limit, but the per-
centage value of this temperature reduction is larger than
for the bulk materials, due to the larger proportion of
surface-like atoms existing in the cluster; in fact, the re-
duction in melting temperature when passing from Na to
K clusters slightly decreases with increasing cluster size.
The height of the speciﬁc heat peaks decreases and their
width increases with increasing atomic number, and the
premelting eﬀects are more important for the heavier al-
kalis. These trends have been rationalized in terms of
physical features of the local pseudopotentials employed.

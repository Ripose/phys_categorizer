n = 6 are observed. The observed fragment spectrum is, within statistical error, independent of the
temperature T of the parent cluster for T ≤ 1500 K. These ﬁndings are consistent with and explain
recent trends observed experimentally.

Starting with the work of Sattler et al. [1] on van der
Waal’s clusters, the study of the fragmentation (ﬁssion)
of charged atomic or molecular clusters has proved a valu-
able experimental tool for investigating the intrinsic sta-
bility and binding forces of these objects. These stud-
ies and others yield important insights into the behavior
of matter at the small size limit and the size-dependent
evolution toward bulk properties. Much recent work on
ﬁssion has been devoted to metallic clusters, both ex-
perimentally [2–11] and theoretically [4,9,12–16]. Fission
of metallic clusters is particularly interesting on account
of the similarities and diﬀerences with the nuclear ﬁssion
process [12]. Over a century ago, Lord Rayleigh [17] stud-
ied the problem of the time development of the Coulomb
instability of a surface-charged liquid drop, and conjec-
tured that the excess charge would be removed by the
emission of jets, rather than by ﬁssion into two parts of
more or less equal size (as occurs for nuclei, where the
charge is distributed uniformly through the volume).

According to the Rayleigh criterion [17], a charged liq-
uid drop is unstable against Coulomb forces when its
ﬁssility X > 1, where X = ECoul/(2Esurf ) is propor-
tional to the ratio of the Coulomb to surface energy of
Q+, assumed spheri-
the drop. For a metallic cluster MN
cal with radius rsN 1/3 (rs is the Wigner-Seitz radius for
s σ)−1Q2/N , where σ is
the metal), this gives X = (16πr3
the surface tension, or X ≈ 2.5Q2/N for NaN
Q+. Now,
ﬁssion experiments on metallic clusters where the cluster
is charged by laser ionization [2–7] have so far produced
only clusters with X < 1, for which an energy barrier ex-
ists against ﬁssion. Thermally activated ﬁssion may be
observed, however, and the dominant charged fragment is
+, which has a closed electronic shell and
found to be Na3
is particularly stable; Na+ has not so far been observed.
In a diﬀerent type of experiment [8–11], sodium clusters
are ionized by collision with a beam of highly charged
ions, a technique that is expected to allow study of a
much wider range of X and cluster temperatures. Coinci-
dence measurements reveal multifragmentation processes

in some cases, often with Na+ as the dominant fragment.
In this Letter, we oﬀer the ﬁrst systematic dynamical
study of metallic cluster ﬁssion in the regime X > 1 using
ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) [18]. We ﬁnd that for
+ is
X close to unity, sequential emission of mainly Na3
the dominant decay channel, while for X ≫ 1, multifrag-
mentation with Na+ as the dominant fragment occurs.
Our simulations provide detailed spatial and temporal
information on the ﬁssion process, and explain of some
of the trends observed experimentally.

On each time step of the cluster dynamics, we compute
the density of valence electrons (and hence the forces on
the ions) within the temperature-dependent Kohn-Sham
(KS) formalism [19], using the local density approxima-
tion (at zero temperature) for the exchange-correlation
functional Exc[ρ]. We use a real-space ﬁnite-diﬀerence
method, recently developed by us [20], incorporating a
novel system of adaptive simulation cells that surround,
adapt to, and follow each distinct fragment during a mul-
tifragmentation, permitting the simulation to continue
eﬃciently up to large fragment separations. To achieve
better fragmentation statistics, at the expense of some
loss of ﬁrst-principles accuracy, we employ a soft, phe-
nomenological pseudopotential [21], which permits a rel-
atively large real-space grid step ∆ = 1.35 a.u. We do not
expect our choice of functional Exc[ρ] or pseudopotential
to aﬀect signiﬁcantly the main results for barrierless ﬁs-
sion.

To study the fragmentation of a single species NaN
at an “initial temperature” Tin, we run M dynamical sim-
ulations arising from an ensemble of M initial conditions
constructed as follows: (i) We optimize the geometry of
the neutral cluster NaN at 0 K; (ii) we perform an MD
run of ≥ 20 ps for NaN at 400 K (which is roughly the
temperature of the clusters NaN output by the cluster
source in the collision experiments [8–11]); (iii) we take
M ionic (nuclear) conﬁgurations {R(n)

{V(n)

tion; (iv) for each {R(n)

with conﬁguration {R(n)

chosen to give an ionic (kinetic) temperature Tion = Tin.
While the fragmentation spectra may depend to some ex-
tent on the initialization procedure, the above procedure
has been chosen to approximate the heavy-ion collision
experiments [8–11]. The collision time is fast, of order
10 fs, so the ionic coordinates {RI} are eﬀectively frozen
during the ionization process, as above. The scaling fac-
tor λ in the initial conditions is intended to approximate
the extra energy “injected” into the ionic system by re-
laxation of the valence electrons, which are excited during
the collision. Steps (iv) and (v) above eﬀectively assume
this relaxation to be very rapid. We discuss the relative
sizes of relaxation and fragmentation times below.

Although we are mainly concerned with barrierless ﬁs-
sion X > 1, to assess the accuracy of our KS approach,
and to make contact with previous experiment and the-
ory, we ﬁrst consider brieﬂy the binary ﬁssion of small
doubly-charged clusters. Our lowest-energy geometries
for NaN (4 ≤ N ≤ 8) agree with previous density-
functional theory (DFT) studies [22,13], and our pseu-
dopotential is adjusted to give a good ﬁt to ionization
and atomization energies for this size range, to within
the scatter of previous DFT results [22,13]. We ﬁnd

phenomenological pseudopotential.

Let us now turn to a systematic study of the eﬀect
of ﬁssility on the fragmentation spectrum for ﬁssilities
greater than one. We shall consider the fragmentation of
Q+ for Q = 4–8 (X = 1.7–6.7) with initial tempera-
Na24
Q+
tures Tin = 400 K, 800 K, and 1500 K. We ﬁnd Na24
to be unstable (at 0 K) in our KS model for Q ≥ 4;
3+ (X = 0.94) is just stable, with a barrier of about
Na24
+. For each Q and Tin, we run
0.2 eV for removal of Na3
M = 10 simulations, each lasting up to 5 ps (Q = 4),
3 ps (Q = 5–6), or 2 ps (Q = 7–8). A distinct ﬁnal-
q+ is considered to have formed when
state fragment Nan
all n ions in it are separated from the remaining ions by
more than a cutoﬀ distance rcut = 14.0 a.u. Its charge
q is calculated as the total charge inside a box centered
on the fragment with a border of at least 7.0 a.u. from
any ion. Usually, q is integral to better than a few per-
cent, and the identiﬁcation of the fragment is unambigu-
ous. But this is not guaranteed by the KS formalism:
when two virtual orbitals centered on diﬀerent clusters
are nearly degenerate and overlap, the resulting KS or-
bital may “split” between the two centers yielding frac-
tional charges. This turns out to be particularly likely
to happen with monomers or dimers emitted toward the
end of a multifragmentation process.

In such cases, it is usually possible to assign integral
charges unambiguously by interpreting the electron wave-
functions statistically. A typical example would be

Na24

8+ → 4Na+ + Na18

2.85+ + Na0.53+ + Na0.70+. (1)

The ﬁrst four fragments emitted here are Na+ with
very close to integer charge, but when the simulation is
stopped (here after 2 ps), the remaining fragments are
fractionally charged. We round the large fragment up to
3+, and assume that the total remaining charge of
Na18
1.08 shared by the two monomers is to be interpreted, in
a statistical sense, as Na + Na+, with the probability for
ﬁnding the charge +1 on a particular monomer given by
the fractional charges. In this way, we often ﬁnd neutral
monomers or dimers emitted in the ﬁnal stages of a mul-
tifragmentation (but never among the initial fragments),
which we interpret as evaporation from a hot residual
fragment. Note that the slight excess of positive charge
Pi qi = 8.08 on the r.h.s. of Eq. (1) is due to spillout
of electron density from the boxes used to calculate the
total charge, which results in a slight underestimate of
the negative electronic charge. When simple rounding or
charge redistribution among equivalent species does not

the simulation, which was the case for less than 5% of
simulations.

Some typical snapshots of Coulomb ﬁssion processes
illustrating the main points are shown in Fig. 2. For
Q = 4 (X = 1.7) (and also for Q = 3, X = 0.94), we
+ on a 1 ps time
ﬁnd mainly sequential emission of Na3
scale, with only rarely Na+ emission. Such emission con-
tinues until the large residual fragment (which ultimately
develops a ﬁssion barrier) is too cool to emit further frag-
ments, at least on the time scale of our simulation, here
5 ps. (It is possible that with a longer simulation time
we would occasionally observe emission of an additional
singly-charged fragment.) As Q increases, we ﬁnd emis-
sion of increasing quantities of Na+, which is the domi-
nant fragment for Q ≥ 5. All singly charged fragments
up to size six are observed in some quantities.

Figure 3 shows in detail a disintegration of Na24

(X = 5.1) as a function of time.
In Fig. 3(a), taken
at t = 0.10 ps, two Na+ at the top and bottom left are
about to leave the cluster. After 0.2 ps [Fig. 3(b)], a
+ start to leave from the rear. At
third Na+ and a Na3
t = 0.3 ps [Fig. 3(c)], the residual cluster is already highly
deformed, and eventually emits a further Na+ and Na3
+
+ residue that remains
after about 0.7 ps, leaving a Na14
stable up to 2 ps, when the simulation was terminated.
The ﬁrst few Na+ ions emitted at about t ∼ 0.1 ps were
initially at the surface, where the valence electron den-
sity is low (the excess positive charge tends to be located
near the surface in a metallic cluster). We conclude that
these ions were suﬃciently weakly bound that they they
simply accelerated outwards starting at t = 0.

The precise fragmentation pattern found in a given
run for large X is very sensitive to the initial condition,
even for a given Tin. However, averaging over initial con-
ditions, we ﬁnd the mean number of a given fragment

emitted to be, within statistical error, essentially inde-
pendent of Tin for Tin = 400 K, 800 K, and 1500 K.
This is perhaps not surprising, since the Coulomb en-
Q+ is ECoul ≈ 1.2Q2 eV, while the ionic ki-
ergy of Na24
netic energy is only Ekin ≈ 0.3 eV per 100 K and is thus
small compared to ECoul for all cases considered here.

The average time elapsed before the emission of the

combined electronic-ionic dynamical study within time-
dependent KS [16] suggests that electron-ion relaxation
times τr may be of order τr ≤ 100 fs, and thus competi-
tive with the time scale τf of some faster fragmentation
processes (τf ≥ 50 fs). However, as we have seen, these
faster processes involve immediate acceleration of Na+
away from the surface region of the cluster, a process
which does not require electron-ion relaxation to occur.
Moreover, our mean fragment spectra are found to be es-
sentially independent of Tin up to at least Tin = 1500 K.
We do not believe, therefore, that our approximate treat-
ment of electron-ion relaxation via the parameters λ and
Tin will lead to a signiﬁcant qualitative error in our re-
sults.

The trend shown in Fig. 4 is consistent with the obser-
vation in a heavy-ion collision experiment [10] that Na+
dominates the inclusive small fragment spectrum when
Xe20+ is the projectile, while Na3
+ dominates when Ar3+
is the projectile, since the heavier ion Xe20+ should pro-
Q+ with higher charge Q. Our results
duce clusters NaN
are consistent also with another collision experiment [11],
+ is found to dominate in events with a sin-
in which Na3
gle light fragment, while Na+ dominates in events with a
multiplicity p of light fragments p ≥ 2. We conclude that
in the latter events one is observing multifragmentation
of parent clusters with X > 1.

We note that the preference for Na+ emission for
X ≫ 1 is qualitatively consistent with simple considera-
tions of the total energy released (Q-value) in a charged
liquid-drop model [12], which favors the distribution of
the parent charge over many small fragments. Also, in
a statistical model [14] that assumes an ergodic distribu-
tion of ﬁssion fragments for a system conﬁned to a small
volume, evidence was found for a ﬁrst-order “fragmenta-
tion phase transition” from a regime with a large residual
fragment at low excitation energies to a regime with only
small fragments at high excitation energies. We do not
observe clear evidence for such an eﬀect in the present
data, although our statistics and range of study are too
limited. However, we note that, in addition to providing
detailed spatial and temporal information, the present
dynamical approach avoids the ergodic assumption in the
statistical model.

Our test system Na24

Q+ is perhaps too small to be
able to observe jets unambiguously. We observe only
small fragments, which tend to be emitted isotropically,
although the cluster has a tendency to elongate during
the process (see Figs. 2 and 3). We stress that these con-
clusions pertain to the regime of barrierless ﬁssion X > 1.
We have also searched for symmetric ﬁssion when X < 1,
where experimental evidence exists for the emission of

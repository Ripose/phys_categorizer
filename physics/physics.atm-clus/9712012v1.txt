Electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom in atom–cluster collisions are treated simultaneously
and self–consistently by combining time–dependent density functional theory with classical molecu-
lar dynamics. The gradual change of the excitation mechanisms (electronic and vibrational) as well
as the related relaxation phenomena (phase transitions and fragmentation) are studied in a common
framework as a function of the impact energy (eV. . . MeV). Cluster “transparency” characterized
by practically undisturbed atom–cluster penetration is predicted to be an important reaction mech-
anism within a particular window of impact energies.

Collisions with atomic clusters represent a relatively
new branch of collision physics as compared to the well
established ﬁelds of ion–atom collisions [1] and ion–solid
interaction [2]. The study of cluster collisions is of par-
ticular interest and importance because it oﬀers the pos-
sibility to tackle bridge–building questions (like the con-
tinuous transition from individual excitations in the ele-
mentary ion–atom collision to the macroscopic stopping
power in solids) as well as fundamental problems (like
phase transitions in ﬁnite systems).
It is also an ex-
tremely challenging and complicated ﬁeld as the com-
prehensive understanding of these collisions still requires
the development of basically new techniques for both,
large–scale (multi–parametric) experiment and many–
body (quantum–mechanical) theory. In this request, the
present situation resembles very much that of nuclear
physics at the beginning of the 80’s [3].

Experimentally, large progress has been made, mean-
while, in the investigation of adiabatic cluster collisions
where the reaction mechanism is determined by vibra-
tional excitations only. Typical examples are the study
of the vibrational energy transfer [4], the fusion between
clusters [5], the formation of endohedral complexes [6],
and the collision induced dissociation (CID) [7]. There is
also a lasting interest to study non–adiabatic cluster col-
lisions where electronic transitions occur. Experiments in
this ﬁeld concern the measurements of the charge trans-
fer [8–10], ionization and electronic excitation [11], as well
as the selective observation of vibrational and electronic
excitations [12].

Theoretically, adiabatic cluster collisions can be well
described by quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) or
molecular dynamics (MD) [13–17]. Also, isomeric [18]
and solid–liquid phase transitions [19,20] in clusters as
well as the ﬁssion process of clusters [21] have been stud-
ied with MD or QMD where, basically, electronic excita-
tions are not considered. On the other hand, electronic
transitions in non–adiabatic cluster collisions have been

treated with classical [22,23], semi–classical [24], or one–
electron quantum mechanical [25,26] approaches where
the atomic structure, and thus the vibrational degrees of
freedom, are not taken into account. Recently, a gen-
eral theory has been developed [27] which is able to de-
scribe simultaneously adiabatic and non–adiabatic colli-
sions and, in particular, also the still completely unknown
transition regime where both — electronic and vibra-
tional — excitations occur. This so–called non–adiabatic
quantum molecular dynamics (NA–QMD) [27] can also
be used to study, for the ﬁrst time, phase transitions
in and fragmentation of clusters induced by electron–
vibration coupling.

In this work, diﬀerent excitation mechanisms (elec-
tronic and vibrational) as well as related relaxation
phenomena (phase transitions and fragmentation) in
cluster collisions are studied in the microscopic frame-
work of NA–QMD. This theory treats electronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom simultaneously and self–
consistently in atomic many–body systems by combining
time–dependent density functional theory [28] with clas-
sical MD. The key point, in order to derive practicable
equations of motion, is the split of the total electronic
density into the adiabatic and a remaining part, treating
afterwards the exchange–correlation terms with the adia-
batic density only [27]. This approximation has been ap-
plied and successfully tested against experimental data,
so far, for the interpretation of fragment correlations in
CID [29] and the calculation of absolute cross sections for
charge transfer [30] in cluster reactions. Here the univer-
sal NA–QMD approach is used to investigate the gradual
change of the excitation and relaxation mechanisms as a
function of the impact energy in a wide range for two,
+ + Na (with at-
basically diﬀerent collision systems, Na9
tractive adiabatic forces between projectile and target)
+ + He (with dominating repulsive forces and a

In the left column, the corre-
sponding adiabatic QMD calculations (dotted lines) are also
shown for comparison. Note the diﬀerent time scales for the
excitation processes (femtoseconds) and the relaxation phe-
nomena (picoseconds).

Excitation and relaxation mechanisms and, in partic-
ular, the related time scales are basically diﬀerent in all
cases. In the pure adiabatic regime (Ecm=200 eV), the
vibrational excitation of the cluster (∆E≈1.4 eV) is im-
mediately connected with a fragmentation process which,

(b=0)

in contrast to statistical evaporation, starts to proceed
already during the interaction time of ∼ 40 fs (see left
part of Fig. 2) as a consequence of suﬃcient momentum
transfer between projectile and target atoms. Such non–
statistical fragmentation has been experimentally veri-
ﬁed only very recently [12] (called “impulsive” fragmenta-
tion mechanism). On the contrary, in the high–energetic
non–adiabatic region Ecm=200 keV electronic excitation
(∼ 1 fs) and fragmentation (∼ 300 fs) processes are sep-
arated by two orders of magnitude. Obviously, electron–
vibration coupling needs time to become eﬀective and
to induce dissociation (“electronic” fragmentation). At
an impact energy of Ecm=2 keV the cluster remains sta-
ble after the collision with a total excitation energy of
∆E≈0.7 eV originally stored predominantly in electronic
excitation (cf. adiabatic and non–adiabatic contributions
to ∆E in the left part of Fig. 2). Electron–vibration
coupling leads, however, to the excitation of collective
surface vibrations indicated by the regular oscillating
behaviour of d(t) well developed after about 1 ps. At
Ecm=20 keV the ﬁrst step of the relaxation phase is very
similar to that observed at Ecm=2 keV. But, in this case
electron–vibration coupling induces clearly a phase tran-
sition from “solid” to “liquid” in a second relaxation step
coming about 10 ps after the collision. Owing to the large
TKEL (∆E≈2.7 eV) one should expect statistical evap-
oration as the ﬁnal decay channel.

The excitation and relaxation mechanisms, summa-
rized in Figs. 1 and 2, appear in a well deﬁned order
as a function of the impact energy due to the deliber-
ately ﬁxed collision geometry. For a given impact energy
and, in particular, for comparison with experiment the
impact parameter dependence of measurable quantities
averaged over diﬀerent orientations of the cluster with
respect to the beam axis is of interest.

impact energy Ecm calculated with NA–QMD using randomly

for a binary collision of the He atom with one cluster atom
(dotted) [31,33]. Lower part: Total fragmentation cross sec-
tions as a function of Ecm calculated with NA–QMD (solid

For the TKEL this dependence is shown in Fig. 3 for an
impact energy in the non–adiabatic regime. The results
are compared to the well–known Lindhard model [32] of
the electronic stopping power in solids. This phenomeno-
logical model describes surprisingly well the mean value
of ∆E for impact parameters smaller than the cluster
radius, b <∼ 8 a.u. There are, however, two character-
istic and measurable peculiarities of ∆E(b) in the mi-
croscopic calculations. First, for small impact parame-
ters b <∼ 6 a.u., there are a few events with a very large
TKEL. They result from binary atom collisions between
the Na–target and a cluster atom, leading to very fast
fragment monomers. In a macroscopic language, these
direct “knock–out” collisions correspond to the nuclear
stopping power [2]. Second, for impact parameters larger
than the cluster radius, b >∼ 8 a.u., the calculated (in that
case purely electronic) TKEL are not small as compared
to the dissociation energy of the cluster. Consequently,
“electronic” fragmentation (cf. Fig. 2) may essentially
contribute to the total fragmentation cross section which
can be expected to be several times larger than the geo-
metrical one.

The most interesting and unexpected phenomenon of

the studies performed so far is the occurrence of clus-
+ + He.
ter “transparency” in the closed shell system Na9
This mechanism is characterized by a practically undis-
turbed atom–cluster penetration in a certain, small range
of Ecm within the transition regime. In Fig. 4, the TKEL
as a function of Ecm calculated for random orientations
with impact parameter b=0 is shown. It can be clearly
seen that in the window between Ecm ∼ 10 eV and ∼
100 eV the variance of ∆E becomes markedly large and
there are a lot of events with an extremely small energy
loss. Obviously, for speciﬁc collision geometries in this
range of Ecm the relative velocity between projectile and
target becomes too large to excite vibrational degrees of
freedom and is, on the other hand, still too small to in-
duce electronic transitions. As a consequence, the cluster
appears to be transparent even in central collisions.

One possibility to study the change in the excitation
mechanisms and in particular the occurrence of trans-
parency is to consider the total fragmentation cross sec-
tion as a function of Ecm (lower part of Fig. 4). The the-
oretical cross section σfrag has been calculated by taking
into account an initial temperature of the clusters accord-
ing to recent experiments [33]. An excellent agreement
between theory and experiment is found in the adiabatic
regime where experimental data are available at present,
<∼ 4 eV. It is just the transparency eﬀect which
i. e. Ecm
leads to a pronounced plateau in σfrag between 10 eV and
100 eV before electronic excitations induce a further in-
crease of σfrag(Ecm).

In summary, we have shown how diﬀerent excitation
mechanisms compete and various relaxation phenomena
occur in atom–cluster collisions. First relations and basic
diﬀerences to macroscopic systems have been discussed.

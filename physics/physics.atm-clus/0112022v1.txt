Using the stabilized jellium model with self-compression, we have calculated the dissociation
energies and the barrier heights for the binary fragmentation of charged silver clusters. At each step
of calculations, we have used the relaxed-state sizes and energies of the clusters. The results for the
doubly charged Ag clusters predict a critical size, at which evaporation dominates the ﬁssion, in good
agreement with the experiment. Comparing the dissociation energies and the ﬁssion barrier heights
with the experimental ones, we conclude that in the experiments the fragmentation occurs before the
full structural relaxation expected after the ionization of the cluster. In the decays of Ag4+
N clusters,
the results predict that the charge-symmetric ﬁssion processes are dominant for smaller clusters,
and the charge-asymmetric ﬁssion processes become dominant for suﬃciently larger clusters.

I. INTRODUCTION

The fragmentation of ionic metal clusters1,2 as well as other properties of metallic clusters have been extensively
studied using the jellium model (JM).3–5 In this model, the discrete ions are replaced by a uniform positive charge
background of density n = 3/4πr3
s in which rs is the bulk value of the Wigner-Seitz (WS) radius of the valence
electrons of the metal. The simplest geometry for the positive background is spherical which is appropriate for closed-
shell clusters or large enough clusters in which the Jahn-Teller6 deformation has negligible contribution. However,
using this simple spherical JM, a lot of information on the properties of metal clusters has been obtained. A reﬁned
version of the JM, the stabilized7,8 jellium model (SJM), which was introduced by Perdew et. al.
in 1990, has
improved some drawbacks9,10 of the JM (For a recent review on SJM, see Ref.[13]). In recent years, the SJM has been
used to predict the properties of bulk metals7,11, metal surfaces12–14, metal clusters15–17 and metallic voids.18 The
fragmentation of charged metal clusters has been also studied19,20 by Vieira et. al. using the SJM. However, since
the surface eﬀects have a large contribution in the energetics and sizes of small clusters, and also since in a ﬁssion
process the competition between the surface tension and coulomb repulsion leads to the existence of a barrier, a more
sophesticated use15,17 of the SJM is needed to predict the correct energetics of the clusters and the barrier heights
(BH) in the study of the fragmentation processes. This method, which is called SJM with self-compression (SJM-SC),
has been used to predict the equilibrium sizes and energies of charged21 or spin-polarized17 metal clusters as well as
the calculation of chemical potentials of metallic clusters.22 The SJM-SC has been also used by Sarria et. al.14 to
calculate the surface energies and the work functions of metals. In contrast to the JM and the SJM in which the rs
value is borrowed from the bulk system, in the SJM-SC, the density parameter rs of the jellium sphere is assumed to
be a free parameter which can be adjusted in such a way that a cluster with a given number of electrons and speciﬁc
electronic conﬁguration achieves its equilibrium state. The SJM-SC calculations on neutral metal clusters15,17 has
shown that the equilibrium rs value of the jellium sphere is less than the bulk value and tends to its bulk value for
inﬁnitely large cluster. This phenomenon is called self-compression which is due to the dominant eﬀect of surface
tension in small metal clusters. However, it has been shown that21 charging a small metal cluster can result in an
equilibrium rs value which is larger than the bulk value. This eﬀect is called self-expansion. The self-expansion has
been also predicted for highly polarized metal clusters17,23. These two eﬀects have diﬀerent origins. In the former,
the repulsive coulomb force dominates the surface tension whereas, in the latter, the Pauli force is responsible for the
self-expansion.

In this work, using SJM-SC, we have studied the binary decay processes of positively charged Ag clusters containing
up to 100 atoms in all possible channels. We have considered the following possible decay processes for singly ionized
Ag clusters

Ag1+

N → Ag1+

N −p + Ag0
p,

p = 1, 2, · · · , N − 2.

For doubly charged clusters, the decays can proceed via two diﬀerent processes. The ﬁrst one is the evaporation
process

and the second one is ﬁssion into two charged products

Ag2+

N → Ag2+

N −p + Ag0
p,

p = 1, 2, · · · , N − 3

Ag2+

N → Ag1+

N −p + Ag1+
p ,

p = 2, 3, · · · , [N/2]

In general, for the binary decay of Z-ply charged (Z is a positive integer) cluster, we have

AgZ

N → AgZ−z1

N −p + Agz1
p ,

z1 = 0, 1, · · · , [Z/2]; p = z1 + 1, · · · , N − Z + z1 − 1.

For an even value of Z with z1 = Z/2, the range of p reduces to p = z1 + 1, · · · , [N/2]. The processes for which z1 = 0
( i.e., one of the fragments is neutral), are called evaporation processes and others ( both fragments are charged)
are ﬁssion processes.
In evaporation processes, the negativity of the diﬀerence between total energies before and
after fragmentation is suﬃcient to have a spontaneous decay. However, in ﬁssion processes a negative value for the
diﬀerence energy is not suﬃcient for the ﬁssion of the parent cluster. This is because, the competition between the
short-range surface tension and the long-range repulsive coulomb force may give rise to a ﬁssion barrier ( i.e., one
should supply energy to overcome the barrier).

The organization of this paper is as follows. In section II we explain the method of calculating the total energies and
ﬁssion barriers. To obtain the total energy of a given cluster, we solve the self-consistent Kohn-Sham (KS) equations24
in the density functional theory25 (DFT) with local spin density approximation (LSDA) for the exchange-correlation
(XC) functional. To calculate the ﬁssion barrier, we use the two-touching-spheres model for the saddle conﬁguration.1
In section III, we discuss the results, and ﬁnally, we conclude this work in section IV.

In the context of the SJM, the average energy per valence electron in the bulk with density parameter rs and

polarization ζ is given by26

ε(rs, ζ, rc) = ts(rs, ζ) + εxc(rs, ζ) + ¯wR(rs, rc) + εM(rs),

All equations throughout this paper are expressed in Rydberg atomic units. Here ts and εxc are the mean noninter-
acting kinetic energy and the exchange-correlation energy per particle, respectively. For εc we use the Perdew-Wang
parametrization.27 For a z-valent metal the average Madelung energy, εM, is deﬁned as εM = −9z/5r0, in which r0 is
the radius of the WS sphere, r0 = z1/3rs. In Eq.(5), ζ = (n↑ − n↓)/(n↑ + n↓) in which n↑ and n↓ are the spin densities
of the homogeneous system with total density n = n↑ + n↓. The quantity ¯wR is the average value (over the WS cell)

Here, n = n↑ + n↓ and n+ is the jellium density. Θ(r) takes the value of unity inside the jellium background and
zero, outside. The ﬁrst and second terms in the right hand side of Eq.(13) are the non-interacting kinetic energy and
the exchange-correlation energy, and the last term is the Coulomb interaction energy of the system. The quantity
hδviWS is the average of the diﬀerence potential over the Wigner-Seitz cell and the diﬀerence potential, δv, is deﬁned
as the diﬀerence between the pseudopotential of a lattice of ions and the electrostatic potential of the jellium positive
background. The eﬀective potential, used in the self-consistent KS equations, is obtained by taking the variational

In our spherical JM, we have

B. Dissociation energy and ﬁssion barrier

The dissociation energy (DE) for the general binary decay process (4), deﬁned as the diﬀerence in the sum of total

energies of the products and the total energy of the parent cluster, is given by

DZ

z1(N, p) = (EZ−z1

N −p + Ez1

p ) − EZ
N ,

(22)

4

In evaporation processes (z1 = 0), a negative value for the DE implies that the parent cluster is unstable against
that particular decay channel and therefore, the fragmentation is spontaneous. On the other hand, a positive DE in
a particular decay channel means that the parent cluster is stable against the decay in that particular channel. That
is, one should somehow supply energy to the system to induce the fragmentation. For processes (1) and (2) the DE
becomes

N ,

respectively. However, in the ﬁssion processes (z1 > 0) as in Eq.(3), a negative DE does not mean that the cluster
would decay. It is because of the existence of a ﬁssion barrier which originates from the short-range attractive (due
to binding energy) and long-range repulsive (due to coulomb repulsion) forces between the charged products. The
situation is shown in Fig. 1. Any excitation above the barrier, which may be induced by collisions or radiation, will
eventually make the expected decay possible. One of the main deﬁciencies of the JM is that it gives negative values9
of surface energies for rs ≤ 2. Our using of SJM-SC is expected, therefore, to give more realistic values of surface
energies and barrier heights. The ﬁssion barrier BZ
z1(N, p) is approximated by the Coulomb interaction Ec of two
touching spheres (i.e., the ﬁssion products) and the DE as

BZ

z1(N, p) = DZ

z1(N, p) + Ec

For the Coulomb interaction between the two ﬁssion products we take into account their polarizabilities. The
interaction energy of two charged conducting spheres can be calculated numerically using image charge method.1 An
equally good but much simpler approach is the use of the analytical expression29,30 for the interaction between charges

where, for silver, the value δR = 0.94 takes the polarizability into account. The BH’s for small clusters, obtained
from this formula, are somewhat smaller than those we obtained using Eqs. (26), (27). Koizumi et. al.33,34 have
calculated the barrier heights for the ﬁssion of doubly charged silver clusters using a shape function in the LDM with
shell correction.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

After an extensive self-consistent SJM-SC calculations, we have calculated the equilibrium rs values and the energies
of AgZ
N (Z=0,1,2,3,4) for diﬀerent cluster sizes (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). To show the main diﬀerences in the equilibrium rs
values of these clusters, which are appreciable for relatively small clusters, we have plotted, in Fig. 2, the corresponding
¯rs(N ) values only up to N = 34. As is obviously seen in the ﬁgure, the neutral and singly ionized clusters are self-
compressed for all values of N . This is because of the dominant eﬀect of the surface tension. However, for multiply
charged clusters, the ¯rs(N ) values cross the bulk border (i.e., rs = 3.02) at some N which we show it by N0. Our
results show that, in general, for larger values of charging, the self-expansion persists up to larger values of N0. That
is, N 2+
0 , N 4+
0 ,
respectively. This means that, for larger charging values, the coulomb repulsion between excess charges dominates

the surface tension up to larger values of N0. It is also clearly seen in Fig. 2 that for clusters with the same numbers
of electrons but diﬀerent numbers of atoms, N , the following inequality holds

s (N + 1) < ¯r2+

Figure 3 shows the equilibrium energies per atom in electron-volts for Ag0

N with
diﬀerent cluster sizes (1 ≤ N ≤ 34). For comparison, we have also plotted the bulk value (ε = −7.89eV ) by a dashed
line. As is seen, by increasing the charge of a given N -atom cluster, the coulomb repulsion between the excess charge
induces an inﬂation in the cluster (see Fig. 2) and therefore, the density of the material in the cluster decreases which,
in turn, leads to a smaller binding energies.

In Fig. 4(a) we have plotted the DE’s of the most favored decay channels for the process Ag1+

p.
By deﬁnition, the DE is minimum in the most favored channel. We have shown the most favored value of p by p∗.
The solid small square symbols show the most favored values p∗ on the right vertical axis whereas, the corresponding
DE’s, D1+
0 (N, p∗), are shown on the left vertical axis by large open squares. The dashed line is the result of a ﬁtting
to the quantal DE’s. As is seen, the magority of the clusters have positive DE’s and therefore, they are stable against
the spontaneous decay. However, the remaining clusters have negative DE’s and accorgingly, they decay into smaller
fragments. Clusters close to the closed-shell ones, decay by emitting a monomer or dimer. On the other hand, clusters
that are far from being a closed-shell, can break into two fragments each of which are close or identical to closed-shell
ones. For example, Ag1+
44 emits an Ag0
8
which is a closed-shell and the remaining is Ag1+
80 emits Ag0
20 and
the situation is similar to the latter one. Except for the closed-shell singly ionized cluster Ag1+
69 , all other closed-shell
singly ionized clusters, Ag1+
N (N =3, 9, 19, 21, 35, 41, 59, 91, 93) are stable against the spontaneous decay. The dashed
ﬁtted line which resembles the result of liquid-drop model (LDM) calculations ( see Fig. 4 of Ref. [19]), predicts that
all singly ionized clusters are stable and the asymptotic value of DE is constant and equal to 0.20eV .
Figure 4(b) compares the experimental35 dissociation energies with the monomer DE’s D1+
0 (N, 2), and the most favored DE’s D1+

0 (N, 1), dimer DE’s
D1+
0 (N, p∗). As is seen, the most favored fragments are somewhere monomers,
somewhere dimers and somewhere none of them. The general trend of the calculated monomer dissociation energies
is similar to the experimental one and has a better agreement with the experiment than the other two DE’s. That
is, from N = 3 to N = 4 the energy decreases; from N = 4 to N = 9 the energy increases in the mean; a decrease on
going from 9 to 10; an increase from 10 to 21; and ﬁnally, a decrease from N = 21 to N = 22 and again increasing
from N = 22. However, our results lack the odd-even staggering because, it originates from the nonspherical shapes
for the jellium. Resorting to non-spherical shapes also decreases the pronounced shell eﬀects.32 The relative smallness
of our calculated DE’s can be explained in terms of the details of the experimental setup. If the experiment starts
using neutral AgN clusters, then the equilibrium rs values would be smaller than the bulk value (see the Z = 0 plot
in Fig. 2), and therefore, the total energies would be more negative (see the Z = 0 plot in Fig. 3). Now, irradiating
the parent neutral cluster with a high power laser beam would lead to the ionization of the neutral cluster. If the
photons also interact with the ionized cluster before the ionized cluster achieves its relaxed state, then the equilibrium
rs value of the ionized cluster would be less than the relaxed value (In our calculations we have used the relaxed
values at all steps.), and therefore, the magnitude of the total energy of the ionized parent cluster would be larger.
This fact would lead to larger values of the DE’s. Comparing the experimental data with our results we conclude that
the photo-dissociation occurs before the relaxation of the parent ionized cluster is completed. The other extreme is
that we consider the ‘sudden’ approximation in which we assume that the relaxation time for the ionized cluster is
inﬁnite and the cluster undergoes the dissociation without changing the volume (i.e., the saturation approximation
which is used in nuclear fragmentations and ordinary jellium calculations for clusters). In reality, neither of these
extreme ‘relaxed’ or ‘sudden’ approximations are at work but something in between.

In Fig. 5(a) we have shown the most favored products Ag0

0 (N, p∗) for the
decay of Ag2+
N via evaporation channel. For this process, as in singly ionized case, the dashed ﬁtted line predicts no
spontaneous decays and shows a higher constant asymptotic DE as 0.40eV . The most favored products are mainly
monomers, dimers and octamers.

are negative. The negativity of a BH means that we need no energy to supply the system to initiate the ﬁssion. The
dashed line which shows the mean behavior of BH intersects the zero line at N mean
≈ 29 (the mean appearance size).

In Fig. 5(c) we have compared the most favored decays of Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). It is clearly seen that in a certain
size range, the ﬁssion and evaporation deﬁnitly start their competition. Our quantal results in Fig. 5(c) show that in
the size range 21 ≤ N ≤ 26 the evaporation dominates the ﬁssion which is in good agreement with the Katakuse et.
al. experimental results36 that reveal ﬁssion for N ≤ 22. However, our result is slightly larger than the Kr¨uckeberg
et. al.30 experimental data which show that the ﬁssion occurs for N ≤ 16. This diﬀerence in the experimental results
depends on the details of the experiment. For N > 26, our results show that ﬁssion dominates again. To estimate
the size range at which evaporation completely dominates the ﬁssion, we simply ﬁnd the intersection point of the
two mean behaviors (dashed lines) in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). A simple calculation gives this mean critical value as

0 (N, p∗) and B2+

In Fig. 5(d) we have compared the most favored values D2+

1+ (N, p∗) with the experimental threshold
energies30. Here, also we have smaller DE’s and BH’s compared to the experiment. One reason for this behavior is
that the equilibrium volume of the parent cluster is not equal to the sum of the equilibrium volumes of the product
clusters (i.e., the ‘relaxed’ approximation) but is larger. The larger value of the equilibrium rs leads to a smaller
magnitude of the initial energy and therefore, by Eq. (25) to a smaller barrier heights. In other words, the energy
needed to deform the parent cluster toward the ﬁssion ( In deformation the surface area increases.) is partly paied as
a result of self-expansion of the parent cluster. Our calculations show that in almost all decay channels, the sum of
volumes of the decay products is smaller than that of the parent cluster which can be explained by the fact that in
smaller clusters the surface eﬀect is higher than that in larger clusters. The calculated results for the most favored
values of DE’s at N = 9 and N = 10 are very close to the experimental values. The most favored products at N = 9
and N = 10 are neutral dimer and monomer, respectively (see Fig. 5(a)).
In Fig. 5(e) we have compared the calculated monomer DE’s D2+
1+(N, 3) with the experiment. Here also the diﬀerence is appreciable.
In Fig. 6(a) we have plotted the p∗ and the D3+

0 (N, p∗) for diﬀerent cluster sizes. The situation is similar to other
previous evaporation processes. Here also the asymptotic behavior of the ﬁtted line predicts no decay and has a
constant value of about 0.50eV .

results in the literature on the decay of AgZ
N with Z ≥ 3. It is seen that at N = 38, evaporation dominates and from
N = 39 to N = 42 evaporation and ﬁssion are equally probable. From N = 43 to N = 58, except for N = 54, ﬁssion
dominates again. From N = 59 to N = 67 the evaporation process overcomes and so on. To obtain the mean critical
value, we ﬁnd the intersection point of the two mean behaviors (dashed lines) in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) which results in
the value N mean

N . In this ﬁgure, one notes the
unstability of two smallest sized Ag4+
8 and the stability of almost all others against the evaporation. The ﬁtted
dashed line predicts no evaporation and has the asymptotic value of 0.75eV . The evaporation products are seen to
be mostly neutral dimers and a few monomers and octamers.

In Fig. 7(b) we have plotted the p∗ and the B4+

1+ (N, p∗) as functions of N . We see that at N = 21 the BH becomes
positive for the ﬁrst time. The dashed line shows the mean behavior of the ﬁssion barries. This ﬁtted line has crossed
the zero axis at N mean
N clusters are stable against the charge-asymmetric
ﬁssion channel for N > 74. The most favored charged products are mostly magic clusters, Ag1+

≈ 74. That is, on the average, the Ag4+

N with N = 3, 9, 21.

The results of charge-symmetric binary ﬁssion of Ag4+

N for most favored decays are shown in Fig. 7(c). The smallest

positive BH occurs at N = 22. The mean behavior (the dashed line) intersects the zero line at N mean

≈ 51.
N . It is seen that these
clusters smaller than N ≈ 50 are highly unstable. As is seen from the ﬁgure, it is diﬃcult to specify the competitions
for the quantal values. However, to give quantitative values, we have compared the ﬁtted lines in Fig. 7(e). It is seen
that for N < 20 the charge-symmetric ﬁssion is the dominant spontaneous decay process but, for 20 < N < 51 the
dominant spontaneous ﬁssion process changes to the charge-asymmetric one. For 51 < N < 73 the only spontaneous
ﬁssion decay process is the charge-asymmetric one. Clusters larger than N mean
≈ 73 are stable against any spontaneous
decay process. In an induced fragmentation experiment of Ag4+
N clusters, the dominant process for 73 < N < 107 is
charge-asymmetric ﬁssion, and for N larger than N mean
= 107 the evaporation process dominates. To summarize, for

a

c

smaller clusters the charge-symmetric ﬁssion is dominant, and larger clusters prefer to decay via a charge-asymmetric
ﬁssion process.

Besides the most favored quantities which are strongly related to the stability of the charged cluster and were
explained in the above lines, it is also interesting to calculate the DE’s and BH’s for a process in which the fragment
N −1 + Ag0 in which one of the products is a neutral monomer.
N → AgZ
products are speciﬁed. Consider the process AgZ
We have calculated the dissociation energies DZ
0 (N, 1) for all values of Z=1, 2, 3, 4 and N ≤ 100. The calculated
values show pronounced shell eﬀects as in previous ﬁgures of the most favored channels. However, the mean behaviors
have asymptotic constant values. For Z = 1, 2, 3, 4, these asymptotic values in electron-volts are 0.95, 1.00, 1.08, 1.15,
respectively. This means that the monomer evaporation from a singly charged cluster needs a smaller energy than
N −2 + Ag0
from a doubly charged and so on. The same analysis for the dimer evaporation in the process AgZ
2
shows also constant asymptotic mean behaviors for the DZ
0 (N, 2). The obtained values in electron-volts are 0.49, 0.59,
0.72, 0.87 for Z=1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. This means that, as in the monomer evaporation, the detachment of a dimer
from singly ionized cluster is easier than from a doubly ionized cluster and so on. However, comparing the dissociation
energies for monomer and dimer evaporation (keeping the charge constant) shows that atomic evaporation needs more
energy than dimer evaporation.

N → AgZ

Now, we consider the ﬁssion processes AgZ

N −2 + Ag1+
in which one of the ﬁssion
products is a singly ionized dimer or a singly ionized trimer. The mean behaviors of the BH’s for these processes are
plotted in Fig. 8. As is seen, the energy needed to detach a singly ionized dimer decreases by increasing the charge
of the parent cluster. This behavior should be contrasted to the behavior in the monomer or dimer evaporations. We
recall that in the monomer or dimer evaporation, the dissociation energy increases by increasing the charge of the
parent cluster.

It is now easy to ﬁnd the mean sizes at which atomic evaporation process dominates the ﬁssion into singly ion-
ized dimer or trimer for each charging value of the parent cluster. In doubly charged silver clusters, the monomer
evaporation dominates the singly charged dimer and trimer detachments at N = 11 and N = 31, respectively. The
corresponding numbers for triply charged clusters are 21 and 66. For parent clusters Ag4+
N , the numbers N = 38 and
N = 120 have been obtained. To summarize, by increasing the charge of the parent cluster the competition occurs at
larger values of N .

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we have studied the fragmentations of multiply charged silver clusters taking into account the structural
relaxations of the neutral and charged parent as well as daughter clusters. To calculate the relaxed-state sizes and
energies of the clusters we have employed the stabilized jellium model with self-compression using a spherical geometry
for the jellium background. Using these relaxed-state radius and energy for the clusters, we have calculated the
dissociation energies and barrier heights for evaporation and ﬁssion processes in all possible channels. For the barrier
heights, we have used the two-touching-spheres model with taking into account the polarizabilities of the two charged
products. Comparison of our most favored results with the experimental data shows that our results lie under the
experimetal results but, the critical size for the competition of the evaporation and the ﬁssion of doubly charged silver
clusters is predicted in good agreement with the experiment. This comparison also reveals that the fragmentation
processes mostly occur before the complete relaxation of the charged parent clusters. That is, in the above-mentioned
experiments the structural relaxation time is larger than the average time elapsed for the fragmentation of the ionized
parent cluster. Having the initial (just after ionization) and the relaxed sizes rZ
s,ini, rZ
s,rela of a Z-ply ionized cluster,
one may choose an rZ
s,ini ≤ rZ
s,rela) for the ionized cluster (just before the fragmentation) such
that the calculated values coincides the experimental ones. Then using a linear interpolation it is possible to calculate
the relative fragmentation time for an ionized cluster. In ordinary jellium model calculations, the assumption

s,frag value (rZ

s,frag ≤ rZ

r0
s (N ) = rZ

s (N ) = rZ

s,ini(N ) = rZ

s,frag(N ) = rZ

s,rela(N ) = rs,bulk

(30)

is used. It should be mentioned that for exact matching of the calculated and experimental values one should use
non-spherical shapes.

We have obtained the asymptotic DE’s for the most favored channels in evaporation processes by ﬁtting a simple
curve on the quantal results. The result shows that the asymptotic values increase by increasing the charge of the
parent cluster. In the case of Ag4+
N , we have shown that for relatively small clusters the charge-symmetric ﬁssion
process is dominant and then, before dominating the evaporation process the charge-asymmetric ﬁssion process
overcomes. In general, the critical size (at which the evaporation dominates the ﬁssion) increases by increasing the
charge of the parent cluster. The results show that the neutral p-mer dissociation energy increases by increasing
the charge of the parent cluster; and for a given charged parent, the atomic evaporation needs more energy than a

8

dimer evaporation. Finally, it has been shown that the energy needed for the detachment of a singly charged dimer
or singly charged trimer decreases by increasing the charge of the parent cluster. However, for a given parent cluster,
the detachment of a singly charged trimer is easier than that of a singly charged dimer.

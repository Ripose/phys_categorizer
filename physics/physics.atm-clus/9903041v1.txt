The time-dependent local density approximation is applied to the optical re-

sponse of the silver clusters, Ag2, Ag3, Ag8 and Ag+

9 . The calculation includes

all the electrons beyond the closed-shell Ag+11 ionic core, thus including for

the ﬁrst time explicitly the ﬁlled d-shell in the response. The excitation energy

of the strong surface plasmon near 4 eV agrees well with experiment. The

theoretical transition strength is quenched by a factor of 4 with respect to the

pure s-electron sum rule in Ag8 due to the d-electrons. A comparable amount

of strength lies in complex states below 6 eV excitation. The total below 6

eV, about 50% of the s sum rule, is consistent with published experiments.

I. INTRODUCTION

The optical response of clusters of IB elements has been an interesting theoretical chal-

lenge: while their chemistry is dominated by the atom’s single valence s-electron, the electri-

cal properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the nearby ﬁlled d-shell. Up to now, the d-electrons

have been treated only implicitly by a dielectric approximation [1]. For example, one of the

interesting phenomena that has been attributed to the d-electrons is the blue shift of the

surface plasmon for small clusters [2–4]. The d-electrons also strongly screen the oscillator

strength of the valence electrons, and this raises the question of whether the theory is con-

sistent with the measured oscillator strength, which are only somewhat below the full sum

for the s-electrons [5–7].

In this work, we calculate the optical response explicitly including the d-electrons, using

the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA). We begin by recalling the limit-

ing behavior in some simple extreme models. The ﬁrst is the free-electron model including

only the s-electrons, as in the jellium theory. This produces a collective mode with all of the

oscillator strength at a frequency related to the number density n by ωM =

4πe2n/3m.

At the bulk density of silver, this gives an excitation energy of 5.2 eV. The second limiting

q

case is the Mie theory, treating the cluster as a classical dielectric sphere. The Mie theory

in the long wavelength limit gives the optical absorption cross section as [10]

σ =

4πωR3
c

Im

ǫ(ω) − 1
ǫ(ω) + 2

(1)

where R is the radius of the sphere and ǫ(ω) is the dielectric function. In Fig. 1 we show

the result expressed as the cross section per atom, taking ǫ(ω) from ref. [11]. The graph also

shows the integrated oscillator strength per atom, fE/N =

Ei<E fi/N. We see that there

is a sharp peak at 3.5-3.6 eV, but that the oscillator strength is only 1/6 of the sum rule for

P

s-electrons. Thus the eﬀect of the screening is to push the s-electron surface plasmon down

from 5.2 to 3.5 eV, together with a strong quenching of the oscillator strength.

II. THE TDLDA METHOD

The details of our implementation of the TDLDA are given in ref. [12,13]. The cal-

culation is performed in real time, which has the advantage that the entire response is

calculated at once, and only a Fourier transformation is needed to extract strengths of indi-

vidual excitations. The Hamiltonian we employ is one that has been frequently used in static

calculations. The electron-electron interaction is treated in the local density approximation

following the prescription of ref. [14]. The ionic potential is treated in the pseudopotential

approximation keeping only the d- and s-electrons active. The l-dependent pseudopotentials

were constructed according to the method of Troullier and Martins [15]. We showed in ref.

[16] that for the atom the resulting pseudopotential is adequate to describe the electromag-

netic response well into the continuum, even though the sum rules become ambiguous [16].

We make one further approximation in the Hamiltonian, treating the nonlocality in the

pseudopotential by the method of Kleinman and Bylander [17]. The approximation takes

one angular momentum state as given by the radial pseudopotential and corrects the others

by adding a separable function. A potential problem of this method is that there may be

spurious deeply bound states in some of the partial waves [18]. We take the local wave to

be the s-wave, which avoids the diﬃculty.

The critical numerical parameters in the implementation of the TDLDA on a coordinate-

space mesh is the mesh spacing ∆x, the shape and size of the volume in which the electron

wave functions are calculated, and the step size ∆t of the time integration. We use a mesh

size ∆x = 0.25 ˚A, which is justiﬁed in the next section that examines atomic properties.

For the volume geometry we take a sphere of radius 6 ˚A. From experience with the jellium

model, the collective resonance frequency of Ag8 should be accurate to 0.1 eV with this box

size, and the smaller clusters will be described even more accurately. The last numerical

parameter ∆t must be small compared to the inverse energy scale of the Hamiltonian, which

in turn is controlled by ∆x in our method. We ﬁnd that the integration is stable and accurate

taking ∆t = 0.001 eV−1. The equations are integrated to a total time of T = 50 ¯h/eV . The

3

inverse of this time corresponds to the energy resolution of the theoretical spectrum.

III. ATOMIC PROPERTIES

Before presenting the results on silver clusters, we examine the accuracy of our three-

dimensional coordinate-space numerical method for atomic properties. We have considered

the TDLDA treatment of IB atoms in an earlier publication [16]. There we used a spherical

basis and the emphasis was on the validity of the pseudopotential approximation for calcu-

lating the response and its sum rule. Here we use those results to test the implementation of

the Kohn-Sham equations on a three-dimensional mesh, which of course is much more ineﬃ-

cient than the spherical representation for atomic systems. Comparison of the two methods

is given in Table I. We ﬁnd, with a mesh of 0.25 ˚A, that orbital energies are reproduced to

an accuracy of about 0.1 eV. The ground state conﬁguration of the Ag atom is d10s1 with

Kohn-Sham orbital energies of the d-, s-, and p-orbitals having values -7.8, -4.6 and -0.7 eV,

respectively. In the 3-d mesh, the lack of spherical symmetry also splits the d-orbitals by

about 0.1 eV. The intrinsic limitations of the TDLDA on physical quantities are certainly

beyond the 0.1 eV accuracy level, so we judged the 0.25 ˚A mesh adequate for our purposes.

We also show in the table some physical quantities of interest: the ionization potential, the

energy of the lowest excited state, and its oscillator strength. Although it is tempting to

interpret the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues as orbital energies, it is well known that the ionization

potential is not well reproduced by the highest electron’s eigenvalue. In our case here, the

negative of the s-orbital energy, 4.6 eV, is quite far from the empirical 7.5 eV ionization

potential. However, the LDA does much better when the total energies of the Ag atom and

the Ag+ ion are compared. We quote this number as ‘I.P.’ in the table. The next quantity

we examine is the excitation energy of the lowest excited state. The state has a predominant

d10p1 character; the diﬀerence in orbital energies is quoted as ‘ep −es’ in the table. The phys-

ical excitation energy including interaction eﬀects is shown on the line Ep¯s. The theoretical

values are obtained from the peak position in the Fourier transform of the TDLDA response.

4

We see that three-dimensional mesh agrees to 0.1 eV with the spherical basis calculation on

these energies. However, the experimental excitation energy is lower than theory by about

10%; this number sets the scale of the intrinsic limitations of the TDLDA. In the last line,

we display the oscillator strength associated with the transition between the ground and

excited state. Here there is some disagreement between the spherical results and the three-

dimensional results. This might be due to the diﬀerent treatment of the pseudopotential

in the two cases. The three-dimensional treatment used the Kleinman-Bylander method to

treat the nonlocality of the pseudopotential, while in the spherical basis, the l-dependent

nonlocality is treated exactly. In any case, the three-dimensional result is within 10% of the

empirical value. We also include in the table the energies associated with the excitation of

a d-electron to the p-orbital.

IV. SILVER DIMER AND TRIMER

We next examine the Ag2 dimer. We take the nuclear separation distance at 2.612 ˚A from

the calculations of ref. [19]. The response averaged over directions is shown in Fig. 2. The

s → p transition is split into two modes, a longitudinal mode at 3.2 eV and a transverse

mode at 4.9 eV. Experimentally, the dimer has only been studied in matrices which are

subject to environmental shifts of the order of tenths of an electron volt. Absorption peaks

have been identiﬁed at 3.0 eV and 4.7 eV which very likely correspond to the two modes

found theoretically. In emission, these states are shifted somewhat lower, to 2.8 and 4.5 eV.

These numbers are probably a better measure of the free cluster energies, judging by the

behavior of silver atoms in a matrix. The lower state is strongly coupled to vibrations in

the data of ref. [20], supporting the interpretation of the mode as a longitudinal excitation.

In summary, the TDLDA reproduces the splitting of the longitudinal and transverse modes

quite accurately, but the average frequency of the mode is probably too high by the same

amount that we found for the atom. We conclude that the interaction physics between the

two atoms is reasonably described by the TDLDA.

5

The picture of two nearly independent states on the two atoms is qualitatively valid also

in considering the oscillator strengths of the transitions. The theoretical ratio of strengths

for the two states is very close to 2:1, which is expected for the two transverse modes

compared to the single longitudinal mode. However, the total strength of the sharp states,

1.05 electrons, is only 80% of the theoretical strength for separated atoms. Thus a signiﬁcant

fraction of strength goes to a higher spectral region. We shall see that much of the shift is

to the region 5 eV to 6 eV, where experimental data is still available.

The silver trimer is predicted to have a shape of an isosceles triangle with nearly equal

sides. There are two nearly degenerate geometries (corresponding to the E symmetry of

the equilateral triangle) with the 2B state in an obtuse triangle predicted to be lowest in

most calculations. Our calculation uses the obtuse geometry (geometry I) of ref. [19]. The

absorption spectrum of Ag3 is shown in Fig. 3. We see that the absorption in the 3-5 eV

region is spread out among several states. The more complex spectrum may be due to the

low ionization potential of Ag3. According to the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue, the binding of

the highest occupied orbital is 3.5 eV, permitting Rydberg states in this region. There is

a quantum chemistry calculation of the spectral properties of Ag3 excitations in the visible

region of the spectrum [8]. This calculation predicted an integrated strength below 3.5 eV

of fE ≈ 0.6, neglecting the screening of the d-electrons. In comparison we ﬁnd for the same

integration limit fE = 0.1, a factor of 6 smaller.

V. AG8 AND AG+
9

We shall now see that collective features of the response become prominent going to 8-

electron clusters. In the alkali metals, clusters with 8 valence electrons have a sharp collective

resonance associated with a nearly spherical cluster shape and ﬁlled shells of the delocalized

orbitals. These systems have been modeled with the spherical jellium approximation, and

the gross features of the collective resonance are reproduced. The IB metals are quite

diﬀerent from the IA alkali metals, however, in that the occupied d-orbitals are close to the

6

Fermi surface and strongly screen the s-electrons. On the experimental side, the studies

of Ag8 [7] and Ag+

9 [2] seem to show that the oscillator strength of the s-electrons is not

seriously quenched by the d-polarizability. An important motivation of our study then is to

see whether the simple arguments made for a strong d-screening are in fact borne out by

the theory treating the d-electrons on an equal footing.

There are two competing geometries in eight-atom clusters of s-electron elements, having

Td and D2d symmetry. We have calculated the response of both geometries, taking the bond

lengths from ref. [19]. The optical absorption strength function is shown in Fig. 4. Also

shown with arrows are the two experimental absorption peaks seen in ref. [7]. The peak

locations agree very well with the theoretical spectrum based on the Td geometry. But

one should remember that the matrix spectrum is likely to be shifted by a few tenths of

an eV with respect to the free cluster spectrum. The experimental absorption strength is

considerably higher for the upper of the two peaks in the 3-4 eV region, which also agrees

with theory. The D2d geometry has a smaller splitting between the two peaks and does

not agree as well with the data. The theory thus favors the Td geometry for the ground

state. This is not the predicted ground state in ref. [19], but since the calculated energy

diﬀerence between geometries is only 0.08 eV, the theoretical ordering is uncertain. For

the Ag+

9 cluster, we used the geometry (I) of ref. [19], the predicted ground state of the

cluster in their most detailed calculation. The comparison between theory and experiment

[2] is shown in Fig. 6. The peak at 4 eV is reproduced in position; its theoretical width is

somewhat broadened due to the lower geometric symmetry of the 9-atom cluster.

We next turn to the integrated absorption strength. The strength function fE is shown

in Fig. 5 for Ag8 in the Td and D2d geometries; the results for Ag+

9 are shown in Fig. 7.

The sharp modes below 5 eV are predicted to have only 25% of the s-electron sum rule.

This is slightly higher than the Mie theory prediction, which perhaps can be attributed to

the imperfect screening in a small cluster. The same physics is responsible for the blue

shift of the excitation in small clusters. Although the sharp states are strongly screened,

the integrated strength below 6 eV is 3.9 electrons, about 50% of the s-electron sum. The

7

integrated strength data is compared with theory in Fig. 8, showing all the trend with

increasing cluster size. The integrated strength per s-electron has moderate decrease with

increasing cluster size; no trend is discernible in the experimental data. Beyond N=1, the

experimentally measured strength is substantially larger than theory predicts. The data of

ref. [2] is about a factor of two larger than theory, as may also be seen in Fig. 7. However, it

is diﬃcult to assess the errors in that measurement, and the data of ref. [7] is not seriously

out of disagreement in view of their assigned error bars. From a theoretically point of view,

it is diﬃcult to avoid the d-electron screening and the resulting strong reduction of the

strength. We present in the next section a semianalytic argument on this point.

VI. INTERPRETATION

In this section we will analyze the d-electron contribution to the TDLDA response from

an atomic point of view.

In the TDLDA, the bound electrons can be treated separately

because they only interact through the common mean ﬁeld.

In particular, there are no

Pauli exclusions corrections when combining s → p and d → p transition strength. To

describe the response from an atomic point of view, it is convenient to express it in terms

of the dynamic polarizability α(ω). We remind the reader that it is related to the strength

function S(E) = dfE/dE by

α(ω) =

∞

−ω2 + E2 .

The data in Table I may be used to estimate the d → p polarizability function, but this would

not include higher energy contributions and the continuum d → f transitions. Instead, we

recomputed the atomic silver response freezing the s-electron. That procedure yielded a

polarizability function with values α(0 eV) = 1.8 ˚A3 and α(4 eV) = 2.1 ˚A3. We then ﬁt this

to a convenient single-state resonance form,

with ﬁt parameters fd = 1.89 and Ed = 10.7 eV, from which we can analytically calculate the

eﬀects on the s-electron response. Except for minor interaction terms the TDLDA response

is equivalent to the RPA, which we apply using the response formalism as in App. A of

ref. [22]. Note that the dipole response function Π is related to the polarizability α by

Π = α/e2. Alternatively, the same physics can be derived using the dielectric functions, as

was done in ref. [1,3,4]. The formulations are equivalent provided the dielectric function and

the polarizability satisfy the Clausius-Mossotti relation. In the dipole response formalism,

it is convenient to represent the uncoupled response function as a 2 × 2 matrix, separating

the free-electron and the polarizability contributions. The RPA response function is written

as

ΠRP A = (1, 1)(1 + Π0V)−1Π0(1, 1)t

where Π0 and V are the following 2 × 2 matrices:

Π0 =

Here N is the number of atoms in the cluster, and R is the radius of the cluster. The

form for Π0 is obvious, with the free electron response given by Π0

V is more subtle. The Coulomb interaction, represented by the long-range dipole-dipole

coupling e2~r1 · ~r2/R3 [23], acts among the free electrons and between the free electrons and

the polarization charge, but not within the polarization charges— separated dipoles have

zero interaction after averaging over angular orientations. The algebra in eq. (4) is easily

carried out to give

ΠRP A =

N¯h2/m (1 − αd/r3

where rs = (V /N)1/3 and ωM is the free-electron resonance frequency deﬁned in the intro-

duction. The pole position of the response gives the frequency with the polarization,

Taking rs = 3.09 and αd from the atomic calculation, we ﬁnd the resonance shifted from 5.18

to 3.6 eV, i.e. exactly the value for the empirical Mie theory. . The strength is calculated

from the energy times the residue of the pole which yields

Numerically, eq. (9) gives a factor of 4 reduction in the strength, consistent with the full

TDLDA calculation for Ag8 with the s + d valence space. We thus conclude that the d-

polarization eﬀects can be quite simply understood in atomic terms.

Small rare gas clusters in soft X-ray pulses

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

We develop a microscopic model for the interaction of small rare gas clusters with soft X-ray radi-
ation. It is shown that, while the overall charging of the clusters is rather low, unexpectedly high
atomic charge states can arise due to charge imbalances inside the cluster. The mechanism does
not require unusually high absorption rates, and the heating can be described by standard inverse
bremsstrahlung formulae.

The interaction of strong lasers with atomic and molec-
ular systems at optical frequencies has become a vivid
ﬁeld of research, triggering new developments on both,
the experimental and the theoretical side [1]. For clus-
ters, an important aspect has been the strongly increased
energy absorption compared to the single atom case. The
mechanisms for this phenomenon diﬀer dependent on the
size of the cluster. They reach from enhanced ionization
for small clusters [2], also known from molecules, over a
resonant coupling of the laser frequency ω to an collec-
tively oscillating electron cloud in intermediate clusters
[3], to plasma osicllations whose resonant coupling to the
laser frequency are believed to make energy absorption
eﬀective in very large clusters [4]. The order of magni-
tude of the absorbed energy and the observation of highly
charged ions and energetic particles could be clearly re-
produced by the corresponding calculations. On the ba-
sis of the insight gained so far, it seemed clear that in
a frequency regime where neither a resonant coupling to
the laser frequency is accessible nor the inverse laser fre-
quency is large enough to allow for a quasistatic descrip-
tion, enhanced energy absorption in clusters should not
occur.
Hence, it came quite as a surprise when the ﬁrst XFEL
experiment at the DESY in Hamburg [5], using soft X-
ray radiation with ω = 12.7 eV and Xenon clusters of
up to 30000 atoms, revealed a complete breakup of the
clusters and ﬁnal ionic charge states of 4+ for clusters
with NAtom
30000,
even more, since the maximum intensity was only I =
1013 W/cm2. At this intensity, single Xenon atoms
7
could only be ionized once by absorbing a single pho-
ton, which is just enough to overcome the ﬁrst ionization
threshold of Xenon (12.1 eV). Obviously, multiphoton
processes do not play a role.
On the other hand, the (surface) plasmon frequency of
a spherical nanoplasma with radius R, consisting of N
atoms with charge Z and Nel ≤

which would require charge states of Z > 16 for the

XFEL frequency to come into resonance with the plasma
frequency in the case of a Xe cluster. This seems ex-
tremely unlikely. Moreover, due to the expected expan-
sion of the cluster, Z would have to be shifted towards
even higher values during the interaction with the pulse.
To summarize, none of the concepts from the IR regime
can be taken over to the case of VUV pulses.
In this letter we present a theoretical explanation of
the observed phenomenon, based on a mixed quantum-
classical model. Although the situation is quite diﬀerent
from the IR case, the high charge states can once again
be explained from the fact that a cluster is a dense, but
ﬁnite system, i.e., neither an atom nor a quasi-inﬁnite
solid or plasma. We consider relatively small (N < 100)
Xenon clusters in a short, soft X-ray pulse. The model
we have developed is microscopic, allowing to follow all
particles and their mutual interactions in time.
As it will become clear below, the concept of inner and
outer ionization, originally introduced for the case of IR
pulses [7] is equally useful in the VUV case. Inner ioniza-
tion means the ionization of an electron from its mother
atom (ion), whereas outer ionization denotes the process
of an electron leaving the cluster as a whole. Akin to
our previously developed model for rare gas clusters in
IR ﬁelds [2], we treat the inner ionization process us-
ing quantum mechanical photo absorption rates while all
subsequent time evolution, including outer ionization, is
described by classical mechanics.
Whereas in the case of a single Xe atom double ionization
with two photons is energetically forbidden, multiple in-
ner ionization can take place in a cluster due to the inﬂu-
ence of the neighbouring ions. The situation is illustrated
in Fig. 1: the interionic barriers are pulled down by the
surrounding charges, so that the diﬀerence ∆E in energy
between the level to be ionized and the top of the near-
est barrier becomes less than the energy of one photon.
Consequently, in our treatment an electron can be inner-
ionized as long as ω > ∆E. If such a photon is absorbed,
its energy is transferred into kinetic energy of the electron
= √2ω) and the electron is henceforth treated
(i.e.
as a classical particle, starting its trajectory at the nu-

ion, one photon is suﬃcient to achieve inner ionization in the
case of the cluster.

cleus with momentum p. We use specially adapted soft
core potentials for the classical electron-ion-interaction
as in [2] to avoid numerical singularities and unphysical
autoionization processes. The initial conﬁguration of the
cluster atoms is determined assuming pairwise Lennard-
Jones interaction [8].

The probability of an atom or ion absorbing a photon
is calculated using atomic photoabsorption cross sections
[9]. This is justiﬁed since these cross sections can be
derived using the reﬂection principle [10], where the elec-
tronic wave function has to be evaluated only once at a
distance rω = ω−1/2 from the nucleus. In our case this
gives rω = 1.46 a.u., which is small enough to assume
that the atomic wave function at rω is hardly changed
by the presence of the neighbouring cluster atoms (at
least in the case of van der Waals clusters).
The inner-ionized electrons, together with the ions cre-
ated by the ionization process, form a nanoplasma which
is described classically in our calculation. Here, we do
not take into account e-2e processes since the mean free
path for electron-ion-scattering is much larger than the
cluster size [11]. Hence, transfer of thermal energy from
the nanoplasma electrons to electrons still bound is not
accounted for. However, the electrons will transfer ther-
mal energy to the ions causing a slow expansion of the
cluster even if, as a whole, it would stay neutral (hydro-
dynamic expansion, cf. [4]).
This is of course not the case: The initial energy the
electrons get from the photons is only suﬃcient for the
ﬁrst few electrons to leave the cluster before its increasing
charge starts to hold them back. The remaining electrons
will evolve into a Maxwellian velocity distribution so that
in the course of time more electrons will gain suﬃcient
kinetic energy to outer ionize. Moreover, there is the
possibility of inverse bremsstrahlung processes which are

included on the classical level: the electrons can absorb
energy from the laser ﬁeld when undergoing collisions
with the ions in the cluster. We will see later that this
process leads to a considerable heating of the nanoplasma
electrons, causing further outer ionization.
First of all, however, we shall examine the time depen-
dence of characteristic observables. Fig. 2 shows the to-
tal energy of the system, the mean internuclear distance,
the number of inner-ionized electrons and the number of
electrons with positive energy (i.e., the number of outer-
ionized electrons). The pulse parameters are as indicated
in the ﬁgure caption.

We see that the scenario is qualitatively the same as for
IR pulses: after the ﬁrst electrons have left the cluster,
the ions start to repel each other so that the mean inter-
nuclear distance slowly increases, and the cluster com-
pletely disintegrates into ions and atoms. However, the
whole process is much less violent in the VUV case: only
about 550 eV per atom are absorbed, at least one or-
der of magnitude less than in IR pulses (however, one
order of magnitude more than in the case of an isolated
atom). Due to barrier suppression almost 8 electrons
per Xe atom are inner-ionized. The number of outer-
ionized electrons is still slowly increasing well after the
end of the pulse, since, due to continuing rethermaliza-
tion, some electrons can aquire suﬃcient kinetic energy
to leave the cluster.
Note, that the ﬁnal average charge per atom is only
about 1.5. Nevertheless, charges up to 5+ can be ob-

served. Before we come to this point, we must clarify
the mechanism of energy absorption. The cluster can
absorb energy in two ways: ﬁrstly, if an electron is inner-
ionized the energy of the cluster increases by ω. Secondly,
inner-ionized electrons inside the cluster can absorb en-
ergy by inverse bremsstrahlung (IBS) when colliding with
the ions. The average rate of energy absorption by IBS
for a Maxwellian distribution of electrons with tempera-
ture T colliding with ions of charge Z and density ni in
a ﬁeld of intensity I and frequency ω is [12]

In Fig. 2a we analyze the contributions to energy ab-
sorption from single photon absorption leading to in-
ner ionization (Eii) and from the subsequent IBS pro-
cesses (EIBS).
IBS contributes about 80 % to the ab-
sorbed energy as one can see comparing the full curve
Etot with the short-dashed one (Eii). EIBS can be cal-
culated directly with Eq. 2 taking T = 2/3
to
be the (time-dependent) temperature of the electrons in-
side the cluster. The result (long-dashed line) is too high
which can be understood since Eq. 2 is strictly valid only
when plasma screening eﬀects can be neglected, which
means that the Debye length
T /(4πZni) should be
much larger than the distance between neigbouring ions.
This condition is not fulﬁlled in our case, so that the ef-
fective ionic charge seen by the electrons is smaller by a
certain factor f , or, equivalently, the energy absorption
is smaller by a factor f 2. With f 2 = 0.6, one obtains
E′
EIBS + Eii shown as dotted line in Fig. 2a in
good agreement with the numerical result Etot.
We now turn our attention to the distribution of ionic
charges one observes when the cluster has completely
disintegrated. The charge spectrum for Xe80 after being
irridiated by the pulse from Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3.
First of all, charge states of up to 5+ can be observed in
the focus of the pulse (Fig. 3 a)). To compare our results
to the measurements in [5], one i) has to integrate over
the spatial intensity distribution of the FEL laser and ii)
would have to take into account the geometrical detector
acceptance for diﬀerent charge states, which can only be
calculated from the detailed experimental setup and has
not yet been included in the experimental results [15].
However, with the integration over the Gaussian beam
proﬁle performed, we can at least qualitatively compare
our theoretical results with the experiment, as shown in
Fig. 3b. Note that the yield of ions with charges of ﬁve or
higher is negligible for Xe80 when the volume integration
is performed, which coincides well with the experimental
ﬁndings.

The probably most surprising feature are the high
charge states, observed in the experiment and obtained
in our calculation.
In a recent theoretical work [13] it
has been proposed that the high charge states in large

clusters (NAtom > 1000) are due to thermal equilibration
among the particles. While thermal eﬀects might inﬂu-
ence the distribution of the lower charge states, at least
for smaller clusters studied here, the highest charge states
arise due to the ﬁnite volume of a cluster which leads to
large charge gradients. For simplicity, we will discuss the
case of spherical symmetry in the following. It is known
from the laws of electrostatics that a particle with charge
q located at a distance rq from the center of a spherically
symmetric charge distribution with density ρ(r) interacts
with this charge distribution as if it was a point charge
rq
at the center of strength Q(rq) =
0 ρ(r) dr. A homo-
geneous density ρ(r) = ρ0 leads to Q = 4
q . Baring
in mind the r−2 dependence of the Coulomb force, an
electron inside a positive, spherically symmetric charge
density behaves like a harmonic oscillator (which is just
where the surface plasmon comes from). For this rea-
son, once a few electrons with high kinetic energy have
left the cluster, the remaining electrons will be pulled to-
wards the center of the cluster, leaving the ions of the
outermost shell essentially stripped [16].
This scenario is conﬁrmed by the time evolution of the
radial electron and ion densities during the pulse. From
Fig. 4 it is clear that, once the sum of ionic charges ex-
ceeds the integrated electron density, the electrons tend
to neutralize the inner part of the cluster (which in this
case consists basically of two ionic shells). Hence, while
the outer ionic shells starts already to explode during
the time covered by Fig. 4 (charge center of the outer
shell at about 20 a.u. in (c) and at more than 25 a.u. in
(d)), the inner ionic shell, shielded by the remaining elec-
trons, does not expand, rather its charge center remains
at about 12 a.u.. The border between the neutral and
the charged part of the cluster is not completely sharp, as
the electrons possess a ﬁnite temperature which broadens
their radial distribution, leading to a smooth distribution
of ionic charges.

Hence, our calculations indeed conﬁrm the aforemen-
tioned picture for the emergence of high charge states:
it is the ﬁnite size of the cluster which leads to signiﬁ-

cant charge imbalances inside the cluster, and the highest
ionic charges are therefore generated in the outer shell of
the cluster. For simplicity, we have illustrated this ef-
fect with a spherical cluster. However, any geometric ar-
rangement of the ions which has a clear ”center” will lead
to a strong charge gradient. What is required, however,
is a negligible ponderomotive oscillation of the electrons
due to the external ﬁeld.
In the VUV case the oscil-
lation amplitude is √I/ω2 < 0.2 a.u. and hence much
smaller than the interionic distances. For IR pulses the
electrons are ﬁeld-driven throughout the whole cluster, so
that any kind of charge imbalance is washed out. On the
other hand, the laser frequency should be small enough
to allow for signiﬁcant IBS heating: as can be seen from
Eq. 2, the rate of energy absorption decreases quadrati-
cally with the applied frequency. This is why our results
should not apply to the case of keV photons [14].
Note that the appeareance of higher charges at the bor-
der of the cluster has to be paid oﬀ by some neutral
atoms in the center of the cluster (which also disintegrate
due to hydrodynamic expansion). These neutral atoms,
however, could not be detected in the DESY experiment
[15]. In other words, only the relative abundance of ions
has been measured, with the number of ”dark” neutral
atoms left unknown. This leads us to the question of
the relevance of our results for the case of larger clus-
ters, i.e. N > 1000. We expect the diﬀerence between
electronic and ionic density at the surface of the cluster
to be even bigger than for small clusters, since the space
charge will be higher too. Thus, the maximum charge
state attainable by charge imbalance will increase with
the cluster size. On the other hand, the relative pro-
portion of the surface region to the total volume of the

4

cluster will decrease, leaving relatively more neutralized
ions in the center of the cluster. As mentioned, these neu-
tral atoms would have been invisible in the experiment;
the relative abundance, however, might well be reprodu-
cable by our model even for larger clusters. Moreover, a
new set of experiments is planned at DESY where, e.g.,
Argon clusters can be doped with a single Xenon atom
which can be placed in the center of the cluster or at the
surface, respectively [15]. This kind of experiment could
directly verify the predictions made by our model.
To summarize, we have presented a microscopic model
which simulates the time evolution of rare gas clusters in
VUV laser ﬁelds. Single-photon processes, leading only
to single ionization for isolated Xenon atoms, can create
a dense nanoplasma in the case of a cluster because in-
ner ionization is facilitated by the charged environment
of a cluster atom, eﬀectively reducing the threshold for
ionization. Once the nanoplasma is formed, the energy
absorption and ﬁnal average ionic charge turn out to be
within the limits set by standard inverse bremsstrahlung
theory; nevertheless, the geometric properties of clusters
lead to unusually high charge states originating from the
surface region of the cluster.

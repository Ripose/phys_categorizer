Abstract

We propose the generalization of a known established empirically (Wahl W.
and Wucher A. Nucl. Instrum. Meth. B 94, 36(1994)) power law, describing
relative mass-spectra of neutral sputtered clusters, on the cases of arbitrary clus-

ter charges. The ﬂuctuation mechanism of charge state formation of sputtering

products in the form of large clusters with the number of atoms N

5 is also

proposed. The simple formula obtained by us has been shown a good agreement

≥

with the experimental data.

Sputtering of solids under the ion bombardment is one of the main

applied and fundamental problems which is importance in the many

directions of contemporary science and technology. Considerable tech-

nological possibilities in the micro- and nanoelectronics, cosmic and

thermonuclear technologies have stimulated increase of the number of

works devoted to application and basic investigations of sputtering phe-

nomenon (see, for example, recent reviews [1-3] and references therein).

The theoretical description and estimations of sputtering processes are

rather diﬃcult due to the multiparticle character of problem both at the

stage of ion penetration to solid and at the stage of formation sputtering

products which consist of not only single target atoms but also polyi-

atomic particles, i.e., clusters. Presently, some perspectives on carrying

out of ”ﬁrst principle” calculations are connected (see, also, estimates

[4,5]) with computer simulation by molecular dynamics methods. How-

ever, such calculations are complicated in technical plan, especially in the

case of increasing of the number of atoms in cluster and they are diﬃcult

for performing excluding the authors of these calculations.. The maximal

using of possibilities of empirically established sputtering regularities is

reasonable in this case. For cluster sputtering so-called power law for rel-

ative neutral cluster yield which was discovered experimentally (see for

instance [6]) could be most important. According to this the norlmalized
neutral cluster yield is described by the law N ξ, where N is the number

of atoms in the cluster and the parameter ξ depends on bombardment

conditions and target type. One of most complex problems is also pro-

cess of charge state formation of surface sputtering products. Consid-

erable number of experimental and theoretical works are devoted (see,

for example, review [7]) to the investigations of charge state formation

of single atomic particles at the surface scattering or sputtering of metal

surface. On other hand, the mechanism of charged structure formation

1

of polyatomic particles had been less investigated both theoretically and

experimentally. In this paper the generalization of well known empiri-

cally established power law describing relative mass-spectra of neutral

clusters for cluster emission of arbitrary charges is oﬀered. The ﬂuc-

tuation mechanism of charge state formation of sputtering products in

form of large clusters with the number of atoms N

5 is also proposed.

Derived simple formulas are in a good accordance with the experimental

≥

data. We use the old conception according to which large clusters are

emitted as a whole agglomerate in the form of block of atoms (see also

[8,9]) . We will consider the probability WN of events corresponding to

correlated movement of N -atomic block as given. Let us determine the

charged state of the block of N-atoms. For this purpose we will follow

the statistical deriving of Saha-Lengmuir’s formula [10], and assume that

with moving oﬀ of the cluster from the metal surface up to some distance

(so-called critical distance) the exchange between the electrons of metal

conduction zone and electrons of cluster atoms is possible. When cluster

moves away from the metal surface to the distance exceeding critical

one, the electron exchange stop unadiabatically. Further below saying

about cluster electrons, we will mean valence electrons only and corre-

sponding aggregate of states we will call the cluster conduction zone.

We will also assume that namely between the zones of metal and cluster

the exchange is possible. Then average number of electrons nτ on the

energy electron level ετ of cluster, according to the Fermi distribution, is

tion zone is Ne. Then, according to deﬁnition, the average of square

deviation of number of electron in cluster conduction zone from average

τ ∆n2
τ . The cluster, having Ne electrons
in conduction zone, will be electrically neutral, if Ne = Ne, where Ne

is the average number of electrons in the cluster conduction zone which

is equal to the number of atoms in N -atomic cluster multiplied to va-

lency γ (i.e., to the number of atomic electrons, yelding by neutral metal
atom to the conduction zone). Thus, cluster charge is Qe = (Ne −
where e is electron charge. Further calculations with these formulae

N γ)e,

require knowledge of the electronic structure of cluster and generally

speaking cannot be performed in general form. However, if to consider

cluster size is large enough and electronic states are quasi-continuous,

one can exchange summing over the electronic states on integration over

the zone [11]. Therefore, for the temperatures less than the degeneration

1In principle, equality to zero of equilibrium cluster charge follows from the assumption that Fermi
levels in cluster and metal coincide. If it is not executed, asymmetry between positive and negative

charged clusters will be observed and corresponding changes in following formulas can be easy made.

Obviously, our consideration is not applicable for the sputtering of single

atoms or small clusters. From comparison with the experimental data

one can made a conclusion (see also [8,9]) on applicability of the model

beginning from the concrete number of cluster atoms ( N

5). In exper-

iment one measures, usually, the relative probabilities of the cluster yield

with diﬀerent number of atoms. Therefore, to compare theoretical data

≥

with the experiment ones, one should at ﬁrst divide the probability (6) to

the probability of cluster emission with ( 6) N = 5 (more exactly, we can

5, but it is more conveniently for us, when N = 5

choose any value N
) , i.e. Y Q

≥
N /W Q
5 . The experimental data will be same normalized.
Farther, if it is necessary, one can pass to arbitrary convenient system of

N = W Q

units. The results of analysis of the general formulas and performed nu-

merical calculations and experimental data which are given in Figs. 1-3

allow to come to the following conclusions: a) The charge state changes

by the variation of target temperature, moreover the ionization coeﬃ-

cients increase by increasing of the temperature; b) relative mass-spectra

of the neutral clusters do not depend on target temperature, while rel-

ative mass-spectra of charged clusters depend on it very strongly, but

by increasing of temperature they approach to mass-spectra of neutral

clusters; c) the more cluster charge, the more seldom they are found; for

example, the number of clusters with charge 2, as a rule, less than the

number of clusters with charge 1; d) large clusters are ionized in larger

5

6
degree; e) tendency to saturation of ionization coeﬃcients with growth

of cluster dimension is an important peculiarity, qualitatively the same

behavior has been noted in experiments [12], that conﬁrms the conclu-

sions about coincidence of the relative mass-spectra of charged clusters

with neutral ones, when values of N are large (i.e., when N

1) ). As

it is well known, the experimental registration of the charged clusters

≫

is simpler technically than one of neutral clusters. Therefore the data

of measurements of charged clusters allow restoring of neutral clusters

distribution indirectly and experimental set up is simpliﬁed very much.

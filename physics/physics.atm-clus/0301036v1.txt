The pair correlations in mesoscopic systems such as nm-size superconducting clusters and nuclei
are studied at ﬁnite temperature for the canonical ensemble of fermions in model spaces with a ﬁxed
particle number: i) a degenerate spherical shell (strong coupling limit), ii) an equidistantly spaced
deformed shell (weak coupling limit). It is shown that after the destruction of the pair correlations at
T = 0 by a strong magnetic ﬁeld or rapid rotation, heating can bring them back. This phenomenon
is a consequence of the ﬁxed number of fermions in the canonical ensemble.

PACS numbers: 71.10.Li, 74.20.Fg

The pair correlations in a macroscopic superconduc-
tor are destroyed by increasing the temperature or the
external magnetic ﬁeld. The critical ﬁeld which marks
the boundary between the superconducting and normal
phases, is a decreasing function of the temperature T .
The BCS theory, which is the mean ﬁeld approximation
based on the grand canonical ensemble, describes very
accurately this regime. Applying the grand canonical
mean ﬁeld approach to rotating nuclei [1], where the an-
gular velocity plays the role of the magnetic ﬁeld, gives
an analogous result: The angular velocity where the pair
correlations disappear decreases with the temperature.
Nuclei and atomic nano-size clusters are composed of a
small and ﬁxed number of particles, the single-particle
spectrum is discrete and the level spacing is comparable
with the pair gap. Due to these facts, the ﬂuctuations
of the order parameter become important, which smear
out the transition from superconducting to normal phase
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and lead to pronounced diﬀerences between
a system with even and odd particle number [6].

In order to properly take into account these ﬂuctua-
tions one has to use the canonical ensemble. The most di-
rect way is to calculate the partition function from the ex-
act eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian, which is possible for
some models. In this Letter we study the simple model
of fermions occupying an isolated shell of single parti-
cle states and interacting by a pairing force. We shall
demonstrate that at zero temperature the magnetic ﬁeld
or the angular velocity attenuate the paring in a step-wise
manner until it disappears completely above a critical
value. For a mesoscopic system in the strong magnetic
ﬁeld heating may bring back the pair correlations. This
surprising eﬀect is a consequence of the ﬁxed number of
fermions in such a small system. The reduction of the
ﬂuctuations in particle number leads to a strong increase
of the ﬂuctuations of the order parameter, which con-
stitute the pair correlations above the critical ﬁeld. A
re-entrance of pair correlations has ﬁrst been discussed
by Balian, Flocard and Veneroni [6], who studied ensem-
bles with either only even numbers of particles or only
odd numbers of particles. We shall demonstrate that the

more stringent restriction to a ﬁxed number of particles,
which is realized in small systems, leads to qualitatively
diﬀerent results.

First we consider fermions in a spherical potential.
Then the electronic states in the cluster (the spin-orbit
coupling can be neglected) are characterized by l, the or-
bital momentum of the shell, its z-projection λ and spin
projection σ, which we label by k = {λ, σ}. The condi-
tion, k > 0, used below in Eq. (1), means that λ + σ > 0.
Due to the strong spin-orbit splitting in nuclei the nucle-
onic states in a shell are speciﬁed by the total angular
momentum j, (~j = ~l + ~s), and its projection m ≡ k.
We assume that there are only pair correlations within
the last partially ﬁlled shell. The corresponding ”single-
shell” Hamiltonian

H = Hpair − ωM, M = Lz + gSz,
k a+
a+
Hpair = −GA+A, A+ = X
¯k ,
k>0

(1)

consists of the pairing interaction Hpair, which acts be-
tween the valence fermions in the last shell with the
strength G, and the “cranking term”. The z-components
of the total orbital angular momentum and spin, which
are the sums of all valence fermion contributions, are de-
noted by Lz and Sz. The operator A+ creates a fermion
pair in the time-reversal states (k, ¯k). In the case of clus-
ters, the cranking term represents the interaction of the
electrons with the magnetic-ﬁeld, where we introduce the
Larmour frequency ω = µBB and the Bohr magneton
µB. The gyromagnetic ratio g = 2. In the case of nu-
clei, the cranking term takes into account the rotational
perturbations at the angular frequency ω and g = 1.

The eigenvalues of Hpair(ω = 0) are [7]

were Nsh is the number of particles in the shell, which
consists of Ω degenerated single-particle states and Ω =
4l + 2 for clusters and 2j + 1 for nuclei. The seniority ν,
which is the number of unpaired particles, is constrained

by 0 ≤ ν ≤ Nsh. We assume that ν ≤ Ω/2, otherwise
one can pass to the hole representation. Each ν-state at
ν ≥ 1 is degenerated. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
(1) are

The index i involves additional quantum numbers of the
ν-state including the spin and possible orbital momenta
and their z-projections for clusters or the total angular
momentum of ν nucleons and its projection for nuclei. In
the case of clusters, µBMν,i is the total magnetic moment
of ν particles while in nuclei Mν,i is the angular momen-
tum z projection of ν nucleons. For simplicity, we refer
to M as the angular momentum and omit the index i
for the states with minimal energy at each ν, which have
maximal Mν.

The canonical partition function Z and the mean value

The evaluation uses the fact that for each ν the sum over
i can be reduced to a sum over single-particle projections.
For nuclei, the numerical diagonalization procedure de-
scribed in Ref. [8] is used, which permits us also to treat
a non-degenerate shell (see below). We consider only
the part of ¯M which is generated by the particles near
the Fermi surface that participate in the pair correlation.
The contributions for the other particles can be found in
ref. [9] and will be discussed together with the details of
the evaluation of the sums for clusters in an forthcoming
extended paper [10].

We introduce the “canonical” pair gap ∆can as a mea-

where |ν, i, 0i denote the uncorrelated fermion conﬁg-
urations in the shell. The second term subtracts the
expectation value of the pairing interaction in an en-
semble of uncorrelated fermions. A detailed discussion
of the proper deﬁnition of ∆can was given in the re-
view [3]. Applying the mean-ﬁeld approximation and
the grand canonical ensemble to our model, the thus in-
troduced ∆can becomes the familiar BCS gap parame-
ter ∆mf . However, ∆can must be clearly distinguished
from ∆mf because it incorporates the correlations caused
by the ﬂuctuations of the order parameter. We take as
energy scale E(0) = GΩ/4, the quasiparticle energy at
T = ω = 0. A value of E(0) = 0.3 − 0.4 meV was found
for Al-clusters with radii R = 5 − 10 nm [11], which sets

the energy scale. The nuclear mass measurements give
E(0) = 0.8 − 1.5 M eV . Let us ﬁrst consider the destruc-
tion of the pair correlations at T = 0. Since Mν increases
with ν, the energy Eν (ω) becomes smaller than Eν−2(ω)
at the frequency

ων(Mν − Mν−2) = Eν − Eν−2.

When the state of the lowest energy changes from ν − 2
to ν, two more electron states are blocked and the pair
correlations are reduced. The last step at the critical fre-
quency ωcrit leads to the maximal seniority νmax, where
all particle states are blocked and the pairing is com-
pletely destroyed. Fig. 1 illustrates the step-wise de-
struction of pairing by blocking for a half-ﬁlled l = 5
shell, which is the Fermi level in a spherical Al-cluster
with about 103 atoms.

Fig. 1 also shows the gap ∆mf (ω, T ) obtained by ap-
plying the mean-ﬁeld approximation (cf. [7, 9]) to the

more rapidly destroyed than for the exact solution. The
quantal ﬂuctuations of the order parameter generate ad-
ditional pair correlations. For ﬁnite T , the mean-ﬁeld
gap behaves as known from macroscopic superconduc-
tors: ∆mf (ω, T ) is reduced at T = 0.4E(0) and reaches 0
at a lower value of ω. This is the familiar shift of the crit-
ical frequency ωcrit toward smaller values with increasing
T . However, the canonical gap ∆can(ω, T ) behaves diﬀer-
ently: The abrupt drop around ωcrit is smoothed out by
the ﬂuctuations of the order parameter. Moreover sub-
stantial pair correlations appear in the region above ωcrit,
which increase with T . The comparison with ∆mf (ω, T )
shows that the ﬂuctuations contribute more at ﬁnite T
than at T = 0. For T = E(0), the pair correlations fall oﬀ
very gradually with ω. The nuclear case is quite similar.
Fig. 2 shows how these temperature-induced pair cor-
relations appear with increasing T . For ω = 0, there is a
pronounced drop of ∆can around Tcrit(ω = 0) = E(0)/2,
where the mean-ﬁeld gap ∆mf goes to zero. Above this
temperature there is a long tail of pair correlations caused
by the ﬂuctuations. For ω = 0.05 E(0), the drop is
shifted to smaller T by about the same amount as the
Tcrit of the mean-ﬁeld solution (not shown). This trend
continues for ω = 0.1 E(0). For larger ω ≥ ωcrit, the
pair-correlations built up with increasing T .

The temperature-induced pairing can be understood in
the following way. At T = 0, all electrons are unpaired
when the state of the maximum seniority becomes the
ground state for ω > ωcrit. At T > 0, excited states
with lower seniorities enter the canonical ensemble, which
reintroduce the pair correlations.

The degenerate spherical shell corresponds to the
strong coupling limit (∆/d ≫ 1, d distance between the
levels) of ref. [6]. For ω = 0, one may compare ∆can
of the present work with ∆F obtained for the ensemble
with good particle number parity in ref. [6], which we
will refer to as BVF in what follows. For T < 0.5 Tcrit,
both are similar. However for T > Tcrit, ∆F = 0 whereas
∆can remains ﬁnite up much higher temperatures. The
case ω 6= 0 is not shown in ref. [6] for the strong coupling
limit.

In order to investigate the consequence of deviations
from the spherical symmetry, we used the deformed shell-
model described in [8]. The Hamiltonian is given by

The solutions are found by numerical diagonalization in
the conﬁguration space of a j-shell.

Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the case of a cluster without
spherical symmetry. The half- ﬁlled shell consists of
12 equidistant levels, each of which contains two states
with spin up and down. Our choice of the level distance
d = 0.85 E(0) corresponds to weak coupling ∆ ≈ d and
is realistic for the nano-clusters. We assume an irregular
cluster shape. As a consequence, the orbital momentum
is quenched and only the spins contribute to the magnetic

ilar to the spherical case. The step-wise destruction of
the pair correlations corresponds to subsequent spin ﬂips
of electrons, which increase M by 2. The temperature-
induced pairing appears in the region above ω ∼ 2 d. The
spin ﬂips have been observed in tunneling experiments
on Al nano-clusters [3]. The mean-ﬁeld gap ∆mf (T = 0)
breaks down at the ﬁrst ﬂip, as discussed by Braun et
al.
[12] in their analysis of the tunneling spectra based
on the mean-ﬁeld approximation. However, ∆can(T = 0)
is more stable and disappears only after all levels are
blocked by subsequent spin ﬂips. Fig. 5 demonstrates
that the temperature dependence of ∆can is qualitatively
similar to the strong coupling case in Fig. 2. A new
feature is that sometimes ∆odd

means two states are blocked in the even but only one
in the odd system. For ω = 4d the analogous happens
at the third crossing. In the region of high temperatures
(T > 2Tcrit) the canonical pairing gaps for odd and even
systems practically coincide because all members of Z
contribute with a similar weight. At small T they diﬀer
because only the states with small seniorities are impor-
tant.

Our choice of parameters lies between to the weak cou-
pling cases ∆/d = 1.14 and 1.19 of the grand canonical
ensembles with even or odd particle number studied by
BVF (∆/d = wF ∆ in [6]). As in the case of strong
coupling, ∆can decreases very gradually for T > Tcrit,
whereas ∆F of BVF drops sharply to zero at Tcrit. How-
ever, also in the region T < Tcrit the results of the two ap-
proaches are diﬀerent. The diﬀerences between the even
and odd systems are much less pronounced in the canon-
ical ensemble. For ω = 0, ∆/d = 1.14, and odd particle
number, BVF ﬁnd ∆F = 0 for T < 0.2 Tcrit, ∆F 6= 0 for
0.2 Tcrit < T < Tcrit, and ∆F = 0 for T > Tcrit, which
they called the re-entrance phenomenon of pairing. As
seen in Fig. 5, the strong ﬂuctuations in the canonical
ensemble keep ∆can ﬁnite in the whole temperature inter-
val, i. e. there is no re-entrance of pairing for ω = 0 and

odd particle number. On the other hand, the canonical
ensemble gives temperature-induced pair correlations for
ω > 2 d both for even and odd particle number, which has
not been found for grand-canonical ensembles with ﬁxed
the particle number parity. It should be mentioned that
BVF considered a systems with N = 100, 101 whereas
we studied systems with N ∼ 10, for which the conser-
vation of particle number is more important.

We have also studied the case of a half-ﬁlled j = 11/2
shell in a deformed axial nucleus by assuming that ek
in Eq. (8) is proportional to k2. We chose the distance
e7/2 − e5/2 = 0.28 E(0), which is realistic. If the axis of
rotation is parallel to the symmetry axis, the behavior is
similar to the deformed clusters, except the steps in M
are diﬀerent from 2. If the axis of rotation is perpendicu-
lar to the symmetry axis, the projection M of the angular
momentum is no longer conserved. Then ¯M (T = 0, ω) is
no longer a step function and ∆can(ω, T = 0) decreases in
a gradual manner. The increase of ∆can(ω, T ) with T is
found to be weak. Hence, temperature-induced pairing is
expected in nuclei that build up large angular-momentum
by aligning the individual angular-momenta of the nu-
cleons near the Fermi surface. These are either spherical
nuclei (see Figs. 1,2) or the high-K isomers (see e.g. [13]).

In summary, at very low temperature an increasing
external magnetic ﬁeld causes the magnetic moment of
small superconducting clusters (R < 5 nm) to grow in
a step-wise manner. Each step reduces the pair corre-
lations until they are destroyed. However, with increas-
ing temperature the steps are washed out and substan-
tial pair correlations re-appear for high ﬁeld strengths,
where they are quenched at T = 0. Nuclei that built up
angular momentum along a symmetry axis behave in an
analogous manner. The pair correlations are destroyed
in a step-wise manner by subsequent alignment of the an-
gular momenta of individual nucleonic orbitals with the
symmetry axis. These steps are washed out with increas-
ing temperature and pair correlations appear at values
of the rotational frequency, where they are quenched at
T = 0. This phenomenon of temperature-induced pair-
ing reﬂects the strong ﬂuctuations of the order parameter
in very small systems with a ﬁxed particle number.

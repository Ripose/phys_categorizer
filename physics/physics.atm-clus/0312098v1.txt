Abstract

Low-temperature (< 60K) phase changes of free clusters containing 50, 137, and 229
CH4 molecules have been observed in isoenergetic Molecular Dynamics computations. Bulk
solid methane exhibits structural phase transformation at 20.4 K. However, clusters of 50
molecules already melt at ∼ 25 K, which makes the observation of solid-solid transformations
rather challenging.

1 Introduction

Small free clusters of molecules with very high symmetry (octahedral) have been found to resemble
bulk of the same substance even in the case of small number of ingredients (30 to 80) [1]. The
number of particles (molecules or/and atoms) that mimics bulk properties like phase transitions
is strongly dependent on the range of the potential. The eﬀect of decreasing the range of the
potential is to destabilize strained structures [2]. In the case of long-range potentials (Coulomb
[1]) one detects structures, determined by the co-operative (collective) interaction - the system
is expected to transform easier than in the case of short-range interactions. On the other side,
the surface of free clusters plays much more important role for long-range potentials. Various
parameters of the potential, for instance electric charge value, govern the cluster response to
external changes. An example is the melting temperature increase for higher charge values [3].

In the present work we study clusters consisting of less symmetrical molecules (tetrahedral) in
order to check how the lower symmetry of the ingredients inﬂuences cluster’s behavior at diﬀerent
temperatures. The interacting potential contains a long-range term (Coulomb), which makes
it necessary to study the size inﬂuence - clusters of 50, 137, 229 methane molecules have been
simulated with the help of the isoenergetic Molecular Dynamics method described in the next
section. Simulations of methane clusters have been performed more than two decades ago [4].
They showed that the lower limit of the classic approach is ∼10K. In those days the computers
were less fast and the researchers tended to go for cheap rather than reliable potentials. Nowadays

more sophisticated potentials are available and better results could be obtained [5]. This
justiﬁes re-visiting the problem of how the cluster size inﬂuences the structural phase changes.
Another intriguing question is how a free cluster, e.g. a cluster at zero external pressure, behaves
when the temperature is rather close to the ultimate low limit of the classic mechanics calculations.

Solid (bulk) methane exhibits several crystalline phases based mainly on the diﬀerence in the
orientation of molecules in the unit cell. Infrared investigation of solid methane performed by Bini
and co-workers [6] let him propose a phase diagram, which has been additionally elucidate by
Nakahata et al. with a help of optical and X-ray diﬀraction studies [7]. The liquid methane freezes
at 90.6 K and p = 0.1 MPa [8] into a fcc orientational disordered phase I [9], characterized with
rotational diﬀusion of the molecules. A transition to the orientational ordered phase II occurs at
20.4 K [10] at zero pressure. The phase II is the James-Keenan cubic structure, in which one out
of four molecules (Oh) is undergoing a weakly hindered rotation, while the other three molecules
(D2d) have an anti-ferro order [11].

The state of orientational disorder takes place for the systems of spherically- symmetric
molecules (CH4) with a symmetry lower than the site in the crystal structure [9]. At cooling such
systems could undergo phase transitions to a partially-ordered or fully ordered state. Hindered
rotations occur because of weakly angular-dependent intermolecular forces and a large rotational
energy as it is in methane [11].

Is such a behavior inherent for small systems as well? This is the question we study in the

current work.

2 The model

Due to their spherical symmetry methane molecules resemble in many aspects the noble gases (Ar,
Kr, Xe). The intra-molecular frequencies (∼ 4 × 1013, ∼ 9 × 1013 Hz) are one order of magnitude
higher than the frequency of the intermolecular vibrations. That is why, we consider the molecules
as rigid bodies (C-H distance b=1.094 ˚A). Suitable intermolecular potentials for regarding molec-
ular space orientations could be the Lenard-Jones potential [5] or a more sophisticated 3-body
RMK potential [12]. In both approaches complicated procedures had been followed to obtain pa-
rameters’ values. Needless to say, these parameters are not entirely satisfactory. In our study, the
total potential is a sum of pair atom-atom potentials Upw(i, j):

The parameters have been obtained in a way to ﬁt experimental data. For instance, the charge
and the bond-length are determined from the octopole moment value. σαβ in ˚A, ǫαβ in meV are

ǫCC = 4.257 , ǫHH = 0.715 , ǫCH = 1, 7447.
Two starting conﬁgurations with randomly oriented molecules have been designed: 1) a bcc lat-
tice, which resembles the most spherically-symmetric shape of a cluster and 2) fcc, which is a
possible lattice for a bulk methane. We execute the velocity Verlet algorithm [5, 13] for numerical
integration of classic equations of motion in a special micro-canonical ensemble - N, E, p=0 (free
clusters) at temperatures above 10K to avoid quantum eﬀects. The integration step of dt = 1f s
guarantees an accuracy greater than 0.003% of the energy conservation for runs up to ∼ 0.5ns;
the records are taken every 100 fs.

3 Results

Liquid- and solid-like phases can be distinguished with the help of a specially constructed formula,
which is an extension of the Lindemann index δlin [14]:

δlin =

N(N − 1)

N

Xi,j(i<j)=1
where ri,j is the distance between molecular centers of mass. In bulk, the Lindemann index is
computed on the basis of the mean deviation of the i-th atom from its ideal lattice position and
δlin < 0.1 indicates a solid state. In a free cluster the surface plays a destabilizing role and the
cluster is solid if δlin < 0.08 [15].

The Lindemann index, plotted in the Figs.(1 - 3), shows three distinguishable phases : two
solid-like phases below 30K and a liquid-like phase above 30K for all three sizes and both starting
conﬁgurations.
The caloric curves (total energy per particle as a function of temperature) are given in the Fig.5

and Fig.6. Although the caloric curves are too smooth (a change of the slope is hardly seen, no
more than 6%), we observe a region of frustration in the temperature interval (18,25) K. In our
computations the average temperature of the system is computed from its average kinetic energy:
< Ekin >= 3/2kBT , with kB - the Boltzmann constant. Analyzing the trajectories at diﬀerent
total energies, we see that the system temperature jumps unevenly in the above interval. This is
an indication for changes much more clearly seen with the help of the Lindemann index. There is
no hysteresis on ’heating-cooling’ of the system - Fig.4.

The diﬀerent phase structures are distinguished on the basis of their radial distribution func-
tions - Eq. 2: the radial distribution of molecular centers of mass shows the structure of the
cluster at a speciﬁc temperature, while the atom-atom radial distribution reveals orientational
order (disorder) of the molecules.

Fig.7 shows the existence of a solid-like structure below 30 K and the absence of that structure
above 30 K. The volume of the cluster enlarges at heating as well. Fig.8 shows typical distribution
of the atoms for the oriented (solid line in the ﬁgure) and disoriented (dashed line in the ﬁgure)
solid-like phases. The ﬁrst peak of the distribution correspond to the H-H neighbors, the second
peak corresponds to the C-H neighbors, and the third one is for the C-C neighbors. The same
maximum of the H-H and C-H peaks indicates a unique mutual orientation of the molecules, e.g
the cluster is orientationally ordered. The phase transition at ∼ 20K causes disorientation of the
molecules as it is seen in the Fig.8 - the dotted curve.

Finally, we present the Density of States (DOS) function obtained by a normal mode analysis
of the quenched system [16]. The Fig.9 shows evidently the existence of a rovibrational coupling

4 Conclusion

Implementing Molecular Dynamics method to a microcanonical state of free methane clusters,
we show that they exhibit transformations between an orientationally-ordered (at ∼ 10K) and
disordered phase (above 20K). The lack of hysteresis in the cooling-heating regime indicates a
continuous transition. However, such a statement can be conﬁrmed either by studying inﬁnite
systems (i.e. periodic boundary conditions) or by applying the ﬁnite-size scaling theory [17].

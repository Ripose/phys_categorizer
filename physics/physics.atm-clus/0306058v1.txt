Abstract

The surface plasmon in simple metal clusters is red-shifted from the Mie

frequency, the energy shift being signiﬁcantly larger than the usual spill-out

correction. Here we develop a variational approach to the RPA collective

excitations. Using a simple trial form, we obtain analytic expressions for the

energy shift beyond the spill-out contribution. We ﬁnd that the additional

red shift is proportional to the spill-out correction and can have the same

order of magnitude.

I. INTRODUCTION

Simple metal clusters exhibit a strong peak in their optical response that corresponds to a

collective oscillation of the valence electrons with respect to a neutralizing positively charged

background. Classically, the frequency of the oscillation is given by the Mie resonance

formula [1,2],

ω2

Mie =

4πne2
3m

1

(1)

where n is the density of a homogeneous electron gas. Quantum ﬁnite size eﬀects lead to

a red shift of this frequency as well as to a redistribution of the oscillator strength (f ) into

closely lying dipole states. Moments of the oscillator strength distribution Mk =

provide useful information. The ﬁrst moment M1, which measures the integral of the f -

distribution, equals the number of electrons (Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule). The mean

square frequency hω2i = M3/M1 is given by the overlap integral of the positive ionic charge

distribution and the exact ground state electronic density [2]. Within an ionic background

approximated by a jellium sphere, the mean square frequency is thus exactly related to the

square Mie frequency by

where ∆N/N is the fraction of electrons in the ground state that is outside the jellium sphere

radius. We called the corresponding energy shift ∆ωso (“spill-out”):

The actual red shifts are considerably larger than this. For sake of illustrating the dis-

cussion let us consider the sodium cluster Na+

21 for which detailed photoabsorption data is

available [3–7]. The Mie frequency is at 3.5 eV, taking the density corresponding to rs = 3.93

a.u., while the measured resonance is a peak 2.65 eV having width of about 0.3 eV (FWHM).

Thus there is a red shift of 24%, which may be compared with a 9% red shift predicted by

eq. (3) using jellium wave functions. To a large extent clusters with a “magic” number of

valence electrons behave optically as close shell spherical jellium spheres. The experimen-

tal photoabsorption spectra for these clusters are well described within the linear response

theory using either the time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) [8–10] or the

random phase approximation with exact exchange (RPAE) [11,12]. Red shifts of 14% and

18% are predicted by time-dependent density functional theory [13] and by the random

phase approximation [11,12], respectively. The oscillator strength distributions in the RPA

calculations are typically dominated by a few close states that exhaust almost all of the sum

2

rule. It is this concentration of strength, which we can identify as a dipole surface plasmon,

that will be of interest in this paper. It is worth of note that singling out a collective state is

not always possible even in small clusters. Whenever the collective state lies within a region

of high level density, there is a strong fragmentation into p-h states (Landau damping) and

several excited states may share evenly the strength. We will deal with this problem of the

deﬁnition of the collective state later by proposing a model in which there is no particle-hole

fragmentation.

Anharmonic eﬀects in metallic clusters were studied recently by Gerchikov, et al., [14]

making use of a coordinate transformation to separate center of mass (c.m.) and intrinsic

motion. The authors show that in absence of coupling between c.m. motion and intrinsic

excitations the surface plasmon associated with a jellium sphere has a single peak which is

red-shifted with respect to the Mie frequency by the spill-out electrons, Eq. (3). Turning

on the coupling yields a further red shift which indeed is larger in magnitude than the

spill-out contribution. Concomitantly, there is a partial transfer of strength into states of

higher energy preserving the sum rule, Eq. (2). The approach requires the spectrum of

excitations in the intrinsic coordinates, which were obtained by projection on the computed

wave functions of the numerical RPAE.

Another interesting approach to the coupling between the collective and noncollective

degrees of freedom was developed by Kurasawa, et al., [15], following the Tomonaga expan-

sion of the Hamiltonian. The collective coordinate is taken as the cm coordinate, as in ref.

[14], and the coeﬃcients of the harmonic terms in the Hamiltonian yield Eq. (2) for the

frequency. The authors derive expressions for the coupling terms in the Hamiltonian and

use them to estimate the variance of the Hamiltonian in the collective state. They ﬁnd

that the variance decreases with size of the cluster as 1/R, where R is the radius of the ion

distribution. Both the width of the Mie and its shift are obviously related to the variance

of H, but further assumptions are needed to make a quantitative connection.

In the present paper we wish to ﬁnd an analytic estimate of the red shift, keep as far

3

as possible the ordinary formulation of RPA, and not singling out a collective state in the

Hamiltonian. Our approach will be a variational RPA theory, which we present in the next

section. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section III we apply the formalism

to a system of interacting electrons. The model Hamiltonian describes interacting electrons

conﬁned in a pure harmonic potential, whereas the perturbation corrects for the jellium

conﬁnement. The model RPA solution is derived analytically and ﬁrst and second order

corrections of the frequency shift are given.

II. VARIATIONAL RPA

In this section, we establish our notation for the RPA theory of excitations and develop

a variational expression for perturbations to the collective excitation frequency. The per-

turbation behaves somewhat diﬀerently in RPA than in conventional matrix Hamiltonians

because the RPA operator is not Hermitean.

As usual, the starting point is a mean ﬁeld theory whose ground state is represented by

an orbital set φi satisfying the orbital equations

where ρ0 =

i |φi(r)|2. The RPA equations are obtained by considering small deviations

from the ground state,

P

h[ρ0]φi = ǫiφi

φi → φi + λ(xie−iωt + yieiωt).

Here xi, yi are vectors in whatever space (r-space,orbital occupation number,...) is used to

represent φi. The RPA equations can be expressed as

(4)

(5)

(6)

(h[ρ0] − ǫi)xi + δρ ∗

∗ φi = ωxi

−(h[ρ0] − ǫi)yi − δρ ∗

∗ φi = ωyi

δh
δρ

δh
δρ

4

where the transition density δρ is deﬁned by

and the symbol ∗ denotes an operator or matrix multiplication. Eq. (6) represents linear

eigenvalue problem for a nonhermitean operator R and the vector |zi = (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...).

We will write the equations compactly as

δρ =

φi(xi + yi)

i
X

R|zi = ω|zi.

For a nonhermitean operator, the adjoint vector hz| is deﬁned as the eigenvector of the

adjoint equation, hz|R = ωhz|. From the symmetry of R it is easy to see that it is given by

hz| = (x1, −y1, x2, −y2, ...)†.

We now ask how to construct a perturbation theory starting from the zero-order wave

function |z0i that is the solution of an unperturbed R0 with eigenfrequency ω0. If we had

the complete spectrum of R0, the perturbation series for R = R0 + ∆R could be written

down in the usual way,

|zi = |z0i +

|zαi

α
X

hzα|∆R|zi
ω0 − ωα

,

etc. This is in fact what is done in ref. [14]. However, this requires diagonalizing R0 which

in general can only be done numerically.

Instead we shall estimate the energy perturbation using a variational expression for the

frequency,

ω = min

w

hz0 + λw|R|z0 + λwi
hz0 + λw|z0 + λwi

,

where |wi is a vector to be speciﬁed later and λ is to be varied to minimize the expression.

Carrying out the variation and assuming that the perturbation is small, the value of λ at

the minimum is given by

and the energy shift is

λ ≈ −

hz0|R|wi − ω0hz0|wi
hw|Rwi − ω1hw|wi

5

(7)

(8)

ω ≈ ω0 + hz0|∆R|z0i −

(hz0|Rwi − ω1hz0|wi)2
hw|Rwi − ω1hw|wi

.

(9)

Here, ω1 ≡ hz0|R|z0i = ω0 + hz0|∆R|z0i.

The next question is how to choose the perturbation |wi. With ordinary Hamiltonians,

one can construct a two-state perturbation theory using the vector obtained by applying

∆R to the unperturbed vector, |wi = ∆R|z0i. However, we will see in the next section that

this fails completely for the RPA operator. Instead, we will ﬁnd that an approximation that

gives qualitatively acceptable results can be made by taking only the x-component of the

vector deﬁned by applying ∆R to |z0i.

III. COLLECTIVE LIMIT OF THE SURFACE PLASMON

We apply the RPA variational perturbation theory derived in the previous section to the

surface plasmon of small metal clusters. We write the single particle Hamiltonian as

where v ∗ ρ0 is the mean ﬁeld potential,

h = h0 + ∆V (r),
¯h2

∇2 +

h0 = −

mω2

0r2 + v ∗ ρ0,

v ∗ ρ0 =

v(r, r′)ρ0(r′) d3r′.

Z

Here v is the electron-electron interaction, which may contain an exchange-correlation con-

tribution from density functional theory. In this paper, we throughout use the jellium model

for the ionic background, and also assume that the ion and the electron densities are both

spherical. ω0 and ∆V (r) are then given by ω0 = Ze2/mR3 and

∆V (r) =

respectively, R being the sharp-cutoﬀ radius for the ion distribution.

The RPA equations can be solved exactly for the Mie resonance if h is replaced by h0.

associated with the eigenfrequency ω0. Notice that the eigenfrequency ω0 is the same as the

harmonic oscillation frequency in Eq. (11), agreeing with the Kohn’s theorem [16–20].

To prove that the collective solution (14) satisﬁes the RPA equation, we use the following

identity which results from the Hartree-Fock equation,

(h − ǫ)( ˆAφ) = [h, ˆA]φ.

Here ˆA is any one body operator. This yields

(h0 − ǫ)(zφ) = −

∂zφ,

1
m

(h0 − ǫ)(∂zφ) = −(mω2

0z + (v ∗ ∂zρ0))φ.

In the last step, we used the fact that the interaction v is translationally invariant. Notice

that the transition density is proportional to ∂zρ0 for the collective solution (14). The

second term in Eq. (17) is thus exactly canceled by the residual interaction term in the

RPA equations, proving that the collective ansatz (14) is indeed the eigenfunction of the

RPA matrix R0 with the eigenvalue ω0.

The familiar formula relating the red-shift to the electron spill-out probability can be

recovered from the expectation value of the original RPA matrix,

(z0|Rz0)
(z0|z0)

= ω0 + ∆ω.

However, the wave function z0 must be taken with the collective ansatz applied to the

Hamiltonian h. This is diﬀerent from the z0 deﬁned in Eq. (14), which was based on the

Hamiltonian h0. In the following, we have no further use for the original z0 and we will use

the same name here. Applying the RPA operator R to z0, we ﬁnd

R|z0i = ω0|z0i + |ui,

Eq. (21) is just the well-known spill-out formula, Eq.(3), to the ﬁrst order in ∆N/N.

IV. EVALUATION OF THE INTEGRALS

We now consider the frequency shift in the second order perturbation. Obvious pos-

sibilities for the perturbation are w0 ≡ (y, x) and u, but we ﬁnd that neither produces a

signiﬁcant energy shift. The problem with u is that the x component is tied to the y com-

ponent in Eq. (20). In fact, the energetics are such the y perturbation is much less than the

x perturbation. In order to avoid this undesirable feature, as we mentioned in Sec. II, we

simply take the x component of u for the perturbation. That is, we use

|˜ui ≡

V. NUMERICAL COMPARISON WITH THE RPA SOLUTIONS

To assess the reliability of the variational shifts, we have numerically solved the RPA

equations for the jellium model, using the computer program JellyRpa [13]. A typical

spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. This represents Na20 as a system of 20 electrons in a background

spherical charge distribution with a density corresponding to rs = 3.93 a.u. and total charge

Q = 20. The strength function includes an artiﬁcial width of Γ = 0.1 eV for display purposes.

The Mie frequency, Eq. (1), is indicated by ω0, while the prediction of the spill-out formula,

Eq.(3), is shown as ωso in the ﬁgure. One sees that the strength function is fragmented

into two large components that are considerably red-shifted from the Mie frequency, and

smaller contributions at higher frequencies. The corresponding spectrum with the jellium

background potential replaced by a pure harmonic potential is shown by the dashed line.

The numerical RPA frequency agrees very well with the Mie value in this case, showing that

10

the numerical algorithms used in JellyRpa are suﬃciently accurate for our purposes. The

red shift can be more easily displayed by a plot of the integrated strength function, shown

in the lower panel of the ﬁgure.

If we deﬁne the shift as the point where the integrated

strength reaches half of the maximum value, it corresponds to δω = 0.166 ωMie. On the

other hand, the collective formula for the red shift, Eq. (3), only gives δω = 0.058 ωMie,

when the integral for ∆N is evaluated with the ground state density.

The strength becomes increasingly fragmented in heavier clusters, making a precise def-

inition of the red shift problematic. We therefore have simpliﬁed the jellium model in our

numerical computations to see the eﬀects of the shift without the fragmentation of the

strength that occurs physically. To this end we put all the electrons in the lowest s-orbital,

treating them as bosons. Otherwise, the model is the same as the usual jellium model, with

the electron orbitals determined self-consistently in a background charge density of a uni-

form sphere. This model is easily implemented with JellyRpa by assigning the occupation

probabilities of the orbitals appropriately. Taking the density parameter as rs = 3.93 a.u.,

appropriate for sodium clusters, one ﬁnds that the ionization potential is rather close to

the value of the usual (fermionic) jellium model. For example, in the cluster with N = 20

atoms, the ionization potential ǫ has a value 2.84 eV for usual jellium model and the value

4.11 eV for our simpliﬁed s-wave treatment.

The results of the numerical calculation with the full eﬀect of the surface are shown in

Fig. 2 as the solid line. The collective spill-out correction from Eq. (3) is also shown as

the dotted line. One sees that the additional shift due to the wave function perturbation

is comparable to the spill-out correction, and has a similar N-dependence. The shift given

by the variational formula Eq. (9) is shown by the dashed line. The functional dependence

predicted by the formula is conﬁrmed by the numerical calculations, but the coeﬃcient of

N is too small by a factor of two or so.

11

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have developed a variational approach to treat perturbations to the collective RPA

wave functions, and have applied it to the surface plasmon in small metal clusters. Our

zeroth order solution is the same as that used by Gerchikov et al. [14] and Kurasawa et

al. [15]. It corresponds to the center of mass motion, and is the exact RPA solution when

the ionic background potential is a harmonic oscillator. The deviation of the background

potential from the harmonic shape is responsible for the perturbation. The ﬁrst order

perturbation yields the well-known spill-out formula for the plasmon frequency, as was also

shown in Refs. [14,15]. The higher order corrections lead to the additional energy shift

of the frequency [14], the anharmonicity of the spectrum [14], and the fragmentation of

the strength [15]. Those eﬀects were studied in Refs. [14,15] by considering explicitly the

couplings between the center of mass and the intrinsic motions. In this paper, we assumed

some analytic form for the perturbation and determined its coeﬃcient variationally. We

found that this approach qualitatively accounts for the red shift of the collective frequency,

but its magnitude came out too small by about a factor of two.

In order to have a more quantitative result, one would have to improve the variational

wave function. An obvious way is to introduce more than one term. Our method may

be viewed as the ﬁrst iteration of any iterative method for RPA [21–23]. One may need

more than one iteration to get a convergence and thus a suﬃciently large energy shift.

Another possible way is to construct the perturbed wave function based on the local RPA.

The authors of Ref. [24] expanded the collective operator with local functions and solved

a secular equation to determine the frequency. They showed that the expansion of the

collective operator with three functions, r cos θ, r3 cos θ, and r5 cos θ, gives a satisfactory

result for the collective frequency.

The method developed in this paper is general, and is not restricted to the surface

plasmon in micro clusters. One interesting application may be to the giant dipole resonance

in atomic nuclei. In heavy nuclei, the mass dependence of the isovector dipole frequency

12

deviates from the prediction of the Goldhaber-Teller model, that is based on a simple c.m.

motion [25,26]. The shift of collective frequency can be attributed to the eﬀect of deviation

of the mean-ﬁeld potential from the harmonic oscillator, and a similar treatment as the

present one is possible.

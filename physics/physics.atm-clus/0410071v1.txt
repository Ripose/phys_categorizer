e+ + H direct annihilation above the positronium formation threshold

(Dated: December 2, 2013)

A long-standing problem with the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation has been its inability to account for
the electron-positron annihilation in positron hydrogen scattering above the positronium formation threshold.
This letter shows that this problem has been resolved by the use of the modiﬁed Faddeev equations. A number
of e−e+ annihilation cross sections in the energy gap between P s(1s) and H(n = 2) thresholds are reported
for both the positron plus hydrogen incoming channel as well as the proton plus positronium incoming channel.
However the indirect annihilation cross sections after formation of the positronium themselves are well known,
they will not be included in this report.

PACS numbers: 36.10.Dr, 34.90.+q

When the possibility of e+e− annihilation in ﬂight is ne-
glected the e+ + H collision in the energy region between
P s(1s) and H(n = 2) thresholds can have only two open
channels. They are: the elastic channel and the rearrangement
channel, where the e+ capture the electron from H and form
a positronium in P s(1s). Under this assumption annihilation
can occur only after the formation of the positronium. The
lifetime of the P s(1s) is known to depend on the total spin
S. The singlet para-P s, 1S0, decays into 2γ rays with a life-
time τ ≈ 0.13ns. The triplet ortho-P s, 3S1, decay into 3γ
rays with τ ≈ 140ns [1]. These well known annihilation will
not be included in this report. We calculate the e+e− direct
annihilation using the standard relation [2]

σan = πr2

0(c/v)Zeff,

(1)

r0 = e2/mec2, Zeff is the annihilation coefﬁcient deﬁned by

Zeff = hΨ|δ(~r)Ψi,
~r is the distance between e+e− in the three-body wave func-
tion Ψ. The calculation of e+e− in ﬂight thus compensate for
the shortcoming of the quantum three-body calculation where
the annihilation channel is closed.

(2)

The modiﬁed Faddeev equation [3, 4] explicitly separates
the three-body wave function into the direct channel and the
rearrangement channel

Ψ = Ψ1(~x1, ~y1) + Ψ2(~x2, ~y2).

The components ψαlλ(xα, yα) in (8) are further expanded in

In the Ore gap, the f ’s are the product of the standard spher-
ical Bessel functions and the radial part of the bound-state
hydrogenic wave functions. ˜Kσ′σ differs from the standard
K-matrix elements Kσ′σ by only a kinematic factor.

According to Fig. 1 and Eq. (2) annihilation takes place
when ~x2 = 0. However, it is clear that the integrals in (2)
diverge whenever ψ2(~x2, ~y2) is involved. Thus, all previous
calculations of Zeff using (2) were limited to energies below

the positronium formation threshold. Only recently, Ref. [6]
used an imaginary absorption potential to replace the dynam-
ics of e−e+ annihilation. In solving the Schr¨odinger equation
they found the annihilation cross section below the P s(1s)
threshold joins smoothly to the positronium formation cross
section just above the threshold. But this imaginary potential
is too week to represent the annihilation dynamics above and
away from the P s(1s) threshold. According to this model,
above the P s(1s) threshold only indirect annihilation after
formation is possible. Ref. [7] renormalized the singularity in
(2) near the P s(1s) threshold using the physical 2γ-lifetime
of P s(1s). They also showed the smooth transition of the
annihilation cross section across P s(1s) threshold. Theirs is
essentially a threshold law, valid only near the threshold. Nev-
ertheless, we will show that the integral

Zinf = hψ1|δ(~r2|ψ1i

,

is well deﬁned and exists even above the P s(1s) threshold. In
principle, the divergent part of (2) must be renormalized to the
physical indirect annihilation cross section after the positron-
ium is formed. This part is related to the positronium for-
mation cross sections that we have already reported in [4, 8].
This report is devoted to the calculation of (10). To avoid
confusion, we deﬁne (10) to be the annihilation coefﬁcient
of e−e+ annihilation in ﬂight. Thus (10) truly represents the

and

missing open channel, the neglected dynamics in the quantum
mechanical solution (8) of the e+ + H system or other e++
atom systems.

where δ is the phase shift of the scattering problem as a result

When the incoming channel is e+ + H, ψ2 is solely respon-
sible for all positronium formation cross section. When p+P s
is the incoming channel, ψ1 is responsible for all the hydrogen
formation cross section . In either case, annihilation in ﬂight
calculated using (10) exists. Thus Z1inf and Z2inf are calcu-
lated for these two cases respectively. In Table I we present
the L = 0 contribution to (11) for a number of k values in the
Ore gap. Table II gives the corresponding annihilation cross
−1
sections. The point k = 0.71a
is just above the positronium
0
formation threshold, where the point k = 0.8612a
is near a
Feshbach resonance. Even though the S-state annihilation is
relatively smooth in the Ore gap, the sudden increase near a
Feshbach resonance is quite noticeable.

Table III for the case k = 0.71, the P s(1s) formation thresh-
old is located at k = 0.70653. In contrast, the scattering cross
sections were well converged at a cut-off radii of less then
100a0 [4, 8], which were cross-checked by another method
that solves the Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations by us-
ing the Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion approach [9]
and by numerous previous calculations using the Schr¨odinger
equation.

Calculations with considerable large cut-off radii require
substantial computer resources, even for relatively low en-
ergies such as that used in the present calculations where
all energies are inside the Ore gap between H(n = 2) and
P s(n = 1) thresholds. The three-body wave functions were
obtained by using a quintic spline collocation procedure on the
Jacobi coordinates [4, 5]. The dimension of the converged cal-
culations have reached 175000. Calculations at much higher
energies and near Feshbach resonances are quite demanding
in terms of computer resources. Yet such calculations are im-
portant, for example in the creating of the antihydrogen and
the studying of its spectroscopy. In the formation of antihy-
drogen using the process ¯p + P s → ¯H + e−, e−e+ annihila-
tion in the outgoing channel can be an important consideration
when excited states are involved, where numerous Feshbach
resonance exist.

Beyond the likely practical applications in antihydrogen re-
search, this calculation represents the ﬁrst breakthrough of a
long-standing problem in positron-atom quantum scattering,
i.e. its inability to account for the e−e+ annihilation above the
positronium formation threshold. Using Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, the calculations in [6] are valid only in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the positronium formation threshold at k =
−1
0 . The modiﬁed Faddeev equations enable the ex-
0.70653a
plicit separation of the e+ + H and the p + P s channels. The
annihilation cross sections in the e+ + H channel are well de-
ﬁned by (10). The singularity involving the p + P s channels
are renormalized to the indirect annihilation which can be cal-
culated using the known physical annihilation cross sections
of the positronium themselves and the respective positronium
formation cross sections obtained in the solution of (8). Thus

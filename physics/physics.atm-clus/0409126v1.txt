The ionization dynamics of a Xenon cluster with 40 atoms is analyzed under a pump probe
scenario of laser pulses where an infrared laser pulse of 50 fs length follows with a well deﬁned
time delay a VUV pulse of the same length and peak intensity. The mechanism of resonant energy
absorption due to the coincidence of the IR laser frequency with the frequency of collective motion
of quasi free electrons in the cluster is mapped out by varying the time delay between the pulses.

In recent years, much work has been devoted to the
ionization mechanisms of clusters in few-cycle, intense
laser ﬁelds (i.e. pulse lengths of the order of 100 fs and
intensities I = 1013 . . . 1016W/cm2):
from the case of
plasmon excitation when exposing metal clusters to rel-
atively weak ﬁelds [1] over enhanced ionization akin of
molecular ionization for small rare gas clusters in intense
ﬁelds [3] to collective excitation of a plasma resonance in
clusters of intermediate [4] to large sizes [5], ultimately
leading to ionic charge states of 40+ and higher [6], thus
potentially providing a new source for the generation of
x-rays, energetic ions or electrons and, via nuclear fusion,
even neutrons [7]. A new parameter regime for laser-
cluster interaction has been proven to become accesible
with the ﬁrst experiment using VUV-FEL light of 98nm
wavelength for the ionization of rare gas clusters [8], soon
followed by the ﬁrst proposals for an explanation of the
unexpectedly high charge states seen in this experiment
[9, 10].

While XUV-cluster interaction is still the subject of
an ongoing debate, there seems to be a more or less
common understanding regarding the qualitative picture
of IR laser-cluster interaction: during the rising part of
the laser pulse, a few electrons are ionized [16] leaving
the cluster with a net positive charge which leads to an
expansion typically on the same time scale as the du-
ration of the laser pulse. Hence, eﬀects which depend
on the internuclear distances can be resolved by varying
the pulse length [11] and/or applying pump-probe tech-
niques [12, 13]. The resolution of an optimum time delay

Since ∆t
tc, the critical expansion time of the cluster
at which maximum absorption of energy from the clus-
ter pulse is possible, long times tc are desirable which
implies large clusters consisting of heavy atoms (slower
Coulomb explosion). Also, the large number of quasi-
free electrons temporarily trapped in the cluster, lead to
a good contrast for the optimized versus non-optimized
signal [13].

The critical time tc originates from a critical radius
Rc = R(tc) of the cluster, usually larger than the equi-
librium radius R0, where energy absorption is most eﬃ-
cient. For larger clusters (resonant mechanism) this ra-
dius is determined by the surface plasma frequency ap-
proximately given by

where Nt is the number of atoms/ions in the cluster, Zt
is their average charge, Rt is the cluster radius and ωpl
the bulk plasma frequency. The indices t indicate a slow
dependence on time (at this point we want to emphasize
that, at least as long as the cluster is neutral, the surface
plasma resonance is mathematically completely equiva-
lent to the surface plasmon resonance and can be derived
along the same pathway. Nevertheless, we prefer to call
it a plasma resonance since there is in principle a physical
diﬀerence between a metal cluster being excited pertur-
batively and a rare gas cluster turned into a nanoplasma
by a nonperturbative laser ﬁeld).
ω, the laser
frequency, then the cloud of electrons which are trapped
inside the cluster behaves like a (damped) harmonic os-
cillator driven to resonance [4], leading to eﬃcient energy
absorption and ionization.

If Ωt

≈

The most important prerequisite for this mechanism
is a signiﬁcant amount of trapped (quasi-free) electrons
before Rc is reached, which can be achieved in two ways:
either the laser ﬁeld strength is small enough to leave
enough electrons inside the cluster before R = Rc; this
possibility is limited, however, by the fact that the inner
ionization process will eventually not start if the ﬁeld
strength is too small, so that no quasi-free electrons will
be created in the ﬁrst place. For metal clusters, this
problem does obviously not occur; on the other hand, one
has to ionize the cluster to a certain degree in order to
start the expansion process, and the range of intensities
and pulse lengths which can start the Coulomb explosion
while at the same time keeping the valence electron cloud
intact is quite small [14]. On the other hand, the force

that keeps the electrons inside the cluster is generated
by the space charge of the ions. Hence, going to larger
clusters while leaving the average ion charge constant,
will make it more and more diﬃcult for electrons to leave
the cluster, so that the number of trapped electrons will
increase with the cluster size. This is the reason why the
resonance absorption is much clearer seen with IR pulses
for large clusters (compare [12] with [13]).

To summarize, resonant absorption in intense IR
ﬁelds occurs (i) for metal clusters in weak ﬁelds (I <
1013W/cm2); the size of the clusters then only plays a
∼
role in so far as it will change the expansion speed, which
has to be accounted for by changing the pulse lengths
102 and inten-
accordingly; or (ii) for clusters with N >
1014W/cm2, where a substantial fraction of
sities of I <
∼
∼
the quasi-free electrons which are created by the laser is
kept inside the cluster, so that a collective oscillation can
develop.

In the case of small rare gas clusters in strong IR ﬁelds,
none of the above scenarions applies. Rather, ionization
is dominated by charge enhanced ionization, known al-
ready from diatomic molecules, where the shape of the
interatomic barrier leads to an optimal distance between
the cluster nuclei which results in an eﬃcient interplay
between inner and outer ionization [2]: the neighbour-
ing charges must be close enough to start an ioniza-
tion avalanche [3] once the ﬁrst electrons are created;
on the other hand, they must not be too close in or-
der to decrease the space charge which prevents the elec-
trons from escaping the cluster. Obviously, the whole
process relies on the ionization of the ﬁrst electrons rel-
atively early in the pulse; once the ﬁeld strength drops
signiﬁcantly below the ﬁeld strength Fth required to ﬁeld-
ionize a single cluster atom (Fth = E2
b /4, where Eb is
the ﬁrst atomic ionization energy), the avalanche will
not be started and the cluster will survive the radia-
tion relatively undamaged. For Xe clusters, for example,
Fth = 0.0493 a.u., which corresponds to an intensity of
Ith = 8.53

1013W/cm2.

As has been shown in the Hamburg experiment, the
threshold for an ionization avalanche is considerably
lower when using VUV instead of IR light. With intensi-
ties of the order of 1012 W/cm2 and a photon energy of
12.7 eV, complete breakup of Xe clusters and unexpect-
edly high ionic charges have been observed [8]. These
ﬁndings can be explained [10] by using standard atomic
photoabsorption rates but taking into account the eﬀec-
tive (inner) ionization threshold which is lowered by the
surrounding charges in a cluster (see Fig 1). Due to this
mechanism and due to the fact that the quiver amplitude
is two orders of magnitude smaller than for IR radiation,
a VUV pulse is much more eﬃcient in creating quasi-free
electrons than an IR pulse of the same peak intensity.

·

This opens up an elegant way to study the dynamics
of collectively excited electrons and hence the resonance
absorption mechanism in a small cluster by combining a
VUV pump pulse with a time delayed IR probe pulse:
The VUV pulse generates a large number of quasi-free

electrons. At same time the cluster gets only moderately
charged and a slow expansion sets in mainly driven by
the hydrodynamic pressure of the quasi-free electrons.
Hence, one can observe with a time delayed probe pulse
very cleanly the optimum condition for energy absorption
by the quasi-free electrons as a function of cluster size
starting at a size as small as N = 40 as we will demon-
strate with the following pump-probe scenario: a Xe40

intensity, but now with a wavelength of 780 nm. The
simulation has been done using the quasiclassical model
introduced in [3].

with the two pulses is shown in Fig. 2 for various times
delay ∆t. Two features stand out: ﬁrst of all, ions with
charges of 5+ or 6+ are produced already with these
comparatively low intensities. In fact, the ionization eﬃ-
ciency is comparable to the results from our calculation in
[10], where only a single VUV pulse was applied, but with
an intensity one order of magnitude higher than in the
present case (note that, with an average charge per atom
of 2.5 for ∆t=3500 a.u., the space charge of the Xe40
cluster from the present work is approximately equal to
the space charge of the Xe80 cluster from [10], where an
average charge per atom of only 1.5 was achieved, so that
the two cases can really be compared). This shows that
by combining VUV and IR pulses, signiﬁcantly higher
charge states can be achieved than by applying an IR or
a VUV pulse alone. Second, we see that the ionization is
most eﬃcient for a time delay of ∆t=3500 a.u.

≈

The absorbed energy and the average charge state per
atom after the cluster has disintegrated are shown in
Fig. 3 as a function of the time delay ∆t. The curve for
the energy absorption as well as the one for the charge
shows a maximum ∆t
3500 a.u. between the pump
VUV and the probe IR pulse. If our physical picture is
correct, this maximum should be due to the existence of
a collective resonance with frequency Ωt of the quasi-free
electrons that were created by the VUV pulse. This res-
onance is most eﬃciently excited by the IR pulse when
the laser frequency ω = Ωt. We will now proceed to give
evidence for this hypothesis.
In principle there are two ways to check numerically
whether the electron cloud is at resonance with the laser
ﬁeld: ﬁrst, treating the electrons and ions of the cluster
as a homogenic positively and negatively charged sphere,
respectively, one ends up with the resonance condition
Ωt = ω. However, the deﬁnition Eq. (1) of Ωt is by no

means unique, since one has to deﬁne a cluster “volume”
which itself is time dependent (through the increase of
the cluster radius) and so are the charge of the ions and
the number of electrons. The resonance condition can be
determined more reliably by calculating the phase diﬀer-
ence between the oscillation of the electronic center of
mass (ECM) and the driving laser ﬁeld F (t) = Ft cos ωt
[4]: if one assumes a collective oscillation with a damping
constant γ, the time-dependent dipole amplitude for the
ECM reads

is at its maximum. Note, however, that the amplitude Xt
does not necessarily increase considerably at resonance
due to strong damping (see Eq. (3)). Hence, we take
the condition φt = π/2 as the deﬁnition for the plasmon
resonance and calculate φt from the phase lag between
the driving ﬁeld F (t) and the dipole oscillation dXt/dt
by extracting the maximum of the time correlation c(δt)
between the two signals, where

(note that δt
= ∆t!). We chose the limits of integration in
Eq. (6) to be 10 IR cycles before and after the maximum
of the probe laser; the radial evolution Rt of the cluster
is suﬃciently slow so that the phase lag only changes by
a small amount during that time. The outcome of this
calculation is shown in Fig. 4. Indeed the phase lag is
3800a.u.. This proves that the
equal to π/2 for ∆t
maxima in Fig. 3 are due to a resonance of the collective
electron oscillation with the driving laser ﬁeld.

≈

Hence, the VUV pump combined with a IR probe pulse
can map out the internal collective cluster dynamics very
clearly and may be the only possibility to resolve this dy-
namics for small clusters. The reason is simply that the
VUV pulse produces a large number of quasi-free elec-
trons which can participate in collective electron motion.
On the other hand the VUV pulse itself does not couple
to this collective motion. Hence, only the probe pulse
probes literally the collective electron dyamics. Using
two IR pulses for pump and probe make this distinction
diﬃcult: The pump pulse must be very short in order
not to “probe” itself the collective electron dynamics.
On the other hand, if it is very short it will not pro-
duce a signiﬁcant number of quasi-free electron which

could move collectively since they are produced most ef-
ﬁciently through resonant coupling.
In the next phase
of the VUV-FEL at Hamburg, a pump-probe facility as
“used” in this theoretical investigation will be available
for experiments. Furthermore a similar experiment, but
much simpler than the one at DESY as far as the ex-
perimental set is concerned, is planned in Saclay [15]; it
is planned to use an 800 nm femtosecond laser, together
with its 9th harmonic (delivering photons with E
14
eV) as the IR and VUV pulse, respectively; the intensi-
ties will be a bit lower than the ones considered here, but
this should only result in a quantitative diﬀerence. The
present paper shows that indeed, interesting and unique
experiments can be done with such a time-delayed com-
bination of pulses.

[16] For rare gas clusters, the concepts of inner and outer ion-
ization, the ﬁrst being the ionization of an electron out of
an atomic orbital into the cluster environment, the latter
the process of an electron leaving the cluster as a whole,
have proven to be very useful. If one is dealing with the
valence electrons of a metal cluster, the inner ionization
step is skipped, since these electrons can already move
freely throughout the cluster. From the second shell on-
wards, metal clusters should not behave diﬀerent from

We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the structure and energetics of silver doped helium
clusters AgHen for n up to 100. Our simulations show the ﬁrst solvation shell of the Ag atom to be
composed by roughly 20 He atoms, and to possess a structured angular distribution. Moreover, the
electronic 2P1/2 ←2S1/2 and 2P3/2 ←2S1/2 electronic transitions of the embedded silver impurity
have been studied as a function of the number of helium atoms. The computed spectra show a
redshift for n ≤ 15 and an increasing blueshift for larger clusters, a feature attributed to the eﬀect
of the second solvation shell of He atoms. For the largest cluster, the computed excitation spectrum
is found in excellent agreement with the ones recorded in superﬂuid He clusters and bulk. No
signature of the direct formation of proposed AgHe2 exciplex is present in the computed spectra of
AgHe100.

PACS numbers:

Superﬂuid 4He clusters represent a gentle environment
where high resolution spectroscopic studies of atoms,
atomic clusters, and molecules at low temperature can
be carried out [1]. In such cold and ﬂuid quantum sys-
tems many perturbing eﬀects due to the temperature and
solid matrices are absent, allowing therefore for an eas-
ier interpretation of the experimentally recorded spec-
tra. Moreover, their superﬂuid behavior allows interest-
ing quantum eﬀects to take place and to be experimen-
tally probed (for instance see Refs. [2, 3]).

Whereas the coupling of the rotational and vibrational
motion of the molecules with the quantum motion of the
solvent is permitted by the similarity between energy lev-
els, the electronic structure of an atom is characterized
by energy diﬀerences orders of magnitude larger than the
ones needed to induce excitation in the atomic motion.
Although this diﬀerence might seem to work in the di-
rection of simplifying the physical description of the elec-
tronic transition processes, many important details still
wait to be clariﬁed. As an example, the ﬂuorescent D2
emission line (i.e. the 2S1/2 ←2P3/2 radiative transition)
of heavy single valence electron atoms dispersed in super-
ﬂuid helium is absent, while the D1 line is sharp and only
slightly shifted (1-2 nm) to the blue [4]. This is in con-
trast with the large broadening and strong blueshift of
the absorption lines. Moreover, some features of the LIF
spectra of the dispersed Ag were interpreted as signature
of the AgHe and AgHe2 exciplex formation [5].

The blueshift and broadening of the absorption lines

have been interpreted by means of a ”bubble model”.
Here, the dispersed atom is enclosed in a spherical cavity
due to the exchange repulsion of its valence electrons and
the He ones. The liquid He around an atom is modeled
by an isotropic sharp-edge density proﬁle with no atomic
internal structure. However, both the simple spherical
bubble model [6] and the one where quadrupolar distor-
tions of the spherical cavity are allowed [7] neither quan-
titatively predict the absorption spectrum of Cs and Rb,
nor allow to interpret the small splitting of the Rb D2
line. Reasonably, the lack of any shell structure in the
helium density proﬁle, the absence of a full atomistic de-
scription during the excitation process, and the physi-
cally incomplete description of the bubble distortion by
means of simple quadrupolar deformations may be held
responsible for this undesired outcome [8].

In order to gain a better understanding of the excita-
tion process and its dependency on the degree of ”solva-
tion” of the impurity, we feel a direct many-body simu-
lation of the excitation spectra to be mandatory. This
also allows to explore the change in the spectra upon the
increase of the number of He atoms in the clusters, and,
at the same time, to test the validity of our theoretical
approach.

With these goals in mind, we present a diﬀusion Monte
Carlo study of the 2P3/2 ←2 S1/2 and 2P1/2 ←2 S1/2
absorption spectra of silver doped helium clusters. The
Ag spectrum, both in bulk helium and in He clusters,
has been deeply studied and well characterized [5, 9, 10]
showing that Ag is indeed solvated. Moreover, accurate
interaction potentials between He and the excited 2S1/2,
2P1/2, and 2P3/2 states of Ag are available [11]. These
potentials allowed to assign the broad band at 382 nm in
the ﬂuorescence spectrum to the AgHe2 exciplex [5].

To tackle the atomic description needed to compute
the excitation spectra, we believe the Monte Carlo meth-

ods are the best suited techniques. Since these meth-
ods are well described in the literature [12], we sim-
ply state that while variational Monte Carlo (VMC) al-
lows one to optimize a trial wave function ΨT (R) and
to successively compute any expectation values hOiV MC
from it, diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC) corrects the re-
maining deﬁciencies of the variational description pro-
jecting out all the excited state components sampling

The resulting DMC energy values for the AgHen clus-

the diﬀerential quantity ∆(n) = −[E(n)−E(m)]/(n−m),
which can be interpreted as the evaporation energy of an

crease for n < 13 is followed by a rapid decrease in value
before plateauing for n ∼ 25. This behavior could be in-
terpreted invoking diﬀerent eﬀects. For n < 13, a newly
added helium feels the bare Ag interaction potential plus
the interaction with the already present He atoms, that
acts positively increasing the binding energy. Quantita-
tively, we found the changes of ∆(n) versus n similar to
the ones obtained for Hen [15], HenH− [16], and HenHF
[17]. Since this eﬀect seems to be independent of the
nature of the doping impurity, one may interpret it as
a dynamical many-body eﬀect of the interacting helium
atoms.

absorption wavelengths (nm) for AgHen clusters.

Beyond AgHe13, the value of ∆(n) decreases indicat-
ing the onset of a repulsive interaction. This could be
attributed to an ”excluded volume” eﬀect, where each
new He is strongly attracted by Ag in its ﬁrst coordina-
tion shell, but has to ”ﬁnd room” for itself forcing the
other atoms to increase their local density, and rising
their average kinetic energy.

Finally, for clusters larger than AgHe25, the evapo-
ration energy remains roughly constant around 3.1-3.5
cm−1 indicating that a new He atom feels a quite diﬀer-
ent environment than for n < 25.

with the AgHe12 one. As to AgHe30, the presence of a
broad shoulder at large r, that successively develops into
a well deﬁned peak, unambiguously indicates a second
shell. More interestingly, the height of the ﬁrst peak
continuously rises until the second shell is completely
ﬁlled, as indicated by the onset of another shoulder at
large Ag-He distance for AgHe100. Moreover, the density
minimum between the ﬁrst and second shell peaks also
increases in height on going towards larger clusters, be-
coming just 15% less than the second shell peak height.
Both these evidences can be interpreted as a direct signa-
ture of the ”non rigidity” of the ﬁrst He layer, as well as
of an easy exchange process between the ﬁrst and second

shell [18].

As to the angular distributions, Figure 2 shows sev-
eral cos(HeAgHe) distributions. The smaller clusters
(n ≤ 20) show a deep minimum for cos(HeAgHe) = 1
and a smooth maximum located in the 0.6-0.8 range,
both strong indications of a structured distribution of
the He atoms in the ﬁrst solvation shell. Here, the mini-
mum indicates that two He atoms cannot overlap or sur-
mount each other, the only two possible arrangements
having cos(HeAgHe) = 1. Whereas the overlap is for-
bidden by the repulsive part of the He-He potential, the
possibility of an He atom to surmount another is hindered
by the strength of the 2Σ AgHe potential that forces
the He motion in a limited radial region around Ag as
shown by the AgHe12 radial distribution.
Instead, the
smooth maximum indicates the relative localization ef-
fects due to the attractive interaction between He atoms.

This eﬀect is particularly evident for AgHe2, whose an-
gular distribution function decreases on going towards
cos(HeAgHe) = −1. The position of the maximum shifts
to larger cos(HeAgHe) values on going from n = 2 to
n = 20, suggesting a progressively more structured pack-
ing of the He atoms in the ﬁrst shell for n = 20, and
agreeing nicely with the aforementioned ”excluded vol-
ume” interpretation. The structured packing is also sup-
ported by the shallow second peak located around 0.1 in
the AgHe20 cosine distribution. Both the minimum and
the maximum are ”smeared out” by adding He atoms to
AgHe20, a clear indication that the second shell is less
structured and more ﬂuid than the ﬁrst one.

In this method, the spectral

Vexc(R) − Vgs(R) or, more accurately, of the quantity
Vexc(R) +
i<j VHeHe(rij ) − E0 over the sampled f (R)
[21]. Here, Vgs(R) (Vexc(R)) is the interaction poten-
tial between the ground (excited) state Ag atom with
the sourronding He atoms, while E0 is the DMC ground
state energy. The three Vexc(R) PES for a given clus-
ter conﬁguration are obtained from the AgHe 2Π1/2,
2Π3/2, and 2Σ interaction potentials using the Diatomic-
in-Molecules approach. The details are well described by
Nakayama and Yamashita for the Li, Na, and K cases
[22].

are blueshifted by less than 1 nm. The computed spec-
tra clearly show the two separated bands deriving from

the excitation of Ag into 2P1/2 and 2P3/2 states, the sec-
ond one also displaying the classical short wavelength
shoulder typical of the D2 line of heavy alkali atoms in
superﬂuid helium [6, 7]. For our largest cluster, the D1
and D2 lines have maxima located at 331.6 and 321.7
nm, and a FWHM of 4.3 and 9.8 nm, respectively. These
results are in accurate agreement with the experimental
wavelengths 332.8 and 322.5 nm, and FWHM 4.0 and 8.5
nm [10].

From the spectra shown in Fig. 3, it clearly appears
that the broadening of the absorption bands increases
on going towards larger clusters. This evidence indicates
that the Ag electronic degrees of freedom are coupled
with the motion of an increasing number of He atoms,
and not only with those located in the ﬁrst shell. More
interestingly, whereas all the clusters with n ≤ 15 show
a redshift with respect to the free Ag lines, the ones with
n ≥ 19 display a blueshift strongly dependent on the
number of He atoms. Here, the redshift for n ≤ 15 in-
dicates that the clusters possess an internal distribution
such that a vertical transition brings them in a region
of the excited state potential where the complexes can
form a bound state. This may give the possibility of
producing AgHen (n =1-15) exciplexes starting from the
corresponding clusters, and to experimentally study their
spectrum and decaying dynamics. Conversely, the larger
clusters are vertically excited to repulsive regions of the
potential energy surface (PES), therefore preventing the
direct formation of larger exciplexes.

The blueshift for n ≥ 19, at variance with basic solva-
tion concepts, indicates a large eﬀect of the second shell
ﬁlling on the absorption wavelengths. This is conﬁrmed
by the computational evidence that the excitation spec-
trum of AgHe100, that shows the onset of a third shell,
closely agrees with the one of AgHe90 (see Table I).

In order to rationalize this observation, as well as the
monotonic blueshift of the absorption bands upon in-
creasing of n, one must notice that the portion of the
AgHe pair distribution located in the 10-13 bohr range
overlaps with the tail of the repulsive excited AgHe 2Σ
potential. As a consequence, this zone of the pair density
introduces some positive contribution to the diagonal el-
ements of the matrix whose eigenvalues deﬁne the three
electronic excited PES of the complexes. Since the mag-
nitude of these contributions is dependent on the local He
V2Σ(r) over the He atoms falling
density via the sum
in that range, there is a net increase of the values of
the diagonal elements upon increasing of the size of the
cluster. This fact reﬂects itself in a positive shift of the
eigenvalues, and hence in the blueshift of the computed
spectra.

The freezing of metal nanoclusters such as gold, silver, and copper exhibits a novel structural
evolution. The formation of the icosahedral (Ih) structure is dominant despite its energetic metasta-
bility. This important phenomenon, hitherto not understood, is studied by calculating free energies
of gold nanoclusters. The structural transition barriers have been determined by using the umbrella
sampling technique combined with molecular dynamics simulations. Our calculations show that the
formation of Ih gold nanoclusters is attributed to the lower free energy barrier from the liquid to
the Ih phases compared to the barrier from the liquid to the face-centered-cubic crystal phases.

Recently, nanosized metal clusters have been exten-
sively studied as a fundamental element for technolog-
ical applications, such as nanocatalysts and nanoelec-
tronic devices [1]. Unlike bulk, at surfaces or inside of
metal nanoclusters, atomic bonds may be cut and new
bonds formed due to the presence of a nano-size sur-
face or quantum eﬀects. As a result, metal nanoclusters
exhibit unique chemical and physical properties distinct
from bulk materials. For the controlled growth of low
dimensional nanostructures, it is very important to un-
derstand the properties of metal nanoclusters, their for-
mation from the liquid state or gas phases, and their
chemistry.

In particular, phase transitions of metal nanoclusters
have attracted great interest because of novel physical be-
havior, such as size-dependent melting point depression
[2, 3], quasimelting [4, 5], and dynamic phase transitions
[6] in nano-size regions. For instance, small metal clusters
show lower melting point compared to the bulk melting
point [2, 3]. Furthermore, the structure of metal nan-
oclusters may ﬂuctuate below the melting point under
external perturbations [4, 5]. The experimental evidence
for the quasimelting of gold nanoclusters was reported
by Iijima and Ichihashi [4] through real-time microscopic
studies: The gold clusters change from a single crystalline
form to a twinned crystalline form based on icosahedral
(Ih) or decahedral (Dh) structures, and vice versa, when
irradiated with intense electron beams.

Another interesting aspect of phase transitions of nan-
oclusters is related to the novel structural evolution of
clusters produced from the liquid state or gas phase. Be-
cause of a large surface-to-volume ratio in nano-size re-
gions, metal clusters exhibit various structural modiﬁ-
cations. For example, for face-centered-cubic (fcc) noble
metals such as gold, silver, and copper, nanoclusters of Ih
or Dh structures with a ﬁvefold symmetry of noncrystal-
lographic atomic arrangements were dominantly formed

as observed in high resolution electron microscopy exper-
iments [7, 8, 9]. The experimental observations indicate
that the Ih or Dh structures should be a lower energy
state than an fcc structure, by thermodynamic principles,
in which the clusters are assumed to adopt the energeti-
cally stable thermal-equilibrium structure. In contrast to
the experimental observations, previous theoretical cal-
culations suggest that the minimum-energy structure for
Au is a truncated octahedron (TOh) rather than the Ih
or Dh structures for several hundred atom clusters and
the Ih structure is energetically metastable even for small
clusters (less than 100 atoms) with a large surface-to-
volume ratio [10, 11]. This novel and important phase
transition behavior during the freezing of metal nanoclus-
ters thus remains ambiguous.

In order to understand the freezing and melting behav-
ior of metal nanoclusters, we have performed free energy
calculations of gold nanoclusters using the umbrella sam-
pling technique [12, 13] combined with atomistic molec-
ular dynamics simulations. The variation of free ener-
gies for the structural transformation was obtained by
introducing a crystalline order parameter [14]. Our free
energy calculations showed that the formation of the Ih
structure is attributed to the lower free energy barrier
from the liquid to the Ih phases compared to the barrier
from the liquid to the fcc crystal phases. This explains
why the Ih cluster is frequently produced in experiments
despite its energetic metastability.

For the description of structural evolution of gold nan-
oclusters during the freezing and melting, we ﬁrst intro-
duce a structural order parameter Φ(rN ) that represents
the degree of crystallinity in the system [14, 15]. The
free energy F of the system with a particular value of
structural order parameter Φ at temperature T can be
calculated by:

F (Φ) = const − kBT ln P (Φ)

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and P (Φ)dΦ is the
probability to ﬁnd the system with values of Φ between
Φ and Φ + dΦ [13, 15].

In the above free energy calculations, conventional sim-
ulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
can be used in order to determine the probability P (Φ).
In this case, the probability P (Φ) is strongly peaked
around a particular value of Φ corresponding to a certain
equilibrium state at temperature T , while the probability
is very low for a high free energy state. So it is practi-
cally impossible to obtain the free energy as a function
of Φ only with the conventional MD simulations. This
problem, however, can be overcome by using the non-
Boltzmann sampling such as the umbrella sampling. In
the method, a Φ-dependent bias potential is used to make
the sampling probability appreciable in Φ region of high
free energy [13, 15, 16].

There are two factors that play a crucial role in the
above biased sampling method: The ﬁrst is a structural
order parameter Φ as a reaction coordinate that connects
the initial and ﬁnal states of the system, and the second
is a Φ-dependent bias potential that forces the system to
sample a high free energy region of Φ space along the
reaction path.

For the structural order parameter, we used the bond-
orientational parameter Q6, introduced by Steinhardt et
al [14]. This parameter, sensitive to the degree of ori-
entational correlation deﬁned by the vectors connecting
neighbor atoms, measures the degree of crystallinity of
the system. As shown in Table I, in a liquid cluster, Q6 is
very small (but nonzero due to the surface shape eﬀect),
while in a crystalline cluster, where the bond orientations
are correlated coherently throughout the whole region, it
is relatively large. We here note that Q6 is not a state
function with any speciﬁc internal structure but just a
reaction coordinate indicating the degree of crystallinity.

For the ﬁctitious bias potential of the umbrella sam-
pling, we chose a harmonic function localized around a
speciﬁc value of the order parameter Φ(= Q6). We bi-
ased the conﬁguration space sampling by adding this bias
potential to the original potential energy of our system.
By adjusting the center position of the harmonic function
to the region of a large free energy barrier [15, 17], we
could achieve relatively uniform sampling over the whole
region of the phase transition. As a result, the transi-
tion between cluster phases of low and high crystallinity
was made possible in spite of the appreciable free energy
barrier.

cluster.

We now investigate the behavior of melting and freez-
ing of Au nanoclusters by calculating the free energies of
the Au nanoclusters near the melting point.
In these
calculations, the probability P (Φ) for the free energy
was obtained by MD simulations based on the semi-
empirical embedded-atom method [18] and the bias po-
tential scheme. As an initial cluster conﬁguration, a TOh
cluster of 459 atoms was used. The free energy calcula-
tions were done at various temperatures between 760 and
820 K with an interval of 10 or 20 K by using the Ander-
son thermostat [19]. The space of bond-order parameter
Q6 was divided into 20 windows and umbrella sampling
runs were performed with a bias potential correspond-
ing to each window. Then the self-consistent histogram
method [13] was used to reconstruct the overall distribu-
tion of probability P (Q6) from the individual histogram
obtained in diﬀerent windows. The total simulation time
was more than 4 × 105∆t, where ∆t =2.5 fs represents
the time step for the integration of the equation of mo-
tion. To check the reversibility of the free energy curves,
we also calculated the free energies by varying the Q6
parameter in both increasing and decreasing directions.
The calculations showed no signiﬁcant hysteresis except
at low temperature where the free energy changes steeply
with Q6. This indicates that our simulation time is long
enough to equilibrate the system with negligible hystere-
sis. Typical results of the probability and free energy
calculations are shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b), respectively.
More details on the simulation procedures and numerical
techniques are described elsewhere [17, 20].

FIG. 2: Free energy curves for a 459-atom Au cluster as a
function of crystallinity (Q6) at various temperatures. The
free energy was obtained by using the statistical umbrella
sampling method combined with atomistic simulations. The
equilibrium phase transitions temperature is determined to
be around 780 K.

Figure 2 shows the free energy (∆F = F (Q6) − Fliquid)
curves of the gold nanoclusters as a function of a crys-
talline order parameter Q6. Here, the liquid state is taken
as a reference free energy state. The free energy curves
at various temperatures contain two or more energy min-
ima representing the liquid and crystalline structures. In
order to determine the cluster structures at the minimum
states, the typical atomic conﬁguration at each stage was
captured as shown in Fig. 3. The two energy minima at
Q6 = 0.45 and 0.05 represent the crystalline state of a
TOh fcc structure and the liquid state, respectively. In
addition, the phase transition temperature from the liq-
uid to the solid state occurs when the free energies of
solid and liquid are equal. The transition temperature
was around 780 K. At high temperatures such as 820 or
800 K above the transition temperature, the liquid state
is a global energy-minimum, while the fcc solid state is
metastable. Our free energy calculations show that the
initial fcc TOh cluster melts at 820 K with a very low
free energy barrier (less than a few kBT ). When temper-
ature is further reduced, the relative free energy of the
crystalline solid decreases monotonically and becomes a
global minimum state at T < 780 K.

Here, the free energy curves below the transition tem-
perature are particularly interesting because they are ex-
pected to provide physical insight into the freezing be-

havior of the Au nanoclusters. Inspection of the curves
gives two typical freezing paths, depending on the tem-
perature. At small undercooling temperature of 780 K,
the curve depicts a freezing path with a very large free
energy barrier of 10kBT and shows the absence of any
signiﬁcant metastable solid state of a local free-energy
minimum. However, at more undercooling temperature
(770 K), the free energy changes signiﬁcantly and a lo-
cal free-energy-minimum state starts to appear at around
Q6 ≈ 0.1. The typical atomic conﬁguration at this state
shows a ﬁvefold symmetry on its surface [see Fig. 3(c)].
Further investigation of this metastable structure reveals
that the cluster conﬁguration corresponds precisely to the
Ih structure only with some defects around the center of
the cluster. At this temperature, the TOh fcc structure
is thermodynamically the most stable. In addition, we
show that the free energy barrier for the transition from
liquid to the metastable Ih cluster is very low (≈ kBT ),
while the barrier from the liquid state to the fcc crystal
is as large as 7kBT . This free energy behavior is more
prominent with further decreasing of temperature (760
K) as shown in Fig. 2. Considering the fast cooling rate
of clusters in typical experimental conditions [21], this
simulation result clearly shows that the cluster can be
dynamically trapped into the metastable state of the Ih
structure with a very low free energy barrier during the
freezing. The very low free energy barrier for the for-
mation of the Ih structure explains why the Ih cluster
structure is dominantly formed in spite of its energetic
metastability [22].

In addition to the freezing behavior, the melting of

metal nanoclusters can be also explained by the free
energy curves of Fig. 2. Previous MD simulations re-
ported that gold nanoclusters initially possessing an fcc
single crystalline structure underwent a structural trans-
formation to an Ih structure before melting [23]. This
result suggests that below the melting temperature, the
Ih structure should be an intermediate stable state be-
tween an fcc single crystalline structure and the liquid
phase [23]. In contrast, our free energy curves in Fig. 2
show that the Ih structure is not stable along the melting
path near the melting temperature. It is noted that the
previous MD simulations were done under the constant
energy condition [23]. The latent heat eﬀect of melting
arising from the constant energy condition is expected to
aﬀect the structural transformation. Actually, the latent
energy lowers the temperature by more than 80 K for
this size of nanocluster. Such instantaneous refreezing of
the cluster leads to the formation of the Ih local energy-
minimum state before melting (see the free energy curve
at 760 K of Fig. 2). In order to conﬁrm this argument,
we compared MD simulations under constant energy and
thermostat conditions. In accordance with the previous
works, we obtained the formation of the Ih structure dur-
ing melting under the constant energy condition, but we
could not under the thermostat condition.

In our simulations, diﬀerent cluster sizes can aﬀect the
freezing and melting behavior of nanoclusters. For ex-
ample, we examined the cluster size eﬀect by using a
561-atom cluster. For this cluster, the formation of the
Ih structure is also dominant during freezing, in accor-
dance with previous works [24, 25]. Further calculations
of the free energies of the cluster clearly showed that the
low free energy barrier from the liquid to the Ih states
contributes to the dominant formation of the Ih structure
during freezing.

In summary, the melting and freezing behavior of gold
nanoclusters was revisited in terms of the free energy as
a function of a crystalline order parameter. By using
the umbrella sampling technique combined with molecu-
lar dynamics simulations, the free energy barrier for the
structural transition was calculated. It was found that
the dominant formation of the Ih structure during freez-
ing of Au nanoclusters is attributed to its low free energy
barrier. Our free energy approach allows atomistic cal-
culations for understanding dynamic properties that are
otherwise inaccessible, such as structural properties and
formation dynamics of nano-size clusters. It opens a way
to atomic simulations, capable of quantitatively studying
the controlled growth of low dimensional nanostructures.

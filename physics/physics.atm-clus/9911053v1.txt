Very low-energy scattering of orthopositronium by helium has been investigated for simultane-
ous study of elastic cross section and pick-oﬀ quenching rate using a model exchange potential.
The present calculational scheme, while agrees with the measured cross section of Skalsey et
al, reproduces successfully the parameter
eﬀ, the eﬀective number of electrons per atom in a
singlet state relative to the positron. Together with the fact that this model potential also leads
to an agreement with measured medium energy cross sections of this system, this study seems
to resolve the long-standing discrepancy at low energies among diﬀerent theoretical calculations
and experimental measurements.

Studies on positronium- (Ps-)impact scattering
have gained momentum these days due to the avail-
ability of ortho-Ps beam in the laboratory and its vast
applicational potential coupled with the present in-
adequate and inconclusive understanding of its inter-
action dynamics with matter [1]. Ps scattering by
neutral targets has posed a challenge to theoreticians
on a proper accounting of experimental data as most
existing theoretical works disagree with the major ex-
perimental trend.

The discrepancy ﬁgures out prominently in the Ps-
He system where there are many theoretical and ex-
perimental studies. The medium-energy experimental
cross section shows a declining trend with decreasing
energy [2] from a peak around 20 eV for Ps-He scat-
tering. Similar trend is also observed in Ps-H2 and Ps-
Ar systems [2,3]. This trend, which is supported by
the recent measurement of Skalsey et al [4], could not
be reproduced in most theoretical predictions [5–9].
At very low energies, these theories and experiments
[2–4,10,11] on the Ps-He system are inconsistent with
each other and also among themselves. For illustra-
tion, the zero-energy cross sections calculated on Ps-
He by diﬀerent authors vary from 3.3˚A2 [12] to 16.54
˚A2 [13] while the measured values range from 2.3
0.4
˚A2 (at 0.915 eV) [4] to 11
3 ˚A2 (between 0 to 0.3
eV) [10]. Pointing out the very reactive nature of Ps
scattering and its associated convergence diﬃculties,
a prescription for the generation of nonlocal model
exchange potential has been advocated recently and
applied successfully to diﬀerent electron-impact (tar-
gets: H, He) and Ps-impact (targets: H [15,16], He
[14], H2 [17], Ar, Ne [18]) scatterings problems using
static-exchange to three-Ps-state models. The three-
Ps-state calculation for Ps-He predict a further lower
zero-energy cross section of 2.42 ˚A2 [14].

In this work we shed light on the abovementioned
discrepancy in Ps-He system in conjunction with a
determination of the parameter 1Zeﬀ which denotes
the eﬀective number of electrons per atom in a singlet

state relative to the positron. The study of this pa-
rameter is supposed to provide a stringent test for the
model potential. The incident ortho Ps(1s) atom in
a triplet state with a lifetime of 142ns can decay into
three photons and is more stable than its para coun-
terpart in a singlet state with a lifetime of 0.125ns for
a two-photon decay mode. However, in its interaction
with matter, the positron of Ps can ﬁnd an atomic
electron in a spin-singlet state and the two can be
annihilated by a two-photon decay mode without re-
ally forming a para Ps atom by electron exchange.
This process is termed pick-oﬀ quenching. From the
experimental pick-oﬀ quenching rate the parameter
1Zeﬀ can be extracted. Theoretically 1Zeﬀ can be
calculated from the wave function of the Ps-He sys-
tem Ψ(rp, sp; r1, s1; r2, s2; r3, s3) where r and s refer
to position and spin, the suﬃx p refers to the positron
and i = 1, 2, 3 refer to the electrons. Following Barker
and Bransden [7,13], the amplitude for ﬁnding the
positron and one of the atomic electrons in a relative
singlet state is

Φ(rp; r1; r2,s2; r3, s3) =< χ0(sp, s1)

The factor 3 appears as each of the three electrons of
the Ps-He system contributes equally to 1Zeﬀ.

Unlike the scattering cross sections, which are de-
termined from the asymptotic part of the Ps-He wave
function, the parameter 1Zeﬀ is sensitive to the Ps-He
wave function at short distances and its correct eval-
uation in a theoretical calculation should provide a
sensitive test about its realistic nature. There is con-
siderable discrepancy between theory and experiment
in the value of the parameter 1Zeﬀ. The experimen-
tal measurements have yielded 1Zeﬀ = 0.108

0.068 [7,20], and 1Zeﬀ =
[13,19], 1Zeﬀ = 0.135
25% [7,21], whereas diﬀerent static-exchange
0.25
calculations have yielded values ranging from 0.02 to
0.1 [5,7,13]. Compared to other exchange potentials,
the present scheme leads to substantially weaker re-
pulsive exchange potential and it is expected that the
present scheme will lead to a larger value of 1Zeﬀ in
Ps-He system as is demanded by experiments [19–21].
In the static-exchange approximation the Ps-He
wave function is represented by the following an-
tisymmetrized product of the internal wave func-
tions of Ps(1s), φP s(r1

where x is the angle between p and q. Although the
model exchange potential (0.16) has been found to
be satisfactory for calculating scattering cross sections
[14], it is interesting to investigate if it is also eﬀective
in the calculation of ﬁner scattering observables, such
as the parameter 1Zeﬀ. A scheme for the calculation
of 1Zeﬀ for He wave functions of type (0.11) is given
by Fraser and Kraidy [13] and we employ the same in
the present calculation.

First we show our results for the low-energy elastic
and momentum-transfer cross sections in Fig. 1 to-
gether those obtained from other theories and experi-
ments. The triplet Ps-He scattering length in this case
is 0.87a0, compared to 1.39a0 obtained by Drachman
and Houston [5]. The discrepancy among various re-
sults is apparent in this plot. The three experimental

2

results for cross sections [4,10] shown by solid circles
vary from 2.3 ˚A2 [4], through 7.45 ˚A2 [11], to 11 ˚A2
[10] at 0.9 eV, 0 eV, and 0.15 eV, respectively. It is
diﬃcult to reconcile these three experimental results
in a theoretical model. Previous static-exchange cal-
culations [7–9,13] except those of Ref. [14] all tend
to support the largest cross section of Ref. [10]. The
model calculation of Drachman and Houston [5] de-
noted by a cross in Fig. 1 is consistent with the exper-
iment of Ref. [11]. This discrepancy has been partially
resolved in the study of Ref. [14], where it has been
demonstrated that the present model exchange poten-
tial is unique in being able to reproduce experimental
cross sections [2,3] upto medium energies (about 60
eV) fairly well. Other theoretical calculations are un-
able to reproduce [7,8,13] the experimental trend of
total cross section at diﬀerent energies with a mini-
mum around 5.1 eV. The present elastic (full line) and
momentum-transfer (dashed line) static-exchange cal-
culations are consistent with the experiment of Skalsey
et al [4].

Figure 1

of 0.07 to 0.31 for 1Zeﬀ. Of the three experiments the
one by Duﬀ and Heymann [19] with the smallest error
bar might be the most accurate.

The much too small values of 1Zeﬀ obtained in
previous calculations [7,13] seem to be a consequence
of a much stronger (exchange) repulsion in the elas-
tic channel of these models. This is reﬂected in the
zero-energy cross section or the scattering length of
these calculations. For a repulsive potential the low-
energy cross section increases with repulsion, conse-
quently, the previous calculations have led to unusu-
ally large triplet scattering lengths compared to the
present work. This is most clearly exhibited in a cor-
relation exhibited in Fig. 3 where we plot 1Zeﬀ versus
triplet scattering length of diﬀerent calculations. The
larger the scattering length the smaller is the 1Zeﬀ.
This correlation is similar to diﬀerent correlations ob-
served in the study of Ps-H scattering in Ref. [16].

Next we perform an S-wave calculation for the pa-
rameter 1Zeﬀ. In Fig. 2 we plot the results for the
present calculation of 1Zeﬀ at diﬀerent energies. For
comparison we also plot the results of previous calcu-
lation by Barker and Bransden [7] and by Fraser and
Kraidy [13] and the existing three experimental data.
Although Drachman and Houston [5] did not calcu-
late 1Zeﬀ at diﬀerent energies, their low-energy value
of 0.1 is in reasonable agreement with the present re-
sult of 0.11 and experiment of Refs. [19,20]. The three
experimental results with error bars cover the range

We next comment on two aspects of the present
calculation. First, we used a two-term helium wave
function. We also repeated our calculation with the
one-term helium wave function of Ref. [9] and the ﬁve-
term wave function used in Ref. [14]. The results for
both the cross section and 1Zeﬀ suﬀer insigniﬁcant
change with the change of wave function. For 1Zeﬀ,
the diﬀerent results are within the error bar of Ref.
[19]; for cross section they are also within the error
bar of Ref. [4]. Hence we do not believe the present
results to be so peculiar as to be of no general validity.
Secondly, we performed a L = 0 calculation for 1Zeﬀ.
At the experimental energies less than 0.03 eV, the
eﬀect of higher partial waves is practically zero (well
within the error bar of Ref. [19]); at 1 eV this eﬀect is

quite small.

From the consideration above, we believe the
present static-exchange calculation as well as the pre-
vious calculations [14] using the same exchange po-
tential provide a realistic account of very low-energy
Ps-He scattering. However, the precise agreement of
the static-exchange calculation with experiment is ex-
pected to be incidental. For a complete understanding
of this problem higher excited states of both Ps and
He should be incorporated in the model. The inclu-
sion of Ps excitation channels has been found [14] to
decrease the low-energy cross sections and we might
need to reﬁt the low-energy cross sections by chang-
ing the parameters α and/or β of the potential in Eq.
(0.14), as in Refs. [16,14].

In conclusion, we have used a recently suggested
nonlocal model exchange potential [15,16,14,17] and
applied it to the study of Ps-He scattering at low ener-
gies. We have critically examined the static-exchange
calculation to see if it can account for satisfactorily
[14] the measured cross sections of Refs. [2,4] and
the ‘measured’ value of the parameter 1Zeﬀ of Refs.
[19,20]. The present calculation is in reasonable agree-
ment with the calculation of Ref. [5]. However, it is
diﬃcult to reconcile the present calculation with the
experiment of Ref. [21]. In a previous study [14], the
present exchange potential has been found to repro-
duce the low- to medium-energy cross sections of Refs.
[2,4] well. This coupled with the present study seems
to indicate that the 1Zeﬀ measurement of Ref. [19]
and the high- and low-energy cross section measure-
ments of Refs. [2] and [4] are consistent among each
other as well as with the present calculation which
possibly provides a faithful description of low-energy
Ps-He scattering. We observe a correlation between
1Zeﬀ and triplet scattering length of various calcula-
tions (Fig. 3), which demonstrates that the smaller
the scattering length the larger is the value of 1Zeﬀ.
This correlation is similar to diﬀerent correlations ob-

4

served between the low-energy Ps-H observables re-
cently [16].

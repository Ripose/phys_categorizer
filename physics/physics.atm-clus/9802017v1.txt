Abstract

The time-dependent local-density approximation (TDLDA) is shown to re-

main accurate in describing the atomic response of group IB elements under

the additional approximation of using pseudopotentials to treat the eﬀects of

core electrons. This extends the work of Zangwill and Soven who showed the

utility of the all-electron TDLDA in the atomic response problem.

I. INTRODUCTION

Mean ﬁeld theory is now widely used in chemistry and condensed-matter physics, treat-

ing the electron-electron interaction in the local-density approximation [1]. An additional

approximation which is often made is in multi-atom calculations is to use pseudopotentials

for the ionic part of the Hamiltonian [2] to avoid explicit calculation of the core electrons.

The static theory is remarkably successful in describing binding and ground state proper-

ties. The dynamic theory based on these Hamiltonian approximations, the time-dependent

local-density approximation (TDLDA) is also quite tractable numerically and often gives an

excellent description of the strong transitions [3–9].

In simple systems such as atoms TDLDA computations are quite feasible without making

the pseudopotential approximation [10–13]. However for many-atom systems with three-

dimensional bases such as plane-wave or coordinate-space meshes, the use of pseudopoten-

tials is practically unavoidable. This is the general motivation of this study comparing the

pseudopotential approximation to the all-electron calculation of the atomic response. The

quality of the TDLDA approximation depends of course on the excitation energy and on the

detail one requires. At low energies, in the region of the discrete transitions, the TDLDA

provides overall account of the oscillator strength as function of excitation, but the details

of transition energies and strengths are given much more accurately by more sophisticated

techniques. At energies above the ionization threshold the experimental spectra do not have

so much detail and the TDLDA is arguably the most eﬀective approximation available. As

one goes up in energy the dynamic electron-electron interaction decreases in importance,

and the TDLDA becomes an unnecessary reﬁnement on the independent-electron Hartree-

Fock approximation. Of course about the thresholds for core excitation the pseudopotential

TDLDA invalid, since it doesn’t treat core degrees of freedom explicitly.

II. OSCILLATOR STRENGTHS IN IB ATOMS

The question of the validity of the pseudopotential approximation in the lower energy

domain arose in our studies when we tried to apply TDLDA to clusters made from group IB

elements, i.e. Cu, Ag, and Au. In these elements, the closed d shell just below the valence

s shell is important to the dynamics and cannot be treated in a frozen approximation.

However, we found when we calculated the TDLDA response of small Ag clusters including

the d-shell electrons that the f sum rule for the valance electrons was badly violated. Since

2

the f -sum rule counts the number of electrons, we expected the sum rule to equal the number

of valence electrons in the pseudopotential calculation. In fact, this is not the case because

the pseudopotential is nonlocal. The pseudopotentials necessarily depend on the angular

momentum l of the electron (with respect to the ion), and the double commutator that gives

the sum rule for a closed l-shell has a contribution from the potential given by

∆fl =

where φl(r) is the radial wave function of the electron and Vl(r) is the pseudopotential for

angular momentum l. In the IB atoms with explicit treatment of outer s- and d-electrons,

the ordinary sum rule arise from the kinetic energy operator gives f = 11, the number of

active electrons. The potential roughly doubles this, which may be seen from the numbers

in Table I. The second column gives the total oscillator strength with only the kinetic part

of the Hamiltonian, and the third column gives the result including the pseudopotential

contribution from eq. (1) as well. The qualitative eﬀect of a nonlocal pseudopotential on

oscillator strengths in clusters of the group-IA atom lithium has been recently discussed in

ref. [14]. Here the nonlocality induces an eﬀective mass to lower the oscillator strength of

the collective valence transition.

There are several possibilities to interpret the large oscillator strength in the pseudopo-

tential of IB atoms. The best outcome for theory would be if the pseudopotential TDLDA

were still accurate in the low-energy domain, and the extra f strength is physical and due

to indirect eﬀects of the core electrons. Another possibility is that the extra strength is an

artifact of the nonlocality of the pseudopotentials. In that case we ask further whether the

approximation introduces spurious strength in the spectroscopic domain or only in the higher

energy domain, where it would be less signiﬁcant to present applications of the TDLDA.

We shall study the atomic response of group IB elements following closely the method

of Zangwill and Soven [10]. The independent-electron response, given by

Π0(~r, ~r′, ω) =

i (~r)φi(~r′)φ∗
φ∗

j (~r′)φj(~r)

is represented on a radial coordinate space mesh with an angular momentum decomposi-

tion. The sum over particle states in eq.

(2) is replaced by the single-particle Green’s

function, greatly simplifying the treatment of the continuum1. The interacting response is

then computed by the matrix equation,

ΠT DLDA = Π0(1 − vΠ0)−1

(3)

where v is the electron-electron interaction. The interaction v includes the local density

approximation to the exchange and correlation energy given by the parameterization of

Ceperley and Alder [16]. The Hamiltonian and Green’s function is nonrelativistic except for

the Au calculation, where a relativistic treatment is necessary to get reasonable agreement

with spectroscopic properties. The construction of a relativistic Green’s function is discussed

in refs. [17,18].

Our pseudopotentials are calculated by the procedure of Troullier and Martins [19].

There is a single parameter in constructing the pseudopotential, the radius a at which the

potential joins the all-electron self-consistent potential, which is used for the outer regions.

In this study we have used values a = 1.1 ˚Afor s, d, and f orbitals in Cu and Ag, and

a = 1.21 ˚Afor the p orbitals. In Au, we took a = 1.24 ˚Afor all orbitals. As a consistency

check, we show in Table I the integrated TDLDA response calculated up to 400 eV. The

integrated response I(ω) is given by the following integral over Im Π,

I(ω) =

It may be seen from Table I that TDLDA conserves the sum rule and the integrated strength

agrees with the double commutator, as it must.

We now compare the pseudopotential response with the all-electron response in the

diﬀerent energy domains, ﬁrst examining the spectroscopic transitions. The strong s → p

excitation is calculated in various approximations with the results shown in Table II. In

1This technique was ﬁrst applied to calculate nuclear response functions [15].

the case of Au, the energies and transition strengths are the weighted averages for the

s1/2 → p1/2 and s1/2 → p3/2 excitations. The independent-particle LDA is computed from

the Π0 response and is shown in the ﬁrst column. The transition in the TDLDA, shown in

the next column, has nearly the same energy but a quenched strength due to screening by

the d-shell electrons. The screening eﬀect amounts to a 40-60% reduction of the transition

strengths. This illustrates the advantage of the TDLDA that it incorporates the screening

automatically, unlike some other treatments [20,21]. The pseudopotential approximation

gives very similar energies and transition strengths, as shown in the third column. For

completeness we also compare with experiment, although the well-known deﬁciencies of

the LDA make this an unreliable application. The empirical strengths show a screening

somewhere between the TDLDA prediction and the independent-particle value, with the

TDLDA giving a better account of the strength for Ag and Au.

We next turn to the continuum domain. Fig. 1-3 shows the integrated response for the

IB atoms for the energy domain 0 -100 eV. The steep rise in I below 10 eV is due to the pair

of discrete transitions s, d → p given in Table II. One can also see a small feature around

50-70 eV due to the transition from a deeply p state to the partially occupied valence s state.

This transition is absent in the pseudopotential calculation. Note that the TDLDA strength

is quenched with respect to the independent-particle response by about 10-20% even up to

the higher energies. Comparing the pseudopotential and all-electron calculations, we see

that they are practically indistinguishable in the case of Cu and Ag. They also track well in

Au below 80 eV except for the energy of the lowest transition, as was noted in the previous

Unfortunately, there does not seem to exist experimental that one can compare to. Fig.

13 in ref. [25] shows a curve for Cu, but it was measured for a thin ﬁlm rather than the

paragraph.

III. CONCLUSION

We have found that the TDLDA with a pseudopotential approximation gives virtually

the same distribution of oscillator strength in the region 0 - 100 eV as the all-electron

theory of IB atoms, despite the fact that the f sum rule is badly violated by the state-

dependent interaction. We conclude that the pseudopotentials in these atoms properly

take into account many-body eﬀects by the nonlocality of the potential, and may be used

conﬁdence in studying the response of these elements.

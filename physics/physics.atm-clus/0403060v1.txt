Neutral silicon clusters Sin (up to n = 7) and their cations Si+

n (up to n = 10) have been
produced by femtosecond laser ablation of bulk silicon in vacuum and investigated using time-of-
ﬂight mass spectrometry. Two populations of the Si+
n clusters with diﬀerent velocity and abundance
distributions in the ablation plume have been clearly distinguished. Possible mechanisms of cluster
formation (Coulomb explosion, gas-phase condensation, phase explosion) are discussed.

Femtosecond laser ablation is a rapidly developing
technique oﬀering new possibilities in various applica-
tions. The fundamental mechanisms that lead to ma-
terial removal are, however, still poorly understood. The
interaction of fs laser pulses with silicon is an example
of a complex interplay of thermal and ultrafast, non-
thermal processes involved to ablation [1, 2, 3]. Studies of
composition and expansion dynamics of the laser-induced
plume can provide a considerable insight into the ablation
mechanisms. Several recent experiments on this subject
[2, 4, 5, 6] were mainly devoted to the atomic component
of the plume though an observation of small silicon clus-
ters was also mentioned [2]. Little is known about silicon
cluster formation under ablation with short laser pulses.
With ns pulses, low-ﬂuence desorption of Si dimers [7]
and small neutral Sin clusters [8] were observed. Desorp-
tion of small clusters from both crystalline and nanos-
tructured Si surfaces was induced by using high-energy
(6.4 eV) photons [9]. Multiple-charged cluster ions were
formed in ps-laser stimulated ﬁeld evaporation [10]. Re-
cently we reported the ﬁrst results on the observation
of neutral and cationic clusters under femtosecond laser
ablation of silicon [11]. In this work, we analyze mech-
anisms of clusters formation based on measurements of
the abundance and velocity distributions.

I. EXPERIMENT

The experiments were performed with Si[100] surface
under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (∼ 10−10 mbar). The
Si target was irradiated at a 45˚ incidence angle using
a Ti:sapphire laser (Mai-Tai coupled with a TSA ampli-
ﬁer, Spectra Physics, 80 fs pulse duration, 10 Hz rep-

etition rate, up to 30 mJ energy per pulse) operating
at 800 nm. A part of the laser beam was selected by
an aperture to provide a nearly uniform intensity dis-
tribution over the irradiated spot. The target was ro-
tated/translated during measurements to avoid consid-
erable cratering. Some experiments were performed with
the ﬁxed target in order to investigate the eﬀect of ac-
cumulation of laser pulses at the same spot. The ﬂuence
on the target was varied in the range 80-800 mJ/cm2.

The abundance distributions of neutral and positively
charged particles in the laser-ablation plume were stud-
ied using a reﬂectron time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer.
The neutral particles were analyzed using electron im-
pact ionization (110 eV) and a plasma suppressor [12].
At a distance of 11 cm from the target, the ablated or
post-ionized ions were sampled parallel to the plume axis
by a 500 V repeller pulse at a time delay td in respect
to the laser pulse. Mass spectra were averaged over 300
laser shots with the rotated target and over 5 shots with
the ﬁxed target.

II. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Monatomic Si+ ions and Si atoms are the most abun-
dant particles in the plume throughout the laser ﬂuence
range studied. The ion signal appears at a threshold ﬂu-
ence Fth ≈ 100 mJ/cm2 [11] for the etched Si surface
irradiated previously with a fairly large number of laser
pulses. Eﬃcient emission of both neutral silicon clusters
Sin (up to n = 7) and their cations Si+
n (up to n = 10)
has been observed for F > Fth. The cluster abundance
distributions are found to be essentially diﬀerent for the
fresh and etched ablated surfaces. Figure 1 shows a typ-
ical evolution of cation mass spectra with increasing the
number N of laser pulses applied to the same spot. The
spectra were obtained at time delay td, corresponding
to a maximum average yield of clusters. With the fresh
surface, the relatively large Si+
n clusters (n > 3) are ob-
served in high abundance with the ”magic” number at n

= 6 (Fig. 1a). In addition, doubly charged cluster ions
are present in the plume among which Si2+
is particu-
5
larly abundant (note that Si2+
5 was observed earlier as a
magic cluster in the ﬁeld evaporation experiment [10]).
The monatomic Si+ peak is relatively weak under these
conditions.

When the number of laser shots increases, the mass
spectrum is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed (Fig. 1b,c). The Si+
n
(n > 3) and Si2+
clusters are observed in lower abun-
5
dance (the latter almost disappears at N > 100) while
the concentration of the smaller species (n = 1-3) in-
creases progressively with N . After ∼40 laser shots, Si+
ion is totally dominant in the plume (this is not seen in
Fig. 1 since the Si+ signal is maximized at shorter time
delays). The cluster distribution exhibits an odd-even
alternation with preferred formation of even-numbered
Si+
n clusters. Further increase in the number of laser
pulses results in further decrease of the relative yield of
the cationic clusters. After few hundreds of laser shots
the signal saturates and the abundance distribution be-
comes rather smooth with peak intensities monotonously
decreasing with cluster size (Fig. 1c).

Typical mass spectra for neutral Sin clusters obtained
with the fresh and etched ablated surfaces are shown in
Fig. 2. The eﬀect of the number of accumulated laser
pulses is not so strong in this case though the same ten-
dency of decreasing in the relative yield for Sin clusters
(n > 4) is obvious. The odd-even alternation in the clus-
ter distribution is also observed at low N values (Fig. 2a)
but it is less pronounced than for cationic clusters.

The observed eﬀect of the number of applied laser
pulses on particle emission suggests an accumulation of
the laser-induced damage on the Si surface. Indeed, with
an optical microscope we observed clearly shaped spots at
the surface for very low ﬂuences down to approximately
150 mJ/cm2 (for multi-pulse conditions with ∼1000 laser
shots per spot). We can thus conclude that the dam-
age threshold is approximately equal to the ion desorp-
tion threshold for silicon under these conditions. The
low-ﬂuence damage (modiﬁcation) of Si surfaces with ul-
trashort laser pulses was observed earlier and attributed
to amorphization of silicon [13, 14]. The eﬀect of laser
pulse accumulation on the damage threshold (the incu-
bation eﬀect) was also revealed. The multi-pulse damage
threshold determined in [14] is well consistent with that
evaluated here. Similar incubation eﬀect in silicon was
observed recently with ns laser pulses [8, 15]. The pre-
cise nature of the incubation eﬀect is not clear (it can
be, e.g., due to chemical modiﬁcation, mechanical stress,
defect accumulation [14, 15]) and needs further investi-
gation.

Variation of the time delay td allowed the analysis of
particle velocity distributions and the characterization of
the temporal evolution of the plume composition. The
measurements were perfermed with the etched Si surface
when no signal change with the number of laser pulses
occurred. Figure 3 shows the time-of-ﬂight (TOF) dis-
tributions of several cationic particles for diﬀerent laser

ﬂuences. The distributions for Si+ ions are maximized at
∼9 µs time delay that corresponds to ∼12 km/s ion ve-
locity. Increase in ﬂuence results just in a broadening of
the distributions with little or no shift towards higher ve-
locities. At the same time, the yield of Si+ ions increases
strongly with ﬂuence as ∼ F n with n ≈ 7.5 [11].

In contrast to Si+ ions, the cluster TOF distributions
are found to be strongly ﬂuence-dependent. At low ﬂu-
ence, near the threshold value, the TOF distribution for
Si+
2 is rather narrow, single-peaked, and maximized at
∼
= 18 µs (Fig. 3a), that is the most probable velocity
td
is approximately two times lower than that of Si+. This
means that these plume particles have nearly the same
momentum. At 400 mJ/cm2, the distribution for Si+
2 is
still single-peaked but a noticeable shift towards higher
time delays is observed (the maximum occurs at ∼25
µs, the corresponding velocity is ∼ 4.4 km/s). The fast
Si+
2 dimers are still present in this ablation regime but
their distribution is masked by slower ions. With further

The evolution of TOF distributions for larger Si+

increase in laser ﬂuence, the second, even slower, popu-
lation of Si+
2 appears in the plume. At 550 mJ/cm2 this
slow population dominates (Fig. 3c). The ﬁrst faster
peak in the distribution is still present, well separated
from the second peak, and is still maximized at ∼25 µs.
n clus-
ters is qualitatively similar to that for Si+
2 as illustrated
in Fig. 3 for the S+
6 cation. At a threshold ﬂuence of
around 450 mJ/cm2, the distributions are transformed
from single-peaked to double-peaked. The second (slow)
cluster population becomes rapidly dominat with further
increase in ﬂuence. The most probable velocity of the sec-
ond population decreases slightly with cluster size from
2.5 km/s for Si+
2 to 2 km/s for Si+
6 . The abundance
distribution for this slow cluster population exhibits a
pronounced odd-even alternation with dominance of the
Si+
6 peak and similar to that observed at shorter delay
times with relatively fresh surface (Fig. 1a). It is thus
remarkably diﬀerent from the falling smooth distribution
for faster clusters (Fig. 1c).

Based on the obtained results, we can address the
fundamental question on cluster formation mechanism
under diﬀerent irradiation regimes. At very low laser
ﬂuence, from the ion appearance threshold Fth up to
∼2Fth, Si+ and Si+
2 ions are likely produced by an im-
pulsive Coulomb explosion (CE) from a charged surface.
Two observations support the CE mechanism [11, 16],

namely, (a) the momentum scaling for the particles un-
der low ﬂuence regimes and (b) decrease of velocity for
Si+
2 ions when ﬂuence is increased beyond ∼2Fth, that is
a behavior opposite to thermal desorption. The slower
Si+
n clusters (which overshadow the CE ions in the (2-
4)Fth ﬂuence range and form the fast cluster population
at higher ﬂuences) can be interpreted as ”plasma ions”,
i.e., ions formed in the ionized vapor plume by collision-
induced condensation. The velocities of these ”plasma
ions” decrease only slightly with cluster size and scale by
a law intermediate between constant kinetic energy and
constant velocity that implies the gas-phase condensation
mechanism rather than direct ejection of the clusters [12].
Of particular interest is the origin of very slow clus-

ter ions observed at high ﬂuences (F > 4.5Fth) as the
second population in the TOF distributions (Fig. 3c).
The evident separation of this population from the ﬁrst
one indicate that another mechanism is likely respon-
sible for its formation. We suggest that the slow ions
are due to phase explosion (PE) from the Si surface
melted via an ultrafast, non-thermal process which was
recently found for semiconductors under fs-laser irradia-
tion [1, 2, 3]. The fast excitation of a dense electron-hole
plasma causes destabilization of the lattice, and the semi-
conductor melts in a time less than 1ps. The non-thermal
melting occurs at ﬂuences fairly higher than needed for
purely thermal melting process. The melted surface, even
if its temperature is far below the thermodynamic critical
temperature, inevitably enters the region of metastable
states with the subsequent phase explosion as one of
probable stabilization mechanisms [17]. The overheated
liquid can decay into the gas phase without formation
of the critical vapor nucleus [17] so the ejection of small
clusters is quite possible. More work is needed to be
certain about the origin of the cluster ions under these
conditions but some observations support the PE mech-
anism. The amount of material released under the PE
is macroscopic and the ejected particles undergo many
collisions within the plume during their expansion into
vacuum. As a result, the most stable clusters survive
predominantly in the plume thus resulting in abundance
distributions with magic numbers. Numerous previous
investigations indicate special stability of Si+
7 , and

particularly Si+
6 [18]. This is well correlated with the ob-
served abundance distributions of the slow ions (similar
In addition, the observed

weak size dependence of cluster velocities for the second
population (Fig. 3c) correlate with recent simulations
of short-pulse laser ablation [19] where nearly the same
ﬂow velocities were obtained for clusters of diﬀerent size
ejected via the PE mechanism.

III. CONCLUSIONS

We have observed eﬃcient emission of both neutral and
cationic silicon clusters under femtosecond laser ablation
of silicon in vacuum. Cluster abundance and velocity dis-
tributions are found to depend strongly on laser ﬂuence
and the number of laser pulses applied. The obtained
results provide clear evidence that diﬀerent cluster for-
mation mechanisms (Coulomb explosion, gas-phase con-
densation, phase explosion) are involved. Further work
aimed at clarifying the contributions of these mechanisms
for various ablation conditions is currently under way.

Abstract

It is shown that the contribution to the induction which at an internal point of a spin
density distribution is mathematically described as a local is virtually caused by the
summing-up of the ﬁelds created by all elements of this distribution. Therefore, the
proportionality coeﬃcient between this contact (Fermi) ﬁeld and magnetic moment
density at the point of observation is equal to 8π/3 only for spherically symmetrical
s-shells. If the symmetry of spin density distribution lowers, the value of this coef-
ﬁcient becomes dependent on the spin direction. As a sequence, in low-symmetry
crystals and molecules additional anisotropic contributions to the hyperﬁne ﬁeld
emerge.

Introduction

Spin magnetic moments of electrons from proper shells of an isolated atom
are commonly treated to make two contributions to the hyperﬁne ﬁeld Bhf
on its nucleus [1]. The ﬁrst is the contact Fermi ﬁeld produced by s-electrons
[2], which in the Gauss system of units is equal to

BF = −

µB |Ψs (0)|2 σ.

The second is the dipole ﬁeld created by the distribution of density of spin
magnetic moment of electrons from the shells with non-zero orbital moment

In these formulas a nucleus is considered to be placed in the point of origin
r = 0; µB is the Bohr magneton; σ is the unit vector in the direction of the
spin moment of electron; Ψ (r) - the electron wave function whose subscript
in (1), (2) designates only the orbital moment of a shell.

The two ﬁelds (1) and (2) are created by two parts of the same distribution
of electronic spin moment density. Nevertheless, the contact Fermi ﬁeld (1)
apparently diﬀers from the dipole ﬁeld (2) in that it is dependent solely on
the value of the wave function at r = 0 whereas the latter is controlled by the
distribution of spin density all over around the nucleus. And what is more,
the BF value is independent of σ, while the value of Bdip depends on the σ
orientation relative to selected directions of the spin density distribution. That
is why it seems appropriate to formulate the following questions herein.

(i) Why does not the Fermi ﬁeld depend on the distribution of spin density
all over around the nucleus?

(ii) Why is the multiple in BF equal namely to 8π/3?

(iii) Would the BF value change if the shape of Ψs (r) changed whereas the
Ψs (0) value does not change?

In what follows the answers for these questions are proposed based in part on
the results related the ﬁeld acting on a muon at interstice in solids [4].

1 The local contribution to magnetic induction

In nonrelativistic quantum mechanics just as in classical electrodynamics,
magnetic ﬁeld of any magnetization distribution 1

M (r) = −µB |Ψ (r)|2 σ
is deﬁned by integral (2). If the point of observation r = 0 lies inside the dis-
tribution and the spin density does not vanish in this point, the under-integral
expression diverges. Using standard techniques of calculating the above im-
proper integral (see, for example, [3,5,4] ) and assuming that the magnetization
changes over the space continuously, one can obtain expression

1 In what follows we will not tell magnetization distribution from the distribution
of spin magnetic moment density.

In the essence, this is simply another form of the standard formula B =
4πM +H that deﬁnes the magnetic induction inside the magnetization dis-
tribution. The ﬁrst term herein can be called a local because it, as well as
the Fermi ﬁeld, is proportional to the magnetization value at the point of ob-
servation, though with another coeﬃcient. The second term in (4) explicitly
does not depend on M (0) and is determined only by the way of changing
magnetization over ambient space 2 .

Implicitly, however, the magnitude of integral contribution to (4) strongly
depends on the M (0) value. If M (0) = 0, as is the case of spin density of
electrons from atomic shells with l 6= 0 (when this contribution coincides with
(2)), M (r) ﬁrst increases upon moving oﬀ a nucleus and then vanishes at r →
∞. As is easily seen, the regions of increasing and decreasing magnetization
with r make contributions of diﬀerent senses into integral in (4). As a result,
the magnitude of hyperﬁne ﬁeld is controlled mainly by the distance from a
nucleus to the area where spin density is mostly localized, i.e., by the value
of parameter hr−3i. This designation in [1,6] was used for the radial part of
integral (2), and with the designation for the angular integral part taken also
after these authors, one can write the dipole contribution in the form

(σ · Bdip (σ)) = −µB

r−3

Unlike is the case when M (0) 6= 0 and magnetization falls monotonically to
zero with increasing r. Providing the distribution of magnetization is isotropic,
M (r) = M (r) (s-electrons), it vanishes at r = r(1)
0 where the ﬁrst node of
the radial s-function is located (for 1s-electrons r(1)
0 → ∞). The integral in
(4) over the region r > r(1)
is equal to zero (see below), and in the range
0
0 < r < r(1)
0 magnetization only lowers, so that this integral turns out rather
large. Besides, because of the spherical symmetry, it does not depend on the
form of function M (r) and always equals − 4π
3 M (0). It is the sum of two
terms in (4) that results in the Fermi ﬁeld (1).

What would change in the situation described if the part of spin density that
does not vanish at r→0 is not of spherical symmetry? To answer this ques-
tion it’s enough to distinguish the two parts of the spin density distribution.
The ﬁrst of them is spherically symmetrical afresh and creates the same ﬁeld
8πM (0)/3 at the point of observation. The second one has lower symmetry
and vanishes in this point, and hence its contribution to the ﬁeld is described
by the formula (5). So the ﬁeld at the point of observation now is not equal
to Fermi ﬁeld and, which is more, its value depends on M direction.

2 In the classical electrodynamics, it is the latter contribution that, together with
allowance for the discontinuity of magnetization on the body surface, determines
the demagnetizing ﬁeld.

3

For instance, in the case of the spin density distribution when the surfaces of
constant magnetization have the shape of ellipsoids, a well-known result [5] is
obtained from (4)

Bhf (r = 0, σ) = 4π [1 − N (σ)] M (r = 0) ,
where N (σ) is the demagnetizing factor of an ellipsoid. In other words, the
magnitude of integral in (4), still remaining proportional to M (0), turns out
dependent also on the direction of spin moment, which is designated as pre-
viously by symbol σ. For the spherically symmetrical distribution of magne-
tization this dependence disappears, N (σ) ≡ 1/3 so that 4π (1 − N ) = 8π/3
and one comes again to the Fermi ﬁeld (1).

(6)

Let us discuss now how local expressions (1) and (6) arise from the integral in
(4) . The matter is that a homogeneously magnetized layer that lies between
two similar ellipsoidlike surfaces (in particular, spherical layer) does not pro-
duce the ﬁeld inside [5]. Representing the whole magnetization distribution in
the form of an ”onion” consisting of such closely adjoined layers, we can take
oﬀ any external layers without changing ﬁeld in the center 3 . As a result, the
ﬁeld in the center turns out coinciding with the ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely small ho-
mogeneously magnetized ellipsoid, and the same conclusion follows from the
common simple method of calculating Fermi ﬁeld [3] as well.

However, it does not mean that the Fermi ﬁeld is produced solely by the
inﬁnitesimal central part of the spin density. It means only that for some
spin density distributions of high symmetry (in particular spherical, cubic
and ellipsoid-like symmetry) the sum of contributions to Bhf , produced by
the outer parts of the distribution, becomes equal to zero. This is not true for
the spin density distributions of lower symmetry, and to make matters worse,
in this case one can not ﬁnd unambiguously the part of the spin density that
does not vanish in the point of observation, i.e. the part that should create
the “contact” ﬁeld. If, in addition to this, one takes into account the Bhf
anisotropy, which is absent only in a spherically symmetrical case (1), to infer
on the ”locality” is hardly pertinent.

2 Spin density anisotropy and Fermi ﬁeld in crystals and molecules

Could, however, one expect that in an atom there is a part of spin density that
would lower monotonically and anisotropically upon moving oﬀ the nucleus? It

to not contribute to hyperﬁne ﬁeld.

is impossible of course in an isolated atom, but it may be the case in a crystal
of low-symmetry. Apparently, it is how, for example, the density of itinerant
electrons in crystals with the lattice symmetry lower than cubic should behave.
The simplest argument in favor of this quite evident statement can be obtained
in the approximation of almost free electrons. Consider an electronic state
|ki = exp (ikr) in the rhombic Γ0-type lattice. Let the perturbation potential
has the form

Hence, the distribution of spin density around the point of origin (the nucleus
of one of the atoms constituent the lattice) is already anisotropic. In the vicin-
ity of a nucleus, isolines of spin density turn out to have the form of ellipsoids
elongated the stronger, the greater is the diﬀerence in lattice parameters a, b
and c.

Similar anisotropy should arise in the opposite limiting case as well, i.e. in the
tight binding approximation, if to allow for the fact that the wave functions of
neighbors overlap the stronger, the closer they are located. To make it evident,
a study of the simplest case of a two-atom molecule is suﬃcient. Let us treat
an ionized hydrogen molecule H +
2 in which atomic nuclei have the coordinates
r1and r2, with the vector R = r2 − r1 being parallel to the z axis. The
ground-state wave function is chosen in the form

Here, ρ = R/a, a = a0/Z is the radius of the 1s orbit, which at R −→ ∞
is equal to the Bohr radius a0 and decreases when the atoms come closer [7].

This eﬀect is taken into account via introduction of an eﬀective nucleus charge
Z whose value is conditioned at each R by the minimal average energy of the
state (9).

The spin magnetization distribution in this state is the sum of two contribu-
tions:

This result can easily be obtained after simple reasoning similar to the above
with account for the fact that a homogeneously magnetized sphere creates
around the same ﬁeld as a point dipole placed in the center of the sphere and
having magnetic moment equal to that of the sphere.

The formula (11) looks like the standard expression for calculation of the ﬁeld
at an atomic nucleus in a crystal, which includes the Fermi contribution and
the dipole ﬁelds created by the neighboring magnetic atoms. However, in this
case, the homogeneous and equal to σ exp (−2ρ) /Q2 part of the spin density
distribution, which is concentrated inside the sphere with a radius R and the
center located at the neighboring site, contributes solely to the Fermi ﬁeld. The
dipole ﬁeld is given rise to only by a heterogeneous part of this distribution
so that the magnetic moment entering into Bdip (11) is equal

As a result, with decreasing R, the anisotropic contribution Bdip reaches its
maximum and vanishes at R → 0, rather then increases proportionally to

The second contribution to the magnetization M 2 (r) arises because of the
interference of the atomic states in (9). The surfaces M2 (r) = const are
the ellipsoids of revolution, with the eccentricity tending to zero at |r − r1| +
|r − r2| −→ R. Again, with the considerations similar to the above-employed,
it is easy to show that the contribution of M 2 into the magnetic ﬁeld induction
has the same value and direction at the nuclei and at every point of the segment
that connects them. Just as the Fermi ﬁeld, this contribution is proportional
to the magnitude M 2 (r), which is constant at every point of the segment and
equal to −2µBσ exp (−ρ) /Q2. Therefore, the ﬁeld induction related to M 2 is
determined by the formula similar to (6):

Thus, in the H +
2 molecule, with decreasing spacing, not only the hyperﬁne ﬁeld
at the nuclei as such increases (chemical shift) but its anisotropy as well. In
this case, about half the anisotropy contribution is ascribed to the anisotropic
part of the Fermi ﬁeld related to hybridization of the atomic orbitals. The
same eﬀect should evidently arise also in crystals in which the distances from
a magnetic ion to its closest neighbors in diﬀerent directions strongly vary,
which leads to various overlapping of their outer s-shells.

In general, the value of local contribution to the induction (4) is controlled by
the form of dependence div (M ) on coordinates. If the spin part of the wave
function does not depend on r, i.e. M (r) is directed parallel to z-axe in any
point, div (M ) has the form

div (M (r)) =

The ﬁrst term in this formula having been integrated on r in (4) always gives

3 M (0). The result of the integration of the second term in common case
is the functional of M (r). In particular, if M (r) = M (r) Φ (θ, ϕ), as is the
case for atomic states with l 6= 0, the value of
this functional depends on
hr−3i just as in (5). For the result of this integration to be, alike the Fermi
ﬁeld (6), proportional solely to M (0), the M (r) dependence should have the
special form

M (r) = M (r · Φ (θ, ϕ))
(15)
where M and Φ are any suﬃciently smooth functions. Taking into account

The atomic s-state is a trivial (the angular dependence is absent) particular
case of spin density distribution (15). The other examples of distributions of
this type are ellipsoid-like distribution or a distribution with cubic symmetry.

In order that the spin density distribution for an isolated atom turns out a

8

function of the type (15), its ground state should be mixed to by the states
of the continuous spectrum. Such mixing up actually arises when an atom
is located in an electrical ﬁeld, in particular, the crystalline electrical ﬁeld.
However, calculation of the corresponding contribution to the Fermi ﬁeld is a
serious mathematical problem, which requires special treatment.

3 Conclusions

Returning to the questions posed at the beginning of the paper, we now can
formulate the following conclusions.

(i) The contact contribution to the induction at internal point of any magneti-
zation distribution virtually results from the summing up of the ﬁelds created
by all elements of this distribution.

(ii) The value of the proportionality coeﬃcient between the induction and
magnetic moment density at a point of observation is controlled by the sym-
metry of the magnetization distribution. This coeﬃcient is isotropic and equal
to 8π/3 only for distributions with a spherical or cubical symmetry.

(iii) In molecules and crystals of a lower symmetry owing to the hybridization
of the states of neighboring atoms, the symmetry of the s-electron density
distribution around the nucleus decreases. This results not only in the propor-
tionality coeﬃcient between the induction and magnetic-moment density at
the point of observation changes, but starts depend on the moment direction.

It should be underlined also, that the main result of this paper reduces to the
substantiation of a very simple statement: individualization of the Fermi ﬁeld
from the total hyperﬁne ﬁeld becomes empty of meaning for low-symmetry
crystals and molecules. The calculation of the ﬁeld created by a spin density
distribution of low symmetry should be performed by the formula (4) or some
equivalent to it. The standard presentation of hyperﬁne ﬁeld as the sum of the
Fermi (1), dipole and Lorentz ﬁelds and demagnetizing ﬁeld of the specimen
results in masking the role of the spin density inhomogeniouties, which may
be the source of some faults.

Allowance for this circumstance may be quite important when analyzing the
results of the hyperﬁne ﬁeld measurements. The case in hand may be both the
ﬁelds acting on a probe particle (neutron, muon and others) in the interstices
[4], and the ﬁeld on an atomic nucleus in a crystal or molecule. In all these
cases, with a proper account for the contribution of collective electrons and/or
distortions of the atomic s-shells, additional anisotropic contributions to the
Fermi ﬁeld can emerge. In particular, one could not exclude that the high (up

9

to 3 ÷ 4 T ) anisotropy of the hyperﬁne ﬁeld at the nuclei of iron atoms that
constitute the dumb-bells in the compounds R2F e17 [8,9,10] is related to this
eﬀect rather then to unquenching of orbital moments.

I. INTRODUCTION

Symmetry adaptation techniques, based on the use of chains of groups O(3)

G, have

been developed by many authors in the last twenty years. In particular, numerous studies have

been achieved in connection with crystal- and ligand-ﬁeld theories (see Refs. [1-3] and references

⊃

therein).

The aim of this paper is to show how Wigner-Racah calculus for a chain of type O(3)

G

(in terms of simple or double groups) can be applied to the determination of the intensity of two-
photon transitions for an ion with conﬁguration nℓN in a molecular or solid-state environment

⊃

with symmetry G. (For classiﬁcation and symmetry-breaking purposes, the group G may be
replaced by a chain of subgroups of O(3), the relevant symmetry group being one of the groups

of the chain.)

The rˆole of symmetries in two-photon spectroscopy of partly-ﬁlled shell ions in ﬁnite sym-

metry, of interest in molecular and solid-state physics, is touched upon in Refs. [4-8]. In Ref. [7],

the accent is put on the transition matrix elements between initial and ﬁnal state vectors while

emphasize is on the intensity strength in Ref. [8] and in the present paper.

Two distinct cases are studied in this work. The case of (nℓN

nℓN ) intra-conﬁgurational
two-photon transitions, which are parity allowed, is worked out in section II and the one of
(nℓN
parity forbidden, is examined in section III.

The two summations in (1) have to be extended over all the (virtual) intermediate states v
having a parity diﬀerent from the one of the states i and f . Furthermore, we have

∆λ = ¯hωλ −

λ = 1, 2

where Ev is the energy of the state v with respect to that of the state i and ¯hωλ the energy of
the photon no. λ. (For Raman scattering, the sign of ¯hω2 has to be changed.) In equation (1),

in the standard spherical basis (~e−1, ~e0, ~e+1). In the case of a linear polarization, the angles
(θλ, ϕλ) are the polar angles of the polarization vector ~
Eλ (λ = 1, 2) with respect to the crystal-
lographic axis. For two-photon absorption, only one sum occurs in (1) when the two photons

are identical.

Equation (1) can be derived from the time-dependent perturbation theory [9,10] and goes

back to the work of G¨oppert-Mayer. It is also possible to derive it, in an elegant way, from the

method of the resolvent operator [10,11].

State vectors

The initial state i with symmetry Γ is characterized by the state vectors

iΓγ) where γ

The only good quantum numbers for the initial and ﬁnal state vectors are Γγ and Γ′γ′,
respectively. Although, the state vectors (7) and (9) are developed in a weak-ﬁeld basis, it is to

be noted that the intensity calculation to be conducted in what follows is valid for any (weak-,
intermediate- or strong-ﬁeld) coupling scheme. The expansion coeﬃcients c(αSLJaΓ; i) and
c(α′S′L′J ′a′Γ′; f ) can be obtained by optimizing an Hamiltonian involving at least Coulomb,
spin-orbit and crystal-ﬁeld interactions ; the introduction of more sophisticated interactions

in the Hamiltonian may be useful to take covalency eﬀects into account [3]. Alternatively,

the expansion coeﬃcients in (7) and (9) can be considered as free parameters entering in the

phenomenological intensity parameters to be introduced below.

Transition matrix element

By using a quasi-closure approximation, it can be shown that the transition matrix element

In equation (11), W(kS kL)k is an electronic double tensor of spin rank kS, orbital rank kL and
total rank k. The information on the polarization of the two photons is contained in the tensor
(k) of rank k = 0, 1 or 2. The right-hand side of (11) is a development in terms
product
of scalar products ( . ) with expansion coeﬃcients C [(kSkL) k]. These coeﬃcients depend on
the ground conﬁguration nℓN and on the conﬁgurations nℓN−1n′ℓ′ and/or n′ℓ′4ℓ

the standard theory originally developed by Axe [12]. The other contributions (kS 6

possible to ﬁnd an expression for the parameters C [(kSkL) k]. For example, for the contribution

Intensity formula

The quantity of interest for a comparison between theory and experiment is the intensity

intensity is given by

Rule 2. The sum over k and ℓ in the intensity formula (21) is partially controlled by the

For most of the cases of interest, there is no summation on r and s, two branching mul-
tiplicity labels of type a, in the intensity formula (21). (In other words, the frequency of Γ′′
in (kg) and (ℓg) is rarely greater than 1.) The group-theoretical selection rules (27) and (28)
impose strong limitations on the summation over Γ′′ in (21) once Γ and Γ′ are ﬁxed and the
range of values of k and ℓ is chosen.

The number of independent intensity parameters I[

] in the formula (21) is determined
by : (i) the nature of the photons, cf. Rule 2 ; (ii) the group G, cf. Rule 1 ; (iii) the symmetry
property (24), cf. Property 1 ; (iv) the use of kS = 0 (second-order mechanism) or kS = 0
and kS 6
= 0 (second- plus third-order mechanisms), cf. Rule 2 ; (v) the kind of the (weak-,
intermediate- or strong-ﬁeld) coupling used for the state vectors, cf. equations (22) and (23).

· · ·

Points (i)-(iii) depend on external physical conditions. On the other hand, points (iv) and
(v) are model-dependent. In particular, in the case where the J-mixing, cf. point (v), can be
neglected, a situation of interest for lanthanide ions, the summations on k and ℓ in (21) are

The computation, via equations (22) and (23), of the I parameters generally is a diﬃcult

task. Therefore, they may be considered, at least in a ﬁrst step, as phenomenological parameters.
In this respect, equations (22) and (23) should serve as a guide for reducing the number of I

parameters.

Once the number of independent parameters I[

] in the intensity formula (21) has been
determined, we can obtain the polarization dependence of the intensity strength SΓ→Γ′ by

tions from the initial state i = 3A2(T2) to the ﬁnal states taken as the ﬁrst excited states
f = 3T2(E, T1, T2, A2). Therefore, we have Γ = T2 for the initial state and Γ′ = A2, E, T1, T2

for the various ﬁnal states. Furthermore, there is no sum on the multiplicity labels r and s in

the intensity formula (21). Let us begin with non-identical photons. Then, the possible values
of k and ℓ in (21) are 0, 1, 2. Since the restriction SO(3)

ST2→T2 = 3 aT2T2 (2E) + 2 aT2T2 (2T2)

ST2→T1 = 3 aT2T1 (2E) + 2 aT2T1 (2T2)

ST2→E = 2 aT2E(2T2)

ST2→A2 = 0

for circular polarization (the two photons having the same circular polarization) and by

ST2→T2 = aT2T2 (0A1) ̟1 + aT2T2 (2E) ̟2 + aT2T2 (2T2) ̟3 + aT2T2 (1T1) ̟4

ST2→T1 = aT2T1 (2E) ̟2 + aT2T1 (2T2) ̟3 + aT2T1 (1T1) ̟4

ST2→E = aT2E(2T2) ̟3 + aT2E(1T1) ̟4

ST2→A2 = aT2A2 (1T1) ̟4

We now continue with the particular case where the two photons are identical. In this case, we
get ̟4 ≡
0 so that the number of independent parameters in equations (36) and (37) is reduced
from 10 to 6 : the parameter aT2T2(0A1) describes third-order mechanisms while the parameters
aT2T2 (2E), aT2T2(2T2), aT2T1 (2E), aT2T1 (2T2) and aT2E(2T2) may be thought to mainly describe
second-order mechanisms.

Similar results hold for the other intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions of nd8 in O.
For example, let us consider the transition between the inital state i = 3A2(T2) with Γ = T2
and the ﬁnal state f = 3T1(A1) with Γ′ = A1. By putting

aT2A1 (2T2) =

I[22T2; T2A1]

we obtain (for identical or non-identical photons)

ST2→A1 = aT2A1 (2T2) ̟3

or

2 aT2A1(2T2)

according to as the polarization is linear or circular.

Indeed, all the two-photon transitions arising from an initial state of symmetry T2 are given
by formulas of the type (36), (37) and (39). The formulas (36) and (37) generalize to the case of

non-identical photons the formulas for identical photons derived in Ref. [18] in order to explain
the experimental results of Ref. [17] concerning Ni2+ in MgO.

III. INTER-CONFIGURATIONAL TWO-PHOTON TRANSITIONS

Sketch of the theory

We now consider two-photon transitions between Stark levels arising from the conﬁgurations

nℓN and nℓN−1n′ℓ′ of opposite parities ((
with identical photons. The initial and ﬁnal state vectors are (respectively) taken in the form

vectors (41) and (42) with state vectors of the type

This may be achieved by using ﬁrst-order perturbation theory where the polluting agent is the
crystal-ﬁeld potential H3 of odd order, which is static or dynamic according to as the group G

Then, we apply a quasi-closure approximation both for the initial, intermediate (virtual), and

ﬁnal state vectors and the transition matrix element. This approximation can be summarized

We thus obtain a closed form formula for Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′).

IV. CLOSING REMARKS

⊃

We have shown how O(3)

G symmetry adaptation allows to derive intensity formulas

for intra- and inter-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions for ions in molecular or solid-state

environments.

In particular, the number of independent parameters required for describing

the polarization dependence of the transitions is determined by an ensemble of properties and

rules which combine symmetry and physical considerations. The main results of this paper are

equations (21) and (47) for intra- and inter-conﬁgurational transitions, respectively. The case

of intra-conﬁgurational transitions has been treated in detail. The case of inter-conﬁgurational

symmetry shall be developed again in forthcoming papers and in the thesis by one of us [11].

The reader should consult Refs. [18,19] where symmetry adaptation techniques, in the

spirit of the present paper, have been applied to rare-earth and transition-metal ions in various

symmetries.

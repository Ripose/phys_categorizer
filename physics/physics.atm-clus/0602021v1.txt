Abstract

We perform density functional theory calculations using Gaussian atomic-orbital methods within

the generalized gradient approximation for the exchange and correlation to study the interactions

in the bare and hydrogenated platinum clusters. The minimum-energy structures, binding ener-

gies, relative stabilities, vibrational frequencies and the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied

molecular-orbital gaps of PtnHm (n=1-5, m=0-2) clusters are calculated and compared with pre-

viously studied pure platinum and hydrogenated platinum clusters. We investigate any magic

behavior in hydrogenated platinum clusters and ﬁnd that Pt4H2 is more stable than its neighbor-

ing sizes. Our results do not agree with a previous conclusion that 3D geometries of Pt tetramer

and pentamer are unfavored. On the contrary, the lowest energy structure of Pt4 is found to be a

distorted tetrahedron and that of Pt5 is found to be a bridge site capped tetrahedron which is a

new global minimum for Pt5 cluster. The successive addition of H atoms to Ptn clusters leads to

an oscillatory change in the magnetic moment of Pt3 - Pt5 clusters.

INTRODUCTION

The study of hydrogen interaction with metals has gained an increased interest in the

last decade [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The use of metal and semiconductor clusters as components

of nanodevices, the development of cluster-based materials and the catalytic properties of

clusters are the main reasons for the studies of interaction of atoms and molecules with

clusters. Understanding hydrogen interaction with clusters is important because of two basic

reasons: ﬁrst, there is a great interest in developing novel hydrogen absorbing nanomaterials

for fuel cell applications, second, many of the organic materials and biological systems

contain hydrogen which are involved important catalytic reactions. In particular, platinum

is one of the most important ingredients in the heterogeneous catalysis of hydrogenation as

well as in the catalysis of the CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons. Moreover, detailed investigations

of the interaction between platinum clusters with hydrogen can contribute to the design of

useful hydrogen storage devices. Therefore, it is of interest to understand the interaction of

one and two H atoms on platinum clusters.

A brief summary of the previous theoretical and experimental studies on the pure plat-

inum clusters can be found in our recent publications [8]. The following references can

be added to them: Gr¨onbeck and Andreoni [9] have presented a density functional theory

(DFT) study of Au2-Au5 and Pt2-Pt5 clusters in the neutral and anionic states. Xiao and

Wang [10] have studied Pt clusters of up to 55 atoms using DFT with a plane wave basis

set and Tian et al. [11] have reported the geometrical and electronic structure of the Pt7

cluster in a DFT study with a Gaussian type basis set. One of the earliest ab initio studies

on the Pt-H2 reaction was published by the group of Poulain [12] in 1986. The same group

carried out theoretical studies on the Pt2-H2 [13], and Pt4-H2 [2] interactions later. Naka-

suji et al. [14] accomplished an ab initio study on the reactions of the hydrogen molecule

with small Ptn (n=1-3) clusters. In 1987, Balasubramanian’s [15] calculations on electronic

states and potential energy surfaces of PtH2 has been published. Later, he and Feng [16]

have reported a study on the potential energy surfaces for the Pt2-H and Pt-H interactions.

The Pt3-H2 interactions have been studied by Dai et al. [17] and Cui et al. [18].

On the experimental side, molecular beam techniques have been used to investigate the

hydrogen molecule interaction with metal surfaces [19]. The chemical reactivity of metal

clusters in gas phase with hydrogen and deuterium has been studied with the laser vapor-

2

ization technique [20].

In a most recent study, Andrews et al. [21] have investigated the

reaction of Pt atoms with H2 in a laser-ablation experiment and have also performed some

DFT calculations. In the experiments it is observed that the reactivity of the small metal

clusters with the hydrogen and deuterium molecules strongly depends on the size of the small

metal clusters [22]. Luntz et al. [23] found that there are reaction paths with or without

very low barriers, leading to the H2 dissociation on the Pt (111) surfaces.

In the present work, we report the results of ﬁrst-principles total-energy calculations on

small platinum clusters with up to two H atoms. We perform DFT calculations using

Gaussian atomic-orbital methods within the generalized gradient approximation for the

exchange and correlation to study the interactions in the bare and hydrogenated platinum

clusters. The possible minima and ground states, binding energies (BE), relative stabilities,

and the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular-orbital (HOMO-LUMO)

gaps of the PtnHm (n=1-5, m=0-2) clusters have been calculated. Vibrational frequency

calculations for each optimized structure has been carried out to diﬀerentiate local minima

from transition states. The results are compared with previously studied pure platinum

and hydrogenated platinum clusters. Systematic growth in the atom number allows one to

monitor the changes in the structure, dynamics, and electronic properties involved with the

size of the clusters. This can provide an understanding of the nature of interaction between

hydrogen and Pt clusters.

II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

DFT calculations have been performed by using version 4.7 of the NWChem program [24].

We have employed the LANL2DZ [25] basis set for the Pt atoms, which uses relativistic

eﬀective core potentials (ECP) to reduce the number of electrons explicitly considered in

the calculation, and 6-311++G** basis set for the H atoms. The ECP parameters for

platinum and the basis set, as well as similar basis sets to the one employed in this study

for the hydrogen have been successfully used in many previous studies [7, 11, 12, 13, 21]. To

examine the eﬀect of the choice of the exchange-correlation functional, we have calculated

the properties of H and Pt dimers and those of PtH diatomic molecule by using diﬀerent

functionals: We have employed PW91PW91 [26] and BPW91 [26, 27] functionals within

the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), SVWN5 [28] functional within the local

3

density approximation (LDA), and B3LYP [26, 29] and B98PW91 [26, 30] methods as hybrid

functionals. At the end of the examination which is discussed in the next section, we have

chosen the BPW91 method to study PtnHm clusters. The default NWChem geometry

optimization convergence criteria were used in all cases. Initial structures have been relaxed

without imposing any symmetry constraints. The ﬁnal structures therefore include possible

Jahn-Teller distortions. Whenever the optimized structure has had a symmetry other than

C1, the relaxation process has been repeated with that symmetry constraints starting from

the optimized geometry in order to get the electronic state. Spin-polarized calculations have

been done for the ﬁrst two multiplicities of the clusters up to Pt4H. Thus, singlet and triplet

states have been worked out for those having even number of electrons and doublet and

quartet states have been worked out for those having odd number of electrons. In addition,

we have also studied the quintet states of Pt4H2, Pt5 and Pt5H2 clusters, and sextet states

of Pt5H clusters. The reason for this is discussed in Sec. III D. All ﬁgures were produced by

the ChemCraft graphics program [31].

A. Eﬀect of Exchange-Correlation Functional

Table I displays the calculated and experimental values of the bond lengths, vibrational

frequencies and BEs for H and Pt dimers and for PtH diatomic molecule. The experimental

results of H2, Pt2, and PtH are from Refs. [32, 33], Refs. [34, 35, 36], and Refs. [32, 37],

respectively. In our calculations, the hybrid method B3LYP has produced the nearest bond

lengths to the experimental values of both H2 and PtH molecules. However, it has resulted in
the worst bond length (2.47 ˚A) for Pt2 (experimental value is 2.33 ˚A). Therefore, it highly

underestimates the BE of Pt dimer by calculating only a half of the experimental value.

When a second hybrid functional B98PW91 is considered, it can be seen in Table I that

although the results for Pt2 are improved as compared to the results of the B3LYP method,

it still overestimates the bond length and underestimates the BE of the dimer signiﬁcantly.

On the other hand, the SVWN5 LDA method has produced very good results for the bond

lengths of all of the three molecules. However, when the BEs are taken into account, it

is not favorable, too. It highly overestimates Pt2 and PtH BEs. We have tried two GGA

methods for the properties of the three diatomic molecules: PW91PW91 and BPW91. Both

of them have resulted in nearly the same bond lengths which are excellent for H2 and PtH,

4

and very good for Pt2. The errors in the bond length of Pt2 produced by GGA methods are

only 1.7%. They have also calculated reasonably good BEs for Pt2 and PtH. PW91PW91

functional has produced a slightly better result for the BE of PtH than BPW91. However,

the later has calculated much better Pt2 BE than the former. Therefore, we have decided

to employ BPW91 functional in the rest of our calculations. The error produced by the

chosen method in the BE of H molecule (9.5% ) is not very important in the present study

since the H atoms in the PtnHm clusters do not bind together as we discuss in the following

sections. As a result, we have performed all the remaining computations of the hydrogenated

Pt clusters at the BPW91/LANL2DZ and BPW91/6-311++G** levels of theory.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Bare Pt Clusters: Pt2-Pt5

We start to report the obtained results with bare Pt clusters.

Pt2: It can be seen from Table I and Table II that the chosen DFT method produces

reasonably good results for the BE, vibrational frequency and the bond length of the Pt

dimer. We have determined the electronic state of the dimer as 3∆g which is not consistent
with Balasubramanian’s [15] result that a 3Σ−

g is the ground state. The singlet state turns

out to be 1.39 eV less stable than the triplet. Both of the references [9] and [10] have

reported the ground state of the dimer as a triplet, however none of them has given any
electronic state. Xiao and Wang [10] have calculated 3.52 eV BE, 2.34 ˚A bond distance

and 0.81 eV HOMO-LUMO gap in their DFT study with ultrasoft pseudopotentials. The

best energy and bond length values of Gr¨onbeck and Andreoni [9] obtained by employing
BLYP exchange correlation functional are 3.58 eV and 2.32 ˚A, respectively. For both of
these studies, the bond distance values are closer to the experimental data (2.33 ˚A) than
our result (2.37 ˚A), however the method employed in this work results better in the energy

since it calculates 3.36 eV BE which is closer to the experimental data (3.14 eV) than the

previous calculations. Balasubramanian [15] has reported the obtained Pt-Pt distance as
2.46 ˚A which is the worst among all of the above mentioned references. We have calculated

1.32 eV HOMO-LUMO gap which is signiﬁcantly higher than the one given in Ref. [10].

Our result for the β spin HOMO-LUMO gap (0.33 eV) is in agreement with the calculation

5

of Tian et al. [11] (0.3 eV).

Pt3: The isomeric structures, symmetries, ground electronic states, total BEs, HOMO-

LUMO gaps (α spin), and the highest and the lowest vibrational frequencies of Pt2-Pt5
clusters are given in Table II. The pictures of these isomers and the bond lengths (in ˚A)

in these structures are presented in Fig. 1. We have studied the equilateral and isosceles

triangle structures of the Pt trimer, and found out that the optimized bond lengths of

these two geometries are very similar (see Fig. 1 (3-1) and (3-2)). Therefore, the energy

separation between them is very small. All Pt-Pt distances in the equilateral triangle are
2.53 ˚A which can be compared with the result of Gr¨onbeck and Andreoni [9] (2.41 ˚A). The
ground electronic state of the D3h symmetry is 3E′′ whereas that of C2v symmetry is 3B2.

The BEs and the HOMO-LUMO gaps for both of these structures are 6.57 eV and 1.05 eV,

respectively.

Pt4: We have identiﬁed three stable structures of Pt4: a distorted tetrahedron (4-1), an

out of plane rhombus (4-2), and a planar Y-like shape (4-3). A square isomer has been found

to be a ﬁrst order transition state in our calculations. The distorted tetrahedron with C2

symmetry and 3B electronic state is 0.1 eV more stable than the rhombus, whereas the BE

of the rhombus is 0.29 eV higher than the BE of the third isomer. The HOMO-LUMO gaps

and the lowest and highest vibrational frequencies of these clusters can be found in Table II.

Previously, Gr¨onbeck and Andreoni [9] have reported the global minimum to be a slightly

out of plane rhombus in the triplet. Xiao and Wang [10] have found a distorted tetrahedron

with Cs symmetry as the lowest energy structure in their plane wave calculations. Dai and

Balasubramanian [38] have performed MRSDCI calculations and a regular tetrahedron in a

triplet state was determined to be the ground state.

Pt5: A bridge site capped tetrahedron (5-1), a rhombus pyramid (5-2), a trigonal bipyra-

mid (5-3), an X-like (5-4) and an W-like (5-5) geometries are the low-energy structures

of Pt5. This is the ﬁrst time, to the best of our knowledge, that the bridge site capped

tetrahedron (5-1) is identiﬁed as the global minimum of Pt5. It is in the quintet state and

0.09 eV more stable than the second isomer. The second isomer (rhombus pyramid) is also

in the quintet state, whereas the other three locally stable structures are in triplet. The

HOMO-LUMO gap (0.69 eV) of the lowest energy structure (5-1) is also higher than that

of the other isomers. Therefore, it is expected to be more stable than the other structures.

The BE of the rhombus pyramid is 0.07 eV higher than the BE of the trigonal bipyramid.

6

The energy separation of the almost planar X-like and W-like structures from the 3D con-

ﬁgurations is more than 0.04 eV. In Ref. [9], BLYP calculations have predicted the lowest

energy isomer to be the planar W-like shape and LDA calculations have placed a distorted

square pyramid at low energies. In Ref. [10], the trigonal bipyramid has been found as the

global minimum in the quintet state.

According to the results presented here, the claim that 3D geometries for Pt tetramer

and pentamer are unfavored is not true. In addition, the HOMO-LUMO gaps for Pt2-Pt5

obtained in our calculations (1.32, 1.05, 0.44, and 0.69 eV, respectively) are generally much

greater than the previous calculations (0.7, 0.2, 0.3, and 0,2 eV in Ref. [9], and 0.81, 0.034,

0.28, and 0.63 eV in Ref. [10]).

B. One and Two Hydrogens on Pt Clusters

The relaxed structures and bond lengths of one and two H atoms on small Pt clusters

are shown in Fig. 2, while the symmetries, electronic states, BEs, HOMO-LUMO gaps (α

spin) and the highest and the lowest vibrational frequencies are given in Table III.

PtH: Considering ﬁrst the interaction of H with a Pt atom will be instructive. We have

calculated the BE of the PtH molecule in the doublet state as 3.28 eV, which is close to the

experimental data [32] of 3.44 eV. In fact, as discussed by Balasubramanian and Feng [16]

the experimental value should be regarded as only an upper bound. They have reported the

ground state BE as 3.11 eV by employing the CASSCF/SOCI/RCI method in 1989 [16].

We have identiﬁed the electronic ground state of the molecule as 2∆ which is in agrement

with both the experimental [37] and Balasubramanian’s theoretical results [16]. Andrews

et al. [21] have investigated PtHn (n=1-3) clusters by employing the B3LYP and BPW91

density functionals with 6-311+G**, 6-311++G(3df,3pd) and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets for H,

and LANL2DZ and SDD pseudopotentials for Pt. In their study, the ground state has been

determined as 2Σ+, however no BE has been given. We have computed the bond length
of PtH as 1.528 ˚A which is also in very good agreement with the experimental value [37]
of 1.529 ˚A. It is determined as 1.55 ˚A in Ref. [16] and as 1.531 ˚A in Ref. [21]. When the
vibrational frequency is considered, the experimental data [37] is 2294 cm−1. Our result is
2420 cm−1 whereas Ref. [16] and Ref. [21] have reported 2177 and 2370 cm−1, respectively.

It should be noted here that all frequencies given in this work are determined without using

7

any scale factor. If they were scaled by a proper factor for the chosen method, they would

be more accurate. The HOMO-LUMO gap of PtH is 3.02 eV which is the largest gap among

all the clusters we have studied here. Since the total energy of Pt2 and H2 (7.66 eV) is bigger

than the energy of 2PtH (6.56 eV), one can expect the abundance of the PtH molecule in

an environment of atomic hydrogen rather than in an environment of molecular hydrogen.
PtH2: PtH2 has a waterlike structure as shown in Fig. 2 (1b) with an angle of 85.9◦. This
angle was reported previously as 85◦ by Balasubramanian [15] and as 85.7◦ by Andrews et
al. [21]. As in the case of the angle, our result for the bond length (1.517 ˚A) is in very
good agreement with the previous calculation (1.520 ˚A) [21] . All of these studies (Ref. [15],

Ref. [21], and the present paper) identify the ground state of the PtH2 molecule to be 1A1. It

can be seen from Table III that the BE of H on PtH (3.58 eV) is 0.30 eV higher than the BE

of H on Pt atom (3.28 eV). Thus, PtH2 is a bit more stable than PtH when H separations

from these molecules are considered. Although the HOMO-LUMO gap of PtH2 (2.49 eV)

is smaller than that of PtH, it is still a big gap. We have found PtH2 to be 6.86 eV more

stable than the ground state Pt atom and two ground state H atoms. In order to dissociate

H2 molecule from PtH2, 2.55 eV is needed. This energy may be compared with earlier

calculations: 2.15 eV [21], 1.73 eV [14], and 2.04 - 2.21 eV [15]. We have determined the
lowest, middle and the highest vibrational frequencies as 793, 2455, 2490 cm−1. In Ref. [21],

the corresponding frequencies are computed in the following ranges by employing diﬀerent
methods and basis sets: 784 - 805, 2414 - 2456, 2455 - 2513 cm−1. The H-H distance in PtH2
is 2.07 ˚A, which is signiﬁcantly greater than the bond length of H2 (0.74 ˚A). Therefore, the

interaction between Pt and H2 is dissociative.

Pt2H: There are two possible ways of H bonding on the Pt dimer: on the bridge site

(Fig. 2 (2b) which is an isosceles triangle) and on the top site (Fig. 2 (2c) which is a planar

V-like shape with Cs symmetry). Diﬀerent electronic states of the bridge structure have

been studied in Ref. [16] before and a 2A2 state has been identiﬁed as the ground state,
which is in full agreement with our result. 2.53 ˚A of the Pt-Pt distance and 1.75 ˚A of the
Pt-H distance given in that study can be compared with the present results of 2.50 ˚A and
1.71 ˚A, respectively. We have determined the ground state of the top structure to be a 4A′′

state. The energy diﬀerence between the quartet and doublet states of this geometry is 0.50

eV. The BEs of H on the bridge and top sites of Pt2 are 2.73 eV and 2.25 eV, respectively.

Since these energies are particularly high it can be concluded that Pt2 is a reactive molecule.

8

The bonding on the bridge site is 0.48 eV more favorable than the bonding on the top site.

On the other hand, the HOMO-LUMO gap of (2c) structure (2.57 eV) is much greater than

that of (2b) structure (1.26 eV). Thus, the further reaction of the isosceles triangle to make

Pt2H2 can occur easier than that of the V-like structure. In the V-like structure, the Pt-Pt
and Pt-H distances are reduced to 2.44 ˚A and 1.56 ˚A.

Pt2H2: We have identiﬁed three stable structures of Pt2H2; (i) both H atoms are on the

bridge site (Fig. 2 (2d)), (ii) both of them are on the top sites of diﬀerent Pt atoms (Fig. 2

(2e)), and (iii) both of them are on the top site of the same Pt atom (Fig. 2 (2f)). An initial

geometry of a bridge-top conﬁguration takes the (2e) form at the end of the optimization

process. The singlet states of all of these three structures are more stable than their triplet

states. Among the three local minima, (2e) form has the biggest BE (9.29 eV). The HOMO-

LUMO gap of the (2f) form (0.09 eV) is signiﬁcantly small, therefore it is expected to react
further to make Pt3H2 or Pt2H3. The H-H distance in (2f) is 2.05 ˚A which is again much

bigger than the bond distance in the H molecule. Therefore, the H adsorption on Pt dimer

is also dissociative.

Pt3H: Interaction of H on Pt3 is slightly favorable on the bridge site (Fig. 2 (3b)) as

compared to the top site (Fig. 2 (3c)) by 0.06 eV. The HOMO-LUMO gap in the (3b) form

(0.66 eV) is also greater than the gap in the (3c) form (0.19 eV). The ground states of both

of these structures are doublet. The H BEs in these geometries are 2.63 eV and 2.57 eV

respectively, which are relatively small when compared to the most of the BEs in the other
PtnHm clusters. The Pt-H distance in the bridge site (1.71 ˚A, (3b)) is very similar to the

corresponding bridge site distances of the previous clusters, that is Pt-H distances in Pt2H
(2b) and Pt2H2 (2d). The same is true for the typical 1.53 ˚A Pt-H top site distance in the

(3c) form which is very close to the Pt-H distances in the (1a), (1b), (2e), and (2f) structures.
The only exception of this is the 1.56 ˚A Pt-H bond length in the (2c) form which can be

related to the fact that (2c) structure is a quartet although all the other PtnH clusters listed

above are doublets. In our calculations, we have not found any local minima of Pt3H in

which H has a coordination number of three or more.

Pt3H2: We have identiﬁed 9 diﬀerent local minima of Pt3H2; three bridge-bridge conﬁgu-

rations (Fig. 2 (3d)-(3f)), four bridge-top conﬁgurations (Fig. 2 (3g)-(3j)), and two top-top

conﬁgurations (Fig. 2 (3k), (3l)). In the (3d) geometry the two H atoms are on the same

bridge site, whereas in the (3e) and (3f) forms they are on the neighboring sites. The dif-

9

ference between (3e) and (3f) is that in the former case H atoms are on the opposite sides

of the Pt3 plane, whereas in the later case they are not. Among the four bridge-top con-

ﬁgurations, (3h) is the only one having a Pt atom bonding to both of the H atoms. In the

(3g) and (3j) geometries the bridge and top site H atoms are on the opposite and on the

same sides of the Pt3 plane, respectively. In the (3i) case, all the atoms of the cluster are

on the same plane. In one of the top-top conﬁguration, the H atoms are bonded to diﬀerent

Pt atoms (3k). They are bonded to the same Pt atom in the other one (3l). The top-top

conﬁgurations have greater BEs than all the other isomers (see Table III). When the two

H atoms are bonded to the top site of the same Pt atom (3l), the ground state is a triplet

which is diﬀerent from the singlet (2f) structure of Pt2H2. The (3l) structure has the greatest

BE and HOMO-LUMO gap, and therefore it is the most stable Pt3H2 cluster that we have
investigated in the present work. The H-H distance in it is 1.75 ˚A. The BE for 2H is 5.51

eV and it is signiﬁcantly higher than the dissociation energy of H2 (4.75 eV). Accordingly,

hydrogen is likely to be dissociated on Pt3 as well as on Pt2. Among the bridge-top conﬁgu-

rations, (3h) structure has higher BE than the others. The bridge-top isomers of the Pt3H2

cluster are generally more stable than its bridge-bridge isomers except that (3f) geometry

has greater BE than (3i).

Pt4H & Pt4H2: H prefers to bind to the ground state Pt tetramer on the top site. The

isomer with H on the top site (Fig. 2 (4c)) is a quartet and its BE is 0.3 eV greater than that

of the isomer with H on the bridge site (Fig. 2 (4b)) which is a doublet. The HOMO-LUMO

gap of (4c) is also greater than that of (4b) (see Table III). Thus, (4c) structure is expected

to be more stable. In the case of 2H, the most stable structure is a top-top conﬁguration

(Fig. 2 (4h)) which is similar to the Pt3H2 case. The HOMO-LUMO gap of this structure is

0.94 eV and it is higher than that of all the other Pt4H2 isomers. The H-H distance in (4h)
is 1.95 ˚A. The 2H BE is 5.80 eV. Thus, the H absorbtion is again dissociative. The BEs of

the neighbor bridge-bridge conﬁguration (4d) and the opposite bridge-bridge conﬁguration

(4e) are nearly the same. However, (4d) is a triplet whereas (4e) is a singlet. For the bridge-

top conﬁgurations, the neighboring structure (4f) is 0.1 eV more stable than the opposite

structure (4g).

Pt5H & Pt5H2: H can bind to the ground state Pt pentamer on three diﬀerent bridge

and two diﬀerent top sites. Top site bonding is favorable in BE: (5f) is the lowest energy

structure. However the HOMO-LUMO gaps of the bridge site bonded structures are higher

10

than those of top site bonded structures. All Pt5H isomers in Table III are in the quartet

states. For the bonding of 2H, we have identiﬁed three bridge-bridge, four bridge-top, and

three top-top locally stable conﬁgurations. In each of these 10 optimization processes, we

have started from diﬀerent H locations on the lowest energy structure (5-1) of the Pt5 cluster.

However, in three of them (5-1) conﬁguration of the 5 Pt atoms changed into some other

topologies at the end of the relaxation: The (5i) and (5p) geometries are based on trigonal

bipyramid and the (5o) resembles to rhombus pyramid.

In agreement with the general

trend, the most stable Pt5H2 isomer is the (5p) top-top structure with the highest BE and
the highest HOMO-LUMO gap. The H-H distance in (5p) is 1.91 ˚A and the 2H BE is 5.59

eV. Thus, the H absorbtion is still dissociative. While the ground state Pt5H2 cluster (5p)

and three other isomers ((5i), (5k), and (5m)) are in quintet states, the other six isomers are

in triplet states. Similar to the previous clusters, generally bridge-top conﬁgurations have

higher BEs than bridge-bridge structures.

C. Fragmentation Behavior

Figure 3 shows the plot of the BE of one and two H atoms on the lowest energy isomers

of the Pt clusters. The H BE is large for most clusters and in particular for clusters with

1 and 4 Pt atoms. This is similar when 2H BEs are considered. The clusters with 1, and

4 Pt atoms have larger BEs for 2H compared to their neighboring sizes. We have further

studied the stability of these clusters from the fragmentation channels in which a Pt atom,

or a Pt2, or PtH molecule is one of the fragments. The fragmentation energies of all of these

channels are listed in Table IV. It is noted that the fragmentation energies are the largest

for Pt4H2 in Pt and PtH fragmentation channels. Therefore, we expect it to be the most

stable species. For the Pt2 fragmentation, Pt5H2 has the highest fragmentation energy. On

the other hand, Pt2H2 and Pt3H2 have the lowest fragmentation energies for this channel.

D. Magnetic Moment of PtnHm Clusters

In this section we discuss the change in the magnetic moment of the hydrogenated plat-

inum clusters when successive H atoms are added to the bare Pt clusters. The magnetic

moments and the majority and minority spin LUMO energies of the lowest energy structures

for PtnHm (n = 1-5, m = 0-2) clusters are presented in Table V. It can be seen in Table V

that the successive H addition to Pt atom and Pt dimer reduces the magnetic moment as

in the case of H absorption in bulk Pt. However, when the successive H additions to the Pt

trimer and pentamer are considered, it is observed that as the magnetic moments decrease in

the ﬁrst additions, they increase in the second ones. For the tetramer, the magnetic moment

increases in the ﬁrst addition and decreases in the second. Thus, the magnetic moments of

certain small Pt clusters exhibit an oscillatory change in the successive addition of H atoms.

The results obtained in this study conﬁrm the explanation of Ashman et al. [4] that

this situation can be understood by looking at the LUMO energy diﬀerences between the

majority and minority spin electrons (δE = minority spin LUMO energy - majority spin

LUMO energy). When the minority spin LUMO energy is much less than the majority

spin LUMO energy (when δE is highly negative), the additional electron goes to the spin

state with lowest LUMO, and reduces the magnetic moment to decrease the cluster’s total

energy. This is what happens when successive H atoms are added to Pt atom and dimer.

However, if LUMO of minority is slightly less than LUMO of majority (if δE is greater than

a certain value which is around -0.227 eV for Pt-H clusters), the additional electron may

go to majority manifold since the exchange coupling could lead to a rearrangement of the

manifolds. This explains the increases in the magnetic moments when H atoms are added to

the Pt3H and Pt4 clusters. It should be noted here that nearly a half of the Pt3H2 isomers

in Table III are in the singlet, and the others are in the triplet states. Similarly, one of the

Pt4H isomer is in the doublet and the other is in the quartet states. For Pt5H, the δE is even

positive and therefore we expect that H addition will most probably increase the magnetic

moment. In fact, this expectation is conﬁrmed in our results since the lowest energy isomer

of the Pt5H2 is found to be in the quintet state.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have presented results of studies on the interactions in the bare and

hydrogenated platinum clusters. We ﬁnd that H interacts strongly with Pt clusters. The

interaction of H2 molecule with any of the Pt clusters studied in the present work is likely

to be dissociative. H atoms can bond to Pt clusters either on a bridge site or on a top site.

We do not ﬁnd any 3-fold bonding of H to Pt clusters. In general, a top site bonding is more

12

favorable than a bridge site bonding. Therefore, for the bonding of two H atoms, top-top

conﬁgurations are more stable than bridge-top and bridge-bridge conﬁgurations. Among

all the clusters we have investigated, we ﬁnd that Pt4H2 is the best candidate to be the

most stable one. We do not agree with a previous claim that 3D geometries of Pt tetramer

and pentamer are unfavored. We have identiﬁed a distorted tetrahedron and a bridge site

capped tetrahedron as the lowest energy structures of Pt4 and Pt5, respectively. We have

also shown that the successive addition of H atoms to Pt clusters decreases the magnetic

moments of the Pt atom and Pt dimer, whereas it leads to an oscillatory change in the

magnetic moment of Pt3 - Pt5 clusters.

Abstract. The static electric dipole polarizability of NaN clusters with even N has been calculated in a
collective, axially averaged and a three-dimensional, ﬁnite-ﬁeld approach for 2 ≤ N ≤ 20, including the
ionic structure of the clusters. The validity of a collective model for the static response of small systems
is demonstrated. Our density functional calculations verify the trends and ﬁne structure seen in a recent
experiment. A pseudopotential that reproduces the experimental bulk bond length and atomic energy levels
leads to a substantial increase in the calculated polarizabilities, in better agreement with experiment. We
relate remaining diﬀerences in the magnitude of the theoretical and experimental polarizabilities to the
ﬁnite temperature present in the experiments.

1 Introduction

The measurement of the static electric polarizability of
sodium clusters [1] and its interpretation in terms of the
jellium model [2] was one of the triggers for the research
activities that today form the ﬁeld of modern metal clus-
ter physics. The ﬁrst theoretical studies were followed by
several others with diﬀerent methods and aims: density
functional calculations using pseudopotentials [3,4] or tak-
ing all electrons into account [5] aimed at a quantitative
description of the experimentally observed eﬀects, semi-
classical approaches [6] focused on size-dependent trends,
and the static electric polarizability served to test and
compare theoretical concepts [7,8,9]. Recently, the ﬁeld
received new inspiration from a second experimental de-
termination of the static polarizability of small, uncharged
Na clusters [10].

Whereas a qualitative understanding of the experi-
ments can be obtained with relatively simple models, a
quantitative theoretical determination of the polarizabil-
ity requires knowledge of the ionic and electronic conﬁg-
urations of the clusters. Great eﬀort has been devoted in
the past to determine these [4,11,12,13]. However, taking
all ionic and electronic degrees of freedom into account
in a three-dimensional calculation is a task of consider-
able complexity. Therefore, most of these studies were re-
stricted to clusters with not more than nine atoms. To
reduce the computational expense, approximations for in-
cluding ionic eﬀects were developed [14,15,16,17,18,19].
A second problem, however, is the great number of close-
lying isomers that are found in sodium clusters. This eﬀect
is especially pronounced when stabilization of an overall

shape through electronic shell eﬀects is weak, i.e. for the
“soft” clusters that are found between ﬁlled shells. In the
present work we present calculations for the static electric
polarizability that include the ionic structure in a realistic
way. We take into account a great number of isomers for
clusters with up to 20 atoms, especially for the soft clusters
that ﬁll the second electronic shell. The theoretical con-
cepts that we used in this study are introduced in section
2, where we also discuss the relevant cluster structures. In
section 3 we present our results and compare with other
calculations and experimental work. Our conclusions are
summarized in section 4.

2 Theoretical concepts

The starting point for the theoretical determination of the
polarizability of a cluster is the calculation of the ionic and
electronic conﬁguration of the ground-state and close ly-
ing isomers. In the present work, this was done in two
steps. First, we calculated low-energy ionic geometries for
a wide range of cluster sizes with an improved version [19]
of the “Cylindrically Averaged Pseudopotential Scheme”
(CAPS) [18]. In CAPS the ions are treated fully three-
dimensionally, but the valence electrons are restricted to
axial symmetry. The cluster ground state is found by si-
multaneously minimizing the energy functional with re-
spect to the set of ionic positions (simulated annealing)
and the valence-electron density. For the exchange and
correlation energy we used the local-density approxima-
tion (LDA) functional of Perdew and Wang [20], and for
the pseudopotential we employed the recently developed

2

phenomenological smooth-core potential that reproduces
low temperature bulk and atomic properties [19]. Detailed
comparisons with ab initio calculations have shown [19]
that CAPS predicts ionic geometries of sodium clusters
rather accurately since truly triaxial deformations are rare.
Furthermore, in a second step we performed fully three-
dimensional (3D) Kohn-Sham (KS) calculations to check
the ordering of isomers and to calculate polarizabilities
without axial restriction on the electrons, and also in-
cluded conﬁgurations from 3D geometry optimizations into
our analysis as discussed below.

Fig. 1 schematically depicts the most important ionic
geometries for neutral clusters with even electron num-
bers between 2 and 20. (We have calculated the polariz-
abilities also for many further and higher isomers which,
however, are not shown in Fig. 1 for the sake of clarity.
They were omitted from the discussion since they do not
lead to qualitatively diﬀerent results.) For the small clus-

ters Na2, Na4 and Na6, many other theoretical predictions
have been made [3,4,10,12,13], and our geometries are in
perfect agreement with them. In addition, due to the con-
struction of the pseudopotential [19], the bond lengths are
close to the experimental ones, as e.g. seen in the dimer,
where our calculated bond length is 5.78a0 and the exper-
imental one [21] is 5.82a0. For Na8 and Na10, our results
are in agreement with 3D density functional calculations
[3,4,13]. For Na12, we do not now of any ab initio calcu-
lations. Therefore, besides two low-energy conﬁgurations
from CAPS [(a) and (b)], we also included a locally re-
optimized low-energy geometry from a 3D, H¨uckel model
calculation [15] in our analysis (c). Our 3D calculations
conﬁrm our CAPS results and ﬁnd structures (a) and (b)
quasi degenerate with a diﬀerence in total energy of 0.05
eV, whereas structure (c) is higher by 0.4 eV. Two of the
three geometries considered for Na14 [(b) and (c)] were
also found very similar in 3D H¨uckel model calculations
[15,17], and both CAPS and the 3D KS calculations ﬁnd
all of them very close in energy. For Na16, we ﬁnd as the
CAPS-ground state structure (a), and in our 3D calcula-
tions structure (b) is quasi degenerate with (a), whereas
structures (c) and (d) are higher by 0.08 eV and 0.5 eV.
Due to their very diﬀerent overall shapes, these isomers
span a range of what can be expected for the polarizabil-
ity. For Na18 and Na20, our structures are again in close
agreement with the 3D density functional calculation of
[13], and all three structures are quasi degenerate.

The static electric polarizability was calculated in two
diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst is based on a collective description
of electronic excitations. It uses the well known equality

α = 2m−1,

to the static electric polarizability α in the direction spec-
iﬁed by the external (dipole) excitation operator Q.

In the evaluation of the strength function, the excited
states |νi are identiﬁed with collective excitations. A dis-
cussion of this approach can be found in [22]. The collec-
tive calculations were carried out using the cylindrically
averaged densities and the “clamped nuclei approxima-
tion” [4], i.e. the ionic positions were taken to be the same
with and without the dipole ﬁeld. We have also checked
this widely used approximation in the context of our stud-
ies and ﬁnd it well justiﬁed, as discussed below.

The static polarizability can also be calculated directly
from the derivative of the induced dipole moment µ in the
presence of an external electric dipole ﬁeld F (“ﬁnite ﬁeld
method”):

for ions with valence Z. Here one has to make sure that the
numerically applied ﬁnite dipole ﬁeld F is small enough
to be in the regime of linear response, but that it is on
the other hand large enough to give a numerically stable
signal. We have carefully checked this and found that the
2
2 and 0.0005e/a0
used ﬁeld strengths between 0.00001e/a0
meet both requirements. Applied to the axial calculations,
this approach allows to obtain the polarizability in the z-
direction. By employing this method with the 3D KS cal-
culations we have checked the inﬂuences of the axial av-
eraging and the collective model on the polarizability and
found that the z-polarizabilities from the axial and the
3D ﬁnite-ﬁeld calculations agree within 1% on the aver-
age for the low-energy isomers. This shows that the axial
averaging is a good approximation for the clusters dis-
cussed here. The performance of the collective model will
be discussed below in Section 3.1. The orientation of our
coordinate system was chosen such that the z-axis is in
that principal direction of the tensor of inertia in which it
deviates most from its average value. The average static
electric polarizability

length (together with the compressibility and the atomic
3s-level) when used with the LDA, and correspondingly
results in a higher polarizability, in better agreement with
experiment. It is further interesting to note that also the
polarizabilities calculated with the empirical Bardsley po-
tential [3], which was constructed to reproduce atomic
energy levels, are noticeably higher than the BHS-based
values. This shows that the cluster polarizability is also
sensitive to atomic energy levels, and the fact that our
values are closest to the experiment thus is a natural con-
sequence of the combination of correct atomic energy lev-
els and bond lengths.

3 Results

3.1 Comparison of diﬀerent theoretical results

Since all density functional calculations that we know of
agree on the geometry of the smallest sodium clusters,
these clusters can serve as test cases to compare diﬀer-
ent theoretical approaches. In Table 1 we have listed the
averaged static dipole polarizability as obtained in dif-
ferent calculations, together with the value obtained in
the recent experiment of Rayane et al. [10]. All calcula-
tions reproduce the experimental trend and give the cor-
rect overall magnitude. But also, all calculations under-
estimate the polarizability. The magnitude of this under-
estimation, however, varies considerably for the diﬀerent
approaches. Whereas our results are closest to the exper-
iment and close to the theoretical ones of Ref. [10], with
the largest diﬀerence to the experiment being 8 % for Na8,
a diﬀerence of 27 % is found for this cluster in the calcu-
lation based on the ab initio Bachelet, Hamann, Schl¨uter
(BHS) Pseudopotential [4]. A good part of this diﬀerence
can be explained by comparing the bond lenghts of the
clusters. The BHS pseudopotential considerably underes-
timates the bond lengths [4], leading to a higher electron
density and a lower polarizability. Our empirical smooth-
core pseudopotential, on the other hand, was constructed
to reproduce the experimental low-temperature bulk bond

From comparison with the calculations that went be-
yond the LDA [5,10], it however becomes clear that the
empirical pseudopotentials by construction ”compensate”
some of the errors that are a consequence of the use of the
LDA. Therefore, it would be dangerous to argue that the
inclusion of gradient corrections, which have been shown
to increase the polarizability, could bring our calculated
values in agreement with experiment: going beyond the
LDA but keeping the empirical LDA pseudopotentials could
lead to a double counting of eﬀects. We therefore conclude
that, on the one hand, a considerable part of the earlier
observed diﬀerences between theoretical and experimen-
tal polarizabilities can be attributed to eﬀects associated
with errors in the bond lengths or atomic energy levels,
but on the other hand, further eﬀects must contribute to
the underestimation with respect to experiment. We will
come back to this second point below.

In Table 2 we have listed the polarizabilities of Na2 to
Na20 for the geometries shown in Fig. 1. The left half gives
the polarizability as computed from the 3D electron den-
sity with the ﬁnite-ﬁeld method, and the right half lists
the values obtained in the axially averaged collective ap-
proach. For the clusters up to Na8, the two methods agree
well and the diﬀerences for the averaged polarizabilities
are less than 1% for Na2 and Na8, and 3% for Na4 and
Na6. This shows that the collective description is rather
accurate, which is remarkable if one recalls that we are

4

dealing with only very few electrons. Beyond Na8, the dif-
ferences are 6 % on the average, which is still fair, but ob-
viously higher. This looks counter-intuitive at ﬁrst sight,
because the collective description should become better
for larger systems. However, for N > 8 there comes an
increasing number of particle-hole states close to the Mie
plasmon resonance [22], leading to increasing fragmenta-
tion of the collective strength. m−1 and thus α is sensitive
to energetically low-lying excitations since their energies
enter in the denominator in Eq. 2, and this can lead to an
underestimation of the polarizability.

Comparing the polarizabilities of clusters with the same
number of electrons but diﬀerent geometries shows the in-
ﬂuence of the overall shape of the cluster. For Na14, e.g.,
isomers (a) and (c) have a valence electron density which
is close to prolate, whereas (b) has a more oblate one. The
averaged polarizability for the two prolate isomers is equal,
although their ionic geometries diﬀer. The oblate isomer,
however, has a noticeably higher averaged polarizability.
This is what one expects, because for oblate clusters there
are two principal directions with a low and one with a high
polarizability, whereas for prolate clusters the reverse is
true. The fact that diﬀerent ionic geometries can lead to
very similar averaged polarizabilities is also seen for Na12.
It thus becomes clear that contrary to what was believed
earlier [3] one cannot necessarily distinguish between de-
tails in the ionic conﬁguration by comparing theoretical
values to experimental data that measure the averaged
polarizability.

3.2 Comparison with experiments

Fig. 2 shows ¯α for our ground state structures as obtained
in the axial, collective approach and the 3D ﬁnite-ﬁeld
calculations, in comparison to the two available sets of ex-
perimental data. The absolute values for the experiments
were calculated from the measured relative values with
3
an atomic polarizability of 23.6˚A
[10]. To guide the eye,
the polarizabilities from each set of data are connected
by lines. Both experiments and the theoretical data show
that, overall, the polarizability increases with increasing
cluster size. The polarizability from the axial collective
model qualitatively shows the same behavior as the one
from the 3D ﬁnite ﬁeld calculation. Comparison of the

mer; ﬁlled squares with short dashed line: present work, axially

discussion of error bars.

3D values with the experimental data shows that for the
smallest clusters, the theoretical and experimental values
agree as discussed before, and the values obtained in the
two experiments are comparable up to Na10. Beyond Na10,
the discrepancies between the two experiments become
larger, and also the diﬀerences between theoretical and ex-
perimental polarizabilities increase. For Na12, Na14, Na16
and Na18 the experiment of Knight et al. gives lower values
than the experiment of Rayane et al., and the calculated
averaged polarizability is lower than both experiments for
Na12, Na14, and Na16. For Na18 the ﬁnite-ﬁeld value ob-
tained for our ground-state structure matches the value
measured by Knight el al., and for Na20, our ground-state
polarizability is very close to the measurement of Rayane
et al. In this discussion one must keep in mind, however,
that the experimental uncertainty is about +/-2 ˚A
per
atom [10], i.e. the uncertainty in the absolute value in-
creases with the cluster size, as indicated by the errors
bars in Fig. 2. Comparisons are made easier if the linear

look at the normalized polarizability

which is shown in Fig. 3, because it allows to identify
trends and details more clearly.

From Fig. 3 it becomes clear that for Na2 to Na8, the
trend seen in the two experiments is similar up to one
exception: For Na6, the experiment of Rayane et al. pre-
dicts a noticeably smaller value than the one by Knight
et al. Comparison with our theoretical data shows that,
although the values of the older experiment are closer to
the theory with respect to magnitude for Na2, Na4 and
Na8, the trend that our data show corresponds clearly to
the one seen in the new experiment since the two curves
are parallel. Going from Na8 to Na10, both experiments
predict a steep rise in the polarizability. This rise due to
the shell closing at Na8 is also seen in the theoretical data,
but it is less pronounced than in the experiments (as we
will discuss below). For Na12, a higher ¯αn than for Na10
is predicted by the data of Rayane, whereas the reverse
ordering is seen in the data of Knight et al. Again, our
calculations support the ﬁnding of the new experiment,
and all isomers lead to similar ¯αn. For Na14, both experi-
ments show a decrease. Our prolate ground state and iso-
mer reproduce this trend. That it is the prolate structures
that ﬁt to the experiment is consistent with the ab initio
molecular dynamics calculations of H¨akkinen et al. [23].
The next step to Na16 again reveals a slight diﬀerence
between the two experiments: both predict an increase
compared to Na14, but whereas the older experiment sees
¯αn smaller for Na16 than for Na12, the new experiment
shows the opposite ordering. Once more, our ground state

structure leads to a polarizability that follows the trend of
the new experiment. (The other isomers, however, lead to
smaller polarizabilities, and an explanation for the diﬀer-
ence between the experiments thus might be that diﬀerent
ensembles of isomers were populated due to slightly dif-
ferent experimental conditions.) Going to Na18 leads to
a decrease in the polarizability in both experiments. Our
calculation shows this decrease, which is a manifestation of
the nearby shell closing. But whereas the old experiment
actually sees the shell closing at Na18 and an increase in
the polarizability for Na20, the new experiment and our
data ﬁnd an absolute minimum at Na20.

A comparison with the polarizability obtained in the
spherical jellium model [2,8] for Na8 and Na20, also indi-
cated in Fig. 3, shows the improvement that is brought
about by the inclusion of the ionic structure.

3.3 Discussion

As just discussed, our calculations reproduce the ﬁne struc-
ture seen in the new experiment. However, there is no
obvious explanation for why the results of the two exper-
iments diﬀer [24]. Also, there is a characteristic change
in the magnitude of the diﬀerence between our theoreti-
cal results and the experimental values of Rayane et al.:
whereas the calculated values for Na2 to Na8 and Na20 on
the average diﬀer only by 5 % from the new experiment,
the open-shell clusters from Na10 to Na18 show 18 % dif-
ference for the ground state. The increase in polarizability
when going from Na8 to Na10 is considerably underesti-
mated, whereas the following steps in the normalized po-
larizability are nearly reproduced correctly, i.e. it looks as
if the theoretical curve for Na10 to Na18 should be shifted
upwards by a constant. A ﬁrst suspicion might be that this
“oﬀset” could be due to the use of CAPS in the geometry
optimization. But it should be noted that the step occurs
at Na10, and that also Na14 and Na18 are oﬀ by the same
amount. Since the low-energy structures of these clusters
are well established, as discussed in Section 2, and since
also the geometry for Na12 from the 3D calculation does
not lead to qualitatively diﬀerent results, we can conclude
that the diﬀerences are not due to limits in the geometry
optimization with CAPS. Also, the neglection of the re-
laxation of the nuclei in the presence of the electric dipole
ﬁeld has been investigated earlier [4] for the small clus-
ters and was shown to be a good approximation. We have
counter checked this result for the test case Na10 and ﬁnd
corrections of less than 1%.

An obvious limitation of our approach is the neglect
of the core polarization. However, the all-electron calcu-
lations of Guan et al. [5] treat the core electrons explic-
itly and do not lead to better agreement with experiment,
as discussed in Section 3.1. From this, one already can
conclude that core polarization cannot account for all of
the observed diﬀerences. Its eﬀect can be estimated from
the polarizability of the sodium cation. Diﬀerent measure-
3
ments [25] ﬁnd values between 0.179 ˚A
, lead-
ing to corrections of - roughly - 1-2 % in ¯αn. Since the core
polarizability leads to a shift in ¯αn that is the same for all

3
and 0.41 ˚A

cluster sizes, it contributes to the diﬀerence that is also
seen for the smallest clusters, but it cannot explain the
jump in the diﬀerence seen at Na10.

Another principal limitation of our approach is the use
of the LDA. As, e.g., discussed in [5], the LDA can af-
fect the polarizability in diﬀerent and opposing ways. On
the one hand it may lead to an overscreening and thus
an underestimation of the polarizability, and early calcu-
lations within the spherical jellium model reported that
indeed the static polarizability was increased if one went
beyond LDA using self-interaction corrections [7]. On the
other hand, self-interaction corrections can lead to more
negative single particle energies and thus to smaller polar-
izabilities [5], and Refs. [8] and [26] give examples where
the overall eﬀect of self-interaction corrections on the op-
tic response is very small. One cannot directly conclude
from the jellium results to our ionic structure calculations,
because the sharp edge of the steep-wall jellium model can
qualitatively lead to diﬀerences. But in any case it is highly
implausible that the LDA aﬀects the clusters from Na10
to Na18 much stronger than the other ones, and it should
also be kept in mind that the worst indirect eﬀects of the
LDA as, e.g., underestimation of bond lengths, are com-
pensated by using our phenomenological pseudopotential.
One might also ponder about possible uncertainties in
the experimental determination of the polarizabilities. A
considerable underestimation could be explained if one as-
sumes that while passing through the deﬂecting ﬁeld, the
clusters are oriented such that one always measures the
highest component of the polarizability. In that case, we
would not have to compare the averaged value to the ex-
periment, but the highest one. One could imagine that
the cluster’s rotation be damped, since angular momen-
tum conservation is broken by the external ﬁeld and the
energy thus could be transferred from the rotation to in-
ternal degrees of freedom (vibrations). The time scale of
this energy transfer is not known, but since the clusters
are spending about 10−4s in the deﬂecting ﬁeld region, it
seems unlikely that there should be no coupling over such
a long time. One could further argue that for statistical
reasons it is less likely that a larger cluster will lose its
orientation again through random-like thermal motion of
its constituent ions than a smaller cluster. However, the
maximal energy diﬀerence between diﬀerent orientations
is very small, for Na10, e.g., it is 0.3K kB for the typical
ﬁeld strength applied in the experiment [1]. Thus, thermal
ﬂuctuations can be expected to wipe out any orientation.
From another point of view, however, the ﬁnite tem-
perature explains a good part of the diﬀerences that our
calculations (and other calculations for the small clusters)
show in comparison to the experimental data. Whereas
our calculations were done for T=0, the supersonic nozzle
expansion used in the experiment produces clusters with
an internal energy distribution corresponding to about 400
- 600 K [27,28]. An estimate based on the thermal ex-
pansion coeﬃcient of bulk sodium leads to an increase
in the bond lengths of about 3 %, and a detailed ﬁnite-
temperature CAPS calculation [29] for Na+
11 at 400 K also
shows a bond length increase of 3 %. This will only be a

lower limit, since in neutral clusters one can expect a larger
expansion than in the bulk due to the large surface, and
also a larger expansion than for charged clusters. Thus, to
get an estimate for the lower limit of what can be expected
from thermal expansion, we have scaled the cluster coor-
dinates by 3 % and again calculated the polarizabilities,
ﬁnding an increase of about 3 % for the planar and 5 %
for three-dimensional structures. This ﬁnding is consistent
with the results of Guan et al. Together with the correc-
tions that are to be expected from the core polarizability,
this brings our results for the small and the closed shell
clusters in quantitative agreement with the experimental
data.

4 Summary and Conclusion

We have presented calculations for the static electric dipole
polarizability for sodium clusters with atom numbers be-
tween 2 and 20, covering several low-energy structures
for each cluster size beyond Na10. By comparing our re-
sults to previous calculations for the smallest clusters, we
have shown that a pseudopotential which correctly repro-
duces atomic and bulk properties also improves the static
response considerably. We have shown that a collective
model for the excited states of sodium clusters, whose va-
lidity for the dynamical response was established previ-
ously, works reasonably also for the static response in real-
istic systems. Over the whole range of cluster sizes studied
in the present work, we conﬁrm the ﬁne structure seen in a
recent experiment. By comparing the calculated averaged
polarizability of diﬀerent isomers for the same cluster size
to the measured polarizability, we showed that completely
diﬀerent ionic geometries can lead to very similar averaged
polarizabilities. By considering higher isomers we further-
more took a ﬁrst step to take into account the ﬁnite tem-
perature present in the experiment. Our results show that
for the open shell clusters from Na10 to Na18, also higher
lying isomers do not close the remaining gap between the-
ory and experiment. This shows that it is a worthwhile
task for future studies to investigate the inﬂuence of ﬁnite
temperatures on these “soft” clusters explicitly. For Na2
to Na8 and Na20, we showed that quantitative agreement
is already obtained when the eﬀects of thermal expansion
and the core polarizability are taken into account.

One of us (S. K¨ummel) thanks K. Hansen for several clar-
ifying discussions concerning the experimental temperatures
and time-scales, especially with respect to the “orientation
question”, and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for ﬁnan-
cial support.

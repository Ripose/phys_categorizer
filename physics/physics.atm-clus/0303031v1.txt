The mean-square radii of the molecules 4He3, 4He2−6Li, 4He2−7Li and 4He2−23Na are calcu-
lated using a three-body model with contact interactions. They are obtained from a universal
scaling function calculated within a renormalized scheme for three particles interacting through
pairwise Dirac-delta interaction. The root-mean-square distance between two atoms of mass mA
¯h2/[mA(E3 − E2)], where E2 is the
in a triatomic molecule are estimated to be of de order of C
dimer and E3 the trimer binding energies, and C is a constant (varying from ∼ 0.6 to ∼ 1) that
depends on the ratio between E2 and E3. Considering previous estimatives for the trimer energies,
we also predict the sizes of Rubidium and Sodium trimers in atomic traps.

INTRODUCTION

Weakly bound molecules are large size quantum sys-
tems in which the atoms have an appreciable probabil-
ity to be found much beyond the interaction range, and
at the same time tiny changes in the potential parame-
ters can produce huge eﬀects in the properties of these
states[1]. The best illustration of such systems is the ex-
4 ˚A
perimentally found 4He2 dimer[2], with
and binding energy E2=1.1 + 0.3/ - 0.2 mK[3]. Other
examples of weakly bound molecules are found through
the experimental realization of Bose-Einstein condensa-
tion (BEC) [4], where the possibility to change the ef-
fective scattering length of the low-energy atom-atom in-
teraction in the trap to large positive values by using
an external magnetic ﬁeld [4, 5] can produce very large
dimers.
In fact, weakly bound molecules in ultracold
atomic traps were reported in Ref. [6]. The binding en-
ergy of the 87Rb2 dimer formed in a Bose-Einstein con-
densate was measured with unprecedented accuracy [7].
Ultracold Na2 molecules have also been formed through
photo-association [8]. One should note that in limit of
an inﬁnite atom-atom scattering length tuned by Fes-
hbach resonances in the trap, in principle the Eﬁmov
condition[9] can be achieved, in which an inﬁnite number
of weakly-bound trimers exist. The formation of weakly
bound trimers in ultracold atomic systems have not been
reported till now, but recently the recombination coef-
ﬁcient rate was used to predict trimer binding energies
of some speciﬁc atomic species that are being studied in
atomic traps [10].

Theoretically it is possible to exist weakly bound
molecules of zero-angular momentum states in triatomic
systems, as for example, in the extensively studied 4He

[11] and therein). These
trimer system (see, e.g. Ref.
molecules are special due to the large spatial size which
spreads out much beyond the potential range[11, 12].
In such trimer, the calculations of the mean-square dis-
tance of each 4He atom to the corresponding center-of-
mass have been performed for the ground and excited
states [11, 12], and also for the mean-square interatomic
distance [11]. These sizes are of de order of 5 to 10 ˚A
for the ground state of the 4He3 molecule, and of about
50 to 90 ˚A for the excited Eﬁmov state [11]. Therefore,
the system heals through regions that are well outside
of the potential range, in which the wavefunction is es-
sentially a solution of the free Schr¨odinger equation, and
where the physical properties of the bound system is de-
ﬁned by few physical scales. For example, the dimen-
sionless product of the mean-square interatom distance
with the separation energy of one atom from the trimer
is not far from the unity [11] in the ground and also in
the excited state, despite of the large diﬀerence between
such energies E(0)
is the binding en-
ergy of the n-th trimer state). So, as already discussed
in Refs. [13, 14, 15, 16], we should note that quite natu-
rally the binding energy is the scale that dominates the
physics of the trimer. One should remember as well that
the collapse of the three-body system in the limit of a
zero-range force[17] makes the three-body energy one of
the scales of the system, beyond the two-body energy[13].

The calculation of the low-energy properties of the
three-body system can be performed with a renormal-
ization scheme applied to three-body equations with

about the short-range force, beyond the low-energy two-
body observables, are retained in only one three-body
physical information in the limit of zero-range interac-
tion.

In the present work, we ﬁrst study the mean-square
distances of one atom to the center-of-mass (CM) sys-
tem and between two atoms in the ground and excited
states of triatomic molecules of the type 4He2−
X, where
4He, 6Li, 7Li and 23Na. Next, using trimer ener-

gies derived from the recombination coeﬃcient rates [10],
we estimate the corresponding sizes of Rubidium and
Sodium trimers. We introduce and calculate scaling func-
tions that describe the diﬀerent radii as functions of the
physical scales of the triatomic system obtained in the
limit of a zero-range interaction. In this way, we are gen-
eralizing the concept of scaling function, that was pre-
viously introduced in Refs. [15] and [18] to study the
behavior of bound and excited virtual Eﬁmov states [9]
in terms of triatomic physical scales.

The scaling function depends only on dimensionless
ratios of the binding energies of two and three atoms,
and the ratio of masses of the diﬀerent atoms. In that
sense our conclusions apply equally well to any other low-
energy triatomic system.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section II, we
present the Faddeev equations for the spectator functions
for the ααβ triatomic system, and the form factors from
which the diﬀerent mean-square radii are obtained. Also
in this section we discuss the generalization of the scaling
function deﬁned in Refs. [15, 18] to describe the diﬀerent
radii. In section III, we present our numerical results for
the mean-square distances of one atom in respect to the
CM system and between two atoms in the ground and
excited states of triatomic molecules. Our conclusions
are summarized in section IV.

II. RENORMALIZED THREE-BODY MODEL
AND FORM FACTORS

In this section, we introduce the generalization of the
scaling function deﬁned in Refs. [15] and [18], to be used
to obtain the diﬀerent radii. We write down the cou-
pled renormalized equations for the spectator functions
and the expressions for the form factors which allow the
calculation of the diﬀerent mean-square distances.

The mass number A is given by the ratio mβ/mα. The
plus and minus signs in (3) and (4) refer to virtual
and bound two-body subsystems, respectively. We solve
Eqs. (1 -6) in units such that the three-body subtrac-
tion point is µ(3) = 1[18]. The corresponding dimen-
sionless quantities are: ǫ3 ≡
(3),
ǫαβ ≡
(3). The three-body physical quantities can
be written in terms of the three-body binding energy E3
when ﬁrst the value of µ2
(3) is determined from the known
value of E3. Therefore, the results for the renormalized
model appear when the subtraction point energy is writ-
ten as a function of E3 and consequently the three-body
quantities naturally scale with E3. Finally, the scaling
functions are obtained when the dimensionless product
of physical quantities are written as a function of the
ratios between two-body energies and E3.

III. RESULTS FOR TRIATOMIC RADII

A. Scaling Plots

Our analysis has considered some particular three-
body molecular systems, in which the three-body ground-
state energy and the corresponding energies of the two-
body subsystem is known theoretically for 4He trimer[11],
23Na [20]. In Ref. [11],
4He2−
the authors have considered realistic two-body interac-
tions; their results for the ground and excited states radii
are appropriate for our purpose of comparing with the
present scaling approach.

7Li and 4He2−

6Li, 4He2−

The ground and excited Eﬁmov state energies of the
4He3 molecule were extensively studied in the scaling ap-
proach of Refs.
[15, 18] with results that are in very
good agreement with realistic calculations. This lead us
to conclude that other details (beyond the dimer and
trimer ground-state energies) presented in the realistic
interactions, that have been used, are quite irrelevant
to the existence of Eﬁmov states. These features val-
idates a universal scaling function, relating the trimer
ground-state, the dimer and the weakly bound excited
three-body energy state. Realistic calculations for the
excited states of 4He trimer approaches reasonably well
the scaling limit[15, 18], which suggests to investigate the
scaling limit of other observables like the diﬀerent radii
deﬁned in Eqs. (14) and (16). The conditions for the va-
lidity of the present approach are that the atoms should

have a very shallow and short-ranged two-body interac-
tion and the binding energy close to zero, i.e., the ratio
between the interaction range and dimer size should be
much smaller than 1. These are indeed the cases we are
considering.

with the realistic result. However, for the ground state
p
the results show a deviation of about 20%. The excited
state size is about ten times larger than the correspond-
ing size of the ground state. Therefore, the scaling limit
is better approached in the excited state, which is much
larger than the interaction range, which is not strictly
valid for the ground state, and consequently deviations
in the scaling plot are stronger for this state.

interest is the analysis of possible formation of molecular
systems in experiments with ultracold trapped gases. By
considering, for example, the estimatives of trimer ener-

6.4˚A of Ref. [11]. The quality of the reproduction of the
p
realistic results by our calculations are quite surprising
in view of the simplicity of the present approach, where
the only physical inputs are the values of the dimer and
trimer binding energies. The several diﬀerent radii of the
molecules 4He2-6Li, 4He2-7Li and 4He2-23Na have values
larger than those found in the 4He3 which makes plausi-
ble that our predictions are even better in quality.

We point out that the results in Table I, for the 4He
dimer sizes inside the molecules shrink in respect to the
free value of 52˚A, due to the large values of the trimer
binding energies. Qualitatively this is explained just by
considering that the dimer size scales roughly with the
inverse of the square-root of its binding energy inside

from each atom to the center-of-mass of the correspond-
ing trimer. From Fig. 1, one can also obtain the corre-
sponding mean-square distance between the atoms. We
observe that one value of the recombination rate is con-
sistent with two values of the most weakly bound trimer
energy, as discussed in Ref. [10]. Therefore, we present
two possible values for the radii that are consistent with
the corresponding weakly bound trimer energies. Actu-
ally, it is interesting to point out that, in a trap, one
can achieve dimer and trimer molecules with very large
sizes, following the possibility to alter the corresponding
two-body scattering length [5].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The mean-square radii of the triatomic molecules,
4He3, 4He2-6Li, 4He2-7Li and 4He2-23Na are calculated
using a renormalized three-body model with a pairwise
Dirac-delta interaction, having as physical inputs only
the values of the binding energies of the diatomic and
triatomic molecules. The validity of the present frame-
work is substantiated by the agreement of our results for
the diﬀerent radii with the realistic potential model cal-
culations of Ref.[11] for 4He3 ground and excited states
which are within about 14%. These results are quite sur-
prising in view of the simplicity of the present approach,
where the only physical inputs are the values of diatomic
and triatomic binding energies. Finally, we predicted for
the ﬁrst time, as far we know, the values of several diﬀer-
ent radii for 4He2-6Li, 4He2-7Li and 4He2-23Na molecules,
from the theoretical values of the binding energies calcu-
lated in Ref. [20]. These other molecules are in general
larger than the 4He-trimer indicating that our radii pre-

dictions for these triatomic ground states can be even
better in quality than those found for 4He3.

In view of the actual relevance of ultracold atomic sys-
tems that are being experimentally studied, and the pos-
sibility to observe the formation of molecular systems in
trapped condensates, we also present results for the sizes
of rubidium and sodium trimers, considering the binding

energies that were recently estimated [10] from analysis of
the corresponding three-body recombination coeﬃcients.

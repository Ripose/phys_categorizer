We present ab initio perturbed ion calculations on the structures and relative stabilities of doubly
charged ((NaCl)m(Na)2)2+ ions. The obtained stabilities show excellent agreement with exper-
imental abundances obtained from mass spectra. Those enhanced stabilities are found to be a
consequence of highly compact structures that can be built only for certain values of m. Nearly all
magic number clusters can be shown to be constructed in one of the two following ways: (a) by
adding tri- or penta-atomic chains to two edges of a perfect neutral (NaCl)n cuboid, with n=m-2 or
n=m-4, respectively; (b) by removing a chloride anion from a perfect singly charged (NaCl)nNa+
cuboid, with n=m+1.

I. INTRODUCTION

Small alkali halide clusters have attracted in the last
years the interest of both experimentalists and theo-
reticians because their simple ioniclike bonding char-
acteristics make them very easy to produce in pure
form and also easily amenable to theoretical modelling.
They are ideal candidates, for example, to study the
behavior of solvated excess electrons and the insula-
tor to metal transition upon alkali enrichment in ﬁ-
nite systems.1–12 Structural isomerizations induced by
a temperature increase,13,14 as well as the ﬁnite sys-
tem analogues of the bulk melting,15–17 freezing,18,19 and
glass20 transitions have also been studied. Apart from
it has been shown that natu-
their inherent interest,
ral alkali halide clusters at the marine atmosphere can
be partially responsible for catalytic ozone depletion.21
All of these interesting properties of alkali halide clus-
ters largely depend on the speciﬁc structures adopted by
them. Thus, a precise knowledge of the cluster struc-
tures is of paramount importance. Very recently, exper-
imental techniques like electron diﬀraction from trapped
clusters22 or measurements of cluster mobilities23–25 have
been succesfully applied to study the structures of ionic
clusters, and photoelectron spectroscopy has also been
applied to study isomerization transitions in small alkali
halide clusters.26 At the moment, however, these tech-
niques need parallel theoretical calculations to make a
deﬁnite assignment of the observed diﬀraction pattern,
mobility or ionization potential to a speciﬁc isomer ge-
ometry.

The work on alkali halide clusters has been centered
mostly in the singly charged clusters (AX)nA+ and in
the neutral clusters (AX)n, where A is an alkali cation
and X a halide anion. The abundance patterns obtained
from the mass spectra of singly charged alkali halide clus-
ter ions27,28 point towards a prompt establishment of
bulk rock-salt symmetry. Theoretical calculations have
been able to rationalize the structures adopted by neu-

tral stoichiometric clusters in terms of cation/anion size
ratios.29,30 These studies show that small sodium iodide
and lithium halide neutral clusters adopt ground state
structures based on the stacking of hexagonal rings, while
the rest of the materials adopt rocksalt-like ground state
structures. Theoretical calculations on the singly charged
cluster ions are also available,31 and they conform to
the experimental expectations of bulk rocksalt symmetry
even for those elements that crystallize in the CsCl-type
structure, namely CsCl, CsBr, and CsI. The emergence
with increasing size of bulk CsCl structure in (CsCl)nCs+
cluster ions has been recently considered.32

The structural problem in neutral and singly charged
alkali halide clusters can thus be considered well under-
stood. Work on doubly charged [(AX)m(A2)]2+ cluster
ions has been much more scarce, probably due to the in-
herent instability produced by the two excess charges.
Sattler et al.33 published mass spectra of sodium io-
dide clusters, and deduced a critical size for stability of
the doubly charged series of m=18.
In the next year,
Martin34 reported pair potential model calculations on
the structures adopted by doubly charged sodium chlo-
ride clusters, in an attempt to explain the experimen-
tal ﬁndings. He found that all the cluster sizes had
at least one metastable bound state, even though for
m <8 the removal of an Na+ cation was an exother-
mic reaction. Li and Whetten35 showed that there are
important kinetic eﬀects inﬂuencing the critical size de-
duced by Sattler et al, and found that it is possible to
populate the metastable minima for sizes smaller than
that critical size by using a less aggresive ionization
technique.
In that way they were able to ﬁnd a “sta-
bility island” in the size region m=11–12. More re-
cently, Kolmakov et al.36 have been able to observe such
small clusters as Cs5I2+
3 by embedding the alkali halide
clusters inside a rare gas coating that serves to dissi-
pate the vibrational energy excess adquired after ion-
ization. Finally, Zhang and Cooks37 have published
very recently mass spectra of free [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ clus-

1

ter ions in the size range m=11–62 by using electro-
spray ionization, and found magic numbers for the sizes
m=11,12,17,20,21,26,30,34,36,44,54, and 61. They also
report collision induced fragmentation spectra for those
magic sizes, from which a speciﬁc structural assignment
is suggested. We would also like to mention here the
closely related case of metal oxide clusters, where only
one excess cation is needed to produce doubly charged
isomers. Magnesium and calcium oxide doubly charged
cluster ions have been studied both experimentally38–40
and theoretically.41,42

To reach the same understanding level for the dou-
bly charged clusters as that already achieved for the
singly charged ones, we present in this work the re-
sults of an extensive and systematic theoretical study of
[(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ cluster ions with m ranging from 6 to
28. The experimental results by Zhang and Cooks37 con-
cerning enhanced stabilities will serve as an ideal check
of the theoretical calculations. We will show that we can
reproduce all of their magic numbers, although we also
obtain some magic numbers not found in the experimen-
tal mass spectra. The structural assignment suggested by
these authors is also examined and shown to be partially
correct. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in
Section II we give just a brief resume of the theoretical
model employed, as full an exposition has been reported
already in previous works29 and does not deserve in our
opinion the use of more journal space. The results are
presented in Section III, and the main conclusions to be
extracted from our study in Section IV.

II. THE AIPI MODEL. BRIEF LOCATION
RESUME

The ab initio Perturbed Ion (aiPI) model provides a
computational framework ideally suited to deal with ionic
systems, and its performance has been well tested both in
the crystal43–46 and cluster29–32,41,42,47 limits. The the-
oretical foundation of the aiPI model48 lies in the theory
of electronic separability.49,50 Very brieﬂy, the HF equa-
tions of the cluster are solved stepwise, by breaking the
cluster wave function into local group functions (ionic in
nature in our case). In each iteration, the total energy is
minimized with respect to variations of the electron den-
sity localized in a given ion, with the electron densities
of the other ions kept frozen. In the subsequent itera-
tions each frozen ion assumes the role of nonfrozen ion.
When the self-consistent process ﬁnishes,29 the outputs
are the total cluster energy and a set of localized wave
functions, one for each geometrically nonequivalent ion of
the cluster. These localized cluster-consistent ionic wave
functions are then used to estimate the intraatomic cor-
relation energy correction through Clementi’s Coulomb-
Hartree-Fock method.51,52 The large multi-zeta basis sets
of Clementi and Roetti53 are used for the description of
the ions. At this respect, our optimizations have been
performed using basis sets (5s4p) for Na+ and (7s6p)

for Cl−, respectively. Inclusion of diﬀuse basis functions
has been checked and shown unnecessary. One impor-
tant advantage coming from the localized nature of the
model is the linear scaling of the computational eﬀort
with the number of atoms in the cluster. This has al-
lowed us to perform full structural relaxations of clusters
with as many as 58 ions at a reasonable computational
cost. Moreover, for each cluster size, a large number of
isomers (between 10 and 15) has been investigated. The
generation of the initial cluster geometries was accom-
plished by using a pair potential, as explained in previous
publications.41,42 The optimization of the geometries has
been performed by using a downhill simplex algorithm.54

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Lowest Energy Structures of [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+
Cluster Ions

In Fig.1 we present the optimized aiPI structures
of the ground state (GS) and lowest lying isomers or
[(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ (m=8–28) cluster ions. Below each
isomer we show the energy diﬀerence (in eV) with re-
spect to the ground state. The GS structures for m=6
and 7 are not shown in the ﬁgure because they were cal-
culated just to show the special stability of the m=8 size
(see next section). Nevertheless, they can be obtained by
simply removing one and two NaCl molecules from the
GS structure for m=8. All the low-lying isomers of m=8
are based on the 3×2×2 structure of the (NaCl)6 neutral
cluster (where the notation indicates the number of ions
along each of the three perpendicular cartesian axes), and
just diﬀer in the way the six extra ions are added to it.
The most favorable location for these extra ions is along
two opposite edges of the neutral, so that the two tri-
atomic NaClNa+ units minimice their mutual repulsion
without distorting too much the structure of the neutral
cluster. Zhang and Cook have visualized this structure
as the combination of two 3×3×1 planar sheets.37 Given
the bending of these sheets observed in the ab initio cal-
culations, we prefer to use the notation 3×2×2+3+3 for
this cluster, and will do it for the similar structures along
this paper. Irrespective of the notation used, however,
we must point out that our calculations essentially agree
with their suggestion. The GS structures of m=9 and 10
are much more distorted and diﬃcult to visualize, but
simply result from the addition of one and two NaCl
molecules, respectively, to the GS isomer of m=8. For
m=11, it is possible again to construct a quite compact
GS isomer by forming a 3×3×2+3+3 structure, again
in good agreement with the suggestions of Zhang and
Cook.37 This time the two added triatomics are on the
same face of the neutral structure, due to the speciﬁc dis-
position of the ionic charges, and thus the screening of
the excess charge is not as complete as for the m=8 case.
For m=12 a specially compact structure of a diﬀerent

2

kind appears. The GS for this size can be obtained from
that of the singly charged (NaCl)13Na+ cluster ion by
removing the inner six-coordinated chloride anion. This
structure had been suggested by the pair potential model
calculations of Martin34 and by the experiments of Li and
Whetten35 and Zhang and Cooks.37 These last authors
use the term “defect structure” to refer to this kind of
structure, and in this case we will use the same notation.
These two kinds of structures seem to have a very high
stability in the whole size range considered in this study.
For example, a×b×c+3+3 fragments are observed for
m=8,11,14,20 and 26. Defect structures are adopted as
GS structures for m=12 and 21. Note that for this last
size the anion vacancy is not located in the center of the
cluster but on an edge position. Anions are more stable
the larger their coordination number (the opposite holds
for cations)29,30, so the removal of an anion with six co-
ordination will be in general not favored energetically.
m=12 is an exceptional case in the sense that a highly
compact and symmetrical structure can be obtained by
removing the central anion from a 3×3×3 singly charged
cluster ion. A symmetrical structure tends to be favored
by the Madelung energy component, which is the most
important contribution to binding in ionic systems, and
this compensates for the loss of the most stable anion in
the cluster. The same will not be true for most of the
other values of m where a defect structure can be formed.
Another specially compact cluster that could ﬁt into the
defect structure category is m=24, which can be obtained
from the 4×4×3+3 structure of (NaCl)25Na+ by remov-
ing a corner anion. The only compact cluster that does
not ﬁt into any of these two categories is m=17, that
can be viewed as the combination of two singly charged
blocks, namely 3×3×3 and 3×3×1. Although this last
structure coincides also with that advanced by Zhang
and Cooks,37 a detailed comparison with their sugges-
tions shows that the agreement is not completely good
for other sizes. For example, the GS structure of m=20
is predicted to result from the merging of two 3×3×3
blocks. We obtain indeed this structure as a low lying
isomer (see Fig. 1), so that those authors were not too
far from the real answer. Similarly, the GS structure for
m=26 was predicted to be a combination of 5×3×3 and
3×3×1 blocks instead of the structure shown in Fig. 1.
The GS structures for the rest of the sizes are mainly
obtained by adding or removing NaCl molecules from the
compact clusters of one of the two families mentioned in
the last paragraph. One exception could be m=23, which
is formed by adding a bent NaClNa+ triatomic unit to a
compact 5×3×3 structure.

Comparing to the results of our previous papers on
neutral and singly charged alkali halide clusters,29–31
we appreciate that the structures found in those cases
can serve as “seeds” for the generation of those of the
doubly charged clusters. Speciﬁcally, the magic num-
ber structures of the neutrals (AX)n (n=6, 9, 12, 15,
etc) serve to generate specially stable [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+
cluster ions with m=8, 11, 14, 17, 20, etc, by edge at-

taching of NaClNa+ triatomic units. Specially compact
doubly charged isomers can also be obtained by removing
a chloride anion from one of the singly charged (AX)nA+
cluster ions, being this the case for m=12 and 21, or by
adding a triatomic to the singly charged clusters, for ex-
ample m=17.

B. Relative stabilities and connection to
experimental mass spectra

In the experimental mass spectra,37 the populations
observed for some cluster sizes are enhanced over those
of the neighboring sizes. These “magic numbers” are
a consequence of the evaporation/fragmentation events
that occur in the cluster beam, mostly after ionization.55
A magic cluster of size m has a stability that is large com-
pared to that of the neighboring sizes (m-1) and (m+1).
Thus, on the average, clusters of size m undergo a smaller
number of evaporation/fragmentation events, and this
leads to the maxima in the mass spectra. A most conve-
nient quantity to compare with experiment is the second
energy diﬀerence

∆2(m) = [E(m + 1) + E(m − 1)] − 2E(m),

(1)

where E(m) is the total energy of the [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+
cluster ion. A positive value of ∆2(m) indicates that the
m-stability is larger than the average of the (m+1)- and
(m-1)-stabilities.

We show in ﬁgure 2 our results concerning the
stabilities of the doubly charged cluster ions. The
magic numbers can be divided into two subsets: sizes
m=8,11,14,17,20 and 26 show large maxima in the ∆2(m)
curve; sizes m=9,12,21 and 24 show smaller but positive
values of ∆2(m). All the enhanced stabilities found in the
experiments in this size range, namely m=11,12,17,20,21
and 26,37 are reproduced by our calculations.
Sizes
m=8 and 9 are too small to be observed in the exper-
iments by Zhang and Cooks, who found a critical size
for the stability of the doubly charged cluster ions of
m=11. After the stability island found at sizes m=11–
12, no doubly charged cluster ion was observed in the
experiments37 until reaching a value of m=17, so that
the magic number m=14 is not observed either. Fi-
nally, although m=24 is not considered a magic num-
ber in their paper37 due to some scatter in the experi-
mental data, it is concluded that it might exhibit some
enhanced stability. Thus, the agreement with experi-
ment can be considered excellent. It is a very interest-
ing question that deserves further investigation, however,
why the metastable potential energy minima of cluster
ions in the size range m=13–16 can not be populated
in the experiments. Li and Whetten35 produced the
doubly charged cluster series by soft anion photoejec-
tion from the singly charged (AX)nA+ series, and found
that the stability island observed for m=11–12 is a con-
sequence of the high eﬃciency of that process for the

3

parent cluster with n=13. We note that halogen pho-
toejection from the GS structure of (AX)14A+ found in
previous publications31 would lead directly to the GS iso-
mer of [(NaCl)13(Na)2]2+ shown in Fig. 1, but in this
case the process is not so eﬃcient as for n=13. One
could speculate that the one-coordinated cation left in
the structure is very prone to dissociate even for very
modest excess vibrational energies. On the other hand,
photoejection of a halide anion from the GS structure
of (AX)15A+, which is also based on attaching ions to
a 3×3×3 compact cube, would not directly populate the
GS structure of [(NaCl)14(Na)2]2+, which is an elongated
structure. Nevertheless, calculations on the evaporation
kinetics processes would be needed in order to draw def-
inite conclusions.

Now we try a rationalization of the enhanced stabil-
ities in terms of structural properties. Hopefully, this
will allow the GS structures of clusters larger than those
explicitely included here to be predicted with some con-
ﬁdence. A general feature of [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ cluster
ions in the size range considered in this paper is that
a×b×c+3+3 fragments are specially stable compared to
other isomers whenever they can be formed. The ap-
parent reason is that those structures tend to minim-
ice the repulsion between the two excess positive charges
while not distorting too much the compact a×b×c struc-
tures of the neutrals, which are energetically favored by
purely Madelung energy considerations.29,30 As the pref-
ered place to attach the NaClNa+ triatomic units is along
edges of the neutral structures, for larger sizes (where
none of the three edges will contain just three ions) one
can advance a corresponding relevance of a×b×c+5+5
structures. In all cases, at least one of the three edges
of the neutral structures has to contain an even num-
ber of ions in order to preserve charge neutrality and
expose a convenient binding site for the tri- or penta-
atomic chains. To these structural families we have to
add the defect structures obtained by removing a halide
anion from the a×b×c compact structures that occur for
the singly charged (AX)nA+ cluster ions when all three
edges contain an odd number of ions.
In Table I we
show all the relevant fragments of those kinds. Each
series (except the defect one) has a typical periodicity
that could in principle be reﬂected in diﬀerent portions
of the mass spectra, given the high stability of these
fragments. We can see that the great majority of the
magic numbers observed in the experiments by Zhang
and Cooks37 can be explained in terms of the structures
shown in the table. Thus, m=12,21,(24),30,36,52 and
61 are ascribed to defect structures based on 3×3×3,
5×3×3, (4×4×3+3), 7×3×3, 5×5×3, 7×5×3 and 5×5×5
parent singly charged structures (m=52 was observed to
show some enhanced stability, although less than those
of the others).37 m=8,11 and 14 are p×2×3+3+3 struc-
tures with p=2,3 and 4, respectively. m=20,26 and 32
are p×4×3+3+3 with p=3,4 and 5. Finally, m=34,44,54
and 64 are p×4×5+5+5 structures with p=3,4,5 and 6.
Note that the values of p are as close as possible to the

4

lengths of the other edges, as expected. With the only ex-
ception of m=17, all the experimental magic numbers ﬁt
into any of these categories, which we consider evidence
enough for the correcteness of the structures proposed.
We note that the stability of the defect-like structures is
reduced with respect to that shown by the other magic
numbers (see Fig. 2). Note also that the inclusion of
the merged block structures of Zhang and Cooks37 is not
needed to explain the enhanced stabilities, even though
they will surely be low energy isomers for those sizes
where they can be formed.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The structures and stabilities of doubly charged
[(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ cluster ions have been studied in the
size range m=6–28 by means of ab initio Perturbed Ion
calculations. For this size range, we have found two main
(a) those ob-
groups of specially compact structures:
tained by adding triatomic chains to the edges of a×b×3
perfect neutral cuboids (NaCl)n, with n=m-2, and (b)
those obtained by removing one chloride anion from the
perfect a×b×c cuboids of the singly charged cluster ions
(NaCl)nNa+, with n=m+1. The way in which these
structures are constructed indicates that there is a cor-
relation with the structures found previously for neutral
and singly charged alkali halide clusters.29–31 A compar-
ison with the structural assignment suggested by Zhang
and Cooks37 after an interpretation of their collision in-
duced fragmentation spectra shows a good level of agree-
ment. Nevertheless, there are some minor discrepancies.
For example, the merged block structures suggested in
their work are not found to be the GS isomers for any
size, even though they are low lying structural isomers.
The calculated enhanced stabilities show an excellent
agreement with the experimental results, being this an
ideal check for the correctness of our theoretical calcula-
tions. The only calculated magic numbers that are not
present in the experimental mass spectra are those of
m=8, 9 and 14. The experiments are not able to pop-
ulate the metastable potential energy minima of these
structures, however, so that no comparison is possible
in these cases. With the only exception of m=17, we
ﬁnd that all the enhanced cluster stabilities are a con-
sequence of the highly compact structures that can be
built for certain values of m and mentioned in the previ-
ous paragraph. Given the high stability of the structures
obtained by adding triatomic chains to compact neutral
structures, we have proposed that the structures result-
ing from adding pentaatomic chains to the edges of larger
neutral clusters should also be specially stable. Taking
all these structural families altogether, we have shown
that we can reproduce all the magic numbers observed
in the experimental mass spectra.

Captions of Figures and Tables.
Figure 1. Lowest-energy structure and low-lying iso-
mers of [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ cluster ions. Dark balls are
Na+ cations and light balls are Cl− anions. The energy
diﬀerence (in eV) with respect to the most stable struc-
ture is given below the corresponding isomers.

Figure 2. Size evolution of ∆2(m) (eq. 1). The local
maxima in the second energy diﬀerence curve are shown
explicitely.

Table I Structural series, together with their inherent
periodicities, used to explain the experimentally observed
magic numbers. Those cluster sizes m that are actually
observed to show an enhanced stability in the mass spec-
tra of [(NaCl)m(Na)2]2+ clusters are written in boldface.
m=17 is the only exception (see text).

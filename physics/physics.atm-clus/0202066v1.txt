Abstract. We present a new formalism for the description of multiphoton plasmon
excitation processes in jellium clusters. By using our method, we demonstrate that, in
addition to dipole plasmon excitations, the multipole plasmons (quadrupole, octupole,
etc) can be excited in a cluster by multiphoton absorption processes, which results
in a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between plasmon resonance proﬁles in the cross sections for
multiphoton as compared to single-photon absorption. We calculate the cross sections
for multiphoton absorption and analyse the balance between the surface and volume
plasmon contributions to multipole plasmons.

Introduction

In the present paper we demonstrate that, in addition to dipole plasmon excitations
multipole plasmons (quadrupole, octupole, etc) contribute to the multiphoton excitation
process, which results in a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of plasmon resonance proﬁles between
the cross sections for multiphoton and single-photon absorption. We have developed a
formalism from which the cross sections for multiphoton excitation can be worked out.
The balance between multipole surface and volume plasmon contributions is analyzed.
Our results are obtained within a theoretical model for the multiphoton excitation of a
jellium cluster. This model is applicable to metal clusters, to fullerenes and to any type
of cluster in which a strong delocalization of valence atomic orbitals takes place. The
theoretical formalism we have developed is not conﬁned in its application to photons.
It can also be used to describe any kind of higher order plasmon excitation processes,
for example those which arise by multiple scattering of electrons within the cluster.

Recently, a number of papers have discussed metallic clusters [1, 2] and fullerenes
[3] in strong laser ﬁelds. The theoretical approach usually followed is to solve a time-
dependent local density equation numerically (LDA or local-density approximation),
and the regime most commonly studied involves intense, short laser pulses, for which
the turn-on and turn-oﬀ properties signiﬁcantly aﬀect excitation.

We report here on a diﬀerent problem: our initial interest lies in lower laser powers,
for which multiphoton excitation just begins to intrude, and we are interested in
developing a formalism to describe the interaction between collective modes and a laser
ﬁeld in the multiphoton regime. For this purpose, a semiclassical model, in which the
collective ﬂow of charge is driven by a periodic ﬁeld, is established, and we relate it to
the multiphoton absorption cross section of the cluster, which takes account of quantum
mechanics. Of course, one can in principle extend this treatment to consider the turn-on
and turn-oﬀ of laser pulses, to treat the interaction numerically for various power levels
and initial charge distributions. What we wish to point out, however, is a novel feature,
which arises even for an inﬁnite wavetrain interacting with a cluster (the simplest and
most fundamental problem): multiple plasmon excitations are driven by multiphoton
excitations. In the present paper, we explain by what mechanism this arises.

Our approach is based on diﬀerent principles from the LDA. Instead of using the
Kohn-Sham formalism, we propose a hydrodynamic approach. In the LDA, all quantities
are made to depend solely on charge density, and currents are subsequently made to
appear by solving a time-dependent equation. In our approach, we start out from the
continuity equation and the Euler equation, from which both the current ﬂow and the
density are obtained in a completely consistent way. Our theory is local, and does not
include exchange. In principle, it would be possible to extend it by building in exchange
and correlations in a similar way to the LDA. One of the beneﬁts of our approach is that
all the momentum transfer terms are included in the formulation, which leads to the
presence of both volume and surface plasmon terms. If one wishes to simplify the theory,
it is possible towards the end of the calculation to assume zero momentum transfer, in
which case the volume plasmon terms disappear from the problem.

Surface plasmon excitations are well known in atomic cluster physics. The
dipole surface plasmons are responsible for the formation of giant resonances in
photoabsorption spectra of metal clusters (see e.g.
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]). They
also play an important role in inelastic collisions of charged particles with metal clusters
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]. The role of surface plasmon excitations in inelastic electron-
cluster scattering was thoroughly studied in [13, 17, 18, 19], and it was demonstrated
that collective excitations make a signiﬁcant contribution to the electron energy loss
spectrum (EELS) in the region of the surface plasmon resonance. With increasing
scattering angle, plasmon excitations of higher angular momenta become more and
more prominent.

3

Plasmons are characteristic of delocalised electrons, and therefore the jellium model
provides the most appropriate starting point for a discussion of plasmon excitation
in the multiphoton regime. This regime is particularly appropriate for the study of
atomic clusters, which are rather fragile objects, and readily explode under very strong
irradiation [20]

The inelastic scattering of fast electrons on metal clusters in the range of transferred
energies above the ionization threshold was considered in [21]. It was demonstrated that,
in this energy range, volume plasmons dominate the contribution to the diﬀerential
cross section, resulting in a resonance behaviour. The volume plasmon resonances
excited in the cluster during a collision decay via the ionization process. The resonance
frequency and the autoionization width of the volume plasmon excitations have both
been determined in [21].

The role of the polarization interaction and plasmon excitations in the process
of electron attachment to metal clusters has also been examined both theoretically
[22, 23] and experimentally [24]. It was demonstrated that plasmon excitations induce
a resonance enhancement of the electron attachment cross section.

Our paper is organized as follows.

In section 2, we derive quantum mechanical
expressions for the cross sections of multipole (quadrupole, octupole etC) plasmon
excitations taking place in the multiphoton absorption regime and estimate the cross
sections on the basis of the plasmon resonance approximation. We present and
discuss the multiphoton absorption proﬁles and demonstrate a signiﬁcant change of
the multiphoton absorption proﬁles in the cross sections for multiphoton as compared
to single-photon absorption. In section 3, we establish certain connections of the cross
sections with the variation of electron density in the cluster due to the external ﬁeld
and present the formalism for the calculation of the electron density variation in the
cluster due to the external ﬁeld, based on the use of the hydrodynamic Euler equation
and on the equation of continuity. We apply the general formalism to the description of
fast electron-cluster scattering and multiphoton absorption. In section 4, we calculate
the multipole moments of the system induced by the external ﬁeld on the basis of the
formalism outlined in section 3. We analyse the plasmon resonance structure of the
induced multipole moments and conclude that it is analogous to the one arising in the
multiphoton absorption cross sections calculated in section 2.
In section 5, we draw
conclusions from this work. In Appendix A, we show how matrix elements for collective
transitions can be calculated on the basis of the sum rules. In Appendix B, we present
details of calculations of the angular integrals arising in the formalism outlined here.

2. Plasmon resonance approximation for multiphoton absorption cross
sections

First, we consider the cross section for multiphoton absorption in jellium clusters and
demonstrate that multipole plasmon excitations are essential to this process. The
discussion in this section is based on the plasmon resonance approximation, which is
introduced below.

2.1. Single photon absorption

Let us start by considering the simplest example and calculate the cross section for
single-photon absorption in the plasmon resonance approximation.

The single-photon absorption cross section in the dipole approximation reads as

σ1 =

4π2e2
c

ω

zon|

2δ(ωno −

¯hω)

n |
X

Here, e is the charge of electron, c is the velocity of light, ¯h is Planck’s constant,
ε0 is the electron excitation energy, ω is the photon frequency and ezon is
ωno = εn −
the matrix element of the z- component of the cluster dipole moment. The summation
over n includes all ﬁnal states of the excited electron, which belong to both the discrete
and the continuous spectra.

In the jellium picture, which works reasonably well for metal clusters and to some
extent for fullerenes, the main contribution to the cross section (1) arises from a small
group of excited states or sometimes even from a single transition of frequency close
to the classical Mie resonance frequency – also known as the frequency of the plasmon
resonance. For a spherical metal cluster, this frequency is given by (see e.g. [10, 17] and
section 4 of this paper)

ω2

l =

4πNe2

mV ·

l
(2l + 1)

.

Here V = 4πR3/3 is the cluster volume, where R = roN 1/3 is the cluster radius, ro
is the Wigner-Seitz radius; N is the number of delocalized electrons in a cluster, l is the
angular momentum of the plasmon mode, m is the electron mass. Note that, by using a
4eV , one can, in practice, excite only l = 1 dipole plasmon
single photon of energy 1
oscillations in a metallic cluster.

For nearly-spherical fullerenes C20 or C60, the plasmon resonance frequency is equal

(3)

to (see [11, 17])

ω2

l =

l(l + 1)N
(2l + 1)R3

where N is the total number of delocalised electrons (4 electrons per atom times the

number of carbon atoms in the fullerene molecule) and R is the the radius of the
fullerene.

The plasmon resonance approximation is based on the fact that excitations in
the vicinity of a plasmon resonance exhaust the sum rule almost completely (see
[4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11]), which means that the summation in the sum rule (see e.g. [25])

need be performed only over excited states in the vicinity of the Mie resonance.

The width Γ1 is due to Landau damping.

Its calculation for metal clusters is

performed, for example, in [21].

The cross section (6) reproduces correctly the appearence of the plasmon resonances
in single-photon absorption spectra of metal clusters and fullerenes, although some
details of the experimentally observed proﬁles are naturally beyond the plasmon
resonance approximation. The discussion of these details is not the scope of the
present work. This can only be done accurately enough on the basis of ab initio
many-body theories.
Instead, we analyse the multiphoton absorption cross sections
on the basis of the plasmon resonance approximation and elucidate the role of multipole
plasmon excitations in its formation, because our interest lie in establishing the physical
mechanisms which underpin multiphoton excitation.

2.2. Two-photon absorption

In the dipole approximation, the two-photon absorption cross section is equal to

Here, we have also introduced a dipole plasmon resonance width Γ1 and used the
sum rule (4) for the evaluation of the matrix elements for the dipole plasmon excitation
N¯h/2mω1. The remaining matrix elements zn1 in (8) describe dipole transitions
r10|
|
from the dipole plasmon resonance state to other excited states. Matrix elements for
these transitions obey the dipole selection rule. This means that the angular momentum
of the ﬁnal state can only be equal to either l = 0 or l = 2. According to (2) and (3),
there is no surface plasmon excitation with l = 0 either in metal clusters or in fullerenes.
Thus, only transitions to the states with l = 2 are of interest.

These arguments show that, by using two photons simultaneously, one can excite
the quadrupole plasmon resonance in a metal cluster or in a fullerene with a frequency
given in (2) and (3) respectively. When calculating the cross section (7) in the vicinity of
ω2, it is suﬃcient to consider
the quadrupole plasmon resonance excitation, i.e. at 2ω

This result demonstrates that the photoabsorption proﬁle in the two-photon process
diﬀers substantially from the single-photon case. The cross section (10) has a resonance
at the dipole plasmon frequency and, in addition, also contains the quadrupole plasmon
resonance at ω = ω2/2.

The cross section (10) depends on

2. The transition matrix element z21 describes
the electron transition between the dipole and quadrupole plasmon resonance states.
This is a single electron transition rather than a collective one. Therefore, calculation
of z21 on the basis of the sum rule (4) would lead to a signiﬁcant overestimate of the
value of this matrix element. Instead, one can use Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
for the evaluation of z21 [26]. By estimating the radial component of the momentum of
a single electron in a dipole and quadrupole plasmon oscillatory mode as p1 ∼

and p2 ∼

(cid:16)

We note that the cross section (13) depends explicitly on Planck’s constant ¯h, while
the cross section (6) does not. The independence of (6) from ¯h is connected with the fact
that plasmon oscillations are a purely classical eﬀect, while the dependence of (13) on ¯h
arises from the interaction between dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes as can be seen
from estimate (11) and the explicit expression (12). This indicates that it is meaningful
to treat plasmon excitations classically, while the coupling of various plasmon modes
in the multiphoton photoabsorption process must be treated beyond purely classical
theory.

In ﬁgure 1 we plot the cross section proﬁles per unit atom for single-photon (dashed
line) and two-photon (solid line) absorption calculated according to (6) and (13). These
proﬁles do not depend on the number of atoms in the cluster. Note that the scales are
not the same for the two curves for reasons of deﬁnition of the cross sections in the single-
and two-photon cases, but are both given in atomic units. The peak in the single-photon
plot gives the location of the dipole resonance. The other peak in the two-photon plot is
the quadrupole resonance. This ﬁgure demonstrates a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
nature of the proﬁles, arising from the presence of quadrupole plasmon excitation in the
two-photon case. In this calculation we have input r0 = 4.0 and Γ1 = ω1/4, Γ2 = ω2/4,
∆R = r0. The choice of these parameters can be diﬀerent for diﬀerent clusters, but it
should always lead to qualitatively similar single- and two-photon absorption proﬁles.
An accurate determination of the parameters is only possible on the basis of ab initio
calculations.

2.3. n-photon absorption

The formalism we have developed can also be used for the evaluation of the multiphoton
absorption cross sections for a larger number of photons. In the dipole approximation

The plasmon resonance structure of the multiphoton absorption cross section (15)
can be analysed in a similar way to the previous treatments for the single- and
two-photon cases. This analysis immediately leads to the important conclusion that
plasmon resonances with larger angular momenta (octupole, etc) can be excited in the
multiphoton absorption regime. Thus, for example, with three photons, the octupole
plasmon resonance at ω = ω3/3 will also be excited. This analysis, however, leaves
undeﬁned the matrix elements for electronic transitions between various plasmon modes.
Estimates of these can be performed either on the basis of Heisenberg’s Uncertainty
Principle or by a calculation similar to the one for Z12 (see (12) and (10)) in the two-
photon case, but their accurate evaluation is not trivial.

Note that the plasmon resonance approximation allows one to analyse only the
plasmon resonance excitations that are characterised by relatively low angular momenta,
because electron excitations in the cluster with large angular momenta l have single-
particle character. This follows, for instance, from the fact that with increasing l the
wave length of the surface plasmon mode, 2πR/l, becomes smaller than the characteristic
wave length of the delocalised electrons at the Fermi surface, 2π¯h/√2m∆ε, where ∆ε is
the characteristic electron excitation energy in the cluster. In other words, excitations
with angular momenta comparable with the characteristic electron angular momenta of
the ground state exhibit single-particle rather than collective character. Therefore, when
analyzing contributions of the plasmon resonance modes to the multiphoton absorption
cross section, one should consider only the lowest angular momenta. For example
according to the jellium model, the maximum angular momentum of the delocalised
electrons in the Na40 cluster is equal to 4. Therefore, only dipole and quadrupole
collective modes can be expected in this case. With increasing cluster size the number
of essential plasmon modes grows as R.

3. Hydrodynamic description of collective motion of the electron density
in a cluster

The multipole plasmon resonances arising in the multiphoton absorption cross sections,
should also appear in other physical characteristics of the cluster, which can be probed
in the multiphoton absorption regime.
In the situation where plasmon resonance
excitations are the dominant contribution to the multiphoton absorption cross section,
it is natural to seek and analyse the plasmon resonance structure of the variation of
electron density induced by the radiation ﬁeld. The variation of electron density is
a characteristic of the system, allowing one easily to connect classical and quantum
descriptions of the excitation process, because charge density variation has the same
meaning in both quantum and classical mechanics. A classical description of the electron
density variation in a cluster is appropriate in the situation where plasmon excitations

dominate over the single-particle spectrum, because plasmon oscillations in clusters are
an essentially classical eﬀect.

3.1. Basic equations

Since our object of interest is the excitation of plasmons in metallic clusters, which
have a distinctly classical nature, we now describe the collective motion of the electron
density using Euler’s equation and the equation of continuity.

Euler’s equation couples the acceleration of the electron density dv/dt with the total
local electric ﬁeld E acting on the density at the point (r, t). It has the following form:

dv(r, t)
dt

e
m

=

E(r, t)

The electric ﬁeld E includes both the external ﬁeld acting on the cluster and the
polarization contribution arising from the variation of electron density. Expressing the
total derivative on the left hand side of (16) as the sum of two contributions, arising
from the change in velocity of the electron density in time and in space, one obtains:

∂v(r, t)

(17)

Here ϕ(r, t) is the potential of the external ﬁeld. The second term on the right
hand side of (17) describes the polarization force due to the variation of electron density
δρ(r, t).

We assume that the external potential ϕ(r, t) is the solution of the wave equation.

Therefore, we can put

ϕ(r, t) = eiωtϕ(r),

where ϕ(r, t) satisﬁes the equation

∆ϕ(r) =

k2ϕ(r).

−

Here k = ω/c, c is the velocity of light, but in principle one can postulate a more
complex dispersion law. We need consider only the positive frequency solution of the
wave equation, because the formalism for the negative frequency solution is analogous
to it.

The total electron density in the cluster is equal to

ρ(r, t) = ρo(r) + δρ(r, t),

where ρo(r) is the electron density distribution in a free cluster without an external
ﬁeld and δρ(r, t) is the variation of electron density caused by the external ﬁeld and the
polarization force acting together.

The simultaneous solution of equations (17), (20) and (21) with appropriate initial
conditions and the initial distribution ρo(r) allow one to determine the variation of
electron density δρ(r, t) as well as its velocity v(r, t). We solve this problem by using a
perturbative approach on the external ﬁeld ϕ(r, t).

to a Newtonian equation, which describes electronic motion in the cluster under the
action of the external ﬁeld and the polarization force.

The left hand side of equation (26) describes eigen-oscillations of the electron density.
The electron density is almost constant within the cluster but varies rapidly near the
cluster surface. Therefore, the terms proportional to ρo(r) and
ρo(r) on the left hand
side of (26) determine the square of the frequency of the volume and surface plasmon
oscillations respectively. The right hand side in (26) describes a driving force acting on
the eigen- plasmon oscillations.

The set of non-linear equations (24) and (26) must be solved iteratively. It is clear
from the form of the equations that the index n corresponds to the order of perturbation
theory on the external ﬁeld ϕ(r).

Equations (27) and (28) show that the variation ρ1(r′) describes the linear response
of the electron subsystem to the the external ﬁeld ϕ(r), while ρ2(r′) arises only in the
second order of perturbation theory on ϕ(r), because ρ1(r′)
ϕ(r).

ϕ(r) and v1(r)

Solving the set of equations (24) and (26) with ϕ(r) describing the dipole electron-
photon interaction up to the n-th order, one can calculate the variation of electron
density in the cluster caused by the ﬁeld of n photons.

∼

∼

The set of equations (24) and (26) is not conﬁned in its application to photons.
It can also be used to describe the dynamics of electron density under the action of
any kind of external ﬁeld, for example the electric ﬁeld of a charged projectile colliding
with the cluster. Indeed, by considering the partial spherical harmonic of the Fourier
image of the Coulomb ﬁeld of the projectile particle, one can derive from (27) the same
expression for the variation of the electron density δρ1(r) as follows from the purely
electrodynamical perturbative approach to the electron scattering problem [21].

3.3. Spherically symmetric case

Equations (24) and (26) are valid for an arbitrary shape of the initial distribution ρo(r).
In the spherical case, the angular parts in (24) and (26) can be separated. Thus, the

cross section for n-photon absorption can in principle be extracted for arbitrarily large
n, although the calculations become more and more tedious the higher n is. Let us
consider this formalism in more detail.

In the case of the spherically symmetric initial distribution, one can put ρo(r) =
ρ0(r). This relationship allows one easily to exclude angular variables from equation
(26). Using this relationship together with the partial expansion for δρn(r) and ϕ(r),

δρn(r) =

clear that the non-gradient terms in the sum contain the integration of the product of
three spherical harmonics, if one expands δρn−j(r) and ϕ(r) according to (29) and (30),

Here and below, we assume that the summation over l1, m1 and l2, m2 is performed

with the same limits as in (29) and (30).

3.4. Surface and volume plasmons

We now analyse equation (40) and demonstrate that it describes both surface and volume
plasmon oscillations. The surface and volume solutions of (40) can be separated from
each other, if one assumes that the initial distribution of electron density has the form

ρo(r) =

Ne
V

Θ(Rv −

r)

Here N is the total number of delocalized electrons in the cluster volume V = 4πR3

v/3.
In this case it is natural to look for the solution of (40) by expressing it in the

following form

δρ(n)

l,m(r) = δρs(n)

l,m δ(Rs −

r) + δρv(n)

l,m (r)Θ(Rv −

r)

In (41) and (42) we have introduced the two radii Rv and Rs and assumed that
Rs = R, where R is the cluster radius. Such a relationship is
Rv < Rs = R, but Rv →
necessary for the elimination of the uncertainties, which arise in (42) and the subsequent
formulae in the vicinity of the cluster radius.

The left hand side of equation (43) describes volume and surface eigen-oscillations
of the electron density characterised by the angular momentum l. The surface plasmon
resonance frequency ωl is the same as in (2). The volume plasmon resonance frequency
is equal to

ωp =

4πe2N
mV

s

In equation (43), ωp appears in expressions involving l, but is nevertheless is independent
of l, as one sees in equation (45). The physical reason for this is that the volume plasmon
oscillation is degenerate with l. The right hand side of (43) describes a driving force
acting on the eigen-plasmon oscillations.

Surface and volume terms on the right hand side of equation (43) have not been
regrouped, in order to stress their correspondencce with terms in (40). It is seen from
(43) that equations for the volume and surface plasmon oscillations can be separated
and will then read as follows:

The set of non-linear equations (46) and (47) must be solved iteratively starting
from n = 1. It is clear from the form of these equations that the index n corresponds to
the order of perturbation theory on the external ﬁeld ϕ(r). It is also seen that the chain
of equations for the volume plasmon oscillations is self-suﬃcient, while the solutions
for the surface oscillations also depend on those for volume, which is physically clear,
because the electric ﬁeld caused by volume oscillations of electron density must inﬂuence
surface oscillations.

From (46) and (47), one derives the following solutions for n = 1:

the external ﬁeld (photons) by the cluster leads to the excitation of non-dipole plasmon
oscillations of the electron density.

Equations (46- 51) can be used for the analysis of the balance between the surface and
volume plasmon oscillations in the cluster. We demonstrate this for the example of fast
electron scattering on a metal cluster. In this case, the external ﬁeld of the projectile
electron can be characterized by the Fourier component of the Coulomb potential

This cross section is totally determined by collective electron excitations in the

In (58), we have also indroduced
widths, Γs

the Landau damping mechanism of the plasmon excitations. For their determination
we refer to the recent paper [21].

3.6. Multiphoton absorption

Next, we apply equations (46) and (47) to the description of the multiphoton absorption
process. In this paper, we focus our consideration on the analysis of plasmon excitations.

k = 0. In this case, equations (46) and (47) are simpliﬁed dramaticaly. Indeed, from

Induced multipole moments in the cluster

Let us now calculate the multipole moments of the cluster induced by an external
radiation ﬁeld on the basis of the model developed in the previous section, and analyse
their plasmon resonance structure.

In the multiphoton regime, the connection between the induced multipole moments
of the cluster and the multiphoton absorption cross section becomes more complex,
which is apparent from the the classical nature of the expressions (71-73) and the explicit
dependence of the multiphoton absorption cross sections on Planck’s constant. The
discussion of this interesting relationship is however beyond the scope of the present
paper.

5. Conclusion

In this paper, we have developed a formalism which allows one to calculate the cross
section for multiphoton absorption in the plasmon resonance approximation. We
have demonstrated that plasmon excitations with angular momenta larger than 1
substantially alter the proﬁle for multiphoton absorption as compared to the single-
photon case.

Our model is formulated in terms of a charge density distribution function ρ(r)
for the cluster. This means that, in principle, one can study the response for diﬀerent
charge density proﬁles including deformed ones. Our model is a semi-classical one, which
neglects the granularity of charge in the system. This is consistent with the principles
underlying the jellium picture. It is appropriate for metallic clusters and, to a lesser
extent, for fullerenes.

In the classical

formulation of our model, we have used Euler’s equation for
hydrodynamic ﬂow, together with the equation of continuity. We have demonstrated
that the results following from our model are consistent with direct estimates of the
matrix elements for the multiphoton absorption process. The theoretical formalism we
It can also be used to
have developed is not conﬁned in its application to photons.
describe any kind of higher order plasmon excitation processes, for example those which
arise by multiple scattering of electrons within a cluster.

Appendix A. Matrix elements of plasmon resonance transitions

In this appendix, we evaluate the matrix elements of plasmon resonance transitions in
the plasmon resonance approximation by the use of the sum rule.

For a stationary (i.e. explicitly independent of time) operator ˆF of an observable

The radial transition density ρl0(r) is localised in the vicinity of the cluster
surface. Qualitatively, this is clear because ρl0(r) describes the plasmon excitation.
Quantitatively, this was proved by ab initio computations of the transition densities in
the Na40 and Na92 clusters within the jellium model in [19]. Therefore, to a reasonable
accuracy, one can approximate ρl0(r) by the delta function

Substituting (A11) into (A10) and comparing the result of the calculation with (A7),
one can determine the value ρl0 entering (A11). The result of this calculation reads as

The integrations arising in (B21) can be performed and expressed via the sum of
products of 3j-symbols and 6j-symbols, using the standard formulae given in [27] on
pages 222 and 236. The result of the calculations of these integrals reads as

l1(l1 + 1)l2(l2 + 1)(2l + 1)

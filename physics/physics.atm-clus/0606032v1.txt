We systematically investigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Mnn clusters
(n = 2−20) within the ab-initio pseudopotential plane wave method using generalized gradient
approximation for the exchange-correlation energy. A new kind of icosahedral structural growth
has been predicted in the intermediate size range. Calculated magnetic moments show an excellent
agreement with the Stern-Gerlach experiment. A transition from ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic
Mn−Mn coupling takes place at n = 5 and the ferrimagnetic states continue to be the ground
states for the entire size range. Possible presence of multiple isomers in the experimental beam has
been argued. No signature of non-metal to metal transition is observed in this size range and the
coordination dependence of d−electron localization is discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The search for magnetic behavior in the transition
metal clusters is motivated largely by the desire to un-
derstand how magnetic properties change in the reduced
dimension. This is a question of considerable technolog-
ical importance. Several unexpected magnetic orderings
have already been reported in the reduced dimension.
This ranges from the prediction of net magnetic moment
in clusters of nonmagnetic (Rh, Ref. 1) or antiferromag-
netic (Cr, Ref. 2 and Mn, Refs. 3 and 4) bulk materials
to the enhancement in magnetic moment in clusters of
ferromagnetic metals (Fe, Ref. 5 and Co, Ref. 6).

Manganese clusters are particularly interesting among
all 3d transition metal elements due to the 4s2, 3d5 elec-
tronic conﬁguration in Mn atoms. Because of the ﬁlled 4s
and half-ﬁlled 3d shells and the large energy gap ∼ 8 eV
between these levels and as well as due to the high 4s23d5
→ 4s13d6 promotion energy of 2.14 eV7, Mn atoms do
not bind strongly. As a result, Mn2 is a weakly bound
van der Waals dimer with reported bond dissociation en-
ergy ranging from 0.1 ± 0.1 to 0.56 ± 0.26 eV depending
upon the diﬀerent method of analysis8,9,10,11. This weak
Mn− Mn bonding has been demonstrated through the
photodissociation experiments for Mn+
n (n ≤ 7) cluster
cations11,12. Consequently, the bulk α-Mn, which has a
very complex lattice structure with 58 atoms in the unit
cell, has the lowest binding energy among all the 3d tran-
sition metal elements.

Magnetic properties of manganese clusters are rather
unusual. According to Hund’s rule, the half-ﬁlled lo-
calized 3d electrons give rise to large atomic magnetic
moment of 5 µB. An early electron spin resonance
(ESR) study suggested a magnetic moment of 5 µB/atom
for very small Mn clusters13. However, Stern-Gerlach
(SG) molecular beam experiments on Mn5−99 clusters by

Knickelbein recently revealed the net magnetic moments
ranging from 0.4 to 1.7 µB/atom3,4. This diﬀers both
from the ferromagnetic (FM) small clusters and from the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) bulk α-Mn. This experimental
results can be explained either way that the individual
atomic moments are small and ordered ferromagnetically
or the individual atomic moments remain large but their
orientation ﬂips from site to site i.e., they are coupled
ferrimagnetically. In the SG experiment, it is important
to note the relative decrease in the magnetic moment
for Mn13 and Mn19, as well as the relatively very large
experimental uncertainty in the measured magnetic mo-
3,4. In the present work, we will show that
ment for Mn7
the local minima for Mn13 and Mn19 arise due to their
‘closed’ icosahedral structures, whereas, the large exper-
imental uncertainty (± 58 % of the measured value) in
the magnetic moment of Mn7 is plausibly due to the pro-
duction of diﬀerent magnetic isomers (in addition with
statistical ﬂuctuation) in the subsequent measurements.

Earlier all electron (AE) studies14,15,16 found Mn−Mn
FM ordering for Mnn (n > 4) clusters, which, in turn, is
not consistent with the SG experiment. However, Nayak
et al. ﬁrst predicted ferrimagnetic ground state for Mn13
with a total magnetic moment of 33 µB 17. In consistent
with the SG experiments, very recent AE studies by Par-
vanova et al.18,19 (n =2-9, 12 and 13) and Jones et al.20
(n = 5 and 6) reported ferrimagnetic ordering in Mnn
clusters. Briere et al.21 used ultra-soft pseudopotentials
(US-PP) to study the intermediate size Mnn clusters (n
= 13, 15, 19 and 23) and found icosahedral structural
growth with an exception for Mn15. However, their pre-
dicted magnetic moments diﬀer widely from the exper-
imental values. This might be attributed to the reason
that the US-PP may not be appropriate in describing
the transition metals with large magnetic moments. This
will be discussed brieﬂy later in the section II. Our main

motivation of this work is particularly driven by the SG
experiments3,4. Here we shall investigate − (i) The struc-
tural and magnetic evolution of Mnn clusters, n=2-20.
(ii) The sudden drop in the magnetic moment at n=13
and 19 and the very large experimental uncertainty in the
measured magnetic moment for Mn7, and (iii) The possi-
ble presence of isomers with diﬀerent magnetic structures
in the SG experimental molecular beam.

It has also been found by Parks et al. that the Mnn
clusters show a downward discontinuity in their reaction
rate with molecular hydrogen at n = 16, and this was
22.
attributed to non-metal to metal transition in Mn16
But if this is indeed true then there should be a down-
ward decrease in the ionization potential too. However,
no such abrupt decrease has been seen in the measured
ionization potential23. In the present paper, we calculate
both the spin gaps to investigate this issue.

II. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

The calculations are performed using density func-
tional theory (DFT), within the pseudopotential plane
wave method. We have used projector augmented wave
(PAW) method24,25 and Perdew-Bruke-Ernzerhof (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional26 for spin-polarized gen-
eralized gradient correction (GGA) as implemented in
the Vienna ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP)27. The
3d and 4s electrons are treated as valence electrons and
the wave functions are expanded in the plane wave basis
set with the kinetic energy cut-oﬀ 337.3 eV. Reciprocal
space integrations are carried out at the Γ point. Sym-
metry unrestricted geometry and spin optimizations are
performed using conjugate gradient and quasi-Newtonian
methods until all the force components are less than a
threshold value 0.005 eV/˚A. Simple cubic supercells are
used with the periodic boundary conditions, where two
neighboring clusters are kept separated by at least 12 ˚A
vacuum space. For each size, several initial geometrical
structures have been considered. To get the ground state
magnetic moment we have explicitly considered all pos-
sible spin conﬁgurations for each geometrical structure.
For transition metals with large magnetic moments, the
PAW method seems to be more appropriate (as good as
the AE calculations) than the US-PP approach25. The
US-PP overestimates the magnetization energies and this
overestimation is even more large for GGA calculations
than local spin density approximation (LSDA). This is
due to the fact that the GGA functionals are more sen-
sitive to the shape of the wave functions than the LSDA
functionals. However, the diﬀerence between these two
methods, US-PP and PAW, are solely related to the
pseudization of the augmentation charges in the US-PP
approach, which can be removed by choosing very ac-
curate pseudized augmentation function, which is then
computationally expensive. For a better description see
the Ref. 25 by Kresse and Joubert.

half of the shortest bond length in that cluster.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Small Ferromagnetic Clusters (Mn2 - Mn4)

The Mn2 dimer is the most controversial among all
the sizes we have studied. Experiments based on res-
onance Raman spectroscopy28 and ESR29 observed an
AFM ground state with a bond length 3.17 ˚A. Ex-
perimentally the binding energy was estimated to be
0.44 ± 0.30 eV/atom8,9,10. However, previous AE-DFT
calculations14,16,18,19, predicted a FM state to be the
ground state with much smaller bond length (∼ 2.60
˚A) than that of the experimental value.
In agreement
with these calculations, our present PAW pseudopoten-
tial calculations with PBE exchange-correlation function-
als, predict a FM ground state with total spin 10 µB and
with bond length 2.58 ˚A. Very small binding energy, 0.52
eV/atom, is essentially the characteristic of a van der
Waals system. However, the bond dissociation energy
increases by considerable amount due to the reduction
of one electron from the Mn2 dimer, i.e. by creating a
hole in the 4s level. As measured by the photodissoci-
ation experiment the bond dissociation (Mn+ · · · Mn)
energy increases to 1.39 eV for Mn+
2 cation30. We ﬁnd
that the bond length of Mn2 decreases monotonically as
the net moment decreases. This is consistent with the
physical picture that the reduction of the interatomic
spacing leads to comparatively stronger overlap of the
atomic orbitals which, in turn, reduces the magnetic mo-
ment. However, we ﬁnd Mn2 with total moment 4 and 6
µB are not bound. An AF Mn2 is 0.52 eV higher in en-
ergy with bond length 2.61 ˚A. The present results, along
with the previous AE-DFT calculations14,16,18,19, do not
agree with the experimental results. This might be at-
tributed to the fact that the density functional theory is
not adequate in treating van der Waals interaction prop-
erly. However, there is no experimental results available
in the gas phase Mn2 dimer and the ESR experiment was
done in a rare gas matrix. Therefore, it is possible that
the Mn atoms do interact with the matrix, which could
stretch the bond length and could lead to the observed
AFM state.

state and low-lying isomers for Mn3 and Mn4 clusters. Num-
bers in the parenthesis represent number of atoms in the clus-

ment, respectively. Bond lengths are given in ˚A. Blue (Gray)
color represents up or positive and red (dark gray) represents
down or negative magnetic moment. We will follow the same
convention throughout.

The case of Mn3 is extremely interesting as it could
have either FM or a frustrated AFM structure. We have
studied triangular and linear structures. An equilateral
triangular FM state with total moment 15 µB is found
to be the ground state with bond lengths 2.74 ˚A and
binding energy 0.82 eV/atom. The frustrated AFM state
with total moment 5 µB is found to be nearly degenerate
with the FM ground state (lies only 0.05 eV higher in
energy). This has an isosceles triangular structure with
one long and two short bond lengths of 2.50 and 2.45
˚A, respectively (Fig.1). The resonance Raman spectra
studies by Bier et al.28 suggest the ground state to be
Jhan-Teller distorted D3h structure with an odd integer
magnetic moment.

For the Mn4 cluster, we examined three diﬀerent
conformations:
square, rhombus and tetrahedron. A
perfect tetrahedral structure with bond lengths 2.7 ˚A
and binding energy 1.18 eV/atom is the ground state,
where Mn−Mn coupling is FM with total moment 20 µB
(Fig.1). Three isomers are found and all of them are
tetrahedral. A ferrimagnetic state with total moment
10 µB is only 0.08 eV higher in energy. Another ferri-
magnetic state with total moment 8 µB is found to be
degenerate with the AF state with no net moment and
they are 0.20 eV higher in energy. In all these optimal
structures the distances between two similar spins (d↑↑ or
d↓↓) are larger than those of between two opposite spins
(d↑↓). Our results are consistent with the previous AE
calculations14,16,18,19. Ludwig et al.31 have studied Mn4
in solid silicon and observed a 21-line hyperﬁne pattern
that not only establishes the four atoms to be equivalent,
but also the total moment to be 20 µB. However, the
present results can not directly be compared with this ex-

periment because of possible Si-Mn interaction and there
is no available report of magnetic ordering for Mn4 in its
gas phase.

B. Mn5 - Mn10

As the number of atoms in the cluster (n) increases
the determination of the structural and magnetic ground
state becomes a very delicate task as the number of local

minima in the corresponding potential energy surface in-
creases exponentially with n. Therefore, more than one
geometric and/or magnetic structures of comparable sta-
bility are possible. In the Fig.2 we depict the atomic and
magnetic structures for the ground state as well as for
the closely lying isomers for the size range n = 5-10. As
it is mentioned earlier, to hit the ground state more re-
liably, we have studied all possible spin multiplicities for
several geometric structures for a particular cluster size
n. Calculated binding energies, relative energies, mag-
netic moments and two spin gaps are given in the Table
I for the entire size range n = 2-20.

For the Mn5 cluster, a square pyramid and a trian-
gular bi-pyramid (TBP) were studied. Transition in the
magnetic order, from FM to ferrimagnetic, is found. A
ferrimagnetic TBP is found to be the ground state with
total spin 3 µB. The next two isomers are also ferrimag-
netic in nature with total spins 13 µB and 5 µB. Both of
these structures also have TBP structure and lie 0.06 and
0.07 eV, respectively, higher in energy. The next lowest
energy arrangement is FM and also has a TBP structure
with total spin 23 µB and lies 0.19 eV higher in energy.
Our results are in agreement with the very recent AE
calculations18,19,20. However, previously the FM ground
state was predicted by both Nayak et al.14,15 and Ped-
erson et al.16. In the recent SG experiment4, magnetic
moment was found to be 0.79±0.25 µB/atom, which is
very close to our predicted value 0.60 µB/atom for the
ground state.

We have investigated both the octahedral and the
capped trigonal bi-pyramid for Mn6 cluster. A ferri-
magnetic octahedral structure with total spin 8 µB is
found to be the ground state with binding energy 1.57
eV/atom. Another octahedral ferrimagnetic isomer with
total moment 2 µB is nearly degenerate (0.02 eV higher
in energy). The next isomer is also a ferrimagnetic oc-
tahedra, which possess a total moment of 16 µB and lies
0.05 eV higher. The next favorable isomer is FM and
has a total moment 26 µB and is 0.14 eV higher than
the ground state.
In an earlier calculation, Pederson
et al.16 predicted a FM octahedral structure with mo-
ment 4.33 µB/atom to be the ground state. However, in
agreement with the recent AE-DFT calculations18,19,20,
present calculation predicts the same ground state and
isomers. Experimentally measured magnetic moment
0.55 ± 0.10 µB/atom4 lies between that of our predicted
ground state, 1.33 µB/atom and the ﬁrst isomer, 0.33
µB/atom, which are almost degenerate.
It is possible
that in the SG experimental beam, multiple isomers were
produced such that the measured value is almost an av-
erage of the ground state and the ﬁrst isomer.

We have considered pentagonal bi-pyramid (PBP),
capped octahedron and bi-capped trigonal pyramid as
the possible candidates for the ground state of Mn7. The
most stable conﬁguration is a PBP structure with fer-
rimagnetic spin ordering, which has a total moment 5
µB. The next two closest isomers also have ferrimag-
netic arrangements with 7 µB and 3 µB total moments

4

and they lie 0.09 eV and 0.20 eV higher than the ground
state, respectively. Our ground state magnetic moment
agrees with the earlier calculations18,19,32, though we pre-
dict isomers with diﬀerent spin arrangements. However,
Pederson et al. predicted a FM ground state16. Present
ground state magnetic moment per atom exactly matches
with the experimental value, 0.72 ± 0.42 µB/atom4. We
would like to note the rather large uncertainty here. We
argue that the plausible presence of these isomers, with
total moments 7 µB and 3 µB along with the ground
state (5 µB), in the SG beam might lead to this high
uncertainty in the measured value.

Motivated by our earlier study on Cu8

33,34, we inves-
tigated three diﬀerent geometries for Mn8, viz, capped
pentagonal bi-pyramid (CPBP), bi-capped octahedron
(BCO) and tri-capped trigonal bi-pyramid (TCTBP).
The BCO structure with total moments 8 µB and 12
µB are found to be degenerate ground state. Another
BCO structure with total moment 10 µB lies only 0.03 eV
higher in energy. The SG cluster beam experiment has
reported a magnetic moment of 1.04 ± 0.14 µB/atom4,
which is nearly an average of our predicted values. There-
fore, our present DFT study together with the experi-
ment in turn indicate the possible presence of these three
isomers in the experimental beam with almost equal sta-
tistical weight. The optimal CPBP and TCTBP struc-
tures have total moments 14 µB and 12 µB, respectively
and they lie 0.31 and 0.4 eV higher than the ground state.
Parvanova et. al.19 found CPBP structure to be the most
stable, however, their predicted magnetic moment is very
small, 4 µB, compared to both of our value and the SG
experiment. Pederson et. al.16 predicted a FM BCO
structure with moment 32 µB as the ground state. The
optimal FM structure for all the three geometrical struc-
tures have total moment 32 µB and lie 1.01, 0.63 and 1.17
eV higher in energy compare to their respective optimal
ferrimagnetic structure, respectively for BCO, CPBP and
TCTBP structures.

For the Mn9 cluster, as initial conﬁguration we took
33,34 and a capped and
three stable isomers found for Cu9
a centered antiprism structure. The optimal structure is
a centered antiprism structure with total moment 7 µB,
which is in very good agreement with the experimental
value 1.01 ± 0.10 µB/atom4. The local magnetic mo-
ment M (as calculated form the Eq. 2) shows strong
environment dependency due to the anisotropy in bond-
ing. The M of the highly coordinated central atom is
very small, −0.22 µB, whereas those of the surface atoms
are quite high and lie between 3.45 and 3.75 µB. Par-
vanova et al.19 have found a similar structure but with
diﬀerent spin conﬁguration with total moment 9 µB to
be the optimal structure. The next two isomers have the
same geometry and have 13 and 7 µB total magnetic mo-
ment (Fig.2 and Table I). The next isomer is a bi-capped
pentagonal bi-pyramid, which lies 0.21 eV higher with a
total moment of 9 µB. The optimal capped antiprism
structure lies 0.23 eV higher and has a total moment of 7
µB. Note that, all these structures have 5 spin-up (N↑)

atoms and 4 spin-down (N↓) atoms.

Diﬀerent tricapped pentagonal bi-pyramidal structures
along with diﬀerent tetra capped octahedral structures
were tried as initial structures for Mn10. Four isomers
exist with almost the same energy. They lie within ∼
0.01 eV energy (see Table I and Fig. 3). All of these
have a pentagonal ring and could be derived by removing
3 atoms from a 13-atom icosahedra. Ground state has a
total magnetic moment 14 µB, which is very close to the
SG experimental value, 1.34 ± 0.09 µB/atom4.

C.

Intermediate size clusters: Mn11 - Mn20

All the intermediate sized clusters with n = 11-20
are found to adopt an icosahedral growth pattern. The
ground state structures and the few isomers along with
their corresponding spin arrangements are shown in the
Fig.3. An icosahedral structure without one apex atom
is found to be the ground state for the Mn12 cluster. This
structure has N↑ = 8 and N↓ = 4 spin conﬁguration with
a total moment of 16 µB. This value is close to the ex-
perimentally measured value of 1.72 ± 0.04 µB/atom3,4.
Recently Parvanova et al. predicted the same geometri-
cal structure but with comparatively smaller, 1 µB/atom,
magnetic moment19. We have found two closely lying
isomers, which have the same geometrical structure with
total moments 4 µB and 18 µB (Table I). Another pos-
sible icosahedral structure without the central atom lies
much higher in energy.

The obvious candidates for the Mn13 cluster are the
icosahedral, hexagonal close packed (HCP) and cuboc-
tahedral structures. The variation of total energy as a
function of the total magnetic moment is plotted in the
Fig.4 for all these three conformations. The icosahedral
structure is found to be the ground state with N↑ = 7 spin
structure. The two pentagonal rings are AFM coupled for
this structure (Fig.3). Consequently, the magnetic mo-
ment is found to be small, 0.23 µB/atom. This predicted
magnetic moment is much smaller than those of its neigh-
boring Mn12 and Mn14 clusters (Fig.6), what has been
indeed predicted by the SG experiment3,4. Although, the
present value is much lower than the experimental value
of 0.54 ± 0.06 µB/atom4. However, we have found an-
other icosahedral isomer with magnetic moment exactly
the same with the experimental value, which lies only
0.08 eV higher in energy (Table I). This structure also
has N↑ = 7. Recently, Parvanova et al. predicted sim-
ilar magnetic ordering19. The optimal HCP and cuboc-
tahedral structures (Fig.3) have relatively higher mag-
netic moments 9 µB (N↑ = 7) and 11 µB (N↑ = 8) ,
respectively, and they lie much higher in energy, 0.89 eV
and 1.12 eV, respectively. Nayak et al. ﬁrst predicted a
ferrimagnetic state for Mn13. However, their predicted
magnetic moment is quite high (33 µB): all the surface
atoms are antiferromagnetically coupled with the central
atom17.

The ground state of Mn14 is the ﬁrst complete icosa-

5

hedra with a single atom capping. This structure has
N↑ = 9, with a magnetic moment 1.29 µB/atom. In this
structure the magnetic coupling between the two pen-
tagonal rings is FM, which was coupled antiferromagnet-
ically in the case of Mn13 and consequently, it has small
magnetic moment. The next two isomers lie very close
to the ground state: they lie only 0.02 eV and 0.05 eV
higher and have 1.43 and 1.57 µB/atom magnetic mo-
ment, respectively. These two isomers (not shown in
Fig.3) have the same N↑ = 9 spin structure, but with
their diﬀerent positional arrangement. The experimen-
tally predicted magnetic moment, 1.48 ± 0.03 µB/atom,
is an average of the ground state and the two isomers
(Table I), which again indicates that these isomers might
be produced along with the ground state in the SG ex-
periment.

The discrepancy between the present theoretical and
experimental magnetic moment is rather large for Mn15.
The present value is 0.87 µB/atom, whereas the corre-
sponding experimental value is 1.66 ± 0.02 µB/atom.
We have also found several isomers (Table I), but none
of them are close to the experimental value. The ground
state and all the closely lying isomers within ∼ 0.1 eV
energy spacing are of derived icosahedral structure. The
two competing icosahedral structures with 5,1,5,1,3 and
1,5,1,5,1,2 staking (i.e. without or with the apex atom)
are possible (Fig.3). The ﬁrst kind of structure is found
to be the ground state, whereas the optimal structure
for the second kind lies 0.06 eV higher with a magnetic
moment 13 µB (Fig.3). Another structure of the second
kind is found to be degenerate with this isomer, which
has a magnetic moment 7 µB (Table I). However, us-
ing US-PP Briere et al. found a bcc structure to be the
ground state with much smaller magnetic moment, 0.20
µB/atom21. In the present case this bcc kind of structure
lies 0.28 eV higher (Table I).

The same structural trend is observed in the case of
Mn16, the two diﬀerent competing geometries have been
found to be the possible candidates for the Mn16 clus-
ter. Both of these structures can be derived from the 19-
atom double icosahedra, which has a 1,5,1,5,1,5,1-atomic
staking. The ground state has a magnetic moment 1.25
µB/atom with N↑ = 9 spin structure. This structure has
5,1,5,1,4-atomic staking: both the apex atoms and one
atom from the lower pentagonal ring are missing from
the double icosahedra. The next isomer has the same
atomic arrangement and is almost degenerate, which lies
only 0.02 eV higher. This has 1.38 µB/atom magnetic
moment and the same (N↑ = 9) spin ordering. For
both of these structures the central pentagonal ring is
antiferromagnetically coupled with the upper and lower
(incomplete) pentagonal ring. The experimentally pre-
dicted value, 1.58 ± 0.02 µB,3,4 is very close to these
predicted values and conﬁrms the corresponding ground
state to be really of this ‘strange’ staking. The next two
isomers have a diﬀerent icosahedral geometry and have
comparatively smaller magnetic moment, 0.63 (Fig. 3)
and 0.50 µB/atom. They lie 0.06 and 0.1 eV higher,

respectively. Both of them have 1,5,1,5,1,3 staking, i.e.
the 13-atom icosahedra is complete. The two complete
pentagonal rings are antiferromagnetically coupled. All
these structures have same number of N↑ and N↓ but
have two diﬀerent class of atomic arrangements, which is
consequently the reason for their large diﬀerence in the
magnetic moment.

The Mn17 cluster follows the same structural trend
seen in both Mn15 and Mn16. The ground state is a dou-
ble icosahedra without both the apex atoms, i.e.
it has
5,1,5,1,5 staking. The spin structure is N↑ = 10 and the
central pentagonal ring is AFM coupled with the other
rings. This structure has a magnetic moment of 1.59
µB/atom, which is in excellent agreement with the ex-
periment, 1.44 ± 0.02 µB/atom4. The next two isomers
also have the same conformation as well as the same spin
structure. For this size the structure of the second kind
i.e. the icosahedral structure with one apex atom (Fig.3)
lies rather higher in energy. To our knowledge, there is
no available report for any other elements where this kind

of staking has been observed to be the ground state for
Mn15 − Mn17 clusters.

The Mn18 is the 19-atom double icosahedra without
one apex atom. The predicted magnetic moment is
1.67 µB/atom, whereas the experimental value is slightly
smaller, 1.20 ± 0.02 µB/atom4. Next two isomers are
nearly degenerate and have 1.56 and 1.44 µB/atom mag-
netic moment (Table I). For all these structures the in-
tegrated magnetization densities M for the central pen-
tagonal bi-pyramid are negative (Fig. 3).

The double icosahedral conformation is found to be the
ground state for Mn19. The predicted magnetic moment
is 1.10 µB/atom (Fig. 3), which is smaller than those
of its neighboring clusters, what has been predicted by
the experiment3,4. Another magnetic structure has been
found to be degenerate with 1 µB/atom magnetic mo-
ment (not shown in Fig. 3). Both of the structures have
N↓ = 7 and the central pentagonal ring is AFM coupled
with the other two rings. However, the predicted mag-
netic moment is larger than the experimentally measured

value, 0.41 ± 0.04 µB/atom4.
In our case a magnetic
structure with a magnetic moment 0.47 µB/atom (N↓ =
9), which is very close to the experimentally measured
value, lies only 0.08 eV higher in energy (Fig 3). The op-
timal FCC structure lies much higher, 1.53 eV, in energy,
which is shown in Fig. 3.

Two degenerate ground states have been found with
1.40 and 1.50 µB/atom magnetic moment for Mn20 clus-
ter. Both the structures have N↓ = 7 (Fig. 3) spin con-
ﬁguration and the conformation can be seen as a singly

capped 19-atom double icosahedra. The central pentag-
onal ring is antiferromagnetically coupled with the other
two rings. The predicted ground state magnetic mo-
ment is larger than the experimental value, 0.93 ± 0.03
µB/atom4. However, a diﬀerent spin structure (N↓ =
8) with magnetic moment 0.80 µB/atom, which is close
to the experimentally predicted value, lies only 0.07 eV
higher (Fig. 3).

In the intermediate size range, the grouping of like spin
atoms i.e spin segregation occurs (Fig. 3). For a par-
ticular sized cluster, we ﬁnd that the ferromagnetically
aligned atoms have longer average bond lengths35 than
those of the antiferromagnetically aligned ones. This is
because of the Pauli repulsion.

D. Binding Energies

The size dependence of the ground state binding en-
ergy for Mnn clusters (n =2-20) is shown in Fig. 5. Due
to the lack of hybridization between the half-ﬁlled 3d and
ﬁlled 4s states and due to high 4s23d5 → 4s13d6 promo-
tion energy, the Mn2 dimer is a weakly bound dimer,
which is a characteristic of van der Waals bonding8,9,10.
As the number of atoms in the cluster increases, the bind-
ing energy increases monotonically due to the increase in
the s−d hybridization. However, it remains weak as com-
pared to the other transition metal clusters in the same
size range. This weak bonding has been demonstrated
through the photodissociation experiments for Mn+
n (n ≤
7) cluster cations11,12. Recently, we have shown36 that if

agreement with the SG experiment. Isomers which lie very
close to the corresponding GS energy are also shown.

Although we see that for Mn3 cluster the FM solution
is nearly degenerate with the frustrated AFM solution.
The size dependence of the magnetic moment per atom
is plotted in the Fig.6. We see the transition in the mag-
netic coupling (from FM to ferrimagnetic) takes place at
n = 5 and the ferrimagnetic states continue to be the
ground state for the entire size range n =5-20. Fig.6
shows a very good agreement between experimentally
measured and our predicted magnetic moments. It was
seen in the SG experiment that the experimental un-
certainty in measuring the magnetic moment decreases
with the cluster size. However, this is not the case for
Mn7, for which the measured uncertainty is quite large
(0.72±0.42 µB, ±58% of the measured value) as com-
pared to the neighboing sizes. This large uncertainty
might arise from the presence of isomers with diﬀerent
magnetic moments in the SG beam for subsequent mea-
surements. However, in addition with the statistical ﬂuc-

which represents the relative stability.

an As-atom is doped to the Mnn clusters, the binding en-
ergies of the resultant MnnAs clusters increase substan-
tially due to their hybridized s − d electrons bond with
the p electrons of As. Similar enhancement in bonding
has also been seen due to the single nitrogen doping37.

Upon extrapolation of the linear ﬁt to the binding
energy per atom data to 1/n → 0 (Fig.5(a)), we ob-
tained the binding energy for an inﬁnitely large cluster
as 2.80 eV, which is very close to the experimental AF
bulk α-Mn (2.92 eV). It is important here to note the
kinks observed at n = 7 and 13 in the binding energy
curve (Fig.5). These kinks represent enhanced stabil-
ity rendered by their ‘closed’ geometric structures: Mn7
is PBP and Mn13 is the ﬁrst complete icosahedra.
If
this argument is valid then there should also be a kink
at n = 19, due to the fact it has double icosahedral
structure. But we do not see any prominent kink in
the binding energy curve. So, it will be interesting to
investigate the second diﬀerence in the binding energy,
∆2E(n) = E(n + 1) + E(n − 1) − 2E(n), where E(n)
represents the total energy of an n−atom cluster. As
∆2E(n) represents stability of the corresponding cluster
compared to its neighbors, the eﬀect will be prominent.
∆2E is plotted in the Fig.5(b), where we see a peak for
Mn19 too along with n = 7 and 13. However, in addition,
without any a priory reason, we observe another peak at
n = 17, which does not have ‘closed’ structure (a double
icosahedra without two apex atoms).

tuation, the above explanation only stands for a plausible
reason as for all other sizes we did ﬁnd many isomers with
diﬀerent magnetic moments (see Table I and Fig.6), but
the corresponding experimental uncertainty is not that
large. One another striking feature observed in the ex-
periment is the sudden decrease in the magnetic moment
at n=13 and 19, compared to their neighbors. Our cal-
culation reproduces this feature. This is attributed to
their ‘closed’ icosahedral structures: ﬁrst complete icosa-
hedra for Mn13 and a double icosahedra for Mn19. The
other geometries studied viz. hexagonal closed packed
and cuboctahedral structures for Mn13 and a fcc struc-
ture for Mn19 lie much higher in energy, 0.89 eV (9 µB),
1.12 eV (11 µB) and 1.53 eV (17 µB), respectively, than
their corresponding ground state.

In the Fig.6 we have depicted the magnetic moments
of the very closely lying isomers with their ground state
(see Table I) and while comparing those with the ex-
perimentally observed values, we come to the conclusion
that for a particular size of cluster, the isomers with
diﬀerent magnetic moments are likely to be present in
the SG cluster beam with a statistical weight and es-
sentially, the measured moment is the weighted aver-
age of those isomers. We calculate the energy diﬀer-
ence between the optimal FM and optimal ferrimagnetic
solutions, △E(Ferri−FM) = E(Ferri) − E(FM), and plot
them as a function of cluster size n in the Fig.7. For
both Mn3 and Mn4 the FM solutions are slightly lower
in energy than those of their respective optimal ferri-
magnetic solutions, whereas the optimal FM solutions
are slightly higher than the corresponding ferrimagnetic
ground states for Mn5 and Mn6. Thereafter, as the clus-
ter size increases, this energy diﬀerence, △E(Ferri−FM),
increases almost monotonically indicating that the opti-

mal FM solutions become more and more unlikely. All
these optimal FM states have ∼ 4 µB/atom magnetic
moments.

F. Coordination and the d-electron localization

The angular momentum projected local density of
states (LDOS) show interesting site dependency. The
s-, p- and d-projected LDOS for the central and surface
atoms are plotted in the Fig.8 for the Mn13 and Mn19
clusters. We see only d-projected LDOS are signiﬁcant
and are of great interest here. The d-projected LDOS
of both Mn13 and Mn19 for the central atoms are broad
for both majority and minority spin states, which are
also reﬂected through their small values of the integrated
spin densities M (1.42 and -1.41 µB for Mn13 and Mn19,
respectively). The broadening occurs due to the high
coordination of the central atom. On the other hand,
the d-projected LDOS of the surface atoms are rather lo-
calized and the majority spins are nearly fully occupied,
which is in agreement with the relatively large local mag-
netic moments of the surface atoms (3.60 and 3.44 µB for
Mn13 and Mn19 , respectively).

G. Spin gaps: Nonmetal − metal transition?

A spin arrangement in any magnetic clusters is mag-

netically stable only if both the spin gaps,

are positive, i.e. the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) of the majority spin lies above the highest occu-
pied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the minority spin and
vice versa. We ﬁnd these two spin gaps to be positive for
all the clusters (Table I) discussed here and are plotted
in the Fig.9. δ1 and δ2 have local structures, but gener-
ally decreases slowly as the coordination increases with
cluster size. Parks et al.
found that the Mnn clusters
with n ≤ 15 are not reactive towards molecular hydro-
gen, whereas they form stable hydrides at and above n =
16, and the reaction rate varies considerably with the
cluster size22. They argued it to be attributed from the
non-metal to metal transition at n = 16. If this is indeed
the reason, it is likely that the ionization potential would
show a signiﬁcant decrease at Mn16, similar to what has
been observed for free mercury clusters38. Therefore, we
expect closing up of the spin gaps at n = 16. How-
ever, Koretsky et al. observed no sudden decrease in the
measured ionization potential23 and we do not ﬁnd any
spin gap closing at Mn16 either. The spin gaps have rea-
sonable value, δ1 = 0.33 eV and δ2 = 0.22 eV for Mn16
cluster (Fig.9 and Table I). This abrupt change in the re-
action rate with H2 at Mn16 is not due to any structural
change either, as we ﬁnd all the medium sized clusters
adopt icosahedral growth pattern and the reason for the
observed change in the reaction rate remains unknown.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have systematically investigated the structural,
electronic and magnetic properties of Mnn (n = 2-20)

10

clusters from the ﬁrst-principles density functional the-
ory. An extensive search have been made to locate the
global minima. Due to the intrinsic 4s2 3d5 electronic
structure and high 4s23d5 → 4s13d6 promotion energy
Mn-atoms do not bind strongly when they come closer
to form a cluster. However, binding energy increases with
the cluster size as the coordination number increases and
reaches a value 2.37 eV/atom for Mn20, which is 81 % of
the bulk value. A magnetic transition from FM to fer-
rimagnetic ordering takes place at n = 5 and thereafter
the energy diﬀerence between the optimal ferrimagnetic
and optimal FM structure increases with the cluster size,
which indicates that the optimal FM states become more
and more unfavorable with increasing cluster size . How-
ever, diﬀerent ferrimagnetic states are possible within a
small ∼ 0.1 eV energy diﬀerence and their plausible pres-
ence in the experimental SG beam along with the ground
state has been argued. The predicted magnetic moments
are in agreement with the SG experiment. The sudden
decrease in the magnetic moment at n = 13 and 19 is
due to their ‘closed’ icosahedral structure. It should be
pointed out here that in the present calculation we as-
sumed only collinear alignment of spins. However, spin
canting or noncollinear magnetic ordering is possible in
small magnetic clusters as it occurs more easily in a low
symmetry magnetic system36.
Icosahedral growth pat-
tern is observed for the intermediate size range. However,
to our knowledge, a diﬀerent kind of icosahedral pack-
ing have been observed for Mn15 − Mn17 clusters.
In
any particular cluster, the average bond length between
antiferromagnetically aligned atoms are 3−8 % shorter
than that of the ferromagnetically alligned, which can be
explained in terms of the Pauli repulsion. Spin segre-
gation has been observed in the intermediate size range.
The d−electron localization strongly depends on coor-
dination:
localization decreases with the coordination
number. There is no signature of non-metal to metal
transition at n =16, which has been predicted22 through
the downward discontinuity observed in the reaction rate
with H2.

Abstract. We discuss the calculation of collective excitations in atomic clusters using
the time-dependent local density approximation. In principle there are many formula-
tions of the TDLDA, but we have found that a particularly eﬃcient method for large
clusters is to use a coordinate space mesh and the algorithms for the operators and the
evolution equations that had been developed for the nuclear time-dependent Hartree-
Fock theory. The TDLDA works remarkably well to describe the strong excitations
in alkali metal clusters and in carbon clusters. We show as an example the benzene
molecule, which has two strong features in its spectrum. The systematics of the linear
carbon chains is well reproduced, and may be understood in rather simple terms.

INTRODUCTION

The time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) is a powerful tool to
calculate the quantum mechanical motion of electrons in condensed matter systems.
In my talk I want to describe to you the numerical techniques we use [1], which
were borrowed from nuclear physics [2]. I then want to show you a survey of some
of the results, concluding with new work on the behavior of electrons in elongated
chains. The time-independent LDA is known as Density Functional Theory and
is well-established in condensed matter physics [3] as a predictive ab initio theory
that is practical for structures beyond the range of quantum chemistry methods
[4-7]. The equations of the LDA are easy to write down. The energy function is
given by the expression

density. The potentials included in the energy function are Vion, the ionic poten-
tial, e2/
, the direct Coulomb interaction between electrons, and vex(ρ), the
local-density approximation to the exchange-correlation energy. The static LDA
theory is obtained by minimizing this energy function, requiring only that the φi
be orthonormal. That gives the Kohn-Sham equations for the wave functions φi.
The TDLDA equations are very similar, with the “energy” (actually the Lagrange
multiplier) in the Kohn-Sham equation replaced by the time derivative i¯h∂t,

This is almost all I want to say in general. One always uses pseudopotentials for
the ions [8,9], to eliminate the core electrons with their large energy scales. The
LDA has well-known diﬃculties in describing the electronic excitations of systems,
attributable to the simpliﬁed treatment of exchange. However, the collective motion
is rather insensitive to the nonlocality of the exchange, and the TDLDA is much
more reliable than one would expect from looking at energy gaps.

II NUMERICAL

For most applications it is suﬃcient to consider small deviations from the static
solution, and then there are a number of approaches to solve the small-amplitude
TDLDA equations. Nuclear physicists are most familiar with the conﬁguration rep-
resentation, which I’ll just mention brieﬂy. Here one represents the time-dependent
wave function in the basis of the static solutions,

φi(t) = φi(0) +

aij(t)φj(0).

(3)

Xj

The equation of motion is Fourier transformed to frequency, and the matrix equa-
tions satisﬁed by the particle-hole amplitudes ˜aij(ω) are the RPA equations of
motion. This method becomes ineﬃcient for large systems, because the the di-
mensionality of the matrix grows as the product of the number of particle and
hole orbitals. In the more eﬃcient methods, the dimensionality increases linearly
with the number of particles. One method that is very popular is to calculate the

density-density response function. This is the density change induced at a point r
by a density perturbation at a point r′. Because of the local density approximation,
one can calculate the full response from the response of non-interacting electrons.
The number of mesh points to represent the response increases as the volume of
the system, and thus only linearly with the number of particles, making it more
eﬃcient for large systems. The method has been used extensively for systems with
spherical symmetry [10,11]; recently it has been applied also to clusters in three
dimensions [12].

We use another method whose dimensionality also scales linearly with the system
size. This is the straightforward solution of the time-dependent equations of motion.
The number of variables is the number of points at which wave function amplitudes
are represented. This can be of the order of 50,000 for some of the examples we
consider, so some care must be taken to use eﬃcient numerical algorithms. We
have simply adopted the technique of ref. [2] who investigated the TDHF theory of
nuclear dynamics.

We use a uniform mesh in coordinate space to represent the wave function. The
shape of the gridded volume can be spherical, cylindrical, or rectangular, depending
on the cluster under consideration. If the equations were linear in φ, they could
eﬃciently integrated by using the Taylor series expansion of the evolution operator,
iHt)φ = 1 + tHφ + t2H 2φ/2 + ... In practice we can ignore the change
φ(t) = exp(
of H dependence of H on φ for some small time interval τ , and use the Taylor series
integrator over that interval. We typically use fourth order:

(5)

Considerable care must be given to deﬁning the H to propagate in the above
equation. An important consideration is that the algorithm conserve energy to a
very high accuracy. This can be assured with an implicit deﬁnition of H in terms
of the densities ρ(t) and ρ(t + τ ) at the beginning and end of the interval τ . The
deﬁnition is

In practice we do not calculate this exactly but rather estimate the Hamiltonian at
t + τ /2 using a predictor-corrector method. In our algorithm, ﬁrst the potential is
extrapolated forward by half a time step with a 3-point diﬀerence formula to get a
trial potential Vtrial(t + τ /2). The time integration is then performed using Vtrial
to get a trial density ρtrial(t + τ ), and the density at time t + τ /2 is estimated as
ρ(t + τ /2) = (ρ(t) + ρtrial)/2. The potential obtained with this density is used to
once more integrate the wave function from t to t + τ .

To generate the response of the system, we perturb the ground state wave func-
tion and measure the response as a function of time. The initial wave functions are
taken as φi(~r, 0) = eikzφo
i represent the static Kohn-Sham solutions.

We are interested in the optical response, requiring the perturbing parameter k to

time evolution of the dipole moment is obtained as z(t) =
φi(t) >,
and its Fourier transform in time gives the dipole strength function.

Summarizing, our algorithm to integrate the TDLDA equations has as numerical
parameters the spatial mesh size, ∆x, the number of mesh points M, the time step
τ , and the total length of time integration T . The actual values for the diﬀerent
systems will be given below.

P

III PHYSICS

Our interest is in the electronic excitations, and we will leave aside completely
the problem of determining the ionic geometries of the clusters. In classical electro-
magnetic theory, the dipole strength in spherical metal clusters is concentrated in
the Mie resonance. The resonance may be sharp or not depending on the cluster,
and it may be present also in clusters of diﬀerent shapes.

A Alkali metals

The simple, sharp Mie resonance behavior is reproduced by jellium model of
alkali metal clusters [10], which however neglect the perturbing eﬀects of the ionic
cores.
It is therefore interesting to see to what extent the ionic cores aﬀect the
physics. I will ﬁrst consider a system where the jellium approximation is remarkably
good. This is the for clusters of sodium atoms. An example of a calculation is the
sodium cluster Na147. This was chosen because 147 atoms can be placed in a
icosahedral structure, which is as close a one can get to spherical structure with
discrete atoms. The numerical parameters of the calculation are: ∆x = 0.8 ˚A,
τ /¯h = 0.01 eV−1, M = 28000 and Nt = 5000. Because the valence electron is in an
s-wave, and the short-distance part of the wave function has been smoothed away
by the pseudopotential, a rather coarse ∆x is suﬃcient. The total time integration
is τ Nt/¯h = 50 eV−1 which in principle allows structures on the scale of 0.02 eV
to be resolved. Fig. 1 shows the response, compared with the spherical jellium
model. Both descriptions show a sharp peak at just over 3 eV excitation, and some
background extending in both directions. The two theories are quite close. This
shows that the pseudopotential in sodium has little eﬀect. Experimentally, sodium
clusters show a fairly sharp resonance, but the energy is lower by about 15%.

The next case, lithium, shows a more dramatic diﬀerence between the jellium
model and the full pseudopotential TDLDA. Fig. 2 shows the response of Li+
147,
comparing the full pseudopotential LDA with the jellium model. The Mie resonance
has been shifted down by the pseudopotential interactions and broadened. The
reason for the diﬀerence compared to sodium is not hard to ﬁnd [14]. The scattering
eﬀect of the pseudopotential is much larger in the case of Li, and the scattering
gives the electrons an eﬀective mass larger than one. In the jellium model the ion

behaves as a uniform positive charge density ﬁlling space within the lattice. The
scattering eﬀect of the pseudopotential may be seen by examining the scattering
from the diﬀerence between the pseudopotential and a uniform positive charge.

Thus, we are led to examine the scattering from the diﬀerence potential,

When we do this we ﬁnd that both the s- and p-wave scattering phase shifts for
sodium are small, showing that eﬀects of the pseudopotential are weak. On the
other hand, in the case of Li, the s-potential is repulsive but the p-wave potential is
attractive. This implies that there will be a large backward angle scattering, making
the single-particle wave functions rather diﬀerent than the jellium wave functions.
We believe this aspect is responsible for the broadening of the Mie resonance in Li.
Another consequence of the two potentials is that the eﬀective forward scattering
potential will be momentum-dependent, becoming more attractive as the momen-
tum increases and the amount of p-wave increases. This lowers the Mie resonance
frequency.

B Carbon structures

Carbon is more diﬃcult because the p-valence electrons are rather tightly bound
and require a ﬁner mesh. In practice, a mesh size of ∆x = 0.3 ˚A is adequate to
calculate the electronic response of carbon structures, given their geometry. As a
ﬁrst test, we examine the response of the benzene molecule, which has been well-
studied up to 30 eV with synchrotron photon sources [15,16]. For the calculation,
we used a pseudopotential for the hydrogen atoms as well as the carbon atoms,
and used the actual geometry of the molecule. The grid of mesh mesh points
was limited to points in a sphere of radius 7 ˚A. This requires about 50,000 mesh
points. Finally, because of the tighter binding of the p-waves, a time step a factor
of 10 smaller than that for the alkali metals was required, τ = 0.001 eV−1. The
resulting response is plotted in Fig. 3, showing the Fourier transform of the real-
time response computed over a time interval of 30 ¯h/eV. This is compared to the
strength function measured in ref. [15], which an adjusted normalization (which
was arbitrary in ref. [15]. The main features of the response are a sharp peak
at 6.9 eV, and a broad bump centered just below 20 eV. The sharp peak is very

electrons. The calculated strength of the resonance f is =1.1 in the usual sum rule
units (i.e. the eﬀective number of electrons). The experimental strength can be
extracted from the data of ref. [16], but the peak shape has wings that are not
simple Lorentzian tails. Including the right-hand wing up to 8.3 eV, but not the
left-hand shoulder, the measured strength is f = 0.9, which we consider rather
good agreement. The large broad bump is associated with the σ electrons. We
reproduce its gross structure. But note that the theoretical distribution has much
ﬁner structure than is observed experimentally.

[15].

Our next example is C60. Our TDLDA calculation is shown in Fig. 4, together
with another TDLDA calculation using the matrix RPA method [18]. In our cal-
culation, the π electron excitation appears as a single peak at 7 eV, carrying a
strength of f = 9. Experimentally, the π electron transitions are split into several
peaks, with a total strength up to 7 eV of f = 6. There are no absolute measure-
ments of the strength above 7 eV, but photoionization measurements exist [17] that
show a broad σ resonance, as in benzene. The (unnormalized) data is shown in the
ﬁgure with diamond symbols. The polarizability of C60 has some interest, because
the simpliﬁed tight-binding model gave a number much smaller than experiment,
85 ˚A3. The polarizability may

C Carbon chains

The important role of geometry in the dipole response is beautifully illustrated
by the collective π transition in carbon chains and rings. For these calculations
[19], we guessed at the geometry, ﬁxing the nearest neighbor distance at 1.28 ˚A for
all cases. This is the average LDA equilibrium distance for large rings or chains.
The atoms are in a line on the chains and form a circle on the rings. As in the

other examples, there is a strong collective π transition along the axis of the chain
or in the plane of the ring. The energies of the excitations are plotted in Fig. 5
as a function of the number of atoms. There is experimental data showing the
existence of excitations at the predicted energies for chains [20]. Unfortunately,
the strengths of the transitions were not measured, so it is not known whether the
observed transitions really correspond to the calculated collective excitations. The
stable form of carbon for cluster numbers greater than ten or so is believed to be
the ring conﬁguration, but no data is available on this form.

Notice that the excitation energies have a strong but smooth dependence on the
chain length. The variation is entirely explicable in terms of simple physics, not
requiring at all the detailed TDLDA calculations. This is the theme of the next
section of my talk.

IV COLLECTIVE ENERGETICS IN ATOMIC CHAINS

The behavior of electromagnetic resonances on inﬁnitely long wires is known from
classical electromagnetic theory. The dispersion formula for the one-dimensional
plasmon on a long wire reduces to the following expression in the long-wave length,
thin wire limit [23,24].

would have a q varying inversely with the length of the wire L. Thus the lowest
mode would behave as

(8)

(9)

This behavior can be extracted from a more quantum approach is the polariz-

ability estimate of the collective frequency [25],

where Ne is the number of active electrons and α is the polarizability. This formula
is derived from the ratio of sum rules, and Ne may be identiﬁed with the oscillator
strength f associated with the transition. For the linear carbon chains, the transi-
tion is associated with π electrons and and the number of them in the chain Cn (n
odd) is

The TDLDA calculations conﬁrm that this is satisﬁed at the level of 20% accuracy.
The polarizability is harder to estimate. In ref. [19] we model the polarizability
assuming that the chain acts as a perfectly conducting wire, of some ﬁxed trans-
verse dimension a and a long length L. Then one can show that for large L the
polarizability is given by

This is plotted in Fig. 6 as the solid line, ﬁtted to the TDLDA result at n = 14.
We see that the general trend is reproduced, but the asymptotic behavior is only
realized in long chains.

Another classical view is to compare with the polarizability of a conducting

ellipsoid, which can be calculated analytically [26]. The formula is

This has been applied to the longitudinal mode in fullerines [6].
Its asymptotic
behavior is given by eq. (10) above. Remarkably, this formula gives an excellent
ﬁt, treating the two parameters as adjustable. This is shown as the dashed curve
in Fig. 5.

We ﬁnally discuss the relative frequencies of the modes in chains and rings. One
expects that for Cn in the form of rings, the number of π electrons is 2n, roughly

the same as chains. However, the polarizability will be quite a bit smaller because
of the more compact geometry. The ratio of polarizabilities is about a factor of
two, giving a prediction of a 40% higher collective resonance. In fact the TDLDA
calculations shows that the sum rule f is also higher for ring conﬁgurations, and
the actual resonance is at about twice the energy of the chain. This may be seen
in Fig. 5.

V WHAT NEXT?

We have discussed carbon, but from a computational point of view the next
group IV element, silicon, would be very similar. The next challenge for numerical
TDLDA would be the group IB metals, the so-called coinage metals. These have
a single valence electron in an s shell, like the alkali metals, but there is a nearby
closed d shell that cannot be neglected in the response. Beyond that, there are all
d-shell metals which exhibit broad responses, hardly showing any trace of the Mie
resonance. But this remains for the for the future.

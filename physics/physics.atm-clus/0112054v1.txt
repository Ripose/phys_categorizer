In recent years, clusters and cluster-based materials
have been a ﬁeld of intensive research due to both funda-
mental and technological importance1–7. The structural,
electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of the clus-
ters are diﬀerent from those of constitute atoms or bulk
phase and depend sensitively on the size and composi-
tion of the cluster1–3.
It is desirable to assemble the
cluster-based materials from properly designed clusters
so that the unique properties of these individual clusters
can be retained6,7. To be a building block of cluster-
assembled materials, the cluster should be highly stable
and relatively unreactive. Thus, the clusters would inter-
act weakly with each other and maintain their identities
when they are brought together in the cluster-assembled
solids. A well-known example is the C60 solids8. Besides
C60, it has also been suggested that the metal clusters
with electronic and geometric shell structure can be used
to construct cluster-assembled materials6. In this direc-
tion, some previous theoretical eﬀorts have been devoted
to aluminum-based clusters6,7,9–13. First principles cal-
culations predicted that doping in the aluminum clusters
can enhance the stability of certain magic clusters like
Al13 and modify the physical and chemical properties of
the clusters9,11. The stability and electronic properties
of Al13K solid has also been calculated10.

Experimentally, particular attention has been paid to
pure and carbon-doped aluminum clusters. The mass
spectra of pure and doped Aln clusters have been ob-
tained by diﬀerent groups14–17. L.S.Wang et al. have
performed a combined photoelectron spectroscopy and ab
initio study on the small neutral and anionic aluminum-
carbon clusters AlnC− (n = 3 − 5)18–20. The reaction
of AlnC− clusters with oxygen was examined by Castle-
man’s group and Al7C− was found as a magic cluster21.

In this work, we shall investigate the structure and stabil-
ity of AlnC− clusters via a combination of experimental
cluster mass spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.

Our experimental apparatus consists of a standard
Smalley-type laser vaporization/molecular beam cluster
source, and a Wiley-McLaren time-of-ﬂight mass spec-
trometer (TOF MS)22. We use a Q-switched frequency
doubled Nd: YAG laser [532nm, 15ns full width at half
maximum (FWHM)] to vaporize the 6 mm graphite tar-
get rod. The aluminum target contains a trace amount
of carbon with C/Al ratio as 3×10−4. The laser spot on
the target is less than 1 mm and the typical laser output
is about 40 mJ. Pulsed He carrier gas stream (purity:
99.995%) generated from a pulsed valve is used to cool
down the plasma above the target that has been pro-
duced during the laser vaporization process. The clusters
synthesized in the nozzle channel will then be carried into
vacuum via supersonic expansion. The high pressure of
the He carrier gas is necessary for generating the anionic
Al−
n and AlnC− clusters in a mass range from n = 3
through n = 38. The clusters form a cluster beam af-
ter passing a skimmer (2 mm, Beam Dynamics) located
about 2 cm downstream from the nozzle exit.

The cluster mass abundance distribution is analyzed
by the Wiley-McLaren TOF MS driven with a negative
high voltage pulse generator (EG & G Model 1211, 100
ns rise time, -2 kV voltage). The extraction and accel-
eration regions of the TOF MS are 2 cm and 1 cm long
respectively. The length of the free-drift tube in the TOF
MS is 105 cm. An X-deﬂector is applied immediately af-
ter the acceleration region to compensate the transverse
energy of the ionized clusters. By adjusting the volt-
age exerted on the X-deﬂector, clusters in diﬀerent mass
ranges can be recorded. The clusters are detected by a
dual-microchannel plate (DMCP) and the signal from the
DMCP detector is fed into a LeCroy 9350AL digital oscil-
loscope (500 MHz bandwidth, 1GHz sampling rate and
2×2M maximum record length). Typically, each mass
spectrum is obtained by averaging 200 shots or more in
our experiments.

In this work, all electron density functional calcu-
lations on AlnC− (n=1-13) cluster anions have been
performed by using the DMol program23. A dou-
ble numerical basis including d-polarization function
(DND) are chosen. The density functional is treated
by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with
exchange-correlation potential parameterized by Wang
and Perdew24. Self-consistent ﬁeld calculations are done
with a convergence criterion of 10−6 a.u. on the total

energy and electron density. For each cluster size, we
started from a number of possible conﬁgurations and per-
form full geometry optimizations with Broyden-Fletcher-
Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. We use conver-
gence criterion of 10−3 a.u on the gradient and displace-
ment, and 10−5 a.u. on the total energy in the geometry
optimization. For the smaller clusters, diﬀerent possible
spin multiplicities are also tried.

The spectrum of cluster anions Al−

n and AlnC− in
Fig.1 covers the small cluster size ranging from n = 5
to n = 17. The spectrum is recorded when a helium
carrier gas stagnation pressure of 8 atm and a deﬂec-
tion voltage of 90 V exerted on the X-deﬂector are used.
One prominent feature in the spectrum is the well-known

13, which corresponds to a complete
icosahedral geometrical shell structure9 and a 2p elec-
tronic shell closing with the total number of valence elec-
trons ne = 401,2,16. In Fig.1, three sequential maximum
peaks centered at Al7C− are also found. For clarity, an

In this paper, we exploit the lowest energy structures of
the AlnC− (n = 1 − 13) by using density functional geo-
metrical minimization. The obtained ground state struc-
tures of AlnC− (n = 1 − 7, 8 − 13) are shown in Fig.4
and Fig.5 respectively. In general, the carbon atom is lo-
cated in the center of the equilibrium structure of AlnC−
clusters. The calculated cluster properties such as atom-
ization energy and HOMO-LUOM gap are described in
Table I. Our present results on the cluster energy diﬀer-
ence ∆En agree well with previous calculations13.

The ground state conﬁgurations and bond length pa-
rameters of the smaller AlnC− (n = 1 − 4) compare
well with previous calculations in Ref.[13] (Fig.4). Spin
triple state is found as ground state of AlC− and its
bond length is 1.89 ˚A, which agree well with previous
calculations13,28. The minimum energy structure found
for Al2C− is an isosceles triangle (C2v) with bond length

2

1.85 ˚A and apex angle θ = 110.6◦, in good agreement
with the 1.85 ˚A and 103 ◦ obtained from previous ab ini-
tio calculations13. The lowest energy structure of Al3C−
is a carbon-centered planar triangular structure with C-
Al bond length 1.91 ˚A , which is close to that of 1.90 ˚A in
previous studies13,18. For Al4C−, the lowest energy con-
ﬁguration is obtained as a carbon-centered planar trapez-
iform. The Al-C distances in Al4C− are 1.96 and 2.05 ˚A ,
This structure is consistent with that in Ref.[13] but dif-
ferent from the symmetric constraint calculation done by
L.S.Wang et al.19.

The low-energy structure of Al5C− can be considered
as being a distorted square pyramid face-capped by one
Al atom. This structure has been obtained as a local
minimum in previous study20. In our calculation, it is en-
ergetically lower than the equilibrium structure (a com-
pressed octahedron) found in Ref.[13] by 0.09 eV. The
low-energy structure for Al6C− can be constructed by
face-capping one more aluminum atom on the conﬁgu-
ration of Al5C− in Fig.4. However, a carbon-centered
triangular prism was found as ground state structure in
Ref.[13]. The energy diﬀerence between these two iso-

Al7C−, we ﬁnd a central carbon surrounded by a seven-
atom aluminum cage, in complete agreement with previ-
ous work13. Thus, the particular low reactivity of Al7C−
against oxygen21 can be partially understood by the close
aluminum cage, which can protected the high reactive
carbon site from approaching O2 molecules.

As shown in Fig.5, the low-energy structures of Al8C−
are based on face-capping of one Al atom on the Al7C−
cage, which agree with previous calculations13. The
structure for Al9C− can be viewed as a carbon-centered
octahedron edge-capped by three atoms.
Similar to
Al8C−, the low-energy structures of Al10C− can be con-
structed by face-capping of three aluminum atoms on
the cage-like structure of Al7C−. Starting from n = 11,
the equilibrium conﬁgurations of AlnC− switch to the
icosahedron-based packing. Al11C− is a truncated icosa-
hedron with slight distortion. Al12C− is a perfect carbon-
centered icosahedron with C-Al distance as 2.56 ˚A . The
equilibrium structure of Al13C− is a distorted carbon-
centered icosahedron capped by one Al atom.

In Fig.6, we plot the second diﬀerences of cluster
energies deﬁned by ∆2E(n) = AE(n + 1) + AE(n −
1) − 2AE(n), where AE(n) is the atomization energy
of AlnC− clusters from DFT calculations.
In cluster
physics, the ∆2E(n) is a sensitive quantity that reﬂect
the stability of clusters and can be directly compared to
the experimental relative abundance. In Fig.6, a global

obtained. The present theoretical results are consistent
with our experiment and previous works quite well15,21.
In addition to the most pronounced peak at Al7C−,
our experimental mass spectrum in Fig.1 also show a

experiments21.

From our experimental and theoretical investigation,
Al7C− is always obtained as a magic cluster with pro-
nounced high stability among the anionic AlnC− clus-
ters. In addition to the maximum on the size dependent
cluster energy diﬀerence, ∆En or ∆2E(n), Al7C− also
possess a HOMO-LUMO gap of 1.72 eV larger than its
neighboring clusters (Table I). Such large gap should have
certain contribution to the low reactivity upon oxygen.
The particular stability of the Al7C− could be useful in
construct cluster-based materials. For example, it might
be possible to assemble Al7C− with alkali metal ions to
form stable solid. The further calculations on this direc-
tion is still under way and the results will be described
elsewhere.

In summary, we have performed both experimental
and computational studies on AlnC− clusters. Experi-
mental mass spectrum on Al−
n show the standard magic
−
−
number at Al
13 and Al
23 due to electron shell closing.
Among those anionic AlnC− clusters, Al7C− is found to
be particularly stable. The ground state structures of the
AlnC− (n = 1 − 13) clusters are determined from density
functional optimizations. Theoretical calculations also
demonstrate the high stability of Al7C−, which might be
attributed to the stable aluminum cage and large elec-
tronic gap. We suggest that the magic Al7C− cluster
could be building blocks of future cluster-assembled ma-
terials.

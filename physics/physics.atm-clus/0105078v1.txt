Photoabsorption cross sections of small sodium cluster cations (Na+

n , n=3,5,7 and 9) were cal-
culated at various temperatures with the time-dependent local-density-approximation (TDLDA)
in conjunction with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, yielding spectra that agree with
measured ones without ad-hoc line broadening or renormalization. Three thermal line-broadening
mechanisms are revealed: (I) lifting of level degeneracies caused by symmetry-breaking ionic mo-
tions, (II) oscillatory shifts of the entire spectrum caused by breathing vibrations, and (III) cluster
structural isomerizations.

Optical spectroscopy provides invaluable insights into
ionic conﬁgurations, thermal
the electronic structure,
processes and dynamics in metal clusters, as well as
about the size-dependent evolution of these properties.
Indeed, investigations of these issues have been pursued
rather intensively for over a decade both experimentally
with photodepletion spectroscopy1,2 and theoretically3–9
with the main methodology employing the TDLDA3,5,10
in conjunction with either jellium models3–5 (including
allowance for shape-deformations) where the ionic back-
ground is smeared out uniformly, or with electronic struc-
ture calculations of various degree of sophistication where
the discrete nature of the ions is incorporated accu-
rately7,8 or perturbatively9. While valuable information
pertaining to the optical excitations and damping mech-
anisms in metal clusters has been obtained through such
studies, including the sensitivity of optical features to
cluster geometries, a ﬁrst-principles theoretical descrip-
tion of the optical line-shapes, the absolute absorption
cross-sections, the relevant microscopic line-broadening
mechanisms and their thermal variations, is lacking. This
is reﬂected in the common ad-hoc employment of line
broadening through convolution of spectral lines calcu-
lated for selected static cluster conﬁgurations with Gaus-
sian or Lorentzian functions3–5,7,8, or (multiplicative)
renormalization of the calculated spectra to the measured
ones9,11.

In this letter, we demonstrate that photoabsorption
cross sections, σ(ω), calculated via the TDLDA along
ﬁnite-temperature Born-Oppenheimer (BO) local-spin-
density (LSD) molecular dynamics (MD) (BO-LSD-
MD12) phase-space trajectories, provide a quantitative
ab-initio description of the absolute magnitudes, peak po-
sitions, and line shapes of optical absorption spectra mea-
sured at various temperatures from Na+
n (n=3, 5, 7 and
9) clusters2. Furthermore, analyses of the results, and
in particular the temporal correlations between the cal-
culated σt(ω) (where the superscript denotes the value
at instant t) and the dynamically evolving cluster con-
ﬁgurations, reveal three thermally induced mechanisms

which govern the spectral characteristics: (I) symmetry
breaking of the optimal (0 K) cluster geometries due to
thermal motion of the ions, leading to lifting of electronic
level degeneracies and resulting in splitting (fragmenta-
tion) of spectral lines; (II) symmetry conserving breath-
ing motions that modulate the eﬀective density, result-
ing in oscillatory frequency shifts of the entire spectrum
(”spectral sweeping”) that inﬂuence the optical absorp-
tion peak positions and line width; (III) opening of the
accessible conﬁgurational space, resulting in structural
isomerization and consequent electronic structure and
spectral variations. The ﬁrst two mechanisms are opera-
tive for smaller clusters (Na+
5 ) even at relatively
low temperatures (e.g. 100 K), while all three occur for
the larger ones. Furthermore, the thermal dependence
of the spectral characteristics is analyzed, resulting in
remarkable ﬁrst-principles agreement between the calcu-
lated and measured optical absorption cross sections.

3 and Na+

The Kohn-Sham (KS) equations with generalized gra-
dient corrections (GGA)13 and non-local pseudopoten-
tials14 were solved for Na+
n clusters (n=3, 5, 7, and 9),
and based on the Hellman-Feynman forces, ﬁnite temper-
ature trajectories were generated by Langevin dynam-
ics through the use of the BO-LSD-MD (with GGA)
method12. For each cluster size, starting from the (pre-
sumed7) GGA-optimized ground state (GS) geometry
and an equilibration of 10 ps duration, the system was
allowed to evolve dynamically at the prescribed tempera-
ture for an additional period of ts=10 ps. At each instant
t, the excitation energies ωt
I were determined by solving
the TDLDA eigenvalue problem10

The calculated Na+

We note ﬁrst the overall good agreement between the
magnitudes and shapes of the calculated and measured
photoabsorption cross sections (shown here for Na+
n ,
n=3,5 and 9); compare the red histograms with the black
curves in Fig. 1, and note that neither (artiﬁcial) numer-
ical broadening nor a renormalization of the spectra has
been applied. The slight deviations in peak positions are
within the known accuracy of the TDLDA (±0.2 eV)10.
3 spectrum at T ≈100 K (Fig. 1a)
exhibits a low energy peak originating16 from two transi-
tions ωt
2≈2.65 eV, from the occupied s-like orbital to
two empty p-like KS orbitals located in the plane of the
Na+
3 equilateral triangle (see grey insets 1, 2 and 3 at the
left of Fig. 1a). The high energy peak at ωt
3=3.41 eV is
due to an excitation to another p-like orbital that is per-
pendicular to the cluster plane (grey inset 4 in Fig. 1a).
In the experiments σ(ω) is determined from the deple-
tion of the Na+
n intensity due to dissociation following
absorption of a photon ¯hω. Excitation into the in-plane
anti-bonding orbitals (insets 2 and 3) promotes such dis-
sociation and is accompanied by exhaustion of the OS for
the ﬁrst (lower energy) measured peak. Excitation into
the out-of-plane orbital (inset 4) has no direct destabi-
lizing eﬀect and consequently in the measurements only
66% of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule (TRK)10 is
observed while the full TRK sum rule is found in the
theoretical spectrum shown in Fig. 1a (as well as in all
the calculated spectra that we show here).

spheres mark the position of the ions. The right top cor-
ner insets in (b-e) show static TDLDA spectra: (b) for the
Na+

derives exclusively from conﬁgurations lying in the basin of
the GS structure α whose oblate spheroidal electron density
is depicted by the purple isosurface. The static spectrum of
α is shown at the top inset in (d), and in the bottom inset
we show the decomposition of that spectrum into the com-
ponent along the z-axis (green sticks) and the perpendicu-
lar components (red sticks). The Na+
9 isomer β is shown in

static spectrum (right top inset). To highlight the sensitivity
of the experimental results to the temperature, we include in

tions of the cluster (density oscillations, mechanism II).
Similarly, the ﬁnite temperature dynamics of Na+
5 dis-
torts (even at T =100 K) the optimal D2d GS symme-
try (see GS α in Fig. 1b where the perpendicular left
and right triangles are equivalent, and compare to the
instantaneous structure β shown in Fig. 1b with an elon-
gated left triangle), resulting in fragmentation (I) of the
GS line at ω= 2.8 eV into two separate spectral lines ωu
17 (compare red and blue lines in the up-right
and ωd
inset of Fig. 2b). Consequently, the temporal variation
of the absolute diﬀerence of the average bond lengths in
the left and the right triangle (∆t
r|, serving as a
measure of the thermal structural distortion) correlates
directly with the spacing δt
d between the fre-
quencies of the spectral fragments (see solid and dashed
curve in Fig. 2c).

While the relatively moderate structural distortions
occurring at 100 K are not suﬃcient to lift the degeneracy
of the states associated with the low energy absorption
line of Na+
5 (at ∼2 eV, compare insets α and β at the
upper right of Fig. 1b) which remains relatively sharp,
increase of the temperature to 300 K results in bent con-
ﬁgurations (see instantaneous structure γ on the left in
Fig. 1c) where the low energy line is fragmented (see
inset γ at the upper right of Fig. 1c), resulting in en-
hanced broadening of that spectral line (compare Figs.
1b and 1c). Further broadening of the lines is caused by
the aforementioned breathing modes (spectral sweeping

the interionic Coulomb repulsion Et

of the ionic density) and the average excitation energy

For larger clusters, the occurrence of thermal

iso-
merizations opens an additional line-broadening channel
(III)18. The GS structure of the Na+
9 cluster19 is shown at
the left of Fig. 1d (marked α) and the TDLDA spectrum
calculated for this static conﬁguration exhibits several
absorption lines distributed in a bimodal-like manner (see
top inset at the upper right of Fig. 1d). This bimodality,
which is in contradiction to the single-line spectrum pre-
dicted by the jellium model5, originates from the ”oblate
shape” of the cluster with radii Rz=2.68 ˚A along the D3h
symmetry axis (z in Fig. 1d) and Rxy=3.22 ˚A in the xy
plane (these radii were determined from the diagonalized
moment of inertia of the ionic GS structure α). The to-
tal electron density (see purple isosurface in Fig. 1d) is
almost an ideal oblate spheroid. A decomposition of the
OS of the D3h GS into a z (ν=3 term in eq. 1) and the xy
contribution (ν=1 and 2 terms) shows clearly that, as ex-
pected3, the smaller spatial dimension in the z direction
is associated with a higher excitation energy (compare
green and red line in bottom inset at the upper right of
Fig. 1d). The bimodal character of the 100 K photoab-
sorption spectrum is evident in both the measured and
calculated spectra (Fig. 1d), with further broadening
caused by thermal motions through line-fragmentation

and breathing vibrations of the cluster (mechanisms I
and II).

The main thermal eﬀect observed in the spectra of Na+
9
is the conversion of the low temperature (e.g. T =100 K,
Fig. 1d) bimodal spectrum to one with a single broad
maximum at higher temperatures (e.g. 450 K, Fig. 1e).
This change in the spectrum is caused mainly by trans-
formations between the GS geometry (α, Fig. 1d) and
the structural isomer β (see conﬁguration on the left
of Fig. 1e). The static spectrum of the β isomer is
shifted to lower energies with respect to that of the GS
(α) structure (compare top insets marked α and β at
the upper right corners of Figs. 1d and 1e). Thus, the
high-temperature broad spectral feature (Fig. 1e) is due
to contributions from both the α and β isomers to the
phase-space trajectories generated by the Langevin MD
simulation at 450 K20,21.

The β-isomer may be characterized as having an oc-
tupolar shape, reﬂected in the shape of the electron den-
sity shown in Fig. 1e (see purple isosurface). To quanti-
tatively analyze the spectral broadening caused by tran-
sitions (at high T) between the GS (α) and the β-isomer

ℓ=5 and the width Γt of the spec-
see ref.23) between ∆t
trum at time t (Γt is twice the standard deviation of
σt(ω) for 2 ≤ ω ≤ 3.5 eV). Furthermore, including in
such analysis only quadrupole and octupole deformations
(i.e. ∆t
ℓ=3) results in a similar high value of R2(73 %),
while limiting consideration to the quadrupole deforma-
tion alone (i.e. ∆t
ℓ=2) yields a poor correlation (R2=19
%) pointing to the strong inﬂuence of octupolar defor-
mations on the optical response of metal clusters (even
closed shell ones i.e. Na+
9 ). This analysis conﬁrms our
conclusion pertaining to the importance of the isomeriza-
tion mechanism (III) in explaining the thermal evolution
of photoabsorption spectra (particularly at high temper-
atures).

In summary, we demonstrated that calculations of ab-
solute photoabsorption cross sections using the TDLDA
in conjunction with ab initio MD simulations allow ﬁrst-
principles quantitative description and interpretation of
optical spectra measured for sodium cations at various
temperatures. Spectral line fragmentation resulting from
symmetry-breaking ionic motions that lift electronic level
degeneracies, frequency shifts (spectral sweeps) of the en-
tire spectrum due to symmetry-conserving breathing vi-
brations, and structural isomerizations are identiﬁed as
the main thermal line-broadening mechanisms with the
ﬁrst two operative for the smaller cluster (Na+
3 and Na+
5 )
and all three for larger ones.

3 and Na+

16 For the smallest clusters (Na+

5 ) an analysis of
the largest elements in FI,ij (see eq. 1 and ref.10) allows
assignment of the particular particle-hole pairs (i, j) that
make a dominant contribution to a certain optical line I.
Such analysis is not fruitful for larger clusters whose level
spectra are more dense.

17 The OS of the Na+

5 2.77 eV line stems mainly from the
transition from the ﬁrst occupied orbital (with an elongated
s-like shape) to two degenerate orbitals spatially separated
on one of the two triangles.

18 While in the text we focus our discussion on the larger
cluster Na+
9 , we remark that isomerization broadening was
found by us also for sodium Na+
7 , where at T =300 K we ob-
served structural transitions between the D5h pentagonal
bipyramidal GS and a D6h planar hexagonal isomer (ly-
ing 141 meV above the GS) resulting in a bimodal spectral
maximum for ω∼ 2.4 eV, in addition to a broad absorption
peak at 3.5 eV (see ref.2).

19 The Na+

9 GS structure (a tricapped trigonal prism, α in
Fig. 1d) is lower by 98 meV than the Na+
9 GS reported in
ref.7 and depicted as conﬁguration β on the left of Fig. 1e
(a bicapped bipyramide with a C2v symmetry).

20 We note that attempts to describe the simulated 450 K
spectrum shown in Fig. 1e by Boltzmann-weighted averag-
ing of the broadened static 0 K spectra of the α and β iso-
mers (insets in Figs. 1d and 1e) do not lead to satisfactory
agreement with our ab-initio results and the experimen-
tal data, unless unphysically large broadening parameters
are used. Furthermore, this procedure fails to describe the
observed shift of the high-temperature spectrum to lower
energies due to thermal expansion of the cluster.

21 From our simulations of Na+

9 at 450 K, we observed a
direct correlation between the ionic repulsion energy and
the mean absorption frequency (similar to that shown in
Fig. 2d for Na+
5 ). The line broadening due to the breath-
ing mode (mechanism II) implied by such correlation, con-
tributes merely 66 meV to the total width (∼0.6 eV, see
Fig. 1e).

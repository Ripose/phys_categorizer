Summary

Symmetry adaptation techniques are applied to the determination of intensi-

ties of intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions for transition-metal ions in cu-

bical symmetry. This leads to a simple model giving the polarization dependence

of intensities of two-photon (electric dipolar) transitions between Stark levels of the
conﬁguration 3dN (N = even or odd).

1. Introduction

With the availability of tunable dye lasers, two-photon spectroscopy of transi-

tion ions in molecular or solid-state environments (generic symmetry G) has been the

object of numerous developments both from an experimental and theoretical view-

point [1-23]. Indeed, two-photon spectroscopy turns out to be a useful complement

to one-photon spectroscopy because it allows levels to be reached which cannot be

seen in one-photon spectroscopy [1-13]. There are now many two-photon absorption

spectra published for rare-earth ions (generic conﬁguration 4f N for the lanthanides

or 5f N for the actinides) in various surroundings. In this respect, to name but a few

recently published studies, let us mention Gd3+ (N = 7) in Gd(OH)3 (G = D3h)

[14,15], in GdCl3 (G = C3h) [14] and in the cubic elpasolite Cs2NaGdCl6 (G = Oh)
[16] ; Sm2+ (N = 6) in BaClF (G = C4v) [17,18] and in SrClF (G = C4v) [19] ;
and, ﬁnally, Eu3+ (N = 6) in LuPO4 (G = D2d) [19]. Transition-metal ions of the
iron series (generic conﬁguration 3dN ) in crystals have also been the object of recent

investigations. For example, the case of Ni2+ (N = 8) in MgO (G = O) has received

a great deal of attention in the last three years [20,21,22]. Furthermore, there are

also some data about Co2+ (N = 7) in KZnF3 (G = O) [23].

It is the aim of the present paper to report on a simple model for describing

3dN → 3dN intra-conﬁgurational two-photon transitions for a transition-metal ion

in an environment of cubical (octahedral) symmetry (G = O or Oh). The main

ingredients of the model (symmetry adapted wave-functions and second- plus third-

order mechanisms) are given in section 2 with necessary formulas for application

listed in section 3.

2. Theory

Let us consider a (parity-allowed) two-photon transition between an initial state
i, of symmetry Γ, and a ﬁnal state f , of symmetry Γ′, of the conﬁguration 3dN ; the
labels Γ and Γ′ stand for irreducible representations of the group O or its double group

2

O∗ according to whether the number N of 3d electrons is even or odd, respectively.
The corresponding state vectors are denoted |3dN iΓγ) and |3dN f Γ′γ′) where γ and γ′
distinguish the various partners for Γ and Γ′. These vectors can be expressed either in
a strong-ﬁeld basis of type |tN−M
(S1Γ1)eM (S2Γ2)ST ΓT βΓγ) or in a weak-ﬁeld basis
of type |3dN αSLJaΓγ). We shall adopt here a weak-ﬁeld approach. (The weak- and

2

strong-ﬁeld approaches are equivalent inso far as we use the same time-independent

Hamiltonian Hi+e for the ion in its environment [24] in both approaches.)

We have chosen to calculate the transition matrix element Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) within

the following approximations : (i) We use single-mode excitations (energy ¯hωλ, wave-
vector ~kλ, polarization ~Eλ) of the radiation ﬁeld and we suppose the two photons

(λ = 1, 2) to be identical. (In fact, most of the experiments achieved up to now

use a single laser beam.)

(ii) We use a time-dependent Hamiltonian of the type

Hi+e + Hrf + Hint for describing the system formed by the ion in its environment

(Hi+e) and the radiation ﬁeld (Hrf ) which interact through Hint and we treat Hint

in the framework of the electric dipolar approximation. (iii) We use a quasi-closure

approximation to deal with the G¨oppert-Mayer formula for two-photon processes.

As a result, the transition matrix element can be calculated to be [1,5,6]

Mi(Γγ)→f (Γ′γ′) = (3dN f Γ

′γ′

|Hef f |3dN iΓγ)

where the eﬀective operator Hef f reads [10]

Hef f =

X
k=0,2

X
kS kL

C [(kSkL) k] (cid:16){E E}(k) . W(kS kL)k

(cid:17)

The term {E E}(k) is the tensor product of rank k of the polarization unit vectors

E for the two photons. The dependence on the ion appears in the electronic double

tensor W(kS kL)k of spin rank kS, orbital rank kL and total rank k. Furthermore,

the C [(kSkL) k] parameters are expansion coeﬃcients which may be calculated from

ﬁrst principles. The contributions (kS = 0, kL = 2, k = 2) and (kS 6= 0, kL, k)

correspond to the standard second-order mechanisms [1-4] and to the so-called third-

order mechanisms (which may take into account ligand, crystal-ﬁeld and spin-orbit

eﬀects) [5-9], respectively.

and 25. We thus obtain

where the I parameters, which bear the dependence on the ion in its environment,

have been derived in the weak-ﬁeld coupling scheme [11-13,22]. These intensity pa-

rameters depend on the wave-functions used for the initial and ﬁnal states, on the

atomic parameters C [(kSkL) k], on atomic reduced matrix elements and on isoscalar
factors for the chains of groups SO(3) ⊃ O (for N even) or SU (2) ⊃ O∗ (for N

odd). The number of independent parameters I is controlled by a set of properties

and rules [11-13]. For the purpose of this paper, it is suﬃcient to note that the sum
over Γ′′ is limited by the selection rule : Γ′′ is of the type A1, E or T2 and must be
contained in the representation Γ′∗ ⊗ Γ of the octahedral group O. In addition, the

polarization dependence is completely contained in the factors of type {E E}.

3. Application

By applying the above-mentioned selection rule, we can rewrite SΓ→Γ′ as

where the functions ̟i (i = 1, 2, 3) can be readily derived by means of Wigner-Racah

calculus for the chain of groups SO(3) ⊃ O [24,25]. As a matter of fact, we obtain

(θ, ϕ) are the polar angles of the polarization vector ~E with respect to the crys-
tallographic axis and, for circular polarization, the wave-vector ~k is parallel to the

crystallographic axis. (Of course, the angular functions ̟i (i = 1, 2, 3) do not de-
pend on the labels γ′′, i.e., on the chain SO(3) ⊃ G=O ⊃ G′ ⊃ G′′ used in practical

computations.)

We give below the intensities SΓ→Γ′ for N even (Γ and Γ′ belong to O) and for
N odd (Γ and Γ′ belong to O∗). To pass from SΓ→Γ′ to SΓ′→Γ, it is suﬃcient to
change ΓΓ′ into Γ′Γ in the intensity parameters I. For N even, the results are the

The intensity formulas given above cover all the possible ground states encoun-

tered for transition-metal ions in cubical symmetry. We note that

SA1→A1 = SA2→A2 = SΓ6→Γ6 = SΓ7→Γ7 = 0

when the scalar contribution (characterized by I[00A1; ΓΓ]) to the third-order mech-

anisms is not taken into consideration. Therefore, the observation, if any, of the

latter transitions would prove the relevance of third-order mechanisms. In particu-

lar, it would be interesting to test the importance of the third-order mechanisms in

the case of an ion with conﬁguration 3d5 (like Mn2+).

The expression of the intensity parameters I has been described in section 2 in

the weak-ﬁeld coupling scheme. (They can be equally well expressed in the strong-

ﬁeld coupling scheme.) There are three ways to deal with the I parameters. First,

they may be considered as phenomenological parameters to be ajusted on experi-

mental data. Second, they may be calculated from ﬁrst principles. We then need to

diagonalize-optimize the matrix of Hi+e (as done, for instance, in ref. 26 for Eu3+

in ﬁfteen compounds of interest in solid-state chemistry) and to calculate isoscalar

factors, reduced matrix elements and parameters characterizing second- and/or third-

order mechanisms. Third, they may be handled in a mixed (semi-phenomenological)

way, especially if we want to reduce the number of I parameters.

As an illustration, let us consider the case of Ni2+ in MgO. The two-photon

transitions from the initial state i = 3A2(T2) with Γ = T2 to the ﬁnal states f =
3T2(E) with Γ′ = E and f = 3T2(T1) with Γ′ = T1 have been recently observed for
various linear polarizations [20-21]. The specialization to the conﬁguration 3d8 of the

model described here allows computation in an ab initio way of the intensity ratios

R1 and R2 deﬁned in ref. 21. The theoretical values are R1 = 0.95 and R2 = 1.04,

to be compared with the experimental values R1 = 1.5−3 and R2 = 1.1 [22].

4. Conclusion

In this paper we have concentrated on the intensities of two-photon transitions

for 3dN ions in octahedral symmetry. The model discussed in section 2 is valid

for any strength of the crystal-ﬁeld interaction. Therefore, the results of sections 2

and 3 can be extended mutatis mutandis to any ndN conﬁguration (n = 4 for the

palladium series and n = 5 for the platinum series). They can be also applied to

tetrahedral symmetry in view of the isomorphism of O and Td. Finally, the results

given here concern one-color transitions. The extension to two-color transitions (using

two diﬀerent beams) is straightforward.

A particular version of the model presented in this paper has been successfully

applied to Ni2+ in MgO ; the main results have been discussed at REMCES V and

will be published elsewhere in greater detail [22]. The model will be applied to some

other experimental data (e.g., Co2+ in KZnF3 [23]) in the thesis by one of us (M. D.)

and in forthcoming papers.

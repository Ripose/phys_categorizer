Long range intermolecular forces in triatomic systems:
connecting the atom-diatom and atom-atom-atom representations

Marko T. Cvitaˇs, Pavel Sold´an and Jeremy M. Hutson

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The long-range forces that act between three atoms are analysed in both atom-diatom and atom-
atom-atom representations. Expressions for atom-diatom dispersion coeﬃcients are obtained in
terms of 3-body nonadditive coeﬃcients. The anisotropy of atom-diatom C6 dispersion coeﬃcients
arises primarily from nonadditive triple-dipole and quadruple-dipole forces, while pairwise-additive
forces and nonadditive triple-dipole and dipole-dipole-quadrupole forces contribute signiﬁcantly to
atom-diatom C8 coeﬃcients. The resulting expressions are applied to dispersion coeﬃcients for Li +
Li2 (triplet) and recommendations are made for the best way to obtain global triatomic potentials
that dissociate correctly both to three separated atoms and to an atom and a diatomic molecule.

INTRODUCTION

ATOM-DIATOM LIMIT

There is great current interest in forming diatomic
molecules in cold gases of alkali metal atoms, by photoas-
sociation spectroscopy [1, 2, 3, 4], by magnetic tuning
through atom-atom Feshbach resonances [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
and through 3-body recombination [10, 11].
In most
current experiments, the diatomic molecules are formed
in vibrational states near dissociation and spend most
of their time at large internuclear separations. Once
formed, the fate of the molecules depends on collisional
processes which in turn depend on atom-atom and atom-
diatom potential energy surfaces [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

The potential energy surfaces for alkali metal trimers
are strongly nonadditive, even for spin-polarized atoms
(quartet electronic states) [18, 19]. In all cases both linear
and equilateral conﬁgurations of the M3 collision complex
lie below the asymptotic atom-diatom energy, so that
barrierless atom exchange reactions can occur. We have
carried out quantum dynamics calculations including re-
active channels for spin-polarized Na + Na2 [12], Li + Li2
[14, 16, 17] and K + K2 [15]. In Na + Na2, nonadditivity
increases the well depth by about 60% [18] and increases
the low-energy cross sections for vibrational quenching by
a factor of 10 [12]. For the other alkali metals the nonad-
ditive contributions to the potential are even larger [19].

Low-energy collisions are particularly sensitive to long-
range potentials.
In developing triatomic potential en-
ergy surfaces for collision calculations, it is thus highly
desirable to use global functional forms that include non-
additivity and have the correct physical behaviour both
for three-body dissociation (to separated atoms) and
for two-body dissociation (to an atom and a diatomic
molecule). However, although there has been a consider-
able amount of work on both these limits, the connection
between them has not been fully explored. This paper
sets out to establish the connection and to suggest func-
tional forms that are correct in both limits.

An atom-diatom system is conveniently described in
terms of Jacobi coordinates R, r and θ. In this case, “long
range” is usually interpreted to mean that the atom-
diatom distance R is large but that the diatom internal
distance r can be either large or small. For an atom inter-
acting with a homonuclear diatom the long-range forces
for R ≫ r (neglecting retardation and damping) can be
written to order R−10 [20],

and Na2. They ﬁtted the results to empirical func-
tional forms based on the known asymptotic behaviour
of diatomic polarizabilities [22]. However, they stated
that the proper asymptotic functional form for atom-
diatom dispersion coeﬃcients was unknown. M´erawa et
al.
[23] extended parts of this work (not including the
r-dependence of the dispersion coeﬃcients) to systems
containing K and triplet K2.

SEPARATED ATOM LIMIT

A system of three well-separated atoms is more con-
veniently described in terms of atom-atom distances r12,

r23 and r31 and the angles φ1, φ2 and φ3 measured at
each atom. The interaction energy for such a system is
conventionally represented in terms of pairwise additive
and nonadditive terms,

V (r) =

Vdimer(rij ) + V3(r),

The nonadditive energy has several long-range contribu-
tions that need careful consideration. The best-known
is the Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM) triple-dipole (DDD)
term, which has the form [24]

The triple-dipole term is one of several that arise in third-
order perturbation theory from terms of the type

The interaction Hamiltonian H ′
ij is usually expanded at
long range in terms of multipole-multipole interactions.
The triple-dipole term arises when each of the three op-
erators H ′

ij is a dipole-dipole interaction of the form

where ˆrij is a unit vector along rij. The triple-dipole
term will be referred to below as a third-order (3,3,3)
contribution to indicate the powers of the three distances
involved.

There are additional third-order terms that arise when
one or more of the dipole operators is replaced by a
quadrupole or higher-order moment. The low-order
terms and their resulting contributions for 3 identical
atoms are [25, 26]

where c.p. indicates summation of all cyclic permutations of indices. It may be noted that the multipole operator on
each atom appears in two terms in Eq. (7), so that changing one dipole operator into a higher-order one aﬀects two
of the inverse powers.

In addition to these third-order terms, there are terms arising from fourth and higher-order perturbation theory that
make important contributions to the long-range atom-diatom coeﬃcients. In principle, any combination of interaction
operators could produce a 4th-order term, although only those that involve excitations on all three atoms produce
a contribution to the 3-body nonadditive energy. In addition, any odd-order operators (dipoles and octopoles) must

In addition, there are fourth-order terms like Eq. (18)
but with one pair of the dipole-dipole operators replaced
with dipole-quadrupole operators. These give terms with
powers (8, 6, 0), (8, 3, 3), (7, 7, 0), (7, 4, 3) and (6, 4, 4).
The angular factors have been given to within overall
scaling factors by Lotrich and Szalewicz [29] (though
the (6, 3, 3) term that they describe is in fact zero and
there are several typographical errors in their equations).
There is also a fourth-order term involving a single
octopole-dipole operator (with all the rest dipole-dipole)
that also contributes to (8, 6, 0) but is not mentioned in
ref. 29.

There are also analogous terms arising from ﬁfth-order
perturbation theory, which are also constrained by the
requirement that odd-order operators must occur an even
number of times for each atom. The leading such term
(DDDDD) has powers (9,3,3), but its explicit angular
form has not been given previously. We have evaluated

it within the Drude model of ref. 27. We adopt the
deﬁnition Z11111 = (35/256)V α5, which corresponds to

CONNECTING THE ATOM-DIATOM AND
SEPARATED ATOM LIMITS

To make an explicit connection between the atom-atom
additive and nonadditive dispersion terms and the atom-
diatom dispersion formulae (2), we must collect terms in
the (r12, r23, r31) representation that contribute to indi-
vidual powers of the Jacobi distance R. Let us consider
the case in which a diatom made up of atoms 1 and 2
is separated from atom 3. For simplicity, we will assume
that the three atoms are identical. The atom-atom dis-
tances may be written in terms of Jacobi coordinates R,
r and θ,

r12 = r

r23 = rR2 +

+ Rr cos θ;

r31 = rR2 +

− Rr cos θ,

r2

(28)

(29)

(30)

and the cosines of φ1, φ2 and φ3 are given by the cosine
rule. The approach we take is to express the diﬀerent
contributions to 3-body energies in Jacobi coordinates

using these equations and then to expand the results as
power series in r/R.

We consider ﬁrst the additive terms Vdimer(rij ). For
R ≫ r the atom-atom C6 term makes contributions to
the atom-diatom coeﬃcients of Eq. (2) given by

(r, θ) = 2C6;

bution. It can thus contribute to the atom-diatom C6 coeﬃcient. Its geometric factor (24) may be expanded at large

The O(r−8) terms in Eqs. (42) and (43) come from the

order energy, while the O(r−6) terms in Eqs. (44) to (46)
come from both these and the (7, 7, 0) and (7, 4, 3) con-

tributions. The ﬁfth-order term (Eq. (27)) does not con-
tribute until O(r−9R−6).

FITTING DISPERSION COEFFICIENTS FOR Li
+ Li2

The equations above apply when all three of r1, r2
and r3 are large. However, when any of them is small,
the power series is insuﬃcient. We therefore use Eqs.
(42) to (46) as the long-range limits of more general ex-
pressions, constructed by (i) multiplying the individual
inverse power terms by damping functions Dn(r) and (ii)
adding a short-range exponential term to allow for the ef-
fects of orbital overlap.

As described above, R´erat and Bussery-Honvault [21]
have calculated isotropic and anisotropic dispersion co-
eﬃcients for Li + Li2 (3Σ+
u ) as a function of r and have
ﬁtted them to long-range expansions. They stated that
“no asymptotic form of the coeﬃcients C6 exists to our
knowledge”, but found empirically that C2
6 (r) required
both r−3 and r−6 terms, while C0
6 (r) required only r−6.
Our expressions (42) and (43) above provide the expla-
nation for this. However, our results also show that there
should be relationships among the coeﬃcients of the ﬁt,
and the resulting constraints were not included in ref.
21. In particular, the coeﬃcient of r−6 in C2
6 should be

5

6 and Z1111 can be related at least approx-

half that in C0
imately to Z111 and C6 as described below.
In devising functional forms for C0

6 (r) it
is important to consider damping of the inverse power
terms. For the two-body interaction energy, the most
popular approach is to use Tang-Toennies damping func-
tions [30] of the form

6 (r) and C2

Dn(R) = 1 − e

.

When damping 3-body terms such as Eqs. (6) and (14)
to (17), a damping function is required for each rn
i . We
have chosen to use
D2n(ri) rather than Dn(ri) for this
purpose, because this recovers the correct Dn(R) in the
2-body energies. Thus we damp 3-body terms according
to prescriptions such as

When damping is introduced in this way, the r−6 terms
in the expressions for dispersion coeﬃcients are damped
with D6(r), but the r−3 term in C2
6 (r) is damped with
D6(r) rather than D3(r). The expressions that we ﬁt

to are therefore

triple-dipole coeﬃcient was ﬁxed at a value taken from
variational calculations with Hylleraas basis sets by Yan
et al. [31], Z111 = νabc/3 = 5.687 × 104 Eha9
0 (where a0
is the Bohr radius and Eh is the Hartree energy). There
is no ab initio value available for the quadruple-dipole
coeﬃcient, but in a Drude model Z1111 = (5/32)V α4 as
described above, where V is a characteristic excitation
energy and α is the atomic dipole polarizability. Within
the same model, C6 = (3/4)V α2 and Z111 = (3/16)V α3.
Combining these results gives an estimate

Z1111 ≈

10(Z111)2
3C6

.

(52)

For Li3 with C6 and Z111 values from ref. 31, this gives
Z1111 = 7.73 × 106 Eha12
0 . The C6 coeﬃcient in Eq. (50)
could not be ﬁxed at the value C6 = 1393 Eha6
0 from ref.

31, because the results for C6(r) in ref. 21 converge on a
slightly diﬀerent asymptotic value, so C6 was allowed to
vary in our ﬁt.

Meath and coworkers [32, 33] have calculated disper-
sion damping functions for Li2 and found that the r−6
damping function is around 0.45 at the diatomic mini-
mum, re ≈ 4.2 ˚A. With the Tang-Toennies form of D6(r),
this requires b ≈ 1.5 ˚A−1. We found that the exponent
C needed to ﬁt the short-range part of C6(r) was very
diﬀerent from br0, so we allowed br0 and C to be dif-
ferent and ﬁxed b at 1.5 ˚A−1. The remaining param-
eters were then determined by a weighted least-squares
0, A = 17.2 ± 2.6 Eha6
ﬁt, giving values C6 = 1414.8 Eha6
0,
B = 35.2 ± 3.9 Eha6
0 and C = 5.13 ± 0.25. The quality
of the resulting ﬁt is shown in Fig. 1, together with the
contributions of the individual terms in Eqs. (50) and
(51).

It thus appears that r = 4.2 ˚A is too small a distance
for the C8(r) coeﬃcients to be dominated by undamped
long-range contributions, and indeed it may be seen from
Fig. 1 that the exponential contributions to C0
6 (r) and
C2
6 (r) are quite large at this distance. It would be very
interesting to calculate r-dependent C8 coeﬃcients and
explore the onset of long-range behaviour.

GLOBAL FUNCTIONAL FORMS FOR
POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES

6

The results obtained above have important implica-
tions for the choice of functional forms to represent
potential energy surfaces for triatomic systems. For
low-energy scattering calculations, it is highly desirable
to have an interaction potential that dissociates cor-
rectly both to three atoms and to an atom and a di-
atomic molecule. This is especially important for pro-
cesses such as 3-body recombination and collisions of
long-range diatomic molecules with atoms, which are of
current interest in studies of cold molecule formation
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

A global potential energy surface for a homonuclear
triatomic system must be symmetric in the atom indices
if it is to reproduce the full symmetry of the system.
The simplest coordinate system that achieves this is a
set of 3 bond length coordinates (r12, r23, r31). Jacobi
coordinates cannot easily describe the full symmetry.

Our approach is to obtain a potential energy surface
from high-quality ab initio calculations on a grid of val-
ues (r12, r23, r31). Once this has been done, we need to
interpolate and extrapolate it in a way that incorporates
the correct long-range behaviour. In one dimension, re-
ciprocal power - reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RP-
RKHS) interpolation [35, 36, 37] provides an attractive
way to obtain a potential with desired inverse power be-
haviour at long range. However, multidimensional RP-
RKHS interpolation [18, 35] at best gives a potential that
extrapolates beyond the points as a simple product of
inverse powers in the diﬀerent coordinates. None of the
long-range 3-body terms have this form, so a more so-
phisticated approach is required.

Two diﬀerent cases may be distinguished. For systems
such as spin-polarized Na3 or K3, the nonadditive forces
are substantial at short range but do not dwarf the addi-
tive forces [18, 19]. Under these circumstances, we have
found it best to transform the potential to a form that
does behave as a simple product of inverse powers at
long range and then interpolate in that form. The ﬁrst
stage in this process is to subtract the (assumed known)
sum of pair potentials from the ab initio points accord-
ing to Eq. (3) to obtain the nonadditive contribution to
the interaction, V3(r). The leading terms in the long-
range expansion of V3(r) are the DDD and DDQ terms.
However, it may be noted that the DDD term of Eq. (6)
vanishes on a seam in the angular space and the DDQ
term of Eq. (14) vanishes at all linear conﬁgurations. It
is therefore not adequate to divide V3(r) by an angular
factor in order to obtain a form that depends only on in-
verse powers. Fortunately, the coeﬃcients Z111 and Z112
are known for all the homonuclear alkali metal atom sys-
tems [34], so that damped versions of these terms can be
subtracted from the total nonadditive energy V3 to give

In our work on K3 [15], we used a single damping function
for both terms. However, the present work has shown
that it would be better to choose separate damping func-
tions for each inverse power term as in Eqs. (48) and (49),
and to deﬁne (for example)

V DDQ

The leading term in the asymptotic multipole expan-
sion of V ′
3 is the fourth-order dipole-dipole-dipole term
(DDDD), which has the more complicated (unfactoriz-
able) form of Eq. (24) above, with powers (6,6,0). If Z1111
is known, this too could be subtracted out. However, this
term is negative at all geometries, so a satisfactory alter-
native is to eliminate it by deﬁning V ′′
3 (r),
where

3 (r) = g(r) × V ′

3 now has

the form −constant × r

13 and is suitable for an
“isotropic” extrapolation of the type that results from a
multidimensional RP-RKHS interpolation.

The approach that we use is therefore to construct V ′′
3
at the ab initio points as above and then interpolate it
using the fully symmetrized 3D RP-RKHS interpolation
method [18]. An RP-RKHS interpolation with respect
to rp with RKHS parameters n and m gives a potential
with leading long-range powers r−p(m+1) and r−p(m+2).
Appropriate choices thus include p = 3, m = 0 (as in our
work on K3 [15]) and p = 1, m = 2. The interpolated
potential is then rebuilt as

A system such as quartet Li3 requires a diﬀerent ap-
proach [17].
In this case the nonadditive forces are so
large that at short range it does not make sense to decom-
pose the potential into additive and nonadditive parts at
all. The nonadditive potential is many times larger than
the additive potential [19], and the decomposition would
require the ﬁnal short-range potential to be expressed
as the diﬀerence of two large numbers. Nevertheless, at
long range a decomposition according to Eq. (3) is es-
sential. Under these circumstances, we found it best to
carry out an unconstrained ﬁt to the ab initio points at
short range, without imposing the correct long-range be-
haviour, to obtain a short-range function VSR(r). We
then use a switching function S(r) to join this onto the
correct long-range form. We thus have

V (r) = S(r)VSR(r) + [1 − S(r)]VLR(r).

atom distances is large. In our work on Li3 [17], we used

VLR(r) =

The function of the term V DD
the atom-diatom dispersion coeﬃcients C0

have the correct values (given by Eqs. (50) and (51)) even
when one of the atom-atom distances is small. When
R ≫ r, this is achieved by deﬁning

where x = (r12 − r0)/r0 as before and the parameters A,

6 (r) and
C2
In evaluating Eq. (60) it is
convenient to use an approximate form of P2(cos θ) that
is valid for R ≫ r but is well-behaved at all geometries,

6 (r) as described above.

P2(cos θ) ≈ −

This is already evaluated as part of W111(r), and since
it is symmetric the cyclic permutations required in Eq.
(60) involve no extra geometric calculations.

Finally, the switching function S(r) must become zero
when any of the three atom-atom distances is large. For
Li3 we chose to use

The long-range form must be valid when any of the atom-

tanh[1 − s1(r1 + r2 + r3 − s2)],

(62)

S(r) =

with the parameters s1 and s2 determined in such a way
that the switching takes place in a region where both
functional forms give reasonably accurate energies.

CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the relationship between long-
range intermolecular forces for triatomic systems in the
atom-diatom and atom-atom-atom representations. We
have obtained expressions relating the dispersion coeﬃ-
cients in the two representations. We have shown that
the anisotropy of the atom-diatom C6 dispersion coeﬃ-
cient arises entirely from nonadditive terms in the 3-body
expansion. The most signiﬁcant contributions at long
range arise from the third-order triple-dipole term and
the fourth-order quadruple-dipole term. The leading con-
tributions to the atom-diatom C8 coeﬃcient arise from
the additive atom-atom C6 and C8 coeﬃcients and the
third-order nonadditive triple-dipole and dipole-dipole-
quadrupole coeﬃcients.

There is great current interest in the formation of di-
atomic molecules in cold atomic gases, and the collisional
properties of such molecules are of great importance.
Calculations on these collisions need triatomic interac-
tion potentials that dissociate properly both to an atom
and a diatomic molecule and to three separated atoms.
We have used our results to suggest strategies for obtain-
ing such potentials.

The multipole response of 3HeN drops doped with very attractive impurities, such as a Xe atom
or an SF6 molecule, has been investigated in the framework of the Finite Range Density Functional
Theory and the Random Phase Approximation. We show that volume (L = 0) and surface (L = 1,
2) modes become more fragmented, as compared with the results obtained for pure 3HeN drops. In
addition, the dipole mean energy goes smoothly to zero when N increases, indicating that for large
N values these impurities are delocalized in the bulk of the drop.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of helium drops has been the object of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations1–4. One of
the goals of these studies is to understand how various bulk physical properties of the quantum liquid are modiﬁed
in restricted geometries. Special mention deserves the emerging ﬁeld of infrared spectroscopy of molecules inside
or attached to helium droplets3–6 which has motivated a great theoretical activity to determine how the molecular
moments of inertia are aﬀected by the helium environment7,8.

The main experimental eﬀort has focused on the study of pure and doped 4HeN drops, for which a microscopic
description of the ground state (gs) using Monte Carlo techniques3,9–15, and of the elementary excitations using an
optimized variational method16,17 are available. Density functional calculations of the gs and excitation spectrum
using ﬁnite-range (FRDF) or zero-range density functionals have been carried out, see Refs. 18–22 and references
therein. Recently, the physical appearance of quantized vortices pinned by dopant molecules in 4He droplets has been
studied within the FRDF theory23.

In the case of 3He drops, experimental data are becoming available24. Small 3He drops are diﬃcult to produce since
a minimum number of atoms is needed to produce a selfbound drop25, and are as diﬃcult to observe as 4He drops
because they are neutral. Nevertheless, 3He systems constitute the only Fermi systems capable of being observed
in bulk liquid and droplets, and for this reason they have attracted some theoretical interest. Yet, microscopic
calculations of 3He droplets are scarce, and only concern the gs structure25–27. A mass-formula for 3He drops
based on an extended Thomas-Fermi method has been proposed28, and the binding energy of open-shell 3He drops
has been determined by a semiempirical shell-correction method29. The gs of small polarized Li-3HeN clusters has
been determined using the Path Integral Monte Carlo Method30. Ground state properties of 3He drops doped with
some inert atoms and molecular impurities have been recently studied31 within the FRDF theory, as well as the gs
structure of pure or doped mixed 3He-4He droplets32,33. Studies of mixed droplets are relevant in connection with
the experimental results presented in Ref. 5. Indeed, it is crucial to know the composition of the ﬁrst solvation shells
around the impurity to determine if the dopant molecule is in a superﬂuid environment5, or to determine whether the
molecule may couple to bosonic or fermionic-type liquid excitations which in turn determines the dissipative picture
of the molecule rotational spectrum34.

Previously quoted references indicate that there has been an enormous impetus in the development and application
of microscopic techniques to the description of liquid helium drops. However, current experiments sometimes have
to deal with situations that cannot be addressed by fully microscopic methods. We can mention, for example, the
description of very large 4He and 3He drops35,36, or the structure of large mixed drops already discussed. As a
matter of fact, in spite of the recent progress made in the variational description26 of small (up to 40 atoms) 3He
droplets, a simultaneous description of ground state and elementary excitations of pure 3He droplets has been only
obtained within the density functional theory, using either zero-range37,38 or ﬁnite-range density functionals39–42. In
these situations, density functional theory results provide a useful guide to the appearance of interesting physical
phenomena obtained at the price of introducing some phenomenology.

The aim of this work is to analyze the distortions caused by the presence of an impurity like a Xe atom or an SF6
molecule in the excitation spectrum of a 3He droplet. The solvation energies of these impurities have been found to

1

be negative31, and this makes plausible the scenario underlying in our calculation. We have analyzed this eﬀect in the
framework of the FRDF theory and the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). This paper is organized as follows:
In Section II we brieﬂy introduce the ﬁnite-range density functional we use, and the particle-hole (ph) interaction
employed in the RPA calculations. In Section III we present results for the volume L = 0 and the low-multipolarity
surface excitations. A preliminary account of the dipole response has been previously reported43. In Section IV we
draw the conclusions, and in an Appendix we present an example of how the angular decomposition of the ph matrix
elements has been carried out.

II. THE FINITE RANGE DENSITY FUNCTIONAL AND PARTICLE-HOLE INTERACTION

In the framework of the density functional theory, the ground state of 3HeN doped drops is found by minimizing

the energy E written as

The particle ρ(~r ), current ~j(~r ) and kinetic energy τ (~r ) densities are written in terms of the single particle (sp)
wave functions φk(~r ) obtained solving the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations deduced from Eq. (2). For systems having
an eﬀective mass m∗(r), the inclusion of a term ~j 2/ρ in Eq. (2) guarantees that the density functional is Galilean
invariant44. This term has no inﬂuence on the ground state of time-reversal invariant, spin-saturated droplets, and
for this reason it is usually omitted. However, its contribution to the ph interaction for systems like the present one,
in which the impurity is treated as an external ﬁeld breaking the translational invariance of the system, cannot be
neglected.

The distortion of the ground state structure of 3He drops due to the presence of impurities has been described in
detail in Ref. 31. To analyze the multipole excitations induced by an external ﬁeld that couples to the particle density
of the drop, we have used the time-dependent version of the density functional theory. For suﬃciently weak external
ﬁelds the response can be treated linearly within the RPA. In this approximation the elementary excitations of the
system are described in terms of correlated ph transitions. The amplitude of a particular excited state in the basis
of a discrete space of ph transitions is obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian H = H0 + Vph, which is the sum of
the KS Hamiltonian H0 plus the ph interaction Vph. This is done solving the RPA equation47,48

If m∗ = m in the density functional (a situation which we indicate with the notation E = E[ρ]), the second variation

Equation (16) shows that in addition to the Lennard-Jones potential VLJ , Eq. (3), the ph interaction has ﬁnite-range
terms, velocity dependent components, and other terms which combine both ﬁnite-range and velocity dependence
through the presence of gradient operators.

The next task is to calculate the matrix elements in the ph basis. This is greatly simpliﬁed in the case of droplets
with a magic number of 3He atoms, the only droplets studied here. In this case, the mean ﬁeld is spherically symmetric
and the angular part of the sp wave functions is a spherical harmonic. Performing a multipole expansion of the ph
interaction, the sum over third components can be done and only radial integrals remain to be numerically computed
(see the Appendix for details). This allows one to compute the RPA matrices A and B. After diagonalizing Eq. (6),

Obviously, the dimension of matrices A and B depends on how many particle-hole pairs mi are taken after dis-
cretizing the continuum. We have included enough sp states so that the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule is satisﬁed
within 98%. We have also checked that for pure drops the dipole mode is at zero energy due to the translational
invariance of the system.

To ﬁnish this Section, we would like to recall that originally, density functionals for liquid 3He were obtained from
a contact, velocity-dependent 3He-3He eﬀective interaction51 that made it rather simple to evaluate the contribution
of direct and exchange terms to the total energy and to the ph interaction. Later on, a ﬁnite-range component was
added to the contact interaction to improve its properties at ﬁnite momentum. This is the origin of the screened
Lennard-Jones potential52,53, which takes care of two major characteristics of the interatomic potential the original
eﬀective He-He interaction lacked, namely the hard core repulsion at short distances, and the asymptotic r−6 behavior.
Thus, exchange eﬀects, which are known to be large in liquid 3He, are phenomenologically accounted for in the density
functional through the eﬀective parameters entering its deﬁnition.

Figure 1 shows a comparison between the monopole (‘breathing mode’) spectrum of pure and doped drops. It is
seen that the presence of the impurity increases the fragmentation of the spectra in the high energy region. This
eﬀect is more important for small clusters and more attractive impurities. In both cases of pure and doped drops, the
j S(ωj) lies above the atom emission threshold (Fermi energy changed of
mean energy deﬁned as ¯ω =
sign) and decreases as the number of 3He atoms of the drop increases (see Figs. 2 and 3). It is worthwhile to recall
that for pure 4HeN droplets, except for rather small N values the monopole strength is in the discrete region of the
spectrum16,18,20, and that the presence of a Xe or SF6 impurity also increases the fragmentation of the spectrum; for
small drops the monopole strength lies in the continuum region20,22.

We display in Fig. 4 the transition densities corresponding to the more intense monopole peaks of Xe+3He40.
This ﬁgure shows the well-known fact that the monopole is a volume mode: the induced densities have a node and
penetrate inside the drop. The bulk oscillations are connected with the oscillations in the drop density ρ(r), also
shown in Fig. 4, which are due to the distribution of 3He atoms in solvation shells around the dopant on the one
hand, and to the repulsive core of the eﬀective interaction, on the other hand.

The L = 1 spectrum shows again that fragmentation increases for the more attractive impurities (see Fig. 5). In
this case the mean dipole energy always lies below the continuum threshold and decreases with the number of 3He

atoms of the drop. In spite that small doped drops are stable to dipole ﬂuctuations since a large energy is needed
to induce the oscillation of the impurity against the 3He atoms, Fig. 3 shows that when the drop size increases the
dipole mean energy rapidly decreases and the mode eventually becomes unstable. This is considered a clear signature
that the impurity is delocalized in the bulk of the drop17,22,43. The dipole mode has also been found to be unstable22
for large 4HeN drops doped with inert atoms and SF6, for which the mean dipole energy lies in the discrete part of
the spectrum.

C. Quadrupole mode

Fig. 6 shows that, as compared to the pure case, the presence of a rather attractive impurity pushes this mode
downwards in energy. When this causes the quadrupole mode to move from the continuum to the discrete part of the
energy spectrum, the fragmentation decreases and the peak becomes more collective. This is the case for N = 40, for
example. For larger drops, the quadrupole mode is below the atom emission threshold, see Fig. 3 (this also happens
in pure drops), and the eﬀect is not so clearly seen.

Examples of induced densities for dipole and quadrupole modes are shown in Fig. 7. They are localized at the drop

surface, as it corresponds to the surface character of these modes.

We would like to close this Section indicating that in the case of pure 3He droplets, a comparison with results for
L = 0 and 2 modes obtained using density functionals built using fairly diﬀerent strategies38,39 yields an overall good
agreement.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the multipole collective excitations of 3HeN drops doped with Xe atoms and SF6 molecules
in the framework of the FRDF theory plus the RPA. A comparison with the results for pure drops shows that the
presence of these strongly attractive impurities increases the spectrum fragmentation. This eﬀect appears in volume
and surface modes as well, and it is more marked for small clusters and more attractive impurities.

The presence of an attractive impurity decreases the mean energy of surface modes as in the case of doped 4HeN
clusters22. For large clusters the mean energy of surface modes lies below the atom emission threshold, whereas for
the monopole volume mode it is always above the threshold.

When the cluster size increases the dipole mean excitation goes to zero, indicating that the impurity is delocalized
in the bulk of the drop for 3He clusters doped with Xe and SF6 impurities. A similar eﬀect was found in 4He clusters.
From the experience gathered in the case of 4He clusters, we may conclude that whereas the precise value of the
(rather fragmented) collective modes may be sensitive to the arbitrariness introduced in the choice of some of the
FRDF ingredients, as for example the core of the screened Lennard-Jones potential, we consider robust the prediction
of the impurity delocalization, as well as the evolution of the mean mode energies with the number of atoms.

This work has been supported in part by DGESIC (Spain), grants PB98-0124 and PB98-1247, and by the Generalitat

de Catalunya Program 2000SGR-00024.

For a spherically symmetric system the dimension of the ph space can be drastically reduced by analytically summing
over the degenerate third components of the angular momentum. We illustrate this point taking as an example the
Lennard-Jones contribution VLJ (~r ) to the ph interaction assuming that the ph states are coupled to yield an orbital
angular momentum (L, ML), and a spin (S, MS). Using the appropriate sp quantum numbers we represent the orbital
φa in coordinate and spin spaces as

The matrix elements of the residual interaction (16) between the ph states can then be obtained as

These integrals are obtained numerically. To describe the states above the continuum threshold we have followed the
usual prescription of enclosing the system in a sphere of large radius and require that the radial wave functions vanish
at this distance. In this way we obtain a discrete spectrum of states that replaces the continuum. We have checked
that the results are stable against reasonable changes of the radius of the sphere, which we have taken to be about 3
times larger than the mean square radius of the cluster.

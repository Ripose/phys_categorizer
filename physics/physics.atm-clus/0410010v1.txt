Abstract

The four most stable structures of NiN clusters with N from 2 to 150 have been determined

using a combination of the embedded-atom method in the version of Daw, Baskes and Foiles, the

variable metric/quasi-Newton method, and our own Aufbau/Abbau method. A systematic study of

energetics, structure, growth, and stability of also larger clusters has been carried through without

more or less severe assumptions on the initial geometries in the structure optimization, on the

symmetry, or on bond lengths. It is shown that cluster growth is predominantly icosahedral with

islands of fcc, tetrahedral and decahedral growth. For the ﬁrst time in unbiased computations

it is found that Ni147 is the multilayer (third Mackay) icosahedron. Further, we point to an

enhanced ability of fcc clusters to compete with the icosahedral and decahedral structures in the

vicinity of N = 79. In addition, it is shown that conversion from the hcp/anti-Mackay kind of

icosahedral growth to the fcc/Mackay one occurs within a transition layer including several cluster

sizes. Moreover, we present and apply diﬀerent analytical tools in studying structural and energetic

properties of such a large class of clusters. These include means for identifying the overall shape, the

occurrence of atomic shells, the similarity of the clusters with, e.g., fragments of the fcc crystal or of

a large icosahedral cluster, and a way of analysing whether the N -atom cluster can be considered

constructed from the (N − 1)-atom one by adding an extra atom.

In addition, we compare in

detail with results from chemical-probe experiment. Maybe the most central result is that ﬁrst for

clusters with N above 80 general trends can be identiﬁed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Clusters are important materials both from the point of view of basic research and from an

application point of view. Their, partly controllable, unique physical and chemical properties

can be related to the large surface-to-volume ratio or to ﬁnite-size or quantum-conﬁnement

eﬀects. These properties make them interesting for use in, e.g., nanoelectronics and in

catalysis.

The central issue is to understand and predict how the properties of interest depend on the

size of the cluster. However, addressing this question is complicated by a number of serious

problems. First, clusters contain typically from some 10s to several 100s of atoms, so that

they are neither small, well-characterized molecules, nor macroscopic, approximately inﬁnite

crystals. Moreover, in experimental studies, one often considers an ensemble of more or less

mono-disperse clusters whose size distribution is largely unknown. Second, experimental

and theoretical studies focus often on diﬀerent systems: in experiment the clusters may be

dispersed in some solvent and may possess surfactants and only sometimes are produced in

the gas phase, whereas isolated clusters in this gas phase almost exclusively are the subject of

theoretical studies. Third, in theoretical works the fairly large size of the individual clusters

makes it necessary to invoke one or more approximations: either highly accurate methods

on selected clusters with pre-chosen structures are applied, or less accurate, parameterized

methods are used on more diﬀerent clusters, but also then the structures are often chosen

‘reasonably’.

In this work we shall present results of our theoretical studies on NiN clusters with N

up to 150. Our approach is based on the approximate embedded-atom method (EAM)

in calculating the total energy of a given structure and we shall show that this method

provides a good compromise between accuracy and computational speed. Moreover, we

have used our own Aufbau/Abbau method in determining the structures of the lowest total

energies. Ni clusters provide one of the most studies sets of clusters and, therefore, is an

excellent system for exploring new theoretical or experimental approaches. This is our main

reason for focusing on that system. Moreover, through our unbiased structure-optimization

approach we are able to identify the structures of more low-energy structures for each size,

and, simultaneously, obtain structure and total energy for all values of N up to N = 150,

whereby size-speciﬁc properties can be extracted.

2

Once the structure of a given cluster has been chosen, the variational principle allows

for a systematic improvement of the calculated electronic properties. A similar approach

does not exist for the structural properties where one, instead, has to use more or less

biased methods for determining the structure of the lowest total energy. Here, three issues

make such theoretical studies very demanding: ﬁrst, the computational eﬀorts for a single

structure scales with N to some power from 2 and upwards; second, the number of structural

parameters that have to be determined scale linearly with N; and, third, the number of

meta-stable structures scales faster than any power of N.1 Therefore, any theoretical study

employs one or more approximation that may or may not be crucial.

Accordingly, parameter-free calculations on NiN clusters2,3,4,5,6,7 have been applied mainly

for smaller clusters as well as on single, high-symmetric, larger ones. Alternatively, unbi-

ased structure optimizations for larger clusters are all based on more approximate total-

energy methods like the EAM or related methods,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 whereby only for

N ≤ 55 the structure has been optimized completely unbiased, or the very simple n-body

Gupta,18,19,20,21,22 Sutton-Chen,23 Finnis-Sinclair,25 Murrell-Mottram,26 or Morse potential27

has been used, whereby unbiased structure optimizations up to N = 80 have been car-

ried through.23 Only for very simple and material-unspeciﬁc potentials, like the Lennard-

Jones potential, largely unbiased structure optimizations up to N ∼ 150 have been car-

ried through.24 Finally, NiN clusters have also been studied with a tight-binding method,28

whereby the structure only for clusters with N ≤ 10 was optimized unbiased.

Of the experimental studies on NiN clusters,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37 the chemical-probe
experiments29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 have given very valuable information on the structure of the

smaller clusters. On the other hand, results for medium and large Ni clusters,37 obtained

by performing near-threshold photoionization and time-of-ﬂight mass spectroscopy can be

used in identifying particularly stable clusters and, subsequently, in providing information

on growth modes.

¿From the earlier studies on nickel clusters it has been found that highly stable clusters

occur for N = 13 and N = 55 for which the structures are multilayer icosahedra, i.e.,

the ﬁrst and second Mackay icosahedra. Moreover, in several theoretical studies17,22,23 a

fcc truncated octahedron was found for Ni38 which is in accord with experimental results.

Thus, it can be assumed that for these three cluster sizes a ‘structural consensus’ has been

achieved, which in turn provides a useful check for any further study. On the other hand,

3

for N = 75 some theoretical studies22,23 have predicted Marks decahedron to be the most

stable structure, in disagreement with experiment. Moreover, the cluster growth pattern for

intermediate sizes, i.e., for 13 < N < 55 and for N > 55, remains unclear and the obtained

results seem to depend strongly on the used approach.

In the present study the structure and the energetics of the four most stable isomers for

small and medium-sized NiN clusters with N from 2 to 150 have been determined for each

cluster size using a combination of the EAM (for calculation of the total energy for a given

structure), the variable metric/quasi-Newton method (for the determination of local total-

energy minima), and our own Aufbau/Abbau method (for the determination of the global

total-energy minimum). Except for two cases (N = 75 and N = 104; here we included the

decahedron as a starting conﬁguration) our structure-determination is completely unbiased.

In particular, as we shall see, it is important to go beyond N = 80 (the upper limit in the

earlier unbiased structure-optimizations) in order to identify growth patterns. In addition,

we shall present results for clusters that are obtained as relaxed spherical parts of the fcc

crystal with N up to some 1000s.

The paper is organized as follows.

In Sec. II we brieﬂy outline the embedded-atom

method, and in Sec. III we present our structural-determination methods. The main results

are given in Sec. IV, and a brief summary is oﬀered in Sec. V. Finally, for the sake of

completeness we mention that some preliminary results on clusters with up to N = 100 and

results for the energetically lowest isomer were presented earlier38,39 and in the discussion of
the results we shall use eV and ˚A as units of energy and length, respectively.

II. EMBEDDED-ATOM METHOD

We use the EAM of Daw, Baskes, and Foiles40,41,42,43 for the calculation of the total energy

of a given cluster with a given structure. The main idea of Daw and Baskes40,41 is to split the

total energy of a (metallic) system of interest into two components. The embedding energy

is obtained by considering each atom as an impurity embedded into a host provided by the

rest of the atoms. The remaining part is written as a sum of pair potentials. Accordingly,

Etot =

Fi(ρh

i ) +

Xi

1
2 Xi,j (i6=j)

φij(Rij),

(1)

where ρh
i

is the local electron density at site i, Fi is the embedding energy, i.e., the energy

required to embed an atom into this density, and φij is a short-range potential between

atoms i and j separated by the distance Rij,

Here the eﬀective charges Zi(Rij) and Zj(Rij) depend on Rij. The local electron density at

site i is assumed being a superposition of atomic electron densities

φij =

Zi(Rij) Zj(Rij)
Rij

.

ρh
i =

ρa
i (Rij),

Xj (6=i)

(2)

(3)

where ρa

i (Rij) is the spherically averaged atomic electron density provided by atom j at the

distance Rij.

In the present approach, the atomic densities have been taken from Hartree-Fock calcu-

lations of Refs. [44,45]. Moreover, adjustable parameters that deﬁne Fi and φij have been

obtained by ﬁtting to known bulk properties such as sublimation energy, lattice constant,

the heat of solution of binary alloys and, additionally, to the universal equation of Rose,46

which describes the sublimation energy of the most metals as a function of lattice constant.

The values for ρa

i , Fi and Zi that we have used are available in numerical form for Ni, Cu,

Ag, Au, Pd and Pt.47

Our main reason for choosing the EAM is that the EAM provides a computationally

eﬃcient, parameterized many-particle method that allows for many calculations of also larger

systems. Thus, with this method we can perform unbiased structure optimizations for

clusters with well above 100 atoms, which is not possible using more accurate, parameter-

free methods. Moreover, by comparing (see Sec. IV A) with results of more accurate studies

for the smallest clusters we can estimate the accuracy of the method. Since the method

has been developed ﬁrst of all for macroscopic metallic systems, in particular the smallest

clusters may be those for which the largest inaccuracies show up.

III. OPTIMIZATION OF THE STRUCTURE

Using expression (1) we can calculate the total energy of any cluster with any structure as
a function of atomic coordinates { ~Ri}, Etot( ~R1, ~R2, . . . , ~RN ). In order to obtain the closest
local total-energy minimum we use the variable metric/quasi-Newton method.48 We found

that this was signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient than the conjugate gradient method.

5

For searching the global minima we have developed our own Aufbau/Abbau method. It

consists of the following steps:

1) We consider two cluster sizes with N and N + K atoms with K ≃ 5 − 10. For

each of those we study a set of randomly generated structures, Nran ≃ 1000. Using the

quasi-Newton method the Nran relaxed structures are identiﬁed and the structures of the

lowest total energy selected. Each of the Nran starting structures for a cluster with M atoms

was generated using a random-number generator for positions within a sphere or a cube of
volume Vcl = (p · bnn)3M, where bnn = 2.49 ˚A is the nearest-neighbor distance of bulk Ni

and p = 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, i.e. we considered slightly compressed, normal, and slightly expanded

structures. We included the constraints that the smallest allowed inter-atomic distance was

0.5bnn and each atom has to interact with at least two others.

2) One by one, each of the M atoms is displaced randomly, and the closest local minima

is determined. If the new structure has a lower total energy than the original one, this new

one is kept, and the old one discarded. This is repeated approximately 500 − 1000 times

(depending on cluster size).

3) This leaves us with two ‘source’ clusters, NiN and NiN +K with their lowest total

energies. One by one an atom is added at a random position to the structure with N atoms

(many hundred times for each size), and the structures are relaxed. In parallel, one by one an

atom is removed from the structure with N + K atoms — for each intermediate cluster with

N ′ atoms we consider all N ′ + 1 possible conﬁgurations, that one can obtain by removing

one atom from the NiN ′+1 cluster. ¿From the two series of structures for N ≤ M ≤ N + K

those structures of the lowest energies are chosen and these are used as seeds for a new set of

calculations. First, when no lower total energies are found, it is assumed that the structures

of the global-total-energy minima have been identiﬁed, and we proceed to larger clusters.

Moreover, by keeping information on not only the single energetically lowest isomer, but

more low-lying ones, we have been able to identify the energetically four lowest-lying isomers.

Our method combines randomness with regularity and is signiﬁcantly more eﬃcient com-

pared to the case when only random starting geometries are used. In addition, it is com-

pletely unbiased. However, as for any structure-determination method, there is no guarantee

that we have identiﬁed the true global total-energy minima, although we believe that we

in most cases have very good candidates. But, unfortunately, in two cases, N = 75 and

N = 104 (both cases correspond to decahedral structures, which often have been diﬃcult to

6

ﬁnd in unbiased structure optimizations), our approach failed and we had to include that in

our study explicitly, and in another, N = 38, we only got the previously obtained structure

after considerably more attempts than otherwise used. We add that similar problems have

been observed and analysed in studies on Lennard-Jones clusters.49

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

A. Small clusters — accessing the accuracy

The smallest clusters, i.e., NiN for 2 ≤ N ≤ 13, provide an excellent test for our approach

of two reasons: The clusters are so small that the number of (meta-)stable structures is

small, which in turn means that the global total-minimum within a given approach can be

identiﬁed. And since the EAM has its foundations in considerations for inﬁnite, extended

metallic systems with largely delocalized electrons, the small clusters should be those that

with most diﬃculties can be treated by our approach. Therefore, we have in Table I tabulated

our obtained structural parameters for 2 ≤ N ≤ 8 and N = 13 in comparison with results

of other theoretical or experimental studies.

The table shows that the structure, here given through the average bond length hri, is

most often given within a couple of % of the results of experiment or of parameter-free

electronic-structure calculations. Moreover, none of the other parameterized methods, i.e.,

the tight-binding approach or model potentials of the Sutton-Chen, Gupta, or eﬀective-

medium type, gives results that are systematically more accurate than our approach does.

This is important since for the larger clusters that we shall discuss here it is not possible

to apply accurate parameter-free methods when simultaneously attempting to optimize the

structure.

The table also shows that the relative ordering of the diﬀerent isomers may diﬀer for

diﬀerent methods. Hence, for N = 7 most parameterized methods predict the D5h isomer

to have a lower total energy than the C3v structure, whereas experiment and parameter-free

theoretical studies predict a reversed ordering. Therefore, it can be important to calculate

more diﬀerent, energetically low-lying isomers when studying theoretically the properties of

not very small clusters — identifying a diﬀerent isomer as the one of the lowest total energy

may suggest a signiﬁcant disagreement between diﬀerent studies.

7

In order to emphasize this point further we show in Fig. 1 the structures of the two

energetically lowest isomers for 6 ≤ N ≤ 13. It is very clearly seen that in some cases the

two isomers are indeed very diﬀerent and identifying the ‘wrong’ one as the most stable one

may give unexpected results.

It may also surprise that for the two isomers for N = 7 that look very diﬀerent we ﬁnd

a total-energy diﬀerence of only 0.03 eV/atom. To our knowledge there exist two DFT

calculations of Ni7 cluster.5,6 Both studies predict for the two energetically lowest isomers

a capped octahedron and a pentagonal bipyramid, respectively. The corresponding average

binding energy per atom are found to diﬀer by only 0.05–0.07 eV/atom, i.e., very similar to

Table I and Fig. 1 give one further result for N = 7: Ni7 is the smallest cluster that

incorporates the ﬁvefold symmetry axis, an important element of icosahedral and decahedral

our ﬁndings.

symmetries.

For N = 8 our two energetically lowest isomers diﬀer in energy by 0.016 eV/atom, in

good agreement with the value of 0.02 eV/atom found by Desmarais et al.

in a DFT

study.6 There are some fundamental diﬀerences between diﬀerent ab initio studies on Ni8
cluster.3,4,6,7 According to one study4 a cube is the most stable structure for Ni8, whereas
in other studies6,7 a cube was only the 5th isomer. Further, in another work7 the second

isomer was found to be a bicapped trigonal prism (C2v) and a capped pentagonal bipyramid

was only isomer number four. Michelini et al.3 has found for the eight-atom nickel cluster

only one isomer with the tetrahedral symmetry Td. This GGA result is inconsistent with

all other studies. It seems that the LSDA calculations of Desmarais et al.6 have the best

agreement with both experimental and semiempirical studies.

To our best knowledge there are only DFT studies2,4 on NiN , 9 ≤ N ≤ 13, for N = 13.

At N = 13 the ﬁrst Mackay icosahedron (Ih) is constructed. The second isomer is 1.16 eV

less stable. This is a rather large value and the icosahedron as the most stable structure

for Ni13 was found almost in all theoretical studies (the only exception being an extended-

H¨uckel study52). Once again we obtain good structural agreement with ab initio studies.2,4
The obtained bond lengths of 2.36 (center to vertex) and 2.48 ˚A (vertex to vertex) agree
well with those derived by Calleja et al.,2 i.e., 2.41±0.03 and 2.53±0.03 ˚A, and with those
of Reuse and Khanna,4, i.e., 2.23 and 2.34 ˚A, respectively. Furthermore, when comparing

the diﬀerences in the binding energies per atom between the Ni13 and Ni2 clusters, our value

8

of 1.525 eV/atom agrees very well with the corresponding value of 1.558 eV/atom obtained

using the self-consistent DFT program SIESTA.2

Closing this subsection we emphasize that for our purpose, the calculation of energetic and

structural properties of NiN clusters, the present EAM approach appears to be suﬃciently

accurate.

B. Energetic properties

In Fig. 2 we show the binding energy per atom for the optimized clusters for the four

energetically lowest isomers together with the binding energy per atom for clusters that

were constructed as relaxed, spherical parts of the fcc crystal structure (with an atom at the

center of the sphere) for N up to almost 2600. With few expectations the four total-energy

curves are so close that their diﬀerence can not be resolved in the ﬁgure. On the other hand,

except for N = 79, the fcc-derived clusters lie all below the other structures, indicating that

for N up to around 150 the fcc structure is not playing a signiﬁcant role as a structural motif

(an exception occurs for N = 38 for a fragment of the fcc crystal with the center not at an

atom — this case is not shown in the ﬁgure). Fig. 2(b) shows that the apparent saturation

is not real: ﬁrst when considering considerably larger clusters, the convergence towards an

average binding energy around 4.45 eV/atom can be recognized.

In order to identify the particularly stable clusters we shall consider two criteria. First,

a cluster may be considered very stable if its binding energy per atom is much larger than

that of the two neighboring clusters. This can be quantiﬁed through the stability function,

Etot(N + 1.1) + Etot(N − 1.1) − 2Etot(N.1), where Etot(N.k) is the total energy of the ener-

getically k-lowest isomer of the NiN cluster. This function, that has maxima for particularly

stable clusters, is shown in Fig. 3. Here we can identify a large number of particularly stable

clusters, i.e., so-called magic clusters. These are found for N = 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 19, 23, 26,

28, 32, 36, 39, 43, 46, 49, 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 71, 75, 77, 79, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 99, 101, 104,

108, 110, 114, 116, 119, 122, 125, 127, 129, 131, 137, and 147. The most pronounced peaks

occur at N = 13, 19, 23, 46, 49, 55, 71, 75, 116, 131, 137, and 147 and most of them contain

an odd number of atoms and, as seen in Table II, these clusters possess high symmetry,

including the highest icosahedral symmetry for Ni13, Ni55, and Ni147.

According to our other criterion for a particularly stable cluster, such a cluster occurs if

9

the energy diﬀerence between the two energetically lowest isomers Etot(N.2) − Etot(N.1) is

large. This energy diﬀerence together with the energy diﬀerences to the energetically higher

ones are shown in Fig. 4. It is striking that the energetically higher-lying isomers become

energetically less and less separated and, as seen when comparing with Fig. 3, many of the

clusters that are particularly stable according to the ﬁrst criterion is it also according to the

second one.

C. Structural properties

A central issue of our work is to identify general properties of the NiN clusters from

the large amount of information that we have obtained from the calculations. Instead of

discussing the individual clusters, in particular their structure (a brief summary of the

structures is given in the Appendix), we shall introduce diﬀerent quantities that are devised

to reduce the available information to some few key numbers.

First we shall consider the overall shape of the clusters. As we discussed in our earlier

report,39 it is useful to examine the 3 × 3 matrix containing the elements

with ul = 1˚A being our length unit, and s and t being x, y, and z, and with

Ist =

being the center of the cluster. The three eigenvalues of this matrix, Iαα, can be used

in separating the clusters into being overall spherical (all eigenvalues are identical), more

cigar-like shaped (one eigenvalue is large, the other two are small), or more lens-shaped (two

large and one small eigenvalue). Moreover, the average of the three eigenvalues, hIααi, is a

measure of the overall extension of the cluster. Finally, for a homogeneous sphere with N

atoms, the eigenvalues scale like N 5/3. Therefore, we show in Fig. 5 quantities related to

these eigenvalues but scaled by N −5/3.

In the ﬁgure we see that only some few clusters have an overall spherical shape (these are

found for the energetically lowest isomer for N = 4, 6, 13, 26, 28, 38, 55, and 147 and for

the next one for N = 54, 79, and 92), which all correspond to high-symmetry isomers (cf.

Table II) and, for the lowest-energy isomer, also to the class of magic clusters. Moreover, it

10

is interesting to notice that the average value follows more or less the same curve for all four

isomers, i.e., the more compact ones (with relative low average value) are found for N just

above 50 and above 140). Also the largest diﬀerences follow more or less the same curve,

except for some few cases mainly for N below 40. Therefore, except when the eigenvalues

all are very similar (i.e., the largest diﬀerence is very small, which occurs for N around 50,

100, and 140), the overall shape (i.e., lens- or cigar-like) is the same for all four isomers.

In our earlier work39 we showed that the structural development of the isomer of the lowest

total energy with advantage could be monitored through so-called similarity functions. Thus,

for a given cluster NiN we deﬁne a radial distance for each of the atoms

rn = | ~Rn − ~R0|

and sort these in increasing order.

Simultaneously we consider a large fragment of a fcc crystal or, alternatively, a large

cluster of icosahedral symmetry. Also for these we deﬁne a radial distance for each atom,

r′
n, that also are sorted. In order to compare the given cluster with any of those systems we

calculate subsequently

(ul = 1˚A), which approaches 1 if the NiN cluster is very similar to the reference system. In

Fig. 6 we show the resulting functions in four cases, i.e., when comparing with the relaxed

Ni309 cluster of icosahedral symmetry, and when comparing with three fragments of the

fcc crystal diﬀering in the position of the center (the position of an atom, the middle of a

nearest-neighbor bond, and the center of the cube, respectively).

We see that both clusters that clearly resemble fcc fragments and such that resemble

icosahedral clusters can be identiﬁed. Of obvious reasons, the latter is the case for N around

13, 55, and 147, but it is interesting to notice that these clusters are not singular: clusters

with a large similarity to icosahedral clusters are found over a larger range of clusters (∼10)

around the truly icosahedral cluster. Similarly, clusters that are close to being fragments of

the fcc crystal can be identiﬁed around N = 13, 28, 38, and 79. Moreover, it is surprising

to observe that all four isomers for a given size show very similar similarity functions.

(8)

Also the radial distances themselves can give some interesting information. These are

shown in Fig. 7 for the four diﬀerent isomers as functions of cluster size. Up to N around

40, only few trends can be identiﬁed (with the exception of N = 13), but for N just above

50 a clear tendency towards shell-construction can be seen. Whereas this transition towards

shell-construction is fairly smooth as a function of cluster size, independent of whether we

start from the larger or the smaller clusters, in the range 75 ≤ N ≤ 80 abrupt changes

occur also towards some shell-construction. That this size range is special shall be discussed

in more detail below. Also for N close to 115 this tendency is seen, but most dramatic

are the results for clusters around 140 and above where, for all four isomers, a very clear

shell-construction is identiﬁed. Comparing with Fig. 6 we see that this is correlated to the

construction of icosahedral-like structures. Thus, since the inﬁnite crystal possesses the fcc

structure, the clear shell-construction in this size range will have to disappear again for

larger clusters.

In total, it can not surprise that when analysing the structures of the individual clusters

in detail we can identify many structural motifs that are characteristic for clusters of par-

ticularly high stability also for clusters with somewhat diﬀerent sizes. Moreover, such an

analysis54 shows also that many of our structures for the smaller N (these are the only ones

that have been the subject of earlier unbiased structure-optimizations) are close to those

that have been found in earlier studies. Here, however, we shall largely omit the discussion

of the individual structures but instead explore the more general trends.

In Fig. 8 we show some few quantities related to the structure of the clusters, i.e., coor-

dination numbers and average bond lengths. Here, we deﬁne two atoms as being bonded if
their interatomic distance is less than 3.00 ˚A, which is the average of the nearest-neighbor
distance (2.49 ˚A) and the next-nearest-neighbor distance (3.52 ˚A) in bulk Ni. Moreover,

we distinguish between inner atoms with a coordination number of 12 or larger and surface

atoms with a coordination number less than 12.

Fig. 8(a) shows the average coordination number as function of N, where an obvious

increase as function of size is observed, but with additional oscillations in particular for the

smallest clusters. This function shows clearly a saturation towards the bulk limit of 12,

although one has to remember that even for the largest cluster of our study 94 out of 150

atoms are characterized as surface atoms.

Fig. 8(b) shows the minimum atomic coordination for each cluster size from the range

N = 2−150, which is useful information for chemical-probe experiments due to the enhanced

chemical activity of clusters containing low-coordination atoms. In addition, the existence

of low-coordination atoms (i.e., coordinations of 3 or 4) could point to the occurrence of

a cluster growth, where extra atoms are added to the surface of the cluster, whereas the

higher minimum-atomic-coordination numbers (e.g. 5 or 6) could indicate a growth where

atoms are inserted inside the cluster, or, alternatively, upon a strong rearrangement of

the surface atoms. These considerations follow the so-called ”maximizing the minimum

coordination”.16,17

Fig. 8(c) shows the average bond length as function of cluster size. The dashed line
corresponds to the bulk value of 2.49 ˚A. The average bond length for all the structures with

the exception of Ni31, Ni35, Ni71, and Ni86 is smaller than the bulk value. Such a reduction

is in accordance with the results of most other theoretical studies, but it is interesting to

observe that this property approaches the bulk value faster than the other quantities of the

ﬁgure.

Important experimental work in the determination of the structure of individual NiN

clusters has been presented by Riley et al.30,31,32,33,34,35 using chemical-probe experiments.

Thereby, the number of N2 molecules that is bonded to a given cluster is determined, and in

order to relate this number to the structure of the cluster, the following empirical rules have

been formulated:30,31,32 (i) nickel atoms with a coordination of four and less will bind two

nitrogen molecules at saturation, (ii) nickel atoms with coordination of ﬁve to eight will bind

only one nitrogen molecule at saturation, (iii) nickel atoms with a coordination of nine will

bind one nitrogen molecule weakly or not at all (this kind of binding has not been observed32

for N > 49), and (iv) nickel atoms with a coordination more than nine do not bind any

nitrogen molecules. These rules allow us in turn to estimate the number of N2 molecules

that will bond to a given cluster. We stress that the chemical-probe experiments provide

information on the complete system, i.e., cluster plus adsorbants, whereas we consider the

naked clusters. Although this diﬀerence may result in some deviations between theory and

experiment, a comparison should give useful information on the clusters. This is supported

by the studies of Parks et al.30,31 that show that in many cases the structures of naked and

N2-covered clusters are very similar.

Doing so, we obtain the results of Fig. 9, where we also compare with the results of other

theoretical works. The experimental work covers the range 3 ≤ N ≤ 72, whereas the former

13

theoretical works cover 4 ≤ N ≤ 80 (Ref. [23]), 3 ≤ N ≤ 23 (Ref. [25]), and 24 ≤ N ≤ 55

(Ref. [17]), obtained using the Sutton-Chen potential,23 the Finnis-Sinclair potential,25 and

the eﬀective-medium theory.17 Fig. 9(a), where we show the results for the whole range of

our study, i.e., 2 ≤ N ≤ 150, shows an interesting aspect that obviously is beyond most

of the previous experimental and theoretical studies, i.e., that up to around N ≃ 55 the

number of binding sites increases more rapidly with N than for N above ∼55, i.e., the curve

is roughly two piecewise linear curves. The experimental studies [cf. Figs. 9(d) and (e)] do

in fact show a small tendency in this direction, which, on the other hand, is not found in the

earlier theoretical work [cf. Fig. 9(c)]. Figs. 9(b)-(e) show a comparison of the experimental

results with those of the four diﬀerent theoretical studies to this issue. It is clear that our

approach is at least as accurate as any of the other theoretical ones. Moreover, the Sutton-

Chen potential seems to predict a larger scatter of the number of binding sites as a function

of size compared to any other approach.

Whereas icosahedral motifs are found to play an important role for very many values

of N, we found that for N around 75 also other structural motifs are important. The

chemical-probe results for N2 uptake, both the experimental ones (notice, however, that the

experimental studies are limited to N ≤ 72) and the simulated, theoretical ones, suggest

also that in this range of N values more structural motifs compete: for these values of N the

results of Fig. 9 are particularly scattered. Moreover, as we shall see in the next subsection,

also growth processes suggest that these N values are special. Therefore, we shall study the

structural properties of those clusters in some more detail.

For cluster sizes ranging between 70 and 80 atoms two more closed-shell structures other

than icosahedral ones can be identiﬁed, i.e., the (2,2,2) Marks decahedron (giving a 75-atom

cluster) and a 79-atom fcc cluster, which is the truncated centered octahedron. Due to their

quasi-spherical shape they have a particularly low surface energy. Moreover, the cluster

sizes between 70 and 80 are very diﬀerent from the values of closed-shell icosahedral clusters

that have 55 or 147 atoms. Accordingly, one may expect a strong competition between

these three main morphologies in this size range. Our calculations support this suggestion.

Fig. 10 shows the lowest total energies for the decahedral and fcc clusters relative to the

icosahedral ones for 72 ≤ N ≤ 82. The Marks decahedron and its derivatives dominate over

the icosahedral structures for 73 ≤ N ≤ 79. At N = 79 both decahedral and fcc motifs

are more stable than the icosahedral one. The decahedron at N = 79 is only 0.04 eV more

14

stable than the truncated octahedron. Finally, three of four lowest-energy isomers at N = 75

are decahedra and for N = 76 − 78 there are only decahedral clusters among the four ﬁrst

isomers.

This result suggests that a fundamental structural change takes place for N around

75. This, however, is only partly the case: for larger N values the icosahedral packing is

again stabilized (an exception occurs for N around 104, where decahedral structures are

found). In order to verify this we computed the total energies for several optimized closed

fcc and decahedral structures, i.e., truncated noncentered octahedra for N = 116 and 140, a

noncentered octahedron and a (3,2,2) Marks decahedron for N = 146, and a cuboctahedron

and an Ino decahedron for N = 147. In all cases the icosahedral structures were found to

have lower total energies. The fcc clusters for N = 116, 140 and 146 and m-Dh146 were 0.85,

2.01, 5.64 and 2.29 eV, respectively, less stable than the icosahedral-like structures. The

three-shell Mackay icosahedron was 5.69 and 4.71 eV more stable than the cuboctahedron

and the Ino decahedron, accordingly. Thus, our calculations point strongly to icosahedral

growth up to cluster sizes of at least 150. This statement is supported by mass-spectroscopy

studies of nickel clusters37 which suggest icosahedral growth over a wide cluster-size region

from 50 to 800.

D. Growth patterns

One of the central issues is to identify how clusters grow, i.e., whether some fundamental

principles determine how (and whether) the cluster with N atoms is derived from the one

with N − 1 atoms. We shall here study this issue from a completely static point of view, i.e.,

dynamic and kinetic eﬀects, that most likely are important in experiment, will be neglected

here. Basic information about this issue is given by the structures of the magic clusters. The

majority of the structures of these are icosahedral. Thus our study supports predominantly

icosahedral growth of nickel clusters. There are two diﬀerent ways of icosahedral growth.

Thus, the ﬁrst Mackay icosahedron, Ih13, contains 20 triangular faces joined by 30 edges

and 12 vertices. In the ﬁrst case, MIC/Mackay or fcc covering,11,55,56,57,58 additional surface

atoms are placed on top of the edges and the vertices. This kind of growth results ultimately

in the second Mackay icosahedron, Ih55. Another possibility, the TIC/polyicosahedral11,55

or hcp or face-capping growth (see Ref. [56] and references therein), corresponds to adding

15

atoms on top of the atoms at the center of each face (T sites) which leads, after complete

covering, to the 45-atom rhombic tricontahedron. The TIC structures are the structures

with the shorter average bond length, but at the same time they possess the larger strain

energy. They are favored at the beginning of a covering until some critical size (depending

on details of the atom-atom interaction57,58) after which the MIC structures become lower

in energy.

To explain the icosahedral shell ﬁlling in Mg and Ca clusters Martin et al.60 proposed

the so-called umbrella model. According to this model enhanced stability is achieved each

time a vertex and its ﬁve surrounding faces are covered (capping umbrellas). The capping

umbrellas for MIC and TIC structures lead to diﬀerent magic numbers. By covering of Ih13

the MIC umbrellas are completed at N = 19, 24, 28, 32, 36, 39, 43, 46, 49 and 55, whereas

the TIC umbrellas give magic numbers for 19, 23, 26, 29, 32 and 34. Comparing with our

set of magic numbers (see above), we ﬁnd that growth from Ni13 to Ni27 is icosahedral and it

can be described according to the umbrella model. For N > 27 our magic numbers coincide

with the MIC magic ﬁgures. This conﬁrms seemingly the suggestion11 that at N = 27 there

is a transition from TIC to MIC growth. However, a detailed analysis of our structures

shows that our structures for Ni28.1 and Ni32.1 are not icosahedral. Instead, the most stable

icosahedral structure appears ﬁrst at N = 35 whereas the structures according to the MIC

growth or to fcc packing is found up to N = 56 with a single exception for N = 38. Thus the

transition from anti-Mackay to Mackay covering occurs in the region of cluster sizes from

28 to 34. Cluster growth in this range is complicated and there is a competition between

icosahedral, polyicosahedral and tetrahedral structure. Probably this non-trivial growth was

responsible for the diﬃculties in interpreting results of nitrogen-uptake experiments30,31,32

for 29 ≤ N ≤ 48.

At N = 55 we have the next complete icosahedron. According to the TIC growth model

we should then have magic number at N =58, 61, 64, 67, and 71,11 which is in excellent

agreement with our results. At N = 71 the TIC umbrella growth is completed. The MIC

umbrella growth is completed at N = 71, 83, 92, 101, 110, 116, 125, 131 and 137, again in

agreement with our calculated magic numbers.

Our study allows a more detailed analysis of possible growth processes that ultimately

will conﬁrm the complexity of the growth. Thus, in order to quantify whether the cluster of

N atoms is related to that of N − 1 atoms we consider ﬁrst the structure of the lowest total

16

energy for the (N − 1)-cluster. For this we calculate and sort all interatomic distances, di,
i = 1, 2, · · · , N (N −1)

. Subsequently we consider the N fragments of the N-cluster that can

2

be obtained by removing one of the atoms and keeping the rest at their positions. For each

of those we also calculate and sort all interatomic distances d′

i, and subsequently calculate

(ul = 1˚A) which approaches 1 if the NiN cluster is very similar to the NiN −1 cluster plus an

extra atom.

This function is shown in Fig. 11(a). We see indeed that for N up to around 40, S is

signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 1, giving support for the consensus that in this range the growth

is complicated. For larger N we see again that around N ≃ 75 some larger structural changes

take place. Fig. 3 shows, however, that the energetically lowest isomers diﬀer only little in

energy. Therefore, one may ask whether isomers with a slightly higher energy play a role

in the growth process. Accordingly, we examined whether the structure of the energetically

lowest isomer of NiN would resemble any of the four energetically lowest isomers for NiN −1 in

the same sense as above, i.e., we use the quantity q in quantifying the structural diﬀerence.

Out of the four diﬀerent values for q (for the four diﬀerent isomers) we choose the smallest

one and construct the similarity function from this. The resulting function is shown in

Fig. 11(b), and compared with Fig. 11(a) it is clearly seen that in particularly in the region

N > 50 the similarity function now approaches 1, except for the clusters around N = 70−75,

i.e., the region where we already in analysing other properties have found atypical behaviors.

In Fig. 11(c) we show which of the four energetically lowest isomers of NiN −1 leads to largest

similarity with the NiN cluster, and from the fact that this only for the smaller N most often

is the ﬁrst isomer, we learn that the growth process is a complicated process where more

diﬀerent isomers are important, i.e., not only the energetically most stable one, although

these may resemble each other (cf. Fig. 5). This means that it is diﬃcult to imagine that the

growth occurs as a one-by-one addition of atoms to the energetically most stable isomers.

17

V. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have determined the four energetically lowest isomers of nickel clusters

NiN in the range 2 ≤ N ≤ 150, using a combination of the embedded-atom method in

the version of Daw, Baskes and Foiles (for the calculation of the total energy for a given

structure), the variable metric/quasi-Newton method (for the determination of the closest

total-energy minimum), and our own Aufbau/Abbau method (for the determination of the

global total-energy minimum). Although the calculations provide structural information

for each individual cluster, separately,54 that may be useful information for experimental

studies, we have refrained from discussing these separately (some information is, however,

given in the Appendix), but instead focused on identifying general trends for NiN clusters,

and reducing the information on the individual clusters to some few key quantities like

total energy (per atom), overall symmetry and shape, average bond length and coordination

number, and similarity with other structures (fcc fragments, icosahedral clusters, or smaller

clusters).

Since our total-energy approach (the embedded-atom method) has its roots in arguments

for extended solids with delocalized atoms, we ﬁrst veriﬁed that it could be applied also

for the fairly open structures of our interest. We found that for the absolutely most ‘crit-

ical’ cases, i.e., the smallest clusters, our results are in excellent agreement with available

theoretical and experimental information making us believe that our approach is accurate.

Furthermore, we have also tried to use the parameterization of Voter and Chen61,62 of the

EAM, which has been produced in order to give accurate descriptions of also ﬁnite and more

open systems, for some of the smallest clusters. To our satisfaction, no structural changes

were found and, therefore, we did not pursue this approach.

Our study predicts a number of particularly stable clusters, i.e., magic numbers, which

in many cases are in agreement with the prediction of other studies and in some cases with

‘common expectations’ although we stress that in our study they were found in a completely

unbiased approach. These magic numbers were clearly visible both in the ‘stability function’

and in the total-energy diﬀerence between the energetically lowest and higher-lying isomers,

whereas for the energetically higher-lying isomers, the diﬀerences in the total energy become

small.

We found also that even for large values of N (above 2500) the total energy per atom

18

has still not converged to the bulk limit. Similarly, the average coordination number is for

clusters with N around 150 still far from the bulk limit, whereas the average bond length

has come close to the bulk limit for this size.

In order to study the structural properties we analysed the eigenvalues of the matrix

containing the moments of inertia and introduced so-called similarity functions. The latter

indicated that all the four isomers we have studied here are very similar in most cases, and

that roughly spherical clusters were found mainly for the energetically lowest isomer but in

some cases also for the second-lowest one, and that these often correspond to particularly

stable structures. With the similarity functions we could identify clusters with a predom-

inantly icosahedral structure and such with an essentially fcc-like structure. Whereas the

former occurred for N around 13, 55, and 147, the latter was found, e.g., for N around 79.

It was interesting to see that these structural motifs were built up over a larger range of N

values and were, accordingly, not limited to those singular values of N.

By analysing the distribution of radial distances as a function of cluster size we could

identify certain size regions, e.g., N around 50, 75, 115, and above 140, where shell structures

were clearly recognizable. This property, as well as several others, showed, furthermore, that

all four isomers for a given N have very similar structures.

Chemical-probe experiments have been used in identifying the structure of the individual

clusters, and for this we found an excellent agreement. Our study shows that for clusters

with N around 50–60, a change occurs, so that above this size the number of N2 binding

sites depends much weaker on N than below this size. This change is just on the boarder

of the cluster sizes that have been studied experimentally and theoretically so far.

We used the magic numbers in analysing diﬀerent models for cluster-growth processes.

Generally, the cluster growth is according to multilayered-icosahedral or layer-by-layer

growth. We found that the one-, two-, and three-shell Mackay icosahedra are the most

stable structures for 13-, 55-, and 147-atom nickel clusters (the latter for the ﬁrst time

in unbiased studies). This result agrees well with the suggestion in Ref. 59 that Mackay

icosahedra are the most stable structures up to N = 2300. But the cluster-growth pattern

between two closed-shell icosahedra is not simple. It is predominantly icosahedral with is-

lands of fcc growth for Ni6, Ni38, tetrahedral for Ni28 and decahedral for Ni73-N79 and Ni104.

For 14 ≤ N ≤ 27 the growth is polyicosahedral. Moreover, we found a growth according to

hcp/anti-Mackay for 57 ≤ N ≤ 72 and for 148 ≤ N ≤ 150. From N = 35 to N = 56 (with

19

the exception of N = 38) and from N = 80 to N = 147 (except for N = 104) the MIC

cluster growth was found. Thus, the change-over from the hcp-type of cluster growth to the

fcc one always happens within a transition region of cluster sizes and not immediately.

Moreover, whereas the growth process only with diﬃculties could be identiﬁed for the

smaller N (due to the lack of similarity between the clusters), for larger N we found that not

only the energetically lowest isomers could be important in describing the growth. Thus,

for all ranges of N, the growth is non-trivial.

A special case is that for N around 75. More diﬀerent properties suggested that in this

range special things occur. Analysing the total energy for diﬀerent structures in this size

range we found indeed that more structures were energetically close and, accordingly, would

play a role for those clusters. Therefore, for these values of N there is a rapid and dramatic

change in structure as a function of N.

ferent experimental and theoretical studies. EAM, TBMD, FS, SC, AI, EMT, nG, and exp denotes

Embedded-Atom calculations, tight-binding molecular-dynamics calculations, Finnis-Sinclair po-

tential, Sutton-Chen potential, ab initio calculations, eﬀective-medium-theory calculations, many-

body Gupta potential, and experiment, respectively. For some values of N , more diﬀerent meta-

stable isomers have been found, and they have then been characterized by an additional number

(e.g., 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4, with 7.1 being the stabler one, 7.2 the second-most stable one, a.s.o.)

FIG. 5: Diﬀerent properties related to the eigenvalues Iαα. In the upper panel we show the average

value together with points indicating whether clusters with overall spherical shape (lowest set of

rows), overall cigar shape (middle set of rows), or overall lens shape (upper set of rows) are found

for a certain size. Moreover, in each set of rows, the lowest row corresponds to the energetically

lowest isomer, the second one to the energetically second-lowest isomer, etc. In the lower panel we

show the maximum diﬀerence of the eigenvalues for the four diﬀerent isomers.

31

FIG. 6: Each panel shows the similarity function for all four isomers when comparing with (a)

an icosahedral cluster, and (b–d) a spherical fragment of the fcc crystal when the center of the

fragment is placed at (b) the position of an atom, (c) the middle of a nearest-neighbor bond, and

(d) the center of the cube, respectively.

32

FIG. 7: Each panel shows the radial distances (in ˚A) as a function of cluster size, i.e., each small

line represents (at least) one atom with that radial distance. The energy of the isomers increases

from the top to the bottom.

Abstract

We analyze the nature of the rotational energy level structure of the OCS-He and
OCS-H2 complexes with a comparison of exact calculations to several diﬀerent dy-
namical approximations. We compare with the clamped coordinate quasiadiabatic
approximation that introduces an eﬀective potential for each asymmetric rotor level,
with an eﬀective rotation Hamiltonian constructed from ground state averages of
the inverse of the inertial matrix, and investigate the usefulness of the Eckart condi-
tion to decouple rotations and vibrations of these weakly bound complexes between
linear OCS and 4He or H2. Comparison with exact results allows an assessment of
the accuracies of the diﬀerent approximate methods and indicates which approaches
are suitable for larger clusters of OCS with 4He and with H2. We ﬁnd the OCS-
H2 complex is considerably more rigid than the OCS-He complex, suggesting that
semi-rigid models are useful for analysis of larger clusters of H2 with OCS.

1 Introduction

Until recently, Helium-4 has been the only known boson superﬂuid liquid.
Many aspects of superﬂuidity have been studied experimentally, phenomeno-
logically, and theoretically. These include its relation to Bose-Einstein conden-
sation, the temperature dependence of the superﬂuid fraction in the 2-ﬂuid
model, the ﬁnite size-dependence and the inﬂuence of atomic and molecular
impurities in 4He on the superﬂuid fraction. The latter two issues have raised
new, interesting and more basic questions. In particular, what is the validity

of phenomenological models on a microscopic scale, and how should we de-
tect superﬂuidity of small systems. These questions ultimately demand a full
microscopic understanding of superﬂuidity.

Rovibrational IR spectroscopy experiments with chromophores in helium
droplets [1,2] have conﬁrmed superﬂuid behavior for systems as small as
approximately 60 4He atoms [3] by observing the free rotation of the OCS
molecule. Subsequently, a new ﬁeld of research has been opened by similar
experiments in small para-hydrogen clusters embedded in low temperature
helium droplets.[4] Spectroscopic experiments on OCS in these hydrogen clus-
ters show spectroscopic anomalies which have been interpreted as indicating
the existence of superﬂuidity of para-H2 for clusters small enough to be ﬂuid-
like rather than forming a solid shell around the chromophore. These conclu-
sions have recently been veriﬁed by path integral calculations showing that an
anistropic superﬂuid fraction appears at low temperatures (T < 0.3 K).[5]
In addition, new experimental studies on very small complexes with less
than one solvation shell of 4He or H2 obtained rotational/rovibrational ex-
citation energies for complexes of well-deﬁned size, OCS-pH2 and OCS-4HeN ,
N = 1, . . . , 8.[6,7,8,9,10] New theoretical work for small OCS-4HeN complexes
[11] show an interesting transition from semi-rigid rotation of the whole clus-
ter for small N to partial decoupling of the 4He motion and the OCS rotation
for increasing N. As explained in detail in Ref. [11], this implies a transition
from a molecular complex to quantum solvation.

Quantitative microscopic calculation of the spectrum of excitation energies of
OCS-(pH2)N and OCS-4HeN clusters is an important step towards the under-
standing of the rovibrational spectra of these unusual clusters. For N ≫ 1,
this is still an extremely demanding task with current methodological and
computational capabilities. Exact excitation energies are often not accessible
and it is therefore necessary to make use of dynamical approximations, based
whenever possible on existing knowledge of e.g. small cluster structures or
on microscopic understanding of quantum solvation structures. In this paper,
we therefore present a survey of approximate methods for the calculation of
rotational energies of small Van der Waal complexes that have potential ap-
plication to large quantum clusters of OCS in 4He and in H2. In order to be
able to critically assess the various approximations by comparing with exact
results, we focus here on the smallest case, N = 1.

The methods we employ here are all based on diﬀusion Monte Carlo (DMC)
sampling. Our focus on DMC methods derives from their suitability for ap-
plication to larger sizes that are beyond the scope of basis set approaches.
DMC yields exact results for ground state energies and the approximations
employed here all take advantage of this. The approximate methods all assume
some degree of rigidity, an assumption which we expect would progressively
fail to be justiﬁed as one would go to larger clusters, with helium failing at

2

smaller cluster size than hydrogen. In section 3 we give an overview of how to
calculate approximate rotational excitations. We described the clamped coor-
dinate quasiadiabatic approximation of Quack and Suhm [12], a modiﬁcation
of it which incorporates the Eckart condition [13] for semi-rigid complexes,
and a perturbative calculation of rotational constants following Ref. [14]. In
section 4, we compare these results with the exact bound state energies deter-
mined by the program BOUND [15]. We discuss here also the relative rigidity
of the OCS-He and OCS-H2 systems as apparent from the grouping of exact
energy levels into (ro)vibrational and rotational subsets, where “vibrational”
from now refers to the radial motion of H2 or 4He with respect to OCS. Sec-
tion 5 summarizes and provides conclusions.

2 Ground state

The dimers OCS-pH2 and OCS-4He are weakly bound van der Waals com-
plexes which demand a full quantum mechanical calculation of the 4He degrees
of freedom, due to their large zero-point motion. Exact methods [16,17,15] are
available to determine ground and excited states of the dimers. However, we
are interested in larger clusters OCS-(H2)N and OCS-4HeN , with special fo-
cus on the inﬂuence of the superﬂuid properties of the solvation shell around
OCS [18,19]. For this reason, in this paper we employ diﬀusion Monte Carlo
(DMC) which is applicable to large systems of sizes on the order of N = 100,
and compare with the result of exact calculations for N = 1.

The theory and implementation of DMC has been described extensively in the
literature [20,21,22]. We employ here a mixed branching-weighting algorithm.
Reliable interaction potentials V between OCS and 4He, and H2 (assumed
spherical), respectively, have been calculated by Higgins et.al. [6,23]. Addi-
tional interaction potentials are available for the OCS-He system [24,25]. Fig. 1
shows cuts of the OCS-H2 and two OCS-He potentials along the minimum en-
ergy path. In order to minimize computational cost in DMC, all potentials
were expanded in Legendre polynomials and the resulting expansion coeﬃ-
cients interpolated with splines. This is responsible for the small irregularities
in the lower panel of Fig. 1, but we have veriﬁed that these do not aﬀect our
results. In this work we will not be concerned with the determination and
quality of the potentials in regard to experimental measurements, and shall
therefore start our investigation with the given Hamiltonian

where mX = m(H2) and m(4He), B is the rotational constant of free OCS in

its ground state, and M its mass. ∂ϕx and ∂ϕy are the inﬁnitesimal angles
of rotation of the principal axis frame of OCS, r ≡ |rX − r0| is the distance
between atom and center of mass of OCS, and θ the angle between the OCS
axis and the location of the atom. We employ the rigid body diﬀusion Monte
Carlo algorithm[26,27] in which the rotational degrees of freedom ϕx and ϕy
are sampled by random walks in the angular variable taken in the principal
axis frame of the molecule. Although it is not essential for a system of only 8
coordinates (rX, r0, ϕx, ϕy), of which only r and u ≡ cos θ enter in the potential
calculation, we employ biased DMC here, sampling the state Φ0ΦT instead of
Φ0, with the trial wave function

ΦT (r, u) = exp h a1rα + (t1 + η1(u − u1)2) log
+ (t2 + η2r2(u − u2)2)eη−cr

which is ﬂexible enough also for N > 1 complexes. The parameters of ΦT are
chosen to approximately minimize the energy expectation value, and are given
in table 1. This trial function has both angular and radial dependence, and
thus it requires the full rotational importance sampled algorithm developed
in Ref. [27]. Importance-sampled DMC yields exact values for the ground
state energy and also for expectation values of operators commuting with
the Hamiltonian. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all expectation values of opera-
tors not commuting with the Hamiltonian are computed here with descendent
weighting [28] implemented according to the procedure for pure estimator of
Ref. [29]. This corrects the mixed expectation values that result from impor-
tance sampling (i.e., averages over the product Φ0ΦT ) by a factor of Φ0/ΦT
to obtain the exact expectation value over Φ2
0. This is particularly important
for structural quantities.

3 Methods for Rotational excitations

Since DMC transforms the Schr¨odinger equation to a diﬀusion equation whose
asymptotic solution is the ground state, DMC is often very eﬃcient for the
calculation of ground state properties while imposing only a small well con-
trollable time step bias. The situation is quite diﬀerent for excited states.
Exact calculation of excitation energies is possible with the projection opera-
tion imaginary time spectral evolution approach (POITSE) which is generally
very time-consuming.[30,31] Alternatively, excited states can be calculated
with ﬁxed node approximations, but these generally introduce an unknown
amount of bias by the choice of nodal surfaces[31]. The methods described
below share the element of approximation with ﬁxed node in the sense that
they are approximative, but possess the advantage that it is very straightfor-

4

ward and can be implemented with the same eﬃciency as ground state energy
calculations.

3.1 Clamped coordinate quasiadiabatic approximation (ccQA)

We summarize here the procedure which Quack and Suhm [12] introduced to
calculate rotational levels of the van der Waals dimer (HF)2. The rigid-rotor
Hamiltonian Hrot of the instantaneous conﬁguration R at diﬀusion time t is
obtained by diagonalizing the associated instantaneous inertial tensor I. For
OCS-XN , its elements in the body ﬁxed frame of OCS are

Iαβ =

(δα,β − δα,3δβ,3) + X

mi(δα,βri − xα

i xβ
i )

i

Pγ xγ

i . Diagonalization yields principal values IA, IB, and IC, and
with ri =
hence the rotational constants A = ¯h/8π2cIA, B = ¯h/8π2cIB, C = ¯h/8π2cIC.
For N = 1 these should correspond to those of an asymmetric top for both
He and H2 complexes, as seen experimentally [7,8]. For given total angular
momentum J, the resulting rigid-rotor cluster Hamiltonian is

Hrot = A ˆJ 2

x + B ˆJ 2

y + C ˆJ 2
z .

This is diagonalized in a symmetric rotor basis,[32] resulting in eigenenergies
ǫJ,τ , τ = −J, . . . , J. Since Hrot depends parametrically on the conﬁguration
R, the energies ǫJ,τ are also parametrically dependent on R. As pointed out
by Quack and Suhm in Ref. [12], they can therefore be regarded as providing
eﬀective centrifugal potentials, VJ,τ (R) = ǫJ,τ , which may be added to the clus-
ter Hamiltonian (1) to yield an eﬀective Hamiltonian for diﬀerent rotational
states of the cluster as a whole:

HJ,τ (R) = H(R) + VJ,τ (R).

(3)

(4)

Because the Hamiltonians H(R) and HJ,τ (R) diﬀer only by the centrifugal
potential terms, implementation of correlated sampling [33,34] on all systems
HJ,τ (R) with a single random walk, but employing diﬀerent individual weights
is comparatively straightforward. Each system results in an excitation energy
EJ,τ , where these are the ground state energies of the respective eﬀective
Hamiltonians. The ground state energy E0 can be calculated inexpensively
together with all excitation energies EJ,τ in the single DMC run.

5

3.2 Eckart frame ccQA (EccQA)

The diagonalization of the moment of inertia tensor I at every (imaginary
time) instant t amounts to choosing the principal axis of I as the instanta-
neous molecule ﬁxed axis system, which thus moves with the motion of the
generalized coordinate R. However, the axis system which separates rotational
and small vibrational motion most eﬀectively is the Eckart frame [13] and this
is the preferred axis system for the derivation of rovibrational Hamiltonians.
Therefore, we modify the above ccQA prescription in the following manner to
accommodate the preferred Eckart reference frame.

(1) Instead of diagonalizing the instantaneous inertial tensor I (which is of
course independent of the axis system used), we calculate the components
Ii,j in the Eckart frame and invert this matrix.

(2) Instead of solving for the eigenvalues of the asymmetric top Hamiltonian

(3), we solve for the eigenvalues ǫJ,τ of

Hrot = X

i,j

(I −1)i,j ˆJi ˆJj

This Hamiltonian is also used in the method described in the next section.

For the determination of the instantaneous Eckart frame, a reference geometry
needs to be speciﬁed. In the case of OCS-X, it can be speciﬁed by the position
of X with respect to the OCS center of mass and molecular axis, rref and
cos θref . As reference values of these coordinates, we choose the ground state
expectation values rref = hri and cos θref = hcos θi. For OCS-H2 and OCS-4He
we ﬁnd these expectation values are given by rref = 3.704˚A and 3.935˚A, and
θref = 105.7◦ and 108.4◦, respectively.

3.3 Rotational constants from ground state averages (GSA)

For semi-rigid molecules, rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom can
be treated in a Born-Oppenheimer approximation in which the Hamiltonian
is averaged over the rotational ground state. This is achieved by deﬁning an
eﬀective rotational Hamiltonian H eﬀ
rot

H eﬀ

rot = X

i,j

hΨ0|(I ′−1)i,j|Ψ0i ˆJi ˆJj

(5)

where I ′
i,j are components of the eﬀective inertial tensor (see Refs. [14,35])
calculated in the Eckart frame (x, y, z). We use the deﬁnition of of the Eckart
frame axes given in Ref. [14], with interchange of y and z. Since for small

6

amplitude vibrations I ′ diﬀers only slightly from the pure inertial tensor I, we
have followed Ref. [14] and also calculated hΨ0|(I −1)i,j|Ψ0i. For OCS-X, the
eﬀective rotational Hamiltonian (5) takes the form

H eﬀ

rot = A ˆJ 2

x + B ˆJ 2

y + C ˆJ 2

z + D( ˆJx ˆJy + ˆJy ˆJx)

(6)

where y is deﬁned as the axis perpendicular to the OCS-X plane. The explicit
expressions for A, B, C, and D are given in Ref. [14]. Rotational energies are
then obtained by expanding H eﬀ
rot in the symmetric rotor basis and diagonal-
izing the matrix. As noted already above in Section 2, we compute the exact
ground state expectation values in Eq. (5) by descendant weighting of the
importance sampling, in order to remove the trial wave function bias.

By an ad hoc combination of ccQA and GSA, one can also calculate rotational
constants from (approximate) excited state averages in a similar fashion and
use these to go back and calculate rotational energies. The procedure is as
follows. First, sample an approximate excited state corresponding to (J, τ )
deﬁned by the eﬀective Hamiltonian Eq. (4) of the ccQA approach explained in
section 3.1. Second, calculate the rotational constants A, B, C, D as averages
over these approximate excited states, i.e., hΨJ,τ | ˆA|ΨJ,τ i etc. This needs to
be done also with descendent weighting to correct for the trial function bias.
Third, diagonalize H eﬀ
rot to obtain an updated estimate of the excitation energy
EJ,τ . We found that this ad hoc estimate turned out to be inferior to the ccQA
results for both complexes, OCS-(H2) and OCS-4He.

4 Results

We have applied the DMC-based approximate methods described above to
the calculation of rotational excitation energies and rotational constants for
OCS-(H2) and OCS-4He and compared with the exact energies which we have
determined using the program BOUND [15]. To relate the exact reference
energies to rotational constants, we ﬁtted the BOUND rotational energies to
the eigenenergies of the Watson A-reduced Hamiltonian.[36] In case of the
GSA calculation, the resulting rotational parameters A, B, C, D are used to
construct the eﬀective Hamiltonian (6) which we then diagonalized to obtain
rotational energies.

In all calculations reported here, the imaginary time step value in the DMC
walk was dt/¯h = 0.00011cm for OCS-(H2) and dt/¯h = 0.00022cm for OCS-
4He.

Fig. 2 shows the respective ground state densities of H2 and 4He with respect to
OCS, ρ(r, θ). These densities are obtained by simply binning the coordinates of

7

H2 and 4He in the body ﬁxed frame of OCS in an unbiased DMC calculation,
i.e. with trial function ΦT = 1, and then squaring the amplitude. The densities
are qualitatively quite similar for the two complexes, with the helium density
being somewhat more delocalized. In particular, we note that 4He has a non-
negligible probability to reside near the south pole of OCS (the oxygen end,
at negative z). This leads us to expect that a semi-rigid approximation for
OCS-4He might be problematic.

4.1 Exact excitation energies from BOUND

Fig. 3 summarizes the exact and quasi-adiabatic energy levels for OCS com-
plexed with H2 (top panel), and for OCS complexed with 4He (middle and
bottom panels). The exact energy levels are shown as horizontal bars. For the
helium complex, we show the results from two diﬀerent OCS-He potentials,
namely the MP4 potential of Higgins and Klemperer [6] (middle panel) and the
HHDSD potential of Gianturco and Paesani [24] (bottom panel). The ground
state energy of OCS-H2 is -74.59 cm−1 and of OCS-4He is -16.38 cm−1 (MP4) /
-15.85 cm−1 (HHDSD). The exact results for OCS-H2 show a very well-deﬁned
energetic separation between the low energy rotational states and the higher
energy states associated with the vibrational motion of the H2 molecule in the
OCS-H2 potential. For low values of J, the total angular momentum, these two
diﬀerent sets of states are separated by ∼ 25 cm−1. This separation decreases
as J increases and the rovibrational and purely rotational states are expected
to mix, but even for J = 6, the highest value shown here, there is still a clear
separation of ∼ 5 cm−1 between the highest rotational sublevel and the ﬁrst
rovibrational level.

These results indicate that OCS-H2 can be described as a rigid rotor and sug-
gests that dynamic approximations based on such an assumption will provide
a good starting point for e.g., analyzing energy levels in larger clusters. This
situation changes considerably for the lighter OCS-He complex. With both the
MP4 potential (middle) and even more so with the HHDSD potential (bot-
tom) we ﬁnd the energy separation between rotational and vibration levels
greatly reduced. For small J, this separation is only ∼ 8 cm−1 with the MP4
potential, and further decreases to ∼ 4 cm−1 with the HHDSD potential. This
smaller separation between the purely rotational and rovibrational levels for
the helium complex can be ascribed to the weaker interaction between OCS
and 4He.

The energetic spread of the rotational sublevels τ is also diﬀerent between the
two systems, with the helium complex levels being compressed relative to the
corresponding levels in the hydrogen complex levels: the lighter mass of H2
results in a large rotational constant A compared to B and C, which leads

8

to a steeper increase of the rotational energy with increasing τ = Ka − Kc,
i.e. for large Ka, which approximately corresponds to the fast rotation of H2
about a tumbling OCS.

However, this smaller spread for the helium complex is clearly outweighed by
the decrease in rovibrational energies. As a result of the smaller gap between
rotational and rovibrational energies for OCS-He, a mixing of rotational and
rovibrational levels is predicted at J ≥ 4 for the HHDSD potential (bottom
panel), and at J ≥ 5 for the MP4 potential (middle panel). In comparison,
for the OCS-H2 complex the mixing does not occur until J = 7. The onset of
this mixing of rovibrational and rotational levels at small J values is another
indicator of non-rigid, “ﬂoppy”, behavior, seen here in the extreme for the
helium complex. Therefore, from energy consideration, pure rotations cannot
be distinguished from rovibrations at large values of the total angular quantum
number J.

Table 3 and 4 list the parameters of the Watson A-reduced Hamiltonian ob-
tained by ﬁtting the energy levels obtained from the BOUND calculations to
the following Watson A-reduced form:

For comparison we show the corresponding experimental values of these pa-
rameters as determined spectroscopically in Refs. [7] and [8]. These were ob-
tained by ﬁtting to energy levels reaching up to J = 6, but still lying below the
rovibrational levels. These tables provide a reference for the rotational con-
stants derived from the approximate methods, described below, and provide
a measure of the accuracy of the three potentials [6,23,24] considered in this
work. Both complexes are ﬁt by asymmetric top parameters.

4.2 Rotational energies from ccQA and Eckart modiﬁcation (EccQA)

Both the assumption of separation of vibrational and rotational motion that
is central to the ccQA approach, and the resulting eﬀective Hamiltonian (5)
break down when the respective vibrational and rotational energies are of
similar magnitude. Thus from Fig. 3 and the discussion of the exact ener-
gies above, it appears that ccQA approach should break down at J ∼ 4 − 5
for the helium complex, and at J ∼ 7 for the hydrogen complex. The GSA
calculation is also expected to fail at these J values. Furthermore, neither of
these approaches can yield the higher rovibrational states, where, in addition

9

to the rotation of the complex, the H2 or 4He atom also vibrates radially
with respect to the OCS molecule. To obtain estimates for the energies of
these excited states possessing both vibrational and rotational character, one
would need to sample the various excited vibrational states for J = 0 (e.g., by
imposing nodal constraints on the trial wave function [37,12], and then add
the centrifugal potential VJ,τ (R) to the Hamiltonian (1) as described above
to obtain vibrationally excited states with J > 0. Since this would introduce
more approximations, we refrained here from trying to obtain the rovibrational
excitation energies with ccQA beyond the pure rotational energies.

The ccQA energies for OCS-H2 and OCS-He are shown as crosses in Fig. 3.
They generally track the corresponding asymmetric top rotational energy lev-
els, showing the greatest accuracy for the more rigid OCS-H2 complex, and
larger deviations for the more ﬂoppy OCS-He complex. For comparison, we
have plotted as a continuous dotted line the quadratic behavior of the en-
ergy levels of free OCS, i.e., BJ(J + 1), with B = 0.2028 cm−1. [18] It is
notable that while both complexes are asymmetric tops, the free molecule line
does nevertheless track the lowest set of rotational levels for OCS-H2, while
for OCS-He the lowest rotational levels lie considerably lower than the free
molecule values. In Figs. 4a, 4b, and 5, we show the error of the ccQA and
EccQA calculations of rotational levels with respect to the exact BOUND en-
ergies, ∆EJ,τ = EJ,τ ((E)ccQA) − EJ,τ (BOUND), for values of J where pure
rotational levels can still be identiﬁed. Not surprisingly, the errors introduced
by the (E)ccQA approximation are larger for the less rigid OCS-4He complex,
see the larger y scale in Fig. 5, relative to Fig. 4a. Nevertheless, the deviations
of (E)ccQA from the exact energies are still quite small in both cases, consider-
ing that both dimers, especially OCS-4He, experience large zero-point motion
(see Fig. 2). Comparing now the original quasi-adiabatic approach (ccQA,
closed symbols in Figs. 4a, 4b, and 5) with the Eckart modiﬁcation (EccQA,
open symbols), we see that the introduction of the Eckart reference frame
does not improve the accuracy of the results. For completeness, we also have
compared the relative errors for OCS-He when the two diﬀerent potentials are
used, MP4 and HHDSD (not shown). Since the HHDSD interaction is less
anisotropic, Fig. 1, and allows for larger zero-point motion of the 4He atom,
the (E)ccQA approximation yields poorer results with th HHDSD interaction
than with the MP4 interaction, by up to a factor of two for J = 1 − 3.

Fig. 6 shows the mean distance hri of H2 and 4He, respectively, from OCS
for the rotational excited states (J, τ ), obtained in the ccQA approximation.
Although hri spans a smaller range for OCS-H2 due to the larger rigidity, hri
rises more steeply with τ = Ka − Kc, because of the high energies involved
with the quantum number Ka (see the comment above about the larger spread
in energies evident in Fig. 3).

4.3 GSA

The four rotational parameters of the ground state eﬀective Hamiltonian H eﬀ
rot,
eq. (6), are tabulated in Table 5. Comparison with the ﬁts to the exact energy
levels shown in Tables 3 and 4 show that using the pure inertial tensor I
instead of the eﬀective inertial tensor I ′ tends to improve the agreement with
the values of the asymmetric top rotational constants A, B, C from ﬁtting to
the BOUND results. We note that, other than for the ccQA approximation,
GSA rotational constants are sensitive to the choice of axis system, and the
Eckart conditions may not be neglected.

The deviations of the eigenenergies of H eﬀ
rot from the exact rotational energies
are shown in Figs. 7a, 7b, and 8 for OCS-(H2) and OCS-4He, respectively.
Comparison with Figs. 4a and 4b shows that, for OCS-H2, the GSA devia-
tions are of similar magnitude as those of the ccQA approximation, with GSA
doing slightly better for smaller J than ccQA and vice versa for larger J. For
OCS-4He, the deviations of GSA increase faster with J. Also, table 5 shows
that, just like ccQA, GSA is less accurate for OCS-4He than for OCS-(H2).
There is a small, but ﬁnite probability for the 4He atom to be close to the oxy-
gen side, along the OCS axis, i.e. OCS-4He vibrating end-over-end. For these
conﬁgurations, the rotational constants A, C(C ′), and D diverge, leading to
poor statistics in the DMC calculation.

5 Conclusions

We have compared the exact rotational excitation energies of the weakly
bound Van der Waals complexes OCS-paraH2 and OCS-4He with two approxi-
mate methods, namely, the clamped coordinate quasiadiabatic approximation
(ccQA) and ground state averages of the rotational constants (GSA), as well as
with variants of each of these methods. The purpose of this survey is to assess
which approximate methods will work best for larger complexes OCS-(H2)N
and OCS-4HeN , in the absence of non-stochastic exact techniques.

While for the GSA approach, fulﬁlling the Eckart condition improves the re-
sults considerably, we found no signiﬁcant improvement of the ccQA results
when the instantaneous inertial frame is replaced by the Eckart frame (Ec-
cQA). This is good news for larger size clusters, since incorporating the Eckart
condition brings with it the need to deﬁne a reference structure, which would
become increasingly cumbersome and less tractable for growing N. We also
found that incorporation of a centrifugal correction in the instantaneous in-
ertial matrix in the GSA method (Section 3.3) actually tends to degrade the
accuracy of the excitation energies. This is in agreement with the ﬁndings of

11

Ref. [14].

A signiﬁcant physical feature that emerged from comparison of the complete
energy spectrum of rotational and rovibrational states for the two complexes of
OCS with H2 and with He, is the greater rigidity of the hydrogen complex, as
evident from the larger separation between purely rotational and rovibrational
states. This was evident from surveying the overall pattern of energy levels,
Fig. 3. Experimental investigation of vibrationally excited states for OCS-
H2 and OCS-4He would be useful, because their energies are most sensitive
to the potential surface V (r, cos θ) at higher energies and larger r values.
This diﬀerentiation in rigidity apparent from examination of the excited state
spectrum is particularly interesting given the close similarity of the ground
state densities for the two complexes (Fig. 2).

A detailed projection for the breakdown of the assumption of separability of
vibrational and rotational excitations in the multi-particle complexes OCS-
XN , N > 1, is of course diﬃcult, because exact results for all excited state
energies are currently impossible to obtain for large N. However, the projection
operator imaginary time spectral evolution approach (POITSE) can provide
exact energies given a good trial wave function. It yields the energies of selected
rotational states, where the selection is determined by the choice of a projector
acting on the ground state. POITSE calculations [11] of rotational excitations
of OCS-4HeN for N ≤ 20 show approximate agreement with ccQA results
for N ≤ 5 and J = 1, with the ccQA results lying always somewhat lower
than the POITSE results. This agreement with exact calculations indicates
that the rigid coupling approximation underlying the ccQA approximation is
good in this regime. For larger N, the POITSE rotational energy saturates
in accordance with experimental results, while the energies obtained in ccQA
and GSA monotonically decrease for increasing N. This implies that not all
4He atoms in the ﬁrst solvation shell can rigidly follow the OCS rotation, as
discussed extensively in Ref. [19] and demonstrated explicitly in Ref. [11].

MP4 by Higgins et.al. [6] (squares are ab initio points from that reference)
and HHDSD by Gianturco et.al. [24] (dashed line). For usage in the DMC
simulations, all potentials have been interpolated from the ab initio data points
by splines in radial direction and by expansion in Legendre polynomials in
angular direction, see Ref. [24].

The structural and bonding properties of small neutral alkali-halide clusters, (AX)n with n ≤ 10,
A = Li+, N a+, K +, Rb+ and X = F −, Cl−, Br−, I −, are studied using the ab initio Perturbed Ion
(PI) model and a restricted structural relaxation criterion. A trend of competition between rock-
salt and hexagonal ring-like isomers is found and discussed in terms of the relative ionic sizes. The
main conclusion is that an approximate value of rC/rA = 0.5 (where rC and rA are the cationic
and anionic radii) separates the hexagonal from the rock-salt structures. The classical electrostatic
part of the total energy at the equilibrium geometry is enough to explain these trends. The magic
numbers in the size range studied are n = 4, 6 and 9, and these are universal since they occur for
all alkali-halides and do not depend on the speciﬁc ground state geometry. Instead those numbers
allow for the formation of compact clusters. Full geometrical relaxations are considered for (LiF )n
(n = 3 − 7) and (AX)3 clusters, and the eﬀect of Coulomb correlation is studied in a few selected
cases. These two eﬀects preserve the general conclusions achieved thus far.

I. INTRODUCTION

Small clusters often present signiﬁcant physical and chemical diﬀerences with respect to the bulk phase. While
the structural possibilities are limited for the bulk material, the number of diﬀerent isomers which may coexist for
clusters is usually large, and the energy diﬀerences between isomers are often small. Here we are interested in neutral
stoichiometric clusters of typical materials with ionic bonding, that is (AX)n clusters, where A is an alkali and X a
halide atom. As ab initio studies on these clusters are computationally expensive, the ﬁrst theoretical calculations
were based on pairwise interaction models1–3. Meanwhile, experimentalists moved forward using several techniques
to produce and investigate these clusters: particle sputtering4,5, where rare-gas ions are used to bombard a crystal
surface, vapor condensation in an inert-gas atmosphere6–8, and laser vaporization of a crystal surface9,10.
In the
expanding molecular jet conditions, clusters undergo a rapid and eﬃcient evaporative cooling, and this leads to a
cluster size distribution determined almost exclusively by the cluster stability. The evaporative cooling process leads
to the so-called abundance magic numbers as a result of the longer time that the most stable clusters remain in the
beam before decaying. Alkali halide magic numbers are often explained in terms of cuboid structures resembling
fragments of the crystalline lattice, but other possibilities like ring stackings, or even mixed structures exist, which
could be competitive. Nevertheless, only recently the possibility of detecting diﬀerent isomers has emerged in drift tube
experiments11,12. Those experiments have led to a renewed interest in isomerization studies. In order to disentangle
these interesting problems, ab initio calculations13–16 provide an ideal complement to the experimental studies, which
are restricted to charged species. For instance, a study of (KCl)n and (LiF )n clusters up to sizes of n = 32 has
been carried out in ref. 16, using quantum-chemical methods including correlation eﬀects at the MP2 level. We have
performed calculations for (N aCl)n and (N aI)n using the ab initio Perturbed Ion (PI) model13,14.

The objective of the present paper is to give a global characterization of the structure and other related properties
of small neutral alkali halide clusters. To this end we have carried out extensive PI calculations for the (AX)n
(n = 1 − 10) clusters, identifying the most stable isomers, the binding energy diﬀerences between some isomers, and
the evolution of several properties with the cluster size. Trends are highlighted and diﬀerences between diﬀerent
materials are discussed. To obtain a more profound insight on the physics behind the observed trends, the (AX)6
clusters are studied in more detail. Thus, conclusions can be drawn as to what energy components dictate the structure
of the ground state isomer. Direct contact with the results of drift tube experiments is yet premature since those
experiments involve nonstoichiometric singly-charged clusters.

This paper is structured as follows: Section II contains a brief account of the theoretical method and computational
details. Section III contains the results for the structure and bonding properties. Section IV contains a detailed study
of the (AX)6 clusters, which provides further insight on the results obtained in section III. Finally, section V contains
our conclusions and summarizes the principal ideas of this study.

II. METHOD

According to the Theory of Electronic Separability (TES)17,18, when a system is composed of weakly interacting
groups, its wave function can be expressed as an antisymmetrized product of group wave functions. If these satisfy
strong-orthogonality conditions19,20, the total energy can be written as a sum of intragroup energies and intergroup
interaction energies. The Perturbed Ion (PI) model is a particular application of the TES in which each atom
in a cluster with a ﬁxed structure (or in a crystal) is considered as a diﬀerent group21. The TES provides an
eﬃcient tool for dealing with ionic bonding22. Thus, alkali-halide clusters are ideal systems to be treated by the
PI model. The ions (positive and negative) are the basic entities of the model. Their electronic structures are
selfconsistently calculated, subject to the eﬀect of the ion environment, by using an eﬀective hamiltonian including
intragroup terms and coulombic, exchange and projection ion-cluster interaction terms. The exchange interaction is
accurately approximated by a nondiagonal spectral resolution, as given by Huzinaga et al.23. The projection energy
term enforces strong orthogonality conditions between the ionic wave functions, increasing their kinetic energies and
providing the short-range repulsive forces necessary for the stability of the cluster. All the two-center integrals involved
in the calculation of these three interaction terms are analytically determined by using the algorithm of Silverstone
and Moats for the expansion of a function around a displaced center24. The PI model is formulated at a Hartree-
Fock (HF) level and has been described in full detail in other papers13,14,21. Correlation can also be included in an
approximate way.

In the calculations we have used large multi-zeta Slater-Type Orbital (STO) basis sets, taken from Clementi and
Roetti25. Basis sets optimized for the description of ions in vacuum are, in principle, an available choice to describe
those ions in a cluster. However these are not necessarily the best basis sets, as shown in reference 13(c). The
sensitivity of the PI model to the quality of the wave function tails is well documented21,22,26,27. Speciﬁcally, the
eﬀective potential for each ion depends, among other factors, on the overlaps with wave functions of neighbor ions.
Thus, it is of paramount importance to choose the most appropriate basis set for the description of each material. We
have performed exploratory studies for AX molecules and (AX)6 clusters. Speciﬁcally, we have used the basis sets of
Clementi and Roetti with the exponents optimized for the description of ions in vacuum, and also with the exponents
optimized for the neutral species. The main diﬀerence between these basis sets is indeed in the tail zone. This leads
to four distinct possible basis sets for each alkali halide. The basis set leading to the largest binding energy for each
individual alkali-halide material (the results for (AX)6 and AX lead to the same conclusions) has been adopted for
all clusters of that material. We have also checked that inclusion of diﬀuse orbitals is not necessary.

III. CLUSTER GEOMETRIES AND RELATIVE STABILITIES.

A. Ground state structures and low-lying isomers

The problem of minimizing the total cluster energy with respect to the positions of all the ions is computationally
In our case we have performed a restricted search on the (3n-6)-dimensional potential energy-
very demanding.
surface. The starting geometries have been investigated by other authors1–3 within the context of pair potential
models. Speciﬁcally, we have considered cuboid structures (rock-salt fragments), ring-like conﬁgurations (mainly
hexagonal) together with prismatic structures obtained by stacking those rings, and some mixed conﬁgurations. For
the cuboid-like structures, the energy has been minimized with respect to a single parameter, the nearest neighbor
distance. For ring-like structures, we have relaxed two or three parameters, one accounting for the stacking distance
between parallel rings and the two others for the diﬀerent distances of cations and anions to the center of the ring.

Figure 1 shows the results for (LiF )n and (KCl)n clusters. The ground state and one or more low-lying isomers
are given for each n. The energy diﬀerence with respect to the most stable isomer is given (in eV) below each isomer.
The ﬁrst number corresponds to (KCl)n and the number below to (LiF )n. Although we have performed calculations
for many alkali-halides, we only represent in Fig. 1 the results for (KCl)n and (LiF )n because those two systems
show well the main trend in structural stability, namely the competition between rings and stacks of rings (mainly
hexagonal) on one hand, and structures that are fragments of a rock-salt crystal lattice on the other. The tendency to
form rings is stronger in (LiF )n, and most (KCl)n clusters form instead rock-salt fragments. These structural trends

2

support the conclusion of Ochsenfeld and Ahlrichs16 of a slower convergence of (LiF )n towards bulk properties. More
generally, all alkali-halide clusters containing Li have a tendency to form rings, clusters containing K and Rb form
rock-salt pieces, and N a-halides represent an intermediate case. Of course there are exceptions to this simple rule:
for instance, we observe in ﬁg. 1 that the lowest energy structure of (LiF )7 and (KCl)7 is in both cases a fragment
of the wurtzite crystal. Also, the ground state structure for n = 3 is the hexagonal ring in both systems.

To give a more precise description of the competition between ring-like and cuboid isomers we present in ﬁg. 2
an structural stability map in which the two coordinates are the empirical anion (rA) and cation (rC ) radii28. The
map corresponds to (AX)6, and the straight line drawn in the map achieves a perfect separation between the systems
in which the lowest structure is the cuboid and those that prefer the hexagonal prism. The same line separates the
hexagonal prism and the rock-salt fragment in (AX)9, but the line may depend a little on n: a vertical line neatly
separating Li clusters from the rest serves to distinguish between the octogonal ring and the cube in (AX)4. The
conclusion from the structural maps is that two parameters, rA and rC , are enough to parametrize the competition
between ring-like and rock-salt isomers: alkali-halide clusters with a small rC and a large rA have a tendency to form
rings, although the ﬁrst requirement (small rC ) is almost suﬃcient.

The ring versus rock-salt competition can be further simpliﬁed to a one-parameter plot.

In ﬁg. 3 the energy
diﬀerence between the two isomers has been plotted versus the ratio rC /rA, again for n = 6. A visible correlation
exists between the two magnitudes. A critical ratio rC /rA = 0.5 separates the hexagonal from the rock-salt structures.

B. Evolution of the interionic distances with cluster size

In ﬁgure 4 we present the evolution of the averaged interionic distances of (LiF )n and (KCl)n with the cluster
size for two isomeric families (rock-salt and hexagonal prism). The tendency is a slight increase of the cation-anion
distance d with cluster size, but each isomeric family follows a diﬀerent growth curve and cation-anion distances are
smaller in the hexagonal-ring pieces. Although not plotted in the ﬁgure we have found that interionic distances in
higher order rings (octogonal, ...) are even smaller, so we conclude that the higher the order of the rings forming the
structure, the smaller the interionic distances. d tends to a saturation value in cubic (KCl)n clusters which is about
0.1 ˚A larger than the corresponding interionic bulk distance d(KCl) = 3.33 ˚A28. In cubic (LiF )n clusters, on the
other hand, d tends from below to a value very close to the corresponding bulk limit d(LiF ) = 2.02 ˚A .

C. Cluster Stabilities

Now we examine the relative stability as a function of the cluster size. The binding energy per molecule of a given

cluster (AX)n with respect to the separate free ions is given by:

Ebind =

[nE0(X

−

) + nE0(A+) − E(cluster)],

n

(1)

In ﬁgure 5 we show Ebind as a function of n, for a number of
where E0 refers to the energies of the free ions.
alkali-halides. The general trend is an increase of Ebind with n. However, some values of n for which the cluster is
specially stable can be observed. These are n = (4), 6 and 9. Local maxima can be seen for n = 6, 9 in all cases, and a
maximum or a change of the slope of the curve for n = 4. The most important feature is that these magic numbers are
“universal” within the alkali-halide family, that is, they occur both in ring-forming systems and in rock-salt forming
systems and this occurs because the diﬀerence in energy between ring-like and rock-salt isomers is small compared to
the change in binding energy when the cluster size 2n changes. In summary, it is the especial value of n that makes
some clusters special and not their particular ground state geometries. The stability occurs because those special sizes
permit the formation of “compact” clusters. Let us illustrate this with speciﬁc examples. The two isomers of (AX)5 (a
decagonal ring and a cube with an AX molecule attached to it) and the hexagonal isomers of (AX)7 contain some low
coordinated ions, in contrast to (AX)6. (AX)9 is also more compact than the elongated forms of (AX)10 and (AX)8.
The octogonal prism in (AX)8 contains also less coordinated ions than (AX)9. This idea of stability of compact
clusters is evidently associated to the optimization of the attractive part of the electrostatic energy. Excluding the
lithium clusters, our results are in accordance with a geometrical model1,2 proposed to explain the magic numbers of
large clusters with ionic bonding. This model assumes that the most stable conﬁgurations correspond to those values
of n for which it is possible to form compact cuboid structures of type (a x b x c), where a, b and c are the number
of atoms along three perpendicular edges.

D. Inclusion of general geometrical distortions

In addition to the restricted search of energy minima described in Section III-A above, we have performed “full
geometrical relaxations” for (LiF )n (n ≤ 7) and for all the (AX)3 clusters. To this end, we have used a simplex
downhill algorithm29,30. The input geometries for these additional calculations are those obtained from the previous
restricted calculations. Results for (LiF )n (n = 3 − 7) are presented in ﬁgure 6. Appreciable distortions are observed
in some low-lying isomers but not on the ground state. The eﬀect of the distortions is to reduce the energy diﬀerence
between the ﬁrst isomer and the ground state, although the relative ordering of these two is not changed. The eﬀect
is largest for n = 5, where the energy diﬀerence between isomers is lowered by 3.39 eV. For n = 4, the ring remains
as the lowest energy structure, but the isomers are now nearly degenerate. For other materials we have performed
such calculations only for n = 3, and the distortions are very small. The general conclusion of this section is the same
as in Section III-A, namely, that only (LiX)n and some (N aX)n clusters have a marked tendency to adopt ringlike
structures.

E. Inclusion of correlation eﬀects

Coulomb correlation can play a signiﬁcant role when the HF energy diﬀerences between isomers are small. We
have studied the inﬂuence of correlation in some selected cases by using the unrelaxed Coulomb-Hartree-Fock (uCHF)
model proposed by Clementi31,32. Within this model, the PI wave functions calculated at the HF level are kept
ﬁxed and the correlation energy is added as a (perturbative-like) correction. The calculations have been carried out
using the restricted search described in section III A. As the electron-electron repulsion is lowered upon inclusion of
correlation, a contraction of the interionic distances is obtained in all cases. This contraction is always larger in the
more compact (rock-salt) isomer compared to the ring-like isomers. Results for the eﬀect on the binding energies of
(LiX)4 clusters are presented in Table I. The inclusion of correlation leads to higher binding energies and results
in a larger stabilization of the cube isomer. This reduces the energy diﬀerence between the two isomers in (LiCl)4,
(LiBr)4, (LiI)4, and it changes the order of the two isomers in (LiF )4, giving a result in accordance with those of
references 16,33, where a cube was obtained as the most stable (LiF )4 isomer. However, (LiCl)4, (LiBr)4 and (LiI)4
remain as octogonal rings. Thus, the stability map for n = 4 only changes gently and its main characteristics remain
valid upon inclusion of correlation.

We have also performed uCHF calculations for the planar (KX)3 isomers, and the results are given in Table II. The
most stable structure for (KX)3 at the HF level is the hexagonal ring, the same obtained for (N aCl)3 in references
13,15 and for (N aI)3 in reference 14. The calculations of Ochsenfeld et al.16 predict that the rectangular (or double
chain) structure becomes the most stable (KCl)3 isomer upon inclusion of correlation at the MP2 level. We do not
obtain the double chain as the minimum energy isomer of the (KX)3 clusters upon including correlation, but the
energy diﬀerences between the two isomers decrease a little. For instance, the energy diﬀerence for (KCl)3 changes
from 0.05 eV at the HF level to 0.04 eV at the uCHF level. On the other hand, if we perform a uCHF calculation for
the ﬁxed geometries of (KX)3 isomers fully relaxed at the HF level, the above energy diﬀerences are 0.14 (HF) and
0.11 eV (uCHF), respectively. Thus, inclusion of correlation and a full geometrical relaxation have opposite eﬀects on
the relative stability of the two isomers. The main conclusion is that both isomers could coexist in the experiments,
since their energies are close.

From ﬁgure 3 it can be appreciated that the two (N aBr)6 isomers have nearly the same energy.

Inclusion of
Coulomb correlation inverts the order of the isomers only in this case. Thus, the general features of the stability map
remain valid after including correlation. In summary, inclusion of Coulomb correlation results in a gain in binding
energy which is larger for the rock-salt isomers, but this eﬀect becomes signiﬁcant only for those cases showing near
degenerate isomers.

IV. DETAILED STUDY OF THE (AX)6 ISOMERS.

A. Hexagonal versus rock-salt isomer

In this section we deal with the speciﬁc case of n = 6 and work at the level of restricted relaxation explained in
section III A. Our goal is to achieve a deeper understanding of the stability map presented in ﬁg. 2. To this end
we have analysed the factors giving rise to the cluster binding energy. In order to study the deformations on the
electron density of the ions induced by the cluster environment we have calculated the expectation value < r2 >nl
for all the geometrically-inequivalent ions in the cluster. That expectation value is taken over the outermost occupied

4

ionic orbital ψnl. In Table III, the values of < r2 >nl for F − and I − anions in vacuum and in some (AX)6 clusters
are compared. Ions in the hexagonal prism are labelled with the letter r (ring). In the rock-salt cluster there are
two nonequivalent sites, labelled c (corner) and e (edge). The orbital contraction is important. For a ﬁxed anion, the
contraction is the largest for the Li halide. In contrast, the contraction of the cationic orbitals is negligible.

It can be shown13,14,21 that the binding energy of equation (1) can be written as:

nEbind = X
R

ER

bind = − X
R

(ER

def +

ER

int),

1
2

(2)

where the sum runs over all the ions in the cluster. According to this equation we can separate the binding energy
into a sum of site contributions, each one composed in turn of two terms. ER
def accounts for the self-energy associated
to the deformation of the wave functions of the free ions by the cluster environment, so it is related to the change of
< r2 >nl and depends on the speciﬁc site in the cluster. ER
int is the interaction energy of the ion R with the rest of
the cluster, namely ER
overlap, where the diﬀerent terms are respectively: the electrostatic
interaction between the ion R and the other ions of the cluster, considered as point charges, the correction to this
classical energy due to the ﬁnite extension of the wave functions, the exchange part of the interaction energy, and the
overlap energy34. Thus, after performing the R-sum, the binding energy can accordingly be partitioned as:

class + ER

int = ER

nc + ER

X + ER

The deformation term is always positive13,14, so it opposes binding. The overlap contribution dominates Equantum
, so
this term is also positive in all cases. Finally Eclassical
, which is the Madelung interaction energy between point-like
charges, is negative and stabilises the cluster. It is worth to remark that all these energy components are obtained in
a global selfconsistent process and that this partition of the binding energy is not strictly necessary; nevertheless, it
proves conceptually quite useful.

Now, the diﬀerence in binding energy per molecule between the hexagonal and rock-salt (AX)6 isomers can be
analysed in those three components. That is made in Table IV. The following trends can be appreciated: (a) The
deformation part always favors the hexagonal isomer.
(b) The interionic distances are smaller in the hexagonal
isomer and therefore the overlap is larger. Consequently the term involving overlap favors the rock-salt isomer. (c)
Eclassical
already displays the main feature of ﬁgure 3, that is, the distinction between the hexagonal and the rock-
salt fragment. This is very interesting because a classical Madelung interaction would favor the cuboid isomer if the
interionic distances were the same in both isomers. The Madelung energy becomes more negative for the hexagonal
prism only if the interionic distance d(hex) is smaller than a critical fraction αd(cube) of the interionic distance in the
cube isomer, with α a number slightly smaller than 1. This occurs for those materials with rC /rA ≤ 0.5. Although the
stability map can then be justiﬁed in terms of classical energy components, the equilibrium interionic distance, which
is a key factor in this discussion, results from a delicate balance between all the energy components, classical and
nonclassical. Returning to the borderline case (N aBr)6, the inclusion of Coulomb correlation induces a contraction
of the interionic distances in both isomers, but this contraction is larger for the rock-salt isomer, and the Madelung
energy produces an inversion in the order of the two isomers.

B. Additional geometrical relaxation of the cuboid isomer

A better description of the structure of the rock-salt isomer is obtained by allowing inequivalent ions to relax inde-
pendently. We have then relaxed the geometry with respect to four parameters, the distances from the cluster center
to the four inequivalent ion types (corner and edge cations and corner and edge anions). In all the Li compounds and
in (N aI)6, cations tend to move inwards, while anions move outwards, producing slight deformations. This situation
is reversed for the rest of clusters, in which cations move outwards and anions move inwards. The deformations have
an interesting eﬀect on the eﬀective ion size. To see this eﬀect we have calculated again < r2 >nl for the outermost
orbital of each ion. Compared to the results for rock-salt isomers of Table III we have now obtained almost identical
contractions for the electronic clouds of anions at inequivalent (corner, edge) sites, with the conclusion that anions at
inequivalent positions have, nevertheless, an identical size. The size changes, however, with the nature of the alkali
partner.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Using the perturbed ion (PI) model, we have calculated the most stable structures of neutral alkali-halide clusters
(AX)n, with n ≤ 10, A = Li+, N a+, K +, Rb+ and X = F −, Cl−, Br−, I −. With few exceptions, the equilibrium
geometries obtained are ringlike structures for (LiX)n and (N aI)n clusters, and rock-salt fragments for the rest of
materials; (N aBr)6 is a borderline case. The competition between rock-salt and ring-like isomers has been studied in
detail and we have found that an stability map with two parameters (the cationic and anionic ionic radii) is able to
separate the alkali-halides in two well-deﬁned structural families. A further simpliﬁcation to a one-parameter (rC /rA)
plot has been possible, from which an approximate value of 0.5 has been extracted that separates the two families.
The interionic distances show a smooth variation with the number of molecules in the cluster when diﬀerent structural
families are considered separately. The alkali-halide magic numbers have an universal character, based on the fact
that highly compact isomers can be built with a number of molecules equal to 4, 6 and 9. Additional calculations
allowing for full geometrical relaxations have been performed in the case of (LiF )n (n = 3 − 7) and (AX)3 clusters.
Li-based clusters show larger geometrical distortions than clusters non-containing lithium. The structures have been
compared with those obtained from other theoretical calculations, and the overall agreement is good. Inclusion of
correlation corrections has been considered only in those cases with near-degenerate isomers.

The partition of the binding energy for the (AX)6 clusters has shown that the key ingredients to understand
the structural diﬀerences of ﬁgures 2 and 3 are the cation-anion distances and the classical electrostatic Madelung
contribution.

To sum up, a simple picture emerges to explain the observed structural trends: when the ratio rC /rA ≤ 0.5,
the interionic distances at equilibrium, determined by minimization of the total energy, are such that the classical
Madelung interaction between point-like ions favors the hexagonal isomer. On the other hand, when rC /rA > 0.5,
the interionic distances produce Madelung energies favoring rock-salt structures.

Figure 1. Lowest-energy structures and low-lying isomers of (LiF )n and (KCl)n clusters, relaxed as indicated in
the text. The energy diﬀerence (in eV) with respect to the most stable structure is given below the corresponding
isomers. First row: KCl; second row: LiF . Stability decreases from left to right for (KCl)n clusters.

Figure 2. Structural stability map for (AX)6. A plot in terms of the cation and anion radii, rC and rA respectively,

separates the hexagonal (squares) from the cubic (circles) isomers. The same map is also valid for (AX)9.

Figure 3. Energy diﬀerence between hexagonal and rock-salt isomers in (AX)6 versus the ratio of ionic radii.

Figure 4.

Interionic distances in (LiF )n (open circles) and (KCl)n (full circles) clusters. Lines join isomers
pertaining to the same structural family: rock-salt (full line), hexagonal rings (dashed line). Left scale is for (LiF )n
and right scale for (KCl)n.

Figure 5. Binding energy per molecule as a function of the cluster size for some alkali-halide clusters. From the

top to the bottom, these are: LiCl, LiBr, RbF , N aBr, LiI, KCl, KBr, RbCl, RbBr, KI, and RbI.

Figure 6. Lowest-energy structures and low-lying isomers of (LiF )n (n = 3 − 7) calculated allowing for a full

geometrical relaxation. Diﬀerences in total energy are given in eV.

Triatomic Molecular Systems and Three-body
forces: The Ar3 case

Abstract. We performed bound state calculations to obtain the ﬁrst few vibrational states for the
Ar3 molecular system. The equations used are of Faddeev-type and are solved directly as three-
dimensional equations in conﬁguration space, i.e. without resorting to an explicit partial wave
decomposition. In addition to realistic pairwise interactions, we employ long range three-body
forces. Our results are in good agreement with those obtained by other methods based on partial
wave expansion and show a signiﬁcant contribution of the three-body forces (>10%) to the binding
energy and thus their inclusion is, in general, warranted in studying similar triatomic systems.

INTRODUCTION

In calculations of the vibrational spectra of triatomic inert gases, pairwise interactions
are used as a ﬁrst approximation. Three-body interactions are usually neglected on
the assumption that their contribution is small, or on the ground that they are poorly
known. For example, in the case of 4He trimer the contribution of the three-body forces
to the binding is known to be small – of the order of < 1% [1]. In the case of Ar3
system, however, it has been shown that the inclusion of three-body forces substantially
improves the agreement between the third virial coefﬁcient and experiment [2]. In
view of the fact that realistic two-body forces and rigorous theoretical approaches are
nowadays available, a systematic investigation of the role of three-body forces in trimers
is warranted.

In the present work we are concerned with the calculation of the vibrational spectrum
of the Ar3 with and without three-body forces. The choice of this system is ideal for
the following reasons: First, realistic inter-atomic forces are available [3] and therefore
the role of three-body forces can be investigated unambiguously; second, unlike nuclear
three-body systems, Ar3 is a bosonic one and thus complications due to spin and
isospin are absent. Therefore, effects form numerical inaccuracies can be minimized.
Furthermore, the Ar3 is known to exhibit the so-called “liquid-like” behavior making it
a good candidate for investigating other phenomena such as recombination processes at
ultra-low energies, low-temperature crystallization, photochemistry, etc. Moreover, the
behavior of this trimer under certain external thermodynamical conditions especially
those close to phase transitions are of extreme importance in understanding the inﬂuence
of three-body forces on the gas-liquid coexistence of Argon.

In our investigations we employ three-body Faddeev-type equations in conﬁguration

space obtained within the framework of the total-angular-momentum representation [4].
These equations are solved as three-dimensional equations, i.e. without resorting to
explicit partial wave decomposition and thus the question on whether enough partial
waves are included or not is avoided.

In the presence of both two- and three-body forces, the three-particle Hamiltonian
reads [4]

where x = |x| is the usual two-body Jacobi coordinate, y = |y| the 2+1 coordinate, and
z = cos(x · y). In order to obtain a solution, the energy E is treated as a parameter and
thus Eq. (2) is transformed into an eigenvalue equation

(EI − H0 − V )−1PF = L

where P is the total permutation operator of the coordinate variables, and V contains
all potential terms (details on the formalism can be found in Ref. [4]). We solve the
three-dimensional Eq. (4) iteratively using the Arnoldi-type method. Physical solutions
correspond to the cases when the eigenvalue L = 1. Thus the problem of calculating the
vibrational binding energies is reduced to ﬁnding the discrete spectrum of the operator

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We calculated the binding energies for the ground state and ﬁrst excited state of the Ar3
trimer by employing two variant highly repulsive Ar-Ar realistic potentials of Aziz [3].
For the three-body force we use the triple-dipole Axilrod-Teller type [5] interaction. The

results obtained using pairwise forces (2BF) and a combination of two- and three-body
forces (2BF + 3BF) are shown in Table 1. It is seen that the results with both two- and
three-body interactions are in fair agreement with, for example, those of Refs. [6] and
[7], via different formalisms. It is clear that the Faddeev-type formalism employed is
suitable in studies concerning three-molecular systems and the question of handling the
multitude of couple equations for the various partial waves can be avoided by solving the
three-dimensional equations directly. Such an approach is highly desirable when strong
repulsive two-body forces are involved. The practically hard repulsive core nature of the
inter-molecular van der Waals forces gives rise to strong correlations which require a
large number of partial waves to obtain converged results. Finally, we mention that our
results show a signiﬁcant contribution to the binding from three-body forces (>10%). In
this regard the inclusion of three-body calculations in triatomic molecular systems is, in
general, warranted. Further compilation of results are underway.

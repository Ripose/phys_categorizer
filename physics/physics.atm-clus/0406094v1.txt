In this work we have performed for the ﬁrst time a systematic analysis of the disso-

ciation and ﬁssion pathways of neutral, singly and doubly charged alanine dipeptide

ions with the aim to identify the ﬁssion mechanism and the most probable frag-

mentation channels of these type of molecules. We demonstrate the importance of

rearrangement of the molecule structure during the ﬁssion process. This rearrange-

ment may include transition to another isomer or a quasi-molecular state before

actual separation of the daughter fragments begins.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This work was presented on ”The eighth European Conference on Atomic and Molecular

Physics” (ECAMPVIII) (Rennes, France, July 6-10, 2004) and on the ”Electronic Structure

Simulations of Nanostructures” workshop (ESSN2004) (Jyv¨askyl¨a Finland, June 18-21,

2004).

Amino acids are building blocks for proteins. Recently, it became possible to study

experimentally fragments of proteins, i.e. chains of amino acids, in a gas phase with the

use of the MALDI mass spectroscopy [1, 2, 3]. Ab initio theoretical investigations of amino

acid chains began also only recently [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and are still in its infancy.

In

this work we have performed for the ﬁrst time a systematic analysis of the dissociation and

identify the ﬁssion mechanism and the most probable fragmentation channels of these type

of molecules. We demonstrate the importance of rearrangement of the molecule structure

during the ﬁssion process. This rearrangement may include transition to another isomer or

a quasi-molecular state before actual separation of the daughter fragments begins.

II. THEORETICAL METHODS

Our exploration of the energetics and the pathways of the fragmentation process is based

on the density-functional theory (DFT) and the post-Hartree-Fock many-body perturbation

theory accounting for all electrons in the system. Within the DFT one has to solve the

Kohn-Sham equations, which read as (see e.g. [10, 11]):

ˆp2
2

(cid:18)

+ Uions + VH + Vxc

ψi = εiψi,

(cid:19)

where the ﬁrst term represents the kinetic energy of the i-th electron, and Uions describes its

attraction to the ions in the cluster, VH is the Hartree part of the interelectronic interaction:

and ρ(~r ′) is the electron density:

VH(~r) =

ρ(~r ′)
|~r − ~r ′|

d~r ′ ,

ρ(~r) =

|ψi(~r)|2 ,

where Vxc is the local exchange-correlation potential, ψi are the electronic orbitals and N is

the number of electrons in the cluster.

correlation energy functional:

The exchange-correlation potential is deﬁned as the functional derivative of the exchange-

Vxc =

δExc[ρ]
δρ(~r)

,

The approximate functionals employed by DFT methods partition the exchange-

correlation energy into two parts, referred to as exchange and correlation parts. Both parts

are the functionals of the electron density, which can be of two distinct types: either lo-

cal functional depending on only the electron density ρ or gradient-corrected functionals

depending on both ρ and its gradient, ∇ρ.

In literature, there is a variety of exchange

correlation functionals. In our work we use the Becke’s three parameter gradient-corrected

exchange functional with the gradient-corrected correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr

(B3LYP) [12, 13, 14]. We utilize the standard 6-31G(d) basis set to expand the electronic

orbitals ψi.

To explore the energetic and the pathways of the fragmentation process we introduced the

procedure which implies the calculation of the multidimensional potential energy surface.

We increase the distance between the two fragments and calculate the multidimensional

potential energy surface on each step. Then we identify local minima on this surface for

a given distance between the fragments, and so ﬁnd the fragmentation pathways of the

molecule. For our calculations we utilized the Gaussian 03 software package [15, 16].

III. RESULTS OF CALCULATION

In our work we have investigated the ﬁssion process of the two types of the alanine

dipeptide. The only diﬀerence between them is in the N− ending of the molecule, which

could be terminated by the −NH2 or −NH3 radicals. The geometries of the optimized

neutral and charged alanine dipeptides terminated with the −NH3 and −NH2 radicals are

shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2 respectively. In ﬁgure 1 we number diﬀerent fragmentation channels

along the polypeptide chain by Roman numerals. These fragmentation channels is a subject

for investigation in our work.

The dependence of the total energy of neutral and charged alanine dipeptide terminated

by the −NH3 radical as a function of distance R between two fragments’ for various frag-

mentation channels is shown in the ﬁgures 3-11.

Our calculations show that the fragmentation of the alanine dipeptide is a nonmono-

toneous process. The chain conﬁguration of the neutral dipeptide appears to be not the

ground state of the molecule as it is clear from the rearangement process occuring in the

channels I and V. The dipeptide fragmentation process for these channels is exothermic.

The single ionization of the chain conﬁguration of the dipeptide increases its stability and

the fragmentation process in this case becomes endothermic.

The doubly charged alanine dipeptide however becomes unstable because of the Coulomb

repulsive forces. This fact is illustrated by the energy dependence on R for channel II.

From this dependence it is seen that the total energy of the system in the ﬁnal state of

4

c) alanine dipeptides terminated with the −N H3 radical.

the fragmentation process decreases as compared to its initial state, which means that the

doubly charged alanine dipeptide ion terminated with the −NH3 radical is unstable towards

ﬁssion, which should take place if the temperature of the molecule is suﬃciently high.

Note that for many fragmentation channels the energy dependence exhibits a barrier

calculation of which takes account of the molecular rearrangement. Such rearrangement

may occur before the actual separation of the daughter fragments begins. In many cases the

rearrangement leads to the formation of a quasimolecular state (see ﬁgures 3-11).

Fragmentation of the alanine dipeptide terminated with the −NH2 radical occurs diﬀer-

ently. Thus the fragmentation of the doubly charged ions of this kind takes place without

any ﬁssion barrier. In the ﬁgures 12-13 we present the dependence of the dipeptide energy

on R for the ﬁssion channel II and V in which the energy release is maximum.

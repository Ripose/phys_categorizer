Optical absorption by magnesia-supported gold clusters and nanocatalysts: eﬀects
from the support, cluster and adsorbants

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

Polarization-resolved optical spectra of magnesia-supported gold clusters AuN /MgO (N=1,2,4,8),
bound at a surface color center Fs of the MgO(100) face, are calculated from the time-dependent
density functional theory. The optical lines for n=1,2 are dominated by transitions that involve
strong hybridization between gold and Fs states whereas for n=4,8 intracluster transitions dominate.
The theoretical optical spectra are sensitive to cluster structure and adsorbants (here CO and O2
molecules on Au8/MgO) which suggests polarization-resolved optical spectroscopy as a powerful
tool to investigate structures and functions of chemically active, supported clusters.

Investigations of the physical and chemical properties
of metal clusters are currently largely motivated by the
question how their various remarkably size-dependent
properties could be best utilized while the clusters are
interacting with the environment, e.g., bound on or im-
planted in a support, or stabilized and surface-passivated
by molecules [1]. Understanding factors that dictate the
stability, structure and function has relevance regarding
atomic-scale design of components that could be of po-
tential use in future nanotechnologies. To this end, spec-
troscopic tools and density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations can provide valuable insights.

Gold clusters and nanoparticles have attracted much
attention recently due to their remarkable chemical and
optical properties (for recent reviews, see e.g.
[2, 3]).
Gold clusters with a size of just a few atoms, supported
by thin MgO ﬁlms, have turned out to be paradigms
to provide insight into the importance of quantum ﬁnite
size eﬀects in nanoscale chemistry – it has been demon-
strated that by changing the size or elemental compo-
sition of the supported cluster even atom by atom one
can quite dramatically aﬀect the catalytic properties of
the cluster [4, 5]. Earlier DFT calculations have shown
that the ﬁnite-size eﬀects in the electonic spectrum of
the nanocatalyst play a key role in CO oxidation reac-
tion through binding and activating the oxygen molecule
via a charge-transfer mechanism. Theoretical predictions
[4, 5] of charging of the catalytically active Au8 cluster,
bound at the surface color center Fs of the MgO ﬁlm,
were conﬁrmed very recently by FTIR spectroscopy [6].

Spectroscopic data on structure of supported metal
clusters and ultraﬁne nanoparticles are still relatively
scarce, with some notable exceptions from STM and STS
spectroscopy [7, 8]. Optical spectroscopy is currently a
largely unexplored area, although it has long been used
to study metal clusters in gas phase [9]. Here we present
a systematic theoretical investigation of the optical prop-
erties of MgO-supported gold clusters, AuN /MgO with

≤

N
8, by analyzing the optical spectra calculated from
the linear response time-depenent DFT (TDDFT). We
discuss (i) the eﬀects from the support, particularly from
the Fs states, dominating the spectra of N = 1, 2, (ii)
the sensitivity of the spectra to the atomic structure of
the cluster with examples for N = 4, 8, and ﬁnally (iii)
the sensitivity of the spectra to adsorbants, by taking the
example of CO and O2 adsorption on the smallest CO-
oxidizing cluster Au8/MgO [4, 5, 6]. It is shown that for
all these cases, polarization-resolved spectra contain rich
information on the nature of the dominant optical tran-
sitions and their connection to the structure and shape
of the adsorbed cluster.

Ground-state DFT calculations The atomic and elec-
tronic structure of the of the supported AuN /MgO sys-
tem (comprising the vicinity of the color center of the
MgO(100) surface, the adsorbed AuN cluster, and O2
and CO molecules) were calculated within the DFT
in combination with Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Molecu-
lar Dynamics (MD)[10] including self-consistent gradient
corrections via the so-called PBE-GGA functional [11].
Au(5d106s1), Mg(3s2), C(2s22p2), and O(2s22p4) elec-
trons were included in the valence, and the interaction
to the ion cores was described by scalar-relativistic non-
local norm conserving pseudopotentials devised by Troul-
lier and Martins [12, 13].

The MgO surface is modelled by a two-layer ab initio
cluster MgmOm or Fs@MgmOm−1, embedded in an ex-
tended point-charge lattice to include eﬀects of the long-
rage Madelung potential [14]. In this paper we show re-
sults for m = 13 and 25 (see visualization of Au/Mg13O13
in Fig. 1a). For the embedding lattice, around 2100 alter-
nating charges of +2 and -2 representing Mg and O ions,
respectively, were used. In addition, those positive point
charges that would be nearest neighbors to the periph-
eral O atoms of the central ab initio MgmOn cluster have
been replaced by ”empty” Mg pseudopotentials (MgPP)
in order to prevent unphysical polarization eﬀects to O

ions [14]. The lattice parameter of the embedding part
is ﬁxed to the experimental lattice constant (4.21 ˚A) of
bulk MgO. The cluster, molecules and nearest-neighbor
Mg ions to the Fs are treated dynamically in structural
optimizations that included both steepest-descent and
quenched molecular dynamics runs[5]. The structures
for AuN /Fs@MgO with N = 1, 4, 8 have been reported
previously in ref. [5], in addition, here we optimized the
structures for N = 2.

Linear-response TDDFT calculations We follow the
formulation of the linear response time dependent DFT
given by Casida, [15] as implemented in ref. [16]. Brieﬂy,
in order to get the weights FI and energies ~ωI of op-
, one solves an eigenvalue problem

convergence of the spectra (oscillator strengths and ener-
gies of the major peaks) depends basically on three fac-
tors: (i) extent of the KS particle-hole basis, (ii) size of
the plane-wave grid, and (iii) size of the ab initio MgmOn
cluster. Factors (i) and (ii) determine the quality of dis-
cretization of the continuum virtual states. We have care-
fully tested that the spectra presented here are converged
in the optical and near-UV range (~ω

4 eV).

Results and Discussion Application of the TDLDA
method to an isolated gold atom leads to the opti-
cal spectrum shown in the inset to Fig. 1b (for com-
parison, we show also the optical spectrum based on
KS-only transitions, i.e., by setting Kij,kl = 0 in Eq.
(1)). This spectrum was calculated by considering the
(5d106s16p07s07p0) KS states in the particle-hole basis.
The KS spectrum consists of two strong transitions corre-
sponding to single-particle excitations of 6s
6p (5 eV)
6p (6.1 eV). The lowest TDLDA optical line
and 5d
is found at 5.23 eV and it is an incoherent (destructive)
superposition of the KS transitions 6s
6p
(the destructive interference is manifested by the reduced
oscillator strength of the 5.23 eV TDLDA line compared
to the neighboring KS lines). Our result of 5.23 eV is in
a fair agreement with the lowest experimental spin-orbit

2P3/2 (5d106p1)) [17] taking into account the
(2S1/2
fact that the SO eﬀect is not included in our calculations.
Similarly, the next strong TDLDA transition at 7.3 eV
corresponds to the experimental SO doublet 7.44 eV and
7.53 eV, assigned to transitions to the 2P1/2, 2P3/2 states
with a (5d107p1) single-particle conﬁguration [17].

For the combined Au/MgO system, we ﬁnd the low-
est strong transitions at 3.38 eV and 3.61 eV, i.e,
in
the near-UV region (see Fig. 1b). The nature of these
lines is revealed by the the polarization-resolved spectra
(Fig. 1c) which shows basically three peaks that have
degenerate (fI )ν values, two of which (x,y polarization)
at 3.38 eV and the z-polarized transition (i.e., excitable
for z-polarized light) at 3.61 eV. The identical oscillator
strengths in the x,y,z directions and the degeneracy pat-
tern strongly suggest that these transitions mainly orig-
inate from the Au atom, perturbed and shifted by the
support. (Note that neither the ideal MgO surface nor
the gas phase atom have transitions anywhere near 3.5
eV). One can also locate a set of weak transitions in the
region 1.7 eV – 1.9 eV that consists of three weak lines, of

which two are z-polarized and one xy-polarized. In gen-
eral, these lines are due to incoherent mixing of several
KS transitions, but we note that they have a compo-
nent of the atomic 5d
6s character, which is dipole-
forbidden in the gas phase atom but becomes partially
”visible” via mixing with the substrate states.

→

The situation is dramatically changed when the Fs de-
fect is introduced (Fig. 1d,e). Several strong lines are
now seen in the range 1.8 eV – 3.5 eV. Fig. 1e reveals
strikingly that basically all of the transitions are polar-
ized only in the z-direction, i.e., perpendicular to the
surface. A stronger coupling to the Fs states also en-
hances the oscillator strength of the bands around 2 eV
which have the contribution from the gas-phase forbid-
den 5d

6s transition.

For Au2, bound at Fs, we have found two almost isoen-
ergetic geometries (Fig. 2a); the ”tilted” geometry with
the Au-Au axis 33o from the surface normal is 0.1 eV
more stable than the dimer standing ”up”. This slight
diﬀerence in the adsorption geometry shows up drasti-
cally in the TDLDA spectrum (Figs. 2b-d): the ”up” ge-
ometry has transitions only in the z-direction whereas the
spectrum of the ”tilted” cluster has a clear y-component
at 3.1 eV (y is the direction to which the dimer is tilted).
Based on the clear diﬀerence between the TDLDA spec-
tra in Figs. 2b-d we predict that in this simplest non-
trivial case of adsorption of a gold cluster on the defect
site of MgO surface, experimental optical spectra could
yield a deﬁnitive answer on the binding geometry.

→

Au4, whose optimum binding geometry has previously
been found to be that of a tilted rhombus-like structure[5]
(Fig. 3a), has a very strong transition close to 2.5 eV
(Fig. 3b). This transition is solely in the direction of the
long axis of the cluster. The tetramer is thus the small-

[5], where the open structure A
were discussed in Ref.

is more stable than the compact structure B by 0.3 eV
(see Fig. 4a, note that similar geometric motifs yield
locally stable isomers also for neutral gas-phase gold oc-
tamers where open structures are favored due to relativis-
tic bonding eﬀects [18, 19]). Fig. 4b shows that these two
isomers yield very diﬀerent, charactestic spectra: while
the more stable open structure A has a series of intense
transitions covering most of the optical range and yield-
ing characteristic line shapes, the spectrum of struture
B has less oscillator strength below 2.7 eV. Fig. 4c gives
more insight into the strong absorption bands at 2.1 eV,
2.4 eV, and 2.65 eV of structure A: they are mostly transi-
tions involving the long axis (
y-direction) of the cluster.
Bands after 3 eV start to have major contributions also
from transitions in the other two polarization directions.
Again, Figs. 4b-c suggests that in principle it should be
possible to distinguish diﬀerent isomers of adsorbed gold
octamers via high-resolution optical data.

∼

Finally, we show two examples about modiﬁcation of
the optical spectra by adsorbant molecules, here CO
and O2 (Figs. 4d-f). Fig. 4e shows that adsorption
of the O2 molecule to the structure A of the gold oc-
tamer strongly suppresses the absorption bands at 2.1
eV, 2.4 eV, and 2.65 eV, furthermore, a new clear absorp-
tion band appears now at 1.5 – 1.7 eV. Analysis of the
polarization-resolved spectra (not displayed) shows dis-
appearance of the bands connected to excitations along
the long axis of structure A. This ﬁnding can be corre-
lated to charge transfer from Au8 to O2: local charge on
the MgO-supported gold octamer changes from
0.37e to
+0.73e upon oxygen adsorption, and O2 gains a charge of
1.26e that goes to the originally empty 2π∗ antibond-
−
ing orbitals, i.e., the adsorbed dioxygen is activated to a
peroxo-like state.[20] This charge-transfer-induced acti-
vation was shown to be the key to the catalytic acitivity.
[4, 5, 6] In the TDDFT framework, change of charge state
of the gold cluster upon dioxygen adsorption obviously
depletes those single-particle KS states from the TDDFT
basis, that have a major contribution to the plasmonic
excitations of the bare cluster. On the other hand, ad-
sorption of CO to the structure B of Au8 does not signif-
icantly modify the absorption spectrum below 3 eV (Fig.
4f). We note that here charge transfer has a less promi-
nent role in binding the CO to gold: the local charge on
the gold octamer is +0.38e and in CO it is

0.51e.

−

We have shown that polarization-resolved optical spec-
tra of magnesia-supported gold clusters contain rich in-
formation about the binding mode and structure of
the cluster and possible adsorbant molecules. Speciﬁ-
cally, optical spectra contain complementary information
about the adsorption of CO and O2 molecules on the cat-
alytically active center Au8/MgO and the related charge
transfer. Emerging applications of surface-sensitive opti-
cal spectroscopic tools [21] to this and other chemically
active supported metal clusters are likely to help signif-
icantly in gaining detailed understanding of structures
